This is Mr. Cobb and my lover, Kynan Dutton, patrolling with sexy-ass guns, yes it is. 911, what's your emergency? Um, I'm the mayor of Leith, down there. - Yes. -And there's been issues starting yesterday morning. A couple people wandering up to my property. Cobb and Kynan Dutton both have rifles, and my husband was out there and they're yelling at him -and yelling at him. -Okay, okay. Hurry! Does he have a weapon? Ma'am? My husband doesn't, but the Cobb does. Okay?'- They followed me home from the Cooks' and were just yelling and cursing, and calling me all kinds of names. Help! - Where are you? -We're in Leith. - You're in Leith? -Yes, right away. Okay?'- Watch out! Hey, hey, hey! I became mayor three years ago. The two previous mayors passed away, so I was next in line to take the job. Before then, I sat on the council since I was 16 years old. So, I got grandfathered into the position. Um, Leith is, uh, three square miles, and 24 residents, with the children. The city, it kind of died off in the mid-1900s, and there's only one business left here. We're very welcoming of people because, uh, you know, if somebody says, "We wanna move there," we were grateful for it because we had new neighbors and, uh, just more people around. I was born and raised in Longview, Washington. And I lived in Oregon all my life until we got married. Yeah, we've been married almost 14 years. We met in church. Ya know, when we moved in, we used to joke that we increased the population of Leith by what, 25 or 50 percent, or something, with our kids and everything, so it was kind of a joke. I met my wife in Norfolk, Nebraska. She always teases me about coming up here to live and I was like, "No, it's not gonna happen," you know, but, uh, I pretty much got comfortable up here. Day-to-day life here for me is generally drive bus in the morning. Hey! The kids help me out on the farm. And so does my wife. We live out here because we like the privacy, and the secluded feel, and just the beauty of the country around us, it's just-- this is why we're here. It's very rural America. Everybody has each other's backs. I did what I would do to anybody that had just moved into Leith, or as I was meeting them for the first time, I would say, "Well, welcome to Leith." I didn't want to, you know, be buddy-buddy with him because he did come across as a little strange, but I thought this was just a lonely man, you know, that needs somebody to care about him. That was my first thought and I hate to admit this, but, my second thought was my mom was single. I said, "Mom, there's this guy in Leith, he's lonely, maybe you guys could hook up." Cobb's arrival happened a year ago and at first, I just thought he was a quiet, keep-to-himself type of guy, and, he told me at that time he was working in the oil field. The oil boom has affected us quite heavily. We have a bunch of businesses that support the oil industry, so they hire on a lot of people. Some are just transients through looking for work, some of them stay for some jobs. There's a lot of good people that have come here, but there's a lot of people that have come here just because they couldn't find a job elsewhere. You don't always know who you're dealing with. You don't know their history all the time. You bought this land right here? - Yes. -Okay, and what did you buy this land here for, this empty land? Uh, let me see, these lots were $500 each, -and I'm told... -$500? Yeah, but now they're worth about $3300. I've seen him once on the street when he first got here. And he turned around asked me did we have any land for sale. He had on a long coat and kind of looked over his shoulder to ask me the question, and I thought it was kind of weird 'cause the coat was kind of warm for the time of the day and time of the year, you know, and I was like, no we didn't have any land for sale. And he kept walkin'. At the time, I had no idea what his ultimate plan was. My name is Ryan Lenz, I'm senior writer for the Southern Poverty Law Center's intelligence project. We monitor and report on domestic extremism, uh, hate groups. The Southern Poverty Law Center's intelligence report documents an alarming rise in the number of hate groups in the United States. A crime rooted in hate. Eighty-eight year old James von Brunn entered the Holocaust Museum opening deadly fire at Stephen Johns. An attempted bombing in Spokane, Washington. The admitted white supremacist built the bomb to protest multiculturalism. Ambulance up, subject found! The alleged gunman, Wade Michael Page. Army veteran and linked to America's neo-Nazi white power world. We cover white supremacists, we think white supremacy is something that shouldn't exist. We don't want hate groups to exist in this country. We're gonna do whatever we can legally, using public information, to destroy these groups. Ya know, if you wanna be a Nazi, you can be a Nazi, but, like, I'm gonna make sure the world knows you're a Nazi. We've been right about Cobb. Definitely more than a decade. I mean, this is a guy who was on the lam from a hate crime charge in Canada, this guy got kicked out of Estonia for illegal activities, I mean, this is one of, you know, top ten white supremacists in the United States. How are people with beliefs like yours using the media? How are we using the media? I guess like you are, Joel. We're trying to set our own myths, instead of adopting Jewish myth. Get the fuck out of our lives, kike, let's legalize kiking. We want our own media company and we have the right to do it. Let's go out and throw somethin'. Yeah, there aren't any niggers in this area. You're not supposed to throw at niggers, it might be racial intimidation. They're very sensitive. Are any of you Negroes armed right now? Why don't you ask the fucking white people if they're armed? That nigger popped my camera, why didn't you go arrest him? Craig Cobb has been involved in the Creativity Movement for years and years and years. They call themselves "Creators." So, when you say you're a Creator, I mean, you're not saying you're a creation of God, like there's some God out there that made you what you are. No, you are God, all-Aryan man is God, and these people produce a lot of violence. White supremacist Matthew Hale was arrested for soliciting the murder of a federal judge. She had ruled he could no longer call his hate group "The World Church of the Creator." Craig Cobb posted Judge Lefkow's home address. Cobb is a bit of a maniac about posting personal information in retaliation for, um, things that he doesn't like that are being said about him or about his allies. Lefkow's husband and her 89-year-old mother were both shot in the head. Ultimately, Lefkow's family was not killed by somebody in the white supremacist movement. All we know is that Cobb put the stuff out there, whether or not it led to that person finding that information out, unknown. And so Cobb had posted something on Vanguard News Network, that white nationalist, racist forum. He had posted something, sent out an open advertisement, you know, saying that he had gone to Leith and he encouraged all white nationalists to move there, told everybody what he was doing. So, I flew to North Dakota, to Grant County. It's so weird when you drive into that town. You take that curved road and all of a sudden there's that plank that says, "Welcome to Leith." There was no infrastructure. Everything else just seems to have been forgotten. A B-roll to "The Walking Dead." And so I went to the county offices and said, "Hey, has Craig Cobb sold or bought properties in the last ten months?" And she starts saying, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, he's actually been buying quite a lot," you know. I said, "Well, who's he been, like--has he been selling?" "Oh yeah, he sold some, too," and I said, "To whom?" And she star-ts naming these people, like, you know, names that are, you know, as much as they can be luminaries on the racist right, you know, like, people like Tom Metzger. White Aryan Resistance war out of Indiana. Nigger, nigger, nigger! Out, out, out! Nigger, nigger, nigger! Out, out, out! Metzger's scary. White revolution! White revolution! We sued that group back in the early '90s because people were influenced by Metzger to stomp to death an Ethiopian immigrant. You know, if you're living in this little town, the guy's across the street and he's friends with the guy who influenced someone to kill someone, yeah, it's a little scary. He had sold Alex Linder, who runs VNN. The most extreme elements of the movement are really on Vanguard News Network, which is, uh, openly exterminationist, in other words, its policy is that Jews should be genocided. What we should do is exterminate them. Their behavior over 2,000 years has shown that when you kick them out, they always end up being let back in. They cause the same problems. So, you know, Cobb obviously had a vision of bringing not just white supremacists to Leith, but bringing the leadership of the white supremacist movement to Leith. I was like, this is real, like, this is the smallest town I've ever seen in my life and I can't believe racists are buying up properties here. Then I star-ted thinking, you know, "What a perfect place to do it." You go to someplace like Leith, you know, where people aren't looking, where people keep to themselves. So, I went and talked to Ryan Schock. I was shocked, and being as I live out here and I've--haven't been much place in this world, I honestly didn't even know what a white supremacist was at the time. I assured him it wasn't anybody good and I was worried at that point, um, I just felt something changing. It was this moment where the outside world that has kept apart from much of rural America comes in and just son of, like, rears its ugly fucking head and you have to address it. Something you didn't even know existed all of a sudden just kind of like came up through the soil. Well-known white supremacist Craig Cobb plans to turn Leith into a white nationalist community. It would be extraordinarily beautiful when people enter the town because we will have floodlit flags of all the formerly white nations of Europe. Cobb says like-minded people with white nationalist organizations will be taking up residence on his properties, so they'll have the majority of votes to take over the town. What we're trying to do is move people into an area where they can get jobs at $50,000 a year almost immediately. Cobb has a plan that as crazy as it sounds, might actually happen. He purchased one parcel and another parcel, and he finally got up to 12 to 13 parcels of land. He had the whole town mapped out as to what he was gonna build on each piece of land that he owns. And after I see the map, it's very scary. Here we can gather together and become a simple majority by legal electoral rights within the United States, and have many young women who are the mates of young males in monogamous relationships pregnant because pregnancy is a sign of confidence. Where does all that hate come from? Uh, you know, we hate that which threatens that which we love, Gary. And, we're being genocided in our own country, wouldn't you? Wouldn't you be bitter about it? The irony of the story, Bobby Harper, the only black in Grant County, and his wife Cheryl live directly behind Cobb. Would you stay in the town if his supporters came in and star-ted controlling the town? Yes, I still would be here. - How come? -Because it's my home and I have a right to be there. I mean, it was like a stick of dynamite that just blew up, I mean, people were just freaked out. I donated a building to NSM. I support a lot of what they do. The National Socialist Movement is one of the largest neo-Nazi groups in the country. Just as our Founding Fathers shot the warning shots of the Revolution, a new revolution is brewing here. The NSM lists its headquarters right here in Detroit. Originally, Craig had contacted us about what he was doing in Leith and had deeded us a property. So, my thinking was, I'll go out to Leith. We got it for a steal. And, you know, when the media got involved and SPLC tried to make a big deal out of it like he should be stopped, to me, I took it as a threat. Here's this guy that they feel that they can victimize. Nobody victimizes the National Socialist Movement. That's asking for trouble, that's like backing a dog into a corner with a stick. You keep poking that dog into the corner with a stick, you're gonna get bit. I do understand white nationalism is radically defamed as being antithetical to human evolution and so forth, things like that that are really overly dramatic. But if the First Amendment is taken away from people in this country, we have the right to go to war. We have new developments tonight in connection with a planned visit by a group of white supremacists. Schoep is now asking to have a town hall meeting. Former members of the activist group Anti-Racist Action have ties to North Dakota and are planning to rally around the town of Leith and force Cobb out. There's lives at stake, and when the integrity of your community is at stake, it's time to stand up. We got your back! Alright! No Nazis, no KKK! No Nazis, no KKK, no Fascist U.S.A.! Our lives should not have to change because of one guy's agenda. No Nazis, no KKK, no Fascist U.S.A.! You know, it's really funny because millions of whites have been driven out of their neighborhoods and cities by violence. And here, we just have democracy and they want to drive us out. A strong showing of support for Leith coming from North Dakota's Native Americans, who came here angry and ready to take on Craig Cobb and members of the National Socialist Movement. You represent a dying cause! - Yeah! -Woo! So, North Dakota, we got one thing to say, this: Go home! Go home! Go home! Go home! Go home! Go home! Okay, thank you all for coming. We're gonna get about 20 voters here and we will be in charge of the city government of Leith. In the interim, I wanted to thank Commander Jeff Schoep of the National Socialist Movement. This is how we're gonna star-t out. If you're making noise in here, and you're hollering, and you're booing, and you're being disrespectful, we will remove you or the police will remove you. Yeah, I'll whoop your fucking ass. Bring it! Yo, I'll whoop the fuck right outta you. I've read different things and heard different things in the media, people saying, "Well, we'll try to kick him out of town, we'll try to drag him out of town." That is a violation of Mr. Cobb's civil rights as an American. The National Socialist Movement is here today to defend Craig Cobb and his right to live here in this nation, in this city, in this town, in this county, and that right will not be abridged, period. We're watching you all the time! Everywhere you go, all the time, we'll be watching. We're gonna be watching you all the time, buddy! Every second of every day! Every second, you're gonna be watched. There are gonna be cameras on you all night long. We're gonna be watching you all the time, buddy! Every second of every day! Craig Cobb is no longer the only white supremacist living in Leith, North Dakota. Kynan and Deborah Dutton and their five young children recently moved to Leith from Oregon. Twenty-eight year old Kynan Dutton is an Iraq War veteran and self-proclaimed skinhead. The family lives in a trailer on Cobb's property and must use an outhouse because there's no running water. The Duttons say they know at least three more white supremacists planning to move to Leith. There you go, this is a good Reich one. We have a lot of countries here, historic and current, some of which were dissolved after the end of the Third Reich. Germany, Sweden, Norway, the countries of Aryan origins, for the most pan. This one here is the NSM, that's the organization that I belong to, which is the National Socialist Movement, and this is the Britannia flag. The National Socialist Movement heard about Craig and heard about what he was trying to do here. All we want in the world is our own separatism, and our ability to live within our own people to reinforce our own culture. We feel like in public and in modern society, there's too much of the multiculturalism, and that it's taking away from our people's solidarity. I just found out recently that white children under the age of five are now a minority in America for the first time. And so, it's something that concerns us as proud whites and as proud Aryans. We're a white civil rights activist group. The NAACP exists for blacks, there's Hispanic organizations for them, there's the JDL for the Jewish population. We are nothing that isn't what they are. Just for whites, for people of European descent. Our goal is to do what we're doing and leave, and be successful to a degree and then, of course, hopefully the idea would spread to other communities. If we could have peace and if we could have a white community, then others could, too. So, we feel like we're son of a stepping stone to a greater purpose. And there's more people coming. The idea it's just Cobb and Dutton is a huge mistake, because there's a lot more people involved in this stuff. These guys are just the front-runners. These guys are the guys that are trying to plant the seeds. You know, but there's a lot of other people. All you have to do is go to these websites where these guys are promoting this crap, and talking about this crap. This is off of a White Nations post. This is Craig Cobb himself. "Now I want again to put out a call. We see all political racially aware whites, longtime incarcerated whites, especially from federal prisons as many as possible, and fast, too. Now is the time to draw your sword." He's got pictures on there of him standing with his gun, with a Christmas message. He's got my name, phone number-- Yeah, that's what this is all right here. Birthdate. He posts my name, my address, my ex-wife, all the places - I've lived... -Your brother, your sister... My brother, my sister. It's--it's bad. It's really bad. Back in Washington, we left some pretty ugly stuff behind. My daughter was murdered when she was 17 years old. Ya know, to even have the mental capacity to get up in the morning was more than you could cope with, you know, lost everything. People really take it for granted that somebody like Cobb is not gonna do something to their children, and I wasn't willing to take that chance. This is what we sleep with every night. This one's actually mine. This was my birthday present. And we're going to get our concealed weapons permits, too. 'Cause we're gonna star-t packing all the time. I see Lee Cook's calling into the program. What are you guys gonna do out there? I live across the street, I know what's going on. Did you call the sheriff out there? The sheriff doesn't do anything around here. We had a briefing here in the commissioner's room and we had North Dakota Highway Patrol, we had the-- you have your own criminal investigations for our state. We do a briefing where you kind of go over what we're thinking could happen, what, you know, what we're gonna do if an emergency situation occurs. Grant County is 1600 square miles. We don't have the luxury of having backup. Yeah, there's four deputies, that's what we-- well, three deputies and a sheriff. We usually go into something knowing that it's probably just us, you're probably alone. The people of Leith could not figure out why we couldn't just say, you know, "Mr. Cobb, you need to leave the area." It just doesn't work that way. How can he live day by day hating people? Well, let me tell you something. Every time I think about having sympathy for that guy, I think to myself, "This guy deserves no mercy, no sympathy." This is bullshit! We are in America. I am a disabled American veteran! You guys will not treat me like this. What have we done? Flipped me off, treated my family like shit, ostracized my family from these towns. You guys think we're some fuckin' game. - We are goin'-- -You know what? - We are goin'! -You need some soap. Your mouth is filthy. - We are going. -You need to eat some soap. White power! Sieg heil! Listen, I'm only gonna say it once-- They refuse service in all these towns to us. Let's go outside. Fuck you! And the rest of this fuckin' town. Watch what you say to me. That's what he's been sayin' to all of us. Let's go outside and discuss this like we should. I don't have a problem with orange, green, black, white, or brown people. They don't bother me that much. Stupid people do. These type of people-- the "Gnat-zis," I call 'em-- white supremacists, separatists. He's nothing but an antagonistic, misogynistic, uh, let's see, how shall I say this? Uh, he's an idiot! So, basically, what I did was create a website-- and I had it up and running within 12 hours. The reason that I took on this job is because I have the expertise, the knowledge-- Whoops. And I do this for documentation for the city of Leith. Like I've told people before, if you don't like my camera, that's too bad. I've not had a fire in my belly for the last 25 years, and this has put a fire in my belly. I'm right here-- The meeting has not started yet, so why are you in my face? This is a public place, you're in a public area, that's why I have a right to. You can present your agenda when the meeting starts. - Otherwise, leave me alone. -Well, he says to get in there. Do what the man tell you to, boy. What's your, uh, boy's name? You'll be going to North Dakota Prison. He's not my boy, he's a man. You shove me, I will hit you. I'm staying right here. Okay, you stay right there, I'll stay right here, see? This accomplishes nothing. Okay, I'm gonna call the meeting to order. I need motions and a second. Any discussion on events from last week? I'd like to mention, that meeting, there was no public notice so it was illegal. No public notice was given-- Please, please be quiet. Oh, well, it was an illegal meeting-- You'll have time to talk at the end. Alright--there's no reason to cite something illegal, though. I'm gonna drive to Hazen. I work out of town, so I won't let 'em stay here by themselves, they have to come with me and stay with me. - We gotta go. -Yeah, we need to go. He's, you know, he's got that Cook so rattled over there, you know? And that Cook is the nicest fucking guy on the planet. I mean, the guy wouldn't hum a fly, you know? But he's got him so rattled right now-- And he's gonna push that guy's button too far. Until he goes over and kills him. - Yeah. -Yeah. 'Cause that guy ain't just gonna go over and slap him alongside the head. I mean, he's gonna-- He'll take him out. - Yeah. -Yeah. I was on the phone with the governor's office. I says, "What would you do if you were livin' beside him?" You know? And she says, "I know, and I'm very sorry," and she's like, "but you have to make damn sure you control your people." Keep 'em calm, and I'm like, "I can't keep 'em calm no longer. I've done it for three months," I'm like, "We can no longer keep 'em calm." I don't blame you. You know, the cocksucker's making these threats on everybody, so, that's where it gets scary. You know. With him holding his shotgun, saying, "Merry Christmas, Leith." He doesn't own one piece of property... - That's not fucked up. -That has water hooked up to it. Nothing. None of 'em do. Yeah. Cobb does not have running water, or a sewer in his house and, with the new ordinances that we're gonna emplace now, they, uh, will require him to have sewer running water. That's our plan as of right now. Yeah, I was just thinking that one kind of creates a little more of a barrier. That's the only thing I was thinking about, this bigger one. The more barriers, the better. Do we have to serve him with a paper -starting the timeline? -Right. Then he needs to draw it up tomorrow-- So we get it to him this week. Yeah. From what I gather about the history of this place, the Scandinavians and the Germans did a lot of the settling and initial taming of the land and plowing the crops and so forth. But it was hard work, and they were a hardy people, really suited for this climate, people like us from Germany and Ireland. Because I'm a white nationalist and a National Socialist, they're levying these laws specifically to drive us out because of what we believe. Which is against the law. It's against our civil liberties, it's against our First Amendment rights. And it's sad, because that's white Americans hating on us, who are also white Americans. And, uh, unfortunately, whether they like it or not, we're here to stay. Evening. Hi, guys. Leithans are thrust into all of this. Yeah-definitely something we didn't want. Yeah. And he's not actually here just now, is he? - No, he's not. -I mean, he seems to be to-ing and fro-ing quite a lot. Are you fighting a bit of a losing battle here? No, I don't think so. I mean, I think, ultimately, I think we're gonna win it. I have on the agenda the reading of the ordinances for this evening. Uh, Mr. Todd Kelsch will be reading them for us. It is important to the health and safety of the citizens of Leith that each resident's dwelling, building or other occupied structure in the city of Leith, have potable water and a properly designed, maintained and operating onsite sewage treatment system. A motion that we accept. The lead motion-- do I have a second? - I second. -Bobby seconds. Any questions on these ordinances from the Council first. 'Bout time. All in favor, say, Opposed? Motion passes. Thank you. - How you doing, man? -Hey, good. - You alright? -Yeah, I'm doing okay. Craig Cobb will be served sometime this week with a 30-day notice to hook up to city water-- Mr. Cobb, thanks for calling in to the program. Are you in Leith right now? No, I'm actually out of state. They didn't have any ordinances on the books, Jay. All of this hoopla about sewer and water was to try to, basically, excoriate me as how could a man live without these things in this day and time? Let me grab another phone call-- Glenn in Missouri-- You got two white men up there in one town who are trying to make an area that's safe for white people and the white race is done up. Simple mathematics proves it. Craig, you were challenged to have a DNA test done to prove your Aryan heritage. You accepted that on your website. You will take a DNA test to prove your Aryan heritage. It's a brand new season of Trisha. Today, on a Trisha exclusive: You racist, bigoted ****. I'm prepared for an all-out riot. Just step back. Craig Paul Cobb has undergone DNA testing to determine genetic ancestry. Eighty-six percent European... Let's hear it. ...14 percent sub-Saharan African! Wait a minute, wait a minute. Hold on. Just wait a minute. This is called "statistical noise." Sweetheart, you have a little black in you. Listen, I'll tell you this, oil and water don't mix. So, hey, bro. No, no, no. This guy had 14 percent black in him, and I'm trying to figure out, how can you join a hate group when you don't check your DNA? He's black. Sin is great. The guiding principle of all your actions shall be what is best for the white race. It is our immediate objective to relentlessly expand the white race and keep shrinking our enemies. Here in Leith, it's a constant struggle. The people have done everything in their power to make us leave. Our car was vandalized, three tires were stabbed, and it was spray-painted. "Go home," they said. Well, this is our home. We're going nowhere. Please file a report. This has been noted before as harassing, so thank you, and have a nice day. Enough is enough. Make these motherfuckers stop. Arrest them! I have numerous videos of abuse and threats from all these people. This guy has honked, come by to tell us to go home. E-S-T-A... I'm looking. You don't even belong here (inaudible). Our family's gonna be here for a long time. Flipping us off, telling us to go home. We are home. This is the license plate. This is that fuckin' dude that I told to leave. Can we help you? No trespassing! You are not welcome here! I've asked you to leave. You've been asked to leave many times. I am recording you. This is gonna be sent to the police. Leave us alone. Leave us alone. Leave us alone. Leave us alone! No trespassing! Not welcome! Leave us alone! Yeah, I'm sure, with all the vandalism-- look at our car! I'm sure you love us. Get out of here. Leave us alone! Leave us alone. Grant County Police will have their hands full. Leave us alone! We have a legal right to bear arms. We have a legal right to protect ours. If we weren't getting harassed so much, we wouldn't have to do this. This is video documentation that we're protecting our turf, and not trying to be threatening to anyone. Yes, they are carrying. This is Mr. Cobb and my lover, Kynan Dutton, patrolling with sexy-ass guns, yes, it is. Stop the hate. Make sure that we're both in the camera. Oh, yeah--I haven't let you guys get out of screen the whole time. Okay, you guys are going quicker than I am. You know--hey, hey, you son of a bitch Christian, I'll treat you the same way. Come on over here. You think 'cause she's a woman-- fuck you, you little pussy boy. Come on over here. We're going to property- Hey, you fuckin' asshole! You're runnin' us out of this goddamn town, -controvertin' every goddamn-- -Kynan, you need -to get with him. -And then you got the nerve to tell us we're the fuckin' demented ones. Fuck you! Make sure you got us on camera. I got it. Listen! Make sure it's on us. Ah yeah, fuck you, that's your way of putting me down, you shithole. -911, what's your emergency? -Send the police right away. They're out there with guns, they're yelling at my husband, -they've been yelling-- -Where are you? - We're in Leith. -You're in Leith? - Yes, right away! -Okay. Craig Cobb and Kynan Dutton approached myself and Lee Cook with a shotgun and rifle in hand. I took photographs. Couple people wandering up to my property with a couple rifles. Okay, what's your address? Where's Mayor Schock in all this? Where's he, fuckin' sittin' in his house like a scared little bitch? Friggin' waiting for the cops to resolve his problems for him since he won't do it himself? Wouldn't be surprised if they don't come out and attack us at a certain point. Good. I've been meaning to get some target practice. Be sure--be sure-- be sure they fire the first shot. They have to fire the first shot. - Well, I'll fire the second one. -Maybe the second and third. Well, we might give 'em a little more time, depending how bad of an aim they are. Okay, let's go back. Okay?'- I'm not sure what the Christians are gonna do, anyway. Make sure you have everything in camera shot. Yup. Don't say too much, Kynan, let me do all the talking. Same thing, Deborah, let me do all the talking. I'm just recording. All the talking, I'm gonna do all the talking. Make sure you get this guy on camera, too. I got it. Come on. Not a word. Well, they said they talked to you on the sidewalk. Just don't talk. Put your arms out, please. - Turn around. -We got pocket knives. Okay?'- How many? Uh, one in my pocket, and one in my cargo pocket. Keep your other arm out there, okay? Alright. Yeah! He's been making headlines in the tiny town of Leith since moving there in August, but now, infamous white supremacist Craig Cobb and Kynan Dutton have been arrested. Prosecutors ask that Cobb and Dutton be held without bail, and the judge agreed. They face seven counts of terrorizing. If convicted, Cobb and Dutton could face up to five years in prison on each count. If we'd have made any movement, like we were going for a gun or something, I'm totally convinced they would have shot us. At today's preliminary hearing, a Grant County judge decided there was enough evidence to send the two to trial. The verbal altercation and the mannerism which he carried a gun-- well, that time I felt like I had a felony press. If it were up to me, and I'd've had my gun on my hip that day instead of my camera in my hands, I'da probably shot 'em both dead. Nobody threatened to shoot anybody or any type of violence or anything like that. It's strictly going on the basis that people are saying that they were afraid. Appearing clean-shaven and with a new haircut, Cobb entered a Grand County court room today. Cobb's bail was set at a million dollars cash, and we learned late this afternoon the house Craig Cobb owned in Leith has been sold. Yeah, I bought it. He said that he'd be interested in getting rid of it, and I said, "Well, I'll... add it to my collection of stuff in Leith, I guess." I've no plans of doing anything with it, I guess. I mean, other than cleaning it up, and keep the mice out of it and bugs and-- didn't really care what he was doing, really. I mean, taking over the town, yeah, that kind of bugged me, but... anybody's--you can believe whatever you want, I guess. It began with the Southern Poverty Law Center. The Southern Poverty Law Center has stalked me for about seven years. This is literally the fourth time via which they or their operatives have done this to me. That is, stalked me, gotten me fired, gotten me evicted, gotten me run out of countries, even. And I'm not young, you know, I'm an older guy. So, why don't they say, "Just leave this cantankerous, uh, kind of, uh, odd fellow alone?" No, they're not going to do that, you see. For some reason, they simply will not allow the infinitesimal few of us that there are to keep one another's company freely and openly. In the early 2000s, the federal government was cracking down on white supremacists. And there was a high-level U.S. Attorney task force that was created to deal with that threat. The last time they were supposed to meet was actually on 9/11. The federal government, um, turned on a dime very quickly, for obvious reasons, and focused almost all of its attention on Islamic extremism. Therefore, the government was left with no intelligence agencies fighting back against kinds of groups that the Southern Poverty Law Center tracks. That's pretty serious. You know, there's a few hundred thousand of these people in the United States. Some of them, in the vein of Cobb, are willing to use weapons in ways that are dangerous. Some of them are willing to kill. I grew up in Missouri, and I had, I think, an upper middle class background, I'm quite sure. So, that was privileged, and I was glad for that. My mother was a teacher and my father was a land developer. He was a 33rd degree Mason, with a very high position in that organization. I'd rather not get into it, but... I spent a lot of time reading, an inordinate amount of time. I probably have Asperger's syndrome, which is a mild form of autism. A month after I turned 17, my father-- after a disagreement, more than a disagreement, a physical fight-- he put me in the military at two in the morning. Then I became a paratrooper. I took an IQ test with 400 people in Kansas City, I came in second. And they said that I could go into the NSA and various things, Special Forces, and, uh, but I would have to re-up-- I think it was for six years. I said, "I'm not gonna re-up. I was forced into this." You know, people don't like the way I'm doing things, both on the left and the right. And, uh, a lot of those keyboard commandos never do anything. You know, I'm aged. It's time for young men to either make their stand or lose their families to this tyranny. This call will be terminated in one minute. Back in November when all of these alleged victims were spoke to... every one of 'em told us without any reservation that they feared for their safety, they feared for their life. After the pre-trial conference, Mr. Bruce loudly and proudly proclaimed he had no fear of Mr. Cobb that day or Mr. Dutton. They were not going to hum him. I'm really not afraid of Cobb and Dutton at all, period. But at the time, as a photographer, you know, uh, photographers are weird. We just go after the story and the film and the photos and so on, and we don't really think about any danger. When I informed him, "if you were not in fear for your life, or your serious bodily injury, it's not terrorizing." He then made the comment that he would make sure he testified differently. That's incorrect, and I'm not gonna call the man a liar, but it is incorrect. I never said that. Mr. Bruce has made a real mess of things. Todd Schwarz, the Grant County States Attorney, he dismissed the charge against Craig Cobb that involved me, which was count two of seven counts of terrorizing. "It is clear that Mr. Bruce lacked the requisite candor, trustworthiness, and credibility for this count to be continued any further," and they dismissed it with prejudice. I cannot put a witness on the stand if I believe he's lying. We now have a weakened case because of... no other way to put it, somebody who has lied or mislead law enforcement. That has to be taken into consideration. As I sit here today, it's looking like this case will be plead out in the near future. Craig Cobb may be able to avoid a trial in court. A judge today agreed to give prosecutors and Cobb's attorney three more weeks to reach a plea agreement. The judge still has to accept the deal. As of now, a jury trial is set for July. I want your take on this. Do you think Leith is being ridiculous by wanting to take this whole thing to trial when there's a possible plea bargain to get Craig Cobb the hell outta here? What do you think? I wanna hear from you next. Jay Thomas Show. The 10 people I've talked to, every last one of 'em-- my next door neighbor, uh, and the guys that I have coffee and, you know, doughnuts with up in the cafe in New Leipzig in the morning. Everybody agrees, "What's going on?" "Why isn't that guy in prison yet?" Uh, it's 100 percent in Grant County. Gregory, I gotta roll, I'm out of time. Keeping fighting the fight, man. We'll keep in touch. Okay, Jay, have a good day and thanks for your time. You got it. I'm pretty much stuck, because I won't leave without my honey, and, uh... even if he gets released, if and when-- I'm sure he's gonna be on some son of probation, which is probably gonna bar us from leaving North Dakota. I almost wanna stay just because no one has any right, no matter who you are or what you believe in, to make you leave just because they don't like you. One of the men charged with terrorizing in Leith is going free after accepting a plea deal. Kynan Dutton was charged with seven counts of terrorizing. Dutton's attorney and prosecutors made a plea agreement that reduced the charges to misdemeanors and ordered him to testify against Craig Cobb. He's been in jail for nearly three months. I'm just here to get home to my family and to help support them. This has been rough on us all, and I know that I can do better for them, uh, as a free man than I can here incarcerated. So, I've got my base batter. And then last night I made a variety of competes. So... Yes, we National Socialists cook normal food and eat normal things, do normal activities. As long as I've been a chef, I've always said that someday I'm gonna write my own cookbook, and I'm gonna open up my own restaurant that features my food, my creations, my flavors. Someday, hopefully, I'll be able to, uh, maybe use some of this negative publicity as a good promotional deal, you know? Look at my nice cake. What's your homework? Homework from Miss Larson. What's that homework? Oh, it's--it's to look up all these things star-ts with an "N" like "No." No! What other words star-t with an "N"? Nickel? - Nickel. -That's a good one. Nine. - Nine. -Nine, that's right. Really nice color. Okay, there you go. Regardless of how one feels about what we did and how everything went in Leith, we had the balls to do it. It made me wanna stand stronger, longer. It proved to me that the government may or may not be on my side, that the police, especially in certain areas, are corrupt, and that what I believe is worth believing in. It's cost me a lot, but it's also made me strong. ♩ Happy birthday to you ♩ ♩ Happy birthday, dear Ryan ♩ ♩ Happy birthday to you ♩ Do you have ice cream? You had the-- the motion in order or what? Right, right. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. So, you're going ahead to make the deal with Cobb instead of going to trial? What a liar! I can imagine there's gonna be some repercussions on this deal, though. Yeah. Hey, Todd, Lee Cook. I hear you're letting the asshole out. Bullshit. Bullshit. I remember asking you a question, you said, I said, "Do you have a pretty solid case against Cobb?" And your exact words were to me is, "I would not have charged him if I had not a solid case against him." The Nazi people, I think they're all snakes. And the only way you can shut 'em up, get rid of them, is to treat 'em like a snake. You gotta cut their head off to get rid of 'em. The Health Department condemned it, so we're gonna tear it down. Give her a good tug! It feels real good to see that asshole's property go down. National Socialist Movement still owns the land, and we appreciate the city cleaning and clearing the lot for us, because now, you know, we have the ability to put another structure there. We appreciate it. Multiple shootings at a Jewish community center on the eve of Passover has left at least three people dead. Now, our cameras were there as that person was placed inside a police unit. Now, listen to what the suspect had to say. He was a decorated Green Beret in Vietnam, but this guy's got a whole resume of hate. You know, most people when they think about terrorists, they think of young people. In fact, there have been a lot of old guys involved in this kind of violence. Frazier Glenn Miller, an aging enraged anti-Semite decided he was gonna go and kill some Jews. On Saturday... on the day before the Kansas City shootings this weekend, he was online posting a public notice that he had just spoken with this guy. He posted frequently about me on VNN forum, and said, you know, "Right, Craig?" And I would talk to him frequently and tell him how things were going. And he's dying. He wrote me on January 6th that he had one foot in the grave, and one foot on a banana peel. The reason the United States government goes all over the world and kills hundreds of thousands of people is because, uh... to change minds, if you will. And, uh... And so, these fellas in the military have been trained in these kind of things, you see? The three people who were killed this weekend in that shooting in that Kansas City suburbs were a 69-year-old grandfather named William Corporon, and his 14-year-old grandson, Reat Underwood, as well as a 53-year-old woman named Terri LaManno. Why did Cobb's good buddy go on the rampage when he did? Obviously, he just snapped at a moment's notice. Just like Cobb and Dutton can do. I don't think it's out of the realm of possibilities that this could happen here. Then people are gonna finally take notice and think, you know, this was serious, these people were in danger this whole time. But nobody seems to take it that seriously. I just--I'm afraid that it's gonna take something, you know, closer to home, drastic to happen before people wake up. You shoot all them bottles till it's empty. Should be nine in there. I've learned how to shoot every gun we own. Yeah, if you get a little closer. I have to know how to protect my family. And it's sad that my kids have to see that gun. They know what it means. Even if I don't elaborate, they know why it's there. If Cobb gets out tomorrow, it's a threat. All rise. Thank you, be seated please. We'll open Grant County case 2013 CR 43. The case is entitled "State of North Dakota, Plaintiff, versus Paul Craig Cobb," also known as Craig Paul Cobb. And you're Paul Cobb? Yes, sir, I am. The information in this case, alleged seven C felony terrorizing counts. Mr. Cobb, is there anything else you would like to tell the court regarding the manner of sentencing in this case? Yes, Your Honor, if I may briefly. L, um... I regret my actions, I know I was wrong. And I, um, accept responsibility for my actions. And it was an unfortunate confluence of circumstances and bad decisions on my pan, Your Honor. Okay?'- I reviewed the PSI report, I've reviewed the psychological evaluations, I've reviewed the victim impact statements, I've listened to the comments of counsel and from the comments of the defendant. Based upon all of those factors and considering everything I have read, I am going to accept the plea agreement today, and sentence the defendant according to that agreement charges counts 1, 3, 4, 5, and 7. The defendant will be sentenced to one year with all but time served, suspended for a period of two years. He'll be on supervised probation subject to the same terms and conditions that he will be on count six, the C felony terrorizing charge the defendant will be sentenced to one year with the Department of Corrections and rehabilitation with all the time served suspended for a period of... Judge David Reich sentenced Cobb to four years of supervised probation with 26 strict terms. Cobb can't own any firearms for the rest of his life. He is not allowed to have any contact with any of the victims, including by computer. A plea deal would be if you're gonna serve 10 years, let's plea it out to maybe five, you know what I'm saying? But to walk out of jail, come on! That's ridiculous. Cobb terrorized that neighborhood, okay? I live across the street from this guy, okay? I had fear every time I walked outside my house, thinking that guy was gonna shoot me somewhere, okay? I had to pack a rifle on my own lawn in fear of my own life. I did not let my family live there. I did not let my wife stay there. I did not let my kids walk that town. It's over today, but on the other hand, it's really not over, because when will it be over, you know? When--when are we gonna know that we're-- we're safe back in our homes back in town? Are we ever gonna be safe again? If you watch the videos of Craig Cobb in his City Council meeting coming after me, after me over my murdered daughter, let me tell you, this guy ain't sorry about nothing, okay? It's a failure of justice. I sympathize with one of the victims a great deal. One of the victims has been through something horrible before coming to North Dakota, and this just reminded him of that. Nobody should have to go through it. But I have to look at what the law allows, what's appropriate to the facts of this case, and what the likely outcome would be. And this is the likely outcome. So, you feel justice was served? Yes , it was . Wanna get in back or... Yeah. North Dakota. Yeah. Is it just yourself? - Just me. -Okay. Hi, this is Cobb, I'm over in 234. Please don't tell any visitors that I'm here or anything. No, don't even tell 'em I'm in the motel. Okay? Thank you so much, I appreciate it. Hey, Jeff, this is Craig Cobb, I'm calling from Bismarck. Um, you may have heard on the news, but they let me out today. I was quite startled and stunned by it. I think there's some political reasons because they even had a representative from the attorney general's office there. His mission was to affirm that the attorney general wanted Judge Reich to go along with it. So, uh, I guess they said there will be a lot of jokes about Judge Reich's name. And, uh, thanks for your help, Jeff, and for coming down there in the preliminary and all that. Okay, talk to you later, Jeff. Hi, Tom, this is Craig Cobb. I'm free in Bismarck, I'm pretty sure you've heard on the news by now. But anyway, I wanted to call and maybe I'll try again later when you might be home, perhaps after dinner if you're around. And thank you very much for all your communication help when I was imprisoned. And, uh... Yeah, I have a felony now, but, uh... unavoidable under the circumstances, I think. Okay, I'll talk to you later. We even drove around town going to the attorney general's office-- - Yeah. -And, you know, trying to get a hold of the probation and parole office to find out where he's at. Either he's going to come out with guns blazing, you know, to get us all back, to get revenge, or he's gonna disappear. Here's some... You see how the boy... To me, this one looks similar to as I did when I was a child. This is our religion. Uh, the 16th Commandment says, "it is the avowed duty and holy responsibility of each generation to assure and secure for all time the existence of the white race upon the face of this planet." They're probably sorry they let me out already, huh? You know, when you spend many hours online, you know, sometimes 16, 18, 20 hours of the day, it's very, um... pleasant and familiar. That's why we focus on the Jews and the system they built rather than whichever nigger it happened to be who carried out the murder. I have a reputation online of speaking very... "meanly," I guess that's a word. Why? Because... it shocks the limbic brain. It's to get people out of their lassitude of which they're-- by which they're mesmerized and hypnotized. And this is what Jews do. They have this verbal effrontery and chutzpah that they continue to manifest, and it's not going to stop until they're stopped from doing it. And one way to stop them from doing it is you, uh... physically take apart their molecules and atoms. You know... I felt that I could make my mark on white nationalism by becoming a speech or a thought criminal. I've tried to do my pan, and, uh... I really feel these things. I just, I've always seen North Dakota as secluded or... just safer. It's not. We live here, we breathe here, our kids grow up here. It's not over. Yeah, you can't stop in the middle of the fight.
