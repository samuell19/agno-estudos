- henrietta! hand over the baby, henrietta. - No, I changed my mind, I can't, I can't. - We talked about this. - it's my baby! - hold up, hold up! - come on, you are slowing down. you can keep up with me. - so I know we said we should do more hobbies together, and I totally agree. But when I said we should run a half marathon, that was dumb. That was very dumb. You know, why not like wine club? Or spa club? Is that a thing? You know, if it isn't, we could make it a thing. We could be pioneers in spa clubbing. - Babe, you are being a baby right now. We have, like, a mile left. Come on, I'll race you to the house! - no way, you go on ahead. I'm gonna-- - come on! - I'm gonna hang here and throw up, I think. family tree dna test, when'd you do this? - Excuse you, it is very rude to read over someone's shoulder. - You do have such nice shoulders. - Thanks. Hey, do you remember when your family went on that pilgrimage to ireland to figure out what quaint little village your great-great-grandfather was from? - Of course. It was the best two weeks of my life. Well, until my aunt cindy got drunk and tried to get into a fist fight with cousin travis. - Well, I guess I realized that I want that. Not the fist fight part, but the knowing. I don't know anything about my family history. And since my mom and dad passed, it's-- - babe, it's okay. I know how hard this has been on you. - All I want is to know where I come from. And I mean, if we're gonna be starting a family soon, it's important that we know my family medical history. - Yeah, you're right, we should. If I were in your shoes, I would want to know too. - Thanks for having my back. - Course. - So anyway, I sent my saliva sample to this genetic testing lab a few weeks ago, and like a lunatic, I have been checking it every day to see if the results have come in, and nothin'. - Candace, just so you know, all I care about is that our kid is 50% you. If that happens, I know she will be smart, beautiful, and a way faster runner than me. - you are the greatest. - Yeah, I'm all right. - Okay, I gotta go to work. - You're right, yup, me too. One thought, though. - What? - Well, I mean, if we're gonna be having a baby, there's probably something we should be doing. - Yeah, what's that? No! Sean, you're gross and sweaty, no! - Now we're both sweaty and gross. - No, but you are really, really sweaty. - Yeah, you know what? Maybe we should take a shower first. - Ooh, yeah, I like that idea. - Yeah? - Yeah. - All right, let's go. - No, sean! - goin' up! - no, no, no, no, no, sean! You can't finish a run with me, but you're gonna carry me up these stairs? - that's right, I just found my strength. - it's you! It's you, candace burke. I've been doing research. It's you. - I'm sorry, sir, I don't know what you're talking about. I really need to get to-- - wasn't right. It wasn't right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry! - Mr. Rossman, you know you're not supposed to leave the grounds unaccompanied. I'm sorry. - It's okay. - It's all right. - I'm sorry! - all right, calm down, mr. Rossman. - Hey! whoa, you okay? you seemed a little frazzled. - I'm sorry, I'm fine. I just got a little spooked back there. - In the parking lot? - Yeah. - An oakmont resident? - Yeah. Normally, they don't bother me, but this guy was-- - creepy? it's okay, you can say it. Old people are creepy. - No, that's not what I meant. - Those wrinkled creeps are always sneakin' up on me. Every time someone makes a break for it, they wind up going straight to my parking spot. And they all think I'm their granddaughter. - yeah, this one just got to me, I guess. Anyway, what have we got goin' on today? Has mrs. Coolidge arrived yet? - Nope, canceled, so you have time to hear all about my date last night! - Do I have to? - Okay, so remember the bumble dreamboat guy with zero body fat who I am going to marry? - Todd? - No, todd was like two months ago. I'm talkin' about paul, tall paul? - My god. - Yeah, he's 6-4. - No, my dna results are in. - My god! Yes, yes! - half irish, half dutch? That's it? - What were you expecting to find? - I don't know, I mean, you hear stories all the time about people finding their relatives through these things, and reuniting with long-lost loved ones. I just thought that-- - sweetie, those cases are rare. Unless you have other people in your family tree who willingly post their info, all you get is basic genealogy results. - I know, I know. I just kinda thought it would give me a little more information on where I came from than this. what? - Do you remember my friend margot? - Yes, long brown hair, smart. She works for the times, right? - Yeah, margo has contacts in law enforcement that might be able to track down your family. I don't know how it works, but I think they have access to, like, all the consumer dna test results, plus their own database. - Really? - Yeah. She said they can find pretty much anybody. - Okay, allie, I would never ask you to do this if it wasn't really important to me. - I helped margot register her beagle as a service animal, and that thing is not a service to anybody. she owes me. - thank you, son. - Dutch and irish, that's it? - That's all it said. - Maybe you should have another dna test done. When my sister had her dna done, she found out that she was german, russian, italian, even 5% native american. - Yeah, well, aunt cindy is also a serial liar. - Compulsive, actually. - No, now, come on. - Yes, yes, she is. - Aunt cindy just has a very active imagination. okay. - I think I'd like her. - active imagination. - Cheers. - Yes. - hey, I'm sorry they stayed so long. I know you gotta go in early tomorrow. - Hon, I love your parents. They can never stay too long. Your mom, she was funny tonight. - Let's not forget, you had great parents too. I mean, they may have not been related by blood, but they were good to you. - No, I know. I was lucky. I mean, of all the random strangers that could have adopted me, I got the kindest, most supportive ones. - You did. - Hey, do you think I'm being selfish, wanting to know so badly? Is it somehow tarnishing their memory? - No, no, of course not. I mean, you know that I support you completely, but I mean, have you thought about how you'll feel if your parents aren't perfect, if they're not everything that you imagined? - I mean, I'm sure I'll love them no matter what. - Sure, but that's the thing. I mean, families can be tricky, like my aunt cindy. You know, I mean, yeah, she's hilarious and outspoken, but she also drinks way too much. Or my uncle charlie. I mean, my dad won't even speak to him. I mean, he had a falling out after my grandma died. - Yeah, I know this. What's your point? - Families have dark sides too, that's all. - Okay, what are you saying, sean? That I shouldn't try and find my parents anymore? - No, no, of course not. I just want you to be prepared if they're not perfect. yeah? - Yeah. - I'm pretty sure she's. - Actually, can you tell-- - when she finds out-- - I mean, I freaked out, it's crazy! - Hey. Candace, this is margot. - Hi. - You remember what I was-- - yes, I totally remember! Hi, good to see you again. - Hi! Good to see you too. Do you have a private place we can go talk? - I do, why? Did you find something? - Yeah, and it's pretty crazy. - You're gonna want to hear this. - Okay. Well, my office is right around the corner. I don't know if I'm ready for this. - so I am not supposed to do this, but I got my friend in law enforcement to run your dna through the system, and he can say, with 99% certainty, your father is tom mason. - wow. sorry, why does tom mason sound so familiar to me? - have you ever been to mayfield? - Yeah, sure. Sean and I were looking at a place out there, but I mean, it was way out of our price range. - Well, the masons are, like, real estate royalty in mayfield. - Yeah. - I grew up there, and you couldn't go anywhere without seeing their faces on billboards and coffee cups. They also had this commercial-- - yeah! mason's realty, quality houses they make your family dreams come true - I can't believe you remember that. Well, besides owning that real estate company, they also have a wing in the hospital named after them, they own minority stake in a ton of local businesses. Plus, they run a charity. - They, like, own mayfield. - Yeah, they do. - Wow. I was not expecting any of this. Margot, this is blowing me away. Thank you, seriously. I don't know how I'm ever gonna repay you. - My gosh, no, this was my pleasure, are you kidding me? I write about criminals all week. This was like a vacation. Besides, I would do anything for allie. - Except date my brother. - Yeah, no, I'm not doing that. Have you met her brother? - Wow! Wow! You are missing out. - No comment, okay? Do you think I look like him? - Yeah. Tom's eyes are exactly like yours. Right? - Thought so too. It's a little eerie. - So, are you gonna call them, or? - I don't know. - What do you mean I don't know? - It's intimidating, allie. I mean, I know this is what I wanted, but what if they don't want to meet me? Maybe jeanette felt too young to be a mom then, or was too career-driven, you know? Maybe tom wasn't ready for kids either. I mean, they couldn't have been married that long. They did give me up. - Candace, you are an amazing person. You have a handsome-as-hell husband, you live in a dream house, and you save children for a living. You have won in life. Trust me, they're going to be so happy to meet you. - Yeah. You're right, they should be happy to meet me. - Absolutely. - But I think I'm gonna shoot them an email first. - Fine. But if they don't email you back, you're calling. And if they don't answer, we're driving to mayfield ourselves. You're meeting your parents. - Okay, deal. come on! - what, still nothing? - No! It's been two days. Do you think it could have ended up in his spam folder? You know what, I'm gonna write another one. - Or call. - Yeah, maybe. Allie thinks I should just go there, get it over with face to face. Is that crazy? Will I look insane if I just show up at their real estate office? - Look, there are a lot of things I wouldn't take allie's advice on: Men, how to balance a checkbook, also men, but she might be right about this one. If what you want is answers, meeting with your parents face to face is probably the best way to get them. - You're right. Allie's right. I gotta do this. Will you go with me? - Yeah. - Best husband ever. - I'll tell you. hi. I'm looking for tom and jeanette mason. - You're in luck. I'm tom mason. Thank you, cynthia, I'll handle this. Right this way, miss-- - candace burke. - Candace. go right through here. - Thank you. - Grab yourself a seat. Would you like anything, coffee, tea, water, what? - Water's great, thank you. - So are you one of the new associates at locklear-rivington, or are you just in the market for a beautiful new home? - Neither, actually. - Okay. - I apologize for just showing up at your work like this, but, gosh, okay, sorry. I don't really know how to say this, but, okay. I'm your daughter. I just blurted that out. Let me explain. I did a genetics test, and did you give up a daughter for adoption 30 years ago? - No, it's my baby! no! no, no! - no. - No, you didn't? - No, I didn't. I'm sorry, but you must have me confused with someone else. - Our dna is a 99% match. - Our dna? what is this? - You know that site family tree dna? I did a-- - okay, miss burke, listen. Pretty sure I would know if I gave up a child for adoption, right? So I'm very sorry, but this is just some kind of misunderstanding. - Look, I understand if you don't want to have a relationship with me. I know this is a lot, but I'm really just looking for information on my medical history. - No, it's my baby! - My husband and I-- - my baby! no, my baby! No, no, my baby! My baby! no! - you know, my husband and I-- - I understand, I'm sorry, but I can't help you. - Please, just-- - I don't know what kinda scheme this is, but this comes to an end now. - Scheme? I am not-- - is this about money then, is that what this is? Because you wouldn't be the first person to try to blackmail me or my family! - I do not need your money, and I would never try and blackmail anybody. Would it be possible if I just talked to mrs. Mason? - All right. You need to leave, now. Bruce, alex, can you come in here, please? If you attempt to contact me again, I will call the police. - Mr. Mason, I just, I'm-- - I will call the police and I will call my attorney, and there will be legal repercussions. Do you understand? - Hey, is everything okay? - Everything's fine, boys. My sons will see you out. - Yeah. - Right this way. well, we hope you got what you came here for, miss. whatever that was. - yeah, that was weird, right? - He denied he was my father. I never got to meet my mom. He just lied straight to my face, sean. - I'm so sorry, honey. - I don't get it, I don't understand why he would be so cold. - Hey, listen. If he did that, he doesn't deserve you. He doesn't. - I know, it just hurts. - I know. Hey. Let's go home. I'll get takeout from saggio. We'll watch a rom-com of your choice, and veg out for the rest of the night. That sound good? - Yeah, thanks. - well, it was her. I knew this was bound to happen one day. - you told me there was no way she could ever find us. - Well, she took one of those dna tests or whatever. - How would the test lead to you? - Boys got me a test last christmas. I told them that I wanted the results to remain private, but I guess it somehow ended up on the internet. - well, this is a problem, isn't it? - No, it's fine, I'll handle it. - Really, you'll handle it? Like you handled it last time? - Don't push me! You have no idea what I went through to make this thing go away! And you have no idea what I am capable of. - Sweetheart, we can't have this coming out, not when we're in this merger with rivington-locklear. If it falls apart, imagine what would happen to our business, to our sons. - You don't think that I know what's at stake here, jeanette? You're not the only one who runs this company! Now, I will handle it! - Good, because there is nothing more important to me than our family. pbeat music) - maybe it was just too painful for him to think about? - No, no, no, that doesn't matter. I mean, the way he treated you was vile! Honestly, I don't know. - What? - What? - Okay. Full disclosure, the main reason why I asked you guys to lunch today, besides the fact that, p.S., I love that we're hanging out, but when I found out that tom mason was your father, it just, I don't know, it set off journalistic alarms for me. - What do you mean? - Well, tom and jeanette mason are exactly your typical couple that gives up a baby for adoption. I mean, think about it. They have so much money. They obviously could have provided for a child. And then when she finally goes there to talk to him, the way he treated you? It's just strange. So I may have continued to dig, just a little bit. - What do you mean that you continued to dig? - Well, when I feel something that's off, I mean, I'm a reporter, okay? I'm gonna keep digging till I find the answer. - Okay, but-- because if you want me to stop, I will stop. I mean, this is your story and I respect that. - You're just not gonna, like, print this as a story, or anything, right? - My god, no, no, no, no, no. This is between us. I'm not sending this to my editor. This was me just going with a gut feeling and just wanting to help a friend, okay? - You deserve to know the truth,, you do, and she is the best chance of finding it. - No, you're right, and I appreciate it, I do. Since I contacted them and since tom treated me like I was insane, like I was nothing, I don't know, something has switched inside of me and I feel like now, I can't stop until I know the truth. So you're right.- - Good! All right, I'm so glad you said that, 'cause I did the initial background check, and I did find one thing. They bought out the old vice president who helped start the company. His name was felix rossman. So this is a picture of what he looks like now. So I'm gonna find him, interview him, and see if he remembers anything about the time you were born, 'cause he was there. - Rossman. - Do you know him? - Allie, this is the guy that scared the crap out of me the other day. - The nursing home guy? - Yes! Yes, and he kept saying that he knew me, and saying that he was sorry, and I assumed he was just confused, but-- - wait a second, you know where this guy is? - Yeah, oakmont nursing home. It's right next to our office. - Guys, no, this is good, this is really good. I've been trying to find this guy, and now, I can go talk to him. - I don't know if he'll be much help. I mean, he didn't exactly seem mentally all there. - I don't think this is a coincidence. - Yeah, it is weird. - Can I just say that the fact that my two best friends are working together and maybe also becoming best friends, it's, like, making my month. - You're so cute. - Yeah. - Well, I'm happy too 'cause, guys, honestly, I've been trying to be your third wheel since I moved here. - You're not a third wheel! - Third wheel? - You are in the group. - Now I'm glad we're friends. - Yes, friends! I told you we wouldn't finish the cheesecake. - Please, I would have eaten all mine and yours. - I know sean will appreciate the. - Dr. Burke. - awkward. - how funny it is to run into you. My brother and I were just popping in for a quick lunch. - Hi, yeah, good to see you again as well. - Good to hear. Alex has been dying to try this place, right? - yeah. - Well, you should try the cheesecake. - Okay. - actually, would you guys answer some questions for me, about the merger? - We're not giving interviews. - Until after the merger. It's a company policy, we don't talk to the press. - Right. - so if you're ever in the market for a house, ms. Allen, please let us know. yeah, well, we should get going. We have a meeting. It was good to see you again. - yeah, same. - yeah. - Enjoy the cheesecake. - I can't believe those are your brothers! - Are they following us? That is crazy. - I would be freaking out. - I know this is weird for you. You okay? - yeah, I'm okay. I think, I don't know, I have no idea. - Hey, mom, what's up? - I just want to let you know I'm heading home. - Okay, just finishing up some paperwork on this franklin deal. Hey, mom, are we doing any business with candace burke? - I don't think so. Candace burke? - Yeah, dad met with her yesterday. And then alex and I bumped into her at lunch, and she acted really strange. - Really? Weird. But I just figure she might not be worth the headache. - It doesn't sound like she is. I'll make sure to let your father know. - Okay. Mom, also, this reporter lady asked alex and me some questions about the merger. Yeah, but I told her no comment, but I was thinkin', it might be good for us to get some press. - well, it's probably best to wait till after the merger. Some of these journalist types, they try and dig up a story when there's nothing there. So, this reporter, where did you meet her? - Well, she was with candace burke. I think they were having lunch. - You were asked a question by a journalist who was having lunch with candace burke? - Yeah, about the merger. - Maybe I will have your father give her a call. Did she leave you a card? - You know, actually, she did. - you know, honey, your father and I, we would never, ever let anything bad happen to this company or to you. It is your future, and you worked really, really hard for it. - Mom, I know. Look, the merger's gonna go through. Everything's gonna be fine, okay? I promise, don't worry. - You're right. Okay, goodnight. - Goodnight. - Love you. - I love you too. - it's me. We need to know everything candace burke has on us. She's not just going away! - my god. - that's a good thing. - how did we not find anything in that boutique? - Nothing at all. - I don't know, it was kind of expensive. - No, no cute outfits. - Guys, what time is it? - Late. - Late. - All right. Seriously, thank you guys so much for all your help. - I'll let you know if I find anything. - Yes, we'll figure it out. - Hey, can I actually get that folder back? - Sure. - I'm just gonna keep adding to it, and I'll email you a copy. - Of course, I mean, it's your hard work in there, so. - okay. - Drive safe, guys. - We'll be in touch. stay still! Drop the bag. Open the car. Get in! lock the door and count to 20. - one, two, - okay, thank you, officer. Just let us know if you find anything else. All right. - What'd the police say, did they get the guy? - No, but they found your purse. And weirdly enough, everything is still in it. - What, even the cash? - Yeah. - So then why would they take my purse? - I don't know. I mean, the cops think the guy got scared and tossed it. They said it was probably a kid. I'm just so grateful that you're okay. You know, if anything ever happened to you, I don't know what I would do. - Hey, no, don't. Please don't think like that. I'm fine, nothing happened. - okay, so I know this timing might be a bit weird, but I did get you something, before today. - You got me something? - Yeah, yup. You know, it was supposed to be a, you know, a spur-of-the-moment fun present. - What? - they say you're supposed to start taking them even before you conceive. - Sean. You are... they? That's what they say? - Well, the internet, the internet says that. - Well, they are right. I'm a doctor, so I can verify this. - I just want you to have everything you need, so you're ready when the time comes. - I love you. - I love you. I also love chocolate. - This is the sweetest, and I love it. I just also love chocolate. You know, for next time. - I don't even know what I was thinkin'. - You are good, sir. What? this was the worst day ever, and you just made it so much better. - Well, get ready for it to continue getting better because I am making dinner. - You're making dinner? - Yeah. - For me? - yeah! - you know that I'm not actually pregnant yet, right? - What, can't a man make dinner for his beautiful wife? - jake. - Calvin. Max. - I'm sean, did you forget that? - I'm just thinking of names for boys. Max. I like it. What about girls' names? - I was thinkin' mildred. - You like mildred? - What, it's a classic! - No one under 90 is named mildred. - What? There are plenty of people under 90 named mildred! - Who? Name two. - We'll talk about it later. - door's open! - Hey, it's me. - Hey! - the old battle ax here to ruin your day off. - No, never! I love a good fashion show. - This, my darling, could be a fashion nightmare. You know me. I don't know what to wear to marybeth's retirement party. I need your help, and I got you lattes. - Thank you so much. I have so much work to do today. - I know, sean told me. - Thank you, thank you. - You look beautiful. - Hey, how is marybeth, by the way? I had no idea she was even retiring. - I didn't tell you that she had breast cancer? - What? - Yeah. - No, that's terrible! - I know, it's been awful. you know, marybeth, she never wanted to go to the doctor. She never wanted to get a physical. Then her mother gets diagnosed, if you can believe it, with breast cancer in August, so she says, you know, maybe I should go in, get myself checked out, and sure enough, she's got it. - Fortunately, the doctors caught it early enough. They said it's a good prognosis. They're not even recommending chemotherapy, or anything like that, fingers crossed. - Thank god. I mean, unfortunately, I hear stories like this all the time, and it makes me crazy when patients don't get regular check-ups. - I know, she wouldn't have even gotten herself checked out if it wasn't for her mom. But you know, she's thankin' the whole genetics thing. - Yes, exactly. Exactly, this is why I'm trying so hard to find my family history. I want to make sure that I am not passing anything on to our future child when the time comes. - You know, sean told me about your birth father. - what a jerk! You know, I never liked those stupid tv commercials he did, and now I know why. 'cause he's a jerk! - Yeah, it didn't exactly go how I thought it would. - Listen to me, don't let that man get in the way of what you want to know. You deserve better. If he keeps stonewalling you, you come to me. I'll kick him in the gut, you got it? - I got it. - and gladly. seriously. - I know you will. - So what's the verdict? you hate it? - I love it, you look great! - I look like a marshmallow. - No! No, it's just because it's white. - Yeah, can you wear white to another woman's retirement party? - Yeah, I think so. I mean, it's not her wedding day. - You know I've done that? I wore white to my cousin sharon's wedding, because I hate my cousin sharon. - no, you didn't. - Yes, I did. I'm a spitfire, what can I say? You know sean gets that from me. - Don't I know? - all right, mr. Rossman. You need to get your rest. get yourself all worked up. - My body may be going, but I still have my wits about me. - I know, mr. Rossman. I know. Goodnight. - hey. - Hey! - you headin' out for the day? - Yeah, I had an appointment cancel and sean has to work late, so I think margot's gonna come over-- - whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what? I said I wanted you two to be friends, but with me in the center. You can't have an oreo without the filling. - We are not hanging out without you. Margot pulled some records from mayfield county, and she needs help sorting them, and let's face it, I really like to sort. - yeah, that's weird, candace. - No, I just want to help. And who knows, maybe we'll find, like, my original birth certificate or official adoption records? - Okay, well, fine. I will help you two nerds go through pages of bureaucracy. - I thought you had a little date tonight. - Please, I always have a date. I can reschedule my barely-swiped-right-guy for the night. I'll be there at eight with thai. - Cream cheese wontons for me, please. - yes. - delivery guy was cute. - they're all cute. - shut up! - listen up, ladies, this doesn't make any sense. I mean, I checked all of the records from around my birthdate, and there is nothing about a birth or an adoption. I mean, nothing linked to the masons whatsoever. - God, everything they've done is legit. I'm serious, look at this. They paid their taxes, they have filed every permit that you ever need to build a house. I don't know. - you guys, I feel like this is pointless. I mean, maybe I should find some other way to get my family medical history. - You cannot give up this quickly. I promise you, this is how all stories start, okay? Yeah, I mean, there's hopelessness, but usually, right after that is when you find your big break. We're going to figure this out. We're gonna find this, it just may take a little while. - Okay. - See, like, right now, with allie's phone, that's a big break. Wait, no, I think it's just a booty call. - It's definitely a booty call. - it's sean. - My sean? - Yeah, you're not answering your phone, you big dummy. His words, not mine. - Man, I actually have not seen my phone in a minute. Do you think I left it at work? - Yeah, I saw it on the counter in the break room, but I thought you grabbed it. - No! I don't think I did. Shoot, I need to go get it. - Well, you can get it tomorrow. - No, no, it has all of my notes on the blakemore twins, and I have to upload them tonight. - Well, it's pretty late. Do you want a ride? - No, no, no, guys, it's my fault. Sit, enjoy your wine, relax. - If we're not gonna do this, I think I'm actually gonna call it a night too, ladies. - Well, in that case, I'm gonna see if it's not too late for that bad date. - how? You literally just canceled on him. What, you think he's sittin' at home waitin' for you to call him? - Yeah. They always are. - They are, yeah. - Touche. - And I'm meeting him in 10. - Wow. - Okay. - Wow, just like that. - I am thoroughly impressed. - I'm also, like, proud too. - You proud? - Date for me and her. - I do okay, though, I do okay. Be happy for me, girls. - do you have a picture of this one? - I do, actually, look. - let me see, let me see. - duh, candace. What are you doing? you're fine, you're fine. hank you so much. This feels so good! - I'm adding masseuse to the resume. hey, do you think it's possible someone was actually there? - No, I don't. I think I was silly and I got spooked. - Candace, I want you to find your parents, you know I do, but I'm worried that it's starting to take a toll on you. - Sean. - I'm just worried that you're getting all wrapped up in something that isn't even-- - no, I'm not, I'm not getting wrapped up. I mean, you should have seen the way tom treated me when we talked, and how his sons acted at the restaurant? They were trying to intimidate me. - I know, and I just want what's best for you, that's all. I mean, you're just so, I'll tell you what. Just to be safe, let's call the police tomorrow morning. - No, we don't, we do not have to do that. - Candace, if there's even a 1% chance someone broke into your office, we should be sure. I'll come with you, okay? - Yeah, okay. - All right, now let's get those knots out. - Okay. Okay, this is not, no, not nice. - All right, here we go! - hey, stop! Okay, I'm gettin' you back. it just didn't feel right, detective frasier. and nothing was taken? - No, not that I can find, but things were moved around on my desk. - Is there a cleaning staff? - Yes, there is. - Tell him about your computer, and the file on the masons. - Allie. - What? He's the most likely suspect, as far as I'm concerned. - Okay, okay. Recently, I found out that tom and jeanette mason are my biological parents, and I had a file on the computer that just had some information on them, and, look, I don't know how to explain this, but someone was going through my computer. It was not like this when I left. - Tom mason of mason real estate? - Yeah. - That's who you think broke into your office? - It's possible. Right, it's-- - look, there are no signs of forced entry here, okay? There are no missing objects. My suggestion would be to invest in a security camera. They're cheaper than ever nowadays. - I've been telling her that for years. - That way, if you have another incident like this, we can catch the person. - What about the masons? You're just not gonna follow up? - I think it's highly unlikely that someone of mr. Mason's stature would do something like this, but it doesn't hurt to check into it, just to be safe. - Thank you, officer, I'll walk you out. - ladies. - Thank you. - No. - I don't know. - No. - I don't know anything anymore. I mean, it could have been the cleaning people. - absolutely not. - okay, get 'em. - hey, hon, I'm headed out. - I'll be right back. - cameras are up, the tech's just checking them now. - thanks, babe. - yeah, I think you're right. - You sure you're gonna be okay? Why don't you take the rest of the day off? - No, I'm fine. I have patients all day, I'll be distracted. - Call me if you need anything, anything at all. - I will. All right, let's stack all these ones. Yup, whoa, whoa! Yeah, I know that, but I'm telling you, margot, they had to be after those files. I mean, first the mugging, now this? - you're gonna be fine. - that's not it, okay? If they came after me, they are definitely coming after you. Just, please, be careful and watch your back, okay? - Trust me, I'll be fine. I gotta go. Excuse me. Hi, I was wondering if I could speak to one of your residents, felix rossner. - I'm so sorry to tell you this. Felix passed away earlier this week. - Really? When, exactly? - I'm sorry, are you a family member? - I'm not. Margot allen, I'm a reporter for the times. So, can you tell me anything about the cause of death? - No, I'm sorry, I can't. - Right. And I'm guessing you won't let me peek at that visitor's log from the day he died? - No, I'm sorry. - Okay. Ma'am! Access to that security footage, it's a definite no? Right, okay. Look, can I just talk to some of the residents that knew felix? My editor wants to do a human interest story. I mean, he was born here and he's lived here his whole life. I just think it would honor him. - okay. The media room's that way. You have one hour to interview anyone who's in there, but after that, I really think you need to be going. - No, that's great, thank you. - hello? Yes, you told me to notify you if anyone was asking after mr. Rossman. - No, of course. Yes, thank you for checking in. I just want to preserve his memory, that's all. - Which is why we need to get this thing signed as soon as possible. It is a big deal, george. You aren't gettin' cold feet, are ya? okay, all right. All right, listen, I'm runnin' late for a meeting. okay. Yeah, you got it. All right, george, I'll talk to you later then. Call me any time, bye. Yes? - Enough is enough, tom. Candace burke, she's getting too close. - I'm on top of it, jeanette. - You're on top of it? First, you botch the mugging. - That wasn't my fault. We had to find out what was in that file. - And then you break into her office and you get the police involved! - That was worth it. There's nothing in that file to worry about. It's just a bunch of illegally obtained dna results and a background that anyone with a server could find. - Tom. - Jeanette, look, I talked to the police. They don't think we're involved. They think she's crazy. Chief carver actually apologized to me for any inconvenience. This is nothing. - Well, I disagree. - Well. - I just got a call from oakmont nursing home. A reporter was there asking about felix. - dammit! - So you agree, we need to do something for real this time! - jeanette! We meet with the board of trustees next week. We can't afford any more delays-- - I told you, don't push me! Dammit! - hey, hey, hey. - Stop, I think I can walk to the car myself. It's still daylight. - I'd just feel a lot safer if you had an escort. - I'm okay, really. - So is the plan still to leave from your house? - Wait, what? - Is sean okay with me leaving my car at your place? - Leaving, what are you talking about? - The conference in vegas on infectious diseases? - Wait, that's this weekend? - Yeah. - No, I completely forgot! - I don't blame you, you have a lot going on. - Wow, I am losing it, al. I am usually so on top of these things, I'm sorry. - I know. - See, this is why I shouldn't even go. I mean, I am so overwhelmed right now, al. - But that is exactly why you have to come. - No, allie-- - the conference is going to have multiple open bars. Come on! Open bar plus hot tub, plus open bar again? You need this. - Okay, fine, but I don't want to talk about anything, not the masons or my adoption. - I won't mention it if you don't. - And I want to skip out on all the lectures early. - Why go at all? Have you seen the hotel we're staying at? It's crazy swanky! mani-pedis, room service. - Yes, room service! Can we order fries and bread? And just all of the carbs, please! - We're gonna eat every damn carb. - Yes, thank you! - Just you and moi in hotel luxury on the company dime. - My gosh, get out of here. - on the company dime! - I will see you soon. all right, I'm starting to feel better about you forcing me to come here. - I knew you would. - I mean, this hotel is so fancy. - I know, right? All right, last chance. Let's skip the seminar and go straight for the pool. - No, we cannot do that. And I should probably go put on more, like, work-ish clothes, or at least my blazer. - Or we could be the doctors who wore cute dresses to the seminar so then everyone will know that we're ready to party. - I don't know if I'm ready to party yet. - Are you kidding? You were born to party. Bam! - What is that? - Put it on. - Absolutely not! - Fine, fine, you'll try it on later. Just put it in your purse. - How about we start - hi, candace burke. - Allie watts. Thank you. - that whole lecture on microbiology, it was incredible! - yeah, it was really good. He kept me entertained. - That was so fascinating. I mean, it's gonna completely change how I address flu shots with my patients. - Yeah, yeah, it was fine. But now that the speeches are over, the night is on. - Okay, well, let me just check in with sean real fast. He called me, like, three times. - No, I need back up. Look at all those fine mds. - I feel like you will be fine without me. Excuse me. - Hi. - She's married, I'm not. I'm allie. - I'm al. - I see you, I see you. Get it! - Yeah! - was so cute! - I know! - no, it closes at 10! Boo, I wanted to swim. - We still can, girl. - No, allie, it's closed. - it's open, actually. - No! No, but we're gonna get caught! - So? We're hotel guests. Hotel guests sneak into pools all the time. it's what we do. - You're so cool when you're being a rebel. - I love living on the edge, girl. - it's too cold. I'm glad you talked me into this. this was worth the break-in. - yes, it was. - I don't even care if we get busted now. - Okay, so tell me, now that I'm boring and married, best night of your life with a guy, go. - The vending machine guy. - no! - I swear. - The best night of your life was with the vending machine guy? - Yeah. he was hot. - I know he's hot, but the vending machine guy? - Yes! I should call him. - add him to the list. - whatever. Well, don't knock it until you try it! - okay, I know we, like, literally just got in, but it is so late, and I'm tired, and I-- - no! - I know, I know, but I'm beat, and I'm kinda drunk, and I need to be able to function tomorrow. - Right, more lectures on boring team procedures and best practices, yawn. - I mean, that's kind of what we came here for. - I came here for this pool, and I am going to stay in it a little longer. - Are you sure, by yourself? - Yeah. who knows, maybe some handsome stranger might find me down here and join me for a bit? - I mean, I did see a vending machine inside, so you'll probably get lucky! fine, suit yourself! I guess the party is over for me, so. Goodnight, my love. I hope a handsome swimmer. - fingers crossed! - here you go, party animal. - thanks. - I know. I thought I did handle it! It was dark, okay? All I could see were the lights on that stupid hat. - I don't want your excuses. I'm paying you to get it done, so do it. Thank you. - I told you, I told you something was wrong, and I told you someone was following me, and now allie-- I'll get on a flight right away. - I don't know. I don't know, I mean, I just assumed she didn't come back last night because she met someone. - I know this is a lot to take in right now, but if there's anything you can tell us about allie. Did she have any enemies? - No. - Any scorned lovers? - No, no, everyone loved allie. I don't know, I don't know why anyone would kill her. Please, just find who did this to her. - where have you been, margot? We're on a deadline! - so I just left the coroner's office on the rossman story. He was definitely murdered, okay? This is a cover-up, I don't care what they say. So I'm jumpin' on this ferry and I'll be back at the office in an hour. - hey, it's candace burke. Leave a message after the beep. - hey, girl, it's margot. So, I just wanted to tell you that I finally went to go see felix rossman today, and he's dead. So, I don't know, the coroner said that it was of natural causes, and the nurse wouldn't give me any details, but I don't know, man. This just feels, there's something off. So can you... sorry, thought I saw something. Anyways, I'll give you the details when we talk, so just call me whenever you can, okay? Okay, bye. are you serious? what the hell do you want? Jerk, stop! wait! jerk! come on! hi, this is margot. Pretty sure you know how voicemail works. - Hey, it's me, please call me back when you get this. I am really starting to worry about you. - Hey! I thought you might like a-- - no, I'm good, thanks. - Are you sure, 'cause you don't seem good. - Margot called me, like, four times. She never calls me like that unless it's important. And she left me this. - I was looking into the people that used to work at mason real estate way back in the day when they first got started. There was this intern named henrietta. She was fired, like, really suddenly. I think there's something more to this, so give me a call as soon as you get this, okay? All right, bye. - Well, what do you think she found out? - I have no idea. But I've called her 10 times and she hasn't called me back yet. - Okay, well, maybe her phone's off, or she's busy? - No, sean, you don't understand. Margot always has her phone with her, and she compulsively calls people back. Something's wrong, I know it, and I have to find out what it is. - wait, wait, wait, hold on a second. Where are you going? - Out! - Okay, where? - Margot was onto something, and the closer we've gotten to the truth, the more bad things have happened. There's something about my past and my parents that someone doesn't want me to know. Well, too bad. - Candace. - I'm not crazy, sean! Yes, sure, this may all be a coincidence, but margot taught me to trust my instincts, and my instincts are telling me the masons are behind all of this somehow. - What if you-- - no, first allie, now margot? This all has to do with my adoption and-- - hey, hey, hey! I'm not calling you crazy. I just know that you're upset, and I don't want you to do anything rash or illegal. I'm worried too, you know? - okay, yes, I know, I know, and I was just planning on going to the office. - Okay. - There's a file there that margot made for me, and I think that something inside will help me piece all this together. - Okay, all right. I can go with you if you want. - No, no, no, no, no, stay here. I gotta get outta here for a little bit and clear my head. I just gotta do this alone. - All right. I'm not gonna discuss this with you? - tom! Tom! No, wait! stop it. This is a bigger problem. This is a bigger problem-- - what would you like me to do? Tell me what you want me to do. - henrietta. - I just don't want to keep re-hashing the past! You keep digging this up and throwing it in my face every time you want to manipulate me about something, and I don't want to do it anymore! I don't want to go through it! - Will you please lower your voice? I need you to remain as calm as possible because yelling and screaming isn't gonna help anyone. There's only one thing that will help right now. - what are you doing? Put that away, we're not killin' anybody. - Tom, what I need is for you to finally take responsibility for what you did-- - here we go. - And fix your mistake! You, not me, because god knows I didn't get our 21-year-old secretary pregnant-- - how many times do you want me to apologize? - That was you! - That was 30 years ago! - You're right! 30 years ago, we built this company on our reputation! We were wholesome, a family-owned company that sold homes to other wholesome families! We were on the cusp of a million-dollar loan when you-- - I know, jeanette. - And your affair almost ruined everything. - You never let me forget. - We fixed it, didn't we? We killed henrietta so the truth of your affair would never come out, but we should have killed candace too. It was against my better judgment not to. You were just too attached. Well, I'm not gonna make that mistake again. - Why do we have to kill her? She's my daughter, for christ's sake! - She's a liability. We are on the eve of the biggest merger this company has ever seen, and once again, your infidelity has come back to haunt us. We can't just send candace away again. She's a real problem. If people find out about your affair and the cover-up, and everything we did, we are ruined, our business, our family, our lives. Is that what you want? - I don't know. - sweetheart, this merger is everything. The company, it's the legacy we leave behind, the gift we give to our boys. Felix and that reporter, they had to be taken care of. - what do you mean taken care of? Jeanette? What did you do? What did you do? - I did what had to be done. - Felix? He worked for us for years! He was our most loyal employee! - He was senile, he was bound to talk. It was only a matter of time before he told a nurse or that reporter everything we did! - I told you, I was gonna handle that. - How? By sneaking around in candace's office, or that botched mugging? We tried it your way, and she's not giving up. We need to kill her! Scaring her isn't enough, tom! It's not enough. - we're not murderers, jeanette. We can't be murderers. - We are anything we need to be to protect our family. You killed henrietta to protect our family, and you will do it again. Tom! You're going to kill your daughter. - hi, it's sean burke. I'm just trying to reach candace. If she shows up at the office, could you have her call me? Thanks. - hey, it's candace burke. Leave a message after the beep. - Candace, it's me again. I'm just worried. Call me back, please. - it's time. This loose end has been in our lives for too long. - How can you ask me to kill my own daughter? She's my family, for god's sake. - She is not your family. Alex is your family! Bruce is your family! I am your family! And it is time for you to finally do the right thing for your family! - No. I won't do it. - where's candace? - Who are you? Wait. Wait, you're tom mason, right? - Yes. - How do you have the nerve to even show up here after what you've done? - Look, I don't have time to get into this with you right now. Is she here? - Well, you better try! You know, she spent the past few weeks trying to prove to everyone that you were her father. You did a pretty good job making her think she was crazy, but she was right, wasn't she? She was right. - Yes, she was right, I'm her father, but now she's in danger! Is she here? - What do you mean she's in danger? What'd you do to her? - Nothing! Listen to me, if my wife finds her before we do, she will kill her, do you understand that? Now, you have to think, where could she be? Think! - I don't know! I don't know, okay? I was gonna try your office in mayfield, but she-- - wait, wait, wait, my office? I was just there. god, jeanette's still there. We gotta go, now! - aw! She's awake! Well, well, well. You woke up from your little nap? You know, I am not as young as I used to be. Getting you up here was a real challenge. I have always hated this place. tom wanted to buy it. I thought he just loves the woods. I didn't realize he made it a place to take his filthy, well, your mother. when I told tom to kill your mother years ago, he did it here. He was worried about getting caught as any sane person would be, but I promised him that no one would ever find out, and I was right. No one ever did. I never thought I would be capable of doing such things, but being a mother, it changes you in so many ways. I don't expect you to understand that, but it really does. The lengths a mother will go to protect her family, it's almost primal. well, back to work. - I coulda sworn she was headed here. - Something's not right. - Candace is tough and smart. She wouldn't let some middle-aged woman just take advantage of her. - Yeah, well, you don't know my wife. She could be very dangerous. What is that? - it's candace's earring. - You sure? - She wears 'em every day. - that means jeanette has her. - where is she? Where would she have taken her? - I don't know. Could be anywhere. She has access to over a dozen properties in the mayfield area alone. - mom? - who is that? - That's my son. Bruce! bruce. - Hey! - Have you seen your mother anywhere? - No, I thought she was here. I'm supposed to give a tour of the marley estate, but she's not returning my calls. - Do you know where she is? - No! what's going on? You and mom have been acting so strange lately. Are you in some kinda trouble? - Yeah, son, yeah, we are. - Dad, does this have anything to do with candace burke? - What do you know about her? - Nothing. I told mom that I ran into her at a restaurant, and mom thought she might be a threat. - Listen to me, this is important. Do you have any idea at all where she could be? - No. dad, this is crazy. You think mom might actually kidnap someone? - Believe me, you have no idea what she's capable of. I need your help, son. Could she be at the buckman house, or the loft on main street? - I don't know, I'm sorry. - It's all right. she pick up? - She's not answering. I don't-- - sean? - Candace? - Sean! - Candace! - Sean, sean, it's jeanette. She has me, she's trying to kill me. Please, you have to call the police. - Where are you? - I don't know. I don't know, I don't know where I am! - I need you to describe where you are. - I don't know, okay? I look outside, and I just see a bunch of trees. All I see are trees, I don't know! - Okay, can you give me anything else? Is there a sign, anything? Can you see anything out the window? - No, it looks like we're in the middle of nowhere, sean. It just looks like the woods. - Okay, baby, please, I know that you're scared, but you're the bravest woman I've ever met. I need you to look out the window and tell me what you see. - okay. I'm looking outside and I don't see anything. - candace! - what? - The line went dead. - you can scream if you want to! There isn't a neighbor for miles! You just couldn't mind your own business. Neither could your stupid friends! I'm sure you miss 'em! Well, that's okay! You're gonna see them real soon. It's over, candace. - now it's over. That's for felix, and for allie, and for margot. - your wife turned up on the security footage from the hotel. I had my officers take a look at her known addresses. We were on our way to your house in blakemore when you called. - Well, thank god you got here in time. I just wish I woulda thought of this place sooner. She told me she sold it years ago, but I guess she didn't want to let it go. - Well, I'm glad that you thought of it. Your call probably saved her life. - Is there anything else I can do, or? - Well, actually, we're gonna need all of you to come down to the station for questioning. - Okay. - Especially you, tom. You might want to call a lawyer. - Yeah, I understand. Can I have a few minutes with them? - of course. - I appreciate it. It seems like they have some more questions for us, and I imagine I'm probably in a bit of legal trouble myself. There's a lot I'd like to say to you, so if you're ready to go, I'd love for you to ride in with me. - Ride with you? I will never go anywhere with you, ever. - Candace. He was the one that told the police where you were. I mean, he saved your life, he-- - no, sean, he did not save my life. He knew that jeanette killed allie and margot, and she told me that you killed my mother here. - That's not, look, I've made a lot of mistakes, and I have a lot to answer for, but I did not know jeanette had killed your friends until a few hours ago. And if I'd known she was sending someone to your hotel room that night, I woulda stopped her. I didn't know, and I'll have to live with that for the rest of my life. As for your mother, jeanette wanted me to kill her. She thought it was the only way that we could protect our business, our brand, and her distorted version of a family, but I couldn't do it. I couldn't. - Are you saying my mother's alive? - Yes, she is. When I brought her here to the lake house that night, jeanette had given me a gun and told me to take care of her. I couldn't. Henrietta was the only woman that I ever truly loved. My partner, felix, and I, we drove her to the canadian border. He had a friend who could get her a new passport. I gave her $30,000 in cash and told her to start a new life. It killed her to be separated from you, but we didn't have a choice, and we thought you'd be safer if you never knew. Candace, she was just a kid. I mean, she had no family, no money, no way to fight jeanette, who was already a very powerful woman in mayfield. And I, I was too weak to stop any of it, too ashamed, too... anyway, I just needed her to be safe. If jeanette found out she was alive-- - yeah. - Listen to me. We never stopped talking. Your mother says my fear is our only roadblock. It's true, but I can tell her it's safe to come home now. You deserve to know henrietta. My god, the two of you are so much alike, it scares me. - sorry, everyone, but we really need to vacate the property. - Yeah, yeah. - She might be alive. - I know, I know. It's okay. Everything's gonna be okay. - hey, that's beautiful! - Looks great. - Not so bad, is it? - the door, I gotta get that. - Did I mention that I made it myself? - once or twice. - allow me to mention it again, I made it. - henrietta, I'm so glad you made it! - So are tom and henrietta, like, an item now? - Yes. - You're gettin' bigger every time I see you, candace. - I know, I can't see my-- - I know, it's bizarre, but he did the six months in prison. He's got another six in house arrest. - That's it, just six months? - Well, he gave the authorities all kinds of evidence on jeanette, so. - Well, I guess he did the right thin in the end, didn't he? - Guys, look who made it! - henrietta! - Nice to see you-- - henrietta! - Again, trudy. - Hello. - she brought cookies. - More sugar, excellent. - Yay. - Tom's sorry that he couldn't make it, by the way. - It's okay, next time. - I'm so proud of you, buddy. - It's been a while since you said that to me. - Thank you again for including me today. - Of course! - You don't know how hard it was for me not to have contact with you. It haunts me. - You thought we were in danger. You saved us. I could never be mad at you. - Thank you, sweetie. - I'm so sorry to interrupt, but cake? yes! - one for my lovely wife. - it's beautiful. - Mom. - Why don't you let me take a shot at the slicing portion of the-- - okay, good, I am no precision surgeon. - would somebody please pop this balloon so that we can find out what we're having? - Are we ready for this? Okay, let's find out, let's do it! You are doing the honors. Okay, ready? - Three, two, one! - Two, one! - it's a girl! You hear that? we're having a girl! - now we know it's for real now. - come here! - Aw, come here, son! - congratulations. - That's right, gramps, how's that feel? - Feels good!
