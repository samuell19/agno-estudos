[sobbing] - I lost it. - Hey, what's the matter? - I lost my bracelet. - Okay, um, just give me a minute. I'll check for you. - Are you looking for something? - Yeah, a lady's bracelet. - Could it be this? Whoa. - Hey, give me that. - This is quite the piece. - Someone lost that. - Is that who's on the phone? - Yeah. - Ask them if there's a reward. - Fine. Hey, I'm sorry, but is there a reward? - I have to get that bracelet back. I'll be in so much trouble. Um, listen, I'll give you $500 cash, alright? - Um, it's here. - Oh thank you. Thank you so much. You are a prince. - It's a $50 reward. - Really? - Yeah. - I'm surprised. Huh... Thanks for the drink. - Hey, it's her birthday! Come on, she's a real nice lady. I'll give you $250. - Ha! You are quite the gentleman. I'll take the cash first, if you don't mind. Honour always seems to be among thieves these days. [sighing] [cash register beeping] - She must be something else. - She is. You have no idea. [man]: Nice work, kid. - You shone, baby. Your father will be so proud of you. Do your math. - $250. And what about the change from the 100? - That's my pocket money. [laughing] - But the $100 wasn't real. It came from the kit. - You're so smart! Look at this kid, Freddy. You're always a step ahead. - With a little practice, you could pull some zingers. - Oh, don't get any ideas. - I'm a chip off the old block. - Well, make sure you cover your tracks better than he did. - She was referring to me. Right? - Right, Mom. - Pleasure doing business with you, ladies. - The pleasure is mine. - Do yourself a favour to remember this arrangement is temporary. - This arrangement could take us places. It's perfect. Nobody would suspect her. - I had a good time. - It's temporary. He'll be back. - Until he gets back, I have the privilege of your charming company and your unrivaled artistry. - I'll call you when I need you. - Alright. [door closing, locking] $250. Fast Freddy's got nothing on your father. Sam could get $500 without even smiling. - That's 'cause he's a pro. - Yeah... - I wish he was here. - If he were, you wouldn't be. - When do I get my cut? - When you're 16, my sweet. Two years less three months. Everything will happen then. Your father will be out, we'll be a family again and you'll be ready for, anything just like me. I'd die if anything ever happened to you. - Me too. - I won't go without you. - We go together.

That's the only mistake your Dad ever made. Couldn't work in anything else but his favourite suit. Said it was lucky... till it wasn't. Well, not me. I'd wear a different dress every day if I can. They feel new, you know? - Can't we just be normal? How much money did you take? - Listen to you! What are you? The police? Anyway, I only paid for some of it. If you were there to help, it'd be easier to lift, right? You like it? We have to dress for success. We are career girls now, right? Yeah. - Let's go to work, then. - Mm-hmm. The more we make it, the more we take. - I'll call Freddy. - No. Don't call him. He's really rubbing me the wrong way. Let's stay in and have fun instead. Yeah? Hmm? - We could use the cash. - Do you know how lucky we are to be artists? You don't have to go to school with a bunch of squares. I don't have to go to an office with a bunch of stiffs.

Why don't I go to bed and you can calm down on Drew? - What? - It's a little overplayed, but at last, you see my superior skills. - You're right. You win. Again and always. - Sammie! Don't go! I love you. [barking, hooting] [clattering] [grunting, sobbing] - Anyone who tells you they love you is just holding you hostage. - Don't do anything crazy. - I used to be a bartender. - Now, what are you? [glass shattering] [sighing] - Seems I fucked up again. - What now? - Options are limited. [sighing] You want to pull the plug? - That's the difference between you and me, Marlene. I could get used to living. I just need some peace and quiet, to think. - What? And a friend? Why do you need that? - He's nice. - And I've been sitting here all alone. - You've never been alone. It would kill you. - Yep. It would. - Dad isn't coming, and Jesus isn't working. - No. Neither nor. - You think you can save us now? - Don't count me out, sweetheart. I'm not dead yet. [rock music] - You shouldn't have worn that dress. This is a conservative gig. - Shh... It's my lucky dress, baby. Do you want to win? [Freddy]: Good evening. [whistling] [car door closing] - Would you like to donate to our field trip?

Thank you for your generous donation. - So where are you going on your field trip? - We're going to the women's penitentiary. - How darling. What a sweet girl you have. - There we go. [whispering]: Come on! Hurry! [beeping] Oh! Oh my God. [laughing] Wow. [clock ringing] [typing] - Eureka. Okay, I'm going to take the office, you find the bedrooms. Don't dilly dally. - Oh my God. - What are you doing? - Baby. - No lights, Marlene! - Oh, there you are! I want to see the sparkles. - Mom, don't act crazy. Not now. - Oh, baby! Oh! Can you ever forgive me? This is it. This is the treasure we were meant for. This is where we fit. We'll have a fresh start. - Please keep it together. We have to get out. - Don't take them. I want to enjoy myself, for a change. Look at me. Oh! Let's not sell them. They suit me, don't you think? - Marlene, we have to get going. - Spending the night in those sparkly things. - Jesus, Mom. Come on. - Don't rush me. I'm spending the night. I wonder what that fine man would do if he could find me here, all curled up in this bed, waiting for him, ready to pounce on his rich, well-manicured... - Hey what are you doing? Get off the bed, we gotta go. - I'm not going anywhere, Freddy. I was made for this bed. I was made for this house. Let me go! - You're getting sloppy, Marlene. Why are the lights on? - Let me go! [doorbell ringing] - Come on. - I'm not going. - Mom! - We gotta go, now! Look, you gotta take Sammie, get outta here. - I want to stay here with this man. - He doesn't want you here! - Can't you see it, Freddy? I will be everything he dreams about. Yes. - For God's sake, you can't stay here. - He will love me. [knocking on door] He will love me!!! - This is the police! Open the door! [mumbling] - Mom, we have to get out. [Marlene crying] Please, Mom. Please. We have to get going, okay? We have to go right now. - Get my shoes. Come on. Come on! Run! Jesus, girl, you're killing me. Come on. Let's go. - You go. - I'm not leaving you. - Yes, you are. [indistinct radio chatter] [car door closing] You already have. [police siren] [car starting] [rock music] ♪ Step on a crack ♪ Break your mother's back ♪ Step on rocks ♪ Step behind logs ♪ Step on a nail ♪ Put your father in jail ♪ - Hello, Sammie. You give any more thought to helping your mother out? [phone ringing] - Hello? - Samantha Bell? - Yes? - This is Sergeant Morris. - He made me panic. - Give me some of that. [screaming] [engine revving] [thudding] - He made me panic. - Pardon me? - Nothing. What's happening? - We have your sister here. - Sister? - Marlene Bell? - Shit. - Miss Bell? - Yeah? - Bring her some clothes if you can. [soft music] [Marlene]: You are a prince! You know that? You're so cute. You remind me of my first boyfriend. [Marlene laughing] Oh, is that your car? - No. It's my dad's. - Oh, it's shiny. I should meet your dad. Baby! Hey! I've been all over town. Sweetheart... Stay out of the sun, you're gonna fade. [laughs] Oops, I'm in trouble. It's alright, I'm used to it. - Watch your head. - That's okay... I'm okay. [chuckles] You doll. Should marry him. [laughs] - Keys. - Oh, yeah. - You could come stay with us, sleep in my brother's old bed. [scoffing] - Yeah, right. - I'm gonna ask my mom. - She thinks I'm a bad apple. - Because she doesn't know you. - Probably better that way. - Don't you have, like, a social work type person, because of the welfare? - No. I mean, yeah, some chick came nosing around last year to make sure we weren't rich, but... - So why don't you call her? - No. Thanks, though. - Everything's going to be okay. - Yeah. - I'm gonna talk to my mom. She won't mind. - I don't want another mother. - You're the only thing I'm proud of. - Good night, Marlene. - Good night, sweet prince. [door creaking] - Good night, Sammie. - Bye. Thanks for everything. How did you end up on Broadway and Main in a sleeping bag, Mom? [chuckling] - Some guy, whatever. Last hurrah. - What were you thinking? We need to go! - I need a little tiny lie down first, okay? Look at me. I used to be a force of nature. Now even your sweet Jesus won't touch me with a 10-foot pole. Too bad, he's a handsome bastard. Now... do me a little favour, will you? - No. Mom, I need you. - You'll be fine. You're a smart cookie. Get me my happy pills. - Please, Mom. - Please, Samantha. [deep breath] [water pouring] [turning off faucet] If it weren't for you, I'd be dead, you know? - I'm sorry. - Give me the water. - I can't. - Yes, you can. Have I raised you without skills? No? [sighing] Thank you. You're my angel. Now let me down, baby. I can't bear to wake up and put in one more goddamn stinking day. Okay? Mano a mano. [groaning] [whispering]: How did we get this way? - What's wrong? - Nothing. - Where's Sammy? - I'm right here. - No. Big Sammy. Your father. - He's not here, Mom. - No... He's here. I want to catch some Zs. [crying] [soft music] [clock ticking] [Firecracker, by Frazey Ford] [soft music]
