[somber opera singing] [orchestral music] [whistling winds] [engine chugging] [didgeridoo droning] [ethereal music] [didgeridoo droning] [flames crackling] [muffled voice] - 103. No, I tell a lie. It's 107, and the air condition is rooted. Welcome to purgatory south. - [Voiceover] I know it well. - Cogs called anyway. [muffled voice] - I have a picture here, it's Ben, Benjamin Franklin. That's Ben and that's me. - The real problem is, Mrs. Strehlov-- - Strehlow. Miss Strehlow. - We don't do this, we're not the people to help you, I mean our equipment here is meant-- - For registering footsteps? - Well, yeah but-- - Footsteps could make it an easy job. My Ben he's out there in the tunnel, in the darkness, and you've got the equipment to find him. [wind whistling] - [Voiceover] Look, mein Captain, okay? - Yeah, skol. - Um. - Perhaps you would show this young man the photo. - Why thank you, madam. I haven't been called young in a long time. - [Seated Man] She's lost her dog. - Really? - [Older Woman] Ben is just four years old. - Four? - So when Mr. Franklin, God rest his soul, brought me the two puppies, he said, "Which do you prefer, Lizzie or Ben?" And I, without a moment's hesitation, I said, the little brown one. Oh, he was so cute, and funny! - It's true, our instruments are very sensitive, they can pick up the tiniest movement, footsteps, anything. But they have to occur right next to the measurement probe. - [Voiceover] Then you can find him. - It's possible, but we'd have to bore probes in the whole mining area. That'd mean at least five thousand borings. - My Ben, he's lost out there in the tunnel. The darkness. [didgeridoo thrumming] [wind whistling] [car door slamming] - We're gonna be blasting again soon, you gotta move. Boom, boom, quick quick, understand? You've never been here before, why all of a sudden you, Just what are you doing here anyway, eh? [speaking foreign language] - We are keeping watch. This place. [engines rumbling] [knocking] - Come in. - One two five two ready to go, Mr. Hackett. - Be ready, let's do it now, okay? - Right. - Anything wrong? - The boys would like to wish you luck. - [Hackett] Thanks, Laurie. - After all the trouble you had with the company getting approval to do the test out here, where you said, it's good to see it happen. - Come in, Carl, over. - [Voiceover] I'm here, mine Commandant. - Get the boys back. Tell them with any luck there'll be champagne in buckets for everyone tonight. 'Cause I'm laying five to one, and I'm not a betting man, that they'll go off their brains at headquarters when they see what we're sitting on out here, okay? - [Voiceover] Everything okay here, waiting for the Gulliver, over. - Signal. Test on. Running. 30 seconds. [speaking foreign language] [explosions booming] - [Overalls Man] Get outta there, get back, get out, there's a cable, get the bloody cable out! - What's happening out there, the impulse has gone dead. - [Voiceover] What the fuck do you think's happening? They've cut the cable, I swear to Christ they did. - They've cut the cable? - Come on out, those fuckers have gone crazy. - What's going on here? Can anyone tell me why someone ran into the middle of our test? [speaking foreign language] - What's he saying? - There will be no digging and there'll be no blasting. - Oh, I see. And may I ever so politely ask why? - This is the place where the green ants dream. - Ants? Green ants? Dreaming, here? - Cole-- - Why the fuck can't they dream somewhere else? - Cole, calm down! Get someone to check the ignition cable. I'll see if I can contact headquarters. Calling headquarters, calling headquarters, this is Mentabi test two five two. - [Voiceover] Lance, is that you? Lincoln here. - Hello, kid, look, is Ferguson there? I've gotta speak with him. - [Voiceover] No, look, he's in Sidney, he's on a break. - Tell him to contact the legal department. Say it's like what happened in Eri-coon when those blokes went berserk on that test site. We're gonna need the best legal advice. Hang on, hang on. [engine rumbling] Tell him to come up here straight away! - [Voiceover] Lance? Lance, what's happening out there? Lance? [engine rumbling] - Cole! Cole, turn that off! - [Cole] I'm taking care of this! - [Lance] Turn it off or I'll fucking kill you! Now turn that off! [engine fading] Gimme the keys! [keys clinking] - Everyone's gone mad here today. I could've taken care of this easily. Nobody would've gotten more than a few scratches. Everything that happens here henceforth, I want you to know, you caused it! - Gentlemen, on behalf of Ayers Mining, I would like to apologize. [metal clattering] I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You all right? I'm sorry. How are you? How are you? - Gentlemen, my name is Ferguson, Baldwin Ferguson. I am executive vice president of the Ayers Mining Company. No need to introduce you lads. Do you smoke? Please help yourselves. I've been informed of the incident yesterday. But I'd like to hear from your side what the background of the problem is. [speaking foreign language] Who is your spokesman? [speaking foreign language] - I'm an tribal elders. - So you're the tribal elder? - Actually, they explained it to me yesterday. We mustn't disturb the dreaming of the green ants. We mustn't wake the green ants up. - I admit that from the side of Ayers Mining, no inquiries have been put forth. Now please allow me to make an explanation. Until today, we've lacked a representative to contact. Or at least one legitimate person to address. At the same time, may I remind you, that it didn't seem necessary, because this is an area which doesn't bear the official status of a reservation. All of us, and that includes you, are subject to the binding strictures of the Land Rights Act of the Commonwealth of Australia. And we have counter-signed and initialed all necessary contracts and all permissions have been procured. - You tell me, what is it Land Right Act? Because we have been here for 40,000 years, longer than you cames. If you're gonna mining in this land, you're gonna destroy the land of green ants. And green ants will come out and destroy the whole universe world. - What we're doing here is exploring an option. Hackett, please explain the nature of our activities. - Well, these are only preliminary tests. We don't yet know much about the geological substructure of the region. Look, let me put it this way. If you have a tree trunk there in front of you, well you don't yet know much about how it looks inside. So you tap it, and listen, and you can see if it's hollow or not. Well we're listening to the earth's interior. - You'll have to shoot us first, before you move in. - Well, that's an option we've not considered, naturally. But you must absolutely understand that we will take legal steps. - We wish to invite Mr. Hackett from your company to come and talk to us and stay with us. - That seems sensible. What do you say, Hackett, it is up to you. - Look, I'm only a geologist. - I'd rather think of you as an employee of Ayers Mining, more. - Yeah, so I am. - [Voiceover] Gather round, fellas. - It was here, it was here that he was last seen. - Yes, well the real problem is that these northern tunnels here run into some natural caverns. They haven't been explored thoroughly yet but we do know they're pretty complicated. Rock formations are stable, they won't fall in or anything but it's a real labyrinth. All sorts of levels. - [Older Woman] Then we need ladders. - I don't think so. Anywhere we'd need a ladder to get to, he'd need a ladder to get to as well, if he'd gone in. - But perhaps he fell down. He could have fallen down. Oh, poor Ben. [chatter] [whistling] - [Voiceover] Here boy! [whistling] [fire crackling] [didgeridoo droning] [didgeridoo droning] [percussion instruments tapping] [singing in foreign language] - I've been authorized by the board of directors to make the following proposals. Ayers Mining is prepared to make a substantial cash settlement, the value of which would buy you a new pumping station for your water, a bus to take your children the ten miles or so into town for their schooling. [speaking foreign language] - [Blue T-Shirt Man] He says no. - I've been authorized as well to make a further proposal of a small percentage of the company's revenue from the mine, if that mine proves productive, which of course remains to be seen. - [Blue T-Shirt Man] No. - It's also been proposed that a center for aboriginal art be constructed in the town at the company's expense and be completely under your administration. - [Blue T-Shirt Man] No, you don't understand. - No, you're right, I don't. I'd like to. - Are you Christian? - Well, I was raised that way. - What would you do if I bring bulldozer and dig up your church? [knocking] - [Lance] Is Mr. Arnold in? - [Voiceover] No! - [Lance] I want to talk to him. - [Voiceover] Out! - It's important. I'm Lance Hackett from Ayers Mining. - I know who you are. - I want to talk to you about the local aborigines. You've studied them, you must know them. - I learned nothing, nothing. Except one thing. - What? - [Arnold] You better get out of here. Go back where you came from! Your civilization destroys everything, including itself. - I heard all that at university. - [Arnold] You know how you seem to me? - Tell me. - You're like somebody on a train that's heading for an abyss. Up ahead a bridge is down, and the train is racing towards it. And only you know the bridge is down. And the communication cord is not working. And this train is going so fast towards its doom that all you have time to do is run through the train to the rear compartment. Good day to you. [clapping] [singing] - [Blue Sweater Man] Yes, more more more. ♪ All things shall pass away ♪ Time for the king ♪ And for the conqueror ♪ And for the lamb ♪ And new creation ♪ And the new man Wonderful, wonderful. Have you come to see us? - Yes, I-- - Can I help you? - No, no not exactly. Thanks anyway, I've got what I wanted. - Well ladies and gentlemen, now in your language, in yong-lo, one, two [singing in foreign language] - Ah, excuse me. I'm curious about something. - You've got a complaint, mate, or what? - No no no, come on, over here, over here. It's all right. What's all that about? - Oh, it's a sacred site. - [Lance] There beside the detergent? - It's where the one tree for miles around used to stand. When we put up the shop, we cut down the tree, didn't we? They weren't too happy about that. - No, I can imagine. - IT's where their children are dreamed, that's what they reckon. First the fathers dream the children, then the children are born. - [Lance] And that's the only place the children can be dreamed? - [Store Man] That's right. We used to chuck them out of there, they kept on coming back. We sort of got used to them. We put things low on those shelves that people don't buy much. Oil paint, boot polish. I've belatedly formed the opinion they're good for business. More children, more customers. [metal creaking] [opera music] - I wish the world was as clear to me. I studied rocks and geological strata. I know that the Earth is round and that it moves. But what shape the universe is, and where it's going I don't know. Stars have been discovered rushing with almost the speed of light away from us to the borders of the universe. I can't rid myself of the feeling that one day someone will prove that the universe is like a snail shell coiling in on itself, with an interior and no exterior. And that these same stars that are rushing away from us are in fact on a collision course with us. There are mathematicians working on these theories. They call it curved space. It's like this. A man hangs himself from a rope in a tree and just dangles there, on his rope. Now how many ropes would he need to be absolutely still? How many points of reference so that his position is fixed in a three-dimensional space? How many? One, one additional rope would do it. Then he wouldn't move any more. But how many ropes would we need? How many ropes would the Earth need to be absolutely still in the universe? Because everything moves. How could we become absolutely still? And what would these ropes be tied to? - You white men are lost. You don't understand the land. Too many silly questions. Your presence on this Earth will come to an end. You have no sense, no purpose, no direction. - I'm not getting anywhere with the aborigines. They've knocked back every proposal we've put out. Look, do us a favor, Nance, and send that Telex to Sydney for me tonight, will you? That way they'll have it on their desks first thing in the morning. Yeah. Well I know about the interim order, yeah. What? The Commonwealth of Australia? Oh no, I thought it would only be the Supreme Court. Nance, what are you doing tonight? Oh, I'm in my mobile home with the air conditioning on, all those erotic videocassettes which I really like and a fridge full of stale cheese and half-empty bottles of Riesling. How about you? With James, eh? No, no, he's a nice bloke, for South Australia. I'm not melancholy, I'm fine. Yeah. Well, have a good time, eh? Mm. Good night. Melancholy, eh, melancholy. Or is it toothache? [speaking foreign language] - [Voiceover] Goal, goal, goal, goal! [cheering] Goal! [speaking foreign language] [cheering] Goal! - I said it once and I'll say it again, fucking dirty bludgin' bongs, looks at 'em. All they're good for is getting drunk. What talent, what an example to the world. - Get that out of here. - [Cole] Bloody bongs. Should never have bloody come here. [diesel engine rumbling] - [Ferguson] I'd like to show you the lights of the city from my office tonight. It's on the nineteenth floor. It's the most marvelous view. [beeping] Having a bit of trouble there. I can't figure this out. How do you turn this thing off? Have you got the instructions here, Jane? Even though we're opponents in this lawsuit, we thought we'd invite you as our guests so you can see our point of view. There's a great view from up here. Here we are, number 19. [clanking] Hello, what's going on? Hmm. We seem to be stuck. - [Lance] Obviously. The 20th century should be called off for lack of interest. - [Ferguson] Don't be funny, Hackett. This is preposterous, my time's valuable. I beg your pardon, gentlemen, I'm sure your time is valuable too. We're stuck. Oh, here's the alarm. [alarm ringing] - We could be here for hours. - Well nothing like this has ever happened before. What we take out of the ground was meant for everyone. There's electricity for light, heat, refrigeration, anything you want. Uranium is such a dense matter, that in comparison lead or gold are as light as this cork. [singing in foreign language] [glassware clinking] Thank you, Michael. [singing in another foreign language] [silverware clinking in rhythm] What's he singing about? - He's singing about the happy song that the cor-ky was felled, and agreed. - You know what just occurred to me? We're not really at this table at all. We're still stuck in that damned lift. We wanted so badly to be out of it that we fantasized all this. This is just a figment of our imagination. We're still stuck in the lift. - [Ferguson] Still up, Pat? - [Security Guard] Still up. You had a good evening? - Yes, very good, thank you. Well, it's getting quite late. But the lights of the city are on all night. [metal clanking] - Again? - [Ferguson] I'll call you from Sydney. - [Lance] All right. - [Ferguson] Safe journey, it'll be a long haul. - [Lance] Yeah, thanks. - [Ferguson] I'd like to say goodbye. - [Lance] Good to see you again. Where's Dayipu? - Is anything wrong? - [Lance] Can we be of help to you? [speaking foreign language] What's he saying? What does he want? You can tell us, whatever it is. What does he want? - He want that airplane. - Oh, really? - Why? - We want that airplane in Mentabi. - But there's no airfield in Mentabi. - Well of course the airplane doesn't belong to us. It belongs to the Air Force. Well, under certain circumstances, we might be able to arrange for you to have it. But you wouldn't be able to use it in Mentabi. There's no runway. - We will build the airfield. - Gentlemen, if I might make a suggestion, perhaps you could watch my pilot take off and land, to show you what facilities you'd need at Mentabi. Just give me a little time with my board of directors. My tribal elders. I think we might be able to come to some mutual agreement, with certain safeguards. [didgeridoo droning] - Good morning. Why didn't you knock? How long have you been here? - For a little long while. - Ten minutes? - Yes. - An hour? - Yes. - Overnight since yesterday evening? - Yes, since yesterday evening, since sun went down. - What's going on? - The runway is finished. - Finished? That's impossible. No no, no no no, look. A Caribou, a plane needs at least a half a mile of completely level ground. I have to get on with the firm, we haven't taken this seriously enough. Look, I can supply some earth-moving equipment, but you blokes will have to help. Okay? - Yes, we'll help. - Good. [scoffing] [grunting] [didgeridoo droning] [engine rumbling] [didgeridoo droning] - What is it now? - Them bastards! I went out to lunch, half of them piss off, dead to right, they're like that, our black brothers. And listen to this, my Caterpillar doesn't run anymore. Do you know why? - I have no idea. - Because during the lunch break, some of the younger ones knocked off the transmission fluid. And now they're out in the scrub and the bush, lying about, sniffing the fumes. My Caterpillar! Bludgin' bastards! Bastards! My Caterpillar doesn't run anymore. - You need a holiday, Cole. Relax. - Relax? You're telling me to relax when my Caterpillar doesn't run? What are you talking about? [orchestral music] [wind whistling] - Why am I here? Well, it's not visible. But there's nowhere else in Australia where the Earth's magnetic field is so abnormally distorted. - And you've measured that? - Yes, of course. Because the green ant is the only living creature on Earth with a sensory organ attuned to magnetic fields, like a small green living compass, I drive them crazy by beaming in additional magnetic fields. [engine rumbling] [metal clanking] Your friends there are capable of transforming whole landscapes. In less than a day, they can build six-foot termite hills as hard as rock. They always align themselves, north-south. They dig immense tunnel systems under the earth. They feed on wood, they gobble up everything. They can even chew through lead-reinforced roofing to get at the wood beneath. They're not provided with a fully digestive system of their own. And so they live symbiotically with one-celled bacteria-sites in their inter-sty-al tracts. Biologically speaking, the green ant does not at all belong to the ant class, they only look that way. They're actually a kind of termite and belong more properly to the family of cockroaches. If you get me. - [Lance] What about the aborigines? I mean, why is it that they always-- - The abos! Black fellas. They must have observed that our tiny friends are like weather vanes before a storm. Whole armies, they align themselves north. And then they stop in the middle of their tracks. That's when they're said to be dreaming. They dream of the dream time. Of the origins of the world. - Well, what I actually wanted to know-- - Ah yes, the ants are sexless. - Sexless? - I hope you know what I mean. Only once a year, they grow wings and fly east over the mountains in mall-o swarms. Only two individuals in that gigantic swarm assume sexual differentiation and mate. The female becomes the queen. And the male, the courting prince. Now do you get me? The female lays 40,000 eggs a day. Many times more than her own weight. She's immobilized in the heart of the structure. She grows to a hundred times her original size. She'll grow to the size of almost two inches. The male remains tiny and fertilizes the eggs. He often seeks refuge under the queen. He's easily frightened. When the queen, I hope you can follow me, when the queen becomes sterile, the whole colony begins to die off. Warriors come. Multitudes to lick the queen until she's licked to death. And then a new generation prepares to fly east over the mountain. [airplane roaring] [excited chatter] - [Ferguson] Hello, good to see you. - [Lance] Oh yeah. - [Voiceover] We met up Saturday. - [Lance] Good to see you, you're welcome. - [Ferguson] A week from today, we'll meet each other in court. But Ayers Mining hopes that this will be seen as a sign of mutual consideration and mutual respect. - [Wire-Rimmed Glasses Man] Mr. Miliritbi? August Baycock. - [Ferguson] Come over here, you must meet the fellas. - [Voiceover] How do you do? - I just need one of your gentlemen to sign for a receipt for this plane. Would you sign this please? - I'd like to add, too, how pleased we are that you see the value of compromise. - [Wire-Rimmed Glasses Man] Mr. Dayipu, if you could just sign here. - [Voiceover] Well this is great. - [Voiceover] Isn't this great? - There it is. Can you get a photo over here please? Good luck, good luck with the Caribou. It's all yours. - Perhaps if one of you gentlemen could sign this document, it's just a release form, just a formality but we do need it. Mr. um, Mili- - [Ferguson] Miliritbi. - Yeah, sorry. [laughter] Please, I do need a signature. Mr. Dayipu, perhaps you could sign for me. - Just a formality, it's just a-- - [Wire-Rimmed Glasses Man] I'm sorry, but I do need a signature, I do need a signature from someone. [speaking foreign language] Mr. Dayipu, please, I do need someone. - [Voiceover] I'm sorry, you can't climb on, no no no. Mr. Blakeson. - [Wire-Rimmed Glasses Man] Please sign this. [speaking foreign language] - Come over here. - [Wire-Rimmed Glasses Man] Could I have someone sign this? - What have we got to do to get this man's signature? - Forget it, don't worry about it, they've got their plane. They've got their plane, that's all they want. - Philip, Philip, come over here. Hang on, hang on. Now look. - [Philip] We must, for insurance purposes-- - They wanted their plane, they've got their plane. Forget about it. [mumbling] - Oh my god, they're setting the aircraft on fire. No, it's only a campfire on the floor there. I tell you what, we'll have to drain the fuel and alter the wings fore and aft, but then it should be okay. - [Other Pilot] All right, man. [percussion instruments tapping and didgeridoo droning] [singing in foreign language] - Now listen, I'm gonna tell you, gonna tell you one thing. I was the only partly black pilot in the Air Force. My captain, he said to me, "Watson, you got class." [weak laughter] ♪ My baby does the hanky-panky No worries, still half a tank of gas left here. ♪ My baby does the hanky-panky [machine parts whirring] [engine rumbling weakly] [engine rumbling] [engine fading] - Silence! Silence. All stand please. And remain standing. All persons having business before this honorable court are commanded to give their attendance and they shall be heard. God save the Queen. Be seated, please. - I open the proceedings in the matter of Dayipu and Others Plaintiffs versus the two defendants Ayers Mining Company and the Commonwealth of Australia, which is represented by the Solicitor General. I feel it's important to say at the outset that this case before this high court is not merely one of aborigines dispossessed of their access to land by the white man, finding in the activities of Ayers Mining Company a final assault on their beliefs. It's also a case that raises fundamental moral questions of great complexity. We must here discover whether the aboriginal plaintiffs hold, in fact, in common law a land rights title valid before 1788 to territories annexed by Governor Philip, who, by hoisting the flag, claimed all of this vast continent for the British crown. - At this point, Your Honor, it might assist the court if I could quote from Professor Ernst's discussion of the dama-kamala and je-moon-da-mala. In this he describes a claim to certain land, a claim which goes back to unthinkably ancient times, what they call their dream time. He also explains their clan relationship, which he identifies as a maka-mala combination. Professor Ernst even speaks of a maka-mala pair. The clan is essentially a patrilineal descent group, which is strictly exogamous. In other words, each member of the clan may marry only into the other half of the maka-mala combination. Now this brings us to the concept of the so-called moiety. And I must stress that this area of anthropological theory is still highly speculative, not to say controversial. There are certain aspects of it indeed that lie within the realms of as-yet unexplained mysteries. - Objection, Your Honor. - The Solicitor General. - [Solicitor General] The witness is putting forward as expert evidence what are clearly presumptions and theories. He should be asked to confine himself to proven facts. - Objection overruled. The court is competent to reach its own conclusions, thank you, Mr. Coulthard. The witness will continue. [speaking foreign language] - We care to tell you about the land, so court can recognize the land that we is living on. If the mining company coming and digging the earth all this through the land, that mean, that destroy the people. [speaking foreign language] That mining company come and destroy the land and the feeling of the people and for that dreaming, green ant dreaming. [speaking foreign language] If you're gonna destroy the land, which is sacred land, a special area, dreaming land for green ants if you gonna drew, that mean you gonna destroy the people, the green ant, and you never come back again. [beeping] [muffled beeping] - Will the counsel for the plaintiff please explain what is meant by that? In answer to a specific question, relating to the precise limits of his territory, your witness answered with this gesture. Can you translate that into English? - Please, Your Honor. - Order, I call the Solicitor General to order. - And on the question of the exact expanse of the tribal territory, I hear "a little long way." Now what I'd like to know-- - Mr. Coulthard, will you please restrain your boundless gift for irony? - With your indulgence, Your Honor, I'm very angry that evidence of this order should be admitted by the court. As well as repeated statements which are clearly hearsay by the aboriginal witnesses. - I order that the transcript to this proceedings be so written as to include indications of descriptive gestures by the plaintiffs. And I assure Mr. Coulthard that this court will decide, in this case and in all others before it, what is and what is not admissible evidence. - Your Honor, I do not withdraw my objection. - Mr. Coulthard, I trust I don't need to remind you of the elaborate representations by the plaintiffs' attorney in the case me-sha-ga Indians versus the Dominion of Canada on the admissibility of evidence by the tribal witnesses as long ago as 1871. And as to your remark about hearsay, I'd like to remind you of the decision in the case An-goo versus Atta, before the Privy Council of the Gold Coast West Africa in 1916. You are, of course, familiar with that decision? - No, Your Honor, I'm sorry, I'm not. [scoffing] - You're not? Then would you be so kind as to inform yourself of this case? In An-goo versus Atta, the African indigenes reporting on tribal customs gave evidence essentially founded in hearsay and in such overwhelming frequency that these testimonies became so widely attested as to condense into a palpable truth. And the courts had to take judicial notice of them and henceforth recognize hearsay as admissible evidence. And in my view the proceedings before this court today form a close parallel with those proceedings I have referred to. - Progress. Here, you talk about progress over and over again. And what does it leave the aborigine? It is progress into nothingness. What have the last 200 years brought? Extinction. And where that wasn't radical enough, cultural extermination by the white civilization. Simple outright murder was only part of it. - Order. This court is not a forum for political oratory. - Let me get back to the disputed numerical concept of the aborigine. Their relationship to quantities is distinguished completely from ours. It is not subject to abstract enumeration. Therefore, in most tribal languages there are only numbers from one through to three. Everything beyond that is called "many." However, if a black cattleman has a herd of 600 cows, together, enclosed in a corral, he will know at a glance, without even counting, that two cows are missing. We still have rudiments of this ability. If, for example, a mother with six children is loading suitcases on a train in a crowded station, and one of the children escapes to the milk bar, that mother would know, with a single glance, without counting, that one is missing. [speaking foreign language] - Mr. Ba-li-la, you were not called to the stand. Mr. Miliritbi, could you please make this clear to Mr. Ba-li-la? - Your Honor, I'm afraid I cannot speak his language. - The plaintiff Mr. Mr. Ba-li-la was introduced to the court as mute at the start of these proceedings. I feel slightly confused. Is there anyone among the plaintiffs or witnesses who can translate? - The situation, Your Honor, is, this man is the sacred custodian to the secrets of his tribe and his tribe has died out. He is the sole and final survivor of his people, his clan. They call him the Mute, because there's nobody left on this earth for him to speak with. - Mr. Miliritbi. - Your Honor, we come here to show you the most important sacred object what we belong, and for the land. Please, I want you to remove the people. If they see this sacred object, the world must destroy. - Motion accepted. Ladies and gentlemen, will you please leave the court? Mr. Miliritbi, you are aware, however, that for reasons concerning the very nature of these proceedings the defendant as well as the court reporter must be present. - This sacred object is very, very important. This sacred object have been buried in the ground for two hundred years. Now we come and show you the proof, what the land is belong, and belong to the land is. Most important to our life, to our feeling. - [Court Reporter] And how should I record this, Your Honor? - Wooden object, carved, with markings. The markings indecipherable. The significance of the markings not plain to this court. - Silence. Silence, all stand and remain standing. Be seated, please. - For all the reasons given, my decision must be for the defendants. The claims of the plaintiffs for radical legal title to the territories in question are rejected. This title lies, as before, with the Crown. The claims of the aborigines do no not accord with the provisions of English common law, which, though imported, is nonetheless, perhaps regrettably, the law of the land. I am most grateful for the dignity and eloquence with which all parties have argued this difficult case. The action of the plaintiffs is dismissed. The cost of the proceedings will be paid by the Commonwealth. [muttering and shouting] - Land rights now! [shouting] - Well if you don't want my opinion, don't bloody ask for it. - What's got into you, Hackett? - Look, you're talking about a settlement out of court, but what have they got to negotiate with? They've got nothing left. - [Voiceover] Wonderful job, Eric. My profound congratulations. - We destroyed kr-atz. - [Ferguson] Now look, no court in the world can pass judgement on 200 years of history. - What do you eat for breakfast, eh? Raisin Bran? How do you sleep, do you sleep well? With the air conditioning on? How are your thoroughbreds? - [Ferguson] What's wrong with you? Whose side are you on? - Sorry, sir. Do you want me to have a talk with him? [somber music] - [Lance] Hello there. I've brought you some food. Can I ask you a question? - [Miliritbi] Yes. - Tell me, why is it you sometimes, and Dayipu pretty well all the time, just sit here looking east? - Because in the east is the spirit land and special area that the green ant have been disappeared, never come back. - So that's your dreaming land? - [Miliritbi] Yes. - I see. I'll roll you a smoke. I've never done this before. [wind whistling] [string music] - I used to be fullback on the squadron rugby team. "Watson," the captain used to say. "You can play fullback." I caught a fly. I bet I was even better than that captain. - So you flew a plane, a real plane? - Course I did, I flew. I tell you, one day we had the sir-cu-la-tors out there, full of 'em. And that captain said to me, "I can't get this big bugger off this ground." I said, "Captain, just let me handle it." I just gave it that throttle. Vroom, vroom, vroom. I got that plane off the ground, that captain couldn't. - I don't believe it. - I'll show you, watch. ♪ My baby does the hanky-panky ♪ My baby does the hanky-panky ♪ My baby does [hydraulic lift roaring drowns out other sounds] [beeping] [engine rumbling] [engine sputtering] [engine roaring] - Hackett, I think we've got a problem. You know your black fellas? Hackett, they've taken the plane! - What? - They've taken the plane! [engine rumbling] - Is Ferguson there, over? I've gotta talk to him. - [Voiceover] He's out of town, you can't talk to him. - I've got to talk to him. - [Voiceover] Sorry, he's unavailable. He's out of town. [helicopter whirring] [wind whistling] [opera aria music] - I've been having this dream lately. Everyone in the world is running away, and all carrying little packages as big as lunchboxes of their most precious things. Thousands of them, running, stumbling. And I can't run with them, I've got to go to school, and it's a Catholic school. A nun comes up to me, and grabs me by the arm, drags me into a circle of other nuns and schoolkids. And they all shout at me, "Where's your lunchbox?" And I can't answer, I get frightened. And I piss my pants. The piss just keeps coming, and coming. It runs in a little stream out along the ground. First the nuns, and then the schoolkids, open a pathway to let it trickle on through. And they keep staring at me. It's never really happened to me. It's never really bothered me. I feel I'm in that. I'm in that situation. [singing in foreign language] [singing in foreign language] - A-five is negative, B-five is negative, C-five is negative, and fuckin' D-five is negative! - The plane had only enough fuel for 40 minutes. - Yeah, it's a puzzle, isn't it? There are enough ravines in those mountains for them to go down in. It looks as though we're gonna have to start this whole shit-fight all over again. - Some tribal aborigines arrived yesterday from up in the mountains. Maybe they've got something to say. They just sit there, saying nothing. You know, the way they do? - Yeah. You find out what you can from those black bastards. They seem to like to wanna speak with you. - I'll do that. - They can ride bicycles and they can drive motorcars. Now they think they can fly fucking aeroplanes. [engine roaring] [helicopters whirring] - [Miliritbi] A while ago, I spoke. You listen for yourself. [singing in foreign language] They have heard the green ants with the big wing, you know, Mr. Hackett? There's a little green ant trapped on the ground. These people, they found it on the mountain big, big wings. - They found a wing? - Yeah. - [Lance] They found the plane. [explosions booming] [somber music] [wind howling] [speaking foreign language] - [Voiceover] Goal, goal, goal! [cheering] Goal, goal, goal, goal, goal, goal goal goal! [cheering] Goal! [speaking foreign language] Goal! [speaking foreign language] - Well, what's the news? - They found the plane. Up near un-a-detta. - Indeed. - This is nice. Are these easy to come by? - There's my old water tank still out there. - Thanks. [explosions booming]
