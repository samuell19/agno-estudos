(energetic rap music) - Ladies! - All hail the Queen! - The New Vice President of Investments! - Oh! Stop, stop. No, I was being modest. Keep going. - Girl, seriously, congratulations! This deserves a toast. - Hi, what can I get for you ladies? - More champagne, three kamikaze shots, a long island, and ... What do you all want? - I'll just breathe in her fumes. - Actually, do you guys still have that Hawaiian Kona macchiato? - Yes, we do. - I'll take one of those. - You and your coffee fetish. - Obsession. You're still planning to pitch Glickman that grand cafe idea? - Absolutely. All a part of my master plan. And with this promotion-- - Uh! This is not a power point party. Which is why we didn't invite any of your fake work friends. We, your real friends, are here to celebrate your well-earned, and much-sacrificed promotion. - Oh, you guys! You shouldn't have! (vibrating) (laughing) You guys. You really, actually shouldn't have. - We just figured since you've been working so hard, and now you got the promotion, that you should start looking after your own interests. - And what interest is this? - Turning that desert back into the tropical oasis it used to be. How long has it been? - Eight months, two weeks, four days. But who's counting? - Francesca! Easy fix. Swipe right. - Really? - You need to start owning the strong, successful goddess that you are. Can't you see that you have the pick of the wealthy litter right here? What about hedge fund Henry? - Sweet on the eyes, but as shallow as that bottle cap he was holding. - Trust fund Trevor. - Ew! He looks like he's already had four wives. Pass. - We're just trying to help. I mean, all you're missing is that good ole', long, strong, vitamin D. - But I don't just want the D. I want more. - More? I don't get it. What more? - A friendship. A connection. Hell, an undeniable electrifying spark. - Oh, like ... true love? (laughing) - [Jen] True love my ass! - For real. This New York! - I know, I know. Aim for the moon ... - Settle for financial parity. - [Jen And Ingrid] Or a new vibrator! - [Waitress] Here's your Kona macchiato. - Thank you. - [Ingrid] Cheers, ladies. - Cheers. Coffee consumers can purchase their coffee beans online, but they cannot purchase a coffee shop experience. I am not a desert. Mr. Glickman, as the Vice President of Investments, it's time we make our move into the brick and mortar side of the coffee industry while the iron is hot. While the iron is hot. Last year alone, consumers spent over $19 billion at coffee shops. A consumer's relationship with coffee is deeply personal; And the human interaction that takes place in a coffee shop enhances the emotional connection and overall experience. This, in turn, sustains the loyal, repeat customers who associate their coffee with a special social interaction. They become addicted to the sense of belonging. (phone beeping) What! - From what we know so far, the FBI has issued a search warrant for high ranking, financial executives who allegedly masterminded an account scam resulting in major bonuses and financial kickbacks. Managing Director, John Glickman, and newly appointed Vice President Francesca Goode, at the Bank of Merit, have been targeted as prominent execs first to be exposed. - Glickman, can you please tell us why you did it? Was Francesca Goode the mastermind behind your scheme? What do you have to say for yourself? - [Reporter] What do you wanna say to your employees? - Not to worry about this. Just a misunderstanding. You'll see. Stay calm and don't say a word without the presence of your attorney. - You've gotta be shitting me! I'm freaking out! What if they come to my door? - Girl, relax. What did your attorney say? - Just to stay calm but I can't. They're not letting anyone into the office. - You should've called me sooner. - Why, Anita? What were you gonna do? - Bury my foot in your boss's narrow ass! He set you up. - No, okay, we don't know that. - It's not your fault you make the perfect fall guy. Nice, likeable, unsuspecting. - Really, Anita? - Glickman's a dick! Hope he gets tons of it, too, where he's going. - My promotion. Was it even real? - No ma'am! Don't even start second guessing yourself. - No, okay, never that. I'm just a bit blind-sided. - Seriously, sis. You need to just bring your butt back home to Hazlehurst, where it's safe, boring, slow. Leave all that madness in New York. - Anita, no, absolutely not. I am not tucking my tail and running. I'm gonna stay, clear my name and fight this. I'm sure my lawyer will clear all of this up and everything will be fine. - Well, the good news is you won't be arrested and charged like Glickman. - Why would I? I'm the victim here. - I know. However, the bad news is the government has frozen all your financial resources. Bank accounts, credit cards, IRA's, you name it. - Hold up, they did what? - It's standard protocol. Just until they sort things out. - So ... I have no money. I lost my job. And I can't work in the only field I know? - This is the FDIC, IRS and FBI we're dealing with. They are, for lack of a better term, 'bout they money. (screaming) - From the looks of it, Glickman was in the process of firing everyone above you in order to keep them out of any trouble; which meant someone had to take their place. - Which was me. Wow. So my promotion, it was all a fake. That asshole! I want to file a lawsuit right now! - Well, stand in line. There will be hundreds filed. Civil, criminal-- - Wait, wait. How am I suppose to live? - Cash only. - It's all in my bank account! Okay? - Listen, this thing is gonna take some time. Everything is being seized. My advice is that you take whatever money you have-- - And what? - Leave town. Do you have anywhere that you can go that's ... - Safe? Boring? Slow? You payin' for this, right? (laid-back music) - Whatcha drinkin'? - Uh, something ... strong. - We got that. - As much as I can get ... with this. - That somethin' got a name? - Apple martini. You know what, I'll let you decide what that something is. (sniffs) (coughing) Ooh! Was this distilled in BC or AD? (sighs) (coughing) What was that, gasoline? - Yeah, of course you don't want to hear from me. But I can't help it. (energetic hip hop music) Can I get another? So, that iss how you burn fat without even exercising. No? Wait. Where you going? Ah, come on, come back! I won't talk about exercising no more. I'll buy you another shot! Ooh, I got money in my sock. (barking) (gasping) - She's alive! - Bobby! - Yeah. - Why am I in your apartment? How did I get here? And what happened last night? Wait, wait, I'm sorry. Before you start, do you have coffee? - No. - [Francesca] Damnit! - You really don't remember anything? Well ... I was at work, swamped, wrapped it up as quickly as I could when I got your text. Then I pulled up on you, just in time. - Just in time ... for what? (curious music) - [Bobby] Francesca! - Hey, I want her outta here. Now! - You don't have to be so mean. I'm taking this. This is mine. Come on, you guys! My life a shambles! Oh, don't be stingy, bro! I've been here entertaining all your customers. You can share with me. I'ma be back for my money! You're mean. You're really nice though. He gave me some good-- Oh, hi, you so kind. How you doing'? Oh wait, we gotta get my stuff. - Um, let's just get you to the car first. - But wait, what if they try to steal my purse? There's a whole bunch of money in my purse. Not. (laughing) - She's not normally like this. - Yes I am! Yes I am. (whimpering) Okay. - Yeah, so um, this isn't at all random. - Hm, I see. Well, I would, um, like to offer an official apology from the sober me. - Stop. It's fine. I spoke to Anita. And she asked if you could sleep it off over here. Figured you'd prefer your family not to see you like that. - Yeah, well, thank you. Thank you both. - I mean, it happens. I left you some fresh towels in the bathroom if you, you know, wanna-- - Wash off the shame, sure. Yes. Sure, I would like to. Bathroom? Okay. (groaning) My body hurts. Did I fall? - Yay. Welcome home. (energetic hip hop music) - Bang. - Thank you! Mm-mm. Uh ... (sighing) My taste buds told me to do that. - So, how are you holding up? - That means you already know. I see bad news travels fast. - Well, I've been keeping tabs. - Yeah, some friends they turned about to be. I can't believe they dropped me like that, thinking I did it. My work friends did me the same. (light music) - Well, thanks for the Lyft. Four stars. - Nice pun. Hey, do I at least get a tip? - Ooh, well, I'm tapped. (chuckles) But would you settle for a hug? - From the girl voted prettiest late bloomer in Hazlehurst High? No question! - What! So I get to hug the guy voted nicest smile and hottest nerd? - Well, I gotta get to the office. - Yeah, and I should probably stop stalling. - Hit me up later if you need anything. - Okay. Thank you. (soft piano music) - Okay, so remember to lay off the sweets and floss after eating, okay? - Ah! Dr. Brookshaw, can I see you a moment? (Anita oohing) - I'm having Mr. Collins come back in a couple days for the extraction. I know his PPO won't cover it, but I really feel like we shouldn't-- - Okay. It's fine, Dr. Brookshaw. - Um, I thought that we agreed that we wouldn't-- - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Around the office. - [Anita] Mm-hm. - 'Cause you said no. Go. Bye! - Oh! You need to talk that monster down before you come ova' here. Y'all gotta stop that. This is a professional place of business. - She call? - Not yet. How drunk was she? - White girl wasted. She's hurting. - You didn't mention anything about my dad, did you? - Not a word. - And you didn't tell her everyone knows about her work situation, did you? - That. She suspects everyone knows. - It's eventually gonna have to be addressed head on. Better it's out in the open now. Unlike ... Still up. Just go outside and think about baseball or something. 'Cause you're distracting me from my work. - Home run. - [Anite] Mm-hm. - What! Sis! - Deon. Look at you! - Anita said you was gonna be by yesterday. (chuckling) - Oh, look at you! (giggling) - Yeah, a lot done changed since then, huh? - Yeah. And when did dad decide to remodel? And when did you decide to stop being such a lil Gerber baby? - Yo, yo, yo, it's DJ D'On, shawty. What it do? Hey, go get something to eat. - Okay, DJ D'On. It smells good up in here. Last I remember, you couldn't make a PBJ. (uncanny ringing) - The secret is the chocolate. - I know, I know. Okay, yeah, yeah, no, we're about to go. - No. No, no, no, no, no, no. What the hell? - Okay, Kevin, Kevin, Kevin, stop bouncing that ball in the house, sweetness. And Mimi, get back in your chair, baby, before you fall, okay? - [Anite] What ... - Ooh, girl, lemme call you back. - Kandi? - Future bride? - No, nope! - [Kandi] Of-- - Don't say it. - Frankenstein! Girl, I haven't seen you since ... - Uh, grade school, when you were my baby-sitter? I know. And that nickname has been long-time been buried. - Look at you! You done grown up, grown into your face, got new teeth. I see and out them ortho shoes. When did you get here? - What are you doing here? - Nobody told you? I pretty much stay here. - (chuckling) No, seriously, what are you doing here? - Oh, and those are my babies. This is Kevin, and that's Mimi over there. (dribbling) - Ooh, damn, that hurt! - Bad word! - [Kandi] Mm-hm. - That's one dollar that goes to the cuss jar. Pay up! - Okay, I'm sorry. It won't happen again. - All right, Kevin, now come on. I already told you. Get your stuff, we're already running late! - Girl, he got a callback to be on that reality show. He 'finna be a star. (laughing) Well, welcome back. It is so good to see ya after all this time, Franceskenstein. - No one calls me Franceskenstein anymore. - Franceskenstein! - [Francesca] No, it's not. No one calls me that. - It just fit. - I don't even know you, lil baby. - Francescastein! - Okay. - Ya, that's right. Say goodbye to Miss Franceskenstein. Okay, bye, baby. - Oh, bye. What? - Lettin' out all that cold air, girl. (chuckling) - Cordell? Man, you can't be running up on people like that! - Running up on people is how I'm literally out here securing this bags and cashing these fat checks, ya feel me? (laughing) What up witcha, sis? - What are you doing? You out here selling mixtapes or something? - Naw, naw, naw, naw, it ain't nothing like that, man. The Deacon got me out here hunting thise skips, right? So I was going at this little young fella, man, and so I had to blend in. - Well, your costume devotion is admirable. - Come on, this how young boys out here dressing today, man. You know, with the purses, dresses, skinny jeans, leggings. I'mma have to get 'em any way I can, you know? - So did you catch him? - Oh, hell yeah. That boy had 10 racks on that head. You know I had to get them bands. (laughing) - Oh, hey, Junebug. You home. - (chuckling) Yo, he's special ops, so he's been training to be a man of few words, right? 'Cause, you know, it's an irrational fear of being caught by ISIS. Leave him alone. - In Hazlehurst? (chuckling) - Wars never over. They're everywhere. - Oh, and I see you finally landed yo childhood crush, Kandi, after all these years. I met her kids. They bad, but. You playing surrogate? - Whatchu' talking 'bout? We ain't together. - Oh, I'm sorry. I just thought. So, Junebug? You and Kandi are ... - Pssh! - Don't tell me y'all let Deon get with Kandi of all people? - Ah, hell nah. He into college girls and music. He ain't thinking about getting with no late-30s MILF. - Stop playing. - Yo, pops, he got game, man. He out here living his best life. - [Francesca] I was just here! - Yeah, a year ago. When we come to find out they been rockin' on the low for a year and a half. - So, no one bothered to inform me that our dad is dating the poster child for bundles and tummy tea? - Aye, Frankie, your service has been requested upstairs by the man. - Ah! So, if you got a problem with it, it's the perfect time to go discuss it with him. - Hey! Confront The Deacon! - Yeah, go talk to daddy! - I don't care what you do. Just find him. (chuckling) Girl, let me look at you. (hollering) Looking more and more like your mama. (chuckling) Come here. So how's everything? Work? New York? Everything. - Everything is great. It's really, really great. How are you? - I seen better days. I'm doing all right considering I'm laying eyes on you. You know, when Anita said you were coming, I thought she was selling me wolf tickets. And I was willing to pay full price. (chuckling) One year. That's precious time. I know dad. I just got a earful from Cordell. I'm here now, that's all that matters. So, I see you made some changes to the place. - I did. A while ago. - So, where is mom's vanity? And all her stuff? (sighing) - Downstairs. - Downstairs? Like the basement? - And the shed. I made some changes. - Well, that's an understatement. Up here. The kitchen. And why is everyone calling you Deacon? - Because I like-- - Does it have something to do with the baby-sitter from hell being back here? 'Cause right now I just really feel like nothing is making sense, and I think it has something, or everything to do with her. - So you think that every-- - Yes, I think. Were you even gonna tell me? - Listen, baby girl, I just ... I wanted to have a face to face conversation when it came to me and Kandi Pop. - Never mind. It's too much to process. Let's have this conversation when my shock wears off. - All right, fair enough. So where you staying? You staying at one of them fancy hotels? Or you got your real estate agent to find you one of them, what they call them, Airb-- - Airbnb, daddy. - Yeah, that's it. - Well ... - Ah, go on and spend up all ya' money. You know, you'd think you'd wanna stay here. But I get it. Bit crowded. (phone ringing) - Yeah, go ahead and answer that. I'll be around daddy. Oh, I'm sorry. I mean Deacon. (soft music) - You still here? Deacon said you had an Airbnb. - [Deon] Hey sis, you sure you don't wanna crash in your old room? - No, Deon, it's your room now. - I just put fresh linen out. Otherwise, you gonna be bunking down here with those two in the dungeon. - Uh-uh, that is definitely not happening. (chuckling) Where you off to? - Oh, I got me a little reception over in Denton, you know what I meam? They tryna' turn up a little bit, slid up in my DMs requesting my A1 services, you feel me? - [Francesca] Okay! - DJ D'On! (doorbell ringing) - Right. - Yeah yeah! - Hey, get that door though. - But I was watching TV, though so I can't-- - I don't care. - Hey, where she at, where she at? Look at you! Girl, looking like a whole snack! Ay! - But I see somebody has been doing their lunges and squats. - Listen, that squat challenge is everything. - Hey! - Hey! (laughing) - Bye! - Bye. - Bye. - So, where's Deacon? - Oh, I don't know, I wanna say him and that troll-- - Shh! - Rude. - Well I guess we're-- - Come on. You act like you don't see nobody else. So, what happened? I been waiting all day for the real tea. - What tea? - The you-spent-the-night-at-Bobby's house-stupid-drunk-tea. - Oh my god, he didn't tell me he took pictures! He better not post that. - Look, I just need to know what happened. - Girl, nothing happened! It's not even like that. He's not even checking for me like that. - [Kandi] What up, fellas? Ay! - Ah, yass! Come through, hair! Flip it, flip it, flip it, flip it! - Bae who? - Okay, you better work. All right, when did you get this done? I like this! - Excuse us. - Oh! Oops. Didn't mean to bust up the sibling reunion. - We were just talking. Where you two coming from? - The gym. - You know, you gotta watch him. He's always trying to cheat when it's not his cheat day. - I was just testing. - Mm-hm, no you wasn't, daddy. - Oh hell no! This is some bullshit. - Dollar in the cuss jar. - Why does she get to call you daddy? - Oh, I get to call him daddy for all sorts of reasons he just loves. - Don't start this, Frankie. You know the rules. You know how I feel about that kinda language under my roof. Pay up. - You know what? I could fill this entire house full of cuss jars for her. Here. For the near future. - Frankie. (soft guitar music) (knocking) (barking) - Hey! - [Francesca] Hey, Bobby. - Francesca, hey. What are you doing around here? You got a Airbnb around here? - Yeah, maybe. - Uh, let me get your bag for you. - Wait, um ... Do you have plans? Like a hot date? Booty call? - Yeah, but they canceled. You hungry? - Um ... Yeah, I could eat. - So, um ... So, what are you gonna do? - I don't know. I just need some time to figure things out. Hopefully, once all the drama clears, I'll be back in New York, with an even better job. - Hope is not a strategy. Maybe this is the universe telling you something. These are for you. Why don't you just get in my bed? - I'm not gonna put you out your couch. - I mean, you sleep in the bed with me. - I'm sure all of your females would not approve. So, this is fine. (chuckling) - Like, I sleep on the outside, you on the inside. Kick it old school. - I'll cuddle up with Boomer instead. - Fair warning, he snores pretty bad. (light music) - Move over. Um ... Go buy your dog some nasal strips. - I know you can't wait to get back to your old life, but maybe this is all happening so you can start a new one. Good night, Frankenstein. - Good night, Bobby Boogershaw. - Don't play with it. If you gonna eat it, then do it. (giggling) (barking) - (chuckling) Fun dream? - Huh? Uh ... Yeah, I, uh ... I was having this crazy dream. And um ... I had baked you cake and ... you just wanted to play with it. You didn't wanna... eat it. - That's odd. I love eating ... cake. - Fresh towels in the bathroom for ya, and gourmet coffee on the stove. - Oh my god, you drove that far? - Lock the bottom lock before you leave. - Bobby, I just ... wanna thank you for last night. Letting me star, and the much-needed pep talk. Felt like old times. - I'm here for you, whenever you need me. - Did Bobby put you up to that? Vince, this is Francesca Goode, once again. Please call me back. I'm just checking in to see if there's anything new with the case or my money. Call me! - Look who's slummin' today. - I was hoping to catch daddy here. - Please, the Deacon, he don't do no heavy lifting. What you think we do? - Play dress up and make believe. - You know you're a hater. - Take that perp in, man. Hey, you know we need us a female employee. You more than welcome to help out. - Pass. Do you know where he is? 'Cause he's not home. - Old timer's constantly on the move with your BFF. Speaking of, why you go postal like that? - I have my reasons, Friedo. - Hey, do you think Jade knows Francesca stayed at my place last night? - Uh, first of all, I didn't even know she stayed at your place last night ... again. That's twice. Second of all, I ain't said jack to nobody 'bout nothing. You think I'm a snitch on my sister? - DoYyou think I should tell her? - Oh, Father, they don't make 'em like you anymore, and your ass would be an only child. - Shouldn't just keep it one hun'ned? - Boy, no! You can't be this handsome and that stupid. Who taught you bro code? Jade would flip all the way out if she knew some random was laying on her side of your bed. Trust and believe, I've been there. - But we just friends. - Let's play the perspective game, 'kay? I'ma be Jade, you be you, okay? Hey, Bobby, I didn't mention, Tank, my very attractive, very single homie from high school, sorry I didn't mention it, he's been in town and he's been staying at my place for two days. It's no big deal, we're just friends. Yeah. That part. And you had a father in your life. You can't be this stupid. See you next Tuesday. - Ugh, what's that look for? - Yesterday. You and Kandi the Crud. - Do you know where you are? - Yes, is Bobby in? I wanted to thank him for last night. - Uh-uh, don't go bringing that up in here. I like my job. - Hey! - Hey! - Hi! (chuckling) - So, I was thinking about what you said in bed last night- - Girl, if Dr. Montgomery catches y'all, she gon' fire me for sure. - Anita, nobody's getting fired. - Who's Dr. Montgomery? - It's complicated. - Bobby, I like you, but dolls before balls. Francesca she's his boo thang. - Business partner. - What are you talking about? - I thought I mentioned ... - No. I'm sure you didn't. - I haven't had the time to talk about it. - Don't go sugarcoatin' it now. His bae is trying to make them the Michelle and Barack of teeth. - Oh. It's cool. I also wanted to tell the both of you that I have decided to extend my stay a little longer. - Yes! - So, uh, see you guys later. - Bye, boo. Nothing happened, huh? (soft music) (phone beeping) - What! Oh, hell no! - I'm assuming you just heard. - Yes. How much longer are we talking? - Weeks, months, years, no telling. - Well, what am I supposed to do now? - You can start all over. - How Vince? I'm stuck! - I know, but you're gonna have to. This is going to take a while. - I'm sorry. You're right. - I'll call you if I hear anything. - [Deon] Frankie? - Hey, DJ D'on! What's up? (laughing) - Thought you were Junebug up in here scavenging for munchies. Bro, people are sleeping. You want me to take you to your room? - No, no no no. I'm sorry, though. I'm just drunk and hungry. (giggling) Oh, wait, um, Deon, don't leave. I want to tell you something, but it has to be just between us. - What, that you gay? I knew it already. - What! Is there something about me that screams lesbian? - You got mad pant suits on and not one picture on the internet with a dude, so-- - I'm not gay, boy! I'm broke. Penniless! I got nothing. The Feds took everything I had back in New York, and that's why I'm really here. Only people that know are Anita and Bobby. - And me, The Deacon, Cordell, Junebug, Kandi, her kids, the mayou, the people at church ... - What? I told Anita not to say anything! - Look shawty, this is Hazlehurst, all right? Not the damn stone ages. Look, the Deacon must've knew before you called Anita because he told us not to say shit 'til you did. - Are you serious? Everybody knows? (crying) - Chill, chill, all right? Look, we know you didn't cheat those people out the way the news is saying you did, all right? Trust me, we all know. (soft music) Come on. - But I'm hungry! - Man, get this drunk ass to bed. Hey, I could hook you up with a job over at a cell phone store. - No, I'm not working for any more crooks. - Hey, I got me a lil thang over at Hazlehurst Insurance. - No, Deon! I cannot do simple, mindless work. I need to make money and be stimulated or my brain is going to rot. - Hey, you love coffee, don't you? - Yeah. In some strange way, I feel as though I brought this on myself. - Hey, didn't I tell you, I'm the local plug out here making differences in folks' lives? Girl, come on. - I see the hat fits. - It's a cheap marketing gimmick gone bad. - Oh! (laughing) Oh, man, where'd you find her? - Hey, look, I should be able to get you to and from work on most days. But look, if I can't, just take the whip, feel me? - Cool. Thank you. - Let me show you around. Right after you. - Crystal, Lisa? - [Crystal And Lisa] What? - This is Francesca. She'll be working here now. Can you please show her around? - No, no no no, she does not work here! - I am so tired of these old ass people comin' in here takin' our jobs. This is for the teens. - I'm not even 30 yet! - And neither is my mama! What? (phone ringing) - I gotta take this. - This where we keep the push broom, the mop, and the bucket. Get used to it. Tour's over. - I appreciate you helping build up our clientele. - Uh-huh. That's the strategy we discussed. - Our plan was to mainly target families, which is basically ... what I do. - And I haven't? - Ever since you gotten written up in that article and you gone viral, it seems like you're more concerned about being this public figure who's getting likes than our practice. Hell, us. - I'm the reason that lobby is full. - Full of random, thirsty dudes who don't want shit but a picture from you and a follow back. Makes me wonder if they're there solely for you and not their teeth. - (scoffs) You jealous? - No, I'm a dentist. What are you> I mean, you've been upping our prices like crazy, our old customers can't even afford us. I mean-- - Wow! You know what? I'm still a dentist. But I'm also a business woman. This thing is gonna put me in a position where I don't have to worry about who can't afford to pay what and how I choose to charge. - Is there even a grain of passion for your work, or is it just about the money for you? - Yes! It's both. (phone ringing) - Oh, hold on, it's my manager. I am so ready for Houston. Oh wait, did the photographer confirm? Okay, yeah. Awesome, all right, cool. No, I'm gonna look now, I'm gonna look right now. Here I go. - Everything okay? - I mean, you know, I was thinking about getting maybe like an espresso or ... Frankenstein? You really work here? - So this is where you've been hiding for the last few days. - Wait, you guys biked all the way over here? - Oh yeah! Cycling promotes a healthy circulatory system, and a more efficient metabolism, and it enhances endurance. - Okay, ew, thank you for that. - K-Pop. You mind giving us a moment please? - Oh yeah, yeah. Oh, but first let me just get a real quick ... Huh, okay. Yeah, you look real cute in our uniform. - Thank you. (chuckling) Okay, it's a long story. This is just temporary. It's not a career change. - What's going on? I mean, how long were you planning on keeping up this charade? - It wasn't my intentions. - Not telling me about New York? I don't know how you feel about us down here, but ... we are your family. We're here to help. - I don't need help. I'm fine. - Well, I'm here when you're ready. - Are you? 'Cause you're never around. Or just alone enough for us to talk. - Yeah, I'm always on the go. Baby girl. You, uh ... really call this coffee? (chuckling) - I know, right? I'm secretly here to help improve it. That's why I'm really here. - Of course. You know, I figured it was something like that. We'll see ya. - Lata'. Alligata', - Allagata', (laughing) (soft piano music) - Hey, where you going? - To Savannah. - Oh, this is dope! I see you. - Yeah, you should slide through later. Blow some steam off. - Who's gonna watch them if I decide to go somewhere? - I don't know, shawty. Multi-task. Duty calling. - Mimi, I don't think you should have that vase, okay? Wait, and Kevin, don't skateboard in the house. I don't think that's a good idea. - [Kevin] Yes I can! - Okay. How about we clean up the toys before mommy and Deacon gets back? Good idea? Ooh, come blow your nose, 'cause you have a lot going on. Just stand still for one second, okay? Boy, are you-- What are you doing? Get off of my back! - Mimi, tag in! - Tag in? What is happening? Okay, okay. - Hey, are you okay? The door's open. I heard you screaming. - Help! Get off of me. Girl! Goodness! - We won! - Whatever! - I wanted to, um ... I wanted to apologize for the miscommunication at the office. - Miscommunication or flagrant omission? Hm, wuestion of the day. - Don't be difficult. - Difficult or honest? Second question of the day. - If you accept my apology, I'd like to make it up. I'll take you to a movie in the park like old times. - What movie? - It'll spoil the surprise. But it's a classic. - Hood or mainstream? - Both. - Okay, I'm intrigued. Let's go! - [Kevin] Mimi, stop! - I mean, they'll be all right. Somebody'll hear their tiny cries for help if they try to kill each other. I'm kidding. Junebug is downstairs. (laughing) Come on. Oh! - Sorry, sorry. Mister man wanted to take another lap around the park. So how were the kids? - Oh, they were a joy. - Bobby! Good to see you. How are your parents doing down in Florida? - Deacon Goode, they're loving it. - They're loving it. And we don't have time for this. See you guys later. Don't wait up, bye! - [Kandi] These kids and these toys. Hey Mimi, Kevin. What y'all wanna eat for lunch? (relaxed R&B music) - [Francesca] Marcus, darling, I'm not wearing any panties. (laughing) - [Bobby] You gotta coordinate, coordinate. - Bang, bang, bang, bang! - Bang, bang. - My favorite movie ever. A classic for sure. - Oh, looks like I gotta get you back home. - Are your trying to get rid of me already? Just say you have to get home to the wifey so you don't get in trouble. - I'm allowed to have female friends, thank you! - Okay. Well she must trust you then. - She's in Houston at a Dentistry conference or a photo shoot. In ATL with her sorors next week. I don't even know anymore. I just assumed that you'd like to get home. - Well how about you stop assuming and tell me what's next in Bobby and Francesca's wild night out? - Um ... Let me think ... - Oh, come on! Your wild date night in the GA is in need of some repair. There's no spontaneity. There's no wine, no blanket. - Date night, huh? Was this a date? - What? No, you know what I mean. Not date like ... An apology date, that's what it was. - Let me just call Jade real quick. - All right, go right ahead. Check in. Make sure you can stay out. (laughing) - Straight to voice mail. Okay, well, show me your spontaneous date night plan. - How about this? Yeah? Stop acting old! Come on. (energetic rap music) - You got me two hours away from home in the club. Yo, you definitely, you win for sure. - Win what? - Date night ... activity. - [Francesca] Hey! - Hey, hold on! What y'all doing way down here? - Hey, watching the big fish in even bigger waters gettin' it turnt! - Hey, what up, young Bobby? - Hey, you got it rocking. - I got a table back there. Y'all tryna' turn up? - [Francesca] Yeah! - [Bobby] Yeah. - Hey, let 'em in. - [Bobbie] Hey thanks, homie. - [Deon] Hey look, I got bottles all night, you know what I'm saying? So whatever y'all want, it's on me, ya heard? - Hi! - What you sipping on? - I'm drinking whatever you're drinking. - Two Double Hennessy XO, neat. That's how us southern boys get down. No cosmos allowed. - Whatever! Hey. - [Cordell] Frankie! - What up? (laughing) - [Cordell] Okay. Bobby. - What's good, Cord? - What's up, you? Who's this guy? - So what y'all doing? Creeping? Ain't you with ole' girl, that model chick? The one with all the followers, right? - Dentist with all the followers. Yeah but, Francesca and I, you know, we're just-- - Nah, man, it ain't no judgment. You know, you a solid dude. Plus, lil' sis, she need a good guy like you around. - Well, it's cool that you guys came. That's cool. - Yeah, listen, we always try to make it down to support his events. - Gotta support. And protect. - Yo, Junebug, Junebu, c'mon, man. Let's make a lap, see what's poppin' up in here. - [Junebug] Watchin' you. - Sorry, he means well. Oh! This is a lot. (laughing) Okay. (coughing) - It's your boy, Dj D-On! And we gonna do it just like dis! - That's my shit! - No. No, thank you. - Girl, come on. Come on. (upbeat hip hop music) - Aight, aight, aight. Now, normally I don't do this, aight, but tonight is a special night. It's about doing what you feel, ya dig? (relaxed R&B music) - What's wrong? Hold on. Give me a minute, I'll be right back. - Hey. (phone ringing) - Oh, god. - Jade? - Oh, shit. Bobby. - Nah, nah. That's all you, bruh. Have fun with that. I insist. - Bobby. Bobby! Bobby! Hold on a second! Hold on! Where you going? - Baby, wait up! - [Jade] Baby, would you just calm down? - Take your damn hand off me, Jade. Francesca, I just ... I just need a minute to think. Can you get a ride home with your brother? Isn't someone waiting on you? - Oh, so, you two came together? Like on a date? - I know you think I'm some kind of horrible bitch but I wouldn't worry about what doesn't concern you. - What, like that hickey on your neck? I am just going to keep saying it. You were so good the other night. - [Deon] Appreciate it. - I could see you with like a residency in Vegas someday soon. - One day. But I like your vision. But how 'bout you, though? You out here serving coffee and bussing tables. Shawty, you supposed to be giving orders, not taking 'em. - I know, you're right. But I am implementing a new plan, and phase one starts today. - Okay! (laughing) (phone beeping) That crook! Glickman lied and cut a deal so he can get off! - It's crazy how they always fall but land on they feet, huh? No, come on, come on, come on. Look, come on. - Robert. Would you talk to me? Will you just come and talk to me? Enough already. Say something. - You're right, enough already. We're done. Whatever you need from me, send it through Anita; there's no reason for us to speak, Dr. Montgomery. - Dr. Brookshaw-- - Send in my next patient. - Mm-hm, sure thing, Doctor. - Somebody's late. Maynerd said you on counter. - And to dump the trash. - Oh, well Maynard sounds a lot like Crystal and Lisa. I wonder why. Maynard, can I speak with you for a moment? Do you enjoy long lines, complaining customers, and bickering thots? 'Cause I'm pretty sure the owners don't. - Francesca, I have to fire you. - (chuckles) Me? And not the twerking barbies? Come on, get serious. (chuckling nervously) - I am serious. - Maynard, do you enjoy being a lil' wuss, bossed around by kids? Running a below average coffee shop with terrible reviews? Now come on. I know that couldn't possibly be what you dreamt for yourself. - Um, well, you see-- - Give me two weeks to help you run this place. I will assist you in becoming the professional leader that you don't see but I know you've always yearned to be. - I'm in. - For real? - That was a very inspiring pitch. You sound a lot like my therapist. - Great! I'm gonna show you everything you need to know about how to actually run a business. - Okay. Let's do it! - [Francesca] Let's do it! (laughing) Oh. Okay. Thank you. - [Maynard] Of course. All right. (snickering) - What's so funny? If you got something to say, just say it. - Okay. Your shirt's inside out. - Well, you coulda just said something. Damn! - Cuss jar. Pay up. - Pay up? Girl, my mama made that up, not The Deacon. I bet you didn't know that. - Actually, I did. I mean,hHe talks about her all the time. - And tou can't fill her shoes, so don't even try. - You might think I'm outta line but I would not be that disrespectful to even try. And contrary to what you believe, I love your father. - So why you got him doing all this crazy stuff? You trying to send my daddy to an early grave. - Me, got him? News flash, he the one got me doing all this adventure stuff. I mean, I'm tryna' keep up with him, and raise kids, and work. But if it wasn't for your father, I'd probably still be a punching bag for my abusive babies' father. Your dad saw something in me that ... that I didn't even see in myself. Worth. - You 'bout done in here? - Yeah, yeah, just packing up here. You know, I'm gonna bring this to the car. - All right. - So, where you goin' now? Hot air ballooning? - Oh, I already bungee jumped outta one of them. She won't go back up it it again. (chuckling) We're going to a movie in the park. Going to see Purple Rain. - Why are you doing all this stuff now? You wasn't doing anything like this when mama was alive! - What? You think I'm doing it all 'cause Verdee's gone? Is that what you think? - Well it sure as hell look like it. - When your momma found out she had cancer, it was like ... It was like we both were dying. You may have lost your mama, but I lost my better half. And for that ... I'll never be whole. We had plans. We had plans to do so many things when we retired. But God had other plans. He called my Verdee home before her 60th birthday. That was just too young in my book. So I cursed him. But you mama wasn't having that. She ... made me promise that I'd find someone to do all the things that we planned. She made me promise I wouldn't work too hard or I wouldn't work myself to death. So, that's what I'm doing. Fulfilling my dying wife's last wish. - Look, I get it, daddy, but-- - I mourned your mother! For five long years! I was and lonely. Depressed. And then one day, I realized. My wife was gone from this life. It's time for me to move on. It's time for me to be happy. She makes me happy. - Yeah, daddy, but with her? C'mon! C'mon, daddy. - The thing is ... Kandi likes me. Now, everybody else may not understand that, but she likes ... me. Now, they talk. Call her a gold digger, me a wallet. But nobody actually calls us what we really are. Baby girl. That is truly happy. I mean, we just fit. (chuckling) Love is funny like that. It truly is. (car horn honking) - Well, I guess you shuold get going. - Yeah. - Why don't you go and check out the kitchen. Kandi left something in there just for you. (emotional R&B music) - Hey baby. Red velvet cake holds the power of love. That's why I made it on the third date with The Deacon. You see, I knew he was the one, but I needed him to know it too. And it works. (chuckling) That's why I make it for our anniversary, his birthday, and Valentine's The secret is in the chocolate. Mmm. (chuckling) (knocking) (barking) - [Bobby] All right, all right. - Hey. - Hey, Francesca. I know we left on a weird note. I've been here, doing my own thing. - Yeah, looks like a full on pity party. - What is it? - Hopefully a smile. You know, my mom's desserts were legendary. - I remember. This is my favorite. - You say it like I forgot. A lotta beers here. Thank you. All right. Ready? - [Bobby] Bon apetit. (laughing) (coughing) Did you mistake the salt for the sugar? - I know, right? It tastes like I used dirt instead of chocolate. I remember people used to beg my mom to make them her homemade red velvet cake. - Something you won't ever have to worry about obviously. - That's so wrong! (laughing) - How come she never sold them? - Well, my mom always used to say that you can't buy or sell love, you can only make it. And the only person she made the cakes for was my dad. - You have ... You have a little something on your cheek. - Ow! (giggling) You shocked me! - My bad. - Got it? - No, it's-- - It's still on? - At the little tippy top. - Where? - A little more at the ... - Get it! - Okay, you got it. - Okay. (laughing) - Boom. Can I tell you something that's ... It sounds corny, but it's 100% true? - Go right ahead. - When you smile, it lights up a room. (emotional R&B music) - Well, since we're being truthful. When you smile, you make me gasp for air. Is this the alcohol? - No. It's something I've been wanting to do for a very long time. (upbeat hip hop music) - You're doing great. Your shoulders are back, you have voice. Just follow through. Don't leave until they listen to you. You're the boss. You's a business man. Be a business man. You got it, go, go. - Look, I told you before, and now I'm sick of it. Put the phones down, or you're fired. Go clean something! Put the phone down! Right now! - Okay! - I just wanted to share with you what's happening with your business. You see this? See that spike? - So it's been increasing-- - Profits are going up. - Gosh, thank you so much! - You did it. - No, you did this. - I'm just a coach. You did it. - Hi, I'm looking for Francesca Goode. She works here, right? - Yeah, she's doing some work in the back office. - I really like this red shirt. It screams powerful, strong, so we're gonna keep this one for you. This one has red in it as well, but it's checkered, so we're just gonna steer clear of that. And I'm still not sure about this one, so we're gonna keep this in the maybe pile. So, keep, take back, maybe. Okay? - Thank you, Francesca. - No, no problem. You caught a good sale. - No, for everything. Everyone is happy. In two weeks you've really turned this place around. Shit, you turned me around. - Can you tell her Bobby's here to see her? - [Lisa] Oh, you Bobby. I'll take you back there. - Thank you for seeing what I couldn't see in this place, the staff, and myself. Put it there. Oh! - Oh, sorry, I got it. Well, I am not a life coach, so no one needs to know about this. - Oh, word? Nobody needs to know? - [Francesca] Bobby! - What's happening? - [Maynard] Look man, I don't want any problems - No, there won't be any problems. Bobby, you need to calm down and lower your voice in my place of business. Really, it's not what it looks like. - Then get to telling me what it is. - Excuse me? Or what? - I shoulda known you not the same Francesca I knew before you went to New York. - That is not true, and you know it. You know me. - I did. Have fun until she leaves you hanging like she does everyone else in her life. - Bobby! - Hey, I'm sorry Francesca. But is this gonna affect my incentives pay for the month? - Oh man, my heart is beating. - Hello, hi, yes, I'm calling about the vacant building over on Adams. I was ... Oh, you already have an offer? Well, are you taking any others? If I could beat that offer. Would you mind telling me what that offer is? You said the best cash offer? Okay, thank you. - Yeah, I'm out of this place today. I'm tired of giving everything I have to people who don't deserve it. Yeah, I have movers coming tomorrow. - Hey, Cordell! I was thinking. How would you like to invest some of that money you've been saving since the fourth grade? It's a rainy day fund. Why you over here counting my chips? - Well, you know my situation. So, I was thinking maybe you can invest in this idea that I-- - Pass. People out here getting robbed left and right. - Come on, Cordell! You can't be a cheapskate for the rest of your life. Forget it. I just needed your help. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! You hear what little Miss Independent just asked? Now that's a miracle right there. - Excuse me? - When have I ever had a problem helping, especially family? Ain't the same as an investment. It's all in how you ask. - It's reciprocity. - But how, when you're helping me? I don't have a lot to give at the moment. - That ain't true. That ain't true. (chuckling) - Do y'all got me out here as bait? - Listen. This our skip. He likes the over the top type. - I look like a busted version of Tina Turner. Why I gotta wear this wig? - Hey, hey, focus! All you gotta do is stand out front and look pretty. All right? That's simple. Hey, Junebug. Right out front. - Oh yeah. - Look alive. There go our guy right out front. - Wait, wait, I don't know if I can do it. - Frankie! Ole' boy is worth 50k cash! It's all yours. - Oh, you ain't say that. - Come on, yeah. That's what I'm talkin' 'bout. Show me your black girl magic. - All right. - Nicki! (upbeat hip hop music) - [Francesca] How are you? I'm doing great, better now. Uh, sure, where you going? Oh really? - Yeah, wassup witchu, boy? You ain't think this was going down? - [Junebug] Yeah, get him. I got him, I got him, I got. Make sure she good. - 50K! - 50K! - [Francesca] Hey, 50K! Hey, 50K! (knocking) (barking) Is Bobby here? - Who's asking, Tina Turner? - Francesca. - Oh! The childhood crush. No, Bobby's really busy right now. - Bobby. We need to talk. Can I come in? - No. - Yeah. You Nicki? - See, only a real one would get it. You mind stepping out of the way? - Jade, please. - So why did you come to my job? - Oh, you went to her job? When? Why? - Yes, I came. I came to tell you that, because of you, I dissolved my partnership with Jade. That watching you has inspired me to take a risk on myself. But then-- - I know that we're friends, but we're so much more than that. - Oh, so this is a whole ... This is a whole emotional relationship. - And I'm just now realized it. I believe in monogamy. And you are the only man I want to be with. - I knew it. Bobby, me and you, we're the dynamic duo. - Girl, please! He just caught you in the club with some dude. - And I apologized, and we're working through that. - Do you love her? - Do you love her? - Yes. No. I mean, yes. Shit, I don't know! - Well does she truly love you? - Does she truly love you? - Look, you damn parrot, find your own question! - [Jade] This is ridiculous. (growling) (barking) - Boomer, down! Boomer, down! Francesca, wait! Wait! - Whatever you do, don't you dare run after her! That's just your childhood sweetheart. I'm the best thing you ever had.
