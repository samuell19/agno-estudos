(This is a work of fiction) (Events, personages and places are all fictional) (This is a work of fiction) (Events, personages and places are all fictional) (Any apparent resemblance to reality is purely coincidental.) Ow! Nothing today... Should we go back? Let's return to the TV station. Hey You're... You know me? This may sound weird but, who am I? When I woke up, I was in a hospital. umm.. I don't remember anything, my head hurts. I always wanted to have a word with you. wha- what? It's all your falt However much I work, I can't make money. I keep losing it. I don't understand... Consumption tax! You only know how to raise taxes! Right!? Consumption tax? Found him! That way! That way! Prime Minister Kuroda was hit in the head by a rock, This is his second day off duty, What can you guys do? I'm up here, what can you do? Nothing! You assholes! Eat shit! He's called the worst Prime Minister in history. Even if his approval ratings have dropped to 2.3% violence is not the way to go. I understand the feeling, I also want to punch him. Thankfully, the culprit hasn't been caught. Hopefully he doesn't wake up. How much should I pay? 730 Yen Do you know who I am? I'll definitely pay later so... I don't need it. I can't, let me write it down. I don't care, get out! You're disturbing the customers! Did you find him? Where? What's with that outfit? Pajamas? Were you planning to sleep? Is that it? But how can you sleep here? There's no pillow or futon. Okay This isn't a show, leave! Now! No pictures, leave! Ow! Hold on! I'm the Prime Minister... Oh, really!? I'm with the Earth Defense Force. Ow, you're pinching me, please stop! I get it, you're the Prime Minister. Make me a Security Police. I always wanted to be a one, Okay I promise, I promise. When do you ever keep your promises? Actually, you look like him! Are you his twin? What? What? We came to pick you up, Prime Minister No, wait, I didn't call for you! No, no, no! Memory damage? Yes. He's completely forgotten who he is, including his Prime Minister role. Amazing! Honestly, we don't fully understand how brain systems work. In his case, he seems to have memories from childhood. He doesn't recall his political career. Amazing! Then even his wife... He shouldn't remember. Can he be cured? It's hard to say. He may suddenly remember, or be like this forever. Amazing! Kuroda Keisuke, The 127th Prime Minister and Head of Cabinet This is how the citizens know you: The worst Prime Minister in history. Why am I so unpopular? First of all, stop with the polite suffixes. Is that bad? No, it's just... not like you.. Why am I so unpopular? The reason is, You're indecisive, self righteous, You look down on people, have wolf eyes, don't keep your promises, you're anti-woman, anti-animal... Should I continue? No, that's enough. What is it, Prime Minister? Was there a transfer of money? Please answer, Prime Minister. Prime Minister! Head of Cabinet Prime Minister? I don't recall that. Prime Minister, do you think we'll let this slide? Please answer. I don't remember, That's why I'm saying, "I don't recall" Is that really okay? Construction company president... I'm saying I don't remember. You won't shut up! I don't remember! I don't recall! Listen, for now this is top secret, let's keep this between us. Is that okay? "The current Prime Minister has memory loss" If that leaks out, the political world will plunge into chaos. Anything else? No. Don't let the doctors talk. We should also deal with the people he ran into. Will they stay silent? We'll hand out... non-disclosure payments? We also need to do something about that officer. Yes, this is the secretary office. What about his wife? For now, let's hide it from her. She puts everything on social media. Understood. The Chief Cabinet Secretary will be here soon. Chief Cabinet Secretary Tsurumaru is the head figure of Kuroda's cabinet. It can also be said that he holds the real power in Japan. We've had five Prime Ministers in the past ten years, but he's kept his position. Sounds like an amazing person. He looks good, and has the people's approval. He doesn't know that you lost your memory, I'll leave it to you. Even so, it must have been tough. If his aim was more on point, you would be in real trouble. Vioulence isn't right after all. Well then... Even if they hate you so much... Huh? He seemed pretty healthy. That's fortunate. I almost thought he died, He's a tough pest. I should learn from him. I didn't say a word, wasn't he suspicious? Don't worry. Everyone feels that way in front of him. Umm.. my residence is... Where your family lives. Sorry, sorry, When we walk by here, you would always try to feel me up. I'm not asking you to touch me. You were sticking it out... Sorry That's your only son, Atsuhiko-san The Prime Minister has returned. Welcome home, Prime Minister. Hello It must've been tough, huh? Good work. Thank you. Should I get you something to eat? Yeah... Then, I'll get the usual! yeah, the usual! The cook, Suga-san. That wasn't my wife? Honey...? well… Your wife, Satoko-san. Are you all right? Yes. I'll take my leave now. Thank you. What? That's the first time you thanked me... Prime Minister! Welcome back. Are you alright? Do I still need to worry? Good.. Good! How nice, Satoko. Let's work hard tomorrow. You can't worry about public opinion. Fighting! Who...was that? Your wife's big brother. Your room is by the end of the hallway. Thank you. Good night. Good night. Welcome home. Hello.. Satoko... Here you go... （Live from the Prime Minister's office） I have good news and bad news... First of all, Prime Minister Kuroda was hospitalized tonight. His brain is fine, and he's perfectly healthy. This is the bad news. The good news is... What's important, isn't the Prime Minister's health, but why a rock was thrown at him. The publics anger has come this far. Our party... Yes... It must've been tough. I'm happy your doing well, Prime Minister. Thank you. I'd like to meet soon, alright? Soon? I'll contact you again. Hello？ What? Oh, nothing.. Excuse me..

You have work tomorrow, you should go to bed. Okay. Good night. Sa..Satoko Kimchi Construction company president... Called the worst Prime Minister in history with a record low approval rate of 2.3 % First of all, you'll need to do the pull-up meeting. Do pull-ups? Where? It means ambush interview. Ambush? Journalists surround you and ask questions. I'm not confident... You have to do it. Good luck. Can I do this... It's faster than a normal interview, And you don't have to answer if you don't want to. Even so... You just need to show them that you're back. Leave the rest to us. Prime Minister, what would you like for lunch? Prime Minister? Prime Minister? Prime Minister? Prime Minister? Prime Minister? Someone call for me? Prime Minister, what would you like for lunch? What do I usually get? You really like pizza. Then pizza. Toppings? You usually get 12 times chese. 12 times? They can do that? For you, yes. Your favorite words are: "This is on the house" Prime Minister Just exchange greetings and leave. Okay... Yes. Prime Minister, please. Sorry for making you worry. As you can see, I am fine. That's all. Prime Minister, were you really hospitalized? No more questions. Prime Minister, please follow me. Do you say you have no responsibility as an appointed official? Oh no! Are you okay? Are you hurt? No... Were you hit? Are you okay? No way... Camera! Take pictures! Be careful. Thank you... Well, Prime Minister, that way is... Prime Minister. This way. Everyone is waiting. Good luck. Pardon me. ・Prime Minister Welcome back. Hello,I'm back. Prime Minister... That is my chair. It's been a while so... About the that one matter, shall we continue with that? In that way? Let's go with that. But then that will turn into that... Well, of course that has risks... but, if we go with that, Then that will be that'd by that. Of course... Excuse me... but Prime Minister, It's about time for the cabinet meeting. Let's go to the cabinet room. First, the Minister of Health, Labor and Welfare, Sakurazaka Has something to say. Sakurazaka-kun Prime Minister... For this, I'm really sor... I can't hear you. This time, I have caused you great harm, I am extremely sorry! What did he do again? so...sorry. I sort of forgot. You don't know? He already forgave you. Thank you verry much! What... did he do? Pleas let me go.... I skipped the National meeting and went to a Phillipine pub. He sincerely apologized, please be lenient. Let's forget this. Sit down. At the start of next month The President of America will visit. The exact date was decided, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ushiho has an announcment. Ushiho-kun・Yes! You... For a Foreighn Affairs Minister to not know English, that's a little uncommon. You know who to thank for that, right? I can't thank you enough, Chief Cabinet Secretary. alright, So act like it. Yes! This isn't going to work... It's fine, you're doing good. No, they'll find out eventually... Prime Minister, please... Domizo Pizza with 12 times cheese. Thank you. Everyone else, help yourselves. please. In an hour you have a meeting with Congresswoman Yamanishi For the K2 plan, I'll meet Onoda Construction's president Onoda Banba-san, take Prime Minister to the hotel, then please look after his wife. Well then, good luck. Tasty! Who am I meeting again? Congresswoman Yamanishi, leader of the opposition party. She was once a member of the same party as you. Why am I meeting her? I don't know. I want to know... That the Prime Minister helped a female reporter Is already big news. That's not like him. Prime Minister Kuroda is here. Thank you. I'll take my leave. No, don't go. I have arrangments. No, don't go, don't go. Enjoy! Hey, what do you think is happening? What? My husband! That sort of thing happened, but he said nothing. He probably forgot. No way! He even saw pictures. He's trying to break us mentally. That's like him. Let's forget about it. Even last night, he hugged me. He hasn't done that in ten years. scary... Sorry, I'll see you soon. Please. It must've been tough. Yeah. How are you feeling? Pretty fine. Okay. Good to hear. You don't have time, do you? Let's start. Right, let's start. What do you plan to do about the Minister of Health, Labor and Welfare? Shouldn't you fire him? I thought so but... You should also watch out for Tsurumaru-san. If you keep this up this will be his government I know but... You're the one who the public criticizes... Right? You should think about it Whether its the minister or anyone else it would be the same Fire him, fire! fire! Sorry About that matter, don't do it. If you admit it, you're done for... Yes here I can't understand unless you tell me all of it! The stone hit here? It's swelling up. Does it hurt? Well... What are you... What? You want to do it like that today? You don't need to do anything... No, wait,wait... Have you thought over that thing? Wait, wait. What are you doing? If we merge our parties... we'll make a stronger party. Hey, let's merge! I can't breath... Let's merge　・　Wait! Hey, Let's merge! ・ Wait! Merge families... Keisuke! Sorry... Excuse me... Wait... Keisuke! I'm going back. Is the Prime Minister doing well? Yeah, he's back at work. Really? Great! I was worried. In middle school... he took a soccer ball to the head... President...・ It was me... I tried to shoot... ・ President... but then his head sucked it in... President! The media is getting suspicious... It's me... This time, please don't directly contact Prime Minister. Contact me instead. Okay. Satoko number one. This time, we tried Flamenco. Life should be enjoyed. Until next time. Satoko number one! Okay, thank you. We'll start in five minutes. How was I? Verry cute. I'm hot. Can you turn up the AC? It's probably the lights. Someone's phone is ringing! I think that's yours. It's mine, sorry! Hello? About tonight... Madam, it's about time... Sorry, I have a performance. I'm hanging up... Right. It was my husband. Prime Minister? He invited me to dinner... What do you think? Isn't that nice? He's never done this before... Scarry... Excuse me, we're starting in three minutes... Yes. Madam, please go to the set. Sorry, I can't today. Really sorry. That's a problem. I'm mentally unable. Even if you say so... I'll leave it to you. Madam? Satoko number one. It's Banba-chan. It is... You did well. It was a live broadcast, I couldn't leave a hole. What program was that? It's a variety show your wife made for PR using tax money. Sounds like the Prime Minister's wife can do anything. She can't! Nonomiya-kun, put this in the safe. This money looks a little suspicious. It's the K2 plan. What is the K2 plan? You though it all up. Right. Please take this. They found the guy who threw the rock. Look, everyone. He was caught in one of Officer Koga's pictures This guy, Zoom in. A mean face. The person who helped the female journalist, is not anything like the Prime Minister we've known until now. It's probably just an act meant to raise his approval ratings Prime Minister, do you have a moment? Because he's not that type of person. Please. This is Cobra wine from the Vietnamese ambassador. It seems to have other ingredients, cheer up! Thank you... I was looking for you... Please have a seat. Wanibuchi-san, you're my wife's older brother, rihgt? Oh sorry... I don't act like an older brother... No, that's not what I mean. About our wedding... Would you like a drink? Then... water. Room temperature. Warm, okay.. Can you give me a general idea? I want to write an autobiography, I'm trying to sort out the past. It's fine to just tell me what you know. You want... me to tell you? Yes. My father was the Prime Minister, I was supposed to suceed him, but I wasn't good with politics, then you joined my father's gang, some things happened, then you married my sister, my father made you the heir. on his death bed, he threw my hand aside, and held your hand. I can't continue... Sorry, I didn't think it would be so emotional... You already know, how cruel! No... Yes. How long do you plan to hide it? Right now it is impossible for Kuroda-san to continue as Prime Minister He really is the worst Prime Minister. Why must I serve such an incompetent man. At this rate I should be Prime Minister. I've heard you always wanted to be a politician. I ignorantly thought I could change this country's government. In the end, I only learned how powerless I really am. Anyway, I at least have ideals unlike the current Prime Minister. About me and his wife? It's not like I'm really dating her. Really? I simply couldn't allow such an incompitant person to be Prime Minister. Then, about his wife? Right now, Prime Minister can do nothing without me. So I should take full advantage of this. I'll make him do as I want. That's the answer. Yes. Understood, I'll head there immediately. What? More trouble. That's enough for today. We can't go ・ It's already night so... If something happens to you we'll be in trouble. Then... Why didn't you protect me? We had no way to stop the rock. Furukori-san? Kuroda-san? Excuse me. What's with that outfit? You're late. That's rare for you. Security police were tailing me, I ran low on time, How did you lose them? I didn't. Koga-san? Koga-san? Go. you can get a drink. You're empty handed? Yes. You have some nerve. Didn't I tell you to bring that? No... No.... By that you mean... I made it clear. Your done for. No way...no. Then why didn't you bring the money? So if I pay, you'll give me that? Even me... If I don't get what should, I won't spread that around Is that square shaped? Is it a photograph? I'm leaving. Wait, how is it related to me? No, wait... What are you doing? ・ How am I related? Let go! What are you trying to ask? No... Nothing... Then here's a question. If you were to name that, what would you name it? I don't know. Thinking time. I'm not playing with you. Come on... "The afternoon love affair" So that's it... Are you going crazy? No wonder your wife cheats. You mean her? Who else? I want to see the photo Do you have it? What good will it do now... I really want to see it again. Didn't I give it to you? Did you... lose it? I lost it. How could you? What if someone finds it? Well, It should be somewhere in my room. You have no sense of caution! Let me see it... I don't have it. Do you have the negative? What year is this? It's on a memory stick. in my safe. So, you'll hand it over if a pay? I only work for money. You should know that best. By the way... How much did you say it costs? Hold on, I'm not renegotiating. Let's work it out. No, I won't lower the price. Just 300 thousand less... That barely cuts it. Fine. It's a present for your discharge. Then, what's the total? Count yourself. Are you stupid? That makes 19.97 million Yen. Okay, I'll make sure to bring it next time. What! What happened! That solves everything. Can he come home tonight? They agreed not to talk. Please. Let's go home. Dad didn't come? He doesn't know about this. Pease have tea when you get back. As much as you can. You need to wash off the alcohol smell. If you don't want to trouble your father, While he's in office tone down the night life. Is the car waiting outside? We can't use government vehicles, so we'll take a taxi. Maybe he wants to be a burden. Is that so... So Shirataki and Konjak noodles are the same thing. Yes I didn't know. Most people don't know. Yeah. Everyone let's eat up Shirataki He's a liar, it's obvious. He's pretending to like it now, It's too late. Okay, that's long enough. Everyone, that's all for today. Prime Minister, this way. Thank you, I learned a lot. Thank you very much. Hey, Isaka-san. I thought Shirataki... Is made with agar like Konjak noodles but that konjak noodles are made by cutting konjak... Or was it the opposite... I was wrong... Prime Minister Please have some tasty cherries. Please! I can't just come here... That's against the rules. Please go back! Plese try some, Prime Minister. I'm sorry, Prime Minister has plans so... Wait... ・ Please, Prime Minister. Then I'll just have one. Please. I love cherries ・ Please Prime Minister. Prime Minister ・ This is juicy... Thank you ・ Prime Minister! Then, just one more ・ Thank you. Thanks everyone, it was tasty. Don't do anything unnecessary! But... ・ You should consult us first. But I love cherries... If you do that, Other crowds will start to directly run up to you! Directly! Sorry... Next, at 10 o'clock You have a meeting with Defense Minister Omaezaki At 10:30, a courtesy visit to the daughter of Hakata seaweed salad. At 11:00, A meeting with National Security Director Nihonmatsu. At 12:00 ・ I'm sorry... Prime Minister... I can't continue afterall. Please wait...・ I can't do this anymore... I'm resigning. I think there are things only you can do, even with memory loss. People don't change easily, people can't easily give up what they've worked hard for, But for you, it is easy. You don't care about face or pride. Isn't this an opportunity? You can quit whenever you want. Just continue a little longer. I don't know the first thing about politics. You can start learning now. This is the first time I've seen you not talking like a farmer. It's also the first time, I've heard you voice your own opinion. Excuse me. Understood. Prime Minister They found the stone tosser. These days, computer blueprints are considered more convenient, Old school carpenters like us are slowly disappearing. What, is this plywood? I expected higher quality wood. You milk the citizens dry, but use cheap wood? That's not the point My business partner, Matsuji who worked in construction for 18 years, fell from the scaffolding. He damaged his back and couldn't work. He started receiving public assistance three years ago... Huh, Happy Tan? This is the best! A Happy Tan for a carpenter! The Prime Minister invited me, I at least expected baumkuchen. I'll go find one ・ It's fine... Please continue..・ Prime Minister... You tried to reduce public assistance funds again. Are you trying to kill Matsuji, you punk? The public assistance system still has many problems, From now on, we're starting to improve it. If you don't care, then fine. But, first, have you even once gone out to see the lives of people who are Truly suffering? Did you even try? That's what I'm trying to say! Did I? Don't ask her, moron! You're that type of person. Are you going to execute me? I don't care. I'm prepared. Nanjou-san, you're mistaken. I called you here to thank you. Thank's to you, I have a chance to be reborn. I took to heart what you said earlier. For hitting me with the rock, Thank you very much. That's how I feel. Yes, Prime Minister. I have a favor to ask... This... Who is it? Yanagi-sensei, my elementary school teacher. I hope he's still doing well... I'm going to re-study. He was a sociology expert. Even after you lost your memory, you still remember me? I somehow remember my childhood. Then do you remember, during class you would stare out the window without listening to me? This is yours, For some reason, I kept it. I'm returning it now. (Sociology, Year six Class one, Kuroda Keisuke) Nostalgic! Your approval ratings are pretty low, but it's nothing to worry about. In times like these, it would be the same for anyone. I had a bad attitude as a Prime Minister. It's fine, at least you have character. The people of this country, want to ostracize those who don't fit in. It's not a good sight. Then? Why did you call me here? Please teach me politics. I need to continue my life the Prime Minister. But I don't know how to carry out those duties. Please teach me from the beginning. Me too. So you forgot everything? No, it seems I never knew anything to begin with. Teaching the Prime Minister politics, As a teacher, there is no greater honor. I'll help you. Thank you very much. Please set aside three hours a week in my schedule. Understood. But there is a condition, Yes, teacher. This time, don't stare out the window. Separation of powers is... where power is divided and... Sorry for responding so late... About that political donation... I talked with the Prime Minister, and he was really happy about it. Is it over? ・ The first lesson is over. How many lessons does he have? It's very informative, I'm surprised how much I've forgotten Well, that's up to the president... That pharmaceutical company wants to donate. Don't worry, As soon as you log the statement of accounts, it's settled. Of course, I'll personally pick it up. Well then, excuse me. Didn't we refuse that donation? That was Prime Minister's idea. But...・ Excuse me. I never thought I would ever drink tea in the Prime Minister's office. I think it's a little too spacious. No, this is good. But when I think that this was Made with public funds... In the past, most children dreamed of being Prime Minister. But how many children do you think do so now? In every way,, the Prime Minister must be revered. How can the Prime Minister live a shabby lifestyle? The people should better understand the Prime Minister's life style. Right? Nozomi-chan? Right. That means the Prime Minister should also act more like a Prime Minister. I'm going home. Yes. Kuroda-kun. Yes? By losing your memory, you've escaped a cage. In other words, you're now the freest Prime Minister in history. I have high hopes for you. Until next time. Yes. Keisuke... wait... ・ Keisuke... Wait... wait! What is it! Let me be clear... clear... I want to end our relationship, so taday I came to... You're still mad about that? Yeah...that's right. It's about that. Didn't I apologize? Over and over... An apology can't solve this... We're the only the second largest party, just to survive, we must do whatever we can But you did that!? I was shocked. But please understand, To me you're everything, please forgive me. We won't skip congress proceedings anymore! Sorry. I'm no longer the me from before. What does that mean... I want to get back with my wife. You're not the person I know. I appreciate your intention, That you love me from your heart... That's enough. I'm not interested in heart. No? I fell for, the cowardly, money loving, manifestation of fame seeking power hungriness. How boring. Go home. Well... if you say... Take care of your wife. Welcome. I made you wait. That looks nice on you. Thank you. We'll wait out front. If you want, why not eat. There are open seets. We'll wait out front. You won't listen to an order? Order what you want. Excuse me, please seat them. Yes sir. This way please. Thank you for coming today. Prime Minister! Prime Minister! I made you wait! Welcome. Did you... Only your family is here today... Booked out? Like always. Prime Minister, this is on the house. I appreciate it but I can't... In private events, I don't want special treatment. Excuse me. I want some. Then I'll pay for it. Thank you. How many glasses of wine shall we prepare? Are you underage? You don't remember? Get one for him too... I'm underage. Carbonated water. Lord Prime Minister ordered us to bring you this. Prime Minister did? It's the end of the world. Thank you. Katsuhiko, let me ask you. What type of father have I been to you? Are you joking? I'm asking seriously. From your point of view, what type of father am I? The worst. How so? I can't respect you as a human. Specifically? Can I say it? Please. You only think about yourself, you only talk about money You don't care about your family, the people hate you, and I'm not Katsuhiko. You really forgot? Unbelievable... It's fine, at least you got the 'hiko' part right. I'm Atsuhiko. Of course I knew that, Atsuhiko. What I wanted to say to you today... is that I was reborn. I'm reborn. Until now I was a bad husban, father, and Prime Minister. But now it's different. I'm a new person. Then what's my name? ...Sadabiko? Whatever. No, memory isn't that fast... Does he know how old I am? Sorry. In elementary school I wanted to write "I revere my father." "One day, I'll become a politician" "And improve the country." But I never wrote it, unfortunately. As you gained power, your face became more wolf-like. Mom, this tastes good with bread. No, from now on I'll try to be a respectable father. I promise, Tonahiko... Atsuhiko. Atsuhiko. Don't overwork yourself. I'm serious, I'm really reborn, I'll forget everything up until now No way... I forgot! How can you forget? What is this? Scarry, you're scarry... What's your real aim? There is none, Natsuko. Satoko! Satoko... Natsuhiko! Atsuhiko ・ Right... Close. The 'Atsu' in my name means 'sincere.' He said. He named me... I think he wanted me to be his heir Is that so? There's no way. If you do succeed him? I won't Good morning. Prime Minister, I've been waiting. I want your help. There must be something only I can do. I'll do that. But I need your help. Isaka-san. I understand your feelings, But my answer is "No." Why ・ It's not that easy. You're overestimating the Prime Minister role. You can't change anything by yourself. It's useless. We can't know unless we try. For example? For example... Reducing consumption tax. We're raising it for a reason. For example... slightly raising large corporation tax, wouldn't that help? Well, it's amateur thinking but... The results of studying are showing. Amazing! Then let's do this... I want you to terminate the currently running K2 plan. If you do that, I'll consider it. That K2 plan is... A great project you designed to show off to your friend in the construction industry. What did I want to build? "K" stands for "National Diet Building" Right now, you're planning to build a second National Diet Building with a super bath house right next to the first one. No way... This project is already public. Can you stop that now? Isaka-san. Why did you ask for that? He should know that honesty alone won't change anyhting. Wait a second. That's why I'm returning this money. It's not enough? No, the price isn't the problem. What I asked you to do shouldn't be done I know that! Showing off is bad. Someone told you?? No, that's not it We can't go back now. The project already started! We don't need two Diet Buildings. Everyone thinks that. Calm down. Prime Minister, maybe we should rethink this. So many people are already involved. Even so, we should quit. Onoda-san. Don't call me that. I'm Onoda! I know, but we're canceling the plan! I don't want you to be a bad guy. Keisuke... What? Wait, stop... ・ Keisuke Let go. Your breath stinks. Did you remember? This isn't the first time you said that to me. You remembered. In middle school, when I was fighting with those Sanchuu guys, when I went to fight them alone you, and no one else, earnestly stopped me. You were full of lies, and the whole class hated you, but you got along well with me. You, held tightly onto my leg and said, "Onoda, I don't want you to be" "the bad guy anymore" I was serious. Both then and now. I'm awake now, the plan is canceled. Keisuke, you saved me again. Keisuke. Okay, okay. Let go...you sink... Welcome back. Welcome back. The K2 plan was canceled. Amazing! Let's make your dream government a reality. Even if we purify the government, the government can't function on only clean tactics. Please understand. That's false. You only know ideals, don't butt in. Even so, I want to try. I do think we can and should air out the government. And that is verry simple. This man is the source of all problems. As long as Chief Cabinet Secretary Tsurumaru is at the center of government, nothing will change He has too much power. We'll drag him down from his position. How? There are many ways. But everyone fears him. Even politicians and the press. But I'm not afraid. That's strength. Let's find a pawn. Someone devoted, with back bone, who hasn't lost any thing. Do you know the journalist, Furukori? Where did you hear that name? Well I... Thank you... I feel that he can help. Who's Furukori? He was a corrupt politician. Corrupt? I don't know if he has back bone, But I don't think he's lost anything. Let's look into it. First, Prime Minister. I want you to do something for me. Yes... Of course, if we make an enemy of Tsurumaru, he'll counter-attack. So we must make the first move. To not give him a chance to move, open a press conference, and apologize for current problems. Sorry. sorry. Huh? What's this about a press conference? No one told me. I have something to tell the people. You can't go around me. You can't open a press conference. Really? Then... I'll open a press conference, let's go. This way. Today, I have something to tell everyone. First, last month I called a female journalist a "chimpanzee in makeup." That day, by 'chimpanzee' I meant 'cute.' But I shouldn't have said it. I humbly apologize. Ma'am, I'm really sorry. Next, about the suspicion that I took a company vehicle to visit an S&M club. I went eight times. Sorry for lying. Also, the seamtroller voting Until now I relied on steamroller voting. I apologize for this too. What is he doing... I will no longer use crude tactics. From now on, I will carry out deliberations to the end. Let's make bills everyone can agree with. Is he stupid? The Prime Minister's sudden appology. Some call it an act of bravery, but is it really? Just an apology doesn't solve anything. If Prime Minister thinks it does, then he is seriously mistaken. I made you wait. Please, please. But there's nowhere to sit here. This way. Please. So? Why did you call me here? I want you to look into someone. Who? Chief Cabinet Secretary. That's a big deal. I'll pay. Why Tsurumaru? As long as he's around, this country can't move forward. You should know. Didn't you... Kiss up to Tsurumaru to get here? What happened? I lost... my memory. That? Shall we go somewhere else? Do you know what political journalists can't ask politicians? I'd like to know. "What do you think about political duty?" Newbies always want to ask that. But the answer is always: "It's a huge responsibility." I see. When I was young, my senpai chided me for this. Can I have this? Please... About that picture, I haven't found it yet. Idiot. But I'll definitely pay. But when I checked my accounts, I was surprised I had few extra funds. There should be secret funds. No, I don't want to use that. Can you wait a little longer? I'm making arrangements. You gave me a new job, Don't drag this out too long. Thank you. Then this money too? Yes, I scrapped this much together. I don't care where it comes from. As long as I get what I need. Weak. You were a political journalist? I thought one pen could change the government. At times, I found big news that could shake the world But in the end, I gave into pressure. I lost to money. The article never came out. I sold my soul as a journalist. And I kept selling it... But that's a different story. Do you know what it means to make an enemy of Tsurumaru? Of course. If your not careful, you'll lose your career. I have no regrets. That's good for you, but what about me? I'll lose my job as a free writer. One wrong move and I'm doomed. Even so, I ask for your help. Will you lend me a hand? Finally, a chance to change the government? Right? Let me be clear. Now, I have no interest in politics. I don't care who's controlling the government. What's important to me is if I can make money. Give me a week. I'll look around. Tomorrow 10:00 AM The President's private plane will arrive. America's first female President Susan Sentojames Narikawa Her grandfather was Japanese. She's unmarried. Everyone, keep this between us... I can't... It's fine, you can do it. I'm not confident. You know English, right? Language was your spcialty. English, French, German... Swahili... I can't, sorry... Let's do with 'Me too.' Welcome. It's an honor to meet you. You're pretty as always. That's a nice outfit. yo, President. yo，President. yo, President! yo，President! It's a pleasure to meet you again. Me too… You look healthy. I'll look out for the flying rocks. Me... Me too. I adore your kimono, Satoko. It is so beautiful. I want to wear it too. As beautiful as you yourself Madam President. I'm here to enjoy, and look forward to the golf tomorrow. Me too... You don't remember how to hold a club? You were a pro at golf. I don't remember anything. Let's call a pro to teach him. We need a pro golfer who's good at teaching, has tight lips, and favors Kuroda politics. Find him quickly. he probably doesen't exist. What about him? He played golf with Prime Minister. For now, try swinging it. He really doesn't remember anything. Please. Keep this a secret. It must have been tough. Waniguchi-san, we don't have time. Where should I start... Some people only slice or hook with special clubs like the driver, but for beginners the 'meet' ratio will be low because they don't hit well enough, and the ball doesn't fly far. I don't understand. The let's start with warm ups. The game is tomorrow... Golf is about hitting the ball. The thing about balls... I'll join you today... I look foreward to it... I don't understand his English. Whether it's golf or diplomacy, I take it seriously. I won't lose. I'm competitive against anyone. I'm worried about your health. If it gets bad tell someone. Your nice. Thanks for your concern. I'm not worried, don't get the wrong idea. I made you wait. You came too? Golf is about hitting the ball. The ball fallows the swing's path. I'll join the next party with the Foreign Affairs Minister Stay by the Prime Minister's side. Understood. Yes. Nice shot. I hear rare bird sounds. Your turn. You remember what's important, right? Winning? Right? I leave it to you. Well... Here I go. Swing already. Prime Minister. Wait... He's slow. What is he doing? Let me do it. There. Sorry. Okay... Tom...yam ...goong! Nice hit. Your interpreting is good... Ow... You broke your promise. You promised to meet me in America. Go to hell! I forgot to tell you... I'm the worst... You saw that... that fatal blow. It came back... Wasn't it closer? No, I think it was around here. You suck. Furukoni-san? It's your alignment. Your alignment was off, You didn't hit the ball straight on, so it trailed off. Understand? If you tell me like that... What are you doing? Work, idiot. Cabby? I was with Tsurumaru the whole time. Ah, good work. You found it. You should declare unplayable. 'Unplayable.' This is OK. In Japan, this distance is considered OK. Right, Yatsushiro? It's OK. So President gets a bogey. Is that right? That's not right. It's pretty far. Why don't you hit? Okay, Wife is next. Me? ・ Please. Wait, that's not right. If President's is OK, then mine and Wife's should also... Idiot. I'm fine with OK. No. What's wrong with you. Think about what you're doing. This game is getting serious. President, please do it one more time. What should I do? OK Wife, please. Is this okay? Take the hint. Don't interpret that! I think you're right. Yes. We're back. How was it? Did something happen? We had trouble at first, but we got through it. Good work. But there's a promblem. What? Apparently, last time, Prime Minister invited President to hand-made cooking. Hand made... And she wants to watch him make it. Is that what you say? Why ask me? I think you know already, right now, he can't cook at all. No. Anyway, go back and make dinner... I can't I plan to go home early today. I already promised President... to personally cook food. Then personally make it! Tonight I'm going to the Radium Hot Spring in Kenkourakuen. Oh, how fast. Everyone, look at that. Amazing. Amazing. Your husband is a first rate cook. Wife must be happy. Sorry for the wait , the main dish is here. This is Prime Minister's special, roasted duck. The sauce is made from the American cherries you sent. Thankyou, Keisuke. Please... Ducky... Ducky... What is the most important thing about cooking ducks? That is... Remembering to turn off the oven, and trying not to start a fire. This is very important. I shall remind the White House chef. I'm tired. What? Not now, Wife. What's wrong? This is an important event for Prime Minister. Hey, didn't he tell you something? He's scary recently. There's an undescirbable fear. It's probably fine. How often do people eat American cherries here? How much? I wonder... Well, many people like them. I prefer Japanese cherries. Americans would like to think more and more people are liking american cherries. Splendid. Sorry, President. But a unilateral enforcement of tariff reduction will not be tolerated. Prime Minister ・ It's fine, please interpret. It is my duty to protect this country's agriculture. to protect our cherries we can't completely eliminate the tariff. But I love American carries. Prime Minister... Maybe we should ask... What? ・ Tsurumaru-san... He told us to do as America says. I don't want to. She might lose the next election, If the President changes, we can rethink... Elections are hard to predict. you won't know until it's over. I understand the feeling. I can reconsider. Sorry. Then let's get to the main topic. This is the main topic. What are you planning? What do you mean? Foreign Affairs Minister told me everything. American... ・ American cherry. What's to gain from angering America? I just want to protect Japan's agriculture. Let's go, Prime Minister. Since when were you full of cheap humanitarianism. Listen, Continuing friendly relations with America Is beneficial to many large corporations. This is beneficial to the country, and thus many of the people. Have courage. Don't look for the people's favor. You already ruined our relation with America I'll have you take responsibility. After we played golf yesterday, I ate his cooking. It was very fun. But that's where the fun ended. After dinner, Prime Minister Kuroda refused a little trade deal I proposed. I can declare... It's time to find a new Prime Minister. Understood. Until now, this country has never had such a cocky, arrogant, and unpleasent Prime Minister. However... That is Amazing. to have an open relationship, this is how it should be. I was thrilled. So I'll say honestly, You're duck was overcooked and hard! No it wasn't! This country has a phrase: "speak frankly" We should speak frankly. If we do that, we can understand each other. This is the beginning of a new relationship between our countries. Prime Minister, Isn't that great? You're foreign affairs? I approve! Sorry, I acted on my own... That's fine, you're the Prime Minister. Act with confidence. Thank you. I won't allow it. He changed somehow. Because the stone hit him. Which hospital did he go to? I caught him by the tail. If this gets out, he's done for. Chief? What? I want to ask you something. My favorite food is boiled egg. What are your hopes for this country? I haven't thought about it. It's hard enough to live for myself. Why did you become a politician? I wanted to be a bullfighter, but I don't really want to kill bulls. "What do I want to do as a politician?" This is what beginner congressmen ask. To stay in politics at least a little longer. That's my motivation. Is that bad? Thank you. Think about it. Right now, Japan's government is functioning correctly. It's perfectly sound, really. The people don't wish for change. What's important is peace. Is that wrong? Stagnant water, however pure, will eventually sully. I think it's better than washing the citizens away in a flood. I'm happy to hear your opinion. Now I can full-heartedly fight against you. Let's see what you can do. Ow... Ow... Oh no... Sorry. You were here... I heard noise, so I thought you were a robber. Suga-san. The three principles of the constitution, Popular sovereignty, human rights and, Pacifism. Do you know them? The three delicacies of Chinese cuisine, Abalone, shark fin, and bird's nest. Do you know them? About that... I went with that, as you suggested. Sorry, I think you should stop it. We still have that after all, so there's no need for that. But... I need to talk to you later. Can you tell my secretary? I did. Is there a problem? It's about you. The doctor told me everything. So you lost your memory... Sorry for not telling you. I thought you were odd. How is it, doctor? His memory won't return, will it? It's hard to say. They won't return will they? Looks like they won't return. Prime Minister... It must be difficult to carry out your duties like this. Why not retire? Don't worry, my memories are back. I can carry out my duties. That's good to hear. Well, to be sure, please take a look at this. Question: Which official is this? Annoying, don't do that. Prime Minister... If you can't remember the names of officials, it's a problem. You can't continue as the Prime Minister. Minister of Defense. I remember. Minister Omaesaki. Correct. Next, who is this? Minister of Education Katou. Bingo. Question three... ・Nakakoshi Minister of Land, Infrastructure, Transportation and Tourism and Social Reform Minister Sayonara Bingo Question four. This is? I don't know. My dad. He sells vegetables. Prime Minister, we're running low on time. Then please excuse me, Chief Tsurumaru. Doctor... Memory is hard to understand. Excelent. I thought this might happen so I studied. You're skilled. Where was Tsurumaru Tuesday of last week. On Tuesday he was... He was eating with an old friend. An old friend... Was the person who met him here The treasurer Kantou Hanamarugumi? It would be hard to explain why he's eating with this guy. How long have you worked in this field? Sorry, but this Photo has been taken many times. It doesn't harm me. Then what about this one? This one can harm you. If the media gets this, your out. What do you want? I want you to resign from Chief Cabinet Secretary. It's better that resigning from Congress. Did Prime Minister hire you? I'll leave that to your imagination. I'll pay you double. You underestimate me. I only move on money, but I'm not a back-stabber. That would be bad for business. You can have the photo, as a momento. Nice face. I'm quitting as Chief Secretary. I'm tired. That's all. Okay, pick up the ball...look around... Throw it. What a cheater. No, I think his dealings with gangs is more severe. Unfortunately, he is the honorary President of the National Golf Association. He's been the Association's symbol for ten consecutive years. What's next? Reform the cabinet. Let's create an ideal cabinet without consulting anyone. I'll make preparations. Prime Minister. Make this a country revered by the world. That's not like you. I also pay taxes, at least let me ask that. It's about time for the press conference. Chief Cabinet Secretary. Is it fine for me to do this? Yes, I leave it to you. Yes. I won't give up that easily. Here's the beer. Cheers! Hold on... Yes? More guards? Just in case. From now on, expect enemies from any direction. Then... I want to add one more... The officer who caught me when I wondered around the city. I kept my promise. You're name? Yes... Officer Ozeki Heitarou of Cape Souya Wakkanai. Why Wakkanai? I was relocated last month. For keeping quiet? From now on, work by my side. It's an honor! Okay! (Madam Kuroda Satoko's love affair with the Prime Minister's Secretary) I didn't betray you. This is my job. I only move on... I know. You should have payed sooner. You were lazing around. Find Isaka-san. What happened? He left this and left. (Letter of Resignation) Isaka-san. I've been a burden for you... Sorry. She was fed up with me. You also hated me. It's all my responsibility. Sorry. Isaka-san. I need you. Please stay at my side. If that's what you want... You'll break up with my wife? I promise ・ She's my type. I'm sure she is. Isaka-san, tell him it wasn't serious. Shut up. He was just playing around. Shut up. Okay. Let's start the strategy meeting. What should we do? Can we turn this around? If we're not careful, our approval rating will drop. How do you feel about your wife? I want to get back with her. She's my type... I get it. Let's make a friend of public opinion. can you convey your feelings to your wife on camera? Yes, if I try. A press conference? No, that won't have enough impact. we need something impactful to win over public opinion. (Madam Satoko Cheeting) Yes, Prime Minister? I have a favor to ask. I read the news paper. I laughed. What are you two doing? It's embarassing. About that, I need your help. I brought Atsuhiko-kun back to the office He wanted to wait there. Isaka-san isn't answering the phone. I think you should forget about him. No. To begin with... What? Nothing... Please relex. There are plenty of reporters out back too. "To begin with?" I wanted to take you to a hotel, but looks like we shouldn't go out for now... What do you mean, "To begin with?" It seems he didn't love you to begin with. I'm going back. I'm going traveling. Madam.. I'm going alone. You can't go outside now... Suga-san. You've been here for a long time. Almost ten years. Don't you have some secret tunnel? Or an evacuation... I don't think so. She does? Huh? I didn't know... Where does it lead? The bird shop. Farewell. Help me with my luggage. Suga-san, sorry but But drive the car over to the bird shop. Take this. Your wife just left home. Live broadcast of national proceedings, debate with party leaders. Prime Minister, a few days ago, the adultery case with your wife was exposed. What do you think about the truth That Madam Satoko and your secratary commited adultery? You have poor crisis management. Is such a person suited to be Prime Minister? Please answer. Cabinet Prime Minister Kuroda. My wife did love another man, Blunt! But this is because My love was insufficient for her, The fault lies with me. How manly! Congresswoman Yamanishi. Will you lend me just a little of the Chichibu protesters' precious question time? There is something I must tell my whife Who's whaching this debate. Yamanishi Akane-kun Please keep it brief. How unprecedented... Cabinet Prime Minister Kuroda. Satoko... Sorry for making you feel lonely. Please forgive your disappointing husband. Let's forget this happened. Let's start over again. I love you. You're my type. Satoko... This country is important to me, But you're just as precious. If I can't even please you, There's no way I can please the people. I promise... Satoko. I'll never let you feel lonely again. And at the same time... I promise to never disappoint the people. Please believe me I won't run anymore, Please come home, Satoko. I love you. I love you. I need you. 偶愛泥 Je t'aime Ti amo Mahal kita Interesting, well done! Ich liebe dich. Since I first laid eyes on you, I was infatuated, Honestly, you're my type. I love you endlessly. Prime Minister will have to resign now. And he's making light of the debate.... No... This should raise his approval ratings. Contact Hanamaru. Have him prepare a sniper. You'll assassinate him? History repeats itself. Good work. Thank you. Prime Minister... Let's go, Prime Minister. I'm... Not running away. Will you join me? Of course. Prime Minister. Prime Minister Where is your wife now? Can you avoid breaking up? How do you feel that she left you? Please be quiet, everyone. Honey! Satoko... Prime Minister Everyone, thank you. I made you worry. My wife is back. I have been reborn. Please look forward to... The new Kuroda Keisuke. Watch out! It's him! After him! Catch him! Stop right there! We have something new on the Prime Minister. It came from the police station... One night last week, his son... Was taken into custody. For underage drinking. So? Spread this out to the media, We'll pay twice what we payed before. Sorry. I can't be such a scumbag. I agree. Two highballs, extra strong. My wife? She went to her room, she looked tired. Rest early today, good work. Prime Minister. Do you have time now? Of course. "My dream is to become a politician" "and the Prime Minister." That kid wrote that? You wrote this, Prime Minister. I did? "Everyone says I'm not cut out for politics." "Because I'm too docile." "But they don't know that" "I'm a bright person." "I can be bright at any time," "but If I do so suddenly," "everyone will be surprised." "But, if" "They see me hit in the head by a ball" "and I suddenly became bright" "they won't be surprised." "So one day, I want to be hit in the head by a ball" That's enough. It turned out in middle school, everyone saw me hit in head by a soccer ball. And then I became a politician. Were you acting since you were hit by the rock? No way. At first, I really did lose my memory. Then... When I recalled everything I could have continued as a bad Prime Minister but I wouldn't have this chance again. I think that's great. Banba-san. This is a national secret. Understood. The new approval rates came out. How are they? 2.8% It's slightly higher. How disappointing. The world won't let things go so smoothly. It doesn't matter. Whether they approve or not Let's make a world that can please everyone. Prime Minister, you can do it. Kuroda's politics, which has been hanging by a thread Is recently at the center of attention but we can't have high hopes. People don't change easily unless they lose their memory. Until tomorrow. Atsuhiko. Dad. What is it? No, nothing. I need to work a little more before coming home. Good night. Good night. Dad. One day, I also want to be the Prime Minister. 翻譯：葛亭筠 Adapted to English
