Cause y'all got to many house rules, you know what I mean? It's not like the club and shit, just don't wear your hat nigga. It's different, you come to somebody's house, its like "Aah, take of your shoes buddy." What the fuck is wrong wit you? You know my feet stink. Niggas don't wear socks unless we got on the flip flops. Some weird shit going on. I went to this one white lady's house, the bitch took my jacket, I was nervous. "Bitch took my jacket, my weeds in there." What the fuck is wrong with you bitch? It took me 40 minutes to find the hoe and my jacket. We're gonna need you done.

You ain't train this nigga to do shit. God damn lickin his own ass, nigga you got to fight. Live out in Compton niggas, this a Compton dog. Yo fuckin' up your dog with your jump. What the fuck is wrong with you? No, but I went to my white friend's house and I broke one of the fuckin' house rules. I hate the house rule shit. I didn't know. I said fuck it. You know what I mean? I put on socks just in case. So I jumped out the shit and the nigga dog was following me around the whole fuckin' times. I said, "This dog is followin a nigga around, this is bullshit." I didn't know he was hungry. So I gave that nigga some chicken. Here you go motherfucker, he tore that shit down. He swallowed that shit and started going "Help." I said, "Bitch. This nigga dog to ask for help." I said, "You gotta get the away from me nigga", don't blame this shit on me." White dude came down the stairs mad as fuck, "Oh my God. Did you fuckin' feed him?" I said "I didn't feed him", I might've dropped some chicken on the ground "and the nigga ate it." He said "He can't eat human." I said "I said chicken bitch, no human in the." What the fuck is wrong with you?" He said "He can't eat what we eat. Fucker." When white people call you fucker, you crossed a line. There's almost no going back. I said these niggas got my shoes. They said, "Do you understand this dog has fuckin' diabetes?" Level three, M.H. I don't know what the fuck that is. "But he had it. He's go corona." I said, "Well God Damn, how'd he get all this shit?" He said "He had it when we got him." Now only white people do shit like that. They wana rescue the dying motherfuckers. Come on now, this niggas on medicated food. How the fuck was I supposed to know?
