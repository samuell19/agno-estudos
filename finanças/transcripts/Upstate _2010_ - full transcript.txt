Esta muchacho no escucha. El no escucha. [birds chirping] You want a hair dryer? No, I don't need a hair dryer. [Dia] No? You don't need that? -I don't really use it. -[Dia] Oh, okay. [plastic bags rustling] Lipsticks. El color no es bueno para mi. ¿Lo quieres? Okay. [Dia speaks indistinctly] You need cranberries? For the road? Okay. And some cookies, too. They're gonna be good. [carton clatters] [Robert] Fuck me. -Don't fuck up my car. -Mm-hmm. -[Robert] I don't need that. -[chuckles] You gonna go see your boyfriend? He was never my boyfriend. Look at you. -What? What? -You look so ugly. -What do you mean? -What happened with you? ¿Que te pasa, chico? [Robert] Nothing's wrong, ma'am. Why do you start with me every morning? Every morning, it's something. Oh, my God. [Dia] Want a breakfast? -[Robert] I want--yeah, yeah. -[Dia] Okay.

Hey. [man] How are you? How was your drive? Good. You? -Nice ride. [laughs] -[woman] Yeah. They let you drive her in the shop? [both laugh] I made good time, though. -[laughs] -[chuckles] [keys jangling softly] [man] Hey, sweetie! [zipper whirs] Look who I found. [singsong voice] It's Liz! -[woman] Hi! -Hi. It's so great to finally meet you! Thank you for taking the trip up. -No, thank you. -Yay, she made it! Whoo-hoo! -Oh, this is for you. -Oh, no, no. -What? -No, it's nothing. Come on. [all chuckle] [indistinct] -Cute. -[man] Geez. Whoa. -It's so fancy. -Yeah, it's fancy. [chuckles] [paper rustling] Oh, wow. Wow, that's really beautiful. Thank you. -It's cute. -Oh, it's so sweet. -Oh, and... -She loves it. I love it. -That's for you. -Whoa. Whoa! An appropriate offering. I'm pleased. Wow, you must be starving after your trip. -You hungry? -Yeah. -Yeah? -Yeah. Good, good, 'cause we're gonna have a great meal. -So, uh, here. -Awesome. I'll take this, and she probably wants to freshen up. -You need to freshen up? -Wow. -Freshen up? -[both laugh] [water running] [humming melody] -[Liz] Really? -[man] Yeah. [Liz] What kind of band is this? [man] It's, uh-- it's like Stomp. [Liz] What? [laughs] Aww. -[man] Yeah. -[Liz] Sounds pretty good. [man] Yeah, well, the kids-- the local... [dishes clanking] [both laughing] [man] This is fun. [sighs contentedly] [crickets chirping] -Does she need help? -Oh, no, she's fine. [Liz] I feel bad. I feel like we should help. No, no, it's good. Don't worry. -Yeah, maybe I should help. -[Liz] Maybe you should help. Yeah... I'll help. [door closes softly] [indistinct chatter] [dishes clank] [door opens] [door slams] Hello! There you go. [woman] Wow. [laughs] [man] Oui, oui. -Madame. -[woman] Thank you. [Liz] Thanks. -It's so quiet. -I know. At first, I was totally freaked out by it, but after a while, you get used to it. [Liz] You guys really live up here year-round? [woman] Mm, it's been two years now. -[Liz] Living the dream. -Yeah. [Liz] So, how did you guys meet anyway? -[woman] Oh. -[chuckles] [laughs] Uh, we, uh... we met in the desert. Wow. Really? We met at Burning Man. -Burning Man? -[couple laughs] Burning Man. You went to Burning Man. Yeah. I went with Don. Don, right. [man] It's amazing, really. It's-- it's-- it-- it's just so beautiful. You're-- you're out in this-- in this incredible heat. And, um, it's like this alien landscape where this makeshift city has erupted. It's-- there's really something about it. -Okay. -[woman] Stevie got lost. He walked right into my camp. So... Steve says you guys make dolls. [woman] We don't actually make them. We have them made in South America. They're these traditional folk figurines. They're just... [mumbles] Yeah, I know it sounds ridiculous, but, um... they're-- people love them. And, um, they're-- they're-- they're cool, really. They're-- they're really surreal-looking. And we sell them mostly on the Internet and some stores and boutiques. [Steve] They love them in the fancy boutiques. They do, in those fancy boutiques. And, you know, we-- we import other stuff, too. And, you know, we really get to work with the locals and feel like you're making a difference in a small-- Well, plus the twice yearly trips to South America. That's not bad either. Yeah, but I mean, it's nothing like what you do. [woman] Oh, my God, your work, it sounds-- Fuck! How are you? How's the center? Actually taking a little bit of a break, a little breather. [Steve] Totally. -What have you been up to? -Mm. Nothing much, really. [Steve] Who have you heard from? I never hear much of anything up here. -Hmm. -So, uh, what's up with Ariel? You know, I haven't really seen her recently. [Steve] And Mitch? Mm. [Steve] Going through a misanthropic phase? How's your mother? She, um... she died last year. [woman] Oh, my-- oh. I'm so sorry. You're too young to lose a parent. Thanks. I don't know what I'm eating, but this is delicious. [woman laughs] Thank you. It's fried quinoa and some parsley and dried cherries. The parsley is from my garden. [Liz] Garden. Wow. [crickets chirping] [door creaks] I'm gonna go check on the soup. Do you need anything? -No, I'm good. -[woman] Okay. I'll be right back. [door creaks, shuts] She seems...different. She seems strange. She seem strange to you? She seems fine. You seem strange. You're the one that's on the floor. [Steve] Fuck. She doesn't call me when her mother dies? You've just grown apart. Give it some time. You'll reconnect. It'll be fine. Okay, Mom. Oh! Jesus. People change, you know. Maybe you changed. Yeah, maybe. She's probably just... mm, going through a funk. -A funk? -[woman] Yeah, a funk. -[laughs] -[woman] What? Sorry I can't be more articulate. [both laugh] Aah! Oh! [woman giggling in distance] [Abba's "Chiquitita" playing in distance] [dishes clinking] Let me help you. Oh, no, no, I've got it. You two talk. -Are you sure? -[woman] Yeah. [door creaks] The house is beautiful. This is the living room. Obviously, I decorated everything myself. [chuckles] Really? [Steve] Mm-hmm. Can't you tell? -Mm... -[Steve] It's all me. Somehow, I doubt that. [chuckles] What's this? Oh, look, it opens. Oh, don't go in there. You won't come back. Hmm. What is this, one of those priest scarf things? [Steve] Yeah, that's a priest scarf thing. I do a little priesting in town. [Liz] Oh, yeah? Yeah. I've married a few people. I can marry you one day. So...this is a guest room. Yeah, my bag's here. Yeah, magic. Thanks. So, um, you can hang out here if you need a minute, or you can follow me. No, I'm good. Okay. I'm the doll king. They do my bidding now, you know? Can I touch 'em? Wow. You've seen the bathroom already. [Liz] Yep, got the bathroom. It's a little-- little tight. [chuckles] Oh, our bedroom-- Sylvia and mine-- is up here. -You know, I don't need to-- -[Steve] What? I don't need to go up there. It's okay. I don't... [Steve] Sure. [Liz] Looks like you're gonna have a little trouble with the stairs. [Steve] Yeah. [water splashing] [dishes clinking] [Steve] And...that completes our tour. These weren't here yesterday. Hm. Mm. You got to try this. [chuckles] -Seriously. -Mm. -No? -Mm-mm. Okay. -Here you go. -Thanks. Sylvia made this pillow herself. -[Sylvia] Oh. -[Steve] Oh. So what do you think you want to do tomorrow? Because we hadn't planned out tomorrow, every single second. Well, okay, maybe she has her own ideas. Well, what do you say, Liz? Do you have your own ideas? Uh, no. I mean, whatever you guys have planned is great. I'm easy. [Steve] Yeah, she's easy. You're also far away. [Sylvia] Um... So, we were thinking that-- Whoa, we-- we were thinking? What were we thinking? We were thinking that maybe she-- We're Borg, you know? Hive mind. That's what happens when you get married. Yeah. [laughs] Okay. I was thinking-- I was thinking that, possibly-- that you might want to go to the Shaker Museum. Maybe check it out. Really cool. Yeah, no, that sounds great. -Yeah. -Oh, my God. Liz. You've got to hear this song. Oh, no. Oh, babe, not tonight. [Steve] Just-- hey, now, Liz is gonna love this song. -It's late. -[Steve] It's a great album. -Babe. -[Steve] Just one song. [rock music plays loudly] It's great, right? [music stops] [grunts] [birds chirping] [birds continue chirping] What? -[rustling] -[clanking] [thuds] [birds chirping] -Good morning! -Good morning. -Want some coffee? -Yeah. [Sylvia] How'd you sleep? Great, thanks. [liquid pouring] [dish clanks] Hi. Good morning. [birds chirping] [woman] Are you free as you are? Are you in, any degree, bound by your appetites, your passions, your self-will? Are you at all in bondage to the opinion of your neighbors, to the customs and notions of society, however harmful or absurd? These do not trammel the true Shaker. [women singing] [woman 2] I think that mother believed that despite the sort of body and the sort of physical and mental makeup with which we might be born, everyone was called to be mother, father, brother, sister to everyone else. Those who were men would have to show compassion and tenderness of women. Those who were women, physically speaking, would often have to take upon themselves roles of dominance, of power, of strength. One had to be, within the Shaker family, all things to all men.

[Steve] Inside. Okay. -Oh, like Africa. -Is that what that is? [Liz] Yeah, that's what it looks like. -No, look, he's going inside. -Oh, nice. [Steve laughs] I want a giraffe coming into my window.

They're so hungry. I love them. Can we get one? Can we get one? Please? [man] Hey, you know, he's just trying to look down your shirt. I know. He lured you with those soulful bedroom eyes. [Liz laughs] Don't believe a word that Sam tells you, all right? He's a dog. -Oh, yeah? -[man] Yeah. -You two are friends? -Yeah, Sam and I go way back. -[Liz] Really? -Yeah. -Yeah, just me and him. -[Liz laughs] I'm just kidding. His name's not Sam. It's Phil. And I'm --I'm Paul, by the way. -Hey. -[Paul] Hey. I'm Liz. He's gonna sing Beatles songs or something. Oh, look, look, I think he's singing. You hear that? Yeah. So...you're telling me Sam -- I mean, Phil's-- taken? [Paul] I'm afraid so. Can I buy you a root-beer float as a consolation prize? I don't need your charity. [Paul] Aw, it wouldn't be like that. Hey! Hey. Oh, this is, uh, Paul. Hi. Uh, P-- Paul raises, uh, alpacas. Oh, wow. [Steve] I think we're gonna go. Uh, ready? [Liz] Yeah, yeah, totally. Let's go. Okay. Bye. Nice to meet you. -And Phil. -[Paul] Yeah. Definitely. Way to blow it, Phil. [boy] Why-- why do you have to jump onto the-- your-- your brother? Why? Why? Okay? That is not good. He is-- he doesn't do anything to you, when you jump on him for no reason, for enjoyment. And you just want to get over the fence to-- to go to your friend or go to talk to them. But why? Why? This is my favorite little boy. [indistinct chatter] [brushing] -[bell ringing] -[laughter] [man] Hey, hey, hey! Come here. -Alfredo! -[woman] Oops! Ready? Let's go. -[bell rings] -Go, go, go, go, go. [chatter, squealing] [woman] Is he coming? [whimsical music playing from ride] [laughing] -[whines] -No, seriously, it's fine. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Look, it's so beautiful, you got to-- -you have to open your eyes. -[Liz whines] [Steve] Come on, what is it? You're afraid? We're getting off, right? We're getting off? No, no, no, no. We're gonna go around again. -Are we down? No! -Again. Again. -God! -Oh, wow, geez. -This is unbelievable. -[Liz] No! -[Steve] Open them. -No, no, no. Open them. All right. I'm pulling them off. -Stop, Steve, stop! -Open your eyes! Huh? [laughing] Oh, my God! Oh, my God! All right, stop. I can't see it, I can't see it. [both laughing] Stop! I can't believe you got me on here! -This is awesome. -[clicking] Aah! What just happened? -What just happened? -No, no, it's perfectly natural. I think sometimes they stop them because, you know, they've got to work on them a little bit. -Let's see. -Um... Yeah, he's working on it. He's just-- he's just screwing and tightening some things. -Shut up! -[both laugh] No, no, this thing was probably built around 1970, so... Oh, God. Steve, I hate your guts. And they take it apart and they, like... -Shut up! -...back it up and put it... -Shut up! -So, you know, like, they pretty much always get it right, though, as far as I know. Oh, man, I'm gonna get you for this one. Oh, you know, we're good. Assuming we live through this, that's fine. Shut up already! [Liz gasps] [Steve] See? [laughs] [engine starts] -[coughs] -Oh, no! -Here. -[Liz retches] I'm okay. -[retches] -Holy whales' tails. [Steve laughs] Aw, it's okay. [Liz whimpers] [clatter] Hey, do you want some tea or anything, just to give your stomach a little...? -[Liz] No. -Ginger? [Liz] I think I'm just gonna hit the sack. -Yeah? -[Liz] Yeah. Okay, well, you have a good night. [Liz] Yeah, thanks. If you need anything, just let me know. [Steve] Night. Hey, babe, we got to get some rest tomorrow for the big hike. [crickets chirping] [birds chirping] [mechanical whirring] [wings fluttering] It's, like, soulless. [Liz gasps] It's scared. It looks like a-- they're like dinosaurs, you know? -[wings fluttering] -[thud] Aah! This way-- aah! -[Liz] No, no, no, no. -[Sylvia] Take a towel... [Steve] What? Take it and do what? [Liz] Just... [Steve] I'm not gonna -- I'm not gonna touch it. [Liz] Hug it! Hello. [Steve] Sure, sure. We'd be happy to. Of course. I totally dig. They'll go out first thing Monday morning. Okay, cool. I'll, uh-- I'll shoot you a message then. All right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right, I'll, uh-- I'll talk to you then. Bye. -Emergency doll situation? -Yeah. The doll business stops for no man. [chuckles] [Steve] Sleep okay? Yes. [Steve] Feel like a hike? Yeah, let's do this. [door creaks] Liz, I have an extra pair of boots if you need them. -No, I'm good. -Okay. Thanks, though. [traffic passing] [no audible dialogue] [birds chirping] [Liz] Do you think we'll see some deer or something? [Steve] I don't know. Dearly hope so. [Liz] Have you seen them? -[Steve] No. -[Liz] No? Bears? Do you see bears? [wind blowing softly] [water running] [Liz] Wow. [Steve] You can say that again. Wow. [Steve chuckles softly] I always liked that about you. Liked what? [Steve] That you always said it again. It's one of my more winning qualities. I've missed you. [Liz] Me, too. Yeah? Of course. [footsteps] [leaves crackling] [Steve] I've missed you. [Liz] Me, too. -[Steve] Yeah? -[Liz] Of course. It hasn't felt that way. I mean, this weekend's been great. I don't mean that, just... in general. Where the fuck have you been? I kind of dropped out. I-- I get that, and I understand. Really, and I feel like such an asshole. Your mother died. I totally get that. I mean, I don't get that. I can't understand what-- what you must be going through or...what you're feeling. Why didn't you call me? I would have been there for you. I want to be there for you. [leaves crackling] I was embarrassed, 'cause I didn't go to the wedding. I didn't even-- didn't even RSVP to the wedding. [Steve] It's me. [Liz] I know. [Liz] How do you reconcile death when you don't believe in God? You don't believe in anything. Someone just turns out the light. That's it. [water pattering] [water running] [water running] Sylvia! Sylvia! [leaves rustling] There you are. [breathing heavily] I was getting worried. We should... We should head in. It's getting dark. Liz is waiting by the car. Oh, well, you don't want to keep her waiting, now, do you? [Steve] Here. Let me help you up. Hey... Come on. I'm sorry. I know. I know. We were just... catching up. And I'm sorry I've... I've been a little distant this weekend. Liz and I have this thing. Yeah, you have this thing. No, listen. I don't need to listen. I see. You think I haven't, since day one? -See? -You think I don't see-- See what? It's late. I'm not gonna get into this right now. We better go. See what? I don't love her. I'm not in love with her. -Not really, n-- not like that. -Jesus Christ. Fuck! This isn't coming out right. Okay, look, you've-- you've never imagined-- -What? -You... -I'm the only-- -What are you saying? You are my husband, I love you, we're married. I love you, too. And I don't want anything to change. Well, then you better stop talking right about now. No, no. [insects chirping] -[knock on door] -[Sylvia] Hey, it's me. Um... Hi. I'm just changing. [Sylvia] Can I come in? Sure. Just gonna put my shirt on. -I should check you for ticks. -What? Deer ticks. We have a lot of them. You can catch Lyme disease. It's really serious. I should check you. -Uh, I can check myself. -No, it's better if I do it. It'll only take a second. Oh. Mm. [pats] Take your pants off. [chuckles softly] [sniffles] I, uh... I wanted to have that feeling, you know? Like you're in a room with someone and you're not talking or saying anything, but... you just know. [sniffles] Not that they love you, but they really know who you are. [sniffles] I think I just got confused. [water splashing] [spout clicks, water stops] [water splashing] [Liz chuckles] We had sex once. Why don't you guys have kids? We tried. I had a few miscarriages. That's what happens when you get old. You got to have your first kid by 35. They don't tell you that. Who knows, maybe we'll adopt. Gonna go Asian or Eastern European? What's wrong with South American? [Liz chuckles] Not a damn thing. We'll see. Plus, you have experience importing from that region. Oh! Nice one. [laughs] -You should freeze your eggs. -[Liz] What?! Seriously, think about it. You should. I don't know. I don't think I'd be a very good parent. Man, I need a bathtub. Shit dreams are made of. [both laugh] It was just once? Yeah. It was a long time ago. I like being old. Besides the miscarriages. -You're not old, Sylvia. -Relatively. When you're old... you start liking yourself. I wanna like myself. [Sylvia] You will. Hungry? Sorry to pull you out. [insects chirping] [Liz] Who eats their pizza with a fork? You do. [both laugh] [Steve] You better take it fast 'cause it... -[Sylvia] Okay. -[Steve] All right. [bottle clanks] -[Steve] You need to drink. -[Sylvia] Oh, yeah? -I am, I am! -The power of Christ compel... [Steve and Liz laughing] I'm eating a carrot and smoking a joint. -That's kind of gross. -You guys, I didn't-- I wanted to tell you about the other nun. [Liz] What? The one that I gave a nervous breakdown to. That's what she gets for being so right about everything. -"Nun" too soon. -[Sylvia] Yeah. Yeah, yeah. No, well, seriously, she taught typing, and we would, like, stick pencils in the doorknobs and break them off, break them off, break them off. [Steve and Sylvia laugh] [both laughing] [Liz] We just got it. We should go for a walk. I think that's a really bad idea. -Yeah, that's a horrible idea. -[Steve] No, no. We've got to-- we've got to get the blood moving. [Sylvia laughs] I'm pretty sure my blood is moving all the time. It's kind of upsetting if you think about it. What if we tried to be very still? -[howling] -Oh, God! What was that? [overlapping chatter] [all laughing] -Oh... -[Steve] You all right? It's probably just the Ionics' dog. Oh, yeah, it makes this weird sound because they put this collar on it that shocks it every time it barks 'cause it makes these horrible growling noises. Anyone want an omelette? I want to make an omelette. How can you possibly be hungry? What are you gonna put in the omelette, babe? With some peas. -Peas in an omelette? -[Sylvia] Yeah! Why not? Experimental omelette! Yeah! [Steve] Um, peas and hot sauce. Is Apple peanut butter weird to put in an omelette? [Steve] No, I don't think so. This is our omelette, babe. We're making this how we want it. -[Sylvia] Here. -[Steve] Thank you. -What you chopping there? -[dog howling] [Sylvia] Shallots. Muy good. [Steve] Okay. Oh-ho-ho, yeah. Listen to that sizzle. -[chuckles] -[chopping] [Sylvia] Is that a good thing? I think we should turn the heat down. Oh! I like the way you think. Okay. This is looking well-ordered here. -Peas. -Get that in there. And let's, um-- let's get focused here, though, 'cause I think this is-- this is really in a good place right now. Okay. I think it's good. -All right. -[Sylvia] Yeah? [Steve] And here we go. I know. This is a terrible omelette. It's okay. We will rebuild. We have to help that dog. What dog? The Ionics' dog? -[Steve] Oh, no. -Oh, yeah. Look, I assure you, the next time we're in town, I will give them a very stern look. We won't send them a holiday card. No holiday card. We send out holiday cards? We have to destroy that collar. It's an abomination. Well, you know what this is, is a shock. It's really not that bad. No, I-- I can't get that sound out of my head. [Steve] Keep low, keep quiet. Let's go. [Steve speaks indistinctly] [Liz] Wait. Where are we going? Wait. -[Sylvia] This way. -[Liz] Wait. Where are you going? Hey! -[giggling] -Shh! [dog whining] [laughs] -Hi! See? [Laughing] -What's that? -Oh, my God. -Shh. [Sylvia laughing] -[dog whines] -[Liz speaks indistinctly] [Liz] Oh, my God. Go! Go, go, go, go. [dog barking] [both giggling] Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God. Go! Go, go. Go. [dish clanks] [giggling continues] -Oh! -Why are we sitting in the dark? -[Steve] Shh! -[Sylvia laughs] [Steve] I'm gonna put this collar on you. [Liz] Give me that thing. [dog barking in distance] Woof! [Sylvia laughing] -[imitates dog barking] -[Steve] God. [Liz] That doesn't work. Here, you try it. [Sylvia inhales deeply] [barks loudly] [Liz laughs] [overlapping chatter] [Liz] Let me try. Try this one. Yip, yip, yip, yip! [Steve] God, that fucking noise. -[Liz] What noise? -[Steve] You don't hear that? High-pitched screeching noise? [Sylvia] Oh, my God. I know what this is. This doesn't shock you. If you bark, it makes a high-pitched screeching noise that only dogs can hear. -[Liz] Steve heard it. -[Sylvia] I know! [Liz laughs] [Steve] What are you laughing about? [both laughing] [dog barking in distance] [Liz] Oh, my God, that dog barks a lot. [Sylvia] We have to go and put this collar back on him. -No. No. -[Liz] No, I totally agree. -[Steve] No. -[Liz] Yeah. You. You were the one just crying about the poor dog. [Liz] Well, I'm a poor drunk. What can I say? Well, you guys have fun. I'm staying here. [Sylvia] We're out of omelette. What are we gonna do? [Liz] I don't know. Let me see that. [Sylvia] Veggie dogs. [Liz] Veggie dogs? Will it go for that? [Sylvia] Well, it ate that fucking omelette. [Steve] Don't insult my omelette. [Sylvia] I don't... Um, Cap'n Crunch! [Liz] Oh, no, that'll scratch up its mouth. [Sylvia] Oh. -[laughs] -[Liz] What? -What are you laughing at? -[Sylvia] Jackpot. [Liz] What is that? [Sylvia] I think it actually came from the Ionics! [both laughing] Okay. Let's go, let's go. Okay. Do you have the collar? [laughs] The collar? -Give me the collar! -Let's go. [Liz] Go, go, go. Here, you take this. [both laughing] [birds chirping] [sighs] Oh, God. [groans] [silverware clinking] Sorry. Did I wake you? No, booze wore off. Ditto. You want help? -Dry? -Mm. [birds chirping] [speaks indistinctly] -[glass shatters] -Fuck! Fuck. Sylvia will love that. Remember when you lived with Iris? [chuckles] Yeah. Yeah, and whenever she would break something... -Just leave a note... -...she wouldn't pick it up. -...that said "Broken glass." -'Cause she was amazing. Picking it up would have been so much more difficult. I know. God, and whenever she would buy toilet paper, she would, like... Invoice you for, like, 33 cents. Unbelievable. [both sigh] -[laughs] -She was a magical woman. Sometimes I wonder if she ever really existed at all. Are you suggesting that Iris was a figment of our imaginations? Maybe she existed on the astral plane. You were tapping into some pretty heavy shit back then. [both chuckle] I don't know, she had a right to be mad at us. You were always there. Yeah, yeah. She probably hated us. Me. Oh, well. I do love Sylvia. She's pretty awesome. [chuckles softly] Burning Man, huh? -Ah! -[laughs] I wasn't gonna get off easy on that one. [laughs] No, seriously, I want to know, like, were you dancing around a bonfire, like, hula-hooping while juggling glow sticks or...? Ha, ha. I'm curious! What was Mad Max like in person? You've been seriously misinformed. But there isa Thunderdome. There is! I read it on the Internet, man. [loud rumbling] [birds chirping] [distant chatter, laughter] [water splashing] [indistinct chatter continues] -They go into the water. -Okay. -You can take off any stems. -Okay. Because the stems will puncture the skin, and once the skin is punctured, you can't sell it as a first and you may not be able to sell it as a second for sauce. What is the difference, first and second? -Well, this, because it's so small... -Uh-huh. ...But also because it has a bad spot, it's a second. [Liz] Now, what about this here? -[woman] That's a second. -[Liz] Okay. [woman] That's where it laid against the ground, and that's where it's gonna start to rot first. If the weather continues to stay as cold as it is, we won't have many more tomatoes. [Liz] Mm-hmm. Oh, really? [woman] They have to have sun to ripen. And they don't like the cool nights. And remember, the animals like their fair share. Mm. [woman] So you have every creature under the sun... trying to eat their fill, also. But yeah. And that's it. That's what it's all about. Cool. And on a nice day like today, when it's hot, playing in the water is fun. It is. Thank you.
