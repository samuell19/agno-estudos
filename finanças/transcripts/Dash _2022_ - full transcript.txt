[beep] [static] [fanfare music] [telephone ring] [telephone ring] MILLY: Sorry, I'm not here. [beep] WOMAN: Hey, I just wanted to talk. One of these days, maybe you will, too. [nervous laugh] I, um, I know you have a lot going through your head right now. I think we all do. And I know this isn't exactly the curve ball you were expecting-- shit, more like a cannon ball, really, but I just want you to know that you're not alone. I'm scared shitless. I just can't stop wondering if-- if we're doing the right thing here, you know? I know you said this is for the best, but-- I just can't justify it. I don't know. I guess what I'm really trying to say is, the silver lining to this whole mess is that I guess I think I love you. KALLI: Aww! WOMAN: So, um, yeah. I know you're working or whatever, but call me when you get a chance. Just want to make sure we're still good for tonight. See you soon. [beeping] The "L" word, huh? Yeah. Hormones. Hormones. Hormones, my dick, man, she digs ya! This? This is hormones. Little wobbly down there, huh? I know, I know. I'm sorry. You don't gotta be sorry to me, man. My arm's cramping like a motherfucker. Hmm. So you're a quitter now, huh? I guess so. Huh. I'm sorry, its... I just-- I mean, do you think she really meant that? Or is she just saying that because-- and I barely even know her. I don't know, it's just... I'm sorry. You don't want to hear this crap. I just... I just want her to be happy. Worst case of ED I'd ever seen. - I don't have ED, I just... -Emotional dependency. Emotional dependency. I don't know which one's worse. Two peas in a shitty pod, huh? Ain't the pea-pod that's shitty, my man, it's the roots. Well, I've got to get back home. Wait, wait. You're leaving? Wh... why? I got so much stuff I have to do before tomorrow. Can you please just hang? Just for a second, please? Just this once? - I... I can't. -Um, ah, how's D? Is he ready for the big day tomorrow? Want to see what the little shithead did this morning? No! Is that his cake for tomorrow? Yep. What? He ate that much? Are you sure it wasn't Lola? Lola was at the vet this morning, remember? Just... wait, check it. - Ooh, is that-- - Puke? Yep. Bet yer ass it is. A big ol' pile of puke right in the middle of his bed. Little fucker tried to make his bed on top of the pile of puke, just to hide it. I spent all afternoon cleaning that shit up. Oh! The smell. [gags] If I tell you something, you promise you won't get pissed? It smelled a little puke-y when you got in the car just now. Oh, motherfucker! And you weren't even gonna say nothing? I didn't want to be rude! Come on, man! Huh! I smell like puke, my whole entire apartment smells like puke. Got my entire family coming over tomorrow, it's just gonna be one giant fucking puke-fest, with no goddamned birthday cake! Fuck. Mother fucking, mother of the year. Strange being a parent. John says 'hi' to me the wrong way and I just wanna fucking castrate him. And this dude pukes all over my shit. I just can't wait to get home and see him. Guess that's love, huh? Or ED. [laughs] Oh, motherfucker! It's on... it's on me! Fuck! My whole fucking car's gonna smell like fucking milk puke! I got something. - God damn! - Wait one second, wait. Fuck! Fuckin' shit. Here. Here, here. It's not the most chic, but, you know, at least your car won't smell like a dairy dumpster. Heh-- I don't know why you're cracking jokes, dude, you still let me tug away at that shit, smelling like this. I'll give it a-- oh wait, I'll wash it and I'll give it back to you tomorrow. Ah, yeah, don't worry about it. Oh, uh, there's something else I want you to have here. Sorry I didn't have time to wrap it. I had to go to, like, three stores before I fo... This is the one he wanted, right? The Purple Plower? I thought you said that-- Yeah. Thanks. That... he's gonna love it. Ha. Is this hug gonna cost me an extra five bucks? Hmm. [laughs] [helicopter flies overhead] Still want to do this? It ain't too late, you know. Yeah, it is. It's about nine months too late. - Well, then, do you got cash? - Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Here. [whispers] Thanks... Oh, and uh I still want to pay-- Oh, shit! What the hell are you doing, man?! - I'm sorry. Oopsie-- - No! Fuck! No! Okay, okay, okay. Shit, calm down, man! And you don't have to pay me for the... that. No no, don't be silly. I still-- I got it. I got it. I normally don't do that sort of thing, so just accept it before I take it back. Look, there's-- there's other ways of getting the money, you know. This is like a zero sum business that you're fucking with. Look, I'm in no business to be giving advice. Nor should anyone listen to a goddamned thing that I have to say, but I will say this. All your actions have consequences, man. Just because you can't see 'em doesn't mean that they're not fucking shit up elsewhere. Just like the shitty roots to your shitty pea-pod. Just don't fix that shit at the roots, it'll just... keep on spreading. Kinda like that puke smell, huh? That's why I changed. Why I gotta go. Good luck, pal. - See you next week? - I hope not. Have fun tomorrow at the-- [door slams] [sighs] [music] [radio clicks on] DJ: As we continue to rock at KBILLY Bonanza with another tune from Bobby Day, only on K-B-I-L-L-Y, the home of rock. ♪ ['Rockin' Robin' by Bobby Day] ♪ [phone app dings] PATTY: Say you're sorry. BOB: No, I will not say I'm sorry, because, A.) I'm not fucking sorry, and B.) I'm not sorry that I'm not fucking sorry. Ow! and C.) you should be-- and C.) looking for Beaux? Yeah. And C.) you should be sorry! Whatever. I'm over it! Would the two of you just stop until we get there? Jesus! This isn't the time or the place. Sorry about that! You just don't get it, do you, like... How was I supposed to know you got drug-tested at work? I'm not your fucking husband. Oh, Jesus! Is this about the ring? Fine. You can have mine! Oh, is that how you feel? Fine. Then take mine, too! That's just great! Oh, you two can both suck my ass. If this is how the whole arrangement is gonna go on from now on because a couple of rings, you can count me out, bunch of fucking queens! Fine, then. Fine! So, ah... do you all get drug-tested? You heard that? Uh, I mean, I wasn't trying to, it's just you guys-- you guys like drugs? Sweetie, as I was just telling these two infants, we live in Los Angeles... if you don't have a drug or alcohol problem, you're doing it wrong. Oh, just because I happen to like my job, that means-- Oh, no need to whisper now, honey, the fat lady's belting an encore! Whatever, you fucking drug addict! There! Okay, no. Fuck this. Could you pull over, please? Yeah, just pull over. Get that cardio, honey, try not to buy any crack on your way home! - Please just keep driving. - Cause you're a drug addict! - Sorry. - Crackhead. - Stop being such a bitch! - Thank you. Wait, me or him? You, Beaux, Jesus! We're just trying to look out for you! Well, stop! I'm not your fucking husband, I'm not your child, I'm just some guy that both of you fuck because you two are bored with each other! I can't believe you just said that. Mind if I say something? Wish someone would. I think it's pretty cool. You know, the whole gay marriage thing. Oh, Jesus Christ, next you're gonna tell us you voted for Obama, right? It feels like Thanksgiving all over again. Voting for Obama twice. I did that. No, no. Not that. Like, how you two are married and all, but still do your thing with him, as a couple? Is... Did I get that right? Eavesdrop much? Yeah. Yeah, by the way, I did vote for Obama. Twice. Oh, my God. Okay, one more thing. I mean, as cool as it sounds is, like, the open relationship thing, is it really worth it? With all the fighting? We're not fighting about that. Oh, well, what are you fighting about? Listen, as much as I appreciate any straight white boy being woke, trust me, there's still some shit straight little ears just can't comprehend, nor do we care to hear your opinion. Don't worry. I don't deserve to have an opinion. Why? [whistles] Okay, fine. Buckle up, bitch. This drama queen is pissed because I gummied just a little bit of blow before I ate out his ass. It is not about that! And now he's worried he can't pass his drug test. I'm not mad about the drug test! You are just not being honest. I wouldn't have even known if my ass wasn't completely numb! We're not mad, Beaux. We're just concerned about you using again. That's all! Using? Says the girls who drink G every time we go out! Oh, stop. That is not the same thing. Okay, so okay, so where's the fucking-- Wait, wait, wait, G? I don't know what G is. What's G? - It's Gamma Hydroxybutyrate. - GHB. You know, the date rape drug? - Yeah. - Gays chug that shit for fun. - Wait, what, for real? - Yup. But even though princess over here flushed my entire eight ball down the shitter to save me, I'm the bad guy. I'm the bad guy with no drugs going to a fucking disco like a diabetic going to Willy Wonka's fucking chocolate factory! I know a guy, uh, if you-- Absolutely not! He has a problem. Shut up do you, really? And we're trying to work on it. Okay. So there's the fucking cutoff? You girls, you girls can chug G, snort K, take X, along with the rest of the fucking alphabet, but I do a little bit of blow and it crosses the line! Because you lied! It's ruining your life! I know I'm just a straight white dude and you don't care to hear my opinion, but I gotta say being gay sounds pretty cool. Sweet drugs, tons of sex with other people while you're married, discos? Where do I sign up? Any Equinox is a good start. Got news for you, sweetie. Straight folks can do all that stuff, too. We just do it better. Most of the time. But there is one thing we all can't do. Say... sorry? Well, uh, here we are. I want to thank you guys for chatting with me. - Most people, they just kinda-- - Look. Look, I'm sorry. Okay? Honest. It was the drugs. Is it the drugs now? - No. - Have a good night. This my phone? [knock on window] [window opens] Hey, do you really know a guy who can hook me up with some blow? Um, I uh, um-- [cell phone rings] No. Sorry, man. Ah. Okay. Fuck. Okay. By the way, your car smells like puke. Have a good night. Thanks. [cell phone rings] [cell phone rings] Okay... let's go. [phone rings] [whispers] Fuck. Uh... Carly? Yep. Wait... where-- [blows raspberry] So, uh, do you girls want some-- do you want-- wait, uh... Are you even old enough to-- never mind. [GASPS] Actually, do you think you could just drop us off at the next Starbuck's up there? Yeah. I think there's one up after the light up here. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, right here is fine. - Okay. Mm-hmm. All right. - Thank you, thank you. So, ah, you like drugs? You, uh, want some blow? How about a little nose candy? [whispers] Whaddya think? [cell phone rings] Hello? MAN: Yo, my man, it's me. Where the hell you at? I don't see you anywhere. What you doin'? Uh... I'm exactly where you told me to pick you up. MAN: Where the hell did I tell you to pick me up? 6925 Hollywood Boulevard. MAN: Where the hell's that? Exactly where I am. MAN: Oh, shit! Are you at that movie theater place that kind of looks like a Chinese restaurant? Yeah. MAN: Oh shit, man, I'm at Michelle Pfeiffer's star! - Okay? - Know where that is? No. No, I don't. MAN: Oh shit, dude! I think that's you right there. Are you the dude with the DASH sign parked in front of the Chinese Theater, with your four-ways on. Fuck me, I'll be right there. Hold up, hold up, hold up. [call ends] - Let me get this straight-- - Are you--? Pfeiffer's got a star and Keaton don't? I didn't really know that. Now that is a crock of fucking bullshit, dude! I guess, but-- I heard that dude used to rip dips like a motherfucker. Is that true? Keaton? Eh, he's kinda cool, so I bet-- Yeah dude, I'm heading your way right now. In a DASH as we speak. No bro, I'm off tomorrow. No bro, I'm off tomorrow. I go that mandatory eval bullshit 'cause of what went down today. Stop, man, stop! You sound like my fucking wife, man. Don't tell her I said that. I'll be fine. I'll be fine, all right? All right, sick. Yeah, dope. Should be there soon, man. Later. Fuck, man! I probably sound like a massive dick right about now, don't I? You partying it up tonight? Better fucking believe it, son. Yeah? You trying to keep that party going a little longer? I'm trying, dude. Dead-ass tired. Long, shitty day at the office, my guy. Oh, I got something that might wake you up a bit. Hey, you're not a cop, are ya? How'd you guess? Ah, good one. Hmm? Ah, yeah. Sorry. I didn't-- There it is. There it fucking is, man. - No, it's-- - It's the same fucking look everyone gives me when they find out. You don't need to freak out, dude. I'm off duty, relax. I know. I'm not freaking out. I just-- If anything, you should feel more safe. I've still got my gun on me and shit. Oh, yeah? Oh yeah, cool. Shit. That's very cool. You got any guns? No, no. I mean, yeah, at home I do. Yeah, what you got? I got a pistol, a Glock 27. Okay, okay. Not bad. You should carry that shit around with you, dude. You never fucking know around here anymore. Trust me. So what's up? You talkin' to me? Yeah, dude. You like driving DASH and shit late at night? I mean, it gets kinda lonely, but... What are you talking about, lonely? You've got motherfuckers in the back of your car-seat all night long, man! What you mean 'lonely,' probably see all kinds of weird shit. Not really. I mean, you're a cop, right? You probably see cooler stuff than I do. Yeah. Saw someone get shot today. That's pretty cool. Whoa. It was a six-year-old kid. Sorry to hear that, man. Yeah. Yeah, me too. Serve and protect though, right? Another day after the office. City of fucking angels, man. You got any kids? No, I don't. Check this out. I, ah, got a four-year-old back home. Cute little fucker, isn't he? - He sure is, man. - He gets that from his daddy. Pretty sure it's the UPS guy, man. Nobody gets that many Amazon packages. The kid wanted an apple juice. In the picture? The kid that got shot today. Some fucking tweaker all hopped up on PCP. I didn't even know that was still a thing anymore, man. Fucking thought someone was breaking into his apartment. He was in the middle of a fucking 7-11. You like going to work? - Who does, man? - I used to. Feel like I was putting on a fucking superhero cape every day I put that badge on, man. Now I feel like I'm putting a big old bullseye right here on my chest. I kiss my fucking boy every day before I go to work, man. Every day. But I spend my 12-hour day with my heart beating a million fucking miles an hour, just praying to God I can do it again, dude. Shitty feeling. You know what's even worse than that? Thinkin' you're the hero, but everyone else thinks you're the bad guy. Everyone else thinks you're the villain. I mean, fuck, man. I might as well be Darth fucking Vader when I put that shit on, dude. But you know what? At least I wear my fucking cape, man. The scariest ones don't wear a goddamned thing. They fucking blend in right with us, dude. They hide right in plain sight. Fuck, man. I saw your face when I told you I was a cop. I fucking saw it, man. Yeah, well-- yeah. Your butt-hole clenched about this fucking tight. I can feel it. - No, why would it? - That's what I'm saying. You seem like a good enough fucking guy. Yeah. Got nothing to worry about, right? But just knowing I'm a cop-- just knowing I'm a cop made you want to kick my ass to the curb. You regret picking me up, don't you? - Oh, not at all, man. - Oh, bull fucking shit, dude. I can sense that shit a mile away. But you got random motherfuckers hopping in the back of your car all night long, and you don't think twice. You don't think twice about that. Dude sitting there could be a rapist. Dude sitting here could be a drug dealer. This dude could be a murderer. You don't give a fuck. But me, a dude trying to stop rapists, drug dealers and murders, hops back here, and you just about shit your pants. And to be honest dude, I think you might have. It smells a little wonky back here. I mean, do you think you're driving around nuns all night? My fucking ass, dude. I mean, fuck, you could be a drug dealer, for all I know. Yeah, mean, but just the messed up stuff you see on the news, the cell phone videos and the body cams-- And those fucking assholes shouldn't have got the job in the first place, dude. They shouldn't have got the fucking job. But that's a broad generalization, don't you think, that we're all bad? That one group's all good, one group's all bad? Dude, that's the same fucked up mentality that got us in this mess to begin with. I mean, dude, John Q. Public has no idea what it's like, dude. They have no fucking clue. No fucking clue what it's like to do my job, man. I mean, what if there was a camera right fucking there, watching every move you made, huh? You ever drive too fast? Not use your turn signal? Fucking high beams on? Anything? You ever fuck up? I mean, that's not really the same thing, not like as-- Okay. Okay, I'll give you that. I'll give you that. But imagine this now. Imagine the dude you just picked up is all hopped up on PCP, right? And there's a gun pointing at your fucking head, ready to pull that trigger if you mess up one time. You move too slow-- bang, you're fucking dead. You don't use that turn signal, bang! You're fucking dead. You drive too slow, too fast? Bang, you're fucking dead. Would you be a little tense? Ah, yeah, I mean, yeah. Mm-hmm. Now imagine if DASH and the whole fucking world wanted your head for driving too fast, to get that guy out of the car, right? Drive too slow, that guy shoots a fucking six-year-old kid on your watch, man. That look you just gave me-- that's exactly why I'm afraid to do my job, man. And exactly why the fucking kid died today. But you know what? I'd take that look a thousand times over than seeing the look on that kid's mom's face. I get it, dude. I fucking get it, I get it. Rotten apple spoils a bunch, I suppose. But you know what? There's a whole fucking or-- --a whole fucking orchard out there. And you know what Mr. Chapman told me in first grade? An apple a day keeps the fucking doctor away, man. You take away all them good apples, them doctors washing plenty of blood off their hands. Maybe we should wash it off the orchard's roots first, huh? [gagging and splashes] Oh, my fucking God, Jesus fucking Christ. My wife is going to fucking kill me, bro! Jesus, Christ. You got a napkin or something, dude? No, dude, get the fuck-- aghhh! Please. Can I leave this for you? No, get out of here! [beeping] Thanks a lot. Yo, sorry, bro! Jesus. No, no, no, dude! Oh, fuck man! Get this shit-- oh, you fucking-- fucking shit, dude! This is fucking disgusting. Oh fuck, man! Fuck me! Sorry, babe. Ooh, sorry, babe! Oh, God! Oh, fuck! Ah, fuck. Jesus fucking Christ. Fuck. [cell phone rings] Ah, shit! Ah, fuck. Aye. Uh, Jenny? Uh-huh. You okay? Allergies. You want me to turn the heat up? I'm fine. You know, Michael Keaton doesn't have a star on the Walk of Fame? I prefer awkward silence. Thanks. Do you want some blow? - Just kidding. I didn't-- - Yeah, I'll take a gram. No, I'm sorry. Wait, what? For real? How much? A hundo? Yeah. Yeah. A hundred dollars, please. Yeah. Let me just pull over, and I'll get that for you. Yeah. How much did you want, again? Just a gram. Yeah. One sec. You cool? Yeah, yeah. Almost ready here. You got a charger? Uh-huh. Yo, what's the hold-up? Ya, I... uh... I, uh, just have to text my boy, make sure the price is right. Sorry, hang in there. I'll get this for ya. Okay. I know, I know. So no charger, huh. No, I know. Oh yeah, I'll get that for you in a second. Let me just-- sorry. (nervous laugh) Almost ready. Here we go. All righty, then. What the hell is that? Uh. The stuff's inside, if you know what I mean. Yo, if this is some type of prank or something, I don't-- No. What is this shit. Oh, Jesus! Yo, I wanted a gram, man. Oh, is it... is it not enough? - Enough? - I can give you some more. More? Is this shit even real? Ugh, yeah, yeah. Pure AF. [cell phone dings] Wait. Ah... ? Did you pool? Oh yeah, yeah. I'm trying to save some money. - Do you mind if I-- - No. Do your thing. Appreciate the honesty. All right. Mind if I put on some tunes? Yeah, do your thing.

Cocksucking motherfucker! Aaaahhhhhhh! Fuck, Kalli! Fuck, fuck, fuck! Ah. Fuckin' A! OPERATOR: Please leave your message for 8-- Fuck. Shit! Fucking shit. Oh my... fucking shit! Holy fuck! Oh, God. Oh, this stupid belly. - Hey. - Hi. Hi. How ya feeling? - Ugh. Did you see "Jaws 2"? - Uh. I don't know. The movie, "Jaws 2," have you seen it? Oh. Yeah, I think so. Why? I kind of feel like that dead beached whale whose insides burst out. Closest thing I can think of. I could probably eat that beached whale, come to think of it. Mm-hmm? Which reminds me, did you see my post? Oh, yeah, I did. It's funny. Maybe one of these days it'll funny enough to "like." Yeah. Are you-- you got the whole pack of gum in your mouth, or what? Can I get a piece? Oh yeah, go ahead. Sorry, it's right there. Oh. I'm starving. So how's work? Any weirdos? - No, same-old, same-old. - People are so gross. They could be murders or drug dealers, you know? For real. I listen to "Crime Junkies." That, or they're, like, wiping their boogers and farting all over your seats. No boogers or murderers yet. I'm going to be honest, it smells like a fart in here. You should pay to get this car detailed. I wish. I'm a little strapped at the moment. Got a baby to pay for. Yeah. Well, I appreciate you. Damn, this gum's got a kick! I appreciate you stepping up. Yeah, well half my fault, right? I'm serious. Most guys woulda run for the fucking hills. I would have too, if you didn't convince me otherwise. - Hey, you wouldn't have. - No, I would have. I've had, like, nine other late-term abortions. Tenth would have been free. [nervous laugh] That was a joke. Good-- good one. I know you put a girl in here. What? In here. This fat-ass stomach of mine. I really think it's a girl. Oh yeah, how do you know? [car honk] Partly because of some shit I read on Pinterest. But mostly because I don't think it's possible for a boy to stay in my life for eight months. Da duh pssshh. Ouch. I've been around for eight, right? 'Cause you planted your seed in me. No, I didn't-- I just-- Oh my God, I didn't mean to get you all frazzled. I'm not frazzled. I'm ah, I'm just stressed about, you know, yeah. I just-- I just want everything to go right for a change. Yeah. I feel ya. You know, this whole thing didn't seem right. [voicemail plays] WOMAN #2: Hey, sorry I missed you. I just realized we didn't decide on dinner. Surprise me. I trust you. Just please, don't pick pizza. - I already feel so fat. - I'm really fucking glad you convinced me to change my fucked up mind. WOMAN #2: Sorry if I seem distracted... It's not fair to you. This place just never stops. Okay, call you later. I love you. I couldn't be happier that we decided to let things play out. Hey, okay, huh? Yeah. What did you tell me? It's gonna be hard, but we're doing the right thing, here. I don't know if I'm capable of doing the right thing. Yeah, you are. I'll just leave out the part of the story about the drunken one night stand after the Dave Matthews concert at The Bowl, hmm? 'Crash into Me,' every fucking time. You're a good dude. At least I think you are. [Laughs] Fucking Dave Matthews. He should be paying for all of this shit. It's like his voice forces ovulation, or something. You can't park here, you have to go to those spots. Oh. I forgot to tell you, I can't make it into the appointment. I've got a scheduled ride. Are you, fuck-- seriously? Why? Why? Every single time I have an appointment, you always come up with some excuse-- I know, I'm sorry, it's ah... Something came up. How am I going to get home? Take a DASH. No, me. Me. I'll pick you up. Huh. Whatever. Oh. Forget about that voicemail I left earlier. Probably sounded like a psychopath, it's the hormones, don't worry. Let me help you. Wait, wait-- I'll come. I can... I'll get-- I'm coming. [texting notification] Can I take this? Uh. Yeah, sure. [texting notifications] I gotcha. Sorry, um, good luck. I'll see you later. Fuck! Holy fuck! Come on.

KALLI: You ain't fucking with me? Nuh-uh. KALLI: Fuck. Well... [inaudible] Yeah, I know Mommy said the F-word, but I'm allowed to say it. Don't know what to tell you. I warned you, man. What do you mean, you don't know what to tell me? KALLI: I don't care... if you turn six tomorrow. You ain't saying it! You got yourself in this mess. No, you can't say the "shit" word either. Go to bed! Play with fire, you gonna get burned. No, no, Kalli! Kalli! You can't just fucking-- KALLI: I gotta go, bye. No, you can't just fucking leave me like-- Fuck, you stupid fucking bitch!

Busted, how did you guess? Plowed into a cop car, dude. It's either texting and driving or drinking and driving. Yeah. Uh. Sorry. This car don't belong to you? No sir, no. Ah. It's my wife's. Looks like this shitty night's just got started then, huh? I just found out I'm having a baby girl. Hence the texting. Had the same look in my eye when I found out I was having a daughter, too. Congrats to you and your wife. It's not hers. The car? But you just said that-- No, no. The uh... the baby girl. It smells a bit funky in there. Ha. Like puke or shit? Like gunpowder. Carrying a firearm on you? No, sir. I just-- I gave a ride to an officer earlier. I can-- Hey hey, keep your hands where I can see them, sir! Oopsies. Sorry about that. Please remain in your vehicle. This registration expires in about two weeks. I'll be sure to tell the wife. Good news is, your wife won't kill you tonight, not over the car, at least. There appears to be no damages. Bad news is, it smells like a frat party in there. I'm going to ask you to take a step outside the vehicle so I can have a look around. Okay. All right, nice and slow, please shut off your vehic-- [police radio] Reports of shots fired at an officer on Franklin and North Cherokee... Any officer in the area-- Ten-four dispatch, en route.

I think I might have left my-- - Snuck out a little early. - Hi. - Sorry. - How's your night? I was just running all over. It's okay. Whoa. Smells like something died in here. Do you smell that? - Um... - It's my fucking coat. I had a to pump a patient's stomach today. But you brought Thai food. Ah, shit. You forgot Thai food. No, it's uh, just-- It's fine. I'll just get something. No, I ordered it, we just have to go pick it up. No really, it's fine. I have, like, ten minutes. That's all it'll take. Great. Really, I have to-- I know. I know. I know, I know. You still seem frazzled. I'm not frazzled, it's-- Well, it sure as hell sounded like it on the phone earlier. Oh. Oh yeah, what's this news you have to tell me? Umm. Ah... Aw! Did you see Audra and Paul got engaged? Oh my God! Finally. Oh, yeah. Is that what you wanted to talk to me about? Oh my God. Oh my God, oh my God. Did he break... did he cheat on her, or something? No. No no, that's not it. It's just-- ooh. I-- I-- How about we wait until you have some food in you 'cause I know how you get when you haven't eaten. What? What? That is not fair. When's the last snack you had? I had an RX bar. - When? - I don't know. Like, noon. God, what is this? I mean, like, you're seriously-- You've been saying that you need to talk to me-- Let's just wait until you get some food. It's, like, what is it? What is it? You want to divorce me or something? Like, you're really starting to freak me out here. No, no, no, that's not it at all. It's, um, um, ah a surprise. Yeah. I know how much you like surprises. I do. I love surprises. What is it? What? Oh my-- oh my God, did you fix the kitchen sink? No, I didn't have time to do that today. So, you keep guessing. Ummm, okay. Um, I know we talked about a puppy. I'd be excited, but, like, maybe not the best time. Nope. Guess again. Okay, good. Third time's a charm. You can do it. Well, we did go to that jewelry store the other day-- Oh, so close! You'll found out soon enough! Be right back. Ow! My coat. Oh, my God. Oh. [suspenseful music] I fucking knew it! Piece of shit! Oh! Are you fucking-- ugh! What is this? Ugh! My coat-- destroying my car! [trunk clicks open] Tara, Tara, Tara! Tara! Hey! What you doing? Looking for my other white work coat. - No-- - I know I put it in here somewhere. What did someone steal my white work coat? No, no, let's get you back to the hospital, huh? These people are disgusting! Looking for this, I assume? Oh yeah, thanks. I dropped it earlier. Got anything you want to tell me? Um, not off the top of my head. Oh, you mean-- yeah, you mean, like, why you wanted to talk? No, no, no. I mean, like why the hell there's a pack of cigarettes in the glove box. Oh, those aren't mine, they're a friend's. I mean a passenger's. A client's. Stop. Just stop fucking lying to me. No, I'm not lying to you. Okay, okay. I don't care, I don't care. I just, I just want to find my other white work coat. It smells like puke. I'm gonna smell like puke the rest of the day. I made the car smell like puke! I'm sorry. I am really hungry. Can I please just eat? Please? [text notification] Yeah, dig in. Okay. Do you care if I have a bite of your Pad Thai? Ah, you know, there are carbs in the Pad Thai. Yes, thank you, I know there's carbs in this. I'm having a bite. [phone ding] What? I just got your text saying you're on your way. Yeah, weird. So weird. Mmm, my God. This is so fucking good. I feel better. I knew you would. You want some? Ooh, um, no. I'm not hungry. It's amazing. A little cold, but I'm good. Mmm. Honey. Yeah? You picked the good place. - I did, didn't I? - Ah shit, pot hole. God, fuck. There's not as much chicken in this one. Oh, there's one. Ow, yeah, I'm having stomach cramps today, So that's-- it's weird. Want some? You hungry? No, no. [eating noises] Honey, I don't have any more time to get-- I know, I know... Can we-- can we please just talk? Sure. Can we talk and I eat? This is so weird, but you are extremely smart. Getting me food and then telling me-- I don't even know what the fuck you're going to tell me. You tell me you killed my parents, I don't care, whatever. You know how much I love you, right? I love you too. And you know that I'd do anything for you, right? Is this about Audra and Paul's wedding? 'Cause you don't have to go. I know they kind of suck. No, will you please just listen, listen to me, for once? Um, you remember the Dave Matthews concert you couldn't go to? What? Um, no. When was that? About eight months ago. Did I have to cover a shift, or something? Uh-huh. Um, I mean, yeah, I guess. Kind of. Do you remember why we moved into a two-bedroom apartment? You serious? You're seriously going to bring this up? Right now? Every time I try to bring it up, you change the subject. Because it's not a conversation I particularly enjoy having. Yeah, but it's a conversation that we need to have. Well, there's not an outcome to this conversation where I don't end up looking like a selfish, narcissistic bitch. This is the part where you tell me that I'm not in fact a selfish, narcissistic bitch. Oh, yeah, you're not selfish or narcissistic. Or a bitch. Or a bitch. Thank you! But we have to have this conversation, because we haven't finished-- Okay, okay, do you really not think that I don't think about this stuff, too? No, I know you do, but we haven't talked about it, so-- Okay. Okay. Let's do this. I have aspired my entire life to wear this white coat, you know that. High school, college, MCATS, residency-- all those years. And-- and I know, it's just a stupid white coat to you. But you know how much this coat cost me-- three hundred thousand dollars of student loan debt and clinical FOMO. But now that I'm wearing it, I have to work twice as hard just to keep it on, or it was all for nothing! - Tara... - And yes, I would love to be that girl that lays around all day and drinks White Claws and eats Taco Bell, or go on hikes in the middle of the day, bake cute shit on "British Bake-Off," or just maybe have one hour to work out so I don't watch my body fade to flub. I know, I know. I know, but-- I want to go to Dave Matthews. I love Dave Matthews. Okay? The point is, I can think of a thousand other ways to spend three hundred thousand dollars. Just listen! I put my life on hold to make this happen for us. Okay? And I see that life passing me by every single day. But that's cool. I signed up for that. And I think you did, too. Okay. I mean, okay, okay. I want a family, I do. I know you want a baby, and I want a baby, too. I want a baby, too. So we'll figure it out, right? Figure it out. We'll adjust, and I'll reroute, it's just there's moving pieces-- The dirty things that I would do for some Taco Bell and a cigarette. [whispers] Is she a passenger? So awkward. [whispers] She's so pretty. What's up? Oh, hey, um congratulations. How far along are you? Eight long hormonal months, girl, but-- You look great. I feel like a Ziploc bag full of pudding. We have artificial intelligence and self-driving cars, and literally anything we could possibility want to figure out at the palm of our fucking hands, and yet I am still pushing this sucker out like I'm in a freakin' manger. But, at least we can get you high as a kite though, right? Shit. Are you a doctor? Mm-hmm. Sorry, I didn't mean to make your job seem like it's- Oh, no, no, no, no. You look amazing, better than me. And all I have is a belly full of Thai food, so... Oh my God, that sounds so good. Please, please tell me you picked up some grub like I asked. Oh, my god. You're doing Food DASH now too. That's awesome. Um. There's Tom Yum, if you want it. Do you have anything with carbs? Because I've got nothing to hide. Just my Pad Thai. [laughter] Okay. Um, okay. I... I don't have cooties, so... Girl, I don't care if you have the Bubonic Plague. Hell, yes! Thank you. Can I get that fork? Oh, um, sure. [slurping and eating noises] Goddamn, I just named this baby girl of yours Pad Thai. I've got to get back to work. Um, it was so nice meeting you. Mm-hmm. No, I really, I have to go back. Oh, I know. Oh, I thought you were a passenger getting dropped. Do you guys know each other? Ah, yeah, I'm his-- We're just going to go for a little ride, yeah. Babe, this isn't funny. I have to be back, I am 10 minutes late-- Babe? Yeah? Babe? What's up? What's going on here? I'm a bit confused myself. Do you two know each other? Um-- Ha. Yeah, you could say that. And you are? She's my favorite prostitute. [laughs] I'm this strange man's wife. Don't call me that in public. We talked about that. - Yeah. - You doing okay? I am a bit frazzled now. Yeah. So, you two know each other? Mm-hmm. Hmm. How so? - Um... - Yeah. Ha, okay. That strange man up there put this baby in me. So... So, unless the two of you, uh, met and then got married within the last eight months, I think we've got a pretty big fucking problem here. - I can explain. - To who? - To whom? Tara-- I-- Oh my God, this is real. My God, this is real! Tara. Tara, Tara, I-- Shut the fuck up. Just shut the fuck up? Not a single fucking word! For what it's worth, I had no idea-- Yeah, that goes for you, too. Shut up! Okay, miss. Listen, I'm about to kill the man sitting next to you. Do not put yourself on that list, too! - For what it's worth... - Shut the fuck up! - Shut the fuck up! Take me back to work, please. No, no, no. Tara, Tara, we have to talk about this. Yeah, I'd actually like to walk from here-- No, no, no, please, no. No one's getting out of this car until we talk about this and act like adults here, - because I have to tell... - You want to act like adult? Okay, fine. I work 100 hours a week, I own my own car. Um, what do you besides knock up random sluts? - It's not about that right now. - Excuse me! Who? Were you going to keep this a secret from me? No, no. I was going to tell you. I had a plan-- So, how were you going to pay for-- oh, man. I had a plan. Oh my God, you were going to pay for this bastard child with my money! - No, it's-- - Bastard child? Excuse me-- You can't even afford your own car! You know that, right? No money, no money, and you want to raise a child behind my back! Oh, my God. My God! I would appreciate it if you saw my side in this, because I am carrying this man's child, and I-- I was going to tell you, too. I just-- Oh. Oh, you were? When? In the fucking delivery room? At my fucking hospital? Ow, please! Ow, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop! I know, I know, I know. I'm sorry! I'm driving! I'm fucking driving! Babe, baby, babe, babe. Fuck you! And fuck that baby! Oh, you're really gonna play the fucking-- No! No! Oh, no no, stop! Stop it! Oh! Will you fucking-- somebody just fucking listen to me for a fucking change? I spend all day every day listening to what other people have to tell me-- but it's my turn now! This isn't about us. It's about that baby, right there. You're going to divorce me. You're going to get full custody. I understand if neither of you ever want to talk to me again, I get it. I get it! But please, I know, I know that you two will never give me another chance. I don't deserve one. But let that child just give me one. Fuck! [thump from trunk] What the hell is that? Yeah, everybody, let's get out. Yeah, let's just-- let's get out. What have you done to my car? No no, probably a flat tire. You ruin everything! - Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out! Get out! - What kind of flat tire is... Yes. No, I know, it's okay, a flat tire is-- I'll change it real fast. Ow! Okay, BRB! I'm sorry. BRB! Ow. Holy fuck. Holy fuck. I know, I hear you. I fucking hear you. Jesus! Fuck. ( Help me! Somebody help me! ) - Calm down, calm down! - ( Help me! ) - Okay, okay, okay! ( Someone, help! ) Stop yelling! ( Get me out! ) Fuck! Fuck! Um, ah. Shit! Ow! ( Get me out of here! Somebody help me!) Oh, shit! ( Someone help, please! Please! Please!) Hello? Is there someone in the trunk of the car? - What the fuck do you think? - Jesus Christ-- are you okay? What the fuck do you think? Stop asking stupid questions! I'm not asking stupid question, I just-- Get me the fuck out of here! Okay. Wait, wait, wait-- Are you fucking insane? Help! Stop, stop, stop, please! Stop yelling. Stop yelling! Get me out of it! Please! Please! Just get me out of here! Okay. If I let you out, are you going to scream? No. If I let you out, are you going to run away? >> No. If I let you out, are you going to call the police? Are you going to call the police? I heard what you said. And no, I'm not going to call the fucking police. I just want-- I just want to get out of here. Please! Okay, okay. Please! I'm going to let you out now. Ow! Fuck! Oh. [cell phone rings] Okay. I'm going to open it now. Oh, shit. I got you. I got you. Step down. Yeah. I got you. Here you go. - You got the door? - Uh-huh. Okay. Sorry. Owww, fuck! Oh, shit! Ah! Shit. Okay. Thanks. Yeah. For... for what? Not leaving me-- Not leaving you-- are you serious? That's what usually happens. Basements, warehouses, back alleys. I've came to in just about all of them. Yeah, I couldn't abandon someone like that. This, ah, this ever happened before? Yeah, but always to bright lights, like hospitals, ambulances, flashlights. But never-- this is the first time I came to darkness. Nothing. I thought it was 'it.' I just accepted it. I gave up. Now you've got a second chance. This is my third second chance. I was on my way to rehab. When? You mean-- oh, fuck! You're not a very good drug dealer, are you? How could you tell? I'm your customer. I'm not your friend. Yeah, blame my ED. Huh? Nothing. Scary thing, huh? Not knowing the person sitting in your back seat. Scarier not knowing the person sitting up front. Shit. Can you, um, take me to the hospital? I'm not going to say anything, man. No, no, no, it's not that. It's... I might get a VIP parking spot at that place by the end of tonight. [cell phone rings] I know this is bad timing, but we've got to pick up a few more. I know. Are you sensitive to loud noises? - Like music? - Like screaming. Eh, I don't feel much of anything right now. Two peas in a shitty pod, huh? You got any cigarettes? Um... Ah-- What... ? You've gotta be fucking kidding! Oh! - Is she-- - Oh, God. [inaudible yells and cries] We have to go now! Get in the fucking car now! Are you okay?! Oh, my god! Drive! Drive! - Okay, okay. We're going. - We're going to breathe, - and we're going to count to five. - Oh, my god. I don't want to fucking count to five. I want to go to the fucking hospital! I'm going. I'm going. Oh, fuck you, fuck you. Fuck you! - I'm sorry-- - Fuck Dave Matthews. Oh, my god. Fuck you for all of this. Where the fuck did you go?! I just went around the corner-- You fucking left us there!
