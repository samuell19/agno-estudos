In 1933, Fiorello La Guardia ran for mayor, promising to rid New York City of corruption and organized crime, which was a laudable goal, but not an easy one. He needed a win, so he picked on someone his own size. Pinball, he said, was gambling, ruled by the mob, a racket to steal lunch money. So, he banned it -- you know, for the children. And it wasn't just a ban. It was a public relations crusade. Major raids throughout the city, squads of police swarming into bowling alleys, bars, anywhere they could find them. And in what has to be one of the most heavy-handed metaphors in US history, the city used the legs of the confiscated machines to make new police billy clubs.
