- I'm especially struck by the prince's advice to the players. If you'll indulge me, I'm just gonna do a little excerpt... "For anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing whose end, both at the first and now, was and is to hold as t'were the mirror up to nature. To show virtue for own feature, scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure." Now I find this particularly exciting as it's one of the first notable examples of meta-theatricality. Now certainly we see this more later in European theater of the 19th and 20th century. Artaud, Genet, Brecht, Beckett... But what's really interesting about-- But there's something about the accessibility and timelessness of the imagery here, particularly with the mirror. Profound in its simplicity. Now we're looking at a young man. Essentially orphaned. Plagued by impulse and inaction trying to understand himself. Deciding who he wants to be. He's trapped in this world of hypocrisy and performance in which he, no matter what he does or doesn't do, is an ill-fated participant. Though this be madness, yet there is method in't. - I'm sure those are cold by now. There's a fresh tray in the oven, if you don't mind waiting. I did say any time after noon, didn't I? - Yeah, you did. You did, I uh, I was trying to get out-- - Your teeth. - What? - You have asparagus in your teeth. - Oh. Oh yeah. Yeah. It's a big one. Right, sorry I'm a little late. I had to pick up a shift this morning. - You didn't call. - Don't have your number. And my phone is dead anyway, so. Do you have a charger? - First drawer on your right. - Thanks. They didn't include one with the rental car. Sometimes they... they do. Thanks for setting that whole thing up by the way. - My pleasure. - It's a really beautiful property. - I'm very fortunate. - How long have you been up here? - For four years. Before that it was a lot of traveling. Paris. Ecuador for a long time. - Wow. - Hong Kong. - That must have been amazing. - It paid for the house. - What exactly do you do for-- - Right. I realize we haven't been properly introduced. Richard. - Seth. - It's good to meet you, brother. - Yeah. Yeah, Richard, I gotta say man, I was, I was a little surprised to get your letter. - I thought you might be. - Last week I didn't even know you existed. - Well, that's the thing about wealth, Seth. It can be a cloak if you choose to use it that way. But I figured it was high time we met. Call it a belated graduation party. - I graduated like two years ago. - I said belated. Besides, you only just got a permanent address. When I send a letter, I need to know it's going to be received. - How long have you known about me? - Seth. I've been watching you your whole life. - What? - Not all the time, on and off, from a distance. It's kinda creepy what you can find online. Sorry about your mother, by the way. - You knew about my mom? - Yes, I did. - Well why didn't you do anything? - I didn't think it was my place to intercede. - She was dying. - Yes she was. Look Seth, you just met me and, uh, I hope this doesn't sound callous, but, your mom was dying. Not mine. - Did you build this house? - Me and 74 Mexicans. Yeah. Yeah, it was a big project. - Yeah. How big is it? - Huge. Seriously. 14,124 square feet on 17 acres. - That sounds like a lot of house for one dude. A'int that the truth. You want? - Um, no, I'm okay, thank you. - You don't drink? - I'm just good right now. - Did you bring the NDA? - Oh. Uh yeah. Uh... I actually wasn't totally sure what to make of it. - Really? The language is very standard. - No, I mean, I, just don't really know why you need it. - I value my privacy. - Sure. Yeah, no, I respect that. - And now, legally... You must. Oh, here, before I forget. WiFi. Wouldn't wanna miss one of your blog posts. - You know about that too, huh? - It's like I said, Seth, the internet's a creepy place. Now, you look exhausted. Why don't you go upstairs and pick out your bedroom and I'll let you know when dinner's ready. - Cool. Uh, did you just say pick out my bedroom? - Any one you like. - Cool. Thank you. - Seth. Welcome home. I'm gonna... - You must be Seth. - Shit. Yeah, sorry, I didn't mean to walk in on you, or, or-- - It's fine. I'm Abby. - I'm Seth. I'm sorry if I scared you. I was just wandering around, I thought they were all empty. Richard didn't mention you so I-- - Do you wanna hand me that towel? Thanks. You look like him. - Who? - Your brother. - Oh, duh. - Turn around. - What? - Go on. - I should probably actually-- - Just do it. Uh huh. There. It's the eyes. - Yeah? Not in my giant biceps? - Well you're still wearing your jacket, I haven't seen those yet, so I wouldn't know. This is totally how every 90s porno starts. - I should really get out of here before my brother shows up. - And that would totally be the next line too. - Yeah, and then it hits you with the subscription screen, right? Five dollars for one day of access. - That's why I pay monthly. - That's very frugal. So I think I should probably-- - Go? - Go, yeah. I'm Seth, by the way. - I know. - Right. I already told you. Okay. I'll see you at dinner? - Highly likely. - Um. You know Richard better than I do. Would he think that this is funny, or? - Maybe. Probably best to keep it to ourselves, though. It's more fun that way. - Okay. Bye. - Find everything you need? - Yeah. - So you like what you saw? - Um, yeah, yeah, it's beautiful. - Great. Why don't you follow me? There's something I'd like to show you. ♪ I gave you my heart ♪ - Whoa. This is-- - It's nice, all right? It's nice. This is it. - What? - That's you, and that's me, brother bear. - We met? - Barely. You were still suckling your mom's tit, but, yeah we sort of did. Just once, 23 years ago. Just about to the day, actually. First day of freshman year at Fairfax. - That's Dad? - That's him. - He looks so young. - And he was. You know, that's the last time I ever saw him. - What happened? - He made his impression on the other legacies, wrote me a check for the next four years, and left. - Geez, Richard, I'm sorry. - He saw his paternal duties through to completion that afternoon. - That was it? - That was it. - Why? - He had you. Once my mother died, our little nuclear family was broken, so... on to the next. - I guess there's a lot that I don't know. - Not really. Dad left, married your mom and had you. Lost all his money in a pyramid scheme and put a pistol in his mouth. Your mom got sick and died and now, you're here. With me. Dinner's ready. Seth, this is Abby. - Pleasure to meet you, Seth. - Richard. You didn't tell me that we had a sister. - She better not be my sister, what with all the dirty shit I've done to her. Let's eat. - You'll get used to him. - It's like um, a lifestyle thing. I guess it's a brand, although, that sounds really pretentious. It's embryonic, but it has a heartbeat. - What's it called? - Blink. It's like, um, current events, a lot of politics. Kind of how it all shapes these cognitive biases in our society. - Totally. - Who's your audience? Ironic hipsters? Social justice warriors? Millennials? - Yeah. - I think it sounds really promising. - I think you should change the name. - Why? - Why? Blink? It sounds like you're saying your eyes are closed. - You know it's like, giving you more clarity almost. You know, blinking is rejuvenating. - Blink. Blink. Nope, no. Sorry. I don't like it. You makin' money? - Like I said, it's embryonic-- - Okay, so no. - Well I think it has potential. - So does a box of nails. What's your timeline? - I don't know. - What do you mean you don't know? You don't have a plan? - Yeah, I do have a plan. - So? - I just... - The IP seems pretty weak if you ask me. I mean, right off the top of my head I can think of a dozen other pop psych websites that are trying to do the exact same thing you're trying to do. What do you have that's proprietary? - Proprietary? - Proprietary means original. - Exclusive-- - Yeah, Richard. I know what it means. I-- - So? What's the answer? What makes your business unique? - I wouldn't even call this a business. - Baby-- - See. There's your problem right there. How's it ever gonna be a real business unless you start treating it like one? You're the founder. - That's not what I meant, I mean-- - Baby. Come on. - What about financial projections? - It's a start up. - So was Apple. Buzzfeed. Netflix. You think any of them took their first shit without a basic financial plan? Honey, do you wanna put that Pinot in a sippy cup 'cause we're having dinner with a five-year-old? - Richard, did you just bring me up so you could bust my balls? - Ooh, tough guy. - Richard. Just let him eat his dinner. - I'm trying to help him. - Yeah. Well. You're not. So... - You know what? Baby, you're right. Seth, I apologize. I just... I have strong opinions. - It's fine. - Gesundheit. - What? - You sneezed. - No I didn't. - Yeah, you did. You sneezed. - No I didn't. - You sounded like a fuckin' rhinoceros. I know it wasn't Abby. She doesn't sound like that, even when she's, uh... - Okay. - All right, I'm messin' with you. Come on. Come on, just-- - What? - Relax, all right? Just, just relax. Try blinking, it'll rejuvenate you. Finish that soup. Those Alba truffles just got flown first class from Italy. They cost more than you made last year. Before taxes. - They're actually my favorite, you should-- - You know what, I'm fine. I'm not hungry right now. - Come on. A strapping young innovator like you? - I'm not young, Richard. I'm almost 25. - What, did you blow snot in there when you sneezed? - I didn't fuckin', I didn't sneeze. - Walked right into it again. Huh? Well this was great. This was, uh, very... rejuvenating. Dessert's out back. Blink. - You really do look like him. - Whatever, as long as I don't have his sense of humor. - He does that sometimes. - He acts like there's voices in his head sometimes? That's hilarious. - You'll get used to the-- - I'll get used to him? - Yeah. He just wants you to be comfortable here. We both do. - Well so far he's getting a D-minus, and that's only because these Alba truffles, oh they're so expensive they cost more than I made last year before taxes. - He can be a little rough around the edges. - Yeah, no shit. Sorry. - He loves you. - He loves me? He doesn't know me. - Doesn't have to. You're his brother. And look, if you're ever having a hard time getting a read on him, you can always come to me. Any time. For anything. - Thanks. Except maybe not when you're in the shower, right? - Hey, if the door's open. - Seth. Give you 100 bucks if you swallow this right now. - Oh no thanks. Add a couple zeros, I'll think about it. - Too late. I like your style, though. - Sure I can't you one? - Oh no, I'm okay, thank you. - You sure? Richard's a lot more fun when you're not sober. - I bet. I don't really drink for fun. - All right. Well, let me know if you change your mind. So, tell me about your website. - Uh, I don't really wanna talk about that anymore. - Oh come on, it's just me. - It's going really slow, like I was saying, but, you know, it's just me, I'm trying to get up all this content-- - You should get a model. Put her in a t-shirt, right there on the homepage. - Well the brand is kind of academic. - It doesn't matter, it's universal clickbait. - Well I also don't have any equipment or studio space and that stuff-- - Richard has those. - Of course he does. - He gets a new camera every year for his birthday, so if you don't mind shooting yourself, I mean... - What about a model? - Seth. Let's play Chubby Bunny. - What? - No, no, no, no, no. Let's do it. I always beat Abby, it's completely unfair 'cause she has such a tiny mouth. You might actually present some competition. - Are you serious? - Uh, 100 bucks if you beat me. - Richard, I don't really like to bet-- - Thousand bucks. No shit. - Oh, okay. Yeah, okay, for... Yeah, I'll play. - Excellent. All right, the rules call for two marshmallows at a time. Yes, you can position with your fingers> No, you can't chew or shallow. If you do, you lose. If a marshmallows pops out of your mouth, you also lose. If the words Chubby Bunny are not both audible and clear-- - I lose. - You lose. Abby's officiating. Any questions? - Uh yeah. I have-- - Let's play Chubby Bunny. Oh my god, are you? Okay. Uh, yeah. Alright, let's go. - You scared? - No. Let's play. Chubby Bunny. - Okay. Okay. You didn't embarrass yourself. That's not what I was expecting. Chubby Bunny. - Chubby Bunny. - Both still in. - Chubby Bunny. - Chubby Bunny. - Your move, babe. - Alright, fuck it. Chubby Bunny, bitch. What the fuck? - Chubby Bunny! - Looks like Seth wins. - Fuck! Well played brother. You psyched me out. Very impressive. Who would've thought you would be so adroit at Corpulent Hare. I'm very impressed. You psyched me out. I didn't think it was possible, least of all from you. But you did it. You won. I'm going to bed. I'm a loser-- - Not a lo-- - I'm going to bed, no, I know I am, I know I am. See you later? And... Seth, until tomorrow... when the adventures continue. - Can't wait. - Congratulations, champ. - Gross. Fuck you, Richard... - Oh yeah, baby. Oh my, give it to me! Give it to me! - Fuck. Mmm. - If you're not happy with the continental, I can make you something hot. - This is perfect, thanks. - Okay. Just let me know. You know it's not healthy to eat while standing, right? You sleep okay? - Um, yeah, kind of. - Hey, I totally get it. The first night I stayed here, I barely slept a wink. Before I forget. - What's this? Is he serious? - Of course he is. - This was a joke. - Richard never jokes about money. - Well, I mean this is super generous, but I can't accept that-- - You have to. Deal's a deal. Signed, sealed, and delivered. - A thousand dollars is a lot of money. - Seth. I think he can afford it. - I should at least find him. Say thank you. - I would advise against that. Better to just accept the gift. He prefers it that way. - What are you working on? - Shopping, emails, a little bit of coding. - Coding? - Working on a few security bugs on my company's new interface. - Oh you have a company? What do you guys-- Oh. - Give me a sec. One sec. - So what do you do? - It's kind of hard to explain. Tech start up is my go-to cocktail party explanation. - Start up, that's cool. What is it? - We cater to an eclectic mix of wealthy clientele. It's very project specific, but... That's really the best way I can put it. Are you gonna finish all that fruit? - Oh. No, probably not. I uh... Have you seen Richard around? - He's running some errands, but he should be back by lunch. I'm done for now, so, we can do whatever you want in the meantime. - How about a tour? - You should see it in the autumn. - Yeah? Well maybe I'll come back for Thanksgiving. - We'd like that. Richard's already working on the menu, so. - Oh, yeah, wild turkey straight from off the property? - Sorry to, uh, disappoint, but there are no animals on the premises. - No? No pets? - No. I mean, Richard's always talking about horses, but, no. Not at the moment. - Can I ask how you guys met? - Me and Richard? - Yeah. - The internet. - Yep, that makes sense. - What's that supposed to mean? - It doesn't, no, no, it doesn't mean anything. I'm just saying, Richard doesn't seem like the type who's trolling a college bar. Although he does seem like the type who would have a roofie in his pocket, so that works. - Oh, and you would know all about what that's-- seems like a very reputable place to form a lasting connection. - Oh, very funny. Just, for the record, I didn't know about his lifestyle when we first started dating. - He didn't tell you about this in the first couple of seconds? - I mean, I knew he had money, but um, not like this. - Don't know why he'd hide it. There's so many of them. - The staff? It's only about half, really. They're usually not here on the weekends, but, we're trying to finish the cabin. Hey baby. - Give me a second. - I didn't know you were gonna be home, I would've uh-- - I said, give me a second. Eh, you fucker. Sit tight, all right? - Mhm. - This wood aint gonna beat me. You stay there 'cause I am going to chop you. Right now. Fuck. Yeah, I got back uh, 48 minutes ago. Realized we used the last of our stores last night. - You know you could've had one of the groundsmen take care of that for you. - I handle my own wood. Seth, it's good to see you again, brother. - Good morning, Richard. - Did you have breakfast? - Yeah. - Good for you. It's the most important meal of the day. Your kindergarten teacher wasn't yankin' your dick. No. No, I know, I never thought of Miss Grant as a dick yanking type. - Nor should you, that's gross, and it's illegal. Abby, would you grab us a couple of swimsuits and meet us at the pool in 10 minutes? 11 minutes? - Sure. You got it. See you guys in a few. - Help me out with my wood here. Seth, I wanna apologize if I came off a bit strong last night. I realize you may not know me so well, but, I know you, and I care about you, and you're my brother. - Thanks Richard, I appreciate it-- - I only want you to succeed. I've done a lot of bushwhacking in my time so if there's something I can offer to make the journey a little bit easier for you, then that's what I wanna do. - Richard? - Yes, sir? - Abby said you don't have pets. - We don't. - There's a dog. - Where? - Or there was. - Must be a stray. There's a busted piece of fence back there. I'll tell Armando. Come on. - Listen Richard, um, I need to thank you for the money-- - Hey. - That was-- - Don't ever do that. Don't you ever let me hear those fucking words come out of your mouth again. - What? - Don't ever thank someone for giving you what you earned. - But-- - But my ass. This was the arrangement. You get what you earn. And that's all there is to it. Baptism by water, baby! Woo! Brother bear, hop in. - Um. I'm gonna wait for a minute. - The water's 81 degrees, don't be a pussy. Besides, I can't play Sharks and Minnows by myself. Now we got two. - What's Sharks and Minnows? - All right, are you ready? - Ready. - Are you ready? - I guess. - Sharks and Minnows. I'm gonna drag him into the shallows! I'm gonna drag him in and drown him! Swimmin' at the surface? Rookie mistake, minnow! - Dude you almost drowned me! - No, I didn't. Great job babe. - Thanks, babe. - Seth, get your ass over here now. Go, doggy paddle, let's go. - I'm coming. - All right, here's what we're gonna do. You're gonna go up strong, up the center, raise up, try to catch her. I'll cover each flank for when you inevitably fail. Got it? - Yeah. - Ready? - Yeah. - You ready? - Ready. - All right. Sharks and Minnows round two! Oh, fuck! - What is it? - Babe, just take it out. - Ugh, I'm trying to. This thing is not waterproof, actually! - Can I do anything? - Just stay there. - What is it? - Hearing aid. Must've gotten waterlogged. - Are you serious? - Yeah. He hates false advertising. He'll probably have the whole company shut down now. - No, I'm talking about the hearing aid. - Yeah, ever since the accident. - What accident? - The one that killed Daisy. - Who's Daisy? - His wife. Jesus, Seth. You don't know anything, do you? - Well, I mean, what was it? What happened? - It's really his story to tell. - Was it his fault? - No, of course not. - Was he drunk? - No. I, I don't think so. - Then what was it? - You saw. Winding roads, no streetlights. You drove 'em yourself. He spiraled into a telephone pole, you know, and-- - Yeah, and he lost the hearing in his left ear, and she lost her life. And we spiraled into a wall, not a telephone pole, Abby. If you're gonna tell it, tell it right. Seth. Hot tub. Now. - Ah. It's hot. - Very perceptive, bro. I like it. - Look, just give me a sec. So, uh, are you all right, Richard? - Did I patronize you about your dead mom? Don't patronize me about my dead wife. Stop being a pansy and get in the water. Atta boy. I remember the first time I fucked Abby in here. - Jesus, Richard. - Yeah, that's what she said. - Why are you telling me this shit? - What, you honestly trying to tell me you wouldn't wanna bang Abby in this hot tub? - No! Dude, that's your girlfr- No! I don't. No. - Uh huh, just like I thought. She's fuckin' hot, right? - Yeah, Richard, she's fucking hot. - God damn right she is. Abby. Come here, baby. - What's up, boys? - Do me a favor and put this in recycling for me, and would you bring me a new one? - What did you have in mind? - I'm thinking about a Moscow mule, and that Moscow mule has a friend who is also a Moscow mule. - Oh no, thanks, not for, I don't want one. - So two Moscow mules. Aspetuck? Two Roads? Black Hog? Nothin'? - You sure, nothing? - She's puttin' out. You gonna turn her down and be a pan-say? - Anything you want. - Do you have ginger ale? - Two Moscow mules and a ginger ale, coming right up. - Thank you, baby. I know you're busy. - Thank you. - You got a girl? - No. No, not, not right now. - Why? - Just don't. - That aint no kind of answer. - I have other priorities right now. - Like what? Blink? Alright, what would you say is the reason why honeys avoid you like the Bubonic Plague? Is it your lack of financial stability? The general cloud of melancholy that follows you around everywhere you go? Your breath? - Excuse me? - All right, we're gettin' there. Lackluster sexual prowess? Am I getting warmer?! - Go fuck yourself, man! - Oh Abby fucks me, I don't fuck myself. - What the hell is your problem? - I'm trying to help you. What's my problem? Are you gay? Ah! I got you, you motherfucker. Balls busted. I'm a homophobe. - All right, you-- - Oh come on. - Stop! - Bustin' my balls, huh? Come on, come on. I'm a homophobe, all right? I'm a bigot now? Come on, but pussy all the way, am I right? - Thank you, thank you, I think I'm just gonna head home now. - What are you talkin' about? Seth. You just got here. - Yeah I know, like I said. Beautiful property. - Seth! - Seth, what were you thinking for dinner? - Whatever you want. I'm not gonna be here. - What? Seth. What happened? - Nothing, I just, I gotta go back to the city. - But I thought we were gonna hang out. - Abby. We did. Look, if you're ever in my neck of the woods, you should look me up. I'm sure that Richard has everything you need to find me. - Seth, I'm really loving talking to you-- - So do I, but I'm not gonna stay here and be the butt of Richard's joke anymore. - I'll talk to him. I'll talk to him, and it'll be fine. - You shouldn't be here either. You know this place isn't good for you. - Seth, please stay. - Abby, this has nothing to do with you. You are unbelievable and fascinating-- - I love it when you say shit like that. - I have to leave. - What, are you fucking kidding me? Seth. - Richard. - Just stay one more day. - What's that? - 10,000. - Are you bribing me? - Fuckin'-A right I'm bribing you. - Why do you even care if I'm here?! - Look, Seth. You're my only brother and I know, I guess I screwed up royally, but, you gotta give me a chance to make it right. Take the money. - I can't. - Sure you can. You have a hand and you have a checking account. I've seen it. Don't act like you don't need this. Take the money, Seth. - One day. - Yeah, that's the deal. Bro. No? Too soon. That's cool. We'll get there.

That was fun. - That was fun. - It was so fun. - So fun. - Oh, oh. Seth? - Yeah, Richard. Super fun. - Okay. Well, it's late. We could probably all use a little sleep. Some of us more than others. Why don't we start fresh in the morning? - I'll see you later. - Good night. - Good night, Richard. - Want one? - No, thanks. - So, what were you working on today during lunch? - Oh um, I mean it was kind of a business plan, but-- - That's awesome. - Nah, it's stupid. - You should show Richard. - No. - I'm serious. - No. - He's really good at that kind of stuff. - Okay, I'll think about it. - Good. - Look, I'm really exhausted. I didn't get much sleep last night, so-- - You know, you could've just come in. - What? - Last night. Come in, to our room. - I really wish you had. - I'm sorry? - If you're ever having trouble sleeping. Richard and I are like total night owls, so, if that ever happens again, totally feel free to knock on the door. We'll get up, watch a movie with you. You could've checked this place out a whole lot sooner. - Right. - Oh. While I was doing laundry, I found this. I didn't know you had any of these made up. - Yeah. One, and it's mine. - Well I was thinking about what we talked about the other night and I thought that maybe I could help. Model, I mean. I think it'd be really good for you. - Abby, that's really generous, but I-- - But nothing. You can even have me for the family discount. Free. We can do it right now if you want. - It's the only one that I have. And it's too big for you. - No, I'll just tie it up and crop it, watch. There. How do I look? - Did Richard put you up to all this? - What? - Did Richard ask you to do this? Offering to model and taking off your clothes in front of me and kissing me. - I'm just trying to help, Seth. And I kissed you because... - Yeah. Look Abby, it's a really nice offer, but I think I'm gonna pass. At least for tonight. - Okay. I guess I'll, um, see you in the morning then. - Yep. - Just for the record, I'm really glad you stayed. - Hey. What the fuck?! - Seth? I thought you might be awake. - Abby? Are you, did the piano wake you up? - What piano? - There was, there was pi-- Richard was just playing the piano. He was butt naked in the darkness. It was really weird. - He must've been sleep walking. It, uh, happens. - I didn't know you could play a sonata in your sleep. - Neither did I. Can I come in? - Are you all right? - Yeah, um, I told you you could knock on my door any time, so I thought the offer went both ways. - Is Richard, um? - Oh. His REM cycle just kicked in. Said so on his FitBit, so... - Oh. - We've got at least, like, 80 minutes. I won't be long. I just wanted to check in with you. - Yeah I'm, I'm okay. - You really scared me today. - What do you mean? - I thought you were gonna leave. - Yeah Abby, I was. - Well would you mind if I just laid next to you for a little bit? This mattress is way more comfortable than ours, and I was just gonna-- - I-- - Please? Just for like a minute, I-- - Yeah, yeah. - Okay. Thanks. Where did you go to school? - What? - College. Where did you go to college? - Oh um, NYU. Why? - I went to Columbia. - Congratulations. - I was just thinking about what it would've been like if we knew each other before this. - You would've ignored me. - That's not true. - Easy to say. - It's easy to mean. - Abby. Richard's right. I... I've got nothing going for me. - That's not true. - Yeah, it is. - You're just looking in all the wrong places. I mean, you're passionate, introspective, a great sense of self. All those things make someone really fuckable. - Wait, no, no, no, no, no. I can't. - Seth, come on, please. - No, Abby, I don't know what's going on here. - Neither do I, but-- - No, stop, stop, please. - What, am I not your type or some shit? - Of course you're my type, you're everybody's type. It doesn't matter, you're fucking my brother. - Yeah. But right now, I am trying to fuck you, so-- - Abby, no. Look, you don't have to be here. You know that, right? You don't have to be in this house. You have a fucking multi-national company or whatever. You probably make more in a day than I make in 10 years. One day you're gonna have a place that makes this castle look like a fucking trailer. - Seth, just stop. - Abby, why are you here? - It's complicated. - It doesn't have to be. - I'm going. - Abby. Abby, I'm... - Look, I, I am sorry for whatever this was. Okay um, can we please just pretend like it didn't happen tomorrow? - Yeah. What, do you think I'm gonna tell Richard? - No. Of course not. - Listen, Abby. Uh, I'll see you in the morning. - Okay. Sorry to blue ball you. - Good morning, sleepy. Just in time for dinner. - What? - Uh, it's five pm. - Oh. Shit, I slept all day. - Here. You need this more than I do. It's tomato juice. You don't trust me? Listen Seth, I don't wanna cross any lines here. I realize that I'm sort of on probation with you right now, but, I'd be remiss if I didn't tell you that you really disappointed Abby last night. I mean, she was really puttin' herself out there for ya. - She told you about that? - Well yeah, she came to bed all deflated, I asked her what was wrong and she told me. - Jesus, Richard, I'm sorry, man. She came-- - Don't beat yourself up about it, but, do give it some thought between now and dinner. She thinks it would really help you and plus, it'd be fun for her. - What? - If you want, I could even be there in the room, show you how everything works. - Are you fucking serious? - Seth. Relax. I'm not trying to freak you out here, I'm just saying, if you want somebody to be in the room to show you how to work the cameras, I'm happy to do it. If you don't, that's fine. Do the fuckin' photo shoot yourself, I don't care. - The photo shoot. - Yeah, for Blink. She said you were working on a business plan, too, which is great. I'm happy to go through that and redline it for ya, if you want. - That's, that's really nice, Richard, I gotta think about it. - Sure. Sit with it. - I think I'm gonna go for a walk now. - The house and grounds are yours. - Have you seen Abby? - Yeah, she's somewhere. - Abby! Abby, hey. Christ, I thought Richard fuckin' ate you. - Jesus Seth, you scared me. - I thought that... Nevermind. What are, what are you doin'? - Just getting some air. - I didn't know you smoked. - It's been a few months. - Are you sure you're okay? - I'm fine. Seth, you said-- - I know. I just-- - Okay, so, let's go figure out what we're having for dinner. - Actually, I came to find you to say good bye. - What? - I gotta head back to the city before it gets dark. - You're leaving? - Yeah. It's been 24 hours, Abby, that was the deal. - I know, but uh, well you're gonna do what you're gonna do, I guess. - Abby, look, I'm sorry. I told you, this isn't about you. - I know, but... Look. He said he paid you to stay, and... he did, right? But what he was really do was paying you for a second chance. And I don't think you gave him one. - You expect me to just pretend that he's not-- - No. Of course not. But, look, it's been fine. Right? The last 24 hours have been fine. So, what have you got to lose? What are you running back to? A seventh floor walk up with a rodent problem and no air conditioning? - It's the eighth floor. - Well it can't be any worse here. We know all the same people. - Yeah. It's a small world. - Just in time. - Smells great, baby. - Yeah, it'll be good. Seth, I was wondering if I could show you something. - Uh, what is it? - It's a surprise. Abby, throw these in the fridge for me, baby. - Sure. - Let's walk. - Christ. You been collecting for a long time? - Since I was your age. Always came back from a trip with a couple cases. Quickly turned into an obsession. Hobby. Every bottle is a story, Seth. A time capsule. Like tonight's selection. - The first night you banged Abby in a hot air balloon? - First drink at my wedding. Only drink at my wedding. - Richard I'm, I'm really sorry. - Don't be. 10 years. 10 years since we opened the case. 10 years since we said, "I do," and I haven't had a sip since. Seth, tonight I wanna share this with you. - Richard, I would man, I just-- - I know, I know you have your thing, Seth. And I respect that. I don't know. Selfishly, tonight, feels like an occasion for a family, and you're the only family I have left. And I know I can't rewrite the past. But I was thinking that maybe we could start carving out something new, something for us. ♪ Camp town races sing this song ♪ ♪ Doo dah doo dah ♪ ♪ Camp town races fives miles long ♪ ♪ Oh da-doo dah day ♪ ♪ Oh da-doo dah day ♪ ♪ Oh da-doo dah day ♪ ♪ Bet all my money on the bobtail nag ♪ ♪ Somebody bet on the bay ♪ ♪ Oh doo-dah day, hey ♪ - Oh let me help you out there thirsty. - Oh no Richard, I'm good, no. - Oh there aint can't in decanter. - A little bit, a little bit. - You can do it. - That's enough, that's enough, that's it. - I say when it's enough. - You guys, I just wanna interrupt for a second and say that I am having actually a really good time with you. - Oh! Don't worry. Don't worry. Don't worry. - Where are you going? I think we'll probably die. I don't think we'll survive this house. - I don't know how I'll ever survive. - We're not gonna die, we're not gonna die, because if we died, we wouldn't be able to play flashlight tag. - Dun, dun, dun. - I'm not playing flashlight tag. - Yes you are playing flashlight tag, brother bear, and what's more is, you're it. - Oh Jesus. - Jesus can't help you Seth. Piano's base, 20 Mississippis. - Okay. - And um, you have to flash on the face in order for it to count. - And if I win, I get $100,000. - Yes. - Hey Richard, I'm joking. - He's not. - One Mississippi.

Four Mississippi. - Abby, come on, come on, come on. Come on. - Six Mississippi. - Abby. - Ready or not, here I come. - What the fuck? Fuck. Abby. Abby. Abby. Abby! - You're it. - Richard. What the fuck man? Where's Abby? - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, calm down. - Get that fuckin' flashlight out of my face. - Bro, relax. Why don't you breathe some steam? - Don't tell me to relax. Why do you have a camera in my bedroom? - Security. - Where the fuck is Abby? What did you do to her man? Stay back! Stay over there! - Hey, hey, hey, hey. What did I just say? You need to relax. - I said stay the fuck back! - Oh. What are you gonna do with that? - Seth? - Abby. - Oh. - I thought, I thought that... - Give me this. Okay, it's okay. What's going on? - Brother bear here got it in his head that I uh, I don't even know what, attacked you, and he started freakin' out. - Oh god, Seth. Your poor baby. - Abby, what the fuck is this? - Shh. I'm here for you. - We both are. - What the fuck? - I think we all just need to relax, just a little. Don't you wanna play with us? We could all get in the shower. It'll be really fun. - Abby, what the fuck is this? - Shh. It's okay, baby. - Seth. Listen to me. I am 100% okay with this. Isn't that what you've been worried about this whole time? - Hey, get off me, get off me! - I wanna share this with you. - Just share with me, baby. - Oh yeah. We like it rough. - Come on Seth. Why don't you show me what you were thinking about when you walked in on me. - My brother. - Fuck! What the shit? - Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Oh my god. Oh my fucking god. No, no, no. Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god. Fuck! Oh fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. He's fucking dead, he's fucking dead. Oh my god. - What did you do? - Fuck! - I'm sure that's cold by now. But I'm happy to brew you some more if you'd like. - Who are you? - Regular, decaf, there's cream and sugar. - I don't want any fucking coffee, who are you? - No more for me either, I get the jitters if I have too much. We should talk. - Who the fuck are you man? Seriously, let me out of here, I just wanna go home. - And you will, after sunrise. Why don't you come back in here and, and, and-- - Fuck you man. - There's security cameras everywhere, Seth. I wouldn't put on a show if I were you. Also, that cue is made of gold inlayed African black wood, it'd be a shame to smash it over my head. Why don't you just put it down and take a seat, and we can talk. You're not going anywhere tonight. Right. There. There you go. You sure I can't interest you in some coffee? Imported from Jamaica, better than that crap you drink at the hipster bistro in the city. - Who the hell are you? - What would you say your favorite part of the weekend was? Or was there any moment in particular that was memorable-- - Why the fuck am I here? - I told you. I figured it was time we met. Well he told you, but. - It's the wine. He drugged the fuckin' wine, he drugged the fuckin' wine. I'm dreaming, wake up. Wake up! Wake up! - Stop that, stop that. Stop it now. The wine was just wine. You drank it, you had fun. Someone died, but that happens. Oh, good girl. She really likes you. Stay. - I told you he wasn't gonna go for it. - Well I was wrong about that. Still, very exciting, no? - You know this is gonna cost extra, right? - Just fill in the number. - Abby? - You two are so fascinating. - Abby, please, I, I-- - This is between you and your brother, Seth. - My brother? My brother's dead. - You were supposed to be eased into this tomorrow over breakfast but I'm happy to answer any questions you may have. - Oh, let's not patronize him. I'm pretty sure he's figure it out by now. - Are you fucking insane? What's going on? Why did my brother invite me here? - I stand corrected. - Seth. Meet Richard. - No. What the fuck are you talking about? - Some artistic liberties were taken for the sake of the dramatization but for all intents and purposes, you've been interacting with your brother all weekend. - The third act was so exciting, but this unexpected epilogue, Abby, it was-- - What do you people want from me? - Nothing more than what you've already given. This weekend has been incredible. - So what? You're telling me this has all just been some fucked up prank? - No, no, no, no, no, this has been very, very real. - Well, then who's that guy? - Oh him? He's no one. - No one? You were sleeping with him. - It's just sex, Seth, it's part of the job. - So what's your end game here, Abby? Trying to screw me so that this fucker can jerk off? - Please, Seth. Hardly. I had to catch up on 24 years. What better way to get to know someone than by throwing them off balance? - That's crazy. - Let's call it unorthodox. - Let's call it fucked. - You know you can pay people to kidnap you. Literally, kidnap you. Just to see what it feels like. People pay to cuddle, pay to get tickled, pay to get beat up or shit on. I happen to hire someone to orchestrate my own out of body experience. To each his own, am I right? If you've got the money. - No man, I gotta, I gotta go. I gotta go home, I gotta get out of here. - Well the gates won't open until after sunrise, that's for your own safety. - Fuck your gate, man, I'll drive right through it. - Steel bars, Seth. And I don't pay for collision insurance on rentals. - Then I'll hop it. - Seven miles? No street lights? Winding roads? I'd hate to have a drunk driver take a turn too fast and pin you against a telephone pole. Stay. Continue to explore the property while you wait and, it's a lovely night. Or stay here with me. I've got checkers. - Everyone is gonna know about this. - Abby. - You can't enforce that. - I assure you I can. - After all of this bullshit? - I take my privacy very seriously, as do my attorneys. That's air tight. - That guy is dead because of you. - And you're complicit. And there's tapes. At best, it's involuntary manslaughter. - I will fucking kill you. - Then add to that second degree murder, that's 30 years minimum. - Just wait out the night, Seth. - Shut up. - I'd love to keep talking. But that's of course up to you. I love it. - Open the door. - You sure you don't want some coffee? - Open the fucking door! - Seth. Thank you. You're welcome home, any time. - What do you want? - Listen-- - No. - Seth. - Abby, you are a fucking bitch, you know that? What, did he send you up here to make sure I don't jump off? Maybe that's exactly what he wants, who the fuck knows anymore. - He's asleep. It's just me. - "It's just me." Stop with the fuckin' damsel in distress act, it's not gonna work. - No offense Seth, but you're not my type. - What would've happened if I just went for it tonight in the bathroom? - I don't know. That's kind of the whole point. It's like a choose your own adventure book. - What is it? What do you fuckin' want from me? - I was actually wondering if you had any notes. - Notes? - It's our first time doing a Watcher Experience at this scale. We'd welcome your feedback. - Yeah, cut the shit and get a new job. Somebody died because of you. - He knew what he signed up for. Did the naked piano playing provide pathos or was it just goofy? Did we incentivize you enough? More sex, money, social interaction? We're still working on the variables in the reward system, but I'm-- - Abby, please shut up! - Here. - No. No. No! - I'm not going through this song and dance with you again, Seth. Just take the money. You won the game. - This was all a fucking joke. - Not to Richard. One more thing. If you invest that money right, we have a lot of options that can make themselves available to you. - Yeah, no thanks. - Think about it. - Why did you get involved in this shit? - There's only so much you can do with a BA in theater. - And I just have to think, the world that they're living in and I guess the world that we're living in, is that even a question we can answer, I mean, who are we? Really?
