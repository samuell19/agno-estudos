Faster! Give me a bag. Big Brother. The real thing, so it's lived up its name. Heroine can be had in any quantity. They say you've a way in NY. Let's combine to snatch your heroine businesses from them. Okay, it's mutually beneficial. Now I want 20 kilos of that stuff. Where's the money? Here. Mind you. Don't talk nonsense in front of Mr. Big Brother. Trying to draw? Are you looking for hell? Great! If you work with me, the other families will go bust. He's my brother. Get 20 kgs of stuff for him. You bustard Ping! Don't move, CID! Don't move! Don't move! Police, drop your gun! Damn it! Drop your gun! Big brother, run! Stay where you are! Drop your gun and climb up slowly. No monkey business! My gun has no eyes. Put your hands on your ears! I never flop in any mission! Damn you! Are you alright, Uncle Te? Yes. Well, an experienced fireman gets his fingers hurt? Nonsense! Trying to run? Get out of my way! Stop, police. Freeze! Keep away! Drop your gun! Drop or I'll kill her! Come on, put it down! Hear me? Drop it or I'll shoot her dead. Drop it! Outrageous! You scum. Are you sick of living? Keep down, police! Are you fed up with living? After him! Shirley, don't come up! It's dangerous! Get the frogmen to salvage. Yes, sir! Did you mean to get killed? Sorry! Mr. Huang Cordon off the spot and call an ambulance. Yes, sir! Mr. Huang... Thank you all for the trouble. I nearly forgot to get back a bait for Shirley. Uncle Te, see how much our haul is, Yes, sir. Hsiu, here you are, fixed. Good. Mr. Wei. Here's a file from the USA. This new drug syndicate is now in HK. Watch their movements. Let's have more. I've had enough. Cheers! Don't... What? Really can't drink. You're lying. Enough... Well, I'll drink more tomorrow. Let's talk about it tomorrow. Listen, anyone making trouble tomorrow will be transferred to Shataukok. Are you trying to avenge a personal grudge. What do you mean? Mr. Huang judge for us. We celebrated for him because we took him for a friend. He's not taking us for friends. What do you think? Help me, or I'll get drunk for sure. Okay. You're getting married tomorrow. Drink this, or Shirley has to clean the house for me. Right, Shirley will stay to clear up the rubbish. Don't think it's easy to be a housewife. Do you want him to drink. I don't. Well? Drink it. Don't drink. Drink this big glass. Don't side with him so soon. We bachelors... really envy your true feeling. You're lucky, you're quitting tomorrow. But we really are depressed. Why fight? Only yesterday the doctor said my heart's weak. What? I can't stand the shock. Sometimes you can't take a doctor advice too serious. Sister, he can't stand the shock. Can you? You don't drink this, you must clean the house. Go and collect the ashes. Drinking's bad for health. What about venting our feeling? That suits me better. I'm a virgin. I've lots of grievances, lets vent them. Ah Yu, come here! What's it, Hsiu? What's wrong with you? Fix him for me. Is that an order or a friendly request? Only a friend would tell you to do this. Yes, sir. No peeping and no moving of lowerjaws. Anyone blowing the egg to an opponent win. Ready? Ready? Start! Hsiu, I'm on your side. Why tease me? Either we play today or never. Even if you were my master, I'd tease you. Amy... Terrific! Make fun of me? Stop that. Amy really is coming. I don't care about her. She really is coming. So what? It's you who don't care about me. Everything alright? Amy. What? How dare you lay hands on my girl? Protect me. Stop fooling around. Forget it! Outrageous! Bastard! How dare you? Anyone teasing Amy will get it. He's flaring up. What's the matter with you? It's alright. They're always so wild. Never mind them. Mr. Huang, stop him. What's you up to again? That bastard hit me. Don't go so wild, will you? Mr. Huang, now is the Happy Hour. We'll go on even if Madam ordered us to stop. Dare you even to tease me? Sorry, sir. We'll go down to accompany you. Good, you dared to fling me down. Come in! It really got into my head. Get me a cup of coffee, will you? Thank you. For me? I planned to give it to Shirley. Now I think it suits you better. It depends. How could it suit me? Not for tonight. As of tomorrow, you need to love Shirley. You're to work like a slave. You tease me last time. Well have some tear-gas. So you'll cry on your wedding day. Don't exaggerate. Okay, you win. Make way. Let me. No, you're clumsy. So much the better. Let me taste this nice cup of coffee. Your heart's weak. Don't drink coffee anymore. I only meant to fool them. You've fooled me too. No. Stop lying, tell me the truth. Do you love Shirley? If you don't say it, it means you don't. No, but... I still can't make up my mind after such a long time. I love her then. You're not sincere. Have you finished talking? Go now, They're pushing. I'll go then. Bye-bye! Really heartless, idiot. Take it off first. Right. Remember to collect the bride at 10 tomorrow. Wear a necktie. Thank you. Bye-bye. Try it at once. Really beautiful. The flower on the head is beautiful. Hsiu! Don't run. Hsiu! Call an ambulance at once! Hsiu... Shir... Shirley, I... Hsiu... What happened... C.I.D. Heavenly Father of all men. We pray especially for those we love but can't see any more. May you bless them and shine on them. May the love, wisdom and omnipotence, be demonstrated in them. We pray in Jesus' name, Amen. Why are you back from your leave? There's no point in taking leave now. Michael, I'm applying for return to duty. Good. Work may do you good. Master. I'm in trouble. You must help. You made things so bad. Who'd help you? Here's a potion of American ginseng. See if it will help. Don't move. Police. Yu, handcuff him. Don't move! Where's Swatow Hsiung? I don't know. Miss. I don't know... Speak up! I really don't know. You're his best friend! Speak up! Speak up! Are you going to speak or not? Maybe these 2 monsters may speak. Sorry, I don't know anything. Let's go. Don't, Mr. Big. Go over there! Don't scare madam. Be smart and speak. I really don't know. Don't blame me if your bottom gets burnt. Hear that? I really don't know. Well, are you going to speak or not. Speak up! Take off your pants! Take off your pants! You're not speaking? Scald him. Good. I enjoy doing it. You don't care a damn about me. Speak up! No? No? He's collapsed. His bottom's got burnt. That one outside may last longer. Okay, scald him. Give it to me. Take off your pants. I'll speak... I only know he's sailing tomorrow, but I don't know where. Keep away... Look, we've got so many complaint. You took action without my approval, used violence to hurt suspects. How can I protect you. Inspector Ho Hsueh-ling, you've let me down. Sorry, sir. What good to say sorry now? How long have you been in the police force? With your relationship with Hsiu, you shouldn't handle this case. We're legally... still unmarried. Shut up! To talk about law, we'll all die martrs. Vengeance makes us no different from rascal. You're unfit to be a policeman. Sorry, sir. Insp Ho's operation got my verbal approval. I know the whole thing well. Don't cover her up. I only feel that I've a responsibility. Good fix it then. If anything goes wrong again, mind your future. Yes, sir. I don't mind bearing the blame for you. But remember foolhardiness doesn't always work. Mr. Huang! Uncle Te, how's it? We've a glue. Swatow Hsiung will leave HK at Sam Mun Pier at two. Buddy, when will the ship sail? After these drums have been moved. Swatow Hsiung. Don't move! Sail quickly! Sail, or I'll shoot you dead. Release the rope. Brother, don't shoot, it's loaded with gasoline. My whole family's on it. Don't shoot. I beg you. Release the rope, faster! Go to hell! Don't move! You're violating the law. Terry, tell the bastard to bring the boat back to shore. Yu, keep the evidence on the spot and bring it back. Yes, Mr. Huang. Captain, show me your license and I.D. Not my fault, sir. Back to the shore. We'll take your statement then. I wanted to kill him too. No more. We're police. What are you doing? Old Te. I know the American ginseng case. Give me a chance. It's for everyone's good. Save your nonsense for the Tomb Festival. Mr. Huang... Fix all these. Mr. Huang, do you know the American ginseng case? Mr. Huang. Be smart and let me go or we'll both penrish. Kill me! See how you'll make your report. Get away... A snatcher... Don't move! Go and see him. Over here, you stay to watch him. Yes, Madam. Come here! Come here to mark the seat. Stop the others from coming. Old Te, were you scared? You need this gun for evidence. Oh. I forgot. He was stunned. This coffee came from my friend in Brazil. Try it. Thank you, sir. I've read the report on yesterday's incidence. Mr. Wei. We got no full marks, but I'm satisfied with the result. Had we captured on alive, we could get more clues. I like you for your serious attitude. You're already so busy. Take 2 days' leave. Thank you, sir. A fish has swallowed the bait. Go and see. A big fish. Even you've caught it, must be a stupid fish. So you're stupider! Is that possible? It's going to drop down. Catch it at once. Be careful... I've seen it. So it's a crafty fish. Is it? There's no lack of stupid fish. Let's catch. I daren't convey anything to you, but you can trust me. Let's me teach you yatching. Some day we'll cross the Pacific. Come! No... Turn... Which way. This away? Right. Turn. This way? Go on. I did it. Uncle Te. Yu, spend more time on Amy to strengthen the ties. I wish I could. But I'm a policeman. Excuse me. Okay! Bye-bye. This is Yu. What happened? Mr. Huang. I've caught Uncle Te dealing drug with foreigner. Impossible. It's true. I've the video tape for evidence. Let's make immediate action. What do you suggest? No, it could be complicated. Bring all the tapes to the station for me to see. Anything important? Nothing serious. I'll take you home. Let's go. Cindy wants me to remind you today is Amy birthday. I know. I know. See the cake and flowers is ready. Go and be pardon. What are you waiting for! Get in! Girls have to be soothed. I know, you nosey. Go now. Amy will be off duty soon. You're meddlesome. Only 15 minutes for fooling around. Two first class airtickets. Thank you. Thank you. Amy. Can I help you, sir? Yes. I want 2 tickets for a trip with my girlfriend. It's her birthday. Happy birthday! It's yours. What's it on the tape? Let me show it. What are you going to cook for me? Let's eat cakes after dinner. Don't touch my videotape recorder! Open the door. Open up! What are you doing? It's none of your business. Come out... Who told you to watch my videotape. Well, you're keeping such a serious thing from me. What is it? Are you taking me for your brother. Speak up... Uncle Te's your master, but he's keeping it from you. It means he doesn't trust me. Who knows? You're taking him for you dad. How do I know you're an accessory? Would I be an accessory to this? I went through everything with you and you suspect me? You're so impulsive. How could I tell you? It would only ruin you. What have you to fear now? I'm not afraid either. Be he a tiger, or my own dad. I'll take him if he sells drug. I'll go and arrest him right now. Let's go! Don't be so impulsive! Any rash action will ruin everything. Aren't we brothers? Listen this is only between me and Mr. Huang. And me. Yes...! Remember, don't take individual action if you discover anything. Okay? Bad. I must explain to Amy. Don't do anything foolish! Listen. It hurts! Go now, or I'll call the police and accuse you of trespassing. You must be joking. Who's joking with you? Amy. I won't see you anymore. Go away! My hand! You're not going? I will. What are you doing? Don't go. Are you taking me for a criminal? Yes. I sue you for willful damage to a policeman's pride. I must question you now. I've followed you all the way and kept saying 'sorry'. What else do you want? Mr. Fan, I want you to have some respect for me. You come to see me when you're in the mood. You leave me behind and say sorry when you're not. What are you taking me for? My girlfriend, worthy of my respect. Have my action to show how important you're to me. I'll keep you company till tomorrow morning. I'll quit as a policeman. Okay? No. I'll give you as a citizen to go out. I'll break with anyone else, but I won't let you go. Let me go! No, you mean everything to me. I can't cook if you don't let me go, jerk. Right, right, I must let you go. Let me see if you're hurt. A policeman gets more sentence for indecent assault. I couldn't care less. Yu, what are you up to? Come and help. I'm preparing a birthday gift for you. Come and eat. The big gift is here. Am I sweet? Take me. Disgusting... Shirley, have you got the key? Yes, but Hsiu never allowed me to open it, and I don't know what it contains. Did you give him this? He always kept everything to himself. Over $10 million! Lmpossible for a man of his family background! And these 2 passports! What are they for? This must be ill-gotten money. These passports are to help use another identity, to get out of HK, in case of need. Wish my reasoning was wrong. I've recently got a tip-off that, someone abused his power for dope-push. I thought he was honest. Shirley, I know how you feel. Please face up to reality. There's indeed something wrong with him, but I'll help you find out the truth. Buy a flag, sir... Follow that white car in front. Royal HK policeman, no more police affair. No, I'm all yours tonight. GET LOST. Police. Drop your gun! Drop your gun too, old Te. Terry, I... Stay to speak to the judge. Filing it to see. Get you handcuffs and put them on, those two foreigners. Terry. You're trafficking in drugs. As a policeman, you know the law and violate it. I was as hot-tempered when I was young. I understood. Why did you do that? I've followed you since I left school. I took you for my master, my dad, but now it's all over between us. You're under arrest. Arrest me? I was braver than you. What did I get for arresting some small frys. 2 lousy medals. When the weather's bad, it hurts and I can't sleep. They did it again once they got discharged. I am a small fry too. A small fry or a big shot. I don't care. Terry, you're still young and you're your idea. When you reach my age and are, in my straitened circumstances. You'll see how important money is. Shut up! Don't find an excuse for yourself. Terry, let me go. Sorry, Uncle Te. I know you're nice to me, but I've no choice. I caught Te dealing in drugs with 2 foreigners in Stephen Bay, Stanley. Come on. Stop...! Don't move, or you'll die. Sir, these 2 foreigners dealt in drugs with Uncle Te. I've got the tape for evidence. Well done! You're done a great credit. Handcuff Uncle Te. Yes, sir. I'll fix everything with your boss. Leave now. Okay! Why do you want to kill him? You'll die for sure if he doesn't. I'd rather go to jail... than to kill him. You're my best aide. I'll cover you up. I quit. Finish this case for me first. You know how to handle the things here. You gave personal assurance that, everything would be okay. Only about the stuff. I'm not your nanny. I've overassessed you. You can't even finish a kid. Now the co-operation is over between us. Our market in New York is so big. Many in HK would vie to be my sidekick. Okay, no problem. Listen, no one dare touch any deals I touched. Hong Kong is mine, and you're not the only market in USA. Get out of HK and return to New York. Hold it, Michael! I came here to make money, not to make enemy. Okay, I'll trust you one more time. Well, if you want co-operation, do one thing for me. I want 200 kilos of stuff tomorrow night. This is my A/C No., Credit the money into it. You'll g et the stuff tomorrow night. The killer can never get away. We can get hold of him for sure. Morning! What's wrong? Why are you all wearing a stone face? A bereavement? Ah Yu. Ah Yu, come in! Shirley, please go out for a while. Ah Yu, close the door please. I've ascertained Hsiu's drug-trafficking. Is that so? Does Shirley know it? I'm not too sure. Would she be an accessory? We must take more care from now on. I don't think Shirley has a hand on it. Here's a cassette of Te's drug-trafficking. It's of serious consequence. Formerly it was Hsiu, now it's Uncle Te. How many more are involved I don't know. Yu, have you got any other evidence? I've put a tape at Amy's. Is that so? Don't worry. Amy knows nothing about it. We must get it back as soon as possible. For Amy's safety, don't tell anyone about it. I know what to do. Shirley, please come in. Yu, I want to talk to you. Keep cool. Something happened last night. What is it? Come in. Mr. Huang. Shirley, put this important item in a safe. Aren't you afraid she might be Te's accompany. Impossible. Terry was killed yesterday. What? He knew about Old Te. I must go out for a while. Old Te, hold it! You creep! You ruined Terry. I'll kill you! Ah Yu. Are you crazy? Uncle Te's taking Terry for his own son. You're mistaken. Yu, don't get the wrong idea. He won't do that. Are you crazy. Stop! What happened? A policeman trafficking in drugs can do anything. Quiet! We're all friends. Let's talk it over. Let me go! I've proof of your drug-trafficking. I've already reported to Mr. Huang. I'll testify against you. Yu, don't be impulsive. You did report to me, but I can't accuse Te, before I see the evidence. It must be him. I've got tapes of your drug-trafficking. Nonsense. Shirley, run it for him. Run it for him. Don't... Run it. How come? Obviously the cassette has been swapped. What? Where's the evidence? You yourself are under suspicion. You're exposing your own crime. Last time Hsiu got killed because you planted a smoke bomb. This time Terry got killed because you abandoned your duty. What explanation can you give? Search his locker! I saw him putting heroin in... I also saw you put heroin into the locker. Let's search together. I'm not afraid. You're finished. Give me the key. Don't try anything foolish. Keep away! Uncle Te, the key! Pheasant. Sorry, Uncle Te. Keep cool. Don't mess around. Uncle Te, you really did it. You put aside my book and said it was missing. Will you search more thoroughly? We've searched everything. There's nothing. Let's search his home. Ah Yu, your locker... Open it and see. Okay. Search! You really did it. No. Yu, calm down. Are you going to tell me this is flour? This bag is not mine. Calm down. Believe me, Shirley, believe me. Now I won't trust anyone. I only believe in truth and evidence. You're arrested for drug possession. Shirley, I know Te is not alone in the frame-up. Soon I'll seek them out! Watch out. Do you mean us? Don't frame us. Don't get us involved because you're evil. Quiet, this is not a market. You're the Discipline Unit. I'll investigate the accusation between Yu and Uncle Te. You'll also be subject to internal investigation. I'm drug Investigation Special Operation Insp Ho. You're suspected of drug possession. What's your name? Fan Shun-yu. Occupation. A member of the Royal Hong Kong Police Force, with the Drug Investigation Dept of the Special Operations. Where do you live? You know it already. As a policeman, you should know... I know better in this respect. I've discovered heroin in your locker, how do you explain that? I was framed. Why should I explain? Possess no drugs, why should I be question. There's no evidence to support your state. You mean you've proof against me? Can you think of anything to prove your innocence? Law requires evidence. All your statement may be used as evidence in court. Okay, I'll give my statement. I deal in drugs, smuggling and, resort to killing, arson and robbery. Take it down as a matter of routine! Come on. Evidence in Court? Take it down! Ah Yu. My name is Fan Shun-yu, I don't know you. I suspect Insp Ho Hsueh-ling's conspiracy against me. Take it down! Sue me. The time is 20th Oct 1988 at 3 p.m. I'm Anti-Narcotics Bureau detective Fan Shun-yu No. 3368. I suspect my Sergeant Feng Chien-te of drug-trafficking. As a result of 3 days probe and trace. I've discovered him dealing in drugs with... 2 unidentified foreigners on a ferry, deduced that he used his detective identity, to cover up his trafficking activities. Mr. Huang. Mr. Huang? I'm Old Te, I've searched the whole house. There are many cassettes, but not the one you mention. Come back before we take any action. Any clues? Go back and take a rest. I'll take charge here. Mr. Huang. I believe you are innocent. Mr. Huang, you must help me on this. Who else knows the old Te case, besides me? Terry. You know Terry is impulsive. Now you've ruined him and yourself. The first thing is to prove your innocence. Take me to get the copy of cassette you mentioned. Don't you trust me? Shun-yu. Have you seen the cassette I taped yesterday? Yes. Besides Te, there's... Go on! Speak up! I don't know, I don't know anything. Do you know or not? I know nothing. The cassette is very important to Yu. Bring it if you know where it is. There's no such a cassette. There must be. I ran it on this VTR recorder last night. Have you ever taken it away? NO, I didn't even touch it. Just now you said got it. Without it, I can't clear myself. I'll be in jail. Do you know it or don't you? I know... Now get it. You don't want Yu to get into trouble. I promise. I'll quit once I'm cleared. I'm so scared! Why? It's okay if you find the cassette. Well, Yu, we must leave. Amy's going to be alright, I'll have someone watch her. I'm Michael, now at 5 Conduit Garden 26th floor. Send someone, a woman needs protection. Yu, we're in a hurry. Excuse me. Shun Yu, I want no protection. I'm alright, I'll return soon. Bye-bye! Let's go! Please call 3388, Amy urgent. Tell her to call my home. Mr. Huang, let's return to Hq Handcuff me. Okay, this will save us from unnecessary complaints. Bear with it now and soon you'll clear your's. Mr. Huang, sorry for the trouble. Don't mention it. Mr. Huang, it was these foreigners who deal with Te. Turn around and arrest them! Amy, what happened? Shirley, Michael masterminded Te's dope-pushing. He won't do that. It's true. He just took that cassette away, I'm scared. Keep calm, don't go away. Tell me in detail. Michael mastermined Te's dope-pushing. Believe me... Stop! Come in! Why are you coming to see me at this hour. You're depressed, don't drink so much. After so much has happened, go for a pleasure tour. Amy spoke to me over the phone before her dead. Is that so? What did she say to you? Yu is innocent of drug possession. A big shot is behind Te's drug-trafficking. Who? You should know better. Yes, I got Amy's phone too. You did drug-trafficking with Yu. Now I really understand you. Are you a human being? After all these, and you want to make me the scapegoat. I can say it is you who want to make me the scapegoat. Yes, with my name and position in the police force, my words will convince everyone. Now listen, I Michael Huang am a drug-trafficking. What have got anything to accuse me of it. I've a copy of Te's drug-trafficking tape. I've a copy too. His crime is not linked with me. I can testify against you. Testify against me? That tape even if released to the world won't serve any purpose, because only Te can testify against me. Vincent, yes, I'm Michael. Finish off Te right away. I'll hand the stuff over to you in person. We've been getting on well because you're obedient. But, unfortunately... Mr. Feng, telephone. Yes, speaking. The long distance call from Canada is connect. Thank you. Darling. Daddy. Yes. What is it? I'll fly to Canada at 7 tomorrow morning. What? The Hq has approved my early retirement for health reasons. Have you received my remittance? Don't move. Old Te... No monkey business! Hell with you! Damn, I'll kill you... Kill... Let's go. Have you found out everything? This resignation letter has explained everything. I'm extremely sorry, I didn't discover my subordinate's misbehavour... till now. I ready for disciplinary action and investify. But I've a request. I wish I could arrest these men myself. I hope Mr. Wei will give me this chance before I leave. Good, go ahead. Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentleman, we've ample evidence against. Insp Ho., Serg Feng and detective Fan for drug-trafficking.
