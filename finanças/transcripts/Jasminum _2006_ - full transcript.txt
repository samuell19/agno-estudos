The first sentence is always the hardest I?m five years old and don?t know how to tell stories like this Just straight forward maybe? JASMINUM The year 1617 The coffins ... ?Praise the Lord. ?To eternity. Wild cherry, Bird cherry, and Plum tree? Plum tree, Wild cherry and Bird cherry. This is brother Sanitas, the cook. 30 years in the monastery. Go away! The mouse Gelsomina, two years in the monastery. Learning acrobatics, damn. Piglets: Athos, Porthos, and Aramis ... One month in the monastery. Brother Sanitas doesn?t know them so well yet. A little cheese. Sanitas food chain: First he feeds the animals, then the people and finally himself. I?m not in the chain yet, but much will change when I arrive. ?Pudding? ?Yes. With potatoes. Delicious. ?Anton?wka?apple. ?Oh, no, it?s a McIntosh apple! The only kind you can bribe brother Wild cherry with. Seventeen years in the monastery. Sparingly ... It?s time, right? I hang the keys to the crypt here. Brother Bird cherry is rearing fragrant ducklings. 20 years in the monastery. In a minute. Brother Plum tree ? soon an actor. Four years in the monastery. He secretly gives brother Sanitas a small stick of fragrant hair. Wild cherry has the keys. I?ll go now ... with sadness. Roch ... My dear Roch ... A saint, you? What a saint ... The ceiling is full of holes ... Not enough for lunch. ?Saints? ... Butter, oil, buckwheat, grits ... ... rice, meal ... Eggs ... and matches. St. Roch has been at the monastery since I do not know when. Saint Roch ... The Holy Virgin is also in need of refurbishment. But decisions like that are made considerably higher up. Very funny ... My mother, Natasha. She is a great artist. This is me ? Eugenia. No nicknames, please. ?Acrobat ... ?Father Kleofas. Prior. 20 years in the monastery. Zampano ? he was an acrobat. And Fred Astaire, too. Gelsomina, then? My God ... Fellini ... What a world it was. Sure, but Zampano was never an acrobat. Rather an athlete, like brother Wild cherry. Come in. ?Praise the Lord. ?To eternity. A note again? You have not sworn a vow of silence. ?The sacred images are restored, thanks St. Roch. ? What? I see no difference. The addressee is wrong. St. Roch is the patron of cattle. You may ask for milk ... No, silence. St. Roch here and St. Roch there. ?This is a closed convent. What are you doing here?? I restore paintings. I?m here to restore the altarpiece. ?Our vigilance is very strict: no talking, no common meals.? ?No common prayers, either.? I would not eat with you, just doing my job. But I want to eat. ?Good morning. ?Good morning. ?Where are you going? ?To the kitchen. Can you bring bread and butter for Genie? Why are you looking at me like that? Her name is Genia. Eugenia Antosia. Bring Genia out to the kitchen and give her bread and butter. I have read your rules and talked to Father Provinsial. He had no objection. Come on. Well ... Why restore paintings? For what purpose? It?s a waste of strength. ?Why waste? ?They mend themselves, of course ... ... by a miracle. ?Why aren?t you skipping? ?Why should I? Just becuase. Our Prophet Barnabas described it. Here: ?The saints? faces on images shall come to life and the Garden of Eden shine. ? ?I am sending you, brothers, fragrant as trees??? ? ?On that you may recognize the saint among them.? ?His name is a mystery; His suffering is great??? ? ?And His Holiness precedes falling.? ?He falls before he resurrects and finds the way.? ? How do you know? ? I have done my homework. This text is from 1617. I have calculated the miracle takes place quite soon. Perhaps in a week or a month. St. Bird cherry shall achieve the miracle. Saint Bird cherry? ?Who else? I understand. Here are the documents. Too thin. ?What do you mean? ?Too thin. Are you surprised? Too thick. I have lost two teeth. See? Yes. ?How thick should the slice be, then? ?This thick. ?This? ?This. Not enough butter. ?Too little? ?Yes, does it surprise you? This was how my next adventure with mother began. This time in a monastery with fools. But brother Butter didn?t smell like fruit. I wanted to be with him, although I would be sad later. Wonder if he can burp? ?Now I?ll burp. ?Can you belch? ?No. ?Are you there, Genie? ?Yes, she is! Mom wanted to learn about those scents. I was sure she would smoke?? and nagging at that Butter Man. Do they really smell? How come? The monks Wild cherry, Bird cherry, Plum tree. Their scent affects women. They learn to snuggle up and take a whiff kiss. However small. And she succeeded. We got Plum tree?s stick. And a piece of Wild cherry?s frock. And Bird cherry? ?Nothing. ?A real talker, huh? ?Yes. Sandel Oil ... Cinnamon Bark ... The mouse ... ?On the bed. ?On the bed. Bergamot, pallet sheets. ?Moose ... ?On the bed. The first night Brother Sanitas gave us half a loaf of bread, and butter. He probably thought that we ate nothing else. Look, chemistry and physics, instead of miracles. ?And the same result. ?There you?re wrong, my child. A divine intervention affects both the painting that?s restored ... ?... And its surroundings. ?Pardon? The people ? us. ?Such a miracle is a little like a movie. ?A movie? Yes. A film is a kind of miracle. It lives in people in a similar manner, and in similar places. ?Where? ?Here, in the heart. ?It can conjure up the same results. ?For example? Even conversion. It was long ago you went to the movies, Father ... Yes, it?s been a long time. They closed the movie theater here in Jasm?nowo. It wasn?t worth it the trouble. But we contribute to the world of film. ?I know. A very famous actor. ?Yes. She draws beneath the window. That?s right. I draw in many different places. Nothing strange about that. ?Something important? ?No. The scent of jasmine occurred on the third day, ?but there was no jasmine bush nearby. Jasmin? One for Wild cherry and Plum tree. And now one for dad. Leave me alone. I can?t, I told you. ?Maybe one for mum, then? ?You want me to puke? One for Genie, then? One for Genie. Yes, it worked. Plums. Eau de Cologne for schoolgirls. Wild cherry. Perfume for the interior design shops. Bird cherry ... Bird cherry? That night we got the missing scent from Sanitas. A Bird cherry duck. Now I take a bit of your fragrance ... Okay? He stole it from Bird cherry, while he levitated. A levitating saint is so concentrated on himself, ?that he doesn?t notice the surroundings ? to Sanitas? advantage ... What now? Get up! Get up! Bird cherry? ?Are you there, Sanitas? ?Here I am. ?What are you doing? ?Nothing. ?Why are you wearing glasses, then? ?What glasses? ?Here, a duck. ?Don?t you want it? ?Yes, but it shits everywhere. ?Just like a duck should. ?Do you have fresh bread? ?Yes. Then we?ll eat breakfast. ?You tried to smoke a bit on the sly ... ?Sorry. ?No problem. ?Yes, it damages the paintings. ? I should not smoke. ? Speaking of paintings ... How is the work with the Holy Virgin progressing? Look. Leave something for my brother Bird cherry. Of course. You have many pictures here. ?You are not a believer. ?Who knows? It does not matter. Everything emits a scent. Jill Sander No. 4. Bergamot, tuberous, heliotrope and other components. ?Could you explain it? ?Not everything. How can a man smell like a fruit tree? I don?t know. And why does this scent attract women ? ... and create opportunity of temptation and sin ... ... purely theoretically, of course ... ?It?s not the scent itself. ?I know what pheromones are. But they explain nothing. Bird cherry spread his fragrance, but not Wild cherry? I know you want to give a comprehensible response, but of a different kind. And do you know of which? ?No, but soon. I have written down my observations. ?Pardon? ?Charts. ?May I? Here? ?Go ahead. I watch the fragrant brothers and note every step they take ? ?on this topographic map. Forward, backward, to the left, to the right ? ?While they clear the weeds and picking carrots. Everything. This will lead me somewhere. They seem to create a pattern, a drawing. In all cases, it?s something for the Vatican. St. Bird cherry. You are not a believer. We?ll wait and see. Don?t crap on St. Roch, damn. Have you heard from Bird cherry? Nothing? Didn?t I say it clearly? I can?t help it. For sure. This is all I have. It?s not theirs. What do you need them for? Only Bird cherry is good enough. I?ve already used everything you gave me. ?I don?t want to live without the scent. ?Why not? Don?t you get it? This scent makes me into somebody else. When I wear it I?m better and more beautiful. And not just a slut ... This is for Muszyna from Plum tree ? for the attic. From Wild cherry to Mrs Gralowa ? for the wardrobe. ?And what about me? ?I don?t know. Maybe in a week. What?s that? What do you mean? Money? I?ve already told you. There is a collection box in the church. Do I look like a bank teller? Do I? Do I look like an animal breeder? I received the piglets. But who will kill them when they get big? Damn! Coffee, tea, sugar, matches. Coffee, tea, sugar, matches, yes. Some monastery barter? What do you mean ?bartering?? Coffee, tea, sugar ? everything goes into the kitchen, ma?am. Have you seen the banker?s boot? Why Sanitas became so angry about the piglets? Mom did not know either, but did she ask him why? What is it in the smell that is so addictive? ?Did you see that woman?s eyes? ?I don?t see women in their eyes. Won?t you tell? Some must be included; but not everything. Not everything? ?Half. ?Of what? Everything. We did not find out anything. Please, go away. Chemistry ... Maybe not just chemistry? Please, stay. ?Sorry. ?Why? ?Is something wrong? ?Not at all. ?Thank you. Sorry. ?Go ahead. ?Because you put yourself at risk? ?It was you who was in danger. ?I?m Patricia. ?Natasha. I restore paintings at the monastery. I know. It?s a small town. Can not find a nicer fiance? That?s not what I want. ?What do you want, then? ?That which all women are looking for. ?Love. ?How did you know? ?Life. And what have you found? ?I don?t know. Love, perhaps, but of a strange kind. I flee from it. I?m afraid. It?s so strong. The aroma ... scent and something associated with it. Power, ecstasy, mystery ... ?Did you see me at the monastery? ?Yes. I can not live without the smell. I also compose fragrances. ?You can have it. ?Scents? And paintings, then? I raise them. I go into their blood. They are young and I get older. But the smells ... They are a kind of compensation. They make me live. I learn from them. I read, looking ... ?For what? ?Please ... Scents has power over you, too. Wouldn?t you also possess such power? Can you compose such a smell? Roch, Roch ... Don?t even ask. It?s a misery. The hens lay barely eight eggs a week. Ducklings are growing slowly. The onion starts to run low, like peas and potatoes. I may have to give away the piglets. They look at me like ... Thank you for the Holy Virgin. Can?t you ask those up there to watch over the little girl? Genie. How beautiful. Not bad. It may be satisfactory. But what?s the point? The Holy Virgin becomes clearer. But our prayers, will they be more sincere? What is that? ?A swing. ?A swing? ?What are you going to do with it? ?The child must have a swing. Cinema Smile ?Are you there, Sanitas? ?Here I am. I bought these shoes for you. Take those off. Now, now. The other one, too. Put these on. Here, shoe polish. Brush them. And he did, but he wanted to keep his old shoes anyway. ?What beautiful shoes. ?Bird cherry?s first words in ten years. Yes. ?What is that? ?Sage. It is made out of olives, paraffin oil and fragrance oils. We oil the sheets, tangle you up in them ? And wait until the oil has absorbed your fragrance. ?And then? ?Then we squeeze the oil out of the sheets ... ... loaded with your body odor. And a little Bird cherry Scent. And then the perfume is ready. ?But ... ?Yes? You have to concentrate, so your body will produce pheromones. ?On what? ?I don?t know. On erotica and stuff ... ?Dirty thoughts? ?Yes, it?s the only way. This is getting really fun. What are you thinking of? Of shameful things. Of one of the monks at the monastery. But in my fantasy he gets a of the Jasm?nowo actors? faces. ?He is handsome ... ?Zeman. ?Do you know him? ?Everybody does. I imagine that Bird cherry?Zeman ... ... both monk and actor, hugs me. ... parts my lips, kisses me ... Then he begins to undress me ... And then ... Oops ... ?Should I fetch Zeman? ?What? Zeman? Bring him to Jasm?nowo? A dead cinema. A corpse. Do you sense the sweet odor? Such smell the dead. Yes. I know something about odors. And about projectors. Xenon tube. The very latest. ?It has hardly been used. ?Pity. ?Who told? ?The hairdresser. Patricia ... And what are you doing here? I am restoring a painting at the monastery and protect it. At the monastery? Father Kleofas used to love film. He saw every single one. After the seance he sat alone and looked at the empty canvas. As if he was praying. I didn?t want to disturb him. Which was his favorite movie? This one. Fellini?s ?Amarcord?. What? Bird cherry?Patricia; mixed with alcohol and cigarette smoke. The best fragrance that mom ever put together. ?What a wonderful fragrance. ?And remember ... It is to open the cinema and invite Zeman there. Just a touch ... Lord ... I pray Thee, Lord, even if it is hopeless ... Without You my world is no more. Brother Wild cherry, brother Plum tree. I confess now, before you, that I for 20 years ? ?Instead of praying, have despaired and sought oblivion rather than God. Pray for me, because I can?t help it. That?s how everything came to light. Twenty years of magic tricks. ?Excuse me ... if you can. ?Yes. ?You broke your vow of silence of course! ?Not me, you. I have never obtained a promise. I was silent for so many years ? ?Just because I didn?t have anything to say. Only once did I say: ?Go away!? To the dark one we could not see? To a woman? ?And who threw the stones? ?Stones? Surely it was gravel. ?What is she doing here? Why is she here? ?She wants to get closer. ?To what? ?Love. ?Brother Sanitas? ?Yes. ?You are a true saint. ?Really? Sit still. In time, as usual, mayor. Patricia, your scent is seductive. This doesn?t bode well for me ... Not if you slap me on the butt again. Haircut, shaving and other pleasures? The day began okay Sanitas finally managed to capture the hen when it layed eggs under the altar. Unfortunately, this was the only good news that day. Don?t cry. Eggs, ducks, ants, And St. Stefan in person. You can not save everyone. Don?t cry, I said. You?ll get St. Roch. Take it, pea brain. God bless you, but it can?t be Roch. ?Why not? ?Because ... ?Here I have carrots. ?So? Brother Bird cherry has escaped. I see that. Time for a reprimand; Otherwise, our world comes to an end. Father Kleofas. Problems ... ?Did you paint it wrong? ?Oh no. What?s the matter, then? Run to Sanitas and get bread and butter. ?Hey. ?Hey. It was quieter here before. Fewer cars. ?It doesn?t disturb you? ?No. Very beautiful. You seem to have found yourself in the work. ?The pleasure is not for all. ?Not all, no. ?And you, father? ?My service gives me joy. ?I write down my observations. ?Quite many lately. St. Bird cherry seems to have escaped you. From me? From us, right? ?Excuse me? ?You knew him. You knew he was here and you came here for his sake. ?Do you think that? ?Yes. ?Was there anything else? ?I wonder if ... I believe you once loved him. And that he has hurt you. ?Do you believe that? ?Yes. Love is for the people and we are human beings. There?s nothing strange with that? I know. You think we forgot that we live here isolated from the outside world. It may seem so. I wanted to see him in the eye. We had wedding rings. Mom came home from the hospital. She was seriously ill. The church was bursting. At least a hundred people. Mom was so moved when she heard the organ music. She must have had a premonition. But he ... ... never turned up. He fled, just like today. Four days later, Mom died ... And I had no one. I was all alone. Fragrance of Oblivion. The nose can make us remember and it can make us forget. The grass when it is wet, autumn bonfires ... ... apple trees, dew ... Could work ... Oblivion Come in. May I? ?Have you been crying? ?No. I don?t remember. Is it new? ?Oblivion?. May I try? No, it is uninteresting. A fragrance that will conjure up relief. I prefer to remember. What happened to the mayor? Zeman arrives tomorrow to look at the movie theater Now they?ve separated the orphans. What happens now? ?Don?t you want my Roch? ?No. ?Why not? ?It?s very simple. Hold this, please. Read. First is St. Sylvester, then Evertius, John of Nepomuk. And in fourth place: Stephan. I find my strength in the saints ... They give meaning to my life. Roch is not one of them. I go out to the kitchen. ?I?m coming! ?Sure ... ?Hey. ?Hey. Hello. It is Patricia?s merit you?re here today. ?Pardon? ?Patricia. ?Where?s the theater? ?Just around the corner. On the other side of the square. Great. ?I don?t know this one. New Chanel? ?Pardon? Don?t touch the car! ?Blow your nose. ?What? Blow your nose. What a humiliation. He did not even look at me. That bitch clung to me. What an asshole. ?The mayor became excited. ?Everything excites him. ?I don?t know. ?You do, right? Promise that you compose that scent. I must have it. ?You promise? ?I promise. That was easier said than done. Mom realized what it took in the scent? ?but she didn?t know where to find the ingredient. And then I suggested our brother Sanitas. ?Praise the Lord. ?To eternity. Why are you on the wrong side? I?m on the right side. I want to be your customer. Really? ?What is your concern? ?Yes, what are my worries? I know nothing about that. Really? Why did you open the gates then? I prepare the lunch here. Lunch? Lunch, dinner, everything. You?re cooking and I compose fragrances. ?A brief lecture? ?Sure ... This is the scent ideogram, a triangle. Here is the head, here is the heart ... And depth ? the house of fragrances. Here I have light fruity tones: bergamot, lime. Scent tones: ... nice and short-lived. Then I also have these: Bird cherry with ambergris, the scent?s base? ?Strong and stable. But what is missing is: The heart?s fragrance. Do you really want to find it? What?s the matter? In 1605 ... ... Mikolaj Wolski placed the brothers here. Three of them smelled nice. In the spring of 1617, they all died, on the same day ... This began a new tradition: Some brothers took their name and body odors. It proved relatively easy. In the crypt, the brothers were just kneeling at the oldest brothers? coffins. And after a few minutes they smelled like Russian perfume ... After death, they lost their scent forever. But the first ones smell yet. If you therefore want to solve the mystery ... ... find the answer in the crypt. There you have your poetry. Now you must follow your nose. Prunus, Prunus padus, Prunus Avium ... The oldest brothers: Wild cherry, Plum tree, Bird cherry. Yes, just like perfumes. Lots of scents, but nothing more. What did you expect? I don?t know. That special thing. Heart. It?s missing here. Can?t you sense it? It?s missing. Sometimes there is something between ?to be? and ?not exist?. Jasmine? Jasmine. Continue. Jasmine. Ille erat domus. Ego sum pectus. Tu nos conectus. Ille erat domus, ego sum pectus, tu nos conectus. He was the house, I?m the heart. You reunites us. Right? What choice did she have? The eyes in the coffin was staring at her. She mixed Bird cherry-duck?s tincture with that of Jasmine's cover. I had had enough of the smells and the sad stories. Not for children. I know. You want to know if I saw the coffin with the woman in it. I did. Is it a shameful story? Well, maybe so ... Our Order would not eagerly publish it. ?The story is already 400 years old. ?And it conceals enough love ... You are so right. She was the daughter of a valet, one dressed-up upstart. And he ? Prunus padus, was the son of a wealthy landowner. When they fell in love with each other the father became furious. Many complications later, Bird cherry ended up here ? And the maid was left outside the walls ? ?In a pit covered with leaves. She lived on the leftovers from the monastery kitchen. And ten years after she died of exhaustion and love. The brothers were merciful and gave her the last resting place in the crypt. Or rather ? they dug a pit for her in the annexe. They go there sometimes to take of her energy in the prayer ? ?At the very special place. ?It?s a beautiful story. ?It would be a good scenario. Couldn?t the film be called ?Jasminum?? ?I don?t know. ?An action movie perhaps? ?Does brother Sanitas get into trouble now? ?How so? He just showed what was already there. This should not be punished. ?The horse? ?Yes. Feed corn, chaff, bran. He is pleased that it?s in the bite ?At an apple he would never sneeze ?Full he trots around and smiles On Sundays, he gets sugar, when everyone is in church. I had forgotten. ?The cow. ?The cow. Hay in winter, Grass in summer. ?For breakfast ? beets. ?Beets. ?When he?s old, he looks at snow. ?Why the snow? So the milk will be white And the kids will grow ?Very funny. ?Surely it was? A little. ?The Mole. ?The Mole. ?Is this an animals interrogation? ?Yes. ?Did you pass? ?I failed my mole test. The mole eats underground. His regular menu? Everything but ... ?We?ll go soon. ?His favorite dish ... ?In about two days. ?... Is pork and worms. ?How do I look? ?Not bad. Jasmine. Lovely. Scent of Love. It allows you to hurt somebody. This is nothing to joke about. Do not forget. Jasminum. Scent of Love. I shouldn?t say anything now ... Just one thing: The smell worked. Natasha. Natasha! I?ve got it! When I picked up this drawing the sun was shining. Then I realized what is happening with stained glass. And what is it? ?Don?t you know? Not here, there. Hold it, please. ?The saint is approaching? ... ?Gaze down? ... Wait ... ?stulte? ... ?Brother Sanitas is Latin. ?No ... Brother Sanitas, what?s ?stulte? in Latin? ?Idiot? or ?fool?. ?Do you know Latin? ?Yes. ?Why haven?t you said anything? ?What for? ?The saint is approaching, fool. Look down and you shall see him.? And his name is ... And so escaped the saint ... Closed. There is no need to knock. She disappeared with that actor. Like the movies. He was just crazy about her. ?What a shame you could not see it. ?Real shame. What should I do with this cinema? Thank you. The salon was redecorated, the screen was like new, new projector ... It had become such a special feature show. So special. Special? ?We make a new one that surpasses this. ?How? We will think of something. No, I do not smoke. Cinema Zeman There once was a little boy ... ... who so wanted to be loved. The only thing you do with your life ... ... is to look for love ... A human is fragile ... ... so full of confidence. She?s an easy target. Many a time I thought it was love, but it was always something else. And I suffered from the emptiness I found. And suddenly ... ... well, the eternal hope ... ... that one day, somewhere ... ... so would she, the only ... ... the best ... ... my prospective, wait for me. He?s crazy ... He has given me a car, a gold watch ... He says he can?t live without me. And you know what? I?m also a little crazy. This was what I was looking for, right? And what about your love? Cheers to love. ?My God, St. Roch. ?And? Are you surprised? Be seated. Take them off. The other also. You let the birds shit on my head. ?What can I do about it? ?Prohibit it. ?I throw stones at them. ?And? ?They just continue to shit. ?Then you have to be stricter. And why do you lift the piglets up? ?For them to see the sky. ?Can?t they do that on their own? If they could, I wouldn?t lift them. They have such short necks. They can?t lift their heads up. I walked around in Sanitas? dream just as he wanted. I was useful, because St. Roch didn?t understand anything about anything. ?Was there anything else? ?The duck. ?The duck? ?Yes, are you surprised? ?Forbid the birds to relieve themselves.? How? And then one day when mom wasn?t here, Sanitas disappeared ... And Wild cherry and Plum tree didn?t say a word. Why aren?t you saying anything? Say something. Natasha? Mother joined their body odors, and Sanitas their coffins. Now they could be together to the end of time. I loved to come here ? For your sake. Did you set fire to the place? Yes. The day after Mom died. My life?s largest fire. Everything went up in smoke. Even my wedding dress. The dress was beautiful. What a shame you never got to see it. I was going to church ... ... to get married. It?s true. ?On foot? ?Yes, in a suit and with a small bag. I arrived at the church, but it was a different church. The brothers did not believe their eyes ... They tried to get a car, so I would come to the wedding, but ... ?You stayed here. ?Yes. But not out of fear. Not only out of fear, I mean. What are you looking for? You smell of jasmine. Don?t be fooled. It?s just perfume. ?Will you return to the monastery? ?No, I remember too much. ?Forbid? ... They are cunning, of course. I will not prohibit the birds anything. Should I close their behinds up with clothespins? ?Forbid? ... If you are so shrewd, ban the girl from leaving here. Sanitas! Sanitas! These are my gifts to you. Put these in your bag: A button and a lock of my hair. I have but one wish. Give it to Bird cherry ? if he returns. Okay. Fragrance of Oblivion to Bird cherry. And what do I get? That is how you do it. ?Can I hitch a ride? ?Sure. ?Where are you going? ?To Warsaw. But I?ll be back as soon as I?m done with all my films. ?For I am ... you know ... ?Madly in love. ?How did you know? ?Everybody talks about it. ?You aren?t a journalist or anything? ?No. Yes, I?m in love and want to be with her. We can fix that. Here or someplace else. As long as we are together. ?Don?t you believe me? ?No. Does it surprise you? ?No. Not at all. ?He was really not surprised. Yes, I hear ... I hear ... I hear ... Holy Mother of God ... Holy Mother of God! Good God. What is this? Are you crazy? Holy Mother of God. Are you crazy? I have to light the fire. This was how St. Roch got some order in the destruction: Bird cherry returned to the ducks, and we got our saint Sanitas. What?s so strange about a monastery without a cook?
