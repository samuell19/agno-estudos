Can I look now? No, not yet. Okay, you can look now. Happy birthday to you... Happy birthday to you... May you live for a hundred years... What's wrong? I love you. Come. Come on! Come on, let's swim all the way to the sunrise! Julia! What does it mean to be human? Our genome contains over 20,000 genes... And three billion base pairs... That make us into who we are. But in their smallest components... They are genetic switches... That tell the genes to be on or off. 1 or 0. Imagine a future... Where you won’t have to worry about diseases... Like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. Imagine being able to see, even if you were born blind. If we manage to prove... That the properties of the Influenza virus... Can slow down the aging process in the yeast spores... It would lead to breakthroughs we can't even begin to imagine. Sure, but we can't... Julia... We can't keep doing the same tests... If we’re not getting any results. It will work! If only we could try to modify the cell cultures... We won't have time for that! We could try using Bio-bricks. The Italian scientists I've been talking... Julia, when you have graduated... You can do whatever the fuck you want! But we have to deliver results! If the institute loses their patience they will withdraw our grants. Bergman. If we try to use the enzyme Julia has been working on... Rebecca! We've been working on this... Since you started assisting me. We're so fucking close now! Erik! Great to see you. Are you alright? Yeah, I'm a lot better... Okay... Let's do this. Rebecca, add IGF-1 to 37B... But leave 37C neutral. How is the cell culture pH? It's at 7.3, right where we want it. Erik, will you check the code? The DNA-simulation looks good. Has the code been compiled? I wrote some new functions to modify the amino acids. Otherwise it's the same we've always been working on. You can just run it. Erik, turn off the safety checks. We have to increase the intensity. Do it. How many becquerel are we at? It's increasing rapidly! Shut it down! Wait! Julia! Shut it down! Not yet! Wait! Shut it down Julia! Fuck! The samples are destroyed! Julia what the hell are you up to!? Robert, wait! But he died in the last episode... Come on Rebecca, no damn spoilers! It's in the books. It's not a spoiler. How is it my fault that you can't read? Let's throw away the cell cultures and sterilize. What if we could have gotten it to work? We could have really made a difference... Do you want to try again? No... It's not working. The hypothesis doesn't hold. Damn it Rebecca. You don't spoil that kind of stuff. It's Sean Bean... So? He always dies... Check this out. No... Yes! It's so damn funny! One of the cell cultures... It's still alive... That's not possible. Which one is it? If the radiation didn't kill them... They should have reached the Hay-flick limit. Something has to be wrong. What the fuck... It's over the Hay-flick limit! The cells are still dividing! Close the door... If this is correct, then it's insane! Run the tests again... Holy Shit... If we could transfer the genetic modification to plants... We could get fruit and vegetables to age a lot slower. If food lasts longer we could reduce the amount of global transport. We could... we could split the planet's resources more fairly... It would be a huge step forward... To reduce hunger and starvation! Let's just keep testing and see how far we can take it! Erik... Do you think I could wear this at the Nobel Award dinner? I'm sorry honey, I'm really tired. Are you coming to bed? Yeah, I'll be there in a second... If the University doesn't support us on this... Then one of the large companies will. Yeah, probably but then they will patent everything. And we will lose all control. What the hell is this? Why haven’t you said anything? How long have you known? Honey, I... How long have you known? I didn't want you to... I didn't want you to get worried. Are you stupid? I thought you were doing okay now! Let go of me! Honey! The cancer is aggressive. And they discovered it way too late. Listen to me... No, I'm not going to listen now... The tumors are spreading. There is nothing they can do anymore. It was too late. It was too late. Let go! Julia listen to me! I didn't want to hurt you. I didn't want to scare you! Julia. Honey. Honey! Honey... My dearest love... I didn't know how to tell you. There has to be something they can do! They can't do anything. That's why I didn't want to tell you... How much time do you have? I don't know... Weeks, maybe months. Please forgive me. Forgive me. It's not your fault... This is anything but your fault. But there has to be something we can do. We could... we could use the enzyme on... - Yes! If we... - Honey... The experiment... We're not even close to animal trials! It's too long until then... I don't have that time anymore. I don't have that time. Honey, please listen to me now. Listen to me. I don't want to die in hospital. I'm not going to let you die at all. What do you mean you can't help him? I am his family! But there has to be something! Alright number nine. Your turn. I don't get why you're in such a hurry. I don't want to go to more mouse funerals. Come on. Before Bergman gets here. He's never here on Thursdays. Don't worry. Well, Mr. Jingles looks like he's alright... Erik... If there was a way... To cure you... There isn't... We can't do this! Do you have a better idea? Draw a blood sample and put it in the centrifuge. Rebecca! Help me! We don't know what could happen! Alright. Then you can leave. Erik will die if we don't do something. And I'm not just gonna sit here and watch! Alright... Do you have the code? It's on the USB stick. I copied Bergman's file structure. Are you seeing anything? Wait, it's analyzing... When we find the right base pair... We can insert the modified proteins into Erik's DNA. Julia, we don't even know how the mice react to this. There! Look at the genetic structure. Add the enzyme. Okay... The serum is prepared... Erik... I... Do it. What is the worst that could happen? It's not binding... It takes time for the blood to circulate through the body... Maybe we can... Julia... It's okay. Fuck. Erik, are you alright? What the hell is happening? You have to lie down! Erik! What is happening!? Don't touch me! Don't touch me! Erik... Rebecca? Where have you been? I've been trying to call you. My phone is broken... Is something wrong? No... You know that you can always talk to me... I have to go. Erik! Erik? Erik!? Erik! Erik, we have been looking everywhere for you. Do you hear that? It's the high voltage power lines... What are you talking about? I can hear it! Erik... you need help. Calm down. Come down from there. Erik... Erik! Oh my God. Are you okay? Try to breathe. What the hell? What is happening to you? What the heck... Where did you come from? Shit! It worked! Your modified genes are killing the cancer cells. Faster than they can multiply. Damn Rebecca, can you check the fuse? The grey box in the hall. I know where it is Julia. Erik take care of your damn baseball bat! Let there be light! Alright, everything is set up now. Great. Boot things up. Hold on! Thirsty? Throw me one. I knew it. Erik I'm not so sure you should be drinking right now... Come on Julia! Don't you see how cool this is? Erik is turning into a superhero... What's happening to you... Must have something to do with the cells renewing faster. Like your body is being overclocked or something. So that’s why I have x-ray vision? You're an idiot. Erik... Even if the cancer seems to have stabilized... We need to keep testing. So we know we that we can actually control this. If this can save you... Imagine what else it could lead to! Alright... cheers for the guinea pig then! So where do we start? From the beginning. I wonder if you're also aging slower... How old do people get nowadays? Seventy? Eighty? The oldest get to around 120. If we can develop a treatment that makes everyone 120... People would pay anything! They'll just keep increasing the retirement age... I can't wait to work until I'm a hundred. If people live that long, pension funds will run out anyway. Well it can't be any less money than the student grants... It will all work out. Noodles can be cooked in lots of exciting ways. There won't be any noodles... If everyone lives that long, resources will run out. There wouldn't be enough food. The planet would get overpopulated within a few years. I've always wanted to live on Mars anyway. A small cabana by the beach. You'd get an awesome tan. Why are you going to settle for Mars? If we can get astronauts to live forever... We could colonize the entire solar system. We're talking about scientific breakthroughs... And all you think about is fucking a Martian! You don't even like video games! Tell me what you hear. This is too much. I can't do this. Try. This won't work. I hear everything! Please try... Stop listening to everything at once. I hear birds. Wind in the trees. Waves. There is a beach nearby. You can't record this! Why not? Have you not seen Cloverfield and Blair Witch? Don't you know what happens to people... Who videotape an experiment? I just wanted to document... Yeah and at first everything will go well... Uh huh... Then suddenly all the monsters show up! And then we meet our terrible fate! This is insane! We should test it on someone else... To see if it has the same effect... Not yet. It's too dangerous. I can hear your heartbeat. I think I can control it now... This is Julia's answering machine... Erik... Hold on... Erik! Would it be so terrible if you got pregnant? It would be awesome. We could get a house out here to renovate... The kids could get their own rooms. We'd get one of those trampolines. They could play there... While you and I get old and wrinkly together. I have everything I want, right here. Erik! He's here! He's here! Welcome home Erik! Rebecca what the hell is this!? Everyone's here for Fredrik! It's just a little party. You know how to have fun right Julia? Or have you forgotten? Rebecca we have the experiment here! Everyone's drunk! No one cares about your experiment. Relax. Have some fun. Dance with me! Please don't ruin this... What are you doing!? We're just dancing... Just dancing? You're unbelievable. You're bleeding. I'm not talking to you! Get out! Party’s over! Erik, you're hurting me! Let go of her! What the hell have you done? Get out of here! Out! Out! Come on! Get out! Party's over! Get out of here! Julia! He's burning up with a fever. What are you doing? I'm calling the hospital! We have to cool him down quickly or he'll die! Rebecca come on! Help me get him in! Run and get ice from the freezer! Take it easy! Erik... What is happening!? Erik look at me! Look at me. I was so damn scared. Take it easy. What have you done? What the hell have you done!? Your immune system is attacking the new genes... Your white blood cells were multiplying like crazy. Your immune system is just trying to protect you. But it won't stop until it has destroyed all the modified genes... But it's part of my DNA now... My body is trying to kill me? This can't be happening! We'll find a solution. I promise. Julia. How long do I have? How much time do I have? A few days. Unless we find a way to solve this. You're very lucky that you and Julia have the same blood type. We think giving you new blood cells has slowed down the process. But it's just a temporary solution. You used the serum. Are you also going to...? We don't know yet. The effects seem to be latent. That's why we didn't notice at first. So we don't know... Calm down! Don't touch me! Erik. Please! This is your fault. You know that you have killed us right? Erik... Please come home... What difference does it make!? Huh!? The immune system reacts against things that don't belong in the body. There has to be a way to circumvent it. We can't just give up! Something is wrong. My key card to the lab doesn't work anymore. Maybe we should talk to Bergman... I don't trust him. Maybe someone on the forums... No one can help us. Don't you two understand that? We can't handle this on our own anymore! What do you think would happen... If anyone finds out what's happening inside your cells? Do you think they'd fix you? That you'd get to go on a spa weekend to the alps!? What if they could save me? No one can save you! Do you understand how complex our code is? No. How does it look? You're getting worse quickly. Your white blood cells are multiplying. Your immune system is attacking the new genes. What the hell... Rebecca? Are you okay? Rebecca! Those lying bastards! I don't understand what's wrong with the code. It should work. It's like your body has developed some kind of resistance. How do you feel? We should give you a blood transfusion... There's nothing wrong with the code. I know that it's flawless. The carrier is too weak. It's no match for the immune system. Erik... We need help. We will fix it honey... We'll fix it. Is it working? If you have gotten it to work... It's the largest discovery since penicillin. The cells are aging slower Erik! We have to take this to the lab now. It's way too important to work on in a fucking student apartment. Together... You have nothing to do with this! You have stolen my code. Your code? It's not your code. If you had any idea what you were doing... You would have succeeded long ago! Your immune system is attacking the genes, right? Your organs are shutting down, one by one. That's not a very pleasant way to die, Erik. I would be dead already if we hadn't done this. You need help, and I can help you! We don't need your help. Damn it, Erik! Don't come back here! I'm sorry. I didn't mean to... Why are you doing this? Doing what? You're not sick. You could just leave all of this and run away. Why do you stay? Rebecca, what the hell... You can't save us. Get out of here! I'm not going to leave you. Us or the experiment? You're using Erik as a fucking guinea pig. I didn't have any other choice! I didn't know this would happen. All you care about is a fucking experiment. You took the serum too! Why did you take it? I know how we can bypass the immune system! We need more enzyme. Julia, get what's in the refrigerator. Rebecca, find the gene sequencer. What are we going to do with it? Just trust me. What the fuck are you doing!? Run! Damn it Erik! The immune system attacks foreign genes in our bodies. We need a carrier for the code. Something designed to spread aggressively... Before the immune system reacts. What the hell did you take? If we can reprogram the cell nucleus... Of the H5N1 virus with our gene modification... It will be able to bind to our DNA... Before the immune system has time to react. It's the perfect carrier, Julia! Are you completely fucking insane!? Stop! Stop, God damn it! We have to go! Erik, stop! Fuck! Where the hell is Erik? We have to turn back. I don't think Erik is the one you should be worried about. Damn it. This could be the last time I drive this car. Last time I hear this damn song. Everything I do now could be for the last time. Slow down. When I fall asleep I don't know if I will wake up. Rebecca, slow down! Stop! What the hell are you doing? We could have died! I'm going to die any minute now! It doesn't matter! No one cares anyway. That's not true, Rebecca. That's not true. Rebecca... I don't want to die, Julia! I don't want to die! I care. I care a lot about you. I care... I'm sorry. I'm so sorry! Rebecca! Bergman... We have lost control. I need help! What the hell have you done? How can you be so damn stupid!? Fuck. Robert. Damn it! Fuck! Fuck! Erik... What are you doing? I'm calling the hospital. You're not well. No you're not. I'm not going back there. What's happened? It didn't work. The experiment is fucked. The sample is destroyed. I was so damn close to succeeding. So close to making it stable. I was so close to getting it to work. I was so close to making it stable. Erik... The pH value... It shouldn't be neutral if the sample is destroyed. The samples. It has to be wrong. But if the pH value is correct... Then the other values must be correct too. Oh my God... If this is correct, then... It means that the cells... Don't age at all! With the virus's immunosuppressive properties... We can bind it to the DNA without it getting rejected! But you have to help me draw a blood sample... So we can make a new serum. Erik... We can't do it. Julia... Even if you would survive... We have no idea what this could lead to. Julia this is my only chance! We can't control a virus. Julia this is going to work! If the virus spreads to others... And gives them the same side effects you and Rebecca have... We have to destroy it! Erik! Erik! Erik! Oh my God! Watch out! Out! Get out of here! Take it easy! What are you doing here!? The telomeres... They're not getting shorter anymore. The virus is the perfect carrier. The serum is stable now. Don't you understand the consequences this could have!? The cells... Are renewed infinitely! Eternal life! Help! Let me out! Bergman? Bergman! Robert? Robert! Robert... Erik! Erik! Erik! Erik! Erik! Erik! Shit! That maniac is going to kill him! Julia! We have to stop Erik! Erik! Erik, stop! Let go of him! Get away from here! Damn it Erik, you're going to kill him! This is not you! Don't you see what the serum has done to you!? Get away! No! Fuck! Don't do it! I have no other choice, don't you see that!? A mutated virus... With the same side effects, you and Rebecca have... Would be the end of everything. It's not too late. It is for me. Let go! Forgive me. Julia! Julia! What have you done?
