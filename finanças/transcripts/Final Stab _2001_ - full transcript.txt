Hello? Hiya, Charlie. It's me. Hi, Angela. I was just thinking about you. What's that going on in the background? Green zombie, true classic. Yuck, sounds like a great way to spend an evening alone. Well, why don't you come over then? I might be motivated to watch something else. Well, sweetheart, if I come over and all we end up doing is watching TV, I'll be very disappointed. Fair enough. Let me just hop in the shower. If you show up and I won't answer the door just use your keys and let yourself in. You're taking a shower? Why don't you save that for me? What's that supposed to mean? It means, every had a come back? Wow, this is a different side to you. You'd be surprised what I'd do with the proper motivation, sweetheart. See you in a few. Angela? I must have blown a fuse or something. Angela? If you're messing with me... Angela? If you're trying to screw with me you're going to be very disappointed. What the hell's going on right now? Honey? I mean it, this isn't funny. - Boo. - Jesus Christ. Scared you, huh? See? I brought the beer. Very funny. What's up with the lights? Oh, the freaking power company. Oh, guess we'll have to do everything by candlelight, huh? Let me finish my shower first. Okay, I'll just put these beers away in the fridge then I'll join you. Hello? Hey Angela, you naked yet? Angela? What the hell? Jesus, Charlie, another one? Oh, baby. They're getting worse. Maybe you should talk to the psychiatrist again. Maybe they can give you pills or something. No more doctors, I'm fine. Besides, I'm not rich like you. I don't have money running into a shrink every time something bad happens. I'm sorry. You can't keep going on like this. I mean, you have these nightmares, you don't even know why. They're just nightmares. I'm sure I'll live. Could be that half a pizza you scarfed down before bed. Could be my crazy girlfriend. Oh, play nice. Come back to bed. I'll protect you from the nightmares, okay? You need some goddamn sleep, mister. Okay. All right. And if you wake up screaming again, I can just smother you with my pillow. Ha ha. I hope this isn't gonna take too long. You're so impatient, Doug. I think that's what I like about you. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Why don't we just cut the bullshit? Let's get down to business here. Well, this is the future site of one of my more elaborate business ventures. We're actually gonna open it up tonight. What are you talking about? Oh you know, I've been telling you about it for months. Oh, right, that elaborate business venture of yours. The one that's legal for a change. Well, I got to tell you something, Kristin, I'm real proud of you. You're all grown up. What the hell is this place? Ride up with me. I'll give you the nickel tour. Tada. This is, or was, before the bank finally closed on it, the infamous palermo estate. Never heard of it? Sorry, local history really wasn't my thing. It should be. See, back in '95 there was a family living here and one night somebody or several somebodies snuck in, broke the lock and ah, choo, hacks him into hamburger helper. Four people, all dead. Very Charles manson. Sort of. They never caught the guys who did it. This place is a big legend around here. The locals almost burned it down twice in the last five years. They think it's cursed. Or haunted. So you, naturally, went and bought the place? Sure, a girl's got to have her hobbies. Right. Okay, so uh, why am I here? Well, I'm planning on throwing a party out here tonight. For Angela. Okay, second time. Why am I here? Well, I need you to talk to her for me. It's been a long time since she and I have gotten along. If I ask her, she won't come. Yeah, well, she is wise beyond her years. You're her best friend, Doug. This isn't going to work unless Angela's here, you know that. Look, I just think you should just drop it, okay? I mean, really. No, I got Julie and Patrick here setting things up. Brett and Steve are on their way. I've got it all planned out. What? What, you got the whole gang down here? What, what is this gonna be? The Ivy league losers party? Besides, I don't even think Angela likes those guys. Everybody will be okay once I bury the hatchet. Look, I'm not gonna be the go-between between you and your sister, okay? So why don't you just grow up, pick up the damn phone, and do it yourself. Oh, I hate it when we're not love. Okay, that's, you know. I've got the right equipment, keep it. Wrong game. Besides, I'm sure you tell it to all the boys. Like? Oh, Brett. Brett is a marriage of convenience. We conveniently fuck, he conveniently leaves, and I move on to conveniently fuck someone else. Look, come to think of it, maybe that is love. Okay, how about Charlie? Don't even joke about that. Look, if you don't want to cooperate how about I take a drive down to the country club and tell all your friends are a little secret? Or your parents? Thank you. I'm gonna be off for awhile doing some errands but Julie and Brett are here setting things up. I want Charlie and Angela out here this evening, 8:00 o'clock, okay? Things should be set up by then. Okay, what happens after that? Hey, do yourself a favor, don't fret about it. Oh, Doug, give me a big smile, huh? Give me a big smile. I don't get what the big deal is about this flyer. I don't know. It's all those rich kids up at the hardware store buying all kinds of weird shit. One of them dropped that. It's a flyer looking for local actors, drama students, that kind of stuff, yeah? So why the hell should we care? Because that bitch Kristin Mitchell's behind all this. Her name's on the flyer. You mean that preppy chick? Oh man. Oh, yeah. That's that tease that got you all worked up at that donatello mega kegger and ditched you for somebody else, right? Fuck you, Earl. Her folks on the textile plant my old man worked for. He got laid off last year for no reason. Three months before its pension was supposed to kick in. You know, maybe we should just leave it alone. Those assholes are bad news. Well, the way I see it is, if you guys ain't interested in helping me out, it's one hell of a long walk back to town. Helping you with what? And her buddies a little visit. I'm tired of her playing games with people's heads. Especially mine. So when the time comes, I'm gonna mess up their little play or whatever it is. Screw with the car, fuck up the property. Or just scare the living crap out of the snobby assholes. That sounds pretty stupid, man. If you want to pussy out, pussy out. Go ahead and walk back home. Up yours. What happens if we get caught, man? If we do this right, we don't get caught. You got your cell phones, right? Yeah. What I need you to do is go around front and check the gate. I need you to call me when people start showing up. I'monit. You stay with the truck. If somebody sees us, we're gonna need you to haul us out of here. And what about you? I'm gonna sneak around back and whatever you do, don't leave the truck or I'll crack your fucking head open. So why the hell are we doing this, Julie? Because Kristin asked us to, okay? Somehow I don't exactly see Kristin is a party host. Well, this is something she really wants to do. But there's more to it than that. Yeah, it wouldn't have anything to do with that meatball her sister's dating, would it? Right. Here's a thought. Why don't you just let Kristin's sister do what she wants with whoever she wants to do it with? She's a big girl. She seems happy. I mean, I don't exactly like Charlie either, but you know, there's limits. You guys just need to let it go. It doesn't work like that. And besides, Charlie's not part of our crowd. No, of course he isn't. So why don't we just leave him alone? You don't know the whole story. Oh yeah? Enlighten me. Okay, fine. Charlie used to live with his mom and dad a while back and one night this escaped mental patient, or psycho killer, or some bullshit like that, breaks into the house and hacks at mom and dad with the fire ax. Charlie saw the whole thing. It messed up his head really bad. So bad that he spent six months at shallow falls and two years after that on the thorazine express. How do you know all this? Pillow talk. I slept with my mom's psychoanalyst one night and he mentioned it to impress me. I guess it's some big secret. Not even Angela knows, so let's keep it that way, okay? Un-fuckin'-believable. What? That Kristin would go through all this trouble for those two? No, that you slept with your mom's shrink. Bud? Cosmo? You guys get back here already? Hey, now's not the time to be pulling this Halloween shit. What? Dude, it's Earl. What's the problem? Are you still at the truck? Yeah, but I heard something. What, like footsteps or something? Well, no. It was like a branch breaking or something. I mean, I don't see anything but... For Christ's sakes. It's the woods dumb ass. Animals and shit. Are you gonna call me every single time a goddamn squirrel runs up the tree? Well, I thought it was you guys. Look, don't call me unless you see somebody here's or it's an emergency. And don't gonna anywhere, are we clear on that? Yeah. I hate nature. Yeah? It's cosmo. Look, I got Earl calling me up about some stupid raccoon or something he heard in the woods. What's going on over there? Two guys just drove up in a nice car and pulled up to the house. Are they walking row like they saw somebody? No, they drove up as far as I can tell. I think you're okay. I'm gonna walk up a little further and watch. All right, do me a favor and let me know when that bitch shows up, all right? Sure, but what are you planning on doing? Just call me when she arrives. I'm in charge. Steve, catch. You up for throwing the football around? No can do. Yeah, great. They're playing football. Aw, just a couple of minutes. Shouldn't we be setting up for tonight? Yeah, well, that's tonight. How much prep time do I need to die? That's what you get for being a party animal. How's that? Because only the sweet, innocent virgin and her misunderstood boyfriend live at the end. Ever see Halloween? Friday the 13th? Usually gets an ax in the crotch while he does a handstand. Oh, what? Because I like to party? That's bullshit. Face it, Brett, you're doomed. Yeah, well, if anybody hits me in the crotch or anything I'll kick their ass right to the wall. Better talk to the boss. After all, it might be your lucky day. Hey, real stupid, Earl. Bud said to stay with the truck. Great, now I'm seeing shit. Of course, if I was dating her, I'd probably take a shot to the crotch. Where is Kristin, anyways? Who knows. She told me to pick up the actor in an hour. Fuck, she's hiring actors? Yeah. She really is going too far with it this time. I think it's kind of cool. I know that's you, Earl. Hiding behind trees, creeping me out. It's real cool asshole. Listen, just give me a sec, all right? I wanna see if anybody's here yet. All right? Well, here we are. Yeah. We don't have to do this. Look, I want to do this for you, kiddo, okay? I don't mind. You just look funny, that's all. Sick. Thanks. No, seriously, all right? Are you under the weather or something? No, I'm not under the weather. The nightmares, then? I told you, sweet pea, I'm fine. Don't call me sweet pea. Don't call me sick and we have a deal. I'm serious. You don't have to put on this big tough guy act just to make me happy. Too late. We can leave, you know. Bitch or not, Kristin will understand. Look, I really want you and your sister to get along. I know how important it is both of you. You're the best. This is gonna be just some party right? Um, yeah. We'll stick around for awhile, hang out with the guys. Stay away from the girl cleaning, get bored and go home. So where is everybody? Uh, I don't know. Maybe we were the first ones to show up. I still can't believe you got roped into this. Me either. Hey, listen, this is one of Kristin's more lethal soirees so I'll do my best to make sure you guys don't get the worst of it. - Thanks. - Yeah. Looks like nobody showed up. Somebody's gotta be here, right? The door was unlocked, so. This is about par for the course of Kristin. Surprise! Welcome back to my life, sis. Thank you, Kristin. Really, Doug said you guys were having a party but I had no idea it was for me. Yeah, yeah, I know what you thought. I figured it was time to make peace. I'm just really glad you came. You shit. You could have said something. It's a surprise party, the point is to be surprised so. It's been a while, Angela. We've really missed you. Now we're not gonna have to pull this lame surprise stuff every time we want to see you, are we? Oh, it seems he's not having such a good time. Okay, why don't you see if our Charlie needs a drink? Why? Because I asked and because I used small words, honey. Hey Charlie, what's up? Looks like we both got lucked out to this thing, huh? Those Mitchell women, huh? Yeah, tell me about it. Hey, you need a drink? Sure you do. What's your poison? Beer if you got it. Hey Steve, how about making yourself useful and getting our man here Charlie a brew? Nice knife. Looks like the beer's in the kitchen. Hold on a second, I'll be back. Look, you don't have to go to any trouble for me. Oh, let him. It's a rare treat, believe me. Well, I'm not big on the speeches so before I dig into that cake and gain about a hundred pounds, I just want to say thank you for doing this for me tonight. I'm glad I came out, really. You guys definitely went all out to kick this evening off right. I hope bud light's okay. He's dead. Oh my god. The kitchen's empty. Well, he has to be there. Maybe crawled out the goddamn window. My point is, the kitchen's empty. Where's the phone? We need to call the police. I'monit. The line's dead. Oh, fucking terrific. Charlie. I gotta go get him. One of you should go get help. How? We all arrived by limo. Fine, Doug, take my car no get help. Okay, you can get up now. This fake blood tastes like shit. Definitely want to help with that one. You know, you could have made this a lot easier on all of us if me, Patrick, and Steve just took the scum ball out back and beat the shit out of him. Yes, but that lacks finesse. Finesse and legality. You boys take Charlie out back and beat him up and you're up on assault charges. My way is much cleaner. Funny, I didn't know you liked your filth so clean. Oh, we're talking shop, Brett. Save the sex talk for later. Did you see his face? It's working. I'm the queen bitch of deception. How easily I forget. Now remember, in a few minutes the power goes out, the phones are dead, and nobody has their cell phones with them. No, the phones are dead. Which means that everybody had better turn their goddamn cell phones off. And Angela's car battery has mysteriously died. You made sure the cars are all hidden out back, right? Right. Good. So we're trapped here. Steve is dead, stabbed to death, major panic. Okay, now someone gets the bright idea to go look for either a phone... What? Excuse me, queen, but if there's no phones why the hell are we split up to go look for one? And if this place is deserted, which I think it is, then why would even think about going to look for a phone? Doug darling, you're being an asshole. Okay, you can go look for a phone, a nearby farm house to get help, a fucking tampon, I don't care. Just find a reason to split up into small groups. Now one by one, you guys will get killed. The idea being that everyone is playing along with this scenario except Charlie and Angela. Now you just get stabbed with a phony knife, you lay there, you spit up some stage blood, and that's it. This murder mystery weekend is my best idea yet. Charlie? Angela, I'm sorry. They're gonna try and get ahold of the police. We have to stay with the others, okay? 1 can't go back in there. Charlie, we have to. I can't. The blood, it's... Charlie, I know, I'm scared out of my mind, all right? Not half as much as I am. We should stay together. It's the only way we can be safe. That's not true. Charlie, you need to get yourself together. We need to leave. No. Steve was my friend. I just get up and leave my sister, all my old friends. I have to stay. We have to stay until Doug gets help. I'm not talking to the police. Charlie, Jesus Christ, what's wrong with you? Look, if we're not leaving, I need to be outside of this house somewhere safe, something. You're babbling now. Angela, I love you but I can't do this. What, you're just gonna run off? I can't handle this. Charlie. Look, is the game over or are we gonna have to run around this dump playing scream all night? Oh, my friends, this game has only just begun. This is my business venture. After tonight, we're gonna have the hottest weekend getaway in the city. Yeah, and Charlie will end up in a rug room writing home with crayolas. Hey, kill two birds with one stone. Who's the killer? Oh, everybody meet professional actor Wallace Simon. He's playing the killer. So how was my performance? Well, I didn't think that fake knife is very convincing. What's this? Try this instead. I mean, if this is supposed to be a live-action version of a Friday the 13th movie, then the killer is supposed to be killing people. Just watch when you swing that one around, okay? What about my script? There's no script. You mean I'm supposed to prance around in this ridiculous outfit and stab people? That's it? You want a stuntman. Listen, I have a drama degree from west Covina community college. - Yeah? - Yeah. So does my gardener. Look, I'm paying you 100 bucks an hour so you better start listening to the director. Your job is simple. On cue you jump out from behind the gazebo and you attack Julie and Patrick when I say. Got it? It's not Shakespeare. Now you two go on to the courtyard where Charlie and Angela aren't gonna see you and get all dolled up. Remember the blood pump that I showed you earlier? Use that. I think there's a slashed throat too that we can use. We're supposed to go out by the gazebo and get killed? Not quite. Brett and Doug, when Angela and Charlie show up you two take them into the study, you know, stay together, safety in numbers, who knows where the killer might be. Blah, blah, blah, blah, and you wait for my signal. You guys better get going. So, um, what's the signal that we're waiting for? I's just like the horror movies. The power will suddenly go out. Now bear in mind now that Julie's gone, Patrick's gone, and I'm gone. Where are you gonna be? I'm gonna be out by the gazebo directing traffic. But the story is we all went looking for Angela and Charlie. Now when the power goes out, you guys are too freaked to stay in the house, so you take them out to the gazebo. They'll see Julie and Patrick get whacked. It should be enough. Just make sure Charlie's there to see it. You wait out by the gazebo. I'll be out there in a minute to tell you when to pop out and do thing. Okay. Everybody else clear on what we have to do? Steve, you just lay there play dead. Don't get up or I'll really kill you. Brett and Doug, when Angela and Charlie show up just play along like I said. Yes, your fucking highness. Why do we hang out with her again? Because she's usually the one with the coke and the ecstasy. Oh yeah. Damn, I gotta take a leak. Hello? Is someone in here? I saw you. No lights, of course, no lights. I've seen bus stations more sanitary than this place. Fyi, I didn't agree to get those pranks pulled on me. I'm just here to act. Shit! Yep, we're all having fun. I've seen snuff treat their actors better than this. I hate this job. Nice try. The blood doesn't even look real. Who are you, my understudy? Man, am I really gonna have to do this all night? This sucks. Shut up and play along, Steve. Somebody's coming. Doug, what the hell are you doing here? I thought you were gonna go get help. I was but I tried to start your car and the the battery's dead. - What? - Yeah. This is totally fucked up. What are we gonna do, Doug? We? What we? I mean, I know what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna haul ass out of here. What about Steve? We're not just gonna leave him like this. I don't know. Maybe we can come back and carry him, where did everybody else go? They went to find a phone to call the police. Oh, Jesus. Did they at least stay together with that killer out there? Hello? Look, I told you, I don't know when I'm gonna be done with it. Just quit fucking calling me. Uh, look, now is not a good time, let me call you back in a few. What the hell is going on around here? What is this? Some kind of a sick joke? Not exactly. Look, Kristin enlisted you and Charlie to be the Guinea pigs for tonight. She's got this scheme she's been trying to get lifted for years. This murder mystery weekend, just the cool people. A bunch of kids trapped in an old house with a mass killer. It's really stupid. Oh yeah, it's mega stupid. I thought Steve really got killed, so did Charlie. I should have known you guys wouldn't have just thrown me a party 'cause you were sweethearts. When were you let us in on the plan? Look, we didn't mean no harm. I mean, you know how Kristin is, she's always scheming. You remember what she was like in college. Yeah, yeah, she's a total drama queen. What are you guys bitching about? I'm the one who has to lay on the floor all night. This was supposed to be the test run for her murder mystery weekend. You guys are all supposed to go first. Yeah. She thinks she can make a fortune out of this if it works out. Yeah, you know, another fortune. Where is she? 1 don't know but I should probably go find her. See if she needs some help. Is everybody else gonna split up now, too? Well, you and I are actually supposed to wait in the study. Well, I'm sorry, I can't do that. Charlie took off. That thing was Steve really freaked him out. Well, we are 20 miles from town, I don't think he's gonna get too far. Well, I don't want him going anywhere, he's really shaken up. I'm sure if we wait in this study he'll come back and we can explain the whole thing to him. Do you want to go outside and get lost? Because I don't, okay? Trust me. Just wait in this study with me and Kristin's probably found him by now or Brett will. Okay, but if he's not back in 10 minutes we go looking for him. What about me? Can I can go wait in the study too? Look, you just lie down and act dead, okay? We don't want to piss Kristin off. Oh, man. Here kitty-kitty. Here super bitch. Where the fuck are you, Kristin? Man, if you left the truck I'm gonna kick your ass. Great, where the hell is everybody? Earl? Cosmo? Damn it. What the hell is this shit? So are you mad at me because of this? I just don't understand why you have to jump every time she says to, that's all. It's complicated. Take a cue from me. I do my own thing, Kristin does hers. So I guess you don't mind that she's up there right now with Mr. 501 blues? You of all people should know I'm not the jealous type. Well, I guess that was maybe just when you and I were going out. Things change I guess. 1 guess I have lousy luck with guys, huh? I know what you mean. You all need to leave Charlie alone. It's not like I'm picking on Charlie. Alls I'm saying is that our Kristin here probably has an agenda. And what is her agenda? Well, you cut right to the chase, don't you? I'm just saying that I'm sure Kristin thinks it's funny to watch you squirm, okay. I mean you know how she is. She she brings out the worst in people. And what about Charlie? You're all gonna treat him like a leper because he doesn't have your money? Look, don't you lump me in with those guys, okay. I like you and I like Charlie. Then why did you play along with this game of Kristin's? Look, nevermind why Kristin's doing this, okay. I had my own ulterior motives. Oh for Christ's sake. Shit's making my clothes itch my freaking back. Kristin? Somebody? Goddamn it. Wallace, back so soon? Could you me a favor and find Kristin? Tell her Charlie's gone. I don't think he's coming back and I'm not laying here in blood anymore. Did you hear what I said? Jesus. Doug, when did you get interested in me again? In you? I was talking about Charlie. Ah ha, very funny. Okay, seriously, what's wrong? He's having nightmares. It's messing up his job, it's messing up his, oh. Oh. You know, huh? So you guys haven't been doing the nasty? Yeah. Ooh, poor baby. Well have you thought about taking him to a psychologist? No, we tried that. They've tried meds to even him out, nothing works. Maybe Charlie can't be fixed. What's supposed to happen if the gazebo, do you know? Who knows what's going through Kristin's mind but all I know is she's probably having the time of her life. I think we should go after Charlie. Look, Charlie will be fine. Hey, everybody's outside and if he's out there too, I'm sure they probably found him by now and even what I meant on the joke. You didn't see his face, Doug, he was terrified. I know but he'll calm down and you just need to relax. Oh god, I cannot believe we're gonna have to wear this stuff. Eh, come on, it'll be fun. Does it wash it off? Sure, I'll even be the guy who scrubs you down afterwards. Ooh, I can't wait for that part. Do you think Kristin's gonna bitch at us if she sees us messing around out here? We're all alone, okay? What about that Wallace guy? Trust me, nobody's gonna come out here. Boo! Oh my god. Nice going, Brett. What? I thought you're supposed to be inside with Doug and Angela waiting for the power to go out? Yeah and I thought you guys were supposed to be getting ready to get killed out by the gazebo, so. We are getting ready. Yeah, sure looked like it. I went to find Kristin to see if she needed any help setting up. Did you guys see her? Check out the gazebo. We'll be out there in a few minutes. Jesus, can this get any more complicated? Nevermind all that. What the hell happened to the lights? That's that's our cue, okay. It looks like Kristin's got our little party in high gear here so it's off to the gazebo. - Doug? - Yes? You don't really think Kristin out there after Charlie do you? Who knows what Kristin's after? You'd probably know better than I would. What about Charlie? I don't know. What about Charlie? You think he's with Kristin right now? 1 don't know Charlie well enough to make that judgment call but I will say one thing, she has tried before. What? Yeah, it was a while ago just after you two started dating. She made a play for him at some party, she was drunk off her ass, okay. But she practically did a striptease for him in front of everybody. And? And he said no. But you know how Kristin is. Never say no to her, so the next night she showed up at his place in a mink coat and nothing else. Bitch. Don't worry, he threw her out. Which explains a lot. Except for the fact that he never told you. There's a lot of things Charlie hasn't told me. Like about what happened to his parents. Maybe he will in time. Maybe. That looks pretty bad, Steve. Well, I give this to him. He's sure doing a hell of an acting job. Are you gonna do this all night? Hmm, fine. My sister, one-in-a-million. Only Kristin could get a bunch of Ivy league grads to lay down and play dead. Next thing you know she'll be having him play fetch. She does have that way with men. Who is that? Oh, it's that drama student Kristin hired. Yeah, well he's supposed to be out at the gazebo. Let's go tell him to follow us. Hey, Wallace, we'd better hightail it out to the gazebo. Mattress checks out. Terrific. Maybe the poor bastard's having a love affair with the plastic skeleton. Yeah, maybe he really is a psycho. Yeah. Great, the power's out. That means we missed our cue. It looks like the guy snuck out of the bathroom window. Are you serious? Yeah, he probably headed up to the gazebo. We should probably get out there. Who cares, Patrick? I don't. Look, we can lock the doors. We can lock the windows. Nobody gets in and we can do whatever the hell we want to. Right? Shouldn't we tell Kristin? Sure. I mean like right now? Before Doug gets Charlie and Angela out by the gazebo and nothing's happening? You're wrecking the mood. Since you're still dressed just run about there and tell her we need a 15-minute break, please. You want me to go all the way out there? Don't shave your cell phone? Can't you just call her? It's around here somewhere, hold on. Forget it. Look, I'll go. Don't move and don't put any more clothes back on. Brett? Kristin? My turn? What the hell. Is this gonna be bloody cuz it's a real shame to ruin this dress. Found it. Damn, look at her go. That looks great. That's a lot of frigging blood, man. We're gonna take a frigging shower. I guess we're off the hook. It's pretty freaky, Julie. I guess Kristin changed the plot, huh? I'm gonna call her and see if it's okay if I just splash some blood on myself and call it a day. Julie. I can't believe this. Where the hell is everybody? I don't know but I think at least Steve got the right idea, just play dead and stay the hell out of it for the rest of the night. So they were supposed to meet us out here, right? I know Patrick and Julie were. And Kristin? That I don't know. So one of us get stabbed with a fake knife? I can't tell you everything now can I? Damn it. Sorry, I've been doing that all night. Why the hell aren't you over there with Doug and Angela? I went to find you to see if you needed help setting up. Why don't you help me by staying with Doug and Angela? Excuse me for caring. Where's Charlie? Who cares? We're alone and we got all night together. Yeah, you want me, okay. You gonna answer my question, or what? 1 don't know, Angela said Charlie bugged out and ran off somewhere. That's not good is it? I need to know exactly where he is. Why, what you deal with him? I don't get it. Nevermind, all that you need to know is he screwed me over awhile back and I'm getting even tonight. We have another problem. No Patrick, no Julie, and no killer. I thought they'd be here by now. I'll go get them. You go find Charlie. And where is Wallace? If you see him could you tell him to stop fucking around on my time and do his job? No problem. I don't think anybody's gonna show up. Oh, it's Charlie. He's running back inside. Anybody in here? Hey, it's Wallace, right? Look, Kristin's really pissed off. You were supposed to be at the gazebo. Hey, did you hear me, man? You want to take that fucking mask off, or what? I'm not playing games, man. I think Steve must have fallen asleep. Find him, where's Charlie? I don't know. Bullshit. That sounded like it came from the basement. Basement? Charlie? Well at least we know Wallace was down here. Are you sure? Pretty sure. Jesus Christ, why didn't you answer me? I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you. Charlie, thank god you're okay. Steve's not really dead. This whole thing is Kristin's sick little business venture. Fake knives and kool-aid blood. It doesn't matter, it just all came flooding back. The nightmares? Listen, I think it's it's about time we went over a few things. What are you talking about? This whole murder mystery thing is one giant setup. Kristin knows about Charlie's mom and dad. My parents were killed a few years ago. Murdered. I was the eyewitness. I've spent years in therapy. I almost killed myself twice. I thought I was over it but I saw Steve... You should have told me. Jesus, Charlie. You should have told me. So what was the master plan? Humiliate Charlie, make him crazy? Tell me, goddamn it. She wanted Charlie to flip out and distance you two, okay. She she doesn't want Charlie in your life. Okay, that's what she said at any rate. What I think is that she really wanted revenge. She figured that you wouldn't want him anymore if he's in the loony bin. You wouldn't happen to know where she is now, would you? I swear, I don't know. Fine, then I'll go back upstairs and look for her. Doug, is the battery in my car really dead or is that just part of the gag? Part of the gag, of course. Great, I want you to take my car and drive Charlie home. You still have the keys? Yeah. Are you gonna be okay? So wait, I take Charlie home, then what? Then everybody is going to be asked to leave. Everybody except Kristin. I want to be alone with my sister for a while. Why? 'Cause goody two-shoes Angela might be knocking her fucking teeth out, that's why. Hey man, listen. I am really sorry about this whole thing, okay. But if it's any consolation I don't think Kristin is gonna be messing with anybody much after this. It's all right, man. Don't worry about it. I'm fine. So, where to? I say we go get shit-faced. I think I've messed with my mind more than enough for one evening. Oh, come on. Jose cuervos, loosen you up, calm you down. Hey, remember college? Freshman year? Did you ever tell Angela about us? Did you? How open-minded is she? Well, it's not as if I was exactly pushing the envelope when her and I were dating. Now it's just you and me why don't you tell me what the hell you're doing in the middle of all this? Charlie, listen, I had no choice, okay. Kristin knows about you and I. Yeah, and she was gonna tell my parents, okay. I mean, they would disinherit me. How the hell does Kristin know? Oh man, she knows every skeleton in everyone's closet. Every skeleton? Every skeleton. Jesus Christ. What if Angela finds out? I need a drink. Hey now that sounds like the Charlie I know and love. What about Angela? Well, who's to say Angela can't come along for the ride? I can't. I should go get her before she and Kristin get into something ugly. Kristin, your little game is over. I know what's going on. Come on out, bitch. I'm ready to play in your way. Terrific. Now what? Excuse me. Patrick. Patrick. Come on Patrick, you're always good for a drink. You can stop playing for a minute and tell me where the hell Kristin is. Patrick, go ahead and answer your phone. I know this whole thing is your stupid fucking murder mystery weekend or whatever. Who is this? Help. Please. Doug? Is that you? What the hell's going on? Charlie, Charlie, there's somebody out there. Somebody's really killing people. What? I saw Patrick, Julie, and Brett, they're all dead. What have you done, Kristin? I just wanted Charlie gone, okay? I didn't know. I had no idea. Everybody's dead. I know. I didn't think that he would do this. I just thought that he'd freak out and you'd hate him and he'd be gone. He almost got me, got you. I'm so sorry. I'm so goddamn sorry. What the hell are you talking about? Don't come any closer, Charlie, or I'll stab you, I swear to god. Angela get away from him. Look at that, he's got a knife, he's gonna kill us. You know I would never kill anybody. He killed all of our friends. He's psychotic, you know that. - Shut up! - No! Oh, god. I killed her. Perfect. Bravo. Oh that's right, Charlie. Innocent little me sets up a murder mystery weekend to freak out my older sister's boyfriend. Oh yeah, I'm a jealous bitch with money. Only I had no idea would set off your homicidal tendencies. Whoops. How could you do this? You just don't get it, Charlie. I love horror movies, love them. In Friday the 13th, that's great shit. Without getting caught. That's how I came up with this whole murder mystery weekend thing. It's the perfect crime and you're the perfect patsy. Some working-class nut job with a case history. My hands are clean. I'll tell them what really happened. Oh, and who do you think they're gonna believe, psycho boy? But how could you kill them all? No, see. That's where you're confused. You killed them. I brought you out here, you saw some fake murders, you flipped out and went ape shit with a butcher's knife. You get life in jail, Angela gets a tacky funeral, and I get alla mommy and daddy's inheritance money. Like I said, the perfect crime. You bitch. You killed your friends for money? What friends? A pack of losers that kiss my ass to ride on my cocaine train? You're crazy. Whatever. You better stay put. I already called the cops about five minutes ago. The only prints they're gonna find are on the knife that you stabbed my sister with. Wait a minute. That's wrong. That knife looks fake. Where is she? That was a great idea you had about framing me for this shit. It's too bad I had the same idea. No. This is for showing up at Charlie's in nothing but that mink coat you stole from me. How you gonna explain this when the cops show up? It was self-defense. Kristin goes section eight and kills everybody. Gets pissed when things don't go the way she thought they would, comes at you with a knife. You had to protect yourself. The end. Have you ever done this before? It's amazing what you come up with under the right circumstances. You were gone for a long time. Where the hell were you all night? Following your sister, she was really busy. I can't believe she killed everyone, even Doug. He's the only one I actually liked. Me, too. It was so horrible. I heard Doug getting killed on Patrick's cell phone. You know the weird thing is Kristin was at the caretaker's apartment two seconds later to get me. Well, you know your sister, she never does anything halfway. But no human can move that fast. Thank god we stopped her. Poor Kristin. I guess we should have told her the part about how your family used to live here. Well, I didn't want to ruin the surprise. They never did find the guys who killed your parents, did they? No, they never did.
