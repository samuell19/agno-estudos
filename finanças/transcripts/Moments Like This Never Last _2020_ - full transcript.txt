Take it easy. That was my first solo show, it was an honest portrayal of what was going on, you know? I'm a pretty dark person, I thought about ending it a million times. Something that I've learned is art doesn't just happen, it doesn't just appear out of the ether. Individuals have to make it happen. He was the most charismatic artist I'd met since Jean-Michel Basquiat, who also embodied so much of his aesthetic in his person. So he had this kind of situationist idea of psychogeography and he would just wander the city looking for sites to take Polaroids... to tag whatever. We're talking about the 2000s, it was sort of pre-internet. So artists would gather together and just talk to one another rather than communicate over social media or whatever. Put that here. One of the last moments where New York City itself was the sort of studio and the crucible for these ideas and artworks, not the world. And it was conceived of as a completely collaborative work fueled by a certain kind of bravado, a certain kind of art-making, by drugs... ♪ I got my blade, I got my lady Gonna touch my hand ♪ ♪ Give a little kiss ♪ - ...by sex. - ♪ Like this ♪ It felt as if that energy that had been the domain of musicians was being encapsulated in the art world at that moment. - You behaving? - ♪ God have mercy ♪ Behaving like we have a youth code? Dash was such an influential figure in this scene. He really was at the center. This is like typical night out. Dan's doing a bump, Dash is wearing chainmail for no reason. He was so many different things to so many different people that it's really hard to understand him as a complete person 'cause you only got one part of it whereas somebody else might have gotten another part. That's why I think it's interesting to try to do this film to like piece it all together and try to explain honestly your best version of who you believe he is. They loved to take the heads off of my Barbies and throw those out the window. The doormen would come up to our apartment and be like, "Is this yours?" Can I take a picture of the skulls? I can cut it. You got to get in the light though. Is this thing on? I see a red light. When you're 12 and you're out in the middle of the night and you're in a place where nobody else is supposed to be and you got free reign and you see this incredible thing that's huge in the dark in the tunnel, it was amazing. You know when you go to a museum or a gallery and you're like, you can't stop looking at a painting, it was that, turned up. Just because of the environment. It's a fucking addiction you know, it's just in your blood and that's it. You do it all the time and you know, you become a fanatic and he's a fucking beast. This is when I first met Dash. The way I met him was funny. I used to go to this place called the Freedom Tunnels, the Amtrak tunnels. 'Cause it was near my house where I grew up. I went in there one day. I got chased out by some guys with pipes, Share37 and Mars69. Yo, he actually came up to me, told me and Mars, "Yo, what's up?" They didn't rob me with the pipes, obviously, they bought me a forty and we hung out, you know? Sace, myself. I had been doing it for about a year and half and they kind of schooled me a little bit, gave me some letters, whatever, and at first, I was doing what they were giving me and I was like, "Fuck this, I wanna do what I want to do." So it was Sace, then I added an R, as a desperate attempt to try to make it at least a little bit more interesting because it was just like the stupidest name, Sace. I just did that one the other night. I like it because there's no rooftops on C, so that one kind of sticks out, you know? I'd like to say I climbed, but I know someone who lives in the building. My dad used to live down here because I grew up in Midtown, but I remember coming down here I guess like mid, late 80s. That's pretty out of hand. You hard motherfucker, you ain't seen it yet. Manhattan, New York City was not like it is now, where like Downtown is fucking Beverly Hills, like it wasn't a crazy barrier, that you had to be a bazillionaire to live anywhere. You know? It was more of just, a neighborhood. And we were kids, you skate, you write, you hang out, you want to be a bad kid, you want to be cool and we just thought we were ill. I always had a psychotic, like unhealthy amount of freedom as a young person. What's the other name? That's my partner in crime, Glace. G-L-A-C-E, Glace, no meaning whatsoever, I just liked messing around with the letters. When did you meet Dash? I was walking through Central Park, bump into like 25 other people who I had problems with. I told them that I'd fight any two of them, they're like, "Okay, who do you want to fight?" I said I would fight this kid Louie and then Dash. They wouldn't let me fight Dash, Louie slammed my head into a brick wall. - Officers. - Po-po. Coming through, folks. Thank you, coming through, please. The police came, we shook hands. We ended up hanging out, throwing watermelons at cars, smoking weed, causing trouble and from that day forward, we were just pals. Thinking back on my own history and then having a son now, I don't know, it's kind of a daunting thing. I had no boundaries, no rules, no nothing. I was living in this house where there was like these big drug dealers, like in the projects, in the South Bronx, for three weeks. And my one memory of this was like doing coke with these 30-something-year-old men and I'm like 14 and I really looked up to these guys, like old-school graffiti guys, you know, and like four or five little Puerto Rican kids and Black kids running all around while we're doing coke and I think one of them had like his mistress kind of situation in the house with the kids and the mother of the kids came and freaked out and was like, "Who's this fucking white boy in our house, you're giving him cocaine, he's a teenager, we're gonna get arrested," and he had to make me leave, he was like, "I'm so sorry," so I stayed in some other projects, you know. Do you like it so far? Yeah, but I don't understand it. My brother is a graffiti artist, but he does the drawing stuff, you know, with the fingers, yeah, like that. Tagging, yeah okay, you could say that, It looks interesting though. But I'm just curious. They told everybody in the neighborhood that I was half Irish and half Puerto Rican to maybe make it okay, like I don't know how I could get away with that. Here, I'll open the building. How you doing? How's it going guys? - You never know. - Yeah, hell no. Thank you. You have to master the art of sneaking out, which I did till I was like 11 or 12. What would you do when you went out when you were 11? Maybe steal beer, I don't know, just go write. I think even at 13, everyone thought they were so fucking cool, but Dash is like, "Yo, I painted a train with this guy who painted trains in the 80s." And you're like, "What the fuck are you talking about?" But then at the same time, we're like, "That's dope." This guy is doing all this shit while we're all just like catching silver marker tags by the pizza shop. He would just be out all night. When it was time to go home, the birds were actually chirping in the morning. And he would just cut school. My mama started questioning things, she's like, "Yo, man, does this kid go to school or something? He told me he was basically, essentially kidnapped in the middle of the night. He didn't know where he was going for a long time, they only revealed it to him when he arrived there. What pops into my mind is bounty hunters, but not exactly, but sort of the same. The process is, escorts were hired, who were big thugs, that would come and pick kids up at their homes at 4 a.m. and bring them, unbeknownst to them, sometimes with chains between their legs or handcuffs. So probably, two people brought Dash unexpectedly to Georgia. That was something that didn't just happen to him, I guess that was a fad. I met Dash at Hidden Lake Academy, just a fucked up place. I would see some kids arrive in these little zip ties, fighting and you know, 'cause it would be like a show, we'd all kind of watch the new kids arriving and you'd be like, "Welcome to hell," you know? The ways they got here were traumatic to them. Then what would happen, they would be strip searched and it was common and kids did sneak in drugs and knives and other stuff. They would sort of like strip you of your identity. Kind of like, if you had long hair, they cut it, whether it was a band T-shirt, or a pair of sneakers that you skateboarded in, they didn't want you to have any sort of individual expression. We were like caged animals. There was one guy and he was in there for raping his mother and I remember one night over 50 kids went into his room while he was sleeping and beat the living shit out of him. There was a lot of kids that would cut themselves and try to run away. He told me that the girls would cut themselves and drink each other's blood. He told me they had him do arbitrary work, like dig fucking ditches and fill them back up again. Like clearing bushes, digging trenches, moving railroad ties, these massive blocks, kind of to put on the sides of the roads, like war camp style, building the facility for the next group of kids, carrying pitchforks, we were like a little chain gang. You've got to be able to take it. Your body's got to be able to take it. At that point I just wanted to destroy everything. If there was wall in front of me, I wanted to smash it, if there's a person in front of me, I wanted to smash it, I was so angry at everything. I didn't want to be anything, I just wanted to escape, you know, Counts of Monte Cristo. I had a completely different mindset, just like... being abused and locked up and every night before you go to bed they make you take all your clothes off, pick your balls up, bend over, spread your ass cheeks, open your mouth and the walls of the rooms you stay in are all painted bright yellow or shades of dark... or weird greenish gray, like hospitals, jails and psychiatric institutions. It's all like, the tones of the colors of the walls is to try to control you in another way. This whole fucking bullshit therapeutic trip. Most of the kids there were there mandatory by court, you know, but my mother paid for me to go to this place. Paid. So eventually my father came because I refused to have my mother come in. I love my father, but I stole his wallet, it was my only means of escaping and I escaped, ran away, and took the train back to New York, and I lived in the projects in the South Bronx. I can't think of anything that he really did wrong, but the whole thing of separating all of us and sending us in different directions wasn't new, she had always done that. Even when we were kids, we weren't really allowed to play together. We had to be in separate rooms. Insane. But you know, my grandmother is like 75 years old or something like this and she's super fucking cool. You have to understand, before Dashiell Alexander Whitney Snow was alive, his family, Christophe alone was very dynamic in New York and knew Andy Warhol, dated John Lee Hooker, and would have parties... she lived in a firehouse, I heard. And Mick Jagger would come to her parties and get wasted. She married Robert Thurman, who was actually much younger than her. My grandmother was like 35 and he was 19. He was very involved with the counter culture and very close to Timothy Leary and did a lot of experimentation with that kind of stuff. Ultimately, he decided to become a monk and he was the first westerner to be ordained a Buddhist monk. We didn't really spend that much time with him, like my mom told us that he was dead. And you live with your grandma? - And my wife. - And your wife. And you got married like two years ago? Like a year and a half ago or something like that. Is she from here? Nuh-uh, she's from an island in the Pacific. No, I'll tell you. The waitress at the restaurant was a graffiti writer. I was completely in love with her, she's a pirate like me and I love her, I will always love her, you know? He was very sweet, always. Very nice. He knew about everything and everybody. We were at this party and Dash was like "I got something to tell you guys you don't know about me," and he broke down the fact that he had descended from the Schlumberger oil fortune, which you know, I went home and looked it up and figured out, "Oh man, this is not only the oil fortune, it's DIA and it's like, it's everything." My great grandmother Dominique moved to Texas during WWII fleeing from the Nazis, because John de Menil, her husband was part of the French resistance, so were some of her brothers and they had been sabotaging the Nazi trains. So they moved to Huston and that's when they started the Menil Collection. You have this family that has so much privilege and yet there wasn't a whole lot of emotional support. They say blood is thicker than water, but sometimes it's not. So I had to find my own family which eventually happened. Yeah. You know when I met Dash, he was homeless and I met him and Kunle because they were constantly at Astor Place. He was sleeping on the subways, and him and Dash were street kids. I knew him right when he ran away, the year I ran away. It is amazing that we found each other, I needed to get away from my family, he needed to get away from his family. Big up my homie. And we have all this energy and we need to sort of be around like-minded people. Being gay in the suburbs was always really tough and I felt really misunderstood and I just felt like I needed to find people that were like me and that were interested in the same things that I was interested in. Being from New Jersey where there's only one or two kids in each town that skated, you would link up and go to New York and you would kind of all skate from the banks to the sea port, to Midtown, skate all over the city. Once you start coming to New York, it sort of becomes an addiction. A lot of these kids in New Jersey would be like, "I can't believe you go to New York and skate all day and you get chased and you go to raves." And I would look at them and say, "I can't believe you don't." It was right there, it's so easy. And you felt part of a bigger thing than you did wherever it was you came from. I think I'm getting addicted to this shit. Visually they were the most exciting kids, and I wanted to make a film about that generation which I knew nothing about. I met Ryan after Kids , I think, then I met Dash through Ryan. I remember crossing the street with Dash and talking to him, laughing with him and I felt like I was a teenager. I'll never forget it. I actually wrote a screenplay and the premise was Dash's crew. Where should I write IRAK? I couldn't get it produced because no one understood it, you know? Silly graffiti writer, just do this. Ready? Track mark, Renegade, what else did we have? Crispy White Kids. We started a crew for a few days, Crispy White Kids, but it was one white guy, a Dominican and a negro. I wasn't down. I can't be down. The crew lasted for one day, man. - It was your crew. - So? I was trying to put you on, like your own little... You don't remember that? When I tried to do that for you? Yeah, IRAK. That's our crew. A few years, a few years. '99 was when that really kicked off. It's Kunle's crew, like he started it. I started stealing shit... and then I met some other graffiti writers that were into stealing shit and were good at it, but not as good as me. Kunle was a booster, he made his money shoplifting, stealing North Faces, like Enfamil powders and selling them to bodega guys and etc, etc. And it's the closest thing to a job that anybody had. You'd be walking down a street with Ear Snot and he didn't like the way he was dressed. So he would go in a store and come out with all different clothes. He would just leave his clothes and take the clothes he wanted. Yeah, I'm just good. Like seriously, everything, cereal, frying pans, scuba suits, steak. Him doing things that were next to magic, like pulling a chair out of his pant leg, like a collapsible chair. They definitely weren't normal graffiti writers that wore graffiti writing clothes. Like they would go out bombing in a $20,000 mink coat, you know what I'm saying? They didn't give a fuck about that stuff. We were a multicultural crew. Kunle being gay. You eat a lot of steak, huh? I eat a lot of meat, if you know what I mean. There was zero maturity. It was like, you know, "That's the person that we make fun of," and they're like, "faggot, faggot." And it's like, "Really, you want to fight or something because you got to stop calling me a faggot," and they're like, "What are you, gay?" And it's like, "Yeah, and?" And they're like... And then we would fight then I'm just like, okay, so... Graffiti is this basically uptight, homophobic, and just uptight tough guys, you know? And here Snot showed up as like a big pro-gay, sex-positive graffiti writer and it just really rejuvenated the whole thing. It made it, it was like fresh ink in the mop. That crew was definitely like what New York City was supposed to be, the ultimate melting pot of new ideas and experiments. That was like right when I met him, I think I ran into him one time at a party and he was with the whole crew, and they were acting so crazy, wearing all this stolen tech gear, writing tags in the hallways. They were all like... After we met, every day and night we painted, and then go to bars after you paint or before, and started just getting introduced to this crazy life that Dash lived. We're on 7th Street, between 1st and A, yes, this is Ryan's building. Yeah. And it was like the kitchen was a mess, iced tea all over the place, like cups and stuff in the sink, it was pretty flop house-y, like a community art studio. It was like the most fucked up episode of Friends or Seinfeld that you've ever seen, where people were just in and out, in and out, all night long. Originally, it was me and Teddy. I knew Ryan from high school. I moved into the city at the end of '97 and then Ryan and I moved together in December of '98 and that's when all these guys started washing up on our doorstep. That was the beginning of it all. 7th Street was our clubhouse. And then it became me, and Teddy and Dan. When I think of 7th street, I really think of like, a bunch of people piled on a bed. And then Dash moved in for a little bit. So it was me and Teddy and Dan and Dash. You'd be on a bed with six people or you'd take a break and be on a bed with one person, all on a very kind of intimate level. So I would go over to 7th street and there'd just be like coke on the table and everybody just ripping and roaring and nobody wants to photograph a bunch of guys smoking weed, you know, that's boring. So let's give Dan Colen some dust and see what happens, this big floppy motherfucker. I was really, out of that crew, the only person with a studio practice. I would come back at the middle of the night, they would all be making stuff all the time, their practice, their work happened amongst people. At the time Dash was married to the artist Agathe Snow. They were the first people to let me into their love affair, it was so cool to have these two people that were so comfortable in front of the camera and I got to photograph their relationship for years. You know, the 7th street crib, that's what that was, people used to be scared to come after hours, like, "You guys do a lot of drugs there." But we were also doing a lot of creating, that was the launchpad of Ryan's career, Dan Colen's career, Dash Snow's career. He brought me to the basement of La Poeme, which was his wife's mother's restaurant and he pulled out from the shadows this box of Polaroids and he just showed me thousands of Polaroids. Dash only shot Polaroids. Yo, Craig, what do you think? This shit is ending, it's always easy for it to turn diagonal and it's totally not straight, - should I just restart? - Yeah. - Yeah? - You need help, man? Want me to hold it and then you could... I guess, I don't know what the fuck... It's gonna be hard to get it exactly like, aligned. And then I have some cool Polaroids of Dash's. I think they're all in this portfolio. Oh this is an unpleasant one, but this is Kent and probably Agathe passed out-ish. Nice composition of bodies. Oh man. Just Kunle tagging a police barricade in a wheelchair. Some of his best photos involve Kunle, I feel like you could say he was a muse. Like I said, Kunle. This is a nice brotherly love photo. You know, a lot of the Polaroids, even though they look like accidental moments are really staged moments and people wanted to be manipulated by him because he was so magnetic and they wanted to spend the evening with him, you know what I mean? So he had this sway, it's like a natural ability to direct humans. There's one absolutely remarkable image, it's somebody snorting coke off of Ear Snot's erect male member. Everybody was in it together. Nobody felt exploited or anything like that, it was like I can't even match what this guy is doing, so what's the big deal if I get naked? This guy is doing coke off of this guy's dick and I'm worried about getting naked? We were like, "Well, all right, photograph my dick." So there was a real freedom within all of that. This is a nice one. This is my friend Ry, he has some panties on his face and he's going through the purse of a lady whose T-shirt says "Jesus loves you." She's sleeping and her purse is being explored. I mean, it's partially just being very young and just reckless and you feel like you could live forever and this and that, but I think also with him it just seemed like he'd really push it. It's those moments when you have all the players and all the characters and all the attitude and all the drugs, and here's the streets, here's your stage and the door opens up and it's like somebody's gonna die tonight. Stories... lighting Christmas trees on fire, and then a car catching fire, he's a little pyromaniac. I remember him throwing cans into a fire once and them exploding. This is what happens when flames meet aerosol cans. Come on, man. - Yeah, okay. - Like imagine being burned... You know, he didn't have any sort of fear of heights. I have a picture of us where he's got one foot on the outside of a building, the whole rest of his body is suspended out, I'm just holding his hand five stories up or something like that. Dash was a very agile and peculiar, special climber, moving in a way that you can't really compare him to anyone else. Really graceful. He had smaller feet than I did, so he would run out on ledges without a care in the world and I was super afraid of him dying or something, or falling, like it made it more worth it for him if he could almost die doing it. It felt like you almost just were like "Fuck it," like every night you went out, it almost felt like you could die. I mean, there's definitely an air of daredevil-ism, I guess, trying to do the most outrageous thing, like paint the busiest place. Oh, the floor. Yeah, some guy did that. I've seen pictures, it's crazy. No, it's cool. I've got a picture of it in my house. I mean, everyone hated Giuliani at that time. CPR, corrupt prejudiced racists. No person in the city, especially if you are of color should have to worry when your children go out so that they may not be able to come back. - No justice! - No peace! - No justice! - No peace! What do you think of Rudy Giuliani? I mean... Stupid. Everybody's going, getting arrested for graffiti, possession. I'm on 6th Avenue and Prince Street, and whatever, and they pull me for no reason, and I had a marker in my pocket, so it's possession of graffiti instrument with intent to do it. So you do a night in central booking, and I have to say, to be honest, I'm not racist at all, but I'm white and it helps. I swear, with every aspect of things. When they started shutting down the parks at dusk, where people could kind of gather at these places, that kind of became the enemy in a weird way of the quality of life moment in New York City. So him and Kunle and the rest of the IRAK kids like slammed New York City, and especially like Dash. He hit the fucking Brooklyn Bridge. That's forget about it, right there. Legalize graffiti. Dude, it won't happen though, this never would happen. That would be like the worst thing ever, oh my God. Because then I'd have to start doing some move... Then we'd have to go to art school. Yeah, right? Yo, Ben, KS. Yeah, I don't know. This guy always wanted to paint the fucking Brooklyn Bridge because that's an insane thing that only one person had ever done before, and it's a landmark, and it's dangerous, disrespectful. It's the fucking Brooklyn Bridge. The cars are underneath you so there's bars that go across to the ledge, and you just run across the bar, and then he jumped up there, painted "Fuck Giuliani," and he probably had to look up how to spell Giuliani's name. Dash just went up there, took off all his clothes, facing the water, he's like "Yeah!" Whatever, it would've been so nice to jump off into the water if you wouldn't die, you know? We went to party after that, we went to Cherry Tavern or something and stayed up all night. We were telling people to look at it, joggers, and they're just like, "Leave me alone. What are you talking about?" Because we thought it was so cool. Shit, I don't know how I would feel now, as a 37-year-old man if it's some fucking asshole you know, defacing the bridge and I had no insider knowledge, but at the time, it was pretty glorious, it was a really fucking fantastic, amazing, legendary thing to do. Yeah. Glorious. Plus also, because you know, Giuliani is such a... Yeah, such a fucking dick. - Two planes? - Two planes. Oh, I've never seen anything like this, you'd see movies, but they were movies, but this? Did you know there were people jumping off? That's what I heard. The guy said he saw six of them jump, one after the other. Come on. What are you gonna do? Michael! Go east, I'm not going in this building, go east, go right. Go to the river. Everything is falling down. They all went this way. My generation, the formative experience, the shock that changed our worldview was the Kennedy assassination, and for people Dash's age who were in New York City during 9/11, that was cataclysmic. Downtown was basically a war zone and from Houston street downward, it was just blocked off, it was toxic, and this cloud remained for weeks and every sensitive person was affected. A lot of people saw the Twin Towers, not just saw on TV, like saw it, and maybe even found themselves running from it if you lived on lower Manhattan. And of course that had a very profound impact on the art of Dash and his friends, the love of detritus, of garbage, of ruins, those things would exist apart from 9/11. But given that fact, they have another connotation as well, something thrilling about an innocent apocalypse would come across in their work. After the towers had fallen, we all went down on our BMX bikes and we wanted to see what was going on and just see what we could do. Everything sort of felt like this photograph to me. Actually, I was in jail overnight. But I remember being in bookings and the towers having gone down, and the CO's coming and being like, "The country's at war. You're all in here indefinitely." I remember coming out and it felt different, it felt like you had descended into the catacombs. I have no idea if that moment in time marked something for our personal psychologies or you know, us as a group, but we always lived in sort of a space that felt disastrous. Like we were living at the end of the world. The paper, I think both of us were shocked by how paper survived. We were totally abandoned there for a while, but what happened was the eye of the world came there. And New York starts changing after that, there's American flags everywhere and then it becomes America. 20 blocks below 14th street, that nobody wanted to be into, two years after 9/11 and it becomes the one place that everyone wants to be at. ♪ Through the perilous fight ♪ ♪ O'er the ramparts we watched Were so gallantly streaming ♪ The world is coming to an end one day and we all got to stay strong because this is God sending a message to the world, now we got to stick together and help one another, ain't that funny? My name's Steve, yo. Around 9/11, we were all together and in that bubble, when the outside world was just crumbling, all we could do is party anyways, and create this amazing family and I felt it was so much like the Great Depression but it was kind of a moral depression, my security was these people. Like 365 people came that day, it's a lot of people and at the same time, I'm just like, every single one of these people has a reason to keep moving. I mean that's the thing, what keeps you moving, you know, what moves you? Things that last, like what lasts, of everything? It's that community, there's nothing more powerful than community. Where are you guys walking? I'm walking to Alife. I'm walking to West Broadway and Canal. I was taking pictures for a long time before I show anybody, you know, like taking a lot of Polaroids, I have boxes and boxes in my house. 'Cause at the time it was like illegal life, you know, like stealing drugs for money, all this shit, you know, like not making any sort of legitimate funds or anything not living very good either. And a lot of people were saying "You should show these pictures." "You could sell them," blah, blah, blah. But for me it really felt like an impure gesture to submit this to the world. Like, this is not for anyone. This is for us. And it's too pure of a moment. It's hard to proclaim yourself, you know, something when you don't necessarily understand who you are. Graffiti only touches upon art in a way. And it's sort of a dirty intersection but there was an Avenue C apartment at some point in time. And that place was like the inside of his mind turned out. And you may have even been there at some point in time. It was a little apartment. It had, I remember these like little arched entryways. The things that were on his wall were predictive of what his work would actually become. I mean, you've seen Dan's recreation. That's where I started being like, "You know all this shit is like art, right?" I mean, things would assemble, you know, like literally sculptures would come together and I was like, well... I just don't know what else to fucking call like a birdhouse that you dragged into your house that you collected crab claws and put them... arranged them around the birdhouse as swastikas. It's just like, that's a sculpture. I was going to call that "The Heartbreak Hotel" and then I was going to call it "The Sugar Shack". And then I settled for a pretty crazy name, but it's called "I Can't Even Imagine The Moment The White Men Land And They Fall Into Nothingness." It's interesting, I think, like I said, in collecting all of this ephemera and items, you know, that it helped him to define himself more so, you know, or create a persona that he felt more comfortable with or more at home with than you know, SACE, you know, graffiti writing Dash. It's like 50 bucks. I was like, "40." He's like, "Deal." He's like, he's like, "You're making a movie?" "Is that a prop?" I was like, "Hell yeah." Did you walk down 6th Avenue with that like on your shoulder? He gave me a garbage bag and I did walk down 6th avenue. Dash's first show was at Rivington Arms and they gave him the space and he filled it up. He put the disgusting couch in it. These are all Dash Snow's things? Yes. This leather, just like the grossest, like middle America dad couch, or like something that was easily cleanable with like a rag of some sort. And there was this guy named Papa Smurf who was always around the Lower East Side. You should get a job making people nervous. Hey Cheryl, this is Papa Smurf. My man. - Papa Smurf. - Hi, how are you? Cheryl. And he invited Papa Smurf to the opening to sit on the couch. I think the gallerists were like appalled. ♪ It might be our last chance ♪ But that was like, all my photos since I was 16 years old, narrowed it down to that. ♪ It might be too late For me to say goodbye ♪ ♪ And it may be too late to watch this sick old city die ♪ ♪ Going on the road ♪ ♪ Yeah, I'm going to try to say ♪ ♪ Sick city so long Goodbye and die ♪ I always thought that these zines were actually the most complete expression of his work in a way, that it was most suited to book format which is strange because a lot of his time was spent pulling things out of books effectively or out of magazines and out of the papers. He would always make a copy and he'd find me and bring it to me. "My Mind Has Finally Accepted That It's Right". Volume one. And I can't remember what sequence these came in. I think the imperative of art is, well, John Baldessari would say it's not to be boring but it is to change our view of the world. And you're not going to do that without troubling people. I think for those like Dan and Nate and Ryan who had formal training, I think that the punk aspect of what Dash brought to the table in that he, he didn't have any of that background. And he didn't know what he was doing or maintained that he didn't know what he doing. He maintained that he didn't give a fuck either. So that was a good sort of chemistry for those other guys who'd literally just come out of school essentially, and were steeped in all this sort of art historical knowledge and practice and all the rest of it. And there was Dash saying, "Fuck it, you don't have to do that." "You can be an artist and roam the streets." That was what I think we don't have now. There was a very sort of feral way of roving in packs, and discovering things and discovering the city and finding new ways to cause trouble. Are you nervous? Not nervous, but we are going to get a lot of people. Art is generally collected by people who have followed the rules, and they have relatively conventional lives. But a number of them really wish that they could be like Jean-Michel Basquiat or Dash, that they could let it all go, that they could drink themselves into a stupor. They could get high. So collectors do like the idea of collecting the work of misbehaving, bad boy artists. I just got here. - Really? - An hour ago. You've had a long journey. Me and Dash traveled, like the world together. Strangely, there's weird pressures put on by the art world to be crazy, to live outrageously, to do a lot of drugs. In somebody like Dash's case, you would show up in fucking Tokyo and there'd be cocaine waiting for you. And you thought, "Well hey, I thought this was like really hard to get here and like super illegal." And they'd be like, "I know." They would be so into it. You know, like, "We're going to get crazy." And also these galleries would fly out your whole entourage just to make it more exciting. What up, dude? What's going on? I'm just running into Nate right now. But that's who you ended up hanging out with. You'd never really, you didn't go to these art dinners and spread out. You still just stayed in your little circle and talk shit about this art dinner, "Hey, who has drugs?" And that kind of a thing. You know, that shit's fun for a night or two, but eventually you just feel like you're being put on stage and playing a part. The bad boy thing is a disruptive thing, blaming them for that behavior and that attitude is a little bit unfair. If the fact that they happened to be all white and predominantly male is something that wasn't their responsibility, but it was probably the people like me and curators who supported them. I think we take responsibility for that. You know, I remember that New Yorker magazine or New York magazine where they were trying to follow around Ryan, Dash and Dan. And Dash hated that shit. And he was avoiding it like the plague, but of course in avoiding these things they get to write whatever they want. So, he was kind of screwed either way, and they wrote whatever they wanted. And Dash hated the article. He didn't live for the limelight, that's for sure. Was it fun to be on the cover of New York magazine with Ryan and Dan in bed? Maybe in a way, it's a cool cover. And the story was horrible. It created a distorted story of this scion of a wealthy family who was slumming in the art scene. Suddenly he's propelled to the front of the pack in the art world. You know, suddenly getting all the accolades, show at the Whitney, the auction results. His collaborators are suddenly right there with him. You know, his mother is someone, his grandmother is someone. So what? You know, I think Manet was, his mother was the goddaughter of the King of Sweden. Do you not like Manet? He was a rich kid, too. All these people who didn't know him have invented some false image of sort of some pretentious trust fund kid who was playing being an artist. It's something about Dash rebelling against his rich art world family by becoming a rich artist, sort of backfired. To be in the press was to also be kind of connected to his lineage. And I think it was painful. This was kind of the beginning of the crew being brought into the forefront. Now this photo is in, what is it, the Whitney? Permanent collection, right? Yeah. And I'd say, who would've knew? You know, we were just a bunch of fucking animals. And I feel like they've gotten obsessed because, you know, these guys blew to meteoric proportions in a short amount of time. All of a sudden, no one's writing about Dash. They're writing about some phenomenon that Dash represents to them. And it's like, he's like lost in all the writing. I think he thought that that was a great quote. That was a review of his work. Yeah. But I think he saw the humor in it. I was there the day that Dash made the film of all the male hustlers jerking off onto the lightbox They gave the hustlers plenty of drugs, plenty of magazines and DVDs to watch to get ready to jerk off. Dash came to me at some point during the day, he goes, "I don't know what's wrong with these guys." "They're not professionals." "None of them can work under pressure." 'Cause none of the guys could get hard, because they had done too many drugs. But Dash was really upset. Like a director, like, "I'm working with amateurs," I remember him saying. It was great. ♪ Your city's a sucker ♪ ♪ Your city's a sucker ♪ ♪ Your city's a sucker ♪ - One dollar, one dollar. - One dollar. Our military at home and around the world is on high alert status. We will do whatever is necessary to protect America. We will show the world that we will pass this test. God bless you. I think we just had gone into Afghanistan. The first thing that comes back when the country's been demolished is probably the drugs. And I thought, "Okay, I bet in like a year or two it'll be heroin," because that country produces it. And about a year or two later, everyone's doing heroin. I was always an uptown guy like C train all the way, cocaine to the motherfucking brain. But these guys were taking the D downtown and I wasn't a dopey guy. The Lower East Side was, you know. Avenue A was fine. B eh, C eh, D don't go there. Like, we used to go buy drugs on D. We used to buy drugs on C at the bodega. I used to buy cocaine at a pet store on Clinton street. I used to buy weed at a juice bar on St. Mark's. Laundromat, the laundromat on Avenue C sold dope. Everyone hung out here 'cause there was... we just went to the bars around here, you know, and everyone did coke and everyone's just like hanging out and drinking and doing coke. And it was just like so normal and fun. Imagine 15 dudes in a studio apartment just doing coke in August. The party was real, you know, like it didn't stop. It was every night. Every night, I mean, as far as I remember it was every fucking night. I mean, yeah. IRAK's drug of choice was more. That was when the heroin started coming in and then it became like, you know, it got glorified in our crew. Became like how coke was. They were like hanging out with like the heroin bags and the bundles in their mouths and all that shit. And I was just like, "This is terrible." Like, "This is going nowhere good." All the heroin didn't come until they started getting a little buzz to their name. I remember ID doing a story on the IRAK crew and Kenneth shooting it for Mass Appeal , you know, and all these guys. And Kunle being one of the 50 most beautiful people in Paper magazine, like people get gassed. But I also feel like for someone like Dash, who didn't want the fucking attention, he wanted to be like underground always. This shit is crazy. That innocent, free spirit that Ryan captured in his photos was gone. And it went dark. We'd be hanging out at his place on Bowery when it was his studio, and he would like roll his sleeves up and go out. Even though it was totally obvious what was happening. He didn't mind talking about doing drugs. I'm already out of my mother's will. I got nothing. I got no reputation to keep up. You know what I mean? But at the same time, I wasn't really trying to show that. And then I was like, "Look, if I'm going to show everyone else, I got to show myself too," you know what I mean? I'm not, I'm no shiny guy. You know what I mean? I'm not, it's rough. And it's like, a lot of people will see it and... or have seen shit and be like, look at me fully differently afterwards, but I don't... you know, that's what it is. I'm not trying to be someone I'm not, you know. That's what happened and that's how it goes. You know, I'm not scared. Well, I found a lot of kids taken away from it. I turned into a parent, I turned it into a grandpa. I turned into something, you know... disapproving the behavior because I saw, you know so many people dying and stuff. And I was... and I was saying, "Hey, wait a minute," you know, "This is about self-destruction." You know, "This is not heroic." I have to say, I have no regrets in general, but definitely been rough times. You know, I'm not happy. I wasn't happy for a long time being where I was, just... That's why, like, I wanted to make a point to say that I'm not trying to glorify anything. So I worshipped, you know, self-destructive behavior and made a lot of great work out of it and so did Dash. Like Larry's books, I have a few of them, the ones I want are too much money. And like, they only made a few or whatever but I've seen all of them and they're rad and I'm sure he's not stoked on some of those pictures of himself, but he'd, I'm sure at some point he had the thought like, you know what I mean, bite the bullet or whatever, like just do it. You know? And like embarrassment is whatever. I'm not embarrassed about anything I've done, you know? - Even when they were... - They worked, yeah. ...the most fucked up they could be, they were documenting it some way, you know. That's what I did. No matter how fucked up I was, no matter what I did in my life, I always made work out of it. And I guess that's what I was saying about kids worshipping this self-destructive lifestyle. I was the same way when I was a kid. I mean, my heroes were junkies. You know, my heroes, you know, were heroin addicts. You know, they say that nobody wants to grow up to be a junkie. Well, I did. And if you have everything, if you have everything that you want and you can't get clean, then it'll kill you, you know, or you'll kill yourself. It says, "Dear Dave, I can't tell whether I love more you or this record." Where did he send that? He send it to you or brought it to you? Yeah, it came with a pack of heroin. And then when I told him he was like, "Don't do it." He's like, "Don't do it, don't do it." "I didn't mean to." "I keep that in all my favorite records." That's sort of the stash spot, he would keep his stash in his favorite records. You hate L.A.? My dad, he started out as a musician and a really good one, but he got into this drunk driving accident and he crashed into a train and lost most of his fingers on his right hand. So he couldn't play guitar anymore. And that's when he started really spiraling into his addiction. And he was in and out of that during our whole lives. He was this enigmatic addict, artist, musician and I think that definitely had a big influence on Dash. He was his dad. And you always look up to your dad. Oh, and it had electricity and everything. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Being free to Dash was everything. And with addiction he did not feel free. He felt prisoner in those moments. You know when Dash was good, he was so free he made other people feel free. He saw the beauty in everybody and they felt beautiful when they were around him. We met in 2006. Oh, this is a good story. We should have this. Is it recording? - Yes, it is. - Okay. So, I'll tell you the story. No, no, no, no, no. - I'll say the story. - So what's the official story? The official story is, so there's three sides to every story, right? The truth, the man's version and the woman's version. Well, I'll consider the man's version the truth at this point. I don't know how I got there. I don't know what, it was some party. And she was out with, she was going out with another man at the time. Not quite as manly as myself. She was wearing this really foxy black tight dress. And I was just like, like, you know in The Godfather he's walking with his bodyguards and he sees this woman, this great woman. And he goes... and the bodyguards, they say, "He just got hit with a thunderbolt." It's a sort of like this, I was really like... before I did it with her, I jerked off so many times thinking of her, that kind of thing, you know? So, I'd see her and I was just like... and she wasn't into me. She wasn't having it. - And I went up to her. - That's not true. You weren't having it. 'Cause I went up to her and I said... I'm not normally so blunt, but I looked at her and I said "I'm not leaving this party without kissing your mouth." "I'm not leaving here without a kiss." And she wouldn't do it. Well, the guy I was dating was 10 feet away. But I didn't care, you know. I was trying to have some respect. But you wanted to. I did. So, that was kind of that. And then I had to go and I didn't see him again for a long time. And then our friend was doing a party scene for a film she was working on. And when I walked into the room he was sitting right there and I remembered him and I, I never stopped thinking about him. He was so charismatic and good looking and I sat right next to him and I said, "Hey." And he was so happy. He was like, "Oh my God, it's you." And that was it. We just never left each other's side from that day. I'm so in love. I'm so in love with this woman. But I mean, I've never had this before and I've been with a lot of birds and whatever, but it's like really special. I can hear everything. It's everything. Time, time, time, time, time. When I met him, his first big solo show and the show was nine months away. It was actually called The End of Living and the Beginning of Survival. And he was very nervous about it. 250-something pieces. And it was like maybe eight months, but I really sort of lost it and like sort of locked myself away a lot, you know, like in my house and just drink by myself and listen to music really loud. The gallery decided without telling us that they were going to promote the opening night with the flyer that he did for a show, with a suicide hotline on the back. His scary ass mug, yeah. Oh, look at that. And we played the opening. It was like very widely promoted. Like I remember like driving from the airport and there was like posters of his face on the streets and all this shit. I'm sure it freaked him out. When we first arrived that night, there was like a dinner for him. I remember walking into the room and it was like an art dinner thing with a long table of people. And I remember him looking like extremely uncomfortable and like sort of maybe like embarrassed in a way or something, you know. Like, I'm sure these gallery people were great to him. And he got along with them fine, but it was just something that made him uncomfortable about at all. He always wanted to like hide, and I could relate to that. But I was doing some dope and stay up for days and just really like working, working, you know. He had a very particular vision of how he wanted it all to go down. And opening night was packed. A lot of people came through, Tal R, Jonathan Meese, Christopher Wool actually skipped his own opening that night to come to the dinner with Dash. And I was pregnant and he had just come back from Berlin to Paris. I mean, it was really as if we had not a care in the world. He was doing all right. How would you define success? For whoever has success, the person themselves just being content with what they've done over years or over whatever span of time, just like people are excited about what you've done can relate to it. Or I don't know, you touch someone, somehow. Whether it's one or a million or whatever, you know. Dash and Dan and all the central people came down to Miami during the art fair week. But I heard that the night of the opening they had created one of their infamous nests in their motel room, which involves taking every telephone book that they could find from every room and public place and ripping the pages to shreds and creating their own version of a hamster nest and just spend the whole night acting like human hamsters. And I said to Dash, and to Dan, "Could we do this as a gallery show?" Dash of course was all up for it. Then Dan and Dash would arrange for their whole circle of friends to come and get drunk, get high, whatever they were going to do the whole night and cover every surface. There's some people who think we should just leave this open permanently. You know, like the Walter de Maria Earth Room on Wooster Street. We should keep this as the New York Dirt Room. Let me do it. That was semi all good, right? Man, it's hard to launch. I wanted to be very careful with safety 'cause the whole thing was a fire trap. I made Dash promise no smoking. Then the other thing is there's spray cans, 'cause it's really flammable. "Just be super careful." "Please trust me on this." Unbeknownst to Jeffrey, three, four in the morning Dash's friend Jason Dill was there. He was skateboarding and Dash grabbed a spray can and a lighter and made like a beam of fire for Dill to jump over. And I got some nice photos of that. Later when I edited the book, I included that photo in there because it was awesome. And I remember when I presented Jeffrey with the Nest book, when it was finally complete, him like flipping through it and him stopping at the fire ball photo and like pausing being like, "If I acknowledge this I'm going to have to fire Kathy, 'cause she could have like ignited a giant pile of paper in the gallery left unattended in the middle of the night." He debated it. And then I saw him finally just turn the page. Just pretend he hadn't seen it. Keep going like normal. I hadn't thought about it at the time. I was pregnant and he was creating a nest. He gave me this and this is one of the proudest creations of his life, is this little picture of his arm and little Secret, it's his daughter. He became a very interested in documenting his private life, rather than his outside life, his social life. He was with Jade and you know, Secret was born and all of a sudden it's... you know, representative of a life that he's been going away from forever and ever. And then I think it must be made even more complicated by the fact that there's such a deep love between, you know father and their child. I think that he was happy for a while and he loved being a dad, and had gone to rehab and was doing really well. He tried to quit so many times with methadone, doing suboxone, you know, cold turkey, you know, he would try. But I think as soon as his brain would clear out a little bit, he would be tortured, because the real problem would be uncovered maybe. And he couldn't deal with it. Like he never talked about his mom. He'd talk about his dad. It's tricky getting old. But I feel like, strangely, Dash felt like he was losing control over who he was. There was a lot of times when I felt like, "Wow, this seems really dark right now." Like the people around Dash are really not the best. And then he had new artsy friends, that were also heroin friends. There were certainly enablers. Like here's a hotel and here's some drugs. It's really cool to them, 'cause they just discovered it and they're selling it. And they're like trying to make sure that this carries on. Are you still, like, pretty friendly with a lot of the people you grew up with? It was hard to tell what the reason was, why we weren't hanging out as much. But it was just as much me as anything. 'Cause I wasn't tolerating the heroin. Luckily Jade was around. I remember Dan said, "Oh God, he called me from rehab." And he had snuck into some room. And he was underneath a desk with a phone, 'cause you weren't supposed to call anyone. And he'd said to Dan, "They're making me talk about my whole life story." I was living in the studio and this old, old dude who's like a life-long heroin dealer is calling me all day and I'm like, don't call me. Dash isn't here. He doesn't want to talk to you. He's like, "I just wanted to know." "He wants to talk to me, believe me." And, "He wants to talk to me." "He's trying to get in touch with me right now." And he's like, "Just tell him I called." And I'm just like, dude. He would tell us like a lie and be like, "I'm just going to go out to do this." And he would like, meet the dude to get high and shit. So, it was just like, fucking really, really terrible. But this is a pretty damaged zine. He sent me a loaded syringe and it's real. You know, actually, I have his voicemails. He would call and leave them. So many times I've been sitting for so many days just like, "Fuck, when am I going to get out of here?" "This is the worst ever." And like, I feel like it's better to like die on your feet than live on your knees, sort of thing. Everybody was living a similar lifestyle and it wasn't until Dash passed away that people started to look at themselves and change themselves. It was a real kind of awakening for a lot of people. I think the person who misses out the most is Secret, 'cause he fucking loved her. She didn't get the Dash that we all got, you know, which sucks. I don't know.
