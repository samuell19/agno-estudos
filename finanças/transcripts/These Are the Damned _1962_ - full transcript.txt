(THUD) (LONE WHISTLER WHISTLES "BLACK LEATHER") You 'appy in your work, Joanie? (MAN) By the left, quick march. (ALL WHISTLE "BLACK LEATHER") (CAR HORN HONKS) You go back to London. (CHUCKLES) I should have given you some more warning. No, I'm always glad to see you. Could I have some tea, please? Then what's the matter? Have you let my birdhouse to a new girlfriend? No, no new girlfriend. The place is yours for this summer. I brought rent for two summers. (SHE HISSES) I call it my graveyard bird, ha! - How do you like it? Hmm? - This? I like this very much indeed. Would you like me to go back to London? I want you to stay, Freya. (BAND PLAYS "BLACK LEATHER" IN BACKGROUND) I love it here. I do my best work here too. Mr Wells, your passport. L...l think I better sit down for a minute. Come onto the terrace here. - (FREYA) Ohh! - Good evening, sir. - Are you all right? - Yes, thanks. - Shall I get a doctor? - No - Thank you. - Not at all. - How do you do? - Major Holland, Miss Freya Nielsen. - Welcome to Weymouth. - Thank you. Would you, uh, excuse my appearance, I've been sight-seeing. I gather he was beaten up by teddy boys. - (FREYA) But why? - They wanted my money, I guess. - Did you lose very much? - I wasn't carrying a lot. But why did they beat you up? (MAN) Here we are, this is what you need. Thank you. I'm sorry to put you to so much trouble. That's no trouble. It gives me an excuse to have one myself. - How are you, sir? - Captain Gregory, Miss Nielsen. How do you do? Captains and majors, huh? Do they both belong to you? Ay, and I keep a pet colonel in the kennel at home. You will excuse us, sir. Thanks again. Come on. Now...where did all this happen? Maybe he doesn't want to explain. I'll say this. I never expected this to happen to me in England. You thought it was a country of old ladies knitting socks. Let me put it this way. I expected you, but not the street gangs. The age of senseless violence has caught up with us, too. I'm sorry. I'm sure you're in no mood to listen to me moralising about your misfortunes. I like to listen to people who know what they're talking about. My trouble is, I never believe anything they say. - Good for you! - (WELLS) You think so? (FREYA) Yes, I do. (WELLS) I don't. The people who know all the answers are much happier. Heh, then why aren't you one of them? I just told you, I don't like the answers. I'd, uh, better wash my face. It's much easier to be polite when you're clean. Will you excuse me? I like him. I thought you would. I like him 'cause he doesn't like the world. It's a good beginning. - It's hardly enough, is it? - I agree. Your...military friends... ...do they belong to your mysterious project? Yes. - How is it going? - Very well. "Very well." Top secret. You know, someone once told me that... ...when a bureaucrat wants to keep his job, he stamps everything "top secret". Is that true? It's probably true, sometimes. L...hate your secrets, Bernard. Freya, if I were to tell you... ...even a little bit about what you call "my secrets"... ...I might be condemning you to death. Please trust my judgment. Now, would you like a drink before dinner or would you like to go in search of that Italian dish you...? (JAZZ MUSIC DROWNS OUT DIALOGUE) - How's that, then? - Not bad. - Let's have a go. I'll match it. - Five quid says you don't. All right, then. (GUNFIRE) (MAN) How's that, then? - How about that one over there? - But... Do you mind? I want to speak to my sister. What's the matter, Joanie? Make you feel big, playing with the American's money? Money's money, innit? - I wonder what kind of man he is. - Looking for pick-ups. Dirty. - Maybe. - Look, Joanie. It's you and me against the world. It's been this way since we was kids. He offered me his arm to cross the street. - Yeah? - Yeah! Real boy scout.

You couldn't be talking to me. Why are you doing it? There couldn't be any money in it. Is it for kicks? - Huh? - I'm gonna have a private yacht any day. I am very happy for you. Look, if you've got anything to say, please say it, otherwise move along. - "Or I'll call the cops." - Oh, you're much prettier out of jail. As long as you're not pulling your little games on me, you can do as you like. It takes two to play pretty little games. - Look, I invited you for a drink. - You didn't. You didn't invite ME anywhere. You invited a little tart you picked up on the street. Well, who are you, Lady Godiva? - That would make you peeping Tom. - Oh! Whoever I am, I'm not who you think. You never even asked my name. With a figure like that, you don't need a name. OK, OK, it's all my fault. I thought you were a little tart. I'll do better than that. I still think so. Now, what's your name? Joan. My name is Simon. - How do you do, Simon? - How do you do, Joan? - Tiny little thing. - Mm-hmm. - Why are you here? - I'm on holiday. - From what? - Everything. I used to be an insurance executive, but I decided to give it up. - It's a nice life. - What is? To be able to give it up. If you don't like what you're doing, I mean. (FOOTSTEPS) Your friends are never very far away. (COD AMERICAN) Allow me to correct you. - Joanie here is my sister. - You couldn't be. Oh, yes! I'm sure, your sort isn't interested in my sister. - That's why you send her in the streets? - Simon! - Get out of the boat, Joanie. - Stay where you are, Joan. If I was Simon, I'd let her go. Now, if you wanna go fishing, Simple Simon...you may go. - Don't do that again, Joanie. - I'll do what I like, King. Do you think I'll let a man put his dirty hands on you? (TRAIN WHISTLE BLASTS) - Go on! - Go home, Simon! - Just get him outta here. - Good riddance to bad rubbish! Don't forget your fishing rod, Simon. - He's outside the ten-mile limit! - And heave, heave! (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) Bye bye! Have a nice trip! Get on it. God Bless! Send us a postcard. (SINGING AND LAUGHING) - Get moving! - Pull your finger out! (WHISTLING) Come on, Joan. Give it up! (MAN) Ah, go on, Simon. (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) (KING) Hey! Joan! Jump! (JOAN) I'm glad he fell in the water! When you come back to shore, Simple Simon...you're a dead man. Joan? Sorry you came? No, I'm looking forward to spending the rest of my life out here. It might be nice. Oh, just ducky. Now that you've carried me off in such a rag style, whatcha gonna do? Can't go back to Weymouth. Look, I'm not afraid of King. Well, I am. Do you know what happened last time I went out with a man? I was locked in a cupboard for a week. Locked in a cupboard and I'm 20 years old. Don't you have any parents? No. King is all I've got. You should be glad to be rid of him. - Who says I am? - I do. Well, you're wrong. I'm stuck here in the middle of the ocean on a boat. And King is waiting for me to go back and for you. That isn't the only thing that's happened. You had the choice of staying with King or coming with me. Don't try and make anything of that. You had your whole life to make up your mind. You jumped out of pure instinct. - I'm not listening to you. - Don't be childish. - You don't want that gang. - I don't want you either, so shut up! - Why did you choose me? - You looked as if you had money. - Is that the only reason? - Yes. Why did you come back? (JOAN PANTS) Damn you, damn you, damn you! You are dirty! You're just what King said you were! (WAVES CRASHING) I'm gonna get a beer, do you want one? - I don't drink. - King's rules? Joan, I'm sorry. I was clumsy and brutal. It was my fault. - Will you forgive me? - For what? I want you to put me ashore, please, Simon. - What will you do about King? - That's my affair. I've got gas. We can go anywhere on the South Coast, to France if you like. I don't speak French. Look, why don't you go to France? - You can spend your life running away. - But I'd be running away from you. I have to live with what I've got. Please put me ashore. You'd go back to the gang? I know a place I can hide for a while, until he cools off. If you really want to go, there is nothing I can do to stop you. But I wish you'd stay. I won't have anybody to fight with. Please put me ashore, Simon. (MOTORBIKE ENGINE REVVING) (BERNARD) Pick me up at the Gloucester at three. (DRIVER) Yes, sir. (GULLS CRY) The bird in a gilded cage, eh, Dingle? More like a gilded bird in a rusty cage. These security chaps have the imagination of prison warders. - That shouldn't surprise you. - It irks me. What destroys me is the waste of our talents. Bernard was telling me of his last visit to the minister. "What kind of education?", says that noble person. Kind of education? Why, my kind of education? The fellow himself is a practically illiterate. What irks you, Dingle, is you can't accept somebody else's authority. If it were up to you, you'd turn all our children into beatniks. In the circumstances, would that matter? Unfortunately, we can't predict the circumstances. Self-reliance is all we can give them. Self-reliance, character, gentility. Do you think these values will mean anything, Gregory? I don't really think about that sort of thing. You're the sort that built the empire, aren't you? How did you do it without thinking? I'm out of my depth, I'm sure, but I'll have a shot at it. Any bully can command obedience. Only a gentleman can command loyalty. - (BERNARD) Good morning! - Good morning, sir. Draw the curtains, will you please? It's 11.55, switch that thing on, then. Good morning, children. (BERNARD) Sit up. I hope we're not in our rebellious mood, this morning. - We don't like being seen this way. - (BERNARD) There's no other way. We want to see you the way we see each other. Sit up, please. Now...this is our morning for questions, if you have any. - Sir? - (BERNARD) Yes, George? Mr Stuart told us that brothers and sisters can't marry. - Is that true? - (BERNARD) Yes. - None of you are brothers and sisters. - But, sir, there are nine of us. If any boy can marry any girl, there is gonna be one left. Your arithmetic is sound. You don't have to worry about that yet. Sir, I like the boxing, but the other boys won't fight with me. He hits too hard. (BERNARD) Charles, perhaps Mr Stuart could provide a punching bag, - not in person, of course. - (CHILDREN LAUGH) (GIRL) Sir? When we grow up, the girls, I mean, will we look like Miss Lamont? You will look as you do now. You will be bigger, of course. - (GIRL) This is a serious question, sir. - Then I shall do my best, Victoria. Sir, in your little talks to us, you talk about responsibility and duty and all of that. I'm very sorry if I seem pompous to you, Victoria. That's not it, sir. But you always talk about "when the time comes". We want to know when does the time come? There are many things which you'll only understand when you're older. You'll be told everything in time, each new thing as you're able to understand it, and not before. We're getting very old now, sir. And we can understand everything. You'll have to trust me and let me be the judge. It's not democratic, sir. That'll be all for this morning. It's time for your lunch. I'll talk to you again tomorrow. - Good morning. - (CHILDREN) Good morning, sir. (BERNARD) Some day, they'll have to be told everything. I wish there was a way to avoid it. What's that place? That? It's where some big shot lives. Sometimes he has a woman staying back here. She makes these things. Do you like them? Do you like them? I don't know. Shall we go in? You're planning on hiding out in here? Yes, what's wrong with that? - It must be locked. - Of course, it's locked. - Then I'll break the window. - Oh, now. You must have more respect for other people's property. Hey, they're at the birdhouse! Need any help? As much as I can get. - This is a fabulous place. - Do you really like it? You should see it in the fog. It's wild and weird. Those rocks, dissolving as if into cloud. I don't understand you. - Sometimes you sound like... - I can read. And sometimes like something entirely different. Are you planning to stay? I haven't made any plans. You can't exist on beer. I'll make you some food before you go back to the boat. I'll see what's left in the larder this time. - Ow! - What's the matter? I've cut myself on the blasted tin. This is all there is. Not even a packet of biscuits. - Lemme see that finger? - It's nothing. - Show it to me. - It's all right. It's terrible. Go on, eat. (WHISPERS) Joan... Please go back to the boat, Simon. You want me to? Yes. I'm frightened. Of your brother? - Of you. - You weren't frightened of me before. You hadn't kissed me before. I could keep right on kissing you. Look, I'm not holding you, and you haven't moved. Are you there? I've gone to Paris. - Where did you think I am? - I mean, are you there? Or are you thinking of something else? I'm not thinking at all. Good. Then you're happy. D'you think to stop thinking means you're happy? Sometimes. Sometimes it's the other way around. - But I'm not happy. - Why? - It doesn't matter. - Tell me. I didn't want to be just somebody's girl. Will you marry me? That's what you think now, of course. I've been married and divorced, I'm much older than you are, but I've never found this kind of quietness before. It's as if I were no longer afraid of dying. Then I'm lucky. Thank you, Simon. (CAR ENGINE WHIRRING) It's King! (CAR DOOR CLOSES) ls anybody there? I know I'm sloppy, but I'm not that bad. Two of them, hmm? (TAPPING) (CHUCKLES) This place is like a railroad station. What can I do for you, sir? Would you mind getting out of my bedroom? Where is Joanie? Er, ahem...well, I don't know. Where did they go? You might as well ask me where they came from... ...who they are? Uh, I don't have the faintest idea. If we're gonna have a conference on this subject, I think you'd better get out of here away from that bed. The man is your friend! Well, he may be, but the odds are against it. Oh, very humorous that is. - I don't like people making fun of me. - I sympathise. I know your kind. Smart talking, bad living. People with no morals. - My morals are different from yours. - You don't have any! You think this junk's all that matters? I've been here before. I've seen them. They're nasty, that's what. - That depends on how you look at them. - You think I ought to like 'em? Sure, don't you? What have my morals got to do with your Joanie? (SPITS) - Very strange boy! - I'm strange, all right. (CRASHING) I'll show you how strange I am. Is this what you make your junk with? Give me that thing. Give it to me! I don't have anything to do with your Joanie. (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) (SCREAMS) (FREYA GRUNTING) (SHE SOBS) (GASPING) You don't know how much this meant to me. How could you be so cruel?

(CRACK) (JOAN GROANS) Due six post A, due six post B! Make it snappy. Hurry along with those dogs. (JOAN SCREAMS) (OFFICER) The poor devils must've gone over. You're lucky to be alive, young man. Why? What kind of establishment is this, then? A morgue? Block C, conference room. His name is Simon Wells and he's an American. Major, what would I be likely to know about a bloke like that? You tell me. What's he got to do with your lot? - What's he got to do with your lot? - Be careful. You gave Wells a beating yesterday, today you're chasing him. Why? Major, Major, Major. (TUTS) I hope you remember my rights as one of our Majesty's loyal subjects. Your sort, they don't have any. That bothers me, that does. (BOY) She's moving. (PANTING) - Where are we? - Hush! No one is to speak! Take my hand, follow me. Your...your hand's as cold as ice! You're warm! She's warm! Could you just tell us where we are? Please, you mustn't speak, it's much too dangerous. Simon, Simon, her hand is as cold as ice. It doesn't get warm when I touch it. Well, we're... we're underground and it's pretty cold here. But your hand doesn't feel like this. It gets warm when I touch it. Hers doesn't. Wait. You may speak now, but not loudly. They don't have eyes here. He means television cameras. They watch us in other places. But they don't know about our hide-out. - Who are they? - Our teachers. - Could we talk to your teachers? - No, you can't do that. - Why not? - They're not here. If the eye saw you, Black Death would come, and take you away from us. - Haven't you come to save us? - To save you from what? I told you were wrong, Elisabeth. They don't know. Simon, I'm terribly cold. Children, even if we can't talk to your teachers, would you show us the way back? We could put you where we found you, but there's nowhere to go from there. - Please, stay with us for a little while. - We're soaking wet. Do you mind being wet? We don't mind being wet. Don't you catch cold? I don't know what you mean. - You have blankets and towels? - Yes. Richard will get you some blankets from the dormitory. Come on, children. You have to go to bed now, or they'll be bound to notice. - Can't we stay little longer? - No, do as I say. Can we touch before we go? You said she was warm. Would you mind? You see, they've never touched warm people before. It's all right. - Henry, where're you going? - I'm going to the screen, Victoria, - because I missed my turn. - You will be missed and punished. - You can have your turn tomorrow. - I don't care. You saw those two. And Richard saw a bird once. I have never seen anything! All right, go on, but don't be long. I'll make sure the others are in bed, then I'll come back. Thank you. (GRUNTING) We must be somewhere under that military establishment. We should let them know we are here, you'll get pneumonia. I'll be all right if I get dry. Let's stay at least till we find out what's going on. These children are locked up. (KING GASPING) (HENRY GRUNTING) The sea doesn't look dangerous from here, it looks very beautiful. But the cliff is dangerous, you must be careful. - Is there no way down? - No. Do you think you'll be comfortable? Have you decided to stay? First we need to ask some more questions. Let's begin at the beginning. - What's your name? - Victoria. Victoria, my name is Simon. And this is Joan. - There, I've saved your life. - (KING PANTING) I learned how to do it in gym classes. (KING) Terrible luck, old chap. Don't you want to come out now? And come inside? The others are in there already. - Inside where? - Inside here! (HENRY) Do you want me to help? (PANTING) Trust the boys of the bloodhounds to think up something like this. (WHIRRING) Do that again! Are you coming inside? - You said the others are in there? - They are! Forward into battle, dear chaps. Open it. (GRUNTING) - Open it. - I can't do that, not from inside. It doesn't work from inside. You're not allowed to talk here. Follow me. - How old are you, Victoria? - I'm eleven. We're all eleven. We have our birthdays in the same week. - How long have you been here? - We've been here always. What about your parents? Do they come and see you? Oh, we were hoping you were our parents. I see. Do you know why you're cold? There are some things, Simon, that you can't understand. You'll be told everything in time, each new thing as you're able to understand it, not before. - I found another one. - Don't tell lies, Henry. I did, I did! I found another one. I saved his life, Victoria. - Would you like a blanket too? - No. - Don't you mind being wet? - No. Is he warm too, Simon? Yes, Victoria. I almost drowned looking for you, Joanie. Before you get yourself excited, King, touch the little boy's face. (SCOFFS) - Joanie, I don't want... - Go on, touch the little boy's face. He's dead. He's dead, I tell you! Never mind, Henry. Never mind what he said. Victoria, I promise we'll stay until I find out how to help you. - Now go to bed, children. - Go to bed now. Go on. I don't sit questioning people about your private affairs, do I? I mean, your fence is your fence, all right. We didn't ask the yank to go jumping over it. Look, you don't want to know about a private quarrel, do you, Major? Let him go. Ah. Well, uh...much obliged to you, Major. Night, both. All that boy needs is a good thrashing. - Yes, but I don't think he's lying. - No. Come over here, Joanie. - Do what I say! - She's staying where she is. King, as much as I dislike you, you're still Joan's brother. Yes, that's right. Come over here, Joanie. Suppose we fight over Joan, after we get out of here. - Let's get out of here. - You have to wait. I promised the children that we'd stay here for the night. I didn't promise the zombies anything. I'm not gonna stay and watch the two of you. - What d'you think we're going to do? - Don't talk dirty, Joanie. It's you, King, who thinks dirty. You tried to lock me up, tried everything you can think of, to stop me from being a woman 'cause you never had a girl yourself. - It's not true, Joanie. - Yes, it is! I only want you out of the hands of men like that. Men like what? Any man, any man at all? Would you let me go with Ted or Sid or anyone? - No man, no man at all, that's true, King. - Just leave me alone. Leave me alone. (BREATHES HEAVILY) Just don't you put your hands on him, that's all. Or I'll kill you both. - And I'm gonna sit here and watch. - What d'you think I am? Come on...dry yourself. (WHIRRING) (FOOTSTEPS) (GONG RINGING) (GASPS) (FREYA) Watch you head. - Two intruders, you said? - No, no, three. Romeo and Juliet, and um, and the boy who broke my statue, unhappy, dangerous boy, I think. - Have you told the police? - No. Should I? - There is nothing they can do. - That's what I thought. This place seems to have a fatal attraction for lovers. - Now, why fatal? - It's just a phrase. Well...you can't blame the place for everything, darling. Times change, people with them. Sometimes it brings you closer together, sometimes it doesn't. Did I change so much, other than becoming old and ugly? What would that matter, hm? You have become a man with a purpose. - You have a purpose too. - Yes, but I... tell mine to anyone who cares to listen. Yours is a secret purpose. I'm a public servant. You didn't have to become one. I felt I had no choice. It's too late to do anything in private life. Too late, why? I live with one fact. A power has been released that will melt those stones. We must be ready when the time comes. You really believe it's going to happen? Certainly, there's absolutely no question. - There's nothing we can do to prevent it? - Nothing. (WHISPERS) Well... (CLUCKS) Back to work, back to work. I don't believe that. Excuse me, sir, may I have a word with you? We found nothing, sir. We're looking for three people. (CHUCKLES) A public servant is the only servant who has secrets from his master. I'm very sorry to leave you with the last word. - Duty calls? - Duty calls. (MAN ON TAPE) My hair is grey, but not with years, nor grew it white in a single night as men's have grown from sudden fears. My limbs are bow'd, though not with toil, but rusted with a vile repose, for they have been a dungeon's spoil, and mine has been the fate of those to whom the goodly earth and air are bann'd, and barr'd, forbidden fare. (SIGHS) - What's the matter, Joan? - My head hurts. I must get some air. I brought you something to eat. - What is it? - Lunch! Is this what you eat? Yes, it has all the minerals and vitamins. We make it ourselves in the lab. Were you ever a child, Holland? You don't expect me to answer that one, sir. There's always one child missing. It's been like that for two days. - Going to the hide-out. - Yes. I should like permission to investigate it. Have you never had a secret hiding place? In all this time, Holland, you've never had anything more to worry you than one stray rabbit. The mental health of the children is more important than your ideas of security. That will be all, Holland. Thank you very much. I have more serious problems, sir. Try to confine yourself to the practical side of it and don't explain the scientific details to me. You know that I'm against the present arrangement. That's not your province, Talbot. We must be ready when the time comes. It makes observation more difficult, and we don't know enough - about maintaining their immunity. - Well? Remember how we lost the other two? - What is it, Talbot? - Mary is developing the same symptoms. (MAN) Mary, Mary, you're going to have an injection. (SHUDDERING) It comes in spells, Joanie. A chill doesn't come in spells. It's, it's, being locked up that does it. I'll be all right. (GIRL) We think we're being punished for our sins in a dungeon, like the prisoner of Chillon. When the time comes, our parents will open the magic doors. (BOY) There's no such thing as magic. What about the facts? - What facts, William? - We're on a spaceship going to a star. They're teaching us the history of earth so we can build a civilisation when we get there. By the time we get there our teachers will be dead. That doesn't take account of the rabbit. - The rabbit was on board all the time. - Tell me about the rabbit. - We found it one day. - We used to play with it. But it grew sleepy and its hair fell out. And the Black Death took it away. We can't tell you everything now. We've gotta get you out of here. Will you show me the doors? There's the cave door, and there's the lift - where the Black Death comes down. - And? - But there's another door. - Would you take me there? - No he can't, the eyes will see him. - That doesn't matter. - I worked out all the blind spots. - We don't have much time. - What is it, Simon? - Don't worry, just wait for me! - (BERNARD) Good morning. - I thought you'd better see this yourself. Here on five. I wish you had let me investigate that hide-out, sir. - Sir? - On seven. - What's he doing? - He's following one of the children. Very ingenious of young William. But he forgot that Wells is six feet tall. Turn them off. I hate those things! - But they are necessary! - It is not necessary of you to tell me so. - The others may be dead or with him. - If he went over the cliff when the tide was right, he could've reached the cave. There must be something wrong with the cave door. - Unless he didn't go over the cliff. - Check the birdhouse door. Make sure Miss Nielsen doesn't see you. Take the boat, check the cave entrance. When we find out how he got in, we'll worry about getting him out. He's been there too long already. I do not want the children to watch him die. It's just an ordinary lock on this side. What is a lock, Simon? - Good afternoon, Miss Nielsen. - Good afternoon. - Hope I'm not interrupting anything? - No. Name's Gregory, remember we met the other day. I remember you. - You're one of Bernard's toy soldiers. - (GREGORY) Yes. I've been promising myself I'd come and see your work some day, by way of improving my mind. (FREYA) Very clever. Very clever. It's a very interesting effect, that. - Sort of unfinished, really, isn't it? - Well, now... Isn't everything in life, sort of, unfinished, hm? Well, I never really thought of it like that. - May I come in? - Please, please. Thank you. (ENGINE REVS) I hope you don't mind silly questions? As long as you don't mind my silly answers. Shouldn't I? (LAUGHS) If I could explain these, I wouldn't have to make them. Yes, quite. Thank you, Miss Nielsen. You've been very kind. - Nothing at all. Come again. - Thank you. All clear, Captain. I'm Sid. Yes, I've noticed you hanging around. Perhaps you notice other things, too. Where's King? I hope your sense of humour is better than him. Yeah, I'm laughing all the time. We haven't seen him since he came here. Would you like me to find him? Yeah, maybe you know where he is. Maybe you know where the brass is knocking about in your quarry. (FREYA) Hmm. (BELL RINGING) (BERNARD) Quiet, please. Order, please. - Mary's not here. - Don't worry about that, Victoria. Mary is to stay in bed. I've called you together at this unusual time because it's important and I want you to cooperate with me. I know you have some big people in your hide-out. I know about your hide-out and I want you to keep it. I will not be able to let you keep it, unless you help me. Is that understood? If you will not help me, I'll take your hide-out away from you. Now, Victoria, how many of these "big people" are you hiding? Don't be stubborn, children, it's very important. Big people are dangerous to you. How did they get inside? Very well, I can find out all that later. Victoria, go to them and tell them to come out. Tell them to come to the lift, we'll get them out. - We want to keep them here, sir. - You cannot. I'm very sorry to tell you this. But here is dangerous for them. They'll become ill, they'll go sleepy if they stay with you. They are warm, and nothing that's warm can live with you. You'll remember what happened to the rabbit. You're just trying to frighten us, sir. We don't believe you. You killed the rabbit 'cause we loved it. You sent the Black Death 'cause we loved it. I love you, I'm trying to protect you. You don't! (IN UNISON) You don't! You don't! (BERNARD) Think, children, think, think. You will have to do as I say. (HENRY) King! King, where are you? King, the Black Death is coming. They're gonna take you away! - What is it, Henry? - He's coming for you. You'll get sleepy like the rabbit. We're gonna get out and take you with us. - You climb out and open the cave door. - What good's that? - The other door needs a key. - You can climb these cliffs? - We'll have to swim. - Through those rocks with the kids? - Let them come for us. - Don't go, King! No! (MUFFLED CRY) King, you've seen too much. Are you coming, or not? Thank you. I know it's kid stuff, knocking about in a gang. But what else is there to do? - What would you like to do? Hm? - I don't know. Something you want to do, now. Guard, bring the dinghy in. I have had to send someone down because of your disobedience. (CHILDREN SHOUTING) (BERNARD) Children! (INDISTINCT) (BERNARD) This is a crisis. You do not understand what is happening. Think! Think! You will have to do as I say eventually. (SHUDDERS) (BERNARD) You'd better come out, Howard. We can't direct you. (GUNFIRE) (CRYING) (HOWARD GROANS) Let me go, man, for God's sake. Let me go. All I want is that key. Get rid of it, throw it away! Throw it away! - Why are you so afraid of this, Major? - Because we'll go blind, man! (CLICKING) Get up. Give me that thing. I'll have that. - Won't do you any good now. - Well, let's be equal. Watch him. Joan! (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) I'm getting you all out of here. (CLICKING) (CLICKING INCREASES IN SPEED) (CLICKING SLOWS) (CLICKING INCREASES IN SPEED) I want you getting out of these clothes first. Go on, take 'em off. All of you. - Simon, we can't! - Don't argue, take them off. - We can't undress in front of each other. - You do as I say. All right, children, undress. (CLICKING SPEEDS UP) (CLICKING SPEEDS UP DRAMATICALLY) That's correct, Wells. The children themselves are radioactive. The children? - What in heaven's name are you doing? - You can't be expected to understand. - I'm taking them out of here. - You can't, they're dangerous! - Please Simon, take us out! Please! - Please! Please! - You can't do it, Wells, you can't! - Can't I? Come on, children. Can we put our clothes on? Yes, it doesn't matter now. Do you understand what you're doing? - Do you understand what you're doing? - Yes, certainly. Tie him to the bed. Tie him to the bed! Come on, Joan. We can't wait. - I want to go too, Joan. - We can't leave her, Simon, she's sick. Be careful. (GREGORY) The children were opening the locks with the radiation of their bodies. We needn't worry about the cave door, because I've checked it. Take a complete detachment to this door. Alert the helicopters, in case they get any farther. And if Miss Nielsen is at the studio, make sure she doesn't see anything. And hurry. Yes, sir. Hello! Anybody there? (JOAN) Here we are, my little love. Take a look. That's the world. - I'm frightened. - Don't be frightened. Look, here's something small, it's a little flower. - No! - Leave me! (SCREAMING) (CHILDREN SCREAM) (FREYA GROANS) - Let me down! - (SCREAMING) - Go away, Henry! - No! I'm coming with you, King! They're children, Bernard. - Gregory! - Yes, sir? Henry's gone! In the car. (SIMON) I've seen you before. You know all about violence. You're the man who knows all the answers, aren't you? Why are you doing this? What's it all for? What are you trying to make out of these children? What do you want with us? Answer me! Will you answer me? - Where is Major Holland? - He's down there? - Is he alive? - He's alive. Gregory, get him out of there as quickly as possible. Yes, sir. Mr Wells, you and the young lady may go to your boat. Children, Bernard! The worst of this incident is that my children will now think of themselves as prisoners and as freaks. - Did you do this thing to them, Bernard? - They were born as they are. Their mothers were exposed to an unknown kind and level of radiation by an accident. I don't need to tell you that there are such accidents. Three hundred in the past fifteen years. That is a fact. We don't yet know how to repeat the exact conditions that produce these children. - You mean you would if you could? - Certainly. (SIGHS) Freya. Freya. It is now desperately important that you should try to understand me and what I'm doing. Life has the power to change. After the first great explosion, strange wonderful flowers, unknown before, bloomed in the desert. To survive the destruction that is inevitably coming, we need a new kind of man. An accident gave us these nine precious children. The only human beings who have a chance to live in the conditions which must inevitably exist when the time comes. Every civilised nation is searching, searching for the key to survival that we have found. - I don't want to hear anymore. - I didn't want you to know. You will remember my warning when you arrived. - You let the American and the girl go? - They are dying already. They won't make contact with another human being. When they die, the boat will be destroyed. Freya, you too, know my secrets now. My children are the buried seeds of life. When that time comes, the thing itself will open up the door and my children will go out to inherit the earth. What earth, Bernard? What earth will you leave them? After all that man has made and still has to make! Is this the extent of your dream? To set nine ice-cold children free in the ashes of the universe. I have no choice, I have no choice at all. You refuse to join me. - You know what your refusal means. - Yes. It means that you are wasting whatever time I have left. Whoosh, whoosh! It goes so fast, King. The world's so big! Get out now. I can't take you anywhere. Go back, Henry. I can't! Not now. I don't like it back there. - The others don't like me very much. - Get out of the car. - Look after yourself. - I saved your life, I mean to stay here. You're poison. Don't you know you're poison? You're killing me. (HENRY SCREAMING) Help! (GRUNTING) We can start again, Joan. We can go back to the beginning. We can't, Simon. We can't leave the children.
