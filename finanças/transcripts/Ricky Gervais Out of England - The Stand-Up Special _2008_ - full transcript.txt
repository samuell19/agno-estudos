We managed to raise thousands of dollars or one hundred pounds, as you prefer. As to trãiþi in a third world country? I know what you're thinking. Ricky Gervais Still busy with charity? May tãceþi! No more ... "Fac prea mult". Ba nu, deloc. "As we gathered last year, only for cancer?" It does not matter. For what? "Dan-ne estimate the sum." Millions ... Millions ... And I hope to be welcomed. Give vã spun pole, If I ever make cancer, I will go into the nearest hospital and have to say, "Well, I paid for that equipment, daþi chelul wing mic or part of the de-acolo. " Speaking about small keys nenorociþi, Last year I thin a show for teenagers with cancer. This? At the Royal Albert Hall. I thin and earlier, in 2006. But they called me again last year. "Inca Suntem bolnavi!" Athi rezistat ... There is a nice show. Adolescents with cancer have free entry. A º a eu sunt. It brings up to the forefront, lucky them ... And I can come backstage after the show to meet me. How great it can be for them. Much better than to go to Disneyworld, where they can be bad, given their state. While, you know me ... Maximum. So thin now show the second time, I look and I recognize one of them. It was two years ago backstage. He told me about his illness, and I've signed some autographs you, And he told me how that turned 18 and how hard it was ... And I said, that was 2 years ago. Means that now has 20. The khan of the of ce naiba adolescent and Inca? Lying bastard ... Not lie in respects of cancer, and it hurt when he laughed, but it would be ... ª the decision and the IMI continuam spectacolul º º râdea the râdea, "Da, Razi you ..." I seethed with anger.

Nu vor s-Auda eg nimeni cã if SUPARA pe mine." "Face-te!" Health all! It's a big box, right? Nu MÃ two mare. But we want to know that is large box, not that I am a dwarf. I thin a show charity last year for autism. And like most, my only experience related to autism, until recently, he was Dustin Hoffman º i know prestaþia extraordinarã din "Rainman". I recently purchased a new home in London and neighbors are all walking around there ... "Salut ..." Bãgau º Î º i i i nasul, practic. But I thought, "to be nice to them, for now." "When I raise my high fence, you can go to hell." And a couple had a son with autism. And his mother was talking to me, "Hey, this is Douglas is 17." "It never comes-out because he has no friends." So I thought, "This is a good opportunity to show that I'm not just rich that guy on TV ci º khan i am from the Inimá aur ". ª i am i-spus "IE scale with el." "-Serious?" "-Da." So get back on a Saturday and I. .. She tells me that he likes the zoo. Which is only one kilometer away from my new house. The so so ... walking down the street ... by Douglas ... And he did not take his eyes and his mother all the way, as I was walking down the street. And his mother to stand on the threshold of the door, making them by hand, crying ... Finally close the door and go inside. Eu opresc a taxi, "the cazinou Duceþi-tion." Should you choose and you with something, right? So ...

Pot sã VAD º º i had cã sunt fit, de-AICI" Why I stuck with this? So I went back home and I told her and her mother, "It was a mistake." "It works like Rainman, but it has nothing to isteþime shit." I know it's wrong ... I do not like to talk about it, but do a lot of charity shows. But I mentioned some causes worth more than others. Leaving the joke aside, obviously deserves attention cancer, autism also but recently I was asked to give a show of charity for those suffering from obesity. "Ce?" She answers me, "For those who suffer from obesity." Eu... "I referi the oamenii gra º i?" She answers me, "No, because obesity ..." Well, actually said ... Because eating. ª Tithi, Intre gustãri.

"Oh nu, mã Ingra No ... uite, mã Ingra No ..." "Scaunele din avion." "I'm not big enough for someone like me." No, they are not. Because if it is, I climb nenorociþi only 12 people on the plane. "Nu-i just." Ba this! Aichi behave! And if we're talking about is just the ticket ... of the maximum weight of my luggage must be the same as a standard 200 kg? Both we must toffee up to 32 kg in flight. No, no, and he has already used 32 kg in Thathi! Nu this Boal. I saw a documentary when I was in England, a woman weighing 160 kg.

"Look, I'll check chiloþii Do you later." I chiloþii after you have checked? Maybe the so happens again. I never ever thought, "It would be good to check my chiloþii."

I can not say the so simply, Ricky Gervais, humorist. Say something like, "Ricky Gervais, humorist plinuþ." Why do you say that? Why? Why to add something? You can not be more specific than saying the full name ... "Ricky Gervais..." "Cu ce ​​ocupã themselves?" "Umorist." "Ricky Gervais, umoristul ..." "Grãsanul, da, IL º tiu!"

I do not want to talk about it, but I ... One of the great works of charity in which I was involved, Several years ago, while working at the University of London, Terrence Higgins was Fund, the largest fund for AIDS charity in the UK. Was going through the 80's, and yet people still ask, What's new thing called AIDS? It is doing well, has gone around the world, E Global. Are º i ziua ei ... 1 decembrie, Ziua Mondiala Shida. I do not think you get to have Christmas aura. Pentru khan ... emanates ° to the negative energie. And card companies have missed the opportunity. Usually they throw in everything before them again. Pothi naked face of rost carduri "Do Rau firewall aveþi AIDS." Does not exist. Or stuff-those who sing a short song to cheer someone. A suitable song. I do not know which would be suitable song ... No matter ... Not always keep this number in San Francisco ... Oh, mai dad! However I learned something fascinating while working at Terrence Higgins Fund. People always learns something new in my sermons. Tell you something absolutely true ... The first HIV virus was a combination of two viruses and different who engaged in dwarf monkeys and created a rudimentary form of AIDS. Then passed from chimpanzees. Chasing monkeys and chimpanzees sometimes eat them. A º cimpanzei in the evolution, and because we are able to 98.6% identical to chimpanzees, genetically speaking, was possible to pass to humans. And the first person who contacted AIDS installments of chimpanzee meat, No tãiat the deget and healthy. Although, that's the excuse I would have found it and I ... You have to come with an excuse when you go to the doctor, "I feel very sorry, Doctor." "Nu mã surprinde" "E ° t om care Primula has contracted AIDS." "Cum m-a ° fi cu ales pole?" "DOUA posibilitãþi ..." "Unu ..." "I trãgeai eg the spate unui cimpanzeu." "Eu, unui cimpanzeu ...?" "I trãgeam unui cimpanzeu ..." "În nici a cat on." "When the o fi altfel Putuo iau growl?" "Nu º tion, tran ay º º cimpanzeu of meat and tea-ai tãiat the deget ..." "Aia!" "Chestia ciopârþitul cu ..." I bet that went straight into the jungle and found the chimp that. "I Nenorocitule-ai dat AIDS." "THI-AM gives ce?" "I-ai dat AIDS." "Thi-am dat a blowjob." "Am tine AIDS." "Unde th eu i am Luat AIDS?" "The lack maimuþe." "I mãnânc maimuþe naked." "I missed the Ori, the gold-or trãgeai." "The mâncam." Give ... The coolest thing I learned while working for AIDS charity fund is that it is the best in the world and waving. This is a really waving and published by Terrence Higgins Fund. It was published at the university where I worked, in 1999. ª i .. It was adresat populaþiei masculine homo, that still does not protect, and who treated HIV risk like any other occasion. Admit the existence of the virus, but not taking precautions and. So this last demographic group was asked where the information enters harder. On the front is a picture with you some bananas, and write the word "fuck". No ce Nu ting naked º tion ... In principle a plan with 10 points ... with health tips for avoiding contracting HIV. This is the title and the waves. You will know that you have something good, when you say that's the title ... Sunteþi pregãtiþi? "You know, you should not always do anal sex?" Bine the E º tiut, now? Think of an old couple in the waiting room at the doctor. Rãsfoind principles Reader's Digest ... ª and the Zice, "Ce and auction?" "You know, you should not always do anal sex?" "Vezi, Thi-am SPUS eu!" In principle there are 10 suggestions ... alternative act. I will read a few. Numãrul unu ... It's real. Numãrul unu ... "From what sã naked ..." Mereu începe the fel, "From what sã naked ..." This puþin subtil, nu forces you, give ... Numãrul unu ... "De ce nu sã vã masturbaþi reciproc?" Gândiþivã the horn ... "Am Noul Flutura º, Larry." "There Zice?" "Pai sã vedem ... You sã FACEM a chiar acum." "Without pulled back from now on.'s Number one ..." "De ce nu sã vã masturbaþi reciproc?" "Bine ..." Number two ... Mereu începe the fel, "From what sã naked ..." Number two ... "Why not ejaculate on his back?" It naturaleþea with that said ... As if such a prescription. "Why not add an onion ...?" As if you go to the doctor, "Buna ziua doctore, sunt homo, i am the relaþie of mi-nu sound and teamâ iau AIDS." "This pot face?" "Oh, ejaculate on his back!" Number three ... Number three ... I read it all cunoscuþilor, and laughed at number one and two, and when I got to number three ... Number three ... "Why not ejaculate in his hair?" Nu în Par ... Nu în pair. Back, for sure. "Pe spate, you." "Pe spate. Spate eg You." "Unde Naib Thinta first you ass nurse? Naked!" "Nu pe pair, nu!" Acolo! " "Acolo!" "I trust you, I put my shower cap." Nu în Par ... Number four ... Never before or after, I found so useful term "eg." (For example) that in the next sentence. Number four. "De ce nu încerci only ..." Try ... Maybe people think that's a little more difficult, so it's phrased as a request. Not neurosurgery, next, but put "try". "De ce nu only ..." "Why not try to ejaculate into a fruit ..." " Eg. lubeniþã? " As if, without the example of this, the world would be asked ... "Ce fruct FEL Or nu, nu one ananas!" "Ce fel of fruct?" "Trebuie sã fie never tans º i, there FRUCT?" - "Ce fel of fruct?" - "Lubeniþã". "Mulþumesc." And so on a ... I want to jump straight to number ten. Because this may be the best phrase ever written. ªi îl includ pe Shakespeare, Dickens... "The Office"... Mulþumesc. Sunteþi pregãtiþi? Number ten ... I think the guy who wrote those already struggling ... I think he went to his chief and said: "Am terminat, reu am gãsesc Noua sound of it." And his chief: "Oh no, we need ten." "Adevãrat?" "From there, it trebuie zece." "Am a novelty." "I Chiar trebuie zece." "I ejaculated hair in fruit at all ..." "We have ten, we need two rows of five." "... Two rows of five, clearly." "Bottom simetria place." "Think back to another one, you have a half an hour." "Intrãm the tipar, ..." She returned to her office where she devised and the tenth, a minute before six o'clock, I think. Number ten. Tot cu "De ce nu only ..." Number ten. Absolut adevãrat. Gata? "Why not ejaculaþi both out the window?" I do not even say if it's on the ground floor window. "Buna dimineaþa ..." "No, this is number 17, number 19 is opposite ..." That's why I consider waving and my favorite of all time, thanks. Distractiv º i educativ. Always trying to educate me. I've reached the age where I need knowledge. I feel guilty that I do not know enough. I had a good education, but I knew to make use of it. I no longer watch TV degrading. Now that I'm home ...

Zic: "It was prost, u º or influenþabil, nu to vrut sã FACA auction ..." Cum Adica naked vrut make sound ... asta? Never zic: "Nu, a fost de influenþat filosoful politic, Friedrich Nietzsche." Because Nietzsche wrote a book that talked about super-humans said that not all men are created equal. And Hitler interpreted this wrong and deviated much from the topic. Think about it, you are a great scholar, You wrote this thing and receives a call from your Führer, who Did say "Toate bune, Nietzsche?" "Da, toate bune, this golden º ti?"

Health. Aplaudaþi not that, I should talk about something like that. It is as if we were at peace now. Something happens now, in a country called Iraq, a war that is not my favorite. My favorite is war ... There are so many ... Are good for different reasons. Insulele People Land. Perhaps Folkland islands. Because we won there. ª i .. It was great, was against Argentina. Da ... Ciudat. Go to war against Argentina? Go, why not. The reason is that the war was artillery. This means that Argentine guns could shoot up to 9 km, and the British could shoot up to 17 km. So do we parked boats ... 10 km away. Theirs cãdeu a great ... and we cook them. War is equivalent to the distance Dwarf Holding a hand, shake it all, and you shoot them and beverages in boas and E, and a Vietnam, best soundtrack. World War II, the best final.

Not the greatest, the greatest idol of mine is ... Nelson Mandela. What man does not? An extraordinary man. Întemniþat for 25 years, was released in 1990, 18 years ago, º i nu to recidivat. I think it's on the right track. This demonstrates that our prison institution operates. Last year we learned about one of your heroines U.S., Rosa Park. It celebrated 200 years of the abolition of slavery in Britain last year. We took a little before that. No ToTu I, happy. Felicitari ... Abolition of slavery did not mean the end of racism. Racism was rooted in society, Until the 50 and 60 in England and in America. And that incident was the spark that triggered the civil rights movement. A young black woman, Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat to a white bus. The so was the law, but it is saturated. And was arrested for it. But then, the law was changed. But it did not stop there. And has started to hide the places reserved for disabled ... He spoke with the driver, as he drove ... Have money for the ticket change? He ass ... Some people ... Health. There are political comedy ... I used to talk about politics, the young Aram. At 15, 16 years ago, when I became aware ... Well, it only does it to annoy the parents, obviously. But ... I think we flood policy at an early age. Everything is so charged by politics, morality, the way we live. It's everywhere, fables, children's songs, sayings ... I remember when we six years, I had a meeting in kindergarten, 're all coming every Monday of the week, our Turkish ezam of the fish, and the director came and told us a story. And every time have a moral that we should think, and that we would have to make ... the great leaders of mankind ... Character building ... And take an eternity ...

The sun was high in the sky ... Ripple springs ... There were flowers, fruits were ... Were peanuts. And I oarecele lazy, crazy run in the sun, bite of a fruit and discard the rest. There were a lot of fruit, it will never end. You get industrious and he oricelul a fruit binenþeles but eat it all and put another one the one hand, for winter. He knew ...
