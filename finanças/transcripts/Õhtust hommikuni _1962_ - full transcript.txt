What men I have, both like making everything wet. Good morning, Salme. - Oh look, our city girl is up. The mattress wasn't too hard? - No. A good sack of straw. I'm simply lost for words. And so homely and quiet, as if there wasn't a war on. Yes. Thank god it has passed us by. But what's it like elsewhere? My old man was always smart. Locomotive is a good spot during war. Want some bread, Stripy? My god... From the camp... I couldn't go on. Leaave. Leave. I can't leave right now. It's daytime, freezing. No. The Germans will come. - Don't fear. They don't know yet. I'm begging you, please leave. I have a child. A child, a small child. Leave. - I will at night. No, leave. All right. No. What is it? Salme, the boy is hungry. What's that? An air raid? No, something's up at the prison camp again. A prison camp? Where? Here? No, you can't see it from here. Past that bit of forest there. A fugitive, what else. The patrols will be here soon. Why do they keep running away? They won't escape. Some madman takes pity, both'll be by the wall by morning. What are you saying! I've broken a sleeve feeding the engine in this cold. Please sew it up, darling. You and your worries over the world. Be a darling, sew it up. But what if people helped. - Helped? I wouldn't know how. A passport check and they're caught. Dear god, my documents. I haven't been to the police. What is it with you today? Ruudi... I'm scared today. Of a house search? Don't be silly. Salme, house documents? - In the table drawer. I can't leave right now. Daytime, freezing. Freezing, freezing... Come inside. Come, it's warm here. Take it off. Hurry. What's your name? Name. Grisha. What's yours? - Salme. Wait. You cannot go, a patrol. Come. Come. Quickly. Come, sleep. How do you mean, sleep? Where is he, your husband? At work. When the Germans come, how do I escape? - No need. You are Rudolf. - Rudolf? My husband. Engineman. I'm Rudolf? Your husband, an engineman? Sleep, sleep. Oh? - What is it? Sleep, sleep. It is difficult, Salme. Why did you run away? At the camp, you would maybe have survived. But now... The camp - life... Life. Life? Life at the camp? No. I'm going to the partisans. The camp... I had no other option, Salme. This is life. Life. Forgive me. I have to leave. - No. Oh, it's you. What a blizzard. It's all right, sleep. - Salme! You're not sleeping either. A grim night. Somewhere, people are sitting at a cafe, listening to music. Do you think they'll come here as well? They've never missed a house. Do you think someone took him in? Did someone really dare? Yes... A lucky one who can say: "I saved someone's life." Karin. - Yes? The prisoner is here, in our house. No, no! Yes, Karin. He is here, in our room. Salme... Salme, they'll shoot us. Salme, I don't want to die. Do you hear me? - Does he want to die? I'm leaving. I'm leaving right now. Karin! Open up, this is field commander. Stay where you are! This is a house search. Here is our fugitive. People lie, but things do not. Lieutenant, there's a man laying in bed. Is that so? The man sleeps, but the pretty wife does not. In here! Come, Ruudi. Personal identification and registration. Show them to me! Excuse me. A locomotive driver? - Yes. How old? Something. - Two, three... What are you saying? He is ill, he came from work in this cold. - What are you saying? I can't. Unfortunately, she doesn't speak German. He is ill, caught a cold. Miss Karin Varend, is it not? Please. A locomotive driver? Keep searching! - Yes, lieutenant. Hurry up! Are you tired, my beautiful lady? Please. Lieutenant, I found a chimney sweep's clothes. A chimney sweep? What do you say to that? Where is the man himself? We bought the house from a chimney sweep. What was that? They bought the house from a chimney sweep. - Thank you. Be careful, he's about to die. Lieutenant, the things show that a railway worker lives here. - Good. You need a strong drink, you know. You need a better husband, missis. - Shut your trap. Outside, now. Good bye, my beautiful lady. The road. - Where do I go, left or right? That way. - Left? From there, you go two kilometres. Two kilometres. Another three kilometres to the forest. Three. House, father, home. You understand? - I do. So we had visitors? What's the meaning of this? This is the fugitive, Ruudi. Have you lost your mind? You could have thought of the child. Get this man out! - Ruudi... Grisha! A patrol. Was it really necessary? Was it? It was, Ruudi. We're done for. Forgive me, Ruudi. Come, Ruudi, you must be hungry. The end. Translated by Kati Metsaots Subtitles by Mardisupp OÜ
