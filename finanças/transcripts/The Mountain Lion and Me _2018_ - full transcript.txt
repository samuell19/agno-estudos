♪ Casey: This is my home in montana, paradise valley, On the outskirts of yellowstone national park. These are my neighbors: Bears, Wolves, elk, deer. It's a blend of homes, ranches and wildlife. I'm casey anderson, a wildlife filmmaker. The kill. I live amongst this amazing backdrop, Filming all the creatures that call this home. But there's one animal that's really Captured my imagination. Go see what we got. An animal so secretive, few ever get to see it, The mountain lion. And on one snowy night in the middle of winter, A female decided to pay me a visit. One thing's for sure, she's here. And I was captivated. I entered her world. I'll call it mama mo's hunting cave. I watched as this incredible mother Devoted her life to the survival of her young. Since that chance encounter, I've been In the tracks of a mountain lion, And she's been watching me. ♪ [owl hooting] ♪ It began one winter night, when I'd been Away filming in yellowstone. So, kind of crazy, I am in yellowstone Looking for mountain lions, and then I get home, And there's fresh mountain lion tracks Crossing my bridge. He came right here. Some people would be worried out here Walking around at midnight looking for mountain lions. Come home, And guess what? That night was the beginning of my relationship With a lion I would come to call mama mo. Look here. So I've got these tracks, brand new, In my driveway, walking right across my bridge. This cat was just in my back yard. At that point, it's like, is this just The cat passing through. Nonetheless, excited because there's fresh Mountain lion tracks in my yard. My house is in paradise valley, montana, Just on the northern border of yellowstone national park. I'm surrounded by perfect mountain lion habitat, But I've never had one walking through my yard before. And this cat, which I think is a female, Based on the size of the tracks, Literally looked in my window and walked down my steps. ♪ She went on that way. I'm gonna continue to follow her. One thing's for sure, she's here. She lives in my backyard, or I live in her backyard. A mountain lion is one of the hardest Animals to film or even get your eyes on, And to have one literally come to your Doorstep and say, "hey, here I am" As a wildlife filmmaker, it's really a dream come true. So I began to track this cat. It was winter. There was snow on the ground, And every morning, I could see her tracks And follow where they went. Oh yeah, right here. Going right over here by the wood pile, Through the barbed wire fence. Still going. Through the junipers here. A lot of work. Near the edge of my property is an abandoned homestead, A collection of buildings and barns, All intact, but nobody's lived there for years. Her tracks went past my house and then down To this old ranch. It has always been this mysterious place to me, Where I always wondered if wildlife were Using these old buildings. But then seeing the mountain lion's tracks Going down towards it on a regular basis And walking in there for the first time, I started looking around, and it's unbelievable. There are carcasses everywhere, Like, remnants of her kills. It looks like this cat is killing things Right here in this ghost town And dragging the bodies into these buildings. And I knew that I needed to figure out Exactly what was happening here. ♪ Walking into the building and seeing all these Carcasses was like walking into a serial killer's basement. Almost every one of these buildings Has a dead mule deer like mummified inside of it. It makes perfect sense. This is a perfect hunting ground. We see deer around these buildings all the time. They get inside these buildings to get out of the wind. And it's also perfect to use these buildings To sneak up on them. But, when it's windy out here, all this Rattling and creaking will actually disguise Her footfall as she's sneaking up. ♪ A mountain lion always caches its kills So they can come back and feed on the carcass For several days, so I knew, at that point, She was going to come back. And I wanted to be there. ♪ So I set up my camera traps and waited. [sighs] it's gonna be a long night. I'm gonna find out who this cat is, But then you start to forget. What am I doing? I'm putting a blind in an old building, And I'm gonna sit here all night with a cat That's killing mule deer regularly? I'm gonna sit here by myself in the dark? You know, as the sun goes down, it starts To seem more like a haunted house Rather than an old, cool ghost ranch. I'm just gonna go quiet mode, Just sit here and wait. Could be two minutes, could be never. [laughs] Could be hours, just a waiting game. ♪ And there she was, An adult, female mountain lion. And this big, beautiful female cat, She's the one that's been walking in my yard. She's the one that's killing all these deer At this ghost ranch. And my heart is pounding. Most mountain lion's, when they make a kill, Are gonna hide it in the bushes or cover it up somehow, So the scavengers don't steal it. But this cat's hiding her kills In these buildings instead. Mountain lions are amazing at adapting To living next to humans. It's not just pure wilderness around here anymore. There are people and farms, And she's found a way to use that to her advantage. I can't even think of a better night. I don't care how creepy it is. It's completely worth the wait. Snow is a blessing. It means I can track her and see where she Goes after she leaves the homestead. These cats are invisible, But even invisible animals will leave a footprint. And what I soon discover is that this female Is walking through my backyard on a regular basis. Here I go again. Female, she came through my yard last night, Under my deck, over the bridge, by a lot Of my camera traps, and I just got a couple Of little images. So now, I know these tracks are less than 24 hours. She's definitely hunting, so I'm just gonna stay on 'em. Maybe she made a kill, And I'll walk right into it. But she is whoopin' my butt. Talk about not having to go to the gym. Just follow a mountain lion around. It's amazing. You learn a lot, though, by just following the tracks. ♪ I know wildlife biologists that have been Tracking these cats their entire career And have only got glimpses of this elusive animal. These cats are like ghosts. They don't want us to see them, So to be able to follow the tracks Of a wild, uncollared mountain lion And have the chance to set up my camera traps And see her again, that's amazing! I'm on these tracks, and I'm following them, And they're zigging and zagging through the bushes, And then I come around the corner, And these magpies are taking off. I know right in front of me, there's something there, And it's probably a kill. This looks like a drag coming off the hill, All these tracks, nothing going that way. The kill. It's a fresh kill of a mule deer. And I literally can see my house from right here. So now the mad rush is on. I've got to go get all my cameras ready, Get them back to this kill before she returns. Man, backyard mountain lion. ♪ That night, I happened to put a camera really low, Like almost aiming straight up in the air, Hoping to get maybe a cat just like looking Over down at the camera. What I got was way more than I thought I was ever gonna get. She walks in and just steps right over the camera, And right on her belly, it was very obvious, That she had been nursing, freshly nursing, kittens. So now it's like, oh my gosh, we got this cat On camera, this is awesome, and she's got Little kittens somewhere. Just when you think this story's Not gonna get any better, bingo, we've got nursing kittens. And it's like, let's find those little guys. Let's find this family. Let's tell their story. Casey: Watching a female mountain lion feeding on a kill Just up from my house is amazing. This mule deer that she's killed Weighs probably about 200 pounds, Which is much more than she does. Mountain lions are incredible athletes. They can take down prey twice their size. But a kill like this will only feed her for a few days, Then she'll have to kill again. And she's eating not just for herself, But for her kittens as well. I don't know how many she has Or how old they are, but I'm determined to find out. She's caching the carcass in the bushes for later, So I'm hoping she's going to keep coming back, And so will I. There's still quite a bit left, The head, part of the head on that one. We might get one more night out of this. So now I'm basically taking my car batteries, Inverting it into ac power so I can run Some of these lights. I'll slip out of here and go see what we got. The next night, she doesn't disappoint. But this time, she's not alone. Three kittens. ♪ Based on their size, I'm guessing the kittens Are about 2 1/2 months old. But most mountain lion cubs won't survive their first year. To have all these three survive the winter Would be against the odds. This mother's got her work cut out for her, And she'll keep those kittens close to her. When they're mothers, they only have a range Of about 10 square miles. So for me, this is a great opportunity To watch these kittens grow. When she finally decided to bring the kittens To the kill for the very first time, It was really obvious, from the start, That they each had their own little personalities. You could see right away that there was Like this big mean one, and we started Calling it meany. [kitten growling] Eenie was the little one. She was always kind of the adventurer, Off on her own, doing her own thing. Then we started going eenie, meenie, miney, And that fit pretty good, actually. Because there was miney, who was always The possessive one. Everything was mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, And then mama mo just fit, you know? Eenie, meenie, miney and mama mo. That's how I named her mama mo. ♪ This place is harsh. The winds can blow 60 miles an hour, And temperatures can drop down to 50 below zero. Blizzards are unpredictable, And, in a matter of minutes, you can be lost In a complete white out. Not the best conditions to have three kittens. But as I begin to track mama mo, I quickly realize that she was an extraordinary mother. Most of the animals in this part of the country Have evolved to sync the birth of their Young with warmer weather and spring conditions. While the winter setting might seem Like a death sentence for these little kittens, It's really the opposite. The frigid cold actually drives the prey From the high country down into the valley below. And that means mama mo doesn't have to go very far. It's like having a buffet right at her front door. So winter is when a mountain lion thrives. But for me to try to follow her and film her, Man, it gets cold. There is one advantage for it being so cold, though. Her warm body really sticks out When I'm using thermal imaging technology. With this technology, the invisible becomes trackable. So these are military grade thermal binoculars That sense heat, so basically, what you're Seeing here is just a heat gradient. It'd look exactly the same day or night. You're not seeing, really, visible light. You're seeing that the tree's a little bit Warmer than the ground, so white is hotter than black. We're looking for bright white. That would be something giving off body heat. And then we watch it, and see how it moves, See what the general shape of it is, And then we can kind of identify what species it is. This is a game changer, 'cause day or night, We can come out with this and find animals. The fact that she does most of her moving around Either in low light or no light situations, This is the only way that we can find her. ♪ Across the valley, up the mountain, There's just a little white light, The faintest sign of body heat. And when I check it out a little bit closer, Bingo, there she is. Finding that cave was huge. I mean, it gave me such an incredible opportunity To set up cameras and film them up close, Without being intrusive. It was obvious she had several denning areas And caves that she would go to, But then, it was really apparent that there Was this one cave. This one cave I called the kitty condo. That's kind of her main cave. That's really her home base. She uses the other caves, but this one's her favorite You can tell. I've gone years and traveled thousands of miles Looking for mountain lions, and I've barely ever Seen one, and now, I'm filming this family every day. Mama mo has about a half dozen of these dens Scattered across the mountain. I began to start learning her patterns. Depending on where she's hunting, And where the prey is, she stashes the kittens In a den, and then heads off to get dinner. Only once she's made a kill and cached it Will she bring the kittens back to eat. ♪ When the opportunity comes, you just jump all over it. You gotta do everything you can, Do your best, not sleep most of the time, Just thinking that it might be the last Time you get a chance to look at these guys. And the way the world's changing, it might be. This might be the last time that we get To film a mountain lion family. It might be the last time anybody gets to. So the responsibility for us as story tellers Trying to protect these wonderful animals That no one knows anything about, it's now. Casey: When I first started following mama mo And the kittens, I'd never done anything like this before, At least not with a mountain lion. I'd set up camera traps on bears and wolves, But not a mountain lion, And I really worried that I would impact This little family somehow. But she was confident, and she seemed Totally unphased by it. When filming bears and wolves and other canines, I'd hide the cameras out of the way. I'd do everything I could to conceal them. With mama mo, I learned it doesn't matter. I found out there's really no way I'm Gonna hide cameras from this super-keen animal. As long as she can look at them and go, It's a camera, I don't care, She just goes in and does her thing. And she made it easy for me. She was a proficient hunter. She's making a kill, without fail, Every two to three days. When I set up on the kills, I really never Know what I'm gonna get. I just hope everything's gonna work. That's the boy there. Look at him. It's given me a glimpse into the life Of a mountain lion family, which is rarely Ever filmed, and I'm developing an understanding Of an animal that is much more than a predator. There's also this soft side to them, Where they're just a mother taking care of their babies. This is the little moments that I love. They like to have fun and play. For a mother to provide food, it's very important, But here's the other thing that this mother provides, Snuggling, loving, cleaning. When you think about a mountain lion, You don't think about this side of their life, And this is what they're doing most of the time. [laughs] sillies. Sitting here at their dinner table Allows me to see each of their personalities Really come through. Like a good mother, mama mo keeps The family clean and fed. And even looks after herself a little bit. Eenie is a miniature version of mama mo, Independent, adventurous, full of courage. And miney sticks closer to mom, Possessive of mama mo's attention. He's the biggest and only male of the kittens But a complete mama's boy. And meenie's name continues to fit perfectly. [kitten growling] She lashes out at her siblings and even mama. She's a fiesty kitten. ♪ Paradise valley has everything that mama mo And the kittens need. The snow's not very deep here in the winter, And the elk and the deer migrate here predictably. You would think that all the other predators Would follow, like the wolves and the bears, But there are also people living here, And that's what keeps the other predators away. Mama mo's made a decision to live amongst the people, Because if she can do that successfully, She can have paradise to herself. But while food is here for the taking, The pursuit of prey can lead her into harms way. And sometimes, mama mo goes hunting In an area I call the death zone. This is where humans can legally hunt mountain lions, And they often use dogs to help track them. It's illegal to hunt a mother mountain lion With kittens, but they're hardly ever With her right now. So a hunter would never know. I heard the dogs barking from the house. The way the dogs were barking, They had something in a tree. And the dogs stopped barking, So I got out and listened, 'cause that usually means a, either the cat's dead, Or b, the cat's running, and the dogs Are trying to run to keep up. Now, the fact that she's potentially moving From her sanctuary over into an area that Could be dangerous for her and her kittens, That creates worry. And, sure enough, I'm coming up the hill, I stop the truck, and here comes mama mo Running really fast right at me and goes Up into these cliffs. And right behind her, several hound dogs. [dogs barking] They get her out in the rocks, And they start to surround her. I know what's coming next. Behind the hounds it's gonna be the hunters, And I'm right there. I've gotta do something. And I just went up to them and said, "hey, this is mama mo. "she's got kittens. "this is my life. "this is what I've been waiting for all my life." And, you know, fortunately, they grabbed Their dogs and left. What if I would've not walked out the door In that moment, heard those dogs. That'd been the end of the story right there. Little did I know, the story was about to get A lot more interesting. I see in the snow, the mountain lion tracks Have crossed the road. In fact, when I look, there's two sets. Look here, mountain lion tracks with mud, A couple sets, interesting. Now, that looks like, that's our female. But look at this track. That's not our female. That's a big tom track, I think. What looks like mama mo's and a big male Walking right with her. See, here we go. There's a good comparative. That's a big track, and I don't know who this guy is. The hounds have probably got this big guy Up a tree, and as I get closer, This cat jumps out of the tree. ♪ Amazing. And, at that point, it's obvious. It's this big male. That could be bad news for mama and the kittens. Eventually, mama mo's tracks lead over the road And back home to the kittens, But now, there's this other cat lurking around her. There are a lot of risks for a mother mountain lion And her kittens, but the biggest threat to her Is actually another mountain lion. And now, that threat, it's real. This other cat is a male, and it's hanging out At mama mo's den. No matter what, I have to figure out Who this other cat is, like, what is his intention? There's only one way to find out, And that's to get a closer look. ♪ While the cat is still in the cave, I set up a camera trap right outside the entrance. Okay, okay, I'm outta here. I've got a new cat on my hands. I've got to find out what he's doing here In paradise valley. Casey: I haven't seen any sign of mama mo Or the kittens for several days. Meanwhile, a male has taken over one of her caves, So I don't know if this is a rogue male, Who could potentially kill these kittens If they're not his, or if he's actually The father of eenie, meenie and miney. I can only know what's going on by getting A camera trap up inside the den. But the risk of upsetting this feisty guy is really high. So I wait until I know he's left the cave, And then, I take my chance. I gotta hurry, set up this camera And get outta here. The last thing I want is to be wedged in this hole And that big male to come back home. Let's get this set. This looks like a real brute of a mountain lion. He's only got half of a tail, Which probably happened in one of his brawls. Male mountain lions that fight the most Actually live the longest. They're wanderers, with ranges up to 100 miles. These big guys roam across the landscape Looking for food and looking for mates. His presence has kept mama mo and the kittens Away from their den for several days. I'm excited to see this guy, But when he finally decides to leave the area, I'm sure happy to see him go. But mama mo hasn't got the message. She's still missing. And with each day that passes, her trail grows colder. All I can do is keep searching the valley And keep checking my camera traps, Hoping to get back in the tracks of mama mo. Just like an obsession or an addiction, You know, if I could spend every second Of every day following this cat around, And I could survive that way, I would do it. But the horrible days are the ones when she disappears, When you think she's gonna be there, and she's gone. And you don't know, And you think about what could have happened. Is she alive? Has the story ended? I know that day is going to come. I'm just not ready for it yet. I guess I'm in denial. Isn't that one of the indications of this addiction? See, the hunt goes on. It's been over a week since I've seen That big tom cat, and that's a good indication That he's moved on. But I haven't seen mama mo, either, And I'm starting to get worried. With both of them gone, I have the chance To get a much closer look inside her main den. Crawling in the front door of the home Of a mountain lion is not something that You get to do every day. Wow. So this is the cave mama mo basically stays Throughout the day before she goes on a hunt Down by my house. I've watched her laying up here in the sun, Just like a cat in the window sill, Amazing view, and she just waits until darkness comes. She's got the graveyard shift. She hunts on down through my yard And down to the ghost ranch. Just about the time I'm going to bed, She's going to work. I'll call it mama mo's hunting cave. This could be really warm, even in the dead of winter. Well, I'm gonna set a camera trap, And, hopefully, she'll come back, And we'll get her on film. The search continues. Still looking for mama mo. Fortunately, there are a few animals Around here who can help me. [bird screeching] Magpies are my, they're my eyes in the sky. One of the most beautiful birds, Super intelligent, corvids. Magpies can see the littlest drop of blood. They have no sense of smell. It's totally by sight, flying over the top. Most of the year, when we're looking for bears And mountain lions and wolves, it's often The magpie that points them out to us. And they're telling a story all the time. And over the years, we've just learned to listen And understand it, and it's just amazing. The birds are always telling you something. This time, they're telling me mama mo's back, Hunting in paradise valley. And with the next snowfall, I'm back on her trail. There's nothing that makes me more happy Than seeing this mountain lion's tracks. 'cause at the end of the tracks, There's always something awesome. She doesn't have any kittens with her, So she must be going back to get the kittens To feed tonight. So she must have stashed 'em last night, Went on a hunt solo. And if you put her track in a lineup With 10 other mountain lions, I've followed This little lady so much that I know That I could pick her track out of a lineup Of 10 different cats. They've very distinctive. She's got this inside toe seems a little bit Longer, just the way she steps. The story continues. ♪ Spring has sprung in paradise valley. It's amazing to watch these kittens grow. Their personalities are really showing. Meenie is constantly stalking and pouncing On her siblings, and even tackling mama mo. That mean streak of hers will probably Be her best ammunition when she finally Moves out on her own. Miney is still the biggest kitten, but he's careful. He's kind of like the mama's boy. Mama mo is still his protector. He's always right by mama's side. Hopefully, he'll find that male fighting spirit, Because that's the only way he'll make it on his own. And then there's eenie, a bit smaller than the others, She's full of spirit. She's just like mama mo. She's an adventurer. She'll jump up on any big ledge. She'll go out on her own without even looking back. She really reminds me of mama mo, Bold, confident, a perfect example Of a fearless, female mountain lion. The family is thriving, but spring is always a challenge. This is when bears emerge from hibernation, And the deer and elk are starting to spread out Across much bigger areas. The kittens are now the size Where they're learning to hunt and stalk, But with the prey dispersed, the hard time is right now. Every moment this cat is out here, There's always this constant struggle for survival. There's so many things that we probably don't See that she's dealing with all the time, And to get these three kittens to the point That they are now is an amazing feat that she's done. It's March, and eenie, meenie and miney Have turned into rambunctious five-month-old kittens. The kittens are at that age now where She's taken them through some pretty gnarly Terrain and climbing down to the cliffs. She's kind of a tough-love mom, Where she'll do what she can do physically, Like climbing down through the rocks, And let them figure it out. They can either try to follow her footsteps Or figure the way around to keep up with her, But she doesn't stop and wait for them very much. ♪ One evening, I'm watching them leave the den And head out to hunt. The kittens were following her on an adventure. Mama took a big jump down this cliff face, I'd say 30-40 feet. Meenie and miney decided they're not gonna Make that jump, so they went around. And eenie kind of looks and gets to the point Where decides to try to go mom's route, Makes a bad step and falls off this cliff Behind a tree and just disappears. It didn't look good. I knew that was gonna be a bad landing. And I didn't even know if she was gonna Come out from behind that tree. And sure enough, out comes eenie alive, But something was wrong. ♪ Casey: The injury to eenie has me really worried. She can't make it back to the den And is staying down in the valley, Where she's incredibly vulnerable. There's no way she can climb up to the cave, So mama mo has to leave her behind While she takes the other two back up to the butte. Later that night, mama mo, meenie and miney share a deer. While eenie, all alone, unable to climb the hill, Goes without the much-needed meal. Over the coming days, eenie's condition gets worse. She's not limping. She just looks really skinny still. You can see the hip bones sticking out here. You can see her rib cage really defined, Her shoulder bone sticking up here. So she doesn't have any fat on her. It really is, it's tough to watch. Then eenie disappears. I watch mama mo looking for eenie for over a week. She refuses to give up on her injured kitten. There's that motherly instinct kicking in. She's always doing her best. She's doing her best to try to find that kitten, And her instincts are good. If she's come down here and called And looked and sniffed around. She hasn't given up on that kitten. She'll look for it until there's No kitten to look for. ♪ Eventually, she finds her, hiding in a small bush. Once again, mama mo, very determined, Attempts to lead eenie back up the butte. Mom's trying to keep her going, Being patient, but also just keeping that distance And moving, trying to provoke it to keep moving. The little kitten doesn't have much energy left, And I know mama doesn't have a kill. So what mama's got to do is get that kitten Somewhere safe, make another kill And find a way to get that kitten to that food source. That's the only chance this cat's got to live. Since those kittens were born, Since the first time I've ever seen them, I've never seen her turn back for her kittens. That's just not the way of a mountain lion. The fact that she continues to turn around and wait Shows her concern and shows that she's Really trying hard to get that kitten To come up the hill. Days and then weeks go by and, somehow, Eenie is still alive. But she's progressively gotten worse. She never made it back up to the den. So mama mo has been stashing eenie right by the kills To conserve what energy the little kitten has left. ♪ Meanwhile, meenie and miney are thriving. They're growing stronger every day. It's such a stark difference between how they look And how sick and skinny their sister eenie is. Relentlessly, mama mo continues to return. She refuses to abandon her little kitten, But the odds don't look good. Super skinny, She looks pretty bad. It's been five weeks since the accident, And mama mo is out searching for eenie. Ugh, it's, There's an element of sadness just the way She's moving around. She moved the same way with the same sort of purpose Down tonight, calling, looking, sniffing. It seemed like she was searching for the sick kitten, And, now, she's returning to the cliffs, Up to the bedding area without a kitten in tow. It's really this sense that she's gone Looking for the kitten and just not finding it. There's some level of feeling tonight that maybe That kitten's not around anymore. There's definitely no pep in that step. Not looking back. She knows there's no one following her. And tonight mama mo's having a bad night. When a mountain lion goes to die, They'll find a hole or go under a bush, Just like where they cache a kill, Somewhere where no one, Not even a scavenger, will ever find them. ♪ Mama mo has lost a cub. But in nature, the cycle continues. There's no looking back. Mama mo still has two healthy, strong kittens That are now eight months old. That's a great survival rate for a mountain lion. She's done her job well. With the onset of summer, mama mo will take The kittens to higher ground, Following the elk and deer. They'll stay with her for another few months. She'll continue to teach them how to stalk, To hunt, what dangers to be wary of. And then, when they're about a year and a half old, Mama will know her work is finished, And she'll send them on their way. Hopefully, next winter, she'll come home again To paradise valley and walk across my bridge. For now, it's time to give mama mo her secret life back And let her disappear into the hills, To let her be invisible once again. ♪
