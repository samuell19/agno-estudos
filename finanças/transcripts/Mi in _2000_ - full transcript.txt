My eyes swelled. That much you care about your body, is it okay being a nude model? This job is easy to me. I wish to see you working even once. No way. Other people just watched my naked body, but you've seen my inner body. Is it like that? Why? What's up? Nothing. What the hell are you doing now? Are you death? You know it's been 3 days after the deadline? Call me. Over! Oh, you are there, master. You must not be busy. Always at home. Think it over again. Please, I feel suffocated... Please, don't leave. Please, take me with you. I must be a slut. Why? When a man's body comes into my body, I feel several guys. It is beyond me to figure out who she is. Don't go today. Why? I want to be with all day long. We can be together everyday. You hit the booze again. Come on in. What happened? What are these all about? Just fell down. Who the fuck hurt you? Please, leave me alone. What? Do I look like shit? What the hell. You mean you feel pain? I know what the hell you are thinking. Bull shit. You don't even know how much it hurts me. Fucking asshole. You love me, huh? Dumb ass motherfucker! Your eyes, when you watch me like that, fucking gross! You are saying that's love? Fucking son of a bitch! I know as much as you do. Alright. Now I don't need it. I want to die every single day. But you're not my love! Now you still think I'm your girl! Get real! You think it's so easy like that? Knock it off. Don't touch my body. Never touch me. I hate you! You are such a pain in my ass. How many times should I tell you! Stop it. I gotta go. If he comes back and beats me, I'll willingly take it. That's my love. Don't ever touch me. I'm going there again. That's enough. My love is only one guy! Only he is my love! Alright. Don't play with love stuff! Don't do that. Please, don't. Please, don't There's nothing to do with my mind come out. I rush to her aimlessly. What do you think when you watch my body? It varies in every aspect. How about today? I mean now? I'm hungry for your body. You want to taste? Then eat me up. Gosh! That hurts. That hurts me. Really? That hurts. Look it. I'm glad that someone loves my body. We are not here. Speak to it. Speak what? Speak anything. Whatever you feel like to speak now. This is an invisible picture. A commemorative picture. Fill this with the happiest moment. Hmm. I... Where is it? Where is it? Where did it have gone? Here it is! Hold on there! My pussy hurts. Why? I don't know. Maybe we did it too much. Then, let's stop doing it. No way. I wish to fall asleep at this moment. Hello. Yeah? Death? Who's death? When? No way. That can't be happened. How come? How come he's death? To bear it alone, I write about love. Bearing the absence of you This is nothing but a lapse of memory. For love, I am rather a person with skin stripped off than a person with feathers. Have you ever been happy until now? Happy? Let's see. When was it? Hardly ever was I happy. Not even once? Why are you asking me like that? I'm happy. If I got hots for someone... I missed you. But you always leave me. I wish this would be the last moment. I love you. How dreadful the love is. So dreadful that I can't find from where to be surprised. Right from there is the starting point of my writing. She came back. Ripped by: SkyFury
