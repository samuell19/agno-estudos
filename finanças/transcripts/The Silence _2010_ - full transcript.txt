July 8th, 1986 I got a question. Don't be afraid. Sorry. I'm sorry. Oh my God. Shit! Timo. Fuck, fuck, fuck. Oh my God. Help me. Help me. Toss 'em out. Toss 'em out! 23 YEARS LATER FRIDAY Sinikka, open the door. - How many times do I have to say it? Don't lie to us. - I didn't play hookie. What about the letter? - They're lying at school. Oh, the school's lying now? Open up. Where are you going now? - To tennis practice. No way. You're staying here. - Are you going to drive me? No, I'm not. - And why not? I still have work to do, and we're not done talking about this. It's all crap. - Yes, it's all crap. Fuck off. She said "Fuck off." Marie? No, my parents are hassling me. Really? Phillip's coming, too? Come on! David! So you did get my invite. Oh, good. Here. I brought this. Thanks. David. David. It's nice to have you here. - Hi. - Hi. Wow. - Yes. David, come with me. There's some disgusting potato salad. Here. What was that about? He's David Jahn. He lost his wife to cancer. Well, guys. Let's have another one. We won't be this young again. Elena, come inside. Great. We're running out of red wine. Come on. It's me. I'm sorry about before. I'll sleep at Marie's. We'll be at the lake tomorrow. I'll be back in the afternoon. Don't worry about me, and don't be mad at me. I love you both. Stop it... Stop. A speech! No, it's nonsense. I'm much too drunk. Would you stop it. That's just an excuse. You have to. You have to. After 44 years... After 44 years it came to an end before it could really get started, but that's how it is with the police. I'm happy to be back... - What? I'm happy to be back. I'm fit for service. I requested to have the new system put on the computers. It's such a mess. - Good luck. I tried to do the same thing last year. - They'll listen to me. Sure they will. They always listen to assholes. I always knew you thought that. I know you didn't want me to get promoted. Then whine about it. Know what? It's no wonder that your son is in the nuthouse, with a father like you. You stupid idiot! Get out! Get out, you... Asshole! Fucking asshole! She's really starting to get to me. One day she's really nice the next she's a pain in the ass. Elke's only eleven. We weren't any different either. Maybe, but that doesn't change the fact that I think our daughter is a total pain now. Cheers. Do you have children? - I had a daughter once. I'm sorry. I didn't know. She was murdered. A long time ago. She was eleven when it happened and a real pain in the ass. I'm not in. - What's going on with her? I'll call Marie. What's her name? - Oh, just let her have some fun. Nonsense. - You'd have hated it if your father called. Marie, call me. Where are you guys? Jeez, this is total crap. I'll head home then. Great. Damn, it's gotta be here somewhere. Jeez, I wanted to show it to you before I go. That damn case cost me my marriage. They just threw it away! Pigsty! Is this it? Yes, that's it. Her name was Pia. She was only 11. She was raped and murdered in a field, close to where she lived. We found the body much later, in a lake. We never caught the killer. A boy saw a red car there that day, which we never found, of course. No idea if there was a connection. The body had been in the water too long by the time we found it in the lake. I had to break it to her mother. July 8th. Yeah. - Today's the 8th. You're right. Is everything alright? - Everything's fine. Sorry. Keep sleeping. It took a long time today. Did you visit your lover again? No, not today. I've got a surprise for Malte. What is it? You'll see tomorrow. SATURDAY Jana. It's not a problem. What is it? Thank you for contacting us right away. If we have any more questions, I'll give you a call. You live right up there, don't you? I'll stop by. Here's my boss. Thank you. What's he doing here? He's the only one I could get hold of. - Oh great. What have you got so far? Not much. A farmer found a bike. It's over there. Next to it was a gym bag. Where David is we found a bloody rock and a tuft of hair. Good morning. - Good morning A girl was murdered here once before. Yes, I know that already. Okay. Nonsense. Why does the same thing happen again in the same spot after so many years? It has to be a coincidence. Sinikka's not picking up. - She's probably still sleeping. Karl. Yeah. Nothing. Attack! - I need help. Help! Help! Put him down. - Put him down. - No. No. - Put him down. Okay, there you go. So, what's the score? - They're playing like crap. Exactly, 23 years ago, on July 8th, 1986, the 11-year old Pia was raped and murdered in this field. Back then, a boy saw a red car, but the killer was never caught. Today, police found a girl's bike and a gym bag in the same spot. Traces of blood suggest violence. The cases are bizarrely similar. Then, too, there was initially no victim. Only weeks after the murder, the girl's body was found in a lake. The killer was never caught. Yet the police stated it is still a missing persons case. If you have any clues, please report it to your local police. I need something to drink. Does it hurt a lot? I'll be right out. Okay. No I just thought it could be... That it could help us out somehow. Yes. Maybe it'll help us to identify it faster. No, I didn't think about that. Damn. Nothing. We can't find anything here. Well, then keep looking. Shit. What are we doing here anyway? Just because she was sunk here. A bunch of kids are messing around with us and laughing behind our backs. Maybe Krischan could help us. Forget that old fogie. We found her. What? Where? - I mean We know who she is. The father called us. and identified the bike. - And what did you arrange with him? That you'll come by later. Oh, shit. I hate that. I'll do it. What was the girl's name? Sinikka Weghamm. Okay. See you later. Hello, Krischan. - Hello. Anything new? Unfortunately, no. Krischan, I know it's idiotic but I can't let you through. No civilians. - Stop your nonsense. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. On Grimmer's orders. I'm sure it'll just be something silly. It happens often enough. One minute they're gone, and then the next, they're standing on the doorstep in the morning. Do you fight very often? How about a boyfriend? Someone you didn't know at all, one she could've run off with? Yes, well. I think it'd be best if you would wait here at home until she turns up again. She'll come home again. - Don't fuck with us! I know it's difficult for you. We can also provide psychological support, if you'd like. It's important that you remain calm. Is everything alright? Yes, everything's alright. It was nice today. - Yeah. I'm feeling a bit queasy. I'll get you some water. It's pretty hot today. Are you doing math? I've got an exam tomorrow. - I was bad in math. Me, too. You're the caretaker here, right? - Yes. Peer Sommer, summer like winter. But just call me Peer. - Okay. But you're not from around here. - No, I'm from Denmark. Eight years ago I moved here. - Ah. I'm Timo by the way. Hello, Timo. - Hi. SUNDAY Hey, stop it! Stop! - Daddy! Stop it! Stop! HOME I'll get it. Yes. Hi, Georg. It's me. I'm under the weather. No, I've got a bout of the flu. No. I think I'll stay home tomorrow. I... Yes, thanks. Okay. Bye. It was Georg. there are problems at the site. I gotta go. Daddy, you promised we'd play a game tonight. I'm sorry. I won't be long. I promise. We can play it another time. - No! Malte, I'm sorry. Go on. Okay. Bye, honey. - Not so hard. I'll be back tomorrow, at the latest. It'll be alright. We'll play something else. Mrs. Lange, we met back then. On your daughter's case. I'm Krischan Mittich. I was the detective. Can we talk for a minute? Could I come in for a minute? Thank you. Everything's alright. I... There was a spider. I just don't know, sometimes... Sometimes I'm overcome by it and... - I'm sorry. I'm... I'm bad with things like that. I'm the wrong one for that. You should maybe look for someone who can help. A professional. This was lying on my desk. Maybe you could look through it again. Maybe you should knock off earlier today. They say Sinikka will show up again. Nonsense. It's exactly like it was back then. Everything. - Yes. But why? Yes. I'm Karl Weghamm again. I wanted to see if there's anything new. Can I speak to Mr. Grimmer please? Or Mr. Jahn? Yes, thanks. Assholes. Jeez, let it be. Sinikka has a hair appointment tomorrow. I hope I can still cancel it. Where are you going now? They said we have to wait here. Hello, David. So? Anything new? - No. Alright, Mrs. Lange. Thanks. I'll be in touch. Screw off, you assholes! Or I'll call the police! Get out of here! I'm David Jahn. I'm with the police. Do you have a minute? Do you know why Pia was laughing like that? No clue. My ex-husband took it. No one ever asked that before. They only call her Sinikka on TV. It was the same with Pia, too. Weghamm. Her name is Sinikka Weghamm. Are you going to catch him this time, or will he get away again? I always wanted to know what he looked like. I've got a question. I'm not sure if it's appropriate now, but... Your daughter has been gone now for 23 years. And yet you still live in this house, in this room, with all these things, as if it was only yesterday. I don't know what I'm... It's been five months since my wife... I haven't cried since then. It's not normal, is it? You want to know why I still live here, right? Like this. I don't know. Not in. Sinikka! When you hear this call me! We are so worried. If you're mad at me, then... I'm sorry. Please. Please come home. Hello. Hello. Hello. Say something. Talk to me. Please. David! Come on, open up! David! David! - Yes. Finally. I've got something for you. Here. I just took it home with me back then. This. But I overlooked something then. I don't know what. But I overlooked something. It's the same guy. I'm sure of it. You have to help me. Krischan, we don't even have a body yet. Don't delude yourself. She's dead. She's only missing. All of you have written her off already, haven't you? And if she's alive? Back then we said she was just missing, too. Sinikka is dead. Her body is out there somewhere. It's just a question of when you find her. Come on. I can't do it alone. Please. I need you. He can't get away this time. Not this time. By the way, how was the exam? Complete failure. Better luck next time. Math's not really my thing. I told you so. Do you like the girl from the 7th floor? What girl? The one in the green bathing suit. The one you were watching by the pool. That's not true. Oh, I just thought that... How long have you had it? Had what? I see it in the way you look sometimes. I thought I knew that look. I've got some movies if you want to watch them. Hey, are you nuts? Timo, I'm sorry. MONDAY Why didn't you drive her to tennis practice? Mr. Mittich. No, you're not interrupting. What? What did... What did you say? No. No, not at all. I don't want that. No, I don't want that. When? I don't get it. It can't be like that. She has to be somewhere. What do we tell the parents? That we're making progress slowly. Officially she's still missing because we don't have the body. We're going strictly by the book. And we're not going to go crazy here. They?re going to have to be patient. Well, maybe we do have something. I don't know if it'll help any, but... Martina Beneck disappeared on May 8th, 1982, on her way home from school. And in this case too, someone spotted a red car near the scene. The witness couldn't remember the make anymore. Great. How does that help me? They generated a list of red cars back then. There were 500 on it. 500? - Yes, maybe even more. Wait, I've got... I've got a list from 1986. The one in Pia's case. They questioned all the owners. Negative. There were too many. If we compared the names from both lists, and just mark the cars that are on both, then... Excuse me, but where'd you get that? From Krischan. How come you have that from Krischan? Should I get started on it or not? It's nothing but a waste of time. Yes, fine. Then get started. Have fun. It'll keep you busy until next week. Hello. Timo. Hello. Jeez. Wow, it's really been a long time. I was just... What a big surprise. Want something to drink? Yeah? Come on, let's go get a drink. Come on. Here you are. Well, just like it used to be. It's really great to see you again. How are you? Why did you do it? Why did I do what? With the girl? The one who's missing. Well. I didn't do it. Honestly. Just like back then. It must be a coincidence. How many girls since then... Did you leave Denmark because of it? - Hey, Timo. It's nonsense. It was a one-time thing back then. Why would I do that again? I often thought of you. You know, you just disappeared. I was worried about you. I looked all over for you. You weren't in the telephone book or anywhere. I had always hoped that you would stop by one day. Hey, say something. Do you have a family now? I'm leaving. Why? Stay. Timo. Wait. I have something for you. Your favourite movie. I recorded it. The dark-haired girl. Stop by again tomorrow. I don't know anymore. I've already told you. It was around 10 p.m. We have to be absolutely certain. That's why I keep asking. - After four months you forget things! I can't take your endless questions. You say our daughter is just missing. But no one says what's really going on. Tell us where she is. What about the red car? Why can't you find it? Please welcome the mother of the young Pia, who was murdered 23 years ago, and the officer who was in charge of the investigation. Hello. 23 years ago, the 11-year old Pia was violently killed on her way home. No, I just saw the car. It just stopped a minute. Then it drove off, and he threw something out of the window. Yes, the headphones. Are you sure you didn't see who it was? Can you tell me the make of the car? A Mercedes, a BMW? What did it look like? David! - It was red. Yes, you said that. - Krischan's on TV. You gotta see it. Together with her. Come on! Quickly! They found the body in a lake a few days later. And now another girl, nearly a quarter of a century later. Is it a coincidence? - No. It's the same perpetrator. It's the same pattern. What is that idiot thinking? - The perpetrator assumed... He's interfering with an investigation! Ever heard of protecting the relatives? But... - That fool! Did you know about it? - ... talk of a missing girl. ... lied to the parents and raised their hopes by claiming she's just missing. But... - The girl is dead. No one has the courage to say it. Mrs. Lange, how do you as a mother deal with the loss. - I can't do this. Mrs. Lange. - I'm sorry. I can't do this. - If the perpetrator is watching this, I'd like to tell him: Give up and turn yourself in. - Asshole! We don't even have a body. Turn that crap off. Dear guests, dear viewers, anyone who has a child can certainly imagine how terrible it must be to live with this uncertainty... Hi, it's me. I was watching TV, and there was something on that missing girl. This woman made me sad somehow. I've tried to reach you all day. Call me back, even if it's late. Pardon. I'm sorry. It... - What the... Was it your idea, you asshole? We sit around all day waiting for someone to call us. Nothing. Nothing at all. You pretend you're looking for her, but do nothing. We hear on TV that our daughter is dead. You know what that's like? - Calm down. I don't want to calm down anymore. - Mr. Weghamm. Mr. Weghamm, it was... TUESDAY I'm going to the office. Do you live here? I used to. Over there. I live there. Wanna see who can swing higher? Come on, faster. Please, Mr. Sommer. Would you finally take care of the squeaky swing? It's a nuisance. Yes, I'll get it. Have a nice day. Hello, Timo. It's nice to see you again. I just went to the store. Want to have a bite, too? We could watch a movie later, or do whatever you want. - I want to watch a movie, too. Wait until you're older. Let's go. Come on in. Come on. Come on. Timo. Wait! Timo! I know it's a long-shot, but I don't want to find out later that the killer was on these lists. We've put an X before all cars that are on the lists from both '82 and '86. We're only left with 104 names, and just 78 are men. And 12 are dead, thank goodness. There are still 66 left. I want results by this evening. We can manage without you. Go home and take a shower. You're an eyesore. Good luck. To hell with Grimmer. We can go together, too. Come on. I'm supposed to take a shower. Let's go. Come on. Come on now. It's me. I'm sorry about before. I'll sleep at Marie's. We'll be at the lake tomorrow. I'll be back in the afternoon. Don't worry about me, and don't be mad at me. I love you both. Good morning. Are you with the police? Have you found the girl already? They've removed everything from here. Your people questioned us already, but we didn't notice anything. We live back there. Next to Mrs. Lange. - Yes. Pia's mother. The poor thing has to relive it all. - Come on. Let's go. Have a nice day. Hi there. Sorry to bother you. I... Do you happen to know if the house next door is up for sale? I was just thinking. It looks like it's empty. Have you lived here long? Yes. - My wife and I want to move here. But we aren't sure whether it's okay for our kids or not. Would you like to step in for a minute? Sure. - After you. May I? There you are. Very kind of you. Is that your daughter? I have two children, too. Mine are 6 and 13. A boy and a girl. Malte and Laura. What's your daughter's name? It's a beautiful name. So you're looking for a house in the neighbourhood? Yes. I'm changing jobs. Do you know if anyone is planning on moving away? But I could ask around, if you want. Yes, that would be nice. The cake is wonderful. Thanks. I'll leave my card here. If you find out anything, my address is on there, too. Does your daughter... I was thinking that my son might be the same age as your daughter's children. My daughter doesn't have any children. She's dead. I'm so sorry. It was a long time ago. Still, I'm sorry. I... I didn't mean to... You've got my card. I... I think I should go. I'm really sorry about your daughter. I'll show you to the door. Hopefully we'll have more luck here. Jana. About yesterday... - Why? Was there something yesterday? I can't believe it. It must be a joke. Who's the next one? Sommer, Peer Sommer. Oh, there you are. Where are you going? Say something. I'm sorry. Sorry. It was a madhouse in town. You were right. He was here. And if he's not home either, I'm going to go crazy? - Yes? What? No. Wait. I'll pick you up. No, I'll pick you up. Okay? Yes. See you soon. Bye. What is it? I have to go. I have to go. And what about the list? And how am I supposed to get home? Take the bus. There's a bus stop over there. Damn it! Shit! Let me see. I'll take you inside. Hello, Mr. Sommer? Mr. Peer Sommer? - That's me. Sommer like winter. Great. I'm Jana Gl?ser. I'm with the police. I'd like to ask you a few questions. Can I step in for a minute? Yes, of course. Come in. - Thank you. Hello. Yes. - Finally! I've been trying for two days. Where have you been? Problems with the foundation. It might take a while yet. - A while? I don't get it. What's up with you? In case you care, Malte hurt himself. That damn trampoline broke in half. I said from the very beginning it was a stupid idea. It doesn't matter. When are you coming home? I don't know. Tonight. - Why not earlier? Where are you? - I'm at a lake. At a lake? I thought you were at the site. Can I talk to Laura and Malte, please? Laura isn't here, and Malte's playing outside. Someone's at the door. I gotta go. See you tonight, or not. Hello, Mrs. Friedrich. I'm David Jahn. This is Krischan Mittich, We're with the police. Anything happened to my daughter? - No. We're investigating a missing persons case and are looking for some clues. Come inside. Here you are. - Thanks. Help yourself. They are homemade. Tasty. I need to question you, if it's alright. - Well, if I can be of assistance. We're investigating clues leading to a red car. And you owned one from '82 to '86. Is that right? Yes, I had a red Audi back then. I bought it in '78 when I moved here from Denmark. Unfortunately I had to junk it. When? Yeah, when? It was in the summer of '86. What make of car do you drive now? I don't have a car. Too expensive. I ride my bike. It's healthier. If I may ask, why? Why do you think? Why... No clue. What do you do? I've been the caretaker here for more than 30 years. Fine. Then you've heard about the case of the missing girl. Sinikka. - Yes. Terrible thing. Terrible. Could you tell me where you were last Friday? Between noon and midnight. Sure. I need to get something. Mrs. Friedrich, we wanted to question your husband. - He's not home? No. He's gone on business. He's an architect. He has things to attend to at one of his sites. - In a hotel? Do you have the address? Yes, he's in a hotel but I don't know which one. When do you expect him back? - Tonight. For supper. Don't worry about it. We just need a few answers. Could I use your bathroom? Left, next to the front door. - Thanks. That's my husband's card. Where did you get it? I mean what's this all about? It's difficult to explain. Excuse me. I mowed the lawn from 10 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. It always takes that long. I was at Maria's at 1 p.m. and fixed her TV. I don't have to, but I enjoy doing it. Then I oiled a swing, went shopping, cooked. I was busy the whole day until 7 p.m., then had supper here by myself, and watched DVDs until midnight. Could I see that? Yes. - Thanks. Your husband, did he live in Walsen years ago, by chance? Like in the '80s? - Yes he studied there. Math. Then he quit school and moved here. His last name wasn't Friedrich then. My husband took on my last name because it sounded nicer. He didn't want to keep his former name. Do you know when he moved here? Yes, in the summer of '86. We met then and got married right away. Where's your partner? Oh, I've been doing that for years to know where I was and what I was doing. Thanks. Alright. I'll be on my way. Okay. What are you doing here? This must be Daddy's little office, huh? Excuse me? The computer is full of that stuff. Turn the computer off. Turn it off. Where is your husband? Where is he? I don't know. At some lake. I don't... No one is to touch this computer. Understood? I'm sorry. And thanks a lot for the iced tea. It saved my day, really. Of course. If I have any more questions, I'll call. Can I reach you here? Yes, of course. - Good. Well then, bye. - Goodbye. Yes, Gl?ser. What? We've got him? Where? Okay, fine. I'm on my way. Oh, no. Dammit. You have to pick me up, please. Okay, I'll take a cab. Very funny. David! Police assume that the suspected killer committed suicide. His DNA was found on the headphones of Pia, murdered in 1986. Police assume that in addition to Pia and Sinikka, he killed yet another girl. The the 12-year-old Martina B. has been missing since 1982. Sinikka still hasn't been found. WEDNESDAY They're examining the movies on his computer right now. The laptop is trashed. It doesn't matter. The DVD is enough for me. And the lists with the red cars? Nothing. I saw him in our parking lot. What? Timo Friedrich. He was here. Maybe he wanted to turn himself in. We've got a press conference at 11 a.m. to inform the public. Be happy! Mr. Grimmer! - Yes! Mr. Grimmer! Spit it out, Lenz. - Sinikka. Someone found her body. Niko died. I think he died of thirst. Do you want some tea, too? If you want we could get away for a few days. I've got friends on Lake Garda. They've got a cottage there. I could call. What do you think? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to... We could just stay here, too. I mean... I talk too much, far too much. This here. It's not working out. August 13, 1986. ... and then he threw something out of the window. - Yes, the headphones. Are you sure you didn't see who it was? ... and he threw something out of the window. - Yes, the headphones. Are you sure you didn't see who it was? Can you tell me the make of a car? A Mercedes? HEADPHONES A BMW? What did it look like? It was red. - Yes, you said that. There were two people. You're still here? - We were wrong. There were two people. What do you mean? - The boy said the killer threw something out of the window. Yes, the headphones. - Yes. He saw the car facing this way, to the north. But the headphones were here, on the right side. So what? If the killer drove north, then he was sitting there. On the left. He would have thrown the headphones to the left. But he was on the passenger side. Someone was on the passenger side. The gust from the car would have blown the headphones over to the other side. What do you mean "gust"? - Yes. They started the car. There was no gust. - It's nothing but... The boy was here. He could only have seen the passenger. There was another man in the car. Excuse me, but it's nothing but an idiotic theory. The guy had a DVD of Martina in his car and tons of child porn on his computer. Just put two and two together. There were two. Yeah, maybe even five. As many as can fit in the car. - I just know it. There were two men. One is still out there. Come on, David. That's ridiculous. We've turned the case over already. Mr. Vogt from HQ is examining it now. He'll come to the same conclusion as I. The jerk changed his name, shortly after Pia was murdered, So he wouldn't be found. What about the traces of sperm on Sinikka? - None. No indication of rape. No indication of... No rape? Then explain something to me. Why does a pedophile kill a girl without raping her first? It makes no sense. Unless he wanted to send a message. What if... What if the crime here, our murder, wasn't perpetrated by a pedophile but by a desperate, lonely person. And pedophiles are lonely. They committed the crime together in 1986. But then Timo Friedrich disappeared, without a trace. He left Walsen. He got married, started a family, and even changed his name. And now this guy has been looking for him desperately. 23 years without success. What does he do? He recreates the crime right down to the smallest detail. The only person who can interpret this message is Timo Friedrich. He sees it on TV, gets in his car, and follows his trail That's bullshit. Timo Friedrich did it by himself. We even found his DNA on the goddamn headphones! Bullshit! Of course you found his DNA on them. He threw them out of the window. He was sitting in the passenger seat. Besides, Timo Friedrich didn't have a red car. So what? It's inconsequential. Maybe he borrowed the car. Maybe it wasn't even a red car. Jeez, a boy made that statement 23 years ago. Maybe he mixed up north and south. Then why did Timo Friedrich commit suicide? Remorse. Remorse. For once, we agree. But after 23 years? And just before doing so, he kills a girl? Just because? And he recreates everything? Who was he trying to reach out to? David, you're interpreting too much into it. What message? Do you want me to tell you what the fucking message is? He wanted to kill her. Nothing more. - That's bullshit! David. David, you're just tired. Believe me. I know how you feel now. Shut your mouth. Shut your fucking mouth. And now you shut your mouth, I happen to be your fucking boss. And we just had a press conference in there. The case is closed. Period. You smug little asshole! Stop it! David! - Would you all just leave me alone! Would you all just leave me alone! Alright, go home and finish grieving for your wife. Until then you're no use for us here. You're suspended. Okay? - Alright. It'll be alright. We've found the right one. There were two guys. We found Sinikka. I had to break it to her parents. My wife... Every second... Every hour, actually always. When does it stop? Never. Did he do it? Mr. Sommer, I'm glad you oiled the swing. It's very quiet now. - My pleasure. Your car keys. Thanks again. - Don't mention it. Do you need it next week again? - No. MAIN SUSPECT COMMITS SUICIDE The man killed himself. A father of two children. Is everything alright? There was a man with you recently. Was he a relative? A friend. I hadn't seen him in ages. I had sent him a message. Did he get it? THE SILENCE
