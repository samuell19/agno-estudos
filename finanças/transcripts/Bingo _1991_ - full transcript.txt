WOMAN 2: Bingo, how's it going? Lovely color. Right? And a touch of pink. Absolutely smashing. And the way that outfit sets off your eyes, now hold still, please. I'm not finished. You good-for-nothing, flea-ridden, worm-carrying cyst! Look what you've done. Oh, you're hopeless. Remember this? You want to go back in this? In the river, where I found you. GINGER: Steve. Something's wrong with Lauren. No wonder. Look at the size of that thing! Tenpenny. Has Lauren been hanging around the swami again? Rhamjani. When-- when I get my hands on that guy, I'm going to hammer him to that stinking bed of his. Slow down, Steve. Lauren will be okay. I'll just give her something for the infection, and she'll be ready to go in a couple of days. Couple of days? I-I-I've got network people coming. Program development. They're looking for a dog- and-pony show for prime time. Fine, just use two dogs and a pony. Oh, without Lauren, we're dead. Steve, look. Why not use Bingo? Bingo.

So he's not a circus dog, Steve. Is that a crime? He just needs a family that loves and cares for him. A little boy to play frisbee with. Frisbee? Yeah. The only thing that dog's gonna catch is a bullet. No, run, Bingo! Run for cover. No, Bingo. Not "covers." Escape! Run for freedom. Do whatever makes you happiest. Not "playful" happy.

Do you want him hanging around all day? He's your brother. Bingo. Come on over here. That's it. Don't be shy. That a girl. Oh, a boy. Heh, heh, sorry. No offense.

Move over, Bingo! I'm coming up. More, Chuckie? I mean, chicken, Chuck? No, chicken, chick. Chicken, Chickie. There! Well, I'm worried, Hal. It's not like Chuckie to be late for dinner. He's just manipulating us again! Manipulating us? How? May I be excused? Because he knows we'll be worried. Then why should I pretend I'm not worried if he's thinking I'm worried anyway, since he's not here to see me pretending I'm not worried? CHICKIE: Please may I be excused? What do you have to make everything so difficult for, Natalie? He'll show up. And if he's locked himself inside the pet store again? Simple. We leave him there. No, no, no, I will not be sandbagged on this! CHICKIE: I'm done, okay? I hate animals! And he knows that. Can I please go upstairs? All right. I don't need that attitude, okay? I've had a very tough day. Listen, buster, just lay off him, okay? He's not the one who's missed all the field goals lately. Oh, great, great, huh, great. First the coach, now it's you! It just doesn't feel right. It hasn't since Buffalo. Hal, Hal! For god's sake, leave your foot on the floor and the game in the stadium. Right now, I'm worried about our son.

There. 7:14, sunrise. I'll call. Hal, Hal, it's Chuckie, it's Chuckie! Look, right there! Right there! Oh. I told you he'd show up. I'm gonna rip his arms off. No, Hal. Remember? You said no more negative attention. How about one arm? Cool it, dude. This is no time for girls. Besides, she's way out of your league. Pedigreed purebred. Shh! Keep it down, would you? HAL: Next! NATALIE: Chickie, that's you! CHICKIE: Me? No way. I followed him yesterday. NATALIE: Right now! Go! HAL: 'Morning, son. Sleep well?

Doesn't anybody want to know where I was? Do I need to appear on a milk carton first? HAL: Finish your breakfast, Chuckie. I don't want you late for school. Take a shower first, honey. You smell like wet dog. NATALIE: Chuckie. What? Just getting the dirty laundry. About your father, sweetie, he's having a very hard time right now. CHUCKIE: Tell me about it. Regardless, it's important that you know how much he and I love you. Can you keep a secret? We were really worried about you, honey. That's off the record. I'll deny it if you tell him. But it's true. Thanks, Mom. Sweetie? Yes? Wash extra good under those arms, okay? Uh-huh. Hey, mom, did you get my bike? NATALIE: It's in the car, honey. Okay, okay. Hold your horses. I'm comin'.

Just... go to your room and pack your bags. Pack? Don't you think you're overreacting a little? Right now, young man, okay? Go on. CHICKIE: What about this bronco hat? NATALIE: Aw, chuck it, Chickie.

Now stop the damn car! You watch your mouth, young man! This is not a locker room! Speed up, dad! Ha! Go! MOTORIST 1: What are you yelling at? MOTORIST 2: What am I supposed to do about it? POLICEMAN: Shut up, all of you! I'll take care of this. Easy, pooch. Good boy. What is that? Champagne? What the... You been drinking? Okay, let me see you walk that. Uh, you seem like a nice enough pooch, so I'll let you off this time with a warning. But listen, I catch you around here again, I'm gonna run over you myself. Have a nice day. Hey, 2 minute warning, huh? Come on! I don't know why that boy can't hold it between gas stations. NATALIE: Honey, I had something in mind besides stadium food. HAL: Truckers always know the best spots to eat. You guys are going to try some good, old-fashioned roadside cuisine before it disappears forever. Two American dogs. All right. One polish-style dog. A Chinese dog for the lady. You want soy sauce on that, hon? No, thank you. That's quite a selection, huh, guys? I have to take a leak. "May I be excused?" The boy has a bladder the size of a walnut. I haven't gone once. He hasn't gone, have you? Not once. That's what he says. Have you gone? No. Guaranteed fresh, partner. Or Duke'll give your money back. HAL: Oh, so it wasn't blessed by Ronald McDonald. So what? In France, you know, they eat horses. And venison, that has kind of a gamy taste, too. Oh, it's nothing a little mustard can't fix. Thirsty, boy? Another stray? This must be your lucky day, Duke. Give him some chow, darling. Few more pounds and he'll be perfect. Get along, little doggy. Say howdy to the rest of the herd. Cocktail franks. I'm comin', I'm comin'! What the hell's the problem, Emma Lois? EMMA: He's right there! Over by the sink! DUKE: Where? I don't see anybody. EMMA: It's a roach!

Hup, hup, hup, hike! MAN: It's only a dog. Getting a little goosy, aren't you, Lennie? Can you blame me? Okay, okay. Club him, and let's get some sleep. Club him? He's not a harp seal. What's the matter with you? Didn't you have a dog when you were a kid? What's next? Save the whales? It wouldn't hurt you to sign a petition every once in a while. What for? We're felons! We can't vote! That doesn't mean we can't contribute in other ways. I bet you're hungry, huh, guy? Woof! He's smart, too, huh. Woof, woof! Ha-ha-ha. What's smart about waking up the whole damn countryside? Come on, we'll get you some chow, okay? Don't mind Eli. His bark's worse than his bite. That's okay. That's okay. Hup! Hup, ho! ALL: Yeah! Yeah. Three points for the big guy! Once again. Once again, yeah. Where have you been? It's your turn to snap. CHICKIE: I know. He's been leaving a piss trail for that stupid dog of his. Bite my boxers! Chuckie. Suck my socks. Chickie. Could we get on with the practice, please? NATALIE: Yes, dear, yes. Come on. I want you to put that dog out of your mind. Forget about him. Put him totally out of your mind! He doesn't have a mind. Peed his brains out. Hey, you should talk. That dog is smarter than you. In fact, he's smarter than this whole family. I've heard quite enough from you. I'm trying to concentrate. All right. You figure it out. How far do you think we've traveled by now? Sixty miles an hour, times 8, times 2, minus 42 for lunch. Okay, hundreds of miles. So what? So, pee-pee all you want, but no dog can track you that distance. Hike, already. Ugh! NATALIE: Oh, my God! HAL: Hell, Natalie, that's a 60-yarder. Come on! Minnesota's looking hot. Oh, no, not again. Wait a second, we could double our take, if you let me put it on the Vikings against this spread. That's what you said last time, and we had to pull another job just to break even. Which is why this is perfect. It squares us. It's a 4-point spread, Lennie. Nope. On the night that we find a dog with 4 legs. No. This is a lucky dog, Len! Do what you want with your cut, but leave me out of it. Ah! Velveeta. Hey! Hey, I was going to use that for nachos. Ha. Nachos? You need chips for nachos. You got any chips, lady? That's okay. Don't worry, folks. We'll be gone right after breakfast. Forget the nachos. Let's turn in. Big day tomorrow. Come on, fella. You curl up on this. Come on. 911. What's your problem? Could you speak up? All I can hear is your dog. WOMAN: We've locked in your number and location. Are you in trouble? I think I got a prankster call from a pay phone on I-70. Hello? Hello? Get me your pencil. It's Morse code. MAN: Shh, shh, hurry up. Where are you going? ELI: I'm gonna get you. Come on. Let's go. All right, you want a piece of this? I'll give you a piece of this. Lennie! Lennie! ELI: I'll give you rough. I had the craziest dream. Let go! Get this damn dog off of me. Hey, hey! Down, boy! That's enough! I don't know which one of you started this, but you're both gonna get us in big trouble. Shitfire! They've got us surrounded. We're okay. Why do you think we got hostages? What the hell happened to them? One move, and the dog gets it! All right! That's enough! That's enough! Ow, take it easy. I'm going. FEMALE REPORTER: ...to end this terrible ordeal. And the Thompson family credits this remarkable dog with saving their lives. What are your plans now, Mr. Thompson? We still have a few days vacation left, but we're going back to dog-proof our house so we can give this little fellow the best home he's ever had. FEMALE REPORTER: And there you have it, live from the scene. Two ruthless armored-car thieves who had taken this nice family hostage, are now in custody, thanks to the extraordinary efforts of one brave dog. This is Judy Marlin, K.Y.A.P. Channel 9 News. Back to you in the studio now, Larry. NATALIE: Come on, let's go, Chuckie. We don't have all day. Bingo, I haven't forgotten you, pal. Don't give up, fella. You'll find me. Just blow off those dumb girls. What have you done with Eugene? You mean Cuddles. You can call him what you want, but his name's Eugene. Cuddles. Eugene. Cuddles. Ta-da! Not again! You know how he hates playing baby. He's my dog, too, and you don't get him all the time. You'll both have to wait to play with him. You, uh, Bingo? Woof! It's a subpoena. And do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God? Woof! DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Your honor, I object. This is a court of law, not a kennel. Overruled! Didn't you ever have a dog when you were a kid? Proceed. Thank you, your honor. Were you present on the night the Thompson camper was hijacked by two ruthless armored-car thieves who held the family captive until the following morning? And are those two thieves present in this courtroom? Would you identify them for us, please? DEFENSE ATTORNEY: That is not a legal point! LENNIE: Sit, boy, sit. Traitor. You're dog meat, pal. Get out of my face, canine! I'm going to get you, if it's the last thing I do! JUDGE: Order! Order! No further questions, your honor. The prosecution rests. The dog may be excused. Your honor, just a moment. I would like to cross-examine this witness. Get back up there, fleabag. JUDGE: The court would like to remind the witness that he is still under oath. Your honor, could we have the court reporter read back the dog's testimony in response to his whereabouts on the day in question? Ahem, ahem. Very well. Now can you tell the court where you were during the armored-car robbery earlier that day? Objection, your honor. Irrelevant. Where are you headed with this, counselor? Your honor, I have witnesses that can testify to seeing this dog near a garbage can, just before the robbery. And I would like to introduce exhibits Q and R. A fecal sample and a paw print... that will substantiate that he was at the scene of the crime. PROSECUTOR: Now wait just a minute. Isn't it true that you were the one who robbed the federal armored car? And didn't you subsequently frame my clients in a clever scheme to earn yourself wealth, respect, and a room of your own? Objection, your honor, the witness is not on trial here. Your honor, now, unless this witness can provide an alibi as to his whereabouts during the armored-car robbery he should be bound over until contrary evidence can be brought forth! This is absurd. You introduced the witness in the first place. I think we ought to hear what he has to say. Please answer the question. Do you have an alibi? Don't answer that. You have rights. Answer, or I'll throw you in the slammer for contempt. What's the matter? Cat got your tongue? Take him away. PRISONER 1: Hey, Bruno, check out the new guy. Ay, Chihuahua. PRISONER 2: That ain't no Chihuahua. PRISONER 3: Hey, short stuff. Keep your nose clean. And no chewing on the furniture. Well, this looks like my lucky day. Hey, you're really good.

All you have to do--" Lie down with dogs, and you'll wake up with fleas. You talking to me? No. We're talking to the hairwad you're with. He wants his letter back. All right, let's have the rest of it. Come and get it before it's gone. You think you're so tough. Take a bite of this! MEN: Whoa. ELI: Need a shave? Huh, huh, huh. Hey! Hey! Come on, get back! All right, who's doing all that barking, huh? Okay, that's the way you want to play it? Back to your cells. Now! Move it! Let's go! Hey, hey! What are you staring at?

What's this? A letter. You have the olfactory receptors for the transplant? They're from a Doberman. Doberman? It's the best I could do. We have no other choice. Without a transplant, his sense of smell is shot. He's overworked his own nose, and his nasal membrane looks like a worn-out shoe. No wonder he's exhausted. I just pray we're not too late. All right, knock him out, and let's slap those babies in his schnoz. Don't worry, boy. Doc's the best. Now, I just want you to count backwards, from 10. Chuckie, sweetheart, you all right? It was a nightmare, that's all. No more chain-saw videos before bedtime, okay? Okay? Okay. Lie back down, honey. Try and go back to sleep. Here's your doggy. Motel man said they're in Green Bay. It's in Wisconsin. The bus will take you there, but, then you're on your own. Find that little boy. And start your life again. I'll be fine. I, uh... I knitted you a little something. Oh, it's a tail warmer. And I packed you a few travel goodies. Dog biscuits, puzzle, magazines, cold-cream-and-jelly, your favorite. MALE ANNOUNCER: The bus for Green Bay, Wisconsin, is now departing from gate 19. Come on, let's go. You want to step to the rear? Oh, you crazy mutt! Keep your nose clean. Cold-cream-and-jelly? Well, at least he's eating something. I'm starved! Here. We're getting warmer. Damn it, Eli. I did not break out of prison to spend the rest of my life tracking that damn mutt from here to hell and gone! Forget the dog! Forget? If you put me behind bars, would I forget? Well, I guess not. Damn right! And if I put you behind bars, would you forget? No, no. No, you'd never forget. Never. If word gets out that we let a dog get away with it, we're finished! Humiliated! We are professionals! MAN: Watch your step, pal. Hind legs, too. HAL: It's never been better, Natalie. I'm telling you, from heel to toe, the foot feels lively. NATALIE: It sure does, Hal. Kick the hell out of Detroit, honey! Make those playoffs! Good luck, Dad! Here's Frisker, Mrs. Wallaby. And here's your dollar bill. Well, he's a good dog. Of course, he's not like Bingo. But then again, no dog is. Hey, you're new around here, ain't you? I don't care how pathetic you are. If you want food from old Vic, you got to earn your keep. I'll have more when you finish with these. Dave, here, will show you the ropes. Stay on your toes, Dave. This mutt looks ambitious. LENNIE: Five hundred bucks is not chicken feed. What's he talking about? If we're gonna dole money out... why don't we send something in to protect the ozone layer? That wouldn't get us the dog back, now, would it? I'm just saying, $500 is a lot for a reward. Who says we're gonna pay up? You mean we don't pay up? Lennie, we're scum. We don't have to pay up. Now quit your bellyaching. We got a lot of ground to cover. "If you have any information leading to our dog, Bingo... "Contact room 557 at the Highway Motor Inn. Ask for Mr. Smith." I've got it. Hi. Hi, uh, you Mr. Smith? Eli, is there a Mr. Smith here? We're Mr. Smith. Um, I think the dog you're looking for is working down at Vic's Cafe as the assistant dishwasher. Assistant dishwasher? You sure? Well, he hasn't been promoted yet. Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey! What about my reward, huh? Oh, uh, sell Old Blue. What's going on here? Wanna buy a dog? Yeah, you're a hard worker, Bingo.

Him and who else? How about the offensive line of the Green Bay Packers? What is Daddy? President of the Booster Club? Try Hal Devlin. Hal? Oh, Hal! Devlin, Devlin, Devlin, Hal Devlin, the place kicker Devlin? He stunk up the Denver stadium. Cost me some big dollars. Well, he's 8 for 8 with Green Bay.

Oh, my boy! My boy! ELI: Lennie, it ain't gambling when you mark the deck. LENNIE: I don't get it. What does football have to do with poker? ELI: Nothing. It's a metaphor. LENNIE: A what? ELI: All right, never mind. Look, here is your suitcase. Here is your tape! Here are your wires! This is your timer, right? Right. What is this? LENNIE: A screwdriver. ELI: Okay, good. Now you got all the explosives you need to do your job. Now just let me do mine! LENNIE: Yeah, but Eli, everything we have on one game? You don't understand, because you are a technocrat. You build devices. You work with your hands. I, on the other hand, am a visionary. I work with my mouth. Now, I got to find a phone and get the ball rolling on this thing before kickoff. But, Eli-- Lennie! You just worry about the kid and rigging the device. If this plan doesn't work, the next one I wire to your shorts, partner. Visionary, huh? Bingo! Go to my house. Get somebody. Now! Now! What's going on in here? Shut up! Shut up! I hate that song. Who are you? What? No, no, no. We don't want any. No, no, no! Go away. Goodbye. Go away. Goodbye. ANNOUNCER: Welcome to the Pontiac Silverdome. We got a capacity crowd on hand to watch the Green Bay Packers battle the division-leading Detroit Lions. At stake... Where'd you get this? Just a sec. Who was that at the door, honey? A dog with a hat. Looks like Chuckie's. Don't be silly. Do you know how many Packer caps there are in this town? Huh? Excu-- Excuse-- Just a moment, please. Hold on. Uh, Chickie, could you please get that? You know what? I'm having difficulty understanding you. NATALIE: What? What's that? I said... "We've got your kid, lady." You again? Get out of here before I call animal control. What's wrong, Mom? You look like you've seen a ghost. Who was that at the door? Uh, it was that dumb dog again. The dog, the dog! Mom! Wait! PLAYER: Hut, hut, hut! Devlin! For you. Yeah. What? I-- I-I told you never to call me here. What are you doing? Hal, they've got Chuckie. HAL: What? Who's got Chuckie? Kidnappers. Kidnappers, they said that if we want to see him alive again, we-- You pay them. You understand? You pay them. He's our son, for God's sake, we'll pay anything. NATALIE: It's not exactly that kind of ransom. They uh, they want you to miss all your field goals. What? Don't make any field goals against the Tigers. The lions. Detroit. Whatever, Hal. They're serious. Please! You call the police and you-- No, I can't do that. What? Tough to hear. I can't call police. They said not to call the police, Hal. Can-- Say again, please. They said no police. They're serious, Hal! How can you be sure? Because a dog dropped off some of Chuckie's clothes. They've got a dog working for them? Apparently. What the-- Chickie's out trying to track him down now. Oh, Hal, what are we going to do? I got to go! Look, just do what you think is best. It's probably just a whole, stinking-- Chuckie's our son, Hal. Look, I got to go. There you are. Everything okay, Devlin? Oh, yes, sir. Just, uh, a little, uh, little pep talk from the wife. That's the ticket! Yeah. Hey coach, you got a minute? Tell me, what's more important to you? Family or football? Are you kidding? Football's my life! That's what I thought. ANNOUNCER: And with less than a minute to go in the 3rd quarter, Devlin will try a 32-yard field goal that could put the Packers ahead. There's the snap, the kick is up, and it is wide! Oh, hell! Oh, he's done it! What did I say? LENNIE: Another one? ELI: Shh! ELI: Ow! Oh, God! LENNIE: All right, I got him, I got him! I got him, Eli. I got him. No! Go, get off of me! I'm gonna break his legs. All right, I'll get him! Okay, I'll get him. Okay, okay! Oh, shit! Yeah! No, no! No, no! Lennie, Lennie! Get this damn dog off of me! ANNOUNCER: And so, the Packers go to Devlin again. This time, it's a chip shot from 22 yards out. His 3rd attempt of the day. The Packer fans have got to be wondering what's wrong with their field-goal ace, Gar. And there it is, Mel. The kick is up, it is-- Mom, I found him! Shh, shh, shh! Long enough. Wide left! Yes! Yes, Hal, yes! Oh, God! Mother! I found Chuckie! Oh, my God, where? He's in an old warehouse! We've got to call the police, now! Oh, no, I can't do that. I can't call the police. But we got no choice! They're gonna kill him! LENNIE: ♪ B-I ♪ ♪ G-O ♪ ♪ B-I ♪ ♪ G-O ♪ ELI: Shut up with that song! I can't get it out of my head. Boy, he really did a number on your pants. Yeah, my pants? Yeah! He almost made a meal of my nuts. Is this thing ready? I want to push the button so bad. Hey, I'm the technocrat. I push the button! Carry-on size. But, with enough wallop to level a city block. And we can activate the timer... With a simple... ...garage-door opener. ♪ There was a crook ♪ ♪ That had a bomb ♪ ♪ And ♪ Ka-blooey! Let's get out of here! God! Ah! Ow, ow! Oh, oh, ow! Oh, that mutt. Eight minutes left in the game, and then we are in fat city. Guess what? What? No, go ahead, guess. I give up! I synchronized the bomb timer... with the game clock. Lennie... I like it! Uh-oh! Hey, that's him, right down there. All right. Right there. ANNOUNCER: ...was superb! There wasn't much more he could do to... Faster, Bingo! Hurry! ANNOUNCER: Ellsworth over right tackle... And that brings up a 3rd down... Look out! ...flag on the play... I see it, I see it! Sorry! And the referee starts the clock with 4 minutes left. Detroit's gonna have to hold here... Come on, baby! Go! The Packers will be nearing field... Oh, go on! Come on, Bingo. Almost there. But hold on, the Packers quickly call for a time-out... Voila! Lennie, that's enough! Quit screwing around with that thing. Shut up and drive! It's time I had a little fun, for a change. Impressive drive, Gar. Green Bay's best today. Hey, can't you go any faster? You want me to blow the engine? You want my dad to miss another field goal? Come on! Bingo, undo me! I said it's no use. Get to the fire alarm. Over there, Bingo! Now! Go on, boy. That's it. There you go. Jump! You got to! What's wrong, boy? Jump! Jump. CHUCKIE: Jump! Eli! This is it! Stop, stop! ...this would be a good time for the free pass or draw. Cover him. They're there. The play to Shepherd in Lion territory, and the Packers stop the clock again, with 40 seconds remaining. Hey, the hell's the matter with you? We're trapped, and you're still playing with that stupid remote! You're not the boss of me! ♪ Now he's hamburger, Now's he not! ♪ ♪ Now he's hamburger, Now's he not! ♪ It's a good thing he's on artificial turf. He's gonna have to beat his personal best... SHERIFF: Let the boy go. Nobody'll get hurt. Yeah? Make sure Devlin misses this field goal, and we won't toast the kid! ...to keep his head clear. But, with stakes this high, Gar, even the most seasoned veteran gets cotton mouth and... I'll think about it! Think about it? What's to think about? What about my son? Dispatch. Patch me through to the Silverdome. Major emergency. What are-- What are you doing? First thing's first. And with the score tied, the Lions call a time-out with 34 seconds remaining. The Lions apparently want Devlin to think a bit more about his kick. Devlin! For you. Again? Yeah? This is Sheriff Clay from Green Bay. We got your boy, everything's okay. So go out there and nail this field goal for Chuckie. Give me that. You bet! Thank you, Sheriff. Come on! Hal! Hal, it's me, Natalie, Hal! Hal? Come on, lady, calm down! A lot of us have money on this game. Besides, I have it all figured out. Time's running out, copper! Now, let me see the kid first. He ain't here. Well, then where the hell is he? What's with the dog? Forget the dog, call in the paramedics. Wait! There's a suitcase in that bin. There's a bomb in it! Forget the paramedics. Call in the bomb squad. MAN: Which one is it? ANNOUNCER: Devlin's coming back onto the field. The Packers, 52 yards away from playoff berth. The Lions, moving back and forth, on the line. Hoping to rattle Devlin one more time. Are you sure it's that one? Come on, just get rid of it! That's it, Bingo, you got it! Good dog! Good dog! FIREMAN: The bomb squad's on the way. Let him go. ANNOUNCER: Devlin's ready. The kick. Up, up, up, and it's on its way. Is it long enough? NATALIE: No, no, no! No, no, no! No, don't do that. Lennie! Yes, it's good! Incredible! Hal Devlin has sent the Packers into the playoffs! Ladies and gentlemen, this game is over! Yo, kid. PARAMEDICS: Here we go. 1, 2, 3, lift. Tell the sheriff that the kid is in shock. He's on his way to the hospital. We're still looking for the dog. Since the blast, we haven't seen hide nor hair. NATALIE: Mommy's here. Hi, sunshine. HAL: Hey, partner. It's your old man. Dad? That's the boy. You know, they found that dog, son. How is Bingo? CHUCKIE: Who are all those dogs? NATALIE: They're Bingo's friends, honey. They've been here all night. Who are all these people? They all heard Bingo's story on the nightly news and wanted to wish him well. May I get you anything? I'm glad he found a family. DUKE: Carrot stick, son? Jeez, I hope your dog doesn't die. Good luck. Bingo, you got to pull through. I need you, boy! I think he's going to be just fine, Chuckie. Can I keep him, Dad? Can I? ALL: Hmm? Sure, son. Just as soon as we have him neutered.
