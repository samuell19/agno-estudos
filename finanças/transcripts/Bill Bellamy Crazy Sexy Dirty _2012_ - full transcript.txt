We're at the live taping of Crazy, Sexy, Dirty. Hi, how are you? Hey, now! Showtime at the Apollo was the first time that I was on TV as a comedian. I was the first comedian on the first show of the first night of Def Comedy Jam, which was crazy, like, I was the person who kicked off a historic event. Def Comedy Jam. Then we gonna go to Lil Wayne.. I will eat them alive. Like, I will walk through them, like... You remember Terminator? The second one with the liquid dude? Yeah, man. Go out here and say hello to the people. Let's see what they... how they feeling. I've never done this before. This is actually, like, some Elvis. Show is gonna start in about 15 minutes, people. If you have your own alcohol, drink it now. It's gonna be a great show. Crazy, Sexy, Dirty! My one hour special "Crazy, Sexy, Dirty" to me is, like, a perfect combination of who I am. It's a part of me that's just crazy and wild. Look at that skin right there. The dirty side is a part of me that most people don't know. Like, I could just really be, honest and raw about certain things. Uh, Apple Jack milk. We talk about Beyonce and Jay-Z. Coming to the stage, man. Y'all seen this brother on everything, man. He's one of the most phenomenal comics in the country. I need y'all to get on y'all feet for Bill Bellamy! Yeah! How y'all feeling? Break it down, break it down, break it down. I'm feeling good. Let's get right to it, man. Let's talk about Michael Jackson's doctor. Oh, Michael Jackson got the worst doctor ever. I ain't never seen a doctor don't know nothing. Like, "Uh, Conrad, do you know CPR?" "Uh-uh." I mean, damn! $150,000 a month, and you don't know. Let me tell you something right now. I'm gonna be honest with you. I didn't know Michael Jackson needed a nap that bad. "What... what's this? Profofol? "I don't even know how to say "Profofol." I don't know about y'all, but I don't need sleep that bad. All I need to do is get me a slice of peach cobbler and sweet tea, I'll be out for three days. I don't want it that damn bad. You know one thing I love? How many people here love Michael Jackson, by round of applause, still? Love the music. Oh, I love the music. I'm a big Michael Jackson fan. I don't know if you all knew I interviewed Michael Jackson in 1997. Me and Mike sitting there kicking it, right? Lemme tell you what Michael Jackson taught me about my life. First of all, live your life to the fullest, people. Do your thing, live your dream, go for it, 'cause you know what? At the end of the day, you're gonna die. But at least if you die and you do something with your life like Michael Jackson, they will lay your ass out nice. Did you see his funeral? It was at the Staples Center. That's some gangster-ass. My cousin died, his was at Jiffy Lube. We're like, " damn it... "you shoulda did more with your life, Curtis... This is bull." Another thing I learned from Michael Jackson... This is gonna sound weird, but it's true. Michael Jackson taught me that you gotta know when you're gonna die, people. Don't pick no -up day to die. Pick a day to die when you're the only person that really died. If you pick a day when somebody bigger than you dies, you're just dead. Farrah Fawcett made that mistake. Yup. Yeah. Y'all didn't know that? Farrah Fawcett died the same damn day. Farrah Fawcett died at 1:00, Mike died at 4:00. They was like, ", you shoulda held on. Ain't nobody tell you to die today." I'm just being real. Went to the MTV awards, man, I had a good time. But lemme tell you something right now. That Lil Wayn is something else. Ain't Lil Wayne something else? He got... he might be one of the hottest rappers alive right now. You just can't look at Lil Wayne. It's very difficult. He's got to be one of the ugliest people I've ever seen. He looks like one of them little creatures from Harry Potter. Is it just me? But he be going at it... It's hard, but he go hard on his song. ♪ Turn the music up ♪ A little louder ♪ Had a lotta crooks try steal your heart ♪ ♪ Never figured out how to luh ♪ Scaring all the kids in the front. I ain't never seen a brother wear jeggings before. Did you see this? Little tight-ass pants on, about to get a yeast infection. Is it just me? Just wondering. Then I love my Beyonce. Beyonce and the gang. Give it up for Beyonce. Ooh, we love Beyonce. Oh, she looks so good. I got a little crush on Beyonce. I'm just being real. I mean, she just looks so good to me, you know? She got that little, cute, little body, little hips, she can dance... boom, boom, boom. I just hate when, you know, she be in the video with Jay-Z. It just throws me off. Don't it seem like he always wants to get in her sexiest video? And I'll be standing there looking, I'll be like, "Yo, you better stop playing." As soon as it gets good, here comes Jay-Z. "You ready, B?" Like, "Move, Jigga! Get out the way!" I'm happy for them, you know what I'm saying? But the weird thing is people are not talking, but people thinking it. They're wondering about that baby, like, "Ooh, Lord. Ooh, Lord, let that baby be on Beyonce's side." You don't want your baby to have a Jigga face, you know. That is not the face you want for your little baby. And people get on me 'cause I talk about Jay-Z. I love Jay-Z and Beyonce, but I gotta be honest. First of all, we know that that is a money situation. There's no way in hell he coulda ever pulled Beyonce if he wasn't Jay-Z. If his name was just Shawn... Seriously, if his name was just Shawn, he couldn't pull one woman in this beautiful theater tonight. Like if he was in here, one of y'all ladies got up, go to the bathroom, he'd be like, "'Scuse me, how you doing?'" You'd be like, "What... Kill yourself... Who was that? "Oh, my God. "What'd he say? "Oh, my God... I am not that thirsty... Whatever. I like being out here in California, you know. The thing that I learned about California that's throwing me off is this has got to be the flip-flop capital of the world. Everybody in California got their toes out. Pap-pap, pap, pap, pap-pap, pap. I've never seen no like this. Everybody wears flip-flops. Especially white people. Y'all love flops. White people wear flip-flops every... where. Flip-flops might be the best shoe in the world. Seriously, right? Especially if you fly. You go through the airport... you ever know LAX is a little weird? LAX is a weird airport. I don't know why they take it so serious, the security. You ever notice that? They think they really work for the government. Seriously. You ever see the guy who really thinks he work for the government, taking his job a little too serious... All you want to do is make your flight. "All right, everybody, please step forward. "Please remove your shoes, people. "Please remove your hats, "please remove your battery of your computer, "put it on the belt. "Thank you. "Please remove all liquids, people. "Remove all liquids. "K-Y is a liquid." No lie. I'm almost about to miss my flight, there's a white guy in front of me, he's pissed. All he got on is a fuckin' baseball hat, tee shirt, shorts and flops. Funniest I've ever seen, right? He ain't take off his shoes. He walked right through security with his flip-flops on. Security dude almost lost his mind. "Maybe you did not hear me, sir. "I said... "I said, 'Remove your shoes, Place them on the belt.' "Can you please back up?" White dude was like, "Dude, what're you talking about, bro? These are flops." Everybody... Everybody in line is like, "Oh, this about to go down!" Security guy said, "First of all, sir, I just want to say to you right now, "if you do not remove your flops, place them on the belt, you will not make your flight." He's like, "Bro, what're you talking about, bro? "I'm not a terrorist. "Flops, bro. "That's all they are. "Okay? "It's not like I'm gonna get on the plane "and all of a sudden go boom, boom. What the?" Swear to God. So, the security guy goes, "All right, I'm gonna tell you right now "if you do not remove your flops, you will be arrested." He was like, "You know what, bro? Pick 'em up your self." That is the most gangster I ever seen. "Pick 'em up your self." Soon as I landed, I went to Walmart, bought me some flops. Yeah. I'm in the mirror... "Pick 'em up your self." Lemme tell you something right now. What I just do not understand... I want to share this with y'all right now. I just recently found out that I was kinda freaky, and I'm gonna be honest with you, how many people here know they're a freak? Anybody up here? You know how I knew I was a freak? The internet. The internet will make you realize you are a freak. Seriously, anybody ever been to a sex chat room? Okay, I'm the only one with a computer. My bad. My bad. My bad. I suggest everybody go to a sex chat room one time, so you see what I'm talking about. 'Cause if you are a freak like me, you ever want to know where your freak at, know what I'm saying, do you ever just think about, "Where is my freak?" You know, you want to either be here or there in the freak pool. You don't want to be a weak freak, you want to be at the top of the freak gang. Now, here's the cool thing. All you got to do is go to a sex chat room. You're in your house, you're good. Get on the computer and read. It's amazing what freaky people are doing right now. Now, I like to sit in the dark. I don't know how you do it. All you got to do is get you a notepad. It's amazing what people are talking about, right? I'm sitting there, and you don't even realize you getting turned on. I'm like, "Oh. "Ooh, you're nasty." Like, "Ooh, why y'all do that? Oh, I can't do that." And they be talking about wild too. You be like, "Oh... "Oh, y'all doin' orgies, wow. "15 people... Ooh. "Oh, that's nasty. Uh, Imma try three, that's nice." Now, you're reading, right? And you're getting turned on, but you know, you're kind of nervous, you want to type in some. But what if somebody knows you in there? Somebody from your job, you know what I'm talking about? Somebody from your church, you know they freaky. But here's the crazy thing. There are, like, 80 people in there. 80 real freaks. I'm just around, right? So, I say, "Yo, what's up, everybody?" I didn't know... I did not know you gotta have a screen name. So, they was like, "Who are you?" I was like, "... "I don't know who I am." So, I'm like, "Yo, who want to play with me tonight?" Immediately... remember I told you, no matter how freaky you are, there's somebody on the other end of that computer that's freakier than you. I was like, "Who want to play with me tonight?" "Who are you..." Send. I said, "Oh... Who am I?" 'Cause you need a screen name. So I went deep inside my freak. I came back with this. Like, uh, "What's up, everybody? "This is 'Cat Daddy.' Who want to play with me tonight?" Immediately, somebody types back, "Oh, my God, Cat Daddy... Welcome to the chat room. "I'm Miss Kitty... Meow." I swear to God I heard that. But Miss Kitty is a real freak. She's like, "Cat Daddy, I'm so wet. What do you want to do to me tonight?" I'm like, I don't know. I ain't never been in no chat room before. It's real freaks in there. So, I had to go deep, deep inside my freak, and Imma share this with y'all. I was like, "Miss Kitty, you ever had a man take some "warm, hot butter popcorn oil. "Pour it down your back and let the popcorn fall in your booty crack... "Send. I don't even know where that came from. But you know what? The chat room went crazy. They was like, "Who's Cat Daddy? "Oh my God... "OMG. Cat Daddy is crazy." So Miss Kitty came right back. She's like, "Oh, my God, Cat Daddy, "hot butter popcorn oil all over my booty. "You're so sexy. "But I gotta be honest. I like margarine in my booty." Send. Oh, that's nasty. Now, get this. Miss Kitty turned on, she's like, "Oh, my God, Cat Daddy, "what's next? Got me so hot." I'm like, that's all I got. I ain't... I ain't no real freak. Now I got 80 people in the chat room that think that Cat Daddy is a beast, so they all leaning on me. That's a lot of pressure. I'm sitting in the dark for about a half-hour. They're like, "Cat Daddy, are you still online?" I'm like, "Wait." So, I came back with a masterpiece, and I'm gonna share it with y'all, 'cause y'all my people. I said, uh, "Miss Kitty, I'm back, baby. Sorry for the delay. But have you ever had a man lay you on a comforter on your belly, take a small pillow, place that under your stomach, get that ass real high... Then I'm gonna take a whole bowl of Apple Jack milk..." Y'all, it's my fantasy. Shh. "You ever had a man... take a whole bowl of Apple Jack milk pour it down your back and let the little nuggets fall in your booty crack?" Send. Don't you know I don't know where that came from? I set the chat room on fire. Everybody's like, "Apple Jack milk? Google that shit. Man. WTF, OMG, Cat Daddy is a beast." Miss Kitty's so turned on. She's like, "Oh, my God, Cat Daddy, really? Apple Jack milk all over my booty? But I gotta be honest, I like Frosted Flakes, Daddy. "But here's my address. "I want to see you tomorrow, and you better bring your Apple Jack milk." Send. "Oh, what I'm gonna do?" Now, you're a regular freak, she's a super freak. Outta curiosity, you want to meet her just to see if it's real. Next day, you wake up, you go to Costco, you get a box of Apple Jacks this big. 'Cause you goin' in. You show up on time, 3:00. You don't even realize you look crazier than a, walking around with this big box of Apple Jacks. You ring the doorbell, you're like... , Looking through the window. Oh, this is a nice house." She comes to the door, she is the finest woman you've ever seen. Puh! You're like, "Oh. "Oh, my God. "Oh, my God, oh, my God. Uh... "Are you, uh... Are you Miss Kitty?" "Yes, I am. Are you Cat Daddy?" "Yes, I am." "Are you really gonna take that Apple Jack milk and pour it down my booty?" "Yes, I am. Do you have that comforter I told you about?" "Yes, it's upstairs." So, you go upstairs, you're all excited, you like, "Yeah." So you walk into the bedroom, you know, you see the comforter, you see the nice little down pillow and out the closet... "Welcome to Dateline. I'm Chris Hansen." "Oh, my God. Why is there so many people in here?" "Have you seen my show 'To Catch a Predator?' Hey, aren't you Bill Bellamy?" "No, I'm Chris Rock... This some bull. This is a favorite part of my show, I like to call, "White people news." White people news is news that only happen to white people. I'll explain: real stories in the newspaper that only happen to white people. I'll share it with you. All right, have you heard the story last year about the lady at Seaworld that got killed by the whale? Okay, right. Only can happen to white people. I just happened to be watching CNN and her best friend was on TV doing an interview, who survived. She was like, "My friend was such a good person. And, oh, my God. She trained animals. She loved them. And, out of nowhere, the whale... Oh, my God. Oh, my God. The whale killed my friend." I'm like, ", it's a killer whale." Real quick, real quick. Did y'all hear about the white lady living with the monkey? Did you hear about that? White people, look at me. White people, look at me. Where... where are y'all getting these monkeys? I do not know how to get no monkey, okay. Is there a 1-800 monkey hotline black people don't know about 'cause I don't know how to get no monkey. First of all, this lady raised this monkey... This is a true story. This lady raised a monkey, from a baby. Raised him in an apartment. This is some crazy. Okay? First of all, I don't know if y'all realize that this wasn't no regular monkey. This was a 200-pound chimpanzee. That's a dude. She gave him a real name too. Gave him a real name: Travis. Now, here's the crazy thing. I did my research. I don't know if y'all know this, that monkeys are eight to 10 times stronger than us, right? So, just think, there's a guy here... You a big guy, you strong. He's 10 times stronger than you. What the you gonna do? Okay? This is why I think about it like this. I look at it like this. I don't care how much you train the monkey, people, okay? You put a little monkey Rocawear on him, okay? Well, little monkey George is still a monkey, okay? And Imma tell you another little secret. I don't care how much you train that monkey. He is still a monkey and at some point, he gonna do what? Some monkey. Yeah. Yeah. And this is the crazy thing. She left the monkey in an apartment. And I thought about this monkey. I felt... I said, "What was he going through before he went crazy?" You know? Said, "Maybe he was just sitting there having monkey thoughts." Sitting in an apartment. He used to live in the jungle. He was probably watching Animal Planet. Looking at his cousins... Just thinking about his life. Like, "Why the I got on sneakers? This got this hot-ass turtleneck on me. What the? I got a watch on. I can't even tell time. What the? When this lady get home, Imma beat the brakes off this." When this lady came home, this monkey went nuts. She came home from the mall with her girlfriend. This monkey... I don't know if this monkey recognized her, whatever, she came from the mall. You know, had a different wig on with her girlfriend. The monkey was like, "Who that?" This monkey ripped this lady's face off. Bit her hands. This is real. Okay, here's the thing. She survived. Thank God she survived. She was on Oprah. I don't know if y'all saw this. She was so up, Oprah couldn't even look at her. She was like, ", go to commercial. Gayle, you see this... Ugh." See, that would never happen to black people, 'cause we too smart for that. Black people, we don't set ourselves up to get killed. We are from Africa, okay? We know how animals work. I'll show you how serious black people are about animals. We won't even go to our favorite Uncle house, who got a dog, unless he tied up. Yeah. Now, we might show up to the house, but we won't get out the car. We be right in the driveway, roll the window down just a little bit. "Junior, where the dog at?" "Hey, boy, come on, now. Get out the car and get something to eat." "I ain't with your dog, Junior. "That dog done bit everybody in our family." "He ain't bite you." That's the thing that kills me about people with dogs. "He don't bite? "He got teeth, he bite." Where my dog lovers at... Dog lovers in the house? Dog lovers, who am I talking to? Let me tell you, I didn't realize dog love was real, until I came to California. Love for dogs out here is over the top. First of all, white families, y'all love y'all dog like it's one of y'all kids. I'm not bull. You go to any white family you know, look at the pictures in their house. That dog is in the pictures, with the kids. He on the iPhone. Black families, we a little different, right? We a little different... We love our dogs. But black families, let's be honest, we love our dogs, but we know that dog is not a part of our family, he just lives with us. Imma let you in on a little secret in the black family. A dog is one mistake from being killed every day. Let that dog do some dumb he ain't supposed to do. Like, for instance, we just bought brand-new carpet. And that dog everywhere. We will have no more dog. People be coming over to the house... "Uh, hey, uh, where's the dog?" "Don't worry about it... How you like the rug?" Know what else I noticed about dog owners? White families, y'all always know when y'all gonna get a dog. You know what I realized? I realized that the white mom decides the day the kids are gonna get the dog. This is how it works, right? Usually, in the white family, it's so organized. Y'all don't just randomly get a dog. Y'all plan for it. It's... it's all in order. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm gonna show you what I'm talking about. I would like to introduce you to the white mom on the day she gets her new dog. "Oh, my God. "I just want to thank you for being a part of our life. "You picked us. "And we chose you. "And we're gonna love you. "We're gonna take care of you. "Now I'm gonna go to the doc. "You know, we gonna get our shots. "I'm coming right back. "I'm your new mom. "Stay right there. "Hi, doc, how are you? "Uh, well, I just want to say to you, I got my new dog today. "He's in the lobby. "And, um, I'm really nervous. "But, uh, our kids don't know. "It's gonna be a surprise today. "And it's gonna be a great day in our family. "Can you come out and look at my dog, yeah? "Look at his eyes. "Tell me they're not gorgeous. "A couple weeks ago, we were having family night. "And we were watching a movie and I'm making popcorn. "And I see my kids' face light up "when this dog comes on the screen. "I think movie was, like, Marley & Me or something. "And I said to myself, 'I'm gonna get that dog.' "So, what I do, I go online. "I Google. "I start with five kennels. "I narrow it down to two, one. "$4,000 later, he's here. "It doesn't matter. "I make it rain for my kids. "Now, um, I know he needs his shots. "So, whatever it is, throw it on a card. "Now I am going to go get my nails done. "I'll be back, yeah. "I need a favor though. "Can he get a shampoo? "Because he smells like dog. I don't like it." This lady is gonna go get her nails done, come back, dog is gonna be pretty, smell like strawberries. The kids gonna come home from school, 3:00, go crazy. They gonna bake some cookies and welcome that dog to their family. Can we give it for the white family, please? Can we give it up? Such a beautiful day. Black family a little different, right? You know why the black family is different? 'Cause we not organized like that. And we never know we gonna get a dog. Situations come up and we have a dog. Like, "Your sister and her boyfriend broke up. We got a dog." You know what I'm talking about? And usually, in the black family, it's the father, right? The father picked the dog. He don't mean to get the dog. Like, the father was going to get his oil changed, he come back with a dog. So, ladies and gentlemen, Imma introduce you tonight to the black dad on the day he gets his dog. "Oh! "Aah. "I don't even know if we can have a dog. "Damn. "You lucky my kids been asking me about a damn dog. "Now I gotta go to the doc... Ah, this... "I'll be right back, man. "Hey, hey, doc, can I talk... "Where'd I get the dog from? "Man, this crackhead came in the barbershop. "Yeah. "Yeah, he had a box of puppies rattling around. "Getting my hair cut. "Excuse me? "What kind of dog is it? "Hey, uh, what he look like? "All right, then that's what he is. "So my boy who cut my hair, said, uh, you know, "he said that, uh, puppies need shots and. "So I was just wondering how many... "Excuse me? "How much the dog cost? ", man, you ain't gonna believe me, man. "Guess. "I got him for $5. "Yeah, man, first of all, the crackhead "tried to charge me $600. "I knock it down. "You know, man, I got a deal. "Uh, so, out of curiosity, man, "'cause I don't know nothing about no dog. "Uh, how many shots do a $5 dog need? "Excuse me? "Six shots? "Six shots, I'll be damned. "Six shots, ugh. "How much them shots apiece? "Excuse me? "100... 100 apiece. "100 apiece. "You want me to spend $600 on a $5 dog? "All right, which one he really need? "Then that's the one he gonna get... There you go." Been on the road, man, having a whole bunch of fun. I wanna share this with y'all. This a thing I learned about Atlanta that's interesting, right? I did not know that in Atlanta, when people leave the nightclub, they go to the strip club. That's what they do, right? So that's the afterhours in Atlanta. And I... I didn't know this. So I'm in Atlanta. And I find out that making it rain is real. I don't know if you ever heard about this. Now, if you never heard of making it rain, I will explain it to you. It's basically when you take your money, and you throw it on other people. I'm never gonna do that. I'm just telling you what other people are doing. Now, the cool thing is, everybody go to the strip clubs. Guys and girls. So we would all leave the nightclub, go to the strip club. So I don't know. I'm a little tipsy. I don't know that making it rain is real. Now, get this, I go to this strip club called Magic City. Magic City has got to be... Yeah, you know what I'm talking about... He know, he know. Magic City gotta be one of the flyest strip clubs in the world. I mean, I've never seen a strip club like this. The women are incredible. They look like superheroes. It's unbelievable. I walk up in there. Every celebrity, every, you know, athlete, whoever you know, is in there, right? I get there, I'm like, "Damn, my feet are so soft right now. Why... why?" I look down. I'm standing on, like, $80,000. And I don't know if y'all know me. I grew up in the hood. I'm having hood thoughts. I'm trying to kick some up in my booth. Now, nobody in the strip club is even thinking about the money. I'm tripping. I'm like, "Ooh, where is my golf shoes when I need them?" So... So, get this, right? So, I'm like... I'm chilling. I don't even have my bottles yet, I'm chilling. I'm like, "Oh." I look to my right... it's Jeezy. Jeezy is in there. He's got about 10 dudes with him, right? I'm like, "Yo, he got a black garbage bag in the VIP." I'm like, "What the fuck is he doing?" 'Cause I'm nosey, I look. In this black garbage bag is $40,000. I'm like, "Wow..." Maybe $50,000. I don't know what it is. It's a lot of money with rubber bands on it, right? I'm like, "What is he gonna do with that?" Jeezy takes about $40,000 out this black garbage bag, pops the rubber bands off and throw it in the mother air. ♪ I put on for my city on on For my city put on ♪ All I could say was. Ahhhhhhh! I'm serious, because I never been rained on before. I was like... That was spiritual. But now... Now, the whole VIP is going crazy. Jeezy got it set off. So now, Jay-Z in there. I'm like, "Oh, Jigga in here?" And Jay-Z got crazy paper, right? So Jay-Z's like, " What is he doing? "This is crazy... What is he talking about? "It's 40,000... that's no money. "I'm just gonna use Beyonce money. "The Roc is in the building." Jigga grabs $100,000, crack that open, throw it in the air. Whoosh. My name is Ho oh H to the OV I'm like... Ahhhhh! That's $140,000 in the air, people. I cannot believe this is real, okay? The next booth is 50 Cent and Floyd Mayweather. You know, they got crazy paper. But here's the thing. Jay-Z got the party on smash. So Floyd and 50 are a little jealous. He's like, "The going on, man? "The going on? "Jigga's trying to show out, huh? "Jigga trying to act like he make it rain 100,000. "That's no money, Floyd. "You know what I'm saying? "You know what I mean? "Yo, if Jay-Z right now... Jay gonna make it rain. We about to make it thunderstorm in this mother." Now I'm gonna be real with y'all. I'm not the smartest dude in the world, but I know that a thunderstorm is more than rain. So, "Yo, tell my man to go and get my money out the back." So this big buff dude goes in the back of the strip club and comes out with a block of money, wrapped in plastic. I have never seen no like this. Boom, on the table. "I said, "Oh. "$200,000 wrapped in plastic. They got they own bank?" This money is stuck together. Dude rolls up with a straight razor. Crack this money open. This money is stuck together, $200,000. They throwing it, knocking strippers out. Pow. Pow. Pow. 50 like, ♪ Have a baby by me, baby, ♪ you be a millionaire, be a millionaire ♪ I was like ", I'll have your baby." This is so crazy. Oh, my God. "I am trying to get pregnant. "I swear I wanna get pregnant. Is this okay?" Don't you know, one of the strippers come rolling up on me. She's like, "Are you Bill Bellamy? "Oh, my God, I never thought I'd see you here. Bill, what you doing here?" I was like, ", I don't know." She was like, "Oh, my God. "Bill, I swear to God I never thought I'd see you here. "But welcome to the 'A'. "This how we do it in the 'A'. "We make it rain. "Jeezy threw up $40,000. "Jigga threw up $100,000. "And 50 just knocked me out with $200,000. What you gonna do, Bill?"

I don't know if y'all know this, grown chicks taking over the game right now. Yeah, it's an epidemic going now. Older women are snatching up young dudes, left and right. Yeah. Most people think that players are the guys. Realistically, the players are the ladies. The grown chicks are really the players. For real. I figured it out. Grown women got so much game. They do the sexy that young chicks don't even think about. That's how they get your mother ass. Now, ladies, if you 23, 24 right now, you look confused as... 'Cause you not old enough. You need to have your auntie on speed dial or somebody to help you. You know how a grown chick get a young dude? They do like give you a bath. Now, I know that sound crazy and I know there's a lot of dudes in here like, "Yo, Bill, go ahead will that bull, homeboy. Ain't nobody getting in no water" And they do it at the wrong time, though. Grown chicks plan to give you a bath... That's how they get your ass. But they always pick the wrong mother time to bathe you. I'll give you an example of what I'm talking about, fellas. Sunday is football day for dudes. Sunday... How many dudes love football? Yeah. Football is the best thing for men. That's where we can be a man. You're home on a Sunday, man. You watching the game at, like, 3:00. You got the NFL package. You are in heaven. You don't even know your lady home, you just watching TV. You ever just sit there sometime and have man thoughts? Just sitting there like, "Man, it's nice and quiet. "Nobody asking me no dumb-ass questions. "Yep, I ain't got to fix. "Imma sit here and on myself. I always wanted to do that." Why is it that your woman would ask you to come upstairs right when the best play in football happens? That's how man time and woman time is different. You ever notice that? You downstairs watching the best touchdown pass ever. You're like, "Oh!" She's like, "Come upstairs, we got a problem." "Oh... What'd I do? Baby, if you wanna argue, I already won... The game on." "You better get your ass upstairs... we got a problem." "Oh. "Bet you she went on my computer. "Saw my Apple Jack milk. "I don't want no trouble, baby. "The game on... I got money on the game. Everything cool?" "No, we have a problem... Come upstairs." "Oh, that's bad." Why when you're scared... Your mind play tricks on you? "I'm in the bathroom" "The bathroom?" "Oh, this gonna drown me. What'd I do?" Your heart beating, you scared as. You walk in the bedroom, but the bathroom door closed. You're like, "Oh, my God." The bathroom, bottom of the door, all you see is, like, fog.

Everything all right?" "No... Open the door." "Oh! "God, please, man. "Please don't let my baby be no vampire. Now, you open the door. You're scared as hell. All you see is steam and candles everywhere. You're like, "The? "Wow, it look like a church in here. Baby, where you at?" She's like, "I'm right here." "The? I can't see." "I'm in the tub." "The you doing in the tub?" "Surprise. "I wanted you to come upstairs, "so that's why I made it seem like it was a problem. "But it's not a problem. "All I wanted to do is give you a bath, so... "Take off your clothes and get in the tub." "The wrong with you? "I took a bath last week. I don't need no bath." "Listen, don't mess this up. "I really planned. "Everything is fine.
