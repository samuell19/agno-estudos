The man and the woman were naked together. And were unashamed. You have to understand,this bowler hat, had to serve for funerals, weddings, all our union meetings and all the gatherings at the chapel. And chapel was very important to my father. A very strict religious man. Well first of all, my brother was a drinking man. Secondly he was mother and father to me. Washed my face, blew my nose, packed me off to school. And in his spare time, he did happen to be one of the best bloody coal miners in the whole of south Wales. Isn't he gorgeous? Who are you? One of our Venetian characters. Part-time writer, part-time guide,and a couple of other things. She's perfectly right. A writer! It was said of my brother, that he could shift enough coal in one day to keep the express from Cardiff to Paddington running for a whole week. For you Mr. Tyvian. ...himself starts clattering down the hill towards his buddies cot. Alright people, the drinks are on me. Please finish, Ty. I don't suppose, Tyvian, that you even remember why we are here today? "If I forget thee..." It was a sun-splintered summers day. Venice, film festival time. The book had made me famous, the film had made me rich. I rode the waters of Babylon on a chariot of speed. Here with us are Mr Branco and Mr Jones. Mr Branco, your impressions, please. What can I say? I hope to win the Festival. This is Tyvian Jones, the author. Mr Jones, your impressions, please? Well Im not bothered really, you know? I had a bad leg. Well, done, Vittorio! Paddles! Francesca, at last! Hello, Anna Maria. - Good evening. - Hello Sergio! Well, quite a crowd! Tyvian, I'm so glad for you. - Congratulations! - Thank you. Darling, you were extraordinary, - Thank you Sergio. - Just extraordinary. I mean that. Do you think they liked it? Do you think we have a success? So the emperor is dragging you off to Rome. I left my very best nightgown in your bedroom. So you wouldn't be lonely. I always thought your book would make a great picture. As usual, I was right! Oh Sergio, Francesca and I had to persuade you to do this picture at the point of a gun! Success has a thousand fathers... and mothers. Signore Branco? - Yes? I think your film is a significant advance on the problem of telling a story at different levels of time and consciousness. Well, that's nice of you. I'd like you to meet Francesca Ferrara. Take care of him. May I present the man who did the screenplay, Mr Arthur McCormick. Excuse me. Thank you. Left with me. Not that I will ever forgive you, trot along my old countess, and find yourself a drink. Champagne! Thank you. Tyvian? No thank you. Would you please bring us a glass of tomato juice on the rocks. From your book I had gathered that the Welsh were a drinking people, Mr Jones. And that all Italians are great lovers. Let's be friends tonight. My picture... Our picture is a great success. I hope to get another story from you Tyvian. That is if you can ever get him to write it. I can. As a matter of fact, Anna Maria has just rented me place near Torcello. I intend to start my new novel there. Fine, I'll buy it, just on an outline. I'll give you an advance right now, and a larger sum if I like the novel. Oh, if you're going to talk about money... But Tyvian is not interested in money. Of course I'm interested in all your lovely money, Signore Branco. When do you want the book? Now? Yes. Now. Sergio! I'll worry about the details, "Story by Tyvian Jones screenplay by Arthur McCormick." Italian dialogues by Mrs Tyvian Jones. Oh! Now listen! Listen to me, everybody! Give me a hand. The authors of tonight's success are going to continue working as collaborators. Tyvian will write a new story for Branco, and our dear Francesca will find a husband. To Francesca and Tyvian! To their future! I want to say goodbye to Tyvian. I'll see you at the airport. For one ghastly moment, darling, I thought you were going to announce our wedding. Thinking about your new novel? You know, our wedding will have to be in a gondola, Tyvian. That's my church, della Salute. Yeah, I know. Do you mind? Look, I stopped worrying about church, and chapel, a long time ago. Francesca... Any wedding you like. As long as there's a wedding night. Can't Branco run his business for one day without you? He likes to think he can't. Don't go to Rome tonight, Francesca. Stay with me. All right, I will. I'll ask Branco. No! No, your job's important. We'll see each other next weekend. What's the matter? There's nothing I can do, we've got a broken rudder. It'll take me half an hour to fix it. A broken rudder? That's all we need. One way is... - How? Row, I suppose. Look, there's a house. Come pick us up there after you've fixed the rudder. No, it's nothing sweetheart. Don't worry, it's really nothing. Come on sweetheart, take my hand. Well there we are, let's get out of this rain. Oh! Wait, I'll turn on the light Go on upstairs. Meanwhile, I'll close the window. Take this. Yes, certainly. Anything you say darling Lovely place, isn't it? Put it here. Open it! Yes sweetheart. A stroke of luck we found this place. Do you want to change? I'll leave you alone. In the meantime I'll light a fire. Thank you. I"ll be waiting downstairs. Hey, what do you want here? What do you mean, "What do I want?" What the hell do you want? What are you doing here? I'm with a friend. You'll treat my place like a hotel? Well you can stop that for a start. So you smashed my windows and turned the place into a pigsty? And where is this friend of yours? Fix yourself a drink. Are you ready, sweetheart? I'm sorry, but it's not my fault. I took the liberty of mixing one for you too. Well that's very nice of you. I don't drink. Pieri is my name. Silvano Pieri. I had a reservation at the hotel further along. But with a broken rudder and the storm... Well you're quite welcome to stay. Hello. Has our host given you a drink too? May I help? This is madame Olivieri. Olivier. So you got wet? I nearly turned back to spend the night in Venice. I'm glad now I didn't. You're French. You live in Venice? I do. The lady lives in Rome. I thought I knew Rome well... I've obviously been missing something. I think you must be tired, Eva. Don't you want to go to bed? You two must be hungry, there's a bucket of eggs in the fridge, some coffee if you like. No, no thank you. We dined late. Where do I sleep? In there. My room. You sure I can't get you something to eat? I wanted to make sure you're comfortable. I don't entertain women here very often. You don't believe me? If you give me your wet things, I'll put them in the kitchen to dry. Look. I'm sorry for this intrusion, but this is clear. That girl is mine. You understand? You think I'm lending you my bed, you're out of your mind. I've waited a long time for tonight. But not in my house, cock, you sleep down here, I sleep in the study. Let me explain. She's only in Venice for this weekend. Oh sad man, sad. Look here my friend, buying handbags, airplane tickets even a small, and very expensive, painting. All very expensive. She(You) might say she has an obligation to me. Between gentlemen... Between gentlemen... Look. I'll rent your house, anything you want. You're gonna sell the bloody shopkeeper? (You've got a soul of a bloody shopkeeper?) I'm wasting my time with you! Your friend is gone. He seems to think you're under an obligation. Now, that's not my style. Me, I have the right of conquest. You must be pretty good. He offered to rent the house... for the night. Tell me about the husband. He's handsome, of course... That's why you cheat on him with Venetian merchants. Why not with me, then eh? Why not? Let's see what you can do. Et voila! (There we are.) Hello? Yes, this is Madame Olivier. It's the Colonel. He wants to talk to you. I'm sorry sir, she can't speak to you now. At what time? Half past eight. Very well, I'll give her the message. The dress. Well, what did the doctor say is wrong with you? Oh nothing, I'm fine. Isn't that simply wonderful! Do you have enough money? Well maybe not as much as your boyfriend has, but I'll spend more. How about dinner? He'll pay for it. I've eaten. You always eat before you go out for dinner? Yes. Allow me to buy you all a drink. I cannot expect you to weep for me sober. He's right. Bye. Hello my beauty. Would you like to leave your coats? Would you hold my coat? Hello Ty, thought you were in Venice! I shan't ask you what you're doing in Rome. Come and join McCormick's wailing wall. Sorry mate. Anna Maria proposed to me again this afternoon. Noblesse oblige, I accepted. We're just having a little stag party. Yeah, I can see. That costs money. Alas, wives cost money too. Give me a drink! Have another drink old chap, you might as well. I'm going to be paying for it! Shh! Come, come. Shh! What do you like best? In the whole world? Money. Why... Why money? To buy records. And what do you hate the most? Apart from men. Apart from men? Old women! Eve... I suppose it's safe to assume the husband is not in the apartment? He's in Africa. Africa! He's an engineer. He's in Africa working on a dam. Well, suppose suppose he decides to fly home? Tonight. Then you'd have to protect me. Well that would depend on how big he was. He's very big. Black, wavy hair. Big nose. Big mouth. He's a real man. He can handle me. Et voila. (There we are.) Even my husband doesn't know I have this place. Thank you for a lovely evening. See, once the chapel is in your blood, it's the devil to get rid of it. You're either for it, or against it. You just can't forget it. I'll tell you something my fancy friends don't know. I was never really a coal miner. Oh I tried it for six weeks. But it was my brother who was the miner. Look! Does it squirt? We were orphans too, my sister and myself. She took in washing in Lyon. Until she got sick of tuberculous. The man who lived above us, he was married with five children. I don't even remember his name. He had red birth-marks on his hands. He said he would look after us, if... I was eleven, you understand. You'd believe anything! Eve? Eve? What made you let me in this time? You've taken me a lot of places, you've given me a lot of things. Is that the only reason? You have some unexpected things. Very small... but very expensive. Expert at this, making a show. You saw my island place, in Venice. Shoes, hand-made. Suit, bespoke. What's inside doesn't count. But that lamp... That's definitely got to go! What about this? It's a present from my husband. All of them? One for each time he comes home. Where is your real home? In the country near Rome, we have a farmhouse. Would you introduce me to your husband? I might. He's very jealous. Furrows... Furrows... Greta Garbo wears a small triangle of cork plaster, just there. To keep the wrinkles away. Actually, you're quite attractive. They all say that. If you just think I'm one of those... You find me attractive? Mean. Cruel. Vicious. Destructive. I think I'm ugly. I might persuade you you're not. I like to make women happy. Think that's conceited? Just accurate. Let's see what you can do. Don't fall in love with me. Not conceited. Just accurate. Grazie! (Thank you.) Breakfast? POEMS - T.S. ELIOT With love, Tyvian. "I love you, I love you, I love you!" Why don't you say it Tyvian? I've said it. Look, I'm sorry I wasn't here. This morning was a nice surprise. It was not easy. Oh come off it Francesca, you've been here often enough before. Not without an invitation. You don't need one. I'll be late for work. Francesca. Look Francesca, I'm not going to account for my actions, now, or ever. Alright, I was with a woman. You know me. I'm one of those, I can't change. I love all women, six to sixty. And they're all the same, are they? Well I'm not. You'll have to make your choice Tyvian. Francesca. What's happened. What's the matter? Please. Francesca... Oh Francesca. Buon giorno signore Branco. (Good morning, Mr Branco.) Your taxi wasn't accepted. What have you done to her? Is that your business too? Until now I have respected her preference for you, Tyvian. But I refuse to do so any longer. You have humiliated Francesca publicly. You've been seen with a woman, who is well known here. Who told you that? Rome is a village. You have no discretion and no respect for our customs. It's alright then if I'm discreet? I don't care about your morals. I care for her. Because I want her for myself. I warn you, Tyvian. When you hurt Francesca, you hurt me. As a man you are a fake. I believe you're also a fake as a writer. And I'm going to prove it. I'm investigating you. Mr Jones is at the door again. She's not here. I know she's here. Excuse me signore. I have a package for Madame Olivier. Here it is. Eve? Eve! I'm not moving until you let me in. "In memory of a very happy weekend." Karl. Eve! Eve! - Good morning, madam. - Good morning. - Would you like a coffee? - Yes, please. I'll be outside. You, hurry up. Excuse me. I'd like to see Madame Oliver. She's not in. You might find her in the park. The stranger in hell - Tyvian Jones Eve. Why won't you see me? You have to see me! Have to? I told you not to fall in love with me. Eve. Come away with me for the weekend, we can go back to my island near Venice. No. The best hotel in Venice. And gambling. The best hotel. Alright then. I'll think about it. I see. To the bridegroom! If McCormick can get married, why can't you? I don't know, ask him. Maybe he needs an agent. Why should an intelligent man like myself be subjected to this kind of tribal ritual. You don't have to marry me. Now she tells me. You should have seen Sergio's face. He likes your outline, I could have kissed him! He likes it enough to talk about it for a whole weekend. Serge is a businessman and there's $30,000, riding on your conference with him. But don't worry, he likes it. I'm the bridegroom! Why, you shouldn't even be seeing me before the wedding. Superstition my old strumpet, shut up, and deliver. Why don't you go ahead, I'll catch up. Pronto. (Hello?) No, not today, can't be today. I'm sorry, I can't do it. Tomorrow? Look, I'll call you back in five minutes. I said so, didn't I? Alright, alright I'll be there, yes yes immediately. Grazie. (Thank you.) Is there anything you'd like, signore? I've done everything you've wanted. As you ordered. Thank you. It's a first class cabin, alright. - Have a nice day. - Thank you. "The best hotel". Do you know how much this weekend's going to cost me? Do you? A few friends, $ 30,000... And a wife. That's something my husband would never do. What? Discuss money. I'd forgotten there was still three of us on this honeymoon. "Honeymoon"? I can laugh without drink, I can fight without drink... Get any woman I want without drink. So why should I drink? That's it! That's it! You've got to learn to keep that... up there. I'm a minority of one. A minority of one... like you! Come on... Come on! Stop playing your bloody games for just for one night! Wait til I meet you upstairs. Neville! I think your friend is a bit under the weather. Would you like to join our table? You're welcome if you wish to. Two large whiskies. For two damned souls, perishing of thirst. They must have found coal under the Grand Canal? Oh Englishman! A witty Englishman! Which you have to admit, is a contradiction in terms. Your not in the pub in Swansea now. You wouldn't like to say that again, would you Percy? You heard. Easy fella. Easy! Hello lovely! Come on. Buona serra. (Good evening.) Good night. Gentlemen. Buona serra. (Good evening.) We have other things to do. Good night. Boo! L...kiss... I don't know what you think about me. You probably don't think about me. The Best Hotel... It's a long way from the mines and the chapel is this. "Though you hide in the uttermost parts of the earth..." You're very like me, Eve. Francesca... She believes in me. Branco's waiting to trap me. The book. My book, my big success... It's my brother's book. I never wrote a line of it. "See what you can do with it, Tyvian boy." He said. And I put my name on it. I stole my dead brother's soul. Help me! Eve? Everything I told you about the book... I could've writen it. Did you write it? I said I could've... You said you were a thief. So you're a thief. Even my brother would admit... Is he dead, or not? Yes. Does he need his soul? My God... Yes, I know. You're sorry. I'm not sorry. What are you going to do now, without your $30,000? Your weekend is over. Do you have enough to pay the bill? That's my business. You have enough to pay me? You heard me. I want to be paid. Cash. How much do you think I can get for this? And this? It doesn't meet my price for a weekend. Here. I take money from a man. You're not a man. You're a loser. Go on loser! Take it! You need it worse than I do. What do you think I've been doing all the time? I've won money gambling. You even led me to a couple of clients. You earned it. Go on. Take it. And what does that make me? What does that make you? Get out. I told you not to fall in love with me. Get out! This is against the winter. You're a real Boy Scout! They say, Branco and the others, that... I married you for my career. Did you? I need you, Francesca. I love you. Sergio. Hello Sergio. How are you? And you? How are you? Fine thank you. Tyvian will be so glad to see you. Enzo told me you were here. I thought you were angry with me. You didn't come to the wedding. Whether married or not, you're still working for me, aren't you? Of course. My organisation doesn't work without you. I'm sorry to disturb your honeymoon. I'm showing the new version of the picture to some critics on Friday. I'd like Francesca to be there. Why tell me? That makes me feel very important Sergio. I brought you a wedding present Tyvian. The results of my investigations in your home town in Wales. Would you like to read it? You read it. I can see you are very much in love, Francesca. Yes. And you'll love him, no matter what he is. Yes. I was wrong. I apologize... To both of you. May I have a whiskey to warm me before I go back to Venice. Hello Ty. Why didn't you invite me to your wedding? Or didn't you know I was still in Venice? Tres chic! Tres cher! (Very chic, very expensive.) Did she pay for it? What's the matter? You've got nothing to say? Have you told her, about your brother? Ty? I sent your money back. I sent it back. Recommandé. (By registered mail.) To your flat in Rome. Are you there? You hear me? I don't want your dirty money! Pauvre tarte! (Poor fool!) What is it Tyvian? Nothing. I love you Tyvian. But how can we ever make it work... If you won't tell me. You must tell me. I will. Don't go to Rome tomorrow. I think I will now. I hope Sergio enjoys my honeymoon. I'll only be gone a day. Carte. (Card.) Carte. (Card.) It takes two to tango. What's the matter, I'm clean, see? Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen. Number seven. No more bets. You know her? Do you? She was my best friend at the Monte Carlo casino. And then she hooked herself a fat little man from Lyon. And got a big fat settlement! And now she doesn't even know me. And I'm every bit as good as she is. Do you know him, too? Michele? Ah, now there's a man. There's a real man. Just like you darling. Just like you. He's an engineer, isn't he? No, he's a gambler. A professional. Uh-huh. Not against him. He plays to win. Banco. (Bank.) Ciao Eva. (Hello, Eva.) Nine. The house wins. - Michele. - Nine. The lot. Banco. (Bank.) Loser. Wait for me! You look as though you could kill her. Maybe I will... Why don't you kill me instead? I'd like it. Too bad you came up against me. You never should challenge a man with a run of luck. You learn that when you've lost as much as I have. Really? At least introduce me to your husband. Mr. Jones... my husband. "Husband"? I changed his luck. Let's see what you'll do for me. I think Eve prefers to hold this gentleman's hand. Whiskey. One husband? Finito. (Over.) Only my husband can do that. It's the nicest time of the day. No. If you so much as touch the bed... And close the door. Francesca. Francesca! Francesca! Francesc... Don't! There we are. Go ahead, go ahead. Don't worry. Go ahead, madam. Please. Good night. - Night. - My dear. - Bye bye! - Bye. Bye! Eve? I need you! - Please. - Ah! Ah! Get out! Eve! Two years under the tolling of that bell. But it wasn't for you that I stayed in Venice, Francesca. Eve stayed. And I, part-time writer, part-time guide. Full time exile in my Babylon. "If I forget thee..." No doubt you will appreciate the beauty of our Greek islands. From an inside cabin? But no doubt you can persuade the purser. Uh-huh, I could It's only two years. And there's no wreath from you on Francesca's grave. Is she dead or not? Does she need a wreath? Aah, Mr Jones. Buona serra, signorina. (Good evening, miss.) Mr Kazakos. We sail in less than an hour, but Mr Jones, a drink? You'll be back in ten days, I'll meet the boat. I hope to have sold that story by then, we could go to the casino, make a night of it. Eve? I'll wait for you at the Danieli bar. Yes? If I come back... Bloody Welshman! "And he placed to the East of the Garden of Eden "Cherubims and a flaming sword. "Which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life."
