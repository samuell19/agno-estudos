[Steven] Well, Jack Warner may have been celebrated for calling writers schmucks with underwoods, but 20 years earlier, Irving Thalberg was asked, who is the most important person in this motion picture process, and Thalberg famously said, The most important person in the motion picture process is the writer and we must do everything in our power to prevent them from ever realizing it.&quot; ♪ ♪ What's the line from Death of a Salesman?

I like the challenge of it, and there's this really strong parallel to writing. You kind of have to wait for that momentum to come to you. You can catch a really great wave and you can ride it, you know, all the way into the shore just the same way that you can get a really great idea. It's not like I've done this a lot, but there's moments where I've stood up and it's quiet, and I know I'm sort of in the sweet spot. It's a very similar reaction to me when I'm writing and I know I've slipped into the zone, and the characters are speaking, everything's flowing freely. I'm essentially just along for the ride. ♪ ♪ [Joe] I've been married almost 16 years to Hillary. I have a 12-year-old daughter, Lexington. We call her Lex. My wife takes care of most of the stuff with her in the morning as far as getting her fed and stuff. I might help with the shoes and brushing teeth, and then eight o'clock, we're out of here. We start walking. Get me by the neck. When Lex was about two and a half years old, we noticed that her development plateaued. All the other kids kept progressing, and she didn't, and in fact regressed and so we took her around to experts until finally we got a diagnosis of autism. My wife went to work full time. She had benefits and so I became a full time trader. I trade in the morning, and I write in the afternoon and evening. ♪ ♪ So, why do you like hanging out in cemeteries? I don't know. Why do you like working in one? I don't know. Different I guess. The current state of affairs is we don't have underwoods. We're still the schmucks. We're the low people on the food chain. Let me talk about Little Rascals for a minute. For the first time ever, I heard actors saying my lines and my partner's lines, and it was, it was extremely thrilling because the kids, most of them were too young to change them so they're actually reading them as written, which was nice and hasn't happened a lot since then. Although I have to mention that one of the kids who was 10, came up to us when we were doing rewrites and said, &quot;You know, can you write some more stuff for me?&quot; And I thought this is good training. This will get me ready for the Jim Carreys of the world. Okay. Well, I'm going to go chant, which is probably what I should have done when I first got out of bed but did not.

As far as meeting the investor, I had to go to Chicago, but we will be meeting with her in the next day or two so pray for us. It was when I started putting my resume together to like go and approach another place about doing the same thing somewhere else, and I just was like no way, you know, no way. I'm... no.

Are you ready to do labels? Part of my sort of dual existence in Hollywood has been working at AK Talent Agency and trying to balance that with writing on the side. The morning grind. I work as an assistant to the theatrical agent. Why don't you try from tray one? See, there's labels... You have a tray here with labels already loaded in there. There's a lot of them, too. I have a pretty young literary manager. Right now, the most important thing is to find out exactly what they want from you. She helps me to keep my finger on the pulse of my own career. She helps me to prioritize what I need to address next. Selling a script that gets produced is, that's the homerun ball. Don't choke, Craig, pressure's on, man. You're printing, printing labels. Do I want to be walking down a red carpet and have paparazzi snapping my picture some day? Yeah, I do. I want to know what that experience is like. Printing labels has ground the company to a halt right now. I've been writing for going on 20 years. Normally, I write a screenplay in about three to six months. I have been working on my new story which is called Rattled for about three years. I am in year three. It's just that complex of a story, difficult of a story. It's soulfully difficult. It's character difficult. It's just a hard process. There's a lot of feeling that well, why am I doing this? Am I doing it for money or a career, because the truth is I can have a career as a trader or a financial advisor. I'd make more money, and if I really stopped writing and focused on that, I could probably be a millionaire in less than five years. If this story doesn't do for me what I'm saying that I need it to do, I've got to get real serious about considering whether I'm going to even write another one. Rattled is like 99 pages, and it's like these 99 pages have to determine my future. Oh, God. I remember on Dave I had written a bad draft, and I was like on page 150 and climbing. I had no money then. I went home, and I said to my wife, &quot;You know, I think I have to write this again because I'm not satisfied, I can't turn this in.&quot; So we took out a loan on our house, a second mortgage to finance the next draft, and Mike Ovitz, a very powerful agent in Hollywood at the time, was kind of yelling at me to deliver the script for one of his powerful clients because I was late. It was a huge amount of pressure. [Gary] I literally threw the first draft away, started again and wrote it from page one. [Deborah] I started writing something about someone who can't be in a relationship and why that would be. We hope When You're Not There will be shooting March, late March here in Venice. I've got to print out a new cast list. Our cast hopefuls rather. I think there's an initial kind of perception that maybe men know a little better, you know, what they're doing. Okay, that's Jessica's stuff. As a woman, maybe you need to be a little more prepared, but ultimately your passion, what you believe in, what your work ethic is, all those things are the bottom line, and anybody who's good who works with you is going to get that and is going to respect that and support that. These are budget samples. We're going to put everything we have essentially, you know, financially and, you know, which is what you're so not supposed to do, right, but we're doing it. If in the next six to eight weeks something significant hasn't clicked into gear, then we need to take a step back, which would include getting a job, not that this isn't a job but getting another kind of job, you know, a stop gap, you know. It's a very male business, and it has in vast portions of it the whole action movie part of it, might as well be the United States Army in 1943 in that the ethics of it are, you know, boot camp and action movies and guns and explosions and all the rest of it, and that, so that means that about 50% of the business is not only pretty much closed off to women, but women don't even want to be in it. [Scott] I could. Uh-huh. And I was told they financed, but are they interested in financing? Are they interested in...? They are? Uh-huh. All right, well, I mean, look, you convinced me. Can we set up a phone call with them tomorrow? I'm so grateful for all of your help and generosity. I feel a little awkward that I'm taking up so much of your time. All right. That was interesting. I have so much stuff to tell you. It's good that you can get Bruckheimer on the phone like that whenever you want. I had no idea that would take that long. There's a company in Spokane, Washington called North by Northwest, and you think he eats olives? No. And what it is is, it's a production house and a post production facility, and it has it's own distribution stream, and it has every crew member on its annual payroll so literally you go and raise money and you're a director and you go up to Spokane, and they deliver your film. I guess my biggest concern about a company like that is that it would be sort of an adversarial relationship because it's, you know, me versus this whole production house. Then it's just sort of a one stop shop, and you go up and they kind of do your movie. My instincts say that I don't have a great feeling about this sudden new option. - Really? - No. - How come? - It's too easy, man. It's too much like a, it's like a car salesman sort of mentality to me when it's like, just don't worry about it. The infrastructure's in place, everything will be taken care of for you. All you got to do is just direct it. Uh-huh. What? If there is fun in this, it's going to be putting all the pieces together under your control. But this could be so unfair to, you know, it could, that could be very unfair. Maybe these guys are... I'm going to shut up and eat more pizza. [Ed] The director is clearly the key instrument in the making of film. The first screenplay I ever sold was something I'd written with Chris Matheson, my sometimes writing partner. It was Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, and we had a meeting with the director, not Steve Herek who ended up directing the movie, but a director prior to that who had some really lame ideas, and Chris and I said, &quot;I don't think that would really work&quot;, and this director said, &quot;If you don't think that's a good idea, we'll find some writers who do think it's a good idea.&quot; That was, you know, meeting one. We thought, oh. ♪ ♪ [Joe] You know, I'm driving an hour and a half to get here for this meeting. I pay a lot of money to see her, but the thing is, it's like my whole career is riding on this, you know, this script is really going to determine a lot for me about my life and so, you know, I'm pulling out all the stops. I'm finally to the point where I'm happy with it, and that's why I'm curious to see what Dara has to say because we'll see if she agrees that it's there or not, but if I'm right, then I'll be, you know, days away from sending it out to producers or whatever I do with it, but if I'm wrong and she has a lot of comments, then I'll be back in my office working again. It's a long, arduous road to get from the idea to the finish script, and there are many times when you are, you hit the wall. Why don't I just quit? And there are lots of stories that I have quit, but I guess I can say well those are the stories that I didn't want to tell at that time. This one I've been working on for three years, so I guess there's something in here that I really want to say. It's just hard to dredge it up. - Hello. - Hey, come on in. - I'm Joe Aaron. - How are you? - Hi. - Nice to meet you. So, we meet at last. How are ya? Hey puppies. If you don't mind, we're going to work in the office here. Okay. [Joe] All right. I was hoping you were going to do that. [Dara] I wanted to get this on tape because I'm just so impressed. Oh, good. Just a wonderful, wonderful rewrite. Your writing is just so incredible anyway. I'm a big, big, big fan. There is one area that I still think needs some work. And that area, it's a tough area, it's still is with the protagonist. I just feel like you're still holding back a little bit on your central character. - Okay. - How do you feel about that? That's always a problem of mine. - Uh-huh. - My main guy winds up being kind of like this, you know, boring guy. And I know that, and I fight it. Okay. And I tried to make him more active in this version than nine months ago, but it's, it's, it's an ongoing problem. I'll probably have it with my next story. He's not a weak protagonist, but he's so subtle right now. - Uh-huh. - That he's not giving your story enough strength, enough momentum. This is where you're taking, I'm taking. This is more like a setting. It's in the Ethers. I mean it's not grounded in any time. In the first act, you want to constantly create as much of a sense of urgency as possible. I think the answer is in your rewrite. I'm not... You are so image oriented, I'm not really worried about this, but I would like you to consider as you are rewriting that it is, we, you've got to pause into this. If you're a bricklayer, your raw materials are mortar and sand and water, and you got to mix them all up and make bricks. For a writer, his or her raw materials are their inner world of experience and memory, and they have to risk putting that out there and hoping a brick's going to form. What makes writers so brave is that when it doesn't, they get up the next morning and mix those materials again and hope again that a brick will form. All right. I'm going to try Scott again. - Are we ready? - Yes. I'm on your schedule. This is so cool. People are waiting on me and stuff. There's news apparently on my, on Mask. Mask? Awesome. So, I'm waiting to hear what the news is. It tickles. Does it? - Yeah. - I know. Most guys are like... I figure the first place this will be used is in my hometown newspaper. - You know, the story. - Yeah. - Local boy makes good. - Uh-huh. In the trades. Mask. That's a ways down the road. I'll have you go horseback riding, disco dancing, and table tennis. What am I looking at? I'm supposed to be pretending I'm... Working. Cool. Let's see that one. Let's see the other shirt. Okay. I'm going to try Scott again. - [Scott] Hello. - Hey, there you are. - Hey. - What's up man? - How you doing? - I'm all right. Actually, it's pretty cool. My friend, Jeff, is a photographer, and he's taking some shots of me in case I ever need anything for like a publicity photo. Good. I'm milking this for all it's worth. Good for you, man. You're becoming a celebrity. Yeah, right. Is it all it's cracked up to be? Well, you're the one that's going to make it happen, so... All right. Let me take you back a little bit and then I'll catch you up to now. The last thing that you told me about was you're thinking about going up to Washington to look at the one stop shop. I flew up to Spokane last week. What they said was, &quot;You know, this is a really good screenplay right now, and we want to make it great.&quot; They definitely wanted to, to cut I guess 15, 20 pages out of this thing, and we want you to do a final pass on the script before we really say yes or no. At that point, I was asking you, I was e-mailing back and forth saying can you do this, this weekend? and you were like, I got a lot of stuff... So I was just like fuck it, and I went and I did a final pass on it, and I was actually really pleased. All right. Cool. I think the script is tighter now, and I think it's... Can you send it to me? Can I get a copy of it or... - Absolutely. - Cool. I'll send it to you. I'll e-mail it to you right now. Maybe it's a moot point now, but I have some thoughts on tightening the story and some stuff that I want to address - on Taylor's character... - Cool. So I'd like to see you know, how close you had to what I was probably already thinking. Okay. I think you're going to be really pleased. I'm really psyched. It's awesome. If it's 15 pages shorter, that's great. I just e-mailed it to you. Okay. All right, man. Thanks. I'll talk to you tomorrow. - Okay. Bye. - See ya. All right, well, Scott's taking a pass at shortening the script himself. I'm pretty freaked by that. That's... So it's gone from 120 pages down to 105. Haven't read it yet. That's going to be the first time that I'll have read really anybody doing any sort of editing of my material, so I'm pretty nervous, but you know, his sense so far has been good, and I trust him, so I'm waiting with baited breath to read the shortened script that he's edited. [man] What are you doing right now, Joe? [Joe] Two days ago, I listened to the tape that we made and took notes. Yesterday, I typed up my notes and now I'm actually typing on my script. [man] Is this hard work? This is hard, not like digging a ditch but hard like, like trying to bend a spoon with your mind. I started this about three years ago, and this isn't really that same story. It's the same basic place and same basic people, but it's, it's, the themes evolve and change as I think new thoughts and even now, even today, it's getting, it's getting a little deeper I would say. I just read what I have, and I read what I want to say thematically, and I just move within this space, and I try to make it beautiful. So then the question is, so is it now great? Right this minute, the answer's no. Will it be? Maybe. And if I do it successfully, then the answer is yes. It could be. [James] I mean, I had a screenplay once that was, where I was 90 pages in, and I knew it was all over. I knew it was a disaster, and it was driving me crazy because the studio had gone down the path with me so I, there was no getting out, and I didn't know how to go past these 90 pages, and then it all worked out, and the, the change which made it from absolute despair that there was no way to save it to it all working out was minute, but key. [man] Which screenplay was that? It was Terms of Endearment. Appetizer size. [Deborah] So this is our first premiere. - Did you have a mushroom? - I did not have a mushroom. This is a trailer for the feature When You're Not There. Michael, what do you want? Mushroom? Tell the camera what we're going to watch, Michael. This is everybody efforts, and I'm extremely pleased so I just, you know, I really want to convey how much this means because it really, you know, I just felt very supported when we were doing it, and I just feel like everybody's, everybody's, you know, part of what they did is definitely in there. [television] I've made avoidance into an art. It takes a lot out of me, and pretty much anyone who cares about me. Keith, it's Allan. Are we that toxic? I want to call it fate. I will say it's ironic losing the ring finger on my left hand. I couldn't go through with it. I'm not ambidextrous. [clapping] [Deborah] Okay, so our first offers are to help me with this, Adrian Brody as the brother, Cameron Manheim as Jeanne Tripplehorn. Jane... You know, I don't want to be ridiculous, but I really can't thank you enough because this is really helping me. [man] She's getting the leaks. She was getting the leaks a lot on the set in New York City. [woman] I know. Everybody that's contributed to this has been doing it because they're really into it and it's a tribute because they read the script and like great, I'll do it. [Deborah] Because of, you know, that we're able to go to the people that are now coming back with a much bigger budget and saying, you know, actually be able to say, &quot;Yeah, I'm, I'm going to direct this movie.&quot; [Nora] I moved into directing for a couple of reasons. Most directors I discovered need to be convinced that the screenplay they're going to direct has something to do with them, and this is a tricky thing if you write screenplays where women have parts that are equal to or greater than the male part, and I thought why am I out there looking for directors because you look at a list of directors, it's all boys. It certainly was when I started as a screenwriter, so I thought I'm just going to become a director and that will make it easier. [David] It's going to be interesting to see what he cut and what he changed, but you know, it's necessary to keep the project moving forward so I'm going to try and keep this cool. In the words of Paul Newman, this is why I don't own a gun. The name of the town where the script was set initially when I wrote it was Stillwater, and Scott's opted to change it to Glen Echo, which reminds me a lot more of The Hobbit than it does horror films, so I'm definitely not really crazy about that. I know that Glen Echo is the name of his production company as well, so that's a little bit too close to home I think. Product placement, Toyota Prius makes an appearance in the script for the first time. Let's see if we can get them to sign a check. That seems like a very producer-ish thing to do. Before, it was just an old beat up car that the main character drove kind of a beat up car, but now, it's specifically a Toyota Prius. There's a sense right here, the scene heading or the scene... the scene description, the crew sits in Leslie's Prius outside of Glen Echo's greasy spoon diner. Two strikes. If I'm reacting this strongly to Scott changing the name of the town, I don't know how I'm going to react to some board of development executives changing entire characters and plot points. That's going to be an eye opener. There's something here that's probably what's going to trouble me the most, and that I'm going to have to have a conversation with Scott about. This is something that's been sort of a minor point of contention for both of us sort of since the beginning, and there's a big scene here now, and actually turns slightly into this, there's like a remark about whether the character's pro-life or pro-choice. I do feel like this is not the time or the place or the venue to sort of be launching little remarks like that, so I need to clarify, I need to have Scott clarify to me what exactly he feels the relevance of this particular scene is. That's pretty significant. I'm a little wary of that. I'd hate to see this whole project get scuttled because Scott and I have some sort of political difference. [Carrie] Mostly, you write a script and someone's going to rewrite you. They get hundreds of them, but they get 10 writers to write something. If you have a big budget, you can go and get a lot of people to write on a script, so nothing's sacred. I just actually heard that somebody said, &quot;Your screenplay got bought and now someone like Carrie Fisher will come in and rewrite you.&quot; I felt terrible, you know, because that, that's not what I mean to do. [Carrie] My idea was never to raid something and trash it, you know. That's more work for me. I got her music that we talked about. Uh-huh. And that's it. All right. Okay. Okay, sweetie. Let's start with... [singing] [Joe] You know, some days, some weeks I've put a script aside for an entire week and don't look at it, and this week I've been working on it six and seven hours a day every day. [Joe] At music today with Lex, I was reading what I had written. I didn't even finish it, but I read about 50 pages, and they're good. [singing] I thought by now I would have, I'd been done. I'm still wrestling with the story. [Joe] Earlier draft, maybe one of the first drafts, it worked for me. I want it to work for other people, so I had people read it. I did rewrites. It got to the point where I felt like I was writing it for other people, but this rewrite, which I hope is the final draft, it's getting back to my draft. It's getting back to pleasing me again. We're gonna call mommy and see if we're going to meet her, and then we're going to go have pizza, yes? [singing] Oh, wait a minute. What's here? - It smells good. - Yeah. [Joe] One of the things about writing this very hard is finding the time to do it, and I think the difference between people who do it and the ones who don't are the ones who do it commit to it, and what that means is, is that you're getting your writing done and everything else isn't getting done. In about a week I would say, I'm going to have another draft for you. Would you read it again? - Yeah. - Good, yeah. I mean, you've written a lot of drafts. I know. It's just getting better and better. [Joe] It's tough on your family because they're not on your schedule. You know what I'm saying? It's not a normal, it's not a normal way to live. It's not a normal schedule, and like I'll be up 'til two in the morning and then I'll sleep in some days or I won't take out the garbage for two weeks and then I'll take it out plus do yard work the next, and stuff, you know, I'll go above and beyond the call of duty. It can be the source of arguments, but if you give into all that and you stop writing, that's when nothing ever gets done. We're trying, you know I'm trying to get Terry Hatcher to read my story, right? - No. - No. [Dennis] A writer's life and the writer's struggle can be really hard on relationships, very hard for your mate to understand your ups and downs, the fact that you're spending all of these hours doing something that doesn't seem to have a tangible reward, not to mention the financial strain because for most writers, the have to take day jobs that don't bring in the kind of money and security that they or their mate would want, particularly if children start coming into the equation. I was saying this morning, I sort of feel like it's bring your kid to work day. Normally a writer is not in the room for the casting. Hey, where do you want me to sit? Where's, where's the most out of the way place? Well, Ned will probably sit here to read, and Al sat here yesterday. Okay. And Hart's camera is going to be there. So, Marissa might want to sit next to Matt, and you might want to sit here. I'll go in the corner. You got it. [David] We're going to be having casting for the roles of Leslie and for Taylor. Leslie is the male lead of the film. He's the sort of up and coming psycho slasher killer in the same vein as Michael Meyers or Jason Voorhees or Freddy Krueger, and then Taylor is the female lead. She is a grad student documentarian who is following Leslie in this pursuit of this goal that he's trying to establish himself in the ranks of these killers. Okay. Everybody ready? How do you want to do this? [man] Trust Taylor, where is it? Trust? Right. Where is it coming from you? Who's Doc Halloran by the way? Who is he really? Who are you, while we're at it? [man] I'm not having this conversation in the street. [Carmen] Why? Because you're afraid he's gonna come shooting at you again? [man] Get in the van. [Carmen] You ever been to Reno, Leslie? [man] That's enough. That's great. [man] Trust Taylor, where is it? Trust? Right, Leslie. You know what? Where is it coming from you? Who's Doc Halloran, Leslie? You know what? Who are you actually? [man] I'm not having this conversation in the street. [Sarah] You afraid he's gonna show up and shoot you again? [man] Get in the van. - You ever been to Reno, Leslie? - That's enough. [David] I'm starting to believe in spite of myself that it might actually happen, that it might go and maybe I'm setting myself up for disaster there. I usually try and be pretty cautiously optimistic. She's wonderful. She's got potential to be a survivor girl. [man] You keep saying that. What's a survivor girl? Sorry. It's a industry term. We call a girl like her who's, you know, with the potential to make you kind of walk away from me at the end, you know? [Sean] First you ID her, and then you see if she's got the right group of friends around her. [man] What is it about this girl? Well, she's a virgin. [man] How does it feel when you see actors reading your lines? When it, when it's done, when it's done right, when things are working, it, it's the most satisfying thing you can possibly imagine. We've written some really off the wall things and so when you see that come on the screen or come into play on the set with the actors, you can say, &quot;Oh my God.&quot; Oh my God. We got a guy playing Jerry Falwell - delivering our lines. - Yeah. - What a strange concept. - Yeah, yeah. So it gives you a total kick. Right now as I wake up this morning and start cleaning because to stave off the anxiety of basically waiting now on two, you know, these are two jobs that are, there our jobs. One is an action adventure kind of thing, one is like a girl buddy script. Both of these would be extremely helpful right now in terms of money and just having a little bit like breathing space while these other things, you know, come together. I have never been happier. I've never been more miserable at the same time. You can start to doubt everything, and you can start to begrudge everything. That's my main job right now is doing what I have to do to keep things moving, but mostly it's just controlling my own negativity and doubt. I think the thing that separates more successful writers from less successful writers, the most important thing is the perseverance. There are a lot of people who are lucky. There are a lot of people who are born with connections or have the kind of personality that easily makes them, but if you don't have that, you have to keep pushing. You have to keep generating ideas. You have to not take rejection personally because almost everything you come up with will be rejected, and even the scripts that eventually sell will probably have been turned down by a number of people first, so you're constantly hearing no and in the face of that, you have to, you have to persevere. [man] Where are you going? I'm going to go to my friend, Jeff's. He read an earlier draft and now he's read another updated draft, and I want to see what he says about the latest version. [man] Is that helpful? Yeah. You know, I tend to write in my head and all my characters seem to be in their head. He's one of these guys who likes to draw out the action and so it challenges me to, you know, to make it better. [Jeff] The first time around everybody was a little wiser than they needed to be. You know what I mean? For 13, she was revealing too much wisdom for a 13-year-old and I think once you transferred that from wordiness to action, then you solved a lot of those problems. Like I have three that I'd like to show more than. But a good well written monologue in the hands of a really great actor and if you don't overdo it, you don't have 50,000 monologues once in awhile, I think it could be very powerful so... It's nice to hear his comments that it's getting better, you know, like I keep, like I get this sinking feeling that sometimes I, I'm rewriting. It gets, it's bad, it gets good, it gets better and then it starts getting bad again, but that that doesn't seem to be happening. He seems to like it, and I had a meeting yesterday with another reader, and she liked it so I think I'm on the right path so, we'll see. Now I'm off to get my daughter. ♪ ♪ [David] This is the first curve ball I'm going to throw at you. I'm seriously right now, seriously debating whether I should leave AKA. - [Scott] Really? - [David] Yeah. I'm really debating right now is the time for me to say... [Scott] You got balls of steel, buddy. The money I'll get paid on Mask, I'll be able to live and, you know, I'll be able to live comfortably for three to four, five months. Now, what does comfortably mean to you? Lap dances on Thursday through Saturday, okay? And chopped Ramen the rest of the week. And eating out in restaurants Monday through Thursday. No. Continuing the way I'm living right now. I'm paying my bills, doing what I got to do, but then I free up Monday through Friday - essentially to write. - With all due respect... Yeah. I can tell you're filled with respect. You're a complete imbecile if you... See, those are respectful words. That's very respectfully presented. - And you cannot... - You're absolutely right. So here's the deal. You're going to go up there and be a PA, be running for stuff when you could be, listen, the thing is... No. I got to cut you off because... Don't mistake your first film for your most important film. Right, but here's, there are two critical bits of information that I think you need to know which is, actually there are three, one... I'm a Pisces, no. And frankly you're not that good in bed from what I've been told. [Scott] Go ahead, I'm sorry. [David] Let me give you the rest of the background information. [Scott] Okay. [David] Wendy and I are no longer working together. I feel that I'm progressing more rapidly in my writing career than she would be able to in a literary management sense. I've signed with Joanie Bernstein. [Scott] You have a manager? [David] Yeah, and it's Joanie Bernstein, which is a thousand fold better than where I was previously. And we can send a copy to your attorney, Mitch, as well. [David] For Joanie to be repping me, Joanie is essentially saying this is a woman who can get people on the phone at will. She's already set me up with an entertainment attorney, so I have that. What do you mean? As a date? She's smoking hot. Okay. I understand. No, actually, there's more because now on top of that, so she has been, Joanie's saying get me your next script as soon as you can. I think you're, it's a great time for you because you sold a script and it's being made, going into production. That kind of makes it interesting, right? I mean, I'm leaping, I'm not leaping without a net. Yeah, I know. This is great. This is very exciting. - All right. - Moving forward. Okay. I'm going to grab one more donut. Yes. Please. Take the box. People throw around the term, you know, you're a player in the game, stuff like that. You hear that a lot, but I don't know. I kind of, I get it. You know, I sort of start to see it, the, it's a cool feeling to be alert to the fact that I'm in a different sort of realm now. I have, for all intents and purposes, a pretty high powered manager, pretty high powered attorney. These are all people that are working on my career behind the scenes and bringing a lot of weight to bear on making it work, and that feels great. ♪ ♪ Come here. I want to make sure they're done. Okay. Wait one second, one second. Back up. Here. Can you do it, can you do it, can you do it? I look at writing as my opportunity or my obligation to say what I have to say. For example, like a parent has a big impact on one person, whereas an artist like a filmmaker can touch millions of people over time, and of course I'm more than one. I'm a parent and an artist, so I get really annoyed when I hear filmmakers and/or writers talk about they don't take any responsibility for what they write. Hey, I'm just a writer or I'm just a filmmaker or, it's just entertainment, why, you know, they say just, just, they say what they are and they put the word just, I'm just this. No. Not just. You're supposed to be the visionary for this world. You've got film which touches millions of people. You've got this power and you're just pissing it away on just. There's so much more to it. There's so much more potential that this medium has and I want to be a part of that. I got a phone call quite recently from somebody who said, &quot;I saw that picture you did with Christopher Plummer and Timothy Dalton. It's a good little movie. Now, I think instead of little drama, I know you're trying to show you've got acting chops. I want you to go back to what made you a big giant action movie, and I have one, you say the word, you rewrite the script, you're the director. You got a $50 million budget. It's right up your alley.&quot; I'll say, &quot;What is it?&quot; It's not Die Hard on a boat. It's not Die Hard in a shopping mall. It's a fresh idea. It's Die Hard , but in a building, and we had come full circle. [David] We finally had a phone conversation a couple days ago in which we, you know, we addressed it, and I expressed my concerns about, you know, how involved I was going to be, and you know, I want to go to the set. I want to be on set, and you know, he took as hard a line as he needed to, and he pretty much point blank reminded me that there is a context that I got to take the check and shut up. Scott felt his contribution to the script warranted a co-written by credit. That was pretty tough for me to give up just because that's, I sort of felt like the written by credit was the only really tangible thing that I had contributed to the entire process. It was my baby, but Scott felt very strongly about his contribution. It was kind of a bitter pill for me to swallow to say, all right, you know, it'll be co-written by David Stieve and Scott Glosserman. Right now, it's 6:30 in the morning. I'm just getting ready to fly out of Burbank to go up to Portland for a week to be on the set of Behind the Mask. The decision that I've reached finally is that it is not the time for me right now to leave AKA permanently. I'm learning as I go, and it's become pretty clear to me that now is not the time for me to leave. The $20,000 that I got paid for the script, you know, once I've paid tax and commission and you know, some other bills and things that I wanted to pay, which is great, that's not enough money to live on. Luckily, we are able to work out a way that I can leave for a week. [man] Are writers welcome on set? [Steven] I would say writers are not welcome on the set more often than not. I mean, the main reason you don't want a writer on the set is supposedly because you feel the writer will like start to get agitated and make little squeaky noises like a porpoise because the director is discarding dialogue or the actors are ad libbing. The real reason I think is that a lot of directors don't want someone sitting around that the actors could go up and talk to about changing their dialogue or what's my motivation. There's a great director who directed a picture that I wrote and who barred me from the set quite appropriately, and said, &quot;I'm sorry, Jim, when you're directing, you don't need to know everything, you need the illusion that you do&quot;, and you know, and I would be there, behind him trying to signal the actors in a way I wasn't even aware of. [Deborah] This is going to be one of those things where we're going to definitely want to drink very soon. You can navigate. I have a little of... What do you have? I have vodka, and I have rum, and I have tequila. No, no tequila. Should we have that before our four o'clock phone call? Yeah. We have an hour to sober up. - Okay. - Okay. - We're all here, yeah? - Hello. Okay, good. Hi. How are you guys doing? The reality is that the people that we're going to for money, if we say wait two more weeks and we think we can get Adrian Brody, you know, and that means we can't shoot 'til April or May, they will say, great, let's wait. I mean, the people who stand to make their money back will always want to push, you know. The unfortunate scenario is that you lose people because you can't give them firm dates. This is the kind of stuff that you do when you're just like panicking, which is apply for jobs that you're so overqualified for it's ridiculous and then have them write back with this form letter saying, &quot;We appreciate your interest; however, we are looking for people who are moronic and have no skills whatsoever, and want to do it for free.&quot; I feel like our smartest strategy is to come up with the, another list, you know, of our second choices while we continue, you know, to gently prod, you know, an Adrian Brody and their, you know, ilk of people, have that second list of people that were on to. As long as something's happening every day, you can keep your energy up and your buoyancy and your optimism, and then, you know, of course, there's these little chinks in the armor which are like, you know, if we're not doing this movie in March, then we all better get jobs or something, you know, like what are we going to do? Okay. I'm just going to put cast around two. Allen. I don't know. I just get so... Come on. Up beat. Oh yeah, right, up beat. Positive. There's a sort of cultural stereotype about artists that's tormented and bitter. I think what's remarkable is how many writers are not, that even when they fall prey to depression or despair, the moment they have a good idea, they're back typing again. The thing that's so wonderful about the creative life is that it feeds you. You don't just feed it. [Dennis] Most writers go through fairly significant periods of despair and depression, and when they can re-engage with their creative muse, that tends to lift them out. Okay. Got a movie. Now, I can say I'm done. This now I'm happy to show. I will show it to anybody. This is the final script. It took a long time to get there though. ♪ ♪ Hi. I see you made it. I made it. Are you Alley? - Hi, I'm Joe. - Nice to meet you. - This is Denise. - Hi, Denise. Hi, Joe. Nice to meet you. [Joe] I'm hoping to do a read with actors, table read with actors because I feel like it will help me. I want it for two reasons. One is to make the script better, and the other is for business reasons. I'm hoping maybe it'll lead to something. She's comforting herself. She's comforting herself. That's really... Okay. Because there's no, no baby there. No, I know, I know, but I thought maybe like out of nervous habit or something... You know how Lady MacBeth kept washing her hands, sort of like that, although she was like sleep walking and she's not, but you understand what I'm saying? It's kind of like guilt is really what it is. In other words... [Joe] I really just want to hear if it works. Does the story work? I've been working on this story for so long that I feel like I had gotten to where I had lost my objectivity. It was 1979 in Mercy, Tennessee. I was 17 years old, well under the age of accountability and on my way to becoming a man. I was on my own and was anxious about the future and finding my place. [woman] Oh shit! Who are you? I'm just, can I help you? I didn't mean to scare you. I was just cold, so I came in here. You in trouble? I'd like to help. I'm sorry. Wait. What's your name? Wait! Too late. Red watches her stumble back to her trailer. Red can only stare at her, pull back revealed a box she was struggling to open. Strychnine, keep out. [Joe] Now, I'm confident to pursue the script. I can send it to agents. I can send it to producers. It's ready now. I have a, I have a backdoor way to get to Tacoma. All right! Another way, and so I don't have the script to her, but I have, she knows about me and yet and... So I think I need, I'd like to have two. Okay. Well, that's easy. [Joe] I think Michael should be able to find somebody. Hey, Treat, it's Rebecca. How are you doing? I hope you guys had a nice Thanksgiving. Hey, I'm just checking back with you. It's presently Thursday at about 11:30 in the morning here. Let me see where she is. Let's start at work. I've got a friend's script that's just fabulous, and we want to send it to you to look at. He... okay. Hey, how are you? It's Rebecca. Hey, just wondering, you know that script Rattled that a friend of mine sent to you, just wondered if you were able to pass it on to your dad yet? Uh-huh. [man] I know this is naïve, but if there's a God, why would he allow that? What reason could there... Don't, okay, don't even say it. You start thinking like that and you just, you can't let those thoughts overwhelm you if you think too much, if you question everything you thought you knew and you realize it's just, it's just not real and you have no worth. You have no worth. This is, this is the best thing I've ever written, so if this isn't good enough or if this isn't what they're looking for, then that's it. That's all I got. Anything else I write after this is, it will be either as good or not as good. In my opinion. Exterior mountain day. The van drives off the bridge onto the dirt road. That's when I noticed the morning sun. [woman] Tilt up past the lone mountain higher still. That's when I noticed the miracle of a brand new day. The sun glows bright until everything in sight is light. Fade out. [man] And what's your goal now for the, in terms of seeing your script realized now? [Joe] I'd like to get five named actresses attached to the five main roles. I'd like to get a few million dollars, you know, not a kazillion, but I don't know five or ten million dollars to make a low budget movie. I'd like it to be released theatrically and then I'd like for whoever gave me the money to give me enough creative control, in other words, kind of leave me alone. I wonder what I'm supposed to do in this room like a far as cleaning up. I have no, I wasn't told what to do. I'm just going to get my stuff and get out of here. ♪ ♪ [David] My goal to be on the set in Portland is just to be under Scott's feet and annoy the hell out of him as much as I possibly can. No. It's a unique opportunity for me as a writer to be able to contribute on the set. Right now, I'm going out to try to catch up with Scott and the rest of the production team. They're on a technical scout so I can see where some of the scenes are going to be taking place and, you know, get a better sense of the actual locations and I find myself driving around in a rented car in Portland trying to find a production staff that's highly mobile. I think that was my turn right there. Hey, man, I'm on my way, and Roger gave me directions to the Vista Lookout. This is a community called Troutdale, and it's actually going to be the street that's going to become Glen Echo, which I think is pretty cool, so I give you Glen Echo, USA. This is just really cool the way it's set up. It looks like a movie set. It looks like something off the Universal lot almost. It's going to become a movie town. [man] Are they going to block off the street? Yes, they will. Barbershop there. Yeah, they'll block off the street and... - We've got some shots. - That's awesome. Hey. How are you? Got some good stuff? - Yeah, man. - Good. This is going to be close. Whatever. Our first shot is Main Street, walking into Glen Echo or is there something else evil lurking underneath, okay? All right. So we're going to have, Taylor is going to be sort of across the street, and she's going to be speaking to us. Our camera will be here. She'll be looking. We're going to have a close up of Taylor. She'll walk down the sidewalk, and we're going to come out wide to probably, you know, we'll come out wide, and we're going to see the hill with the bluff first shot, so we have all of this. - Right. - No, no, no. We're going, up there, see that bluff right there. - Yeah. - That's where we were. Right. We're 15 feet away, and we shoot Leslie on the bluff looking out, and then we pick up another shot of Leslie and he comes down, we start here, and we go over, and we go over and we do a dirty shot, and he's overlooking the town. It's amazing. Wow. [David] It's become apparent, because of budget constraints, that we need to rewrite the script to fit the sets and the locations, not vise versa. We can't build a town. We can't create a barn silo, you know, things like that, so the script needs to be rewritten to fit what they have available to shoot with so... Do you know what breakdowns are? Okay. On the breakdown, there will be a synopsis of the movie. [David] To be able to sort of be following Scott around and, you know, him asking me for feedback on stuff or being able to look over people's shoulders and see things, this is not something I'm going to get to experience again, not like I said, not unless it's a project [phone ringing] that I'm involved with. Hold that thought. This is David. Hey, Jared. Good. How are you? Really? That's good to hear. Okay. Page 68. Okay. I'm there. Okay. Okay. So, right. When Leslie impales her on the hay hooks, does he then impale her again? I don't know. I've been thinking about that, and I don't know that it's a little redundant. From the creative perspective, I would, I guess I sort of thought that if Leslie's going to hang Kelly, it's Lauren. If he's going to impale Lauren on the hay hooks and then hang her from the, sort of the hay bale lift, then I think if he then wraps the rope around Shane and hangs him, you have a balance that both bodies are going to hang, right? But, I don't, not even practically, I don't know, whatever is more logistically possible, I guess. Well, no, but here's the thing I'm going to tell you is that I mean I, you and Scott are both going to freaking flip out on me and go ballistic because I, I mean, there's a lot of changes that, you know, in this October 28th draft, and then Scott, I already know I'm going to get yelled at. Scott's going to totally bust me because I tried to sneak in a couple of lines of dialogue change here and there. He's going, he's going to go ballistic on me. I just know it, but all right. Now, what time are we going tomorrow? So, it's eight o'clock? Nine o'clock. Oh, good. That's better. Okay. All right. I'll talk to you later. Wow. I've just been given more homework. I have gone to the set and you're kind of around in this, it's kind of combat writing when you do rewriting and stuff, and it's, I feel like it's a form of ambulance chasing or, you know, recently I did this kind of, where you go, oh my God, it's bleeding from the second act! Quick, quick, give me a suture! Get me the paddles! The third act is having a heart attack! The star is coming! The star is coming. It's just this incredibly intense process. How you doing? You ready to fight over script? Yes, definitely. All right. Okay. We got to have a fight about the pro-life, pro-choice thing. I don't know why you feel... You can't do that. - Why can't I do it? - It's not fair. He's not pro-life. He's not, that's not the point. It's not about that. But it's such a divisive political thing. I don't know why you want this in the film. [Scott] You got to trust me on this one. She's... You want, should we put something in, I could work something in about stem cell research or you know, prayer in schools if you want to work that in there as well. You're, first of all, you've got this like hang up on the feminist, on the whole thing, oh my God, you're offending women. My point is that, my point is that there's simply no place for discussion of pro-life or pro-choice in your movie. So he would contradict himself if he said he's pro-choice, and there's no way he's pro-life, so rather than be trapped, he's going to say, &quot;Personal choice. You got me. I'm going to take the fifth on that. I'm guilty&quot;, as opposed to saying... Can he say, &quot;I'm going to take the fifth&quot; or is that too vague for you? Fine. I'll take the fifth. I think that's... That's, it's more in line with his personality. It's coming up to the other end of this conversation. This is so not what, this is so what I didn't want to have happen. Why? This is good. We just worked it out. Okay. There have been some pretty rocky moments with Scott and I, and he'll, I'm sure he'll be the one to tell you the same thing. It's, we're both really passionate about the project. We both really have a very clear vision of it. We don't have the same vision of it, and that's fine. [David] I'm lucky to be working with Scott on this. I don't say that, you know there's no points for me to win anymore. This thing is a script I'm about to turn over to him, and trust his vision of it, but I'm lucky that I've had the relationship that I have with him, ups and downs, to get the script to where it is right now. [laughing] That would be genius. You see what I'm saying? [Dennis] One of the hardest things for a screenwriter is to give up control of their material, of the screenplay because a screenplay, no matter how beautifully written, is not the end product. The end product is a film, and it's really hard for screenwriters to have to hand that over. [chanting] There were two rewrite jobs that I was up for. One of them definitively is not happening as of this week. They're just not doing the project. The other one I'm a little bit attached to because it's got a kind of feeling of something that I might actually really be excited about writing. [man] If you are forced to look for another kind of job, what... - What would that job be? - Exactly. [Deborah] It's a good question because honestly it's not even, I don't know. I want to remain slightly hopeful, slightly hopeful, cautiously optimistic until the last possible second because, you know, if I have to, I'll go work at Starbucks, you know, I'm unemployed. At this point, the way it feels, the way it would feel to pull out of the movie in order to do something else, I might as well do that because it's, nothing's going to make me feel good. Obviously, if I get another writing job, I'll be delighted, but, because that will always help me, but you know, we're talking worst, worst case scenario. No writing job, no movie, you know, despair. [man] Why do you write? [Deborah] There isn't any other time that I feel completely human. There is a place in my own self that, that starves if I don't write. [man] Realism's all about self-realization, right, is that part of the reason why you're a writer? [Deborah] The founder of this Buddhism, in the Buddhism I practice was a 12th century priest who wrote many, many letters to people who were practicing his form of Buddhism. When you read those letters, you know today, they're talking about the same problems, you know. You read them and you feel like he's writing to you but also you read them and you see how powerful, you know, just the words that really come from someone's life, you know, and I really get... because it's one of those mornings, but I'm also kind of prone to crying whether I'm happy or sad or, you know, but it's just, even just talking about that really, I think it's one of the most important things you can do, no matter what you're writing because every time you write something, you're literally making an inner vow. I don't think we think about it because we take in so much information but writing is never going away. Why would anyone keep going? Well, they keep going because they either believe in what they have to say or they have a need to have what they have to say heard, and they believe that this is a way to get it heard, and so they keep going. [Joe] When you finally get to the end where you're happy with it and you see what it says and what it did for you, then you realize, ah yes, it was worth it. I wasn't sure it was worth it, but now I can see, okay, yes. It took a long time, but it was worth it. Come up here. [beatboxing] I can't really stand movies anymore I have to say because when I go see a movie, what I see are people's first drafts, first and second drafts, and I can, you know, not everybody sees that, but what I see is writers who didn't do this much work. I see, I see... phoning it in, and it drives me insane because I'm out here working, and there are people who do what I do. I mean, I'm not the only one, but it's like why aren't the scripts that are worked and are tended to and well written, why aren't those the ones that are getting made and putting millions of dollars into? Ready to go? Let's go. Over here. When you go to a movie, it should be something great. It should be something better than you could knock off over a weekend, you know, and if it's not great, then why isn't it great? Because there's people who are great, so why are you producing these people's crap when you've got great people, you know, little offices like this all over L.A. not to mention the whole world? Yes, it drives me insane. I think that it's very easy to kind of give it away, give the definition of success away, empower other people in determining whether or not you have talent, and here's the catch-22. The more you do that, the less you'll be able to write. That's the hard thing because writing is all about preservation and strength and authority in your own voice. If you give that voice away by guessing what you think or what you think or what you think as you go, you're going to have less to say and less to be able to write about and less of an authoritative voice, and then it goes away. [man] What is the production staff doing today? The production staff today is out in the field scouting locations for some of the scenes to actually physically get a lay of the land. Essentially, it's a technical rehearsal for the crew. - Aaron, you been in here? - No. - It's really men of honor. - Oh really? Except we're using the better court room. Yeah. ♪ ♪ [David] This is so cool. There's, we're in the courthouse now, and I'm overwhelmed by the, it's the people that are doing all the stuff they're doing. There's a sound guy in the mix. We have a stunt coordinator walking around somewhere, and then the director and the DP are talking about how this is going to look in the courthouse. Because you've just gone straight that way, and now you want to go straight this way? That's the whole point of it. It's symmetry. It's vertical. It's whoosh. It's just unbelievable to me that I'm sitting in a courthouse in Portland first of all but that it's so close to what I want for the script, and there's all these professional people doing their thing. This is the coolest job in the world. The truth is that the writer is one of the people who writes a movie. The cinematographer writes the movie also in pictures. The composer writes the movie in music. All right. We probably need to move. A movie is, as I always say, the screenplay is the big plain pizza, the one with tomatoes and cheese and then the director comes in and puts a lot, and says, you know it needs mushrooms, and you go, put mushrooms on it, and then the costume designer throws peppers on, and pretty soon you have a pizza with everything and sometimes it's the greatest pizza of your life and sometimes you think that was a mistake, we should've left it with only the mushrooms. [David] How about this for a creepy old farm house? So guys, this is our location for 13 of our 24 days. - Let's start in the house. - Start in the house, okay. We're going in. Careful of the wire. Watch that front step, you guys. Wow. Okay. So let me take you through here and this is great, and everything is, look at this, look at this. All the lights in the house go off. This is pitch black. Okay, when the lights come back on, he's already got the pitchfork sticking out, like this, and the pitchfork gets retracted. So the pitchfork's already sticking in, lights go on and he's like oh my God, and then it gets retracted and he falls, revealing Leslie right here and Lauren is freaking out, and now we have a reverse shot, and Lauren's backing up, and she runs this way and she goes up the stairs. [Scott] This right here is the staging area, so this is where they theoretically throw in a ladder up here, and they're going to climb in through this window, like more on an angle actually, like right about there, and you're going to love this shot, man. [Scott] All right. I think you're right. I think it is more natural this way. I hate having these things in my head for two years, then... [man] It can be the other way. [Scott] No because this is, this is the way it would look. To be out here and to be walking around on an actual farm to see these abstract ideas come to life in a concrete tangible way, it's unlike anything I ever would have realistically expected. Principle photography has been pushed back one week. Unfortunately, that means I'm not going to get to see any actors actually delivering lines, but that's okay. [Scott] She'd be looking, say she's looking at herself in a mirror, you know, like she's just so psyched. - She looks at this. - [man] Totally. Well, we can do that. Like I said, that's... This is so awesome. We have so much good shit in there. - It looks so cool. - Dude, why didn't you tell me that the dog is actually black? That's how I wrote the script.
