INSTEAD, PEOPLE ACTUALLY GO TO LOCATIONS WHERE THE PLANTS ARE COMMONLY PHOTOGRAPHED -- THE EXACT SAME ONES. THERE'S PROBABLY, LIKE, HARD DRIVES AND HARD DRIVES JUST FILLED WITH, LIKE, ALL THE BOTANICAL GARDENS ACROSS THE UNITED STATES WITH THE SAME GODDAMN PLANTS, YEAR AFTER YEAR, WHEN THEY'RE BLOOMING AND DYING. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? IT'S RIDICULOUS. SO, YOU KNOW, AT THE END OF THE DAY, YOU KNOW, DOING THAT KIND OF THING IS EASY. AND YOU KNOW, PULLING TOGETHER THE RESOURCES, YOU KNOW, TO GET A CREW TOGETHER, GET MAKEUP TEAMS TOGETHER, TO GET EVERYBODY ALL IN ON THE GAME, YOU KNOW, TO RE-CREATE AN INTERESTING -- MAYBE IT'S A CRIME SCENE, MAYBE IT'S, LIKE, A KIDNAPPING SCENE, MAYBE IT'S, LIKE, SOME SORT OF, LIKE, WEIRD SEX CRIME GONE WRONG KIND OF THING IN THE MIDST OF IT. YOU KNOW, WHATEVER IT IS, YOU'RE ACTUALLY MAKING SOMETHING INTERESTING HAPPEN, EVEN IF IT IS DARK OR WHATEVER. AND THAT'S JUST WAY MORE INTERESTING THAN, YOU KNOW, JUST GOING OUT AND TAKING A PICTURE OF YOUR FUCKING TREE IN YOUR FRONT YARD OR SOMETHING. YOU KNOW? I THINK PHOTOS OF FLOWERS ARE NICE. [ SIGHS ] I LIKE LOOKING AT PHOTOS. YOU KNOW, I'M SURE THAT THERE'S PHOTOS OF FLOWERS OUT THERE THAT'LL JUST BLOW MY MIND, YOU KNOW? I JUST HAVEN'T SEEN THEM. ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, WELL, WHY WOMEN? WHY IS IT ALL THOSE DEAD WOMEN? WHY NOT SOME DEAD OLD GUY WITH, LIKE, A -- WELL, THAT'S DEPRESSING, YOU KNOW? IT'S NOT ABOUT THEM BEING DEAD OR BEAT UP OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT, YOU KNOW. IT'S JUST A SPICE. ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW WHAT, IT'S RIDICULOUS FOR ME TO EVEN TRY TO EXPLAIN THIS, BECAUSE IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT I EVEN THINK ABOUT. IT'S JUST SOMETHING THAT I DO. AND THAT'S WHAT YOU GOT TO DO IN THESE SITUATIONS. YOU CAN'T SAY, "WHY AM I DOING THIS?" YOU KNOW, "WHY, WHY, WHY?" YOU JUST HAVE TO BE LIKE, "OKAY, I'M ATTRACTED TO THIS, YOU KNOW, AND THAT'S WHAT I'M GONNA DO." AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH WHAT PHOTOGRAPHY, IN GENERAL, IS. YOU KNOW? YOU JUST HAVE TO REACT TO SOMETHING THAT GIVES YOU SOME SORT OF, YOU KNOW, SOME SORT OF, UH, YOU KNOW, EMOTIONAL FEEDBACK THAT YOU CAN'T QUITE EXPLAIN. YOU KNOW, I DON'T -- I DON'T LIKE LOOKING AT DEAD BODIES. I DON'T LIKE -- I DON'T LIKE SEEING PEOPLE ACTUALLY GET HURT. YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT LIKE THAT AT ALL. HAVE YOU EVER SEEN A REAL DEAD BODY? UM... I MEAN, LIKE, AT A FUNERAL, NOT, LIKE, JUST WALKING AROUND AND STUMBLE ACROSS ONE, ALTHOUGH I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE KIND OF COOL. [ SIGHS ] YOU KNOW WHAT MIGHT BE A GOOD FIX FOR YOU? WHAT'S THAT? [ SNIFFLES ] HAVE YOU JUST TRIED, YOU KNOW, SMILING OCCASIONALLY? YOU KNOW? I SMILE, I SMILE. LIKE, UM -- LET ME SEE. I'M NOT -- THERE'S NOTHING TO SMILE ABOUT RIGHT NOW. I'M NOT GONNA SMILE RIGHT NOW. WELL, SEE, THAT'S THE THING, IS YOU DON'T NEED ANYTHING TO SMILE ABOUT. YOU CAN JUST SMILE. YOU KNOW? WELL, WHAT IS THAT? WHAT'S THE BENEFIT OF THAT? WELL, IT RELEASES ENDORPHINS OR SOMETHING. I DON'T KNOW. UH, YOU KNOW, YOU SMILE, YOU FEEL GOOD. YOU KNOW? AND IF YOU DON'T FEEL GOOD, I THINK IF YOU GET INTO THE HABIT OF SMILING, YOU CAN START. I THINK YOU SHOULD JUST, YOU KNOW, START PRACTICING SMILING, PERSONALLY. [ CHUCKLES ] IT'S THE DUMBEST THING I'VE EVER HEARD. [ CHUCKLES ] COMING FROM MR. MOPEY OVER HERE.

I DON'T MEAN TO SUGGEST THAT YOUR LIFE IS NOT INTERESTING. I ALSO DON'T MEAN TO SUGGEST THAT THE TRUTH CAN'T BE INTERESTING. I JUST THINK, YOU KNOW, A MEMOIR WHERE THE NARRATOR, OUR -- OUR, YOU KNOW, HERO ENDS UP SHOOTING AN UNARMED WOMAN AND BEING SUSPENDED, AND THE MURDER THAT SAID HERO IS TRYING TO SOLVE, YOU KNOW, TWO OF THEM END UP BEING RELATED, AND A THIRD ENDS UP BEING UNRELATED, I MEAN, THESE ARE JUST THE KIND OF THINGS THAT HAPPEN IN REAL LIFE BUT THAT DON'T NECESSARILY MAKE FOR COMPELLING, UH, YOU KNOW, COMMERCIAL, UH, BOOKS. YEAH, I-I CAN SEE THAT. AND I THINK IF WE CAN JUST LIBERATE YOU FROM THE FACTS OF THE CASE AND SORT OF FREE YOU UP TO TIE UP SOME OF THESE LOOSE ENDS AND STRENGTHEN THESE CONNECTIONS -- YOU AND THE PHOTOGRAPHER, FOR INSTANCE -- YOU COULD STRENGTHEN UP THE -- THE KIND OF PARALLELS THAT YOU SEEM TO BE SUGGESTING HERE, UM, AND -- AND YOU KNOW, REALLY TIE THESE TWO TOGETHER IN SOME KIND OF COHESIVE, COMPELLING WAY. YEAH. THAT'S A GOOD IDEA. I'LL, UM, I'LL THINK ABOUT THAT. WHAT'S UP WITH THIS PHOTOGRAPHER? WHAT'S THIS GUY UP TO? BILLY? HE'S GOOD. IS THIS ALL RIGHT? YEAH. MY TAN LINE LOOKS KIND OF WEIRD, BUT...
