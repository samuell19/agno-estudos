Kleinman! Kleinman, open up. - Kleinman! - We know you're in there. - Kleinman! - You bastard! Open the door. Kleinman! Come on, Kleinman. Kleinman! I'm coming, I'm coming. - Kleinman! - Kleinman, come on. - What? - For God's sake, Kleinman, are you deaf? What do you mean, deaf? What's, what's... What's going on? - We need you to get dressed. - Get dressed? Why? Don't play ignorant. I was playing ignorant? I was in a deep sleep. - We expect the killer to strike again tonight. - The killer? What killer? The strangler. - What strangler? - The maniac. The one who killed Eisler's son and choked Jensen to death with the piano wire. Jenson? The big night watchman? That's right. Took him from behind. Crept up, got him by the throat. He was blue when we found him. Saliva frozen down the corner of his mouth. Well, look, I've got to be up early tomorrow for work, so... Don't play dumb, Kleinman. You live on an island? Tonight's a foggy night. He always strikes in the fog. Yeah, but, you see, I... This is a very busy time for me in my firm. You know, I'm in competition for a promotion with Simon Carr... Don't you know no one can walk the streets at night? Yeah, well, you know, I hear certain... And it's not just the streets. The Quilty sisters were killed in their own home because they didn't lock the door. Throats cut from ear to ear. I thought you said he was a strangler. Does it matter how he kills? So angry, what is he... Hey, what's he gettin' so angry for? Okay. Okay. There's no motive? So, you know about it. Well, you know, I hear, now and then, a drib and drab. He hears what he wants to hear. Get dressed. What do you mean, get dressed? This is police business. The police have had their chance. Now we're taking matters into our own hands. No, that's scary. You're one of us, aren't you, Kleinman? Yes, yes, I'm definitely one of you. What do you want me to do? We have a plan to trap him. Yeah, but, what kind of plan? It's Hacker's. He should tell it. What, well, Hacker, what's... You'll find out your assignment. Get dressed. You're wasting time. - What do you mean? - We'll meet you downstairs in five minutes. Well, okay, but... My theory is that it's someone that we all know. Someone, you know, that we work next to or go to church with. He lurks in the shadows, waiting to pounce. But, you see, I was in a deep sleep, so I was... What is this plan? How can I be of help? Kleinman. Kleinman. In, in, in, in. Kleinman, here. - I brought you some pepper. - Pepper? What... I overheard everything. If you're caught by the maniac, blow pepper in his eyes. Yes, very good. I'll ward him off with a seasoning. This is ridiculous. I'm petrified. I'm not gonna go out. Be a man, Kleinman. What do you mean, be a man? Suddenly, in the middle of the night, I gotta put on a suit and a tie and... What do you need a tie for? You're going to hunt for a homicidal maniac. Do I know who I'll run into out there? What if I see my boss? You know, Mr. Paulsen is funny that way. And there's a big competition between me and Simon Carr for this promotion. What are you killing yourself for that promotion? What does it mean? An extra few dollars? No, I told you. It isn't the money. I wanna amount to something. Why should Carr get the promotion? You know, because he takes Paulsen to dinner all the time? I mean, you're too frightened of Mr. Paulsen. You cringe in front of him like a worm. Well, he makes me nervous. And I don't cringe. Calling your boss "Your Majesty" is cringing. Stop it. I don't like this. I don't wanna have to go out. I was in a nice warm bed. Suddenly I'm part of a plan. When are you gonna come to your senses and marry me? You could tell your boss to stuff it and you'd own half of this whole place. I'm not gonna marry you. I have a fiancée. What are you... Some fiancée. Eve wants you for an ornament, if you get the promotion. Don't... Don't talk about Eve. I don't wanna discuss this all the time. Eve is a lovely creature. Eve treats you like scum. Be careful. I'd hate for them to find you in an alley with your throat slit from ear to ear. Don't worry about that. He mostly strangles. Gee, it's empty. Where, where is everybody? They're supposed to be here. Where the hell did they go? The street's so desolate. I don't like this. I wanna get back into bed. I can't do that, though. If something goes wrong with their plan, they'll say it's my fault. Why me? I'm an artist. Every town we played in, I'd get huge laughs. And here, nothing. I mean, no one comes, and the few that do just sit there stone-faced. I know. I was very little appreciated myself. None of us were. Well, your specialty is quite different to mine. I don't know about that. I, I was thinking you can tell a lot about an audience by how they respond to a good sword-swallower. Mmm, believe me, nothing is more terrifying than attempting to make people laugh, and failing. So, why do we put up with it? When we pull out tomorrow, why don't we just tell Danzig we're quitting? To do what? Well, settle down. Where we don't have to travel all the time, where it's not such a grueling life. Get married, you know. Live like other people. We're not like other people. We're artists. With great talent comes responsibility. But it would be so nice. You could find a job someplace. But then doing what? Collecting other people's refuse? - No. - Sweeping the streets? Of course not. No, you're clever. Somebody'd give you an opportunity. But I have a rare opportunity now, to make people laugh. To make them forget their sad lives. Listen, it's not my fault that this stupid traveling show is completely mismanaged. I'm sure Danzig steals every cent of profit. I wanna have a baby. We're going to have a baby, but not right now. A family? That's death to the artist. I need peace and quiet. I mean, you know, my mind... It's funny... It's just constantly filled with, um, new routines, ideas, gags, brilliant and creative twists. Why don't you tell the truth? You don't want to get married. So, you can play cards and flirt with all the adoring ladies. - That's not true. - Oh, yes, it is. I just want to... I have to make a name for myself first. We will get... You know, I love you. No. You keep promising. But soon it's gonna be too late for me to have a baby. But, too... Don't cry. Listen, I'll talk to Danzig. You don't mean it. I do mean it. Stop. You know I can't stand that. Don't cry. The audience was too quiet tonight. I felt sorry for you. You're the only one they seem to like. Yeah, but I have my little tricks for seducing them. Yes. What are you doing wandering around out here? I was on my way to speak to Danzig. Mmm. Like Irish whiskey? Uh, yes, but my doctor says it's very bad for my stomach. Oh. That's too bad. But, uh... It's probably relaxing. The most voluptuous woman in the circus. It would be my luck she'd be married to the strongman. Don't worry about Peter. He's had a gallon of this already. You know, sometimes when you're up on the high wire, I look at you. You look so... What? Mmm. Edible. How hungry are you now? I'm always famished after a performance. And you? I can never sleep on an empty stomach. Do you have a taste for anything special? I'm not fussy. I eat what you put in front of me. And you're sure your husband won't wake up? I mean, I have seen what he does to iron bars. Nothing wakes Peter up. Certainly not the sound of two people moaning. Oh, you. I thought I saw you come in here. - Hey... - Rat! You rat! Irmy! You said you were going to Danzig. You were supposed to go to Danzig. Shh! My husband. Shh! Damn you! Wait! We were talking about acrobatics. Oh, acrobatics. I was showing him how to do a backbend. You never take your eyes off her. You're always standing under her trapeze, looking up her legs. I see you. Because we're planning this routine. Sure you are. What do you take me for anyway? And I wanted to have a baby with you. I know. We'll continue this later. - Later? - I know, but I don't wanna have a baby. - Oh, you're such a pig. - I told you... You are a pig. But, I told you a thousand times. I don't want a baby with you anyway. I don't want a baby if you were the last man on earth, I don't want a baby with you. Good! You're never gonna have to see me again. Good. Good riddance. I like my freedom. Oh, Doctor. What do you want, Kleinman? I'm sorry to disturb you. Can I come in, just for a minute? Would it be possible? I have a question. Are you in on the plan? Of course I am. Didn't you think I would be? I wanna find out my assignment. Please, don't disturb anything. No, no, no, I wouldn't think of it. I just wanna find out my participation in the plan, you know. Of course, I wouldn't mind having a little drink though. A drink? You know, the fog. It's a little damp. So I, you know... But not if it's an imposition. You know, I've never been here before. This is an interesting... Oh. It's cheerful. I'm performing an unusual amount of autopsies these days. Yes, I'm sure. That's probably what accounts for so many of those human fingers lying around. You don't generally see that. I guess the, the maid doesn't get in that often to straighten up, so... My interest in all this murder business is entirely scientific. I'm sure, I'm sure. I'm determined to use this opportunity to find out something definitive about the nature of evil. Why is the killer the way he is? Sometimes certain impulses that can drive an insane man to murder inspire others to highly creative ends. Once I have him here, on this table, dismembered and scrutinized in minute detail, then I shall know the answer with certainty to questions that now I can only speculate on. Yeah, but it's not possible that under the microscope there's something that you could never see? What are you implying? Uh, a spiritual element? A soul that lives on after we're dead? A God? Ask him if there's anything else. What are you thinking now? I just must remember next time I go out to a restaurant... ...not to order the sweetbreads. Kleinman, you'd better go. The time is growing very short. So, there's nothing you can tell me about my participation in the plan? I'll go. The doctor was no help at all. This is ridiculous. Where is everybody? Unless, this is part of the plan. Maybe they have me under surveillance. If anything bad happens, they'll come running out and grab me. Unless they don't come running out. But they could never think that I'd be any match for a maniac. A deranged person is supposed to have the strength of ten men. I have the strength of one small boy with polio. Quiet, quiet, quiet! It's Bretschneider. He's been strangled. The killer may still be near. Poor Bretschneider. He had no enemies. Don't be afraid. I'm sorry I scared you. Oh, you... You really did scare me. I didn't see you standing there in the shadows. It's such a foggy night. I was just going into town. You should be indoors. It's not safe. I don't care. What was that? I don't know. What are you doing out here tonight? I'm used to the streets. It's how I make my living. Oh. What do you do? Oh, I... I work with the circus. Well, you should have stayed there. Don't you know what's lurking in this fog? I'm never going back. Oh, I see. That's how it is. Except I have no place to sleep. And I'm getting cold. Come on, I'll find you a place at the house. The house? The whorehouse. Me? It's warm. You'll get something to eat. It's a lot safer in there than it is out here. Come on. Stop looking at me like that. You'll have your privacy. Hi, everybody. This is Irmy. She's with the circus. She needs a place to flop tonight. What do you do in the circus, huh? I'm a sword-swallower. A sword-swallower? That's my specialty, too. Yeah. She's pretty good at everything. You hungry? Yes, starving. Good. Just in time for dinner. We got some stew. Come on. - I don't mind spanking them. - Oh, I do. But when I have to speak in the nanny's voice... Wait, wait, the strangest one that I ever had was when I had to make believe that I was twins. - Twins? - I've never worked so hard. Well, he should've hired the Beckman sisters. - Oh! - They're identical triplet whores. They cost a fortune, though. Oh, I hear they're on special call to a sultan in Morocco. Why would any man want identical whores? If you're gonna hire two or three women, wouldn't you want some variety? The worst was the businessman - from Budapest... - Oh! ...and his crazy fantasies. He sent me out at 3:00 in the morning to see if I could buy six pounds of butter. I had to walk him on a leash. They all look so innocent and dignified when they walk in here, don't they? Then you hear the things they want you to do. I think this is shocking Irmy. - Is it? - No, no, no. Not at all. No. I was just... I was just thinking that, for me, I just don't think it would be possible, for me to, you know, just take money from someone and then pretend to feel passion. I just don't think I could do it. I never thought I could either. Till my husband needed an operation. We had no money. You're married? Yeah, I was. After he pulled through, realized how I'd paid the hospital, he left me. Yeah, good riddance. Well, so, that they'd... The customers don't mind that it's just all mechanical? Without any feeling or anything? Mind? Ours is the only business that hasn't been affected by the killings. That's right. There's only one thing men will brave murder for. That little furry animal between our legs. Now, let me tell you something. Men and women want very different things out of sex. Oh, that's for sure. - They've never forgiven each other. - Uh-huh. Well, where... Where would you say love came in? Oh, now, there's only one kind of love that lasts that's unrequited love. It stays with you forever. - Oh. - You take it from me. Oh, Dorry! You're pitiful. - You don't mean that. - I do. No, she's just bitter about marriage. I am not bitter. - Yeah, you are. - Uh-uh. Marriage. Let me tell ya. Let me tell you gals somethin' about marriage. You gotta work at marriage. I mean, like anything else. A good marriage takes a lot of work. When it starts feeling like work, it's over. - No. Come on. - No, it's all luck. - It's all luck. - Why? We're all so dependent on luck. I would rather not admit that, if you don't mind. How... How can it all be luck? - Well, let's say this guy... - Yeah. ...likes to be sat on. I'm serious. And ridden around the room by a naked woman who keeps digging her spurs into his... ...into his side. Yeah, Dorry. Show her your spurs, Dorry. What does he do? He meets maybe 50 women and when he tells them, they faint or they laugh. Or both. And then they die. Maybe a few good sports, you know, do it just to please him, but sooner or later they say "What the hell is this?" "I'm riding around on a man's back." "This is insane." "And my, my spurs are getting, you know, blunt." Bloody. And then one day he meets a woman who gets her own erotic pleasure by putting on spurs and riding men around. It's a marriage made in heaven. Sheer bliss. - You know, Paul is... - But what are their chances? My boyfriend, Paul, he's really sweet. It's just that he's an artist, you know. And, a family's death to an artist. I can understand that. I'm sure you'd all find him very funny. He's really something. Except when I see him out there... In his makeup, just getting knocked around, and falling into a big tub of water, with all the people laughing, I can only think he must have suffered so to act like that. Ah, finally. The rent. We got exams. - There's more in back. - Is that right? Yeah, we're just the welcoming committee. Well, does that mean that I have my choice? Mmm. Your credit's always good, Jack. Who's the new girl? She doesn't work here. God, she's beautiful. She doesn't work here, Jack. I want her. Hi. I'll give you anything you want. - Me? - Mmm-hmm. Oh... Oh, no, I'm just spending the night here. Well, that's all I plan to do. Sorry. I'll give you $20. I'm afraid not. - Fifty. - Sorry. - Fifty. - Not that I'm not flattered. It's very nice of you. Hundred dollars. Jack, she's not a professional. Two hundred dollars. These rich crazies. University students. They wear you out before you get to the back room. I'll give you $500 to spend an hour with me. I'll spend the rest of the year with you for $500. That certainly is an exorbitant sum. You're worth it. How do you know? I might be very disappointing. Six hundred. Cash. What's wrong with you? Can't you hear? She said she wasn't interested. You know, you just might be a little drunk. Listen, you're the most desirable woman I've ever met. I wanna make love to you. I'll give you $700. You can have all of us for 700. We'll even throw in the dog, too. Seven hundred dollars, it's all I won in cards tonight. It's for you. Jack, you're making a fool of yourself. Some people can't be bought, not for any amount of money. Listen, you're really the most sensual woman I've ever seen. It's a quick $700. Go right there in the back room. What do you say? Let me see the 700. Oh, whoo! Can we use the back room? How did you get in? Did you think you could keep me out? So, I'm the next on your list? What list? I can't quite see your face. What difference does that make? Do you think I fear you? Does that give you pleasure? Although I admit, I was taken a little bit by surprise. I see, you're very determined. And yet I feel no fear. Only pity for you. You mean for you. Why are you doing this? Oh... What a foolish question to ask an irrational mind. What do you know about my mind? I know that if I were to examine the inside of your brain, I should find chaos. And yet I am anxious to know where insanity stops and evil begins. So many questions. No! No! No! No! Ahhh! Well, you're $700 richer. You can start a new life. God, I'm thirsty. - You were wonderful. - Mmm. Thank you, but it's not necessary that I be wonderful. I was paying. Still. Listen, tell me the truth. Did you close your eyes and grit your teeth and think of the cash? Well, at first I did, yes. But then I think I just, I think I just relaxed into it. Now I feel so strange, though. Strange in what way? I don't know. Not like me. Not like you. Or was it the real you for the first time? All right. Come on. Come on. Let's go. Come on. Come on. Where's the next one? Come on. Let's go. Come on. Come on, hurry up, hurry up. What is this? What's going on here? Social undesirables. The police said they may be involved in the killings. That's the Mintz family. I know them. They're very lovely people. He does quality circumcisions. I've seen his work. If I were you, I'd mind my own business. Well, this is crazy. They're not... They can't be responsible for the killings. I'm gonna speak to the chief of police. My theory is that if they take them to jail, all these killings might stop. Kleinman. Did you wanna speak to me? Would that be possible? Sit down. Oh, thank you. Thank you. - You're up rather late. - I know. Don't you have to work tomorrow? Yes, I do have to go to work, but I... You're not involved with one of those various street gangs? No. The vigilantes? - Oh, you know? - Uh... Well, you hear stories, you know, but... I'm against them. Yes, no, I am, too. Good. What did you want? I'm very busy. I don't wanna take up any of your time. I just wanted to discuss the Mintz family if I could. Oh, yes. Unfortunate. There may be a connection between all these killings and certain well-poisoning incidents. You understand. But those accusations are so wrong. I mean, they're just not true. Maybe they are, maybe they're not. What do you know about it? Well, I don't know anything. I myself have no personal knowledge of anything. But the Mintzes are lovely people. Don't look so apprehensive, Kleinman. It'll probably never go any deeper than the more orthodox elements. You see, nobody's guilty of anything. Kleinman, there's pressure on me to get to the bottom of these killings. You're not worried, are you? No one lumps you in with the Mintzes. You're fine. So don't get your nose dirty. You know, besides, I have my own theories about what's going on. The doctor's been murdered. We think there may be someone trying to copy the murderer. We found a glass with fingerprints on it. - What kind of glass? - It's a sherry glass. - How many prints? - We got a lot of prints. Prints on the glass? We got fingerprints all over the glass. Okay, I'm coming. You don't have to push me. Will you just let go of me? How many times do I have to tell you? Hey, Bok, you need handcuffs? I don't work at the brothel. What's this? Turning tricks at Felice's place. No license. I work at the circus. - Stand there. She's loaded with cash. - The circus. Where's a dame like you get big money? - Well, I... - Yeah, we know. What did you do? The whole regiment? - Very funny, very funny. - Look at this one. I work at the circus. You'd think they'd cool off with all this going on here. I haven't seen you around here before, so I'm gonna go easy on you. Fifty dollar fine. - I don't work at the brothel. - Uh-huh. Put some handcuffs on her. Okay, here. Fifty dollars, fifty dollars, okay. - But I don't work at the brothel. - Let me give you a piece of advice. Can I go home now, please? You don't solicit around here unless you got a license. I know. We like things hygienic and well-regulated. I'll give you a receipt. What's your name? - I don't need a license. - What's your name? - Irmy. - How do you spell it? I-R-M-Y. I don't need a license. - Just pipe down. - I work at the circus. You're not getting a license. You're getting a receipt. Now just be quiet. You work here, you need a license. Boy, this is ridiculous. What are you staring at? Me? I'm not a whore. What did I say? You know... Do I care what your hobbies are? I... I'm just... You know... Are you all right? Yeah. It's not safe to be out on the street tonight, you know. Then what are you doing out? Well, I'm part of a citizens' committee to patrol the streets, so it's okay for me. Are you from around here? No, I'm with the circus. The circus? Really? I saw the circus. Which one are you? I'm the sword-swallower. The sword-swallower, I didn't recognize you. You look completely different. Well, I know. I wear a beautiful costume and my hair is different. I went to see Almstead the magician because he's a favorite of mine. I'm an amateur magician myself. You know, just something I do in my spare time. And I idolize him. He's an artist, a great artist. Yeah, he's an artist when he's sober. Well, you know... Listen, is there a hotel or something around here? I had a fight with my boyfriend. It's late. So, when you have the sword down your throat, what happens if you get hiccups? Jesus. You know, I don't know my way around this part of town. I don't think there's gonna be a hotel open at this hour, you know. I think I should wake up my fiancée and you could sleep on the sofa. Oh, no, I don't want to wake anybody up. She would be glad to. You know, it's... It's so foggy. He strikes in the fog, you know. You didn't hear anything, did you? - Footsteps. - You're so tense. Well, I'm usually in bed, you know, this time of night. What would you do if you came face to face with the killer? I'd throw pepper in his eyes. Really? My landlady put some pepper in my pocket. I think I could handle myself. Kleinman! What are you doing here? Oh, my God! You scared me. Who is she? She's just a friend. Do you happen to know my assignment? Who gave you permission to socialize? I'm not socializing. You know, she's... Maybe you recognize her. She's with the circus. She's the sword-swallower. She's unescorted. I was just walking next to her. We're getting closer to the zero hour. Yeah? So what do I do? - Don't you know? - No. That's the point. You know, you got me up, in the middle of the night and no one's told me what I'm supposed to be doing. Kleinman, I swear, if anyone is killed or hurt as a result of your incompetence. No, I don't know enough to be incompetent. You know, they don't tell me what I'm supposed to... All right, just don't make a noise, and listen to me. There is someone lurking up the alley. Well... Shall I just start weeping or would you like me to break into a run? It's a chance to trap him. Whoever it is. No. I don't wanna trap anybody. We'll get reinforcements. There's three of us only. What they say about you isn't true, is it? You're not really a coward or a worm or a yellow-belly? No, but keep going. You're in the right column. All right, I'll circle around the block. You head straight up the alley. No, I don't wanna do this. No, this is, this is trouble. - I can go with you. - No! She's gonna go with me. What good are you? You're a small woman. - She's gonna, you know... - I'm okay. You go first. It'll throw his timing off if he sees a body. Go on, Kleinman. It'll take me a moment or two to get round the other side. Keep ahead of me. Those are my knees knocking. Stay calm. The trick is not to show fear. There he is! Look! Grab him! Grab him! - Kleinman! - Mr. Paulsen! You know him? This is my boss. He's the head of my firm. - What are you doing here? - I'm part of the plan, Your Grace. - Why did you attack me? - I thought... "Thought"? Since when do you think, Kleinman? Yes, you're right, Your Majesty. I shouldn't have... I had a suspicion you were incompetent, hiding behind the efforts of your co-workers. Don't let him talk to you like that. - What? - He was peeping in that window watching that woman getting undressed. - How dare you. - He was. No, no, no. Don't listen to her. She's swallowed too many sharp objects. Don't be a doormat for this Peeping Tom. This is my boss. He's my boss. To think that I was undecided about your abilities versus Simon Carr. Yes, what can I say, sir? You looked dangerous. I didn't know you were merely peeping. Why didn't you attend to your function in the plan? I don't know my function. You don't know? You unreliable simpleton. - Don't call him a simpleton. - No, well put. - It was well put. - You're a disgusting old man. No, don't say that. Go away. Go away, Miss. Whoever you are, go away. Go away, go away. Leave us alone. Paulsen? You gave us quite a scare. I sent Kleinman round here to check you out. He was just, you know, looking in the window. There was a woman... Mark my words, he'll be a detriment. No, sir. Don't say that, sir. Let me block your hat. No, give me that. Sir, you... I'm sorry. He's always been a liability with my firm. I'm only just now beginning to realize it. Mr. Paulsen, I didn't mean it. You... Sir! Irmy! Irmy! We're closing. Just one beer? Please? Did anyone see a blonde woman wandering around alone? Short hair. Oh, mercy. We never know when we have a good thing. We always have to ruin it. I know exactly how you feel. The earthly paradise known as woman. All we'll ever know of heaven. All we need know of hell. I made love to a woman tonight that was sheer perfection. And it's true it was in a brothel, but somehow this one didn't have that used, jaded quality. I never do it with whores. You start out with a burning desire and end up the next day with a burning sensation, if you know what I mean. Yes, but this one was so irresistible. Sweet and innocent. But under the sheets, a tigress. A violent, screaming, passionate jungle cat. You mean a good actress. She swore not. Well, you're very young, my friend. Very naive. She dug her nails into my back. I'm sure. And then she yelled "Don't stop! Don't stop!" Yes. And stuck her tongue inside my mouth and wiggled it around. I'm sure it was well worth the $20. Twenty? I paid her 700. Yeah. Yeah, sure. Tell me another one. I'm afraid you've never made love with a sword-swallower. I beg your pardon? She claims she never took money before. And if she was acting, she should win a prize. It's true that I put on a heroic performance, if I do say so myself. She brought out the stallion in me. And when she said she loved it, I believe she was sincere. I think she's got a lover who doesn't service her too well, you know? Some poor clown. But I showed her what a good one felt like. What's wrong? You look incredulous. I swear, the dirtier I got, the more she screamed. I gave her the best time she's had in years, and I believe she loved it. Not that I have any further urge for her, you know. The difference between love and lust, I guess. When my friend wakes up, tell him I went back to Felice's. This is crazy. Can't I talk you out of it? No, I don't want it. I want the church to have it, all of it. Yeah, but you're talking about $700. - That's a lot. - Six hundred and fifty. I had to pay a fine. But so, you know, you... But it's your money. Why give it away? Because I'm ashamed of the way I got it. Listen, I'm sure you didn't steal it. No. I slept with somebody for it. Yes? Just one person. Does that make me a whore? Well, only by the dictionary definition. Anyway, I'm giving it to the church. Yeah, but that seems so silly. You know... It's work, you know. I'm sure you didn't do it for fun. No. But you know something? It turned out to be fun. Here. Would you take it in there for me and give it to them? - Me? - Yeah. For the poor. I just can't bring myself to go in there tonight. Please? Come on. - Excuse me, I'm... - Yes? I just need a minute of your time. I think you can see that we're busy. I just... Just for one... Put Kramer's name on the list. Have you seen his sketches and his photo studies? Just for a minute, if I might have your attention... Just for one moment. Didn't you hear him say we're busy? Are you Kleinman? Yes. Yes, I am. Yes. Don't forget. Why is he putting my name on the list? You've been warned twice now. What is this list? Might I just ask? I have a donation to make. The poor box is in the front. No, this doesn't fit in the poor box. Kleinman, you want me to take you in? No, no, no. I have $650. Six hundred and fifty dollars? Don't worry, it's not stolen. He thinks it's stolen. Where did you get it? I assure you. My friend said I should donate it. Where did your friend get it? I don't think that we don't have to pry excessively. We humbly accept this token from the faithful. And I think that we know how to show gratitude when someone performs an act of charity. Manna for the poor. Did you do it? - Yeah, I took care of it. - Oh. I feel so much better now. - Good. - Are you a religious person? Me? No, I'm not. You're the second person tonight to ask me that question. The doctor, may he rest in peace, wanted to know. - Do you pray ever? - No. 'Cause my people pray in a different language, you know, I never understood what they were saying. For all I know, you know, they were requesting their own troubles. Help me. Please help me. Help. - Are you all right? - Who is that? I'm hungry. I need to buy food and milk. My husband is dead. I'm alone. We're friends. You know, you're among friends. Go back and get some of the money back. What are you talking about? I want her to have half of it. I can't get the money back. I just gave them the money. So what? Just ask for half back. You just gave it to them. They give it to the poor, don't they? Well, theoretically they do, but a lot of it is used to buy costumes and velvet pillows and stuff. Please. Oh... My friend asked me if I could possibly come and just have half the money back that I gave you. Just $300. It would... Thank you. Kleinman. Is that with an "ei" or an "ie"? Put a circle around it. Eve. Eve, open up. It's Kleinman. Eve. Eve, it's an emergency. It's me. It's Max. This is a bad idea. No, she's a wonderful girl. Very intelligent. Eve! Eve! What are doing here at this hour? Who is this? Can we come in? What's going on? She's a friend of mine. She has no place to sleep tonight. I told her she could sleep on your sofa. You did? We're sorry. It's much too much of an imposition. You dare to wake me out of a deep sleep so that some complete stranger can sleep on my sofa? She's not a complete stranger. She's a friend. You know, Eve, I personally vouch for her. I apologize, Miss. Kleinman, have you been drinking? Have I been... When do I ever drink? Since when is she your friend? Since tonight. I met her at the police headquarters. They brought her in when they raided the brothel. It's not what it sounds like. You know, everybody makes one mistake now and then. Kleinman, what are you doing out at this hour? I'm part of a vigilante committee to help catch the maniac. By doing what? I don't exactly know. Go home, Kleinman. And take your friend with you. You've got some nerve. We'll discuss this in the morning. Boy, Eve is a cold fish. There. I said it. Is it hard for you to admit certain things to yourself? Usually it is, yes. But for some reason tonight is different. You know, it's a strange feeling to be up at this hour. The city is so odd when everybody's asleep. You know, it's like a - different place completely. - Mmm-hmm. There's no civilization. The stores are closed. You know, it's so free. It's an odd feeling for me. I feel I could run down the street naked and nobody would... You know, it has a really free feeling. I've never seen it from up here. I've never really taken the time to look. It's so pretty, you know, some of the stars are beginning to come up. The fog is just breaking a tiny bit. You see that very bright star up in that direction? Mmm-hmm. For all we know, that star could have disappeared a million years ago, and it's taken the light from it a million years to reach us. Oh, so what are you saying? That star is not there? That it might not be there. Even though I can see it with my own eyes? That's right. That's a very, uh, disquieting thought, you know. Because when I see something with my own eyes, I like to know that it's actually there. 'Cause otherwise, you know, a person could sit down in a chair and break his neck. You know, you have to be able to rely on things. That's very, very important. You know who has these thoughts all the time? Schultz the tailor. He thinks that nothing is real at all and that everything exists only in the dream of a dog. But this is real, isn't it? And beautiful. Just think about it for a minute. Here we are, we're two strangers, and we're out in the night, and it's just so peaceful and quiet. And suddenly there's, there's a little clearing in the fog and we can see right out there to the stars. Doesn't this moment just seem perfect? Yes, but, you know, it passes so quickly. Look. Even now the fog is starting to go back in. And you know, everything... Everything's always moving all the time, you know. Everything's constantly in motion, so it's no wonder that I'm nauseous. My father used to say "We're all happy, if we only knew it." Kleinman! We've been looking all over for you. I've been wandering around all night in the fog. You know, I'm still waiting for Hacker to tell me what to do. Hacker's dead. The killer got Hacker? Hacker wasn't murdered by the maniac. Well, who then? Someone from the other faction. What other faction? Since when did we have other factions? A lot of people have their own ideas about how to achieve results. So, naturally, there's tension. Miller formed his own group. But so quickly it becomes violent? Hacker asked for it. He was stubborn and hot-headed, despite the fact that his plan wasn't working. You sound like you didn't agree with him either. I'm with Vogel's group. Who's Vogel? What's... Since when is there a third group? I told you. There's disagreement on how to handle things. Yeah, but that's the last thing in the world we need is disagreement. You know, we should be pulling... Don't lecture me, Kleinman! Are you with us or against us? I don't know. I don't have enough facts so I can choose. Now listen, Kleinman. Lives are at stake. You have to make a choice. You can't threaten him. Kleinman, don't take this from him. She's starting already. Don't get me into... Who's this? There you are, Kleinman. Where the hell have you been? Where have you been? For God's sakes, you wake me in the middle of the night. Now I hear Hacker's dead. You wandered off just when we needed you. Well, so, you didn't tell me anything. Kleinman's joined our faction. From now on he's with us. Is that true, Kleinman? No, no. Look, the thing to do, we have to cooperate. Are you with them or us? I don't know. How can I know? I don't know what the alternatives are. You know, is one apples, is one pears? Are they both tangerines? Let's kill him now before he gives everything away. What are you talking... I don't know anything. I can't give anything away. Meanwhile, we're here arguing and there's an enemy out there killing us. You know, soon we're gonna do his killing for him. The murderer. He believes he's located the guilty party. It's Spiro, the great clairvoyant. I've heard of him. He's solved a lot of important cases. They say all he needs is something to sniff or feel. That's right. He's solved some kidnappings. Mr. Spiro is on the verge of revealing the killer. Mr. Spiro wishes to sniff you. Me? Yes. Well, how come? It's enough he wishes it. No! No, don't let him do it. Hey, wasn't that woman booked on prostitution charges earlier tonight? Come on, Kleinman, come on. I don't wanna, I don't wanna get sniffed. - No, I don't want... - Come on! I don't wanna be sniffed! No... Stand still. Go ahead, sniff away. This is crazy. Why should he sniff me? This is... What is this man sniffing? It's probably cheese, you know, 'cause tonight was the night I changed the traps in the bedroom. Frightened, Kleinman? No, I'm not frightened. This is unfair. Kleinman, stand up for your rights. I know what he's sniffing. It's salad dressing. It's salad dressing. I had... I spilled salad dressing on myself this evening. My landlady cooks for me, so she made me a nice salad with a little whitefish. She makes beautiful whitefish. I can't have meat... Shut up! This man has something in his pocket. Mr. Spiro has done it again. What are you talking about? Look in his pocket. I have nothing. There's nothing. Check his inside pocket. This was stolen from police headquarters earlier tonight. This is stolen property. I carry a glass with me. I get thirsty, so... I like to have, you know, occasionally... Here! We've trapped him! Why'd you do it, Kleinman? You killed the doctor. Do what? You gonna believe this guy from smelling me? Mr. Spiro's uncanny power has never failed him yet. Why would I kill the doctor? Doesn't make sense. The man took out my gall bladder, you know. With my consent. Don't expect him to make sense. That's how it is with a psychopath. They can be logical on every point except one, their weakness, their point of insanity. That's right. And Kleinman's always so damn logical. This is a joke, isn't it? Look, look, we're all reasonable, reasonable, you know, normal, rational people, right? Tell me where you got this. Tell us how you... Once again I thank the Lord for the special gift he has seen fit to bestow on me. I say we make an example of him. Who has a rope? No, you can't do this. Kleinman, defend yourself. They're picking on me. I didn't do anything. - How do you plead, Kleinman? - Not guilty. I plead not guilty. I never did anything in my life to deserve any trouble. If anything, I deserve a bonus. Come on! Let's get him. Ahhh! Where'd he get that pepper? Let me in. It's me, Max. - Who is it? - Max. Max. Max. Let me in. Max? Yes! I have to come in. They're after me. Max. Stop staring at me. I'm not a ghost. Not yet, although they're trying to kill me. - Who? - There's a mob. And you dare to come here? What could I do? I'm running for my life, you know, and I saw your place and, you know, I... Whatever they think about you, I'm sure you're guilty of it. Alma, is it possible that I could murder somebody? Alma, I'm asking you a question. It's me, Max. I never wanted to lay eyes on you again. I know. I did a bad thing. You know, but time heals. It's been years. The more I thought about it, the more I wanted you dead. Dismembered, cut in little pieces and thrown to the dogs. Jesus. You've really given this thing some very specific thought. You're the worst scum, and I won't rest until you fry in hell. Can I stay here tonight? Is it... How could you do it? How could you leave me standing there at the altar in front of family and friends, humiliated and weeping? I've explained that to you. There's two sides to every story. What two sides? Do you deny we were to be married and you made an idiot of me in front of everyone? I was nervous. I was a little drunk. I was unsure. Unsure? It was your idea to get married. And it was your idea to get me pregnant. It was a hysterical pregnancy. You weren't actually pregnant. So what? Will you just keep quiet? I'm trying to hide. We looked everywhere. My father, my mother, my brothers. "Where could he be?" "He was here before the ceremony. True, he was drinking." Listen, I know what you're gonna say. While everybody's walking around, puzzled and muttering, sensing my discomfort, he's discovered in a broom closet, making love with my sister. Jesus. I thought I explained that to you. What kind of explanation could you possibly have? You were naked in the closet with my sister. Look at her. She still holds that against me. It's not that I didn't like you. I like you, I like you a lot. I just didn't love you. And I thought you were pregnant. I was trying to do the honorable thing. The honorable thing? To desert me at the altar and make love with my younger sister in a broom closet is the honorable thing? Look, we just had your best interests at heart. I want you dead, and her. No. Don't say a thing. She was a wonderful girl. She's fabulous. She loved you. She worshipped you like a goddess. She was singing your praises. I promise you. Till the moment I slipped her pants off... Get out of here! Be careful with that. Be angry with me. All right, all right, fault me. But not Trudy. Not Trudy, I beg of you. Not your sister. I convinced her to do it. She didn't wanna do it. I promised to get her steaks. Kleinman's here! - Here he is! - Shh! Kleinman's here! Get out and die. Get out. Die! You rot in hell, you filthy vermin. It's good to see you're not bitter after all these years. You whore! I'll kill you. You're the one who should be ashamed. How could you? With a student for a few silver coins? It wasn't a few silver coins. He gave me $700. Yes, but you didn't know what you were doing. - If you must know, I enjoyed myself. - I'll kill you. - No, no, no! - I hate you! I was drunk. I was miserable. I hate you! I hate you! I'll kill you! I wish we'd never met. Come home. I never want to see you again. - He was young and handsome. - Get away! Yes, he was! And you enjoyed yourself? Was he a better lover than me? He treated me romantically. But he felt nothing. Just lust, pure lust. I don't care to talk about it. Yeah, I'm sure you don't. Where's the money? - I gave it to charity. - You're joking! You don't think I'm worth $700? There isn't a whore in the world worth $700, especially not an amateur whore like you. Bastard! You... Wait. What's that? Oh... I'm scared. Don't panic. Hold me. I'll protect you. It is rather scary. - Oh, my God! It's gruesome. - What? - Oh, God... - Be quiet. Stay there. Oh... I hear footsteps. - Listen. - No, they're getting fainter. Quick, we have to get out of here. Wait. Do you hear something? The same woman. The same woman I... I saw her earlier. We gave her some money. She... She had a baby with her. Oh... Oh! Oh! It's too horrible to think about. Is she all right? Oh, the poor little thing. We'll have to keep the baby. What? What are you talking about? - Well, she has no one. - What about her father? - No... There is none. - How do you know? I talked to the woman earlier. There's no... There's no father. There's no family. She has no one. She was all alone. But we can't keep a baby. What do you want to do, just leave her in the gutter? No, but... But what? She needs parents. - Yes, but... - Stop yes butting and no butting. I wanted a baby, now God has dropped one in my lap. We have no money. But... We do. Come here. Look. - You just hold her for a second. - I can't. Just hold her for a second. Be careful. Here, maybe... Don't put her on the ground. Oh... Here. Three hundred dollars. It's not legal. We have to give her over to an orphanage. How are they going to treat her in an orphanage? Oh. She needs love and care. She needs a mother and a father. It's out of the question. Well, I'm going to keep her. No, you are... You're going to put her back where I found her and we'll inform the police. - Help! - Quiet! The killer could be lurking. You don't have to, but I'm going to raise this baby. She's so tiny. She's pretty. I didn't say she wasn't pretty. This is madness. Madness. She is beautiful. Oh, God. Oh, God. - I saw him go this way. - All right, lead on the right. Kleinman. Did anybody look down there? He's gotta be over here. Or maybe down here. Down here. Try down here. He must be down here. Down the stairs. No, I don't want to interrupt anything. - I just want to rest for a minute. - You're not interrupting anything. Oh, come in, come in. Come in. You're welcome. It's late. There's no one here but us. I never come... This is not... What's your name, sweetheart? - Kleinman. - Well, sit down, Mr. Kleinman. Let me get you something to drink. It's late. Jack's one of our regulars. I find this atmosphere a lot more stimulating than university. - As long as we do the stimulating. - That's right. I was just pointing out to these lovely ladies the metaphors of perversion. Oh, my goodness, such big words. Yeah, the chief magistrate likes me to tie him up, hand and foot. He pays me for that. Exactly my point. You take away his freedom and he becomes blissful, delighted, sexually aroused. - He's frightened of his freedom. - Oh... He's frightened, is he? What's he frightened of? Who knows. Whatever his impulses are. - Aw... - Power, lust, murder. There are laws against murder. Haven't you heard about that? Maybe certain people obey only their own laws. Is that what they teach you at the University, to be superior? No, no, no, no. We learn facts. Nothing but facts. Logic and Mathematics and how to become depressed. Your problem is you don't believe in anything. Oh, spoken by a true whore who believes only in cash. Better... Better false gods then no god at all. Hmm? Here's a thoughtful looking man. What are your views on divine matters? Excuse me, you... Me? I'm asking you if you believe in God. It's... It's incredible, that's the third time tonight somebody asked me that exact same question. You know, I would love to. Believe me, I know I would be much happier. Yeah, but you can't. I can't, no. It's just, you know... You doubt his existence and you can't make the leap of faith necessary. Listen, I can't make the leap of faith necessary to believe in my own existence. Here's your drink, Kleinman. That's fine. That's tricky. You keep making jokes until the moment comes and you've really got to face death. Why are we on such a morbid subject? I just, you know... That's the future, you know. Oh, is it the future? No, no, no. The trick is to have as much wine, as many men, as many laughs as you can until they carry you out in a pine box. And then don't go easily. When I go, I want to die in my sleep without ever knowing. That's some world when the nicest gift that you can wish for someone you really care for is that they die in their sleep. If I thought that there was nothing except this, I'd kill myself. I've thought of it. Believe me, there have been many times when my brain has said, "Why not?" I mean, there's no point to anything. But somehow my blood always said, "Live, live." And I always listen to my blood. How about you, Kleinman? You know, I know exactly what I think about all this, but I can never find the words to put it in, you know, maybe if I get little drunk I could dance it for you. And, express myself. Come on, honey, I know what's on your mind. Come on. Let's go to the bedroom. I've never paid for sex in my life. Oh, you just think you haven't. Enjoy yourself, Kleinman. May all your ups and downs be in bed. You're in a peculiar mood. That little circus performer. You still haven't gotten her out of your mind. Isn't that odd? A moment's chance encounter, a business transaction with a total stranger. I mean, we barely spoke. And yet tonight I feel like I've lost something. I'm so sorry. This never happened to me before. I never have any problem. It's so humiliating. I just... What's the matter, honey? Don't you like me? - No, it isn't that. - Huh? Don't you? I'm sure it's that conversation we were having downstairs. Maybe we should try a new position, huh? No, hey, believe me, it isn't the position. You know, I've used this position before, many times, and it has always worked very effectively for me. You know, sometimes within a matter of seconds... Kleinman, some men are looking for you. We can't have any trouble here. - Is there another way out? - The roof. Hurry. What was that? Behind here. Down there. Simon Carr. What are you doing here? I'm part of Nagel's plan. Nagel has a plan, too? Everybody has a plan. I'm the only one in town that doesn't know what he's doing. By the way, Kleinman, I ran into Mr. Paulsen before, uh, he's, uh, giving me the promotion. He said that? Actually, he said that sees you as a kind of cringing, slimy vermin, more suited to extermination than life on this planet. I don't think he means it personally. Carr, did you happen to see a young woman with a big hat and a valise wandering around? Yes, I did, with a man and a child. A man and a child? Yes, they were out by the bridge, toward the circus. Cringing, slimy vermin... - Come on. Hurry up with that milk. - I'm coming. She's gonna fall asleep. - Don't overfeed her. - I'm not going to overfeed her. Okay, now this is warm. She's so beautiful. - Look at her eyes. - I know. Be careful. Her fingers are very tiny. I'm careful. I'm very careful. - Now she's asleep. She won't drink this. - Yes. Look, she smiled at me. - Oh, look. - Did you see that? She smiled. - She's the future. - Yeah. You're the future. I want her to go to school. I don't want her to be a traveling gypsy like us. I just want to hold her for a minute. Can I hold her for a second? - No, you better... No. - I won't wake her up. No, because you squeeze too hard. - No. No. - I don't squeeze hard. - No. No. - Come on, please. - Just let's feed her. - No I want to hold her. - Listen, no. - Please. - We'll have another baby instead. - Another baby? Yeah. I don't want her to grow up alone. - It's not good to grow up alone. - Oh... She'll be too lonely. Wonderful. Irmy, look out! Look out, it's the killer. - It's the killer. - Kleinman? Yes, I'm here! Run! Run! Run! - What about you? - Don't worry! I'll take care of... Don't come near her. Don't come near her. Run! Run! What about you? Don't worry about me. I can take care of myself. Don't come near me. Good evening. I am Almstead, the magician. Almstead! My God. I do some tricks myself. I'm an amateur magician. So you're my idol. I came to the... Just to see you. I was just celebrating our closing performance. And, also, of course, packing up my illusions and my paraphernalia. The killer is loose. You have to stop. - The killer is loose. - Oh... - The evil one. - Yes. Yes, roaming. There he is. Think of something. Think quick! Come! Come! Over here! Quickly! Come! - What? - My mirror illusion. Come. You must help. Come. Yes, come. Alley-whoop! Come, come, young man. Jump into the mirror. Come. The evil one comes. Just jump. Jump. Jump. We got him. We got him. We have captured the beast. Yes, we got him. - Yes. - We got him. Fantastic. He was right... He was right... Yes, he was here. Now he's there. - Come on everybody. - Yes, come, come. We got him. - Where is he? - Where is he? Almstead got him. He is over there. Bound in the chains. - Where is he? - Over there. Bound hand and foot in... Where did he go? Where is he? What are you talking about? - He was right here. He was... - I'm amazed. Kleinman saw him. He was here. Yes I did. He was right over here. No man could have escaped from... Look, look. You see here, these are real locks. - Yes we had him. - Almstead, you drink too much. - No, he was... - I tell you he was here. We had the killer. Search the building. Looks like he's a better magician than you. I'm so tired. I can't even think straight. - I can imagine. - I want to go to sleep. - We definitely had him. Believe me. - Yes. - Ask him. - Even I could not have escaped. All I know is you certainly saved my life. You were very brave. Well, I can be brave, you know? You were. It's just that I can't think about it first, you know. If I ever think about what's going to happen to me, then I lose control of my muscles. Well, I guess this is goodbye, you know. We're going to be pulling out in a few hours. - It's been a strange night hasn't it? - Oh... I feel like my whole life has changed. Me too. Very, very unusual. So are you going to be okay? I should be all right you know, apart from the fact that I'm wanted by a lynch mob, and the police are after me and there's a homicidal maniac loose, and I'm unemployed, you know, everything else is fine. What are you going to do? Mr. Kleinman. You know that I'm looking for an assistant? You are? Yes, you said that you knew all of my tricks, huh? Yes, I'm an amateur magician. I'm an amateur. As a matter of fact, I can do a little thing here that you might appreciate. This is... You know... I'm not as good as I once... Wait, wait, wait. Because I'm nervous. Because it's almost... Oh, wait. Well, that is a beginning. Hey, yes. Of course it is. Now, at any rate, you know, you assisted Almstead at a critical time. I am still bewildered by his miraculous escape. My theory is we did something to deserve all this. Oh, that's crazy. Theories, that's all I hear all night. Theories and questions. What's your theory? My theory is that nothing good is going to happen until we catch him. So, Mr. Kleinman, do you wish to assist the great Almstead? Watch this. I would love to, believe me, but I, you know, can't just run away and join the circus. Oh, just what's wrong with the circus? You travel, you drink. There's beautiful women. I can't. You know what, I'm going to join the circus. That's crazy. You know, I have to go back to town and, you know, join real life. Like what? What? What do you mean, like what? You know, what kind of question is that? I could marry my landlady and run a boarding house. Oh, yes, yes, yes. The gray hat. Sooner or later we all must put on the gray hat of compromise. No, I'm, you know... Believe me, I'm flattered by your offer but I, you know... At heart I'm a clerk you know, I'm an ink-stained wretch is what it is in the end. So you do not wish to apprentice with the immortal Almstead, eh? Hmm. Well, you know, they come from all over to see Almstead even the crowned heads. I once produced a rabbit from between the bosoms of the Queen of Denmark. A small rabbit. Small bosoms. How could I work for the circus? You know, it's crazy. Although I must say, to be Almstead's assistant would be... It's crazy, it's just a dream. I don't know if we're going to be passing through this way again. - Good luck. - You take care of yourself. - You, too. - Thank you. Huh. Imagine turning down an opportunity to work with a legend in the show business. Meanwhile, your tricks didn't stop the killer. No, no, but we checked his reins for a moment, perhaps we even frightened him. Look. Look what he has done to my mirror. Well, I had better pack up my paraphernalia. Almstead. I've decided to accept your offer. Congratulations. Of course, the pay is very low. That's okay. I don't need much money. You just give me... Very, very low pay. I understand that, but it's no problem. Perhaps even lower than you might think. I don't care. This is going to be the first time in my life that I can actually do something that I really love. Love? Just make sure that love does not interfere with your duties. No. Don't worry, my duties come first. What better way to spend the rest of my life than to help you with all those wonderful illusions of yours. It's true. Everybody loves his illusions. Loves them. They need them like they need the air.
