The Little Saint Sancta Maria mater Dei... Ora pro nobis peccataribus nunc et in hora mortis nostrae Amen Ave Maria... Ave Maria Thank you Mr Celestin. Thank you my children. You may take a walk in the park before you go to bed. Thank you, dear Mother! It's such a joy to hear those innocent children sing! You've been really successful with everything, Mr Celestin. Thank you dear Mother. Mr Celestin... I say now...! Why aren't you out playing with the other children? I would like to ask a favour, Brother. What would that be, Sister? Could I borrow the music to "Gloria in excelsis missa personas". I've no time now, I'm leaving. To go to bed. I've no time. I have time. I can imagine. You dear sisters have so much of it. I can get it myself. I know where it is. So are you the one who's been messing around with my music? Yes... I'm the one. Well I'll overlook it, this time. Thank you Brother. - That's alright Sister. - Thank you, Brother. Cheeky brat! Auguste... Do you have my dress-suit? It's hanging up there. The carriage is waiting outside in the street, in the usual place. What is it you do every evening? You don't ask questions in a priory. Then even the very best of people avoid telling a lie. To lie is one of the worst sins. I can't get this stain out. Cointreau! What do I tell the prioress if she asks what you're doing? Say you don't know... then you don't need to lie. "Angels bless those with sinless tongues." Water your flowers, but do not immerse yourself in worldly things. "Worldly things?" One can't help asking... - Is she pretty... - Who? - that "worldly thing"? Is she! fantastic... wonderful! She will bring me honour, and renown. No, you can't come in! I'm getting changed... I mean undressed! - Who? - Yes... Who is it It's only me. Are you going to bed so early? Oh, Mother Prioress! I've been feeling so strange... chilled feet and a cold back... or other way round or vice versa. Tell me, do you have a fever? A terribly high fever... 40 degrees... in the shade. 40?! 37 and 3 makes 40. That's not so bad. I just wanted you to hang up the psalm numbers for the morning devotions. Yes... in a minute... Thank you, but I can do it myself. Just tell me which one... Psalm 31, first verse, and 54, second verse... And a hosanna to finish. Yes... a hosanna. I'll bring you a warm pot of camomile tea. No, no, please don't go to that trouble! And I can't drink camomile tea... It's too strong for me.. Camomile is good for little stomachs. No, his stomach can't cope with camomile tea! Wouldn't it be better with red wine? That's a nice idea... It always makes ME feel really good! It'll suffice if you come to the singing lesson at 8am. Yes, by then I'm sure I'll be back... Back to good health, and feeling better, I mean. Thank you Mother Prioress, and good night. Good night, and sleep well! I'll come back in a little while. Welcome, Hosanna... Mother Prioress. This is damnable! Don't swear in her hearing! Just say "hmm-hmm" instead. So what the hmm-hmm are we going to do now? Let me think. But she's coming back. You'll have to fix it for me. This evening and tomorrow will see the end of it. What do I get for all my trouble? I'll pray to the Madonna to forgive you. Well, if we add to that... a bottle of red wine, that'll do. There you are, A small bottle... Have a hot toddy instead. Then you'll feel REALLY good. How am I going to get out? I'm running late! Patience, Brother... Don't be in such a rush. Help me get out! No, leave me out of it! I'm off! Of all the officers in my regiment... I've become attached to you. Why ever for, I really don't know. Where was I? Oh, that's right... My best friends, Baron and Baroness Flavigny... ...have a daughter they want to marry off. Wonderful, Major! Is she beautiful? Don't interrupt me! I haven't finished! Don't yell at your subordinates, dear. I'm not yelling! I'm in the process of arranging a good match for him... A really good match! The major is recommending me as a marriage candidate. Yes, to a pretty young girl. The girl goes to the Priory of the Little Swallows. My sister is the prioress. Does she serve there? Well of course my sister serves there! Come on, calm down! Think of Napoleon on St Helena for so long. He survived for several years. - Who's there? - It's the prioress. What shall I do? You must help me! Just a moment... I'm fit to be seen at the moment. That's for sure. He can't be visited yet... Just one moment more..! It came on very suddenly. Yes it was sudden... He went straight to bed. It may be something rampant. Maybe it's German measles? Germans? No, the front gate has been shut tight. He needs looking after. This hot water bottle will be good for his feet.. Hot water bottles don't help if you're wearing shoes like these. I mean, you should have warmer shoes on! Here you are! Thanks, but I can't drink anything. I sleep so badly if I drink anything. This really good for a cold. Drink this while it's still hot. Goodness! Are you wearing a starched collar? I feel so good with something warm around my throat... something stiff. Of course. Now sleep well... I'll see you in the morning. Auguste can check on you now and then. I shan't budge from his bedside all night. Thank you so much. If it doesn't get any better, let my family know. Good evening... Where are you up to? We've rehearsed the first act. Where's Corinne? Corinne? In her dressing room. Isn't the composer coming this evening? Oh yes... Floridor is so infatuated with me! What does the major say about that? He'll never know. I see him by day, and Floridor by night. And the major is often out on training manoeuvres at night. How about that! Love... sweet love! That will be him! Darling, accept my tribute! How do you coping with all the rehearsals and performances? Everything for art and your success! Your music, and most of all, you, have inspired me so much! I'm going to make you famous. Cheers! I wonder what the prioress would say. What? Prioress? Do you visit priories? No, I have a distant sister who is a prioress. Don't worry about it. She's renounced everything all of this world. That's true! For example... men! She's renounced them? She's never mentioned it. Cheers! No... I loaned you the money and you promised to find a new star. Corinne is not pulling them in any more! What are you talking about?! She can pull in a regiment of dragoons! The premiere is going to be a sell-out! You can't lose with her. I'll guarantee it. - Well and good! - Thank you, Major. Corinne is the greatest artiste that I've met.... ...in the last 2 years. I think I know why. You two are the same vintage. What the hell did he mean by that? It was merely a compliment, Major. Of course! I'll tell that to Corinne. It'll make her happy! You're hiding something. - Are you in love with someone else? - How could I be in love with two? Can you swear on bended knee? Of course I can... I swear here at your feet, that you are the only one! There IS no one else other than you, Corinne! What do you mean by interrupting us?! When I see him down there in front of you...! We were rehearsing. - Rehearsing? - Yes, the third scene. I want a straight answer... Who was that specimen? Specimen?! That's Floridor, who wrote the operetta. Do you rehearse all the scenes together? Yes, the most tender ones! Tender? I'll show him tender! Damnation! Musical marauders! They steal some people's music, and other people's wives! How does my wife fit into that? If you hurt him I'll never see you again! Get out! I can't forget what I see. What do you say to that? Me neither. Just calm down. Calm down? If I want to be angry, I'll be angry! When I see you deceiving me with that... Flower-door! Floridor is his name! I'll deal with him! Hello, have you seen that Flower-door? No. he was here, but he just ducked out. That insect ran away, of course! - You don't know where he's gone? - I don't have a clue. If you see him, you can tell him from me... ...that his ears are gone! Gone?! Of course he has ears! Not when I've finished with him! No, I'm going to chop his ears off! What ever are you doing, my child? I always do my morning gymnastics like this. In the mornings. You should do that out in the fresh air. Go and join your friends. Lessons start soon. What are you reading? "Gloria in Excelsis..." that we're singing on Sunday. Very good, but don't work too hard. As you wish, Mother. Want to hear a secret? What is it? I don't know if should tell you... It's secret! You haven't committed a sin, have you? I don't know if it's sinful... I've received a letter from a guy. A real guy? Oh... that's shocking! Auguste smuggled it in. So you can get personal letters? That's so terrible! What did he write? He writes that he's at the Sorbonne, and it's all going well for him. He's reading Latin, and doing very well in it. Then he wrote about the other boys, too. 200 students... all of them boys! Just boys...! 200! What else did he write? Then he wrote... "With kindest regards"... That sounds just like love.! What would YOU know about love? "Of all the nice things, our planet does bring, Love is by far the greatest thing." - Do you really feel that? - It sounds good. I believe Auguste who says... "Love is an itch in your heart..." ..."that you're never able to scratch." Break time is over. It's off to the classroom. Who's that? Is that you, Auguste? Why are you here? I'm snoozing. Have you been here all night? Yes... It was because if anyone came, they'd think it was you sleeping here.. Brilliant! May Madonna protect you, for all you've done for me. For you? isn't it also for me? I'll talk with the Madonna... Who can that be? Mother of God... It's the prioress! Who is it? I was just wondering how you were feeling. Thank you, I'm feeling a lot better. It wasn't German measles. I really am feeling a lot better. I just wanted to remind you of your singing lesson in 15 minutes. I'll be there well in time. Can you see where the major kicked me? Sure can. Why did he kick you? I was at the Theatre in Corinne's room. I was down on my knees before her. The major was coming in as I was going out. As we passed each other... that was when he kicked me. Fancy getting kicked by a major! Still has to be dusted off. I should have lost my sweetheart, if I'd taken the major to task... ...so I just stormed out. But what were you doing at the Theatre? I was rehearsing. - Rehearsing? - Yes. I've written an operetta which I've had accepted. That will be played in a public Theatre? Yes, that's right. It'd be stupid otherwise. Stupid? But think about it... What if the prioress found out? Impossible... No way she know anything. I am divided into two diametrically opposed personalities... On the one side I am... Celestin, organist in the priory... ...on the other side, Floridor, master of light entertainment. Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. Up in the Theatre, Floridor, but out in the cloister, Celestin Quite shameless is our Floridor... unlike respectable Celestin If you should meet our Floridor... and when you meet our Celestin... you're not sure if Floridor... ...is Floridor, not Celestin For Celestin is Floridor and Floridor is Celestin! Wait while I tell the prioress that you're here. Good morning. Don't look so scared... I'm not a ghost! I'm sorry, Major, but the unusual sight of a dragoon in the priory had me confused. Are you seeking to escape the world and reside here? That would be a laugh... me in a nunnery! Don't look so scared... I shan't eat you! But if you happened to be Floridor I'd chop your ears off! Major... within these peaceful walls... Regardless! Mr Organist, you wouldn't happen to know a musician named Floridor? - Who'd you say? - Floridor. I'm sorry, no. Is he in your regiment? No, he writes operettas and such. He's an exploiter! Good heavens! Would you expect to find him here? I always thought you musicians knew each other. Of course, but... I don't know anyone of such low standing. Anything else I can help you with? Yes, you can see if you can find my sister, the prioress. I need to talk with her. Oh. yes, of course With the greatest pleasure, Brother. Thanks. This way, my brother. The prioress is waiting in the reception room. Thank you, Sister. So tell me why you're here. It's about one of your girls, Miss Denise de Flavigny. Her parents, the Baron and Baroness de Flavigny... want to marry her off to one of my officers. I'm here to find out... what she's like. Is she beautiful? Oh, Denise...! She's so quiet and shy. She always walks with downcast eyes. She really sets an example to the other girls. Might the young man meet with her? The rules forbid any man to come within the walls of the priory. But I could come in. That's different, you being my brother. And your age is a guarantee of your virtue. Thanks for the compliment! So you're saying he can't meet her? He can come here. He can talk with Denise, but not see her. - Then so shall it be. - It's only what's proper. I'll let him know this. Girls... it's time for lessons! - We are ready, Brother. - Have you mixed up the music? I did borrow some music, but I put it back in the right order. Yes, here it is! Here's the music. That's not it. I want "Veni creator spiritus". The prioress is coming! The cloister gives us quiet and peace All worldly contact here must cease All are kept firmly in hand Every single thing is planned This sacred place, a woman's station free from male machination whose evil goal is ever just to ill abuse a woman's trust. Deep inside these peaceful walls we cannot hear the sinners' calls When the steel gate closes for the night... we're all in bed, and tucked in tight Thank you children. Thank you Mr Celestin. You are an excellent teacher. You really do inspire your pupils. It makes me so happy to be able to say that. Mr Celestin! Mr Celestin! I'm just expressing my gratitude. Now children, you may have a half-hour break. May I ask... About what? I would like to take my break here... and work with my mother, dear Brother. I mean my brother, dear Mother. - You work too much. - But I love to work. Why is that? Afterwards, a reward awaits... an encouraging word from you. And that's what you call a reward? That's the way I am, Mother dear. Thank you, dear child. You can sing with Mr Celestin, but just for a little while. Then I need to talk with you. I'll wait for you in my room. Mr Celestin.... Denise would like to practice singing, under your tutelage, for while longer. That's very nice of her. You should be proud, Mr Celestin... that I leave this chaste young creature in your hands. Naturally... You are not entrusting your lambs to some wolf. I know that, Brother. Is there something I can pass on? The major has already done that. I'll wait for an answer. I'll tell her that you're here. Will it be a long vocal practice? I just want to do "Gloria in excelsis". You want to learn it? I'd just like you to listen to it. That will be all, then? Yes, that will be... all. I'm ready, Brother.. I'm also ready, Sister. Gloria in excelsis praeserva... Sorry, that was a mistake... that "tumtara-tum, tumtara-tum"... It might put us in between. We'll take it from the start again... Gloria in excelsis praeserva... - What did you say/ - Nothing. Somebody has altered my notes here! Someone has altered...? And it was you! - No! - Yes! How did you get my score? Yesterday when I borrowed the music, I took the opportunity to... And you're supposed to be a little saint! What would the prioress say if I told her? - You wouldn't! - I would. No! What would you think she'd say if she hears that the priory organist... has written an operetta that will open at the Theatre tonight? Quiet! Not so loud. How do you know this? I found a newspaper amongst the music. So you're going to the Theatre? Of course. How do you get there? How do I get out? That's my little specialty. I'll explain... I sneak through the garden to the bench by the wall... up on the bench... ...pull up onto the top of the wall, look around, jump down. But how do you get back? The same way, from the other side. Exactly! - No, it won't work. - What won't work? To get out in this dress. I'd really love to see your operetta... I understand, but unfortunately... It won't work. Don't make eyes at me. It won't work! No, impossible. It'd be such fun to see an operetta that I knew already.. I read it last night. No! Tell me, what did you think? I think it's brilliant! Really?! Let me tell you there are things in it... that no composer has written before. One can hope so. The duet between the princess and the tin soldier is wonderful. Really? I love it too. But at the end, the text doesn't work. At the end? You mean... That's not sung, it's sneezed. Tralalalalala...achoo! Could we sneeze it, just once? I'll go and prepare that little child. But you have to remember... You must act with the calm and dignity... ...that befits your age and status, and NOT mention marriage at all. Rest assured, Prioress. - He was the handsomest soldier - in all His Majesty's troop - The princess really loved that chap - When he came, she'd start to whoop In dreams of him, she had her pleasure His image was always in her mind She looked on him so tenderly But he could not reply in kind So he remained both cold and thin... and never would respond - The explanation being... Yes my friend, yes my friend That young soldier was made of tin! Gloria in excelsis praeserva nos a maleficiis Very good, my child... But music is a worldly art. It may be a sin to love it too much. Should you wish it, dear Mother, I'll not sing any more. That "Little Saint" is a little devil! What a horrid thing to say! Extremely horrid! Leave us Mr Celistin. I need to have a few words with the dear child. Very well. The dear child can never get too much of your wisdom. Thank you. You realise that's a compliment. That's me, Little Mamma... I mean... Dear Mother. The university inspector wants to interview our best student. And that is you. Me? But the priory rules... Don't worry, you only need hear his voice. Ask the inspector to come here. Mother, won't the inspector ask me worldly questions? Those I can't answer. He's a very honourable older man. I'm still uneasy. Calm down now, dear child. Heavens to Betsy, I'm nervous! I'm ready to begin the interview! Quiet! You must be more dignified. Don't forget what you agreed to.. Rest assured, Prioress! Miss...! Sir...! Tell me, Miss, how your day passes in the priory school. Very well... We start with a devotional song. Then we have a hearty breakfast, with whole-grain bread. Then a short time in the park. That sounds good. Go on. Then we sew clothes for the poor children. Then we have lunch, with whole-grain bread. Then we rest for a couple of hours. That sounds even better... Go on. - Then we have supper... - With whole-grain bread? Then we hit the sack. "Go to bed," you say. Yes, I know, Dear Mother. We can't talk to a man, about "bed". In some cases, my daughter. I'll proceed to some questions, my daughter. Go ahead, good sir. What do you know about 'The Memoirs of Casanova'? It's been so long since I read them! Sister, this gentleman is indecent! Most indecent! Now, now, calm down, child! No questions about worldly literature! I do have to question her. Ask her about priory stories. Do you read Boccaccio's "Decameron"? Good heavens! No questions about old novels! My daughter... What do you know about Julius Caesar? Julius Caesar...? Julius Caesar, Roman statesman and leader who lived 102-44 BC. Then he fell victim to a plot and said, "You too, my Brutus?" Caesar also appeared in a tragedy by William Shakespeare... Shakespeare lived 1564 to 1616 Among his best-known works are... Very good... I'm satisfied. I'd like you to sing something for me. Mother, should I sing? Certainly, my child. Hallelujah! We all thank thee... for all thy gifts of love All the sinners who repent... forgiveness do we promise Hallelujah! So carefully we step... along life's thorny path. And if we falter... and so succumb... forgive us, and forgive me too! Hallelujah! Have you ever thought, young lady... No, never. Have YOU? I mean... ...have you ever thought that you may not always be in this priory? Yes... But the thought of it fills me with sadness. Very good, my child. Have you ever thought that one day you may be married? Have I! Sister, he asked if I shall be married! No harm in that! How would you know about that? I don't want to be here! What sort of person talks about marriage? But I really must see her! Now, now... calm yourself down! Remember our agreement! Then I'll have to see her at her home. - What's this? - From her parents. I shall possibly be advising your parents... that my interview with you has given me great satisfaction. Goodbye, my child. Goodbye Inspector. It's not easy pretending to be an inspector at a priory school. Did you gain anything from the visit, Lieutenant? Did I...! I'm head over heels in love! I'll soon do something about it. Sister Marianne! See the inspector out. Beloved child... I have an important message. You have to leave for Paris today. Paris?! Oh... Such an awful sinful place! I understand your feelings, child. To abandon this peaceful abode for the world outside... Mother, can it be that I must leave what I love? What'll I do in Paris?! My poor child, it's hard for me to say this... Tell me, Mother... I'll take it like a man. You'll be married. Me, married?! No! Who's the unlucky man? You'll find out in Paris. Right away? Cry as much as you like, child. Say goodbye to your friends. Mr Celestin will accompany you to Paris. You sweet child! Anyone else would be happy to go out in the world..., ...but you want to stay. That's how I am, Dear Mother. Mr Celestin... Mr Celestin! Prioress...? Are you still unwell? No, quite the opposite. You seem to sneeze a lot. That was just to shake up the system. You have to accompany Denise to Paris. You have to go with her on the train. But it can't happen! It's impossible! I'll let you know about the train. But me, alone with the young lady... It shows the extent of my respect for you. Thank you, but... Bear in mind, I'm a young man... If my parents got to know I was with a young... Make sure you get away. Right now I need a glass of Benedictine! I said that if I'd become a monk... that would have been my liqueur. Receptionist! We need a room. - Double or twin beds? - How shameful! We don't need a bed. We're leaving for Paris in 2 hours. But in the meantime... No, Floridor! Are you going away? Surely you'll be at the premiere? Yes of course... Corinne will be distraught if you don't come. Imagine if she hears you've gone away with this little piece of fluff! - Say nothing! - Calm down pet! If I get a role next time, I shan't say a word! Any role you want! Goodbye, Floridor! G'bye. There you are... Room 13. What would the prioress say about all the things my innocent eyes are seeing? Innocent! If she knew that her "Little Saint"... ...had been forced into a hotel room. - Room 13... - Yes. You'll sit here quietly all evening, while I’m away. Understood?. You talk to me as though I were a dog. I don't trust you. Best to lock you in. No key, but that can be arranged! What shall I do all evening? You'll find something... whatever ladies do with their time... Thumb through a picture book, dance around... It would be best, for your sake, that I came with you. What do you mean? At least there'll be ONE person to get you a curtain call. And then we take the night train to Paris! Just understand... Remember that I'm a respectable gentleman! So it will be as I have said. One should be married to you, and live far from the pharmacy. I'd never marry a saint, even if they lived near a pharmacy. Goodbye! They WERE married! Where are you from, Miss? The Little Swallows Priory. It seems you may have fallen out of the nest a little too early. We can't spend the rest of our lives on a perch. My husband had locked me in. He's so absent-minded... He forgot I was there. Thank you. Thanks. A little souvenir. Thank you very much! The Little Swallows Priory? A cute bird, anyway! What did I tell you... Success! Fantastic! Don't forget I was the one behind the production of the operetta. With my money, of course! Congratulations... Oh, so many flowers! You should have seen me in Paris. I had a whole carriage full! Was that pompous major there too? You won't need to buy flowers now. Buy my own? I never have to! Calm down now! With this success, Paris will be summoning us! Hasn't Floridor come? Yes, where's the great Floridor? He'll be here for the second act. There's a lot you can thank Floridor for. That's right... I have a great surprise in store for him... ...Nothing short of a colossal sensation! Are you thinking of paying him royalties? No, better than that...! I've had a laurel wreath hanging in the attic for 50 years. My father bought it when the great Paganini was supposed to come. Oh, Paganini! Paganini was a great violinist. And a great lover! Grandma told me about him. He never came. Maybe he stayed with grandma. But the wreath is there still! Imagine the great Paganini's wreath on Floridor's head... Magnificent! And cost you nothing. I shall ensure that it comes down. Just you wait and see. Your Floridor is quite a flirt. - I don't believe it. - Really? We saw him a little while ago with a pretty young girl. You're lying! I'm the one he loves. Just like the others. We all know what great musicians are like. Well, he's too great to be interested in the likes of you... You lying upstart! How dare you...! Are you ladies squabbling? No, we get along ever so well with each other. So, the gentlemen are here? Welcome! Is it true that you're travelling? Yes, in a few hours. To Paris. The poor chap's getting married! Really? Is she tall? Tall and maybe heavy. I still haven't seen her. "The old fox is a cunning chap Who seldom falls into a trap". And you fell into the trap! Good evening ladies, gentlemen... Has anyone seen my wife? She'd be in her dressing room. We've just given her our congratulations. Great! She always enjoys congratulations. And she knows if they're genuine. - Thank you gentlemen! - Thank you, Major! Listen, my girl... After what happened, it's over between us. I should hope so! Goodbye...! my girl. Goodbye, Sir. You're more brazen than I thought! Anyone else would have given an explanation. I've explained. It's up to you to beg Floridor's pardon. Should I apologise to him, after you've betrayed me with him?! Not in my lifetime! I'd rather commit Mata Hari! It's called "harakiri". I don't no about that. I'll do Mata Hari. If you let me go without believing me, it's over forever! IF I should beg Floridor's pardon... ...would you put it down to noble-mindedness, or stupidity? That would be generous of you. No, I can't do it! I can’t apologise to that little milksop! I must uphold my position as an officer. As you wish! I SHALL apologise. I SHALL degrade myself, because... Because I love you. A kiss... That kiss knew where it was going! One more? - So, how's it going? - Brilliantly! - How was Corinne? - Brilliant! She was asking after you. Hello! Have you seen Floridor? No... ask those gentlemen. It seems it's a brilliant success. Yes, thanks to Floridor! I need to talk to him. Whereabouts is he? He's probably up with Corinne. Of course you'll join me for supper afterwards? I'd love to, but I can't. Quite impossible. - Is it true what they're saying? - Saying what? That you're with another woman. Me?! How can you believe I'd do such a thing? Don't try to bamboozle me! You're just a poly... poly... Polygamist? No, I assure you, Corinne! Surely you believe me more than their gossip? - But who shall I believe? - You must believe ME. Corinne, I swear that you are the only one I love! Was that the third scene again? What do you mean by that? You have to apologise to Floridor! I just kicked him out of force of habit. I'll call him. Mr Corridor! Mr Corridor! Floridor looked as though he'd just faced a cavalry charge! Mr Floridor! Can you tell me where I might find Mr Floridor? No, sorry, I don't. No, but I'd be happy to make your acquaintance. No, I've just come here to see his operetta. So you know Mr Floridor? Of course. Maybe you know him well? You wouldn't be married to him? However did you guess, Lieutenant? Intuition. Let me accompany you backstage and we'll look for him. Well... do I dare? Lt Fernand de Champlatreux... You'll be under the protection of the French army. I'm sure I’ll be calm about that! - What is this? - The stage... - And this? - The sets. So that's what they are! Have you never been on a stage? No, I haven't, and my husband doesn't want me to be here. But I know the whole operetta. I love Theatre! And may not be part of it? How could anyone be so hard-hearted against such a delightful wife!? Every time he has a premiere, he locks me in. I'd be there all evening... But I sneaked out. And here I am now, without a ticket... Madame, the army guarantees that even this can be arranged. Thank you kindly, Lieutenant. How should us women get by without the army?! I've searched the whole place. There's no sign of that musical marauder! Don't glare at me like that! I really am regretful. Apologise first, and then I'll see... You're a hard-hearted woman... but so sweet. I SHALL beg his pardon. Corinne! Hurry up, you'll be on soon! Would you have just one seat free? No, not a single one free. For Madame. Sorry, Madame, it's sold out.. May I present Madame Floridor, who's just arrived from Paris to see her husband. Floridor! Oh Madame, I shall arrange a seat right away! I've never heard such audacity! He's going to regret this! Tell the major I wish to see him right away! What's up with her? She's jealous. Of me?! Is my husband deceiving me? I don't think so. Certainly not with her. Why not with her? Beside you, madame, she is nothing more than a little... vixen. A vixen? That sounds rather dangerous! But I'm a girl who doesn't give in easily! I can't find Floridor, so I can't apologise. Should YOU apologise? He's deceived me with HER! He's deceived me with you! He's married to her! He's deceived US! Then I'll run him through! He's not worth it. Come along, Alfred. Couldn't I stab him just a little bit? Where are you going? The curtain is about to go up. Aren't you getting changed? No, I shan't go on stage! I'll never set foot in your disgusting Theatre again! No, we're not going to act, we're not going to change...! And we shan't set our disgusting feet, in your old Theatre ever again. Yes, that's what I said... disgusting feet! Good gracious! It's all over... I'm ruined! Corinne is due on stage! Corinne has gone off in a temper! It's a total disaster! Hold the curtain! All my dreams up in smoke! - Wait with the curtain! - What's wrong? - Corinne's not going on. - Not gong on?! No, she's resigned and gone off! Run after her... Get on your knees and beg her! Calm down... I'll talk to her. Why isn't Corinne performing? Why? Because she's run off! I can take her role! You? It's a singing role! We have to come up with something! Think of something! You'll help them! Madame Floridor knows the whole operetta! Thank heavens! I'm saved! But I can't do it, because my husband... Please! Please! You have to save the show! Our livelihood’s at stake! Dearest Madame, the fate of the Theatre is in your hands. I beg you! I implore you! - You'll be helping your husband. - That's why. I shall help you... But you have to introduce me as... - "Mlle Nitouche". - "Miss Saint"? Splendid! Find her a dress... The right sort of dress! Go and announce this great sensation! I don't have a dress suit. You can borrow mine. Better have gloves, too. They're in the pocket. So when you come on stage, you say "Ladies and gentlemen..." "As a result of our primadonna Corinne having broken her leg..." "...broken her contract...!" "therefore we have..." You'll figure out something. Work out something. I can't go on with just one glove! Hold the other hand behind your back. - Which back? - Your back! Now hurry up! Don't forget what you have to say. I'm shaking like a leaf! Hand behind your back! Ladies and gentlemen! Our primadonna... ...has suddenly broken the leg of her contract... That's to say... She has been summoned on military matters... She's got a major! She's had a major summons... It is force majeur! Mlle Nitouche has agreed to take over the major... the role. She is a very talented actress, who I can warmly recommend. How charming! I don't dare! We'll do some of the songs, then you'll feel calmer. I'm shaking like a leaf. A bit of stage-fright never hurt. Cadet and Babet left a party in the middle of the night As the forest slumbered, the stars were shining bright Shadows interwove with moonbeams on every flower and stalk... Tralala, tralala tralala... It was a lovely walk! I'm afraid, said young Cadet Not I, said Miss Babet Tralala, trelala, I'm not at all, said Miss Babet. Corinne is dead, long live Nitouche! Come on, we have to hurry! It's all your fault. I've never been so nervous in my life. You're going to be brilliant, Madame. Can you help me get away afterwards? I have to go to Paris. I'll accompany you to wherever you like. I'm already in seventh heaven. Can one get from there to Paris? I really must be in Paris tomorrow. So do I. We can travel together. Hold my hand... I'm so nervous. Mlle Nitouche! Holy Mother of God, please stand beside me! Calm yourself down now... That feels better, doesn't it? But I'll get nervous again! Oh no! I'm not THAT nervous! Has Miss Corinne come yet? No sign of her. Corinne, what have you done? I could have achieved greatness! There's the start of it... The start of a scandal! What's happening? This is crazy!! It's so wonderful! Get off there...! We have to catch the train! Get back on stage! You can't! You're making me very unhappy Thank you so much for this success! Whose idea was this?! I discovered this star! I'll show you stars...! Rescue me! I'll take you away from this nest of vipers! What if they call for the author! Maybe I should go on... Author! Author! I'm coming! - What will your husband say? - Goodness knows. He'll want you to himself for the trip to Paris. You'd debut there, would you? Everyone wants to make it in Paris. He's played his queen of hearts at the right moment. But he can be trumped by a joker... I hope I see you soon. Me too. I'm on the 12 o'clock train to Paris. I'm on the same train. Once it happened in the parade... Basso, the big bass drummer was beating A lovely lady walking by took every man's heart by storm How beautiful she is! said the flautist... See how she flashes her eyes at us "She smiles pertly," said the trumpeter She's looking for a cavalier But Basso Couldn't see her The bass drum thrust out to hide her Bom! Bom! Bom! - He wanted to see her too Bom! Bom! Bom! I have to beat this drum Bom! Bom! Fate deals musicians her poorest hand... But still the drummers beats boom out They sought to see where she might dwell and played a little louder and confided amongst themselves how they might visit One, two, three were seen disappearing... French horns, flute and clarinet to compete for who will first be able to arrange a quick duet Outside the gate Basso stood and swore The bass drum, alas, was far too big! Bom! Bom! Bom! It was only to be expected! Bom! Bom! Bom! Such a clumsy instrument! Bom! Bom! Fate deals musicians her poorest hand... But still the drummer's beats boom out So it went on for several days and Basso had to stand outside But then in the end he complains so, he manages also to be heard One of his comrades promises to guard the big bass drum. And Basso goes, among the guests, to give his tribute to the beauty. He steps inside, only to find... ...the beauty is his own dear wife! Bom! Bom! Bom! It beats as it always does Bom! Bom! Bom! He beats the big drum! Bom! Bom! Fate deals musicians her poorest hand... But still the drummer's beats boom out Madame Floridor, I can't describe how enchanted I am with you. Well don't try to. I have to run now. - I'll wait for you. - No, think of my husband. See you on the train. What a success! Floridor was called back 7 times. I've made my decision. I shall not get married! Damn it! Lower the wreath! Open up! I'll chop your ears off! I don't have time. Come back tomorrow. I don't have time tomorrow Open the door! Elderly majors shouldn't carry on like that. - Can you fight? - No! So come out! No, come in. It's really nice in here. You here?! Denise de Flavigny, cadet in the 4th dragoon regiment! At your service. You haven't got changed. There's someone else... Get that uniform off! I can't very well travel stark-naked! Go as you wish. We have to move... The train leaves in half an hour! Open up! I'll go out and talk to him. No, he's the prioress's brother. So how are we going to get out of here? I'll have to knock him to the ground. No! Imagine if you were to kill him! You're right. I shouldn't take the risk. Thanks very much. I have an idea... Open, before I break the door down! Good evening, Major! No, that's impossible! Where do you think you're going? To Paris, General. General?! Sorry, I get nervous when I see stripes. At least he's not the major. - Where are you coming from now? - From inside. So... Breaking in?!? The opposite. Breaking out! So you're trying to escape! We're traveling to Paris to get married. Not to each other of course. We'll have to check that out. By the left... Quick march! Can you explain? Do we turn left? Enough chat!` Forward march! Where's the watch officer? He's out... Off duty? drinking... in the mess, I mean. I'll lock them up for now. Forward... march! Miss de Flavigny in the clink...! This should never have happened. How shall we get out of this? What's the time? - One o'clock. - One?! We're catching the 12 o'clock train! We can't catch the midnight train when it's one o'clock! So I'll miss seeing him! Calm down and stop being silly. If you miss one lieutenant, there are thousands more. None like him. Yes, me,... if I were a lieutenant. But who am I... Maybe a Herve, maybe an Offenbach! Maybe nothing. I want to talk with Lieutenant Champlatreux! We're on speaking terms. You have to wait till it's your turn to be interrogated! Well, here we are... In a bit of a pickle. Yes, the end of the line. I lose my job and you lose your fiance. I think I'll get married anyway, now that I've met HIM. Tell me everything...! How does a man in love feel? Terrible! Your whole body aches. Then I must be in love! I have a lump in my throat... and a pain in my heart. I'm tender all over my body. Are you like that too? Then you're also in love. And tender... here. But not from love.. Even there, love can be found. Has anything happened? Two arrests. One, a cadet. - Who is he? - Don't know. He asked to see you, Lieutenant. What are they going to do with us? Probably beheading. I sort of feel like Marie Antoinette. Terrible story... Such a fresh young thing! This is also turning out to be a tragedy. I'll be alright... if HE is here. Alright for you... What about me? Why would you pretend to be my wife? Corinne could have helped me, remember. Everything gets reported to the prioress. So that's the thanks I get for saving your silly operetta! You sure learned it quickly. Well I'd heard the music beforehand. What do we have here?! Why are Mr and Mrs Floridor inside on such a lovely evening? Yes, it would be nicer... Can you help us to get out, Lieutenant? What have they done? Breaking in, escaping, making noise after hours... You'd think we were the worst criminals in the whole country. Please help us, Lieutenant! Certainly. You're free to go. But first you must have a drink with me and my friends. I'm off to Paris in the morning. Are you getting promoted? No, quite the contrary. I'm getting married. Really? Married? Then we certainly must have a drink with them. Isn't that so, hubby dear? "Hubby dear" can't. I have to go now! You too! Hubby, my pet... Since we've missed the train can't we accept and then go in the morning? Impossible! We have to leave now! This is my last evening as a bachelor. Know how that feels? Yes, I imagine you're overjoyed. No, quite the contrary. Not since I met you... What do you mean? Well... you're married. Not at all! I only said that so as to get into the Theatre! What?! Then everything is fine! Fine? I was so unhappy when you didn't come for the midnight train. I was unavoidably detained. So what are YOU doing in Paris? Same as you... getting married. Do you love your intended? I don't know him. Just like with me! But I've decided not to go! I'm not going either... Darling! ...until the day after tomorrow. You just dare! What are you doing here? Manning my post. But we don't have guard posts inside the barracks do we?! New order. Ridiculous! What's the broom for? Instead of a rifle. How stupid is that?! According to orders. To save wearing out the rifles. Stupidity! What's your name? - Fergott. - Tell me your name! That's my name... Fergott. I know your face... Impossible... I only just started here. I'm being demobbed or whatever it's called. Hey there! Come back here! What's that? My beautiful hair that I'm so proud of. - Had it long? - Yes, I was born with it. I don't like recruits with long hair. We all have our different tastes. Attention! I want this sheep shorn! His hair is to be quite short! No, Major! I can't go home with my hair cut! Not all cut off! Prepare him for court-martial! Hey, get me a pair of sheep shears! Is Fernand going to Paris with Mlle Nitouche? Yes, he fell madly in love with her. What an extraordinary accident, the day before he was to get married! Good evening, gentlemen! Good heavens! What a time to show up! Do you realise how long we've been waiting? I can explain..: I have met the world's most enchanting woman... May I present to you... "Mlle Nitouche" from the Theatre. Welcome, Mlle Nitouche! We have gathered here this evening... ...for a farewell drink to Fernand who is soon on his way to Paris. ...where he'll be hitching with a new comrade. I've changed my plans. Let us drink instead to Mlle Nitouche... who's honouring our mess. Thank you... ...comrades! Gentlemen, here's to Mlle Nitouche! Here's to the 4th Dragoon Regiment! Gentlemen, "The Reveille Song"! The night has fled, by our beloved's side we pray until the day has dawned Listen, a trumpet gives the signal. Awaken both regiments, General Duty now calls the lieutenant... A kiss from the lieutenant is taken... A kiss! O, you heavenly man Don't go Stay just a while! You're happiest here, after all... I've orders. I can't be arrested! Young maidens, when you choose a man, remember this... ...he flies each morn at reveille... if he is a soldier When morning breaks, he flies from his wife, when the trumpet blasts. Good evening, gentlemen! I see you're enjoying yourselves, gentlemen! Yes, Major! It's a farewell drink for Lt Champlatreux. So it seems. You have your cap on?! Don't you know better? No.... this is the first time I've been here. Name? Denis...etti. Donizetti. I know that name... Are you related to the big composer... ...who wrote "Daughter of the Regiment"? That was my grandfather. He was a big man. A very big man Over 2 metres tall. How would you know that, cadet? My...my dad told me. So he knew your grandfather? How interesting! Come and sit down and have a drink. I'll have a widow [Veuve Clicquot] That's the only woman we allow in here. Where were we? At home with my grandfather. That's right! Was your father also musical? Yes, he was a drummer... Ever since he was this big. - What did he become after that? - He became taller. No you mustn't do it! Think about my talent! Finished shearing him? But I'm a civilian! But I'm a musician, a composer. I'm unable to compose without long hair. And it gets so cold! Poor little devil! Have a drink? Where did she go... he go... the cadet? To the officers' mess. I have to speak with her.. him. Off you go then. That way. But wait... Do you want your hair? Who does the horse belong to? The lieutenant. He's in the mess. Would you like a drink? I'll take your watch, then. Tell me, lad... Where did you do the exam? At univer... at the Heidelberg Conservatorium. You must have been involved in duels, there? You can say that again! But you've no scars... Oh yes, I have lots of them! I can't see any. Maybe you can't, but they're there. Show us the evidence, lad! We're proud of our exploits here. I have a scar from the 1870-71 war. Off with your jacket! No! I can't undress! It wouldn't be decent Major, the boy is shy. Damnation! A woman in the mess at this hour! What will the colonel say? Attention! I've come unannounced! I shall inspect the regiment. Officer of the day? Put him on report! Yes, Colonel! Major, discipline here is terrible. Prepare for a major interrogation! What have I done? I'll tell you later. Cadet, you go and take the guard. Wait there till I give the order. - Understood? - Understood. Major interrogation? What does that mean? A major interrogates a major? Is it about split personality? Why have you officers made such a mess of things?! Attention! Is it obvious that we're dressed as dragoons? It may be a bit noticeable. Hopefully no one wakes up...! What'll the prioress say?! We can't have been to Paris. Hurry in and get changed! My clothes are all at the hotel! I’m sure you'll manage to find something, Mr Floridor. I'm Mr Celestin! - We'd best make a move. - We can't stay here. This is the last time I go running around with a little saint! - Mr Celestin! - Prioress! You're home already? Yes, Prioress, I'm home. So it seems! What are you wearing? It's a temporary sort of thing... A simple thing... I wear it for travelling. It's not attractive, but it's comfy. It gets so sooty on the trains... Terribly. What have you done with your hair? You've been shorn! Shorn, yes. Yes, I did it to pass the time waiting at the station. !0 minutes here, 10 minutes there, the time adds up. And the barber needs to make a living... Mr Celestin, what have you done with Denise? You can't have had time to get to Paris and back. Prioress, I totally agree with what you say. It's impossible to return, unless you've already left! That's true. If anything has happened to Denise... Have you considered my brother is a major? Yes, in fact I thought of that the whole time. Come! Is he here?! No, but he may be coming. Tell me, where is Denise? Prioress... I shall explain everything. Mother! Dear child! What happened about Paris? You have to tell me everything. - Yes, it's all very simple... - Extremely simple! I came back because I never went. What do you mean? I asked Mr Celestin if a person should only ever marry for love... - That's right, and I said... - Yes, he said... And I stick by it. He said there's nothing in the world greater than love... ...and that one should always follow one's heart. - Exactly what I said. - Yes, and I think so too. Then I wept so profusely.... I've never seen such a profusion of tears! It was terrible. and then I begged and begged him to take me home. Yes. "And thus endeth today's lesson." Mother, I don't want to marry! I just want to stay here in the priory. Oh, my dear child! That's the way I am, Mother dear. I can't admonish you. Go now and write to your parents on your decision. I'll have it posted. And we, Mr Celestin... ...shall then have a discussion. Mother, don't judge my brother too harshly. Go now, child. For the child's sake I shan't be too hard on you. But go now and change into something more fitting. And let your hair grow. I don't like short hair. On the other hand, the major doesn't like long hair. What?! It was just an association of ideas. Go now, and don't forget what I said. No, Prioress, I shall allow my hair to grow, right away. I shall inform my sister that you're marrying a songstress. You can never tell with that nun. Maybe she's felt left on the shelf for years. She might make difficulties. Maybe, but the girl is said to be very pretty. But actresses...! No, I've known too many. No doubt conducting "artistic studies". I've known Theatre primadonnas. They're nothing but trouble. When I think about Corinne... ...I become so angry, my flesh crawls! That poor child doesn't want to marry. But that's wonderful! The bridegroom doesn't want to, either. I came to let you know about that. Well what do you know! I'll tell the dear child right away. She's going to be so delighted! She'll include you in her prayers! Imagine being mentioned in prayers of thanks! Hail, sister... Help! A man! Who are you, little girlie? Peekaboo! Why do you hide so much beauty? Shall we lift up the veil...? No, leave me alone... I'm so shy. Surely I could just get a little kiss... No, go away I say. I'm an innocent girlie. Really? There she is...! What do you mean? She was dancing cancan in the mess last night! An her with the short hair was also there. Have you lost your mind?! ...in excelsis praeserva nos a maleficiis... I'm very sorry, ladies... I seem to have been hallucinating. It was that short-cut hair that set me off... I remember I clipped someone last night. Major, I have recently taken monastic vows. Where did I put them? I hope you're convinced now. Yes, I guess I am. Then present your case to the young lady. Of course... Miss...! I know very well that my sister has explained everything. His motives cannot be hurtful to you personally... ...seeing you haven't met each other. In a nutshell... He's in love with someone else. That's wonderful! I also love someone else. Really?! I must say that having met you... ...I realise that he's making the biggest mistake of his life. Can you imagine what the other girl is! An actress! - An actress? - Shameful! How can you say the word in front of our saint? Quite a dreadful state of affairs... ...if I say so myself. Mother, I still don't understand anything. She had her debut in an operetta by the great Floridor. - Oh, Major... sir! - Beg pardon? I said "Oh Major". What is the young man's name? Fernand de Champlatreux. - I had an inkling! - Just like in the Theatre. How do you wish to respond, Miss? It's not nice of me to simply reject the young man... ...without explaining to him personally. But he has pulled out of it himself! You say he was in love with an actress? Yes, Nitouche is her name. That's French for "Saint". Don't no how appropriate...! Artist's privilege. Is he going to marry her? No, decorum would forbid it! Piffle! Decorum?! Mother, seeing I'm not marrying the young man... ...I feel I should still do something for him. Couldn't I just speak with him? Isn't she just a little saint?! Come on brother, let's fetch the young man. Now you're in a mess! What's it matter, when it's HIM?! "When it's HIM?" How are you going to sort out this mess? I'm pondering that very thing, my sister. Good luck! How am I going to save myself from this labyrinth, in the end? Denise had her wings burnt when she flew out of the nest Oh Sainte Nitouche... my holy protector help me please to win a victory Help me secure my officer so I never need be... ...in the priory any more! Good morning, Miss! Don't touch the screen! That was the agreement. I shan't break the rules. Such a pity... What? Such a pity with these rules. Miss... I'm told you stepped back from marrying me... because I was in love with another? Yes. Are you going to marry her? Unfortunately it's impossible. But nothing will stop me loving her more than anything in the world. Are you quite sure about that? I was never surer of anything. Then I wish you every happiness. Mr Floridor, let's talk this over... Are YOU going to marry the one you love? I don't know, but I couldn't wish for anything more. But I don't believe he wants to. Why wouldn't he want to? I've done so many stupid things. - Because you were nervous? - No. What stupid things...? Tell me about them! Yes. I had a feeling it was you! I've known the whole time. Darling! Stop! None of your business. Carry on! Very good, Major! Mr Floridor... I know everything! Did Corinne tell you that... Yes. That there was never anything between you. She asked me if I thought she'd ever fall in love with such a... Flibbertigibbet. - How do you know that? - It's her favourite expression. Enjoy your lives, my children! Remember, she's the most fragile and innocent flower of all. Congratulations, young lady! Pity we didn't know about it when you danced cancan at the mess. We could've celebrated the engagement with yet another bottle of champagne! - Forgive me, sister dear! So it's true you were at the mess! I wanted to see what my life would be like before I bound myself. You're such a clever child! That's the way I am, Mother dear. That's the way HE is, Mother dear! Subtitles by FatPlank for KG
