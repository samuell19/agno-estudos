Val music] ♪ ♪ [upbeat music] -good morning, abby! -Good morning, sean. It's going to be a good day. It's a rainless morning in seattle. How's bella? Vet said no fleas, thanks for asking. Mmhm. Your wedding dress? Yep. I don't want the movers anywhere near it. Smart. Peek? Nope. You'll have to wait four weeks. Twenty-eight days, to be exact. So stoked for paris. Today's list, please. Yes. The clothes I shipped last week will arrive in paris the day you land. Ok, perfect. Will they be... Yes, waiting for you in your suite at the ritz. Great, and? The wedding coordinator, francois called from paris. He has a really thick accent but I think he said "flowers splendid." great. Or it might have been "flowers dead." I can't be sure. Oh, let's go with splendid. And? You and edward are scheduled to zoom tonight at 9:00pm with francois to finalize the menu. Perfect. Can I get a hard copy of what he's come up with? On your desk. As of this morning, there are now 287 rsvps. What's french for "panic attack?" 9:00pm? Isn't that a little late for a zoom? 6:00am tomorrow morning, paris time. Right. Sometimes I forget I'm moving nine hours into the future. [bittersweet music] what, is there something else? It's just... I'm going to miss you. Same. And don't worry because you're reassigned to marketing, we'll still be working together, just on opposite sides of the world. Awesome. I am excited. Oh, and I sent you a link for your french marriage license. You and edward just need to docusign. Oh. Are you ok? In all the rush I completely forgot. I can't believe myself sometimes. What is it? I'll need you to access the benton county records portal and download a copy of my divorce decree. I'll need that for the marriage license. Wait, you were married? For less than a month when I was 18. A stupid mistake from my youth. What happened? I woke up one morning to a note on his pillow. He ran off to alaska. You're kidding. What did the note say? Just that he wasn't ready for marriage, something like that. Ouch. So the divorce papers? Maybe you should get on that. Right. [peaceful music] oh hey, in comes my best customer. Morning, luke. Morning, joe. So, listen, is my order ready? You bet. Ah. Here you go. Two cans of oyster white, flat. On your account. Excellent. Thanks, man yeah, I figured you won the bid on that johnson house, considering you changed the order three times already. Well, let's be honest, not the most decisive of clients. Yeah, so I heard. Hey, I also heard about your other painting gig. Not that those clients need a lot of handholding. That bunch? Come on, they're the most decisive clients I've ever worked with, joe. [peaceful music] very nice. I like that. Travis, that is so amazing. But no trees? It's in the future. When all the trees are gone. Oh, ok, I see. That's kind of sad, isn't it? It is what it is. [chuckles] well, I have a great idea. What do you think, we put some beautiful trees in there and maybe it'll spur people to fight for them. Like, inspire them? Exactly like inspire. Give it some thought, bud. Wow. [peaceful music] [vacuum whirring] [knocking at door] pardon me, miss. You know where I can find a good cup of coffee around here? [giggles] bonsoir, mon amour. Bonsoir. Un bisou s'il vous plait. Mm. I've been looking forward to that all day. Do you want to elope, right now? Just find a justice of the peace or a notary public and just get married right now? Notaries can marry people? Apparently. Yes. Hm. No, no, no. Please. Put that down. No more work. No, edward, I have so much I need to do. I know, but you can take a little break. Ugh. So, ruthie scored highest in her class. What? Ruthie, that's great! Mr. Hansen said it was the best sophomore paper he's ever read. Wow. I'm so proud of you, that's fabulous. Look at this, you know, my niece is a writer. But, I also want to ask, how is the music going? I've actually started my own band. Really? It's called ruthie's status update. Of course it is. Of course it is. [laughing] you know, one day we'll say we knew you when. Or in my case, I will say I birthed her when. -[laughs] -[phone chimes] mom, claire and ashley are texting. Can I go? Alright. Just say thanks to your uncle luke first. Thank you for getting my favorite spicy tofu. Bring it in. Thank you. -Bye. Love you. -Love you. Love you too! Ugh. In two years she will be in college. I know. That's crazy. I mean, she's grown up so fast, robin. [sighs] listen, I'm sorry I missed so much of it, I am. Well, you're here now. And thank you, by the way. For what? For being such a great uncle to her. Well, she's a great person. I agree. Single motherhood is its own art form, you know. Oh yeah. And you are frida kahlo. Oh, you're sweet. I think that's my favorite of yours. Oh, really? Yeah. Yeah, mine too. Whatever happened to your idea of living for your art? Um, pipe dream. Well, maybe for now, but you never know where life will take you. Yeah, well, right now robin, life's taken me to the dishwasher. Can you grab your plate? Yes, big brother. [chuckles] edward, you've outdone yourself. Well, I thought it would be nice to have a little picnic before our big call. So, I picked up a few things. A decidedly french theme, I see. -Bien oui, ma cherie! -[abby laughs] to get us in the spirit for our big adventure. And, from what I hear, paris has its share of fine wine too. Hmm. I've heard that too. You know, my dad left my mom when I was three and two years later she met leo and from then on, he was my rock. Always there for me. And, I want to thank you for being there for me too. And for being willing to go along and share this dream with me. There's nowhere on earth I'd rather be than right here with you. You say the nicest things. I know this is going to present some challenges for your work. No, abby, I... I trade online. I can do that from anywhere. A toast. To true love. A journey that starts at forever and ends at never. [glasses clink] that's beautiful. Did you write that? No. I got it from a fortune cookie. Yeah, I had chinese for lunch. [cell phone rings] oh! You know what that means. Time to talk wedding. [chuckles] [both] bonjour, francois! I can't believe the summer festival's been going for 50 years. [small laugh] your mom and dad had their first date there? I know, so did I. Hey, did you hear george bingham died? I did. Yeah, he was our divorce lawyer, you know. Yeah. I wonder how abby is these days. I have no idea. You know, I hear that she's... Getting married? I heard that too. Her mother's been talking about that all over town. Huh. So much for "no idea." and so much for no peace and quiet. [chuckles] our flagship store, in le marais, is nearly complete. And our parisian blend is testing off the charts. We think it's going to be a huge seller. I'm really excited to get up there and get started. I hope you'll all come visit. [applause] [joyful music] ok, sean. Next? Talked to the head mover guy. Your furniture should arrive in France in three weeks. Edward doesn't have any other boxes other than those picked up from your house. Three? I thought we paid to expedite. That is expedited. Rapide. Tres bien. Anything more? Oh, yes. The benton county court doesn't have a copy of your divorce papers. That's odd. Please call them. I did call. A lady named helen looked it up and said she couldn't find them. Helen is my mother's second cousin and while she's a lovely woman, she couldn't find... I'm sure. But she's adamant. Ok, so what now? You won't like this. You have to appear. -Appear where? -In court. You're joking. It's a benton county regulation. Both parties have to appear in person in front of the magistrate. I'm afraid you have to do it if you want to get married in paris or anywhere, for that matter. I'm going to see luke. Pardon? Nothing. When? This is crazy. Why can't they just issue me another... Divorce thingy? Why do I have to waste two days when I don't have two minutes to spare? I agree. It's just their policy. All because of some ridiculous clerical error. [elevator dings] I asked them to bring the car around out front. You should easily make your 3:00 court time. Push my meetings. I should be back by noon tomorrow. I'm sorry this is happening, but I'm sure it's just a minor hiccup. Uh-oh. Edward. Good luck! [serene music] [cell phone ringing] hi, babe. Hello, beautiful! So, sean told me you drove to your hometown. I thought he was kidding. I'm so sorry, edward. I knew you were in a meeting and it happened so quickly. It's, uh, interesting. Yeah? How so? [tender music] [edward] hello? Are you still there? Uh, yeah. Um, I have to go. I'll check in later. [edward] but, wait, wait, wait, why did... [sighs] I can't, no. I'm not gonna- oh! Sorry, that- luke. Hello, abby. How have you been? Fine. When did you move back? A couple years ago. I guess my mom forgot to tell me. Yeah. This is weird, huh? After all these years. Pretty weird. Guess we should get in there and get this over with. Guess so. Mrs. Walker, any idea when mr. Walker will be joining us? I have no idea, your honor. I thought he was right behind me and it's ms. Foster, if you don't mind. Whatever you wish. It looks like the other party's waiving his right to speak on the matter. It's ok. I can just fill him in later. In the interest of time, is there something I need to sign? Or... I'm sorry I'm late, your honor. [whispers] you look very nice, incidentally. Thank you. [clears throat] am I interrupting you two? Because if you'd like to carry on this conversation you can do so outside and we can reschedule. No, your honor, we're ready to proceed. Mr. Walker? I'm ready as well, your honor. Fine. Now, the reason you're both here is because your attorney, the late george bingham, neglected to file your divorce decree with the court. Very late. [playful music] I'm sure this happens all the time, right, your honor? I don't think his honor likes to be interrupted. Right, harlan? Luke. I mean, judge perkins. I apologize for the interruption, your honor. [cell phone chimes] I can check that later. I'll cut to the chase. You two are still married. We're what?! Honey, I'm home. [small laugh] I have a full docket so I'd like to get this matter resolved quickly. Yes! Your honor, we would too, just show me where to sign. All I need is for you both to sign and initial this dissolution document and you will be officially divorced. Bring her here. Let's get it done. And... All signed. Hm. -Here you go. -Thank you. -Oh, you're gonna need this. -Yeah. Thanks. [sighs] [blows raspberry] well? Oh... Are you kidding me? -Mr. Walker. -Yes? Something on your mind? Uh... Sign! I have meetings. I'm sorry, your honor, I just, I guess I just haven't fully digested all of this. It's not chicken salad. There's nothing to digest. Just sign so we can get out of here. Uh... -Luke! -Yes. Ms. Foster... I'm sorry, your honor, I just... I need to get going. I'm about to move to paris to start a new job and I'm getting married in a month.... Remarried. So, as you can imagine, this whole situation is a little inconvenient, to say the least. -Mr. Walker. -Yeah. It's clear where ms. Foster stands. She's already signed the document. It's your move. And she's probably right, your honor. It's just, uh... I just need a moment. Ugh! Marcy, what's my next available slot? Monday morning at 10:00, your honor. See you both then. [gavel bangs] call up the next case. -No! Objection, your honor. -Overruled. No, I just... I need this taken care of today. Now. Sorry, ms. Foster. I can't force him to sign. I suggest the two of you talk it over. Let's try to resolve this quickly for ms. Foster's sake. See you back here Monday. [gavel bangs] that's yours. Excuse me, pardon me. Hey, luke! Luke! Luke! Luke, what was that? This could all be over but because of you I have to wait till Monday! Well, it's obvious, abby, you're in a hurry. I just guess I'm not. Luke, we settled this years ago. Why can't you just sign this stupid paper and give me back my life? I'm getting married in days. Um, correction, abby. You're getting remarried. Ugh! I can't believe you. I guess you'll just have to wait till Monday to get your life back. Luke, this ended the morning you left me. Yeah, about that. About that what? No, nothing. Forget it. What? Nothing. Nothing. I don't understand why you're being so vindictive. What did I ever do to you? Nothing. You've never done anything to me, abby. Trust me, ok? But right now, I'd just like a little time to reflect. Reflect on what? [gentle music] I'm sorry this is happening to you, abby. I am. You know what? You don't know everything. What don't I know? [truck starts] luke! [exhales] it's nice talking to you too, francois. Avec tes... Toi too! And again, my apologies for calling so late. I'm still getting used to the time thing. Uh-huh. Au revoir! Aw. I can't wait to tell the book club girls I actually spoke french with a real french wedding coordinator. Bookies are gonna be so jealous. Um, why is it again you needed to call abby's wedding coordinator? I told you. I just want him to know that I'm here if he needs any help. Or advice. Apparently, he's planned over 200 weddings. I think he's got it. Mmmhmm. Oh, is that the door? [gasps] abigail! Oh, my goodness. [laughter] oh! Well hello there, stranger. Hi, leo. What a lovely surprise. Oh, there's a surprise alright. You're not gonna believe this one. I just found out luke and I are still... Married?! Mmmhmm. To abby foster? No, to taylor swift, robin. Of course it's abby foster. Who else am I supposed to still be married to? How did this happen? Remember george bingham, our attorney? Yeah, he didn't file the paperwork. Apparently they found it squirreled around in some corner in his office. Enjoy. Well, I'm not surprised, half the time he'd forgot to pay his tab. Hey everybody, guess what! My brother here, still married to abby foster. [applause] oh, yeah. Thank you. Oh, you're so kind, aren't you? Well, you know, they would have found out eventually. -Right. -You know this town. -Hey, you know what? -What? I bet you it wasn't an accident. What wasn't an accident, robin? George failing to file the papers. I bet you he thought it was just a passing thing between the two of you and that you should... Just, you know, wait it out. Why would he think that? Well, because the whole town thought that, luke. We all thought you two should be together. Who's abby foster, uncle luke? She's someone you don't know, honey. No, she is your former/current aunt abby. Oh yay, so when can I meet my former/current aunt abby, uncle luke? Well, she's not gonna be here for very long, unfortunately. She's getting married. Remarried. But... Weird. Yeah, my consensus exactly. Listen, it's a technical thing and a little paperwork error. We'll figure it out, we'll get it taken care of. Ah, ahem! No, no, no. No, no, no. Please. In honor of my brother's sort of old, sort of new marriage, pie is on the house. [applause] thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. [exhales] [tentative music] well, say something. Well, I thought I... I thought I, I mean, wasn't this taken care of years ago? Luke was supposed to... He... Supposed to what, mom? You know, stay in your past. Well he didn't. Oh, what a day. Well don't stress yourself. We'll talk to luke. Mm! No. No, I don't want anyone talking to luke. I can handle this myself. Or, leo can call judge perkins. They're on the same bowling league team. No we're not on the same team. I bowl for bowl cut, he bowls for spare me. We're bitter rivals. Well, we'll figure out something. This is just a minor inconvenience. We're all gonna be laughing at this crazy situation next month, in paris, at your wedding reception. This is more than a minor inconvenience, mom. I'm married to one man and engaged to another. That qualifies as a major inconvenience. It's probably a punishable offense in several states. Have you told edward yet? No! No, there's no reason to tell edward. This is all gonna be over soon. This is just a tiny setback trying to spoil our joy, well we won't let it! All the wedding planning is done. Everything's on schedule. This is just the universe telling abigail to take a deep breath and slow down. Right, leo? Right. We should all slow down, shall we dear? I'm not not telling my fiancé I'm married, mom. We tell each other everything. Almost everything. [cell phone chimes] it's him. [exhales] where are you going? I'm gonna get changed and go for a walk. I need to think this through before I call him back. You look like you're gonna faint. Oh, it's nothing, I just... What is it? Oh, I just... I need to get some air. [upbeat music] hello, old friend. [carousel music] [children laughing] ♪ -a lot of memories here. -[gasps] [exhales] you startled me. I'm sorry. Why are you doing this, luke? I know you think I'm trying to be difficult, abby, but that's not it. Then what is it? Something just... I don't know. Something just didn't feel right in the court today. Look, I know this is all out of nowhere, but it's just a clerical error. It's not some big sign from the universe. You sure about that? Look, leo bowls with the judge. If you'll agree to sign the paper, we can finish it this weekend. We don't need to wait until Monday. Actually, abby, they're on rival bowling teams so matter of fact, they're bitter rivals. Look, abby, I'm sorry, ok? I'm sorry about all of this but Monday's only four days away. It's not a big deal, is it? Normally no, but I'm moving to paris. I'm getting married. I don't have the luxury of time. Well, you used to be able to roll with things a whole lot better in the old days, huh? -Yeah, well I grew up. -Mm. I roll differently now. I don't like wasting time. Wasting time or spending time with me? We never planned to spend time together ever again. Actually, wasn't that your plan? [exhales] what did you mean earlier about me not knowing everything? I meant that not everything is exactly as it seems, abby. Oh, please, luke. Stop talking in riddles! [cell phone chimes] it's my fiancé, again. Now I have to go try to explain all of this to him. You know we had our first kiss here? Remember? Right there. Of course I remember. A girl never forgets her first kiss. [knocking on carousel] I asked you to marry me right here. [sighs] and I said yes. And here we are, 20 years later. Practically strangers, and still married. What do you know? We said we'd always be honest, so I had to tell you. I'm so sorry I waited this long. You left out a whole marriage. I know... It lasted for less than a month when I was 18. Uh-huh, but you could have told me. I mean, I don't know, uh, "guess what babe, you will not be my first husband." I know, edward. I guess I was just embarrassed. I never even think about him anymore. Now until today, anyway. So he was in court? Your husband. You see, that sounds strange. Yes, he was there. And he wouldn't sign? No, that's the frustrating part. This could all be over if he would have just... [exhales] the judge wanted everyone to be sure, so here I am. And he's not sure? But you're sure. Of course I'm sure! Of course. He's just being difficult. Well, don't worry about it. I know everything's gonna work out. And I miss you. I miss you too. Thank you for being so understanding. I'm driving home in the morning, I'll come back Monday for court. No. What? It's too much driving, babe. Plus, I know how stressed you get out on the highway. And you're going through a lot since you landed the paris job. And your mom too. Maybe if you spend some days with her it'll help calm her down. [edward] just take some time to breathe. I guess I could use a few days of downtime to recharge for the big move. But I don't want to- right, well that's why you should stay there. Spend some time with your folks. I mean, you never know when you're gonna be back in your hometown again. That's why I love you. Yeah. I love you too. Good night. Ok, I'll talk to you tomorrow, ok? There you go, honey. -Oh, thank you. -Yeah. You know what mom, I am marrying the most understanding man on the face of the earth. Aw. Well, that's a wonderful trait. I think it's one of the most important qualities one can have in a partner. So we're all set then? Don't worry. Luke will come to his senses. Mom, you make me nervous when you talk about how reasonable luke is. [exhales] all's gonna be well. Did you make this? No, when would I have had time? I got it at robin's restaurant. She's my pretend pastry chef. Apparently she's still my real sister-in-law. Yeah. [upbeat music] there you go, contract signed. Thank you very much, you two. Now, onto more pressing business. You guys both told me you both love oyster white, right? -We still do. -Yeah. It's a warm color. It says friendly people live here. Right. Doesn't it? But we're not going with that color. We've decided to rethink things. Ok, alright. So any ideas? We're going to just wait for a color to appear. Appear? Yeah. Ok. We've been streaming open your thoughts. Are you familiar with the program? No, I don't think so. It'll transform your life. Ok. Yeah. I hope so, I could use it. But, in the meantime, once that color appears, let me know. -Ok. -Sure. -Sounds good. -Thanks for coming in. Thanks, ruthie. I'll get this. [blows raspberry] it's just a few... Luke! I need you. Soap monster's gone haywire again. Ok, I'm coming. Excuse me, you two, my services are required. -Sure. -Of course. I'll get this, like I said. -Thank you. -Great, thanks. Luke, you're just making it worse. Robin, come on. I'm just trying to diagnose the issue here. Mom? We're backing up out here. Ok, well can you diagnose a little bit faster? We're running out of clean dishes. Ok. I'm on it. Abby. Hey, robin. Hi. Oh, it's so good to see you. It's nice to see you too. I just met ruthie. She looks exactly like you did in high school. I thought it was you for a second. Well you look amazing. Oh, well, thank you, you're very kind. -You do too. -Aw, thank you. Oh hey, luke is in the kitchen. I gotta run, but it's really good to see you. Nice to see you too. Oh, dear. You've made quite the mess back there. [chuckles] well I didn't make it. But I'm gonna fix it. Hm. You sure about that? Well, I'm gonna try. Want me to take a look? Ok, be my guest. Out of my way. Oh, it's time to get serious, is it? You sure it's not in there? It's not in there. It's your float. The switch is stuck and when that happens, the relay switch won't activate and this happens. There you go. [laughs] ok! Ooh. Well, I almost fixed it. [laughing] you're just mad because I showed you up, mr. Not-so-fixit. [laughing] so where'd you learn to be so handy anyway? Oh, well, leo. I moved home after... Anyway, leo was a mechanic and he taught me everything I know about machines. Which is a lot. Well, you certainly look good in soap. Oh, well you're quite the sud yourself. Did I just say that? Yeah, you kind of did. [luke laughs] I could never "pun" very well. It's ok. [cell phone ringing] that could be my office. Oh, it's edward. Hey, babe. No, I'm not busy. [sighs] edward. [peaceful music] [festive music] [kids cheering and laughing] -hey! -Hey! It's good to see you here. I couldn't miss the end of summer festival while I'm here. It was my absolute favorite thing when I was growing up. Pie? [exhales] yes. I never say no to pie. Mmmm. -That looks good. -Here you go. Oh, this is beautiful pie. It's good. -Mmhm. -Mm. So, it's a crazy situation between you and luke, huh? Crazy is an understatement. Well, I guess that makes us sisters-in-law again. [laughs] yeah, for a few days, anyway. Is this ruthie's status update, is that- yeah, my daughter is all about her music. Such a fun age. But, uh right now she is over volunteering at luke's booth. Luke has a booth? Mmhm, yeah. It's just out past the wonders of cheese booth on the left. Can't miss it. No, no, no, that's ok. I wasn't... Oh. Except, I was just... Mm! How're you doing, phoebe? Oh, wow. That looks so good. Beautiful. [luke] nice job. How's it going, travis? Let's see here, buddy. Wow! You see, now that's amazing. I actually feel a whole lot better just seeing trees in the background there. Hey! Just walking by. Luke, I had no idea your paintings were so beautiful. Well, you know I had a lot of... Lot of free time in alaska, so... You want to help? -With? -Yeah. Sure. Come on! Everybody, this is abby. Can you guys say hi? [children] hi abby. Hi, everybody. [chuckles] oh, see cecilia, that's so much better. These strokes, here. That's really cool. Is that a cat? That's a good-looking cat. Looks almost like he has wings coming up from the side. It's like a dragon cat. I like it. [upbeat music] this is a lot of fun. It's just like I remember. Ruthie! I hear your band is playing at the dance. We can't wait. Are you coming? I wouldn't miss it. [girls giggling] ruthie! We were looking all over for you. Tyler and the guys are having a party. You have to come! Hello claire, hello ashley. Girls. Remember, I told you? Oh, yeah. Hey. Home by 10:00pm. [delighted squealing] [laughs] oh! Well I am spent. There's a bubble bath and a glass of wine calling my name. Well-deserved. -Enjoy. -Bye. See ya. So... You uh, you have any, any plans tonight? Uh, leo's going out so I promised mom I'd have dinner with her. Ah. Right. Of course. Well, I should probably close up the booth. Have a nice evening. Thanks. Oops! Sorry, bud. [chopping sounds] -you ok? -Yeah, sure. Why? I don't know. You're going at those vegetables awful aggressively. That's all. I guess this whole marriage business has me a little tense. -I'm off! -Oh. Whatever you do, do not lose to that judge. Don't worry. It's in the bowling bag. Oh, whatever. [giggling] -kisses! -Goodbye. Muah. Have fun. -Love you guys. -Love you. Love you too. Why don't you go for a walk? Go into to town, get a drink, even. A bite to eat. I don't mind. This was supposed to be our mother-daughter time. Yeah, I know. But we'll have that time in paris. We'll go shopping. Guess a walk could do me some good. Yeah. Ok. What time do you think you'll be home? I don't know mom, I no longer have a curfew. Mmm. [peaceful music] [jazz music] you too! Oh, hi ian. How've you been? My evening is now complete. My best waitress has returned to join my worst dishwasher. Oh. Oh, no, no, no. I'm not... He refused to order anything until you arrived. Not even water. The best table in the place. But of course, you remember. I guess I can stay a minute. [laughing] luke and abigail. I can't believe you are here in my restaurant again. Let me make something special for you, please. Thank you. That would be wonderful, ian. Thank you. -Hi. -Hello. [awkward chuckle] so I guess we had the same idea, huh? Yeah, I just wanted to see if it was still here. Oh, no it's, it's still here. And open. Gonna be honest, this is the first time I've set foot in here since I got back from alaska, so... Until tonight. Yeah, until tonight. It feels really strange to be sitting here. I mean, I wonder how many times I waited on this table. While I was in the kitchen, laboring away, cleaning dishes. Please. [laughs] what? You did seem to work the same shift a lot. Yeah. I have to confess something. It wasn't just a coincidence. You see ian over there's a romantic at heart. Oh. Hm. So now I know. Well, you know. Hey, it worked, right? I remember being here one time until after 2:00am in the morning, polishing silverware after one of your big ideas gone wrong. Yeah, you're talking about the time when I thought it was a great idea to soak silverware in bleach and sparkling clean. But instead- it turned everything jet black. [laughing] -aye. -[abby exhales] but that was the moment that I knew. Knew what? You were the one. [romantic music] why? Because I helped you out of a mess? No, abby. Because you helped me out of a mess because you cared about me. Your favorite. [waiter] oh, no! Ah! Crisis! Wow. Well, at least they didn't bring out two. I'll let you be the judge. What's he like, abby? The guy you're marrying. -Edward. -Hm. He's good and kind. He's so smart. He's just a really solid guy. And he loves me. We're good together. So were we. Don't do this, luke. And that would be... Get your hopes up that we're gonna be anything more than friends. Bite? This thing's huge. Ok, um... [peaceful music] that was the best caramel cookie crunch I have ever had. [laughing] I know, it was amazing. Ian is some kind of genius. Mm. It was so good. Hey, do you remember when we used to sneak a scoop when ian turned his back, remember? -Sneak! -Yeah. -He knew. -You think? Those scoops were instead of an end of summer bonus. Oh, well. You might be right. -Oh. -Wow. Remember in high school when we'd meet here at night? Mmm. Start it up when no one was around. I do remember that, yeah. [both laugh] we never got caught either, did we? No. What? Are you serious? Come on, after all the ice cream we just had, you want...? Ok, you're on. One ride. -Yes! -Let's go. Alright. [carousel music] ok. You good? -Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry! -Alright. [abby laughs] here we go. I can't believe I let you talk me into this. I think you're the one who did all the talking. [luke laughs] bring back good memories? I didn't think I'd miss home as much as I do. [sentimental music] [both laugh] -you alright? -Yeah, it was fun. Here, let me, let me help you. Yeah. [sentimental music] we should go. We don't want to get caught. Well, I'm not hurting anything. I think it's best we leave. Ok, I mean, ok. I'll walk you home. It's, uh, it's ok. I know the way. Right. [laughs] luke, what did you expect from all this? I have no idea. Are you sure? Are you sure about edward? Yeah, I'm sure. -Good night. -Yeah, good night. Abby, it's late. Where have you been? Mom, please. I'm not 17 anymore. Well, I know you're not 17 anymore, but you are still engaged. You don't need to remind me of that. Well... I was just out with luke. Mom, come on. I'm so tired. Can we please do whatever this is in the morning? No. We can't. [sighs] ok, then what do you want to say to me? Why are you acting so strangely? Have you ever kept a secret for so long that it just starts to eat away at your conscience? Just say what you want to say you're a beautiful woman... Mom! [teary] I'm the reason that luke left you. When the acceptance letter came from princeton, I went to him and I told him that if he didn't leave you that he would ruin your life. Blow your big chance. [breathing shakily] abigail! Where are you going? I can't believe you kept this from me. This is big, mom. Huge! You told luke to leave me. How am I supposed to wrap my head around that? Luke made that decision on his own, I just nudged him in that direction. Abby, he was thinking of you. He did it for you. Listen, when that acceptance letter came from princeton, I got to the mailbox first. And I opened it and I read it and I was just so proud of you, and then I just sealed it up and put it back so that you wouldn't know. I know it was wrong. Did leo know about this all this time? No. No. I just told him and he's as shocked as you are. No wonder luke hasn't signed the decree. He's still dealing with what happened. How could you keep this from me all these years? I didn't think you'd ever forgive me, abby. But you have to know, that I did it for you. I thought it was what was best for both of you. That wasn't your decision to make! Well, I know that now. But everything worked out for you, didn't it? I mean, you have a job you love, a wonderful man you're about to marry. Paris. The ends justify the means. [sighs] I need time to process this. Please give me that. Where are you going? To see my husband. When did you get into stargazing? Oh, I'd say, when I was in alaska. They've got some pretty incredible night skies there that the shooting stars are like fireworks. I do my best thinking under the stars, so... Luke, mom told me everything. About how she convinced you to give up our marriage so I could go to princeton. And how you've been carrying this secret all those years. So you finally know. What I don't know is why. Why didn't you even talk to me about it? Maybe we could have had it all. Maybe it could have been you and me heading to paris. But it's not, is it, abby? It's not. And it's too late. Let's just face this for a second. If I'd have come to you and told you exactly what your mother told me back then, you'd have taken that princeton letter, you'd have ripped it in half because you would have chosen us and I couldn't allow you to throw your future away on me. Because you weren't worth it? No. I mean, I was different back then, sure. I mean I didn't have as much, I didn't have any self-confidence, really. And now? Abby, you got the life you wanted. And deserved. It's just unfortunate it's not here with me. Is that... Is that how you think love works? That a little challenge arises and you just cut and run? Was it hard leaving me? [tender music] it was the hardest thing I've ever done. I think I've seen enough stars for one night. Luke... What do I do with this knowledge? What now? It's just up to you, abby. I don't know. But I'm so relieved that you finally know the truth. [sighs] did you ever think about me? When you were looking up at the skies, did you think about us? Uh, every single night. [sighs] [peaceful music] you sure this garden party's the right thing right now? I hurt abby and I want to do something nice for her and it's my week to host the book club and the bookies are happy to help me celebrate abby. I still think it's a bad idea. It's just a book club meeting. That's french-themed with abby as the guest of honor right when she's learning how to deal with this huge secret in her life. Well, I'm the mother of the bride and I have the right to celebrate my soon-to-be wed daughter if I want. And besides, the girls are really looking forward to seeing her before the wedding. You should tell her. Well then it wouldn't be a surprise now, would it? I'm off to the robin's nest. I washed up your old bike if you want to use it. Thanks. Who are you meeting at the restaurant? Luke. -We're renewing our vows. -Uh... I'm joking, mom. I'm going for coffee on my bike, thanks to leo. Well what are your plans for this evening? I thought I would go to the dance at the fairgrounds. Ruthie's band is playing. Oh, well, we were thinking of having dinner all together tonight, early dinner. -Sure. See ya later. -[blows kiss] love, perfectly bad idea. [cheerful music] [peaceful music] edward, I have so much to tell you. We can talk it all out when I get back. [edward] can't wait. Tonight I'm gonna go see ruthie's band play. Will your husband be there? Edward, stop. [edward] yeah, I'm just teasing. So, how's that going anyway? Well, he still hasn't signed yet. I think he's just being stubborn. I'm sure he will on Monday. I need to get coffee. I'll call you later, ok? [edward] yep. Just text me before bedtime. Alright. Will do. -Love you, bye. -Bye. -Morning, abby. -Good morning. -Coffee? -Yes, please. -Oh hey. -Hi. Would you like to sit down? Oh, no, no, I don't want to disturb your work. Oh no, you're not doing anything. No, it's just... This is nothing. I'm actually just waiting for a couple clients is all. Yeah, they're a little high maintenance sell, so I figured I'd caffeine up. Oh, are they as bad as I was when we lived in that apartment over the autobody shop? Oh, close, close. No, didn't you make me repaint the living room like four times or something? Well, I mean... It was hard to get the right tone. Right. Right. I like to just think that you were training me for how to handle my future business. Well then you're welcome. Thank you. Oh, there they are. Oh, I'll move. No, no, it's fine. No need to move, we're not staying. Luke, we just wanted to let you know that while a color did manifest itself- mmhm. We've decided to go in a new direction. Oh, ok. Well, why don't you just tell me the new color and we'll take it- a totally new direction. Dan crocker said he could do the job for 10-percent less than your bid. It's nothing personal, it's only business. Right, no, I understand. Ok, well, thank you for letting me know... No, no. No, no, no. Not happening. And you are? Mr. Walker's attorney. Did you sign a contract with my client? Well, yes, but... And do you have any idea how many jobs my client has turned down because he's contracted to paint your house? Well, no, but... That's ok. I'll let you know when I get you under oath in deposition. -We don't really want that. -No. No, that sounds unpleasant. So, do you have something you'd like to say to my client? Um... You can start on Tuesday. Mmhm. We'll see you then, guys. Thanks. Abby... You didn't have to say that. We always used to stick up for each other, remember? -I do. -And that felt good. I bet it did. They'll be very happy they stuck with you. Mmm. The one thing we now need to sort out is, um, my commission or my attorney's fees. Yeah. I'll have to make a note of it. Mmhm. But the real question here is, how is judge perkins gonna react when he finds out that you're posing as an attorney? Oh, that guy. Yeah. Here you go. On the house in honor of your upcoming marriage. [uneasy music] thanks, robin. I'm gonna head off. I'll walk you out. -Mm. -Yeah. Okey-doke. Thank you. I want to make sure you, make sure you, you know, put on your helmet. -Safety first. -Safety first. Everything seems so much smaller. [chuckles] yeah. I agree. I felt the same way when I returned from alaska. It was like I had a different perspective. It's like time stood still. But it doesn't, does it? It doesn't. You know what I remember most about my life here is... You. [sentimental music] you know, before we were us, we were friends. -We were best friends. -Yeah. And like today, you always stood up for me. Of course. But I do remember running against you for student council president in 6th grade. -Yes. Yep. -[abby laughs] uh-huh. I remember that. But when I had to pick a campaign manager to introduce me and say nice things, mr. Wilkins told me to pick the student I trusted most, it was you. -[abby laughs] -what? I still remember what you said when you introduced me. "I'd trust abby foster with my star wars lunch box. "even if there was a double fudge brownie inside it." yeah, I did say that. I did. Unfortunately, I think that joke fell flat. I don't know, I beat you by five votes. One of those votes was mine. -Really? -Yeah. You're the best friend I ever had. I'm gonna go now. Hm. I have a few things I need to do and I promised mom I'd have an early dinner with them before the dance tonight. Alright. So, um, will you be there later? Wouldn't miss it. Alright. -So... -I am going to go. Ok. I will see you tonight. [bike bell dings] that works. Backing up. -Oh, and abby? -Yeah? Don't forget the helmet. Ah, thank you, captain safety. You are welcome. Abby, your helmet's on backwards. -I don't think so. -You don't think so? Feels right. Looks good either way. Thank you! [bike bell dings] -ding-ding! -Ding-ding! [laughing] [peaceful music] surprise! [laughter] this was so hard to keep secret, right? Hello everyone. Now, come over here. This is the sofa for the bride of honor. You sit right here in the middle. [abby] wow. The bookies wanted to do something special for you before you were whisked off to paris. And as you can see, it is french-themed. Thank you. Oh, and where's leo? Where is that man? Oh, leo! Leo, honey. Did you check on the mini croissants? Oh, I already ate those. Seriously? I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it! Go, go! Go, leo, go! Oh, that man is too much. Now, abby, tell us, were you surprised? Sure was. [applause] oh, we did it! I knew it! Let's see what the girls gave you! Open up. Sure. Um, I can reach this one. Let's see. [bookies oohing] oh, a little wine and cheese in paris. Oui. -Nice, what's in this one? -Let's see. Help. S'il vous plait. Ulgh. Why didn't you warn me? Your mother would have banished me to the couch for a month if I'd uttered a word. They made me an honorary bookie. [snickers] welcome to the club. [abby laughs] [cell phone chimes] ruthie's band is playing at the dance and I need a favor. Cover for ya. Thank you. Thank you. Be good. [hopeful music] -I made it. -Oh. Just in time. -Hey, about time. -Traffic. Poplar traffic? [scoffs] I need to get a better angle. -Yeah. -Ok. Do you think we would have made it? If we stayed together back then? Well, I may be naive, but... I always believed in our forever. It's never too late to believe again. Hi everyone, we are so excited to be playing for you tonight.

I didn't, uh, know you were coming. I wanted to surprise you. Stopped by your house but there's a garden party going on, so... Leo told me you were here. -You must be luke? -Yeah. Edward. Abby's fiancé. Hello. I'm... I'm sorry to interrupt. Oh... No, no. It's fine, edward. Actually I was... I was just leaving. -It's a pleasure to meet you. -Pleasure. You're a very lucky man. Thanks for the dance, abby. Excuse me. -Wow, I met the famous luke. -Yeah. Abby... If you have unfinished business, you should take care of it. I will be right back, I promise. Mmmhmm. Luke, wait! No. Abby look, it's fine. Listen, just, it's fine. Just go back to your fiancé. Look at him, he's waiting for you and to be honest I have nothing left to say. Well I might have something to say to you, did you ever think about that? What's the point, abby? Our time has passed. -Luke... -You know what? You have nothing to worry about 'cause I'll go in there, I'll talk to the judge myself. So you know, give her what she wants. Give her the divorce. 'cause we both know that's exactly what you want, right? Oh, how dare you play the victim! You're the one who left me. I know the reason now, but still. I was 18-years-old and I loved you with all my heart. You left me without any explanation. You have no idea how much that hurt me. No idea. Abby, answer me one question. Do you still have feelings for me? Yes or no? Simple answer. [scoffs] it's ok. You've already chosen. See you in court on Monday, abby. I guess we need to talk. Yeah. [peaceful music] I bet you wish I hadn't come, don't ya? No. No, edward. I, uh, I think all this was just a little unexpected. Well, I missed you. Edward... Just, let me. Please. Abby, I... I loved you since I first met you. And that love has um, only grown the more I knew you. You're this amazing, smart, funny, incredible woman. You are the woman I want to marry and spend my life with. But none of that matters if I don't have 100 percent of you. Ninety-nine won't do. I deserve all of you. Your whole heart. -You're such a good man. -I know. [laughs] but you're right. You deserve so much more than I can give you. I'm so sorry. I'll miss you, abby. Abby is never going to forgive me for what I did. You know that isn't true. Then why did she just leave a party I held for her in her honor? This isn't about you. Well, it serves me right for interfering all those years ago and assuming I knew best. I think that we all need to learn to stay out of the way and let love run its course. Well, do you forgive me? For keeping it from you all these years. The thing is, anger fades fast but love stays forever. Thank you, honey. Thank you. Oh. I'm sorry I ran out on you. Oh, um, I'm just gonna head outside and check to see if I left anything on the table. Ok? We all make mistakes and when we do, forgiveness is what keeps family, family, ok? Abigail, I never should have surprised you with that silly party. No, mom, it was sweet of you and I'm sorry I ran out on the bookies. Well, the croissants were delicious. They were very flaky, it was really... Mom. Edward and I broke up. Oh. Luke and I were happy, mom. I know we were young but we loved each other so much. We had plans. I thought luke didn't love me. I thought he didn't want me. Do you have any idea what that does to a person? Do you have any idea what it did to me? I don't know what to say. I have been keeping this secret for 20 years. And I tried to justify it. I tried to convince myself that what I was doing was best for you. But I never really believed it. Can you ever forgive me, abby? I forgive you. What's done is done, and I know you had your heart set on paris and the wedding and all of that... What I have my heart set on is my daughter being happy. Because you are my everything and I would never want you to marry someone that you didn't love. So, luke. You still love him, don't you? I think I'll always love luke. But tonight he made it pretty clear that things between us are done for good. I guess we can't go back in time, but we'll always have our memories. What's next? I go to court on Monday, finalize the divorce then I'll go home and finish getting ready for France. Everything's the same, just no wedding, no edward. I'm exhausted. I'm gonna go to bed. Good night, sweetheart. Good night. Ok, leo, you can come out now. Ahhhh... [chuckles] -good night, kiddo. -Good night. So, you heard. Abby and edward... I did. Are you ok? I'm gonna be. You know, abby will need some help unpacking and getting settled. And I've always wanted to see the eiffel tower. -Je t'aime. -Right back at ya. You're my girl. [sentimental music] [sentimental music] -I love you, abby. -I love you too. There you go. It's beautiful. It's my new favorite. Yeah. I think it turned out just right. Hey, aren't you supposed to be in court? Oh no, no. That's over. I swung by the judge's office this morning and signed the papers. We are officially divorced. You ok? Yeah, I'm fine, robin. Why? Come on, she's getting married anyway. It's not a big deal. I mean, look. No point in hanging onto something that's never gonna be. Right? What? Emily. May I have a moment? Please. Yeah. Yeah. I, uh, came here to apologize. It's... It's an apology 20 years in the making and what I did... Convincing you to leave abby and to give away your marriage, it was simply wrong. I had no right to interfere and, and I hurt two wonderful people because I was selfish and because I believed that I alone knew what was best. Well, I... I didn't know. Why are you here, emily? Huh? Why now? I mean come on, it seems like you got everything you ever wanted, right? I mean, your daughter's marrying the better man, moving to paris... Sounds like you got your dream. Luke, the thing is my dream doesn't matter. Abby's dream is all that counts. And that dream includes you. Emily, your daughter's marrying edward. Obviously you have not heard. The wedding is off. And abby is at the courthouse, right now expecting to see you. Thank you. [upbeat music] [abby] breathe, breathe. You're fine. Maybe they're delayed. Probably not. Oh, ok. Here we go. I'm gonna take her spot... You got it! Oh, here we go. Perfect. Be right back! Oh dear. Good morning, looks like everyone's present so let's get started. -Excuse me, your honor. -Ms. Foster? I'm here for the hearing, marriage of walker? I guess you didn't get the message. That matter is closed. Mr. Walker signed the divorce decree this morning. Oh, um, we were supposed to talk first, have a hearing. I want to be heard, your honor. Ms. Foster, there's no longer a need for you to be heard. You got what you asked for. You signed the document, he signed the document. You're divorced. Divorced? Mmhm. For real? Hold on, this is what you said you wanted and now it's done. Now, if you don't mind, ms. Foster, I have a very busy schedule. Sorry, your honor. Sorry I'm late. Luke, what's going on? I... I changed my mind, your honor. I'd like to take my... My signature back. -Hi. -Hi. Luke, there are no take-backs. Your divorce is final, so if you both will please vacate the courtroom. It's ok, it's not gonna take more than a minute, you guys are ok, right? Everything's... Love your suit, by the way. You do realize this is a court of law, don't you? You don't make the rules here, I do. I understand, your honor, it is. I just, it'll just take us a minute. That's all. Fine. You each have 30 seconds to say your piece. Who'd like to go first? I will, if the court doesn't mind. No, the court can't wait. Go ahead. Remind me to retire. I know the last time we met it seemed like my mind was pretty made up when I said I wanted to end my marriage to mr. Walker. But, uh, but things changed. Over the last few days I realized that what I thought was true about mr. Walker, about... About luke, isn't in fact true at all. I found out that the real reason he left me is because he loved me. So, I would just like to say... Time's up. You, you have 30 seconds. Well I'm not gonna need that much time, your honor. Do you love me? For real? -I do. -Good. Because I love you too. Always have, always will. [applause] [romantic music] [laughter] [french-style music] if we make those changes we should be good to go. Thank you very much. Merci beaucoup. Je te vois dans la matinée. Au revoir. -Hello. -Hey. -Champagne? -Uh-huh. What is the occasion? Well... [cork pops] -oh! -I uh... [both laughing] I sold another painting today. Sweetie! That's wonderful. I'm so proud of you. Thank you. So, I was thinking a toast. Yes. To our past and to our future. Absolutely. Luke. Abby, marry me. Again. Oui! Oui! Yes, yes, yes, absolument yes. Please, do the honors. Of course. I'll love you forever. And forever more. Extracted from video file by R.O.D.
