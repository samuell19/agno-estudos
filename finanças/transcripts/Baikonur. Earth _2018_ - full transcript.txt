While ten years ago, it was making 300 cubic metres of foam, now its output rose to 1,500. The management also cares for workers' education. Alexander Аbritsov joined as a simple worker, now he is a product engineer. They have created favourable conditions with a view to giving us opportunities to study. The aim is to send us to other factories for further training. We can get not only knowledge… But a huge experience, too. The factory supplies goods not only to Kazakhstan, but the entire Central Asian market. [CLAPPING FROM TV] So we are real fellow countrymen of the first Kazakh poet-bard.

[ANIMAL SOUNDS] [BIRDS CHIRPING] [BIRDS CONTINUE CHIRPING] This whole land was once under the sea. [BIRDS CONTINUE CHIRPING] The Aral Sea used to be one of the four biggest lakes in the world. In the 60s the water of two rivers that feed into the Aral Sea was used for the irrigation of cotton fields. So, starting from the mid-70s, the Aral Sea started to shrink and at the beginning of the 90s it was divided into two parts. The North Aral Sea, which is on the Kazakh side, and the South Aral Sea. The shoreline started to shrink and for example before 2005, before building the Kokaral dam, we used to drive about 60 km to get to the nearest point of the water. And nowadays, after building the dam, the North Aral Sea has started to revive and the nearest point is about 25 km from town. Now with the dam, we have more than 50 types of freshwater fish species in the Aral Sea. So the life is back.
