Mom, did I wake you? She left already. I got it, mom. Are you excited for Friday? Can't wait. What, are you afraid of your Chinese parents meeting the new black in-laws? I'm sure it'll be fine. Yeah, that's what you said about Candace. They love Candace now. That's 'cause she's half, bro. They like the white part. Go fuck yourself. Come on, let's go, let's go, let's go. He's playing games right now. He's playing games. Yo. Hey. I'm not done with my slice. Come on, you lazy fuck. Hey! Aren't y'all supposed to be in school? There's no school right now. Yeah? How come you're wearing those book bags? We had school, now there isn't any. Yeah, well those bags look pretty heavy. What you guys got in them? Books. Books? Books? Hey, you want to show me? Man, I ain't got to show you shit. Ah fuck. Don't fucking move. Stop! Hey, stop! Hey, stop! Are you fucking kidding me? Mike! Mike! Stop! Watch out! Fuck! You okay? You okay? I'm okay. Fuck, he's heading back downstairs! Ma'am! Fuck. Ma'am, open up. Please, help me, my son, he's been shot. He's been shot, I don't know what happened. Stay with us. Stay with me. How did this happen? Stay with me, come on, breathe. Breathe, Jordan. Why aren't you doing something? Where's the ambulance? Get the fuck over here. How did this happen? How did this happen? We need a bus, 2323 Grandview Avenue, shots fired, man down. Breathe. Responding, what's your call sign? Nine Charlie, can we get a confirmation on that bus? What the fuck? What happened? Give me the fucking phone. What the fuck? Give me the phone. You shot him! Do something All right Officer Tan, I think that's about it. Make sure you're here tomorrow night to meet with your rep. Go get changed and clean yourself up. Ma. I'm sorry. Give me that. I got it. I couldn't get away. You okay? I'm fine. Not enough time to eat. Pepto is on the table. Okay. How are you feeling? Okay. I have a meeting with my union rep tonight. Do you want me to talk to my dad? No, I'll do that. I'm sure I'll see him at the precinct. What are you doing today? I have a home visit for a kid in Bay Ridge, and other than that just the usual. You want some company on the train? Do you just want me to take the day off? I can switch with Kelly. No don't do that. I'll just text you after the meeting. You sure? Yeah. Alright. When are you gonna talk to your parents? I don't know. Mike, just tell them what happened. I'll figure it out. Mike. Chief. How are you holding up? I'm okay. Coming in to see your union rep? Yeah. Who is it? Ritchie Barrett? Yeah. He's got a good reputation. I'm sure he'll take care of you. Tell Candace and your parents I'll be there Friday night. It's okay. Hey, I just checked. Schedule's wide open. Okay. Great. Hang in there, kid. You two really fucked up. You're in a heap of shit you realize that? Lucky for you this one is pretty clear cut. Hard to prove intent when you shoot someone through a wall. Now, the department is going to conduct an official review, IAB will be poking around, so get your story straight and consistent, they're even gonna look at all your old cases. Now you're off the street for the next couple of weeks, paid leave, I don't wanna hear a peep from you, so don't let me catch you talking to the press. This is a PR nightmare for the department. Here's my card, call me 24/7 if you need me, leave your gun with Jackson down the hall, and don't worry, you'll be back on the street before you know it. She never paid? She doesn't pay, we won't do it again next year. Ma. Ma. Nevermind. Eat. I shot someone. What? Are they okay? He died. It was an accident. Not the kid we heard about on the news right? What did your parents say? My mom was trying to make me feel better. I think my dad was worried and just didn't want to show it. Hmm. Well, how are you doing? I'm good. I'm fine. Okay. Hey, Candace? Yeah? What are you doing right now? Well God we thank you for today, and we thank you for the life of Jordan Wiggins. His light will surely be missed. And God bless all of our sons tonight, because we know that these are difficult and trying times, but God we believe in the power of your healing and restoration. We believe in your light and your mercy, oh God. We ask that you allow your grace and your mercy to rein in this moment. On this plane or in the next keep us safe, and may you forever stand beside us. Amen. Amen. Hi, I'm Felicia Wiggins. Jordan was my son. He was a good son. He worked when he was supposed to, he came home to me when he was supposed to. Jordan was an artist. I see that a lot of you put up some of his work. Thank you for that. He would've like that, thank you. Thank you, Felicia. Why are we here today? Jordan was a good kid. Jordan was not a criminal. Jordan did not have a gun. So why are we here? Are you gonna be alright? I just wish they knew what happened. I mean, they know what happened. I mean like, how it happened. But that doesn't change anything does it? You think I did this on purpose? That's not what I said. It's just, I mean the guy's dead, and, I wasn't just gunning down black people in the street, what the fuck do you think I am? That's not what I'm saying. You think I went to work the other morning looking for some black guy to shoot? I didn't do that. Mike. Shhh. Look I'm not one of those fucking racist assholes. You think I wanted to kill him? That's not what I said. Look, you don't know what it's like to grow up in a world where talking to a cop could get you killed just because of the color of your skin. It's just not something that happens to someone like you. What and that happens to you? You're the daughter of a cop. You're right, I don't know their lives, but my mom walked out on us because she couldn't deal with the color of my skin. My dad gets dragged up on that podium to be a black face for the department every single time a black man is shot in Brooklyn. So no, I don't have the problems they have, but I have been dealing with this bullshit my entire life. I love you. I believe you. I know you're not that, but you can't expect them to know you like I do. Hey man. Hey. How's it going? It's going all right. Good as it can I guess. Have you heard what they're saying about us? You cannot listen to that stuff, the press is looking for headlines. There you go. Thanks, man. That kid was the same age as us. There's an expression in Chinese, "the gray haired burying the black haired." I can't imagine my mom burying me. It's too real. I killed him. Hey, hey! Seriously, don't say that. I know that you feel guilty about this, but you can't be going round the world saying that you killed somebody, okay? My dad was telling me this story, about this guy in the 70s that he knew, killed this little white girl in the upper east side, by accident. After the press took to him, it wasn't long before he was kicked off the force, indicted, went to jail and his family disowned him. They found him a year later in a shitty Bronx apartment hanging from the top hook of his fucking closet. This can go downhill fast, and if you're not careful, we'll both go down with it. You shot him, it was an accident. Remember that. I mean it was a horrible thing that happened, but you're not to blame here. You were doing your job. Shit. No justice, no peace, no justice, no peace, no justice, no peace. Justice for Jordan. Say his name. Mike. Hi. Now what's going on, I'm a little busy. You've seen the video right? Uh-huh. I've been hearing people say- - Oh, don't listen to what people are saying. A grand jury is a standard procedure with something like this. Grand jury? It's a show! No cop's been indicted for twelve years. When is this? In a few days. Now don't worry, go home, keep your head down. Do I need to testify? I can testify. Oh, I don't think that's a good idea. They'll rip you apart. Everything you say is on record, you change any part of your story it'll come back and bite you in the ass. But if I tell the truth my story won't change. You're not getting it. It's not about the truth, it's about making you look bad. Officer Tan, what were you doing in the moments leading up to the discharge of your firearm? I was in pursuit of a suspect. Ryan and I- - Officer Doheney. Officer Doheney and I were following a suspect through the hall when he turned the corner. Which corner? Which one? The one at the end of the hall? Which end east or west? It was, I think it was the west end of the hall. You think? Well which end was it Officer Tan? It was the west end of the hall. And then what? The suspect turned the corner, and I pulled out my firearm. Now was that before or after you turned the corner? Before. So you can definitively say that you pulled your firearm before you turned the corner. It was before. And when did you call for the suspect to stop? Ryan was the one that called- - Officer Doheney! Officer Doheney called out for the suspect after he turned the corner. So you pulled your firearm before calling for the suspect to stop? No, I don't think so. So you have no idea which side of the hallway you were on, when you pulled your firearm, or when you called for the suspect to stop? Go home, Mike. Don't worry about it. Keep your head down. We got your back. Justice for Jordan! Protect and Serve! No Justice. No Peace. Hey! Yeah, I see you! Camera shy now? You can't just walk away. To protect and to serve, right? You need to pay for what you did to him! Oh, okay. Where did you learn to do all this? A woman has to know every piece of housework even if she doesn't do it everyday. It's my mom's famous saying. Men in this family are useless. I'm sure it's not that bad. I don't think my brother knows how to do his own laundry. I think you're needed in the kitchen. Come sit. Your father's beating me at this game. My boss gave me the name of a guy who's one of the top criminal defense lawyers. What? I don't need a lawyer. You have to take control of these things. It's important. You can't just hope that this goes away. I just went to see my union rep a couple days ago, I'm handling it. Do you know how much stress this is putting on mom and dad? I get it. Well, then do something about it. This is a feast. It's all her. Eat, eat, you guys start. Let me get you a fork. No, no, no need, I prefer chopsticks. You sure? I'll get you one. I need to make sure to turn off the stove. Ma, ma, ma, it's off, sit down. Our son is still young, and he has a lot to learn from you, sir. And we are really happy to meet you. Candace, we spoiled Mike, and you have a lot of immaturity to deal with. I wish you luck. Dad? Huh? To Mike and Candace. Yes, cheers! Cheers! Eat, eat. Eat when it's hot. My favorite. Do you want to try some tofu? Oh yes, please. Thank you. Sorry, I have to take this. Let's eat. Hello? Hey, Mike. Ritchie Barrett. How you doing? I'm good. What's up? I'm sorry, Mike, the grand jury came back this afternoon, you've been indicted. What? Don't worry, we can meet before the arraignment. Arraignment? What the hell are you talking about? We'll have our best lawyer working with you, we are behind you 100%. Mike? What the-what the fuck is going on? You'll be fine. Now you'll have to turn yourself in first thing Monday morning. Is this because I didn't testify? How the hell did I get indicted? What the hell happened? I gotta go. Sorry, Mike. Don't tell me you're sorry, just go fix it. I'll text you the address and everything. Don't worry, it'll be okay. Fuck. It's very good. I'm so glad. Is everything alright? Yeah. This duck is amazing! You gotta give me the recipe. Oh, it's really easy actually, the secret is to blow dry it for two days. She means to air dry it, air dry. Mom, blow dry is for hair. Cheers. Cheers. Thanks so much for everything, it was great meeting all of you. Just a little something for you to bring to work. Oh thank you so much, Grace. It was so nice to meet you. This is so kind of you. Bye, darling. Hey, you'll be fine. Hang in there. Goodnight. Goodnight. I hope you enjoyed the evening. Ma, Ba. I got indicted. What? What happened? Your bosses are here. Oh thank you. We're not his bosses. Hey, Mike. Hey, how you doing? I want you to meet Bob Petke. He's in-house council for the union. He came in this weekend to meet with you. Yeah, it's a pleasure to meet you, Mike. I'm sorry we're meeting under these circumstances. It's so nice for you guys to visit. Sit, sit. Thank you. I'll jump right in. I talked to the DA and we've worked out a deal. A deal? If you plead guilty they'll recommend minimum sentencing. It's 2 years. You'll be out in 9 months. Wait, what? Can I get you a soda? Some water? Or tea? We have good tea. That's all right thank you. No, I'm okay thank you. How could this have happened? This is a very high profile case for them. It's an impossible situation. Impossible? You said this was all going away. We're doing what we can, but we can't ignore reality, Mike. You're being charged with Man 2. That's a potential 15 years. You take this thing to trial, you could see all of that. Two days ago you said this was all going to blow over, and now I'm going to prison? Ma. - Thank you. - Thank you. Lets not shoot the messenger here, Mike. We're working for you, all right? I mean, lets not fool ourselves, a kid is dead, you pulled the trigger. It was an accident. Well unfortunately it's not gonna play like that, Mike. The DA is going to try this case herself, and with all the press out there, the jury, they've already made up their minds. This is a Brooklyn jury, if we play the odds, you don't get a second chance. Come in. Hello, Cynthia, how's it going? Bill. To what do I owe the pleasure? It's been a while. It has. How's your daughter doing? Good. And John? Still wasting his time with all those books. That's good to hear. Cynthia, I'm sure you can guess why I'm here. Why is that? He made a mistake. He's a good kid, Cynthia. It doesn't matter if he's a good kid. He broke the law and he needs to face the consequences. Cynthia, he did not intend to do this. Why are you here, Bill? Is this because of your daughter? My daughter's business is her own. Don't you know I empathize with that family. I know their loss. I just don't think this is right. All rise, for the honorable Judge Sharon Mosca. Please sit. Ah, Ms. Kostas, it's nice to see you popping your head out of the office and getting in the trenches with the rest of us. Just trying to serve justice to my community your honor. Aren't we all? It's good to see you as well, Mr Petke. Thank you, your honor. Okay, let's get down to it counselors. Michael Tan, you are charged with manslaughter in the second degree and reckless endangerment. I understand there is a deal proffered? That's correct your honor, the state offers manslaughter two and a recommendation of leniency and minimum sentencing in exchange for a plea of guilty. Mhm. How does the defendant plea? How do you plea, Mr. Tan? Not guilty. Settle. Settle. Settle. Settle. Ms Kostas, Mr Petke, did you have an agreement before you came into this courtroom today? Railroaded. You've been railroaded. Two rookie cops shouldn't even be paired together. That's outrageous. Honestly, I'm glad you came to me now, but you should've come to me a lot sooner. There's a lot we can do. First things first, I need you to tell me anything you may have told anybody about this case, and I mean anybody. That means your friends, your family, colleagues, the barista at the corner coffee shop, anybody, no suprises. I guess I told- - Not now. Think about it. Write it down. What about your partner? Did you get your stories straight? He'll back me up. Well, make sure of that. If we lose him this whole thing could go south. Lock up the story. Do not talk to anybody else about this case without me present. I'm gonna set you up with some rebuttal testimony and I'm gonna get you with my shrink. Uh, shrink? Yes, we need a psych expert on our side. That's important. Now the most important thing, is to control the narrative. You're already being vilified in the press. We need to change that. I've got someone at News26. She'd love to do an interview. Talk to your parents. We need to get them on camera. On camera? Look most of the jury's gonna walk into that courtroom having already formed an opinion about you. Let's make sure it's a good one. This is all about optics. Most people aren't gonna actually watch the interview, but they are gonna see a screenshot of Mike with his parents sitting next to him. So even if they never listen to a word he says they're gonna think, "Oh, this is someone's son, and his parents are standing by him." That image is the most important part. Also, I think you need to be there. I'm not sure I wanna do that. Look, I'm not gonna lie to you. This case is about race. You think any of this would've happened if Mike were white? The department needed a scapegoat, they needed someone to throw to the wolves, so they found someone they thought was expendable. Also, a lot of the discussion about this case is going to be about the black issue. So, Candace, you sitting next to Mike would send a very powerful message. Look, you won't even need to speak. I don't think this is a good idea. If you follow my advice, you're gonna be okay. You're in good hands now. The DA's not gonna know what hit her. So let me know as soon as you talk to your parents, and I'll send over the information about the shrink. I'm not gonna do the interview. I don't want them on camera. Why are you so stubborn? That just cost me $1500. You think you know better than the best lawyer in New York? I don't think he's right. This is about the accident. We shouldn't be using mom and dad. We shouldn't be using the race card. I don't want you going to jail. So, if the interview has a chance of helping, we should do it. I don't wanna put you in that position. I want, I wanna do it. Make sure you think before you speak. You don't want anything coming back to haunt you. Whatever you do, remember the words we said not to use. Repeat them back to me. Guilty, sorry, apologize... Regret. Let me. Oh, I-okay. I'm glad you are here. Now they can see Mike is not racist. Yeah. What does this one mean? That's just a standard release. It's basically saying that we can use the footage wherever we need. And I think your lawyer's pretty much looked everything over already. Do we get to see the interview before it goes on TV? No, we don't do that, but we can get you a courtesy copy. You won't be able to change or edit it though. Okay. How are you doing? Okay. How you doing, Candace? Ready to get this over with. Great. Hi, excuse me, do you mind if we get you mic'd up now? Oh, I thought I wasn't talking? What? Oh, if you're uncomfortable, that's fine. I just think it might be good for Mike to see a little more from his loving fiance. Figured you'd want that too. Yeah, of course it's fine. Great! I'll be back. I'm gonna check in with the producers. If you can just turn around towards me, okay, and then I'm just gonna drop this down, Oh inside? Okay. We're not doing this. What? We're not doing it. Mike. Sorry, just one second. I don't want Candace or my family on camera. Wait, why? Is this about the Candace interview? Mike, we need that. No, I just don't want them on camera. Are you sure? Because we're all set up. Take a minute, let's talk about the strategy. No, I've made up my mind. No family or no interview. Alright. Alright, I'll let them know. You're making a mistake, Mike. You're paying me for my advice, and yet you're choosing to ignore it. You know, if you wanna lose this trial, by all means, tell me, but I'm on your side. See I'm just trying to keep you out of prison. I understand. Fine. You sure you know what your doing? No. Okay, everyone let's settle in. Thank you for doing this, Mike. Of course Is it your first time on camera? Does YouTube count? Mom, he looks fine. Okay, we're gonna roll camera and sound. Camera A speed. Sound speed. Camera B speed. Okay and Holly you go ahead and take it whenever you're ready. Joining us today is Officer Michael Tan, the officer involved in the fatal shooting of Jordan Wiggins two weeks ago. I know you've been busy since the indicment came down a few days ago, thank you for sitting down and talking with me today. Thank you for having me. Hey. Hey. The funny thing is, I forget I'm not one of them. It's only when something like this happens that you get put exactly where you should be. We're taught never to air our dirty laundry. We're taught to keep our heads down. Did you see the other police shooting that happened in the Bronx? The guy shot someone point blank. My brother's gun went through a wall. Why does he have to pay for these racist cops? They're just hanging him out to dry. This is not a black and white case. He didn't just look at a black man and shoot. And I know I'm biased, I love him, but where's the line? What time is it? Go back to sleep. Did Dean send those? Yeah. We look so young. It's been six weeks. Shit. I'm getting a lot of flack from people, why? Why do you wanna go on TV and talk to everybody about everything anyway? My lawyer thought it was a good idea. They can use it against you, you know that right? I'll tell you, never trust a lawyer, they're always out for themselves. Aren't we all? Well, you don't want people to think you're turning your back on the department. I'm not. It invites the wrong kind of people. You don't wanna be looking over your shoulder wherever you go. I'll remember that. You do that. How is Candace? All right I guess. As good as she can be. Gotta be hard on her. It'll be nice when this whole thing's over. I'm really sorry, man. You already said that. Don't worry about it. I know. I just need to say it again. We're partners, I got your back you've got mine. Hello? Hey, I'm sorry babe, what's up? I'm out with Stephanie. Are you okay? I'm fine. Come over if you want, we're at Joe's. No, it's okay, I'll just grab something back at home. Are you sure you're fine? We can meet up after if you want? No, I'll just, no you guys have fun. I have to go, I love you. That's a Glock 17. Nine millimeter. Gen 4. It's a reliable gun, very safe, won't go off on you accidentally. I'll take it. Great. If you can fill out this form, I'll need to see some ID and your permit to carry. I was told you'd be able to put in a rush order. Hold it! Hey! Mike. Hey, go back inside. What's going on? Hello? What? Okay. What now? You're not on call tonight. You have to go, my parents are coming. Mom, I know. Mom, it'll only be for a few days, okay? I'll see you at Grace's. Let's go, let's go, let's go. Mike, why did you agree to come in here, today? I know Larry told you to come, but you don't have to be here. Why did you want to come in? I want you to understand my side of the story. It's important to you that I understand your side of the story? Yeah, out there people are calling me names, and I want you to know I'm not those things. It's important to you to be a good person. Of course. You know, my mom raised me to be a good person, be kind, of course. How is your relationship with your mother? We're good. You two are close? We're a close family, it's just my sister, my parents and me. Now you're bringing someone new into the family? Mhm Larry tells me your fiance is African-American. Is that correct? Yeah. And your parents have no issues about that? No, they love her. The boy who was shot, he's African-American as well. Is that correct? Yeah. Do you generally get along with African-American people? Why is everybody trying to paint me like I'm some kind of racist? You know it could have been anybody. That bullet went through a wall. I couldn't see who it was. It could've been a Chinese family, it could've been a white family, anybody living in that corner unit, so this has nothing to do with race. How do you feel when someone describes you as a racist? I grew up in Brooklyn. There's black people everywhere. I'm fine with black people. I don't see things the way my parent's generation sees it. How's that? They, they grew up in China, you know, where people are homogenous. So how do you think they feel about African-American people? They used to be scared of black people, because of the news. But you know, and as police, you know, we, like statistically speaking, the crime rates are higher. But also that has to do with like, economy and education. My parents' friends are not as diverse as mine, but they've been here a long time. They understand the world that we live in. They understand that black people are not bad people and that Chinese people are not better than anybody else. Hi Mike, this is Holly Crane from News26. I just wanted to know if you'd like to comment on the press conference this morning. Perhaps we can set something up in the studio. Also, it might be good if Candace can join us as well, I know our viewers would really love to hear her perspective on everything that's hap- - Thank you for coming here today. Due to the heightened tensions on both sides of this trial, I ask that people remember that Officer Tan is innocent until proven otherwise, but with the recently acquired testimony of Officer Ryan Doheney, it is my determination, that the initial filing of manslaughter in the second degree is justified. Come on, Ryan, you shit! Open the door! Open the door! I know you're in there! I know you're in there fucking asshole! Hey! Turn the fuck around. What do you want? Did you ever give a fuck about him? Did you ever care about Mike, at all? You don't know what you're talking about. I know that he wouldn't even be in this mess if it wasn't for you, so don't act like you're so innocent in all of this. We went after a guy, cause that's what we do, we're fucking cops, we go after people who look shady. People who look shady! I'm not the one who fucking shot someone. It was an accident. His gun went off. And how is that? My gun didn't go off, cause my hand wasn't on the trigger, because I didn't pull it out when I didn't need to. You're a fucking asshole. I hope you drown. You're back early. What's all this? I thought I'd cook dinner for you. I'm almost done. Hey. Hey. So I've got 20 minutes before I have to take that out of the oven. Okay. So, take your pants off. Hold on let's just slow down for a minute all right. What's up? Look, it's just that I just got home, I need a minute, okay? Yeah. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry. It's fine. What is your problem? What? Is it so offensive I don't want to have sex right now? We always do everything you want, when you want it. I'm trying to do something nice for you, okay? Well maybe you can ask me what I want. Instead of jumping on top of me. You know what? Forget it. You don't appreciate anything. I don't appreciate anything? Do you know what kind of day I've had? Why do you think I'm cooking for you, asshole? I'm sorry. I'm sorry about Ryan. Karma will come back around. Candace, I-. Go back to sleep. I gotta go. I have meetings all day. But maybe we could grab dinner? Sounds good. See you tonight. Oh shit. Hi. This is Holly Crane. I'm not available- Excuse me. For deliveries you have to call up and have them come meet you. Not delivery, I'm here for News26. Your name? Mike Tan. I'm not on the list, I'm here to see Holly Crane. Yeah, I have a Mike Tan here to see Holly Crane. I see. She's not at her desk. Thanks. Sorry, but you're gonna have to wait. I'm gonna need to go up. 23rd floor. Hey, I'm so glad I caught you. Mike, I saw your missed calls, I was just about to get back to you. Sit, sit. I just wanna make sure that you don't use the photo on the news tonight. I'll even give an interview if you need it. It's just really important that you do not use that photo. It's already up online, you know? What? Our digital department posts everything almost immediately now. It's been up since last night. Hey, this is Candace. Leave a message. I'll let you guys talk. Please let me explain. I don't wanna talk about it. I made a mistake. You know ever since this happened, I've had people come up to me and say, "How can you be with someone like that? Candace, you're black, how can you marry a racist cop?" And I tell them, "You don't know what you're talking about, he's not like that." I stood by you. And in case you haven't noticed, Mike, I am black. Well, I guess you have. Babe, please let me explain. I think we did it, because after the response we've been getting since the interview, and after that photo you published, I really think the tide's beginning to turn in your favor. The opinion polls are up 20%, and I think by the time we go to trial you're gonna have the support of the entire Brooklyn community. Things are really looking up. I think we're gonna win this thing. Mom, I told you that the cleaning lady comes once a week. When do I have time to cook? Eat. Eat. Make better decisions. Ba, what's wrong? Shhh. I don't want your mother to hear. What is it? You wanna tell me why I found a gun in my house? You found a gun in the house? Don't play dumb with me. You remember what you promised your mother when you started this police thing? We were in danger. When you bring a gun into our lives you put us all in danger. You wanna get yourself killed. No one was gonna get hurt. Did you think anyone was gonna get hurt when that boy was shot? It only takes one shot, whether it's on purpose or not. Yeah. You know how much your mother wants grandchildren? What? You know if something happens to you, she might never have grandchildren, you wanna take that away from her? And you know Grace is not gonna give us any, you think we don't know? You are her only chance. You are so selfish. Your whole life, you think about yourself. Why don't you think about others for once? Michael. Do you have any idea, how a mother feels to lose a son? Your mom would never recover. You get that gun out of my house. Mom. Did I wake you? She left early. I got it, Ma. Thanks, Mom. Buzzer's broke. One second. Mrs. Wiggins? I understand if you don't want to speak to me. But I just wanted you to know, I'm sorry. I wanted to tell you that, I'm gonna go to the DA tomorrow, and tell her that I'm guilty. I just wanted you to be the first one to know that. I'm sorry I took your son away from you. Chief. Chief. Hey. Mike. Hey, can I just- if I could just talk to you for a second. I have to get home. Chief, please. What do you want? Candace won't talk to me and I- - I don't blame her. Please. What is it you want me to do, Mike? You want me to explain to her why you plastered her picture all over the internet saying, look I'm not a racist, I got a black girlfriend. I made a mistake. You made a choice. Now you have to live with it. Goodbye, Mike. Candace. You need to leave my dad out of this. Candace, I'm so sorry. Yeah, I don't wanna hear it. You know, all I've ever asked for is honesty, and I thought we were in this together, and you tricked me. You did exactly what the department does to my dad. You're no better than they are. I got scared. Candace, I'm gonna go to the DA tomorrow, I'm gonna tell them I'm guilty. I took his life, and his mother, she's never gonna see her son again and that's my fault. Can I see you? I don't know what it is you can say. We don't have to say anything, all right just stay there, I'll be right over. Okay. How you doing tonight, sir? Gun! No, no, it's not what it looks like. - Don't move! - I'm a cop! Shots fired, shots fired, near 93-near 43rd and 1st, we need a bus immediately. Copy, shots fired at 43rd and 1st, Fuck. Fuck. Hello? What?
