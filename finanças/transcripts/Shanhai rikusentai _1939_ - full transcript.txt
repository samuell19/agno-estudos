The interests of different countries are closely intertwined here, with violent sparks flying at one point and chaos at another. Only Chinese live in the southern part of the city. Otherwise, most of Shanghai is occupied by foreign concessions. The concessions are essentially divided into two areas. As seen on a map, there is the joint concession primarily under Japanese, English, American and Italian jurisdiction In that joint concession are 30,000 Japanese residents in the so-called Hongkou District. The other concession is administered by the French. On July 7, 1937, the Chinese Army's unlawful, aggressive acts at the Marco Polo bridge ignited a conflict that spread throughout the northern part of China. In Shanghai too, one can sense the gathering of a storm. What only became known later was the fact that the Chinese had already established fortified positions in key locations surrounding the Hongkou District. The Japanese side was trying to maintain peace as much as possible with a policy of non-agression. "Crush Japanese Imperialism!" "Our Nation Hangs in the Balance" "Fight to the End" "For for the Life of the Nation" But on July 24, Sadao Miyazaki, Seaman First Class of the Shanghai Marines, was kidnapped by Chinese soldiers dressed as civilians. The Chinese living in the Hongkou and Zhabei districts, anticipating war and fearing flying bullets, began fleeing en masse from Suzhou Creek to the Joint and the French Concessions. Meanwhile, Japanese residents in the Hongkou District in the Joint Concession were temporarily housed in an elementary school that had been opened for this purpose. In the midst of such a threatening atmosphere, the assassination on August 9 of Lieutenant Isao Oyama by the Chinese Army happened suddenly and unexpectedly. At the time, Lt. Oyama commanded the western naval contingent that had been assigned to guard the factories of Toyota Boshoku, Naigai Cotton, and others in the western part of Shanghai. At around 5:00 p.m. that day, he went to inspect the area in a car driven by Seaman Apprentice Saito. But on the way he was attacked by members of the China "Peace Preservation Corps". Despite this serious insult of this anti-Japanese aggression and continued Chinese propaganda, the Japanese side made every effort to resolve the situation peacefully. But this only stirred the contempt and conceit of the Chinese. Such was the situation on August 12 at Lt. Oyama's and Seaman Saito's memorial. "Marine Headquarters" We are deeply moved by your efforts to protect the rights and interests of the Japanese people living here. You had no time to fight the Chinese soldiers, who are tyrannical, insolent, and devilish. We truly did not expect you to be martyred for your work. Our blood is still surging, and our rage knows no bounds. You and I were chosen together to enter the Naval Academy in 1929. We ate and slept together day and night, engaged in friendly competition, and shared many hardships and privations. In October last year, we were both appointed as company commanders in the Shanghai Marines 1st Battalion. The friendship between us is not limited to flesh and bone. They share the same prosperity when they live, and the same fate when they die. Oh, sadly. Now that I have come to this point. I feel a mixture of emotions and I am deeply moved by the thought that we are now separated in our dreams. I can only mourn for you, but know that you have roused us with your heroic end. We are truly in awe of your loyal spirit. The day is not far off when we will do our utmost in the cause of loyalty. Without regard for a single arrow, we will chastise the wicked and determine to win the entire war. This we must do. May the spirits of the dead, if they wish, come and visit us. Stand! Salute! From this moment on, I will dedicate myself that our deployment will not come to an unnecessary and tragic end. This is no time to think. Whenever the order comes to start fighting, that will be the time for a battle of mourning. I will avenge this loss. You should all be prepared to do the same. All troops, advance! The end. Each platoon, board! Each platoon is to proceed to its assigned destination. Everyone, there is an emergency evacuation order. Gather at the elementary school gymnasium immediately! I am one of the residents here. My name is Ikeda. We're protecting the refugees gathered at the elementary school about five blocks from here. We ask for your assistance. Of course! You can count on us. Platoon Leader! I've got a rope! Yamaguchi team, get to work! Those houses over there are suspicious. There is a lot of movement on the roof. Whistles have been heard several times coming from that house over there. You need to reinforce your position here with more sandbags. Platoon Leader, are you all right? That just now appears to have been a misfired shot. No carelessness! This position is the closest to headquarters. That’s 500 meters at most. This position is exposed. Nothing better. Ahead is a sizable unit. If they take one step on that bridge, then you have to stop them! Is that clear, Takahata? Well, as long as my eyes are black, we'll hold. Damn! Snipers! Platoon leader, Okura got hit! Over there from the first floor. Company commander, please keep down. Hey there, pardon me. There don't seem to be any Japanese left anywhere in the city. Has the shooting started? No, just taking precautions for now. They say that the city is full of Chinese soldiers. We might already be surrounded. That's not true. It is true. It feels like something could start anytime. Who are you? I'm from the newspaper. My name is Tsunekichi Miyajima. Hasn't there been another attack? At one position, two men injured. I hear that place is full of snipers. The city is full of elite Chinese soldiers from the Central Army. More coming in by train, too. This time, they mean business. Could be. They have been trying to provoke us into attacking, haven't they. Yeah, I guess so. Ten days, is that right? No, less because it's by airplane. Isn't that what the Air Force is so proud of? I know that you have been struggling for the past 20 years. The mediation committee is finally hiring. What the heck is going on? August 13 "Have a dog if you want!" Company Commander. Wait, I'll get it. Company Commander, report on enemy activity. The enemy has opened fire on us. End. Understood. Dammit! Is the company commander there? Hello, this is the platoon leader. Can we return fire? No, no, no. Don't shoot back. Yes, I know. Stand fast! No matter provocation. Don't fire until the order comes! Squad leader, hold your fire. Yamaguchi ! Battalion orders, do not return fire on enemy. End. It's getting worse. Fighting seems unavoidable. Battalion orders, yes. Permission granted! Company commander to all positions. Open fire! Yes. Squad leader, permission granted. Permission granted. Open fire! Now! First, that racket. Now this. Reminds me of a Pachinko parlor. That's right. They are making such a big deal out of it, so I've got to deal with it. This? That's right. Ah, this is the reason. We will have to get more. Company commander, please check. Did the bullet go through? You'll be alright. If it's out, that's good. Sir! We are reservists from Shanghai who have come to assist. Get back to safety! It's too dangerous here. That will not be possible. We are soldiers, too. Then please take these two wounded men back with you. Get the stretchers. I don't want to go back. Company commander, I do not want to go back! Nakamura, go get treated. Come back as soon as you are healed. I hate it! I hate it! We will go then. I wish you well. Oh, and then take care of security in the Hongkou district. If the worst happens, you will continue the fight from the rear positions! I don't want to go! Let me out! Let me fight! I don't want to go! I don't want to go! There are about two enemy companies here in Building X. In addition, there is a company here, the same here, in this factory about 300 meters behind there is an extremely large unit. At 4:10 p.m., about two enemy battalions were concentrated in this factory. Here? Yes. That is a lot of activity. It looks like an attack is being planned for tonight. Yes. Any trouble getting back? No, all clear. By the way, the reservists asked us to give you a message: "Make hell hot for the enemy." That will be your job. Company commander! Company commander! Oh. Hirooka, what's up? I need to know what do to. About what? These Chinese women were hiding in a nearby house. Have you searched them? Yes, sir. They don't have anything suspicious with them. We don't have any room for them here. Put them in the temple next door. Check them again carefully. Orders. Enemy activity increasing. Everyone to remain vigilant. Tonight's passwords: mountains, rivers. Everyone got that? Yes! Okay, I understand! Where is that? That's not the front line. Must be in the Wusong area. What's going on there? That must be the transportation area. We're taking fire from houses 500 meters ahead of us right now. The enemy is planning a general attack on us. At that time, it was reported that the Chinese Central Army besieging the periphery of Shanghai was massing a 100,000-strong army with elite troops in the center. Disregarding the numerical inferiority of our soldiers, this powerful enemy force intended to break through our lines before the arrival of the reinforcements from Japan, seize the Marines Headquarters and take the Hongkou District outright. Any word on reinforcements? Not yet. Minami? Yes. Company orders... Yes. The detached platoon should occupy and secure the waterfront. Reinforce two squads from the company reserve along with tanks and armored vehicles. Time 1:32 p.m. Platoon Leader, please provide one ambulance vehicle for transporting the wounded. Company commander, forgive me. Well done. Well done. Cheer up, everyone. You're doing great. Company commander, the ambulance is here. Get the stretchers. Everyone, please take care of yourself and come back healthy. Yamaguchi, take that to the women who were here yesterday. They're back. No, no! Don't accept anything from the likes of them! What are you talking about? Why shouldn't I? I wouldn't accept so much as a crumb from them. Aren't you ashamed? What's wrong with getting food for my child if they want to give it? Open your eyes! Don't you know what they really want from us? Fool! We're...we're only trying to show kindness! Everyone, please evacuate this room immediately! Cease fire!! I've seen her. She's a pretty girl but quite a spitfire. Lots of anti-Japanese attitude. Well, a strong heart... ...is what makes a strong spirit, doesn't it? It's not just Chinese women who are strong in their hearts. Japanese mothers are very strong. One of them ran out of the shelter yesterday - bullets flying everywhere - for the sake of their children. I'm sure she likes you. How about letting her treat you? Nonsense, I'm under constant surveillance by my own mother. Company commander, everything is ready here. Artillery is ready to attack the Bazi Bridge. Also tanks and armored cars. Everything is clear here. Let's go! Everything is clear here. Let's go! Ready! Ready! Open fire! Open fire! Report! Hello? Hello? Forward position, hello? Hello? Is that the forward position? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, all right, all right. Tell the platoon leader. The main enemy unit is shifting its current line and going back to its original position in Building X. Have artillery cease fire. In addition, one squad from battalion reserve will reinforce the forward position. End. Platoon Leader. Select five men to form a special attack squad to attack Building X. Select five men for a special attack squad to attack Building X. Company commander, any messages for battalion? To Battalion commander from company commander. Our forward forces made a ferocious and bold attack but could not dislodge the enemy. We will be sending a special attack squad to attack Building X. I understand. Orders. You five men will form a special attack squad for burning out the enemy in Building X after sunset. End. Orders. We five men will form a special attack squad for burning out the enemy position at Building X after sunset. End! Hey, Kodama. Yes. Go with them. Yes. Men, you must complete this mission at all costs. But try to return safely tonight. I want to take care of yourself. Attention! Inspection! Good...good...good...good... Where is your thousand-stitch belt, Hirooka? What would the company commander think? You can't die under these circumstances. I am a terrible soldier, sorry! Platoon leader. Do one thing, and do it with all your might. I'm going to go out on a limb and say we will not fail. Oh, Kodama. It's almost sunset, prepare to leave. Yes, sir. Prepare to leave. Company Commander. The command platoon is here. No work but still a big job. Do one thing, and do it with all your might. You're still a funny guy. Company commander, no word yet from the special attack squad. End! Yes! Hello? Hello? Hello, hello, hello. Oh, hello, hello. Is the platoon leader present? Platoon leader, company commander is calling. What? Okay, I've got it. Keep it moving. Okay. Kodama. The special attack squad is to depart immediately. Squad leader, begin your attack. They're off. Good. Come on, come on, come on. company commander. Company commander, the enemy has started another night attack. Oh. Is this the woman who wouldn't take food from us? Mother, I'm hungry. I'm hungry. What is he saying? He is complaining of hunger. When was the last time they got food? Same as us. They must be hungry. Kodama, give them the eggs. This one seems pregnant. Ask her when the baby is due. Pregnant? Baby soon? Soon. She says soon. I see. Company commander, is everything all right? How are they feeling? They must be very weak. Not so much, but one of them is expecting a child. Ah, Maeda. Isn't your wife expecting too? From the last letter, any day now. Oh, that's great. Kodama, did you ask about the woman's condition? Not much. My Chinese is just a smattering. Hirooka's is better. Say no more about that guy. In order! Five minutes of sleep, all men! Okay. Okay. Okay, lie down. I haven't slept for three days. You'll all be in the line of fire tomorrow. Get some sleep! Yes! You get some sleep. Yes, but what about the special attack squad? Don't worry about them, go to bed! Why don't you go to bed? Stop that! Go to sleep! August 15 Platoon leader, this position must be prepared to do whatever it takes to stop the enemy's aggressive attacks. The enemy is massing in the north and west areas of that northern depot. They have dozens of times more troops than we have. I am sure they will attack this week. We cannot attack their stronghold since it is right next to a foreign concession. No matter what happens, don't let go of this position. Whatever it takes, you do it, understand? Stop! Oishi, you've been hit hard. You have to take it easy. Get medical treatment. Understand? Come back immediately. I know you're all hungry. How are you doing? Can you continue to hold out? We can. I have a favor to ask you all. Yesterday, an enemy shell hit the headquarters and destroyed their oven. As a result, food is not being distributed to the front line. So, we would like to send them our portion of food that we are cooking now. Yes! We would to given them our food! Please. We would love to! Thank you very much. Mom, let me give something. Give that to me. Here, use these. Are you sure? Platoon leader, take half of the platoon and move in front of the enemy position. Like you said: Do one thing, and do it with all your might. Yesterday afternoon, the Navy issued a major statement. They are now committed to doing everything necessary and effective. Yes, that's right. Now we will be getting reinforcements. Company commander! The command platoon leader is moving half of the command platoon to reinforce the forward positions. Okay, let's go. Company commander, command platoon leader requests you observe. Understood. Let's go. Command platoon leader, what's going on? What's happened? She was pale and collapsed. She hasn't eaten anything, I think she came to drink water from the well. Kodama, give her this. Take this. It's from the company commander. Ambulances are all out. You'll have to wait. Yes. Company Commander. "I received your letter. We're in fights that go on for days," "but I'm getting better and better at dealing with it." "I guess the baby hasn't come yet, maybe it's here by now, but" "if it still hasn't, ask the doctor for advice!" "If it's a boy, then we're going to" "raise it to be a soldier, that's...” Water...water. You have to hold out a little longer. Corpsman Miyagi? Yoshikawa can drink? Yes, I think it will be fine. Then give him a drink of this. Yes, hello? Battalion orders, yes, yes. First: Apparently the enemy is planning a most energetic effort to occupy our positions. Yes, yes, yes! Second: All positions make adequate preparations for fighting at night. Third: It is possible to let the enemy get close enough in the night to then destroy them in one decisive blow. Fourth: All positions must impress the enemy with courage and fighting spirit. Fifth: Fighting is expected to be even tougher than in the last few days. End of command message! Company commander? Understood. Who is that? Hello. Yes, yes. Forward position. Shooting has started. Yes, yes! We are in the middle of an attack. Yes, yes! We are under enemy fire all across the front. Yes! Company commander, report from Position A. Enemy attacks more and more furious, all troops counterattacking. End! An armored car has been ordered here by the battalion commander! Send out more ammunition to all positions. Position A is simultaneously being attacked and fighting the enemy. Number of enemy forces currently unknown. Position A is simultaneously being attacked and fighting the enemy. Enemy attacks becoming more and more vigorous. End. Enemy attacks becoming more and more vigorous. Request reinforcements. Requesting reinforcements. Reply. You must hold on a little longer! It will not be long! Reinforcements will be sent soon. End. Hello, Hello! Company commander, I've lost them! What! Are you the director? Yes. I'm the leader of the northern reserve detachment! Please get everyone moved to the apartment building! We're protecting the second line! We'll push the enemy back! We can't have everyone rush out at once! We teachers will protect everyone together! All teachers, please gather at the entrance to the auditorium! Please leave the school building in an orderly manner! Hello...hello? Still not getting through. Kodama. Send reinforcements to Position B. Four killed, fourteen wounded, seven seriously. Without reinforcements and ammunition, we won't be able to hold out! End. Kato. Orders! Reinforce Position B with armored car immediately. Sir, we need more water... You can get some there. Company commander! Go help him. Company commander, Position D reporting the enemy is attacking with greater ferocity. Reinforcements and ammunition are urgently needed. End! Understood. With your permission, I will now return to my position and continue to fight. Message. Enemy continues...enemy continues to press his attacks. Our position in danger of being overrun at any time. Requesting immediate reinforcement along with additional ammunition. End. Yes, I hear you. Company commander, I have re-established contact. Order. You can't let the enemy cross that bridge. That would expose our flanks. You have to hold out until reinforcements are available. Understand? Understand? Understand! Hello...hello! Company commander, I've lost them again. Sir, I'm back now. Nakamura, why are you back? I am ready to fight. You've not healed yet. Go back! I can still shoot. Company commander, I can shoot with my left arm. Request the armored car be sent here. We can't hold out much longer. Company commander, report from the forward position, enemy continues to attack us fiercely. Every man fights with all his might, but the enemy is encircling us. Hello, hello? Hello, hello? Company commander, I've lost them. Re-establish contact. Get all tanks or other armored vehicles to the forward position as soon as possible. Company commander, they're back! Yes, yes. Yes, what? Yes, yes. New attacks by enemy forces threaten to ... Hello? Hello? It's off again! Yes, yes, yes. Company commander. From battalion headquarters, We are sending you all remaining tanks, armored vehicles and troop reserves. You must continue to defend all positions. Fight until the last man! End! Understood. Messenger! Orders! Go to all forward positions and tell them that battalion is sending us all remaining reinforcements. They are to fight to the last man. End! Kodama. Place this on the pillar in the main hall. Kato. Message to the battalion commander. The company commander leading all troops of the command platoon on an attack of the enemy positions. What does it say? "Good people will be protected by the Japanese army. - Company commander Kishi" The Japanese soldiers will protect us. They will save us! The Japanese soldiers are good people. Yoshikawa. Take those ten men. I'll take the rest. Our Position B is struggling. The company commander assembles this reserve force as reinforcements! Forward! What's happening? Our position hit by enemy artillery. Everyone dead except four men! We're out of ammo. The fight is ... hopeless! Drive to Position B! You, get some ammo! Forward! Hey! Who's there! It's me! Okubo! Okubo is alive! You're alive! Do you have any ammunition? Not very much. Okubo! Okubo! Still there? You're here. Yamaguchi, stay strong! You can't die! Company commander! What are your orders? Give us your orders! I know what you're talking about now! Forgive me! Well done, Yamaguchi! Not you! I have more bullets for you! Keep firing. You should pull back. Those without bullets, get some from the dead and shoot! Where is that ammunition? Sir, there's no ammunition left. Kodama! Kodama! Battalion message! Battalion message! At four o'clock this morning, a superior force of our Army landed in Wusong with the help of the Navy! They are heading our way. Reply message: We cannot wait for the Army to get here. The Marines are the last line of defense. Hey! Call out your name starting from the right! Everyone, on my order ... Charge! Sir, we have no bullets. With bayonets... Charge! The Shanghai Marines are now being relieved on the front lines. Additional reinforcements are on the way to attack all enemy positions. End! The Army has landed! The Army has arrived! I just saw them and they are protected by warships. That's good to hear. There is great news! Great news! The enemy is now being bombed by our naval air force. I wonder if a Navy will also bomb Nanking? Over the next two months, the Army moved south toward Shanghai while crushing the enemy south of the Yangtze River. The Shanghai Marines were still steadfastly defending the Hongkou District even though outnumbered by tens of thousands. If you only look at the ruins of today's Shanghai, you can vividly imagine the fierce fighting that took place in those two months and the costly sacrifices that paid for it. Together, the land and naval forces attacked the enemy from both sides, pinched them north of the Yangtze River and annihilated them. In mid-November, after two and a half months, Shanghai was forced to surrender completely. Here, war ruins of present-day Shanghai are to be visited. I would also like to revisit the places where the blood of brave hero Marines was spilled and commemorate their sacrifice. The flag of our Navy flutters in the blue sky. The lofty building of the Marines Headquarters. In the city of Shanghai, which is overlooked from the roof, peace has now been fully restored. Shanhai rikusentai END Translation: dduke2104
