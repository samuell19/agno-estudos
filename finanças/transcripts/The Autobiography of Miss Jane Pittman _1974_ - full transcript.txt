♪ Happy Birthday to you Happy Birthday to you ♪Happy Birthday, Miss Jane, ♪Happy Birthday to you Enoch, what you put all these candles on this cake for? Never mind, just blow 'em out. Just blow 'em out. I ain't got enough breath to be blowing out these candles. See that? Happy birthday! Are you gonna be having me this time next year, Lena? God willing. God willing. Don't wanna be here by myself. I will be here with you, Jane. Oh, Mar, I know you gon' be here. Yes, child. Oh! Happy birthday. Hello, Miss Jane. Well, hello, Jimmy. Come on in. Happy birthday. Can I speak with you, Miss Jane? Well, Jimmy... Listen. Go on outside before they stuff me full of cake. Me help? How? Going with us down to the courthouse. When we get ready to move. I'm 109, oh, 110. I'm too old. I can't even do nothing but get in the way. You can inspire the others. Hey, Jimmy. What you got going in the back of your head? We're going to have one of our girls drink from the white peoples' fountain down at the courthouse. The white folks' fountain? That old loon Edgar won't let her get anywhere near that fountain. You know, when they passed that segregatin' law, that old loon come round slobberin' and, hon, I tell him, "Edgar, if you touch me, I'll take my cane and crack your skull." We want Guidry to arrest her. If one of us did it, we'd just get beat up. Now, what you want old fat Guidry to arrest her for? So we can march down to the courthouse. Oh, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy. You see these folks 'round here ain't ready for nothing like that yet. That's our job. Talk to 'em, Jimmy. Talk to the young ones. We don't have that kind of time, Miss Jane. What else do you got, Jim? I've been carrying a scar on my back ever since I was slave. That's precisely why we need you. Your mere presence with us will bring forth the multitudes. Jimmy... I understand. Believe it or not, I was once young myself. That girl is gonna drink from the fountain tomorrow, Miss Jane. Well... God moves in a mysterious way, His wonders to perform. I'll wait for Him to give me the sign, Jimmy. And He's right most times. I'll wait on Him. That girl is gonna drink from the fountain tomorrow, Miss Jane. Excuse me. I'm, uh... I'm looking for Miss Jane Pittman. Well, you'll find Miss Jane in the last cabin on your left down that lane. Thank you. Thank you very much. Tell me again. What you wanna know about Miss Jane for? I'm writing a feature story. A what? Is this for radio? I'm gonna be on television? The Ed Sullivan Show? No, ma'am. It... it's, uh, for a magazine from New York. Oh. Always preferred Brooklyn myself. Oh... You wanna know how come I live so long. Well, I'd like to hear whatever you have to say. 'Bout what? You don't have to say a thing to him, Miss Jane. Uh, I understand you were a slave. Lots of peoples were slaves. Well, yes, but you're still alive. Just 'bout. Well, I... I thought maybe you could tell me what things were like in those days. In those days? Hmm. Tomorrow. Miss Jane's tired. She'll decide tomorrow. This mornin' marks Bayonne's first brush with the so-called civil rights movement, as a group of negro agitatos confronted Sheriff Guidry at the "white folks only" drinkin' fountain at the courthouse. There were no serious injuries reported, although several arrests were made. Well, it's her son Jimmy they got in the jail there. She could tell ya. Well, I wanna do an interview with him as soon as things settle down. I... I came down here to talk to you, Miss Jane. Are you 110 years old? So they tell me. How far back can you remember? How far back do you wanna go? Well, the war. Can you remember...? What war? Second World, First World, or that... that Cuban war? You... You remember the Spanish-American War? Spanish-American War. I can do a whole lot better than that. Do you remember getting your freedom? I hope I never forget it. How far back do you wanna go? You wanna go back that far? I'll go back as far as you wanna go. Now, you don't have to tell him nothin', Miss Jane. I know that, Lena. But if I don't, he's just gonna sit here and worry me half to death. You mean it's all right? How far? Do you want me to go back as far as I can go? That's even further than when the freedom come. That thing ain't gonna bite me, is it? Oh, no, ma'am. No, it's just a tape... Oh, my, my, my. Well, where to start? Where to start, Lena? Honestly, I wouldn't talk to this man here. Oh, Lena, you just fill in the gaps. Well, I can see who got their mind made up. You might as well start with them over there. What? Oh, these. Mm. Lord, Lord, Lord. I've had these things ever since I can remember. Two rocks? You don't know a whole lot, do ya? ♪♪ Oh, it was a cold day. Wet and muddy. I won't ever forget it. The rebel army, they come first. Officers on horses and troops just walkin'. They was half dead, draggin' they guns in the mu, they was so tired. Some of 'em weren't much oldr than I was. Ma'am. Would it be askin' too much if we could use some of your water? We don't have very much time. I'd be honored, sir. Colonel, would you do me the pleasure of takin' some brandy wine? Well, thank you kindly. I would like that. Ticey! Ticey! Don't just stand there gapin'. Get them troops some water. ♪♪ These are the same ones, mind ya, who told their peoples when the war was gettin' started, "Keep my food warm. I'm gonna kill me a few Yankees and be home for supper." Colonel! Colonel! Over there. Colonel, I seen 'em. They're right down the road. They're right behind me. Ma'am, I'm truly grateful, and God bless you all. Our hearts are with you. If left up to me, I'd turn them niggers loose, if left up to me. Yeah, if the Yankees want 'em, let the Yankees have 'em. Ticey, what are you doing standing there for? You go get some more water. What for, Mistress Bryant? They're all gone now. Oh, you don't think Yankees drink water, too? Don't you hear that rifle fire? I gotta haul that water for them Yankees, too? You don't wanna get boiled in oil now, do you? They're coming! They're coming! The Yankees coming! - Where? - Over there. Oh, my God. They're coming right through the fields. Where's the master? He just went down the street. Stop pointing. And watch your tongue. They may be the devil. Now, you hear me, don't you say one word about the master or one word about the silver, or they gonna skin you alive before they boil you in oil. Halt! Good day. Ma'am. May I offer you some brandy wine? Why, thank you, ma'am. What happened to your shoes? I took mine off. They hurt my feet. Hey. What's your name? Ticey, Master. They ever beat you, Ticey? Now, you can tell me. What do they beat you with? Cat o' nine tails, Master. Why'd they whip you? I go to sleep looking after the young mistress' children. You're nothing but a child yourself. How old are you right now? I don't know, Master. Ticey, I'm not a master. I'm a plain old ordinary soldier. My name's Corporal Lewis Brown. Now, can you say "corporal"? No, Master. Bet you can. Go on, try. I can't say that. Can you say "Lewis"? Yes, Master. All right. Well, you call me Lewis. And I'm gonna call you something besides Ticey. Ticey's a slave name. And now, back in Ohio, there's lots of pretty names for a girl like you. What names you got? Oh, uh, Heloise. Sophie, Marguerite, Jane... I like Jane. Okay, you take it. Now, from now on your name is Jane. Not Ticey anymore. Jane. When you get older, you change it to anything you want, but until then, your name is Jane. Mount up! Ha! Get there. Come on. If anybody gives you any more trouble, you just come on up to Ohio and tell me. We'll fix it. ♪♪ Hey! Go on! A year later, Master Bryat called us all together. We knew something big was happenin', 'cause he had on his best sut and his top hat. Now, everybody that can stand or crawl gotta hear this. That's all of us, Master Bryant. All right, then. I got something to read to you all. Now, these papers come through while the war was still goin', but... wasn't any point in readin' 'em 'til now. "Whereas on the 22nd day of September in the Year of our Lord 1862, a proclamation was issued by the President of the United States containin', among other things, the following: That on the first day of January in the Year of our Lord 1863 all persons held as slaves within any state or designatd part of a state, the people whereof shall thn be in rebellion against the United States, shall be then, thenceforward and forever... "free." Well, it just goes on like that. Now... All I wanna say is that... y'all can stay and work on shares. I... I... I can't pay ya nothing, since I ain't got nothin' myself since them Yankees went through here last time. Y'all can stay, y'all can go. Just as you please. Now, if... If y'all stay, I promise, I... I'll be as fair, as... As fair with you as I always been with y'all. Now, then, that's that. You shut up there! Shut up this moment! Now, you just shut up this noise here. You comin' in here talkin' about, "I'm leavin'." Where to? What you gonna do? What do we care, Unc? We is free to choose. They's all kind of places to go. Gold in California. Hold it. Hold it. What you gonna eat? Well, Unc, I eats food. How you gonna pay for all this food, you big young buck? With money, Unc. Same as any other free man. And from where is you gettin' this fortune? Honest wage for an honest day's work. You don't know nothin' about outside. You belong right here on this plantation. Y'all do what y'all want. I'm headin' for Ohio. What about them paterollers, honey? They got Yankees now. They'll pay for them just as free as the masters. They ain't gonna beat ya. And they didn't kill you before 'cause you belonged to somebody. Now you ain't owned but by fate, Ticey. My name's Jane, and I'm headed for Ohio just as soon as you point the way north. Very well, Miss Jane. North be that-a-way from here. Now, the sun's on the right in the mornin' and on the left in the evenin'. You got all this? All right. Now, remember, God bless you, child. Mistress had tears in her eyes, and she was kissin' all the peoples good-bye. She even kissed me. ♪♪ We walked for days through the swamps. Stayed off the main roads, 'cause them paterollers would kill a free man quick as he would a runaway slave. No one knew where we was headin', so Big Laura, tough as any man, showed us the way. Come on, Jane. Come on. Paterollers! The paterollers! Get up! Hit him again! Get that man there! Hit him! Stupid animal! You wanna go to Ohio with me? If anybody asks, these just two plain old rocks. Not of iron and flint that Big Laura used, but two plain old rocks. Make sure to get to Ohio the same time we do. So Big Laura's little boy Nd and me, we started walking toward Ohio. There wasn't much left of the South in those times. All that the Yankees couldn't lift and take with 'em, they burned. Once in a while, though, you'd see something still standin'. You! Get away from my fence! Excuse, ma'am. Could you tell me which way Ohio? Please, ma'am? If you don't get away from my fence, I'm gonna have that old dog there point the way to Ohio. I just wanted to know if I was headed the right way. I don't know nothin' about no Ohio. Get away from my fence! We headed on, then. Can you tell me if there's a spring around here? You don't see no spring around here, do you? Me and this boy here are awful thirsty. Stay there. Here. You don't think I'm gonna let you foul this cup with your black mouth, do you? Hold your hands out. Don't ya'll think I love niggers just because I'm giving you water. I hate y'all. Hate ya! All of you! You're the cause of all the trouble we're havin' around here. All this ravishin' and burnin'. Yankee and nigger soldiers all over the place. They're stealin' and killin'. They done killed my boy and my man, and you're the cause of it! And I hope to God they kill you! I'd kill ya myself if I weren't God-fearin'! Look what you done to me! Look what you done! Look what you done to me! ♪♪ Whoa! You two must be pretty tired, standing on that grave. Old hat's so weather-dry, can't tell who it belonged to. Lot of them in there, though, whoever they was. Where y'all goin'? We headin' north. We headin' north. You ain't going nowhere standing there. Come on, now. Headin' north, hey? For the big freedom, hey? Well, you gonna have to cross the river, you know. - River?! - The mighty Mississip'. I ain't crossin' no river nuttin. You gon' cross the mighty Mississip' or y'all ain't headin' north. You two keep still. I know these two. Let me do the talking. See you got you some niggers there, Joe. Yes, sir. For the Bondurant's place. Can't say they much, but you got to start with somethin', sho. Feed 'em. They'll grow. Will do. Yes, sir. You two, get off here. Where the river? I don't see no river. Never mind. Just get off. I don't see no river. ♪♪ Where you think you're goin'? Me and this boy here are headed for Ohio. Ohio? Who y'all for? We ain't for nobody. We just as free as you are. All right, little free nigger. You got money? It take a nickel to ride on here. You got a nickel each? - No, sir. - Then, get on back. Lucas, take care of them. So we walked and walked. Round in circles, prob'ly. Keepin' an eye on the way for rednecks and pateroller, who was on the lookout for freemen. Finally, we was so tired and hungry, and not knowin' where else to go, I signed on at the Dye plantation. I didn't know it was gonna take me 12 long hard years to get off from that place. They ain't no rocks. Ned knew that. They're flints, for makin' fire. - Is she all right? - Oh, yeah. That's just Miss Jane's way. She like to take advantage of her age that way, skippin' good-byes and all. Says she had too many, anyway. Uh, excuse me. Got a whole bunch of telephone messages here for ya. Oh, thank you. In slavery, you had two dresses, a pair of shoes and a coat. Hey. You like that stuff? Yes, ma'am. That's homegrown, you know. Not from no cans. You ever ate sugar cane before? No, ma'am. I know you ain't never chopped none. No, ma'am, I haven't. Man has to chop sugar cane for a while for a living to appreciate it. Most people ain't never eat sugar cane raw today, black or white. I work on the Dye plantation for 12 long years, and I know what went on. I was there. I guess I must've been about... I guess I was about 22, 23. All right. Let's go. Yo, yo. Whoa. You all know and trust and love me. Vote for me, send me to Washington to ensure... Colored politicians used o come around and sign us up for votes and more than just a few got sent to Washington, but Reconstruction never really worked. It wasn't too long before carpetbaggers, black and white, moved in to take from the South what the war didn't. For a while there, it looked like things was gonna be all right for us. We had a little school on the place where we could go at night. Ned, he must have been about 18, then. Oh! You want an education? We're gonna give you an education! No, don't! No! No! No! Oh, oh, no! No, no! Oh, my God! No! Oh, my God! My God! My God! Colonel Dye was gettin' crazier by the day, sometimes wearin' his unifom like the war never ended. Yes, and no more nigger politicians 'round here. That schoolhouse up there is gonna stay shut down 'til I can find y'all a competent teacher. Y'all don't need a pass to leave the place, like before. Y'all do right by me and any group stop you on the road, you just tell me, and I'll fix it right up. Yeah. I... I can't pay y'all 'til the end of the year, but you can draw, uh, rations and clothing from the store. That suit ya? Stay. If that don't, then, catch up with them coattail-flyin' scallywags and the rest of them hot-footin' niggers. Ned started teachin' the peoples to write. He even wrote to Washington, D.C., but they never wrote back. You know, he found out about committees bein' formed that helped the coloreds with their rights, and so he formed one, too. And there ain't no such tax as protection livin'. If someone tries to burn your crop, tell us. We know how to prosecute. The vigilantes heard about Ned's committee, and they started watchin' hi, but that didn't stop him non. Ho! Where's he at? Who? Who? Who? You know who I'm talkin' about. No, I... Ned thievin' Douglass that's who. Or whatever he's callin' himself these days. I don't know where he is. She don't know, Bo. No! Still don't know where he's at? No. We'll get him. I'm telling you, that boy of yours better stop being so serious. I don't like him gettin' so serious. You understand? She understands. Come on, let's go. We'll find him. Ma, what happened? What happened where? Eat your food. This. What happened? They was here lookin' for you tonight, Ned. They're fixing to kill you. They will if you don't leave this place. I can't, Mama, you know that. You got to. I can't leave these people. They haven't got anybody else who will fight for them except the committee. Ned, you ain't worth nothin' to nobody dead. You pack your things now. Take the road to New Orleans and take a boat leavin' for Kansas. You come with me, then. I can't. I can't, Ned. I'm tied here. You're comin' with me, Mama. They'll hurt you again. They can't do me nothin', Ned. I don't have what you have. I don't have the urge. I know the land, but you know the peoples. Go to 'em, Ned. Talk to 'em, show 'em. You have to come with me. No. It's not my time. I'll stop. I'll stop the teachin's, I'll stop the writing, the letters... You know that's not right. And that ain't what none of us wants. I don't wanna leave, Mama. I don't want us to separate. I know. But it has to be. I knew the day would come. You know, I never did tell you, but the first time you ever read to us, I knew that you was the one. I won't hold you back, Ned. I won't hold you back. Mama. Mama. Mama. Make me proud. Make me proud. Mama... Keep them for me. Make sure they get to Ohio the same time we do. ♪♪ I didn't hear from Ned for a whole year. I guess that was about '75 or '76, the same year I first saw Joe Pittman. I had him over to supper, and we started seein' each other from time to tim, and as things happen betweens people, one thing led to another. "But after a time, there were too many and no jobs, and people started freezin' to death of cold. Others got starvin'. Then the protest riots came, and people started goin' off to other states. I am still goin' to school, college, now. When I'm ready, I'm comin' back home. In the meantime, here's three dollars... And God bless you, Mama. "All my love, Ned." Well, little mama... Took a whole year, but you finally heard from your boy. Ever tell him about us? When you gonna tell him about the Clyde Ranch? Ain't said I gonna go yet. Oh, you goin'. That's all there is to it. I'm leavin', and you're goin' with me. Well, how's Ned gonna know where to write to me? Well, we'll send him a photograph of us up on a horse Wild West style. I ain't gettin' on no horse or nothin'. Yeah, you're comin' with me, little mama. By then, Colonel Dye was so forgetful, he'd call us all out to him, and then he couldn't remembr what we was there for. What you all doin' standin' and starin'? Go get on back to work. Colonel, we're leavin'. You what? Jane and me are goin'. What's the matter, Joe? Ain't I treatin' you right? It ain't that at all, Colonel. We've been treated very good here, but I wanna go out and do a little sharecroppin' on my own. Listen, Joe, I'll, uh, turn over that piece of good bottom land to you. You can work it like you want. Joe, you a good man. I need you around here. Ain't much happened since the war, and there ain't another nigger on this place can work a horse like you. You peoples the happiest damn creatures on God's green earth. I wanna do right by y'all. Mighty grateful, Colonel. Mighty grateful. But Jane and me, we... We wanna go off on our own. You ain't grateful. Hell... You wanna sharecrop, sharecrop! See what I care! Thank you, sir. Just a minute. Ain't you forgettin' somethin'? Where my 50 dollars? What 50 dollars? Oh, you forgot that, did ya? Well, I ain't. That 50 dollars to get y'all out of that trouble with the Kluxes. Ain't bothered me. 'Course they ain't. Y'all mixed up in a little politics there after the war. Everybody 'round here knew it. I didn't know you paid. Them Kluxes don't stop doin' what they do just 'cause y'all say, "Hold it." Now, you pay up... or else. We had to sell everything we owned. A dollar for the chair, five for the whole. Shotgun got seven dollars. Finally, Joe did what he had to do. He sold his beautiful horse, the one he trained special, the one he rode so proud. Well? Here's the money, Colonel. I'll count it out, so as you're sure it's all there. It all there. You're a smart one, ain't ya? Well, I got news. Time elapsed come to five more dollars. You didn't say nothin' about that. Joe, we ain't got no more. I got legal rights, my interest. Now, what are you doing, Jane? That's your wedding ring. That's our freedom. ♪♪ It took 10 days of hard walkin' 'til we reached East Texas and the Clyde Ranch. ♪♪ Joe was chief breaker. Everybody called him "Chief Pittman". They'd bring horses in from Texas, and he'd ride the ones nobody else could. Oh, he was a poet, the way he rode. Get him in there! Come on! Get him in there!

The rodeo went on as always, but before it started... ...they tolled the bell for Joe Pittman. When Joe Pittman was killed, part of me went with him to his grave. No man would ever take the place of Joe Pittman, and that's why I carry his name to this day. I've known two or three other mens, but none took the place of Joe Pittman. I let 'em knew that from the very start. Have I got to the part about Albert Cluveau yet? No, ma'am. Or Ned, when he come back that time from Cuba? Not yet, Jane. Oh... I thought I did. It was... I was takin' in laundry then. It was about the turn of the century. I... I was fishin' that day on my place at False River when I... I saw him comin' 'round the bend. It was 20 years since I'd seen him, but I knew that was my Ned the moment I laid eyes on him. Yes, I did. ♪♪ Put me down. I'm gettin' mad, 'cause I'm full. Well, I made some of my favorite puddin'.

So, anyway... we... we got used to, um, small shot whizzin' around us, but when one of those big ones hit, oh, we sometimes found ourselves in a lively dispute over the proprietorship of the nearest tree. Now, don't go talkin' like you spent the whole Spanish-American War hidin' behind a tree. Tell her what the newspaper said. You get your name in the newspapers? Oh, no, no. Not me personally, Mama. But I guess folks by now know about the 10th Cavalry. Miss Jane, that newspaper in Washington said that the roughriders would've never made it up San Juan Hill if it hadn't been for the black soldiers fightin' beside 'em. Uh, uh, ahead of 'em sometimes. And you didn't get hit in all that shootin'? No. Never. I saw men dead and dyin' all around me, black, white, Spanish. I began to feel like, you know, I was alive for a reason. Come back to teach? I checked around, Mama. You don't... You don't have a school on the river. Well... Ain't nothin' changed here either. He hasn't stopped talkin' about how much he has to do, Miss Jane. He can get that way. Yeah. We're both so pleased. You know, I know my Ned can accomplish a great deal here. Made up your mind, ain't you, Ned? That war in Cuba taught me a lot of things, Mama. Well... Ned, I want to tell ya, if you're fixin' to use Elder Thomas' church, he ain't gonna let ya. I know that it is hard for you to come here and discouraging when so many said they would come and didn't. But we must not give up. We are not alone. Listen to what Mr. Frederick Douglass wrote to us from the North, 50 years ago. "Remember that we are one, that our cause is one, and that we must help one another if we would succeed. We have drunk to the dregs the bitter cup of... of slavery. We have worn a heavy yoke, we have sighed beneath our bonds, we have writhed to the bloody lash. Cruel mementoes of our oneness "are indelibly marked in our living flesh." And that's where Albert Cluveau come in. He was a Cajun. He already killed 12 people, black and white.

These are my people, this is my home. Now, they're not afraid! They came to listen, and I'm gonna speak. Ned... You got some black men who will tell you that the white man's the worst thing on the earth. But let me tell you this... all men are the same. The same evil you see in whites you see in blacks, and likewise the good to be found is in all men, white and black. The enemy is not skin. It's ignorance. It was ignorance that put us here in the first place. Ignorance because the big tribes of Africa warred against each other, or made slaves out of the smaller tribes. Our own black people put us in pens like hogs, destroying entire civilizations with rum and beads. And it was still the African, this time the Arabs, who sold us on the block. The white man didn't need guns, because we were weak. The French, the Spanish, the Portuguese, they took us because we were ignorant. We were apart from one another. You got folks here sayin', "Let's go back to Africa." "Let's go to Liberia." Well, I am not African. I'm American. A black American, and proud of it. Look inside yourself, say, "What am I?" "What else besides this... This black skin?" Do you know what a nigger is? First, a nigger feels below anything else on this earth. He doesn't care about himself. He doesn't care about anybody else. He doesn't care about anything. Now, he'll never be an American, and he'll never be a citizen of any other nation. But there's a big difference between a black American... and a nigger. A black American cares, and he knows, and he struggles. That's why I'm telling you this. That's why I know that no son or daughter of mine will ever be a nigger.

I was too old to play, so they stuck a cap on me from my favorite team, the Brooklyn Dodgers, and they made me the ump. I don't mind tellin' you, I was too old. I was half-blind, really, for them calls. Out! But they made no real mind, 'cause nobody played real well anyway. I say you're out! You're out! I'm the ump! Out! Come on, let's play ball, everyone. Oh, yeah, we sure had some fun. People's always lookin' for somebody to lead 'em. They did it durin' slavery, they did it durin' the wa, and they're doin' it now.

Unc Gilly used to show us al how Schmeling fell when Joe Louis hit him. Oh, he was famous for that. Old as he was. And years later, that's how he died, showin' folks how Schmelig fell when Joe hit him. Peoples in the quarters was takin' notice of Jimm, how he recitin' numbers and- and like school.

Shut up and listen to what Jimmy got to say. Well, some people are thinkin' of carrying guns. But we don't want anything to do with that nonsense. Others wanna carry flags. Well, what's a flag if you haven't got any meaning behind it? All we have is our strength, the strength of our people, that's what gives us meaning. We need your strength, we need your prayers. We need you to stand with us, because we have no other roots. Jimmy, I don't want no trouble for my people. What you see here is all we are, nothing more than that.

When Lena had her baby, we all look at him and as, "Is you the one, Jimmy? Is you the one?" 'Course... Yes? I have a telephone call for ya. - Comin' in from New York City. - Okay. Hello. Hello, Quentin. - Yes, sir. - I'm pulling you. You get to cover the John Glenn story in two days. Look, I know this space shot is a big thing, but this woman is... Well, she's not exactly another human interest story. Look, Quentin, I'm sure she's fascinating, but a magazine this size can't survive on a story about an old woma. Now, I need someone to cover that blast off, dammit. Now, if you can't go, then, I'll send someone els. Quentin? Quentin, are you there? All right. All right, what? I'll be there.

You think I'm crazy? Ma'am? I talk to this tree, you know? Ol' sister Oak. Look at me. I'm more than 110 years old. Now, if it ain't the Lord that's keepin' me going, what is it? See? I can sit in the sun, and I can walk. Not like I used to, but I do pretty well. Sometimes, when I feel very good, I walk all the way down to the road, and I looks at the river. Generally, though, I just come up the quarters a piece, and I sit here under this old oak. Look, the peoples done fixed me a nice clean place to sit and talk with my God. Or sometimes I'll sit here for an hour, just thankin' Him for His blessin'. And then I go back home. There's only just a few of us left, you know? And I have seen... enough years to last two lifetimes. I don't mind seein' a few more, though. He'll know when to call me. And when He call me, I'll be ready. 'Til then, I'll just have some of the children read me the Bible and the sports page and... And the funnies. I like the funnies, too, you know? And I do enjoy my vanilla ice cream. I have my vanilla ice cream. I like that. You know, this oak tree I'm sure has been here as long as this place been here. And I ain't ashamed to tell ya that I talk to it. And I ain't crazy, either. It ain't... It ain't necessary craziness to talk to the rivers and the trees. Of course, now, when you talk to the teches in the bayous, that's different, because a teche ain't nothin', and a bayou ain't much more. But, oh, the rivers and the trees... Unless'n, of course, you talk to a china ball tree. Anybody get caught talkin' to a china ball tree or a thorn tree, they got to be crazy. But an old oak, like this one here, that's been here all these years and knows more than you'll ever know, it ain't craziness, son. It's just the nobility you respects.

Nobody knows. Somebody knows. Well, I don't know nothin' about it. Y'all go on back now. I'm going to Bayonne. What you think you gonna find there, 'cept trouble, Miss Jane? You're too old for that. Jimmy. Didn't you just hear me say he'd been shot? He ain't dead nor nothin'. There's only a piece of him dead. The rest of him is waitin' there for us in Bayonne and I'm goin'. Miss Jane, you've been on my place long as I can remember. You've been part of my family, you raised me and both my boys. But I'm tellin' you, you ain't goin' to Bayonne today. Is you gonna tell me now that I have to leave your place? Those folks ain't your problem. Mr. Robert, the other day they throwed a girl in jail for tryin' to drink from the fountain. Today they killed my Jimmy, and I say I'm goin'. Bayonne was the scene of more violence today.
