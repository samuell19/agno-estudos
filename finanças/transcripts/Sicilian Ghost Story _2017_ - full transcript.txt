Giuseppe! Giuseppe! Idiot! It's not for you. My name's on it! Are you the only Giuseppe? So there's another Giuseppe you were secretly following? I wasn't following you, I was going home. This way? This doesn't go anywhere near your house! Give it back. If you tell me who the lucky Giuseppe is! You don't know him. Impossible! I know everyone in the village. He's not from here! I get it! Peppe Pugliese! The cheesemaker! And so? At least he's not an idiot like you. Come on, I'll take you. I want to see Peppe's face when you give him it! You're not funny. Come on, let's go... You can tear it up! Will I give it to him? Come on! Don't be such a sissy! I'll give you it back. Keep staring at it. Ready? What will you do about your bag? I'll come tomorrow after school and see what's left. Aren't you afraid to go back there? Why? Aren't we going back together? Yeah, sure. Here. Even though after that heroic rescue, I really deserve it. A little kiss at least... I can't! The cheesemaker's really jealous! See you tomorrow at school. Wait! Get on. You can't ride this! Yes, I can. Get on! You're not 14. I'll show you, I'm good at it! But do your parents know? What do you think? My grandfather gave me it for my birthday. Your mother doesn't mind? No, I promised to drive slowly. What it you get caught by the cops? Oh, stop all these girly questions and get on! My mum doesn't want me to hang out with you. Don't be afraid. Thanks for bringing me here. Do you want to try? Maybe next time. Next time. Giuseppe! Pegasus was a winged horse. Look at the shape of the constellation... All I see are four stars. When you look carefully, you'll see it. You're not going to regret this, are you? No way. You realise how you've behaved, don't you? You come out of school and disappear. I had to do some research on horses and I went to the stables. Really... You couldn't do your research with the horses in the village? Do you really believe this nonsense about doing research? It's the truth, Mum. You think I don't know who you were with? And it certainly wasn't homework you were doing. And till this time as well... Leave me alone. Come on, Saveria, that's enough. Let's eat something. With the insulin I can't... You eat! There's pasta in the fridge. Try to get it into your head... we've got nothing to do with those people. Everyone in the village saw you. Hanging on to him on that scooter... A school friend like any other. Enjoy your meal. What lovely little pages about your knight... He doesn't seem like just another school friend. Your writing and drawing are lovely. You mustn't touch my stuff! But not even a couple of lines about his father, not even a picture. How come? He's an interesting subject. What, don't you know where he is? What's Giuseppe got to do with his father? You, my girl, you just need to concentrate on studying. Don't make the same mistake as me... At my age, I'm not planning on marrying anyone, but who I see is my business! Did love triumph? Or your usual cowardice? Mission... accomplished... Something... weird happened... Maybe he felt sick and someone took him home. Today he's still not well, and that's why he's not at school. And he left me there, without saying anything? Males! Hypocrites, takes and traitors. Trust me, I've got three brothers. Three masterpieces. Yesterday was so magical, Lori. Was there a kiss? Did he kiss you or did you kiss him? Whoever did whatever, they did it. Anyway, I've figured out why he vanished after the kiss. - Why? - He must have read the letter! What do you mean? Jeez, it was mushy! And the drawings on the envelope... Gave me the shivers! Some friend. But what have you got in common? Nada de nada! Three things in his head : horses, football and videogames! You don't know him. He's really clever and he makes me laugh... Watch! Catch someone in the face with those tits, you'll kill them! Good morning! Is Giuseppe at home? Conigliaro, would you like to help your companion who is obviously in a state of confusion? Miss, Giuseppe hasn't been to school for 17 days. Is he sick? His family told the headmaster that Giuseppe won't be coming to school for a while. Why not? I don't know. Something must've happened to him. We'd have heard, wouldn't we? We're his classmates and we want to know why he's not here. Concentrate on studying, so when Giuseppe comes back, we can all help him catch up. When's he coming back? Stop mucking about, you. We don't know. Maybe we could go and see him. Only you could have found me. Don't be scared. I'm with you. Good morning. I came to give this to Giuseppe. Why isn't he coming to school? Has he gone to see his father? What's going on? Can I come in? Get in! Giuseppe's not well and can't see anyone! I'll keep my distance, he won't infect me. You'll see him when he comes back to school. Giuseppe! That's enough now! And don't show your face round here again! Tomorrow I'll be back! Giuseppe! Giuseppe! My boy! Mum! Mum, where are you? Mum, help me! Please! How many times do I need to tell you? While I'm in here, I want to be left in peace. Somethings happened to Giuseppe, I'm certain! Calm down. Wait for me in your room and we can discuss this. Promise me we'll do something. Hello...? Giuseppe! Put your father on. He's not in, you'll find him at dinnertime. I've been looking for him all day. Who is this? Giuseppe! Don't worry, we'll deal with her. There's another car that will take her home. Are you pleased we're taking you to see your father? Crouch down... Where your father is staying is a secret. We need to be sure no-one sees you with us. Your father is collaborating with the police and has denounced all these Mafia friends of his, those pieces of shit and murderers. Is that why we haven't heard from him? If you're a snitch, you have to forget your family. Lots of your father's ex-comrades would like to see your father in a nice coffin for what he's doing. He's not scared of them! What about you? Where's my father? Put this on. You mustn't know where we are either. For your safety, as well as his. Let's go. Get him out. Dad? Your father is a real piece of shit! If he doesn't stop talking to the cops, you're not going home alive. Take this! Let's see it your father and grandfather are interested in you. Hold it up higher. Higher! A lovely smile, come on. Don't make a sound or I'll kill you. Help! Dad's here, love... Dad's here... What was it, the usual nightmare? You have to be patient, Luna. The police and Carabinieri are looking for him. They'll do all they can to bring him home. Look, it's a beautiful day! It feels like summer! The air is so clear! Get ready, Miss. I've got a sore tummy... I had bad cramps during the night. Do you want to stay home? No! Another day off? Has school become an optional? These sore tummies... What are we going to do? You've got your exams this year. This way, they won't even let you sit them... That's all you care about. All right, stay home. I'll come and get you later and we can go to the doctor. And we'll get a nice ice cream. Lemon for you, because you're not well and chocolate for me. This is your last day off, though. She can phone and get her homework. There's no need, Loredana's coming this afternoon. That's fine, then. That's fine, then. That great donkey, she's already failed twice. The Nobel Prize you'll both get. In donkey-ology and confusion. You're right. Poisoned mice aren't good for you... My turn now. You don't need to do it as well. But it was my idea! Your father will kill you! His appreciation yesterday. I was busy with my homework and forgot to milk the goats. Never mind. I'll be enough. One more slap's not going to change my life. I'm not letting you do this alone. Come on! Phase one. Decolouration. Get off your arse and shampoo me! You don't think there are better ways to play the rebel? Who are you trying to impress? Not me, I hope. Or maybe it's to make Daddy happy? Well? "Giuseppe has vanished, and what are you doing?" Good question. Let's try and answer it. Giuseppe has vanished and you... ...stop studying... ...you get failed. Giuseppe has vanished and you... ...dye your hair. At least I'm doing something. And what does it achieve? Now your hair's blue, is Giuseppe coming back? Come on... You're more intelligent than that. So I should pretend nothing's happened? Like everyone else? Life goes on, doesn't it? Why not? Is that not how it is? You know as well that you're growing up. Maybe we know the people who kidnapped him. Maybe they're here in the village! We need to rebel against this, all of us. - Until he's found! - Whatever... Luna... ...try to think... He's my life! Do you understand what that means? Thinking about him all the time, always asking yourself where he is. If he's alive, if he's dead. Hearing his voice in your head, do you understand what that means? Knowing he needs help and not being able to do anything for him. Crying yourself to sleep every night. Feeling sick at the idea of going to school and not finding him there. Do you understand what it means? I can't help thinking about him. And I don't want not to. These equations are fairly easy. I want to be nice to you this morning. You've got an hour. Get out of that chair. It's not yours. Miss, it's written too small, I can't read it from the last row. OK, Lombardi, copy the exercises. - Then go back to your place. - I told you to move. Right now! Miss, Conigliaro is hassling me. Conigliaro, please. Go and sit down. - Miss... - I don't understand why I can't sit here if the place is free. You know what? From today this is my place. - Conigliaro! - Look at this loony... All she needed was blue hair! My hair can be sorted with a shampoo. What's the cure for your fucking face? Whatever... I'm here and here I'm staying. Because the snitch's son won't be coming back to school. Lombardi! You happy now? Don't be an idiot... No! Giuseppe... I'm writing to you from my room. I spend most of my time in my room. Only who I say can come in and I do whatever I like. I draw and write all the time. What do you like apart from horses? The first time I wrote your name in my diary was at school when I realised you were sad. I thought how someone like you could never be sad. I asked you why. And you teased me. "Luna, you're imagining things that don't exist," you said. Then at home I heard my mother talking about your father and I understood why you were sad. The second time was when you invited me to the beach. But my mother wouldn't let me go. That day it was my turn to be sad, I really wanted to go to the beach with you. I listened to the radio all day long in my room... and, without realising, I started dreaming... ...imagining things that don't exist, like you say... ...but for me if you dream something it means it might exist... Just for a bit of variety. You're a little man now. When you finish eating, write to that cocksucker of your father that we're treating you well, but we're starting to lose patience. Why, did Grandfather not get the other letters? Of course he did. So why write any more? If Dad keeps talking with the cops, it means he doesn't give a fuck about me. How could that be? If that were the case, he'd already have stopped being a snitch... If I'm still here, it means that you've decided I'm not going back home. I'm not writing any more! I'll come and get it later. Luna, I don't know if I'll ever come back. I want to cry, but I'm not going to in front of this lot. I wish I could dream like you... ...but I can't here... Your father mustn't drink that. You don't need to repeat it every time. With you two, I do. Right, that's me finished. I'll have a shave and we can go. Will you light the stove in the sauna before you go? The sauna? In this heat? It gets rid of the toxins, It gets rid of the toxins, it's purifying. Stewed apples! You eat one as well, it's good for your stomach. It's good for your stomach. I wouldn’t even give these to the dogs. We should come here more often. You say the same thing every time. What peace and quiet... What peace and quiet... It's been a difficult year, especially for you... But at last it's behind you. You did well. You did well. Despite me and your mum and everyone else... ...you passed your exams. And now secondary school in the city, new classmates, new friends... a new life! New friends... a new life! You know you're the most important thing in my life, don't you? I know, Dad. Can you pass it to me? Digestion's started! Now what would you say to trying to catch a few nice eels? Now what would you say to trying to catch a few nice eels? Here. Meanwhile... I've something to do... Leave me alone! Let...me go! Let...me go! - Luna! - Let me go! - Luna! - Leave me alone! Have you got a son? I don't care if you tease me. If I don't give you this letter, I'll never be able to do anything, or rather I'll end up only doing things I don't care about. or rather I'll end up only doing things I don't care about. I'm not exaggerating. I lock myself in my room and dream. I go to school and I don't understand anything because I'm dreaming. When I have to go somewhere, I get lost because I'm dreaming. I get lost because I'm dreaming. When there's a storm, I sit and look out the window and dream. Instead when the sun dazzles me, I close my eyes and dream all the same. When I'm sad, I dream, and when I'm happy it's because I dream. Loredana has noticed too and says I'm going daft. The positive thing is that my mother's voice goes in one ear and out the other because I keep dreaming. But I can't keep going like this, because thanks to dreaming alone all the time, I really will become a fool. Only you can help me because what I dream of is you. I dream of you at every moment. Day and night. I dream of you at every moment. Day and night. I'm in this dream as well. So to solve this problem you have to answer this very simple question: Giuseppe, do you want to get together? If you say no, I'll stop dreaming. I admit it, I'll cry, that's normal. Maybe we could stay friends, that way, instead of copying my homework, I could help you do it. If you say yes, I'll dream the things I've dreamt with you, but it won't be a dream any more, but the most beautiful thing in the world, us two together. If we get together, I'll still help you with your homework, and you can teach me to ride horses! Let me out of here! Open up! I want to get out of here! Let me out of here! He's small but troublesome, Puppy Dog! You're nothing but cowards! When's the new kennel going to be ready? He can't stay here any longer. Watch, he bites! You know what they say in Russia? What? That every time there's a moment of silence, a cop is born. In Russia. Here, it's a Mafioso that's born. I've got nothing to tell you. You can imagine what hospital was like. Stuffed with pills... Tell me about you, come on, otherwise another Mafioso will be born-. Well, there is a bit of news... You sure you want to know? What is it, then? I beat my father and my brothers. Bye-bye, cheese and ricotta... I'm going to secondary school! In the city! Can you imagine? Loredana the cheesemaker at secondary! And do you like it? I don't know. But something good has already come of it... Hold tight... I've got a boyfriend! No, it's not a joke. Is he hot? Hot? The word hot does not render the idea. He is literally superhot. A force of nature. A cyclone! Has he got a name, this superhot cyclone? Calogero... and he likes music. Rap. We sing together! His cousin Nino writes the lyrics. His cousin's nice as well. You must meet them! I hate rap. OK, but who cares? Saturday we could do something together. Loredana's right. Go and enjoy yourselves, love. Also because, when we go away, you won't get to see each other that often, love! Don't pay any attention. She's been like that for a while... She became affectionate. It happens, even to Swiss mothers. "When we go away"? Will you tell me what that means? They say it's not good for me to stay here, that I need a change of air. Which means...? My mother is on the phone to her brother every day in Bümpliz. I think they're going to take me there. When were you planning on saying? The sea... I can smell the sea! I want to see it! I want to see the sea! I want to see the sea! Never tell anyone. I promise! Can you see the sea? But I can smell it. Sure, in your head! In mine at least there is the sea. I recognised your voice... ...you were a friend of my dad's. That's why you never said anything. If you ever want to get home... I won't tell anyone. We need to go. I won't tie it too tight... Shit, that is so wild...so wild! A guy with a face like a pig... I first saw him in front of Giuseppe's house, then in the house in the woods... So just in your nightmares? They're not nightmares! What are they, then? We have to go that way. Oh, what are you two doing? Get a move on! Well? What do you think? So long as you like him. You can say that again. Nice vest. You like it? Especially with this cold. Cold, hot, ice, sun, like you teach us, little one, it's all in our heads! If you didn't rap when you're speaking to me, I'd really appreciate it. Friendly... What are you looking for? A house. The house under construction I saw the night I nearly drowned. When you tried to kill yourself, you mean? If you don't want to follow us, as far as I'm concerned, your presence isn't exactly essential. The house didn't have planning permission, right? I wouldn't know. I think so. It was ugly, that's for sure. It makes me sad as well. But to kill yourself for that? I don't know... Cousin, that wasn't the reason... Imagine if there was a suicide for every home without planning permission. Where we're from, humanity would be reduced to hardly anything. Nature would prevail again, the rivers and lakes would be clean once more, trees would grow everywhere, human ruins would be covered with vegetation and our island would again belong to the gods who once lived here numerous the nymphs ran around in the woods and Pan's flute rang out. I'd like to hear that... I think about it all the time. The house was there. And now it's vanished. Nature, like Nino says, has won again. Luna... I hid here and then went in. One thing matches... ...the water. You're right... Lots of water. This puddle, the cistern beneath the trapdoor... They're not coincidences. Stop! Stop right now! What is it? It was him, Loredana! Him who? Pigface! It was him, I tell you, it's the same car! Luna, calm down... We have to report this! Let's go home. The woods was already a really bad idea. Get on. Let's go home, please. I know what you're thinking. Listen to me... You can go... I'm not leaving you here, that's for sure. You need to follow him! And he'll take us straight to Giuseppe? Yes! Well, maybe not to Giuseppe, but to those who were involved in his kidnap, for sure! Of course, because we're all idiots? You said it! Put Giuseppe's house under surveillance and find Pigface! Giuseppe's grandfather meets him... Luna! They'll have tried to resolve the situation among themselves! Mrs Conigliaro, can you tell me what's going on? Your daughter's a bit over the top... You have to excuse her, sir... My daughter... was recently hospitalised... Come on, let's go home. Dad, you know him! He was there at the marble factory we went to. Love, what nonsense are you saying? Let's not waste the officer's time. He's already been very patient. I'm not talking nonsense! - My husband and I are mortified... - Leave me alone! - But as you can see... - Leave me alone! My daughter's not well... - Leave me alone! - Luna... You're a scumbag just like everyone else! Why did you call them? Why? Puppy Dog has totally shat himself! What'll we do? What d'you think? We'll clean him up. This is not for me. This is not a job for me... Look! Look! One, two, three! Why not call Loredana and ask her to come round? Yeah, you should call her. ...There was a continent affectionately known as Old Europe, and in this Europe there was a little peninsula in the shape of a boot called... yes, Italy. In the middle of this Italy there was a tiny, small village... We're leaving tomorrow and you're not even going to say goodbye? It's important. I don't want to do this... I don't want to do this... Come here! I don't want to! Come here! Giuseppe! Giuseppe! Giuseppe! I knew you wouldn't abandon me! I'll never leave you again... ...never again. You mustn't come with me. Hug me. Luna, don't fall asleep. Face the wall. Luna, don't fall asleep. I'm coming! Open up! Loredana! Come here! What's going on? Out the way! Come on! To Giuseppe Di Matteo (1981-1996), the boy kidnapped by the Mafia, held prisoner for 779 days, strangled and then dissolved in acid.
