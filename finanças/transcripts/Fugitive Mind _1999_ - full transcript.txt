My God. Hey, Dave, how's it going? Hey, babe. Hi, hon. How's your headache? It's great. What's cooking. I thought I'd make kind of light vegetable thing tonight because I think I gained five pounds last week. Five pounds, where? I got the pictures back. They're over there. Great. Next time we're going camping. I thought we were camping out. We didn't order room service once. Look out, Davy Crockett, here comes Miss Wilderness. OK, next time you stay in the tend and I'll going to the Ritz. Baby, you know what, you don't even know what you're missing. It's great exercise living off the land. And every night before you fall asleep under the stars, you have this great satisfaction of knowing you provided for yourself. The satisfaction I can easily do without. How did I ever end up with such a city slicker I don't know. Well, you did. Well, I did. So go get washed up, nature boy, the kill of the day is going to be ready in 10 minutes. A little more salt and pepper. For the past six years, Senator John Davis has done nothing except take undue credit for a positive economy, which he had nothing to do with. Now, ask yourself this, what exactly did senator Davis do with all the time the people of California gave to him? By my count, nothing. I believe in judging candidates not only for what they do, but for what they don't do. My name is Mark Putnam, and I would like to be California's next United States senator. Well, there you have it. That's how we're getting licked in the polls. I wouldn't worry too much. We're only down three points, and I have an idea. I can tell by looking at this guy that there's something in his past that we can glom onto. Jimmy, I don't want to get into a mud slinging match here. What then? This campaign's coming up on us in no time, and I don't want to have to play catch up. Now, I said, we spend some money and throw it right back at him. That's not what people want. In a way that cupcake is right. The people want the action. They want lower taxes and better incentive programs. The last thing they want is state and federal subsidies going to private companies. Here we go again. Why don't we get rid of big business completely. Of course, we wouldn't be able to run a campaign because there wouldn't be any money. There has to be some compromise somewhere. I'm not talking about all big business, but a well-chosen battle fought for the right reasons. It'll cost us. Well, like you said, there's going to be some compromise. God. My God, you're drenched. Honey, it's OK. I hate this. What's wrong? I don't know. What is it that you see? Tell me. I don't know. Hey, Tony. Robert. How ya doing? How ya doing? Marty says you guys are having some problems with the sonic system. What's the problem? Damn PID keeps misidentifying personnel and tripping the alarm without warning. Do you think you can fix it? That's exactly my expertise, but I'll see what I can do? Excuse me, Mr. Robert Dean? Yeah. Hello, I'm Dr. Thomas Grace, head of the company health department. Now you had your employee physical last week. Is that correct? Yeah, last Friday. Is there a problem? No, no, no, nothing serious. No, we just noticed some irregularities in your blood tests. We'd like you to come to the infirmary for a followup examination. Um... how about this afternoon around about 4:00? Yeah, that's fine. Good, 4:00 it is. Don't forget to cough. Are you experiencing any chest pain? No. All right. You can get dressed. We're going to reprocess your blood work. These things get contaminated very easily. And I really don't think there's anything to worry about. That's good news. It says here you don't smoke or drink. No. How's your appetite? Eating well? Yeah, very well. And sleeping? Yeah. Have you or have you not been sleeping? I can't tell you the last time I had a good night's sleep. But that's no big deal, right? Sleep is the best thing we can do for our bodies, Robert. It recharges the batteries. Insomnia is more common than you think, you know. But there are ways of alleviating stress, revitalizing our sleep patterns. I wouldn't say I have insomnia. What then? Physical discomfort? Aches and pain? Dreams? Dreams. Dreams, OK, well dreams are very interesting, Robert. They're a window into our subconscious. Most people underestimate their importance. Do you mind telling you something about yours? Well, I don't know. They're not exactly clear. I mean, the feeling's clear. I can't explain it. OK, well, I don't think there's anything to worry about. But I want you to check in with me later this week so I can monitor your condition. And I want to give you some sleeping pills, help you get some rest. Well, you're the doc. Well, I'd say your first few years have been a great success. Both Doctor Fordham and Doctor Grace have given you high praise. Your research is unmatched. Which is why I'd like to offer you a greater responsibility. Well, what do you think of that? Thank you. That's good enough for me. Dr. Fordham will fill you in with all the details. Congratulations. Proud of you. Get to work. Yes, sir. How are you doing tonight, Dr. Foley? What? Um... fine, OK, hanging in there. Just barely from what I can see. It looks like you could use a day off. Yeah. I wish. There you go. Don't work too hard. I'm hardly working. Let go. Let's me go. No! Let me go. No! Stop it! No! Come on. Come on. Come on. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up. What's going on? - Don't. Robert, what the hell is going on? You're scaring me. You're scaring me too. Just give me a minute. Robert? Let me in. I want to help. Robert. Just a second. Don't scare me like that. Sorry. I don't know what's going on. I'm scared too. I want you to get help. Go talk to that doctor again tomorrow and tell him what's happening. What did you just say? Nothing. What? How did you know I went to a doctor? What? You just told me I went to a doctor. I never told you about him. Yeah you did. In your sleep. In my sleep? And you never mentioned it? What's going on, Robyn? I didn't want to frighten you. Frighten me? Look at me now. Robyn, I saw you in my dream. You were wearing a lab coat. Robert, you need help. OK, I swear to you, you told me. Now let me go. You're hurting me. Yeah, you better send someone. It's urgent. Yeah, right around the corner. Now. Who was that? Wrong number. Robyn, that phone never rang. Honey, I don't know what's wrong. And I'm just trying to help. Who are those guys? Who are they? They're here to help you. He went through there. Hey, take it easy, buddy. We don't want to hurt you. Physically, he's adjusting fine. Previous abnormalities are dormant due to the altered mental state. He did express some trouble sleeping. And he described nocturnal episodes, which could represent gaps in the program. Is there any chance he could break through? Well, this is a prototype. But the imprint is still the primary occupant. And even if he experienced a complete vision, he has no reference to substantiate it. Well, it's hard to believe it's come down to this. Are you sure there's no other way? I think we've had this conversation before. You said it yourself. Our research is vital to future generations, not to mention our own sacrifices, all the time and money. It doesn't make it easy, does it? Seeing the problems that our subject is having, it makes me wonder if fate is not trying to tell us something. That's funny. Since when does a man of science take the time to acknowledge fate? Keep an eye on him. Dave. Dave. Turn out the lights. - Who's there? It's me, Robert. Can you please turn out the lights? Just turn them off. Dave, I need your help. They're after me. Can I come in? Whoa, whoa, who's after you? Just let me in. I got two kids in there trying to sleep. I don't appreciate you coming out here in the middle of the night. Dave, there's some guys out here. They're after me. Please. Listen, I'd like to help. But it's late. What? I don't mean to be rude, but I don't want to get involved. Dave, I wouldn't be doing this if it wasn't serious, please. It's OK. Your wife told us. Told you what? About your condition, your past. Past? What past? What did she tell you? When you moved in last week, she came over and told us about your... Wait, wait, wait, last week? Yeah. A week? Dave, I lived in that house for six years. You've been my neighbor for over four. I helped you move your refrigerator. Remember? Do you remember, for Christ's sake, please? All right, you better go before I call the cops. No, please, Dave, you got to remember, please. Look, all I know is you moved in last week. I've never seen you before that in my life. I think you better go. Hey, what can I get you? Enjoy the straw. The samples, I got them. So? They have the same DNA structure, but a slightly different genetic base. What does that mean? It's proof. Plus the stuff I told you before, about what I heard. I can't use this stuff. It'll take weeks to run more tests and verify everything. I need something more concrete. Like what? Well, like who are these people are, where they came from. That's the kind of stuff I need. You know, my ass is already on the line here, OK? And I'm pretty sure that they're following me. Gardner, I'm scared, all right. Look, you agreed to help us, right? You realize it's the right thing to do. If you don't give me something I can use, you might as well forget the whole thing. What do you want me to do? What I want you to do is go back in there and start digging and keep digging until you find something I can use. I'll hold onto this in the meantime. Hair? He gives me hair. He broke the program. That is impossible. Something must have set him off. What did you do? He caught me off guard. Precisely. This wouldn't have happened if he weren't having those visions. He knows that something is wrong. Please, blaming each other does us no good at this point. Where is he? My men are still looking for him. When they find him, they've got instructions to take them to the lab. Good. The sooner the better. Who are you? It's time to get dressed. We're going to go for a walk. We're going to get some exercise. Number 734 is ready. Do you need any assistance? Yes, I need help with the escort. Roger. Thank you. Come on, honey, one foot in front of the other. What's she doing? Get up. Get up. She's getting away. Shit. Over here. Let's look in here. There's something that way, down the stairs. Let's go. Check out front. OK. No, no, I don't want to hear that. I told you no guns. Now you get out there. And you search every inch of the grounds and you find her. What is going on here? We have an escapee. Who? Suzanne Hicks. Knocked out an orderly and a nurse. She's got a key card. All right, lock everything down. I want them posted at every gate. Nobody gets in or out of here unless I say so. You got that? Yes, I have it. Shit. You go that way. I'll check the van. Backtrack to see what way she went. Right. Hey. How you doing? You seen a woman running around here? No, no woman. This you van? Yeah, it's my van. Wait a minute, what are you doing out here so late? Something I forgot to do. Like what? Like this. Howdy. What's the problem? - Nothing serious. I just need to call you in. What's your name? Robert Dean. Yeah, I got Robert Dean here at the back gate. Can you please check for authorization? Big night? Yeah, forgot something in my locker. I hate when that happens. Me too. You know, I don't know what's taking him so long. I'm sorry about that, Mr. Dean. No problem. Hold on a second. I've got to take this inside. Yeah, what's up? Dean's still there, right? Yeah, I got you. You've got to be kidding. Don't let him leave under any circumstances. You serious? All right, all right. Get your hands off the wheel. Now. Tate. Tate. Jesus Christ. Which way did he go? Which way? I don't know. Damn it. Let me take the wheel. Let me drive. I think we need to discuss an alternative. We'll find him. I promise. You're willing to bet your life, your career, everything we've worked for? Enough. Robert Dean is our only choice. Now, we find him. We do what needs to be done or it's over. What about the Hicks lady? How badly can she hurt us? If she can find someone to believe her, she could do us some damage. Tell, Mr. Karns to eliminate her at all costs. All right, good man. Shut up. Shut up. Who are you? OK. I'm going to ask you yes or no questions. And you're going to answer me by nodding your head. OK? Do you understand? OK. Did you bring me here? OK. Um... Did Gen. Com send you? Do you know who I am? Do you know who I am? OK. I'm going take this off. You're not going to scream, OK? You're not going to scream? OK, good. What the hell is going on, John. It's me. I thought you said you knew me. Why are you calling John? Because that's your name. Hey, Gardner, shake a leg. What? What you got? Looks like we've got another one. Robert Dean, age 35, 6 foot, 180. He's kind of cute. Check this out. Call me crazy, but I bet my bra these two are the same guy. It looks like somebody had a real nice make over. Any of the others match? No. We got this guy with the unibrow here, of course. Jug head. And of course, there's little miss hygiene. Is there any correlation? Link? Look, who gets paid to be the detective here. All right, call missing persons, see if any of those names come up, OK? John Rice that was your name before they got you. OK, fine. I'm John. Who the hell are you? I'm Suzanne. You don't remember me? No. I haven't seen you a day in my life. We used to be friends. Then how come I don't recognize you? Look, I don't know what the hell they've done to you, but they've convinced you you're somebody else. Obviously, I'm not who you think I am. Please, you have to try to remember. Look, I'll be the first to admit there's a lot of crazy things going on here. But I know who I am. My name is Robert Dean. I was born in Cleveland, Ohio. I have a younger brother named Gary. And I was named after my father for Christ's sake. You've never even met your father, or your mother. That's probably why they chose you. You know, I don't even know why I'm wasting my time talking to you. I'm getting the hell out of here. No, you have to stay. We can't risk getting caught until we come up with some concrete answers. And we're never going to do that unless we stick together. Yeah. Senator Davis's office. Yeah, can you put me through to Senator Davis, please? May I tell him who's calling? Carl Gardner. One minute, please, Mr. Gardner. It's Carl Gardner on line 1. I'll take it in my office. He'll be right with you, Mr. Gardner. Speak of the devil. I was beginning to think you were going to leave me out in the cold. Well, I've come up with something very interesting for you. I sure as well hope so. Where would you like to meet? Looks like you're really moving up in the world. Well, you said you want to get in touch with the common man. Here they are. What's the news? Well, this ought to get you a headline. They're profiles of four people who are currently being tested in the lab. And one of them, Suzanne Hicks, was reported missing three weeks ago out in New York. None of the other names match up. But my man on the inside swears that these people are being held against their will and experimented on. Will he testify? He's pretty scared right now. But, yeah, I think he'll probably cooperate. He'll want full immunity, though. Done, if it breaks, I'll personally guarantee it. Well there's more. He's got skin grafts, hair follicles, and some other medical crap that he claims is evidence of human cloning. Wow. This is going to be huge. Do you believe it? I don't know. But whatever it is, it doesn't look good. Tell your man to get everything he can in the next day, because after that everything is going to change. And thanks, as always. Senator, you forget something, by bill. Bartender, give me another one of these, please. Well? Jimmy, tomorrow's going to be a beautiful day. There you go. Thanks. Go ahead. OK, we met at a homeless shelter. You were living there, and I worked there. And the first time we talked, we got into a huge argument about government relief programs or something. You had a really big chip on your shoulder from the way the military had mistreated you. But I put you to work and you loosened up. Can't imagine why I'd want to forget that past. No, you were happy. Actually, we were happy. Sounds romantic. It was. Actually, you were really incredible. You designed this whole night outreach program. And, well, that's when it happened. What happened? That we were kidnapped. We used to take 20 meals out to people who couldn't make it to the shelter. And it was really late on a Thursday. And we had one more meal to deliver to this old lady, Lucy, who lived way down on Sixth Street. So we cut down an alley. And then out of nowhere these three guys jumped us. And you fought them off. And then we started running. Let me go. And they chased us into a building. This way. It's got an elevator, John. Get in. John, in the elevator. Come on, over here. John. Move. Go. Go. Go. We got up to the top, and there was no place to go. Suzanne. And I just started running to the edge. Stop. John. No! No! I remember. You died. No, I grabbed onto this ladder. No! They caught me. No, no, let me go, you bastard. And then they got you. I kind of remember your face now. And I remember what you just said. I just can't remember anything else. I just can't. Why can't I remember anything else? I don't know. What's the status? Karns called in an hour ago. He got a tip from a gas station attendant who claims to have seen the van. It's just a matter of time. God, I hope so. We'll increase man power it that's what it takes. Hello. It's me. He's going ahead with everything. And I haven't been able to identify the inside source. That is not acceptable. We're running out of time. I realize that. They're being very careful though. You have to convince him to push it back. Impossible. I have to go. Hello? When you made this for me did you ask me how I like it? No, not that I'd even no... Black with three sugars, because I like a little sugar on the bottom. How did you know to make it like that? I didn't. And let me see yours. Cream, no sugar. Don't you see what this means? It means it's all in here. We just have to find it. Who's this guy? I don't know? Senator Davis? I know this guy. How do you know him? It's the guy that's in my dreams. What happens? There's a crowd of people. There's... there's a bunch of photographers. There... my God. This is Karns. I think we've got him. Are you sure? Yes, we've got him. A sleazy little motel, about 60 miles away. His van's parked out back. We're ready to move in. Just make sure that he's alive. No problem. God, it all makes sense. You were special forces. You assassinated people all over the world, for Christ's sake. And then you were dishonorably discharged. I'm sure Gen. Com sought you out. It's perfect. You have a military background, a rebellious, difficult past. I mean, you fit the profile. They programmed you to kill the senator. Why would anyone want to kill the senator? Those experiments. You should have seen what they were going to do to me. I'm sure Senator Davis found out about him. Who is it? Maid service. Yeah, you can come back tomorrow. It's OK. Sorry, we have to clean the room today. OK, I'll be right there. No, go, go. Get in the bathroom. Shit. Get him into the car. We now have Mr. Dean, and we are bringing him in. We got him. They're on their way back. Now find Dr. Gray, so let him know the situation because we have to work fast. Right away. Someone else was with him. I want you to go get the van, and then I want you two to search the surrounding area. And show this to the clerk. See if he recognizes her. OK. What did you give him? What did I give him? Exactly what you gave us to give him. And we restrained him with the taser initially, but he was out of it pretty quick. Well, let's hope he's not fried. Yes of course, but listen, Doctor, Suzanne Hicks was with him. Now I've got my men over there. They're covering the area. But as of yet, we haven't got her. How are you certain it was her? The motel clerk positively identified her from a photograph. She won't get. How reassure. Come on, let's get him inside. Excuse me, what are you doing here? Um... I was... I was sent for some samples and Dr. Gray sent me. You're not authorized to here. You're going to have to come with me. No, just... I have a pass right... How long is he going to be out. I need to evaluate the degree to which his memory has broken through. He'll be asleep at least five hours. We don't have time to waste. I don't see any alternative. If the data implementation is unsuccessful, you can forget any chance that the program is going to be effective. Come on, I just need a chance to observe him and make sure it holds. I'm closing down the lab. I don't want any surprises. Robyn, look, after tomorrow, it's all going to be over. Then we can get on with our research. Where did you see him? In one of the holding cells. I only caught a glimpse of him, but I'm sure it was him. You're sure that it was this Rice guy, the John Rice. Yes, it was John Rice. I think something major is going down tomorrow. They're locking up the lab. You wouldn't believe some of the stuff I heard them talking. Like what? These, you get these developed, it's everything you dreamed of and more, man. I don't have those kind of dreams. They're doing human cloning, mind manipulation, brainwashing. It's the seventh ring of hell. Anybody see you? I had a little run in with an orderly, but I don't... I don't think anybody saw me. I'm just going to call in sick for the rest of my life, just to be safe. Can I get another one of these, please? That's probably a good idea. You know, you told me that everything was going to be OK. That if we did this everything would be better. But it just feels like everything's falling apart now. Well, hang in there. The next couple of days are going to get very interesting. Lot of stuff going to happen. Thank you. Just keep the coming. Hello. Can you tell me your name? Do you know who I am? No. No. I know what you're doing. I'm going to let... Hold him down. We're trying to help you. All right, let's get him in the tank. We can proceed immediately. How long till we can begin reimplementation? His vitals are stabilized. We can proceed immediately. Dr. Fordham, initiate data program sequencing. Sequencing complete. We're ready to initiate memory imprint. Start imprint in five, four, three, two, one, now. Flat line, we have complete cardiac arrest. Thomas, get him out of there. No, wait. 1,500 CCs. If we can revive him, the program will remain intact. If he dies, it's over. Now, we can't risk that. We don't have a choice. He's stabilizing. Stop the program. Let's get him out of there. Tucker Foley, top-level researcher. I just gave him a promotion, for Christ's sake. Privy to almost all of our operations. I can't believe it. Information is leaking. And there has to be a source. Find Dr. Grace, alert him to the situation. Then get Tucker and find out what he knows. What about Gardner? I saw Tucker hand him something. I don't know. Look, I know it's not my place to say. But you are going to have to make a decision quickly. There is a lot at stake here. I never thought all this was necessary. Truth, advancement of science, society, that was what it was all about. Medical school was supposed to be an escape from politics. I guess I was very naive. Politics can be your friend. You just have to know how to play. And there is nothing naive about that. I need to speak to Senator Davis. Please, let me go. I need to speak to the sen... Senator. Who is that? What's going on? Extra security. We've had some threats. I'll take care of this. What's going on? Please, you have to listen to me. There are people trying to kill the senator. I have proof. The senate is going to be dead unless got of your asses and you do something. Look, Miss, please calm down. How did she get in here? Sorry, sir, we found her sleeping in the senator's office. She must have snuck in last night. She has no ID. She says her name is... Suzanne Hicks. All right, put her in this office over here. And I'll talk to her in a moment. Is that all right with you? - Yes. Hurry. What's that all about? Just some nut job. It's under control. Come on, we've got to work on your speech. She looked familiar. Come on, we've got a campaign to run. Thank heaven you're OK. Where am I? You passed out. The security guards brought you here. I took the liberty of calling your wife. My head hurts. Robert, there's something you have to do. Are you ready? Are you ready? Yes, I'm ready. OK. My name is John Rice, special forces, dishonorable discharge. If you're watching this, it's because I've successfully assassinated Senator John Davis. The assassination of Senator Davis is a pure act of terrorism, done in the name of all those who have served their country in vane. Very good, Robert. You can go home now. Sorry about that. No, it's not you. I'm just a little jumpy right now. Well, why don't you start from the beginning and tell me everything. About three weeks ago my boyfriend John Rice and I were kidnapped. Kidnapped? Man. Son of a bitch. This guy's been set up. It's good to have you home, Robert. It's nice to be home. How do you feel? Is everything OK? I feel fine. Maybe you should take a nap. This has been a tough day for you. Yeah. I'm going to go take a nap. Hello. Hello, Robert, are you ready? Yes, I'm ready. That's very good. There's something I have to do. Senator Davis's headquarters, Morabito speaking. Yeah, would you put me through to the senator, please. It's urgent. He's busy right now. You'll have to speak with me. No, I'm afraid I can't. Look, my name is Carl Gardner, the senator knows me. His life is in danger. You cannot let him make that speech today. Well, I'll pass that information on to the senator. And thank you for your concern. No, you don't understand. I... Hello? Damn. It sounded like a direct hit. Bring the car around. I'm done here. I never thought all of this was necessary. Truth, advancement of science, of society, that's what this was all about. Makes me wonder if fate's not trying to tell us something. That's funny. Sine when does a man of science take the time to acknowledge fate? How do you know they're trying to kill the senator? I know. This sounds crazy, but I think they programmed him or something. Him? John Rice. They have figured out a way to implant this plan into his consciousness. I don't even think he knows he's going to do it. Look, Miss, put yourself in my position. I mean, this does sound a little far fetched to say the least. Well, then check out his history. John Rice, he was a sniper in special forces, dishonorably discharged. He has no job, no home, no family. He's the perfect person to pin this on. I am telling the truth. I know you feel very strongly about this... Look, just tell the senator. Maybe he'll be willing to do something about it. I have already alerted his security team. They are going to be on the lookout. But you have to understand, we get over 100 of these death threats a month. And I cannot tell the senator every time. Now I'm going to send a physician by to take a look at you. Then I want you to give your statement to the local police, OK? Keep her here until it's over. Then take her back to the lab. No problem. He's on his way. Well, I guess it's just a waiting game now. No, please, sit. John Rice's taped confession. Very good. Has... has Tucker been handled? Mr. Karns is taking care of it. Taxi. Worker's Union, I'm in a hurry. You got it, lady. That won't give us no more trouble. Is everything still on time? Of course. We should be heading over there pretty soon, don't you think? I'm still waiting for just one last thing. Everything's been resolved. Well, I think we better be going. I'd like to take Mr. Karns with us, just in case. Look, if you don't mind, I'd... - I'd prefer to watch it on television from here. See you in a few hours. You sure you don't want to come along? Look, I can't. I'm just too nervous. Me too. I'm afraid we might have gone too far. Don't say that. We're almost there. Perhaps that's what I'm afraid of. This is why I got into it, Jimmy. Sure, there are a lot road blocks. But every once in a while, you get to do something good. And maybe once in a lifetime you get the chance to do what I we're going to do today. I just hope it doesn't backfire. This is the greatest day. I saw something. I followed my instincts. And it turns out I was right. You know, if I had a billion dollars, I couldn't buy the publicity that this is going to bring me for free. And I'm going to take you with me, Jimmy. You were there the whole time. And I'm not going to forget it. Robert! Karns, look. I'll take care of it. Drop it! It's me, Suzanne. It's Suzanne. Look at me. Just listen. This isn't you. They've done something to you. You have something you have to do. Are you ready? Don't do it. Are you ready? Ladies and gentlemen, members of the press, Senator Davis has a statement of great importance, of which he'd like to read. Now, we respectfully ask that you wait until he has finished before asking any question. Now, Senator John Davis. John, I love you. Are you ready? Yes, I'm ready. For too long, the public has been strangled by the hold of companies that take government funding and then expect total autonomy to do what they... What the hell is he waiting for? However corrupt, immoral, or unscrupulous. Do it. Just turn around. Finish it. No! Which is why I have conducted an independent study... We're about to be ruined. And have already unearthed some rather startling information. This was the scene just moments ago at the Workers. Union, where an apparent assassination attempt against Senator John Davis went awry. Davis was unhurt. But his assistant Jimmy Morabito was fatally wounded in the shootout. We'll keep you informed with the latest up to the minute details as they become available. DR CHAMBERLAIN When all is said about the circumstances that led me up to this moment, my only hope is that it will be understood, that I did what I did in the name of all people and their future. Phillip Chamberlain. This will be the last time this process is ever performed. I want the entire apparatus destroyed. You're standing in the way of progress, Senator. Man has a right to this technology. What about this man? You weren't thinking of his rights, were you? Now do it. How's it going? Hey, babe. How you doing? We were kidnapped. I remember. I love you. You know, almost single handedly, you two uncovered one of the most devious conspiracies that this country has ever seen. And the powers behind this conspiracy were subsidized and encouraged, unknowingly, of course, by our government. The strength that must have taken over to overcome all of this is more than I can even comprehend. And I'd like to thank you both. And I'd like you to have these. Thank you, both. Good luck to you both. You, sir. Thank you, Senator. Good luck. I guess that makes us heroes. Think so? Let's go, hero.
