(apprehensive music with clock ticking) - The play starts now. It's an exciting thriller, very sophisticated. I hope you enjoy it, I want only to please you. But not in a pathetic way, in a thoughtful, considerate, non-clingy way. (dynamic music) - This just in. Police report another rape-murder, what appears to be the third in a series of brutal attacks. All we know is that he strikes in the south bay and his victims have blonde hair. Only blondes. He kills blondes. Blondes. Yellow-haired sirens. And that's not all there is to the pattern. Witnesses on the scene, an alley behind the Hair Today Beauty Salon on South Third Street report that once again, the victim has been mutilated. In what way? Police ask us not to release that information, but they offer women advice on how to cope with the situation. They recommend that you dye your hair some other color and obliterate your true self. But that's good advice even under ordinary circumstances. (woman crying) (despondent music) - Mary Beth, what's wrong? - Mom lost her job. I can't afford to stay in school. I'm too stupid for college anyway. I should just get a boob job and try and hook some nice rich guy. - No, Mary Beth. If you're waiting for a man to save you, you'll wait till you're dead. (keys clacking) - There's no reason I can't get a second job? - [Peter] Hey, all right, ladies, just in time. - Oh, wonderful. Peter Herring. How did you get in? - Well everybody must be at the Omega mixer 'cause the door was just hangin' wide open. - Did you close it? - I assumed it was open for a reason. - Don't you know there's a serial killer on the loose? - Well what are the chances he's gonna walk in here? (sighs) What's this fear of sex? - You're a pig. - Fine, I'm outta here. (gentle music) (Mary Beth cries) - All righty, this isn't working. See, for one thing, one doesn't have characters cry. They cry, the audience doesn't, that's a rule. Even worse, this is all just subplot, and I haven't even introduced the leads. I suppose I should introduce myself. I'm Steven, I'm a writer. Well, I'm actually a theater history professor, but I've always wanted to write a play and now I'm going to do it. I suppose I'm tryin' to prove something to myself. Also I have these two actress friends who teach acting and they're really good, but they don't get much work, so I'm writing parts for them. You haven't met them yet. I'm having trouble introducing the characters as early as I should. (lively music) - If you don't mind me saying, you have the blondest hair. (chuckles) - I'm a junior at State, I'm a theater major-- - So I bet all your girlfriends are really rooting for you to get the big part. - Why would I tell anyone I'm coming if I don't even know if I'm gonna get the job? - So no one knows you're here? You're here all alone and no one knows where you are? Your whereabouts are unknown, and if you were to say, go missing for one reason or another, no one would be able to trace you back to this hamburger stand? - That's right. (laughs) - (claps) Jesus. You know that opening scene when you said you weren't very bright? I just thought you were being self-deprecating, or maybe had low self-esteem or something. - You saw the first scene? - [Larry] Mm-hmm. - Did I cry convincingly? - Oh yeah. (apprehensive music) - What's that music? - Music? - That, that! I must be imagining it. - [Larry] Yeah. - Don't go in the basement. Don't go in the basement. He's in the house, he's calling from inside the house! - I think I better come back later. - Why? - I forgot something. - You heard that guy in the audience. - No, no, I forgot a French test today. I didn't want to take the test so I just forgot about it altogether. Gee, I'm late already. I'll come back later. - Just finish the application. - [Mary Beth] That hurts. - [Larry] Does it? - [Mary Beth] You know it does. - [Larry] How can anybody know how anybody else feels? (whipping) (Mary Beth gags and chokes) (sawing) (suspenseful music) - [Larry] Your hair is so blonde. (spurting) - [Mary Beth] Ouch, you're killing me. (coughs) Stop killing me. Ow, you're, (coughs) - Okay, we've introduced the killer, now what? (sighs) I have uh, no idea. I maybe should have (harp music) an outline or something before I, who are you? - I'm Thalia, muse of comedy and pastoral poetry. Now, mostly comedy. - Well why are you riding around in that bubble? - [Thalia] Well, your budget won't support a '52 Buick Roadmaster convertible lowered from the flyspace, but don't worry, I'm still ex-machina. - You know, you remind me of Mrs. Brody, my eighth grade English teacher who told me I'd never be a writer, that Nick Polaski, he was the writer. - Oh, (chuckles) I happen to know that Nick Polaski (bell rings) now sells tires. (horn honking) - I think I'm gonna like you. So Thalia, great muse of comedy, why have you deigned to visit our humble play? - Well, I'm here to give you inspiration and to criticize you, and to give you writing tips. - Great, what do I do? I mean, next. - Well, you still have to come up with the ideas, you have to write it. I just facilitate an open airing of the issues. - Could you be more definite? - You mean, definite like when I ordered the kuribandit priests to identify with the goddess Cebelle by castrating themselves? (yelling) - (chuckles) What I'd really like is for someone to tell me what happens next in the play. Just a hint, but without castration, and if well, if you're too busy I totally understand. - You're in Act I, which many writers feel is a good time to introduce characters. - Yes, of course. Immediately, your demi-goddess-ness. Cheerleader, dead. Librarian, alive. Introduce librarian. (keys clacking) (methodical classical music) - Hi, um, I need to know about this Italian guy, Piran Delio? - Pirandello. He was a great playwright. He blurred the line between stage and fiction. Interestingly, despite his artistic radicalism, Luigi Pirandello was an ardent supporter of the Italian fascist dictator Benito Mussolini. Otherwise known as Il Duce? Hitler's best friend. - Well, come on, everybody knows all artists are whiny liberals. - (chuckles) Many great artists were fascists. W.H. Auden, Leni Riefenstahl, Charlton Heston. - Okay, back to Peran Delio? - You want to start with the online card catalog, the subject file under Pirandello. It's alphabetical. There's also some unpublished masters theses-- - Well, can't you give me just like, one book that has everything in it, like a Cliff Notes or-- - The Encyclopedia Britannica's that way. (classical music) - Hector? Can you cover me for 20 minutes? - [Hector] Sure, what's up? - This job, it's like a nightmare. I've just gotta get something with a lot of fat grams in it. A milkshake. - [Hector] You goin' to Heavenly Burger? - Yes. - Bring me fries. Oh, Sara, hey, it's just an order of fries. I'll get you the money. - No, no, it's not that, it's just, I've gotta get out of here. - Eh, you go, I cover the desk. Remember, don't pig out. Vertigo is making' dinner. - Okay, okay. - Hey. You're the same guy from before. - I am a completely new character. Okay. I'm not really Hector. I invented Hector as a mouthpiece for the author. I disguised myself as an anti-communist, Cuban homosexual. I don't know why, it's, I'm not Cuban or particularly anti-communist. See, I based the character on an anti-communist Cuban homosexual theater critic who's comin' to see the show, review it. (apprehensive music) I wonder if he'll recognize himself. - I've lost my wallet. - At last, a plot development. - (sighs) Did you leave it at Heavenly Burger? Once you went out and forgot to get my fries, while greedily remembering a big, thick shake for yourself? - Maybe, I don't know. - Well, call them. - They were closing when I left. - [Hector] Look, suppose it is lost. What's the worst that can happen? - [Mary Beth] Ouch. You're killing me. - Just cancel your credit cards. - Where can it be? This is a nightmare. - All right, Sara, we got to go. We're late for dinner. - [Sara] I can't go without it. - Okay. (dialing phone) Heavenly Burger on Frost, eh? Maybe someone is cleaning up, huh? - It's an answering machine. Hi, this is Sara Carnegie. I was in your restaurant this afternoon. If you find my wallet, can you please, please give me a call as soon as possible. My number's on my checks. - So you want to cancel your credit cards? - No, I don't want to. I don't know what I want. - Sara, we got to go. Now. (upbeat Latin music) I just adore him. I've never loved anything or anyone so much. I'm home. - I thought you were dead. - Sorry, sorry, sorry. - That line's from Sunday Bloody Sunday. A lot of the lines in this play are stolen from other things. How many can you spot? - Are you over boring the audience? - Almost. Vertigo's not really a great actor. I cast him because I want into his pants. So I wrote the character based on my old boyfriend who's name actually was Vertigo, and whom I dated because he reminded me of my sixth grade teacher Mr. Vertigo. I keep trying to turn man after man into Mr. Vertigo. Reminds me of this Hitchcock movie that I saw once. It starred Jimmy Stewart and Kim Novak. I don't remember what the title was. Barbara Bel Geddes was in it. Okay, now I'm done. Do the exposition. - I don't know what the hell you're talking about. Ever. Guess what happened today at the salon? - [Sara] What? - The killer's latest victim was found in the alley next to the shop. - (gasps) Did you see the? - No, my shampoo girl found the corpse (screaming) but the police told her not to tell anyone the details, so don't tell anyone if you think they might be the killer. - The killer knows. - You're right. Tell anybody you want. - Now my character needs a drink. It's really just tea, but it looks like whiskey and I can pretend to be drunk. - I'd better check my sauce. - He's really coming out to make sure I don't make too large a drink. - What's with Sara? - What's ever the matter? Anything is an occasion for suffering. She's the logical conclusion of Protestantism, which have no mechanisms of forgiveness. - The answer to her problems is between a man's legs. (chuckles) (gentle guitar music) - I know. He doesn't seem very bright, but, he's smarter than he looks. He's very shrewd about getting what he wants. He doesn't seem to be doing anything and yet ends up with his way. Isn't that a better kind of intelligence than the intellectual kind that writes book reviews for 35 bucks a pop and winds up poor and alone? The kinda smartness that works in schools is overrated, mostly because the schools that dominate the smartness reign in business. I just adore him. I don't want to be alone. I've never loved anything or anyone so much. Why is it that, uh, men, straight or homosexual, when confronted with a nervous woman invariably say what she needs is a good screwing? - Because she does. (Hector chuckles) - [Hector] I mean she's good-looking. She doesn't have to be a cliche of a repressed librarian. - You think you could her run her life better than she can. But before you met me, your love life was at least as crummy as hers. (techno music) - Did you bring the ostrich? (sighs) There's a difference. Men can have promiscuous sex without getting emotionally involved. Now women get entangled even when they tell themselves they won't. - I know what would cheer Sara up. - What? - A complete makeover. I mean, new clothes, new make-up, the works. She'd look great as a blonde. - Blonde. (buzzing and ringing) Blonde, she'd never go for it. - Can I ask her? I mean, to a hairdresser, Sara is like a lump of clay waiting to be molded into a work of art. - Don't bring it up. She'll take it as criticism. - Yes, dad. - And now, let's do it. Right here in the kitchen. - No way. - Why not? - I don't feel that way about you. And doing it is not in the script. - It will be. The very next draft. You guys are doin' this to spite me! 'Kay, cut, this isn't working at all. - Oh. - Here I am trying to write a thriller and already we're on page, what page is this? 24 and still the heroine isn't even in jeopardy. I try to write a thriller, I do, but I keep veering off into chit-chat. So I want the play to be beautiful. I want it to be truthful. And I want it to be done. (jazzy piano music) - Steven, you want the play to be finished? - [Steven] Yes. - And you want the play to be good? - [Steven] Yes. - Cutting always helps. Hitchcock said, "Cinema is life "with the boring bits cut out." - He must have packed all the boring bits in a box and sent 'em to you. (chuckles) - Forget about the whole last scene. The only important piece of information in it is that Vertigo wants Sara to have a makeover. - Why is that so important? - Oh, well, the killer only kills blondes. All men are like the killer. Women must be altered to fit men's fantasies, like the serial killer alters his victims. - Should I, should my character make out a will? - I don't know. Anyway, I apologize. There'll be more jeopardy and murder and pointless death just as soon as I can get this doomed Titanic of a narrative turned around. - Don't you plan all this before you start writing? - I was busy. - Doing what? - Drinking. Alone, with the TV on and the lights up bright. Trying to impose the structure and conventions of the genre of thrillers on the fuckin' shit, dammit, ass. - Where do you think it went wrong? - Huh? - You've gotta get this thriller on the road. - I can't, I'm stuck! I don't even know why I'm writing it. - Then just get back to the plot. - Yeah, this is all talk. - I'm trying, but it doesn't compel me. Characters compel me. Acting is never the problem. The problem is always the writing. I know I'm not special. I'm no better than anyone else, and it really doesn't matter, and I'm getting older and nobody's ever heard of me but I think I was put here on Earth to create beauty, tell truths. Writing plays is the way I want to do it. Hell, without meaning, what's life? - The desperate struggle for some scrap of satisfaction, some respite from agonizing pain and in the end, the universe smashes you like a cockroach. - I don't know. I don't. - There, there, Steven, chill. No one says you have to write the play at all. The world certainly doesn't care, and you'll never make a nickel. Art's a terrible way to get money. If you just quit right now, it's doubtful anyone will notice. So why bother? - Scene. (Steven mimics phone ringing) - Yes? - [Larry] Hi, is this Sara Carnegie? - Who's this? - [Larry] Oh, my name is Larry Burger. I found your wallet. - Really? That's wonderful. - [Larry] Yeah. Yeah, I'm at your front door. - Oh, well can you come up? - [Larry] Sure. (plaintive music) (doorbell rings) - Oh. (laughs) I was in a panic. - (chuckles) I bet. - Where'd you find it? - Oh, it, (thundering chord) you better check and make sure everything's okay. - All my credit cards are there, that's good. That was my biggest worry. That and getting a new license. - Oh yeah. Well, I better go. - Oh, wait. At least stay for a cup of tea. - No, I wouldn't want to bother anybody. - Oh, you won't. I'm all alone. - Cut! - What's with the wig? - I knew you'd take it off before you answered the door. That's why I wrote in the mirror. Look, I'm pretty sure you'll be fine. - [Audience member] Author. Author, I have a question. - What? - I have a question. Is this a rehearsal or a performance or is the play still being written? - The play has been written, you're watching it. - How can I be certain that the relationship in the play - Such as it is. - I blame you for egging out Sara. - Between the parts the actresses play, and the actresses themselves is the same in the play as it is in reality. - And I don't remember writing dialog for the audience. Cast, onstage now! Get in a straight line. Okay. We're way behind. So I'm just gonna cut some of the scenes and tell the audience what happened. - You can't do that, this isn't a novel. You can't summarize. Novels have scene and summary. Plays only have scene. - How'd you like me to write a scene in which you eat some dog poo, hmm? Wanna eat some dog poo? Hmm, wanna eat some dog poo? - Ugh! - All right, then! Larry the killer leaves Sara's apartment and kills more women. - Done. - Then Peter, Mary Beth's boyfriend, hooks up with Lauren and they decide to solve the crime themselves. What? - Lauren is going after the killer? - Yes. - Couldn't you have me or Sara go after the killer? You wrote the play for us. Wouldn't it be more logical for us to be given something to do. - I would love to, but you have no motivation. Lauren does. Revenge. - Larry killed my best friend. (determined guitar music) - It's customary for the police to look after the killer. - [Steven] Ah, they aren't doing enough. They don't take her seriously. - Oh, you mean they don't believe her. So she has to go after the killer herself. Well that's in every Hitchcock movie. It's a cliche. - [Steven] I prefer the term convention of the genre. - Can't you go deeper? - Depth is nice but artifice is much more cheerful. Come on. - Did you catch that business with the wig? I'm onto him. He thinks he's so smart. (chuckles) Has anybody ever heard of him? If he were good people would have heard of him. If he were good he wouldn't be trying to write a stupid thriller. - If he were good he would show me truthfully instead of distorting me beyond all recognition. As for Sara, he's got her just right. (dynamic music) - This just in. Police suspect there's a second killer on the loose, the so-called torso killer, named for the manner in which he mutilates his victims, may actually be two men. The original killer and a copycat. Police have reason to suspect that the killer is a student at State University. (apprehensive music) (door clicks open) - Peter, what a delightful surprise. Have a seat. - [Steven] Cut! - What? I just started. - I wrote the scene with no bra. - [Glenda] And? - [Steven] And you're wearing a bra. - A Wunderbar bra? - A bra nonetheless. The script says no bra, as in braless. Bare breasted, breasts free to bounce wherever they like. - Well that's not how I'm doing it. - Why not? - I don't think it's right for my character. - It's not, you're telling me about the character? Who do you think wrote the character? Here's a hint, me. - Character. The only reason to have me braless is to pander to them, specifically the men. If you were straight you'd understand that a woman should have some mystery. - (chuckles) Well you must know different straight guys than I do. See, the straight men I know want to see everything revealed. Hell, they wouldn't mind if all women walked around completely nude, all the time. - Yeah. - They would prefer it. - Oh yeah. - So you admit you're using my body for cheap exploitation. - You'd think selling tickets was a crime? Look, my main purpose was to provide you an acting challenge. - (smirks) My breasts are not actresses. Look, it's my play, my vision, and I see you with no bra. - Oh, no. The only one who constructs me as an object of male desire is me. I will construct the identity of my breasts and by that I mean I'm not showing you my tits. - Boo, boo! - I tried. Just play the damn scene. (apprehensive music) - Peter, you weren't paying very close attention in class today. You seem preoccupied. - [Peter] Yeah, the thing is, um, I'm gonna drop the class. - I don't know what you mean. - Well, I like you, Dr. Cooper, but I mean at my age I should be dating around. - Peter, don't do this to me. - I mean, you are significantly older than I am. If I wanted to get married, I'd probably choose someone a lot younger and probably blonde. - You're a spoiled brat. - Glenda, what would people say? I mean. I'd better go. - Oh, Peter. (stammers) You hurt me and I'm drunk. - Glenda, get out of my way. - Peter, it's my fault. Let me change. Let me be anything you want. - Cut, loved it! Did you notice how I snuck in the theme in the last line, there? (laughs) - Number one, this isn't a movie. Number two, you couldn't possibly have written a more melodramatic scene, and number three, it has nothing to do with my life. - It's fiction, it's about life with a capital L. - Is it about my life? - It's my interpretation of life. - My life? - Look. Even if the character of Glenda were based on a real person, I couldn't discuss it. There are legal ramifications. Besides, I don't want to discuss the play. I don't want to critique the play. I want to finish the play, and I'm really, horribly lost, and you're not helping. I need inspiration. (harp music) - Did someone mention inspiration? - Tell him to write a scene that's about me. - Tell him not to kill me. - Tell him more murders. - Special effects and car chases. - Tell me what to do. - The nature of inspiration is fugitive. It cannot be bidden, so don't ask me your questions, ask them of yourself, and if you make quiet the yak yak yak of the critical inner voice, often I'll help if I feel like it. - I know you're somehow basing this inappropriate romance on my inappropriate romances, but it wasn't like this. It was different. Tell the truth. Why can't you just tell the truth. - I don't know the truth. You know, I don't really know that I like the truth. Truth. I want to entertain the audience. - I wish you did. But I get the feeling you're trying to disturb us, or even worse, to improve us. You presumptuous ass. I paid for a generic thriller, and that's what I want. - Look, anyone who thinks they can do a better job can write all the scenes he wants. - Fine, I will. I'll show you what really happened. (mystical music) Peter, you shouldn't have come. - But. - Our affair can only mean tragedy for me, once Victorian society discovers our dreadful secret. - But I can't live without you. The way you talk about art puts our love onto a spiritual plane. - But you must. (plaintive music) - Must what? - Give me up. - But I dreamt we would live happily ever after, at my house, Howard's End. - What that we could, but we shouldn't, mustn't. Our love can never be. - Can never be what? - Be. Exist. - [Peter] But what will you do? - [Glenda] I shall live out my days in a nunnery, embroidering your name on enumerable pillow cases. Farewell. - [Peter] If I can't have you, nobody will. - (gasps) Who are you? - I'm Sigmund Freud, and your problem is your relationship with your vater. - My water? - Your vater. You desire intercourse with your own vater, and so you must punish yourself by entering into relationships that are doomed to fail. - Oh, I see. The sun has burst through a bank of clouds. I'm well, well. - Cut! Cut! Kill the sunlight. See how bad that was? - Well you wrote it. - According to your specifications. - Well you're still writing me, you're just pretending this is a Merchant Ivory production. Me write the scene. I control my own representation, you paternalistic, white-male bastard. - There can only be one writer of the play. - [Glenda] Who says? - Why, tradition. - So how it's been is always how it should be. So we should still have slavery. (upbeat Latin riff) - Well, no, but the work needs to be unified. (harp music) - Actually the great Jacques Le Cacheux did some important work wherein the drama was created by the acting ensemble. - Le Cacheux is better than you. I love Le Cacheux. - Listen to her. Do you want a play with that kind of filth in it? Vote for me, writer of the play. - Stop doing that. - What? - Direct address of the audience. Those asides designed to establish yourself as the central intelligence, to make them your confederates against me. - I have no idea what you're talking about. If you're hearin' voices you must be schizophrenic. The uh, people on stage can't hear me when I do this. - I can hear him perfectly well, and what's more, I can address the audience as much as I want, thus making them identify with me. Now I'm the hero. - I'm confused. Why aren't there any black people in this movie? - Hello, Mr. Audience. - You don't do it right. Have to seduce the audience. I love you, audience. I love you so much. - Now you sound like Jerry Lewis, in which case the audience can love you only if they're wearing berets and reading Genet, Genet. Now there's another dramatist who's better than you are, Jean Genet. - Oh, he adored Le Cacheux. - I'm the writer of this play, now only me. - The movie Tootsie had 23 writers. It was a big hit and everyone loved it. - Et tu, Thalia? - [Thalia] Don't blame me, I'm just a dramatic device. You invented me. You're in control. Don't you forget that. - And all I have to do is take what's rightfully mine. Seize control. For example, with a few clicks of my computer keys I can put Glenda in a straitjacket, with one of them big gags on her and a ball that sadomasochists, use. (laughs) The characters are there for me to manipulate as I please. - Mmm, yes and no. - What do you mean, no? - Well, in one sense you can do whatever you want, but the question is whether the audience will accept it. - Go on. - Even in a piece that breaks the rules, there have to be rules. The universe you present has to be consistent. The rules you've established say that fictionalized characters can assert their wills independently outside of the play within the play. To change that now, just because you feel like it would be as if Superman just invented new superpowers every time he came up against a tough problem. The audience would feel cheated. - (exhales) Is that right? - Superman has too many powers as it is. I like the guys in Marvel comics who only have one power. That's better. You know, I've always thought I'd make a good actor. - No. - I want my money back. - (sighs) No refunds. You're perfectly free to go. I care nothing for the approbation of the mob. - I paid my money and I'm staying till the bitter end. You advertised a thriller. I'd better see one, or I'll sue you. - (chuckles) Good luck collecting. You're aware I'm a teacher, right? - (spits) This is a mess. It's falling apart. You're always putting women in corsets and silencing them, and pretending that you're making a statement about oppression that's really just oppression. And Freud be damned, and I quit. - Whoa, hey, hey, whoa, whoa, Glenda, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, look. I understand your need to protect your privacy and your desire for the play to conform to a more modern view of women than that of Freud who was, I admit, a paternalistic white bastard. If we can just get back to my thriller, I think you'll see that it's really an examination, a critique, if you will, of male violence toward women. - It's about a psycho who mutilates pretty girls. - Wait, hold, Glenda, hey, look, let's take a break, okay, and I'll go have a cigarette. When I come back this will be a tautly plotted thriller full of jeopardy and thrills and whammies. I'll even put in an explosion or two. Look, it'll be a big hit, like The Producers. - Oh. - It'll run forever, we'll all make a bundle. We'll be profiled in the Lifestyle section of the newspaper! Okay? - 10 minutes. - Vertigo awakes. (keys clacking) Vertigo: What are you doing? Steven: Making love to you. Vertigo: Don't stop. Don't ever stop. (pleasant music) - What are you doing? - Taking a nap. - There are nine million stories in the naked city, but they're all the same story. - Don't you want to sleep your way to the top, hmm? - You're the top? - Oh. I'm so top. - Look. I'm not interested in you, and there's nothing you can do for me, okay. - [Steven] Your part could get bigger. But that would be contingent upon one of my parts getting bigger. - I wonder why you have this need to humiliate yourself. - Isn't that what being an artist means? - Being an artist means making art, not trying to bang the whole cast. - I'm not trying to bang the whole cast. I'm not trying to bang you. - Get off. - Steven, you have some important decisions to make about this play. Why did you start it in the first place? - One morning I was reading the New York Times and I saw this article about a man, a neo-Nazi who murdered a hair colorist and a plastic surgeon for, quote, "giving women the power to destroy men," unquote. So I had the idea of writing a play that would explore the paradigm at the nexus of the trope, but without conflating the uh, uh, - You're making this up. - Well, for reporters, if they ever ask why I wrote the play. They wouldn't mind, they're entertainment writers. They prefer you to lie. - I don't think you have to worry about the critics because at this rate, you're never gonna finish the play. - [Steven] I know. - [Glenda] So really, why do you want to write a play? - 'Cause I want everyone to say what clever boy I am? - Why? - 'Cause Mommy and Daddy didn't pay attention to me. By writing a play I'll get all the attention in the world. (harp music) - Show business is diabolical, my darlings. It unfailingly attracts the people who most need love, attention, and reassurance, and it provides them with more neglect and rejection than any other field of endeavor. - It's not fair. - Hmph, life is not fair, not even for kings and queens. But hey, if you think you got it so bad, I know people who can give you polio. - Everything would be fine if you stop trying to write this contrived, plotty thriller and just did a sincere character study about me. - It so happens that audiences hate character studies. You know, if you ask people their favorite movie it's always something with danger, love or funny gags. I adore thrillers. - [Thalia] You adore 19th century British novels. That doesn't mean you should write one. - You know, for a muse, you're supposed to provide helpful inspiration, but all I get from you is crap. (thundering) - Ah! What happened? - [Thalia] Ooh, I'm so sorry. You've developed an ulcer. - Yeah, I wonder what caused it? - [Thalia] You worry too much. - Of course I'm worried. I've got an insoluble problem. The characters I care about, Glenda, Vertigo, Sara, they're all not really important to the plot. - Not important to the plot? Well, thank you very much. And who may I ask is important to the plot? - Lauren, the college girl who's trying to solve the crime. See, she's active. And Larry's important because well, you need a villain. - Um, I think Sara's story could be very interesting. She's a woman living with a killer and she doesn't know it. - I see. - Like in The Lodger, that silent film by Hitchcock. - Oh, he's so pedantic. No wonder I don't have sex with him. - This from a guy who's never seen a black and white movie? - You know, I was going to focus on the killer and the woman that he lives with, but I don't know what happens with them. - Well make it up. - Oh, easier said than done. - Just, just write from the heart. - You know, you're not in this scene. - I'm not my character. I'm me, your friend, the actress. You wrote this part for me! - And me. - Well, maybe not this part of the part, but oh, I'm so confused. I hate these things where you don't know if it's supposed to be reality or not. Ambiguity should be clear. - I know. - So just write whatever you feel like writing. - Thrillers have rules. It's a very precise genre. - Then don't write a thriller. (bouncy, jazzy music) - And then we can say whatever we feel like saying. We can speak the truth, we can improvise. - Get out. - I have a question. - Yes. - This part here, is this the truth? - Well, it's all truth with a capital T. It's a higher truth. - I mean, is it true, like real life is true? - Well is real life true? - [Audience Member] Sure. - Why? - Because we real-life people are saying what we really say. - Then you mean you're always telling the truth. - [Audience Member] What? - You real-life people, do you ever lie? - Of course not. - Liar! - My characters hardly ever lie. You real-life people lie to avoid conflict. Mary says, "Do you like my new dress?" Now in real life, John wants to avoid conflict, so John lies. He says, "Why, it's lovely." But in drama, see, we want conflict, so John tells the truth. He says, "Mary, your ass is huge." And that, that leads to conflict. So you see, if people don't tell the truth we have no conflict, we have no drama. You have a film that never gets past the festival circuit so sit still. - Can I be in the play? - Absolutely not. - Steven. Do you remember why you started this piece? - Why not write a movie instead of a play? Plays are boring and young people don't go to plays, only old people. People so old nobody sleeps with them. - This is boring. I want some of that Don't Go In the Basement stuff. What's that called? (lively bongo music) - Suspense? - Yeah, suspense. I bet you don't even know how to do that. - I do so. You show the audience the danger that lies ahead without showing it to the heroine. Show the bomb under the table, a man with a gun lurking around the corner. - Well if you know how to do it, then do it. - He would, but he doesn't want to. It's just craft, not art, as a character study would be. - This is all very interesting, but Steven has an inspiration. - I have? - Yes, it feels that while what you have to say is very stimulating, he'd rather go ahead and write a thriller, a very bloody one in which many blonde ones cross the River Styx. - I saw this coming. (determined guitar music) - Not so sure now. I mean, thrillers are so plot-driven, but a character study would let me go wherever I want. - Forget all that. You must have unity and order. All the great playwrights understood that. That's why Pirandello supported Mussolini. Il Duce made the plays run on time. - Okay, look, I'm sick of arguing. Thriller. - Nein. A psychiatric drama, hmm? - Cheerleader, back from the dead. - [Tribesman] A critique of the marginalization of colonized peoples. - Enough, we're just gonna skip ahead to Act III of the thriller. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Won't you skip a bunch of scenes? How will the audience catch up with what they missed? (smacking) - I'm bringing out the French maid. - What? It would be one thing at the beginning of Act I, but three-quarters of the way through the narrative, that's shocking. - I'm a desperate playwright. You know, well I say that clunky, overwritten exposition is better than no exposition at all. (sighs) And cue maid. (plucky, lively music) - I knew you'd get tits into this one way or another. You don't even like tits. - Shh. (phone rings) - Hallo? Oh, Fifi. I cannot talk long. The mistress will be home in a moment. So much has happened. As you know, Larry has moved in with Sara and she is so in love with him, but she does not know that he is a killer. - Now be sure to tell them that he won't sleep with Sara because he only kills blondes. Blondes, he loves them, he hates them. - He loves and hates the blondes. (gasps) (screams) (gun fires) (crashing) He hates the blondes. - She's dead. Did you hear me, she's really dead! (growls) Now who'll play the French maid on such short notice? - I will, I will! - I suppose you could play Saffron, black maid. Sassy black maid. Tells home truths to the really important white characters. Or the Rochester, the old family retainer whose calm folk wisdom makes life on the plantation that much more gracious. - Hell no. If I play Saffron or Uncle Rochester, that's racist. If I play the French maid, that's non-traditional casting. - I will not have my serious play turned into a camp-fest with characters in drag. - In costume. - Look, there's nothing lower than comedy. You'll play Uncle Rochester or you'll play nothing. - In other words, my choice is to play the anachronistic and demeaning stereotype or not break into show business? I'll be right up. Why should I have it any better than the Arabs? - And the women. - Look, you'd better let him play the French maid. You don't want a lawsuit. Besides, you already have the costume. We have nothing for Uncle Rochester. And you know how touchy the costume ladies get when you spring something on them. - Okay, go get in costume. But later you have to sleep with me. All the guys in the cast have to sleep with me. Well, except Freud. He reminds me of my father. - So not only do I have to play the demeaning stereotype but I also have to sleep with you? - Correct. - But I get to be in show business? - Yes. - Okay, lights. - [Vertigo] What's up? - What do you mean? - He means, what happens now? - We're waiting. - For what, Christmas? Gadot? - For audience guy to get into his costume. - Well couldn't you write something to cover the change? - I'm makin' this up as I go along here, look, we need his exposition before we can go any further. - Yes, but do something. Tell a joke. (spirited music) (Sara laughs) - Thank god I'm black and have masculinity to spare. (chuckles) - Okay, let's proceed, hmm? - Hey! Now that I'm blonde, won't Larry kill me? - Probably. (chuckles) - No, 'cause you're really a guy. And it would be really gay of Larry to kill you. (lively music) - Hallo? (gasps) Oh, Fifi, well, as I was saying, Larry, he loves blondes, he hates blondes. He has been murdering them as he lives with Sara. She has become more and more obsessed with him and has broken off all contact with the outside world. Meanwhile, Glenda, the mean one, she has been stalking Peter the fraternity boy, but he wants nothing more to do with her because he is in love with Lauren. (popping) Okay everybody, places for Hector's visit to Sara's apartment. (jazzy music) (doorbell rings) You have never been the type to drop your old friends just because you got a new boyfriend. - That's because I never have a boyfriend. If I'd had boyfriends I'd have been dropping my old friends all the time. - Seriously, it's rude. - It's just that, I haven't really... You'll say he's inappropriate and just give me some more time. - Oh. - Ah, hello. - Um, Larry, this is my friend Hector. - [Hector] Hi, how's you doing? Nice day, huh? Are you aware that your shirt is covered in blood? - Hmm? Oh, yeah, I cut myself shaving. - [Sara] Again? (Larry chuckles) I'll be in the bedroom. - Do his muscles get cold in that shirt? - Shut up. - Love the big phone. (glasses clinking) - Was he sexy? - Oh, very butch. And if she was in prison and she wanted someone to protect you to beat your husband, she'd want the type with the extra male chromosome. That was this guy, X-Y-Y. - Yech. - I can't picture that with Sara. - I make it a policy never to be surprised by someone else's boyfriend. - So now you feel better? - Much. Now that I've seen the secret lover I have a feeling she'll keep in touch. - Oh god, a live-in love slave, just like a man would have. - And what about your little Ken doll, eh? - There's nothing little about him. - Ooh. (laughing) Let's move on to Manhattans. - Thriller, plot, a thriller, plot. - This is intolerable. (apprehensive music) Now I'm not only a slut, I'm a lush, belting back the booze while making bitterly cynical remarks. - Character talking, it's not you. - I don't want to be the character. I want to be me. I want to be me, just a little thinner, and a little younger and a little smarter, like someone who immediately comes up with the witty remark that real people can't think of till the next day. Now that would be an honest portrayal. That's how Noel Coward would write me, but you, you're, you're fictionalizing me. You're still fictionalizing me. You're fictionalizing me even as we speak! (suspenseful music) Stop fictionalizing me! - Can't help it. It's inherent in the process. Look, I fictionalized me too. (ripping) - Yeah, but when you fictionalize yourself you give yourself the leading role, the funniest lines. - A big penis. - But I get heavy drinking, rejection and inappropriate partners. - You want the big penis? - I don't want the inappropriate partners. - You have to have the inappropriate partners. The theme is the ways in which women participate in their own victimization. - Oh, it's a sexist state. - Daring. - Why is that white, liberal men feel it's their duty to speak for the blacks, the women and everybody else? - Fine, now get over here. You're ruining my play! - I did you a favor. I made you post-modern. - I don't need that. I need jeopardy, a man, a gun, a woman in danger. - Oh, well how 'bout a woman, a gun, and a man in danger? (upbeat music) It's a real gun. Ooh, with real ammo, and I'm the real me. And I really hate you. - Glenda, you're a fictional construct. Cannot harm me, but you can harm yourself. I'm afraid you've become, shall we say, a liability to the narrative. I'm sorry, Glenda, we'll all miss you. - (sighs) Are you sure this is a good idea? - It seems an expedient solution. - I see two problems. One, what's her motivation? I mean, she hasn't been despondent, she hasn't even hinted she's feeling suicidal. - Then in the next draft I'll go back and I'll add a line, okay. I'm feeling so blue. Sometimes I think I should just end it all because Steven is so mean to his characters. - [Thalia] Okay, but there's a second problem, the audience won't let you do it. - What do you mean they won't let me do it? I'm the writer. The writer is god. I mean not in the movies, but in theater my authority is absolute. - [Thalia] Audience hates when things happen for the convenience of the author. They're completely obsessed with their own pleasure. - Oh, so I should just let her kill me, huh? You know what, this script isn't working, I quit. I quit! I no longer want to be a writer. I resign! (perplexing music) - [Thalia] (chuckles) I don't think that's necessary. Glenda can put down the gun, but she can't do it merely because it's convenient for you. She has to want to put down the gun. After all, drama is persuasion. All those lovely speeches in Shakespeare, they're mostly about persuading someone of something. And by the way, I know Shakespeare. - Yeah? - [Thalia] You remind me of Shakespeare. - 'Cause I write like him? - [Thalia] No, because he wrote plays mostly so he could meet guys. - Oh Glenda, wouldn't you like to come out and point the gun at my head? - I certainly would. And I'm gonna kill you. - Yes, of course. Go right ahead. - Wait. - Vat, what? - Don't do it. You will ruin your life. - Oh, look, it's Dr. Freud. And he's going to psychoanalyze me. And I'm going to remember childhood trauma, and that's gonna free me from this madness, like The Three Faces of Eve and other psychiatric melodramas of the 1950s. - No, Glenda. That's all hoot, hmm. Nowadays, we know that digging into the traumatic past can sometimes increase its grip on the present. - Really? - Yeah. Even once the trauma has been exposed there remain negative habits of thinkings that punish you every moment of your life. - What can I do? - Cognitive therapy. - Cognitive therapy. - Yeah. It teaches us to examine our own thinking. - Well, I don't have time for long, drawn-out therapy. - (chuckles) Cognitive therapy takes 12 to 24 weeks or even less. Come, Glenda, happiness is your birthright, eh? (inspiring music) - I've always depended on the kindness of people who are paid to be kind to me. - It is the only dependable form of kindness. Cognitive therapy, the key to a better life. Ask for it by name, hmm? - Well that was a bit didactic, wasn't it? - Or is it polemical? I can never remember. (Vertigo laughs pompously) - Course if the therapy doesn't work, I'm coming back to kill you. (apprehensive music) - Okay, French maid. Set up the thrilling climax. The audience is gonna love it. - You know I'm concerned there are so few minority cast members in this show. I mean, seeing how well I'm playing the part of the French maid perhaps non-traditional casting would work for other roles as well. For instance, you could be played by an old Korean woman. - Oh, did you know we're not paying the cast? - [Audience Member] What? - The cast only gets paid if the film makes money, and the film never makes money. The distributor sees to that. - If I'm not going to be paid, I'm not going to be in your damn show. - Well I can certainly appreciate that. - I quit. - I quite understand. - And I'm keeping the outfit because I find it oddly exciting. - If no one else has any objections let's finish this thriller. Places, everyone. - Where do you go at night? (classical music) Sometimes you're gone for hours. Is it a woman? - No. - Put your arms around me, Larry. (Larry stammers) Why not, Larry, we live here together. Make love to me. - Later. - Larry, why can we only make love in sick ways, why? - Just leave me alone. - Larry, don't you like women? - Of course I do. - I'm a woman. - Yeah, but you're not a blonde. Blonde women are the only ones worth killing. I mean, loathing, loving. - Then get out. God damn you, I'm sick of being your maid. - Fine, fine. I'll come back for my shit later. - Wait, Larry, come back. I'm sorry I yelled, just please don't go. - No, you're better off without me, Sara. - There's time. We'll both change. - No, nothin's gonna change. I like you, Sara, I really do, but you don't have what turns me on. Maybe it's better this way. - Go out for a while, Larry. Go out and come back in three hours. - Why? - I'll have a surprise for you. - All right. All right, I'll come back later tonight, but only tonight. And then I've gotta move on. (door slams) (phone dialing) (phone rings) (phone beeps) - Hair Today. - [Sara] Vertigo. - Sara, you sound weird. - (cries) It's nothing. Do you remember offering to do a makeover? - Of course. - Well, can you do it right now? - It's the middle of the night. I only came in to do the books. How about tomorrow? - No, it has to be right now. - Okay. Come on over. (phone beeps) - [Sara] How can you make hair longer? - [Vertigo] With extensions. - [Sara] But, if you're making it longer why are you cutting it? - [Vertigo] Shut up, you'll be beautiful. - Jar noticed, and I'm halfway through Buzzville on my way Drunksberg. Okay, go get in your wig for the climax. All right now when Sara goes out she's gonna look for her grandmother's pearls but she's gonna find a videotape, watch it on TV and make a dramatic discovery at the most opportune moment! (apprehensive music) (snips) - Pearls. Grandmother's pearls. - [Steven] All right, now when Sara goes out she's gonna look for her grandmother's pearls, but she's gonna find a video tape instead, watch it on TV and make a dramatic discovery at the most opportune moment. - [Mary Beth] Don't kill me. Ouch, that hurts. Stop killing me. Ouch, ow! - [Larry] Look, I'm not gonna hurt you, I'm just gonna kill you. - [Mary Beth] Ouch, you're killing me. Ouch. - [Larry] The windows are all closed, okay, no one can hear you scream. (suspenseful music) (phone dialing) - 911. I'd like to report a murder. - Sara? - Larry. - You're blonde. - I did it for you. - For me? - Yes, Larry, for you. I want you to take me. - (gasps) To take? - I have yearned for so long for a man who would ask me to sacrifice everything to prove my love. I have so much to give you, and now, at last, I'm yours. - Oh. Oh, you've been watching TV. - Why yes, Larry. Where else is a woman to get her ideas about sacrificing everything to a man? - You found the tape on the (stammers) where I hid it. - The armoire. - I meant to hide that better. - Too late. - (laughs) I don't know why I do these things. I really don't. It's as if it happens in slow motion, and then I can't stop myself, and then afterwards I get really scared because after all, I could get caught. - Poor Larry. - And it only happens when I'm depressed, you know? I get very tense. - I know. - I really wish it didn't have to be this way. I loved you. I loved you more than any of the others. - And I loved you too. - And you weren't a blonde. - Now I am. (sirens wailing) - Now you are. (suspenseful music) So blonde. It's beautiful. - [Sara] Larry. - If only you hadn't been so nosy. If only you had stayed the same. You are (dramatic music) I'll never trust another woman. (siren wailing) - I can't believe it, I'm done. I've written whatever this is. - And I'm proud of you. Wasn't it clever of me to plant the scissors? I knew where you were going when you had me try on the blonde wig. Now we can all go home. - Not quite, darlings. You need a denouement. - Oh, you mean like where you tie up the loose ends? - Right, so what are the loose ends? - Glenda, whether her cognitive therapy works, whether our friendship will survive. - Darlings, I'm back. (laughs) And I'm much more good-natured. You always wanted to write my life and now that I let you, I'm completely contented. I'm very happily married to Peter, very happily. The age difference doesn't matter to us at all. In fact, we play this game called Dynasty in which I dress up like Joan Collins. - Good, you'll be happy forever. - Because I dress up like Joan Collins? - The fixity of dramatic characters. You see, even though we've pretended you're an actual actress with an existence independent of this work, in fact, you exist only within the boundaries of the piece, so however you are at the end, that's how you remain forever. - Happily ever after. How splendid. - And that's only one of the reasons art is better than life. - Will the audience buy it? - Oh, yes. Glenda's sins have not been great and she deserves happiness. Audiences are very just. A little vengeful, but it's only that they like to see people get what they deserve. That's why they like fiction. If they wanted to see evil rewarded and goodness punished, they'd read the newspaper or go to work or attend movies more serious than this one. - Hey, now wait a minute. What about me? I don't get what I deserve. I only kill blondes because of my childhood, you know. My mother was a blonde and she neglected me, ignored me. - Yeah, after you killed her. - Right, right. So I was an orphan. - Yes, but you were only an orphan because-- - Well I never had much happiness, you know. I heard all that stuff about the fixity of dramatic characters and I don't want to be dead forever and ever. I think comedy lady here should write me a happy ending too. (chuckles) You ever see Halloween? Hmm? The psycho killer only appears to be dead, and then he pops up and he's alive again. And I will kill again. I'll wait in the parking lot and kill members of this very audience. (suspenseful music) (smacks kiss) - No one will ever produce a play where characters kill the audience after the show. - Hey, sound man. Give me a really, really big crash. (tires screeching) (crashing) Too bad for Larry. He died before he could repent his sins, so he'll burn in hell forever and ever. Would the audience like that? - Larry was cruisin' for a bruisin'. - So what else is the audience waitin' to know? - What they always wait to know, does love triumph? - You mean do I go to Brokeback Mountain with Vertigo? Let's see. (piano music) - Look, I just don't think it would work. You only like me because I remind you of Kim Novak. I mean, because I'm like her in that Alfred Hitchcock movie. I mean I don't look like Kim Novak, obviously, but I remind you of an image in your head. - Yes, but that's why anybody likes anybody. That's what romantic love is. We've all got this movie inside our heads of the perfect love, the perfect love story. When we meet someone who's perfect casting, well, that's why we date. And even married people we wouldn't have dinner with under other circumstances, because that person is the movie in our head. - Ironically, this whole thing is a movie in your head. - Sigmund, I'm busy. Vertigo, you must have that movie in your head, don't you? Don't you have a type? - Actually, - Yes? - I tend to go for older guys who think they're smarter than they are. - I love fiction. Come here, you fictional construct. I'm going to objectify you tonight, repeatedly. (Vertigo laughs) - I don't even know where you live. - Oh, well. I've got a great rent-controlled apartment. A master bedroom, an office, big guest room. - Mother will love that! (bewitching music) (jazzy music)
