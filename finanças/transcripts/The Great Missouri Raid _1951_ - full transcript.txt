[woman narrating] This is the story of Frank and Jesse James and the men who rode with them. They were desperate men, the most notorious outlaws of all time. It's hard for me to say this because I knew them, knew them so well. The James boys, they were my sons. Outlaws? They were outlaws, but they didn't start that way. Frank... Frank, my oldest son. A great mind turned to crime, an unhappy man who could never escape from himself. Jesse, Jesse James, my youngest son, who fell to the bullet of one of his own kind. His kind because, sick for revenge, he chose to be an outlaw. Cole Younger, Franks closest friend, once so staunch and steady. He would have been a lawyer, perhaps even a statesman, if he hadn't become a bank robber. Jim Younger, ravaged with bitterness and disillusionment, sustained by hate. Bob Younger, a boy who followed his older brothers out of blind worship. Wrong? Yes, they were wrong. But remember, they lived in a time of violence, in an age of strife, men dedicated to what was to become a lost cause. They started as soldiers in a war. You called the war between the states the Civil War, but where we lived in western Missouri, it was worse than war. It was neighbor against neighbor with blazing torch and lash and the hangman's rope. This is your last chance. Where's that stepson of yours? I told you, I don't know. Talk! Talk, or up you go. I don't know. Pull him up. - [man] Sergeant Trowbridge? - Hold it. Look what we found. Well, if it isn't baby brother Jesse. [laughs] Where's Frank, Jesse? I said where's Frank? Well, since you don't feel like talking, maybe you'd like to watch a little. Pull him up. Little more. Pull him up a little more. Get off this farm, or I'll blow you to kingdom come. Put that gun down, you fool. I said get off this farm. All right, ma'am, but we'll be back. Mount up, men. - Stand where you are. - [shotgun fires] Come on. Get him up against that tree. This'll make you change your mind about talkin'. No! - No! - Talk! No! [gunshots] Over there. I'm sorry I didn't get here sooner, Ma. We'll get even, Jess. We'll get even. Frank, he's all cut up. Take him into the house. No, Ma. I know you want him to stay here on the farm, but he's killed a bluecoat now. They'll be back after him. He's gotta take to the brush with the rest of us. - Come on. - But he can't go like this, Frank. I gotta, Ma. But if they hurt you or Pa... Come on, Jess. - Take care, Frank. - I will, Ma. Don't worry. - [whooping] - [gunshots] According to this, the federal government grants amnesty for all, including irregular soldiers and partisans. Doesn't say anything here about guerrilla fighters. Partisans, guerrillas, the same thing. - It's amnesty for all. - That's right. All we have to do is ride into Independence and surrender to the provost marshal. Of course, we gotta swear we won't take up arms against the federal government. That's over. The war is ended. Sure. We lost. I don't know. These Yanks are riding pretty high hereabouts, foreclosing on farms 'cause folks can't pay the taxes. How can they when they haven't raised a crop in two years, ever since Order Number 11, when the Kansas men burned all the crops in the fields? I don't like this idea of surrendering. In fact, I don't like anything that involves the Union Army. We stay out, they'll hunt us down. We ride in, they'll hang us. All right, we'll play it safe. One of us will ride in, find out if this really applies to us. Which one of us will ride in? - I will. - What's the matter with me? No, Jess, I'll go. Don't take any chances, Frank. [no audible dialogue] Major, there's a man outside who wants to talk to you about a parole. All right, send him in. He's a bushwhacker. Send him in. Yes, sir. - What's your name? - Frank James. [pen scratching paper] Your regiment? I was a partisan. - Bushwhacker. - I rode with Quantrill. I think you know that. Yes, I know that. I also know you have a brother named Jesse. Where's he? That's why I'm here, to see about a parole for all of us. How many are there? Eight. What's their names? Never mind. Doesn't make any difference. So you want to surrender for all of 'em, is that it? The proclamation said all partisans... I know what the proclamation said! Bring in your friends and they'll be given paroles, after you take the oath of allegiance. We expect to do that. Brill! Brill! Yes, sir? The man that just left here was Frank James, one of the worst of that gang. My brother was killed on the James farm, murdered in cold blood. You mean the Samuels farm, sir. James, Samuels, what's the difference? It's all the same. His mother married that old horse doctor, Samuels, but they're her sons. Frank and Jesse killed my brother, and now they've got the brass to come to me expecting amnesty. What about the regulations, sir? I know the regulations in this district. If they come in, I've got to give 'em a parole. Ifthey come in. Sergeant, how about you and some of the boys getting yourselves a few drinks? Sure, Major. Thanks. And after the drinks? Do I have to draw you a picture? [no audible dialogue] - Bushwhackers! - We're coming in to surrender. [whinnies] He's gonna be all right, Frank. He's hurt bad, Cole. They got Arch too. Go out like that, after the war is over... It isn't over yet. Not for us. Whoa! Mrs. Samuels. - Where's Jesse? - Over yonder. Jesse? Jesse! Hello, Ma. Jesse, you're hurt. You're hurt real bad. - I'll be all right. - No, you won't. Not here. Ma, you shouldn't have come. - The bluecoats... - Nobody followed me. - Put him in the wagon. - Can't. - They posted us dead or alive. - I know. I'm not taking him home. We're going to Cousin Martha's in Nebraska. He's gonna need a lot of care, and he can't get it here. Easy. Where are you fixing to go, Frank? We got some unfinished business. None of that now, you hear me? Ma, they killed Arch Clements, and they did this to Jess. I won't have it, you understand? The war is over, and there'll be no more killin'. Now you hide out here in the brush till things clear up a bit. Pa and some of the people are writing to the governor. Cole, you're more levelheaded than the others. Don't evade me. And stay out of trouble. Don't go meeting it halfway. Very well, ma'am. We'll give it a try. All right, Ma. Hello. Hello. Say, you're Bee. You remember. I remember a little girl with pigtails. Who went to live with the Yankees. I'm glad you're feeling better. - How long have I been here? - Three weeks. And this is the first time I've known what's what? Is it? You talked to me several times. You even held my hand once. Only once? [chuckles] Now I know you're feeling better. The wound in your shoulder took a long time healing. Ma still here? Yes. I'll call her. Wait. Nothing. [cattle lowing] It's getting kind of warm, isn't it? It sure is. - General here's gonna be all right. - Good. - Here you are. - Oh, no, not another lemonade. - I thought you liked it. - I hate the stuff. But keep bringing it. Jesse, you stand a little news? The doctor says it's all right for you to travel. I thought he said it'd be another week. He wasn't counting on the kind of nursing you got. We'll start as soon as I get our things together. Your ma's looking for you, Bee. Think she wants a little help with her packing. So you're going back? Kearney's our home too. We only moved up here because of the war. Bee, I'm glad you're going home. So am I. [chattering] - Hiya, Cole. - Hi. What happened to you? You look like you've been in a fight. - They just burned my barn. - Do you know who started the fire? Sure, I do. A bluecoat. I took a shot at him. They better not try it around here. I won't just shoot at'em. What's this about bluecoats? They're having a lot of fun. Day before yesterday they burned down Jim Cummings's place. Today they burned down my barn. Sorry to hear that, Cole. They'll be lighting matches around here before long. If Trowbridge can't get us one way, he's gonna get us another. His men are sure cockier than ever. Let 'em strut. Keep out of their way. How can you keep out of their way if they burn your place down? Look, Frank, how long do we gotta waste our time mending fences? Jess, I'd like to fight 'em as much as you would. I grant you they're looking for trouble. I've no doubt they set the fires. Maybe there'll be more fires. But we've got to hold ourselves in. So long as we can. [train approaching] [bell clanging] [clanging continues] - Jesse. - Bee. - So you've come home. - Yes. - I'm glad. - So am I. - Where are your folks? - They'll come along in a week. I'm gonna stay with friends until they get here. All grown up, eh? Oh, Frank. She's still got the same pretty blue eyes. - [chuckling] Thank you. - Buggy's over here. We're gonna drive you to Kearney in style. How's the place look to you? Nothing's changed. [Jesse] Up you go. - Sure is pretty, ain't she? - Sure is. Where do you live, miss? We're off duty tonight. - Hold it, Jesse! - I can handle this. I know, I know. Come on. Get Bee out of here. Fifth Wisconsin Cavalry, eh? Yeah, sure. What was your outfit? Missouri. You boys sure gave us a shellacking at Westport. Now, wait a minute You won at Westport. You're Frank James. - Sure, I am, but I was at Westport. - So was I. You were with Quantrill's bushwhackers. - What of it? - Jesse, no. Stop it, Jess. Trowbridge wants trouble. You're playing into his hands. Now calm down. All right, now move on, soldier. Not till I give the bushwhacker's girl a little squeeze. [grunts] [blows landing] [groans] All right, Jess, come on. Go on. Make your report to Trowbridge. Get your gun. All right, get on your horses and get moving. - I'm sorry, Bee, but... - There'll be trouble over this. Can't be helped. Why didn't Frank come home with you, Jesse? He had a couple of things to do in town. Your supper's ready. No, thanks, Ma. [man imitating birdcall] Frank. - What's the matter? - Nothing. You don't fool me. What is it? Nothing, Ma, honest. Everything's fine. Then why the whip-poor-will whistling? All right. They're after us, Jess. - It was my fault, Ma. - What have you been up to? You knew they'd been laying in wait for you. Why'd you have to stir 'em up? They didn't need any stirring up. I wrote the governor. It seems the army is still in command. - There's a Major Trowbridge... - Wait a minute, Pa. [hoofbeats] - [door closes] - Jesse, Frank... Come on. [Frank] We haven't been here. [pounding] - [pounding continues] - [man] Open up! [pounding continues] Take that room, boys. - Where are they? - Who? Your sons. They're not here and haven't been. You don't set four places for two people. - Sergeant. - Yes? - You got a warrant? - Yes, we got a warrant. I'm sorry. And I've got to serve it. - On me? - No, lady, not on you. On your sons. [hoofbeats] - They aren't here. - No, they aren't here. But there is a law against harboring criminals... even for mothers. Come on, boys. My place yesterday, yours today. What are we supposed to do, spend the rest of our lives living in the brush? We don't have to stay here. Let's go someplace else. Come down to Texas with me, Jim. What'll you do in Texas? Starve? The carpetbaggers are just as bad there. All right, I don't like it any better than you do, but there's nothing we can do about it. We lost the war. We're outlaws. If we're outlaws, let's get something for it. - Now listen to me, Jim. - You listen to me! What do you say, Clell? I'm with you. Cummings? Count me in. Me too. I'll string along with you. [hoofbeats] I just heard about your place, Charlie. - How's the arm? - I'm gonna live. Not one of us can show our faces anywhere. What's it all about, Cole? The boys are fed up. For that matter, so am I. - And? - We're outlaws. Face it. - Let's get paid for it. - What would you suggest? There's a Yankee bank over in Liberty, bustin' with money. We're outlaws because of what we did during the war. - But robbing banks... - What's the difference? We're fair game for every bluecoat and lawman that sets eyes on us. Is this any kind of a life for a human being to live? I say let's get paid for it, and give them what they give us. You know, before the war I used to think I'd become a lawyer. Now I guess I'll be a bank robber. - You too, Cole? - We're being forced into it. No, Cole. You've made up your minds already. We have. Frank isn't gonna talk. [man] Get 'em up! [no audible dialogue] [woman screams] All right, all right. We know that they were masked. But you could give me a physical description of them, couldn't you? I don't know. I was too excited. You know the James boys and the Youngers, don't you? Well, more or less, I guess. What do you mean, more or less? You either know them or you don't. I've seen them around. Getting you to admit that much is quite something. The truth of the matter is, you people are all scared to death of these bushwhackers. Anyone living around here during the war would be afraid of them too. I was here during the war. I was the one that enforced Order Number 11, remember? Then you ought to know what happens to people who turn in a guerrilla. You know Frank James, don't you? Well, I know him by sight. And you were in the bank when this thing happened. Did you recognize him? How could I? They wore masks, like he said. [scoffs] Broad daylight. A hundred people standing around, and not one of you recognized anybody. Not one of you! All right. You can't say for sure that Frank James was one of 'em, can you? No, sir. Well, can you say for sure that he wasn't? - Well... - Answer me! Can you? - Well? - Well, no. No, I can't. That's good enough for me. All right, Sergeant, get 'em. Thank you, gentlemen. That'll be all. [hoofbeats] [Brill] Come on out, Jesse, with your hands up. Get in the other room. No, Frank. You'll be killed. Get Ma in the other room! Hurry up. [hammer clicks] [gunshots continue] Trowbridge. Dear God. What'll come of this now? - They were asking for it. - They wouldn't let us alone. You'll have to leave. They'll be back with more men. I know. [gunshots] Major Trowbridge, you say that you can give us information on the recent bank holdups at Gramatan and Liberty. Gentlemen, I can give you the names of every man who participated in those robberies. I can tell you exactly what every single one of them looks like. Frank and Jesse James, Clell Miller, Jim and Cole Younger, Allen Palmer, Arch Clements... Arch Clements is dead. He was killed in a fight with some soldiers. [man] Soldiers under your command. My command no longer, sir. I've resigned from the army. Major Trowbridge, you were asked to resign. You've opened a private detective agency, and you want the Bankers Association to retain you. Gentlemen, you want the bank robbers, don't you? Well, I'm the man who can get them for you. Perhaps, Major. Perhaps. We've made inquiries about you. You were a Kansas militiaman under Lt. Col. Plumb. You were very zealous in enforcing Order Number 11. I question whether your scorched-earth policy was necessary. They wanted war. We gave them war. You never lived on the Kansas border, did you? Well, I did. You couldn't possibly know the kind of people that we had to deal with. Bushwhackers, murderers. Frank and Jesse James shot down my brother in cold blood, my own brother, and I intend to devote every waking moment of my life to getting those two and their whole gang. That may take some doing. The report we have from Clay County is that the James boys are away... California. They're away. You may be assured of that. But they'll return, and when they do, I'm going to get them. Oh, they've got spies everywhere, yes, but so have I. Thanks, Doc. Thanks very much. Hope this does it. Oh, I'm sure that'll be all right. Bye. And if it don't get any better, I'll come back. All right, you do that. Who's that? That's Benson's hired man, Jack Ladd. He's new around here, isn't he? Oh, he's been around here six, seven months. Whoa. - Mornin', miss. - How do you do? Ain't seen you around here before. I haven't been here lately. Mrs. Samuels happens to be my mother's cousin. Oh, yes. You're Miss Moore then. Hear the boys are comin' back from California. I... I don't know anything about that. Git. Hello, Bee. How are you? Fine, Dr. Samuels. Gonna go tell Ma you're here. This place sure needs cleaning up, if I can ever find the time. Bee just drove in. Yeah, I saw her coming. Figured Jess and she would have a lot to say to each other. You know, Ma, we'd still be in California if he hadn't kept a-pestering me about coming back. He sure talked about her a lot. It ain't right. No life for a girl. Oh, Jess'll settle down. Question is, will Trowbridge let him? Ma, Bee and I decided to get married. I'm glad. You love him? Oh, very much. You're gonna be happy. Real happy. I know. [organ plays "The Wedding March"] [people laughing, chattering] Good luck! - [man #1] Happy honeymoon. - [man #2] Good luck! [chattering, shouting continue] Good-bye! Good luck! Now, remember your instructions. Keep back. They'll come out of the house just like they did before, and then we'll pick them off. All right, now move out. [Ladd] All right, come out of the house, Frank and Jesse. [gunshots] They just won't leave us alone. No, John! No, you can't. Not alone. Bolt the door. Bolt the door! [gunshots continue] Come out! If this doesn't bring them out, nothing will. My arm. My arm. Jesse, what is it? It's Ma. She's been hurt bad. Oh, no. They had to operate. She lost her arm. Trowbridge again. - You're going? - I've got to. That's what they wanted. They'll be expecting you. I can't help it. Jesse, you can't go. If you go back now, you're... you're gone forever. - How's your Ma, Jesse? - She's a little better. You know, I can't for the life of me figure who it could've been, except that they must have hated us something awful. We've been away in California 'most a year. Didn't let anyone know we'd come back home except the family and the boys. They didn't talk. [horse nickers] Well, having trouble with Brownie again, huh? - Yeah, Dr. Samuels. He's still lamed up. - That's too bad. Say, that was sure terrible, what happened here night before last. Yeah. You Benson's hired man? Why, yes. I'm Jesse James. I live here. Well, I'm sure glad to meet you. You were here the other day? [chuckling] Yeah. You, um... You been coming here a lot. - Well, sick horse. - How sick? Well, uh... Doc, you know. Hey, come to think of it, this horse wasn't very sick. Neither was the dog or the horse he brought here the other day. I don't know what you're talking about. I only work for Mr. Benson. He sends me over with the animals. You sure about that? I'm thinking Trowbridge gives you your orders. Trowbridge? Why, who's he? How long have you lived around here? Eight months. Then you're a liar. No man can live in Clay County and not know about Trowbridge. I don't get to town very much. I didn't come here to argue. If you don't want to fix my horse, well, I'll be going back to Mr. Benson's. Excuse me, ma'am. [train approaching] [whistle blows] [screeching] [cattle lowing] You turn those other horses out to the west 20? First thing this morning. Collect the firewood for the house? Did it last night. Perfect hired man, ain't ya? Well, if you know what's good for you, you better not try to take my job. You sure you gave those horses enough to eat? Yeah. Got anything else you want me to do? No, nothin' Thanks very much. - [chickens clucking] - [cows mooing] - Good morning. - Good morning. - How are you today? - Just fine. - Hey, let me do that. - Oh, no. I've been taking care of horses since I was 12. Pa says you're taking the day off. Well, the hay's all in. I thought I'd go to New Home today. You know, I got some buyin' to do. Think I'll go with you. I don't know exactly where I'm going to be. Going to meet a friend. We might even go fishing. Oh. It's all right. August is going in tomorrow. I'll go with him. Have a good time, Dave. Thanks, Miss Mary. Mary. Mary. Hey. How is it you can get a day off whenever you feel like it? - I haven't had a day off since I've been here. - Sure, sure. You're a hardworking man. The boss likes you, and so does Mary. Don't you? [chattering] - What'll you have? - Beer. Right. Oh, hello, Sheriff. - You're John Bauer's new hired man. - That's right. Well, how they treating you out there? Fine. That fella August causing you any trouble? Oh, nothing to speak of. Good. Glad to hear it. Come on, Sam. Don't drink too much, Tony. Dave, glad to see ya. - Haven't seen you for a long time. - Well, hello, Steve. - Give me a couple beers. - Well, I've been pretty busy. - How are things? - Oh, can't complain. Crops are good. Excuse me, gentlemen, but would you be good enough to... See, things haven't been going to well with me lately... Here you are, neighbor. - Thank you. - You're an understanding gentleman. You know, I remember when the first rail... Well, here today and gone tomorrow. - Hi, Jess. - Hiya, boys. Everything all set? - Cole, you sure the money's on that train? - Yep. That job's a matter of timing. We all know what we gotta do, and we gotta do it at the right moment. It'll be done, Frank. It always has been. - Say, how much money do you think it'll be? - Not less than $50,000. $50,000? Well, let's go. - Only one thing worries me about this deal. - Yeah? What's that, Jess? That I won't be able to see Trowbridge's face when he hears about it. [clicks tongue] Hyah! - Giddap! - Hey! Hey! [chattering] - Hey, Will! - Yeah? - Wanna play some poker? - Sure! Deal me in! All right, you're in. You're in, boy. Get over here. A bunch of cavalry is a little more than we counted on. - We'll just have to make the best of it. - Yeah. - This is the spot. - Uh-huh. - [chattering continues] - What do you say over there, Sarge? [whistle blowing] - What's going on? - Who cares? Deal the cards! There's something on the track around the curve. Better go slow or you'll wreck your train. - Hey, thanks very much. - Don't mention it. - You can't come up here. - Can't I? - Of course not. - Oh, yes, he can. All right, start 'er up. Just a few friends of mine. They want to talk to ya. - You don't mind, do ya? - Uh-uh. Not at all. - Good afternoon. May we? - Fine. Yes, sir. - Now listen, Mr. James... - Tell me later. - [gunshot] - That's enough of that. It's a holdup! Grab your guns! Hold it, boys! Take it easy and nobody'll get killed. [gunshots] Over here! Get movin'! Back to the boxcar, men! - Hyah! - Hah! Hyah! [shouting] Come on! Come on! Hyah! Get! Hyah! Hah! Hah! Hyah! Hyah! Hah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! - Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! - Let's go! Hah! All right, you can stop now. [brakes hissing] [gunshots] Drop it, or the next one's through your head. Now lookee here, mister. You're Jesse James, I suppose. I was always on your side because I figured you boys got a bad deal. But now you're just common, ordinary robbers. There's 50,000 in that safe, and that isn't ordinary. Open it up. It's a true safe. I haven't got the combination. Open it up. [gunshots] - Hyah! - Hurry up! Clell's in trouble. All right, move. Move! [gunshots continue] - You see, Mr. James? I... - Shut up! Here it is! Get going! [gunshots continue] We lost 'em. But we can't stay here. They'll catch up with us sooner or later. Can you ride, Bob? - Yeah. Sure. - Ah, no, he can't. Not unless I hold him up. That's no good, Cole. Clell. Jim Cummings. Charlie. Bob'll make it. [sighs] Yeah, sure he will. But Jesse's right. We gotta get out of here. They'll be flushing these woods. Go ahead, Frank. I think we'd better scatter anyways. We're in this together. We stay together. No good. Best thing to do is every man for himself. Whatever it is, we gotta move. Best thing you can do is to draw 'em away from here. Maybe you're right, Cole. Be dark in a couple hours. Come on, Jess. We'll make another run, Cole. I'm sorry, Bob. Take it easy, Bob. Here we go. - Cole, why don't you and Jim... - Oh, never mind. This where I'm supposed to sleep? Like it or not, it's safer than outside. Must be a thousand posse men swarming this country looking for us by now. How about the people here on the place? They think I went to New Home to get drunk. - I didn't quit my job. I just took the day off. - That was smart. But suppose somebody comes up here for hay. They won't. I feed the stock. Jess, I wouldn't want any of these people to get hurt. They been white to me, especially the old man and the girl. Oh? There's a girl? They mustn't be hurt, no matter, Jess. You understand. Sure, Frank. I'd like to have found that sack of money those robbers left behind when they held up the train. There's some things money can't buy. Your life. And come right down to it, them fellas found that out. You notice they was glad to let the money go when it come to runnin'. Say, Dave, I forgot to ask you. Have a good time in town last night? Oh, it was all right. By the way, Nick Schimmel stopped by last night. He says they're getting together a big posse to go after them train robbers. - You wanna go with 'em? - No, no posse for me. They were talking about the holdup in town. They figure maybe it was Jesse James. [laughs] That's what August says. I don't think they know what they're talking about. Every time I read the paper I find something about Jesse James. One week he holds up a bank in California. The next week, a train in Pittsburgh. What is he, a flyin' man? Jesse James never held up any train in Pittsburgh. This train yesterday was the first train that was ever held up by any outlaw. Train or bank. What's the difference? Jesse James gets blamed for everything. Me, I ain't believin' there isa Jesse James. Well, I believe it. And you can get $10,000 for catching him, dead or alive. [hoofbeats] - Hello, Andy. - Hi, Steve. - Going hunting? - Man hunting. Getting up a posse. Like to come along? You don't think those bandits are still hanging around here, do you? They've had all night to ride. If I didn't have so much work, I think I'd go along with you. - Dave, why don't you go with them? - I haven't got a gun. - Well, I'll lend you mine. - I'm not very good with a gun. I'd better get at that north 80. Trowbridge, the detective, came in on the train this morning. He's gonna lead the posse. He knows more about Jesse James, they say, than Jesse James's mother. What's your hurry, Dave? Ah, he'd only get in our way if there was any shootin'. - Come on. I'll go with you. - You go along with them. I gotta go back to town, get another bunch of men. Hah! Hah! Hyah! Whoa! I think they're holed up in these rocks. You two boys head around from the north. Wait a minute. Keep clear of those woods. The minute you hear any shootin', why, come on in. Bill! You and Joe go round in from the other side. The rest of us'll go on in and get 'em. There can't be more than five of them altogether, and they're probably pretty badly wounded, judging from the amount of blood they're leaving. Come on. [gunshot] You're surrounded, Jesse! You may as well surrender! Frank! You've got better sense! You're surrounded and outnumbered! Give up! All right! All right! [Trowbridge] Throw out your gun! I can't. [Trowbridge] Well, drop it! The Younger brothers, huh? - Where's the others? - No others. - Where are Frank and Jesse? - I don't know. [man] Say, this one's alive. You're Cole Younger, aren't ya? Yeah. That's all I'm gonna say. Is it? We'll see about that. Drag 'em out of here! Go on! Drag 'em out! - We got them. - Got who? - We shot it out with them and we got 'em. - Not Jesse James. - I still don't believe there's such a person. - Only one of them could talk. He said his name was Cole Younger, but the detective said the other two was his brothers. - You sure they were the Younger brothers? - I just told ya. They're alive, all three of 'em, but they're full of lead. You'll still have to prove it to me. Just a minute, Dave. - You're just the man I want to see. - Yeah? You were in Bregdorf's saloon yesterday. That's right. You had a beer there with another fella. - Yeah. An old friend of mine. - An old friend of yours. They took pictures of them bandits that held up that train yesterday. Doggone, one of them looked like the fella that was with you in the saloon. Who, Steve Brill? He works on the farm over near Barkley. He and I came from the same town. -You lived in Barkley before you came here? -That's right. I was born there. Everybody knows me. If you don't believe Dave, why don't you go over to Barkley and ask them? Well, maybe I will. Sorry to have bothered you. Bye. So long, Mary. John. Dave. I was watching your face while August was talking about the outlaws. What is your real name? I don't suppose it matters anymore. It doesn't matter to me. I'm Frank James. Then you were with them yesterday. Yes. - You've got to get out of here. It isn't safe. - I can't. Not yet. Up with your hands! - August, have you lost your mind? - Stay away! Frank James is gonna get it if he makes a move. Where are your guns? - I don't know what you're talking about. - No? You talked that lunkhead sheriff out of it, but you won't convince me. I know you're Frank James! All right, August. You win. - Keep back! Keep back, or I'll shoot. - August, you fool! [gunshots] - Come on, Frank, let's go. - Frank, please. It's no use, Mary. Mr. Bauer, I amFrank James. Frank Ja... And you? Jesse James. I've got to be going. - I'm going with you. - No, Mary, you can't. Oh, yes, I can. I know you've done wrong, but we'll make a new life together. Mary. Mary, listen. Bee, it looks to me like you don't like my cooking. I'm not very hungry. - Coffee? - Yes, please. You know, Ma, these last few days I... I don't know what I would have done without you. You'd have been all right. 'Sides, the change was good for me. And I wanted to see your house. I'd heard so much about it. You know, it's nice. It's real pretty. - Forgot the sugar. - Oh, I'll get it. It isn't going to change, Bee. You've been reading that same paper for three days now. They're holding something back. There hasn't been any more since this came out. Because there isn't any more. - Oh, Jesse! - Bee. Ma. I'm all right. - Hello, Ma. Hello, Bee. - Frank! I've got a surprise for you. I want you to meet my wife. This is Mary, Ma. Frank. I'm so happy for you. This is Bee. She's lovely, Frank. Frank's told me about you and Jesse, how happy you are. Happy? I hope you'll be happy. Every time Frank leaves the house, you'll wonder when he's coming back. - Bee. - Every time there's a knock on the door, your heart stops. - Every time you pick up the paper, you're afraid. - Bee, stop it! - You'll afraid you'll find he's dead! - No, Jesse, let her say it. That's true. I don't care what you say. Trowbridge doesn't mean a thing to me. He's never even been in smelling distance of us. He got my brother Clell. It was the soldiers got him, wasn't it? What difference does it make who got him? Seems to make a difference to you. Every time you hear something about Trowbridge, you wanna lay low. You young squirt. You haven't got sense enough to know what's good for you. Are you so chickenhearted you have to keep shouting how tough you are? I'm not afraid of any detective, if that's what you mean. Sometime you find it pays to be scared, especially when the law is after you. You're kidding, Jesse. Why, everybody's scared of you. Mention your name to someone, they get white in the face. - Have you mentioned my name anywhere? - No! No, honest, Jesse. I just meant people are afraid of you. He's too green for this business, Charlie. He'll be all right, Jesse. He's got spunk. And he can shoot better than I can right now. Hello, Bee. Got something good for supper? Tell them to get out of my house. Now, Bee, you know you like me around. I'm tired of having this bunch of cutthroats around here. And especially you, Dick Liddil. What you do outside is your business, but this is our home. Sure, Bee. Sure. They just happened to drop by. "They just happened to drop by." The neighbors are already avoiding me because this trash just happens to drop by. - Trash? Now, Bee... - Shut up! When they leave, I'll come back. - I guess I'll be going. - Yeah, me too. Sit down. You can't leave in a body. Go one at a time every five minutes. If you want me tonight, you'll find me at Frank's. Trash, huh? -Good enough to help her husband get the money she spends. -Shut your mouth, Dick. She's right. She's right about us. - Talk for yourself. - I am. Gettin' kinda big for your britches, ain't ya? Or maybe Jesse's been tellin' you what a great fighter your brother was. Was. - Don't you say anything about my brother. - Who's gonna make me stop? Now look here, fellas. You can't... Get your hat. Get your hat! - Get out of the way, Charlie. - Dick, listen! Get out of the way, and I'll make him get on his knees. Just because Jesse said something about nerve, you think I haven't got any. - Draw! - [gunshot] [body falls] The neighbors. It was him or me, wasn't it? Wasn't it? Sure, Dick. He drew on you. Yeah, sure. He drew on me. I hadto kill him. I guess they didn't hear. You saw him draw on me, didn't ya? Didn't ya? Yes, Dick, but... Jesse... He won't believe me. He's Clell's brother. Just because Clell rode with him during the war, he thinks the sun rose and set on him. You'll back me up, won't ya, say he drew on me? Sure, Dick. Sure. I never did like Ed anyway. Just the same, you'd better get his body out of here before Jesse comes back. Yeah. Yeah, I'll get it... We won't tell Jesse anything about this. And then when Ed doesn't show up, Jesse'll need a new man. He'll have to take me into the gang. Yeah. Yeah. Gentlemen, we're out of business. I have here a letter from the Bankers Association discharging us and another one from the railroad companies giving us 90 days notice. Two miserable outlaws hiding in holes in the ground and sneaking through the night have beaten us. They've destroyed a detective agency with offices in eight cities and 300 men on the payroll! A thousand sheriffs of a thousand counties have failed to get these same outlaws. I'm not a sheriff, and neither are you. You're supposed to be a trained detective, a picked man. I remember you, McGuire. You were one of the brave lads who surrounded the James house one dark night, weren't you? One of seven or eight exactly like you who attacked an old woman and caused her to lose an arm and thereby gain the sympathy of the entire country for her and her murderous sons! I should have fired you then and there! You can have your job. Get out. Get out, all of ya! I'm sick of the sight of ya! My ears are ringing with the silly excuses you've be giving me for years, how you just missed Jesse James here, how you come to just miss him there, everywhere. Get out! Get out! [man] Read all about it! Get your paper here! Outlaw captured! Read all about it! One of James gang captured! Read all about it! Big outlaw taken! Read all about it! One of Jesse James's men captured! Read all about it! One of James gang captured! Read all about it! One of Jesse James's men captured! Read all about it! Get your paper here! Read all about it! - One of James's men captured! Read all about it! - Let me have one. Read all about it! One of James gang captured! Read all about it! Get your paper here! Read all about it! One of James gang captured! Read all about it! Listen, Dick. I'll make a deal with you. There's a $10,000 reward for him. You tell me where he is, and I'll see that you get the money, every single dollar of it. I don't know what you're talking about. I never saw Jesse James in all my life. The sheriff didn't capture you. You gave yourself up. You came to him of your own volition and surrendered, didn't you? Jesse James was after you, huh? Yeah. And you were more afraid of him than you were of the law. You know so much, what are you wasting your time on me for? Go out and get Jesse. I don't know where he is. Well, you won't find him where he was yesterday, that's for sure. That I know. Don't you feel too safe in here. Make no mistake about Jesse James. He's a desperate man. He's the most dangerous man in this country. If he wants to get you, these bars won't protect you. Get out! Go on, get out of here. Let me alone. That's why you surrendered, wasn't it, Dick? You knew Jesse would get you, no matter where you went, how fast or how far. You're a dead man, Dick, unless I get Jesse James. I don't know where he is. I told you that. It's the truth. - If I knew, I'd... - A pardon, Dick. Your life and a pardon. The minute I get my hands on Jesse James, you get a pardon. Think of it, boy. Your freedom and all that reward money to spend. - You'll never get him alive. - Who said anything about getting him alive? I gave up that idea years ago. The Fords. Charlie and Bob Ford. They'll know where he's at. Bob Ford's your man. [knocking] - [knocking] - Who is it? [Trowbridge] Open up! Who are you? A friend of yours, Dick Liddil, sent me over to see you. - Which one of you is Bob? - I am. I'm Major Trowbridge. - What are you trying to pull? - Not a thing. Not a thing. Your friend Liddil told me that you might be the right man for a certain job. But after seeing you, I doubt very much if you'll do. Get to the point, mister. All right. I can offer $10,000 cash and a full pardon for a man who's got nerve enough to take care of Jesse James. But like I said, after seeing you, I doubt very much if you'll do. [door opens, closes] Jess. Jess, we've been lucky. We've taken a thousand chances, and we've won. But to try to break into a big city jail and kill Dick Liddil, you haven't got a chance. - He killed Ed Miller. - And we killed his brother Clell. Yes, you and I, Jess. If he hadn't been our friend, he'd be alive today. You've been doing some strange talking lately. Everything I say you're against. I'm fed up, if you want to know. I'm tired of moving from house to house, town to town, city to city. I'm tired of running and dodging. I'm tired of being a thief. Jess, we've never enjoyed one cent of the money we've stolen. Well, I'm through. Mary and I are going to Europe. When we come back, I'm gonna settle down in one place. I want to be able to look people in the eye. I want to be able to look at my wife. I've got a wife too. And is she any happier than my wife? Does she like the life she leads? No, I don't. I don't like it at all. Do you, Jesse? Let's not go into that again, Bee. I've had about all I can take from Frank. You won't be hearing any more. Good-bye, Bee. Good-bye, Jess. Think it over, will you? Come on, Mary. - Hello, Frank. Didn't know you were here. - Just going. It's all right, boys. It's just a little family argument. Sit down. I'll be right with you. Family squabble. - Let's get out of here. - What's the matter with you, Charlie? Sit down. You haven't got any more sand in you than that chickenhearted Dick Liddil. I rode on two jobs with Jesse. I've seen him in action. Dick had a right to be scared of him. Is he so fast on the draw? I can handle a gun myself. Jesse doesn't scare me. A gun? What for? There's no need of it. You saw in this morning's paper that Trowbridge's luck ran out. He can't help you. So Trowbridge got himself killed by a cheap pickpocket. What of it? I don't need him. There's still a reward for Jesse. [footsteps] Well, boys, I finally made up my mind. I'm through. I'm going to Europe. - What? - You'll never hear of Jesse James again. He's gone, disappeared, finished. I'm packing right now. We leave tonight. In two days I'll be in New York and then on a boat. Where'd I leave those suitcases? Oh, yes. In the back. Jesse. You can't go outside wearing that gun. The neighbors. That's right. I forgot. Well, I might as well get used to going around without it. [door opens] [door closes] [door opens, closes] Boys, I haven't felt so good in years. Frank and I had a little talk. He was right. So was Ma. Yeah, a year in Europe oughta change my whole outlook. If you're quittin', Jesse, I think I'll take over. You, Bob? You think you're big enough for that? Yeah, I think I'm big enough. - [footsteps] - Let's go. Jesse! Jesse. Bee, I'm sorry. Oh, don't talk. Hasn't been much of a life for you. Oh, Jesse. Jesse. Jesse? Jesse!
