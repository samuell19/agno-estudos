I find it a very odd book, it tells us at length about a pathology. He speaks of spectacle as if there was no history. History…what about Napoleon? That was a real spectacle! Just a second! - Or Louis XIV! - Right! Real spectacle! We haven’t read the same book! I’ll never ever work, even if I’m hard up, never! So he satanizes spectacle… Which supposedly… Which supposedly all powerful, falsifies everything! - He tells us… - Please, I read the book- - Seems like another. - It’s what I read. I can even quote. He says secrecy is spreading. Whereas I think things are ever more open. He tells us… He tells us history is disappearing… And why? Because it hasn’t unfolded to his liking since May ’68! And what’s more… He tells us truth is disappearing as if it never had in 2000 years! It is now conjured away by an economic system. He tells us democracy is breaking down. He’s right. He says that, and yet one feels democracy is advancing all over. All you have to do is read the papers! In Yugoslavia, Algeria, Chile, and so on… So, Mr Debord has written a very interesting book… But he hasn’t read the history books. Nor does he read the papers! And, just let me finish… He puts it all down to one big conspiracy. That’s the weakness of the book. Yes, that’s its weakness, but… His paranoia sees conspiracy everywhere. But why do I not like this talented, though somewhat jargonesque book? Because, though he doesn’t say so, it legitimizes violence. It legitimizes violence because it tells us that the world, the conspiracy, we’re entering is horrible. That there is no democracy, so why not simply… And I can’t accept that! His art and his time I His art Old Paris is no more (the form of a city changes faster, alas, than a mortal’s heart). One thing I hate is the word: “commercial” applied to a film… You always hear: “it takes but a stroke of the magic wand to make a script …commercial”. A film works when it is made with the utmost sincerity and when this sincerity touches the greatest number of people. Guy Debord has made very little art, but the little he has made is extreme. in 1952, he showed that cinema could be reduced to a white screen Then to this black screen. Debord has since maintained the same indifference to the tastes and judgements of public opinion. And he has been accused of many other immoralities and in particular to have almost always been rather uninterested when it came to easy money... regularly obeying the principle: One doesn't look a gift horse in the mouth. Memories the arrangement of words that leads to discourse transforms something in the world order by an action on conscience: the one which formulates it and the one which hears it. It is the breach through which a moment of eternity is engulfed in a world that is moving obscenely towards its ruin. What distance are we? "What a tragedy! And who can we rely on? Ardor, good will, good disposition, I dare say were on our side. But within a half-hour the manoeuvres of the King of Prussia made the cavalry and infantry submit; all retreated without fleeing, but without ever looking back..." Never work Transcending art Realisation of philosophy This fine band of hoodlums, his constant entourage, have also been a great influence on his excesses. II His time Never have we seen the Pont Neuf so Since the magician Christo made it appear in making it disappear; An ephemeral sculpture now carved in memory. “And now I will attempt to be as anti-televisual in form as I have been in content” 2000 kms south of Moscow in the heart of Soviet Central Asia the Aral is the world’s 4th largest land-locked sea. In 30 years, its surface has diminished by one third, its volume by two thirds and its level has dropped 14 meters. It’s dying of thirst and if nothing halts the process in 10 years it’ll be wiped off the map. I will write down my thoughts in orderly fashion, in a pattern devoid of confusion. If they are right, the first to come will be the consequence of the others. That is the true order. Mommy, if you can hear me… And I think you can… Pray that I may walk again… That these people continue to help me… Mommy I adore you… I love you daddy, my brother too… Goodbye, mommy… …This Andean girl, inexorably sucked up by a mud slide caused by an erupting volcano, has given media operators around the world an occasion to discuss in ethical terms about a deontology they might perhaps choose to impose on themselves in certain extreme cases: Should such images be shown? Or why should one deprive oneself from showing them? Professionals have all firmly concluded that there is nothing to hide from the misfortunes of the world. No false sentimentality on the part of the public should prevent us from projecting what we had the merit of filming on this occasion. And all the more so when, for once, it's something real. The media want to prove how they are everywhere, and to the utmost point, attached to the truth. And well convinced that a detail, looked at very closely, is usually a perfect and unambiguous model of the truth. Cinderella has just flung her own partner at her opponent. But it’s not over yet. With this back somersault from the top rope she could’ve broken her spine on the barriers. Yet competing at this level, wrestlers are in a trance taking terrible risks. Cinderella returns to her tiny 10 sq meter room. If she wins tomorrow’s bout She’ll be able to rent a real apartment. If I win a championship title I’ll earn a lot more money. That’s why I have to go all out for tomorrow’s bout. Oil, beneath the Paris basin, is nothing new. But this time they’re not prospecting in a wheatfield but 2 kms from the castle of Versailles, In the “arboretum”. The arboretum, is a huge reserve of over 2000 species of trees partly open to the public who can now see the drilling team at work. Sometimes on Sundays… What has been so badly built must be demolished even faster. Here we are in Bavaria where acid rain has ravaged the forest. We thought economy was a science; we were obviously wrong. We now know it would neither be the first, nor the last, of the enemy’s sciences to prove itself deceptive. 1933 was one of the most sinister dates in the history of this century; which has not known many good ones. From Dallas Texas, the flash, apparently official, President Kennedy died at 1 pm, central standard time. 2 o'clock eastern standard time, some 38 minutes ago. “The democratic” state has become stranger. The warlord who ruled in Peking at that time justly considered that “the fate of the party and the state was at stake in Tiananmen Square”. He has therefore acted accordingly and still reigns there, perfectly insensitive to all the ideologies of recent media fashions. This worrying prospect reminds Muscovites of 2 years ago when same armored cars surrounded the same white house Under orders from the putschists. Yet tonight, it’s Boris Yeltsin who’s playing though calling out the armored cars of the red berets and the crack commandos equipped with grenades and night-sight. Muscovites prepare for crisis. at the gates of this suburban factory. Employees are perplexed… “Why call the people to arms?”, he says. Army and police who turn a blind eye, every morning corpses on the pavements, houses torched… Most shops in the capital remain closed. Intimidation remains the sole arm Of Duvallier’s followers to prevent elections. Anger, indignation, crime and incomprehension this would-be democratic march turned to nightmare. In the face of death We will remain standing! Long live free Algeria! Down with fundamentalism! The unverifiable world - What year did this book appear? - 1883… Right, good… 1883 is what century? - What century are we living in? - The 20th… So 1883 is what century? If it’s not the 20th it’s the…? The 18th! - The 19th… - Right, the 19th. So Zola was born in the 19th century, But in which year? - In 1840! - Right, in 1840… His book was published in 1883. I mean, it’s not that it’s a drag… It’s just that we need it. Our exam is not going To be just about sewing. There’ll also be general culture… So we have to know a little of everything, not just sewing, lots of stuff. And I like that, especially French. It’s good to have that stuff in your head. Corentin’s in my class… What you gonna do later? What job? I wanna join the army, get military training. Maybe the Air Force… I dunno…go to war. - You like war? - Yeah. All those dead don’t bother you? What do you mean? We all have to die… In the school year 1991-92… Over 100 teachers were attacked while doing their job. And here I’m only speaking about 3 suburbs of Paris: Hauts-de-Seine, Seine Saint-Denis a~nd Val-de-Marne. Who has changed? Schools, pupils or teachers? 10 years ago fear and aggression were unheard of in schools. Yet the rot had set in. Since then, violence has come to school and not just in the suburbs, not just in Paris. Friday, 27 November, on my usual round of the school yard an individual was waiting here to take me to task over the fact that I’d supposedly denounced him… Street violence has also brought verbal violence to school. Vulgarity and insult is a sport unto itself in the corridors and classes of most suburban schools. Here in the east suburbs of Paris it’s “motherfucker!” which as it happens rhymes with my surname. It’s not right… I’m called an “old whore!”… Every possible insult to the female sex. We just let it go… Certain pupils practically spit in the face of teachers and we do nothing! Shouting at your mates, if I were a teacher I’d be in depression! They obligue us to keep them, we have to. The teachers are on top and we’re on the bottom. - Isn’t that normal? - No, it’s not. Sure, they might be older but there’s things we should have the right to do. In supervised study, after our homework, can we have some fun? No, we can’t say a word, they just want us to work! “He who cannot command respect” as the old adage says, “won’t be heard”. Yes, some have threatened me with baseball bats… but I wasn’t hurt… I remember with my colleagues we’d never walk the same route home two evenings running. To avoid them. Go get sucked off! I know you’re dying for it! You want it? Again! Your answering machine stinks of shit! You fucker! Fucker…! And when you come home in the evening… really wanting to forget about school, you listen to your messages and hear the likes of that knowing they’re pupils…You feel… like you’ve been trapped, that they’ve found you and that it’ll never end. The buses don’t stop anymore, - in front of the school? - Right. Why? We’re attacked. Attacked, so we don’t stop. Mas du Taureau, Minguettes, Aulnay 3000, Val Fourré… Teaching is a high risk job in these suburbs termed “difficult areas” by the National Education Board. Teachers who risk going there are paid a bonus. They ought to line up outside when the bell goes except they never do. I come in with 4 or 5 pupils and then the others drift in when they’ve finished chatting or amusing themselves outside. So it takes me 10 minutes to get them in. I have to stay by the door, as it’s locked on the inside so I have to open it. Then I have to get them to sit down. Because…they won’t off their own bat. Sometimes you have to sit them down one by one. However long it takes… Because I can’t begin my lesson if pupils are standing. Then you have to get silence. Quiet please! You’re in class! As soon as I entered they quietened down. Yet I saw… 3 dancing on the desks down the back with a boom-box blaring eating, dancing… While the teacher was glued to the board talking to herself! On the brink of tears! Incapable. We were sitting on a bomb about to go off. They burnt the school. They set fire to part of the school. This floor was saved, as it didn’t burn. In some schools problems of integration are intensified having 30 to 40 different ethnic groups to deal with. What a failure for the educational system. For society itself. Proof of the knock-on effect by which street violence ends up in the schoolyard: shortly after the Vaulx-en-Velin riots attacks on teachers there increased. Is it normal to hit teachers? Yeah, if they hit us. They get what’s coming to them. How old are you? I’m 15. -14… -Yeah, sure! Thirteen and a half. - All in junior high? - Yeah. My principal hit me… ‘cos I can’t read, I’m too ashamed. So he took me to his office and hit me. So my big brother came to his office and sorted him out. - I swear! - He did that? Yeah I swear, he doesn’t know my big brother. - He got into trouble over that? - No. He doesn’t know my big brother, he’s in the army. They couldn’t find him. - You find that normal? - Sure! They pick on Arabs, it’s not on… Do I insult you French? But kids ought to work in school. Like I said, I don’t like reading. He said I should, but I don’t want to. What’ll you do later if you can’t read? I dunno, sport… Go on welfare! At Jean-Jaurès, a petrol-bomb in the principal’s office. Setting fire to things is pretty routine. 8 days later, explosion in the toilets of Bobigny high-school. A home-made bomb… I’ve spoken so far abut unarmed aggression, but I’ve seen teachers injured with arms… The most modern developments of historical reality have illustrated very precisely how Thomas Hobbes thought man’s life must have been before he knew civilization and the state: lonely, dirty, devoid of pleasure, dimwitted, brief. Radio Paris is lying… Radio Paris is German. Today the hour of Nazism has become that of all Europe. Don’t forget, tonight we switch to Winter Time. At 3 a.m. it’s 2 a.m. So before you go to bed put your clocks back one hour. Tonight we lose an hour, at 2 a.m. it’ll be 3 a.m. Ladies and gentlemen, we interrupt this program to bring you important news. Word has just been received from the Atomic Energy Commision that due to a change in the wind direction the residue from this morning's atomic detonation is drifting in the direction of St. George. It is suggested that everyone remain indoors for one hour or until further notice. There is no danger. First there was Hiroshima… Everyone thought it didn’t concern us. It had no repercussions. Then there was Chernobyl. Everyone thought it would go away. The government told us: “Everything’s fine”. Eat the mushrooms, go for walks. There’s no problem! Five years have passed. Chernobyl has entered every household. The G7’s gift to the Ukraine: the means to complete this new nuclear power-plant. But to replace Chernobyl, 7% of the national grid, more is needed. Thus Ukraine is driving a hard bargain. Mikhail Umanev says it’ll take 30 years to wipe Chernobyl off the map. The boss of Ukraine Nuclear thinks rebuilding national energy policy will require at least $5 billion and saving the Ukraine means 6 new reactors. In today’s declaration, the G7 has given the Ukraine new loans amounting to $3.5 billion. In 30 seconds we’ll be launching LCI the first non-stop French news channel. LCI, as those with Cable TV are about to discover, will be a non-stop news channel with bulletins on the hour and on the half hour. A round-the-clock news channel meaning that events which require it get the on-the-air coverage they need; flexibility in the service of news. And of course it will be the channel of open debate. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1… Go, LCI! No one felt they were hurting others, or sleeping on the job. Or that financial interests were outweighing patients’ interests. No one felt that. Honestly, sincerely… It was only later we discovered the seriousness of the illness. And we didn’t know how to treat it. Perhaps we could and should have acted faster… But today we must show absolute solidarity with these people. These ill men, women and children. We must give them better compensation, better treatment. Efforts must be made here, and I’ll do my utmost. Salaried workers have the right to vote. When it is said that transfusion… has become totally safe, that’s not quite true, as there’s still a slight risk …involved. Because we know this risk exists should we ban transfusions? I’d just like to ask our viewers… Risk of AIDS and other illnesses? Yes… What would you do today as Health Minister? If you had to make a choice… Either I ban all transfusions, or I don’t, knowing that there are slight risks… of contamination by transfusion… available in French hospitals. What would you do? You’d weigh up the risks. And you’d weigh up how much each of us would stand to earn. You’d try to evaluate the extent of possible contamination. And once you’ve weighed the risks you must decide. What would you decide, today? Knowing that the risk is… minimal, but real. At the time, the situation was somewhat similar. And then the risk became, big, huge… - You weren’t aware of the risks? - No, back then we didn’t realize the extent of it. It’s a risk which is always there, it’s the risk of life. And in that regard, I hold myself wholly responsible. It’s a risk which can be… terrible, tragic, but which is… the measure and the difficulty of holding office. Salaried workers have the right to vote. At the source of dadaism, one finds the boxer-poet Arthur Cravan who was, during the First World War, “deserter of seventeen nations”. Neo-dadaism is state dadaism which only obtains some small shock value by producing itself in national galleries. Nuclear power likes to be surrounded by images of its favorite animal. Magritte would have had the opportunity to write "This is not a sheep". He complained he wasn’t sleeping enough. Now he had to cut short his holiday Silvio Berlusconi has reason to be irritable. His majority is dwindling daily the Lire is falling, dragging his empire with it. Many people are currently acting against National interest so I have had to cut short my holiday. This ceremony has been filled with unusual sights images Pierre Bérégovoy would like to have seen sights his loved ones will have seen. E.Balladur, Prime Minister, R.Monory, President of the Senate Philippe Séguin, Chief Whip V.G. d’Estaing, C.Pasqua… P.Maurois, L.Fabius, M.Rocard, all on the same bench. The entire French political establishment gathered in grief. On the other side, the former Prime Minister’s family his brother, his children and grandchildren. Up front, Mrs Bérégovoy flanked by François and Danielle Mitterrand. A highly emotional ceremony… the homily, by the bishop of Nevers, Monsignor Moutel on the theme of mystery. No one… knows the heart of man… Only God fathoms the secret of our lives… and the mystery… that dwells within each of us… No one may judge his fellow… The details of the ceremony were decided by the family who wished to hear Rossini’s Agnus Dei so dear to Pierre Bérégovoy. Paris is overflowing, not with water from the Seine but with enthusiasm for art. The culture of the past is the object of universal consensus and an egalitarian admiration. But in each of its concrete expressions, it often ends up being as inauthentic as today’s reconstructed Pont-Neuf. Their daily diet in this city under siege is the Barnes Collection or the Mona Lisa’s smile. One smells cancer in Rue Daguerre. On the right bank it’s the same story The watchwords: patience and queuing. One smells cancer in Rue de Buci. We’re lucky, it’s not too cold today. It’s the chance for my kids to see something exceptional. Cancer is refunded by the health service. Some jostling in the crowd, but no violence. A few arrests, the occasional banner spells out support for democratic reform… the slogans are still the same: “We want freedom”, “We want democracy”. Eulogy for dialectics: It must all be played out over again. I’d just like to prove to you that it’s a total …set up. There is no way that the 10 a.m. edition of Le Monde could yesterday run entire pages with interviews, descriptions of what’d happened 1 hour before at my home without it having been organized. - Organized by who? - By those who are out to distract me from what I want to do today which is to speak of youth unemployment, Europe of my conception of human relations… But I can’t do that, because I spend my time… justifying myself before endless attacks coming so hard and fast that I think someone’s out to prevent me getting to the 12th. Let me give you the latest… Last week, they contested the status of my boat. Yet it’s had the same status for the past 10 years. It’s had it since it was built. - There was a complaint… - 10 years on! 10 years later, they question its status. - A complaint… - No, it flies the French flag one of the few on the French Riviera to do so. Most others are registered in Panama, S. America, or Bahamas. Because it’s French they’re after me. I mean, why this sudden complaint from the customs concerning a 10-years-old boat? I’ll tell you why. Because last week, it was my boat. This week my furniture. And next week it’ll be the removal of my parliamentary immunity… A renewed demand. There have been 3 since the 5th Republic, I’ve had 3 in 9 months. - What will you do? - Do? Defend myself, by telling people what they’ve already understood: My honor is at stake… What really hurts is the O.M dossier. As for the rest, they’re mere accusations regarding how I made my money. Yet, I would rather that… than to be suspected of having pocketed public money. Every time Bernard Tapie speaks of himself, one wonders what dishonesty he could ever have been reproached for. I take this occasion to reiterate before you… in the name of the P.L.O… and the Palestinian people… our commitment to these peace agreements… and their application… We will pursue them with firm determination, and in all sincerity with our new and dear neighbor… Mr Prime Minister of Israel… and Mr Minister of Foreign Affairs of Israel… you are our new neighbors. Before, we were cousins. I and my brother Fayçal are both sons of Abraham. May God bless him… Yes, we are children of Abraham… you are children of Abraham… We are therefore cousins and we should now… be colleges…. friends and neighbors Not just for us, but for the whole region… and for the good of humanity. Three media barons rethink current World events and have us look in at length. Tonight, politics, in good company… A political climate which seems rather odd one both serene and tense… No political daggers drawn, but insinuations nonetheless like those voiced in parallel yesterday by Simone Veil and Michel Rocard. The new politico-literary salons of Paris. Simone Veil who favors raising social security contributions… Surprised, Philippe? I think she, like everyone, was surprised by the size of the Social Security deficit. - Surprised, you think? - Yes, the Prime Minister… - Surprised, really? - Yes, I think she was. And that the Prime Minister had made a more modest calculation… Here the excellence of each is confirmed by the endless admiring nods of the other two. …of the deficit. And so her situation is rather odd, because her counterweight here in none other than Charles Pasqua they are the two who stand out… - With different approaches… - Indeed. So, she has a problem, she’s also the urban portfolio, but for now the French are expecting her to settle the Social deficit, meaning that on the urban front, the parliamentary debate begins tomorrow, she’ll probably be a bit cash-strapped for her budget. So it’s not an easy situation. Yet I didn’t find her remarks vague… I found her extremely prudent, like her leader. I suspect the Interior Minister will be less so when he voices his problems. But I didn’t… really understand when you said that the climate was rather odd. “Cough it up! We’ll see what comes out”. It’s just this mix of serenity and tension… I mean, the situation remains worrying. Yes, but everyone knew that. What continues to… totally amaze me, is that for months on end we’ve been told that the economic situation was good, whereas now the French seem to have suddenly discovered, seemingly without surprise, that it’s catastrophic. And it leaves them as unruffled as before. I find that good, yet one might question what I wouldn’t call apathy, but… acceptance of an effectively unusual situation. And you Serge? Regarding Simone Veil or the overall situation? On the overall climate which colors, if you like, what ministers are saying. I think the elections were a reflection of that. There was both rejection and hardly much enthusiasm for… an alternative government. So I think Edouard Balladur’s skillfulness… his political intelligence was to interpret that…politically in the balance he found, in this presentation he made of his government and its policy in that spirit of a moderate measured Right. So I think that pleases public opinion…. It ties in well with the overall picture… Act Up on parade! We’re making war on AIDS! A small apartment near Place de la Republique: the headquarters of ACT UP. Today, the association has 200 active members and 500 supporters. Self-financed, it refuses subsidies in order to maintain its freedom. For once someone is doing something symbolic for AIDS which will have more impact than AFLS messages. You would rather remove a condom from the Obelisk than install… You would rather remove it -it was removed- than install distributors of condoms in high-schools or syringes in the city. So what’s your answer? With the pill; no drinking, no smoking. Are you kidding? Who is the Minister of Health in France? The Minister of the Interior, of Justice? Pasqua, is that it? So now we know! No I won’t stop! It’s World AIDS Day and once more France is blind stupid! All the Ministry can do is mess up! So, you’ve better things to do than care for AIDS victims! Immune defense is a thing uf the past on earth. The Boutboul family reunited! Mother says son-in-law was investigating her involvement. All the journalists told me! Why? Why? I’m really happy to see you. Why couldn’t we have been reunited without all that… without Jacques having to die? Why? Yes it’s surprising that a father would decide… to vanish from her daughter’s life? Yes, but a man of 45 doesn’t think like a man of 74. When I was younger I had more go, more dynamism I wanted to be independent and not weighed down… by family life… I felt it stifled my freedom. So when you divorced you broke off all contact? Yes, when I separated… from Elisabeth, I saw no more of Dari. Though I occasionally saw Elisabeth. Who told me about the problems she was having over the years… The problems Dari was having with her school-mates… So I said, “Tell her I’m dead so there’ll be no more talk”… - What’d you do last night? - Last night! We saw a 30-foot-tall giant! Telling the future in a big crystal ball! And then the giant shrank beside a huge boat! Then the boat ran aground near a volcano! And the volcano changed into a mystery isle! - Are you both feeling okay? - An island, I swear! “Loto Fantasy Nights” Don’t wait to be told! “Loto Fantasy Nights” Show tonight at 22.30 at Le Touquet!

Responding to your company’s specific approach guaranteeing quality service a partner you can really talk to bringing your beneficial, profitable solutions: such are the advantages of The Regional Penitentiary Services Board. This D.R.S.P. appears to be the most legitimate heir to factory work of old. - Why too late? - Because we’re snowed under. There are far too many cases. Too many new arrivals. We found 800 bodies by the roadside this morning. Upon arriving here, another 100. By the time we deal with those bodies, there’ll be another 100. And to rehydrate people with unfamiliar personnel… and 2 or 3 expatriates, it’s beyond us. How many doctors are you? For now, we’re 2 doctors here… and 3 expatriate nurses… - That’s all… - Totally insufficient. Yes, given the scale, whether we’re here or not, has little impact. You’ve saved some? I hope so, yes… but tomorrow there’ll be twice as many dead… Bill Clinton, who arrived last night didn’t miss his daily jog despite the 8 a.m. 25-degree heat. In the summer of 1994, the leading democratic powers who, under the name of the G7, will collectively decide upon the most important administrative aspects of the new global society triumphantly enter Naples.
