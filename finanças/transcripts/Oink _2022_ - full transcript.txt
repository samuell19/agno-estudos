I really wonder about the result of this... I really wonder what today's result will be. Such great sausages. I've seen lots of sausages where I think: Oh, delicious. I'm really looking forward to today. Great sausages... I didn't have a lot of breakfast so I can eat more sausages. Understand? It's so much fun. Hello, my name is Freddy Willekes. I'm in Moppel at the King Sausage Contest... organized by the society for meat products from fresh pigs. That sounds tasty, doesn't it? This year it's gonna be very exciting again because we're really anxious to know: Who's going to be this year's King Sausage? The big moment has arrived. There are only two butchers left. The jury doesn't judge on taste alone, the appearance and cooking count as well. Yeah, these sausages seem to go down well. The last sausages... What is this? Rat's tails! Rat's tails! The sausages are full of rat's tails. But that's impossible! I made those sausages myself! You dirty scoundrel! You put those rat's tails in my sausages! Whatever gave you that idea? - You cheat. Things are getting completely out of hand. Stop it! You are both disqualified. For the next 25 years! Never before, ladies and gentlemen, not once in all those 75 years... has anything like this happened. This is appalling. This means that these two butchers are banned from competition... until the 100th edition, you hear it right... the 100th King Sausage of the Century! OINK WHO WILL BE KING SAUSAGE OF THE CENTURY? 100TH EDITION Have we got eggs? - Yes, check. Milk. - Check. Flour. - Check. Syrup, let's see. Yes, check. Icing sugar. - Check. Are we missing anything? Sausages. - With pancakes? Best combination there is! - Why? I'm a vegetarian! You don't have to eat them, do you? Babs? - How sweet. I want one for my birthday! Bye, sweet doggie. I'll race you to the butcher's. Tijn, wait. - No. I'm faster. - No way. Am too. Sorry, ma'am. - Careful! Sorry. - Go the sidewalk! Told you. Who will be king sausage of the century? Who would want to turn cute little piggies into sausages? Duh, a butcher, maybe? This is madness! All those dead animals lying there?! Hello, children. How can I help you? Stop this crue... - Four pork sausages, please. Good choice. I'll grind fresh ones for you. No, don't. We don't want your freshly-ground dead animals. Here you are, lovely children. Thank you, I'll give them a decent burial. Babs, stop acting so... What? My trophy. You... - Run! Hey, wait! Come back, you! Hurry! Come here! I'll put you in the meat grinder. Watch it. This way! This is a good exercise, people. Stay in line! Stay in line! I think we lost him. Got it, this is mine now! My skateboard! Back, run. - Stay here, rascals. Go to your owner. What are they up to? - I haven't got a clue. In their cabin. They want to sleep there and cook. So, what do they cook? - I'd rather not know. There, some extra vitamins. Eat them, OK? Yeah, yeah. Bye now, darling. Another word for storm? Let me see... Hurricane! - Yes... No, it should have seven letters, hurricane has nine. In that case I can't help. Ciao! No, that's... No. What? Mr. Tuitjes? Hey, Tijn, do you think he can find us here? Of course not. He doesn't know where you live. - You never know. ...see how it's here, because there... Who is that? - Is it butcher Smak? It was terrible. No, some old cowboy. And worse. And then a huge storm arrived... that blew my house to pieces. It was a real tornado. - Yes, that's it. Tornado. Is Margreet not at home? That's odd, she was here just a minute ago. Greetje? Greetje? Greetje? I'm not here. Oh, come on, Greetje, you can't do that. He's your... Yes, I know who he is! - Margreet! There you are. You were hiding in the cucumbers. Why? Who is that man? I don't know... So, I was wondering... if I could stay here for a while. As the saying goes: A family in the hand is worth two storms in the sky. I don't have a spare room. Can't you stay in a hotel? Or in that lovely little cabin. This looks just perfect. Wait a minute. This happens to be our cabin. No one can come in here just like that. Not even your dear old grandpa? Grandpa? - Yes. Babs, meet your grandpa Tuitjes. From America? - The one and only. Alive and kicking! Unbelievable... - Greetje... What smells so good? Fine pancake by the look of it. Something is missing, though. A nice, juicy sausage. This is ridiculous. I wonder what's inside that heavy suitcase. A big secret, I bet. And we're gonna find out what it is. Put this away. And this one like that. There, that looks a lot cosier. Beat it, children. I'm taking a shower. The nerve! To take our cabin like that. - As if it's his cabin. He is your grandpa, you know. That man isn't my grandpa all of a sudden! - That's what I just said! What are you doing in my garden? Removing slugs. They're eating everything! Oh, that's nice, sweeties. What's wrong? - Nothing. Big sausage, fat sausage, juicy sausage, spicy sausage, farmer sausage... This is absurd. Tornado, tornado... He's on our doorstep, as if nothing had happened! Babs's birthday wish list I don't know either. Maybe he wants to make amends. - Make amends? The nerve! Fried sausage, grilled sausage, blood sausage Sausages are my paradise. Now grandpa will sleep nicely, don't you think so? But hurry up. - I will. This is from our own garden. It's mashed cauliflower. It's healthier than potatoes. Is the meat still in the oven? - No meat allowed in this house. Care to know why? - Well... I'd like to know. Because eating animals is barbaric. Has it ever occurred to you that they're kept in tiny cages? Or that they're stuffed with hormones just to get you a bigger steak on your plate? And I haven't even mentioned the chickens... Greetje dear, I think your father got the message. Of course. As the saying goes: An honourable man eats as many seasonal veggies as he can. Oh, my God. That's a lovely painting. Who painted it? Well, that's a real... - Mahobie. Bought it at an auction. And that nice vase? Also from an auction? No, that's Margreet's hobby. She made it herself. Well done, Margreet. Yes, she started doing that as a therapy, but then she... And a good cook as well, Margreet. Delicious, right Babs? I can't see anything. Is he in bed already? There he is. Just wait till he's gonna sleep in his slimy bed. What a mess. - He can stay in my room, can't he? I'm not going to discuss it any further. But the cabin is ours, we were going to sleep there! Babs, this was my decision and that's that. But why? What did I just say? Time to go to sleep. If I'm forced to give up my cabin I am entitled to know why! I just don't want him staying in the house, all right? But why? Grandpa Tuitjes is a... Well, he's a bit of a peculiar father. Now go to sleep, OK? What is so peculiar about him? - One day your grandpa simply vanished. And now he's back. I'm not up to it. But why did he leave? Well, I don't know. Your mother died and your father walked out on you. That's just stupid! Yes, that's really stupid. Fortunately Aunt Christine was there. Go to sleep now. - Sleep tight. I hope he'll head back to America again tomorrow. Yes, that would be nice. Both professional and amateur sausage makers can take part in the King Sausage Contest. So if you think you can make this century's best sausage... please register. You have until the end of this week. Morning! - Good morning, did you sleep well? Like a log! Together with my new friends. Ever played sluggleboard? - Sluggleboard? Shuffleboard with slugs. It's a game I invented in Eastern Siberia. Have you been to Eastern Siberia? - Oh yes, your grandpa has been around. But there wasn't very much to be seen in Eastern Siberia. Because the entire country was littered with slugs. And you know what most people did to solve a slug plague? No. - Scatter salt. A bit of salt and then they bubble, crackle and dissolve altogether. But that's sad! - Terribly sad. I thought so too. I couldn't bear the look of it. But your grandpa Tuitjes is a true animal lover. That is why I invented shuffleboard with slugs: sluggleboard. And you know what: it became so popular... that people stopped scattering salt on slugs. And because they were so busy playing sluggleboard... they started to drink less vodka too. That really is a brilliant idea. I always say: sluggleboard is good for both humans and slugs. Are you going to tell him or shall I? Mister Tuitjes, we have something to say... - Nice cabin, don't you think, Grandpa? Yep! I love this cabin! I'll give a demonstration. Ready, Sjakie, here you go. That's great. Can I try? Take Jopie. And there goes Jopie at 20 km an hour. Will he make it? Will he make it? Yeah, he made it. You really have to try it too. - What's in that suitcase? The slugs are tired now. Time to go and play outside. Why did you do that? We were having such a good time! We were going to send grandpa away, remember? But no, you suddenly had to play sluggleboard. And you couldn't help asking what was in the suitcase. Doesn't it bother you that he's so secretive about that? Why won't he tell us what's in it? Maybe it's a huge present for my birthday. Have you got a present for me yet? - Yep. Your biggest wish is going to come true! A puppy? All right, then, your second biggest wish. Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday, dear Babs Happy birthday to you Hip, hip, hooray Hip, hip, hooray Here you are, dear. - Is it a puppy?! Sweetheart, you know that's impossible because of daddy. The word puppy alone is enough to make him sneeze. Stop it. - Sorry, sweetheart. Look, your own wheelbarrow and garden set. You were so sweet to help me with the slugs the other day. So maybe you'd like to help me more often. - Oh, right. Right, now it's time for my present. We'll have to go get it first. Grandpa, where are we going? That's a surprise. Nice, isn't it? - Yes, very nice. For sure. Ah yes, you're here for the litter? Yes, siree. Well, this is a native pig, and this is a Berkshire, also well-known. So pick and choose. There you are, your present. A pig? What's wrong? Is your father allergic to pigs too? No, that's not it... It's just that this is the most wonderful present anyone has ever given me! Congratulations, Babs! Your biggest wish will come true now. Whoa. Where did you get that? - Present from Grandpa. Yes, give it to me. Come here, little piglet. Second-hand, but I restored it. - Thanks! It looks great! Wanna go for a test ride? No, we are going inside to introduce the piglet. Are you coming? There's the birthday girl! What have you got there? - This is... What is this? - Aww. Just a second, what's this? Come here, little piglet. - I'll get it. Almost. Got it. I've got you now. Oh no. What is he doing here? Oh, no. The cake. - Oh no. He's getting away. I've got him. Leave him alone. This is... Oink. And Oink is the best birthday present I've ever had in my life. Excuse me? No way! But Mum, just look how cute he is! And Daddy hasn't had a single sneeze yet. Now that you mention it... No, this is going to be a disaster, it already is! You say something, Nol. Well... Mum, please? Please? But you have no idea how to look after such an animal. I have plenty of experience with animals, I know exactly what to do. Yes, sure, experience with animals. I'd better not mention what kind of experience! Mum, Grandpa will teach me everything about how to look after Oink! We can give it a try, can't we? OK, but there will be rules! And if Oink breaks even one of them he'll have to go. Only four weeks and then the big contest starts. Who is going to be King Sausage of the Century? Who can make the best sausages in all Moppel? Is it your butcher... A chance? After everything he's done? Babs gets along with him very well. Who knows, he could be a nice grandpa. And is Babs at all aware of how 'nice' this grandpa is? She knows he left without warning. - And does she know why? Leave it, I know what I'm doing. - Hm, I don't trust him one bit! Careful with that piglet of yours. - What do you mean? What did I say? Oh, all right. I'm going! Nol! - Oh, yes... Rule number 1 . Oink is not to enter the house. Rule number 2. Oink is not to enter the vegetable garden. Rule number 3. Oink is not to poop anywhere but in the cat's litter tray. That's it. Understood? - Yes. Time to weigh! Why do you have to weigh him? - We want him to grow fast. Why is that? Because we want to turn Oink into a delicious little pig. Delicious? A delicious, homely and healthy little pig. Gee whizz, you do ask a lot of questions. Do you have another question, Babs? How do we make sure Oink becomes a healthy little pig? There are three magic words to achieve that. Play, eat and sleep. Play, eat, sleep Who hasn't grown up with that Play, eat, sleep Even if it doesn't come easy Playing makes you strong and big, little pig It makes you happy and glad Sometimes I get worried about you But then I quickly give you some food Yay. - Play, eat, sleep. Play, eat, sleep. - Come here, Oink. Play, eat, sleep. - Oink. It's going well. Sleeping is essential after a long day Look at how he grows Yes, play, eat, sleep is the magic word Even if it doesn't come easy This is how you should do it. Even if it doesn't come easy Oink? Oink? Oink! Grandpa! Afternoon. Hello, what can I do for you? I'll have a delicious pork sausage. Are they as nice as last time? Delicious pork sausages. I'm just making fresh sausages. Are you taking part in the contest? -Naturalmente. I am a serious candidate for the title of Sausage King of the Century. All I need now is to find the best pork there is. What's that?! Get out! Oink! He's caught Oink! What? - Give him to me. Is this another silly joke? You! - You? Come on, Babs. Let's go. Away from here. Wait. Stop, come here. Ouch! Stronzo! Beware, Babs. That butcher Smak is participating in the sausage contest. He wants to turn Oink into sausages. - Why Oink? Because Oink is a free-range pig and they have the best meat. What? That's not going to happen, not ever! - No. There. Oh, look. Grandpa? Perfect, don't you think? - I guess. Now you can no longer escape, can you, little Oink? It's meant to protect you against that creepy butcher Smak. Ready, guys? Action! I am standing here with butcher Smakkerelli, one of the contestants in the sausage contest. Smakkerelli is making his comeback after a disqualification 25 years ago. Smakkerelli, do you think you can win the King Sausage of the Century title? I've won the competition twice already. So I say: third time lucky. Impressive. I see only one trophy, though. But you say you won it twice. The other trophy unfortunately got... What! - Sorry. Oh dear, I do hope Smak manages to control his temper during the contest. Otherwise he can forget about the King Sausage title. Babs? What... Oh, man. Babs? Oink grew some wonderful buttocks. Hi! We're giving Oink a bath. Do you want to help us? Your grandpa can do that, can't he? Meanwhile we can go skateboarding. Oh no, Babs has to learn this if she wants to take care of her pig. Perfect temperature! Perfect for what, Tuit? We're going to give Oink a bath. - Yes, what do you mean? You know very well what I mean. Why have you come back here after all this time? You haven't changed one bit, Teenyweeny. - Don't you Teenyweeny me! If you insist: I'm here to enjoy the company of my granddaughter and Oink. Aunt, would you like to help give Oink a bath? Later on, dear... And you expect me to believe that? You can believe whatever you like. - In that case, let me tell you what I believe. I think you're gonna do exactly the same with Oink as with Mimy, Lotty, Pete... and that dear cat I got for my birthday. Right, I'm going to fetch Oink. Tijn, what have you done? Oink, where are you? There, in the veggie garden. - Oh no. Oink! Come here. Stay where you are. Oink, stay. Stay. Oink, come here, naughty pig. Come here. Look at that old Tuit running. Margreet isn't gonna like this. Oink, come here. I've got him, Grandpa. Why are you laughing? Just help. Oink, stop. Are you OK, Babs? Oh no. My garden! Oh, my God. My lettuce. I'm sorry, Babs. Oink can't stay! - But Mum... That is what we agreed. Nol, say something. Well yes, that is what we agreed, Babs. Greetje, you can't rob that child of her birthday present just like that. Don't you 'Greetje' me! How dare you step into my life like that? And then you ruin it with that pig. Greetje, Greetje... - Stop it. Where does Oink have to go to? I'm sure he can go back to the farm. Maybe it's better if I leave too. - No, Grandpa. I need you, and Oink too. You cannot leave. There we go. And walk, next to the boss. Next. So I mean next. Mum? - Yeah. I came up with an idea. - Well? Oink broke the rule about the vegetable garden... because he's still just a piglet. Like a puppy that's too young to behave. That's obvious. So I was thinking, if Oink could learn to behave... he wouldn't break any more rules, would he? - Right, he wouldn't. In that case I've found the solution. - What? Puppy course! In three weeks Oink will be Moppel's most obedient piglet. Sweetie... - I've already registered him. Mum, please, please. No, Babs, really... - Please, please, please... All right... I'll give Oink one more chance. But only if he passes the puppy course. Yes, promised. Beans will go over here. - Beans here. I want to put the carrots over here. Margreet... I did what was best for you. You were better off with Christine. - Yes, OK. Carrots. - Carrots, yeah. Carrots... Let's see how well the pups respond to their name. You can call your pup now. Twiggy. - Arie. Solange. - Oink. Oink. Oink, come here! Oink. Oink, what are you doing? Well, well, well... An obedient pup stays where he is when he's told to. So first tell him to stay and then walk away. Arie, stay. - Solange, stay. Twiggy, stay. - Oink, stay. Stay. Stay. Stay! Oink! Oh no... - Oh no, Oink. Here. Oink, don't. - Stay, stay, stay. This is not going to work. - Can we try just one more time? No, I'm sorry. Come back when he can behave. But that's what he's supposed to learn here. Hi. - Hi. Where is your grandpa? - He's helping my mother in the garden. I see. I thought Oink had to go back to the farm. - He does. Right. He got expelled from puppy course just now. Sorry. - That was his last chance! The moment I tell my mother what happened, he'll be sent straight back to the farm. In that case it might be better not to tell. - And then what? You know, train him yourself. Oink! Oink, come here. Well? Show me what Oink has learned today. Oink is a bit tired. Oh, come on, what has he learned? To sit? Well... Oink, sit! The first thing to learn was to come here, of course. Come here, Oink! Off you go, Oink. Go on, go. What did you do at that puppy course? It didn't go well at all. Oink can't come back until he knows how to behave. Don't tell your mother! When is the puppy exam? - I... I don't really know yet. So what does a piglet need to learn for a puppy exam? Oh, not very much I should think. One shouldn't expect too much. As long as he learns to behave. We're all going to be there to support Oink, aren't we, Greet? Sure. How are we going to teach this pig? Sit. Sit, Oink. Oink, sit. Damn pig. - Grandpa. Sorry, I didn't mean that. I just don't want you to be expelled again. Aww, dear Oinky. It's not your fault. Look what I got! Wait a second. Sit. I knew you weren't dumb. Oink, stay! Come here! Good job, Oink! Oink, come here. I've got it! I've got a plan how to train Oink! That's no longer necessary, as you can see we've found the solution. Can I see? - Good boy. I could do with your help in the veggie patch. - Oh, yes, of course. Focus on lying down and following! - Hey, this is with biscuits, too! Yes, I thought a reward would do the trick, as Oink is so fond of eating. Get bigger. Seven letters. Keep your distance. - Of course. Is this OK? Keep your dog close to you... Look Oink, you must follow. Good job, everyone. Great students. - Puppy exam. Sit. Very good, Oink. There. Oink, sit... and give paw. Good job. Give him a cookie. Bravo. Good job. Oh no. Look here, with best wishes from Christine. Such nonsense. Growing, that's it: growing! Prepared, prepared, can be checked. Very good, well done. Go Oink Go!!! Do your best, Oink. Let's start. - Hey. This puppy exam is an important moment in the life of your puppy. But also in yours. Pups enjoy working for their owners. Today, they will show that with the tricks they have enjoyed learning. Way to go, Oink. I can understand Babs being taken in by him. But you two? Christine! - I'm sorry, but I really can't bear it! To wind things up, the owners will give their pups the command to stay and come. I would keep a close eye on Oink if I were you! Tine, maybe you should forgive your brother. Maybe he's changed. People change, you know. - Yeah, people change. Fine, if that's what you choose to believe, suit yourself! Today we begin with the important command: sit. Sit. That won't do, Babs. Puppies listen because they are eager to please us. Not in exchange for biscuits. - But... Oink can take the exam, but he's not going to pass with biscuits! What's going on? What is that twit doing? - I guess the biscuits are not allowed. But that's ridiculous! Oink should take the exam without biscuits, like the other pups, right? And now, it's time for the last, but also the most important exercise: Sit and stay. Sit... and stay. Oink, sit. Oink, sit, now. Oink! Come, Oink, you can do it. Oink, if you don't sit down... you have to return to the farm... and I don't want that to happen, because I love you so much. Oh, sweetie. Having a pup is about bonding. And everything the pup does for you: sitting, lying down, staying... is a result of that bond. But this, ladies and gentlemen, is pure love. I'm giving Oink an A plus gold star for that! Passed with flying colours! You know what? Tonight we're throwing a party for Oink! An Oink party. Did you hear that, Oinky? A real party, especially for you! We will have to dress Oink up for the occasion. Yeah! Let's buy Oink a party outfit. Are you coming, Tijn? You go ahead. I'll see you tonight at the party. Look. It doesn't work. Tijn? It's alright if you see this. Do you make sausages? - That's my hobby. See, I told you so. - Don't worry. I don't make meat sausages. That's a lie! - No, it's not. Sausages can be made of all kinds of materials. Chocolate, biscuits... or even liquorice. - Liquorice? Sure. - Babs, you don't really believe this, do you? Why would Babs not believe it? Just turn the lever and there's the result. Don't be afraid. Grandpa doesn't make sausages from piglets. It takes a lot of practice before you can make a real nice juicy sausage. Voila, one liquorice sausage. Not bad. - Right. Here, try it. No, thanks! Well, well... You're such a neat little piglet with your tuxedo. Aww. What's keeping Aunt Christine? I'm afraid we won't see much of her for a while. Isn't Tijn coming? No. I don't know. Don't be sad, people. We're going to have a nice party. Come on. Today Oinky passed his exam Hey Tijn, if you're not angry anymore, come to the party. For pure love an A+ Without too much fuss He now behaves like a big Oink No more pooping inside and no more running away That's perfect, little Oink Come, sit and stay when the boss tells you to Yes, Oink can do it all What's the matter? Watch it. Nol, do something. Oh, crap. Filthy animal! Never mind, Oink, it's OK. - No, it's not. I guess it's clear, he's going to the farm and that is the last we'll see of him. Then he'll be sold to butcher Smakkerelli. And he'll turn Oink into sausages for that stupid sausage contest! I can understand how you feel, but he's going. No, you don't understand it at all. If you understood me you'd know that Oink makes me very happy. Grandpa understands that. - Grandpa... All you can think about is yourself! So you still have that pig? He has grown fat indeed. Your grandpa is fattening him. I know what you want to do to Oink. Me? You mean your grandpa. You'd better hold on tight to that little piggy of yours... or Tuitjes will turn him into sausages. What lies are you telling her? Leave Babs alone! I warned you. What now? Oink can't live without us. I'm taking Oink with me to America. That way he's with one of us. But how will I live without you two? Search for Tuitjes Head of the jury of the King Sausage Contest is Willem Braad. Willem, what does it take for a sausage to become the winner? The richness of the taste is important and also the balance of the herbs and spices. Also important is how juicy the sausage is. And last but not least the texture... My sweet Oink. Never before, ladies and gentlemen, not once in all those 75 years... has anything like this happened. This is appalling. Will we be seeing more of butcher Smak and butcher Tuitjes in 25 years? Butcher Tuitjes? Ladies and gentlemen, today is the day. The hundredth edition of the King Sausage Contest. We've been waiting for this for weeks. Who will be... No... Oink? Grandpa. Oh Babs... - What is it? Where is Oink? Grandpa Tuitjes has run off with Oink and his sausage grinder. But Grandpa doesn't make sausages from pigs! I'm so sorry, I wanted to believe that he'd changed... I should have told you a long time ago. Grandpa used to be a butcher... and he always took part in the King Sausage Contest... Tijn was right! Babs, wait! King Sausage. Entrance. ...have done their utmost to... Have you by any chance seen a piglet around? This place is crawling with pigs... - No! These are sausages! How shall I put it... Are you alright girl? - I'm looking for my pig Oink. He's at the farm. I let your grandpa a shed, for him and his pig to stay for a few days. But he doesn't want to be disturbed by anyone. Participants King Sausage of the Century Babs, where are you? Oink, here you are. Gee whizz... These are going to be the most delicious sausages ever! Come, Oink. Quickly. Babs, why don't you come in? Tijn, are you all right? - I guess so. Let me have a look. No, I'm fine. I have to get to Babs now. Oink is in danger! - Tuit undoubtedly. He is participating in the sausage contest. - I knew it! I'm going to look for him! Oink is in danger, Tuit wants to turn him into sausages! Where is Babs? No idea. I wanted to go after her, but... I should have listened to you from the start! - Oh, never mind, get in, we're in a hurry! Thick sausage, big sausage... juicy sausage... spicy sausage, farmer sausage... You're not turning Oink into sausages! Well, Babs. Isn't this what we've been working towards these weeks? And Oink more than anyone else. He will be so proud if his sausages win. How can Oink be proud if he's dead? Now let me see, parsley, thyme, pepper... But you love Oink too, don't you? Of course I do! I love Oink more than anyone else! I love his delicious champion meat. Just wait until you taste a sausage... then you'll know exactly what I mean and you'll never want anything else. You were the world's best grandpa. Come on, you're a big girl, aren't you? You know what? When I've finished the sausages we'll get you a new piglet. I don't want a new pig, I want Oink to stay alive. But what about the sausage contest? You do want your dear grandpa to be King Sausage, don't you? One more onion... Tijn was right. You're vicious and mean! Oink is not going into that meat grinder. Never. You're not stopping me now. I'm going to be King Sausage of the Century! No, Grandpa, I'm begging you! Did you see a girl with dark hair and glasses on a bicycle? Or an old man and a pig? They were heading towards that farm. Twiggy, Solange... Come along, Solange. Arie. Hey, come along! Huh? Babs! I'm coming. Tijn. - Give Oink back. Let go. Don't give up, Tijn. And is there anything you can tell us about this special recipe? Don't make me laugh. It's secret! Testing, testing... Welcome to Crimewatch. We are looking for a sweet little girl with glasses, a pink pig... and a dangerous, ugly old man wearing a cowboy hat. That's that. And now, pay attention children. The party is getting started. No! Don't do it! - Grandpa. Someone help. Filthy animal! What are you doing? Well done, Oink! Hey, we're looking.... - In the shed at my yard. We're going to turn you into sausages, Tuit. So, now Oink has finished pooping, We can finally start the real job. Tuit! Open the door, you mean creep! - Babs, where are you? Not just now, Teenyweeny, I'm busy. - Nol, do something! Nollie! Stop! What are you doing? - That old sneak is turning Oink into sausages. Not in my yard, he isn't! 1,2,3... Oh, poor children! Oh, no! Oink! Poor Oink! I'm so sorry, we'll give him a worthy funeral. That's not Oink. Grandpa has escaped through the window with Oink! What? But what is this? Come on, Greet. There he is, after him... This way. There he is. - Come on. He's getting away with the tractor. Hey, I'll follow him on this moped. Babs, Tijn, get on. - Be careful. You can't drive that thing. If you can drive a Canta, you can drive anything! What a woman! Ho ho, to the left. There he is. Yes, and follow. Just you wait, Tuit! - Think so? Yeah! Guys, wait for me. Wait for me. My moped is not that fast. I'm going this way. - Good idea, then I'll go that way. See you soon. - Yep. Calm down Twiggy, do you want a biscuit? Here is a biscuit. Guys, wait a sec. Oh, dear. I'll get you, Tuit. - Is that right? No... Faster. Get him. There you go, Oink. No! - Oh yes. Hey, buzz off, you stupid dogs. Hey, get lost. Go away. Leave those dogs alone, animal abuser! Now it's your turn. No! Hurry! Catch him, Babs. - No! Let go! This is bad for his meat! Let him go, Grandpa. Babs! Keep it up, Tijn! Fire! No! Yes, very good. This one's for you, and this one... Greetje. - Don't you Greetje me! I'm not your Greetje. Oink sausages! I'm going to be King Sausage. I'm going to be King Sausage! I'm going to be King Sausage. But what was in those sausages? Ai, ai, ai, the tension is mounting over here. The jurors are about to start tasting. Butcher Smakkerelli's sausages are the first to be tested. Delicious. Thank you. - Is delicious, huh? Here are the best sausages. The next contestant is Butcher Tuitjes. You can feel the rivalry between them. They were both disqualified 25 years ago during that memorable competition. These ones look great. Wait, let me turn them round once more. Will things run smoothly this time? They have a special colour. Interesting smell. A farm smell. - Yes, they're super fresh. Fresher than yours. I'm so curious, I can't wait. But... what is in these sausages? Oh no... - Let's taste them. No, don't eat those sausages! How dare you! Unbelievable. Disgusting! - Come here! I knew it! This is even worse than rats' tails. These sausages are filled with... POOP! We've seen the last of him. Ladies and gentlemen, the 1 00th edition of the King Sausage Contest... has been won by butcher Smakkerelli. Congratulations on this well-deserved title: King Sausage of the Century. I am so happy! And so the King Sausage Contest ended up in dirty chaos. Anyone who was present, won't want sausages for a long time. Butcher Tuitjes was banned for life and has never been seen again. But now, after one year, the real sausage lovers are excited again. Because this is a new century of sausage contests. Hop, get the stick. Where is the stick? Got it. Have we got everything? - Yep. We'll show those butchers something. Hurry up, or we'll be too late. - We're coming. Hurry up, hurry up! Can butcher Smakkerelli defend his title? We'll find out today. Welcome to the 1 01 st edition of the King Sausage Contest. Look who's here! - Here I am, King Sausage. Even Oink and his family are joining the contest. If I may ask, what kind of sausages are these? As brown as last year's? Get it? These sausages are made of fresh vegetables from our garden. Want to try? - Well, OK. Cheers, darling. - You too. To your health. Sit, lie down and roll. Very good. Sensational. - Exactly. These vegetarian sausages will be a real challenge for Butcher Smak. Maybe she'll be Queen Sausage this year.
