What's with this guy?! Come back, ladies! You don't know?! That's Moroboshi Ataru of Tomobiki High! Ladies! What?! THE Moroboshi Ataru?! C'mon, c'mon, let's go on a date! C'mon, c'mon! Go! What the hell are those?! Old man! Gimme another! Sheesh! Would you just go away?! Sheesh! Would you just go away?! Aw, c'mon! Don't say that! Man, he just doesn't know when to quit... Just leave us alone! Damn. Another pair that got away... Yo, babe! Let's go on a date! A... A shy one, eh? A... A shy one, eh? Darling! Darling! L... Lum! Darling! Why do you always do this, Darling?! When you have me for a fianc√© already! You just went and decided that all on your own! Back to my girl-hunt... Th... That's him! After him! Come back! 'Scuse me! Darling! Where are you?! Do you think I'll just keep falling for this over and over again? Huh?! Darling... Darling! Where are you?! That was close... Well, back to my girl-hunt! Hold it right there! Hold it right there! Hold it right there! Huh? We have identified you as Mr. Moroboshi Ataru! We need you to come with us for a while. C'mon! Come this way! H... Hey now! G... Get out of my way! What the hell was that all about?! Get up! Does he think this will make us give up? Does he think this will make us give up? Maybe I'll go after Miss Sakura this time... What sort of grudge do you guys have against me, anyway? Uh, we have no grudge; we have business with you! Get him! Get him! Right! We did it! We did it! We got him real good! Now look here... Leave me alone! Now, you guys... who are you? P... Please don't do anything violent... Oh no! A... A UFO! Sure looks tasty... Hey, you guys! What's taking you so long?! Um, well, Princess... The man known as Moroboshi Ataru has shown... ...himself to possess strength beyond imagining... ...and so capturing him and bringing him aboard the spaceship... ...will be most difficult... Hi! Babe! Princess! Babe, it is surely some sort of destiny that has brought us together. Wh... What are you doing?! Why you! Get your hands off me! Babe! You fool! Excellent, Princess! Babe! You scum! Babe! The reports appear to be true... The reports appear to be true... Unbelievable... That guy possesses awe-inspiring lust, he does... Darling! Darling, where are you? This... is Darling's fan! DARLING! Th... This sign! I hope there won't be trouble in this town again... Benten! Oyuki! Benten! Oyuki! What is it, Lum?! What's with that look on your face? What could be the matter? Darling's been kidnapped! Oh my... Oh my... Say what?! Moroboshi's been kidnapped? There sure are strange people wandering the night... I see. The kidnapper must be... I see. The kidnapper must be... ...some kind man from the Department of Waste Management! Darling is not some piece of garbage! Well then, some kind person from Animal Control... Darling is not a dog, either! What took him was some UFO that I've never seen before! A UFO?! Babe! I am not your babe. I am the Royal Princess of the Universe... Princess Lupica! Princess Lupica! Lupica! You've got a pretty name... The truth is, I had a reason for having you abducted and brought here. A reason? Tell me... In the northeast quadrant of the universe... ...there is a small planetoid known as... ...Planet "Holy Temple..." ...Planet "Holy Temple?" What a passionate woman you are, Princess Lupica! That you would propose to me so suddenly... Huh? To say that you wish to consummate marriage with me at that temple... Who said anything about marriage?! B... But what should I do? To be approached by a girl like this is luck beyond belief... ...but if I married her, I wouldn't be able to girl-hunt anymore! But then, I can't just let this babe escape before my very eyes, either... What the heck could be going through this guy's brain? It's probably a waste of time even trying to figure it out... Well, the one thing that IS certain is that we can't talk to him normally! There's no choice... We'll have to make a deal. We're going to a temple, but that does not mean an immediate wedding. What? First, there must be a period of dating... ...in order to cultivate mutual understanding. Then let's cultivate! However, despite what I may want... ...I am still the Royal Princess of the Universe! Eh? In order to date me, you must first obtain, from the far northeast quadrant... ...the Crystal Jar at the heart of Planet Holy Temple, as an offering to me. So dictates strict law. Is there a law like that? Is there a law like that? Hey! Shut up! The Crystal Jar? Uh-huh. If you manage to acquire that jar, then we two... Understood. I shall obtain that jar for you, no matter what it takes! But anyhow, in the meantime, what say you... ...gimme a little something in advance, so I can... This is the ship that Darling was taken by! Th... This... Th... This... Oh! You recognize it? Damn, but you draw badly! Come to think of it, Lum, even in planetary elementary school... ...drawing was never your strong suit... I'm serious! Ah, forgive me. But I don't think either one of us has ever seen a ship like that before, have we? Right. But Lum, what with you havin' no real leads and all... ...what's the point of having us chase blindly out into space after him? Forget it, then! Anyway, I'll send this to the Interstellar Patrol and have them look it up! Hey, Lum! Hey, Lum! Dad! Mom! You know, we were just wondering, but how is our dear son-in-law? What? We don't know for what reason... ...but someone has been digging around the computer network... ...for data on our dear son-in-law. Digging around? Digging around? And also... And also... And also? And also... Actually, uh... Actually, uh... Actually? You tell her! You tell her! ! ! This is the mother's job! ! This is the mother's job! This is the mother's job! ! Will ONE of you tell me?! Uh, well... ...it seems that the search topic used was... ..." The most lecherous being in the universe." The most lecherous being... The most lecherous being... ...in the universe? T I knew he was bad, but... ...the worst in the universe?! What's so funny?! Now there's no doubt! Surely the same person who checked up on Darling also stole him away! This whole thing must have been planned from the beginning! Poor Darling! Hunted down and kidnapped by this evil alien... ...he can't be anything but miserable! Princess! Hey, Hey, hey, Hey, hey, hey, Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Come on, now! Get the hell away from me! Get the hell away from me! Princess! He must be frozen with fear, faced with such terrible wickedness... Now I have you! This guy is beyond belief... It's possible... ...that he may even have been forcibly taken to some faraway star system! Darling... ...how pitiful... But who would need to find the most lecherous being in the universe... ...and why? ...and why? I wouldn't know... Well, we finally put him to sleep, huh? Anesthesia and paralysis drugs... Anesthesia and paralysis drugs... ...sleeping pills and lullabies... We had a tough time with this! Done! Princess! The new suitors' photographs have arrived! These ones really look like they're worth taking home! I don't want to see them! But Princess! Next year, you will turn eighteen. You must soon find yourself a wonderful prince... ...and take the Queen's Throne... ...and take the Queen's Throne... Oh, will you shut up?! But by law dating back 2000 years in the Royal Family... ...you must marry by your eighteenth birthday... ...in order to be allowed to succeed to the throne. There can be no exception to... There can be no exception to... That's enough! Hey! How about some of the best tofu in the universe! Banner: "No. 1 in Space" Hey! How about some of the best tofu in the universe! Banner: "No. 1 in Space" Banner: "No. 1 in Space" Healthy and nutritious! Good for your appearance! Banner: "No. 1 in Space" Banner: "No. 1 in Space" Tastes great, too! How about some delicious tofu for you! M... Mr. Tofu-man! Hi! How are you? So, what'll it be today? Tw... Tw... Twelve cotton-filtered! Right! Here you go! That'll be 1440 credits. Exact change. Thank you! Th... Th... Then, I'll see you tomorrow... Right. See you tomorrow. What the hell?! Hey, have you heard anything from Lum recently? How should I know! Hey, hey, Ten! Have you heard anything from Lum recently? Well, Lum still can't figure out where that stupid Ataru's been taken... ...so she's goin' all around, tryin' to find out! Really? You DO know! You DO know! Wanna go for it? Stupid Interstellar Patrol! What is it with their stupid priorities?! They should be putting more effort into their searching! But y'know, speakin' frankly, Lum... ...there ain't a whole lot more we can do... We don't have any real proof that he was actually kidnapped, after all... I won't give up! I won't... I won't ever give up! Say... ...do any of you know the latest word on Princess Lupica's impending marriage? M... Marriage?! Oh, you didn't hear? And you a childhood friend of hers, too... Suitors from all over the universe... ...are sending her offers of marriage, it's being said... Lupica's getting married! Why don't you propose to her, too? Wh... Wh... What? Wh... Wh... What? I'm kidding, of course! I'm kidding, of course! Y... Yes, of course... I'm kidding, of course! Of course you're joking! Even if we ARE childhood friends, a tofu peddler and a princess... ...is just a little bit unrealistic. Just a little! Yo, you should slow down a bit. Strictly speaking, you're a minor, after all! Hey you! Minor, shminor! There're babies drinkin' o'er there! Those're beings from Tamashi, in the Umezu System. They may look like babies, but they're already 30. Young woman, is it love that troubles you so? Excuse me fer livin'! Uh, well, I was just wondering if you'd want your fortune told, or... Fortune? That's right. So if you would care to buy me a drink? Man! Always a catch! Man! Always a catch! OK, then! Lum, this is on your bill, all right? Just one drink is nothing to worry about! Waiter! I'll have the usual! Just one drink, indeed... That was good! Nice 'n' strong... This old wreck can certainly chug. I don't understand oldsters anymore... Lum, this is on your bill, all right? All right, already! What's this?! The one you love is currently traveling with another woman. What are you saying?! What are you saying?! Hey, calm down! Darling... Darling would do something like that! Wait! Lum! Wait! Lum! Lum! Some people really should know their limits... But, man, so he's travelling with some other babe... Well, if she's taken an interest in the most lecherous guy in the universe... ...she can't be no respectable babe herself. What? What did you just say? What? You just said "the most lecherous guy in the universe..." Yeah. So what of it? Have you ever heard of Planet Holy Temple? Nope. It's nestled in the northeast corner of the universe... Deep within that temple there is said to be hidden a jar... ...which is rumored to contain the Ultimate Love Potion... The Ultimate... Love Potion? Yeah, and it's also said that only the most lecherous being in... ...the universe can get inside the temple and retrieve the jar safely... Hey! W... W... W... Wait! Wait! The fortune also says that even going near Planet Holy Temple... ...will bring you all great calamity... Old woman! Old woman! Your bill! Your bill! Your bill! Your bill! Uh... my bill? It comes to 28,450 credits. What in the world can THAT be? Lt... lt's a drink 'n run! Pay your bill! What a perfect opportunity! Under cover of this darkness, I'll finally get my chance to kiss Lupica! Look at those hips! I can't hold back any longer! Lupica! Dammit! Hands off! Princess! A bottomless chasm! We can't go any further! It's a trap! An illusory voice trying to lure us over the edge! But nobody's stupid enough to fall for something as obvious as that, right? I'm waiting for you... Right, right! Babe! I'm coming now! Everyone! After him, quickly! This way... This way! Right! I'm coming! Right! I'm coming! Over this way! The reports are true... Unbelievable... What awe-inspiring... ...power of lust! This way... Th... That's! ...the Universe's Patron God of Lust! I... lf I can get past this door and get that jar... ...l'll be able to do this with that beautiful Lupica... and that as well! His lechery is becoming a rising aura! What lecherous thoughts must he be thinking? I don't even want to think about it! Bingo! That must be... the Crystal Jar... Thanks for your help! With this, all obstacles to our love have been eliminated! W... Wait! H... Help me! Lupica! Perfect. Now that I have the Crystal Jar in my hands, you no are longer of any use. WHAT?! I might as well tell you now. Inside this Crystal Jar is the Ultimate Love Potion! The Ultimate Love Potion? A love potion? A love potion? I had no idea at all... Whoever drinks any of this... ...will instantly fall in love with the first person they lay eyes on! You were lying to me all along! You damn bitch! Be silent! Princess! Wait! Hey! You can't just leave me here! You at least owe me a kiss! You cold-hearted BITCH! How dare you act like a nice girl... ...and toy around with the lust of an innocent high school student! I won't die without a kiss! We have done Mr. Moroboshi a sad injustice... May Buddha have mercy on his soul... So, anyway, Princess. What are you planning to do with that potion? Yeah! You already have your choice of any number of suitors, after all... W... Well, uh... But still, this really is a creepy place, isn't it? Seems almost like a cemetery... Hey! A sarcophagus! Let's leave this creepy place at once! LUPICA! Huh? Oh! It dumped me in a coffin! Ah! Lupica! What the hell are you doing?! What's it look like?! I'm seeing that you keep your end of the bargain! P... Princess! L... look! Give it back! No way. I'm not giving it back. Not even if I die... Give it back! No way! Last chance. Give up and give it back! Never! Never! Never! Never! Not until you keep your promise! At least let me kiss you! Even now, that's all you can think of! I shall now erase you and your lust from the universe! L... Lum?! Darling! You all right? Darling! Lum! Back to the ship, quickly! Thanks! D... Damn you! All right, all right, take this! And this, and this! I ain't been this charged up in a long time! Farewell, Planet Holy Temple... Farewell, Lupica. My one regret is that I was unable to kiss you... Although... I DO have this now! Who should I give it to first, I wonder...? This oughtta be fun! Maybe Miss Sakura...? ...or Ran... ...or Shinobu...? ...or Ryuu... ...Ryoko! ...or Benten... ...Oyuki... ...Princess Kurama! All the babes will be mine! Ah! So that's the notorious Love Potion! Wh... What're you talking about? Darling! It's no use playing innocent! I know you're up to no good! Bullseye! Hand that over to me! H... Hey! Stop that! It's started again... Shit, such a worthless husband... ...if we'd left him buried alive on that planet... ...it would've been better for all concerned... We have, however, rescued him... So let us return him now to Tomobiki. We'll be entering warp soon... Hey! Give it to me! Have one of my lightning balls! Th... This is! Th... This is! A bad omen! Step aside, step aside, let me through! This is terrible... Very soon now, a great calamity shall befall us all... What? Darling, come back here! Miss Lum! Miss Lum! Welcome back, Lum! Hey, you two! No sooner do you come back to class...! A footwarmer in midsummer has an elegance all its own... I won't let you catch me! Oh my... something just went by... Man... what a mess we've made... It was Lum's fault that the warp malfunctioned! I'll have to see that she pays for the ship repairs... Damn! But still, all this fuss over some stupid love potion... L... Love potion?! Yeah... the Ultimate Love Potion or somethin'... Whoever drinks any of it instantly falls in love... ...with the first person they see, or so it's said... The Ultimate... The Ultimate... ...Love Potion?! ...Love Potion?! If I get hold of that! ...Love Potion?! If I get hold of that! If I get hold of that! If I give some to Lum! If I give some to Mendou! If I give some to Rei! Come back here, you bastard! Hey! Class isn't over yet! All right! That does it! All this happened because Moroboshi brought a love potion to class! Confiscation! This looks like fun! Let's go watch! What the? If one were to get involved in all that confusion... ...it might be only one chance in 10,000, but... ...if Lum's husband were to get you with that love potion... ...it'd be your undoing! No kidding... Come back, Darling! Like hell I'll give it to you! Like hell I'll give it to you! Darling! It's no use hiding in a place like this! Hey! Open up! Trapped her but good! Bye! That was too easy... My beautiful future rides on this love potion! Did you think I'd let it get away from me that easily? Now, who should I give it to first, who first? Yer a real disgusting bastard, you womanizer, you! Now fork over that love potion! Moroboshi! Uh-oh! Those guys don't quit! If they keep this up, I'm dead! I'll take... two slices... Oh! Mom! Oh! Mom! Oh, you're back! What a fortunate meeting... What a fortunate meeting... What? What? Moroboshi! What? Well, I'm kinda busy right now, so... Could you please make that four slices instead? It's... gone! I've gone and hidden it! I've gone and hidden it! Where did you hide it?! Where did you hide it?! Talk, Moroboshi! Where did you hide it?! Where have you hidden it?! Um... let's see... at the bottom of the Tomobiki River... Huh? Oh, no. I don't remember buying anything like this... "Please keep this safe for me until I get home!" It's Ataru's! Sheesh! Darling's giving me a hard time again! I hope it's not yet another strange thing... ...or maybe I buried it on the school grounds... WHAT?! ...or maybe... ...or maybe... WHAT?! ...or maybe... WHAT?! Next you'll be saying Tokyo Bay... ...or the summit of Mt. Fuji! Wrong! Guess again! Damn you! Wait! Wait! Stop! Stop! Watch it! Watch it! Watch it! Stop! Help! Those guys never learn... In any case, Benten and Oyuki have shown some wisdom... One wonders upon whom Moroboshi Ataru intends to use that love potion... Moroboshi Ataru! Lupica! You came back to keep your promise! Don't be an idiot! Talk! Where is the love potion?! We don't need a love potion, now, do we? Talk! A... At the bottom of the Tomobiki River... Things have gotten to the point where I may just... ...have to give Lupica some of the love potion! I'm home! Mom, where's that jar I left with you? It's over on the tea table! It's over on the tea table! Thank you! Found it! That sure was a good idea I came up with back there... I'll never let anyone take this away! Ataru! Want some juice? Ataru! Want some juice? Thanks, Mom! Gotcha but good! L... Lum?! So how did the love potion taste, Darling? The... The love potion? Wh... What are you talking about? The love potion is, uh, right here, unopened, see? That's a fake! That's a fake! A... A fake? I have the real one... ...and I added a bit to the juice you just drank! N... No way! Now, Darling... look at me! Hey! Why're you turning away?! All you have to do is look at me once... ...and you will love me from the bottom of your heart! You'll stop all your infidelity... We'll have our happy ending! It's done! If I open my eyes now, I'll be under Lum's thumb forever! I won't be able to girl-hunt anymore! Like hell I'm gonna open my eyes! Darling! Stop being so stubborn! Moroboshi Ataru! You will pay for trying to trick the Royal Princess of the Universe! Lupica! I love you! Lupica! I love you! Why you! This is all your fault! What?! If you... If you hadn't come butting in like that... ...Darling would be crazy for me right now! What? You don't mean... you used the love potion?! That's right! Fool! Lupica! Looks like this stuff really works! So long! I've no more time for the likes of you! Lupica! Stop it, Darling! Lupica! Darling, snap out of it! Darling! Lupica, Lupica... Shock therapy time! Lupica... Lupica, Lupica, Lupica... Lupica! No effect... Ah! Hold it! Stop! Let go of me, damn you! You must know! Know what? The way to bring Darling back to normal! Well... ...I don't know! If I did, I would've done it already. Come on, now! All of this has happened because you set... ...Darling to finding that love potion in the first place! Oh! And let's just ignore the fact that it was you who gave it to him! So what are you planning to use that love potion for anyway? Who're you planning to use it on? Lupica! Lupica! Darling, let go of her! Princess! Lupica! Lupica! Lupica! Lupica! Lupica! Da... Darling! Lupica! Miss Lum... Do you know where the love potion is? I don't want to talk about it... What? About the love potion, I don't want to talk about it... What's wrong, Lum? What's happened to you? And where has that scoundrel Moroboshi disappeared to? Lupica! Wh... Wh... What the hell?! The love potion did this. Darling no longer has eyes for anybody except that bazooka girl now... No way! Not Ataru! Right! Just one girl for Moroboshi? It can't be true... It can't be true... This bodes ill... This bodes ill... Inconceivable! This bodes ill... Pardon me, ma'am... What? H... Hey, wh... what are you? Lupica! No way! Hey! Stop! What're you! Pardon us, Miss Sakura... What the hell're you doing?! Lupica! The thing that threatens us is the power of that love potion! Quit making such weird entrances! But... to imagine that it could've had an effect as strong as that... Say, Lum! Where's that love potion now? Someday... Someday Darling might have come to love me and only me... But because... because... ...because I gave him the love potion... ...all this... all this... I hate this! I hate this! Lum... Rio! Hi! How are you? So, what'll it be today? S... Seventeen cotton-filtered! S... Seventeen cotton-filtered! Right! Here you go! S... S... Say... S... S... Say... Yes? A... Are you thirsty at all? Uh... not really... Oh, really! So you are thirsty! What? What? In, uh, in that case, here... Have this! OK... So that's him. So that's him. Yes. Well then, thanks... Um... Um... Wha? Is it really true? About, uh, y... About what? About what? About your seeking suitors. About your seeking suitors. What?! About your seeking suitors. Uh... well, it was just a rumor I heard, and... It's true... Is that so... Wow, but time flies... I mean, the first time we met, we were both only children... After that, you came every single day to deliver tofu. Yeah... Neither rain... ...nor wind... ...nor even spears... could stay you from your appointed rounds. I got well as quickly as I could, so I could buy my own tofu from you. We were... so happy, back then... Tofu really is good for your health, you know! Yeah... and I'm really happy your future husband will be eating my tofu, too! Rio! Rio! Huh? Huh? Drink that, now! Huh? Drink that, now! Drink that, now! Um... right. Um... What is it? What is it? Thank you for the drink! "Th... Thank you?" N... Nothing more? "Nothing more?" Um, well, it's really good water, but... Wa... Water? Uh no, not "Wa-waterTM," it's just water... No way! This can't be happening! Princess Lupica... ...our social standings are just too far apart. H... How can this have happened? Lupica! He hasn't changed since yesterday, it seems... In spite of how unfaithful he used to be... Though it is much more peaceful now... Somehow, even I don't feel right about this, you know. So where's Lum? Since last night, she hasn't been seen, even at the Moroboshi household... I see... But it's too bad the potion got smashed, it woulda been nice to have... What? Wh... What! You smashed it to pieces?! That's not good at all... Giving him another dose of the love potion... ...would have counteracted it easily... ...would have counteracted it easily... What? What? What?! What? Is there nowhere else we could get more of the same love potion? Well... it was originally the collected nectar... ...of the flower of the Moondrop Plant... But the Moondrop has long since been extinct, so... Wh... What have... What have I done?! However, there is still one thing that can be done... Yo! Another round! So, what is this one thing? From the soil the love potion soaked into... ...upon the night of the next full moon, a single Moondrop flower ought to sprout. Pick that flower, and feed him its nectar... ...and Darling will return to normal, right? However, if exposed to the light of dawn... ...the flower will fade, wither, and die! If that happens, you're out of luck! Earth's next full moon is... Earth's next full moon is... ...tonight! Hey! W... W... Wait! Y... You promised to pay last time's bill, and buy today's drinks, too. N... No way... Old woman! Old woman! Your bill! Your bill! Together with the last one, it comes to 52,090 credits. What in the world can THAT be?! Hey now, did you really expect the same trick to work twice? Actually, I did... Actually, I did... Now pay up! I'll take care of that bill! Whatsa matter? You're drinking more than usual! Nothing's the matter... Oh yeah, it seems Princess Lupica's gone to Earth again today... She seems to be going there a lot, a lot... I wonder if she's finally fallen for a suitor? Hmm? Hmm? Lupica! What an unlucky guy... Lupica! The Moondrop flower... Lupica! Lupica! Lupica! Lupi... I'll take that Moondrop flower! I won't let you have it! I'm going to give this flower to Darling! You! Lupica! You! Lupica! I love you... I love you... I love you... I love you... Don't underestimate Moroboshi! I love you... I love you... I love you... I love you... If Lum lets you have that flower... I love you... I love you... I love you... I love you... ...Moroboshi will pursue you for the rest of his life! I love you... I love you... There is no man in the world who is more single-mindedly lecherous than he! He has no morals! He has no morals! He has no common sense! He has no common sense! He has no principles! He has no common sense! He will pursue you unto death! Natto: Fermented soybeans He'll stick to you like natto! Natto: Fermented soybeans Natto: Fermented soybeans Not just natto, but rotten natto! Rotten, moldy, and with flies swarming all around, too! You don't have to say things THAT bad! Um, well, we're doing all this for your sake... Enough! Enough talk! I'm taking that flower! You coward! You coward! Wh... What?! Y'know... ...instead of talking about love potions... ...you really oughta tell that stringy- natto-dude how you feel! Oh my, wouldn't "Tofu patty-lad" be more descriptive? Wr... Wr... Wrong! He's a TOFU-MAN! So if ya just told that tofu-man that ya loved him... ...wouldn't that solve all yer problems? Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! So long! Come back! Lupica! Lupica! I won't let you get away! The Princess is in danger! To her defense! Right! Mendou Air Corps! To Miss Lum's defense! Sheesh! This is all so pointless! That's it! The tofu-man! Fire! I hope Lum's OK... Ice cream! How 'bout some ice cream! Hey now! Help me out here, undutiful offspring! To make enough money to renovate Hama Teashop... ...work hard, work hard, we have to work hard now! This is no time for that! This is no time for that! How 'bout some ice cream! Tonight's "Stupid TV Til Dawn" is changing its regular schedule... ...to report to you live from THAT Tomobiki Town instead! Take a look! A raging battle is occurring even as I speak, in the skies above! The root of all this insanity once again seems to be related to... ...that familiar troublemaker, 17- year-old Moroboshi Ataru! Lupica! Oh no. What a huge mess he's caused. The neighbors are going to give us the eye again. I've got it bad at the office, too... OK! We're going into warp now! A... Ain't that? A... Ain't that? Mr. Tofu-man! Hi! Cotton-filtered, or silky? Lupica! Princess Lupica... Lupica's up there... fighting like mad, all just for you! What? What? Tell Lupica you love her! Wh... What're you talking about?! Lupica's in love with you, fool! Wha? This all happened 'cuz she wanted to use a love potion on you! If you just tell Lupica you love her, everything'll turn out fine! Y... You're joking! Th... Th... There's no way Princess Lupica would be... i... in love with me! You're also in love with her, right? N... No way! That's absurd! But... did you not come all the way to Earth out of worry for the Princess? No, um... I came... s... simply to sell my tofu! Enough crap! You'll tell her you like her... OK? You'll tell her you love her, OK?! You will, will you not? Tell her! I... I can't! Damn you! Give it back! Never! I won't give up! Everything's... Everything's my fault! It's all because I gave Darling the love potion! It's all because of me! If Darling hates me, I'll have to live with it! But... I have to... ...I have to bring Darling back to normal! I have to! Freeze, Lupica! Rio! Rio! Princess Lupica! Now... hand over the Moondrop flower! If he's dead, you won't have much use for that flower, right? Now let's trade! And then you both can return home safely... You dirty cowards! So, hand it over! Lupica! Darling?! That fool! Lupica! I love you! I love you! I love you! P... Princess Lupica! Darling! I love you! Ah! I... lt's that lecher guy! Ah! I... lt's that lecher guy! What single-mindedness! What single-mindedness! Princess! Help is coming! What single-mindedness! Got him! C'mon! Everybody pull! If we combine our strength, we can do anything! Right! Heave! Heave! Lupica! How mortifying... You ill-mannered fool! What are you doing to Princess Lupica?! Stop it! Stop it! Now, Darling... come over here! Hurry up and come here! Hurry up and come here! Lupic... Looks like a draw! So I shall keep this Moroboshi Ataru in my custody, away from you all! What? What? What?! Until that flower fades, withers, and dies, that is! Come back! YES! Lupica! Lupica! Darling! Princess Lupica! L... Lupica! Princess Lupica... Princess Lupica... Rio! Darling! Darling! Lupica, Lupica, Lupica! Darling! Lupica! Bastard! Darling! Good! Good! Retreat! No! I don't want to die like this! Men be damned! Now's my chance to show the results of daily, bloody training! Over to you, Ryuunosuke! Over to you, Ryuunosuke! Right! Here I go! Attack! Moroboshi! Why... Why you! Heave! This is youth! Darling, here, take this... The nectar won't... come out! Lum! Darling... Lum... Lum... Darling! Lupica! Lupica! Darling! He's not back to normal?! Damn you! Miss Sakura! Moroboshi! So you... ...ARE back to normal! Shinobu! Ryuu! Ran! He... He's back! ...back to normal! He's back to the same old Darling! Darling! Darling! Bastard! Darling! Knock it off already! Rio... Rio! Rio! Rio! Rio! Princess Lupica... ...l'm glad... you're all right... Same to you, thank God you're all right! Princess Lupica... ...l... l'm... afraid all I know is how to make tofu, but... m... may I... ...ask for your hand in marriage? Rio! Ah! I get it! The Princess wanted the love potion to give to Rio! Ah! I see! Ah! I see! Chief! You're sharp! Heh! You're meant for each other! If you'd just told each other sooner, we coulda avoided this whole big mess! Shut up! We're leaving! We're leaving right now! Yes. Let's go home. Farewell! It's been a treat! It's been a treat! Best wishes! Bye, and sorry for all the trouble! Sorry for all the trouble! In spite of the calamity which has happened... ...this really is an occasion for celebrating... Those two will surely find happiness together... I understand now! Even without a love potion, one can still find true love! Yeah! That's right... using love potions is immoral! To think I actually wanted something like that... ...l'd like to find a hole to crawl into! It was the right thing for Lum to destroy it! This means "Hello," in Chinese. Ni hao! Hey! Don't rain on this happy occasion with your presence! Where've you been?! Well, last night I rescued a frog from inside a well... ...and it turns out it was actually a 4000-year-old Chinese prince... ...under a magic curse. A 4000-year-old Chinese prince? As a reward, he gave me this jar. It's apparently a 4000-year-old Chinese love potion! A 4000-year-old... A 4000-year-old... ...Chinese love potion?! Catch!
