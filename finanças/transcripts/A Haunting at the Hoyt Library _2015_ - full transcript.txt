(eerie music) - My name is Kelly Ferchau. I've worked for the public libraries of Saginaw for 35 years. Working in a library as old as this or any building as old as this, I guess, you always hear about oh, is it haunted? Are there ghosts? Do you ever experienced anything out of the ordinary? (eerie music) Every once in awhile, while we're looking at old newspapers, we might read something where someone actually died in the library, so you know, then you think well, maybe that's that person's spirit is here. (eerie music) - I know there are portions of the library that some of the employees either try to avoid or absolutely avoid because they have experienced paranormal activity and were very upset by it. (eerie music) - To me, this is one of the creepiest areas of the library. I cannot come down here without getting goose bumps on my arms and the back of my neck. One time I was walking down one of the aisles and there was someone in front of me, no one behind me, and I felt something tugging on the back of my sweater. And that is a feeling that you know what that is. It couldn't have been anything else. There was no one there. I turned around, nothing but darkness. (creepy music) - Hoyt library has a colorful past. People talked about some of the paranormal activity that was happening at Hoyt. You didn't hear it all the time, but one of the things that I heard was that there was a video, a short clip online from Hoyt library, of a chair in the basement, and it was just spinning. And so I did go out on the Internet and I looked at that and I was quite amazed by it. Because at that time I wasn't terribly interested the paranormal. I can't really say that I believed in ghosts, but I didn't disbelieve. I'm a believer now. (drum booms) - Right now, we're headed into the fiction room. This originally was the reading room. I've only heard one story about there being an encounter here. A patron a few years ago was down here looking at works of fiction, and there was a little girl sitting here, a little blond girl, about four years old. And all I could think is that maybe it's a little girl who's waiting for story time. When this section of the library was the children's department, and the librarian would sit here on the floor with the children and read them a story. (eerie music) - The area that we're in now is called the tech attic. This is really a storage area for the library. This is probably the most active and most disturbing of all the places in the library where people have experienced some kind of haunting. This particular room has had everything happen from books moving by themselves on the shelf, footsteps that sound like someone with hobnail shoes walking around, when there's no one in the room, to lights being messed around with, turned on, turned off. When you hit the switch, the lights go on one way, and then they go off, and the only other light switch is at the bottom of the stairs. - [Man] When was the last time that happened? - Just now, actually, when we came in the room. (laughs) Yeah, I'm a little bit creeped out by it right now. - This the Michigan room. Several people who work here don't like going into this room. In 2010, I was here. It was late at night. The library was about ready to close, and I was working at the desk. I looked up and going across inside the room was the shadow figure of a woman in a long dress. She just went from this side to that side and that's all there was. Here on the grand staircase when I leave at night and other people leave at night we always had a feeling that somebody is up on the landing, just staring at us, waiting for us to leave. And I never look back and I never look at the window, just in case there's a reflection. We always get this feeling that we, the living, we have the building during the day and there's like a shift change when we close the building at night. And sometimes I think they're a little bit more anxious to get the building to themselves and you just feel it when I walk down the stairs that it's time for us all to leave. (haunting music) (eerie music) - One of the things that I find so fascinating about this location specifically is how many different spirits are said to haunt the Hoyt library. How many different apparitions have been identified. And one has to wonder, how could there be so many ghosts trapped within the walls of one building like that. What's the cause of that? And one of the theories I have is you gotta consider multiple things. The land that the Hoyt was built on at one point used to be a jail where many people were murdered violently in the 1800s. On top of that, people have died here since it's been a library, so you've got to wonder if that plays a part. And it's also a theory that spirits can be attached to certain objects, and the Hoyt has one of the biggest collections, if not the biggest collection of Saginaw history and Saginaw's past. So all of this together could really account for why there's been so many different things seen within this building. We just want to find the answers. We want to document and get some evidence. - The hard drives on all the digital recorders have been wiped clean. We're ready to record all night. We've got fully charged infrared lights and fresh batteries in all the rest of the gear. The tripod cameras have been set up. And that's actually one of the biggest challenges that we have this evening is the building itself is so large, we have more rooms than we have cameras. But we've got the live feed broadcasting in here. And with all the stories that we've heard about this building, with all the history behind it, I know it's gonna be a good investigation. I'm ready to go. - Looking at this picture, I can imagine the amount of blood, sweat, and tears that went into creating this building. Especially when you get into all these little detailed carvings in the archway and all on the exterior of this building. Kind of makes you wonder if any of these gentlemen have returned and they're the source of the paranormal activity that the staff here at the library are experiencing. - I'm really excited about this investigation. I've heard rumors that this place is haunted for years. Read all kinds of articles in the paper. Heard all kinds of stories. We've got employees who have given us eyewitness claims. We just want to validate those on both audio and video. We owe it to them. One of the things that's most exciting about this is we've never had a place where there's so many professional people who've come forward and stake their reputation on the stories that they're telling us, being in our documentary and all. I can't wait to see what we find. (haunting music) (drum booms) (dramatic orchestral music) - Alright, guys, this is one of the biggest places we've ever investigated. Thousands of square feet, multiple floors, and dozens of different rooms. The only possible way that we're gonna cover all this ground before the sun comes up, we all need to split up and go our own way. Just be cautious. Be careful walking around here in the dark. Stay in radio communication. Now, this is important. Severe thunderstorm warnings have been issued for tonight. There's warnings all over the radio and TV. We all know that thunderstorms cause a huge spike in the electromagnetic field, giving spirits more energy to manifest. Alright, that being said, we're all geared up. We've got the guys on the monitors here. I'm ready to go. You ready? - Good. - [Steve] Tim? Josh? - Ready. - Alright, let's go. Hoyt Library investigation. Let's do it. (intense orchestral music) (spooky music) (haunting music) (drum booms) - This is Tim. EVP session on the mezzanine. Do you enjoy seeing people come through here? Remind you of when you worked here? Or remind you of when you frequented here? I gotta say, this is a pretty cool building. A lot of photographs in here. Lots of generations have been through here. - The reports of activity in this vicinity of the building is that an angry man has been sighted on this staircase and up on the landing as well. They say that they hear his boots stomping up and down the stairs, just really heavy footsteps and they get a negative vibe and just kind of feel unwanted in this area when he's around. So let's try and establish contact and figure out what's happening here. (spooky music) (equipment humming) - Hello? (equipment humming) Is there anyone down here with me? - I can only imagine how lonely it would be in here, year after year, wandering. Maybe you're confused. Maybe you don't realize that you're in a cycle of day after day. I couldn't imagine that. - People that have to use this stairwell have complained that you make them feel nervous, anxious, and flat out frightened. Being that they work here and that they have to use these stairs, you can see where that's a problem. Some of them like to refer to you as the bully. They say that you make them feel intimidated. So I'm not going to label you that way until I have some kind of interaction with you. And at the same time, I do want to tell you that you're not gonna bully me off these stairs. - Heard a lot about this room. (equipment humming) Tools get moved around. Are you working on something? (spooky silence) - Are you playing games? I enjoy games. (switch clicks) Okay. - They say by the period-type clothing they've seen you in and the heavy boots, they feel like you're one of the older spirits here at the Hoyt Library. That being said, you probably have more of a right to be here than I, so if I seem confrontational it's only because I want to maybe provoke you to come out. (spooky silence) Do you like having the reputation of being a creeper? (static and garbled voices from stereo) (silence) - That was creepy. (drum booms) (static) (distorted pulsing) (drum booms) (creepy music) (police siren) - This is the microfiche room. What microfiche is is an archival system that was developed for documenting and chronicling newspapers from the last century on film. People can use it to do research on their family, burial plots, obituaries, and things of that nature. This is one of the most active rooms in the entire library. In fact, one year during their annual fundraiser, A Haunting at the Hoyt, there was a tour that came through and the tour guide brought a group in here. And while he was describing to them some of the activity that would happen, sure enough, computers started turning on, electronics went haywire. And the people in the group got so frightened, they left the room, got in their cars, and went home. - The people that work down here have told us they know you're here. That somebody's here. They feel that you're always standing right behind them while they're working. Even walking behind them as they travel through this space. They'd like us to try and obtain some answers on who you are, what you're doing down here. - Librarians have stated that they can hear floorboards creaking up here when they're getting ready to close down for the day, almost as if someone is pacing back an forth. Some have even said they've heard a female voice. (camera shutter clicks) - I'm here to document some of the claims (camera shutter clicks) that I've heard about this room. Computers turning on. Screens being activated. Pretty outrageous claims. But if you could do that for me tonight, that'd be pretty special. (camera shutter clicks) Could you move something for me? (camera shutter clicks) - Do you like the employees down here? (eerie silence) Or perhaps maybe you feel like this is your space and you don't like them being down here? (eerie silence) You know, I've got a feeling you've been here a lot longer than all these computers and all this technology. If you could try to tell me what this portion of the basement used to be used for or why it's important to you, that could help tell us a lot. Maybe resolve a conflict, if indeed there is one. - Maybe you can tell me why you're pacing back and forth. (creepy music) Are you waiting for someone? Or something? - [Man] Upon the initial review of this footage, we believed the flickering lights to be lightning from the storm outside. Taking a second look, we realized something was actually tampering with the lights in the fiction room down below. Observe the slow motion replay. (creepy music) (static) - You know, one thing I gotta point out here is, especially looking at this tower, there's a lot of high voltage electronics down here. And side effects of a high EMF field such as this is paranoia, feeling of being watched, and if you're supersensitive to it, even nausea. So if you're down here putting in eight, nine hour shifts five, six days a week, it could probably be pretty intense. That could describe why they feel that way or why I feel that way right now even. But on the other hand, there's definitely-- (fluorescent bulb buzzes) (switch clicks) You getting this? (eerie silence) (drum booms) (distorted pulsing) (thunder booming) (suspenseful orchestral music) (cymbals crashing) (drum booms) (footsteps) - This is Prozak now entering the fiction room. (switch clicks) Stormy Weather, tell me about it. (floor creaks) (haunting music) So, as I said, this is now known as the fiction room, but nearly 100 years ago, this was referred to as the children's section. Over here by the fireplace, you'd have a teacher or possibly a librarian who would be over here reading stories to a small group of children who would be gathered over here in front of the fireplace, listening to stories and playing games. How that really correlates to modern day is employees will swear they hear giggling, laughter, they'll hear little feet running up and down the aisles here when they're about to close. And an apparition of a little girl in a white dress has been seen by dozens of employees over the decades. Let's see if we can make contact. (elevator doors rumbling) - We got a motion detector going off in the government documents room, let's go. (door handle clicks) (intensifying creepy music) (door slams) (intensifying creepy music) (alarm siren gets louder) (silence) Nothing looks out of place. I don't see any books that have fallen. Something must have crossed in front of that beam to set off the alarm. (haunting music) It looks like someone was a little curious about this device that was set up by one of our team members earlier. I imagine it must have startled you when it went off. Let's reset it. (beep) - You're probably wondering who the big stranger is here shining a bright light around. I don't mean to shine it in your face, if I am. Then again, I can't see you. Can you tell me what stories used to be read here? And in front of the old fireplace? Maybe what your favorite book was? What kind of games did you guys used to play? It's a pretty big room. It'd be perfect for a good ole game of hide-and-seek. (eerie silence) I feel like we've been playing hide and seek all night. Door over here. I tell you what. We can play a game. I'm gonna knock on something and if one of you can knock back, I've got a present here on my shoulder that I'll leave for you guys to play with. Sound fun? Let's try it. I'm gonna knock. If you can knock back, I'm gonna leave this gift. (knocking) - Are you avoiding me? (thumping) (paper rustling) - Come on. You know, just before we came in this room, I was grabbing my flashlight here and my recorder to come in here and we heard little feet running through the room, much like many of the people at the Hoyt have heard, so we know somebody's in here. I'm gonna knock one more time. If you knock back, like I said, I'm gonna give you a present, okay? I promise. It's toy, you'll love it. Let's try it one more time. (knocking) - Is there something about this book in particular that you wanted me to see? Maybe (switch clicks) you're just trying to get my attention. (alarm wailing) (silence) (intensifying music) Really? - You guys must not want-- (thump) Okay. So maybe we are playing hide-and-go-seek. Can you do that one more time so I can tell where it's coming from? (knocking) (total silence) (distant voice) (drum booms) The childlike laugh had actually startled me. Catching the audio evidence solidified that there was indeed a spirit interacting with me in the fiction room. Perhaps this was the infamous little girl in the white dress seen by staff and patrons alike. (distorted voice) Okay, well, a deal's a deal. As promised, I got a gift that I'm gonna leave over by the fireplace. I'm not sure who's knocking, but if it's the little girl in the white dress, (unzipping) I think I have something real special. I have a little girl in a white dress here in my hand. She's over 100 years old. (music box playing) The only problem is I don't have a name picked out for her. She didn't come with one. So I'm gonna leave this here (music box playing) and feel free to come play with her or whatever you'd like to do. (music box playing) (drum booms) (total silence) (clicking) (hum of monitor turning on) (thunder booming) (raining) (eerie music) (haunting music) This is Prozak entering the local history and genealogy department. So, this is one of the most active portions of the library upstairs here. There's been reports of an apparition by many that is said to haunt this location. As well as many stories of many paranormal events that have taken place. Let's see what we can find. (elevator door thumps closed) (drum booms) So this is probably my favorite story that I've heard about this building, period. They were doing some renovations and they had an electrician come in to install some wire in here. And as the electrician stuck his hand in the hole to connect these wires, he felt an ice cold hand grab his and just squeeze it. The man screamed, threw his tools, and just ran out of the building. (haunting music) - I'm here to establish contact with the man who's said to haunt this wing of the library. (haunting music) The staff described you as a very well-dressed man in a suit. (haunting music) Are you the architect? Or the designer of the Hoyt? - I'm told there's an apparition that dwells up here that's referred to as the helpful librarian. The patrons of the Hoyt Library will come up here to research or perhaps work on a project and on the way out, they'd like to thank the old woman who was so helpful and nice. The only problem with this is there is no woman that works up here. So I'd like to ask you if you could perhaps help me. Me and my friends are working on a project ourselves about the strange and unusual things that happen at the historic Hoyt Library. - You can answer some questions for me. Maybe help me and the staff better understand who you are, what draws you here. (thump) Is that you in the corner? You don't have to be frightened. I'm not trying to corner you. Come toward the sound of my voice. Or maybe come take a seat and the two of us could-- (haunting music) Dude! (drum booms) (static) - [Man] Nobody was in the auditorium except Tim and the cameraman. Recall Tim sliding the chair out from the desk upon entering and facing it toward the room before conducting his EVP session. (haunting music) When he turns back to his seat, he is astonished to find it returned to its original place. (haunting music) - Jesse Hoyt was president of the Pere Marquette Railroad for eight years, until he passed away. That's better known as the Potter Street Station. I know it's late. It's after hours. But I could sure use some advice or some direction. Where might I search in this building for the answers that myself, my team, and the staff are looking for? CK Eddy, very prominent member of early Saginaw society. This room is dedicated to the memory of Harriet Hough Ames, the first librarian of the Hoyt Library. Harriet, is that you? Are you in fact the helpful librarian? I apologize for making assumptions. If that's not your name, please correct me. Did you hear that? (drum booms) It seems my talking aloud had disgruntled the spirit that is said to haunt the history and genealogy department of the Hoyt Library. (distant distorted hushing) (static) (switch clicks) (switch clicks) (switch clicks) (switch clicks) (drum booms) (drum booms) (thumping) (thumping) (drum booms) This is crazy. - [Adam] Yeah. - I mean, I expected a lot of of the Hoyt Library, but I cannot believe how much evidence we've already caught. I don't know if it's the storm or what it is. So I called you up here because I want to send you up to the attic. - [Adam] Okay. - [Steve] Okay, now the attic has been virtually untouched for the last 125 years. - [Adam] Perfect. - [Steve] So therefore, if there are spirits in that part of the building, they're not used to people walking around and going through there. So really dig in that attic and go in all the nooks and crannies and see what you can kick loose up there. - Definitely. - Also, that being said, be careful up there. Because I'm not sure about how it is structurally. I'm gonna head down into the basement into the archive. That's where all the things are collected and stored here at the Hoyt, and for that reason I feel like who knows what I might encounter? But keep in contact with me on the radio, let me know how it is, and let's keep it going. - Let's do it. (thunder cracks and rumbles) (raining) (clanking) (intense creepy music) - So we're down to the archives right now. This is the most feared location in the Hoyt Library. Employees will make almost any excuse to not come down here for any reason. Could be attributed to the old relics that were stored here, the oldest things that the Hoyt has in their collection is stored here, a lot of things symbolic to death. Obituaries, funeral directories, grave plots, the list goes on. It's also tucked away in the darkest corner, so I can understand why people would be afraid to come back here. However, they believe there is something here. Let's see what we can find. (creepy music) Is anybody here with me? (creepy music) (camera beeping and shutter clicking) Pardon my intrusion. Got flashing lights and somebody talking in a loud tone in a library. I could understand how that would seem disrespectful, but I assure you it's not. Saginaw evening news, 1890. - This is Adam heading into the attic of the Hoyt library. (creaking) Oh, really watch your head in here. (clanking) Shoot, I just dropped my recorder. (shuffling) (grunting) I can't even feel it down there. I think it goes down pretty far. (sighing) I don't know if I'm gonna be able to get it. I found it! Sorry, did I scare you? Sorry, come on. - People are very afraid to come down here. And I'm here to try to figure out why. I know it's a spooky portion of the building. (camera shutter clicking) But the people that work here swear it's more than just that. They feel that they're not alone when they are here. Some of these dates on these books go back 150 years. - Oh, wow. This must be for the skylight. Take a look in there. (clank) - Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Steve. And I'm here just for tonight. I'm here to try to find answers for the staff of the Hoyt library who swear there are supernatural events taking place throughout the building, and particularly this room. (camera shutter clicking) Can you show yourself to me? I promise I won't be afraid, nor will I be startled. You can move an object. You can use your voice to try to speak or communicate. Anything you feel comfortable with doing. (thump) (camera shutter clicking) - You gotta be careful up here. (clicking) (static) - You can follow me if you want. You can stand in front of me. You can tap me on the shoulder. I'm here as a friend of the library to try to reach out to you. Maybe there's more than one of you. That's fine, too. - Hello? (creepy music) Who's up here? (creepy music) Did you want us to come in this room? (creepy music) Are you trying to lead us somewhere? - Oh my god. (eerie music) It's got plastic on it, so I think I can touch it. (rustling) Carried by a BC Carter through the Civil War. He was a member of the First Michigan Engineer and Mechanic's Regiment. Wow, look at this, the history that we're in right now. I mean, somebody carried this object through the entire Civil War. Just a little piece of home. Imagine the sentimental value that this has, that all these objects have, and you wonder why this is the most active portion of the building. (eerie music) (drum booms) (total silence) (drum booms) (spooky silence) (raining) That's weird. Just felt like something kind of brushing in the face here. Kind of felt like cobwebs, but not quite cobwebs. But I don't feel anything. I don't see anything here. Felt weird. Hello? The folks that work down here, there's only three offices in this particular department and they're all pretty nervous about working here. This is known to be definitely one of the most haunted sections. I know we say that a lot during this investigation, but there are so many spots and so many rooms with activity here. So many different claims. So this is one of the older parts of the building. I'm guessing it has some of the oldest spirits. A lot of things from the past here collected and stored. Maybe you have some interest? Maybe these things remind you of your particular time frame? Things that you're familiar with? (switch clicks) East Saginaw. - I've had the opportunity to speak with several of the nice people that work down here. They say they can sense your presence. (spooky silence) Sometimes their belongings will go missing. Turn up in a different part of the office. Sometimes never at all. - Look at this, old dumbwaiter. All the old buildings had these. Made people's lives a lot easier, sending things up and down the little elevator instead of carrying heavy things up the steps. (clanking) Makes perfect sense in a library with all those heavy books. - Earlier in the night, when we were given the tour, I guess one of the employees that work in this office here was digitizing some old film cans that were donated by a private collector of Old Saginaw City. And while he was processing, digitizing these films, a very prominent figure of Saginaw's past, when his name would be mentioned, this light here above where he was seated, would begin to flicker. At first, he thought okay well, maybe it's just a coincidence. Well, after five or six times of this happening, he started to get pretty spooked out. And the gentleman told us that about another dozen times throughout these films, it would continue to happen, only when his name was mentioned. So that's pretty spooky. - Do you like having the company of the staff down here? Or maybe you like it better when they leave? (clicking) Typing? (clicking) Hello? It stopped. - Now that is real creepy. Look at this. These are all the collections of where people are buried, all the old cemeteries. We have Forest Lawn, see several others down here. (haunting music) Even got some film cans here. Saginaw city cemeteries. It's amazing. You're literally looking at thousands of people's resting places. - Excuse me. (curtain rustling) - I'm sure you've witnessed quite a bit of change in this library. Do you like change? Or do you prefer things the way they used to be? (static) (pulsing) (creepy music) (creaking) (drum booms) - [Man] After reviewing all the footage from the infrared stationary cameras, we found ourselves in total disbelief. Finally, after all the stories and eyewitness claims, we had visual evidence of the spirit referred to as the helpful librarian. (distorted pulsing) (drum booms) - I know a lot of heart and soul was put into the creation of this building. I say building, it's much more than just a building to the community, to myself, the staff. It's a big part of our history here in Saginaw. So I know some of that heart and soul has to remain, the energy has to remain here. If there's anything that anyone would like to say or a message perhaps, please feel free to speak to me and trust that I am a friend here. We're only going to be visiting just for tonight. And then I promise you, the nights will go back to being quiet, peaceful, and most of all go back to being yours. I know there's been others that have come here, probably asked you similar questions and asked you to do similar things. (drum booms) (distorted pulsing) (drum booms) (distorted pulsing) This would be a beautiful place to spend eternity. (eerie music) And I could understand that. (eerie music) The people that work here, it's not that they're afraid, they would just love to know more about why you're here. They love the building as much as you do. And I think if you guys could somehow connect it could be even a better experience for both. They definitely respect you. They view the spirits, for the most part, of the Hoyt to be very kind and part of the building that it is, the historic Hoyt library. (drum booms) (eerie music) (drum booms)
