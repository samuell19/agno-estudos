"I don't know about treasure," he said, "but I'll stake my wig there's fever here." How old are you? - I'm 14. - I'm 13. - 13, 15, 11... You can't come in. - Why? - You're under age. - We've not been not on holiday. - No. - Look... - You're under age. We've not been on holiday. We've travelled 3 hours. We lived in Argenteuil. We'd really like to come in. Yes, but you're under age. Go home. Come back with your parents. - Then you can come in. - But our parents are really... - You can't come in. - Our parents are trying to work. - No. - They're in difficulty. - Life's hard. - We have cash. - Listen here. - Yes? We, the adults, decide here, not the children. - I decide here. - You don't. We do security. If we say yes, it's yes. - No, is no. - Ok. - Go down there. - Give over. Let's hide our t-shirts here and get in the water - No! - What if they see us? - I won't do it. Come down here. - Security'll get us. - I'm keeping my t-shirt on. - We'll go to prison. - Hide your t-shirts. I'm taking mine. Take your flip-flops. Where do we go from here? I'm taking my flip-flops. We'll come up, looking natural. I'm not getting in. Careful, it's deep. Yes, madam. Don't worry. We're professionals. Don't worry. Go on, jump. - Jump then. - No, don't jump. Ahh, be jumped! Ah, the nutter! - Jump in, it's warm. Come on, Sid. Come on, Nassim. Shit, there's stones. Is there something there? Who gives a toss! - Keep down. - Wait. Get down. Wait here. We're gonna get told off. Slowly, quietly. There's nobody - Come on. - People are looking. - Slow down. - Act like nothing's up. We'll say you went for a wee. There's no one. One at a time. Steady. As if nothing's up. Act innocent. Come on ads! We've shot in like rockets! THE TREASURE ISLAND He's mad! Your hat! What did he do? About the alert level for this week and next weekend. As of Wednesday, it's going to get tough Yes, very. It'll be around 30. Careful. It'll feel 2 degrees hotter, so that's 28? on Tuesday, so if I'm right that's 32?. - Yeh. - 32? Wednesday. So, really hot. So, Wednesday we'll roll out the red carpet. I'll do a weekend sheet to send... - Yes. - 34? perceived Wednesday. It'll be busy Wednesday, comparable to a weekend day. So I'll do a heat wave alert for Wednesday. - I'll send it to all the authorities. - Yes. We came through the entry. It's nor us. You're going to have to leave now. No. But we paid. You didn't pay. You didn't. - But we paid. - You didn't pay. You were seen. There are cameras. But we paid. It took us 3 hours to get here. - Show me your payment receipt. - We threw it away. You were told to keep your receipt on payment. - We threw it away. - What for? Why did you bin it? - You shouldn't bin receipts. - The guy from security kept it. He said he threw it away. What did you just say? We showed it security then binned it. Ah, Yes. - Are you sure of that? - Yes. - Where are your clothes? - Hidden? What for? Where? - We came dressed like this. - People might steal them. We came like this. We've got no adults with us. How old are you? I'm 14, he's 15, and he's 15. You said you were 10, now you're 14. Come on. I'll give you 4 euros. - Bye. Have a good day. - Good day! Obey the rules next time. They're racists. They've got the same colour skin as us. They're not racists. They just found out that we sneaked in That's all. They chucked us out and that's all. Thank you! The beach! I jumped from the 5th level. I jumped in the water. Out the window! Let's do this one. It's great! Nico, let's, do it together. It goes down, turns and you land in the water. Wait. I'll tell you when to go. Hold the bar. - Hold the bar! - Wow! Don't worry. Hold the bar. You can go. Go! Let go. You'll slow yourself down. Let go. Lie down. You'll go quicker. Lie down. You'll go quicker. - Hello. Hi. How are you? - 3 tickets please. - 15 please. 15. But it's 5 o'clock. It's that same price all day. - What time does it close. - 7pm. Not at 6.30? Pool closes at 6.30. We close at 7. 15 for an hour. That's expensive. It's 5 each, and... - Less, if I give you my number? - No, thank you. - How about me. - Still not. - Not at all? - No. - No point trying harder? - No. Right. We'll pay 3 tickets then. - 15 then. - By card please. That's fine. - This is yours. - Thanks. - Good afternoon. - Bye. - I'll be black for the number. - Okay. Me too! - Maybe next time. - Yeh. Next time? You're a bit hasty. If I don't have your number, how can we meet? - I don't know. - We have to find a way. Give them your snap. - That bothers you too? - Dunno. I'm not giving it. She might. I'm not either, Right. Never mind. - Why so uptight? Don't trust men? - I've got a boyfriend. - I don't trust men. - No? No. We know what you're like. There's exceptions. That's not you. You come up, hit on us. - How d'you know? - You can see. It's because we find you pretty. Are there many you find pretty. Yeh, lots. But we don't talk to all the girls. You wouldn't think. Yeh well. Pity... - That's coz you're hit on often. - No. - Not even? - No. Well, if you've got a boyfriend, no need. No, no need. - We're off then. - Yeh alright. - Bye. - Bye. They're polite, they said goodbye. Apparently. - Why didn't you give your snap? - No way! You don't trust men. They seemed nice. Yeh, seemed is the word. Off the chair, please. - Why? - It's for us. Just foe me? Just for the lifeguards, sorry. He's a pain. I'm nice. Your shorts go with the parasol. I did it on purpose to please you. Doesn't do it. He copies me. No personality! I need to go now. - Can't you stay? - No, sorry. - With me? - No, neither. Sorry. I'm off. You get ready I'll see you later. No, not at all. - Can I get your number. - No way. You here tomorrow? I'm here every day. I'll come and look for you. - Can we help. - No thanks. I like fit women. Right, beautiful, see you tomorrow. Can we kiss goodbye? All right, but that's all. - A kiss on the lips, French Kiss? - No, no. Bye, boys. Ladies and gents, your attention please It's 6,15. The bathing zone closes in 15 minutes. Thank you. I can't wait to be 10. You have time. Don't be in a hurry. - I am. - You've got plenty of time. - You've time to grow up. Don't rush. - Yes! When you're older, you want to be younger. I'd like to be a masseuse. Or several other obs. You're still young to choose. You change all the time. I like hairdresser, or... working for Lidl, for example. - You want to work on a check-out? - Yes! That's a nice job. It's long hours, Saturdays and Sundays. - No, then. - Ah, yes. Some jobs you work weekends. I want to work Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday. Good luck with that then. I'd like to work those days. Even Monday to Friday with my weekend off would be good. If you want holidays, be a teacher. You'll get the same holidays you do now. It only opens at noon at the moment. What a pain! - Let's have a walk. - Oh! - We're not waiting here 2 hours, Mandy. - Two hours? His eyes are scary. I can't see them. See. They're sort of light blue, light green. He's scary. - He's washing. - Yuk! You wash. He needs to wash too. I don't wash with my tongue. He hasn't got any choice. - Really? - No. - Why's he rolling up. - He's happy. Get off! He's happy. - The water's like that. - Oh, it's cold! Stop it! Are we going to the toilet? I'm not going to the loo. There's too many people. You're all warm! And you're all cold! - How was the swim, lads? - The water's dirty! Ah, yeh... - Can I jump here? - It's not a good idea. You're not allowed. You can't swim here. - Oh come on! - That's the way it is. There's nobody to watch over you. Yeh... You've been for a dip already. They look like 2 magazine pinups. They know we're talking about them. Watch them smiling. Nice pose mate, you're doing great. Yeh, don't move mate. you look just right. You in advertising lads? For which brand? - Any brand. - Don't say any brand. You need to have your mind set on something. As long as it plays. You can get dragged into weird stuff though. Yeh, you need to preserve your integrity, right. They look like lads who want to jump. I think they're all waiting to jump. I think we've picked up on them. There's nowhere deep to jump though. Where you jump and wonder if you'll die. We want an adrenaline rush. People get killed over adrenaline, lads. Sone people die stepping off the pavement. Yeh, you can die from nothing. Like jumping off a bridge. Or from heat. Gotta keep cool! How many have died jumping off this bridge? There's no point taking numbers. The police told me it was just 1 death, years ago. He dived in, caught his feet on a grate. So you know there's a grate. His feet got stuck. He didn't come back up. They've cleaned the lake since! How d'you know? The police! The law enforcement. I hope you'll think back and remember we were nice about this. You've given us a useful lesson. It's alright mate. No problem mate. Everything's cool then. Barbecue tonight? Not tonight, no. We'll chill in the park. We're gonna stay till about 9. Until the sun sets. Then we'll head home and off to work. - You gonna cook your dinner. - No we're straight off to work. - Where do you work? - Uber. They've cone. Can we jump from here? Yeh, yeh, you're allowed. Right, as regards security. The CODIS called me at 7 pm as I was leaving yesterday, to tell me someone was drowning. So I back tracked. The fire brigade came in to actively search for the victim, who was conscious and had been helped out by a by stander. We found the person in Oscar 11 on Plage des Chiens de Terre Neuve. We had the police, an inquiry. It was a man around 30 or 40, hard to tell his age. He'd been drinking heavily. A person out doing some sport spotted him and rescued him. Re the remark we had just about pets in the water craft, exotic pets, that's anything but cats and dogs, so snakes, exotic birds... - Parrots... - Rats. Everything but cats and dogs... The rule, if you're faced with this when you're duty manager, is that they are strictly forbidden in public zones and a sanitary authorization is necessary for their transport. - We won't call the police for a rat. - Or a mouse. Not for a rat on their shoulder. But parrots can be dangerous. Rats can bite. A rat won't fly onto your neighbour's head. - They can jump. - If you like. You can call the police for rats if you like. We mustn't make exceptions. The main problem is exotic animals, and in particular, snakes. We've had several issues and we can't let snakes in even if people say they're inoffensive. The rule is they need sanitary authorisation. For all exotic pets. Hi kids. You're not supposed to swim here. The young man is soaking wet. Feet only. Just your feet. Back to the shore. Go back to the shore, please. - We're having a water fight. - Okay, only up to your feet. Thanks. Lads, no swimming here. - Alright. - Can you go back to the shore. Thanks. - Can we stay in by the shore? - Up to your feet. Thanks. And here he comes... The dog's worried to see its masters in the water. So I went alone as nobody else could come. The second day, on the beach, I had a free sunbed, provided by the hotel, a girl comes along I've her photos on my phone. A very pretty girl. Dark hair. Young. And she puts down her towel touching my sunbed. I said nothing. I saw she was reading French. So I asked, "Do you speak French?" She said "Yes. I'm waiting for a friend. We're at the youth hostel." We chatted all afternoon. She stayed for sunset. I didn't understand straight away. I said, "Look, it's cold". In the evenings it was chilly. I said, "You can use the hotel spa and pool, get a massage and all that." She said, "Great". And fetched her friend. Well, after that, I said "What are you doing later?" No ulterior motives. She said, "Finding a cheap place to eat." I said, "Come to the hotel restaurant. My treat." It was 5 star. We had a great time, a bottle of the best Croatian wine, Dujnac. They went off after a kiss on the cheek. They said thanks. She said, "What's breakfast like here?" I said, "They have a sumptuous spread for 100 kunas." That's about 10 euros. She said, "If we're nearby tomorrow, we might come in. I said, "It fills you up for the day." The next day, one came back alone. So we had breakfast. She said, "It's much better than the hostel." I thought, "Well, well". She asked to visit the hotel and my room. Nothing happened. Throughout the whole trip. So I showed her the hotel that I know like the back of my hand. I showed her my room with its beautiful view of the bay. She said, "It's so much better than the hostel." I said, "Look. I'm bored. I planned to be here with friends". "If you like, you can stay here." She accepted straight off. She turned up 2 hours later with all her stuff. She slept in my room till the end. I'm 72. She was 20. So what went on? She'd thought, "This old bloke's on his own, got pots of money." She took advantage. I knew what was going on when she asked to stay. You have to be daft not to. She was adorable kept me company the whole time. She was nice. A sort of Japanese geisha. So I wasn't alone. She stayed in a 5 star hotel. You might think, "the dirty old perv shagging young girls." It was platonic. I haven't slept with a women since 2006. I'd chatted up a Russian woman. That was a different kettle of fish. It was nice to have company. She could have been my granddaughter. Me 72, her 20... I would have been ashamed to take advantage. - Why are you lying? - Kiss her, Reda. - We're off. See ya. - See ya. - Bye. - Bye. Answer his snaps, right. You haven't added me. come and see. You haven't added me. - You haven't added me. - I did. Look. Let's see. He's got no network. He's got 2G++. I've got 4G. It's alright. It worked. He'll start talking to you the day after tomorrow. Answer me though. I'm a nice lad, not like... - She's 14. - My granddad married at 16. My gran was 14. Mine was 12. My granddad was 17. See. It doesn't matter. It's 2 years. It's good, doing what your grandparents did. When you're 27. and she's 25, there's no difference. Spend 10 years with her already. You know my parents' age difference? - No? - 11 years. I'm going to see her again. I don't care. She's really pretty. If you had her snap you'd see her again. You were quicker than me. I wanted to ask her. I wanted it too. You were quicker. Why didn't you ask the other one. - Not your type? - It's not that. Your one was prettier. - Your, she was prettier. - Ah, her eyes. She's over there, watching. Emma's watching. He came straight out. Back flip. Go on. Now he's out the water. I bet that hurt. You alright? Do a back flip for Emma. She'll be all yours. Do us a good one this time. His feet are 6 or 7 metres above water. Straighten your legs. Do Superman! You lost an eye. It's here. Oh my balls! You lost an eyebrow! My head hurts. This is not possible. - I've had it. Do us a flip, matte. - I cannot anymore. Come over this way. There we go. - You alright, Reda? - So, what did you think? - Reda, what did you think? - He's suffering! - Reda, Reda... - Wait. You're all red. I'll never have kids. I want to have children, with Emma. Hello, ladies, gents, youngsters. I hope you have a good afternoon. It's 27 right now. They're saying it'll be hotter tomorrow, 30. It would be great, if it could last. It bring us some money. I'm the driver. and my name's Pierrot, Pierre. My friends call me Pierrot. When I was a kid, like everyone, my parents got me a locomotive, one of the first. As luck would have it, 50 years later, I'm driving real one. They forgot the rails though... We'll arrive at the main entry. This is the terminus for everyone. On the right, that's where you can rent pedalos. It's the only spot you can go for a pedalo trip. There's my colleague on the left, doing nothing much, getting a tan. He's a nice bloke though. ?3.50! Terminus. Everyone off, please. Is it a coypu? Oh, a water hen? Did it shit on you? No there's blood coming out its mouth. - Is it a water hen? - No, it's a duck. - What sort of duck that? - Dunno, but it's... - It's disgusting! - Don't touch that with it. - Not too hot? - I'm scared I'll fall out. Thanks. That's water on my hand. - Was it good? - Yeh, it was. Is it you first time here? My second, her first. - My first time. - In the park? - Yeh. - You're from? - Rambouillet. - Rambouillet. There's a forest there. If you want, you can stay this evening. We're going to the ski-tow. We can meet up. You can visit. We can hang out. We're a group. We're going to dive off the pylons. I don't know if I'll jump. - We'll watch, that's fine. - Sure. Good. I'm up for that. - What time you here till? - We didn't really set a time. - What time shall we meet? - /, 7.30. We finish around 7. - Yeh, 7's good. - Yeh. - That's good for you? - Yeh. I'm Jeremy, and you? - Lisa. - Anissa. Nice to meet you. I'll wrap that up. - Here's your pass. - Thanks. See you later. Enjoy the park. It's wet! It's burning hot! Put water under your bottom. Gary, can deal with these? Can I get some water? - Are they alone? - I don't want to pedal. I'll pedal. And I'll steer too. I don't want to! He's going quick! - You push. Ready? - Yes. Turn right. Well done. You managing? Alright, turn. We're there. We're there! - Come on. - Where are they? Quick! Are you Managing? - It's too quick! - Pedal. - Are we all good? - Yes. We're almost there! We all paddle! Where've you put the paddle?! Under the coconut tree! The crocodile ate it! And we can't paddle anymore! Let's pedal! I thought he was really cute the minute I saw him. Yeh, I could tell straight away. They're making us wait a bit too much though. Send him a message. It's supposed to be girls that keep boys waiting. No... No! Disappointment... I really want to do a flip. No, I'm too scared. Go on. you don't give a toss. - Yeh a flop! - You can say it's sunburn. Depends how I feel. I don't put enough strength into it. I don't know what's missing. - Your back. - Stretch your arms out more. We're sales staff at Zara. - Where? - Rambouillet. - Really? - Yeh. I worked at H&M. It's great, if you have a good team. I think H&M is worse than Zara. - Worse? - Busier. Yeh. You might be right. He's at the top.. You don't dive off pylons after work at Zara. There's no water. - The town fountain! - The old pond in the park. - All mouldy. - Dirty! Try diving. You feel just great after. Your heart beats. You're like, no I can't do it. - You're dressed. Go on, do it. - You jump... - Go on! - Go on! When you hit the water,- Go on! when you go under, put your arms out. - I'll hold my nose. - Hold your nose. Put Just one arm out. You'll go a bit deeper. - Have you jumped before? - Never in your whole life? - It's your first time? Yes. Okay. When you jump... Don't think! Look at the water and just go. Jump straight. Hold on. I've got to film Lisa. - I'm too scared. - You can do it. It's an experience. What's happening is magic. Are you ready? You'll be fine. I promise. We'll jump together. Mouth closed. Teeth clenched. We just need to trust each other. Ready? One, two, three... - That was fab. Life is great. - Fuck! Lisa jumped! There we go. You're squashing me! We're in. Ouch! I banged my head. I thought it was head. - Life's great. - We're good here. I love days like this. I'm gonna get curls like you. It won't go curly coz it's wet. - It's naturally curly. - It's curly? Okay, we're off. You straightened it? You shouldn't. Wait! Don't drive at 50! The sky's clearing. If the weather's good. I'm sure there'll be loads of people. All the better. When you're alone... It's really nice round here. It's a pity they made it a Luna park. With tree top adventures and paying to swim. To my mind, it was better when it was wild. The outlying suburbs were like the country then. The suburbs have really changed and not always for the better. With your eyes shut, you can still imagine that it's paradise on Earth. When I was a teacher, I taught A-level students. They were very nice. We got on well. I got on well with the biology teacher and she organized field trips to study marine life at what was then called Etangs de Neuville. Cergy didn't exist at the time. At the far end there was water already. So as it was always sunny when we did field trips, The students brought along their trunks and we all went for a swim. And the headmaster who was very nice, a young man, said, " Did it go well?" "Did they work hard?" We'd laugh and say yes. Everyone was happy. - Hurry, Amine! - Shut up. What if get caught. That's why. imagine if we're caught. - Don't worry. - Very funny. Come on mate, hurry up! - I bet that hurts. - You're next. Right? It's really hard! How did you get up? Hurry up, Hurry up! As you said! You reckon this is easy! Here, take my bag. Amine, take my bag. I'll put it there. Go on. I don't like this, mate. Tell me what you're trying to do. To start, that's dangerous. It's fraud too. Well, the sky is a bit overcast today. We often come here. But we didn't want to pay today because it's a bit cloudy. 4.50 is a mickey-take. It's not a reason to commit fraud. You're already been here so, you know we're all over the place. Yes. Generally, we don't put up with this. Anyway, what the law calls fraud, you can't call by a different name. - It's fraud. - It's dangerous to stay up there. - You come down already. - Alright. Then, back where you came from. There's just 2 of you? - Yes just us 2. - Right. If we catch you with other people, it won't be the same thing. You'll risk being banned for the whole season. The weather may be bad today, but there'll be sunnier days. - Right? - If we're here, it's because of you. Have you got your ID? - No. - To top it off! - Where do you live? - When you come to swim, you must have your ID. You're under 16? - Yes. - Bring your ID next time. You're not in trouble today, as we said. But next time no messing. - Okay. - Make sure you have cash, and pay, to go to the beach, right. What are your names? - My name is Amine. - And you? - Amine. Amine and Amine. Oh, alright. Amine and Amine. - You're not in trouble this time. - Okay. Next time, we won't be so tolerant. We're looking at 20 cameras, static or motorized. Which isn't much. - Show us on map. - Briefly. Here's the equipment types. In the slide zone are a static and a motorized camera, or 2 static cameras for the surf wave and the ski-tow platform. A camera here at P5 security post, giving 3 angles and the Cayennes pool. Profit centre and access. Yes. This is an access. So of interest to cover. The multisport profit centre, the water stadium with a camera, these are suggestions, on the land spit which will give us a view of the fort and the entry here. The barbecue zone is complicated. There's lots of angles and foliage. We could put one here. Bearing in mind our chart, based on access and profit zones, It makes no sense. It's a busy zone. There are very few issues in that zone. So we didn't really include it. When it's a non-heat wave weekend, there's areas that are overstaffed, for example the pedalo dock where they were 5. I'm wondering. 5 rather free-spirited lads, - left to their own devices. - Okay. At Thursday?s weekly meeting I asked Guillaume to reduce the workforce, as it wasn?t due to be busy. Well he didn't. To top it off, the lads... well... They got told off twice. They were doing, I don't know what... Playing around with a mirror. Kids games. It's not the place for it. And another thing. When they came back to multisports at the end of the day they brought people with them who were nothing to do with the pedalos or the park in general. I went to see them, told them off. I said if the Director comes to tell you off, there's clearly a problem - Did you speak to Guillaume about it? - No. He'd left already. You've paid for 2? We got 2 dad. There's 6 of us. You paid for 2, share those 2. That's right, we paid for 2. Came and sit down. Don't worry. As a special treat, you get 3 pedalos. Thanks, that's nice of you. You'd got it all planned. I don't want to die today. It's magic. They're hidden towns. Careful. I don't like this. My arms are killing me. We'll be alright to dive here. Yeh? It's hiding. Waiting for us. Go on. He'll come, I'm telling you. We can dive in from here. No, not today boys. The ultimate dived! You haven't got your life jackets. I'm worried, if I jump, that'll happen. You need to jump like this. And boom! Hey lads. I can see the end of his willy. It's kind of nice-looking in an arty way. Don't jump into the water jets. - It'll bring you bad luck. - They're gonna drown on the way! One of the bosses lives not far. He can spot us from where he lives. Jeff, Quentin's gonna give us shit after. - Yeh, he already leaves us the keys. - We can't do that, it's by the entry. Yeh, we've come out on the ponds at night with the pedalos. There was 20 of us. 4 pedalos. You drink and all that. It's a bit... You feel full of energy. We went as far as the pyramid and partied on the pyramid. We've taken kayaks out. There were electric boats here at one point. I had the keys. 5 of us took a boat out. There's proper steering, comfy seats. It's the life. It's a laugh. The security guards de their rounds. We know the routes. When they go by, we hide, we crouch down, and they go right by, you're like a champion. We pulled the wool over your eyes. You went right by and saw nothing. When I was little, about 14 or 15, the snack bar in the middle, it had old-fashioned metal shutters. We used a pole to force them open. One went in, got the drink, the sweets, all the biscuits and ice creams. We ran off with bin bags full. One time a guard came along and chased after us. One of my mates ran into the pond, he didn't see it in the dark. Straight into the water, with his gags of ice cream and stuff. That's just magic, unforgettable! It was kid's stuff. We were looking for kicks. We just wanted to have fun. You've got to enjoy life. You don't know what tomorrow brings. If something goes through your mind and you know it's gonna give you a kick you've just got to do it. Even if it means doing something forbidden. Or getting chased after by the police. Most importantly, you feel your heart beating, and you look at your friends and say right now, I'm alive! I dread the thought of leaving here. I think about it often these days. I think it'll be... Abandoning everything familiar, all I've built up here. I know I carry on elsewhere, but... I'm really attached to this place. It's my big garden here. It's okay now it's repaired. Someone could get in here. It's strange. Alright. It's alright 50-50. That's fine. Everything is closed. That's good. Everything's perfect. Unless there's something up. Around 1 or 2 am I'll come back. I was at school. I remember. It was in '84. I met the education minister. His name escapes me. Mr. Bakamou or something. He came as education minister. Not for a political party. He came during morning recreation. Everyone was dressed in school clothes. He was wearing a PUP t-shirt. A political party t-shirt. As a minister. No one was wearing that. What does it mean? The head of the school was there. He didn't dare... Each was scared for his job. I said, "Minister, may I say something?" He said, "Go ahead. On the tip of my lips. Like hot pepper. You put some on and then you're off. I said, "You say education is apolitical. Starting with the director, the teachers, the students. We're all in work clothes, you have a political t-shirt." He said, "Yes well..." After a month, I saw an ordinance. "Gross misconduct." I was fired. From then on they followed me, and threatened me. I went to school but wasn't paid. A month went by with no pay, then two. One day, I went to the ministry. At the gates, I saw a truck. I passed it. They said "Get in" They said, "It's an order, get in." I said, "Oh, really?" "Is that so. What orders?" "Am I a criminal or something?" My colleagues at the Ministry didn't dare speak out. They didn't dare. It's a dictatorship. I got in and... "reported missing". "reported missing..." The next morning they gave me a paper and said, "Read it, we'll film you". And you have to read to save your skin. You say you've attempted a coup d'?tat, or whatever and you have to recognize it. If you don't do it, you're kept in your cell. There's 3, 4, 5 of you. You're not fed. You're obliged to own up. Everything you know, or don't, you have to say. You have to if you want to eat. They arrested my sister because of me, 150 km from Conakry. But they let her go. I thank God they didn't rape her. Finally, they let her go. Nobody expected to see me again. Nobody. Nobody expected me to be alive. God only knows how I managed to get to be here. We're good I've got stones. Right. You can have some. Let's see who can throw it the farthest. - Well done. - I won. Well done. Ah! Wait. Stay up there. Here. Which one do you want? Oops! - Big one or small one. - Small. - Okay. - Oops! Ready? Let's see who throws it farthest. One... two... three... - I did a big circle. - Me too. Let's play hide and seek. I'll count. Hold on. Right, go and hide. One... two... three... four... five... six... seven... eight... nine... ten... Coming! Found you! Your turn. One... two... three... four... seven eight... Found you! Both sides. Look. There's sticks here. I'll teach you colours again. Michael, what colour is this? It's green. - It's good - What colour is this? It's green. It's green and Purple. - It's green and Purple. - What colour's this? - It's orange. - Well done. It's good. What colour is that? Colour... that oooh... - It's not easy to see. - It's white. No. We can't see it very well. In fact, it's blue. Like this. What colour is this? - It's blue. Well done. - What colour is that? - It's pink. What colour is this? - That? Pink. - No, it's red. - A bit pink. - Red. A little bit pink and a little bit red. What colour is this? - I'm not telling you. - It's red. - Black. - I'll look for something black. Red. - Black. - I've found something. Found? Who's my little darling!? The Mujahedeen caught me on the road. I was in a coach. They made me get off and walk 40 minutes from the main road. I was imprisoned for a month. They said I was a communist from Kabul. They dug really deep holes... About 40 metres deep. They stood you by the hole and told you to pray. They stood back 20 metres. They'd shoot you in the head and you'd fall in the hole. Happy birthday! When they stood me by the hole to say my prayer, Just before the guy shot, I heard someone say: "Don't kill the prisoners." They had to dig a canal. So the officer told them not to kill prisoners, to make them do the digging. The canal had to be dug before Ramadan. If he'd come 30 seconds later, I would have been dead. Dad... For one of the last days of the celebration, they got a surprise. We lived in Montauban for two years. They were the hardest years of our lives. We spoke no French and nobody spoke English. There were no translators, no Afghans. Nobody spoke English. - The French didn't. - We learned word by word. We went round with a Farsi-English dictionary. We looked up the words to communicate. The first 6 months you grasp nothing. You arrive in a country. There are cultural problems. It's not like our country. We didn't understand a single word. People spoke to us of cars. We even didn't know the word. There's a town called Monclar 20 Km from Montauban. When we were in Montauban the head of the foyer told us: "An Afghan family has come to Monclar." Dad was still alive, he's dead now. I said to Dad, "Let's go meet them." When we went to see them, We really wanted to see other Afghans. The man was at the top of a hill where there was just one house, and there was a refugee centre there. There were 6 families and not nothing for 15 km around. Nothing but wheat fields. When he saw me, he threw himself my arms and cried. We're still in touch today. He's in the Netherlands now. When he threw himself in my arms, he just cried his eyes out. I asked why. He said, "I'm going to burst, or die." I said, "it's okay". We went back in 2004. 10 years later. It was no longer the same country. The people, everything was different. Everything has changed. We don't feel at home when we go there. This place reminds us... My mum's town was at the top of a hill and a river ran at the bottom. The greenery is exactly the same. It's so beautiful. At the top of the mountain there's a place the only place, where you find a fish you eat from head to tail. You eat the whole fish. There's no bones. They take the fish out of the water, it's covered in little dots of all colours. And the city people, even us, took off the head and tail. The locals laughed because they eat it from head to tail. It's a magnificent place. It's wild, untouched. I hope one day we can invite people to our country. It's our dearest wish. People stay till the last minute. The weather's not even nice. - I got my pay slip. - Me too. I'm not telling you what I got. But I'm sick. I don't care I'm sure I got more. 10.000 times for sure. - Wednesday... - The weather's no good. I'm gonna look for work at the airport. Honestly! You want to work there? I trained to be a security guard. - Where? - Sarcelles. - What? Sarcelles. Not for nothing. How did you find it? Through my educator. I want some training. I've had it with... - In what? - Dunno. I could see you as a cop. - Yeh right. Funny! - I'd have loved it. Ah, it's cool! - You're mad! - What! It's really cool! Police. You'd be surrounded by racists. You're a racist. You see them everywhere. - I don't care! - Firemen, all that, they're racist. I don't care. Nicolas for Benoit. It works. I think it's working. Did you get my message about the storm? I heard some noise. It didn't sound like the side or a plane. So I've got my eyes peeled. I think it's gonna break soon. Ladies and gents, attention please because of the approaching storm, you need to leave the water. Please gather by the toilets. Excuse me. It's over now. You need to come out. Come out now, guys. - What did you call us? - I said come out now, guys. Ouch! Storm of despair. In these conditions I don't think it will be hard to take the decision to keep the swimming facility open. No... This will really cool everyone off. We need over 25? to get enough people in. There's no forecast above 25?. it's down to 10? - 20?. It's over. So you'll tell the president we're closing swimming as of next Sunday. I'm not taking that risk. It can change. It doesn't look likely. The forecasts go up to September 9th. Maybe it'll pick up as of the 15th. If you close for a week, reopening will be very difficult. - If you did it once. - It was a flop. Ah, it's flooded. That one. There we go. - Shall we cut there? - No. Well, well. Put that one back over there. Pull. What's that? It's a rabbit hole isn't it? Yeh, a rabbit hole. Well! It's big. It's not a fox that's made a hole like that. We'll fill it in, see if he comes back. We'll come and see. How strange. He lives under the beach! Unbelievable! - The season's over. - Yeh... The holidays are over. For everyone. I'm not done. Hold on. Here. It looks like red. - Can I borrow your red? - Yes. Can I try yours? Yes. Can you colour this in yellow? Don't go over the lines. I'm scared. There's water. I'll fall in. Cross. First, it's water then there's land. - I'm scared. - You're scared. Come here. - I'll fall. - You won't. It's solid, look. - The screwdrivers are solid. - Yes. So you won't fall. Go quicker if you're scared. Alright. The first time I crossed, I was scared. - Yes. - Now I'm used to it. There's a dog. No dog allowed. "No animals." "No music." "No knives." No knives, Michael. That too. It's not allowed. That's not allowed. Yes, that's not allowed. That's not allowed either. Look, swans. Look, white birds swimming. They take advantage when it's closed. - Sword! - Knife. My sword is all wet. - All wet. - On guard! - All wet. - Me too. On guard! - Me too. - Ting, ting, ting. - I killed you. - Shield! You can't touch me. I've got a shield. Ting! Ah, a track. - It'll sting me. - Nothing will sting you, Michael. - Do you want to hurry? - Yes. You won't win. Come on. Up we come! Wait for me. I won't leave you. Give me your hand. Hold this! Hold on tight. That looks like chocolate power. Come on! I've got you. Come on Michael. Come on. Let's see what's up there. Together. You know I won't leave you. We passed the test both of us! We both won. Wow. Last time we'll come here instead. To my brother Cl?ment To eternal childhood Subtitles by: pacoss
