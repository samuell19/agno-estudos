It's cold, what time is it? Just after 7 It's too early, come back to bed Let me finish my cigarette You should stop Go back to sleep, I'll be there in a minute What the hell are you doing? Sorry What time is it? Quarter to ten Well, it's about time How did you sleep? Not too good Why? Maybe you should smoke less Sure, that'll be it I already apologised for waking you up OK What were you thinking about so early? Nothing worth mentioning I guess it has to do with not sleeping well That's all I know you don't sleep well, maybe you should ask yourself why I slept better when I had something to wake up for Don't overthink it There are lots of things I shouldn't be doing it seems to me You're so gorgeous when you just wake up! What? You always wake up horny Don't be wicked It's true that you look handsome Get lost! I already said sorry I know Love me a bit, come on I already love you I can tell Where are you going? To the bathroom Do you wanna come too? I bumped into Carla in Lugo Square yesterday Really? What did that cow have to say? You are so mean! She said that they're looking for admin staff at Atlantic Insurance You should go and check it out Atlantic would be a good place to work I know it's not really your field But it would be easy for you You were one of the first people to have a computer here in Coruña You're so stuck in the past Everybody has a computer now And you're too hip How many people do you know that have one? I mean people in admin… I know our friends don't People in admin don't either You should go, you have nothing to lose You're right, maybe I will Did you see this about Germany? Are you drawing me? No Liar The way you're standing… makes your arse look…. If you loved me as much as you love my butt… Get lost Don't be mad I like that you like my ass Aren't you going to paint anymore? I was… Draw! No Why? I'm not in the mood anymore You are so pigheaded It's exhausting that you always have something to say I can't say anything nice about you Don't be like that, the day is just beginning Are you always up for it? Of course! I want you 24/7 If I had a penny for every kiss And what would you do with so much money? Where are you going now? For a shower I stink I like you sweaty Yes you do You back already? What did they say in Atlantic? Not a lot And that's it? 14 points! That puts Xose Ramón ahead of the competition The next question is for Rosa How many litres made an imperial gallon? 4.5 litres I'm reading! So stop for a moment and tell me They aren't looking for anyone That's weird, Carla told me… Carla can say what she wants Something happened and you don't want to tell me I'm telling you they aren't looking for anyone At least people like me What did they say? Nothing Same crap as always I don't fit in the job They are looking for someone younger, with a degree… That's bullshit You know more than anyone that's just graduated Ok So you go to tell them Don't blame me It doesn't matter, I didn't like the job anyway Well, you will have to find something you like You could go looking too They wouldn't choose me Probably not I told you to turn it off, I'm trying to read The living room TV is broken, and the sound is down Do I turn it on when you're reading? Listen What? "Doolie sick was an unnerving sight The envelope of personality was gone, dissolved by his junk-hungry cells Viscera and cells, galvanized into a loathsome insect-like activity, on the point of breaking through the surface His face was blurred, unrecognizable, at the same time shrunken and tumescent." That's sad I find it fascinating It talks about harsh things It isn't easy to find books like this As if the world we live in weren't grey enough Well the one you're reading isn't an “ode to joy” either Don't spoil it for me eh! I told my parents last night No! Why you did that? Thanks a lot for your support I didn't mean that but you know what your parents are like How did they take it? I thought that when it came down to it, it would be different So not well They want me to leave home What? How can they be such morons? Don't talk about my parents like that Are you really defending them? They are not perfect but they are the only ones I have Your father doesn't surprise me, but your mother… My mother has been married to my dad for 25 years I have never seen her go against him But this time is different You are their son! Aren't you? She didn't want any of this to happen She spent the whole night crying word That's all well and good But she didn't say anything 25 years is a long time being set in your ways Maybe if you talk with her alone I don't want them fighting over this, It's better to leave it as it is Where will I go now? What about your aunt's? My parents told her, she doesn't want to get involved So she's washing her hands of you? You're being mean I'm being mean? Your family is rejecting you for loving a man, and I am the one who's being mean? Let it go How can I? What are you going to do now? I don't know I'm sorry Come and live with me With your mom and grandma? Are you crazy? No dafty I have something to tell you too I got the job in the bank I told you about Now I can rent an apartment I guess I can crash at yours until I find a job No, you have to finish your studies first And who is going to pay my expenses? You? You don't get it do you? I don't want you to crash at mine a few days while you search for something else I want you to come and live with me The apartment can be ours In a few months you will be finished your studies and then you can find a job too And will we stop seeing other guys? What for? To be like straight people? What's the matter? We are not like them We can't make the same mistakes I don't want to be with anybody else Me neither But what if we do in the future? We can wait until they figure out what this new disease is And decide after that Ok? Well I guess it worth a try Since we are going to live together In the past 3 years we haven't spent more than a couple of nights together So? Are you sure about taking this step? Your family has taken it for us You don't owe me anything, I don't know if you know that What do you mean? You're always cleaning and tidying up like the maid So pick up your stuff I will, you don't have to do it Well I have to do something Since I don't work I don't work either You haven't been out of work long And it won't be long before you find something else You can't know that Well, let's see how we get by When did we turn into this? When did we turn into what? Into your parents You haven't mentioned them for a long time They popped into my head right now With Gabriel detergents your clothes… What were you thinking about, while you were reading? Do I have to tell you everything I think about? Maybe if you did, we wouldn't be so like them Breaking news, We are receiving from East Germany the images of a series of full-scale demonstrations… We have to do something Like what? Anything We need a change And what comes to mind? No idea Just ignore me Come on, talk to me It doesn't matter Since you are at home you turn everything around And you're driving me crazy Then we need to do something But something like what? Like what? I don't know ¡Gorby! ¡Gorby! Whatever you say Are you better? What was wrong with me?? Forget it Sorry I should not have mentioned your parents It doesn't matter It does Your father's passing is still recent I don't care You should, he was your father Yes, and you know how we treated us I know Is that what you were thinking about before? You can be so annoying when you want to be You think too much about the past lately How would you know what I think about? Because we've been together for 11 years Roberto It's lasting too long for you I see Don't start it again please! Do you have to go to bed so soon? I can't be bothered to do anything after that Let me cheer you up You always fix everything with sex It's not true We can go out On Monday? Nobody goes out on Mondays Come on, we can clear our heads We can dance a bit What we should do is talk We never do anything but talk You never want to talk Come on Cheer up Get dressed Let's go A bit of dancing A few drinks What do you say? But just for a while As long as you like One drink and back home Ok You're such a troublemaker And you love that Sure Come on, let's go I love you Me too Sorry about yesterday You always do the same You're right And don't say that just to shut me up I'm not You're absolutely right I'm an asshole You're right Do you want to talk? Now do you want to talk? You are always saying that we don't talk enough Yes, in fact we only talk about when you want to Well today I don't want to What's more, you always do the same, everytime You don't care about me, I don't know if you're with me out of routine, because you feel sorry for me… Don't say that I'm with you beacuase I love you I can't tell when you're lying to me or when you're telling the truth I don't lie to you, it's true So why do you do those things? I don't know Yesterday was a pretty weird day And when we hit the bar I drank too fast You drink like that because you don't tell me what's going on in your head We don't have to talk about eveything either You see! We only talk when you want to, and about what you want Don't be like that Only if it interests you I'm sorry Also If affects you this way I really think that we should talk about it Maybe you're right Can't you see? In the end I'm comforting you, I don't know how you do it That's because you're better than me And don't suck up now I'm not, it's true Leave me alone Diana was well pissed yesterday Do you remember when we feel off the bar? What's incredible it's that in your condition you can remember it too Doesn't matter which day we go out We always bump into her You would make a great couple Come on, don't be like that You know that if it wasn't for you, God alone knows where I would be Don't be daft I'm not, you know that Stop exaggerating You're the most important thing in my life Who would have thought it! I don't show it enough but I'm going to change I can't get angry with you What a pathetic kiss You don't deserve more than that Let me sleep a little more And if you make that noise again with the blind I'll kill you You're awake Did I sleep long? A couple of hours I love the shape of your back right here What else? And the beginning of your ass In this curve Sure, especially the beginning Idiot Do you like that too? That's what I like the most And you? What do you like about me? This thing right here isn't at all bad And seems a bit happy And what else? The shape of your collar bone, right here And anything else? The fact that you never left me Where I would want to go? There were times that anywhere would have been better than here And I caused most of those times I also like it when you lie to me to make me feel better I made you a promise That was a long time ago Nobody is going to force you to keep it But I want to keep it Do you remember the referendum day? What are you talking about? The constitutional referendum Why have you remembered that now? Because you were smoking in a similar way That's not true, that day I was practically chain smoking It's true, you were a nervous wreck Of course I was The two of us stranded in the middle of the Mount Pindo The 205 wouldn't start On the day that we could vote for the end of 40 years of hiding, prosecution, insults in the streets… You're so idealistic! It's been 11 years since then, and they still look badly at us if we hold hands in public And you still hear some insults too Yes, but things have improved a lot What has improved? Is your life better? Their lives are better! We are still shut away in dark pubs Deceiving the landlord and renting a two bedroom flat What the hell do we need another bedroom for? At least they can't put us in jail Your beloved referendum was already approved when I was jailed the last time No way! No? It was in January of 79 So late? I didn't remember that I remember! Your aunt's cousin, the military policeman He must have thought that locking me away for three days in that cell would cure me of my gayness And that you would find a good wife and have tonnes of kids It didn't go as he planned It certainly didn't But you have to admit that the constitution is the base of everything Base of what? The base of nothing We were persecuted several years after Franco's death And we have a head of state appointed by him I love it when you get on your soap box Like when you dragged me to the rallies Well, communism is not doing much better At least there, the women can have an abortion freely Because they don't have enough food to feed so many children Why do you think they are climbing the wall? I'm guessing that that wall will not stand for too long Promise to take me there when it falls? I don't know what with But if one day we do have some I promise I will How long we had been dating at the time of the referendum? 8 months wasn't it? That long? We started in March and the referendum was held in November or December I think We started in summer, in March was when we met And I count from then Since when? Since the very beginning We were inseparable from the first day How cares when we named it Do you remember that night? Loli introduced us Oh Loli… It was a pity Was she using heroine at that time? No idea, I don't think so At least she got us together She give us a good gift Even then, you were doing your tricks from the very beginning What do you mean? Our first date was perfect I'm going to get some napkins What's up Loli? Get me a drink What are you doing here so early! How welcoming! If you want me to leave… Don't be silly, it's just that I set your date with Miguel in an hour's time Yes, I know I want to see what the atmosphere is like first Why did you tell us to come so late? It's not that late! Quite normal if you ask me… If you say so By the way Who is performing today? … it's Miguel Miguel who? Your date What? What's wrong? Nothing, Now I know why you told us to come so late Listen I had better go, don't tell him I came Don't be silly! Don't be like that? Listen Loli, I don't like that thing What thing? Miguel is an amazing guy Look, come back in an hour and meet him I'm sure you will adore him I'm not promising anything Loli give me a drink please What's up with you? You did great! It was only your second show! Nothing's up Not much… At what time did do you say you set up the meeting with that guy? He must be about to arrive Sure Drink it He is not coming Don't freak out, it's only been 40 minutes Look! There he is is! Sorry! Am I a bit late At last! This is Miguel A bit late I'm sorry I lost track of the time I didn't think you would come A good friend of mine insisted that I should come and meet you She can be really insistent She is quite right too Sorry! Don't worry Do you want to dance? What are you thinking about? Nothing, nonsense That isn't new You reminded me of our first date It was quite a few years ago And what were you thinking? Nothing in particular We don't remember things in the same way What do you mean? It was not as perfect as you say, you were a bit late It was a weird day And that's it? Is that what gives you so much to think about? Yes and no Don't you want to tell me? Or did you arrive early, I don't remember now What are you talking about? Never mind Don't you want to tell me what you were thinking? I was just thinking, about time, about how it passes And how late for one person might be soon for another person You're worrying me Don't, it's nothing Don't tell me then Are you coming back to bed? Have you seen that David Bowie has released a new album? Really? I haven't heard about it The thing is that he has not released it as David Bowie With what name then? Ana Kiro? No, he has formed a group, Tin Machine That's strange It's a bit weird What? That someone so famous would hide his name in a group at this stage in his career Maybe was precisely that what he want, Escape from his name His last albums were pretty terrible A bit drastic don't you think? Who knows This may be a new beginning for him and he will make some wonderful albums the next decade You haven't even heard the last one yet It's not necessary We just have to trust Bowie If not, what's left? Fuck off What are you doing? Touching you You're going to start thinking I like you and all A bit more than the last few Bowie albums at least Thrice the brinded cat hath mew'd Harpier cries 'Tis time, 'tis time Thrice and once the hedge-pig whined What a rubbish adaptation I don't know why they insist on doing endless versions of Shakespeare They shouldn't mess with the dead We interrupt the broadcast of Macbeth to give way to a special news bulletin coming to us from East Germany where… I have had enough of newsletters about Germany Nothing is going to change anyway! You always think nothing is ever going to change What do you mean? That suddenly one day Things will change and catch you by surprise Where's this coming from all of a sudden? It's nothing No it's not About Germany, what else? Forget your problems with the new... Can you turn it off? I'm drawing The news is about to start I don't care Wasn't it you that was so interested in what's happening in Germany? We open with the lastest news in the Democratic Republic of Germany Where nine members of the government have notified of their resignation this afternoon If the wall comes down now We don't have the money to go there It won't come to that yet It seems like they're cleaning their reputation to stay in power Yes, it does look like that Pervert Do you want me to freeze death? You are very creative these days Why do you say that? You draw me Now you're taking photos of me Can I not like my boyfriend's body? Yes, my arse in particular, it would appear… Everything revolves around your arse So funny… And you? What's up with you today? What do you mean? You don't complain about me waking you up Or about me undressing you When have I ever had a problem with you undressing me? Don't you see how happy you are? I like the way you look at me when I am your muse And what is that “look “ like? As if you were going to eat me “At your service” I'm going to talk to Bernardo What did you say? That I'm going to talk to Bernardo! I'm thinking of organizing another exhibition Is the material you've been working on that good? I think so Go for it then But don't go over the top like the last time What do you mean? That we are penniless That's exactly why! With the exhibition we could make some money Sure, like the last time… Thanks for your vote of confidence I'm just saying that we can't afford to waste money If it was up to you, we wouldn't have done the other one either Rober... What? Nobody buys pictures of naked men Well, You know what? maybe I should change the model! Do what you want Well, I think I will! I'm home I got the bread… You back already? Yes Did you go and see “la Bernarda” in the end? Yes..I did And? Bah, What does he know… Not great then… That miser wanted me to pay all the expenses Tell me you didn't say yes We couldn't afford to, even if we wanted to I offered him 70% That's way too much! I know! It doesn't matter anyway, he didn't accept Apparently, it's not a good time, the market is slow Male nudes are hard to sell Same old story And what are you doing? Nothing That's no use I know, but I worry Our savings are running out We will figure out something Well, we have to do it before our dole money stops I know… And Is that all you were thinking about? Tell me It's everything, you know that… You worry too much I don't know I'm so scared of my own destiny There's no destiny as such Only the one we make It would be nice to believe that Then believe it I don't know if I can Of course, he is at work I know Sure, goodbye Goodbye mother Did you just say “goodbye mother”? Yes it was her What she want? Nothing, bother me about the funeral costs and God alone knows what, about the inheritance What a cheek! No, actually she didn't ask for anything I think she just wanted to talk Talk? Your mother? She must be feeling a bit lonely If she's calling you, she must be What? When was the last time she called you to “talk”? Did you know that she still refers to you as my “friend”? And you only talked about that? If you and I are just friends, do you think we'd be talking about anything else? That's true Maybe I should go and see her for a few days No, love A couple of nights maybe You know how it turned out the last time you went The situation was very different You don't say… I know I screwed up the last time, but you don't know how hard it was And I ended up hurting you when it wasn't your fault, but I think it's going to be different this time, besides my father is gone now Do as you will I wouldn't go When was the last time this worked? What? Don't you see that it's going to the same as always? But the last time… Don't even think about talking about the last time But… Just leave it! Ok? Tell me! Leave me alone! Don't treat me like an idiot, look at me when I'm talking to you! What?! Say it! You're right! I slept with him, okay? Okay? Moron! You make me feel sick! It's all your fault! My fault?! You don't know what they're like! They started with the same old story, that they didn't want to have a son like that and all that shit And you left me alone for two days with them And you wanted to piss them off right? It doesn't matter if you screwed me as well! Leave me alone! I told you to leave me alone! Listen to me Miguel… You have put up with a lot of my shit I told you I did not want to talk about that But it is clear that you never forgave me That's not true It was three years ago, if I hadn't forgiven you I wouldn't be here now But you're still hurting A bit, yes! That means that you haven't forgiven me entirely No That's because I can't forget it I couldn't even if I wanted to And I don't know if I really want to If it hurts, it's because I still love you You don't deserve what I did to you And you don't deserve the way I treat you… Is it possible to leave all of this behind us? It would be so easy if we could go back to the beginning It would be But time only moves forward I don't know Maybe... We should break up No No, we have always been together I wouldn't know what to do But we've been through so much But that should make us stronger! We have to find a way to make us stronger Not weaker And… Do you think we can? We've been through more difficult tests Yes, but we were younger I don't think I'm going to go… To see your mother? Yes It's for the best You're right It's going to do more harm than good I never understood your family I can understand that was difficult for them to accept you, but after all these years that nothing's changed I don't get it Not everyone is lucky enough to have a mother like yours I know Sometimes I think about how things would have been, if my father was alive But he was left wing, wasn't he? Yes He was left wing But he was born in 1938 At least it seems that the people are becoming more openminded from one generation to another A bit too slowly in my opinion Maybe by 2020 they won't look at us as if we were freaks anymore Yeah And families will accept their “queer” sons and drive around happily all together in their flying cars They will never accept us Don't be so pessimistic! Look to other countries Like Denmark They have just passed a new civil unions law Denmark isn't another country, it's on a different planet Light years from us Well, maybe we should go in those flying cars you were talking about And why didn't you go to vote? Bloody hell! It's been almost two weeks since the election! And? I didn't like either of them! I wasn't going to vote for Felipe again, that's for sure Well, you could have voted for the lesser of two evils...at least Sure You could have at least voted for the “Nationalist Block” like I said Come on, even Ruiz Mateos had more votes than them And he got hammered in the last ones With that attitude we will never get representation It's not a question of attitude, Galicia isn't nationalist, hardly anybody is here I bet you anything you like, that one of these days we will get into the Regional government Sure, keep on dreaming Do me a favour, turn on the TV I'm sure that the news is already on And on to other things, the new leader of the GDR, Egon Krenz, convened a meeting of the central committee To work on a decree law on the opening of the country's borders You could see this coming, they are capable of emptying the country just as long as they don't have to leave They will never go Forget about our holidays The Wall is going to be there for some time Where have you been? I went out for a while to run some errands Why didn't you tell me? It's no big deal Yes, it is! What's in that envelope? Just some paperwork Where did you go? To see the doctor? What's up? The only things I have to manage are about doctors? Is that all I'm good for? Don't be a drama queen! You know that you can't just take off like that Take off? If I only went out for a moment! You know you can't, regardless Who's making me? You? Am I locked in? What are you doing? Where do you think I have been? If you don't want to tell me, how the hell should I know? You're paranoid! What I am, is worried! What did the doctor say to you? Here we go again! I haven't been to the doctor's! Is that all that I am to you? A sick person you won't leave because you pity me? Let me tell you that you are not my nurse or my guard! Jesus! Sometimes it's like you want me to leave… And that's what you're going to get Maybe you should, it's not going to be a pretty spectacle I've already heard that before What did the doctor say to you? Leave me alone! I don't love you! Screw you Miguel! I should have left you to rot alone! Forgive me What's wrong? I'm scum, I don't deserve you You're scaring me, what do the blood tests say? It's not just the blood test What do you mean? I should have told you You can tell me now I'm positive What!? I'm so sorry Roberto, I'm an asshole And now you have to be tested too But how did this happen? I don't deserve you Who with? I'm a piece of shit Tell me who it was!? And now I put you in danger Shit. ..shit ..shit ..shit!! You can't go through life like this! How could you do this to me again? Again?! Who do you think you are? Calm down a bit.. ok? How can I calm down? I put us both in danger And now you are going to leave me And I deserve it I didn't say I was going anywhere You will I'm not denying how angry I am right now But we have been through so many things together and we will get through this too it's not going to be a pretty spectacle Hey… don't give up yet We will fight this Why won't you go? Why won't you go? Sorry Where would I want to go? Miguel, I can't stand it anymore Don't say that It's all just too difficult We can get through this I asked for your support yesterday and I'm asking you again now I know… but I can't You're asking too much of me, and whatever I do... Just never seems enough Before, we managed to make things work Before it was different Is it my fault, for being sick? Don't say that! So? You've changed Miguel That disease changed you and I've changed too I've done all that I could I don't want to give up And you mustn't! I'm going to stay by your side But not like this You don't love me anymore I will always love you But 11 years is too long Especially the last one Especially the last ones The boy I fell in love of is too far away You haven't changed You now that's not true I should go and stay at my cousin's house Not tonight, no If I don't go now, I don't think I will ever be able to do it I'm going to stay by your side But not like this Promise me I don't have to promise anything I already did that a long time ago Are you sure you don't want to spend the night? I can't Don't forget to take your meds Do you hear me? My body is fighting for time that doesn't belong to it… Do you remember when were younger and we played at holding our breath under water? My life has become “let's see how long you can keep breathing above water…” I can't Please Please Stop You're right, sorry I'm going to turn on the TV I don't want to see you go These are the shocking images what are we receiving at this very moment From East Berlín where after the press conference this afternoon Roberto Don't insist, don't make it more difficult No, on the TV And now… yes? We are receiving right now the images that we are watching on the screen Dozens of people climbing the wall Are you seeing the same as I am? This seems to be the end of East Germany It seems that the Berlin wall has just fallen
