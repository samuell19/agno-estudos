I am okay. It's me. Mikey. Remember me? I know. What are you doing here for? I just came to see Lexi and I came to see you, of course. Both of you guys, but is Lexi here right now? Lexi! Thank you. You won't believe who's here. Oh my gosh. Oh my, shit. Surprise. Oh my God. What the-- What are you doing here? Oh, it's good to see you too. Why are you here? -Where do I begin? Let me-- -No, you are not coming in this house. -All beat up. -That's right. -What the fuck-- -All right. All right. Well-- -I'll tell you what's-- -Why are you here? -Yeah. -Oh, well-- Why are you here? Ma, can you give me a-- Lil, I just wanted to come in and hang for a couple of days. No, you are not coming in here. Mom, can you-- can you just go inside? What the fuck, Mikey? I know, I know this is unexpected. Oh, nothing with you is unexpected. I still got that sass. Look, I don't know what you want but I can't help you. So it doesn't matter how or why you're here. Go away! Hey, Lil. Ma. Goddammit! I don't wanna be here. All right? This is embarrassing. -I don't want you here either. -You think I wanna show up like this? I got my ass fucking kicked. I just need a place to crash. -Why can't you hear, just let me-- -What does it look like? A hotel? Really? It's like that? Can you get off the property please? -What are you gonna fucking do? Really? -You want me to call the cops? -I'll call the cops. -No. Don't-- I'm calling the cops. Ten, nine, eight, seven. Faster. I'm technically off the property. So you can't call the cops cause I'm on public land. -Respecting your boundaries. -Can you keep it down? Can you come over here, so I don't have to project my voice, please? Fuck. Seriously. I just need a place to crash for a couple of days. What's the big deal? Mikey, go fuck yourself. Oh. You don't even know what I've been through. Look at my fucking face. I just was on the bus for two days. I had to walk here from the bus station-- Why don't you stay with your mama? My mom's in a nursing home in Lubbock. A care home. I can't sleep there. Mikey. What do you want? -My God. -What do you want? I just fucking told you. I just need to crash for a couple of days. -What? You want money, right? Here. -No, I don't-- fucking money. I got 22 fucking dollars. Here. Come and get it. I can't come on your property. Come get your money. You should have called. If I would have called you would have said no. I'm still saying no. So you fucked yourself back in it. -Oh, please, come on, you know me. -Damn straight, I do. You know me and you know I wouldn't be literally begging if I had somewhere to go. And if you don't let me in, I'm gonna sleep in Tarpey fucking park tonight. Is that what you want? You said you're never gonna step a foot in Texas again. And then the world fucked me. What can I say? -Peek-a-boo. -Ma. See your mom's saying, let him in, let him in and take a shower. And the dog's like, oh, he's a good man. I can tell by his nice energy. Please let me take a fucking shower. This shit got out of fucking control. If I didn't see it with my own eyes, I wouldn't believe it. The place turned into a fucking trap house right under my nose. Fucking Spiegler sends me some scraggly bitch from Ohio that he promised would be chill. Her first night in the house, she gets in a fight, knocks this fucking bitch out. Crack, right in front of me. It was like, holy shit. So anyway, she bounced, now I got to fill the room so I don't lose the month. And her friend comes and stays there and just gets high the whole fucking time. Why didn't you just kick the bitch out? I had seven hoes in there letting MS-13 deal drugs the whole time. Lil, MS-13 is a gang you don't want to fuck with. You're good. Okay. Do you need any coffee? All right, sorry. So anyway, long story short, I ended up hiding out in my room because these dudes were straight fucking killers and I didn't wanna fucking get killed, so I played video games the whole time. -Remember the house in Chatsworth? -Uh-huh. Well, th-- this place was like maybe five times bigger, beautiful house. I had a two year lease with an option to buy it at the end of the lease. Right? Well, as usual shit got fucking crazy. I snapped. I got up in one of those cholos spaces. Cause I'm not a little bitch. I came this fucking close to getting shot, this fucking close. So then I had to crash with Kennedy. Do you remember Kennedy? Remember? Do you remember Kennedy? Anyway, I had to crash at Kennedy's for like three weeks until he kicked my ass out cause someone left his back door open and his cute little cat got out and got killed and it wasn't me. It was some dumb cunt that he fucked the night before. I'm sorry. I don't mean to swear, but I don't do that. Like everyone blame me like, oh Mikey, he's the bad guy. It's like, whatever. It's bullshit. So anyway, I had to crash at his place. He kicks me out. For like three nights I slept on a fucking street. I slept in an alleyway. I used my shoes as a goddamn pillow. It's fucking bullshit. My neck was so sore. I got beat up. That's how this, all this happened, two homeless fuckers beat the shit out of me. They took everything except my phone and my wallet. And the only reason they didn't get that as the cops showed up and arrested my ass. Why'd you get arrested? I have a feeling there's a whole lot more to this story. Yeah. I'm sure there is. W-- what? It doesn't even matter. Look, guys, this could be fun. This could be cool. I got a plan. While I was on the bus I thought about this. I gave it some serious thought. Lil, you know, I'm not a free loader, right? -While I'm here-- -How long? -How long, what? -How long do you plan on staying? Well, I mean, that's up to you and Lexi, of course, but look, I saw some hiring signs on the way in. I'll go downtown tomorrow and I'll get a job that pays cash. I'll teach fucking karate if I have to. I just got my green belt, okay? And I'll make cash, and I'll help out around here. You need a man around the house. Can't you already see shit's falling apart? I can help out with all that shit, right? I want at least 200 a week. Thank you Lil. You're not going to regret this. Seriously. Thank you so much for trusting me. I'm gonna-- Let's give it a couple of days and see how it goes. Yeah. Whatever you're comfortable with. I don't want to make you uncomfortable. I'm here to help and look, before long, it'll be like, we're still married. We are still married. Oh my God. The backyard is a mess, see? You need a guy around you. Dude, there's a dragon fly. Find out when, when she called you now you traveled. -Yeah. I was in Florida. -How many days later? This was about three days. So she called you and said they were in a high speed-- She say I was in a high speed chase with Dante. -Morning. -Who was chasing? -She was chasing him. -Morning. He was in the car. She pulled up. -Somebody told her where they were. -I love this show. I watch it every day so get used to it. And from what I was told, they were doing like a 80 down the main street. She's trying to catch him. And he hit a pole, a fence pole. What do you say happened? I was coming back from the airport, dropping her off as she stated. And when I was at the stop sign I had the right way to go, now, this car just came straight through the stop sign. They ran a stop sign and T-boned the car almost like -they hit the front of the car. -Was this your baby mother in another car? -No. -When she calls you and she tells you, because I believe that conversation happened. Do you call him? -Yes. -And what does he say? He like, man, you know that crazy girl. It's not my fault. She crazy. I was trying to, he was in fear for his safety is what he told me. -Is that what you said? -No. I don't believe you. Sir, you have a $500 counterclaim for emotional distress. I cannot wait to hear this. Hey, Lil, I'm going to borrow some of your ground beef, okay? Okay. Hey, Lexi. -Hello? -Yeah. I'm not looking too presentable so I'm gonna let this thing go down before I go on this interview. So few more days. Okay? All right? Sure. All right. Thank you. It was before she started getting to my bed. -Really? -Yes. So that's what your counterclaim is about. She has caused you emotional distress. Not baby mama number one, two, three or four but her. -All of them do. -Okay. They all run together. Your-- your counter claim is dismissed, sir. Judgment in this case paying $2902. Not even one man shirt? Beggars can't be choosers, Mikey. Your last job listed is over 17 years ago. That's quite a gap in employment. You know, I've, I've worked almost every day for the last 17 years. It's just, I've been self-employed. -What line of work? -Oh, mostly entertainment. I've been living in Los Angeles. That's why I have the 323 area code right there in case you were wondering, but yeah, film, television, music, entrepreneurship. Okay. So why are you interested in working here? -Well, I'm living here now. -Okay. We were estranged for a while. I'll be honest, but you know, we're both from here and you know, now that we're back living here, we decided to, to make a run of it. Well, we do require some experience or previous training in the service industry and at least one reference. Yeah, that's going to be tricky. But I did work for Cicis pizza in '99 to 2000. I think that branch that I worked for closed, I put it on there, but yeah, you could contact corporate if you like. Look, if you, if you were incarcerated, that's okay. I just need something from your parole officer. -Look, I'm gonna to be straight with you. -All right. I need that. Okay. All right. Look, I'll just be honest with you. You don't recognize me, do you? I'm an adult film actor. Excuse me. A porn star. Um, I'm a porn star. I know, I've been working in the adult entertainment industry since 2001. -And you know, even though-- -Did you say porn? Hey. No, that was fun. -I'm sure was. -Yeah. All the la-- Why don't you just Google me? Look up Mikey Saber. Mikey-- Saber, S-A-B-E-R-XXX. Go ahead. Search it. Unbelievable. Yeah, that's what they say. Yeah, just pull down. Yep. That's me right there. Younger me, but-- -Oh, that certainly is you. -Yeah. 2000 movies, six awards, 13 nominations in hall of fame did that. Now I want to start fresh and really start a new chapter, a new life with, with you and your company, ma'am. I'd really like to help you, but, um, my management,they would not permit this. I'm sorry, but you are just simply overqualified for this job. I'm just not sure our customers would be comfortable with you waiting on them. They may have seen one of your movies. But later on when you get home, Google Mikey Saber XXX. And you'll see what I'm talking about. There's some good shit. Okay. Yeah, I'll do that. -Thanks. -Thanks man. Take care now. Nobody's hiring.

But I'm thinking, I don't know maybe I'll just go with the chocolate and got to get some milk with-- Oh, you guys go ahead. I'm gonna need a minute. -Thank you, buddy. -Hi. What can I grab you? I would like a large coffee, please. Uh, one Hazel Cream and two chocolate donuts. Help yourself to the cream. And what can I get for you, sir? I'll get a coffee, black. Filled doughnut, and that'll be it. Sweet. Can I share the same bag? Yes. Yes. Good to conserve. Your coffee is coming right after-- -Good morning. -What's the damage? Uh, $6.32. -There you go. -A $10. Hey, miss Phan, can I get some help out here? -There's your tip. -Thank you. Next customer please. Hey, when do things slow down around here? -Oh, excuse me. -What time does it wind down? We are slammed until like two-ish. I'll see you at two. Okay. I'm sorry about that. Uh, what would you like? I'm back. Just like I promised. I'm a man of my word. So in the future, you can always rely on me. Back to tell more doughnut jokes. No, that was actually the only doughnut joke I had and it took me a very long time to write that one. That's all I got. -Why? Do you have any? -Actually I do. Um, what do you call a Jamaican doughnut? Hmm. I like where this is going. Give me a minute. Uh, Jamaican Doughnut. I'm stumped. Cinna-mon. I got to go. That was really, that hurt my feelings. That was terrible. That's okay. I forgive you. So Raylee I'm thinking-- Call me Strawberry. Call you what? -Strawberry. -Strawberry? -Everybody calls me that. -You're kidding. Okay. How old are you? -Who is asking? -Me. -Why? -Come on. I'm old enough. For what? Oh God, I'll be 18 in three weeks. Okay? I know what you're too old for me. Anyway, Strawberry. Can't believe that's your name. I don't know which doughnut to get. I need your help. I really liked the look of those doughnut holes and those, you know, do you frost to do the sprinkles? Do you do those? Who makes them? I do the sprinkles and I fill the cream. -You fill the cream? -Yeah. I just want the ones that you make. I want the ones that you cream filled. Does that sound-- I don't wanna get you in trouble. I'm thinking maybe a chocolate round or maybe I'll get a strawberry filled. No pun intended. Actually I do. I don't think she likes me very much. I don't think she likes anyone very much. Yeah. She's a mean boss. Anyway, okay. So yes, I've decided. Chocolate round. Okay. But you want chocolate sprinkles, chocolate cake, chocolate Bavarian cream? There's all those different chocolates? Oh no. Now I got to stay here for a few more hours and decide. Son of a bitch. Are you trying to keep me here? Cause I'll sit in the corner and contemplate this for a while until you get off. What time do you get off? It feels so fucking good. Oh shit. Fucking, bitch. Yeah. Do you like that? You like that big dick inside of you. Not bad. Huh? Not bad at all. I didn't even have to take one of my magic pills. I didn't know you're using. Yeah. You remember how hard it is to keep it right on set all day. Yeah. Remember when Christina Roseanne was broken? I do. I do. I surprised it even works at all. I wish it was. Oh yeah. Love the exterior decorating, sir. It's looking spiffy. All right, dad, we'll be back around five. Do you think he remembered me? Man, ever since my mom died, all he cares about is keeping his place immaculate. Matter of fact, I've been screwed out of male performer of the year, literally five times, but you know what? I don't say shit. It's all good. I'm a team player. Almost every single girl I did a scene with started fucking me off camera. Right? But the agents hate that shit. What do they expect? You know, it's like, girl comes by my model house. They see my hall of fame trophy on the medal piece. They're like, oh my God, he's famous for fucking. Wait, you said your model house? I had three model houses, bro. And the last one, Ooh, that was a Savage ass house until I started letting agents book bottom bitches in there. Bottom bitches? Bottom bitches are technically the best of the hookers. But they're still the hookers. And that's what they started saying to me, it was the fucking hookers. And that's when everything went to shit, cause see, once a porn chick gets a hooker mentality they become a fucking nightmare, a real pain in my ass. -Oh yeah? -Yeah. Dude, I forgot how hot Gulf Coast bitches are. I saw this girl over by the doughnut shop at the Refinery. She works there, smoking hot, gorgeous drop dead gorgeous and get this, 17 years old. Legal as an eagle. -Oh yeah? -Yeah. Hey man. See that strip of land over there. Yeah. That was the Texas killing fields, brother. -Strawberry. -Yeah? -You blaze, right? -Why? You a cop? Let's go smoke one. Hey Miss Phan, can I take my Ten. So what'd you do in LA? I've been in entertainment. I knew it. You have that Hollywood vibe. -Yeah. You dig? -Yeah. So what'd you do in entertainment? Manager slash agent. -Like for actors? -Yeah. That weed is good. Right? Do you or your friends want any? I could get a whole bunch more. No problem. So you live in Hollywood managing actors. But you're in Texas City riding a bike, selling weed and hitting on high-schoolers? Well, my Camaro's in LA, you know, I wasn't going to drive all the way to Texas. It's like a three-day drive. All right. Look, I'm here taking care of my mom, all right? She's not doing too well. I'm sorry. It's all right. You're a good son for being there for your mom. I am. By the way, who smokes joints anymore? That's so old man-- That was fun. We should do that again sometime. Yeah. I'll smoke your weed anytime. Hey, by the way, you can move all your shit on the hard hats from the refinery. I see them at the end of their shift and they want to kill themselves. See you later, alligator. In a while, crocodile. -Oh shit. -Oh my gosh. I'm sorry. Sorry, Lil. Oh, man. I'm sorry. I thought you found my couch comfy. Oh, I do. I just-- I sleep out natural. Cut the shit. My bad. Mikey, all seriousness. I appreciate you taking care of bills. That way it keeps Lexi from being on the Craigslist. Do you understand what I'm saying? I under-- yeah. So I need to know, are you in or out? If you're in, I welcome you here. All right. Hey-- If you're out, don't let the door hit you in the ass. -I'm in. I'm in. -Okay, fine. I'm paying the fucking rent. So tell me please, this is about my baby. I don't want her getting hurt anymore. I don't want her doing clients anymore. It's too dangerous. I never know when she's coming home. So it's up to you. I'm in, okay? I'm in. -Okay, good. -I'm here. -Alright? -Good. -Thank you. -You're welcome. Anything else? Am I good to go? Yes. As long as I don't see your junk anymore. Deal. Your mom's still a trip. I know. In a good way. She is a piece of work. That smoke, that second one from the left. Is that new? Has that always been there? That's always been there. Lil calls that one old smoky. It's my ex's truck. Get up two years ago. Still handsome. Just needs new wheels. Well, I know you guys get tested, which is why I've got this synthetic piss. I'll throw it in free with an ounce, other than that at 10 bucks a pop. I got you if you guys ever need it. You know, I don't want you guys getting fired and shit. Don't drink it. I mean, unless you're into that kind of shit. -Goodnight, Miss Phan. -Goodnight. Goodnight. See you later, Alligator. Do you want a ride home? No, I'm good. Throw it in the back. Uh, yeah? Yeah, throw it in the back. Okay. -Which way? -Go left here. We're getting close. I really appreciate you driving me home. It's a nice area, huh? Just wanted to buy my mom something nice to retire. That's real sweet of you. All right. Yeah. It's right up here. Yep. Right there. There it is. Maybe would-- can you turn it down? Cause you know, I don't want to wake up my mom. -Well, this is fancy. -Yeah, it's nice. I'd invite you in, but like I said, you know, my mom's feeling sick and she don't take too kindly to strangers. She's just not all there up there right now. No. Yeah, probably not a good idea anyway. Yeah, so thanks for the ride. Anytime, I work on Wednesday. Oh, well, I'll see you Wednesday. -Okay. -Okay. Look, I'm just glad weed is still illegal in Texas. You guys have no idea how hard it is to move flower in Cali right now. I mean, yeah. You know, I'm selling it to the bitches at my model house but besides that felons and illegals. Don't mess with big oil. TCPD kids, they sent him Valero, gosh. It goes without saying, but you know, keeping it on the deo has been secret to my success all these years. How do you think I stayed out of prison? How do you think I've never got shot? Mom, where is the hot sauce? Where the hell it always been. No hot sauce, mom. I don't see it. Did you look in your bedroom? You were eating pizza-- Oh my God, mom, I don't-- Where's the hot sauce? Why would he take it in his room? You laughing, but you were eating pizza there. Mom, I've checked everywhere in the kitchen. Where's the hot sauce? Hey man. What are you looking at? This ain't got nothing to do with you. The world would collapse without me. Did you check under your bed? Hey, yo-- So heard you do porn or something? Five AVNs. What-- that's an STD? No, no, no. It's the, uh, it's the adult film awards. It's like the academy awards for what I do. -Oh, okay, man. That's what's up? -Yeah. Best oral three years in a row. -Best oral? -Yep. Just one question-- Ain't that about getting head? I mean, you know, something like that. So then what that gotta do with you? It's not like you're the one doing any work or anything. I'm not doing the work? Sister, let me tell you something. Hey man, don't call me sister. Oh, my bad, June, right? It's June? Alright, June. Look, if I won three years in a row with three different girls, the chances it of being the girl, pretty limited. Think about it. No, seriously, look, I'm the one guiding the girl in the scene. Essentially, I'm face fucking here. Pardon my language. So, you know, the female really has nothing to do with it. You know, I'm the one that's holding her head for like 15 or 20 minutes while I'm force fucking her. So how is that about her exactly? -I got it, man. -No, seriously look. It's about the shit I say. The way I hold their face towards the camera while she spits and drools all over herself and I pinched her nose and make her gag. -It's all techniques. -I said, I got it. Thank you. Thanks, dude. Man, this place is off the chain. Thank you so much for hooking this up. My pleasure. So tell me more about LA. Maybe you should find out for yourself. You think I have the money to go? You got a truck. -You could go anytime you want. -That's my momma's truck. She just lets me use it. Cause she works from home. Well, when I left Texas city I didn't have a dime. I just said to myself, Mikey, one day, you're going to own this town. I just went for it. You know? What is he doing behind the counter? He's gonna help me with my SAT prep. No free donuts. Thank you. So you were saying something about just going for it. Are you trying to get fired? I'm trying to get hired. Are you going to help me score high on the SATs? Yeah. You get 600 points just for signing your name, you know? -Oh yeah? -Yeah. -Hi, what can I get for you today? -Hey, sweetie, can I get a two-- two chocolate covered doughnuts and a medium coffee? All right. Good afternoon, sir. You're crazy. You know that? You could have just waited till now, you know? Where is the fun in that? Come here. Yo, Lonnie. Wait up. What's up, man? What up, Big dog? Where are you going? Man, some errands. I got to go to the mall, stuff like that. Cool. I'm rolling with you. Just warning, man. I'm gonna be gone all day. Just, so-- If you don't wanna go, I mean-- Whatever. I just gotta get the fuck out of here. Let's go. She's smoking hot. She made the first move. She's got no dad and here's the kicker. She lets me sell weed to the hardhats at her work. I mean does it get any better than this? I didn't know you served. Uh, oh yeah. Yeah, I did, man. Thank you for your service. Yeah, man. No problem, Man, this place ain't changed much in 15 years, Lonnie. Yeah, I know for real, man. Hey, um-- I think I'm gonna be hanging out over here for a while. Okay? Okay. Yeah. I'll meet you back here in 30. All right? -30 minutes? -Yeah. All right. Sounds good. Oh, come on, it's-- So what's this one then? Uh, that's the one I got when I was in Afghanistan and uh, that's from my three tours in Iraq. Bullshit. You're not even wearing the proper infantry uniform. Well, yeah, of course I am. What's the army uniform regulation, the code? Uh, to do my best, to do my duty and to serve my country? You sure it's not AR 670-1. Uh, you guys know-- there's a lot of different codes in the military. Stolen valor right here, folks. This man is not a veteran. He's a fake and a fraud. Give me those back. Those are mine. We'll take your jacket off. This is bullshit. What do I have to do to convince y'all-- Take it off or I'm gonna fucking kick your ass. Hey, man. Whiskey, Tango, Foxtrot. Wait, what? Really? I would think someone in your position would know what that means. Oh shit. Yeah, man, I-- I kind of have like a full bathroom mishap in there. Oh, man, little bathroom mishap. Oh, you sure you didn't get pushed in the fountain? Shit. -You fucking saw that, man? -Dude, I saw the whole fucking thing, bro. You think I'm stupid? I can't be associated with that shit, bro. That's fucked up that you would let me be a part of your fucking bullshit scheme, dude. I'm fucking pissed. Dude, what if someone recognized me? People know who the fuck I am, Dog. That's whack.

I just wanna talk to him. You promise? This is crazy. Now what? Is this the house? Oh my God. Wow. That's his mom? Hello, ma'am. Would you be so kind as to send Nash out, please? Hi, Mrs. Parker. Nice necklace, fucking dork. What is this? What's going on? Hey buddy. I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but you ain't with Strawberry. You never were. She's with me now. You understand? Raylee, what is this? I've been tryna tell you, Nash. All right. Look, bro, so you're not gonna call her, not gonna text her. You're not going to go by the Donut Hole anymore. You understand me? Raylee, come on, I need to talk to you. Whoa, whoa-- Hold on. Hold on. Whoa, hey, no fighting. Okay? Just stay in the car, babe. All right. Come here. Google me. Take out your phone right now and Google Mikey Saber. Do it. You got your phone on you? What the fuck are you talking about? -No fighting. -Babe. It's okay. 20.1 million views on PornHub, bro. I'm not fucking with you. Strawberry's in a different league now. Do you understand me? You can't compete with someone that fucked 1300 bitches. Do you get what I'm saying? Hey, let's not cause a scene. What are you doing? Who is this? -Come on. -I'm with him now. You heard it from her mouth. She's with me. Are you serious? -Come on. -I'm sorry, dude. -It was fun though. -It wasn't fun. Oh my God. I'll see you tomorrow. Yeah. You will. Life's sweet, Sophie, life is sweet. X equals negative B plus minus the square root of B squared minus four C all over to A. What-- that's geometry? Algebra. Shit. All right. Relax. No. That's Nash. That's Nash? Shit. I think this time I had a man to man with this kid. No fighting. You know what, I'm tired of your fucking shit, bro. I'm not afraid to fight you. I don't give a fuck. What? This is your mommy and daddy. You brought them to the dance. You can't handle your shit by yourself, huh, tough guy? Sir, your son is fucking with my girlfriend. It ain't cool any-- No. Stop. Fuck. Nash, what the fuck? I'm not with you anymore. -Fuck you. You cheated on me. -No, I didn't. We were never together. No. You go in my home, threatening my son motherfucker? Really took three of you to fuck me up. You're a pussy. What are you talking about? What do you mean you're not with him anymore? From the start I fucking said I never wanted to be with you. It was like a casual fucking thing. Fuck that shit you wanted me. -You're a little slut. -No-- You're a fucking slut. Hey, don't call my momma that. -What the fuck? -You ain't got nothing to say? You come near my house again, you'll be leaving in a body bag, bitch. Sorry. I'm sorry. He should go to the hospital. Yeah, maybe you should go to the hospital. No. It's not that bad. And plus I don't have health insurance anyway but thank you, Miss Phan. -Okay. Now, stop moving. -Alright. -There's no fighting in my parking lot. -He flat out sucker punched me. I would have hundred percent out cardio that guy. Fuck. Sorry for swearing. Oh shit. Be careful. That's where he kicked me. That's where he kicked me. That fucking little bitch. Shit. Am I bleeding on my head? Fuck. We both gonna be hurting tomorrow. Why is that? Let's just say you're blessed. Yeah. I can't believe I'm attracted to a ginger. You're not allowed to use the G word. You have a type? Maybe. What's your type? Let's just say, I like men, not boys. Oh, I'm sorry. I think I have the wrong house. Yeah. Cause I saw you parked in front of my house last night, too. No, it's as simple mistake. I'm new in town. If I see you around here again-- No, no, no. It's okay. It's okay. Honestly, if shit was different, I could take over the industry with her. You think so? Yeah, within six months I could see her nabbing best newcomer. One year and she would sweep the AVNs. Tori Black-- you know who Tori Black is? Yeah, man, of course, I know Tori Black is. Uh, she won performer of the year, two years back to back. Right? I think that Strawberry's got the potential. I'm not exaggerating. I really believe this. I think-- I think she could win three years in a row with my guidance, of course. Doesn't matter. I'm stuck in this shit hole anyway. Yeah, man, it's gonna be kinda awkward, anyway. She's gonna have to bang all those other fucking guys on scene. I don't give a fuck. I'll be fucking other bitches, bro. Come on. I think it's hot. I don't care. Okay, man. Seriously, it's part of the game. That was nice. You wanna explain those bruises? I fell off my bike. Must have been a hard fall. This is eight, I need 10. I'm moving a lot of weight for you guys. Huh? I like those gold teeth. I got one dia-- I got one diamond I had my dentist in Cali put in. So-- You need to get your ass outta here, man. All right. Say hi to your mom for me. These refinery boys are the best. They buy way more weed than these skaters and dancers I gotta deal with. -Dancers? -Yeah, from the titty bar. Strippers. They prefer the term dancers. Young lady, show some respect. Okay. Topless dancers. Oh, bottomless too, when they got it off. Really? Yeah. You've never been? Why would I've been? Plus, I'm not even old enough to get in. You wanna go? Seriously? Hello. -How old is she? -18. 20 bucks. You are hotter than all of these girls combined. If you worked here, they'd be outta their job. You give a tip? Give it to them. It's fine. Go. Right here. Right here. -Here? -Yeah. Go in there. Just gotta get some milk. Well, Goodnight. I can-- I can wait and drive you all the way home. Oh no, it's okay. I like to ride my bike at night. Okay. But technically that was our first date. So you just brought me to a strip joint for our first date. -Real classy. -Ooh, snap. Well, I guess we got to do it again. You wanna go to the pier Friday night? Pete's liver and onions at Louie's. I love Louie's. Daddy wanna play? I don't know if I'm feeling it. I can feel it. -Just not-- -Nice and fast. I don't think it's happening today. Don't you wanna get in me? Yeah. Don't you wanna get in this pussy? I don't feel it. I'm sorry, I'm just not feeling it. Jesus Christ. Okay. Okay. What? It's fine. Whatever, I didn't want to anyway. Lonnie. Lonnie. Lonnie. Don't be tied up all day. -Hey, Lonnie-kanes. -Hey, Lexi. What's up? Not much. What are you doing? Ah, you know, working around with the old man. Nice. Same shit different day. I know. I know. What are you doing? I'm just-- you know, getting some air. Some sunshine. So you and Mike have been hanging out, huh? Yeah. It's been fun having him in town. -Oh, really? -Yeah. Is he giving you money for all those rides you giving him? No. I mean, I don't mind we're buds. I know y'all don't got one set of wheels right now. So-- No, we don't. Not right now. -You've been working out? -No. -You look good. -Thanks. You're sure you haven't been working out? I'm positive. Can't call you scrawny Lonnie no more. Can they? -You keep Mikey out of trouble, you hear? -I'll try. I know you will. -It was good seeing you. -Good seeing you. Take care. There's a lot of rides. We could do the roller coaster. I'm not tall enough. I think it's like 48 inches or whatever. I'll give you a 48 inches all day long. I'm sorry, that was too easy. But I got you, it's like, if you get scared, just grab on something. I'll hold your hand. So after this, are you gonna fuck me on to the boardwalk? You sexy little exhibitionist, you know that? Look who is talking. Wait. What do you mean? You know what I mean. Mr. Saber. Oh my God. The second I broke up with Nash my Facebook blew up with everyone and their fucking grandmas sending me links to your videos. And you're cool with it? Would I be here if I gave a shit? I actually think it's kind of dope. I think it's cool. You just said: Fuck it. I'm going to get paid for doing the thing I love most. And as long as you're not hurting anybody, you do you, man. But if you give me something, I swear to fucking God. Thus porn folks are most tested people on the whole planet. I mean, think about it. We gotta get tested to work, you know. -Maybe I gave you something. -Oh, don't even kid. I posted a nude online once. I can never tell if you're joking or if you're serious. My friends and I were messing around and that subreddit gone wild. We were just trying to see how much attention we could gain and we weren't even naked. We had like our stuffed animals like that, you know? But this old guy in Ohio propositioned us to sell the nude pic. And I did. And he Venmo-ed me 60 bucks. 60 bucks? You're a bad, bad girl. The 60 bucks ain't shit. You should get at least double that. Were you planning on never telling me? Yeah. It's not something you drop on a civilian. A civilian. Is that what I am? Yeah, you don't have to be. For real? Look. I'm gonna be straight with you. I've been in the business almost 20 years and nobody, nobody comes close to you. Straight up, you could be a huge star, I'm just saying. You are funny. Look, I'm already about to have a very awkward senior year. I'm not about to have a very awkward rest of my life. Hey. Hey Mikey, how are you doing? I'm good. What are you doing here? Just catching up with Lil and Lexi. Catching up on some old stuff. Shooting the breeze. Sounds like it. Let me know next time. I'll make some steaks. Hang out with you guys. -Sounds great. -Yeah. Sound like a plan. Ladies, I'mma get up outta here. It's getting late, but your hospitality was good. The conversation was boss. -See you. -Absolutely. See you again, Lily. -My baby. -Please come back. I will. I will. -Take care of yourself, baby girl. -You too. All right. Mikey, I'm sure, I'll see you soon. Yep. You will. Good night. God bless you. Did it come through? Yeah. Bullshit. You see her? She's fucking smoking, right? You're not going to believe this dude. Her name is Strawberry. -What? -Fucking strawberry. You can't make this shit up, man. Yeah. Has there even been a strawberry before? Oh, she's my way back in, man. I'm telling you, this is like a Jenna Jamieson, Sasha Grey level find here. Fuck. I'm blessed. I'm so fucking blessed. See, this is my talent. I could be a bad-ass scout. I got my finger on the pulse of next generation, baby. How you know she's gonna be down for this, man? Oh, she's down. Trust me. She's down. Plus, she sucks on my fingers while I'm fucking her, bro. -Oh yeah? That's cool. -Yeah. That's cool. You know what that means? She likes fingers. You're so cute. Means she likes having a Dick in her mouth while getting fucked. It's a tell-a-tell sign, bro. -Oh yeah. -Yeah. Anytime a girl puts something in her mouth while fucking either they're familiar with that scenario or they're intrigued by that scenario. Think about it, man. It's just logic. I never thought about it that way. Yeah man. You know, that's what Lexi did. When he first started dating, Lexi would suck on my fingers while I was fucking her. That's what schooled me to the knowledge that she had slept with more than one dude at a time before. So when I proposed a threesome, she was in, she didn't fight it, she fucking loved it. -Huh? -Yeah. Well, what do you think Lexi is gonna think about all this though? Dude, Lexi's the bane of my fucking existence, man. Everything that's gone wrong in my life for the last 15 years, pretty much steps back to her. I've forgiven her over and over again. I overlooked so much shit in the name of forgiveness. But it doesn't matter. She always fucks me-- Hey, how you doing, sir? Go look up the Lexi Lane Ashley Blue gang-bang. In the end I'm fucking Ashley. So I wasn't paying attention. Lexi starts badmouthing me to the male talent on camera saying that I'm limp dick and shit, and that's a total fucking lie. Of course I can get it up. Right? I didn't know this until the fucking DVD came out. I wanted to knock that bitch out. Anyway, don't say shit. That stays between us. -I got you brother. -You got the next set. -Here is your tip. -Thank you. So I joined your Pornhub page. -You watching my scenes? -Checked out a few. I watched the one you won best oral for. Yeah? Yeah. Not that it's not hot watching you, but like-- Yeah? So the girl plus all the guys she's blown-- Hello, Mr. Mikey. Hi, Ms. Phan. Uh, I swept outside and watered the plant for you. Great. So the girl plus all the guys she's blowing win the award? Right. But we all share it, the award. Okay. But like she's on her knees blowing the line of guys. It's like her scene. Why are you winning an award for it? Okay, well. That's up for discussion. Anyway you shouldn't be watching that stuff. You know, just pretend it doesn't exist. Don't watch that stuff. It's not good. I'm sorry. -Did I hurt your feelings? -No, it's okay. Sorry. I should've asked if it was okay if I watched. Check out the Fast & the Furry-Ass paradise. -Are you serious? -Hell yeah. Fast & Furry-Ass. Yeah. I love it. Love it. Right? I play Brian O'Connor, that's Paul Walker's character. And my acting was next level, seriously. I mean, my scenes were miles above the other scenes. To this day, people tweet me like oh you were the perfect O'Connor. I was actually even nominated for that role, best supporting actor in a parody. But I didn't win. It was a big snap of the night. It was booze and everything. It was crazy. And then Paul Walker goes and gets himself killed, which is such a bummer because then I'm fucked out of the sequels. -That sucks. -Yeah. So-- You wanna come over this weekend? Come over. What? To your place? Yeah. We could spend Saturday night there. No, no. I'm not into the whole meet the parents. You think that I'd introduce you to my mom? Are you fucking kidding me? No. God, no, no. She'll be out of town. She got a new boyfriend and they're going to Houston to fuck themselves silly. So we got the place to our own, to fuck ourselves even sillier. -Mikey? -Yeah.

And she's trying to help me out. And we could tell her about how things are going well here. And you know-- like you and me and all. Because I mean-- if things are going well here, you and me and all, and I get clean test-- And that's gonna happen? No wonder they took him. You right back to where you were, and over it all over again. Where's his dad in all this shit anyway? Why doesn't he step the fuck up? Seriously. Better yet, why doesn't Leondria go with you being that she's so concerned with our fucking business? You know what? Fuck this place. I'm going to go watch TV with your mom. Don't judge. Okay?

Oh yeah? -Yeah. I don't understand. Slave trade, silly. Slaves were sold here. Something like famous French pirate ran the show. A French pirate? I bet he had really good style.
