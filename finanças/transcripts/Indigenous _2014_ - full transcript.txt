My name is Scott Williams. This isn't a joke. I'm an American tourist in Panama. We're in the Darién jungle. I don't think this is gonna work. There's no service here. We went too far into the jungle and... we don't know where we are and some thing is chasing us. If you're watching this video, please get this to somebody that can help us. My... please help us. Two of my friends... yo, what up, douchebag? When are you guys getting your asses down here? We leave in two hours. - Oh, and you're not at the airport? - No, still waiting on Steph. - Is that her in the shower? - Yeah. - Why don't you give me a little look? - No way, asshole. - Come on, friends. - Looks like all you guys got there safely? Oh, yeah. Qué pasa, hombre? Hola, Caballero. What time did you get there? This morning. This place is so beautiful. You guys are gonna love it. By the time you guys get your asses down here, I'm gonna be so shit-faced you won't even recognize me. Oh, is that Steph? - Who is that? - Do you have to ask? We're gonna leave all this behind for the next 10 days. Yeah, of course. No work, programming, nothing. Just you and me. I'll reward you for your sacrifice. I've been practicing my downward dog. There's something extremely sexy about a veterinarian in training that uses animal innuendo. Really? Well, it'll only get better when I become an actual vet. As long as you don't try to anal gland clean me. I can't promise that. I can still hear you guys. That is some kinky-ass shit. Yo, get your asses down here now. Panama, baby. Get down here, guys. Yeah! Whoo! Peace. Okay, so, Steph, we're in Panama here. First impressions? First impressions? Uh, I'm wondering if this thing is gonna be on the whole time we're here. We have to show the world what we're experiencing. No. The entire world doesn't need to see everything. Okay. Thank you. Is that our guy? Hey. Hey, strangers. Hi! What took you guys so long? This place is in the middle of nowhere, man. Go check in. The bar is waiting. This place is perfect. It's paradise. Come on. See you guys later. Mind if I join you? Uh, yeah. Yeah, actually I really do mind. This shower is way too small for two people, so... no more time for jokes, funny boy. Ladies, caballeros. Dear god, a speech. Needle dick. Oh, cheers. It's been amazing growing up and traveling the world with such an awesome group of friends. Like you, Trevor. That's really cute. That's really cute. We've surfed the world together. But this might be the last time... Before the real world swallows us and spits us out. - Let's make it count. - Cheers, guys. All right, ¡salud! Whoo! - Fuckin' already go. - Go, go, go! - Let's go! - - Yeah! - So, how excited are you? - I'm really excited. Give it up! Yeah! I just got accepted into a veterinarian school. Congrats. Speaking of excitement, congratulations on your new restaurant, Elena. Thank you. I read about the soft opening online. The food looks amazing. - Yeah. Charlie's a maestro. - Fuck off. No, I'm serious, dude. I can still taste the Gambas al Ajillo. That's good. That's good. What else was it? The... - Albóndigas. - What came with it? Spanish Rioja. That was actually my idea. Yes, delicious. Oh, yeah. And I'm just the guy that cooks it and prepares it, right? - I'll race you. - No. Come on. Yeah? Come on! You gotta do it. If I win, I'll go talk to those two hotties right there. They're not really hotties. But okay. Aw, come on. Don't look at that. And if you lose? If I lose, I'll still go talk to those two hotties right there. Countdown! Uno, dos, tres. Go, go, go! Go, go, go. Oh, fuck! Now, I'm gonna go see if one of them wants to show me their Panamanian canal. Come on! - That was tacky. - That wasn't even a funny tacky. Okay. - Born and bred right here. - Trevor. Yo, mate. Charlie. Scott. - You guys enjoying Panama so far? - Lovin' it. Look at this. Beautiful view, super-chill people. - What's not to like? - Panama is a good choice. Surfing, seafood and the women. Let's drink for that. No, no, no. So I said, "mum, dad, I'm not gay. He was sucking my dick." Okay, okay. One more. What do you say we get out of here? And how about you, buddy? What's the next step for you? Shit, man. I don't know. If I knew, I'd tell you. The economy's shit right now. And my student loans are about to go into repayment. I really don't want to have to move back in with my folks. It's always a bummer, dude. Especially since the old man, he's always saying, "Scott, your generation just doesn't want to work hard enough." It's bullshit. Most of us want to work hard, we just don't have the jobs to work hard in. - Hey. - Cheers, bro. Hey, babe. Have you ever heard of this Darién gap place? - What? - It's this jungle. It's close by. Really close by. So you could actually drive all the way from Alaska to Argentina... If it weren't for this little piece of jungle. Don't you think that's weird? No. Why? This is Panama, I mean, they built the Panama canal, they cut two continents in half. What makes it so difficult to get through this jungle? Holy shit. Honey, are you gonna be on that thing all night? Shh. This is why we're here, boys. - Baltic, '08? - That was cold. Cornwall, 2010. - That was lame, man. It was pretty flat. - That's my local joint. Costa Rica, the Caribbean. That was somewhat of a letdown. Now for the pacific. - You ladies done talking? - Hell, yeah. Whoo! Have you seen that video with the teenagers that went missing out here in the jungle? Yeah. What's that mean? So far, it's all speculation as to what happened. Online they said that the locals here believe... It had something to do with some sort of chupacabra thing. What is that anyhow? The chupacabra my grandparents swore to exist. It's not an animal. My people believe that the chupacabra is like... like a demon. It's not human or animal. It's like an evil spirit trapped in a half-human, half-monster body. And apparently it's the reason why the Darién gap still exists. No one wants to enter those jungles. It's a pity. There's a great little waterfall inside the jungle. We all used to go there when we were kids. But because of all the trouble, we're not allowed to go there anymore. It's a big world, guys. There's a lot of shit we don't know about or understand. It's just that he's become so self-involved. Everything is about him. Everything's about Charlie. Sorry. I mean, it must be stressful with the new restaurant. Yeah. Anyways... you look beautiful. - How are you and Scott doing? - We're good. - You wanna see what he's been working on? - Yes, I do. Right now, it's still in beta mode. - What's beta mode? - Oh, programmer talk for work in progress. Or as I call it: Don't blame me if it doesn't work yet. Here, all right. Now, send a shout-out to your friends back home. No. Yes. How do I look? Good. Hi, everyone. We arrived safely in Panama. We're having a great time with even greater people. Hi. And we hope to see you when we get back. I love you all. - That was terrible. - So it has this facial recognition thing, it uploads it to YouTube and Facebook... And then recognizes the contacts in your phone... And automatically tags them. See? Look. Cool, huh? Yeah. You guys are gonna be rich. I want a cut. So Julio, we're thinking about visiting that waterfall tomorrow. What were you saying about it again? What? Wait, what did she say about the waterfall? She's talking about the same waterfall that Julio's talking about. It's apparently some amazing place they used to go to as kids... - But, uh, I guess now it's off-limits. - Yeah. - Off-limits? - Yeah. No, doesn't sound like a good idea. We can't go there, guys. Why can't we go there? Apparently, there's some local legend that forbids it. Honestly, guys, I don't see what the big deal is. There's this beautiful place, like, how far away is it? It's about an hour drive and an hour hike. Okay. So there's this beautiful place, what, two hours away, and apparently it's a mythical pool of untouched waters... That brings good health and good luck. And we can have it all to ourselves. And we don't want to go there? Trevor, will this, uh, mythical waterfall... Make your penis any larger, or are you out of luck? Oh, it'll give you a huge penis, like jumbo cock. Come on. Sounds great. But didn't you guys come here for the beach and the surf? Who cares about the beach and the surf? This place sounds cooler. You've never seen a waterfall before? Not a waterfall with a mythical pool. Look, it's not safe anymore. Bad thing has been happening there. Okay. You know, if you take us, we'll be all alone. But isn't it dangerous? Why would they say it's off-limits? Probably just to prevent tourists from spoiling the place. Besides, it's just a myth. I mean, how many tourists do you know... That have been killed by the loch ness monster lately? Yeah, or bigfoot, right? I guess, yeah. Look. I wouldn't put you guys in any danger. But what about the video? I mean, what attacked those kids? It's just a hoax. I mean, come on. You've seen the video. You can't even see anything in it. Come on, Steph. You're studying animals. I bet there's no section on the old chupacabra. Okay, if you can guarantee it's safe. Yeah, it's totally safe. See? "It's totally safe." I'm not going. Come on, Elena. What can we do to convince you? No. You guys go off and have your little adventure. I'll be relaxing and sipping cocktails poolside. Fuck it, man. I'm in. Me too. Okay. "Okay," you're in? Okay, I'm in. Sweet! Can you pick us up in the morning? Or you can just stay at my place. No. Yet. Hey, there she is! Stop, stop, stop. All right. Let's do this. Come on. Whoo-hoo! Oh, wait, wait. Stop. Hey, guys. Wait up. Stop. Stop, stop, stop. Hey, I thought you weren't coming. I changed my mind. Oh, god. Tatiana, hola. Ciao. Ciao. - Okay, guys. It's time to hike. - All right. Come on. The thing about hidden treasures is that they're hidden. You don't say, Columbo? Hey, needle dick. Trevor. Oh, I thought you were talking to Charlie again. All right, play narrator and tell us a little bit about our surroundings. What we've got here... Are the famous, dense, lush jungles of Panama. Green as far as the eye can see. Oh, Crickey. What is it? What have we got here? Nestled deep within the jungle is a majestic beauty. Hair like the midnight sky. It's beautiful. I'm gonna poke it. Cut! Nice, dude. Real nice. Thanks, yeah. Is everything okay? So, what are you guys scared of? I'm not afraid of anything. Right now I'm scared we're never gonna find this place. Don't worry. We're almost there, guys. We were almost there half an hour ago. Steph's afraid of the dark. No! Not all the time. Come on, name one situation that was ever made better by darkness. What are you talking about? Darkness has helped ugly people like Trevor here to get laid... Since the beginning of time. Your mom was great, by the way. Good one. That's a good one. - Holy shit, guys. - Check it out. Oh, my god. Are you guys seeing this? - Wow. - I told you. It's worth it. Come on. - Oh, my god. - Watch your step. It's beautiful. So these are the mystical falls? Wow. Charlie, how deep do you think this is? Only one way to find out. Charlie. Where'd he... where'd he go? Charlie! I can't see anything. This isn't funny. Charlie! Charlie! Charlie! Asshole. Fucking hell, Elena. I was just taking the piss. Not here. Hey, where are you guys going? Oh, yeah, uh, we're gonna go look at plants. You going over that way? 'Cause I hear the jungle is really nice over that way. Enjoy the local wildlife, mate. You okay, hon? Yeah. Yeah. I just want to get out of the water for a bit. Don't worry about me. Go have fun. Where are you taking me? Uh, someplace where? All right. How do you say "blue balls" in Spanish? That's what you're giving me right now. You should go talk to Elena. - She's being so difficult. - She's just being a woman. Watch it. Seriously, you guys have been through a lot. You need to work it out. You should trust her. She's gonna be a veterinarian. All right. But if I don't make it out alive, it's your fault. Hey. Hey. Hey, it's Scott. Scott. If you're looking for me, I'm in Panama having the time of my life. Leave me a message and I will call you back as soon as I can. Scott, it's Julio. You guys need to stop fucking around and get back to me. Please, man. This is not funny. Call me as soon as possible. You guys need to get the fuck out of there. This is not a joke. Pretty, isn't it? Oh! I'll get you. Things are gonna get better from now on, okay? I promise. I promise too. And... thank you. It's probably just Scott with his camera. Let's give him something to beat off to. Charlie, go sort out your shit with Elena. Get your dick wet somewhere else. Oh, it's nothing. It's nothing. There's nothing there. No. - No, no. - Go look, please. Come on, it's nothing. Go look, please. Oh, fuck. Fucking waste of time. There's nothing here. Trevor! There's nothing here! Where are you? What the hell was that? Carmen! Carmen, where are you? Trevor! Trevor! Oh. What the fuck? - Guys! Guys, where are you? - Trevor, Trevor! Hey, guys. Scott! Have you guys seen Carmen? What happened? We heard screaming. I went to go check out a noise nearby. She screamed. I came back and I found these. - Jesus, what the hell? - Oh, my god. What's going on? This better not be a joke. I'm not fucking joking! There's something out there! This was a mistake. Okay, everybody calm down. I'm sure there's a reasonable explanation for all of this, okay? It's okay. Carmen! Carmen! This is not good. We gotta get out of here. We can't just leave her. What the f... - do you have signal? - Yeah, I got a bar. Give it to me. Is that Carmen's phone? Yeah, it's coming from down there. Go. Come on. Carmen! Hey, guys, guys. Here we go. It's right here. Carmen! Carmen, where are you? - Carmen! - Carmen, fuck! Calm down, all right? Just calm down. We have to get out of here. It's gonna be dark soon. Oh, fuck! Give me the phone. I'm gonna call the hotel. I'll explain what happened. - Tell 'em where we are. - It's gonna be fine. Okay? Fuck. - What? - There's no service. - You just used it. - Try again. No. - No, there's nothing. - Shit. What are we gonna do? We'll go up to higher ground, all right? My service has been on and off since we got here. We'll go up higher until I can make a call. Okay. It's gonna be all right. Okay? Trevor. Okay? Yeah, fine. All right, man. Fine. All right. Let's go. Fuck! Oh! - You know where you're going? - Yeah, I think so. Damn it, none of this looks familiar. Hey, come on. Come on. - Will you guys keep up? - Hey, what the fuck's your problem? The same as your fucking problem. We're in the jungle with something hunting us. Stop fighting. Hey, come on. Keep up, keep up. Yeah. Shit. Okay. Fuck. Hey, everybody chill. We got a voice mail from Julio. Scott, it's Julio. You guys need to stop fucking around and get back to me. Please, man. This is not funny. Call me as soon as possible. You guys need to get the fuck out of there. We got to get the fuck out of here. What's gotten into him? He's just scared shitless. I am not scared shitless. We just got to get the fuck out of here. Oh, shit! What was that? What the fuck was that? Did anyone see that? What the fuck was that? We gotta get out of here. Let's go. Let's go. Run! Come on, let's go! I can't see shit. I can't see shit. Hey, hey! Fuck. Fuck. Fuck! Come on, come on. Come on! Guys! Guys! Guys, where the fuck are you? Guys! Shit! Elena! Elena! Charlie? Guys, wait up! Elena! Slow down, Scott. Slow down. Slow down. Shit. Scott! Steph! Where'd they go? Scott! Steph! Charlie! Charlie. Elena. No, no. Charlie, where are you? Elena! Elena! Scott! Where the fuck are you? Charlie! Charlie! No... Charlie! Elena! Elena! Elena. Oh... oh, god. Charlie. Charlie, no... please, god! - Look, Elena! - Elena, we gotta go. We've gotta go back! Elena, shut the fuck up! - Fuck, fuck! - Shit! Come. - Charlie's dead. - What? We just left him there. - Shit, shit, shit. - What happened? I've never heard an animal like that. Hey, it's gonna be okay. Everybody just chill. We gotta figure this out. - We need to get out of here! - Don't you think I fucking know that? Just... there's no use stating the fucking obvious. Gonna figure this out. I just gotta think this through. No, no. Where was your fucking thinking when I told you there was something out there? Where was your thinking when you brought Carmen alone... In the middle of the jungle to fuck her? You fucking idiot. Everyone shut up! Shh! It's just the wind. We need to rest, Scott. Just a little further. You want us to get more lost, and then we can rest? My cell coverage is coming in and out here. Let's try going higher. I'll go up. You just stay down here. Let's give you and Elena a little break. Okay. Just be careful, okay? Yeah. I'll be fine. It's just a little ways up. Trevor, just stay down here, all right? - Yeah. - I'll be right back. Fuck! My name is Scott Williams. This isn't a joke.

Over the jungles of Panama. There it is. Locals have confirmed that five American tourists... Were last seen venturing into the Darién gap yesterday morning. Stay... stay back. Stay back. Come on, let's go. Let's go. Come on, come on. This way, this way! Let's go! - Do you guys hear that? - It sounds like a helicopter. It is a helicopter! Run! Come on, keep moving! Steph. Shit. Oh! Just fucking go! Go! - No! - Go... no, no, no. No fucking way am I leaving you here. - Go! Go! - Elena, go flag down the helicopter. Okay? Go. Go, go, go! I'll come back for you guys. Just hang in there, babe. Hang in. Baby, it's gonna hurt, okay? Okay. Okay. It's gonna hurt. Count of three. One. Two. Three. It's okay. It's okay. 232 square kilometers of dense jungle... Make it almost impossible for aerial sightings. Hey! Over here! Okay. Okay. Almost home, baby. Confirmed reports are coming in... That the TVN chopper has located one of the tourists. What you're seeing is the first breakthrough of the search. It appears to be Elena Cadera, the American restaurant owner living and working in London. The families back home can only be praying that the others are close by. Fuck. Fuck! Just go. Just go! It is still unknown whether the chopper will be able to land or not. Elena Cadera looks to be in good health. We're witnessing some sort of vicious attack on live TV! Shit. God! It's okay. Your leg's fine, all right? I think we're gonna be fine. We can still make it out of here. Okay. I love you. Scott! No! Scott! Scott! No! No! Scott! We're receiving unconfirmed reports coming out of the Darién jungle... That armed military personnel have located two more survivors. Scott Williams and Stephanie Logan from California... Have been found with various unknown injuries. The search continues for the others. The two rescued Americans will be taken to Panama City for immediate questioning. The world is expecting answers. Authorities are keeping the media at bay... While the survivors recover in a local hospital. These events from the Darién gap have garnered worldwide attention. Reports and sightings of Cryptids from all over the world... Are being given media scrutiny. Authorities and news outlets from China, Italy and Russia... Are being inundated with sightings of indigenous monsters. What was once categorized as conspiracy theories and urban legends... Are now receiving front-page attention. Sightings of the chupacabra... not hungry today, Mr. Scott? The notorious bloodsucking south American creature, are now being reported in Texas. You should get some rest. Panamanian government has increased resources... To find the remaining missing tourists. However, with every passing hour, the possibility of rescue becomes increasingly dire. Our thoughts and prayers go out... To the families of the remaining missing foreigners, who are desperate for any signs of life.
