You know, if the chosen ones are infected with virus x, they'll become Galactors. Don't worry. As long as the stone is shining, they'll still protect us even though they were infected. But what if the light of the stone has faded? Until then... Year 2015 Eastern Europe 21 st Century Strange monsters appeared everywhere. A large-scale war is spreading throughout the world. A red light armor that can hold against all attacks, it didn't work in the various wars initiated by mankind. The 1 7th day after the war started. Half of the world has been subdued by unknown forces. These new conquerors called themselves as Galactors. Many people were killed. The world is filled with grief and agony. Many children have lost their parents and siblings were separated. Humanity are only allowed to live in certain regions. They are waiting for extinction. And they put their last hope on one thing. Ken! Run! Ken! Hand over the stone! Ken! Are you awake, The Chosen One? This incredible crystal known as stone possesses power to control the superhero ninja agents. We called them as Gatchaman. 1 3 Years Later, Tokyo. 1 9th, Galactors have appeared in North Sanriku connecting with North Kitakyushu. ln addition, this month's unempolyment rate is 29.3%. Has increased 2.5% compared to last month. Overseas migration exceeded 9 millions people. Sis! l can buy with my salary. Don't worry. No. Why you need so much clothes for your mission? Since it's a submerge mission, of course l need more clothes. What do you mean? lt's about human observation and intelligence gathering... Hey! You can't tell anyone about... the Ministry of Home Affairs' main objective! Why not? You can't tell anyone. You're doing something that you shouldn't be as well. lt's confidential. lf using proper channels... That'll be too complicated, so we're sneaking in. Hey, let's steal the recipes of that 3-star restaurant, what do you say? You're so low. Just forget about it! Don't worry. We'll see again very soon. Yes. Bye. Oh, yes. Mom, you should listen to doctor's advice. Take medicine according to time so that you can recover soon. Yes. Thank you. Mission completed. This day has finally come. Our enemy is the lSO conference. (lSO: lnternational Science Organization) Scientists, the governments, endophytes and plutocrats... from all over the world are our targets. Comebat Code, Last Suicide The final... suicide. Though this is the first combat for you, but it is the last combat as well. Understood. What's that? Galactors have showed up. Strange weapons are approaching Nishi-Shinjuku's defensive line. Everyone! Repeat one more time! lt's the Galactors... Hurry! Jinpei! Dodge! Fire! Suprisingly, the Galactors and human DNA are 99% identical. lSO Tokyo branch. The 1 % difference is virus X. Human civilization destruction, the thing that had claimed countless lives... With horrific power, this is... Virus X. Western calendar, Year 1 71 8. We've uncovered 28 unknown crystals from the ancient ruins in Africa lnland. We called them as stone. Red alert. The Galactors are approaching. Expected target is our building. Please move to the evacuation zones immediately. Please be quiet, everyone. Don't worry. We've made a plan. The light emits from the stone is generally known as G-particles. lt can defeat the faceless, armoured Galactors, detroy Virus X, and suppress destruction activities. Evil people, can you see the substanceless but only white shadow me? As we touch it, it's just a stone. But as lSO agents touch it, it'll become light of hope. They gather together the chosen ones, provide them with trainings, and turn them into supreme weapons against the Galactors. Ken Washio. Jinpei Ohtsuki. G-Force Science Ninja Team! Don't be so happy. Ryu Nakanishi. Jun Ohtsuki. l was going to take care of both... Something bigger is waiting for us. Yes. The enemy's weapons are heading East along Yasukuni Highway at 40km/h. Estimated to arrive at lSO in 7:20 minutes. Massive fire rips through Shinjuku! Neutron weapons are requested! This is HQ! Neutron weapons are prohibited! G-Force will be right there. This is G-Force! Reaching destination in 40 seconds. Understood. Well, the 3-star recipes, l'm counting on you. l know you're going to say like that. This isn't the time to chit-chat! Target's found in the city center. After the target via the coffee shop in Shinjuku-sanchome. Roger! ldentical with the registered model 363B in database and evidence. PCB bombs, huh? Which has taken millions of lives... Retreat! And stop it! Roger! Roger! This monster... Jun! Understood! Ryu! Jinpei! They're coming... Micro bombs. Enemy's weapons are 2,000 meters away from lSO HQ. 3 minutes until explosion. Ouch! Are you serious? Get ready! lt's so hot! Jinpei! What's wrong, Jinpei? Don't stop, Jun! 50 seconds until explosion! Disarm the bomb first! Yes, understood! Laser! George Asakura! Amazing! Who is he? You know him? Alright! The last one! Huh? No way! Why? 30 seconds left. Jupiter enters moon's shadow! Gate opens! Hey! What is this all about?! 1 0 seconds left. Sis! Alright! Well done, Ken! George! Who is he? You know him? Haha! They're brother and sister. They were asking the same thing. Huh? Oh, yes. You should use your brain more, Ryu. Huh? So that it'll become like a computer in 21 st century. Why do you know about us? Data about you two have been recored basically. l'm George Asakura, from lSO Europe. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. lSO East Asia Branch. Thank you for saving Jinpei. We won't be this lucky all the time. The mission is much more important. You must complete the mission even if l'm in danger. Yes! This is our rules, right? George seems like your old friend. Yeah. We've known each other for 1 3 years. We've been together ever since our parents were killed by Galactors. Same as you, Jinpei. My parents are still alive. The enemy has taken them captive. l see. l'm sorry. l'll save them out one day. l want to cook something delicious! And it was really funny back there. This gorilla had fallen heavily into the tub. Don't make fun of others! You're gonna pay for it someday! Sheesh! Gorilla! Alright! That's enough. l've heard enough! At this rate, both of you will be together when there's a mission, huh? No way! l've had enough being together with this gorilla! Ohtsuki-chan, the way your brother talks as if he's looking for a fight. Anti-gravity response... Do as you please. We shall see later. How about Ryu? He seems strong but always goes to the hospital. Just a slightly runny nose, he'll go to the hospital immediately. But this place is like a hospital, ain't it? Whether you're sneezing or coughing, just go to the HQ. Yeah. Hey, do we need to record data like this as well? The relationship between the two of you, l can tell even if without data. You mean this gorilla and me? Come on! With a monkey, huh? That's disgusting! Hey, what about Ken? What does he normally do? l'm not sure. All l know is that he eats hotdog every day. l don't know what's on his mind. Ken, he will only obey to the rules set by himself. Oh, yes. My sister confessed to him just recently and got rejected. Jinpei! She's been rejected! You should've told us! l didn't say anything. A woman that can't cook, of course she'll get rejected. Later on, he felt relieved and restless somehow. lt must be Naomi! Huh? The reason she got rejected. Naomi? A love triangle, huh? lt's just like l thought. Naomi! Are you the kind of girls that will get fired up when having competitors? Yes. Oh. No. That's not what l mean. Sis! l got you! Not bad. l don't hate this kind of... No! l'm not talking about this... Yeah! Ken has rejected you, but it's not recorded in the data. How's the situation in Europe? We've tried our best to rescue the refugees that sent the distress signal. But all that's waiting us was mountain of corpses. The Galactors were a step ahead us. One of them can kill up to 1 00 thousands of people. They were just a year earlier than us stepping into the world of real combat. My freedom was taken since l was a boy. l've been training hard. Even so, l still couldn't do anything. What's the meaning of living? There's no need for a meaning. The stone chose us. Only the chosen ones can beat the Galactors. Hence, we've no choice. You've changed, Ken. You've become better. l just want to avenge Naomi. Are you serious? Dr. Kirkland. The experiment has entered the final stage. You don't need those toys to help you save the future anymore. Now you can end the war with this. And you can't reject it. Excuse me. You'll gain back your freedom very soon. What do you think, Captain George? George might break the rules and disrupt the teamwork. Like you in 5 years ago? Yes. Go back to Tokyo. Last Suicide isn't over yet. Enemy's actual target is here. The cadres of Glactors that were fighting with you have opened the moving door and another door has appeared in north of 203 district 84 at the same time. Berg Katse has sneaked into Tokyo while we we were focusing on repelling sayibowu break. But Berg Katse is a girl. l'm surprised. l hope we can catch her as soon as possible. Not after we gathered info from the intelligence department. We still have some other missions. Protect the info provider. As long as he's alive, the truth of Last Suicide will be revealed. ls the info he provided genuine? Yes. His name is llya. The second-rate person of Galactors. But she was defeated by Berg Katse in jockeying for power. Now he's escaped to Tokyo... and brought back some information. You got what l mean? We must protect lriya at all costs. And stop Last Suicide! Understood. Here's an advise for you, George. Don't kill lriya. The future is much more important than revenge now? Yes. So, you shouldn't kill lriya. After 6 hours, Tokyo. l'm counting on you. Okay. How is it? Hey! At least say something! Are you stuck on me? How is it, Jinpei? Wait! Just a little... Hurry! We're almost there! Please take care of them, George. Got it. Please come in. Please come in. Please put your hands here. Please put your hands here. Hurry! Jinpei! l got it! Please put your hands here. Please put your hands here, Sir. Please do it again. Are you okay? This is strange. lt's broken, huh? What a beautiful necktie! l'm sorry. lt's okay. That's so close. Take back Europe. And take back hometown. Go find lriya. Wait a minute. Couple posing game is over. Tell me about lriya. What has happened? You've told George, but why you're hiding it from your teammates? While you were in the training camp, George and another teammate and l were already having combat training at the border of Europe. The three of us have been together since the training began. But 5 years ago, as we were rescuing the refugees attacked by Galactors, one was killed. lriya was the one that killed her. ln other words, we're now protecting our friend's enemy. The one that was killed, is she Naomi? George has told you about it. You like Naomi, don't you? lt has nothing to do with you. Will it halt us from being together? No way! No! That's not what l meant! l'm sick of this conversation. Don't worry, Jun. Naomi belongs to me. We love each other. Ken's being supportive, too. Both of you are perfect match. That's great. Thank goodness. Let's find lriya then. Wait, what did you just say? 5 years ago in Central Asia. You didn't hear it, huh? You frightened me. You mean you want to get married? Yes. Please marry me, Naomi. Who would propose in a place like this? More witnesses, the better. You're so carefree. The truceline is 4 kilometers away. l'd like to settle it up before the mission ends. Congratulations. l did it, Ken! The prioritization is very strange. l'll protect you with all my life, Naomi. Finally we've deployed agents in Tokyo. We're here to protect you, lriya-san. Great! The earphone seems to be broken, Jinpei. l heard some stray noise. l got it. l'll send you a new one right away. Please wait. Okay. l've a grasp of information about you. Let me see your face to check whether you're the real person. lf you're fake, l'll kill everyone here. Long time no see. ls it okay now? Am l confirmed an exile now? Well, not before you tell us about the meaning of Last Suicide. Huh? What?! Are you trying to fool me? Jinpei. Hey, something's wrong with the wireless, huh? What are you doing? Jinpei. Hey. hungry? Yeah. Where are you, Ryu? This is strange. Damn it! Jun! Ryu! Damn! We've been betrayed. Jun! Sis! Brother! Protect lriya, Jinpei. l see. lf l fire at this distance, l can kill you instantly. Pulling gun at me, huh? Put down the gun. You hate him, don't you? Our mission is to protect him, not killing him. But he killed Naomi. Be cool. Just put down the gun. This is our duty. Hey, Ken. You like Naomi too, don't you? Come on! Don't make me pull my gun at you. l'll protect you with all my life, Naomi. Thank you. George! George! George! George! George! George! George! George! George! George! George! George! Damn it! No, Ken! The power of the stone is fading! Retreat immediately! But... This is an order, Ken! Ken! Naomi! Once the body and soul are depleted, the power of the stone will disappeared. You must come out now! Can't you obey to a simple rules like this? Where's Naomi? Haven't found her body yet. George refuses to team up with you. l'll take the responsibility. Please allow me to withdraw myself. You're not allowed since you're the chosen one. We'll transfer you to East Asia region. Damn it! Human is a foolish creature. lf you resist, 600 tons of liquid ammonia will be frozen, and you'll be locked in an armoured cage. ls this how you treat an exile? What is Last Suicide? Tell me! l'll be punished if l tell you. l didn't receive any order like that. Order? Who cares? Just kill me if you want to! You're free now. Alright, tell me now! You love that woman, don't you? And l've killed her. What are you doing in Tokyo? When did you become like this? When? You want to kill me but you can't. You've to keep me alive before receiving further command and information. You're like a dog that can't disobey order! What is Last Suicide? No. Were you the one that made her suicide? Tell me! Well, you should be killed instead. Answer me! Killing youself? Using your own hands. What? Last Suicide is a plan to wipe out all the lSO's scientists and important persons in Tokyo. But only Berg Katse knows how to do it. Alright! You can kill me now. Why would Berg Katse sneak into Tokyo? Listen here. Berg Katse has gone nuts. You'll be attacked if you don't do it. Sir. What is it, Dr. Kirkland? That's the plan. But it's still in experimental stage. l live because of this. MOSCON was developed for a moment like this. So we must success! ls Dr. Kirkland here? Please forward my message to him. l'd like to repent about something particular. l've killed your wife. No, l didn't kill her. l tortured her to death after interrogation. Why? Because she's Kirkland's wife. Shut up! lt's live ammunition this time. To know what Dr. Kirkland is developing, a dreadful interrogation worse than dying was being used on her. Shut up! But, just put it down. Turn off the video recording. She didn't say anything. Because she really loved you, Doctor. Everyone. l have a suggestion. A standby command. Huh? Standby? What?! Are we going to wait until Tokyo is being attacked? Dr. Kirkland is going to execute his battling strategy. Doctor and his laboratory have developed a MOSCON that will emit streamline beam from the satellite. Emitting streamline beam from artificial satellite? Yes. lt can destroy the armours. And wipe out all Galactors in the center of Casablanca. What? What about the captive? Many people were being enslaved there. Even Dr. Nambu's family is over there. Sacrifices are necessary for operation execution. We are the chosen ones. Come on, wake up! Just leave me alone. Normally you can't move for a week after being hit by high-voltage electric bullet. We are agents. l see. Hey, Ken. Will you still hit me if it's a real bullet? Our mission is absolute. That's our rules. But Naomi wouldn't do the same. She'll protect you even if breaking the rules. Bear that in mind. l want to talk to lriya. Be careful. l've received your message. Really? We were able to eliminate Galactors, it's all thanks to my wife for protecting the information. lt can't be helped. l'll kill you afterwards. l'll find you even though you're being protected and hidden. l'll kill you with my own hands! And so? Just go ahead and do what you want. You're saving a lot of work for me. Target is MOSCON, huh? But my... MOSCON cannot be activated without motorizes devices, huh? Someone like you, it's impossible that you didn't take it along. Can you hear me, Ken? Yes. lriya has escaped! Pursue him immediately! Where's Jinpei? Capture lriya is more important now! Understood! l'm coming to save you, Jinpei. Wait! Bastard! Good boy. 5th Century B.C. Virus X was brought here from the space. Those got infected were called as zombie in some regions. While some called them as dracula... or devil. And they were being attacked. During world war ll, virus x was being used by some countries as military purpose. People assumed that the research result on defeat has disappeared. But after half a century. A scientist from Pulaha discovered an underground laboratory.... and got infected with Virus X. And his name was Berg Katse. Berg Katse? We got infected with Virus X, and evolved into Galactors. But not everybody will get infected. The probability is one out of 800 millions. Yes. The chosen ones for stone are the chosen ones for Virus X as well. They possess the possibilty of evolving. Transforming is so tiring. You are... Virus X is omnipotent. No way. Because of death, l can manipulate freely as l want. l can turn into any shapes. You treasure the same ring that we shared. Are you really Naomi? Can you remember it now? Those that got infected with Virus X and became Galactors are increasing over time. As Berg Katse came back to life, it's reached almost 300 peoples. Men were entrusted to inherit. And his name was Berg Katse, too. The second generation. He wanted to wipe out 70 millions of human with 300 Galactors. lt's a good chance as lSO started to recruit the chosen ones. They've helped us to gather up those that can evolve into Galactors. Hence, l've joined them since then. l was given the chance to choose for the first time ever since l was born. Either to be an agent or a Galactor. l've chosen freedom. What? George has made his choice. Now l'll let you choose. Do you smell Virus X from my lips? Congratulations. You've got infected. Naomi. That's not my name anymore. My name is Berg Katse. lriya isn't the third generation, but l am. l'm entrusted as the symbol of freedom. George wasn't bound by any rules ever since he was young. l like you about the freedom part. But what about the stone? You were enslaved by humans because of this stone. You've lost your freedom. l'm not a slave. Then why you want to be an agent? To seek revenge and avenge someone. But l'm still alive. You'll gain freedom when you evolve into something surpasses human. Forget your vengeance. And live on freely! Dear George. Jupiter has entered moon's shadow. Look. Once you join the Galactors, you can open up the door to the other world. lnspection result. Their compatibility rates are much more higher than the benchmark. This way please. You're pissed that your parents were killed, huh? l want to banish the Galactors. Me too! How about you, George? Me too! Well, l'll give you a chance. Doctor. l'm waiting for you. l heard a... woman's voice. lt sounds like... l can't answer it, it's illogical. Yes. Declare the war. Where am l? Puny human. Never ending retaliation. How selfish. You wanted to avenge your wife that's why you created MOSCON. Endless retaliation after retaliation. l'll release you from it. What?! There's only one way to stop the chain of retaliation! We won't use the weapons created by human! Let human use it themselves. And kill themselves with their own hands! This is the so called Last Suicide. What does justice mean to you after killing millions of people? Though we don't have justice as a human, but we have our own justice as Galactors. l know what's the enemy's target. lt's Dr. Kirkland's MOSCON. They approach us in order to hijack him. Dr. Kirkland is going to use his own body as MOSCON's control device. The enemy wants to control his mental and launch the MOSCON. Targets are New York, Los Angeles, Sydney, Rio de Janeiro, and Tokyo. 30 minutes to launch. Dr. Kirkland was found in the enemy's fleet. Stop MOSCON from launching. Allow Phoenix to move out. What? lt hasn't tested yet, are you sure? lf we don't use it now, we might not get the chance to fly it anymore. Geez. Understood! Move out now! l'm ready to fight! Ah! Hurry! We'll inform you when the detailed strategty has arrived. Before that, l've something to ask you. Why did you leave Jinpei behind? No. He was... Shut up, Jinpei. l'm asking Ken now. ls lriya more important than your comrades? l was just doing my job. Stop talking about duty! Jinpei would've died if l was late. Stop it! lt's my negligence. Alright? Don't forget that we are the chosen ones. The chosen ones. The chosen ones can only live the life that's chosen. You've never changed. Are you crazy? Am l crazy? Can't you be a bit normal? How can we be normal when we're like this? l don't know. l just want to live a normal life. But the stone has chosen us. And we're forced to wear those ugly uniform. We fought and killed the enemies and keep on fighting... But l feel happy sometimes. l guess l've gone crazy, too. Go take a rest. l can take care of here alone. George. Ken. Do you still remember? Captain's duty is not following the rules but to protect his comrades. Well, this is an order! Five of us, let's save the mankind together! Prepare to ascent! Energy loop open! Maximum power output! Using stone's assault weapons. l heard that the compatible parts for this body have been transplanted, too. We are a brand new siblings! System activated! Main engine has been opened! Main engine starts operating. Phoenix! Ready to move out. Yes! Tunnel has been opened. Attack command has been received. Request accepted. Target 1 to 5 have been locked. G-Catridge and rocket booster have been filled. l don't feel good about it. Relax. Shut up, Monkey. Shut up, Gorilla. 1 8 minutes to launch. Split after sneaking in! Stop MOSCON from launching. Enemy's orbital element diamater is 4,1 00 meters. Horizontal plane defense, approximately the fort's diameter, many of them. Affirmation confirmed. Ready to fight back. Missile preparation 80% to launch. Jinpei! Ryu! Ryu! Let's go! George! Jinpei! Jinpei! Ken! l'm fine! Let's go! 1 0 minutes left. Let's find Kirkland. Hurry! Understood. You don't have to remind me. Captain's duty is not following the rules but to protect his comrades. There you are. l'm not happy because you didn't return after borrowing it. Like you can defeat me with an attack like this. You want to take me away or you want to kill me? Wake up, Naomi! 7 minutes to launch. Here you are. Dr. Kirkland. What's this? How am l supposed to sneak in? What's this? l won't forgive you! Giving you freedom? So this is George's reply? l will not become a Galactor! Well, you should just kill yourself then! Can you see me, bastards? Ken! lt's been a while, Ken. What? You didn't tell him, huh? That's what friends are for, huh? l died because of Ken. But l've gained freedom. What is going on? Was it Naomi? lt has nothing to do with you. Come one! Of course it has! All safety locks have been unclocked. Hello, l'm Naomi. He's George, right? Nice to meet you. This sound... What...?! MOSCON is going to launch soon! Hurry, Jinpei! Well... Oh, yes. Connect to the control machine directly. Alright! How is it? lt's lighting up. Alright. New York is safe. Yes. Los Angelos is safe. Rio de Janeiro and Sydney are safe. Wanna know how we make it? Well, just move the satellite's orbit, using science technology and offset the orbit. l see. Ryu. Left only Tokyo now. This is for revenge... Get away from there, Jinpei. He's suicide. How's the situation? No! At the rate, l can't confirm it. Control has been cancelled. Damn it! Tokyo is late. Any other way to stop it? No other way but to destroy the satellite, huh? George? You must escape! George! MOSCON, leave the main fleet. Wanna date me, huh? l see. lt's over. Did you hear that, Ken? lt's unavoidable that Tokyo has become MOSCON's target. Dr. Nambu's evacution advisory is impossible to be fulfilled now. Ken. Brother! Go out! And George! They are battling in the satellite to stop MOSCON. We can't lose the five of them now. The rest depends on you now. Go out! What do we do, Brother? lt's going to launch soon. The three of you can do it! l'm going with George! No! l've finally realized that l want to be with George until the very end. This is the reason l'm fighting for. l'm proud that l can cook. lt tastes so bad. Jinpei. lndeed. Yeah. No, Ken! Come out now! Even to save the remaining four... l won't sacrifice anyone. Even to save thousands of people... l won't sacrifice anyone. And lastly, George, we, and Tokyo, all of us have come down. We've been released at last. Actually l really like you, George. That's why... l didn't kill you. Just kill me. The chosen ones will become Galactors. Kill me now. Leaving all the risky tasks to the chosen ones, while hiding youself at somewhere safe, why would you throw your life in for someone like that? Don't forget that you can gain the real freedom here once you've become Berg Katse. Got it? The chosen ones will become Galactors if they're infected with Virus X. Don't worry. As long as the stone is shining, they'll still protect us even though they were infected. But what if the light of the stone has faded? Until then... just kill him. l'll kill him, too. Stop it! Ken! Tell me! Are you Naomi? l'm the one that you love, Ken. The one that George has taken from you. And you want to kill me again. Naomi. Come with me, Ken. Let's be free together. No. You're not Naomi. Naomi died since a long time ago. She won't come back anymore. She's gone to Heaven. Fulfill your promise now, Ken. This has nothing to do with rules and duty. l fight because l want to protect mankind. l throw myself in because l want to save them. Naomi has saved me back there. Now, it's my turn to save you! Ken! So long, Naomi. Thank you. The last mission. Go! Go now! George! l want to die here. No! Get up! l've become a Galactor. The stone is still shining! We still have hopes! And you're my dearest friend. l won't let you die! You must live on in place of Naomi! You're so stupid... Haha! Yes! Stupid! Finally... Yes. Engine activated. Error occured! Engine cannot be activated! We can't get out! lt's still under testing. 1:30 minutes to launch. What do we do. The Bird Missile! Activate the missile! What are you doing? You're much clever than l thought. This is the only way. Change to battle mode, Ryu. Yes. l got it! Monitor Phoenix! Battle mode! Battle mode! Launch! 49%! Launch! 40 seconds to launch! There's still one more blow. What do we do? Launch again, Ryu! We'll be together forever. Right, Jun? The decision is in your hands! We'll just follow. Yes, me too! Okay. Alright. Let's go. lt's been concluded. Target corrected. Energy filled. Loading 60%. 5 seconds to launch. Launch! We did it! This is Kagaku Ninpo: Hinotori! Good job! Did you hear that, Jinpei? Ken said that he wants to be together with me forever. Of course l did. That's my brother. l mean we'll be together when we die. l didn't say that especially to Jun. Geez! Come on! lf it's like that, l'll steal your position as a Captain, and command you to date him out. You can't refuse, Ken. This is great. That's nonsense. They are the best! Yes. Let's go back. Roger!
