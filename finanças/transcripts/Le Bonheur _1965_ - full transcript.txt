HAPPINESS Go to sleep. Daddy's asleep. You mustn't make any noise. Did they wake you up? Maybe. Don't worry. Lovely weather. What a beautiful Sunday. They asleep? It's your day. - Again... - It's Father's Day all day long. What do you think of Mummy's dress? Beautiful, isn't it? Beautiful like Mummy! Come on, Gisou. Watch your feet. J. CHEVALIER - JOINER Wait. Say "Happy Father's Day!" to Daddy. Happy Father's Day to Daddy! Thank you, darling. She's funny. Don't you want to say something to me, monsieur? Like what? Anything, so long as you speak. You speak so well. Where were we? You were talking about the revolution of species. The evolution! What is the origin of organic life? "That is the question", as Hamlet said. Good evening. Hi, Uncle Joseph. - Had a good Sunday? - Yes. You? Great. Beautiful salads. Aren't they green? - Father's Day, eh? - Well, Uncle's Day too. Here they are. Good evening. These are for you. Keep them, my garden is full. Madeleine. Give me a kiss, eh? They're dirty and tired. - It was lovely weather. - Here too. I'd like a kiss, little man. He's not as affectionate as Gisou, and he's a boy. Stop, he'll talk back soon. Today he said "Madeleine" and "train". He did? Try "Hello, Aunt Madeleine". He's stubborn. We had a nice day. - We watched TV, had a short nap. - Happiness is, perhaps, - submission to the natural order. - Short? Until five. - Same for us. - You too? No, I went for a walk. I watched them sleeping. Well, everything's good, then. We have to get back for their bedtime. Let's go home, kids. Want the car back tonight? Don't bother. We'll stay at home. Tomorrow I'll go on the bus. That's nice of you. Take your flowers. Good night, little one. Good night, pussycat. - Good night, chicken. - Good night, Daddy. The countryside is beautiful. I don't know what I like more, the smell of the trees, the grass, or the river. It's ready! Let's go! - Already noon? - It's warm. Taken Joseph's lunchbox too? Of course, it's Monday. - The game was great! - I saw some of it on TV. - Just when Reims scored... - Great, but the referee was unfair. Lunch inside or outside? - Outside! - No, inside! - Heads or tails? - Heads. You win. Where's Pierrot? At the window with Ad?le. - He's visiting. - For sweets, of course! I want some too. Come, you'll get some. - Have you been good? - He's been adorable. - Hello, Mrs Chevalier. - Hello. - Getting married soon? - That's why we're here. Come in. Make yourself at home. We went to Paris on Saturday to find a ready-made dress. But she liked nothing. She isn't easy. No, but ready-to-wear doesn't fit me, and none of it was in fashion. I want a dress I saw in Elle, a dress with a short cape. So we hope you can do it. Yes. For when? Saturday of next week. It's short. A long gown, I mean. Yes, a short time, not the dress! Here's the sample. I didn't know how many metres. Here's the pattern. Right, let's measure you. - Will you wear heels? - Of course. Here's Daddy. Hello, horse. Hello, Dad. How are you? Do you have some sugar in your pocket? - To give to the horse. - Always. Your dad is here. - Hey, horse! ls it good? - You're here. Already here? What a welcome! Hello, ladies. I meant I was glad to see you early. That's how to speak to a husband. Oh, mademoiselle is getting married? Congratulations! Our Yvette is leaving Fontenay. I'm not going far. L'Hay-les-Roses. Still a suburb with roses. Better than Kremlin-Bic?tre. - Don't exaggerate. - Well, whatever. Getting married is the important thing. So, little man, what have you done all day long? - What is all day long? - It's a day. It's the sun, then. So why did you ask Pierrot what he'd done with the sun? Why don't you come to me? I'm coming. You put your foot in it. Her husband is buried in Kremlin-Bic?tre, in the Mercier mausoleum. See? I was right. Imagine a wedding in a mausoleum. You're silly. I'm hungry. We'll eat in five minutes. I'm going to Vincennes tomorrow. Several days' work in a new building. Is Uncle Joseph going too? He wants me to do it on my own. He wants to retire. Dad, give me some bread. As long as he takes care of the bills. Where's the post office, please? - There, on the right. - Thank you. Could I have 34 in Fontenay, please? Funny. I'm moving to the Fontenay post office soon. I'll just put you through. Booth 1. Fontenay 34? - Go ahead. - Joseph? It's me. There's a problem. They forgot about the chimney. They built it four days ago and the cupboard doesn't fit. Shall I sort it here, or bring it back? OK, I'll take new measurements. Consider it done. Finished? Not yet. La Roche? Put me through to Noirmoutier. So we'll see you soon? Early July. A MAN'S SOAP! It's worked out nicely. Annie's coming at half eight to baby-sit. We'll be able to make the nine o'clock show. I'd love it. Hope it's a Western. No, there aren't any horses. It's a French film, then. With Brigitte Bardot and Jeanne Moreau for the first time together. Which one do you prefer? As a woman. As a woman? You. I left early, but I'll catch up tomorrow. Come to the workshop, you two. Just like the ad for Nicolas Wines. Stop the music. John, some ros? for you as it's St John's Day. You're as good as gold. A real father for me. Get the glasses. I had to hurry from Vincennes not to miss this. Right on time. It certainly is time. Not for me, thanks. - Hey, it's a party! - A little toast to my health. Cigarette? Drinking and smoking. Who's got a light? Light a bonfire for St John. No, that's enough wood. Give this to Auntie. Thanks. Give this to Dad. - Did you make the forks? - Yes, I've got two. Wow, that's going to be good. No flames. Kebabs need coals. Is it enough to cook, Uncle? - Smoked meat is better. - Like cowboys eat. Indians eat the same. - Indians eat more spicy food. - With peppers? Red skin, red pepper! It's closed, he isn't here. I'll bring the car in, then. What is it? Blimey, it's a girl! It's a girl! - A girl, 3.10 kilos. - Born at two o'clock. 'The key is in the usual place. Please feed the kids. I'll be back at ten.' You've got a little sister. - I wanted a brother. - We have a niece at last. I'll close the gate so no one steals the kids. Why, are there kidnappers? No, I just want them to sleep quietly in the car. Gisou will be happy later. I hope we will too. What a beautiful bird. - Who is he? - It's Jean le Bon. Do think he was married to Anna la Bonne? Mademoiselle. Fontenay again? No, today a Paris number. Porte de Charenton, Diderot 5613. Mr Chevalier, please. It's his brother. Is that you? Well done! Yes, we're very happy. Isabelle? That's a nice name. No, I'm on an outside job. I want to send a telegram. For a happy event? I'm an uncle again. What does that come to? Nephews or the price? The price. I've got two nephews, a niece and two kids. Are the kids yours? It's 40 centimes. Cheap for a family. When will you be in Fontenay? Early July. It's coming quickly. I'm afraid I'll be a bit lost there. It's a nice place with roses. That's good then. Is a call to Tel-Aviv expensive? Very. - I'm not lunching with you today. - All right. I'll let you work. By the way, Where's the best coffee around here? At Le Ch?teau. Not Le Castel. What shall I do with my lunchbox? I can give it to the lions when I go past the zoo, or to the bears. Does your wife make honey? You could say that. She cooks well and she's nice. I could do with another one. Waiter! Two coffees. Does she work? Yes, she's a dressmaker. And you? Joiner. Can't you tell? Not from your face. Don't I smell of wood shavings? No, more like the countryside. That's good, I love the countryside. Don't you? I like it too. But also movies and dancing. I'm worried that Fontenay might be a bit dead. It's peaceful. TEMPTATION MYSTERY Why are you coming to Fontenay? I can get a new flat, a studio. Thanks to my brother. He's working in Abidjan. He's in the tyre business, and I'm in the wire business! He got me the flat, it's for him when he returns in two years. I prefer to live and work in the same place, so I requested a transfer and I got it. If I want to go out on Saturdays I can come back to Vincennes. You can go out dancing in Fontenay, and there are two cinemas. There aren't any big cafes like here, but there are roses. That would be a treat! You're the treat. How about a stroll? - Let's see the ch?teau. - Inside or outside? Inside. Outside. OK. I have to finish on site today so we can't be long. Since you're a joiner, could you put up some shelves and a cupboard for me? Sure I can. When? I'm moving on Saturday with my bed, my cases and my planks. I'll be there at two or three o'clock. It's the white building on the square. Paul Bert Avenue? Number four, entrance B, fifth floor on the right. My name's Emilie Savignac. Emilie, I love you. I mean, I'm happy to know you. Really. - Why "really"? - Nothing. You're unbelievable. Don't believe me. But I never lie. - Time to work. Shall we go? - Already? I still have time. I'll go and get some sun. I'll stay here. - Then I'll leave you. - Goodbye. - So, Saturday at four o'clock. - Remember the address? Entrance B, fifth floor, left. No, right. Goodbye. Goodbye, Emilie. I LOVE This fabric is nice but it's slippery. I can't get anywhere with it. - Now they want dresses for the girls. - They could have told you sooner! You know how it goes: at the last minute they thought of having little bridesmaids. - I worked hard today. - Me too. I finished in Vincennes. I got two bottles of wine as a tip. That's great! Painting this little garage is a long job. Leave it, you still have time. But hide it so Pierrot doesn't see it. Look. Pretty, isn't it? It's beautiful. Well, it Will be. Careful with the pins, and you'll cover it in paint! No paint on my fingers. There's some on your shirt. It doesn't matter. Don't argue with me or I'll spank you. I hope I can finish the dresses for Saturday. Don't wear yourself out. Say no for the little girls. I can't. They're nice, they've invited us. Saturday afternoon. It'll be fun, and I'll see how the gown looks. I can't go, I accepted a job. How sad. You go with the kids. I'll come later to get you. Let's go to bed. I feel like sleeping. Me too. Ad?le! Look at the bride! It was worth working so quickly. She looks wonderful. Very pretty. - It's beautiful. - It's worth seeing. See you this afternoon. Around three o'clock. But my husband is working. Will you lend me a picture to show him? Of course. - See you later. - You really did a good job. The bride is beautiful. Come over here. Gather together. Move back. Huddle together. OK. Smile. Gather together. Don't move. That's it. There... I love you too. I feel happy. Be happy too, don't worry. I'm free, happy, and you're not the first. Love me. Such happiness! Champagne! It's a must, for the baby. She's eight days old. Some champagne on her head! Empty your glasses! I'll get her. Stay here. I'll go. Empty your glasses. To the family! Can Isabelle drink some? Cheers! To Isabelle! To you, Fran?ois! It tickles. Do you want cherries? - Look at my earrings. - They're very nice. The baby's drinking. Little one, give me a smile. Look at me. Are you quiet? Asleep? Auntie, come and see the cabin. That's nice. Is it a doll's house for Isabelle? No, it's a trapper cabin for Robert and me. - No girls allowed. - Not even me? You can do anything you like, except carry this one everywhere. - He's so small. - He has to walk. - I'm taking a quick break. - Don't worry, there's no hurry. It's so wonderful to be all together. - But where's Gisou? - Glued to the cot. You know she asked me for a little sister? I'd like a lot of children but I think we should wait. I think so too. I don't want you to be exhausted, we need our time to rest together. Is this resting together? That too. I'm here for the cupboard. I was wondering if you'd come back. Seriously, I came to do your shelves. You can't leave it as it is. Is that true? See? I want the cupboard against the wall, with that screwed on top, and a shelf higher up. That won't stay up like that. I'll screw this box first. Don't stay there. I like you too much. Sit over there while I work. I need some more wood to do it. Finished already? For now, yes. I'll finish in the next few days. Can I come closer? If you need help with anything else, just say. Maybe a board and two trestles. - You came back. - You thought I wouldn't? - You didn't say anything. - Couldn't you feel it? I was afraid you'd say first time it's new, a surprise, second time it's a habit. Every day is a new day. Are you happy at home too? Very happy. Your wife is not a habit? No. I love her very much. We get along, we have fun. And we have our kids. We get surprises every morning. - And me? - I met you and I love you. POSTWOMAN TERRIBLY TEMPTING PENSIVE TENDER THOUGHTS PASSIONATE TIME TOGETHER YOUR FRAN?OIS You have to do it differently, sir. I'll show you. There. You're good at that. So are you. Have you ever been happy with a man? Yes, once. For three months. Then he left me, he disappeared. Then I waited for another happiness. When you know, you're patient. Were you sad? Not terribly. I don't like sadness. I was... How shall I put it? Slightly distant. Now I'm here. I'm myself, I mean. I like that about you. And it's the same for me. I can't say... that I'm a different man since I met you. On the contrary, I'm even more myself. You know, I met my wife when I was doing military service in Ch?lons. It was love at first sight. We married when I got out. Had I known you first, I'd be living with you. Sleeping together is fine when you're in love. But I met her first. I married her... and I love her. She gave me joy. And now I meet you. You please me too, I love you too. I have enough joy for both of you. Happiness works by addition. You may like having two wives. Yes, maybe. But I didn't look for it. We won't be able to see each other often. But when we're together it'll be good... and apart we can think about it. We are together. When I imagine you with your wife it's rather unpleasant. You know I love her. I can't lie to you. It's not my fault if you came afterwards. That's the way it is. Just think about how lucky we are to know each other. - And be alive. - That's true. - I love you. - Me too. Tell me one thing. Are she and I the same to you? No, very different. You make love better, you have more fun. You're full of invention. It's like a new wine for me. My head is spinning and I know your pleasure is in your heart too. Like with Th?r?se. She likes lovemaking too but she's calmer. I'm the one who leads, and she likes that. I like that about her. She likes me to have fun with her. She's tender, always there and our children look like her. You see, I'm being honest. Yes. It's good. You taught me another game. We're more alike. Th?r?se is like a hardy plant. You're like an animal set free. I love nature. Quite a speech! Do you understand? I understand French and Fran?ois. INSURANCE TRUST Some people look bored on Sundays. They prefer the factory. They must look the same on weekdays. A new client came yesterday. She was ugly and fat and mean-looking. You should have said you were too busy. That's what I said. I saw myself sadly sewing for her and I could see you pricking her to deflate her. I was afraid, so I said no. You're wonderful, always doing what I'd like you to do. Except for chocolate rice pudding. We can't have it every day. What I love, I can have every day. Radishes, fried potatoes, chocolate rice pudding. And you as a second dessert. You already have me every day. Meals shouldn't be the same. She wasn't dancing, she was dreaming. - She's in love. - I am. With one of us? No. I would have told you. Who, then? I'm not saying. You know me, I don't like mysteries, but love is secret. Even her heart is hidden. No, it just doesn't match any brooch. Will we meet him? No. It's different. I like going out with you. Nothing more. She'll tell me. At least let's dance. Hasn't Isabelle changed? She's bigger and very cute. Auntie is mad about her. She'll love her as much as Gisou. Daughters and dolls... Hi, boss. I love dolls too. On Saturday I met one. She was like Dalida, minus the accent. - You're a real skirt-chaser. - That's why I keep my hair slick. You could use a guitar. In romance, I can sing duets. As long as I can change my partner. I'd rather have just one, a good one. You say that because you're young. After you get one, you'll want them all. Unless you're like Fran?ois. He doesn't look unhappy. I like fidelity. The same woman, your whole life? Your wife's wonderful, though. But all your life with the same woman... That's not what I mean. I'm not impulsive. When I love, I can't stop. Come on, boys. You're young, OK, but it's Monday. How about some work? You have to earn your pension. For old people, I feel the same. I loved my father. I don't think of him very often, but I love him. He's here. It goes on. There are lots of people here. In such a big place, I feel less alone. - I go back to work at one. - Me too. Let's just see if this is real. - Is it the same if I pinch you? - Not exactly. Do you really love me? What? You said "love". It's true even when I'm asleep. What time is it? Nine. It's a lovely day. The kids have had breakfast. Come and kiss me since there's no coffee. - Do you want a kiss or some coffee? - Everything. You're lucky, it's ready. Daddy, Mummy, are we going to the country? Fran?ois, come and drink your coffee. Some sugar. And your teaspoon. Gisou, you're under my feet. Please move. Go and play back there. - They're sleepy. I'll put them to bed. - Wait. Isn't this nice? This really is the best spot. - When I think about winter... - Don't. Actually, I wasn't. I feel very happy. You look happy these days. Even more than usual. - Does it show? - Yes. What is it? Summer? Come on, babies, nap time. Time for bed. What's making you so happy, then? It's more happiness. It's hard to explain. I'm scared you won't understand. - Sharing it might hurt you. - Hurt? You're right, I'm clumsy. Talk to me. No. Forget it. I can understand. I'm not stupid. My love, that's not what I mean. I don't like lying. - Are you sad? - I don't know. I'm listening. Don't be sad. It's simple. You and I and the kids, we're like an apple orchard, a square field. Then I notice an apple tree that grows outside the field and blooms with us. More flowers, more apples. It adds up. Do you understand? I think so. ls there somebody who loves you like I do? Not like you. Are you in love too? Yes. It just happened. And it gave me such joy. How long have I not been alone with you? A month. You shouldn't talk like that. Am I different with you? Less kind? Less loving? But you're the only one I love. I'm your wife. I love you. Look at me. I love you. It's like if I had ten arms to hug you and you ten arms for me. We're all mixed together. But I found myself with extra arms. - I'm taking nothing from you, see? - And she's not jealous? She knows I love you. She doesn't want to take anything. You don't want to live with her? Of course not. Do you understand? It's difficult. It's so new. If it hurts you, I'll do what you want. If you ask me to do without her, I'll do it. I want you to be happy. You and the kids. You and me. You first. You know, it's silly to miss out on more life and love. If you could love me the same, even more if you wish. Maybe. Yes, I think I could. You could? - How much do you love me? - More, since it makes you so happy. My love! Imagine if we could make a blanket of grass, or walls of leaves. That way we would be alone together. Mummy, I've slept enough. I'm not sleepy any more. Where's Mummy? In the woods? - I don't know. I've just woken up. - Let's go and look. Excuse me. You wouldn't have seen a blonde woman in a blue dress? I wasn't paying attention. Have you seen a blonde woman in blue? A young woman, yes. A blue dress with some yellow in it? - That's it. - One went that way, holding flowers. Come on! - A young blonde lady? - What? A blue and yellow dress. A blue and yellow dress. What? What do you want? Look. What's happening there? She drowned herself. Do you think she's dead? We brought her ashore, we tried to resuscitate her... Fran?ois can't keep them, for now. How would he? We... I'm able to raise my daughter's children. In Ch?lons? You live too far away, it's not possible. We could do it too, couldn't we, Madeleine? Of course. You're like a son to us. It's easier if they come to us. Three or five, same difference. They know each other. We love them already. If I take Gisou, you the boy... We can't separate them! It's not that we don't want Gisou. Uncle is right. If Fran?ois agrees, we'll take them both. I'll be able to see them on Sundays. Even during the week. Every evening if I want. You understand, they are my children. I know. It's terrible. I'm going away with the kids at the start of August. - Who are they with? - My brother and his wife. We'll go to the Loire. - And you? - I'll come back. I start work again in September. And you? I'm here. I'm happy and unhappy. Say, do you think we can put the radio on? - Can I put the radio on? - Of course. You! You bought a table. And a record player. I thought about you a lot. It was a long summer for me. Me too, I thought about you. I still want to be happy. If you're willing. One thing I'm afraid of is to take someone else's place. I loved you both. I miss Th?r?se very much and I love you. That's not all. The kids. I'd like you to love them. I saw them. They're cute. - Maybe you don't want to marry. - That doesn't matter. You're my happiness. You and your life. I want you, but not at night here. Can I come tomorrow after work? I'll be here at six o'clock. It will still be light. What about Sunday? We'll go to the forest if you want. Emilie, Daddy, I've brought some sticks. Thank you, Gisou. Is your little fish OK? I'll let you tame them. I'm going for a walk.
