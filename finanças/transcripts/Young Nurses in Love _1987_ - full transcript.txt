We're behind in medical research, the space race, the nuclear race. We're in trouble. Our newly appointed 30-year-plan calls for us to surpass the U.S. of A. in all these fields. To do this, we must develop our own genius. America-- our only hope. We spent a lot of money on you, Dr. Reilly. - We expect results. - Well, you can count on me, Mr. Brock. I want those government grants. You know, it's a shame our country won't know the sacrifice I'm making for them. But you know it really doesn't matter. After all, when my work is completed, my name will be known around the world. - I can wait till then. - Let me warn you, Dr. Reilly, your arrogant attitude doesn't play a part in this mission. Just drop it. If you don't succeed, you're gonna find yourself in some podunk practicing medicine on chickens. Hoover General Hospital. Somewhere behind these walls is the world's foremost sperm bank. Frozen for all these years is the semen of the Earth's greatest minds. Your mission, Comrade "Dasbrowski," is to steal that sperm. - Too bad she's one of theirs. - Yeah, sure is a shame. I'd love to debrief her. ( laughs ) Do whatever you have to do, Dr. Reilly, but remember, she's gotta be caught red-handed. That's the only way we can convict her. This will be your disguise. You'll be known in America as Nurse Ellis Smith. You'll communicate with me using this state-of-the-art transmitter/receiver. - Very ingenious. - Very expensive. This object is known in America as a "cooler." You will be supplied with one that has a false bottom equipped with a special freezing generator in which to hide and keep frozen our future. Remember, it must remain frozen. - Any questions, Doctor? - Are there any questions? Good. ( snaps fingers ) Comrade Dabrowski... ( snaps fingers ) you must succeed, even if it costs you your virginity. I'll expect reports from you around the clock. Don't fuck up. Your future depends on a successful mission.
