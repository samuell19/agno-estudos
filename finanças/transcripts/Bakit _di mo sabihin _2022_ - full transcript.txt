Hey, Migs! Nice to see you home! Let me give you a ride. I'll go ahead. Daddy's here! Daddy! I'll race you! Daddy! I'll race you! Daddy! Daddy, do you have a present for me? Daddy, why is mom not with you? Mom has so much work to do. So much work. - But why... - Dad, look at my drawing. Look Dad! Isn't it great? It doesn't look good. Mine is better. It's beautiful. Right? I have a lot more inside. You want to see? Let's go! Daddy, look! I'm just going to change my clothes. Okay. You're it! That's not fair! You're it! Angelo, get some water. Tina, come here. Sit down. What's for dinner? Sinigang and the leftover Menudo. Oh... The one that Aunt Becky cooked? It doesn't taste great. But... edible. He said it tastes awful! I'm going to tell Aunt Becky! Mom's cooking is way better. Mom's spaghetti is better! Mom's Afritada is my favorite! Mom's Adobo is my favorite. Well, I'm mom's favorite. Come back here! Gelo! Come back here! Yeah, she cooks great. Only when she has the time to cook. So what? But are you sure? You may be rushing this. It will be hard for the kids not having a complete family. They're used to it. They know you have to work in Manila. Like OFW's. Like that. But this… Wait! I'm just going to get another drink. He's cute! He's cute! Bitch! I know you're married. I meant bring cutie here for me. Let's smoke. How are you? I know you. How are you guys? Really? Same. When it's good, it's good. When it's bad, it's bad. Is it supposed to be this hard? I don't think I'm the right person to answer that. Do you see a ring? None right? I'm single. I can't answer that! It's not supposed to be that sad. Sad? I'm not sad. Really? Really? Yeah! Well, I'm pissed. What's his problem? Look at you, you're married! He's so lucky to have you! Girl, what's your problem? So many guys would die to have you. Right? Twelve fucking years. I really thought that you guys were perfect for each other. You stink! You smoked again. I asked you to go out with me. It's not my crowd. Where are you? At work. I told you yesterday that I have a meeting today. It's Saturday. We planned to have dinner later. I'll meet you. Let me know where. Waiting. What? Let's sleep. I'm tired. I'm tired too! I'm tired of all of this! What do you want? I feel like I don't have a wife anymore. I'm giving you all of me! Is that it? It's lame! Everything good? I'm going there. Okay? Thank you. Are you okay? Our friends are just starting to get married. I'm already getting separated. And so? I don't even have a boyfriend. I'm tired. You deserve an award! Miss Patience! True! It was a very long time! He was patient too. But I never pretended to be someone else. I'm not even someone he likes. But he tried. Well, he had an illusion of you. Or, of who he wanted you to be. Fuck! Sit down. Sit down. So many people work so hard, trying to find a way to love who they are. Me? I love who I am! Migs makes me feel that's so wrong. Mimi, do you have gin? Can you get some please? I'll go check the pantry. Thank you. Wake up! Hurry up! Wake up! Wake up! You didn't shower! You stink! But I took a bath! Last night. I smell fine. You smell good. You're taking so long, Gelo! I'm ready! Did you wash your hands? Yes. Dad! Miss Vargas said they're going to print the poem I wrote in the school paper. Wow! Why do you use sign language with dad? You know he can hear. He just can't speak. Stop annoying your big brother. Go eat. Because I want to! But why? I don't want to be out of practice. I still want to be fluent when mom gets here. Do you still know how to sign? I still know how to sign, Mister Grouch! Hurry up. Hurry up. We're going to be late for school. Bye daddy! Hey! Be good. Behave. Okay. Okay. I'll try. Crazy. Let's go. Dad! Always! Always! Always, always! Always, always! Dad! Always, always! Big brother! Good morning! Good morning! You may take your seats. I'm Migs! This is my sign name. I am your teacher. Yeah? Yeah. You have to introduce yourselves, one by one. Yes. My name is Raymond. This is my sign name. Applause. My name is Mary Anne. This is my sign name. Thank you! My name is Inea. This is my sign name. Applause. Jacob. Abegail. Aerish. Princess. Mervin. His house? It's over there. His house? It's over there. May I know who you are? I am teacher Migs. Ryan's teacher. Elena. He was absent today. I can hear a little. But I can't speak. I can hear a little. But I cannot speak. You are lucky you can hear a little. Unlike Ryan, he is both mute and deaf. Sorry I came here without notice. May I ask, why Ryan is absent? Oh no, that's a mistake. He really can't go to school. There was a staff from census who came here. When he found out that Ryan cannot speak and hear, he said Ryan should go to school. But I don't have money for that. I am teacher Migs. He can't understand sign language. No one here knows how. I'll teach him how to do sign language and English. I am really sorry. I need Ryan here in the fields. He cannot go to school. He is so young. When I was his age, I was already working. We are just poor. With pile of debt. Until I get to pay all these debts I will not be able to send him to school. Clear? What is proper fraction? Study it well. Isn't that mixed number fraction? Look! Mom is here! Come on! Mommy! How are you? There is a nearby pizza store there. Let's eat! Let's go there and eat. Again, slower. There is a nearby pizza store there. Let's eat! Nat! Nat! Nat! Nat! Come inside and take a rest. We are going out with mom. Later. Come on, take a rest. Why don't you rest inside? Your mom would think I'm not feeding you well. You just had a meal. Dad, come with us. Come! Let's go! Look! I designed that logo! And the whole poster! And soon the video I edited will be online. Wow! Cool! Have you met the artist? Yes! She's beautiful. Like us. Stand beside the poster. I'll take a photo of you. Mommy, make it pretty. I'll show this to my friends. Mommy, do her pose. Is that okay? Pretty enough? Beautiful. Hey! It will be easier for us to update each other. How come you still don't have Facebook? I don't want Facebook. I'll just get envious of my friends. Some of them are fake, posers. How old are you again? He is so grumpy, mom. Like a grandpa. Grandpa! Grandpa Gelo! You act like a two-year old. Let's eat. What do you guys want to eat? You know what Tina. Let's have mom decide on where to eat. She's not always with us. What do you guys want? She'll pick rice cake, again. I have to go. Mom, sleep beside me. Please. Sorry. I'm gonna miss you. Okay? Hold on. So you don't have to worry about this on Christmas, and you can enjoy your holiday. Okay? Come on now! You may go home. Bye. Bye. Why haven't you gone home? I want to ask you something. What? Why are you and mom separated? I know you guys always fight. It's so loud when you fight. It's not that easy. I thought if it's just the two of you in Manila. No more fighting. That everything will be okay. That's why even if it is sad, I thought to myself that it's okay. Why did you leave mom in Manila? We need to think, separately. After thinking, are you guys going back together? Is that what you want? Migs! Migs! Where's your nanny, Angelo? She's gone. Gone? Did you eat? Tina? Yes? Where is your mom? She is not here. She went away too? Your dad? Yes. What is this? Oh my, there's piss on the floor. What the heck? Where's the rug? Underneath! Here! We shouldn't have trusted that nanny, she ignored our kids. And your sister does not have the right to take away my kids. You know that we both do not have time for them. This is just temporary. I told you to stop working. We both need to earn. You know this. Yes, I know that you are earning bigger than me. No, that's not what I mean. I was just explaining. It is better for the kids to be there so, Nancy can take care of them. Both of us do not have time. How dare you decide on your own. They are my children too. My children. I am the teacher. I know that your intentions are good but you don't understand. We do not have money. Please leave. Too bad, the kid is missing an opportunity. Wow. Seems like you are doing okay there. Looks like you already found something to get busy with. And it seems like you have a new project. What project? Seems like you are fixing someone. You are so obsessed on fixing other people. That's an overstatement. I am just supportive. By the way, you done with your thesis? You should continue finishing it. Don't waste your master's degree. What do you need? I'll help you. See? Obsessed. But you know what, you don't have to fix everything. Sometimes, you just have to let it be. Okay. I still have to do something. Just update me on… Bye. Eat a lot, guys! Thank you! Come on, have a feast. What's up? How's the food you're eating? It's delicious. You are so fast in preparing all of this. Migs, if you already have eight children. Preparing for a party would seem like a hobby. Come, let's check out my gifts. Little girl! Don't open the gifts. I still have to take a photo of those. Okay mom. Cute! You and Nat should make another baby. Tina is already growing up, anyway. Oh no, that's hopeless. They're already separated, right? The kids might hear you. They are far, I checked. Who knows they might be back together again. Right, Migs? That's impossible. He already learned. That will never happen again. This kind of talk needs another round of drink. Migs, I'll be back. I'll just get some beer. Why am I getting a small share? What can I do? That is just how much we earned. Is this because I am in Manila? It's as if you are not aware. Life is so hard. Rice is being sold at low prices. But then there is so much expenses. We almost have no profit. I have to borrow money. Don't act as if you are being taken advantage of. We are the one who are left here to work. And you, you are just waiting. What? Eat. No, thanks. So much stuff going on in your head! Well, why? All he thinks about is himself. We have visitors. I don't care. Do you think we need to bring him to a doctor? Look at him. I think he doesn't speak yet because nobody speaks in this house. I think we should bring him to school So he can be around kids he can talk to. Hey! Let's have another baby. Sure, you can have my womb. You don't know how it is to have siblings. It's hard to take care of kids. We're both working. Hey, better if you stop working So we don't have to depend on a nanny. You know my work is important to me. Work is important to you but your family is not? Wait, work and family, I can do both. I am okay. We are both okay. But how did Ryan get the scholarship? We didn't apply. With all due respect, why are you so insistent? Why are you not happy? I already explained that to you. You just don't want to understand. Apart from not having money for Ryan's school, I also need him in the fields. And also, he is okay with this life. Don't confuse him and give him hopes that something good will happen to him. You don't want his life to get better? We have a roof over our head, rent free. While there's a demand for rice, we will have work. But… With education, he will have a voice. If he studies, will there be a change? Do you think he can get a decent job? He will just end up here in the fields. Look, we are living a good life. All that abundance is just for today. Tomorrow, it's gone. It seems like we are already insulting each other, leave us alone! Sis, can you call on Ryan? He needs to buy more beer. How are you? Are you sure this is what you want? If you want to get separated, it's okay. But we have to talk about the kids. Please. Talk to me. What? Please. Talk to me. What? This relationship is toxic. Yes, it is. Because of you. Because you don't want to talk to me. What? Why are you so stubborn? You refuse to listen. Are you doing this to spite me? I gave you everything! Not everyone like you has the opportunities that I am giving you. And then what? The two of you will live together? You both have nothing! Leave! Leave! Come home. Let's go home. I will not go with you, I am staying here. Leave! Don't you want to fix it with your mom? Have you met my mother? She thinks she can control my life. She's also like that with dad. That is why they separated. He left us because of mom's attitude. Maybe she is just like that, but she loves you. I don't want that kind of love. It's painful. Maybe when you become a mother, you will understand her. I will never be like her. You, to be honest... You and her... You guys look alike. Yes! You look alike. No! Tina! You always leave your toys all over the place. It seems like you have a father here even if I was not around. He is just acting like a dad. And you are acting like a baby. You're so unruly. I am not unruly. You just have so many rules. You really are such a fighter, Tina. Just like your mom. Be careful little girl. You might end up just like your mom. You might lose a husband in the future. That's okay, Auntie Becky. Mom is my idol. When will mom arrive? Does she know that it's our Christmas break starting tomorrow? We haven't discussed it yet. I'll go ahead. My family is probably hungry. Wait! What? It's just a simple party? Hi guys, this is Migs! Hi! I am Disney. Nice to meet you! Smile. This is better. It's just the two of us. What? Why did you choose to date me? Why did you say "yes"? Fishing, but game. You're kind. Caring. And very stupportive. Yes! I can only give you moral support. And that's all I need. I love you. Always. Always, always! What's that? Are you drunk? Of course not! Wait. This is normal “always”. But this… Is “always, always”. You're just inventing that. Let's runaway. I was the one who first thought of calling mom. I should go first. But it always takes you so long. I'm faster. No fighting! She's so unruly. She couldn't wait. Hey Nat! I'll go to bed now. Bye! Bye! He is such a bully. He always wants to be in control. Mommy, I am part of the nativity play in the church. Wow! No more stage fright. I'm trying. [applause] It's your turn. Always, always. Kisses. Love you! I love you! Always, always. Okay! Take care. I'll send the video of my dance. I'm so good. It's in dad's phone. I'll just borrow it from him later. That's all. I told you I'd be quick! Okay! Stop fighting. I love you so much. Take care. Good night. Always, always! Kiss! Always, always! Kiss! Are you okay? I'm okay. Your son just keeps somersaulting. Look. I am also trying to make my own designs. I'll show them to Aunt Fely tomorrow. But she might not approve. She's just helping me, I don't want to appear demanding. Hey! Don't laugh! I can't not do anything anymore. I'm going crazy. Maybe, it's a good idea for you to get a freelance job? I already tried. No opening yet. And the ones I see online keep requiring artists to attend meetings. We have emails now. I don't get it. I don't get it. Do you want to go back to Manila? Seriously? Are you okay? Let's go there! What is it that you want? You to be a responsible wife. You mean everything I've done for us means nothing to you? What did you do for us? I left my family because of you! I chose you! That was your decision. You wanted to live in Baler. I followed you. Don't blame me for that. I gave up my life here. We came back from Baler. I followed you! I allowed you. I wanted to work. But you don't want me to. I followed you. And you kept asking me to quit! I think you totally regret moving back here, and letting me work. I didn't know that you'll be like that. Become what? You always put yourself first. There's nothing wrong with loving myself. We should be your priority. You're my wife. You are a mother. You have to give up your job so you can take care of our kids. We are a couple! We should be helping each other. Show us that your family is important to you! How? How? How will I when you've taken them away from me? Now we have a chance to be good parents. What have you done? We lost our first child because maybe we were never ready. Now we have this chance to prove to ourselves that we both can be good parents. That we can have a good family. How dare you say that! You were with me. The whole time. You know how much pain I was in. We were both in pain. Now we have Tina and Angelo. This is our chance! Is it really me that you love? I don't have any affairs. No, that's not what I mean. Do you love the person that I have become? You changed. I don't know you anymore. This is still me. I just grew up. Do you still want me? Then why stay? I am sorry... What is it? Aren't you missing mom? Why? Because I am missing her so much. How about you? You should be missing her too. But I am not forcing you to miss her. Maybe it's better for you to be apart. Why do you say that? It is not really okay. It's better than you guys being together, but not happy. What's important is, I love the both of you. Pretty? Very pretty. Not me. The wall! Sorry, I got confused. Of course, it's pretty. I am proud of my wife. She paints good. What do you want to eat? Sorry! I was so absorbed painting! I forgot the time! That's okay. I'll cook for us. That's okay. Thank you! Well, we really should share chores. We should also share the home expenses. That way, we can both save. Okay. Delicious! Wow! Sorry it took me so long to save up. That's why my wedding gift is delayed. I don't mind not getting a gift. Oh! I have an idea of the gift that I want. What? We waited so long. I just wanted to make sure that we are ready. Sorry. I am so stupid. Are you sure? I know you were so much in pain when… I like that Christmas lantern. It's beautiful. Here you go again, always asking dad to buy stuff. Can you even eat that? It's Christmas! Why? What's important is you get to eat what you buy. Daddy, did mom text you? Did she greet you “Happy Anniversary”? Is she nearby now? What do you mean “is she nearby now”? If she's already nearby... Your arrival is around this time when you travel from Manila. Stop pestering dad. Didn't mom tell us she can't come? We'll be staying here for Christmas. And we'll go to Manila for the New Year to be with mom. Such a brat. She messaged me last night. I was able to read it just this morning. She's already on her way. Your mom travelled during Christmas eve? Yes. She apologized for not making it to the Christmas Eve dinner. But she's on her way to be with us for Christmas. Ew! I don't want to be like that when I grow up. Like that? I don't want a boyfriend. Or maybe I will not choose to marry. No comment. Why is that? I don't want to get separted. Just like you and mom. We're different. Some of my classmates' parents are also getting separated. They always fight because they don't understand each other. Why can't they understand each other? Arguing is normal. Sometimes, people can't really understand each other. How come? In my age, I understand Tagalog, English and Filipino Sign Language [FSL]. Maybe I can speak Korean one day. Daddy, what is it that you wanted to say that mom couldn't understand? I am still not ready to tell her. Why don't you tell her? Waiting. I think I'm almost near. See you baby. Merry Christmas! Happy anniversary! I'm sorry Three died, six wounded in an accident when the van fell off the ravine along Capili Road, Pantabangan, Nueva Ecija. Based on the investigation, the van lost control of its break while passing through the steep road. Until the van fell off the ravine. The passengers are on their way to Baler. Wounded passengers are recovering in the hospital. The operator of the van is yet to give his comments. Dad, let's go! Give me a moment. I just need to tell your mom something. - Where are we going? - What are we doing later? Hey! Hey! What's up? What's our plan later? Let's play billards. Come on. Okay, sure. Who's that? I know that look in your eyes. It doesn't mean that you don't teach here, you can already date our students. That's prohibited. She's just 18. Why? What's wrong? He is just looking. Besides, Nat is not his type. He is too old school. Am I right Grandpa Migs? Why? Is it not possible for me to change? Right. Right.
