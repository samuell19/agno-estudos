[KEYBOARDS CLICKlNG] [GASPS] Any progress, Eric? I'm sorry, Professor Kaufman. There's still something wrong with the program. Well, we can't do any more experiments with the laser until you boys fix it. We know, we know. Hey, wait. I found something. [GASPS] -What? -Who turned on the laser? ERlC & BILL: Not me! -Shut it down! -I can't. It's not responding. [ELECTRICY CRACKLING] [ALL GASP] [CACKLING] KAUFMAN: What is that? BILL: I was hoping you'd know, professor. [BOTH GASP] [GASPS] Look, he's absorbing all our computer data. Call security! [YELLS] [BILL & KAUFMAN GASP] [ALL GRUNTING] [PHANTOM VIRUS CACKLING] SHAGGY: Like, are we there yet, Fred? FRED: I toId you, Shaggy, soon. SHAGGY: But you said that an hour ago, man. It's so impressive that Eric received a grant for his computer project. It doesn't surprise me. In high school, he practically lived in the computer lab. Right, Velma? Yup, he's one smart cookie. [GAME BEEPING] Cookie? Cookie?! -Sorry, Scooby. Figure of speech. -Aww. Cheer up, Scoob. When we get there, we get to play the computer game Eric designed. I bet it's way cooler than this one. Yeah, cooler. Imagine a computer game starring aIl of us. Solving mysteries in cyberspace. Like, l hope I do better on Eric's game than this one. [ALL LAUGHING] [STUDENTS CHATTERING] WEMBLEY: Hey! Where do you think you're going? To visit our friend Eric Staufer. He's a student here. Not if you're not on my list. It should be under "Fred Jones." -Is this whole group with you? -Yes, sir. Including the dog? Dog? Where? Hmm. Ah, there you are. But just so you know... ...l don't like a bunch of punks running around my university. -Your university? -It might as well be. I've been here for 20 years and there's never been any trouble on my watch. [SCOOBY MOUTHlNG] I'm the head of security. Wembley's the name. [SNlCKERING] -Twenty years is an impressive record. -You bet it is. And I wanna make sure that it stays-- [GIGGLES] Oh, a wise guy, eh? I'm keeping a special eye on you, pooch. Pooch? -Like, Scooby's just playing, officer. -Yeah, sorry. We just need some help finding the computer lab. The lab is three buildings down on the left. -Thanks. -And keep your dog off the grass. Huh? Bah. Wow, Eric, this lab is one groovy setup. Yeah. We like it too. SHAGGY: Zoinks! SCOOBY: Wow! BILL: You don't wanna eat those. SHAGGY & SCOOBY: Huh? Because they're grown in radioactive soil. SHAGGY: Zoinks! -This is my lab partner, Bill McLemore. -Nice to meet you. Thanks for keeping Shaggy and Scooby from glowing in the dark. We'll go to dinner after the tour. But first, can you show us your new video game? Scoob and I have been dying to play it. No one is playing the game until we get rid of our problem. Professor Kaufman, I'd like you to meet the mystery gang l based my game on. -Hi! -Oh, hi. Nice to meet you. Ah! The famous Mystery, Inc. SHAGGY: And that's Scooby-Doo. [GIGGLING] Ahem. Yes. Well.... It looks like you showed up just in time for a mystery. -A mystery? -Why? What happened? This is a hyper-energy Iaser. We've been using it... ...to break down actuaI objects and project them into cyberspace. Jinkies! You mean you can transport objects from the real world into the computer world? -Precisely, young lady. DAPHNE: That's fantastic. It was, until the laser beamed a monster into our world last night. -A monster? -A monster? Yes, the laser beamed a computer virus right here into this lab. A really freaky-looking thing. ERlC: He wiped out all the data from our computers by just walking near them. This virus is also abIe to control and manipulate electrical objects. -But where did it come from? -Eric's computer game. Computer viruses don't just appear. They have to be created by someone. But l didn't create it! I'm sure it wasn't Mr. Staufer here. But whoever created this virus is in serious troubIe. Our civilization is so dependent on technology... ...that this virus is a threat to the entire world. Can you show us how this laser works? You can show them the demo, but don't start the game. Yes, sir. [BEEPlNG] Like, check it out, ha-ha, we're digital. Yeah, digital. Hee-hee-hee! We used the game to extrapolate 3-D data into quantum particIes. From there, it's child's play to reintegrate the molecular structure in virtual space. -Of course. It's so simple. ALL: It is? He used the Scooby game as the location in cyberspace to store physical objects. And you're sure the virus came from the game? Unfortunately, yes. Well, there's no virus in my baseball game, and it's more entertaining. [ORGAN PLAYING IN GAME] ANNOUNCER: Batter up. Strike one. [CROWD CHEERING] Now, this is a game you can get into. That's really cool, Bill. I'm a huge baseball fan myself. You have good taste, Fred. I think it's the greatest sport in the world. BasebalI's okay... -...but it doesn't have Scooby and me in it. -That's right. The Scooby game has 1 0 levels. You need to battle monsters or vilIains... ...whiIe trying to find a box of Scooby Snacks on each level. Oh, boy. Scooby Snacks! Okay, professor. ALL: Ohh! Now, check out the monitor. FRED: Cool! VELMA: Jinkies! I wouldn't believe it if I didn't see it with my own eyes. Like, l don't believe it either. We didn't even get one Scooby Snack. [SIGHS] Yeah. Eric and Bill are sure to win the quarter-million-dollar grand prize... ...at the internationaI science fair. Wow, that's some prize. It will be a reward for all their talent and hard work on the laser project. We couldn't have done this without you, professor. You should share in the reward. No, no, no. As a teacher, being able to guide young minds... ...to their fuIl potential is reward enough, Eric. Like, speaking of rewards... ...is it possibIe to get the Scooby Snacks out of the game? -Groovy! -Oh, boy! DAPHNE: Oh! -Hey, that's mine! -No, mine! Mine! Is that the way the virus came out of the game, Eric? Yeah. It was pretty scary. If it's just a computer virus, what harm can it do in the real world? From what we observed last night, this virus has the potentiaI... ...to steal every computer program in the worId. And the virus made a telephone come to life, which attacked Eric. [BOTH GASP] BILL: It kept coming toward us and we couldn't stop it. [ELECTRICITY CRACKLlNG] [CACKLING] KAUFMAN: Then I held up a magnetic bar in defense. [PHANTOM VIRUS YELLS] It seemed to have an adverse effect on the virus. [YELLING] BILL: Yeah, and it seemed like the magnet weakened him. Like Kryptonite to Superman. -Wow! -Creepy! The security guards checked the campus, but couldn't find him anywhere. I suspect that he is still in this building somewhere. -StilI here? -StilI here? [BOTH GULP] No more arguing, boys. -Huh? -Huh? So, what can we do to help, Eric? Well, if you can lure the Phantom Virus into the lab... ...l can use the laser to beam him back into cyberspace. Oh, great. Like, you want us to be virus bait? Like, no way, man. Uh-uh. Would you do it for a Scooby Snack? -Yeah, yeah. -HoId on, Scoob. Only one Scooby Snack to go chase a phantom? I don't think so. What if I gave you each two Scooby Snacks? SHAGGY: Hm? Okay, you got a deaI. Go long, guys. This place is so big, we'll probably never see this virus anyway. Yeah. Hee-hee-hee. VELMA: How do we capture the Phantom Virus once we find him? KAUFMAN: The Phantom Virus is composed of electromagnetic energy. Get close enough to him with one of these, unh, supermagnets... ...and it will render him helpless. [GASPS] Be careful, Scooby. Those are pretty strong magnets. Sorry. Now let's really put them to the test. I knew l could count on you guys. [THUNDER CRASHING] DAPHNE: This building is so big. This Phantom Virus could be anywhere. I think we stand a better chance of finding it if we split up. Hey, you guys, I didn't say how we were gonna split up. Like, do we ever do it any other way? Do we really have to look in the basement? We have to search the whole buiIding, top to bottom. Wow. This stuff looks like it shouId be in the Smithsonian. Why do they bother keeping this oId junk? Oh, I don't know. Some of this old junk could be very valuable. [SNEEZES] Jinkies! lt's him! [CHUCKLlNG] Uh-oh. Watch out! [CACKLING] [SCREAMlNG] [GROANING] -The magnets. -The magnets. Get back, you... ...creepy...thingy! "Creepy thingy"? [PHANTOM VIRUS HISSES] You'll pay for this. We don't think so. Thingy! [SNlCKERS] [GROWLlNG] After him! [SLURPING AND MUNCHING] SHAGGY: Mmm. Mmm! -I wonder why they left. -I don't know. Man, it's bad enough we're always chasing real ghosts. Now we're chasing computer-generated ones. Yeah. It's a good thing phantoms don't care about lunch. Yeah. Hee-hee-hee! [CAN CREAKlNG] [GROANING] Huh? SCOOBY: Santa CIaus! [GIGGLING] I think we lost him. [WHISPERING] Wait. Look. [WHISPERING] What do we do? Get as close to him as possible with our magnets. Ready? One, two, three! I thought I heard some noise down here. What are you kids doing? The basement is for staff only. We're hunting for the Phantom Virus. Yeah, I heard about this so-called virus. I think it's some kind of college prank. No, no, Officer Wembley. You see, we-- You kids are coming with me back to Kaufman's lab. Can you believe the cafeteria ran out of food? And we're still hungry. Yeah, hungry. [ELECTRICITY CRACKLlNG] Uh-oh. I think I saw a vending machine down the hall. What is it, Scoob? Oh, hello, Mr. Phantom. Zoinks! [BOTH YELL] [CACKLING] Thank you for volunteering for our experiment, Mr. Virus. Nurse, take the patient over to the table. Okay. This way, please. Sit down. Just relax. Huh? Now, can you tell us how many layers are in an ideal cIub sandwich? Uh.... Time's up. The correct answer is "never enough." [ZAPPING] [SCREAMS] Let's try one more. When's the best time to enjoy a milkshake with your french fries? Uh.... Time's up. The answer is "anytime." Ohh.... [SCREAMS] [GROWLlNG] SHAGGY: Yikes! SCOOBY: Uh-oh! [MONKEY GIBBERING] [EXPLOSION] [GROANS] Shh! [GROWLS] DAPHNE: I'm worried about Shaggy and Scooby. They've been gone for a long time. Yeah. Maybe we should go look for them. Nobody goes anywhere until Professor Kaufman gets back. [BOTH YELLING] WEMBLEY: Huh? [YELLING] Ohh.... -What was that? -It's the Phantom! [YELLS] [ALL GRUNT] [ALL GASP] ALL: Huh? VELMA: Jinkies! It looks like we've been beamed into Eric's computer game. BILL: What? -The laser's been fired. WEMBLEY: At that Phantom Virus, I hope. I don't think so. Look here. Your friends have been transported into cyberspace. [BOTH GASP] So? Throw a switch or something and get them out. It doesn't work that way. They have to play through alI the levels to get out. -You're kidding me. -I wish he was. Until they can get out by winning every level of the game... ...the danger in there will be very real. Danger? Check this out. I'm like a superhero. Be careful, Shaggy. There's less gravity on the moon. Look. It's Super Shaggy! Scooby, could you get Shaggy back here before he hurts himself? Okay. Scooby-Dooby-Doo! Nice try, Scoob. Like, catch me if you can. Unh! ALL: Ooh. Shaggy, are you alI right? Uh, I think so. -But I made an important discovery. -What's that? In this video game, you can get hurt. Or worse. We'd better be careful. Velma's right. Eric said this game is full of creatures and who knows what else. Zoinks! -I know who! DAPHNE: Oh, no. VELMA: He must have gotten beamed into the game too. [YELLS] Help! Oh, no. He's not alone. Let's play ball. Like, let's not. DAPHNE: I thought we were chasing him. FRED: Back at the lab, we were. VELMA: But here in the game, he's got friends. SHAGGY: They don't look very friendly to me. I think we lost them. [SCOOBY WHIMPERING] You know, getting beamed into cyberspace might not be such a bad thing. -And how's that, Velma? -Yeah. Maybe if we play along, we can find out who created this virus. Right. Maybe we can find some clues. Remember what Eric said? We need to find the box of Scooby Snacks. And, like, there it is. DAPHNE: Wow, that was easy. It's only the first level of the game. It's supposed to be easy. PHANTOM VIRUS: Over there! DAPHNE: Oh, no, here they come! -Look, a rover. -Huh? FRED: A moon rover. SHAGGY: And what a cool paint job. FRED: Come on, guys. This thing needs new shocks. As Iong as it gets us away from those moon goons, who cares? Oh, no. They've got a set of wheels too. Zoinks! DAPHNE: Step on it, Freddy. They're gaining on us! I am, but this is as fast as it goes. SCOOBY: Aah! SHAGGY: Oh, man, he got us! It's okay, guys. The Scooby Snacks are right there. Oh, boy! Scooby Snacks! Scooby-Dooby-Doo! Go, Scooby, go! FRED: Uh-oh! SCOOBY: Uh-oh! [PHANTOM VIRUS YELLS] Yikes! Stop that dog. Come on, Scoob. You can do it, pal. -Hi. -Careful, Scooby. Huh? Aah! [BOTH GRUNTlNG] [GIGGLING] Huh? What happened to--? VELMA: What? -Where are we now? If l'm not mistaken, we're inside the Roman Colosseum. -CoIosseum? SHAGGY: Like where they play football? VELMA: Not exactly. In ancient Rome... ...people used to gather in the Colosseum to watch all kinds of events. You mean like sports and music? Yeah, they did that too. But the Colosseum is famous as the place... ...where the Romans fed people to the lions for Iunch. -Lions? DAPHNE: WeIl, it looks deserted now. Speaking of lunch, we didn't even get to keep... ...the Scooby Snacks from the moon level. Aww. Don't worry, Scoob. l bet there's a concession stand somewhere. -Hey. What's this? VELMA: What are these white lines for? Like, it's chaIk. Yikes! Virus! VELMA & DAPHNE: Huh? Welcome to level two, game players, where things get a little tougher. But first, let me introduce you to the home team. [YELLING] Those guys Iook like they've got a bone to pick, huh, Scoob? Uh-huh. Don't worry, gang, we can beat these meatless gladiators. And now for the home team's mascot. [GROWLlNG] DAPHNE: The lion's got the Scooby Snacks. You know, for once, I'm not in the mood for Scooby Snacks. Me neither! [ROARS] Yikes! DAPHNE: Good idea, Scooby. -Come on, Shaggy. [YELLING] Aah! FRED: Shaggy! -Are you all right, Shaggy? -Yeah, but I'm really tangled up. [LION ROARING] [GLADIATORS YELLING] -A chariot. FRED: Good thinking, Scoob. Thank you. Yikes! Faster, Scoob! Faster! [SCOOBY GRUNTING AND WHlMPERlNG] Yikes! Like, hit the turbo, Scoob. Good work, guys. You handle the gladiators and we'll take care of this lion. And how exactly are we going to do that? Give me your jacket. But l just bought this. Daphne! Oh, all right. Here. I know this isn't red, but it'lI have to do. Toro! Toro! [GRUNTING] Leo! Leo! Olé! -Oh, that was too close. -I have an idea. Leo! Leo! Whoa! VELMA: Now! Way to go, girls. -Thanks. -This wiIl hold him. Mwah. That was very brave, Freddy. Heh. Thanks. Oh. Here's your jacket. [SHAGGY AND SCOOBY YELLING] Shaggy and Scooby need our help. Come on! [SCOOBY YELLING] [GLADIATORS YELLING] [SHAGGY YELLS] [BOTH GROAN] Zoinks! [BOTH YELLING] [COUGHING] Good going, guys. Yeah, whatever. Keep those gIadiators busy a little bit longer. I'll get the Scooby Snacks. -That's easy for you to say, man. -Yeah. Try to lead them up into the stands. Like, l don't think we have the energy. But maybe we do. -Here. -What are we supposed to do with these? Use them to pole-vault over the wall. Like, and then what? Never mind. [BOTH GRUNTlNG] [GLADIATORS GRUNTING] Friends, Romans and spooky gladiators. All hail Emperor Scooby! -Uh-oh. -Huh? [GLADIATORS GROWLING] [SCOOBY WHIMPERING] SHAGGY & SCOOBY: Huh? So where are we now? FRED: It looks like a jungle of some kind. DAPHNE: It's gorgeous here. I'll say. This place beats ancient Rome any day, eh, Scoob? Uh-huh. [SCREECHING] [SCOOBY GASPS] [SCREECHING] [DAPHNE GASPS] Oh, no. This is a prehistoric jungle. I take back what I said. Rome is loveIy this time of year. FRED: Hey. Look over there. [STOMPING] -Huh? -Huh? What's that? [PHANTOM VIRUS CACKLING] How's this for a heavy hitter? Jinkies! He's riding a T. rex. [TYRANNOSAURUS ROARlNG] Let's head for the trees. It's too thick for them to follow. [SCOOBY AND SHAGGY PANTING] [GROANS] BILL: That was a close one. ERlC: Yeah, but they're doing pretty good so far. I'm wondering something here, fellas. Who activated that laser and sent those poor kids into the game? Who knows? Could be anyone. Even someone in this very room. DAPHNE: We just hiked through miles ofjungle... ...and still can't find the Scooby Snacks. Well, we'd better. Otherwise we'lI be stuck in this level forever. SHAGGY: All I know is that this virus likes to scare us in cyberspace... ...as much as in the real world. [GIGGLING] Hey, nice work, guys. Which one of you did the drawing over there? -Not me. -Not me. -It looks like a volcano. -I wonder if it means anything. ALL: Huh? Oh, no. The fire is going out. It's gonna be dark in a few hours too. Scooby and Shaggy, it's your turn to get the firewood. -Aww. All right. Come on, Scoob. -Okay. Like, just a few more sticks and we can head back, Scoob. [SNlFFING] -Smoke. -Smoke? Zoinks! Up there! Like, aIl the trees are burning. [BOTH YELL] Like, where did that come from? Volcano. [RUMBLING] Forget the wood, Scoob. We've gotta warn the others. [SHAGGY AND SCOOBY PANTING] What happened, you guys? And where's the firewood? Like, if we don't get out of here soon... ...we're alI going to be firewood. -What are you talking about, Shaggy? -Volcano. Volcano? Oh, great. It looks like it's really cooking. I bet that's where the Scooby Snacks are. Huh? VELMA: That drawing is a clue to lead us to the Scooby Snacks. But it's miles away. It'll take us hours to get there. -Where there's a will, there's-- -Woolly mammoths? [MAMMOTH BELLOWING] Mammoths didn't live in the same age as dinosaurs, but l'm not complaining. Well, I am. l wish Eric had put saddles on these guys. I can't take much more of this. I wish he wouId have made them smell better too. P-yew! How you guys doing? Like, do you have an airsickness bag? [BURPS] Well, hang on, guys. We're aImost there. Any sign of the Scooby Snacks? SHAGGY: Like, aIl I can see is smoke. And Iava! [MAMMOTHS BELLOWING] [SCREECHING] [DAPHNE GASPS] Look up there. That poor baby pterodactyl is trapped. -Poor little guy. -Aww. [RUMBLING] The volcano's erupting again. No. We've got company. [PHANTOM VIRUS CACKLING] [TYRANNOSAURUS ROARlNG] Start climbing. SCOOBY: Yikes! Whew. [GIGGLING] [GRUNTS] [SHAGGY GULPS] I think we're safe. The T. rex is buiIt for running, not climbing. Look. The mama pterodactyl is trying to save its baby. Uh-oh. Hey, where you going, Scoob? DAPHNE: Be careful, Scooby! Hello. [PTERODACTYL COOlNG] [GRUNTING] Huh? Scooby Snacks! [SCREECHING] Huh? Hey, he found the Scooby Snacks. [GROANING] [GROWLlNG] [DRAGON GROWLING] [SCOOBY NEIGHlNG] -I think we're finalIy home. -Ahh. No more monsters chasing us. Let's celebrate with some chow. Yeah, yeah. Uh, it might be a littIe early for a celebration, gang. Look. DAPHNE: Oh, my! SHAGGY: Zoinks! Oh, man, we're still in the game. -And I thought we were home free. -Yeah. BILL: Okay. They've made it to the last level. But this one's the toughest of them all. No player has ever won it, not even me. It'll take everything they've got just to survive. So now what? All we have to do is find the last box of Scooby Snacks. But this city is so big. Where do we start? Hey, let's see if that woman knows anything. DAPHNE: Excuse us, ma'am, we were wondering-- Surprise! [DAPHNE SCREAMS] -The virus! -Welcome to the final level. You're in the major leagues now. VELMA: Run! Like, where are we going? Hey, let's hide in the malt shop. SHAGGY: Great idea, Freddy. [ALL PANTING] Can someone help us? -Zoinks! -Zoinks! -You're me. -And, like, you're me. [BOTH GASP] You're the characters in Eric's video game. And you're from the reaI world. -Jinkies! -Jinkies! Did I really wear that years ago? That jacket with that skirt? -Hmm. -Hmm. -Nice ascot. -Heh. Works for me. -Huh? -Huh? Blah! Hmm. [SNlFFING] Hmm. I guess it's been a while since we've seen Eric. He hasn't seen our fashion changes. We'll go shopping Iater. Like, why don't you join us for a little snack? Man, I thought you'd never ask. [WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY] Okay. [MUTTERING INDISTINCTLY] Ahh. [SCOOBY WHIMPERING] Here you go, paI. Thanks a lot. Huh? -Hey! -Hey! [GRUNTING] We don't have time to play around. We need to find the Scooby Snacks and get out of here. -You guys need to relax. -Yeah, what are you worried about? Aren't you afraid of the Phantom Virus? Phantom who? Never heard of him. -You're kidding. -Oh, I get it. The virus isn't part of this game. He has no reason to be looking for our cyber doubles. Well, you cyber guys are lucky. The Phantom Virus is creepy and has this really scary laugh. [PHANTOM VIRUS CACKLING] Just like that. PHANTOM VIRUS: Come out and play. [BOTH WHlMPERlNG] VELMA: It's him. Come out, come out. Let's get out of here. The Mystery Machine is out back. -I'lI drive. -I'lI drive. FRED: Wow. This is nostalgic. I miss this old van. In cyberworld, things never get old. It's pretty cooI. There's a lot to like in cyberworId. There's stores, theaters, and parks... ...and lots of tasty food. Yeah. Hee-hee-hee! But what about all the monsters and viIlains? We haven't seen any. They're probably guarding the Scooby Snacks. You mean you guys don't know where the Scooby Snacks are? Oh, we know where they are. There's just no reason to go after them. Because even if we get the Scooby Snacks... ...we go right back to the beginning of the game. And we Iike it here. Until you guys showed up with that Phantom Virus, that is. -We would gladly get rid of him for you. -If we couId. You know, if all 1 0 of us team up... ...the Phantom Virus wouldn't stand a chance. Yeah. Well, I guess we were going to go after the Scooby Snacks eventually. -So you'll help? -Count us in. Well, then let's go. [CARNlVAL MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS] CYBER-FRED: Well, here we are. [WAVES LAPPlNG] Man, this place is awesome. So where are the Scooby Snacks? On the Scooby game, of course. Right inside the video arcade. [CRACKING] Hm. What's that sound? There it is again. -Baseball. -Cyber-Scooby is right. There's a batting cage over there. FRED: Wow, that guy is realIy clobbering the ball. Hey, man. Great swing. Thanks. Want my autograph? [ALL GASP] Let's play ball. [ALL SCREAM] Everybody make a run for the video arcade! [ALL GASP] Creeper! [GROWLS] -Jeepers, it's the Creeper! -The what? He's one of the villains from our past. And he's got a pet. [ROARS] It's Jaguaro. He's supposed to be in Brazil. Huh? [YELLS] Gator Ghoul and the Tar Monster? [BOTH GROWLING] Head for the beach! Uh-uh. -No way. -Look. SHAGGY: It's Old Iron Face. [GROWLlNG] Man, you guys know some strange peopIe. It's like every villain we've ever faced is here. Maybe we shouldn't have told Eric so much about our mysteries. PHANTOM VIRUS: How right you are, my dear. [ALL GROWLING] Wait a minute. All these creatures in the reaI world turned out to be just people in costumes. Velma's right. They were all fakes. Nice try, Phantom Virus, but you can't fooI us. -Yeah. -Yeah. [BOTH GRUNTlNG] [ROARS] Tough time with the mask, guys? He-- He-- He's real! [GIGGLES] [ROARS] DAPHNE: That means that they're all real! Creeper! [BOTH YELLING] [GROANING] Whoa! Whoa. Get them! FRED & CYBER-FRED: Let's split up, gang. VELMA: Right. SHAGGY: Okay, Freddy. Step right up and test your strength. [GROWLlNG] How about you, handsome? -Me? -Yes, you, sir. Let us show you how easy it is. [YELLS] CYBER-DAPHNE: Creepy. Why'd you pick this place to hide? Me? I was folIowing you. If you thought this wasn't a good place, you shouId have said something. [BOTH YELP] Where did that come from? These fun houses have all sorts of trap doors. Let's keep an eye open for more. CYBER-DAPHNE: Oh, no! What's wrong? Ugh! Look how fat I am. Oh, it's just a trick mirror. You Iook perfect. Oh, thanks. You too. Creeper! [BOTH SCREAM] -Keep away from us. -What do we do? DAPHNE: Ha! [GRUNTING] Sorry. You're not our type. [YELLING] Creeper. Yeah! Way to go, girl. [CREEPER GRUNTING] CYBER-DAPHNE: He's climbing back up. [CREEPER YELLlNG] That door won't hold him long. Hey, where are you? Come on. Is he still behind us? FRED: Yup. That walking handbag will reach us any minute now. [GASPS] -Look. -Oh, no. -What do we do now? -Jump! What? We must be five stories high. Down there! One, two, three. Go! [BOTH YELLING] [GRUNTING] Wow, that was some jump. [BOTH GRUNT] Yeah. But it beats getting eaten by an alligator. Heh. Just bareIy. [GATOR GHOUL GROWLING] See you later, alIigator. VELMA: These wax figures are pretty creepy. At least they're not real. [BUBBLlNG] Hey, what's that? This must be where they make the wax figurines. Hey. That one looks like-- [GROWLlNG] -Old Iron Face! -Old Iron Face! -Jinkies! -Jinkies! Let's get out of here. [BOTH GRUNT] -Oh, no, my glasses. -Mine too. [OLD IRON FACE GRUNTING] -Thanks. -Thanks. [BOTH GASP] [GROWLlNG] [WHIMPERING] VELMA: The wax is hardening. He can't move. [ROARS] Yes, he can. Let's get out of here. [CARNlVAL MUSIC PLAYING] [ROARS] [GASPING] [SIGHS] [SNEEZES] [ROARS] [BOTH YELLING] [SCOOBY AND CYBER-SCOOBY WHIMPERING] [MUSIC SPEEDS UP] [MEWLS] FRED: Great work, Scoobs. [WHIMPERING] Don't be scared. It's just us. I thought we lost him. [BOTH SCREAM] SHAGGY & CYBER-SHAGGY: Yikes! Go, Shaggys! Like, the Tar Monster is right behind us. And, boy, is he mad! [GROWLlNG] Let's get out of here! [ALL YELLING] [BLEATS] [CHEEPING] [ELECTRICITY BUZZlNG] [POPPING] [ROARS] SCOOBY & CYBER-SCOOBY: Whee! [BOTH GRUNT] [ROARING] [BOTH WHlMPERlNG] -Yikes! -Huh? Look. CYBER-SCOOBY: Uh-oh! [JAGUARO GROWLING] -Bye-bye! -Bye-bye! [GASPS] -Scooby-Doos! -Where are you? I wonder where they are. -Over here. -Over here. There they are. SHAGGY: Come on, Scooby. CYBER-SHAGGY: Come on, Scooby. [BOTH LAUGHING] Now that we're all here, we've got one last monster to face. The Phantom Virus. And this is the final level so the virus won't be easy to beat. Hey, what's this? Zoinks! I've still got the magnet Professor Kaufman gave me. You had that magnet with you all this time and forgot about it? Yeah. I guess l was too busy being scared. [LAUGHlNG] What's wrong with Cyber-Shag? [SNlFFING] [GRUNTS] What's going on here? The cyber-gang is made of electromagnetic energy... ...and therefore affected by the magnet. Just like the Phantom Virus. What's this about a magnet? Hey, we have a way to beat the virus now. And we know he's guarding the Scooby Snacks in there. -We need your gang to stay here. -You don't want us to help you? We wouldn't want you to get hurt by the magnet again. Magnet? What are you talking about? Oh, never mind. Heh-heh-heh. SHAGGY: Man, this is one great video arcade. SCOOBY: Uh-huh. Just keep an eye open for the virus. Look. There's the Scooby-Doo video game. VELMA: And the Scooby Snacks. Oh, boy. Scooby Snacks! [PHANTOM VIRUS CACKLING] [SCOOBY WHIMPERING] Like, l hear him, but I don't see him. Ta-da! Ready to play some games? [CACKLING] [ALL YELLING] Shaggy, the magnet! Huh? Oh, right. VELMA: You need to get closer. -Like, that's easy for you to say. Then toss the magnet over here. With pIeasure. Hey, Mr. Zappy! No! -It's working. Scooby, go grab the snacks. -Okay. FRED: Hurry, Scooby. I don't know how much longer this is gonna work! [PHANTOM VIRUS SCREAMING] [FRED GRUNTING] DAPHNE: Oh, no! Oh, tough break. [YELLS] Freddy! [CACKLING] -Aah! -Not again! [WHIMPERING] If you thought my hitting was good... ...wait till you see my pitching. [YELPS] What do we do now? CYBER-DAPHNE: Looks like they're in trouble. Like, we've gotta do something. Right. Let's go help them. [ROARING] [ALL GASP] CYBER-VELMA: Oh, no. They're back. [ALL YELL] CYBER-DAPHNE: Oh, no. Yow! Huh? [PHANTOM VIRUS CACKLING] Scooby? -Cyber-Scooby? -That's right. It's no use. We need some wire cutters. -I got an idea. Wanna help? -Okay. Great. Here's the pIan. Huh? [WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY] Uh-huh. Yoo-hoo! Over here. What are you doing, Scooby? Scooby, get back here. You're down to your final out. Huh? I've never seen Scooby so brave. Oh, I get it. That's Cyber-Scooby. And that's old Scoob going for the snacks. Meddling canine! Yikes! -HeIp! -Oh, no. [BOTH GASP] [GASPS] [GIGGLES] No! All right, Scoob! [SCREAMlNG] Yes! Huh? You did it! You beat the Phantom Virus. Great job, guys. DAPHNE: Ooh! It looks like we're leaving. Are you sure you wanna split? There's a lot of cyber-buffets to try here. Yeah. Okay. Sorry, but we have to go. SCOOBY: Ooh! VELMA: Wow! -I guess this is goodbye. ALL: Bye! Thanks for all the heIp. Bye, Scooby. [ALL GASP] [WEMBLEY YELPS] You're back! I thought you'd be stuck in the game forever. Ha, ha. Like, there's no place like home. -Everyone okay? -I think so. Well done. You've saved the world from a terribIe menace. But did you find out who created the virus? We've got a pretty good idea. Good. Because whoever created the virus must be punished. Glad you agree, professor, because you're as much a suspect as anyone here. What, me? But l'm a scientist. I've dedicated my life to my students and this university. But you also stood to make a quarter-million dollars at the science fair. If you stole the invention. Oh! Preposterous! And Iet's not forget Officer Wembley. What? I'm an officer of the law. Sort of. Anyway, I've never committed a crime in my life. You were the onIy person that was with us in the lab... ...when we got sent into the game. But once inside the game, we found some important clues. Our first clue came when we were on the moon level. The Phantom Virus shouted, "Play ball!" And on the Colosseum Ievel, we found some chalk lines like a large diamond. But our biggest clue was on the final Ievel. When the Phantom Virus appeared in a batting cage. All I'm getting is that the virus had a thing for... ...baseball! Bill! WEMBLEY: Not so fast, kid. [GASPING] [BILL GRUNTS THEN YELLS] [GROANS] Okay, son, it's all over. -Bill, you were my best friend. -And my best student. -But you didn't pick my project. -What's that supposed to mean? Professor Kaufman chose your video design over mine... ...even though I've been here two years longer. Students are all equal, Bill. So you invented the Phantom Virus, hoping it would scare Eric away. That's right. And it worked... ...till you guys showed up. You were afraid that we would find out who created the virus. So you beamed us into cyberspace. The prize would've been all mine, if it wasn't for-- Us meddling kids! [ALL LAUGH] I wanna thank you for getting rid of that Phantom Virus. Lunch is on me, guys. In that case, I'll have another cheeseburger. -Two cheeseburgers. -No problem. I'm sorry you guys got trapped in cyberspace. -Well, it really wasn't all that bad. -Really? Going back in time was reaIly fun. You did a great job designing aIl the game levels. Well, thanks, Daphne. But next time, go easier on the monsters. Hey, Shaggy, l just pulIed up... ...the Scooby-Doo video game on my laptop. Wanna play? What do you say, Scoob? Now that there's no creepy virus in the game. Mm-hm! Haven't you had enough for one day? Zoinks! Look. What are you doing, Scoob? DAPHNE: Now that's what I call hacking. Hacking and Scooby-Snacking. Scooby-Dooby-Doo! I may be a bit of a bookworm, but I've got a wild side too. That's why my favorite part of Scooby-Doo and the Cyber Chase... ...was shooting in the prehistoric jungle. It really brought out the animal in me. This one likes me. Look how calm he is. [TRUMPETS] -Jinkies! Ahh! -Huh? Unh! Thanks, Scooby. [GASPS] Hey, Velma, that one likes you too. VELMA: Trying to tame those woolly mammoths was like a prehistoric rodeo. Shaggy found out what it was like to be a real cowpoke. And after a little practice, Scooby and I started the first cattle drive. My dream of playing professional baseball ended pretty early. But another dream of mine came true when we made the movie. Fred Jones, gladiator. You Iook so cute in that outfit, Freddy. Cute? That's not what I was going for. [GRUNTS] [GASPS] SHAGGY: You can beat him, Fred! [BOTH GRUNT] All that Frisbee-playing with Shaggy really paid off. FRED: I was amazed at how much acting like Shaggy helped me during battle. I lured my opponents into traps, jumped high when I was scared... ...and most importantly, ran really fast. Just because I wear nice clothes and like to shop... ...doesn't mean l don't have a sense of adventure. That's why I enjoyed shooting at the North Pole. Besides, when it's 40 below, no one cares what you're wearing. -The air is so cold. -You gotta keep moving around. Shaggy and Scooby have the right idea. They're doing Arctic aerobics. [GROWLS] Like, help! [GROANS] [WHIMPERING] -Nice work, Daphne. -Now you know why I accessorize. DAPHNE: If you're exploring the Arctic, you need to make sacrifices. Your shelter must be practical, you need to travel light... ...and most importantly, enjoy the 24 hours of sunlight. The part I enjoyed most about this movie... ...was all the time Scooby and I got to spend at the arcade. Like, there's only one thing I love more than playing games... ...and that's winning at them. One more point and I win. [GRUNTING] Game over, Scoob. Like, I'm the air-hockey champion of the worId! [GRUNTS] [WHOOPING] Yeah! Yeah! Two out of three? SHAGGY: I could have been a better sport, or at least not gotten so excited. But when I rubbed it in after beating him at free throws... ...Scooby made a winning shot of his own. Your turn, Scoob. What was your favorite part of Scooby - Doo and the Cyber Chase ? The laser. Like, l got it. Fire away, Scoob. Zoinks! It's amazing what you can find on the Web, eh, Scoob? Uh-huh. SHAGGY: We visited the Scooby Snacks home page... ...found a great Web site for dessert... ...which I found out was spelled with two S's. Ha-ha-ha. And best of all, we got to see an old friend, right, Scoob? SCOOBY: Scooby-Dooby-Doo! [EngIish - US - SDH] [EngIish - US - SDH] [SCOOBY LAUGHS]
