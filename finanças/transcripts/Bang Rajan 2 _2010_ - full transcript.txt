NINE BODHI TREES TEMPLE NEAR BANG RAJAN CAMP Please, Your Reverence. Where are we going, Daeng? Back to where you live. Seven months later, Ayutthaya was plunged into chaos. Having been now surrounded by the Burmese troops for 13 months, the people of Ayutthaya were no longer united against them. Some had even killed each other and surrendered to the enemy to save their lives. Some, aware that staying would mean death, had evacuated from Ayutthaya. And some had formed a local resistance. The Burmese called these warriors the "Yantric Cloth Bandits". Their fame came to the attention of the Burmese troops leader, Nemiao Sihabodi. Suki, take a look at these two. Kill them! They weren't immortal warriors after all. This is just the monk's Yantric cloth. You haven't brought me his head yet. I don't need him as my opponent. Nemiao Sihabodi, I've never seen his face. I'll give you some warriors to help you find him. Don't screw up this time. I called all of you here to let you know it's been a while since I had news from Ayutthaya. I don't know whether we won or lost. That's why l need all of you to decide what we should do next. Ban Huay Dang has about 200 men. If we join up with other villagers we might withstand the Burmese. Don't you guys know Bang Rajan villagers were just slaughtered by the Burmese? I think we'd better hide. Whatever the Burmese do or want... just let them have it. I absolutely disagree with you. You want to let the Burmese to crush us? I agree. We all have to fight them together. We have the Reverend Father with us. We'll defeat them for sure. I don't agree! -I don't agree! -I agree! -I don't agree! -I agree! -I don't agree! -I agree! -I don't agree! -I agree! -I agree! -Stop it! What's got into you? This is not the time to argue. Aren't we supposed to unite? Wait! You aren't Bhikkhu Thammachot. -I wish I could have a yantric cloth. -Bhikku Kong's amulet is also sacred. Your stubbornness... will get all of us killed. I think Ayutthaya might be finding a way to fight back. If I get any updates, I'll summon all of you here again. Phya Thot... our people need a good person like you to depend on. Alright. Come and get your blessings. Come on! Let's get the blessing. Come on! Kill all of them... even the monk. The Ayutthaya troops ambushed the Burmese army. Master Suki must remove them from the forest. None of them is the monk you're looking for. Come on! Move! Walk! Come on! Keep walking! Move! Don't stop! Keep walking! Come on! Follow them! Don't splash their blood onto us. There they are! Go after them. Go! Quickly! Hold the gun. Gun. Nice fall. Come on. How are you? Thank you for saving us, otherwise we'd be dead. Don't mention it. Are all of you yantric cloth warriors? Then Bhikkhu Thammachot must be with you. Can we join your village? These children are orphans. The monk will take care of them. We can't go with you. Take care of my kid. I'll be back after the war. I don't want to go with them. I don't want to go! I don't want to go with them, Dad. I don't want to go! I don't want to go! She's been crying all the way. She must be tired. How could a father leave his child behind? He also lost his wife in the battlefield. I don't think he's gonna survive. They're not afraid of death as long as they have hope to return to their loved ones. Impossible. Now, there are Burmese all over the place. I don't think he's gonna make it. If we could eat the Burmese, we wouldn't starve. They're not your family so you can say that. What would you do if you lost your wife? No problem, I'd just get a new one. I wish that was true. The first thing you'd do when you got to the camp is screw her. How long have we been living in hiding? Now we rob the Burmese to survive, even though this is our own land. We've never stood on it with pride. Yes. It's been so long I've almost forgotten what it was like to see the entire village get killed by the Burmese. That time, Kiew and Eang... were nearly killed. Eang would be dead if Mun and Daeng had not helped him. After the war, I'll find some good land to make a paddy field. I've already found a beautiful land near the Kok Salud village. You guys should see it. Daeng, when are you gonna marry Chaba? I know she's been waiting for you a long time. I can be your matchmaker and ask for her hand on your behalf. When l return home, I’ll find the perfect time to marry her. That's my man. Then you'll know... how much happiness you can have when you have a wife. All night long. Daddy. Daddy... don't leave me. Daddy... don't leave me. One day your dad will come back to you. Look! Mun and his men are back. Where have you been? I thought I'd never see you again. I got caught by the Burmese. These guys helped me out. That's all right. Let's pay respect to the Father first. It's good that you've returned safely. Every time you go, I can't help worrying about you. We rescued these people when we confronted the Burmese at Huay Yai. You make sure they have somewhere to stay. Kom, Kiew. Let's go. -Let's split up. -You go get the supplies. That hurts, Chaba. How did l know that it was you? You sneaked up on me like this, I thought it was someone else. So if it's me, you'll let me do anything, won't you? Daeng, l didn't mean that at all. Let me go. Someone may see and tell my mother. I want you to marry me. I've never said l wanted to marry you. My mother has not yet agreed to give me to you. So that means if she agrees then you'll be mine? You are so impatient. I will be your wife sooner or later. Finding food is getting harder and harder. Burmese soldiers are all over the place. Aren't you gonna eat anything? I need to see if the provisions have been allocated equally. You two can have my share. Hop-Headed Barleria, Father. I got them when we passed through the Thong Lang forest. You're such a good gatherer. The captives say a contingent of Burmese troops will be in this area. I think we have to move again. If they're really coming, we'll think about it then. Mun took a lot of captives to our hideout. I'm afraid that we don't have enough food. Can you let them die without food? Alright, Kom. We can still handle it, can't we? The more people the better. We can help each other. Ah... Daeng... Is something troubling you? It's late, but you're still up. How can you tell, Daeng? You've raised me since l was a kid. I know you well. Our hideout has more people now. We're running out of food. We need medicine as well. I'm counting on you and Mun to take care of this matter. Don't worry about it, Your Reverence. But l need your help for something. I need an auspicious time for me to marry Chaba. Put a lot of herbs on him. Mai, why are you crying like a baby? Hang in there. You'll get better very soon. Mun, we don't get much food left. We'll try to find some more. Mun, there are too many people here for us to take care of. Any prisoners that are dying, just leave them to die. If you keep taking care of them, we'll starve to death. -Where can they go now? -You can't save all. Mark my words, Mun. Have we got enough rice for everyone? Go ahead. I'm not hungry yet. You need to eat well. How long are you gonna be away this time? I told you. There are too many people to feed. No matter how much you find it won't be enough. Those people eat a lot. You did not speak like that when we first came here. Weren't our lives as tough as theirs? Capture them! Kill anyone who resists! The Burmese caravan is coming this way. We're Thai. Why are you dressed like the Burmese? They forced us to. Should we let them rob before we do? Which bastard dares to rob the supplies before me? Hold on. Look! The Burmese! Follow me! What should we do? Retreat! Do you remember me? Yes. You're the soldier who deserted. Phya Thot's warrior. Who the hell are these stupid soldiers? Watch your mouth or you'll be beheaded. I appreciate your help. I've heard about you for a long time. I can't believe I meet you today. -Is the monk alright? -Do you know him too? The sacrifices of Bang Rajan villages, everybody knows about that. Sir. Thirty of our soldiers died. First, we take care of the wounded. We can discuss our next move later. Mun, are you sure that we should take these soldiers back to the village? Do you want to let them die here? All of you trust me. I know Phya Lek's army well. I guarantee these guys never betrayed anybody. So if we have a problem, who will be responsible? If they betray us, you can cut my head off. I'll not die from this fucking Burmese arrow wound. If l die, it will be by your hands... sir! I'm alright. Just give me some booze... and I’ll still be able to fight. I think we should let Phya's men rest a little while. Then we can continue. Mun, aren't you afraid the Burmese will catch up and cut our heads off? Daeng! What the hell are you doing? It will ease the pain. If l get the chance to return to Ayutthaya, I'II tell his loved ones how courageous he was on the battlefield. There's a fire on the mountain over there! That is Kao Khow Sai village. No, it's not Khow Sai village. It's Ayutthaya. The Burmese were already there a few hours ago. The people of Ayutthaya... are suffering. A lot of our soldiers died because of that monk. Now he's working with the Ayutthayan soldiers. It's not going to be easy to fight them. General Suki, you should be very careful. It won't be long before the battle of Bang Rajan village starts up again. Who the hell is that Phya? He's the general of the Ayutthayan army. They are fierce warriors, not afraid to die. Better let them all join up first. So I can see just how tough they are. -Hey, look! Mun is back. -Mun is back! Tong. You are back. We are happy to return and pay our respects to Your Reverence. Where have you been? I'm Phaya Lek. I received orders to fight the Burmese in this area. We confronted them and nearly lost the battle, but these villagers helped us. You all should take some rest first. When you are healed we'll talk. Wait, let me close the door. Do it gently, Buab. You're hurting him. It was so hard catching this chicken. Maybe I can give it to your mother and please her so she'll give me her daughter. Do you think food is so important to her? Just look at the size of your mother. Okay. Let me take it to her. Mom! Mom! -Daeng's given you a chicken! -Oh, a chicken! Good, go boil some water. What's going on, Daeng? -They're boiling water. -Wow, so fast. What were you guys thinking? Why did you bring all those soldiers here? Those soldiers are in trouble. Don't you think... they will cause trouble? You all know very well. If they cause any trouble, I will run them out of here. If Sena has offered his head as a guarantee, then those soldiers are good people. I don't think they came here to cause trouble. But l do think they came for other reasons. Whenever you are away fighting, I can't sleep. I'm scared you'll never be back to see me. When is this war going to end? Your physique is good. You'd better join our army. I have a wife and have to take care of these villagers. I can't leave. You should stay here. The villagers would be happy. I'm a soldier and my job is to take care of the kingdom. I don't know how to be a farmer. But thanks for inviting me. Who threw that at my head? Chaba, what's wrong with you? You gave me a scare. -That bitch is crazy. -I'll be right back. Makham, you're all grown up now. When will you get married? So you won't be lonely. I prefer being single so I'll never be sad. How can you be happy with a husband like that? You can't find out until you've tried it yourself. What's wrong with you? Why are you looking at me like that? I got the auspicious time for our marriage. When is it? I think you should go now. Go! I've been out too long, my mother will complain. If you don't leave, I will. Chaba! I'm going to ask your mother for your hand in marriage. Makham! Have you got a husband already? Hey, Buab. You have a very black heart. Shouldn't you treat my wound too? Your wound is so small you don't need medicine. It will be gone in a few days. Did l hurt you? -Sorry, I did not mean it. -Hey, Pan. Who are you taking those things to? I'm giving it to the soldiers. Come on... here! What did you do that for? You bastard! Why did you dump that? We don't have much food here. So what? Hey! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Don't fight. We're family. They're family too. Why are you guys fighting? You should save your strength to fight the Burmese! Both of you are soldiers. Why do you act like hooligans? Go away! I hope it's the end of this argument. Muen, I have something to ask you. What is it, sir? If you want to be a leader, you have to think and make decisions. Some decisions are tough, but eventually, you have to make the correct choice. Pack everything. The Burmese army is coming. We'll need more people to help us. Where are you going, sir? I'm going to see the monk. Why do you want to see him? That's none of your business. But l need to know. Okay, I'll tell you. I'm going to ask the monk to find people to help me fight the Burmese. You don't need to ask the monk. No one here is gonna join you. Everyone here is fighting for their own survival. When it's over, everyone will go their own way. Because of people like you, the kingdom is like this. Keep on fighting and you'll be dead. Why are you all fighting? Right now our kingdom is in trouble. Isn't that enough? So, what were you two arguing about? I need more people to prevent the Burmese army from coming here. This battle can only be lost, not won. With our force now, if we fight, we'll all die. In the battlefield, anything can happen. But you shouldn't put the villagers' lives at risk. Phaya, Mun. I know you all mean well, but have you asked all your men who wants to fight and who doesn't? Those who want to fight, let them fight. Whoever doesn't, just let them go. You people can't force anybody. I'll do what I intended to do... with or without help. Don't be angry with them. They're only doing their job. The soldiers must protect the kingdom. Sometimes the affairs of the kingdom come before personal matters. I was a soldier before. I understand them very well. You've fought in many battles before. So why don't you just think sensibly? They're going to take our land. I can't just sit back and let that happen. Phaya, just because you're the leader, it doesn't mean that everything you do is correct. You are at a crossroads. So whatever you do, I want you to think carefully about the outcome. At this time, our kingdom needs a soldier like you. If so, we can't trust the Ayutthayans. They've left their war for the Bang Rajan villagers to fight. It's not like that. There are good people we can trust too. But now, bad people are taking advantage of everyone. That's why the kingdom has problems. With the kingdom like this, we cannot depend on anyone. So what kind of man is Phya, sir? if you're looking for someone good, Phya Lek is the first person I would recommend. I've got chickens. Tell me which one you like. I'll get Phan and Kiew to catch it. -The hen. -Hey, he likes the hens! Now, my army has surrounded Ayutthaya. But l still didn't get the monk's head. You have to admit you're inefficient. We're near him now. It won't be long until we get him. My orders were precise. I've given Mangchai this job. If that is what you want, Nemiao, I'II do it... even if I die. You go to get Phya Thot and take him to Mangchai. Now! Go! GENERAL MANGCHAI'S CAMP You all can leave. I want to be with my wife. Go! Lamduan. I promise not to hurt you like the other captives. Mom... Mom. Mom, wake up and eat. Here. Eat slowly, Mom. Go! Obey him. You, Thais, be good and you can eat. Saeng! How did you fix my shoes? They're still broken! -You made my feet hurt all day. -Where? Dad, are you alright? Wait! I'll fix them again. Perfectly... perfectly... So why didn't you do it well the first time, you bastard? Saeng, I've gathered many people. We're escaping from here. Do you want to go with us? Since you're my old friend, I'm not going to tell the Burmese about your plan. You better forget it, or you all will end up dead. Okay, you jerk, then you just keep on being their servant! Nemiao expects you to accomplish this task. Make sure you won't let him down. Those cheap-ass bandits will see how a real bandit works! Take this food to feed the villagers. Go. Take it easy. We have enough for everyone. Grandma, take it. Don't fight over it. Grandma, come over here. Take it easy. There's plenty for everyone. Hey, Chumpee. -That's alright. Come on. -Help me. Chumpee! It's alright. Come on. You better get some rest. I'm all right. Mun, I'm pregnant. Are you serious? Is it a boy or a girl? Are you crazy? How should I know? If it kicks your tummy, it's a boy. I'm only pregnant a month. It can't kick. Are you crazy? It looks like you want a boy. Boy or girl is fine. I'd love it the same. Chumpee, at this time... I'm afraid that the baby will be born into hardship. I have no idea what lies ahead. All I know is that each day... there must be enough food and a safe place to sleep for everyone. Don't worry, we'll have the monk's head soon. I'm positive the guy I've sent can pull it off. Then I'll get in their camp and kill the rest of them. Why are you so confident that he will pull it off? If he would leave his family for only one monk. We will see. I've lost lots of my best men for his head already. What Nemiao is scared of the most is his reputation. He gathered the best men to fight us. If you're doing this for prestige, you are making a huge mistake. If I don't warn you, Nemiao will be angry. I must ask you to tell Namiao l can do it for sure. Are you sure Phya Thot would dare to betray Mangchai? A bastard like that could do anything. I see you all are here. And I think you all had something to eat. But if today you're still hungry, in the future, you definitely will not be hungry if you all care for each other, just like this firewood. If there is only one stick, the fire will burn out quickly. But when there are many sticks pile up to create a big fire, it takes a longer time to burn. And if we're lucky, the dew falls in tonight and it will take a much longer time to burn, extinguishing much later. Phin, you have to do it. May God bless you. Are you the two... Muen Sena rescued from Bang Putsa? -Yes, Father. -Yes. Because of your virtue, we both are alive. My wife has asked me to pay respect to you. I bring red lime paste to offer you. I made it myself, it's my family heritage. Very well. Luckily, you met Mun and his folks. Seeing that wound... makes me feel sorry for you. -No! Father! -What are you doing? It's... poisoned. Actually, we are not Bang Putsa villagers. The Burmese took my kids... and others as hostages. They forced us... to kill you, Father. Please forgive me, Father. If we don't do it, they will kill our kids and all villagers. Yes. Did you steal something from me? Come here. This is for you. You can have it. My beloved wife. Halt! No news from the prisoners that went to kill the monk. Then kill all of their people! Even those stupid prisoners couldn't do it. But that doesn't mean we can't do it. As soon as Ayutthaya is destroyed, we'll take the Big Golden Buddha to Namiao, and get the monk's head too. Wherever they're staying, we can find them easily. They'll see thousands of our men. Like ants. This is our double luck. Let the people of Phin's village eat. Well, that... Pah, tie that stuff up over there. Come on. Let's eat. Only those from Phin's Village. The rest of you, get back to work. You. Come on. You. You, go! What's so special today? Why Phin's people are getting such fine food? Give me some. Come on, I want some too. How did they ever get food like this? This is the prize for Phin's people. He screwed up a job he did for the general. You bastard! How could you do this, Phin? What's going on? Why do you have to beat them? That couple was trying to poison the monk. Duang saw everything and told me. -Is that true, Tid? -Yes! How is the monk doing? With his prestige, he's doing all right. Kick them out! Hold on. But the monk hasn't been harmed, right? Mun, you're the leader. You can't just give in. -Yes! -Who will be responsible if he’s dead? Mun is not as cold-blooded as you. Are you going to see captives dying -and not help? -We have to think about our capabilities. Being too generous can be bad for you! -Yes. -All right! You can kill me or do whatever you like to me! What did he do wrong to deserve the punishment? They deserted their kids. They let their kids and their people die for me. For what? If you were them, would you be brave enough to do so? You ask yourselves. Ayutthaya is breached! Ayutthaya is breached! What did those two do wrong? Day after day people keep dying like leaves. And how many will die tomorrow? Two? Twenty? Living in hiding, and stealing. Maybe it's the best way to live. But how long can we keep doing this? The Burmese... are all over the place. And they won't go anywhere. They will destroy our motherland. If you don't fight, just abandon everything here and run away. But if you think you're a real warrior, get your weapons... and join my troops tomorrow at dawn. The holy power of the monk... will make this battle... as great... and famous... as the battle of Bang Rajan. Pull harder, everyone. Pull! -Pah, drink some water, son. -No! -I don't drink Burmese water. -You idiot! Come on. Pull! Stupid bitch! Aunty, get out of here. I dreamed that l got killed by the yantric cloth warrior. My mother is sick. Please send a doctor to check her, sir. What are you barking about? I don't understand. My mother... is sick. Shit! The soldiers are ready, sir. Are you staring at my wife? When l ask you, you answer! With such a pretty woman, no man can resist. A poor man like me can only look. Today I’ll let you taste her to celebrate our victory over Ayutthaya. What are you waiting for? Do it now! Hurry up! Hey! I mean you gotta do it right here! Right here! Now! Do it now! Mark my words. Today we conquered Ayutthaya. All women... and everything belongs to us. Mom. Mom. Mom. Mom. Mom. Mom. I told you not to run away. Pah. Pah. Pah! Why did it have to be you? Get out of the way! Thong. Thong, I saw the Burmese soldiers are coming this way. I'm out of here. The Burmese are ruling this country. We'll surely be killed. Where can you go? The Burmese soldiers are everywhere. We're just a small group, it'll be easy to flee. I gathered many good fighters. What do you think? Are you going with me or not? -I'm going. -I'll go too. Tie everything well so they don't fall out on the way. Let's all help. Come on! Hurry up! Mom. Mom. Why didn't you tell me you were leaving the camp? Where are we going? Stop asking questions! I'm in a hurry. Get on the cart! l told you to get on the cart. Didn't you hear me? Forget about her. Let's get going. Maen, have you seen Daeng around? I saw him on guard in front of the camp. Stop. Chaba, it's time to go. Chaba! Chaba! Chaba! Chaba. Chaba. Chaba. -Daeng. -Chaba. I told you... I will marry you. Here. -Prik. -Daeng. You can't change my mother's mind. I want to be with you, but I really can't desert my mother. Chaba... I want you to be my wife in this life. I want to follow you wherever you go. But I can't desert the monk either. Remember my words. After this war, I will look for you. I will follow you everywhere. I'II tie these strings around your wrist. Promise me you'll wait for me. -Promise me! -I'll wait for you. You promised me already. I'll wait for you. I'll wait for you, Daeng. -I'll find you. -I'll wait for you. Daeng. Oh, my dear. Daeng... if you two are meant to be a couple, I think one day you'll definitely be together. Homesick? We've been away from Ayutthaya for months. Don't you miss your home? Here... or wherever we are, it's still our homeland. Nothing is permanent in this world. Even our own bodies... aren't really ours. When we meet our death, our bodies return to the earth. Just think that what we are losing is merely the body. But what really matters is... the story we keep. The story that is still in your heart and soul. When the Bang Rajan village was attacked the villagers grabbed their swords and were not scared to die. They knew in their heart what they were fighting for. Though their bodies were gone, their love for their motherland was eternal. This love is with you forever no matter which battle you fight. What are you really fighting for? I fight for the things I love. What about you, Mun? What do you fight for? Ayutthaya has been destroyed. Which piece of land can you call home? Which piece of land you can die on peacefully? And where... will your body be buried? We can't just run away forever, Mun. Maen, Phan, Kiew and Eang. Get all the villagers around here. I believe there are hundreds of them. With that huge Burmese army out there, who would join us? -Yantric cloth warriors? -Yes. We come to ask you to fight the Burmese. Will you join us? Don't you think it's time for all of us to unite? Why are you sitting here? I know what you're going to do is very important. But if you ask me, I can tell you that I don't care if everyone dies and no one has any land. All l want is for you, me and our child to stay together. Please don't go again. What's so great if there are only the three of us and nobody else? Which land can we really call it our home? Now l understand what I'm fighting for. It's not just for survival. I fight for the future of our children, for them to have their land to live in, and to walk and to play. So they can sleep in peace... and no one can harm them. Chumpee, listen to me. If I don't live to raise him, please tell him... that I didn't go anywhere. I will be in the ground, in the trees and in the river. I will protect him. God bless you, and may you come back victoriously. I believe if you unite your forces like this, you will defeat the enemy and return. Pull! Pull! Pull! Pull! Pull! Pull! Pull! Pull! Pull! Pull! Pull! Pull! Pull! Kill them! Go! Hurry up! Come on! Move it! Go! Run! Come on! Run! Run! Get that rope off and run! Come on! Run! Run! Run! Run! Go! Take the ropes off! Run! Go! Go! Maen! Maen! Go! Go! Move it! Phaya! Phya Thot is escaping! Eang! -Eang! -Muen. Let go! Muen! No! Eang! Eang! Eang! Phya Thot escaped again. Good dharma brings happiness. Bad dharma bringssuffering. Fair dharma brings peace. Places of sensuality with perception. -Maen. -Rejoice in a body is good spirits. Rejoice in a voice is good spirits. Pull! Pull! Pull! Pull! Pull! Pull! Hooray! Hooray! General Suki doesn't want to kill any peasant. No one will die if you hand over Bhikkhu Thammachot. Otherwise, General Suki... won't leave even one cow alive. Your Reverence. -Don't go, Father! -What if they kill my family? -Do you want him to die? -Don't go! Don't go, Father. Please don't go, Father. Don't go. Please don't go, Father. Don't go, Father. Please don't go. -Don't go, Father. -Quiet! Don't you remember my teachings? Your body is not permanent. It's a type of suffering. It's not yours. Everyone will end up the same. No exception. Not even me. -Don't go. -Please don't go. -Don't go. -Don't go, Father. Father, please don't go. Please don't go. Father. Chumpee, get behind the cart. All of you, listen to me! Now, it's time for you to choose. Live or die. If you choose to live, just drop your weapons and surrender. But if choose to die... don't let those weapons slip out of your hands. And follow my orders. l heard that you're invincible. Is it true? Do you know… why are the Bang Rajan villagers so tough? It's because they have been coerced and tortured. If you don't stop, they'll fight you forever. Charge! Fire! Fire! We've been away from Ayutthaya for months. Don't you miss your home? Here... or wherever we are, it's still our homeland. They're not afraid of death as long as they have hope to return to their loved ones. After the war, I'll find some good land... to make a paddy field. I will survive... and I will find you. You'll have to wait for me, Chaba. -You'll have to wait for me. -I will, Daeng. I will. If I don't live to raise him, please tell him that I didn't go anywhere. I will be in the ground, in the trees and in the river. I will protect him. Do you know... why are the Bang Rajan villagers so tough? It's because they have been coerced and tortured. And if you don't stop, they'll fight you forever. Subtitle translation by Chaimas Sainampueng
