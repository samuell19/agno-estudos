It's getting worse. Do you think we should... Ride it out? The longer we stay, the greater the risk. Plus everything we need is already packed. I say we get out while we still can. Okay, I'll just go before we go. I'll wait in the car. Come on, Maisie. Dylan? Stay there, something's off. Hey guys, what's going on? Who are you? Dylan, who are you? Where's Gordo? Who's Gordo? The bloke that lives here. Look, you've got the wrong house. Hey! Christ, Paul! You gotta get me something for this pain! How about another bullet? Patch him up, George. I'm sure Gordo doesn't want us bleeding all over his couch I'm telling you, there's no Gordo here. You've got the wrong house. I think you've got the wrong house, sunshine. What are you, one of Gordo's little tweaker customers chasin' a fix? I don't do drugs. Me neither, I do deals. And I'm here to do one with Gordo, and you're testing my fuckin' patience. Likewise. I'm calling the police. No. You're not. Come on, Paul. You need to get me somethin' for this pain. I'm dyin' here! Yeah, well, die slower, 'cause I'm fucked if I know what half this shit is. You guys aren't paramedics. Don't give him that, that's adrenaline. He'll be bouncing off the fuckin' walls. We'll hit the hospital, Ringo. We'll get a big fat cut each. There'll be hardly anyone there. They'll all be evacuated. And the security will be real light, yeah, right! Clean it with this, wrap it with that. We'll dig the bullet out later. Later? What if it gets infected? Shunk. Fuck off, you're not takin' my leg. Oh, harden up. You've got a spare one. You guys robbed the hospital? What's in the box? Good luck. They won't even tell me. Apparently I'm need to know. You ask a lot of questions. What are you, a narc? Somethin' funny, George? Nah. Just you and your undercover cops. Everywhere we go, you're like, that dude on the skateboard I think he's an undercover cop. Little old lady, undercover cop. Shit, what if Ringo's one of 'em? Took a bullet to keep his cover? Nah, nah, not Ringo. He could never be an undercover cop. Undercover cops are smart. I'm not a cop. Just a regular guy trying to keep out of the storm. I don't give a fuck about the who. I want to know the where. As in where is Gordo? There is no Gordo here. I've never heard of any Gordo, I live here. You're gonna die here. Paul! I thought you said you didn't want to get blood all over Gordo's place? He can deduct the carpet cleaning bill from my score. What if this bloke's telling the truth? What if this is the wrong house? I mean, have you ever actually been to Gordo's place? This is 17 Mermaid Crescent. Correct? This is a note from Gordo, in his own handwriting. Read it out loud. 11 Mermaid Crescent? No, that's a seven, and that looks like a two in front of it. Twenty seven? Yeah, could be. Hard to tell, Paul. It got wet in the rain, ink's a bit fucked. It could be 27, Paul. 27's up the street. There's one way to find out. Yeah, Gordo, it's Paul, ring me. Wait Paul, George, Ringo? What happened to John? He's dead. Texting Gordo. Dear Gordo where the fuck are you? Smiley emoji, send. What? Nothin'. You think I'm a narc now, do you? Well, you suddenly seem very concerned for this bloke's welfare. Yeah, Paul. He's my handler. Ringo's the Police Commissioner. We've been workin' on this sting for years, and we've finally got you. You keep giving me lip, mate, you're gonna need that fuckin' first aid kit. Is that Gordo? Hold on, I'm coming. Man of many words. Still doesn't tell us if we're in the right house. Text him back, ask him for the number. What do you fuckin' think I'm doin'? This is taking too long. There's probably cops out everywhere looking for us. If you want to go, there's the door! What's her name? Who's name? Your woman. Wife, girlfriend, Thai hooker, whatever the fuck she is. I'm single. Whose is this, then? Look, I know we've only just met, but you don't strike me as the pink hoodie type. Oh, man, I didn't even see that. Maybe it's time for an introduction. Call her out, then. Maisie! Come out. Ah, there she is. Come on, don't be shy. We're just having a little getting-to-know-you session here. And I'd like to get to know you. What's your name again, Mercy? Maisie. Maisie, ah I'm Paul, this is George and Ringo. We're all out for the mystery tour. Aw, fuck. What? Sending message failed. I had one bar a minute ago and now I got shit. What are we gonna do? We need to find out for sure which house is fuckin' Gordo's. George, take a walk down the street. See what's goin' on at number 27. In this weather? No, no, wait for the next convenient sunny day. We're gonna stay here, just in case Gordo does turn up. But you, you can go with him. I don't want you two love birds trying to pull some shit while I'm a man down. Man and a half down. After you. George? While you're out, could you grab me something for the pain? There's fuck-all in here. Sure, Ringo. We'll stop at a 7-11, get you some Advil. Cheers. So, Maisie, how's about a cup of tea? Hey mate, is there a Gordo that lives here? Never heard of him. Sorry for bothering you. Hey, do you mind coming in for a sec? My dad's hurt his arm. - Nah, mate, we can't... - No worries. I'm Kev, by the way. Dylan. George. This is my Dad, Trevor. Kev and Trev. How're you going? Christ in a tutu, what brought you blokes out on a night like this? Don't try and get up, Dad. It's only a graze, son, I'm not a cripple yet. It's not just a graze. I think it needs stitches. All it needs is a bit of Mercurochrome, and it'll be like a bought one. I don't think you can get Mercurochrome any more, Dad. Bullshit. Uh, yeah discontinued. Bugger me. So, what did you do to your arm? We were cleaning up the backyard before the cyclone, and a sheet of corrugated iron fell on Dad's arm and slashed him. Can we have a look? Yeah, sure. Oooh. It's okay, son, it doesn't hurt. Yeah, but things can get infected, Dad. It's the tropics, wounds can turn septic. You think I came down in the last shower, son? Last shower, son? I've lived in North Queensland all my bloody life. I've survived more cyclones than you've had hot dinners, and I intend to survive this one. Talking about hot dinners, you blokes hungry? We've got some snags on the gas. Or a drink? We've got our cyclone survival kit ready to go. We'll be fine. Now, uh do you guys have a first aid kit? Down there, just got it out. If youse can deal with the stitches, we've got the anesthetic covered. George, you good? Uh, yeah. Can't see any stitches. Butterfly strips right there. Oh, yeah. They changed the packaging. So you guys ridin' the storm out by yourselves? Yeah, Kev came over to keep me company. My missus and his missus have gone off to Singapore for a shopping holiday. They go twice a year, murder our bloody bank cards, mate. Good timing for this trip. They're missin' out on all the fun. I mean that cyclone's the best thing that ever happened to this street. Aren't you gonna sterilize that? Oh, yeah. There's some rubbing alcohol in the bathroom cupboard, mate. I'll get it, I need to use your loo, anyway. I need to use your loo, anyway. It's just down the hall, chuck a right. Yeah, it's just near the Mercurochrome! Hey, uh, you sure you don't want a snag, mate? So, you're off-duty or something, mate? Yeah, just finished, headin' home. Who's this bloke you're looking for? Gordo? Friend of a workmate. She asked me to drop something off to him. He lives in this street, but I can't remember whether he's 17 or 27. You're a pretty good workmate, coming out on a night like this for her. You find it? Why don't you take over since you're in training? You gonna be an ambo like him, mate? Uh, Doctor. Still a couple of years, though. You would've made a good sawbones. Steady hands. White with one. Thank you, Maisie. Just do me a favor and take a sip of that before you put it down. Just so I know it's not laced with drain cleaner or something. You're nervous. I've never been in a home invasion before. Well, that makes two of us, we're both virgins. Just like Mum used to make. What about me? What about you? You don't drink tea. Something stronger, for the pain. It's fuckin' bad, Paul, you got no idea. Could you please oblige Ringo with some of that bourbon? Might keep him quiet for a while. And no ice. It takes up too much room in the glass. They'd better be back soon, or they won't be goin' anywhere. Hurry up. You must be worried about your man. Out there, in the elements. He can take care of himself. You first. Come on, Ringo. If she's gonna poison anyone, it's gonna be me. You're not high enough up the food chain. I can't drink bourbon. Even the smell of it makes me sick. Tough shit, do it. See, Ringo, we can trust her. Bit of super glue would probably have done the bloody trick, mate, but, uh, thank you. I appreciate it. Well, we're always on call. Uh, George, you mind getting me some medical tape from the first aid kit? Thanks. Gettin' hairy out there. Gettin' bloody dry in here. Now, make sure you check on this as often as you can. Make sure the infection hasn't set in. Check it as often as you can. Yeah, they reckon it's gonna be a category four. And they're sayin' it's gonna hit right about here. - Good as new. - Thank you, mate. We'd better get going. You sure you fellows don't want a snag? Or a beer, one for the road? No thanks. You blokes be careful out there. Hey, do you guys know much about what happened at the hospital earlier? Heard somethin' on the radio about a robbery. No, no, don't know anything about that. But didn't you fellows just come from there? Kev, come and get your old man some dinner. Let these fellows get on the road, eh? I've got four rounds left. One of youse is gonna die twice. Whoa whoa whoa whoa. It's alright, mate. Calm down, have a beer. Kev! You bastard! So how much is rent on a place like this? We're not renting, we bought it. Yeah? Must've been pretty pricey, right on the beach. Million-dollar view. Let me guess he's I.T., you're... marketing? Every chick your age seems to be into fuckin' marketing these days. Dylan's Dad's in real estate, so we got a good deal. Ah, family connection. There's three ways to make money in this life, work for it, inherit it, or steal it. I was born poor and impatient. Yeah, I don't blame you, these are crap. Couldn't get my regular brand. The supermarket had sold out. That's what pisses me off about cyclones. Every time one comes along, all the idiots out there strip the shops. Bottled water, tinned food, smokes. They panic, because they're unprepared. It's like when someone realizes they're about to die. They shit 'emselves. But what's the big surprise? We're all gonna die. We know we are. Could happen at any moment. Could have a heart attack, get hit by a truck, buy a ticket on the wrong plane. These things happen to people all the time all over the world, and I bet they spend their last few seconds shit-scared. Fuck that. I've always believed that if you live every minute prepared to die, it's amazing how alive you feel. I think the best way to feel alive is to try not do things that might kill you. Where the fuck are they? They shouldn't be taking this long. Where the fuck are you goin'? I feel sick. Well, spew in the sink. I have to pee too. I'm not doing that in the sink. You'll do what I tell you to do. Well, I'll hold on. Alright, you can go, but I'll wait outside. Partly open. Dylan, you've got 10 seconds to be at the back door, or they're gonna be her last! Ten, nine, eight, seven, six five, four, three, two, one. Where the fuck is George? What happened out there? Where's George? Talk to me! He cut me loose. Bullshit George wouldn't do that. He would if he was a cop. He's not a cop. You sure? I've known George for years. It takes years to gain someone's trust. That's what deep-cover cops do. And he was so deep cover you didn't even suspect. Fuck that, you're lying. And you got blood on you. For all I know, you fuckin' killed him. I was clipped by a tree branch. George wasn't involved. I'm telling you the truth. George said he had to go meet up with his team. He told me to go get this checked out. I had to come back for Maisie. I'm not gonna let her get caught in the crossfire. The fuck you talking talking about crossfire? The cops. They're coming, now. A fuckin' army, to take you down, you and Ringo. You should get out while you still can. Take my car, it's got a full tank of gas, it's ready to go. I'll hand you my keys, just take it. Ringo! Ringo! I fuckin' knew it. Your girlfriend did fuckin' drug him. You two are a royal fuckin' pain in my arse! Fuck. - What? - Cops. Really? Wake her up. She's out cold. Give her the adrenaline in the first aid kit. Now! Do it! Psst, inject her! It's your turn to pretend you're someone you're not. Off you go, happy smiley. Wait! Over there, bring it here. Do not drop it, don't shake it, and for fuck's sake don't open it. Move. May we come in? Thank you, miss. It's not ideal conditions out there for a chat. Sergeant Wexler, Constable Grace. We're just going door to door to see if anyone's seen an ambulance around in the area tonight. An ambulance? Yes, the hospital was robbed and the perpetrators fled in a stolen ambulance. We've had some calls from people in the neighborhood who saw one driving around here tonight. Have you been in all night, miss? Uh, yeah. Just trying to keep safe. Are you alone? Um, my fiancé was here, then he went out to get some ice. He'll be back, soon. I'm sorry, miss, can I get your name, please? Maisie. Maisie. Maisie Carter. Carter. Have you seen an ambulance drive down this street this evening with no flashing lights, no siren, just driving? Um no, sorry, I don't think I have. Are you alright, miss? Uh, yeah, I'm fine. I just drank something I shouldn't have. Dilated pupils, slurred speech. Some of the men we're looking for have affiliations with drug dealers in this area. You wouldn't know anything about that, would you? No, I don't do drugs. I never have. Then you wouldn't mind if Constable Grace had a quick look around while I keep you company? Sure go ahead. Normally we wouldn't be out on a night like this, we'd be trying to find shelter like everyone else. But the men that robbed the hospital, they shot and killed a security guard. That man had a family, a wife and children. They won't see him tonight. They won't see him ever again. So you can understand that we would prefer they didn't get through the net. What did they steal? That's not your concern. What should be your concern is that one of the men has had convictions for sexual assault. Now, these men are hardened criminals, Maisie. I don't want to see them around a vulnerable young woman on a night like this. Um, you know, come to think of it, um I thought I saw an ice cream truck driving by earlier but it could've been an ambulance, you know. It's hard to tell. Constable, let's go! Please take care of yourself. You too. Down! Uh uh uh uh. You call for backup, he dies. You shoot me, he dies. You don't drop that in five seconds, he dies. He likes countdowns. If I've got five seconds, you've got three seconds, fuck-knuckle. Drop the hardware, or you're gonna join your friend at the hospital in the morgue. - Constable! - Ringo! Grace? Looks like you're outgunned, Sergeant. Sorry. It's okay. What have I said? We do not kill cops. Doesn't mean we can't rough 'em up a bit, though. Thanks a lot, now I've got a headache. You asked for a drink. Didn't say how strong you wanted it. So what's your boss gonna do with that cop? Fucked if I know. He told me to stay here and watch you two. So that's what I'm doing. So what do you thinks in the box? I dunno, man Gordo's a drug dealer it's probably oxy or somethin'. Who cares? We're gonna get paid big bucks for it, that's all that matters. Paul's gonna get paid big bucks for it. You're probably just gonna get a bullet. You shot a cop. You're a liability, mate. Don't try that Jedi-mind-trick bullshit on me. It won't work. Now stop askin' fucking questions. One more question. A question you probably should ask yourself. Why would it take four blokes to steal something from a hospital that one bloke could steal from some pharmacy? Obviously whatever's in the box is worth much more than just some shit hillbilly heroin. I'll put you in a fuckin' box if you don't shut up. Why can't you just let us go? Thanks, I gave them up in '98. You don't remember me, do you? I've been a cop since you were knocking back titty milkshakes, son, so please forgive me if I don't remember every rev-head, pot-head, cokehead and fuckhead that came across my blotter. Let me refresh your memory. You're a sales rep for Yellow Pages? About a year ago, downtown, you had me in for questioning over a rape charge. You were convinced I was your man. No, sorry, I've got nothin'. Six hours, we went around and around. You and me and one of these. Your interrogation aid, that's what you called it. Now, I'd heard about cops using phone books to beat confessions out of suspects before, but I thought it was just an urban myth. Something those TV cop shows made up. But when I looked at myself in the mirror later, I was like, bugger me, it's true. Phone books really don't leave bruises. So that's why you've got me all trussed up? So you can whale on me for traumatizing you with a phone book? Okay, well, it's your wingding. But please, mind the nose. I don't want to lose my Justin Bieber good looks. Oh, no, I don't hold a grudge, Sarge. I just want to find out for myself how effective these are for extracting information. Oh, well, if you want my mother's secret chicken cacciatore recipe, I can tell you now it's gonna be a long night. Let's see how funny you are after a couple more hours of that, eh? Son, you have no idea what interrogations are like in North Korea, Burma, shitholes like that. They use electric power tools, rats, liquid nitrogen. I used the velvet glove on you. Yeah, well no gloves on tonight, old-timer. Now, you can make this stop at any time. Just answer three simple questions. Is there a mole in my crew, are there more cops coming here now, and what do you know about Gordo? You might as well be speaking North Korean, son. I have no fuckin' idea what you're talking about. Yeah, well you're right about one thing right, Sarge. It's gonna be a long night. Hard to say where's more dangerous out there or in here. Dylan, did you kill George? No. I guess you could say his life choices did. You go down paths that seem like they'll lead you to better places, and then you realize you've gone down a dead end. And the worst thing is you've dragged everybody down with you. You're not responsible for what's happening out there. We should've left when you wanted to. And I hesitated. If we'd have gone just a few minutes earlier... Maisie regrets will not get us out of here. We have to get ourselves out of here. Any ideas? Not yet, you? Maybe. That's a surprisingly good workout. You feel it in the arms. Do this a couple times a week, you'd have guns like Arnie in his prime in no time. Here's an easy one for you, Sarge. What's your favorite Schwarzenegger movie? Or just favorite movie in general? It's not Shawshank Redemption, is it? Oh, thank fuck for that. You just scored some points in my book, Sarge. That is such a cliched favorite movie. Not the movie itself, but having it as your favorite movie. But, like, you ask 10 people, and, I swear to God, fuckin' seven of them will say it's the best movie they've ever seen. Look, it's good, but it's not that good. It's no The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, or Seven Road Warrior, Dawn of the Dead. It's just so unoriginal having that as your favorite. It's like having fuckin' vanilla as your favorite ice cream. But you ask people, you call them out and they say oh, no, it's got such a feel-good ending. Fuckin' wake up, people. Life doesn't have feel-good endings. There's no escape from all the shit. No beach, no old boat. My colleague, John died at the hospital today. Right in the middle of the job. Security guard capped him, center mass, down he went. We'd been working together for years. No feelgood ending there. And I'm startin' to think, Sarge, that there isn't gonna be one for you either. Now, my little mate in there, he's already killed a cop, so whether he kills another one or not, they're gonna throw the book at him anyway. He's already tainted. And it doesn't make any difference to me if he does. And he will kill you if I ask him to. He's an obedient little mutt. All you have to do is answer my questions and I promise I'll keep him muzzled. Fine, clam up, bunker down. A couple more hours of this and you'll be begging for a bullet. What was that? It's hunker down, not bunker down. Bunker's a noun, not a verb. Oh my mistake. Maybe I should be using a dictionary instead. You know, you remind me of my Dad. I hated the prick. You fuckin' useless turd. Shit, don't go anywhere. What the fuck? How's the headache? Plenty of candles here. You and the missus ever get freaky in the bedroom? Ever use any hot wax? Next time check me for a spare set of keys, you useless fucking turd. Are you sure you're okay? Yeah, nothing a couple of aspirin and a shot of Scotch wouldn't fix. Sergeant, Maisie and I were wondering if we could just go and leave you to sort out the rest of this. Go? Out in that? Yeah, we were just wanting to get away for a while. You know, clear our heads. Not possible, I'm sorry. There's statements to be taken, questions to be answered. You two are part of this now. Have you called for backup? I can't. Lines are down, and they smashed the radios. What about the radio in your car? You two are a bit young, I think, to remember Cyclone Andy, back in the summer of '81, I think it was. Had the same intensity as this one. I was just a rookie, you know, green as grass. The day after the storm, I was helping with the cleanup. We found this bloke in his backyard. I mean, Jesus Christ, what would you be doing out in the middle of a cyclone? A star picket piece of metal that was like this big, had gone through his chest and out his back. The wind had been so strong, it had driven this piece of steel right through him. Staked him like a fuckin' vampire. So, in answer to your question, no, I won't be going out to my car. I'll be waiting for the eye. The eye? Every cyclone has an eye. It's a calm center that has no wind, clear skies. Lasts about I dunno, five minutes. By the sound of it, this bastard's gonna make landfall soon. I'd say probably within the next hour. The eye'll be close by. Meanwhile, I'm gonna go and have a little chat to your visitors. You two better find yourself a pack of cards. Sergeant? I'm sorry about your partner. Not as sorry as they're gonna be. You mentioned a movie to me earlier. Dawn of the Dead. I saw parts of it a long time ago. I didn't like it. I don't mind the odd horror movie, but I prefer a movie that doesn't show you everything, so you have to use your imagination to fill in the gaps. Much more scary. I remember seeing a movie when I was a kid. It was an old one, black and white, way before your time. They had this lady swimming in an indoor pool. It was night, not a lot of light. And there was this jungle cat, a black panther, I believe. I'm not sure, but it was in the room with her, and it was creeping around through the shadows. You couldn't see it, but you could hear it. Oh, man I didn't sleep for a week after that. Not being able to see what's happening, only hearing it, is the most powerful way to elicit fear. Those interrogators from the countries I told you about earlier you know, North Korea, Burma, even the Yanks at Guantanamo they use blindfolds on their victims, because it intensifies the whole experience. Ah, Paul Roberts, AKA Paul Wilson, AKA Paul Donovan, AKA Paul Jones. A man of many aliases but only one face. A face that is very hard to forget. Yeah, oh yeah I remember you. You were my number one person of interest in that rape case. I wanted to bring you in for a second round with the phone book, but you went off the grid when we let you walk. I am so really, really glad that you came back on my grid tonight. If I had my way, I would never have let you walk. I would've had you dead to rights. Unfortunately, the victim was thrown into a creek and the water washed off a lot of the physical evidence. The tests were inconclusive. Plus he wore a balaclava, so she couldn't identify his face. And we never got our guy. She survived the incident but she was never the same again. I mean, you couldn't blame her, she was raped, beaten, thrown from a bridge into a saltwater creek, and left to die with a broken arm. Her skin burnt by the sun, covered in mosquito bites and leeches. It's lucky a crocodile didn't... Seven months, seven months after that night, she took her own life. Two weeks before her 21st birthday. Rose Olivia Wexler, my daughter. Paul, don't insult me by trying to deny it. You have a history of aggravated assault. Violence against women. Now, you were in Cairns at that time. You have no alibi for that night. A new piece of evidence came to light after you went underground. Rose, as she got her memory back she remembered a distinct animal from that night. A walrus, goo goo gajoob. You know, I don't know why the North Koreans and all those crazy fucks have to use all that weird and wonderful machinery to torture people when all you need is a standard Swiss army knife. It has everything. Look, it's got a corkscrew. It also has a saw blade, a file you know, even the tweezers, they could come in handy. Paul, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but I'm not interested in asking you any questions. I'm interested in you suffering. And twist. You know he's torturing them. It's not our problem. He's a cop, he can't do that. I don't really care what he does to them. I'm worried about what he's doing to himself. Let's get out of here. How? He's distracted. We'll just slip outside, jump in the car and go. It's too dangerous out there. He is dangerous, Maisie! I'll go in there and I'll talk to him... Talk him down off the ledge? He's already jumped. And we're witnesses. I'll get the car, I'll bring it out to the door. All you need to do is jump in. No, no, please don't go out there. Hey trust me, I'd rather not. But I think we need to have our candlelit evening somewhere else. Come on What's wrong? Well, the bad news is our battery's dead. The good news is, there's a perfectly good ambulance out there. You want to steal a stolen ambulance? Do you remember which one of them had the keys? If it's either one of those two, we've got a good chance. You distract Wexler and I'll look through their pockets. What if George had the keys? We're fucked. Tough guy, eh, impervious to pain? I may have to step it up. I'm going to take the tape off your mouth. If you try to spit at me or bite me, the tape goes back on and I begin to head south. Do you get my drift? Nod your head if you get my drift. Wexler, you crazy fuck! You're never gonna work as a cop again after this! There's no jury that would convict me for torturing the man who raped my daughter. That's what I was trying to tell you, arsehole, I didn't fuckin' do it! Oh, right, that's pure coincidence that you have a tattoo of the same animal that she remembered. John had the same tattoo! We got matching ones! Do your fuckin' research! I did. I know that you and your dead associate have the same tattoo. Thing is, he was out of town the night it happened. I've seen all of the video footage that proves it. Don't try to pin what you did on your dead sidekick. Be a man, and take the consequences. Alright, look, look, I'll tell you about Gordo. What do you want to know? The guy's a fence. He mainly does drugs but he moves other shit as well. He was supposed to meet us here at seven to do the deal Paul! He was gonna sell it to some black market dudes. Paul! They were gonna pay him top dollar for it. He was gonna pay us top dollar for it. He's the guy you want. Paul! I don't care about Gordo. I only want to know one thing. Is it safe? What? Never mind. I'm sorry, Paul, there is no happy gas. Sergeant? You shouldn't be here. Please stop. I'm not sure I can. Can you honestly say this is making you feel better? Yes. No. I don't know. You're not like them. You're a policeman. You're supposed to be good uphold the law. The law failed her. I failed her, my poor Rosie. What the fuck are you doing? Making sure you're not giving these guys heart attacks. You're no more a paramedic than they are. And what the fuck do you care if these shitbags die? I don't, but not in our house. You should be lucky I'm in your house. I'm between you and this filth. If I wasn't here, you'd be dead, and they'd be taking turns with your girlfriend. There's a line between enforcing the law and police brutality. Police brutality. We're on the streets day and night. We're being yelled at, we're being spat at, we're being pissed on, we're being shot at and we're being stabbed. Do you know all the shit that goes down that never gets into the news? You ever seen a baby's head crushed by a stepfather high on ice? Or a beaten mother nearly decapitated by hedge trimmers? No, you sit here in your middle-class bubble playing Grand Theft Auto. You think that's your walk on the wild side. What happens when the wild side walks in through your front fuckin' door? Your daughter wouldn't want to see you like this. You have no fucking idea what my daughter would want. You know what? I've changed my mind. You want out of here so bad? I'll fucking help you! Yoo-hoo, loverboy? You might want to get Wexler's gun and handcuff keys real soon, or Blondie here's gonna feel the power between my legs. Do it or I crush her fuckin' larynx! Give me the gun and keys. Don't do it, he's gonna kill us all. Give me the keys! Right, now put the gun in my hand and get me out of all this shit. I promise I'll play nice. Harder than you think to kill someone, isn't it? Let me make it easier for you. Ask yourself the question, who do you trust more? Me or him? I did what you asked. Now let her go. Aw ain't love grand? Alright, Ringo, time to get the band back together. I'll thank you to slide that piece across the floor, or I'll snap his neck like a fuckin' twig. I didn't touch your daughter. But you can ask her that yourself. What the fuck? Man, you could've killed me! Bitch, bitch, bitch. That's all I've heard from you all night. I thought you said you didn't kill cops. I thought you said a whole army of 'em were comin' here. Since when do two cops make an army? Tell me what really happened to George. What's happening? Is this? The eye, it's the calm in the middle of the storm. Fuckin' trippy. Is someone out there? Is that? Yeah, that's George. What the fuck happened to him? Good question, let's find out. You go outside, get George, bring him back in. That's a suicide mission. This'll only last for a few minutes and then it's gonna come back worse than before. They could both be killed. That's why I'm staying here with Ringo and you, to make sure she doesn't take off. Clock's ticking, Blondie. Oh, man, the sky is green, the fucking sky is green. Is that normal? You can't tell me that's normal. Shut up, she's nearly there. You, your fuckin' boyfriend. Awwww, fuck! What is she doing? Never send a woman. Can't I go and help her? You stay right fuckin' here. It's comin' back. Come on, baby, nearly there. Well done, blondie! I had my doubts, but you delivered the goods. Welcome back from the dead, George. Now let's have a little chat about what happened earlier. George, what happened when you and this bloke went down the street? Did he shoot you, can you speak? George? Fucker tried to get a message to the neighbors. Don't trust him. Don't believe anything he says. It's okay, mate. You've just confirmed what I already suspected. No, wait! He's the one you shouldn't trust. Get out of the way, Blondie. I don't want to have to shoot through you, ruin that lovely rack. Listen, when you were texting Gordo earlier, he was on his phone typing behind your back. And a few seconds later, you get a text from Gordo. Now, you think that's a coincidence? Whoa, are you saying George is Gordo? No way, I've met Gordo. George is George, Gordo is Gordo. And you two are cactus. George was pretending to be Gordo. He's got Gordo's phone because he's a cop, and the cops have arrested Gordo. You lying bitch! Nah, that's the same shit he tried to spin earlier. I didn't believe it then, I don't believe it now. Check his phone, and check sent messages. And if I'm lying, then fine, kill us. Kill 'em anyway, Paul! We should've capped the both of 'em when we first got here! George give us your phone. Are you fuckin' kidding me? You really gonna believe this lyin' bitch? Just give us your phone, and we'll put this to bed once and for all. I didn't bring my phone in case I lost it, and they traced it back to me. What's that in your pocket? I don't... Ringo. That's not mine. That is not mine. They put that there. They fuckin' planted that on me! Hold on I'm coming, and a missed call from me. Paul, I am telling you, I am not a cop. Now I don't have to wonder anymore. Ringo, grab our shit. Soon as this dies down, we're off. We'll find ourselves another Gordo. Well it's been real, it's been fun, but I wouldn't say it's been real fun. One last thing, one last thing. What type of organ is it? Come again? In the box, what type of organ did you guys steal? I mean, it is an organ, isn't it? For Gordo to be offering such a high price? So what type is it? Heart, liver, new leg? A new leg? What do you? He's not the only one back from the dead, fuck-knuckle! Ringo kill him, kill 'em all! Good boy, now finish the job. John was right. We never should've hired you. Let me show you how it's done. I am sick of you bossing me around. Treating like shit, like I'm stupid. Keeping me in the dark about everything. And you know what? I'm sick of you taking all the credit. You and John, you were so tight, best mates. You never wanted me in your team. I never felt like I belonged, so I went and got this. And you didn't know about it. I had a secret that you didn't know about, Mr. big-time smartarse. You and his daughter? Yeah, she was pretty sweet. And I'm gonna do the same to her. After I take care of one more thing. No, Ringo don't open it. I'm done takin' orders from you, Paul. Oh, and by the way out of you and John, I much preferred John. I wonder what Santy brought me, and I can't wait 'till Christmas morning to open it. Go, run. Where youse goin'? Don't you want to stick around and see what the genius criminal mastermind Paul got us mastermind Paul got us to take from the hospital? No, aw, come on. Must be good if we're all gonna get paid big bucks for it. Well, some of us, anyway. Ringo? I'm no genius, but I know when it's best to leave well enough alone. Shut up, Paul. You're not the boss of me anymore. I'll find my own buyer for this. If you're looking for a buyer, you need to know what product you're selling. Do you know what Cesium-137 is, Ringo? It's a radioactive isotope. Hospitals use it in their radiotherapy departments. They treat cancer with it. And apparently you can use it to make a dirty bomb. Gordo had some guys lined up. Guys with bushy beards. I don't know what they were planning, but they were going to pay handsomely for some Cesium-137. Problem with the Cesium-137 is, if it's not stored and handled properly, it's highly unstable. And if you shake it up too much, it can go critical. And if it goes critical... It's beautiful. You say goodbye. We'll just get what we came for and go. Even being here right now is risky. Badass, baby. You ready? Bit early, aren't youse? Avon calling! What're you doing in my house? Are you alone? Yeah, why? Are you Gordo? Yeah, why? Put all your drugs and cash in there. Who are you people? Someone we both cared for died of an overdose from drugs that you sold. Okay, maybe they shouldn't have taken them. Her drink was spiked at a nightclub! And we traced it back to you. Look, I'm just a retailer, okay? I can't control what... Shut up and fill the bag! I can't, I can't do it. Find another line of work, scumbag, 'cause if you keep dealing drugs we know where you live. You understand? Good, here's a reminder. Dear Gordo, where the fuck are you? Smiley emoji, send. Is that Gordo? Hold on, I'm coming. What is she doing? Never send a woman. If you shake it up too much it can go critical. And if it goes critical. We did it, little sis. I love you, and I miss you. Well, it's safe to say Gordo's little business has been, uh, liquidated. Him too. It was nice of him to bankroll our permanent overseas holiday before he went. You don't think we'll get radiation poisoning, do you? Well if we do, consider these medicinal. Why, how do you feel? I feel, good.
