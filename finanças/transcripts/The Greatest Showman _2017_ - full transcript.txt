Uh, if I may, sir, I believe I have skills and ideas that go well beyond punching numbers into an adding machine. Well, I've read about this German fellow, Lilienthal, I believe, who's developed a glider that can take a man in the air, sir. Isn't that amazing? I mean, if you were to apply that to this business, - it would be revolutionary. - Gentlemen! Can I have your attention? You're all dismissed. Bankrupt? I thought the company had a dozen trading ships. Yes, at the bottom of the South China Sea. Typhoon sank 'em all.

But I have everything I want. What about the magic? What do you call those two girls? (BOTH LAUGHING) Hey, you partners, look who moseyed into the corral. Daddy! - PHINEAS: Come here! - Did you bring a present? - A present for what? - (LAUGHING) - For my birthday! - Your what? - My birthday. - It's not your birthday. Okay, I do have a present... but not just any present. Oh, no. The most amazing birthday present ever. This extraordinary machine was originally created by Leonardo da Vinci, 400 years ago. But the blueprints had been lost for centuries until just last week, on a stormy night, when a sunken pirate ship washed up on the shores of Nantucket. They found skeletons and treasures and the blueprints were recovered by none other than J.W. Mercantile. The blueprints crossed my desk very briefly but I managed to commit them to memory. And if I have remembered correctly... Happy birthday, Caroline. This is a wishing machine. You tell it your wishes... and it keeps them safe until they come true. Even if you forget them, they're always there. Can I tell a wish? Step right up. Go ahead. I wish to marry Santa Claus. (CHUCKLES) That is a good wish. I wish... for ballet slippers. Hey, that's» that's a good wish, too. What's your wish, Mommy? I wish... for happiness like this forever for you and you... and for your father. Boring! - (PHINEAS LAUGHS) - CHARITY (LAUGHS): Boring?

(DOOR OPENS) - Charles, we're leaving. - Huh? This bank only wants to lend money to people with money. What are you looking at, flop-doodle? Mr. Barnum. This venture you propose is risky and somewhat bizarre. It's a good bet is what it is, sir. People don't want to admit it... but they're fascinated with the exotic and the macabre. It's why we stare at it. The bank is going to need substantial collateral. Of course. I, uh-- I wouldn't suggest otherwise. The deed and title to my entire flotilla of trading vessels. CHARITY: Why would a bank loan us $10,000? Because we put up collateral. But, dear, we don't have any collateral. Sure we do. In the South China Seas. CHARITY: In the South China Seas? Deep in the South China Seas. (LAUGHS) CHARITY: And what did we buy with this loan? "Barnum's American Museum of Curiosities." What kind of museum is it? (LAUGHS) A place to be transported. A place where people can see things they've never seen before. Huh? - Wax figures? - Yeah. Yeah. They're all the rage in Europe. Look. Marie Antoinette with the sore throat. Napoleon. Come here. See? You've already met some of the most famous folks in history. But they're not all wax. This is the great... O'Malley. Master of sleight of hand. A king of deception. You don't look like a magician. I'm a thief. A very good thief. I caught him nicking my watch. - (SPITS) - (COIN CLATTERS) - See? - An elephant! PHINEAS: Not just any elephant. I can get you somethin' real nice. Just say the word. CHARITY: Oh. Thank you. Oh, yeah. This is a ten-ton bull straight from the plains of Africa. - And look at that. - (LAUGHING) The tallest giraffe in the world. CAROLINE: Can I climb up its leg? - Absolutely not. Okay. - (GIGGLING) Now... I know how it looks. If you didn't, I'd be worried. I mean, it just needs a little work, but... The loan has to be paid back every month. Oh, yeah, we're gonna pay it. We just need customers. - Hundreds of them. - We're gonna get them. (ALL LAUGHING) Welcome to the Barnum Museum. It is one hour of your time, sir, but it will change your life. - We have shows on the hour every hour. - I love your dress. Surely not for the faint of heart, but I can tell you're gonna love it. Half price for anyone who's wearing a hat. Ho, ho! That's you, sir. - Welcome to the Barnum Museum. - (SIGHS) (HORSE NEIGHS) MAN: Load of garbage. WOMAN: Goodness, no. It's rubbish. Welcome to the Barnum Museum, where everyone's special... How many tickets? - Three. - Three. (SIGHS) CAROLINE: Daddy. Daddy. Did you sell any more tickets today? A few. Yeah. Most everyone was rushing home, it's Friday, but... we sold a few. I think you have too many dead things in your museum, Daddy. Do you? She's right. You need something alive. Go to sleep, both of you. Something sensational. That's a big word. It's your word. Something that isn't stuffed. - Like a mermaid. - Or a unicorn. CAROLINE: Unicorns aren't real. HELEN: Well, mermaids aren't real either. (DOG BARKING) You must be Gertrude Stratton. I'm looking for your son. I don't have a son. The hospital record says you do. Charles, right? Age 22? GERTRUDE: Charles! Charles! (DOOR UNLOCKING) P.T. Barnum, at your service. I am putting together a show and I need a star. You want people to laugh at me. Well, they're laughing anyway, kid, so might a♪ well get paid. I see a soldier, no, a general riding across the stage with a sword and a gun, and-- and-- and the most beautiful uniform ever made. People will come from all over the world, and when they see him, they won't laugh. (DOOR OPENS) They'll salute. II' How's it looking, girls? MAN: Hey! You looking for freaks?

Tell me, Mr. Barnum, does it bother you that everything you're selling is fake? Do these smiles seem fake? It doesn't matter where they come from. The joy is real. So, you are a philanthropist? Well, hyperbole isn't the worst crime. Men suffer more from imagining too little than too much. The creed of a true fraud. Mr. Bennett, when was the last time you smiled or had a good laugh? Like a real laugh? A theater critic who can't find joy in the theater. Now who's a fraud? Oh, Mr. Bennett. That word you used to describe my show? Has a nice ring to it. - (GIGGLING) - And right this way. Don't you think there's enough blind trust in my life? Well, isn't that what makes it fun? Keep coming. Okay. Are you ready? - CHARITY: Is it? - PHINEAS: It is. Come on. Let's go. Push. - Oh. - Wow. Helen, that's for you. (GASPS) And, Caroline, this is for you. There's a ballet school right down the street. Just past your parents' house, actually. Don't tell me you bought this house just to rub my parents' noses in your success? Well, that wasn't the only reason. This is the life I promised you. Shall we? Phin... it's beautiful, but you know, we don't need all of this to be-- - (LAUGHS) - PHINEAS: It only took me 25 years, but... welcome home, Charity Barnum. (CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYS) (APPLAUSE) (INDISTINCT MURMURING) - Hello, there. - MAN: There goes Barnum. PHINEAS: Hey, sweetheart, who's that young man over there? Oh, that's Phillip Carlyle. A bit of a scandal, they say. His last play was a hit in London. - Play? - Mmm. You pay good money to watch people stand around and talk for two hours, and they call me a con man. Ew, what's that smell? Do you smell that? Ew. Something does smell. Oh, I know what it is. Peanuts. (GIRLS SNICKERING) I can see it right now. "Youngest prima ballerina in the history of the City Ballet." I'm quitting. What? Why would you quit? I started too late. I'll never catch up. Caroline, you were the best dancer on that stage. What? You think I can't spot talent? Ballet takes years of hard work. It's not like the circus. You can't just fake it. She can't quit. No. No, I mean, she just... She just feels out of place with the other girls. Well, I should certainly hope so. I've never seen so many little prima Donnas in my life. Yeah, but those prima Donnas are the most important thing in the world to her right now. She'll learn to ignore them just like I did. She shouldn't have to. New York society will never accept us. If they did, they'd have to stop judging and actually do something with their lives. This isn't about me. Oh. So it's different than everything else then? I just want her to be proud of who she is, of her family. She is proud. We don't have to be the Carlyles. Mr. Carlyle. You produced this play? Yes, I did indeed. Refunds are available at the front box office. (CHUCKLES) P.T. Barnum. From the circus? Yes. You-- you've been? (CHUCKLES) God, no. But I have seen the crowds. People leave your shows a great deal happier than when they came in, which is much more than I can say for my play. And yet, you have no trouble selling tickets. That's because I'm selling virtue. Can I buy you a drink? I wanna go after the carriage trade. Present legitimate acts, expand our appeal, go after the snobs. If you only knew how suffocating they are. So come join the circus. You clearly have a flair for show business. Teach me how to appeal to the highbrows. - Are you serious? - Mm-hmm. Mr. Barnum, I can't just run off and join the circus. Why not? Sounds thrilling, doesn't it? (TAPS BAR) Let's just say that I find it much more comfortable admiring your show from afar. Comfort, the enemy of progress. Do you understand that just associating with you could cost me my inheritance? Oh, it could cost you more than that. You'd be risking everything. But, on the other hand, well, you just might find yourself a free man.

Go home, you freaks! Freaks! PHINEAS: "Shame of the city." "The protests cement Mr. Barnum's reputation as a purveyor of the offensive and indecent." "Offensive and indecent." Mr. Bennett, I am blushing. HELEN: No, I'm blushing. (GIGGLING) WOMAN: What do you care what Bennett thinks? - LETTIE: He's a prig. - And a snob. Yeah, and all the snobs in New York read him. He does their thinking for them. Whatever happened to thriving off controversy? Yeah, well-- hey. - Do you have any thoughts on this? - HELEN: Phillip! You know what? As a matter of fact, I do. - Helen, come on. - (HELEN GIGGLES) "The Master of the Household "has it in command of the Queen "to invite Mr. Phineas T.

Singer, huh? She's the most famous performer in all of Europe. She's sold out La Scala a dozen times. Not to mention the French Opera. Ah. - What are you doing? - Following you, - so you can introduce me to Miss Lind. - PHILLIP: Introduce you? - PHINEAS: Yeah. - PHILLIP: I don't know her. Everybody knows her. You just said so yourself. Yeah, exactly. You don't just march up to someone like this. Why not? We're personable. She's a person. (PHINEAS CLEARS THROAT) Miss Lind. My name is Phillip Carlyle. And this extraordinary gentleman next to me... Phineas Taylor Barnum. The pleasure's mine. Of course, you are the American. I believe I might have heard of you. Oh, well, if you've heard of me all the way over here, I must be doing something right. That, or something very wrong. Well, in the world of publicity, there's hardly a difference. I believe those are the words of a scoundrel, Mr. Barnum. A showman, Miss Lind, just a showman. The best on my side of the Atlantic. Well, if you do say so yourself. I do, but I don't have to. - Oh, no. No. - Right? No, he is one of the best. Oh, that's very kind of you. Miss Lind... let me get to the point. I'd like to bring you to New York. And if you agree, I'll make you the most famous singer not in Europe, but in the entire world. Mmm. And have you heard me sing? - Absolutely. - No. No, I haven't. But like mine, your reputation precedes you, and, well, I trust your reputation more than my own taste, so... I've never been to America. You will sing in the grandest theater with the finest orchestra in the greatest city on Earth. "Jenny Lind. "One night only." - (LAUGHS) - Or maybe two. And at 20 percent of the gate, it'll be a queen's ransom for your efforts. I give most of my earnings to charity, Mr. Barnum. To orphans and widows. "Voice of a Nightingale, Heart of an Angel." That's brilliant. I mean, the press will go crazy for that story. That's not a story. May I ask you something, Mr. Barnum? Anything. Why me? People come to my show for the pleasure of being hoodwinked. Just once, I'd love to give them something real. MAN: Miss Lind. Everyone is here. Look at this. Even the Winthrops. Are you happy? I will be if this works. Oh, God. I hope she can sing. PHINEAS: What's taking her so long? They're still taking their seats. - Speaking of which. - Yeah? Tom and Lettie, the others, they've just arrived. - What? - (AUDIENCE MURMURING) Where should I put 'em? Your box? That box? No, no, no, that's a bit visible. - Visible? - The acoustics are actually better in the standing room. That's where they should be. Miss Lind's ready now. Okay. Thank you, thank God! This is so awesome. -Isn't it wonderful? - Yeah. - I love it. - Look at the curtain. (CONDUCTOR TAPPING BATON) (AUDIENCE QUIETS) Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your patience. MAN: He's out of his element. MAN 2: What is this about? MAN 3: Is that Barnum? WOMAN: This isn't the circus. I recently had the privilege of hearing the most divine voice I've ever heard. Suddenly, he's a connoisseur. PHINEAS: Now, I know that sounds like Barnum humbug... but I have 100 bottles of good champagne on ice that says this isn't just another sideshow novelty. (AUDIENCE TITTERS) May I present... the Swedish Nightingale... Miss Jenny Lind.

Of course, and I've heard so much about you! And your father tells me you're a fan of the ballet. Yes, I'm studying ballet. Are you? - Of course, I am. - And, of course, she is. And what about you, Helen? You look like a princess, ma'am. (ALL LAUGH) I have to admit, Barnum... she is remarkable. Enough to bring joy to the most joyless critic, isn't she? Mmm. And in the hands of a real purveyor of the arts, - she could be something in this country. - (LAUGHS) Shame, she's fallen in with you. You really are better on the page, Mr. Bennett, hard as that is to believe. WOMAN: Mr. Barnum, I'd love to meet Miss Lind. - PHINEAS: And you will meet Miss Lind. - WOMAN: Would you introduce us? - If you just give me a moment-- - Phineas. Yes. You've... done well. Thank you. Allow me to introduce you. Uh, excuse me, Jenny. I'd like you to meet Charity's parents. Mr. and Mrs. Hallett. Ah, pleasure. - How do you do? Very nice to meet you. - Good to meet you. - Mother. - Hello, dear. - (CLEARS THROAT) - MRS. HALLETT: Are these-- Yes, yes, those are your granddaughters. - Phineas, not here. - Not here? You afraid I'm gonna embarrass your parents in front of their fancy friends? I-- I really don't think I have that power. An insignificant man like me who was clearly destined to lead an insignificant life. All that fortune, and still just the tailor's boy. Get out. Well, Phineas... I believe I told you that free champagne is a recipe for disaster. - Charity. - Now would everyone please - raise their glasses? - PHINEAS: Charity. To Mr. Barnum, who has shown once and for all that a man's station is limited only by his imagination. - To Barnum! To Barnum! - Thank you. To Mr. Barnum. Thank you. It's hard to understand wealth and privilege when you're born into it. (CHUCKLES) (WHISPERS) I sometimes don't feel like I belong here. You? I was born out of wedlock... and that brought shame upon my family. And life always manages to remind me that I don't deserve a place in this world. And that... leaves a hole that no ovation can ever fill. (BOISTEROUS LAUGHTER) - Mr. Phineas! - Guys... Lord, that lady can sing! I know. Think she likes a man in uniform? I'm sure she does. Okay, what are you doing here? You got a show in an hour, okay? That's enough time for us to have at least three drinks, right? - Come on, let's go. - No, no, no. Lettie! - What? - It's very crowded in here, okay? And I can't have you mingling-- guys! Who's gonna pay admission if you're out there for all the world to see? - Okay? Have a great show. - Wait. - (GLASS CHIMES) - PHINEAS: Ladies and gentlemen, a toast! Jenny, America may not know it yet... but they are going to love you. CROWD: To Miss Lind!

Why do you need to tour the country? Why did Napoleon march on Russia? Napoleon was defeated. Napoleon didn't have a 60-piece orchestra. A 60-piece orchestra? Just get the cheapest musicians you can and watch that. We'll still have to board them. We'll get married ones, they can share a bunk. O'Malley, that's Caroline's piggy bank. - PHILLIP: Custom sets? - PHINEAS: Yeah. - PHILLIP: Fireworks? - PHINEAS: Uh-huh. Inside theaters? That's genius. No. Hey, P.T. These are the most famous theaters in the country. They make you buy the seats in advance just to book them. Yeah. I took out a loan. - And we have to pay Jenny in advance? - It was a large loan. Okay? You're not gonna see a penny of profit until your 40th show... 41st, actually. You're risking everything you've built here. How do you think I built it? We'll have plenty of profits to go around after this. - P.T.? - What? Your attention has been divided long enough. Our gate is down, we have more protesters every day. You just need to get people to come back. "If you haven't been to the Barnum Museum lately, you haven't been at the Barnum Museum." They come to see you. Your crazy ideas... your new acts, the unusual. Well, then how about you show them a smile? That'd be unusual. Keep rehearsing. Just make it very clear I expect them to afford you all the deference you deserve and that they should be nice to you anyway. LETTIE: Ain't that a sight for sore eyes? (SCOFFS) Couldn't even say "hello." Or "goodbye." He's going on tour. - Sorry, guys. - Oh, pull yourself together, Carlyle.
