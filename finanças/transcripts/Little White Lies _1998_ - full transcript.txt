Will you be all right? Why shouldn't I be? Drive carefully. She's been out there half an hour. We've got to get back, but we couldn't just leave her. Thanks. I've got to go to the hospital to identify him, but it won't be David. -But you'll freeze out here... -Don't touch me! -Let's go back to the house. -I don't want to be touched! There was a suitcase in the car and a passport. Inside the passport was a ferry ticket to France. You don't see, do you? -Beth... -If someone nicked David's passport. Someone stole his passport. Stole his car. They wouldn't make a mistake. He wouldn't go anywhere without telling me. They did every possible check before they... He wouldn't just go. Not like that. He wouldn't. -David isn't like that. -Beth, wait. Come on. Out you get. It's Ossy! Rosie, put him down. He loves me. He only wants to play. It's not our cat. It's Beth's. -Hello? -Julia. -Who is this? -It's Peter. Peter Pritchard. It's Beth. Can you come over? Why? What's happened? There's been an accident. -A car accident. -Is she hurt? Not Beth. David. He's dead. The police have gone. The doctor came. He wanted someone to stay with her for a while. It's not that I don't want to. I don't know what to... She needs a woman with her. Just until Helen gets here. I rang the cottage and the office. They're trying to contact her. Yes, all right. You don't want to believe it. You just want to find anything that will help you shut it out. It hurts. It physically hurts. It's just so... ...sad. What was he? 35? That's only half a life. I've got this urge to run away. Just get in the van and drive away, go anywhere, nowhere. That's how I felt, after Becky. She was only a baby. Did you have... Did you or Oliver have... -To identify her? -Yes. I did. Oliver was distraught. They look so different. Hardly human. She looked like a doll. -Are you cold? -No... No. I just suddenly feel very tired. Shock. It gets you like that. I slept for a month after Becky. Would you come with me? I said I'd go to iden... To see if it is David. Yes, of course. Thank you. What's wrong with Rosie? It's all right, poppet. It's all right. It's all right. That stupid doctor. I keep telling him she's not well. I should know about my own child. -We can clean her up in the house. -No. No, I'd better get her home to bed. Why does no one listen to me? Why don't you come and stay with me at the cottage for a few days? Hello, Julia. -I've got to go. -Let me know how Rosie is. I shall miss David. Come and stay. Come and stay with me, Beth. David was under a lot of pressure at work. I was too busy to talk, at least, talk properly. At breakfast, we had this row. Well, not really a row. You couldn't row with David. He wasn't that sort. He hated confrontation. It was the silences. He would just sit there, not saying a word. What I didn't realise was that he had his suitcase in the car. He was running away from me! I must've been hateful for him to do that. This wouldn't have happened if he hadn't been trying to get away from me... You mustn't think that way, Beth. It's ridiculous. Don't become a glutton for guilt. Come to the cottage. I'll pack a few things for you. The best thing for me to do is to keep working. I've got so much on. All my stuff is here. How was Beth? She was all right when I left. I'll call in on my way home. I wouldn't. She'll probably be asleep. She was exhausted. I tried to get her to stay with me for a few days, but you know what she's like... And what she can be like. Are you all right? It's dreadful. Just dreadful. You don't look well. You should go home. I've got someone coming in. Are you sure you're all right, Oliver? I could cancel this meeting. One of the witnesses to the accident told the police that they thought they saw David driving straight at the lorry. What? It's bound to come out at the inquest. Have they told Beth? I asked them not to, not yet. Nor must we. Not a word to anybody. You understand? Of course. She's got enough to put up with as it is. It's probably nonsense. When will the inquest be? Two weeks, maybe longer. Bloody nonsense. I just don't believe it. Not David. It's an accident. An appalling accident. I can't find David's file. I've been looking for it. I knew you'd need it. Oh, I took it home. It's at home. She's asleep. Are you sure? I read her a story. She seems all right now. A bit pale, but her temperature's down. I think we should change doctors. -Oliver? -If that's what you want. I talked to the police. Did Beth tell you? David was going abroad. Had a ferry ticket to France. One way. Did Beth know this? Did they tell her, the police? You don't think she knew? She said nothing to me. No mention of it. She told me David was on his way to work. You... You don't... You don't seem surprised. Surprised? -That he was going. -To France? No. Going. I think he was leaving her. Why do you say that? They weren't getting on. How do you know? I thought it was obvious. You only had to watch them together. You didn't know about this trip? How could I? Nothing at all? No. David. David? David! David! David! David! David! David! He was identified by his own GP at the scene of the accident. So we've put him in the chapel rather than the room we use for identification. We thought you might prefer that. Are you all right? Yes. It shouldn't take long. I'd like to come in. May I? Is it possible? -It's not usual... -I'd like her to. Very well. Where are his glasses? His glasses, his clothes... Where are his clothes? -I expect they... -David was smart. He was very smart. He liked to look nice. He wouldn't like to be dressed in that thing he had on. He would like to have his own clothes. The undertaker will see to that, I'm sure. Who's dealing with it? It? It? Who's dealing with it? I'm sorry. I meant the funeral. What were you crying for? It should be me crying. Maybe you should. It's quite normal. It might help. I'm sorry. That wasn't necessary. Nor that, poor man. I thought you were wonderful. Did you see his face? He looked as though he'd swallowed a fly. He is dead, isn't he? He is dead, Julia. That was David in there. He is dead. I know that now. What have the people's politics achieved? Tests were carried out, cars are still being exported, and there will be more Brent Spars, but, at the very least, the world took note. In September, nature reminded us of her fury again. A spectacular volcanic eruption in New Zealand. The weather went crazy this year from Florida to the Philippines... There. Can I have a kitten? We'll see. A white one, like Ossy. It's very, very late. Go to sleep. -She's asleep. -Are you sure? You ask me that every time. Yes, Julia, I'm sure. -I'd better go and check. -Leave her alone. You never leave her alone. -She's my daughter, too. -You hardly ever see her. She's never allowed to see me. What's that supposed to mean? She's always in bed by the time I get home. She's six years old. What do you expect? Even when I try to come home early. Don't start drinking. I suppose you'll be sleeping in the chair in her room again tonight? She's not well. Rosie's not well. She's been in bed for two days. No wonder she can't sleep. All kids are sick now and then. Now and then? It's part of growing up. You know the pregnancy was full of problems. When she was born she had respiratory problems. She's never been well. You never allow her to be well! You're always on at her about how she feels! Is she hot? Is she cold? Is she tired? Is she... Has she got a sore throat? Is she... Feeling faint? Is she... Is she feeling sick? You're watching her all the time. You won't let her play with the other children. You won't let her play with a cat. She's ill. Rosie is ill. Why can't you understand that? How much more of that stuff do you have to pour down you before you forget our other daughter? That was an accident, Julia. Now I suppose you're going to say that accidents happen "now and then"! Where are you going? You'll never understand how I feel about it. Becky's death was my fault. Part of me died with Becky. Julia... Julia! Rosie? Rosie? You're worried about Beth, aren't you? Yeah. I don't think she knows how to deal with it. She's behaving very oddly. I don't quite know what to do. Just stay close to her. Be there when she needs you. It's all you can do. I'm here if you need me. You haven't seemed to, lately. I know this is an appalling time for you. I just thought you ought to be aware of your position as far as... My position? Regarding the house and so on. Oh, yes, yes. As you know, the equity on the house is low, based on the last valuation. However, with the further charges -and the surrender of the fund... -I'm sorry? The small share fund left to David by, um... Yes, yes. David realised the fund three weeks ago. He... No. He said he needed the money. I could find out how much was raised. I knew nothing about this. Further charge, what was it you... The form you signed. What form? Last month. The second mortgage. I've never seen this before. I didn't sign this. Um... Perhaps we should discuss this later. When you're feeling a bit more... I did not sign this, Oliver. It looks like my signature, but I've never seen this piece of paper before. The charge raised another £35,000 on the house. 35? For an extension. Exten... Extension? What do you mean, extension? Conservatory. A workshop for you. David had to present a builder's estimate to the mortgage company. Peter Pritchard? You didn't know? This £35,000. David got a cheque? Over a month ago. We had a bank statement last week. It's a joint account. There was nothing like that amount deposited. Where did David put that money? Beth... Beth. I'll look into the whole matter for you... David must've got at least £20,000 on the shares. You own the house outright. The endowment policy will pay the outstanding sum... That's over £50,000. ...and the money will be somewhere. He wasn't coming back, he was leaving me, going to live in France. That's what he wanted the money for. Sitting there, doing those crosswords, quietly working all the details out in that precise way of his, secretly laughing at me. He must've really hated me. Beth... You knew about this, didn't you? -No. -You knew about the shares, you knew about the other money. You knew exactly what he wanted it for. I knew nothing whatsoever about it, David never mentioned any of this to me. If he had, I would've, er... Did he have another woman? What? Simple question. Was David having an affair? Was he leaving with anyone? I really couldn't say. Oh! Oh, hey, Beth. Watch the feet. Why didn't you tell me? -What? -About the estimate. For the conservatory. Oh... David wanted it to be a surprise. Surprise? Surprise? £35,000 for something I didn't want. Wouldn't use. Surprise? Look... I'm sorry, Beth, -but David asked me not to... -What happened to the money? How much have you had of it? I thought we were friends. I don't know what you're talking about. Look... -I'm told by my solicitor... -I know this is a bad time for you. ...who I also thought was a friend, that my dead husband forged my signature to get... -Forged your signature? -...£35,000... -David forged your signature? -...to employ another friend to build an extension on a house that I've never liked, never wanted to own in the first place! Of course, none of my friends or my dear dead husband thought of asking me if I wanted the damn thing and of course, no one knows where the money is at this precise moment! I haven't had a penny! David told me he was organising the money. What did Oliver say? David got a cheque from the building society... I wouldn't trust that scheming shite, whatever he said. I hate lies and liars. David did nothing but lie to me for months. So you think I'm lying to you? You think I've hid some of this missing money. I don't know what to think any more. Do you want to see my bank statements? All I know is that I'm left to pay off an extra £35,000. I think you'd better go... I simply want someone to tell me the truth. ...before I say something I'm gonna regret later. Run and catch the dicky-bird Fly and catch the dicky-bird Go on, then. See if you can catch it. You can't get it, can you? You can't get it. Rosie-posie, pudding and pie. There you are. Daddy will chase you. Off you go. That's it. But I'm not gonna chase you, I'm just going to catch you! Why are you doing this to me, Oliver? Sorry, Beth, I didn't know you were... Come in. No, no. No, I can come back when... No, please. I'm glad you've come. -Look, I'm sorry about... -I was going to ring... I'd just been to see Oliver and I was furious. Yeah. Helen told me you threw a glass of brandy over him. I trusted him completely. I know nothing about that money, Beth. I know. I'm sorry. So, I suppose the funeral's the next thing. -I'm sorry, I shouldn't... -It's not you. It's me. You know, I tend to say what comes into my head. I'm... I'm sorry. David was the opposite. You could see him working out what to say minutes before he said it. I'll shall be burying a man I never really knew. Since his death, David has become a total stranger. You don't know there was another woman. You're all confused. Guilt mixed with anger, anxiety over the money. Buddhists have a saying. "The two things to avoid at all costs "are hope and fear." If there was another woman, he was a bloody fool. First, you sack Oliver and get another solicitor. I can't prove anything. It's my word against his. It's a lot of money, Beth. It's got to be somewhere. Let's go through this step by step. You say your husband negotiated a second charge without your knowledge and forged your signature on it. My solicitor showed me a copy of the form. That was the first time I'd seen it. It wasn't my signature. It was very like it, but... He's meant to have both parties in front of him when they sign. He should have made sure the signature was genuinely yours. It's a legal requirement. It was a home improvement loan. For a conservatory he never intended should be built. Where's the money now? I don't know. I do know that it didn't go into our joint bank account. Is the will in probate? Mr Woods is the executor. I see. At the risk of sounding like your solicitor, may I look into this for you? Who? Who? He who would valiant be 'Gainst all disaster Let him in constancy Follow the master There's no discouragement Shall make him once relent I was too busy to talk, at least, talk properly. At breakfast... We had this row. Who so beset him round It shouldn't take long. I'd like to come in. May I? Is that possible? What were you crying for? It should be me crying. No foes shall stay his might Though he with giants fight What was he? 35? That's only half a life. We waited ages and ages, then we just came back again. To be a pilgrim Did he have another woman? What? Simple question. Was David having an affair? I really couldn't say. I shall miss David. I'll still follow you. Mrs March? It was you. It was you. Mrs March! That's Mrs March, isn't it? Beth? Beth? Beth. Beth. -Get out! -No! -Get out! -Beth, please! Get out! Beth, I want to talk to you. I must talk to you. Just get out! You must let me explain. Explain? Explain? What is there to explain? It just happened. It wasn't planned. Nothing David ever did just happened, he planned everything. It wasn't anything either of us enjoyed. At least that's original! I mean, we didn't enjoy deceiving you. You didn't seem to enjoy very much about it at all, did you? What was the sex like? I hope he was better than with me. Where did you do it? Here? In my bed? No. Not your place. Stains on the sheets. That wouldn't do. Oliver might see them. Back of the car? Not David's style. He was hardly a man for base urges. He always insisted on having a shower first. Very clean man, David. Beth, please... "Beth, please, Beth, please." You really are pathetic. David always cared about you. He cared about me, did he? He cared about my feelings? I can just imagine the two of you discussing how poor old Beth would feel if she found out her husband was screwing his solicitor's wife! It wasn't like that. What was it like, then, Julia? You say you've come here to explain. So explain. I went to David for help about money, to advise me how to get hold of some money... ...to leave Oliver. You were leaving Oliver? I was trying to think of a way. I was trying to work out a way. I needed someone to talk to. I didn't mean it to happen, neither of us did. You were going to join him in France. He was going to find somewhere to live and we were going to join him later. I took Rosie down that morning... To see him off at the ferry. He took the money for you. He stole money from me for you. Stole? Thousands. I don't know what you're talking about. Who suggested it? You? Suggested what? Forging my signature on that application. I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about. Where is the money? What did David do with the money? It's my money. Look, all I know about money is that David lost a lot. That thing with Oliver, the investment fund. What investment fund? Oliver's deal. What deal? I don't understand these things. All I know is that David hardly had any money. A few hundred. I was going to sell my jewellery. Did Oliver know about you and David? I think he suspected something, yes. I think he might've got that money from David by threatening him. I think that could've been the hold he had over him. Telling you about us. Blackmail? Oliver's capable of anything. He's obsessed with money. Money, money, money! It's people that matter. I loved David. I loved him. Me. Me, not you. You didn't love him. And he loved me. You couldn't even cry when he was killed. Not one tear. You didn't love him. You didn't even care very much about him. You're just like Oliver. All you care about is the money. The bloody money. When did you last sleep with David? You can't remember, it's so long ago. David told me. Over a year. That's not a marriage. That's why it happened. If anyone's to blame, Beth, it's you. Oh, I slept with him on Sunday, the day before he died. Ossy? Ossy? If you're on that bed again... Ossy? Os-cat? Os, are you hiding from me? What... Oh. Yuck! Yuck. What's that? Oh, no. Oh! Rosie... Rosie! I came to play with Ossy. Does your mummy know you're here? I want to see Ossy. -Where's your mummy? -Where is he? I haven't seen him. Is he... Rosie, where's Julia? I dressed myself. -Is she all right? -I got my own breakfast. Your mummy, is she all right? Where is he? Ossy! Ossy! It's cold out here. Has he... Been ill? No, he's not about just now. I've been ill. Have you? Yes. I'm always ill. There's something wrong with me. Rosie, does your mother know you're here? David's dead, isn't he? Yes. David died. It was very sad. Are you going to die? Not for a long while. Would you like a drink of orange? Am I going to die? I'd better ring Julia. Is Ossy dead? Your mummy'll be worried. She was sick. She's lying down. I don't like orange juice. Could I have coffee? Is she here? She's always here with that bloody cat. I was just calling you. Do you know how long I have been looking for you? She can stay here if you like. I want to stay! I want to stay! - She can help me in the garden. - She's mine. She's my child. You get one of your own. Oh, I forgot, you can't. You can't have children. David told me. What's happened? Ossy's dead. Someone killed my cat. I left the back door unlocked. Anyone could have got in. Was anything stolen? Nothing was taken. There was no damage. Nothing was disturbed. Who the hell would break into a house to kill a cat? I know. It doesn't make sense. But they did come in to do exactly that. They drowned him in the old lavatory. Beth, look. You've got to go to the police. To report what? That my cat drowned? The cat didn't just drown. Some sick sod killed it. Come here. I need a bath. David didn't sweat. I don't think I ever saw him sweat. The smell... ...is real. It's honest. I read once that if you're inside, looking out a window, it means hope. What if you're outside looking in? You're looking out, Beth. This must never happen again. -Beth... -Never, ever again. I'm not married to Helen. We don't even see each other that often. Lying beside David in bed, I used to think about this. Making love to you. I even used to think what would happen if I were free. Now I am, but everything has changed. You have to give it time, Beth. I've changed. David's death has changed me, you have to understand that. Do you have any idea how I feel about you? How I've felt about you ever since we met? The first moment we met? It ends here. It has to end here now. Why? It should never have come to this. Why? We're not doing anything wrong. Aren't we? I'm thinking of moving. Selling the house and going away... As far away as I can. What about your business? I'll start another one, with the money from the house. Where will you live? I'll rent somewhere. You're under a lot of stress at the moment, Beth. Ever since David's death, I've been feeling detached. I thought I could cope. Start again, same place, same people. Then I realised that this house, this place... Was somehow his, not mine. All the familiar things seem unfamiliar. I don't belong here any more. Perhaps I never did. There's nothing to hold me here now. That bitch at the building society reported me. The law society are real trouble. If Beth does that, it'll ruin me. I don't think she has yet otherwise I'd have heard from her. She's threatened to. What did you say to her? - You can't just... - What did you tell her? - I went to see her... - A pack of bloody lies! You'd say anything, won't you? Don't talk to me about lies! Anything! You despicable bastard! Will you keep your voice down! Did you mean what you said last night? About moving away? I can't explain. It's all got very complicated. With Oliver? He's part of it. I thought he was a friend, all he's done is lie to me. I don't know what's been going on, but I've never seen him so nervous. He's drinking too much, and... Julia was in this morning and they were screaming and shouting at each other. I bet he's a bastard to live with. Don't get caught in this thing between them, Beth. It's a poisonous marriage. I feel sorry for Rosie. Poor little scrap! Leave them to it. Let them get on with it. You've got David's death to deal with. Financial problems. You didn't come to talk about them, did you? You love him, don't you? Peter. Does he love you? A little bit. Just a little bit, I think. Have you slept with him? Have you? Once. A long time ago, before Peter met you. You're not going away because of him? No! It's got nothing to do with Peter. It's time to move on... I'd better be getting back. Yes. Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? - Hello? - Beth... I just want to say... I didn't mean... I mean, David and me, we didn't mean to hurt you. You... You've got to understand... It... It just happened. We didn't know it was going to happen. It just... Look, Julia, why don't... I just want to say, how sorry I am... ...and how I... I... I can't go on like this. I... I can't... I... I can't... Everything's so bloody awful for Rosie and I! Julia. Rosie? Rosie! Rosie? How is she? Still unconscious. I never meant this to happen. Why did you do it? How could you do it? You don't know. You don't know. He threatened to take her away. Oliver? To take her away. -Take her? Take her where? -Take her away from me. He was going to have me committed. He was going to have me locked away and then take her away. I couldn't let him do that. You believe me, don't you? Rosie's all I've got left. You understand, don't you? I could understand you in that car, but not Rosie. Not Rosie. I don't know what to do. You see, nobody believes me. "Oh, it's not Oliver Woods," they all say. "It's not him. It can't be him. "It's her. It's the wife. "She's unstable." That's what he tells them. That's what he says about me. He... He lies about me, when all the time it's him. He's the one who's unstable. He's the sick one. He's the sick one. What? Beth. I didn't know you were... Beth. Beth, you can't... You lying bastard. What are you talking about? You just sit there and answer my questions. You told me you and David weren't involved in any sort of deal. Beth, Beth, look... This is from the bank. I asked to see David's private accounts. They wouldn't allow it. Oh, yes, they would, and did. I am his next of kin. You promised you would look into David's finances for me, didn't you? -Yes, but... -And have you? I wonder why? Because you didn't need to, did you? Why bother to find out what you already know. Let me see it. Surely you didn't think I'd never find out, did you? You can't be that stupid. Or did you think I was stupid? You're hysterical, and I've got an appointment in about five minutes. Cancel it, or I go straight to the law society. I've done nothing unprofessional, Beth. You lied to me. There was a reason for that. You're still lying. Will you listen to me? Not to more lies. You can't lie about this, can you? David had a private account. He received £22,233 from the sale of his shares that his father left him. This was a month ago. The day that he wrote the letter instructing you to remove the shares from his will, on the same day, he signed a cheque that paid £22,223 into an account held by you. David owed me the money. And this... This is the mortgage advance, the money that you forged my signature to get. I didn't forge anything. David, uh... It's here in black and white. Look... About the £22,000. All right, I haven't been honest with you. Honest? You only use words to tell lies. David gave me the money freely. He thought he could double it. So did I. We, um, had an investment plan. It failed. I lost almost everything. But as for the other thing, the second mortgage, I know nothing about that. David brought me the application form, countersigned by you, but he didn't tell me what it was really for. The money was paid into an offshore account. Just a number, no name. That proves it. It proves nothing except that you've got some bloody offshore account. I don't... Nothing like that. I have no idea where the money went. I'm getting tired of telling you. I've had enough of this bloody nonsense! My daughter nearly died! That sick bitch... ...tried to kill my daughter. It's very informal. No wigs or gowns. It's a district judge, so be careful about what you say. More important, the way you say it. It's a woman. That's our advantage. She'll probably ask for another psychiatric assessment. What, another one? Why? Everyone gets depressed. You're very fortunate you're not in a secure unit. You could still face an attempted murder charge. We wish an interim residence in respect to the child and ask the court to order that Mrs Woods should have no contact and that she should leave the marital home. She should leave the marital home. She should leave the marital home. After consulting with medical staff, and the mother and father in this case... ...should have no contact. ...cast doubt on the mother's ability to care for the child at this stage, bearing in mind the mother's state of mental health... Following an agreement being reached, we would apply for the child to be placed under an emergency protection order. You have to agree not to see Rosie for seven days, and not go to the house while they make their report. I take it that you can make a full report within seven days and return for a further hearing. By then we should have the psychiatric assessment. Protect? What do you mean "protect"? There's no need to protect her. There's no need to protect my child. No, there's no need for this! I'm a good mother. I... Mrs Woods, sit down. I don't want her in care. You haven't the right. - She's only little. - She's not well. Only I know how to look after her. She... She can't manage without her mother. She can't manage without me. Isn't anyone... Sit down, Mrs Woods. Now either you agree to a review of the case in seven days' time or I shall approve the protection order. No! No! No! No! No! Here we are, sweetheart. In you go. That's it. Now, lean back. That's it. I'll soon have you away from here. That's it. Snowflake's all right? Good. Has Helen said anything to you? No, not a word. I didn't even know she'd been here. I lied to her about the other day in the barn. I hated myself for it. I still do. I don't ever want to lie to anyone again. Let it ring. They'll ring back. Let go. Hello? He's taken Rosie. Julia. I'm at the hospital. I came to see her. He's probably taken her home. Have you rung there? There's no answer. I'm not allowed near the house. Will you go and see? Will you go and see if they're there, at the house? I don't think that I should... This is something you and Oliver have to... I don't particularly want to see Oliver. Not after... I'll never ask anything of you again, I swear it. I swear. Please. Please, this one time, please. All right. All right, I'll go, I'll call you back. Where are you? - It's a payphone. - 2-0-4-2-3-0. Ten minutes. Wait there. Go where? Oliver's taken Rosie from the hospital. Julia wants me to see if they're at the house. And why can't she see her? Sounds like she's been barred from the house by the court. Why are you letting this woman use you like this, manipulate you? You don't even like her. Look, Beth, you've got to stop it. How? Just walk away? -Yes. -I can't. David's death dragged me into this. I'm part of it. I can't just walk away, pretend it's not happening. Oliver and Julia are dragging you... I don't give a damn about Oliver and Julia! All I know is that I'm sick with worry about Rosie. Someone's got to keep an eye on those two before they completely disfigure her life. Look... If the court has stopped Julia from going to her house, then there must be a good reason. They must think the kid is safer with her father. This is none of your business. The hospital, the police, the court, they can't all be wrong! Get out of my way! We went there for our honeymoon. He's been back there several times. I can't stand the place. That's where he's taken her. I'm sure that's where he's taken her. That's where they are. -He wouldn't have put her in a hotel, would he? -Why not? How would he leave her there on her own? He must have hired someone. A nurse, a nanny. It's a private hotel, like a country house. Secluded. It's perfect. Oh, my God. Oliver's always had a taste for the grotesque. Wait till you see inside. Can I help you? Yes. We're here to see Mr Woods. - Mr... - Oliver Woods. We don't have a Mr Woods registered. Yes, you do. I'm sorry. You're mistaken. A tall man with a little girl. Fair hair. We don't take children here. Drive round the back. Julia, they're not here! -This way. -You heard what he said. They're here. I know they're here. You don't. You don't know anything of the sort. Beth, please. I don't believe him. Drive! Come on! I thought so. Rosie. Rosie, darling... -She doesn't want to see you. Haven't you hurt her enough? -Darling... -Now get out of here. -Bastard. What have you said to her? What have you told her? Why is she... Rosie? What about showing me around the garden so that Mummy and Daddy can talk? -Rosie, come here. -I thought... -Come here, Rosie. -There are peacocks. Three peacocks. I'm not gonna run away with her. We thought they'd gone. -I'm so sorry, Mr Woods. -Oh. Oh, you see... You see, Beth? You see how he infects them with his lies. Now you go with Mrs Spencer, Rosie. -I don't want to. -Come on, lovely. I want to show Beth the peacocks. Do as you're told, now! Get your hands off her. Let go of her, you cow! Julia, don't. It'll only make things worse. Rosie! Rosie! I saw the lab report from the hospital. They found a strong tranquilliser in Rosie's blood. A tranquilliser? He's lying again. Julia was prescribed it after Becky's death. He'll say anything to get his way. They couldn't bring her round at the hospital. They did a blood test and found it. You drugged her to keep her quiet in the car. He's lying, Beth. Can't you see? He's lying. I've been wondering for some time why Rosie was so... ...tired, so lethargic. She's ill. I keep telling you. I keep telling everyone, she's ill. Why is she ill, Julia? Why is she ill so often? There must be a reason. You're the reason. You won't listen to me. All you want to do is send me to a psychiatrist. You need help, Julia. You... You know you do. You're not well. It's Rosie who's not well. Why can't you get that through that imbecilic brain of yours? I want to help you, Julia. We... We all want to. You've got to let us. You just want to take Rosie from me. All these... These dreadful lies are just to get Rosie away from me. You want to steal my child. She's all I've got left. She's all that keeps me sane. You know... If you'd see a psychiatrist... I've seen a psychiatrist. He says I'm depressed. Who wouldn't be depressed, living with a bastard like you? Mr Woods. Uh, it's all right. You want me to call the police? - No, it's all right. - She's a little upset. I'm all right. Uh... Uh... I'm so sorry for causing the disturbance. Beth. I must talk to you. I'm sorry, Mr Woods. -It's just that the other guests have returned for tea. -Ah. We'll go outside. Oh. Oh, and I've sent you a tape. -It was amongst Julia's things. -A tape? Yes, it was on our answering machine. There's a message from David on it. I went to see a specialist. We went right through for six years, since Rosie was born. He thinks it might be more than depression. He thinks it's possible, just possible that Julia's suffering from a mental disorder called Munchausen's By Proxy. The person draws attention to themselves by a series of... ...induced or imagined illnesses. But Julia never complains of being ill. No. It's by proxy. Julia doesn't make herself ill. Julia makes Rosie ill. He thinks Julia may have been giving Rosie her medication for some time. Surely your GP would have known. Munchausen's sufferers are very clever, very devious. Very convincing. It's only when a series of things come together that... Julia loves Rosie. She's only behaving like this because she's scared she might lose her. Why does Rosie keep hiding from her? Why is she so frightened of her? People with this illness often go undetected because they make such a show of loving their child. A child that they're slowly and systematically destroying. Liar! Liar! Liar! She loves me! Rosie loves me! She's mine! You're not gonna get her with your lies! I think he's dead. We better hide him. No one will find him in here. Not in here. Help me. You're in this, too. Bloody well help me! Whee! Come on, Beth. Come on. Beth? Are you listening? Come on! Peacocks! Look! Not now. Mummy... Hey! Stop! Where do you think you're going? Get in. You were going without us. We've gotta go to the police. Oh, don't be ridiculous. Oliver's... -You must. -Shut up. Get us out of here. Come on. You've all turned against me. Him and Oliver... Now you. Him? You mean David? -Love her... -You never had an affair, did you? -Love her, love her... -With David. Oliver said maybe once. -Maybe you slept with David once. -Love her too much. -Just once? -Love her too much. You can't do that to a person and then just let it drop. Screw them, then ignore them. I told him I'd follow him. He wasn't leaving me at all. Oh-ho, he was leaving, all right, both of us. I'd have stopped him, but then he went and killed himself first. -Killed himself? -Weak. Weak. Like all bloody men. It was an accident. Oh! Oliver didn't tell you? David drove the car straight at the lorry. The witnesses told the police and the police told Oliver. Oliver. Oliver! Olly-ver. Olly-veugh! Oh, Christ! I hate that name! Julia. Julia! Julia! Julia! Julia. Julia. Julia. I told David Julia would follow him. You can't use me and then just forget me. You can't neglect me... ...after that. You can't ignore me. He shut me out. No one listens. They all try and ignore me. Stop! Stop! Stop the van! Get out. It's all right. It's all right, poppet. Everything's all right. Get out! No, Beth! Beth, no! Beth! -Are you all right? -Yes. -Have you been to the police? -No. Why not? Well, you've got to let them deal with it, Beth. Right, we're going to the police. No. If she sees the police, she might hurt Rosie. We're going to see the birds. I'm going to show you the birds. I used to show Becky the birds. Don't you want to see the birds? No, no! I want Beth! Beth's cat killed birds. Always killing birds. I want Beth! Where's Beth? I'm going to show you the birds, and then we'll go away, on holiday. You'd like to go on holiday, wouldn't you? Where's Daddy? Where is he? Daddy's gone on holiday. We're going to meet him. - Beth. - We're going to meet him there. When I've shown you the birds, we're going to see Daddy. That was the window Becky fell from. Okay. Try to keep her talking. Mmm. Beth, what are you doing here? I came to see you, Julia. I thought we could talk about your garden. I'm showing Rosie the birds. You asked me to help you with your garden, don't you remember? We talked about plants and trees. You wanted me to give you some advice. How's David? Still at work. He works too hard. Yes, yes, you're right. He does. Like Oliver. We're going on holiday. Aren't we, poppet? Hmm? To see Daddy. I'm just showing her the birds, and then we're going on holiday. I'll show Rosie the birds, if you like. Then you can get ready. Ready? To go on a holiday. Most of the birds are gone now, Julia. All the swallows, swifts, flying in the garden. Hold on to Mummy's arm, Rosie. All the birds were flying close to the house. And I told Becky if... If she reaches out, she could touch them. It was my fault. It was my fault. Of course it wasn't your fault, Julia. It was a terrible accident. We were only trying to touch the birds. Oh! No! No, you're not going to take her! No! No! She's mine! She's mine! Don't worry. I've got you. You're okay now, don't worry. Don't worry, sweetheart. You're all right. Julia. Julia? Julia! Julia. Julia. Julia. Julia. Julia. Are you watching? Are you watching Julia? Julia, this is David. The money's been transferred to the numbered account. You have instant access to it. Now I've done what you wanted, you must leave me alone. You must, Julia. You've got to stop hounding me. There's enough money for you to leave Oliver. That's what you wanted. That's what you said you wanted. I don't love you. I couldn't ever love you. It's all in your mind. I love Beth. I love her too much. She's my wife. I'm thinking of going away for a while to get away from you. Somewhere you can't reach me, to try and sort things out in my mind. For God's sake, wipe this message, in case Oliver... I'm sending this back to you, David. Don't think you can get away from me. I'll find you wherever you go. Wherever you hide... I'll find you. Rosie? Rosie? Tea time! I'm coming, Grandma!
