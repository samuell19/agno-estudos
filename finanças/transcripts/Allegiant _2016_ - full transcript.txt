Hello. I come from outside the wall, where we have all but destroyed each other. We designed you city as an experiment. And we believe it is the only way to recover the humanity we have lost. And we created Factions to ensure peace. But we believe there will be those among you who will transcend these factions, these will be the Divergent. They are the true purpose of this experiment, they are vital to humanity survival. If you are watching this now, then at least one of you is proof that our experiment has succeeded. The time has come for you to emerge from your isolation and rejoin us. On Evelyn's orders: This gate is now closed! We've allowed you to believe that you’re the last of us, but you’re not. Mankind waits for you with hope, beyond the Wall. ALLEGIANT We're almost there. Yeah, I'm right behind you. What are you, afraid of heights? No. Who told you that? Sometimes when I look past the wall, I think that I can see something out there. Do you? No. I don't. Maybe you need to look harder. I am looking. I'm just not seeing what you see. When it's right in front of your face, you will. You sure we're going to do this? Yeah. People of Chicago, I know you are curious about what's beyond the wall, but sometimes walls are there to protect us. Remember, the founders were the ones who divided us into Factions. So, until we know their intentions, the wall must stay closed. Jeanine is dead. Today, we begin the trials of her conspirators. Put the traitors on trial, close down the gate. Didn't take her long to make the same mistakes as Jeanine. I need to talk to her. I still think I can bring her around. But that doesn't change anything, right?. No. I need you to get somethings for me. Just this? You sure you don't want the sun and moon as well? - I know it's a lot. - It's impossible. - So? - So, I'll make it happen. Well. Hello, ladies. Where are we going? Can I come? - Give it up, Peter. - Why so hostile! There's no faction. We can be friends, right? Can't we all just get along? Tris. Your should be up there with all the other leaders of the city. No, it's not me. I don't want to make the rules. Great leaders don't seek power, they're called by necessity. They need you. Look at me! Look at me, traitor! - You're going to die in there! - Back up. You're going to die in there! Move! Sit tight. We all find ourselves on new ground. I dedicated my life to seeking the truth, but under Jeanine, it passed me by. And for that, I humbly apologize. But my personal failure has only strengthened my resolve to make things right. While the Faction of Candor may no longer exist, I want everyone to know that I will not stop leading the pursuit of honesty, as we rebuild our city. - Yay! - Yay! Let the trials begin! Justice will be done! - Yay! - Yay! Here. May the truth set you free. There's no doubt, Max, that you helped Jeanine take over Chicago, and exert brutal control over it's citizens. So, my only question to you is this. Did you feel justified in murdering people in support of her regime? Absolutely. People are sheep. They need a shepherd to guide them. And when they resist, they're slaughtered. Monster. We should slaughter you! Kill him! Kill him! - Kill him! - Don't kill him! - Let him live! - Kill him! - Let him live! - Kill him now! Rise above it. You can't do this, stop it! Let him live! We're better than this! Rise above it. Jeanine! Jeanine is dead! Let's not keep her spirit alive. - Kill him! - Let him live! What are you going to do? They need an answer. This is an execution. No. This is a trial. And I yield, to the wishes of the people. It is time, that we break from the past! - Yay! - Yay! You need to die! I don't want to die. Neither did your sheep. Yeah. There was a time I would have said: I leave you with love, not malice. That time has passed. - Kill her! - Traitor! Kill her! Kill her! Traitor! Get out! Out! Get out! Out! Get out! Out! Beatrice! I'm sorry! You incited a mob. Good luck controlling them. Beatrice, please! Don't let them kill me! Beatrice! No! Beatrice! What the hell did you think you're doing? We need to show a united front. Especially, since Tris refuses to stand with us. - I'm not going to tell Tris what to do. - Well, you need to try! Do you really think that you can stop people leaving this city? The wall's on total lock down, my soldiers have orders. No one gets out. Why did you go to war with Jeanine, if you were just going to become her? Leaders need to make tough decisions to protect their people. You'll understand that when you take over from me. I'm doing this for you. You know, it might not be the best time to leave. I know, but we can't be here for every fight. And the message said to come out and meet the rest of the world. Yet, we know absolutely nothing about the people who sent it. Aren't you curious to find out? What about our home? I don't think our home exist any more. Maybe the way to help Chicago is climb beyond the wall. What if there's nothing out there? What If there is nothing left? I can live with that if you are with me, but I can not live without trying. You know, it's Caleb's trial tomorrow. Yeah, I know. I don't owe him anything. No. No, you don't. I'm going to deal with this one. Do you think I'm asking your permission? No, please. No, Four. No! Four. Four. Please don't kill me! I'm sorry! Four, I'm sorry! You tried to kill your own sister, Caleb. You brought this on yourself. I'm sorry, for everything. Come on. We're going up. Come on. Come on. - Beatrice? - Walk slowly. Hey! All Erudite prisoners are suppose to be locked in the cages. Stop! I can handle this one myself. Bring him in! You can come out now, Caleb. Thank you, Four. Thank you. Don't thank me. It's your sister's idea. You saved me? It's what you do for family. Get in the car. I knew it. Hey, partners. What are you doing, Peter? Get out of here. Yes, that's what I'm doing, I'm getting out of here. Look, I don't want to be here when your crazy mom goes around killing everybody who used to work for Jeanine, okay? Look, I can join you guys or I could... Yell: Help! Help! Help! They're getting away! Get in the car, Peter. Get in the car. - That's what I'm saying. - Get in the car. Thank you. What's up, Caleb? Yeah! We want the truth! He's dead. Yeah. Hurry up and kill him. Justice for all! You do have a plan, right? I didn't hear anything about a prisoner transfer. Well, you're hearing it from me. Let me see your movement order. I got it! Right here! I got everything. So, open the gate. One more, come on. Come on, one more. Yeah! Tobias Eaton took Caleb Prior out of his cage. Come on. Let's go, now. Come on! Let's do some more! You a statue? Open the gate. Have they come through here? Let's get out of here. They're getting away. Tobias Eaton is abetting Caleb Prior's escape. That makes him a traitor. Shoot to kill. No body goes over that wall. We have our orders. Ready? Yeah. Not the same as reading in the books, huh? Okay, coast is clear. It's time to see what's out there. Okay. On me. Shit. Release now! I got him. I'm sorry, Four. Come on. Come on. - Ahhhh! - CHRISTINA! - I'm okay. - That part of the plan, Stiff? Evelyn electrified the fence. We did it. Tori. Tori. Tori. Tori! Tori! Okay, Tori. Come on, we got to go. Come on! No! Tori! Tori. Come on, load up! Alright, let's go. Come on. This way! Holy shit. What happened here? Didn't exactly sent out a welcome committee for you, Stiff. Shut up, Peter. Humanity welcomes you with hope. What humanity? This hole looks radioactive. Or at least it was so in the last 200 years. Meaning what exactly? Somebody seriously messed up the world. Shit. Great. Now the sky is bleeding. This way! Come on, let's go! Now, come on. This is fun. I'm glad we did this. What if there's nothing else out there? There has to be. I'm scared. Yeah, I think that's a good thing. You guys hear that? - It's an engine. - Someone's coming for us. - It's Edgar. Go, go! - Come on! Go, go! Turn back, go! Hollis! No! Hollis! Who, what is this? Don't be afraid, there's nothing to worry about. You're safe now. Welcome, Four. Tris Prior, it's an honor to meet you. How do you know our names? What the? Oh oh. Welcome to the future. We've been waiting for you. Our plasma globes will protect you from the toxicity. Hey. - We're going to be okay. - Yeah. Look. This is incredible. This is insane! Get out. It's Tris. Welcome, to the Bureau of Genetic Alter. My name is Matthew. Now, let's get you into decontamination. That's her, Beatrice Prior. She made it. There's nothing to worry about. You're being decontaminated from the toxins which plague our world. Please remove your clothes and place them in the incineration hatch. Please step forward. Place your feet on the mark. You're clean. Please place your arm into the tube in the wall. There's nothing to worry about, Tris. Please place your arm into the tube. I've never felt so clean in my life. That was the best weird shower I've ever had. A little cold thou. Hey, yours is different. Why they are all different? Hello, and welcome to the Bureau of Genetic Welfare. In the early part of the 21st century, scientists first discovered a way to map then edit the human genome. You can choose to settle from "merely adequate" or you can choose "excellent". A genetic solution puts you in control of your life. So, why just hope for a better future, when you can choose perfection? Choose Perfexia. But, what started as an attempt to erase humanity's fault, almost erased humanity itself. Genetic modification deepened the rifts between people. And as they got more entrenched, the world began to tear apart, until humanity crossed a line, from which it could never return. In the ashes of civilization, a small group of genetically unmodified individuals established the "BUREAU OF GENETIC WELFARE." here in Chicago's O'Hare Airport. Our mission is to oversee a grand experiment to purify the human genome. That experiment is the city of Chicago. Your participation in the Bureau's work means you are now the guardians of the future. Your destiny begins today. Now. Please follow me. What's an airport? Life in the Bureau can be demanding. The work is worth every sacrifice. We don't have all the resources we would like of course, but I think you'll find your accommodations more than adequate - Whoa. - Wow. They're in person, here. - Who are they? - We bring them in from the Fringe. Get them healthy. Give them a second chance. - Hi, Four. - Hi, Four. Hi, Four. Hey. How do they know who we are. The experiment is the entire focus of the Bureau. Our Surveillance Technology is centuries ahead of anything you know in Chicago. They grown up watching you. Nothing creepy about that. You have to forgive everyone for staring, but... your arrival is the most exciting event some of us have ever known. Welcome to your new home. Where's Four? Did you hurt him? I told you I wanted them unharmed. He went with them. Willing. - But he's alive. - Did you hear what I'm saying? He betrayed you. No... - It's just love. - He's your son. He should be loyal. I'm loyal! Yes, you are! So, rest up. I need you ready to fight. What do you think? I think they've been studying us for 200 years and we need to catch up. We're going to give it a chance, right? Yep, of course we are. I wish we were alone. Excuse me. The Director's ready to see you. No, I'm sorry. I mean Tris, alone. We can't go together? Since you were the one who opened the box which invited you here. The Director would like to thank your personally. I'll see you later. - Clothes. - Thanks. This way. Go ahead. Put your wrist under the scanner. Access granted. Pure. I just never imagined the world to be this big. Chicago is just one of 50 major cities that used to exist on this continent along. Beyond that is, oceans and more land than you can imagine. But it's all like this now? Yeah. All except for Providence. Which is why what we're doing here is so important, Tris. Hello. - You must be director. - Oh, please call me David. It is a pleasure to finally meet you. You must have so many questions. I'm a bit overwhelmed. I'm still processing it and all. Oh. Tris, I know you. I watched you being born. I saw the love that your mother and father had for you. I watched a little girl have a happy childhood and grow into a courageous young woman capable of making choices. Dauntless. Defying Jeanine. Saving Chicago. To your people, you are a divergent. To the Council, you're a freak. To me, you are a a miracle. David. are you-are you aware what's happening in Chicago right now? Of Course. Yes. The people at Erudite really made a mess of things, but I don't want your to worry about that. Restoring order in Chicago is as important to me as it is to you. It's the only way to save the "damaged". What is the "damaged". The genetic alterations had disastrous consequences. Too brave and you're cruel. Too peaceful and you're passive. Too smart, and you'll lose compassion, like your brother. - Caleb's "damaged"? - Yes. For nearly 200 years, the greatest scientific minds have lived here to test a theory. If we can rescue genetically damaged people from the toxic environment in the Fringe. and put them in a safe place like Chicago, then perhaps over time, man's genetic material would heal itself. Return to its original form. And I'm one of those people? You're the only one. That doesn't- That doesn't make any sense Four is divergent. There's lot of divergences. Not divergent, Tris. Pure. You're genetically "pure". The rest are still "damaged". - Four? - Damaged. Not as much as Caleb, but "damaged". If we can understand what made you, maybe we can use that knowledge to help the "damaged". What does this have to do with Chicago? I answer to the Council. They're the ones who ultimately determine our fate. Yours and mine. I'm going to bring you with me to Providence to meet them. When they see that it's possible, that you were possible, it will change everything. I understand it's hard to take my word for it. But, if you don't believe me, believe your mother. My mother? Your mother, Natalie, wasn't born in Chicago. She was born in the Fringe and rescued by the Bureau. No, that's impossible. See for yourself. What are these? They're your mother's memory tabs. With them, you can watch the world through her eyes. What do I do? Place one on each temple. Natalie, come on! I'm not Natalie. We need to hide! Come on! They're coming! Run! The Fringers! Run! The Fringers! I'm not Natalie. Natalie, no! No! Bureau soldiers! Left! Flank left! Keep right! Keep right! Keep right! We're taking you to the Bureau. You're safe. You don't have to be afraid anymore. - How many more did you save today? - Not enough. We never get enough. Chicago has got to work, David. It's the only hope for us. From the ashes of civilization, a small group of genetically unmodified individuals established the Bureau of Genetic Welfare, here at Chicago's O'Hare airport. You're safe. a grand experiment, to purify the human genome. You're safe now. Your destiny begins today. Tris. In a moment of need, your mother did something that no one had done before. She volunteered to leave the safety of the Bureau to enter the experiment herself. She did this because she knew the "damaged" were worth saving. She believed in the experiment so much she was willing to be a part of it. If I can show the Council your miracle can be replicated, then her life's work is complete. The Council will be force to look at any human being, No matter where they were born, is worthy of life. Help me. You saved a city. Help me save the world. It was amazing. It was like I was her and seeing it all through her eyes. I still can't believe my mom is from this place. Well, I can see why she left. Do you trust him? David. I trust her. Yeah. Access denied. Tris. Access granted. Here you are. You ready? Say hi to David for me. Tobias Eaton. You've been assigned to me. I am Nita. Let's go. Why isn't everyone allowed upstairs? That would be one of the Council's many rules. Certainly not mine. The Separation, I don't like it. I agree, and in time, that won't be necessary. But Tris, I don't know who told you that being different is a bad thing. Because I know it wasn't your mother. Now I know I can replicate this. All I need is time. Look, Regina, let's talk. You seem like a nice lady, but... I'm really not a desk job kind of guy. I get claustrophobic. I need to be where the action is. The job of Surveillance is to keep tabs on the developing situation in Chicago. This is where the action is. Hayes, this will be your pod. Prior, you're next door. Resistance is growing. Evelyn is beginning to respond. Watch what's happening, file a report. Wait. What... Hold on. I just escaped from Chicago. Now you're saying, I got to sit here and watch it for the rest of my life? With Caleb? Perhaps you prefer to be banished to the Fringe? Ah. This Surveillance technology is incredible. - Whoever created it, is a genius. - Well, thank you. It was a labor of love. Ass kisser. Keep it up, Prior. And you, get to it. It's an awful lot of firepower. The Fringe is full of dangerous people. Put this on. - What are these? - Personal drones. Expands your field of vision and provides 3D modeling and environments. Just like old times in Dauntless, huh? Except there is nothing old about any of this. Here. Thanks. Activate the head gear. The left hand activates the drones. FOUR Does it do anything else? Not much. Use the drones to find the targets. It will take you a while to get the hang of it. Yeah. Okay. Identified. Target Identified. I think I got the hang of it. Can I ask you a question? - Yeah, of course. - If mother was born in the Fringe, then, how did she end up in Chicago. I mean, you couldn't just sent her through the gate, right? No. Now, the Council's always careful how they introduced any new element to the experiment. Right. But, when they need to, they intervene. Yes. So, why aren't they intervening now? They will. We just have to make our case. - Can I still count on you to help me? - Yes. Can I count on you? Jeanine never had a chance against you. The sooner we get finished, the sooner we leave for Providence. The Allegiant. That's what you're calling yourselves. Amity just doesn't seem appropriate anymore. So, what exactly are you allegiant to? The faction system? The factions kept Chicago peaceful for a long time. Well, I wouldn't know about that because I was forced out of my faction. I gave up my life, my child, everything. I understand your anger, Evelyn, I do. - But the way forward... - The way forward has already began. I know I said I'd be alone, but... I'm not Candor and I'm not Amity. So I will lie and I will fight if I have to. You see these scars? I wasn't born Amity. And I can assure you I'm not afraid to fight for what I believe in. It seems like we're 2 peas in a pot. But it doesn't have to be this way. We can come to some sort of agreement. - Get back! - Get down! - Get out of here! - Let's go. - Go! - Go. Alright, Caleb. Keep me posted if anything changes, alright? - Hi. - Hey. Caleb said that some of the Dauntless are lining with Johanna. But the rest of Candor are still solid with Evelyn. Things are finally out of control. Did David say anything about what he can do? Yeah, once we talk to the Council, then the Bureau can step in. So, it all hinges on the mysterious Council, does it? - What if they say no? - David is confident that they won't. David, right. You know, I found out why I can't go upstairs. I'm "damaged", and you're "pure". I know. You know. When were you going to tell me? I don't know. I... - I guess I didn't think that it matter. - Why doesn't it matter? Because it doesn't make a difference if you're "pure" or you're "damaged". You're still the same person to me. Look. I know that it's not perfect, by any means, but... The Bureau saved my mother from the Fringe. I wouldn't be here without her. What do you actually know about what they do in the Fringe? You know what they tell you. - Yeah, but... - I'm sorry. He needs you upstairs. He needs you upstairs. Those people are nice, weird, but nice. Yeah. They're definitely weird, that's for sure. You better get used to it. - Really? - Yeah. Next time you go to the Fringe, I want in. You're not ready. I'm going. Tris. I'm more than aware that the separation has been difficult for you and Four, but... I've watched you both enough to know that I think the two of you are going to work it out. We're fine. Everything's fine. Good. Let's get to work. Here we go! Fall in people! The weather's clear, we're green for a run! - You, let's go, let's go! - Come on, come on. - Move! Let's go! - Get ready to go! Let's go! Alright, here's the deal. Listen up! This may be a Humanitarian mission, but the dwindle settlement is very dangerous. - Everybody clear? - Yes! - So, what's the life span out here? - 25 to 30 years. But if we get people early, they can live up to 50 or 60 in the Bureau. Dauntless, if it's up to me, you would not be out here. I know you think it was tough in Chicago, but this is the Fringe. - Understood? - Yes. The mission is to save as many kids as possible. They grow up in hellish conditions. But, you have your weapons handy, you stick to protocol. I don't want to lose any one. Get out your weapons. Come on, let's go! Go! Go! Go. We got to move! Drones! Go! Help! Stop. Stop, stop. Hey, hey, hey. It's okay. I want my dad. Please! No! No! Dad! Everything will be fine. Let's go. Let's go. Come on! Run! Searching Target. This way. This way. Target identified. Go! - Stop! - Just stay away from us! - Calm down. We're here to help. - We don't need your help. - I just want to talk to you. - I'm not going to lose my family! Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop! - Let go! Get away! - Get off him! Get off him! Don't touch my boy! What did you do? Come on. It's okay. It's alright. - I want to see my dad. - I know, I know. Four, let's go! We got to move! It's alright. It's okay. Go! We got to go, we got to go. It's okay. Come on. Come on. - Romit! - Don't. What the hell is going on here? Just do you job, Dauntless. Let's go! Move! Let's go! One man, two children. Get them on the plane, go! Get back here! No! I said, shut up. All of you. - Hey. - You, stop! It's called a soap, you should try it. What's up, Stiff? You lost? I wanted to see Four. David and I are leaving for Providence. On a first name bases with the director, huh? - You work fast. - Peter, can you leave her alone. I don't need you to defend me. Attention! Get us ready for Providence. I want my ship within an hour. - Yes, sir. - Follow me. David, hey. I was wondering if I can talk to you about my job. You know, I'm not really a typist and... Or if you are busy today, I get it. Totally fine, we'll talk tomorrow. Good idea. Thank you. I need to talk to you. What is this, Nita? Vaccinations. What do you mean, vaccinations? We weren't given vaccinations. Four. Look at this. Hey. What's your name? My name? Hey. - I'm sorry about your dad. - My dad? - Alright, I'll see you back at base. - Yep. This is not a humanitarian mission. We're not saving kids, we're stealing them. This is what we do. Now you know. David takes them out from here, wipes their memories with the gas, and raises them in the Bureau. If you take away what they know, then you take away who they are. Yeah. I think that's the point. They were all unarmed. I won't surrender to this. Round up anyone who's left. We take the fight to Evelyn. Yeah. I'm loading up. Let's go. Move it. Today we take Evelyn down! Whatever it takes! This is all real time. I mean, this Surveillance Technology they have in place is extraordinary. Caleb, can you get out of your head for a second? This is our home. There's going to be a war. Where are you going? I'm going to do something about it. Four, what are you trying to do? Getting Tris. We're leaving. You can't go up there. - What do you think you are doing? - Four! - You cannot be in here. - Four. - It's not going to work. - Pure. Central elevator has been compromised. - Hey. - We're leaving. - What? - Right now. What? I can't. You don't understand yet, but these people have been lying to you. Lying? What are you talking about? Look, whatever they told you. They've been... Put the guns down. He's been stealing children from their families. We're giving them a better life. - By killing their parents? - It was an unfortunate accident. Sir. One terrible accident doesn't mean that it was the wrong thing to do. Tris, This is not the place that we thought it was suppose to be. If you have enough to save one person, and your choice was between a healthy child or a sick old man, - who would you choose? - I wouldn't choose! Good, now they're both dead. We have to go. Tris. We're going back to Chicago, we shouldn't ever have left. - No, we have to wait. - Yeah, we've been waiting. Okay, David is not the person that you think he is. Four, you know nothing about David. You've no idea what we've been working up here. What have you been working on? Do you have any idea what is going on out there? Yes, of course I do. Why do you think we're going to meet with the Council? Tris. I want you to listen to me. Tris. You're coming with me. I have to go. You're making a mistake. You ready? Yeah. Autopilot engage. You want to go back to Chicago, I'll take you. No, thanks. You want to walk cross the Fringe, I don't think so. There's no rule saying you can't go home, Four. Come on. - Yeah. - I'll go with you. All set. Take us to Chicago. Look, I understand how you're feeling. But... What you're about to do has ramifications for people all over the world. If Four doesn't see that, it's not your fault. David never wanted you to see what you saw, out on the Fringe. He keeps tight control. Nothing happens without his approval. And his ship, is the only one that can fly through the camo wall. Why are you telling me this? We are not taking you to Chicago. Hold on! Welcome to Providence. I can see why they don't want to share it. Some day, the whole world is going to look this beautiful. So, as you can see, there are multiple genetic markers supporting this conclusion. Standard personality test. Behavioral evaluations. Stimulus response. She's passed them all with flying colors. It all sounds great assuming it's the truth. Phillip. David has lied to us before, haven't you, David? I like to hear from the girl. Well, I don't know why she can't tell you anything I'm not. Indulge us, David. This must all come as quite a shock to you, Miss Prior, finding out that you are pure Um. Pure. I'm not even sure what's that suppose to mean. But yes, it is shocking to me. Shocking that the more I learn about the past, the more I feel like... you're all making the same mistakes over and over again. - Tris, this is not the way. - Let her speak, David. What mistakes, Tris? The human beings cannot be categorized in this way. It doesn't work. Maybe it's time to start embracing everyone instead of dividing them into groups. Regardless whether they are 'pure' or they are 'damaged'. - That isn't what we're here to discuss. - Well, it should be. Look, I know that all of this is just an experiment to you, but these people in Chicago are real. And they're in a war right now because of divisions that you created, and you are doing nothing to help them. David has control over the administration of Chicago. He's only here to extend his funding. Which, we would be happy to do, but if things are as bad as she says, David. Shouldn't you get your house in order first? You said that you couldn't do anything. I am doing something. I'm bring back the factions. What? Why? I hope the Allegiant will take care of the problem for me. The factions work, Tris. They keep the peace, they created you. I never should have trusted you. You want change with no sacrifice, you want peace with no struggle. The world doesn't work like that. You okay? I'll be fine. I hope the Bureau isn't far. I need to get to Chicago, and tell Evelyn she's got a lot bigger problem than Johanna. You'll need this, to get through the camo wall. We need your help, Tobias. You don't know what he's capable of. What about Tris? As long as she stays in the Bureau, she's safe. She's too valuable to him. I'll need a head start. When David asks, I want you to tell him that I left you behind. Okay? - Why? - Because Tris will know you're lying. SCANNING PURE @ MATTHEW.B ACCESS GRANTED There was an accident. There was turbulence, not more than any other storm, but... The lightning, maybe. - We just went down. - Where's Four? I don't know. I passed out, when I cam to, everyone was dead. Four left me behind. Okay, we search the settlement, search the Fringe. Make sure he's not there. Don't worry. We'll find him, I promise. Four would never leave anyone behind at the crash site. Yeah. He told me you would say that. Four is trying to make his way back to Chicago. - Peter. - Hello, David. I didn't think that you knew my name. I know all of the important people from Chicago. Really? Well, if I'm so important, then why did you give me such a terrible job? We all have to make sacrifices. I don't see you making any. Peter. I need help with something in Chicago. What's in it for me? Well, if you do well, you can have any job you want. Except mine. Do you know where Peter is? Uh, he's not in his pod? No. No, I don't know where he is. Is there something that I can help you with? Can you find Four? You can't tell anyone. Okay, of course. Anything you need, Beatrice. Come on, Four, where are you? Evelyn. We found him outside the wall. Take it off. Where's my son? I don't know. Edgar told me what's out there. So you better start talking, or we'll be holding your trial now! No, you won't. Because I have something that you need. Really? And what's that? The way to win your war. - Hey. - Hey. Any news? No. I'm sorry. Tris! - Did you find him? - Yes, I found Four. And there's something else you're going to want to see too. Okay, go. Over there! That's him! We got him! Four. Don't worry, he's fine. Just... keep watching. What is this place? You're going to love it. What is it? Try it out. You'll see. Just don't try it on anyone you like. I was wondering when you'll have the courage to face me. 3 weeks you leave me here. I run a faction! I protected our son from Jeanine's thugs. Protected him. Is that what you call it? Beating your own child. It made him who he is. Make sure he gets a good dose. Tobias, I was trying to make you to be better. Tobias, I was trying to make you to be better. I'm-I'm sorry, but... Who you are? Just imagine if you release this on the Allegiant. Not even Johanna will remember a time that you weren't in charge. Who exactly told you about this? You have a very powerful friend on the outside, if you choose to engage instead of prepare. - Does this friend have a name? - David. David? You can tell my friend I'm not going to use that thing unless it's a last resort. Why would David support Evelyn? It doesn't make any sense. Are you okay? I was worried about you. Evelyn, you need to make peace with the Allegiant. No, Johanna made her choice. I never wanted this war. But I will end it, I promise you. You have no idea what you are up against. - Johanna is not the issue. - Look. I know you're angry at me and I understand that. I'm just... I never meant... This is so hard for me too. I don't want to have to keep you in here. Then, let me out. I can't, I have responsibilities. One day, you'll understand that, but right now I need you to stay here. I'm going to finish this. One way or another. How are you going to finish this? Hey, don't worry. You won't have to be here for long. What-What are you talking about? Well, Evelyn is deciding now, If she use the memory serum, Chicago might forget it's own name. We have to go. Get Christina and meet me outside. Where are we going? Home. Access granted. How's it going in Chicago? Making sure it's safe from Evelyn and the factionless? Tris. You need to forget about Chicago. You know, it's really funny, David. You've been watching me for years and you don't know anything about me. You're wiping the memories of everyone in Chicago, aren't you? - Alright. Uh... - You were never supporting the Allegiant. These people treated you terribly, they killed your parents. - Four is there! - Oh, Four. Yes. Yes. Four is there. But he's "damaged", just like the rest of them. Where are you going? I'm taking your ship and I'm not come back. You can't fly. Watch me. Autopilot engage. Tris Prior is stealing my craft, bring her back. Hurry. - Cristina, these are for you and Tris. - How did you know we were leaving? You're not the only ones who hate David. - Hey, come on! - Thank you. - Hold it! - Get in, get in. Hands to yourself or I'll throw you out. Let's go rescue Four. Looks like 3 ships are following us. - Plasma craft engaged. - Surround her. Give her a nudge towards the ground. The autopilot will bring her down safely. What are they trying to do? They're trying to bring us in for a landing! I'm going manual! - Pull up! Pull up! - I'm trying! I'm trying! Altitude I got it. Your order, sir? Shoot her down. Before she reaches the camo wall. You can't follow her through. We're dead. We're gonna die! We're gonna die! Hold on. We're getting close! - Ho! - Whoa! There has to be a way to shut off the gas. Look at the ventilation system, it's all over the city. Down there. Johanna. We got here just in time. It's time, Evelyn. You said, the gas was a last resort. Well? How do think your trial is going to end? Let me know the second the serum is released. You got it. Good luck. Thank you. How do these drones work? Turn your headgear on. - And? - Watch and learn. Stop right there and drop your weapons! Hey, hey! Whoa! Hey, what are you doing? Put me down! Alright, this one is on you. - Easy! - Sorry! Stay where you are! That's my girl. Recon. Screw this! I'm out of here! What the hell is that? Hey. I'm sorry. I never should have trusted him. You do what you thought was right. I love you. We should find Evelyn. Come on. Serum Status: Ready. Now. If you press that button, We're complete safe inside the vault. And... No one else will ever know what happen to them. Your choice. Initialize: Serum vaporization Guys. Guys. They just initiated the serum. Did you find a way to shut it off? Not yet. This way. It's locked. I'll see if I can get into the Control room. Evelyn, you have to stop this right now. I... I do want to do this, but I have to. I'm the only one who knows how to save Chicago. I was right to close the gate, but no one listened! No one! Not even you. The Allegiant, brought this on themselves. Evelyn, that serum is not just going to wipe the memories of the Allegiant. It's going to do it to the whole city. What? Whatever they told you was a lie. What... - Come on - Evelyn. I want to stand by your side. But what you do to the city... ...you do to me. Mom. Tobias. I won't know who you are. Don't do it. Please. Don't No! That's why he picked a guy like me for a job like this. I hope you're watching, David! Cristina, have you figured out the door yet? Once it's locked from the inside, the door won't open. Well, keep trying! Begin serum release. Don't breathe it in! Don't breathe in the gas! Caleb, we're running out of option here! Hold on. I think I found something. There's a choke point where the vapor gets pumped out. Cut their comm line to the ship. Caleb? - Caleb? - Tris? Tris, can you hear me? Caleb! I'm going in. What! Oh shit! What the... - Make it stop! - It's locked! - Open the door! - Open the door! Peter, open the door! I will find you, Peter. Tobias. You're okay. Damn it! - Can you stop it? - No. Caleb, do you hear me? Caleb, where are you? Caleb Prior! Sorry. Keep going. Stay with me. Tris, look at this. It's really smart. So, they ran the pipe into the air duck. Caleb, focus. Just tell me where it is. It's right here. There's an isolation valve that controls the flow of the air. But, I don't know how you're going to get down there. I do. Four! Go! Tris, it's at the end of the hall. Close the doors. Tris, I control everything. I can even seal the room you're in right now. Just stop fighting. There's another way. Down the stairs. This is foolish, just stop. I made you. You might as well be my child. Which is what you're acting like. A spoil child. Tris, at the end of the hall. There's another way on the left. It's over, Tris. Searching target. Searching target. Searching target. Target identified. There you are. You're right, David. It is over. NO! Serum release halted. How's that for "damaged". Clear. It's clear. It's not here. Clear. Clear. We did it. That's what you do for family. Caleb, there's one more thing I want you to do. I want to send a message to David. My name Tris Prior. And I'm here to reveal the truth. There are others who exist on this planet They do not view us as equals. They called themselves the "Pure", and they called us the "damaged". They created a wall to divide us from their world. And factions to divide us from each other. Hello! Come on! You think you can ditch me like this? You got me to do your dirty work and then just, wiped me away like the rest of them! We had a deal, pal! We're their experiment, and it almost destroyed us. I set the autopilot right for our friend's neighbourhood. Along with a little surprise when it goes through the camouflage wall. They tried to make us forget who we are and where we're from, but they did not succeed. So, here we stand together, not as 5 factions, but as one city. We're gonna tear down their wall. Hey. What's going on? I want the penthouse! Yeah, that's right! Or... a room in that really cool upstairs area. Okay, look! I'll even take my old bunk back! Just come on and open the damn door! Please! You've seen us, and now, we see you. To those of you beyond the wall, hear me loud and clear, because I know you are listening. Chicago is not your experiment. It is our home. And it always will be.
