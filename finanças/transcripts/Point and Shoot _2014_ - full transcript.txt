My name is... My name is Matt VanDyke. I am 29 years old. I Wear a special knife by Smith & Wesson. The blade extends. It's a simple pocketknife. It's a fine blade with partial serrated edge. I also wear a knife, attached to the tibia. For cutting ok, mainly intended for piercing. And that's the bulletproof vest. In addition to body armor and jacket I wear a helmet, of course. This helmet has a camera holder. In the next video clip I come back to it. Last fall, I met Matt VanDyke. He was, as he told me, at home in Baltimore, when the revolution broke out in Libya. rebels fighting Muammar Gaddafi, the dictator of the country. When Matt heard about the uprising, he took off, to join the rebels. In his pocket he had a video camera with me. - Ok, are you ready? - Yes. How someone came from Baltimore to to fight in a Libyan revolution? I do not know. Were there any influences in early adolescence? As a child I read always Choose Your Own Adventure - Books. This is a great whitewater adventure! My mother According to I was as a child very adventurous. I grew up with action movies on. I wanted to be a CIA agent. Then I wanted to be a spy. Movies impressed me very much. I'm the new Indiana Jones. In fact, I grew up protected and pampered on. Be careful, if you hochhebst the stones. I was the only child an only child of a single child. And I grew up in a house, where my grandparents with my mother and me lived. I was the center of the family. You see perhaps smart. As a student, I lived at home, in the basement. I did not have many friends. - Mighty General . - Majesty . Temporary I sat for 12 hours the piece played on the computer and. The victory is ours, Almighty. All my adventures were virtual. Not at all injured. Lawrence of Arabia I saw for the first time when I was in college. He was one of my favorite movies. - These are not ordinary men. - I do not want ordinary men. I decided to study the Middle East. And so I went the Georgetown University and took a master's degree in Middle East studies. But it was all purely academic and intellectual. I had never even have been in the Arab world. When I graduated, I did not know much about the real world. I still wanted to do something extraordinary. But here I was, mid 20th mother and grandmother bought my groceries and washed my clothes. I never even paid my bills. I had no work. I had to do something drastic. I needed quite quickly a change of course in my life. And I suggested the most serious way at all a. A crash course to become a man. One day I was sitting at home and watched on television Alby defect. He is an Australian filmmaker of the 70s and 80s. He embarked on a multi-year journey on, took all possible crazy adventure in Africa and so on. And he produced some very popular films in Australia. Everything OK? He had this blond haired and was somehow dressed funny, with cut-off jeans, no shirt. But his films was something intrinsically, the very approached. He was like a Hollywood hero from real life. And instead of simply other people to film, he took himself and his adventures on. He was exactly what ... Such a life I wanted to lead. And I decided, Travel Adventure Movies how to make use of Alby defect. Ok, this is the first shot with the new camera. I bought a camera and a motorcycle. I wanted a cutting-edge World Adventures documentary rotate. It should my crash course will be in terms of manhood. And I wanted to hold on film. Did you hoped by such a film and your actions therein and your role in front of the camera, to the transfer on real life? Yes. Yes, it was. I wanted to be different. I wanted my life to redesign, with the camera as a tool. I was sure that he wanted to do something, MATTS GIRLFRIEND the him to be more independent and more responsibility would force for his daily life. Lauren is responsible and somehow down to earth. She is on permanent contracts and holding me with their rational nature to a little more realism. This was one reason why I found, the trip would do him good. For all that he would have to do it yourself. No one else would be there, to help him or do for him. That's a fabulous recording. The coming into the film. Monkeys, what are you doing? Let go. Heaven. Ok, I'm in Gibraltar, to the Pillars of Hercules. Behind me is the first what I saw of Africa. And here it is. It was very quaint and very ... Likewise, I would have Screenplay moderately provided. I saw a camel. I thought, "Wow, I'm really here." I film and photograph. Only I had of their culture do not know. For example, there were a lot of guys, The hands went around holding. I called Lauren and said: "Morocco is very progressive. They go very open with homosexuality. " And she said: "You idiot, Men stay there on their hands. " I marveled. "Really? I did not know." When I tried to use the toilet, there was a squat toilet. I had no idea, including the bottom hole served. In the end I used the shower as a toilet, which was really disgusting. Actually, it was atrocious. Wait a moment. Everything OK? I have this problem already, since I was about 16. '/ i> In high school I began to me compulsively often to wash your hands. A psychiatrist turned to me an obsessional neurosis fixed. Or OCD. My OCD manifests itself as fear before various things as phobias. I'm no garbage can. would sugar on me, I would feel defiled. The effect ranges from merely annoying to extremely stressful. Everything is ok, right? I just want to make sure, I snapped at no, when I stopped. to my OCD heard the constant fear, inflicting other damage accidentally. I drive down the street about a pothole, I think involuntarily, that was a man? I drove someone to? 30 km further, I turn to perhaps and go back to reassure myself. Ok, this is an OCD recording. Is because of me perhaps someone fallen from the rock? Probably not. I think it's ok, right? My mind knows it is not real. But mentally I'm hard going of it. From here no cars are to be seen, which came against something. Even so a fucking OCD video. The use of a helmet camera brought relief with them, because I let them just run and see afterwards could. But even with the helmet camera I gave the urge to look back and align it so that I my fear and yes held on film. And then, when I saw once on the shoulder, came a car just up to me. An incredible Moroccan driver drove on the wrong side. I dodged and built an accident. On that day I broke my collarbone. Can you see that? Does it look bad? What can I say? I had a motorcycle accident and broke my collarbone. Yes, and so ... So the adventure ends for now. Ok, let's go. But after the accident, I got to deal with the anxiety. From the hotel room in Morocco I called Lauren to and wailed, me not to be trusted out of the room. She asked me: "Why are you such a coward?" The set went after me for years. Still I ask them ... Every now and then I ask them still, if she thinks I'm a coward. That no longer went out of his head, it has hurt him. He noted, however, that I was right. Wore the then Further to all in or not? Who ... I mean ... Who already knows? Who can say? She would have liked to undo. But ... Then I drove back and took the bike. I decided to rattle all similar countries. was longer in Tunisia. transit to Egypt. By Jordan. through Syria. I tried to see everything, went back and forth about. And I filmed everything. I sat no longer just watching TV or read about other people. At last I saw my own adventure. It was incredible. In total I drove more than 56,000 kilometers on this bike. What better I've never experienced before. Damn, I was almost there. And then I built an accident. Waved a car in vain for help. Damn it all. I know me no advice. The bike is too heavy. a motorcycle movie to rotate alone, is exceedingly difficult. Sometimes I drove somewhere high, made a tripod with the camera on and then went down, take about myself. The whole process took half or a whole hour, for a probably not used shooting. I brought with me, to ride on the rear wheel. Now I am very keen. I want to bring the In every shot. There is an urge, I must resist. Otherwise it would look, as I would put on a show. Oh man. Yes! Great! The problem with adrenaline only, that you need more of it. Adventure is a little like a drug, the effect wears off. Then you need more of it. BAGHDAD, IRAQ I contacted a newspaper, The Baltimore Examiner. "you done for me the paperwork, I do embedded journalism. " They said: "That's great. We can not even afford, To foreign reporters Football games to send. " Now they had a war correspondent. OK let's go. If your man. - Is your husband. - If your man! experience War for the first time at close range, was like in the movie but not like in the movie. - People, it's a cow. - We have no cow. The video camera is rolling. The soldiers asked me to film them, as they occurred as soldiers. Even though they were indeed those the camera should characterize their image. Take me well upon entering on the door. In earnest? Thou shalt do that? - Are you ready? - Go! - My God, you're going to destroy it. - I went to. - Is that stupid. - Open. If you already. Ok, now make a recording of it. - Wait a moment. - Of what? What are you doing... First check! Verifiable first time, seriously. Come on. The soldiers were very kind to me, especially when I told them about my film. The night vision is good. Yes that is her. She's better than I thought. How are you going to call him? How are you going to call your film? Do not know yet. There were times in Iraq, where I had the feeling to have to stand in front of the camera. Not that I necessarily had wanted to be a soldier, but ... I did not want to be mere documentarist. I wanted to take effect on what happened. Not only watch. Matt, you shoot? Sure, of course. Hey, alternate on a target for him. During my stay I learned a lot, what to me later in Libya was useful. So it is closed. And then you can shoot. How am I doing? Damn good for someone who never sees. I'm just saying, it hits the mark. I look at my card. IRAQ Map of Iraq. Probably one the worst counter cards Manufacturer of International Travel Maps. What are you doing ... movies? That's strange. We chatted. It was not that I for months nothing heard from him. I mean, we ... From almost every country he visited, he could regularly send emails. We performed video conversations and ... So I could see him and the changes witnessed. I heard him talk about it, what he had seen, whom he met and where he had come. And it was awesome. Fantastic. This is my completely filthy hotel. Here it is absolutely disgusting. Is that a wire under power? Explore the. My OCD to be able to shoot with a camera, helped me to curb it. Explore the walls. It seemed to me as if I'm Matthew VanDyke outgrown. I was without my family over there, to fend for myself, and did things, would have the Matthew VanDyke never done. A new name seemed right. My name is Max Hunter. I am 29 years old and going to Afghanistan. Max Hunter. Max Hunter was a boastful, smug, ridiculous fearless, ruthless guy, the shine and wanted to be famous and all these things. strongly influenced by Hollywood movies. And at first I did my best, to show the front of the camera. But with the time sat my riper I also cinematically through. We all need our thrill, right? And so I get my. I began to do crazy things easy, as I realize now. Things that I would not do now. I drove through Iran. over the border. came through Afghanistan. I got dressed as an Afghan to. I let my beard grow and added me visually pretty good one. I bought sawed-off shotguns, I for self-defense carried with me. Finally, I came to Kabul. I traveled about the country, was attacked by villagers. A cop hit me in the face. A couple of times I was arrested. my passport I had in my pocket. - Fire. - Fire. For a while I was at US soldiers. Eighth side - On the shell casings. - Is clear. The more I did, the more I wanted to do. And the more I survived, the more I settled on a danger. I was looking for Osama bin Laden's old house in Jalalabad on. I snuck onto the property and planted in the ruins an American flag on. A brick as a souvenir I have today. It was a very dangerous undertaking. It's a miracle that I survived. Eben has bitten me a wild dog. So it looks. A crazy adventure followed the next. Although I in these years turned hundreds of hours of footage, escape me the most important key moment my whole trip. And that was my meeting with Nuri. Nuri and his cousin traveled mainly on foot through Africa. And Nuri was a hippie. He had a lot of hair and spoke about peace and love. He was a great Libyans and my first. So I had not imagined Libyans. That Nuri and I were friends, came a bit surprising to me. Finally, I am not just a hippie. I'm more conservative stock and I have OCD. But Nuri is one of the nicest people, which I have ever encountered. He is... To me he was almost like a saint. Because of his way of thinking and kindness. A tolleren people I never got to know. We exchanged phone numbers, and Nuri recommended me Libya. Tripoli, Libya Americans were at that time no tourist visas for Libya. Thanks to a fairly large bribe I came to Libya. I thought this country was the greatest thing, what I had ever met. I drove around in the area and posed for photos in front of Gaddafi posters. I think Gaddafi was then for 38 years in power. The 38 was on the posters. I still can hardly believe it, that I'm here. It's almost like a dream. I called to Nuri and was with him and his cousin together. And I met these motorcyclists. They were very good friends of mine. When I went to high school, I did not have a lot of friends. There I was mostly a loner. My few friends I appreciate very much. The friends that I found in Libya, were dearer to me as almost all of my friends in America. Say something. I celebrate the birthday of the Prophet Muhammad. In a way, it seemed to me, when I would come home. And because of good friendships there Libya grew me right to my heart. Now that you're a Libyan. Referring to them? Merry Christmas. He came back ... Simply everything was better. I ... It sounds picked up, But things were looking up. And I was so excited and so relieved. I'll take you on straight. So it should be. On my return I was completely exhausted. I had enough of traveling. I told Lauren: "Now we can live normally." And then this happened with Libya. And all of these plans changed. In the Arab world is spreading a revolution with protests against the government. Tunisia this morning in chaos, after Protestants the president forced from office. Egypt witnessed the third day of massive protests. Even in Syria plan Protestants two days of violent actions against the local dictatorship. You want freedom. You want social justice and an end to corruption and deprivation. It's about democracy. It's about personal freedom. We need freedom! From Morocco to Iran there are protests in the Arab world. The governments in Tunisia and Egypt were toppled. Next is Libya there? February 2011th The revolution in Tunisia and Egypt spread to Libya. With simple protests it went off. But Gaddafi was shoot at the Protestants in Libya. Gaddafi should Death squads have deployed, the door to door Search by Protestants. People the wounded came to the hospital, disappeared from there and were executed. The suffering and bloodshed are unheard and unacceptable. Growing tensions PROTESTS widen to Libya OFF Foreign journalists be shown. These pictures were illegally taken with mobile phones, posted YouTube and circulated underground. Literally everyone were filming what is happening around him. It was like that, what I had done a lot more modest, and was a much more important purpose as my motorbike adventure. Four years earlier had my crash course started when it comes to manhood. And now the Arab Spring was going and put my idea of masculinity into question. What I had done was not against the protests on the streets of Tripoli. The protests were answered with bullets. The friends, I had found in Libya, still possessed an Internet connection. I chatted via online chat and e-mail with them. And they told me, her neighbor had been killed and her cousin been arrested and beaten. My friend Tariq took part in protests. Right next to him two people died by snipers. movies in the news are a. But if a friend tell, as they saw people, who were killed, gets the a completely different meaning. Back then, America was not involved, NATO and not the UN not. One of my friends asked: "Why not help us?" For me it was unthinkable to sit at home and far to see die while my friends. I called Lauren at work and said: "You have to come home. I'm flying to Libya. " Even for the same evening I took my reserve a seat on the plane. My mother drove me to the airport. In the car I taught the camera on Lauren, and they looked really pissed off. Actually, it came as no surprise. But I was furious. Not so much because he flew there, but because he still did it on that day. Without prior notice, without time, prepare something for him or anything else. I was mad. Today February 28, is and I'm in Cairo, Egypt. Tonight I'm going with a car to the limit. I hope I come across the border. I want to Benghazi. There I want to document what is going on, and as best we can help, to overthrow Gaddafi. Part of me was aware that it bordered on the absurd. The same fellow whose family it food and fresh linen supplied, traveled halfway around the world in a war. Muammar Gaddafi makes no move, in the 18-day battle for control to give in Libya. Gaddafi still seems to have the final say. But antigovernment groups check says that it a large part of eastern Libya. the limit. Damn it. Benghazi? OK. I called to Nuri. I told Nuri: "You, I come to Benghazi." And he said: "Yes, man, come here. That's great." And he said the in his usual hippie voice. I thought if I came to Benghazi, would Nuri same hippie, as I knew him. The hung around and spoke of peace and love. But Nuri appeared in Flakweste, battle suit and brimmed hat and was completely serious. When the war began here and all the troops Gaddafi's subtracted [from Benghazi] was ... overcame a feeling of freedom, as if you were flying. Something seemed to open in a, it was like fresh air. Yes, fresh air. As if you were in the highlands and might fly ... and would be safe. For sure. In Benghazi, we have already all this feeling. All, man. But the guys in Tripoli I'm still worried. This is the great hospital. All boys come from the fighting here. I hate guns. I want to kill no one who is from Libya. And not only from Libya, from all over the world. At the beginning of the war Nuri said ... I asked: "What will become of Gaddafi?" Nuri said: "He should just go, to go and live in his tent. " Not "I want to catch Gaddafi and kill him." In Nuri is no hate. Welcome to Benghazi. Today the sun shines. The sun is shining... Today in my city. Freedom People had small units formed. Most of them were civilians. A friend named Ali Nuri's was one of the rebels. Ali was there, began as the bombardment. Many died, but he survived. People Gaddafi bombed his car. And with this car we have to fight him. - For real? - Yes. - We are all riding in this car? - Yes. - For real? - Yes, - But we will repair it. - OK. We make it operational. OK. With heavy weapons, 14 1/2 [mm]. - You already know. - Yes. We back before. Nothing can stop us. I asked what we need, and Matt said: "We need the weapons." The Games begin. No matches. War. Great War. Nuri and Ali are in a government building [the rebels] and get us papers to arms procurement. About my life upside down, so nobody recognizes me as a foreigner. Hopefully lasts the war was not too long. Hopefully no one gets hurt. I pray that no one gets hurt. BASE Rajma Gaddafi Jets had bombed a rebel base. We were looking for ammunition, that was still functional. Ok, here we should find a gun. Do you see anything? At this time, Gaddafi's army much better equipped than the rebels. Be careful. Very few of the rebels had military experience. Many of them were never to deal with a gun. Go ahead, Nuri. Now unlock, yes. Adjusting to "R". On the other hand. When I joined the revolution, I had shot with a gun. So I had more experience when the boys and the group, with whom I was together. Who says I knew nothing about weapons? The other but also not. Good. The fighters in this phase of the war were fellows like us. Independent groups, small groups. weapon behind purely in the car, and off. Previously, I as an observer was have been in war zones. But this time I took an active part. It was a completely different feeling. I was in the middle. I was dressed like everyone else. I went the same risks. For the first time in my life I had the feeling, to do something really important. We are prepared for war, and at the same time we watched the war on television with. At that time Gaddafi was there, to win the war. The Armed Forces Colonel Gaddafi's are on the offensive. With their superior firepower they moved the front line many miles to the east, to the oil town of Brega. We decided to explore Brega. That would be the next target. We wanted determine defenses, the use of DShK and grenade launchers. Nuri had to do in the military base. He would not come with us. And that's why he survived. We were in Ali's house, before we went to Brega. And Ali said something, I'll never forget. That's the last meal. You know what that is? The Last Supper? No, it's not the last supper, no. - No no. - "No no"? - Last Supper, are you sure? - Yes. What will happen to him tomorrow? No idea. We went to Brega. There chatted still civilians. People had their children on the street. You did not seem worried. Suddenly the car stopped at. We had fallen into an ambush. Ben, you were with the rebel forces on the front line of Brega outside. Describe us the current situation. What is going? We were this morning with them, and they came under constant, heavy bombardment by Gaddafi's troops. I telephoned on 12 March a few minutes with him. He was on the road to Brega. The next morning, I woke up for some reason early on. It was a Sunday, and I woke up at 6 clock. I saw that Gaddafi's forces were advanced to Brega. It came on television. In all the years of his trips I always had terrified of this call. It never came to my mind, that the worst was, when no call came, if everything would remain silent. During the events I was hit in the head. For days I was once conscious, sometimes not. I do not know where I was. They drove quite a distance with me. And then I woke up in prison. The torture of a man in the room above me woke me. I was wearing a blindfold and was interrogated. They played the video recordings my camera. Nothing can stop us. It was a recording of Nuri. This last I said: "Nuri, you remind me every day to Why We Fight. " The interpreter said: "You never come to America." I bit my fingernails off. I cut my toenails using a plastic spoon from, I thought, Nails tearing out would include torture. But they never questioned me again. I thought the video recordings submitted them. You need to ask me anything. Everything was on film. Three times a day they took me out, to use the squat toilet. Night crawling bugs in my cell, were on the walls and sometimes to me, they lived in the toilet. Waste piled up, there were maggots. And my OCD was really bad. I reckoned, here to end my life. I sat down under the hole and looked to heaven. Because I thought American satellites would me can see in the roof through the hole. I sat there and sometimes twisted the face as horror, to convey the impression that I felt bad. Who saw me from the satellite, should think: "This American you have played badly. We need to get him out. " I began to me to make all kinds of worries. I was afraid, Gaddafi would have because of my shots people sent to Nuri and his family. I was afraid, Lauren would leave me. For years she had been patient. But you can not run away and accept, the girlfriend waiting, if one is years in prison. And my mother ... My mother was all alone. My parents divorced, when I was only a few years old. My father I never knew. I have no brothers or sisters. My decision to go to Libya, was so fatal not only for me, but also for my mother. Maybe it was all somehow silly and crazy. The whole thing. Perhaps were the last four years of my life an utterly foolish, senseless, reckless thing. Yes, I wondered if it was worth it. EXPLOSIVES Whether it was worth sacrificing my family and my future family with Lauren. It was a very hard time. Five and a half months I brought to in two different prisons. In fact, I was sitting in a cabinet and stared at the wall. At the end of the passage were the guards in front of the TV. Gaddafi held a press conference. I heard there was talk of a prisoner exchange. And it came to me. HUSH-HUSH Special message I heard Hillary Clinton of them spoke to trade me. BBC world news The US government negotiated on the exemption of Matthew VanDyke. It was on television around the world. every day it was in the news just about me. People brought their children to the prison, to accost me. People sang songs about me. This I heard all day. Matthew VanDyke. - We're fighting for your freedom . - freedom. Yes. Matthew VanDyke. But now I realize that none of this was real. Everything took place only in my head. There were auditory hallucinations, as a side effect of my solitary confinement. I know that now. I went there mentally to the dogs. To put it in two sentences: "This guy kept for the center of the war. What a narcissistic ass. " But it seemed to me I was disappeared from the scene. Mentally I compensated the, by saying: "No, there you still . You will be counted. People are looking for you. " In contrast to the fact, I had previously perceived: "People think you're dead." I was in five and a half months in prison. One day I heard a loud uproar. I immediately thought: "Now they come and kill me." Then I realized that there were prisoners. And it was the best day of my life. On the evening I sat on a couch in a house and saw my mother and Lauren on CNN, as they talked about my release. Yes, and that was an absolutely surreal experience. Tell us, as it was, than you after all this time finally again heard the voice of your son. It's just an amazing feeling. I was so happy. A weight seemed taken from me. It has been such a strange feeling in my stomach. It is difficult to describe. And it was just wonderful. I arrived at the hotel Corinthia. There were many press people there. I called Lauren and asked: "Is Nuri ok? Have you talked to him?" And she said: "Yes, he is doing well . But Ali drove the car. " I was the only prisoner. His body was found in a mass grave. I urge you, Now go home. You have a very difficult Experience undergone. I'm sure, Her mother wants to see you, and you should also with some people talk about what you've been through. I had a taste of life get in an authoritarian regime. This has changed me from the ground up. What I had experienced in six months, had Gaddafi for 40 years made with his country. Gaddafi has so many defrauded of her life and so many lives stolen. I felt guilt or remorse, for not having done enough. And then... then ... I felt like ... Laura asked me questions when I got home. I avoided her again and said: "First I want to Nuri ..." Now ... Freedom. No more prison. And then came Nuri. I was very relieved to see him. Nuri had a uniform for me. He had a gun on me. All these things he had set aside for me. It's like six months ago. We went to the Defense Department. Nuri explained what had happened to me. Are you from the press? Are you from the press? No, thuwar [revolutionaries]. My detention brought me a great credibility. This allowed me, me open to connect as Americans. You know, what I had been through, who I was. Everyone had talked about it. They were grateful to have me with him. you welcomed me, led to a Libyan dance, clapped and gave me a captured weapon. It was a lovely welcome. The Revolution had me again. How did you experience that? Yes it was... It was a nightmare. It was awful. Every morning when I woke up, I did not know where he was. I did not know if he was okay. When I went to bed at night, I did not know, where he was and what happened to him. I wanted him home. I made it very clear, I wanted his homecoming. She said: "So you're just. You need the thrill. " I said: "No, this is about a serious matter. This is the most important thing, what will I ever do in life. In this war, to help. " And I think they understood. Some will think, You should go home. Well, I do not know. People can think what they want. In the five and a half months of my detention the war changed dramatically. The NATO came into play. The war took very different trains at. Well, it was not only a few men in a car. Tripoli - Sirte - Benghazi LIBYA The fortune of war had turned in our favor. - USA? - Yes, USA. I was about a week in my brigade, as followers of Gaddafi from the desert came and a control raided one of us. We stop here and look after, what's going on, okay? Shahid [martyr]. That's when I really realized that was the role of the observer behind me. What is the situation here, man? The location is ... A checkpoint was attacked. - OK. - Nobody saw someone coming. In buildings over there they could have postieren people to look out for reconnaissance. You would have seen any attacker. The attack came at midday. - Middle of the day, yes. - You did not have anyone on the roofs. For what happened, there is no excuse. When I left the prison, I was someone else. I had recognized, just like I had escaped and I had to be much more careful. Take your finger please the safety pin. - That... - Yes Yes. Yes, please do not finger let the locking pin. - That's the spirit. - Yes. First use with the ... First use with the Katiba. Someone today attacked a checkpoint. More than a dozen boys dead. We are now in the desert and looking for the attackers. It used to be easy, both before as to be behind the camera. But at war is handling the camera difficult. He's uncomfortable because you look, although it is not played, feels like an actor. You have to be aware, how something works before the camera. Nuri, I try a different angle. And then you ask yourself, whether it is authentic and unsophisticated. What is my choice of words, What should I do? At the same time one tries to capture the reality. This is not easy. We need video recordings, as these guys fight. Sometimes I found Camera distracted from the actual off. The people should not think I was there especially for movies. because it was not. I now just pops off the camera, is therefore no longer talked about it. - I shoot at the camera. - Leave it. - Then Nuri does not talk more about it. - Let me see. - The camera. - Come on. But Nuri realized the importance of filming. This is history, man. And it is for the families [of soldiers]. - Because nothing should be missed. - Well, yeah. I also want to do all that, what the other thuwar make. And all the while I'm filming, but not as a cinematographer rumstehen in the area. So you fight with two hands. With rifle and camera. - Yes, it will be. - Yes OK. But again, in the Jeep, we came under fire. - Go! Los! - Go! Los! And I rushed out of the Jeep. Damn, Nuri! My gun is in the car. My rifle is in the Jeep. I'm trying to to fulfill a dual function. I want to influence events, they also documented. Nuri has his rifle in his hand and I my camera. In our shot, what should I do? I asked myself: "What am I. A filmmaker or a fighter? " Sirte, LIBYA Sirte was Gaddafi's hometown. Here he still had power. With the fall of Sirte would be the war is over. That we hereby first are at the front, you can see it, that there are green flags. The green flag was the flag of Gaddafi. Several explosions are heard. Probably NATO bombs. That's it, hopefully. Thank you for everything. That you came to the rescue. Now it is about peace, man. I thank you for everything. If the shooting come to you, I'll send you in a good coffin your mom. As a souvenir that you were here. Hey, what about there, right? Not good enough. It is not good. Come on, concerned with more weapons. When we came to Sirte, scored Gaddafi's people Building on us. You put snipers on. Where is the enemy? - No one can see him, man. - Nobody knows? This diehard followers would not arise. It was the meistgefilmte War history. Everywhere ran cameras. In the midst of fighting you could see people with cell phone cameras. In one hand the mobile phone camera, in the other, the AK-47. These guys was the idea of ​​war dominated by film and television. guys with machine guns stood in the middle of the battle on and covered the enemy with a bullet hail a. They wanted pictures of themselves, with a large gun. things that friends, family and women were able to show to impress them. Fared you like? Yes, I felt the same. Everyone wants something, to share it on Facebook. Everyone wants an idealized picture created is as he wants to be and how he wants to be perceived. I break a patrol by on Sirte, and these guys get ready. After taking a residential area We checked the houses, to make sure that there lurked no snipers. We are in a residential area and search for weapons. Otherwise no vehicle here, we are only three. I would prefer somewhere else. Gaddafi had a lot of weapons distributed to people. What could be found in those would not come to us to use. Gaddafi forces will attack this page and this page also. We were constantly under fire. That sounded like as in a film, and constantly over our heads. You do not know how high or low the shots coming, to be behind him a hit on metal hear. It makes ding! Then you know it's time for coverage, because that was just, but you're so jaded, that it only does not listen. The shots are pretty close. Very close. Everything OK? Even though I was in the war, went the OCD never go away. In my car was spilled sugar. This is a huge problem. still makes me worry sugar. The soles are a problem. According to another from a bowl to drink. Now it's your turn. Come on. Do it! War, Man! - Do it! Do it! Yes! - Yes! Yes! But in the face of my prison experiences and I was in the war, did not seem to be there, to put a cup to her mouth. Yes! Yes! Now you're a fighter. Hey. Okay, always slow. Ok, everything is ok. Sometimes Nuri brought and I pressmen for frontline. Engage anything else on. It was very strange. For in Iraq and Afghanistan I had filmed soldiers. And now I was the soldier. Matthew VanDyke from Baltimore fighting on the side of Libyan rebels, after only weeks earlier, was released from a Gaddafi prison. When I saw fighting in the news, confirmed this to me, that I was a real rebel fighters. It got to see the world. And here I belonged. 42 years for nothing. 42 years for nothing. In the war I experienced things as injuries and deaths, which bedeviled me. We can not process it all and not tell in front of a camera, with what arbitrariness the death in war strikes. everything is One minute well, people laugh and joke, and come in the next like Not the explosion, with the dead. This morning I told you. So a bloody day. Yes, I try to steer clear of hazards. Ok, I love you very much. A couple of times I called home via satellite phone on, that let me use a journalist. Ok, I will. Bye! With Lauren to talk, was not easy. Many thanks. It gaped extreme opposites. Life in the Arab Revolution and at the front is quite different as in Baltimore. She had it dealing with a recalcitrant pupil, I saw someone who was ablaze, or, the shrapnel a had torn his head. Yes, we lived in two very different worlds. Have you ever killed a man? Well ... One day, when in Sirte fighting walked toward their end, we had Gaddafi's forces huddled together on a small area. One of my brigade commanders spied an enemy in a window. You want me to shoot him. How many men? Until then, we were at war the enemy does not come so close, that we would be able to see his face. Maybe times the muzzle flash, not more. Or you knew was the enemy in that building or in that direction, and there you fired. That was new here. I had never shot at a man. My commander roared, I should up and shoot him, before he fled through the window. He is here! You can not see him because ... It is between these houses, you have to look there. I handed one of the rebel my camera and said: "Films that." Runs the camera? Did you get him? I'm not sure. - Go down. - I wait a minute. I was not sure if I had met him. Then saw one of the other, such as the fellow appeared at the window, looked around and slipped through the window. All of a sudden I felt internally torn. I feel myself... When I would have failed, because I missed my target. But at the same time is something happy in me, that I do not hit. Do you think something in you has missed him deliberately? No, I did not miss him intentionally. And that's with the nightmarish. Because I tried to meet him. I tried. I always had an idea, as I wanted to be. For years I had struggled, to be that way. But even I had to film me, as I was going to kill a man. What did the about me out? On October 20, the day after I had tried to kill the guy, we heard rumors of a Sirte fleeing convoy was stopped and Gaddafi probably been captured. Many of the rebels there took with phone cameras. What I would have done, I would have been there? The war seems to be over. When I was in prison, there was much, what I seemed to be able to do no more. Among them, to go to the beach. But one day went Nuri and I the sea. It was a dream. Watch out. We were just re-Nuri and Matt, a Libyan and his American friend to visit. No, man. My boots get wet. We found a carpet with Gaddafi's face on it. I told Nuri: "Go ahead, occurs his face, if you will. " But Nuri did not. He said: "Why do such a thing? It's simple ..." He did not want to be like Gaddafi. It was not about revenge. It was about freedom. Of five she broke into a "Crash Course" in order to become a man. Now when you look back, did you succeed? A photo ... I and the camels ... Yes, I've got it. A serious. Yes I have. Do I have.
