FATHER PILÓN ESTABLISHES HEPTA GROUP DEAD MEN DO NOT TALK A LECTURE BY GLORIA PALOMEQUE SEER AND PHARMACIST, HEPTA GROUP THE HEPTA GROUP REPORTS PARANORMAL EVENTS AT THE VERGARA PALACE PARANORMAL INVESTIGATION CASES INSPIRED BY REAL EVENTS THE PHENOMENA VISIT THE PALACE PHENOMENA Thanks again. No, thanks. Father, been a long time. We thought maybe you died. Don't you worry, my son. If I die, I'll send you a sign. - Right. This way. - Let's go back there. - Black or white? - Make the first one black. Anybody else come? - So far, you're the first. - Yeah. Thank you, my son. Edward Witten's M-theory... NEW HORIZONS IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS ...has its origins in string theory. According to which, all particles seem to... I promised the Cambridge people that we'd take them all out to eat tripe. - For dinner? Tripe? - Gerardo, come on. They're English. Mm, no, no. I can't have a meeting tonight. I'll see you in 20 minutes. So, we'll, uh, pick it up next week. H-Hang on. Wait, no. Don't erase it yet, please. Would an internship interest you? Here is your coffee, in a glass, naturally. - In a cup is a mortal sin, my son. - And a cup of water. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Carlos? - It has nothing to do with religion... - Excuse me. Sorry. I had a slight problem. - Hello. - This is Pablo Marimón. - He only believes in science. - I'm a student at Gerardo Plana. - Nice to meet you. - Lovely. He skips out and leaves us here with a skeptic. Uh, no, no. I'm very interested in parapsychology. From a scientific perspective, naturally. But I've read all your books, and I listen to your show every week. - Every Saturday? - Yes, ma'am. On Saturday nights, you should be out partying. You'll never get your 20s back, you know. And make that the last time you call me "ma'am," all right? - Yes, ma'am. - Very good. Lime blossom, double... on the rocks, the way you like it. Jesús, take this glass away from me as well, please. So, what's wrong? Carlos. He's trying to contact me, I'm sure. A picture of him fell over, and it got really cold... If you keep living in the past, it'll rob you of the present. So, where are those two, hmm? I'll bet this tea that Paz is totally swamped by the grandkids. Eyes of newt and legs of frog. Grandma's going to catch you and eat you all up! Wait. Just a minute now. Uh, Grandma needs... - Just a minute. - Catch me! Quiet down now. - Grandma, you'll never catch me! - Quiet down now, kids. - Okay, what is it? - Let's hide. It's late and you want them to stay for dinner. Am I right? Obviously because I'm a psychic. What, then? Just leave them here all alone? All right. Can no longer trust your own family. - Keep it down, kids. No more yelling. - Hurry, Grandma. There's a big monster here, and he wants to eat us! What? What was that? - Don't worry. Just sweep it up. - Okay. Bye. I'll see you later. Father... - ...you owe me a tea. - Hmm. Sure. Wow. My first paycheck, I wanna get one of these. Awesome. Gerardo never told you our work is about giving of oneself? If you don't do it for money, why do you do it, then? In order to help those in need. There's no better payment. You, ma'am? No. Sorry. Uh... Then you... Why did you join the group? Carlos was into everything pertaining to the paranormal, so he... He said that when one of us died... we'd do the same as Houdini. Houdini? Yes, he promised his wife that if the afterlife existed, he'd come back to tell her. But how? He invented a code. It would be ten words that only he and his wife knew. After Houdini died, she went to see many mediums, but nothing worked. - Yeah. - Hmm. Just goes to show you that you can't waste your whole life chasing a ghost. Well. - So, what's all this about? - Ah, yes. It's an antique store, right near here. - And this? - That's from ten years ago. The man never confessed to the crime, but the neighbor saw the whole thing. A violent death. Days ago, the owner called me, and he was very nervous. You know, noises, furniture moving by itself, the usual kind of stuff. If it's just the usual stuff, why is it so urgent? Because when I passed a pendulum over the floor plan, it just went... flying out of my hands. Civil servant, anthropologist, psychologist, and a doctorate in Paris. Bien sûr. - And you even have your own pharmacy? - Mm-hmm. A lowly civil servant must be very boring for you. Sometimes I dream of having a boring life. You're so pretty, men must be falling at your feet. You're not so bad yourself, mister. You really haven't been with anyone since your wife died? - Uh, look, I-I'm single. - You know, death is a part of life. I just said I'm single. The agency states that clearly. Sorry. I guess I'm mistaken, then. That's how I know you. I've seen you on TV. - No. - Yes, y-you're that psychic. - No. Yes, I am, but don't worry. - I've gotta go. No, listen, I'm getting out of that. I, uh... I'm going to, uh, focus only on being a pharmacist. I'm telling you. Don't go. Excuse me. I just spoke to Gloria. She's not feeling well. Right, then. Let's go. I better get home. I get off in half an hour, and... So, maybe we could get a drink or something. Me? Oh, no, no. I can't. Sure. That's fine. Uh... No problem. Change the season, or the winter in your heart will never end. The Bible? No, it's my favorite song. Uh, so then, I guess we won't be, uh, doing any ghost-hunting? It would be pretty pointless without her. TEMPLE AUCTION HOUSE Coming. I'm coming. ANTIQUE SHOP Just a minute. - Good evening. I... - Oh, hello. ...came to, uh... Oh, yes. Uh, they left a little while ago. I'll just come back another day. Thank you. They close earlier every day now, since there are no customers. And this morning, a man went running out of here, as if the police were after him. - Mm-hmm. - Poor man looked like he wet his pants. Have you lived in the caretaker's quarters long? I was very young when I came here with my husband. You know what happened here, right? - Are you referring to the murder? - Yes. Tragically, my husband was killed. Poor sweet man. And I was left alone with the girl. - You have my sympathies. - Thank you. I could actually let you in if you'd like. I have the keys. - As long as that's all right. - I'm sure it's fine. You're a priest, after all. And I see you on TV a lot. There you go, Father. When you're done, could you please leave the keys in the caretaker's slot? - No problem. Thank you. - God be with you. Argh! From the mid-1980s, Pilón had created an interdisciplinary research group to study all forms of paranormal phenomena. FATHER PILÓN IN SERIOUS CONDITION It's a rare medium, because it's a concept, uh, that combines the other two. Clairvoyance being one and the experience in time and telepathy. Four minutes for me. It's my time limit for any incorporation. If you exceed that limit, you run the very serious risk of not coming back. Precisely, because when she goes into a trance, the spirit of the deceased encompasses Gloria. But fortunately, they're always peaceful. Huh? And usually quite polite. One of the most popular cases was Vergara Palace, which even made front-page news at the time. The psychophony found there was well known throughout the country. Tell them about, uh, Vergara. That's a good example. Sorry. Could we... Could we just cut it for a minute? I want you all at home to have a good listen to this. It's a sound segment. Only three precisely. Only three precisely. Only three precisely. It isn't a normal reaction. And we verified that with every piece of equipment we have, as well as our medium, Gloria. Is it true that she was unconscious for several minutes? Let's just say that this case is complicated. And we just want to wish a very speedy recovery to Father Pilón, who, by the way, hasn't come to see us in quite a while now. And now for the weather. Looks like we are expecting some pretty heavy storm activity all across the Peninsula... Listen to them. Already got him dead and buried. They just had to bring up Vergara Palace. Hi. That's all for now. Back to you, Minerva. Thank you, Angela. How's he doing? It must have been something pretty incredible to leave him in this condition. Oh, please. He drank ten coffees a day, never slept more than three hours. I know. It's just, he looked fine yesterday. Just goes to show, you never know till it hits you. Why'd you let him go alone? Ugh! Well, at least I showed up for the meeting. Oh, so I guess I'm not allowed to be sick now. Sick? - That's right, I was. - Sick. Yeah, right. Right. I'm sure you were sick, real sick. Now I see why he skipped the protocol. All research has to be done in a team. He said he had a hunch, and he was worried about it. He was in a rush. You know how he is. But he never said he was going alone... ...at any time. - Ever. - What are you making? A blanket, to keep him warm. What is this? - Only one visitor's allowed in here. - Oh, really? Well, it seems like there's many more than that in here. And a lady who says she's going to sue you for negligence. None of these ladies are my patients, ma'am. She says she came here with a tumor the size of a potato and that you prescribed a laxative. Poor lady. - She died two days later. - Oh. Okay, everyone out, right now. - Out, all of you! - Calm down. - Can I just finish the blanket? - Take your things and leave! You have to be strong now. But why? The ball, I forgot it. Gloria. What? We need to find out what happened. TOBACCO SHOP - Where's Gerardo? - He wanted to stay with Father. Hi. How are you? Shut the window. We're gonna get soaked. What happened is not normal. Let's stay focused, all right? He's old, and the man smokes like a chimney. Let's just follow the protocol and see what we find. What protocol? When you're investigating paranormal phenomena, the first thing you do is rule out any normal phenomena. Exactly. You verify that all conditions fall under what's considered normal. The phenomena can't follow the regular laws of physics. Understand? And that's where you and all your gadgets come in. Generally, when something inexplicable occurs, it's because an entity is trapped within the interface. All right. Hang on a minute. Uh, the neuroanatomical substrata that enables consciousness... ...is the brain. A-And when it stops working, consciousness ceases, inevitably. This kid cracks me up. - This is Gerardo's report. Have a look. - Okay. - Open it. - All right. In the 16th century, there was a rectory on this land. And in 1538, it burned to the ground. There was absolutely nothing left. Then an Italian trader bought the land... Right then, he built a house that stayed in his family for centuries, and in '89, the tenant who lived in the basement bludgeoned a neighbor to death. Mother of God. If he stayed in the interface, he must have been seriously pissed off. "In the interface." - Oh, yeah. - Don't worry. Relax. Most of the time, all of these phenomena are poltergeists, caused by people who live in the house. The dead are not violent. The violent ones are the living. They may throw stuff around, but they never hurt us. Most of the time, they just do it for attention. Paz! Just remember, no matter what happens, stay calm. If you're really lucky and Gloria happens to contact one of them, it'll open your mind immediately, because I'm telling you, watching her is a real show. - That's a compliment? - You're better when you're in a trance. Hmm. All right, stop. It's here. Ouch! Dammit. It's raining cats and dogs. Jesus! Is this good? Perfect! THEATER - Do you not smoke? - No. - These young people are so boring. - Mm. All right. Let's go. Enrique? Nice to meet you. Enrique. My wife Marisa. - Hello. Nice to meet you. - Hello. - I'm Sagrario. - Ruiz de Carvajal. I know who you are. Great. Oh, Palomeque! Wow! Being a psychic must be absolutely incredible. If you don't mind, I prefer the term "medium." - Of course. "Medium." That's nice. - And this is Paz. - Ah, I don't think I know you. - You don't. I'm the one who documents and records everything. - I see. - And this is Pablo, our physicist. - Hello. - So nice to meet you. Good to meet you. You're so young-looking to be a physicist. - Aren't you? - Well, I'm still studying. - Oh, Sagrario, excuse me. Forgive me, but... - Yes? Uh, how is Priest doing? Well... badly, sadly. - Uh, he's still in the hospital. - Poor man. - What a fright that must have been. - Yes. Actually, when I saw him, I was so thrilled. You were thrilled? Yes, I'm such a big fan. Yeah, I know. It's called "alopecia areata." Yes, both his eyebrows just fell out suddenly. It's stress. I draw them on. He thinks it looks ridiculous. - Ah. - Why don't we go inside? - We can give you all the details. - All right. Come in. We're getting wet. There you go. - You have everything? - Need a hand? Hello. And what's your name, sweetheart? You look so serious, and you're so pretty. - I love these pretty pom-poms... - Susanita, go on now. - I don't want you bothering anyone. - Oh, she's no bother. Hello. Can I get you a coffee or something? Huh? - I could make you something to eat? - No, we're fine, really. No? - Thank you so much. - Thank you. The caretaker, she's very kind. This way, please. Thank you, Chimichurri. We started to hear strange noises as soon as we moved in here. It's not unusual, considering it's an antique store full of old furniture. Yes, that's exactly what I said at first. Ah. Look here. See that candelabra? One day, it lit up by itself. Pow. Yes, well, sometimes, when water is combined with air, the contact is enough to... create spontaneous combustion. Wouldn't be the first time this kinda thing's happened. During paranormal activity, the temperature drops quite a bit. You feel that? Sure. And whenever the heating is turned off, it gets cold, right? Trying to heat this place costs a fortune. Um, just so you're aware, we don't charge anything. Spirits come from a dimension where the energy vibration is much higher than ours. And when they come down here, they use a lot of energy. Thermal energy. That's why the temperature drops. - Frigid. - The cold absorbs the heat. - Right. - I've never believed in ghosts... ...but what happens here is not-not normal. We'll see. You... - Everything can be explained. Yeah? - Sure. Of course. I thought the same way you do, but, uh... Uh, would you excuse me a minute? It fell onto this here. It was already sold and ready for packing. - And the mirror remained intact. - Fascinating, no? Owners often do this kind of thing to get rid of unwanted tenants. - But this is our store. - Really? - Yeah. - Yes. It doesn't say that here. - We signed for it two months ago. - And went pretty deep into debt. Don't you worry. We'll get to the bottom of what's going on here. I haven't noticed anything. Apart from... ...a terrible odor. - He has hyperhidrosis. - Hyper what? Hyperhidrosis. Excessive and abnormal, uh, sweating. - It's a challenge to live with. - Hmm. - Why don't we do the measurements, Pablo? - Sure. - We measure the magnetic field. - I'm familiar how it works. Right, Chimichurri? I'm a big fan of Jiménez del Oso. I listen to your show every week. - I never miss it. - Mine? - Yes. - Fabulous. Now you're up to two listeners. - You and her. - Funny. Now, I'm gonna ask you for a moment of silence, please. - Uh, there. It's all set. - Gloria. All right now. This house... ...is spick and span. Maybe another time. Gloria. Gloria. - Gloria! What is going on with you? - The place is clean. - I have a dinner to get to. - A dinner. - And that's why it's clean? - What? No. Come on. Father had a feeling, and look what happened. All right, listen. Father had a stroke. Full stop. Not everything in life has a supernatural explanation. You know that. Why are you so upset? I don't understand you. Bullshit. Did you not hear what's happening in there? Seriously. Didn't you see how out-of-his-mind nervous the owner was? - And what does that tell you? - Isn't it obvious? He's creating everything in his crazy mind. Look at this! This doll appeared in thin air, out of nowhere. We found it over there, this way. In that room over there, like this. Without a body. No, no, no. I'm outta here. Hey. Father would never refuse to help. Anyone who asked for help, he'd be there for them. Do what you want. God. She can be so manipulative. Mind if I take a few samples? - Of course. Whatever you need. - Great. Thank you. - We'd never seen it before. - Right. With all the little trinkets you have here... Gloria will use her ball to tell us if anything abnormal is going on. - A ball? - Oh, that's great. - Yes, of course I will. - Good. Hmm. Gloria will now use the ball to create a border between their world and ours. - Wah. - Ready, Gloria? I must have dropped it in the van with Paz's crazy driving. Walk back and get it. It's probably lying on the floor. - I'll get the keys. - Lots of things vanish here. That's true. The accounting book, keys, the embalmed glass eye. I'll be right back. - All kinds of objects. - Indeed. I'd bet my earrings that the ball is in her handbag. I got it. I got it. - It was in my handbag. - Right. Let's continue. Quiet now. Paz. Oh. - Uh... - Was that you? Huh? No. - Um... - First things first. If anybody here makes a noise, raise your hand and say, "It was me." Gloria, I really hope this is not one of your jokes right now. No. I have a date. Do you remember what that is? It's something a person... Fuck. - It's coming from there. Yeah. - Okay. Record this, Paz. - Chimichurri? - Yes, from in here. Gloria. It's damp here. Oof! This is worse than Chimichurri's issue. - Actually, i-i-it's... - Paz. It's normal in... in older buildings like this to have leaky pipes. This... This... This wasn't like this before. What do you mean? - Maybe you just didn't notice. - No, no. Enrique took pictures before, to make sure everything was the same the next day. Paz. I don't believe it. What's the matter? NOVEMBER 21, 1998 Okay. And there is no way six people... - No, no. - ...could move this. Then, what could it be? A PSI field? Elohim? Geoecia, heloclasty, pandemonium? Or just a common kamarupa? - Marisa. - What? Calm down. There. Right there is where I found Father on the ground, sprawled out. Right there? That's no coincidence. Paz. - Just a minute, please. Just a minute. - Oh, boy. - Wow. That's amazing. - L-Let me through, please. Could you please make it stop?! - I just sold it. - That's so amazing. - That was me. - Pablo. Yes, just a sec. It's impossible. What? What? - What is it? - Look. This can't be. - It has to be wrong. - Looks like 18. A normal magnetic field in Madrid is 35. Do you suffer from migraines? Uh, yes. Now that you mention it, I have a terrible migraine. Calm down. It has to be because of an iron beam somewhere. - In the ceiling, maybe. - Or... Or... Maybe this is a door here. They come in that way. Oh. Oh, my God. This has got to be a poltergeist caused by somebody. - You think? - For the love of God. - The mind cannot move physical objects. - Oh, no? It's called "psychorragia." It's a stream of mental energy that acts on material in situations of extreme stress. And there is a lot of stress happening here. Oh, no, no, no. Don't blame me. Let me just tell you one thing. I, uh... Oh. Oh, my God. - This is not of this world. - Don't underestimate eyebrow man. Enrique? Impossible. He can't move things with his mind. He can barely even count change. When she says "a door"... ...does she mean one end of a Rosen-Einstein tunnel or a space-time channel? Paz! Hey, I'm not that ugly. My camera! Well, now I've seen it all. - Good shot. - Did you get it? Got it, but my camera might be broken. - Pablo, get Paz a chair. - God. That was quite the smack. Here, Paz. Let's see. Unbelievable. Calm down. Are you all right? Marisa? - You're all right? - Yes, it didn't touch me. Thank God. It could've seriously cut your arm. - It's okay. I'm fine. - Did you look at how fast it was? It's not like they were aiming. There are more than one? Calm down, please. Panicking is not going to help us now. Fear is nothing more than a nuisance and a waste of time. And specters are like dogs. They can smell it a mile away. - Don't say that, Paz. - Just relax. - Yeah. Sure. I'm completely relaxed. - Tell me you've got something. Here. There it is. It looks like it's been sharpened recently. But didn't you say you never got hit? I'm telling you, it barely even touched me. Oh, great. It barely even touched her. - It was only a warning. - Fine. Message received, loud and clear. Oh, come on! You can't go now. It's just starting to get interesting. - It will be worth it... - Listen, I don't feel well! Please, Marisa, take him out. Take him out for five minutes, just to get some air. Hey, I'm not that ugly. Look, look. - They were aiming. - Huh. Yeah, the-the... The energies, they were aiming. That was a powerful transmitter of energies. - You learn fast. - Uh, excuse me, guys. You didn't happen to see my ball, did you? - Unbelievable. - Um... It was in the other room, last time I saw it. Let's see. It's a rectilinear movement, uniformly accelerated and modified by gravity. You have to calculate that. Uh, can you pull back a bit? - Sure, wait, I'll do it. - Okay. - What's that? - Yours. - Batteries run out? - Grab the spares. - Are there spares? - Great, kid. Now we're gonna have to try to connect to this ancient grid. We don't need any gadgets to know something's going on in here. Something very big. Oh, fantastic. My first Ouija board. Amazing. - Can you take a picture of me? - Marisa. Come on, don't be a downer. Take my picture. - Okay, now sit down. - No, no. It's okay. I'm fine. All right, now Ouija is not a game. Do you understand? It can be dangerous for people who are... emotionally weaker. - Talking about me? - Mm-mm. Not at all. Now, sit down. Some male energy will be quite useful. No, I think I'll stand. Right over here, keeping a lookout. Yo. Male energy, huh? I got tons of that. Pablo, if you cheat, I'll be able to tell. I'd hope so. See that? That's real cute. It's a pretty blouse. What? No. - Is this safe? - It is if you know what you're doing. Gloria is a phenomenon. - Two compliments in one day? - Don't get used to it. Come on. I'm meeting someone. Take hands. - Marisa, take it easy. - Okay. Hands. The other one. Be ready. Are you here? Oh, come on. Please. A little while ago, you weren't shy at all. - Maybe you should lower your tone. Hmm? - Who are you? We're here to help you. Well, this is unreal. Enrique. Would you please stop fidgeting? Uh, sorry. Sorry. I'm Gloria. Please. You can trust me. There it is. I'm glad you're with us. Now, who are you? "Q..." "U..." "I..." "M..." - "I." - Quimi. Quimi, do you live here now? "Yes." Marisa, take your finger off. - Why? - Just do it. Paz. YES - OUIJA - NO FAREWELL Gloria, I swear, I'm not doing anything. Now. Enrique. You cannot leave the room now. Quimi, does our presence here bother you? You're bothered by... Enrique and Marisa? Quimi, do you want Enrique and Marisa to leave here? Well, you don't have to suggest that, do you? Dammit. I'm gonna miss my dinner. Relax. - I-I think the rain blew out the... - Shh! Do you see him? This is not Quimi. He's a bigger bastard. Pablo, the flashlight. - Uh, flashlight. - Come on! Where do you want us to go? - Sorry, it was me. I... - Flashlight. Calm down. - All right? - Chimichurri? Enrique? Chimichurri? Chimichurri?! Chimichurri, sweetie, you scared me. Get back. Are you Enrique? Oh, my God. Hey. Enrique. Oh. What's going on? We have to hold him down! Come on! Hurry! Careful! I-I'm trying... I can't... I can't hold him! Get him on the ground! Okay. I'm holding him. We're too damn old for this! Speak for yourself! - I'm three months younger than you. - Yeah, okay. Did you hear that, Paz? Loud and clear. Look out! Sweet baby Jesus! Enriquito. Enriquito. What have they done to you? You all right? Hey. You all right? - I think so. Are you? - I'm fine. I'm not hurt. - E-Everything okay? - Yes. You're welcome. You shall be judged. I will not. I will not. I will not. Enrique! Enrique! Are you okay? - I'm cold. - I'll warm you. Oh, Chimichurri, please! - Easy now. Easy now. - Jesus. He's in rough shape. - You okay? - Yeah, I'm good. You all right, Gloria? - Yes. - You sure? That was unreal. - Yeah. - We'll call you tomorrow. Take care, now. That was crazy. I'm like... You know, that was the first time I've seen Gloria leave someone alone on the Ouija board. - Yeah? - Sure. That's because I've never met anyone quite like him. All right, Pablo... When you were a boy, did you wanna sleep with the light on? Like most kids, I guess, no? And when you're asleep, do you feel like someone's watching you? You have to learn how to protect yourself. - Protect myself from who? - From yourself, Pablo. Because this talent you have is a real gift. But you can't let this power master you. You can't let it. You were a really big help tonight. - Thank you. - What? No, no, no. I-I can't leave now, Gloria. I have to find out how this all ends. It's going to be way too dangerous for you. Then help me. I know you can. - I need your help now... - Listen to me now. You're going to have a lot to... to unlearn. Understand? - Yes! - Right. - And that takes a lot of time. - Yeah. And that's time we really don't have. Yeah, Gloria, I can unlearn it, I swear. As long as you help me, I can do it. You can't rush this. I have to tell you, this has been the most amazing night of my life. - Oh, really? - Come on, no kidding. All right. Seriously... you guys rock. - Yeah, I think we do. - Yep. Yep. Be careful, okay? Everything hurts. What's up with you anyway? I put cameras in every room, including the hallway. - So hopefully, we'll catch something. - Hmm. - Mind if I ask what you're doing? - Please, Paz. It's only a little tiny knife, all right? Sure. You're a real rebel, you know that? - How's Sagrario? - She's not doing great. Why? Take a guess. Aw, I wouldn't worry about it. She'll get over it. You have any idea what might be going on? No. I don't have a bloody clue. She doesn't have a bloody clue. You got that on tape? I gotta admit... I'm completely lost here. What if this "Quimi" is the one who bludgeoned the neighbor to death? Impossible. He said he's here now, 1998. - That murder happened ten years ago. - Oh. All right, listen. Something just doesn't fit. - Here. - Sorry. I'm still in shock. Thank you. The music. This has nothing to do with your dead husband. God, I hate it when you read my mind. Well, that's what happens when you're friends with a witch. Good friends. - You're finished now, right? - Yeah. - Good. Let's go get a stiff drink. - Great. Anyone seen my ball? Thank you. You look like a fish out of water. Well, sorry, but I guess this just isn't my scene. No. We know going out isn't your thing. And then, there's you. You let your daughter go out for you. You really should be on salary for all the hours you spend babysitting. Well, if you had kids, you'd understand. - I don't, and I understand. - Oh, I forgot, you're a saint. - Not a witch like me. - You said it. Whoop. Oh. - So, what is your scene then? A convent? - Wow. All right, that's enough. To each his own. You two just love arguing, huh? Salud! - No, no. We have to toast to something. - To Father, then. - To Father. - All right, to Father. - Eh. No, no. You don't toast with water. - What's the big deal? It's like my father always told me, never trust anyone who only drinks water. Hey, you know something? I understand you a lot better now. - Give. - No. Oh, no, no. For God's sake. One drink a year isn't gonna kill you. - One drink a month is all right as well. - All right, fine. - A toast. - You always talk me into things. To Father. - Sagrario? - Yes? Do we know each other? Oh, you're all here. This is so exciting. You actually saved my life 20 years ago. I was a flight attendant, living in a duplex. Oh, Mr. Federico! - Federico, I remember now. - That's right! It's coming back to me. He didn't wanna go. He wanted to disinherit his daughter after she sold the apartment. - Yes, right. - Right. And you couldn't stop laughing. - "How can he disinherit her if he's dead?" - And he refused to leave. "No way. I'm not leaving until I disinherit that girl." I have no idea what you did, but it worked wonders. I live there with my son now. But he was just a baby. Well, that baby is 32 now, with two kids of his own. Jesus. Time flies. - Sure does. - It's so great to see you again. Same here. Enjoy your evening. - Yes, you too. - Thanks. All the best. That Federico was too much with that long coat and gold watch. Quite the look. We've sure gotten some winners, haven't we? That Federico was right before the Vergara Palace, right? Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Your Achilles heel. Let's just let sleeping dogs lie, all right? - Mm. - She came close to biting it that day. Um. Sarmiento! That was the SOB's name. That bastard sure had a mean streak for a priest. Yeah, I remember. He just about killed Gloria. Hmm. Yeah, well, at least he left in the end. Well, that's what they told us. No thanks to you. Would you shut up? C'est fini. Good evening, my friends. Since I'm newly divorced, I'll dedicate this song to all of you. The one damn case I screw up. One? You couldn't contact my husband either. No. Please, I'm begging you. Not today, all right? I'm exhausted. You couldn't, or maybe you wouldn't? I don't believe you. This is so unfair. We tried for years, me and you. You even took me to the car and showed me where... the two of you first met. - That's true. - Hmm. But now I know why you don't want to. Oh, so you're a psychic now? When I came to the group, my one sole purpose was so that I could contact my husband Carlos. Are you actually suggesting that I haven't contacted him because I want you to stay in the group? Who was the one who got Jiménez del Oso to talk to us and published all our cases in the press? Yeah, you're right. You're right. But don't forget, you're the only one who makes any money from what we do. This group would cease to exist if it wasn't for me. - What about me? - Guess I don't exist. No, you record everything, and that's very important. But a paranormal research group without a psychic might as well be a book-of-the-month club. I work my ass off, I'll have you know. You only think of the dead till all hours of the morning. And you only think about the living and giving them prescription medication, right? Go ahead. Ask her. - No. - She's leaving to be a pharmacist. Mm-hmm. You went through my papers? Unfortunately, I don't read minds yet. Go ahead. Ask her. Listen. They say that whatever you haven't done before you turn 50, you're never going to end up doing. Well, I've turned 50, all right? And then some. That's fine. Leave us. Go do whatever you want. Great. Hey, Gloria, sit down and finish your drink. We have to figure out what's going on. Thanks, Sagrario, but I don't need your permission to do anything. Be careful not to end up like Father. Please... let me through. She left without paying. Oh... God. It's really coming down out there. Yeah, you need a good umbrella for this rain. Ah, dammit. Can you grab this stuff? I'll be right back. Sure. Key. The hell is this? Great. Coming. Coming. Hello. I'm sorry to come by so late. - Okay. - Don't worry. We'll clean it up later. Yes, you should clean up inside too. Yes, we'll do that. My... My show is just about over, so I'm going to go. Would I be able to have a word with your daughter? - No, no. - I think this is yours, right? Yes. Now, please, just leave my daughter alone. Yes, but it's... It's about the case. We need her testimony. - To be on TV? - Yes, that's right. I'll talk to her now, and then we'll record it later. - Okay, come in. I'll get you a towel. - Great. - Thank you. - Come in, come in. - We're only recording later. - Okay. So, the living room, we decided to open up this wall here... And there's my poor sweet husband. - He looks just like Burt Reynolds. - Yes. And my daughter's room is right down the hall there. She's probably reading. She loves to read. Or at least look at the pictures of all the celebrities in her magazine. All right. It's starting again. - I'll take that. - Thanks. Susanita, this lady wants to talk to you for a little while. Hi there. It's cold, huh? And raining out. You're Susanita, right? That sure looks like a cool magazine you have. You have a lot of toys here. Which one is your favorite? The Barbie with the guitar and Lola. Is that Lola? She's very pretty. Is this one yours? Do you know who did this to your doll? I bet you like TV, huh? You know what? I might be able to get you on TV. But you have to help me first. I need you to tell me who did this to your doll. Are you afraid? I don't think it was you. No, it wasn't. Can you tell me who did it? I have a handsome boyfriend. I see. - And what's your boyfriend's name? - Quimi. Quimi. He always says hi to me, smiles, and he stops to talk to me. Did your boyfriend do this to your doll? Is he here now? I see him when he goes into his house. ALCAÑIZ THEATER - And have you ever spoken to him? - He loves me, and he's handsome. Yes, he's very handsome. You're a lucky girl. I am lucky. He helps me when they hurt me. - Quimi ever hurt you? - No, he's my boyfriend. Then who hurts you, sweetheart? Shh... Hmm. Sweetheart, you can trust me. Tell me who hurts you. Need my glasses. I really love your pajamas. Would you lend them to me sometime? That hurt? Does it hurt here? Okay if I see it? Do you have these anywhere else, sweetheart? Who did this to you, sweetheart? Oh, my goodness. Oh. Oh, my God. Do you like the rain? How about we go out in the rain? We won't tell anyone. It'll be our secret. Only you and me will know. Come on. Quietly, now. No! That's it. Give me your hand. Come on now, sweetheart. No, no, no. Don't do that. What are you doing, Susanita? I need to take my doll. Listen to me, sweetheart. We have to get out of here. Shh. It's okay. Coming. All right. - Who is it? - Hi. Is Sagrario there? - Who? - My friend. - We were together. Remember? - No, there's no one here. She said she was coming to see you. She never came. - That's strange. She, uh... - Yeah. It's just that there's a flood, and I need to clean it. I just wanted a mop to clean up all the water. Uh, uh, uh. U-Until the firemen get here. Be very quiet now. I appreciate this. I'll bring it right back. - Come in. - Thank you. Thank you. Shh... Uh, could I... Could I possibly get a glass of water? Okay, go on. Hurry! It's really coming down out there, huh? But we can't complain about that, can we? Because water is life. Uh, could I get a towel, just to dry off a bit? No. Well... Uh... I've always wanted to learn how to make tortillas like that. Uh. Could you show me how? - I'm leaving, Mom. - Shh. Adding onions is a-a good idea, assuming you like onions of course. Uh, do you use onions or something else? - I'm going, Mama. - Shh! - You're gonna die! - No! Susanita, run! No! No, no! Paz! Wake up! Think of your daughter. Nighty night. I can't leave you two alone for one minute. When we first started this project and I saw how the two of us work together, I knew I'd found the man I wanted to spend the rest of... Bye-bye, Susanita. Don't worry about the girl. She'll spend the night in a good, safe residence. And the mother? The mother... is coming down to the station to answer a few questions, but she seems completely disoriented. - Thank you. - Good night. You okay, Paz? Yeah. Never better. Thanks a lot, miss. Thank you all. Come on. - Let's go. - Ai. Let's go. Are you okay? Let's get outta here. God. I feel like I got run over by a truck. She really got you good. Yeah, well, I guess, uh... ...it's all in a day's work. Let's hope the two of you will listen to me next time. I told you right from the start there was nothing here. How about Quimi? Apparently, he's a character in her favorite TV series, and the actor playing him is doing a show at, uh, well, the theater back there. She sees him walk by her window every night. In the end, it was that poor little girl's suffering that was the key to everything. - You sure you're all right to drive, Paz? - Yeah. A little headache isn't gonna stop me from seeing my granddaughter. You're a real masochist, you know that, Paz? Yeah. Come on, phenomena. Let's go. What? I've never been so happy to see you before. That's the second time I saved your life today. Thank you. Don't get used to it. Hey, I don't wanna be a pain in the ass or anything, but that song was no coincidence. It was the same song they used in that car commercial, Sagrario. Oh, shit. My ball. - Oh, no. - You're kidding me, right? Gimme the keys. Every muscle in my body is aching. Yeah, same for my joints. I'm looking forward to getting home... ...take a Valium and go to bed. - I've never taken Valium before. - You don't need to. You're the most stable one of all of us. - And the most boring. - No. A normal, conventional life sounds pretty good to me right now. I don't know what to tell you. You don't have a cigarette, do you? - I'm all out. - No, but maybe in here. - No, you're outta luck. - Oh, God, it's cold. Maybe Gloria has some. - I don't think I have any in my pockets. - I'll check her bag. I don't believe this. No. No, no, no. - Come on. - Hang on! - What? - Looks like a fuse blew. - Gloria? - Gloria! Gloria? Look. I twisted my ankle here. Gloria! - Gloria? - What the... - What? - It's here. Gloria, this really isn't funny! Where are you? That's enough. Come on out now. For God's sakes. Gloria. Shh. Come here, Paz. Gimme a hand. I wanna move this wardrobe. Come on. Okay? - Come on. - Okay. - On three. Ready? - Yeah. - Okay, one... - One. Two, three! It's impossible. - This thing weighs a ton. - Shit. We didn't move it an inch. - This is not good for my varicose veins. - No. We can do this. - Right? - Let's try. - I'm telling you, we can. - All right, we can. - Okay. - Come on. - Yes, we can. - Okay. - On three. - Ready. - Okay, Paz, put your back into it now. - Yeah. One, two, three! - Okay. - Good job. - What is this? - Flashlight. Oh, that's disgusting. Disgusting. Ai! Ugh! - Ew. - Smells like rotten meat. Sagrario, we're definitely too old for this. Way too old. Okay. - Let's go. - Careful. Paz! - It's Gloria's jacket. - Gloria! Gloria, are you in here? - Gloria! - Gloria? Come on. You sure about this? She saved my life twice. Right. She never saved my life. Gloria? Gloria? What the hell is this place? Be careful. Gloria, what are you doing? Gloria? Huh? What's this? Huh? Gifts for your grandchildren. Don't. Don't talk about my grandchildren! You hear me?! What do you want? Why did you take the mother away? I enjoyed playing with her simple-minded daughter and hearing her scream. What do you need? The three witches I have here. I can help you. But first, you have to free my friend. Am I your friend? Of course, you idiot. Gloria, I know you can hear me. You have to get outta there. - Gloria, please. - You don't have much time. I've got all the time in the world. Oh. What is that? Those are harlots who sold their souls to the evil one. They called themselves witches, but they were nothing more than swindlers. When they passed through my hands... ...their screams drowned out the cracking sounds of their bones breaking. We've gotta wake her up, Sagrario. - It's very dangerous. - Then we've gotta do it now. All right. You grab one side, and I'll grab the other. - You ready? - Yeah. Only the three witches. Long have I waited for you. But have no fear, a fair trial awaits you. No! One small jab is enough to prove to me that there no longer remains any trace of humanity left in her body. What were you thinking leaving me all alone? - It's Father. - No, no, no. - Yes, it's him. Paz. - No, Sagrario. - You have to help us, Father. Please... - Listen to me. Look at me. - You have to help us. - Look at me. It's not Father. But I got an idea. Gloria. Gloria, listen to me. You have to find Father. You have to find him. He'll help you. Find him! Hold on, Gloria. I... I don't have... ...the strength, Father. Give me your hand. Come with me. Come. This is... The Vergara Palace. Sarmiento, the man in the antique store is the same... He used me to find you. - I'm sorry. - Gloria, you have to confront him. I can't. I can't do it. He's-He's... s-stronger than I am, Father. Of course you can do it. I-I don't wanna do this anymore, Father. Your gift is much more powerful than you think. He's just like you. You can see inside him. I know. I know I can. But I don't want to, Father. I don't want to! It's the same process, only in reverse. And what'll happen to you? Just bring him to me. Gloria, I know you can hear me. - Concentrate! - You've gotta get out, Gloria. My dear, Gloria is not your friend. No. Because she has always known where to find me. Carlos? But he can make sure that we're together forever. - Can you do that? - I can do anything. - Sagrario, he's trying to trick you. - Shh. Quiet. My fleur-de-lis, together at last. - It's him. My love. - It's not! - My love, I missed your voice. - Wait! Didn't you have a code? Get him to say the code! - I never stopped looking for you. - The code, you fucking bastard! What's the code?! Naples. Tolstoy. Seventeen. White. Mikima. - Yes, it is him. - Nineteen. No, it's not him. Don't listen! It can't be him. Sagrario, there's no way it's him! Aah! Aah! What are you... - Sagrario! - Get away from me. I can't lose him now. - Sagrario. - Leave me alone. Get off me! Get off me! Sagrario. Gloria, wake up! Gloria, wake up! Gloria, wake up! Wake up! Don't give up. You can't let him win. I'm so tired, Father. I can't. I can't help you now. Only you can do it. Father, I'm begging you, don't do this. It's up to you now. This is your time. - Trust yourself! - Gloria. I'm here, Gloria. No, Paz, no. No, Carlos, no! No, Carlos! No, please, Carlos! For the love of God, don't go. - It's not him! - Stop it! Carlos, no! Stop it! No! No, Carlos, please stay with me! Stay with me! Stay with me! Sagrario, you're all right. You're all right. Sagrario? Gloria, I beg you, wake up. Wake up! Wake up! Gloria. - I'm ready. - No, Father! No, please... No one escapes their destiny, and that includes you. I'm begging you, Father. I can't! You have to! For yourself, for them. For all the people who need you. Bring him to me! Aah! Gloria! Gloria, breathe! Breathe. Oh, breathe. Aah! Shit! Gloria! Are you alive? I'm okay. What happened? You all right? Come on. - What about... - Come on, we've gotta get up there. We need to find something strong. Really strong! Come on. Let's get her outta here. That's it. - On three, Paz. - Okay. One, two... Three! Sagrario! Sagrario! Paz! Is she breathing? Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. - Hold her up. - Okay. I got her. Come on. - Come on, Gloria. Come on. - Come on. You can do it. That's it. Yes! You're back! Come on. That's it. That's it. Come on. Get it all. Come on. - Deep breath. - Hang on. Here. Come over here. Yeah! - You got a cigarette? - Yeah. Go to sleep now. I'm with my friends, having some hot chocolate. You can go to bed now, sweetheart. Night night, sweetie. - Why is your daughter calling you so late? - Oi. And on my phone. Aw, the little one just woke up and was asking for me. - What a sweetie. - I don't know how you put up with it. - Oh, Jesus! - Aah! Oh, my God! Oh, Gerardo. You all right? Yeah. - Listen, uh... - Father. No. No. No. No, no. He said to say goodbye, Paz. You knew. What happened here? Gerardo... ...why don't we tell you over a whiskey? HISTORY OF THE INQUISITION This is the story of the priest who lived in the rectory that burned to the ground. Manuel Isidro Sarmiento. - Right. - Pour me a stiff one, please. And before they transferred him here, he lived in Vergara Palace. They relegated him to a small parish and forbade him from conducting any more witch hunts, but he continued his practice of judging women, because he was obsessed with outdoing Pierre de Lancre, who tried and ended up killing 81 women. He must've been pissed that some Frenchie beat him. In one of his clandestine trials, there was a big fire. - And he burned to death. - Yeah. So, he needed three witches to surpass this Lancre. "Only three precisely." One, two, and three. You're the fucking shit. - I haven't heard you swear. - I can't believe my ears. - Neither have I. - If it calls for it. - All right, how about a toast? - I can say it again. - Fuck, yeah. - Fucking shit! - One cup of coffee. - You're the fuckin' shit! - Shut up. - All right. - Thanks, Jesús. - Well, then... to Father. - To Father. - To Father. Mm. Well, then... suppose the group goes on now without Father? Gerardo. Can you see me in a white lab coat? Serving patients with you guys out there? No way. Hey, Jesús, did you do something with your hair? - No. - Well, it looks great. - Thank you. - No? He looks good. Yeah. He does. - Well, uh, I better get back to... - Yes. I got a lot of work, so I should... - Oh, watch it. - Careful. I gotta bring this to the back. We're here. THE HEPTA GROUP HAS BEEN INVESTIGATING ALL KINDS OF PARANORMAL PHENOMENA FOR MORE THAN THREE DECADES. IN MEMORY OF PALOMA NAVARRETE
