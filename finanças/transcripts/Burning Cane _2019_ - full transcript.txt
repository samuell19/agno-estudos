Jojo has been my best friend for the last... Thirteen years. Now, he’s scratching himself to death. The mange stretches all over his body. All below his belly, all around his legs, his ankles, all up his neck and around his snout. I did just like Mrs. Greyson said to do it: I mixed a cup of hydrogen peroxide and four cups of water. I added three tablespoons of borax on top of that. I stirred it until the borax was dissolved. I poured it on his skin and let it sit for a few hours. I repeated that two days every week for five weeks. Nothing happened. I tried the apple cider vinegar; I mixed together a cup each of the vinegar and water. I put it in a spray bottle. I combed him while I sprayed him to make sure it soaked into the rashes. After that... I brought him out into the sugar cane fields and tied him around a cane stalk to dry him in the sun. I repeated it at least three or four times. When that didn’t work, I asked Marsha and she said I should pray on it. I told her that I been praying. She said that when she was a child, she had a dog that got the mange and you got to mix half a cup of apple cider vinegar, borax, and warm water, and stir it all together in a big bucket. I used a clean sponge and I soaked it up. I scrubbed his whole body hard as I could until the poor baby started crying. Then, I tied him up to the cane stalk and let him dry. I did that for a few weeks but, Jojo started scratching with more vigor than before. I tried the sulfur soap and I wetted his fur then I rubbed sulfur soap around him until he got real foamy and I let it sit for 30 minutes to give the mites enough time to move up to the top of his skin. Then, I washed him off and tied him to the cane stalk to dry. I tried that for one month. And after that he didn’t even try to get up, or... except to eat and scratch and shit. Ernest Walker told me that vegetable oil would do the trick. He said that you kill 'em by cutting off their air supply and I soaked a clean sponge in a bowl of vegetable oil. Then I ran the oil over the dog’s fur. And I did that twice every day for a month... but nothing. Olivia Newton said her mother used honey for their dog. She told me to get honey from the local harvest and put it all over the rashes. The honey was the worst. I brought him inside and tied him to the door handle because if I had let him stay outside he would’ve gotten bitten up by the ants. I cut up lemons. I cut up a lemon into small pieces and put it into water. I boiled the water and after it was at a steady boil, I turned the stove off and let it sit overnight. In the morning, I scrubbed it all over him and... nothing. You’d have to kill me before I take Jojo to a doctor. They’d just tell me to take him ‘round to the sugarcane fields and shoot him between the eyes. Who do they think they are? They have no right to tell me when Jojo needs to die. Only the Lord can do that. ♪ Swing low, sweet chariot ♪ ♪ Coming forth to carry me home ♪ Yes, Lord. ♪ Swing low, sweet chariot ♪ ♪ Coming forth to carry me home ♪ ♪ Well, I looked over yonder and what did I see ♪ ♪ Coming forth to carry me home ♪ ♪ A band of angels watching over me ♪ ♪ Coming forth to carry me home ♪ ♪ Swing low, sweet chariot ♪ ♪ Coming forth to carry me home ♪ ♪ Swing low, sweet chariot ♪ ♪ Coming forth to carry me home ♪ Yes!

Some people try to accumulate possessions. They are constantly trying to get more, and more, and better stuff. It is attributed to the late Malcolm Forbes. He said, you know, "he who dies with the most toys wins," right? "He who dies with the most toys wins." Now, however, since he has died, he has learned that is not to be true. That’s not true. "He who dies with the most toys wins." You can go out there and try to get a pretty dress, but it don’t mean nothin’ if you gone lose your soul. "He who dies with the most toys wins." He knows that not to be true. Because when he died, he better have good relationships because that didn’t get him across Jordan into Heaven. No toys get you into Heaven. It’s the friendships that you have, it’s the kindness that you do. Did you clothe me when I was naked? Did you give me housing when I had no place to live? Did you feed me when I was hungry? Did you drink-- give me water to drink, when I was thirsty? "He who dies with the most toys wins." What good is it for a man to gain the whole world but lose his soul? Malcolm Forbes, I hope you did better than that in life and you are in a better place but, he who wins with the more toys is not what we believe. We believe in a higher calling. Someone who means more to us than just things and possessions. Now, that’s a good God. A God who loves you. Loves you more than anybody you ever thought of loving, loves you more than you can imagine. A deep love that is deeper than your own mind could understand. That’s what we believe, church, brothers and sisters. We’re not looking for toys, it’s not a plaything. This is our life. Our eternal life. And for that, we must invest in love. Love for your neighbor, love for your family, love for your children. Love for your wife and your husband. That’s what we believe in. And the greatest love of all is the love of our God almighty. Praise Jesus. However... there are those who die like Mr. Forbes and forget, and think that possessions and the accumulation of possessions are the things that truly mean something. But they never mean anything. You will never truly be happy and fulfilled if you’re trying to hold onto possessions! They mean nothing. But on the other hand, if you focus on what is really important: building relationships with your mother, and your father, and your children, and your good friends. But most important, that relationship we have with God. He’s the one we must always keep in the forefront of our minds. That’s the most important relationship you’ll ever have in your life. First half of Proverbs eight... The first half of Proverbs 18:24, says, "A man who has friends must himself be deserving." A man who has friends must himself be deserving. So, church... Are you deserving? Do you have friends? Have you taken the time to build the relationships of love that are the most important things in this life. Martin fought in the war. I can’t compete with that. And daddy... he worked hard everyday. Worked himself to death. That’s what killed him. AIDS killed your daddy. Why you looking at me like that? You know your daddy was a hoe. I’m worried about Jojo. He’s a sweet dog but... You ain't tried to treat him? They say the motor oil will cure those rashes right on up. I done everything that I could. Come on now, drink some more. Go to sleep, now. Put him to sleep a few hours ago. Is there something to eat? You didn't eat while you were out? I was working. What's wrong? Nothing. Well, obviously, there’s something bothering you. I said, "nothing." Period. No? I’m starting to question your taste in music. Yeah?

In the 40 years since Pastor’s been preaching, I’d never seen that chair empty before that Sunday. So after service, I went over to congratulate him on a wonderful sermon, and I asked him about Johnnie-Mae. He said she was at home sick. And I would’ve left it at that but... he was sweating and... he wouldn’t look me in the eyes. I asked him if something was wrong and he yelled, "Helen, I already told you where she is now mind your fucking business!" Everyone leaving the sanctuary turned around. Then he pulled me in his office and closed the door. And he sat on the floor. He said that Johnnie-Mae just wouldn't stop. She kept calling him names and she was goin’ on and on about how unhappy she was and how she didn’t trust him and that she wanted a divorce. Pastor said that’s when things got blurry. He said the next morning, he came down the stairs and there she was, mopping up her own blood. She tried to tell him good morning... but she couldn't. Practically every false doctrine, comes from getting things out of order. God’s divine order is salvation then change, not change then salvation. If one has to be changed to be saved... that’s how salvation works. There’s also salvation by the flesh. The truth is, one is cleansed from his sins by yielding to the Holy Spirit. Letting him do his work. Man is the same today that he has always been, he is a rebel against God. He may, in some generations, hide his rebellion a little more carefully than other times. But there is no change in his heart. The men who built the city against God, back in the days of Babylon... had the same hatred in their hearts... as that which possessed the men who nailed the Lord Jesus Christ... to the cross. Jeremiah! Come on, now.

I call it like I see it. On Johnnie-Mae's grave, this church is dying off and ain't nothin' we can do about it. What is this foolishness that you’re talking about, Pastor? I realized... something that was concerning me, very concerning when I was with a very dear, very young friend of mine... These young people don't believe a goddamn word I'm preaching up there on that stage and I know it. And if we... are being truthful to ourselves, deep down we all know it too. Yeah, I don't blame the children. I blame y'all. For telling them they can wear dresses when they got a penis between their legs. I blame y'all for telling them they could do whatever they want to do. When it's God who tells us what we gonna do. Ain't nothin' we can do about it. - Hey! - Hey, hey! How you doing there, babygirl? What can I do for you? Where you going? I'm going to the Piggly Wiggly... grocery store. Yeah, I... That's one of the things I got to do now that Johnnie-Mae's gone. I got to tell you, y'all don't get enough credit for this shit. Well look, umm, I'd be happy to show you around. Why thank you very kindly, Helen. Alright, so move on over. Uh-uh. - What, you don't trust me... - Oh, Pastor... with my liquor? You don't think I can hold my liquor? Helen, don't play dumb with me. I know damn well what you doin'. I also know that, I don't care how drunk I get... the good Lord is looking out for me. Amen? And he's gonna see that I get to the store and home. You'll see, babygirl. Listen, I'll give you a call when I make it home. I'll prove it to you. You gonna be home by five, Helen? I don't know. Well... say a prayer for me. Now, back on up. Come on Pastor, why don’t you let me-- Back on up on. Come on, back on up now. - Come on. - Come on, you come on. Back on up, you’re gonna get your foot caught under one of these tires, back up now. Move out my way, I’m not gonna ask you more than once, Helen. If you lose a foot, don't say I didn't warn you. - Come on, Pastor-- - Back up now! The body was found with visible trauma to the head, neck, breast, ribcage and spine. The genital area showed signs of forced entry. The Coroner’s office has released - strangulation.

Didn’t Sherry tell you I was planning on calling y'all? I made that very clear. We-- we’ve been busy... working. I’ve been trying to get ahold of you since Sunday, boy. I apologize. So how’s work been? You been working hard? Yes ma’am. I’m off this weekend. I think they’re finally starting to appreciate the work that I've been putting in. Might even be up for a promotion. I called your job, Daniel. You lost your job. You went to work drunk and started a fight. I said, "Oh no sir, not a son of mine." They said you were lucky that boy didn’t press charges. Have you lost your mind? You got Marsha’s daughter taking care of you- I can explain. No son of mine gonna lose his job and let some girl take care of him. You’re just like your pa, lying through your fucking teeth! You are a failure, as a son, as a man, and as a father! Ma, I promise you, they been out to get me since day one. I swear to God! You always got some fucking excuse. How’s my grandson? Where is he? He’s great. You wanna talk to him? No. Get his things ready, and you can explain that to your wife! Ma, what are you talking about? How’d it go today? Fine. Mama came to pick up Jeremiah. No stories about Wanda and her bitchin' and complainin'? No. Sure ain’t been none in a while. I talked to Pastor again. What’d I tell you 'bout that? Them people in town don’t nothing but talk. Tillamn ain't no different. He’s a good man, Daniel. He wants nothing but the best for us. Aint no deacon job worth the investment of buying a car just for me to be going down there everyday. It ain't worth buying another car... It's not everyday! Just to be driving down there or for you to be taking me down there. We can’t afford that! How would you know? Daniel, if you think I’m asking you to get a job just to get a rise out of you, you’re more selfish than I thought. Daniel, did you hear me? Daniel, are you fucking deaf? When you had time to get drunk? It is such a blessing to have Jeremiah in Laurel Valley. I wish Marsha would let me keep him over here, but she said she wants him under her "watchful eyes." The same watchful eyes that crashed a Packard into a tree. She’s worried that if I watch him, I’m just gonna let him do whatever he wants, and he’s gonna lose himself in the woods or drown in the swamp. I don’t know what happened to that boy. Marsha and I have been helping out until he finds a job. I would tell him, "Daniel, it’s hard to dance with the Devil on your back." Every time you try to move your feet, nails as sharp as a cleaver cut deep into your flesh. When you’ve got the Devil on your back, you oughta just stay still, let him do as he pleases. 'Cause once he’s done, find a cleaver for your throat, because the Lord has seen your treason. You look good. You seen my limp? Yeah I seen it. I went to Mr. Mark’s store and I was reaching for something, I don’t remember what it was, but it was something high. And next thing I know, my knee done gave out on me and I’m on the floor. Ooh! Lord the pain went through my left side, I didn’t think I was gonna be able to get up. I swear, I laid there for five minutes before anybody who saw me asked me if I was alright. Lord have mercy, people today, I tell ya. It was Mr. Mark’s son, Todd, who helped me to get up, and by the grace of God, I could walk away. I was scared I was gonna have to be in a wheelchair. But you know, with the help of the Lord, I’ll be fine and I’ll survive. Well that’s great, Ma. I’m glad to see that you’re doing okay. Eat. Father, thank you for this which we are about to receive, to nourish our bodies, in Christ’s sake. Amen Daniel, come on down here and help me cook. Daniel! Daniel? Daniel, didn’t you hear me talkin' to you? Boy, why you ain't answerin' me? I'm not feelin' too well, Ma. I think I got the pneumonia. What would make you think that? I got the chills. I got a sharp pain underneath my left rib. It’s sorta hard to breathe. Lemme see. The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? The Lord is my life’s refuge; of whom should I be afraid? When evildoers come at me to devour my flesh, my foes and my enemies themselves, stumble and fall. Though an army encamp against me, my heart will not fear. Though war be waged upon me, even then will I trust. One thing I ask of the Lord, this I seek: To dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, that I may gaze on the loveliness of the Lord and contemplate his temple. Amen. So you been talkin' to the Pastor about that? Just need a little more time. I’m gonna be workin' by the end of the month. You said that last month. That church could be a blessing for us. All my life, Pastor’s been nothing but good to me. To us. Tell your Pastor I don’t need his help. Why don't you tell him? Answer my question. Answer my fucking question. Answer me when I'm talking to you-- You're a child! Are you gonna clean that mess up? If you think I’m gonna pick that up, you’re crazy! Our Father which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on Earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespassed against us. But lead us not into temptation! But deliver us... Deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory. Forever!

What would you do if I told you, that uh, there is someone so perverted, so sick, so disgusting, so vindictive, so vile, So obsessed with our children that he would do anything in his power... - Daniel. - ...to destroy their innocence, Ruin their lives... Daniel! - Rob them of the word of God, - Wake up, boy! Wake up! And murder them, yes murder them. Take their life, not only physically but spiritually too. This is a person that’s not found on some bulletin board at the post office, no. You ain’t gonna hear the police put out a APB on him. Registered with child protective services, oh no, none of that. However, he is registered in the Bible. Yes, in first Peter, chapter five, verse eight, they say he is our adversary. "He is a roaring lion..." Help me! Get up! "That walks amongst us, seeking whom he may devour." His attacks are so heinous, so insidious, so malicious, so meticulously calculated that often we don’t know that he done already come up on us, without us even being aware. Captured our children! And taken they life away, right before our very eyes. Talk to 'em! He wants to keep you away from God’s message. He wants to keep you, and our children, away from God’s promise. Preach, Pastor, preach! He wants to keep you from the living life and light of the Lord. Preach, pastor! He wants to keep you away from God’s promises. And he will use anything in his power, every trick in the book, to keep you... Yes! Away from God! Preach, pastor! He is cunning, crafty, calculated, convincing, devastating, rude, mean, ruthless evil! And he’s coming for you! He is the fallen one. The father of all lies. The father of deception! And he wants you and our precious, little children. These babies. These children of God. He will use your family, your friends, your neighbors, anybody to turn you to his side. And make you go away from the light of God. Why did Adam and Eve eat the forbidden fruit? When they knew better! They knew the gift God had given them but they turned away and ate the forbidden fruit. Why? Because they were corrupted. They were corrupted by this evil one. The one, whose name I shall not speak... but you know who he is. You know that they were lied to! They were lied to by the most convincing liar who ever walked the face of this Earth. And oh yes church, he walked the face of this Earth. He’s still walking the face of this Earth! He’s walking around us today; out in the street, out on the corner. Wherever you go, he’s right behind you! And you gotta say "Devil!" Devil! Right to his face! Find out where the snakes are in the grass. You say to Him, "Devil", you need to be able to do this. Can’t be afraid, get up in there! In his face. And say, "Devil, you nor anyone else will ever pull me away from the power of the Lord." No one can do that, pull me away from the power of the Lord! You gotta say "Devil!" Repeat after me, "Devil!" Devil! - Devil! - Devil! I will not be corrupted. I will not be corrupted. - Devil! - Devil! I will not cheat. I will not cheat. - Devil! - Devil! I will not lie. I will not lie. Devil! Devil! What ever you do, What ever you do, no matter how hard you try, ...no matter how hard you try, - ...you will never... - ...you will never... - you will never... - ...you will never... - pull me away... - ...pull me away... from the kingdom of the Lord! From the kingdom of the Lord! From the kingdom of the Lord! From God’s power! From the only one who can save my soul! Save my heart! Make my life have some purpose! - Amen? - Amen! - Amen. - Amen. Thank you, church. Have you heard from Sherry? I called her job; they haven’t heard from her. I haven’t talked to her. Nothing? No. Can you do me a favor? Can you ask Daniel if he’s heard from her? I’ll ask Daniel to reach out. Oh, uh-uh. You ain't smokin' no Marlboro’s in my house. This house, we smoke Winston’s. You remember that ad they used to have? No ma’am, I can’t say that I do. Oh, you remember it. Oh, wait. Now, it mighta’ been before you was born. No, no you was born. Remember it used to come on The Flintstones and they used to sing, ♪ "Winston’s taste good like a cigarette should!" ♪ You remember that? Boy, I believed ‘em. When they tell ya you're smoking the best cigarettes, you better believe ‘em! I still believe ‘em today. Can I have one? I thought you was a Marlboro man. When the last time you heard from Sherry? I think she’s still going to work. That’s about all I know, Ma. I find that mighty strange. ‘Cause that girl would cut off her arm for you and Jeremiah. Are you tryna' drown yourself in liquor? No, ma'am. Whatcha sad about? You depressed? I don’t think I get depressed. I do get sad sometimes, though. Well, something terrible musta' happened. Daniel... do you think I'm simple? Ma’am? It's an easy question, Daniel. Do you think I’m simple? Mama, I don’t know whatchu gettin’ at. So, now you gonna act simple. Do you think I’m simple? Sherry had no respect for me. Everyday she asked me if I was checking the newspapers, sending out applications. She saw the stacks of papers under my bed. Yet she still asked the question. She told me every time she go down to the Piggly Wiggly with Jeremiah, the manager come over and talk to ‘em. She even told me to take Jeremiah down there with me next time so I can get a interview. She said having a child with me might add a little sympathy. Every time I tried to tell her about all the work that I was putting in around the house, she wanted to act dumb. She wouldn't even look at me, Ma. Sooner or later, she was gonna be bringing another man into my house and Jeremiah was gonna hate me. You have to understand that. She deserved it. What am I gone do? What am I gone do, Pastor? What am I gonna do? This is something you have to keep inside the family. That's right. You're gonna have to deal with this privately. No outside influences. Just you and God. I know just the verse that’ll guide you; it's Ephesians six, verses 10-18. "Finally be strong... in the Lord. And in his mighty power, put on the full armor of God so that you can take your stand against the Devil’s schemes. For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but... against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms." So, therefore, put on the full armor of God. When the day of evil comes, take up the stand of faith. With which, you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of evil. Take the helmet of salvation and stand... with the sword of the spirit, which is the might of God, and perform... as God might. ♪ Coming for to carry me home ♪ ♪ Swing low, sweet chariot ♪ ♪ Coming for to carry me home ♪ ♪ Swing low, sweet chariot ♪ ♪ Coming for to carry me home ♪ ♪ I looked over yonder ♪ ♪ And what did I see ♪ ♪ Coming for to carry me home ♪ ♪ A band of angels coming after me ♪ ♪ Coming for to carry me home ♪ ♪♪
