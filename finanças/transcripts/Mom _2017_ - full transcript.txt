I haven't done anything, man! Ma'am has come... 'Get your girlfriends along...' Good morning, guys. - Good morning, ma'am. Good morning. Early morning...1st lecture. And that too biology... Sad, no? - Yes, ma'am. But... it's important to study. But waking up at 6 o'clock in the morning... Should be of some use... Isn't it? By the way, did you catch the Sci-fi film 'Space Bound'? Yes, ma'am. What a movie! Is it good? Have you seen it. - I think I've seen the trailer. Why don't you go with him? - Why should I? Blushing and all, huh! Nice movie. Well, today we'll study the different muscle groups in the Human Body. There are 639 muscles in the Human Body... ...and each has a unique function. Let's start with this portion here. 'Rectus Abdominus'. Also known as... Popularly known as the six-packs. Mind blowing... - Hello, guys. This is still a biology class. Concentrate. The function of the 'Rectus Abdominus' is... ...flexing at the abdomen. It runs vertically across the stomach... ...and is separated from the skin by a layer of fat and water. You're a pervert! This is called the Transverse abdominus. - What happened, Arya? Look, what he has sent. - And these here are the oblique's. Yuck! - They are... What's going on there? Nothing, ma'am. What happened here? Nothing, ma'am. You both leave the class now. Ma'am...it's not our fault. Look what Mohit sent to Arya. Everyone knows 'No phones inside the class'. Give me your phone. I am sorry, ma'am. Your phone! I won't do it again, promise, last chance. I won't repeat myself. Tell your parents to come see me. Now back to class. Is my black suit back from the cleaners? Yes, it's in the closet. Sis is coming. - Okay, sit down. Madam... what's in your hand, madam? It's nothing, madam. It's definitely something, madam. Chocolate. Your sister gave it to you, didn't she? How did you know, mom? Mom has 10 eyes... She can see everything. Even I can't hide anything from her. Show me your 10 eyes. Show me. Show me. - No...it's a secret. I can't tell you. Come child. How was your day? - Ask her. Cottage-cheese... - It's alright, I'll help myself. Anand, the kids holidays are approaching. Let's decide where to go. We'll need time for tickets and hotel bookings. Last minute everything becomes very expensive. Dad, can I suggest where we should go? - Where? See... - Wow! Beautiful. See... It's really nice. Where is this? - Show me. Close to Kufri. - Wow. Fine...let's plan once I am back. Devki, please handle the bookings, etc. Sure. - I've figured out everything, dad. I'll tell you everything when you're back. How long will you be gone, dad? - 10 days. What do you want from New York? Eiffel Tower. The Eiffel Tower is in Paris. Then go to Paris instead, why are you going to New York. By the way, dad, you're looking quite handsome today. What do you want? Don't you know how to take a compliment? The last time I looked handsome... ...I had to buy her a mobile phone worth 40,000. So, what do you want? There's a party on Saturday night. All my friends are going. Do you know about this? Saturday is Valentine's Day, right? - So? No...nothing. Where's the party? Can I go, papa? But where's the party? Zodiac Farms, it's not too far from here. No, that's too far. It is very far. Who else is going? - Like I said...all my friends. Is Sapna going? - Hmm. And Rishi? - Hmm. Any more questions, ma'am? Arya. - What? I am asking for your permission. Fine, we'll think about it. What's there to think? Don't you trust me? Of course dear, we trust you. - Then? Do you need mam's approval for this too? Arya, behave yourself! Arya. Arya. It's no ordinary event. It's the hottest party in Delhi. Kabir's coming as well. You should propose to him. - Have you lost your mind? I mean... Catch you later. - Bye. Dinner. I spoke to your dad. He's agreed. You can go to the party. What are you going to wear? Never vent your anger on food. Finish your dinner. Goodnight, dear. I don't feel like leaving you guys and going. What do you think? Arya was right. You're really looking handsome nowadays. Really? What is it that you want? - I see... Just finish your conference and come back soon. I know...you always handle everything. But...I'll try talking to Arya again. She just can't share you with anyone. Actually, it's we who need to understand her. Rajender, Look after the house. Yes, sir. - Dad. What's the matter? You didn't Whatsapp your shopping list yet. Don't you want anything? Dad... I am sorry for last night. I know I hurt you and ma'am. When will you stop calling her that? She's your mother. You've forgotten my mother,... ...but not me. What I did for us was right. I could've never raised you without Devki. She has accepted us. She never differentiated between you and Priya. I have accepted Piyu. It's always the mother who's blessed with a daughter. And not the other way around. I can't do it, dad. I can't let her down. I miss her. I really miss her. - My child... Go enjoy your party. Papa. Mr. Anand. - Yeah. What good is your laptop without this? Oh my, God... Where's my passport? Your passport and tickets are in the right zip. Right zip. What will I do without you? Okay, bye. - Bye. Bye. - Bye. Come soon. - I will. Bye. - Bye. Bye. Mina, see who's at the door. - Yes. Is Devki madam at home? We're her students. Ma'am, your students are here. Fine, I'll be right there. Hello, madam. Niranjana, what brings you here? Hello, madam. - Hello. Come in. Sit. Sit, Rohini. We just started a new business... Tie and Dye. And to share this joy please accept these sweets from our side. This is amazing... very good. None of this was possible without you. You educated us... Gave us respect. And as a result, we're independent now. No-no...it's all because of your hard work. Is that your elder daughter you always talk about? Yes. - I see... How about some tea or juice? - No need for formalities. We'll be leaving now. See you on Thursday, keep your assignments ready. - Yes. Dear. Sweets? What do you talk to them about me? Nothing. Just generally... Nice things only. I've no objection to your social service. But you don't have to talk to anyone about me. Didn't you tell them? What? That I am not your daughter, ma'am. Sweets. Hey... What are you doing, Piyu? Stop...stop...stop. Hurry up now, it's too late. Just one more line to go. Sweet kid. Hi, Kabir. Don't be too late, please. Yes, ma'am... don't worry. And Rishi, I hope your driver's... Arya... You're looking so pretty. Thanks. Isn't it, Piyu? Dear... - Yes. Wow. - Arya, is your phone charged? Yes. Take care. Have fun. Bro. Bro? - Yeah. Remember I told you about this girl I like. Whose mother broke your phone? Yes, her. That's her, in red. So why are you wasting your time here? Should I go? - Go. My bag. Come on. Let's dance. "It's my life." "I'll live it the way I like." "I'll live it the way I like." You're looking hot. How about a dance? Excuse me, she's not interested in you. Don't you get it? Please leave. - It's just one dance. But she's not interested. Come on, it's Valentine's Day... - Get lost you sicko. "It's my life." "It's my life." Hello... Yeah, dad I'm heading to the airport... coming. I'm leaving now. Sh** it's dad again, I've to go. But I'll be back. - Okay... Okay bye. Did you get the stuff? - The best. Full power. 24 hour. What's wrong, Bunty, huh? Doesn't she know it's Valentine's Day? Why is she acting so pricey? Do you want her? Bunty, do you want her? - What can you do? Watch and learn from the best. Hi. - Hi. Charles Deewan. - Arya. I like what you're wearing. - Thank you. Would you like to have a drink with me? No, thanks. Your Boyfriend? None of your business. I don't mind. - Hey, wait... How much more are you going to drink? I am single. Sorry, I am Sapna. Do I look like a waiter to you? "Watch and learn from the best." "The best..." Shut up! Try being polite with them, and... Why don't you tell him? - What? That you like him? - Are you mad? Here... Just go...go... - Red rose! Go I am telling you. "Crow caws on the rooftop." Let's go home. Come on. Forget him. What's wrong? - I feel dizzy. Let Rishi come. Stay here, I'll call a cab. "On the rooftop..." Yes, ma'am. Hold on. Yeah. I'll be home in 40-45 minutes. What? Yeah, okay. Taxi. You... Wait.. You... Hold her! Hold her! - She's kicking. Hurry up - Hold her legs! Hold her legs! Who is he? - He's a friend. Drive. Hold her legs - Tie her hands - Now call your mom! - Now call your mom! Shut her mouth. Call your mother! Indu...Arya hasn't come home yet. Indu. - Sister, Did Arya come home? Not yet. Stay with Piyu, I'll go get her. - Okay. And keep trying Arya's number. - Okay. Keep trying. "I scare away one, two, a plenty few." "My beloved is to meet me at midnight, my heart races." "I scare away one, two, a plenty few." "My beloved is to meet me at midnight, my heart races." "The guard's stick hurts, it hurts badly." "The guard's stick hurts, it hurts badly." "Run for your life, if you get caught, plead for your life." Where is Arya? - What, Ma'am? Where is Arya? - Don't know. She was here a while ago. I can't reach her. It's been two hours since she left for home... Wasn't she with Sapna and Rishi? Yes, ma'am. - Rishi, has no clue. He doesn't know anything. Come on let's dance. - And, Sapna, she doesn't know anything. I am really sorry, ma'am. - We don't know. Sorry, ma'am. I told Rishi to take care of her. Sir... Sir...sir...I need your help. - Yes. My daughter hasn't reached home yet. Please help me. I am tensed... - Get a glass of water for the lady. My daughter was attending a party at the farmhouse... I'm trying her phone... What's the name of your daughter... ...and which farmhouse did she go to? Arya Sabarwal. Zodiac Farm. Yeah... what's the problem? Her daughter's disappeared. She hasn't disappeared... She just hasn't returned home yet. Take a seat, ma'am. - Sir, I am very worried. I've been trying to call her... ...but it's unavailable. - Please. Sit down and tell us everything. What's the age of your daughter? - 18 years. Give us her phone number. Sure? Get to work and trace this phone number. Sir. Please try. - Have some water. You shouldn't be worried. It's Valentine's Day. She must be out with her boyfriend. There's no way she'll tell you. What are you saying? Ma'am, kids these days are just like that. Don't worry... She must be enjoying herself somewhere. We deal with such cases every day. - Sir, please. You might have dealt with similar cases before. But my daughter isn't like any of them. She called me at 12:30 and said she's coming home in 45 minutes. That clearly means she was coming home! Look at the time now. It's been 3 hours. She isn't at her friend's place... ...nor at the party, nor is she answering her phone. In fact, no one knows where she is. Do you get what I am saying? I need your help. Write down your details in this register. And your phone number. As well as the description of your daughter. Give me your number, I'll send you her photograph. Okay. We'll inform you as soon as we can. You can go home. Hello Indu, just keep trying. Hello, madam. I'll call you back, bye. My name is Dayashankar Kapoor... ...but, you can call me DK in short. I am a detective. Private-eye. Don't mind the Police. Dealing with crime every day, they have become thick skinned. Let me know If I can be of any use to you. No need to hesitate. No thank you. - How sweet of you. Here's my card. Keep this. It's my official card. I've quite a reputation in Old Delhi. I am a licensed detective, yeah. By the grace of God just from the ashes of a man... ...I can deduce his entire life. You're welcome to try. Best gadget... Best surveillance. Hi-tech equipment. I've everything, I guarantee. - Sir, I need to get home,... ...please move. - No, problem, ma'am. Have faith in the Almighty. Your daughter will come home. Everything will be fine. Your dress. This way, ma'am. Excuse me... - Ma'am. Mrs. Sabarwal. - Yes. Come with me. This side.. Oh, God! Arya. Oh, God! How did this happen? Arya. She's had severe internal injuries. She is still in a state of shock. And...we might have to do multiple surgeries later on. Because of internal bleeding.. ... she is unable to eat. So we will be feeding her through her IV. In fact...somebody tried to strangle her to death. Because of which her breathing is inconsistent. If she doesn't stabilize soon... her condition can get critical. To be honest with you, ma'am... ...your daughter has been physically abused. It's possible that your daughter has been raped. Ma'am... She's a strong girl, ma'am. Behind me is the very hospital... ...where the assault victim was admitted a while ago. Sources confirm that she is in critical condition. We'll update you as soon as we've more information. This is Pankaj Sharma with cameraman Sahil, Zee News, Delhi. Sir, boss is calling you. What's the update on Sansar Singh's case? Charge sheet's been already filed, sir. The victim at JP Care Hospital is no longer an assault case. It's rape. Possibly gang-rape. Go and take over. - Yes, sir. Mrs. Sabarwal. Ma'am, please sign here. Thank you, ma'am. Mrs. Sabarwal. Matthew Francis, Crime Branch. I'm...extremely sorry about what has happened. I want you to know that... ...we've started our investigations. We're interrogating everyone present at the party. Also...we must record your daughter's statement... ...whenever she regains consciousness. I'm sure you understand. Anand...please come back. We really need you. Please come back. Please! Arya. Dear... What do you want, dear? Water? Would you like some water? Bed... - Bedpan. You want the bedpan? Hold on...I'll get it. Please, dear. Just one spoon. I am sorry.. Did she say anything? Tell us something, dear. Who were they? We know... ...how hard this is for you. But only you... can bring them to justice. If you can... - Do you know... Do you know what he was screaming? "Now call your mom" I don't remember anything after that. Sir... The girl has given her statement. Get up. Leave my collar - Come. What have I done? - Let go. Bro. - Come quietly. - Leave me. Where you are taking me? Come on, You... - Let go. What have I done? Where you are taking me? Leave my collar. You will pay for this, inspector. You will... Sir, let me go. - Sir, where you are taking him? I haven't done anything. - Where are you taking him? Sir... - Sir... Sir... Stop hitting him. Sir... I haven't done anything. I haven't done anything. - What has he done? Let me go. - Sir, let him go. We know he's your friend. Say it clearly. - His name is Jagan Singh. Don't die before I return. Where are you taking my son? - I'll be back soon. Get up... Where are you taking me? - Come on. Open the door. - Take care, Uncle. I'll be back soon. Get in. I said get in. I could've done that myself, Tara. Then you should've done it by now. - Okay... Can I get a cup of tea? The weather's playing tricks again. No tea for you! I'll get it. What is English for 'Tara'. - Star. She's got starry tantrums. 'The Valentine Day rape case...' Go back... ...post the victim's statement. This is the gang-rape incident case, where the victim was... Kidnapped from Zodiac Farms... No one's safe in this country anymore. She was found next morning in critical condition in a drain. The victim has identified four people through video conferencing. - Tea. The case is now under Crime Branch... ...which is being lead by Officer Matthew Francis. Nothing's ever going to change in this country. Why not, mom? The government will have to take an action for this. The people need to wake up. Listen...you must come home early from your tuitions. Mom? - Don't you see what's happening? What are you saying? - What am I saying? Why don't you say something? It always has to be me. - All four are still in custody. The case has been forwarded to Fast Track Court... ...and the victim has sought permission to depose through video conference. "...And when they thought I am dead, they..." "...threw me.... ...out of their car." Sir, we seek permission for their forensic test. Granted. Thank you, sir. Arya's injuries are consistent with her story. I am completely sure she's telling the truth. And the rest can be proved... ...after we receive the forensic report. Everyone says that we'll lose this case... ...as soon as the forensic reports arrive. Please do something. This is Arya Sabarwal's blood report... ...on the 14th of February. Blood alcohol content is 0.08. Her statement is not reliable. I am at the court. I'll call you back. Sir, this is the victim's phone. The police recovered it from the exact same location... ...where she claimed she was kidnapped. 'Sit here, I'll call a cab.' Sir, I was at that party from 10 pm to 4 am. Charles and Mohit were with me. They never left. In fact, she left the party. These are their phone records. The triangulated positions show... ...that Charles was at the party. And Baburam never left his post. And Mohit's teacher broke his phone. So... The traffic signal cameras... - Sir, verification. It's verified. - Thank you, sir. Sir, we've recovered footages of the car... ...between the farmhouse and the drain. It's Charles Deewan's car, which the victim mentioned in her statement. Sir...the car was completely washed. No prints, no fluids. You two go back to the party. And you, back to your post. I'll go wash the car. - Okay. I was driving the car. I borrowed the car from dude... I mean, from my friend Charles.... ...since it was Valentines Day... ...and I wanted to take my girlfriend for a ride. Sir, his phone's location proves that he was in the car. With his girlfriend, of course. I called the police immediately after I found her. But I thought it was better to take her to the nearest hospital... ...instead of waiting for the police. Note down...victim was found where she claims she was thrown. Before I left, Mohit was misbehaving with Arya. By the time I got back, Sapna was quite dizzy... ...and Arya's phone was unreachable. After that, I dropped Sapna home. And finally, Baburam has confessed to the police... Objection. Inadmissible. Sustained. Don't waste my time. Don't you think your friend Arya left with her boyfriend? They had sex. They had an argument... He beat her up. - Objection! Character assassination. But unfortunately in our society... ...we cannot openly admit to affairs. - Objection, sir. So she blamed it on someone else. - Sustained. Stop this rubbish! Show some sensitivity. Sorry, sir. Did you see Mohit when you arrived at the party? Yes. And Baburam even opened the gate for you? 'I'm here to pick up my daughter.' Say it louder. Yes, but... I got there at around 2 am. But my daughter Arya was missing since 12:30 am. So you admit that they were at the party... ...but your daughter wasn't. Objection, leading the witness. Denied. What's all this nonsense in the court? According to the Supreme Court's maxim... ...the victim's statement is enough for a conviction... ...even I know that. But this maxim is based on the fact... ...that people can lie, circumstances cannot. Shall we, dear. You've been discharged. Shall we go home? Arya and Devki ma'am always had a problem with me. So it's quite obvious they took my name. And why will I do it, sir? I am in love with Arya. If I had been there that day... ...I would've never spared those guys. Will you please introduce yourself? I am Dr. Mohit Bhatt. I'm a Grade 1 Senior Scientific Officer... ...at the Central Forensic Laboratory. Did you prepare this report? - I did. What's written in it? The report is negative. The accused's forensic samples... ...and the samples collected from Arya's body do not match. How is this possible? Arya gave her statement 3 days later. The swabs were collected after 72 hours. The sperms were destroyed by then. But don't worry, we'll apply again. This time it will be positive. It's really unfortunate that the prosecutrix was raped. She has sustained severe wounds on her body. And there was an attempt to kill her as well. Since she was under the influence of alcohol... ...on the night of 14th February, her statement cannot be relied on. Even the Prosecution has failed to corroborate her statement. The court believes that... ...even if thousands of guilty go free,... ...not a single innocent soul should be punished. It cannot be proven without a doubt... ...that Charles Deewan, Mohit Chadha, Baburam Pande... ...and Joginder Singh committed the rape. And so the court acquits them. Jagan.... - Dude. What an amazing lawyer. Leave me. Take him out of the court. Arrest him! This is contempt of court. - Shut up! Anand, what happened? - Devki, this is really unfair. Where are you taking him? Hold on... - This is not justice. Wait...where are you taking him? Anand! - Ma'am please... Anand! - Devki. Wait madam, please. Anand! Thank you, sir. The court acquitted everyone. - I can't believe it. Sir punched Jagan in a fit of rage... ...and he was arrested for contempt of court. But don't worry ma'am, we'll get him out. He's here. Sir, sign here. I am so sorry about what has happened? I can understand what you'll are going through. There's no way you can understand. You can get away with rape in this country... ...but you can't even slap a rapist. The Police never discriminates. Anyone who breaks the law is our enemy. - Please... I've no more expectations. Not from the Police... ...nor the law. Yeah, Indu. Please open the door. - What happened? Arya saw her verdict on TV... ...and locked herself inside. - What was everyone doing? Why did you leave her alone? - Open the door. I couldn't do anything. - Open the door. Arya... - Arya, please. Arya... Arya, please. - Arya, open the door. Arya! - Oh, God! Arya. Calm down. Arya. Indu, take her away. Mom. Arya. Calm down, dear. Arya... No, Arya. Calm down. Arya. Arya. Calm down, dear. Arya... Calm down, dear. Calm down. Calm down, dear. Calm down. Calm down, dear. She's asleep. We can't give up, Devki. We must fight. We'll appeal to the High Court. They will be hanged to death. They will pay for this. Arya's the one paying the price. Living with this incident... Nothing can be worse than that. I always believed... ...everything will be eventually fine between Arya and me. But now it's all over. She has gone so far... ...and coming back is... I've lost her. I've lost her, Anand. You awake, dear. I've decided that... ...we should go out somewhere. How about that place you suggested? It's alright. But do let me know... ...once you change your mind. When will sis come back to school? Soon. Stop bothering me, Mohit. Your brother just got back. - Bye, mom. How many months into pregnancy you have been? How can you allow him back in school? - The court's acquitted him. He's innocent by law. So you're saying that my daughter's lying? That's not what I meant. But I can't take any action against him. What excuse can I give for expelling him? "That the court didn't believe Arya..." "...but we do?" So you won't do anything. His parents will sue the school. Morning, ma'am. - Morning... Stop calling me all the time.? Tell brother I am coming...coming towards him only. I had to bunk lectures because of you. Now hang up, stop bothering me. A lawyer like Bansal will definitely benefit our case. Go for it. I'll call you later. Devki, what happened to the car... - It's nothing. Just a small accident. Accident? Are you okay? Yeah, I am fine. No wonder you're so late. Indu also had to leave. - Anand... I cannot teach at that school any longer. And we'll shift Priya to another school. What happened? He's back in school. Who? Mohit? I suggest you find someone else. He's not a nice guy. What are you saying, DK sir? - Exactly. I wonder if my daughter will ever get married? I know of a guy. Fresh in the market. He'll be absolutely right for your daughter. Look... Tell me something, DK sir. Are you a detective or a matchmaker? Just your well-wisher, Mr. Bagga. Wait here. Where to? - Just check his profile. Madam, where are you going? Come in. I came here by mistake. You're holding my visiting card... ...and you claim to have come by mistake. How can I be of service? I know everything about your case. The court didn't just make a mistake... They have sinned. I can feel what you're feeling. No one knows what I am feeling. I may not be a good enough detective to deduce feelings... ...but I am a father nevertheless. I have a daughter...she's the same age as your daughter. Look at this, it's very beautiful. Thankfully she's taken after her mother. I can imagine what you're feeling. But don't worry, I am a professional. Client secrecy is my top priority. Swear on God. I... I want information. Done. You'll get the information. But... From this moment onwards, I don't know you... ...and you don't know me. Welcome to Rajiv Chowk Metro Station. Please stand clear of the door. Thank you. Monday nights Baburam gets off early from work. Every Monday night... ...he sits at the same bar and drinks till it shuts down. I don't know whether what I am doing is right or wrong. It's wrong. But doing nothing isn't right either. If you've to choose between wrong and not right... ...then what will you choose? The address of the bar. Is the information a 100 percent? Have faith in God. He'll fix everything. God can't be everywhere, Mr. DK. I know. That's why he created Mothers. It takes only one lifetime to be born as a woman. But only after one thousand and eighteen rebirths... ...does one get the privilege of being born as a man. Drunkard Rubbish! What? - You're talking rubbish. You've lost your mind. Get lost. - " Lipstick..." "Your waist...looks voluptuous." "Your waist...looks voluptuous." Don't be shy. Show me your face. Ratna... - Why are you screaming? Where were you the last three days? Why didn't you come home? I am asking you something. Who were you sleeping with? Are you going to answer me? Where had you gone? I want to know... - Shut up! Why did you come back? I even called at your office. You haven't even been to work for last four days! I had made up my mind to go to the police. Why marry me if this is what you wanted to do? Why are you screaming? I can scream too, you know. What are you smashing in there? Is that all you can do? It's my bad luck. "She called you four times..." "...but you didn't reply." "And also..." 'He was the same security guard who was recently arrested...' '...in connection to a gang-rape case.' Piyu! - Coming, mom. 'Security Guard Baburam was acquitted...' '...from the Valentine Day rape case.' 'He was found dead in his house, in castrated condition.' 'According to sources, he was missing for four days...' '...and he was last seen on Monday night at Vishwakarma bar.' Some neighbors saw him lying outside his house... This is definitely revenge. No, sir. They are decent people. Really? - Yes sir. How can I help you? You must have heard what happened with Baburam. He deserved whatever happened to him. The problem is, Mr. Anand, that this is no coincidence... it was deliberate. The question is who... - I wish it was me. My deputy Rashid, even he believes this is revenge-killing. But I said...it can't be you. You're decent people. Decent...but not stupid. You're suspecting me? You think I did it? I think a man's capable of doing anything when he's angry. Yes...I am angry. But I still have faith. That we will get justice. Nice to hear that. See you... Sorry for bothering you. Keep an eye on him. - Yes sir. This is his new series. It's an interesting take. We're in a gallery, Take off your sunglasses. People will laugh at you. I never leave home without my mother's blessings... ...and my sunglasses. Did you get the information I asked for? This must belong to an elephant. It's a pen-drive. I've already Whatsapped you the procedure... ...for disabling CCTV. You can go through it later. Leave five minutes after I do. Stay here for a while and appreciate this painting. What is this painting about? It's when Draupadi washed her tresses with Dushashan's blood. Look around you. This artist's theme is 'Mahabharata'. The oldest revenge story. Where is Draupadi? It's modern art. "Come out of this painting...' I could've made this painting... ...with my hands tied behind my back. Unbelievable. If you get it, it's art. If you don't, it's modern art. Excuse me. - Yes, sir. How can I help you? How much for this red canvas? 5 million. 5...million? - Yes, sir. It's already sold out. Did you receive payment? - Yes. Draupadi. 'Charles Diwan.' 'The only son of an Indian father and British mother.' 'His parents are no more...' '...but they left everything for him.' He live all alone in Greater Noida... ...Green Field society, bungalow 11 He's a partner in a nightclub. 'And every Saturday night he parties at that club.' 'Even his servant takes an off on Saturday night...' '...and, returns on Sunday morning.' 'And his cousin, Mohit Chadha, pet name Bunty.' 'Both his parents are pilots, and they often travel.' 'So he spends most of his time with his cousin Charles.' 'Both of them are very frequent in each other's home.' 'By the way, Charles always has a spare key to Mohit's house in his home.' 'Charles Diwan is a fitness freak.' 'From whey protein to creatine, he takes every supplement.' 'Let me know if there's any other information you want.' 'Well then...' 'Okay.' So what's the problem? Can't you get a single date for an appeal? I don't think you're interested in this case any longer. Hold on. Where are you going? - We're out of groceries. I'll be late. Also, need to see the tailor... I don't care if there are other cases pending. Now don't give me excuses, please. He's still at home. Do not lose sight of him, Rashid. No chance, sir. I haven't gone home for 3 days myself. I think he's very decent. It's been 6 days. Home to office, Office to home...that's all he does. He never even jumps a signal, even at night. He's a law abiding citizen. - I asked you to keep an eye... ...and not for your opinion. - Sorry sir. Can you open it? - Yes, madam. The gardener... I've told him a thousand times not to leave it here. The children can trip over. It's open. Come on...come on... - Here you go. The children will be home soon. Keep this money. Let's go...let's go.. It's okay, madam. Here you go, mister. Thank you. Sir. Hello? Who is this? What happened to bro? Huh! Which hospital? Where to madam? Hello... yes, I'm just downstairs. Coming up. Where are you going, madam? Yes... What? - Who do you want to meet? Mukesh Chabbra, 20-C. I see... - I'm coming. Madam, your name? - Mrs. Mathur. Fine, go. - Thank you. What's wrong with him? It's a case of poisoning, sir. I never took my eyes off him, sir. What's the poison? It's cyanide, sir. Made from apple seeds. - Apple seeds? Wait! Reports say that Apple seeds contain cyanide. It only takes 1.5 g to kill a human. And apple seeds contain 0.6 mg At the moment he's paralyzed. But the doctors are astonished about how he survived? Wait. We've found traces of protein shake and apple seeds... ...from his mouth and food pipe. Bro. - Is that what he ate last? Yes, sir, that's what he ate. And we've also collected evidence from his home. Who did this to you, bro? And... - It's not the father. I think someone else is involved. I want to know. He cannot speak. Now! Hello. Yeah. What? Fire? You should've checked first. - Even I heard the alarm, sir. Look the police are here. What's wrong? - It was a false alarm, sir. We checked the entire building. There's no fire anywhere. That was a close shave, mister. Mom and dad would've killed me. You can go. There's no fire, sir. We'll put it out even if there isn't one. Let's go upstairs. Rashid. - Yes, sir. Find out...what set off the alarm. - Okay, sir. Check everything. Bedroom and kitchen too You wasted your time once before... ...and you're doing it again. What do you think you're looking for, sir? I said it's a false alarm. Are you looking for buried treasure? Go find the one who poisoned my brother... - Shut up! Otherwise, I'll throw you out of the window. It's just the bathroom. Nature calls the police too. So this is what was going on here. Search properly, Rashid. I want all his drugs in front of me. Sir, this isn't mine. My dad sometimes... Sir, look. - Sorry sir. Honestly, sir, this isn't mine. Where did it come from? This is where the cyanide was prepared. Cooked enough to kill an elephant. What are you saying? Where were you last night? At home, sir. Isn't this your laptop? Look at this, sir. Jesus Christ. He researched last night. - Yes. Son of a gun...it's been ages since we had such a solid case. Take all this into evidence. - Yes, sir. Arrest the bas*** Come on. Hold on... wait... What for? Attempt to Murder. He's my brother. Why would I murder him? Maybe you were scared... ...that one of you might turn approver. Come on. Please. - Come on. You know I haven't done anything. - Come on! Arya. Arya dear, are you okay? Dear... Sorry. He was my best student. How did this happen, Charles? How did it happen? What happened to my daughter that night,... ...happens every night. After today, even you will never forget that night. You will think about that night every day... And regret it. What were you guys screaming that night? "CALL YOUR MOM?" Here's her mom. What happened to him? Poor boy got emotional seeing me. - What happened? Are you okay? See you. Get well soon, Charles. Yes, the meeting's on schedule. Of course, of course. Vinay, please be there on time. I'm sitting in the car. 15 minutes. Bye, mom. - Bye. Hello, Mrs. Devki. How are you? What brings you here, at the school? Is everything okay? Of course. I just came to see you. What do you want? I need your signature. What for? Well...the forensic lab wants to dispose off Arya's samples. If you want to get them examined by your own doctors... Then this is your last chance. Dispose them. I...need you to sign this. Sure. Sorry. Just one second. Are you...looking for this? Do you... ...wear the same kind of glasses? No... I can see everything clearly. Here... your pen. The fourth guy, Jagan Singh. He's Criminal class. He's dangerous. If I had two daughters... ...I would've never gone after him. Why are you telling me? Because he's the only one left. Believe it or not, but when the court acquits guilty people... ...it makes me really angry. I believe you. Then believe this too. When someone does my work for me... ...that makes me very angry too. I must go...I am getting late. - You can go, Mrs. Devki. But the moment I find evidence, I will take you along. Excuse me. What's wrong? You can't believe it either, right? Charles can die anytime... ...and then Mohit will be charged with murder. Does Arya know? I don't know. But she told me that she wants to go for a holiday. That's really great. Read the whole thing. Lots of work to do. Bookings are to be done. I'll get to work, okay. Anand. - Yeah. There's something I want to share... - You are worried about Arya? She's recovering.

It'll take some time. Jagan is missing. I even visited his hometown. His father passed away, but he didn't show up. The police are getting suspicious. Please hurry up.
