Aren't you called ﬁaban the Cow? -Be quiet! Did you check who's present? -I did, sir. Don't let me count one by one now. Is Ferit present? -I am, sir! -Good. Your presence means all the class is here. Tell me the subject of our last lesson? -I wasn't present last lesson. -You never are, are you? Who knows the subject of our last lesson? -Answer! Come on. -You told us about the mammals, sir. Good boy, sit down. No one listens in this class except you. What did we say? One; the mammals live on land, in sea and air. I prepared to cheat for an exam but he's doing a lesson instead. Two. The mammals have teeth in their jaws, three. They feed their offspring with milk, four. Some mammals feed on meat, others on grass. -Like you. -Come on! -Necmi, stand up. -Yes, sir. -What was I talking about? -The mammals, sir. -How many kind of mammals are there? -Three kind, sir. Upright, wrinkled, saggy. Sit down, you nasty! You tell us Ferit, come on. There are two kinds sir; big ones and small ones. -Sit down! You tell? Yes, you. -Me? Sir, there are two kinds of mammals. Ones with bra and others without bra. Sit down! I'll show you with and without bra! ﬁaban, tell us, what do the mammals feed on? -They feed by their mouths, sir. -No, not that, what do they eat? They feed on what they get, they're very obese, you know! -They eat meat. -What else? -Vegetables, sir. -Look, don't make me angry. -Say grass. -They eat grass. The ones like him eat shit. What is it? Why are you laughing? What's so funny? -You'll see. -Come on! You're up to something there again. Ferit, give us an example of flying mammal. Flying mammal... Stewardess. Slowdown, you'll stamp on us! Hope the new vice-principal would come and put them into some order. Shorty, why did you put grass on my desk again? -I thought you could put up with jokes. -This is horseplay though. Come on Shorty, kiss the Cow and be friends again. -Come on, there'sa match for compote. -Don't forgive him so easily, Cow! Right! Give me a cigarette, Shorty. You're causing too much expenses, nimble. We won't be able to smoke anymore, the new vice-principal is coming. We know! What if he does, you're such cowards! The principal's coming! Put out the ciggies! No principal, nothing. I was just joking! -That's what I call horseplay. -No, this is is cowplay! To get to the Adana lowland from Midanatolia... ...one passes through a natural passage between the Taurus Mountains. -You, with the glasses, what are you talking? -Nothing, sir. -So, what was I telling? -I'm sure you were telling something, sir. -What? -I'm saying the weather got warmer, sir. Okay well done. Yes, this road... -Are you nuts? Cemil's position was offside. -The referee's fault. -C 2. B 4. A 4. -Missed. -C 3. E 3. K 7. -Missed. My dear ﬁaban, my sweetie. I can't resist your wild charm anymore. -Quite, he'll hear. -He won't, he's a cow. Let's meet soon ﬁaban. Skip the school today. -I'm ready for the match already. -See you after lunch. ...the railroad passes valley via tunnels. ﬁaban the Cow won't play in the same team with Shorty. What were you talking there? Tell us the biggest pass of Mediterrenean region? Karakoy Passage, sir. There are also Sarachane and Aksaray Passages. Well done, sit down. The main rivers of the Mediterrenean Region.. We'll eat the compote, I'm in form today. Tell me the rivers of the Mediterennean Region? They flow down to the sea, sir. Mediterennean sea, it's us who come, not the enemy. The most powerful team of the Mediterennean is Adanaspor. Bravo, sit down. ﬁaban, put a clove... ...on your collar... ...so that I can recognize you. Kiss and bite you. Mediterennean region has a rich flora... What are you talking there? -I wasn't, sir. -Tell us the Mediterennean climate. In the Mediterennean the summers are hot and dry, and the winters are warm and rainy. Shut up. Aren't you ashamed to tell football games because I'm hard of hearing? You nasty. Hababam! Hababam! Hababam! Hababam!! If I could live on my pension, beacuse of Hababam class... ...I wouldn't stay a minute in this school. -The same with me. -Let's wait. The new vice-principal is coming today. Maybe he'll put these guys in order. I don't think so. I know Mahmut from Konya Highschool. He's not a tough guy. Mr. Principal couldn't keep them from playing football in the front garden no way. -Pardon? -Just listen to that noise! Not a sound from them today. Knock on wood. -Here you are. -Where were you? We ate half an hour ago. You're just bringing the coffees. What can we do? Which chore to do first? The dormitory is on me. Here you are. The cellar is on me. Here. I sweep the place. Here you are. I help the cook. It's the third times I'm warming up beans. -Why? -Guess why? Hababam Class didn't eat yet. -So what? -What do you mean? Do you think I can work when they are hungry? Hafize, if you could, you would swaddle those big donkeys and put them to bed. Please. Sir S˝tk˝, let me introduce you our new vice-principal Sir Mahmut. Our mathematics teacher Sir S˝tk˝. -S˝tk˝ the Kurd. -Nice to meet you, sir. The new vice-principal! -Welcome. -Thank you, sir. Our geography teacher Sir R˝za. -Welcome Mahmut. -Kemal, you're here, too? After retirement we took refuge in here. -Say, like me. -So you know each other. -Right. -Our biology teacher Sir Necmi. -How are you, sir? -Thank you. -Our philosophy teacher Sir L¸tf¸. -Welcome Sir Mahmut. -Thank you, sir. -Excuse me, can't see clearly. And Sir Nuri is our physics teacher. -Unfortunate accident. -Do you see our school? -They turned it into a stadium. -Why they don't play in the front garden? How many times I've forbidden it. Do you think they listen? Nevermind, better it hits objects than the body. -Mr. Principal! -What is it? Aren't you ashamed to ask for the ball? I won't give it. -Please, forgive just this once. -Shut up, stay away! Please, it's just an accident. I'll talk to you later. You run away from school every night lately. -We'll payfor the broken glass. -Give them their ball. Delicious. May God bless the ones who plays for compote. Drink it, this isn't idiot's compote but cow's compote. -You... -Don't put up with him my son. -Okay. -Don't ever take this cow into the team. Don't get on my nerves now that I don't say anything, ok? My brave son don't get angry. And drink your compote. What is compote to a donkey? -Now is the right time for a cigarette. -Don't drink that shit everywhere. -The new vice-principal came. -How is he? -He looks like a mellow guy. -What if he is a severe guy? -Hafize, they're calling you from upstairs. -Here I come. You behave yourselves. ﬁaban, light up one. Thank God we don't need anybody's cigarette. Just let me have one. -Principal is coming. Throw it away. -You can't fool me again. -ﬁaban! What's that? -Cigarette. Cigarette! Here, take this cigarette! -Here's the room for the teacher on duty. -Where will the teacher sleep then? No one stays at school. Veysel, the doorman, and me. Understood. -I want to ask you something. -Ask. If you'll stay at school you don't have a family. -Yes, I don't. -I'll take care of you too. -I'll do your laundry. -It'll be a trouble for you. What trouble? It'll take two minutes. Are you crazy? Come on, wipe the board slower, we're getting itchy. -Dear Cow, you have a letter. -My sweetie has written again. What's going on? What will you do with the cat? For the physics class. The teacher will show us how they always lands on all four. -No cats in the class. -Why cats can't when there are cows? -I gave the letter. -You have a letter again? From my love, she decided to meet me at last. -You're kidding, Cow, let me see. -I won't! Catch this! -What are you looking for, son? -I lost it. -I can see. Take your seat. -Okay, Mr. Principal. This is the class of Hababam, sir. Sit down! Let me introduce your new vice-principal and your history teacher Sir Mahmut. -You can begin your lesson, by your leave. -Thank you. In this first lesson, let's get to know each other if you want. It would be nice. -I am Ferit Eken. -We call him Ferit the Groom. Ferit, the Groom, how old are you? 25, almost 26. I don't look like, righr sir? -Yeah, right. -Get lost! Your agemates finished the university and you're still in college? I'm not in hurry, we digest what we learn. -How old are you? -23. -What's your name? -I'm called Necmi, the Shorty. -You don't haven a surname? -My surname... what was it? So you're 23 years old, Shorty. -Yes. -What's your father's job? I don't know forsure but I guess he's doing shady business. -Moo! -You! -Who's that cow? -I am, sir. Nice to meet you. Why do they call you Cow, do you study a lot? -It's not about studying. -He's a natural born cow! -Why are you still at college? -Girls don't leave me alone. They say I have a wild charm, yes. Cow charm. In every school the teachers also have nicknames. Don't search a name for me, they call me Bald Mahmut. I've lost my hair during my teacher life of 25 years. What I see and hear about your class is not so nice. I hear you're playing hooky, I won't let you. I saw you playing football in the front garden, I won't let you. -Obviously you smoke. -Absolutely no, sir, we never touch one. Don't let me see you smoking, I'll hurt you. As for the cheating,.. ...neither in my lesson nor in someone else's, I won't let you cheat. -For your information. -We never cheat, sir. Sit down! And don't talk without permission! I don't want noise, patter, fights in the school. I'll hurt you. You'll be on time for lessons and meals... ...you'll sleep and get up right on time. He's like a clock! If you do these things I said, we'll get along well. If you don't, it's your choice. I hear you're playing hooky, I won't let you! I hear you're cheating, I won't let you! You're playing football in the front garden, I won't let you. We'll play anyway. -I hear you're smoking, I won't let you! -We'll smoke. Haven't I told you not to smoke! Sir Mahmut! Shorty, they call this a horse play, all right? Most of the boarders come from Anatolia, sir. Their family just turn them over to us and run. They just send their school instalments, that's all. They never call the kids. It's not an easy task. For a pupil we get 9.000 Lira. Shall we use this for their meals, their beds or their hygiene? -Which class is this up there? -Class of Hababam. By God! Even I got used to call them that way; senior class of Literature. Unfortunately, they are just over your head. Hop. Boom! Stand firm, Shorty, I'll break your waist. Come on Cow, jump, do we have to wait you? Attention pals, Shorty's gonna die now. Here comes flying Cow, pay attention! The imam of the village, feeds the straw from below. The smoke rises above, this and that how many did he score. -What are you doing! -Attention! To your places. Hababam Class is ready for inspection with 26 members. Sit down, here is not barracks. You nasty guys, so you play games in the class? Put away the books. Bring out the sheets; I'll do a written test. Where did we pu tthe physics questions? What are we gonna do now? We don't know a thing. If we can't disrupt the lesson with his military stories, we're done. I suspect the ones who waits their teacher playing games. When we were at your age, on horse back... ...we were chasing the enemy in Sakarya. Shorty! -With your permission, Pasha. -Talk When the Greeks blew up the bridge at Sakarya... ...my father brought three soldiers swimming across. Wounded, hungry. Sit down my son, don't cry, you'll make me cry too. Such a generation we were, we saved this country bare foot,.. ...hungry but with the faith in here. Hurra, sir! At dawn, we started to bomb the enemy lines. Long live, sir. At the head of my troop, I was waiting orders from the headquarters, without blinking. My soldiers, forward march! One, two. Left, left. We can't recruite young and talented teachers at our school. We can't pay what they want, of course. -Yes, please. -All our teachers are old. Thank you. There is no teacher in the class of Hababam, Mr. Principal? No, but Pasha Nuri was going to do a test, obviously they're disrupting the lesson. The enemy was defeated, Kemal Pasha gave his order. Armies, your first goal is Mediterrenean, forward! -Sorry, sir, I thought the class is idle. -It's not, I'm here. -I thought you were the physics teacher. -You're right, our lesson is physics. But what am I doing here? You get me down! -Come here! -Yes, my Pasha! God damn your Pasha! You were the first to take me up your shoulders, right? -Yes, my Pasha. -Get back to your places. Get lost! Shorty started the show and we'regetting the blame. -Come on, I'm gonna do a test. -Sir. You don't have time, I guess. I couldn't quiz this class for three months. -Why, sir? -I don't know! Everytime I try to quiz, I find myself on shoulders. What disturbs me most is Veysel, the doorman's show off. He says he lets no one out without Mahmut's permission. What can we do? If Sir Mahmut closed the front door. Then we'll open another door. He'll see if Hababam Class can or cannot run away from school? What's happening? Not finished yet? -Not much left. -You keep an eye on. Are we cursed or something? We became slaves! Kids, look at Cow. -Cow, are you running too? -The girl's waiting me in Taksim. She'll know me by my clove. All right, the hole's open, come on. Guys, Sir Mahmut's here, don't come. Are they all looking from windows? -Yes. -They're looking up here, right? Yes. -We've made fools of ourselves. -We lost our reputation. Even the youngers are watching us. Well done, work. You won't be able to finish the school... ...at least you'll have career. You should make the things you destroyed. Also masonry is not a bad job. Go ahead! Sit down, sit down. What happend? You are very quiet today! Well done Sir Mahmut. How did he made you put up the wall? We became an object of derision! As they say, one would be stronger than other one. If you are Hababam Class, he is Sir Mahmut. He's looking for trouble! Let's perform! It means that you need someone like Sir Mahmut. You see! -What happened? Do you want something? -Sir, I am... ...a supervisor from the national education Hikmet Gorkem. Please come in, Sir Gˆrkem! -How are you boys? -Thank you! You're welcome. -He ttok the bait. -Yes. Please sit down sir. What is the subject of the lesson, sir? -The lesson is "Logic", sir. -Good. Can I ask some questions to them, sir? -Of course, sir. -You! -I'm asking you! -Stand up Cow! Stand up. Did you said to me, bub? Sir. I said "come here" You're looking like a cow to me. He says cow! Your mother... ...I recognize her but I can't remember where. Sir, I think this kid is a little idiot. He looks like cow. He still says cow! -His friends call him as Cow. -Come here. Come on, come on. Tell me, do the cows have logic? -Cow is your dad! -It's a bit much! You, nasty! -I'll beat him with your sanction. -Sanction is yours, sir. -God bless your hands. -Come here, you ribald! -You impish! You cow! -Don't hit! -Sit down! -Your mother... Okay? Sit down. I'm sorry to bother you, sir. Is that you Sir Mahmut? The supervisor came to my class. -The supervisor? -Yes, sir. That's why I came, sir. The director wants to talk with... ...the supervisor about an important subject. -Come on, sir. -Let's go. -Excuse me, sir? -Of course, sir. This time G¸d¸k will definitely be kicked out so that I'll get rid of him. You know, that the penalty of your behavior is getting kicked out. But I'll not punish you. I understand, you're young, you have right to have fun and laugh. But you don't have the right to humilite someone... ...by taking advantage of his disabilities. Especially when this person is your teacher. You'll understand this in time. Go on. Write down. Fifth and the last question. The heritage diagram of mirabilis uniflora. -There's no copy of that. What will we do? -I don't know. Boncuk, do you know the last one? Don't talk! Don't look around! Don't lean under the tables! I'll take your papers! Attention! Five, four, three, two, one, zero. Start! Don't copy from somebody! I never let my students cheating... ...in my 30 years teaching life. He never let cheating. -«etin. -What's up? Send these questions to Mother Hafize! Hababam Class cheats, right? Let's cheat and we'll see! -Who is under the floor? -Kemal from the science class. I've got him for a pack of cigarette. -What's wrong with you? Are you sick? -No, I'm not. -Why did you wear a coat? -I'm sick sir. I feel cold. Get well soon. I'll challenge the student... ...who can duped me, or cheat on my lesson. Donít move! Mona Riza! Lift your foot. Shorty. You wrote the notes upside down. What do I do now? -Teacher is looking. -Jackass! Bravo.You write very well. If you work hard, you can do it. We studied a lot sir, didnít sleep last night. Arenít we? -Whatíre you doing there? -My hands had been inked. I wrote, take it. Bastard! Heís smoking down there. -You. -Me, sir? Yes you, put your hands up! Donít move, you swallowed something. Yes sir, I swallowed a candy. Sir! Excuse me, I'm disturbing you. Welcome Sir Mahmut! -Youíre making a test I guess. -Right. Donít move! They got used to cheat in other lessons, but I'm cracking down. During my 30 year of career, There is not even one student who cheated. How would they dare? Donít move. -Sir excuse me, have a nice teaching. -Thank you. No one can cheat in my class! -Beans looks so delicious. -Sir, won't we eat dinner? I told you not to cheat. Sir, I wonder, how long one can go hungry? -I guess three days. -Good, so Shorty will die tomorrow. Sir Mahmut, couldnít you find any other punishment? They going to die of hunger. Cheating is no big deal, forgive them. You stay out of this. No forgiveness. -They know their fault. -Sir, I feel dizzy because of hunger. Hang on, hunger is good, you get rid off your extra kilos. -How can we be full up with water? -Donít drink much, it may cause diarrhea. I think Sir Mahmut will be so much trouble. -Whatís up? You look bad. -I'm very hungry, I can even eat you. Iíll fool Mother Hafize and get us some food. Domdom, turn down the volume. Kikirik, music heals the soul. Listen so you can be full up. -Whatíre you eating Saban? -Churchkhela, roasted chickpea. -Delicious, my father sent them. -Give me some buddy! -No way. -You just wait. Here, a pot of rice.

Listen, we will meet at five oíclock at the ferry port. -Okay? -Okay. Good luck guys! We will bunk off in a way that it will be glorious. Now Sir Mahmut will see the Hababam Class. Attention! Shun! Forward march! Stop! -Where are you going? -Open the gate, Sir Veysel. We go to welcome the president of Uganda republic by order of Mr. Mahmut. Okay. Stamp well on the parade. Come on! Shun! Step! March! Sit down, sit down. You are so quiet again. As the saying goes, diamond cut diamond. How did he put you in order, Sir Mahmut. God bless you Sir Mahmut You made Hababam Class putty in your hand. -What did I do? -What else will you do? Look at this silence. Seems like they are not at the school. Thanks to you, we live quitely! They were never silent before. -Sir Mahmut. -Yes, sir. -I think Hababam Class is not up there. -Excuse me? I checked the tables with my hands but couldnít find anyone. Welcome lions. How was the walking? -Did Sir Mahmut asked for us? -No. I said "You sent the children... ...to welcome the president." He said "yes, I sent them." Why didnít he come to greet us. It's the new game of Sir Mahmut. Hang on! Shame on him. I regret. Look, Sir Mahmut is at the stairs. Welcome. Did you see the president of Uganda? -How is he? Fine? -He said hello to you. Thank you. You took enough air today. There will be a penalty for this. You are not allowed to go this weekend. What a pity! Everybody is outside. I wish Iíll be in that ship. Give me the binoculars. Look, he's walking around with his love. Everybody is going to Kadikˆy we are drowsing here. What a luck! Imagine! You are with your girlfriend. I wanted to go to disco, Osman would come with three girls. -Now, he is alone -I was going to the island last week. Iím mostly upset for the match. Betrayer woman! Why did you keep me waiting in Taksim for three hours? -What are you writing, Cow? -Iím writing a letter for my love. Whatís going on, Groom? Early in the morning. I have to go today, or she will worry about me. I have an headache cause we don't have a cigarette. You are still sleeping. Itís 9 oíclock. Come on! Wake up to the breakfast! -We will not eat Mother Hafize. -We are going to die of hunger. -Sir Mahmut will get rid of us. -God forbid! We donít have cigarettes. If we donít smoke after dinner, we die. -Thatís why we donít eat. -If you find cigarettes for us, weíll eat. -If we donít smoke, weíll die. -Youíll tug at my heartstrings. Alright. Iíll go and buy. Bless our Mother Hafize, God! Amen. Guard us from evilness of Bald Mahmut. Send him away immediately, God! Amen! -Smoke for the soul of the betrayer Bald! -Smoke! -We became rats. -Quiet! We will be captured. He can't capture us here in the attic. You were going to burn the whole school. I said not to smoke! We are addicted, sir. What can we do? -We got used to smoke, sir. -Yes, they got used to smoke. If I donít smoke, I crock up. Itís so easy, we will institutionalize you. If you institutionalize Shorty, Iíll stop smoking, I promise. Who did bring you these cigarettes? I said who? Iíll find him. Where is Ferit? -I asked you something. -He's sick, in his bed. Sick! I took his meal upstairs but he didnít eat. He has a fever. Sick, right? Are you sick too? You donít talk with your teacher. What did I do to you, boys? You played hooky, scoffingly. Should I say bravo to you? Donít look at me like enemy. My students looked at me that way all my life, Iím used to it. I just tried to teach them nice things... ...and show the right way. But when I look back... ...I see that I did not succeed. I spend all my life bu spreading in every corner of Anatolia. Everytime I punish a student for his mistake... ...there was an insensitive bigwig conservator... ...or an administrator that says I go too far. I just wanted the kids... ...have responsibility and do their duties. It was enough for my happiness. But it never happened. I spent my life for nothing.
