My daughter was still small when I got pregnant again. I said it was an accident, but... it was premeditated. My son was an excuse not to leave my sweet home. But with two, it's more complicated. Longer days. They're eating me alive. I'm suffocating. I'm afraid of everything, now. Especially of them dying. I'm sure everyone has the same thoughts. Watching your child sleep and wondering, what if that body were a corpse? If those eyes were shut forever. I can't help it. At night, I dream of them suddenly disappearing amidst an indifferent crowd. I yell, "Where are my children?" And people laugh. They think I'm crazy. Stop it, Adam! Shit, I don't believe it! Mila! - What have you done now? - Nothing! He fell all on his own. Right. It's never your fault, is it? All on his own! He tried to climb on the table, then he fell. You okay? Yes... Tired of doing nothing and looking whacked. You don't do nothing! You're incredible, at it all day with the kids. You're magnificent. It'd do me good to go back to work. Really? Would you mind? What? If I did? No... - No, what? - No, nothing. Difficult when they're little. I mean, it works well. I know it's not always easy for you, but it works. I love being with them. If I could have done it... I love being with them too! But I need something else. It's nice having wife and kids at home! That's not true. That really gets me. You chose. It could have been otherwise. How so? I'll put out an ad for a nanny. The crèche? I've updated our request. No luck so far. Call all the local childminders if you want! His teeth make him cry, so I can't even talk on the phone! A nanny will cost us your whole salary. That doesn't bother me. I need to be doing something. I need another topic of conversation! Adapted from the novel by Leïla Slimani THE PERFECT NANNY Hello. Come in. I'm a student - psychology - so it's as you like. Lectures in the evening... I reckon looking after kids will be good experience. This is a first for our daughter so she's not always good with authority. What if she won't leave the park? I tell her we're going to buy sweets, then after, I say I left my purse behind, and when we get back I say, "I tricked you!" I love boys. They're so cute. Hey, baby! Don't cry, sweetheart! We do stories together, then bit by bit we can do plays... I sing in Spanish, too. Really? Great! I can talk to the kids... - In Spanish. - Spanish, yes. When are you available? We may sometimes be home late, not the same every day. That's difficult. It's important I can go out... Myriam's a lawyer and I'm in music. It's unpredictable. I need to know from what time to what time. It's very important I know times. We'll let you know soon. Well, I hope you will, sir. You can try me for a week. When it's hot my ankle hurts, but then it goes away. - You won't be disappointed. - Thank you. Goodbye. Okay? Not too demoralised? No, but it's exhausting, isn't it? If we don't get someone now, we'll look elsewhere. I'll go. - Hello. - Pleased to meet you. Come in. In the sitting room. I took the liberty of arriving five minutes early. No worries. A glass of water? A coffee? No, thank you, I'll be fine. Pleased to meet you. Shall I introduce us? Yes, very well. We have two children. Our daughter, Mila, is five, at school down the road, and Adam, the baby, is 11 months. He's at home all day. Aren't they here today? Yes, they're napping. They share a bedroom. My turn? - Yes. - Go ahead. Well, my name is Louise. Excuse me, but I believe someone is waking up. I'll go. Excuse me. Just coming! Sorry. You can carry on. I've been a childminder for a long time. I've mainly worked for two families, staying alongside their children for many years. And really, that's what suits me best. That continuity. Hello, Mila. Is that your name, Mila? My name is Louise. Do you have children? A daughter, Stéphanie, whom my husband and I brought up. But, well, Jacques is dead now. But Stéphanie is grown up. She's 25. And how are you for availability? I'm very available. Actually... I've written down my former employers' details. At the top is the last family I worked for, the Rouviers. They had two children too. Boys. Good. A special one? - What's his name? - Bun-bun. Bun-bun? What a nice name! Hello. What? No... As I told you, those are Paul's vinyls. The children know they mustn't touch them so of course they're dying to! Now, the Babycook. It's often on 3 but I prefer not. On 2, or it holds too much water. That's for steaming vegetables, this is for mash... I guess you know all that... I'm very fond of this, please be careful. Same thing, Mila loves parading in it! But she knows she mustn't. I'm sorry. - Your keys are in the kitchen. - I saw, Myriam. You can go. It's all fine. - Kiss-kiss, darlings. - Bye-bye, Mummy. Do the code? Will you turn the page? Yes, it's orange! - See you this evening. - Bye, Myriam! You scared me! I didn't hear you come in. I didn't want to disturb you. All okay? Yes indeed. Hats Gloves Undies Oh dear, Adam, you're choking! Nice to be clean, isn't it? Who's going to lie down and have a nice nap? Mila. Come here. Something to show you. Hang on, I'm doing my stickers. Come on, you can finish later. - Know what this is? - Hammer. And now? - Now do you know? - Coat hanger! Exactly. Your coat hanger. That's where you'll hang your coat now, okay? Go and get it. Hang it up. There! With the truck... Adam! Not in your mouth, darling. Hang on. No! Hey, you! Give me that truck. It's not yours! Give me it, it's not yours. It's not your toy! What's going on? The child you're supposed to be minding stole a toy that isn't his. Listen, he's little, it's not the same as us. You do your job and mind that child! Okay, sorry. Things can be lent. Look, here, look. I got it back! Evening! How are you? - Haven't seen you lately. - I'm back at work. How about you? Okay, but I'd rather be at the beach... What can I get you? One chocolate eclair, a lemon tart, and a Nutella eclair, as usual. Your nanny's great. She's firm with your daughter, chats to the baby... - Really good with them. - Is she? And I see lots of nannies. Lemon, was it? Anyone can see she loves your kids. One, two, three! If you play with them, you put them away. Cheeky! No, don't throw them. No... You took my pencil! You'd better leave them alone. Mila, don't brush your teeth yet. Come back here. Look. Nothing there? Yes. What is it? Yoghurt. There's lots left. We mustn't waste. Mummy must have said. Yes? So what do we do with this? Dunno. We lick it. There. There, sit down. And lick it out. Good. You can go and brush your teeth. Hey, Paulo. Bro! - This is Myriam. - Hi, Myriam. I'm with Jimmy all day long. No kids tonight? We had their bottles for the vodka, but Adam's at a rave this evening. Very funny! We'll bring them next time! Do that! This is Edward. He's a genius. He's got a group, Darionomy, worked in Britain... I sent you the EPs. - Fancy a dance? - No, thanks. Do you smoke? - Yes. - I've got a great trick. See the logo? It's gone! I must be off my face. No, it's real magic. Shall I tell you? Don't tell anyone, will you? I'm under oath, you know. So there are two lighters. 1, 2, 3... You with me? But I can also make it disappear. And there it is. All okay? Coming for a dance? Yes! He only showed me a magic trick! Are you jealous? I'm not jealous. He got on my nerves after a while. - Er, Myriam...? - What? No more joints for you. Have a good weekend, then. A drink, Louise? - Rosé? - Lovely, thank you. I've had enough, here. We need to move. Are you looking? No, but I dream of it. A bedroom for each child, at least. So... To you. To your fantastic family. Thank you. Excuse me Myriam, I wanted a word. I found yoghurts in the bin. It's a real shame to waste food. Weren't they past their date? Yes, but you can still eat them. Yes, but I prefer not. Especially the kids. I've already given them ones that were past their date. It did them no harm. Have you? But I assure you, you can eat them two or three weeks after the date, no danger. Louise, I don't like that. You're right about waste, but please stick to the date on the pot. I forbid you to give them food past its date. Even one day past? Yes, even one day. Very well. Turtles are major victims of ever growing plastic waste. A clinic is nursing them. Cape La Houssaye is a jewel of marine biodiversity. A coral garden overrun with plastic waste. Turtles are often found by divers, in the throes of death. Here, dozens of volunteer divers have answered an appeal sent out on social networks and a rescue network is being put together. They get the turtles... - Louise... - Hello Myriam. I've made coffee. Thanks. You're here so early! I don't sleep much, so I like to get on here. I see. Like me at work! See you this evening. My roast lamb. My little Sunday roast. My love... Louise? Louise, I'm going to find you! Louise? You didn't find me. Sylvie! Hello, gorgeous! Hello, I'm Paul's mother, Sylvie. Hello. I'm Louise. I know who you are. Give him to me. You're so cute! Mila, take my things. Bring them up, please. What a handsome boy! What are you doing? Mila? Come here, sweetie, I must brush your hair. She's with me! Well now? Tired, are we? Come on! You won't win. Come on! Eskimos do this. Japanese kisses? I know! What about pussycats? Like this. And what do little fish do? It's raining... candy! Raining candy. Lots of candies. What's going on here? Hello, Myriam. Hello. You leave late, don't you? Yes, she helps me! - Goodbye. - Goodbye, Sylvie. Goodbye, Madame. MILA'S BIRTHDAY PARTY This is your favourite. Lie down, darling. Coming? Louise made it herself for me. It's very pink! It'll be lots of fun. Here they are! - Can we play hide-and-seek? - Yes, we can! One, two... Ten. Here comes the wolf! I can smell fresh meat! I'll eat the children! Come here, Louise! There she is! Stop! You're all out! Now really fast. Surprise! Already? My sweetheart! Both my sweethearts! Come here. I'll do that, Louise. I came home specially. Enjoy your children, I'll prepare supper. But I've ordered a take-away. I'll do it. You were right about the sleeping bag. Adam seems more... He seems to have longer naps. - See you tomorrow. - Bye. You're too hot. Want some? No. No, thank you. At home we always share food. Only here do people eat alone. Here. Alphonse, don't tell Mummy. It's a secret. Okay? No, she won't have any. Go on, Louise! Mila, I said no. Yes! No means no. Come and play, Alphonse. My name's Wafa. The others said you're Louise, but they don't dare talk to you. I look after Alphonse, you know? Mila likes playing with him. He's at her school. Baby's sleeping well. Very sweet. He's called Adam. That's a nice name! It's biblical. Adam's in the Koran too. - Really? - Yes. Adam's a Muslim name, too. We say "Ehdam". It's nice. I didn't know the name Mila. Mila! What did I say, when we come in? Time for some kisses! You smell of baby. I love that smell. Come here so I can eat you up! Adam! No, not Adam. My trophy! Hello. Thanks for coming. There was a little incident. We were working on vocabulary and I asked them for words in the same family as 'cat'. One boy said 'caterpillar', and Mila said, "No, it's 'caterpillow'." So I laughed, of course, the whole class laughed, the little boy told Mila she was rubbish and Mila hit him with her ruler. Just below the eye. It could have been nasty. I can imagine. I'm really sorry. I think just now you need... to pay attention to her. Be there. It's true, I'm very taken up with my work right now. And I'm sorry I sent the nanny instead of me. You know what parents say the most to their children? "Hurry up." - How are things, Louise? - Fine. Your dinner is ready, with a vegetarian dish for Emma. Louise, you must stay, we're celebrating. Paul's producing a well-known singer! Well-known or not... Come on, you're pleased! And Myriam is about to win her first case. Anyway, we'd love you to have dinner with us. He didn't know whether he should invest, but I've seen FX and when he goes above 72K a year he invests. For starters, it's daft but... And all of a sudden he begins to scream. Such screams! Until we do what he wants. Not really tantrums. How old is he? Nearly six. Yes, I've seen that before. His pedopsychiatrist is great, luckily, but... It started when I gave up breastfeeding. He was 3 1/2, and I think it was a bit tough. But I'm there for him. And medication at his age seems a bit... No, you mustn't... Homeopathy or... No, you can't medicate a five-year-old. When to cut the cord, when to reach out... I don't think you should go back to breastfeeding. I mean, mentally. It's property prices. Rich people in poor neighbourhoods. He'd have been the only white child! The local school is a nightmare. The language I hear! All kids know "fuck", but they don't all say it the same way. I know we shouldn't give up, it's important, all that, but what'll I do when he comes home invoking God or speaking Arabic? They play "Kalash Charlie" in the playground! Is it ready? Shall we eat? Diversity's a good idea... Of course a social mix is rewarding. I spend half my holidays with... That's not the point. I'll go. She's funny, isn't she? Really sweet. She's great. Salmon coulibiac! My God! It's magnificent! Emma, specially for you. - May I help myself? - Of course, please do. - I can't wait. - It was my mother's favourite. - The big one? - Yes. The feminists won't like it, but we all want a nanny, don't we? Wives are like nannies. No need to be feminist, you could just try to be less dense. I love you like that! We're going on holiday with our nanny! It'd be great, no? A real holiday for us, and for you... Don't you think? Would you like to? Yes, I'd be very happy to be there for the children. Welcome! Good afternoon. I want to sleep here. No. The bottom one. It's too dangerous. Up here? Listen! They're there. Look! There's one on that rock! Look at the pretty blue sea! Look, a little lizard! Louise, come here for a photo. This is magnificent. I'm going to add a bit of salt... A little bit of sugar... Come on, salt! Yes, salt and sugar. And some flour, too! Maybe some vanilla. Louise, come into the sea! Come on! No, not now. Come on! Leave me be! All right, sweetheart? Okay, darling? Louise, what on earth...? Actually, I don't know how to swim. It'll be easier beyond the waves. - No! - Come on. It's too shallow to swim here. Nothing can happen. I'm here. Thank you! - I got you a bit. - A bit. See you tomorrow. I think we'll sleep in tomorrow. Okay. But if you want some time for yourself after that... And we can swim late afternoon. Okay... Have a nice evening. No, I'm staying with the children. You have to, now. Okay. Okay, Mila? what are we going to talk about? the children I guess that way we can big up the work she does because we can't do that about her swimming... Sorry... Goodnight. Off to bed. 'Night. Goodnight. Don't you miss having a man in your life? Louise? Do you miss living with a man? I don't want a man under my feet. Enough of taking care of someone. Apart from the children... And when they're gone? They'll always be there. Will you take them to work when they're grown up? They'll have another one. They still have sex. Number three will come soon. I'll be with the others while she's pregnant, then it'll be the little one. They'll let me. They trust me. They know. Magic pregnancy potions Old wives' recipes Would you like another little brother or sister? I don't know. If you did, it'd be a baby for you and me to take care of. Wouldn't that be nice? It'd be fun, wouldn't it? What do you say? What's more, if you had a little brother or sister then we'd move house. And in the new house, you'll have a room of your own. If you say so... We can have several suns. Can we? Who says there's only one sun? My suns are the best. Evening, Myriam. Can I take the kids out to eat? Then you two can have a quiet dinner. I don't know, Louise. It's not what we had in mind. Maybe another time? Please, Mummy? Go on, Mummy! We'd like to, just this once. - Are you pleased? - Yes. Hello! Here. You sit on the chair. We'll have sausages and chips, please. To share. Fine. What will you drink? Water, please. Nice, isn't it? Grown-up glasses. Your health! To you. To us! Us three. Maybe us four, soon. We mustn't forget you! Want a little sip? Wine... Local wine? Tell me, what name would you give your little brother or sister? I don't know. Shall we have a think? Look for a nice name? I don't know. You could ask Mummy. You could say, "I'd like us to have a baby. "I'd like a bigger family." Will you? Yes. A bit more sausage? Here's your bill. Thank you. What time is this? Thank you, Louise. A restaurant! You're a big girl now, aren't you? Where's Mummy? I hardly saw her. She went straight to bed! A bath and then bed. And you're going to bed too. Are you okay? Yes... See you Monday. Look. Mila? Mila! Have you seen a little girl with plaits? - No... - Didn't she come past? Come on. Come on. I'm sorry. Stay there. Sleep. What...? Are you mad? Why did you run off like that? Are you crazy? What were you doing? Why was this little girl all alone? I could give her to the wardens. Her parents wouldn't be happy. My little darling! You gave me a fright, silly girl! Pay attention next time. Yes, I will. Never go away like that, understood? Do you want someone to steal you? A man will, and no one will hear you and come for you. Do you know what men do? He'll take you, hide you and keep you for himself. You'll never see your brother again. I've just read the opposing party's conclusions. The judge may not give a verdict about the children by then. Yes, call me in a few days. Goodbye. Good day in the park? Was it nice? Very. - Did you go on the big slide? - Yes. Louise? Yes? Can you come to the kitchen? Yes, of course. Have you seen this? - It's a bite mark, isn't it? - Yes, I know. But I put cream on to heal it. Mila bit him. - Were you there? - Yes, I was. They were playing, I was making supper. I heard Adam scream, I didn't know why, so I went, I saw nothing... But that's because Mila bit him through his clothes. Are you sure, Louise? I've asked Mila several times, said I wouldn't punish her and she swore she didn't know. Okay. I really don't like breaking a promise that I made to a child but, well... Did Mila do that? Please, I count on you not to say anything. If our bond of trust was broken I think it would perturb her even more. Don't you? Jealousy is normal. Let me deal with it and it will all be fine, okay? Maybe, yes. I don't understand. Don't try to understand everything. Children are like adults: nothing to understand. Is that your mummy's? Nice, isn't it? Don't tell her. You won't, will you? Hello, my darling! What on earth? You have to be joking! Stop, it hurts! Make-up isn't good for your skin! You can't wear mascara. You're five! I'm not a baby. Don't scold Mila, it was me. In five minutes it's all gone. All right. Really, making her up like that! It was a game. We made each other up. She looks like a whore! With a straw hat Two people in love Mila is pretty And everyone wants her Without hesitating Hugo asks her No hanging around They're getting married! In December A nice little bedroom In January A nice little baby! Hello all! Let's get the bags ready, I'm kidnapping you. You're coming with me. No, sorry, but nobody told me. That's because it was unforeseen. Surprises are fun, Louise! Hello, gorgeous! We're going to have a lovely time. A whole week! Kiss? We're going to have such fun! Hello, Louise. Who's this? It'll be great! How are you? Hello Myriam. Hello, Sylvie. We're going to pack. I'm sorry, but in the end Sylvie is taking them. Yes, she said. She was in Paris anyway. So those few days there all together are off now. But we'll still pay you. No difference. Sylvie offered to have them so we can have two days alone. Goodbye. Morning. There's no signal here. No more phone, then. But I must send an email. I'll miss the deadline. Louise was hurt when your mum came to get the children. - Was she? - As if Sylvie was stealing the kids. I felt we were depriving her. Her holidays aren't our problem! Come on! The trampoline! Careful. There are bibs, Sylvie, did you not see them? I didn't think to look. Let him get dirty at his age... He can be clean later on! So you're moving, are you? No, we have no plans to, why? I thought... And Mila mentioned a little brother or sister. Definitely not! Over my dead body. - Little crocodiles? - And fish! How big were they? Like so? And I saw crocodiles here, Daddy. - Crocodiles? - And I swam. There are little ones here, like this. Of course. There often are in rivers. Liar liar, pants on fire! We went a long way and saw horseses in the river. Horseses, really? Horses, I mean. And I went on them, and they ran into the river. We're ready to strike for three months, more if we must, and fight. As long as it takes. We're fighting for people, not against them. We're service users too, it's for us too. Macron's government is going after public services, we're all under fire and we support them... Consequence: already over 400 km of hold-ups in all. I'm always on the go just now. Like a double penalty, almost. I feel like I never see my children and I'm always behind at work. Give less time to work. It's not my business, but you're off the mark. Only work counts. Sylvie, can we not have this conversation? I'd just as soon avoid it too, please. "Double penalty." Look at the life you lead: Money, flat, work, and the children come last. If you're not happy you shouldn't have had them. You're like all the others, you just want to want. I had dreams, but I brought up Paul. What are you giving them? That sort of cut-price mother? That Louise. I tell you, that woman is worrying. Stop it! - I dreamt of a revolution. - You were a naïve young thing. Naïve, maybe, but not stupid! What's up? Thinking about the flat. It's like a rabbit hutch. Actually, it's Louise. I've had enough. Really? That victim face of hers stresses me out. She's gloomy, and it gets me down. I didn't dare say anything. We should let her go. Not just because she gets you down! It's not only that. I worry about Mila. She's with her more than us and she's picking up her values. It's because of what your mum said. - No, that's not it. - Yes it is. Really not. We must sleep. Nature gives you nightmares. Welcome home She tidied up while we were away! She's amazing. Five euros for two eggs? If they're extra fresh, okay. I love those two children so much, I want to feed them well. Chicken. Sorry, but is it fresh? Because I only... It's very much fresh! Very much fresh? What does it weigh? It's... 200 grams. 200 g? Very well. I'll take your roast chicken. Mind if I use this basket? No, go ahead. That will be perfect. But... what vegetables shall I do? Broccoli? I've got 6 g of broccoli. 6 g of broccoli for me. Six trees. Shall I cook it in water, or fry it with some garlic? In water, Madame. Do you have any garlic? Oh dear, I need a wee. May I use your toilets? Of course. They're just there. But I want to use that toilet. Here you are. Thank you, Madame. Very kind. Ah, that's good! I needed that! Finished. - May I have some paper, please? - Of course. Thank you so much. Your housekeeping leaves much to be desired! - Here you are. - You're very kind, Madame. That's better. Here you are. Madame? Yes? I'd like to finish my shopping, now. I don't want to play. It isn't a game. It's scandalous! I'll never set foot here again. Oh, I frightened you darling, I'm sorry! I'd never go away, you know. I wouldn't have left. Is it loud enough? It's okay. Don't you like it? Yes... There. That's what I did today. - Don't you like it? - Yes. It's great. Mummy, Louise did a wee in the potty. Nonsense. - Mila. - What? Stop talking rubbish. But it's true! Mila, go to bed now. Go on, darling. - Who's to read you a story? - Mummy. Coming. Shall I make coffee? You look tired. I was a hotel receptionist in Essaouira and I'm a trained beautician. A client came and asked me for massages. I went to his room and massaged him and all... One day, he started asking for more, you know? I did more, and more, then he brought me to Paris. A woman took me in, very kind, she signed me up on a dating site for Arabic women and a man contacted me. He thought I was very beautiful, really. He took me home but first he tried to rape me but I calmed him down. Then Youssef offered to marry me if I gave him 20,000 euros! 20,000 euros! To get my papers, it's not much. - 20,000 euros! - Really not. Look, there. Look! See what he's doing? Good boy! Well done! I'm proud of you! Louise, we got a letter which puts us in a difficult position. We're very annoyed. The tax authorities, asking us to deduct from your wages the money you owe them. You haven't answered their reminders for months. I realise it's humiliating for you but it's not nice for us, either. This is the letter. What? It's two lines! Calm down. It's not up to us to declare it! I'm really sorry. Myriam, I... Honestly, I promise, I'll... I'll sort it out. He'll soon calm down. It's because... Since my husband died, things are... I'll help you, Louise. They won't give up. No, Louise. Bring me all the paperwork and I'll see what I can do. I wasn't on his documents. And so my husband's family, they... I wasn't allowed to keep my daughter. May I go? Of course. What you looking at? She won't be back. Nannies do just leave like that. I've heard of it happening. If she's hurt every time there's a problem... She's our employee, not a friend. There are basic rules. She works far more hours than we pay! You're the lawyer! She could say we exploit her. She'd never do that! Right. When my album's finished we'll look elsewhere. She's never stopped working! She's done nothing wrong! The children dote on her! She's given us our life back. And it's difficult just to stop. - She has our keys... - We can do what we want! I really have to go. Go on, then. Kiss. ...your request for a place in a crèche... ...the council has deliberated... ...your application has been selected. Wasn't that enough? Here, eat this. Do you want to eat or not, cheeky boy? Do you want me to tell you a very lovely story? Not a story you'll find in any book. On the contrary. It's the story of a princess who is very, very beautiful. But the princess was dirty. Very, very dirty. So dirty, believe it or not, you couldn't see her body. All you could see were her eyes. Eyes... that were somewhere between blue and green, see? Her kingdom was a filthy quagmire in an abandoned forest. Her castle is a hut built of mud, and when it rains her hut melts. One day, she comes face to face with an explorer who's come from town. Bob the explorer. And Bob thinks this slatternly princess is no doubt very unhappy. He doesn't realise that in fact she's very happy. Extremely happy. With all her friends. In the forest... Are you asleep? Evening. Louise. See you tomorrow. She left it there for revenge. Unbelievable. She's sick! It's scraped clean, washed... It disgusts me. Calm down. Paul, that chicken was in the bin! I heard what you said. This is different. Calm down. This is the final straw. It must mean we should clear our plates. Try to sleep, I'll talk to her. At the end of the week, okay? ...an unprecedented anti-terrorist exercise in Paris after a new intervention plan was presented. Hands on heads! 19 terrorists came into the station... Move and I'll shoot! All right? Louise? What's up, sweetheart? Coming to the park? The children will get bored at home. You can talk to me. I'm your friend, you know. What is it? Alphonse! That'll be 10.50, please. Thank you. Have a nice evening. Children, come here. Time for a bath. Mila! Are you coming? THE PERFECT NANNY
