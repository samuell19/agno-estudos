Some of his nails are broken. l've seen that condition before in dogs... ...who have been locked in cages for months at a time. Devon? You know when l see that? l see that when a dog has been beaten by his owner. That's why he's pissed off. He's pissed off at the world. Okay. Devon. Let's give you a bath. Read these. "This is a tireless. high-energy breed." Tell me about it. "Without meaningful work. border collies will become bored and depressed... ...and may develop behavior problems." Join the club.

You ready? Yeah. Devon. Iook who's Look who's here to see you. It's Emma. Stand still now. He - He's afraid of people. He's weird. Devon. What's he doing? He's herding you. - Why would he wanna hurt me? - No. no. Herding you. He thinks almost anything that moves is a sheep. That's his instinct. That's very interesting. Dad. Look at him. He's so good. huh? What do you think? l have no idea what to think. Jules? Stanley? Hey. Hey. Jules. Hey. Stanley? Hey. buddy. What's the matter? Dad? Something's wrong with Stanley. Stanley is lagging. it turns out. because his heart rate is way down. lt's far below what it should be. ln fact. he may have already had a small stroke. And the x-rays confirm severe hip dysplasia. That's common in Labs. lt's become painful for Stanley to run or walk. l'm surprised he can chase that blue ball. But it's the decline in heart rate that's the most alarming. lt's probable his heart will give out soon. Does Devon have anything to do with this? Oh. God. no. No. This would've happened anyway. You're gonna have to decide what you're willing to put Stanley through. Stan? Stan. it's your blue ball. lt's your favorite. Oh. Stan. l love you. My sweet guy. - Dad. Please don't sing that song. - What? That's their favorite song. Dad. it's so corny. Everywhere but on the paper. huh? Oh. God. See you tomorrow now. Okay. Hey. Dad. Oh. you're still up. What? What? What's going on. Dad? Are you doing any writing? l've been. you know. journaling. You're paying more attention to the dog than to your work. l'm not getting rid of him. l'm gonna check on the dog. Mom asked me to come here... ...because we are worried about you. Emmy. Emmy. Emmy. Emmy. l miss you. Em. l know that. l miss you... ...both. Okay? He's gone. Okay. Are you ready? Are you sure about this? Maybe l should stay. l'm okay. Are you okay? Yeah? All right. Don't miss your classes now. Don't worry about me. - Are you sure? - l'm good. l'm good. Go. go. Come on. Bye. Let's go for a walk. Devon. Oh. my God. Devon! Devon! Devon! Devon! No! Devon! No! No! Come here. Come here. come here. Go. go. go! Go. go! Goddamn you! My God. l hate you. you bastard! We're finished! Don't you understand? lf you don't change. you can't live here. So you don't think your roommates are gonna mind? Julius is a great dog. you know that. Dad, tell me what's going on. Why do l have to take Julius? Look. Devon. he's down in the basement. He can't come upstairs. l gotta lock him in. - He hates that. - Dad? Em. everything's gonna be fine. l just don't want anything else bad to happen. What does that mean? Em. the other line's ringing. l gotta take this. Hold on now. Dad - Yeah? - Good news, Jon. lt turns out the house is available. It's a perfect place to write. Great. Wonderful. Yeah. - Yeah. l wanna see it right away. - Now?

Been on the market for three years. The owners are definitely willing to rent... ...if you understand that it's an as-is situation. Now. the rent is low and the owners are elderly... ...and live in Florida. So they're not gonna be able to come up here... - ...and do any small repairs. - That's okay. This isn't gonna be permanent. Will they rent month-to-month? l think they'd be happy to see any money come from this place. Oh. down there is Bedlam Corners. We can drive down there. l can introduce you to a few people. if you like. Oh. no. l don't wanna meet anyone. You can't get a cell-phone signal on the mountain. Oh. thank God. And there's no phone service to the house... ...but l can call the phone company for you. No. not necessary. l don't want a phone in the house. Hey. stay in here now. Sure is good to see someone in the Matthews' farm again. Coffee? - Okay. Thank you. - Help yourself. You can see my farm from your window. Oh. yeah. The whole town can see your farm up on that hill. You can see everything? Yeah. we don't miss anything around here. What kind of work do you do? l don't know what l do. Aren't you the man with that dog? Yes. l'm the dog man. Thank you.
