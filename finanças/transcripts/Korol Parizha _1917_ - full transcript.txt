"That is the Duke of Dornstein. Strange man. He changed his royal name for the common name of Hienard, he refused money from his mother and became a sculptor." "You villains ... thieves ...

"Young man, there is no doubt You committed fraud. What led you to do that? " "I need money ..." "I've been watching you for a long time. And if I am not mistaken, there is strength in you.

Let's go, we have nothing to do here." Who are you? "Who am I? The three men knew." Everyone is there." "Are you as powerful? As powerful as someone in our society can be a bold man with a lack of conscience." "You are now a guest of the Countess of Saint-Venkova." "Promise me, Count ..." "Look! Down there ... in that big city where corruption and vulgarity reign, With the cult of gold and women, there you will go to hunt, among wolves, tigers and snakes. Learn to destroy them and use them - or they'll eat you." "Treat women like slaves, and men as enemies, and businessmen as puppets. You will be right, you will be strong and wise, you will become the king of Paris." Half a year has passed. Jean Hi?nard continued to lead the modest life of a sculptor.

"Yes, but he asks me to bring him 150,000 francs as dowry." "Get back to your work and don't think about marriage. Love is nonsense. He's in the world for just one important thing - work."

I'll be obedient, because I came with a great request. It's about money." "You made me happy. Finally you and grandmother can be helpful." "You say about yourself that you are old, Mom, but I know few nice women, who would match you." "You have a badly tied tie." "Great, I entrust my son to you and I will go to my guests." "Take the rose! ... For sailors' orphans." "Oh no, flowers are useless, when they are sold to the poor." Dear Lucienne, this man represents two people. The first is the sculptor Jean Hi?nard, and the second - the Duke of Dornstein. I present both to you."
