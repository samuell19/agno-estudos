Let's give a round of applause for this year's recipient of the Woman of the Year award for the third time in a row, Miss Simone Wellington. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you, Linda. You know, you can choose any life you want as long as you take control and you tell yourself "I can do it." Let me hear you all say that with me. I can do it. I can do it. And yes you can. I would like to announce that my third best-selling motivational program entitled "Don't Quit" has just sold... - twenty million copies digitally. Whoo! Yeah! I'd also like to announce that Wellington Tech has just completed our new Intel processor software chip that will be in every laptop computer across the world in just a short time and that is thanks to my lead programmer Tyra Johnson. Hey, that's my wife. I just wanted to-- Yeah! She invented the program and we could not do any of this without you. Thank you so much, Tyra. And of course the woman who brought Tyra to us, Miss Paige Davis. But I cannot even begin to take all of the credit. Linda, you have been there since day one and I could not have accomplished any of this without you. Thank you. Is my team amazing or what? Yeah! You guys give me two hundred percent every day. So at this time I would like to announce my new President of Sales, Paige Davis. Whoa! You have been my number one salesperson for a year straight and your hard work does not go unnoticed. So thank you for that, Madam President. Baby, are you crying? You okay? No, it's just my allergies kicking in. Baby, you don't-- you don't have allergies. Well I do tonight. So this night is a little bittersweet. Wellington is at the top of its game and I would like to keep it that way, which is why it saddens me to announce that I will be selling Wellington Tech and retiring. Wait, what? What? I want to thank all of you for being so supportive throughout my career but it's time we reach the new level and you all carry on my legacy. My staff, my employees, my colleagues, you will continue the work and Wellington will be the greatest company that it can be. Thank you. And enjoy the evening. It's a party, come on! Dinner is served! Thank you! Good night! - Paige, right? - Hi. Congratulations. Thank you. I'm sorry, have we met? I've seen you around. President of Sales, right? That's big shoes to fill. Yes. And I will do everything in my power to make my team proud. I just think it's so wonderful how our company is quick to give the little guy a chance. Keep up the good work. We love ones like you, so eager to move up. Yes. Well maybe in a few years I'll be a partner. Yes. Wow, what a dreamer. I admire that. I was like you once and now look at me, partner of Wellington Tech in just two months. Wow! Really? In just two months? That's-- that's crazy, huh. I mean, well if that's the case, I should be partner. I didn't know that they were passing out the position. President of Sales is not partner material. And technically, I was brought in at a much higher position than you already, so it's not as crazy as it sounds. So I guess you work for me now. This should be fun. Really. Hey, hey, I'm Tyra. I work on the second floor programming. Alexa Sims, I see you every day on the elevator. I'm a huge fan. - Really? - Yes. - I'm flattered, Nina. - No, I'm Tyra. I work on the second floor programming. I'll see you around, Paige. Oh, Simone. That woman is my hero. Girl, shut up. She didn't even know your name. How could she be your hero? She's only been here two months. I should be your hero. No, you're not my hero. Girl, you're my best friend. That's my hero. I just don't understand how they brought her in here out of nowhere and she's already partner. That woman's the best. They brought her in from the biggest competitor corporation. You should be happy she's on our team. Whatever. She's not even all that. Let's go talk to Simone too. Oh no, no. We-- we're going to the restroom, remember? Oh yeah, right, restroom. Okay, but let's just go fast so that we can come back and talk to Simone too. Okay. ♪♪ It was a good event tonight. I'm so excited. - Wellington Tech. - Ladies. - Hi. - Spectacular evening, isn't it? Yes. I kind of don't want this night to end. You two are my stars. I am so proud of both of you. Paige, so glad that you're finally getting what you deserve. When this company sells, you two ladies are going to be taken care of, let me tell you that. Oh, thank you. But you decided to sell the company. Why now? It's our highest profit year. Why not? I've been doing this my entire life. I'm tired of working so hard. I want to spend time with my husband. Besides, I have a lot of money. - Yes. I'm thinking of buying an island in the Bahamas next year. Ooh. I want to be just like you when I grow up. Me too. And retire with class. Hey, I have an idea. I am giving a farewell speech in San Francisco this weekend. Why don't the two of you join me? All expenses paid. Think of it like a company trip. Leave the husbands at home. It'll be just us girls. What do you think? We'll have the time of our lives. Um, well, we would be honored, Mrs. Wellington. - We can't say no. - No, you really can't. - I'll have Jackie send you the details. - Thank you. - Yes, thank you. Cheers to that. - My pleasure. - She is a rich-- - She's going to pay for everything. --Ass bitch. You're rich... Babe, babe, you're forgetting your lunch. I was in there working hard over the stove. - I love you. - I love you too. Look at this, wearing all my red lipstick. Now what time is this flight taking off? Flight's at 3:00 p.m. You know I can't take your sister with us. This is a work trip. But it's just for the weekend. And this is a great opportunity for her to finally get her mind off losing her job. And she really, really looks up to you. I know, I know, but you know what happened the last time I tried to take her with us somewhere. She embarrassed me in front of the entire family. It was a long time ago. Well, I'm going to miss you, babe. I'm going to miss you too. Then don't leave. Stay with me. - Oh... - I'm just playing. Or I can just go with you. No. You know my boss invited me personally with all the girls. Babe, you can't go this time. You went to three company trips already. This is a great opportunity for you girls to bond and go on a girls trip, right? Yeah, but your sister really isn't one of the girls. Damn. I've done favor after favor for you. You can at least do this one for me. Just go have a good time and make sure you call me when you land so I know you made it safe. Baby, I will, okay? I love you. - You know I can't say no to that face. - Oh. - Okay, okay. I'll take her. Best hubby in the world. I got to be. There's a lot of men out there trying to get my woman. God, I don't want you to go. I don't want you to go. I have to call my assistant's boss first to see if it's okay for me to take her. I can't just show up with a tag-along. - Thank you. - Hm. I knew you'd say yes so I gave her the information. She'll see you at the airport. Can I get a kiss? I emailed your schedule for the weekend so you're all set. Yeah. And if there's nothing else, I'm going to head home and spend the weekend with my husband. I am going to close the deal and I'm going to try to have fun. Perfect. - See you Monday. - Alright. See you Monday. - Hey, hey. - Hey, how are you? - Hey, hey. - Hey lady. You ready to go, old-timer? - Oh, who are you calling "old-timer"? Oh, it's me. I'm just ready as I'll ever be. I really haven't had a chance to tell you how exciting this is. I mean selling the company, that is big! Look how far we've come. Yeah, we did this. Yes, we did. I got to tell you though, I kind of miss the old days. Ooh. You and me in the basement. - Not so much. - No? Linda, you got a lot of good years left in you. I'm getting older. I want to spend some quality time with that hot husband of mine while I still can. As you should. - Prime of my life. - Yes. Alright. - Let's go close the deal. - Yes. And then promise me we're going to try to have a little fun. - A last hurrah? - Yes. - I am all in. - Okay. - See you soon. - Alright.

Simone is not dead. She's probably just asleep. We had a lot to drink last night. Come on, Simone. Simone. What? I think you're right. Simone is dead. - I'm calling 911. - No, no, no, don't, don't Don't do that yet, okay? We-- just-- think about it. It's three African-American women in a hotel room with one of the most richest, most powerful white women dead. Hey, just think about how that'll look. I think Lexy's right. What if somebody killed her and now they are trying to frame us for it? That's life in prison. I can't go to jail, Ty-- Nobody is going to jail. No one is going to jail. We don't even know what happened. She could have had a stroke or a heart attack or something. - Yeah. Yeah, we was popping a lot of pills last night. - Right. Yeah. - And drinking. And she's old. - Mm-Hm. Wait. What about if somebody ran up in here while we were sleeping and killed her or-- or-- or maybe we roughed her up too much and knocked her out by accident? All I'm saying is Simone is dead. Whether she got killed or she OD'ed or the bitch just died of natural causes, how is that going to look if somebody finds out? My God. Why? I didn't do anything to this woman. I didn't kill her. Oh my God, it's the police. The police is here, they're here. They are going to take me. I know it. No, no, no, no. You guys just grab the body.

How is my favorite sister-in-law this morning, huh? - Big sis, you okay? - Yeah. I went to your room. I figured you was in here. We was lit last night. - Yeah. - But what did you all do after I left? Looks like a lot. Actually-- actually you kind of got lost after the party buzz. Remember Ted? Linda's assistant? I stayed with him last night. Wait, Ted? When did you meet Ted? Well, when I bumped into Linda in the lobby, after I bumped into Ted in the bathroom. Wait, how long were you in the lobby before you went to the room? Twenty minutes, but it was instant, it was like love at first sight, Romeo and Juliet, only the black version because I'm black mixed with white because he's white, so now it's like we are mixing and-- - Okay, we get it, Keke. - Keke, where's Ted now? - Why the twenty-one questions? What the hell? Oh, Keke. - Whose foot is that? - Keke, Keke, listen, brace yourself, okay? We're about to tell you something really, really, really bad. Remember when I told you whatever happens between us stays between us? Of course, big sis. Okay. Well, okay, Simone Wellington is-- Is dead! Oh, my gosh! - Oh, my God! - Keke. - Oh, my God. - You're going to draw attention. Oh, my God! I got to call 911. - No, no, no, not yet, not yet. Okay? Relax. - Not yet. - No, no, no, listen. Lexy thought it would look suspicious, you know? White woman dead, black women alive, jail. I ain't going to jail. What are we going to do? Who else knows about this? Of course nobody knows. We just found her this morning. Wait. Keke, you're a genius. She is? Wait, why am I a genius? No one knows she's dead. What the hell are you getting at, Paige? No one has to know she's dead. Like chopping up her body and feeding it to the pigs? No, Keke, that's not what I'm saying. You need to stop playing so many video games. - What are you saying? - What I'm saying is if we contact the police, we don't know what's going to happen. But if we pretend she's still alive, then we can find out what happened and then go to the police with the answers. - You know what? That's a good idea. Yes. Wait a minute. I don't know if that's going to work, you guys. We might go to jail for tampering with evidence and then covering up a murder. Y'all crazy. You know, I'm calling 911. No, no, no. Wait, wait. Lexy. If it was a murder, we don't even know that yet. And I think Paige is onto something. This might just work. Of course it's going to work 'cause I thought of it. Well the only way the idea will really work is if we figure out what her schedule is for the day. What do we need for that? Lexy, you know what? That might work. You're actually brilliant. Wait a second. I came up with the plan and she said something about some schedule and all of a sudden she's brilliant? How does that happen? Because if we have her schedule then we can stick to the plan and we can keep her schedule. Right. No one will get suspicious. - I'm down. Let's do it. Totally agree. - Okay. - Alright. You guys, let's find her phone. I'm sure her assistant sent her schedule to her phone. Great idea. - Alright. - Come on. - Got it. Got it. Alright. Got it? Open it. - Open it. - It's locked. Okay, give it to me. Did it work? Yes. Here we go. 12:00 p.m., meet Linda at the bar and grill. Wait, how are we supposed to convince her partner? - Oh no. We got to cancel. - No, no, no, no. If we cancel, that's going to make us look suspicious. We got to find out what happened to our boss. So how do we do it? First... Okay, okay, okay, wait, we got to get her changed. Wait, y'all just playing, right? One of y'all got to give up your lace front. Well, give her yours. - This was your idea. - Uh-uh. This is cut and shaped to my head. I mean what am I going to wear? Well, one of us has to do it. Hey, what happens in Vegas... Stays in Vegas. But we're in San Francisco. Okay, well, just-- just keep smiling, okay. We'll be okay.

Hey, so you missed your meeting with Miss Wellington at 12:00. Apparently she's at the restaurant waiting-- What? No, I didn't. She rescheduled late last night.

Didn't you have a reservation set for this afternoon as well? You know what? I apologize, it totally slipped my mind. I was trying to reschedule. My apologies. No one called to cancel the reservations. Okay, alright. Thank you so much. See you soon. We have a problem. Wellington is still alive. Mrs. Simone's going to golf with investors at 2:00 p.m. How are we going to do that? I can't golf, you can't golf. We-- we have to go. How the hell are we supposed to do that, Tyra? Simone can't golf. Uh, news flash, Simone is dead. And how are we supposed to convince the investors that she's alive but not talking? I don't know Paige, you were the one with this bright idea. You tell me, huh? - You figure it out. - Oh, no, no, no, no. Don't come for me, Tyra. Don't act like any of this was my fault. You better not talk to me like that. Listen, would you two cut it out? - Listen, we are in public, so act like such. - Okay. Okay, okay. Oh yes, now that was a massage. Look like you needed it. Have a seat, gentlemen. Excuse us. Thank you so much. You know, I thought I made myself specifically clear. Kill Wellington. Very simple. I don't understand. We did everything that you asked us to do. We planted the drugs in the room, gave Simone the lethal dose. We even checked her pulse. Nothing. Then why is she still alive? Mmm-hmm. Let me tell you something. If this company sells, I don't get anything. And as long as Simone is alive, the company will sell. Hmm. I just had a massage. I'm going to calm down.

We're going to find out what happened to Simone and then everything will be back to normal. You guys, what about if we really did kill her? Would you stop it with all that? We don't even know if she was murdered, first of all. Yeah. And second of all, none of us are even capable of killing anybody. - Well, except for maybe Keke. - Not me. Well, you were with us so we won't even get into that. Wait, wait, wait. It's my husband Marques. - Oh, my God. - Answer it. - What do I do? - Answer it. Answer and act normal, Paige. Okay, okay, okay. Hello. Hi, baby. How you doing? Don't "baby" me like it's all good. Marques, why are you yelling at me? You trying to play me like I'm stupid. Well, I'm not stupid, Paige Davis. Wait, what are you talking about? You need to lower your voice, tone and delivery, okay? Ooh, that girl right now. She don't know what you're talking about. She's trying to tell me to lower my voice in my own h-- lower my voice, I ain't going to-- you know what you need to do? You need to explain to me why I wake up in the morning to a video message from you from a strip club. - What's up with that? You don't even like strippers, Paige. - Apparently she do. What are you talking about? I would never go to a strip club. Lies, brother, lies, lies. Let her know-- let her know now. You need to check your phone. You sent me a video message. Go ahead, check it! Wait. Let me give you all these quarters, all these quarters. My guy. Whoo! I wish you were here, big head. I'm doing it for the both of us. Oh my God. Girls, I sent him a video of us at the strip club last night. Damn! Okay, fine, you caught me. Oh shit, she fell! Oh, God. Oh, my god. She fell. - Oh, my toes. - It was an accident. Hurry up, grab her. I'm sorry. I'm gonna call you right back. I'm gonna call you back. Don't you break up, Paige, don't you-- don't you hang up this phone on me. It was accident. Just grab her. Pick her up. Okay, ready? Get my wig. Just grab her arms. Grab her legs. She's killing my wig. Ready? I'm going to get her from the middle. Ready, one, two, three. I got her arms. I got her arms. Girl body! Come on. One, two, three. This is one of my best wigs. Girl, ain't nobody paying attention to your wig. - We are going to San Francisco. - Are we? Yeah. We are going to San Francisco. I got eyes on them right now. Simone's still alive. She is with the same ladies that she was with earlier at lunch. You know we all will get into a lot of trouble for this. I know. I'm sorry. I'm just having a moment... Keke, what's that thing you always say? What happens in Vegas... Stays in Vegas. Okay, come on, we got to go make sure she's okay. Okay. Keke. - Come on, Paige, pull it together. - Okay. Alright, let's go. Guys, take the rope off of her. This? Yeah. Fix her hair. Okay. Right, right. Oh, here they are coming. She's good. - Okay. They are coming. Ready? Okay. Yeah. You guys stay here. Okay. - Hi. You must be Randy Haussmann and Alfred Tanner. - Hi. Such a pleasure to meet you. Simone has told us all about you two. Hope so. We're the two guys who're going to be buying Wellington Tech. Oh, yes. Wonderful. Simone. As punctual as ever. But no golf today? No, she's resting today. Okay, we're going to be playing the silent treatment now, huh, Simone? Well, Alfred and I have parsed this deal over and... one billion dollars. - One billion dollars, oh my! Keke. Oh my God. Focus. - Okay. Oh gosh. A billion dollars. You're right, Simone. She's too smart. We can't lowball this one. Pick it up. Two billion. How does that sound? Wonderful. Gentlemen, let's go this way. Let's go, shall we? Hi. My name is Paige Davis. How are you? Yes. Okay. Well, I am the president of sales and-- Tyra, Tyra, yeah. - Tyra is the head of programming, okay. - Hello. - And Keke over there, she is the head of lab security. Yes. So, what is it that you gentlemen said you were offering? - Yeah. - Well, we're offering enough that, well, quite frankly we'd like to speak directly to Simone. - I mean no offense, ladies. Yeah. I have to tell you this is all-- all a bit strange. We received a call yesterday from Linda, it was, - who said that this deal was-- this meeting was over. Mm-hmm. - And then we got a call today that said it was back on. - Oh. - And as I said, I'd really like to speak to Simone. - No, no. - You see, Simone is-- - Mediating. - Mediating. Yeah, because-- - Right. What happened is that Simone is in a deep stage of meditation right now and she said that-- that I could speak for her. Oh boy. Well, we know when Simone doesn't talk that she means business. - You know her very well. - Exactly. We do? - I'll tell you what, let's not do this here. - Okay. Uh, how about dinner tonight at eight right after the conference? - You know what? Let me just check her schedule. Yeah. Simone, pass me the phone. What's that? Uh-huh. Yeah. Eight o'clock sounds great. - Simone would like to talk to you. - Okay. One sec. Okay. Okay, oh. What? You said what? No? - What's she saying? - Hey, I do whatever you say. You know, you're the boss. You're the boss lady. Um, yeah, Simone says that if you do a whole full business proposal by tonight, bam, you've got a deal. Mm-hmm. Well, yeah, I guess - eight o'clock will work. Great. - Okay, yeah, fantastic. Wonderful. Sorry to bother you, Simone. See you tonight? Okay, see you later. Okay. Yeah. Bye. Thank you, guys. Simone said don't be late. - She did? - Yeah. Right, Simone? - See, I heard it. Bye. See you. Thank you. See you tonight. Bye. So I guess we can mark Alfred and Randy off the list because they can't be suspects. They wouldn't offer that much money if they were going to kill her. Right. You're right about that, Lexy. We don't have a lot of time to figure this out. Well, now start looking for clues, you know, maybe things that are, you know, put out of place or something, I don't know. Maybe we can go back to the hotel and find something that was missing. - Good idea. - Right. Don't hotels have security cameras? Right. So, all we need to do is look at the hallway footage. This is a lot, seriously. I don't even know how we're going to do this. Alright. Good job on the security uniform. I got the security schedule from Greg. Okay. How'd you manage to do that, Lex? I have my ways. But listen, we got about thirty minutes before the lunch break is over. Within that thirty minutes no one is guarding the security room, okay? But it's not easy to get in to. Okay. Okay. I already got this. I've already checked out the hotel, I know the system. It doesn't seem like it's going to be that hard to crack. Perfect. Then you know what to do as soon as you get in the main security room. I'm going to go speak to the staff, see what I can get from them. Paige, you stay here with Simone. No, no, no, wait a minute. Why do I have to stay here and babysit Simone? Why can't Keke do it? Why can't I just go with Tyra? No offense, Paige, but you just don't seem like the security type. - Why not? - You're just not security material. That's all. Okay look, Paige, if you want to, you and I can switch. - Okay. - All you have to do is hack into the system. Okay. You have to steal the footage in the mainframe, reprogram the system and then wipe the hard drive so it looks like we were never there. It's easy. Yeah, yeah. Okay, I think you're right, I'm going to stay here with Simone. What I'm doing? - You're going to be on lookout. - Once Tyra gets inside and does her thing, you're going to watch the door. But what if I got to pee and then somebody comes to the door? Okay. Okay, Keke, remember when you told me about your big moment in life? Like being a superhero one day and saving the world? Yeah, exactly. Just like that. Well, this is that moment. That's not saving the world. I'm not like disarming a bomb that's supposed to go off and kill a bunch of people like in the movies. Okay, Keke. Okay, Keke, um, that's never going to happen, okay? So, I need you to think smaller. Think small. Small? Can you do that for me Keke, please? I could do that, big sis. Okay, good. So, all we need you to do is stay and watch. I got you. Alright, great. Everybody know what they need to do? Good. We got less than two hours before Simone's speech. Let's go. I'll be right back. Okay, so. Okay. Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Hold on. Oh, oh... Girl, what was that? You're going to hurt yourself. Too late. I didn't do that since high school. Okay, give me the keypad. Here. Perfect! Alright, we got twenty minutes before lunch is over. All I need is ten. - If anyone comes, you know what to do, right? - Yeah. Whodohoo! Girl. Mm-hmm. It's about to be lit tonight. Wait, this is ridiculous. What the hell do I look like talking to my dead boss? Wait, no, no, no. You know what? I really wish things would have been different but, hey, at least we have one-- at least we had one hell of a night. You know what I'm saying? A night to die for. You got it? Y'all don't know how to knock? You scared the hell out of me. Oh... - Paige, what are you doing here? With the body, what are you doing? What does it look like I'm doing? I'm doing her makeup for tonight's speech. Wait, did you get the footage? Yeah, it's right here. We got it. Get it in. Can you fast-forward? Wait, right there, right there. Zoom in. Two guys coming out of the room. Two guys. We need to figure out who these two guys are and turn them in to the police. Yeah. Who would want to kill Simone? Probably someone who didn't want the company to sell because they'd get cut out of the deal, like Lexy. No offense, Lexy. What? I watch "True Crime" on the ID channel. Besides Lexy, who wouldn't want the company to sell? Can we just keep my name out of it please? Right. Lexy couldn't kill a fly. Thank you. Then who? Linda. Linda's the only one that stands to lose something if the company sells to investors. I mean who knows what's going to happen if the company sells. Linda could lose her position like that. I mean I could too but I'm not as old as Linda is and I don't have that much invested. Technically you guys can lose your jobs too but that's not the point. The point is if Simone dies before the company sells, Linda inherits everything. Keke, you're a genius. I am? Yep, I am a genius. Oh my God, guys. Oh, my God. Linda must have had Simone killed before the company got sold. We kind of just figured that out, Paige. Right, right. And now we're going to take the fall for it. So, what we're going to do now, ladies? As long as they think Simone's alive, we're in danger. But if we let them know she's dead, then we could take the fall for it. Yeah, but we don't know who these two guys are and we don't even know if they're still here. You know, we should all go to the event as planned and just support Simone and act like nothing's wrong. Didn't y'all say Simone got a speech tonight? Don't worry about that. Keke, I have an idea. Okay, so I need you to stay in this room with Simone and under no circumstance allow anyone to come in this room. Can you do that? You already know I got you. Thank you, Keke. I'm really glad you came. Little sis. I'm glad I came too, big sis. Aw. Where in the hell are they? I can smell her. I know she's in here. I smell the cocoa butter and smell that Chanel No. 5. I know she's in there. They're here all upon that home wrecker. All upon and I mean Saturday night special all upon. I mean Beyoncé-- Wait, no. You're here for me. My bad, brother. You know, I'm sorry. I can't right now. Get out of my face... Hi, how are you doing? I'm looking for my wife, Paige Davis. Could you please give me the information to her room? Sir, I do apologize but we can't give information on our guests. You don't understand. I'm her husband. We've-- we've traveled far to get here. Man, that's probably like an hour. It wasn't really that long. Not like that. I understand, but we can't give information on our guests. You don't understand. I need you to get my wife, Paige Davis. I'm her husband Marques Davis. You don't know who you're messing with. Somebody in here is going to catch a body! Whoo! I'm just saying, woman. Listen sir, I'm going to have to ask you to leave or I will have security escort you. Whoa, whoa, whoa, no, no, no. Oh, you don't know me. - We don't know. He don't know you. He don't know you. Sh. - I don't care who you are. I'm sorry, what did you say your name was? Samantha. And I'm going to need you to get your boy. - Oh, oh. - Sh! He's fine. It's just been a really long day. You have to understand like we came all the way down here to surprise his wife for their anniversary and to be honest, we've-- we've just got the runaround. So, if you could just help us find Paige Davis, that'd really be awesome. - Really. Hold on, give me a second. Mr. Johnson, can you please come to the front desk? What can I help you with? This gentleman says he's Mrs. Davis's husband. - Hi sir, you're Mrs. Davis's husband? - Yes, I am. Okay. Can I see some identification please? Thank you. And who's she a guest of? Mrs. Wellington. It does look like he's the husband. But we have a banquet going on, correct? Yes, we do. Sir, we currently have a banquet going on in the east villas and I do believe she's there. So, what I can do for you, I don't normally do this, but if you want to take a seat in the lobby, once it's done I'll give her a call and have her come out. - Thank you. - Sound good? Yes. - I appreciate you. - All right. Great. You're the man. The lobby is right over here, gentlemen. Oh no, we just got to go to the car and-- - Real quick. - Get something out of it real quick. But we're going to come right back and-- - Okay. - Thank you Mr. Johnson. Appreciate it. - You got it. - What do you mean we got it? - I'm just kidding. Since I am partner now, I think we should work together. I think we make a great team. Do you not agree? You just have nothing to say? You got to believe it. Let me just cut to the chase. I want in. Twenty-five percent or I sing like a pop star. Sit down, get comfortable. Let me pour you some wine. Come on. Come on. - Okay. I like you, Lexy. I've always liked you. And I like your style. Thank you. But in this instance I don't think I know what you're talking about. You know exactly what I'm talking about. If Simone sells this company being sole owner of Wellington Tech, she retires a billionaire. But you, you, the woman who built this company, walks away with nothing. Still having to work for new bosses. That's if they decide to keep you on. Come on, Linda. We want the same thing. Simone dead. And what do I need you for again? Because I'm getting the feeling that you think I can't handle this on my own. Well apparently not because I know your first attempt to kill Simone didn't work because she's still alive. And the two guys you hired, they're ready to talk. You also have three other witnesses who can't wait to turn you in. - What do you want? - Like I said, twenty-five percent. I kill Simone for real this time, make sure it's done right. You get your guys to look like it's them, I get my girls to develop a serious case of amnesia. Twenty percent. Lucky and Dino will take the hit. And you and your friends can be very rich women. One more thing. Tyra and Paige keep their position in the company. Do we have a deal? Lexy, we're partners. And around here we toast. He said it's on the inside. - Yeah, inside. Party got to be here. Come on. No. They can't stop me. You can't stop me. Right there, boom. What's going on? Are they having a party? I know they are having a party. That's right baby, I'm coming for you, baby. Man, don't do that. - What's happening? Bro! - I don't know. I'm scared. I'm-- I'm scared. I can't. I got you. Marques, I'm stuck. Oh, I'm stuck. - You okay? Come on. - Help me out. Man, you -- let's go find our wives, bro. That's right. 'Cause she got some explaining to do. Your wife being with her got some explaining to do. You got me jumping. - I'm not that, nigga. I told her I want that nigga. Get there, bitch. Stop. Where are you going? Excuse me sir, my wife is in there. My wife-- my wife is in there. - Are you guys on the list tonight? - I'm on the list. We're on the list. That's right, we are on the list. Davis. - Look at that. - What's your first name, sir? Marques. Sorry brother, I don't see you on the list anywhere. So, unfortunately, I'm not going to be able to let you in tonight. I'm sick of this, man! I'm going to shut this shit down. You're not going to keep me from my wife, man. You're not going to keep me from my partner, brother. My wife is the president and I am the first man which-- anyway, she will care how you're treating me out here and that's not-- Look bro, I don't care who your wife is or isn't. I'm overworked, I'm underpaid, I make a minimum wage here. So, forgive me if I'm not as nice as you'd like me to be. - Okay. - Now take your midget homie right here-- Oh, I'm not his boy. Call me no midget. - Boy, you got a problem? - No, you just got some dust on your shoulder, I was just-- - I think we're good. You're too tall for that, brother. You're wasting your life. Yeah, that, yeah. That's a big ass. You should play some football. Thank you, thank you. Good evening, everyone, and welcome to the sixteenth annual Wellington Tech Conference of America. I'm so happy you could make it tonight. I know you're all expecting to hear from Simone this evening but unfortunately she had an accident and she will not be joining us. Oh... - But don't worry. Here speaking on Simone's behalf, I have the President of Sales, Miss Paige Davis. Alright. Okay. Hi. What is technology? Um... Simone Willington wanted me to tell you guys that she-- um, that she-- she's-- I-- - Read this. - Okay. Okay. She wanted me to read you guys this so here I go. Um... "I cannot even begin to take credit for this incredible company. My business partner, Linda, you have been there by my side since day one. I couldn't have accomplished this without you. And my team, my amazing team, you guys give a hundred and ten percent every day. So, at this time I'd like to announce the new President of Sales, Mrs. Paige Davis. That's me. I'm Paige Davis. Okay. Simone is a visionary, a woman of many talents, someone we can all learn from. No matter how hard we try to stay alive, sometimes we die. Yeah! But that's just the circle of life. You know? Okay. Well, we all know Simone's slogan, "I can do it." Come on guys, say it "I can do it." "I can do it." "I can do it." Yes, you can! Yes, you can. Yes we can. Oh, my God. You can only imagine the pain she felt when she knew she couldn't make it. But when she asked me, the new President of Sales, to do it, guess what I said. - "Yes, I can." Whoo! - Can everyone say "Yes, I can"? Yes, I can! - Yes, I can. Yes. Yes, okay. Yes, you can. Goals are meant to be set and records are meant to be broken. So, when you tell yourself "I can do it" you damn well better believe you can. Yeah. - Yeah! Paige? What's Paige doing? She got stage fright. She ain't got it tonight. Do you dare to dream? Where are my dreamers at tonight? Yeah. - Come on. Don't be shy. Where are my dreamers at? I see you. Yes. I know right there. You know what? Martin had a dream. Kendrick had a dream. And I have a dream. So, we can all dream together. Let's dream. We can all have a dream. As long as it ain't a wet dream. What? Man, are you-- you're always talking so much, you say so much, you got a nasty mind-- Can I hear you say "I can dream"? - I can dream. I can dream, yes! I can dream. I can dream. I can dream. I can dream. I can dream. I can dream. So, to all the dreamers here tonight and to all the little people like me that didn't have anything growing up and the only thing they had was their dream, never give up. - Never give up no matter what anybody tells you. Yes. - Believe in yourself. Yes. - Believe in your dreams. There you go. Because one day they'll become true. Yeah. Alright. Yeah. Yeah! Thank you. Goodnight. - How did I do? - You did good. I did good? - I like that girl. - I see why Simone picked her. So, what do you say I fire up the jet later on? I'm sitting here wondering why this isn't done. We'll get it done. Perfect. It was good. I must admit I was impressed. What was that? Gentlemen, come right in, you're right on time. Let's get down to business. All right. Simone, you remember Lucky, Dino? Lexy? Yeah. - You know these guys? Yeah, you remember? These are the two guys I was telling you about from earlier. Lexy, the only two guys that you told us about was the guys who killed Simon-- Oh! Those guys-- - I'm kind of scared now. I'm-- - What? Get it together! Where's Linda? Like, where is she at? Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on, wait a minute, guys. Put your guns down, okay? They don't know anything. My girls don't know anything. - Get in there! - Yeah, yeah. - And I got his back. - Whoo! Marques, you shouldn't be here. - Be here? I know-- oh so you-- you rocking with the white boy? No, no. - You doing the swirl? - No. You're swirling here. You got my sister here. That's what we are, we are swirling? Get over there. We got college degrees. We ain't messing with that. We've got college degrees. Someone please tell me what the hell is going on here. I'll tell you what's going on here. About a billion of my dollars that I'll never get to see if Simone sells this company. The new owners aren't going to give a damn about what I helped build. The women power that Simone and I always talked about, they're just going to get rid of the company to some old bore guys and there goes my future as well. And why are you not dead? Lexy, I thought that you were going to take care of this. Well, Simone isn't that easy to kill, especially with these idiots with her the entire time. Teddy Bear, what are you doing here? He's with me. What is she talking about? We had sex. You said it was sweet like brown sugar. Okay, that's too much information. Now, Lucky, this is how it's going to go down. I guess if you want something done, you got to do it yourself, huh, Lexy? Listen, we can still go through with the plan, alright? You don't have to kill anybody else. Please don't kill us. Please don't kill us. Listen, we are not going to tell anybody. We promise. We didn't see anything, right y'all? I didn't see anything. I didn't see. I-- I see nothing, I'm legally blind. You're not going to get away with this. - Oh yeah, says who? Linda, remember the deal. My girls said they didn't see anything. You were here meeting Simone, her killers burst through the door, they tried to rob her, they shot her, - you shot them in self-defense. We're all witnesses. Yes. - You get to walk away scot-free. Yeah, yeah. That's what happened. Okay. That sounds good to me. I think I have a better plan. ♪♪ Get off! - I'm losing blood. I'm losing blood. - What? - I'm losing blood. - Keke, you're not shot. You're not shot. - What do we have here? - Oh! Lexy. You're welcome, Simone. Simone, you're alive? How? Wait, then who is that? That is me too, a fake me. Actually an exact replica. It's a new technology that we use just like a real person, only it doesn't breathe. Top-of-the-line, very expensive but worth every penny. She's just sitting there with my wig. Well, she really had me fooled. - My wig. See, I knew what Linda was planning, so I set her up along with Agent Hopkins here. Agent? That's right, Agent Christine Hopkins, FBI. When we found out that Linda was trying to kill Simone, we set up this whole sting operation. See, Simone always knew she could trust you ladies, along with Lexy, of course. Okay. So, what if things wouldn't have gone as planned, Lexy? What if we would have got shot? Paige and I didn't have a vest. Yeah, that's some bull. I should have definitely gotten a vest. You guys were never in any danger. We had all eyes on you the whole time. Who eyes? I watched the whole thing go down. So, wait a minute, you mean to tell me that my plan wasn't a real plan? That my plan was already part of a planned plan? Wait, what? As crazy as it sounds, yes. But you ladies did good. We got the bad guys and Simone gets to retire as planned. But... not before I offer you the position of CEO at Wellington. What? - Oh, my-- No one deserves it more than you, Paige Davis. Oh, my God. Thank you. Oh, thank you. Simone, thank you so much. Thank you. And Tyra, come here, baby girl. We're going to be developing a new smartphone to compete with Apple with the chip that you created. Someone needs to run that department. Thank you. I appreciate that. You girls are going to do very well. Excuse me. Yes, Simone here. Yeah, Alfred, I'll be right down. I'll meet you in the lobby. It's time to go close this deal. Okay. - You ladies want to come with me? Why are you crying? Yes. Hey. You know, I really had a fun trip. - Yeah. - You know what? We make a great team. Actually, yes, we do. - I'm good. - Where's Keke? Keke, come here. You know, there's an opening at the Bureau. I'd love for you to come and train. I think you'll make a hell of an agent. Secret agent? Like SHIELD? No, more like a regular agent, but yeah. Either way I want it. Count me in. - Good. - Keke. - Well, on that note I'll say goodbye. See you later. - Bye, Lex. Agent Melvin Carter. Nice to meet you, Keke. No way, you're FBI too? I'm sorry, I couldn't tell you. I thought we had something. We did. So, what do you say we get out of here and do a little something again? What do I call you? Well, my name is Melvin but right now why don't you just call me Teddy Bear? Ooh. I'm so sorry I accused you of cheating. Baby, I know you're a good woman. Marques, you're everything I need and I don't ever have to go anywhere else, okay? I love you. Miss CEO. And I love you, Mr. CEO. Tyra. Tyra. Okay, okay Tyra, come here. Keke, come here. Hey, listen. Well, the night is still young, so... why not go have some fun? Okay. Hey, y'all want to do it again all over? As long as we don't kill nobody. What happens in Vegas...
