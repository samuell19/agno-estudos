Someone once told me that the secret to happiness is to be content no matter your situation. My dad didn't wanna be a farmer, but that's what life handed him. He worked hard. Sometimes, that hard work paid off. Sometimes it didn't. But he managed to find happiness in it and he always made time for me. My dad taught me everything he knew about farming. He also taught me everything he knew about baseball. There ya go, watch it all the way in. The greatest game on earth. Give me a fastball. He taught me how to be a great locator with a pitch like Greg Maddox, and how to bring the heat like Roger Clemons. Ooh. Some heat on it. But too many years of his hard work not paying off changed him. I've already worked like 30 hours this week! Nothing seemed to make him happy. If you don't show up one more time you're coming off the team! I mean it! What days do you want me to go... Every single day of your life! And once the drought hit, he needed me on the farm, not on the ball field. But I wasn't gonna set my dreams aside like my dad had. I wanted to play in the Majors. Maybe even find my way into the Hall of Fame one day. No matter what it took, I would fight for the life that I wanted. The life that I knew would make me happy. What is the victim's condition? The victim is in critical condition. Do you have a suspect? Yes. The suspect is also in the hospital and also in critical condition. Can you provide the suspects name, age, and what the charges are for? Well the suspect is a juvenile and we've yet to contact the immediate family, therefore we cannot release the name at this time. However, I can tell you that the individual has been charged with DUI, resisting arrest, reckless driving, and aggravated assault with a motor vehicle. We should have further charges filed after a full investigation. And when will you be releasing more information deputy? As I said, we have a full investigation pending ma'am and as we get more... And the Occonee County Sheriffs Department will make no further comments until we've completed a full investigation. Okay Sheriff, just two more questions if you don't mind holding for just a moment. Sheriff, just a moment of your time! Let's just go back to the truck. What in the heck was that circus out front? I was just answering questions for the media. Apparently the victim's a highly regarded individual in this town. Media? City has a population of 6,000 people and one small local newspaper. Look, I know you just transferred over from Clarke County. But this is my department. This is my investigation. Watkinsville is a small town. The kind of town where everybody knows everybody. We don't have these types of situations down here. Last story involving my department that made the local paper, involved a spooked pony. It got free during the July 4th parade. Sorry. Estimated time of the accident was 10:15 p.m. Why was I not notified of it? I pretty much had it handled all right. I filled out the report and I was just gonna finish it up and wait til the morning. Wait til the morning. I mean, how severe of a situation must there be in Clarke County before you notify your sergeant? With all due respect Sheriff, we handled this kind of situation in Clarke County all the time. You're to have no further comment with anyone outside of my department about this investigation. Am I clear? I thought you were the only one in your department. Exactly. Good morning Doc. Sheriff, Deputy. How's Milton doing? He's stable. Milton had a severe head trauma. Fractured right arm. We are keeping him in a medically induced coma to control the brain swelling. How 'bout Mrs. Davis? She's still in surgery. Broken bones, internal bleeding, some spleen damage. Gonna be a difficult and long road to recovery for that one. Anybody notify Milton's mother? When the patient's transported and it involves an accident, we leave the notifications up to your department. I was afraid of that. I would like a copy of the police report and any crime scene photos when they're available. Here you go. Great, I'll make a copy of these. - Thank you. - Thanks. Thanks Doc. After you. What in the heck is this for? He's a flight risk. Look Sheriff, I'm just following procedure. The kid is in a coma. What, you know him? I grew up with his father. Milton had a very, very bright future ahead of him. You ever wonder why God let's bad things happen to good people? Male: Strike! Hey there he is. You did great today man. I'll catch you around. You played awesome today. Thank you. You wanna go for pizza? Wish I could. But you know my dad's waiting on me. Come on. I'll take ya there. Hop in. It's better than nothing. You win? Yes! Milton! Oh I'm so proud of you! I will put it with your collection. Thanks mom. Dad's been looking for you. Told him you went to the barn 30 minutes ago. Thank you. Milton. Say grace please. Lord, bless this food to our use and us to Thy service, and make us ever mindful of the needs of others. Amen. Amen. Give me some corn please. Did you ask Milton about his game? That would be a big negative. Ted. Well? Milton. We won. They move to the championship next week. I hope that's not gonna get in the way of your work around here. I'll get everything done. I've been picking up your slack a lot lately. No matter what I do, it's never enough. My grades are great! I can't remember the last time I got in trouble. You talk about slacking, why don't you cut me some? Don't you dare sit at my table and get smart with me. What did I tell ya? I should've never let him play baseball in the first place. The kids developing an attitude. His priorities are out of whack. He's forgotten what his responsibilities are to this family and this farm. Baseball is a hobby. It is not a career. Ted. He's still a kid. Besides, he likes it. He loves it. And he's really good at it. Don't steal his joy! He has a chance for a college education somewhere. Well learning the family business is what he should be doing. Good morning and welcome. I'm glad that you decided to worship with us. Today we'll be reading from the book of James chapter one, verse 12. "For such a man has stood the test "and will receive the crown of life. "That the Lord, the righteous judge "should get them in that day." Hey, Milton. Can I get a ride? Let's go. Man you're so blessed. I wish I was born with a God given talent. It's not, it's not all it appears all the time. Things are tough at home right now. For as long as I can remember, I've been listening to this inner voice calling me to pursue baseball. I don't know what's best for me, I don't know what's best for my family. I don't, I don't wanna cause pain to those closest to me, you know? I'm not gonna lie, the selfish part of me wants you to stay. But if I were you I'd get as far away from this hick town as possible. Even if it means we can't hangout any more. If I pursue baseball and fail, yeah, I won't regret that. But I know the one thing I would regret, is not trying. That's a great way to look at it. But don't you forget about our boys back home. You always hear these crazy stories about celebrities and baseball players buying their friends houses and cars and stuff. If I make it I'm buying you both. You serious? Yup. Buy you a house and that bad boy gonna have wheels too baby. All right big shot, I'll take two. Hey. Any chance you can skip 7th period? Not today. What's wrong? Coach scheduled an extra practice. And that's got you irritated? I'm not worried about the practice. And I gotta tell my Dad why I'm missing work. He's already got me doing a million things and I have this to worry about. Hey Mil, you know we're all proud of you right? The whole town is. You're a special kid and God has truly blessed you with talent. Thank you coach. And I tell you this because I need you to stay focused for just a little bit longer. You worked really hard up to this point. Now let's go win our team a state baseball championship all right? Yes sir. It's open. I'm excited about your game tomorrow Milton. I'm gonna do everything in my power to make sure that your father is there too. Yeah, I don't want him going if he doesn't want to go. It's not that your father doesn't wanna go to your game. I know sometimes it must be really hard to understand. Your father is under a tremendous amount of stress. He's working twice as hard for half the return Milton. He's doing everything he can to provide for us and to keep the farm afloat. I understand why he cares about the farm and I get it. I mean, he doesn't even want me to try pursuing baseball. Your father was forced into farming at the age of 12. Ted had no other opportunities. He was never given the choice to pursue other things. This is all he knows Milton. I know. Your father loves you very much. Yeah, he has a funny way of showing it sometimes. You know, it's the same sad story for all of my friends. They finish school, it's off to work in the fields. No one dreams past high school. No one new moves here and no one ever leaves. I believe God has a bigger plan for my life. I know He does. That my son is the real reason your father is so stressed. Good night. I love you. Love you, too. How's it going? Mr. Gravitt, how are you sir? Good. Things looking good? Well, I guess as good as they can me. Listen, I know I owe you some money and I'm doing everything I can do to get it happening, you know. Corn's pretty much wiped out right now, we're just doing everything we can to get back from this drought you know. Yeah I know. It's hard on everybody. Let's just keep praying in service. Yeah. I'm believing in you now. Yes sir. Okay. I appreciate it. It's gonna work out all right okay? Just let me know if you're in trouble. I will, I will. All right. Thank you sir. Check on you later. Sheriff. Time! Time! Coach, don't take me out now. How ya feeling? Doing good. No you're not. Look over at that entrance gate, I want you to see something. You good? Bring it home. Strike three, you're out! Hey Milton! Milton come here! Milton, I'd like to introduce you to Coach Dooley from Mountain University. Congratulations on a great season and bringing your team to its first state championship. Thank you sir. Milton, I've been following you and your team this season. And I must admit, your statistics are some of the best ever recorded in the southeast. Thank you very much. It's a team sport, our whole team was great. I couldn't of done it without 'em. Mountain University recruits at one of the highest levels in collegiate sports. And you're the caliber of player we want representing our team. Here comes his parents now. Now that the season is over, I'd love for you to come visit our campus and check out our program. Yes sir. What can I help you with? Mr. and Mrs. Young, say hello to Coach Dooley. He was just commenting what a great game and a great season your son played. You got one mighty talented ballplayer on your hands. He got any brothers? Mountain University is really interested in having your son attend our college next fall. I'd like to set up a meeting and discuss the details. Well I'm not sure that college is right for our family right now. Ted, just listen. Mountain University offers scholarships and grant programs for kids like Milton. Kids like Milton. I'm not really sure what that implies. Mr. Young, let's be honest. This town is limited at best at what it has to offer it's students after graduation. This is an opportunity of a lifetime. Yeah well, like I said, college isn't for us right now. Thank you. Let's go. Mind if I come in? You know, since you were a little kid your mom and I both knew that you were destined for something great. We always knew that God had big plans for your life. I guess somewhere along the way over time it just, I guess I got resentful. And then I got scared. I had 18 years to prepare for this and I blew it. I just wanna tell you that I'm sorry that I haven't been there more for you, while you're pursuing your dreams. In case you didn't know it, I am so proud of you son. I want you to have this. My Daddy gave it to me and his Daddy gave it to him. Maybe someday you'll have someone to give it to. You serious? Yeah. Milton. Come on, wake up! It's Saturday, you overslept. Market opens in 10 minutes. Your Dad left 45 minutes ago. Don't be late. Then I'll have to hear about it all week. Milton! Milton! Your Father's in the field gathering peaches, get there before him and open the store. Good morning. Thought I would get in here early before Katherine's pies got gone. How ya doing today Earl? Oh mighty fine. Apple or peach? I'll take a peach. That'll be $6 please. All right, there ya go. I read that you signed with Mountain University. That's awesome. My wife wanted me to get your autograph before you go famous. It's really not that big of a deal. Go ahead, come on. Appreciate it. Hey, congrats, that's awesome. Thank you sir. Have a good one. You too. You guys ready? How ya doing? Two, four, six. That'll be $3 please. How ya doing, good. Is that the last pie? Yes. Let me get it. How much are they? $6. Thank you. Appreciate it. Enjoy. Hey hun, how's sales been? Pretty good. Yeah? May I please have a break? Sure. Hey handsome! What are you doing here? I came to kidnap you and take you to lunch. You are so sweet. You know I can't get away right now. My dad is crazy on Saturdays. You leave for college in two weeks! What is the worst your dad can do to you? Besides, he's gotta get used to running the farm without you. Lunch. How 'bout you let me take you to dinner tonight instead? I got you a present. No! Look. Where did you get this? You like it? I love it. Why are you so good to me? You didn't have to do that. So... You know I can't. I made peach cobbler. Uh huh, uh huh. Yes! Woo! If my dad catches us. Don't you dare. No, don't you dare! Give me that! Yeah! You almost poked my eye out! Tell me you're gonna miss me. Just don't forget about us okay? We love you. Let's go. Are you Brad? Who's asking? Milton. Milton Young. I think I'm your new roommate. You must be looking for the baseball dorms. Wrong building. My bad. Hey Milton. Come back man, that was way too easy. I see it's gonna be a long rookie camp for you. What's up man? Chill, how are you? All right. What do you expect from the hick out of Watkinsville? Milton this is Ryan. Ryan this is Milton. Don't worry about him. Come on, get your bag. What's his problem? Ryan's a little salty by nature. To answer your question specifically, it's you. What'd I do? You're a threat freshman. I don't understand. Look, I know you're used to go team, but let's face it, the Yankees ain't drafting a whole team, you know? That bunk right there is yours and the small closet is yours as well. Suit up, practice is in 20 minutes. You can walk with me to the fields. Are you serious? Serious about what? I thought practice started tomorrow? No, practice is today. And listen, so you gotta make both beds since you're a freshman of course. I like my sheets tucked in tight, bottom loose, and my pillow lightly fluffed. And what's mine is mine, and what's yours is also mine. I got this hat right here that you can wear and impress Coach Dooley. Welcome to the team. Welcome to baseball camp. We've got three upcoming freshman players I'd like to introduce. Right fielder from Colquitt county, welcome Scott Snyder. Catcher from Valdosta, welcome Jason Campbell. And from Watkinsville, Georgia, Class AAAAA state MVP, welcome Milton Young! Let's make all these guys welcome and part of the team. Let's get with your coaches, take your position on the field, let's play some baseball! Let's go! Hustle up guys! This kids good. Best I've seen. Yes ma, I got plenty to eat. They got the food plan so we're eating like every hour. How's Dad? Tell him I called. Love you. No cellphones where you're from? I'm talking to you farm boy. I'm surprised you guys even have baseball in Watkinsville. From what I hear you hicks play in cornfields, is that right? Look, we were all heroes in high school. Every last one of us. You see, that doesn't make you any different. In fact, compared to most of us you're just average. So what did you think, you were just gonna stroll right in here and take my starting position? Learn your place rookie or I'll put you there. Look, yeah I'm just grateful for the opportunity. Yeah, you're just thankful for the opportunity. No, that's cool. I'm not just gonna stand here and let some hillbilly bumpkin row in here on a tractor thinking he's gonna start over me. So this pipe dream you have of being the big shot on campus, I'm not gonna allow for it okay! Look, I don't know what your deal is, whatever juice you're on has gone to your head bud. You think I'm using steroids, is that what you're saying? Something's up. You have no idea what you're getting yourself into buddy! You're a joke. I'm a joke? Get off me! Farm boy I will end you. Believe that. Come on man. You haven't been able to make the minimum payment on your current outstanding loans. Yeah, I understand. Why would the state take the risk of extending additional credit to a client who currently can't make the minimum payment? Well without that additional credit how are we supposed to keep the farm going? Without fertilizer and seed we're gonna have to close down in six months. Well this has been a particularly hard two years on our state. Our community in particular has been hit very hard. Many families we have helped for generations are being denied and turned away. Don't they care how hard we've worked and the role we've played in the community? Unfortunately Mrs. Young, the states been forced to make cuts across the board for many programs. A drought is considered an act of God. It's outside of human control. It's nothing personal. Hey Ryan. What's up coach? We're starting Milton tomorrow. No, you're making a mistake. We're starting Milton tomorrow. You're done. Whoa man! Coach, he's all right! Ryan that's enough! I lost the starting job to that kid. I did everything I could okay. How come everything I've ever done is not enough for you Dad? I just wanna be appreciated Dad! Bye. Bye! Guys, Ryan had a lot of anger issues, long before Milton arrived. But what we need to do right now is just have a moment of silence. Take our hats off. Let's get back to practice. Milton, I need to see you a minute. Coach, I hope you know it's not what I wanted. No, no, no, no son. It's your Father. ♪ Amazing grace ♪ ♪ How sweet ♪ ♪ The sound ♪ ♪ That saved ♪ ♪ A wretch ♪ ♪ Like me ♪ ♪ I once was lost ♪ ♪ But now ♪ ♪ I'm found ♪ ♪ Was blind ♪ Called home to bury his father. Didn't have a chance to say a proper goodbye. That's what I mean by terrible things happening to good people. Well, with all due respect Sheriff, this boy committed a heinous crime and I think you need to save your kind words and your prayers for the victim and her family. Am I interrupting? Don't think so. Good. Sheriff, I wanna show you something. At first, correct me if I'm wrong. The preliminary accident investigation shows that the truck entered the ravine head on. Therefore the damage on impact was absorbed at the front, straight on. Paramedics stated that Milton had to be cut from seatbelt. Which means he was wearing his seatbelt at the time of the accident. Now here, due to the improvements in seatbelt safety, thank goodness. We rarely see these types of injuries when the victim's wearing seatbelt. Especially when wearing them properly. What are you saying? It is almost impossible for Milton to sustain this type of blunt force trauma to the head and arm in this accident. Milton did not sustain these injuries from the car accident. It is very likely these injuries were sustained outside the vehicle prior to the truck entering the ravine. Well I'll be. Well. Thank you doctor. Of course. Milton. Hey. Hey! Nurse! Nurse! He's awake! He's awake! Need a hand? Things been overheating all week. Here we go. Looks like a loose radiator hose there. Let's see if she'll turn over. I appreciate it. You need a ride? I'm good, thanks. Have a blessed day. So due to the injuries sustained, Milton has radial nerve palsy. Or wrist drop. Now radial nerve palsy is a neurological condition that causes curved or bent fingers. Curved wrist. Sometimes, in certain cases, it can be corrected with surgery. Often, it is permanent. Now I just want you guys prepared for everything. Milton has one of the more severe cases that I've seen. Now it's just my opinion, but, it's likely Milton will have limited function of his right hand for the rest of his life. That's Milton's pitching arm. For God sakes, we just buried his father. I'm so sorry. Well Milton is aware that he has a severe arm injury that will require extensive rehab and most likely surgery. If you need anything, don't hesitate. I'll see you guys in a bit. Coming out of the coma, I knew nothing would ever be the same. My Dad was gone. But it wasn't just his memory that lingered. His burdens did too. And I felt their weight pressing down on me. I figured we could use the help. I could never take back what happened to Mrs. Davis. And it looked like I would never play ball again. I felt broken and worthless. I had to find a way to keep moving forward. Any luck? I think we're gonna need a new alternator. I don't know. I need to work on it a little more. You've been playing around with it for a couple days now. Milton, you can't take on all the burdens of the farm. You have enough legal trouble of your own. Milton. Here. Take this. What's this? That's everything we have left. I think we owe it to Mr. Gravitt to make good on our debt. How much money is this? It's my secret stash. I kept it hidden from your Father. What were you saving it for? When you were about two years old, your Father took me downtown and we were window shopping. It was our anniversary and he was feeling guilty because he couldn't buy me a nice present. Funny how life gets in the way. Your father must have come close to saving the needed $285 about 10 times over but something more urgent always came up. Can I help you? Just looking. This ain't the kind of place where you pop in just looking. Is Mr. Gravitt in? He is extremely busy. What'd you need to see him for? What'd you need son? You Ted's boy? What kind of business you need to see Mr. Gravitt's for? I know he's busy, just, can you please tell him I need five minutes of his time? Sure son. He's back in the warehouse, you go on back and see him. Thank you. Mr. Gravitt. Milton Young. Ted's son. Yes I, I know. I'm really sorry to hear about your Father. What brings you here? The last few years been really difficult on my family. Last couple of years been extremely tough for the entire community and our nation. Nobody expected the recession or the drought to last this long. I understand my family owes you a lot of money. I wanna make another run on the spring crop season on the farm. I got a plan. I just want you to at least hear me out. Spring seeds should have been sewn two weeks ago. You've practically missed the window. You're a little late son. Because of our crop rotation and limited planting last Fall, our soil hasn't been this fertile in years. It's late, but it's not too late. I commend you on having the courage to come down here and see me and wanting to fight for your families farm. Your father would be proud. I need seed and fertilizer. You want to buy seed and fertilizer? This is everything we have left. How much is this? Almost 200. Son, your family owes me thousands of dollars. This is short. I mean given our current situation we can't repay the debt. I can sit back and do nothing the bank will eventually take over the farm and you'll never get repaid. I want a chance to repay the debt. Give me a chance! I'm not a bank. I am not in the business of lending money. The economy has taken a toll on our business as well. We too are suffering financially. We're in the middle of one of the worst droughts on the record. I'm not in a position to take that additional risk. It's nothing personal. But that would be foolish and a financially reckless business decision on my part. I'm asking you to trust me. Have faith in Pastures of Rose Creek Farm. What about your legal troubles? And what about your arm? Are you able to do any real physical labor? I'm fully prepared to face the consequences of my actions. I know what I gotta do. As far as my arm, the doctor said that I'm perfectly fine to work in the fields. Look, I know you're going through a tough time right now. And again, I say I'm sorry about your Dad. Ted was a good man. Thank you for coming down and make a partial payment on your family's outstanding debt. We're just not in the position to extend additional credit or resources. Thank you. For hearing me out. Good luck Milton. I tried to delay as long as possible. There were no other options. I'm really sorry. Hey, how've you been? I've been trying to call. Did Katherine give you any of my messages? Hello? Why are you... Danielle, what do you want from me? I haven't heard from you in a while, I just wanted to check in on you and make sure you were okay. Look, I heard that you were meeting your attorney tomorrow and I just wanted to know if there was anything that I could do for you? Who told you that? Why are you so upset? Did you also hear the accident was my fault? You know, everything's my fault, I'm a monster? Wait, Milton talk to me. I just can't figure it out. Things aren't going real well on the farm. Things aren't going real well in my personal life. Things aren't going real well anywhere. There's nothing here for you Danielle. Can I help you? I'm here to see Mrs. Davis. She's in room 330. End of the hall on your right. Thanks. How are you Mrs. Davis? It's Milton. Milton Young. I wanted to tell you how sorry I am. I wish I could remember what happened. I wish I could go back and fix it. I wanna make sure you know that I'm sorry. Due to your financial hardship the state has agreed to allow me to represent you as the court appointed attorney. Now the state of Georgia has charged you with aggravated vehicular assault, DUI, and resisting arrest. Because you were 18 at time the charges were filed. The state considers you an adult. These offenses carry a combined 10 years in prison. It doesn't help your case you severely injured a very well respected member of our community. It feels like I'm already guilty? Well, it's my job is to put together a defense and fight the charges against you. Now, the first thing we do is we always try to get the charges dropped if we can find a loophole or technicality. If we can't do that I would then recommend negotiating with the state solicitor to plea down the charges to lesser offenses. Our last option, and the one we want to avoid, is going to trial, fighting the charges in a courtroom in front of a jury. I didn't commit any of these crimes. Okay. Well, why don't you give me your version of the events that transpired on May 6th. That was the day of my Father's funeral. I am so sorry for your loss. If there's anything we can do for you, please let call us. Thank you. Take care. Thank you for coming. When are you going back to college? I can't go back. Not now, there's so much to do here. Milton, your future is at school pursuing your dreams. Can we talk about this later? We have a few guests coming back to the house. I just want to be alone. I'll take a ride if you don't mind. You sure you're okay? Yeah. I need to clear my head. Hey. Hanging in there? Yeah. Look, I'm really sorry about your Dad. I finally got out of town and everything was starting to fall into place. For once, things were going my way. The way I've always dreamed. Now everything is so messed up I can't think straight. Brought you something. What's this? A little something to keep your mind off things. You know I'm not much of a drinker bro. Keep it for later then. Trust me, you'll need it. Catch you around. You told me you weren't drinking. Mom, I was telling... Mrs. Young, I'd like to ask you to refrain from interrupting while I'm trying to get your sons version of the events. Milton, please continue. That's the last thing I remember. The last thing you remember is downing liquor. I wasn't downing liquor, I didn't even swallow. What's the next thing that you remember? Waking up in a hospital a week later. Let me just make sure I've got this right. You took a sip of liquor and then woke up a week later in the hospital? That's a large gap. Resisting arrest. You're right handed? Yes ma'am. Patient suffers from Anterograde amnesia due to blunt force trauma to head and neck. You really don't remember anything else from that night? I mean every now and then I'll have a dream. You know, it's never enough to piece together. I know for certain I did not run over Mrs. Davis. You have to understand, that it's very hard to defend a client when they can't provide any details of the events the night in question. Isn't that your job? This has to be very upsetting Mrs. Young. I know this is scary for a mother. Knowing her son is facing these kinds of charges. I have a police report to review and I have some witnesses I need to talk to. I've still got a lot of research. And I want to assure you that I will do everything in my power to represent your son according to Georgia law. And it's also my job to give advice. And my initial thoughts, this is gonna be an extremely difficult case to defend. Now I'm encouraged by Milton's record. It's clean, no priors. And I expect our best option would be to negotiate to lesser charges to minimize his jail time. You said to always put my trust and faith in our Heavenly Father. He'd lead me in the right direction. I'm so sorry Milton. I finally got out of the town I'd worked hard to escape. Pursuing something that I thought I was called to do. We lost Dad. We're about to lose the farm. I've got legal troubles from an accident I don't even remember, and I'll never play baseball again. Milton. I can't imagine how you feel. Sometimes, things have a strange way of working themselves out. It's not fair. Milton! Milton! What are you doing? Hun. But not my will but yours be done. Can I help you? Saw the sign. Y'all looking for help around the farm. I don't mean you no harm ma'am. I don't recognize you from town. I'm not from around here. Just passing through. Help is no longer needed. Can I help you? I'm David. I spoke with your mother about helping out around the farm. She didn't mention that to me. Good news. It turns out it wasn't the alternator after all. Appears to have been a loose cable. How did you know I thought it was a bad alternator? I told you the position is no longer needed. Get off our property mister. Should we see if she starts? Listen, I appreciate you coming out here, fixing our tractor, but, my mom's right we don't need nobody right now. Last frost was a few weeks back. Corn and melon seeds should of been sown by now. We really need to get work. Look, I don't know who you talk to or what you heard around town, we're in no financial position to be hiring day labor. Run up to the house and grab this man a few dollars and pay him for his time. Mighty kind of you ma'am, but I'm not here for your money. I know your husband passed recently. Milton, I know you lost complete use of your right hand and facing some serious legal issues. I know y'all are in debt and the banks fixing to foreclose on your farm in a few months. Unfortunately, y'all are out of options. You need me. Who sent you? I'll take 15% override on Summers final harvest. I only need one good meal a day. I reckon that barn over yonder will do for sleeping. We're in the middle of the worst drought on record. I mean, I just listed all these problems we're facing, why sneak out here and fix some random persons tractor? You just said it yourself, what good is a running tractor when we ain't got no money? No seed, fertilizer, you know, nothing. Do not worry about tomorrow, tomorrow will worry about itself. Each new day has got enough trouble of its own. Why would anyone risk something like that with such little reward? You don't even know us. I've got something you don't. What would that be? Hope. We got a deal? Got a deal. Thank you for believing in me. I won't let you down. You two are making progress. Well the soil was in great condition. And we've been fortunate too. The equipment's holding up. God is good. Yes He is. All the time. Kinda hard to believe that sometimes. Well, I know what it is to be in need. And I know what it is to have plenty. I've learned the secret to happiness is to be content in every and any situation. It's getting late. I'm gonna turn in for the night. Thank you for the meal, it was wonderful. We have a big day tomorrow. You were awesome. I'm doing my best. Yeah, you're the one who's really helping. Now what? Our work is done for now. Now we wait patiently and listen. Wait for what? You have not been ignored or forgotten. You didn't choose Him, He chose you. David! David! Good evening sir. What ya doing here? I haven't slept since you left the store a few weeks ago. Ma'am. Mr. Gravitt. My wife and I have been thinking about what you said. We've been doing business with your family for over 50 years. Your father was always a man of his word. We thought about what you said and we prayed. We wanna help. You gotta be kidding me. We believe in you. And Pastures of Rose Creek Farm. Oh yeah, yeah. With David's help, I began to believe we would find our way through. Maybe I'd never be happy here, but we could survive. And I could be grateful for that. Maybe being grateful would be enough. I couldn't help but think of my Dad and wonder why that hadn't been enough for him. But my Dad's burdens would have to wait. I had my own. Afternoon Milton. We're here about Mrs. Davis. Is Mrs. Davis okay? Mrs. Davis passed on this morning. I thought she was doing better. Overnight she took a turn for the worse. The DA's upgrading the charges pending against you to vehicular manslaughter. You're under arrest Milton. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in the court of law. You have the right to an attorney, if you can't afford one, one will be provided for you at no cost. You understand these rights as I've explained 'em to you? Yes sir. All right, let's go bro. Come on. We're right here. Turn around. Watch your head. Place your left hand on the monitor, fingers together. Hold it. It's okay Jackie, Rachel will be fine. Visiting an inmate? Yes sir. Do you have an appointment? No sir. Who are you here to see? Milton Young. We really recommend making appointments in advance. My apologies. First time visitor. You have any weapons or sharp objects on you? No sir. Relationship to the inmate? Friend. Yeah, I need you to fill out this visitor information on top and I need a form of government issued ID. How ya holding up? Hanging in there. How's Mom doing? She's doing all right. They say anything about your court date? My attorney said she needs more time. Heard the news this morning. Rainfall's up eight inches for the year. Some saying possible bumper crops though. At least that's good. Off to a good start. Excuse me. Hey! I brought you something. Driver, place your hands outside the vehicle. Let me see your license son. You stay right here. Milton Young. Milton Young. Come on, get out of the truck. Put your hands on the vehicle. Was I doing something wrong sir? We're gonna find out. What's this about? I'm gonna place you in handcuffs son. For your safety and for mine when I inspect your vehicle, okay. Oh, oh, oh, look at what we got here. Mm, mm, mm. Pretty young to be drinking ain't you son? Looks like I'm gonna have to add driving under the influence on alcohol huh? I didn't drink it! Hey! Don't you resist! Hey, you play fall ball, hm? Yes sir. Coach Dooley? Yes sir. Come for my Dad's funeral. I'm sorry to hear that. So you're the hot shot huh? I'm not sure what you mean. Oh no? You killed my son. I didn't kill anybody. You killed my son! Come on, get up. I ain't through with you yet. Come on, get up. We gonna take a little joyride boy. Huh? One more, one more time! Come on boy! Here we go! Woo! Woo! What have you done? It's your fault! You made me do this! You made me do it! Come on, we gotta get this door open! Let's go! Door open now! We have a visitor unaccounted for. Where'd he go? The guy sitting right here, where did he go? I gotta see Sheriff Darden. Where is he? Where is the other guy! Get Sheriff, I know what happened the night of the accident. Okay, I don't have time for this game. Let's go! I didn't kill Mrs. Davis. Relax! What in the heck is going on? I'm not sure Sheriff. What do you mean "not sure." All the inmates are accounted for. Who ordered the lockdown? We lost power in the main jail, the backup generators failed. What was the cause? Appears to have started in the visitor area. Was anybody in there at the time? Milton and a visitor. Several lights exploded and there was a small electrical fire that broke out as well. Get the surveillance video. I'm trying to get that up now sir. Milton. Where did your little friend magically disappear to? Sheriff I know what happened the night of the accident. I was not driving the truck when Mrs. Davis got ran over. Are you feeling okay? I wasn't drinking alcohol either. I was set up. Who set you up? Deputy Jones killed Mrs. Davis. Deputy Jones set you up? He stopped me in the park the day of my Fathers funeral. He told me I killed his son Ryan. Deputy Jones driving your truck. Well after he ran over Mrs. Davis he knocked me unconscious. Look, Milton I know it's been a little exciting around here, but I wanna get you checked out by medical. I'm not just making stuff up trying to get out of here. This is the truth. You gotta believe me. Sure. I believe you. Sheriff. You might wanna take a look at this. What you got? We lost all video on every backup. Something caused a massive electrical surge. What about the front entrance camera? Wait a minute. Rewind, rewind camera two. I think we've been having some problems with that one lately. What about the front front outside camera? Any footage of the visitor leaving? Let's take a look. Camera's working fine. No footage of the visitor exiting. Morning Sheriff. Good morning. Had a little incident down at the jail the other day. Is Milton okay? Yeah, Milton's fine, he's fine. What can you tell me about this drifter named David? We hired him to do some day labor around the farm. Haven't seen him in a couple days. He just kinda does his own thing. Now where does he stay? He stays over there in the barn. Did David do something wrong? No, no I just need to speak with him. Okay if I take a look around? Make yourself at home. All right. What can I do for ya? Doc. I must've gone through this report 100 times. For the life of me I can't put my hands on the toxicology results. I know we put 'em in here. This is strange. I agree. Very strange. It's a simple fix. I'll call down and get another copy. Want me to call you with the results first? Would you do that for me? Absolutely. Thanks Doc. You got it. Have a good day Sheriff, be safe. Sheriff Darden, Dr. Adams on the phone. Yeah, Darden here. Just wanted to let you know I got those results back. Toxicology came back clean. No signs of alcohol or any other controlled substances. Is that right? You sure about that? Yeah, you'll have a copy of the full report by tomorrow. Any other questions, don't hesitate to call. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Yeah, take care Doc, bye. Is everything okay Sheriff? Mm hm. You wanted to meet? Have a seat. Preparation for Milton's trial, we need to review this police report on Milton's accident. Making sure we're ready. Sure. I need our report to be air tight. Well, everything you need is right there. I've double and triple checked it. That's my concern. I've noticed some inconsistencies. In fact, it appears sloppy. Well, likely just a simple oversight. Clear up real quick. Let me see it. Did I forget to fill that in? There's no mention of a sobriety test? Innocent little mistake huh? You saw the liquor bottle in the photos and he smelled like a brewery. I'm gonna ask you one more time. Did you administer a breathalyzer at the time you detained Milton? Well Milton was belligerent. He was combative and then he resisted arrest. And then he fled the scene so I was unable to administer... Milton fled? Yes, he fled the scene in his truck and then he hit Mrs. Davis and then eventually wrecked. All the crime scene corroborates that this is exactly what happened so let me just fill out the report Sheriff and we'll move on okay? If you were unable to administer the proper test in the field, why didn't you ask for blood tests once at the hospital? You know what Sheriff, I don't know what you're driving at, but I got 17 years exemplary service and I'm not about to have some hillbilly country bumpkin question my report and my investigation. How do you expect the prosecution to convict Milton if you cannot prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he was intoxicated? We had samples tested in the lab. Milton's blood alcohol level was 0.00. Milton fled the scene all right. And he killed someone. That's what this is really about. You sure that's how it happened? Milton killed an innocent woman! Is this your son? Milton's responsible for my sons death. Deputy Jones, you're under arrest. Milton's gotta pay for what he did to my son! Leave your weapon on my desk. You can't do this! Place your weapon on the desk! You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to attorney, if you cannot afford one, one will be appointed to you. Deputies! Milton. Lab results came back. You're being released. Immediately. All charges dropped. Thank the Lord. I still wanna talk to your friend. About the little incident here at the jail house. Yes sir. You know the way. Hi! Are you okay? I'm fine. Oh well you look good. Let's get you out of here. So Sheriff Darden stopped by a couple times looking for David, said there was a disturbance at the jail? Yeah, it was like a power surge or something like that. There was a storm. That's strange. I know. David just left, didn't say goodbye? Didn't leave a note? Nothing. All right, let's get you out of here. I've got something to show you! David had tried to show me that the seeds of hope are far more fertile than the seeds of doubt. And staring out at our once barren fields, I had never been more sure that was true. I only wish I had the chance to thank him for all he'd done. And to say goodbye. How ya doing? I'm doing just fine, thank you. You know, I've been coming here since I was a kid. Don't think I've ever seen it this abundant. Yes ma'am. I mean we truly have been blessed. Truly. That'll be $24 please. 45, 46, 47, 48, 49. This is amazing. 52, 53, 54, 55. It's there. It's all there. Are you serious? Enough to cover the tax bill. The seed, the fertilizer. The mortgage? Ma! Katherine! Oh my God! Is everything okay? It's Milton! Is Milton hurt! Come on! Hold on! Leave it, we gotta go! Come on! Surprise! Come on, let's go! My Dad never got to ride in that hot air balloon when he was alive, but up there, a thousand feet in the air, my Mom and I, we felt his presence. Together, we released his burdens. Every one of them. And we never felt so free. God, you scared me? Where have you been? Is everything okay? We've been worried. I'm fine. Just have to tend to a few other things. You didn't say goodbye. Looks like your prayers are answered. Yes they have. I mean, I've never seen anything like this before. I never got to thank you. This was not possible without your help. You're welcome. I was wondering if you ever come back for your money. Keep it, it's your money. No, we had an agreement. I was never here for the money. Why'd you come back? Unfinished business. David once told me that the secret to happiness is to be content, no matter your situation. I don't know if I'll end up working on the farm like my dad did, or playing in the Majors and finding my way into the Hall of Fame. What I do know, is that my life isn't going to make me happy. My happiness is going to make my life.
