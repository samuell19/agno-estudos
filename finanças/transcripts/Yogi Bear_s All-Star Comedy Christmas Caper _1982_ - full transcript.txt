'The last bus load of tourist has gone' 'And Yogi is hibernating.' Three months of peace, quiet and no Yogi. What a Christmas present. (male #2) 'Jelly Stone Park, everybody out.' Ah, the forest primeval, how picturesque. Howdy, Mr. Ranger, sir. I'm Huckleberry Hound. And these here are my friends, Hokey Wolf. Pleased to meet such a fine representative of the forest department. (Huckleberry Hound) 'Quick Draw McGraw and Snagglepuss.' Howdy. And that there is Augie Doggie and his Doggie Daddy. My dear old dad and I are pleased to meet you. Ha ha ha. That's my boy, who said that. Last but not least. The world's greatest detectives, Super Snooper and Blabber Mouse. But-but what are you doing here? The park is closed for the season. Ah, we're here from the Big City. To spend Christmas Eve with our friends, Yogi and Boo-Boo. - But Yogi is hibernating. - Well, come, come, come. Make with the wake up call. Or do I have to call my friend? - The secretary of the interior. - Your-your friend? One word from me. And he'll have you holding the stop sign at deer crossings. - Now announce us. - R-r-right away. You got to keep these park rangers on their tootsies. Now I'm Yogi's receptionist. Sheeh! 'This is Yogi Bear's answering machine.' 'Usually the average bear is hibernating.' 'But I'm notthe average bear.' How true. 'Boo-Boo and I have left for the Big City.' 'To spend Christmas with Huckleberry Hound' 'and the rest of our friends.' - What - 'After the boop, ah, beep.' 'Leave your name and a picnic basket.' Yogi, you can't do that, I.. He's got me so mad, I'm talking to his answering machine. 'They must have stowed away on that last tourist bus.' I'll call the authorities to grab them when they get there. Gosh, we came here to see them and they went to the Big City to see us. I think, Yogi is in big trouble, dear old dad. You're absolutely correct, my brilliant son. We better find Yogi before the Sheriff spots and he catches on. Right and you better believe. Let us exit stage left for the Big City, then. That's right, two bears. Hold them when the bus arrives. I'll be down to pick 'em up as soon as I can. I thought I'd have a nice peaceful Christmas. I forgot Yogi had a whole week left to spoil it for me. [joyful music] Sheeh! What cheap lunches people pack these days. No caviar. No quiche. The ranger isn't gonna like this Yogi. Boo-Boo, my boy. In all the years you've known me. How many times have you said that? Seven thousand eight hundred and sixty seven. And how many times have I gotten us into real trouble. Seven thousand eight hundred and sixty seven. Well, I'm bound to get lucky one of these days. [crunching] (male #3) 'The jelly stone bus is due any second now.' - 'Keep a sharp lookout.' - Right. And don't mention bear, we don't want to stat a panic. Yay! It's the big city. Come on, little buddy. Let's look for our friends. [jolly music] See, what a nice Christmas for them. O-Oh! Look, Yogi. Hold them, hold them right there. What are they doing with that net? I don't think they want to play tennis. Come on, Boo-Boo. Let's vamoose. Hey, they went into the depot. - You go around the front. - Okay. (female announcer) 'Passengers for the 2 o'clock bus to Scranton.' 'Please board at Gate 3.' Yogi, look by the door. 'Fear not, little buddy' we're not spending Christmas in any zoo. Attention please-- We interrupt this announcement to bring you an announcement. There are two bears, loose in the terminal. [screaming] Hold it folks! Oh, save us from the bears. Who knows, what the bears will do? screech Here we are, Judy, the best department store in town. Pick out anything you want for a present. - And charge it to my account. - Daddy, can't you come with me? Delanie, did you get the amalgamated contract. - What, dear? - I said, can't you come? I want you to pick out my present. I'm sorry, honey. But I've business calls to make. Now, run along. [telephone ringing] That's you, Munger? Jones here. About that Canadian shipment. I want to hold it for a few days. Don't be long, Judy. I have a board meeting coming up. There they are, in the toy department. Super-duper Ray Demolisher. 'Be the first kid on your block to level Detroit.' I wonder how this thing of magic works. Keep that gun.. Come on, Yogi. They're going to find us. Okay, little Boo-Boo, I do not wish to be found. (male #4) 'Alright, men, training is over.' Some of you are going to go out there, you're not coming back. You're gonna face running noses, Christmas lists a mile long. 'And worst of all, adolescent beard pulling.' Alright, men. Atten-hut, forward left. (both) Ho ho ho ho! I can't hear you. (all) Ho ho ho ho! That's better. A little too much padding for you. Hey, that's my own personal me, sir. Alright, let's move out. Hut, hut, hut! Oh, Mr. Santa Claus. May I talk to you for just a minute? Let's head back to the zoo. I've had it with this bear patrol. Me too. My daughter is at some place in this store. I demand, you find her at once. Yes, sir. Don't worry I'll find her. Yogi, will we really spend Christmas with Hug and the guys? Sure thing, Boo-Boo. Of course, by the time we find them it maybe memorial day. Santa. Santa. Could I make my wish now? A child of the female variety. Sorry, kiddo. But this Santa is closed. You want to express Santa, ten items or less. I only want one thing more than anything else in the world. Oh, and pray what could that be? A daddy who will spend Christmas with me. Poor little kid hasn't got a daddy. It kinda gets me, right here. Gee, Yogi, she thinks you are Santa. Shouldn't you tell her you're a bear. Not yet, Boo-Boo. Come along with me, you little tike. Santa can't promise you a father but he'll try to make your merry Christmas a little merrier. Oh, neat-o. My name is Judy Jones. That is a lovely name. And it looks like you've found me right in the same knick of time. I found her, she's with some fancy guy dressed in Santa suit. - 'He's not one of our Santas.' - Don't let her get away. Her father's one of the richest men. Roger. I never have anyone to play with at Christmas. Well, you do now. We'll-- - Hey, you, Santa. - You're addressing I, sir? Yeah, you. I want to talk to you. (Boo-Boo) 'Yogi, now the security guards are after us.' They're sure makin' a fuss. Just 'cause we snuck out of Jelly Stone. I told you the ranger wasn't gonna like it. Attention all security personnel. Seal all store exits. [screeching] Sheesh! That looks like they called out the fifth army. Gee, this is fun. They're getting away in that snow mobile. They're not getting away. They're coming at us. Retreat. Hold on. Eeeyaw! Wow! This is the best Christmas I ever had. Yogi, what are we gonna do? I think it's obvious what we're gonna do. We're gonna crash. bang That was neato. Can we do it again? [police siren] The police! Time for our feet to beat a retreat. And the temperature will be in the low 30's. Ah, this's just in. Police are searching for a Santa Claus imposter 'who has disappeared with seven year old Judy Jones.' 'Daughter of billionaire J. Wellington Jones.' 'Police Chief Blake has this to say:' Witnesses describe the suspect as resembling a bear. '5' 7", 210 pounds.' No. No. No, it couldn't be. We'll apprehend this allege bear and put him away for a long time. He couldn't. Yogi just couldn't. But he probably has. 'What a disgustedly situation.' 'We go to Jelly Stone to visit Yogi.' 'And he comes to the big city to visit us.' Don't fret, father of fathers. You and me will find him. But how? There must be a zillion people in that crowd. Aah, searching a lot of them. Huh? What does that mean? Buying the picnic basket and ergo. You found the bear. And I think I know where to find one. 'The big city park ground.' This has been real fun. But I'm getting hungry. Yeah, me too. This is silly, Marie. It's too cold to have a Christmas picnic in the park. Did I hear someone saypicnic? I wanted do this ever since I was a little boy. [screeching] The lady is right, Marie. You should be home stuffing stockings. Instead of catching a cold. See, I told you, Marie. I'll tell you what I'll do for you, sir. I'll have a picnic in the park. And let you know how it was. Thank you, sir. Give him the basket, Marie. A big thank you to you, lady. And a Merry Christmas to you, Marie. What a kind man. Or whatever it was. Gee, this is great, Yogi. Ah, I mean, Santa. 'And the Christmas decorations you, uh...borrowed.' 'Makes it very Christmasy.' Gee, Santa, you're wonderful. I have a confession to make. You see, uh...I'm not... the real Santa Claus. Just, uh... Unreasonable facsimile. Oh, I knew that hours ago. - But you're still Santa to me. - Oh, shaucks. But it's time I took you home. Uh, where do you live? I won't tell you because I don't want to go home. 'I never have this much fun at home.' But you can't stay with us. (Judy) 'Why not?' Well, uh, I'll tell you why not. Uh-h, because, uh.. Yeah, well.. That is, uh.. Boo-Boo, can I see you for a second in my private office. What are we gonna do, Boo-Boo? Her family must be very sick by now. May be we could find her folks in the phone book. She said her name was Jones. Aah, capital suggestion. Ah, let's see now, uh. Jones. Jones, uh...Jones. 'Ah, here we are, Jones.' 'Gosh, Yogi.' 'There must be a million of them in the phone book.' Sheesh, it shouldn't take longer than the rest of our lives to find her family. Give or take a couple of years. [engine sputtering] - Hey! How do you do, Yogi? - Hi, Yogi. - Hi, Boo-Boo. - Merry Christmas. Seasons Greetings. Happy event. Boo-Boo boy, I think we just got some helping hands. Now for the 809th time. Are you gonna tell us where you live? - No! - 'Okay, gang. It's up to us.' Go check your list of Jonesies while I round up some other friends to help. Just leave it to us, Yogi. We're panting to participate. We'll find the little darling's kin folk. And we'll stay and keep an eye on Judy. Right, dad of mine? Right. Apple of his daddy's eye. [indistinct chatter] I've got to find that Yogi Bear. [bells ringing] Heavens to cameo guest stars. 'It's Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble.' Hi, you, Snaglepuss. Aren't you chaps a little far from Bedrock? Like about, uh, three millions years. Barney and I are working here to raise a couple of bucks. We're here to help with a royal order of water buffaloes Christmas party for the kids. I'd be glad to help. But I'm broke. Tapped out even. You can help. Go ask that lady over there for a donation. I'd be overjoyed to. Exit stage left. [speaking french] Would you like to, uh-- [screaming] A lion! Help! - Don't worry, lady. - We'll protect you. [thud] Take this you ferocious lion. Ferocious? I'm timider than a timid pussycat. Shh! Uh, don't make a fuss or I'll call the cops. Oh, thank you so much. And here, let me make a donation to your favorite charity. Well, thank you, ma'am. The kids in Bedrock are gonna have a great Christmas party. Thanks to you, Snaggle. You're very welcome. But can you spare a little for some liniment? Oh, my achin' sacroiliac even. Negative, Quick Draw. Like, uh, nobody named Jones lives here. You sure, Jinks? It's really important. You think it's time to get Jinksy his Christmas present, Pixie? No time like the present for the present, Dixie. (both) Merry Christmas, Mr. Jinks. Like, uh, gosh, fellas. I didn't purchase you guys anything. That's okay. 'And after all these years of me pursuing you with a broom' you shouldn't have. (both) You're so right. Sorry, Yogi. We checked all those Jones' on the list. And nobody ever heard of your little friend. That's hopeless, don't you know? Sheeh! I know. Thanks, Magilla, Yakky, Wally. We might as well head back to the park, Boo-Boo. [tires screeching] That's them, lieutenant. The spotly bear and Santa suited elf. We'll follow them. Car 23 out. I never realized how big this house was before. And lonely. Uh, sir. Oh, Faversham. Any word from the police? Well, I'm afraid not, sir. But I wanted to remind you about your flight to London for that important meeting. Forget the meeting. I don't care about anything except getting my daughter back safely. Also, sir, there's a ranger here to see you. A ranger? As one minion of the law doin', not a chief. How's your bladder? Any interesting cases? Snoop knows a good rapport with police officials is essential. We got an APB out for a guy who's with a millionaire's daughter. Uh...any leads? I ran him through RNI. Description fits clause. 'First name, Santa.' Anything else? Says here he shakes like a bowl full of jelly hangs out with elves. We here he's been making a list. Checking it twice. Probably wants to see who's naughty and nice. Chief, car 23 found that bear who's with the Jones' kid. - Tailed into the park. - Let's roll. They just found the bear who's with the Jones' kid. Garth! A bear? Gee Wilikers! Come on. We gotta tell Yogi. He's really not a bad bear, Mr. Jones. He wouldn't hurt her. When they catch that bear of yours you'll find him in front of this fireplace as a rug. Sir, Chief Blake just called. They located Judy in the park. At last. I wanted to go with my friend, Jokey. Another salmon salad sandwich, oh, author of my being? Thanks, but no thanks, son of mine. 'Are we still going ice skating tomorrow?' 'Then, then to a football game?' We sure are, Augie, my boy. Isn't it wonderful the way this father and son are inseparable? I wanna go home to my daddy. What? I said, I wanna go home to my daddy. [sirens wailing] Well, we struck out Jones wise. What's wrong with that cute little Judy Jones. What's wrong is she's the daughter of J. Wellington Jones. 'Rich person.' Alright, fellas. I think we're gonna have to postpone our Christmas party. For how long? Oh, for about 99 years. Uh, Mr. Ranger, sir, I have been a bad bear. Hold it! I wanna word with that bear. He stole my daughter. No, I never stole anything larger than a picnic basket, Mr. Jones. Judy ran away. Ran away! That's preposterous! I give that girl everything. Toys, clothes, whatever she wants. She wouldn't leave me for you. What could you give her that I haven't? I say about some, uh, time. I'm a busy man. I have a company to run. I'm in meetings all day, all night. Flying to conferences. I'm never home. I.. I'm never home. 'Come on, bear. Time to go.' In there. 'Wait! This is all wrong.' Chief, there's been a mistake. I'll take full responsibility. That bear is not the guilty one. I am. Daddy, I love you. And I love you, Judy. ♪ We wish you a merry Christmas ♪ ♪ We wish you a merry Christmas ♪ ♪ We wish you a merry Christmas ♪ ♪ And a happy new year ♪ [everyone cheering] (all) 'Yeah.' Oh, this is fun. Why don't we all go back to my mansion? 'It's warmer. I have a big tree and gifts and--' We like it better here, daddy. - 'Yeah, we sure do.' - 'Yeah, yeah.' Okay, okay. You're right. I like it better here too. As long as I'm with my little girl. Well, Boo-Boo boy looks like everything worked out okay. I just straightened everything out with the police, Yogi. And it wasn't easy. Please, Mr. Ranger, sir. Forgive me. I didn't mean to cause you all these predicaments. Please! Please! Get up, Yogi. Yogi, because of you, I.. I mean I.. Oh, what's the use? Merry Christmas, Yogi. Merry Christmas to you, Mr. Ranger, sir. I'll carol the night with my friend. 'The most terrifical ranger in the world.' Oh!
