[HEAVY BREATHING] [TAPE REWINDING] [CLICK] WOMAN: Race? Trust me. After all that's happened, I know it's hard, but you got to believe me when I say that you mean everything to me. [LAUGHS SLIGHTLY] Anyway, I found the exact place in the mountains where I'm going to take you. It'd be the prefect spot for a cabin. It's just the place to raise a family. Peaceful and so beautiful. We'd be so happy there. [SIGHS] I've sent you another picture so you won't forget me. I had about a dozen taken, but, well, this is the best. At least it's like we're together. And... One day, well... One day... [CRYING] God, Race, why are they doing this? Why can't we be together? It's not fair. [CRYING] They're going to take you away. They're going to take you away and they're going to... They're going to kill you. [DOOR SLAMS] But I'm here, okay? And I know you're innocent. And I know we will be together. And I'll always love you. Your Steph. [RACE HUFFING] RACE: You have no idea what your letters mean to me, Steph. Twenty-three hours a day in my cell. Chow down, faggot. RACE: God, it can get to you sometimes, but hearing your voice soothes me like... waves softly lapping on the shore. And sometimes I forget that they're going to execute me for a crime I didn't commit, and I hope that... Oh, who am I kidding? Hey, Horton. Thanks. I enjoyed it. Oh, hey, you know... that's what Eisenhower was reading when he died. You're joshing me. Ha. RACE: You know the guy in the next cell, Morgan? He's got his date now. God, it's horrible to watch what that does to a man. I should know. I've had seven myself. But I'm not downhearted. My book is still on the best-sellers' list. Could you believe it? [MEN SHOUTING] I've got this great new lawyer. She knows I'm innocent and she's determined to prove it. After seven years, it's a little hard to believe, Sometimes I just want to reach my hand out into the darkness and imagine you're there, because it's your faith in me, Steph, that keeps me going. Well, first thing in the morning and the last thing at night, I'll be thinking of you. All my love, Race. Jesus, can you believe this shit? You should hear this guy! He's got this stupid bitch buying every line! I mean, why does she want him? He's a fucking wife killer! Are we doing something wrong here? [GAME PLAYING ON TV] A visitor for you, Studley. Get up. Look at you. You are so beautiful. Oh, God, I wish... Just wish that... LITA: It's okay. I know. Me, too. Hey, one day, we're gonna take a car out on the salt flats, just us with the top down, sun on our faces... And drive like the wind. And drive like the wind. [SIGHS] Just you and me. I promise. You're somethin'. STEPH: I dreamt about us last night, Race. We had a family. LITA: One day, we're gonna take a car out on the salt flats, and drive like the wind. [SIGHS] Hey, Gloria, How you doing? GLORIA: Race, I got a date for my visit, and they sent me a list of everything I can and can't wear. Nothing provocative, no short skirts, no slits, no low-cut tops. 'Course, they don't say anything about what you can wear underneath. What do you think? Oh, my Lord. [DOOR LOCKS] [HANDCUFFS UNLOCK] Okay. A further stay of execution has been denied. I'm so sorry. How long? April 23rd. That's nearly three months. RACE: You got to help me, Judith. JUDITH: I'm praying for us, Race. You're my gift from God. It's no accident he brought us together. He's watching over us. And I'm never gonna let you down. Every morning I wake up and there's nothing. And I just can't take it. I know. It's hard. But you're strong. You can keep it together. And I'm here. Right beside you. I just want it to end, Judith. [DOORS SLAM] Okay. 9:30 p.m. You've just found out your wife's been sleeping with your best friend. You're angry. You have a fight. The neighbors hear you. So? Bear with me. 9:45, you say you left, but no one sees you leave. 10:12, gunshots are heard and your wife's found dead. She's been shot in the head and chest and her wedding finger's been severed. Now, the finger really hurt you with the jury. But now we have a man who says he saw you leave. And then 20 minutes later, he sees Tolly enter your house, hears gunshots, and then sees Tolly come running out. Oh, bullshit! We're done in here! Hey! Open up! Fine. Go back to your cell, Race. Forty-three days, you count them. Forty-three days and I'm not wasting my time listening to this shit. -I'm outta here! -Hey! If you don't want to hear about a key witness that was never called to testify, that's fine by me. Oh, yeah, like I hear key witnesses don't get called all the time. Open up! Well, your lawyer never called this one because the DA never let him know he existed! It was an election year. They were going for a slam dunk. He suppressed the evidence. You're listening. Good. Because we've got this whole fucking system by the balls, Race. And we are going for a retrial. [DOOR SLAMS] GUARD: Hey, close the door on all. -Move it, Morgan. -MORGAN: I don't wanna go! No! Please! [MORGAN STRAINING] Please, don't take me. You gotta give me a little bit more time! Will somebody please help me? Can you help me, please! [CRYING] Shut up! Quit crying. Hey, Norm, check this one out. Not tonight, I got tickets for the game. Gotta get... No, no, wait, this one's perfect. RICE: I'm gonna spread your legs as wide as they can go, and I'm gonna take a black cherry Popsicle, and I'm gonna let it drip all the way up your legs up to your thighs, -and then I'm gonna push it right... -[STOPS AUDIO] [CHUCKLES] Black cherry ice pop. Oh, man. Hustler’s gonna love this. That's a very sad man. Cutler, I'm outta here. MAN: Where you going, Parker? You can forget that game, man. You're gonna be here all night with these. Oh, man. That prick Darnell. Not all four. Not tonight! Fucking jerk! I swear, one day... [WHISPERS] Do it. What? [WHISPERS] Switch 'em. [LAUGHING SOFTLY] HORTON: King to bishop four. RACE: Two days and you come up with that? You move in a week, boy. [MOVES CHESS PIECE] Uh... Uh, Horton? How's the... Sylvia? Oh! Don't ask. Don't ask. Oh, don't tell me. You still have not asked her out? HORTON: You know, Race, I was just thinking, Maybe you can give me a few pointers? It seems to come so easy to you. [CHUCKLES] I don't know about that. Well, you better look around, boy. You must be doing something right. RACE: Horton, it's not quite the same in here. This isn't like dating. This can only work in here. With me on one side of the bars, them on the other. Everything fits in here, you know? Everybody's safe. What if you get out? What happens then? You better think about it, son. Retrial could go your way. Checkmate. [TAPE REWINDING] Listen to this. WOMAN: [IN DISTORTED VOICE] Hi, Race. Thanks for your letter. I really enjoyed receiving it. Trouble is, it wasn't for me. Ah, but, hey, that doesn't matter, right? We're all interchangeable, right? I trusted you. I told you things. What did it mean to you? Nothing! Well, from now on, I'm going to mean everything to you! How could you? Jesus, I'll fucking kill you, you fucking shit! You motherfucker! Damn. How'd this happen? I'm so careful. Well, you got any idea which one it is? What the hell you going to do about it? Wait, I guess. See what happens when the others write. On nights like this, when it's so hot, I like to think about you. Touching you... [SIGHS DEEPLY] You're in all the papers again, Race. Maybe all those letters I wrote that idiot governor paid off. You know, I got a good feeling about this, Horton. So let's do it. If this goes your way, what you gonna do about her? I'll go see them and find out who got the switched tapes. Then what? Then I'm gonna put things right. HORTON: Hmm. Sounds dangerous. I have to, Horton. Still ain't got no idea who it is, huh? No. They keep writing like nothing's happened. And she sent me another one. What? Same as the last? Worse. You think she's serious? What do you think? Ha! I think you better watch your back, son. WOMAN: [IN DISTORTED VOICE] I bet it really gets to you not knowing who I am. But I know you, Race. You're pretending this isn't a problem. You're hoping it'll just go away. That's not gonna happen. You betrayed me. I am not gonna let you get away with this. You are gonna die, Race. I'm gonna see to that. JUDGE: Will the defendant please rise? Members of the jury, have you reached a verdict? We have, Your Honor. "In the matter of The People vs... WOMAN: [IN DISTORTED VOICE] Don't kid yourself. Whatever happens at the trial, the sentence is gonna be the same... JURY FOREWOMAN: ...not guilty. WOMAN: [IN DISTORTED VOICE] Execution. [LAUGHING] Execution. [ALL SHOUTING] [ALL CHEERING] You did the right thing! Race, we love you! [ALL SHOUTING] Do you forgive your wife, Race? MAN: How's it feel that she's dead? My client has been cleared of all charges! What did you do with the finger? Race! Race! Race, here! -Race! -Steph! Come on. MAN: Now, move back! [ALL SHOUTING] MAN: You think you can just run away? I wish I could ask you to stay with me, but my parents don't know about you. Mormons, remember? Oh, yeah? It's our secret, okay? Okay. [INAUDIBLE] Cheers. Cheers. Mmm. Mmm. Oh, lord. Hi. Hi. You know, I was just up there talking to my friends, and I suddenly thought, boy, I really... Hey, hey, hey, hey. I'm really sorry, but we're trying to catch up... I'm not talking to you. Wife killer. As I was saying... In case you haven't heard, the verdict was not guilty. Like I care. See, I was sitting up there, when I suddenly thought, boy... I really hope she likes to take it up the ass 'cause he just got out of the butt-fuck motel. Race. MAN: I'd have had my way, pal, you'd be shitting yourself in front of a firing squad right now. Come on, killer. Let's go. Come on. RACE: I have no intention of spending my first night out in a cell. Good evening to you, sir. Excuse me. Good night. [TAPS TABLE] Oh, Steph, I'm so sorry. -I had... -That's all right. RACE: No. I don't know what I was thinking. I never should have brought you to a place like this. STEPH: No, it's fine. Really. [STEPH SCREAMS] No! No! Race! Come on. Come on! Get up, killer! [GROANING] STEPH: Help me! [GROANING] [YELLING] [BOTH GRUNTING] [STEPH CRYING] [YELLING] No! [STEPH YELLING] Get out! [GRUNTING] Not guilty, motherfucker! Not guilty, motherfucker! You hear me? God damn it! Race, stop. Oh, my God. For God's sake, you're gonna kill him. Race, stop. Race. [GROANS] [DOOR OPENING] Oh, thank you. I'm really sorry, Steph. Are you kidding? Anyone would've done that. No, no, no. I don't believe anyone would've done it. I wanted to kill that guy. It's just like the joint. They'd come at me and... Look, I don't want to be like that. I'm not like that. I'm not. I know exactly what you're like. Do you? After all these years, there are no secrets. Steph? Did you keep all my letters? Of course. They're my most precious things. Did you ever get any, uh... What? -Uh... -What? I was wondering... Do you remember the one about Morgan the night that he... the night he died? Let's not talk about that now. No, it's important. Not tonight. Steph, I... Not tonight. [TELEPHONE RINGING] ANSWERING MACHINE: Hi, this is Lita. Hey, Lita, it's Race. I'm not in right now, but I do accept collect calls. [BEEP] [TELEPHONE RINGS] ANSWERING MACHINE: Hello. This is Judith. Please leave a message. [BEEP] Judith, hi. It's Race. Um... I'm sorry you're not there. I was hoping... Hello, Race. I was just thinking of you. Yes, I would, too, but it's not a good time right now, what with the harvest and all. I'll see you soon. I'll find you. I know where you are. Good-bye, Race. God bless. Thanks for meeting me, Race. It's good to see you. Ha. I just needed to talk to you in person, you know, face-to-face, not on the phone. Yeah, that's okay, 'cause I needed to talk to you, too. Gloria, do you remember the night Morgan died? Oh, my, this... This is so difficult. Yeah, I guess it is. Oh, hey, there's a... if it's still there, there used to be a cafe down Morella Lake a little bit, -If you want to go and... -I have to be someplace at 3:00. At 3:00? Well, we've got a little time. Actually, it's the penitentiary. Visiting time, remember? You're seeing someone else. Someone I've been writing to, yes. Poor baby. He's only 23. He's all alone. So I... I don't think we should see each other anymore. This is about the tapes, isn't it? Oh, Gloria, look, I should've told you. I am really sorry. I never meant for any of this to happen... What are you talking about? You're not the only person I wrote to. Oh, honey, come on. I never thought I was. -You didn't? -No, of course not. Well, then I don't get it. What is the problem? You got released, Race. Race, listen, our relationship was very important to me. But everything... it's changed now. Why? It's different out here. In there, everything between us, every word, every moment counted, because we never knew when they were gonna take you away. How you gonna live up to that? One more thing. What? When did you start writing this guy? Race, I'm sorry.

We finally caught him outside of this place called Woodfords, which just happened to be over the state line. I was outside my jurisdiction. They let him go. So I began to follow this asshole. Wherever he went, there I was, in his face, just waiting for him to slip up. And when he did, I'd be there to teach that fucker a lesson he would not forget. And did you get him? No. He sued the department for harassment. And you lost your job for that. No, that only happened after I called the lieutenant a fuck pig. A fuck pig? I was being nice. [LAUGHS] Fuck pig.

There's something I've gotta ask you. Uh... Do you remember the tape I sent the night Morgan died? Uh, yeah. Sure. Why? It's possible that you got the wrong tape. What do you mean, "wrong"? I mean... I think you might have gotten someone else's. Someone else's? You weren't the only one I wrote. There were four of you. Four? [SHARP SIGH] Four! Lita, please try...

[TIRES SCREECH] Next time, maybe I'll just blow it up. [TAPE STOPS] WOMAN: [IN DISTORTED VOICE] Did you think you could just explain it all away, Race? Did you think a visit and an apology would do it? Well, it won't. It never will. The sentence is still execution, Race, and you're gonna be dead. [TAPE FAST FORWARDS] She always said, "Never trust a man." Even when I was little. Every night she'd come into my room, and she'd warn me. "Never trust them." That's what she said. [TAPE FAST FORWARDS, PLAYS AGAIN] JUDITH: When I was a girl, I was afraid of the dark. Momma used to light a candle so I wouldn't get afraid.

How long has he been doing this? You don't understand. He's under a lot of pressure. What did you think was gonna happen when I got out? Race would take me away. Make me happy. It would be our perfect world. Oh, Steph. All this is your fault, isn't it? Isn't it? You couldn't wait, could you? You had to go snooping around, checking up on me. Spoiling it! I never meant to hurt you, Steph. I'm used to it. DEEJAY: KVIB AM 670. I'm here talking with Horace Darnell. -It's Race. -Race Darnell. He is an ex-convict and author of Waiting to Die: A Death Row Diary. So, are you surprised by the success of the book? Well, uh, it is truly amazing that the ramblings of a death row inmate could sell a few books. [CHUCKLES] Now, I understand, Race, that you ex-cons are catnip to the ladies, huh? I don't know about that, but a lot of people do seem to like the book. Aw, come on, Race. there are no secrets here. Let's take some calls. Dennis Frazier of Heber, hello. DENNIS: Um, what was your favorite food inside? Uh, the chef did have a certain way with road kill. Thank you, Mr. Frazier. Uh, Annette Pakula, you're on the air. Are you there? ANNETTE: Are you enjoying your freedom, Race? Ooh. I feel great, thank you. Needless to say... I used to feel great, before you tore my heart out! DEEJAY: Thank you, Ms. Pakula. WOMAN: You told me you loved me, but you didn't mean it. You lied! You're not gonna get away with it. -I'm gonna rip your heart... -[PHONE DISCONNECTED] Wow! Okay, thank you, Ms. Pakula. Uh, like I said, Race, catnip. You heard it here first, folks, on KVIB... [FOOTSTEPS FROM BEHIND] [METAL SCRAPES, GLASS BREAKS] WOMAN: [IN DISTORTED VOICE] The future of Race Darnell... [STATIC BUZZ ON TAPE] [TAPE STOPS, FAST FORWARDS] [TAPE PLAYS, STATIC BUZZ] Come on! [TAPE PLAYS, STATIC BUZZ] Ah! MAN: Oh, Jesus. Look familiar? Get me a phone. SINGLETON: Lab just called. All the tests are back. No sex crime. Okay. No rape. No robbery. What have we got here? I pulled the Darnell file, Chief. Patrick, it's all just like I said. Same M.O. Victim's been shot. Same finger severed. Doesn't make sense. Why would someone who's just avoided being executed do that which put him on death row in the first place? So, what do you think? Copycat? Or an entirely unrelated crime. And the finger? Maybe jealousy. Coincidence. Maybe Darnell's just anxious to get back to work after a seven-year break. Maybe we should keep an open mind. We just got a positive I.D. on those prints from the frame. They are Race Darnell's. Okay, let's bring him in, hear what he has to say. You got it, Chief. RACE: Somebody's threatening me, Elizabeth, and I have to find out who it is. Have you been to the police? The police? No. Why? Oh, come on, Race. You're not thinking straight. Not thinking straight? They are the last people I'd go to, and you know all they'd do is laugh in my face. So what do you want me to do? I want you to get the phone records. I gotta know who Annette Pakula is. And then what? Look, I will give you legal advice. I will go to the cops with you. But I am not about to be a part of any vigilante bullshit. You want this to end? Then call the cops. Hey, Forrest, check this out. There's a neighbor who can place Darnell here at about 4:00 p.m. CHIEF: I want everything on Darnell. Phone records, girlfriends, boyfriends, whatever. I wanna know everything about him. Uh-huh. Patrick pulled the file today. Do you think you could persuade him to share it with us? Where has he gotten to, anyway? Tell him to put her down, wherever he is. Patrick? Okay, we know Elizabeth Bancroft was his lawyer, but what's his connection to the Prentise woman? There's nothing. There will be. Give me roadblocks on all the major routes out of Salt Lake. And let's not keep this to ourselves. We can still make the local news. Do you want something as a holdup? Um, use the finger. Okay. [CAR HORNS HONK] [CAR HORNS HONK] Oh, my God. You wanna move along there, sir? Yes, sir. Hey, aren't you... [TIRES SCREECHING] [SIREN WAILING] She killed them, Horton. Stephanie and Elizabeth are dead. And I led her right to 'em. I didn't do it. You know I didn't do it. You know I didn't do it! You heard her! You heard her! She's crazy! I... Horton, listen to me! I gotta get to Kansas. It's Judith, Horton. She got Stephanie's tape. She's the killer, Horton. Listen! Listen to me. Don't. Listen to me! Horton, if you think I'm guilty, you call the cops. But you think about it, man. You think about it! The chess, the books, all that time, was that all bullshit? If you think something, you call 'em. You call 'em! But if they get ahold of me, I am a dead man. If you call 'em, I'm gonna watch you do it. Horton, I know who the killer is! Why would I be here if I was lying? You hear me? You look me in the eye when you do it because I have never lied to you, Horton. So you go ahead. You call 'em. Oh, no. SINGLETON: Horton Weaver? HORTON: Afternoon. I was kinda expectin' you folks to show up. Sir, I'm Special Agent Denise Singleton. This is Special Agent Patrick O'Dell. We need to talk about Race Darnell. Has he tried to contact you? HORTON: You guys like to come on in? It's not often I have company. Got a nice pot of calf brains and eggs in there I'd be willing to share with you. SINGLETON: No, thank you. HORTON: You sure about that? SINGLETON: Still, it is possible that Darnell might try to contact you. HORTON: Uh, there's this woman who threatened Darnell, you know. Sending him letters. You might wanna talk to the boys at administration about that. SINGLETON: Thank you. We will. HORTON: Y'all take care now, you hear? -PATRICK: All right. -[CAR DOOR CLOSES] [CAR ENGINE STARTS] [SIGHS] I am really sorry. I never meant to put you in that position, Horton. What the hell did I... What the hell did I just do? That was just horse-thievin' stupid! [DOOR SLAMS] That's right, you gonna get. Go on. I'll tell the lot of ya. Get. [DOOR OPENS] [CLICKS] Kansas, huh? [EXHALES] Okay, who's gonna tell me about the threat to Darnell? What, nobody? Well, there was something, but I wouldn't call it a threat exactly. [LAUGHING] Well, what would you call it exactly? Um, it was more of a kind of a... More of a kind of a lover's tiff. [LAUGHTER] Yeah. [LAUGHING] Lover's tiff? Well, that's okay then. For a minute there, I thought you were wasting my time. I'm here investigating a double homicide, and when I ask a question, I don't expect an exercise in obfuscation. Do I make myself clear? Don't fuck with me. Darnell... He wrote to four different women. Names? There was one. Anita? Rita? It was Lita. She worked in a bank. Right. No, wait a minute. Wasn't she a security guard? Yeah, something like that. Where's she from? She's the Reno one. You should really talk to Horton. 'Cause he and Darnell, they were kind of close, you know. Excuse me, ma'am. Bring him in. I wanna talk to him. Horton? You can't. He's on leave. Something about a sick uncle. ♪ Where seldom is heard ♪ What about Lita? I don't think so. Well, Horton, I... Jeez. Who knows? You know, it could be any of 'em. All I know is this Annette Pakula has my tapes. We find her, we find the killer. [CRICKETS CHIRPING] [DOOR OPENS] Chief, I just talked to the uncle. He's not sick. Hasn't even spoken to Weaver. Better put an A.P.B. out on his car and a watch on the uncle's house. Jesus. Who does he think he is? Wyatt Earp? [CHUCKLES] Maybe. Maybe. HORTON: Partner, you ever check a few pages, this is straight out of Zane Grey. Yesiree. RACE: [CHUCKLES] How'd you get this chicken to taste like this? HORTON: Dropped it in the fire. You did? [CHUCKLES] Ready for another longneck? RACE: Yes, sir. [SIGHS] When you came out of that house carrying that gun, I really thought you were gonna shoot my ass. [LAUGHING] [BOTH CHUCKLING] Yeah, so did I. [CHUCKLING] [IMITATES GUNSHOT AND LAUGHS] [YAWNS] You want me to drive? No, I'm all right. It's not far now. Uh-oh. What? Put the hat on. Put the hat on. Don't look at him. Don't look away from him either. Put the map down, don't act like we're not from here. Is he braking? Not yet. [SIGHS] [SIGHS HEAVILY] What's he doing? We are all right.

I'm sorry. Get back in the car. You killed her. I didn't kill her. You killed her. Just like you killed your wife. And you killed Stephanie. Whoa. No, that was you, you fucker. And Elizabeth. Back up. Back up! You were here all the time. No, I wasn't. I followed you from Horton's. [POLICE SIREN WAILING] POLICEMAN: [ON P.A.] Race Darnell! Come out with your hands up! You in the field, hold it right there! All right, boys, he's in the field! Come on, boy. Get on in. [POLICE SIREN WAILING] Who the hell is she? Lita! Dumb. Coming so fast. Horton? Horton? Go somewhere else! Go, go, go, go! Get these cuffs off me now! Shit! -[GUNSHOT] -[TIRE DEFLATES] [ALL SCREAMING] He's gonna get fucked. [HORSE NEIGHS] [GUNSHOTS] Yee-hah! [SIRENS WAILING] Whoa! [GRUNTS] [SIRENS WAILING] Horton? Horton, you all right? Catch the killer, son. That's our only hope. Come on, Race! Come on, let's go! -LITA: Race! -Gotta go! Get riding, son. That's the only chance... [GROANS] RACE: Why did you take the cuffs off? LITA: Maybe I'm crazy, but I don't think you're the killer. [INDISTINCT POLICE RADIO CHATTER] Three. Jesus. Two more, you get a set of steak knives. Kansas. Not the end of the world, but you can see it from here. That was Reno P.D. Coe was thrown off the force six years ago. She made an arrest that didn't stick. And get this: Instead of letting it go, she stalked the guy. He ended up suing the department for harassment. Ha. Let's go. [CAR APPROACHING] BRINKER: This guy Horton Weaver gave up everything he knows, but it's not much. Darnell's headed for New Orleans looking for someone called Gloria, the redhead. Excuse me. So what, we wait for Darnell to waste this Gloria? I'll get the New Orleans office onto it. SINGLETON: Wait. Wait. Wait. Don't you get it? Darnell's not the killer. Like hell, he isn't. Last month, he was on death row for Christ's sake. Everywhere he goes, somebody dies. You know what you're doing? -Uh-huh. -Get down. Get down. [CHILDREN YELLING] PATRICK: Who do you think it is? I think it's a woman, and I think it's Coe. Why? Well, look at what we know about her. I mean, look at why she was thrown off the force. PATRICK: So she overstepped her mark. What's the big deal? Don't tell me you never felt like that. But she was right. The guy was a piece of shit. Okay, but she is controlling. She is a loner. Yet, she had this intense relationship with Darnell. PATRICK: How does that make her a killer? [ENGINE STARTS] SINGLETON: Look, she gets somebody else's tape, okay? Let's go. SINGLETON: She realizes that what she and Darnell have isn't something special. It's exactly the same crap she's had from every other man in her life. So what? A tough break is all. It's more than that. She goes way off the deep end. I mean, look at what she does. She threatens Darnell while he's still on death row. I mean, you're not going to tell me that that's rational behavior. So then Darnell gets out. She starts following him around. Stalking him. Remember, Patrick? Then she finds out that there were four other women. Oh. Now the betrayal's worse than she imagined. That's a lot of competition out there. So she kills the Prentise woman, -Then the attorney. -Why her? I don't know. Uh... Because Darnell went to see her? Because she was pretty? Go on. Then she heads for Kansas and Judith Dutton. Kills her... But Darnell shows up. So Coe makes like she just found the body. -Hmm. -BRINKER: Why go to all that trouble? Why not just kill Darnell, go to New Orleans, and finish it? I don't know. What? I'm trying to figure you out. Look, Race, the feds all think you did it. The only people who know you're not the killer are you, me, and Gloria. The minute they catch you, the manhunt's over. She'll come after me. Let's just say I got a vested interest. Am I the only one that gets it here? What is wrong with you people? All the evidence points to Darnell. [TELEPHONE RINGS] You got nothing on Coe. Brinker. Hey, it doesn't mean we're wrong. Oh, please. [MAN TALKS INDISTINCTLY] All right. We're on the way. CHOPPER PILOT ON DISPATCH RADIO: We're heading due south. Okay. Keep on that heading. Can't believe it. [LAUGHING] The FBI. Whoo! [BOTH PANTING] [DOGS BARKING] Wait till I tell my daddy about this. He'll be greener than six-day roadkill. [LAUGHS] Why don't you steer them on a bearing of 2-0-0. Roger that. Bearing 2-0-0, Chief. BRINKER: What's your ETA? 40 seconds. In 30 seconds, back off. Ground units will handle it from here. PILOT: Roger that. [PANTING] [DOGS BARKING IN DISTANCE] I don't like this. We gotta do it. RACE: Let's go. Go ahead. Ceasefire! Hey, hold your fire! Didn't you hear that? Lita, come on! Jump, come on. Pull up there. -I can't. -There's no choice. One... two... three... [GUNSHOTS] Hold your fire! Hold your fire! [SINGLETON GROANS] Well, shit. [LAUGHING] Looks like you lost him. I want men on foot with dogs on both sides of the river. I want a chopper overhead, I want divers in the water from a half-mile upstream, to three miles downstream, and you can tell this pissant he can walk home. You can walk home. BRINKER: Yes, we can and we will. All right. Pack your toothbrushes, children, we're going to New Orleans. Gloria's called. LITA: God, it's cold in here. RACE: At least it's dry. LITA: Did you find any wood out there? RACE: Yeah. A little. You have any idea where we are? Arkansas someplace. Yeah? You know where we're going, though, right? Yeah, I know where we're going. LITA: I always hated that picture. RACE: I didn't. So that's Gloria, huh? Yep, that's Gloria. Can I see? Yeah. She's beautiful. RACE: Obviously, you didn't know her. She lied about everything. She... She even lied about her name when she threatened me on the radio. She called herself Annette Pakula. Race, listen to me. You've got to trust me. Hey, you. Can you break a 20? Uh, hang on. Yeah. Thanks. Race. Shh. I'll be right back. Mmm. MAN: Hey! Hey, boy! Come on, Race. -Get out of my cab! -Come on! Let's go! Hey, get out of my cab, boy! [TIRES SCREECH] Get out of my cab! That's my cab! [TIRES SCREECH] Damn! I know who you are. What? Okay. So I made the call. Look, I was drunk. I was angry... I don't want to hear it. Pakula was my married name. [TIRES SCREECH] What the fuck are you doing? Stop the car. We're going to the cops. I'll take my chances with them. I said stop! [CLICKS] Come on. You want to kill me? Do it. [GRUNTS] GLORIA: I called you as soon as I got in last night. I was in New York at a book launch. We know they're headed here, So we want to set up an operation here at the center. I don't understand. Why don't you just arrest them when they get here? We need to create a situation where they're forced to play their hand. Oh, you mean you want to use me as bait. That's about the size of it, yeah, but don't worry. I'll be with you all the time, and we'll have the place covered. I saw Race just after he was released from prison, And I don't believe he's the killer. Neither do we. Coe just entered from the Lafayette Street entrance. I could take her, Chief. Nobody move until I say so. Let's see what she does. She's on her own, Chief. In battle, victory is gained by surprise. Excuse me. I was wondering... Could you please give me Gloria Stevens' apartment number? I can't do that, but I'd be happy to tell you if she's in. No. It seems as though she just stepped out. She must be on her way down. Thanks. Singleton? Okay, boss. Let's go. [ELEVATOR DOOR DINGS] Suspect's at the elevator. Copy, chief? Don't do anything to spook her. Excuse me, folks. [ELEVATOR DOOR DINGS] F.B.I. Put down your weapon. -Drop your weapon, Coe! -Coe! Drop it, Coe! SINGLETON: Don't do it, Lita. PATRICK: Drop it now! [SINGLETON YELLS] Shit, it's Darnell. [GLORIA YELLS] Shit! Go! Go! Take the stairs! Go! You, you, with me! Give me the gun, Lita. Don't move, or I'll blow her head off. Roof or apartment? All right. Give me a team on the stairway and one on the roof. Let's go. Let's do it. Let's go. [GUNSHOT] [GRUNTS] I need a plan of her apartment, -and could you get me a layout of the roof? -You bet. I want a chopper up there and have the paramedics standing by. Go. LITA: Inside. Okay. Get down. Get down! Face down on the floor! Now! Lita, don't do this. Get down. Down! Okay. [SIREN WAILING] Lita, I understand better than anybody how you're feeling. -Where are they? -What? LITA: The tapes you stole. RACE: Lita, give it up. It's over. [TELEPHONE RINGS] Get back! [TELEPHONE CONTINUES RINGING] [GRUNTS] Where are the tapes? [YELLS] -[GUNSHOT] -[GROANS] [GROANING] [GROANING] [RACE GROANING] Watch her. [MOANS] -It's okay. -[GRUNTS] I'll take that now. Wha... [LITA MOANS] No! [LITA GASPS] No! No! [GASPS] [LITA SCREAMING] Oh, don't worry. I'm not gonna kill you. RACE: Gloria, no! You haven't got much time. The FBI will be here any minute. Hey, Singleton. Isn't this great? [CHUCKLING] I listened to that tape just like I listened to all your tapes. I put on the headphones. Pressed the button. And there you were, in my head. [CHUCKLING] And I heard all the tenderness in your voice. All the love. And then I heard you say Judith. And then I listened to all her tapes to you. All those lonely, pathetic dreams. O'Dell, where the hell are you? Twelfth floor, boss. And she was right. My granny. She raised me. She knew. She told me all about men. She said you all were scum! Sweaty, filthy, just pounding away. I wanted it to be different with you. You heard our secrets. Our most intimate thoughts. We opened up our hearts to you, and what did you do? Huh? Even though you were in prison, you still managed to do it, you fucked us... and that hurt, Race. [SCOFFS] That hurt so much. I had to stop you. They're your fingerprints on the gun. Now you've killed us all. [LAUGHS] And you're going back to death row. [SCREAMING] [SOBS] I really loved you, Race. I did love you, Gloria. More than you could ever know. It doesn't make what I did right. Don't. No, Gloria, don't. It's over. I'm sorry. At the door. Hold up. Oh, come on. Who are they gonna believe? [LAUGHING] You or me? MAN 1: Freeze! FBI! Hold right there, both of you! MAN 2: Go! Go! -[GLORIA MOANS] -Hold it, Darnell. Drop it! Put down the weapon, Darnell. Nice and easy. Slide it over here. Nice and easy. [GROANS] -Okay. I got the weapon. -MAN 1: Get down! On your face. Get him cuffed. MAN 2: Use mine. MAN 3: Okay, come on. Okay, easy. Easy. Yeah. MAN 4: Look at this. PATRICK: Right. Move her out. Chief, we've got Darnell. -[GROANING] -Okay. GLORIA: [ON TAPE] We opened up our hearts to you, Race, and what did you do? Huh? Even though you were in prison, you still managed to do it, you fucked us... and that hurt, Race. That hurt so much. I had to stop you. They're your prints on the gun. No! MAN: Get her! [TALKING OVER ONE ANOTHER] I'll kill you! I'll kill you! Fucker! Do you hear? I've got two victims. One down here. One by the recorder. [GLORIA SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY] Help you up. [COUGHS] Lita? I brought someone to see you. Jumpin' Jehoshaphat. Hey. Hello, come here. -Ow, ow. -God, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You okay? -Yeah, it's okay. -Sorry. So, I thought they arrested you. Well, Agent Brinker here, he pulled a few strings. Well, it's been a great pleasure meeting you, Mr. Darnell. Take care. -Agent Brinker. -Harvey. Mr. Weaver. Oh, thank you. Here's to memories, partner. See you later, Race. See ya, Horton. Hey, Horton. One thing. Yee-hah? You take care, Professor. Yee-hah! LITA: One day, we're gonna take a car out on the salt flats, just you and me with the top down, with the sun on our faces, and drive like the wind.
