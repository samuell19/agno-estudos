It's my relationship with women. The first time I fell in love was in high school. And there was this girl that-- I used to write her poems, and I'd buy her gifts. But no matter what I did, I just couldn't get her attention. So I fucked her sister. It got her attention, but then I just wasn't interested anymore. And the problem is that this little scenario... would set the tone for relationships most of my life. You know, I meet a girl, I get her, but then I just lose interest, and there's nothing I can do about that. When I stopped drinking, I really thought all of this was going to change, but it hasn't. And the worst part is, most of the women around here... have caught on to me. It's a small goddamn town. We need some new blood. [ Man ] Do you want it ? Do you want it ? The walls could use another coat of paint, and the water pressure's-- Do you want it ? Okay.I want it. [ Sighs ] What can I get for you? Uh, the manager.How do you make that again ? [ Snickers ] You know, it has been a long day, and, um, I left my sense of humor back at the last place... that wouldn't hire me. That's him over there. Thanks. Don't thank me until you meet him. [ Clears Throat ] What's up, beautiful? I was wondering if you had a position open for a bartender. No.Okay. Wait a minute. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Sam.Yes, Kevin. You're going to have to hire somebody... when Alan goes to Sonoma with his family. Let me see if I get this straight. I should hire her because you want to fuck her. No. You should hire her 'cause she's fresh meat. Everybody else is going to want to fuck her too. Come on. Can you start tomorrow night ? I think Nina's having an affair. An affair ? With who ?I don't know. What makes you think she's seeing somebody ?I just know. You serious ?I'm dead serious. So confront her with it. I can't. She'll just deny it. I need proof. Just promise me you ain't gonna hire a private detective... and have her followed around like you did with Kate. Are you out of your mind ? Do you know how expensive that turned out to be ? I spent that kind of money on Kate, she'd probably still be with me. What are you going to do if she's seeing somebody ? Ask her to marry me. You've obviously given this a lot of thought. You ever had a woman cheat on you ? Nah. I'm usually the one fooling around. It's a strange feeling. There's this part of me that wants to kill her, which is a big part. Yeah. And there's this other part of me that's kind of-- kind of turned on by it. Turned on by it ?Maybe that's the wrong word. I don't even want to go there. It's like when I was a little kid. I had this toy car, my favorite toy in the world, right ? After a while, I moved on to my other toys. It just sat in the corner, collecting dust. The second my little brother picked it up, forget about it-- I had to have it. - That's fucked up, man. - Yep. ♪♪ [ Hard Rock ] ♪ Going back ♪ To my home ♪ Don't know where ♪ I'm coming from ♪ All he wanted was his time ♪ ♪ Don't matter ♪ This time, all right Wow. What are we so angry about ? [ Music Stops ]Where were you ? Oh, I was just so wired after work. I went over to Debra's and had some tea and talked. You still mine, huh ? Actually, I'm really tired. That's great. Great. Everybody else gets... wired. I get tired. Great. Mm-hmm. [ Nina ] Bless me, Father. It's been, like, 16 years since my last confession. I've been dating men since I was 15 years old. And now that I've turned 30, I really don't have very much to show for it... except for a few tons of costume jewelry... and I don't know how many yeast infections. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to say that... to a priest. It's all right, child. Continue. The men-- It was getting really bad, and then I met Adam, who is the nicest, funniest, sweetest man I ever met. And actually, I'm doing everything I can to destroy that. We got to stop seeing each other.I know. I feel really shitty what we're doing.You think I don't ? I have to sleep in the same bed with him.I'm sorry, okay ? I don't know why I ever told you I was unhappy. We just got carried away.I have to stop giving in to my impulses. I care about Adam.Adam cares about you. I hate affairs. I hate them. All the sneaking around and lying. And I'm so damn good at it. Not as good as you think you are.What's that mean ? Adam thinks you're having an affair. - Oh, fuck me ! - [ Gasps ] Does he know with who ? Obviously not, if I'm the one he's confiding in. Shit. I got to get out of here.Relax. What am I gonna do ? He knows. Do what everyone else does. Make him feel paranoid. That's what I'm doing. It's not working. There's no reason Adam has to know about us. This never happened.This never happened. Fine. Good.Fine. Good. Did you do something with your hair ? I cut it.It looks good. Brings out your face. I like it. Pretty heavy stuff.Excuse me ? The book you're reading. Wittgenstein. Is that how you pronounce it ? Pretentious, huh ? Anyway, I'm impressed. Don't be. It was a gift. I don't understand a word of it. Well, it's pretty simple. Nothing is what it appears to be, and you and I don't exist. How comforting. Anne. - Oh. Rebecca. - You should maybe start with a little Schopenhauer. Oh, is he more hopeful ? Nothing is what it appears to be, but you and I doexist. I'm a teacher.Oh, really ? What do you teach ? Painting at the Art Institute. I always wanted to learn, but I figured you either have talent or you don't. Well, basically, that's true. All I do is stand in front of a lot of rich students, all dressed in black... and explain the difference between a number four and five brush. Beats tending bar. Then sit in on one of my classes sometime. I'd really love to, but I have no talent. Neither do any of my students. What do you say ? Well... as long as you don't make me do homework. I just really like to believe that my days of homework... are behind me.I promise no homework. Tuesday and Thursday mornings at 9:00. How beautiful. Oh, thanks. I have to go. Promise you'll come to one of my classes ? It was nice meeting you, Anne. [ People Chattering ] Oh ![ Glass Shattering ] [ Applause ]Thank you. Thank you. Drink this.What? It's the only useful thing my old man ever taught me. Oh ! [ Coughing ]Feel better ? Oh. Yeah. Good. Now, clean this shit up. [ Sighs ] You mind if I join you ? Oh, no. I don't drink. A bartender who doesn't drink ? More like a bartender who used to drink. How can you stand being around all those drunks ? It's like putting a picture of a fat person on your refrigerator... when you're on a diet.[ Laughs ] Plus the only thing I'm any good at. So, what's it like living here ? You're from New York ?No. At least you won't be disappointed.What's that mean ? Somebody once said San Francisco is a great city... as long as you don't mind running into the same six people over and over again. At least it's six. Where I come from, it's about four. I hear Chicago's eight.Too cold. I think six will have to do. Actually, it's not a bad city. It's pretty cheap to live here. Tolerates any lack of initiative. Then it looks like I'll feel right at home. By the way, what was that stuff you gave me to drink before ? Chartreuse.Tasted like cheap perfume. But it did the trick. It's made by these monks in France. They call it "truth serum." Truth serum ? Yeah, and the truth is-- Whoa ! You don't waste any time, do you ? I just don't see the point. Well, I do. It's my first day at work. I'm kind of tired, just, you know, generally not in the mood. Should I take this personally ? I think you'd save yourself a lot of time if you did. Thanks for the tip. See you inside. [ Laughs ] [ Woman Moaning ] Oh ! Okay ! Yeah ! Yes ! [ Moans ] Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Something's wrong. Wrong ? You don't seem very relaxed. Well, as sad as this might sound, this is about as relaxed as I get during sex. That's unbelievable. Yeah, but true. Why do you find this so stressful ? [ Sighs ] What do you want ? I mean, this is my first lesbian experience. Although, I must admit, I'm not much better with men. I could tell from the start you weren't gonna make it all the way through this. You could ? Let's just say it's customary to fake the orgasm at the end, not the beginning. Same way when you fake it with a man. I'll try and remember that. So why did you come to see me ? Well, I always wondered what it would be like... to have sex with a woman. And what was it like ? Definitely not for me. - Okay. - Oh, um, uh, don't get me wrong. You're very attractive. - But ? - I like men. I had sex with a man once. The earth didn't move ? I was having no fun. That thing of his just kept getting in the way, and it wasn't hitting the right spot. It just seemed so unnecessary. Gee, that's not how I would describe it. I'm curious. What is it that you like about sex with men ? Gosh, you know-- [ Laughs ] I'm just getting a little embarrassed talking to you like this. After everything I've been doing to you for the last 45 minutes, you're embarrassed talking like this ? Yeah. You're too easily embarrassed. The story of my life. [ Woman ] I did it ! I finally told my parents about us. You were right. They didn't take it very well. So I'm back a day-- early. [ Door Opens, Closes ] Who the hell was that ? Someone I've been trying to find a way to break up with. Mission accomplished. Coming out of the closet with your parents... on the same day you catch your lover in bed with another woman... is not a lot of fun. Oh, God, my parents. Well, that was never the healthiest of relationships. But I really care about Anne. The worst part is, I can't even be sure... this is the first time she's screwed around on me. All I can do is fixate on the night she came home late, the students she couldn't stop talking about. How many times has this happened ? I feel like a fool. This is just a suggestion, but you might want to up my dosage this month. What's so important I had to meet you here ? Can we just drive somewhere ?Kate, I'm working. Adam, please. Okay. Just get in the back. [ Adam ] That sounds like the Anne that we all know and love. We used to be pretty happy. There's a part of me that's sitting here... feeling that justice has been served. But there's another part of me... that's really sorry she hurt you. You know, I still care about you. Oh, that's sweet. There's nothing sweet about it, okay ? I know the plan for us was to stay friends after everything, but the only reason I tried to stay friends... is 'cause I still haven't gotten over you. This can't possibly come as news to you. Well, what about the woman that you were with ? Nina ? She and I are having our own little problems. Oh, is that why you're acting like this ? When we were together is the only time that I've been in love. Oh, Adam.What ? You're writing a lot of revisionist history. We fought all the time. And you were pretty scary toward the end. Scary ?You wouldn't let me out of your sight. You wouldn't let me go anywhere without you. I got a little bit overpossessive. You had a private investigator follow me around. Let's not forget about the photos he took. When I met Anne, she opened up another side of me. I didn't do this so we could fight.Why didyou do this ? I-- I thought I could talk to you about this. I guess I was naive.Yeah, I guess you were. I shouldn't have called you. Wait. I'll stop acting so psychotic. Thank you. Oh ! Oh, God ! Adam ! Take me back to the city. I'm not proud of that. That was a mistake. [ Sighs ] It's just, being around you-- You being available, I kinda lost it. I'm sorry. You know how you feel about me ? That's how I feel about Anne. You know, if you want, I could kick her ass for you. I'm serious. I'm pretty sure I could take her in a fight. [ Snickers ] The funny thing is, it's because of me Kate decided to take one of Anne's art classes. We both knew Anne was gay. It was no big deal. It never occurred to me that Kate might have any interest in being with another woman. Pretty soon I started to have my doubts. And so I thought I'd test them out one night... and try to get the three of us together, see how into it she'd be. She was very into it. [ Bell Ringing ]Try and finish your watercolors by Thursday... so we can move past this horrid medium as soon as possible. If you're here to try and get me to change your grade-- I'm not excusing my behavior, but I did warn you that this would happen sooner or later. Never occurred to me that you were serious. Jesus, Anne. I'm not built for the long haul. I panic when things settle into a routine. I suddenly see myself as this aging lesbian wearing Birkenstocks, walking down a trail in Mendocino, holding the liver-spotted hand of my lover. Don't you like being in love ? We were in love, weren't we ?Of course we were. But even you have to admit things were getting a little domestic between us. Every relationship gets a bit domestic. We could have worked on it. We shouldn't have to work on it. It isn't a crossword puzzle. It's passion. And quite frankly, we ran out of it. I thought only men were led around by their hormones. I'm not like all the other girls. You're not even like all the other boys. For the record, I didn't mean for you to walk in on that. And for what it's worth, I apologize. Why even bother apologizing ? I believe it's customary. I'll pick up my stuff as soon as I find a place to live. No hurry. You're not even gonna try to stop me from leaving, are you ? So we can pick up where we left off ? I don't think that would be fair to you. Oh. Well, thanks for thinking of me, Anne. What do you want to talk about that's so important ? Kevin, I'm busy. Can this wait until later ? No. I'm on a five-minute break, so it's now or never. What's up ? I think that we should stop seeing each other. I mean really stop seeing each other. That's it ? Yeah, that's pretty much it. Fine. [ Loud Thumping ] Did I forget an anniversary ? Mm-hmm. [ Whispers ] Are you fucking Kevin ? I'll take that as a yes. [ Sighs ] How long have you known about this ? Let me get this straight. You want to know how long I've been keeping something from you. Would it make any difference... if Kevin and I weren't seeing each other anymore ? Maybe to Kevin. I know this is going to sound like bullshit, but it didn't mean anything. I still love you. [ Sighs ] Say something ! What do you want me to say ? I don't know ! Scream at me ! Hit me ! Sorry. I don't hit women. I know things have been pretty bad between us lately. I know I haven't been 100 percent there. So I guess on one level, I can't say I blame you. No, no. Blame me. Blame me. How can you be so okay with all of this ? It's like you've been looking for an excuse to end it. Well, if I have, then I'd have to say you've given me a pretty damn good one. I'm curious. Did you ever love me ? What are you talking about ? What do you think I'm talking about ?Kate ? Do you know what it's like to compete with that fucking dyke ? You're not competing with her. That is all you ever think about ! What do you want from me, Nina ? Huh ? I want you to feel the same way about me that you do about her.Really ? Mm-hmm.I do now, 'cause I hate the both of you. [ Door Slams ] I can't believe I blew it with Adam. Over Kevin. I mean, what is it with me and these creeps ? [ Sighs ] The last guy I went out with used to like to smack me around. Finally I left the cocksucker. I'm sorry. But he really was a cocksucker. That's when I met Adam. And he took me in, and he nursed me back to health. And he was really, really good to me. And it was really good for a while. But then I could tell that he wasn't really into it. He still had this thing for his old girlfriend. And the sex stopped happening with any regularity. And I'm just the kind of person that that's just not an option. So... that's when Kevin came into the picture. And for a while there, I thought I had it all. Great sex and someone nice to come home to. But something told me that that couldn't last. And now I have nothing. And something tells me that that canlast. - Hi. - Is Kevin around ? He'll be right out. Can I get you something ? - I'm fine, thanks. - Okay. What's up ? She's all yours. Who's all mine ? Nina. She told me everything. What exactly did she tell you? You really want me to tell you what she said, Kevin ? No. You're a piece of work, man. Why Nina ? Because she was lonely. 'Cause she needed somebody to tell her how beautiful she is, and you sure ain't doing it. But did you have to fuck her too ? Hey, man, I know what I did was wrong. But you ain't even that into her. You just had to have her 'cause you realized somebody else wanted her. It's like your brother and that toy truck. First of all, it was a car, okay ? It was a car. Second of all, you're not my brother. You're not even my friend. Go fuck yourself. Man, we got to talk about this. [ Woman Screams ]There. We talked about it. Nina, I need to see you.Go away ! It's important.Hey ! Hey ! [ Sighs ] We can't stop seeing each other.Oh, Kevin, it's over. I thought so, too, but now I'm just not so sure. [ Sighs ] Well, I am. We're crazy to walk away from what we had.What we had was great sex. We had more than that, and you know it. Who do you think you're talking to ? It's me, Nina. We get together every week and do more than just fuck. We talk. We talk about where we're gonna fuck.We talk about everything. I know you.You don't. If you knew me, you'd stay away from me... 'cause you're the kind of guy who fucked up my life. You slept with your best friend's girlfriend. Excuse me. You had something to do with this too. I know. I'm not proud.I'm not proud either. But what we did, you ain't gonna undo it.What is this about ? This is the most serious relationship I've ever had. I believe it. And you're the only one that's ever seen through my bullshit. I know I act like nothing matters, but this matters to me. If you don't let go, I am gonna hurt you.Nina, I love you. It was around the time I stopped drinking... I first started seeing Nina. She had this boyfriend who was totally ignoring her, and so she was lonely and horny and-- You know, first it was just this great sex. But then she opened up, and I could tell her how fucked up my family was. Then she started telling me about her family. This was like no contest. Her old man is this mafioso back east. He's doing like 200 years in prison for murder... and racketeering and extortion. Sweet guy. I honestly had no idea how I felt about Nina... until she told me she didn't want to see me anymore. Maybe she grew on me. I don't know. Ah. Maybe I just want what I can't have all over again. You know ? Well, it sounds like Nina's really sorry about what she did. Maybe you ought to give her another chance. Don't you think you should give Anne another chance ? That's not the same. Anne's not sorry about what she did to me. Remember that ?Yeah, I remember that. Ouch. [ Sighs ] Kate, look, I got to ask you something. Be really honest. Don't be afraid of hurting my feelings. Is there any shot of you and I getting back together ? No. You want to think about it some more, take your time ? 'Cause it didn't sound like you were quite sure. Let's get out of here before Anne gets back. Was that a definite no ? Or was it kind of a maybe-we'll-see no ? I don't know. [ Kate ] Adam kept trying to get me to pose nude for him, and I always refused. So finally he went and made this painting from memory, and I was forced to look at it every day. I know this is going to sound really weird, but one day I was staring at it, and it suddenly struck me as sort of... beautiful. And I just thought, "Is that me ? Is that what I look like ?" It filled me with a kind of confidence. It was probably the beginning of the end for Adam and me.

Okay, um, I'll just have what you're having.Okay. I feel like an idiot for getting involved with Anne in the first place. Don't beat yourself up. Every young dyke in the Bay Area has to go through their basic training with Anne. It's the first step toward coming out of the closet. She's like Ellis Island to the entire lesbian community here. Did you ever-- No. No, no, no. I was out of the closet long before I got here. No, Anne's thing is corrupting straight girls. [ Chuckles ] Well, you know, you could say she's doing a service. Like teaching starving peasants how to grow their own crops... and feed themselves for the first time. How many of the peasants are stupid enough to fall in love with her ? You're not supposed to fall in love with Anne. You're just supposed to remember her fondly... as your first lesbian experience. Ah. Uh, are-- are you over her ? - Oh, I'm over Anne. - Good. In fact, you know what ?What ? - I don't want to talk about her anymore. - That's fine with me. [ Kate ] See, Anne can't deal with the fact... that she's gay on an emotional level, so she tries to keep it all on a sexual one. That way it's all just a glorified fetish... instead of an actual lifestyle choice. [ Sighs ] So, you want to come up for a drink ? [ Sighs ] Please don't take this the wrong way. Sounds like a no. You have all this Anne residual to deal with. You just passed from the denial phase to the anger phase... during dinner tonight. It's going to be a while before you ever get anywhere near acceptance. You're probably right. So... I'll take a rain check. Call me when you're over her. [ Sighs ] Thanks a lot, Anne. [ Rebecca ] It was probably the fish. I'm sure I'll feel better in the morning. Your card. I'll call you. Oh. There he is. He's here. G-G-Good night. Thanks again. That was great. Okay. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. What's up, Rog ? Go. Go. Call me.I'll call you. Oh, thank you, Debra. Ha ha ! "So, what did you think ? He's cute, isn't he ? Are you gonna see him again ?" Never. - It couldn't have been that bad. - That's easy for you to say. You didn't have to sit across the table from the guy all night long... while he talked about sports. [ Sighs ] Oh, God. Maybe you just made him nervous. Yeah. Why would I make him nervous ?

You know, I don't want you to think... that I usually do this sort of thing. But, um-- Because I really don't. Um, but when do you finish your, um-- - Shift ? - Shift. Kind of late. Oh, well. Anyway, it's probably just as well. I'm a little drunk. Actually, I'm due for a break in a little bit. Oh, yeah ?Yeah. [ Rebecca ] I'm out here in the middle of nowhere with a complete stranger. Let me help you out.Okay. I come from an upper middle class Jewish family in New York. I feel much safer now.[ Laughs ] I moved here after graduating from the Rhode Island School of Design... and rebelled against my parents' generation... by managing to accomplish absolutely nothing.Oh. Unless you count a few paintings... nobody wants to hang in their living room. All right, your turn. Okay. [ Clears Throat ] I come from a white trash Methodist family from Virginia. Now I'm starting to get a little nervous. And right you should. I graduated from Virginia State. And I'm rebelling against my parents' generation... by, um, planning never to get married or have children. Well, I'll tell you what. You've come to the right place.Yeah ? Yep. This is a city full of single people. It's like one huge orphanage. They actually make you leave if you have a child.Really ? The police actually come and escort you out of the city limits. [ Laughing ]It's like the law. The problem is, I'm not putting my energy toward anything else. I wish I could say that I was supporting myself while I paint, like you, but, uh, I don't have any higher calling that I'm aware of. Unless you consider serving booze... to a bunch of tired old drunks an art form. That may be more of a craft.Yeah. Well, at least I have potential. It's a wonderful thing, potential, because as long as I don't do anything, I'll still have it. Oh. Well, that proves my theory. Yeah ? What theory is that ? Well, people who are tragically ambitious and smart go to New York, and people who are just tragically smart come here. Oh. Well, what about people who are just tragically ambitious ? They go to L.A. Right. L.A. So how do you and Kevin know each other ? Well, uh-- [ Laughs ] We were pretty good friends... until I found out he was screwing my girlfriend.Oh. Kind of put a damper on our relationship. Yeah, I'd say it would.Yeah, just a bit. So that's what that little scene was between you two. Yeah. I'm sorry you had to witness that. It was ugly, I know. [ Chuckles ] So, um, are you and this, um, woman still together ? No. Thank you.You're very welcome. [ Giggles ] Um, so, how much do I, um, owe you ? It's gonna be $318.45. Oh. Um, can I owe you ? Just weekly, you know, installments will be fine. Okay. Thank you.I know where you live, so-- [ Laughing ]Look, um-- And, um, I don't know-- I'm not really having a whole lot of success with this sort of stuff. Who is ? When is your next night off ? Um, Tuesday. See you Tuesday. Good night. [ Rebecca ] The worst thing about meeting somebody great... is that eventually I have to sleep with them. And when it comes to sex, I'm pretty hopeless. Sex is highly overrated anyhow. I mean, all that huffing and puffing to accomplish something... that I can do all by myself in about two minutes. Maybe it'll be different with Adam. Maybe not. Somebody should really warn him. You can't keep avoiding me, Nina. Why are you angry at me ? I'm not angry at you.I don't believe you. I don't give a shit what you believe. You're afraid of admitting you're in love with me.Ha ha ! You're seriously delusional. And you think that I'm full of shit, but I'm not. This is different. Nina-- Oh, go away. Stop and talk to me before I have a goddamn heart attack. Go away. You remind me of what we did to Adam. I got news for you. He's doing just fine these days. What do you mean Adam's doing just fine these days ? I got to quit smoking. What do you mean he's doing just fine these days ? He's seeing some girl at work. Rebecca. Are you sure ? [ Panting ] Yeah. [ Coughing ]How long ? I don't know. A couple of days. Nina ! [ Moaning ] Oh ! Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Um, I should just, um, warn you that, um-- um, I'm not very good at this sort of thing. It's okay. I am. [ Moaning ] [ Laughing ] [ Coughing ] Like the Cotton Club in here. Oh, I'm sorry. I know it's a disgusting habit. Thank you for putting up with me during this difficult time. You happen to be very good at this. Nothing I say is gonna convince you ?No, I'm afraid not. Why ? Well, if you must know,I must. I'm not very comfortable with my body. I just don't feel terribly connected to it. I mean, I see men looking at me, at my... breasts, and, um, I don't get it. I mean, I know that the female body is a beautiful thing. It's just too bad this one's wasted on me. Sorry you asked ?A little. Well, actually, this is, um, the most uninhibited I've ever been. I guess I have you to thank for that.Yes, well, you know-- Tomorrow I'm gonna-- I'm gonna work on your backhand a little more. [ Giggling ] Oh, you know, I'm starving. Why don't we go get something to eat ?Food ? Mm-hmm.Well, that's good. I'm kind of hungry. How does Union Street Cafe sound ? Ooh. Ahh. No, that's not good. No ? Why ?No. Um... that's O.G.T."O.G.T." ? Yeah. Old Girlfriend Territory. Oh. We'll think of someplace else.Okay. Ooh, just the mention of it. [ Kate ] They didn't take it very well, so I'm back a day... early. Who's, um, that girl in the photo ? Old, old girlfriend. You two still, um, close ? We talk. Why ? Oh, just, you know, getting jealous, that's all. There's no reason to be jealous of Kate, trust me. Glad to hear it. This is still the only decent bookstore on this side of town. We were bound to run into each other eventually.Kate. I've been meaning to call you. I found it. Kate, this is Maria. Maria, this is--Kate. Jeanette Winterson.Yeah, I finally decided to take your advice and read her. It's nice to know I made an impression. Required reading for all your conquests ? Come on. Play nice. Believe it or not, I am playing nice. It was nice to meet you. ♪♪ [ Instrumental Pop ][ Chattering ] Where is she ? ♪♪ [ Woman Singing ]Where's who ? The woman Adam's seeing. She's on a break. When's she comin' back ? You know, I was kinda hoping you were here to see me. Can I have a cream soda with milk ? ♪ If I look into my future ♪♪ When's the best chef in town gonna come work for me ? When you develop a new personality.What do you mean ? I am lovable. [ Scoffs ] He's a real charmer. Can I get you something to drink ? - No. - Okay. I guess you figured out that's her.She's very pretty. Nina, stop it.[ Chuckles ] You know, you need somebody to love you. Like who ? Like me. [ Clock Ticking, Ship Horn Blowing ] [ Phone Rings ]Mmm. [ Rings ] [ Clattering ] This better be important. What ? I'll be right there. I'll be right there. Who was that ? Uh, there's just, uh, some problem down at the garage. I gotta head over there. Go back to sleep. Be right back. [ Sighs ] [ Buzzing Sound, Door Closes ] What's wrong ? Why don't you come and sit down first ? Okay. I'm sitting. Now, what's wrong ? [ Inhales ] I've been thinking a lot about us lately, And I realized... that I miss it. Don't you miss it ? What if I do ? Let's do something about it. Well, what's wrong ? Y-You just decide all this, and then you expect me to just come running back. Yeah ! [ Scoffs ] You are too much. Why are you doin' this ? I wanna have a baby with you. A baby ? Why not ? Let me count the ways. I know it sounds completely out of the blue, but think about it. Something to focus all our attention on besides ourselves. And we wouldn't have to do it right away, but I-- I think we should, don't you ? Are you on any medication ?That has nothing to do with this. The point is, I think you and I would be great parents. Children. Okay, we make great children. Well, then it's time to grow up. We're like these pathetic, aging grad students... who refuse to move off campus and start living in the real world. We're all so scared. What are we scared about ? Responsibility ? Being somebody's parents ? W-What's so hard about it ? My mother had me when she was 20 years old. What are you saying ? Huh ? You want me to be some sort of surrogate father for you ? [ Gasps ] Oh, God, no. No, Adam, I want us to be together again. I really think we could make it work this time. Oh, what happened to, "I still love you, Kate. I want you back, Kate" ? You can't just lay all this on me and not expect that I have something to say about it. Well, fine. What do you want to say ? I happen to be involved with someone else at the moment. I thought you and Nina broke up. Not Nina. Someone else.[ Chuckles ] - You work fast. Who is it ? - What the fuck difference does it make who it is ? Why are you so angry at me ? Because your timing is-- is way off, okay ? It is wayoff. I happen to care about this person that I'm with now, Kate. [ Footsteps ] [ Door Opens, Closes ] Hi.Hi. Is everything okay ?Yeah, everything's fine. Come back to bed.Okay. [ Kate ] Oh, he forgets, but when Adam and I were together, we talked about having a family. There's only so much you can expect from a sexual relationship. They come, they go. Every time you're left with nothing. A baby's different. It's the next step. It's gotta be. You know, someone to take care of... and force me to be responsible. And I think I'd be a really great mother. You know, I'd feel a lot more comfortable if you said something once in a while. [ Adam ] Can you believe the balls on this woman ? Rebecca's not like that. Nah, Rebecca-- she's real. She's funny, she's sweet. She cares about me. She's not fuckin' my best friend. She's not leaving me for another woman. I mean, that's a quality relationship, right ? [ Man On Speaker ] It's pretty clear what you gotta do, pal. Damn right, it's clear what I gotta do. [ Intercom Buzzing ] Who is it ? [ Adam ] It's me. God, what time is it ? It's pretty late. What are you doin' here ? I wanna talk to you. A-Any chance we could do this tomorrow ? No, we can't do this tomorrow. I'm here now. All right. Come on up.[ Buzzing ] [ Sighs ] [ Door Closes ] How come when you interruptmy life in the middle of the night, I come rushing over ? But when I do it to you, it's, "Any chance that we can do this tomorrow ?" You woke me up to ask me this ?No. I woke you up to tell you that I'm ready to give this one more try. Are you sure you want to do this ? [ Gasps ] We gotta make this quick, 'cause I'm double-parked.[ Laughs ] You okay ? I'm fine. Let's really make this work this time. Let's never fight. That's going to be a little difficult, don't you think ? Hmm, you're probably right. Well, if we have to fight, let's have those fun Tracy-Hepburn fights. You planning on being Hepburn or Tracy ? [ Laughs ] You know, we don't have to make the same mistakes again. We know better now, right ? Right. It's gonna be great. So tell me: What was it like making love to a man again ? I only know what it was like making love with you again. I'm gonna take that as the compliment that I'm sure it was meant to be. [ Kisses ] I missed you last night. Where were you ? What's wrong ? Look, um, we need to talk. Oh. [ Chuckles ] It's about you and Kate, isn't it ? How do you know about Kate ? Well, when I was deciding whether or not to get serious about you, um, Kevin told me about her. Kevin. Yeah, he said that, uh, you still had a thing for her and, uh, it wouldn't be easy to get you over it. But in a moment of uncharacteristic self-confidence, I... told him that I could probably succeed... where others had failed. - Kevin can go fuck himself. - You slept with her last night, didn't you ? It's just that Kate and I have-- Save it. Because the last thing I'm pretty sure I want to hear right now... is about you and Kate, and what a great girl I am, and how sorry you are. Rebecca, I'm sorry. I-- Look, I figure that you're still in love with her, and, um, there's nothing that I can do to change that. I'm a big girl. I took a chance, and it didn't pay off. [ Sighs ] Oh, um, promise me something. If it doesn't work out between Kate and me, I won't call you. Good. Oh, um, by the way, uh, there's something that I should probably tell you. It was me who Kate caught Anne in bed with. I'm the one who broke them up. I guess she and I are even. [ Rebecca ] Every time you fall in love, you go through all your moves. Then the next time you fall in love, you go through them all over again. After a while, it all starts to seem a bit stale and mechanical. And if you do it enough times, it's not magic. Oh, shit. I really liked him. Bye, man.Yeah, see you tomorrow. [ Sighs ] So, how about some of that truth serum ? You sure ?Yeah, I'm sure. You want to talk about it ? [ Exhales ] Adam and Kate are back together. How'd this happen ?Well, she called, and he came running. You okay with it ? I'm not at all okay. Oh, my God ! I can't even believe I told you about that. Oh, Jesus, that stuff really is truth serum. It's okay.I'm just so embarrassed. But I never saw Anne after that night. I swear to God it was the last time.I said it's okay. Come on. Out with it. Come on.Nina's pregnant. With whose baby ?I don't know. Then how do you know she's pregnant ? No comment. Does Adam know ? I don't know. You're still in love with her, aren't you ? Let me put it this way: Yes. Tsk. [ Sighs ] Whatever happened to "happily ever after" in this town ? [ Chuckles ] Are you startin' to regret movin' here ? It's no different anywhere else, is it ? Probably not. [ Kisses ]Good night, babe. See you tomorrow. Kevin, no !Now, this time you gotta talk to me. What do you want to talk about ?Oh, I don't know. Why don't we talk about whose baby's inside you ? Look, you gotta deal with this.I am dealing with it, Kevin. How ?I'm gonna have my baby. Well, what about the father ? Who needs a father ? Nobody needs a father anyway. Wait a minute. You don't needa father, but it sure as well has a father. Look, Nina, if it's mine, I just want to know. Kevin, I don't know if it's yours. It could be Adam's. Well, how do we find out ? Amnio, end of the second trimester. Eh, what is the translation of "amnio" ? What is that ? Four months from now. Four months ? What do we do till then ? Till then, I'm pregnant. What about Adam ? What about Adam ? You didn't tell him, did you ? Oh, I ain't tellin' Adam. The son of a bitch is back with Kate. What happened to the bartender ? She's wondering the same thing. I don't know. Can I feel it ? Is it, like, moving around and stuff ? It's too early. Wanna go for a run ? Wanna go for breakfast ? [ Laughs ] [ Adam ] How can you not know who the father is ? Because I slept with you both that night. That's gonna make a lovely story to tell the child one day. Oh, fuck you.I'm sorry, okay ? I'm sorry. It's just that this news is throwingme a little bit. Yeah, well, join the fucking crowd. What does Kevin have to say about all this ? Kevin is scared to death it might be his. What about you ? I'm great. I don't need anything, Adam. I'm on my own.Wait. A-Are you crazy ? What are you talking about ? You're not on your own with this, all right ? I wanna do whatever I can do to help you out. [ Sighs ] I have to go to work. L-Listen to me. I mean it, all right ? I mean it. I know. I know you want to help. But I'm fine. Will you call me ? Yeah. You promise ? No. Okay, let's talk about it. There's nothin' to talk about. Okay, then let's forget about it. [ Sighs ] What is this gonna do to us ? The phrase, "Bring us closer together" does not come to mind. What are you gonna do if it turns out to be yours ? Be its father.How weird is thatgonna be ? Very. Look, obviously, this isn't how I intended on having a child, but... I don't think I have any other choice. I'm just gonna have to improvise. What about me ? I don't see why this has to change anything between us. Okay ? I think I'm a lesbian. What ? This isn't working for me, and I think it's better to deal with it right now... before we get in too deep.What isn't working for you ? Like it or not, this baby thing's put us in a strange place, so I think we should take advantage of it... and be totally honest with each other. Honest about what ? Being with you again-- It just doesn't feel right. And it's not you, it's me. I'm a lesbian. Well, um-- [ Clears Throat ] I'm glad that, um, you know, that I could clear that up for you. - [ Loud Clattering ] - Again ! Now, are there any other conflicted feelings... that I could help you resolve ? Why don't I fix you a steak ? That way you can decide you're a vegetarian. Tell me, Kate, really, 'cause I'm curious. What exactly did I do wrong ? I don't mean what I did wrong the first time that I brought out your lesbian tendencies. I mean, what did I do wrong this time to confirm them ?Adam, it isn't about you. No, once is bad enough, but twice is really pushing the outside... of the cruelty envelope, don't you think ?I didn't plan it ! Why me ? Couldn't you have singled out some other bastard, spread the pain around a bit ? You know, I'm not the only one who contributed to the failure of this relationship. - You might be a father ! - That's not what this is about. - I'm sorry. - Fuck sorry ! [ Grunts ] God ! I knew you were gonna kill me. First time I ever laid eyes on you. I knew it. I still wanted you. And you got me. - Come here. - No. Come here. Why should I ? Because I want you to. [ Sighs ] At least now you'll probably get over me. I think so.Yeah. That's good, 'cause, uh, I'm gettin' too old for this bullshit. So am I. [ Ringing ] Ma'am, if I may have a moment of your time, I would like to speak to you about our Lord, Jesus Christ. - We need to talk. - Actually, I don't think now's a really good time. Not a good time ? What do you mean ? Now's as good a time as any.[ Sighs ] You want to clue me in as to what's going on here ? [ Sighs ] Tell him. Yeah, tell me. Nina and I are gettin' married. Kevin asked me to marry him, and I said yes. Wow. Certainly hate to rain on your connubial parade here, but what happens if we find out it's mine ? We're not gonna find out. I don't wanna know. What difference does it make whose it is, anyway ? What difference does it make ? Call me crazy, but if it's mine, I'd like to be its father. - Well, you don't love her. - Here's an idea, okay ? Why don't you stay out of this ? Because I do love her. He has-- He has feelings, Nina. That's good. Is that part of the 12-step-induced atonement that you're working on here ? I think you'd better get out of here. That's enough. You're gonna throw me out ? You're the bouncer, right ?I'm gonna throw you out. Let me talk to Adam alone. Call me if you need me. I'm sorry. I did not mean for you to find out this way. What were you gonna do, put together a short film ? What the hell is going on ? - I'm getting married. - Yeah, I heard. What about me ? What about you ?If it's mine, I'm not gonna let another man raise my child. What do you suggest ? I suggest that you let me in on a little bit of the family planning here. Believe it or not, I came over here to tell you that I wanna help you out. I-I show up, and like that, what, you just expect me to walk away without having anything to say about it ? Would you please try and understand what I'm up against here ? Why don't you try and understand what I'mup against here ? M-My ex-girlfriend, who is cheating on me with my former best friend, are now about to get married and have a baby that could be mine ! It's fucked up. It's a really fucked-up situation, okay ? But the baby deserves a father, and I think Kevin's gonna make a really good one. - Are we talking about the same guy here ? - That's not fair. Kevin turned into a really great person when we weren't looking. He said I have this weird effect on him, that I make him do things that he never thought he'd do. He's in love with me. And I'm in love with him. Please. [ Groans, Sighs ] What happens if the kid turns out to be... artistically inclined and have an incredibly nasty sense of humor ? I'll buy it a paintbrush, tell him nobody likes a smart-ass. [ Nina ] I didn't have what you would call a normal upbringing. And that's why it's really important for me that this kid has a shot. I did warn Kevin that we were gonna have to explain to the kid... some day why his grandpa was serving time in Attica. [ Chuckles ] And he got that. I hope he stays this way. You know, there's no way I'm ready to be a father yet, you know. I'm not even sure I've ever seen it done right. My old man was such a prick. But I love Nina, you know, and I'm more afraid of losing her than I am of having a kid with her. We'll probably have a girl, and I'll have to spend the rest of my life... chasing away assholes like me, you know ? [ Kate ] I'm proud of myself. [ Chuckles ] I think it's better that I just be with me... for a while. No baby, no Adam. No Anne. Maybe I'll get a dog. - You sure you got the right address ? - I heard you and Kate broke up. How'd you hear ?Small town. You weren't gonna call me, were you ? I made you a promise. That's what I figured. But you did want to call me, right ? In the worst way. I think I'm all better now. That's what Debra said.[ Chuckling ] I didn't make you any silly promises, did I ?None that I recall. Good. So, um, why are you here ? Well, the one thing I've always been afraid of is getting hurt, and, um, it finally happened. It wasn't so terrible. I'm still alive. So I thought, "Why not take my chances again ?" Okay. But with me ? Well, I... really like you, and, um, I think you really like me. And, um, I just thought that the chances of you... leaving me for Kate twice in a lifetime are pretty slim, right ? Yeah, pretty slim. But then again, the chances of me leaving you for Kate-- [ Giggles ] ♪ Okay ♪ I'm sorry if you feel that way ♪ ♪ Well, all right ♪ I guess I'm gonna have to stay ♪ ♪ So how come I'm sorry ♪ If it doesn't have to take forever ♪ ♪ And no, I don't feel bad ♪ About going home ♪ Excuse me if I ♪ Go astray ♪ Go astray ♪ Go astray ♪ Go astray ♪ What if ♪ Is just a way to get together ♪ ♪ So what ♪ It doesn't have to be forever ♪ ♪ I thought I told you ♪ But I can't remember where or when ♪ ♪ And no, I don't feel good ♪ About losing sleep ♪ Sue me if I ♪ Go astray ♪ Go astray ♪ Go astray ♪ Go astray ♪ And you won't even ♪ Get to see me ♪ 'Cause I'm ♪ I'm miles away ♪ And you can't even ♪ Hope to meet me ♪ 'Cause I've gone astray ♪ Goin' home ♪ Gone astray ♪ Goin' home ♪ Gone astray ♪ Goin' home ♪ Gone astray ♪ Goin' home ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪ Gone astray ♪ Goin' home ♪ Gone astray ♪ Goin' home ♪ Gone astray ♪ Goin' home ♪ Gone astray ♪ Goin' home ♪
