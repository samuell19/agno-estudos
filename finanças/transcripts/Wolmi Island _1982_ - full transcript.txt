Korean Film Wolmi Island! The fearless island, permeated with the exploits of our soldiers, reminds us of the heroic feats of those days. It is many years since the island burned down. But it lives forever in our mind, as an island of the fatherland. In critical days of September 1950, artillery men of the island, equipped only with 4 guns, fought 50,000 enemy troops storming Inchon. Hence the well-known story of Wolmi Island. Who fought there and what did they die for?. Now we call on you to look back on that time! "Wolmi Island" Ung Baek! Ung Baek! It's me, Jong Sop! Why bother me again?. Get up. Come along. I've business with you. Want gasoline to build a fire?. Things are different now. I say no. Come on now, listen. Who are making a noise?. Hush! Let's go out. Why do you want it?. Tomorrow company commander will be moved to battalion as chief of staff. Chief of staff?. Yes. I'm sorry to part with him. I want to serve specials to him but firewood is wet with rain. Give me a few liters. Burn floorboards of the villa. Company commander wouldn't forgive me. He said... if I touch it again, he'll get me court-martialed. What will happen if we are ordered to move?. What?. Move?. The front is... at the Rakdong River. Never mind. Anyway, I can't. - Please... Shall I report it to company commander?. Orderly! - Yes. Go and see what's the sound. - Yes. Help well command platoon leader after I'm gone. Don't worry. Patrol caught two men. What?. O! Comrade officer! - You uncle?.! They're miners. - Are they?. I'm company commander. I'm mining team leader. I've a secret for you. Enemy fleet has come off the coast. How many ships?. - They've covered the sea. We were discovered and 4 of us were killed by them. Got a cigarette?. - I don't smoke. I must go. I'll leave him to see the mine field. He speaks English well. Take good care of him. If the enemy land at Inchon, the main front will be threatened. The enemy is planning to make for Pyongyang. Many things are... ...up to you. I never thought situation would change so rapidly. Hurry up. Never mind. Why do you poke your nose into my business?. You shan't have sausage soup. Did others give you gasoline?. Today we part with the company commander. Ever since our company's birth in March he always lived among us. His tireless efforts made ours a model company. We'll keep this honor. Thank you. But I decided not to leave here. The enemy is thronging here from behind the sea line. Comrades! The fatherland is in danger! We must defend this island... to the last, come what may. Behind us lies the road... to Pyongyang where General Kim Il Sung is. If we fall back, our troops in the front will be surrounded and our beloved parents and brethrens will suffer another disaster. I'll resume... company commander's duty. Comrades! Let's defend Wolmi Island to the last! Let's defend to the last! Company! To arms! Check more carefully. 1st platoon, guard the west. Don't waste shells! The connecting breakwater may be cut any moment. Gun 1... 22 shells?. That's right. Gun 2... 19 shells?. - That's right. Let them come close and hit them at a single shot. My deputy is... command platoon leader. Enemy planes! To positions! Repair the positions quickly! Don't waste water! Water pipe is cut. What has become of the wounded?. They were sent to the rear. Prepare meals right away! - Yes. Why do they make a noise there?. Radio operator Pak Yong Ok has been assigned to your company. You?.! Your age?. - 17. How long trained?. I was a student at a communication school. I don't understand why they've sent you here. This is not a pleasure ground. I've brought a message... that you should hold out the island... for 3 days at all costs. 3 days! Take her to the quarters. He is a hard man, isn't he?. No, he is not hard at heart. Though young, he has tasted many bitters of life. Where do you come from?. - Thongchon. Have you been there?. - No. But I'll go there after the war. Why?. - It's natural. Because... Get away. - Uncle! Dear me! Who are you?. A girl soldier! She's a radio operator. - Really?. Give her a good treatment. - Of course. Do you like cold soup?. - Yes, I do. OK. Come on later. You shall have special dishes. Yun Sik, here... My neck is breaking. Is he a cook?. Yes. He is a humorist. Once he served cold cucumber soup... mixed in wine, so... the whole company got drunk. How?. He bragged it was good... against sweltering heat. And the colonel was coming. The whole company jumped into the river, and stayed there for two hours. MacArthur's 50, 000-strong army will soon attack us. It will be a hard battle. Is it possible... to check the enemy attack with four guns?. What do we need to win?. Reinforcements?. The unit gave us all it could. But they are too small... Apple flowers bloom white in spring Golden rice ears undulate in autumn O, a handful of earth of my native green fields I know it is dearer than my life. What's this?. Want to die all in one place at a time hit by shells?. Take positions! Radio operator, put off your white uniform! Master-gunner of Gun No. 3, stay. The others may do so. But not you, Party cell chief. I didn't foresee bombings. You should. We're too few. I know, company commander! So, all are strained. It's the first battle. They may tremble for fear. Yong Ok's song... reminds them of their homes. They try... to be bolder before her... who reflects their parents, wives and children. Without this spirit we can't fight MacArthur. Give me a cigarette. What schooling did you have?. - I'd no schooling. It happened when General Kim Il Sung visited our mine. Cadres of the mine told him they found it hard to fulfill the plan... for lack of equipment. The General said, if the workers are aroused they will do it and... man is decisive, more important than equipment. May I go back?. - Yes. May I come in?. - Yes. Private Kim Jung Sop has brought you a meal. Oh my, I'm about to go. You should take a meal in time... I couldn't bring cold soup for lack of water. But, for you... How did you join the army so young?. Not me alone. All my classmates teased to join the army. Embarrassed by my tears, they received me. Good. Where did you learn the song?. Soldiers taught me. Won't you teach it to me?. Song?. - Yes. I'm the best member of the company chorus. They say my voice is good. My daughter, too, is an excellent art circle member. Will you see her picture?. Pretty! She's very clever. I believe in my daughter. Though, a peasant's daughter, she, too. can make a name, why not?. I feel I'm seeing her. I mustn't bring shame on her. When will you fight, engaged in cooking?. You don't know. It's just my duty. Even if my flesh is torn to shreds and ground to powder... I must prepare meals for the company. Enemy planes! Company, to arms! Gun 1 is calling. - Tell them to take it easy. Let them come close! Let me fight, too. Go to Gun 2! - Yes. Uncle! What are you doing there?. Fishing. - What?. Look at these fishes frightened by the bombing. Are you mad?. Under this rain of bombs?. What matters?. This is my duty... O, another bomb's falling. Lie down! Company commander! Order us to fire! Let them come closer! Company commander! May we shoot?. Let them come a little closer! Company commander! Why don't you order us to fire?. Company commander! Let them come a little closer! Company commander! Fire! Go to Gun 3! Shoot the second one. It's the flag ship. Phone operator, go to the shelter! I'll go to Gun 2. Come along! Medic! Master-gunner! You're bleeding. Never mind. Take your position! Keep firing. Master-gunner! - Min Guk! Who's he?. - The pointer of Gun 3. Take him to the shelter. - Yes. Comrades, we must sink the destroyer at the head. Target is the destroyer, armor-piercing shells! Back sight 8! - Aiming finished! Load quickly! - Loading finished! Death to the US imperialists! Fire! Told! - Company commander, it told! All right. Keep firing! Another shell told! - The shells hit the target! Hurrah! Hurrah! Bravo! What's up with them?. Gone out of wits?. Each trying to flee first. If only we had enough shells... - Really. Cowards! They're fleeing! Company commander, I feel hungry. - Me, too. The cook promised a fish soup... Really?. - Yes. Uncle! Do you cry?. Don't. I'll be alright soon. I have to give meals to company commander and others now. I must get up. Don't talk. Never mind. Visit my native village some day... It's placed by a riverside. Perhaps rice harvesting has begun now. My paddy field is down the riverside. The General gave it to me, a former farm hand. I know I could never repay it at all cost. So I did my best, but... My wife, too, knows it. I hope she'll bring up my Yong Hui well... to repay the General's favors for me... If you meet them later, tell them what I have said. Are the company commander ... and all others well?. Oh... I'm thirsty... - Wait a moment. Uncle... Water... Uncle! Uncle! We've suffered a big loss. Many comrades... Min Guk was sent unconscious to the hospital. What?. Let's say goodbye to the dead. I see. Sank or destroyed 2 destroyers, and 6 big and small vessels. Two guns were destroyed and many lives lost. Send us armor-piercing shells. Glory to the fallen heroes! Comrades! Today we are parting with them forever. We will remember for what they laid down their lives. Our posterity will tell: They fought to the last drop of their blood to defend the country liberated by General Kim Il Sung. We'll never forget them. Goodbye, comrades! Thae Un! Thank you. Thae Un! Splendid! Battalion commander! I lost half the company. I know. What're you doing there?. You ought to send us shells if not reinforcements. Don't get excited. Soldiers may overhear us. I'm sorry. We can hardly come here because of the enemy's fire. The breakwater was cut. I've brought only 4 boxes of shells. Even this caused us some casualties. You have to hold out for 2 days... even without reinforcements. Can you?. I will. - Thanks! I thought you would. I called out the 6th company, but don't count on it. The situation there is tense as well. Every hour you win here will rescue tens of thousand of our soldiers in the Rakdong River front. Remember?. You won an accordion in the art competition of the unit. Then your company sang: You'd lay down your lives for the motherland. Motherland! Once I read a book. It said: The dear land where our forefathers lived through generations and larks sing over the fields, that's motherland. What do you think of it?. I feel something missing. So do I. Our ancestors lived on this land and larks sang here, too, long since. But was it of any significance before the General liberated our country?. I toiled a slave labor in my native village. So did you. Then, what does our motherland mean?. It means precisely our General. I think so. So do I. What then does it mean to offer our lives to the motherland?. It means devoting our lives to the General. We're far away from him. But let's defend here in the spirit of guarding him. Understood. We'll never yield the road leading to Pyongyang. Please call on Uncle Min Guk. I'm anxious of him. Heavy work makes me miss veteran Party members. I see. Any other request?. No. I trust you. Today we received 4 boxes of shell. But tomorrow there may be no more supply. We have to hold out here for 48 hours from now. But with few shells and exhausted men... What shall be done?. What are you thinking of?. Of my native home. Is it Sok Jun?. - Yes. What's the matter?. A mine came floating near. I kept it in safety. Your mission is over now. Won't you go back?. I'll, after the battle. You'll need me. Listen! We must defend this island 2 days more. You mean till the 15th?. Yes. Tomorrow's battle will be harder. Miner! We need music now. Play the accordion. What?. Aren't they all asleep?. No. They are lost in thought. Too tired. I see. What shall I play?. Yong Ok's favorite song. Sing. Apple flowers bloom white in spring. Golden rice ears undulate in autumn O, a handful of earth of my native green fields I know it is dearer than my life. The glow over the burning trenches Reminds me of my dear home village O, the hill with blooming wild flowers on I know it's my sole dear motherland. Dead or alive, we're in your embrace I call you with boundless emotion O, my country that is called mother, I know it's the embrace of the General. You are from Is. Wolmi?. Yes. May I ask you?. - Please. The company commander there is Ri Thae Un, isn't it?. You know him?. Yes. I know him from prewar days. Then you're from the Medical University... Did he tell you of me?. - Yes. Maybe, he was angry with me. No, he blames no one. He said he'd been refused by a girl for his bad character. You said he was rude?. Of course I know little of your relations. But you should've known why he is rude. He began pulling a cart at 9. At 14 he worked as a stoker for a locomotive. He suffered hard labor from his early years. Why don't you understand it?. He's a real man. That's why he could hold out there. Wasn't he wounded?. Pure gold doesn't burn even in flames. Surgeon, you're wanted. Thank you very much for telling me about him. Enemy! The "Kirk" is coming tomorrow. Famous Colonel Andrew is its captain. He gave MacArthur his pledge of victory. I advise you to surrender. Then you shall be saved. Shut up! You are the aggressors who came across the seas. MacArthur said so. I know nothing else and I need not to. Let me ask you a thing. Don't you like sparrow dish?. It's a fashion in your country?. Tell him to see his fill how we strike MacArthur before he's escorted. September 14 I'll stay here though the wireless set broke. I can keep phone connections and cook here. No, leave here. I'll take the place of the uncle for revenge. We don't depend others for our revenge. Others?. - Yes. Me?. - Leave this island. Let me stay here with the company soldiers. They're all braving death... Death?. Who will die?. We're fighting to live more fruitfully. I'm busy. Get away. Never mind. We'll call her back when battle is over. But she must leave now. Understand?. - Yes. See her off. Don't think ill of him. No, not at all. Are you angry?. Why does he hate me?. Hate?. I know he loves the country best. But he is cold-hearted. You know nothing of him. Cold-hearted?. He's very sorry to part with you. He thinks you're so dear to the company. Think he's sending you as he hates you?. Why don't you understand him?. You may think me anyway. But... don't forget he's very nice. Good-bye! Did you bring the prisoner?. - Yes. Which's the "Kirk"?. It's not in sight. That is No. 729. Where is it then?. Fire! Why is Gun 4 silent?. Gun 4! Gun 4! Gun 4! A destroyer is cruising... round the lateral coast. Medic! Why are you here again?. Why are you back?. You've turned up at last! Operator, call out Gun 4. Gun 4! Look back. There's the "Kirk". Gun 4!... Gun 4! I'll repair lines. Hurry! - Yes. Gun 4. is calling. Gun 4?. A destroyer is stalking you. Turn back the gun and fire! An enemy destroyer is approaching from behind. An enemy destroyer is approaching. Fire! Told! Hurrah! - It told! Yong Ok has come. I saw her, too. Where is she?. Yong Ok! Yong Ok! Battalion commander, a phone call for you. What?. 6th Company's been cut short?. By air-raid?. I shouldn't do this. The last third-day-battle is ahead. I should get up. Soldiers are looking at me... Ah, water! If only I could drink some cold water... What are you doing?. - I'm writing to my home. Though I know it'd never be mailed... Why not?. Write letters, everybody. Let's write our devotion to the motherland. Comrades! Now we have only a gun and 16 shells. We should fight one day more. My decision is this. We'll pull the gun to the open area. We'll go out to fire the gun in twos, not in all. If first two fall down, next two men will go out. I'm a miner. I'm strange to the gun. Let me take a man. We two will attack the enemy warships with the mine on a raft. Sok Jun! Company commander! Company commander, let me go! Company commander, I'll go. Thank you, comrades! - Company commander! Comrades! Company commander! - Uncle Min Guk! What's up?. - Company commander! How's your condition?. - Not bad. A small bruise. How could you come in such condition through the fire?. No one has come since yesterday. I also thought I couldn't see you again. I've barely managed to come. Why should you come at the risk of your life?. You know well the situation here. I know. So I've come. I'm a Party member, you know. Master-gunner! Where's Yong Ok?. Where's the cook?. Glory to fallen heroes! I'm going. Any message?. Nothing particular. If possible, tell them a sailor... wished the General good health before going out to fight. The gangsters invading our land The US imperialists are our sworn enemy Comrades, punish them in the name of our motherland For the leader, for the Party Go to life-and-death battle Beat the enemy. No enemy in the world Can bring us to our knees Comrades, crush US imperialism in the name of justice For the leader, for the Party Go to life-and-death battle Beat the enemy. Terrible people! My dear friend Robert! Seriously wounded, I write this in my last moment. I've watched these people for 3 days. MacArthur branded them invaders. That's a lie. The invaders are Americans... I've never seen such true men as these people who love their motherland so much. We can't beat them. America may can win a battle but not war. MacArthur'll suffer the shame of defeat all his life. Curse to MacArthur! Important news for you. I saw her. Who do you mean?. Once you told me... - Where?. In Inchon. She's an army surgeon. Is she?. She said she would wait for you through life. She is always thinking of you. She'd wait even if you were dead. She couldn't come to the station when you left for the front. She was at a meeting for joining the army. Thanks. Give me a cigarette. How beautiful! Such are Korean women. I won't regret even if I die now. They say a life devoted for happiness is dearer than that enjoying it. You're right. I regret nothing. We could say... we lived a worthy life for our country. Yes. - I remember Yong Ok's song. I... I know... Uncle, we've won in the end, haven't we?. Yes. MacArthur who boasts his victory... for 50 years, was beaten up for 3 days, by a lieutenant of the People's Army. Perhaps he's feeling a great pain. Who will take the letters?. Yun Sik will. He's your orderly. He's the youngest. Let him enjoy happiness for us. I won't go... for such letters. Don't think they are merely letters. This is our company's last greeting of to the fatherland. Go! Give this... to battalion commander. Understood. I'll surely be back. I washed your towel. Water the flower, please. - See. Go. Yun Sik! Take this. - This, too. Understood. Death-defying corps, to arms! Goodbye! - Bye! It's time for parting now. Smoke it out. Company commander! Pardon me for my mistake if any. No, I'm glad we are together at this last moment. Company commander! Company commander, then... 1st group, come along! 2nd group, start! Master-gunner! - Please! "To Battalion Commander!" Battalion commander! We are 12 in all with a gun now. We've defended the island for 3 days as ordered. The enemy will soon attack again. If there's no gun-reports from Wolmi Island, Fire at us. We'll die, but never kneel down. Long live General Kim Il Sung! May ye, motherland prosper! "The shore battery men of Wolmi Island fought well. They fought bravely to the last men to ensure the strategic retreat of the People's Army as ordered by the Supreme HQs, and checked enemy's landing for 3 days. We cannot forget their heroic services."
