andydexin ==== NORM TEAM ==== TLF I want to propose a toast. Today is a very special day\nfor me... ...so Im nervous,\nand I wrote down my speech. A toast to the kindest, most gentle... ...and most wonderful man\nin the world: Papa. Thank you for making my dream\ncome true. And now maybe lets dance. Stop. Hes okay. - Hey! What are you doing? - Sorry. Im so sorry. Ill get more towels. Be right back. Ivan Borisovich? Ivan Borisovich! The boss is down!\nThe hitters dressed like a waiter! Cover all exits! Cover all exits! Sasha! Sasha!\nHes heading your way! Sasha! Sasha, you hear me? Sasha? You told me\ntherell be no loose ends. - We got it down to one. - Who? Flint. You have access to the best\ntechnology... ...and yet a man with a comatose\nwife in tow can elude you for-- For how many years now? This is what he does best,\nand he is the best. Hes also the only one outside\nthis room who can bury us. Okay, guys, look, lets think. Is Flint really that much\nof a problem? I mean, look, if he shows,\nwe can easily take him out. You had a good idea to start.\nGet rid of the bad guys. Hire professionals for the job.\nFine. I backed you. But then you two idiots got greedy\nselling weapons back to criminals. Hey, you got your share. Shut up. The U.N. hearings\nabout this whole mess of yours... ...start at the end of the month. If theres any fallout,\nany problem whatsoever... ...I promise I will land this clusterfuck\nsquarely on your shoulders. And you both will spend the rest\nof your natural lives behind bars. Okay. We get it. For your sake, I hope you do. Because I hear they just love\ncute, dirty cops in prison. - Asshole. - But hes a smart asshole. And hell waste no time burying us\nto protect himself. - So, what do we do? - Find Flint. Take him out. How? He was the best on our payroll. - You said so yourself. - We use bait. You mean Polo. We pay off the Ukrainians,\nrelease Polo, put a price on his head. What makes you think Flintll show? Its personal, hes obsessed.\nLets use that. Its our only play. Good morning, Mr. Flint. Ive got the morning shift\nat the clinic. Hang on, Mrs. Pavlescu. I just wanted to give you this. Oh, thank you.\nYou are much too kind. - As always. - Please. Anna and I... We owe you a lot more than that. Honestly, I dont know\nwhat wed do without you. - Have a good day. - Thank you. Oh, almost forgot. I was getting groceries yesterday... ...and Gabi at the store\nsaid there was a man in town. - What man? - A foreigner. Hes staying at the motel. I thought youd like to know. Okay, thanks, Mrs. Pavlescu. Bye. How did you find me? - Good to see you too. - How did you find me? Im not gonna ask you again. It was just a hunch. Theres no way\nI could have been followed. Anna... Anna told me how much you two loved\ncoming up here when you first met. Ive been driving through every village\nbetween here and the Austrian border. What do you want? - Theres a job. - Im out of the business. - Tickets a million. - I dont need the money. I see you again... ...Im sending you home in a box. Targets Polo. Hes being released. Released? The Ukrainians are letting him go. Im willing to bet he either out a deal\nor snitched on someone. Whatever. - Or hes bait. - For you? New administration.\nMaybe Interpol cleaning house. They still want their money back.\nI mean, you did-- Roland, dont. Why not? Because I wasnt followed.\nBecause Im not setting you up. I just thought we could make\na few bucks together, you know? Turn on the music. - What? - The radio. Louden Roland, come on. Close your eyes. - Youve been in these woods too long. - Close your eyes now. Roland, think about\nwhat youre doing, man. Just think about it, will you? I mean, Im not setting you up.\nAll these years I didnt say nothing. I mean, come on, man, just think.\nWeve got a history here. Roland? Welcome, my friend. The Russian project\nwent perfectly. The Bulgarians send their thanks. - Chocolate? - Too fattening. Very well, but I have goodies\nyou cannot refuse. Your usual.\nSouth African, special cut. Todays value exactly... The clients are extremely happy. I aim to please. And even better news,\nanother potential contract. Double your usual fee. Whos the mark? Polo Yakur. A well-connected\ngentleman of some reputation. Hes in prison. - It will be a difficult job. - Hes being released today. Ill have more details shortly. - And the client? - Wishes to remain anonymous. Ill take it. I was hoping youd say that. I wonder if one day youll feel\nyouve made enough money... ...to move to a better neighborhood. I like my neighborhood. People mind their own business. Of course. Hey, boys. Welcome home. Wheres my brother? - - - Sorry, boss. He got picked up. - When? Last week.\nSome guy talked too much. Lets drive. Roland. Roland. Roland, help. Roland! Roland. Roland. Roland. Roland, help! Roland. Roland. Bullshit. When Im back all this shit\nbetter be inside, unpacked. And youd better be dressed\nto go to work, understand? Do you understand? Hey, how you doing? Were your new neighbors.\nOctober and me. That your place? Yeah. See, Im looking\ninto expanding my business... ...and Im thinking\nabout buying the whole oor. Id make it worth your while, huh? I doubt it. What the fuck you looking at?\nMove the boxes. - Hello. - its me. I want in. - Ill take the Polo job. - its off the market. A million bucks\nis a tough ticket to keep open. I dont care about the money. Just get me the intel,\nmaybe some gear. Its a bad idea. We dont want to get\nin someones way. This type of money,\ntheres serious people involved. Culley. You owe me. Look, Im sorry\nfor looking for you, all right? Just lay low. Youre safe. Annas safe. How long is that gonna last? I took out half his outfit\nand put Polo away. Hes gonna come after me\nto finish the job. No, its better if I hit him first. Come on, man.\nI need your help here. All right, all right. - You can come stay here. - Thats good. - See you soon. - Yeah. I should have my head examined. Here. Looks like\nPolos brother, Danzo... ...is gonna walk\nat the trial tomorrow. The prosecutions witness\nis mysteriously missing. Thats our shot. Now, if were lucky,\nPolo comes to get him in person. Okay, lets leak it out. Good idea. Flintll have\nhis ears to the ground. My sources say our friend\nmight be visiting... ...a downtown courthouse tomorrow. Checkmate. You are full of surprises, my friend. Municipal courthouse. Yup. - How goods the intel? - Solid. Double-blind, the usual. Could be your old friends\nfrom Interpol. Sure you wanna go through with it? Dont worry about me, Mom. Ive done this once or twice before. You see something you like? Danzo. Danzo. Danzo. Can you hear me? Look at me. Look at me, Danzo.\nDanzo. Shooter in the van.\nShooter in the van. The motherfucker shot my brother. Please settle down. What the fuck you mean\n"settle down"? Fuck. Danzo. Careful. Watch his head. Come on. Wheres the ambulance? Come on. Come on. Gun. GO, go! Stop. Hey you, freeze. - Stop, stop, StOP- - Stop, stop. Move, move, move. - Were dead. - No, were not. Its working. We drew Flint out. - You dont think we spooked him? - You see his face? Weve got him hooked.\nHe wont quit till Polos dead. We need more guns, hardware. - We cant do this alone. - Good point. Time to call Herrod. I talked to the doctor. It was poison-tipped.\nVery fast-acting. He said whoever did this\nknows his toxins. Keep it safe... ...so when I find the animal\nthat killed my brother... ...I can use it to carve out his eyes. I dont believe in fairy tales. The minute they told me\nI was being released... ...I smelled something rotten. I dont think either\nthe sniper that missed... ...or Robin Hood\nwas there by coincidence. Maybe you should lay low.\nWe could be on a boat tonight. Im not going anywhere\nuntil I find who killed Danzo. Come on, we have work to do. Now we know it was a setup. Ill make calls,\nhave you out of the country by tonight. - Ill handle it. - No. Find out if Polos cousin\nstill owns those factories by the docks. You sure about that? - Yeah. - All right. Ill make some calls. Nobody talks shit to me. You always got something to say. Talk some more shit to me.\nStupid bitch. - Stop it. - Thats enough. You still got something to say? Youre disturbing me. Go and cool off. Go. You Okay? No. Excuse me. Im trying to practice. Im locked out. Sit. Put this on. It will help. - Hello? - Despite your unforeseen difficulties... -...the contract remains open. - Wait. Dont move. Stay there. Okay? There was another shooter.\nI thought it was exclusive. It is. The client has confirmed\nthat a third party may be involved. A third party with personal issues. I also have a possible location\nfor our polo-playing friend. You need to leave now. Im locked out. You can wait in the hallway. Please. Come on, you have to go now. Please, can I stay here\njust for tonight? Come on, out. Itll take him till tomorrow\nto calm down. He sees me now,\nhell put me in the hospital again. You need to be gone\nin the morning, okay? And dont touch anything. The Polo contract is mine.\nExclusive. I dont care about the money.\nIts personal. You lose me my fee,\nits personal to me. Sure those antiques still work? - One way to find out. - Youre the guy from the courthouse. - Blocked my shot. - You made me miss. Touch. Look, were both professionals. Sure we can come to some sort\nof understanding. What I understand\nis youre getting in my way. Exactly my point.\nWe keep chasing the same target... ...well keep getting\nin each others way. Then stay out of it. After that mess at the courthouse,\nPolos gonna be on full guard. The best way for us to get him\nis if we work together. You get the money\neither way, pal. All right? The whole million.\nAnd a free pair of hands. Nothing in life is for free.\nWhats in it for you? I got history with Polo. Oh, great. A partner with a vendetta. Just what I need. Youll never find him. I will. Ive been doing this\nfor a long time, my friend. Oh, youll find him eventually.\nIll find him tonight. Like I said, I got history with Polo. I spent two years of my life\ninfiltrating his crew. Hes never gonna come back here. He will sever all his usual contacts\nexcept for one. - Who? - We got a deal? If your intels for real.\nWhos your lead? The guy who makes his hardware. Polo loves his toys. I read about these things. Very cool. Careful. 50 Careful, thats a half-a-million-dollar\npiece of equipment. Spoken like a true businessman. But the question\nyou should be asking... ...is whether the weapon is loaded. Wait, wait, wait. No, dont. God, okay. Hey. Okay. What do you want? Holy shit. Roland Flint. You remember me, thats good. And you know what I want. Youre the one who called. - So theres no job? - Quit stalling. I have no idea where he is. You know, I read these things\ncan even memorize a pattern. No, no, stop. Hey, stop.\nNo, hey. Stop. All right, all right. Calm down.\nIm not gonna kill you. Just gonna blow you apart\nlimb by limb. Please, I have a family. I had a family too, you piece of shit. Okay, okay, hey. Ill tell you. Talk fast. Ill tell you. He knows hes got a price\non his head. Hes moving around hotels\nhe once used as a front. - Give me an address. - I dont know where he is right now. But Thursday and Friday\nhell be at the Royal Grand. If youre lying to me... I understand. I know what you do.\nPlease. Good. What the hell was that? What the hell was what? Why did you kill him?\nI wanted the guy alive. I had a plan. I was gonna introduce you.\nHe was gonna run off to Polo... ...with a line on the guy\nthat killed his brother... ...and I was gonna use that\nto lure him in. You didnt tell me that. Because it was a new idea,\nall right? I was thinking on the fly. If you want a partner... ...youve got to learn\nhow to communicate better. You know, youre lucky\nwe have a lead. - You trust him? - As much as I trust you. Ill get my people\nto confirm his info, okay? Yeah, you do that. Ill get\nthe layout for the Royal Grand. Well meet, figure it out. You know, we should just take that. Probably better to make it look\nlike a break-in anyway. Can we take something lighter? What? I reached out to a guy\nat the courthouse. Got this off a security camera. Get this out to everybody.\nI mean everybody. Lets find this fucker and bury him. Wake up. - Come on. Get out. - Sorry. You left the door open.\nI saw the fruit. L got hungry- Okay, you ate, you slept.\nNow youre going out. Come on. Come on. Get out. - Get out. - Fine. What are you doing? Have a good life, turtle. How did you do that? - Do what? - How did you get him to come out? Come here. Ill show you. You just have to pet him right here. Amazing. Wait. You should put something\non your back. It hurt? What? Go get Anna. Get out of the country. Better yet, go to the States. I gotta see this through. You gotta see it through? Or you wanna be the one\nwho pulls the trigger? I mean, you said this other\nguys good, right? Good. Hes got the contract.\nHes a pro, hes motivated. Let him take care of Polo. Its not just Polo though, is it? Its those dirty Interpol cops that set\nme up. They want my head on a stick. They want their money back. Theyre\ngonna keep coming till they get it. So, what are you gonna do?\nYou take them all on? Youre insane. You can sit there\ninsulting me or you can help. Whats it gonna be? All right. What? Im going to bed. You coming up? In a minute. I know you like\nto keep your hands clean. But I promise... ...if you dont get your pit bulls off my\nback, Im gonna come back here. Ill carve your wifes heart out\nand make you eat it. Understand? Im not... No, youre not listening. - Goodbye. - Dont. In my home! He threatened me in my own home\nwith my family upstairs! Well, hes just trying\nto psych you out. You want resources, fine. Ill give you extra men,\nweapons, whatever. But I want him dead.\nI dont care what it takes. Or I will personally turn\nthe two of you in. You know, maybe the problem\nwith our plan is that... ...Polo isnt in on it. You wanna make that headcase\nour partner? Ive been expecting you. You Nalbandian? At your service. I want to know who\nthe players are. Who set it up. Who the hitters are. Everything. And I know that you know. Lets imagine\nthat you are right. Now what? Now you tell me\nbefore I start hurting you. Your reputation is well-deserved. So is mine. Gentlemen. Agent Godfrey. I see that your schemes\narent getting any smarter. Which is why we need your help. Really? Why would I help you? Immunity. Lifetime guarantee... ...by both the E.U.\nand the U.S. governments. No strings attached\nexcept a one-way ticket... ...to anywhere outside\nof Europe and North America. In exchange for...? Helping to intercept Roland Flint. Flint. Things begin to make\na little more sense. Its a limited-time offer.\nWe need to know. Now. - One condition. - What? I want the man\nwho killed my brother. Impossible. Unless the price is right. You feel better? I guess I got new Tellys now. What? My scars. I name them after the man\nwho gave them to me. Youre judging me. Like youre so much better. Would you kill me if someone\noffered you enough money? What do you want? Nothing. People choose their death\nwhen they choose how they live. Does that let you sleep at night? I sleep fine. Im a weapon. I dont choose where Im pointed. Of course. You just follow orders. Im not different\nthan a doctor or a waiter. I serve a function. I get it. Im in the service industry too. You calling me a whore? A service provider. Actually Im nothing like you. I dont have a choice.\nI have nothing and no one. You have money, power. You can get out of the life\nanytime you want. You choose not to. Im going out. Hey. You cost me business. Shes done with you. You dont want me as an enemy. I bet that scares the girls. Who is he? Some guy we found snooping\naround, asking about you. I dont think hes a cop. Who are you? Santa Claus. Oh, good. A comedian. Once more. Who are you? Are you deaf? Im Santa Claus. Deaf. Whats going on? We have a new offer. The client will double your usual fee\nfor a fraction of the work. What you need to do\nis bring your new friend... ...to a specific place\nat a specific time. It will never work. - He will smell the trap. - Polo would be there as an incentive. You will lead him in.\nPut him at ease. Thats all you have to do.\nOnce it starts, youre out. Its good to have friends. But this is a dangerous friend\nto have. Hes a loose cannon.\nFor him, its personal. Flint did a lot of damage\nto Polos organization. But his mistake was leaving\nthe snakes head for last. Polo got Flint where it hurt most. Family. Wanted to send a strong\nmessage to his enemies. So he made Flint watch... ...while he and his men\ngang-raped his wife... ...and beat her into a coma. Lucky for your new friend, the local\ngendarmes had a tail on Polo... ...and intervened\nbefore Flint was killed. Then Flint vanished. Along with a sizable chunk\nof lnterpols dirty money. So this whole job on Polo\nis a smoke screen. Its dirty cops using Polo\nas bait to get Mr. Flint, right? The money is real. A third now. The rest on completion. Good. I was worried Mr. Flints\npersonal vendetta was infectious. - Where do I take him? - City hall. Tomorrow, 9:00. City hall tomorrow at 9:00. My source says Polos meeting\na councilman hes got on his payroll. Trust your source? As much as I trust you. - I worry about you. - What? Im worried\nbecause for you its personal. You care too much. Its going to get you dead.\nMaybe me too. Ask yourself this: If you never really cared about\nanyone or anything... ...then were you ever really alive? You sound like someone I know. Yeah, city halls good. The only way in is through the main\nlobby. Lots of high vantage points. - I like it. - Okay. Lets take a look. Here you go. Ill take it. Cheers. Do you ever pray? Been a long time. No one answered. I gave HP- Thats sad. Where I come from, priests\nand crooks, theyre all the same. Do you dream? No. Ever think about your future? No, it will come soon enough.\nAnd you? I just want out. Out of the city. Out of the life. With someone I can trust. Trust to do what? Light a candle for me\nwhen Im gone. Our selection for the evening. Im busy. I think you wanna see this. I need the room. Please. You dont trust the African\nto come through. So I got us a backup. Our friend here runs girls\nfor Benny Black in the district. He saw the picture. He says he\nknows the guy with the crossbow. You know the animal\nthat killed my brother? Yes, sir. Were neighbors. Wait. Be careful. Excuse me, whats going on here? Police, madam. Police. The situations under control.\nYou can step back into your office. Get back into your office. You can come quietly,\nor I can use this again, okay? Move it. Your fat friend tried to hold out. He really did. But finally... ...he sang like a fucking soprano. Told me all about you\nand your little country hideaway. Who knows?\nMaybe I pay our girl a visit. Excellent work. The client is very pleased. Youre not going to examine them? I trust you. I have another prospect. Im going to take some time off. Hello? My friend. Its for you. - Hello. - Your friend has been a lovely hostess. Here she is. I hear you are a hard man. But even hard men like us\nhave something we care about. For example... ...I loved my brother very much. The brother that you murdered. I suggest an exchange. You for her. You dont really have a choice. As a wise man once said: We are all prisoners\nof our own passions. Youre wrong about me. Im not a prisoner of anything. He wanted to gamble. I told him it was impossible\nto get to you. You went behind my back. -Its done between you and I. - Oh, come. Youre overreacting. If I overreacted, youd be dead. Tell me where the money is\nand Ill make it quick. Just let me go right now.\nYoull never see me again. And if we dont? Then Ill fucking kill you. Easy. Lets get our money back first. Okay, last chance. Now, Gabor here, hes an expert. He can make this last quite a while. Wheres the money? I dont know\nwhat youre talking about. Hes expecting you? I was hoping youd reconsider. I need to know\nwhere they took Flint. Youre breaking your own code. Risking your life\nbecause of feelings. If I dont feel, am I really alive? And all this time,\nI thought I understood you. You and I understand\neach other perfectly. We speak the same language. I need to know where Flint is.\nWere losing time. I dont want payment. I do this in hopes\nof repairing our partnership. Which Im certain will have\na long and profitable future. If memory serves me correctly,\nMr. Polo suggested... ...his cousins old factory as a suitable\nplace to question Mr. Flint. Wheres the money? Roland. Roland. Roland, help! 0K8)- Wheres the money?\nI wont ask again. Its where? Spent it. Finish it. Gabor. Gabor. - Shit. - Okay, hold it together. Just hold it together. - You go check that way. - Im not going out there. - What? - Im not going out there. What? Jesus Chri-- Okay, do something\nuseful then, yeah? Take care of-- Come out now,\nor Ill shoot him right here. Show yourself or I swear to God\nIll blow his fucking head off. Should have let me be. You set me up. It was a mistake. I came back. Yeah, you did. - Yes. - Sorry to interrupt, sir. Still no word. - Keep trying. - its Flint, isnt it? They went to finish him\nand now theyre missing. Its no concern of yours. Oh, no, I think Mr. Flint\nis a shared concern of ours. We have both caused him\na great deal of grief. And left to his own devices... ...he will stop at nothing\nto return the favor... ...to both of us. What can you do\nthat were not already doing? AK Youre pretty good with the AK. Thought you were more\nof a knife man. - Use the best tool for the job. - You got that right. It was one of yours, actually. - Hello? - Mrs. Pavlescu, its me, its Roland. I need you to get Anna\nout of the house now. What? Hello? Hello? Line was cut. Hello? - Turn around. - Okay. - Hello? - Goodbye. They drew the curtains. Cutting off lines of sight. At least two at the front. All right, were gonna have\nto draw them out. Grenades. My wifes in there. I guess Im not too good\nwith hostage situation. Welcome home, Mr. Flint.\nCheck your webcam. So beautiful. Dont you fucking touch her. What? Connection not too good. Im gonna make this real simple. If you and your friend... ...first, I will let each of my men\ntake turns with her. Then Ill let you watch\nwhile I skin her alive. And if that doesnt wake her up,\nnothing will. What do you want to do? The thing about fairy tale endings... ...is that theyre bullshit. You got me. Just leave her alone. I tell you what. I do her last. That way you dont have\nto watch this time. I have money. No money\ncan bring my brother back. But you will pay in a different way. And slowly. Bullshit. Show him. I got 10 times more hidden inside. Bullshit. You let me leave\nand Ill show it to you. - What the hell are you doing? - What? What the hell is this? Thats life. Thats life? Thats fucking life? Thats my wife over there. Youre telling me thats fucking life? Wait. Hes yours. Get up. Now beg. Fuck you. - Beg. - No. Beg her. Please forgive me. You can do better than that.\nLouden Forgive me! - Again. - Please forgive me! Thats good. Theres just one problem. She cant hear you. Im sorry, sweetheart. Im sorry. Its over. Not yet. Theres no guarantee of success.\nIts a new procedure. And it is quite expensive. Oh, dont worry about that. Ive got the money. Okay, then,\nwe should start right away. I just want out. Out of the city. Out of the life. With someone I can trust. Trust to do what? Light a candle for me\nwhen Im gone.
