[♪♪♪] Alex, your little boy's here. He doesn't usually summon us on such short notice, sir. Ryder, at my father's age, everything has to be on short notice... Oh, Father, how very nice to see you, sir. Oh, you're looking wonderful, sir. [COUGHING] Isn't he, Ryder? Oh, yes, sir. Yes, sir. Ah, George, I see you still haven't found a way of making an honest living. [SCOFFS] Alex. [MEOWS] Mr. Hollingsworth has asked you here for a little clarification. Yes? Expenses. Eighty-five thousand dollars for flying lessons? Well, I had to buy what was left of the plane. GEORGE: And what about your recent foray into the sport of kings? Spending money on racehorses? Is it my fault my stud decided to jump over a barb wire fence? I mean, he didn't neuter himself on purpose, you know. [LAUGHS] Your father thinks you have a spending problem. I'm a Hollingsworth. Your father feels that you have been living too long on his largesse, wasting your life, systematically squandering every dollar that you've been given. Well, I suppose my second wife squandered a bit, but... Nevertheless, your father has added a codicil to his will that precludes you from any inheritance. I'm out of the will? Irrevocably. But your father has the highest hope that this action will inspire you to go out and do something with your life. Is it something I said? Despite all, your father trusts... [MEOWS] ...that you are resourceful enough to survive. Resourceful? I'm broke. But not homeless. Your father is giving you full title to the yacht. The Invincible? Do you have any idea how much it costs to keep a vessel like that in the water? And you may have Ryder as long as he takes care of the cat. The cat, sir? GEORGE: You know how fond Mr. Hollingsworth is of Pinky. [YOWLING] [COUGHING] It's a shame he's so allergic. Well, doctor's orders, I'm afraid. No more cat. But you have a job, Ryder, as long as Pinky lives. Oh, a generous provision, sir... [PINKY CONTINUES YOWLING] [♪♪♪] ALEX: Hey. Where's he going? Wait a minute. VERONICA: Alex, don't you think you were a little hard on him? No, Veronica, he'll find some way of staying afloat... [CHUCKLES] [♪♪♪] [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] Yes, sir. Your usual table, Mr. Nelson. Thank you, Paul. ALEX: Look, Chester, if you'd just give my bank a call, I'm sure they'll tell you I'm quite solid. CHESTER: There's no more money in your account, Mr. Hollingsworth. Hello, Arthur. Would you please tell Chester I'm good for the money? He's good for the money, Chester. [GRUNTS] He's on the club board. Thank you, Arthur. RYDER: Oh, oh, come back here, you disgusting feline. Keep that up, and I'll have you declawed. [PINKY YOWLING, HISSING] Mr. Nelson might be on the board, but I run the club. If you can pay your slip fees, everything will be... Chester, have I ever let you down? How about the last month, and the month before that? I'm ashamed to say this, but I too am not immune to the effects of the recession. Let me give you my watch. The one you gave to the pool boy and the dock master turned their wrists green. By the end of the quarter, when the dividends come through, I'll settle up everything. This is the end of the quarter. Did I say end of the quarter? I meant end of the fiscal year. [PINKY YOWLS] RYDER: Come here, you furball. Pinky, where are you? Ryder, what happened to your face? Pinky wasn't happy at the thought of his flea bath. Did-did you-- Did you see him headed this way? If you don't need me, sir, I-- I think I'll go and look for him. Well, check the café. I think today's special is the tuna surprise. Pinky, wait till I get my hands on you... One more day, Alex. The marshalls are on their way with the eviction notice. All the back rent, or I'll have this beautiful boat towed to Cuba for target practice. You couldn't. You wouldn't. I can. I will. [♪♪♪] [MEOWS] Oh, get off that table. Oh, please come back here. Come back here. Hi. Uh... Ahem. RYDER: Oh, oh, come on, Pinky. Oh, come here. Please. Please. I've got other things to do. Oh! Cat fur. Oh, I-I beg your pardon, sir. You stupid animal. Oh, for goodness' sake. Come here. Pinky, please? Oh, for goodness' sake. Come here, please. [PINKY YOWLS] Oh... Oh, man. Oh, God, I can't believe this... Oh, man, oh, man. I don't believe this... All right. Oh, man. Oh, man, oh, man. Is he your cat? Under the circumstances, I think it would be more accurate to say he wasmy cat. It was an accident, honest. It came flying out of nowhere, it was like an orange streak. I-I didn't see him. Calm down, young man. No one's accusing you of vehicular manslaughter. You want him? Just-- Just the collar, please. I'm, uh... I'm sorry about your, uh... Pinky. You are not nearly as sorry as I am, sir. WOMAN: Cat killer. [♪♪♪] No, no, no, if a dog don't hunt, you shoot it, you understand what I'm saying? That's just the way business is done... [WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY] No, no, I can't be blamed if a few people are out of jobs... Hey. Mr. Ashley, your bourbon and 7. Well, thank you very kindly, darlin'. [WEAKLY] Miss. Miss. Excuse me, sir, but this is a private club. Yeah? Yeah, I know, I'm thinkin' of joining. Really? Yeah, yeah, I'm just, uh, checkin' it out. Membership's closed at the moment. Yeah. Well, I'm sure it is. Maybe, uh, this'll help, huh? Yeah. Lunch. Mr. Hancock is talking business, right? You can't talk about it and kill the American dream, can you? Thank you. Okay? CHESTER: Good morning, Woodrow. That's it right there, marshall. The Invincible,24 A. Well... Um... Alexander Hollingsworth? Uh, no, no. I'm his butler. Can I help you? Yes. Do you know where we can find him? Well, I'm afraid he's gone shopping. He's a great shopper. Has a black belt. My own little kind of a joke there. I think you're Alexander Hollingsworth. Me? No, no, no. He's a great strapping fellow. You'd like him. Great. Oh, as a matter of fact, there he comes now. [♪♪♪] Hey. Wait a minute. Oh, my suntan lotion. Thank you. Talk later, ma'am. [♪♪♪] ALEX: Hello. How are you? Look at this guy. Look at him. [LAUGHS] If I were you, I'd go dancing... The water is quite warm. [EXCLAIMS] Oh, excuse me. I am sorry. [SCOFFS] Did somebody push you in? No, I always go swimming fully clothed. It's great resistance training. Now I'm a little pressed for time. Would you mind if I shared the facilities with you? Micabana, sucabana. Well, in that case, um, uh... Lauren. Lauren, would you stand watch for me, please? Sure. Who am I looking for? Anybody in uniform. Well, I'm wearing a uniform. Yeah. But unless your name is Conchita Gonzalez, I think you're crashing this place. Well, now, I'd say we both have something to hide. Can I turn around? Are you decent? Well, some people say I'm tremendous. Well, Mr. Tremendous, the coast is clear. [♪♪♪] Thank you, Conchita. [GIGGLES] It's been a pleasure. Sir... [GASPS] [SCREAMING] [WATER SPLASHES] Someone just fell. MAN: Get the paramedics up here... Boy... There's a tough break for you. MAN: You got him? I guess that means we need to get ourselves another investor. Oh, nice funeral service, wasn't it? Very moving, sir. Good old Nelson, fine fellow. Last of a dying breed. True gentleman, sir. Even if he didn't tip his staff at Christmas. Strange him going like that. He was always so mindful of his health. Well, Ryder, when your time is up, your time is up. There's really nothing you can do about it. [ENGINE STARTS] Well, excuse me, sir, are you having the Rolls detailed today? Ryder, I can't afford to put air in the tires. Well, then, may I conclude it's being repossessed? Hey. Hey, you, wait. Hey. Hey, wait. I'm telling you, this guy's world is falling apart... Like mine? Oh, that's very funny, Manly, has-- No, no, Mr. Manly... Now if-- I'm sorry. Look, I'll take full responsibility on this one. Oh, this is my baby. I can bring this guy down... End of an era, Ryder. End of an era. Perhaps Father was right. Besides winning the Socialite of the Year Award in '83, what have I really contributed to the world? I'm afraid my life is as worthless as my bank account. Oh, don't despair, sir. You'll bounce back. Fortune has a way of turning around when you least expect it. I suppose I'll have to sell the Picasso. May I remind you, sir, that particular painting is a reproduction? The fellow who did it for you is sequestered behind bars. And a tragic waste of talent it is. Perhaps, sir, have you ever thought of selling the Burgundy? Ryder, I will drink that bottle of Burgundy on my death bed and not a minute sooner. Are you all right, sir? No. Not really. Hasn't been the best of days for you, has it? We're being evicted from the boat slip. They want to repossess The Invincible. They already have the Rolls. Your best friend passes away suddenly. And I've had a report that your bottom needs attention. What? Worms, sir. Worms... The Invinciblehas worms. The Invincible? Oh, thank God... I haven't seen Pinky recently. I suppose he's deserted me too? Oh, well I, I expect he's out-out mousing, sir. He'll return when the hunt is up. Last time I saw him, he seemed a bit run down. Yes, sir, when I saw him he was-- He was rather flat. Will you be needing me after dinner, sir? You could stick around. We could talk. Well, I-I have a pressing engagement. Long-term commitment, sir, I'll... I'll see you in the morning, sir. Perhaps. Thank you. Yes, perhaps. [SMOOTH JAZZ PLAYING OVER SPEAKER] Hm. [CHUCKLES] [BLOWS] Hello? [CORK POPS] [CUP SPLASHES] Oh. Ahem. [SIGHS] To Alexander Turnball Hollingsworth, III. He swarm with the sharks and sleep with the fishes. [CHUCKLES] He came, he saw, he squandered! [♪♪♪] Oh, this is ridiculous. Don't! I got you. No! You know what you just did? I stopped you from killing yourself. You drowned a 7000-dollar bottle of wine. It was open, you idiot. [WHISTLING] Up and at 'em, champ. Brand new day. What time is it? About 8. Please say pm. [CHUCKLES] Oh, you're real, I thought I was just drunk. Aren't you an agent or something? I remember a badge. Oh. Ed Smith, United States Justice Department. Ooh. [GRUNTS] Oh, oh! Are you okay? Oh, yes, I'm fine. Thank you. A little soggy there, but here's my picture. Boy, I've really bottomed out. I'm lying on the floor having a conversation with a G-man in bowser boxers. A gift from my niece. I only packed one suit. Wash and wear, drip dry. A few accessories, you can wear this baby anywhere. And it looks like you have. All right, there you go. What's that? It's coffee. I made it myself. [EXCLAIMS] Ryder, espresso and juice. Orange. Orange and white Tom, about five years, 20 pounds. Well, we don't get many custom orders around here. You see, I was quite attached to him. Actually, the people who pay my salary were quite attached. I don't think I could face their disappointment. Well, I got a big white one over there. You wanna paint stripes on him? [CHUCKLES] No. With my luck, they'd probably wash off, thank you. [DOGS BARKING] [♪♪♪] [CHUCKLES] Oh, yes, yes. [GROWLS] [HISSES] [EXCLAIMING] Bugger! Here... Hungry, kitty? Come along. Here, kitty, kitty. Nice cat. Good cat. [CAT YOWLING] [RYDER SHOUTING] Oh, you miserable flea cat! Aah! Aah! Aah! [♪♪♪] What do you actually do at the Justice Department? When you're not wreaking havoc on innocent people. Special Agent, International Investigations Unit. Ex-CIA. Ah. Downwardly mobile, eh? Hey, I'm a victim of the New World Order. And I'm on my way up. They don't give you one of these babies unless you're on the rise. Ah, federal government's issuing cellular phones. Well, so much for deficit reduction. [♪♪♪] Am I under arrest? Could be. Tax evasion. Undeclared income. You've seen my tax records? The few we could find. The IRS has 'em posted in the lunch room. Joke of the month. But we might be able to work something out. In return for what? [♪♪♪] ED: You move in the circles we're trying to penetrate. And you want me to help you nail someone, right? Where are you from, young man? Pawhuska, Oklahoma. Well, I don't know how they do things in cowpie country, but here in Palm Beach, we don't snitch, squeal, or rat on our friends. What's in it for me? Well, let's just say we're prepared to cover a few of your expenses... It'll wash right out. Anyway, we're here. Ahem. ALEX: Henry Ashley's place. An old friend? Ashley's a human oil slick. ED: You were in business with him once. ALEX: We weren't exactly partners. ED: He burned you big time, didn't he? You are intrusive, aren't you? You could burn him back. You want me to throw in with him again? With what? Ashley knows all about me. Everybody in Palm Beach knows I'm so broke I can't pay attention. We think Ashley's latest scheme is off-shore arms trading. Big deals, done in cash, and he gets from heavy hitting investors. We'll stake you the investment money. You buy in, track the deal, and then when there's enough evidence to convict, I pinch him. [SNAPS FINGERS] [CHUCKLES] What do you say? Well, it'd be nice to see him squirm. What if I told you I think he killed Arthur Nelson? Nelson contacted us last week, wanted to talk about Ashley in return for immunity. So they sent me down. I think Ashley got to him before I did. He's a bad guy, Mister H. And Ed Smith here is gonna bring him down. You gonna help me or what? Arthur Nelson, huh? Mm-hm. All right. There are a few little points I wanna iron out before we proceed. One, please never, never call me Mister H. And two, what exactly do you mean by covering expenses? [♪♪♪] [CHUCKLES] We'll talk about that. You didn't know he was going to the Feds. I don't know the sun is gonna come up tomorrow, but I got a pretty damn good idea. My arrangements with suppliers specified the amount and the time of delivery. Without Nelson's cash-- His share can be replaced. In 48 hours. Where are you gonna find that kind of money, in cash, in two days? In my country, we have a saying that says you don't fry the chicken before collecting the eggs. [CHUCKLES] Well, you know, Phillipe, we got a saying where I come from too. We say that everything, everything past its usefulness is entirely disposable. We're still 5 million short. What are you gonna do? What I do best, Phillipe. Improvise. [SHUTTER CLICKING] Okay, now I got a budget, not a big one, but I think you're gonna-- The first thing we do is bail out my Rolls Royce. What for? Well, you can't sting someone like Ashley on a shoestring. We got a perfectly good car. For delivering pizzas, yes. But the Rolls is an essential part of my image. You're not starting to bean count on me already, are you? I'm responsible for every nickel. It's taxpayer's money. So I'm a taxpayer. Not lately. Just how important is catching Ashley to your job? Okay, okay, okay. But we got a deal here now, right? Yes, of course, dear boy. I think you've twisted my arm. Ah, just the man I wanted to see. How good to see you again.[GRUNTS] You can cancel the tugboat, I've had a windfall. Take care of it, would you? Back dues on the boat slip. Expenses, partner. Oh, yeah. [SIGHING] All right. Ahem. How much? Fourteen thousand dollars. [GASPS] [♪♪♪] Hello, Ryder. What have you done to yourself? Oh, a dull razor, sir. And your hand? It slipped. Fourteen thousand dollars? Fourteen thousand dollars to rent water? Oh, this is Ed Smith. You wanna tell me what other little surprises you might have in... ALEX: Ryder is my butler. Your butler? He's essential to my image. So, uh, was this the... How do you do, Mr. Smith? [MEOWS] Oh, Ryder, you found Pinky. Pinky? Hello, Pinky. [SNARLS] Oh, frisky little devil, isn't he? Vermin blood, sir. It charges his batteries. Brings 'em right back to life, I'd say. Shall I fix lunch, sir? Oh, yes, excellent idea. We can celebrate our partnership. Partnership, sir? Yes, Ed is a federal agent, and our new financier. You and I are going into the undercover business, Ryder. Undercover business? Oh, how thrilling. Welcome aboard, Mr. Ed. [♪♪♪] [CHUCKLES] Now, let me see, Ashley's gonna wanna know my financial position. Unfortunately, the coffers are empty at the moment. So I'm going to need an immediate infusion of cash in my bank account. How much you thinking? Oh, I don't know. Half a million dollars. Something like that. [SCOFFS] Get real, bud. This is the age of government austerity. But I'm not gonna spend it. Just for appearances. The first thing we have to do is track down Ashley and then get his attention. You're not gonna spend it? No. AUCTIONEER: Three-fifty, now 375. We're at $350,000. Any advance on $350,000, ladies and gentlemen. We're at $350,000. The front row, on the first call. MAN: Well, hello, Bill. Hi, good to see you. Ethel. Three-fifty on the second call, ladies and gentlemen. Three-fifty on the third and final call. Sold, $350,000. Thank you... Not buying anything. Got it? Just window shopping. I told you he'd be here. Over there... [♪♪♪] Excuse me. Magnificent animal. That's a lot of horse, all right. Didn't we meet at the club the other day by the pool? We didn't exactly meet. Now we have. I'm Henry Ashley. I know who you are. Everybody knows who you are. I'm Lauren. Lauren Masters. Well, very pleased to meet you, young lady. Come on up here. I'll show you how it all works. I'd be delighted. You wouldn't be related to Marv Masters, the Chicago banker, would you? My father. Next up, son of Danny's Heir... This is tiny, tiny world. ...1990 horse of the year. I should give him more of my business, don't you think? I think he'd love it. Thistlerose Farms, Rocket Bob. And what will you give for Rocket Bob? Two-ten. That's a 20. Two-twenty. Now 230, $230,000 is the bid. Two-forty. Now 240. Two-forty. Now 250. Two-forty. Two-fifty. Two-fifty. Two-sixty, 260,000 and now. Two-sixty. Two-sixty. See, the trick is to know when to jump in. Let them all get tired now, and then you bid what the horse is really worth. What do you mean? Three-seventy five. ED: What are you doing? Three-seventy five. Thank you. Three hundred and seventy five is bid. Three-seventy five. Three-eighty. Three-eighty five. I should ask you this, I don't wanna know the answer. Three hundred and eighty five what? Thousand dollars. I think you have a serious psychological problem. Thank you. Three-eighty five, now $400,000. Four. Four hundred thousand dollars. I think you should back off. No, trust me. He's hooked. Four hundred and now 450. Four-fifty. I could get shot for this, you know. On the first call, second... Four-seventy five. Goodbye flip phone. Four-seventy-five and five hundred thousand dollars. We're at four hundred and seventy-five thousand dollars. Don't even think about it. You're calling the shots. Thank God. Five! I'm a dead man. We're at five hundred and now 525. Five hundred and now 525 and at $525,000. We're at $500,000 on the first call. They're gonna send me down to postal service. Five hundred thousand dollars on the second call. Five hundred thousand dollars on the third, and final call. Ladies and gentlemen... ED: Please... Sold $500,000 Rocket Bob. You just spent all our money. Yes, but I did get his attention. [♪♪♪] I should have let you drown. [CHUCKLING] Okay, okay. I'm okay with this. I'm okay with this. We'll get the money back. We'll just sell him ourselves. We could put him in the Cavalry. We still have a Cavalry, don't we? Take care of that for me, won't you? Five hundred thousand dollars... Hollingsworth, you hound. How's it feel to be a winner for a change? [BOTH CHUCKLE] This is Lauren Masters from Chicago, my lovely new friend. Alexander Hollingsworth, very old friend. Henry tends to exaggerate. I'm not that old, and he's really not my friend. We just happen to be members of the same yacht club. I have the distinct impression, though, that we've met somewhere before. Yes, that wonderful Cuban place downtown. La Cabana. La Cabana. Yes. ASHLEY: Funny, Alex, I heard your daddy cut bait and you were bottom feeding. Ugly rumors, Henry. And those same small minds are saying that you're going to stop scamming widows for lunch money. But I'm being impolite. This is Ed Smith, my bodyguard. My, you are on a budget, aren't you? Pleasure to meet you, sir. Ahem. Ma'am. Well, Hollingsworth, you know I let you outbid me. We could have gone back and forth till doomsday, but why run up the price, huh? I'll buy him from you right now. Five-fifty. Cash. Sporting gesture of yours, Henry, but I'm afraid much too low. Mr. Hollingsworth, sir, I think his offer is definitely worth considering because-- Well, I-I appreciate your acumen in business matters, but no sale. I'm sorry. As a matter of fact, I was thinking of entering Rocket Bob in the Breeder's Premiere at Calder next week. Oh, now, that is exactly what I was gonna do. Tell you what, why don't you nap on it this afternoon and come on over to my place tonight. We're having some folks over for chow. I'd love to, Henry. I really would. But unfortunately, my dance card is filled. Perhaps some other time. It's been a pleasure once again, Chiquita. It always is. Ed. This is unbelievable. This is insane. The man just offered us a 50,000-dollar profit for doing absolutely nothing. But the right kind of nothing, and we've got to do more of it. And the party? We're supposed to be infiltrating, not playing hard to get. Ed, do you know nothing of foreplay? Foreplay? Is that what you expect me to tell Manly? It's foreplay... No, that's a figure of speech. We're stringing him along... And, when you think about it, it's not that much. Okay, it is that much, but, uh, we're not talking about dog food here. I mean, this is a, this is a-- This is a thoroughbred. I mean, you should see... Hello, Mr. Manly? Alexander Hollingsworth here. Yes, yes. Well, I wanted to commend you on the choice of the man you have to work with me. Ed Smith. He's really a wonderful fellow. I'm sorry. What has he for brains? Oh, well, how graphic... [CHUCKLES] Yes, he wants me to mention the Wagner Affair. Oh, yes. Oh, yes, well, of course we're going to race Rocket Bob. He has to prove himself on the circuit before we can sell. Especially at the price you paid for him... Yes. Now Ed informs me that you're about to retire. Is that correct? No. No. Well, this could cast quite a pall on that procedure. Could it not? I see. Well, certainly. Yes. This will remain strictly between you and us. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Manly. The Wagner Affair? Uh... I was CIA then. Uh... All right, look, I'll be square with you. My butt's on the line here. If I don't pull this off, it's Immigration and Naturalization for me. We call it Calcutta on the Potomac. I really need this one. Ed. We all want a piece of Ashley. [♪♪♪] Goodness gracious, Ryder, what did you do to your other hand? I-I nicked myself opening a can for Pinky. You know how he loves tuna fish. Cat did that to me, I'd turn him into ear muffs. Now be gentle, Ed. Ryder's very sensitive about Pinky. When he loses that cat, he loses his job. You know, I think I'm gonna use my other cuff links. Can I get them? No, no, I'll find them. [ED CHUCKLES] Just how many Pinkys have there been? [EXCLAIMS] I-I beg your pardon, sir? Think I might have a little bit of that bubbly, Ryder? My pleasure, sir. Oh, you better go easy on the drink, Ed. They'll be plenty at Ashley's party. And you better get dressed. Party? What are you senile? You snubbed it. Don't they teach you anything at spy school? You're supposed to know and understand your adversary. [KNOCKING] Package for a Mr. Alex Hollingsworth. What is it? An invitation to Mr. Ashley's party. Well, now how did you--? When someone like Ashley wants something as badly as he does Rocket Bob, he won't take no for an answer. You did bring a tux? What's wrong with this? [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] [LIGHT JAZZ PLAYING] ALEX: Oops, you all right? They giving out door prizes for cleavage tonight? No. And not for pink cummerbunds either. It's my fault. I should have told you this was not gonna be a senior prom. I would have been perfectly happy to wear the green suit. It was your idea to rent a tux. A tux, yes. But that looks like you mugged a Mambo King. Charles, hi. I don't know. It kind of says Florida to me. Why, Alex Hollingsworth. You recluse, you. I haven't seen you since Roxanne's last seance. Oh, yes, I remember. You brought the llama. Oh, yes. We heard you had fallen on hard times. I like to think of that as a character building moment. Oh, well, you're just as adorable as ever, darling. [CHUCKLES] Oh, look, there's Margaret DeForge. The Liposuction Queen. Well, I'll catch up with you later, darling. Oh, my God. Roxanne's? I was in charge of the Polaroid. You gonna go to work? Go to work? Mingle. Mingle? You asked me to get your foot in the door, so mingle. Not on an empty stomach. Oh, check the new arrival. Another investor judging from those black bags he brought in. LAUREN: Nice to see old friends meet. In Henry Ashley's world, an old friend is an oxymoron. Oh, I must say, you look delightful tonight. Thank you. Hollingsworth, you made it, huh? And I see you made a beeline for Ms. Masters. Well, actually, she made a beeline for me. How's the chow, Mr. Smith? It's fine, thanks. I have a problem with squid tentacles, but hey, enjoy. So you changed your mind about Rocket Bob? Well, not about selling him outright, but I think I have a sporting venture for you. Something on the side? A wager between gentlemen. With Rocket Bob as the prize. I always admire a man willing to take a few risks. Henry, darling, you must come see Jennifer Barnes' breasts. They're positively aerodynamic. I gotta go play host for a while. Now we'll talk later. Shall we mix, darlin'? Good looking girl. Too good for him. And too young too. See the way she smiled at me? I'm getting signals. [SCOFFS] You must be getting your signals from another planet, Ed. I think I got work to do... [♪♪♪] [KNOB RATTLING] [LOCK RATTLING] ASHLEY: Why don't we give it a little look-see before we put it away in the safe tonight? Want it there? Good. Good. That's nine down and one to go. You found another investor? Phillipe, take a look around you. There got to be about a billion dollars' worth of silver hair out there tonight. Somebody probably got that 5 million in their damn change purse. I'm going back to the party. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [LOCK CLICKS] Damn it... Come on. [COCKS GUN] [CHUCKLES AWKWARDLY] Great party, huh? [♪♪♪] ASHLEY: Anything on him? He made the wrong turn coming out of the men's room. It could happen to anyone. Champagne goes to my head. I get confused. Easy on the thumb, Jack. No harm done. It's a big place. Sometimes even I need a road map to find my way to the can. Carlos apologizes for any discomfort he may have caused. Carlos? Thank you. Hey, it's all water under the bridge. Alex, you wanna talk horse now? Come on, why don't we take a stroll outside. Let me-- Now let me get this straight. You put up Rocket Bob, and I put up what you paid for him. Half a million dollars. If the horse wins, I keep him and the money. If he loses... Even if he comes in second. If he comes in anything but first, it's all yours. [LAUGHS] Alex, the one thing I always liked about you, you like to hang it out there, don't you? You like to lay it on the line. You got a deal. You do me the honor of being my guest this weekend. A bunch of us are getting together at Rue La Mer in Nassau. Do I smell a pitch coming? Well, Alex, horses are a lot of fun and all, but I got something very sweet I think you might be interested in. You silver-tongued devil. [BOTH CHUCKLE] [NEIGHS] ED: Are you out of your mind? What if Bob loses? We're out half a million. He can't lose. Or rather, we can't lose, not if you do your job properly. Ashley cannot collect on that debt if he's in jail, can he? Excuse me, sir. CHESTER: Alex. Mr. Alex. I need to speak to you. I believe I see trouble brewing. Mr. Smith, I have an overnight package here from Washington marked urgent. It's expense money. I got Manly to spring for more cash. It was not a fun conversation. Chester, I'll take that. I'm sure my eyes are deceiving me, but is that a horse? Uh... It's a thoroughbred. On club property? Well, he's, uh-- He's very quiet, very quiet. And it'll only be for a few days. Now I think you could probably find a way of looking another way for a while. Forget about this whole thing. Perhaps if you don't ride him in the pool area. Yeah, well, he's gonna be at the track most of the time. Or eat the grass. He's on an oat and hay diet. Lovely. Heh, heh. Lovely animal. Remember, next week, slip fees due. Here, all right, all right, all right. Here it is, here it is. This is what we're taking to the Bahamas. The rest I'm going to give to you, Ryder, because I know I can trust you. Certainly. And you'll take care of Rocket Bob. You know how I am with animals, sir. Especially cats. Where is the old Pinkster this morning? He's at the veterinarian. Hmm. Good. All right, we're off. Uh, you can reach us on the boat. We're taking the boat? Yeah, it's just a short trip over. Do you have a problem with that? No, no. Uh... Just not a lot of ocean in Oklahoma. Well, the Bermuda Triangle is beautiful this time of year. Bermuda what? [♪♪♪] [ED VOMITING] ALEX: Ed, we're not even out of the channel yet. Wait till it gets rough. ED: Aw... [PLANE LANDING, TIRES SQUEALING ON RUNWAY] ED: Hey, you wanna grab this rope here? [WAILING] [LAUGHS] [LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY] Park it where you can see it. And where nobody else can. Where's the green suit? You ain't got a dryer in here. Here you go. Come on, come on, let's go. Ed, for the 10th time, all we have to do is pick up the house phone and call him. He invited us. He knows we're coming. Then he'd know we're here. And I thought the government hired college graduates. MAN: Schmitty? That you? Tubbs. Hey, never expected to see you at the Rue La Mer. Then I saw that green suit. Actually, I'm undercover. Undercover, huh? So Manly actually gave you something manly to do, huh? [CHUCKLES] Jack Tubbs, Justice Department. Alexander Hollingsworth, tax delinquent. Ha-ha-ha! What are you doing here? My operation, bud. Yeah, that'll put a dent in the deficit. Taking the cash back to Miami tomorrow. Manly told me to stay the night and have a good time and I intend to. Wow, that's, uh-- Congratulations. Yeah, I heard Washington was so impressed they're talking about sending me back to Langley. CIA, huh? That's great. That's just great. So Manly has really got you working undercover, huh? Amazing. And you wonder why there was a Watergate. Arrogance is a disease of the soul, Ed. Don't let it depress you. Yeah, yeah, right. [♪♪♪] [ELEVATOR BELL DINGS] There he is. You wanna say hi? No, I think you're right. We ought to stay undercover. [IN SPANISH] [IN SPANISH] [SHUTTER CLICKING] ALEX: That's a nice shot. Try one with the lighthouse in the background. That's kind of pretty. Mr. Hollingsworth. Alex, please. I know. Pleasant surprise. A surprise, yes. Are you stalking me? Stalking? Oh, that's an ugly word. A remarkable coincidence then. Or, maybe our destiny. You come down this morning? On Henry's plane. Oh, he's taken quite a liking to you. Does that surprise you? No. No. I would think most men would be delighted to take care of you. Men don't take care of me. Money does. It can't keep you warm at night. I'm not sleeping with him. I didn't ask that. It was in your eyes. Ashley's rich, he's charming... But business. I didn't say that. In your eyes. We seem to think alike, Alex. That's why I could never trust you. That mean you won't tell me why you were snooping around the party the other night? Very observant. Why don't I let you figure that out? Well, if it was just money, you'd have it and be out of here by now. So I think you have something else on your agenda. Which might be none of your business. No, except that Henry has asked me to go into a little venture with him. [LAUGHS] Oh, what, are you looking out for your partner? Protecting my investment. Why do I have a hard time believing that? Maybe it's because something keeps sort of digging me in the side and poking me in the ribs? Yes, that was it. Why don't we just keep this between us, okay? And, uh, don't forget to tell Ed, he owes me one. [SIGHS] It's never gonna happen, is it? I'm a screwup, I'm a hack. In five years I'll be in Agricultural Investigation, running down bad hybrids. Oh, Ed, you're in the midst of a crisis of confidence. You have all the talents. All you need to do is have the audacity to exercise them. Gamble a little like we're gonna do tonight. With a give grand limit. Tops. We can't spend a dime more than that. Of course, I know that. [PHONE RINGS] Smith here... Doing good. Did you get those photos I faxed you? Get out of here. The guy on the pier's an arms dealer, big time. Anything yet on the girl? Huh. Oh, damn. Where's Ryder when I need him? Kitty? Kitty, kitty? I-- I-I have tuna for you. Kitty, where are you? It's dolphin-free. You miserable lump of fur. Will you please stay still so as I can find you. I'm just exhausted. I thought you'd be up all night. [HORSE NEIGHS] You crazy cat. Where are you? You are the most stupid, annoying animal. Cat. Thirty-six red. Five thousand is our limit. We're 10 times over that now. This has gotta end. Ed, have confidence. If we fold now, the ball game is over. It'll turn around for us. Besides, we're having fun, aren't we? One thousand on 23 red. DEALER: Eight black. [GROANS] Please, please, please, don't do that again. If we're gonna convince Ashley that we're big players, we have to play big. Two thousand on 23 red, please. I'm gonna get you for this. [SIGHS] DEALER: Fifteen black. WOMAN [CHUCKLES]: Oh! You win! Oh, well. ALEX: Um... Five thousand-- Would you take your hands... No. No. Ashley is watching. No, I'm not gonna-- I don't care. No, no, no... Are we ready now? Quite. Thank you so much. Do give me this now. All these on 23 red. Yes. [CLEARS THROAT] There is no place like home. No place like home. There is no place like home. There is no place like home. No place like home. DEALER: Close bets. Twenty-three red. Yes. Yes. All right, all right. This is government property. Your lucky night, Hollingsworth. Oh, it's just money. Well, I like your attitude. I got something a lot better for you than roulette, friend. Is it as much fun? It'll double your stake overnight. That's a lot more fun. So how fast can you lay your hands on 5 million cash? Five million... Um... Yes, 5 million. I could do that. I thought you were talking about real money. [BOTH CHUCKLE] You don't have to count that here, they'll do that for you. [♪♪♪] PHILLIPE [IN SPANISH]: CUJO [IN SPANISH]: [SHUTTER CLICKING] PHILLIPE: CUJO: Adios. PHILLIPE: CARLOS [IN SPANISH]: [PHILLIPE SHOUTS IN SPANISH] [GUNSHOTS] [ENGINE STARTS] [SIREN WAILING] [SIGHS] Thanks for coming to my rescue. I was flattered you called me, but kind of surprised you didn't call Ashley. You have friends in high places. You're a cop? U.S. Justice Department. What? And you're in this with him? It was that or debtors prison. Look, I didn't kill anybody. If I thought you did, I wouldn't be getting you out, Ms. Masters. Or is it Laura Miller or Virginia Hammond? Or Barbara Tannen? Or, uh... Ouch, what is this? Outstanding warrants in Zurich and Monte Carlo for fraud? Suspicion of fraud. Well, you certainly get around, don't you? Okay. It's Lauren. Lauren Morton. And you didn't see who killed Phillipe? Like I told the police, I was out for a walk, I heard a couple of shots. When I came back he was already... Well, he was lying there... Dead. Shot dead. Yeah. Yeah. Probably by Ashley and one of his associates, but we'll never know, will we? Why did you spring me? I need help. Well, why don't you call the Red Cross? We can do this the hard way or my way. These are pretty serious charges. And what might your way be? Stay with us on Alex's yacht till the dust settles in the morning. If it's safe, I want you to go back to the hotel, pretend like nothing happened, keep an eye on Ashley, let us know what he's up to. Well, what's in it for me? Why does that sound familiar? A girl after my own heart. [CHUCKLES] Where are you? Miserable little feather duster with claws. Keeping me up half the night, as if I haven't got anything better to do. I much prefer horses. They stay put and they look you in the eye and they... Oh, there you are, you impertinent feline. Like horse food, do you? Did you leave anything for Rocket... Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. ED: Five million dollars. Five million dollars? How am I gonna ask Manly for 5 million dollars? And we have to have it by 10:00 this morning. Why don't you say 10 minutes from now, you'd have exactly the same chance. Ed, would you like to know the secret of success in my life? Your what? You're poor! Not poor. Broke. Broke is a temporary inconvenience. Poor is a state of mind. Confidence, dear boy. If you believe in yourself, everyone will believe in you too. It's just as simple as that. Put it on a bumper sticker, Al! Ah. Well, if that's your attitude, I suppose this is going to be another Wagner Affair. Hey, that's a low blow. If the Feds don't come up with the money, you're never gonna get Ashley. Best time to throw in the towel. Well, I think that might be a little premature. Didn't you say your friend Tubby was gonna move this to the mainland today? I saw the three of them together. Are you certain it was Ms. Masters? Police picked her up. Hollingsworth's bodyguard is with Justice? Si. Well, Carlos, I think it might be prudent to exercise Plan B. Ed, you can do it. I cannot do it. I am breaking a federal law here. At the very least, operational protocol. I screw up again-- Ed, look at me. This is it. You're right. This is it. This is it. This is it! Now, Ed. Ed Smith, U.S. Department of Justice. Yes, sir, what can I do for you? I'm here to pick up the cash. Oh, yeah. We were expecting Agent... Agent Tubbs. You were expecting Agent Tubbs. Jerk got so drunk celebrating, he's in the hospital. I had to catch a 5 a.m. flight out of Miami. Take a look at your ID again. Yeah, sure. A little hot down here, huh? Well, I don't have time to wait around while you guys get your thumbs out... Call Manly. Call Manly at Langley. You heard of Langley? That's CIA, baby. Get your supervisor down here. Give me the phone. Give me the phone, I'll call Manly and he'll read your boss the riot act! Hey, all we need is a fingerprint, and then you can sign for it, okay? Fine. Fine, let's go. [♪♪♪] Yee-haw! [LAUGHS] Was I great? Was I confident? I was an animal! Well, I hope you're a hungry animal because I took the time to make breakfast. Oh, I had to borrow some clothes. I hope you don't mind. Bowser never looked so good. Or so happy. Let me have your flip phone, would you? Fine. Coffee, Lauren, please, and lots of it. You two seem like you robbed a bank. [LAUGHS] That's good. That's really good. Robbed a bank. Mmm! That's great coffee. Great coffee. Ahem. Do you know... what's in these bales? Do you have any idea? Money? Yeah, money. Money. Nine million dollars! Ha-ha-ha-ha! Henry Ashley, please. Mm. Thank you. Mm-hm. Well, hello, Alex. I take it you found your chips. Yes. Yes, I did. Now what's the procedure? Just bring it on down to the airport at 10. You and the other investors take my jet to the Caymans. And stay there as my guests. ALEX: Cayman Islands, huh? The pay-off will be placed in 24 hours in a bank account there, payable only to you, in person. From that point on, you do with it what you please. [CHUCKLES] Spend it, of course. All right, I'll see you at the airport. I'll be there just long enough to collect your investment and pass it on. Business is business, you understand? Yeah. Yes. Yes, I do. Everything okay? Yeah. Yeah, I meet him at the airport at 10. You know, uh... You know we should-- We should find some place, some place... for the rest of this cash. Somewhere... Safe. Yeah. You know, Lauren, we could do tremendous things together. Like... Like drink coffee. You know, Ryder must get the name of this blend. It's wonderful coffee. Sweet dreams, gentlemen. Oh, it's been a hard day's night. [BUTTONS BEEPING] ED: No. No. No! [SIGHS] How? What is it? What was in that coffee? Oh, dichloro-methyl-alki... I don't know. A lady of the night dropped some on a friend of mine down in Rio, stole everything he had. I'll bet it didn't add up to 5 million. Government money, big deal. Oh, God, we're going to jail! Well, look at the bright side, she didn't take all of it. She didn't, did she? Why not? ALEX: I think I have the answer. Oh, you running errands for Hollingsworth now? I don't run errands for anyone. Hollingsworth isn't coming. This is my stake. Oh, my goodness. A woman with larceny in her heart. I knew there was something besides your legs I liked about you. [CHUCKLES] Ooh, but can I really be a party to this theft of Mr. Hollingsworth's hard-earned money. I don't think you're gonna have a problem. Not when you know I've documented your entire operation. Photographs, tapes. I was there when Carlos killed Phillipe. Oh, that was you. We were wondering. And that information is gonna go straight to the Feds if you don't let me buy in. Where on earth you come from? My father was Danny Morton. Danny Morton? ALEX: Yeah, I remember him. He's an old friend of Ashley's, small time crook. Took a fall for Ashley in some financial deal in Switzerland. Lauren said he died last year in jail. So if she did this for revenge, why didn't she take our money? "Alex, I am taking your place on the plane. I'll return this stake money as soon as I get paid off in the Caymans. Sorry for the trouble, Eddie, but Alex understands. I'm just a greedy girl." Yeah. And I'm on my way to the airport. [♪♪♪] Now I'm sorry about your daddy, Lauren, but I think you understand. We're like peas in a pod, you and me, when it comes to the deal. Well, business is business. I think maybe this trip will even things up. I thought you might say that. Leroy, fetch the young lady's bag, please. ED: Come on, let's go! Let's go! ALEX: I don't think we're gonna make it, Ed. It's almost 10. I'll make an example of her. Nobody makes Ed Smith look like a fool. I don't know, I don't have any difficulty. Look out! What are you, crazy? I'll bust her when they get back from the Caymans. Are you kidding? You're never gonna see her again. Please, slow down, would you? I'll fly to the Caymans and I'll bust them when they get off the plane! Ed, you don't understand. You don't have any authority in the Caymans. Besides, he's not even gonna be there. He said he'd meet me at the race track tomorrow. We have a deal, remember? [IMITATES ASHLEY] "Business is business"? Well... Oh, my God. What? What's the matter? He told me "business is business." He said the same thing 15 years ago. In his terminology, that means a deal has gone sour. What are you talking about? If he killed Nelson because he was afraid he was gonna talk, he knows the Feds are on to him. Well, he knows his number's coming up, sure. He can't take a chance on having another Nelson in his investment group. Everyone who can testify against him is on that plane. There's no arms deal going down. The only thing going down is that jet, and Lauren's probably on it. Come on, hit it! [♪♪♪] [HONKING] [BOTH SCREAM] They drive on the left side of the road in the Bahamas, Ed! There it is. There's Ashley's plane. All right, they're almost at the end of the runway. This is gonna be close. Hold on. Ed! [SCREAMS] If I could just swerve... [SHOUTING] There's a fence down there. We're going through it! [LAUGHS] Are you crazy? There they are! This'll stop them! I wanna thank you for helping me with my confidence problem. You're welcome, I think. Without you, none of this would have been possible. I didn't have this in mind. I don't think he sees us. Oh, relax, he sees us. I don't think so. He sees us, he'll stop. I know he will. I'm completely confident. He doesn't see us. I told you! Hey, whoa! [BOTH SCREAMING] [TIRES SQUEALING, BRAKES SCREECHING] [BREATHING HEAVILY] It'll wash out. [TRUMPET PLAYING FANFARE] ANNOUNCER [OVER PA]: The horses are on the track. Today's feature race, a premiere breeders cup. The horses are approaching the starting gate. One lucky man. Terrible tragedy. I have to tell you, I'm absolutely sick about it. But that's no reason to ruin a perfectly good day at the races. Here's my wager. Cashier's check, $500,000, payable to bearer. And here are the papers on Rocket Bob. I hope you don't mind if Ryder holds the wagers. ANNOUNCER: The flag is up. [BELL RINGS] And they're off. My Skipper takes the lead... Rocket Bob trails by six lengths. At the three-eighths for My Skipper and Torture Chamber. Olivia's Dream and Rocket Bob making a move on the outside. [CROWD CHEERING] Into the far turn it's My Skipper and Torture Chamber. Rocket Bob and Olivia's Dream... Rocket Bob is coming on. Turning to home it's My Skipper and Rocket Bob. My Skipper and Rocket Bob. Down the stretch it's Rocket Bob and My Skipper. Rocket Bob and My Skipper neck and neck, head and head. Rocket Bob takes the lead. Rocket Bob winning it by a head! Rocket Bob... Yes. [PEOPLE CLAPPING] Expecting a different result, Henry? Truth is, I never know what to expect with you. [IMITATES ASHLEY] "Business is business." Gets the old adrenaline going. Ah, but not like this one will. I've taken the liberty of asking a few friends over for a little surprise victory celebration, and I hope you'll be able to join us. You remember your investors. I'm told their plane never got off the ground. MAN: There he is. Let's go. I wish Arthur Nelson could be here today. Stay in touch. Don't be a stranger. I'll take those.What? Papers for the horse and the money. Government property, pal. This'll keep the IRS off your back for a while. And I'm guessing this hay burner is gonna be worth a lot more now that he's a winner. After you, Mr. H. So, Ed, tell me about the CIA. Big budget? A lot of money? Yeah, not too big, not too bad. But it bought me this baby. Nice suit. Wash and wear? Absolutely. Never buy anything but. Just throw this baby in the machine, it's as good as new. Everyone seems to be happy, and all is right with the world. And you, sir? Well, I've actually achieved something. I never thought I would find fulfillment in something as mundane and bereft of profit as Civil Service. It may not be all that bad, sir. I placed a wager on Rocket Bob at the track. Good Lord, how much is that? Well, $10,000 at 14-1, $140,000. Not-not too shabby, if I may say so, sir. Well, where on earth did you get it? Well, as I consider this a legitimate expense, I appropriated the money from the envelop that Mr. Ed gave me. I returned the 10,000, of course. It is, after all, government property. [CHUCKLES] Good old Ryder. Yes, we did pretty well, sir, didn't we? Thanks to you. Oh, thank you, sir. And, of course, Rocket Bob. Oh, splendid animal, sir. Splendid animal. Oh, speaking of animals, I haven't seen Pinky around recently. Well, he hasn't been very mobile. Last time I saw him he was rather stiff. Stiff, well... Possibly something to do with his diet. I see. Then I trust you'll take care of that. As I always do, sir. Of course. I'll just go and fetch him. [♪♪♪] [ALEX CHUCKLES] [YOWLING] [♪♪♪]
