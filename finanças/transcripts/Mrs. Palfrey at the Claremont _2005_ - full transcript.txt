It's so nice finally to meet you. We've heard so much about you. Are you enjoying your job in the Archives? I can't imagine such an important thing. Are you open on Sundays? - No. - Yes. - Sorry, did you say "open"? I thought you said do I work on Sundays? We are open 365 days a year, seven days a week. We're... open. - I hope we can see more of you in the future. I have a niece. She's quite lovely. She comes to visit me on Thursdays. You didn't tell me he was such a good-looking young man. I-I suppose you have a girlfriend, d-do you? - Mrs. Post! Postpone interrogations for later. Let them have dinner in peace. - Sorry.

I hope you have a strong stomach. - Good Lord, we're trapped in a Terence Rattigan play. - Mrs. Arbuthnot has been at the Claremont for years. - Yes, I can see. It's entered her soul. - People aren't always what they seem. She was very kind to me on my first night here. - You're quite right. As the poet would say, "We see into the life of things." - That's Wordsworth. - Indeed. Do you enjoy him? - Oh, yes. He's my traveling companion. I take him everywhere. And you? - I like him, but William Blake's my man. - Oh! That was Arthur's favorite poet. - Who's Arthur? Your grandfather, dear. - Oh, yes, of course. Well, there you are. You see, it runs in the family. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you. How do you do? - Fine, thank you. - Bye-bye. - You know, I'm enjoying this too much. Do you think that's wicked? - No. Enjoy it as much as you can. I've never enjoyed myself more... with my clothes on. - Thanks. May I be brutally frank? - Oh, dear. I don't know. - What are you doing here? You don't seem to belong. - Well, that's a long story. I must confess, I feel quite comfortable here. And safe. According to Mrs. Arbuthnot, you're not allowed to die here. Well, that may be wishful thinking on her part. I don't know. I imagined you traveling the world, visiting exotic places. - Oh, I did that. In the past, with Arthur. - Grandpapa. - He would've liked you very much. And vice-versa. - I'm so, so sorry to interrupt. - Uh, Mrs. Burton. - I'm just off to the theater with some friends and I didn't want to miss the grand opportunity of meeting your grandson. Hello, darling. Shirley. Shirley Burton. - Desmond. How do you do? - I see that good looks and charm runs in the family. - That's very kind of you. - You have good genes, Mrs. Palfrey. - Isn't it remarkable how people see what they want to see. - Yes. Remarkable. You don't have to see me out. - I don't have to, but I want to. I don't know how to thank you. You have no idea how much this has meant to me. - Well, it's reciprocal. You've given me ideas, Mrs. Palfrey. - Oh? - A story is shaping up in my mind, something you could help me with. - Oh, tell me. - Would you share with me some of the things that matter to you from your life. And in return, I can show you some from mine. - Most of the things that mattered to me are not around anymore. I live in here... and here. - That's exactly what I mean. - Mrs. Palfrey! He's divine! I can't wait for him to meet my niece. Something tells me, Mrs. Palfrey, that we'll end up being relatives. - Mrs. Post, please don't frighten the poor woman. - Mrs. Palfrey, hello. Although we haven't officially met, I'm Lorna De Salis, and this is my son, Willie. - Oh, how do you do? - We're staying at the Claremont for a brief period until the renovations of our apartment are complete. We're theater people. Oh, we come from generations of theater people. And although I have recently retired from the stage, Willie runs an amateur dramatic group for young actors whom he believes to hold great promise. And sometimes I help out. Do you think your grandson might be interested in joining our little group? I mean, Willie thinks he has the makings of a splendid leading man. Don't you, dear? - Oh, Indeed I do, Mother. - Uh, well, I don't know. I mean, he's a write-- He's very busy at the Archives. - "Archives"? - Yes, at the British Museum. - But a face like that can't be locked away in the Archives. It should be seen-- on the stage, on the box, on the screen. - Willie, dear, now, calm yourself. Remember your blood pressure. He can be rather exuberant at times, but it's what makes him such a brilliant actor. Now, do let us know what your grandson thinks. - I shall. - Good night. - Good evening. - To meet a young man, in this day and age, with such impeccable manners, tells me more about you, Mrs. Palfrey, than about him.

Your grandson. - ♪ - Desmond? - Good morning, Sasa. Listen, I've been writing all night. Oh, it is you. You've been a great success at the Claremont. - You mean "we" have been a great success at the Claremont. Sasa, have you noticed what an unusually beautiful day it is? "And Mrs. Arbuthnot smiled like a dragonfly as she awaited the soup she knew would come." Now, what do you think? Do you recognize yourself? Am I getting it right? - I don't think accuracy should interfere with a good story, but you didn't know me when I was happily married. I was lucky enough to find the almost-perfect man. - "Almost"? - He left me too early. We were still in love. But what he did by dying before me was to make me call on strengths I never knew I had-- to appreciate independence and not to fear the approach of my own last days on earth. Oh, but at your age, one is not equipped to think that way, thank God. - Ludo. - Rosie. Hello. Uh, I don't think you've met my grandmother. - Your grandmother? - Sasa, this is Rosie. Remember, I told you about her. - Oh, yeah. Oh, forgive me, darling. You know I forget everything these days. How do you do? - Uh, Sasa, would you excuse us for just one moment? - Yes. Rosie. Rosie! Rosie! - What the hell happened to you? I woke up one morning, and you were gone--vanished. Just a pair of dirty socks to remember you by. - From our last time together, I thought I was doing you a favor. - You were. - You deserve better than me anyway. - I do. And now that we've cleared that up, what's with the grandmother? - What do you mean? - Your grandmother's dead. - Yeah, most humans have two grandmothers, Rosie. - So she's the American one? - Yeah. Can't you tell? What do I know? When I first saw the two of you from a distance, I thought, Shit, Ludo's entering a new stage-- "Harold and Maude"-- if you know what I mean. - Yeah, well, you got it wrong, as usual. It's nice to see you, Rosie. - Wish I could say the same. I was wondering why a young man of so many qualities didn't have a girlfriend. Or a wife. My qualities are more honeymoon than mortgage. Sorry? I just mean I'm not very successful in the relationship department. - Oh. - For instance, I have a mother... - I suspected as much. - ...who I haven't seen in months. - Oh? Why? - I don't know. We live on different planets. I sometimes visit hers, but she never visits mine. I always leave feeling like a stranger. - I'm afraid I know exactly what you mean. And your father? - My father never made it. He got tired and died. - Oh. - It's very important to praise people a lot early on... otherwise they might die of disappointment. My, uh, mother's disappointed in me. - Well, she shouldn't be. I'd very much like to meet her. - Well, what's the matter? - Sorry. It's just the thought of you two together. It's nothing, really. It's just the thought. Quite bizarre. - Hm. - ♪ - Uh, I think I'd like something quite different this morning. Fresh orange juice-- not the stuff out of a bottle-- and scrambled eggs. - Whatever you say, ma'am. - Well, there you are. Desmond.

Just follow me. - What the hell is going on, grandmother? - Shh! Lower your voice. They don't encourage visitors here. Especially relatives. - Well, that's absurd. - Yes, I agree, it is absurd, but those are the rules. Now, if you want to have lunch or dinner with me, I'd be delighted, but we can't do it here, and you must give me a little more notice. So, you choose a day. - Well, I'm rather busy these days. I'm writing a book. - What? - On Cycladic art. - Well, that should be interesting. - What shall I report back to Mother? After all, that's why I'm here. - Well, don't worry about that. I'll tell her. Now, you really must go, Desmond. Off you go. I'd like to get back to my breakfast. - Who was that, Mrs. Palfrey? - My... my accountant. - Oh, accountants. Why is it they all look the same? - I do love him, you know, and he's very capable, but he does have the most dreadful sense of timing. - One must never love one's accountant, Mrs. Palfrey. - True. What is this? - Scrambled egg, just like you ordered. - Did I? I must be losing my mind. - Whatever you say, ma'am. Mrs. Palfrey, may I approach? - What is it, Major? - "Major"? Do I look like a Major? It'll be news to my sister. - I'm sorry, Mr. Osborne. My mind is completely elsewhere. I've had an unusually agitated morning. Oh, please, sit down. - I completely forgot what I was going to say. Oh, well, it happens. We, all of us, forget things, from time to time, no matter how old we are. - I've remembered why I came over here. I...

Or human sacrifices. - Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no. No, nothing like that. It's... It's a ladies' night. They'd be delighted if you would come, and I'd be delighted if you were to be my guest. - I would love to come, Mr. Osborne. It's a conspiracy. You should've seen me pushing my grandson out of the hotel. I'm going to be ostracized when they find out. - By whom? I'm surprised at you, Mrs. P. Where's your backbone? Calm down. It's only my mother. - "Only." - Hello, Mum. - So, what are you doing? - I'm writing. - I mean, for a living. - You're beginning to sound like an American. - Flattery will get you nowhere. You have to admit, I'm a broadminded person. I don't see my son for months, and then he comes and visits me with you, and I haven't asked for a single explanation. - Mrs. Meyer, there is nothing to explain. I'm a sort of honorary grandmother. Cover your ears. I'm going to embarrass you. - I think I'll get some more tea. - You know, your son is a man of many talents, and he showed me great kindness when I was in distress. I think you should be proud that you have brought him up to be the man he is today, and in case you were not aware of it, you have been often on his mind. That is why I was curious and wanted to meet you. But please forgive me if I seem intrusive. - It might not seem like it, but I fought to give him the best. I never had the luxury of having a husband to fall back on. I raised him all by myself, and I'm damn proud of it, too. Oh, I don't regret it for a single second. I'd do it all over again if I had to.

I saw you blushing. - I thought I was too early, and I didn't want to distract you from your work. - Well, I clocked off an hour ago. I was just waiting for you. We're having dinner in my flat. I've got everything prepared. - Now you're a chef as well? - Well, you be the judge of that. - Now... Mmm. How delicious. - Really? - Really. What do you call this dish? - Tagliatelle a la zucchini a la Ludovic. Golly, Moses. Maybe it was the wine, or a friendship that was growing out of a kind of need. Sometimes I feel I was born in the wrong time. - Why do you say that? - I don't know. I suppose I miss the simplicity of the olden days. - Well, how do you know they were simpler? I'm afraid that's rather a romantic view of a past you never knew. And if you'll forgive my saying so, it seems like an excuse not to deal with your present. - That's funny. That's what Rosie kept telling me. - Oh, dear. Sorry. - No, it's fine. It's fine. I always consider the source when I'm being analyzed. And she... had an agenda. You do not. - Oh, I wasn't analyzing. I... I was simply making an observation as your friend. - And a very astute observation it was. I was reading this paper the other day, and there's this quiz, a personality quiz, designed to measure your capacity for friendship. - Oh. You mean, a quiz can determine all that? - Well, I don't know. Shall we find out? - Well, why not? - Good. Now, let's start with a toughie. "Do you prefer to be a guest or a host?" - Well, I enjoyed our evening together at the hotel. But I must confess I prefer being here. - "If you were kept waiting by a friend "you had arranged to meet, "would you, a, wait patiently "and be forgiving when he or she arrived; "b, go on waiting, but have a row "when whoever it was turned up; or c, give up and go home angry"? - Well, I know you wouldn't keep me waiting, uh... unless there was a very good reason, so I would wait patiently for you to come and then enjoy our time together. - Not just me. Anyone. - Well, there isn't anyone else at the moment. You're the only one I can think of. - I, uh... I haven't many friends myself. One needs money to have friends. They've all got cars and jobs. - One shouldn't let one's friends slip away. - Well, there's very little I can do about it. But look, you know, we can do better than this. Let's make our own quiz. - All right. - Okay, your favorite film. - Well, that would have to be "Brief Encounter". - "Brief Encounter"? - You've never seen it? - I may have. I can't remember. - If you had, you'd remember. I was 18 when I first saw it. It was my first date with Arthur. And by the end, we were both weeping so shamelessly that there was nothing else else for us to do, but fall in love. - Uh, your favorite place? - On Saturdays, before our daughter Elizabeth was born, we used to slip away to the Castle Inn, which is next door to the Abbey at Bewley, and we'd have a sumptuous dinner and then spend the rest of the evening... together. And on Sundays we'd lie in bed until noon, have a late lunch, and then sit on a bench by the river and watch the sun go down. Oh, it was perfect. - Yeah. - Your favorite song. - "For All We Know." - For all we know what? - No, that's the name of the song. But you're probably too young to know it. - Yeah.

If I'd have known you were coming, I'd have arranged something more festive. - Please, Mother, I didn't come here for fun. - Is there something wrong? - As a matter of fact, there is. Desmond called me. He's quite beside himself. He said you got rid of him very quickly with some strange excuse. - Did I? - You told him that visits from relatives were not allowed. But according to the manager, that is not true. - Well, the truth is, I called him several times, and he never even bothered to reply. And then he turned up here totally unannounced at a most inopportune moment. - What do you mean? - I had other plans. If you remember, Elizabeth, I came to live in London in order not to be your responsibility, and to accustom myself to a little practical independence. - So, am I right in thinking that you don't want us to come and visit you? - Why, no, dear. No, no, no. Not at all. But it's just, please understand, I am making a life of my own here and quite enjoying it. I thought you'd be glad for me. - Well, I am, but it's my duty to see that you're safe and properly looked-after. - Do you see that distinguished-looking gentleman with the mustache sitting over there? - What about him? - He's asked me to marry him. - What? - Well, don't look so astonished. Naturally, I've turned him down, but a romantic friendship at my time of life is... Well, it's quite invigorating. Really, Mother. Don't you think it's a bit late in life for you to-- I just can't believe you're serious. - Oh, and what can't you believe? That-- Oh! Summers! - Get an ambulance! Now!
