Hello. Im sorry it's been a while since i visited you. You're never far from my thoughts. The reason I haven't visited is that I'm thinking about moving. I thought you might be upset. But you probably already know. I feel it's time for me to move on in life. There's nothing for me here anymore. There hasn't been for a long time. The economy here is horrible. I'm barely getting by. Something has got to give. Maybe you can help me to get out of here. I'm not sure how I'll do this, but I do feel a change happening. Well, that's all for now. I love you. Bill, bill, bill, and another bill. God, I hate this place. It's as if my whole life revolves around my past with no future to look forward to. I try desperately to look to the future but can see nothing but a gray haze. Why can I not see a future for myself? Why can I not envision where I must go from here? Why? (offscreen) Hm, how'd I know you would be here? Hi Beth. Hello Kasey, may I sit here? If you must. Why are you always so grouchy with me? You know you love me. So, whatcha doin? Well, I was writing in my journal. And going on another trip around the world I see. Let's see where we're going today. Chile, France, Germany and... Belgium. Kasey, it seems you should narrow your move down to a specific continent. Dont you think? I have narrowed it down Beth. It's between South America and Europe. Ok, those two continents are only a couple thousand miles apart and separated by an ocean. But I guess that's some progress. I noticed you left "La la Land" off the list. You might want to check into that one. I hear the weather's great this time of year. Ha ha. Don't you have a boyfriend you should be smothering or something? Who? You mean Jeff? No, fuck him. We broke up. What now? I caught him cheating. And this time I caught that asshole red handed. He can't pull that whole "we're just friends" bullshit. What happened? Ok, so get this... I come home early from work yesterday, and he wasn't expecting it and he was doing his laundry. So? So? That lazy jerk never does laundry. I know he was with that cunt Laurie again. He smelled like her perfume last week and I called him on it. He was just covering up the evidence. That was your redhanded proof? You caught him doing his laundry? Um, yea. Don't give me that look. You don't know him like i do. He never does laundry. He always makes me do it. Lazy asshole. It's not funny I thought I was going to marry that asshole. But you've only known him for like two months. So? That's enough. If you say so. And where the fuck were you today? I was having a major meltdown I called and called and you never called back. I was at the cemetery. Visiting your mother? Obviously. How is she? Just kidding. But that still doesn't explain why you didn't answer your phone. I didn't even have my phone with me. Hello? Yes, this is Kasey. Um; 7:30pm? Yea, I could do that. Ok, yea. And what's your name? Ok then. No, there is no on street parking. Alright. I'll see you at 7:30 then. Thank you. Bye. Let me guess, one of your "massage" clients? Yea? So? Nothing. So, how come you never give me a massage? Are you gonna pay me? You. So, what's your name again? I'm, um... I'm Jim. "Jim"? Can I take your coat Jim? No, I'm just fine. Ok. Do you need to use the restroom before we start? Nope. Just fine. Ok. As you can see this is the massage table. Um... you can use that towel to cover yourself if you'd like. I can give you a couple minutes and then I'll come out and adjust the face rest. Sounds great. So, how's the face rest? Oh, it's just fine. Good. So, what kind of massage did you want this evening? (laughs) What kind do you offer? Well, most commonly I do either Swedish or deep tissue. (laughs) I'll try the Swedish? Swedish it is. Just relax. Oh, I'm very relaxed. So, how was the massage? It was good. Good. I'm glad you enjoyed it. Yea... The fucker didn't even tip me. You're late. I know. I'm sorry Allen. Get to work. Hello, can I speak with Greg Shapiro please? Hi Greg, I'm calling from Pallen and Associates on behalf of Silver Fitness Center. It seems you have an outstanding balance on a gym membership... Hello... hello? (dial tone) (voice over) My job sucks. There is absolutely no point to it. I spend four hours a day five days a week trying to collect money from people who don't have it just to make some greedy corporate scumbag rich. I walk down the street and see smiling faces going about their day as if all was well. What do they have to smile about? All I can think about is greed, misery, pestilence and despair. (off screen) Kaaasey. Oh god. Hm, how did I know that you would be back here? I'm always back here Beth. That's how you knew. Kasey, why don't you ever sit in the front room? There are more people out there. That's exactly why I don't sit out there Beth. I don't feel like being around people. You are so anti-social I think that's why you're so depressed. Who said I was depressed? Well I don't have to be hit by lightening to see the obvious. You mean you actually perceived what someone other than you was feeling. (laughs) Touche. Speaking of being depressed I have been so depressed since I broke it off with Jeff. God, he is such an asshole. What now? Well, you know how I told you that I caught him cheating? Um, I remember you caught him doing his laundry. Exactly. So, after i caught him cheating I obviously threw him out. Was he living with you? Well, yea. But you barely know him? That is not the point. The point is that I threw him out. Then threw all his crap in the dumpster. So, at first that asshole kept calling and calling to get back together, right? But then, today, he asked about his stuff. So I told him I threw it out. So now he's screaming about sewing for illegal eviction. Well, he probably can sue you if you threw out all of his stuff. Whatever. I don't even want to think about that asshole or his stuff. So... Let's see. Where are we going today? Germany, Belgium... Wow, China! Kasey, I thought we had this narrowed down to either Europe or South America. I have narrowed it down Beth. I'm not actually planning to go to China. (laughs) That is too funny. You are definitely the only person I've ever met who's addicted to travel guides. I'm not addicted. So, do you have any "massage clients" tonight? I have an 8 o' clock. What is that? What? That doorknob on your finger? Oh, that. (Giggles) This is my insurance policy. What do you mean? This is my grammy's wedding ring. She willed it to me when she died. Is that thing real? Yep, that's why I never have to worry about getting fired from my job. Why? My grammy used to always tell me that if I were ever down on my luck after she passed I could just sell her wedding ring and be more than taken care of for a couple years. What is that thing worth? Let's just say that if I ever wanted to take a couple years off to enjoy myself... I think I should have enough. And you're actually wearing t hat thing? Are you nuts? Oh, I'm not worried. Most people don't know that it's real. (laughs) You are crazy. I know, but I'm 28 now and my hand looks so bare without a ring on it. Hmm. So, isn't it dangerous having total strangers for massage clients? No. Not really. I only do incalls so all my clients come to me. It's not like I'm going to them. So, how come you only do men? I don't... But most woman aren't going to go to a strange man's house and lie face down for an hour. I would. (knocks) Who is it? My name is Detective Eniss. May I speak with you please? Detective? What is this about? This is a police matter sir. Will you please open the door So I can speak with you? What is this about? Are you Kasey Keind? Maybe. Do you have a badge or something? Yea, I'm Kasey. Mr. Keind, I'm here to question all tenants in the building about a series of burglaries. So what is it that you need? This is a nice place you have. Thank you. As I said, I'm here to ask questions about a series of burglaries in the area. The most recent being in this building. Ok. Have you seen this man? This isn't a man, this is a sketch. Please Mr. Keind... This is a serious matter. Will you please take a look at the sketch again, and tell me if you've seen this man? (off screen) Does he look familiar to you Mr. Keind? No. He doesn't look like anyone I've ever seen before. Are you sure Mr. Keind? Yes Det. Eniss, I'm quite sure. Who is he? This man is wanted for questioning about several of the burglaries including the one that took place in this building. Who was robbed in this building? One of your neighbors upstairs was robbed yesterday. Another, in the back coachhouse was robbed two weeks ago. Have you had any break ins or seen any suspicious behavior in or around the building? No. I don't think so. Are you sure? Well, yea. I haven't been robbed or anything if that's what you're asking me. And suspicious behavior? Any unfamiliar individuals hanging around? I really don't know anything. I don't think I can help you. I'm sorry. No, it doesn't seem that you can. Allow me to give you my card Mr. Keind. If you see or hear anything please give me a call. Ok. You have a good day now. You too. (pounding at door) (off screen) Mr. Keind? What now? (off screen) Mr. Keind, heeelloo? (more pounding on door) Mr. Keind? Hello Mr. Hitch. Mr. Keind, I'm not sure what kind of a game you're trying to play with me. But, I have left several messages upon your door and you have yet to return them. I'm not playing any game with you Mr. Hitch, I just don't have the money yet. Oh Mr. Keind, this is a problem isn't it? Hm? This is the third time that you've been late on the rent. In a year. Which means I've been on time most of the time. Mr. Keind, I am renting you a beautiful furnished apartment in a very popular neighborhood well below market value and all that I ask is that you pay the rent on time. Well below market value? Mr. Keind, need I remind you that I have yet to renew your lease? Mmm (giggles). It's up at the end of the month too. I will have the rest of the rent money for you very soon. Soon? As in... tomorrow? I will try. Please do Mr. Keind. Try very hard IF you want to continue your tenancy in this building that is. Oh, and uh... How is that attractive female friend of yours? Beth? Ahh, the lovely Beth. She's fine. I do enjoy seeing her. You will give her my regards? Of course. Good. Well, then I'll be going. Have a good Mr. Keind. Are you ready for me? (off screen) Yes, I am. So, how's the face rest? Do you need me to adjust it? No, it's just fine. So, you wanted a 60 minute deep tissue massage tonight? Yea, that sounds great. Is there anywhere specifically that's bothering you? No, not really. Ok. Let's get started. Great. I'll start by warming up your muscles. I'll go lightly first then deeper. If it's too deep or not deep enough just let me know. (off screen) Ok. Ahh, that feels great. Ok, we're done. Hmm... Can I get you some water? Yea, that would be great. Here's your water. I'll just set it here. So, how long you been doing massage? Um... about six months or so. Do you like it? It's not bad. I'm going to have to clean that table down. I do have another client coming. So what do you like to do when you're not doing this? Why? Oh, just making conversation. I like to do a lot of things. Such as? Such as sleep. You know... it's getting late. It's only a little past 9. Well, for me that's late. Im on a very early schedule. But I thought you said you had another client coming in? I do. And I just want to finish with that client and go to bed. So how big is your cock? You seriously need to put your clothes on, pay me and get out. What the fuck is your problem? I told you to pay me, put your clothes on and get out of my apartment. How bout a quickie before i leave? I've got money. Name your price. I don't want your money, except what you owe for the massage. I want you to put your clothes on pay me and get out of my apartment. Get the fuck off me! I'll pay you whatever you want. Get the fuck off me! Get up! I said get up. Get up. I said get up you asshole. Oh my god. No way. Oh my god. This can not be happening. You've got to be kidding me. Thank you God, this is exactly what I need. Fuck! Fuck! Kasey... Word to the wise, Allen is on a warpath today. Great. You're late; again. I know Allen. I'm sorry. I can stay late today if you want. You know you're not allowed to work more than 20 hours a week now so what's the point? I mean I can stay late for the time I missed today. Forget it. You'll just lose that pay for the week and if this continues you won't have a job to be late to. Hello, can I speak with Maria Sanchez please? Hi Maria, I'm calling on behalf of Pallen and Associates... Hello? Hello? (dial tone) Hello. How are you? I hope you're doing well up in heaven. I'm not doing so well down here. But you probably already know that. I'm really in trouble Mom. I don't even understand how this happened. This is so not my fault. God, why didnt I just call the police right away? They're never going to believe me now. Please, if there's any way you can help me please help me. I don't know what to do. Please send me some kind of a sign. Who is that fucker? (off screen) How's the dead guy? Excuse me? You heard me. How's the dead guy? You know; the dead guy in your apartment. I don't know what you're talking about. I think you do. Fuck you. Eww. (phone rings) Hello? Hi Kasey. Beth? What ya doing? Um, nothing. Well, I'm over at Ready Coffee if you want to come over. You're there now? Yep. Um, yea. I'll be there in a minute. Cool. See ya in a bit. Bye. So this woman on the train today was seriously pissing me off. From the minute she gets on the bitch is staring at me right? So I'm sitting there minding my own business and everytime I look up I see her looking at me. So finally I got pissed and said "Take a picuture lady, it'll last longer". So, she gets all pissy and gets in my face. She's lucky, she doesn't even know. I'll cut a bitch! Um... hello! Kasey, are you even listening to me? Yea, I heard you Beth. You'll cut a bitch. Yea, that's right. And I should have cut that bitch. Kasey, what is your problem today? You're totally out of it. Even more than normal. It's nothing. I just have a lot on my mind. Let me guess. Taking another trip around the world in your mind? No Beth. It's nothing like that. Well, what is it then? Beth... I have to tell you something. What? (off screen) What? What? What do you need to tell me? Who is that? Who is that Kasey? No one. What do you mean no one? Why are you staring at him? It's no one. Well then why are you staring at him? I wasn't. I thought he looked like someone I used to know. But it's not. Kasey, you are really getting on my nerves today. So, what is it that you needed to tell me? What do you mean? What do I mean? You were just about to tell me something right before you started staring at that guy. Beth, forget it. It's noghting. Argh. You are really getting on my nerves. I have to pee. Who are you? And what do you want? What do I want? Yea, what do you want? I don't want anything. I'm just curious about why there's a half naked dead man lying in your living room. Are you? I am. Well, you know what I'm curious about? What's that? What the hell were you doing in my apartment? That's what I'm curious about. And, I think Detective Eniss would also be curious to know. Who? Detective Eniss. The detective that came to my apartment looking for you. I've seen you around my building. And you don't live there do you? Look maybe we can help each other? Help each other? Yea. I don't know you. What makes you think I'd want help from you? It seems like we're both in a bit of trouble. Fuck you. Kasey, who the fuck is that? I already told you Beth. It's no one. Well then why were you over there talking to him? It's nothing! If you say that one more time I'm going to strangle you. I just went over there to tell him he looks like a friend I used to have. I thought maybe they were related. But they're not. Who do you think he looks like? Beth just forget it. It's no one you know. What-ever. Beth, I actually have to go. Go? You just got here. I know but... I just don't feel well. I think I'm just going to go home and take a bath. Well, can I come with you? No Beth. I'll probably just take a nap after anyway. Fine. You're totally getting on my nerves today anyway. Ok. Bye Beth. Bye. (knocking) What do you want? I thought I told you to get lost. I want to talk to you. Come in. So what do you want? Like I said, maybe we can help each other. How? I could help you with your little problem. How? I can help you get rid of the body. And what's in it for you? Do you have a shower? Yea. If you let me take a shower I'll help you get rid of that body. That's all you want; is to take a shower? Oh yea, that's all. Why should I trust you? I don't know you and you're a theif. Well, it's either that or you can try to get rid of it on your own. (singing) Love having you here in spite of a voice that comes in the night and repeats in my ear. Don't you know you fool, you never can win... Use your mentality, wake up to reality. But each time I do just the thought of you makes me stop before I begin because I've got you under my skin. So, how long has he been laying there? Since yesterday. What happened? It was an accident. Out of control massage client huh? How'd you know? Well, he's in a towel and I saw the massage table. I put two and two together. So, how'd he end up dead? I gave him a massage and then he tried to force himself on me. I pushed him and he hit his head against the fireplace. And that killed him? Well I guess so. That's messed up. This guy looks like a pervert. Yea, pretty much. Maybe he got what he deserved, huh? Maybe, but I'm the one who's fucked. Why didn't you call the cops. I don't even know. I don't trust them. And it's too late now. They're never going to believe me now. No man, you're right about that. You can't trust no fucking cops. What's wrong with his face? I don't know. Man, you better get rid of this before it starts to stink. And exactly how can I do that? Simple, you cut it up put the pieces into plastic bags then take it out to the country and you bury it. Cut it up? Are you crazy? I'm not cutting that thing up. Well what are you going to do? Just let it lay here and rot? I don't know what I'm gonna do. Obviously. Ok. You help me drag him to the bathroom and I'll cut him up. You're gonna cut him up? That's what I said. And what's in it for you; now that you've had your shower? Look, I've been living in my car for a while and I'm sick of it. I need a place to crash while I get some money together to skip town. If you let me crash here for a while, I'll help you. You wanna crash here? Yea. The police are looking for a man fitting your descrition and they've been here asking questions. And what did you tell them? Nothing. I told them nothing. Good. So, I'll lay low... VERY low. I'm in a jam here and so are you. You help me, I help you. It's either that or you can cut up the body yourself. And what are you gonna use to cut him up? You got a saw? Ok, now what? Do you have the garbage bags and plastic gloves? The garbage bags are in the kitchen. The plastic gloves are right there. Now what? Now, I cut him up. Be my guest. You better take off those clothes. Unless you want blood all over them. Ok. Are you sure that thing is not leaking? Yea I'm sure. This shit is going into my car. You think I want blood all over it? That's the least of my worries. Where are the other bags? I took them to the car already. So where you going to bury that? Don't worry. It will be outside of the city. I'll bury them very deep. Do you have the shovel? It's in the car. So when will you be back? In a couple of hours. You'll be here when I get back? I'm not going anywhere. We are tied to each other now. Are we? (knocking) Did you get rid of it? Yea, I got rid of it. Where? Don't worry. Like I said, it's outside of the city. It's burried deep. But where? Don't worry about it. I wanna know where. What? Do you want me to draw you a map? No, just tell me. It's nowhere where anyone will ever find it. You better be right. What did you do with his clothes? Nothing. They're still here in the bedroom. Why? Man, you got to get rid of that shit. Fine. Did you go through his shit? No. Why? Fuck man. Jackpot! How much is there? There's over 500 dollars here. Fuck you man. I cut the fucker up, and I took him out and burried him. I get half. Fine. Then give me half. And give me that money clip. We are cutting up those credit cards. You are not using those. What do you think I am an idiot? Who carries this much cash on them? A lot of my clients do. They come for massage, but a lot are hoping for something "extra". Do they get it? No. You see what happened to the last guy who tried. (laughs) Thank god that asshole had this money. My landlord is getting ready to kick me out for being late on rent. This money is going to save my ass. And yours. I'll cut this shit up and get rid of it tomorrow. Ok. So we pulled it off. What now? How long do you need to stay here? Hopefully not long. Just until I can get the money together to get back to Europe. Where are you from? I was born in Italy but I've lived all over. So what are you doing here? It's a long story man. Ok. My name is Marco by the way. Kasey. Good to meet you. Yea, same. I need to get back to Europe before I end up in prison. I think I need to leave the country as well. Especially after this. Oh yea? Yea. So maybe we can help each other out again. How? We both need to leave the country... Maybe we've stumbled across the perfect scam to make some quick money. What do you mean? What do you think I mean? I don't know. That's why I asked you. How long you been doing this massage thing man? Six months or so. Why? Is this the first guy you killed? I did not kill him. It was an accident. And it was his fault. Tomato tomahto. What is your point? I was thinking about this when I was out burrying that shit. We both need to make some quick money right? Yea? And these guys that come to you have money right? Yea? So, we lure these pervert fucks here with your massage scam and rob them. Scam? What I do is not a scam. The only one trying to run a scam here is you. What ever man. What ever it is It's a great setup. You are totally whack. (laughs) Do you want to leave the country or not? Yea, I do. But your plan is ridiculous. Oh yea, We're going to lure these "pervert fucks" here rob them and just let them go so they can bring the police back here. Maybe we should also tell them about the guy we cut up for good measure. Ok. You're right. That won't work. We can't let them go. Ok... So, we lure these pervert fucks here we kill them and then we take their money. Are you crazy? What happened with that guy was an accident. Do you understand? An accident. I am not a murderer. I didn't say that you were a murderer, but you said it yourself that pervert deserved to die. I didn't say that you did. Yes, but you agreed. Even if that fucker did deserve to die that doesn't mean all of my clients derserve that. I wouldn't lose any sleep if they did die. But that doesn't mean that I am going to kill them. Leave that to me then. You're serious? You're actually talking about this? You're crazy. Maybe. But you know it's a good idea. Don't you? Look... It's late, and I have to work in the morning. I am this close to being fired from my job and then I will be fucked. If you need to stay here tonight you can sleep out here on the couch, or whatever. But I'm going to bed. Fine. So, do you need anything before I go to bed? Nah man, I'm fine. Ok. You're not going to try to kill me or something while I'm asleep are you? You're the one who has killed someone not me. What the hell are you doing in here? It's cold out there in that living room man. Well get a blanket. Where are the blankets. There's one right there at the foot of my bed. What about a pillow? Thank you. You're welcome. Now get out of my room. (knocking) (off screen) Mr. Keind? (knocking) Mr. Keind? Mr. Keind? (knocking) (pounding on door) Mr. Keind, are you there? (pounding) Mr. Keind? Hi. Mr. Keind, I don't appreciate having to track you down this way but you have yet to pay me the rest of your rent money and I can no longer tolerate this... I have the rest of the money Mr. Hitch. Oh, you do? Well, wonders never cease. No, they don't do they? So, I'll just bring that down to your office on my way to work. Good. Very good then Mr. Keind. And, um... How is that attractive female friend of yours? Beth? Yes Beth, the lovely Beth. How is she? She's doing fine Mr. Hitch. Good. Very good. You will give her my regards of course? Of course. Well, then I shall see you in my office Mr. Keind. Ok. Who was that? My idiot landlord. What a freak. Yea, tell me about it. So, I need to get dressed and go to work. What are you planning to do today? I'm not sure yet. Well, were you planning to stay here? I was hoping to. Well I only have one set of keys. You can leave the keys with me. I'll make a copy. You want keys to my home? I don't think it's asking much considering. Do you? I guess I have no choice. But you better not rob me. Man I'm not going to rob you. And don't rob anyone else in this building either. What do you think I am an idiot? Well for my sake, I hope not. Fine. So I'll leave the keys with you. But I get off work at noon so you need to be here when I get home. And if you leave use the back door. I don't want anyone to see you. And LOCK it when you come in AND out. Yes sir. (off screen) Ms. Garcia, I understand you are unemployed. But I can't set up payments for less than $25 per month. Yes I understand but my system won't let me do that. Ok, fine. I'll wait until next week and call you then. Well you call me then and let me know when you can set up payments. Ok, fine. Thank you Ms. Garcia. What the fuck is your problem? How bout a quickie before I leave? I've got money. I don't want your money. Pay me, and get out of my apartment. Get the fuck off me. Kasey! (phone rings) Pallen and Associates, Kasey speaking. Hello? (dial tone) Into the conference room. Now! Come in and have a seat. Kasey. Why did I hear you tell Ms. Garcia that she could give you a call when she was ready to set up a payment? What was I supposed to say to her? Agression Kasey. AGRESSION! That is what it takes to do this job! You do not politely ask these losers to call you when they're ready to pay. You call them and harass them and then you harass them some more until they pay up! That is what I'm paying you to do! These "losers" as you call them, don't have any money that's why they aren't paying. I don't wanna hear that crap. You do your job or you're fired! Fuck you Allen! Fuck you and fuck this job. Was that aggressive enough for you? (Voice over) I'm being consumed. I'm fucked. I'm being consumed. I'm fucked. I have to fight back. I have to fight back. (Voice over) AGRESSION! That is what it takes to do this job. Marco, open the door. What are you doing home so early? I thought you got off at noon. I quit my job. You quit? Why? I quit because it's a piece of shit. So now I'm jobless and a murderer thanks to you. Thanks to me? I didn't tell you to kill that guy. I just helped you get rid of his stinking body. So how do we kill our first pervert fuck? What about their cars? I don't think that's going to be a big issue. The parking around here is terrible so most of my clients take public transportation or park in the paid parking garages. None of those are close to here so there's no way to trace them here. Ok. My cellphone is prepaid so it's not in my name. Very nice. The situation is kind of perfect. What do you mean? Well, most of my clients are married so they go out of their way to cover their tracks. A lot are just in town on business so that just makes it better for us. Ok. Good. So how we gonna kill these guys? You just get them face down on the table leave the rest to me. What are you going to use? Anything. As long as its quick. That cast iron skillet in your kitchen would work well a knife, whatever. A knife? Yea. That would not be quick. It would be if you put it in the right spot. I don't want this to be messy. It wont be. And then we just cut up the bodies and bury them like with the other guy? Of course. I'll bury them in different spots. What if someone finds the body parts? They won't. What if they do. They won't. And even if they do we don't have any connection to these guys. By the time they piece things together if they ever do we'll be long gone. Hm. I mean, the pieces are every where the cars every which way. Think about how long it takes the cops to solve anything really. (phone rings) Hello? Yea, this is Kasey. Yea, I have openings for tonight. Sixty minutes? Yea, I could do that. Um, what did you want to know about it? Is it sensual? Yes, it's very sensual? Yea, I can do that at the end. But it's gonna cost you extra. 10 o clock then? What's your name? Bob? Ok Bob. Yes, 10 o clock then. No, there's no on street parking. I will text you the address. Bye. Man, he almost heard you. No he didn't. Bob? Now what kind of a name is Bob? All these guys have names like Burt, Bob, Bill. Something really generic. They never give me their real names. So he's coming at 10? Yea. We better get ready. What? I can't believe I'm getting myself into this. Look, Kasey. You're not getting yourself into something you're getting yourself out of something. So Bob, where'd you park? I didn't. I took a cab. That's always more convenient. I didn't want to have to deal with parking around here. I don't blame you. So let me take your coat. As you can see there's a towel there you can cover with if you'd like I'll give you a couple minutes to get situated then I'll be out to adjust the face rest. Sounds good. Alright. Ok. He's in there getting ready. Give me a couple minutes to get him relaxed before you come in. Ok. What are you going to use? I'll use this. What ever. Just give me a couple minutes and I'll signal when it's time to come in. Ok. So Bob, how's the face rest? It's fine. What kind of massage did you want this evening? Well what kind do you do? Most commonly I do Swedish or deep tissue. Either one is fine. I just can't wait for the finale. Me neither Bob. Me neither. Mmm, that feels good. (coughs) (coughs) (coughs) Are you Ok? I'm fine Bob. I just have a little tickle in my throat. Hey, why'd you stop? (THUD!) You sure took your time about coming in. I was practically ready to kill him myself. I heard you coughing but you didn't tell me what the signal would be I didn't know if it was real or not. Did you find the wallet? Yep. How much is there? This guy had a lot of money. Here's your share. Not bad for five minutes of work huh? At this rate we'll be out of here in no time. You have no idea how badly I want to get out of here. Oh I do man. I do. Ok. Now the hard part. We have to cut up that body. No, wait. There's something that I want to do first. What? You'll see. When did you get that? I got it earlier. When? Don't worry about it. I would like to propose a toast. A toast? Yes, a toast. To the perfect crime. The perfect crime. (doorbell) God, what does she want? Who is it? Ha ha Kasey. Open the door. What are you doing here? I wanted to see what you were up to. Have you ever heard of a telephone? Well excuse me. I didn't realize that I needed to make an appointment just to see you. And you never answer my calls anymore anyway. What's your problem? I don't have a problem Beth. I just haven't been feeling very social since I lost my job. Kasey, you're never feeling very social. What have you been doing? I feel like I haven't talked to you in forever. Not much. Sitting around reading travel guides and looking for a job. That's it? Pretty much. God, that sounds boring. What about your massage clients? I've had a few. I see. Well, you were acting like a total freak the last time we were at the cafe. What can I say? I was out of sorts. So what's going on with you and Jeff? Oh. We're kind of back together. You are? Well not really. But we're fucking. Ah, I see. Yea, we had a knock down drag out the other night. He pulled my hair, I bit him; and then we fucked. Sounds like a match made in heaven. Yea, you know it's amazing sometimes you meet some one and you find yourself doing things you would never do otherwise. Yea, tell me about it. What? Nothing. I see you're still wearing that ring. Yea, I've kinda gotten used to it. Shouldn't that be in a safe or something? Kasey, you are such a worry wart. So, this is the infamous massage table? Yep. So, has anyone ever been naked on this table? Not without a sheet on it. So they have then? What's with your sudden interest in my massage table? Oh, I'm just curious. Beth, I have to use the bathroom. Thank you for announcing that Kasey. I just want to make sure you don't hurt yourself on the table while I'm in the bathroom. Very funny. Mmmm. Ahhhh! Ahhhh! AHHHH!!!!! Who the fuck are you? Who the fuck are you you crazy bitch? What the hell is going on out here? Kasey who the fuck is this? Um... Beth. This is my friend Steve. I am so embarrassed. He just saw me half naked. What were you doing half naked? What the fuck just happened in here? I have no idea. Who is that crazy bitch? Beth, that's Beth. Ok. She was not supposed to see you. Well that's not my fault. Go in the bedroom. What? Just go in the fucking bedroom. Kasey, who the fuck was that guy? I already told you who it was. It's my friend Steve. Steve? Yea. Steve. That's that guy that was at Ready Coffee the other day isn't it? Who? Kasey, don't play dumb with me. That's that fucking guy you kept staring at and I asked who he was and you kept saying "no one". Oh. Yea, that's him. No shit that was him. So he has the key to your apartment? No. Who said that? Well how did he get in then? You were in the bathroom. Beth I don't know. Who cares? Why does it matter? So is this why you never answer my calls anymore? You've been hanging out with him? Are you in love with him Kasey? Well are you? What is your damn problem? I wanna know what's going on and I wanna know fucking now! I know something's going on with you and that guy. Goddammit Beth. I swear to God. You're gonna poke your nose in my business at the wrong place and wrong time and I swear. What Kasey? What? Fuck you! So what is her problem? She was not supposed to see you. And now she also remembers you from the cafe. Well who's fault is that? What are you doing back so soon? The ground was softer today than usual. It didn't take as long. No one saw you buring that shit in the middle of the day did they? Of course not. I was way the hell out in the middle of nowhere. Good. And you left the back door unlocked again. Ok. I'll lock it next time. So what was her fucking problem? I don't know. She's crazy. Tell me about it. She's in love with me or something. But you're gay? I'm not in the mood for any bullshit tonight Marco. We kill this mother fucker cut him up and then I'm going to bed. What is wrong with you tonight? Nothing. I'm just getting tired of this. I admit it was kind of exciting for a minute. But now it's just starting to get on my nerves. What? Are you afraid? No. I'm not. Ok. Cause we are close to having the money we need. I just want to be done with this and go. Soon. Soon. (doorbell) Go in the kitchen. Wow, you are cute. Thank you. What kind of massage did you want this evening? I don't care. Just as long as you're naked when you do it. All that comes after. After what? After the massage. Oh yea? Yep. Can't wait. You brought money right? Don't worry, I have money. Good. So what kind of massage do you want? Do you do Swedish? I do. Then give me one of those. Swedish it is. We really scored with this guy. There's over 700 dollars here. And an unlimited ride transit card. We are making good progress. A couple more like this and we'll be ready. Good. (SCREAM!) What are you doing? What are you doing? (Whack!) Stop! He's dead. Stop! Stop you fucking idiot! Fuck you. (knocking) Can I come in? You can do what you want. What happened? What do you mean? Why did you keep hitting that pervert when you knew he was dead? Why? Now you think I am a psycho? What? I didn't say that. Have you heard me use the word psycho? I just wanted to know why you kept hitting him that's all. I don't know why. It pissed me off... It pissed me off that he scared me. Yea. That mother fucker scared the hell out of me. Why did you call me an idiot? What? You called me a fucking idiot. Oh. I'm sorry. It just freaked me out how you kept hitting him like that. My piece of shit father used to call me idiot all the time. Stupido idiota he would say. I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. I hated that man. He was a complete waste of flesh. Where is he now? Dead. He finally drank himself to death about five years ago. I'm sorry. I'm not. Now he can answer for all the things he put me through. I understand how you feel. I hate my father too. Is he living? Yea. Well, kind of. What do you mean? He's in prison serving a life sentence. For what? For killing my mother. Are you serious? Do you think I would joke about something like that? No. No. What happened? My mom found out that he had been molesting me for 4 years. She was gonna call the police so he killed her. That's terrible. Yea. But want are you gonna do? Yea. Exactly. Marco. I don't want to get caught. Neither do I. Why would you say that? Because I'm starting to get a bad feeling. What do you mean? I'm starting to feel like we're gonna get caught. Kasey. We are not going to get caught. You keep saying that but you don't know. I know. We are this close to having the money we need. We will leave soon. I don't want us to get caught. We wont. Hello Mom. It's Kasey. I hope you're doing well in heaven. I'll probably be leaving here soon. So I may not talk to you for a while. At least not here. But I guess I don't need to be here to talk to you do I? Well... I found a way to get out of this shithole city. I hope you're not too disappointed in me. I know you understand why I'm doing what I'm doing. But Mom if you could help me just one more time. Please help me and Marco to escape and not get caught. Marco is kind of crazy. But deep down he's not a bad person. I think you'd actually like him if you got to know him. But I don't want us to get caught and I'm afraid that we might. So please Mom please don't let us get caught. Please make it so that we don't get caught. Please Mom. Please make it so that we don't get caught. Please make it so that we don't get caught. Please make it so that we don't get caught. (crying) (pounding at door) (off screen) Mr. Keind? Mr.Keind? Are you there? (pounding at door) Mr. Keind? (pounding at door) Chill the fuck out. Mr. Keind I really don't appreciate that kind of language. What do you want? Mr. Keind you never got back to me about renewing your lease. Mr. Hitch I will not be renewing the lease. Oh really? Is there a reason for that Mr. Keind? Kasey. KASEY! My fucking name is Kasey. Mr. Keind there is no call for that kind of language. There is call for it. You're annoying and your a fucking asshole and I've been dying to tell you off since I moved in here. Well, then It is a good thing that you'll be moving out isn't it? Yea, it is. But remember Mr. Keind if there are any damages to the apartment. I will have to bill you for it! Up yours. (knocking) You've got to be kidding me. (knocking) What do you want? Mr. Keind it's Detective Eniss. Mr. Keind are you there? Mr. Keind we spoke before about the burglaries in the area. Can I speak with you? This really isn't a good time. I'm busy. This will only take a minute Mr. Keind. I already told you I don't know anything. I know that Mr. Keind. But so far we don't have any solid leads so I'm reinterviewing everyone. There haven't been any new burglaries have there? No Mr. Keind. Not since the last one in this building. Well that's good. Maybe the guy left the area. Yes, we've considered that. But I again wanted to ask if you've seen any suspicious people around the building or on the street. There have been sightings of a tall dark haired man fitting the sketch I showed you before each of the burglaries. Ms. Johnson upstairs saw that man standing outside with a blue duffel bag before the first burglary. Mr. Neil, in the back coachhouse, saw that man on this street just before the second burglary. Kasey, you wouldn't believe how hard the ground was today. It was shit. (THUD!) MARCO! What the fuck. Who the fuck is that? It's that cop. Who? It's that piece of shit cop who was here asking questions about you before. He's a cop? Yea. He's a cop. SHIT! Now we are fucked. Does he know about the murders? No. I don't think so. He was just asking more dumb questions about the break ins. Ok. So they probably don't know about it then. We have to go. We can't go. We don't have enough money yet. Kasey, we just killed a cop. We have to go! No one can trace him here. He said he was reinterviewing everyone. We just killed a cop. We have to go! I know that. FUCK! Ok. We have to have everything packed and ready to go by tonight. Who the hell is that? I don't know. Just be quiet and hope they go away. Are they gone? I don't know. I think so. So we cut this mother fucker up bury him and leave tonight. But we really don't have enough money yet. What are we gonna do? (SCREAM!) How long do you think it will take to drive to Philly from here? I'd say about 15 hours if we don't stop. Ok. Benissimo. I'll get rid of the car there. Marco. Clean that up it's bleeding. Oh shit. So we're flying directly to Paris? Yea. From there we can decide where we want to go. Oh... How much do you think we can get for this? I think we should have enough. KASEY! Kasey please tell me that when we end up where ever we're going it's not going to be cold. Beth. What took you so long? We were about to leave without you. Well I'm here. Just tell me please that where ever we're going it's not going to be cold. I beg of you. I'm finally getting out of this shithole and just don't want to do cold. Fine Beth. Nowhere cold. That's all I'm asking Kasey. I don't think it's asking much. If I'm going to be running for my life I just don't want to do it somewhere cold. Is that asking so much? No Beth. Come on you guys. Let's go! But that still leaves us with a lot of options. Spain, France, Greece, Italy. No wait. Not Italy. I've had it with Italians. And by the way, I do not appreciate you rushing me as much as you did blah blah blah...
