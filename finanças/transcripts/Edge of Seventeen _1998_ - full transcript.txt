Guess what Frieda told me. She overheard Angie and Rod talking in the walk-in. Rod's gay. And you know how Angie supposedly has that boyfriend John or whatever? Frieda said that um, John is really Joanne. I was like, what, did they assign all the gay people to the grub wagon or something? Hello? What? I don't know. I hate how my hair looks. What? Your hair?
