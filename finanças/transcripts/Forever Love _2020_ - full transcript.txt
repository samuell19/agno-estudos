No, of course I'm sure. I mean, it's not practical. We have no plan. I don't even know where I'm going. That's not us. Well, we can just have fun. Remember fun? I might. What do you want to do? I don't know. I guess we could do whatever we want. [screeching tires, crash] [mournful music] [upbeat music] [Steve] Hi. You're new here? I'm new here too. [Jan] Do you want potatoes? Yes yes.

It's not good. Is he alive? Yeah. But he's in really bad shape. They're gonna tell me more after he gets out of surgery. Okay. [Michele] Hey mom. Hey I- I talked to the EMTs. You were extremely lucky. You know that. It could've been much worse. That's not luck, sweetheart. Okay. Did they happen to give you the name of dad's surgeon. Oh you know I- with everything, and it happened so fast, I don't think I got that. You know, they just rushed him into surgery. It's fine, It's fine. I can find out. Did they give you any like, discharge papers. Or did they give you any paperwork? -Mh-mm. -Okay. Yep. Good. That's what I need. Okay. I'm gonna go make sure they take care of dad. Hang on. Sweetie. This isn't your hospital. I'm sure the doctors know what they're doing. Mom, the problem is that because I work in a hospital, unfortunately I know that some doctors don't know what they're doing, so I'm just gonna go talk to them. That's all, just get some information. I will be nice and I will be right back. It's okay. She's probably gonna push the surgeon out and do it herself. She would. She would do that. Yes she would. She'd do it well. I just want to see dad. Me too, sweetheart. ♪ [Steve] Hi. Corn? I like your hair. Very funny. I can just tell you have nice hair. [Steve chuckles] [Robbie] Move on up, man. She's not buying it. I don't date GIs. Yet. Ever. Until. It's not gonna happen. You say that now. Do you want the corn or not. Yes. Yes I do. [giggles] What? Oh, he wants a hair net. [Julie] We're breaking for lunch. So I'm going out with that guy Robbie on Friday. The tall one? The air man? Yes. Speaking of airmen. Don't start with that. He's so cute, and Robbie knows him. He says he's a good guy. Seriously, what's your problem. My father won't approve. I'm not asking you to marry him. Do you think he's cute. I think he's trouble. Yes or no. Some people might say he's handsome in the right light when he's in uniform. So you do think he's cute. Okay, fine yes, I think he's somewhat cute, Okay? So then your father doesn't have to know. You don't get it. He said if he catches me dating a GI, he'll send me to live with my grandma in Nebraska. Well, do you want to go to Nebraska? No. Then I guess we'll have to keep it a secret. I guess I can always meet another boy. [Jim] Hey. Hi. How was your shift today? It was fine. Fine. [chuckles] Is that the age we're at now? I ask you how your day is and all I get back is 'fine'. The other dads tell me about it, I was hoping my girl might treat me a little differently. It's just a regular day. Hungry people. Food. Just a job. Well, if you're doing it, I want to hear about it. I serve potatoes. Hours of potatoes. It's crushingly boring. Still happy you asked? Absolutely. How they treating you over there? Fine. Just been a couple months. Any of the GIs getting too friendly with you? Nothing I can't handle. Oh, so they are? You know how I feel about you dating. Who said I'm dating anyone? Really? Really.

That's all. Who said I am? Are you? No. Great. Mom dated you didn't she? Look, sweetie, I'm only saying this because I care about you. All those GIs I trained at Lachland, spending so much time with other young men or getting yelled at by me, months without even seeing a woman, it's gotta change him. They forget about their mothers and their sisters. They forget how to treat a woman. They're never gonna commit. They don't know how to handle a relationship, and I know that sounds harsh, but this is exactly why I have to tell you. I don't want anyone hurting my little girl. You understand? Okay. You promise? Promise. Promise me what. Promise I won't date anyone in the military. Thank you. Go on. ♪ I heard you wanted to go out with me. Oh look at that. We need more baked beans. I really like your hair. Will you go out with me? Squash? Sure. Apple sauce? Can I serve you some food? No. Okay then, I'll see you Monday. You can see him now. He's still sedated from surgery. Just ... Just what? Just be prepared. [machines beeping] [sobbing] You know, it's very likely that he can hear you. Is he okay? What's gonna happen? [Doctor] I'll give you a few more moments, then we should just let him rest. [sobbing] You're gonna be okay. [upbeat music] Can I take you to the movies? No. What are you doing Monday? Washing my hair. Go for a walk? No. Your eyes are beautiful. Not a chance. Thursday? Washing my hair again. Friday? Doing laundry. Do you like me? Nope. Sunday. Maybe. Maybe is better than a no. So where are we at post-surgery? Well, the medication is keeping his heart going. Breathing on a respirator. I mean, his mind is still there. He's conscious. But he's paralyzed, and his body's failing him everywhere. So, what happens next? We have some tough decisions to make and he's only getting worse. Could you just give us a few minutes to talk about it privately? Of course, of course. So he's gonna be in a wheelchair, right? Mom. [Jan] I'll learn to take care of him. We have a one-story house. There are no stairs, we have a walk-in shower already, we can make the whole place wheelchair accessible, we can put a ramp. Thought I'd just- Mom. Mom. What? I don't think you're understanding. What am I not understanding? You're scaring her. Okay, I just don't think that you're hearing maybe what's actually happening. Dad isn't breathing on his own. His heart isn't beating on its own, Okay? And so this is not just take him home and buy a wheelchair. This is much more serious than that. I heard what the doctor said, I was listening. But he could improve. It's just not likely. Miracles can happen. I should be in a hospital bed myself right now, I should be, and I'm not. I'm sorry, but a miracle is not going to happen. Okay? He's just, he's not going to get better. What happened to you? I'm just- I'm just trying to be the grown-up at the table. Okay? Look, you can have hope, and you should, but all I want you to know is that having hope is not going to change a medical diagnosis, Okay? And I'd think a lawyer should understand that! And I would expect you to remember where we came from. [Jan] Okay, girls. Sweetie. I know you're scared. It's okay. We have to place our faith in love to watch over your father. You know that.

You don't have to interrogate her, honey. You sure? [Marion] She wouldn't lie to us. I'll be back before 10:00. Alright. [door closes] Relax. What if he tries to kiss you? I'm not gonna let him. Robbie kissed me on our first date. That's because you're easy. I'm only doing this because you pushed me into it. That's what you need to tell yourself. By the end of the night I'm gonna have to pull you off him. Not a chance. -[chuckling] ♪ Hi boys. Hey, girls. Should we go? I actually don't really wanna see a movie. I'd rather just hang and talk. If that's okay. I'd love to just sit and talk. Okay then. You two coming? You go ahead. Alright, you two have fun. [laughs] There's a little park down this way. So. You... I'm not making out with you. Who said you were? I know what "just sit and talk," means to boys. No, not me. I just wanna get to know you. I hope you don't get into trouble for sneaking out to see me like this. Robbie told me. It'll be fine. Look. I just think you're beautiful, and cute. And I just wanna spend time with you. Is that so awful? No, it's not. Good. It's just that my dad used to train recruits. He told me what GIs were like. He's not wrong. There are a lot of guys who don't know how to treat a lady. But I'm not one of those guys. So, Jan. What's your story? Unless you plan on being a career lunch lady. No. I wanna go to college. I want a real career. But my parents always say I'm just a girl. They actually say that? Yeah. My mom says it a lot. Well, you're not just a girl to me. My mom, we have some things we disagree on, too. That's sort of why I joined the Air Force. To get away? Maybe. Do you like it? I do. It's not like back home. If you say you're gonna do something, you do it. People are responsible for their actions, no accountable. That's why I like it. You sound like my dad. Sorry? That's not always a bad thing. Oh, shoot, what time is it? Why? I promised my dad I'd be home early. I have a question. Please don't lie to me. Okay. Do you have a girlfriend? What? Where did that come from? Some guys think it's okay to talk to more than one girl at a time. I'm not one of those guys. You are the only girl I wanna be talking to. [Robbie] Last call, Romeo. Robbie! [Robbie laughs] [Julie] Sorry. We really do have to go though, Jan. We're already late, my mom will be waiting up for me. [Jan] Why didn't you come get me sooner? Robbie and I- talked- a little in the theatre after the movie finished. Yeah, we had a really nice- talk in there. Seems like you two were about to talk, too. Bye. Can I call you sometime? Okay. [Robbie] Later, babe. [Julie] Come on. Sorry man, I tried to stall her for you. Jan, wait a second. Wait a second. [kiss] Bye. Bye. [giggling] Yeah! Good one. Yeah. Come on. Nice one, dude! You did it! [Steve] Get out of here. [Doctor] He's awake, and responsive. That's great! Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, what are you doing? No, no, no. You have a strained shoulder, you have to put that back on. I don't want your father worrying about me. There's a reason they told you to wear it in the first place, I mean he's not ... Okay. Come on, let's go see him. Here, I got this. Hey there. [Terri] Dad. Daddy. [Michele] Mom, he can't feel his arms. But if you wanted to touch him on his face, above his chin, he can feel there. I'm here. [Terri] You look good. Sweetheart, I love you. Sweetheart, I love you. Now who's easy? Stop it. I thought you weren't gonna kiss him. He's not like the others. Why, because he told you so? It's not that he told me, it's how he looked at me when he said it. I don't know, I can't explain it. Something about the way he looks at me, I understand him. I think you're gonna see him again. I might. We had a really good time at the movies. We got ice cream after. Well it's almost 11:00. It was really good ice cream. Really good. Okay. Good night. I looked like that after our first date. Yeah. That's what worries me. [laughs] Relax. Delicious. Thank you, darling. I wanna have a friend come eat with us sometime. Of course. Which friend? He's a college student. A college student you're dating? No. No, he's just a good friend. Right. We think it's great you want your friends to come meet us honey, he's welcome anytime. Great. Great. Thank you Lord for these gifts we are about to receive from your bounty. In Jesus' name, amen. [Marion] Amen. [Jim] Amen. Amen. [Jim] Alright, Steve. Couldn't help but notice your haircut. High and tight. I like keeping it short. Right. So, Steve, where are you from? Los Angeles. Oh, we know lots of people there. Where did you live? Brentwood. Mm-hmm. You a rich kid? [Steve] No, uhm, everything there was my dad's, not mine. It's all gone now anyway. What, he blow it all? It's a long story. What about you? You have a job? Uhh... He's a college student. I told you that. Yes you did. And how did you two meet? [Steve] Well, we... He hangs out at the ice cream parlour. [Jim] Well, Steve, I guess you can go home. Seems like Jan has all the answers for you. She's a good listener. Steve might tutor me in math. Why would he do that? So I can be ready for college math. Oh, honey. Secretaries don't need math. Well maybe I don't wanna be just a secretary. I see. So your mommy's job isn't good enough for you, is that what you're saying? Never mind. This pot roast is excellent, Mrs. Nichols. Thank you Steve. You're welcome. [Steve] Thank you so much. I'd be happy to clean up. Oh, don't be silly. No, that's very kind of him. Go on, then. Jim! The boy just got a free meal the least he could do is the dishes. [Steve] I'd be happy to. [Jim] Hop on it son. Here you go. Hey, while you're at it, you wanna give her a fill up there? Dad. Sure. Thank you. Too much. He seemed in good spirits today. That's great, but unfortunately medically, he's not improving. Does Steve have a living will? Why do they call it living when it's only about dying? [Doctor] But does he have one? [Jan] Yeah. Who has power of attorney? [Jan] I do. What would he want you to do? He'd wanna be given every chance to live. To be here for his girls. He can react to us, I mean that has to mean something, surely, doesn't it? Unfortunately it doesn't. But what if there is any chance? And if there's not? The hospital would recommend moving him to hospice. Why do we have to move him? He's been through enough already, hasn't he? Ma'am, hospice is for... I know. I know. I know what hospice is. My husband is not a piece of furniture. Of course not. [Jan] I feel like you just want me to kill him... No, mom, no. [Jan] Like you want me to shut off the machines and the medicine. Mom. We don't want you to do anything you don't want to. But the fact of the matter is no matter how well we take care of him, he'll never be able to function on his own. He hates hospitals. He always has. We don't have to discuss this now, but we do have to make a decision. [Jan] You can talk to me doctor. As I said, I have power of attorney, and I will decide what happens to my husband. Of course. I think we need to be alone. You know about a year ago, I lost my wife. And I didn't listen when the hospital recommended hospice. But if I could do it all over again, I know what I would do. Look, we can explore a lot of different options on how to do this transition. I think maybe you were right, sweetheart. I've been fooling myself. No one is helping us on this one. Good job, Michele. Well- I- Mom. Hey, I didn't mean to- I'm sorry. [Jan] So if you get stationed somewhere, where do you want to go? I haven't really given it that much thought. I don't get much say in it as well. But if you could decide, where would you want to go? Somewhere really cold. What? Why? I don't know. You know, everyone wants to go to Hawaii or the Caribbean or somewhere like that. You know, too many people want to go there. It's not special anymore. So where do you want to go then? Like, Alaska? Do I have to go alone? Maybe. Oh if I have to go alone, that's another story. If I get to take someone with me, I'm sticking with Alaska. You know we can stay in, get a big fireplace, be cozy together. Go look out the window at night, stare at the frozen ice. And just be warm in that little house. And no one to bother us. Why? Do you want to go to Hawaii? I'd look cuter in a bathing suit than a parka. You'd look cute in anything. I have to go. Okay. Close your eyes. Why? So I could break the spell. You're just gonna run off without saying goodbye? -Bye. -Bye. [Jan] He's taking one night class, so technically I'm not lying. You don't see the way that he looks at him. It's like he hates him. [Pastor Robert] But you love him. I ... Well, we've only been dating for six months. Why, did I say that I love him? You didn't have to. I just- I just want my father to see him. Not the way that he thinks he is, but the way that I see him. How long are you willing to wait for that to happen? For as long as it takes. Then it will. But you'll struggle, and you'll doubt it. Stay patient and eventually you'll get there. How do you know that? I don't. I just have faith that it will. Ehm- Mom? Someone's here to see you. [Pastor Robert]Well I guess I'll just go back to California then. Who told you? Your daughter. [Jan] Terri? No. [Michele] Don't give me too much credit, it was Terri's idea. I am sorry you travelled so far to be with us. Sorry I wasted your time. It's not a waste for me to be here. Is there any reason you chose to come in here? Just wanted to be alone, I guess. Oh, well, I'll leave you to it then. [sighs] No, sorry. Please stay. I got the feeling you're not spending much time in chapels these days. [Michele] No, I guess not. I'm not preaching to you, it's just an observation. But it is a bit funny though, you called me and you coming here. There are other places you could go to be alone. It's just a coincidence I suppose. Yeah, it is. You know, your mom's been talking with me since she was young. I saw you when you were just a little girl. I know you were raised in church. And I also know you seem to have a mind of your own, and that's a good thing. Yeah? Definitely. She does, too. Always did. You got that from her. But sometimes you get preached something so much it feels good to make your own decisions, and you should. I have. And it just feels safer to shut out what you can't control. But that makes for a cold world. And I think the world is warm, and full of love. If we just open ourselves up to it. Thanks. [Steve] Okay, well, thank you for another great meal, Mrs. Nichols. You're welcome. And I'll see you for a tutoring session at the library on Thursday. Sir? Yeah, eh, thanks for doing the dishes again Steve. I appreciate it. Pleasure. You know while you're still here I could use some help out in the garage. No, he can't. [Jim] I could use a pair of second, strong hands. Being in the military like I am, we tend to move around a lot, and basically I just throw everything in my truck and dump it in the garage. I could use some help sorting it out. [Marion] Jim. He's not your employee. I'm sure Steve has his own life to get back to. I'm sure he does, but two of us working together, get it done in less than an hour. Besides, I don't think Steve minds, do you Steve? Okay. Sure. Yeah, of course, no problem. Yeah. I'll meet you out there. Sure. Don't you have some homework to do? [Jim] My wife's the sentimental type. She likes to keep things. This is all the stuff she's kept over all our moves. Looks like we've been here for 30 years. Fact is, it's only been a couple. Yeah, I'd like to see the garage floor again. Far as I'm concerned, you can junk all of this. I'll get you some trash bags, you can put it all together, take it out front, and I'll haul it off to the dump in my truck. This is a lot of stuff. Well you're a strong boy. You got someplace you need to be? Uhm- I have an early morning class. Oh. Well, then you better get to it. Mr. Smartypants. You have roll call at 06:00. I know that. Just leave. You don't owe him anything. He's testing me. He's crazy, you don't have to put up with this. You're worth it. Please, go home. I'm not done yet. [Jim] Hey! You're not properly dressed young lady. And you, you better pick up the pace. Sun's gonna be up soon! You wanna help him? You put on some proper clothes. ♪ I know he's just trying to break me. So what, I should just take it? Whatever he throws at me? Yes. It'll be painful, you'll wanna scream at him. To stand up for yourself. But if you take it, eventually you will overcome. He's just trying to test you to make sure your intentions are pure. What do you think would happen if you lashed out at him? I'd be proving him right? Exactly. This might be the end for us. Today? Okay. Well we had a good run. I mean it. And why is this the end for us? I wanted to bring you here and get you a milkshake. Right. But it might come as a shock to you that I don't earn much money. No! It's true. You're probably expecting me to have you driven you around in limousines and draped in gold... Draped in gold? Yeah. But reality is- I'm kind of poor. And that's why this is the end of us? No. Here, uhm- hold that thought. This is why. Oh. I wouldn't blame you if you just walked. Right now. Well, you've given me a tempting out. I promise I won't judge you. So is this how it's always gonna be? Probably. Okay. I'm out. Okay. Are you sad? Devastated. How long will it take you to find another girl? Forever. Oh it won't take you that long to find another girl. There is no other girl. Well, maybe next time I can buy a milkshake and maybe someday I can buy us a lot more. What if I want to buy the milkshake? Are you afraid of me buying a milkshake? I want to take care of you. -I don't always need to be taken care of. How about- how about we take care of each other? Deal. [Steve] Okay, it's a six. But this is a Y, it's an N, close bracket, plus open bracket Y, plus three, equals what? Four. No, you actually wrote three. Negative four. It's a great try, but it's wrong. I don't think it's wrong. -It's wrong. -I don't think so. So here, ten questions right. [laughs] You got them. Steve. Great, you're here. Nice to see you, sir. I got a serious weed problem out in the garden, wanna give me a hand? [Steve] Weeds? [Jim] Out of control, like they do. Sure. Can I get some water? You're almost done, just push on through. Argh! I think these gloves have holes in them. It's the only ones we have. I- I- actually, there are some in the garage. No, I got rid of those. Aargh!! All right. That's gonna hurt a whole lot worse without them. What do I have to do? I don't know, what can you do? What is your problem with me? I don't know, I just don't trust you. Something not right about you. I don't even know what I've done. You don't think I see the way you two look at each other? And would that be so bad? Must be, or you two wouldn't keep telling me that you're just friends. I'm not one of your recruits. I knew what you were the moment I saw you. And what's that? Soft. [Marion] What's going on? Oh, nothing. Me and Steve were just joking around, huh? You okay? I can't believe him. I shouldn't of lost it at him like that. Pastor Roberts was right, I gave him exactly what he wanted. This isn't your fault. He knows something's up. We'll tell him eventually, when he comes around to it. I'm in the Air Police, he's a Chief Master Sargeant. We work on the same base, we're just lucky he hasn't seen me yet. But he's never here, he's always off on temp duty at some other base. He's got another trip coming up. We're fine. I don't know. Just cover for me on guard duty. [Robbie] I covered for you last time, the watch commander caught me. I spent hours, hours cleaning toilets. You know I can't pee in a public bathroom anymore? You know how long it takes to scrub a toilet with a toothbrush? You know how long it takes to scrub fifteen? Fifteen of them. Yeah. Because I did it when I covered for you with Julie. You mean my wife? You haven't proposed yet. Not yet, but I might do, maybe. Maybe not. She keeps me on my toes. And she's cute. Are you done yet? Maybe. Maybe not. You owe me. I don't owe you. I paid you back, we're square. Look, they haven't seen this guy in weeks. Or the- [Jim] At ease. Whoops. Your friend here- liar. Are you okay? I won't be soon. [Jim] Marion? Jan? Jan? You know that young man who comes into our house, eats our food, your friend. The one you insulted? Didn't think I knew about that, did you? I should've done worse considering the- student just waved me through the gate on base. Well? I wasn't lying. He is a student, he's just also in the Air Force. You don't think that was important for me to know? I knew that you wouldn't like it, and I like him, so I didn't tell you. You're dating a GI? I guess I am. Not anymore you're not. You can't stop me from seeing him. What? You don't think I can find a way to get him dishonourably discharged? I got a half a dozen officers on that base who would find a reason for me in a heartbeat. You wouldn't do that. Of course I would. No, he's a good man. He's a liar. He came in to my house and lied to my face night after night. I asked him to. Sweetheart, he's not good enough for you. Well shouldn't I get to decide that? This is for the best. No. No! That's it. It's done. ♪ I'll talk to him. Sweetheart. Steve, blink if you can hear me. Give us a little blink, dad. Please. ♪ Hey mom, I know you don't wanna move dad. Okay? But I do think we probably have some decisions to make though. What should we do? I talked to the staff here and they have an end-of-life physician, and maybe just tomorrow we go talk to him, figure out what our options are. [Terri] Can we just hold on a little longer? It's just to get information. Okay? That's all it is. I understand. [Dr. Russo] Your daughter has brought me up to speed on your situation, and obviously there's no problem leaving Steve right where he is. Our trauma centre staff can handle everything you need. Thank you. I have a question. Absolutely, that's what I'm here for. Everyone keeps telling me that there's no hope. Why? I am useless to you if I don't tell you the truth. The reason that everyone is telling you there's no hope is because there is none. Steve's lungs started to collapse before he arrived at the hospital. Along with that and the paralysis as one thing, there's just too many things to deal with. But people just don't die because they're paralysed. It's more than that. [Dr. Russo] You're right. In Steve's case, if he recoverd the ability to breath, on his own, or if his heart could beat without the extreme medical interventions he's currently on, then yes he would have some sort of opportunity for a functional life outside of the hospital as a quadriplegic. Okay. Some people in these situations have recovered. We researched it. I understand. But, if that were going to happen we would have seen some sign of it by now. Your accident was Friday morning? Mm-hmm. By Sunday evening Steve's heart still showed no ability to tolerate reduced drugs. His lungs clearly still showed no ability to work on their own. And since then, every test consistently shows that he's not only not improving, he's getting worse. Today is Tuesday, soon he won't be responsive in any way. I'm sure we can prolong his life artificially but would he want that? I can't answer that for you. You have to decide that together as a family. Do you think he knows? What? That's he's dying? [Jan] He was always the careful one, he was always careful. I am the one who should not be here. [Michele] Hey. Mom, hey, you cannot feel guilty for surviving. If I could trade places with him I would. ♪ [upbeat music] [Steve] Your dad's gonna go nuclear. That won't change if we go back now. Something's happened. What? They're transferring me. To where? Omaha, Nebraska. Nebraska? Why? I'll be part of the Elite Guard at Strategic Air Command. I'll be guarding generals. I'm proud of you. Thanks. But what does it mean for us? I might be gone for a long time. That's why I wanted to talk to you. Are you really gonna do this right now? How did you know? I'm not stupid, Steve. Well then, do you want to? No. But I'll be gone, don't you think we should? Why, I love you. Yes that's exactly why. You want to break up with me because I love you? Break up? [laughs] No, no, hey- I want to marry you. What? Before I get transferred. Don't people usually get a ring in these kind of situation? You know- I- I make like $250 a month, I can't afford what you deserve. That's okay, you'd probably pick the wrong one anyway, I can pick my own. I've been saving up from work. That's why I want to marry you, you know. Don't get used to it. What? What? My dad always said that if he caught me dating a GI he'd ship me off to Nebraska. [laughter] I want you to get my father's blessing. I know what he's been like, but he's still my dad. What if he doesn't give it to me? I don't see how we can be married if he doesn't. He'll always be my father. I don't want us to spend the rest of our lives sneaking around. So you won't marry me if he doesn't? It's important to me. Okay. I'll do whatever I have to do to get it. I love you. I love you too. [car honks horn] You think that's ... That's definitely him. Get over here, young lady. I'll deal with him, but you have to talk to him some time. You'd tell me if he murdered one of your ex-boyfriends, right? Right? Right? [Jim] Let's go. I will not forget this. [Jeep drives off] Chief? Liar who takes my daughter to make out in the middle of the night. [clears throat] There is something I want to ask you. Well I'm going to do a little target practice later on, we can talk then. Okay. [Jim] So tell me something Steve, you a shooter? [Steve] Yes sir. You any good? I'm okay. Have some pride son, come on let's go. This way. Shouldn't you lead the way? You're doing just fine, it's about 100 yards up here. We'll be good. Keep going? 50 yards. [gun shot] Good shot, chief. Nobody likes a suck-up Steve, your turn. [gun shot] You sure you qualified on the range? I did. You say so. Set me up a bottle, I'm going to move back here about 30 feet, challenge myself. [gun shot] Are you insane? Oh man calm down I could shoot a pimple off your face. [Steve] You're crazy. Don't be so touchy Steve, you're fine. Chief Nichols. What? I am here to ask for your blessing to marry your daughter. Oh. Is that right? Yes sir. Well I'll tell you what. You see that brown bottle back there, that's about 15 metres away. That's far less than you need to qualify on the range. I'm going to give you two shots. You hit one of them, you'll have my blessing to marry my daughter. You're on. Why do you want to marry her now anyway? What's the hurry? I'm being transferred. Is that right? Out of state? Yes, can you stop talking. Where to? Omaha. Can I shoot now? Yeah, sure. Go ahead. [gun shot] Steve, it's a lot easier to fall in love with a girl that you can see, but you're going to be on a new base and your air force buddies, they're going to be telling you that she's already forgotten about you and you're going to be sitting there waiting for your Dear John letter. It won't be like that for us. You're going to be out on leave, out in the world socializing. There's going to be all sorts of other women. Women that you can see and you can smell that are a lot more real than anything you can write down on a piece of paper or what's in a photograph. That's not true. You're still human, Steve. Everything you're about to do is to push you away from her. The only thing pushing me away from your daughter is you, Mr. Nichols. But guess what, I qualified as an expert marksman too. Go on. [exhales] [gun shot] Yeah well that was close. Go ahead and do me a favour son, let her down easy. ♪ If you're ready to leave- I need you to say goodbye. They think I should let you go, but it still feels wrong. I need you to tell me what to do. Please, please tell me what to do. Please. Okay. Okay. I love you. Your dad told me what he wants. How? We've been together 46 years. What did he say? He's ready to go. You think Pastor Roberts is still in town? Another half hour and I'd have been on my flight. I didn't think I would see you again. You're no more surprised than me. [sniffles] How does it happen? Without medication his heart rate will drop to critical levels, and he won't be able to breathe. Will he be in pain? No, he'll be sedated. He'll be comfortable. And then he'll pass peacefully when we turn off support. Is there a time you prefer? You- you want me to choose what time my husband dies? Yes. I'd suggest 11 a.m. It's between visiting hours and it'll be quiet. Can they stay with him? Absolutely. You can stay as long as you need. Heavenly Father, we come to you at a time of sadness, asking you for peace. Almighty God, we are here today because Steve is ready to depart this world and we ask you, oh Lord that you allow him to pass as he desired to live. Can I say something? Of course. Will you please tell him that he will always be- so loved- and remembered. [sobbing] Amen. [Pastor Roberts] And amen. ♪ [Steve] No that's it then. We're never getting married. You can try again, he'll warm up to you eventually. No he won't, okay you weren't there. You didn't see his face. And we don't have time for eventually. We- we just, we can't give up. He'll never accept me, okay you're right. It's not going to be any kind of life if we're sneaking around forever, Okay? That's your family. I'm not going to come between him and you. Well you shouldn't have to. You're not listening to me. Hey! I'm saying I won't. You're saying that this is over? It has to be. [knocking continues] Now we couldn't have discussed this in the morning? I'm sorry, I just didn't know where to go, and Steve's going to get transferred soon. It's alright. Love is patient and kind, it does not envy or boast. It is not arrogant or rude. It does not insist on its own way. It is not irritable and it never rejoices at wrongdoing. It rejoices with truth. With truth. [sniffles] That's Steve, he's taken everything my dad's thrown at him and he's done it with patience and kindness. Imagine that Steve did leave and never returned and you never got back together, imagine yourself two years from now. What do you see? Nothing. How does that make you feel to think about it? Like trying to imagine walking on the moon. Alright. Well? You know what you have to do. Now let me get some sleep, I still have to conduct morning services. But I don't know what to do, that's why I came here. I ... tell me what to do? You need to me say it for you? You obviously love him, if you want him, then go fight for him. [exhales] I love him. You're still a teenager, you think you love him. Once he's gone, you'll forget about him. I will never forget him. Jan, I've said my piece. You can't do this. Oh yeah? Try me! You can't do this. Dad, you can't... This conversation is over, young lady. It will never be over. He left me, he's gone. Because of you, you won. Does that make you happy? Does that bring you joy? I hope so, I hope so. I hope so because you did lose one thing. Do you know what that is? You lost me. I will never forgive you, I'm never going to forget this, ever. Well then there's no point in talking about this anymore, is there? We're done. You're just like him, you know. That why you're so scared? We were younger than they are when we got married. You think my friends didn't try to warn me about you? You think they didn't say exactly what you're saying about Steve? But I didn't judge you on what other people thought you might be. I judged you on your actions. He lied to us. Because he was afraid. You do know that they've been seeing each other behind our backs? You hear her. Creeping out, late at night. Is that how you want our future son-in-law to behave? What other choice did you give them? Well he's transferring. And if he wasn't serious about our daughter it would be a perfect opportunity for him to end it. It is. You remember when I was nine months pregnant with Jan and we thought I would go in to labour at any moment? You would do this all night. I have a meeting with General Robinson tomorrow. Your shoes are clean, honey, it's your conscience that isn't. You're right. I am. Yes you are. I need to make the choice for them. [sigh] What are you going to do? [Steve] What can I do? I don't have a choice. It's over. Might want to take a walk. What do you want? You'll address me as Chief, son. Okay, what do you want- Chief? I can have you written up for insubordination. Yes sir, if that's all sir. I have nothing to say to you. I just have one question for you. What's that? Why are you in the service? I am here to serve my country, sir. No, no. I want to know what it means to you. What does it mean to you to be in the military? [breaking voice] Everything. It hasn't just given my life purpose- it's given me a family. I've never seen anything like this happen, this bottle should have broke but it didn't. It got me thinking, maybe God is leaving this to me. Now, I didn't have to tell you about that, but I would have always known. And I'm a man of my word. So I think you're going to marry my daughter, unless you've changed your mind of course. Are you serious? Yes sir. Thank you. Hey, hey, hey show some dignity. You're still on duty. Sorry sir. As you were. Now it's my understanding that you don't have a lot of time to marry her before you transfer, is that right? Mm-hmm. Well then, we better get to it.
