That's like a historical drama. What do you want? On the rocks. Okay! Yesterday in Shibuya Tokyo during Halloween... A lot of young people with makeup came... It was very crowded and chaotic. The police department is in charge of traffic control. To hell with them! They're children huh? They're all happy and excited. They look like idiots. Right? Halloween is for celebrating the Autumn harvest. But in the west it is for dispelling evil spirits. But in Japan it is like a makeup party and celebration. Are you still open? Oh Samu-chan! Welcome! We're open! What's up with all of that? What? It's happy Halloween! Don't you know? Our heartbeat can't keep up with the beat~ So nervous! Welcome to the weekend! A hot summer carnival! Don't wake up from this summer dream! We're so sweaty! Excuse me! Excuse me! Can I use your lighter? Are you alone? Do you want to join us? Well...I'll just get in the way... You won't! Do you hate singing? If I hated it then I wouldn't come here. Let's go! For real! For real! Let's go together. I'll give you a drink. I'm not finished yet... Hey master can you get me another glass? Let's go. Just one song okay? No disguises... The answer is "No thank you." It's easy to drive on a familiar path. Say goodbye to tonight. Give us a kiss! This jumping heart... Is it because you want a kiss? I can't stop at all. Kiss me right now! Go away I miss you. I love you so much, I'm so happy. Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss me right now! Go away I miss you. I love you so much. Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! It's okay if we change the sky... There's nothing left. Let's take the ticket... We have a rose map... Give me some peace! I have been patient with you idiots for a while! I deeply apologize for this. I thought about calling the police... But thankfully I have your business card. Sorry... Hey...I'm sorry but please don't come back here... I understand. I'll give him a warning. Get your shit together aniki. Are you looking for something that's ideal? Hey...take me home... Dumbass, I'm going to Myanmar soon. Go back by yourself. They will go down! We still have you! Let's face this rotten world head on! We must rise up against them! We have Bushido. The code of the samurai. That is the spirit of the Japanese nation. Let's carry it forward! You also have this spirit in you! Eight months later Let's do karaoke! Karaoke! Wanna go to the ocean? The ocean! The ocean! The ocean huh? Let's go to the ocean! - That's good! - Let's do Karaoke! Let's go you guys! We're going to dig up buried gold pretty soon. All of you need to be careful not to have an accident. I just told you to be careful! Start working! Don't you feel like this job is a little bit sketch? Yeah. Do you think we're actually going to dig up gold? It won't be bad if I get about 70,000 yen a week for a little digging. I believed him at first. That old boss man. The only people who work here are stupid. What have you been looking at? Even prostitutes have the right to pick who they want. What the hell bro? Don't have a hard dick... Getting hard by yourself is pretty gross man! What are you guys doing? Hey! I can't work with them! What the hell? Do you know how the system works? 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. I see. It's only 20,000 yen. Ushiyama...have you ever had sex? But...it can't be here... No 12, Omachi, Setagaya-ku. Sanchome. Number 12. 12. 10. Haraso room number 205. I'll leave it to you. Don't worry Ushiyama. The woman is going to come in 30 minutes. Help out. Alright! Any time now. Ushiyama! Be direct and efficient! Okay... Coming! To be honest... It's not common for me to come to this area. I just had some free time today. 60 minutes is 20,000 yen. Can you pay that? Yes! Hold on... All those coins are a pain in the ass. You don't have any million yen bills? Million yen bills! Million yen bills. Geez! Calm down! Man! How old are you? You have parents don't you? They're gonna cry. Don't cry! I have to call the store. Hold on a second. Ushiyama! She's going to run away! How old do you think you are bitch? Stop it! Stop it! Don't run away you saggy titted bitch! Hey! Mizunuma Ushiyama is a spy from the police? No way... Don't get too heated. He's just a little suspicious. You're living with him aren't you? On a very windy day... He came to this city with a bag. Is there any proof that Ushiyama is a spy from the police? It seems like he's reading books that don't match up with his personality. Ushiyama is reading? That's right. I'll leave it up to you. I think that you can be the leader for this organization in the future. This is a trial for you. Investigate Ushiyama. Physics one This is foolish. This is quite the trial for me huh? Ushiyama. The underwear that you bought was good. That pair costs about 37,000 yen. But I want to make this clear. I can't pass this trial! We've come here to see you boss! Although this is a trial... This suspicion hurts our friendship! We can't endure this! Let's go. You guys are true members of the organization. Are you willing to pay the price in order to change the world? Yes! In order to change this shitty world... If we don't give you guys a difficult trial... Then you won't be able to do it! Sorry about that man. Once the boss starts speaking he won't listen to others. It's one of his bad habits. What a headache. But because of this... You guys can now formally enter the organization. Right? It's a blessing in disguise. I hate to say this but can you investigate it for me? Investigate what? Right now I'm looking after a really annoying woman. Her name is Silvia. I give her about 150,000 yen a month but I don't know where she is. She's a very fickle woman. She works in the night life but she promised she won't sleep with anyone else. But she's doing that isn't she? It's pretty bad. Can you help me see if she's lying? This is the funds. Use it however. Welcome! There's two of us. Then how about you sit there? Silvia-chan! Take care of those two over there please. Welcome! My name is Silvia. Please take care of me. Is this your first time here? Yeah... Is water okay for you? - On the rocks. - Okay. Sing a song. Don't do that. - Silvia-chan! - Yes? Please take the ice to Mother. Here are the ice cubes Mother. Oh, Silvia-chan! Let's sing a song! Ushiyama. Go home first without me. Here you go. Are you okay? Can you sleep with me? It's going to be 20,000 to 30,000 yen for a night. I'm heading out Mama. Thanks for waiting! Let's go? Can we go to the hotel that I always go to? What's wrong? Will you sleep with anyone? Will you sleep with anyone? Please... Sleep with this guy. No. Do it! No! Ukon. Did you go to Silvia's store? Yes. How did it go? Yes. What do you mean "Yes"? Silvia-san should still be following your agreement right? Yeah. Is that right? Sorry for asking you to do something weird. What's wrong? Dead...dead...dead... Dead...dead...they're dead... Ushiyama...don't tell me... What the hell is this? Ushiyama were you trying to fool me with this? Shit it's cold! Ushiyama! Thank goodness... Here! Listen up Ushiyama. Keep this a secret from everyone. Even I can't believe it... But the only thing that I can say is... He's alone just like us. If you are banished from this shitty society... What will happen? You should understand this right Ushiyama? Let me think about what to do with him for now. Hey! Hey! Stop! Stop! Hey you! Go home! Go Home! You are not human! You are a robot right? Outsideâ€¦outside! Danger! Dangerousâ€¦ Pay attention to suspicious behavior Damn it...I threw up all the sake and ramen... Huh? What the hell? What d'ya guys have here... Oh! I've seen this cosplay before! It's a Gundam...no...robo boy...what was it? I'm a little drunk... It's the robot that saved everyone from evil right? I'm going to be the one who needs help... I see. If we hide you then you're going to be exposed one day. If we just tell people it's cosplay and let him integrate a little bit into society... Hey. Are you going to keep wearing your mask? Take it off. Mizunuma-san... He is very shy with strangers... He can't show his face to people. Shut the hell up! Come on! Come on! You little shit... As long as he has the sincerity to join... We will not discriminate. Newcomer. What's your name? Are you going to tell me your name? Rob. Rob? Saibara Rob. Is he really a newcomer? Hey. It's you? What's up? I didn't want to come to this pig den but... But Mom asked me to see how you were doing. Stop with the bullshit. I'm not being a nuisance to anyone. He's one of us. Don't worry. You have so many friends Aniki...I envy you. Wanna drink? I'm not a fan of drinking anymore. Is that right? This is weird... Can't you have a more decent lifestyle? Again? I don't know why he stops moving all of the sudden. So? What about your company? What do you mean? Are you okay in this economic recession? It has nothing to do with you. Why not? Your older brother is worried about you... This is no good. I can't take anymore. What is that Aniki? He's Rob. Can I see him? I'm not dreaming am I? Explain this to me a little more. There's no explanation... This used to be a pharmaceutical factory but it became abandoned after the explosion... Ushiyama stayed here when he was homeless. What are you doing? I'm going to have him introduce himself. Can you do something like that? Alright, I put it in. His manufacturer logo is IAS. He's from the Princeton Institute of advanced studies!? The project leader is R. "Father" Neumann... It's driven by a quantum processor QPU. A Quantum processor!? What is that? No freakin way... Hey...what is that? This technology is made from the research of NASA and Google. But this is still super advanced. So what? Aniki...this isn't something small... The same goes for me. I can say farewell to my shitty and mundane salary-man job. Don't fuck around! Listen up. If you expose this to everyone then I'll fuckin kill you even if you're my brother! He's not a machine. He's a comrade to me and Ushiyama... Although there isn't a trace of gold yet... We must firmly believe the words that the chairman read in the ancient books. There's no doubt that it's here. Never be discouraged! Believe in it! Sounds good? Yes... No matter how hard you work you will only make 70,000 yen right? That's how it is. They don't have the budget. Why are you the only one making 100,000 yen? Damn it all...he did say he wouldn't discriminate against you... Well whatever...let's split it up. I-I can't... You really are spineless. You guys are making me look like the villain. Ushiyama! Should we use Rob's money to get some drinks with the ladies? But man... Rob stands out a little too much huh? Should we teach him how to fight? Welcome! What the heck? I thought you guys were robbers... No, we just like pro wrestling. Show me your face, show me your face. It's fine right? You're pretty handsome. And your friend makes a cute animal. He doesn't talk does he? He's a tough guy. He's cool! Ladies and gentlemen! The time for disco time has come! Don't sit down. Jump right up! Come on! Hey guy who doesn't speak. How about we dance? Are you ready? Come on! You guys too! Hey...what are you doing? Please stop it...what are you doing? Shut the hell up. Shut up. What's up with you bastard? Stop! For crying out loud... stop messing with them man. Sorry about that guys! Those guys are involved in a gang... you should leave now. Sorry about that. Let's go. Thank you so much. Thank you. What is it? Huh? Wanna fight bitch? Enough, already man. We ran away huh? Hey Ushiyama...how long are you going to wear that? Take it off. Sorry about that brother. When this guy gets heated he won't listen to me. Hey bro, hey bro. I hate the way you look at me. You too. How long are you gonna be screwing around for damn it! He's got the full costume on huh? I see...are you guys looking down on me? Quit with the bullshit! What? Watch out! Watch out! What the hell are you doing? Ushiyama! Hurry up and hide Rob! Hey! Who sent you here? Let me go! You're hurting me! Spit it out! Okay! Okay! Just let me go! That was Ushiyama-san wasn't it? How did you find this place? The brother of his parents contacted me at the Shinjuku station. So basically I was contacted by a man that looks a lot like Ushiyama-san. His parents were surprised too. So? Are you going to go back to your investigation office? It took a lot... From Shinjuku there's a stop near the station... The middle school students in this neighborhood told me... That a pitiful looking guy who doesn't really talk came into this factory. His hometown is in Kagawa prefecture. He graduated from high school and only 20 or so people are admitted to Todai university every year. It's a very rare school. Everyone is close like family. Maybe it's the pressure that causes them to vanish? Do you want to bring Ushiyama back to his hometown? About that... He's been missing for more than 10 years. Things have finally started to calm down over there... It would be bothersome if he showed up now. So basically my mission is just to tell them if it's Ushiyama-san or not. You don't need family. We can fly without them. Aniki. I didn't say anything to anyone. Really? If you said anything, I'd kill you even if you're my little brother. Well...hear me out. I don't have the freedom that you have. I'm a serious person who is a part of society at least. I have a reason to work and I know about A.I. systems. What are you trying to say? Aniki...do you know about robot verification? Robot verification? Has the robot used violence to harm anyone? Rob will only help me and Ushiyama escape. That's it. That's the robot verification. Listen up... The three of you... Raise funds for Kanashiro-san's activities... By digging for gold every weekend. Pretty much. You are digging holes for Kanashiro-san... But for that robot...Kanashiro-san's existence is meaningless. What are you trying to say? He's just digging holes. He doesn't know what he's searching for. Artificial intelligence will act as long as they are given a goal. But they don't understand why they are doing it. That's what you mean? We're just digging holes. To be honest it could be super easy to dig up buried gold. With such a high performance level, detecting buried gold would be no problem for him. You just need to give him the order to. Rob. We are looking for this substance. We did it! We did it! But...what are we going to do? Let me try to guess what you are thinking... You need to tell the chairman Kanashiro that you found gold. But you aren't willing to give others the buried gold that you worked hard to find. It's only the chairman Kanashiro. He took in a man like me. Our mission is to fulfill his dreams. I wonder? What did you say? A conservative anti-government person like Kanashiro... What exactly is your relationship to him? In simpler terms... If you can find a serious job in society, you'll be popular with women right? Is that why you're following Kanashiro-san? Isn't it? These are words only your brother can tell you. The biggest turning point in your life is calling out to you. You're not going to wanna miss it. There's no way out now. That's enough. I have an idea. Continue to dig gold like always. You guys aren't going to tell anyone about this. Sound good? What are you guys doing? Ushiyama...you're trembling too much! Learn from Rob. Hey... How many years has chairman Kanashiro taken you in? It's been almost two years. You think that there's no gold right? No...that's not true. Digging up holes with no results everyday must be a pain huh? It's fine. I'm skeptical as well. But that's not it... For me...the chairman is the most important thing. I would give my life for this man. There are people out there who are worthy of this. Is there a higher form of happiness out there? That's why I'm so happy. You also believe in the chairman as well. That's why I have trust in you. There has to be buried gold there. Be sure to dig it out. This is a fund for rebuilding society. Use the chairman's words to rescue the young people from this purgatory. That's the situation. Just work hard with us for now okay? How about it? Shall we go do some Karaoke? There is a beautiful Chinese hostess at the club. No... I'm okay right here. Then do we wanna get some sushi? Umm... Who was that person? Taeko? That's my daughter. She's a good for nothing. She was thrown out by her husband. So she came back here. When she was a teenager she fell in love with an artist. I can't really remember. She was frivolous. She didn't have any concept of chastity. In order to chase a celebrity she needed to keep it a secret from her parents. She even became his aid. She wore me out. I let her marry a man who was good natured but stupid. It lasted for 10 years. A lot has happened in these 10 years. Between me and her and him. They were still in their 20's. They were highschool students! The three of us ended up even staying at a love hotel together. His mother also came to my house to argue with me. Hey...let's go do some Karaoke. Are you okay? Call a taxi! Umm... Taeko-san! I think Mizunuma-san should sleep on a futon instead... Is he going to be okay if we don't change him into pajamas? It's fine. Just leave him alone. My Dad told you a lot didn't he? No...not really... He told you I'm a good for nothing woman. He didn't say that. There's no way you would understand anything about me. Or about women... Taeko-san... Taeko-san... Taeko-san...please give me a break... We can't do this here... But your dick is so hard. I owe a lot to Mizunuma-san... You're diligent huh? W-what is that? I'm thinking of ways to make this guy talk. What's up with his processing speed? Alright... Who are you? I'm DK80986. Who made you? I'm DK80986. It didn't work? It's going to need some more learning data. You're R-Rob... Sorry...I didn't understand what you said. You're R-Rob... Sorry...I didn't understand what you said. You're R-Rob... I want to give someone a present. A present? Yeah. What the hell? I wondered what you needed money for... Did you finally get a girlfriend? Is that bad? It's a bigger miracle than you finding gold. You work at a trading company. You have better experience at dealing with women than me. I see... If I want to make a woman happy... what present should I give her? Using material objects to seduce people doesn't seem like you. Shut up... Are you in deep with that woman? Rather than deep... It's still pretty superficial... What kind of woman is she? I don't know what others think of her but as for me... She's a woman who sends shivers down my spine... To be honest...she is the daughter of Mizunuma-san... Aniki...this love is pretty dangerous. What are you doing? Let me be clear with you Aniki... You should stop. What did you say? She's not a woman that you can get. It doesn't matter if she's beautiful or not... Basically...sex is that woman's weapon. She gets pleasure from draining the life out of men. If you have no purpose or self-knowledge then it's even worse. For example...it's like a dark swamp that you get trapped in and can't get out of. I won't say anything bad. You should look for someone a little bit better. I will introduce you to a good girl. All the girls that you've abandoned were known for being cute! Stop it... Damn you! What's wrong with cute girls? Don't blame the world for being unpopular! You're living in Tokyo like this... How could a woman be willing to approach you? You act like a tough guy to hide your lack of confidence. Stop staring at us! How are you going to transform society? This society is full of problems! Is there any other way than to try and survive in it? What's wrong with trying to fix the problems? I want to live properly! Go! Again! Too bad... Park Hills Tokyo Room number 806 10:00pm T.M? Taeko Mizunuma... I'm not really this frivolous. Taeko-san... I want to get married to you. I'll definitely make you happy. How? Just a little longer... Wait just a little longer for me. I want to be happy right now. Taeko-san... Taeko-san... The door to Hong Kong... Was opened that night. I contacted people from the Asian industry one by one. And then I heard a rumor. They said that people dug up gold 40 years ago. Was it here? I don't know that yet. Who did this? They said it was students from the left-wing radical school. Basically it was a very secretive group... And they packed a fishing boat from the southern end of Kyoto. They moved the buried gold to China. The Chinese mafia said that if a quarter of it was sold to them then they would start negotiations. It was a very ridiculous deal but... It seems like the group got 2.5 billion. That's in Japanese yen. One quarter is 2.5 billion... So that means that all of the gold was... 10 billion. Let me say this...we can find a lot more than that. Sorry but you guys stand out too much. It would be better if I went alone. What are we going to do after? We'll take a boat to Hong Kong. After we trade with the Chinese mafia we can try to convert it to yen. Here... It's a satellite telephone. Only my number is saved in there. If there is an emergency than use it to contact me. Will you be okay by yourself? I'll show you the power of the Japanese trading company workers. Listen up. You guys need to wait here patiently. Understood? Hello? It's m...e... Taeko-san... So...can you meet me right now? I can. Where are you calling from right now? My house. This is bad! If Mizunuma-san hears you... There's nobody home right now. He's meeting a woman somewhere right now isn't he? That's why...come to my house. Your house... Your Dad might come back... That makes it interesting doesn't it? Hey...is your dick hard right now? No...not really... Liar... Then how about I make it hard for you? Listen up. Taeko-san are you... Lick me... Please lick me... Please! Awesome! Amazing! More! Lick me... Oh no... I'm going to cum! Taeko-san... Lick me more! Dad? Dad? No umm...Mizunuma-san... I want to talk to you. It's something I can't tell you on the phone. I didn't think this would happen... I'm very sorry! Your daughter...Taeko-san... I was going to tell you someday... The chairman Kanashiro ended up killing someone... And it was a common person... No way... He used his sword skills to kill him... I won't follow this kind of thing. So where is the chairman? He won't be able to show his face anymore. For the sake of our organization, I became a demon too. Hey Ukon... You said that Ushiyama lives in a factory right? Yes... Is there a place where you can hide a body? Yeah... You bastard! How many times did the chairman save you? Now it's your turn to save the president! Right here is fine Rob. This is a very secret operation for our organization. The chairman is going to hide for a little while. Listen up... You can never open this up alright? Once the body is found... The newspapers will definitely make a report. Stop mining until it's time. Sound good? Always pay attention. Up next... We found an illegal fishing boat on the East China Sea. According to the Maritime security department... They have found two male bodies on board the boat. The heads of the bodies having fatal gunshot wounds. The boat was found going along the Hong Kong route. There is a possibility that they were smuggling. Sakon... It's been a week since that incident huh? How's it going? I have been paying close attention. Nothing bad has happened over here. Over here? What about the other side? No... I mean...I haven't seen a case for it yet. How is the chairman doing? He's doing a lot better. He's been talking about you a lot recently. He's talking about me? Ukon this...Ukon that... He always trusts you. "I have always believed in Ukon." He's always saying that. Hey Ukon...I have something to tell you. Okay... The chairman wants to dig up gold... And use the funds to educate young people but... He is indeed admirable. It's time to teach those who are under the mask of democracy. We might need to take arbitrary action. So basically... We might have to cause an uprising through terror. I want to hear your resolve. If it's for the sake of the chairman who took me in... I'll give up my life. Well said... This is the weapon. Use it at an important time. I'll give it to you. Come on! Squeeze stronger! Harder! I'm cumming! I'm cumming! I'm cumming! Hey... What were you and my Dad talking about the other day? Nothing really. What? My little brother... Huh? My little brother is dead. He died in the sea... Can you hug me Taeko-san? Stop doing that... Let's do a threesome next time. Kanashiro Ginjirou is inside of that suitcase. There's no signs of life. You... Could you confess to me? If you don't confess then I will have to kill you. This emotional protocol agreement did not get permission from Baza. This emotional protocol agreement did not get permission from Baza. The chairman acted like he was stupid! I asked him to give me some financial support... But he took out his sword and had a serious look... I had to kill him before he killed me! The double helix structure of D.N.A... Or maybe it's the Japanese way to protect themselves from the sun... For the peace of the human world... 55, 56, 57, 58, 59... Alright, that's three minutes. Ushiyama... Yes? When Sakon... What should we do when Sakon comes back with the money? Where should we go? What should we eat? Ushiyama... Yes? Will you be okay if I'm not around? You alone... In this current Japan... Welcome home! It's nothing... The three of us will always be together. Sound good? All of you be ready...understood? This is a very dangerous group. There may be a shooting order. Get ready for explosive attacks. Stay a certain distance away. Stay alert. This is a grenade... You take off this pin... And it will explode very easily. Let me show you how to use it. You wait about 3 seconds like this... And then you throw... What is that? Everyone inside listen up! Throw away your weapons and surrender! I have something to report. If you go outside... You guys will be arrested for murdering Kanashiro Ginjirou. The murder of the chairman? Kanashiro Ginjirou is inside of that suitcase. The person who murdered him is Mizunuma. The gun you just took is the weapon used to kill Kanashiro Ginjirou. No way... Everyone inside, listen up! Resistance is futile! Throw away your weapons right now! Put your hands on your head and walk forward! You're wrong! We didn't do anything... You're wrong! Listen to us! Please forgive me Baza. This is the best way. Nobody can protect you two anymore. I don't understand. This is something that was never inputted into me. What is compassion or sadness? Baza...I will perform the best solution. Aniki? Ushiyama-san? Rob-san? Complete Do your best! More! More! More! I see the head! Go for it! Go for it! Just a little more! Just a little more! Go for it! Go for it! Go for it! Go for it! It's coming out! It's coming out! It's a boy! Ushiyama... Your son was born! Ushiyama... I'm very touched... On the busy highway... Under the night bridge... When did it happen? When did you sing those songs? The depths of the sea are faintly glowing... It's lopsided... The long ago past... Directed by Nobuhiro Yamashita Thanks for watching! Like my facebook page at Rjgman56 japanese drama subs fanpage!
