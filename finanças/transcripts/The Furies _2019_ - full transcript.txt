Aah! No! Aah! What do you think? Hmm. I don't know. It's a bit prosaic. Oh. That means good, right? No. Well, screw you, Banksy. And you spelled "patriarchy" wrong. Wait. Really? No. Right, your turn. Show the world what's inside that super brain of yours. Oh, no. I'm just looking out. It's for your own good, Kayla. Kayla. What the hell? Maddie! What are you so scared of? What are youscared of? Me? Not a fucking thing. Then why is it such a big deal that I splash some paint on a wall? I just... I... I want you to have some fun. You know, the corner of your eye twitches when you're lying. Okay. Maybe I am scared. For you. Me? Why? I've been looking out for you since, what... fourth grade? Yeah. Ben Casey, you beat the crap out of him. Right. But I won't always be there. Sure, you will. Oh, get real, Kayla. You're going to uni. Yeah. So are you. - Oh, you lied. - I want to get out of here. See the world, experience something besides this. - I'll come with you. - Jesus, Kayla. I can't babysit you for the rest of my life. Oh. Wow. I didn't realize that my friendship was such a burden to you. It wouldn't be if you weren't so gutless. Well, I'd like to see you living with something like this. Here we go. "Boo-hoo, I have epilepsy." Poor, fragile Kayla. The world doesn't care. Either you start breaking some rules, or the rules are going to break you. Really? Be naughty? That's your life plan? No, thanks. I'd rather be a coward than a fucking loser. Fuck you, Kayla. Hey, Maddie. Wait! Just go home, Kayla! Hey, get off me! Maddie? Maddie? Kayla, run! Oh! Aah. Aah. Aah! Aah! Help me! Help me! Help me! Let me out! Help me! Maddie?! Maddie?! Where are you?! Oh, God. Somebody! Maddie?! Are you here?! - Aah! Aah! - Shh! Shh! Shh! Hey, hey! Hey! Shh! Shh! Shh. Quiet. Okay? Let's not announce we're awake to whoever put us here. Who are you? Alice. This is Sheena. We just have to get the hell out of here. Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Do you know? What's your name? Hey. Kayla. Kayla, do you have a phone? She's got nothing. Oh! Mm! They took everything. My pills... Kayla. Kayla. How long was I out for? A few minutes. What's the deal? Um, epilepsy. Well, that's bad. Well... it's not too bad, if I have my pills. Which you don't. Yeah. Fine. It's shit. Um, thanks for staying. Sometimes I... black out, hallucinate, but this was different. That's fascinating. Tell your therapist. Let's go. Sorry. Where's Sheena? She left when you did your thing. She said she was gonna look for help. So, wait! How do you know that that's the right way? Look, we don't have a map. We have no idea where we are. There is no right way. Well, then why not go that way? Because Sheena went this way. We should try and catch up with her, stick together. I'm going. Hey. Wait. What about you? Can you remember anything? Um... the last thing I remember, I was in a car park, about to jack a Commodore. I got jumped, woke up in a box. But before the box, do you remember being in a kind of operating room, strapped to a chair? They did something to my eyes. Mnh-mnh. Maddie. - Who? - My friend. She was with me. Maddie! - What are you doing?! - My friend. - Fuck your friend. - She's probably looking for me. Listen. Do your hear anyone yelling your name? She could be hurt. Or dead, Kayla. She could be dead. Or not even here. Don't freak out. If she was your friend, you'd look. No, I wouldn't. We need to get out and get help. So why did you stay with me? Have you ever been pigging? Pig shooting. It's our family time. Anyway, say there's two pigs. You set the dogs loose. Which one do they go for? I don't know. The biggest? The slowest. I think, in this situation, we're the pigs. So I'm the slow pig? What, you wouldn't outrun me if you could? So keep quiet. We won't have to find out. Look. It's another girl. Wait. Wait, wait, wait. Okay, okay. Shh, shh, shh, shh. Come on. Shit. Shit. No! Oh. Aah! No! No! Somebody help me! Oh, shit. Help me! Help me, please! Help me! Coward. Get up. Help me, please! Get up. Run! Run! He's coming! Please. Please don't! Shit. What's your name? Sally. Sally, it's not far now. Okay? No. Come on. Come on, Sally. Sally, get up. It's cold. Is it winter already? I don't want to die. That's okay. You're not going to. I'm a good person, you know? Why are they doing this? I don't know. Maybe we're being punished. You'll be safe in here. Okay? Do you believe in magic? In the Furies? Yep. Yep. Sure. The Goddess protect you. You stay hidden, okay? Just keep quiet. I'll find help. I will. I'll come back for you, okay? Please! No! What the fuck? Sally. Sally. Sally. Oh, God. Why? Shit. Shit. Aah! Oh, no. No! No, no, no. Don't! No, no. No. No, no, no, no. Please listen. No, no. You're gonna be all right. Please. Please. It... It was an accident! And... Help me! Sheena, help! She's dead. Please. Stay with me. Maddie. You had a fit. My cousin is epileptic. Who's Maddie? My friend. Sheena left. Do you know where she went? She was here. You killed Jackie. And then she was gone! Are you gonna kill me? No, no, no. Look, what... what hap... What happened, um... it... it was an accident. Uh... Please don't be scared. I'm not gonna hurt you. I'm not scared. Okay. I'm Rose. Kayla. I stayed. We're friends now. Yeah, of course we are. Is Maddie here? I don't know. I've been, um... seeing things when I'm, um... you know... having my seizures. They're... called hallucinations. No, no. This was different. I... I-I saw her. She was being hidden. Ha... Have you seen them? Them? The men, with the masks. Y-Yes. Yes, he had a bird face. Uh, let me think. Mm... An... An owl? I'm not sure. A barn owl? And then what happened? I ran. You should never trust someone if you can't see their real face. - Just because they post nice things and tell you... - Sorry. Rose, after you ran? Sheena found me. And we've been hiding. I thought we were friends. But friends don't leave. Rose. I won't leave you, but... but I have to find my other friend, Maddie. She's probably dead. No, she's not dead! We're going to die. No, there has to be a way out. Do you remember the operating room? I... I thought it was a dream. Did you have the same dream? You should look away. Why? Kayla? Kayla? What are you doing?! It's some sort of implant. They're in our eyes, our heads. I know you're watching us. Who are you talking to? The fuckers who put us here. No, please. Get down! You came back. What the hell? Is that her eye? It was her. Oh, my God. There's two more of them. They're hunting us. Yeah, no shit. Guys, we can't stay here. Well, do you have another plan? Besides whatever the hell that is? Maybe. What is that? The people that put us here, t-they've put these in our heads. I-I think that they're watching, - listening to us. - Because of that? And... And we... we can't get out of the forest. There's some kind of barrier. The siren. Rose and I remember a kind of operating room. Do you? Uh, sort of. I remember walking home from a friend's party, and some creeps... I was at home, by myself. Mother won't let me go to school. She thinks she's the best teacher. But why us? Because it's a fucked-up world full of fucked-up men. We're trapped. We'll hole up here until dark. Okay? There's no point running around in daylight. Oh, shit. Hide. Hide. Sheena! He's gone. Okay. Okay. He's gone, Rose. You okay? Okay? Why didn't he just kill her? It was like he was trying to see her face. What's so special about me? The coffins. The boxes that we were in. "Beauty 6" was on mine. And I saw some with "Beast" on them. Beauty and the Beast. Maybe they have to save one of us. That's crazy. No, look. I saw a... I don't know how to explain it. My... My seizures keep messing with these implants. Hallucinations. No. It's like I'm seeing through their eyes. And I saw one of them hiding my friend Maddie. And when Sally died, this pig-face guy's head exploded. A lot of women seem to die in front of you, Kayla. And one of them saved me in the field. They pair us up. And they cage us in. We die, they die. You killed Jackie, and then a Beast died? I think so. You didn't. Your head didn't explode. No. Why? There's nothing stopping you or Rose from killing me. Sheena, we just have to wait, like you said. Someone will come for us. There's no one coming for us. We're on our own. Look, look. I-I think that there's a way out. - Oh, yeah? Another one of your little visions? - No, okay? On the visitor board. What? On the other side of town. - It says that there's a gold mine. - Yeah? So I think that... that... that that's where Maddie is, okay? So? Come on. - You have to help me find her. - Yeah, right. Run around with you and end up like her. That was as accident. But we're easier to kill them than one of them? Right? Put it down. Now! It's a game. There's only one way out. Win. Run! Come on. I can't see him. Can you see Sheena? We need to stay away from Sheena. Okay? She's not on our side anymore. But why would she want to hurt us? Because it's easier to kill us than them. That's cheating. Look... I'm not like Sheena, okay? I won't kill you. And you won't kill me? Will you? No, I would never. We're friends. That's right. Okay. Come here. This... is us And there's a visitor board here, which should show us where the gold mine is. Oh... no. W-We should stay here. Hey, friends stick together, right? Yes. Well, Maddie's my friend. Don't you want to help me find her? Okay. We just have to keep out of sight. Okay. Did you see anyone? Let's go. Okay. Come on, Rose. Hurry up. Come on, Rose. I'm stuck. Just go back. Go back. Go on. St... Stop. What? Okay. If you scream... we're dead. No! No! Don't leave me! Okay. Remember, hide your face. Okay? Kayla! Come on then!! What's she doing? She's going for Maddie. No! You're not getting to Maddie. Aren't you about due for one of your little... episodes. Look... you can't make it on your own, okay? There are at least four of them still hunting us. One of them is my protector... My beast, right? Takes it to three. I do you... that's two. Rose... one. Sheena... please. Then your little friend in the mine. I should have... Should've what? You'd do anything to save your little friend, wouldn't you? You'd kill me. You'd kill Rose. Say it! Aren't you gonna save her? Yes. It's her! You are my Beast, aren't you? Where were you?! I called. You didn't help me! No, I did. Liar! Liar! Liar! Liar! Liar! Liar! Liar! Liar! You're safe. You're safe with me. I promise. What happened? There was a beast. So, he was Sheena's. That has to be it. That's where she is. Please be alive, Maddie. Close your eyes. Why? You know that they're watching and listening. Since we were kids, this is how Maddie and I shared secrets. Do you understand? You and me? And Maddie. Okay? Let's go. Come on! Come on, Maddie. Where are you? Maddie? Where are you?! Maddie! Maddie! It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's me. It's Kayla. What's happening, Kayla? Hey, it's okay, Maddie. It's all right. Come on. You're safe. - We're not safe! We're not... - Maddie, don't. Please, just... calm down, okay? I thought you must have been dead. I should have looked for you. Why didn't I look for you? Because you're not a real friend. You're a coward. Shut up, Rose! Maybe I am... a coward and a loser. Who cares, all right? What does that have to do with being friends? Tell her about the girls you killed. What? For her. Break the rules or be broken, right? Oh, Kayla. Where's this escape? Through the mine. What are you talking about? This is the mine. No. No! No, no, no. This is it. This is the only way. Th... There's another entrance. We can get past the barrier. - I-I'm sure that we can... - There's nothing there. This is it. What do we do, Maddie? What do we do? I-I don't know. No, no, no, Maddie. You have to help me! Maddie, you have to help me. - No! I-I-I don't know! - Kayla! Oh, God. No, there's three of us. We can... You had another fit. The Owl, the last one... He was Maddie's protector. I saved you. N... Maddie... No, Maddie, please. Don't leave me. What do we do now? "Now"?! Yeah. Is... Is the game over? Kayla? How are we gonna escape? There's no escape! Okay? They'll come for us, and they'll kill us... or worse. K-Kayla... Just leave us alone! But... But I saved you. And you promised to save me. I wanted to save her. I should've let you die! You said friends... stick together. Prepare winner for the next match. God damn it! Line secure. Proceed. Yeah. Well, these replays are bullshit. Recruiting for the new match is in progress. As a founding member, you are invited to... Who's there? ...the bonus program. Response required. I'm calling the cops right now. Really? Uh, no. I wasn't talking to you. There's someone in my house. Member TCM, you are in breach of protocol. Any subsequent breach will require compulsory participation. Who gave you this? What? Who gave you this? Derek... this club that you're a member of... I got no idea what the hell you're talking about. I want names. Fucking let me go! or I'll... Or you'll what? You'll kill us? No, that's impossible. No, only Rose survived that game. And yet, here I am. Wait, wait. This... This is mistake. Listen, I had nothing to do with what happened to you. You own this company. Yeah, I own a lot of companies. Then you should be careful who you do business with. I-I tried to cancel my membership. But you can't. Once you're in... You really should have tried harder. I want names! Mike, okay. It's just Mike. Mike! M-Mike Fallon. He's in my phone. He's the only other member I know, but he knows everyone... All the other founding members. Do I believe him? Who the hell are you talking to? Listen to me, all right? I have money. It's in my safe. You can get away. No, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, you don't have to this. Okay, you don't have to this. You don't have to kill me. All right? I won't tell them you're still alive. Oh, they'll find out soon enough. No! No! No!
