(brooding jazz music) (cat mewing) (cats screeching) (car rumbling) - [Eddie] Oi! Look! (wood cracking) (Eddie screaming) (wood clattering) Are you alright? - [Winston] Fine. - [Eddie] I'm Eddie. (brooding jazz music) (crickets twittering) - Mac! Mac! Mac, I got my GCEs! I'm gonna be a draftsman. (man sobbing) (knuckles rapping) Hey! (knuckles rapping) - [Man] I don't hit people. I've never hit anyone. (sobs) - You're all redundant. - But I'm engaged! - I'm terribly sorry. - Look. - Stay, stay where you are! Now, just back away. Walk to the door. Slowly. Excuse me a minute, will you? (knife clatters) (clock ticking) - [Eddie] I'm in trouble, doll. - [Anne] Don't call me doll, Eddie. - Oh, it's big trouble, kid. - Don't call me doll, Eddie. - Oh, it's big trouble, kid. - Oh God, here we go again. Oh God, here we go again. What kind of big trouble, Eddie? What kind of big trouble, Eddie? - [Eddie] That's alright, you laughing. - [Anne] I'm not laughing. Alright, what's it all about? - [Eddie] I can't say. - [Anne] Are you joking or what? - Well, how could I joke about something like this? - Okay, Eddie, what do you want me to do? - Marry me. (Anne gasps) (Eddie chuckles) - Now, look, I'm gonna give this to you nice and simple so there'll be no misunderstandings. Marriage is a highly undesirable state for me to find myself in, in fact, for anybody to find themselves in. But for the benefit of the romantics in the audience, I'm gonna put it down in black and white so we can clarify any doubts you have on the subject. Now, at the moment, Eddie, there are more than 5 million people unemployed, and you're one of them. And quite frankly, Eddie, your job prospects look pretty grim. - Yeah, but I got- - Let me finish! No jobs. Now, 'cause of this state of affairs, and the nature of our society, that dictates that we work to earn money, earn money for food, then you and many like you are now faced with the very real possibility that you'll soon be unable to eat. No money. Now, if these were normal times, I might be able to keep both of us on my earnings, but the way things are, there's more than an even chance I'll be joining you in the cataleptic state they call unemployment. In other words, Eddie, we don't stand a chance, so there's no point even considering it. - Oh, well, what is the point then? - [Anne] Dear Eddie, I cannot marry you. This is goodbye, Anne. (brooding jazz music) - [Eddie] The big kiss-off. I loved her, Aunt May. (kids shouting) - Well, that's nice. Have you got a job? - No. But I got her a ring. I went out with her for two years. - [Man In Red] Yeah? - I've cohabited with her. It was love. - Love? Love is like trash in the mouth. - [Eddie] What're you doing? - Bailiffs are coming. - But I love her. What can I do? - Try the back window. (radio stuttering) - [News Reader] Work will begin later this month. The government's controversial Employment Protection Bill becomes law at midnight tonight, making unofficial strikes illegal. The new law is expected to be challenged this week by the Ford workers, who are considering industrial action over proposed redundancies. A government spokesman said the strike organizers faced court action if they sought a conflict. - Coming off the fence? - That's my business. You ready? (machinery whirring) - I'm sure we regret... - Uh huh, so the fixers are back. This smacks of a sell-out me. - I'm convinced the majority of our members will act in a responsible manner. - So, you're going to beat the dog until he sits up and begs, eh? - [Union Official] Matey, the law's the law, whether you like it or not. - When was the last time you dirtied your hands? - Now, listen to me, you. You're getting onto dangerous ground. This government is close to declaring a state of emergency, and we're not going to let a bunch of fucking cowboys give them the excuse to kill our union. Now, let me pass. (machinery whirring) - Hmm, makes you wonder who the Indians are. (tense music) (horn honking) (car rumbling) Where the fuck have you been? Of all the times to keep us waiting! (vehicles rumbling) Some brother. Doesn't want to know. (car rumbling) Can't even ask. Can't even say, "Hey, Mac, what's happening?" - It was on the radio. - You could care! - He cares. - You know what's gonna happen? - Yeah, I know. - How can you know? - 'Cause you told me. (Mac's teeth squeaking) - Look, pull over. I'll breathe better on a bus. (tires screeching) No one walks all over us, understand? (car rumbling) (dog barking) (brooding jazz music) - Anne? Anne! (tires screeching) (body thudding) - Nobody teach you the green cross code? - Don't I know you? - Someone call the police. - No police, he's alright. Show them you're alright. - Don't I know you? I live in Florence Point, 156. - Everyone's gotta live somewhere. - You got a bird? - Everyone has, man. - I haven't. She sent me a letter. - Postman's knock. - The big kiss-off. - [Winston] Love. - [Eddie] I believe it happens. - [Winston] Believe in something, and they put you in a bucket. I had a mouse once. My dad put it in a bucket. - [Eddie] Did he? Well, what happened? - [Winston] I told him I didn't want a life like his. (cat mewing) - Have to wash your mouth out? - I said the truth. - The truth? You wear a suit, work in the city. Just because you walk out with a nice white girl, don't you ever think that you're better than us. (brooding jazz music) (women quietly chattering) - Singapore sling, please. Two. - Jack. Call me Jack. Are you sporting? - Football. - Rugger? - Karate. - Really? Commendable. I was in the army. Two kinds of chap, don't you think? The sporting type and the clubby chap, drinks, loose living, that sort of thing. With us, it's a case of mind over body. With them, it's the other way round. The thing was, it was always the clubby chaps who went down with the disease. The pox. The clap. Syphilis, gonorrhea. Breeds fast in hot climates. - We're alright then. - Have you ever seen a diseased member? - Can't say I have. - I've seen men blown to bits and the like, but to see a man eaten up with the pox is a terrible sight. (brooding music) The marriage. - What about it? - [Jack] Maddie told me. - Look, I've been out of work for two months. - I want my daughter to live in the manner to which she is accustomed. (brooding jazz music) (glass squeaking) (car rumbling) (gravel crunching) - Come on, Mr. Jack. I've got your daughter. Come and get me. - I've been thinking, if I was more like you, I mean, got a car, the clubs, I bet she would have married me. I could have made her jealous. I could have got off with one of them birds at the bar. - Poison. - Well, it's not. It's all the same. Look, I need a break, Winst. - Don't say my name like that. - If you let me in... Give us a break, Winst. - What do you take me for? (gentle music) - I ain't being nosy but, well, it's obvious. I mean, the car, the money. (car rumbling) (brooding jazz music) (car rumbling) (tires screeching) (train clattering) (children faintly shouting) (birds twittering) (sirens wailing) (Eddie's mum coughing) - [Eddie's mum] Education's a precious thing. Someone will pick it up and read it. (upbeat music) (doorbell ringing) - Holiday. - [Eddie] So, where are we going? - [Winston] North. - [Eddie] Why? - [Winston] To drive south and fall into the ocean. - [Eddie] Well, that makes sense. - Here. (Eddie whistles) - Popcorn. Who's that? (Eddie laughs) (children laughing) When we've done our business, do you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna buy a little cottage down here for Anne. She loves the country. She took riding lessons at them stables in Romford. You ever had any riding lessons? I wanna stop. - [Winston] Why? - I wanna pair of sunglasses. It's got nothing here, look at it! - Sir, please. - Look, look, there's no bloody sunglasses - Please don't do that that - you know? - to my stuff. Look, look, you'll break them. - Look! - The lenses will be scratched - There's nothing here! Look, I'm sorry. I decided to stop for a pair of sunglasses, and there's nothing here! - What's the matter with those? That the first you've tried on and they're fine. Thank you, sir. Enjoy your day. (birds squawking) - I suppose it's easy. Just give me the nod. Well, what about the bags? We don't carry our own bags. (clock ticking) (shoes squeaking) (thunder rumbling) (thunder rumbling) I just met your dad. Um, brown Windsor soup. Poached salmon. (thunder rumbling) Saddle of venison. The courgettes, floret of cauliflower, French beans, and croquette potatoes. A melon sorbet, and a rack of English lamb. - I'll have the same. - Bottle of Chateauneuf-du-Pape, '61. (cutlery clinking) Cutlery and accoutrements. Soup spoon, fish knife, game knife, sorbet spoon, meat knife, cheese knife. Forks, fish, meat, game, dessert fork, dessert spoon. Salt, pepper, side plate, bread knife. Red wine glass, white wine glass. Butter dish. (thunder rumbling) My mum taught me. Etiquette and education. Well, even if you never have a penny, you never show yourself up. Here comes the brown Windsor. (Eddie sniffing) (soup sloshing) - [Ted] Dear Dom, well here we are in the Med getting our knees brown. Grub not too bad. Soon have this nonsense cleared up. See you in a couple of weeks. Love, Ted. How are you, boy? - I'm alright, Dad. She sent me a letter. The big kiss-off. My dad. (thunder rumbling) Well, he died on his way to a place called Suez. You heard of Suez, Winst? - [Winston] Yeah, I've heard of Suez, Eddie. - He fell off the boat he was on. (Eddie chuckles) Never saw a camel. - Hey, Eddie, Eddie. Let's go to the bar. (man laughs) - She said, "Do you wanna get me into trouble?" I says, "Yeah, what time do you finish, hey?" Anyway, we're going along on this bus, you see, and all of a sudden we have this head on collision with another bus. And there's people laying about all over the place, you see? And this policeman comes along, so I got off my bus and I said to him, I said, "Has the insurance man been yet?" He said "No." I said, "Well, can I lay down with the others, eh?" (laughs) Oh God! (bird hooting) - Listen, Winst, what's the matter? Look, I ain't scared. - [Winston] Scared of what? (brooding music) (vehicles rumbling) (tires screeching) (glass smashing) - Oi! (bats thudding) (men grunting) (dog barking) (glass smashing) (tires screeching) (tense music) (clock ticking) (clock dinging) (man snoring) (wind whooshing) (animal squeaking) (gravel crunching) (car rumbling) (birds twittering) (birds squawking) (guns clicking) (window knocking) - Okay, out. - I'd do what they say if I were you. - [Man In Helmet] Come on! Turn around. Hands on the roof. Spread those legs. Okay, piss off. City boys. (vehicles rumbling) (brooding jazz music) (car rumbling) - There are seven kinds of foolishness in this dangerous world. I'm trying to teach you how not to live them. - You know what I'm gonna do when I get out? Forget the women, I'm gonna play me some cool songs, and dance in the open air. (chuckles) Get me some books, Winston, and you'll be the first one I dance with. (dog barking) (church bell ringing) (vehicles rumbling) - [Radio Caller] I'm not being funny, Tone, but you have to understand my situation. I'm paying for people like that. When they go out on strike, we have to keep their families. It's disgusting. We should put our foot down, mate. Stop fucking- - [Tony] Thanks a lot for you call. Okay, we have Bob on line three. Hello, Bob. - [Bob] I'd like to give a message to my girlfriend. - [Tony] What's her name, Bob? - [Bob] Agnes. We had an argument, and now I've been evicted, and she don't know how to find me. - [Tony] (laughs) Hey, okay, Bob. If you just leave your address, we'll pass it on, okay? And next we have Dolores, on line one, I believe. That's a lovely name, Dolores. - She said you forgot the caps. (car rumbling) (car rumbling) (birds twittering) (car rumbling) - What way are you headed? - That way. - That's close enough. (car rumbling) - Listen, babe, you wanna be more careful. - [Beryl] What? - I said, "You wanna be more careful." - No kidding. - I mean, you obviously ain't worldly wise. We could be anyone. - [Beryl] I can spread my butter. - Says you. Where are you from? - The North. - What're you doing? - Going home. - Where you been? - London. - London? And what were you doing there? London, do you hear that, Winst? It's my kind of town, London. - Who do you think you are, Frank Sinatra? - No, it's, it's the capital of the world, London. You gotta be tough to survive, but it's got everything. For a start, you're never alone in London, 'cause it's a city. People stick together. - [Beryl] And work? - Oh, there's plenty of work. I was never short of it. - I didn't see any. - Well, that's 'cause London looks after her own. Anyway, my roots are there. Ain't that the truth, Winst? - [Winston] Sure. - And what do you want to be when you grow up, a cowboy? - No, I wanna be a man. Yeah, well, how many hotdogs do you sell in a month? (birds twittering) - Known him long? - [Winston] Don't have to. - What about you? - [Winston] That depends. (sirens wailing) - [Beryl] Well? - Well what? - [Beryl] Well, I'd like to know what you think I'm doing down here. - I can guess. - Go on then. - [Winston] No, I don't do that. I hate being wrong. - We've been organizing. - [Winston] Yeah, figures. - We won't let them walk all over us. (Winston chuckles) Is it so funny? - You remind me of someone. - If they close anything, we take it over. - Definitely remind me of someone. - So, what are you reckon? It's funny, you haven't asked me anything about myself. It's like that nowadays. - [Winston] Best way. - No, it isn't. - I have nightmares. - I think the future's definitely in mobile canteens. - See what I mean? (gentle music) (sheep bleating) - [Eddie] All this space. - [Beryl] What's the matter with it? - [Eddie] I'm just saying, all this space. - [Beryl] Yeah. (sheep bleating) (Eddie laughs) - [Man] Oi, come on, oi! Come on! (Eddie laughs) Oi! (Man whistling) Come on, oh, oi! (man whistling) Oi, oi, come on! Oi, (whistles) oi! (Eddie laughing) (sheep bleating) (man whistling) Oi, oi, come on! Go, come on! (man whistling) Oi, oi, come on, oi! Oi! (man whistling) (sheep bleating) (Eddie laughs) Oi, oi, come on, oi! (sheep bleating) (brooding jazz music) - You kidding? - I don't. (Eddie chuckles) (gun banging) (sheep bleating) (birds squawking) - [Beryl] Run, Eddie, run! Get in the car! Move! (car rumbling) - [Eddie] I've never seen a man die. (wind whooshing) - Don't you like White people? - It's a White world. - I get on with them. - That's you. - Some good, some bad, like us. - Whites ain't white anyway. They just think they're white. Next time you toss, you have a look at that spunk in your Black belly. That's white. So, I know they ain't white. Understand? Now, ask me how you're big brother's so clever. - Why don't you do what Dad tells you? - [Mac] Speak? - Get a really good job with him at Fords. - You're trying to ruin my sun and swim? Let me ask you something. Could they build Fords on that water? - If they wanted to. (birds twittering) - How long inside? - No, my brother. - And you? - He works at Fords now. - And you? - They can build Fords on water. - And you? (birds twittering) (Eddie laughing) Your dad, does he work at Fords as well? - You should stay with us. - Shut your mouth, Eddie. - No, I'd only spoil your fun. - Do you know about us? - More than you do. - What do you know? - I know that they haven't beaten me. (vehicles rumbling) - Well, where're you going? - You have a good night, right? - Come off it. Look, where're you going? - You're not coming. You got a new friend, ain't you? - Look, Winst, baby! What about my big break? You owe me a favor. - [Winston] Look, I'll pay you back in full. (car rumbling) (people chattering) (vehicles rumbling) - I can't take the risk. - Oh shit. (people chattering) (woman chuckling) (door creaking) (machine creaking) (machine thudding) (machine rumbling) (door creaking) (people chattering) But why? - I can't take the risk. It's not that sort of a risk, Eddie. Look, it's nothing personal. You're very nice. - But I think you're wonderful. - You don't even know me. - Well, does the dolphin know the ocean? - Well, what's that supposed to mean? - Oh, I don't know. - You don't, do you? Listen, if you come near to where I live, why don't you come and see me, eh? I'll write the address down for you. - What's it like, where you live? (wind howling) - [Beryl] One day they took away our livelihood. One day they took away our livelihood. (gentle music) They stole our future, like thieves, but they couldn't take away the people. They tried to keep us apart, but we won't let them. From where I come from, we won't let them. (upbeat music) - Oi! - What are you doing? - [Man] Hey, you! (glasses clinking) (car rumbling) - [Boy] Come on then, our Jude! It's nowt to do with you, man. What's it to do with you? Just sit there. Just fits our leg in! - [News Reader] At the last meeting last night, workers at Fords voted two to one in favor of strike action. Their decision will bring them into direct conflict with the new Employment Protection Act, which came into force earlier this week. Emergency talks are taking place between TUC leaders and government ministers. The Prime Minister said last night, "If they want to challenge the law of the land, "they must expect the consequences." (brooding music) What were those mysterious (car horn beeping) objects in the sky? That's what the inhabitants of... (bell dinging) - [News Reader] As the chances of a fixed solution to the Fords dispute now seem unlikely, the employment secretary said the unions are attempting. - George? - Okay, Grandad, give me the money, or I'll blow her fucking head off. (dogs barking) Come on, tough guy. You wanna be a gangster. Shall I kill her? Shall I pull the trigger? (woman gasps) (cash register dinging) (bell dinging) (alarm ringing) (car rumbling) - You could have told me! - (laughs) Did you see that bitch's face? That was fear, Eddie. Real emotion. - Well, we're gonna get caught! - Not me. - Look, that ain't the way to do it. That weren't professional. They saw our faces! Well, I thought you was a pro. (Winston chuckles) You're crazy! We're gonna have to hole up somewhere. - Oh yeah? You're so smart, where, Eddie? (gentle music) (door bell ringing) - [Beryl] What are you doing here? - [Eddie] Yeah, well you did invite me, didn't you? - This is Jim. - Beryl, where are they? - Sorry? - Yeah, where are they? - [Jim] What are they talking about? - She knows. You see, Beryl, he believed you. Didn't you, Eddie? You've been fooled, boy. - He took it wrong. - He took it wrong? She just wanted you to come round and lick a few stamps. - You still around? - Don't worry, it's coming. - What are you waiting for? - Bedtime. (tense music) I know the truth. If you saw it, you think you would be any different? None of you would have lasted as long as me. - I don't like the way you spoke to her. - What are you gonna do? - We are fighting for our lives. We don't need any cynical arrogant bastards like you around. - You look like a dead man to me. - [Beryl] See you then. - [Eddie] Yeah. (thunder rumbling) We could've stayed there. - [Winston] You think they're gonna get anywhere? - [Eddie] Well, at least she's doing something. - [Winston] She conned you. - [Eddie] They gotta start somewhere. Well, she's honest, isn't she? It's more than we are. Well, I wouldn't mind going back there. Hang on. I'm in love with her. - Get out. - Don't muck about. (gun clicking) - Out. - Alright. Alright. - I'm sick of you. Love? - I only said- - What is it, huh? - I dunno. - Tell me. Tell me. - Alright. It's belonging somewhere, yeah? I dunno. Oh, you're like all the rest. You just wanna take the piss out of me. - Do you love me? - Look, the gun, Winst. - Like I love my family? - If you like. (Eddie yells) - Loser, loser! (Winston grunting) (car rumbling) It's finished. - Who's fault's that then? - Open your eyes, Eddie. - Beryl's right. You blame everyone except yourself. - Fuck off! (car rumbling) (tense music) - [Officer] Just a routine check, sir. Where're you going? - [Winston] Home. - This is it, D-Day! (plane whooshing) (planes rumbling) - Florence Point. Well, you sure conned me, Winst. Thanks a lot. I don't want it. Let's go for a drink. (sirens wailing) Call me tomorrow. (car rumbling) (vehicle rumbling) (vehicle rumbling) (people chattering) (dial whirring) (phone beeping) Is that Mac? - [Mac] Who is this? - Who's that? - [Mac] Don't fuck around. - [Eddie] I'm a friend of Winston's. - [Mac] How do I know? - [Eddie] Well, they can build Fords on water. - Where is he? - [Eddie] I dunno. - When did you last see him? - A minute ago. - [Mac] Look, meet me the club, Tobago. What do you look like? (sirens wailing) - I'm White. (car rumbling) (sirens wailing) (tires screeching) (horn honking) (tires screeching) (tense music) - [Winston] Dear Mum, and Dad, and Mac. I really fell for it. It got me. But now it can't get me anymore. Right now, I wish I was like Mac. I'm not, and I'm sorry. - You shouldn't have drowned his mouse. - What do you want to do this thing for? This is our place. Me and you, alive, little brother. Look at me. All the things that happened to me, that's 'cause I was stupid! Now you, you have brains. Come on, give it me. Come on. - [Winston's Dad] This is your influence. You brought guns to this family. - [Mac] Anything that happens to us, blame Mac. - [Winston's Dad] He looked up to you. - [Mac] But he listened to you. - [Winston's Dad] And rightly so. - [Eddie] Look, leave it to Eddie. I know him. Hi, Winst. Some break. Well, you couldn't do it, could you? No, it's important, this. You couldn't do it 'cause I was with you. This'll be the second time I saved his life. (gun banging) (dog barking) You're crazy! You'll have every cop in London here! Alright. I'm going. - Do that, Eddie. - You loser. - [Winston] Go on, fuck off. Whitey. - [Eddie] Coon. - [Winston] Honky. - [Eddie] Nigger! - [Winston] Rarseclart! - [Eddie] Jungle bunny! - You two as well. Go home, fuck off. - You want to blow your brains out? Go on! Don't you dare talk to me like that! - [Winston] Why not? - Why not? I worked my life out on that line so you could have a future. - What future? - [Winston's Dad] There's worse off, you know that, much worse. - So? They can build Fords on water. - Don't you come this education with me. Not now. I'm not a fool. And it's too late at night. - Tell him. - What? - About the new laws. - We're going to stop them. Hear that? - I don't wanna be around. - You thought we were gonna let them walk all over us? We've been sold out before, but not this time. We're gonna beat the bastards. (brooding jazz music) We are going to win with or without you. We are going to win. (gun banging) (helicopter whirring) (gentle music) (water sloshing) (Winston gasping) (sirens wailing) (brooding jazz music) (vehicles rumbling) - [Eddie] Dear Winst, so here we are, up North. I've been thinking about going into banking, but Beryl says, "Lick the stamps, Eddie. "Just lick the stamps." (brooding jazz music)
