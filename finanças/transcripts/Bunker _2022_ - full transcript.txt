Tribulation is communal in war, Gray. You should know that. Ah, you bloody scobberlotcher. Lewis, hand me your nose rag. Gray, would you mind taking watch tonight? Ah sorry, chap. Terribly busy. -Doing what? -Not having watch. Here. Oh, just a little bit will take the edge off, huh? Just trying to help. Fuck. It gets easier. Fuck off. Men. If I see you've left your post to groom that damn mustache again, I'll shave it myself. Wouldn't be the first time my looks fetched me a reprimand. Isn't one of you on watch? Just finished, sir. Can't imagine the view from down here does us any good. -Off you go. -Yes, sir. Sorry, sir. Lieutenant Turner. At ease, Captain Hall. What business do you have here? I brought you a new medic. Compliments of Major General Allen. - Lieutenant. - Welcome, Private. Segura. sir. Try and take care of this one, will you? We're running low on spare. Well thank you, Captain. I'll have one of my men show you off. Actually, the Major General would very much appreciate a briefing on your situation over here. - The Major General? - Sir. Of course. If you'd follow me Captain, I'll bring you up to speed. Stay put. Play nice. Oi, boy scout. Come here. -How old are you? -Eighteen. Christ, we are fucked. They're down to sending us Buster Brown. Aye, don't he look like Buster Brown? You want a drink? Oh... Oh, what's the matter, need to ask your mum? Now. Ah, it's all right, mate. I've been told it gets easier. Oye, Gloomy Gus, you want a drink? Oy, what's with him? He know English? I don't drink. Dulls the intellect. Eh, quite high and mighty for a greaser. Don't mind him, he keeps to himself. Don't wet yourself just yet, mate. Shells are more common than rain these days. It's nothing to fret about, till they're... ...right above you. Right. But I'll tell you what ought to give you a fright... the ghouls of no man's land. The what? Countless trenches and tunnels been abandoned around here. Perfect homes for gutless deserters and poor bastards left for dead. Livin' in the dark, becomin' less human by the day. They dig deep and far in the dirt, like ants in the earth. Why, they could be under your very feet right now. And they've lived there for years, only coming out on nights like this to scavenge among the rotten remains of no man's land. If you listen close... you can hear their wretched cries as they feast on the flesh of the dead. Tearing through maggot-filled meat like rabid dogs. Bit of advice. Sleep with one eye open. They're not afraid to spread into the trenches, looking to fill their bellies with the tastiest meat of all... boys fresh off the boat. Hey. Our stalemate has lasted some time now. Both of our numbers and resources are strained to say the least. At this point, we're just waiting for the other to starve. From the looks of it that might not be that more. I would just say the morale vanish. Is that your inquiry, or of the Major General's? Lieutenant, you have nothing to worry about. We just wanted to make sure that the lines before the fire where they may have been weak. Thank you for your generosity, Captain. Give my best to the Major General. - Lieutenant? - Yes? I believe the Germans have retreated, sir. What? They've appeared to have abandoned their outpost, sir. It's empty. By what we can see from here it appears the krauts have fallen back. Fortune is smiling upon us with a bout of fog, providing us an opportunity to cross no man's land under cover. This is a window of opportunity we must seize now. You really think that they haven't fallen back? I say we hit 'em. We hit 'em with more artillery, just to be sure. If the outpost truly is unoccupied it would be in our best interest not to blow it all to hell before we claim it. Imagine that, an entire outpost taken single-handedly with no casualties. I reckon we'd all be recompensed handsomely. Thank you for your visit, Captain. My men will take it from here. But you ain't shaking this off now. Major General would love to hear about this. On me. I will lead the path across with Private Gray. Once we provide the signal, Hall and Lewis will follow. After their passage, Baker and Segura will guide Walker as he lays down the communication wire. Are we clear? -Sir. -Yes, sir. Saddle up. Hold still. Hold still. Just stay right behind me. We'll be on the other side in no time. Come on! Quiet him or else he'll get us killed! Kill him! Kill him! Silence him. Move. What the bloody hell was all that noise? Were you trying to give away our position? No, sir. Fortunately for you it seems there's no one here to have heard all your bloody racket. Otherwise, that'd be you howling out there. Men, let's go. It's a ghost town. -Lieutenant? -This can't be right. Where is their damn dugout? Lieutenant? They sealed it up from the outside. Why would they do that? Open it up. Don't go! My God! What in God's... -Get him down. -Sir? Seeing as how he's all that's left I'd say he's our best bet to knowing what in the hell happened here? We're not gonna get anything out of him. Look at him. Perhaps not. But we very well can't leave him like this. Can't we? Gonna have to agree, sir. Something doesn't feel right. He's dying. Tends to his wounds and see that he's sound enough for questioning. What happened down here? That's what I intend to find out. We should be leaving. How is he? He's barely breathing, sir. Get him topside. Fresh air will do him some good. Spending another minute in this kraut filth won't help anyone. Once we're above, signal our outpost that they're safe to move here. I want to begin occupying the area immediate... Incoming! Captain Hall, take... Dig! Dig! Help! Gas! Get back! Take him! Come on! Lewis, come on! It's here. - Come on! - Lewis! We have to go! Lewis! Lewis! Help! Help me with this! Help! Lewis! Don't leave me! Medic! Lewis, we've to go. You, Baker, come with me. Lewis. Take over Walker's duties on the radio and contact our outpost. -Baker? -Yes, sir. You will assist. Once Walker is mended, have the other yank see to it that the chemicals are covered. Put the Kraut to work as well. That ought to lift his spirits. You are dismissed. Baker? Yeah. Lewis. You alright? Fine, I guess. Where are you from? America, er, New York. Lovely. Lovely. I'm from Newcastle, England. Okay. Say, would you mind if I offered a word of prayer? I think it will help settle our nerves. Okay. Yeah, right. Thanks. Dear Lord, we thank thee for safely guiding us from harm's way and for Your bountiful mercy. Please watch over Private Gray, and our other fallen brethren, as they find their way back to Your loving embrace... Walker has our frequency in his jacket. This is a-- this is Private Lewis of the 11th Battalion. Any units on this channel? Finish up here and begin preparations to dig through to the trenches. -What of our outpost, sir? -What of it? They can at least send us help. I cannot call for aid without sacrificing our defenses. Our only means of escape is to dig. You, come with me. Let's have a gander at you. You don't have any papers. Do not take me for a fool. I know you understand me. Are you a deserter? Is that why you were left for the dead? Why we found you hanging by a wire and a nail? The way I see it, you owe a great debt to us. I would think it wise to cooperate. One who abandons his post is worth no more than the shit on my boot. I expect more of a man, even my enemy. It may mean nothing to you, but honor means a great deal to me. We may be down here for some time, maybe you'll learn something about it. Sir... I think you should see this. They ordered a strike on their own outpost...? Surely, they couldn't have known we'd be here, they sealed the bloody place up! In all my years... this is madness. This is Private Lewis of the 11th Battalion. Come in. You know the thing about chats is... ...it's the eggs that do you in. They lay their fucking eggs in your seams. You think they're gone, but then it starts all over again. And they spread without any goddamn remorse. Hello? Hello? Over. We hear you, Lewis. Oh, thank heavens. We've been trapped in a German dugout. We need immediate assistance. Hello? What's your exact location? Ah. Ah. Hey. Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Help! Help him! Aid kit. Go! - What happened to him? - I have no idea, sir. He just started cutting himself. Walker? Walker? -He's not responsive, sir. -I can see that. Christ. He did this to himself? Baker? You okay? What is this? It's a mass grave. Easier to pile the dead into one hole than to dig God knows how many. It takes some getting used to. Are you... used to it. My job is to keep people alive. I try to focus on that. What's on your mind? I was just... thinking about earlier. The man I killed. Look kid, I know you're right off the boat, but this is war. You'll have time to wax poetic about this if you make it back home, but compassion is lost in a conflict. It's you or them. You're full of shit. Is that right? And what the hell do you even know about it? Care to enlighten me? I just... it just shouldn't be so thoughtless. What? Did you think this was gonna be like summer camp? You could just whistle your way back home to a medal and a parade? This is survival. You may be able to twiddle your thumbs and pass as a hero, but I'll be lucky to get a headstone out of this. I shouldn't be hard on you. We've all been there. Besides, being stuck down here with a bunch of Tommies, I could use a Gringo on my side. This is Private Lewis. Come in. Hello? Come in? I spoke to someone on this channel. -Private Lewis. -Sir. I thought you could use some relieving. Thank you, sir, but I'll manage. I insist. How are you faring? Hold fast, Lewis. I need strong and honorable men by my side. If it were just me and the Yanks I'd bloody well lose it. Sir, I... Yes? I'm sorry I couldn't save Private Gray. Surely, you'd rather have him here in my stead. I don't... I don't belong here. None of us belongs here. But we are nonetheless called during an hour of need. And in this hour, I need you to see us out of here. Can I count on your courage? Good man. Take your rest. Walker. Walker, in God's name please stop! Walker! What's happening? Hey, Walker. Walker. Walker! I'm just walking past. Jesus Christ defend us. What's happening? Private Lewis, come in? Repeat, come in Private Lewis. This is Private Segura of the US 90th Infantry. Hello, Private Segura. I trust Private Lewis has briefed you on our situation. Yes, but we seemed to have been cut short. What are your coordinates? Yes. Our coordinates are 50.1972, 3.2198. It's a German bunker, just west of the woods at Bourlon Ridge. Confirming your location. We are situated-- across the river and... ...west. Repeat? It looks like the area is clear. We're safe to move. We'll get you out of there, just sit tight. Okay, okay. How long until you arrive? Hello? How many men are trapped with you? Now... now, there are four of us. And we have a prisoner. Prisoner? Yes, a German. What's his condition? Stable. Good. See to it that it stays that way. He's a priority. Why is that? I would consider your rank before questioning authority, Private. Roger that. -How are you doing, sir? -Splendid. I'm sorry about Walker. He was a good man. Shame what happened to him. -What did happen? -Clear enough. Walker suffered from severe shell shock. Sir, that wasn't-- Do you have a better explanation, Private? All we can do now is keep our wits about. We will not succumb to hysteria on my watch. Lieutenant? I spoke to a unit on the radio. -They're on their way to-- -I instructed Lewis to oversee communications! -Yes sir, but he wasn't at his post. -I'll not have you meddling with our transmission. You are not to engage in any dealings of communication unless under my direct supervision. With all due respect sir, I think that I-- I don't give a tinker's damn what you think. You're not here to think. You're here to follow my orders. Is that understood? -Yes, sir. -Right! Lieutenant? I don't feel quite myself. Could you relieve me? Better yet, bring that coward Kraut here. Have him do it. I can trust you with him, can I not? Of course, sir. I'm putting my faith in you, Private. Prove your mettle. That is quite the journal. It is important to document our thoughts. Our words will outlive us by a great deal. That's the idea. And who is this record for? Or is it to be found with your corpse? I don't intend on dying down here. This is for la raza. A record of honor and sacrifice for our people to claim. And what is your charge among your people? I taught medicine. I would assume educators would remain in the homeland instead of fighting. I felt compelled to do my part. For a country that would not do the same for you? May I? -What is your name? -Kurt. Well, Kurt, did your spirit not burn with patriotic passion to enlist in the struggle? I did not enlist, I was drafted. An orphanage is a rich source for potential soldiers. You were an orphan? I was. My upbringing was difficult to say the least. I also spent time in an orphanage. And were you chosen? I stopped waiting to be chosen. I chose to focus on my community. -Smoke? -No, sorry. I suppose the air is sour enough. Kurt, you saw what came out of Walker. That wasn't warfare. That wasn't human. There is something sick happening in here. Something corrupt. This happened before, didn't it. With the men that nailed you to that cross. Do you have any experience herding sheep, Private? Sheep have a habit of putting themselves in harm's way. They are unable to care for themselves without a shepherd. Men are very similar. You believe we're doing this to ourselves? In a way, you are. Maybe we should keep an eye out for the wolf in the herd. Perhaps. But the wolf in sheepskin pales before the devil in shepherd's robe. And what would a devil shepherd want from the herd? Dominion. Thirty. Uh, 15. How's your leg? It hurts. Thanks for asking. -How's your head? -Not bad. All things considered... You know, some time ago, we were passing through a village. For 15 miles, and all the way we kept passing supply wagons. At each one I thought, I could throw myself in front of it Get out of the war, but I couldn't. Now, I might have an excuse to go home. God knows I'm of no help here. Can't say I don't understand. I keep going over it in my head. I'd like to think I knew Walker rather well, but I didn't know he was capable of such behavior. And that thing. That horrible omen. -Omen? -What do you think it was? -I don't even know what I saw. -You mustn't deny it. "The Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils. -Lewis... -"Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared -with a hot iron." -I don't want to-- You must not harden your heart, brother. We cannot stand in unholy places. Will you still deny it? Jesus, Mary, Joseph. -All of them? -Sir, it is a sign. We have trusted too long in the flesh of man. We must nourish ourselves with the word of God. Did you notice anyone else in here prior to finding the rations like this? No, sir. Time truly is no longer a luxury. We must concentrate all efforts on getting out. And I'll have no more of this gospel talk. No amount of scripture or holy rite will have us any less fucked. Sir! I apologize. I've mistaken rashness for candor. I mustn't galvanize you against your will, but I need you with me Lewis. Quite frankly, the Yanks and the Kraut seem a little too chummy for my liking. And I do not want Segura on the radio again. God only knows what he's up to. Maybe he and the Kraut aren't too unfamiliar with each other... -You don't think... -I think our trust is best suited to remain between us. Hey. And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgement of that great day. Gas? You! There's no gas breach. What is your design here? -Sir? -Bollocks with the formality! Why are you tormenting us? Sir, I don't know what you're talking about. -You and the Kraut. -What? You lead us down here. You nursed him back to health. You're conspiring together, and I won't have it! Lieutenant Turner! I apologize. Must be the air down here. No one relieved you of your duty. Take him back to work. I gave you an order, Private Baker. Maybe he'd be more at ease if you put down your knife. Frightfully sorry? You're not well, sir. I have been tolerant of you out of respect for our alliance, but if you attempt to undermine me so help me god I will bury you in this hole. I believe you have posts to tend to. Yes, sir. Stick with me. As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent. Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me. Come in, 11th Battalion? Yes, this is Private Lewis. - Oh good. - We thought we'd lost you. Our unit has been held up in the skirmish, but we're fighting like hell to get you. How are you managing down there? I'm afraid I don't know how much longer we can carry on. Stay diligent, Private. It in times such as these that a soldier shows his true strength. I'm not a soldier. I cannot bear this any longer. Your strength is your conviction, and such a strength it is. The others are in great peril, Lewis. is unrelenting. They're being led astray. You must be the beacon of light, that guides them to salvation. You've felt it all your life. As if you were called by the Lord. Well, many are called, Lewis, but few are chosen. Segura? Everything all right? Yeah. Just getting a second wind. - Lewis? - Sir. -How are we getting on? -Steadfast sir. That's my boy. That's my boy. What are you doing, sir? Preparing our defenses. For what sir? Lewis. Who do you think will be waiting for us once we've breached the trench wall? We need to be prepared. I've a task for you. Gather all the weapons we have. Anything that can be used in defense. And don't let the Yanks catch you. Just as a precaution. Right away, sir. How are you holding up? Not sure, to be honest. -You? -Trying my best. Segura? Do you think we're really trapped down here? What do you mean? It doesn't feel like we're trapped, it feels like we're... imprisoned. Lewis says it's an omen. I'd take what he says with a grain of salt. So, I mean you don't... you don't think there's anything wrong? You don't feel it? I think the last thing we need to do is to scare ourselves. If we stay strong and keep our heads together, we can get through this. I don't know. Lewis and the lieutenant seem to be losing it. Maybe we're not far behind. We need each other. Otherwise, we're as good as dead. Lieutenant Turner would like to see us. I've called us all together in the spirit of brotherhood. May whatever tension there was between us be left in the past. I'll not have our alliance cankered with bitterness. Now, we've no food. We've no water. We can feel the air grow tighter with every breath, and a timely rescue is uncertain. But if this is to be an English position we will maintain order under my judgment, lest we descend into chaos. For the sake of the lives of the men in this room that is not to be tested. First order of business, place your weapons in the center of the room. You see that I've disarmed myself. We will not carry on until we can trust each other. Very good. Now, we've made great progress with the tunnel, and I know we are all eager to be free of this damn pit, but we must be prepared for the enemy awaiting us outside the bunker. Clearly, they've been one step ahead of us, but as fate would see it... We have a bargaining chip. I appreciate the two of you keeping an eye on him, but going forward he will be under my direct supervision at all times. Take a seat in the corner. If you've any concerns, rather than quibble amongst yourselves, I urge you to bring them to my attention. Being the highest ranking official here, any and all deviations from what I set forth will be regarded as the highest form of treason. Is that understood? Yes, sir. Good. I'm glad we've laid that matter to rest. You may return to your tasks. It's all a damn shame. All of it. What would you have me do, Lewis? I've done what I can to be fair to them. You're an admirable leader, sir. Thank you, Lewis. You're a fine man. There's no other man I'd rather have by my side. Whatever path lays before us, we shall stride it together. -How's it going? -Can't say for sure, but I think we're getting close to the trench walls. Really? We're not out of the woods yet, but we're getting there. Baker! Jesus! What happened? We're gonna die down here, aren't we? Segura! And then we wanna trust one another. The great sword was given to me. Stand down, Lewis. You have no authority down here. We answer to a higher power. Oh, Angel of Christ, my holy Guardian and Protector... Release me! Forgive me of all my sins and deliver me from the wiles of the enemy. - Lewis, it's okay. - Just calm down. Goddammit Lewis, please! That I may not anger my God by any sin. Pray for me, sinful and unworthy servant. Lewis, it's okay. I'm just going to put the pin back in. That thou mayest present me worthy of the kindness and mercy of the All-holy Trinity... Lewis! ...and the Mother of my Lord Jesus Christ, and of all the Saints... -Baker! -It's okay, Lewis. It's okay. Amen.

We need immediate assistance! Come in! I regret to inform you that all our resources are tied up. We won't get to you for some time. What? That is, unless you can guarantee the prisoner's safety upon rescue. Kurt? What does he have to do with this? - That information is classified - I'm afraid, need I remind you of your rank? Who the hell is this? There's no one coming for us, is there? So, who am I speaking with? You'll know soon enough. You son of a bitch! We need help! And why fend for them? You would be the first they throw to the fire. They would claim your sacrifices and deny you your achievements. Why stand for those who would keep you beneath the soles of their boots? I'm sure you've never felt more alone. But you are wanted, Segura. You have proven your worth. You are chosen. What? Give me the gun. You need to talk. What is this? Why do you assume I have any answers? Let's call it a gut feeling. What is this? There is no time for this. Kurt, please help us. It is the Angel of War. A dark guardian, lifeless and deathless. Damned and fallen. A devil in shepherd's robe. What does that make you? It needs a vessel. I am but its lamb. Its ward and it's dependent, cursed by its care. What's it doing to us? It can exist only in conflict, and as with conflict it exists only to consume. How do we stop it? It cannot be stopped. You... Ever since you Yanks entered my trench it's all gone to hell. All my men are dead. My men. Out of respect I've been patient with you, and look where that's gotten us. -Sir-- -I've tried to reason with you, but you've backed me against the wall. Look at you, colluding with the enemy. -Turner-- -Traitors. Lieutenant, please. We can't turn on each other now. We can get out of here together. As God is my witness, I will honor the lives of the men whose blood was shed under my care. Know that I have not fallen mad. I am merely bound by duty! This is where you make your stand? With the enemy? To be expected from the likes of you. Rot in hell. No. Let it be buried with me. Let... let this place be lost to history. - We're getting you out. - No. No. Leave me. And don't look back. Segura! I'm coming back for you. That would be the last thing you do. I killed the Lieutenant. Thank you, Baker. We're getting out of here. Segura... We're almost there. Keep going. I know it's hard. We gotta keep going. -Segura? -What? -I shouldn't be here. -I know, I know. No. No, I lied to enlist. I'm 16. My mom, she thinks I'm away working. You have to find her. You have to find her and tell her I'm sorry. Don't be, it's okay. I'm sorry. Baker? Baker? Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Easy now. You're alright. Oh, don't worry, bud. You're in good hands now. Jesus Christ, you two've been through it, haven't ya? - The stretcher. - Get him on the stretcher. Get him on. Thank you. I'll see you at home. You coming? No, there's one more. Hey soldier, you just rest easy now, you hear? You got a warm welcome waiting for you.
