Yes, Grace? - I'm about to leave for the night Mr. Allen, is there anything else you need? No, I'm fine. Thank you, that's fine. Good night. Everything all right Mr. Allen? Um, I'm... I'm sorry. I'm late for an appointment. If something happens to me, take this to the police. Good night Grace. Good night. What I would like to know is this: Did Orbik Tech, a billion dollar pharmaceutical giant use the work of this man, my client Dr. Cook, in the development of their drug Xanoxin. A drug which has netted the company 600 million in annual sales. Which is really what this case is all about. No. Excuse me? - Settle down! I found no evidence in my research to suggest that Orbik violated your client's patent in their development of Xanoxin. That's not what you told me. May I remind you that you are under oath. Yes, your honor. You came into my office and you... look at me! You came into my office and you examined Dr. Cooke's research, and you said that without his process, and I quote, "Xanoxin would be completely ineffective..." No! - "If it were not for the work of Dr. Cooke". I... I was mistaken. Mistaken? Upon closer examination of the evidence, I found that my initial conclusion was incorrect. You mean after Orbik paid you. Objection! - Sustained. How much was it? Maybe you could use it to buy yourself a conscience. Counsel, you are new to this courtroom so I'm gonna put that down as youthful enthusiasm and not contempt. But if you plan to have a long career as a lawyer, I would recommend you learn a little restraint. My apologies, your honor. No further questions. Mrs. Sarnowski, are you prepared to cross? The defense does not wish to cross-examine the witness at this time. Wanna tell me what happened in there? Why, because it didn't hurt bad enough the first time? They're tearing apart our entire case. Every witness, every piece of evidence. You're right. We should go back in there and tell Sarnowski we give up, I'm sure our clients won't mind. That is not what I meant. I know, I'm sorry. It's just... I finally get my first big case and I'm watching it fall apart right in front of my eyes. At least we still have James Allen. Yeah, the guy who didn't show up for your meeting last night. I'm sure he had a reason. Yeah, it was probably your pal Sarnowski up there. She probably sent him on a one-way cruise to Bali. No. He said he wants this out in the open, he wants to clear his conscience. How do you know all this? You had one meeting with him. He swore he has evidence to prove Orbik Tech stole Dr. Cook's research. I believe he's telling the truth, David. I hope you're right. He's all we've got left. Hello, this is James Allen at Smith and Young, please leave a message. Mr. Allen, it's Sophie Anderson calling again. It's very important that I speak with you. Please call me back as soon as possible. Hi. - Heard you had a bit of a setback today. Yeah... Waterloo was a setback, this was a complete disaster. If you want to replace me on the case I completely understand. Don't be ridiculous! You had to learn to swim with the sharks some time. Then Sarnowski's a good a place as any to start. She is incredible. She brings out the dead then charges four grand an hour for the privilege. Maybe we're on the wrong side. I don't know about that. I'd like to think that somewhere out there there's something money can't buy. I knew you were perfect for this case. You sound just like your father. You don't agree? Well, let's just say that your dad and I didn't always see eye to eye. - He was an idealist. - What about you? I'm a realist. If it was up to him, we'd probably still be in that little storefront down on Columbus where we first started. And if it were up to you, people wouldn't be able to afford our services. Well, I guess that's why he and I worked together so well all those years. And what about you Sophie? What about me, what? You know, this job is too brutal to go home to an empty house every night. When was the last time you talked to Eric? Yeah, I thought I got rid of those. You know, after your father died, I promised myself that I'd do my best to fill his shoes. You have Bruce, I couldn't ask for anything better. Then let me give you a little advice. Okay. You can do all the good in the world, but it doesn't mean anything if you do it alone. Advice taken counselor, now can we please drop the subject? Excuse me Mr. Harris, you have a visitor. Ooh! How about a drink later? - I can't. I've got to spend the night conjuring up a miracle for tomorrow. Well, we can conjure together over a drink! What do you say? Come on, the usual spot. Nine? You're a very persuasive man. You bet I am! I'm a lawyer. I hate that! What? - When Mr. Harris arranges a meeting and doesn't put it in the book. Who is he? - I have no idea. He's kind of hot though. I'm sure he's just a new client. Can I ask you something? Sure. Is it true what everyone's been saying? What's everyone saying Clarice? Um, about Mr. Harris planning to sell the firm. I hadn't heard that. Because I can't lose this job right now. I know. Look, if I were you I wouldn't worry. You know how rumors get started around here. Well, that's why I wanted to ask you. You're closer to Mr. Harris than anyone. Look, I promise you if he says anything I'll let you know. Okay? You should go home. Are you sure? Positive. Get some rest, both of you. Yes, I'm still at the office but I'm leaving soon. How was your meeting? Hello? Bruce? I'll give you anything you want. Just... Hello? Please! No! Bruce, is that you? Hi, you've reached Bruce Harris, please leave a message. Hi, it's me. I just got a strange call from your number. Please call me back and let me know you're all right. Thanks. Excuse me, did you see someone come in here? He's tall, grey hair, 60's... I'm afraid not. Anything I can get you? Um, I'll just have a sparkling water, thanks. One sparkling water, coming right up. Thank you. - You bet. Good night folks, see you again! Come on, come on. Hi, you've reached Bruce Harris, please leave a message. Can I get you another? - No, I'm okay. Let me get my card. I think I must have left my wallet at the office. Sorry. So this guy is your boss? He was my father's partner at our law firm. Well, sometimes people who work together play tricks on each other. Maybe some kind of power game or something? No, no. You don't know Bruce. Okay. Okay, it was just an idea Sophie. So you've got a picture? I could hand it around to the units in his area. Peter... Look, I called him at his house, he's not there. Well, it's only been what, a couple hours? Maybe he went some place, had some drinks... Sophie? Hi. What are you doing here? Um, it's Bruce. He's missing. Thanks. What do you mean missing? Um, we were supposed to meet for a drink but that was three hours ago. Okay, well maybe he got busy, something came up. This is more than that. Um... I got this weird phone call at the office. Weird how? Well the phone rang and his number came up, but when I answered it all I could was rustling, you know like it was in his pocket, and it sounded like, I don't know... Like he was running. And then I heard breathing and... it sounded like a gunshot. A gunshot? - Yeah, a gunshot. Are you sure it wasn't a truck backfiring, a television on too loud? I know it sounds like I'm overreacting. You? Never! Maybe I should just go out there and talk to Peter. No, okay, all right. Is there anyone that you can think of that might have a reason to hurt him? A case he lost, someone with a grudge... No, I mean he's practically retired. The last case he argued was a speeding ticket he got on the way to Palm Springs. Well, maybe he's got a girlfriend you don't know about, or a boyfriend he doesn't want you to find out about. Is there anyone new at the office? No, it's nothing like that. Wait, there was this one guy he met with today. Okay, you got a name? He didn't have an appointment, he sort of just showed up. Well officially in a missing persons case... No, I know they have to be missing for 24 hours. I used to live with a cop. - Must've been fun. Sometimes. Can you just do me a favor? Do this as a friend, not as a cop. All right, I'll do what I can as a friend. But in the meantime why don't you go home and get some sleep. I'm fine. You don't look fine. You always knew how to make me feel good. I'm just saying, you work too much. Eric, I didn't come here for one of your famous lectures on my work habits, okay? So what, I'm not allowed to care about you anymore? Could you just... please help me. I'll do what I can. We'll find him. Good night Sophie. Good night. So? - So what? Come on, it's been over a year since you've seen her. What was it like? Same old thing. Bruce, what is going on? You had me scared to death. Bruce? Hello Sophie. Who is this? Keep walking. Um... Touch that handle and Bruce Harris dies. Who are you? Who I am is not important. What is important is how much you care for your friend and what you're willing to do to keep him alive. How do I know you didn't just steal his phone and this is all just some sort of... Sophie please! Bruce? Don't let them! - Bruce! Now that we've got that out of the way... Don't you dare hurt him. You're not in a position to threaten me. What do you want? - First, some ground rules. Number one, no police. Right now you're wondering which building I'm in and if there'll be enough time for the cops to find me before I kill Bruce. Can I help you ma'am? Trust me, there isn't. Ma'am, is everything okay? Yes, everything's okay. I'm just trying to talk on my phone, is there a law against that? Or... No, sure isn't. Sorry to bother you. It's fine. Very well done. Now go to your car. You've got things to do. I'm not doing anything for you until I know he's safe. This is not a negotiation. Get in the car, now. Hello? Are you there? Did you really think I'd leave you Sophie? Now do exactly what I say and everything will be fine. Write this down. Okay, hold on. You're gonna have to move faster than that, Bruce's life depends on it. Okay, okay I'm ready. Zero zero six... Zero zero six... Seven six five... Seven six five... One nine seven six... One nine seven six. What is this? - You'll find out soon enough. Northeast corner, fourth and Mission, eleventh floor. You have 20 minutes. - No, no wait! What is this, what am I supposed to do? Hello? Okay, twenty minutes. Destination entered. Travel time, 19 minutes. Hello? You're in. Congratulations. How did you know that I... - That's not important. Do you still have the number I gave you? Yes. - Good. Now all you have to do is locate the file it belongs to. Wait, what? What file? Where am I supposed to look? That's your problem... and Mr. Harris' if you don't find it in 15 minutes. I can't talk right now. Sophie... - I'll call you back. You were right. I stopped by Bruce's house, there was nobody there. Is everything okay? Bingo. I have your file. Congratulations. These are the documents James Allen was going to give to me, aren't they? That's not really any of your concern. Who do you work for, Orbik Tech? There's an old payphone at the corner of Ashby and Sacramento, you have 20 minutes. I'm not going anywhere until you put Bruce on the phone. You are a lawyer Miss Anderson. You should know that the photos you've just taken are inadmissible in court. Now... drive. I'm here. Sorry? I'm here, what am I supposed to do with the file? I don't know what you're talking about. I'm not in the mood for this. Where is Bruce? Who's Bruce? Who is this? Who's this? Somebody pages me from this number. I didn't pa... No! No. No! What's wrong? They're watching me. What? We have to shut the blinds. Wait, what? Sophie what are you talking about? Who's watching? - The people who have Bruce. Okay, slow down. Who has Bruce? I don't know. They called, I could hear him in the background, he sounded scared. And when was this? Tonight, a couple hours ago. Right after I saw you. And you're just telling me this now. I thought I could take care of it by myself. Take care of what? This. I was supposed to meet a whistleblower named James Allen, he works for a patent company called Smith and Young. He said that he has evidence that would help me win a big case against Orbik Tech. Yeah, I read about that in the paper. What? I like to keep up with what you're doing. He didn't show up. Um, I've left him messages, called his office... He's completely disappeared. And what does this have to do with Bruce Harris? Whoever kidnapped him wanted the files that James Allen was gonna give to me. They said that if I didn't get the originals for them, they were gonna kill Bruce. Okay, so if this Allen guy didn't show up, then how do you have the original? Sophie, you didn't... You broke into their building? What was I supposed to do, just let him die? Okay, where's the original now? They set me up. They sent me to a street corner downtown and then stole it from the car. What? Are you out of your mind? Do you have any idea how dangerous this is? Where are you going? We're going downtown, we need help with this. No, no... They said no police or they're gonna kill him. They always say that. What if it's the truth this time? Okay... So what do you want me to do? I don't know. Nothing I guess. I've just been running around all night, I guess I just wanted to feel safe for a few minutes. You still have that? Yeah I was gonna get rid of it but it's such a good photo, so... Yeah it is. Yeah um, actually I scanned it onto this drive with about a hundred others ones of us if you wanna download it. Yeah, thanks. Would you like a coffee? That'd be great. Okay. Um, let's see. What have we got? We've got South American, African, Jamaican... This is Eric. Put her on the phone. Who is this? - Just do as your told. Who the hell do you think you're talking to? Eric Robinson. Born in Worcester, Massachusetts, August 11th, 1980. Joined the San Francisco police department in 2003, promoted to detective in 2007. Now that we have that out of the way, put your ex-fiancée on the telephone. Or her friend dies. I'm here. - I know where you are. The question is why. You were told no police. No he's not police, he's... he's just um... I'm afraid you don't fully understand the seriousness of the situation. Maybe this will help you. Sophie? God! Bruce! - Sophie! He's got a knife! Bruce! No! My finger! My finger! Now, leave Robinson's apartment and go to your car, and let's not waste any more time tonight. Mr. Harris has only nine fingers left. My God. Okay you know what? That's it. I'm going to bring you over to Peter's place. You'll be safe, they're never gonna find you, and I'm gonna go downtown. We're gonna get some help, we're gonna find Bruce, all right? Just give me like, 30 seconds. Okay, I'm ready. Sophie? No... Sophie! Sophie! That wasn't very bright. I left the apartment. Just please stop hurting him, just let him go! Well that's up to you isn't it Sophie? You have the file, what more do you want from me? We still have some unfinished business. Reach under your seat. The package in your hand must be delivered within 30 minutes. What is it? I wouldn't open it if I were you. You might not like what you find. 60 minutes Sophie, Bruce is counting on you. Honey, I don't like me working nights either, but look at the bright side. At least we get the freshest muffins first thing in the morning. I gotta go, I'll see you soon. Red flag this license number. Who is it? - Sophie. I wanna know where she is, and I want you to check the system, see if we got a James Allen. Check the missing persons, the morgue... Does it have to be this morning? I've been working all night. I'll owe you. Hi, you've reached Sophie Anderson, please leave a message and your name and number. You must be psychic. There's a missing persons report filed two days ago on a James Allen. He works for a... Smith and Young. Well now you're scaring me. I I need you to track this cell phone number for me. You got a warrant? - No. I don't got a warrant, this one's gotta be off the books. Who is it? Some guy who's been calling Sophie using that number. I need you to locate it. Well maybe she's got a new boyfriend. You're not turning into some kind of weird stalker, are you? Just map the calls, will you? See, I was hoping that the two of you would get back together but... not like this. Hello? Hello? Bruce? Bruce? You killed him? Why did you? - Sophie! Bruce? Are you all right? He wants you to open the package. What? Okay, okay. My God. You set me up! Why are you doing this to me? It's almost over, Sophie. I've done everything you wanted me to do. Just let him go! Not yet. Soon. Why are you making me run around in circles like this? What are you trying to do? They're tearing apart our entire case! I heard you had a bit of a setback today. Sophie... Are you still there? How do you know where I am? Counselor, do I need to remind you how important punctuality is in my courtroom? Your honor, I'm sure Miss Anderson is on her way if you could just give us a few more minutes. Your honor, if the court could please accept my apologies, I was unavoidable detained. Very well counselor, you may take a moment to compose yourself. Where the hell have you been? I had some running around to do. Did you find James Allen? Yeah. He's not going to be any help to us. Want some more bad news? Take a look at this. What is it? Some new evidence Sarnowski just entered. Are those the same clothes you wore yesterday? My God! Read the bottom. Because of the relationship between cellular matter, no transfection is required. They doctored it. What? This isn't the original version of the document. How do you know that? Because I've seen it before. How? If the prosecution is thoroughly relaxed, perhaps now we can proceed. Certainly, your honor. And again, we apologize for the delay. Miss Anderson. Regarding the new evidence presented by the prosecution, we feel there are certain issues with regards to the validity of the documentation vise a vie, certain irregularities... My God! - Sophie? My God. My God, no! Sophie! Your honor, a short recess please? Recess granted. 15 minutes. Sophie. Sophie! Sophie! What the hell is wrong with you? Nothing. Are you kidding me? You show up late and then you pull that stunt in there? Are you trying to get them to call a mistrial? No, no, don't let them do that. I don't think we have much choice. Ask for a continuance, stall, whatever you have to do. I just need a little more time. To do what? You saw those documents. Orbik has an answer for everything we throw at them. Ask for an early lunch. That'll give us at least 90 more minutes. And then what? Just trust me, David. Please. All right. I'll talk to the judge, I'll see what I can do. Thank you. You're welcome. I wanna talk to him. I'm afraid that's impossible right now. He's in a lot of pain, as you could imagine. Please, just stop. Well that is entirely up to you, isn't it? No it isn't! I've done everything you've told me to do. I didn't tell you to go to court. What difference does it make? You have the decks stacked, we can't... we can't win. Or can we? There's still a loose end somewhere, isn't there? Am I right? I said am I right? We're not finished yet. I'll be in touch. Thanks for taking the time to see me. I just have a few questions for you, it shouldn't take too long. I'm glad you came by. I told the officers who came in the other day how worried I was but... they didn't seem very concerned about it. As if people just disappear every day. When did you report him missing? I didn't. His wife did, two days ago. He didn't come home and she got worried so she called here and I told her he left and was probably on his way, but... well, he didn't show up. And what does Mr. Allen do here? Mostly the patent law. He oversees the paperwork for our biggest clients. Like Orbik Tech? We have many clients. Was he working on Xanoxin? I'm not supposed to discuss that sort of thing. And where's his computer? Um... I.T. took it away for maintenance. So your boss is missing and they just happen to take his computer in for repairs? Um... Is there anything else unusual that happened around here before he disappeared? There is one thing. I know Mr. Allen knew something was going to happen. How's that? The last time I saw him he gave me, you know those flash drives for your computer, and he told me that if anything were to happen to him, to give it to the police. And where is it now? Well, something happened. I gave it to the police. Excuse me. All right. Thank you. Sophie. What have you gotten yourself into? Peter, I need you to run a plate number for me. Eric listen, that guy you're looking for, James Allen? They found him in a motel room this morning. Good, I wanna talk to him. That's gonna be tricky. He's dead. Did somebody kill him? Not just somebody. They positive ID'd her on a security camera and they've got her driver's license. Now you better get ready for this. Who is it? Sophie. In the city's latest homicide, police were called to the Royal Inn Motel early this morning, to the investigate the discovery of a body. The victim, 32-year-old James Allen... Pardon me while I powder my nose. If you've come to offer a plea bargain, you're a little late. I want a name. Is this an interrogation, counselor? Perhaps I need a lawyer. Who's behind this? Behind what? You know it's clever, if you really think about it. Using me of all people to get rid of the evidence, that would've saved my case. I'm sure I have no idea what you're talking about. Tell me, what is the going rate for a soul these days? 500,000? 600,000? Ask yourself. You're the one with the behavior problems. Speaking of which, I hear we're now adding murder to your list of accolades. I didn't kill him. Well then I hope you have a great lawyer. Do you have any idea how much trouble you're in, counselor? Do you? A man is dead. And another one, who's the closest thing I have to family, is being tortured. So a little more trouble doesn't make a difference to me. Honey, I am a small cog in a very large wheel. You want answers, I suggest you go a little higher up the ladder. Here's what I can tell you, I love what I do and I am great at it. And I have always, without fail, represented my client's best interests, whether I agree with them or not. I'll give you 30 seconds before I call the police. Don't do me any favors. Robinson. I found her. Her license number just popped up. She got a parking ticket at Stockton and Sacramento two minutes ago. Sophie! Eric, what are you doing here? How did you find me? Come on, we gotta get you out of here. James Allen is dead. The police think you were there. I... I was. - What? It's all a part of it. I don't know what they want me to do but I... I can't stop until they let Bruce go. You need to go, you need to let me finish this. Sophie Anderson? No... You brought them? - No, I swear. They said no police! I didn't! Nobody knows I'm here. Guys, come on. She didn't do anything. Eric! Look, I'm a lawyer, I can explain everything. Guys! Cortez. Yeah, I need your help on something. So why'd you kill him? I told you, I didn't kill him. Why would I? The man was about to make my case. You had a meeting set. He missed it. Says here you rescheduled. I took the liberty of checking your calendar. You had an appointment with him the night he was killed. No, no, no that's impossible. We didn't reschedule, he didn't even get back to me. My computer must've been hacked. So this hacker also provided your driver's license and credit card to the hotel, for the room you rented in your name? My wallet was stolen from my office, okay? I haven't been able to find it since last night. Convenient. Your father left you substantial shares of the firm when he died, didn't he? Yes, but I don't see how that has anything to do... Anderson and Harris have been running in the red for a year now. The Orbik Tech case would fix it. Am I right? - It would help, yes. But... So, Mr. Allen comes forward, agrees to help you. Great, right? Here you're thinking he's gonna save your case, save the firm. Something goes wrong, you argue. Push comes to shove, things get out of control and bang! You shoot him. I don't even know how to use a gun! You lived with a cop for a year, you expect me to believe that? It's the truth. - Now with Allen out of the way, you've gotta clean up your mess. Break into his files, destroy any evidence of your involvement, and went to the hotel to clean up. But somebody tipped off the police before you could finish. Am I right? Because if you have another explanation for it, I would love to hear it. I can't tell you. You can't tell me? Or you won't? I'll let you think about that for a bit. Yes? You're doing an excellent job. You're watching this? Did you know that the city farms out their network security to the lowest bidder? We have access to every camera and every computer file in this nation. How did you even know I'd be here? You wanted me to get arrested, didn't you? There's a reason for everything. In this case, it's the evidence room. Guide number 4572. What? 10 minutes. I don't have a lot of time. I'm not allowed anywhere near your case. I have to get to the evidence room. What? That's why they set me up for Allen's murder. They wanted me to end up here. Sophie, this is out of control. A man is already dead. And another one is going to die if I don't stop it. You're gonna let us handle this, alright? We're gonna find Bruce. He said no police. Sophie, look around. You're already in a lot of trouble. I'm gonna go talk to the D.A., try and organize some kind of bail arrangement and get you outta here. Eric, there's no time. Please, just trust me. Let me handle it? Okay. You're right, I should let you handle it. Okay, look I'll be right back. Eric? Thank you. Yeah? I gotta do another DNA test on a weapon in there. Got a request slip? I must've left it upstairs. Thanks. You're new. Yeah, yeah I just got transferred here from Michigan. Thanks. So I talked to the chief and... Hey you. Yes? You forgot to write down what department you're in. Didn't I? No, you didn't. Well I'm in fraud. No you're not, I know everybody in fraud. Well like I said, I just transferred here. Actually, you know what? You just wait here, I'm gonna call upstairs. Give me your badge number? What's the hold up down here? Come on, you know we need that stuff right away, let's go. You know her detective? Yeah, you know the captain, always giving me the rookies. Yeah, well you got your work cut out for you here. What the hell are you up to? - This is what they wanted. Allen, James. Wait, wait, what are you doing? I wanna know what I'm throwing my career away for. Hurry. It's Dr. Cooke's original research for Orbik Tech. It's clinical studies, the trials, everything! This must've been what Allen's assistant was talking about. He gave it to her before he disappeared. But how'd your guy on the phone know where it was? He said they have access to the entire police department. The security cameras, the files, everything. Yes? I can't see you Sophie. That's not good for Mr. Harris's health. I have what you wanted, I found the flash drive. I'm impressed. Bring it to the presidio. The west maintenance building, should take you 30 minutes. Or Bruce dies. - That's impossible! For Mr. Harris's sake, I hope not. And Sophie, come alone. It's copy protected, I can't save it to the hard drive. You hand this over to them, you've got nothing. Except Bruce. You know, they're gonna find out you're missing. We've gotta get you out of here. How? What are those for? Trust me. And give me my badge back. Almost there. How the hell did she get out? Okay... - Hey! Detective! Detective Robinson! My truck's out back. If they catch us they'll throw you off the force, or worse. I've already had worse. Living without you. Why did we break up again? You said our relationship wasn't exciting enough. Where are we going? - Just uncuff me first. Hurry! What are you doing? I can't let you do this. Just go back in there, tell them I made you help me. Sophie, unlock this door. I love you. Sophie! What? - Where are you? Johnson is screaming for your head, she says you took Sophie. No, not exactly. Well, where is she? Look, I don't know. She took the car and... Okay, the phone calls, the ones going to Sophie's cell phone... Did you find out where they're coming from? Yeah, I ran a triangulation twice but it doesn't make any sense. Where Peter? According to this the calls are coming from the middle of the presidio. You made it Sophie. Now walk away from your vehicle. You're a very brave young lady. Let's just get this over with. There's a path to your left, follow it. You have something for me? Show me Bruce first. You're a brave lady. Show me Bruce, or I'll walk and give this thing to CNN. You've looked at it. Enough to know that you're with Orbik Tech. This is all quite a bit bigger than Orbik Tech. Then who is it? I don't think having that information would help you sleep at night. Where is he? Bring him to the door. Sophie! - Bruce! Now. Thank you. Maybe we can work together again some time. Bruce! Sophie! Are you all right? He was right here, I just saw him. Bruce? Sophie! They're getting away. Here. I'm gonna call it in, get some back up. Somebody's been in the car. Why did you do that? Insurance. The flash drive? Don't worry about it. Let's go. Bruce, it's over. Let's go. The cause of yesterday's explosion is still unclear. But the vehicle involved has been identified as belonging to detective Eric Robinson, who police believe allegedly helped a suspect in the recent murder of lawyer James Allen to escape custody. Sophie Anderson was a person of interest in that case and while no connection has been established between the two, the investigation continues. Please everyone. Could I have your attention please? This has been a harrowing experience for all of us and I won't lie to you, it's been very difficult personally. Not the least because I, I considered Sophie... well, she was like a daughter to me. And as someone who's been very close to her and her family, I feel it would be prudent for us to show a little restraint and wait for the police press conference later this evening. There's another matter I would like to discuss with you. And that is... the future of this firm. Now I've heard a lot of rumors about financial difficulties and bankruptcies and mergers et cetera. But I think you deserve to have someone set the record straight. Now, the truth is, this firm has had some hard times of late. Perhaps we haven't adapted to the changing times as well as we could have. So... the board and I, this morning... We finalized a deal for a takeover from Sloane Halligan. Ever since I founded this firm with Marty Anderson so many years ago, I have poured my heart and my soul... My sweat and tears into each and every case that we have fought. And into, into every client we've ever had the privilege to represent. And If any of you have any questions, I'll be happy to address them privately later on. Thank you. So... what is a finger worth these days? 30 million? Sophie... my God. Sophie, you're alive! I can't believe this, I'm so happy to see you. Are you really? Well of course! If it wasn't for you, they would've killed me! I don't, I don't think so. I don't understand what you mean. I heard your little speech out there. It was very impressive. Very heart felt. How much to you stand to make on the merger anyway? Nothing. I'll have less than when I started the firm. Well I guess it's good that you have your compensation from Orbik Tech coming? Sophie... I don't know what you mean. Come on Bruce. Let's just stop this. It was you on the phone, wasn't it? This is not a negotiation. Get in the car. You've been watching me this whole time. You tipped Orbik Tech off about their whistleblower, and then framed me for the murder. I had to clean up the mess. You tried to have me killed. No, no, no. That was not my idea. I was promised that no harm would come to you. I guess that's why they rigged the car to explode with enough time for us to run. It was very thoughtful. Get out of the car! Very sloppy. How could you do this Bruce? I loved you like a father. And when I thought that they were hurting you... I mean, my God, you cut off your own finger. That was their idea. They thought you needed proof. A fingerprint, a blood sample... But you just let them do it? It's... a great deal of money. Look, the firm was dying. Everything your father and I worked for was about to be destroyed. Don't you dare bring him into this. This doesn't have to end this way. I... I can cut you in. These people, they have billions of dollars. We can make the charges go away. You'll never have to work again as long as you live! What about everyone else? All those people who trusted you to take care of them! You are still wanted for murder. The flash drive, the only hope you have of winning this case, is gone! Take the deal! Not today. That's it. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say or do can and will be held against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney, we'll... But Allen's evidence has already been destroyed! You mean this? But the... The drive I gave your friend was just some photographs. But this... this is the one that's gonna win my case. Do you understand these rights that have been read to you? Yeah. Clarice... Do me favor. Tell everyone the sale to Sloane Halligan is off. I think it's what my father would've wanted. Miss Anderson, Miss Anderson! So now that the patent has been awarded to Dr. Cooke, what's next for you? Seeing Orbik Tech and it's executives held accountable for the death of James Allen. They and their associates are not above the law. What about your former colleague, Bruce Harris? Due process overdue. Mr. Harris will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. You haven't seen the last of us yet. Thank you. Mrs. Sarnowski. Any comment? What do you think I'm gonna say? Hurray, we lost? We plan to appeal. No further comments. Nice work counselor. Hope to see you on the battlefield again soon. Or the ladies' room. Counselor, may I add my congratulations. I must admit, I owe much of my success to a certain member of the law enforcement community. And how exactly do you plan to repay him? I'm sure I can think of something... You still have those handcuffs? So, can I ask you a question? Is this an interrogation? Yes it is. When you handed him that flash drive, did you really give him our photos? I guess we'll have to take some new ones then. Hello? Who was that? Wrong number.
