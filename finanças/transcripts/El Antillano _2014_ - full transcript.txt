On July 25, 1898... ...mi|itary troops of the government of the United States of America... ...invaded the island of Puerto Rico. To the false interpreters of the Monroe Doctrine we must always answer... Yesi, America for Americans; but the Antilles for the Antilleans. That is our salvation. Betances. Have you listened to some leader of this country... ...to mention... ...Betances's figure? Of course not. Because he is a contradictory figure to everything that exists here. And then, he is... ...an unknown personality. And the colonialism... ...will try to keep hidden that figure... ...which is definitely the great figure of Puerto Rican patriotism. THE ANTILLEAN He is the darkest of the west... ...the world healer... ...the pioneer of good and brusque nationalism. He is the one in MayagUez that began to remove the garbage... ...guided by Ruiz Belvis, Salvi Brao and Basora He is the healer of the worker... ...and the one who was hit in the gunmen's mutiny. lt's him, the one who's angered by cholera... ...because the poor goes first and the soldiers of the navy to the line. He is the abysmal angel in front of the baptismal row. He is the original super doctor. The one in Santiago and Puerto Plata dominated the falls by bicycle. The one that from San Juan to Havana defeated malaria. The one who swept the hypocrites from France to Jamaica. The one who valued Hippocrates' oath. He is the doctor of the Caribbean... ...the one who gave you the 10 commandments of free man. He is the other face of Hostos... ...the surgeon of Haiti... ...the inspiration of Quisqueya... ...a bastion for French. He is the great emancipator... ...who, from Paris, celebrated that March 22, 1873. He is the one who called Mariana to make a flag that is still standing. lt's him, it's him, the one who threw on the board the Monroe Doctrine... ...the Platt Amendment, the Manifest Destiny... ...and everything the northern clown tried... ...to buy at the beginning of his empire. In medicine that does not discriminate, ask Dona lsabel. It is him, it's him the old soldier of the French Republic... ...who always was for the Puerto Rican. lt's him, he isthe revolution personified in man. He is the father of the poor. lt's him, it's him. He is the complication of Simplicia... ...and the substance of Salita that is the virgin of Borinquen... ...and although he never had children... ...he is the father of the Homeland. lt's him, he is the blue of Manuel Rojas... ...the of Mathias Brugman... ...he who from beyond the seas... ...was the architect of that cry that is still heard far beyond Lares. lt's him, the one who wanted a single giantAntilla... ...the real Christ of Albizu, the Antillean is he. What do Puerto Ricans do? So they get out of the trance. And Betances speakto them. Son of a Dominican father and a Puerto Rican mother... ...Ramon Emeterio Betances was born... ...on April 8, 1827... ...in the town of Cabo Rojo. We are in the place known in Cabo Rojo as ...La Pileta... ...La Pileta was originally that jet of water... ...that goes back there... ...and the ladies came to wash their clothes here, on some large stones... ...that were on this shore. So, here... ...in the famous Pileta, it was where Betances scampered as a child. Onthis side... ...were the guava bushes... ...the famous bushes that are mentioned in the life of Betances... ...where he apparently entertained himself... ...eating guavas, because this was a huge guayabal. My Homeland is Puerto Rico whose memory obsesses me... My Homeland is Puerto Rico whose memory obsesses me... ...and believe... ...thatl do not commit myself to die... ...without returning to that unforgettable Cabo Rojo... ...to see again the guava bushes where I ran around as a child... ...and soak in the waters of La Pileta and perhaps rejuvenate my spirit. His father... ...who by the way... ...had one of the most important libraries... ...in the whole region of Puerto Rico... ...got private tutors... ...and these were the teachers... ...who shaped... ...the first years of education... ...of Ramon Emeterio... ...until he was 9 years old... ...and his mother died. And that's when his father sent him... ...to develop educationally... ...in Toulouse... ...in southern France. It was a Franco-Puerto Rican family... ...Prevost-Cavalliery... ...with whom there existed masonic relations. Which facilitated... ...the transfer of Ramon Emeterio to the south of France. There he was a student... ...an internal student of a school... ...the royal school of Toulouse... ...and when the holidays arrived... ...Christmas or Easter or summer holidays... ...he returned to that friend family... ...which lived about 30 kilometers from Toulouse, in a town called Grisolles. When he obtained these degrees... ...which were the ones that enabled him to enter French medical school... ...then he went in 1848... ...to study at the School of Medicine of the University of Paris. Fires, sticks, shotguns and stones... ..."Down monarchies!" he shouted along with the people of 1848. When it comes to freedom... ...all peoples are supportive. In 1848 there was a... ...revolution in Europe. Thousands... ...of... ...French... ...tookto the streets of Paris... ...erected barricades... ...some of three meters high. Poverty was degrading. That revolution that was made in two stages... ...in February and June of 1848... ...is the Bourgeois Democratic Revolution of France... ...which overthrew the monarchy... ...established universal suffrage... ...abolished slavery. The 1848 revolution... ...was translated for the Antillean... ...as the emancipation of the black slaves... ...of Guadeloupe, Martinique and other French colonies of the Caribbean. And it would be very good to indicate... ...that Ramon Emeterio Betances... ...started his political practice... ...by participating in the French Revolution of 1848. We are in the Latin Quarter... ...at least in the part... ...where the Faculty of Medicine is... ...which is on our right. This is the same neighborhood that existed... ...when young Betances studied Medicine... ...here in Paris between 1848... ...and 1855. The latter was the year he defended his thesis. Now we're going to where he entered when he was a student... He lived nearby... ...we will see it later, about 200 meters from here. That is why it was not difficult to go to school... Look at the name of the street: Street of the School of Medicine. In this street everything is historic. Betances studied... Betances studied... ...at the medical school that was at the forefront... ...of medicine studies at international level. That was the medical school in Paris... ...and there he studied with Broca, Dubois... ...with a series of geniuses... ...and in 1855... ...he finished his studies... ...defending a doctoral thesis... ...on the causes of abortion. Betances not only looks at the clinical aspects... ...or purely physical aspects... ...but he also includes social motives... ...which put a woman in a position to abort... ...overwork, relationships that are not purely physical. He introduced that social dimension into medicine... ...which will be interesting in the future... ...because we are going to read in the 1890s... ...a series of articles on public hygiene of his authorship. Paris outraged, Paris destroyed, Paris martyred, but Paris liberated. - Are you French? - Yes. Would not you mind answering in a minute ortvvo... ...a question about Charles de Gaulle? Well, in general... ...he was president of the Republic... ...founder of the Fifth Republic. He was a great fighter... ...who fought and led the resistance in Great Britain... ...in France... but from Great Britain, better said. Charles de Gaulle is a person who... ...did a lot for France in the war. He is a person that is still very important today... ...because he knew how to lead the country with intelligence... ...because he is someone who had a military past... ...well... I do not know what else to say. And what else? although I remember, I think he was in contact... ...with Marshal Petain, I think... ...orwas in conflict with him, it is all I know about him. And I know the French appreciate him very much... ...this president... ...like Francois Miterrand and Goerges Pompidou. Thank you! Betances in his idea... ...he had studied in France, of course... ...but his intention was not... ...to settle in a developed country... ...but to return to his colonized... ...country, so the people... ...the poor people could benefit from his knowledge. Betances returned to Puerto Rico in the year 1856. Immediately after he returned... ...unfortunately... ...a terrible cholera epidemic occurred. And in that epidemic... ...you know... those affected were... ...the slaves, the blacks and the poor people of Puerto Rico. And thousands of deaths were accounted... ...for due to this epidemic. However, in the MayagUez region... ...which is where Betances was established as a doctor... ...a work team is also established... ...to tackle... ...the cholera epidemic. There is discovered and shown, notjust a doctor... ...a courageous doctor... ...who faces the disease, but who also helps... ...the poorest people... ...particularly the black population... ...of MayagUez. From there was born the affectionate nickname... ...of doctor of the poor and blacks. lfthe love of freedom... ...does not already have in our Borinquen another refuge than... ...the heart of the most unfortunate of all... ...the African's heart... ...slave of the slaves. Let us shake off the yoke of dishonor that bends us. This old house that is... ...a historic house... ...built in 1867... ...was the residence... ...of Dr. Ramon Emeterio Betances. Today so deteriorated... ...it needs more than ever... ...the prompt restoration... ...by the government of Puerto Rico... ...because this old house... ...of Dr. Betances... ...is, without a doubt... ...a historical relic. Having a slave... ...was to have an animal... ...the slave was not considered a man. It was more like a different animal. It did everything. And not only everything... ...but its owner had power even to abuse them... ...sexually. So, the one who was fighting against that kind of situation... ...had serious problems and had to face the first deportation. Betances in Puerto Rico... ...his attitude looked suspicious... ...because he bought slave children to set them free. To the abolitionists of the MayagUez region... ...that in the atrium of this holy church... ...bought the children slaves in the baptismal font... ...to reintegrate them to our society... ...as free men. Betances was a man who had a deep sense of social justice. That social justice is evident in his abolitionist sense. That is, he was abolitionist because that was simply social injustice. It is unfair that a man is the master of another man... ...or for a man to enslave another man. Besides... ...it began to establish... ...the independence movement, that Betances nationalism... ...through some organizations... ...grassroots organizations in cities... ...and in countrysides... ...contemplated in a constitution... ...drafted by... ...our independence fighters... ...of the 19th century. Wake up Borinqueno because they have given the signal... ...wake up from that dream, it's time to fight. The cry of Lares, really... ...militarily... ...was a failed movement... ...but its transcendence... ...does not stop there. The cry of Lares has a greater trascendence... ...ideologically, politically and spiritually... ...why? because it represents the will of the Puerto Rican people... ...to fight for their independence. And that is the seed... ...that is sown as the flag of struggle of the Puerto Ricans... ...which banishes the attitude of total inertia. They lacked a strong and capable boss... ...as Betances, who had been expelled... ...and what was missing, above all, was that simultaneous movement... ...as planned. A model of the Dominican flag is the one that rises in Lares... ...to see how influenced they were by the outbreak of these peasants. Obviously... ...the central figure is Betances... ...and Segundo Ruiz Belvis... ...is out and even Segundo Ruiz Belvis is killed... There was a follow-up of the Spanish... ...although it is not reported... ...I even publish in my book... ...an agent in Cuba... ...and what he said about espionage to Betances. Then, Betances had the responsibility... ...of carrying the ship, called Telegrafo... ...but the breakout was discovered... ...and they had to overtake it. A man named Calixto Romero Togores... ...who is related to Romero Basero. That Calixto Romero was an traitor... ...of the revolutionaries of Lares in 1868. That is, in good Spanish we would say... ...that he was a creep... ...of the Puerto Rican independence movement of '68. Man is not essential... ...but there are times when certain men... ...are basic. And the lack of his presence due to impossible circumstances... ...(at that time it was impossible... ...for Betances to get there)... ...contributed a lot. His militant attitude and his organizing capacity... ...would have been vital at that time. When the Republic of Lares is proclaimed... ...slavery is declared abolished in Puerto Rico... ...improvements are declared for braziers, peasants... ...and they were called free workers. But they were not very free... ...because they were subject to the ferreous law of patronage... ...and in particular to the legal obligation... ...to keep a notebook, as it was done in France before 48. Then, the worker called free had a notebook... ...where he wrote down which one was his master, where he worked. ...where he wrote down which one was his master, where he worked. Undoubtedly, Lares revendication is highly advanced... ...and proposed the equality of all Puerto Rican citizens. This fact would provoke later... ...that the Spanish government itself... ...without existing in Puerto Rico... ...the warlike urgencies that occurred in Cuba... ...decided, to counteract the constant rise of the struggle... ...extend the abolition of slavery. Everything comes from there, from Lares. Within that period did not prosper... ...revolutionary projects... ...and it was very important then... ...the Betances solidarity act of transferring... ...the money collected by the patriots... ...weapons and ammunition deposited in different hiding places... ...in the Caribbean region. Crossing all this was an act of solidarity... ...extraordinary... Keep in mind that the Spanish crown, the Spanish metropolis... ...was living at the moment, so to speak... ...from the riches they brought from the Antilles. The only two colonies that were left to Spain... ...in the Antilles were Puerto Rico and Cuba. The Philippines was beyond, but in the Antilles: Puerto Rico and Cuba. Lares. .. ...personally for me... ...was not a failure. Lares. .. ......was ...the definition of something different... ...and this did not mean that we were Spanish... ...here is a moment when this began to be decided. Compensate! Doctor... ...Haiti is sick. lts right breast... ...Dominican Republic... ...its oligarchs detest its dark nipple. Its left wing... ...Cuba free... ...extended wing deals... ...and little embraces it. If you were closer... ...you, my black Jamaica. Doctor... ...Haiti is sick. Its left wing... ...your homeland in chains... ...my younger sisters... ...the big ones, almost do not speak each other. Could your words make up leap years? Doctor, your vision could bring the Antilles closer. Then, during that period... ...Betances arrived and settled in Haiti. But also the people who had participated in the Cry of Lares... ...who had to leave Puerto Rico... ...after gaining freedom in that period... ...they also went to... ...Haiti... ...to accompany Betances. The great thing about the project of Betances... ...is that at times when there were undoubtedly prejudices... ...racial prejudices, cultural prejudices... ...Betances incorporated Haiti into this project... ...incorporated Dominican Republic... ...wrote about Toussaint Louverture... ...and about Petion. What interest did Betances have? He was trying... ...to highlight, to praise... ...the cultural and political possibilities of the black man. The first nation in Latin America... ...was the United States... ...which proclaimed its independence, but it was the first nation... ...of former slaves. I mean, it was a peculiar case. In America, anyone who tried... ...a revolutionary movement... ...or an independence movement... ...had to seek the necessary help... ...from them. The brother who was also called Felipe... ...participated in Lares and... ...and settled in Jacmel. And we still have then... ...a strain of the Betances... ...in Haiti... ...that comes from that brother... ...of Betances that remained forever... ...in that country. And he never returned to Cabo Rojo... ...of his childhood. What does Dessalines mean to you? What does Dessalines mean to you? For us Haitians, Dessalines was a savior... ...in histime, because... ...when you look at... ...the Haitians who were brought from Africa... ...and even Dessalines in histime went through the slavery... ...and realized that he could not stay there. It was then that he rebelled to give independence to his country. That's why I can say today... ...he is a man who will never be forgotten. ...and everything he has done will be remembered. Dessalines is a great hero for us... ...for the people. And why do you think it was important to have independence? Itwas important to be free... ...to get us out of slavery... ...to have freedom. Dessalines was a great man... ...who fought to get us out of... ...slavery. Today we live a moment where... ...where white people are directing us... ...we lost our power... ...we lost our goal. When Betances returned to France... ...he supported young Haitians a lot... ...who acted to promote... ...the image of his land... ...by saying the past is the result of colonial history... ...but that the black man was much more worth than what was said then... ...and that there is evidence of this in history as Toussaint Louverture... ...Petion and others. His main political support in the Dominican Republic... ...was the Dominican General Gregorio Luperon. This man, besides having a political identification... ...with the revolutionary ideology of Betances... ...was his compadre and they were deeply identified. Ramon Emeterio Betances and General Gregorio Luperon... ...a figure of Dominican independence... ...a mulatto of modest origin... ...had a friendship born... ...during the war called Restauradora. Betances was very identified... ...with the progressive struggles... ...of the Dominican people. The Betances rifles... ...that is, the arms... ...of the Puerto Rican independence movement... ...were put at the disposal of General Gregorio Luperon... ...when the Dominican were fighting against... ...the dictatorship of Buenaventura Baez. And they had a ship... ...a hired ship... ...called El Telegrafo. Betances helped Luperon... ...getthis ship. And Luperon traveled in El Telegrafo and changed its name... ...and gave it the name Restauracion. Thus, Luperon bombed San Felipe fortress in Puerto Plata... ...and occupied militarily Samana. In this document, Betances calligraphy... ...is unmistakable. His handwriting was unmistakable, it was small. And what's below is not Betances calligraphy. Here is the signature of Gregorio Luperon... ...with the three points of man of Masonry. That is, Betances wrote the letters of Gregorio Luperon... ...and Luperon signed them. Luperon wrote a beautiful letter... ...against President Grant. Many people have said it was Betances who wrote that letter... ...but it was not really him. And we know it because the letter has that language... ...we have studied in Luperon. Obviously, Luperon wrote it. It was a letter to President Grant... ...which spoke of "you" as an intellectual of the Betances category... ...and that's why we can't deny Betances corrected it. They were there and the letter has a very high level of writing... ...and Betances corrected it and... and who doubts... ...Betances said Luperon any idea? Because they were together... ...permanently. What we did conclude... ...is that they... ...established an agreement. But a political agreement of war... ...a subversive war like this one... ...can not be left written. There was an unspoken agreement... ...we are going to prevent the annexation of the United States... ...the Dominican Republic and we are going to overthrow Baez. And the second step was... ...we are going to develop the struggle for independence in Puerto Rico. Oh, Sun, eternal luminary... ...laughing in the nest and the portal of the palaces... ...incendiary spark that shines immortal! Oh, you of the innumerable fire... ...who shines in the universe... ...and pierces the insurmountable shadow.. ...giving light to the captive there immersed! That you bless, fruitful and you can... ...awaken the sleeping bush... ...that from above, in golden nets... ...you have the worlds suspended. Your sweet splendor and benefactor creates heat... ...dilates the day... ...but it does not have, I would say... ...the strength of a ray of love. Can you tell me who is Juan Pablo Duarte? Can you tell me who is Juan Pablo Duarte? Of course. He isthe father of our homeland. He is the father of our homeland. The one who gave independence to each one of us. For him we are free and independent. Why is it important for you to be free and independent? Because we do not want any foreign country to come and impose a yoke on us. Or comes to submit us. It is very good to be free and sovereign beings. We are free and sovereign. We do not want yoke, neither foreigners, norAmericans... ...because the Americans, sorry, since you're from Puerto Rico... ...the Americans always put their boots in the countries of Latin America. These countries are always being trampled. They live from the war. Who was Juan Pablo Duarte? Well, if you ask me, you have difficulty... ...because I am "sanchizta", not "duartista". Juan Pablo Duarte appears as the father of the Homeland... ...but for me the true father of the country is Francisco del Rosario sanchez. He was the one who was here when the coup ocurred. The one who struck was Francisco del Rosario sanchez. Duarte was in Curacao and he did not even know what was being done here. My criterion is that Duarte is very meritorious... ...but the greatest merit he has is that he was blond and Sanchez was black. He was son of a butcher and grandson of slave... ...and they were not going to give him the Patriarchate of the Homeland. And what can you tell about Gregorio Luperon? Ahh, that was a great man... ...a man with a lot of courage, great integrity. ...and he was the hero of the Restauracion... ...or one of them, because there were several. And do not you happen to know Ramon Emeterio Betances? Who was Ramon Emeterio Betances? He was a Puerto Rican independence leader... ...who came here and received help from Luperon. Like Eugenio Maria de Hostos, the great master. ...if I remember correctly, in 1868 or 1869... ...not before that. Why? Because Hostos... ...studied in Madrid... ...and in those years... ...1868, 1869... ...he thought there was a reformist solution. And within his ideology that was federal at that time... ...Hostos thought of a great... ...Hispanic confederation of the world... ...with Madrid as the metropolitan capital... ...and La Habana and San Juan as autonomies. Betances is the radical man... ...the radical revolutionary... ...anti-imperialist... ...he is the revolutionary that said at a given moment... ..."if you want revolution... ...as an omelet, you have to beat the eggs". "There is no revolutionary without breaking eggs... ...or beating them to cookthe omelet". You can not be so forgiving, you can not walk on average terms. If you want an omelet, you have to break and beat the eggs. That's a very boricua expression, very nice, but... ...but it lets us see that sense of the radicality... ...of his revolutionary ideology. Eugenio Maria de Hostos was a great thinker... ...a consequential revolutionary... ...who thought very well about the future of Puerto Rico... ...the potentialities of its people... ...but in some aspects, perhaps, he had more patience. So, between the initial radicalism of Betances... ...we are talking about the years 1860 and 1865... ...and the initial reformism of Hostos... ...there is a frontier. Now... ...when the independence movement began... ...Hostos soon realized his mistake... ...and he also became another independentist... ...of the same ideological force... ...and the same temper as Betances. And Hostos would say in his memories... ..."At least, Betances learned one thing... ...and that is to make an omelet... ...you have to breakthe eggs first". When Hostos... ...invited Betances... ...to accompany him on a revolutionary... ...project against colonialism in Puerto Rico... ...they both were cited... ...in Santo Domingo. And then, Betances who already knew... ...the great Dominican revolutionaries... ...headed by Gregorio Luperon... ...is the one who introduced Luperon to Hostos. From that moment... ...from that year forward, 1875, I can say it... ...they treated each other like what they were... ...tvvo great brothers. Do you know who Ramon Emeterio Betances was? Of course I do. Of course I do. Who was he? Ramon was a Puerto Rican hero... ...and he was a leader of the revolution. He fought hard for the freedom of Puerto Rico... ...and here in this park we have a statue of him... ...as a symbol of the freedom of the Americas. What else do you know about Puerto Rico? Puerto Rico is the island of enchantment. As the old saying goes... Cuba and Puerto Rico are, from a bird, the two wings. Do you know who Jose Marti was? Yes, Jose Marti is the hero of the Homeland. What did he do? Jose Marti fought for our people to be free... ...and he is currently the idol of our people. That is, today he is the one who has emerged from the battles... ...little by little, that is the idol that has all the ideas... ...and we carry his ideas and fight with them. The idea of being free. And what is the phrase that you like most about him? The phrase that! like most about him is... ..."that a people has to be cultured to be free". Jose Marti... Jose Marti is our National Hero. He, like Ramon for Puerto Rico, fought hard for the freedom of Cuba... ...he organized many battles, we can say that he was the thinking head... ...of the revolutionary group of the time. He traveled to the United States and he was the one who said... ..."I lived in the monster and I know the entrails". - He met the United States and lived there. - He is the Apostle. The Apostle Jose Marti was the greatest man Cuba had. He died in Dos Rios. Thank you. He was a man of ideas, yes. Send a message to Puerto Rico. Long live Puerto Rico, brother of Cuba. We love you very much, someday we can meet and... ...link hand in hand, because... ...it is a beloved brother country. Puerto Rico has the same flag as us, but its colors are inverted. We are very similar and that is why we love Puerto Ricans very much. Long live Puerto Rico. Jose Marti, our hero, the apostle of our independence... ...referred to Betances and called him: "that wonderful old man". When Betances was already a venerable fighter... ...anti-imperialist, Marti was in the beginning of his struggle. That's when he requested Betances effort... ...and help for support in the Cuban Revolutionary Party. Marti and Betances could never shake their hands... ...they could never hold each other... ...but the love and admiration... ...that Marti had for Betances... ...can be seen in the writings... ...of Jose Marti. When you read Marti' woks... ...you can appreciate... ...that extraordinary feeling. From Paris, Betances performed as revolutionary... ...the most effective, most radical work... ...and the most consistent work that had made any other revolutionary... ...in emigration. ...in Paris. And from Paris, from all over the world, because... ...we have to keep in mind that Betances was writing there... ...not only his newspaper called El Antillano... ...whose articles he signed with the same name... ...but from there he was sending articles... ...to other publications that already knew his name. That environment is what makes... ...EI Antillano become spokesman... ...almost unofficial ambassador... ...of three republics that had not been born yet. Of 26 in a thousand seas, one remains in the Caribbean... ...which does not understand the mishaps that await the Caribbean. That the Yankees are gossipers, cheaters and troublemakers... ...and to this day carry the luck of getting away with it. There are 100 thousand Puerto Ricans who do not love their country... ...promoting this life to uproot... ...the long tradition of Caribbean struggle... ...the blood spilled quisquellana and borinquena. In the middle ofthe war in Cuba... ...Spain had an extremely aggressive attitude... ...and this attitude... ...was raised by Canovas del Castillo... ...prime minister. He even said that the war in Cuba... ...could end with two happy shots. One to Maceo and another to Gomez. That was the slogan of Canovas del Castillo. So we can see how good he was, do not you think? Two happy shots! One to Maceo and another to Gomez! Then, this warwas followed internationally... ...an Italian anarchist named Angiolino... ...took Canovas' words... ...and said: if with two happy shots the war is over... ...then with a happy shot we can counteract this. In that moment... ...went through England... ...this Italian man... ...and acquired there... ...a revolver... ...a homemade revolver. Then, he arrived in Paris... ...and met Betances there. What happened? Well, everyone knew the representative of Cuba Libre in Europe... ...was Betances. There is a historical interview.. ...prior to the events... ...betvveen Betances and Agiolino. You can not say that Betances ordered him, it's impossible... ...what we are sure is that Betances... ...did not dissuade him either. Canovas del Castillo was... ...enjoying... ...some thermal baths... ...in Spain... ...and Agiolino... ...arrived there. And by three shots of that revolver... ...Angiolino ended the life of the prime minister... ...of Spain. Ultimately it can be said that... ...it was an act of anarchy. It was not anarchy... ...it was individual heroism... ...because whatAngiolino did was... ...to represent the indignation of all the peoples... ...before these abuses of Canovas del Castillo. When the French press asked Betances... ...about all these matters... ...he replied: "No, we do not applaud it... ...but we do not reject it either". Where is your light? Where are your eyes? Where is your resolution? Where is that attitude of gallantry and courage... ...and greatness that brings us to this rostrum... ...which brings us to the presence of the venerated ashes of the great Patricio... ...of the great father of the Homeland? Where are we? Here, as the great poet said a moment ago... ...the earth shook... ...so that a petal emerged from it... ...so that a cocoon would emerge from it! A cocoon must be the precious flower of the greatest soul of the Nation... ...of the soul of Betances. Where are the hearts here? Where are the village chants? Where are the big children of this town? That could be the Virgin of Betances. How to give up our greatness? Why bury us in a world of filth... ...in a world of material greed... ...in a world of bribes... ...in a world of slaves? Why does not this town get up... ...to the greatness that called the father of the Homeland? Get up, men from Cabo Rojo! Get up, Puerto Ricans! Get up, Puerto Rico's women! Reject the courtship of cowards! Reject the courtship of the traitors of the Homeland! Those who do not love the Homeland are unworthy of the sweet look... ...of a great woman born on the land. FREEDOM The great love of his life... ...was an unhappy love, as we know After his studies in Paris, Betances... ...returned to Puerto Rico... ...and in one of these returns... ...he fell in love with his niece Carmencita. And on this same avenue... ...called Boulevard Boulangerie... ...Don Ramon Emeterio Betances... ...rented an apartment... ...of course, bigger and more beautiful... ...than the one in which he lived before... ...so he could marry his girlfriend Carmen Henry. And now maybe it surprises us... "How is it going to be that of falling in love with his niece"? What happens is that they had grown up absolutely separated... ...they did not know each other... ...and she was a niece on the part of a sister, in short. These are unusual things... ...which perhaps should not be... ...but they are. While the wedding was being prepared, Carmen Henry... ...was living in a house... ...of friends outside Paris... ...near Fontainebleau, about 50 km south. It was at that time... ...when she contracted the terrible typhoid fever... ...which at that time had no cure. Then, Betances brought her to Paris... ...to be closer to the doctors... ...and especially closer to him... ...who was a doctor. And she lived in this house... ...attended by some friends... ...and there she died... ...as we already know on April 23, 1858. What should be my sights? What my hopes? My dead hopes... ...have been buried with her, who inspired them. I do not know what curse has fallen on me. I have to live in despair without ever understanding so much injustice. After she died... ...Betances idealized her... ...and he wrote a story... called... ...The Virgin of Borinquen. And, of course, she isthe virgin of Borinquen... ...the beloved who had died in his arms... ...and he was so sad because... ...not only for having taken her to that place... ...but also because he had not been able to take care of her... ...and cure her. Carmencita would notjust be the lost beloved... ...but the Puerto Rican Homeland... ...that he could not lose at that time. He had to give his life for that Borinquena Homeland. This was a beautiful symbol and so he assumed it. We knew later... ...that Betances married a good Puerto Rican woman... ...named Simplicia... ...who was good, consistent... ...with Betances, she was a good partner... ...for his life. Dear Simplicia... "I have been thinking of you since I got here. I have so many achievements to fulfill... ...that the best of all is to feel that I have conquered you. There is no poetry that describes my love. I will never be anything without you. I promise to write you more". Betances was exiled three times... ...he did not return to Toulouse... ...but to Paris. And there he settled... ...for 26 years... ...and then hejoined... ...as an assistant... ...to some famous doctors... ...of the faculty. That is, he not only satisfied himself with... ...healing... ...but he also became a medical researcher. It must be said that Betances... ...became one of the best doctors in Paris. This is easily said... ...but it must be assumed in the 19th century. Betances had several medical specialties... ...one of them was obstetrics... ...and the other was about the general problems of surgery... ...and internal medicine. When the Spanish Republic... ...displaced Queen Elizabeth II in 1868... ...she went to France. There she got sick... ...and knowing that Betances was one of her enemies... ...more agressive enemies... ...accepted that he was the doctor who treated her. How an individual, registered as an enemy... ...deals with someone's own health... ...and makes that someone recover its health. And the thing is she had a record of how formidable this doctor was... ...and therefore faced with the dilemma... ...she accepted that he treated her... ...and obviously, without hesitation... ...he took great pains to take care of her. When the cause of Cuba's independence was already well advanced... When the cause of Cuba's independence was already well advanced... ...and Betances was somehow... ...monitored for living in France... ...which was the cradle of freedom... ...supposedly already. Blasco stopped going, he only went there when he was sick... ...but he suffered an accident... ...his horse carriage overturned... ...and he received bruises, had a fracture... ...and all this came out in the press because Blasco was a political figure. Betances quickly went to see him. He did not wait for Blasco to call him. He went there and treated him as a patient. And Blasco never forgot that. He even said: "You do not want to come see an integrist"... ...and Betances answered... "And it is not convenient for you... ...that a revolutionary independentist come to see you. Shall we have a coffe? Or what?" Betances was named holy doctor in Puerto Plata... ...because people believed that his cures were miraculous... ...when he operated from a possible cataract to a lady... ...who had never seen sunlight before. It is possible that she suffered from congenital cataracts... ...and he practiced surgery... ...on this lady that resulted in a miracle. But without a doubt, the miracle was the scientific capacity of this man. There are those who thought... ...and why did not he dedicate himself exclusively to medicine? Because he had a social and political commitment... ...that was unavoidable for him. Hence its greatness. Early 1898... ...ocurred the explosion... ...of the battleship Maine... ...right on the port of Havana. There, immediately... ...the tabloid press of the United States... ...began to agitate the military intervention in Cuba. We can say that the final line of life of Ramon Emeterio Betances... ...the great Antillean... ...was truly dramatic, I think. Everything he had been fighting for... ...so that the United States would not intervene Puerto Rico... ...and the Antilles... ...all that for which he had been fighting... ...which had been, of course, the dream of Jose Marti... ...with the Cuban Revolutionary Party... ...he saw it was imminent that it happened. He is appealing to everything he can. Why do Puerto Ricans do not rebel? Betances was a permanent fighter... ...against that idea of delivering the island to a foreign potency. Actually, at any potency... ...because he knew that the most dangerous for the future... ...was United States ofAmerica. For the vision of this country of domination, expansion... ...throughout the Caribbean. He knew very well he was dying... ...he had serious kidney problems... ...and at that time, 1898... ...there was no dialysis process... ...the artifitial cleaning of the kidney... ...to help it function... ...there was no dialysis and Betances as a good doctor... ...knew he was dying. He knew it. He was perfectly lucid. And of course, he was a little abandoned... ...he was alone... ...but not that much. Imagine, just one or two months after his death... ...a survey was made... ...in a Puerto Rican newspaper... ...to say in people's opinion... ...what is the person that best represented... ...the aspiration of independence in our country? The number one of that survey was Betances. He was number one and that way it was shown he was well known... ...when the peace treaty of Paris had not been signed yet. And from his bed... ...agonizing... ...he said the following... ..."I believe in the future independence... ...of my country. She alone, by agreement of the other Antilles... ...is capable to save us from the American minotaur. I believe in freedom and in the Republic. I believe in them for my Homeland... ...where the intelligent men abound... ...and good men too. The big ones are not big but because we are on our knees. Let's get up! And after that he said... But... Why do Puerto Ricans do not rebel? Because already in the year 1898... ...the invasion of the Yankees by the Guanica was quite advanced. And Betances was desperate. He wrote to Lola Rodriguez de Tio... ...and he told other Puerto Ricans to talkto Lola... ...and said: why do Puerto Ricans do not rebel? And in that last agony... ...for his Homeland was that Betances closed his eyes forever... ...on September 16, 1898. That is, until the last moment of his life... ...Betances was energetic, passionate, in love... ...with the freedom of his country. - Were you on Betances avenue? - Yes. And who was Betances? I don't know. - This is Betances avenue? - Right. Here in Bayamon. That's right! And you don't have any information about Betances? No. I've been working here for two weeks. I will call the owner for you. We are in front of the house of Ramon Emeterio Betances... ...can you tell us who was Betances? No, I can't. I have no idea. Well, this street is called Ramon Emeterio Betances... ...and that was the house where he lived. - Don't you know anything about him? - No, not right now Excuse me, we are here, in front of Betances. Can you tell us who was he? Who was Ramon Emeterio Betances, Sergio? They are filming me, Sergio. Hello, we are here in Betances street... ...can you tell us who Betances was? We are investigating. I learned that in fourth grade... You don't remember? No, I do not remember. You have no idea? Nothing at all? - Are you Puerto Rican? - Of course. - Have you lived your whole life in Puerto Rico? - Yes. And they did not teach you at school who was Betances? Yes. - But you don't remember. - I forgot about it. Excuse me! I was wondering if you can tell us who was... ...Don Ramon Emeterio Betances? Can you tell us? You don't know? I know he was a leader... Hey, hey... ...do you want to talk to the camera? Paito. .. ...I'm in a bad moment in the game now and I can not... Just a little question. We are working on a documentary about Betances... ...and we wanted to know if you could tell us something about him. Anyhting about Betances you can tell us. Well, he is the Father of our Homeland. - We do not know much about him. - I know he is very important in Puerto Rico. Really important! I will most likely recognize him if! hear abouthim... ...but right now! do not remember. Why is that? Why do you think people don't remember him? Because it depends on Puerto Rican education and politics. We study in the Faculty of Natural Sciences... ...and we do not have such an education... ...specific to Puerto Rican culture... ...what we really know is science, mathematics... ...that are systematic things. We are also aware of other things... ...but the history of Puerto Rico... I think it's something that... It's great that you're doing that documentary because... ...we need the history of Puerto Rico in education. - Thank you. - You're welcome! If you had the opportunity to travel to any country on the planet... ...and someone ask you... ...who is the most important Puerto Rican character in history... ...who would you say it is? I believe that Puerto Rico has moments that marked milestones... ...which represent course changes in the country. Ramon Power y Giralt is our first hero... ...where it is galvanizes the existence... ...of a different nation... ...of a different people... ...separated from any metropolis and this is the Puerto Rican people. 50, 60 or 70 years later... ...the deed of Ruiz Belvis and Betances... ...consolidated what had begun at the beginning of the 19th century... ...by Ramon Power in the courts of Spain. Then, Baldorioty de Diego Munoz Rivera... ...and later, the main transformation... ...the deepest social change the country has had... ...was under Luis Munoz Marin. And if I had to choose one, it would be him. On July, 25, 1952... ...the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is established. This political condition has been denounced as a colonial condition. What do you think of the Commonwealth... ...which is the current relationship between Puerto Rico and the USA? What do you think? Puerto Rico is or is not a colony? No, Puerto Rico is not a colony... This goes against the very definition of colony... ...because the status form that exists in this country was not imposed... ...but it has been chosen by Puerto Ricans, so... Do you believe that mostAmericans... ...would be in favor of Puerto Rico being the 51st state? Puerto Rico has the capacity to be a free, sovereign and independent country? Puerto Rico has the capacity to be it. Now it is important to understand that... ...in my opinion, there are differences that must be highlighted. Puerto Rico has the capacity to be it, but freedom of a formula... ...of a country's relationship with the rest of the world... ...the legitimacy of that formula... ...does not arise from the texts... ...but arises from the will of those peoples. What happens is that Puerto Rico... ...has decided freely not to opt for that formula. Betances. .. ...is the most important figure that this country has had... ...in its history. That is without a doubt. I do not have the slightest doubt. For more than 30 years... ...I have been studying the life and work of Betances. There is no figure like him. It is not about that image of a crude... ...rude revolutionary, who shouts... ...who, to convince, offends... ...and that ultimately tells you: "if you do not think like me... ...go away!" and then he pushes you. Betances is a gentleman... ...as Jose Marti was... ...that is why they are men who must be paradigms for all revolutionaries... ...and ethically for all people. We must see Betances as one of the Iiberators. The Iiberator is not only the military commander... ...who arrives after a series of campaigns... ...and battles... ...to expel the foreign master... ...but Betances is a Iiberator... ...of ideas... ...of people... ...of values... ...and Iefts. That's why I say that he is in a certain way... ...the last Iiberator of the 19th century. And that's why he fought... ...and that's why he sacrificed himself. His professional ability... ...is the struggle to bequeath... ...with the example of his attitudes... ...that Puerto Rico was viable. And I thinkthat's the most important thing. That is the legacy of Betances. That is the legacy that sooner or later... ...that self-determination will come. He is the father of the Puerto Rican Homeland! ...that generous people... ...attribute to... ...their most sacrificed son. And that was Betances. He was the most sacrificed... ...of the children of this nation... ...throughout the 19th century. THE ANTILLEAN I am Antillean. Translated and subtitled by: YMH.
