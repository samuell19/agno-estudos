- Ayla, stop. - I'm done talking. - This won't stop anything! Ayla, please. Let's talk to the others. Some of them are on our side. Go. Run! Run! Run! - Hey, hey, hey! - Patrolling officer in pursuit! Hey! - Hey! Stop! Stop! Get back here now! Stop! Get down on the ground! Stop! Ah, Jesus Christ! It's only gonna be worse for you! Get down on the ground! Stop! - Shit! - Show me your hands! Don't you move. Stay right there! I'm not gonna say it again. Hands now! - You're making a mistake. - On your knees. - Backup needed, 1000 block off of Welland. - Let's go. Come on. I'm not gonna keep repeating myself. On the ground now. - I'm not going with you. - I'm sorry, missy. That's not how this works. - Actually, that's exactly how this works... 'cause you won't like the alternative. I promise you that. - Hey! Get back! - You wanna go home tonight? - What is that, a threat? - It's a chance. - Okay. I'll give you three seconds to get on the ground. You understand? Stop, stop! - If she takes one more step, I'm gonna pull the trigger. That's what you're thinking, right? You, not so much. Now, you are. - Fuck! - Oh, shit! Hey, hey! Stop! - Ayla! What the hell happened? - Seriously? - What? - You started it. - You... give it to me. I'm hungry. Not my problem. - Ha-ha! - Good touch sensation. - Where are you going? - I told you I quit! - You can't quit! We're a team! Two peas in a pod! - Ugh! Those are gonna be black-eyed peas if you don't get out of my... - What went wrong? - The cup, I wasn't expecting you to drop it. - Projections need to be fully formed fictions, not reactant to the victim. When you do what we can do, you make victims of people. - I know. - I know you know. It just bears repeating. Did you feel the pull? - Yeah. I kept it back. - Good. And let's do it again. - Are you serious? Why? - Because you're not fully in control. These abilities only work if you are in control. If you let that power take over... - People can die. I know. But you don't let me use them outside of the house, so I think humanity is safe. My show is on. - I know your show is on. That's all you're thinking about. - I hate when you do that. - Then learn how to keep me out. Again. - About a dozen downtown businesses were boarded up Wednesday, and glass-littered sidewalks following two nights of protests. This morning, there were few people on the streets as the city school board shut down all schools in the downtown metro area. - Why are you watching that? It just makes you mad. - It's good to know what people are saying. - They say the same shit every day. - Someday, they may say something different. It's our early warning system. - Hiya, hiya, hiya! I'm Mad Matty, the mattress master! And I'm here to tell you that our hybrid memory foam line is on sale! - Yeah, we're getting early warning signs about the latest mattress sales. Time for school. - You know, maybe I could read something different today? Something with an actual plot? - Life doesn't have a plot. - Yeah, that's why books should. - You're 16. You want fairy tales? We're not like normal people, Ro. There's a reason I make you read the books I do. - "Virtue Ethics and Utilitarianism"? I know right from wrong. I don't need a 300-page book to tell me. - The point of that book is that power has a way of diminishing moral senses. - What does that even mean? - That we have a choice. And how we use these abilities when we're out there in the world, when it's not just me and you... those choices matter. If you get stopped, taken, what do you do? - Mom. - Tell me what. - I tell them nothing. - What do you show them? - Nothing. - What happens if they go into your memories? - I forget. - Forget what? - As much as I can. - How? - I think of anything else? - Use an anchor. - An anchor memory. Right, yeah. An anchor memory. - And you fight. You fight as long and as hard as you can. And where will I be? - The bus stop on the 730 line off of Route 80, exit 3. - That's right. - I told you I quit! - You can't quit! We're a team! Two peas in a pod! - Ugh! Those are gonna be black-eyed peas if you don't get out of my way! - Hey, I'm sorry. - You talk, but I don't believe it. I'm gone! - Well, what about... Um, what about my dead cat? - You never had a cat! - Exactly my point! So help me fix this before our parents get back! - Why should I? - Well, because it wasn't exactly my fault! - You hate what we read, but you love this garbage? - Yup. It's my only way of seeing regular people. - You seen regular people? That's not how they are. - What? You always... - Well, it's closer than how we live. - Then why are you surprised? At least I'm consistent! - I'm going out for supplies. - Now, that's ridiculous! - You mean shopping? Can I come? - Not this time. - Why not? - Stay here with your regular people. - I'm worried they're up to something. - ♪ [vocalizing] Yeah, yeah, yeah ♪ ♪ Why you gotta do me like that ♪ ♪ Do me like that, yeah, yeah, yeah ♪ ♪ Why you gotta do me like, do me like that? ♪ ♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah ♪ - What do you think? - I think it's really good. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Okay, well, obviously, I still gotta, like, work on the lyrics and all that and... And find someone who can sing 'em. Do you sing? Oh, no. I mean, I... I wouldn't call it singing. - So, um... Okay, I-I kinda made you something. It's stupid. - You made this? Yeah. - Could you? So, um, tomorrow, I'm hanging out with some friends. And, uh, I'd really like it if you'd come. - I don't know. - Well, I know you're shy or whatever, but it could be really fun. And it'll only be a few of us. - Okay, but, like, how many is a few? I don't know. You want, like, a guest list or something? - No. I just... You're my only friend. And adding anything onto that is a big deal. - Well... I think you can handle it. Plus, what's the worst thing that could happen? - Shit, she's home early. I gotta go! - Uh, tomorrow night? - Uh, we'll see! - We're meeting by the old school! - Okay! - Perfect towel! The most absorbent material ever! - You haven't moved since I left. - Yeah. This is, like, my favorite show. - The perfect towel attracts liquid like a magnet. It doesn't matter if it's club soda... - Right. - Even red wine! - Shit. - So what's his name? - Whose name? - The boy you were just with. - There isn't any... - We're not playing that game. - towel is odor-free! Now, you can see... - Then pick a different game. - You wanna keep secrets? Then shield them better in your mind. - How about you stay out of my head and give me some privacy? Or, you know, stay in one place long enough for me to make some friends? Have a life? - We're leaving on Friday. - What? Why? Why? I don't get a say-so? - No, you don't get a say-so. - It has the strength and the muscle to pick up and hold over 30 ounces of liquid! The perfect towel attracts liquid like a magnet! It doesn't matter if it's club soda, even red wine. - Move this box across the room. - I've never moved anything that heavy before. - It's not a car, Ro. If you're strong enough to pick it up with your arms, you can pick it up with your mind. You need to tap into that energy to move heavier objects and not lose control. From there to the coffee table. - Fine. - Good. Hold it there. And when you're ready, start moving it. Remember, Ro, trust your power. I trust my power. - Ro, look at me! Fight it, Ro! Damn it! - Okay. - That's why you don't get a say-so. You're not ready. - I could have fought it off! You barely gave me a chance! - Do you think they'll give you a chance? - Okay, I get it! - You have to learn to control these abilities without me there to help you! One mistake, one, and they will find you! You get that? - Mom, you're hurting me! What is wrong with you? - I'm just trying... Trying to give you the tools to protect yourself. - From who? No one is coming for us, Mom! There is no they! You and all your bullshit, your lessons, "Project this, move that." I am... I am sick of it! I didn't ask for these powers. And if I could give them back, I would. My life is shit because of them! - About earlier... - Forget it. What album is it? - You like them, right? Goodnight. - Night. - We might just have to leave early. - Wow. - Just gotta to figure it out. - No, I want you to... I need you to... I need... - Hey! Where are you going? Come over here! See? I told you she'd come. - I'm just shocked she exists, bro. - She actually kinda hot. - Hey, bro, shut up! - 50 bucks says she's not hot, bro. - Hey. Hi. Hi. - You okay? - Yeah. - Um, do you wanna go somewhere just us? - No. I wanna meet your friends. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Okay. So that's Aaron. - Yo. - That's Calah. That's Dina. - And that's Caleb. I'm embarrassed by all of them. We're embarrassed by you. - Hey, come over here. How much is his mom paying you to hang out with him? - Don't answer that, okay? - Don't tell her what to do. Um, a lot. - I knew it! She got you on a payment plan? - She gets paid every Friday, all right? Now drop it. - That's why your mom stays broke. - You don't go to Thomas Jefferson, right? - Um, Thomas Jefferson? - Yeah. The school? - Uh, no. I'm... I'm homeschooled, I guess. - Shit. I wish I was homeschooled. - Trust me, you don't. Unless you want your mom as your teacher. - Yeah, that won't work. I hate my mom. I love your mom. - Shut up. - God, buddy, not again. - You live around here? - Yeah, over there. - You live in the Stevens Complex? - Uh, yeah. - I didn't think anyone but homeless people still live in those houses over there. - Bro, it's unhoused. - Idiot, homeless people don't have homes. - Unhoused, dude. Come on. - All right, Mr. Woke. - You know what I mean, bro. - We're not... We're not homeless. - Whatever you say. Ew. - Bro. - What? - Whatever's in this tastes like ass. - That's top shelf. - Like you know what top shelf is. - It's top shelf. - Bottom of my ass shelf. - I think this is going well. - Top of what shelf? That's what you sip in London? - Um... - What is in this? - You want a drink? - Oh, um... - It's just Coke. - Okay, Zay, I see you. - What is in that? I'm not drinking that. Get out. No. This is bullshit. - So nobody wants this? - Um, do you wanna... Do you wanna sit? - Yeah, sure. - Okay. I should've put on a warmer jacket. I really like her. Hey, are you cold? She's weird. Maybe I should try and hold her hand. What's going on? He is such a simp. Why aren't I TikTok-famous yet? What does he even see in her? - You okay? - What's going on over there? - Nothing. We're just talking. - What's going on? Aurora. - What the hell is wrong with her? - Hey, what's going on over there, bro? - What was in that drink, Isaiah? - Nothing. Okay? - Stop it! Stop it! Stop! - Bro, she's freaking out. - What is she on? - I-I don't know. - Yo, Zay, take her ass home, bro. She's killing my high. - Guys, stop! - She's so weird. - Hey. Hey, talk to me. Breathe. I'm right here. It's okay. - Isaiah! Isaiah! There's blood everywhere! What did you do? What did you do? - I need... I need help. - We need an ambulance! - What did you do? That was our friend! - What's going on? - I need... I need help. I need... I need... - Ro! Ro? Shit! Ro, can you hear me? Ro, please, if you can hear this, just send me a message. Shit! Ro, meet me at the appointed place. Do not go home. God! - Hello? Is anyone there? Hello? Mom? Mom, are you there? I did something really, really bad. And I'm sorry, but I really, really need you right now. Mom, please. Please tell me you can hear me. No. Ah, you're awake. How you feeling? Are you okay? - No. - Okay, okay, okay. - Wh-where am I? - You're someplace safe. - How did I get here? - I heard your call for help. I brought you here. - You're like me? - Yes. This entire place was designed specifically for people like us. So like I said, you're safe. Clean clothes for you, a towel. Bathroom's right around the corner. Okay? - What's gonna happen to me? - Nothing you need to worry about. Clean yourself up. We'll talk after. When's the last time you ate? - I'm not hungry. - Most psionics I detect young, at five or six. But here you are in your teens, and I know nothing about you. Maybe we can start with a name. - Aurora. - Ah, Aurora. It's very nice to meet you, Aurora. I'm Derek. I'm very sorry about what happened to your friend. How often have you replayed it in your head? - It won't stop. He was... He was my only friend. And he was nice to me. And I... I didn't mean to. I didn't mean to. And I... I couldn't control it. - The surge is what we call it. It's how I found you. That power... it'll pull you in and make you lose control if you don't know how to resist it. - I'm done using them. - Oh, no. No. All you need is proper training. - Training, that's what... That's what you do here? - It is. And I can already tell that you're exceptional because throughout this entire conversation, you've managed to keep me out of your head. And that's... Who are your parents, Aurora? Who do you... Who do you live with? - No one. I-I-I ran away. - Is there anyone you'd like me to call? Anyone at all? No? Well, it's getting late. I'm gonna have one of the attendants show you to your room if you would, in fact, like to stay here, and I hope you do. There are some kids here around your age I'd like to introduce you to at some point. Yeah? - What about... What about what I did to Isaiah? - Yeah. I'll take care of it. Okay. This is Gloria. Don't mind the contraption on her face. All of our attendants are non-psionic. They wear those to keep the rest of us out of their heads. She'll get you settled. - You ready? Bathroom is through that door. If you need anything else, let us know. We're glad you're here. - Morning. Did you get some sleep? - A little. - Did you eat? - A little. - Aurora, what happened wasn't your fault. These abilities, they're complicated. They're transformative. And, as you've seen, they can be dangerous. Can I ask you about your abilities? Not all of us possess... Or I should say can access the same ones. - What do you wanna know? - Well, I already know you can read minds because you've been trying to get inside mine since we met. It's okay. I'd be doing the same thing if I was in your shoes. But can you move objects? - I'm not good at it. Not if it's heavy. - Foresight? - I like to do projections. - Really? Well, young lady, I'm very interested to find out what else you can do, given the right focus, the right opportunity. - How can you teleport? - Ooh. With an immense amount of focus, control, will. It rivals astral projection in terms of the energy required. - I don't know what that is. - Astral projection? Oh, it's... it's pretty cool. You project your own form, your... your presence, away from your physical body. It's like being in two places at once. Incredibly taxing physically and very difficult to master. - Can you do it? Not well. Let's take a walk. Come on. So how you feeling about this place? - You said there were other kids here my age? Mm-hmm, that's right. - When do I get to meet them? - Well, most are in class at the moment. Education's a priority here. But if you'd like, you can start taking your meals in the dining hall with them this evening. Is that good? - Okay. - Do you know how memory works, Aurora? And I don't mean in a brain chemical sense. I mean in the dream, Freudian, associative sense. - No. - Well, for example, if I say to you, "Who do you live with?" it sparks a memory in you. I'm gonna put all my cards on the table here. I know that you weren't honest with me when I asked who you live with. It's okay. Why would you be? Can I show you something? - What... what is this? Where are we? - We're in your memory. - Where are you going? - I told you, I quit! - You can't quit! We're a team! Two peas in a pod! - Ugh! Those are gonna be black-eyed peas if you don't get out of my way! - What you thought of when I asked you where you live. You like sitcoms? What about my dead cat? - And "The Metaphysics of Morals." Interesting. Uh-huh. What am I supposed to buy here? That you live in this paradise of philosophy and potato chips all by yourself? - You don't need to buy it. It's true. - This girl here got all these books, all this food, this TV. - I love that TV. I meant it when I said you're exceptional. You're actively manipulating this memory in real time, aren't you? Mm. As we stand here in this memory of yours, you've been reading page 45, and yet, the page is always the same. - Well, what about, um... Both: What about my dead cat? - I've heard that punchline three times now. You live here with someone. And they're somewhere in this memory with you. Based on your visual clues, whoever it is you're hiding comes in through there. - Why does it matter? - It only matters because you think it's important enough to lie about. - It's not important. - I'm gonna say some words... and see which ones trigger the right memories. Father. Mother. What does she look like? - Mm. You say you hate what we read, and yet you love that garbage? That's good. That's very good. But what does your mother really look like? - You say you hate what we read, and yet... - Aurora. What does she say to you in this moment? - Nothing. - What's her voice sound like? That photo on the wall. Ayla. - You know her? - I did. You shouldn't be protecting her. - What is this? - Your mother murdered these three people. - What? She wouldn't... She wouldn't do this. - I wish that were true. You shouldn't have to find out this way. I'm sorry. - She wouldn't do this. - Has she ever allowed you to get in her mind? Ever wonder why? These officers were just doing their job. Both of them had families, children. This third man there, he was our friend. - Stop. - I take it you guys moved around a lot. Well, now, you know why. Aurora, you understand what I'm offering you here, right? Freedom, an opportunity to belong, to have friends that are like you. Help us find your mother. - I can't. - You can't or won't? - She's my mom. - I know what I'm asking, and I know it's hard. Your mother and I were friends once. I thought we shared a vision for a future where psionics could be happy and safe. She chose a different path. - I wanna leave. - Well, I can't let you do that. Not while she's still out there. Come. Joseph's gonna show you back to your room. I'm gonna give you three seconds to get on the ground. Three... Two... one... Oh, shit! Hey, hey! No, stop! - Ayla! What the hell happened? Who's that? - Look at this picture of domestic tranquility. - Uh, it's... It's great, isn't it? I don't trust it. - Oh, hi, Mom. I didn't even see you guys come in. - Uh-huh. - Yeah. How was it? - Oh, it was marvelous. The music, the set decoration. - What the hell? - Security breach, East Wing, Sector 426. Security breach, East Wing, Sector 426. Security breach, East Wing, Sector 426. - Let's go! Help! You're not real. None of this is real, none of this is real, none of this is real. Run, run! Go get help! Get help! I need some help. I don't wanna be here anymore. Please, please. Get me outta here. Help me out. Come on. Get me outta here. - I'll kill you. - Hey. Hey. Hey, I'm here. Hey. Hey, come here. - I thought we were making progress. - What the hell is this place, really? - How did you get out of your room? Unless you can teleport, those locks require 1,500 pounds of force. - What is this place? - What's a human without a conscience? - What? - What is a human without a conscience? Dangerous. So what's a psionic without a conscience? What happens when a psionic decides to use their powers in a way that goes against the basic principles that govern moral conduct? Who would be able to stop them? When enough people think something is dangerous, they'll work to make a law forbidding it, and they will punish those who break that law! - What law? - Not the kind written in books. - And the people in those cells, they're psionics? - Yes. - What did they do? - Exist. - Exist? That's it? - Psionics are too dangerous to live free in the world. To borrow a phrase from your readings, it's a utilitarian decision. The best outcome for the most people. I find them and bring them here, and I take care of them. - But you're a psionic. - It's called self-preservation. If it wasn't me, it would be someone else. 20 years ago, they recruited me to track down psionics who were using their powers in ways that were unethical. Can't put 'em in jail, so an idea was proposed. We build this facility, find psionics to run it. I tried to help your mother! Offered her the chance to run it with me. Compromise... not her strongest trait. - You lied to me. - No. - Everything you said about... About this place, about helping me was all bullshit! - No. Each of those people, they're living inside their projections, living in their own memories, their own fantasies. They're happy! - That's not living! - They have no consequence for their decisions, no chance to hurt anyone. And that's the whole truth! Now, where's Ayla? Where's Ayla? Where's Ayla? Ayla! Ayla! Ayla! What did she tell you to do if you get caught? No? - I tell them nothing. - What do you show them? - Nothing. - What happens if they go into your memories? - I forget. - Forget what? - As much as I can. - How? - Think of anything else. - Use an anchor memory. - An anchor memory. Right, yeah. - Oh, there's that Ayla fire. By using this memory as a shield, you give yourself away. This represents what you most wanted your life to be like. - Get out of my head. Well, this isn't gonna work. - What are you... Stop! Get off me! - This could have been easy. Whatever happens now, you chose it. - What are you... what... What are... what are you... No, no, no, no! - The more you fight, the more it hurts. Hello? - Hi. What's wrong? - No. You're not real. - Sure, I am. Feels real. Right? - Stop. - Why? What's wrong? It's just us. Like you always wanted. - No. Why are you doing this to me? No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, No, no, no, no, no, no! - Help me, Aurora. - You're okay! You're okay, you're okay, you're okay, you're okay, you're okay. I'm... I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm... I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. What? - Ro, you gonna get that? - Mom? That's your date, Ro. You better open it! - Hi. Wow, you look amazing. Um... - Oh, Ro! Did you go and kill your boyfriend? Again? But then again, what can you expect from someone so... ♪ Weak? ♪ Uh, there goes another one. Try to keep from... pew, pew, pew! Killing this one. There's only one way to stop it, though. Tell us where she is. Tell us where she is. Tell us where she is. Hello, Aurora. - Why don't you join us? We have a seat for you right here. - Just join us. This is what you wanted, right? Together: Friends? - Let me out! - Aurora. That's a cool name. - Isaiah... I'm so sorry. I couldn't control it, and I didn't mean to. - It'll be okay, Ro. Just tell us. Just tell us. - Please. - Just tell us! - Aurora! What did you do? - Mom? - You never listen! - You... you're not real. - You left the house when I told you... I told you not to! But I knew you were weak. Didn't I tell you? You are weak! - Mom, please. - And I was right. You killed that boy! - Stop! - That's on you! You are my one regret! - Please, please just leave me alone. Please just... - Come on, Ro, let's go! We got shit to do! You are weak! You are small! You are nothing but a disappointment! Tell us. Take away the guilt. We'll make you strong. Tell us. Tell us. Aurora! Please, just stop. - Tell us. You are weak! You are nothing! Tell us. Aurora, tell us. Tell us. Aurora! Ro. It's okay, Ro. You can tell them. I'm here. - Okay. - What happens if they go into your memories? - I forget. - Forget what? - As much as I can. - How? - Think of anything else. - Use an anchor memory. - An anchor memory, yeah, I know. - And you fight. You fight as long and as hard as you can. And where will I be? - Bus stop on the 730 line off of Route 80, exit 3. - That's right. What are you gonna do when you catch her? - ♪ Right up till now ♪ ♪ You didn't care ♪ - Hi, honey. Just making some dinner. - Mom? The one and only. Isaiah will be here soon. You better get washed up. Here, this will make you feel better. - This isn't real. This is the life you wanted. Why fight it? - Ayla! - What did you do to her? - Oh, it's good to see you too. - You know I'm gon' kill you, right? - Well, you're skipping the pleasantries. Well, at least you're consistent. Well, your daughter and I have been having some, uh, insightful conversations. - I know you did. - Nobody wants unsolicited parenting advice... But, Jesus, Ayla, you have fucked that kid up. - I did what I needed to do to keep her away from you. - Yeah? How's that going? See, this is why I'm not a parent. 'Cause kids just don't listen, do they? But then again, nobody listens. - Let her go. Take me. - Why? Why would I do that? - Hope. - Hope? Oh, gee, Ayla, that's ironic. I mean, uh... We both hoped for a better world. The difference is... I created one. - Where is she? - Oh, you know where she is. And you know how this ends. We had a good thing, Ayla. We really did. I miss it, I confess. I offered you a way out. - What, by working for you? - By working beside me. - In that rotten hell hole you are so proud of? - I could have killed you that night. - Why didn't you? - I-I wasn't ready to kill my friend. - You talk about me being consistent? But you, you are consistent. You are a coward. You've always been a coward! And instead of fighting them, you became their errand boy. - I promoted the greater good. - Wake up! - I am awake. What you want would lead to war. The whole world against psionics. That's not a fight we're gonna win. - You don't know that. There are other ways. You need to wake up now. Look at me. - Mom? Are you... is this real? - Yes, this is real. - What did you say? - Goodbye, Derek. - Lock this place down. Ayla! - No, no, no, no! Ayla. I know you're in the building. - Shut your mind, Ro. Come on. - Ayla! Ayla? So close! - Remember astral projections? Your mama here just put on a clinic. - Oh, but she refuses to see the necessity of what I do here! - Stop, stop! - It didn't need to come to this, Ayla. It didn't need to end like this! But your idea of freedom, it only works when paired with duty! - Stop! - The world is safer and better because of me! Oh, but you never believed in absolutes. That was the problem. - Ro. Trust your power. - I said... stop! - Are you okay? - Mom. Where... where are we, Ro? - The only place I could think of. The farm. Back in Missouri. - How did you do that? I don't know, I don't know. I just... I just... I... I knew I had to be the strong one for once, and... And I stopped being afraid of disappointing you. - We need to go. - You knew I'd break. You knew I'd tell them about the bus stop. - I had to figure out a way to make your weakness into an asset. Wow. - That's not what I meant. You should have never left the house that night. - Are you serious right now? I know what you did. The murders. Mom, I need you to start telling me the truth. No more lies or I am getting out of this car. - What do you wanna know? - Everything. Tell me everything. - My mind is open. It's all there. - Where are we? - Where you just were. - Ayla! - His facility 15 years ago. I'm done talking. - This won't stop anything! - You were trying to stop him. - It was supposed to be a place to help dangerous psionics, and then he started going after all of us. Even the ones who had done nothing wrong. You were just a baby. I couldn't have you end up here. - Go. Run! Run! Run! - Patrolling officer in pursuit. Hey! - Hey! Stop! Stop! - If she takes one more step, I'm gonna pull the trigger. That's what you're thinking, right? You, not so much. Now, you are. - Fuck! - Oh, shit! Hey, hey! Don't! Stop! - Ayla! What the hell happened? - Talk to me. Ugh! Why... why did you do that? - To illustrate a point. Psionics are dangerous, huh? - He was our friend! - No, he was your friend. Like you, he was in the way. When people ask what happened here, I'm gonna tell them exactly who's responsible for it. - You're crazy! I didn't kill them! - Five people know what happened in this room. Three of them are dead. And let's not forget you just tried to blow a hole in the side of my building. I've been running so long... I don't know how to stop. - Why didn't you just tell me? You didn't have to shut me out. And my whole life, you made me feel like... Like I did something wrong. And I know you think I'm weak, but I could have helped. I can help. - Look, I was only trying to protect you. How did that turn out? I killed my only friend. - I'm sorry. For all of it. Aurora, please. Look at me. You are not weak. I never thought you were weak. It's just... I didn't want you to see my pain. I was the weak one. - I'm not going back to living the way we were. - I was thinking when we're done here, we should head north. I was thinking of Portland. - Maine? - Oregon. - Oregon. - I know some people there. It's a great city. He's gonna keep coming after us, Ro. It... it'll be different this time. I don't know another way, Ro. You've gotten very good at it. Keeping me out of your head. - I'm not gonna keep running. - Why did you do that? So he knows where we are. - Hi. - Goddammit, Ro! - We need to talk. - Yeah. Lifetime of running and hiding no longer seems so appealing, does it? - Not so much, no. Yeah. That was real impressive. What you did back there, the teleporting. There's a world where you and I could work together. - Ro. - Work together how? - Succession. - That come with a pension? - Well, it comes with stability. And, uh, autonomy. I'm not gonna live forever. Someone needs to take over when I'm gone. And you need a teacher, Ro. - Yeah, no, that doesn't... That doesn't work for me. And don't call me Ro. - Okay. - I want you to let us go. - Let you go where? - Just leave us alone. Or? - Ro, we need to go. - Just trust me. So what is it? What are we doing? - I think you know. - You are not weak. - We have a choice how we use these powers. That's what you said. He wasn't gonna stop.
