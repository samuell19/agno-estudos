Come, come! This ghost town... This godforsaken place is where I grew up. People around here used to know me well. They respected me. But most of them are afraid of me including myself. Right now, they seem to have settled down. They're letting the curse of this place roll off their back. But it's only a matter of time until the disaster strikes them. Because of family, I decided to return. Otherwise, I won't be wasting my time around here, going back to my old wretched self. Stop right there! Don't turn around! Where are you from, sir? Machang. Show me your ID. This MyTentera card here says you're a local. That's my dad's place. What are you back here for? Family matter. All right. You may turn around now. Slowly. You were trying to goof around, weren't you? Hassan Munas, you are still alive. Watch out! You can't smoke here. Relax, there is nobody here. It's fine here, just smoke. You're smoking a smuggled cigarette, no less. Do you want me to cuff you up here? Since you've become Inspector Boon, you're not willing to share a cigarette with an average Joe like me. An average Joe? You are a commando. A retired commando. Here's what I'm curious about. How could a rascal like you become a cop? Just like that. The same way you got me to join your cause. That's how you'll be covering me. In other words, if it wasn't for you, I wouldn't be a rascal. But thanks to you, not only an inspector, I couldn't even get into the police academy. Even if you want to be some henchman, don't drag your dad into this. Hey, Mr. Inspector. It's your work. Why me? If someone creates a ruckus like this, you used to beat them up. Why do you think I left this place? I want to make a change. Hey, do something. It's annoying. Why should I butt in? Since they want to fight, let them. Knock each other down harder until both lay flat on the ground. It makes my job easier. Jeez. Hassan, when I look at these two, I can't help but remember your old days. How is it? Don't you feel odd sitting in the front seat of a police car? Sir, are you Hassan Munas? Wow, you're famous. Seriously? The undefeated Hassan Munas? Hassan Munas, the invincible boxer? Wait, are you here to go back to ring? You want to avenge your sister, don't you? It's none of my business! You got the wrong person. Are you sure, Hassan? It was all because of you! Shut up! Hassan, Hassan Munas! Hassan? Can we take a selfie? I can just tell you what happened. But it's better if you see it for yourself. See what really happened. Thank you, Boon. It's no big deal. Buy me a drink. No, not that. Thank you for looking after them while I was away. What are friends for? See you. Hassan. Is your sister still single? Say it again and I'll knock you down! With your dorky hair, you want my sister? Please! Bye. Hey, bastard! Hello! Hello... Hassan. Not only did they throw paint, they broke our windows too. Are you looking at the flower or machete? Neither seem right. Your late mom really hated that machete. She asked me to bring it down from the wall for years, but I didn't do it. Not until she passed away. So you decided to put it as decoration for mom's pot? Do you think that's not suitable? It looks fine to me. Dad, I'm off to work. Have you talked to her? You're coming back to sort out her problem, aren't you? You do know, right? I spent the last two years at Machang camp. Did you visit your grandma's grave? Dad. I have some savings. Together with some pension money, I plan to buy a house. The houses here are expensive. Let's buy a house there. That's great, whatever you think best. Dad, come with me. Zain too. Let's settle down there, Dad. You don't have to work at the factory anymore. And then, Zain can... She can get away from her trouble, just like you. Is that what you're saying? Things are different now, Hassan. Raja should be the one leaving, not us. I thought you hated that factory. Mom was treated disrespectfully because she didn't want to work there. They insulted me. Because I worked for Raja. Now it's you. I don't think you understand. True. Just like how Mom didn't understand, so do I. Nobody understands. Nothing seems right. It's not your fault, isn't it? Dad, please think about it. I saw a pretty hot lady just now. Hey. Is Raja around? Jeez, who's this guy? Nazmi. Hassan. Jal. Yes, Nazmi. Did your mom know you're working here? Of course, she knows. Following my idol's steps. You should learn from my mistakes. Don't be an idiot like me. Hey, just mind your own business! Your skank sister is even worse. My sister is a skank? You heard me. Is she too dumb to mess up with Raja? Nazmi. How about your sister, Najwa? It's been a while since I'm back here. So, I need to catch up. Please don't be mad if I ask this. Is it true that she's dead? Drug overdose? I got it right, may she rest in peace. Just like what people say. Don't be a junkie. Such a waste of a good life. Ifrit. It's been a while. Wow, "Lambor-bikini"! I didn't expect you're still working here. That's a long time. Didn't Raja provide you with a pension scheme? It's not funny, is it? Nazmi. What if one day Hassan meets Ifrit in the ring? Who do you think would win? It's the battle between a legendary fighter and Mr. Raja's mysterious chief of security. Who would win? Hassan. Hassan? Raja. Hassan Munas. It's been a while. It's all right, it won't take long. A retired lieutenant, Raja. Drop the formality. Just call me Raja. Well, retired lieutenant. Raja. I come with a humble request. Could you please leave my sister and dad alone? Yes, I understand about the debt. I'll find a way to clear the debt. I just hope that you could be patient and please leave them alone, that's all. Hassan. Take a seat, Hassan. Hassan. Yes, I understand. About your sister and your dad. They are not like you. And we both made a lot of money. Both of you could see the opportunity I was giving to the community. She's more like your dad. Ungrateful! She announced to everyone that she was going to humiliate and I quote, "This uncrowned king's illegitimate child." So, if Zain brings you here... No, she didn't. If Zain brings you here, you'd better ask her where her courage and hubris were from the other day. But I don't have a beef with you. Thank you, Raja. Ifrit. It's one-way here. The exit is over there. Hold on. Before Nazmi cues you guys to thrash me, hear me out. Nazmi, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have made that joke about your sister. I think it's better if you stop this plan to thrash me up. What are you talking about, punk? What cue are you talking about? You know, the cue during film shooting like, "Action! Cut!" Or you want to yell, "Go, go, go"? I know you will yell, "Attack!", am I right? Enough! Shut your mouth and just walk out. Or you want to go with, "Charge!"? It sounds like a war movie. I'm just joking though. Charge! Get him! Get him! -Hey, get him! -Get him! I'm really sorry about your sister. I shouldn't have said that. She was also a victim. Don't be like us. You still can walk away from this. I'm really sorry. I'm home. Is the electricity their doing too? Where's Dad? Zain! I know you're mad at me, but you shouldn't... You're no longer mad at me, right, Zain? It's almost eight years. I bet you went to see Raja, right? I knew it. Nobody walked out from Raja's office without these bruises. It's not because of Raja. His underlings seemed to have some problems with me. -Yeah, right! -Zain, wait! It hurts, you punk! -Right? -I'm going to get you. Serves you right! Why did you knee-strike me? It was long overdue. Who taught you to kick people like this? It's not you for sure. You weren't here to teach me. I know you're mad at me. I never thought that I would be away that long. And suddenly, I ended up at Sungai Udang Camp. I became a commando. Zain. I think we still have a chance to talk it out with Raja. Let's follow me to see him tomorrow. After all of this is, I want you and Dad to come with me to Machang. Do you want us to run away? I saw it with my own eyes. What's so special about this place? The world out there is so much better than this place. I just ask for one thing. Could you and Dad set your egos aside? That's all I'm asking. This has nothing to do with ego. What? Do you think you can come out of nowhere and take us away with you so that all our problems disappear? Listen, Zain. I don't believe at all that you've changed since you've been in the army. The so-called protector of the country. You can't even protect your own family. What do you think I'm doing right now? Is this your idea of protection? What I'm hearing from you right now is just running away from the problem. That's all you know! Zain! Damn it! This place is as hot as hell. Are you expecting an air-conditioned room, Alvin? That fan is almost the same age as my kid. It's not working well. Jeez. We can bring this to the labor court! Labor court is useless! Hey! What's the matter? Can't you talk nicely? Why are you doing this? You always go around throwing a fit. Hey, do you think that Raja will trust us or you? Hey, stop! They are not worth it. You do know who sent them, right? Hey, you rascal! This is coming out of your salary! Hey, your daughter is getting hotter! I HAD BEEN GUARANTEED MEDIA PROTECTION I have found it. Uncle Hamid. Hey. A pack of cigarettes, please. Hassan! Boon! Your hand is looking good. Is that a new tattoo? Just like David Beckham. Tattoo, my ass. Did you know? Last night, my sister knee-stroked my face. I thought we're friends. You should have asked me along. I would love to see Raja behind bars. You went there alone, for sure you come back in a mess. I didn't say anything about putting Raja behind bars. Why? Are you worried about what they think of you? Did you see that? I'm not the only one who heard about your little agenda from yesterday. And after that, they saw you talking to a cop this morning. Do you think they are going to sit there quietly? They are bothered for sure because they don't even like you. That's what I'm curious about. I just want to help them. You all should be happy if I could get Raja. Stupid! Maybe they've lived too long under Raja and couldn't imagine life without him. So, they've been hiding his dirty work. My job to sweep them all up gets tougher. Good luck with your "sweeping" job. Hassan, don't be like them. Let's join forces. We have the same goal. How did the negotiation with the "Rogue Raja" go? You're still laughing? He's your boss too. This is what happens if you still insist to stay here. You are still on this. Dad, can you please persuade Zain to come with me to meet Raja tonight? Let's apologize to Raja. Who knows Raja might take the load off of Zain? Then, we can leave this place together. We? Do you mean all of us? We're here because Raja tore down our house. We live in a slum and on an illegal land! The land that he bought, at that. He gave us this flat and jobs to everyone, Dad. You thought the godforsaken job in the factory as a gift? We are working for twenty hours a day, seven days a week. They paid us peanut and you call it a gift? Raja pushed us to the corner and left us with no choice. If you think you're so smart, why did you accept it in the first place? Over my dead body! This place has screwed me up eight years ago, Dad. Remember what happened yesterday? What's next? Will they screw up Zain too? Jeez. You sound just like your late mom. Do you remember that? Do you? -When she talked back to me-- -I do! Vividly. That's why she couldn't stand a second being with you. But it's not because of this place. It's a good thing Mom is dead. I bet she would be upset, seeing how your stubbornness has ruined Zain, his daughter. Damn it! Hassan. Zain, hurry up! Shut up! I only come with you because of Dad. Relax! Soon, we don't have to face Raja anymore. Do you think Raja would listen to you? We'll be lucky to get out alive. Do you think Raja will kill us? How would I know? I thought he's your ex-boss. Hey. We live in a lawful country. We know how Raja is, so don't poke the bear. I wouldn't want to do that. I just want to save my family, that's all. See what he has to say. I got this. Boss. Raja. Yes, there is. I... I. I... I'm sorry. I'm sorry because I was being ungrateful for what you have been giving us. In the meantime, I hope your dad knows that I was just trying to help. But that won't do it. What are you talking about? Eat. Do it! Are you letting this happen? I just want to get this over with, Zain. Damn it. You'd better help me clean it up. That clears 40 percent of what you owe me. Say hi to your dad. Hassan, Zain. How would both of you like the chance to clear hundred percent of your debt in the ring? Raja, we... I don't know, Zain. I think we don't have to fight. You threw me in the dirt. Now I'm asking for your payback. We still have time not to go with this. I thought you want this to be over. You want me and Dad to go back to Machang with you, right? If we win this, we can leave the flat. We'll be free. So now, are you coming with me? If we win, I'll talk it out with Dad. What if we lose? I've seen Vee's brother in action. He's really strong, but he always hesitates. But if you're truly the brother that I used to know, you have nothing to worry about. What about Vee? About Vee, I'll take care of it. I know how to teach that bitch a lesson. Enough. Hooray! Who has the guts to challenge us? Come on, Hassan! You could be more excited. So, are you coming back to Machang with me? Okay. I'll talk to Dad. He'll listen to me. You're no longer mad at me, are you? You know how happy I am seeing you go back into the ring? When I was a kid, whenever you had a fight, I'd sneak out of the house to see you fight. I never missed an opportunity. I've been screaming out your name. I know. In the ring, you're different. You're strong. You're fearless. I wanted to be just like you. But I think right now, you're even bolder than me. That's not the point, Hassan. Okay, what's the point? Just tell me. I remember back then, when Mom and Dad were arguing, you would hide me. When we got caught, you always made sure to step up as long as I got away with it. But one day, you were no longer there. You disappeared. You left me just like that. My life took a turn for the worse. It was miserable. I started to join the ring. I thought I wanted to be just like you. Let me tell you the truth, Zain. When I left, I despised myself. Back then, all I knew was picking fights. That was all I did, Zain. Then when I got back home, Mom and Dad were arguing. It got on my nerves. You know I have my temper. I was afraid I would hurt them. I could have hurt you too. I got into the ring so I could feed my temper. But it got worse from there. Until I got into the army. They taught me disciplines. Because of that, I turned out better. I got that. But what I didn't get is how you just decided to leave me behind to face all of this on my own. I promise you, I'll never leave you again. Until you're married, of course. Then you can go with your husband. You're no longer my problem. We're going to Kelantan. Do you think there will be guys who would fall for a girl like me? No one will. You're rough around the edges. Do you have a death wish? Do you think no one would like me? Damn you! Zain. Six o'clock, someone is tailing us. Don't look! You don't have to look. Are those your friends? No. Run! Hassan! Vee, stop this! We've made a deal with your dad. Zain! Rayyan! Rayyan! Zain! Hassan, wake up! Wake up, Hassan! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Get up, Hassan! We have to leave now! Let's go! Here. Boss, Munas' kids weren't on the bus. Alert all our guys at the flat. Let's move to Flat Raja Merah now, quick! Let's go. Dad is not answering. Hurry up, Zain! Hey! Move! Here! Move! Nazmi, let's go! Yes. Dad! Dad, get out of the house. Something bad happened! Raja must have sent his men to look for us there. He's coming! Dad, leave now! You can still make it! Even so, where else I could go? Dad! Stubborn old man! Wait here. There you are. You didn't ask when you tore down my house before. Where are your kids? I don't know, I chased them away. They won't be back here. But tonight... Since you will die anyway, I should tell you now. Raja. You can continue to tyrannize the innocents here. But when they have had enough, when the day has come, they'll retaliate. When that day comes, you'll regret causing all of this mess. I'd like to report an emergency. Because when the oppressed start to retaliate, the aftermath will be beyond your grasp. I should have ended you a long time ago. Get inside! God the Almighty! Dad! Move aside! Zain! Hassan! -The fire is out of control! -No, Dad! It's too late! -Dad! -It's dangerous! Do you get it? Stop! Zain! Dad! Enough! Zain, listen to me! Dad is gone, Zain. Zain! You have no right to hold my dad's machete! Hey! They are back! Get in! Attack! Charge! Hurry up! Zain! Where are you going? I'm going to look for Raja. Let me end him. Even if I have to die with him, I don't care anymore! -Please don't be stupid! -I'm stupid? You're stupid! This is all because of you! You never cared for us! You never cared to come home and bury mom! And now you've paid for that! Deal with it yourself! But this is not the right time for us to come for Raja, understand? They are here! Hurry up! Damn it! -Stop this instant! -Hey! Hassan, put down the machete. They burned my dad alive. Put down the machete. All of this is no one's fault, but yours. It was because of you. Blame no one but you. All of you! You're enjoying your lives as slaves, right? This is what happens to slaves! Today, Munas paid the price. Who will next? Hassan, please tell me what really happened. We found a bus. There was an accident. The body of Raja's kid was also in there. But when I got there, I didn't find the body. Do you know anything about that? You don't get this. What did you say? I don't get this? You're the one who didn't get it, Hassan. You know what? I'm just like you. I want to get away from this place, you know? My parents passed away because they overworked. Do you know what happened then? After that, I worked day and night hoping to get that rogue. Why do you think I keep going until now? That's because when I look at your family, it's the same as the others. They are still stuck in the flat. I saw my parents' fate. They are just waiting. You're right, Boon. We want the same thing. I'm not running away this time. What I want now is to end Raja. I think Zain is looking for Raja now. Look for her and ask her to come back. Then, you create a ruckus at the factory. We know that he's making more than just condoms in there. Okay, listen to me. In the dipping room, there's a room at the right side of the hall towards the end. That room is guarded by Raja's private security guard. Give a reason for us to enter that room. Hold on. How did you know all this stuff? Who do you think? I don't get it. Get it now? Punch me! What? Punch me! Aim for the nose ridge. Make sure I'm bleeding. Seriously? Absolutely. Hit me! Sorry, Boon. I think there is no need. Hurry up! Take this! Ouch! Why did you punch me? Move, quickly! Stop! Just go. Is everything good today? Is there any problem? -Have you checked? -Yes. Okay. Hey! What are you doing here? Hey! Where to? Get back to work! Hey! Is this Munas' hot daughter? No idea. Hey, just go. She's just a petite lady. You first. Go! You're bigger. I'm falling! I'm sorry! Just go! Zain. Hassan. Hey, are you all right? I'm good. Move aside. How? Do you still dare? Come on. Whose phone is that? Just answer it! Darn ringtone! Exactly! Whose phone is that? This is embarrassing. Hello, Nazmi. Faizal! Come back here. Your mom is worried sick! Hey, how long do you want to be under Raja who treats us like dirt? That's enough, come back now! Honey, please come back home. Raja has killed Munas. We have to think about the kids. Honey! Where are you? I miss you. Hey! I have five missed calls. They're from my mom and dad. With pleasure, boss. Come with me! Where are you taking me? I'm not running away! So am I. Hey, get out of here! Hey! Go! Go! Hassan, what is this? Get out! Get out! It's meth. I knew it. How did you know about this place? Dad. Let's burn it. Let's burn the whole place! Zain! Hassan! Zain! Run! It's dangerous! Hurry up! What's the matter? Boon will take care of this. If we want to get Raja, we have to hurry. Let's go. Hassan! Zain! You scumbag! That one is sharp. Zain. Are you okay? Wait outside, Zain. No way, we're in this together! Wait here. -Hassan! -Can you please listen to me? They've trained me. I know how to handle this. I only have you, Zain. I won't be able to forgive myself if anything happens to you. So, wait outside. Understand? Your kid is dead. Do you still have something to live for? You of all people should understand. I'm sincere. And who else from the community is worthy of sharing all these with me? Drop the bullshit. You are treacherous and a snake! You are the fake king! The worse of all kinds! You killed my dad, Raja! You know what? As long as you're still alive, people are going to bow to you. Looks like you don't know me after all. Hassan! We should have just followed you back when you asked us to go to Machang. If we listened to you, none of this would happen. Zain. You're right. It's all my fault. The cops bust this place because the factory caught fire. After this, Raja will go to jail and everyone will be free from him. What about you? This is long overdue. Someone should have stood up to Raja and brought him to justice. If anyone should go to jail for all of that, it should be me, Zain. But just me. Not with you. If you're going to jail with me, my aim to return and save our family will be meaningless. It will be in vain. Take care, Zain. Tuan. Is he dead? If he's dead, why in the world would I drag him? You're right! Boon, whatever they say, my sister has nothing to do with this. -Can I count on you? -Sure. Come on. Why? Where are we going? It's about to blow up, so hurry up. Hassan! -Hassan! -All hail to our hero! -All hail to our hero! -Hassan! -All hail to our hero! -Hassan! -All hail to our hero! -Hassan! Why are you smiling? Do you like being a hero? No. I just hope my dad would be proud. -All hail to our hero! -Hassan! -All hail to our hero! -Hassan! Zain. The army taught me about discipline and made me a better person. Be safe. SPC Oil Power Plant continues its operation a year after the tragedy where 62 workers were being held hostage. They were defeated by the PASKAL team. The attempt to hijack the oil rig was led by Rudy Pajor who was gunned down while trying to flee into open waters. THE END
