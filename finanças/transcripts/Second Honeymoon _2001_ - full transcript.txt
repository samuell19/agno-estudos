THERE WAS A GIVEAWAY AT THE CAR WASH AND IT CAME WITH A FREE CAN OF WAX. NOW, NOW, HE MAY PINCH A PENNY OR TWO, BUT YOU TWO HAVE A LOT TO SHOW FOR THE PAST 20 YEARS. WHAT ABOUT THE NEXT 20 YEARS? MOMMY, THERE'S SOMETHING I NEED TO TALK TO YOU-- BUT THEY COULD BE THE BEST YEARS OF ALL. AFTER YOU GOT MARRIED AND SEAN SETTLED IN BOSTON, THAT'S WHEN YOUR FATHER AND I TOOK UP THE TANGO. [CLICKS TONGUE] OH! GEORGE WON'T EVEN BRING ME A ROSE. WHAT MAKES YOU THINK HE'LL WEAR ONE BETWEEN HIS TEETH? SHOWTIME. SHE WAS JUST 18, A YOUNG IRISH LASS ALL ALONE IN AMERICA.

THAT WAS A FIRE ESCAPE. WELL, THEY COULD BARBECUE. [LAUGHTER] IT RAINED THE FIRST FEW MONTHS WE WERE THERE. [LAUGHS] IT WAS LIKE AN OLD FRIEND COME TO VISIT. FELT LIKE I WAS BACK IN IRELAND. - OH, DARLING. - A YEAR LATER, BRIDGET WESTON WAS BORN. [THUNDER] [BABY CRYING] NOT WASTING ANY TIME, KEVIN WESTON, HEIR TO THE THRONE, ARRIVED 10 MONTHS LATER. WHY AM I THE ALIEN AND YOU GET FIREWORKS, KEVIN? - IT'S HIS MOVIE. - HA HA! LIKE COLUMBIA RIVER SALMON, THE WESTONS' LIFE WAS UPSTREAM, BUT THEY NEVER LET IT GET THEM DOWN. GEORGE GOT A JOB AT THE BANK... [BELLS RINGING] [CASH REGISTER BELL RINGS] AND SOON THEY COULD AFFORD MORE THAN A LUMP OF COAL IN THEIR STOCKINGS AT CHRISTMAS. - YAY! - LOOK AT THAT. GEORGE HAD A PAPER ROUTE BY THE TIME HE WAS 9. A MORNING AND EVENING ROUTE. - PLEASE. - YES. THE YEARS WENT BY. MAGGIE'S GARDEN GREW AND SO DID GEORGE'S JOB AT THE BANK. HE BECAME A LOAN OFFICER.

I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE CAN'T JUST TELL EVERYBODY THAT WE'RE SEPARATING AND GET A REFUND. BECAUSE IT'S NON-REFUNDABLE. REMEMBER? YEAH, BUT YOU KNOW, WE COULD AFFORD TO GO ANYWHERE WE WANT TO, ANYTIME WE WANT TO, BUT ALL YOU EVER DO IS WORK. YEAH, WELL... I'M NOT GONNA BE WORKING THE NEXT 5 DAYS. I'M GONNA BE WINDSURFING. THESE KIDS THINK OF EVERYTHING. THEY GOT ME WINDSURFING LESSONS AND YOU SCUBA LESSONS. IT'S JUST THAT A HONEYMOON IS MEANT TO BE ROMANTIC. DON'T START ON OUR SEX LIFE, MAGGIE. WHAT SEX LIFE, GEORGE? WE DON'T HAVE A SEX LIFE. THERE YOU GO. LOOK, WAIT A MINUTE. IF WE GO TO MANZANILLA, NOBODY HAS TO KNOW WHAT WE DO ONCE WE GET THERE, RIGHT? WHY DON'T WE TAKE SEPARATE VACATIONS?

WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME, GEORGE? I WANT YOU TO STOP PLAYING ISLAND PRINCESS AND GET REAL. I MEAN, GO FIND SOME REAL WOOD, SOME REAL COCONUTS BECAUSE IT'S GONNA BE REALLY, REALLY DARK REAL SOON. I SAW A REAL PIG. OH. WHAT? I SAW A PIG. A WILD PIG? A BOAR? THEY'RE FEROCIOUS. IT DIDN'T LOOK FEROCIOUS. MAGGIE, DO NOT GO BACK TO THAT AREA BECAUSE A WILD BOAR CAN KILL YOU. GEORGE...

WHAT ARE YOU DOING? IT'S COLD. - I'M LEAVING YOU ALONE. - OH, COME ON, MAGGIE. - OH, YOU MAKE ME CRAZY. - LOOK. BE REASONABLE. YOU WON'T LISTEN TO OUR THERAPIST. YOU WON'T MARK TERRITORY.

[PLATES CLATTER] WE'RE DEVASTATED THAT YOU'RE CUTTING YOUR STAY WITH US SHORT, MS. HAMILTON. MY CAT IS IN RENAL FAILURE. YOU DON'T HAVE A MEDICAL REFUND POLICY, BY ANY CHANCE? GLORIA, I WANT TO LET YOU KNOW THE WESTONS WILL BE BACK THIS AFTERNOON. - YOU'RE KIDDING. - THEY F-- THEY FILED FOR DIVORCE TWO DAYS AGO. CAN I USE YOUR PHONE TO CALL MY VET? ABSOLUTELY. THAT WAS SOME SHOT YOU MADE. DO YOU THINK SO? OH, YOU CONQUERED A WILD BOAR. SUPPOSE I DID, DIDN'T I? I'M SORRY IF I SPOILED YOUR PLAN WITH THE PIG. OH, I'M SORRY I WAS SO SILLY TO GET ANGRY. MAGGIE, WHAT HAPPENED TO US? WE DIDN'T TAKE UP THE TANGO. I THINK WE JUST STOPPED TALKING. MORE IMPORTANTLY, WE STOPPED LISTENING. WE BURIED OURSELVES IN OUR WORK SAVING FOR THAT IMAGINARY RAINY DAY. RAINY DAYS AREN'T IMAGINARY TO ME, MAGGIE. AT THE BANK, I SEE IT RAIN ON PEOPLE ALL THE TIME. WE'RE NOT THOSE PEOPLE, GEORGE. [SIGHS] WHAT TIME IS IT? IT'S A LITTLE AFTER 4:00. HUH. HEH. WE'RE DIVORCED. DIVORCED. WHAT'S THE MATTER? I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW WE ENDED UP HERE, GEORGE. I MEAN, WE HAD SOMETHING, DIDN'T WE? TELL ME WE HAD SOMETHING. WELL, OF COURSE WE DID. YOU WERE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRL I'D EVER MET AND THE MOST DIFFICULT. YOU DROVE ME CRAZY. PROMISE ME THAT YOU WON'T GROW A GOATEE. WHERE DID THAT COME FROM? MEN WHO GET DIVORCES GROW GOATEES, AND THEY BUY SPORTS CARS. HA HA! I PROMISE... AS LONG AS YOU PROMISE ME SOMETHING. WHAT? THAT'S YOU'LL NEVER REMARRY. YOU WON'T EVEN DATE ANOTHER MAN. WELL, THAT'S NOT FAIR. WHO SAID ANYTHING ABOUT BEING FAIR? THAT'S HOW I FEEL. YOU DON'T GET TO FEEL THAT WAY ANYMORE, GEORGE. YOU WANTED A DIVORCE, AND YOU'RE GETTING ONE. YOU KNOW, I'M NOT THE WIDE-EYED 18-YEAR-OLD THAT YOU MARRIED 20 YEARS AGO. I AM THE MOTHER OF YOUR CHILDREN. I RUN A BUSINESS, AND I'M SORRY IF I'M NOT THERE FOR YOU LIKE I USED TO BE, BUT YOU'RE NOT THERE FOR ME, EITHER. I CHANGED. PEOPLE CHANGE. THAT'S LIFE. THEY GROW. YOU HAVE TO GROW, TOO, GEORGE. STOP BEING SO AFRAID. SPEND YOUR MONEY. HAVE SOME FUN. YOU'RE A GOOD MAN. YOU DESERVE A REWARD, BUT SO DO I. YOU KNOW, I'M SORRY IF I GREW UP AND RUINED EVERYTHING. I'M SORRY IF I'M A WOMAN AND NOT A GIRL ANYMORE, BUT IF YOU CAN'T LOVE ME FOR WHO I AM, THEN AT LEAST WISH ME WELL AND SHOW ME SOME RESPECT FOR THE YEARS THAT I LOVED YOU. I LOVED YOU. AH, ROSA, ROSA, ROSA, THERE IS NOTHING LIKE A CLEAR DAY ON MANZANILLA BAY. ROSA, DO NOT LOOK AT ME LIKE A SPANISH INQUISITOR. THE WESTONS NEEDED MY EXPERT INTERVENTION. I KNOW YOU DON'T LIKE IT WHEN I PLAY CUPID, BUT WHEN I MEET A COUPLE THAT NEEDS HELP LIKE THE WESTONS-- BESIDES, I DON'T DO IT VERY OFTEN. I DON'T. BE FAIR NOW. ONE ON EVER DIED ON CORAZON ISLAND. OK. ONE MAN...IN 1962, BUT HE DIED WITH A SMILE ON HIS FACE, YOU MUST REMEMBER. MM, GEORGE... GEORGE... GEORGE? GEORGE? OH! HUH. LOVELY DAY FOR A RESCUE, EH, RAMON? MM-HMM. WELL-- GEORGE? GEORGE? GEORGE? HELLO! HELLO, HELLO, HELLO! ANTONIO, ANTONIO. - MRS. WESTON. MRS. WESTON, AH, I'M DELIGHTED TO SEE YOU. HAVE YOU SEEN GEORGE? - HE'S NOT WITH YOU? - NO. MR. WESTON IS MISSING. GO. I WILL STAY WITH THE LADIES. OK. DON'T WORRY. I HAVE NEVER MISPLACED A TOURIST. ROSA, HORCHATA PARA LA SENORA. WE WERE SLEEPING IN THE CAVE, AND WHEN I WOKE UP, HE WAS GONE. - SHOW ME, PLEASE. - YEAH. IF YOU DON'T MIND MY ASKING, WAS THERE A QUARREL? NO. WELL, YES, BUT-- YOU ARGUED, PERHAPS? PLEASE, JUST FIND HIM. HE MIGHT BE HURT. DON'T WORRY. WE WILL PRAY TO SAINT JUDE FOR HIM. GEORGE IS OUT THERE SOMEWHERE. I CAN'T JUST LEAVE. RAMON IS CALLING THE HELICOPTER. THEY WILL SEARCH INTO THE NIGHT. WE MUST LEAVE BEFORE IT GETS DARK. ONLY IF YOU PROMISE ME YOU'LL FIND HIM. OF COURSE. I PROMISE, BUT NOW PLEASE-- WHERE ON EARTH COULD HE BE? [OINKING] NO, PIG! NO! NOT AGAIN. GET BACK. BACK, BACK, BACK. GO AWAY. AAH! OH! MAGGIE! WHOA! GO. GO. HELP! UH UH UH! OH, MY GOD. OH, GOD. OH... MAGGIE! MAGGIE! OOH! MAGGIE! OH! OUCH! MAGGIE! SO YOU'RE NOT SURE HOW HE FEELS, BUT YOU WANT TO GIVE IT A CHANCE. YOU DON'T WANT TO GET A DIVORCE, AND YOU'RE ON THE PLANE TOMORROW. YES. I THINK SO. I DON'T EXPECT YOU TO UNDERSTAND. YOU'RE IN LOVE WITH YOUR HUSBAND. IT HAPPENS. YOU HAVE SOUL, PHILLIP. I THINK THAT'S WHAT ATTRACTED ME TO YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE. NOT MY SMILE? WELL, THE SMILE GOES WITHOUT SAYING, AND I HOPE YOU DON'T TAKE THIS THE WRONG WAY, BUT, YOU KNOW, THE FACT THAT YOU WERE ATTRACTED TO ME, YOU'LL NEVER KNOW HOW IMPORTANT THAT WAS. MAGGIE, HOW COULD ANYBODY NOT BE ATTRACTED TO YOU? DISFRUTA LA VIDA. I'LL HAVE ANOTHER COCO LOCO, PLEASE. [CHUCKLES] SO TELL ME, GEORGE, WHEN WAS THE MOMENT YOU SAID, "HEY, THERE'S AN ELEPHANT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LIVING ROOM. WE NEED A DIVORCE"? GLORIA, I'M AN IDIOT. - OH, I THINK YOU'RE GREAT. - OH, THANKS. THAT MEANS A LOT BECAUSE I HAD MORE FUN WITH YOU THE OTHER DAY THAN I HAVE HAD IN YEARS, AND THAT'S THE PROBLEM. - THAT'S A PROBLEM? - YES. YOU SEE, I NEED TO HAVE FUN WITH MY WIFE-- MY EX-WIFE OR WHATEVER-- I MEAN, IF SHE'LL LET ME. TELL ME THIS IS MAKING SENSE. UH...IN A WAY. GLORIA, YOU ARE AN EXTRAORDINARY WOMAN, AND YOU WILL NEVER KNOW HOW MUCH YOU HAVE CHANGED MY LIFE. GET A MASSAGE EVERY DAY AND NEVER STOP WINDSURFING. 20 BUCK TIP? GENEROUS GUY. WHAT DO YOU EXPECT FROM A BANKER? [TELEPHONE RINGS] HA HA HA! HELLO? HELLO? OH, YES. OH. HEE HEE HEE! THANK YOU, ANTONIO. OH, SAY HELLO FOR ME. OW. GEORGE, WE'RE GONNA MISS OUR PLANE. ANTONIO IS SENDING A CAR FOR US. WHAT TIME IS IT? HA HA HA! I DON'T FEEL DIVORCED... NEITHER DO I. AND I DON'T FEEL MARRIED, EITHER. HOW DO YOU FEEL? BETTER. ME, TOO. OH, THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH. HERE YOU GO. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. BYE. I TIPPED THEM $4.00, $2.00 EACH. IT'S GREAT. IT'S NOT TOO MUCH? PERFECT. MAGGIE, WE CAN'T BE DIVORCED. HOW ARE WE GONNA TELL THE KIDS? MAGGIE, WILL YOU MARRY ME? ANTONIO, WOULD YOU MARRY US, PLEASE? I WOULD BE HONORED, BUT IT'S NOT NECESSARY BECAUSE I DID NOT FILE THE DIVORCE PAPERS. MY DEAR MR. AND MRS. WESTON, YOU MUST UNDERSTAND. SO MANY COUPLES COME TO MANZANILLA EACH YEAR, BUT WHEN I SAW YOU, SOME VALENTINO SPOKE TO ME, AND HE SAID, "ANTONIO, HERE ARE TWO PEOPLE WHO DESPERATELY WANT TO FIX A LOVE THAT IS BROKEN." WAS I WRONG TO LISTEN? NO. GEORGE, WE COULD RENEW OUR VOWS. BUT THERE'S NO TIME. THEY'RE BOARDING. NO, NO, NO. BOARDING AND LEAVING, TWO VERY DIFFERENT PROCEDURES. HEY! [SNIFFING] AND DO YOU, MAGGIE WESTON, TAKE GEORGE WESTON TO LOVE, HONOR, AND OBEY-- UH, "OBEY." NO. WE DON'T GO THERE. AMERICANS. TO CHERISH FOREVER IN SICKNESS AND HEALTH FROM THIS DAY FORWARD AS LONG AS YOU BOTH SHALL LIVE? I DO. NOW YOUR RING. YOUR RING. WHERE'S YOUR RING, GEORGE? WHERE IS IT? UH... GOOD BOY. GOOD BOY. GOOD DOG. GOOD BOY. THERE IT IS. AH. AH. HA HA! WITH THE POWER VESTED IN ME AS CHIEF MAGISTRATE OF MANZANILLA, I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU MAN AND WIFE... AGAIN.
