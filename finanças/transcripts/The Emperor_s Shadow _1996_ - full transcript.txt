Would sire begin the rites, please? Would sire begin the rites, please? The rites will begin sing the imperial anthem By decree, sacrifice the instruments Music is a base thing and musicians are base people after my death, execute anyone who supports musician "bow-wow" "bow-wow" "two little doggies, dreaming of a bone" "bow-wow, biting all night long" "biting all night, mouths full of fur" "bow-wow, not a bone in sight" the dog has a bone, but the qin prince hasn't even got his mother's breast he's tough, bites so hard it hurts he takes ten times as much as our son qur jianli is weak as a lamb like you, only up to playing the gin Gao jianli, is that all you can play? Give us something soothing and feminine time to get to work Prepare to execute the qin hostages How dare you look at me ying zheng execute the qin hostages begin Don't be afraid close your eyes and listen to my music the axe's sharp it'll be over in one blow you won't feel any pain "bow-wow" "bow-wow" "two little doggies, dreaming of a bone" "bow-wow, biting all night long" "biting all night, mouths full of fur" keep the prince, he'll come in handy we can use him for sacrifice "two little doggies, dreaming of a bone" "bow-wow, biting all night long" "biting all night, mouths full of fur" "bow-wow, not a bone in sight" We're going to die for sure what will happen after we die? I'll order them to take us back to qin our burial mound will be a mountain both our name will be on the tombstone where will our heads he? On top of the burial mound no, that's dirty I'll put them on top of your gin No, your prince is a hostage in my state Take the qin prince home I've only conquered half my rivals yet you play this romantic stuff trying to make me seduce your mothers? Court music has always been this way court music, I want a national anthem who wrote this stuff? It's not even up to gao jianli's ditties this is your speech read it in the west, hanzhong fortress in mine north, I have animals that can be ridden to the south, I have a mountain barrier in the east, yaohan fortress in mine the fields are fertile. The people are rich I have a formidable army the best resources and forces in China sire, you must wear these robes all the other kings wear them and that's why they've failed victory to your majesty father I've come to watch the fun but that guy didn't want me to you're here now, aren't you? You're plumper now, I can marry you off I'm sure someone's here to ask for you When we conquer the yan kingdom may my son marry you daughter? Let's go, that's enough don't be in such a hurry there are two more kingdoms after yan, wang jian once you've conquered them all your son will marry the Princess I swear this before the gods and before all the men assembled here victory to your majesty for 550 years, we've been fighting to conquer all under heaven I'm the 32nd king in the qin line now heaven is smiling on me I've conquered 3 kingdoms already only three remain; Yan, chu and qi when I have conquered them all I will cease to be a king I will become the first emperor an eternal empire begins with you sire, isn't chu set down to be conquered before yan? I changed the order why? Because there is someone in yan who can write me an anthem Such precious wood, ruined I must bring the qin king a trophy you mean this? You are the most perceptive if take your head and a map of yan then I can approach him I can avenge your family and the nation I have to die anyway, but you will need someone's help varnish if, I've kept you waiting I hear you're leading the yan resistance, is that so? The qin king forced me to flee, he slaughtered my whole family what's past is past, jianli the qin king has sent for you many times he must like your music very much so why doesn't he come himself? He is coming; The qin army is at our borders if you accompany our assassin you'll prevent qin hegemony unification would be good musical notes could be standardized then music could spread everywhere let me play my new tune never pass up a chance to savor beauty This guy's no assassin Having the chance to hear your music is worth dying for you're so noble to sacrifice yourself If you really can kill the qin king use one blow to avoid pain the yan ambassador is here to surrender the yan ambassador is here to surrender the yan ambassador is here to surrender There have been 17 attempts on my life changing clothes is a security measure I hope you understand to demonstrate yan's sincerity I have brought a traitor's head General fan, why did you betray me? The world has one less hero - bury it in his family grave - Yes, sire I also wish to present this map of yan that's not necessary I know yan better than the yan king it's already included on our map the yan ambassador will depart I have a message from gao jianli gao jianli? How is he? He rises and sleeps with his qin have you heard him play? His music is as mighty as your name what is his message? I'm afraid to repeat it I guarantee your life he advises peace and an end to killing all disputes can be negotiated then all the people can live in peace to express sincerity, and put it in the map - what? To express sincerity, gao has cut off his forefinger and put it in the map, he ask me to present it to you bring it over Only gao's hands can produce such music how could he cut his finger off? Open it Now you have been cheated, too conquer the yan kingdom, lay it to waste study with me for one year then you will see things my way the qin army has entered the city. I can become your pupil after the war your grasp of the qin is still shallow the key is expressing divine virtue don't worry about the war the qin wouldn't dare come near me gao jianli, show yourself what an awful voice, like a broken drum there's no need to be polite No My mother nursed your king Why did our king spare you? I need to piss piss in your pants, so this is your 24-hour companion? It's just a lump of wood, have you heard the qin drums? That's music to my ears you don't appreciate fine music but one can always improve oneself put your ear close, you'll hear heaven Hear it? Now that's music to the ears Your kingdom's crack troops only fit to work as slaves on the great wall and the sacrificial altar when he rules all, our king will be called emperor why won't my father give me some slaves? Aren't you tired, carting me about? He should swap you around that's impossible, only eunuchs like us may serve you that's an iron-cast rule what a place, even whose act so grand you've insulted my fiance, the Princess, brand this on now what are you doing? I'm gao jianli stop Ma'am, this prisoner insulted you really? Say it again even whores act so grand take me over there prepare the brand, I want some fun, too Get your king here say it again, I'll brand you each time get your king here What is this man's crime? Hiding banned books, spreading rumors what is a banned book? Any brood you ban, sire and what is rumour? Any speech you have banned, sire good what should his punishment be? Who is this? Why don't recognize him? This is prince xianwu - xianwu - Give birth by concubine suzhu how come you know it all so well? Because she and I are both from zhao suzhu? She's dead now hu hai, what do you think? Draw and quarter him good, draw and quarter him for floating Remember, my decrees are the law of qin my will is the will of the state all that adds up to one basic principle you're princes, but if you break the law you will receive the same punishment yes, sire Wang Ben, who did this? Your majesty decreed all yan prisoners be branded did I order you to brand gao jianli? Remove this brand doctor remove the brand from his forehead jianli, this is all my fault the wound is too deep to be removed you must find a way, go yes, sire jianli, you have suffered terribly but if yan'd won, I'd have been branded in that case, would you've visited me? Sire release him you're no swordsman, you weren't a brave kid, either you wet yourself when we buried that guy when they executed hostages, so did you your cruelty makes heaven weep you are poisonous as a snake you are poisonous as a snake he's the only man I ever heard curse you jianli, you're becoming incoherent I've heard al this before cursing isn't one of your talents the people share my ambitions stick to music, you're good at that jianli you can live here in complete peace you'll live like a king but if acting like a spoilt child, history will remember you as a fool You're not allowed to leave, sir I want to shit Please go ahead, sir you're going to watch? Get out but we must guard your safety I'm getting closer to my grave now but I will conquer the chu kingdom however, I will need one million men you're not in your dotage yet one million men is our whole army if you fail, the kingdom will collapse I think five hundred thousand is enough the job requires one million victory will be difficult with less I still feel 500,000 is our limit you know chu like the back of our hand your son wang Ben will fight with you no one can stand up to our bravery we're so powerful, they'll be destroyed his majesty is exhausted from work he has so many things to attend to let's discuss it again tomorrow wang jian, li si, both of you have got a point to defeat chu requires a great force wang jian, I'll give you one million you can drown the chu capital in blood but just be sure you conquer it I will set out at once and smash chu we ask to leave wang jian sire you say you're closer to your grave no, your son's closer to becoming prince sire, we beg you, please eat if you don't, we may die Whose idea was this? He was hitting his head on the wall biting people and refusing food how long has he been on hunger strike? For three days, he's even refused water you idiots I don't care how, but make him eat I've sent men to exhume the yan king, from his burial mound your mother's remains are there now they were buried with full honours you're devoted to her, she nursed me so this is my gesture of respect jianli, after becoming king of qin I sent for you many times the yan king said if I needed you he'd send me your head I had to kill chicken to get the egg we've got some in Stay still, or you'll be a deaf king oops, I mean a deaf emperor even emperor is powerless sometimes is it that gao jianli again? Let him die if he wants to that'd be easy, but I want him to live if he died, I'd get all your attention you're as bad as he is other side other side If he died and then you get married I'll be left completely friendless I don't have any friends, either you say he dabbles at the gin dabble at the gin? I want to make him court composer nonsense you get the world under your thumb I'll get this mad man under my thumb you're the mad one women have their ways, you know Ok, you can have a go but if I succeed, I want him to teach me and to follow me everywhere it's a deal by hook or by crook, I'll succeed Just prepare it this way Were you raised on sow's mile? The meat hasn't been hung properly, it stinks carry me over Ma'am, this is steamed lizard Delicious If I could only walk, brands all over my body wouldn't bother me I'd be a happy woman Gao jianli, if you really are worse off than me maybe you are better off dead this is stewed wild boar My father has more than 30 daughters but he loves me the most I was the first born later on, when he had more children they didn't seem so special to him one time, he took me riding the horse reared and threw me I haven't been able to walk since I was like you then I wouldn't eat or drink, just wanted to die my father had told me so often that you are great musician but that's not the man I see I just see a walking corpse acting as stupidly as I did once A hero doesn't go back on his work Come walk on clouds with as soon as we have unified China we must standardize mage, currency and law weights and measures we must also gather all weapons and execute anyone hiding them weapons are material, that's easy but what about the non-material? How do we control that? By non-material, you mean hearts and minds hearts and minds the key to success or failure unless we gather them in, the empire will be unstable only when we've got them behind us will the empire's future be secure sire's words are pearls of wisdom you can write the qin imperial anthem lyrics thank you, sire but as for the music, gao jianli must compose that jianli, you're dying before die, I have something for you "Bow-wow" "two little doggies, dreaming of a bone" "bow-wow, biting all night long" "biting all night, mouths full of fur" "bow-wow" do you have any unfinished business? These are for your composition, sir this is the deer's blood you wanted What an achievement it seems that women really do have their ways now he can focus on that anthem remember we've got a deal, I've brought him round so make him my qin teacher, make him become my shadow I want to change him. I want to tame him like a horse a horse? I was only kidding you can't hold me to it you rule all the land on earth everyone is your subject he is my only captive, now you want him back a king never kids around alright, he can teach you the qin, he can be your shadow I give my consent you silly girl, even you belong to me This capital of chu will be my fifth betrothal gift once we take qi, even ying zheng will have to stick to him word you mean we're risking our lives just so I can marry a cripple? Grow up, so what if she's a cripple or blind, deaf, a hunchbacked cretin you must marry her for me she will ensure the family future Master gao is here for your lessons gao jianli, come in Have you remembered your scales? Caress it, don't pluck at it, begin Plucking at it again? It's not your fault I can't quite compose this piece right I am a slave now I have a miserable life ahead of me my last request in this life is to possess your body to commit a capital offence You've broken my leg and my ankle, too I've transgressed against the king. I'm sure to die so, you still want to die Before I die, I want to give this, to your fiance, wang Ben if you've got the guts give it to my father Come back you're standing up yueyang, you're standing up You've broken my leg you've broken everything An angel has descended I wanted to die all along I wanted to die all along lisi, zhao gao, you're so learned but which of you could do this gao's music can make a cripple walk sire, gao jianli has gone mad organize a banquet, tonight we celebrate You beast, you shat in my bed Such precious wood and gin Yueyang is walking. It's miracle - what I bury is miracle - It's miracle what I bury is miracle I've got the key to my tune your tune will be your baffled curies the most beautiful sound on earth and I'm the only person to hear it. What a shame I wanted to die all along Dig him out You won't get the better of me I'm scared, father let me go, I don't want to ride I won't do it. I'm too scared I made you fall off one horse now I want to see you ride another father What's that stink? They're scenting my clothes with calms we use absinth in qin, no change is allowed jianli use calms, he got this scent on him how dare you mention his name, you wanted to ride him like horse how could you let the horse ride you? You robes, ma'am I grew up with eunuchs non-men you've always talked to me of gao jianli and you gave him to me, I saved his life and he make me walk again, aren't you happy? Knee do it properly saving gao was your father's command marrying wang Ben is your king's command that's loyalty to me and the state gao is a wonderful musician but he doesn't respect my law he's finished unless he changes his ways I'm not a virgin anymore you're my daughter, the Princess of qin I won't be married to wang Ben disobeying me is a capital crime you're the bond I promised you're my bargaining chip with army you're a hostage to my will, understand? I'm not a hostage, I am your daughter You've helped me, so I will forgive you but there's to be no more funny business remember, my decrees must be obeyed come in - father take her to pray in the clan temple Defeating chu is a great victory so why do you all look so miserable? We have just risked our lives in battle how can we be insulted like this? This matter has major consequences gao even dared violate the Princess if we do not execute him how can we uphold the law? You're completely off the Mark you can't arrest without a complaint who's the plaintiff here? I can accuse him as chief justice but your daughter hasn't been violated as she made a complaint to you I'll accuse him But you have to catch them in the act what evidence do you have? Listen, if there's a plaintiff in this case it's gao jianli it was yueyang who violated him in that case, she must be punished a woman violating a man do we have provisions for such a crime? I know our law, and we do not you oversight, chief justice I guess sire is changing the law again violators and the violated get promoted in that case, please let me step now Listen, violation and illicit sex are different I'm not even sure it was illicit she took him like taking medicine and he's make her walk again actually, wang Ben, you're the one reaps the benefit I've given gao a warning already if it happens again, I'll castrate him to protect him from future violation put your hat back on, chief justice we'll see how you handle this you are involved in matters of state why do you care about other people's sex lives do we rely on sex to build the empire? The qi sword still hangs here do you see it? Wipe your eyes, look, zhao, read this by royal decree, wang Ben is now a Marquis with 3000 serf households thank you, sire the sacrificial altar is your job if you fail you'll punished The grasses made you immortal - right? - Yes how old are you now, then? I don't remember exactly but over 2500 year old - right what bull, but it is very poetic your majesty, in my humble opinion these sorts cause trouble you're wrong, if the nobility get involved in this they won't think to rebel "Moving boulders, 1000 pounds on my back" "1000 men stoop, so one can reach heaven" Gao jianli is a troublemaker listen to this song, it seems asking them to overturn you wrong again, the song moves me at the river sacrifice, we'll have gao jianli lead the chant have you written the lyrics yet? We lost on the battlefield but gao has conquered the qin in bed he should be rewarded with a promotion let's call him the music king a king with no kingdom is worth a fart he should be a Saint, the music Saint no, he had sex with the Princess he's the Saint of womanizer the Saint of womanizer I have come for the Saint of womanizer "River, river, so vast and wide" "rushing, roaring down from the skies" "chanting, chanting, we join the tide" "Blasting, smashing, out the mountainside" Your majesty, the Princess' legs wound haven't recovered this is host dangerous What a pity. She's not a prince then I'd have a worthy successor gao has changed my lyrics listen, blasting smashing he's criticizing you and suggesting the kingdom is unstable the song is brilliant now you grasp that hearts matter, and so do musicians but don't read too much into the song that gao will compose, the anthem is set I might make him court composer, too are you kidding, or making a decree? - What do you think? - I think you must be kidding jokes and decrees can be the same, look but the gods were angry why? Because half the lids weren't virgins no wonder they wouldn't let us land xu gui - your majesty how about I send your brother with 1200 children to get those grasses? Wonderful - excellent and I guarantee they'll all be virgins thank you, sire ok, float downriver to the China sea talk it over with the island ods - you're off to go - No, your majesty no, majesty majesty majesty understand? The king never jokes Music is like people, full of sadness Yes, but no hatred, it's sublime have you seen a genius like him before? My only wish is to make yueyang smile if she smiles, I smile, too and if I smile, everyone smiles but sire, I want to weep If you weep, I weep too and if I weep, everyone weeps gao, only one have this ability father, you are incapable of tears this is the second time we've shared a ride you first your majesty, wouldn't dare but you have my consent you might throw me out again I wasn't me that did that look, we're served his majesty so long but has that ever happened to us? Stop Those two brothers thought they'd con me I certainly played along with them one's dead the other's off to sea with the kids to find that island we'll incorporate it into the kingdom if he can't, the fish will eat him you can't feed the kids to the fish, too why not? It's a gamble, but losing can be fun, too xu fu smelt fishy he's the one who's not a virgin you're right, why didn't I think of that? Stop Your brother must be out at sea by now he wouldn't dare delay an important job I want to see if you are a virgin or not your majesty you're pushy, just like your falter no one can resist the calamus and absinth are mixed now do you still want to die? I'd willingly die to be with you an assassin block the roads and catch him Your wagon has fallen into a trap Your majesty, gao jianli protected the Princess but he himself is seriously wounded save him this is the 19th attempt on my life we're searching for the assassin and get information - so we'll get them all - That's no use kill everyone for a mile around as sire decrees better make it three miles do as he says I've lost again, I won't play anymore you eunuchs are too clever it was my only brother who castrated me but as a prince, you have many brothers just think if they took up the knife sir, I've won again even a dwarf like you dares outdo me We've found it, sire we need a man with Yang energy's hair it can restore circulation we will seek such a man at once cut the crap no, not a hair on your head may be harmed your majesty word from general wang jian he is too sick for the strategy meeting you're tired, too, shall we postpone? We will proceed as planned winning qi is our final task, no delay I have an order send ten doctors to see wang jian if he's breathing, he'll be here he's alive, jianli's alive so, your hair got his circulation going you've had a nice long nap for five days yueyang's been by your side all along wasn't I performing for you just now the river mists have lifted my spirit has been released I call this ode to yueyang If you can express our velour in the anthem even the heaven will be moved my strength is elegant little tunes anthems are grand, not what I do best no, listen to their chant nothing light and romantic about that and did you compose it? That's just a folk tune from my home I've been a hostage since I was born move away get out of here, my life's been at risk for twelve years I could've died anytime only this tune of yours which you call just a folk tune rescues me from the fear of death I have sought death but without success I have tired but failed to throw it off sometimes I try to strike out against it but something holds me back death is my addiction jianli, fate gave you to me you are a part of me now you must suffer together with me and also receive the punishment with me the qin anthem is ode, you've written ode to yueyang so you can make millions sing my anthem You will not only compose the qin anthem you will also become court composer sometimes self-sacrifice is unavoidable I only compose music to amuse myself A million-strong army has set out once qi is conquered, I'll be wang Ben's you will never see me again. You must compose the qin anthem you must become court composer but make marrying me your condition Your majesty Get out of here I want to see you drunk take gao back to his chambers. He is recovering so take care of him yes, sire the Princess is confined to her quarters how far may she go? The two watch towers, no one may enter what about... - What? - Gao jianli no one The scripts of the other kingdoms including qi by those of qin then I will write my first edict this will be to make gao court composer that position's responsible for rites only royalty has had the job before a branded man cannot do this job what battles has he won? He won to merit this? A biting mad man whose jumbled tunes jangle the senses who else feels this way? We all do zhao gao, what about you? I think he's fine for the anthem but as for becoming court composer I see you're opposed, too wang jian, what do you think? I'm sick, I've got one foot in the grave I dare not meddle in affairs of state li si, you're my sole supporter I'm still unclear when you're kidding one more time, the king never jokes then send gao to sea to feed the fish Meng yi - yes, sire I sent you to register households in wei but you brought back ten concubines you're wife distraught, is that proper? Feng jie - yes, sire your skill with the dice is legendary you gamble and use signings for usury what sort of proper behavior is that? Zhao gao - yes, sire I heard you got married again your 31st time, right? Trying to out do my predecessors, huh? Why wasn't I asked to the reception? I didn't dare disturb you, sire why does a eunuch get married anyway? To have someone to talk to li si - yes, sire you're the only one without concubines I have no time for such matters you share your bed with boys - is this true? - It's true but apart from that, I have no hobbies I'm going to give you a rare opportunity there are 600 boys out at sea now you should go with them I think you'd be their ideal companion the qi sword is still not at rest the blood we've spilt hasn't dried yet we're getting decadent, like our rivals stupid and debauched desire can lead astray or give an aim music tricks ear, but can also move it it can make me sing or weep and make everyone else follow we don't just want to brand prisoners we also want to brand hearts and minds the anthem will enable us to do this gao jianli is anyone still oppose? Good don't cool your arises in the breeze sit up set forth take the major qi towns first when you attack the capital, I will come with this battle, we will unify China and gao will fight for hearts and minds - you are all dismissed - Yes, sire I'm working to guarantee the marriage we'll hold the wedding when we return what do you think? No need to be so formal the whole game hangs on this final one I hear I have 8000 palace women I've picked you a few, there are others lovely, very nice I should have done this long ago I've told my courtiers to forgive you without women, they'd be like caged cats hang on you're a puny little guy these are for wang Ben, I want yueyang she's my masterpiece of the bunch, I only want one bloom ok, go ask wang Ben then wang jian they've served us for three generations think the army and ministers will agree if you won't give me yueyang, kill me killing you is killing the qin anthem heaven desires my desires come before heaven's come I want yueyang you want yueyang, and she likes that so do I but you must yield for the qin empire wait until you've made your name then you can turn the game round I'd rather join the work gang again and die on your sacrificial altar is that up to you? My brother is at the east China sea he has sent news to me in a dream I wanted to send you floating after him I shall set out the minute I hear you have become emperor are these the virgins you've prepared? Wonderful what a pity there aren't enough of them you could pick up a trick from him Why've you come to this lowly place? General wang, your father has almost conquered qi his majesty will lead the final charge You do things too much by the book and gao wouldn't be bothering you now yueyang can walk now and I will benefit so gao's done me a favor really how magnanimous your ancestors must be proud of you today I must thank him properly Your majesty, something's happened We've discovered some words on a rock the slaves say it's a heavenly prophecy - let's see it - What does the prophecy say? Ying will die and his empire divide So heaven wants me dead, is that it? Some of you have dared to forge the word of heaven you are all shielding the criminals you will be divided into groups a group died each time the drum sounds until you hand over the culprit Jianli, I'm waiting to hear a prophecy that ying zheng will die and his empire divide why do you have to kill to rule? Why do you need strings to play a tune? You're killing like moving down grass if I die and the empire is divided and will revert to chaos Which group is this? A rare guest, bring him in still on one has owned up you dare come just to tell me that the blades are dull with use I've sent for fresh ones I'm docking 10 days pay "River, river, so vast and wide" "rushing, roaring down from the skies" "chanting, chanting, we join the tide" killing is against the way of heaven I'll show you the way of heaven in the 15th year of Duke zhuang 58000 qin soldiers died in the 33rd year of Duke mu 94000 qin citizens died 550 years of warfare, all the qin acquired were corpses where was the way of heaven then? And what about when we were yoked together? When you were on the Princess where was the way of heaven? War, legislation, your little affair they're all a game of chess I can only move by the rules of the game here is no other way for me to survive I carved that prophecy into the stone kill me and stop slaughtering the others you have no right to ask to die my aim is to put an end to war I may have to kill a million for that I should've died a hundred times already but I've got unfinished business you can't die your music helps me escape fear and understand my people jianli, we should follow the true way of heaven together, we should see China united and the people's hearts united, too I will compose the qin anthem I will be your court composer I will be as loyal as your shadow I will let you marry yueyang to wang Ben just stop the slaughter but why did they write that prophecy? I wish you and your empire immortality now you must kneel before me By my decree cease the executions the old gao jianli no longer exists you are now the qin court composer with the status of a Duke If it's not powerful enough, add 20 more drums sir, there's not enough time you must hurry. The ceremony must be perfect sir, it's just a ritual I don't think that's all my anthem is but the qin anthem has become a yan song you're a hero and highly refined you're even more refined that chime needs to be filed down yes, sir you and I are the same but you've saved 25,000 slaves' lives and you got promoted to a high position I'm pale by comparison - again starting with the drums You must wear this in case of attack that's too heavy, and unaffordable these qi soldier are half-starved they couldn't even pull back here bows you must wear it I sorrow for the people look do I really need to wear this? Note that down no, forget it sir, shouldn't we stop for the victory rite How could you dare not join in? So, you're an arrogate official now yueyang I am also under his majesty orders I must go to the clan temple and pray I'm dropping by to congratulate you yueyang do you want to be a deaf composer? You should congratulate me, too I want to play on my wedding night when wang Ben and I make love when I make love, miracles happen once with you and I could walk wang Ben is a great qin general so he may make me ascend to heaven yueyang wang Ben should've killed you in yan and I shouldn't have got you to eat all the official posts and music in qin wouldn't stop your father from marrying you to wang Ben that policy is absolute ok, get on with your qin anthem Invincible the six kingdoms were corrupt and cruel the qin king nobly sent out his army he has eliminated the violence and peace now reigns all around invincible... Smelt it down with the others I swear that I, Princess yueyang daughter of the 32nd king of qin will do as ordered and marry... - Mr. gao - Everyone except gao jianli the rest get out I'm afraid you're going too far you dare instruct me? Get out your father's sword is on my neck I have no idea when it's going to fall think of it as my caressing hands that's what makes your skin tingle I can make you run make you fly ancestors, open your eyes wide I'm jianli's woman the clan temple is my bridal chamber jianli belongs to me You dare raise the way of heaven again it's just chess to you, I don't get it you're committed the worst evil possible what sort of a bitch are you? For our friendship, kill me with one blow one blow? You'll die of 1000 cuts This punishment is ages old horse piss is poured on hot coal the steam is waffled into the eyes it causes blindness but it is painless, without side-effects this punishment is precise and elegant but it's quite involved and we don't use it anymore what crime is it for? Peeping Toms, watching court women bath will receive this punishment I thought you said it didn't hurt that's what the book says Take him away gao has nothing to do with politics what I want is his musical talent his talent must serve the empire His death would be a terrible loss in our fight for hearts and minds Can you see me? I can see some monstrous shadow in chess, you can't avoid losing pieces but I will produce the anthem in time for your installation as emperor it would be a draw game. I will only make music then a blind man cannot be court composer You make things very hard for me I feel as though, I'm between a rock and hard place jianli, are you a man or a devil? 2 dogs must fight if there's only bone but who wants the bone if one dies? I've understood that since I was a kid I was made king at the age of 13 I had the strangest dream that night headless ghosts were chasing me they have to be the six kingdoms I ran, I ran to you, then ghosts went away you were playing your qin, that has to be the qin anthem then I flew up into the clouds I was still running yes, that must mean climbing the sacrificial altar, and lighting the fire know what I dreamt of first time I came you, what else could it be but a woman? And I was sucking your mother's tits And it came true, it all came true with yueyang you sensitive musicians, whining al the time you're just not patient enough jianli, all rivers end up in the sea wait two or at most five years wang Ben will have died in some war yueyang needs only one year of mourning then she can marry you. Can't you hold out that long? - Your majesty - Don't call me that as many people as ants but very few are Sincere you're the only person who has the right to call me brother Before you marry yueyang, I want to hear you call me brother your majesty Your promotion has come to nothing, and so has your qin anthem but ying zheng knows what you're about true his sword could land on my neck anytime but I have a little dagger up my sleeve because I know what this court's about we bet with our lives, and are doomed but a little dagger can kill, too hasn't enough blood been shed? Do you think being court composer has lessened the bloodshed? You saved 25000 yan prisoners but they were killed at the great wall because another stone was found and on it were the same etchings your forbearance has been useless you are a meaningless sacrificial pawn all your effort has gone waste you don't see it, but I do the great wall is red with blood today is a day of red upon red ying zheng stains the great wall red and dresses his daughter in bridal red sir, are you going to see the bride off? There are 6 swords in my hair now we are both qin slaves now, one and the same and yet not, I will never see you again maybe that's for the best you'll never see me grow old My condolences, sir I'm playing for yueyang your not male-not female hands have polluted my tune we eunuchs cannot compare with you, sir your passion made yueyang such a Thorn in his side that wang Ben soaked the bridal chamber in blood I was only able to lend a hand I killed him and jailed his father I suppose I have avenged you, sir in fact, yueyang bit off her own tongue and die They are yueyang's hands, you keep them So many murders, what a storm if goes on like this the ceremony will be rained out such a bad omen for the empire what can we do? The ceremony starts in two hours put on your imperial robes, sire why won't you tell me the truth? Wait till after the ceremony our condolences to your majesty today's ceremony establishes the qin empire and makes you the emperor an eternal empire begins with you, sire all families have lost members for qin could yours be the only one not to? Everything has its price but why it have to be yueyang? She'd just learnt to run, and she ran so beautifully why won't you tell me the truth? Ok, but you must put on your robes because you must complete the ceremony wang Ben cut off her head first then her feet and hands and her breasts, finally, he cut off her vagina zhao gao and I killed him Gao jianli, you caused yueyang's death we were both only sire's pawns even wild animals can cry, but not you this rain is the tears of wronged ghosts it will drown your capital then let the wronged ghosts sing for me I'll tell you the real way of heaven it is the Victor's face An eternal empire begins with you An eternal empire begins with you I, ying zhen have unified China I proclaim myself the first emperor after me, will come the 2nd and 3rd, and so on to eternity qin's glories and virtues are numberless I command the qin anthem be performed in honor of the gods, and I light the sacrificial flame I proclaim the qin I command the qin anthem be performed in honor of the gods, and I light the sacrificial flame I proclaim history will record that when you were installed, I attacked you wrong, I write the history books and they will say that I kept you alive because you are my eternal shadow gao has taken poison and will die After four hours of extreme pain his organs will fail and he'll die jianli brother
