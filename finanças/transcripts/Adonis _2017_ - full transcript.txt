Subtitles by Mewss No need to dance today Just strip naked and lay on that cross. Quick! Yang Ke, come on. The round one. The square one. Have you found it? Text: "A flower is a universe. A leaf is a Buddha" Sister Yin! Sister Yin! What's the hurry? I have a lifetime for you. His father passed away before he was born. He may have reincarnated as this child. He is still by your side, so no need to be sad. His father has passed him the discounted fortune. You are the only one I trust. You won't cheat me, right? The group leader just disappeared like that? None of you got a single penny back? You got totally ripped off. Fellow countryman, let's be partners. I want to quit this job ages ago. I can be your agent. Let's split the profit 30/70 You 70 and me 30. You have conditions, I have relationships. My friend is after a model for a wedding gown photo shoot. He needs to be tall, wealthy looking and gorgeous. Tall, wealthy looking and gorgeous... - Go away! - Claf! Lie down! I quit! I don't want the money. I said I could not do it. I will pay any compensation, just let me go! - Let him go please! - Shut up! He is my brother. Leave the costume! Then... there aren't enough people. You are the replacement. Action! Give your half first. Relax! Go now. Over there. There. Handsome, where do you come from? Shandong. No wonder you're so tall. I'm the only tall one in my family. So many mosquitoes. Now the shooting starts. Turn your body a little. A hand on your head. Both hands now, and spread your legs! Move you hand away! Don't try to hide your dick! Now, sit down! Open your legs wide! Wider! Kid you're really good looking. You should be an actor. I'm a Beijing Opera performer. But the theatre group went bankrupt. We're owned half a year of wages. Now I can't even pay my rent. Touch your breast. Let yourself look sexier. That's much better. Raise your ass. Lean backward. Now turn over! Hurry! Turn over Now hold your genitals! Grab it! Don't cover it! Just hold it! That's gorgeous! Thank you handsome, bye now! Get famous soon, and we'll publish your photo album then. Look, my friend bought this in Thailand. Did you enjoy it? This shot is a bit too long. You went all the way! Did it hurt? It wasn't real, was it? You haven't worn anything in the movie so far. Finish? That's hardly been 30 minutes.... Don't be mad! Let me handle this. Boss Xu! Wang Qiang, what's up? You bastard! What's the fuss? All actors have to start somewhere, even superstars. Boss Xu, that doesn't make sense. We agreed to shoot art films only. Yang Ke is an artist after all. I say this is art. Both the director and I graduated from Art Uni. We have written hundreds of scripts since. Only this genre attracts investors. By the way, I am not the boss. I am just an agent, a parasite like you. You are such a conman! What about Venice? The film festival you promised? You can't be still dreaming about that. It's just my... There's no way we can get into such an elite film festival. We can't even afford travel expenses. Be realistic young man! You ruined Ke's image. - You must compensate us. - Sure?. I was about to call. Actually, Ke should thank me. Soon after the release Wealthy women came specifically for him. I am gay! Really? The male patrons have deeper pocket. Are you a top or a bottom? Get a rope! Can you do genuine sex? Bastard! Since all is void, where can the dust settle? What are looking at? Never seen a big dick before? Call the police! How right the wall, how wrong the egg. Text: "The Venetian Macao" Did you hear what... Xu Jin Said? We both should think about it. I don't dare mention it if you don't first. Although it is a dirty thing... I mean you are a big man. You can choose what to do. No one can force you. Start! Go first and be rewarded. Boy... This is Abe, the hottest one here. No, Yang Ke must be the best here. I have seen your show. I am your fan. This is our Gifted and Talented House. The place is for talented people in music, poetry, painting, dancing, cooking... Let me introduce our five sects. First... Welcome! Big brother, sit here! Sir, please take a rest first and I will serve you tea. Please, have some tea. Do you want the same dishes today? - Yes, please. - I get it. You know Japanese? Our guests are from many countries in the world. You know, in Japan, homosexuality is still illegal. So when they have a chance to play, they go crazy. I heard that Japanese guests are so rich? The are really generous and their tips are good. How much? Sorry to keep you waiting! Your feast is ready! This is tough. You have to stand the itch. Also you can't be on duty having a cold, fever or cough. You practiced Chinese Opera for a long time. How long does a meal like this take? Usually 45 minutes. Overtime will be charged. There were customers that took so long that the model needed to take a piss. And one guy requested to collect his urine. And drank it like a beer? Special charge should apply. What an experience. The scars... No way... I still need to appear on camera. This kind of sex is not usual. Sometimes famous actors are invited to join. 5 000 dollars at once. Are you done? Not yet. At the end of the game there will be opportunities to work with film companies. Never thought it could be you, brother. We're sorry. Move! One bye one. Relax. Then it will hurt less. You sissy, be dirty! This isn't a love drama. Mommy, where did I come from? From my tummy of course. Didn't you ask that before? So what's daddy for? You were made by something from daddy that got inside mommy. What's that thing? That's too quick. Only ejaculation will be counted. Is daddy in hell? I hope not. He should have been reincarnated. Teacher says all of us have to be tried in hell. Text: "Court 2: Prostitutes thrown into a pool of blood and drowned." Text: "Court 6: Possession of pornographic material. Body sawn into two" Teacher wants you to be a good child. and grow up to be a good man. I am scared of going to hell. I don't want to die. Death isn't that scary. Life can be like hell too. Come. Chant the "six syllable Mantra" together with mommy. Om Ma Ni Pe Me Hum... Om Ma Ni Pe Me Hum... Om Ma Ni Pe Me Hum... Om Ma Ni Pe Me Hum... Om Ma Ni Pe Me Hum... Next! Sit. Yes? A small token of appreciation. How delicate. It breaks my heart to see you being used by the secular people. Let me take care of you. Everyday just wash and massage me. No more than what you're usually doing to make a living. I will soon stop having "periods". There's a lot I can't do even if I desire it. Other than that Just accompany me on trips and banquets. Drive my luxury car. Wear the latest fashion I bought you from Milan. Let my old buddies die of jealousy. When at home, you don't need to wear anything. Like the painter David Hockney and his boyfriend Peter. They stayed together and played the romance story. Regarding paintings. My collection comprises of nothing but unique items! You love art. When my time is up. They're all yours! Xu Jin, your turn! Want to tie me, go? Try my good stuff. He'll die! Do it to me! Brother! Brother Are you okay, brother? Ke, be strong! You have to survive it. I know it's too much for you. But that's a thousand dollars for each fuck. We are much closer to the goal. Forgive me. Brother... You should have followed their order. We are not blood brothers anyway. You are my brother in every sense of the word. I couldn't do it, even if I were gay. That was my first time. I rather give it to you. Uncle is cooking now. Let me check out mom. No need. Sis Yin will come over for her. Don't worry! Sis Yin will always be with you. Your mother will wake up after she's had enough sleep. Hello? Yes, this is Yang. I know that place. 45 minutes later, right? I'll be there. You've recovered well. There's a saying... I read from a Sutra that... The bodies of people who have achieved and practiced well in their lives... may attain "Rainbow Body" upon their death. They would then become transparent and disappear without a trace. What difference does it make when one is already dead? Life is short. Why bother wasting time on such senseless thoughts and studies? All yours. Hey, I'm leaving. Take care! Call me when you get home. I fell asleep. No problem. We will arrive soon. I won't vomit in your car. It's your car. I had a blue dream. "No. 1 in the chart this week is a new entry." "No wonder, it's Amanda!" Your new song. Nice. "She also appears in SCUD's new film." "And this song is their collaboration." Your face is familiar. Are you an artist too? I reckon. What about your boyfrend? - Who? - Jacky. You believe in that? I believe in everything. Let's drink! You forgot how we came here. You don't need to drive back, okay? Apart from designated driving... What other talents do you possess? You wanna try? Don't pester, Ke! What's wrong with brother Yang, mom? You always pick on him. He is... cursed, somehow. Superstitious! Superstitious? Everything is fated. I'll go take a shower. I need to know. What? Whether you don't like girls... or you just don't like me? Mom. You left me behind... once you found the painless world? At least you should tell me in my dream. Mother... Let's congratulate Yang Ke and his new bistro! - Hey handsome, congratulations! - Thanks! - I have to excuse myself. - Bye! - Congratulations! - Thanks! - Long time no see. - Thanks! - Such a nice place. - Drink and eat more then. Our superstar is reformed, congratulations! Thanks! Some appetizer first. Fronstage and backstage, perfect partners. You'll be rich in no time! You know what? The size of a man's penis is proportional to his nose. What about those who underwent plastic surgeries? Don't be shy. Fresh meat. What is the reason for a man to live? Not to die, I suppose. Mother is gone and the money came. How ironic. She's never meant to wake up. Don't torture yourself. Live the moment. What is "in the moment" For all the fun pleasure in the present. We are materialists after all. But you can not carry anything over to your next life. If I don't live long, I wanna leave all my money to Calf, Sister Yin and her daughter. Is that so? Sis Yin is the my mother's only friend. Calf is an orphan. Maybe you can prepare me a will or something. I'm good at documentation. Enjoy your meal. Why not drink in our own bar? Money is better kept in your own pocket. This is where we had our first drink together. Remember? Oh yes. Which year was that? There is something I should tell you. Remember the opening day of our bistro? There was a Caucasian guy. He wasn't with Abe's gang. - I'm Adonis. - Daniel. Nice to meet you. Too many people. I can't recall. I... Had a relationship with a man for the first time. His country legalized gay marriage. He's returning at the end of this year. I'll leave with him. So I should congratulate you? For all your taking care of me these few years. I can only return in the next life. Brother. I... want to wear your shoes. What is mine is yours. Just take them. Thanks, brother! I'm going now. Okay. I am leaving too. Thank you. See you next time. - Is this your bar? - Yes. We're not in that business anymore. Here is the time and place. No more than 2 hours. Another five thousand after. Okay. This weirdo is making me uncomfortable. It's not good to go. I don't have much time left here. I should earn more money for you. That day is my birthday. We can celebrate after. Why do I feel a little worried? There is no contact number to call. If you don't feel relieved, go with me. Master. I want to ask about my luck in love. - Love? - Yes. You look sick... maybe next time. Mom. The time is up. What? Forget it. Do you have a date? Yes. So tonight... Don't be late then. Go, quick! Alright. Hey! Enjoy the night! No need to hurry back. I was here before. You know what to do. Right? Will you keep wearing a mask? Who doesn't wear a mask? Could you be part of the crew? We originated earlier than that. Then treat me gentlier brother. It's my birthday today. - How old? - 30. You... don't recognize me at all? Happy birthday to me... Happy birthday to me... Happy birthday... Uncle! Wang Qiang! Beautiful, but what use if it won't last another minute? Hold back. I'll be swift. Om Ma Ni Pe Me Hum... Don't blame me. Blame your fate! Om Ma Ni Pe Me Hum... Ke. Sis Yin? Ke, you are dead. Let him go too. Sis Yin So you died as well? I am fated to be your company in your last trip. Life can be like hell too. When you woke up from the dream of death. You must have seen many strange scenes? Those were the doors to samsares. If it wasn't for your practice... you might've been absorbed into one of them. I was afraid I wouldn't catch you. But he... Why? What's incomprehensible in this life. You may find the answers from your previous lives. The elves you met in the bamboo forest... Were the illusions brought by your acquaintances in your previous life They're driving you to find out the truth. Within the forty-nine days after death and before reincarnation. One would still live in his consciousness without the restraint of a physical body. One can go anywhere according to one's will. So there are bardos exactly as what mother said. What you believe is what's real to you. Is that hell? It's human life. As illusory as the dream and the bubble. As momentary as the dew and the lightning. I thought that was the punishment for something I had done. I know you've been a sex worker. I would hardly call pleasing yourself and others wrongdoings Karma doesn't necessarily dawn in the present life anyway. Is it the heaven? It's human life too. Why am I here? This is Thailand. In one of your previous lives you were the monk who built the monastery. It should be his karma that led you here. That's why mother said I would enjoy a long and fulfilling life. However... I lied to her. You are the only one I trust. You won't cheat me, right? By the time you were born... I could already tell you wouldn't live beyond 30. If it is all fated... What's the point with trying so hard in our lives? You're an actor, right? Every movie inevitably must come to an end. Would you not try to give your best performance because of that? Even if it's a 30 minute short film, right? If you dive into Calf's anus now. You may follow his sperm and reincarnate to be his son. - Shall we name him Ke? - Um. Ke, call me papa! Ke! There seems to be no heaven. And no judgement day. The present is good enough though. Wang Qiang. I suppose you are fifty, right? Boss, you have perfect memory. Which means... when I was your age... the two of us were like... you and your poor compatriot countryman. Such a divine boy. Outlive by us... Shameless ugly old creatures. Why are we talking about that? Who have you been pretending to... up until this age? Making money is fine. But by taking a young life like that? Now, I know how he felt. - How old are you? - 25. - I am 18. - I'm 31. - Me 25. - I am 41. - I am 19. - I am 33. - I am 22. - 34. - I am 20. - I am 33. - I am 21. - 1004. Have you thought about... How you would be like when you're 30? 30... Little difference I guess. Naïve as now. I have a thought that I might not live beyond 30. I was doing the same job. As the role just assigned. An actor. Always an actor. I was hoping to act in a film by a good director. In Maldives with my loved one. Have earned enough to open a coffee shop in my country. I'm still a bit far from 30. So I'm not thinking about that yet. Gradually I found that we will grow up. We will be aged. Some things will never be the same again. If I could turn back the clock for 5 years. Even if only 3 years. Before 30, I felt that I'd never been myself. And now I really want to find the genuine me deep in my heart. Today has been very exciting. I haven't slept for nearly 2 days. It's an actor's dream to be in an art movie. - Mi first ever sex scene. - Experience of a lifetime. In front of so many people, what a feeling. I felt super honoured about doing this. Maybe when I'll look back when I am 40, 50. Today would have been an unparalleled experience. I am already reflecting on all these shooting days. I know I will miss it badly. If you were Yang Ke today... would you find the experience a pleasure or a torture? Pleasure I suppose. I think it's a torture. I can sense both. A paradox. - A paradox?. - Yes. I've hardly been so tense, even horrified. It's like a dungeon I wanted to escape from. It's so foreign and uncomfortable that... I would be too paranoid to act. I am not up to that yet. What is sex? Sex... Sex... Satiated or not, fulfilled or not. It's the passion of my life. So do you feel that you've found yourself in this career? I haven't been acting. Actually I'm being myself. I've always perceived myself as a product. Life is a different film than what we act. The door of life is suddenly wide ajar. Taking part in this project means a lot to me. Actually everyone is unique. So you just have to understand this, and look to yourself first. Inside yourself, and... When you realise this, that's the awakening. Sometimes we shouldn't think too much. Just go along with it and see what happens next. There may be a villain living in my subconsciousness. It's a fantasy, like eating someone alive. When you see the movie I think you gonna understand better things that... We have in our mind that we just pretend it's not there. Create your own value. Either from your intelligence, your physique, or your artistry No matter what, I always give it all and go all the way. The show must go on. As actors. Even if we're asked by the director to eat shit, come what may.
