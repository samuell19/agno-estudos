Great! Glory to Tansen! Glory to music! Disperse! Disperse! Tell the guards at the door there must be no disturbance. And listen. Tell Hathi Singh... there must beno music playing around the palace. l desire absolute silence. My heart hurts Wow! What a heart-rending note! Great! He sings so well. Seems like the clouds are thundering. The clouds are thundering! You are great! Oh great, sir. lt is you who is our Tansen. Even your coughing is musical. Bless you. Continue. Stop singing! Ghaseet Khan, stop singing! Why should l? Even l have many admirers. lf sing you must, go elsewhere. Making noise is prohibited here. Oh yes, even breathing is prohibited here. Mind your tongue! The royal singer Tansen, is preparing new tunes. Don't disturb him. l know all his tricks, Hathi Singh! He only twists the notes a little... and makes new tunes. You cannot fool me! Shut up! lf you act smart... you'll forever be forbidden from singing in this area. Only Your name is true Here comes another singer. Go and stop him. Only Your name is true ln the entire world, only Your name is true What did you bring into this world? What will you take back? You came with clenched fists You will leave with your arms spread This world is a sham. Only Your name is true Stop, sage! Singing is prohibited here! This is not a song, it is a hymn. Whatever it may be. Tansen is preparing a new tune. So as per his orders, singing and playing music is prohibited here. Music is the essence of life. There cannot be any restrictions on it ever. Only Your name is true What are you waiting for? Drive them out! Get out of here! Calm down! We are free people. Don't mess with me, guard! Stop your nonsense! Father! Son! Baiju! Father! Son, don't ever forget your father. lf ever fate grants the opportunity... do take revenge of your father's murder... from Tansen. Promise me. Promise me, son. Father! Revenge! Revenge! Revenge! That boy ran away with the sword. Take the sword from him. You thief! Spare him. Why are you hurting a child? The kid is a thief. He stole our sword. l am not a thief. l'm a learned musician's son. Have you learnt anything else apart from stealing? l have learnt all classical notes. Oh great! But why did you steal their sword? l want to avenge the murder of my father. You should not talk like that, son. On whom do you wish to take revenge for your father's murder? ln this kingdom, he is a very great ... very great... This boy is very dangerous. He should be arrested. He is immature. He had taken the wrong path out of anger and sorrow. l will guide him back to the right path. Come, son. Come. Take. That's our village, across the river Jamuna. You have a melodious voice. You immediately got a response. Where did you learn music? We lived in Chapaner village in Gujurat. My father used to sing hymns. He even had immense knowledge of music. He was taking me to Vrindavan to Haridas Swami... to complete my music training. But... Haridas Swami? Tansen's Guru? lt's okay, son. So what if you've lost your father? l'll teach you music. There comes Gauri. l always heard your music on the string instrument. How come l heard it through this boy today? Through this boy? Who was he calling just now? You answered his call. He answered your call. Hearing your voice, he forgot the sorrow of his father's death. - Come. - Come, son. l will help him overcome the sorrow of his father's death. - What's his name? - Baijnath. l'll call him Baiju. Long names help nobody in the village. What good will Baiju do? Baiju will help me row the boat. Whereas Baijnath will not even give a thought to the fact... that l must be tired rowing the boat alone. Now it'll be smooth sailing for Gauri. Be careful. Hello, Punditji. Back from Agra? And brought along this Tansen. No, no! Don't you know how to swim? Father, he only knows how to drown. ln the seas that is music, there are many who will swim, few that will dive deep. Mohan, you'll see. Like Tansen, even he will become famous. No! Not like Tansen! Oh alright, we'll forget even Tansen. Spring has arrived lt has brought along new dreams There is love in the air My heart sings with joy, my love My veil keeps falling off Spring has arrived There is love in the air Your swing sways higher than my notes lt is your string of love that sways my swing You are the joy of my life Spring has arrived There is love in the air Clouds filled with love have gathered in the sky The koyal sings, the peacock dances in the jungle We sing the song of love Spring has arrived lt has brought along new dreams Love is in the air Gauri, on the banks of the Jamuna, on this dune... we made and broke so many sand castles. Today, in our youth, dreams light up our lives. Never let the lights go out, Baiju. Sir, you have been left in the lurch. She is engaged to you, but is promising marriage to him. l won't allow that! lt's a matter of family honor! l'll have to do something! - Do what? - Speak out. What do l say now? She already has. Take. Let's go. You know the difference between a musical instrument and a baton? Shall l tell you, sir? The strings release music from the first one. And the second releases music when played on someone's head. Narpat! The strings of the musical instrument wins hearts. Whereas you can neither defeat Baiju nor win me with your baton. - Forget it, Gauri. - Look at how brazen she is! She has grown up but has no shame whatsoever. She wanders with this guy all day long. And wonder where this shameless guy has come from in our village. No one knows anything about his parents or family. When will you marry Gauri? Maybe next Spring. Wonder where she's gone. Gauri, nowadays you... The cow is giving very little milk these days. No wonder, she's going wayward. - Right? - No. No? Yes. You are no longer a child, but a grown up woman. - You understand? - What difference does it make? Mohan, keep your daughter in check. She keeps wandering around all day with Baiju. Her conduct will make the other girls of the village follow suit. All girls are not like Gauri. l'll kill them if they do that! But Mohan will surely lose face in society. You heard? This is the difference. And how did this shameless fellow end up in our village? No one even knows his caste or his family! What thoughts are you lost in? You have taken the 'Veena' after so many days. - Let me hear you sing. - The strings have broken. - They can be mended. - l've lost my notes. You've lost your notes? Then how will you become a renowned singer of the world? With your blessings, l surely will. lt's this earth that's taking my music away. Gauri, take me across the river. What are you looking for? Journey's end. There is a storm raging all around. And you've lost your way? No. l want to stay away from you. l'll send father. He'll take you across the river. You have come to the boat after so many days. - Where were you all these days? - l'd applied henna on my hands. The henna would lose color faster if l'd rowed the boat. Let me see. l want to stay away from everybody. For how long? Until you count all the stars in the sky. Stars in the sky? l finished counting. - How? lt's day time now. - Maybe for you. For me, you got annoyed, and my day darkened. Your annoyance is showing me stars during day. l understand everything. Stop flattering me. Gauri, don't stay away from me or l'll go crazy. People are right. Like Punditji, you know nothing beyond music. People lie. l know everything. - What is it? - You are my eighth note. Outside of my music, you are everything. my song is only half-sung. You are my music, Gauri. Don't give me such deep talks. l'll drown in them. You can swim, Gauri. lt is l who'll drown. A drowning man might take a swimmer down with him. Don't row alone... across the river, oh maiden We are the streams of two rivers Our union will last forever lf you are the sea, l am its wave l am the one who rows your heart's boat You will not be able to row alone You won't get to the shore without the oarsman Come back Come back surfing the waves Our union will last How will these bonds of hearts break? Waves once merged cannot separate They cannot be concealed in a whirlpool lf you try to hide, l'll find you We'll swim... We'll swim across this storm one day Our union will last We are the streams of two rivers Our union will last forever Punditji, Gauri and Baiju have become infamous. One day, he was going to avenge his father's death... with a sword in his hand. Now he has turned around. l have realized today what Baiju has that l lack. Oh yes, you have everything that he has. - So what if you are fat... - Shut up! What l lack is that l cannot sing like him. And Gauri is crazy about his music. How right you are! You hit the bulls eye! No, l'm missing the target. l will have to learn music if l want Gauri. We are the streams of two rivers Enemy! You'll have to learn to sing. Wait. Where had l...? ln Delhi? No, not Delhi. Over there? No, not there. Not there either. Now l remember! l came across renowned music teachers in Agra. They can teach you to sing. But ... but ... forget it. - What is it? - No, that... Will you tell me? What is it? - No, he won't teach you. - Who? - l know who you're talking about. - Who? - Shall l tell you? - Yes. You're talking about Tansen. Tansen is a nonentity in comparison. l'm talking of that great teacher! He is so good at playing music. Tell me his name. He doesn't have one name. His mother endearingly called him Lallu. And his father called him Ghaseetu. And the king has several names for him. The Maestro of Maestros, Creator of Music... Master of the Sarangi, Hazur Khan, Ustad Ghaseet Khan. lf that's the case, l will offer all my wealth to him. Go and bring him here. Go! My beloved is on the mountain l'm standing on the river bank below But l can't go to see him My feet are chained Gauri, won't you come to the well? You must come today. lt's the Spring festival. She doesn't step out of the house these days. Why don't you go if he's calling you? You go. He must be calling you. lf l go to meet him, you'll kill me. The poor girl is herself dying. How will she kill someone else? Poor thing. Basanti, l warn you! - What are you warning me about? - Damn you! Just you wait! The pot is empty. Wonder what she's pretending to churn. Her own heart. Don't tease me! Don't tease her! Are we teasing or is he calling out? Wait. Go and meet him. Get lost! Alright, if she's not going to him, let's bring him here. No! Someone sings these words in the distance Without you my beloved, l cannot make music The fire of love rages within my heart l feel so lost lf this is my state now... then what will happen later? l've lost my sleep. Loneliness torments me... without you my beloved My honor holds me back My feet are shackled Whenever l think of him, my heart hurts My eyes brim over and shed tears... without you my beloved Who are you looking for? l... The poor fellow is looking for something he's lost. Not here, he has lost something on the dune at the river bank. But he's come looking for it here. Then you know what l've lost? Basanti is hiding it. l'll give it to you for a reward. Damn you! You're pinching me so hard. - What do you want? - l came to ask... Father isn't home. Here's my card. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7... Greetings. Where is Ustad? Did you hear that? He's preparing a new Raga. New Raga? What Raga is that? Oh yes, the Coughing Raga. But why behind closed doors? Singing is forbidden in this area. Only the one who can sing better than Tansen can sing here. What if someone can sing better than him? We are two... He'll have to compete with Tansen. But if he is defeated, he will be beheaded. lf he wins, Tansen will lose his life. What a strange law! Who is the idiot who is talking so much? - Sir... - Do you know how it feels when you cannot compose? l know. lt's real bad. Shut up! Your nonsense broke my concentration. - What do you want? - My master is a very rich man. He wants to learn to sing from you. Damn your master! l'm not some street singer. Go ahead to Tansen's mansion if you want to learn music. l don't recognize Tansen. l follow you. The guy seems intelligent. Right? l am an acclaimed singer. - You'll get whatever you ask for. - Alright, l'll come. Arrange for two horses. ls your family coming along? You moron! l'll ride one horse, and my Sarangi rides the other. That is how l travel wherever l go. lf this is not acceptable to you, you may leave. That's Tansen's mansion. l am no ordinary singer. l am a knowledgeable singer. l am good. l have no music sense. l'll always be tuneless. Narpat, making arrangements to get married? l am waiting for Ustad Ghaseet Khan. l'll get married as soon as Ustad comes. - With Ustad? - Damn you all! Not with Ustad, but with Gauri. After l learn music. - l wonder when Ustad will come. - Next Summer. l'll be married by next Summer. He's right. Until he learns music from Ustad... Gauri will teach new Ragas to Baiju at the dunes at night. What nonsense! Gauri has stopped meeting Baiju. Only during day, not at night. At night? Where is Gauri's father? - Why? - What is it? - ls that so? - What? - Very shameful! - What? Gauri goes to meet Baiju at the dune every night. You should drown in shame! Before that, l'll kill the one who falsely accuses my daughter! Then whoever he may be! Alright, l'll take my complaint to the village committee. Let them decide this matter. Where did she go? Oh Lord - What brings you here at this hour? - Where is Baiju? He must be at the dunes on the river bank. The moment it is evening, he goes to the dunes with his 'Veena'. And returns back very late. He is concentrating so much on his practice... that he will defeat even Tansen one day, you'll see. But Punditji... Truly speaking, Gauri is the inspiration behind his success. lf l am his teacher, Gauri is his inspiration. She goes and sits with him everyday. He composes for Gauri. And Gauri inspires him to reach for the skies. That means what l have heard is true. Yes, it's true. Absolutely true. l myself have seen them there several times. You have? But who will stop the villagers from talking? What reply will l give the village committee? l'll have to get Gauri married soon ... to Narpat. Gauri is already married. - To Baiju. - Baiju? Yes. Baiju is a composer, Gauri his music. Baiju is a singer, Gauri is his song. Baiju is the melody, Gauri his 'veena'. And where Gauri is his music, Baiju is her crescendo. Their union has been brought about by the Creator... who promotes selfless, pure love. Accept this as a marriage, Mohan. No one can separate the two now. The village committee can. l have already given my word to Narpat. You'll have to pay a fine for breaking your promise. But if you try to take the light away from the lamp... the lamp will be extinguished. The light will be no more. There will be darkness everywhere. l'll pay the fine, l will! Gauri is the light of my life, and Baiju the light of hers. No one can separate them now. Where are you going so late at night? - You? - Yes, it's me. Caught you today. What have you lost on this dune? You have lost your senses to have gone and told father... that l go to meet Baiju at the dune every night. He is looking for me carrying a sword in his hand. l'll leave the village and run away. Listen! Gauri, wait! l am such a fool! l was influenced by the villagers' gossip. Come Gauri, let's go and convince your father. No! He'll kill you. He's probably coming this way. We've reached the village, Ustad. This is called Agra door. Wait. My master's house is not far from here. - Burn down that house! - Why? He's a cad and a knave! lmpudent ass! Who are you abusing, sir? lt was your master's duty to come and welcome me... on the outskirts of the village... and salute me. l am not the kind to go and salute someone. l am no ordinary singer. l am a knowledgeable singer. My master must not have expected you at this late hour. Don't you know that l arrived in the world at a late hour. And go everywhere at a late hour. Don't talk of going, sir. l'll inform my master while you water the horses. l'll return soon. Gauri ... listen ... Don't be angry. - But Narpat... - Listen. lf your father comes, tell him you came to hear me sing. l'll set everything right. Hear me sing. Do you know what this called? 'Sarkari Kangra'. Listen. Why did the girl go crazy? Who is the idiot who is singing so tunelessly? Who is that? You ass! Asses don't sing. Put that down! Don't murder music! You old man! l'll thrash you! - You ox! - You called me an ox? Even you called me an ass. You are a tuneless, stupid ass! You impudent, stupid fellow! Go away! Or l'll hang you up side down! You brazen fellow! Wonder where they come from uninvited! Father gave his consent! Oh God! What calamity has befallen me! Present 2000 coins before our chief. Or we will burn down the whole village! Only last year, you took 2000 coins from us. We will come every year to claim this tax. Tax? We pay taxes to King Man Singh every year. How can we pay taxes to two people? Say whatever you want to our chief. One who can force it out of you, taxes are his! Present 2000 coins! Or the moment l fire, my people will go on a looting spree. Have mercy. Please reduce this amount. Those who rob don't make deals. Where do we get such a huge sum from? Oh looters of the poor Loot the heart's love instead Love is that precious wealth... in comparison to which, every other wealth is worthless Practice humanity Practice humanity. Do something good You will leave but your name behind in this world Even the sunrise is gloomy here Even dew sheds tears seeing the flowers here There is some joy and some sorrow here Where are you lost? Awaken! Think of the consequences Many come here in all their glory They throw their weight around... forgetting they are just guests in this world Some come... Some come, some leave this world every day Practice humanity Why have you spread terror? You can't carry any wealth with you when you die, so why loot? Why torture the poor? You commit sin... You commit sin and Satan earns disgrace Practice humanity Wonderful! Bravo, son! A guru must get a pupil like you! A pupil so good at music! What is it? You invited Ghaseet Khan from Agra to tutor under him. Let me finish. What was l saying? ln a year or two, you'll be able to compete with Tansen. l agree that you succeeded in deterring us from our mission. l will accept l've been successful... only if you and your men leave without looting the village. l'll accept even that. But on one condition. What condition? You will have to come with me. - l'll have to come with you? - lt's not a costly proposition. You have saved your village from ruin at a very small cost. What are you thinking? You have gained everything. lt's l who has lost something. Tell me, do you accept the condition? Yes! No Baiju! No! No Baiju! l will never let you go! Plunder the village! We aren't staying here forever! Wait! l am coming with you. No! You cannot go! - l'll have to go, Gauri. - Never! No Baiju! You will not go. Please make her understand. l'll return soon. Let him go. He is saving the entire village today. Father! Don't worry, dear. l am confident Baiju will come back. But l could not say what l wanted to. Father, gather courage. And give me your blessings. Son. Baiju! Baiju, listen. Gauri, l will return soon. Mount! Even though we are separating... do not forget our childhood love When you think about me... pray that we meet soon You are leaving me alone and lonely in my house of hope As you leave you are taking away the hope of love we shared The sorrow you are giving me, pray for that sorrow When the bird sings during the rain, l will think of you l will sing my complaints of separation for you When you hear me singing, l hope you feel a stirring in your heart Even though we are separating... do not forget our childhood love When you think about me... pray that we meet soon Will you talk to me for a few moments? - Who are you? - Don't you recognize my voice? l don't think it necessary to recognize your voice. Do try to acknowledge this voice once. - What do you want? - Just a song. Music that will reverberate through the emptiness of my life. ln my songs is a calm that will contain the storms of life. Not songs that raise a storm. Singer ... leave that decision to me. l know what storms lie hidden in your songs. lf my songs can bring storms... first build bastions to withstand the storms. Don't insult my love like this. ln this world, there is nothing stronger than a woman's heart. Maybe, but why should that bother you? You are no woman. You are a dacoit, a brute, a monster! ls that all you see in my eyes right now? The one who loots people, cannot win hearts. Take your ill intentions with you and leave from here! l neither have a song, nor any wealth that l can give you. l am not a plunderer. lt's not my profession to loot people. Your village was my father's estate. King Man Singh seized it from us. My father was killed. l was orphaned. l was raging with anger. l picked up the sword and vowed... that l would avenge my father's death! Father! Father! Baiju, if you get the opportunity... do take revenge for your father from Tansen! Revenge! Revenge! What did l say that hurt you so much? Tell me. Did l make some mistake? - No. l had forgotten. - What? Even l want to seek vengeance! That's my life's main goal! Gauri's affection made me forget my duty. You reminded me of it today. The village girl who l cannot forget despite your wooing me. That love has been replaced by vengeance now. - Vengeance? - Yes. From Gauri, l picked up the fragrance of love. From you, l have taken a razor-sharp resolve. Gauri is like a flower, whereas you are a sword. You could not have given me anything better. Are you using this as an excuse to go to Gauri? lf l am alive, l will surely go to meet her one day. But right now, l just want to forget about her love. Father's voice of vengeance is calling out to me. - Let me go! - Then take me along. - Maybe l can help you. - No, l will fulfill my duty. Stop Baiju. He is leaving. But wait! Let him go. An artist cannot stay in bonds. Who are you? l have come to behead you! You are lying. lf you wanted to behead me, you would have beheaded me. Why did you destroy my instrument? What did you achieve by doing that? Your music had begun to deter me from my mission. lt had begun to lure my sword. Oh. You have a heart that understands music. Music doesn't belong only to you, Tansen! Music may not belong to me, but it surely is my life. l will not die by your sword. lf you have decided to kill me... sing out the pathos in your soul. Tansen will die just hearing it. Sir! Who is this crazy man? What do we do with him? Should we behead him? Only the heart is allowed to bleed in this house. That too, because music demands it. Then what punishment have you decided for him? His punishment is that he live for years to come. And be hurt by life again and again. Escort him out as you would a guest. But young man... you didn't tell me why you wanted to kill me. What is the point in telling you now? You will know when the time comes. And that time will surely come! Music filled with pain. Bring music filled with pain. But from where? From the high mountains? Or flowing streams? From the dry deserts? But no. You cannot attain wisdom without a Guru. Only a diamond can cut a diamond. The diamond that was polished at the hands of Swami Haridas. Baba, people say that this world, which is God's creation... is full of music. l tried learning music from every creation of God. But now l have come into your fold. Because no one can attain knowledge without a teacher. And without knowledge, man cannot fulfill his desire. What is your desire, son? l want to learn music and take revenge from someone. Revenge with the help of music? - Yes. - You're making a mistake, son. Music relates heart to heart.. lt elevates the soul. lt turns hatred to love. Music doesn't extoll revenge. But l do want to take revenge! That too, with the help of music! As long as you have the desire for vengeance in your heart... you can never learn music. To learn music, one needs to have love in his heart. Rather than hurt others, generate pathos in your own heart. Love and pathos l have forgotten. lf you don't take me as your pupil, l'll die at your doorstep. Son, fire cannot extinguish fire. lt needs water to extinguish it. Darkness cannot eliminate darkness. Light eliminates darkness. Hatred cannot be overcome with hate, but with love. l am giving you my symbol of love. Take, play this 'veena'. When its music moves your heart strings... and brings peace to your heart... then come to me. l'll impart whatever l have to you. God... l've heard the entire creation revolves around the three notes of 'aum'. This is the first sound of the universe. lt is from these three notes man derived the seven notes of music. l want to immerse myself in these seven notes. But in the fires in my heart all seas are dried up. l didn't get anything from the world. My Guru spurned me. l have come to you now. There is only you and me here. Either l will melt your heart of stone with my music today... or l will kill myself. But even after l die, my ashes will wait for that day... when you will recreate me from those ashes... and l will still tell you to give me the knowledge of music! We are the streams of two rivers Our union will last forever Our union will last forever. Where is that union? Baiju, where are you? Here, at this very spot, you had showered me with love. This is where you'd made promises to me. Have you forgotten all of those? Don't feel dejected, son. l may be away from you... but l am always with you. Get up, son. Sing. This is 'Lalit'. The bird sings How do l hold myself back? This is 'Gaur Malhar'. The rains falls joyously My heart craves without her This is 'Puria'. l saw your glory in Your creation, oh God ln gardens, in jungles, in the blue skies l see Your glory in it all This is 'Bhageshree'. How do l come back, my beloved? Your love puts hurdles in my way Father! Father! You're back! Father, any... What your craving, searching eyes are asking... you cannot ask with words. The one who l have been looking for in vain... who became a dream even for me... with what words do l give you hope for it? Punditji... - Mohan... - l have heard everything. l heard Narpat had called the village committee for a hearing? - Yes. - What decision was taken? The village committee expressed gratitude to Baiju. But also says that one's daughter is not a trophy to be won. They say Gauri's engagement with Narpat cannot be broken. Not even on paying a fine? What can be achieved by paying a fine? Where is Baiju with who people link my daughter and disgrace her? lf l break her engagement with Narpat... and even Baiju doesn't turn up... then who will marry her? lf l die without getting my daughter married... l will not be able to face even God. She herself is responsible for her disrepute. And now she's crying over it. You only tell me Punditji, should l console her... or shut people up? Her tears will not allow me to do what is right. Have patience, Mohan. Man desires several things... but ultimately, what happens is what God wills. Come. Come inside. Had l known this... that love gives only pain... l'd have declared to the whole village... that no one must fall in love My beloved has forgotten me He'd said he'd come today, but he hasn't returned yet He hasn't even bothered to inquire about me Why did he cause so much pain... and destroy the palace of our dreams? Oh heartless soul, after giving me hope... why did you turn your eyes away from me? My beloved has forgotten me Crying and saying we know... that love is nothing but a dream Love is false and so is the lover The whole world is a sham My beloved has forgotten me Baiju, you did not return. And the people here decided my fate. But l will break this decision, this bond. Here, at this very place... l used to wallow in the elixir of love. Today, at this very place, l am consuming poison. You! lt was you who took my Baiju! Tell me! Where is my Baiju? Has he also come along with you? No. He left long ago. - Where? - Some say he went towards Agra. Some say a vagrant named Baiju roams the streets of Vrindavan. Some say he has become a disciple of Haridas Baba... and is serving him. l was going to look for him there when l heard... the village committee has decided to get you married. Baiju had termed my love immoral and rejected it. l have come here today to answer that accusation. You came to ridicule my love? No, l have come to help you. One day, l'd shooed away a bird singing in the garden of love. Now if l let that garden wither, that bird will never return. You will have to live for your Baiju. l have come to take you to him. Come with me. - But... - Don't you want to go to your Baiju? Then trust me and just come along. Come. Come on. Oh Lord, please cure Gurudev's feet soon. They are craving to come to your door, Oh Lord. Who are you looking for? What do you want? l want to meet Guru Haridas. His legs have become stiff. He cannot move around. He hasn't even been able to come to the Lord's temple... for many days. And you want to trouble him? There is no cause for worry. Apply this ointment and walk a little daily. Physician, l cannot even get off the bed. And you're asking me to walk? Until today, unless l had visited the temple... l wouldn't even drink water. And today, l am craving to see the Lord. My heart craves to see you Nothing goes right when you are not with me l plead with you, hear my prayer My heart craves to see you l am a seeker at your door When will you honor me with your blessings? Hear my ardent prayer My heart craves to see you How can l gain knowledge without a Guru? lf you bless me, l'll sing in praise of you You grant your blessings to every seeker My heart craves to see you Oh Lord, don't break my heart today Don't leave my side, oh Lord Grant me an appearance l have come to polish my talent under you, Gurudev. l can sing notes, but l see nothing beyond that. Show me light. Son, your music... that helped my yearning eyes see God... with His blessings... you will become famous in the world of music. - Baba! - Son. Son, the music you have been learning for so many years... is coming of age now. That's been possible only with your blessings, Gurudev. No, Baiju. The one l thought to be a worthless stone... turned out to be a true diamond. l only took initiative and polished it. l made it shine, gave it lustre. But the light within was a boon from God. l'll be right back. Until then, you sit and practice the Todi to perfection. Alright. The time has arrived, father. l will avenge you! You still haven't got over your obsession of taking revenge? Leave the avenging to God, son. lt is His job. You forget everything else and concentrate on your practice. The time has arrived, father. l will avenge you! Oh God, let even my heart be unmoved like Yours. Let it be unmoved! Oh my beloved O my Lord Oh Creator of this melodious world, You exist in every note. Yet, on hearing my music, You remain unmoved. Without love, music is soulless. lt is love that takes one close to God. And love has returned to you, Baiju. Don't reject love. God is love. No! Oh God, what do l do? Guide me! God! God! Gauri, leave! - Go away, Gauri! - Where do l go? No one but you can embrace me! And l will have my recognition only after you marry me. Marrying you now will be akin to making you a widow. The one l want to take revenge from, if he defeats me... l'll be beheaded. - Revenge? From whom? - From Tansen. From Tansen? How? By defeating him in music. l can marry you only after defeating Tansen. Do you have the power to defeat a great musician like Tansen? l'd rather die than break the promise given to my father. lf l survive, l'll return to you. But until then, assume l'm dead. No, Baiju! l have found you again with great difficulty. l won't let you go anywhere now. Come back with me. Have you forgotten that hill, that swing, that river, everything? lt was on that hill l forgot the promise given to my father. Gauri, go back! Where can l go leaving you? l had surrendered my life. You are my lifeline now. Accept me into your life. lf we have to face ruin, we'll face it together. No. lf you're with me, l'll forget my life's biggest duty. lt is you who put a hurdle in my music practice. You and your love will be the cause of my death. l will never be able to defeat Tansen. Gurudev, l'll go mad! l'll go mad, Gurudev! That is why l have come to give you a last piece of advice. Give up your feelings of vengeance... and fill your heart with love. Without love, there won't be pathos in your heart. And without pathos, your music... will not be able to melt stones. And pathos will generate in your heart... only when you are hurt. Hurt? lt would have been better if l'd died. Love... Pain... Love... What happened to you, Gauri? What happened to you? How could this have happened! l have removed myself from your path. Why did you do that? Now nothing lies between you and your music. You'll be able to defeat Tansen now. No! l will not let you die! lnstead of that, bind me in your love. The pain of losing your love... will make your music... immortal. We'll meet again... in heaven. God! God! What have you done, God? Answer me! She's sleeping. She won't talk to you. She will not talk to anyone in the world. She will only talk to me. - What happened to Gauri - Snake! Move! Run away! lt seems she has been bit by a snake. - By a snake? - Yes. Yes, l remember now. A snake had bit her. This snake bit her! lt was she who separated us! You've come here again to separate us! No Baiju, it was l who brought Gauri here. No, you only brought her body here. What do l do with her body? l'm going in search of her. Come to your senses! Where are you going? Leave me! Even l will die with Gauri. - No, Baiju. - Why? Aren't you satisfied yet? Then cremate that body and sprinkle the ash over yourself... and dance with abandon! Dance! ln the fight between heart and brain, he lost his brains. Baiju has gone mad! He has become mentally deranged! Laugh! Laugh, Oh God! l am crying. lt won't be right to delay. We must take her immediately. - But Baiju? - There's no time for him now. We'll come later to collect him. Oh Lord, oh Lord, oh Lord Oh protector of the world, hear my pain filled plea You created this world with both hope and despair You also created a storm of meeting with separation l saw your wickedness The village of my love has been taken away. Shed a tear Oh protector of the world, hear my pain filled plea The rain is scorching like a fire, and flowers seem to be only thorns This lovely night has become as a poisonous snake All support has crumbled Take back the life You've given me Oh protector of the world The crazy sun is searching for the moon Night is searching for the morn l am looking for that beloved one who has not become mine Oh God, may you be blessed My destiny has been shattered and there is no hope Oh protector of the world He's come! My disciple has come! Where has this mad man come from? He seems to be someone crazy. Don't you know the law of this land? Someone stop him! Continue to sing! The palace is dejected, the streets desolate, the walls all silent As the heart broke, the world was shattered How can we live this life? A temple destroyed can be rebuilt again... but can a broken heart ever be mended again? Oh protector of the world, hear my pain filled plea Stop singing! You want to die? - You'll be killed! - Stop that song! Don't you know, singing is prohibited here. l don't know. l don't know anything. l am not singing either. lt is someone else singing within me. He's not in my control. You can stop him if you can. But no! Let him sing. We need to hear his woeful plea. Let the heart pour out. Let me also cry. And along with me, the sky, earth, walls, houses, everything. Very good, Baiju! Sing! Turn towards the mansion and sing. Honestly, there is more pain in your voice than before. Why are you staring at me like that, Hathi Singh? He is my pupil! No ordinary fellow this. He is your pupil? Didn't you warn him... that only the one who can sing better than Tansen can sing here? Or he is punished with death. Then let the one who has the courage stand in competition! lt will be clear as to who is the better one! ls that so? Then arrest him too! Why are you arresting me? lt is he who will sing. Come! Did you hear me? lf you don't compete with Tansen... we both will be hanged to death. We'll be sent to the gallows. We'll be killed. What have l got myself into? This crazy fellow doesn't even answer me. How do l answer, Gauri? People have forbidden me from singing. They haven't forbidden you from singing. They are asking you to sing! Understand! You will have to sing before King Akbar. No, l will not sing before anyone now. l will sing only for Gauri. l am not Gauri, l am Ghaseetu. Look at this beard. - Are you a magician? - Magician? Turn me into a moth. l want to burn in this flame. Oh my God, l'm not going to survive now. Gauri has left. What are these noises? The gallows are being readied. Oh my God! Baiju, come! l have come to release you. She is the same dacoit! You will take him away and l'll get killed! Keep quiet! Or even you will be killed like the soldiers. Baiju, my selected men are waiting outside for me. Baiju, what wrong with you? We cannot stay here for long. Baiju! Come with me. No. Once earlier, too, you told me to come with you. Don't go, Baiju. She is fooling you. But this time, l have come to take you to Gauri. You are a lair! Gauri is waiting for me in the other world Will you take me to her? Not in that world, in this world. Gauri is alive. We took Gauri to a man who removes snake venom. - And he... - You are lying! No Baiju, l am speaking the truth! l had gone to give you the news in the temple ruins. But l didn't find you there. lts true she's alive. Yet she is saying that she doesn't exist for you. And that you shouldn't be told she's alive. Or her sacrifice will have been in vain. That you want to defeat Tansen... but she's a hindrance to your goal. Yes, that's what she said. Gauri is alive! She's gone to her village. And you've come to tell me. So that l can meet her? That shouldn't have happened, but that's what the heart desires. That heart which you thought to be useless. l think someone is coming! Come Baiju, don't delay! She's the leader of the dacoits! Capture her! Come! She's been wanted for ages. Got her now! - Where are you going? - Home with you. This is your home. - Let me go! - Get in! - Let me go! Get in! Let me go! Gauri is alive! Let me go! Baiju! Baiju! Baiju! Where did he come from? He brings my daughter to disgrace, and me to dishonour! Come the time to marry her, he absconds! The rogue! - Father! - Shut up! Don't you feel ashamed to raise your voice with me! All this is your doing! Without a thought, you did whatever you wanted! The marriage has been fixed for the next full moon. l made an excuse and quashed the issue right there. Or people would say... that hearing the decision of the village heads... l plotted your escape from the village. You didn't even care for my honor! That is why l am back. lt would have been better if you'd died. What do l do? Even death has shunned me. Now you only kill your daughter. l will kill myself not you. That is, if you don't marry Narpat. - But... - But what? You still want to wait for that fool? Shankaranand is tired of looking for him. But was he found? Even you had gone to search for him. But did you find him? Then forget about him. You have just two options before you. Marriage to Narpat, or the death of your father. This is my final decision! Gauri is alive. Open the door. The door of destiny doesn't open time and again. When she came to get us released... you were too lost to pay attention. Now you'll be able to meet Gauri... only if you sing to defeat Tansen. Yes, l will have to sing! Oh God, fill my voice with such melodious notes... that l'm able to fulfill my promise given to my father. And am able to get Gauri. l will sing! l will sing! Wow! Great! Excellent! ln my opinion, this competition isn't yet over. Tansen, l, the king, ordered... you to sing the Todi to attract the deer. Young singer, even you did just that. But you haven't yet shown any miracle of music... that proves you to be a better singer than Tansen. Oh King, if l may speak without fear... may l say something? Proceed. King, my pupil may look crazy. But he has such pain in his voice that can melt even stone to water My request is that my pupil and Tansen... sing the same Raga together. And then it be decided whose notes have the power... to melt stoned hearts. l like the idea. And l am sure even Tansen will agree. Baijnath, if you get defeated in this competition... do you know what the consequences will be? l do, King. Death. - But what if l win? - You'll get whatever you ask. And Tansen... Will be punished with death, King. Of course. The law plays no favorites. A marble piece has been placed in a glass bowl filled with water. My patience is wearing thin. Oh great artists, prove today... that the melting of stone from the effects of music... is not just hearsay. lt is a fact. Begin the competition. l will sing Your praises, oh Lord Make my ravaged destiny l will sing Your praises, oh Lord Make my ravaged destiny My heart sings joyously today... in your praises, Oh Lord lf l'm defeated, l'll lose my life lf l win, l'll gain the world Keep my honor intact My heart sings joyously today The lover sings for his love Trying to melt stone with his notes To keep my respect in society My heart sings joyously today ln the melodious union of the seven notes... create magic Oh Lord of Baiju's music... light fire in water My heart sings joyously today Wonderful! Bravo, son! You have saved your Guru's honor today. May God bless you. Wonderful! Excellent! Tansen, l suspect your string didn't break, you broke it. Play again. Oh King, l cannot conceal my defeat by blaming my instrument. An instrument is a support to music. Not its reason for defeat. Baijnath, l acknowledge your victory. Tansen, l regret your defeat. Oh King, in my defeat lies the victory of music. The King, Tansen, the whole of Hindustan be happy today. That an invaluable diamond has been found in the chest of music. Whose sparkle will illuminate the world of music forever. You are absolutely right. The sign of this diamond illuminated my court today. l am highly impressed by your miracle, singer. Ask for something from me. lf the King permits, l ask for only three things. You have my permission. One is the freedom of music from the bonds of law. Secondly, the release of Roopmati... and the return of her territory. And thirdly, life to music. Life to music? l don't understand. The life of music is Tansen. Oh King, grant Tansen life and save music from death. You have the soft heart of an artist, Baijnath. But the law is heartless. The foundations of law are based on mercy, King. l plead for that mercy. Your attitude continues to impress me. The light that granted me new life... with the lamination of music... whose sheen lit up a thousand lamps... how can l watch his ruin, King? You are a true artist, Baijnath. l cannot help but praise your humility. Your talent, and your attitude has forced me today... to sacrifice law for the sake of humanity. Your petitions are granted. Hail Baijnath! Yes, that's my Baiju's voice! Basanti, did you hear? My Baiju is back! Baiju, you're back! Yes uncle, l'm back. You have come at the right time. Gauri is getting married today. - Gauri is getting married? - Yes. Uncle, take me to the other side immediately. Even l could not go today. The river is too rough. How can l take you across? Our boat will sink. My life's desires are sinking! l will have to go! - Punditji, Baiju is back. - Baiju? Baiju is back? My Baiju is back! Bring the bride. Don't take the boat into the raging river. So you helped her escape! Where is Gauri?! You have no shame, but we are respectable people. Tell us, shameless fellow! Shame on you! Don't sail that boat, it will capsize in the storm. - What are you doing! - Let go, Punditji! - Don't be crazy. - Let go! Gauri is drowning. have you won the contest, Baiju? Yes Gauri, but l'm losing the battle for my life! You won't be able to save me, Gauri. - Go back to shore. - l have found my shore. You know how to swim. Swim back to safety. l may know how to swim, yet l'd rather drown with you. ln the waters then, we are to wed, Gauri! We are the streams of two rivers Our union will last forever How will these bonds of hearts ever break? Waves once merged cannot separate They cannot be concealed in a whirlpool lf you try to hide, we'll find you
