This is a story that begins like a fairy tale. Once upon a time in Venice, many years ago, there lived a very wise Jew and a young handsome nobleman, to which the old teacher tried to pass on his ancient wisdom. Those... those ants down there at the end of the lagoon are human beings and they're building a ship. The people here in Venice, especially sailors, look at them suspiciously, with hostility. And you know why? Because those carpenters are using new construction systems that nobody has ever seen in Venice. They learned to tie the planking of the ship in a new way. Things are changing, many things are changing, Marco. Yes, but not for me. When I returned from the port where I had observed their work, I engraved the date on that window. May 12, 1271. On that day I realized it was the end of an era. - So much the better! It was old. - And you are young. While your teacher explains things, what do you do? You play with your dagger! An absurd exercise with the only result of possibly injuring you. Marco, be serious! Listen, and believe me when I say that man is changing the world. I wasted my last years teaching a young boy. Your father, in leaving for China, asked me to teach you what I know, and I wasn't successful. - No, it's not true. The little good there is in me, I owe to you. I'm no longer a boy and I angrily see the world slipping from my hands. Even if your father should return with a ship full of gold, it won't be his riches to give you the world. You must conquer it! How? People say that my father is ruined, that he was lost at sea. - I am nobody in Venice. - You're Marco Polo, 20 years old. Venice is not the world. You know what the banker Spinello says against us? - Let him speak. - I won't! I won't allow anyone to speak badly of my father. No one! I can't do much, but I can silence Spinello! - Look here. You're the only creature in the world that I really love. For you I engraved those notches on my splendid astrolabe. They mark the position of all the stars in the sky, during the hour of your birth. - What do the stars predict for me? I told you hundreds of times. Glory... and prison. Two things that often go hand in hand. But you start with conquering glory. Where are you going now? Not to conquer glory, but maybe to prison. I'm playing chess with Spinello. The bankers must understand that other things exist besides those recorded in their books. - For example, Marco? - Honor! - Good-day, Mr. Spinello! - Good-day. Did you hear the news? At dawn, the Cape Kormakitis lookout spotted a ship. Its form and mast look like it could be my father's ship, San Marco. It's racing in front of the wind with its sails unfurled! Don't make me laugh. The man who was a lookout must have been drunk. What if it's true, and the San Marco docks tomorrow in the lagoon with a precious cargo of perfumes from Arabia, Persian carpets, and soft silks from China? I would laugh at you. Right? My dear boy, if this were true, I'd be the first to be pleased with all my heart, for a thousand reasons. You understand me! But believe me, the Cape Kormakitis lookout is a drunkard. But then, on the horizon, a small dot appeared. It was far away and as it approached, it took on the form of a ship with the sails in the wind, racing towards Venice. It was truly the San Marco taking back to the mother country Marco's father and uncle. But with his great disappointment, the holds were empty. The long awaited riches had not arrived. All the merchandize from the faraway Orient had been confiscated by Byzantium, at war with Venice. Niccolò Polo and his brother Matteo were ruined. Destiny, politics and war are things that creditors understand very well, but they aren't reasons for not being paid. Very soon the two Polo brothers, sitting at a table, found themselves fighting against a horde of creditors. We can only offer you our word. But I know that for the merchants of Venice it means nothing. That envelope that we bring can only be unsealed by the Pope. But I can assure you that the proposals of the Emperor of China can change the entire future of Christianity. Let's forget about the future of Christianity. And let's talk about the 250,000 ducats you owe us. Without a doubt you will not pay. So I ask for confiscation of all your assets until we see, lined up along the piers, as much merchandize as it takes to pay your debts. But it was written that fortune was to smile again at the Polos. As you saw, I didn't say anything, but I know something that the others don't know yet. A new pope was elected. Gregorio of Piacenza. Gregorio of Piacenza? Then we are saved! - If the tiara hasn't changed him. - That's right, but Gregorio, before becoming pope, was your friend. I don't see why he should deny his affection now. Here, take it. There is some gold for you. I am sure you'll need it. Take the message of the emperor to the pope, and if the Orient opens its door to us, we'll make excellent deals. - The mice are getting back on board. - It is usually an excellent sign. - Alright. We'll divide it in three. - Yes, we're good friends. Let's not get our hopes up too much. He was our friend as a bishop. Now we must talk to him as a pope, and that is very different. He held Marco on his lap. He surely hasn't forgotten that. - You are lovely. - Thank you. I am beginning to like this city. I'm not surprised. I heard that during my absence all you did was chase girls. I don't deny it, but it's not totally true. Sometimes I didn't have to chase them. Don't kidnap Roman women while your uncle and I are with His Holiness. I don't doubt the sincerity of the Polo brothers, but I fear their simplicity. My advisor is convinced that the Emperor of China is preparing a war against Christianity. Father Vincent, Koublai Khan only wants peace. His message is proof of this. He just wants to chase our doubts away while he prepares war. We received precise information of what is happening in China. There is a faction that's pro war, but the emperor is blocking it. He could change his mind. He asked to send priests to teach Christianity. In exchange, he promises help for liberation of the Holy Sepulcher. It's a trick, holy Father. I think that Koublai Khan is really against war, and is waiting for a word from us to strengthen his position. We will give it to him. It is very important that our benevolent attitude reach him as soon as possible. Niccolò, Matteo, you know him. He trusts you. Take my message of hope and good will to him. I will send two Templar priests with you for spiritual matters. Marco will take care of the rest. Marco? Why Marco? The pope wanted to see Marco. What was the secret thought of this wise and cautious man? The Emperor of China asked him for 100 wise men to teach the ways of the Western world and the Christian religion, made of tenderness and love. The Pope knew he couldn't find 100 wise me in all of Rome, but when young Marco was facing him, the Pope was struck by his audacious aspect and by his honest and loyal look, and an idea came to his mind. An idea that scandalized the Christian world at that time. Later is was said that he had been inspired by the Holy Spirit, and that God had spoken to his heart. Since he didn't have 100 wise men, why not send only one man, the most courageous, the most handsome he could find? Me, holy Father? The Pope looked at Marco and smiled, thinking that youth and beauty are the smile of God on Earth and can obtain more than 100 wise men with all their wisdom. Guess who! - How long will you be away? - 5, 10, 15 years. Who knows? Where were you? It's already time to sail! I went to say goodbye to my teachers. So, because of Pope Gregorio's strange decision, on a November morning in 1271, the Silk Road opened in front of a 20 year old Venetian. Marco didn't know that he would return when half of his life had gone by. His first landing was in the Holy Land. Welcome, my friends! Your last trip was very fruitful. You have come back soon. You're fortunate because I've the loveliest slaves of the Orient. We want to buy camels and horses. I have horses and camels, the most beautiful in all the Orient. Pure breed Arab horses, as fast as the wind, and camels capable of crossing all deserts. Already the news of this mysterious caravan had spread throughout the Orient. Apparently the Pope's messengers were being spied and followed along the entire road to China. - Uncle, watch over my father. - Don't worry. Go ahead. I'll join you immediately! Understand? While the caravan was on its way towards Samarkand. Marco and the two Templars headed towards an oasis where they would meet another two Templars from Jerusalem to give them an ampoule of holy oil to donate to the emperor of China. The idea of this gift had seemed sacrilegious to Pope Gregorio's contemporaries. Putting into the hands of a pagan the holy symbol of Christianity would expose it to a horrible profanation. The Pope imagined that this risk could reach the emperor's heart. Two merchants taken from their affairs, two poor priests, and an inexperienced young man is what the Pope found to conquer China. Good-day, maiden. Jesus was alone, and his apostles were 12 barefoot men. We'll be caught like mice halfway along the road. If it will be necessary, we will know how to die. The Templars were seriously perplexed in seeing Marco chase all the lovely girls that he met, forgetting the seriousness of the mission entrusted to him. They didn't doubt the Pope's wisdom in choosing a young man for such an important mission, but anguishing problems tormented their Templar serenity. Meanwhile, the Polo brothers had reached the desert area, under the domain of Alau, a powerful Arab head, with which they had made friends on their previous trips. Vile disgusting jackal! You're stupider than a crazy camel! Silence! Don't ever come into my tent during the siesta hour. Understand? - Niccolò Polo is coming. - Niccolò, my beloved brother! Why didn't you tell me right away? Round up the men and tell the women to get ready for a big celebration. Run, go on! Wake up! Everyone on your hoses. The master's orders! - You are leaving again? - Don't be upset, my sweetness. Niccolò is a brother. It would be an offence not to go greet him. - I am never with my husband. - What? I am with you every Saturday night. Isn't it proof that I love you? If you really loved me, you'd chase away your other wives. They're unimportant. I keep them because it's the custom. I love you. My father was happy with only 3 wives and my uncle only has 2. While you have 26. 26? I told you, it's the custom. I don't want you to have lots of wives besides me! But the road that Marco Polo and his companions took was not covered with stars and lovely girls. Their journey was followed by sinister figures dressed in black. Death and destruction were the result of whoever dared rebel against his will. The tyrant knew about the mission entrusted to Marco and his companions and also knew they were in his territory. Are you Venetians? Yes, merchants. My master, who everyone calls the Old Mountain Man, offers you hospitality. - The Old Mountain Man? - I thought it was a legend. - You'll see if it's a legend! We are grateful for his invitation, but are in a hurry. Maybe we'll stop on the way back. The village you passed disobeyed the Old Mountain Man. Come, it is not difficult. Let's move! One of us by go by! Don't move! Pig! Don't provoke. At times, real courage is that of knowing how to submit. You, who fought for Christ all your life, say that? Yes. So, will you decide to accept our gracious invitation? If you want me to come with you, you'll have to force me. Get him! Remember, the master wants him alive, if it's possible. Why don't you come get me? Must I lose my patience? Coward! You hide behind the backs of your men. Come get me, if you dare! - Let him go! - Marco, the dagger! You were right. Real courage would have been giving in. I always dreamed of dying for the glory of Christ, not for yours. You seem perturbed, brother. Aren't you happy to see me again? - Marco should've come yesterday. - He'll arrive tonight or tomorrow. Nothing happened to him, or I would've been informed. Come freshen up. I sent my men to look for Marco. Even if he's late, he'll join you. Tomorrow you'll leave as planned. Marco is bright. He'll manage to join us one way or another. Stop worrying, Niccolò. In my territory he is as safe as a child in his mother's arms. Eat. A big celebration was prepared for you. The royal palace of the Old Mountain Man where Marco and his companions were taken, was an immense palace cut inside the rock. The site had a sinister reputation in all of the Orient. It was known that inside there were magnificent riches, rare animals, a library that had no equals, and beautiful women that the Old Mountain Man had kidnapped from the four corners of the world. According to the legend, this genius of evil who only believed in the denial of every truth and every moral, had no age or name, and it was said he was immortal. His face was covered by a golden mask that he only removed in front of those who were destined to die. He secretly chose his successor. He would have worn the golden mask one day, and in following the same principles of evil denial of anything good, he would have acquired the right to life and death on all the realm. Aristotle. Plato. You said he was an evil and cruel monster. I still say it. He is the human incarnation of all evil on the earth. How is it possible that evil flourishes among books of so much wisdom? Each man takes from books the truth that he prefers. This is a truth, too. Why are you wearing a mask? Let me see your face. Don't worry, you'll see it before you wish doing so. There are many ways to descend a stairway, but there is only one way to climb the stairway that leads to paradise. You have an ordinary and vulgar face, one of a common fatso. You're the insolent type of man that I very much like. And you, the sly type that I detest. I like you. I'd be glad if you decided to stay with me spontaneously, without having to convince you. Do you like me too? Admit it. If you want me to be your friend, let us go. You worry about your holy pilgrim who you consider a guardian of your faith and your conscience. A useless being. Very soon you will thank the Old Mountain Man for the great gift he's about to give you. I'll show you that the faith they've shoved into your head since you were a child, is only one of illusions. Yes. I want to show you because I like you very much. - I'd rather you didn't like me. - It's an instinctive emotion. Your Christian friends think they are so strong as to transform a piece of bread into the body of a god. I will show you that the faith preached by this holy man is nothing more than a lie. Yes, it's a disgusting lie. Pray. Pray, pray. You can obtain a lot more by inhaling hashish. Just one caress from brother pain and he will deny his faith as one denies an unsuitable bride. If you touch even one hair of that man, you'll have to kill me. No. Nobody will touch him. He must only listen to a bell, and nothing else. Christians like to listen to the sound of bells. Isn't that so? Enough! Stop! To show you how little is left of his faith, I'll ask him to spit on his God. It's much easier and faster than questioning him on the sincerity of convictions that he nurtures in his heart. Leave him alone! This is the force of the faith you were raised with. I learned something from you today. I am very grateful. I realized what it means to love my fellow men, even if weak and malicious. I will soon test what you call a great love. Your terrestrial glory is just an illusion! You are nothing. Nothing! The day you disappear from the living, what will be left of you is only a shriveled, disgusting memory. But what we believe in will live forever. So it seems I was not able to convince you. All I can do is have him climb the first step of our paradise. Don't you think? Don't hurt him. He will soon be a military in your army. We have spoken enough. Let's go rest. Yes, naturally. The thought that you can remain so little, saddens me. But I'll expect another visit when you return from China. Please, don't interrupt the celebration. Thank you for everything, Alau. Sleep well and don't worry about your son! Now I understand. The aim of torture is disgracing a man in front of himself. The old man thinks he has won. But he has lost! I will die damned! I will die like a coward! Calm down. It's not true. You have shown great courage, beyond the limits of resistance. I will never forget you. It's only thanks to you if I regained my faith again. If that is true, son, then I will be less terrorized to appear in front of Him. Master! Marco Polo is a prisoner of the old man. Round up 15 armed men and a saddled horse. Don't wake up the Polo brothers. Tomorrow morning you'll tell them Marco will join them in 2 days. Mongolian Prince Nayan donated 5 bags of gold to me to interrupt the journey of the 5 Christians that are going to visit your father, Koublai Khan. To have me interrupt the journey of the 5 Christians. Yes, alright. Wait here. - Desert lion! - Mountain eagle! Come, Alau. My solitude vanishes when my eyes look upon you. Sit down, please, my friend. Rest from the journey. Please, describe the most beautiful of your wives to me. For you, great and valorous eagle of the mountain, I will exalt the beauty of Jasmine, the most beautiful of my wives. - Remove the mask. We are alone. - Yes, you're right. You are the only person in the world who can see my face without ending up immediately in paradise as a reward. I feel cooler like this. I realize you enjoy living in the artificial paradise of hashish, but why do you cover your face with a mask? You think I could convey terror and respect with a face like this and with all this lard? This is an immortal symbol. The people always follow the symbol, not the man. But... Tell me. Give me the joy of this sweet vision. She has two tiny feet that are exquisitely proportioned. Each toe is like a love poem. Perfect legs stem from her delicate ankles, in the captivating passion of true love. Her look is as deep as a mountain lake that shines among eternal snow and cries out to you, "Come, my sweet loved one." "Love me, fountain of every love. Kiss me." Deliver Marco Polo to me immediately. Your words have brutally wiped away a divine vision, cousin. Why punish your trusted friend? According to our agreement, you must not molest the caravans! Marco Polo is a travelling salesman of Christianity. The caravan was under my protection and I want him back immediately! It is not good for either of us that he reach Koublai Khan. Let the Mongolians fight the Christians. We can gain from it. I want him back, I said, without further nonsense! Alau, there will be trouble. We'll have the Mongolians here, the crusades on the other side, both busy conquering the promised land. The Jews have already been a bother for 2,000 years! We will be torn between two fires, crushed like walnuts, between the Christian Jews and the Christian Mongolians. Let's stop the seed of Christianity from spreading in China! Can you imagine yellow Christians? Listen, old man. I know about your dealings with the Mongolians. They paid you very well. Only small gifts of no importance. Alau, today you often offended my honor and my pride. Dear step-brother, you oblige me to strike you with another blow. - Really? Will it be painful for me? - I'm afraid so. Remember one day long ago you gave me a dagger covered with gems and with your coat-of-arms on the handle? It was a gesture of brotherly love. And as such, I accepted it. If you don't deliver Marco Polo to me immediately, safe and sound, that dagger will be found stabbed in Ahmed's back, the delegate of Prince Nayan, who is now your guest. - It wouldn't be a good thing for you. - Nor would it be for Ahmed. However, if you've decided to kill him, do so, but I beg you to use another dagger. You know that when I die this mask will go to you. - You will inherit my kingdom. - I already have a kingdom. I don't desire having yours. I want Marco Polo. Only you can make me do what I don't want, but I can't help caring for you and considering you like a son. And to prove it to you, I will bring Marco Polo here. Beloved and brotherly friend! Marco, drunk with hashish, was an easy prey in the hands of the Old Mountain Man. Or at least he thought that. The Venetians, teachers of science, of poisons and antidotes, had given the young man a secret powder hidden in the bezel of a ring. I order you to stab this dagger in Alau's back, before he leaves the palace. Before he leaves the palace. Before he leaves the palace. My men are waiting for us outside. Go ahead and lead the way. My esteemed friend, when Prince Nayan and the Mongolian generals will find out about your betrayal, they will swear to kill you! You are mistaken, my untrusting friend. Everything will end according to my wish and our plans. Didn't you say that whoever sees your face must die? That is so. - Alau saw your face! - How can you be sure of that? I heard you two talking! If that is so, then you can see me too, my dear brother. It is painful to lose a friend. They're running away! Alarm! On horseback! Let's get them! We tricked them well, huh, Marco? I feared that the Old Mountain Man would send me to his paradise. - Thank you for liberating me. - It was a pleasure. I hope one day you'll return to see the beauty of my land. I accept your invitation. I'll be your guest upon my return from China. I must join my father now. Where is he? If you gallop a full day, you will be with him. The shortest way is through the Assir Passage. - In which direction? - East. Look. Your father and your uncle should be here at this hour. We are here. Follow the valley to the east, going straight, and you will reach a crossroad. You must turn left and you'll join them here. - On the right, master. - No, that's a dangerous road. He must turn left and it will be quicker. - It is much shorter - No, it's longer. - But it's easier to follow. - I said left. As you like it, master. You will be his guide. Marco didn't follow Alau's advice. He took the wrong road, galloping towards a precise destination. Going east at all costs, and joining the caravan. Soon he found himself in the desert. Beyond the mountain, only a few miles away, the Polo brothers were travelling towards Samarkand, not knowing that Marco had lost his way. The territory covered by young Marco was crossed by bloodthirsty and savage horsemen. They were Mongolian, launched in a ruthless hunt. They were after an inoffensive being that had no other riches than a message of peace from one man to another. And yet, the order was precise. Capture and kill him like that worst of enemies. - What are you playing, children? - Merchants, with a real coin. Marco had found a trace of the passage of his father's caravan. - It's strange, huh? - Yes, but who gave it to you? Two travelers who slept here one night. Where did they go? In that direction, towards Samarkand. Your boots are lovely. Here. Thank you. - Greetings to you. - Greetings. The children told me two foreigners came by here. Do you know when and where they went? They were here two days ago, coming from the west. They continued towards the east, taking the road to Samarkand. Did you see a young foreigner coming from the west? In the sky, the two Templars realized how great the wisdom of the Pope was. Where a shrewd and armed messenger would've been caught and killed, Marco had found safety and a refuge, by arousing, thanks to his youthful attractiveness, tender love emotions in the heart of a young girl of another race. What can even the most powerful world army do against a woman determined to save her love? Wait! It's me, Taha! What is it? Why did you follow me? I brought two horses. Let me come with you. I am very grateful to you. You can come. We will ride together and I will take you where you must go. And so Taha left her land and her people to guide Marco to Samarkand. It was written that at that moment the message of Christianity to the fabulous lord of the Orient, was entrusted to the intuition of a young girl in love. Samarkand, the intersection of a hundred caravans. Samarkand, a melting pot of peoples and races. The caravan of the Polo brothers was obliged to pass by there, and Marco had a good chance of joining his father and uncle. Come. Let's look inside. But where there is a commotion of merchants and messengers with gold and secret orders, there is always a beautiful woman who works for someone who remains in the shadows. Do as I say. Obey without arguing. It is an order by Prince Nayan. The girl with the whip had no other name. She was generously rewarded by the Mongolians for her services. Are you Venetian? Yes. At this point, the two Templars looked at the stars, perplexed, and were again overtaken by the doubt that maybe the choice of the Pope, with all due respect, was a bit risky. I like your name. It has a pleasant sound. I've decided, Marco. I want to come to Venice with you. Don't laugh. When I decide something, I do it. I'm not going to Venice. I'm going to China. It's late. In this season you won't be able to cross the desert. Nobody will want to be your guide. I will try just the same. I must reach Koublai Khan. Why are you so set on seeing Koublai Khan? It would be too difficult to answer this question. Marco, your father has arrived! He is here! He's down there! Hey, father! I'm Marco! - Father! Uncle Matteo! - Marco! We had lost all hope of finding you! You are dressed as princes. Look at me! I crossed deserts and mountains to get here! Are you or not the Pope's delegate? Then your attire doesn't matter! No. The desert is too dangerous. I care about my animals. I don't want to lose them or have them suffer. In this season they'd die of hardships and the cold. - I only ask you to be our guide. - No. What if I doubled the number of animals and provisions for the trip? - How much for your horse? - It's not for sale. I pay well. Why not? - Well? - No. What if I triple the price? Don't insist, please. It's too dangerous. - Think it over well. - It's not a matter of money. I won't accompany you. We were born in this country and don't need a guide. If the foreigners want to continue the journey through the desert, we will be happy to help them. Everyone refused. You don't think it's dangerous? There is always danger everywhere, but we are men, and there isn't an enemy or snow storm that can frighten us. Alright, we'll go with you. A trap had been set for Marco where he would find death, but the girl with the whip knew this. So the two Templars had to again believe in the heavens. The choice of the Pope had been wise after all. The handsome face of Marco had softened the heart of the girl, and gave her the courage to rescue him and risk her life. Tell me! Why did you run after me? - What do you want? - You'll see. - Did something happen? - My horse is down there. Let's go back, the two of us. I already told you it's impossible. Come on. Go back to Samarkand and forget me. You knew about this betrayal and didn't warn me! - I saved your life. - I should kill you! - Kill me. - Where is your horse? The girl with the whip died, but not in vain. With her death she saved the life of Marco Polo, and in one instant was forgiven of the many sins she committed. Just one gesture of generosity often absolves a lifetime of mistakes. Now Marco was faced with another desert, more terrible than the former one. And there was no beautiful girl now to help him. In the immense desolation, Mongolian horsemen looked for the young man, ready to pounce on him and kill him. The thousand dangers of the desert were tightening around him. But Marco had changed. He was more mature, less impulsive. Ever since the wise Templar had died in his arms, he saw the world with different eyes. Marco had become a man. After having survived this desert, he met other young girls and stopped to find pleasure in the joys of a fleeting instance, but he knew that the road to travel would not be one of only carefree pleasures. He had been assigned a mission, and he would accomplish it, cost what it may. When he survived the great desert after many hardships, Marco was exhausted, practically dying, right at the doors of the so desired China. Some strange men on the mountains were looking for him and finally found him. But... Where am I? You are at the doors of China. We have been waiting many months for you. Many vicious men had tried to stop Marco's journey. But many were men of good will, desiring that the message of peace reach the emperor. Koublai Khan was Mongolian, the head of a great empire that had recently conquered China. Away from his authority, the Mongolian warriors ransacked and pillaged the Chinese lands. But Koublai Khan was a wise man, and realized that as emperor of China he couldn't behave any longer as a despotic prince of Mongolia. One of his first political gestures in bringing peace to the country, was his decision to marry a Chinese princess to show everyone his desire to be assimilated in the great race that was now under his domain. From the 4 corners of the empire, noble girls were invited to his court so that the Great Khan could choose his bride. One of these princesses stopped at the monastery where Marco had found refuge. The head of the bonzes thought that the best way to have the young Venetian reach the court of the emperor was that of having him join the escorts accompanying the young girl. Did you make it? It's beautiful. - The Mongolians have left. - Very well. Continue. Prince Nayan, son of the emperor, was against his father and headed a faction that wanted an eternal war. With straw heads he practiced cutting off the heads of enemies. He had ordered to stop Marco Polo fearing that the message of the Pope would increase the desire for peace in the heart of his father. Nayan was convinced that the Mongolians shouldn't stop, and that their conquest should extend to the limits of the earth. The generals are united, the emperor wants you at court. - Guard! - What are you doing? I am the delegate of His Holiness the Pope. Please tell the emperor that I ask to be received. - Is this man with you? - I am His Holiness' delegate! - Take him away! - I am the Pope's delegate! Let me go! The emperor will find out, and you will be in trouble. - What happened? - A foreigner dared raise his eyes on one of the princesses. I can't order to return the rice conquered with arms! - The soldiers are famished! - So are our farmers! They don't have our rights. We Mongolians are the winners! There isn't enough rice for everyone. May our celestial emperor tell us his thought now that he heard the truth from his Mongolian generals. Yes, let's hear it! - Excuse me? - We illustrated the situation. - I wasn't listening. - We've been here yelling for hours! Your cries are disturbing my cat. Then I'll speak softly, celestial sovereign. My Mongolians won't be able to understand why they must return the rice to Chinese farmers who are subjects! Not give, but share. I am the emperor of China and the rice belongs to my people. If your soldiers didn't understand, you didn't succeed in your mission. There is a solution if the emperor wishes to feed everyone. We can plunder the lands of the west, and be able to feed 200 million Chinese! It's better if we attack, than wait for them to attack! War only means massacres. If we exploit our resources, our children and their children will no longer suffer from famine. This is a glorious objective, even for soldiers like us. Allow me to welcome the prince, your son, who has decided to leave his horses. For a Mongolian prince, even horses are a State matter. We realize how difficult it is for a Mongolian to become Chinese. It is difficult for our emperor too. Yes. My head feels Chinese, but my feet mark the pace. What has our sovereign decided? To proceed with head or with feet? We must learn to proceed with both. Return to you provinces and tell the troops that I want peace, not war, and that within seven days, I will give them a Chinese woman as queen. These meetings are more tiring than a month on horseback. You should participate. You will be emperor one day. When that time comes, only my opinion as emperor will matter for me. A man alone is never able to be infallible. - Infallible or not, he's the emperor. - The princesses are ready. Good. When will you marry? Chinese women are too refined. I prefer the savage Mongolian ones. A Mongolian girl that I loved was not savage. Help me choose. I prefer staying with my generals and learning diplomacy. Princess Mei Ling, from the province of Guangxi, age 18. She plays the lute and writes poems. Your beauty transforms the confusion in choosing into delight. Princess Tzai Tan, from the province of Yunnan, age 19. She plays the lute and writes poems. Your beauty transforms the confusion in choosing into delight. Princess Gogatine, from the province of Xinjiang, age 16. She plays the lute and writes poems. Your beauty transforms confusion... Who did her horoscope? Come closer. You are a child. I am 16 years old. I will have many gifts given to you to compensate your disappointment. It wouldn't be wise for an emperor to marry such a fragile woman. I don't desire being the wife of the emperor. - Why? Perhaps you don't like me? - No, celestial majesty. - Why, then? - Because you are the Great Khan and I am afraid of you. Besides, I love someone else. Someone else? These words could cost your life. But I love him! Your life is hanging on a thread. You could be tortured. My life doesn't matter and he is in danger. Only you can help him. He has come from the west and his name is Polo. - His caravan was assaulted... - The Polos are in China? - Is Niccolò here? - No, Marco is here. In prison. The Mongolian archers assaulted his caravan. - The Mongolian archers? - He's the only one who survived. Please, protect him, celestial majesty. The Mongolians? There's a man in prison whose name is Polo. Bring him to me. Father. Judging from your face, the choice has disappointed you. A caravan from the West was assaulted by Mongolian archers. The Mongolians are soldiers, not bandits. - Is the man responsible among you? - Who accuses us? - I accuse you. - On what basis? It is rare that something takes place in my domains without your knowing. Father, that is unfair. - Is your name Polo? - Marco Polo. - Are you a relative of Niccolò? - I am his son. Kneel before the emperor! He is not a prisoner, but a guest! Where is your father? - Are you Koublai Khan? - Where is your father? I'd like to know, too. The Mongolian guides assaulted us and... - Why did they do that? - Many tried to stop us. My father and uncle were captured. I escaped and swore that at any cost I would give you the message from the Pope, even risking my life. It was important that the message of peace arrive in time. Two Templars were killed before reaching Samarkand. With the help of God, one of us managed to arrive. He is a ballad singer! He should be accompanied by a lute. Majesty, I am not worthy of being the bearer of the word of the Pope. Your message started with the words, "magnitudinem in Coelis et..." "Pacem in Terris..." His Holiness answers with a fatherly heart, "Peace to all of humanity". The Pope speaks of peace and rounds up men for war. - His Holiness does not lie! - Everyone lies if they've interests. I believe the Pope and believe my friend, Niccolò. - And I believe this boy. - And you don't believe your son? Am I wrong? Should I believe you? - Why are you staying? - We are sure that our Khan does not desire to remain alone among the Chinese with this Christian. I will send my soldiers to find your father. Majesty, I brought you the Pope's message. My mission is over. I will look for my father and uncle. They wouldn't allow you to leave. Lately I often dreamed of being killed in my sleep. Along the entire journey, I saw hatred everywhere. Violence! Violence and killing! If the 2 most powerful men of East and West don't reach an agreement, what hope is there for us? Why is there so much hatred? And why is it so difficult for men to live in peace? In war, everyone knows what he must do. In peace, it is uncertain. Some want power, some want earnings, some want love. Many choices and much confusion. Only one thing matters in war... Killing or being killed. So there's no hope? Man will never change? He'll change. Tomorrow. Even today. Do you two know each other? - Yes. - I saw him once. - How is it possible? - I looked at him. - You know nothing about him. - No, but I can imagine. An astrologer reads the stars, a statesman makes laws, but the heart follows its own path. During the year of the dragon, on the emperor's day of birth, the great Koublai Khan make a blood pact with his adopted people by choosing a Chinese empress and making solemn the commitment to give China 100 years of peace. May the new empress give the Great Khan 100 children. - What will he do now? - According to the color he chooses, we'll know which princess he marries. Princess Tzai Tan di Yunnan is the new empress! While he plays with fireworks, let's assault the palace! You want me to declare war on my father? Every son substitutes his father sooner or later! Your moment has come! Become emperor while there is something to govern! - Take the throne and let's go to war! - I will talk to my father first. Watch out that the fox doesn't put you in a trap! - Are you enjoying the fireworks? - I've never seen anything like it. What are they made of? Why do they make so much noise? It's a powder that our wise men have known about for a long time. They are just noisy toys of light. Light it. It's not just a toy. In evil hands it can be dangerous. Yes, this idea often tormented me. Being an empress is very easy. You need only kneel and greet with grace. The Mongolian troops are preparing to attack. - They will overtake us! - Let's use the magic powder! - I will decide! - At least let's get ready! So be it. What is happening? War. Do you come as an enemy or as a son? As a son I come to apologize for my behavior today. As supreme commander, I come to give you an ultimatum. I accept my son's apology. As for the ultimatum, make sure you have victory in your fist, or your ultimatum will be your humiliation. Behind me there is an army of Mongolians, and only the Chinese are defending the palace. - You want to overthrow your father? Tonight an emperor and his supreme commander are speaking. I listen to the supreme commander. My men will not give up what they conquered with their blood. When the sun rises, either accept to lead us, or I will take the throne. There is no need for you to take it. I will give it to you. It's there. It is an ordinary, rather uncomfortable chair. My cat sits on it, but that does not make him an emperor. You will govern when you acknowledge inside your heart the dream, the hunger of millions. If you are ready, I'll abdicate. But if the throne for you is just a right for war, then you will have to take it with force. What has changed you? Age? A comfortable life? I know it's not fear. Why don't we invade the West? - War is not a solution. - We are soldiers! When you were a child, we were nomads. We had no country. We needed land for rice, so war was inevitable. Now we have a country and have land. Times have changed. You have changed. Trust what I say, not as an emperor, but as a father. Hold back you zeal and learn to wait. The wait won' be long. We've already waited! We have waited enough! May I ask that you do something, as a son? - Speak up. - Think about what I said. I hope that before dawn you will join us. I will ask you the identical thing. Don't have the new sun find us on enemy fields. I hope so! An unworthy son says goodbye to his beloved father. Koublai Khan made the fatal decision of showing the men that the magic powder could be used for less innocent aims. Its use was not only that of colored fireworks in the sky. Attack! Charge! The old fox... was shrewder than the wolf. That doesn't comfort me. You know the magic... of thunder. It isn't magic, son, but a source of destruction. Go to war... conquer. You will be... master of the world! - The caravan is ready to leave. - Are the gifts and ambassadors on it? They are just waiting for your farewell. With great relief I had news of my father. - He is safe in Samarkand. - This pleases me very much. Marco, tell the Pope what you saw here. Don't exaggerate in describing good, and don't make evil look better. One more favor. Don't talk about... my pain. That only belongs to me. I foresaw your desire, and already gave such orders to the ambassadors. I will not leave with the caravan. I... would like to stay here. What holds you? Philosophy or Chinese beauty? I am staying for Koublai Khan, a wise man who I will not leave until I have learned what he can teach me. Marco, I don't have much to teach you, but knowing how to advise, is a gift coming from experience. I will accept all your advice, as from a father. And I will give it, as if you were a son. The caravan headed towards the West carrying with it a message of peace to the entire Old World. A message that would be received only a long time later. Having left behind adventures and dangers, and forgetting the smiles of many women, Marco found, at the same time, knowledge and love. He stayed in China, and remained there for 17 years before deciding to return in the land of his youth. He had the wisdom that only maturity and experience can give. His eyes had seen fabulous and faraway countries. He became familiar with the hearts of men beyond the known borders, and so he wrote his story. The story that we just told.
