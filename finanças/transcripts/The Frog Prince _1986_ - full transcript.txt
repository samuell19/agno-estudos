(WHISTLING TUNE) (WOMAN CHATTERING) (GLASS BREAKING) COOK: Careful! (CONTINUES WHISTLING) Where is everybody? Even princesses should knock. Have you seen my uncle, the King, or Henrietta? No. Can't you see I'm busy scrambling my eggs? (EGG BREAKS) (CHUCKLING) Besides, you know you're not allowed in here. My recipes are secret! Shoo! Go on, scoot. Now! This instant! Sorry. Hi.

The flag. Did you see? I... What I mean is, do you know what's going on? You usually know everything, Henrietta. And...do you? No, I don't. Oh, come on, Henrietta, let's go look at this. We will. In a second. Look at what? None of your business. You sure you don't know what's going on? Yes, but... If you want, why don't you go ask Uncle? 'Cause we're not allowed to interrupt. Remember, we promised. HENRIETTA: We can today. He told me at breakfast. He did? Uh-huh. Then I'll go ask him. Good. And when I find out I'll come and tell you. I mean, if you'll let me. We'll see. (GASPS) (CHUCKLES) Want to know a secret? Mmm-hmm. (WHISPERING) You... You mean only one of you is a true princess? We all know who it will be. But why didn't you tell her that? Uncle doesn't know I know. I intercepted the letter. Aren't I brilliant? This is the worst day of my life. (TINKLING) Oh, stop it, please.

(SIGHS) Do try and act a little bit more like a princess, just in case it is you. (CLEARS THROAT) All right, Uncle. I'll try. Hmm. I couldn't tell her. I couldn't break her heart. (SIGHS) I know who he'll choose. (ADVISORS GROAN) (SIGHS) (HENRIETTA LAUGHING) Hey, Henrietta. (HENRIETTA SHUSHING) (CONTINUES LAUGHING) Come on, I know you're in there.

(LAUGHING) The Duke of Bowl! Look at those ears. (EXCLAIMS IN DISGUST) They stick out! Stick out? He's ugly enough for Zora. (DULCEY CHUCKLES) (GASPS) It's me. Remember? Who asked you? Guess nobody. You're always horning in. Why don't you just get your own friends? Let her stay. (EXHALES) Well, I suppose it's all right. Henrietta? Why did you tell me it was okay, when it wasn't? HENRIETTA: I said you could stay. I didn't say you could talk. But the flag and the trumpets. What's going on? Come on, Dulcey, where were we? Look at him! Come on, let me see. The Prince of Freedly! Oh. Look at him, he'd love me. He is so handsome! His eyes... (GASPS) Wait! It says a wicked witch cast a spell on him. He hasn't been seen for a year. Can I see? Go play with your ball. Uncle told me to try and act more like a princess. He told you to act more like a princess? Well, I wouldn't bother if I were you. How can I act like a princess? Could you help me? Don't make me laugh. But, gee... Grow up! I am grown up. I'm twelve and a half. Look, I don't have time for this right now. Besides, you talked. You're banished! Come on, Henrietta. I said leave! Bye. (GROANS) Sisters. You are so lucky you don't have one. I can act like a princess. They'll see. I know what to do. I'll have the turkey. SERVANT: Yes, Your Majesty. Now, listen. I don't want any mention of this Baron Von Whobble and the sunset dance. I'll tell my nieces about it myself, later. Now, let's just try to conduct ourselves properly and... And do try to behave like adults. Your Majesty! Ah! (GROANS) (ALL GROANING) (ADVISOR BLOWING NOSE) Must you do everything that I do? (CLEARING THROAT) Excuse me, Your Majesty.

Thank you, Uncle. Excuse me, Your Majesty. (CLEARING THROAT) Princess Zora! (ADVISORS MURMURING) (ALL LAUGHING) ADVISOR 1: What does she look like? Charming. ADVISOR 2: What a terrible dress! Honestly, Uncle, the way she carries that stupid ball! She's such a child. What will we do with her? (SNORING) I wish... Oh, if only there was someone to talk to. (SPLASH) My lucky ball. I've lost it. (GASPS) Hmm. (HUMMING) Good evening, sweet lady. Who are you? Who do I look like? You look like a frog! Sort of. I beg your pardon. I'm not just sort of a frog, I'm a pedigreed amphibian. Pedigreed? Frogs aren't pedigreed. Of course they're pedigreed. Care to see my lineage? You can't be a frog! And why not? Well, I don't know. It's just that for a frog, you're awfully tall. Oh. You noticed? Yes, I am rather tall. It's because... You see, it's like this. ♪ When I was a tadpole I was such a sadpole ♪ Because I was so different from my brothers ♪ While I was a pollywog I never was a jollywog ♪ I wanted to be like all of the others ♪ But I never got my druthers ♪ I was a too-tall frog ♪ Always a too-tall frog ♪ Miserable and lonely all the time ♪ Teased and tormented and treated like slime ♪ I was a too-tall frog ♪ Caught in a too-small bog ♪ Everything I tried to do turned to crud ♪ I sat upon my lily pad and felt like a dud ♪ And all around the swimming hole ♪ My name was Mud ♪ I was a too-tall frog ♪ Then one day it happened ♪ As it happens every spring ♪ The cranes and storks and kingfishers ♪ Hungrily take wing ♪ And fly to the nearest bog they find ♪ And try to eat every frog they find ♪ But this year they got a big surprise ♪ When I jumped out and it scared them ♪ Right back into the skies ♪ Hooray for the too-tall frog ♪ Make way for the too-tall frog ♪ Everyone, including me, realized ♪ There's plenty of practicality ♪ In being my size ♪ Hooray for the too-tall frog ♪ Make way for the too-tall frog ♪ Suddenly and wonderfully my life made sense ♪ Now I don't mind that I'm inclined to be immense ♪ And everyone who knows me now ♪ Says I am a prince ♪ Not bad for a too-tall ♪ I'm glad I'm a too-tall ♪ Too-tall frog You're not too tall. You're just right. I am? Yes. Thank you. I thought you'd see the light. Shall we? And what about you? What about me? Well, I could be mistaken, but when I first saw you, you looked a little sad. Come on, you can tell me. I'm just a frog. Well, you see, Henrietta... She's my sister. Well, she said something mean and then I lost my lucky ball. It dropped in your fountain. And it's my favorite thing. But wait, you're a frog. And if you're a frog... Don't frogs swim? Of course I swim. I'm a champion. Then could you do me a favor and get it for me? Hmm. Why should I get it for you? You didn't even believe I was pedigreed. But I do now. If I get it for you, will you do something for me? What? Will you be my friend? Friend? Well, you see, it's not that easy. Uncle doesn't like me to... But I'd get it for you in a flash. All you have to do is promise to be my friend, no matter what. And take me to your palace. Well... Just for a while. You see, I'm a frog, and we frogs can't be too long without water. Please? You see, I get lonely sometimes. You do? Me, too. Then will you promise? I guess, if you get me my ball. Say it. I promise to be your friend. No matter what. No matter what. And? BOTH: And take you home to the palace. Hey! It was there all along. I am sort of clever. Remember. You promised. (CROAKS) It's okay. I may be cold blooded, but I've got a warm heart. (WHISPERING) First, we have to pass the sleeping guard. It's okay. He always sleeps. But once we're inside, we'd better be careful. No offense, but Uncle's a little squeamish about things that go bump in the dark. (GUARD SNORING) (CROAKS) (CONTINUES SNORING) (DOOR OPENS) (SLAMMING DOOR) (SHUSHING) (SHUSHING) (ADVISORS WHISTLING TUNE) (WHISTLING) Wait. Well, they look like they know where they're going. Oh! Oh. Hello. Hello. Nice night. Nice to see you know how to walk. I was beginning to think you did not know how. (FROG PRINCE CROAKS) (CROAKING CONTINUES) Did you say something? (CLEARS THROAT) It was a frog. I mean, I had a frog in my throat. You know. Ribbit! Ribbit! Oh, good grief! (CROAKS SOFTLY) (WHISPERING) Up here. You are clever. I told you. I'm exceptional! Wait here. Ladies and gentlemen, you are now about to see one amazing amphibian! (DRUM ROLL) Wow! Oh, that was nothing. You should see me catch flies. (SLURPS) (CHUCKLES) Where to, sweet lady? To my chambers of course, squire. Henrietta, are you listening? Yes. Oh, that poor girl. Uncle, you're making me nervous. Oh. Am I? Yes. So? So... Oh, as I was saying, after this Baron Von... Waggle, Woggle, whatever his name is, has made his decision, there will be a sunset dance. (SIGHS) There. Now you know as much about it as I do. I don't know what you're so worried about. Take one look at me and that will be that. What about Zora? (SCOFFS) Zora, a princess? Please. But she's such a child. She tries so hard and... She does adore you. Don't you care about her feelings? Yeah. Don't you? Zora! Zora! Zora! Why is everyone always thinking about Zora! Of course, I care how she feels. And don't worry. When I'm princess I'm still going to let her speak to me. But, Uncle, if you really cared, you wouldn't let her come at all. Because the Baron's going to pick me and the poor little thing is just going to die. Yes. I'm afraid so. (DOOR CLOSES) (WHISPERING) Come on. I think we're safe here. Good. Who's that? My older sister, Henrietta. Well, you know she really is very, very... Well, she is... I know. You don't have to tell me. She's beautiful! Not like me. Hmm? Hey, come on. I think you're beautiful. I must be doing something right. My sweet lady smiles. You keep saying lady. I'm not a lady. Yikes! Are you a frog? No. I'm just a girl. A girl? A girl! Hardly! Why, aren't you ravishing? Scrumptious? Exquisite? (CROAKING) The trouble is you just don't know it. No. I'm not ravishing. Or scrumptious. Or exquisite. Want to make a bet? First time I saw you, that's just what I thought. Really? Really. Come on. Come on. I'll show you. Take a look. Come on. If you look long enough, you'll see how other people see you. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Darling, it's me. Oh, no, it's Uncle! Oh! He's heard what a charmer I am, now he's dying to meet me. I don't think so. I think you'd better hide. Zora, can you hear? Hurry! Whoa! Hurry! (GASPS) Oh, my dear! Hello, Uncle. Dear, darling child... (CLEARING THROAT) What's wrong? (STUTTERING) The flag, it flies because there's going to be a sunset dance. There. This will explain it. A sunset dance! Not now. You'll come and you'll try and you won't be hurt. At a sunset dance? Why should I? My dear... I don't know how to say it... I'm not one for emotions. I love you, too, Uncle. (LAUGHS) Good night, my dear. Good night. Is that a new toy? I just got him. Isn't he cute? Oh, I suppose he's cute. I'm not one for frogs, myself. But he's cute. I suppose. Good night. Good night. (DOOR OPENS) (BELL RINGING) Very lifelike for a toy! (CHUCKLES) Good night. ZORA: Good night. Oh, I just love to dance. I knew something was going to happen. I wonder why nobody told me. Shall I? Absolutely. I never wanted to go to some stupid old dance anyway. What? I don't stand a chance. Yes, you do. But she's the princess. How do you know? Because I don't act like a princess. I don't even look like a princess. Well, then, I'll teach you. But you're a frog! I may be a frog, but I know something about princesses. Even a little about princes, too. So, let me be your friend. Let me help you. Come on, what have we got to lose? We? Well, I'm your friend, sweet lady. And when you have a problem, I have a problem, too. So, what have we got to lose? You mean, you really would help me? Mmm. 'Course I would. Ribbit! And ribbit to you, too. Well, where do we begin? First, some water for the frog. (GARGLING) (LAUGHING) (EXCLAIMS) Now, to the ballroom. First, I'll bow. Then you curtsey. How's that? But... Maybe this will help. Now, watch the expert. (HUMMING) Now, you try. Be steady, poised, and confident. Uh-huh, that's right. Oops! Oh! Oh, no. Try it again. Turn. Back straight. Eyes forward. Now, turn. That's a princess! Perfect. Excellent! Now what? Are you ready for the best part? (WALTZ MUSIC PLAYING) May I have this dance? I don't know how. It's easy. Let's see. It's been a long time since I've done this myself. But this is how I remember it. One, two, three. One, two, three. Remember, a princess should always keep her head held high. Psst! Do you see what I see? Yeah! He's so cute. HENRIETTA: No, stupid. Her. Look! I mean, she's... DULCEY: She's beautiful. No. She looks almost like a princess. She's not going to have the opportunity. (MUSIC STOPS) Thank you, my princess. You're welcome, kind frog. There's just one more thing. Now, this color's perfect. Are you sure? Have I led you astray before? Believe me, this color is perfect. Well, sweet lady, I have to go. I have to get back to the water. So, I must say good night. (CROAKING) No! Please don't go. I mean, what if I don't remember it all? We could meet tomorrow if you like. We'll go over it again and practice. We could? I'll meet you by the fountain in the morning. Good. Are you sure? You will be there, won't you? Frog's honor. (GASPS) Wait. Before you go, I want you to have this. It's your lucky ball. See, I'm not so sure it is lucky. But it's my favorite thing. And you said you got lonely sometimes. And sometimes when you hold it, it helps. Then I'll hold it tight. Good night, sweet lady. Good night. ZORA: See you tomorrow. Come on! Where? Shh! Frogging, dimwit. We can't capture him.

Come on, Henrietta. Just a minute. Who's Ribbit? I just told you. He's my friend. My best friend. That's who. HENRIETTA: You have a best friend? I do. Seen him lately? He's coming. What's this? Hey, that's for him! Well, he won't be needing it. Not where he is. How do you know where he is? You've never even seen him. Is he green, tall, kind of slimy? Stop it! What did you do with him? You really want to know? We took him to the Woods of the Dark Heart. The Woods of the Dark Heart? He asked for you to come, Zora, you'd better hurry. He's pretty thirsty. I'm not sure he's gonna make it. I'll tell Uncle. You'll tell him what? That you know a frog who could talk. He'll believe you. I'm sure he will. Let's go. If you hurry you can save him. I hope he's all right. Quick! Wait a minute, where are you going? My friend is in trouble. What friend? The friend I told you about before. I have to help him. I promised. You promised me you'd come. You promised you'd try. Don't you want to be the princess? Yes I do, but he needs me. But the Baron will be coming soon. I know, but... But what? But I think friends are more important. Don't you? All right. Go! But be careful! And be back before sunset! Yes, Uncle. Do you think Zora will be all right? She'll be fine. Well, what if she... I'm going to wear those. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Henrietta? What's going on? Do you know anything about this? Why, what do you mean, Uncle? You know perfectly well what I mean. Who's this friend of hers? The only friend I know she has is pretend and that stupid little ball she carries around. Then where's she going? Who knows? Dulcey? The way I figure it, she just knows the Baron's going to pick me and she's being a bad sport about it. I don't believe you. And if anything happens to her... Anything what, Uncle? You'll be punished for a long time. Believe me! MAN: Trumpeteers! (TRUMPET FANFARE) Baron Von Whobble of the illustrious Von Whobbles. (TRUMPET FANFARE) Greetings, Baron Von Whobble. Welcome to the Kingdom of Tartonia. Who are you? I am the Emissary. A greeter of people from faraway lands. Your nose looks like an old sea cow. (PEOPLE SNIGGERING) Excuse me? It is my best feature. Enough of this nose! I have come with a purpose. It is time. Shall we go? MAN: Trumpeteers! (TRUMPET FANFARE) He's got to be here! He's got to. (BIRDS SCREECHING) (PANTING) Ribbit? (WIND HOWLING) (GASPS) Still no sign of Zora. Keep the guards posted. And if they see anything, tell me at once. Sire. ZORA: Oh, no! Oh, Ribbit. Please, wake up. (GRUNTS) Here. Hang on to this. (BREATHING HEAVILY) Careful! I'm so glad you're all right. And to think you came all this way. What are friends for, anyway? (GASPS) But... But you're a prince. Yes, I am. There's no time to explain, sweet lady, we have to get back to the palace. But look! We'll never make it back. Your lucky ball. Oh, lucky ball, help us get back to the palace. (HORSE WHINNYING) (HORSE SNORTING) MAN: The King decrees that all proceed to the ballroom for the ceremony. What are you so worried about? I'm the one who's going to be crowned princess. Well, maybe you won't. Maybe Zora will get back. She's not going to get back. She'll never find him. Never! Well, I hope she does. Because you're cruel, Henrietta. You don't deserve it. I'd much rather be friends with Zora than you. Good. (DOOR OPENING) (DOOR SLAMMING SHUT) When I'm princess, I'll remember that! (TRUMPET FANFARE) Presenting King William, King of all Tartonia and Baron Von Whobble. MAN: Trumpeteers! (TRUMPET FANFARE) Sunset has come. Now is the time. (CLEARING THROAT) We are gathered here today, in the greatest kingdom of the southern hemisphere, to celebrate the... crowning of the true Princess of Tartonia. (CHUCKLES) I'm sure that the Baron Von Whobble will be fair in his decision. And the whole kingdom will rejoice... In his decision. And I... Baron, please. Your Majesty, noble advisors, Mr. Emissary, my lords, ladies and gentlemen. My discerning eye. (PEOPLE CHATTERING) Please, Your Majesty, have your nieces presented for inspection. (HORSE WHINNYING) (GRUNTING) FROG PRINCE: Open the gates! Open! (SNORING) Open the gates! (BANGING ON DOOR) Open! Your Majesty, Henrietta the eldest. (PEOPLE EXCLAIMING) Baron Von Whobble, what a wise judge you are. I am honored. Mmm-hmm. What style, what grace. Surely you must be without any reasonable doubt, the princess. Yes, but, in order to judge wisely, you must be fair. Where is your sister? Yes. Where? Baron, she didn't want to come. (PEOPLE MURMURING) That is not true. It must be true, she isn't here. And the decision must be made. (PEOPLE CHATTERING LOUDLY) We're too late. No, we can't be. Oh, lucky ball, I wish... I wish with all my might. Please help us. (STUTTERING) I'm coming. I'm coming, I'm coming. It's magic. Kneel, please. Ladies and gentlemen, the moment you have all been waiting for. (PANTING) And now, by the powers vested in me, it is with great honor... I can't go in. Not like this. Nobody would think I was the princess. Here. But it only works for you. Oh, sweet lady, did it? That I do hereby pronounce you to be the one and only true princess. Wait! (PEOPLE GASPING) Who are you, young man? Yes, who are you? How dare you interrupt. Don't you know the importance of these proceedings? I am the Prince of Freedly. (PEOPLE CHATTERING EXCITEDLY) You cannot be the Prince of Freedly. He's under a witch's spell. Some say he was turned into a frog. It's true. I was under a spell. A spell which can only be broken by a true princess. And a true princess broke it. She kept her promise. May I present, Princess Zora. Baron Von Whobble, Your Majesty, Mr. Emissary, I am Zora. You radiate such beauty. Yes, Baron, hers is the purest beauty. It comes from inside. I'm so proud of you. So very proud. Only a true princess would risk everything for a friend. (SCOFFS) (FOOTSTEPS RETREATING) She kept her promise. I agree. I, Baron Von Whobble, crown you Princess Zora. (TRUMPET FANFARE) (ALL CHEERING) Start the music, let the dance begin. Here, Uncle, will you keep this for me? Of course. (CROWD CHATTERING) Are you really the Prince of Freedly? Yes. But do you know what my friends call me? Yes, I do. What? Ribbit. Ribbit.
