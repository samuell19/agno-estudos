Heading:TRlCHY THASlLDHAR VANlSHED. Who're you, what's the matter? Nagarcoil Magistrate has come to meet you. ls it Kumaraswamy? - Yes sir. l'm Tirunelveli reporter Shanmuga Pandian speaking. 2 unidentified people have kidnapped Tirunelveli Thasildhar as 1 .15 am. lt's Trichy Thasildhar & not Tirunelveli Thasildhar. Don't blabber in half sleep. lt's true that Trichy Thasildhar has vanished. At the same time Tirunelveli Thasildhar was also kidnapped by someone. What? 2 Thasildhars missing at the same time!? You go & stop printing the headlines. Something is going to happen. 8 Thasildhars have been kidnapped. They were kidnapped exactly at 1 .15 am from all places. How is it possible? We've information that 15 Thasildhars have been kidnapped from all over State. Oh God! 15 persons! Apart from the kidnapped Thasildhars we must protect other Thasildhars. Do you mean to say that we'll forget about those 15 Thasildhars? Who's responsible for their lives? lnform check posts to check all vehicles. Stop...Stop. Get down. SUN NEWS. Good morning. Headlines. 15 Thasildhars kidnapped in Tamil Nadu at the same time. Chief Minister has ordered to set up a special task force. Central Defence Minister comes to Chennai. 15 Thasildhars were kidnapped in Tamil Nadu at 1 .00 am. Kidnapping at the same time in various places has created huge sensation. The reason for kidnap is not yet known. Tamil Nadu Police is on red alert from 1 .00 am. Till now, no one has been arrested in this regard. Prime Minister of lndia has expressed his regret over the kidnap incident. He said this in a press release while on a visit to Kerala. Tamil Nadu's Dy. Commissioner Pandian speaks about the incident... Police dept. is functioning properly. We'll find & arrest those responsible for these incidents within 24 hours. lt's a challenge to the Police. Karur Thasildhar Mr.Muralidharan, age 53. Vandavasi Thasildhar Mr.Sadhasivam age 39. Dindugal Thasildhar Mr.Murugesan age 43. Aathur Thasildhar Mr.Subramani age 47. Naamagiri Thasildhar Mr.Ayyakannu, age 52. Aruppukkottai Thasildhar Mr.Sachidhanandhan, age 41 . Since the kidnap had taken place at the same time. Police suspect that this must be a well planned terrorist act. ''15 THASlLDHARS VANlSH'' Who? lt has been 3 days since 15 Thasildhars have been kidnapped. As a Chief minister, what action have you taken? Special task force has been set up. No organization has claimed responsibility for these kidnappings. Government is ready for talk to them. Sir, a good news- What? Have you found out the kidnappers? - No sir. All the kidnapped Thasildhars are being released in their respective places. Really! But, when?- Just now, l got a message from the Commissioners' office. Thank God. l was tensed for the past 3 days. Call Commissioner. CM is very happy, he wants to talk to you. ls it? Okay, call me again. Out of 15 Thasildhars only 1 4 have been released. They're clue less about the missing Thasildhar. Commissioner is proceeding there only. A dead body has been hanging for the past 3 hours. What the hell were you doing? Just now, we came to know that he is a Thasildhar. We sent a word for you immediately. Make arrangements to bring the body down. These files & a cassette were found with the dead body. Greetings to the Police dept. 15 Thasildhars were kidnapped all of a sudden. And 1 4 were released and 1 was murdered. You'll be busy finding the reason behind this. The government stables must be cleared of the trash. Every officer must be afraid of getting punished if they commit any crime. This is a beginning to see a corruption free lndia. There are totally 206 Thasildhars in the Tamil Nadu. There are many Thasildhars who torment people every day. Based on their wealth we had kidnapped only the top 15 Thasildhars. Out of the 15 Thasildhars. Sambamoorthy the No 1 & most corrupt Thasildhar was murdered. Proof of their wealth is in these files. Similarly, first 15 corrupt officers of every dept. will be kidnapped. Of them the No.1 & the most corrupt officer would be murdered. The social reform started in Taluk Office will spread to other Depts. How can others get scared by killing the most corrupted? Not that...What'll happen if you threaten to kill the winner of a race? Everyone will try to go back. Everyone will go behind one another and come to the starting point. That's the plan. Kidnapping 15 people from the same dept., only one of them is killed. Then, why're the other 1 4 people kidnapped? Why should they be locked up for 3 days & then released? For the man killed, it's just a minute's punishment. After few days, even we'll forget it. But for the other 1 4 people, this will haunt them all their lives. Not only that, anyone who sees them will be in constant fear. The problem is... How much a Kanyakumari man will take as bribe, Cuddalore man may not know it. How much Cuddalore man is taking, Virudhunagar man may not know it. Fearing they'll become No.1 , they'll reduce in competition. From whom they took the bribe at exact time. Where they've bought property with that money? Photocopies of the documents. All evidences are perfect. Evidence from every place is confirming it. Any outsider to collect all this evidence is difficult. Definitely it must be someone from the same office. Working in the same office, he would've collected all this evidence. The kidnapped 15 officers work in different offices. So, this is a handiwork of a team of 15 people. As you think this is not a 15 member team. ln Tamil Nadu, there are 206 Thasildars. Out of those 206, they've selected 15 people. So, there must be one man in other 191 offices also. More serious thing than this is... They've threatened in cassette, that it'll continue in other depts. also. So, not just these 206 offices... But in every Govt. Office in Tamil Nadu, One person is working and sending all reports to someone. How?....How can it be possible? When they can collect all information about 15 offices. And if it's possible to kidnap them. Then, this is also possible. This is not a Monday's plan executed on Friday. This has been planned for years and then being executed. The man behind this can't be an ordinary man. Even an extremist organization works from forest. Or from a neighbouring country. These are different. They're among the people. How could one man get hold of one person from every office? They're just branches. Where's their root? Who's that? Who's their next target? Uncle, today's breakfast is fantastic. l've already eaten 2 chapathis. lf l eat anymore, l'll have stomach ache in school. He says....since chapathi was tasty. lt seems he had already eaten 2 chapathis. So, he says he won't be able to eat a third one. Oh! Why a white girl is coming out? Sorry! l trespassed into wrong country. No...knocked the wrong door. Excuse me. Which is Prof. Ramana's house? Standing in his compound are you asking me? Today, l must enthrall them in English. Who're you? What do you want? Are you mad to ring the calling bell? Mad man. l'm totally confused. What are you? Malayalee or Kannadiga? What do you want? - Oh God! l'm saved. l want to meet Prof. Ramana. Uncle, someone is here to meet you. How does he appear? He's like a tamarind filled gunny bag. Ask him to come in. Principal has asked you to sign this record note. 4 appear to be from different regions. This one is from our country. This is foreign. Couldn't able to understand about these kids? Sir, a small doubt. One English, one Hindi and 2 Tamil children. All 4 are calling you as uncle. Who are they? Do you really want to know it? Just to increase my General Knowledge. Go...mind your own work. Look, close the college, go home safely. That's all we can say. Why're you creating trouble during working hours? Please listen to us. For God's sake go out from here. You're going on harping the same thing. Police have arrested our constituency MLA. So, we are asking you to close the college. Do you know even wine shops are closed? No arguments. Close the college and disperse quietly. Today, an examination is scheduled. You know about National college's education. Leave all that. Close today, if you want open it on Sunday. Do you think is it any provision shop? This is college. Today's a holiday. That's all. Children, you've studied enough. Go home... Today no school. All of you go home. - Go....go... Go...go...what're you looking at? Go....go... Why're you behaving like rowdies inside a college? What's your problem? What's your problem? Haven't we told you? Just clear the place. That's all. Unnecessarily trying to throw her weight around. Why're you staring at me? lf l beat you...that's all. Look at her face. Even Police shouldn't enter a college. You rowdies have entered. Even then, do you know why l'm talking to you? Today, there's an exam. The exam shouldn't get delayed even by a minute because of you. Get out. Hey, what?....What? Trying to teach me? What'll you do if l refuse to go out? What'll you do? lt's paining...it's paining boys. l think, it's dislocation. Hey, move away boys. Let in fresh air. What happened? Don't touch...don't touch. Don't touch. His grip is iron grip. l don't think it's a dislocation, surely it'll be a fracture. Close the show here for now. Let's deal it later in the evening. Pick him up. - lt's paining, boys. Sir....my hand.... please spare me. All the slides that we just saw are about hijacks & kidnappings after 1947. Our case is more complicated than all these. Because, there's no demand or condition. 15 people are kidnapped, one is killed. Released 1 4 don't know anything about their abductors. Because they were locked up in a dark room for 3 days. They didn't go beyond 10 kms. from the place of kidnap. Moreover, they say this will be a continuous process. Don't know when & where it'll happen next? Every minute is tensed expecting a bad news. Let's consider there are 87 people working in a office. ln that one person is observing other's activities. And reporting it to an unknown man. lf we find that one man, we can find the entire network. The problem is in finding that lone man. We can use third degree to inquire like pick pockets. All are officers! Responsible people. Anyone got an idea to find them? Why're you lifting your hand? You asked about an idea... Did you fill up the tank? l asked whether you've filled the jeep's tank.- l've filled the tank. Checked Air in all 4 tyres. - l've done it. Then, park it in shade. - lt's parked in shade only. Then, you stay out. We've to discuss. No sir....in this case. You're just a constable. Don't try to advise and show us our work. lf l say go out, just do it. l wanted to tell you that day itself. He's a loud mouth. You're just a constable driving their jeep. Why do you want all this trouble? What's this? My father was an lnspector. My grandfather had worked as Police during British period. l had been selected for S.l. on merit. l'm now a constable just because l wasn't able to pay money. l want to crack this case & get my promotion. And you're making fun of me. Okay....okay. l'll not make fun of you. Look, tell me the idea of finding that one man in 87 staff. l'll listen. - Listen. Working in the same office. lf a person identifies all the bribe taking officers. Who can it be? Definitely, he'll be a clean man, who'll not take bribes. So, it's easy to find a man not taking bribe in an office. You'll definitely get promoted. l'm going to Vandavasi, Karur. l'll inquire thoroughly those 87 people. l'll definitely catch him. Watch out. We'll clear obscenity. Ban obscene posters. We'll clear obscenity. Who are you all? - l'm Devaki, a social worker. lt seems her name is Sevaki and she's a social Devaki. ....Social worker. What're you doing up there? We're defacing obscene posters. These posters are here for a week. Didn't you feel like cleaning it? Don't restrict yourself to 9 to 6 office routine. We must help this society in our own way. Since when this poster is here? - lt has been here for a week. Was there a crowd here for a week? No. Why has a crowd gathered here only today? More than the posters, dresses you're wearing is obscene. All this crowd has gathered to see that only. ls it obscene? This is fashion. Starting point of that poster is this. lf you're not interested in social work at least encourage those who do it. l'll encourage. Do you know who am l? l'm President of All World Shakila Fan's Association. l'm telling you. Climb & deface it slowly. After finishing here, come to our neighbourhood also. Move....move...give us way. What's this crowd here? Couldn't you tell us if you wanted to deface posters? All of you disperse. Get down...get down. l warned her earlier too. lf she falls down from the ladder & losses her teeth. Who'll marry her? Get lost, bald man. KARUR. Just because it's prominent, do you've to bend your hips? ls it justified to avoid young man and break his heart? You're trying to trap me, talking beautifully. Ogling at me, you're applying often. When l went alone to the shop. Everyone is asking why hasn't your fiancee come? Don't ask silly questions. Leave me alone. My heart is empty. What you're now lifting is a shovel. Go for another girl. Change your dance step. Oh! Peahen! You've adorned my heart in your hairs. Give me a reply truthfully. District Collector's Office, Vandavasi. lt's long time since we had ordered for lce cream. lt hasn't come yet. Tell him to bring it fast. He's also a big bore just like DD-1 . Why don't you change the channel? Oh! They're coming after me wherever l go. Where's she? - She had come here only. Where did she go away? How am l to escape from them? - l saw her coming this side. Someday, she'll fall into our hands. Come, let's go. Remember me? Devaki, social worker. Look at my dress now? Fully covered. Oh God! Just now l saw her coming in here. Someday she'll fall into our hands. Come, let's go boys. What're you looking at? This is quite common for social activists like me. Because l can't stay like you without bothering about society.

Sir, people opposed to me may be waiting outside for me. Could you please drop me at my hostel? Uncle, l feel pity for her. She resembles my grandma. Help her, uncle. l'm a full time social worker, a part time college student. My hostel is on that corner. lf you come, it'll lead to unnecessary gossip. l'll walk. Move out...move out from here. No...sir...no sir... They're rowdies. Don't unnecessarily get beaten up for supporting me. Look, how huge & strong they're. Still there's time, let's take an about turn & escape. Hide your weapons. Hide your weapons behind. He's not an ordinary man. Salem lron. What's this man? We're seven. 7?! Do you know we were 1 7, and still bit the dust. What? 1 7 people? We went only 1 7! lf few had joined us! Even they would've ended with broken faces & limbs. Did you get beaten up? You said your jeep overturned and fell from a flyover? Jeep didn't over turn. This man had only beat us black & blue. We were beaten to pulp. God has given us legs to walk. But, he has given him legs only to kick. lf he kicks, all seven of us would land in a heap. Do you know who am l? l'm brother of one hand Sama. Hey, He's the man who made your brother's one hand man. Hold the tail between your legs. Vehicles' radiator got heated up.

This time we must nab them. Radhakrishnan here. The fax message we had received. Totally 12 fax messages have come including one to Governor & press. 12 have come from 12 different locations. All are from public kiosks. lf they do it this time, we'll lose our honour. Don't know which department, they're going to target this time. That's giving a real headache. Press has received the fax. lt'll come on evening T.V. News. Message will reach entire Tamil Nadu. Since no one knows which department is the target. Everyone will be scared to death. ln a way this is good for us. Better than hiding behind a veil of darkness. lf they come out, it's good for us. This time atleast one will get caught.

Tamil Nadu Police have speeded up the search operations. The second incident of kidnapping of Govt.Officers. lt has created a sensation among the general public. Additional Police force has been deployed in the places of kidnap. You're hearing All lndia Radio's State news bulletin. Right. Abducting & holding us for 3 days? Are you playing with me? Bloody rogues. Release us. Are you showing tricks to Police? Do you know? Do you know who am l? - l know. l know. Your name is Varadarajan. 1994 March...24...Thursday. You joined as SP at Villupuram. 3rd day after joining service. ln the case related to the death of 16 people drinking spurious liquor. To avoid filing case on Pachaiyappan... The first bribe you took Rs.15 lakhs. You went to other places on transfer. But, Pachaiyappan killed many others in 3 more similar cases. When you were in Chidambaram. A woman was raped in Police station. Till you were in that place. Total bribe money you earned there is Rs.83 lakhs. You brought land on your wife's name in Ulundurpettai. From there, Tirunelveli, Erode, Thuthukudi, Theni.... These are different places where you had worked. lt's bribe everywhere. Number of people died, because of you is 36. Friday, the day on which you were kidnapped. The last bribe you took at 4 PM. ...Rs.6 lakhs. Even Prime Minister or Chief Minister. Don't have a right to beat people. You've been bestowed with that right. Do you know why? You're in the position of a father using stick to change his wayward son. There're many honest police officers ready to sacrifice life for duty. You're giving them a bad name. Feel proud. You're going to clean up, your entire department. Forgive me, sir. Forgive me. The only word l hate in Tamil Language. Did you see? Look! How many times l had told? He's not a single man as you think? Did anyone believe me? Look now, he has laid his hands on Police itself. Will these guys go and find them? Wait...wait...why're you shouting now? They may come here now. - Let them come. Okay. What happened to your investigation? l've almost caught them up. Almost caught them? This is Vandavasi Taluq office staff list. lnquiring them individually, l've caught that one man. Look! First man. He has bought 25 acres of land last year. So, this is not that man. This man. Has paid Rs.3 lakhs for his sons' Engineering college seat. So, he's also not that man. He has bought a Santro car. He has given 150 sovereigns of gold as dowry for his daughter. He's a corrupt man. All these people have taken bribes according to their position. But, this 47th man has never taken even a penny as bribe. Name is Kumaresan. Salary Rs.3000. A rented house of Rs.500. He owns a TVS-50 bought in installments. His son studies in a corporation school. He has donated blood 43 times at Lions club. So, this is the man who's reporting on his colleagues. May be! There are chances. Look, Karur Taluq Office Staff list. There's a man here also known as Zakir Hussain, a non-corrupt man. He's a A.D., Rs.4000 salary. Rented house. He has a younger sister. She loved a Hindu boy. He got them married. He's the most honest man in that office. lf you compare these Kumaresan & Zakir Hussain. Absolutely there are no resemblances. This man is Hindu. That man is Muslim. This man studied in Vandavasi School. That man studied in Karur school. This man studied in Perambalur Kenis Roger college. That man studied in Tirchy Bishop Heber college. May be they would've never even seen each other. Beyond all this, there's something which is common to them. There's someone between them. That man is the link between all these people working in T.N. Govt.Offices. Who's that man? How could he get hold of one person from every office? lf we catch this small fish, we can catch that shark. You're always here. Don't you like your hostel? No, l like children very much. Then, have children. l'll beat you. Aunty, who's Tamil Nadu H.R. & C.E.'s Chief secretary. He's my uncle's son. Name's Anbukkarasu, lAS. Anbukkarasu's not the Chief Secretary. lt's Malaichamy. Yesterday, l met him at Secretariat. Don't l know? lf you smile, will it become true? Bet? Mr.Anbukkarasu has gone to Thiruvannamalai on transfer. From today morning Mr.Malaichamy, lAS has taken charge. Shall l connect a call to him? - No, please. What's in it? As l had gone there in this morning. You might've gone there in the evening. Okay, tell me who's the Home Secretary? Okay. How many departments are there in Secretariat? What do you want to know? Total Tamil Nadu's population is 6.21 crores. ln that Men are 3.13 crores Women are 3.09 crores. There're 4.79 crores registered voters. Under 18 are 1 .42 crores. Literates are 4.06 crores. llliterates are 2.15 crores. 86 lakhs are below the poverty line. Agriculture land is 1 .10 lakh acres. Barren land 50 lakh acres. Total number of Collector's 30.

Grandma, l want to ask you something. - What's it, dear? That white girl, Hindi boy & other 2 children, who're they? How're they related to master? All are orphans. Do you know who's that white girl? ln Northern lndia, some time back they burnt a white couple alive, She had escaped from there. Mother, father, 2 brothers were burnt alive before her eyes. Professor has brought her here and is taking care of her. That Hindu boys' entire family got wiped in the Gujarat Earthquake. That girl's father & mother died in Coimbatore bomb blast. That boy used to cry all night for his mother when he came here. Professor used to carry him on his shoulder all the night. People don't care for their own children also. But, he's taking care of orphans like his own children. No one has such a generous heart. Smiles are back on their faces very recently. Rainbow...Rainbow... Why did you come now? Sprinkle colours in my heart. Little birds are flying and singing happily. Dew is falling on their silky wings. Oh Mother gentle breeze! Come & sing a lullaby. Any country's cuckoo will sing the same song. Any country's parrots' prattling are same. Will a gentle breeze touch us after inquiring about our religion? Will it rain selecting a country? You, me and everyone are a big family. For a loving heart. You'll achieve what you think. You'll fail in exam. You'll get married in near future. When the thick clouds moved a little... l saw the colourful moon. l stood standstill getting drowned in a river of love. lf there are few more like you. Earth will become a heaven. All that mother nature gives us will become equal to everyone. Won't the bamboo forests' make music when gentle breeze passes through it. Go to second floor, get it tested and bring the report. What's it?- The boy fell down and hurt his leg. l've written for 8 test to be conducted. The lab is in the basement. Get it tested, take the report & meet the Chief Doctor. 8 tests for such a small wound? ls it paining? No injection, please. How unjust is this? l got cut by a metal sheet. They're asking me to take a scan. We come from G.H. to private hospitals to save our lives. Looks like they'll leave us a pauper. They ask money for everything. Get him tested & meet the doctor. l'll get money from the bank. Has labour pains started for Saroja in the 3rd ward? - Yes, doctor. lt's normal delivery. No....no, it shouldn't be a normal delivery. We must do ceaserian. lf it's a normal delivery patient will go home in 2 days. But, if we operate we'll get Rs.15,000 more. She must be in bed rest for 10 days. You get their signatures in the form & ask them to pay at the cash counter. Also make the operation theatre ready. - Okay, doctor. Don't rub hard. Has all the tests been conducted? Has the doctor finished the treatment? They have applied some verdigris like thing on the wound. They've charged Rs.9500 for treatment and tests conducted. A bill of Rs.9500 for a small wound. Okay, you be here. l'll go & pay the money. Leave it. Are you the husband of Kanakavalli who's in the emergency ward?- Yes sir. Your wife died yesterday itself. l was asked to inform you after you pay the hospital bill. Has she died? l was here yesterday. Why didn't you tell me? Had you paid the money, l'd have told you? So, we're informing you after you paid the money. You scoundrels. You had kept me away even in her final moments. Look....look. She had died yesterday evening. l had also conducted prayers for her in the temple. For the past one week, l poured money whenever you asked for it. Tell me, how much more you want, l'll give you. But, can you make her speak to me? Yes, it'll be like this only over here. lf not go to the G.H. which stinks. You go home with the children, l'm going to G.H. Why?- Do as l say? Sir, you've come to help us like God. We don't even have money to perform his last rites. You don't worry, l'll take care. Leaving his two grown up daughters on the streets, He drank to his death. Madam, sign this. Do you know to sign?- l know. Sign it. Give me that book. Madam, this is the death certificate. He died at 7.10 AM. Only if you show this, you can cremate his body in the crematorium. Take it. Give that to me. - Have it, sir. No need of this vehicle. There's another vehicle. Where is the emergency ward? - This way, go straight. Fast! Be careful. Doctor, my brother fell down unconsciously. Save him at any cost. You stay outside. Nurse, take him out.- come. Doctor, save him at any cost. - You please wait outside. The patient is dead. He must've died on the way to the hospital. What shall we do now? Only we know that he's dead. People standing outside think that he's unconscious. We'll continue our treatment. Saying that he's serious, we'll continue our treatment for the entire day. What do you say, doctor? Treatment is going on. Don't worry. We'll save him. Sir, what're you saying? - Please be patient. He's telling you, isn't it? He'll save him at any cost. But, it'll cost you a lot. Can you afford it? lt's okay. l'm ready to spend any sum of money. Pay Rs.50,000 at the counter. Only then, we'll admit him. Make it fast. Bill it in the name of the patient. Doctor, l've paid the money. Medical shop is in the 2nd floor, get these medicines. Totally Rs.8300. Bill it in the name of the patient. Why're you coming so slowly without understanding the emergency? Give this in the pharmacy. Take care. Take it & check it. Be quiet & listen to me. Doctor, how is my brother? He was struggling to breathe. But, now after the treatment, he's breathing properly. Dr. Satish Sharma has come to Madras to attend a seminar. lf we ask him to come, he'll give a better treatment. But, it'll cost you Rs.2 lakhs. lt's alright. Call any number of doctors. Doctor, how is my brother? - He's in serious condition. He came to conscious. l was about to call you, he again fell unconscious. lf he comes to conscious within 2 hours, no need to worry. What's this injustice? They're treating a dead man. ls your betrothal over? ln the house?- Yes. Enjoy.- Doctor, the body decomposing rapidly. Do something before it starts stinking. We'll inform the Chief Doctor & pretend that the patient is serious. Now, the doctor will come & say. l'm sorry. We tried our best, but the patient died. We tried our best, but the patient died. You've spent Rs.3 lakhs. lf you pay the balance of Rs.2 lakhs, you can take home the body. We'll take the body if you give them Rs.20 lakhs. What're you talking? lt's said that we shouldn't lie to Doctors & Lawyers. There's one more thing which we shouldn't tell you. 'Save the life at any cost'. lf we tell, that's all. Didn't get it? A person was confirmed dead by the Government Hospital. And you had been giving treatment for that dead body for the past 8 hrs. l've the proof for that. Your hospital M.D. must come here right now. One person has fooled you all. Aren't you ashamed? What're the evidences does he have? Death confirmation certificate given by the Government & the time of death. Also, our hospital admission bill, medical bill & a file of some more bills. Connect me to Bombay. l want to talk my father. Work properly. Call from Madras. Father, l'm Rishi speaking. A person who does business and get caught is fit for nothing. l'll kill you all even if a single brick of the hospital gets damaged. Father.... Where's he now? So, you need Rs.20 lakhs for you to keep your mouth shut. Rs.23 lakhs, including Rs.3 lakhs spent by me. Hit him....hit him. l'll talk to him. He seems to be a good man. Let's discuss & settle the issue. There are Rs.20 lakhs in this bag. Educate your daughter & get them married. Where did the money come from? lt was earned by your husband. He never earned a penny when he was alive. But, he has earned Rs.20 lakhs after his death. Go. You all are the doctors working in this hospital, aren't you? There're so many religions & Gods in this world. But, if anyone falls ill, they first come to the hospital. And then go to their respective temples. You're the only God worshiped by all religions. But, you forgot about your profession. And you're playing with the lives of people for the sake of money. lt was a mistake. Forgive us. The only word which l don't like in Tamil. By Court & Collectors' orders, Since the lives of the people are in danger, This private hospital & medical college has been sealed from today. Look, he has come. We must not spare him. Get down...Get down. How dare you? Are you cheating in the name of treatment? Get down... - Don't spare him. Get down..- Don't spare him. Give me way, please move. Leave the door.... Sir, don't get down. He took money from us and also ditched us. Come out...come out. He has sent all the evidence to the President. Government has taken away the Rs.1500 crores hospital & college. They've shifted all the patients to G.H. You crook! lt's a sin to spare you. ls this your livelihood? You shameless. Get down...lf you don't get down we'll burn you alive. You've given treatment to a dead man for 8 hours. Yuck! What were you all doing? Some guy has closed the hospital and has killed my son also. What were you doing? Who is he?...Who is he? Many saw him. But no one is aware about his whereabouts. The lady who took Rs.20 lakhs knows nothing about him. She says that he met her in G.H. He did all these things in a flash. You know nothing about him. l want to know who he is. l want him. Sir, our surveillance camera at the reception records all entering hospital. lf we play that cassette, we can find him. lt's enough if we go there by 12'o clock. lt's better to be there 30 minutes before. lt's been very long time since we met. How are you? We both are from the same college. A college mate whom l don't know. l haven't seen him. There are 32 cameras in 16 blocks in our hospital. He came through the emergency block. Play that cassette first. l'm playing that cassette only. Please insert this, l want to see a list. Select those 2 names highlighted with red colour. Now, find out the place of their education. Kumaresan studied in Kenis Roger college, Perambulur. Zakir Hussain studied in Bishop Heber college, Trichy. Wait for some time. The dead man was admitted at 1 1 .30 Am. The time running now is 1 1 .23. He'll appear in the T.V within 7 mins. Fast forward the cassette. They both studied in National College. Aunty, now take all the names highlighted in red from all offices. Everyone has studied in National College. Old students of National College are responsible for everything. Each one had joined in a separate office all over Tamil Nadu. And are passing the information to someone. Now, l should find out the person who gives them the orders. He's the one. Rewind the tape. Zoom it...zoom it. Zoom it. lt has been 9 years since he died. Why're you distributing sweets to everyone Saravana? Then, do you want me to cheat others like you? l'm going to get promoted, man. ....ln near future. People aren't giving sweets even if they're promoted. He's distributing sweets for the expected promotion. He's a crack pot. Who could be the spy here who's informing about bribe takers. Definitely he must be the one who doesn't take bribe. Hey fools! Has this dawned on you only now? l want to avail the medical leave for 2 days. Now only we've found the clue. lf you apply for leave at this time. Case will be solved if you grant me leave. What are you saying? Case will be solved?- Yes sir. l've collected many things about this case. Only few more are left. l've found all this only during my medical leave. Just 2 more days. lf you sanction my leave for 2 more days. l'll finish it completely. Sir, this is my leave letter. Hey, go away man. lt's alright even if you don't grant me leave. l'll tell you whatever l found. You do the rest. Atleast promote me. He's deceiving us. Can you find out? lf you want to find something. My cigarette lighter is missing for past the 2 days. Find it first. We'll find them out. l beg your pardon. - Look, do you want to leave this room.... Or quit this job? Sir, there are 31 lakh voters in Madras. The photo which we've doesn't match with any of these photos. What l think is... l don't want to know the reason. l want only the person. l want him alive. Sir, l'm investigating this ACF case. l want to arrest one of your college staff.- What? Arrest? Are you the police officer who's handling that case? l'm the police and they're the officers. We both are different. lnfact, l'm a constable who drives their jeep. Constable? Don't phone them up. l've come here without their knowledge. You're working in police department. And committing fraud! l'm working very hard to get promotion. l'll lose my job if you phone them up. l'll come again. lt's the ration card. A.C.F's next target is ration office. Last time he mentioned only the date of his action. This time, very boldly, he has mentioned ration office. lts no more a problem when they'll get caught. Now the problem is no one should get caught by them. Sir, there are almost 24000 ration shops in Tamil Nadu. To give security to all of them in impossible. He isn't going to kidnap people who are in 24000 ration shops. He's going to kidnap 15 people amongst them who took excessive bribe. lf we find those 15 people, And if we send 2000 police men for their security, This time we can stop their attempt to kidnap. How can we find those 15 people? There's a way for that. Than others, who look bribe will know about it, right. lf they want to remain alive. We'll ask those 15 people to come to us on their own. More than the wealth they earned, They'll give importance to their lives and come here promptly. We'll announce this to all the ration staff of Tamil Nadu. Now we'll find those 15 people who're most corrupt. A counter has been opened at all district head quarters. There's a phone call from South Madras head quarters. First we've to find out who're those 15 people. Did anyone accept? Not 1 or 2, all of them have come here enmasse. Please come here immediately. Sir, l'm No.1 please give me security. lt's alright even if l lose my job. Save my life. Till today l've cheated Rs.86 lakhs. lf you don't believe please look into this file. Sir, please don't believe him, l'm No.1 . l looted loads of ration shop rice. They'll kill me if l'm outside. Please save me. Sir, we don't have ration shop in our area. Add me also into the list of 15 people. Please include me also in those 15 people whom you're going to give security. l'll give you 50 lakhs. Oh! don't you want me to be happy? Please be calm. What's this man? Everybody came here fearing that they're No.1 . This is only South Madras. lt seems North Madras & other places are crowded heavily. lt seems its traffic jam at Pudukottai. What happened sir? He diverted our attention to the ration department. And kidnapped 15 PWD officers. Just now we received the message. Hey close the gate, man. Collect the files. Sir, l didn't take any bribe. Let your files prove it! - You don't just accuse me. Under the circumstances of these sudden changes. What action are you going to take against them? lf the evidences in the files are proved. We'll take action against all these people. And within a week, we're going to appoint 25 youngsters as ration officer. What happened man? We've kidnapped 15 men from PWD, isn't it?- Yes... Gopi's father is also one of them. Does Gopi know about this? He doesn't know. Master, Gopi is coming. Master, an important good news for you. This's a magazine published in America. ln this, an article has come about our organization. That means, corruption plays a dominant role in lndia. There is a revolution in Tamil Nadu. And ACF, Anti-Corruption-Force has been established. ....And it is punishing corrupt officers. So, the entire Tamilnadu is getting rid of corruption. lf similar situation prevails in every state, Definitely, lndia will become a powerful country. They've written. They've published about our force in America. What a happy news is this. Master, what happened? Why're you looking dull? Master, l had never seen you like this before... What happened? Gopi, among 15 persons, whom we kidnapped from PWD. Your father is also one of them. Not only that, your father was No.1 corrupt. Master, what're you going to do now? Forgiveness is the starting point of any mistake. lf we forgive him this time... l would've mistaken you if you'd said, let's forgive your father. lt's alright, master. Tahsildhar, policemen, S.P... have also died.... They might've also had children, isn't it? lf we suffer from Diabetes, Even, if they are our legs won't we cut them? Master, l'll take leave. Master, while killing my father. ...Try to make it less painful... Master, he may a bad father. ...But...l....l... Master, l'm his good son.... l'm proud of you. All of them think college boys will always be roaming around girls. lt's only in the hands of students to change our country's destiny. How much? Rs.100 or Rs.150. Rs.35.60 Surprising it used to cost Rs.125 from Pallavaram to T.Nagar. You're asking only Rs.35? lsn't your meter working? No, only now, it's working properly. Earlier, l had to give money to R.T.O F.C. Brake lnspector & Traffic police. ln order to give money to all these people.... We used to charge Rs.125 for Rs.35 for a trip. Now, no one is taking bribe. We're also not charging excess fare. - Excellent. l didn't do anything great. A stranger who is staying somewhere. And who reforms all the officers. Only he gets the entire credit. l don't believe in God. But, if l get his photo, l'll keep it in my auto & worship him everyday. l can't...l can't... Not only Rs.3 Lakhs...Even if you give me Rs.30 Lakhs. l won't take bribe. lf you don't accept this money. Our boss will cut your hand. lf l don't accept this money. Your boss will cut only my hands. But, if l take bribe they'll kill me. lnstead of listening to the hand amputator. Will you listen to your executor? An officer was murdered for not taking bribe. Master, now, all the officers have reformed. Everything is going on correctly. But a new problem has cropped up. Rowdies & Goons are forcing officers to take bribes. Some reluctant officers have been killed. We had threatened to kill them if they took bribe. Similarly, they've threatened to kill them, if they don't.... lf this continues... A pickpocket may threaten P.O. and a criminal may threaten the Collector. When all the officers get reformed & not take bribe. lt's our duty to protect them. Gangsters who threaten officers & don't allow them to be honest. Collect their list from all over Tamilnadu. He may be of any religion. He may be anyones' relative. This's the list of Gangsters from all over Tamilnadu. Officers of each town. With their henchmen & powerful politicians. Are threatening people & doing business. For their crimes. Even police of that area are scared to take action against them. And these officers who've been tortured by them. This floppy has the names of top 15 of those criminals. This file has details of the top most of them. He's doing lot of business. He has suffered great loss since the officers had reformed. So, he's very keen to enforce bribe system again. Because of him, death rate of public & officers is increasing. That day, what we had seen in the paper was also done by his henchmen. We've to be very careful in this final move. Because, all of them are criminals. This time, there's no need to give prior information. That day, when you gave statistical data about Tamilnadu. l was surprised. But now, l'm happy. So many of them love you without even seeing your face. When l think that, l've moving with such a person. l feel proud of myself. But now, everything is alright. Can't you stop this? Again, why've you targeted another man? Forget it. You go away...lf l leave him, our efforts will go in vain. Again, he'll bring back the earlier situation. You're doing so much for the people. They don't know your whereabouts. Atleast, if they recognize you. There'll be a meaning for your efforts. Do you know who weaves your clothes? Do we know the name of the farmer who cultivates paddy for us? Do we know about the cobbler who makes our slippers? Do we know about the bus driver who drives us safely around? For our well-being.... Our Army men die every day in snow & desert. Do we know about them? We are not recognized by anyone. No one is grateful to us. Are they regretting about it? Similarly, this is also like that. Why're you so adamant? You talk so much. But, you don't know the worth of life? l know it's worth. That's why l'm talking like this. Because of him. Do you know, how many of them have died? Come... You ask me often whether l've anyone, children, family, don't you? Look.... Only she is left...Look.... Mother. Mother, l saw my brother. He's very handsome, folding his hands like this. l've kissed him also. But, he's black like father. He'll look like this only while scanning. When he's born, he'll be fair like you. No mother, let him be black. We both are fair & they're black.... lt'll be matching. Mother, dash against me once again otherwise, l'll grow horns. Your second issue is a male baby. Are you happy? Doctor, let the baby be of any sex. Mother & daughter were wishing for a baby boy. They're very much excited. Come & get the scan report on Monday. Shall we leave? Come on.... Chellam, go & get the key from Sharmie's house. Mother, l won't talk to her, she's my enemy. Please, go dear. For the forthcoming Deepavali l'll have a brother in my house. l already have my brother for the last 2 Deepavalis. l've asked you to get the key, what're you doing here? What? Haven't you become friends, yet? Sharmie, give me the key. Why do you apply Henna now? Pregnant lady wanted it. l don't know to draw. l've managed something, please adjust. Why're you laughing? My husband is applying Henna to me. Why do you bother? Why're you laughing again & again? Mother, it's not Henna, it's mint chutney! Father, has deceived you nicely. Oh God! Hubby. lt was just for fun.- Wait.... Wait. Are you telling the truth? - Yes, sir. Before we built that apartment. There was a pond which was filled up. So, that sand wasn't strong. We shouldn't have built such a big apartment building in that place. And it's not permitted also. You knew all these things earlier? Now, they're going to construct a bridge near that building. When they dig holes there, definitely that adjacent building will fall down. So? Sir, totally 72 families are there in those apartments. lf it crashes down everyone will die. Before that we've to inform them & we've to shift them elsewhere. Fool. lf l listen to you, we've to go to jail. We've built buildings in 6 places in the city. lf all of them shift their houses & ask for money. Where will l go? Even officers who took bribe from us will escape by making us scapegoat. But, if building falls down. First, those officers will be caught. lf they want to escape they've to prove this as an accident, right? Then, we'll also escape easily. Sir, what you're talking is business. - What l mean is humanity. Both are same for me. Even if my family was there among these 72 families. l won't bother. What's it? Father. Go to Selvamani uncle's house & bring newspaper. Father, l won't go to his house Sharmie is my enemy. What? That enemy... Call that Sharmie. What's it? Aunty. - Come here. l won't because Priya is my enemy. Uncle is calling you, come on. You both were best friends, right? What happened between you? Uncle, she had only first scribbled in my note book with a sketch pen. Father, she misplaced my compass first. So, l scribbled in her notebook. Have you become enemies for this silly reason? Okay, l'll buy a new notebook for you & l'll buy a new Geometry box for you. You both become friends. Crackers are bursting. And it's an enchanting festival. Sparklers are burning. Exciting, event has started. Rosy, let us learn to make sky happy. Think, to live happily. Children are flashing bright like lightening. Give garland of flowers to the smiling ones. The time when we light the lamps on earth. Our hearts get brightened. lf you say a word lovingly. The entire world will become your relative. When Gods have joined hands... Why should we discriminate ourselves? lf you've faith, there'll be growth. How can your life become dull? Let us swim in the rivers & drench in the rain. You fly like kites... Oh Cuckoo! spread your wings & sing... You prepare sweets & savouries for me. Let us burn crackers for grandma. Like the sky which never breaks. Don't back answer. Shall we tell ''Ambulimama'' stories? Shall we join the hands with Anjali? Without knowing this... Uncle, who is trying to dance... Don't try to get smart with us. Look at the saint shining bright with wisdom... A silk saree wearing, mother-in-law in Kashmir. Look at me... Look at me... Please, give her, sir. Tell me.. - Sir, please leave me. l had told him earlier itself. But that Badrinarayanan didn't listen to me. lt's true that there was a pond there earlier. They gave bribes to all the departments & managed it. Sir, here there's evidence of giving bribe to M.M.D.A. Sir, there's evidence of bribe paid to the soil tester. Sir, this file has all the details of bribes given to Chennai corporation. Velayudham, Chennai corporation. Shanmugam, officer of soil testing department. C.Madhavan, C.E.O, M.M.D.A. Senthil Kumar, Secretary, P.W.D. Parandhaman, l.A.S. District collector. Because of your inefficiency. Did you see how many have died? Till now, 212 people have died. 1 13 people are struggling for their lives in the hospital. Collector sir, already there was a pond in that place. They filled up that pond. Corporation registered that waste land. ....His department. Problems arose because they took bribes & approved it's registration. lt's true that we've registered it by taking bribe. Your department had taken soil test. Didn't that soil test reveal it? Knowing that, such a big building can't be built on that place. You too had taken bribe, & showed a bogus soil test report. Because of both your departments we too are getting bad name. Are you any honest man? You took bribe of Rs 20 lakhs & gave approval for the building... That man....he took bribe of Rs 40 lakhs & then only, he gave N.O.C. You're talking as if l've kept Rs 40 lakhs for myself. l gave Rs 25 lakhs to D.E., 7 lakhs to A.D., & 6 lakhs to A.E.O. Finally, all l got was only Rs 2 lakhs. What? ls enquiry in progress? Collector sir, you took Rs.5 lakhs for your daughter's medical seat from me. Have you forgotten? Why did l give you money? You should manage if such contingency arises. Sir, that Ramana... Are you shocked after hearing them? Collector himself is our customer. You can't do anything with this file. Here all are like this only. Can't you believe? l'll give you 2 chances. You can call & inform anyone in Tamil Nadu. ls it Commissioner's office? Yesterday many people died in an apartment collapse... There's a conspiracy behind it. Sir, l've all the evidence with me. ls it Secretariat? ls Home Secretary there? What? Did they say,'wrong number', didn't they? Didn't l tell you? l've given them money. l'll give you also. Those who died in that building. Government is giving Rs.1 lakh to each person. ln your house... You've a wife & daughter, haven't you? lf your child hadn't died in the womb. You would've got Rs 3 lakhs. Your bad luck that baby died before being born. So, it's not entitled. Okay leave it... l'll give you Rs 25 lakhs. Totally, you'll get Rs 27 lakhs... You marry again. There're so many tonics. You've strength, isn't it? Hey! don't you want money? Hey, send everybody out. Go out all of you. Lock the door. Someone's hurt on road, what happened? Come fast. Only Medical College students gave me life again. l never got an idea of killing those responsible for my family's death. This dastardly act mustn't get repeated again. They all should get reformed. l understood that only students can do it. So, l got my certificates again from the University. And joined as a Professor. l was the N.C.C. Master of the college also. l trained 200 students every year, And made them to join all Departments of Govt. of Tamil Nadu. This is that students revolutionary army. A peon who took bribe of Rs.30. Had leaked out the tender value of that building to Badrinarayanan. lf he hadn't accepted that Rs.30. He wouldn't have got this building contract. And apartments wouldn't have come up there. And so many people wouldn't have lost their lives. Bribe of Rs.10 taken by a person results in the death of a family elsewhere. This situation should change. But, he doesn't want the situation to change. Even now, people killed an officer who refused to take bribe. They were Badrinarayanan's men. You could've killed him in a second if you had wanted. You didn't do it. Even now you didn't kill him for your family's death. He'll bring the same situation as it was in the past. Your efforts shouldn't go in vain. Like the auto driver felt happy on that day outside the temple. Likewise, happiness of the poor shouldn't end half way. Hereafter, l won't stop you. Greetings, brother. Don't you know who l am? l was responsible for you to get this job. Were you responsible to get this job for me? Yes, we had only killed your predecessor. lt appeared in the news papers also, didn't you read? What do you want now? Just a signature in the file. That's all...we'll leave this place. Otherwise a new successor will come to sign it. That's all! For this, Rs.3 lakhs are in this. Keep them inside. l don't want money you can go. Has corruption disappeared? But fear hasn't. Shall l go now? See you. You've a long life. l can't believe it. Are they signing again by taking bribes? What're you saying? He didn't take money but signed it. This is just a beginning. Gradually, l'll bring back the earlier situation. l've to tell this to everyone. l'll call you later. Who's it? ls it Dindigul Mahalingam's house? Oh, is it you sir? Boss is missing for the past one hour. Don't know where he has gone and what has happened to him? l'll inform if he comes here. Sir, l'm calling from elderly man's house. Did he call you? No... He's missing for past one hour. Even his slippers are here, but he's missing. lt seems Mannargudi, Salem bosses are also missing for an hour. They say people who kidnapped officers are kidnapping gangsters. You also be little careful sir! The man whom you were searching desperately all these days. Are you surprised that he had come to you? Have you heard about A.C.F.? Of the 15 people, No.1 position is waiting for you. What're you looking at? Nobody, can save you. Couldn't believe it, could you? l'll give you 2 chances. You can call up anyone in Tamilnadu. l'm Badrinarayanan speaking. ACF Ramana has come to kidnap me. Sir, which number do you want? ls it Commissioner's office? No...this is commissioner's office. ls it Commissioner's office? - No, this is Commissioner's office. Somebody is asking whether this is a hotel. No...it's wrong number. They would've said ''it's wrong number'', wouldn't they? Not everyone is up for sale. Only snakes eat it's young ones to satiate their hunger. You should've reformed atleast after your son's death. But, you're trying to spoil the reformed State. You can never achieve it till l'm alive. Did you read the paper? lt seems, 15 gangsters have been kidnapped in Tamilnadu. l think, they'll hang that Aruppukkottai whisker man. How many people were terrorizing using one gangster's name? As soon they were kidnapped them, street boys became dormant. Even pick pocketers are keeping low profile. But, don't know who's behind all these things. They're investigating but they're unable to catch him. Hey you....a person from the sky should come down to catch him. What were you doing all these days? They've undertaken 3 operations till now. 3 officers have died. But there's no progress from our side. Above that, they've kidnapped 15 big shots. Do you think we, from central will be quiet? Put up posters all over Tamil Nadu. lf anyone knows about them or gives information about them, Announce a Government reward of Rs.20 Lakhs for them. Regarding the kidnapping incidents happening recently. And if you come to know about it's kingpin. When asked few people whether they would help in finding them... l won't give a hint. l won't...l won't. We'll not betray them. Why? Only now they're issuing rice & sugar properly in ration shops. Do you want to spoil that? Do you think can we give them general amnesty? l say they haven't done any crime, why amnesty? You'll catch a do gooder, do you want us to betray him? Yuck...take this and go. l've heard that everyone in Tamil Nadu are sentimental idiots. They hero worship criminals. l want to tell you something. Hey, haven't you gone out yet? Go out man. Get out....get out. l had gone out, that's why l could find out so much. Or else, l would be watching the slides everyday like you. They're watching the slides daily to see movies. They'll watch the slides & eat ''samosas'' & get a big paunch. They're treating this conference hall like a canteen. They couldn't find anything. lf you rely on them, not a.... Taking 15 days leave, l've found all this, losing half of my pay. l just asked them for a days' off. Didn't you ask me if l want to go out of the room or quit the job? You rubber face! This Tanjore doll nodded his head in concurrence. lmpossible sir. Don't talk as you wish. - Sir, he's... Go head. This is a vast network. lt isn't the power of terrorists but students' power. You've solved 90?/? of this case. What else is there? Give me a days' leave. l'll go to the National college & find out the culprit. No need of leave. You can go, on duty. l'll drive the jeep for you. Come. l've to make an important enquiry. l've to go in. Please give way. Why? To arrest & imprison a gentleman. We were happy that a faceless man is doing good from somewhere. But, we feel proud to know that he's from our college. Not even a single policeman can defy us and enter. Please, listen! Today is the 2nd day of the kidnapping. Even if there's a slight delay. They'll kill one of them tomorrow. Whom will they kill? ls he a Kamaraj or Nehru? No..they're going to kill a third rate rowdy, aren't they? Actually, it's your job. You'll catch everyone but a criminal. We must enter the college, right now. Till the last student is alive. lt's impossible. Sir, please wait. What're you going to do? l'm going to call entire city police force & drive them away. lf you beat a ruling party man, then, ruling party will retaliate. lf you beat an opposition party man even, they'll retaliate. But if you hit a student. Entire Tamil Nadu will retaliate. There's a big crowd behind him. Who doesn't have a crowd behind him in your State? lt's a crowd for everything. There's a crowd behind everyone. lf 10 people come behind him, they'll demand splitting Tamil Nadu. lf 100 people support, they'll ask for splitting lndia. They've killed Badrinarayanan. Modus Operandi is to kill on the 3rd day but now they've killed on 2nd day. Please come immediately to Royapuram harbour. Ugh! We saluted this man. They have killed him on the 2nd day itself. l'll not spare him. l'll not leave this place without catching him. l'll show him, what l'm. Hey? Why're you laughing? l'm really happy. What? He should've been killed on 3rd day but, they've killed him on 2nd day itself. Are you happy about that? We're winning, sir. Are we winning? Traditionally, they used to kill on the 3rd day. What does it mean if they kill him on the 2nd day itself? lt means, the path on which we're moving is right. lt means, we're just at an arm's length away from them. Fearing exposure on the 3rd day, they killed him on 2nd day itself. So, our next mission is to speed up the investigation. We couldn't enter the college, could we? No need sir, there's another idea. Go straight to the University. You're collecting the list of all alumni of National College. You're finding out their present jobs. And arrest them immediately, okay? l don't understand who's senior, he or me? ls he ordering me or am l ordering him? What sir? l don't understand who's the senior & who's ordering whom? We've to arrest everybody who're in that network. And give them a red room treatment. Atleast, one will squeal, unable to bear our tortures. SlRKAZHl. DHARAPURAM. THlRUVANNAMALAl. BHAVANl. TlNDlVANAM. VlRUDHACHALAM. Women too? Did anyone of them reveal his name? Name? They're not even shouting ''oh God'' even if we thrash them. Not one squealed? ls the treatment going on in other places? Treatment is going on in all the district headquarters. We're soft. Thirunelveli police will peel out the skin. We've a chance only there to get his name. Sir, call from Thirunelveli. ls it? Give me. l'm Palpandi speaking? Did anyone reveal his name there? Did anyone reveal his name there? No body is opening their month. - Thrash them nicely and ask. Fools, can't you people thrash them? They're enduring everything silently. What do you want us to do? What's this? We beat all of them as per your idea, not one named him. Why're you getting tensed up? l didn't ask you to thrash them so that they'll reveal his name. lf you hit them here it'll pain him there. For every blow here he'll bleed there. You watch out, he'll come out on his own. Sir, their parents, wives and children have come. Allow them inside. - Okay, sir. Watch out now. Sir, my son is inside. Please leave him.... l beg your pardon. Sir, please tell him. My son is inside. Not only your son... l'll release all of them. Ask him to reveal a man's name. Go....Go.... Brother... Brother... They've beaten him mercilessly. ls it paining? Dear son, please bear the pain dear. But, don't reveal his name. As wounds heal, pain will disappear. But, don't reveal his name. Are you mad? Your son is getting beaten up mercilessly. Are you a mother? Do you know him? Do you know if he's tall, short, fair or dark? You're asking your son to die for a faceless man. ls he more important to you than your son? Have you ever seen him? l've not seen him. Have you ever seen God? We, poor people are eating 3 square meals peacefully. Aren't you able to tolerate it? He's my only son, l never beat him even is his childhood. You hit him....But he won't reveal his name. lf your hands pain, hit him with a stick. But, he'll not reveal his name. He'll not reveal his name. Tamilians won't adore people so easily. lf they do, it'll last all their life. There're leaders who misused this adoration. But, there isn't a person here to deceive that leader. What's this, man? For some stranger, she's sacrificing her own son. So much of adoration. Who's he? l'm eager to meet him. Switch on the tape recorder. No need to trace out the phone number or to record my voice. l'll definitely surrender myself. But on 2 conditions... - Tell me, sir. You must release all old students unconditionally. 2nd one is all of them must be re-instated in their respective jobs. We want only you. They'll get back their jobs. You can trust me. Tell me, the place time and date when you're going to surrender. l'll note it down. A.C.F Leader is going to surrender tomorrow. Place of his surrender isn't mentioned in the paper. Hey, l want to see his face... Give me that paper. lt isn't there in this paper too. - Give me an lndian express, please. His place of surrender isn't mentioned in any paper. Place isn't mentioned even in T.V. News. People, haven't seen him, please tell us his place of surrender. Please permit us to do our work. Please give us way. Where's he going to surrender? Go...Go... Didn't l ask you to keep out all receivers? Okay, attend the call. Sir, Home Minister wants to talk to you. Ask him the matter. He's asking, what's the matter? He's asking about the place of his surrender. Tell him, you can't say and hang up the phone. Why're you not revealing it to the Home Minister also? No man...Only after we hand him over to the special court. We'll be relieved from this case. Nobody has seen his face till now. So, there'll be a huge crowd to see him. They may get angry towards police and it may lead to violence. That's why, l didn't reveal the place & time of his surrender. SPEClAL COURT, CHENNAl. Breaking news. Since, ACF Leader Prof. Ramana has accepted his crime in the special court. Court has sentenced him to death. Sir, C.M has come to meet you. What a great service you've done l feel bad to see you in this state. l've written a mercy petition to President for amnesty. Sign this. l'll see to that you're pardoned. Pardon. Whether its wrong or right. l'm responsible for 4 deaths. Beginning of the mistake is pardon. End of the mistake is punishment. Fear of punishment has made things to go smoothly. lf you pardon me, then that fear will disappear. l don't want set a bad precedent myself. Even my death should send shivers down their spines. l joined politics at the age of 20 with an intention to serve people. But l couldn't. That leader will criticize if we do some good to people. We criticized his work. We became old by spending our lives fighting & protecting our posts. The thing which l wanted to do at the age of 20. l couldn't do it even at 70. But, you've done it. The price of rice which was Rs.16 has come down to Rs.7 now. You are responsible for that not me. You're such a good person and how to... lt's enough you took pains to meet me. l don't want anything else. lt a man dies and if his mother cries. He's a good son. lf his children cry, he's a good father. lf his siblings cry, he's a good brother. lf an entire nation cries on his death. He's a good leader. This world is crying for you, dear. My grandson hasn't eaten anything for 2 days. Why do you think that you've killed them? Think that they were sentenced to death by the court for their crimes. Even if the court sentences them to death. Aren't they breaking the pen used for writing the judgement? l'm the pen used for writing the judgement. lt must be broken. Sir. Do one thing for me. l want to see my children once. l've told them that you've gone out of station on some urgent work. They always remember you. l've answered everybody. l don't know, how to answer these children. Children who've lost their families in their childhood itself. They'll become orphans again. Even if a plant uprooted and sown elsewhere. Along with the root, it'll take some mud also. They don't have even that. Without me....now.... They shouldn't know that l'm going to die. Tell them that, l've gone abroad. Let them live in the hope that someday, l'll come back. God gifted me children twice. But not even once l was fortunate to live with them. You take care of them. They don't know anyone else other than you. lf they commit any mistakes. They'll listen to you if you advise them. Please, don't beat them. One minute please. Nothing. Release Ramana. Release Professor. There're 8 Universities in Tamil Nadu. Students of all college are entering the city. Situation is going out of control. lf this condition continues. When Prof. Ramana is hanged. Large scale violence may erupt. Only Professor Ramana can control them. lf he talks to the public before his punishment. They'll calm down. We can also execute the punishment without trouble. Till now, public hasn't seen him. We can control the public only if he addresses them for the first time. Call the press immediately. For the first time... No...for the last time he's going to appear before the public. Ask them to publish this news. Did you get your promotion? - No sir. Bribe was responsible for me to remain a constable though l'm qualified. Even l know that pain very well. You didn't allow others to get affected like me. l've...You.... lf l had been a student of National college. l would've been your follower, trust me. Professors will bid adieu to the students on their farewell. For the first time, all the students have come to bid adieu to this professor. l'm really proud of you! Students are the only section beyond all castes, religion,language barriers. Example of student power is that it can change fates of nations. Each and every student is like fire. Only fire has the power to burn anything that comes into its contact. lf all these fires join together lndia will became a raging fire. What does lndia lack? Everything is there. One lndia is equal to 72 Singapores. One lndia is equal 15 Englands. One lndia is equal to 4 Pakistans. One lndia is equal to 3 Americas in population. American population is 28 crores. lndias' population is 102 crores. When there is a Edison, Bill Gates Abraham Lincoln for just 28 crores. For 102 crores...No need of 3 Bill gates. Thers's not even one here. Why? Because Abraham Lincoln who was a cobbler became the President of America. l don't know how many Abraham Lincolns are still mending shoes here. Why couldn't we achieve that? Money! Money is responsible for everything. After all even in a game... Bribe is involved. Every country would be achieving to win medals in Olympics. But we lndians are yearning to see atleast our name in the medal list. Why? Don't we've talented people here? We've many times over. When they were wandering tribes, we ran Governments here. When they didn't have a language. We had many poets here. Why isn't that growth here now? Money! Bribe! He's taking bribe to give others. Someone else is taking bribe to give him. Only students have the power to stop all this rot. This isn't a struggle between officers and students. But this is a struggle between students and students. lt isn't compulsory that a politician or a terrorist should be a student. But an officer should definitely be a student. They were students. But you all are future officers. Only you are going to become Tahsildars, SP's Collectors in future. You decide how your society should be. After my death, don't burn shops and buses etc., Then there won't be any difference between students and politicians. Not even a match stick should burn for me. Fire should burn only in your hearts.
