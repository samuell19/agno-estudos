How was that? That was amazing. I mean, I was just trying to do some justice to the song. Who sings the demo? It doesn't matter. This song has been waiting for your voice. It's time to let the world hear it. Yeah. He shoots. He shoots. He's scores! Tammy. Sorry, I couldn't help it. You're so cute. I'm putting it away. Dinner is ready. Oh, just a few more shots. Steph Curry shoots 300 shots a day. And that's just after practice, so I gotta do it. Well does Steph Curry have a science project due tomorrow? Dad. Jay, listen to your mother. Fine. Whatever. Well, we've been through this over and over again. Why do we keep going back and forth? Jay is happy here. I don't care. No, no. We- Let me call you back. What's going on? Deidra wants full custody of Jay. Well? She makes a few valid points. Pam. Looks like she's completed parenting classes. Steady job and her own place. And it's true, you both have a hectic schedule. Plus you moved twice in three years. So? A lot of people have hectic schedules and people move, so what? It means that Jay had to change schools twice. And what I see, she's not attacking you, Charles. Her claim is Jay needs a mother. I can have a petition filed in with the court by close of business today. No, no courts. All right, she sent me a personal letter for a reason. She's up to something. The press finds out that there's a custody battle brewing, We need other options. Charles, you do know that I don't work for you? You married my sister. I'm only trying to help. Pam, please. He's sorry. What are our options? Reason with her. Excuse me. Excuse me, miss, miss. Excuse me, miss, excuse me? Excuse me, miss. - Deidra, Deidra. - Excuse me? Hello? ♪ You and I you and I Deidra. Deidra, what are you doing? "You and I" will be released tomorrow and every urban black radio station in the country will be picking it up. Tammy, did you hear what I just said? She should have been here 30 minutes ago, Charles. This is just her way of defining the terms. All right, it's what she does. How could you be so calm about all of this? Well, because you're nervous enough for both of us. Look, now I'm open to many things, but giving up my son is not an option. I know we agreed to leave our past in the past, but what happened between you and Deidra? Deidra. Charles. Where's Jay? He has this little basketball ritual he's obsessed with these days. I mean, I can go get him. That's right, the Steph Curry thing. He told me about it. No, it's fine. I think we need to talk. Okay. I was hoping that we could speak alone, 'cause what needs to be said shouldn't be said in front of um, mixed company. Whatever we need to talk about can be said in front of Tammy. Charles, it's okay. You guys should talk. So we're alone just like you wanted. Let's talk. Uh. You seem to have done pretty well for yourself since our divorce. Can't help but wonder if our little breakup inspired some of these hits. Deidra. Kidding. I am. You're a great producer. That's why I fell in love with you. But you married a star. She's not me, but she's a star nonetheless. Look, I thought you wanted to talk about Jay. We are talking about Jay. I've been doing better, and so now I think it's time for me to be the mother Jay needs me to be. And that's why I'm allowing you to spend time with Jay. Now after the hospital discharged you, I knew it was important for Jay to see his mother, but why full custody? I mean, his life is stable. I'm his mother and I know what's best for him. Then why haven't you been here? It's been me and Tammy, not you. Tammy isn't his real mother. She's gotta go on tour. She's gotta record. He's my blood and not hers. This is our family. And Tammy is a part of that now, Deidra. But can you do it without me? Look at this room. Look, the awards, the prestige. There's not an ounce of me in it. I am not gonna apologize for my success. You erased me. But you're not gonna erase me from Jay's life, too. A boy needs his mother. Let's start with a few sleepovers. Can we do that? It's a start. Mama. - Hi baby. - Hey. You ready to go? I have to get my bag. Okay, um, where's your dad? You know dad, some trip. He'll be home tomorrow. So you're alone with Tammy? Yeah, Tammy and Aunt Pam are out back doing yoga. I can go get them. Nope, don't. Just go get your bag. I have a lot of surprises planned for you this weekend, mister. Okay, um, you wanna see my room? I shouldn't. It's cool, they won't mind. Come on. Come on. I'm proud of you, sis. The whole family is. Thank you. You know it doesn't even feel really yet. It will. And when it does, I'm here to negotiate your new contract. Thank you. I'm just happy you're here. Sometimes I feel like the third wheel around this place. I thought Mr. Right treated you like gold. No, it is not that. It's Deidra. She haunts this place, and if I even mention her, Charles completely shuts down. What do you think? I love it. Um, you know what? I think we should go to someplace fancy for dinner. Why don't you grab a jacket, an extra outfit, and something nice. You think you can do that? Mom, this is me you're talking to. Okay then. Go and uh, get something really nice. No basketball jerseys. Okay. Take your time. What do you know about her? Uh, not much. Just that when Charles filed for divorce, she took it really hard and disappeared when Jay was younger. She disappeared? I guess. But she is back now and she appears to be stable and she's ready to be a mom again, so I'm happy for her. Truly, I am, because when she's good, that means that Jay's good. But aren't you curious about what happened? Nah. I have to respect that, you know? Let the past be the past. What about you? What about me? As long as Jay's under this roof, Deidre's gonna be coming around. You need to know what you're up against. What does that mean, "Up against?" If I was her, I'd wanna know everything about the woman around my kid. Especially if she's about to become the biggest star in the world. Mama. What are you doing in dad's room? I was looking for the restroom. Oh, okay. Come on, let's go. You know, I just want Deidra to respect me and the way I care for Jay, like I respect her. Besides, I wanna have kids of my own one day. Well, if she keeps disrespecting my sister, I will show her how real of a sister I am. Ooh. I'll stomp a hole in her real quick. What? I'll knock her teeth out. Don't get me started. Uhn-uh T. Uh, okay, so look, I told Jay that I, I could have stayed in the car. If I overstepped. Oh no, please, Deidre. Don't be silly, we're- - Thank you for allowing me to take my child for the weekend. Um, you know what? I wanna apologize about the other day. I'm truly grateful for everything that you've done for my child. Is there any way that we could just, I don't know. Can we start over? I'd like that. Cool, how about tonight? Tonight? Um... Yeah, my liquor cabinet, it stays open pretty late. Tonight may not work, only because- - Oh, I get it, that's right. You probably have a bunch of text messages to read. It's okay, it's cool. Come on baby, let's go. Wait. How late does your liquor cabinet stay open? It's not much, but um, Jay has his own room and it's in a good school district. Um, I think it's great. Let's do this. Let's. So how did you meet Charles? Uh, my sister, Pam. Pam. Cute. Yeah, it's actually a really funny story. So they were- A toast. Okay. What are we toasting to? You, silly. Your song, it's amazing. It's the prettiest song that I've ever heard. Thank you, Deidra. I almost feel like I have a connection to it. Hmm. No, it's funny you say that because I felt the same exact way when I heard it. You heard it? Yeah, the demo. Charles had written it years ago, and when I heard this song, I just knew I had to sing it. So he never released it? Uh-uh, he said he could never find the right voice for it, till now. What exactly did Charles tell you about me? What does anybody ever tell anyone about their ex? - Fair enough. - Mm. Well, we met when I was in my second year in college and he had just had this serious breakup with Jessica Dawson. Jessica Dawson. By that look, you've heard that name before. She really broke his heart. But her loss was my gain, right? And I was in school for computer graphics, but he saw right through. He knew I wanted to make music. So you sing. Dabbled. You know Charles, he makes you feel like a star. Mm. He used to keep his uh, his songs in these journals. Yeah, he still does that. And we would go to the studio and we would record these amazing love songs. But then it led to more love making than making music. I think sex inspires him. And then Jay was born and uh, there was no more time for music. At least that's what he told me. So is that why you stopped? We both did. We got married and we tried to make the family thing work. He went back to work at a old manufacturing plant. I went back to school and we really tried, and we were a family, until we weren't. He didn't tell you that, did he? Uh, no. Just that I'm a crazy mama that abandoned her kid. No, Deidre, he never said any- - I had so much love for him, for our family, until he got arrested. That was the beginning of the end. Arrested? I've said too much. No, you haven't said enough. What was he arrested for? Whatever happened with us is in the past. He's with you now. Yeah, but he never told me any of this. I'm not gonna start any more trouble than I already have. He's found his way back to his music. He's happy. You're happy. And Jay's happy. I had a lawyer draw those up and I signed them. I realized that there was no upside for a waitress up against a successful music producer in court. Take it. Besides, a custody battle is no way to start a healthy co-parenting relationship. Wow, Deidra. Thank you. This was fun. It was. We should do it again. Oh, by tomorrow, you will be so famous you won't remember that cheap wine I served you. Oh, from me, your lips to God's ears. And that wine was not that cheap, Deidra. That's just Renegade, the neighbors dog. It's, he's harmless. He don't sound that harmless. You get used to it. Oh. And what has got you smiling so hard? It's not a what, it's a who. Oh. Who? Some guy. He uh, wants me to send him a naughty pic. Ooh, do you like him? Yeah, maybe, I don't know. Hey, do it, okay? You only live once. What, is he cute? You'll see him soon enough. Okay. Well um, I should get going, but I'm really glad we got the chance to do this. Likewise. Thank you, Deidra. You, uh, tell Charles to stay outta trouble. Tammy. Tammy, why aren't you ready? We have a meeting with Satellite Radio at 11 o'clock. All right, this industry doesn't give second chances. We can't blow this. You know, that's funny, because you got a second chance. What? I went and saw Deidre last night. Why would you do that? You know, probably for the same reason you never told me why you were arrested. Look, baby. Look, do not "baby" me. What the hell? Look, it's the past, all right? She's the past. All right, let it go. Why didn't you tell me that she sings, or anything about her for that matter? Or should I let that go, too? What else are you hiding from me, Charles? It's not what you think. Look, I did it for Jay. Okay, I kept secrets for him. All right, look. I was arrested for assault. All right, some guy said I hit him after I saw him and Deidra flirting. I got jealous and confronted him. And did you hit him? No, no, but the police didn't believe me. I was a hothead back then and it wasn't the first time I was in trouble with the law. Not your first time? Look, our relationship was toxic. She reveled in the drama. Yeah, but why didn't you tell me? Well, I had my record expunged. Right, I paid a PR team to erase me and Deidra's internet history because I didn't want Jay to know he had a father that was a criminal and a mother who went to a mental health institution. Oh. I bet she left that part out, too. Well, did she sing? Did she sing? Yeah, a little. But she wasn't a star. Not like you. Charles, I am your wife. Do you know how stupid I felt? It's like I don't even know you. Now you know me. So does Deidra and Jessica. Look, I know I betrayed your trust in the past, and I know I don't deserve it, but I'm asking you, look Tammy, you're raising my son. Hell, I won't pretend that I can do this without you. No more secrets, Tammy. Okay, I promise. Deidra's not seeking full custody anymore. She's okay with co-parenting. Well, well how? I mean. Does it matter? It's done. Hey, I mean, I don't know what to say. I mean, I'm just- - You know what, Charles, just, promise me you'll be honest with me from here on out. Baby, I promise. What is it? Charles' file is sealed, but the other guy's file isn't. Jimmy Franklin, a real shit bag. Habitual criminal with more assault charges than he has birthdays. How will this help me get to the truth? Charles didn't do it. He didn't? Page six, superstar. What is this I'm looking at? It's a transcript from a criminal case where Jimmy was a state star witness. The defense attorney raised concerns about his credibility as a witness. He cites Charles's case as his reason. Hmm. Jimmy Franklin knowingly and willingly pressed false charges on Charles Harper only to drop his claim after his allegations could not be corroborated. Why would he do that? Why does any man do what he does for a woman? I gotta go. I have this IG Live thing I have to do, but thank you. You're amazing. Wait, be careful. That woman isn't playing with a full deck. According to our records, you and Ms. Deidre Love conspired against Mr. Harper. We're ready for you in five, Ms. Wilson. I'll, I'll be right there. Hey guys, so I'm gonna answer some questions. What inspired "You and I?" I would say love, pure, unfiltered love. And when I recorded it, it was my hope that you guys, my fans, walk away feeling that same love. Unbelievable. We need to talk. In my office, now. That doesn't matter. Look, we should be already on the next single. Hell, the next three singles. Tammy is a star. The industry hasn't seen an artist like her in over 10 years. Yeah, but we need something new, something fresh, something vibrant, and have her- - We need to talk. This is an important call and I don't wanna fight. So you think your little Instagram post is gonna butter me up? Um, I'm gonna have to call you back. Cupcakes for lunch. Don't tell your dad. Never, this is perfect. I thought you might say that. So what's it like? Living with a superstar? Who, Tammy? She's okay. Okay? It's gotta be more than okay. Doesn't she go to like award shows and parties with celebrities and? Nah, it's not like that. Huh? What's it like? She's mad Cool. Like super normal. She goes to my games even when dad can't. Growing up pretty fast, mister. Even got your own key. I'm not a kid anymore. Dad said it gives me responsibility. And he's very right. Let's see what else you got on the court. Let me see your three point, Mr. Big Time. All right. Was that all net? Nice one. What are you doing, mister? Going through old studio sessions. You know, the label's thinking about doing a behind the scenes documentary. Oh. Wait, oh my God. Stalker. How many videos do you have? I record every session. Do you ever stop working? Doing music inspires me. You inspire me. I don't deserve you. I'll get that. I'll get you some food. - Okay. - All right. Jessica Dawson. Oh baby. I thought we could discuss the photo shoot tomorrow after lunch. What is this? Open it. What is it? You tell me. Open it. Jessica Dawson? This, this is a mistake. Open it, Charles. All right. All right, someone's playing some kinda sick game. I don't know what this is. Well then show me. Show me the joke. Baby. Baby, I don't know what this is. Don't you see how crazy this looks? No, your past is what's crazy, Charles. - Read it. - No. No, this is insane. Why would anyone send me sex toys? Let's find out. "My dearest Charles." "No matter how hard we try to resist" "we keep finding our way back to each other." "Last week was no different." "I can't stop thinking about you." "Forever locked in." "Love, Jessica?" Look, that's a lie. I haven't seen Jessica in years. Tammy. Tammy. Tammy, we need to talk about this. Tammy. Why are we leaving? I was just warming up. I know, baby. I just, I have some errands to run. Rain check? Tammy, can you please just open the door? Unlock the door. Let's talk about this. Look, you know me. None of this makes any sense. Just think about it. Okay, look, my phone. My, my phone is by the bed. You can check it yourself. Go on, check it. What's the password, Charles? It's Jay's birth year. Well say something. "Can't wait to see you." "Keep the cuffs, I have the key?" What? That doesn't even make sense. Ready? Why did we stop here? Well, you're old enough to have a key to your dad's house. I think you are responsible enough to have a key to mine. I mean, ours. You have two houses now. Where you going? Out of my way. I can't stand to be in this house around you anymore. Because of an unknown number? Do I really look this stupid? Do I? Let's talk about this. You know, why is it the only time you're willing to talk about your past is when it's blowing up in your face, Charles? Tammy, Don't say my name. Tammy. Can we? Baby. Let's think about this, all right? Jessica doesn't know where we live. Why would she do this? This has Deidre written all over it. Look, I don't care who did it. I'm getting sick and tired of you and your ex's, Charles. I can't even look at you right now. Well- Dad. Son. You stay, I'll go. He wanted to come home early. It's just been a lot. Girl, it's gonna be okay. But what's really going on? Well, Charles is staying at a hotel, and Jay is with Deidra. Oh Tam, your husband is famous. And with the hit new song, all his ex's will probably come out of the woodwork. Well, he needs to get ahead of that. It is not my job to manage his past. That's his job. Now that sounds like a bar for your next single. Stop. I can stay as long as you want. Oh, that's okay. I kind of wanna be alone. But thank you for listening to me. Of course. "My dearest Charles." "No matter how hard we try to resist," "we keep finding our way back to each other." "Forever locked in." "Love, Jessica." Hi, this is Charles Harper. Please leave a message. Hey, uh, Charles, can you gimme a call back? It's, it's important. Pam. Hey girl. Tam, is something wrong? Um, I don't know yet. I can't get a hold of Charles. You're sounding off. I saw something and it could just be a weird coincidence, but something is not adding up with that package. I need to do some digging. Do you need me to come over? No, I'll come to you. I'll see you soon. Hey, Tammy. I know I'm early. I couldn't wait. You know, your pictures don't do you justice. Why are you in my house? Whoa, ho ho, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy, girl. It's me, Zeeke. I don't know who you are. Get out of my house! Dating site. Brooding scorpio, lonely housewife looking for some fun. Come on, you've been texting me and begging me to come here. Bullshit. Tammy, don't chicken out now. Come on, I drove a long way just to be here. What are you doing? What are you doing with this phone? What, what do you doing with that? What do you think you're doing, huh? Wanna start playing rough, huh? Is that what it is? You wanna start playing now? I guess we're getting into it right away. No! Shh. I know you said you like it rough, but, I didn't imagine this good. Shh, you're feisty. But I like that. Are you gonna be a good girl? Are you going to be a good girl? Yeah? I mean, I'm just following your lead. Now you're gonna follow mine, right? Yeah? Good. This is fun, isn't it? Yeah. Hey, where do you think you're going, huh? This was your idea. What are you talking about? So here I am. Let's play, huh? What? What? Damn it, Zeeke, I said no calls. Deidra? Miss Wilson? I told you everything already. I told you about the call and I do not have a My Gaze Only account. I promise to look into all of that. But I have a hard time with one part of your story. Okay? He knew your address. Photos were taken of you. Text messages. Yeah, they were all fake. I'm trying to tell y'all, it's Deidra. I have never used an app like that before in my life. But this man had a key. Was that also fake? The alarm wasn't on. Is there a reason for that? Because it's a safe damn neighborhood. This, whatever this is, is over. Excuse me? Excuse me, I'm Pam Newman, I'm her attorney. I'm taking a statement. Sounds to me like you already have it. I'm collecting facts. Well, let me tell you one fact you do know. A man broke into the home. No, he entered the home with a key. And attacked my client and she defended herself, which is her right. So if you're not sure what you need from my client, leave. And call me when you make a decision. We'll be in touch. You don't speak with no one without me again. Do you hear me? I'm not going to let anything happen to you. It's gonna be okay. Tammy? Oh baby, are you okay? I tried calling you. Oh, I know. I'm sorry. How are you? Detectives think I invited him in. Look, baby, I don't want you to worry about any of that. We're going to take care of it, I promise, all right? You need to get her out of here. Yeah, I know. The media catches wind of this it's gonna be a circus. Can we take your car? Yes, but we're going to need to make a statement. I'm, I'm on it. We need something now before someone else creates the narrative. I'll figure it out. No, I'll handle it. You just get her as far away from here as possible. I know a team that can clean up the crime scene while we're away. Just stop, stop. I'm not leaving. We can't stay here. So what, I'm supposed to go out there? You think that's gonna bring me peace of mind? Tammy. This is not a crime scene. This is our home and I will not be run away. Someone was in here. Now we need to think smart about this until I can hire a security team. I mean, what if there's another deranged fan out there? This wasn't a fan. It was Deidre. Deidra? Yes. Look, the pictures were all fake. Yes, it was my face, but it was not my body. That doesn't mean it was her. Crazy fans make fake photos all the time. What about the call? You didn't hear her voice. Yeah, but my bangle and, and, and lingerie. It was missing. Tammy. So y'all think I'm crazy. No, but we can't rock the boat with Deidre or anyone right now. And making accusations we can't prove can backfire on us. You're a person of interest in a crime. A crime that could sent you to jail for the rest of your natural black life. If Deidre is behind this, tipping her off right now that you suspect something isn't going to help. So what, huh? What, you, you, you saying I should do nothing? I'm saying let me do my job. Let, let us fix this, all right? Let me worry about Jay and we'll get through this together. All right? Mmhm. It's gonna be okay. She's doing okay. Tonight was a difficult night. Tammy is resting comfortably surrounded by the people who love her. Tammy's not only a celebrity, but she's a loving wife and mother. - You lying bitch. - We ask for privacy during this difficult time. - Ain't nobody's mother. - Thank you. It's a lie. Everyone on the internet is saying that Tammy killed someone. Oh no, it's true, baby. I think I need to be with them. No, no, you're safe. You're safe here with me. But Tammy needs me. She's always been there for me. She needs you? She need a God damn lawyer. She not thinking about you right now. I'm going home. You are home. No, I'm calling dad. He's busy. His wife just murdered somebody and she's facing jail time for the rest of her life. She's not thinking about you. You should appreciate the fact that I'm trying to keep you here safe. You acting just like your damn daddy. It's better than acting like you. Jay? Shit. Can I help you? I'm Detective Fletcher. Oh, now is not a good time, Officer. What, what's this about? Just need to ask a few questions. About? Are we able to go inside? I'm on my way to work. That's odd. You no longer work there. I checked. How may I help you? It's about your ex-husband. Is this about last night? I was here with my son, and I'm afraid I don't know anything. How about I come back at a later time? That would be best. Mom? Go to your room. What is that? Go to your room. Baby, I'm sorry. I would never do anything to hurt you. What you saw is not what you think you saw. And you're right about Tammy. She didn't kill anyone. What you saw in the room was me trying to help the police. They asked me to help. I know this is scary, but I was just doing my part trying to help. I'm sorry. They said somebody might be trying to hurt me, too. I will never let anything happen to you. I'll protect you. That's my baby. Now what do we do? We stick together. You and me. They've been out there all night. I'm working on that. I'll get the media to back off. It's just, I know Deidre's behind this. Anybody with eyes can see that, but me having a law agree is advising you to see what I see. And what is that? The police will subpoena Deidre's internet provider for her IP address's activity. It'll be all over soon. She's done. It doesn't feel that way. I need a favor, from Detective Pam. What do you mean Jay doesn't want to come home? No, let me talk to him. I tried calling him all night. He's not answering his phone. Just put him on the phone, Deidre. What? I don't need to calm down. What? You can't do that. Hello? Deidre. Damn it! How long you been standing there? Long enough. Go, you need to see him. I'm, I'm not leaving you. I am not a porcelain doll. Jay needs you, go check on him. Where's Jay? Excuse me? Where is he? We're leaving. Wait, he, wait. He wants to stay. I don't have time for this. Jay, Jay. Calm down, calm down. Look, I'm not letting you in here until you calm down. We are going to speak as adults. That boy is scared enough as it is already. How did you get these so fast? I don't disclose my techniques. Wow they look so real. It's a deep fake. She's crazier than I thought. Yeah, but why? Charles was open to having her be in Jay's life. I just... Something must have triggered her. It's the prettiest song that I've ever heard. I feel like I have a, a connection to it. You know what? Let me call you back. Are you really gonna keep me from my son? What the hell are you doing, Deidra? What am I doing? Uh, someone was killed in your house, and you really want him to go back to that? Then we'll leave. Oh, okay. He'll love that. Another move in the middle of the school year. And let me guess, being with you was the only solution? Last time I checked, no one died in my living room. Jay is a child. He needs time to process. He's safer here. He's safe with me. That's not good enough for me. Not good enough, for you? I'm doing what's best for my son. By brainwashing him against me? Last time I saw your wife, she was leaving with a suitcase, and the next day she's killing someone. Your house is unstable, and it's been like that for a minute. I'd be happy to talk to the press about my concerns. Oh, so this is what it comes down to? Okay, let's cut the bullshit. What do you want? I want our son safe. I'm looking out for him. Someone has to and clearly Tammy can't do that. This isn't about Tammy. This is about you and me. You made it about Tammy when you gave her our song. Song? What, what, what are you talking about? You're crazy. And your wife is a killer. You sure know how to pick 'em, Charles. ♪ Love me right, love me right, do me right ♪ ♪ Why do you, hold me tight, never lie, you're right ♪ ♪ You and I ♪ You and I, you and I ♪ You and I, you and I I'm not leaving without my son. Can I at least collect his things and explain to him why he has to go? Okay. Wait here. Hey, is everything okay? Charles, Deidre sang the demo for "You and I?" No, I mean, yeah, yeah. Look, it's complicated. Uncomplicate it for me. Tammy, it's not what you think. Enough with the cryptic talk. Look, all right, we played around with the song in the studio once, like 13 years ago. It wasn't for a demo, right? It was for us. We were just being silly, it was nothing. Yeah, but it was everything to Deidre. You know, in her mind, she thinks that I'm singing her song. The song that you wrote for her family. The family that I'm a part of now. Look, I didn't expect- - I told you to promise me that you would always be honest with me about your past. And here I am finding out another secret you hid from me. I'm sorry. Your sorry's are starting to become meaningless, Charles. Let me know when you and Jay are on the way. Tammy. Damn. Jay, let's go. Is dad mad? No, but we're leaving, let's go. Where to? I don't have time to answer any of your questions. Let's go. Just leave it. But what about dad? Boy, you'll be with your dad soon, I promise. The police tracked the IP address back to Deidra. An arrest warrant has been issued. They're on their way now. So it's over. When she's arrested, I'll issue a press release and you can rebuild your family, and all of this will be over. I'm gonna call Charles, but I love you, sis. Thank you. I love you, too. Tammy? Charles? Baby, you don't sound too good. Charles, speak to me. Are you okay? I don't know. I think, I think Deidra hit me. What? She's lost her mind. Okay, are, are you okay? Where's Jay? I don't know. Jay? Jay?! Charles, what is going on? She has Jay. Call the police, now. How is your burger? Why are we here? There's a lot of people that don't wanna see us together. And Miss Pam is a lawyer and she's gonna help us. Then why don't we just go to Aunt Pam's house? I know where it is from here. It's too dangerous. She's gonna meet us here. It's been over an hour. How much longer do we have to sit out here for? You know I love you, right? And I would never let anything or anyone hurt you. I refuse to let that happen. Okay. Mommy's gonna go away for a while. I'm coming with you. No, not this time. But you said it yourself. I need to protect you. And you have done a wonderful job. Where are you going? It's not important. But what is important is that we got a chance to spend some time together. Okay, mom. She's waking up. Could you go get a nurse? Okay. Where am I? There's been an accident. - I got it. - Relax. I don't remember anything. Deidre's behind this. I know she is. She's desperate. She took Jay and ran, she's, you know, I'm afraid to think of what she's even capable of. You don't remember anything? I can't remember. I wish I could remember anything to bury the bitch. It's okay. How do you feel? I'm okay. Okay, careful. So there's nothing more you can do? Sir, we're doing all we can. All you can? My wife told you that Deidra was behind us from the beginning. If you had arrested her, none of this would be happening. That's not the way it works, Mr. Harper. I understand your frustration. Do you? Because I don't think you do. My son is missing. Someone is in the hospital. I was almost killed and my wife was attacked. You don't understand shit. Should I answer it? - Yeah. - Put it on speaker. Hello? Do we have an audience? Yes. Take me off speaker, just you. Look, I need to hear everything. I will tell you everything. Just please let me handle this. This could be our only chance. Just keep her on the phone for as long as you can. Are you there? Um, yeah, I'm, I'm here. Jay wants to talk to you and I want this to be over. Is he safe? Let's just end this. Woman to woman, just you and me. If you do anything stupid, you won't ever get to see Jay again. Get rid of them and call me back. How am I supposed to do that? You're a smart girl, figure it out. Okay, well, where are you? Listen clearly, I don't care what you say to them. You get rid of them fast, and call me when you're in your car alone Yeah. So what'd she say? She said that she's at the old manufacturing plant. That you would know where that is. So she's there now with Jay? Yeah, she's ready to turn herself in. She, she has Jay. Well, why didn't she call me? Why you? I don't know, Charles. The manufacturing plant. Do you know about this? Yeah, yeah, I know where it is. It's, it's an old plant where I worked when we were married. I need to move on this now. No, no, no, look, I need to be there. No, I need you here if something goes wrong. I will call you when we have your son. Thank you, Detective. Baby, are you okay? No, I'm, I'm worried about Jay. I can't stop thinking about Pam. This is hard. I know, I know, babe. You know Pam, she's tough. Listen, why don't you go be with your sister? All right, there's no sense in her being alone. I'll call you when I hear something. - Okay. - All right? Okay, I'm alone. How'd you do it? He's a man. He needed to be the hero, so I let him. Now let's end this. Deidra. ♪ Running out of time, I can't wait ♪ ♪ 'Cause I'm afraid Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. Just listen. ♪ I cannot replace Charles used to write the most beautiful songs. When we met, he could barely afford a session at this place. Now he owns it. Charles has everything. This studio, a beautiful wife, my son, and our song. What do I get, huh? Answer me! Where is Jay? Oh, you think I would hurt my son? He's fine. I told you, this ends with you and me. ♪ Never did this before, I know I want more ♪ We're toxic. I'm crazy, apparently, but you're a murderer. Not the best role models for my child, but Charles can start over. Maybe he'll do better next time. One hell of a song, huh? ♪ 'Cause I got you, if you got me ♪ Let's see how hot she really are. You're crazy. I'm right here, bitch. Sing, sing now, bitch. Sing about how you stole my life. You cannot have what I built! Do it. Do it! Jay deserves better. Tammy! How'd you find me? I didn't believe that warehouse story for a second. I tracked your phone. Where's Jay? She had him in the car. I got him, he's safe. Hey. How you feeling? I'm okay. Well, Deidra's gonna be going away for a long time. Maybe now she can get the help she needs. I don't know, something just feels off. Well get some rest. I'll check on you shortly. Charles? Sorry, I broke a glass. It's all good. Okay, well hurry back. I'll be right up. Set it right there, right there. Appreciate it. Stop. We can't do this. What's wrong? We've been doing this a thousand times. This move is best for everyone. Yeah, but this time is different. Okay, what's worrying you? Things are just changing, really fast. I know, babe, but we need a fresh start, right? Jay will be in the same school district. He can keep the same therapist, right? You and me, we have more privacy, and we'll have enough space to build our own studio. Yeah, but will it be enough space? What are you talking about? I mean, we have more space than we'll ever need. Enough space for a nursery? A what? Oh my God, are you serious? Serious about what? What, what, what's she serious about? She's pregnant. Dad, keep up. We're having a baby. I hope it's a girl. Oh, I think it's gonna be a boy. I think I'm still in shock. Looks like there's gonna be another Steph Curry in the house. Oh yeah. Yes, another Steph Curry in the house. Oh my gosh!
