Subtitles by explosiveskull Life is moving faster and faster every moment. I'll bet your parents can attest to that. Especially today. I'd wager that when you were five years old, a single year was fantastically important. But once your 21st or 22nd year have sparked on and gone... Doesn't time feel unromantic? Isn't life starting to move just a bit faster? See, when you were five years old, one year was 20% of your life. But your 22nd year? 4.54%. Same number of days. Same trip around the local star. But it's going faster. We are all going faster. It's crazy. The truth is... You'll notice a rapid shift starting today. Why did you say that? Have you ever thought about this? This must be what our tuition is for. Four years of monotonous bullshit to finally earn audience to someone with a point. Daniel, I don't want this. Just cover your ears til it's over. No. Daniel? Us. Do you want to be the guy standing at the end of the finish line with two leather-bound book ends and a... I can't go to Los Angeles with you. I can't do anything with you. Why are you doing this here? I've spent a lot of time putting you into context vis-a-vis how we could possibly fit together long term. For starters, you've never actually written anything substantial, but you tell everyone you're a writer. - You serious? - Yes. It's like this giant metaphor that tells me everything I need to know about you. I can't stay with someone based on unfulfilled potential - But that's not... - Daniel. I have to do this before my family takes graduation photos. What? I can't have you in all the photos. If we break up after the photos, we can't use the photos for anything. We can't put them up at our house. Or send them out as Christmas cards. I mean, would that be fair to my mother? So take a breath. Remember this moment. For from now on, every moment will move faster than you could ever imagine. Thank you. Daniel, these have been the best years of my life. - Yeah. - But we're both ready for something new. We have to cut ties to each other. - I... - Los Angeles is your dream. But it's not mine. Is this about New York? Fine! Let's go to stupid New York! Jesus! Let's go to England! I don't care. We can go to fucking Zaire! - Zaire is the Congo. - What? Zaire hasn't existed since 1997. It's the Democratic Republic of the Congo. That's not the point. Okay, I haven't written anything substantial yet because, because I haven't had the right story to tell. But that's what LA will be for us. You know, we're gonna find something amazing there together! You can find something amazing... - ...without me. - But I don't want to. Graduates, please stand. Daniel, this is as sucky for me as it is for you. Please remember that. You know I'm not a cold person. Parents, friends, distinguished faculty... May I present to you, the Graduating Class of 2017! Good evening, what can I do for ya? Okay. 50, 70, 90... 103 coming in. Good luck. No more bets. Us. Hi. Who are you? Are you the landlord? - I'm... - Hold up. Jose! Yo! Um... Uh, the vacancy? Yeah, yeah, sure. - I'm Jose. - Uh, Daniel. Cool. In here. Come in. My mom's place. It's real nice. I take care of the property. It's a duplex? Yeah, like that. Luisa and her kids live on the other side of the wall. I have a room in the back with the yard. This is like an extra room. You can do whatever with it. Put a bed. Make it whatever you want. You have a job? Yeah, I'm a writer. Oh, cool. You can put your desk here with your pens and pencils and stuff. One time, we had a tenant that painted like the black walls lightning. You know what I mean? - Like a black light? - Yeah. Like a raver thing. Yeah, he was weird. You seem cool though. You know, you can paint the walls or whatever. If you want. Um... Here's the kitchen. You got a stove, refrigerator, we got new tiles. Bathroom's here. Got a real nice shower and a counter, and a thing to place the toothbrushes. Any questions? Uh, what part of town is this? We're Silver Lake adjacent. Oh. Silver Lake, that's cool, right? I lived here my whole life. And it's different here now. You know... It used to be the whole house. I grew up here, like, the whole big house. My mom built the wall. Like segregation. Just kidding. The cool thing is I have a room in back. You know, stay out of trouble and shit. So, uh... So you're a writer, huh? That's cool. Yeah, I, uh... I just moved here from New York. Oh. Shit. That's very cool. People talk all this mess about 15 second memory for fish, you know? I don't believe that. They love me because I feed them. They get all flippy when I walk in. Hey. If you move in, you can feed them instead. They'll love you for real. Like, unconditionally. Oh, that's Luisa. That's a sexy woman. I'd keep my hands off that shit. That's Connor and Hudson. They got white boy's names 'cause they got a white daddy. So how much for the place? Oh, okay. You have to stay for at least six months. It's $1,300 a month and 13 deposit, too. Okay, uh... Well... Here's $9,100. Um... I'm moving today and I don't pay you until January. Is that cool all upfront like that or... Oh, fuck yeah! - Thank you. - Yeah. - Hey, man. You need some help? - Out of the way! Oh, man. Can I get some water? It smells like smoked sausage. That's from the fire, man. I know you don't have a bed. I seen you laying on the couch and shit. You can't sleep on your couch your whole life! Fire? Yea, my homie's neighbor's house caught on fire. He said come clean up and help him out and take whatever. This mattress came from a house that was on fire? I thought you needed a bed. Yeah, it-it's great. It's great. Thank you. Cool. Cool. How's the book? What? Your book. Your writing. How's it going? Uh, it's, uh... It's fine. It's fine. Thank you. Hey, you got three tickets on your car. They do the street cleaning. You have to move the car every week. Okay. Okay. You need to get outside more. Carpe diem. See the day. Okay. Hey. Um... My homies and I, we have a fire in the back every Friday. We grill some meat. You should bring your guitar. Come hang out. - Everyone would like that. - I'll try. Thanks for the mattress. The smell will go away. Open the windows. The fish are gonna love it. Yo! Hold up! Yo, fellas. Listen up! This is Daniel, my new tenant. The writer. - That's Hector. - What's up, man? Dime... Lil' K... - Cesar. - Yo. Ricky, Wandy... Stevie... JonJon and Marz. I'm not gonna remember any of that. Sorry, I'm just not great with names. That's cool, boy. Have a seat. Hey, you like some asada? Have some asada. - Ricky, get him some asada. - Hold up. No meats will be given until the guest starts singin'. You owe us a song, compa. Payment for the meat, homie. - That's right. - Right now? - Yeah, homie. Sing. - Let's go. - All right. - All right. I see you, one man band. This James Taylor looking ass motherfucker right there. Adam Levine looking. Fuck. Is this Maroon 4? Maroon 5? What is it homie? I forgot. Karaoke night.

Yeah, man. Tell us. Who is it? Ah, just someone, um, far away. Well, she must've been a pretty special lady. - You know this goddess? - Yeah, she's my neighbor. Neighbor? You've been here for three months and you haven't even come and said hello. Damn, son. You don't bring no Jell-o mold or nothin'? - I mean, it's just next door. - Shut up, K. You're right. I should have. Sorry. Where's your boys? They're with their dad tonight. Mr. Jonathan. I'm surprised you ain't there right now, Lu. We know how much you love running back to that big gringo wang. We all know what you're running back to tonight. That's not true. That's not funny. Listen to me, papa. You need to get to a bar and revenge fuck this far away lady out your head. I... I don't really know my way around here. Go across the 101 and you'll be at the gates of gringo pussy heaven. Get down on some bougie Sunset Boulevard shit, you know? White girls with hot asses all over that joint! Don't ask for my approval. Can I get a, uh... Excuse me. Can I, uh... Do you have a... Excuse me. Trying to get a drink, flannels? Not having much luck. Play your cards right, we'll see if I can change your fortunes. Louie! What's up, honey? Uh, two martinis. Dirty as a Japanese rim job. And, uh... Uh, just a beer is fine. A barley drink for the lumberjack. Thank you. - Uh, I'm Daniel. - No names. - What? - No names. You're not your name alone, right? Good. Because I'm not what I am. Besides, it'll make the morning so much less awkward. Oh. I think you've got the wrong idea. I'm not... My world is in a plague of pretending tonight, my darling little nameless face! We must have you, shh. On the tab, Louie. John Adams! Now... Tell me your story, sad boy. What? You came here to get something off your chest but it's Friday night, and you're dripping a sadness ooze. No one wants to be depressed by your crap. Except me. I want to. So, tell me. Um... My girlfriend and I were supposed to move here together, but she dumped me. So I moved here anyway and a couple of gang bangers told me to go to the bar. What's your sad story? I don't do sad. No time for tears. On the contrary, I'm here tonight, also alone, because I'm too surrounded. I'm basically the Editor in Chief of Bring Me Your Daddy Issues Monthly. It's fucking draining. I wanted cisgender white male drama tonight. Thank you for filling the void. So you have too many friends? Don't get pouty and righteous. You're lucky I'm still sitting here. I generally don't trust anyone who doesn't insert dick into their body on a regular basis. Pretty graphic. Are you a Puritan? Hence the beard. Oh, my. There is something alive under those broken-hearted little puppy dogs. Aww. Why did she leave? You two were so perfect together. It's what everyone at the malt shop was saying when you pinned her. You don't actually care at all, do you? I care that you're gonna transmit your depression onto me any second. Sickness this bad must be contagious. - Sorry, yes. You're right. - Oh, hush, lover boy. You've come to Uncle at the right moment. I know your cure. You need to get fucked. Probably relatively violently. I mean, I'd do it myself, but I'm afraid that you'd cry all over me, and I find emotion disgusting. Everyone keeps saying that. But I've never really had a one-night stand. You're a true romantic, aren't you? A white knight. Boring! No one knows you, and you, sir, don't know them, AKA "No one gives a shit." 'Tis within ourselves that we are thus or thus. Your mission tonight is to thus your dick into something. But I don't know anyone here. Observe. Penelope! Look around! The world is your Fanny Bay oyster! Beautiful girls from sea to shining sea who will tell you in the sweetest voice possible, "I never do this kind of thing." But they do. Or at least they want to. We're all dirty sluts in our way. And every one of us wants a story for the memoirs. We get caught up in reputation. Which is nothing but an idle and most false imposition that you have no need to worry for. You're good-looking enough. Throw a bone. The dogs will come chomping. Thomas Jefferson! Give me your hand. I don't know if it's the olives talking, but I like you. I think you're just what we need. I thought we weren't doing names. Throughout the course of this conversation, I have fallen both in and out of love with the idea of you. We can be friends now. I'll help you get over this stupid twat. Okay. Yeah, I'd like that. Remember. You're too cute and too sad not to fuck tonight. Um, I never do this... But... Yo, Daniel! It's like 2:00 p.m. What? What? Can I come in? Did you get laid, bro? I think so. Where did she go? Where did she go? Shit, man. You need, like, a sheet for this. Yes, Jose. You're right. I fucked last night, someone... So, you know, yeah, good for me. You feel better? You know, I always feel unbelievable... - Do you need something? - What? Why are you here, Jose? Shit, man. I was just trying to be like a friend or whatever. Not offensively, bro, but you have a lot of sadness. You know, I was talking to Luisa and she was saying, like, she needs some help with the kids, picking them up from school and stuff... What? Like babysitting? Naw, nothing gay like that. She just needs some help, and I know you need some shit to do. But hey, I ain't trying to get in your business. Okay, I'll think about it. Cool. I'll tell Hector you fucked last night. He'll be real happy for you. Well, you know, Hector's approval means a lot to me. I'll tell him for sure. Okay! Hi, um... Is your mom here? Um, donde es... Connor? I'm Hudson. - Bueno. - We speak English. Okay. Daniel. Sorry, I was just getting dinner ready for the kids. Are you all right? - What do you mean? - Last night. How do I describe it? Um... You ever stood on a tarmac while a plane takes off? Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. The guys got me all riled up. I don't do things like that ever. Sorry. I, uh, I... Sorry. It's okay. Wait, um... Jose mentioned you might need some help with your kids? You wanna be my babysitter? I was hoping you wouldn't use that word but... Yeah. I mean, you don't have to pay me or anything, I just... I wanna help. What are your qualifications? You got a resume? Oh, well, I can get it to you. Um... I graduated BA in Lit Studies and I'm very punctual... - Um, no warrants out. - I'm just messing with you, Daniel. - Okay. - Jeez. You are sweet, huh? I actually could use the help, and um, It seems like you've got a good heart, so... Thank you. I, um... I'm trying. Okay, you've got the job. On one condition. Please, do not talk to my boys about women. I mean, you just feel like you're in a really dark place right now with the female race and I don't want them to go Bukowski just yet. You know, they still got some baby teeth. - Are you freaking out right now? - A little bit. Because your first job out of college is about to be babysitting or because I know who Bukowski is? Both. - Oh, can you pick them up from karate? - Yes, ma'am. That I can do. Two conditions, Daniel. Don't ever call me "ma'am" again, okay? - I'll see you later. - Sorry again. - No problem. - Okay. ♪ You can dress me up however you like ♪ You can take it up But you can't hide it ♪ I don't want it anymore you can have it ♪ Don't want Don't want it anymore ♪ Thank you, thank you so much! Stick around for Freddy's Dead! They're some hot shit and they're next! Daniel! Hey. Oh, so this is him? Daniel, this is my boy-whatever, Mack. He can't stop talking about you. I think you stole his heart. Oh, hush. Daniel, today was so fucking great. We spent every daylight hour capitalizing on my Internet fame. We're making videos of him playing a baby saying funny things. Babies are the only funny people left in the world. - It's gonna go viral. - Great Oh, my God. Look at you! You look like fucking Starfire and fucking Crackerjack. Prettiest thing I've seen all day. Ella? Daniel? - Oh, my God! - Oh, my God. Oh, my God. What is happening? Uh, Daniel. We grew up together. We're old friends. Chaos is come again! I knew it was the faith of fucking fate at work. Mack, didn't I say this kid had George Michael-level faith? - He did say that. - I did! I didn't even know you were here. This is crazy! Child, it ain't crazy. It's full blast fucking fate! Oh, my God. And then this harlot. This is Lilith. Uh, Daniel. No more small talk. My cup runneth over. My harvest's bounty is a cornucopia of friends new and old. Set me at Daniel's Puritan Thanksgiving table! Drinks! - All right. - Welcome to happier times, Daniel. Pierre, my darling! One, two, three, four, double for me. - Six Kamikaze shots. - You got it. Kamikaze shots, you cheeky bastard. Hush. Okay. Gather around, my beauties. Okay. Raise them. To fate. Andrew Jackson! Martin Van Buren! Again, Pierre! Again, my pretty! Holy fucking Lord. I am so happy right now. Are you happy, Daniel? I guess. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Definitely. - Yeah. - The third "yeah," I believed the third "yeah." Keep working on that. Yo! We're Freddy's Dead! Let's get this party jumping. Oh, my God! Hurry, Pierre! Gulp them up, ladies! William Henry Harrison. John Tyler! Let's go! Yo, Seth. Money! Put it on the tab, Pierre!

Unbelievable. I know. I thought you'd never make it out to LA. I'm a writer now. I love it here. Wow. That's amazing. I don't know about all that. I haven't really... No. I mean that you haven't changed at all. You know that if you're still craving a center, you came to the wrong city, right? - What? - Oh, come on, Daniel. I don't believe for one second that you love this place and the reality of it. Look, you got this idea in your head as a dreamy teenager in Portsmouth reading Raymond Chandler and a whole bunch of bullshit. - All right. - Now you think you're here, in the center. You always pinned yourself to some romantic idea. Oh, honey, no. It's not a bad thing. It's just not how things work out here. I mean, you've got this huge canvas to spread out in. Seth was right. This is fate working for you now. You don't have to be stuck at 16 anymore. Yeah. Shit. What I'm trying to say is, everybody has bad shit happen to them. And we're all just trying to get past it. Do something better. You know, when everything happened with my folks, I put my sister in a car, and we just drove. First person I met when I got out here was Seth. So, it's meant to be, right? Our pasts don't have to be ours alone. I have all these people in my life. But it's like my whole life finally has an ultimate goal now. Yeah. For sure. Me too. It's okay to be happy, you know. You're here now, too. Give me your phone. Come on. Go here tomorrow. It's best around 3:00. Go up and relax. Just give the old baggage a rest for a little bit. Uh, you know, I'm pretty busy. 3:00 p.m. It's magic. - Promise me. - Okay. Will you go out with me? Oh, you're so funny. I'm genuinely asking. I know you are. Daniel, this is my fiancee, Bonnie. - Hey. - What is up, man? We are about to go do some blow and you are 7,000% invited. Mmm. You ever look at someone and think like, "I bet I know how she smells." No. Okay, I'm asking you seriously. Do you think she's with him? What's the big deal with this chick? So she's pretty? There's a lot of pretty chickies. It's a waste of time fighting anger with madness. Well, you know, I was fighting anger with indifference, and that didn't work. So I figured I'd give madness a shot. You know, this chick in your phone, she's like... Like your manifestation of your infatuation of what could've been. Next chapter. Let the fantasy go. Like my man Lenny Bruce once said, "The 'what should be' never did exist, "'but people keep trying to live up to it. "'There is no 'what should be.' There is only what is." No one told you to say smart shit. Do you know how you know when you're over her? When you're okay with another dude fucking her in the ass. Ugh, God. - I'm not there yet. - Fine. You ain't there yet. But the obsession ain't worth your time. You got all that cash, man. If I had all that, you'd best believe I'd be getting out there to see the whole goddamn world. Not hanging out back here with some old guy like me. I'd be on a fire pit on each of the seven continents, go to every single country, find myself a Swahili girl to jimmy my stick for a night. Oh, man. And then a Swiss girl... You know, I don't know... I just had a Silver Lake girl jimmy my stick, and the fallout from that wasn't romantic at all. Man, that romance you talk ain't even real. You made this whole idea up that this girl in this picture is your perfect chickie. There's no such thing. Take the money and fly. Go see the whole damn world. You'll find what you need. My daughter, when she was 13, she was getting all into boys, you know... She was with these kids. These dudes were like... Like me when I was a little gangster, you know? This one kid Eduardo. She would be saying, "Eduardo is the coolest. He's cooler than you, Daddy." And I was like, "No, he's not. "I'll kill that kid." I mean, I have no idea what you're talking about, Jose. Just sharing. I thought we were having some sharing time. Thank you for the time. I think I 'm gonna go try to carpe some diem. Yup! That's what I wanna hear. Go get that head clear, you know? Nothing but cobwebs and tequila! Which one are you? What? Which one are you? Oh, uh... This one I guess. Unless there's a Silver Lake adjacent one somewhere. Which one are you? Silver Lake, no adjacent. Um... - I'm Daniel. - I'm Talya. Talya Gregory, Ella's sister? Oh, shit! I'm Daniel Willingham. I grew up in Portsmouth. I know. Do you remember me? Mmm-hmm. All the way up here, that's... That's kind of incredible, no? Well, did Ella tell you about this place? Yeah. Great. I guess not everything has a meaning, huh? I didn't know you were in LA. - Well, you don't know me. - No, I know, but... I remember you. Do you know Seth, too? Seth's my best friend. I think he's in love with you. Oh. Ah, well... Yeah, he seems like a good guy. He's the best. He wasn't lying about you either. What? This is not what I expected LA to be like. Well, Los Angeles is the only city in the world that people disdain without ever even visiting. I like to come up here all alone though. My own little special hideaway. It's my favorite place. Do you wanna see something? Where you going? Follow. Cool. This was here? Yeah. Amazing, huh? The train went right up the side of the mountain. It brought vacationers here in the age of Ragtime. But it burned down a long time ago. They're all dead fuddy-duddies now. This wasn't even that long ago. I mean, imagine the stories these people had. They were all right here. Like who? I don't know. Any of them. All of them. - Choose one. - What? You said imagine their stories. Choose one and imagine me their story. Okay. Um... Cornelius Quackenbush Bigelow. Having lost is great fortune in the Boston blizzard of 1886, he set out West to find greener pastures. A locomotive steam engine brought him to Los Angeles in June of 1888. Here, he found a partner in Thurston McHolinger. This man. Together, McHolinger And Bigelow started the greatest Umbrella Cartel the world has ever known! Tell me how they die. Legend has it McHolinger was trampled to death by one of the first cars in Los Angeles in 1908. Left to carry on the Umbrella Cartel legacy, Bigelow, well, he soon turned to the drink. His erratic temper and penchant for the boozier things sunk the company. Drowning in the sorrows of his lost fortune and dead partner, Bigelow soon took his own life in an epic rainstorm. His final words were "Tragedy shall never rain upon me!" He then opened his umbrella and shot himself through the heart. And as he lay dying, he clutched the umbrella above his head, never letting a single drop of rain touch his mortal body. The end. What? Shh. Nothing. What are you doing? I want this memory. Because soon we'll be in the past. Because of this picture will take every moment after this can be the past, too. But if this all ends and we're just chalked up to a memory or moment or whatever, shouldn't we just try to enjoy it while it's happening? What about those pictures you were just looking at? That was the real past. I didn't know there was a difference. There is. There are rules in chaos, you know? What? Maybe things that are more powerful than structure. You mean, like fate? What? - Hi. - Hey. Bye, Daniel. Hey, Lilith. How are you? God damn it, Lilith! Let him in. We're overjoyed, Daniel. Make yourself at home. The lady will be right out. Oh, great jacket, man. Thanks. This is the cutest thing ever, Danny. Well, give the baggage a rest, right? Fuck yeah! Daniel. An honorable young man asks for permission when it comes to the young and supple... There was no prior approval on this outing. That's something that will have to change for the future. Uh, I didn't know there was... If I let you take her out tonight, will you promise to be good? Honest, respectful. Yes. Yeah, of course. Oh. I believed all three of those. Hey. I love it. Rule number one in this home, Daniel, is what? - Uh, I don't know. - You will have her home by curfew. Curfew is 10:00 p.m. This is non-negotiable, Mr. Willingham. In order with God's wishes, she shall return home uninebriated! By penalty of death! Now. What dowry have you brought to present to her mother and I? Oh, shit. I'm sorry, man. Your face. Your fucking face. - You're pretty funny man. - Oh, no. I'm a very funny man. Better learn to laugh at the fucking jokes, Danny. Tempo, Mack. Tempo. Pace. - Hi. - Hi. - You look nice. - Thank you. Mack. In the room. - Shall we? - Mmm-hmm. Bye, Lilith. Well, it's Seth's house but... Everyone lives there basically. I don't know how nice it is. No privacy and all. Who lives there? Me and Ella and Bonnie... Seth... Lilith, Mack, most of the band... And then other people always just come and go. Cool. So it's like a big family. What? Do you think I'm like mysterious or something? Like when I'm being quiet. Do you think I'm thinking all these great things? I don't know. I... I think I'd like it if you told me what you were thinking. But maybe you wouldn't at all. Well, I think I'd like the chance to find out. Every moment after this is the future. It's weird you don't know that. What? At the hotel... You said that every moment after this can be the past now, too. But that's dumb. Lorca wrote that nostalgia is a disease. Did you know that? No. Every moment after this is the future, okay? Yeah, ideally. I think that we're the same in a lot of ways. Like I think I can be a writer, too. I think that I can find stories and imagine lives and all that stuff. You know, like, I wanna live every second of every human's life that was ever born. And then I would know just how everything feels. I mean, it would take a long time but... But it would be better than waiting for New Year's to feel like something's gonna change. Like, is an arbitrary calendar jump just gonna make everything change, like, snap? - Nah, it never seems to. - Right. But like if I can live to be 120 years old, then I could at least see everything, you know? But I can't. I know I can't do that. Why not? Because my body would shrivel and have arthritis. And probably cancer and dementia. What? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'll get better. I have to go. Thank you for tonight. Uh, wait! Hey! Hey. Talya... I just... I want you to know what I'm thinking, too. Which is that I think you're wonderful. And I haven't actually thought that about anyone in a good long while. I thought I did, but no. And you say things to me even in your silence, and it makes me think about something beyond myself. And I know I've said all this corny cheeseball shit tonight, current speech included, but I just... I gotta believe something good is even possible. Also, I wanna kiss you. And if you don't, that's cool. I just... I don't want it to be because you didn't know that I want to. So, sorry to do this but sort of... The whole thing is on you now. Let's go. Let's go! I got you one more time! I got this one more time! - All right. - I got him! - Try me again. - I'll try you again! Let's go. Oh, look. Dad. - Where's your mom? - Inside. Dad, I made a 100 goals! That's great. Lu! So that's your dad, huh? - Yeah. - He's a dick. You left your goal wide open. - Wait, what? - Time in! Goal! I wanna fall in love with a Canadian. That sounds romantic. Hmm. Fate, Daniel. Fate. How about Mack? - Don't you love him? - Oh, Mack is fleeting. Or should I say he's refundable. As are most, by the way. I can't commit. Well, maybe it's because you judge a book by its cover. Daniel. Small talk is mind-numbing. For dessert, we're going to discuss your deepest truths. What? I have a very succinct and specific reason for my line of questioning. Just follow along. Okay. What do I not know about you? It's a bit loaded. You know, I don't have any clue where I'd begin... First truth to pop into your head. Whatever it is. Don't think. Um... I won't sugarcoat it. Hope for you may be unrealistic at this point. But there is a certain salvation that can be found. Just follow what I'm saying. What do I not know about you? I never know if I'm saying the right thing. - Does that count? - No, tell me another. I don't know what to say. Say something as if your life depends on it. A semi-truck is veering head on into your lane and you have one second to live. Go! Give me something to care about! No, man. Trust me, you don't wanna know the shit that's going on in there. No, I do. The world has branded chaos as negative. It's not. It just needs to be cultivated. We can create a structure inside our chaos. Like the center I hear you crave. You understand that a few of us have the power to harness that center, Daniel? They called us "The lost ones." But what if we're the found? I really... I don't know what you want me to say, Seth. You do. You do. I'm feeling better since I met you. Because you're a better person now. I mean, all of you. The journey you've been on to this point has just been parameters stacked on parameters. You get born. Parameter! You suck on your mama's tit. Parameter! Your school, your work, your no play, your organized activities, all just parameters! And now suddenly, you have life. That's what we call this brand new chaos you're most recently experiencing, by the way. - Okay? - Yeah. Dig down. Tell me more. I... I have this total and completely crippling fear that I will never be able to write anything ever. Good. Why are you here? - 'Cause you texted me to meet you. - No. LA. Why did you come here now? I came to LA because I wanted to get away from the falseness of my past. To accept the truth of my present. Maybe a little less pretention, but I'll take it. Have you considered this crusade of truth has a faulty base? Truth itself has a faulty base. Don't get clever. That's not what life is about. Tell me more about this wild past of yours. I'd rather not. You know, right here, there's all these people... You do understand your past does not belong to you alone, right? Yes. There it is. Don't be selfish. Share. I've given you me. I've given you my door, my friends, my world. What have you given us? It's time to return the favor, Daniel. - What are you saying? - Don't read into it! Not everything has a meaning! Chaos is honest and it's granting you a moment right here, right now. Tell me what's cracking you! I don't wanna do this here! Oh, who gives a blow about these conventionals? Fuck them! Their wontons are more interesting than their thoughts. The soggy tuna is festering their brains! Don't fall back into being one of them! Break through the crowd and give me some of the real you! - I don't know what you want from me! - Tell me about them, Daniel. Who? Who told you about them? Ah. There's the rub. "Them" means something to you, and I don't even have a clue who the fuck they are. But you do, and that's what matters. It's all just fucking conjecture to me, but you're right on the edge of getting past your thing. This is a wall. Open up! Let it out! Smash through it! I can't live in the present because I'm fucking haunted by my past! - Good. Why? Say it. - Because I'm destructive! - Good. Yes. Why? - Because fucking bad things have happened to me! Bad things happen to everyone. What makes your bad so special? - You wouldn't understand! - Try me! My story is 20 years of shame, and rejection and violent hatred forced onto me every, every, every fucking second! And I defeated it. I won! I came out the other side like the return of the God damned King holding the ring I just stripped from the volcanic center of the fucking Earth! And now, I, King, am here in front of you, and I want nothing more than to understand. Don't you see? The whole world wants you, Daniel. Chaos is come again but we can ease it together. You can be a part of the remedy. I can save you if you just open up. Show me that you have something to give our world. I, uh... I need to know everything, Daniel. It's the only way I can help you. I'm sorry. I can't. Hey. - Hey, sorry I had to buy one. - Get back in. What? Get back in and drive. Okay. Wait. Daniel, I'm... I've never been with anyone before. It's okay. We don't... There's nothing we have to do. Will you come to Lilith's birthday tonight? Yeah. Of course. It's downtown at Shingyo at 9:30. Will you come? - Yeah, I just said... - I mean no matter what. Like if you don't hear from me or whatever today, still come. Okay? It's just... I want you there. Okay. Yeah. Of course. I'll be there. Okay. Hey, are you okay? Is there something... I love you. Who's that? Don't worry about her. - Hey, I'm Brody. - Don't talk to her. - Okay. Sorry. - Look at me. Hope for you may be unrealistic at this point, but there's a certain salvation that can be found. So follow what I'm saying. What do I not know about you? And I knocked him down on the floor. He's an old man. Did you really have to do that? Didn't you kick his butt? I mean, I did... - Mommy! - Mom! - Hi, guys. - Hey, Mom. Oh, bring it in. - How was karate? - It was amazing! I did 800 tomahawks! That's awesome. Me and master sensei did 900. - I'm not surprised. - Daniel drew me a Chewbacca picture! - And Han Solo! - This is great. We'll get it up on the fridge. - Yeah. - All right, go get ready for dinner. Okay. Come on. - And wash your hands! - I can't make that promise! You better make that a promise. Okay. Pretty sure tomahawk's not a real Karate move. Yeah, well, if either of them wants to get in the sport professionally, - I'll be sure to let them know. - Okay. Nice touch with the drawing. They really love you. Um... Are you okay? Yeah. I know. No, I just... - You know, with their dad thing... - Ah, I got it. - Yes, I am fine. - Okay. 'Cause you can tell me if you want. You can like wink three times or we could have a code word. What? Nothing. That was an adorable offer. You wanna stick around for dinner? I'm sure the boys would love it. I, uh... I can't.

Hey, take it easy. What are you doing on the street, Mack? There are rules to the chaos, Danny. Everyone keeps saying that but I don't know what that means. Because he's right. There are rule to chaos. But you don't get to make them. Mack, are you okay? You wish that his rules were true. But I can help you, Mack. I can help you. What do you need? - I have money. - Would you help me? Yes, what do you need? You can kill him? What? You can! You can kill him! Before they all go, Danny! That's fucking crazy. What are you talking about? I can get you a gun, okay? Not here, I don't have it on me but I can get you one, Danny. I don't have it but I can get you a gun, Danny. You need a gun! Please? Yo, Daniel! What's up, homie? Long time, no see! Yo, you dressed like a little pussy just for us? - Don't be so mean. - Here, have a beer. Whoa, whoa. I keep trying to do good things for people but they don't want it, okay? I'm trying to be in the moment, I'm trying to be good... But, but I can't make it work, okay? The gears aren't fucking connecting! I can't even get my words right. I can't even get sounds to make sense. Man, you don't wanna hear this shit right now, but fuck them females. This is your own doing. You're letting your mind get warped by your love obsession. What you try to give her now that she didn't want? A book. My favorite book. Yeah. Because I'm the first guy in the history of the world to do something stupid over a girl, right? Yo, you wanna borrow a shovel? What? How in the hell else you gonna get that sand outside your vagina? All right. Good. I was just playing. So sensitive. Daniel... I'm sorry. I don't get it. You told me to come and then you just... You didn't want me there. I guess I'm not one of you. It's not that. - I just saw Mack. - You are a part of this, Daniel. - He's all fucked up. - Everyone just needs to spend more time with you. But Seth doesn't want me there. I'll talk to Seth. You have to be here at New Years. - I don't understand why he doesn't... - Talya! I wanna see you, okay? Let's go somewhere now. Talya? Pace. I have to go. I love you. Sorry, I have to. Hey, it's Talya. Leave a message. Hey. I don't think you actually want me to stop. I don't know if you meant what you said. Listen, I'm still here, all right? If you need time before whatever this New Years thing is, it's okay but... I'm here. Meet me up in the mountains sometime. I know I don't say the right things, but I'm here. If there's anything you need, I'm here. We want what's best, right? T-bird. We want what's best. We're so, so close. Tempo. Play it again. Look, I don't think you actually want me to stop. Maybe you didn't mean what you said. Listen. I'm still here, all right? Oh, a man on the couch. Hi. - Sorry. - Don't be sorry. - Keep sleeping if you want. - They went to bed around 8:00. Huddy was crying a little. So I let him play video games. I hope that's okay. No. You should stay. So, how's that girl of yours? Any more books? No, not really. It's, uh, complicated. I always get the shit kick pile leftovers, you know? I'm bombarded by bad pick-up lines, disgusting breath and hands groping all up on my ass. I don't want that shit anymore, Daniel. No, of course not. I mean... Knowing you, you don't deserve that. Why is that every man I wish would show up on my doorstep is just always too noble to do it? I want a knight. Romance novel dream shit. Fucking pathetic, right? What am I? An eight year-old girl? No. No, you're... You're like a real woman. Um... I gotta go. I knew you'd come. Of course. It's like the Bat signal. The Mahipitipita Signal. You won't be able to come here anymore. I can't see you. That's all I can say, okay? I'm sorry. Hey. Hey! What is all this? I wish... I could just be mountain Talya, and you could be mountain Daniel, and we would just have our own little secret place and that would just be everything all the time. We can go wherever you wanna go. Anywhere in the world. I can't leave. Why? Because... I have too much that I'm committed to here. New Year's is this fresh start. The calendar flip isn't arbitrary, okay? - Yeah. - I have to be here. Daniel! I'm sorry. There are bigger things that you don't understand! I don't have a choice! You have a choice to be wherever you wanna be. What? Hey. I'm making you some breakfast. All right. I know you like to talk a lot, but I just need you to hold your thoughts okay? Okay. I am moving back home. But this is home. - No, this isn't where I'm me. - Is this about money? Or like a father figure thing? - Stop, Daniel. - No, really. 'Cause I have money. You know, and I can be a man I think... Like a real man. Just let me be straight with you about last night. I was confused about myself. Everyone handles their shit differently. Some people get angry, some people like to fuck. - And I'm not saying that any of it is right. - Last night was a rush. - I honestly didn't know I could feel like that. - Stop. What I'm trying to say is that last night messed me up a little. Because yeah, there is something here. And I woke up this morning, and I looked over at you, and I was thinking... I could get used to this. But it was fleeting. Because you're not a man, and you don't need to be one yet. And more importantly, I realized that my entire life, I believed that I needed a man to be whole. I left my home for a man. I moved to the city for a man. And that's my honest, messy truth. From God to me to you. Yeah. I needed to feel like someone was with me last night. And truth be told, you were the best person to make that mistake with but... No matter how good it feels, I would be doing it for all of the wrong reasons. And I don't want you wondering why or if... Because you have had enough of that game. And you do deserve to know why people do the things that they do. Thank you. It will suck without you guys. You've got Jose and the boys. Those guys think I'm a joke. Come on. They only razz you because they like you. They must think you're worth something or else you wouldn't be able to get shit off of them. They've been through too much to be fake with anyone. Too much what? The same shit that Jose's been through. You notice I'm not following, right? The house, Friday night group, the whole thing. You really don't know? Jose's mom left him this house after his daughter was killed. What? - Jose's daughter's dead? - Yeah. Same with all those guys. They've all lost a kid. And now they're there for each other. They wouldn't just let anyone sit around that fire with them, Daniel. Why didn't you tell me about Friday nights? Oh, come on. You're this amazing guy and you were never gonna let on? Just act like this nobody caretaker when you're actually saving the fucking neighborhood? - I don't do it for a trophy. - I know you're not. But bad shit has happened to me too, Jose. Okay? - You couldn't let me in on it? - When have I closed my door to you? It's not about that. I thought this was a two-way thing but it's not, really, is it? You know, I vent to you... - And you don't share with me your story, your life... - This shit ain't about me. It ain't about any of them females either. Stop blaming your little bitch problems on the world circling around you. You wanna deal with the truth? Okay! Okay, homeboy. Mirror time. Judge yourself. - Take a seat. - Okay. Okay, if I was one of you guys, what would you tell me? All I can say is you're the only one who knows where your sadness lives. You tell me. Can I imagine you a story then? Okay. There once was a very slender man. Couldn't improve his God-given stature to save his life. And the older he grew, this thing that he couldn't control became a source of constant disappointment for him. He gave his wife and son a love so deep, that it could just engulf the world. You know, he loved with every fiber of his being. It wasn't enough. This was a man born for sadness. When he caught his wife in the arms of a bigger man, well... Something just went haywire... ...in a snap. So he went to his 16 year-old son, and he said very calmly, like he had been thinking of the right words to leave him with for years, "Love is fake. "It's a front." He then hit the road and never turned back. And his wife was left bathing in this guilt that slowly destroyed her. She spent days and nights looking at her son... She would try to muster some words that would save the concept of love for him. But... The well was empty. No one could know for sure but, she was probably the one who veered into the oncoming lane when the truck hit her head on. Love made that boy an orphan. And he's spent every moment since trying to convince himself that it can be real. I don't have any love left in me. There's a stone of hate buried in my gut. I know this hate. My hate was all connected to my past, too. I had to rediscover the moments where things got fucked. You ask me about my daughter. I acknowledge it. I respect it. Sometimes all you need is to admit that the past actually happened. That's how you live with it. Because that past is never-changing. Those moments are permanent. That shit happened. But you can always start again. Change how you deal with your truth. If you get rid of that stone in your gut, you'll find all the love you'll ever need. Hello, guys. Yo. Daniel, we're moving! I know. I'm gonna miss you guys! - I'm gonna miss you, too, man. - Can I come? I'm sure we'll make room for you. Probably on the couch. I mean, we can ask them to pull it out. Okay, boys. Say bye to Daniel and get in the van. Bring it in. Bye. Will you guys send me drawings? - Yeah! - All right. Later. - All right, bye. - Bye. Oh, look, there's trouble. There's trouble. Bye, Jose. You know, it would be pretty romantic if I could tell you that I can grow up for you like right this second. That I could like protect you and the boys... But I can't. I'm not a grown up at all. Me neither. Man... You and me, in another life? We could do wonders. Damn the whole space and time thing. Yeah, something like that. - Bye, Daniel. - Bye. Hey. Zachary Taylor. What an inappropriate surprise. I have tried so desperately to make clear to you that you are not welcome here anymore. I need to talk to you alone. Pace. Pace. Your position has been filled. Jesus, Seth. I never do this. Let's not cry over spilt milk. You got a nice fuck out of Cindy here. She's not the only one. You know, it would be honest if you didn't manipulate the chaos of the entire universe at every moment. We could have revealed quite a bit of truth together, you and I. You were so close. Did it ever occur to you that I just didn't wanna go there with you, and that Talya doesn't either? Bullshit! We were a couple heartfelt sessions away from you being right here with us, but you could never uncloud your vision. The found ones see with clear eyes. She has those eyes and she chose me. No. No, this is not a choice, Seth. But you said we all had a choice. No, you gather information from your brainwashed sources, and then claim to be the savior. This magic purveyor of truth. No! Ella knew me and she saw my post. She knew I was in LA. What? She told you I was lost? And that you should be the one to find me? Ah, Jesus, man. That's not fate. It's not chaotic truth. It's manipulation! Nothing here is organic. You kill anything that's real. I saw what you made Mack. - I saw him. - Oh, let him do his spite! I destroyed nature in its making, and I desire the repercussions. - You're on the wrong side of good. - That's right. If only you could have come over here with us... - But it's too late. - You know what? You have taught me, Seth. I used to think that people were either good people or bad people. But now I know now life really isn't that black and white, is it? I believe you took someone who was a good person and you scrambled her brain. You took someone who was good and kind and had beautiful thoughts of her own, and you killed her fucking soul, Seth. You slaughter people. And I won't have you do it to me. I understand a fury in your words, but not the words, Daniel. I don't want any of your "Chaos is come again" bullshit. Oh, miracle to the heavens. He said the magic words. Chaos is come again, he says! The preacher man doth proclaimed by the wise prophet! Do you think it's just that simple? Do you think you say some magic words, and poof! Well, please. Since you understand all, oh bounteous writer, give us something! I want a poem. Maybe a sentence. Fine. Just a word. No, you can't. Isn't there something, anything you have inside you that the world might give a shit about? Anything? Have you given us anything? Have you given us one fucking thing at all that's worth my gifted ear or my Godly eye? I'm waiting! Give me something, you feckless fuck! The only choice we all have is to find a way to use our own free will. I've never done that before. But I'm giving my stone over to you, Seth. It's yours to keep. Goodbye. In 1887, a fledgling railroad official named Herman Silver arrived in the Los Angeles basin. He found a home in the tiny paradise then known as Edendale just a few miles from the base of the San Gabriel Mountains. In 1906, he staked the spot where The Silver Lake Reservoir would hold the water to give the region life. Thanks to this outsider, Silver Lake became a cornerstone community in the fastest growing city in the world. Thank you. Oh. Don't forget to feed those fish, huh? Those little fuckers love me now. I told you. Where you heading? - No idea. - Hmm. Maybe, uh... Maybe to find some of those other bonfires. Mmm. Hey. Happy New Year. Happy New Year, Jose. Daniel, wait! Daniel! Daniel! And for over one hundred years, people from all around the world have come here. They've loved and lost, triumphed and perished, married and had children... They've made and sullied fortunes. The human beings that have lived and died in this tiny pocket at the center hardly know Mr. Silver's ghost is even present. Because he doesn't haunt with requirements to fulfill his dream that once was. Rather, he observes from afar, bathing in the reality of life that his legacy has left behind. He watches from that distant place and admires even the smallest, softest kind of bravery. We are just like him. And someday, we too will be the stuff of ghosts, and the shadows they leave behind. But for today, we live. Today, it's our turn to take the reins of reality. Today, we can make the choice that until now left us so paralyzed with fear. Today, we finally decide... ...to turn every moment after this into the future. Subtitles by explosiveskull
