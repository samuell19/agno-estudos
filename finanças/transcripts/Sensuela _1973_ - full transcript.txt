Are you in trouble? l just got fired Fired. But that was... Well, it wasn't all that nice a job Dirty dishes wouldn't suit me at all Thank you, come again My life is quite nice, - although the business is going worse and worse But in this profession there's not much one can do With your face and figure you could charge a lot Do be quiet, Greta. l want to do it my own way Yes, yes, but don't let too much time pass One has to use one's body as long as it attracts men And think, that figure of yours surely attracts them They are like hungry wolves They all want that one thing Men are shit, egoists, pigs, that's right They also have money It's only a question of taking it from them. It's a revenge Although at times one feels like scratching their eyes out Bloody shits they are, l know them well! Phoo! Laila had little chance without qualifications,' - to choose her job. Luckily her expectations - were not that great, either - and this meant that Laila didn't become bitter Look at that Don't rush, Ilkka. Don't be so stingy with your goods Why don't you give some Ty, but not without my permission That's right, girl, don't give up! Well, what, fired again? No. l quit Nice looking girl. Ask her to come here with us l don't think she'll come yet. - Ty, anyway Laila, come here. It's great here.

Electricity bill. Why doesn't you father ever answer your letters? l ran away from home. He's never forgiven me Why did you leave? There was a man. l loved him and thought that he loved me But he didn't... Let's don't talk about that Oh, men are shits every one of them They talk of love, but mean sex And while we want love they want our bottoms Oh, they are sweet at first, then they turn their backs and sleep Cunt, that's everything for them. That's about all they care for Does your father know you left the other man? l don't dare tell him l still write to him that we are happy - and that we'll get married as soon as we find a suitable flat l don't want to lie, but... One lie leads to further lies. That's what happened to me Soon l was with a pimp, Joni, and ended up in his stable l had no idea what kind of a gentleman he was Good, good! You seem to be in love? Yes, it's true. Life is worth living after all Darling? It doesn't matter. What does it mean here? Love without money, it doesn't work Do you think that love fills your belly?

Shame on you! Second floor. Thanks a lot Come with me, and bloody fast. - What's the matter? Your father wanted to meet Hans. l didn't know Hans' address - and he went to he police to get it. - Why?

Pretty as ever. Beautiful clothes suit you Oh, not now, Hans. You must help me Of course, how much do you need? - It's not about money Father is here, and he wants to kill you and me What makes the old man so bloodthirsty?

And then you just... laugh l understand, of course you'd be angry, if it were true But it is Laila Yes, but only Laila's face, not Laila's body I'm not showing my future wife's charms to the world Now l don't understand, explain All right. First l select from my model photos one of Laila, - where her face looks best suited for the purpose - and then l take a photo of a professional model - with a suitable body Then l cut a part of Laila's picture, - showing almost nothing but her head Then it's carefully set in the right place - on the photo showing the nude model After some re-touching the picture looks quite genuine This is a photo montage and part of my profession l must have been quite stupid, - but I've become old - and Laila is my only one Is Laila here? - No Really? The guard said that a woman collected her from work We were supposed to meet. She didn't show. Where's she? l don't know l think that you know. - l am not her guardian But you know.

Aslak wants a wedding We'll have the wedding for him. - Be serious It's impossible. l don't want you any more Good, l don't want you either, at least not for my real wife What do you mean then? l got the idea last night. We'll have a mock wedding for Aslak, - otherwise we won't get rid of him Then he'll go back to Lapland We'll wait a little, then you can write that we're divorced You can blame something. We have time to think of it later Everyone has to be quite serious It's a serious thing for the old Lapp Who's the priest? - Erkki, of course In your places, everyone. Now it starts Straighten up, children, just to to please an old officer. Music We are gathered here to unite two young... Is Laila at home? No. She wasn't at work today either, and she's not here.
