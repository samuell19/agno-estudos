PROVING GROUND The closest island is 5km away No shipyards, no airlines. A God-forsaken place We'll finish it tonight. The Committee members are coming tomorrow. Good luck The Committee members are coming tomorrow How interesting! So this thing can read our thoughts? Yes, it reacts to someone wanting to destroy it The so-called 'hatred impulse' When an artilleryman is aiming his gun... ...a special block in the tank... ...receives all the aiming data... ...while it's stored in the artilleryman's head. Once he takes action... ...the tank catches the impulse and changes location to avoid being hit The machine is catching biological currents, i.e. ... ...the enemy's thoughts and intentions So the enemy, against his will... ...will regulate the tank's behaviour Excellent. But so far this is only defence. How does it attack? I have to switch on another block Go on It's hot! On my oath, colonel, you're dreaming of a cold beer! I wouldn't say no Is it stuck? Oh, no, it's OK It needs a signal, an impulse of fear The enemy, afraid of being destroyed... ...reveals information about its weak points to the machine... ...then the tank begins the attack OK, let's have lunch. We'll carry on later The test seems to be going well, yes? If we had a few hundred such machines, we'd still have our colonies Most importantly, it's immune to surprise attacks. Do you remember Africa? How many of our tanks did the blacks burn? Why can't we make a plane on the same principle? Not just a plane... Rockets... all kinds of weapons. Are you all right, professor? Wake up! Why didn't you invent your machine earlier? We would've stayed in our colonies forever. My son was in the colonies with you He was even given a medal Congratulations! Posthumously My condolences Thank you This is war. Losses are inevitable Yes, this is war You like battles? You like your new weapon? Wonderful Try it on yourselves, not on others I told you, this tank reacts to impulses of fear Try not to think of danger. The machine can read your thoughts I'm not afraid of anything. I have no one left on this earth Damn, it's aimed at us! The firing's stopped. They must all be dead And I'm in the dead zone Horrendous machine! How did that idiot invent it? What if it uses its caterpillars? Now it'll start rolling Nah, it won't reach me. Too deep If only I had a grenade... ...but I haven't If I could climb on it! I'm an idiot! I must not think Now it will move aside and fire I must stay in the dead zone I mustn't leave the dead zone Damn it! It can increase speed Run! Tell them... that my life... ...is in danger Tell whom? They're all dead Well, do something! Here What's this? A medal. The one you gave my son, posthumously I can't run any more. That's it! Let it kill me! What's this? What's the matter?! Ah, I'm not afraid! I don't care You can kill me I'm not going to hide. Go on, fire! You can smash me with your caterpillars! Not the caterpillars! You see? I took revenge for you Don't be scared! You mustn't be scared! I'll switch it off It won't do us any harm, don't be scared I'll turn it off, and it won't do us any harm What're you doing? Stop! You can't do that to me It's me! I created you I didn't sleep because of you I devoted my life to you I wanted revenge, that was all What's it planning? What if it decides to fire? screenwriter Sergey Gansovskiy director Anatoliy Petrov art director Galina Barinova camera Mihail Druyan sound Vladimir Kutuzov montage L.
