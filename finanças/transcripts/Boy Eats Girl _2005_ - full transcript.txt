What are you doing here? Nothing, Father. Well, this crypt is the deconsecrated resting place of the missionaries who have strayed from the path. To disturb them is to rouse their blackened hearts. I didn't mean any harm. Now leave! And don't come back. Aah! ♪ Hanging around ♪ The streets of your town ♪ ♪ I was waiting for you there ♪ ♪ I'd run aground ♪ Was on the way out ♪ Just kept thinking about your hair ♪ ♪ Wait alone ♪ Head is gone ♪ Where are you running to... ♪ See you tomorrow, children. Bye, Jessica. See ya, Nathan. See ya, Jess. The time to move is today, Nathan. That's what he said. That's what he said, wasn't it? You'd ask her today and end her suffering. And ours. Then go after her, you idiot. I just find it hard to ask the question. Just let me think. No. Don't think. When Adam asked Jenny out and she said no, the whole thing got really messy, And I don't want that for me and Jess. Now, just being friends is better than the alternative. The alternative is shagging her. That's only if she says yes. To me, she won't say yes? Horrible truth time, Nathan. Jessica has, um... What are they called? Breasts. No. Standards. We're lucky she's our friend. Any more than that is pushing it. Thanks. We're so bored of the whole thing. Just ask her. She'll say no. It'll be a short, stabbing pain, and things will get back to normal. I would have broken it to you more gently. Nathan. Boys. Hello, Mr. Frears. I believe tomorrow is a school day. Shouldn't you be studying for exams, preparing for a future career? That is, of course, assuming that any of you has a future. Rest assured, gentlemen, I shall be speaking to Jessica about these wasted afternoons. ♪ This one's for you Chick. ♪ This one's for me ♪ This one's for you ♪ I got a nervous feeling Hey, what's an after-the-end-of-term disco? No. Come on. It'll be a laugh if we have a few drinks before we go in. Did you see that? Cheryl just smiled at Nathan. She wants him.Shut up. How unfair is that? Very unfair. What does our friend do? He pines over a girl he can't have. Why don't you just go out with Cheryl? Because I don't fancy Cheryl. That doesn't matter. And she has a boyfriend that'll beat him to a pulp. Hey, Cheryl. Now she's just standing there in a pair of high heels and nothing else. Naked. Nude. And the bar man can't resist asking her "What's this all about?" She looks him dead in the eyes and she says-- Sent. What? What does she say? She says, "Thank you very much," and she lives happily ever after. The end. Huh? You just texted Jessica to meet you at the shack at 7 tonight, because you have something really important to tell her. Well done, Nathan.Finally. Shit. Okay, people, before we go, who's got a topic for discussion? Come on. What issues are burning inside you? What do you want to express, to debate, to share? For example, Samson, who are you? Irish. Irish. Okay. So you identify yourself by your nationality. Now, what does being Irish mean to you? Anyone else? Yes. Brendon. Myths and legends, scholars, and writers. Joyce, Beckett, Yeats.Good. What a brain. Who reads those guys anymore? Yes. Thank you for that contribution, Cheryl. Mr. Diggs... how does being Irish make you feel? Suicidal. Right. Does anyone got anything sensible to say? Car fumes are good. Hang yourself. If your neck doesn't break, think how clear everything must be. Right, Kenneth, that's enough. Okay, people, for your homework-- Who have you got your eye on now, Cheryl? As soon as it becomes your business, I'll let you know. I didn't see you in my biology class earlier. Was anything wrong? Do you know what, Mrs. Brumble? You remind me of my granny. Ah! Oh, that's lovely, Cheryl. I can't fucking stand her, either. Nathan, hi. Hi, yourself. We've hardly spoken since the school year started. Did we ever speak before that? Every other guy in the school trails after my shadow. You hardly notice me. I notice you, though. Do you? Has Samson been giving you a hard time? I could give you a hard time if you like. Cheryl, listen, we should talk again soon because it's good, but at the moment there's this girl I like-- That's so sweet. Are you trying to make me jealous? Kenneth, are you going to the end-of-term disco? What? It's just I've got this great dress that I bought for New Year's Eve, but I didn't get a chance to wear it 'cause I was sick with bulimia. I'm going with Laura. Oh. All right. Ah-choo! See you later. Hey! Are those my sister's? Come on, Charlotte. She's like 14 or something. Yeah. Sorry. You know, I would have asked Jessica out in my own time. No, you wouldn't. You'd have put it off like you always do. Do you know your problem, Nathan? You over-examine, you over-analyze, and you over-think.Exactly. You restrict yourself to one option. That's why we have so much success with the ladies. Success with the what? Catch it! Whoa! Hey, McGuire! Samson, hi. That was a great tackle. Why don't you play more sports, McGuire? Does it have anything to do with the fact that you're a raging queer? Maybe. Have you been talking to my girlfriend again? If I don't hurt you now, I'm never gonna be at it. Do you see my dilemma? Next time we have words, McGuire, you're a dead man. We were just about to step in there. I was calculating his weak spots. Ah, he's just a bully. I still have my dignity. Yeah, but unfortunately, they have your trousers.

I'm just going to meet him for 10 minutes. No, you're not. Now go back up to your room this minute. And do not give me that look. Your mother would not have allowed such behavior, either... if that's what you were thinking. You know the way we've been friends for ages. But what I really want is to be much more than that.

You don't care, which is why I think we'd be good together. I'm flattered by the proposal, but it would never work. Why not? For one thing, I can't stand you. Is there someone else?

Well, my throat's very dry. Here. Have some more water. Mum, I've got to go. So how did last night go, Nathan? Ah, it was a disaster. What happened? Jessica didn't show up. Not for me, anyway. I went home. Got so drunk on whiskey, I blacked out. The whiskey was meant for before the disco. It was an emergency, Diggs. What's wrong now? Oh, you're not going to puke, are you? No. I'm just hungry, that's all. Were you just flirting with Cheryl? I looked at her. Is there a law against that? For me, there is. Listen, I'll catch you later, okay? What's he like? Who? Nathan. What's he like in bed? How should I know? Well, you're never gonna keep him that way. We're just friends, okay? Well, then you won't mind if I take him for a little test drive at the disco tonight. Samson not enough for you? Samson's a sweetheart, but he doesn't own me. I do what I like, when I like, and who I like. So if your "friend" is available, then tonight might be his lucky night, hmm? I can smell trouble, woman. Can I help you, Father? A book of pagan trickery has gone missing from my crypt. Missionaries in distant places were brought back from the dead by the voodoo rituals in that book. I'm sorry, but I don't see what this has to do with me. The book was damaged. And after that, those who were resurrected had the desire to eat the living flesh of others. If you have that book, return it now before you meddle with its secrets and unleash a darkness upon this place. Oh, my God. Oh, shit. Cheryl acts like she's in charge, but every night, she calls me, begging for phone sex. Ha ha! The dirty bitch. Hey! It's my girlfriend you're talking about. Oh, right. Sorry. Who are you taking to the disco, Kenneth? I'm going with Laura, but that doesn't mean I'm leaving with her. Tell me more about Jessica. Jessica? Oh, yeah. Talk about your dirty bitches. After I picked her up in the car, we went back to her place. Turned out that her father was away. She said she wanted to play strip poker, and I swear to God, she started losing on purpose. Oh, baby! Go on. She got down to her bra and knickers, and then she started making extra bets. She'd do this, and then she'd let me do that. Hi, Nathan. Attention, please. Your heart beats, on average, 70 times a minute. To take the pulse of the person next to you, you press your index finger and your middle finger to their wrist. Get off me! Try it now. Huh? You all look so lovely holding hands. Nathan, I want to talk to you about last night. I don't want to know. Look, you know we've been friends for ages. Who cares? "But what I really want is--" Those notes aren't for you. Not anymore. I used to think I loved you, but now I know who you really are. What? You're just like all the others. You're just another slut. How are you feeling, by the way? Nauseous? Headaches, maybe? Voices? What? Nothing. No, I'm just really hungry, that's all. Nathan, you may have noticed that your body's going through some changes. Mum, this stuff has all gone off. There's nothing to be afraid of. You probably have new urges that you haven't experienced before.

Why would I want that? Let me out, Diggs! You little queer! Now... do you want to dance? No. Shite. Who's there? Whatever gaylord is hiding out there better come out now before I thump you. I swear to God, I'll beat the crap out of you! Did you see her face when I said that? Uhh! How was the disco? Terrible. What happened? Nothing. Tell me. I can't. Nathan, nothing's that bad. Thisis. What is it, then? I just want to go to my room. I'll keep the music down. You have your whole lives ahead of you. You can do wonderful things. So many possibilities. I know, Craig. Then fight the system, okay? Never be intimidated by authority figures. You shouldn't be intimidated by me, for example. Don't worry. We're not. Good night. Get a room, you two. Hey, Samson. I could dance like this all night, man, but I've got to get back to my pad. Is something wrong? Need to talk about it? My teacher's hat comes off, But my listening hat is always on. What's on your mind, son? Spit it out. Fuck me. Please, please! Open the door! Uhh! Hello. Leave me alone. No, Nathan. I want an explanation. I can't explain. What have I done to deserve being called a slut? Please, go away. Well, what was tonight all about? Trying to make me jealous? I'm not safe. What did you say? Do you trust me? Yes, I trust you... I think. Then stay away from me. What do you mean? There's something wrong with me, and it's getting worse. Jesus, Nathan, you're starting to frighten me. I wanted to ask you out... but now it's too late. I'm in trouble, Jess. I'm sorry. You have to keep away from me. Nathan, come on. Just talk to me. "History. Priests. Reanimation." "Soulless body." There's something I need to tell you, Nathan. I didn't see the warning signs. That you were suicidal. I didn't know What? But I brought you back to life. What the fuck are you talking about? I found this book in the crypt at the church. I shouldn't have taken it, I know. I used the book to perform a ritual. I missed a vital element. The ritual didn't work. I made some mistake. That's why you're feeling like this. How do you know what I am feeling like? There's no pain. Your heart doesn't beat, and your blood doesn't flow. You want to eat human flesh. Is it infectious? Is it? Oh, fuck. Samson. Listen. I've killed a girl. Well, not me exactly, but I'm the one who's responsible. School holidays, huh? I bit a guy called Samson, and now he's infected. He's eating people. You gotta find him and lock us both up before I do it, too. Nice try. Would you look at me, for God's sake? Geez, that's very good, very lifelike. I'm not taking the piss. Hey. Now, you listen to me, son. Any more of your lip, and I'll have to arrest you. Yeah. Arrest me, you useless fucker. That's it! Get the hell out of here! All right! I'll find Samson myself, then! Doesn't look like Nathan's gonna show up. It's my turn to pick, then. No. You take too long. What, like it's an easy choice. You always do this every time we get a bloody film. The wrong decision can spoil a whole weekend. Diggs, it's popcorn or crisps. Just decide, will you? Lose the pops. Hi! Hmm, hmm... hmm. Oh, my God. Where's anyone below the age of oldness? We're in hell. I'm getting arthritis just breathing the same air as these people. Charlotte said she'd be a bit late. Maybe we should phone her. Afternoon, ladies. Oh, great. Hell gets worse. I must say you're both looking extremely elegant with all that skin showing. We didn't have that in my day. What? Skin? And you all walk around acting so innocent. You know, when I was your age, I was considered quite a catch. Really? The least you can do is buy us a drink. Where are my manners? What would you like? My friend will have a double brandy with ice, and I'll have a triple vodka with a splash of Red Bull. Coming up. Ew. Aah! Ma, what are you doing? I'm sorry, Nathan! I'm gonna try and get help! Hmm? Hello? Video boy. Service. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, that's it. Yeah. That's it. Come on, Charlotte. Yeah. Why'd you stop? I don't-- I'm not sure I like that. Did I come? Aah! It's Brendon, Father. Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It's been two weeks since my last confession. I was at the end-of-term disco, and I hid in the girls' toilets, and I heard them saying things, Father. Disgusting things. Father? Aah! I don't think he followed us. That's because he's too busy eating someone else. I think we should make a run for it back to the car. I'd feel a lot safer if we just stayed here, for the rest of the day, maybe. What are you talking about? We have to go to the police and report him. Why can't we let somebody else do that? We can't be doing everything all the time. It's always something to do with the family background. What is? The thing that causes a person to kill. It's all in their upbringing.What? Like his father's a butcher or something? No, Diggs. I'm talking about a psychological defect. Oh, right. Help me! Aah! Is he gone yet? That was Paul the Deejay. He was totally fucked up. Have you got a nosebleed, Diggs? No. Aah! Aah! Aah! Help me! Someone's attacking my boyfriend! Hello? Is there anyone here? Please! Aah! There's Joanie Murray. Shit. Somebody ate her arm. I used to fancy her. Oh, no. What is it? They're cutting across towards Jessica's. What do we do? Get Nathan and we'll go up to get her. Safety in numbers. I'll phone Jessica and warn her. Hello? Jess, you have to listen to me. There are some people heading over to your place. I told you, Diggs. No parties. They don't want to party, Jess. They want to hurt you. Lock the door and stay inside till we get there, okay? What's going on? Just find somewhere to hide and don't talk to anyone. Nathan! Nathan! Over here! I'm in the garage! What are you doing in there? Stop screwing around, will you? Jessica's in trouble! I got locked in! Open the bolt! Uhh! Oh, fuck. You are one of them. Nathan, it's us, man. We're your friends. We don't want to hurt you. Stop it, will you? What's wrong with Jessica? She's in danger. Most of our class, they look-- they look like you. Shit. They're attacking people. You know Miss Morris? Not anymore you don't, because she's been eaten. Get in the car. We're going to Jessica's. Quickly! Are you all right back there? I'm so fucking hungry. I'm trying to hold it off. Have you eaten anyone yet? No. But it's hard not to. Do you have any special powers, Nathan? I'm stronger. I'm faster. I don't feel pain. Can you fly? No, Diggs, I can't fucking fly. Pity. What's it like being dead, Nathan? It's empty. Numb. There's no blood circulating. None? Not even... down there? No. Oh, shit. Oh, shit! What'll we do? Ram them! It's Craig! Ew! Aah! Oh! He was one of them, though, wasn't he? He's still underneath us! Roll over a speed bump or something! Squish the bastard! The brakes have gone! Get into a lower gear! Oh, fuck! Turn off the engine! Aah! Come on, lads! Nathan, wait for us! Move it! Aah! Aah! Uh... Hello? I'm sorry, Father. I did take the missionary's book, but only for my son's sake. Aah! Aah! Dear God. What's happened to me? That's it. It's the snake. Will you stop this? We're in a graveyard. Yes, I know. Graveyards scare me. Just shut up and deal with it! Are they coming? I don't know. I can't see. There's Shane. Shane! Will you just-- Get down, you silly bitch! Well... Hi, Charlotte. This isn't going to hurt, is it? Uhh! Run! Aah! Aah! Uhh! Ohh! Aah! Jess, it's me. You're like Samson and the others. No. No, I'm not. Not yet. You need to tell me what's going on. Mrs. Brumble, help! Fuck you, you little bitch! You miserable old cow! Oh! Oh, oh, oh! Nathan? Jessica? Cheryl? Ooh! Get in the fucking house! Hang on! What am I supposed to have done that was so dreadful? I just thought you were better than that. Better than what? Better than Kenneth. I didn't know you'd be fooled by his bullshit. He doesn't deserve you, Jess. I couldn't actually feel that. Do you honestly think that I was with Kenneth? I saw you with him in his car. Oh, I don't know what you think you saw, but I'd never, ever be with a sleazy little shit like him. Do you think they've gone? I don't know. Why don't you stick your head out and see? We've got to get out of here. Are you crazy? They're out there, we're in here. I don't see the problem. The problem is, if they open this door, we have nowhere to run. Why are they going to open this door? They're flesh-eating zombies, not cleaning ladies. I agree with him. My name's Diggs, by the way. Whatever. Listen, why don't we stay here till dawn? Doesn't sunlight kill them? That's vampires. There's vampires, too? Will you shut up? Shh! Or I'll eat you myself. I've heard that one before. Shh! Oh, fuck it! Thank God, it's Nathan. Uhh! Jesus! That was violent! Go! Go! Get away! Piss off! Get away! Get off! Charlotte. Remember that giant teddy bear you got on Valentine's Day? The one you thought Danny Herbert gave you, which is why you had sex with him that time? It was from me! I've always liked you. I just wanted you to know that! Oh! Get in the barn! Come on! Follow me! They're right behind you! Get going! Aah! Aah! Jesus, Jessica, I think you did it! You wiped them all out. Pretty good for a virgin. Are you all right? I'm fine. Did they bite you? No. They didn't touch me. This is very loving and all, but we want to know what happens if Nathan goes out of control like the others. Aah! Go into the loft! Aah! Go on! They're on us! Keep going, keep going! Quickly, Nathan! Ready, Diggs? Do something, Diggs! I'm trying! Aah! Oh! Put a hole in the diesel tank! Yeah! Let's burn them! Aah! We need something to light it with. Cheryl's matches. Nathan, it's your mum! Uhh! Oh! Let it bite you, Nathan! It's the cure! Aah! No! Aah! Get away, Mum! Oh, fuck! He's gone! Nathan? Quick! Light a bale. Come on, Diggs! Get the box open! Hurry up! Hurry! He's coming! Give it to me! I'll do it! Quick! Yaah! No! Get back! Get back! Come on, Nathan. Don't do this. Please fight. Aah! Aah! Nathan! Go! Go! Nathan... Ow! Are you all right, Diggs? No, I'm not. Most of our classmates are dead. We've killed people we've known for years. We've seen other people being eaten. I know. I mean, you're supposed to make friends at school, not eat them. How are we supposed to have normal relationships from now on? Be glad you survived, Diggs. Well, I'm glad I survived, too. What's that? Oh, shit! Run! Nathan? How'd you do that? You bastard, you scared the shit out of us! Jess, I have something to ask you.
