- Subtitles - Lu?s Filipe Bernardes Who's my girl? Be careful, Sonny. Careful. - That's a nice boy. - There are some dogs coming behind you. Linda, do you realize that every time we fill this up... ...$15 more goes on the water bill? Well, we've got to keep it full till after the wedding. Hm, I wish to heaven I could keep the same weight. Who was that at the door? Oh, I knew there was something. Bookington has just wired, he's coming up to stay till the wedding. I hope our future son-in-law doesn't intend to stay with us. Oh, let me see. Oh, dear. "Arrive Santa Barbara this afternoon reserving suite at Biltmore." I think he's staying at the Biltmore. Three days and a million things to do. And now a bridegroom underfoot. If I'd known it was going to be as easy as this, I would have dispensed with the gardener long ago. - That couldn't be Bookington. - Shh! I suppose Wilbur Page isn't home. Sorry, but Mr. Page now far away. Oh, thank you. Hey, he lives here, don't he? Oh, correct. When he here, he live in here alright. Yeah, well, what time does he live here? Sometimes, but not now, please. I am very busy. Goodbye and good day. Thanks, Fugi. Just think. That might have happened when Bookington was here. Just who was our visitor? It's the man with the butcher's bill, dear... I think. Butcher's passed bills long ago, that fellow's got a summons. - A summons? - To appear in court. Oh, dear, and I haven't a thing to wear. Yes? Er... yes, this is Mr. Page. Oh yes, well, um, you see, Mr. Gross, I'm waiting now for a large payment that's coming to me. And just as soon as I get mine, you'll have your share. Yes, er, I expect it... Saturday. No, not tomorrow, Mr. Gross, a week from tomorrow. All right, Mr. Gross, I'll bear that in mind. Well, I er... Yes, sure, I realize that, Mr. Gross, Well, goodb... Oh, will I be glad to get away from all this. Bill collectors, process service, cars being repossessed, It's bad enough marrying in such a rush. But to be marrying in such a rush with nothing to be married on. Bill, bills, bills! When I shake that rice off aboard that train for New York, I'm going to lean out of the pullman window and give Santa Barbara the royal raspberry. Carolyn, what will Bookington think of his bride? After the workout that first wife gave him, he shouldn't be shocked at anything I do! Why, Carolyn, I never heard... Oh, oh! - Hiya, Fugi, old boy. Most happy for seeing you. - Mom! - Darling! Pops, old boy! Carolyn, the blushless bride. Well, folks, meet the sweet girl graduate. Graduate? Sure, the dear old alma mater finally coughed me up. Darling, I thought it was next week. I've been so busy, dear, that it just slipped my mind. Oh, it was a dead-end deal anyway. A lot of speeches, crocodile tears, fake hugs and kisses. You know, the university was glad to get rid of us and vice-versa. Oh... oh, Erp! Erp, come here. Put it down, don't be afraid. Put it down, come on! - Folks, meet Erp. - Burp? No, Erp. Erasmus Rockwell Pennington. You must know the word. Look at him! Hard as nail. Mom, Erp. Pop, Erp. Sister Carolyn, Erp. He's a national freestroke champion. And can he go! Hm... where is he going now? Right here with us. He's set for the swim meet next month. You know, the Athletic Club. And he's got to train. Say, Pop, swimming pool full? Yes, oh yes, it's full. Full to the brim. Young man, where are your trunks? Oh, was that fun! A bunch of us old grads drove down to Del Monte for breakfast... ...and we got into our suits and went for a dip at Pebble Beach. - That's where I met Erp. - In the water. Up to our necks. Bill Hinkley knew him at Dartmouth. Well, here was Erp down from Santa Barbara and... ...it was hot anyway, so we climbed into his car and buzzed right through as we were. Hasn't he any clothes at all? Oh, yes, at Del Monte, tons of them. But Erp doesn't like to wear clothes. He says they make him feel all choked up. Look at those biceps! Hey, Mom, feel those leg muscles. Feel them, come on. No... no, dear, really. Erp, give them a demonstration. Come on, hm? Just an old-fashioned home. This is a good place, you can lie down here. Isn't that swell? Look how those muscles work. Look at that intake! Oh! Fugi, there's a case of scotch in the car outside. Bring it in and start some most honorable highballs. Sure thing, yessir, ma'am. That's enough, Erp. Well, how do you like him? He breathes beautifully. Come on, Erp, we'll swim in the pool. Come on! Oh, gentleman, please. While awaiting for Mr. Page to arriving at home, will master be too tired if helping me lift this case scotch into house? Oh, thank you, please. In the house? Oh, certainly not! Not at all, sure, I'll be glad to. Come on. I don't see any reason why one guy shouldn't help another guy. Come on now, right on in the house with it, come on. I need a moment, please. Ah, sure thing, partner. Oh, is someone entering from front doorway? Well, I don't see anybody... Oh, thank you, oh! At this time, ladies and gentlemen, you will please watch closely, observing for your edification... the perfection of coordination in a one-and-a-half dive. Are you ready, Professor? Hold it, some new customers! Hold it there, Johnny! It's Maude! It's my grandmother. Same time tomorrow morning. We'll stop by and pick you up. - Yeah, keep your shoes buttoned. - I'll let you ride Daisy tomorrow. - Right! - Bye, Maude! Vic, come here, how are you? How's your game, you old gold champ? One gold, my eye, I'm a three-golder now. Say, who's the big boy up there? That's Erp. Hey, Erp! That's my new heartthrob. - And you lay off. - Oh, grow up! Maude, meet Erp. - How was that, parents? - Very cute. Yes, not bad. You play polo? - You do? - No, Maude, he means water polo. Water polo, agh! Water teedlywinks. He's the backstroke champion. Yeah? Well, let's see him stroke a back. Go ahead, Erp, do your stuff. Case of scotch I pick in Miss Vic's back seat, thank you please? Well, there is a reward for virtue. Fugi, has the beef come from Wright's market yet? - No, ma'am. - That's strange. Give me some money, dear. Fugi must go out and get some vegetables. Your future son-in-law may be here for dinner. I hope he brings the ducks. Here, Fugi, here's a quarter. Now, let me see. We'll need some avocados, and some cellery, and some lettuce, of course. - And some artichokes. - Oh, thank you, ma'am. And anything else you might see that looks nice. Get on, Erp, old boy, old boy! He sure puts the umph key into it. Nice going. Smooth as a horse's belly. He's really a nice boy, Maude, in spite of all he has to live down. Yeah, strips well too. Yes, doesn't he? Take nine boys out of ten, take their clothes off and what do they look like? You bet! Cheer up, Father. - How? - It can't last forever. I'm not worrying about forever. It's these three final days that have me down. It is ghastly. But still don't forget at the end of three days I'll be Mrs. Bookington Wells. Oh, darling, that's what makes me able to endure this ordeal. - It means your happiness, Carrie. - I wasn't thinking of that. I mean, perhaps I'll be able to relieve the situation with Bookington's help. Yes, yes, I hadn't thought of that, dear. Hello. Mother, Bookington's here. Bookington? Fugi, open the door. Fugi! Fugi! Fugi. - Fugi! - I was just putting this licor away. Oh, yes, he's gone for the vegetables. Mother, that process server is out there too. Oh....! Going in the house with those things, Mister? Why, of course. May I help you in with them? No, thank you. That process man will follow Bookie right into the house. - I'll attend to that. - Wilbur, you can't open the door! - The man will summons you. - That can't happen, it mustn't happen! - It won't happen, I'll open it. - He'll slap a summons on you, Mother. - You're just as liable as I am. - Whoa, whoa, what's all the neighing about? Bookie mustn't know about it. Who's going to open the door? Oh, shut up, I'll open it. - Oh, dear. - I think I'd better get these brakes fixed. - Is it broken? - Uh-uh. No damage done at all. I have it since I was five years old. Grandma Hawkins gave it to me. Ah, you must be coming to the wedding. - 802 Wisteria Avenue. - Hm-hmm. - Say, she's coming here. - Yes, she is, over my dead body. I haven't been around much, but I'll bet she's fresh off of somebody's farm. Oh! Oh, Arabella! I didn't mean that she should come right away. I merely wrote that as long as Grandmother Hawkins was gone... and she was alone, that sometimes... Well, it's a cinch you can't turn her out until after the wedding. Not with Bookie in on it. Cousin Carolyn married in three days? Are you sure? I ought to know, I'm the bridegroom. Then I got here just in time to help. Excuse me, lady. This trunk is awful heavy. Yes, it must be. It's the library. - The library? - Yes, the books. You see, Grandma Hawkins was a great believer in books. She had sets and sets of Dickens, and the Duchess, M.S. Clair, and Louisa May Alcott, and all the Rover Boys and Merton and Sandford, Grandma Hawkins used to say that good books was the best investment a person could make. As a stockbroker, I don't think I can agree with that. Don't tell me you're a stockbroker... Cousin Bookington. Aw, say, lady! Listen, brother, that trunk's too heavy for you. I'll carry it right in the house. - Yeah? - Sure! Come on, get it over here. Relax, I'll handle this. - Hello, Bookie, come right on in! - Good morning! Come right in. Put that trunk in the driveway outside the kitchen door. Well, family, guess who this is. Your cousin Arabella Sykes from Texas. - West Texas. - Hm-hm, West Texas. Well, well, well, princess! So this is little Arabella, what a beautiful surprise! And this is your cousin Carolyn. Oh... oh, that's my lunch. - That's all right. - I... I couldn't eat it all. I'll just, um... put it in the kitchen. Grandma Hawkins always said willful waste make woeful want. And even though it's only two cheese sandwiches... So this is Arabella. My name's Maude, do you know who I am? This is Grandmother Stanley. - Grandmother Stanley? - Yeah, but you call me Maude... ...or I'll break your young neck. - Yes, Grandmother Maude. - Maude! - Maude. - Now, that's settled. Arabella. Say, can't we arrange to call you something else? - Mother! - Well is there any harm... ...in asking a girl if she wants to change her name? Look at Greta Garbo. Wouldn't it sound nice if everybody went around calling her Gussy Gubbelheimer, or whatever her name happens to be? There's always been an Arabella in our family, you know. Yeah, always been buck teeth too, but you can have them straightened. You do say the funniest things. Say, you don't play polo, do you? Oh, goodness gracious, no. I never learned anything like that. I'm really, really not clever at all. Yeah, well as long as you realize it yourself, you can do no harm. What's that you've got hung up against your stomach there? That's my motto. Grandma Hawkins gave it to me. I was only five and it's hung right over my bed ever since. "Be good sweet maid and let who will be clever." Isn't it sweet? Well, maybe I'm wrong. It is sweet, darling, very touching. Kipling, isn't it? Oh, don't you remember, Aunt Linda? The dying mother giving advice to her innocent daughter, and then that part that says: "Do noble things, not dream them, all day long." Grandma says I should try to be just like that, so I do try to help and be kind to everyone. And if you do that, then everyone is kind and helpful to you too. - And I say if I... - Yes, let me take these things, will you? I assure you we didn't plan on having her. Oh, she's all right, dear. Quaint little thing, don't you think? Just because you're going to marry me... ...don't feel you have to whitewash all my distant relatives. I wish this one were a little more distant. Oh! Mm, I love cheese sandwiches. Victoria, this is your cousin Arabella. Hello, Arabella. Going to a barn dance? Victoria! Well, isn't she? Is someone giving a barn dance, Cousin Victoria? Not that I know of. Well, I thought if you are going, I'll let you wear my dress. You see, this is a sort of funny dress outside of Lewisville. Everybody there makes their own dresses, but I thought for this visit I ought to have something better. So I went to our best dressmaker. But after I got on the train, I began to think she hadn't done very well. Oh, that's all right, Arabella, that dress is fine. Well, I thought maybe while you were wearing my dress to the barn dance, I could wear one of yours. But there isn't any barn dance. No, but if you should want to go to a barn dance. Arabella, dear, you must be very tired. We've got to decide where we're going to put you. And this young man. - Oh, Arabella, this is Mr... - Erp. Um... yes. Now, let me see, Mr. Erp... Let me see now. All Erp needs is a place to hang his trunks. Yes. Well, he can take your room and you can sleep with me. - Swell! - And Arabella... Oh, please don't fuss over me, Aunt Linda. Treat me just like one of the family. We'll do better than that. There's a sleeping porch, Mother. Yes, the sleeping porch off Carolyn's room. It's really very nice. It's a lot better than nice, Mother. And now that summer's really here, it's the best part in the house. Oh yes, but... I prefer it to my own room in this warm weather. Oh yes, but I really couldn't take it from you, cousin Carolyn. - I don't want to be selfish. - Oh, come now, Arabella. No, I'll take your room and you can keep the sleeping porch. Grandma Hawkins always said it is more pleasant to give than to receive. Yes, but... Oh, Mother, I have so much to do in these three days. Oh, yes, I thought of that. And just when you need the fresh air... ...and everything to keep you well and strong is no time to be so unselfish, Cousin Carolyn. I won't permit it. And don't you worry about me. - I'll manage somehow. - Attagirl, Arabella! Come on, I'll show you Carolyn's stuffy old room. Oh, my trunk, Maude had it carried around the kitchen door. Erp! Cousin Arabella's trunk. Cousin Arabella's trunk... Please be careful with it, Mr. Erp, it's a sort of heirloom. Great-grandfather Hawkins bought it from a Confederate General after the Civil War. Of all the dumb... I know, dear, but after all it's only until the wedding. She didn't mean anything by it, I'm sure. The little thing is so anxious to have you like her that she's just being, er... ...too anxious. Oh, Cousin Victoria, tell him not to drop it, it might dent the floor. Wait a minute, wait a minute! It's just occurred to me, that trunk is heavy. Oh, that's all right, Bookie. Erp's in training anyway. It's good for his leg muscles. Get along, go on. Goodness gracious, I'm being such a bother, you shouldn't fuss so over me. I can manage. Darling, there's always the sewing room to dress in. Oh, it isn't that, Mother, I can't explain it to Bookington. When all those snobs show up for my wedding, how on earth am I to account for this squint on the family tree? - Shh. - She's as refreshing as the new moon hay. I can appreciate new moon hay where it belongs, out in the fields. but not when it's getting in my hair at my own wedding. The poor child is so anxious the wedding shall be a success, she's just a bundle of nerves. Yes, I can understand that. You know, I'm even getting stage fright myself. And this isn't my first performance. Come on! Last one is a big fat sissy! Chest out, stomach in and no belly flop. Go! Shame to waste all that energy on swimming. - You'd better join me, Bookie. - Thanks, Wilbur. Never touch it before dinner. Oh yes, of course, Bookington, you're dining with us. - This is such short notice, Mrs. Page. - Linda. Linda, you have so many unexpected guests. We'd love to have you. It's a small family dinner, of course. - Um, isn't that the telephone ringing? - Oh, yes, yes, the telephone! Hello? This is the Page residence. Wright's Meat Market? Oh, yes. Credit? No credit? # She'll be coming round the mountain # # When she comes, when she comes # # She'll be coming round the mountain # # When she comes, when she comes # I see, you require cash. # She'll be coming round the mountain # # When she comes, when she comes # # She'll be coming round the mountain # # When she comes, when she comes # # She'll be coming round the mountain # # She'll be coming round the mountain # # She'll be coming round the mountain # # When she comes # Yes, I understand, you won't send it. # She'll be riding six white ponies # # When she comes, when she comes # # She'll be riding six white ponies # # When she comes, when she comes # # She'll be riding six white ponies # # She'll be riding six white ponies # # She'll be riding six white ponies # # When she comes, la-la-la # # She'll be riding six white ponies... # You know, that song brings back memories. It reminds me of a day when we played the Mountaineers. - Like to hear about it? - Hm-hm. Well, it was the start of the fourth chukka. Captain Roarke was on the ball and Pembley trying to ride me off. Well, I hooked Roarke's mallet and when we were all by, they all made a swing for the ball and missed! But this time I'd swung my horse around and I came high-tailing back. Ruled off Will Rogers, he was playing number 3 for the Mountaineers. Gummed center Smith out of the way... and socked that ball... ...80 yards right through the uprights. That was the highest part of the chukka. But those are some of the biggest names in polo. They were. I think I will indulge, it'll give me a good appetite for dinner. Good evening. Is, um... is this anybody's dress? Why... but that's one of my trousseau dresses, isn't it? Oh, you see, I just tried it on, and it fits so well. We're just the same size, aren't we? And I thought, well, it's your duty to look your best here. Especially since cousin Carolyn's getting married. And I thought she'd be embarrassed if I went around in my homemade things, barn-dancing things, Victoria called them. And the dressmaker insisted on fixing my hair. Aren't you pleased I thought of it? Well, considering everything, perhaps it isn't such a bad idea. No matter what else happens, Mother, I do want the wedding to go off perfectly. Oh, I'm sure it will, Cousin Carolyn. And I'm going to help all I possibly can. Glad I'm a tall woman. Have you ever seen anyone quite so unsophisticated? Um, yes and no. I only wish I had my things here. But your trunk is here, Arabella. Oh, yes, but not my things. You know, Aunt Linda, the thing for my hair, and the thing for around my neck and... Well, all the things a girl has to have. - Where are your things? - They're at the Biltmore Hotel. You see, little old Shorty, helped me pack my trunks. He used to drive a trunk wagon for Grandpa Hawkins thirty years ago. And my things were crowded up. So, that was the only hotel he knew here and he mailed them. Oh, so you intended staying at the Biltmore. Yes, for one night, so I wouldn't be such a bother to you all. But when I rang up from the station and learned what it cost for one night, I decided to come straight out here and surprise you. That calls for another drink. Perhaps I can help here. Suppose I drive down and get them. Or I drive you down. Oh, Cousin Bookington, if you only would, but I'd hate to ask it of you. Oh, nonsense, Arabella, Bookington would be glad to. - Certainly! - Now, go right along with him. Well, um... but won't I be chilly without a wrap? The dear child is quite right. Carolyn, isn't the cape finished that goes with that dress? Yes, Mother dear. Oh, I am being a bother, but I can't help it right now. Once I get my things, I'll just turn in and help everyone as hard as ever I can. There doesn't seem to be a thing. Yes, but Shorty said he'd mail it immediately. I'm very sorry, madam, but it hasn't arrived yet. Isn't there another train due this evening? That's right, Mr. Wells, there is one at 7:10. - That's the train it's on. - We'll send our messenger down. It should be in the hotel about 7:30. - Thank you. - Thank you. Seven-thirty, an hour and a half. Maybe we could just walk around for a while. It would save you all the trouble of driving home and driving back. And you never can tell, something might happen to the car. Well, well, well, Bookie! My pal Bookie! I heard you were going to be married. And I said to myself, now, Freddie, there's a very sen... Is this the lucky little lady? No, no, no, the bride-to-be is not here tonight. This is her cousin, Miss Sykes. Arabella, this is Mr. Green. - Well, I'm very... - Do you live in Santa Barbara, Mr. Green? I thinks it's a perfectly wonderful place, that is, what I've seen of it. You see, Miss Sykes has just arrived from Texas. West Texas! You see, I was expecting a package from home. Little old Shorty mailed it. He used to drive the trunk wagon, and it hasn't arrived yet. Cousin Bookington drove me down, wasn't that sweet of him? You know, it's a funny thing. I came ashore to get the mail myself. Nothing for you, Mr. Green. Besides, you don't have to trump up an alibi for my benefit. Oh, that's no alibi, Fred. The package was addressed to the hotel here. - Is it perishable? - Oh dear, no, just things. - You know, things. - Oh, well, the little cheat! So you've got to join us. Oh, come on, now, come on. There's a party at my yacht, you know that, don't you? You know, cocktails and dinners. Why, we're three-up on you and hard to catch. I'm awfully sorry, old man, but I'm afraid... Oh, do be nice, Cousin Bookington, I'm sure Cousin Carolyn didn't expect either one of us to dinner. And it would save you all the trouble of driving all the way back and forth. All right, all right, I'll telephone Carolyn. And you, um... you talk over old times while I run upstairs and change. I'll only be a moment. Yoo-hoo, Lucille, we have company! Guess who? Surprise, surprise! Well, I can't see from here, silly. Bookington Wells and Arabella Texas. Up you go! I could never think that little old boat would hold all of us in. - I'm Mrs. Green, welcome to our ship. - Thank you. - Hello, Bookie, you old darling. - Hello, dear. Why bring Bookie aboard when you know she's here? - Shhh! - She'll embarrass everybody. No, my boy, therein lies the laugh. Oh boy, you just wait, oh boy... Oh, Fred, Fred, don't you think the folks might need refreshments? I know you do. Come on, we'll show you where. Hey, Freddie! She's up again. I'm over from the meteor and steaming, giving you a housewarming. But I thought our housewarming had cooled off. We're reheating it for you. Why, Bookie-ookie! Who are you hiding there, Bookie, number two, I'll bet. Come on, now, I read all about it, you old rascal. Hello. Er... Arabella, this... this is Charmion, my former wife, you know. Oh, hello. Listen, let me give you some advice. When you marry Bookie next week... It's next Monday, two days off really. Only I'm not marrying him at all. It's my cousin Carolyn. Oh, you should meet her, she's the sweetest thing. - This is her dress I'm wearing right now. - When you marry Bookie... When are you marrying him? Next Monday, only I'm not marrying him at all. It's my cousin Carolyn, Carolyn Page. My name is Arabella Sykes, from West Texas. - I'm not marrying anyone. - Listen, I want to give you some advice. You look like a woman who has great... ...who has great zest for life. I'm the same way, only probably more so. Let me tell you, girl, that Bookie's dead from his Adam's apple up... and down. He has no it. No it at all, that's why we couldn't get along. My man has to have it. One, two... ...and a half! Oh, Erp! Victoria, stop that noise! What's the matter with you two anyway? - We're swimming! - You know it's 6 o'clock in the morning? That's the best time to swim. Put on your suit and come on down, Carrie. And of all the men I've ever met, of course most of them have been cowboys, you are the most misunderstood. I mean, by your first wife. She told me everything. - Huh? - Yes, and I've just made a vow... way down in my heart... that I'm going to explain all about Charmion to Cousin Carolyn... ...so she won't misunderstand you too. No, no, Arabella, don't do that, no. You see... I brought that up once, about Charmion, but Carolyn feels it's a dead issue. Well, where's the country cousin? - She's still in bed. - She's up, the bed's all made. She probably looking for cows to milk. Well, I hope nobody sees her. ...I don't know what this is, I ask for a cup of coffee and all I get is dishwater. Mother, you should not play polo on an empty stomach. What you need is a lesson in anatomy. Let's go, Maude, we're waiting on you! - Come on, Maude. - I'll be right with you, boys. Some fun, eh, kid? Come on, Maude, we'll have time for two games today. And we're off! Haven't I seen that chap around here before? I'll bet he's the guard, Cousin Bookington, you know, for the wedding presents. Oh, of course. It was the greatest fun, Aunt Linda, simply thrilling. Of course I was dreadfully worried. But we were trapped out there. Absolutely helpless. Oh, I hope you weren't worried, princess. There really wasn't anything to be worried about, Cousin Carolyn. The sea was smooth as glass, only they simply wouldn't put us ashore. You know, they thought it was a joke on Cousin Bookington. Oh, no, no, no, not exactly. No, you see, they were celebrating... the Greens. You remember the Greens, you've heard me speak of them... They're charming people but very hard to get away from. And what do you think? Cousin Bookington said when you're married and have your own yacht, I must come along often. Oh, won't that be the best fun? - Coffee, children. - Hm? Oh, hot morning coffee, please. Then you've been yachting all night. I wasn't sick a bit. Mr. Green said he heard Texas boats were just natural sailers. Of course the boat didn't roll or anything. But some of the people were awfully sick, weren't they, Cousin Bookington? Must have been something they ate. Oh... Well, I hate to walk out on a party. But if I'm to be at all entertaining today, I've got to get some sleep. - This staying up all night... - Are your friends all nocturnals? Remember those people who insisted on driving us... ...to all the bars in Santa Barbara County last month till 8 o'clock in the morning? Oh, yes, the Browns. Great people the Browns. Well, these Greens sound a shade worse. Hm? Oh... Yes... well, goodbye, Linda. Goodbye, Bookington, only two more days of freedom. Yes. I know Cousin Arabella enjoyed our little outing. Oh, Cousin Bookington, you'll never never know how wonderful it was. - I say to myself... - Never mind. You can talk to yourself some other time, Bookington must have his sleep. - Good night. - Sleep tight. Oh, Aunt Linda, I never had so much fun in all my life. Of course I never ever dreamed of going on a yacht. Have you ever been on one of those boats? And has the great authoress started on her initial epic yet? Splendid time to write, isn't it, two days before one's wedding. - I'm reading, though, whenever I can. - Columbine? Yes, her latest book. You look as though you've been just where you were. Oh, we had a large time. You should have been along. I'd fit in so perfectly. You know, Arabella made a great hit with Green. "Oh, Mr. Green I'm Cousin Arabella Sykes from West Texas. I don't like know girls very much but I get along simply beautifully with men, be-be-be... Oh, darling, darling, you mustn't be so hard on little Cousin Arabella. Phooey! Aunt Linda! Where's Uncle Wilbur? Wilbur? Oh, let me see... Really, I don't know. Well, how do you feel being out all night with my almost husband? It was just wonderful, Carolyn, simply wonderful. Of course it was all my fault going down to the hotel in the first place and I feel so guilty. Cause now you won't see him again until late afternoon. Yes, I thought of that too. It does give me a clear day. You always justify yourself. I guess it just turned out for the best, didn't it? I always say you never can tell what would be a blessing in disguise if the heart is right. I'll think that over. Now suppose you climb into that bed of yours that used to be mine... ...and close those big bright eyes. You don't talk in your sleep, do you? Oh, no, I'm as quiet as a mouse. But I'm not going to sleep till nighttime. You're not? Well, Cousin Bookington was up with them all night, but I don't smoke or drink or anything, so I just slipped around till I found an empty cabin... ...and I went in and locked the door and slept till they woke me up for breakfast. Well, I battled all night long with that couch on the sleeping porch. All right, my dear cousin, you win. I wish I had your sense of humor. You say the cutest things. I just know I'm gonna love every one of you. Oh, there's Uncle Wilbur now, oh... Are you sure you can get everything for a quarter? Oh, quite certain. I have very careful buying ways. When I go home from markets, I have everything that I need for. It's the Depression. Everything is down. Even the dollar is only worth half as much. That is, until you try to buy something. Then the trades people always want a dollar for anything costing a dollar. I try to make them see I should only give tem 50c. Of course they haven't had many educational advantages. We shouldn't expect too much of them. Well, depression going on all over. Even Japan enjoying the same. Yesterday that grocery boy with red hair on head, Levon Casey, he telling me stating in newspaper, that the silkworm in Japan... ...no more giving silk. Silkworm so depressed now that the silkworm give only cotton. Only cotton, good heavens. Western Oil and Fuel, I had forgotten all about that stock. But that's because it's been inactive so long. But Cousin Bookington and Mr. Green both say everyone will remember... ...just as you did when they hear about the new oil field they discovered. It ought to go up like a rocket. I'd sure like to be on its tail. Wasn't it lucky I heard them talking it over? Of course it was so quiet in the cabin and they were sitting right under my window. When I told them I could hear everything, they just laughed... ...and Cousin Bookington said I could listen and learn, so I did. Now tell me, Arabella, did he say exactly how he was going to handle it? It's just a stock market transaction, Cousin Bookington says. He buys his stock carefully, when he has enough forces it up and then sells out. It sounds terribly simple, doesn't it? It is simple when Bookington Wells is doing it. And I thought, wouldn't it be fine, Uncle Wilbur, with all your troubles... ...if you bought some on margin and made a great deal of money? I didn't dream you knew how hard up I was. Well, I saw that process server out in front, Uncle Wilbur, when I arrived. And you only had one servant and one car and you looked so worried. I guess that worried look's become a habit. I tried to smile this morning while I was shaving, you know, just to see if I still could. But the result was not convincing. It looked as if rigor mortis had set in. Have you tried hard to think of a way to raise the money? Now and then a little, yes. - Any property? - Nothing left. The last I had was a business lot... but we ate that. No stocks or bonds? No, child, they went with the rest. - Any insurance policy? - No. That is... Grandma Hawkins said a cousin one her mother's side, who was an insurance agent, he said a person could always borrow practically... Arabella, I think I know where I can get $25,000, and if that stock... Uncle Wilbur, that would make over 100,000 profit. You mustn't breathe a word of this around here. And you mustn't tell anyone either, Uncle Wilbur. It's a great secret, but I thought it was only being kind and helpful to tell you. I'll keep it to myself, you can bet on that. Thanks, Arabella. It's really a very fine assortment for a bride. Let's see, there's bridal gown, a going away suit, one street dress, one afternoon frock, one evening gown, one outing suit, six negligees, eight nightgowns... How about the catering for that buffet after the ceremony? Or isn't there going to be any buffet? Oh, yes, your father's arranging for that. Eliminated, one buffet! - Hello! - Oh, Arabella! That dress could stand a little pressing, don't you think? Before I restore it to my trousseau. Oh, I thought so too. I was just taking it off so you could have it done. In the meantime, I'll just cuddle into this other one, this blue one. I had an awful hard time choosing between them when I put the other one on yesterday. But I thought for a young girl meeting her family for the first time... ...the white one might be better. But now that we do know one another more, I think I'll just go around in this for a while. I'd like to make a request. Don't get into the one hanging over next to the north wall by mistake. That happens to be my wedding gown. Oh, Carolyn, you're just the cleverest girl. I wish I could say funny things the way you do. But poor me, I'm just dumb. I never contradict anybody. Oh, Wilbur. - Wilbur, I'm so worried. - Well... what are you worried about... darling? - It's Victoria. - Ha. Well, wh-what's happened to her? She and that young man without any clothes... went down to the club early this morning... ...and started to swim out to Ted Winter's yacht. But Alma Spalling was just in to see Carolyn... ...and she said that Ted Winter's yacht is in Honolulu. Well, then... where are the two youngsters? That's what's worrying me so. I called up the club and the steward said they had started to swim. Arabella's going down and look for them. There you are. Where is everybody? Here's a radiogram for Mr. and Mrs. Page. - Radio? - Gram, yes! It's a message from a ship. Oh, I see now. Will hasten upstairs with same. I just slipped into this, it's from your trousseau isn't it? - I thought so. - So did I. It's a sort of outing costume, and heaven knows those two are out somewhere. Mrs. Page, ma'am. Oh, Mrs. Page, ma'am! Oh, message floating in from ocean. Oh, I know it's bad news. Hello, folks, here we are on the Oceania Sea yacht... ...bound for Ensenada to get married. See you in the funny papers, Vic and Erp. - Married? - Not yet Mother, they're just on their way. - Married in bathing suits! - Oh, it's better than nothing. But they mustn't be married, we won't permit them to be married. Pardon, Ma'am, but Mr. Bookington here. He awaiting downstairs please. Thank heavens Bookington is here, he can advise us. They're getting married. In bathing suits, on a whim! Hm. - Ensenada, hm? - Ensenada, that's in Mexico. Marriages in Mexico aren't any good, are they? Yes, they are, Aunt Linda. It's divorces you're thinking of. I'm sure marriages are all right there. At least I hope so, because I feel sort of responsible, Why on earth should you feel responsible? Well... because I suggested it to Erp. You suggested the marriage? Oh, Arabella! Last night they were down at the club swimming... ...and while we were waiting for Mr. Green's launch, Erp and I had a nice long talk. You had a nice long talk with Erp? When you gain his confidence, he talks quite a lot. And after he told me about himself, I immediately advised... ...advised him to marry Cousin Victoria. - You advised him? - They have so many things in common. Swimmimg, and diving, and being in the water and... Oh, Arabella, how could you, how could you? Now, take it easy, old girl, take it easy. - I think it's awfully nice. - Yes, but... I'm sure Arabella didn't mean any harm. My poor baby, she's only a college girl. She hasn't any mind of her own. There, there now, easy, easy... If we could only reach them and have a sensible talk. Well, if you're really opposed to it... Opposed to it? Child, you've ruined my baby's life. And mine too, I had such hopes. Such vastly different hopes. Well, when I told Mr. Green I'd never been in an airplane... That's right! He told me I could take his plane any time I wanted to. We could fly down to Ensenada and head them off. Oh, I pray you get there in time. It's right at the club airport too and the pilot's always there too. Well! We'll be back in four or five hours, princess. Uh... we're not seeing much of each other, are we? If you can just prevent a misalliance that our country cousin has arranged. She is a busy little thing, isn't she? Well, um... see you in the funny papers. Bring back the Katzenjammer Kids. - Take good care of yourself, Bookie. - Thanks, Wilbur. Cousin Bookington, have you done anything about those stocks? Indeed I have. I've got my operators beating the price down... and when it's down to nowhere, then I'll buy it. Oh, I see. Before you send it up, you're going to beat it down. - And down, and down... - That's it. Well, goodbye, Wilbur. That's right, goodbye. Come on, bring him in, boys, bring him right in here. Come on, bring him here, put him on the other couch. Lay him right down here... There you are, Pete. Hurry up, give me some hot water and liniment. My gosh. Oh, dear, is the man hurt? Yeah, why he tried to block me off when I was on the ball. Well, it was the end of the game, you had us beat anyway. Yeah, we beat them 12 to 3. I'd have made 13 goals if Morton hadn't stumbled. Just think, I'm going on an airplane ride. Of course it's to relieve Aunt Linda's mind. Oh, but I know I'm going to enjoy it. When Carolyn and I are married, I'm going to buy her an aeroplane. And then you can come on all our trips with us. Oh, thank you, Cousin Bookington! - How's that feel, Petie, huh? - Much better. Hm, polo's a rough game. Even for horse it's a rough game. When I'm finally married, in spite of polo, riots, bill collectors, Arabellas and all other acts of God, I'm not going on a honeymoon. It'll be a rescuer. Hello, hello! Hel... W.H. Spears and Company? Listen, Bill, did you buy that stock for me? All of it, huh? The whole $25,000? On margin. Oh, boy... What? Oh, yes, sure, it's all right. Sure... just what I ordered. # Se?orita # # There's a twinkle in your eye # # And you seem to say that I # # Might be welcome by and by # # In your little hacienda # # By the light of the moon, se?orita # # On a balmy night like this # # It would never be a miss # # To bestow a little kiss # # So you might as well surrender # # To the spell of the moon up high # # Moon I could but I didn't # # You're safe # # If you say nay # # And run away from love # # What are you thinking of? # # Se?orita # # When you look at me and smile # # Is it only to beguile # # Will I ever pass the stile # # Of your little hacienda # # By the light of the moon # No word from them at home. I think they must still be coming down, Cousin Bookington. Because when people want to get married, well... they just want to get married... ...more and more. That is right. But when people wish to get unmarried, they also wish to get unmarried more and more. - Is that not so, Bookie? - Why bring that up, Jos?? You think we ought to see it through? Hombre, ma?ana por la ma?ana... Oh, I mean... On tomorrow morning, I bet you my life... you will look down into Ensenada bay... and, whoopie, there will be the ship sailing in. That's what I think. Well, that makes it unanimous. We'll inquire once more at the Marine lookout... and if there's no news, I'll send a final wire that we're staying over, hm? - Se?or! - Hm? I am chaperone for $5 for the evening. But now the evening is getting finished. Isn't that a shame? I guess we'll have to go alone then. - Oh... - Let's go this way... It must be lovely to have a home at the beach. Of course I never will have. Unless maybe a tent or something. But I always say it's almost as much fun to dream about things than to have them. When Carolyn and I are married, I'm going to buy her a beach house. And then you must come down and visit us, often! Oh, thank you, Cousin Bookington! Johnny, hand me up that cockeyed Cupid. Coming up like a storm, Maude. Here you are. - Got it? - Hm-hmm. Well, there probably won't be any wedding today anyhow. The bridegroom hasn't shown up yet. You'll have as fine a buffet, Mr. Page, as though you've paid spot cash. And the orchestra, that will be here all right? - Just like I said. - That's fine. I certainly appreciate that, Mr. Levy, and, um... As for the money, I promise you I'll pay the note in sixty days right on the dot. I'd cheer up if I were you, Linda. No sense in wetting down your daughter's wedding. Marrying a millionaire... ...and a mighty nice fellow too. It's so selfish of Wilbur. We agreed we'd never touch my annuity, never, never, under any circumstances. Yeah, but when the milk is spilt, there's no use pretending it's still in the cow. Taking the advice of an addle-headed girl. And Victoria yachting somewhere, shipwrecked for all we know. And suppose the aeroplane crashes with Bookington. We'd have to put the wedding off until tomorrow. Well, sure looks pretty good. Well, let's run, fellows. - Yeah, we have that race in two hours. - Yeah, hard work, boys. What would happen to me if you should die tomorrow? Why postpone it till tomorrow? Maude! Maude! - Polo? - You've earned it! Ten o'clock, the wedding's 2:15... Yes, I've just got time to make it, 1:55. I know that's that man. Is Mr. Wilbur Page home today? Last man in the car gets to sweep up after the wedding! W.H. Spears? Yes, it's Mr. Page again. - It's down another point. - Wilbur... - Lovely day for a wedding. - I can't help it, Carolyn. What with the annuity and Victoria both gone. Both calamities ar bright ideas of angel Arabella. Oh, oh... more bad news. - I hope is not so. - Oh, dear! "Arabella and I returning immediately. No news of Oceania Sea yacht. Back in plenty of time for wedding. Love to my princess, Bookington Wells." Nothing about the stock? Well, I can finish my book in peace, only three more pages. If I only knew how Victoria was. There's so much to do. Oh, Carolyn, at a time like this how can you sit there and read a worthless book? I suppose you'd rather have me running around doing a lot of useless worrying. I certainly prefer this book, and it isn't worthless. As a matter of fact, the author of this Columbine is a rather remarkable person. And I hope some day to be like her. More gramradio. Oh, most exciting. It's from Vic. "Married outside 12-mile limit. By captain of gambling ship. Congratulations. Back in plenty of time to help Carolyn get married. It's a great idea and everybody ought to try it at least once. Love to all, Vic and Erp." Heavens, married by a sea captain. Like common sailors. W.H. Spears? Yes, it's Mr. Page again. Down another point. Here's Bookington now. He wouldn't be so late, only he telephoned us from San Diego... ...that he had to stop there for something. Arabella probably ran out of gas. - Give me that suitcase. - Yes, sir. The guests are arriving, I guess we're not too late. I'll have to rush right up and change. Bookington, you'll have to dress in Arabella's room, I'm afraid. Wilbur's room is full of women's hats and things. You know how it is with weddings. Well, you will. Oh, Arabella, where are you going to dress? Now, don't you worry about me, Aunt Linda. You have enough to think about, I'll manage somehow. I wish Victoria was here, we so seldom have a wedding. Wedding are in garden, please. Just a minute, please, have you got invitation for entering into wedding? I don't need no invitation. Well, are very unlawful for process server to breaking in or entering without invitation... ...so to do from family man. Hey, what are you trying to do, pull the law on me? - Where'd you learn that stuff? - Where? I am studying for barroom, oh, thank you. Goodbye. Goodbye. Oh no, you don't, wait for me! Gangway! Oh, Carolyn! Didn't we get here just in time? And when Cousin Bookington phoned from San Diego... ...and you told him about Vic and Erp being married, well, I knew you all didn't approve at first... ...but I'm sure you're gonna be just terribly pleased once you get to know Erp... ...and what a sterling character he is. I always say you never really appreciate a man... ...until times of adversity. And heaven knows these are times of adversity, so you ought to begin liking Erp very soon. Yes, it is a little creased, isn't it? Well, I trust I'll just have to get into something else for the wedding. I don't know just what exactly you're going to get into, Arabella, with three of my trousseau dresses waiting for the cleaners already. I'm afraid the supply won't equal the demand. Why, I wouldn't think of wearing any more of your dresses, Cousin Carolyn. You've more than sweet and generous about them already. It was just to keep from causing you embarrassment that I accepted them at all. Oh, no, for the wedding I'll just slip into my own little frock. - You know, the one I... - Oh no, Arabella, don't! - I surrender. - Oh, you say the funniest things. Well, when I was planning and thinking about the wedding the other day, I said to myself, now look your best and be a credit to your cousin... This is the one you ought to wear. I'll just snuggle into this and then see if you don't think I was right. Doctor Duncan, it won't be but a moment now. It's Mr. Page again. Down another point. - Oh, Wilbur, how could you... - There, there, dear, now don't get upset. It's the wedding, you know how mothers are. Indeed I do, I cried right up to the moment of Helen's marriage. Remember, dear, you're not losing a daughter, you're gaining a son. She knows that. I... Alright, boys, bring him in and be careful, that was a bad fall. Oh dear, oh dear! It's my roughness injures these boys, I feel it's up to me to take care of them. But won't the wedding interfere? That's right. Well, we'll put him upstairs out of sight somewhere. Take him away, boys, take him away. Get him up there quick. Put him in any room you find, it's all right. Grandma Hawkins always said it was bad luck for people to cross on the stairs. Well, didn't Grandpa Hawkins ever say anything? Oh, Aunt Linda, I do so want to help. Can't I do something? I could take Fugi's place if you need him. Why, yes, child, you open the door. Fugi, you go and help Mr. Levy, will you? Thank you, ma'am. Bring him right in here, boys. Sorry, Bookie, sorry. Put him right on the bed here. Got in my way, that's all. I hope he isn't badly hurt. I just bounced him off his horse and bounced the ball off his bean. Maude was certainly hot today. Get him a glass or something, I've got to get dressed. You'll find a bottle in my bag. Right out in the garden. Hey! Arabella! - Where's Carolyn? - Well, she... Oh... we're just in time! Here, it's our wedding present. - Another college prank, I suppose. - No, open it! I'm sorry, I don't think it's a little bit funny. Carrie, that's a good check. And there's a lot more where it came from. Don't you know? Say, I guess we never told you. Erp is, um... you know that author, you're always reading her books. - Well... - She's my mother. - Victoria! - Mother... Then... then you're really Lord Pennington. What? He was... That is, we want to keep the Lord business hushed up. What would we look like rushing around a swimming meet... ...with a title tattooed on our torsos? Well, then this $25,000 check isn't rubber. Darling, what are you talking about? Erp was left a million when his father died, and there's lots more now. - A million dollars? - Pounds. Oh, you two naughty children, I haven't kissed you yet. Run along, run along. Oh, thanks for the check, Cousin Arabella. You didn't realize you were arranging such a fabulous marriage. Oh, yes, Cousin Carolyn, he told me all about it that night. So I explained, he was in love with Vic and ought to marry her immediately. It seemed such a good time to bring a little money into the family. Darling, here comes Bookington now. I'm awfully sorry, dear, I was detained. Oh!!! You know the old saying! Grandma Hawkins said when the bride and groom meet on the wedding day... ...before the ceremony, something terrible will probably happen. Let me see... Bookington, you ought to be out with the Minister. Aren't you coming along too? Well, I thought I heard an auto. When Carolyn and I are married, I'm going to buy her an auto. And then we'll go... Bookie, I've got to tell you. - Arabella... - I know, she explained everything to me. That's why we stopped off in San Diego. I started my men into buying immediately. - Forcing it up? - Yes. In thirty days you'll be able to cash in for five times your investment. Oh, Bookie! Oh, darling! Oh boy, oh boy! Did you hear, Erp gave me a present of $25,000. Oh, that's nothing. I'm going to make 100,000 in thirty days. Just when I don't need it, I get it. Well, it looks like my problems are over. Lady, this paper is very important and I must give it to Mr. Page personally. Well... I hope I'm doing right... He's out in the garden giving the bride away. Oh, yeah? Hey, you! You get out of here! You get out! Lady, I was invited here! I gotta right to... Throw him in, Mrs. Stanley. Why did you ever let this hyena in here? Well, I thought if I were kind and helpful to him, he might be kind and helpful to me. Who in tarnation ever heard of a kind and helpful hyena? If any man can show just cause why they may not lawfully be joined together, let he now speak or else hereafter forever hold his peace. Wait a minute, I've got something to say about this wedding. Before you do any business here, you've got to take me into consideration. By what right do you appear here? Who are you? I'm his wife, that's all. Just his wife. You'll have to make another settlement if you want to get rid of me. And this time it will be $200,000. But we're divorced! Not until I sign the divorce papers, Bookie-ookie, not till then. You got the divorce in Ensenada, and that's law of California. Not of the States, Provinces or something of Mexico. And nobody's divorced down in that province until both parties sign. Are you sure you know what you're talking about? Do you think I'd be here if I wasn't sure? I spent the last 24 hours looking it up. I'll tell the world I'm sure. Well, Bookington, I think that calls us quits. For a big businessman, you were curiously negligent. Oh, no hard feelings. Erp through Arabella has made it possible for me to go to New York and write... ...and leave Santa Barbara behind me forever, that's all I want. - But, Princess, whatever... - I'm sorry, Bookington, let's skip it. It was probably a big mistake anyway. - Just a moment! - Erp! This woman here is all wrong. Erp, we'd better go inside... I study Law for one thing. And for another, my two uncles were divorced in Mexico. Did you establish a bona fide residence there? That's just it. I resided in Ensenada for six months before applying for a divorce. Then your divorce is legal and final in any country. My friends, this young hombre is in the right. I, I secured divorce for Se?or Wells. And I am going to tell the world I am right. A fine steer you gave me! You must have been drinking, you and your grandma Hawkins. Well, you big palooka, I almost got into you for another pot of dough. All right, go ahead and marry him. And may you both choke to death on your wedding cake. Oh, but it's not I who's marrying him, it's Cousin Carolyn. But if Carolyn really doesn't want you... You... You mean you'd take me? Well... if nobody else will, it's been such a shock to you. - You did expect to be married. - Uh-huh. Oh! Yes, it's the happiest day of my life. A hundred thousand in thirty days? Oh, Mr. Levy! This is Mr. Wilbur Page. Do your stuff. Well, so you're Wilbur Page, huh? Well sir... Oh, Arabella! Here's the bridal gown. You might as well have the whole trousseau. Thank you dearly, Cousin Carolyn! Isn't that so... She does the cutest things! - Subtitles - Lu?s Filipe Bernardes
