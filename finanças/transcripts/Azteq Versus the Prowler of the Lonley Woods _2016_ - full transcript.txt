Hey, babe, do you mind grabbing that blanket? Not at all. Thanks. You got it? Oh, perfect. Do you like it? Hey, grab a beer. You know, I hope you're enjoying yourself. So far. It's not every day we get to spend, you know, our one year anniversary together as a couple. I know. So, cheers to us? Mm hmm. Cheers to one year. Hold on. I love you, sweetheart. I know. Johnny! What the? During the heyday of the Aztec Empire there existed an order of knights known as the Jaguars, who were a trained militia which vowed to die protecting their homeland. The head of the order was the god of war Mixcoatl. From a very early age, the young boys were trained in the art of warfare and hand-to-hand combat. The senior soldiers wore masks to inflict terror on their enemies, and the hearts of their prisoners became the raw materials to satisfy the blood lust of their god. A severe drought, in conjunction with the bloody Spanish invasion of 1525, was the beginning of the end of this great empire. After the Spanish genocide, a brave general of the order named Aztek Tecpicalli, meaning the Great Warrior, was among the lucky few who escaped to distant lands. For generations, the descendants of Tecpicalli continued to train in Aztec martial arts and the use of the great warrior mask, which would seal their commitment to protect and shelter the weak and underprivileged. Today, Aztek Wildcat, a direct descendant of General Aztek Tecpicalli, continues this legacy of honor, justice, and dignity. Aztek, you're up next. Aztek, Aztek, Aztek, Aztek, Aztek. You suck! Business out there. Ladies and gentlemen, the following contest is for the Aztec Lucha League Heavyweight Championship and is scheduled for one fall. Introducing first, your challenger, weighing in at 155 pounds, from Mexico City, the Aztek Wildcat! Astek, Aztek, Aztek, Aztek, Aztek, Aztek, Aztek, Aztek, Aztek, Aztek, Aztek, Aztek, Aztek, Aztek.

Ladies and gentlemen, the winner and new Aztec Lucha League Heavyweight Champion, the Aztek Wildcat! Aztek, Aztek, Aztek! Aztek, Aztek, Aztek, Aztek, Aztek, Aztek, Aztek, Aztek, Aztek! Hey, pumpkin face. Hey, pumpkin face. Try this, it might look better. Yeah, pumpkin face. Stupid pumpkin face. Why do they do this to you? I'm so sorry. Staying busy there, Chief? What kind of world are we living in? One bad season, this becomes a baseball town. What you got for me, Chris? Found the body of a young man, early 20s, out by Lake Fort yesterday. Johnny Montana, according to his ID. Found beside the lake, not in it. It's not uncommon to find a dead body out there. You suspect the Mexican drug cartels? No, there doesn't appear to be a clear motive. Witnesses say that they saw the victim leaving with his girlfriend. Now, he was slashed to death, but there's no sign of the girlfriend's body anywhere. Is she a suspect? Person of interest at the moment. Who found the body? Park ranger. Makes it a federal case then, Chris. FBI's gonna handle it. Yeah, but it's my jurisdiction. Let me see what I can do about getting your hands in on it. If we end up waiting for the feds, you and I could both be playing bingo at some retirement village. You know how that works, Chief. You know, the truth is, we got a young man who's been slashed to death, his girlfriend is missing, and somebody out there is looking for some major attention. I'm gonna find out who did it. I promise you that. All right. Looking good today, keep it up. Nice. Don't look at me, keep it real, babe. Nice. It looks like you found the perfect spot. God, it's so warm out here. Okay, I think we're done for today. Are you sure? Positive. We'll complete the photo shoot next week. We have about two months to finish the calendar. Well, just let me know what you're looking for. I have a lot of fresh ideas. Maybe something more sexy next week, more provocative, maybe a wet t-shirt or something. Okay. I'll think of a location later. You can put your clothes on. Jerry? Is that you? Jerry! It's not funny! It's not gonna work today. Jerry, stop playing, shit. It's not nice! Oh, fuck! We have to start our interview now, Aztek. Can I please take this call? It's important. Thank you. Hello? Hey, Ivie, everything okay? I'll be there soon. No, it's not okay. I'm completely disgusted with and disappointed in you, Aztek. We were supposed to meet for dinner an hour ago. Where are you? Uh, I know, and I'm sorry. It's just that, you know how it is when a bunch of journalists show up at the locker room and they just wanna, you know, continue asking questions. In the five months that we've been dating, you've given me so many excuses. Come on now, you know that's not true. No, since we've been together, you've let me down so many times I can't even keep track anymore. I know and I'm sorry but, I promise, I'll be there in 10 minutes. Just give me 10 minutes and I'll be there. Maybe some women are okay with the crazy, unpredictable lifestyle of dating a pro wrestler, but I'm not! Ivie, can you please just let me talk for just a second? No, you let me talk. I want someone I can depend on. I'm leaving right now. I've been waiting for an hour, and where's my boyfriend? Taking care of some stupid interview? Okay, so I'll meet you Guanajuato Mexican restaurant. I'll be there in 10 minutes. Please don't let me down again, Aztek, or this will be the end of us. I won't, I promise I'll be there as soon as possible. You better be. Hey, guys, sorry, is there any way we can do this interview at another time? I'm already late for a date and my girlfriend is not very happy. Well, okay, give me a call when you have time. Thank you very much. I swear, I'll call. Whatever, let's go. Pete. Hi, excuse me. I'm looking for my girlfriend, blonde, attractive, about, you know, mid-20s. Hmm, would she be the one who was sad, frustrated, and angry while having a phone conversation? Yeah, that's her, why? She left this for you. - Oh Lord. - She's been gone about 20 minutes now. Okay. Thank you. You know, I really love you, Jenny. Did you think about me when you were in Iraq? Always, babe. I know that's not true. There is no way you could've thought about me every single day, but that's okay. You know, I thought about you every single day. Oh yeah? I did. At first, I was mad at you for leaving, but then I just thought of you and hoped I'd get to see you again. I don't understand what you're trying to tell me. It's simple. I thought you were gonna marry Carly, but then she started seeing Leo, and when that happened, I thought, you know, maybe you'd start looking my way. I have a feeling I'm pushing you into this. That's not true at all. You're not pushing me into anything. Now what? I'm sorry, it's just, you're going too fast. I don't think so, babe. What? Somebody's here, James. Oh, come on, no one's gonna see us. No, I'm serious. I'm serious, we gotta go. We gotta go. You have nothing to worry about, babe. You're completely safe here. Okay. No, no! No, put me down! Please, stop! Fuck, put me down! Put me down, please! Jenny? James? We have to go. Kid, come on, push. Push, come on, push! Push! Come on, push it. It's a piece of cake, kid. Come on, let's make it, come on. There ya go, come on, hit it again, hit it! Hit it! There ya go, get mad at it. Get mad at it, kid, come on. All right. You ready to do this? Yes, sir. All right, let's do it, come on. Let's get it. Welcome back to earth, kid. I've noticed you've been introspective lately. As of late, I've been having a lot of issues having to channel all my fears into one agreement. Well, normally we don't face our fears, but we have the gift to challenge the outcome of that what we cannot control. To face it. Then our fears and frustrations will vanish. By doing this, we can grasp the freedom of our minds. But what I don't seem to understand is that, why is it that everything that we love the most always seem to be in the places that we fear the most. What's your biggest fear, Aztek? Getting kicked in the balls during a match. Seriously? What is your greatest fear? Honestly, probably facing a bigger opponent. Maybe losing my title. Or maybe just losing the person that I love the most. So, what's your concern? You're successful at both. Great, yeah. Seriously, don't be without hope, Aztek. When you're confronted with disappointment and the things that we go through in life, that puts us on the path to our destiny. You know, when Dad passed away, he had reminded me and told me that only the dead have seen the end of our innermost fears. According to the Yamakia Code, there are spiritual talents that cannot be taught, but we have to experience them to understand, even death. What are you saying? You know, sometimes I have a really hard time trying to understand your riddles. The life of the Aztec warriors was an endless battle. It was a continued warfare of capturing the prisoners to sacrifice for the gods. And to gain respect, the recruiter had to take his hostages. After capturing his four enemies, he was entitled the Jaguar. So you need to decide what four enemies you have in life and capture them. Oh, so how do I do that? It's like the Jaguar, he's opportunistic, calculating, preferring to face the strong, more clever, powerful prey, like the fox, the coyote, the tapir, the anaconda. Hey, babe, can I get a five, please? Hey, babe, it's just $5. Can't you hear, don't you understand? A single. Texas ID, credit card. Too slow. Who the hell you think you are? Your worst nightmare. Really, how about a little one-on-one then? All right. Please don't kill me. Why are you giving our people such a bad name? Excuse me, ma'am? I think this belongs to you. Thank you very much. I thought this was history. Do me a favor, though. Just be careful, these streets are really not that safe. Okay. Are you okay, though? - Yes, I'm fine, thank you. - Okay. Hey, buddy, what's your name? Robbie. Robbie, huh? Robbie, can you do me a favor? Yeah. Can you take care of your mom? - Yes, sir. - Okay. Hey, masked man. What's your name? My friends call me Aztek. Come on! You stupid car! Come on. Seriously? Why here? Really? Fuck! No, no, no! Somebody help me! No, what the fuck? Let me go! No, no, no, no, please! Please let us go. We won't tell anyone, I promise, we haven't seen your face. I swear. No! No. It's gonna be all right. You're gonna be okay. Please, let is go! Get away from me! Please let us go, please. Touch me again and I'll fucking cut your balls off! Please. You don't have to do this. Excuse me. Are you Aztek Wildcat? Yes. Am I in trouble? Detective Chris Longley, Fort Worth Police Department. I'd like to ask you a few questions. Sure, please. What can I help you with, Detective? Wait, this is Ivie. Is she alive? Ivie Proctor was reported missing 24 hours ago by her roommate. Now the report also stated that she had a rather turbulent love affair with you. Well, I wouldn't call it turbulent. I mean, her and I, yes, we had some issues, but, as a mater of fact, that's a little too personal and you're asking way too many questions. If you care about Ivie Proctor, please, answer the question. Yes, her and I, we had a relationship. But it just didn't work out. You know, we had differences of ideas. Me, my career. Her, her idea of personal quality time. Again, it just didn't work out. Thursday, a young woman discovered the body of US Army veteran James Filgerber at the Forest Reserve at Fort Lake Park. Now, as you can see, the body reveals repeated stab wounds to the neck, all right around the jugular area. Now, the interesting thing about our victims here is they were all accompanied by their girlfriends, with the exception of what we assume is just a jogger, wrong place, wrong time. And then we have Ivie, who was abducted alone. So, as of right now, all four of these women are missing. Am I a suspect? To be honest with you, I don't see a motive. You have no criminal history. I've interviewed several people of good reputation who all say that you're a fine, honorable citizen. Let me ask you something, Detective. Do you have any clues? Just a few. This guy, he's either clever or lucky, but he knows the woods, so we're dealing with either a true psychopath or a sexual predator. Now, let me ask you something else. Does a psychopath usually tend to go for the attractive women? Yes and, in this case, they're all blondes. You think he's just going after the women and then just the men are just becoming collateral damage. Yeah, it's a little odd, but we think what we're dealing with here is a guy whose killing is not his main motive. He's a collector, he's a hoarder of human beings. I mean, I am positive we'll find all of these women alive somewhere. Well, I'm gonna go out tomorrow morning to where one of the bodies was found and look around. So at this time, I don't have any further questions. Detective, are you going out there on your own? Of course I'm going out there on my own. I'm a cop, that's my job. I apologize, I didn't mean to, for it to come out that way, and I'm sorry, I'm not judging your expertise. I'm just trying to help out in anyway I can. If you think of anything, just give me a call. All right? Thanks for your time. Detective, take me with you. What? No, no, no, no, no, you're much better off staying right where you are. Come on, Detective, let me help you. I promise, you won't regret it. Look, I know how you're feeling. I mean, really, I do. Come on, I'm just asking you, let me help you. I promise, you won't regret it. Let me think about it. Come on, there's nothing you can think about. What else, are there gonna be more girls that are gonna get kidnapped or there's gonna be more dead bodies, which is it? All right. Payback or justice? Justice, I hope. All right, come by my office tomorrow morning at seven am. Don't be late. You got forms to fill out. Wait, wait, forms? Come on, detective, I'm not looking for a job. Yeah, well, we still gotta run a background check on you. I mean, I don't know who you are. Yeah, I've heard you're a well-known wrestler, but I don't know the real you, you know what I'm saying? I get it. I got nothing to hide, so go ahead and do what you gotta do. I have one more question. How come you never take the mask off in public? This is my culture, this is my heritage. You know, this is what I resemble being an Aztec warrior, but it's something that you probably wouldn't understand where I'm coming from. No, no, no, no, I'm listening. Okay, well, like I was telling you, this is my culture, this is something that has been passed on from generation to generation, and I'm honored that I'm carrying on with this culture, but let me ask you something else. Have you ever heard probably one of the most famous wrestlers out there, Blue Demon? Aztek something or other, I don't know lucha libre wrestling, it's just all, you know, it just seems... Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, before you even cross that line, let me just tell you, this is very real. I take this very seriously. And, again, I don't expect for you to understand where I'm coming from with this. Don't take it personally. Just, to me, it all seems really fake. Okay, remember, tomorrow, seven am, and, what you did yesterday with the young woman and the kid, that was impressive. I mean, that was very impressive. Well, Detective, every witness out there will not tell you the story of how it truly is. You should know better than anyone. Woo, let's go! Yeah! Ladies and gentlemen, introducing first, in the corner to my left, he weighs in at 255 pounds, from Los Angeles, California, he is Tsunami! Hey, come on. And in the corner to my right, he is your current Heavyweight Champion, weighing in at 165 pounds, from Mexico City, Mexico, the Aztec Warrior! Aztek, Aztek, Aztek, Aztek, Aztek. Yeah, Tsunami! Yeah! Woo! Aztek, Aztek, Aztek, Aztek, Aztek! Tsunami, Tsunami! What the fuck, ref? Two, three, four! Let's go Aztek! Come on, Aztek! Tsunami! Two, three, four! Aztek, Aztek, Aztek! You suck, Tsunami! You go to hell! Come on, Aztek! Tsunami, Tsunami! He's cheating! Okay, Aztek! Come on! Let's go Aztek! Let's go Aztek! Tsunami, Tsunami! Tsunami, Tsunami, Tsunami! Tsunami, Tsunami! Stay down! - Two! - Stay down! Three! That's it. Come on. Come on. Aztek, Aztek, Aztek! Aztek, Aztek! You already whipped his plow! Let's go Tsunami! Let's go Tsunami! What do you say? What do you say? Come on, what do you say? You gotta tell me! Do you give up? Rope grab, come on! Two, three, four! Nobody's harder to beat than Aztek. - Tsunami! - Sucks! - Tsunami! - Sucks! - Tsunami! - Sucks! - Tsunami! - Sucks! - Tsunami! - Sucks! Sucks! Tsunami! Aztek, Aztek! Tsunami! One, two, three! Ladies and gentlemen, the winner of your match, the Aztek Warrior! Aztek, Aztek, Aztek, Aztek, Aztek, Aztek, Aztek, Aztek, Aztek, Aztek, Aztek! Good job tonight, Aztek, you really popped that crowd. The only thing I don't get, man, is that why you gotta go out there and start acting like a fool, man? I thought you were a. See that's the new name of my game. It's called rude dog. You're such an asshole, you know that? Just remember, don't turn your back on me. You know I'm coming back for that rematch. Why you gotta say that, man? You ever been punched and kicked in the body 600 times in a single night? It bothers you after a while, you know? Why are you asking me that? You already know the answer. Because that's what's gonna happen to you if we have another rematch. Oh, by the way, take care of my belt, I'm coming back for it sooner than you think. All right, we'll see about that. By the way, Aztek, I'm really sorry about Ivie. Man, why you gotta say that for? Master, Our Lord, Lord of the Mirror, of the Night, of the Wind, poor am I. In what manner shall I act for thy city? In what manner shall I act for thy government, for my people? I am blind, I am death, and I am an imbecile, and filth hath my lifetime been. Perhaps thou mistake me for another. Perhaps thou seekest another in my stead. Aztek, where are you? You were supposed to be here at seven am. All right, you still have to fill out that paperwork, okay? I'm gonna head out to the lake. Meet me there. Look. This is the necklace that I gave Ivie. Okay, according to my GPS, this is where the young lady found the body of US Army veteran James Filgerber. So, Detective, what do you think we're looking for? I don't know, but when I figure it out, I'll tell ya. Well, that's a good plan. All right, well, Aztek, do you see anything unusual? No. But I can tell you somebody's watching us. How do you know? I can sense it. Okay. Aztek! Come on. Come on. Come on, I need you, come on. What the hell are you made of? Aztek! Come on. Man, you okay? - Yeah. - All right. Man, I'll tell you what, if I didn't let those other two take me down, I wasn't gonna let him take me down. But you know what, it ain't over yet. You ready? - Yeah. - All right, let's go. This has to be it. Oh, this place smells like shit! Man, I don't know how anybody could live under these conditions. I wonder, pal. You wanna take a wild guess who this is? Surprise me, Aztek. That's a good guess. Still, we're gonna need to have a more thorough examination by the coroner. Man, this guy was out of his mind. Or maybe just disturbed by a series of horrible episodes in his wretched life. Hey, wait, you hear that? God, yes. Let's go. Please! Please, please, let us go! - Where is he? - He's dead. Is he coming back? No, he's not gonna hurt anybody anymore. Can you just untie me, please? Sure, sure. I'm glad you're okay, Ivie. It's okay, I'm here. I know you are. You're finally here, you made it on time. I would never let you down, babe. He volunteered to come with me today. He was very convincing. I know. It's over now. Hey, ladies, he's dead. How do you know, who killed him? You did? Well. You really are crazy, you know that? - Yeah. - Yeah. That guy's nuts. Hey, I'm glad to hear that. He can also be a complete pain in the ass, too. Tell me about it. Oh, I missed you. Good work, Longley. Now, we're gonna have to discuss why you disappeared for an entire day with just civilian backup. How you feeling? You know what, little bit of a headache, my hand, it'll be all right. He's a pro wrestler, he can take way more than this. - What? - Don't be modest, babe. You know what I'm talking about. - Come on. - He seems like a pretty tough guy. Well, more than average guys, but you know what? I have a gung-ho type of spirit. Really now? - I do, yeah. - Okay. No, not an average guy. Well, most average than anybody else, but, you know. What do you know about this guy? His name was Edward Lee Carver, 35 years old, raised by a single mother, no record of who the father was. Now, we're guessing that he was about 15 years old when his mother passed away. He spent the last five years of his life in various mental institutions. The mummified corpse that we found inside, possibly the mother, and looks like he never reported her death to the authorities, so I just gotta confirm his date of birth and then just talk to the locals out here and find out how he survived. - So, Aztek. - Yes? You came to the restaurant that day, didn't you? I did, but, you know, things got a little complicated after that. Let's just take it from here, let's start over from here. You cool with that? Well, you already know I am. And, besides, I already got my four prisoners. What are you talking about? Nothing, babe, it's just an old Aztec proverb, but I promise I'll explain it to you later. You bet you will. I will, promise. Well, I want a full report on my desk early Friday. I'm working on it. What about your civilian partner, you know, the wrestler? Oh, Aztek? I'd be dead if it wasn't for him, that's for sure. Does he ever take that mask off? I'll explain it in my report. Fair enough. Oh, and, uh, take a couple days off cause you look like shit. I'll take that as a compliment. I missed you. Oh, I did, too. Feeling better, Miss Proctor? I am, thanks to you. You know, you and those other young women, y'all got very lucky today. We sure did, thank you. All right, you take care, okay? - Bye bye. - Thank you, sir. Great guy, good officer. Looks like you two could use a ride home. Man, you're a lifesaver. Can we please do something normal, like eat dinner, because I'm starving! Well, I happen to know this great little place that serves fantastic Mexican food, and it's reasonable. - Really? - Yeah. What's the name of the restaurant? Uh, Guanajuato. It's downtown, great enchiladas, my treat. Really? Do you know what? We'll take you up on it. I always take a dinner, and especially when it's with my girl. We're on. - All right. - You are such a liar! What, I'm just telling the truth, you know. All right. Excuse me, Aztek, can you tell me a little bit about what happened here tonight? Sorry, we have a dinner to go to. - Aztek. - I gotta go eat. I gotta go eat, my woman's hungry, she's hungry. - Aztek. - I gotta go, call me. Call me. Do not call him! Call me.
