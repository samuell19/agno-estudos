[inaudible] [people speaking indistinctly] [ethereal music] [fanfare drum pounding in the background] [door opens] [liquid bubbling] No, you don't. [unintelligible] Just one. Now, can you tell me what this is? -Papier-mâché. -And what is it doing in the back of my cupboard? We were doing at school, so I thought I'd try it at home. [unintelligible] It's not supposed to be like that. I was going to ask mother to help, but she wasn't here. [Mary] Well, she has a lot to do. When men go off to war, it's the women who are responsible for keeping the wheels turning back at home. It's just sometimes... I'll tell you what. When I was a young lass, I had a bit of an interest in stuff like papier-mâché. -Did you? -I did. So would you like to have a go at making -a couple of masks or something, this weekend? -That would be really great. Mary, have you seen Sunday's newspaper? I can't seem to find it anywhere. I'm sorry. I haven't. How many times have I told you not to leave your coat on the chair? Sorry. And no more cookies. You'll spoil your appetite. Mary, you should know better. Hang your coat up properly. And... ...one more thing. Your father has sent you a letter. [grunts] [birds chirping] [glass clinking] [wind blowing] [leaves rustling] [gentle music] [James] Well, Thomas... ...how are things with you? School going well? Mama writes me to say you did well in your exams. That's good. Keep it up. I'm proud of you. It's not so bad here. People sound a little odd. I'm with a great bunch of guys. So things could be worse. With any luck, we'll have this whole business sorted out and be back home before anybody really misses this. [thunder rumbling] [inaudible] [sad music] [James] Oh-oh. I got to go. Your uncle tells me that there's a... ...there's a baseball game going on. They need a pitcher. Look after your mother for me. Keep Mrs. Hickey on her toes. I'll be back soon. I promise. [pen clanking] Write to me when you get the chance. And don't leave your coat laying on chairs when you get in. It drives your mama crazy. All my love, Bubba. [blows] [Mary] You could tell him about the Thanksgiving Day parade. -Done that. -Oh. I'm telling him what great cookies you make. [Mary] Thank you. It's not difficult. Mother can't do it. [Mary] Well, she does other things. Things that I can't do. What sort of things? [Mary] Running the community volunteers. Helping out with the business, organizing the house. But her cooking's is really bad. -[Mary] You're not writing that to your father, are you? -No. I'm telling him when I have the whole set, I'm gonna send him my baseball cards. That's nice. [light gentle music] [snorting] -[groans] -Would you like to see -my card collection, Grandfather? -Hmm? Oh. [clears throat] [sighs, groans] what sort of... cards have you got, hmm? Well, you have a full set. I need one more. Charles has got two of the one I want, but he only wants to swap it for this one. If I can get another one, I'll swap it with a spare, and then I'll have the set. -Oh! -If I get the whole set, I'm gonna send them to Bubba. He'll like to have them. Why didn't we go to the game last weekend? Oh, I'm sorry, Thomas. I... Well, I had to work at the office. Oh, you're always working now. That's only until your pop comes home, then he can take over again. Can we go to the game next week? Absolutely. Promise? Promise. [door opens] [door closes] Did you finish your letter? Not yet. I'll do it tomorrow. Why is Grandpa always tired? He's having to work long hours. It's not easy at his age. Why? Well... it's a difficult time. It's a difficult time for everyone. -Why? -[scoffs] I don't know. It just is. [sighs] You ask so many questions. Good night. Good night. [door opens] [door closes] [slow music] [soldiers screams] [birds chirping] [door opens in distance] [Susan] No. [door closes] [suspenseful music] [moans softly] [muffled conversation] [indistinct conversation] Bubba? [suspenseful music intensifies] [toys clatter] [sobbing] [clock ticking] [door creaks] [door closes] [knocks on door] [crow cawing] Ah. Mr. Toomey. I... ...brought the new lease. [clears throat] [door creaks] I've been... ...meaning to ask you... ...if you would consider making a couple of picture frames for me? I was, uh, wondering if you'd make a trade for a months rent? What do you say, will you take it on? -I will. -Good. Well. That's fine. I... wrote some sizes there for you. When do you think that they might be ready, Mr. Toomey? They'll be ready when they're ready. Uh, thanks, uh, I enjoyed to do business... [door shuts] ...with you, Mr. Toomey. [chuckles] Oh, he's a joy. [gentle music] Mr. Woodman. -I have the bookend you requested. -Oh! Now those... [sighs] ...are a fine piece of work. [children speaking indistinctly] [harmonica playing] [children chattering] [boy] That's brilliant. -[boy 2] Yeah! -[man] Morning, Mr. Toomey. It's my turn. Where are you taking that wood, Mr. Toomey? You're gonna make something with it? -A box. -[boy] Oh! [inaudible] -What are you gonna put in the box, Mr. Gloomy? -[laughter] Inquisitive children. [children laugh] [children] Gloomy Toomey. Gloomy Toomey. -[children giggle] -[children] Gloomy Toomey. Where are we going? I think that getting away from here will be good for us. I don't want to go. I like it here. Well, you'll like it there. It'll be fun. -It won't. -[sighs] It will be nice to see Joan and help out on the farm and... ...have Christmas in the country. Christmas? We're gonna be there for Christmas? [whispers] Only two of us. [horse neighing] [sighs] Without your father, the business can't go on. Your grandfather's too old and I can't. Without that money... ...we have to sell the house. Sell the house? You can't just sell our house. It's my house. What if Papa comes home? Thomas, he... he's not coming home. But he might. [stutters] Suppose he was wounded or... Or captured or something. He wasn't wounded or captured. He is gone. And we have to get on with our lives. Now go to your room and pack the things that you want to take with us. -I don't want to pack-- -No, Thomas. Stop arguing and do as you're told for once. [thuds] [sad music] [sobbing] [sniffles] [fanfare music] -[speaks indistinctly] -Thank you. [man speaks inaudibly] [background chatter] Good luck, Thomas. [background chatter continues] [train horn blowing] [whistle blows] [inaudible] [whistle blowing] [train horn blowing] [dramatic music] [horse snorts] [peaceful music] [birds chirping] [dog barking] Why does Belly sit out here all the time? Oh, he's waiting for Richard to come back. -[dog whimpering] -He always does it. Why don't you take him out? No, it's all right. Go on. Take him out. Explore. But don't get him wet. His coat gets matted, it's a devil to comb out. [gentle music] [birds chirping] Why do we have to come to this stupid place? I hate it here. He is coming back. He is! [screams] You're all wrong. [birds chirping] [dog growling ] No, I'm not gonna play with you. [clicks tongue] Come on. [dog whimpers, barks] [water splashes] [grunts] Come on. Stupid dog. [Susan] She told you not to let him in the water. It's not like she's gonna thank you for it. I didn't let him. He went in by himself. Well, you'll have to make it up to her tomorrow. -How? -[sighs] I don't know. Help out on the farm, feed the chickens, anything. I'm not feeding the chickens. We are not here to live off Aunt Joan's charity. She can't afford it any more than we can. [sighs sharply] [opens door] -Where's my case? -It's there? No, not that one. The little one. In your room? No, I had it at the station. And then... ...I came in with it and... Oh, no! -[puffs] -What? I left it there at the station. We have to go back. -Oh, Thomas, we can't. -But we have to. It's got the Christmas people in it. Christmas people? Papa's Christmas people. [gasps] The Nativity set. We are going to be here for Christmas. We always have them at Christmas. Oh, Thomas. I'm sorry. But... Just have to get a new one. But it won't be the same. -It will. -[Thomas] No, it won't! Nothing's the same. You've got rid of all our things, all our friends. -We've even sold our house. -[sighs] Nothing's ever gonna be the same. -It will in time. I promise you. -Don't promise me anything. Mrs. Hickey promised she'd make masks with me, and she never did. Grandpa was always promising he'd go to the game with me and he didn't! And Bubba promised he was gonna come home, and he isn't. So don't promise me anything! I hate grown-up promises! [door slams] [rooster crows] [clattering] [gentle guitar music] [church bell tolling] [water running] [birds chirping] [inaudible] [horse neighing] [inaudible] [horse snorts] [Celia] Hello. You live at Mrs. Tyler's farm, don't you? How do you know? My Pa told me. What sort of farm is it? Does she have pigs? Chickens. You can't farm chickens. At least, I don't think you can. My name's Celia. What's yours? Thomas. Thomas McDowell. [Edward] Ma and Pa want to go home. -Who are you? -[Celia] Thomas McDowell. Meet my scuzzy brother, Edward. And that one's Bobby Clark. -Where you from? -From the city. -That's your Ma over there? -Yeah. They learn you to read up there in the city? -Yes. -Right? -Of course. -Well, then, I don't suppose our teacher will be able to learn you much. Although from the way she's talking to your Ma, looks like she's going to try. Teach. -What? -Teach you much. -Not learn you much-- -Okay. Shut up, Bobby. [horse whining] [background chatter] [fanfare music] [rooster crows] [dog barks] [chickens hooting and clucking] [thuds] [sighs] Ugh! [thuds] [barks] [bell ringing] [inaudible] [inaudible] -[children laughing] -[teacher clears throat] So how was it? They laughed at my uniform. Oh. We can change that. Some of them asked if I wanted to go play with them one day? Oh, well, that'd be nice. Don't really know them. Did you go to the station? Yes, Thomas, I'm sorry. It's gone. -I knew it. -Don't worry. We'll find a new one. I promise. [bird squawking] [sighs] [Thomas] What are those things sticking out of your basket? [Susan] They are knitting needles. I thought I'd try my hand at knitting us some clothes, now that I've mastered cooking. [plates clanking] [Joan sighs] -[Susan] Thomas. -[puffs] [slow music] [rooster crows] [chickens hooting and clucking] [door creaking] Are you going to feed 'em, Thomas? [chickens clucking] Well, not so wild. The important thing... ...is to gain their trust. Be nice to them. Last thing in the world we want is fretful chickens. They won't lay too many eggs if they're worried. How come we don't have cows? Well... [sighs] ...cows can be a bit of a handful. You have to herd 'em, milk 'em every day. And it's a struggle without your uncle. So I swapped 'em for sheep. Sheep are a lot easier. Do you miss him? [sad music] [metal clanks] Well, like crazy. You never talk about him. I don't. I think it pays to... fret about something I can't change. What shows up on the outside isn't necessarily what's happening on the inside, Thomas. I'm sure you know that, too. Sometimes... I just get really angry inside. I look at other men. I wish it was them that were dead. Not Bubba. That's what I feel. But I see men who haven't gone to fight. I guess it's natural. We're all the same. [chickens clucking] [cow moos] -[Mr. Woodman] Ms. McDowell, isn't it? -Mm-hmm. What can I get for you today? Do would like the bookends? They certainly are a fine piece of work. Yeah. A local man makes them. Trades me pieces for supplies. Good craftsman. Kind of a loner, though. Kids call him "Gloomy." [playful music] [object clatters] [children laughing] [object clatters] [children laughing] How come your father didn't go to war? His eyes aren't that good. If they gave him a gun, he'd probably be more dangerous to us than the enemy. You're lucky. I know. [Edward] Hey, Thomas McDowell, let's see what you could do with this. Show him, Bobby. Yeah. See? Nothing to it. -[grunts] -[laughs] [breathless] You know, for a townie, you're really dumb. [laughs] -Edward! -What? -You knew what I was gonna do. -[Celia] I did not! I thought you had grown out of all that. You're really childish sometimes, Edward. Are you all right, Thomas? [Edward] It's only a bit of fun. [calm music] [Joan] I think his name is Toomey. He lives in a house he leases off Jim Hardwick. Edwards says he's a kidnapper. He said what? He said the man had told him that he made boxes to put children in. Edward thinks he's probably been in prison or something. [Joan] That boy's got too much imagination. I don't think so. He works in wood. Hmm. I think I saw his stuff at the store. It's good. -He's scary. -[Joan] No, he's not. A bit dour, maybe, but not scary. What's dour? Unfriendly. -This is good, Susan. -Thank you. You are definitely getting the hang of it. [Susan laughs] Thank you, Joan. [suspenseful music] [Celia whispering] Do you think he's in there? I think I saw him going. [whispering] Well, I saw him in town. [Celia] No. He's definitely in there. You don't have to do this, Thomas. [whispering] He does, if he wants to hang out with us. We all did. What do you mean we all? -You never did it. -I did it. I've done it lots of times. You want to do this or you gonna [unintelligible]? -I'll do it. -Good. All right. I'll make it easy for you. You don't have to bang on the door. Just... go right up to the house and bring me back something to prove you were there. [frog croaking] [crow caws] [wood creaking] [suspenseful music swells] [[crow caws] -He can do it. -Do you think he's got lucky? [sighs] [mouthing inaudibly] [children speak inaudible] [door creaks] [suspenseful music intensifies] What do you want? What do you want? [door opens, closes] [steps going upstairs] Thomas! Thomas! Are you feeling unwell? I'm fine. Are you sure? Positive. [Susan] I've had an idea about our Nativity set. You know the man you saw at the stream? That carpenter fellow. -What was his name? Tomey or something? -Toomey. That's it. Well, seeing as how Joan thought he was so good, I thought we could ask him to carve us a replacement set. We could go and see him tomorrow. What do you think? [tense music] [playful music] Come along, Thomas. Come along. [chuckles] What are you doing back there? [knocks on door] Uh, I'm sorry to bother you, uh, Mr. Toomey? What do you want? My name is Susan McDowell. This is my son, Thomas. We're staying with my sister, -Mrs. Tyler. -What do you want? -May we come in? -No. Well, uh, in that case, I was wondering if you might help us with the problem we have. You see, we recently lost something. A Nativity set. It was a carved one. It was very special to us. And... [sighs] I was hoping that by some miracle it might be returned, but-- Miracles are pishposh. [scoffs] You're probably right. Anyway... [sighs] I want to replace it. And I was wondering if you might consider carving us a new one. No. I'm too busy. And I don't work for people that lack respect for others. [crow cawing] What did he mean by that? Thomas. Thomas? I was gonna bang on his door and run away. -Kind of a dare. -A dare? I won't do anything bad. Ugh! I am so sorry, Mr. Toomey. I apologize for whatever my son has done to upset you. He's not a bad boy, but like all boys, he can at times behave a little bit... like a boy and... [sighs] I'm sorry to have bothered you. Come on. [Mr. Toomey] How many pieces? Uh, I'd be happy to pay for the commission. [Mr. Toomey] How many pieces? Two sheep, a cow, the angel, uh, the three Wise Men, Joseph and Mary with the baby Jesus. Please, Mr. Toomey, it's very important to us. [door opens] Will you take the job? -Fifty cents a piece. -Thank you. No need to thank me. That's what I do. Of course. Mr. Toomey, one more thing. Do you think there's any chance that the figures will be ready by Christmas Day? Christmas? They'll be ready when they're ready. [door creaks] [sighs] Well, that went well, I think. Oh. If he eats it, he might not take the job. [fanfare music] [birds chirping] [fanfare music swells] [geese quack] [children laughing] [indistinct chatter] [child exclaims] You want to play? I've only got one card, and I'm not gonna lose it. Suit yourself. You didn't have to be so nasty to Mr. Toomey. What's it to you? I don't think he seemed so bad. It may come as a big surprise to you, McDowell. We don't actually care what you think. If we want to have a bit of fun with Gloomy, then we will. Now, you wanna talk... ...or play? Mr. Toomey. [crow cawing] Mr. Toomey. [whispering] You really are the most difficult man I've ever met. What do you want? I just wished to know if you'd made a start on our Nativity set. No. But I will. [Susan] Well, I was wondering if Thomas could come and watch you work? -No. -He wouldn't disturb you. I like quiet to do my work. I'll make sure he respected your rules. Why are you asking me this? He-- he's always been a creative child and... ...he used to take such an interest in making things. This past month has been very difficult for him, and I would encourage anything that would rekindle his interests. I'm not a childminder. -I'd come with him. -Yeah. I don't like fidgets. He'd sit still. I will work on the carvings one hour each evening. Bring the boy at five o'clock. Thank you. You don't need to thank me. Whether you're there or not, makes no difference to me whatsoever. [calm music] [scraping] [instruments clatter] [Susan] Thomas! Just be quiet. Yes, mother. And no fidgeting. He says he doesn't like fidgets. I know, mother. -I mean it. -Yes, mother. [Susan] And you're lucky, he's even allowing us to be there. -I'm not sure I want to be there. -[sighs] That's not the point. Come on, we'll be late. Yes, mother. [water running] [knocks on door] Come. [door latch clatters] [chuckles] [sighs nervously] You have a-- a very nice house, Mr. Toomey. I don't like distractions. I don't like conversation. No fidgeting, no jiggling, no noise. Not that chair. The other one. [sighs] No one sits in that chair. [clears throat] [scraping wood] [rattling] [inhales deeply] [stops rattling] [resumes scraping wood] [light thuds] [crow caws] [needles rattling] [sighs] [popping] [instrument clatters] [sighs deeply] [resumes scraping wood] Mr. Toomey. Excuse me. Mr. Toomey. May I ask you a question? [sighing] If you must. Is that... one of my sheep you're carving? And who else's sheep would it be? [scraping wood] Mr. Toomey. Excuse me, but... ...well... ...you're carving my sheep... ...wrong. It is a very nice sheep, Mr. Toomey. -Nice? -Very nice. But? Well... -It doesn't look-- -It doesn't look what? Happy. Happy? Happy? Pishposh! It's a sheep! Cheaper sheep. They're not supposed to look happy. My sheep were happy. [Mr. Toomey] Why? What do they have to be happy about? They knew they are with the baby Jesus. [sighs] Think it's time for us to be going now. Um... Thank you very much, Mr. Toomey, for letting us come to visit you. I hope we may come again. Uh... I made this [unintelligible] bread. Here. I'll leave it here. I hope you like it. Come on. [door opens] [door closes] [animal howling] [sighs deeply] Did you say your prayers? I don't have anything to pray for. And you could pray that you don't make Mr. Toomey any more upset. He doesn't seem like the kind of man who takes too kindly to instructions. I didn't tell him what to do. I only said that my sheep were happy. [yawns] I think he pretends to be more grumpy than he is. [Susan] Well, in that case, let's keep it that way, shall we? [wind whooshing] [sighs] -Why not? -Because I don't think he's been to prison. That's why not. Thomas says he's nice. Thomas says he's nice. I say he's not. I say... we go around the back of the house... ...wait till he's gone and find the evidence. What evidence? I don't know. Um... Evidence. There must be something. Where did he come from? Why hasn't he got any friends o-- or a family? How are we gonna get in? [cow mooing] What's that? It's a key. I know that. What sort of key? It's the key to his front door. Where did you get it? Pa's key ring. It's our house. We own it. Gloomy just rents it. [Mr. Spencer] Hey, fellas. [all in unison] Hi, Mr. Spencer. Next week, sometime. After school. What's happening next week? -What's that? -[Edward] Oh, it's, it's nothing. Nothing. We're just, um, going somewhere with my dad. -Can I come? -No, sorry. I gotta go. Come on. [gentle music] What are you doing with that bottle? Making cheese. -What? -You put some milk in a bottle, and you leave it there for a while, and it turns into cheese. You have to keep turning, otherwise it doesn't work. You want to go? Yeah. -Like that? -Sure. [Thomas] How long before it turns into cheese? I don't know [chuckling] Why not? It never has. [crow cawing] [scraping wood] [fire creaking] [Thomas hiccups] [continues to hiccup] [inhales sharply] [scraping wood continues] [exhales] [hiccups] -[Thomas] Mr. Toomey, excuse me. -Hmm? Is that my cow that your carving? Yes. Oh. Why do you ask? Oh, no reason. It's a very nice cow, Mr. Toomey. It's just... ...it doesn't look like my cow. [sighing] Well... ...all carvings are different. But my cow looked... ...well, what kind of... ...kind of proud. Proud? Pishposh. Cows are cows. They cannot look proud. My cow did. It knew Jesus had chosen to be born in it's barn. So it felt proud. Well, this isn't a real cow. This is a carving. And carvings are made of wood. Carvings don't have feelings. My cow did.

Oh, nothing, Mr. Toomey. Good. Except... -Yes? -Well... ...it's just... Yes? Well, my angel... ...the original one... ...looked really kind of... ...sort of... ...important. Important? Pishposh. Of course, it's important. It's an angel. How am I supposed to make it look more important? I don't know, Mr. Toomey. -But I'm sure you will. -Hmm. You did it with the sheep and the cow. -Mr. Toomey. Excuse me, but-- -[exhales sharply] Has no one ever talked to you about the value of silence? -My mother. -And what did she say? She said she'd hope I would learn it from you. [clicks tongue] What? -Can I carve something? -No. -Why not? -Because you'll probably cut yourself. I'll be really careful. Last words of many famous men. I will though. And because I'm not a teacher. Oh, you needn't teach me. I'll just... -...figure it out for myself. -And there's only room enough for one carver at this bench. Oh. [scraping wood] [sighs] [clicks tongue] Here. What shall I carve? [Mr. Toomey] Oh, well, a bird. What sort of bird? Hmm. A robin. I like robins. All right. [clears throat] [Mr. Toomey] This knife is very sharp, so I want you to be careful. I will be. Up. Here. Your thumb, lock it in with your forefinger. Always cut away from your body. That way, you won't stab yourself. [Thomas] I won't. That's it. Just keep narrowing that in like you're sharpening a pencil. See, that's where you want the head and the beak. [mutters] Mr. Toomey. Yes, Thomas. When will the carvings be ready? They'll be ready... [sighs] ...when they're ready. [scraping wood] [church bell tolls] It's time for us to go now, Thomas. Thank you, Mr. Toomey. Thomas, take these home with you. And practice more. It may help you learn the value of silence. Go on. Thank you for the stool, Mr. Toomey. -[Mr. Toomey] Hmm. -It's really nice. [door opens, closes] [gentle music] -[Thomas] That was nice of him, wasn't it? -[Susan] Yes, it was. [Thomas] When I've fed the chickens, I'm going to do some more carving. -[Susan] Not too late. -[Thomas] I don't think he's [unintelligible] I really don't understand that stuff about the value of silence.

[sniffles] I woke up very early. It was summer and everything was warm and still. And I could hear this bird calling. And I just lay there and listened to it. And then I woke your father... ...and I told him that it was time for you to be born. And he looked at me... [inhales] ...and he said that no matter what happened... [exhales] ...this would always be the best day of his life. And you know what? It was mine, too. He was a wonderful man. He was kind and he was strong. He looked after us.

I am not a jibber. I just don't think it's right. Well, It looks like it's just you and me then, huh? She'd only get in the way anyhow. -I'm not going either. -What? -Not going! -Why? Fundamentally, I believe it constitutes a contravention -of the individual's right to privacy. -What? [inaudible] [laughs] [people chattering] Where is Edward? Gone off in a temper. What about? Oh, nothing. Tell me. I don't want to tell you. [scoffs] Why not? Where's he gone? He's gone to Mr. Toomey's house, to... look for evidence. Evidence? -Evidence of what? -I don't know. Just evidence, he said. [dog barks] How's he gonna get in? He took a key off Pa's ring. We've got to stop him. Tell my mother I'll see her at Mr. Toomey's house. [dramatic music] [bird squawking] [dramatic music intensifies] Edward! -What are you doing? -What's it to you? You can't just break into somebody's house. Not somebody's. My family's. That's none of your business. That Toomey is hiding something. And I'm going to find out what it is. You leave him alone, Edward. [tense music] Or what? What's he gotta do with you anyway, huh? How come you like him so much? You want him to marry your Ma or something like that, McDowell? Is that it? You're looking for a new Pa? And you think that gloomy man's him. [punches] Lucky I got him off you when I did. Shut up, Bobby. [birds chirping] Well, Thomas, what have you been doing? -Had an argument with someone. -An argument? [gentle music] More like a fight, I suppose. Hmm. Getting in fights a lot? Sometimes you have to. No, nobody has to fight, they just fight because they like to fight. Sometimes even people who don't like fighting have to. When's that? Well... when it's right. I don't know. I'm ten years old. Only had one real fight. You're a grown-up. You must know. Grown-ups don't know anything. [bird squawking] [knocks on the door] [Susan] Mr. Toomey. Mr. Toomey. [clock ticking] [sad gentle music] [exclaims] [crow cawing] -[Thomas] What are you gonna carve today? -[Mr. Toomey] Today? Today, I start on Mary and the Baby Jesus. You want to tell me what they should look like before I go making any mistakes? [Thomas] That's easy, Mr. Toomey. They just loved each other more than anything else in the world. That's helping a little? [door latch clanks] You had no right. Uh... I was looking for a vase for the holly. I thought it'd look pretty on the table. I'm so sorry. I'm meant no harm. No right at all. [objects clattering] [wind whooshing] [birds cawing] We made him very angry today, didn't we? No, Thomas. I did. It's not your fault. [chuckles] It's not gonna be the same this Christmas, is it? I don't know. I'll say a prayer. That's a very good idea. [birds chirping] [owl hooting] I've come to apologize. And to ask you not to punish Thomas for my mistake. You have no need to. I feel that I do. Whoever you are and... whatever has happened to you, you have a right to your privacy, and I had no right to intrude upon it. Merry Christmas, Mr. Toomey. I want no presents. Christmas is pishposh. Not to us, Mr. Toomey. To us, Christmas is very special. [gentle music] [chickens clucking] [dog barking] [birds chirping] Do you think he'll finish it? I don't know. [unintelligible] will take a miracle. I don't think Mr. Toomey believes in miracles. [owl hooting] [sighs] [wind whooshing] [baby cooing] [sad music] [baby cooing] [gentle music] [Thomas] They just loved each other more than anything else in the world. [gentle music swells] [inspirational music] [bird squeals] [bird squawking] [gentle music] [rooster crows] [Susan whispers] Thomas. Wake up. [gentle music swells] [church bell tolls] [people chattering] [inaudible] [Christmas music] [children laughing] [muted] [laughter] [inaudible] Did you make those? [inaudible chattering] [Christmas music continues] [inaudible] [inaudible] [gentle music] They really are nice, Mr. Toomey. Thank you. Oh, you're welcome, Thomas. Mr. Toomey. Yes. [Thomas] May I ask you a question? [Mr. Toomey] If you must. [Thomas] Do you think Christmas is pishposh? [Mr. Toomey] No, I don't, Thomas. I don't think Christmas is pishposh. I think Christmas is... ...very special. -[Thomas] Mr. Toomey. -[Mr. Toomey] Yes? [Thomas] What does pishposh mean?
