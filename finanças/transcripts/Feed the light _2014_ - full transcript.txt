If you want to see what I see look towards the light. It's like a hypnosis of sorts. Just relax. And look. Don't be afraid. Let it enter your head. You're retarded, everybody knows that now. Let me go! - You can't take her! - I can't hear you, you fucking retard! - Where is she? - You think I'm dumb enough to tell? - You can't take her! - I can't hear you, you fucking retard! Fucking cunt. I'll come for her. - Are you here for the position? - Yes... That's why I'm here, for the position. Sit down. Take your cap off. Are you carrying a cell phone? - Why do you ask? - They interfere with our equipment. And are strictly prohibited In our establishment. I don't have a cell phone. Name and personal identity number? Stop scratching! - And there we've got the cell phone. - I'm sorry... I was positive I had left it at home. - Why are you lying to me? - I'm not. Believe it or not, I will offer this job to you. But let there be no doubt concerning the fact that we'll be watching you. Are you going to be a problem for us? Well? Well? Look at me! Look at me! I told you to look at me. I want to hear you say that you won't be a problem for us. I won't be a problem for you... I'm just here to work. Good. The cell phone? Welcome. In the changing room you can go and find a fitting overall. Ask for HÃ¥kan in the corridor to the left, he'll inform you further. We've got a new employee. I don't think she's here to work. I want you to find out what she's up to. And then, I want you to take care of it. You're not wearing any eye protection. You have 10 get protection, for your eyes. Don't you see the danger in walking around like that? Get some sort of protection, for your eyes. OK. Thanks for the tip. I'll get eye protection. Soon you will see the light, and then you'll know what I mean! Now can you leave me alone? You idiot! You don't give a shit about what I'm saying! I can tell! You're just like the rest, who don't give a shit about what I'm saying! But soon you'll get what I mean, and then it'll be too late! He's watching all of us, just like that fucking janitor. - That asshole. - I'd snap his neck. Sara Hansson. You'll be cleaning here from now on. Here's some assistance. Can you show her what to do? - Yeah, I'll show her. - Just don't go dozing off now. As you've understood, you'll be sweeping. Sounds pretty simple, right? It's important that you get rid of all of this sparkling dust. - What sparkling dust? - You can't see it, but it's there. Under each and every light. Attracting the vermin, there to eat the dust. What are you doing here? Answer me! What are you doing here! - Cleaning... - Don't lie to me, you moron. Why the hell have you got a knife in your pocket? - Tell me what you're here for! - My daughter! My daughter Jenny! She's here! What the hell are you talking about? There are no children here. Her dad brought her here! They're here, somewhere. - I have to find her! - Lie and I'll break your arm! Wait! Look! - Get rid of the dirt. - You missed a spot. - Scrub harder. - Can't you give me a hand instead? We can call your mom and ask her to give you a hand. It wasn't my fault! I can't help it, it won't come off! -Keep scrubbing! Poor you. If you can't help it, then how the hell could we? - Keep scrubbing! - It's not our fault. That's what happens when you don't do your job. - It's your problem, not ours. - We warned you. It's on me! Help me, it's on me! You can't just leave! Are you okay? What happened? Look! I've seen it before. What is it? You have to understand that it's dangerous here. You lost your shit back there, I want you to take it. Take it! Take it. Sorry about earlier, I thought you were here to sabotage. But... I think I can help you find your kid, if you want. - Why would you want to help me? - Do you want help or not? If so, I might know someone who can help. You're going to meet VHS. We call him that after the old tapes. He's been here for a long time, filming. Documenting. Crawled around in every damn nook there is around here. But now... He just sits in his corner, to the use of no one. Then how is he of any use to me? - How is he of any use to me? - You'll see, once you've met him. What's that? What is that? Floor 3. Consider yourself lucky not to know what that is. That way you don't have to care. This way. Just turn at the end of the corridor. All the way down. - Why aren't you coming? - Because I don't want to. I hate that piece of scum. What are you doing here? Jon? What happened to you? What happened to your face? - You look older. - It's something to do with the light. I don't even know how long I've been here. - What? I saw you last Monday. - No. What? Last Monday you sat in court grinning like a damn monkey. What happened? - The light changes time... - Shut up! No more of your bullshit! Where's Jenny? Jon! Where's Jenny? What have you done with our child? I lost her. But I know she's here, somewhere. - I should have won custody. - It doesn't matter. - You'll never get out of here. - You idiot! How could you lose her? - You're supposed to take care of her! - I thought I was doing something good! - That's what the light said! - How could you bring her here? Is this a place for a child? There's something in the light. Something that's... dangerous. It's dangerous, Sara. I don't know what's going on here, but pull yourself together! Now! - Pull yourself together, and tell me! - Calm down! Calm down... Calm down. I'll show you. - Where was this filmed? - On the second floor. - That's the first basement. - Al right. How do I get there? - You don't. - What do you mean? - You're the janitor, you have keys. - This might be hard to explain... Some doors only open with cell phones around here. That's why the boss doesn't want you to have one. They don't interfere with any equipment. Nothing does. It's to keep you out of where you're not supposed to be. Finding a cell phone IS No easy task. I know where to find one. Hurry up, before the boss gets here. How come you don't have a family? What kind of moronic question is that? Of course I have one. - And where are they? - None of your business! They're gone, al right? And that's what will happen to you if you don't hurry and find your kid. I've been looking for you. I've done some digging. She has a child. The child's father works here. - Guess who. - Who? Jon. The VHS-man? He once told me he's got sole custody of his child. How does a mother lose custody of her own child? Any ideas? Keep an eye on them. If there's a problem, just send her to the second floor. You're going to Kill him! That's enough! That's enough! - I think you killed him. - What the hell was I supposed to do? Are you okay? Yeah. You said they open doors. Show me. You're not cleaning. If the dirt attracts vermin, it'll be your problem. Funny, how you don't seem to understand. We're resting. Saving our energy. The boss will find out. Hand over those damn cables. Connect the cell phone. Where's the door? The one we're supposed to open. - Where is it? - Right here. Need this as well? You open doors here in the light using cell phones. Pretty much just like you would imagine it. Got any more? We open doors using phones. They're in the light. Just imagine how... you switch TV channels with a remote. That's what we're doing here. Be careful, Sara. Think of the light as if... As if it were a fireplace. At night. Insects attracted to the flames. - What insects? - It's hard to explain. Enough. Let's show her instead. Don't touch me! If it weren't for you I wouldn't be here. - What do you want me to say? - Nothing. Just help make it right. Set the light to the pulse. Look... Look. I don't get it. Pay attention to the small details. To the tiny, little changes. - I don't get what I'm supposed to... - Patience. Look. Once you've cracked the code, you know what to do. - There! - No! It's not Jenny. It's not her. It's just a trick. An attempt. Like a bait, for you to go there. Turn around, very carefully, and look behind you. Carefully. It's her asthma. - How are you doing, Sara? - What was that black thing? Just like how we can open doors to places in this building, other doors can be opened, to completely different places. He's speaking of the vermin. The insects, attracted to the dirt. That's why we clean around here. Tell her about Tommy. When I first started here I had a colleague called Tommy. We were going to make a documentary about the light. Show the world what we had seen. God... We had seen God. It does something to your head. Crawls into your skull. Tommy turned strange. He went deeper and deeper on the second floor. And then he just disappeared. I had no idea how the light influenced time down there. What happened to him? Martin found him. He'd hanged himself. He had aged. Looked 70, 80 years old. If you're unlucky, you can age years in just a few hours. So do you still want to keep going? Can we prepare you better this time? The air is full of dirt in the light so never take this mask off. Don't touch anything, even though you've got gloves. I'm only there to get Jenny. I know. I just want you to be careful. For fuck's sake, come on. Time is running out. This is the most important part. You'll need that to find your way around. - How does it help me? - It's kind of like fishing. You toss out the string, but you're the bait. - To be reeled in. - Who's reeling me in? Remember, the second you find her you drop the string. Then you get her, and you run back. - What the hell are you doing? - It needs the scent of humans. Once you're in there, toss the roll but keep one end. Then you'll be pulled away. Hold on tight. Don't let go of the string. It's your only chance to find the way. Ready? What did you do that for? We had things to tell her. And how were you planning on telling her? The less she knows, the better. She'll never make it now. -Hello? Can you hear me? -Hurry, before the boss comes. I've got one! I've got one! I've got one! Sara? What are you doing? Are you there? There's something here. Something, just around the corner. Did it see you? Good. Don't let it see you. Keep away. - Do not let go of the string. - Come back, let's call it off. Come back, now. Please. Calm your breathing, Sara. Sara, you're hyperventilating. Take deep, calm breaths. Fuck... - Go in there and get her. - You do it. Can't you see who's holding the connection? - I'm never going back in there. - You coward... I'm back. I've got the string. Why are you helping her? Mind your own business. You've never helped anyone in your entire life. Why her? She's got more balls than anyone else in here. She came here alone to find her kid. You're thinking of your family out there, aren't you? Did you hear that? - Hear what? - The boss is coming. - You're staying here! - Never. She's going to kill us. You're good for absolutely nothing. What are you doing? Something's wrong. The light can't be controlled. One of the cleaners disappeared into it. You shouldn't be doing this, it's dangerous. You know I care about you. What would I do without you? Here's what's going to happen: You stop this, and I call a meeting. It's time to get organized here. - Just five minutes, I'm almost done. - I want you to stop this, now. We've got more important business to attend. So your suggestion is to leave it like this... - Martin! - ...So that more people can disappear? It can wait. Give it a rest and meet me in the office. Sara, can you hear me? Tommy Jonsson, take 32. There's something with this light. It does something to your head. It has done something to my eyes, because I can't see the doors. I feel them but I'm afraid to enter, afraid I won't find my way back. It's like a hypnosis of sorts. Something with your head. Strangely enough I'm neither hungry nor tired. It just goes on and on... The thing is, this light is stuck. Trapped, just like we are. I drew this on my computer. All the lamps in the building are connected to the container. Like a battery. That's why things are the way they are. Someone must release the light. - Mom. - Jenny! I never stopped thinking of you. Wishing you were safe. Wanting to be with you. I'll take care of you now. Come with me. You have got to hold my hand. And now we sneak out... Carefully, along the wall. And we have 10 be really quiet. - Stay here! - What is it? Keep still. How the hell did you just appear? It won't open! Open the door! It won't open! It's already open. Sara Hansson. - I want a word with you in my office. - Please let us out of here. - We just want to leave. - There are more pressing matters. - What? - In my office. Now. Jenny, you have to wait out here. I just need to speak with her, so she'll let us out. I don't want to. - Sorry? - I don't want to. I'll be back. Mommy, I don't want you to go. There's something in there that I don't want you to see. No, stop! Let go! Listen to mommy! Enough! We didn't do anything! You have lied. Broken into my office. You have stolen my personal property. On the floor in front of you I found the body of a strangled man. - Strangled, slowly, to death. - It wasn't me! It was the janitor! What is it that you're up to? You're helping her, but you don't seem to have a motive. - Have you fallen for her? - I'm sick of your jealousy. The light must be locked up and it's we, out of hundreds of thousands - who have gotten this mission. - I don't give a shit. - Find some other idiot. - She's about to do something terrible. And when that happens, I want you to remember what I said. He was like a child. And you killed him. It was an accident, he attacked me! He bit me! And getting the janitor to fall for you. No, he hasn't! He's just helping me, because he cares about people. No he doesn't. He's just fooling you. His job is, and has always been, to take care of this warehouse. - He's got everything to lose... - You're lying! You know nothing! About him, about me! Nothing about what it's like to lose a child! If you were in my shoes, what would have happened? If I had killed your child? Then you would've understood. That's what we have to do. Your child has to die. You're retarded, everybody knows that now. Mommy, why are you acting so strange? What the hell have you done? I had to! She was going to kill Jenny. - What is happening? - The boss is dead, what do you think? You've ruined all your chances of ever getting out of here! What do you mean? There's nobody to control this light any longer. Where's Jenny? Jenny! - Where is she? - Don't touch me! - Where is she! - They've taken her! - Who? - I tried to help you, but for what? - I'm not leaving her! - You'll never find her. I can't leave her. Fine. Have it your way. It's time to get this place organized. What is this? Martin! You've really disappointed me. I trusted you. I liked you, Sara. But instead, you stab the boss. - Leaving me responsible for chaos! - Take my hood off! I can't breathe! Stand still and you'll get your damn inhaler. Please, take this thing off. You don't want to see what's down there. It's better if it stays on. Martin! Don't leave! Don't leave me here! - Hello? - Sara, Sara... Find a big, metallic container, and release the light from it. I can't see anything. It's so bright. - You have to shield your eyes. - What the hell are you doing? When you find it, open it and release the light. Who are you talking to? You son of a bitch! Do you understand what would happen if she sets it free? Damn you! - The boss is gone. - No one left to hide behind. I know the boss is dead. - Why else would there be so much dirt? - Because you never help out. Because I don't help out? Do your damn job! - Oh, but we will. - Get rid of the biggest pile of dirt. You can't touch me, you know nothing about this place. Nothing! You'll drop like flies, one by one. You scum. What the hell! You'll burn! You bastard! Fucking scum! Grab a brick! Help out! What are you doing? You're crazy! Do not open the lid. If you do, you'll ruin everything. Don't be afraid. Who's there? It's me, mommy. You look just the way I remember. What has happened? I know it sounds odd, but time is different here. I love you. I love you, mom. I'm sorry. Mom, it's al right. I'm so sorry, Jenny.
