[breeze blowing faintly] [branches creaking] [bird screeching faintly] DRIVER: But there was something strange though, because a few months later, we were looking through our wedding photographs and there was a picture of myself and my wife at the front of the hotel. And you could see just behind us, a figure of someone looking out of the window. Staring at us. Really quite scary at the time. -Nobody you could account for? -Absolutely nobody. -Oh, my goodness. -And it turns out the room -was empty at the time. -[gasps] DRIVER: So, I, uh... I avoid the place on dark winter nights. [chuckles] [bell tolling] Mum, we're here. We've arrived. [dog panting] [quick sigh] [computer keyboard clicking] WOMAN: Good evening. We'd like to check in please. Yeah, no problem. -Uh, do you have a reservation? -Yes. -Great. What's the name? -Hart. Hart. [turning pages] RECEPTIONIST: mm. When did you book? I was gonna say that I... made the reservation um, several months ago. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I understand that. I'm just-- I'm just looking. Just... [sighs] -Several months ago you said? -Yeah. -But I did ring last week... -You did ring? -Okay. -...to double check. -Ah, here you go. -Yes. -Uh, Julie Hart, ground floor. -That's right. -No. Well, no, uh... -With wheelchair access. In fact, when I rang last week it was to confirm that what we-- what we've reserved is the first floor, uh, facing the formal gardens. Uh, no. There's nothing here on my side. Usually when people book and they have a special request -it's attached to the booking. -Uh-huh. Yes. Well, I imagine he would have made a note of it. Can you check with your colleague maybe? He's not here this evening. Or, maybe even your manager. -It's just me for tonight. -[typing] But we're here tonight and I reserved it. Yeah, I get that. So, would you be happy to stay on the ground floor just for tonight? No, I'm afraid not, because I reserved a first floor room. Well I can't put you in a room that I haven't got. [continues typing] A lot of keys there. Just one moment, please. I mean... I have one room that I can give you just for tonight. -Oh. -That is on the first floor. JULIE: Oh. Oh, that's very good. Um... Well, maybe could I see that room? Yeah, you wanna see the room? -Yes. Just check it out. -I'll take you up. And there's Wi-Fi throughout the hotel, is there? Uh, no, not throughout the hotel. If you want some signal, best off going to the top of the building. JULIE: I'm sorry, I didn't understand. Did you say that there was Wi-Fi on this floor? RECEPTIONIST: I mean, there is Wi-Fi in the building, but you only get signal when you go up to the top. JULIE: I did reserve a table in the restaurant for dinner. RECEPTIONIST: h, no, you were late so everything's closed. -And here's your key. Thanks. -Thank you. And as soon as possible it would be good to know that we can be here for the remaining nights. [door shuts] Oh, God! Getting our things in a little bit of a muddle here. Just get it all. Here we are. Oops. Now, no peeking. [laughs] No, I'm not looking. I'm not looking. [drawer shuts] Darling, don't you want to take your coat off? You must be boiling. I just want to get everything organized. MOTHER: Oh, it's so good to be here. I remember the ceiling. [Julie zips luggage] And I think, uh, I was in that bed. My sister was in this one. Look... Oh, darling. Oh, no! [chuckles] Oh, my Lord... [muffled techno music thumping] [music intensifies] RECEPTIONIST: h, shit. -[thumping music fades] -[car revving] [clock ticking faintly] [dog whimpering] [dog panting] -[wind moaning] -[light creak] -[dog whimpers] -Come on. [dog barking] [gravel crunching underfoot] [wind moaning softly] All right, Mum. So, I'll see if I can find a kettle. -All right? -All right, darling. Louis, you stay here. Stay with your mistress. I won't be long. [water dripping] [appliance clunks, whirring] Aren't you a good boy? Yes. [faint creaking] [hinges creaking] [faint creaking] [sighs] [wind moaning outside] [light creaking] (ETHEREAL VOICE HUMMING SIMPLE MELODY) [receptionist humming] [mouse clicking] [creaking] [wind blowing] -Good morning. -Good morning. -Just one or two things. -Yeah? I'm wondering if there's any clarity on whether or not we can stay in our room for the next few nights. Um, I still don't know about the room. Oh, there's no way of expediting that decision is there? Uh, no. I can try and get back to you later on today, but I can't promise anything. Sooner rather than later would be much appreciated. Yep. Also, we don't seem to have a kettle in our room. -An electric kettle, please. -Yep, I'll bring one up. And, also, I had a very unsettled night. There was a sound. I'm sure other people have mentioned it to you. A banging of some kind. I imagine it was a window or... Yeah. I mean, there's no one staying above you. Well, exactly. I can't imagine anybody would have been staying in a room with that because they wouldn't have been able to sleep at all. It was... And I don't know if it was a window, but it felt repetitive and... Yeah, all night. That's strange, 'cause nobody else has mentioned anything at all about any noise whatsoever. -Really? -Yeah. That does surprise me. It was pervasive. Oh, well, anyway, um... I would be very grateful if you could make sure that doesn't happen again tonight, and check all the windows and... All the windows? Well, all the windows-- Especially in the rooms that are not occupied, because, obviously, the people who are staying in the rooms will be able to check their own windows. Yep. I also have a message for you, by the way. Your cousin... Alistair. He wants you to go to lunch with him on Sunday. Oh, thank you very much. So, lovely to hear that we can stay in our room. The checking of the windows... ...and, uh, and the kettle. -Yeah, I'll bring the kettle up. -Thank you. -No problem. -Thank you. We don't want to go do we? Just tell me, what would you prefer? Well, what do you feel? No, Mum. I want us to do what you want. Oh, well I feel so awful to say it, but... It's not that I don't want to see them, but I mean, we're so cozy here, aren't we? Yeah, I mean it's very selfish, but I was rather hoping... ...we could be together. If you can think of a nice way of saying it, I think it would be really wonderful -if we could just be us. -Very good. I'll call him later. I think that would be... I think that would be the best. You having a nice breakfast? Very, very good marmalade. So I'm gonna go and make a start on my work. Are you all right? I'm perfectly fine, thank you, darling. I'm just gonna take my time and then I'm gonna have a bath. Do you want me to run it for you? -Mm. -Really? No, don't worry. I'll be fine. You found a nice place to work? Yeah, yeah, I think so. I'm gonna give it a stab anyway. RECEPTIONIST: It's not a problem... I'm just... in the middle of something. Yeah. [pencil scratching] [door creaks, thuds] [wind blowing outside] [faint moaning] Mum? Mum? [hotel creaking] I got you a nice glass of wine. MOTHER: Thank you very much. Oh, goodness me. Are we early or late? I mean... Are we the only people staying here? Have you worked that out yet? I know... I don't know. I... There was no-one here when I arrived. Oh, look at that. Thank you very much. That's very welcome. Are you ready to order? Oh, I do apologize. Haven't even had a look. Uh, not quite, I just, uh... gosh. Shall I come back in a couple of minutes or... JULIE: That would be kind. RECEPTIONIST: 'll come back in a couple of minutes. Thank you. Ooh... Nice looking things. What do you think, Mum? What do you think? I'm, um... I'm a bit torn between the soup... A carrot and coriander soup, and the beetroot salad sounds very nice. Yeah, "Salad of heritage beetroot, apple and Welsh feta." Such... So nice when it's local. I mean, I suppose we could have... ...different things on different nights. RECEPTIONIST: Have you decided? There's only four options. I think I'll have the, um... Yeah, I think I'll have the beetroot salad to start. -And then, uh... -A main? Yes and then followed by the salmon. -[pen scribbling] -Yeah. MOTHER: And I'll have the same, please. The beetroot salad... ...and the salmon. -I'll bring it over. -JULIE: Thank you. [camera whirs] MOTHER: Darling, will you stop doing that? You must, must have enough photographs of me by now. -JULIE: Well, I gotcha. -[sighs] So there. [flatware clinking] What's in that bag, Mum? Oh, just... ...things to go through. Letters and, um... and papers and photographs and, uh... Maybe there's... stuff in it that... that I would... ...value... that maybe you wouldn't. Well, I'm sure you're very interested. I can... I can sense your interest. I'm sure you think you're going to want to put it in a film at some point. Let's just have a nice dinner. -[bell tolling] -Do you remember this room? Yes, this was-- this was the drawing room. And, uh... big, big sofas here. Velvet ones. Yeah. And us children would jump off the back of it. We would jump from one to the other. See if we could make it. Over a dog preferably. Mm... Did you have a good day, darling? Not great actually. Um... Couldn't really get started. I mean, I didn't sleep... for a start and, uh... I dunno. I'm, I'm... I don't know, I feel a little unsettled. [muffled techno music thumping] [dog whimpers] [car door shuts] [tires peeling out on gravel] [music fades] [clock ticking] [faint thumping] [dog whimpering] Nice to hear your voice. Oh, I'm-- I'm so sorry. I couldn't get a message to you either. Um... But, uh... Oh, I mean, I don't know, I started, you know. -I found a nice room and I... -[dog whimpering] ...sat and looked out the window. [laughs] It'll, you know, it'll come, I suppose. But, uh, it... Oh, hang on, what's that... Hello? Hello? Oh, that's a bit better. Yeah, I'm just gonna stand by this bit of leaf. Um... Oh, hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? [sighs] Oh, God. Lou? There we are. [dog whimpering] [gravel crunching underfoot] [clock ticking] (GLASS CLINKING, THUMPING ON TABLE) [hand patting dog] [pill box rattling] -[glass thumping on table] -[box snapping shut] It's so lovely having you look after me like this, darling. And very spoiling. -Isn't it Louis? -[playful whine] Isn't it? Aren't we having a lovely time? [clock winding] [wind moaning softly] -[metal squeaking] -[door shutting] [clock ticking] [faint high-pitched moaning] [faint creaking] [window thumps] [hinge creaking] [sighs] [faint scrape, clunk] [creaking] -[wind blowing] -[window rattling] [taking deep breath] [faint thump] [long creak] [distant bird calling] [Louis whimpering] Mm. JULIE: What are you doing? Do you want to go out? [continues whimpering] [sighs] [mouthing] [whimpering intensifies] [Louis panting] [whimpering resumes] All right. Come on, come on... [whimpering] [lamp buzzing fitfully] [door opens] [Louis whimpers] Okay. Okay. There's a good boy. Go on. Go on, you told me you wanted to come out. Come on, come on. Come on, do a pee. [sighing] Don't you want to do a pee? [breeze picking up] Louis... -Come on, do something. -[Louis whimpers] What were you saying to me? You said you wanted to come out. Huh? What is it? Don't you want to do... Oh, come on. [breeze fades] [distant bird calling] [Louis whining] [wind moaning] [door clicks] [hinges creaking] [Louis whimpering] JULIE: Hello? [bell tolls] [footsteps approaching] JULIE: I'm, I'm sorry. We didn't mean to disturb you. MAN: It's quite all right. I hope you and your mother are having a very pleasant and comfortable stay. We are, yes. Thank you. Very much so. -Good night. -Good night. -[Louis whimpers sharply] -Come on... [footsteps approaching] JULIE: There we are. Oh, darling, thank you so much. You're an angel. I feel terrible taking you away from your work like this. Oh, no. I'll do it later. This is a nice job. Well, it's a great help. I mean, I have a pile and I really want to get them away as soon as possible. Maybe after lunch we could post them. Do you want to take one of my little helpers? I don't want to get dependent on anything, so... I-- I understand, but just-- just say the word. I have them you know, and I find they're marvelous. They just-- You know, I go straight off. No, I'll go for a longer walk today and I don't know... maybe drink less coffee. I don't know. Anyway... All right, so I've done the Asbury's. I've done Anne and Michael Saxton-Thomas. Um... uh... Oh, uh, yes, Charles Stowe. Did I tell you that Molly died? So sad. He was so sweet when, you know, when he wrote me such a lovely letter. All right, uh, let's get on with that. With an "E" and "Esquire." And you'll find the address in there. So nice by the fire. Do you remember this room? Was it like this when you were here before? Uh, do you know, I was just thinking. I remember the fireplace very well. Um... I remember being rather frightened of it actually, uh, when I was... Yeah, I mean, it's so funny isn't it, to think that one would be frightened, but I... Although, I have happy memories of this room. Um, I think, uh, you know, Aunt Jocelyn was, um... ...always filling it with children. And, uh, didn't have any of her own, but she, you know, she took us in and she took the cousins, and yeah... Happy times. And... I mean, did you, did you-- Were you aware of the war going on? Did you have bombers going over or...? Yeah... Well, I mean, you're not far from Liverpool here, so yeah there-- [exhales] there were... Darling, let's get on with these cards. -I mean, I-- -All right. Can we? Do you mind? Let's-- I'm-- The truth is I feel a bit wobbly today, so I just-- Oh, Mum! No, just I dunno, I just feel a bit sort of cold, even though we're by the fire. You look a bit cold. Oh, would you like a scarf? -I'll go and get you a scarf. -No, well don't-- -Yeah. No, easy. -I can do it darling. -I'll get one later. -No, no, no, I'll get it. -She's such a fusspot. -[affectionate whine] Isn't she? [receptionist humming melody] [pen scribbling] [wind moaning] [bird twittering] [bird continues] [pen scribbling] [light moaning] [bird flapping wings] [low rumbling] [receptionist humming melody] [bell tolling] [flatware clinking] Is your room nice, where you've found to write? JULIE: Mm. Didn't get any work done today. Maybe it'll just take a little time. MOTHER: This was, um... This is a room I remember very well. Um... it was a drawing room. [clears throat] And, uh... It was hung with tapestries. I mean, real tapestries, not what they have now but, um... And, uh... It had a needlepoint fireguard, which my Aunt Joss had made. We had it for a while. -I don't know where it is now. -[footsteps approaching] The telephone was in this room, and my aunt... There was this one day when my aunt, um... -[kicks plastic bag] -There's a bag on the floor. -Finished? -Um... yeah. Yeah, okay. -I'll bring in the main. -Thank you. Um... And I remember her voice, particularly. Very low. Oh, my cousins and I were mucking about on the stairs, and... and she came out of the room and made an absolute beeline for me, with this very serious look on her face. Which was rare, 'cause she was a very merry soul generally. Um... -Mm. -[faint creaking] And there'd been this... ...news about Peter. His, uh, plane had been lost over the English Channel. Yeah. And, um... Mummy and Daddy had the funeral in London and they thought it best that we stay here with Aunt Joss, which we did. Um... We went to the beach. And my brothers, my... my older brothers... they went. They were old enough to go. Mum, I'm so sorry. Oh, darling, no. I didn't know. I feel so bad for bringing you here. That's what rooms do. They, they hold these stories and... We're here now. And that was then. And, and there's just this muddle in me, of when-- when it is, exactly. -That's all. -Well you always said you had such happy memories here and that's why I thought... Oh, darling I did-- I did have happy memories here. But I also had other memories here. I had all sorts of memories here. -And they, they... -[footsteps approaching] You know, they're all still alive. -[sets down plate] -Battered cod. Kitchen's closing soon. Thank you. That's quite a helping. Could you help me with this? I'm not sure that I could manage all of that. [laughing] Oh, no, Mum! Look how much I've got. Just leave it if you can't eat it. I don't see a fish knife, either. Yeah, I don't know which one we're supposed to use. [quietly] All right, let's see... [cutting food] -I feel so bad. -For what, my darling? To bring you back to a place which you have such sad memories about. I mean... I'm-- I'm really sorry. I wanted to come. I'm so grateful to you for bringing me. This is a-- this is a lovely thing for us to be here together. JULIE: I... I... I feel really bad for coming now. It's not your fault. Mum, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. [voice trembling] I'm so sorry. [cutlery clicking] Nothing's your fault. [Julie stifles sob] Mmm. [Julie sniffles] [crying] MOTHER: I don't know. I mean, it's not like any of us could have done anything to stop it. So you just have to take it, don't you? You know, you can't regret it because you didn't have any say in it. [voice shaking] Mm. I mean, that's what life's like. Just... You know, you roll with the punches. [muffled techno music thumping] RECEPTIONIST: Why haven't you been answering your phone? [footfalls on drive] Why haven't you been answering-- Alfie! What's wrong with you? Why you driving off?! What is wrong with you? What is wrong with you? [car revving] [light thump] Oh, there you are. I'm so sorry. It's even later this time. Um... how are you? Yeah, sorry, it's not very good. Let me just go over here. I think it's kind of best up against the hedge. [light chuckle] Oh, oh, um... Oh, I don't know, I'm actually having a kind of bad day. I'm having doubts about the whole project. [Louis whimpers] I don't know, I just feel so guilty. [sighs] I can't really explain it. I mean, it's got something to do with being here, but... [sighs] Oh, anyway, I... Darling, you know, it's actually really cold out here. I think I'm gonna have to go in and get Louis in. So, uh, I'll call you tomorrow when I can, okay? I hope it'll be earlier. What? Hello? [wind blowing] [faint thumping outside] Are you all right, darling? I'm fine, Mum. I won't be long. You've been an awful long time. [pill box rattling] [Louis panting lightly] -[exhales] -[Louis whimpers] Yes, my boy. [sighs] [window rattling] [bag rustling] [hinges creaking] [Louis whimpers] [light whimper] [panting] There we... Louis? [wind blowing] Louis! Louis? -Louis! -[distant animal calling] Louis! Louis? [wind moaning] Louis! Louis! Louis! [bell tolling] Louis! Louis? MAN: Are you all right? JULIE: Oh! I'm so sorry. My-- my mother's dog. He's vanished. I don't know where he's gone. MAN: I'm sure he's not far away. JULIE: Louis! [bell continues tolling] JULIE: Louis! -Here, boy! -Louis! JULIE: Come Louis! Come! Louis? [croaking bird call] Louis? [gravel crunching underfoot] Louis? -[gasps] Oh! Oh. -[whimpers] [quietly] Now, you stay there. Stay. Don't move. [lamps buzzing fitfully] I wanted to tell you, he's found! -[Julie laughs] -Oh, good! And to thank you so much for your help. You're most welcome. No, I feel awful for having involved you. Oh, it's perfectly all right. So grateful. Thank you. Well, we should celebrate. Why don't you have a seat? Well if... if I'm not disturbing you. -No. -That would be lovely. -Thank you. -I'll be with you in a moment. Thank you. I'm so sorry. Don't be. He's back. He's safe. -[sniffs] Yeah. -Cheers. [laughs] Cheers. -[chuckles] -I'm Julie. I'm Bill. -William... -Yes. Was my father's name. -Ah... -Mm. -He's no longer with us? -No. He, um... he died a couple of years ago. Oh, I'm sorry. My wife died about a year ago. -Oh, I'm so sorry. -She worked here. -She was the chef. -Oh. We had about thirty some years working in this place together. And, um... I could have retired, but I decided to stay on. Pretty much because of my wife. And the memories that we have of working here. You might have heard me playing the flute. Um... something that I picked up shortly after she died. And so I sit in the office or in the kitchen and I play for her. Because I never played for her before. And, um, so it's like a new chapter in our relationship. And what do you do? -I'm a filmmaker and I came... -Ahh. I came here, um, with my mother to, um... ...to try and write a film about my mother and I. Ah. But not easy. Uh... I-- I can't even get started. [murmurs] Why is that? [exhales] I... I think I'm not sure I feel I have a right... ...to do such a thing. It feels like trespassing. It's really difficult for me to think of her being sad. You know, I want her to be happy. I just want her to be happy all the time. There are memories here that I... ...um, have with my wife that are not happy. Um... I make my rounds. And, of course... that's the time when memories flood back to me. And I make my rounds quietly in the evening. Through the building and on the grounds. And I suppose it is a way of staying in touch with my wife. So I can understand you wanting to make a film about your mother to... ...keep that sense of that relationship with her. It's difficult, isn't it? And I really am so very, very grateful to you -for all your kindness. -Oh, you're most welcome. You've really been a great, great help. I wonder, tomorrow, before my mother's birthday dinner, we're, we're going to have a drink to toast her, and I wondered if you'd like to join us? Oh, that's awfully kind of you, but I have family business, so I won't be around tomorrow evening. -But thank you so much. -Not at all, I just... -It was a thought. [chuckles] -Good night. -Good night. -Rest well. Thank you. [door latches] [bell tolling] [window rattling] [metal creaking] [faint thump] [soft thud] [wind blowing gently] [faint creaking] [window rattling] [rattling continues] [clock ticking] [dishes rattling] [singsong] Happy Birthday! [nibbling on fingernail] [bird calling] [faint thump, creaking] [Louis whimpers] There was a time when, uh... when... when we hoped that-- that they might, uh... But, uh, but no. -And now she has her work. -Mm. And she makes her films, and they are... ...as time consuming, uh, and as energy consuming I would suggest, as a... as a child might be. -Oh, yes. Mm. -Each one as they come along. -Yes. -Um... Yeah, I mean, uh... I'm... I'm sad for her that she doesn't have a child, because I think she would have... uh... I was going to say she would have been a wonderful mother, but the truth is, she is a wonderful mother. -Mm. -She has a great capacity for... ...practical, the practical magic of love. -Yes. -You know, she does it well. -Yes. -And I'm, these days, very much the recipient. Well, I've always been the recipient. -[Bill laughs] -But particularly now that, uh, that her father's left us. She's, um... diligent to a degree. -BILL: And looks up to you. -Yes, she really does. Oh, darling, I want you to do me a favor, and if you see me nod off, I want you to give me a nudge. Don't you want to go to sleep? No, I don't want to go to sleep. Don't you want to have a nice nap? Oh, I don't know, it's just yesterday, after lunch, I dropped off and I... it was like this kind of... Can't really explain it. Sort of dread. What kind of dread? Being here. I mean... There's no question there are... [sighs deeply] um... you know... ...all sorts of memories popping up. It's inevitable I suppose. You know, even in this room. So many. JULIE: What sort of memories? Well, I mean, you know, the longer we're here, the... the more it comes back. You know, the times I've been here. When, when I... ...came to visit... Aunt Joss. Not just when I was a child, but later. What sort of memory? You know, when I was, um... when I, when I was, uh... ...when I was expecting that baby. Oh, yes. I was here. Oh, Mum. I had no idea. Yeah, well, no, I mean, you know, how could you darling? But, uh, I mean, I... ...virtually forgotten it myself. But, you know, I was thinking, you know, it was... It was around about this time of year. And, um... [wind moaning softly] Yeah, I mean... [inhales through teeth] And I was in this room. And we'd been for a walk. Too long... I think. Yeah. And, um... And I started to bleed. Oh. I was here without Daddy, but then... I was taken to hospital, and, um... when he came there... the thing I can't stop thinking about was I wasn't very nice to him. Oh, Mum. I mean, in the circumstances... I was really quite horrid, actually. Daddy would have understood. He would have understood. Mum? Mum? [knock on door] -Hello? -Hi. Your cousin's downstairs. -Alistair. -He's here? -Yeah, yeah, yeah. -Mum, Alistair's here. [chuckling] Darling! Didn't you call him back? Oh, well, uh... oh, that's a surprise. Could you-- could you tell him that I'll be down in a second? -Yeah, okay. -Thank you very much. -[laughing] -What shall I do? Oh that's awful. Well you must go and get rid of him. Get rid of him. I... okay. Oh, my God! Louis... Louis, you go down. -Take Louis. -Come on, come with me. Come on. Come on. Oh, my God, it's so awful! [laughs] Whoops! Good boy. -ALISTAIR: Writing? -Yeah. -Another film? -Yes, another film. Another film. So look, I've bought these. I know it's, uh, Rosalind's birthday. Oh, no, you remembered. That is so touching. -Um, thank-- -Hope you have a lovely day. She will be thrilled. We're having a really lovely celebratory day. Good, good, good. (CONVERSATION CONTINUES, MUFFLED) [Julie and Alistair murmuring] -ALISTAIR: Okay. -So much love to everybody. ALISTAIR: Love to you all. -JULIE: I certainly am and... -Okay, darling. All the better for seeing you and give everybody lots of love. -And I'll see you soon. -Yeah. -Louis, come here. -Take care. ALISTAIR: Okay, so Louis, you're not coming with us. Bulgy, come on. In the back. Come on, let's go. -[dogs barking] -[Julie laughing] Say goodbye... Okay... Take care of yourself. Yes, good boy. -[car starts] -Louis, come on. [water splashing in bathtub] [footsteps approaching] -[feet stumbling] -Oh! -JULIE: Are you all right? -No, I'm fine. [mother sighs] I love that dress. What's all this? Yeah, Louis and I did it. You are naughty. [sighs] It's too much. Which one are you gonna open first? Oh, I don't know. What do you think? Well what about the one on your plate. All right. What can that be? Such pretty paper. You'll be seeing it again at Christmas. [gasps] Oh, my. Goodness me, I recognize that. Oh, darling. Little box. [gasps] (CHIME PLAYING "HAPPY BIRTHDAY") Oh, no. Do you like it? Oh, that's the dearest little thing. It's like... it's like the one Dad gave you. Oh, how lovely, darling. Thank you so much. I'm going to put it on my dressing table. Next to my pill box one. Thank you so much. I thought it would be nice. One from Daddy and one from me. Okay, which one next? I think I might spin it out, actually, darling. -All right. -Save them up. -Feeling a bit puffed, actually. -[footsteps approaching] RECEPTIONIST: Hi. Would you like me to open the champagne for you? Oh, no, no. Don't worry, I'll do it. Thank you. -Yeah? Okay. -Yes, thank you. You ready for some bubbles? Going to do it yourself? Good girl. I don't want to do any damage to the beautiful ceiling. [laughs] -[cork pops] -Oh! [chuckles] Oh, darling, just a-- just a little. -[sparkling wine pouring] -Just a, just the tiniest drop. That'll do it, thank you. Thank you, thank you. Happy birthday, Mum. To us. Oh, I'm actually starving. Oh, lovely. Mm! Bubbles went up my nose. [sniffles] What do you want? Know the menu quite well by now. Oh, yes, um... I think I'm gonna have exactly what I had yesterday. I thought it was-- I've been thinking about it all day. Yes. Let's have a look. You know, darling, I'm not sure that I can manage any dinner quite yet. -I think I'll, uh, -Oh, Mum. You have to have something. Just a starter? I'll just... I-- Just nothing, I think, for the moment. Well we can wait. Yeah, we can... Yeah, we can order later. You... you choose something lovely and I'll, uh, enjoy watching you eat it. No, I... No I, well, I'm... I'm... I'm not that hungry. But you just said you were starving. Well, I'm not gonna sit eating if you're not gonna have anything. -Well, whyever not? -Well-- Well, maybe I'm not hungry. You say you're not hungry. Oh, darling, don't be so silly. Well, I... Well, you order something lovely, and, uh... and-- and enjoy it. [voice breaking] I don't have any hunger if you aren't hungry. The second you tell me you're hungry and you want some food, I will be hungry for it. But if you're not gonna eat anything... Oh, darling, wha... Don't, just don't push me. I... I'm not feeling very well. Well, we can go up if you like. We don't have to sit here. No, don't fuss. Don't fuss. Don't fuss. It just makes me feel worse when you do. I'm not fussing. What do you expect me to do when you say you're not feeling well? It's like a nightmare. Oh darling. Have something delicious and... and I'll enjoy watching you eating it. I'm not hungry. I'm not gonna eat if you don't. Mum, I don't know how this happened. Well, how did-- I just want you to be happy. I just-- I'm trying all the time to make you happy. I can't keep guessing. Can't you just tell me, you just... You're like a sort of mystery person to me. And I, I've spent all my life doing this. Trying to figure out how to make you happy. And I have a life of my own. I have a husband who I neglect completely, and I don't have that much time left. And I don't have a family beyond you. I don't have any children. And I'm not gonna have anybody to fuss over me when I'm your age. [panting lightly] [footsteps approaching] [under breath] Ah, fu... Are you ready to order? JULIE: Um, we're not actually gonna have anything. Um, thank you very much. Nothing at all? No, no, no. Not, not, no-- I'll let you know when we do. -Okay. -Thank you. Mum, I really didn't mean to say that. [Julie crying] [Julie sniffling] [footsteps approaching] -Yes? -Are you ready for the cake? Oh-- Could you come with me, please? Could you not mention the cake at the table? -Um, okay. -If you could go and collect it, bring it here, with the candle. I will light the candle. -All right. -Quick, go and get it. Yeah, I will. [Julie sniffles] -I said I wanted to light it. -Okay. And I want to carry it in like this. Thank you. Thank you. [singing] Happy birthday to you [sniffles] Happy birthday to you Happy birthday, dear Mum Happy birthday to you Do you want me to do it? [sobbing] [muffled techno music playing] [bell tolling] [Julie crying softly] [Louis whimpering] [Julie continues crying] [Louis whines] [crying continues, faint] [crying stops] [faint crying resumes] [knocking lightly] [lamp buzzing fitfully] BILL: Are you all right? [sighs] [light sob] [crying] I just... I didn't get it right. You did everything right. You did. [crying lightly] Now, get some rest. And I'll see you in the morning. -Good night. -Good night. [Louis whimpers softly] [clock ticking] [lamp buzzing] Mum... [Louis whimpers] [wind blowing softly] [wind moaning] [moaning fades] [birds twittering] [door shuts] -Good morning. -Morning. RECEPTIONIST: Are you gonna be okay with your bags? Yes, thank you. -There. -Thank you. Um, I just wanted to say before you go that I, uh... I hope you're okay. Thank you.

Thank you for all your kindness. You're most welcome. [motor starts]
