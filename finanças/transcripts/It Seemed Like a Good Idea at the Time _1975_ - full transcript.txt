SWEENEY: You saved my life. [music playing] Sweeney, you lousy mother! [cash register ka-chings] Uh-oh. Ooh-hoo! [marching band plays] [cheers] I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow her house down! Ha, ha, ha! [gunshot] [siren] Not this way. That way, you idiot. [tires screech] [siren] SWEENEY: Oh, oh, oh. Where am I? Oh, what does it say? Oh, director of (MUMBLING) ha, ha, ha, Harry (MUMBLING) name. Hi, fellas! [interposing voices] SWEENEY: What's this then, film editor? Oh, clip, clip, clip. Ha, ha, ha. Sound editor, beep boop, beep, boop. Sound recording [growls]. Heh, heh, what's that, animation? Oh, [hisses] Production manager, Liz (MUMBLING). Writers don't get-- [inaudible] so many writers, [inaudible]. Get out of my way. [phone rings] Who's this? Funny fella. That's better. [laughter] Who's this? Wake up here. Action, action, action, action, action, action. Breakfast, Moriarty! Six goddamn months, and nothing. End of another artistic phase, eh? Well, that's how it goes sometimes. Shapes. Uh-huh. New images. You've got to think, right? I've got to think. SWEENEY: There. [music playing] Ah! [grunts] [laughter] GUARD: No, not her again! Hey! Come back here! Hey! Oh heck. [cuckoo clock] Sugar cubes. GUARD (ON PHONE): Yeah, [inaudible]. Sugar cubes. GUARD (ON PHONE): Anything else? GUARD (ON PHONE): No. Something I can do, Mr. Prince? No. Well, Georgina, your mother's at it again. [humming] Georgina? Well, that does it. That just does it. Do you hear, Georgina? Georgina! This time, your mother's gone too far. You may be trying to get her creepy old house declared an historic monument, but it won't work. Because I'm going to invoke the writ. Do you hear? In fact, not only am I going to invoke the writ, but I'm going to knock her goddamn house down with her in it. Were you talking to me? Oh. Another exorbitant bill from your couturier? Even if it was, it would be insignificant compared to the one you got from that tasteless decorator for desecrating the apartment while I was away. [grumbles] I'll get out right here, Maurice. I'll see you later tonight, all right darling? Bye-bye. The captain sends his compliments, Madam, and wonders if you'd ever take another cruise again. [laughter] Are you sure-- are you sure you won't have one? GEORGINA: Positive. Well, I will. [laughter] Oh, what's this? Ah, Mrs. Isobel Chorley requests the pleasure of the company of Mr. and Mrs. Ronald Prince at a reception for Mr. Sinclair Burton-- Sweetie, put that down. --Friday next at 8:30. It's nothing to do with you. Now what? I want to see something. --reliable claim to historic interest. The matter of what may or may not represent our heritage has long been one of contention. And there's not question in my mind but that any such claim-- - Him? - Mm-hmm. What for? None of your business. Any man you express an interest in, my dear, is my business. Oh no. Not any more. Your days of exclusivity are over. Ow! If you must know, Ronald is backing Burton's campaign for mayor. Oh, how attractive. Bribery and corruption go hand in hand to the voters. Since when have you been interested in politics? Since that unctuous creep has plans to swill from the public trough. Don't be coarse. I'm sure he'll make a very good mayor. Sinclair is very progressive. Oh, it's Sinclair, is it? How do you know he's progressive? I told you, it's none of your business. Anyway, he's a marvelous man, and you're not fit to lick his boots. But he's fit enough to lick your husband's ass, is that it? You're so obscene. I can't think why I ever married you. To bath in the reflected glory of my talent is why, my dear. That is until your bourgeoisie caused it to shrivel up like an old man's dick. Don't be disgusting. Before we were married, you said that I inspired you. I was wrong. You couldn't inspire graffiti in a public toilet. What's the hurry? We are preparing a reception tonight at the home of Mrs. Isobel Chorley, where the elite of the city will declare their support for Sinclair Burton. Now will you stop questioning me? You're not my husband anymore. Which reminds me, you're three months late on your alimony. Christ, George, you're married now. I don't have to do that. But you didn't when you did. Did what? Have to. You didn't when you did have to, so now you still do. Well, the point is academic, sweetness, because I don't have it. - Would you zip me up? - Yeah. Hello, Andre. Hello, Andre, it's Georgina. Listen, Sweeney's still behind on his alimony, I want you to have him arrested. All right, I'll get it. I've got it. Call off the law. Andre, I'm so sorry. It was a terrible mistake. Sweeney has it after all. Yes, you know how absent-minded these artists are. I'm sorry. Yes. Bye, Andre. It's much easier this way, and you only have three months to go. Symbolic, of course. Of course. Three month's blood, sweat, and tears, perpetuating the consumer society. And that fat blood-sucker downstairs still ripping me off for 90% when I sell a painting. Adversity is good for the soul, they say. Hmm. Of course, you realize what getting laid and getting paid for it makes you, don't you? Not what you think. I came here to collect the money that is legally mine. I just threw in the sex gratis. [inaudible] art. Because I love you. And because you're terrific in bed. As good as your madly attractive husband? Yes. Although it is true that he has a much, much bigger-- Yes? Bank balance. [laughter] Jones, Jones, Jones, why are you out to destroy me? I'm not out to destroy you. Haven't I always believed in you? Change. When everyone else thinks you're certifiable. Change, change, change. And don't I still? Change, change, change. Yes. Now there, isn't that better? Yes. No, it's not. Come on, kiss me. I have to go. You know, sometimes, sometimes I wish we were still married. Oh, no you don't. We're both much better off as we are. We're both healthier and happier. And we make love much more often. Now isn't it marvelous how it all turned out? Well, if it's all so logical, how come it doesn't make any sense? It's not supposed to make sense. It's only supposed to be marvelous. See you next Friday. Marvelous. [phone rings] Hello. SWEENEY (ON PHONE): Moriarty, this is your guardian angel. It has come to our attention in heaven that recently you've been enormously generous to one of our favorite sons. What do you want, Sweeney? SWEENEY (ON PHONE): Listen, I have acquired an invitation to a party Georgina's going to in aid of this idiot, Burton, who's running for mayor. I thought we'd get a few extra invitations printed up, get some of the gang in, and generally liven things up a bit for her. Get on down here and pick me up, OK? [car horn] [tires screech] [car horn] Here we are. This place prints the classiest invitations in town. Now we want 200 of these in an hour, or his sister can forget the judo classes, OK? Now you know what to do with them? Right. Good man. [laughter] Why you-- Excuse me, sir. We have an emergency. We have a badly abused copy of "Lady Chatterley's Lover" which is in desperate need of an ink transfusion. It's touch and go. [tires screech] [car horn] Oh this is the Chorley residence. You met her before? No, I-- - Oh, hello. - I'm Sinclair Burton. This is-- - Oh yes. This is Mrs. Prince. How nice. GEORGINA: Hello. My dear Miss (STAMMERING) Prince. Yes. I was so delighted when the ladies from [inaudible] committee I asked if they might hold the reception here. There is no question in my mind that a candidate of your background should-- Hortense, put those flowers in there. HORTENSE: Yes, ma'am. Don't you agree, Mrs.-- Prince. Mrs. Ronald Prince. Oh, uh-huh, yes. Your husband builds things, I believe? Well, not personally. He owns Prince Construction. They built the Chorley Auditorium. Really? You would have thought my late husband would have mentioned it, wouldn't you? However, I always feel that once one has decided which candidate should occupy a public office, it behooves one to-- no Albert, not the Wedgwood, the caterers are bringing their own. Don't you agree, Mr.-- Burton, yes. My late husband always used to say-- just open them a little wider, so that people can see what's in between. You would be one of the Elmville Burtons, Mr.-- Burton. You would be related to Humphrey Burton? My great-uncle. Oh, we never could understand why he was retired from the bench so early, and resigned his position as commissioner of the Boy Scouts at the same time. My late husband always used to say that he never did quite get to the bottom of that. Are you not supposed to be laying these tables? The gentleman said he was going to get the cutlery, ma'am. Oh, Albert? Yes madam? Albert, these two young ladies are waiting. If you don't hurry up, they'll never get laid. Well, my dear Mrs. Chorley, it's most reassuring to know that the arrangements are in such capable hands. Now if you'll forgive me, I really must leave, but I'll see you later at the reception. Oh, are you coming to the reception? Oh, how splendid. I'm so glad you're able to attend. You really must meet the candidate, Mr.-- (STAMMERING) Burton. Yes, yes. Have you met him already? Oh, such a charming young man. His great-uncle, you know, was-- Until this evening. ISOBEL CHORLEY: Hortense, please hurry with those flowers. Buggy. [dog barks] Buggy, come to mommy, darling. Aww. Hortense, Hortense, I thought I told you to bring these flowers in here. Oh, was that Hortense? She looked pretty relaxed to me. And who might you be? Sebastian Stockwell, a humble toiler in the ranks of Mr. Burton's campaign, sent hither to oversee the installation of the practical equipment, the staging, and the lighting, and other theatrical devices. Oh. Oh, I see. Well, Mr. (STAMMERING0 I hope you're capable of seeing that everything proceeds according to plan. I think so, Madam, yes. [music playing] [inaudible]? Yeah. [inaudible] party, [inaudible] 8:00 [inaudible] gonna get [inaudible] [humming] [interposing voices] Some rich broad is throwing a bash, [inaudible] crash [inaudible] OK? Got it? Right on. [humming] [music playing] [humming] MORIARTY: You're sure it's quick acting? PHARMACIST: You better believe it. Quick action laxative. [laughter] [humming] Gotcha! [dog whines] ISOBEL CHORLEY: Buggy! Buggy? [dog whimpers] ISOBEL CHORLEY: Buggy! Buggy! [dog whimpers] ISOBEL CHORLEY: Where are you, you naughty boy? ALBERT: Mr. and Mrs. [inaudible] Good evening. Maurice, you wait in the car. Ronald. Good evening. Park on the right. Next. GEORGINA: Remember, you're not to drink too much. These are the elitest. [dog barks] [person growls] ALBERT: Mr. and Mrs. Richard [inaudible]. Mr. and Mrs. Ronald Prince. - Hello. My dear [inaudible], good to see you again. Oh, Mrs. Chorley. How nice of you to come. And how marvelous you're looking you haven't changed a bit since (STAMMERING)-- This afternoon. Exactly, yes. Yes. And that charming young man who was with you. My husband. Oh no, not you. - Mr. Burton. - Mrs. Prince. - Yes-- - It's nice to see you. It's nice to see again. Well, have you two met? ALBERT: The right Reverend-- Oh, I see you have. Well, I'm so glad you could all come. Here we go. [laughter] Huh? From Mr. Prince. Thank you. Yes, Bishop, things are a little quiet just this present. But I'm sure they'll liven up. ALBERT: The Honorable Milton J. Ballcock. My dear Mrs. Chorley. Darling. SWEENEY: How delightful to be present at what has to be-- - Darling. - What? There's someone very anxious to meet you. Hello. Hello. I'm very pleased to make your acquaintance. So am I. Mr. Burton, a great honor. I regret that my brother Vladimir could not be here this evening. He is presently incarcerated for a minor social offense. But he assures me that immediately upon his release, he will campaign strenuously on your behalf. My dear lady, you must forgive my footwear. My valet searched everywhere for my dancing pumps, but to no avail. However, sooner than give up the chance of dancing with you, my dear-- Are we acquainted, Mr.-- Indeed we are, madam. In fact, I think I can say in all modesty that your late husband regarded me as one of his closest confidants. Oh, uh-huh. ALBERT: Senator and Mrs. Eugene Banderkirk. A bientot, my dear lady. GUEST: I have crossed the very threshold of your home-- [interposing voices] GUEST: --in pursuit [inaudible] divine [inaudible] It was just breathtaking. I've never experienced anything like it before in my life. Neither have I. Excuse me. [interposing voices] ALBERT: Mr. and Mrs. Julio Escpaldi. [interposing voices] Well, I think if a man is prepared to leave all that sort of thing behind him and make a fresh start in policy, I'd say good luck to him. [laughter] Excuse us. What are you doing here? I have an invitation. Oh, I'm sure you have an invitation. Now listen to me. My dear lady, noblesse oblige. Duty bound, I arose from my lonely-- Sweeney-- --desolate bed of pain, afflicted as I am-- Sweeney. --by a recurring attack of beriberi-- I don't know what you have-- --contracted while I was a missionary in Africa. --in that deep recess you call a mind. But I'm warning you-- Ah, here he comes now, our worthy candidate. I shall engage him in meaningful conversation. Issues of the day, stuff like that. You stay away from him. I just want to talk to him, George. - Don't talk to him. - I want to. Don't even go within speaking distance of him. OK. Just take the free food and booze, which is what I'm assuming you came here for, and leave. Because I'm warning you, if one little thing goes wrong-- Oh, ho. --one tiny little thing goes wrong with this reception, you will be in more trouble than you ever dreamed existed. [speaking french] Get out. [party chatter] We're doing everything we can to help you. I'm sure with your support, we'll succeed. Sinclair, why don't we have a bite of food? Yeah, sure. Who is that? Who is what? That fellow you were talking to. That? I don't know. Party chatter, you know how it is. GUEST: Million and a half for that? Archie, you got taken to the cleaners. [laughter] Mrs. Chorley, please. [interposing voices] Lovely party. Hmm, him again. Is it fast acting stuff? Man, this is lightning. One slug of this, and they're off and running. Whoop. SINCLAIR BURTON: You mentioned to me that you thought I might be persuaded to declare your mother's house an historic monument. Yes, I thought you might be persuaded. SINCLAIR BURTON: Then I think perhaps we should discuss it privately. I know just the place. It's very private. Good. Sometime soon, I hope. Soon. How about tomorrow? [groans] What was that? What was what? Nothing, I'm just feeling edgy, I-- Don't be silly, everything's going beautifully. Nothing could possibly go wrong. Would you hold this for me? SINCLAIR BURTON: Yes, certainly Where are you going? To the powder room. I'll be right back. [party chatter] How are you, Mr. Mayor? Well, you're jumping the gun a bit, aren't you? Oh, nothing to worry about. You want it, money will buy it. No, believe me. What, are you hungry? No, no. This is Georgina's. She's just gone out for a moment. Here' I'll take it. We'll get her another one. What's this? Oh, this is good. I'll have some more. Oh, thank you. RONALD PRINCE: It's the dressing. It's very good. Very Very nice. RONALD PRINCE: Not quite Roquefort, but-- SINCLAIR BURTON: Mm-hmm. Excuse me, you haven't seen my ring, have you? - No. - I've lost it. It's about that size, gold. Oh. Well round here sir-- [interposing voices] Perhaps I can-- you know, I lost my ring once you know. Of course, that was a long time ago. Are you-- oh, excuse me. Just looking for a ring. It's about-- but it's not actually mine. It belongs to-- he was here just a minute ago. I was talking to him, and he suddenly disappeared. Driver in the green Rolls. Yeah. [party chatter] Compliments of Mr. Prince. Cheers. Take Prince's chauffeur a drink. One of these. Big, right? Right. Here buddy. Yeah. Compliments of Mr. Prince. [party chatter] Excuse me. Thank you. ISOBEL CHORLEY: Did they belong to my [inaudible]? RONALD PRINCE: That is if I haven't made it clear already. SINCLAIR BURTON: Oh, and what is that? RONALD PRINCE: Well, it's understood of course that my support is predicated on your committee's failure to recognize the claims of certain building's historic value. My mother-in-law's house, for example. Well, it's the duty of the politician to respond to the wishes of the people. Particularly the right people. [laughter] That's my man. I think you better start the proceedings now. Oh yes, madam. Right away. We understand each other, Burton, oh yes. We make a great team. And I think we're going to go places. You mark my words, very soon we're going to be off and running. ALBERT: Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen. [screams] Oh! That dog, he bit me! Oh, Bugs, you naughty boy, where are you? Come here at once! SWEENEY: All is well dear lady. I have your little fellow firmly under control. Oh, thank you, Mr.-- Please don't mention it. You ain't seen nothing yet. [bugle] [yelling] [noisemakers] [drum beating] [interposing voices] There's nothing I can do. Proceed [inaudible] Yes, madam. [interposing voices] Ladies and gentlemen. [interposing voices] You are-- Ssh. ALBERT: Please silence, ladies and gentlemen. May I have your attention? Please. Ladies and gentlemen, pray silence for our guest of honor this evening. Chairman of the committee-- Excuse me. ALBERT: Chairman of the committee for the-- Where you going? To the bathroom, I'm not feeling well. You can't go now, they're just announcing you. ALBERT: --the preservation of-- - Excuse me, sorry. ALBERT: --of buildings of historical interest. [yelling] Also, candidate for the office of mayor, Mr. Sinclair Burton. [applause] [booing] OK, one, I'm very hap-- I'm very happy-- [tuba blast] Excuse me. [laughter] [interposing voices] Excuse me, sir. Excuse me! I really have to-- RONALD PRINCE: --Burton as planning [inaudible] to attend to. Particularly on an occasion like this, where so many of his-- Is there another washroom? On the right, upstairs. Mr Burton will be back, I think. [tuba blast] [laughter] [interposing voices] Ronald, where is Sinclair? Please. Out of my way, out of my way. [interposing voices] I gotta get there! Please, excuse me. [interposing voices] Sorry, I gotta get-- [interposing voices] Wait, can I-- can I get-- Our candidate has had a temporary indisposition. Montezuma's Revenge! [laughter] As I always used to say to my late husband-- don't poke that thing at me, [inaudible]. Go now. [laughter] It seems to me-- it seems to me that those of you of Mr. Burton's campaign who wish to solicit votes would do well-- would do well to behave with a little decorum. [screams] [laughter] [music playing] (SINGING) [inaudible] and running, but I don't [inaudible] [interposing voices] (SINGING) No. Rock and roll, [inaudible] [humming] Oh, excuse me. Are you having a nice time? I hope you're satisfied. Moderately. There are very few parties that can't benefit from the services of a good social director. You're impossible. Why don't we go and get it on some-- No! Would you like to dance? Huh! [interposing voices] Ready for the lights? It's all ready to go. Wait till I give the signal from the back, OK? In case we [inaudible]. [interposing voices] When you consider the time, the trouble, the money that went into this, how did this happen? By no fault of mine. You start to shape up, my friend, or else we'll find somebody else to fill your shoes, believe me. Will you keep out of the way please? Mr. Burton [inaudible] [inaudible]? You will kindly terminate this saturnalia. Yes, of course, Mrs. Chorley. [whistles] [interposing voices] Ladies and gentlemen. Ladies and gentlemen, please. May I have your-- [feedback] Can I have your attention please? [laughter] [interposing voices] SINCLAIR BURTON: Please! Your attention, please! [whistling and cheering] Hold it! [interposing voices] What? What do you think you're doing? Put me down. Put me down. Oh my. [whistling] [laughter] [interposing voices] Sweeney, Georgina. She's leaving, man. Ha ha! That's a cute little cab you've got there, baby. [interposing voices] Ronald! [humming and singing] Get in! Home, Maurice. What's the matter with you? You are drunk. I most certainly am. When I have a good time, I get drunk. And when I'm drunk, I have a good time. And tonight I happened to have a hell of a good time, because I happen to think tonight was a hell of a party. Hmm, you would. You're nothing but a philistine. When I think of how much time I've wasted trying to teach you style and taste. I could cry when I look our apartment. I think of all that money you threw away. Look who's talking about spending money. You're an economic vampire. If money were blood, you'd need a Swiss bank to suck on. You've obviously been over-stimulated by the party, and are incapable of making any sense. Oh incidentally, as of this morning, all your charge accounts are cut off, which makes the most sense since I married you. As far as you're concerned kiddo, the party's over. Of course if you don't like it, you can always leave. That's exactly what I'll do then. Maurice, home to mother. Which reminds me, as of tomorrow, your mother doesn't have any home. I'm going to FOF her. You know what that means? It's a legal expression. It means final order of foreclosure. Oh, and you can take the subway. Maurice has been told you don't take the car without my permission. [laughter] Oh! Maurice? Oh yes, madam? Oh! [laughter] [cuckoo clock] That's it. That's finally it. If that old broad thinks she's going to make a fool out of me-- hello, this is Prince. Yes, I do know what time it is. And if you want to stay on as my lawyer, you better get used to the fact that you're my lawyer 24 hours a day. Don't mention it. All right, now listen. Today we're going to possess that house. [alarm bell] [gunshots] I'm going, I'm going! JULIA: Ha, ha, ha. Hmm. Julia! [gunshot] Her glasses. JULIA: Prince-- Where are her glasses? -- stick your useless head up, you sniveling coward. And I'll make you look like a Swiss cheese. Pull! [gunshot] [cat yowls] Oh, Sweeney, what a delightful surprise. Oh. Julia, my darling, how are you? Give me a kiss. Have you eaten breakfast? I'm just about to feed the cats. I just lost my appetite. But I still have my thirst. [laughter] JULIA: Remember what I told you, Sweeney? Drinking during the day is a sign of decadence. I'll join you. Lovely. I cannot bear to drink alone. You told her that money was more important than love. JULIA: Oh, Sweeney, I spoke from bitter experience. What do you want? [meow] Well, that's a nice warm, friendly greeting for a devoted swain who comes bearing gifts of flowers to celebrate the end of your bondage to your awful wedded husband. Who said it was the end? But after the party last night-- GEORGINA: Last night after the party, as you call it, you were eavesdropping on a private conversation. Car thief! Now wait a minute, I just drove you home. You're bloody chauffeur was bombed out of his skull. Thanks to you. Thanks to you, the reception was a complete disaster. Thanks to you, I was totally embarrassed. And thanks to you, Sinclair was humiliated. Oh, Sinclair was humiliated was he? Well at least that worked. You're despicable. I don't ever want to speak to you again. Excuse me. SWEENEY: Oh, come on, George. Where's your sense of humor? - Ha! No harm done. It's just a bit of fun. Fun? Is that what you call fun? You know, it boggles the imagination how I ever fell in love with you. You still love me. I do not. Would you let me go? No! See you Friday? SINCLAIR BURTON: (ON TELEVISION) And I tell them that when I am the mayor of this city, decisions will be made with that in mind. Because I have talked to the people who live in this great city, the businessmen, the workers, the-- Now what's he doing here? SINCLAIR BURTON: --man in the street-- Well, he's keeping Big Red entertained. She can't move a muscle. Heh, he looks different with his trousers on, doesn't he? [laughter] I think we've heard the last of him. This way lies truth, Sweeney, and beauty perhaps. You know, new forms, new ideas. Big Red and I have been up all night working. Oh? What a waste. You know, Moriarty, I'm thinking of taking a little time off. From what? Please. I know you recognize in my work for my patron, Mr. Bunny, prostitution of the basest kind. Nevertheless, to coin a phrase, it allows me to keep my head above water while the wolf is at the door. Ah me, Moriarty, my mood is fragile, bordering on the melancholic. There are too many rats in the race. I need a little tranquility. I was thinking about going up to the cabin on my own for a couple of days. It's a small place, isn't it? Bijoux. Gonna be crowded. What do you mean? Well, the creaking bedsprings and groaning lovers would probably interfere with your sleep. What lovers? Oh, Georgina was in here earlier today, and picked up the keys to the cabin. What? She has no right. She's got every right. Look, I witnessed a wedding, I witnessed a divorce, and I witnessed the dividing of the property. A part of the settlement is you share the cabin. If one is here, the other one can be there. So you're here, and she's there. Who with? I'll be son-of-a-bitch. Duplicity, thy name is Georgina. No it isn't, by Christ. It's bloody Burton. If she thinks getting laid by him is going to get her mother's house off the chopping block-- oh, that poor innocent child. Sure, Sweeney. Is the key in the truck? Yep. There's no gas. Did you say there was no gas? Mm-hmm. Jesus Christ, Moriarty, your improvidence knows no bounds. Well, I wasn't going anywhere. [inaudible] have you got any money? No. No. Look around you, Moriarty. It's a glorious day, surely meant for pissing away with enjoyment. I have to go and screw the screwers. Oh, the curse of responsibility, I tell you. I just hope my shoulders are broad enough to bear the burden. I tell you one thing, this is it. This is the last time. You said that the last time. SWEENEY: Well, I was wrong, wasn't I? Because obviously, the last time wasn't the last time. It was the next to last time. But this is the last time. Until the next time. There will be no next time, because this is the last time I'm gonna say this is the last time. [breaking glass] Jesus Christ! Hi, Theo! How are you? GEORGINA: How you doing? Blisters. I may never be able to hold another dry martini. Oh, it's good for you. Yeah. Toughen your hands up for all the handshaking you have to do on the campaign. Here. What's this? We're going to get some water. Water? Mm-hm. The walk will do you good. Toughen you up for all the walking you're going to do on the campaign. It's only two miles. Two miles? Oh, come on. Oh, what a lovely day! Come on, Sinclair, look like you're enjoying yourself. [humming] Penny. Penny, come on, up, [inaudible]. [chuckles] [humming] Oh, after you. Thank you. Come on. Come on. Come on [inaudible]. Good boy. [kissing noises] Come on, boy. [whistling] There's some more over there. Oh, [inaudible]. Go on. Go on. Good. Good boy, good boy! Good! Quickly. Don't forget the windows. GEORGINA: Of course it's my mother's house I'm talking about. But That's only part of it. Someone has to see that these lovely old homes are not indiscriminately destroyed. I'm sure you understand that. And naturally, I know that in appealing to a man of your exceptional taste, that you above all else would realize the importance to the community of such historical-- Georgina, a toast. All right. Let's drink to the preservation of historic buildings. To the successful fulfillment of our campaign. Oh. Anyway, as I was saying, I'm just going to get the grapes. Grapes? Why do you need grapes? - Well, for dessert. - You don't need grapes. Oh, ho, ho. No, you don't. You big silly. (LAUGHING) You're tickling me. [coughing] Oh my! This is awful. Let me get the door. [coughing] Oh! Wait! [coughing] Hi, Bill! Hi. How was Egg? Oh, took to the whole idea as though he thought of himself. Isn't that beautiful? You know, he'll hang around that cabin just so long as he knows there's folks that was going to feed him. Yeah, he will, won't he? You bet. [laughter] [phone rings] Prince. We have kidnapped your wife. You must have the wrong number. [laughter] Wrong number? Kidnappers don't get the wrong number, dummy. Prince? RONALD PRINCE (ON PHONE): Oh, you are tiresome, Julia? Julia? You think I can't recognize one of your witless practical jokes? We have kidnapped your wife, and she will be-- RONALD PRINCE (ON PHONE): I've got a judgment against you. And tomorrow, kiddo, heh, heh, you're out. --killed. Would you stop-- guy's crazy. Don't hang up, it's my last time. Listen, we have kidnapped your wife. And unless you hand over $100,000 by the same time tomorrow, you will never see her again. You promise? Promi-- I'm not joking. RONALD PRINCE (ON PHONE): I hope not. If you can prove you got rid of her forever, I'll be happy to pay any reasonable price for your services. Now good night, and goodbye. $2,500? Book of green stamps? Huh. Ooh. (SHIVERING) Ooh. [wild animals howl] [coughing] Ooh. Georgina! [coughing] Whew! Ugh. [coughing] [whistling] Good evening, Moriarty. Good evening, sir. Madam. Good evening, Sweeney, how nice of you to drop by. Have a beer. I don't mind if I do. Thank you very much. Oh well, I suppose each of us has his own way to achieve the nirvana of blessed oblivion. Still, I can't sit here all night listening to your idle chatter. I have business to conduct down at Uncle Ikey's emporium. [bear growling] Hector? Hector. I don't believe it. Sweeney. [bear growling] (SNIFFING) Whew! Out of the way, Hector. Come on. Come on, Hector. Just quit. Come on, that's it. Out of the way, Hector. Please. [car horn] Georgina! Oh! Oh! Oh! Hey, [inaudible] Look, I just want your opinion on a simple matter. You're not handing down a Supreme Court decision. What do you say? I think we have to act upon the assumption she has indeed been abducted. - Sweeney. Now Ronald, I do feel sometimes that in the matter of your wife's family, your views do tend to become a bit distorted. Oh they do, do they? Well, let me tell you something. There is nothing more distorted than Sweeney. And I smell him in this somewhere. Well, in that case we casually drop his name to the police as a suspicious character, hm? And your advice is pay the ransom. My advice is pay-- let me recapitulate. Whether Georgina is in the hands of real kidnappers, or whether the whole thing is an elaborate charade, financially, it's good for us. You see, you're in a higher tax bracket than ever this year. And any write-off would be welcome. Indeed, this is such a gift from heaven that Revenue might think it's our idea. Moreover, the prospect of the distraught husband going to any length to rescue his wife from the hands of desperadoes will compensate somewhat for the adverse publicity we must expect from throwing her mother on the street. Her mother. [cuckoo clock] The kidnapper. I suggest a massive outbreak of publicity. We'll flood the media with news of the tragic event, and how the broken-hearted husband implores the kidnappers to make contact, etc. etc. Then we just sit back, close our eyes, and hope the idiot behind this has the wit to respond. RONALD PRINCE: Right. [laughter] [fuming] OPERATOR: (ON PHONE) Your number, please. Get me the-- get me the police. Uhh, mmm. Sir! Uh, oh! Oh sir! Sir! So you belong to the Diner's Club. Detective Sergeant Roscoe Broom. And Officer Kopek. We're looking for someone named Sweeney, official business. Are you Sweeney? No. You did say Sweeney? - Sweeney. - Sweeney? Yeah. [chuckles] Mm-hmm. The red door-- - Stand aside. - --on the. - Kopek! - Yes sir. - The red door. Yes sir. BROOM: On the double. MORIARTY: --on the top floor. Sweeney, open up. It's the police. Now don't force me to take action, Sweeney. Kopek, break it in. Mm-hmm. There's nobody there, sir. A red door. Mm-hmm. The red door on the top floor. This way, Eliot Ness. The top floor. Yes sir. Sweeney, wake up. Oh. [inaudible] I beg you, please, don't be bitter about Big Red and me. It was the demon drink. It lashed our lust, and before we knew where we were, we were where we are. And it's the heat for you. The what? The heat? Oh. All right, are you Sweeney? (WHISPERING) My god. That's my landlady. We were just discussing the rent. Business, business, always business. And what gentlemen, may I ask, is your business? Sweeney, your ex-wife, the present Mrs. Prince, has been kidnapped. A ransom of $100,000 is being asked for her return. I want to know what you know about it. Oh, a hundred thou, is it? Indeed, the gods are working their weird and wondrous ways. Indeed, Moriarty. Perhaps it would be best to meditate on this insight in silence, whilst I make the fuzz a nice cup of tea. Mad, mad, mad, mad. All these artists are alike. Whatever they say has no meaning or relevance to men of the world like ourselves, practical men of the world. Now, how come you to me with this obvious practical joke? What are you doing with the hands? I transferred out of the vice squad because I had enough of you fags. Fags? KOPEK: Nances. BROOM: Fruits. KOPEK: Gays. BROOM: Poofs. Whatever you preverts call yourself these days. Moriarty and myself? Out of the question. Though now you come to mention it, perhaps I never have eyed the lad in the proper perspective. Moriarty, smile for me. Besides, if we are screwing each other, what in the hell you think she is, a bookend? Well, maybe she's a fag too. You can't tell about nothing these days. You're up for a promotion, Kopek. Just doing my job, sir. I call them as I see them. All right, Sweeney, get some clothes on. Yes, perhaps a small cocktail dress would be ample. Officer, please accept my apologies for my behavior just now. Your muse was so stunning, it send my wits reeling. And I just wasn't myself there for a moment. I shall of course immediately offer $1,000 reward for any information received. My great and good friend Moriarty will generously donate one of his exclusive objet d'arts for just such a purpose, won't you, Moriarty? You see, Inspector? Not a word. Your work has never been so overpriced. Hands clean, heart pure. The strength of 10 men flows through my veins. Whatever madman planned this job hasn't a chance. All right. Don't leave town, Sweeney. I'm not finished with you yet. Kopek. [trumpet fanfare] [alarm bell rings] [explosions] Whoever planned this job hasn't a chance. All right. Don't leave town, Sweeney. I'm not finished with you yet. Kopek. [trumpet fanfare] [alarm bell rings] [explosions] Kopek! Wait for me, you idiot! Kopek! Get this thing out of here! She's out of her mind. [bear growls] [yelling] ANNOUNCER: (ON RADIO) The kidnapping of Mrs. Ronald Prince, patron of the arts, and wife of the millionaire president of Prince Construction. A badly shaken Prince told our reporter today that a ransom of $100,000 was demanded. And in City Hall today-- If you want to see your wife again in one piece, you will deposit $100,000 on a-- what? What did you-- Well, there goes the whole ballgame. I wonder what happened to the diaper pails. Hello. What the hell brings you here? I came here to slit your throat, you-- SWEENEY: Oh, George-- - You! SWEENEY: --George, George. I should have thought a little romp in the back woods with Burton would have put you in a better mood. Well, it didn't. Oh, I'm very sorry to hear that. Tell me about it. I'm not going to give you the satisfaction of telling you. It's enough to know that I've decided to sacrifice my entire future, my marriage, my reputation just to help you. Wait a minute, back up a minute. I seem to have lost the thread. Help-- how are you going to help me? Where is it? Where is what, George? The money. SWEENEY: Oh, come on. I've just paid your alimony. There's another month yet before I have to try and sell my body to an experimental laboratory. No, no, the ransom, my blood money. Your fantasies really amaze me, George. Sweeney, I'm serious. Where is it? I didn't get it. It was a good idea, but it didn't work. What do you mean, it didn't work? Well, you're back aren't you? Yes, but the only one who knows I'm back is you. When I realized that that disaster at the cabin-- Oh, it was a disaster, was it? - Totally. - Oh. Anyway, when I realized that your insane jealousy had driven you to these irrational acts, I knew at once that you were still hopelessly in love with me. I am not in love-- will you stop saying that? I merely knew that Burton had already made a deal with Prince, so-- Oh. Well, in that case, I'm glad he didn't get his part of the bargain. Anyway, I'd already decided to come back to you. - You had? - Yes. And then you devised this divine scheme to get us $100,000 because you knew that I'd only return if you could prove yourself worthy of supporting me. Shut up, Julia. What? You're moving your lips, but it's your mother talking. Nonsense. It's a divine idea, Sweeney. It's the best you've ever had. Was. Is no more. Are you going to risk losing me again? I must admit, I'd never viewed it in that light before. It's not as if I'm asking you to go back to the agency. [laughter] GEORGINA: Sweeney, stop laughing. Sweeney, I'm tired of loving the wrong people because they have money, and starving when I'm with the people I love. George, don't you ever learn from experience? Hmm? No. No, it's always new and for the first time, or else how could I go on? Please, Sweeney, the money? No, George, no. It's not spontaneous anymore. It needs surprise. The thing I liked about it was that it came out of nowhere, and I made a grab for it, like the brass ring. And I missed. Well try again, the carousel's still going around. Very probably, young lady. But who's pushing it? Me. Sweeney, I love you. [inaudible]. I need the balm of a few kind words now and again. Relaxes the spirit, and uncurls the toes. And contrary to what you've heard, young lady, I'm only human, you know. I know. But I suppose being human, one does need money for the essential things in life. And the non-essential things like nourishment. Perhaps it is too good an idea to let go. Of course, fresh plans would have to be made, different directions. New ricochets, retaining one's balance while knocking others off theirs. Tricky. But I know a few tricks myself. Yes sir. Sweeney, where are you going? First things first, Georgina. This is no time to languish on the couch of passion. This is a time for action. "Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood, disguise fair nature in hard-favored rage." And let us send Prince an extortion note. Let us then knobble Burton before he reaches civilization and blows the whistle on us both. On, on, you noble English! Cry, God for Sweeney! (YELLING) England and St. George! [trumpet fanfare] Sweeney. Take two aspirins. Stay in bed. And I'll call you in the morning. Special delivery for Mr. Prince. Special treatment for Mr. Burton. GEORGINA: Hello! Where have you been? Now, Sinclair-- You left me up there. Wait a minute-- Are you sure he'll be all right? Just wait a minute. SWEENEY: Of course he's going to be all right. Just, just wait a minute. Hmm. SINCLAIR BURTON: Let me out of here. I can't [inaudible]. The Egyptians used to do them like this all the time. You'll last for years. Not bad, though I say it myself, for an off-the-cuff job. I think Moriarty will be very pleased-- no, no, no, don't-- don't move. A fall from that height could put a very nasty dent in your underwear. I'll just get washed off. He'll be as hard as a rock in a minute. What I want you to do is just cut his visible means of support, OK? And then we'll be set. For life. For life. For life. It's only a temporary inconvenience, Sinclair. Just as soon as Ronald comes across with the money, I'll call and let them know where you are. And then you can be rescued. And you can tell your whole story to the newspapers. Omitting, of course, our little sojourn in the woods. Yes, that's right. Any flight going anywhere, as long as it leaves here at 8 o'clock in the morning. Where? Hong Kong? Splendid. I have this overwhelming passion for bamboo shoots and snow peas in ginger sauce. Sweeney. How many tickets? Two. Yes, a man of my distinction never travels anywhere alone. There, that's taken care of that. George? - Hm? Are you scheming something? - Me? - Hmm. Why darling, what ever made you think that? Experience, habit, scar tissue. Maybe you have a guilty conscience. Impossible. Now, here's our plan. 0500 hours, Georgina in position with getaway car. 0520 hours, Prince drops money into designated garbage can. 0530 hours, diversion begins. 0531 hours, Sweeney arrives at car with cash. Terrific. There's only one problem. What's that? How does the money get from the garbage bin to Sweeney? Do you remember Houdini hanging upside down in a straight jacket over Niagara Falls? What does he have to do with it? Well, he didn't tell anybody how he did it either. Trust me, sweetheart, OK? Now do you know what you're going to do? Yes, I know exactly what I'm going to do. Good, good. OK, I better be going. Organization is the key to success. Bye. SWEENEY: [inaudible]. SINCLAIR BURTON: (MUFFLED) Please get me out of this thing. [inaudible] Mother? BROOM: You're sure this is the place? Yes. You read the letter. The money? [cat yowls] Place the ransom in the receptacle, Kopek. Garbage bin. RONALD PRINCE: Hey, you be careful with that. That's real money. [cat yowls] BROOM: All right you men, fall in for inspection. All right you men, your cover looks good. Excellent disguises. [cat yowls] Now very important, if you want to pick up your overtime this week, have your time cards in the office by 0900 hours. Any questions? Yes sir. What if someone thinks we're real garbagemen? [cat yowls] All right. Nobody moves until I blow the whistle. [whistle] Take your positions. [interposing voices] Now you better not let him get away. Mr. Prince, trust me. I'm in complete control of the situation. The trap is escape proof. As soon as he sticks his hand in that basket, whoosh, the net drops. Symbolically, of course. Of course. Kopek. MORIARTY: [singing drunkenly] [laughing] SINCLAIR BURTON: (MUFFLED) Hey you, let me out of here! Let me out, please! Please, let me out! [cat yowls] You know you, you let me down. I did? You're not the answers I've been looking for. The what? You betrayed me. I don't even know who you are! Turned me from my true plan. Made me feel like a goddamn interior decorator. (MUFFLED) Uh-oh. Oh my god. Oh. Oh! He's insane! [cat yowls] Kopek, check that out. Kopek-- I don't want anything to scare a man away. Ssh, ssh, ssh. [laughter] I'll show you. I'll show you. All right. Will you stop this noise? Where's Harvey? Harvey? Yeah, he picks up the garbage. I'm not a garbageman. Yeah, sure. KOPEK: Now look, are you gonna stop or not? Come here. Will you just give it to me? I'm warning you, I'm an officer of the law. MORIARTY: Bullshit. All right, you're under arrest. MORIARTY: Look, it's mine, I can do what I want to do with it. Just give it to me. SINCLAIR BURTON: No! [gasps] KOPEK: Come here. [coughing] Oh my god. I've done it. I've created life! I've created life! [choir sings] [drunken singing] Mr. Prince. Mr. Prince, there. BROOM: OK, Sweeney, this is it. [whistle] BROOM: Hold on, I'm on my way! [interposing voices] [whistle] BROOM: Roadblocks in position. [yelling] Hold up! Get those roadblocks in position! Hold it. RONALD PRINCE: Julia! Hey! JULIA: Sweeney! SWEENEY: Julia! [interposing voices] [whistle] All right, who's got him? [interposing voices] Move 'em out. Hit the [inaudible]. It was in there, huh? Yeah, so was Sweeney. What? SWEENEY: Julia! Julia! [interposing voices] [whistle] Who are you? Kowalski, sir. 52nd division. BROOM: Right, never forget a face. All right, Kowalski, good disguise. Thank you, sir. We were hit by a garbage bin. KOPEK: Sergeant Broom! It's all right sir. It's all over but the actual arrest. [interposing voices] I thought as much, the old double switcheroo. Didn't fool me for a minute. Don't worry, sir. KOPEK: Sergeant Broom! - The net is tightening. KOPEK: Sergeant Broom! Kopek! Sergeant Broom, come quick. It's a miracle. Yes, Kopek, we need one. Get in the car. - What are they doing? - What are you doing? [interposing voices] Oh, you're looking out for yourself. After that garbage truck! Sir, the net is tightening [inaudible]. [tires screech] [whistle] Wait for me, you idiot. [tires screech] Don't worry sir, he doesn't stand a chance. All right, two of you in this car. Flanagan, Kowalsk! Kowalski, on the double. The rest of you men follow me! [interposing voices] Kopek! To the right! Kopek! To the right. Now go to the left. Oh, wait a minute. Disentangle that automobile. [car horn] [inaudible] To the left, not the right. Get out of the way! [tires screech] Did you see who was in that garbage truck? No. It was my mother-in law. That means she ends up in jail for extortion. She does? And I can knock her house down? Oh! Oh, come on. [tires screech] There they go, sir. BROOM: Good, Kowalski! Kopek! Turn here. Move it, Kopek. [tires screech] There they are, sir. [chatter] Good work, Kopek. Excuse me sir, did you see a garbage man? Right. [interposing voices] OK. Kopek, Flanagan, Kowalski. Kowalski, assemble the suspects. Yes sir. Imagine him thinking he could double cross me. I wish I'd seen his face. [cat yowls] Oh, you'll see his face soon enough, after he's tap danced his way out of the slammer, which if I know Sweeney, should be about five minutes flat. He'll be back here like a homing pigeon. Terrific. What's not so terrific is Prince saw me. So, he'll be here too. Remember, the biggest you got, Giuseppe. Now zero hour is in 30 minutes. Do any of you men recognize any of these men? SWEENEY: Yes sir. Who, Kowalski? Who? Him, sir. [inaudible] the wife of [inaudible] All right. Kopek. All right, where's the money? Come on, fella. You know we don't get paid till Friday. Look, I'm not a garbage man. You could have fooled me. Look, I'm a police officer. Watch it, Kopek. You'll blow your cover. There he goes, sir. There he goes! BROOM: [inaudible] Follow me! [yelling] [tires screech] Get in the car! He just-- oh my god. No! You are not licensed to go in this automobile! Kopek! [interposing voices] Will you get out this, you-- [interposing voices] BROOM: Hey, stand down. Now hold it! OK. [interposing voices] [alarm bell rings] Sweeney! Mother. Mother, don't you dare shoot Sweeney! [ominous music] It's all over. Ha, ha! Now you better send that old bat out of here with the money before I send the first wave in. Giuseppe, stand by! Yep. Hold it right there! She's at it again. Ronald, control. Darling! Don't you darling me. You're kidnapped, remember? Don't you think we'd better have a little truce talk. Ah, ah, ah, step very carefully, Ronald. Remember the last time I-- Listen, when I want your advice, I'll ask for it. I'm going to knock your house down! You idiots-- MORIARTY: --and the fat dude that's doing all the yelling? SINCLAIR BURTON: Yeah. MORIARTY: You mean you want to talk to him? SINCLAIR BURTON: No, no, I want to talk to him. MORIARTY: Yeah, well [inaudible] LAWYER: Well, of course the joint property-- [interposing voices] RONALD PRINCE: After the divorce, you don't get that kind of money. Well then, I'll be forced to tell the truth, Ronald. And what might that be? That you and Burton arranged the kidnapping in order to wash some dirty campaign funds. Tricky. Shut up. You wouldn't. Well, I-- You would. Prince. You been skiing? Certainly not. I have been forcibly detained in this ignominious position by your wife. If you expect to build as much as a hamburger stand in this city, you better make sure that this fiasco doesn't become public knowledge. You are threatening me? Listen, without my support you won't get elected to the garbage department. Campaigning like that. I am not campaigning. Your damn wife got me into this. She's not my wife. GEORGINA: Then you agree to the settlement? No! Uh, legally speaking-- SINCLAIR BURTON: Prince! Georgina! Prince! Where did he go? MORIARTY: He's over there. SINCLAIR BURTON: Well, take me to him. Will you stand still when I'm talking to you? BROOM: Hold it, Kopek! That way! Mother! [gunshot] [yelling] Oh my god! Run, move out! No! Jesus! Ah! What happened? Shut up! When I get out of here, I'll kill you. Kopek! Huh? They're all under arrest. Uh-huh. [laughter] [cat meows] Hm. Obstructing a police officer in the course of his duty. RONALD PRINCE: Now come on. Attempting to bribe a police officer. Officer, I want to see my-- Creating a disturbance. Inciting a riot. Indecent exposure. You'll be hearing from the police commissioner about this. Discharging a firearm within the city limits. Unlawfully operating a city-owned vehicle. Oh, oh. Et cetera, et cet-- [sneezes] Bless you. Et cetera. [interposing voices] OK, take them away. Kowalski, sir. Right, never forget a face. Polish, huh? GEORGINA: Psst, Houdini. How are we gonna get out of this? George, George, George, have I ever let you down before? MORIARTY: Sweeney, you lousy mother. RONALD PRINCE: What do you expect from that son of-a-bitch? SINCLAIR BURTON: What I expect is a public apology. GEORGINA: Ronald! RONALD PRINCE: We all get arrested. JULIA: You should have been arrested years ago, Prince. [interposing voices] [music playing] (SINGING) Our world's on fire. The magic plan for you, but however I try to work it, it fell through. The dream was lost for the [inaudible] But it seemed like a good idea at the time. You and I, sailing high, leaving Earth below. [inaudible] far behind, no one knows where our love can go. I had this dream of loving [inaudible] and it seemed like a good idea at the time.
