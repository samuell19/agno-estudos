--== McEphie ==-- [woman] Yes! This is it. Our first buy. [man] Choose whatever you want. I will buy it for you. [woman] Aw. [chuckles] There, I found one. This? [man] No, too feminine. How about this? [woman] Looks like it belongs to Tita Lola. This? [man] Seriously? It looks like it's for a talk show. This? [woman] No comment. [chuckles] [squeals] I know! This one. This is the one. -[woman] There! -[man] Perfect! We'll fill this house up. I will put a table here and a TV. We can just relax here. Watch on our 65-inches TV… -[woman] Once we have money. -[man] Surround sound. [woman] Amsterdam… sprawling, endless tulips. [woman 2] Promise you'll take care of this house. [man] I will take care of you, George, and this house. What's wrong with musicians nowadays? [George] We still need an agent. You might want to sideline. [man] I'd rather die than do something I don't want to do! [George] Damn that passion! That passion won't be able to feed us! -[man] Are you tired? Giving up? -[George] Yes! -I'm very, very tired! -[thunder rumbling] [gentle piano music] -[indistinct chatter] -[birds chirping] [child giggling] [gentle piano music continues] I missed you, my friend. Get up, George. -You're here? -Why are you here? -Duh, this is my house! -This is my house, too! [George] What's our story? Excess. In war mode. Excuse me! This is my house! Which, technically, is my house too. The nerve of you to say that. You're not needed here! George, George. I bought that. Which you gave to me as a present. So, technically, this is mine. [grunts] [George] Truth is, our love story started with a fight. -[crowd cheering] -And that is the reason why women are poor leaders compared to us, men. You make things complicated. -[clamoring] -We are both offended and amused that you have the nerve, the temerity… -Temerity. -to say we women are ineffectual leaders because we are "complicated." Men have forced women to be complicated because we have to think for you, men, too, while cooking, cleaning, washing your clothes for you just so you and your simple brains can function. You cannot survive without us. [crowd cheering, applauding] I beg to disagree. We can survive without you. You can't survive without us men. -[man] Yep! -[crowd cheering] We are the ones who get tough because we know what our loss is. Because we don't let our emotions or our morals' purpose prevent us from taking the win. And unlike you, we think more objectively. We see the bigger picture while you obsess with small details like food, hygiene and lounging, which we never told you to do. But you expect us to do it, anyway. You women expect it of yourselves more than we expected of you. You are just as responsible for holding those gender expectations you hate. [crowd cheering, applauding] [crowd] Primo! Primo! Primo! But why are we debating about this? One sex is no better than the other. Men and women are complimentary. [woman] True! I agree! We should not be going up against each other. In fact… we should be together. [crowd cheering] [both| Smooth! I agree. We should be working together. [both] Smoother! But that's not the point of this debate. You really don't want to lose, do you? I just don't want to lose to you. [clamoring] [both] Smoothest! [crowd cheering] [crowd applauding] [George] But our first fight was a good fight. I felt as if I met my match. [cheerful music] [cheerful music dies down] Tita Lola, look at George. She's throwing me out and hurting me. It's Primo's fault. How dare he even show up here. I came back because, first, I didn't know you were here. -Tita Lola, I just want to-- -You can't come back here. You don't have the right anymore. You left, remember? Whoa. Do not revise history. I didn't just leave. You told me to leave. That's different. But you still left. So, that's one and the same. Now leave. -Leave! -No! [George] Primo knew how to fight for something he wants. He doesn't give up. I loved that about him. I wasn't one to say yes easily, but Primo also doesn't accept a no.

Yohan is still young. Mom, no. We'll have Yohan checked up. Oh, I will find a side job. I will apply for student assistant. Do what you want. When are you coming home? [Tita Lola] No more! Can't fool me! -If you say so. -[Baby] What's going on? -What are you doing? -I bought this. -Ah. So, this is mine. -What is? I bought this pair of shorts, so this is mine, too. Hey, hey! -Give it back! -[George] Go, Tita Lola! [Tita Lola] Stop him! Him? Hey! [sobs, chokes] -You jerk! Don't you come back! -Fine! I'll leave! [Tita Lola] Ugh! High-five. Wait, who are you? I'm Primo, George's suitor. [George] He was willing to face my family, even the weather. He was always there when I needed him. [gentle music] Give me that. You're a bit late. The rain came early. [Tita Lola] Isn't it fun here? Hey, come inside! Come on! [indistinct chatter] [Baby] Don't go yet. We prepared a lot of food. -Tita Lola, would you like some dessert? -Wow! Diabetic. Sorry. -Yohan boy, want some? -[giggles] Same as Tita Lola. Let's just give it to your dad. He's dead. Sorry, auntie. [Baby] Yohan, it's time to move on. It's been 10 years since your father died. [Yohan] I'm only 9, Mom. [Baby] Fine, 9 then. [George] In him, I saw a good man. But he doesn't stop there. He had dreams. [Jessica] Hi, babe! Dude, sorry, you really have to roll with the tempo. -Pick up your pace. -It sounded fine. -It sounded fine. -I hear something off. Let's try again. [band rehearses] Wait. There, that's it. Dude, make sure the bass flows with the beat, so you're not lost. -I thought it was okay. -It was. Our music is scattered. We have to sound good together. -Again. -One more time. Perfectionist.

At that moment, I believed. Yes, someday, he will be great. And I want to be there when that day happens. I want to be by his side. So I decided that the fight's over. Okay, fine, you win. I already love you. [dreamy music soars| I was already falling, so I decided to take the leap. And why not? We took the leap together. Days turned into weeks, weeks into months, months into years.

George, where are you? -Are you on your way? -[George] Lock the doors! Hello, Primo? Sorry, I can't come to your gig. Something happened to Tita Lola. Stay back. What happened? [indistinct chatter] [thunder rumbling] [man] What happened here? Hey. [George] He stayed even if people I love had to leave. I'm leaving the house to your care. Take care of it. Tita Lola, stop it. How morbid. It's as if you're giving your last will. [chuckles] Why, is this how a dying person looks like? [chuckles] Is it? [all laugh] Give me lipstick. [George] Together, we faced endings. Love you, Tita Lola. I love you, Tita Lola. We miss you. George, is your dad also buried here? Let's visit him. I'll pay my respects. No, my dad isn't actually dead. That's just what my mom says when someone asks her so she doesn't have to explain why they separated. Mm. So why did they separate? Kidding. [laughs] I won't ask, I promise. I won't. Mm? [George] And together, we welcomed new beginnings. [gentle piano music] We became a team. -A great team. -[Primo] And this one. [George] We could go through anything as long as we're together. -[squeals] -[birds chirping] [George exhales] [Primo exhales] So this is how it feels like when you've invested in something, Jo. Mm-hmm. Jo? "Jo," as in George? No. "Jo," meaning darling, beloved, sweetheart. Dictionary, Jo. -Jo. -Dictionary. Hmm. [clicks tongue] I like that, "Jo." We'll fill this house up. I will put a table here and then a TV there. Down. Don't put your feet up. You'll get the table dirty. -[both chuckle] -Jo. Hmm. Huh? Why? Jo, see this? We can just relax here. Watch on our 65-inches TV, surround sound. [sighs] Then we will watch your performances all over the world. Hmm? That's mighty proud of you. Your Jo is a world-class artist who brought Filipino music to the world. And who's that? That's me, Jo. Of course I will. I will be very, very proud. But I think you will be prouder. Huh? Why? Because the president of your fan club -is a doctor… -Mm. …who found cures for rare diseases. Oh. [clapping] Thank you, thank you. But, what about Yohan and the others when they're already here? They will live here? Yes. I will even make my family come back home. What about our kids? Jo, with us alone, you'll get worn out. And I don't want my queen getting tired. That's why I will be the one to work, Jo. But your queen is not lazy. So let me help you. We'll be the ones to fetch your family from Italy. We'll go to them. [George] Just go back to your family in Italy. Leave! -Leave! Out! Get lost! -Ouch, George! Ouch! -Tita Lola, she's like you! -Leave! -George, I'm gonna fall. Ouch! -Then just leave! Get out of here! I don't have a place to stay, George. Find one. Because you can't stay here. Because we're not together? Yes. And because this house is now for sale. -Why are you selling the house? -None of your business. Just go. No. Never again. [George] As years passed, everything that made me fall in love with him turned out to be the same things I hated about him. [Bowie] That's why I'm telling you. You accepted it without asking us. You'll leave your friends to play for another band? My family needs to eat, Primo. And I'm doing something about it. I've been talking to people. We'll have a regular gig soon. You said that for two years, nothing happened. Bowie, this will be it. I feel it. Just wait a little more. Can I tell that to my kid? "Baby, just wait, okay? "Tomorrow you will have milk, or maybe next week, or maybe next month." Is that it? What about our dreams? We'll just throw this away? Fine. If you want to quit, I can do it on my own. [Mikko] What about your dream? Goodbye review? Goodbye NMAT? I can review here at home. As if you have time to review there, Nanny George. I just haven't reached my quota this month. Why not make him work? Besides, he's not making progress with his band, is he? How many bandmates came and went? Why can't he just help you find buyers? Make him go from house to house. Make him help you. [Primo] I'm not belittling what you do. That's just not my passion. I would rather starve than go there! I would rather die than do something I don't want to do! [breathes heavily] [gentle music plays] [indistinct chatter] -George, it's your turn. -Okay. Hi, sir! Try Primavera! Sir, zero down payment, close location. Sir, please, this won't take long. Hi, sir, Primavera. Nearby location. Zero down payment, ma'am. -[car horn honks] -[screams] Aw. Thank you. How much do I owe you? Consider it as a donation. George, do you still have time to study? What do you plan to answer in your NMAT exam? No down payment? Pre-selling? Primo-vera? Mikko, this is temporary. We're just waiting for Primo's big break. What if it doesn't come? -You're so negative. -And you're naive. [gentle music plays] Sorry, sorry. Dude, let's go. They already left. Good evening. -We'll call for the next rehearsal. -No. -I'll be the one to call. -[man] Hurry up. All looks and no skill. What's the matter with musicians nowadays? How about Tony and Edgar's group? Aren't they hardworking? What's their hard work gonna do, Jo? Do they play well? [thunder rumbling] Jo, I can't get just anyone. They need to understand what I want. Isn't that how it should be, Jo? -Yes. -See? I'm right. Of course you are. I'll try asking around. Maybe there-- Jo, don't. I'll do that myself. Okay? Leave that to me. I'll just do this on my own.

Do you want out? Are you tired? Jo, are you giving up? Are you tired? Yes! I'm very, very, very, very tired! I'm tired of cleaning up your messes, I'm tired of studying, I'm tired of working, I'm tired of wondering how you can watch me work hard just to pay our damn bills while you continuously pursue your passion. Damn that passion. That passion won't be able to feed us! You don't have money to even buy me a cupcake. But you have money for this. For your freaking passion! You have money for this! Always this! This! This! This! Everything's about you, your dreams! You! You! Always about you! [sobbing] Is that really how you feel, George? [sobbing] [George] I'm tired. I'm tired of telling my mom I'm okay. I'm tired of hoping that when I wake up, the Primo I once loved would come back. I'm tired of waiting for you to fulfill your promises. I'm tired of defending you against everyone. Why, George? Don't you trust me anymore? Don't you believe in me anymore? I believed in you. And that was my biggest mistake. I'm tired of looking dumb. I'm tired of being left behind. Am I weighing you down, George? I'm tired of carrying your burdens. You can't do this anymore? I feel… as if I'm wasting my life on this relationship. [gentle music plays] Will your life be better without me? [sobbing] Do you want me to go, George? Just leave, please. Just leave. [sobbing continues] [bittersweet music grows louder] Primo? Primo? Primo? Primo? [sobbing] [gasps] Not only are you late, you come with bad attitude. Sorry. My day just got ruined. Traffic or NMAT? Take it easy. You still have two months left to review. -Um, ma'am, someone texted. -I'm done. -There's a pest in my house. -Ew! Kill it. If you don't do anything about it, it's gonna get worse. The house will get damaged. What a waste. It's been a long time since it was last inhabited, no? -Two years. -See? As in that long. No word from him for two years and now he suddenly shows up to ruin my life again. I don't think we're talking about cockroaches… or rats. Or termites. Does this pest have a name? -Primo. -[screams] I thought so. I want to meet him! Uh… No, don't. Bad idea. So let's do all we can to boost our sales so we can transfer projects, -and you can finally leave that house. -Hmm. That's why I'm selling it, remember? Oh, right. Sorry. Patient is 17 years old, diagnosed with type 1 diabetes since 8 years old. Patient has been reported to be taking his insulin injections irregularly. Is this true? -Yes, doc. -Sorry, doc. -Goodness. Hi. - Hi, doc. -Hello. -Oh, no. Mikko, are you now our junior intern? Ah, yes, doc. My post is at the ER. [chuckles] Okay, do well. Let's go. What about you, George? How was your NMAT? I'm currently attending reviews, doc. -You might replace me soon. -[chuckles] Not in the immediate future, doc. I have a long way to go. Really? That's good. [laughs] Okay. The other one. Ah. I see dot hemorrhages in your retinas. What does that mean? Blood vessels that have ruptured. Nurse. Yohan, come on. Is my son going blind? Uh, no. It's still mild. But if he continues to miss his insulin injections, it will lead to blindness. Okay, what we need to do right now is to consistently maintain his blood sugar level. Mm, Yohan, stop being so hardheaded. Maybe he wants to go after your Tita Lola. Mm. I will not let that happen. When are we going to Amsterdam? That's blackmail. Don't listen to your brother. Save your money for med school. I can handle both, Mom. I just need to sell the house. Promise, George? Once the house is sold, we'll go to Amsterdam? Promise. As long as you take your shots every day. -Hmm. -One minute. How can she sell the house if someone's making a comeback? -Primo's back? -Have some respect. See? He knows who I'm talking about. He's her only ex-boyfriend. When did he arrive? Earlier today, Mom. What does he want? I don't know. But whatever his intention is, I don't care. I'm still selling the house. Let's hope he agrees to sell, especially since you're both legal owners of the house. Why did your Tita Lola believe that your relationship would last forever? Hey, Georgina. -What, Mom? -George, your ex-boyfriend of almost seven years came back. So? [Mikko scoffs] Mom, if Dad came back, would you get back together with him? -Of course…not. -[Mikko chuckles] Hmm. You see? That's how I feel too. [laughs] Really though? Don't worry. Mom, I can do this. I can handle him this time. I will sell the house no matter what. -Okay, fine. -Okay. -Bye, auntie. -Okay. -Bye. -Bye. -Thanks. -Good luck, George. I hope you don't find him when you get back. -Bye! -Let's learn from our mistakes. -Bye! -Bye-bye. -[Axel] Bowie! -[Hiro] Bowie! Hey, long time no see! Come inside! Wait, dude. Someone's got a question for you. He wants to know if you're still mad. Huh? Mad at whom? Of course. I hate his guts. -Why didn't you come sooner? -Ouch. Where have you been? -Come here. -Group hug! Aw. -Bye. -Of course. Dude, sorry. I'm just living with my wife's parents. Even our business came from them. It's fine, Bowie. Thank you. How about your place? We have too many boarders already. I'm good with any side job. I'm fine with that. These guys work at call centers. Don't you have openings? If you know a foreign language, there's a language premium. Yes, that could be. Oh, you know Italian, right? I'm not fluent in Italian. That's the problem. Dude, if only you had capital, I was thinking of a new business, our own record label. Uh, uh, uh, uh. There you go again. Primo, why not try networking? Love, Primo won't go for a job like that. What's wrong with it? Primo, this made our life better. It's okay, Bowie. I'll try it, Ana. -Really? Okay, thank you. -Yes. I'll count on that Primo. I'll call you. -Okay, Ana. -I'll go ahead. Primo, is that you? Is that what you got out of Italy? Or is that what you got out of leaving George? He's right, Primo. Why are you back? To right all the wrongs. In my life, in my circle of friends, and with George. -Boom! -I knew it. You came back for George. Hmm-hmm. What if she doesn't take you back? I have nothing to lose. There's no harm in trying. How will you do that? [both] How? [chuckles] [crickets chirping] Mm. It's quiet. Yes. -[George humming] -[dog barking in distance] Primo! [playful music] [knocking] Good evening, Jo-orge. Did you change my door lock? How dare you! Open the door. Hmm. Don't push me away. And let's talk seriously. Hmm? [exhales] Come in. [gentle piano music] George, I cleaned up a bit because it was so messy. It was the way I left it when… The cockroaches and rats looked like they were playing. I couldn't breathe 'cause of the dust. Glad you're fine. I have only been here for two days. And I have work. No, George. I know that you keep your place clean. That's why I cleared out some of the stuff here. Don't worry, George. I didn't touch your things. Good. So, what do you want to talk about? Where do you want to talk? Here? How about here? It's more comfortable here. I cleaned this. It's not dusty anymore. Primo, Primo, let's stop this timid politeness. We both know we can be savagely honest with each other. [exhales] Okay. I don't want to sell the house. [scoffs] I wasn't asking for permission earlier. I was informing you. But I also have the right to decide. -I own 50 percent of this house. -Yes, I know. Is that it? Okay. Done. Once the house is sold, let's split the profit. George, I don't want money. I want this house to stay with us. Non-negotiable. The house is being sold, and there is no us. I'm sorry, George. [delicate piano music] [exhales] I'm sorry for everything. Okay. Apology accepted. But I'm still selling the house. George, why do you want to sell the house? I'm going to Amsterdam. Okay? Amsterdam? Tulips? That's it? Aren't you ashamed of your reason? What will Tita Lola say? I'm sure my Tita Lola will understand. How about you? Why don't you want to sell this? Truth is, I wanna be with you again. I want you back, George. Still, no. George, are you okay? Of course I'm okay. I have been for years. What did you say, George? [George] Huh? What were you asking? You seem weak. Just because you said you want me back? Mm, no. [Primo grunts] Come-- You have crossed the line this time. I don't see any lines… Funny. [breathing heavily] Shit. [gentle, upbeat music] George, what is this? Isn't this what you were looking for? Lines. 'Cause I realized you're actually right. Both our names are on the title, so that means you're legally entitled to half of this property. -Even this? -Mm-hmm. Fifty-fifty. Where will I sleep? Um… [tape ripping] -[humming] -[door opens] Hey! -Get out. -Why? We're splitting it 50-50, aren't we? Here's my 50, here's your 50. -[exhales] -Primo. Fine. Since I'm generous, I'm giving you 60 percent. Actually, make it 80 percent because we both know how you sleep. I stay here and I just keep moving back while you take on different positions. You punch me, kick me. I don't understand if you're dreaming about karate, because you keep pushing me, until boom! I fell out of the bed. [playful music] Do you remember? Keep the sofa. No. I'm fine with this set-up. Fifty there, 50 here. You get the sofa and the whole living room as long as this stays with me. You sure you don't want me here? Sure. Fair and square. You get the living room, I get the dining room. -Stop. Mm. -Mm. No one crosses the line. No one steps over. And we keep to our own lives. [sighs] Okay. How about this common area? We bought almost everything here. This microwave, this fridge, this gas stove. How will you divide this? The microwave oven stays with me. Okay? Okay. How about the stove, can I have it? Okay. How about the water heater? Then the bathroom has a schedule. How about the refrigerator? Can I have the lower portion while you have the freezer? Oh, okay. Perfect. Stop. That's mine. The freezer's yours. How will I drink cold water then? -You agreed. -I did? Yes, you did. This one's also mine. And this one, and this one, and this one. [giggles] Wait. My schedule. That's what you get for staring. [sighs] [fart rumbles] [sneaky music playing] [fun sexy music playing] George. You came right on time. I have a favor to ask you. Can we not have a schedule for the bathroom anymore? It's a bit cold to shower here. No. The lot area is 750 square meters, and floor area is 300 square meters. This is actually our ancestral house. First owned by my great grandparents, built in the 1930s. In short, sir, the house is old. More like historical, valuable. No matter how old this house is, it can easily be renovated. But it will cost double. See the ceiling? You need to get the whole thing fixed. This house doesn't have any value. It only looks good in pictures. -Sir, it really is beautiful. -Mm. -Look. -Oh, no, sir! Sorry, sir. Our floor is so weak, it's about to break. You are intentionally sabotaging the sale of this house. I'm not, George. I'm just saying, his money will be a waste if he buys this. That's why I'm selling it at a friendly price. Without even asking me if I'm fine with it. How about this? Sell your 50 percent, my 50 stays with me. -Do I stay here? -Don't listen to him. -I'll make sure once the house gets sold-- -My goodness. Discuss this as a married couple before selling this house! -We're not married. -Whatever! Take care, sir. Thank you. [gate opens] And you can afford to smile? That man thought we're married. [chuckles] I hate your smile. I miss your smile, George. [upbeat music plays] George, eat while it's still hot. It's to complete your morning. No, thanks. George, this is just my basic offering to you. What am I, a spirit? George, I was just going to ask permission. Can I invite my friends over? You know Bowie and my other friends, right? They're good people. Do you see me inviting my friends over? [Awee] George! Oh, my God. The line is real! -My side is the other one. -I'm so sorry. How strict. -Mikko, how are you? -That's Doc Mikko. -Doc Mikko. Congrats. -Hi! I'm Awee. It's so nice to finally meet you. -I'm George's coworker. -Ah, okay. -Hi. -Nice to meet you. What a handsome pest. So, can they come over, George? Pest? I mean, please? Come in. -I'll leave this here. -Don't cross the line. No, they're fine. George! We miss you, George! That's enough. Did you miss each other too much? We're phone pals. What did you guys talk about? You. You talk about me, George? We backstab you. -We're gossipers. -Of course, we're bashers. Yes, that was the time when you suddenly left. You guys are so harsh. Let's go through the songs. You might hear a potential hit, bro. There are also new songs we can release and debut in our label. -I also included… -Thank you. …our old band songs. I had it rearranged. Listen to it, bro. [Primo] Okay, okay. George, focus. Focus. Okay. What happens when you suffer a heart attack? Your heart becomes starved with oxygen-rich blood, and your nervous system immediately sends-- ["Pagsubok" playing] [bottle opens] George, do you remember this song? -[chuckles] -Jerk. [Mikko] Hold on, friend. That's just a test. What's with the song? During a heart attack, you'll start sweating, and your heart rate will speed up. Why, what's up? I personally won't forget this. We were playing this song when George suddenly stood up from her seat. Then what happened? You'll also feel nauseous and weak. Then she suddenly ran up the stage. -And then? -You start feeling immense chest pain that slowly crawls into your neck, jaw, ears, arms, wrists, shoulder blades, and even in your abdomen. [Axel] Then she held Primo's face. Then-- Your heart stops beating. -[Hiro] Then she suddenly kiss-- -Stop! You guys are too loud. I can't memorize. We're just making noise here in Primo's side. Even so. We still hear you. We'll just go down, George. Sorry. You don't know when to shut up. Let's go. What a miracle. Primo admitted he lost. I've long since lost after I let George go. [delicate piano music] [Axel and Hiro ] Smoothest. -Move it. -Wow. [clicks tongue] George, tell me the truth. What are these lines for? -Hmm? -For Primo. To remind him that he has boundaries. Hmm. Maybe it's for you. Why? It's not to stop Primo from coming into your life again. It's to stop you from falling for him again. Because absence makes the heart grow fonder, but presence puts the heart in danger. No. I won't fall in love with him again. [chuckles] [Awee] Hmm, really? Even if he's all you think about at night? [wind blowing] [Awee] And in a rainy, cold night, can you sleep without his warm embrace? Even if you know he's on the other side, alone, also cold, feeling lonely? And his smell that used to be your favorite scent. Can you stop yourself from wanting more? [dreamy music plays] Can you also refuse to eat your favorite grilled meal together with tomatoes and spicy vinegar on the side? Tastes good, huh? Yes. [Awee] And as the night grows deeper, can you look at him without wanting to be with him? Be honest with yourself. [indistinct chatter on TV] Stop! I just want you to be comfortable, George. [Awee] And because his extreme thoughtfulness is hard to resist, can you really ignore the spark between both of you? [George screams] [Awee] A spark that flows from your fingers to your entire body. [upbeat music plays] [music abruptly stops] [upbeat music resumes] Oh. I got scared, George. Sorry. [music abruptly stops] [upbeat music resumes] -I'm sleepy. -You are? Good night. -The lights might go out again. -Put everything back in place. Good night, George. [Awee] If your answer is yes, then you're right. You're not going to fall for him again. [gentle music plays] -George, can we talk? -No. Please, George. Just for five minutes. Please, please, George. This is important. Five minutes. [exhales] George, I've been thinking about how to tell you this because I'm scared you'd say no and ask me to leave. I'm sorry, George, but this can't wait. This is for us both. You might want to buy from me, George. I'm on the networking business. In fact, Ana's here. -[Ana] Hi, George. -Ana! Buy one. This matches your skin tone. But I think it's too light. -Um, Primo. -Hmm? Oh. Thank you ,George. Hmm. Here. Mm, what's that for? My share for our water and electricity bills. [gentle music plays] -Primo. -Hmm? You can get water from the refrigerator. Oh! This color suits you, George. Thank you. But you're even more beautiful without it. It looks nice, friend. Peppermint will suit you. He said clear looks better on me. Says who? Oh, my God. George, there you go again. Stop that, I'm telling you. Hey, but it looks good. Why are you listening to him? I'm the gay friend here. [frustrated grunt] George, -I know that story all too well. -I'll get this. Thank you. You're listening again, believing again, you're agreeing again, he's fooling you, you're being naive. Listen to me. Do not repeat the same mistake. I'm afraid you'll fall for it again. [exhales] Wow. Are we still talking about contact lenses? You're too harsh on that handsome pest. Of course. No matter how handsome a pest is, it's still a pest. [Awee] Why does Primo have to take the blame for everything? If he doesn't want to leave, then why doesn't George leave instead? Right? If it were me, and I had a pest who wouldn't leave, I won't draw a line. I would leave. Unless I really want to be around him because I missed him. [chuckles] But then again, that's just me. And I'm not you, George. Excuse me, ma'am.

[sobbing] No. [rain pattering] [thunder rumbling] [continuous sobbing] [Primo] George, come on. You'll get sick. Let's go home. Stay there. Don't move. George. George, you'll get sick. George. Damn it! There you go again. You're taking advantage of the fact that you know how to get me. Just one smile, one song, one hug, one sorry from you, and my world starts turning again. Damn, Primo! I'm a smart person. But when it comes to you, I don't know why I become stupid. What will be the consequence if I get back with you again? My world will stop again for you? How many years of my life will I waste again? Do you remember Mikko? He's about to become a doctor. And Jessica? She's happily married. Me? Look at me. Still trying to put my life back and regain everything I lost when you left me. [gentle music plays] George, I'm sorry. And what makes that sorry different from all your other sorrys before? I gave you almost seven years of my life, Primo. And in those seven years, it was just that one time I told you I was tired. [continuous sobbing] Only once did I ask myself if I could still fight. Only once did I have the courage to tell you how I felt. That I was hurting, that I was losing myself. Just one time, in the many times I could have given up, but I didn't. But then you only needed one time to give up on us. To leave and not come back. I needed you to fight for us that night. George. Because I was so tired, fighting alone. To fight, that even if I tell you to leave, you wouldn't. Because you know me. I just said all that because I was tired. But I love you. Jo, I love you, too. I still love you, Jo. But that one time I got tired, you chose to leave me. Is that how you love, Primo? Hmm? How could you give up so easily? How did you not find a reason to stay? I will never allow you to consume me again. Once the rain stops and I come back, I want you gone.| I will just get in touch with you if I need you to sign papers when the house gets sold. [rain pattering] What if it takes a year for the rain to stop? Then he's lucky. But admit it, you're proud of me. I'm not stupid anymore. But you're not happy. [chuckles] [sniffles] You know, I don't get you. If I use my heart, you'll tell me I'm stupid. If I use my head, I'm unhappy. [chuckles] You really can't be happy. So we're a tie, okay? That way, I won't get jealous of you anymore. -What? -[chuckles] It's me who's jealous of you. -You're a doctor now. -Hmm. I'm still a nobody. Well, I don't get a hug from my diploma at night. [both chuckle] I've always been jealous of you because every time I'd see you hurting, I'd feel I was missing out on something that matters more. [laughs] Because I don't have that. I guess the grass is always greener on the other side. It all depends where you choose to look. -[crickets chirping] -[rain pattering] [gentle music plays] [birds chirping] [motorcycle revving] [delicate piano theme plays] Mom? George, where were you? Why did you leave your phone? Good thing Primo was there. Uh, George, sorry I answered the call. Auntie's call felt like an emergency. She called really late. Yohan wouldn't stop crying, and he panicked. -I couldn't help but panic, too. -What happened? He said he woke up with dark vision. He also sees ribbons of blood. It only means the blood vessels in his retina have ruptured. And it is caused by his fluctuating blood sugar level. So, what's next, doc? We have to take a series of tests so we can assess what kind of treatments we can give to delay his loss of vision. Delay? Not cure? Yes. Because diabetic retinopathy is incurable. We can just go here from time to time, George. Mom, it's better if you're closer to the hospital. I don't want a repeat of what happened earlier. What's this? North and South Korea? What? I see. All right. Oh, gosh. Hi, auntie. Yohan, change your clothes! This kid. [crickets chirping] Thank you. No problem, George. [breathes deeply] Uh, George, I know that… I should be gone once the rain stops. But, can I extend? I wanna stay. Just until the house gets sold. You're agreeing to sell the house? Yohan needs it. [gentle piano music] [inhales deeply] Thank you. Don't worry, George. I won't ask for an us anymore. And I'll give you the space you want. But now, George, I just really want to help. I promise, once this is all over, [gentle music rises] I will be gone from your life. [Baby] Yohan, you're getting on my nerves. All you talk about is Amsterdam. Amsterdam here, there. Damn that Amsterdam! I'm about to go blind and I still haven't seen my father. [Baby sighs] George, you promised you'd bring me to Dad, right? See, George? You keep promising things to your brother. We don't even know if he's really there. I already told you that he's dead! He's dead. He's gone! You act as if you'll die if you don't see him. Mom, what's wrong with wanting to see Dad? Why do you have to go see that fool? He left us! Why do you have to insist on being part of his life? Mom. Mom. Mom, we're not gonna leave you. We're not gonna stay there. It's just frustrating to not know what Dad looks like when I'm about to go blind. That's why we're going to get you treated. But we're not sure if it will be successful, right? Yohan, I'm gonna keep my promise. But I don't have enough savings right now. [sniffles] The money we'll get from this house, we'll use that for your treatment. Hmm? I hope you understand. [vendor] Soy bean custard! [George grunts, exhales] [woman] How old is this house? Not many people know this, but this house is almost a hundred years old. It's one of the first houses that was built here. But why did Bowie say this house is still sturdy? Yes, ma'am. Sir, as you can see, the house is not too big, but it's spacious. -It's open and cozy. -There's a lot to be fixed. [boy screams] -Hey! My god! -Hey! [man] It's not safe here. There are no grills. Your grandkids are too frisky. We have two… two rooms. Don't mind the mess. We made it into a storage room. Wow. Are these included? -Um-- -That's not for sale. -Here's Incredible Prime. -[chuckles] -Oops. -And this is our dining. Kinda like the vibe, dude. Where did you find these people, George? They walked in at the site. They're looking for an old house. The windows are too big. I know. This is not it. This house may be old, but it still looks beautiful, just like you. Does it flood here? Is this earthquake proof? Does it have a firewall? When was the last inspection report? I mean, the roof, the ceiling. It might get flooded even with little rain. Is this house even insured? What I mean is, if anything happens-- Hi, ma'am. Good morning. I'm George, also the owner of this house. This house was built on solid grounds and-- Ah, ah, ah, ah. You're not answering my questions. Mrs. Abellera, honestly, this house has nothing. This house doesn't have those. The only thing our house has is history. And that's priceless. When you get to the point where you have nothing, you're left with just the memories that won't ever… get replaced, that won't ever get erased. I like this house. Thank you. Mrs. Abellera, do you mean--? Want me to give you the earnest money right now? -Yes. -Woo-hoo! Yes! -Thank you. Thank you, ma'am. -Oh, sorry. [laughing] Thank you. [record player playing] -Mom? -[Baby] Yes? -Move! Let me through! -Mom, get off. -I tried looking-- -Let's play this. Yohan, Mom! We're not included in your lines deal. No, Mom, that might be Primo's. He'll get mad. This? No, this is your grandma's. Primo got all his records when you left. Where is he bringing them? Ask him yourself. There, let's play this first. -[Primo] Auntie, Yohan. -[Baby] Hmm? -I bought them! -[Yohan] Yes! -You did it. Thank you. -[Baby chuckling] -No problem. No problem, Yohan. -Awesome. Wow. What's going on here? Primo bought us tickets. Where did you--? [sweet music plays] What about Incredible Prime? [chuckles] Uh… he didn't transform anymore. He's now a normal citizen who wants you and Yohan to see your father. [sweet music rises] [George] Thank you. George, you crossed the line. [George] Hmm? I don't see any lines. -Oh, right. -[all chuckle] What? Visa time? -Visa time! Let's go! -Okay. Mom, are you ready to see Dad again? Ready? Yes, I was ready 15 years ago. But now, I might bang this onto his head. So, it's just me and Yohan? And Primo. He knows someone there, right? Yes, auntie. Amsterdam, here we come! [upbeat music soars] [Darwin] Yo! Cousin! -Dude! -How are you? -Give me a kiss. -Hey! [both chuckle] -Doctor, how are you? -Not yet. Almost a doctor. Almost? Oh, right. -Let's go, almost cousin. -[house owner] Enjoy your stay. -Thank you very much. -Bye-bye. Time to go. Thank you. Bye. -Hello. -Hello. -Let's go? -Let's go. -Hey, Primo. -Hmm? Our friends are asking if you can pass by Rome before you go back home. They miss you and they miss playing music with you. Tell them no. I'll be there soon anyway. Uh, I thought-- Let's go to bed. Uh, George, good night. Yohan, go to bed. I'll wake you up early tomorrow. -Thanks, Primo. -All right. Are you and Primo really breaking up after this? We've been broken up, remember? [bittersweet music playing] Yohan, looks like we're almost there. -Are you excited? -I really am. This is it. George, if you see Dad, would you recognize him? -Uh, maybe. I hope so. -[chuckles] I was just a kid then. He left after you were born. Then Mom ruined all of his pictures. Harsh. But I'm sure he's about your height. -Okay. -His stance is like a soldier. His complexion's pale to rosy. -And his hair is-- -[Yohan] It's black, right? -Not blonde, right? -Yes, it's black, with a military cut. His eyes has a color. It's like-- -[Yohan] Are they blue? -[George] Yes. That for sure we didn't inherit. This is the house. We're looking for Mr. Gregory Silva. [clicks tongue] Uh, and you are? We're your children. Wait. I'm not Gregory. [speaking in Dutch] [continues speaking in Dutch] Oh, sorry. Um, he said your father moved to his wife's place. Wife? George, Dad has another family? Uh, yeah, can I give you my number, uh, just in case you hear back from him? -[man] Yes. -[Yohan] Maybe that's why he left us. Because he has another family. Do you think Mom knows? I don't know. We shouldn't have gone here in the first place. But I still want to see him. What's the point? They might think we're causing trouble. They might hate us. Whether or not he has a family, whether or not they hate us, I still wanna see him, even just for a little while, before I go-- Shh! Shh! Shh! [upbeat music plays] Okay. Okay, okay, okay. We'll find him. Thank you, George. I'll ask over there. -Hello, sir. Good day. -Hi. -Are you Filipino? -Can I ask you a question? -Would you know a Gregory Silva? -Gregory Silva? No. -George, Primo! Primo! -Thank you. -Yes? -My boss called me. He has a contact who can help us, but I need to go to see him in the office. No, we're coming with you. No need. This might not work again. It's better if we separate so we can accomplish more. -And here. -He's right. -Here. Text me. -Okay. Thank you. -All right, Dar. Take care. -Thank you. -So, let's find him? -Let's go. [upbeat music continues] [George] Excuse me. Um, do you know anyone named Gregory Silva? [man] Gregory Silva? No. I'm sorry. [George, Primo] Thank you. -[Yohan breathing heavily] -[George] Yohan. -You okay? Tired? -George. I'm fine, Primo. But can we sit first? You wanna sit first? Okay. -You want to see Dad, right? -Yes, badly. Should we call it a day? -No, I'm okay. I'm okay. -Sure? -Yeah. -Okay. [George] It's so beautiful here in Amsterdam. Mm-hmm. But-- [Yohan] You're not together anymore. What? It's true. Why do you have to put a period to it? Why not put a comma or an ellipsis? [phone ringing] Hello, Dar. Okay, okay. Okay, Dar. Thank you. Bye-bye. What did he say? -He has good news. Yohan, let's go. -What? Okay. -There he is! Guys. -Where? -Dar! -Yo, guys. Did you find our dad? -Are we going to him now? -Are you sure? Hmm. [clicks tongue] It's just that-- -What's wrong? -I'm sure. [chuckles] -Thank you, Dar! Thank you! -No problem! -Let's go then! -Wait. We'll go to him tomorrow. [Yohan sighs] We should go now. Let's not waste the day. Then we won't. Let's go around. -Right. -What do you want to do? I wanna ride a boat, I wanna ride a bike, I wanna go to a museum, but first things first, let's eat. -Mm. He's hungry. Okay. -[chuckles] Since Yohan has many activities in mind, -best if we start. -Come. -Let's go. -Ready? Okay? Go, go. -Come on, George. -Hurry up. -[Yohan] Beautiful. -[Darwin] This is a museum. Uh, it's called Rijksmuseum, dedicated to history and arts. This place was made for Primo. Anyone can sing here. Come here, look. -Someone's playing. -Musicians play here. ♪ Lights, diamonds, roses ♪ ♪ Diamond home ♪ [crowd cheering] It's open jam tonight, guys. Who wants to jam--? My cousin! He's a great musician. -Dar, I don't wanna do it. -Don't be shy. Do it. I don't want to. Go, Primo. This is your chance. Bring Filipino music to the world. -[Yohan] Whoo! -[crowd cheering] -Hey. -What do you play? [Primo] Uh, I play the guitar. All right. [chuckles] Okay, um… [exhales] Uh… I'm going to sing an original Filipino song. Is that okay? -[Darwin] Yeah, sounds great. -[woman] Yeah, yeah. Okay. [chuckles] Well, I hope you like it.

[gentle music plays] Your father and my daughter, they had an accident two years ago. We really wanted to tell you, but we didn't know how to reach you. My gosh. You really have your father's nose. [woman chuckles] You… You lost all your baby fat. He used to tell us that you were the most big baby he had ever seen. -He talked about us? -Yes, he did. Always. [woman] Yeah, yes. He said when we have enough money, we'll go to the Philippines. Then I'll meet there my smartest sister and my cutest brother. [woman] Yeah. [woman] It's so sad that he couldn't fulfill his promise. I hope you both can forgive him for that. [Yohan sniffles] [delicate music plays] [birds chirping] Are you okay? No, wrong question. Are you okay now? [chuckles] No, George. Just very, very, very okay. -Do you know that feeling? -Okay! That's an overreaction. Of course, I saw my dad. Even if only in a picture. -Plus, we saw our brother also. -Mm-hmm. How about you, George? Are you okay? Mm-hmm. I'm very, very, okay, too. Primo, Darwin, are you guys okay? -Of course. -Yes, we are. Hold on. I'm actually not that okay. -Oh? -Darwin, I wanna see tulips. What? You wanna see tulips? [chuckles] Not for me but for my sister. No need. I'm okay. Don't worry about me, Yohan. No, George. You showed me everything I wanted to see. There's only one thing left I want to see. To see you happy. [gentle piano music plays] I am happy. We saw our brother. You can be happier than that. Okay? Darwin, it's her favorite flower. Then let's go find some. We might get home late. [Darwin] It's not far, George. Great. Let's go. But my feet hurt. -Um, Darwin? -[Darwin] Yes? [Yohan] Your feet hurt, too, right? Oh, right. My feet hurt, too. -Even my waist hurts. -Right. You two can go. Primo, promise. -[Yohan] You guys go. -Go ahead. -[Darwin grunts] -[George scoffs] [Darwin] Go. Hurry up. Don't just stand there. Go! -Excuse me, sir. -Yes? Where are the tulips? Well, there are no tulips now. You're out of season. It's summer at the moment. In April, we have a beautiful field of tulips. [birds chirping] It's really not meant to be. Right. George, look at this. [gentle piano music] Oh, see? Maybe not tulips but beautiful nevertheless. Sometimes, even if you don't get what you dreamed of, it will still be given to you in another way. You wouldn't have said that before. Hmm? Mm-hmm. Tell me I'm wrong. Before, you'd get everything you want. "Getting it is the only option." How proud, huh? Uh, yes. [chuckles] -Even my fart was proud. -Mm-hmm. -[chuckles] -And, you know, George, those were the only things in my pocket when I went to Italy. Arrogance and anger. I wanted to show you what you've lost. Good thing you let me go. It's gone anyway. Nothing happened. I became no one. I lost everything. And I couldn't go home because… I didn't have the guts to face you. You know, George, I was so ashamed of myself then that one day, I thought of ending everything. And then I saw the sunset. Damn that sunset, George. I was moved. Because that was me. Slowly sinking, slowly disappearing, slowly ending. But when I woke up, the sun was there again, shining bright as ever. Then, dang, I realized something. The sun might set now, but tomorrow, it'll rise again. Wait for it. Be patient. Just ride the tide until the sun rises again. Because it always does. And when it does, and you're still open to everything, you're in for a lot of surprises. [gentle music soaring] Like, you weren't able to sing, but you know how to write songs. Mm-hmm. I had a hard time at work, but I was able to get past it. I even nearly got promoted. From cleaning bathrooms, to cleaning bedrooms. [chuckles] We broke up, but at least you were able to be with your family. You had time to take care of your dad. But I lost you. But we became better persons, didn't we? George, I may not have found a reason to stay, but I found a reason to come back. [phone ringing] Mrs. Abellera had to ruin the moment. [both chuckle] George, they will move in once we get back. Great! At least we'll be able to get the full payment. Woo-hoo! Yohan finally has money for treatment. You can also start med school. You can also start whatever business you want. [Primo] Our time's up as well. Sometimes I think, what if we held on and rode the tide together? Will we also get to where we are now? ["Dalawang Tao" playing] George, how much is this? Thanks, dude.

[gentle music slowly creeping in] [Primo] Happy birthday, Jo. I'm sorry that I can only give you Tita Lola's old record. Sorry, this is all I can afford. No rush. It's okay. I hope you can save your relationship. -Thank you. -If you need anything, tell us. [Primo] I know that lately, I've been falling short of the man I promised I'd become, the man you deserve. Dad, I'm not belittling what you do. That's just really not my passion. Passion? Will that passion feed you? Your engineer brother, he works as a gardener and waiter here. Your mom and I are domestic helpers, but we're fine. At least we're earning money. And George still feeds you up until now. [Primo] You know what, Dad? I would rather starve than go there. I would rather die than do something I don't want to do! [Primo] George, I see how much you're suffering, how much you're hurting, and it crushes me. Primo, I'm sorry. [Primo] But I can't do anything. Because the truth is, I don't know how anymore. How do I start all over again? How do I fulfill all of our dreams? George, no. Don't. [Primo] How do I keep my promises to you? Jo, don't give up on us. Don't let go. Help me in finding out the answers to all the how's until we win this fight. I can't imagine my life without you. I didn't know you kept that. Two years too late.

Although, Jo, thinking about it now, we have only won a battle, not the war. [man] Ma'am, where do you want to put this? Wherever. Just make sure to take care of my plants. Wait. I'm confused. No, auntie. My Tita Lola told me that forever is like a war. It will take a long time, it will hurt. Full of little battles. Like when George and I broke up. We might have lost a battle, but we emerged victorious, because we became better people. Right, George? Yes. Because in order to win a war-- You have to stay together. You don't win a war by fighting each other, you win by fighting together. But in the first place, there should be no war to win, only a journey to go through. It's easier to give up when it hurts, to leave when it gets tiring, but what you really need is patience. If you only held on, you would still learn those things. You would still grow together. Oh, look at my plants. Some plants, they need space to grow. And some, they grow better together. [both laugh] [Primo] Take care of our house. Yes. Yes, promise. I'll take care of this house. Our house. I promise.
