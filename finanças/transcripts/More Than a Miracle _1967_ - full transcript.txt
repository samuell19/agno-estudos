Ah! Aah! Whoa! Whoa! Come on, quiet! Whoa, boy! Whoa! Come back. Keep quiet! Oh! Quiet boy! Whoa! Quiet, quiet, boy. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Hey! Hey! When will you stop it, my son? When will you stop risking your life for the sake of a horse? Fight battles that would be of some use to the family. Instead of taming wild horses, get married and tame a wife. 'Seven princesses are waiting for you.' 'And the preparations for a tournament' 'are not enough to justify your bad manners.' 'It's time you gave new life to this line of proud Spaniards' 'of which your father was the head.' 'At least come and take a look of them.' 'They're handsome..' An order that you should marry has been sent by our king. The king of Spain. Tell the king that I don't need him to find a wife. That is not an acceptable answer. Find another. Pablo! Keep away! Hup! Whoa! The gates! Hey! Hey! Aah! Hyah! Whoa! Whoa! Aah! Whoa! Yeah! Hoo! Whoa! Whoa! Now it's gonna go for a miracle. You have been up there an hour! 'It's bad for your health!' Are you comingdown, Robert Joseph, yes or no? 'Robert Joseph!' Robert Joseph, please don't make me go on shouting! It could make you come down with a jolt and break your neck! Come here! Come here! Round we go! Hey, easy, easy! Not so fast. Alright now, round the other way. Uh! Shh. Shh. Quiet, quiet! Uh, what are you looking for? My horse. Are you sure, huh? Yes. Off you go. Go on! Go on! Off you go. Go on! Go on! What are you doing, children? Ah, my son, God's ways are not our ways. Today you have lost something so that perhaps tomorrow you will find something else. - Robert Joseph! - Alright! - I'm coming. - Time to feed the chickens. - I'm coming. - Here. - Here you are. - Here we are. Shut your noise, shut your noise! Hey, chick-chick-chick! Hey, chick, go on! Go on, eat. Hey, chick-chick-chick. Hereyou are! Hey, chick-chick-chick! Hey, chick! Hey, chick-chick-chick! Brother, what did you say before? I need nothing but my horse. That's what you think. What do I need then? Tell me. So many things. A wife, for example. You too want me married? No, it's not that, my son, but you see.. ...it'll not be easy for you to make the decision. 'Cause the women you'll love will have an impossible character. Just like yours. I do what I want to do, always. It's my custom. Always? Get down! They're not ready. Don't be so impatient. Stop it. The buns are not ready yet, I tell you! Ooh! 'Hands off that sugar!' Here, take this flour. And we shall see if you can always do what you want to do. Now, when you're hungry you ask someone to make you seven dumplings. And if you're able to eat all seven I'll admit I was wrong. Tomazo, Antonio. What's so difficult about eating seven dumplings? It's difficult. It's difficult. Hey, go on, children. Put that saddle on Serafina. Come along, my friend. You may have a long journey. You can borrow Serafina. Uh, when you don't need him anymore, just give him a pat. He'll find his own way home. Eeh! Whoa! Heh heh heh. 'Oh, don't forget..' '...you must eat all seven.' Come on. Come on, there he is. Come on, come on. Come on, Serafina. My horse! Hey! That's my horse! How can it be yours? Can't you see that this a nobleman's horse? And what makes you think you're a nobleman? I am the prince. Ruler of all this land. As far as the eye can see. Hmm, and I am Isabella of Spain. You're a common little thief and I ought to have you punished. Take that filthy rubbish off my horse and load it on the donkey which you can keep as a present from your prince. A very good present, after you've taken my horse. Uh! Uh! Have you ever seen a donkey with an Arab saddle? That saddle is stolen. You're a thief. That's all you Spaniards can do. Steal from people who work. Hey! What are you doing? Take your hands off that.. Whoa! Whoa! I said, it wasn't your horse. He doesn't know you. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Quiet, boy. Serafina, get back to the monastery! But you said I could have the donkey. It's not mine to give. You gave it to me before. Before was before. Put that stuff back on the horse. I'll come with you. No. Shh, those are the princes' men. - 'That way.' - Huh! Huh! They're searching for his horse. And you're afraid of them. You are a thief! Hey! What.. What are you doing? Shh! Shh! Do you know what the Spaniards do to thieves when they catch them? First they cut off their ears and their nose. You're the thief. You deserve it. No. Uh! Aah, aah! Leave me alone. You'll hang! Go away. I don't want anyone to see you hanging about in front of my home. Then let me in. Never. Psst. Take this flour, make me seven dumplings. There's no water. I'll get you some. Give me a pot to put it in. Anything to get rid of you. Here. - Here's the water. - Ah. Take the pan, take anything, only go away. I asked you to make me seven dumplings. Eh, so? How many did you make? Seven. - Can you count? - Uh. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. One, two, three, four, five, and six. Six or seven, what difference does it make? Eat them and go away, and if you don't I'll eat them myself. It makes a lot of difference. Where's the seventh dumpling? I don't know. The chicken must've had it. Where's the seventh dumpling? I don't know! Look, what do you want from me? First the horse, now the dumpling. I'm tired of you following me about. You must give me the seventh dumpling.. ...or I die. Die, then! I've killed him. Hey, you. Come on. Come on, get up. Get up! Please. Please, say some thing. Where's the dumpling? You're just trying to make a fool of me. Two can play that game. Quickly, out everybody! The Spaniard died in front of my house. Hey, come! Come on! Come out. The Spaniard's dead in front of my house. Now, it's too late to move. These are nasty people. If they found you alive, they'll cut you to pieces now that they know you're a Spaniard. A Spaniard! Who could've killed him? - What are we going to do? - Oh, no! What happened here? Why did you kill him? - We have to hide his body. - Yes! We have to hurry and hide him. They'll burn the whole village to the ground. Bury him before the Spaniards come. Get those rings. Cut off his rings. Hey, what are you doing? Hey! I warned you, they'll cut you to pieces. Where's the seventh dumpling? What are you going to do with him? We can't let the Spaniards find him. Come on! There's no time! Hurry! Come on! Hurry! Oh, my god! What are we going to do? Make it as deep as you can. You women, lock yourselves inside your houses and take all the children. Come on! Where's Antonio? You can't let them bury you just for a dumpling. Why not? Help me lift him. Come on. Cover him up with those branches. Cover him with those branches. Hurry! More branches. Everyone to his house and bolt the doors and windows. Hurry, or the Spaniards will burn down the whole village. Isabella! Isabella! For a little dumpling you've lost yourself a prince. What makes you think he was a prince? I'm old and I know a thing or two. Isabella, it's character that helps form our destiny. And you've got a horrible character. That's not true. I ate the dumpling, that's all. So, you got the dumpling. A bad noggin. Where is he now? And how would I know? Tonight is not like other nights. Perhaps there is someone who knows. But who? Where? Wait! I want to know where he is now. I'll come with you. Here we are. Now, come along, Isabella, come along. Wait. And don't you name the Madonna. What? The Madonna? Don't you speak her name, or they won't help you. Remember now I warned you. Don't speak of God or Madonna, do you understand? Alright. You're a little afraid. No. Now, you wait here. The poor thing, she's a little afraid.. ...of all the witches. But she's a good girl, and I think I'll help her. I won't let her come to any harm. Where've you been? We've been waiting for you. Put it here! Go on! Go! Isabella, here. They're already waiting for you. Draw yourself a circle. And don't move out of it. We knew you'll come to us. What's the matter with the little one? What does she want? What do you want to know? If it's true that he loves me. He did. Did? And doesn't anymore? Love's like the wind. Comes, goes. She ought to know that. Then make it come back. Cast a spell. How would you try to win a man back? Tip of your tongue in the keyhole of a lock. 'Stop, Isabella, stop!' What are you telling her? Tip of the tongue in the keyhole of a lock will paralyze him. There's only one way to bring a man back. Three turns round a stone.. ...one step forward, half a step back. - 'No, no, no!' - Yes, yes, yes. This is the way it goes. Lovely love.. ...blunder my hearts. We'll keep together till death do us part. The tip of your tongue in the keyhole of a lock. - Against the faces of a rock! - Don't listen to her! Quiet! - I see him. - Stop! He's at the convent of Kapucini nuns. Yes! Now, I see him. 'How wet the poor prince is.' 'Look how tired and hungry.' 'Plenty of dishes, not much to eat.' 'Three radishes, a little piece of cheese.' 'A bite of bread.' Aah! Oh, Madonna! What shall I do? What did she say? Three turns around a stone.. Three turns around a stone.. ...one step forward, then, half a step back. Yes. But which stone? What did the other one say? Ah! Put the tip of your tongue in the keyhole of a lock. What is it? What's happened? Holy Mother of God, what's wrong? He doesn't move. Oh, are you feeling ill? - He's paralyzed. - Paralyzed? How did it happen? What's all the commotion? What's going on? - He's paralyzed. - Oh, Mother of God! - He can't move. - Take him to bed. Holy Mary, Mother of God help this man lying paralyzed here all night. Salvatore, come here. We won't hurt you. - Come here, I said. - Come here. Oh, you're a bad little boy. You'll come to no good. I'll check around that way. Come here, we won't hurt you. I got you. Mother Superior will be furious. Oh, you finally got him. Here. Show us what a brave little boy you can be or your father will be sacked by the Mother Superior. Pss pss pss. Is he finished? Finished? Finished? He's finishing. He's finishing? Oh, he's finished, thanks be to God. - He did it. We're saved. - Oh, thank heaven, we're saved. - We're saved! - Thanks be to God. Here, take it. Oh, we're saved. For your evils there's a cure! Drink this spirit of the pure. You will jump, and run, and dance. 'Swallow now, or lose your chance.' This is a spell brought by women. She who charmed you, must with a kiss disarm you. Now, you listen to him. 'Drink it. Drink it.' The Spanish soldiers are coming. Into the church. Into the church, everyone. Inside! Into the church, quickly. You can't bring a donkey into the church, go away! Go away! Inside, everyone! Come on, hurry, hurry. It's all your fault. - You killed the Spaniard. - Yes, she killed him. That's not true, he's alive. They're coming to fetch the ring you stole. That's right, you stole the Spaniard's ring. Make him give it back to the soldiers or they'll kill every one of us. 'Make him give back the ring.' No! It's mine! It's mine! Alright, take the ring. Take it! 'Give the ring to Isabella.' 'Make her give it to the Spaniard.' 'Make Isabella take it to the soldiers.' Take it to the soldiers. I don't want to. No! No! Make her go outside of the church! Outside! I don't want to. Don't throw me out. No! - Now, what's going on here? - You take it. Put it in front of the Madonna, let them find it there. It's sacrilege. Stolen property. You can't let them chase me out of God's house. Everywhere is God's house. Tie yourself to the door. It's the same thing, my child. Please let me in! Let me in! 'Open the door in the name of Prince Rodrigo Fernandez.' His highness Prince Rodrigo has come to see Isabella Candeloro. He's come back. That's her! That's Isabella. Into the yard! All of you! Prince! Make way for the Prince! Are you Isabella Candeloro? Yes. Then come with me. First you must bow and then you must kiss His Highness. - Kiss his hand? - No. Kiss his lips. In front of everybody? Make them look away. I'm ashamed. Captain, have them all face the mountains. Everyone face the mountains. Face the mountains! - Face the mountains! - Face the mountains! All of you face the mountains. Come, my dear. Aah! The ring, sire. Get down! Faces in the dirt! Face in the dirt, you too, priest. Faces in the dirt. 'Look up.' Look at me. Thieves and murderers, the lot of you. Face in the dirt, you too. Look at me. Have you ever been with the devil? Then perhaps you'll think some good angel's watching over you. What's the name of this good angel? My guardian angel. And was it your guardian angel who helped you put a curse on me? - No. - Then it was the devil. No. Who then? The old women. Witches. I did it wrong. I didn't want to hurt you. I love you. 'Face in the dirt.' My knee's hurting me. Put your face in the dirt. Brave little men, aren't you? Stand up! Stand up! Don't! Keep away! Away! I'm ashamed of you. Stand up! Stand up! If a single one of you dares to move I'll give the order to shoot. You, too! You're very good at shouting. But you've got the guts of a rabbit. The barrel. You could stick me in a barrel but that won't get you far. I'm not going to die to please you. I've got nine lives like a cat. You didn't even have the guts to do it with your own hands. 'One doesn't kill a witch. Witches are put in a barrel.' She will stay there for five days. On bread and water. And God help anyone who tries to help her. Afterwards bring her to my palace. Isabella, they put you in a barrel, huh? - 'The barrel!' - 'The barrel!' 'After it!' Oh, Isabella, good luck. 'Let's go. Come on.' - Push. - Push. - Roll it this way. - Push harder. - Hey, watch my feet. - Push it, come on. Come on. Roll it this way. - What's in it? - 'Hey, let's break it open.' - 'With what?' - 'There. There's an opening.' - 'Go on, push.' - 'Look.' Hey, there's a girl inside. Come on, let's break it open. Come on, get some of those rocks. - Take off the staves. - The bottom's he's gotta get. - Try with a rock. - There you go. Easy. Hey, why is she here? Who is she? 'She must be a thief or a witch.' It's thieves they put in barrels. - Witches too. - She's too pretty. - Witches are old and ugly. - 'She doesn't move.' She's dead. - She's alive! - Let's go! I'm gonna have a look. It's salty. You're pretty stupid. Didn't you know that sea water was salty? Who's ever seen the sea? Ha! You're not only not a witch, you're also stupid. Hey, come here. Come on. Who are you? Who put you in there? - The prince. - Why? Hey. Princes are no good. My prince is worse than all of them. Princes are not men, they're princes. What are princes anyway? What do they do? They ride their horses. - And they eat. - How much they eat. They're having a big tournament with lots of horses and flags. And after, they'll have a big dinner to celebrate. We're invited too. I see. You think maybe she can help us? If you wanna come with us, we'll take you along. But you gotta give us a hand. Good luck, sire. - Now don't be long. - Wait here. 'I declare the tournament between our Christian prince' 'and the Moorish prince open.' Come on, hurry. - And you? - Go, go, hurry. Good luck. Goodbye. The trouble with Prince Rodrigo is that he's too predictable. He makes a habit of winning our tournament every year. However there's one surprise he might still have in store for us. And he should realize that experience in diplomacy won't allow us to wait any longer. There are seven principalities in our realm which our king holds most dear. And seven are the princesses' who owe allegiance to him. You will offer this on the part of the king to your chosen bride, whom you will have the grace to present to us within... seven days. - Rodrigo! Splendid riding! - You were magnificent, Rodrigo. You're marvelous, Rodrigo! O ye, O ye, O ye. For the seven-day celebration in honor of the seven princesses that any man or woman who so desires present himself or herself to Monsieur Jean-Jacques Bouche, known as Monzu 'of the fair land of France' chef of the kitchens of His Highness Prince Rodrigo Fernandez Davalos 'to be chosen as scallion and dishwasher.' Isabella? Isabella? - What is it? - Go on. Go work for the cook. Go on. - Me? - 'Yes.' Well, go on, Isabella. That's right. Go on, go on. 'O ye, O ye, O ye.' 'For the seventh day celebration' 'in honor of the seven princesses..' - Three thousand. - Yes, excellence. Pigs, yes. Five thousand. Come, kitchen lads, four dozen. Who's he? Monzu? Yes, that crazy Frenchmen wants an omelet with 3000 eggs. You, you, you, you. You, you, you, you, you. - You, you, you, you, you. - Me! Me! Me! You. Me! Me! Me! I made you responsible for that young woman not those drunken soldiers. Of course, yes. Ah! Your flesh is too sour for this dog to feed on. If you don't find that barrel with it's precious contents you'll end up as food for my griffin. - Search everywhere. - Yes, sire. - The rivers. - Rivers. - The seashores. - Seashores. - Even the oceans. - Oceans. Hey, you! Have you ever seen the prince who's getting married? And who are we to see someone like that? Did you ever hear of a prince coming to visit the kitchen? Is it possible no one knows where I could see him? I hear that he's handsome. Really handsome, they say. Four drops of weed candy. One, two, three, four. Three drops of.. Oh! Oh! Isabella, bella, bella, bella, bella. Isabella, bella, bella, bella, bella. Bella, Isabella, you'll see, Isabella. Just you wait and see, Isabella. Wait and see, Isabella. Just you wait, Isabella, we'll show them. We'll show them. We'll show them. Seven of the most beautiful princesses await your pleasure and you won't glance at them. You won't dare to speak to them. And now you tell me that you refuse to sit at the same table. What's wrong with them? Have they got the plague? Where are you going now? Where I will. Stable boy, saddle my horse. What's all this disgusting muck? Throw it away. The dinner is cancelled. You've already cancelled six dinners. Don't forget the kings command. Tomorrow is the last day. Tonight you must decide your future. No. You can decide for me. It's much better. Go on, do what you like. I'm quite indifferent. Disgusting muck? 'Disgusting muck!' 'No dinner.' Shh! I want to hear what's going on. Oh! That'sMonsieurJacques again, he's always shouting. Pay no attention to him. He's mad. We can't waste our time listening to him. We've got more than enough work to do. If we don't hurry, we'll never finish with these eggs. Oh, I've never seen so many eggs before. Ooh! Would you just look at it? It's a little baby chick. Look! Come here! Come here! Look how pretty. Oh! Look this sweet thing is trying to get out and it can't. Oh, look, look, its fell. Now what are we going to do? ThatMonsieurJacques will go out of his mind. 'His omelet with 3000 eggs.' What are you going to do? Can't you see he's out of his mind? Dig a hole in the ground.. ...and bury this dinner. With full honors. - Hey, Monzu? - Hmm. Instead of throwing it away, why don't we eat it, huh? You.. ...you eat my penne? My? My pate? My? How ugly can you get? Get to work. Fill the flour sacks. 'Chickens? Chickens!' 'Look, get some more baskets.' I got you. Where were you off to? Hmm? 'Alright!' Eh, what's all the banging? What is it? I want to speak to the monk that flies. Dear brother, those who fly, fly away. They say goodbye to us and fly off to paradise. He's dead? You meant like an angel. Yesterday morning, at this hour. First he called for a little drink of water then he looked at each of us and closed his eyes. He gave me some flour. You can keep it then. There's no shortage of flour here besides if he gave it to you he was certainly thinking of something. Who can say what had passed through his mind. Things that only a saint could've known about. He was a holy man. For me, better than Saint Francis. Hmm. Both talk to animals, but ours could fly. You want to see him? 'What you doing here?' You know that this is not your place. Come with me. I like horses. 'Georgie.' You give little Georgie kick. Little Georgie how happy you give him kick. Look at your face. Look. This is flour. Who gets flour in my princes' room? Look, look here, more flour. How gets this flour in my princes' room? You wait here. No. I don't trust you. Then why did you leave that trail of flour? Because I wanted to see how honest you were. You've got seven beautiful princesses waiting for you. Tomorrow you'll marry one of them. What do you want with me? You're right, I am dishonest. And you've got the nerve to say it. Not to say it. To be it. Get out or I'll kill you! You're vain... ignorant and disobedient. It won't work. I know what you're thinking, but it won't work. And what are you doing in my house? - I wash your dishes. - And I'm your master! But you can't trick me. Can you wash dishes well? That's what I'm doing here. - You never break them? - No. Would it matter? Tomorrow you'll wash more dishes 'than you've ever washed before in your life.' God help you if you break a single one. His Highness commands the chef to have all the plates slippery and greasy. This is an order. No, no, no. Well.. After this... I'm off. The world has gone mad! He's turning this palace into a slum. Boom. Simone. Cheese. - Tomato sauce. - At last. Ashes. Quick, come with me. "Donna Eugenia Colonari princess of .." Tomato sauce. "Donna Eugenia Colonaru princess of.. Table number one." Cheese. '"Donna Mafalda--"' How revolting. '"Donna Olimpia Capce Latro Princess of Altamura.' 'Table number two."' Sorry. Come along. Princess... Donna Eugenia. Would you come this way? This way, please. Yes, Your Highness. This way table number one. Princess. '"Donna.."' "Princess of Crizonia." Table number eight, please, princess. Table number five, this way, princess. "Donna Di Anante.." 'Princess of Pacaro, table number seven."' She's the most beautiful of all, worthy of being a queen. '"Princess of Acha Novea, table number six."' - Senor Carpaccio. - Your Highness. Yes? - Chamberlain. - Yes, Excellency. "Donna Isabella Candeloro, Prin-Princess of Carcaloro. 'Donna Isabella Candeloro, Princess of Carcaloro."' '"Donna Isabella Candeloro, Princess of Carcaloro.' 'Table number three."' Please... where's number three? As you go down to your right. Where's my right? With what hand do you cross yourself? Never. I will never take part in a competition.. ...to which at the last moment that common creature has been admitted. Ooh! Ah, ah, ah. Invented by you tonight. A princess of a mangy domain.. ...not to be found on any map. You don't deserve me. - Chamberlain. - Achoo! - 'Chamberlain!' - Y-yes, Your Highness, at once. At once, Your Highness. At once. The princess who finishes first and breaks the fewest the plates will marry the prince. - Hey! Hey! - Ah! Oh! Don't let it bother you. He's just a common prince. Not for you. 'There remain in the competition' 'Donna Olimpia Capce Latro Princess of Altamura' 'and Donna Isabella Candeloro, Princess of..' I have the pleasure to inform that the mother of your children will be.. ...Donna Olimpia Capce Latro, Princess of Altamura. Ah! Ah. Boy! 'Stop, Isabella! Stop!' Saint Anthony. To begin with I am not Saint Anthony. Whatever put that in your mind? I am only Joseph of Copertino. But I am your protector. And thank goodness I can still watch over you after death. Shall I tell you what you must do? You must go back to him. How can I do that? I haven't the courage to look him in the face after all he's done for me. Now, listen to me. Go back to him. Everyone knows how badly you've been cheated. He didn't cheat me. He couldn't have. No. Not him. He's a bit stubborn. But he's a fine boy. I know him. Now you go back and something will happen. Whoever knows the truth will find the courage to speak. Bless you, Saint Joseph. Oh, no, this is not the time to kiss me feet, Isabella. 'Bother Joseph.' Quick, now go away, please. Or the other saints will catch you. 'What other saints?' The ones you mustn't listen to. They'll start a long story and speak to you about resignation and how we must all suffer in this world because life is but a brief span in between. Brother Joseph. - Brother Joseph. - Brother Joseph. 'Brother Joseph.' Run along. Alright, I-I'm coming. Isabella, now go on. Run along, go. Thank you, Saint Joseph. Thank you. Go on, Isabella. Go back to him. '"In his magnanimous benevolus and with a generous wish' "that all should be happy on the day of his wedding "our most excellent Lord and master "Don Rodrigo Fernandez.. '"Concedes to all his most wretched' '"and miserable of subjects' '"the right to sit at his table' '"to eat and drink with him' 'to the very point of satiety."' Here. There's enough for all. 'I wanna drink some of that wine.' Isabella, come down here. I want to show you something. Over here. Look, Isabella, I kept all the pieces. Quiet! Quiet, all of you! I want to make a toast. Thank you, prince.. ...for honoring us as your guests here at your great table. Guards, arrest that slut. Let her speak! Don't be afraid. Nothing has happened. You've done nothing to be afraid of. Thank you, prince. Thank you for letting all your servants and subjects and me... for letting us all come here and with God's gifts eat enough for once.. ...instead of making do with one little dumpling. 'But I must thank you more than the others.' Because you trusted me. And relied on me. And you must think now I didn't deserve that. Plates can be broken in many ways. Like this. Or like this. This plate and the other four were cut with a diamond ring. A ring like that. I advised the princess. I told the princess to use her ring. I didn't want a dishwasher to become queen. Now I am sorry, of course but my convictions will always be the same. With Your Highness' permission I will leave immediately. At once. One moment. The prison is that way. Donna Isabella Candeloro Princess. Long live our princess. Long live our prince and princess. Long live our princess. * And along with the magic wonders * * That happened when you are there * * And you think you are mine * * Now and forever * * It's more than a miracle * * Someone like you * * Loving me **
