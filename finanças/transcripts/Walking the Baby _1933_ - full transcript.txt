My boss told me today that if I didn't kiss him, he'd fire me. A girl hasn't got a chance at all. Oh don't be silly, you have two chances. Either you kiss him or you don't kiss him. I know, but what if I don't kiss him? Well, you still have two chances. Either you get fired or you don't get fired. Well, what if I get fired? Well, uh, well you still have two chances.

Either you go to heaven, or you, oh well you better kiss your boss. Well I never heard of anything so foolish in my whole life. Aww, well you're silly. What's the matter Harry? Well you don't look good. Well, I lost quite a bit of money at bridge. Bridge? Huh, never lose. That's because you haven't got a system. With me, everything has a system. Never lose money in bridge, a system. Never lose money in poker, a system. Any kind of a card game, a system. Even a horse has a system, you know Harry. Eat the right kind of food, never get sick, a system. Eh, flirt with women, never get my face slapped, a system. My whole live consists of, everything is a system. Yeah? Say that's alright. Tell me one of them will ya? Which one? Well, the one about flirting with the girls. Flirting with the girls. Yeah. Well, the first thing you do, you pick out a name that no girl in the world has, let's say, Mamie Dittenfest. A girl passes, you tip your hat, you say, I beg your pardon, is your name Mamie Dittenfest? And she says no. You say you look like Mamie, she says I'm not Mamie, and the first thing you know, the girl takes you out to eat. It's a cinch.

Well when I left that restaurant I found $10.00 missing out of my handbag. I'm not saying you took the money, but I wish you'd pay me back. Well look, just a minute, you have the details all wrong. The first place, it wasn't a restaurant it was a cafeteria. Second place the check wasn't $2.00 it was $1.00, and the third place, you didn't have $10.00 in your handbag, you only had five. I had ten! Then you owe me five. Ohhh well, so long. So, look, I tell you what if you wait a little while, I'll take you home in my car. You know when any goof ever asks me where I live I always tell him I live in the country. Oh where do you live? In the country. Well so long. So long. Where are you going now? Well I'm going over to my sister's home. That's funny, you know where I was going? No. My brother's home. Oh Now look, when you get to your sister's home, you phone my brother's home.

Come, let's get some peanuts. Oh I don't want any more. Double order please. Oh I couldn't have any more. Well go on, just have it and I'll save this for you later. Oh there goes that baby again.
