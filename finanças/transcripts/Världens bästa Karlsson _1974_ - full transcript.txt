He was flying! Flying! - Who was flying? A little old fat man with a propeller on his back flew outside my window. Silly little thing! What are we going to do about all your fantasies? - It's not a fantasy! He was real! He had a propeller on his back and he was flying! I talked to him. Mummy, I 've nothing to do. - Go out and play, then. - No, I want to stay in. In case Karlsson comes. Who's Karlsson? - The flying man. - So you call him Karlsson? - That's his name. - Never mind. Go and see what Bosse is up to. What do you want? - Can we play noughts and crosses? - No, I don't have time. I have to practice . - Can't you do something else? All you ever do is play! All the time, all the time ... Yes, maybe tomorrow, Lillebror. Hoy, hoy! You didn't think I'd come back, did you? - No, but it's really great you did. - Yes, it's not every day you get to meet Karlsson-on-the-roof. - Karlsson-on-the-roof? Who's that? - I'm Karlsson-on-the-roof, if you can get that into your thick skull. If you behave, you can fly up to the roof with me to see my house. - Do you have a house on the roof? - Yep! I certainly do. The world's best house. And inside it the world's best Karlsson! - You're so lucky you can fly. How does the engine work? - Right. First I do this: propeller in, propeller out. Idle, silencer on, silencer off. It's juddering a little. Probably needs oiling. - Can I try? - You don't try any---ohhh! Oh, my head! Horrible ill-bred little kid! - I didn't mean it. I've got concussion and I'll have to go to hospital and have an operation! - You can stay a little longer, can't you? - If I stay I want to have some fun! Hey look, a steam engine! Let's start it up right now. - No. Daddy won't let me. Daddy or Bosse have to be here. - Daddy or Bosse or Karlsson-on-the-roof. The world's best steam engineer. - No, Karlsson, no! - Yes, Karlsson, yes! Look out! Fire in the hole! It needs to warm up a bit then it will work better. Look art the state of the bookshelf! What's Mummy going to say? It's of no account. Tell your mother that. An old bookshelf ... Out of the way. shrimp. Aha ... You have to check the safety valves, otherwise an accident can easily happen. Now you'll see somethibg! - Isn't this dangerous? - Dangerous? It's fun! - No Karlsson. - "No Karlsson." What's all the fuss about? I want a little fun otherwise I'm going home. What a blast, eh? Do you understand now who the world's best steam engineer is? Ohhh ...! It's exploded! What a bang, eh? You've ruined my steam engine. - It's of no account. I have several thousand. - You have several thousand?! Yes, well at least several hundred. - Hundreds! - Oh I don't count them very carefully, but there are probably several dozen. - Then can I have one? - Of course, another day. I just have to check them over. Huh, it's of no account. Dad! Can there be things that don't exist? There are flying saucers aren't there? - Well, I for one don't believe in them. - There are photographs of them. though. - Yes, of course ... Krister! Gunilla! - Ach that's rubbish! - You can't make us believe that. He flew, I'm telling you! I told you his name is Karlsson and he lives on the roof. What about it? People can live where they want, can't they? - And he destroyed the steam engine? He said it was of no account. - Don't be silly. - Lillebror, you can't blame anyone named Karlsson-on-the-roof. - Who doesn't exist. - Yes he does! - And he can't fly. - Yes he can! - Where's this Karlsson now then? - He flew away. The engine was a bit rough, so he said. He said he was going to get it serviced. - Yes, he should do that Otherwise I'ld have given him a service he'd never forget. Do you understand that you scared me? You could have been badly hurt. Maybe he'll never come back. Karlsson! Karlsson! The world's best Karlsson Karlsson! Karlsson! Hey look! Here comes Karlsson Karlsson! Karlsson! There realy really isn't any other Karlsson I like as much as me. Karlsson! Karlsson! The world's best Karlsson Handsome, generous, well-upholstered Karlsson Wise and good, that wonderful old Karlsson! No surprise that everyone likes me! Look, what a snotty little dog. Karlsson! What a bunch of ugly dogs. You should see the walls in my house. I have beautiful paintings on them. - Do you have many paintings? - Yes, several thousand. I paint them myself in my spare time. Lots of little roosters and other birds. I'm the best rooster painter in the world. - Can I please come up and see your house? - Of course. Another day. I have to look into this. - Where are you going? - Cooking. That's something I can smell a hundred meters away. The silencer! Bettan, close the window, please. I'm really very fond of meatballs. Get your mother to bring a few kilos. - No, we'll introduce you after dinner. - Am I supposed to starve to death? Maybe I can get some for you. I'll try, anyway. - Mmm yeah.. Mum, can I have some meatballs? - We're about to eat. - Can I get them on a plate, please? I'll tell you why later. Stubborn child! All right. You can have a couple then. Here. Stingy little boy! Couldn't you have brought more? They're good, aren't they? You'd think they'd been made by the world's best meatball maker ... ... but they weren't. Lillebror, dinner's ready! Bettan, get off the phone right now. We've almost finished dinner here. Mummy, promise me something. And Daddy too? - Promise you what? - Promise first. - No, I don't dare to. You might want me to promise you a dog. - It would be nice if you promised that, but it's not what I'm asking. Do you promise to promise? - Yes, OK, we promise. Now you've promised not to say anything to Karlsson about the steam engine. - How could they say anything to Karlsson when they never see him! - He's in my room. Come on, you'll see! - What? Wow! Well, it'll be fun to finally meet Karlsson! Karlsson? He's maybe a bit shy around people. - He's probably playing hide and seek. He's gone. - Exactly! Just when we were about to meet him! I'm not too keen on you using my meatballs as decoration. - I didn't do that, it was Karlsson. As long as it's not too weak. - What are you doing?! - I messed up. - Yes, you could certainly say that. Do me a favour, Bettan and get me some kitchen paper. Now it's me who needs a Karlsson to blame. You're silly, you are. What are you doing? - Wasn't me, it was Karlsson-on-the-roof. You're all so stupid, drives me crazy just listening to you! - At least you're cute! By the way, would you like to earn 50 ?re? I suppose so. What do I have to do? - It's not something you should do. It's something you shouldn't do. Don't show yourself in the living room all evening. - Pelle's coming over, you see, Pelle, Bettan's new boyfriend. - Yes, he is. You get 50 ?re if you don't show yourself. - If I can't come in shouldn't Bosse, Mummy and Daddy stay out too? - I'm going to Kenta's to study. - Play your guitar you mean! We're thinking of going to the cinema tonight. But Bettan will be at home with you. - Bettan at home with me? She'ill be sitting in the living room fooling around with her new boyfriend. That was nice ... Listen, Bettan, what kind of ears does he have, eh? Do they stick out out like your last boyfriend's? - For goodness' sake, Mum! He stood and stared at Klasse and said: "Bettan really won't like those ears." - Did you really do that, Lillebror? - Yes. His ears stood out like windmill sails. Bettan, I promise not to show myself all evening. Completely free of charge. I would pay not to have to see those windmill sails again. - Hi Pelle! - Hello. Hey, come in. Handsome, friendly, well-upholstered Karlsson. Thoroughly wise and wonderful old Karlsson. - Hi hi, Lillebror. Where did you go? You ran when Mummy and Daddy were going to say hello. - Can I help that they want to say hello when I have to look after my house? I have to look after my property. Where's my tower? Who destroyed my beautiful tower? And where's my meatball? - I-I didn't think you were coming back. - Oh what nonsense! The world's best builder builds a tower, and what happens? Just tearing down and destroying and eating up other people's meatballs. - It's of no account, isn't it? - Yeah, that's what you think ... But I'm the one who built the tower with these poor little hands. I'm not staying if this is how it's going to be. But if I got a present ... that might make me happy. - Would you like this? - Yes! That would be perfect! - It's yours. - It does work, doesn't it? Oh, lovely!! Now I won't keep getting lost on the roof in autumn evenings. And it's good for when you want to play tricks. - Play tricks? What do you mean? - Don't you know what playing tricks means? Lucky for you to have met the world's best player of tricks! Is there anyone we can play tricks on? - Only Bettan and her boyfriend. - Great! They'll do. - But I promised! - What exactly did you promise? - Not to show myself in the living room. - Not show yourself ... - No, Karlsson ... - Yes, Karlsson! If you go in under a blanket, you don't show yourself. If I go in under a blanket, I don't show myself either. So bad luck on silly little Bettan. - Like this, or else they'll see us straight away. Everybody likes to see a camel. A camel in the living room! Especially one with a trunk and lit up inside. Hey, hey! Here comes the world's most beautiful camel. Turn it off now! Pelle, can't we sit down and talk for a while? I'm not very good at talking to girls. - You can talk about anything. - That's easy for you to say, I can never think of anything. You really don't need to talk much. Are you home alone? Well, Lillebror is here, but he's promised to stay in his room. You know, Bettan ... I like you. - Do you? - Do you like me? - Yes, she likes all guys, so why wouldn't she like you? You little bastard! Open this door! You're gonna get it! Open the door! - Why? I didn't show myself. - Just wait until I get hold of you! You just don't understand fun, do you? - I'll give you fun when I get hold of you! Do all your boys have to have sticky-out ears? Let me out! This one's the same, isn't he. Do you see now who's the world's best trick player? Lesson three - Learn Swahili. Count from one to five. Speech exercise: Can you get me a carrier for a trip out into the desert? Exercise two: Please serve me two boiled eggs ... Serve me a cold desert with two carriers, please. But hard-boiled, my good man, so you choke on them. - What does the pastor walk on in the church? - The carpet? - No. The floor? - No. - His feet? - Yes. Please Miss? - Yes? - You know what Lillebror says? Lillebror says that there is an old man living on his roof named Karlsson. - Shut up! - He can fly! So Lillebror says. Lillebror has a lively imagination. That's something it's good to have. - Oh bite me, he's just lying. You need to stop talking shit! - Get used to it! Mummy ... - Oh Lillebror, have you hurt yourself? - No, Krister threw a stone at my head. - Why didn't you come and tell me? - What's the good of that? You can't throw stones anyway. You need to have a good aim. -Why do you have to fight all the time? - Sometimes you have to. If you disagree, you can discuss it peacefully and move on. If I say to Krister: "I can beat you up, you brat," and he says: "no way!" then you can't just discuss it. No, I suppose you can't. What did you disagree about today, then? You and Krister? - He blabbed about Karlsson to the teacher and said he's just make-believe. - Well he is. - No he isn't! Karlsson said that it's Krister who's only make-believe! - Play more with Gunilla and Krister and forget about Karlsson. At least Karlsson doesn't throw stones. By the way, Karlsson promised I could come up to see his house. Mum! Has Pelle called? - Yes. He asked for you. Nothing ... Ohh! I've been waiting for ages! How did you get in? Through the door, of course. What's wrong with you? Hey! Mind my fish! When you have a fever , you have to drink all the time. If one or two fish slip down , it's of no account. - Have you got a fever? - Yes I certainly have. 30 to 40 degrees, at least. Feel. - I don't think you have a fever. Damn, you're horrible! Don't I have the right to be sick like everyone else? - Do you want to be sick? - Well, everybody wants that. I want to lie in my bed with a really high fever. Then when you ask how I feel, I say I'm the world's sickest person. I have to take some nasty medicine and then I get five ?re. Raid your money box. You have to take care of me and be very kind. You should be like a mother to me. Do you understand? Where am I going to get nasty medicine? You stir ... caramel ... chocolate ... ... raspbery jelly and ... - Do you think sweets help against fever? - Sweets! It's not a question of sweets! It's a question of Karlsson-on-the-roof's cure-all medicine! if you can get that into your thick skull. Then some pieces of licorice. A little more. And then some ... raspberries. Can I have three of those ... Okay, that's enough. Mmm you're so lovely! Bye, Berta. There you are. Now you can beat for a while. - You can come up and meet Karlsson, okay? Oh wait, not today. - Why not? - There's something we have to do. - I really want to meet him. I can call Pelle at the same time. - Yes, and pick up the carpet in the hall. No, Bettan! Wait! Where is he, then? Bring him out. Maybe he's invisible so only you can see him. How long do I have to sit here in the wardrobe and wait? The fever's rising several degrees per minute. You'll be able to fry eggs on me soon. I'm the world's sickest person. We have to hurry up so you can get me into bed. I'm just going to write a note for Mummy. - How do I get to the roof? I can't fly. - Relax, I'll get you there no problem. Just be careful not to get your fingers caught in the propeller. - What if you drop me? - It's of no account. Anyway, I won't. - I'm not of no account. - I won't drop you. You've got the toffees and they aren't of no account. What a cute little house. It's the world's cutest Karlsson who lives there. It's so nice here. Please come in, dear Karlsson. And you too, by the way. You've got so much stuff. - All kinds of stuff and gadgets here. - Where did you get all of it? - Bought a little now and then. Everything's in order. Stuff on the right, gadgets on the left. Is it okay to bounce when you're sick? - I'm trying to bounce off the fever. Though it's really the cure-all medicine that does the trick. - Where do you keep all your steam engines? - Blew up - every one of them. Look at this rooster picture. Painted by the world's best rooster painter. So beautiful it'll make you cry. It's called "Portrait of a Very Lonely Little Red Rooster" ... it's called. - You're crazy. I like you though. - Yes, who doesn't? - Do you like me? - "Do you like me?" You sound like Bettan and her boyfriend. - "Do you like me?" Well ... Okay, I like you. How could anyone explain that? That I like you: just a stupid little boy. - Right, I think it's done. - Oh, I'm the world's sickest! - Open your mouth. - I don't want any horrid medicine! - You told me to make it. - Stupid boy! Always nagging me. - You have to take your medicine now! - I don't want to. It's so nasty. - When I have to take a nasty medicine I just make up my mind to take it. When I have to take a nasty medicine I make up my mind not to take it! - How about if I give you five ?re? - Just keep it coming! Keep it coming! More! More! More! More! More! Karlsson! Karlsson! Oh! Here sits Karlsson Karlsson! Karlsson! The world's best Karlsson - Do you think the fever has gone down? - I've never had a fever. - You said you had one. - It was just imagination. - Did you imagine you had a fever? - No, but I made you imagine it. Who is the world's best trick player? - That's you, Karlsson. Right, now we're going to fly. How are you, little man? Is it fun to fly? - I think so. Karlsson, can't we go to Gr?na Lund? - We can do that. - Although I don't have any money, of course. - Money! That's of no account! Stop, Karlsson, stop! Look down there. Isn't that Bettan and her boyfriend? - Yes it is. Let's play a trick on them! No, but ... What ...? Where in the world did that come from? Damn, that's scary. A small gift. Now, Lillebror, you don't happen to have any sweets left, do you ? - I have three toffees left. - Three toffees. Three can't be divided. The youngest child knows that. - Won't you even treat me to a toffee? - Yes, but now there are only two left. Who do you think should be allowed to choose first? - You, but you have to take the smallest one. Then you can choose first. - Okay. - But you took the biggest one! - Which one would you have taken? - The smallest one of course. - Well you got the smallest one, so don't whine. Now Karlsson will sort out some money. Hurray! We won! I won! Guess who's the world's best shot? It's Karlsson-on-the-roof! What useless darts! They hardly touched the board! So many people here. Oh look! There's Lillebror. Come and see! That's crazy. - Lillebror! Lillebror, what are you doing here? I have to get Dad. We can't leave the kid alone at Gr?na Lund. - No ... tonight this is impossible. Do you have any idea where Lillebror is? - Probably in his room, I think. Actually, he's at Gr?na Lund. At Gr?na Lund! You and your stories! - Come on, let's go and look. How can two kids look so alike? Dressed the same too. Darling, you're soaked through! Where have you been? - I was talking to a dog in the rain. -Where are Bosse and Bettan? - Out in the rain as well, probably. They're not at home. Into the bathroom and get undressed. Take the chance of a bath right now. You haven't eaten anything. I'm going to make chocolate and buns. Mummy! Krister and Gunilla are coming soon. - That's good. Time to get out now, Lillebror. My little darling, I do love you. What in the world ...! Daddy hasn't eaten your buns, has he? - It must have been Karlsson. - Don't start with Karlsson again. - You all think he's made up. - Yes, isn't that strange? Okay, arms up!. There you go. Now you sit down and drink your chocolate. What are you doing in the cupboard? - Hatching eggs? No... Contemplating my sins? No... Lying down for a nap? Yes! We can play hide and seek. I'll hide in the cupboard, then you can find me. - That's not hard, is it! Anyone can do that. You're horrid! You could surely have looked somewhere else first. I'm not playing! Krister and Gunilla are here. Great! Let's play a trick on them. Shut the doors. So where have you got your old Karlsson? - You say he's made up. - Well he is. - He certainly isn't! Not at all! Karlsson says that the whole earth is full of stupid little kids! have you got a rooster in the wardrobe? Who ... ? is it ... ? - Yes it is. A bit of make-believe. A pure invention, you might say. Is it Karlsson-on-the-roof? - What do you think? Do you think it's little granny lying here taking a nap? You haven't got much to say now, have you! And what little childish invention might this be, then? - What is your name apart from August? - My name's not August. And a good thing too! They're called Gunilla and Krister. Gunilla? Krister? Well, not everyone can be called Karlsson, I suppose. - Lillebror, Daddy and I are going out now. - Say hello to Grandpa. - We will. Krister and Gunilla have to go at eight o'clock. She didn't say when I have to go home. Why can't I be sent home too? Same as everyone else? I'm not in! - I can take you home at eight.. - No. That's not the same. Phone's ringing. Aren't you going to answer? No point, it's probably Bettan's new boy. Damn, this isn't fair! Damn, why is everything so unfair! Well? - No-one answering. - So let's get going. Or we can play ... Cowboys and Indians! Can I scalp you? No, I suppose not. We could play ... Ghosts! Scare people to death! Yes, let's do that. It'll be fun. I'm good at ghosts. If I had five ?re for everyone I scared to death ... ... I could buy loads of toffees. Scissors! A pair of scissors!! - What are you going to do with those? - Relax, just relax. Where are all the scissors? Here, Karlsson. You're ruining the sheet, Karlsson. - That's of no account A ghost has to have eyes. Let's try the steel wire trick. It needs to be dark when you're haunting. The world's best ghost: savage, but beautiful! I'm almost scared. Now let's go out and have some fun. There's always somebody to scare. - That's burglars! - We have to call the police. - Relax. Not with the best ghost in the world in the house. Quick! Hide! Someone was shouting. - That was me! I wonder where they hide the crown jewels. There! There, maybe. Over there. Typical. The usual place. The key's in the lock. The food money! When they have no food money, they have no food. If they have no food, they don't need cutlery! I'll grab the silver cutlery! Ghulle, a rost! - What? Rulle, a ghost! Quick! This way! - Get out, Rulle! - Good morning sweetheart. - Mornin'. - Now Lillebror ... I would like to know who cut your sheets. And I don't want to hear that it was Karlsson-on-the-roof. - Yes, but ... - But nothing. - Couldn't you ask Gunilla instead? - Gunilla! What's going on exactly? - There were burglars. Karlsson dressed up as a ghost and scared them away. - I've had enough of your fantasies. - They aren't fantasies! - Yes, of course they are. - That's what you think. - Are you saying Gunilla tore the sheets? I might have a little talk with her later. - No, don't have a little talk, just ask her about Karlsson. - You're so stubborn, Lillebror, you really are! Look, what a cute little puppy! Maybe he doesn't even have an owner. Maybe he doesn't belong to anyone!. - 'Course he does. - Shut up! What do you know about it. It says Ahlberg on his collar. - Then that's who owns him. - Maybe Ahlberg's dead. - That's what you think. Maybe it's the puppy who's called Ahlberg. Ahlberg! Come on then! Ahlberg! There you are! He comes when you call Ahlberg. Come on then! Didn't Mum say you couldn't have a dog? What's this tyke doing here? He hasn't anywhere to live. - I bet he does. Ahlberg, it says. There's a phone number, too. - You're crazy! You're so nice, yes you are! I think it's called Ahlberg. What do you think? - Could be. I have a thousand mutts called Ahlberg up in my house Why's there a phone number though? - That's obvious. The dog has its own phone, of course. Tell it to call home and tell them he's run away. My Ahlbergers always do that when they've run away. Huh, you're talking a load of crap. Little Ahlberg, you can be my dog. - "Little Ahlberg" ... Go and call home. - Mummy? Oh darling, don't you understand? The dog belongs to them, can't you see that? I have to call them. Please God, don't let it be their dog. Yes, Svantesson, fourth floor. Sweetheart, a boy called Staffan Ahlberg is Bobby's owner. - Bobby? - Yes. That's his name. Can you understand how upset Staffan has been? So he's coming shortly to pick him up. Karlsson! Karlsson! What a cute little pup you have, isn't he lovely! But you have to take care of him so he doesn't run away again. Lillebror? Are you coming to say goodbye to Bobby? What's this? You've got the world's best Karlsson here. And you just lie there howling? Shame on you! Do you want to come up on the roof with me to cheer yourself up? No? Then stay there. I'm just going to leave a note for Mummy. May I? Look! Have you ever seen anything so nice? I've made a new painting! See? I don't know which is more beautiful: "Portrait of a Lonely Little Red Rooster", or this one: "Portrait of my Bunny-rabbits". - It's a fox. Where are the rabbits? - They're inside the fox, obviously. - And this, what is it, exactly? - You see that, right? - Ye-e-s ... - It's ... a ... gadget. - What kind of gadget? - Oh, don't be silly. A gadget made by the world's best gadget-maker. Me. It's so nice here! And different. I don't understand why more people don't live on the roof. I'm glad you're around. Karlsson? It's my birthday tomorrow. Do you want to come to my party? - Yes, as long as there's enough to eat. - Yes, there'll be cake, of course. That sounds good! One cake for each year of your life. Otherwise it's unfair. Right. I want to have some fun now. Come on, Lillebror. Karlsson, will you save me if I fall off? - Of course, otherwise I won't get any cake tomorrow. Don't sit there being silly. Now we can see what the burglars are up to. I usually run around on the roofs and play tricks on people. - What tricks do you play on the roof? - You'll see. Go on then! I never play the same trick twice. I invent different ones. Look at it gleaming! - What a haul! Open up in the name of the law! This is the police! Lock it! It's the rhost, Gulle! Let me in! Let me in! You have to give them a fright every now and then. Maybe the poor thing's got a tummy-ache. - Yep, we'll find out. Hello? Is anybody there? Poor lonely little poppet. Mummy and Daddy are out gallivanting, I see. Here comes Karlsson-on-the-roof, the world's best nursemaid. - Karlsson, you daren't go in! You're not allowed. - What? The world's best nursemaid leave a little kid lying there screaming? My pluttipluttiplutt works every time. I've used it a thousand times. Can I hold her? - Yes, even though you aren't a nursemaid. - What's the matter? I wonder what her name is. - Gull-Fia. Almost all kids are called that. - I think Gull-Fia is hungry. - "Gull-Fia is hungry" ... Well. Okay, sausage and potatoes. No kid should starve to death as long as I can find sausage and potatoes. - Little kids should have milk. - Don't you think the world's best nursemaid knows that? - I can't find any milk. - I know where there's some. Wait there!. Please don't cry. Yes, little darling, I'm coming. So, Gull-Fia is hungry. - Where did you get that? - In my usual dairy. - Did you steal it? - I borrowed it. - When are you going to give it back? - Never! Couldn't you guess that? A bottle of milk is of no account. - I'll go and warm it up. Leave it to Uncle Karlsson! Now let's play a little game. This is number one, this is number two ... ... and this is number three. - Don't, Karlsson ... - Yes! We have to get her parents used to not gadding about in the evenings. - But how? A kid who can pick up falu sausage can't be left alone. Think what she could get hold of next: Daddy's Sunday beer, maybe? They're coming! - Relax, relax. - Look at this, Fredrik! - Now they've found the sausage. Karlsson, there's a fire somewhere. - Oh? - It's around here. - What if it's here in the house. - What if they're coming to get me down? I left Mummy that note. Maybe they've come to take me down. - Why? Can't you stay up on the roof for as long as you want? - and her nerves ... Don't tell them the world's best fire-putter-outer lives here. Because then they'll be pestering me every time there's a fire. Bye! Was it Mummy who sent you? - Yes. Who did you think? You certainly know how to scare someone to death! - Promise you'll never do that again! Didn't you think we might be worried? - No, not that worried. Oh sweetheart, what if you'd fallen! Would that have made you sad? - Of course it would! We don't want to be without you. - Not even for a hundred million kronor? - No, not even for a hundred million. - Am I worth that much? - Yes. But how did you get on to the roof? - Did you climb through the attic skylight? - No, I flew up with Karlsson. - Oh for heaven's sake! That Karlsson is driving me crazy! There is no Karlsson-on-the-roof. - So how can he drive Mummy crazy? - I don't know. - But now you have to have something to eat and then get to bed. It's your birthday tomorrow. Then you'll be going to Grandma's. I hope Karlsson doesn't intend to follow you there. Daddy? Daddy! You said I was worth a hundred million kronor. Then couldn't I use a few hundred to buy myself a little dog? - Go on, little pal, go back to bed. Yes, may he live Yes, may he live Yes, may he live for a hundred years - Happy Birthday! - Congratulations! - Happy Birthday! - It is possible that there'll be more presents. You may receive a package from us after school. How time flies. Remember the rain in Stockholm when he arrived? - I was born in Stockholm and Bosse and Bettan were born in Malm?. - Yes, that's right. And Mummy, you were born in Gothenburg. What luck that we all met. Let's see what you got. Aww look! Oh, I want a dog so much! But I've decided not to worry about it on my birthday. And 'pee-on-he-floor' ... ... he'll never play!. - Good, eh? Lillebror, here's another present for you. - Thanks! - You have to read this first. - You read it. "Every moment, every day 'I want a dog!' is all you say." "Kindly sister, caring brother Love you more than any other." "This lovely pup we've brought from us. Go on, say it: that's so nice!" "This little dog, so soft and round is just the coolest, perfect hound." "He won't jump up and bark all day, "and 'pee-on-the-floor' he'll never play! What is it, Lillebror? - We were just kidding. - Lillebror, what's wrong? You know how much I want a dog. You didn't have to make fun of me! Bosse, what are we going to do? Dad! We're so glad you're here!. Listen, my little chap. I have a dear friend here who'd like to meet you. He's called Bimbo. - I don't know anyone called Bimbo! - Maybe not. But he very much wants to get to know you. Are you happy now? - What do you think? You're so lovely aren't you! - This was supposed to be for Bimbo to play with. - This is my best birthday ever. The world's best birthday! Krister and Gunilla will be so surprised. - They're coming soon. - Karlsson too. There, now it's done. You haven't set a place for Karlsson! - You're such a baby at times!! Really, Lillebror. Lillebror! Now that you've got Bimbo, don't you think we can forget Karlsson? - That's easier said than done. I've brought your guests. - Happy Birthday! You got a dog! What's his name? - Yes. He's called Bimbo. - All right, kids, you can play with Bimbo later. - Shouldn't we wait for Karlsson? - No, we won't bother about Karlsson. Anyway, I'm sure he's not coming. - He said he'd come. - We'll see about that. Help yourselves. Eat up and have a good time. What?! You've started already? Aren't you ashamed of yourselves?! How much have you eaten? - We haven't started yet. - Shouldn't you congratulate Lillebror? - Yes. Happy Birthday. But where do I sit? There isn't even a cup for me! It's not fair! I can get you a cup. Did you see? I got a dog. Bimbo is so cute, don't you think? - You make such a fuss over the tyke. He's got four legs and a tail like all the other, hasn't he? Heyyy ... You don't have a plate. So I can eat your piece too. - I'm going to get myself a plate and a cup. Of course! I can get Mummy and Daddy and the others to come and meet you! So they can see you really do exist. - Why yes! It's time they met me. It'll be good for them They've had to wait far too long. Stop! I've never seen such a greedy girl! If you're as hungry as all that you can have a bun. Don't touch the cake. Now you'll see! - What are we going to see? Where's Karlsson? - Yes, Lillebror, where is Karlsson? Karlsson doesn't exist, and will never exist. There's no such person as Karlsson-on-the-roof.. - Oh ... Really? A pleasure, such a pleasure, a real pleasure for you to meet Karlsson. Don't be so greedy, Gunilla. - No, no, I think I'm going to faint. - No, don't. - I'm fainting. - Come on, let's go. Back to the kitchen. Don't let me stop you. I was going to get myself some cake. - We have to talk about this. - That shut you up! - You can say that again! Are they always so completely crazy? Hand me the fork, Lillebror. The world's best cake eater - guess who that is. - You, Karlsson. - Correct. Promise me one thing now. All of you. Not a single word to anybody. - But why? We wouldn't have a moment's peace. Karlsson would be all over the TV. There would be photographers and journalists. And Lillebror! He'd be the boy who found Karlsson-on-the-roof. - We can't let that happen. - No. We all agree on that? All of us? Bimbo, we're going to Grandma's tomorrow. "Little Bimbo, tomorrow you're going to grandma's ..." How about if you thought about little Karlsson too? - I do, of course I do. I think of you all the time. Are you sure you'll still be on the roof when I get home from Grandma? My grandmother may not let me go. She thinks I'm the world's best grandchild. - Are you? - Of course, who else? - My grandmother might think I am. - Really? Is your grandmother crazy? - Bimbo, you're the world's best dog. - Because that can't be you, eh, Karlsson? - If I were a dog, I think I'd be the world's best dog. - I think so too. - Exactly. Right ... Hey-ho, Lillebror. I'm off now. - Hey-ho, Karlsson! Karlsson, you really will come back, won't you? Karlsson! Karlsson! The world's best Karlsson! Karlsson! Karlsson! Hey! here comes Karlsson! Karlsson! Karlsson! There realy really isn't any other Karlsson I like as much as me. Karlsson! Karlsson! The world's best Karlsson! Handsome, kind and well-upholstered Karlsson. Thoroughly wise wonderful old Karlsson It's no wonder that everyone likes me Of course at times there'll be someone to lose his rag with me And shout and curse and make a fuss When I've done something wrong But there's no point in argument It's just of no account! And guess who this is coming here With an engine on his back It's Karlsson, hurrah hurrah! It's Karlsson, hurrah hurrah! It's Karlsson! Hurrah hurrah for me! Karlsson! Karlsson! Hey, here comes Karlsson! Look out! Make way! Here is good old Karlsson Yes, he's coming! The world's best Karlsson Everybody loudly say hooray for me
