The fuck? Somebody help me! Let me outta here! Olivia? Hello, Olivia. Who the fuck is that? While I do understand that it may be frustrating to see your brother, don't let that distract you from the fact that you spent nearly your entire life with nowhere to run. Oh, my god. Only you know what you need to do next, Olivia. What the hell is she talking about, Olivia? You know exactly what she's talking about. Where are you going? What are you doing? You need to let me out of here. Please. Let me out of here! I'd like to use my hint. If this is about what I think this is about, then you need to let it go. Okay, this is not okay. All right. Why are you ignoring me? You need, let me the fuck out of here! Look, I'm not dying because somebody can't keep their mouth shut. No, no. No, no, I'm sorry, I didn't mean that. I look, look, no, no, no. I'm sorry. You've been a great sister. Look, I love you. Look, I'm begging you. I'm begging you, please don't do this. I begged you for years and you never fucking listened. No, no, no, no, no, no! Don't do this! Because of you, I fear boys! You're supposed to be my brother, Garrett. Brothers are supposed to help their little sisters. Wait. You're not the victim. You're right about that, Garrett. I'm not a victim. I'm a goddamn survivor. Oh, hey, you got a light? I'm sorry, I don't smoke. Oh. Fuck. Oh shit. Hey, you got a light? No, I don't smoke, sorry. Oh. Hey, it's you. Hey. What are you doing out here? The meeting started like 40 minutes ago. Does Brad need me? I can come in and help. Shit, I shouldn't have stayed out here so long. Never mind. All right, I'll see you in there? Cool. Brad, I'm sick of it. I'm sick of everyone telling me, no things are gonna get better. They don't understand what it's like to have everything you've ever dreamt of having taken from you in an instant. And I had the life I always wanted, you know. I had the expensive car, the dream girl, a roof over my head. And now it's all gone. Because I let this stupid disease get the best of me. I got nothing left to be grateful for. You have a pulse, right? Because being alive is worth being grateful for. I just want my life back. Hey, can you believe this guy? Look, I for one am so proud of you and how far you have come with your addiction. And hey, it's not only me who is proud. It's all of us. Everybody, please come on, let's give a round of applause for Travis. Oh, come on. Are you serious? I'm sorry, is there a problem? Yeah, we get it, we're all addicts with sob stories. Boohoo. Victims of the system, right? No, we are survivors. Survivors, right? Sorry. My bad. If I'm not mistaken, all you motivational speakers are frauds and you just like to stand up and waste everybody's time because you wanna feel good about yourself. Well, it's very clear that you have a lot on your mind. So would you like to tell everybody why you're here in the first place? Why not? Hi, everybody, I'm Jake. Good to be here. - Hi. - Hi, Jake. Hi, yeah, well, whatever that was. Anyways, I'm a nobody with no purpose and no heart, just a fool that was left to rot in a cage for about a year and a half. So anyways, deuces. Allow me to explain something to you, Jake. You see, we as human beings are forced to live inside of our own minds, also known as an emotional prison created by others, leaving us with no other choice but to try our very best just to fit in all for a chance to feel what? Accepted. Remember this, remember that with each and every day, danger is real and fear is a choice. I'm sorry, you were saying that you're a nobody. Is that right? Yeah, that's right. Let me ask you something. Are you sure you're a nobody, or do you just feel like one? Go ahead, tell me what you believe to be the truth. The truth? The truth is I'm a former drug addict with nothing left to give. Sorry, mom. I'm sorry, what is so funny about that? Huh? What is so funny about a man who refuses to accept his potential? I say it every single week, once we decide to make peace with our addictions, it is then that we have the power to make our reflections change. And whether you realize that or not, Jake, we all, including you, have something to give. Which brings me to a question that each of us in this room may share the same answer for. Here we go. How many of you have ever found yourself in a dangerous situation? Show of hands please. Look at that. Look at that. We are all survivors of addiction. And so am I. As my struggle with codependency has taught me such a very valuable lesson in life, and what that is is the fact that power does not mean perfection. People look at us as addicts all the time, but never as survivors. Okay, this feels like a good place to stop for today. So with that being said, I want to thank you for being here and thank you for being survivors, instead of statistics. Have a great holiday weekend. I will see you next week. Thank you guys so much. Hey. I might have been a little bit awkward at the car earlier, so why don't we just hit the restart button, start fresh. May I offer you a bagel? I made these myself this morning, came in really early. Had to. Excuse me, may I speak to you two real quick? Excuse me, no. Of course, Brad, what is it? Well, there's something I would like for the both of you to be a part of. No thanks, we're good. Come on, Jake, could be fun. What is it, Brad? With the holidays right around the corner, there is no better time for me to give back, and to cut to the chase, let's just say I was contacted about an experiment and it just so happens to offer substantial compensation. Wow. Substantial, you say. How substantial? Very substantial. It would require three people willing to participate in an escape room based around their addictions, and you two seem like the perfect fit. So what do you two say? Are we getting paid? Do we get gold bullion? I accept cryptocurrency in Bit coin, Ethereum, pirate booty. You get more than a paycheck, Jake. You walk away with a new outlook on life that no rehab could ever provide. Wow, he's not paying us. Okay, well, either way, I'm in. Okay, fine, I'll do your thing. Wonderful. So did you have anybody else in mind? As a matter of fact, I do. Meet me tomorrow at noon, Serayah's Palace downtown. All right, we'll be there. Sierra, can you lock up for me? I'm gonna give Matt a ride home. Yeah, I'll get the keys. Oh., Jake, before you go. I just wanted to apologize for how I acted earlier. I shouldn't have made such a big scene in front of everybody. So again, sorry. Good. You're reluctant to accept my apology, right? I get it. Okay, I do, I get it. You're only here because legally you have to be and it makes perfect sense, it really does. What I am so passionate about Jake is you. Yeah, you. I am so passionate about you because I know that you can be a hero to these people. I know that your story can be someone else's inspiration. Whoa, whoa, whoa. You don't know about my story, okay? Nah, you'd be surprised by what I know. But here. Cigarettes. What, you're a smoker, right? Yeah, but I don't understand why you're giving this to me. You never know when you'll need a light. Of course, no matches, no lighter, could use a light now, dick. You got everything? Oh yeah, sure. Oh, hey, question. What is it? Your butterfly hair clip, you just like butterflies, or does it have like a special meaning or? Yeah, it means everything. I'll see you tomorrow, Jake. I'll see you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. Oh, you're good getting to your car? I'll survive. Portland's beautiful, huh? Yeah, it is. Hey, I was meaning to ask you something. Sure. I've always wanted to host my own AMA. Ask me anything. Don't worry about it, it's stupid. What's up? I just noticed there was some tension between you and Brad. What's up with that? Oh, nothing much. He's just an asshole that thinks he's better than everybody. You know. Or maybe he's trying to help you. Maybe. Maybe I can help him? You see, I know a great surgeon that can remove that stick from up his asshole. And with that, I'm gonna head inside. You coming in? Nah. I'll be out here for just a moment longer. Just clear my head. All right, see you in there. See ya. Of course. Dick only gave me four cigarettes. The fuck is that? Hello? Hey, anyone here? Sierra? Hi, I'm Roger. Oh, what the hell? You must be Jacob. Can you see me right now? I can see everything, Jacob. That's not weird or anything. Listen, kid, I get it, you don't wanna be here. You could care less about these escape rooms. Seen a lotta shit, I bet, huh? I heard you did a lot of time. Yeah, I did like a year and eight months up north over. Well, listen, I just got out of a 25 to life sentence in a high supermax prison! So if you wanna come at me with your tough guy charade, then bring it! Because I'll dig a grave so fricking fast and bury your ass in it! You won't know what fucking hit you. And remember leave all personal items, such as bags, recording devices, cell phones, lighters in the tray in front of you. And remember not everybody gets a choice, but you do. Good luck, Jake. Well, that just happened. Oh good, it's you. Always wonderful to see you too, Jake. So I'm here for your stupid haunted house or whatever this is. Well, what I think you meant to say was escape room, and the meeting room you will be meeting in will be down the hall to your left down there. So what do you want from me, ID, anything? Well, besides any bags, phones, keys, recording equipment and or lighters, the only thing I need from you, Jake, is to sign this waiver right here. And you do understand that with any type of experiment comes potential risks associated with the activities that will take place here today. Do you understand this? Wait, this is a controlled experiment, right? Of course. Oh, hey. Hey. Here's that waiver for you, Brad. Thank you. I'll see you in the meeting room. Adios. Alrighty. You said the meeting room was down this hall and to the left. That's exactly what I said. And one more thing, Jake, not everyone gets a choice, but you do. Hey, this is where we meet? In here, where we are currently meeting? No. Ignore him. Yeah, this is the place. So did anyone else get greeted by the Great Value Captain Spalding? No? Just me. All right. Wow. Sorry, I'm not trying to be nosy, but your sketch is incredible. Thanks. So I had no idea you were an artist. I've always wanted to be an artist. Really? Yeah. That ended the day I turned 21. Alcohol? No. Gambling. All right. Who's ready to walk out of here today with a new outlook on life? Let's do it. Oh, we will. But before we get started, let's cover the rules of today's experiment. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Escape the escape room, don't break shit, rules done. If only the rules were that simple. So today you will find yourselves in various escape rooms based around your addictions. It will be your job to figure out which room is yours. When the door to the first room locks, you will then have 60 minutes to complete today's experiment. If you get stumped, just yell out loud, and our Game Master Michael will be there to assist you with a hint. But use your hint wisely, as only one hint is allowed per room. Any questions? Wonderful. Follow me to room one. Welcome to the room of reflection. Nope, this is the castle room. No, as you see, this is the room where each of you will reflect on yourself the most in ways you have never done before. Sorry, that doesn't make any sense. I assure you it does. Go ahead, take a look for yourself. Wow. The attention to detail here is impressive. Thanks, I really appreciate that. I bet you're proud of what you created here. Yeah. So proud. What about you, Sierra, what do you think of my creation? Yeah, it feels special. It is. I see you admiring our shield of courage over there. Shield of courage, huh? I kind of like that. Why, does courage mean something to you? Actually, yeah. Yeah, it means everything to me. Always has. Good to know. Well, this is where I leave you. Best of luck. And one more thing. I hope it was worth it. What did he mean by "I hope it was worth it."? Sierra, it's okay, he's just trying to spook us. Yeah. I mean, it's all just part of his whole, the danger is real thing, you know. He's just trying to toy with your emotions. Don't let him get inside your head. What was that? Probably Matt's stomach. Need anything, man? You need to eat some food, take a shit? What, no. I'd like to thank you all for being here, as today marks the first day of the rest of your lives. In less than 60 minutes, a winner will be determined and the rest shall be history. Focusing on the room you find yourselves in currently, it may be confusing as to whose room this is, but know that it does hold deep meaning for one of you. Search the room for clues, proceed as instructed. Remember this. Don't be afraid to fail, but more so, be afraid to give up. There's something off about this room. Oh, it's gonna be all right. You're gonna be okay. No, seriously, I need to get outta here! Hey, what's wrong? We just got here. Yeah, is there an underlying health issue or something? I mean, there's nothing that's happened to warrant this kind of behavior. I get panic attacks, okay. And this is my first escape room, I guess I'm just a little freaked out. Well, don't worry. Escape rooms aren't meant to be scary, they're meant to make you just use your brain. I am using my brain, and my brain knows that I have terrible anxiety and I need to get outta here. Well, tell your brain that the worst thing that's happened so far is that we saw Brad's stupid face, huh? Huh? Seriously. I'm not gonna let anything happen to you. I promise. Okay. There you go. Hey guys, look. Why are we being filmed? Just in case something goes wrong, which it won't. Plus these cameras are here just to help us with our hints. Holy shit! You know what I think? I think this is one of those reality shows where they put the people inside the building and then compete against each other for cash prize or something. But this has nothing to do with money. And money isn't everything, trust me. No, but it sure as hell can buy you a really great time on a Saturday night in Tulsa. What is wrong with you? Depends on who's asking. What is that? That? That is a clock, genius. "Time heels all wounds." What? Oh, the clock and the bandages it's meant to represent wounds healing over time. Can I see it? This clock doesn't tick. Hey, what's that? What does that say? "And then time stood still." Well that would explain the clock not ticking. But what does this have to do with any of our addictions? Oh, that's what we have to figure out. "Time to reflect." What? "Time to reflect." What about that chest over there? What about it? Might as well check it out while we're here. Okay. Well, let me think for a second here. It's no coincidence that there's two mirrors in here and one of them says "Time to reflect.", and obviously mirrors cause reflections. Yeah. So Brad said earlier that this room was where we would reflect on ourselves the most. Right. So maybe we stand in front of this mirror and we reflect. Right? Oh, what's that? "There are 3 sides to every story." Any idea what that means? Well, there are three of us in this room? And the three of us are addicts, and Lord knows every addict has a story to tell, right? I got it. It's like Brad always says, once we come to peace with our addictions, we have the power to make our reflections change. And? That still doesn't tell us who this room is for. No. But maybe telling our stories will. Yeah, and if every room has something to do with our addictions, then maybe our stories should too. Guess I'll start. So I guess my addiction isn't just to self-harm, it's an addiction to feeling, that's the light way of putting it. Feeling what? Anything. My foster parents liked the drink a lot. In elementary school I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression. Being abused by my foster parents, my brother and I grew up with this overwhelming sense of anxiety and fear. I never felt good enough. My brain constantly told myself I deserved the pain that I was going through. And to this day, anytime things begin to overwhelm me, the urge to cut comes back again. So yeah, there it is. Yes, my addiction is feeling like I need to be the one in control. Nobody likes to lose, especially when it keeps happening over and over again. I've lost everything you can imagine, from a six-figure paying job to my friends and my family, and especially the love of my life. This disease takes your mind away. It makes you feel invincible until that feeling wears off, which is almost instantly. A long time ago I used to tell myself that the addiction to the thrill of winning is not as bad as being dead, but the more time that passes, the more I second guess that thought. All the people I've lied to, all the people I've stolen from, if you ask me if I would do it again, I would be lying if I say I wouldn't. You gambled with fire. Damn right I did. I'm sorry, Matt. Me too. It's your turn, Jake. What's your story? Just so you know, I don't have a addiction or anything. It's okay. We're all in this together, and it's kind of the only way out. Well, I guess what I mean to say is I'm not currently addicted to something, but I guess it's, as they say, once an addict, always an addict. I got caught up living a lifestyle I really had no part of. You say you lost your family? Yeah. Yeah. You're not alone. I lost everything because of my refusal to believe that I had a problem. And not just that, but that I was the problem. Jake, it's okay. We're here for you. You know, one thing led to another and it wasn't just the pills I was taking, but, God, it led to the worst of the worst, heroin. Jake, your addiction doesn't define you. That's so easy to say, but you're not the reason that a human being isn't here anymore. I killed someone. What are you talking about? I have to wake up every day with that black cloud hanging over my head, knowing that I am the reason another human being isn't in this world anymore. They found him in his car in the parking lot of some doctor's office. Wait a minute. What? I worked at a doctor's office. One of my coworkers was found overdosed in the parking lot. It's probably not the same guy. What was his name? Ryan Fuller. He was my coworker. He was telling me right before he died how upset he was over some girl turning him down. And I was the girl. Wait! What? What, how was I supposed to know turning him down would lead to him killing himself? Oh, okay. So this Ryan connection can't be a coincidence, can it? "There are three sides to every story." While it's great we're all learning new things about each other, it still doesn't explain whose room this is for, and that's the most important thing right now. He's right. We need to stay focused on why we're here. So let's figure out whose room this is by narrowing it down to what we know already. Well, none of us are from the Middle Ages, so I guess that rules that out. History, medieval. History? Yeah, history, that's the theme of the room. Yeah, so I guess that explains the Ryan connection, right? It still doesn't explain whose room this is for. Question. What? Have any of us tried opening this door? You really think it's gonna be that easy to open this door? Got it. Looks like it. It smells like gasoline in here. Yeah, it does. Don't tell me, we just locked ourselves in here. Try the latch. I think it's automatic, it won't open. Shit, are you okay? You look like you're about to have a panic attack. My chest hurts really bad. There's a camera. We'll just tell 'em what happened. Yeah, we'll just tell them we need to go into the other room. We're locked in here. Yeah, can you guys just let us into the other room real quick please? No, no, no, no, no. Why aren't they letting us out? It's okay. Look, I think I found our way out already. There's a door over there. It's locked, there's not a keyhole. Of course. Why don't we use our hint? They said we get one per room, right? Good idea. All right, we're ready for our hint now. Nobody gets left behind. What kind of hint was that? Stupid. Hey, there's a key. Matt, are you okay? I'm fine. I just. Hey, are you all right? No, I feel another panic attack coming on. We're gonna get outta here sooner than later. Sierra, just breathe than me, okay? Like that? Yeah, exactly like that. Jackpot. "The perfect match." This thing is tiny. I don't trust myself with tiny things. You should probably hold onto this. "Sometimes you have to risk life "in order to live, "and gamble death, to sacrifice life. "Today is the day you can win "the biggest gamble of your life, survival." What's he doing over there? I don't know, but maybe he slipped and fell again. Fine, I'll go check on him. Hey, man, what are you doing over here? Oh my God! What the fuck are you doing? I'm making the right choice. What the fuck does that mean? "Perfect match." "Perfect match." Matt, are you okay? Smells like gasoline in here. Yeah, it does. Okay, listen, listen, listen, listen, okay? I don't know what you think you might be doing, but whatever choice this might be for you. It's not the right one. Fuck you! Yeah, sure, fuck me, I get it. The stakes are high, but we need to work together. I'm done with working together. This whole thing is supposed to be about our addictions. Yeah, it is, it is, it is. It is about our addictions and our addictions have only brought us closer together, okay. It's like the guy said when we first got here, we need to make today about the first day of the rest of our lives, right. We need to act like that, okay. Now, Matt, please, please hear me out, please. Please hear me out, okay. You are a good person. What would you know about being a good person, you killed Ryan! - Ryan killed himself, man. You're just as guilty of murder, you deserve to rot! Okay, sure, but whatever choice you think that this is, what do you think that that's gonna make you, hmm? A winner. Matt. I'm so sorry. Somebody send help! Someone's down here. Do something! I don't think these rooms were made to help us. I think they were designed to kill us. Oh my God. If we're gonna get outta here alive, we're gonna have to work together. That means I'm gonna need to be able to trust you. Deal? Deal. Okay, good. Did Matt really have to die? We were supposed to work together. That's what nobody gets left behind meant. Yeah. My God. Guess this really was Matt's room. Where are we? Home. Hello again, Jacob and Sierra. I would like to apologize for the demise of your fellow competitor, but in order for this game to be taken seriously, an example needed to be set of what can happen. This is my room, I don't know what to do. Just breathe. You're not gonna get away with this! Oh, Sierra, please settle down. You said it best in the previous room, he gambled with fire, and for that he burned. I don't wanna be a part of this anymore. And you think I do? It's easy for you to say, this isn't your room. Please pay attention, Sierra, as this room was designed for you. For nearly your entire life, you have gone through horrendous events that continue to haunt you. And for that, I offer my sincerest condolences. However, spending the majority of your life holding onto nothing but anger and resentment will leave you in a state of never ending madness. Are you ready? Not really. It'll be okay. Hey, hey, hey, hey, calm down. It's just a mannequin. That's not it. What's this? "It's hard to keep a secret "when it's written all over your body." What's in the folder? What are you hiding from me? I can't tell you. You can't tell me, really? You just said it yourself in the previous room, we have to be able to trust each other. It is the 4th of May, 2002, and police in the state of Oregon have officially confirmed the deaths of Jonathan Wagner and Elizabeth Bronson as a result of smoke inhalation. As reported in previous weeks, the married couples' residence mysteriously caught fire during the late hours of April 22nd, 2002. Their foster children, whose names are being withheld due to their age, were found alive at a neighbor's residence nearby. Police say they had no reason to suspect foul play. Investigators believe faulty wiring could have played a part in this ongoing situation. Jake, I'm sorry I didn't tell you. No wonder you were so quick to kill Matt. If I didn't kill him he would've killed you. You are a murderer. Don't use that word! I'm a survivor! Oh, this is no time for addict's anonymous catch phrases. This is real life. Where did you get that? We got it in the folder. - Give it to me. - No! Give me one good reason why I should even consider the idea of trusting you. Because you don't understand. You don't know the nightmares I had to go through every day. What are you talking about? Okay. When I was born, my brother and I were given up for adoption, we never met our real parents. You would think our adopted parents would be our real parents after living with them for so long. But they weren't parents at all. They took advantage of me, Jake. I was just a kid. What kind of parents do that to their own children? And how was I supposed to know that what was happening was even wrong? The truth is, when me and my brother turned 10, we made a choice, a choice that for the first time in our lives, instead of being victims, we were survivors. I'm sorry, I didn't know. Can you please just give me the key? I want both of us to get out of here alive. Yeah. I trust you. This was my childhood bed. This was the only good part about my childhood. This bed where I'd fall asleep, and when I was asleep, I was free. Being asleep was the only time I could escape the nightmares I was living every day. Okay, I understand this room has a lot of sentimental value to you, but we are running outta time and we still don't know our way out of it. They got everything about this room right. That's nice. Cool, great reminiscing and everything. Once we decide to make peace with our addictions, it is then that we have the power to make our reflections change. Your a butterfly hair clip, so you just like butterflies or does it have a special meaning? Yeah, it means everything. Hmm. Did you know that butterflies don't have pain receptors in their brains? Meaning they can't feel pain. No, I didn't know that. Butterflies can go through a lot of pain and still survive. I guess I kind of like to think of myself as a butterfly sometimes. They just mean. Everything to you. We should just focus on getting out of here. Yeah. Yeah, good idea. Hey, think I see our way out. Alrighty. Needs a key. Okay, so there has to be a key somewhere in this room. We don't have any time for this. All right, I'll use my hint. Good idea. I'd like to use my hint now. Oh, I got it. Where did you get that? Oh, Matt left it on the table and I just grabbed it when we left the room. Smart. Yeah, right. Do the honors. Here we go. Oh, yeah. Yeah, this is my room all right. This is an exact replica of the cell I was in. Same size, interior, everything. Honestly, I feel like I should be there right now till rotting. Congratulations on making it to the final room. Jacob, the room you find yourself in is one that should be all too familiar to you. After all a jail cell is a place you once called home. We're in this together, remember? Yeah. You took away a human life. Jake. Each human has a story, has dreams, a potential to achieve a greatness. Murder goes against this. Try and help you out. Thanks. You stole not only a life, but a future, a story in the making and all you got was a manslaughter charge, and you were released in less than two years. Despicable. You never learned anything, Jake. But today I promise that you will. Oh, shit! Hey, come take a look at this. "Courage is the ultimate protection." Well, courage means everything to me. Where'd you find that? It was on the back of the safe. I found this too. Closure? Well, there's stuff over there, but we can't get to it. Hey, there's the door. I bet that needs a key as well. Yeah, and I'm willing to bet you the key to our freedom is in this stupid safe. Okay. Then we just need a four digit code. Right. If we can get outta here. I'm a goddamn survivor! Fuck you! Hey, calm down. How am I supposed to remain calm? The people that are doing this to us know everything about us, stuff that nobody should know at all, okay! They know your history, my history, Matt's history! For Christ's sake they built an entire jail cell based on the one that I spent a year and a half in. They designed a room based on the house that you burned down, okay. Today was supposed to be a fun day where we could all just get together and Kumbaya and better ourselves as addicts. But guess what? Now Matt is dead because you. Because he let his addiction get the better of him. What are you doing? Hold on. This is new, this was not in my cell. "You never know when you will need a light." A lighter, is this some sort of joke? Now there's something I hadn't thought of until now. What? What happens when the timer reaches zero? Who are you guys? What the hell? Haven't we gone through enough today? What are you talking about? I think she's just another subject. There were others. I just wanna go home. Well, if that's the case then why are you so covered in blood, and there's blood on that knife? It's not mine, I swear. That's not what I mean. Then what did you mean? I was forced to make a choice that entailed either being locked in a room to die or to take justice in my own hands and take the life of my abuser. Olivia, it's okay. I'm a survivor too. Does it get better? Now it does. Wait, how do you know my name? Ladies, it's really great that we're all friends here, but we need to work together and find a way out of this place. Are there any clues in that room? Look over there. Maybe over there. Hey, that has my name on it. What does it say? Well, anything? Olivia? That didn't do anything. Try the next one. I'm sorry. What? What are you talking about? Olivia. Olivia. - Wait! Come back! Aw, shit! No, no, no, no. Use your hint or something. Yeah, I'd like to use my hint now. If you can take a life, you can save a life. I don't know what that means! We need the code! We need the code code. The code, the code. Dick only gave me four cigarettes. Then we just need a four digit code. Jake? Seven. Four. Six. There was a. Shit! You said probably four? Yeah. Is it working? - Goddamn it! No, nothing is working! Goddam it, fuck! Hey. Thank you for keeping your promise. What promise? That you wouldn't let anything happen to me. Yeah, of course. I pinky sore. Jake, I need you to promise me something else. Yeah, what's up? Promise that you won't take what's about to happen personally. Sierra, what are you doing? This guy tried to fucking kill us. I told you before all he ever wanted to do was help you. Hey, please allow for me to explain. No, okay, nothing you say will ever bring Matt back to life, okay? Okay, Matt, didn't die because of me, Matt died because of Matt. You can try and justify murder all you want, but at the end of the day, that's all you are, a murderer. That's only fair. But I like to refer to myself as a survivor, a survivor of pain, a survivor of truth, a survivor who has lived to tell the story and published the book. Jake. Tell me, what do you see in this guy? This guy is my brother. Being abused by my foster parents, my brother and I grew up with this overwhelming sense of anxiety and fear. Danger is real. And fear is a choice. When me and my brother turned 10, we made a choice. Not everyone gets a choice. Choice. That for the first time in our lives, instead of being victims, we were. We are survivors. Survivors. Your brother, he's your fucking brother? Yeah, sure, kill me, I don't give a fuck! Give me this one little consolation. What is in this? What is in this? You want the code? Yeah, I want the code to the safe, please. Sure, my pleasure. Code is six, seven, four, two. Go ahead, open it. Is this some sort of fucking joke? Not a joke. It's what you've been searching for for the last two years. Go ahead, press play. Hey, Brad. It's Ryan. Oh, thank God. First off, I just wanna say that I'm sorry that I haven't been showing up to the Addictions Anonymous lately. I'm just not in a good place right now, or at all, really. Last week, my dad, he lost his battle with cancer. And this week I just feel like I'm losing my own. I'd like to think that people care. I know that they don't. The one person who I felt truly cared about me was my best friend, Jake. But I soon found out what I meant to him. He sold me pills knowing damn well I'm suicidal. I've made a lot of mistakes in my life, but the worst is to come after you see this video. It's like I told you in the meetings before, we need to find a way for the others to have a new outlook on their lives. If you're willing to help me, I believe there's a way. Call it an experiment, if you must. Before he died, my dad, he finished constructing an escape room that never opened. And I'm giving you permission to use this location as a way to help the others. Right, you start off small, then you help the survivors get the justice they deserve, no matter how you do it. You just make sure that they survive. Okay? Look, I've sent you details in the text before this video, and I hope you seriously consider this, Brad. Not everyone has a choice. But you do. Look, I'm sorry that I couldn't be a survivor. I'm sorry. I want you to be assured it'll all be over soon enough. Fuck! Stop! What is wrong with you? You've completely lost focus of why we agreed to do this. We agreed with Ryan, or so I thought, that we had an opportunity to make people change and have an opportunity to see the difference of their mistakes, and we're not a statistic, we're survivors and danger is real, fears is a choice. Oh, my God, Sierra, do you really believe that bullshit? I believed it because it was true. The abuse, the trauma, the nightmares we went through every day, that was real for me. I thought we killed our parents to get away from the abuse that we were suffering, not for fun or for money, but because we had no other choice. Now we do have a choice. It seems like you've completely forgotten what being a survivor is supposed to represent. You're right. You're exactly right, Sierra. Which is exactly why you need to kill him. What? I'm so sorry. Your brother's a piece of shit manipulator. You don't have to do this. Stay the fuck out of this, all right. You don't deserve this. You don't have to do everything he says. He's all I have, Jake. Sierra, hurry the fuck up! Stop yelling at me! You can be your own person. Look, you've got five seconds to kill this asshole right now. If you don't do it, I will do it myself. If you're gonna kill me, then just do it, but remember, not everybody gets a choice. But I do. It's like I told you in the meetings before, we need to find a way for the others to have a new outlook on their lives. You walk away with a new outlook on life that no rehab could ever provide. I was forced to make a choice that entailed either being locked in a room to die or to take justice in my own hands, and take the life of my abuser. I'm a goddamn survivor! I'm done, Brad. The only reason I agreed to these experiments was so I could help people. You did this to hurt people. I'm tired of being a little sister that gets manipulated by her brother. You were never a survivor, Brad. I was. Michael, send down the key. Hey, you saved me back there. If you can take a life, I can save one. Hope it was worth it.
