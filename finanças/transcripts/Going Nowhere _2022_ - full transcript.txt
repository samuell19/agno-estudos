[upbeat folk music playing] Josh, can you please just, um, -look at the storyboard here? -[Josh] Uh-huh. [Izzy] Me and my storyboard artists worked on these panels for, uh, about six years here. I don't want to toot my own horn, but, uh, there's been a lot of anticipation from the whole team about this project, so I just, uh... I'm very excited to get started. Okay. What's that? No, I think it's-- [Izzy] You're perfect right there. [birds chirping] -I'm Izzy. -And my name is Diana. And we're making a movie. And it's called The Seed. The Seed is an intimate neo-noir reflecting on both the overt and subvert oppression of women. Is there another way to say neo-noir? No? I just-- as a-- as a, you know... It's like a neo-noir. Not everyone knows what neo-noir is. Well, like, then we don't need their money. Okay. It's about the things that limit us. The possibilities in the future through plant life. The Seed is a film about the... [groans] Uh, apocalyptic? Fuck. [Izzy blows raspberry] This gorgeous woman sitting next to me, Diana Irvine, is our lead actress. [birds chirping] I-- I actually do think it's important to show vulnerability, Izzy, I think it's important to-- when you're asking for money to, like, endear yourself. It's okay, just be human. Our fundraising goal is 600 tho-- [dog barks in distance] That's always the thing on crowdfunding stuff. It's like, "Okay, why this--" you know, "Why this project?" Like, what about it is so special? Like, why our film, you know? Yeah. Are you gonna donate? [both exhaling] Yeah. Deep need. Yes. -And you feel it. -[Izzy sobs] Oh, Iz. Oh, Iz. [Izzy cries] -[indistinct sobbing] -Oh, no, you're actually upset? Oh, I thought you were acting for a second. I was like, "That's good." Our fundraising goal is $600,000. Any amount helps. [upbeat folk music playing] [all cheering] [Josh] Howdy. We're making a movie! Yeah! [knocking on door] -Hey! -Hey, Iz. Hey. -[Izzy] Road trip. So fun. -Hey, Josh. -What's with the camera? -[Josh] Hey. My brother's gonna do behind the scenes stuff for us. It's gonna be great for marketing. [Diana] Okay. So he's gonna follow us in his car? -[Josh chuckles] -[Izzy] No, he's gonna, um... he's coming with us 'cause you got a big old car here. [Diana] I didn't know that so I just gotta, um-- He's got these, um, camera cases too, so just, uh... [Diana] Uh-huh. [Josh] You still live with your parents? Yeah. -Yeah. -Dude. You said you were gonna look into the COVID protocols? [Diana] Yeah, so that binder back there, that's the whole-- that's all of it. [Izzy] Oh, I thought these were your lines. [Diana] No, no, so that's the protocols for the state and the city, um, that we're gonna be in. And then also just my suggestions for basic protocol on set. [Izzy] This whole-- this whole-- this whole thing is-- -[Diana] Mm-hmm? -Did you read the whole thing? -[Diana] I compiled it. -You wrote it? [Diana] Well, I compiled it. [Izzy] But I think we're fine in the car. I think I'm gonna take mine off because it's just, like, you know. It's just too much in the car. [Diana] It is a long drive, I guess. [Izzy] It's three days. It's three days, Diana, I mean, come on. -I'll skim it. -[Diana] No, don't skim it. I mean, you know, you got plenty of time to read it. You can actually read it, but we're okay because we're-- you know, we're effectively-- a-- a family. There's also a section in there about intimacy and physical intimacy. No touching, no hugging, definitely no kissing. We can't have any, like, on set romances or any like, hooking up or anything like that. You hear that Josh? No hooking up. -I think that's a good rule. -[Diana] Okay. I think that's an important rule. I think well done for making that rule. Uh, I think, yeah, obviously no hooking up. I mean, that's the best way to get sick for lots of different reasons. Right, Diana? You know some-- you know a couple things about that. -Don't put that in. -[Diana] What? Izzy. [paper rustling] How much longer? [Diana] Today? Like, six hours. Thanks for driving. [upbeat folk music playing] Thanks so much for asking me. I think it's really important that I, in fact-- yeah, I think this is-- this is why you're here to-- so that I can share all of my, you know, thoughts. Making this film... you know, it's just... I've always dreamt of making a film. [Diana] Have you directed a film before? I have observed from afar many, uh, very powerful directors and from that, I have gleaned excellent techniques and I will bring that to this production and I'm very excited about it. [exhales] [sighs] Okay, not all-- You can stop now. Oh, I am starving. -This looks so good. Great. -Yeah. Did you just-- did you just use the public bathroom? Number two, so... I... I washed my hands already, Diana. Yeah, no, just, you know, for safety. Yeah, but the episode should be airing soon. I hope that, you know, when I see Matt, he'll tell me if it was good or not because I haven't heard anything. [Izzy] Did they like your suggestions about the character? Yeah, the director was, like, all for it. At first, a little resistant, but then was just really into me taking ownership. [Izzy] And the wig that you brought, did they end up using that? No, no, they didn't. When that comes out and then when this comes out. -[Izzy] Yeah. -Together it's gonna be so good. I really want my reps also to just, like, see me in a new light and I think that- [Izzy] They didn't drop you? I thought they dropped you? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. They just said that we should, you know, have a talk when I get back. -[Izzy] To part ways? -Um, no, no, no, no, no. I mean that's, you know, I mean, I might decide that I want that. -But I think they just--- -[Izzy] Right. They just want to touch base. [Izzy] Got it, got it. You know, they-- I need to tell them where I'm at and they need to know how I feel. [Izzy] Yeah, totally. There's gonna be an enormous amount of momentum for you after this, I think. Yeah, yeah. Oh, I can't wait. -I need that. -[Izzy] Yeah. -I need that momentum. -[Izzy] Yeah. -See the sign. -[Izzy] Yeah. Really, just a sign that it's gonna keep going. [Izzy] Yeah. Um, so you were supposed to have gotten off about eight miles ago. [Josh] Exit 75. And let me try to find the name of the road. [Josh] It's called "Exit 75." I just feel like we're going in circles a little bit. [Izzy] Well, we'll go in a circle for this... -[Diana] Okay. -...but we're not-- we're going in a pretty straight line otherwise. [upbeat folk music playing] Josh, thank God that you are here. This is absolutely terrifying. -Oh, shit! -What? What? I forgot to bring my toothpaste. I'll just... I'll just use some water. [Diana] Dude, you can use my toothpaste. -Really? -[Diana] Yeah, it's okay. It wasn't in the protocols though. It's okay. [Diana spits] [muffled speaking] Did you brush your teeth yet? [Diana gargles] You have to brush your teeth tonight, Josh. [Diana grunts, spits] He has this thing about brushing his teeth. -It's gross. -[Diana] Mm-hmm. -Oh, my God. Oh, my God. -What? Ew, I don't know, there's something on the floor, there's something there. Gotta wipe it. Do you have any more of those wipes? -[Diana] It's like tar. -Tar? [Diana] Did you tell her that we're here? -Did, like-- -[Izzy] No, I texted her. [Diana] Okay. [Izzy] She didn't text me back. I think she does. [Diana] She didn't text you back? [Izzy] Well, like, I don't-- [Diana] Does she know we're coming today? [Diana] Oh, my God, this is so beautiful. [Izzy] Oh, my God. [Diana] Oh, my God, it's beautiful. Do you think we can eat that corn or is it like, uh-- like, uh, ornamental corn? -[Izzy] Wait, what is that? -[Diana] What? -[horse stamping] -Oh, my God. [Izzy] Oh, my God, that is beautiful. -[Diana] Oh, my God. -[Josh] Oh, wow. Wow. [Izzy] Di, there's a tree, what the fuck? -[Diana] I'm sorry. -[Josh] Jesus. -Hi, Izzy. -[Izzy] Hi! -How you doing? -[Izzy] I'm good. How are you? What a beautiful farm you have. This work for you? [Izzy] Yeah, I think it'll work. Diana was telling me how incredible you looked on the horse when you were driving in. -[Devon] Oh, my God. Thank you. -Oh, yeah. Well, I used to ride so I just-- I miss it, you know? -You used to ride? -Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. -What kind of riding? -What did you do? Um, like, a mix of little-- a little English and, um, uh, the-- the-- the-- you know. Yeah, cool. -That's awesome. -Yeah. -There is a guy here. -Yeah? He's been looking for you. -Wait, does he have a poof? -He does. He keeps asking about the WiFi. [Man] Dude, you gotta wear your mask. I'm six feet, bro! Oh, there he is. Hi, Matt! -Hi. -What's up? -He's my producer. -[Devon hums] -He's amazing. Um... -[Devon] Okay. -He grows on you. -[Devon] All good. -I'll let you settle in. -[Izzy] Amazing. Well, yeah, you guys should definitely hang out. -I think you'll really-- -Yeah. We will. It'll-- we'll-- I'll see ya. Why did you just say that? It's so awkward, Izzy. [Izzy] I want you to be friends. [Diana] Yeah, but, like... [Diana groans] [Izzy] The Seed is set in a barn, which is why we're in Kentucky here. I really wanted to combine rural America with a sort of dystopian view, sort of superimpose that on-- on it. Luckily, I have family friends who own a barn here in Kentucky. This image here, I think really encapsulates the film, you know, somewhat surrealist, somewhat noir. We had to, um... scale back a little bit on, um-- on these ideas just, uh, for budgetary concerns, so disregard all of the, um, protective gear, but, um, that was the original intent. I love this, Josh. Little movement. Most of my character work starts with-- with costume and-- and within the costuming, starts with the feet. My feet touch the earth. It's how I stay grounded. So I need to look down and go, "That's Delta." You know, from here up, I'm Diana and from here down, Delta. So it's a-- it's a big part of my process. [Josh] Acting. Are shoes as important to you? Yeah. Yeah. -I think it's important... -[Josh] Okay. ...for a character... to get into character. [Josh] To get in some shoes. -It's a-- wardrobe. -[Josh] Mm-hmm. [Josh] Are those good pants for horseback riding? -Are there horses in this? -No. If you put a horse in this, I can ride it. I just didn't do the world-building for that, um, when I did my research. Um, I didn't think about horses. Okay, that's fine. But we could ask Izzy. I-- um, I can-- I can prep that, I can prep that. Then I am gonna... put my pants on. [Josh] Great! -So... -[Josh] So... Gotta take these pants off to get these pants on. [Josh] Yeah, totally, absolutely. Uh, I'm gonna go talk to Izzy about the horses. -Thank you. -[Diana] Yeah, yeah. Well, it's a survival film. So, um, if there-- if it-- if we're still in that range, then we're good. [Josh] Okay. Yeah, for sure. Okay, bye. Um, well, I... I-- I think everything has gluten in it, Di. -Okay, that's-- that's fine. -I'm so sorry. No, no, no, no worries. I just-- I just won't to eat. -[Izzy] Okay, so-- -Hey! -Oh, Geoff, hi. -Hey, I made it. You made it? You're-- Geoff, you're late. Yeah, I had to take care of something. What's with all these cameras? -Matt, this is Jeff. -[Geoff] Hey, 'sup, man? This is our DP, Alec has won a lot of awards. We're super lucky to have him and let me introduce you to our co-- your co-stars, um, Diana and, um, Devon, this is Geoff. -Hey, ladies. -Hey. Ma'am. While I have you all here, I've just got some, uh, forms for you to sign. -Here you go. -[Izzy] Safety first. -[Matt] Safety first. -At all times. [Matt] Just some standard contracts, you know, release forms, yadda, yadda, yadda, boring, boring, boring. Yeah, you can just sign at the bottom. That's right, you can skip three through, uh, seven. [Izzy] It's just right there. This is just to release production from responsibility if something goes down... which of course it won't 'cause we've got Izzy in charge. Am I right? Sound good? -[Izzy] Hey, what's up? -Hey. Try to distract them when they're looking at it. If they read the whole thing, they might have more questions. -Oh, what kind of questions? -[Matt] Here we go. Why does it say that "the production is not responsible if any of us catches any kind of--" If you get sick, we can't actually tell where it came from, right? So you don't know that it came from here. You know what I mean? We can't-- I don't know, I mean, like, if all of us got sick, I think it'd be pretty obvious. -[Devon] Hey-- hey, Matt? -Yes, ma'am. I'm just wondering why that part is handwritten on the back? [Matt] Sure, that was, uh, that's-- that's-- that's a little touch from me. Bottom line is if you don't fill out these forms tonight, we can't film tomorrow. So just sign at the bottom. -[Izzy] Hey, guys? -[Matt] Thank you, brother. Who, um, wants some wine? No, no, we're working tomorrow, so. [Izzy] Oh, yeah, totally. -[Devon] Um, I'll have some. -[Izzy] Okay, cool. [Matt] I got it, the initials work. -[Alec sneezes] -[Matt] Bless you. Just sign at the bottom and, uh-- and, uh, I'll date it for you if you want me to. Yep, thank you, brother. Um, are we doing the read through tonight or tomorrow morning? [Matt] Oh, we actually have enough time for either a read through or load in, so a real Sophie's choice. You didn't schedule time for a load in, what the-- [Matt] I can squeeze one in, but then we've got to pull up the call time by two and a half hours. -Matt, she'd have to do the-- -[Matt] No she doesn't. All right, y'all, so what we're gonna do is we're gonna pull the call time up tomorrow by about two and a half hours to make room for the load in. That's about 4:30 a.m., not too bad, not too bad at all. [Izzy] That's fine, I've done that before. [Matt] Easy pe-- Oh, and hey, not gonna print new call sheets. Why waste paper, yeah? So just do the math. Subtract about 150 minutes from whatever it is now and that's your call time, 4:30. Gotta save those trees. Right, Diana? I was actually wondering, Matt, um, how the episode is coming together, how the edit is, and when is it gonna-- The episode. Our episode. -Yeah, I'm dying to know. -Oh, my gosh. Also, it was so fun working with you and I'm glad we get to do it again. Oh, me too. I'm really glad we get to do it again because that episode has changed a lot. Okay, cool. I'm excited to see it. I'll mark my calendar. When is it coming out? It's coming out next month and it's not gonna look anything like you remember. Primarily from your character's perspective. Cool, can I still get the footage for my reel? You can't get the footage anymore, contractually and legally, because, uh... You know what? Take a deep breath in. -Exhale. -[both exhaling] One more time. Deep breath in. You're not in it anymore. We re-casted. Exhale. [exhales] Let that part out of your system. -Matt, sorry. -We had to recast the part. You did everything right. We were just looking at it and thought maybe somebody else. -Wait, sorry, I'm-- I'm lost-- -[Matt] Don't be sorry. No, no, Di. Don't be sorry. Because now we've got The Seed, huh? Let's leave the past in the past. It's not even smart to talk about it. You recast me? We did recast you, but that was then, this is now, and now you're first on the call sheet, babe. And I think this is redemption. Hold that thought. Hey, Geoff. Geoff, Geoff, Geoff. It's actually- whoa, we've gotta distribute these. Protocol, you know what I mean? Want some wine? -[Geoff] Yeah, I do. -[Matt] Got it. I would actually love some wine, too. -[Matt] Yeah? Okay. -Yeah. -[Matt] Sure. -Thanks. Are you okay? Are you okay? -[Diana] Oh, I'm so good. -[Matt] All right. I just-- I just changed my mind. Really happy to be here. Thank you so much. And hey, I hate that we had to do it like this, but I know you can handle it. -You know what? -Yeah? We'll just-- you'll get me on the next one, right? [Matt] I will get you on that-- you know, I got you on this one. -How about that? -Can I get some more wine? Or actually something stronger. Do we have any-- Is that normal for, like-- to do, like, the whole roll and get cut? Um, it does happen to some people. [Diana] Yeah, yeah, for sure. And you know-- you know people make-- make-- make choices, I mean, editing-- a movie is made three times, right? When it's-- when it's written, when it's shot, and when it's edited, so, um, there's a lot of... there's a lot of changes that happened. I'm just gonna-- um, I'm gonna run to the bathroom. -And then I'll be back. -[Izzy] Okay. Can you not? Just don't-- -[Devon] What is happening? -Just don't talk to her, okay? She's-- it's-- it's-- it's just happened a lot, okay? So please just don't say anything. Are these guys gonna be filming the whole time? Um... yeah. [Alec] Izzy, this is so weird. I'm gonna need you to blur my face out of all of this stuff. -I'm gonna go to sleep. -[Izzy] Sorry. Yeah, I'm gonna see how Diana is. Okay. Is this your first movie, too? Yeah. -Yeah. -Cool. Yep. It's gonna be great. It's gonna be great. -Good night. -[Devon] Night. Hey, Josh. Do you know where I'm staying? [Josh] Uh... [crickets chirping] Good morning. Guess what day it is today? It's the first day of my movie! And I'm just, um... I'm just really happy. I'm really happy. I have been on sets for ten years... as the assistant to somebody else and guess-- guess what? Not anymore! This time, it's my set... and I'm not an assistant. [laughs] It's so good. I'm so happy. [sighs] If I can do it, so can you. Keep going. [upbeat folk music playing] [video playing] -Oh, hey, Geoff. -Hey, morning. -Hi. -Yeah. Hey, um, is my boom guy here yet? Oh, yeah, buddy, we cut him. You-- you what? We cut him. [imitates scissors] [sighs] Motherf-- -[water splashing] -Dude. [Geoff] What's your job? [Alec] Don't you have some, like, acting exercises to do? -[Geoff] No. -[Alec] That's really too bad. [Geoff] How high's that go up? [Stefan] Hey, um, have a sound pack for you. So are you comfortable with this? -[Devon] Yeah, that's fine. -[Stefan] Down here. Okay. [Matt] Hey, Diana. -You look bad. -Okay. Hey, Matt, sorry, do you have an Ibuprofen? Nah, Ibuprofen? No. Wait, you're not sick, are you? -No, no, I just have a headache. -Okay, are you sure? Because we're all getting tested again tomorrow. -Yeah, I promise I'm fine. -Okay. Um, Josh, do you-- no. Did you drink too much? [Josh] Nice costume, man. It's just my regular clothes, man. [Josh] Hey, Izzy, why does this guy have a beeper? Um, I don't know, he's just, like, a nostalgic kind of guy. [Josh] Hey, Izzy, how do you and Geoff know each other? Uh, just-- uh, I don't know, like, out and about. -[Josh] Ew. -[both] Out and about. Rehearsal, everybody! Okay, so tell me about your limp. You push your hip forward and then you roll with it. Okay, two more times. Delta Ray. [tense music playing] [Izzy] It's empty. [straw rustling] [Devon] You don't know what's in that. I do now. High levels of nitrogen, little phosphorus. Potassium carbonate. Someone tried to burn something here. -Maybe a body. -[honking] -[honking continues] -Okay, sorry. I'm so sorry, guys. I'm so sorry. Um... [Diana] Okay, while we're holding, are we gonna be going in any tighter or? Because I'm saving a lot for the-- Yeah, no, we'll go tighter. Just-- just-- just a moment. We'll-- We'll-- Diana. We'll... Go check it out. Yeah, I'll definitely go check it out. Okay. Like, now. Oh, like, right now, right now. Got it. -[Felipe] Hi! -Hey, can I help you? -[Felipe] Hey. -Can I help you? -[Felipe] Yeah. -Okay. -I'm here for a set visit. -Oh, okay. Uh, normally when you come to see somebody on set, you're coming to watch them film, so you wouldn't drive up slamming on your horn. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. That's exactly what I did. [Matt] That's exactly what you did. -Matt, this is Felipe. -Uh, Felipe? Felipe. -[gasps] Felipe! -[Izzy] Hi. -Hey. -I'm so sorry. -[Felipe] All right. -[Izzy] It's okay. [Felipe] Oh, my God. Hi, Felipe. You're here! -You're doing it. -I'm doing it. Um, how are you? -How was the drive? -[Felipe] It was wonderful. I saw a bird that I think was pretty much the same bird just followed me half the ride. I met a girl in Wichita. -Wichi-- Wichi-- Wichita. -Wichita. Her name was Chastity and, uh, I spent the night just, like, holding her while she cried and it was transcendent. So you with the, um, stranger on the way-- With Chastity. Wow, okay, so, um, just by the way, so we can't hook up with anybody here. Diana's-- It's Diana's rules, so. Just for s-- you know, safety. -Okay. -Oh, hi, guys. This is Felipe. He's our financier. He's, you know, big man on campus. He's the reason that we're all here. So, I think, like, let's give him a really big round of applause. -Yay, Felipe! -[Felipe] Stop! -[Izzy] So fun. -Stop it. Stop it, you guys. [laughs] Stop, stop. [Matt] All right, should we keep going? -[Felipe] Let's do it. -Yeah, come on guys. -[Felipe] Yeah, let's do it. -[Izzy] Come on. Geoff. -We'll talk. -[Izzy] Great. [Felipe] Let's make a movie! Hi! Thanks for so much, like, for all of this. Oh, my God, it's my pleasure. I'm so excited. Everyone-- Actually, can I get a headset? -Oh, Stefan. -Oh, yeah, sure. Can we get a headset for Felipe? No? No more headsets? -Um... -Um... Yeah, that's fine. Oh, my God. Thank you. -Yeah, sure. -Okay. That's really sweet. That's, like, amazing 'cause you already know the script. [Izzy] Okay. And action. [Geoff] What y'all doing on my land? Actually, just so I'm not, like, get in the way again, can I sit? 'Cause I've been driving and my legs are, like, killing me. [Felipe] I just don't want to complain again about it-- You want to sit because you've been driving? Yeah, that's fine. I'm so sorry, of course, take a seat. Thank you so much. Thank you. -[Izzy] Um, yeah, no problem. -[exhales] That's better. Why does it just keep... -[Devon] Hey. -[Diana] Hey. You're on my target. Um-- oh! Oh, oh, wow. -Sorry. -[Devon] It's all right. Wow. This is... that's cool. -You wanna try? -No, no, no. [Devon] Why not? Come on. -Left forearm. -Okay. Yep. -Grab it right below my hand. -Okay. Nope. Below. Yeah. Nice. -Okay. Two fingers. -[Diana] Mm-hmm. Just gonna pull it right back onto the string. -Into here. Okay. -Yep, that's nice. -Okay, you can go. -Oh, my gosh. I want you to square your hips up. -Okay. -Okay. This arm straight out. -[Diana] Mm-hmm. -Great. Now pull this one back. You're gonna anchor your thumb to the corner of your mouth. -Yeah? When you're ready. -Mm-hmm. -Okay. Yep. -Okay. Gotta keep it square. -Okay. -Yep. Good. Nice. Yep. Straight. Oh, my God, I'm sorry. It's really scary. -It's okay. -I'm so sorry. -No, you're doing well. -Okay, I just feel-- Good. That's good. You got it. -I'm just nervous. -Don't be. Okay. There you go. Yep. Way back. -Arms straight. Eyes forward. -Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Slightly down. Good. When you're ready. Keep your eyes forward. -Yes. Sorry. -Just release the two fingers. -Wow! -That was actually really good. I've never done that before! Well, you did a really good job. -Thank you. -You're so welcome. -Wanna do it again? -No, no, no, no, no, no. -No? -No. You take that. -Okay. -But I'm really grateful. You're so welcome. And now it's a new-- new skill of mine. As a thespian I can tell people I've-- I've done it before at least. Cool, well, I'll leave you to it. I don't wanna-- I don't wanna im-- impede. -[Devon] All right. -I'll see you. Ooh, I need to make sure you understand your job. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, so what happens? Before 11, girls get in free, dude, you can't charge them. Chicks in free, dicks pay. Yeah, chicks free, dicks-- Yeah, yeah, yeah, you get it. Make it a rhyme. Okay, it's not a club.

Dinner's good? [Matt] Yeah, no, we should-- we should-- [Izzy] Yeah, it's really yummy. Who made it? -I think it's really yummy. -[Matt] Yeah, it's delicious. Soul food, that's that supper. -I'm just gonna go eat outside. -No, Di, Di, Di. We're a pod, so we're actually all safe. -[Izzy] Yeah, we're a pod. -This is good. We're safe. Out of all the pods I'm in, I trust this pod the most. Are you-- are you in more than one pod? -[Geoff] What does that mean? -Yeah. Well, it's like a pod of pods. I don't think that's-- I don't think that's how it works. [Geoff] That's not how it works at all. -CDC. -Okay. Okay, sure. You're right. I think it's okay, Di. It's-- we just, like, cleaned-washed our hands and stuff. Do you want me to get you some more food? -No, no, I got plenty. -Okay. So I've been meaning to ask you, is this your first feature? I did a TV movie last-- last spring, but this is the first time I'm a lead, -so... -[Geoff] Amazing. This is my first time, so, I mean, give me some pointers. [Diana] Yeah, 'cause you've done a lot of theater and stuff? [Geoff groans] I mean, it's not really theater per se. -It's more like dinner theater. -Um, hey, guys. Um, in the, uh, spirit of community and sharing, we're actually all gonna, um, share the cost of food for production. -[Stefan] Is that a joke? -[Alec] Yeah. I mean, I thought Felipe was bankrolling this whole thing. [Felipe] I'm getting a phone call. Bonjour. Oui. -[Izzy] Uh... -[Matt] Okay, listen. Honestly, we have a tight budget, all right? -So, uh-- -[Alec] What budget? -You're not paying us. -Yeah, they are. [Alec] They're paying you? -What? -Oh, great. Okay. I see that we've reached a consensus. Beautiful. Um, so production will be covering the cost of food and thank you so much for all speaking your truth. It's very helpful for me, so great. [Geoff] When she says from now on, does that mean we have to pay for this one? 'Cause it's tasted way better when it was free. How are we actually going to cover that? Um... Felipe, you know, has donated so much already, so, uh... [indistinct chatter] Uh, well, you know, um, my unemployment check I think will clear at the end of this week and then I can probably cover half of it and then you could maybe cover the other half maybe? I, uh... Oh, um, okay, no, that's okay. No, it's my project and I will shoulder, um, the costs. You sure? 'Cause I don't wanna be a dick. Yeah, no, it's my choice and it's my voice. I love that rhyme. [Diana] Josh, you're filming this too? [Josh] Unpaid work. [Matt] Grab a chicken wing. Grab a chicken wing. [Diana] Yeah, there's more that's here for you guys. Hi. Hello. Yes, yes. Um, my name is Is-- Isabel, Isabel Shill, S-H-I-L-L. Yes, that's right. Hi, Candace. Yes, so nice to-- uh, hello. I was wondering, um, uh, if there's any way for me to increase my credit card limit on my Visa? Um, uh, it's already-- okay. No. Okay. Um, that's fine. That's fine. How about... um... how about on my dad's card? [Josh] What the fuck? [exhales] Okay. Focus, focus. [exhales] Okay. Focus. Big Geoff to Little Geoff, real talk right here. That picket fence.

[Stefan] No. [Izzy] That's a safety hazard, Alec. -[Izzy] Geoff. -[Alec] Geoff, please. -[Geoff shouts] -What are you doing, man? -[Diana] Morning! -[Izzy] Hi, Diana! -[Diana] Hey, what's up? -Hey, good morning. [Alec] Izzy, can you clear frame please? [Geoff sighs] Did you-- did you just touch my prop? What? No, no. I would never. [Alec] Uh, yeah, sure. Whatever. [Izzy] I-- okay, guys, guys, I think the communication is breaking down a little bit here. -Please don't touch the camera. -Just checking the frame. [Alec] Geoff, get-- Jesus! -Josh... Six feet! -[Josh] Okay, dude! Sorry, Jesus. Stop. Like a fucking zoo. [Diana vocalizing] -Geoff, get away from me. -When do we rehearse? [Alec] Hey, Geoff, clear frame. This is all frame. Thank you.

Yes. I would like to report a work violation in Kentucky. Not LA. No. I've brought it up several times and production doesn't seem interested in following the regulations that, as far as I know, state and local governments have issued. No, I have a list. What? Oh, sorry, what? My membership number? Um, uh, I thought I could make an anonymous complaint? That's what it said on the website at least. Right. Right, I-- There aren't any SAG performers on this shoot. Well, that was such a funny joke. No, it's not. I am not in SAG but I am SAG eligible. Yeah. Oh. Sure. I-- mm-hmm. Well-- well-- well, thank you. Thank you for all that you do for-- Hello? Um, I'm just... [sighs] Hello? [ominous music playing] [paper rustling] Morning. [Izzy] So, here, um, I'm really, really excited about this. This is the miracle plant here. It came to me in a dream and it has the ability to inseminate women. Um, and that is how it saves the world. Yeah, it kind of kept appearing in my unconscious mind, um, over and over and over again. Hey, now. I was just looking. Looked like you were touching. -Is this it? -[sighs] Maybe. -How do I know it's even real? -That's none of your business. If this is gonna save our species, I think it falls under the purview of something I'd like to know. This is it. -How's it work? -[Devon] Don't. It's genetics are malleable. [scoffs] What does that mean? It's double helix adapts to different species. Um, this is a moment of discovery for Russ, you know, as well as the audience. -[Devon] Yeah. -And I just want to make sure that we're all clear on the scientific language. The thing that's amazing about it is that it's actually all really possible. -It is? -[Devon] Yeah. [Izzy] In theory. Uh, let's shoot. Oh, okay, um, it's-- no. It's not possible, just so you know. It's not a thing. I made some breakthroughs with plants, cross pollinations that, in other circumstances, would never hybridize. Then with rats. I had some success with the jellyfish. I was on the verge of seeing if it could fertilize a human egg. That's when the ash came. -The ash. -The ash. But we've been on the run for about a week now. It needs some consistent photosynthetic opportunity in order to maintain the stability of its genetic structure. Yeah, sure. Male sperm would no longer be necessary. It's fine with me. But how would you even go about fertilizing a human egg then? Experiments are ongoing. -[Josh] Diana. -Oh, hey. -[Josh] Hi. -Hey. -[Josh] How are you doing? -Good, good. -I'm just working. -[Josh] Cool. I just have my script analysis happening right now. What I'm doing right now, actually, is I am working on my animal exercises. Delta Ray is a scientist, she's very smart. She is-- she is grounded and-- um, and wise and so for her, I've chosen a salamander. You know, really what that means is that I observe salamanders in the wild or watch YouTube videos and I just sort of go deep on their behavior. -Yeah. -[Josh] Neat. And, you know, the person who really-- really taught me this, um, is my acting teacher, Rudolph Eichner. He teaches the Eichner technique and I've been studying with Rudy for about ten years now, so, um, you know, if it wasn't for him, I... I wouldn't be in this place. Geoff, for example, Geoff is a badger, you know? He's got that energy to him. Because of Rudy, I can identify quickly, um, what people's animals are. He-- he's not cheap, but-- uh, but he is worth every penny and, you know, if I have to skimp, um, and pay, like, cheaper rent-- I-- I've moved, I have moved before because all I wanna do is-- is afford that class. If you bring people into the class, you get a discount. So-- um, so I have a lot of friends in that class. Yeah. Anyways, I-- I think I should get back to studying because we have an early call and I am behind. [Felipe] Terrible. -Hey. -Hello. So word on the street is you were the voice of [bleep] in [bleep] the Explorer. -That's the word on the street? -Oh, no, sorry. -Uh, Izzy told me. -Izzy told you that? Sorry, sorry, should she not have? No, I'm just kidding. Yeah, that was totally me. Uh, I-- I was. Cool. That's amazing. I've been trying to get into voice over if you have any tips. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. There's, like, one golden rule. -One. -There's one rule. Okay? And it's that the microphone can hear your facial expressions. Say this line with a frown. -Okay? -Okay. [Felipe] Um, uh, "This food is unacceptable." This food is unacceptable. [Felipe] Okay, now say it with, like, a big smile. This food is unacceptable. Big frown. Bigger. Bigger. Frown with your cheeks. Frown with your cheeks more. And now say, "This food looks terrible." This food looks terrible. And now, like, a big smile and feel the difference. Feel the difference. Smile with your ears, like-- like, all-- like, lift it all up, lift it all up, and then say, "This food is terrible." This food is terrible. [Felipe] Do you feel the difference? -Oh, my God. -[Felipe] Right? It's, like, opposite. 'Cause you're changing your tool. Oh, yeah. First the ash, now acid rain. We're done for. -You're not leaving, are you? -[Felipe] Diana? -Sorry. Diana. -Yeah? I-- [Felipe sighs] You know, Diana, okay, babe, I need you to-- have you ever heard the phrase -"Use your diaphragm"? -Yes. Okay, I need you to, like, take your diaphragm, wring it out, and when you say your lines, like, squeeze the tension back in, and say the lines through your nose as opposed to just like, keeping them in your mouth. -Okay, Okay. -Okay? -[inhales] It feels trapped. -It feels trapped. -Let it-- let it out. -Okay. -[Felipe] You know? -Okay. Thank you. -Yes. Yes. -Okay, cool, cool. Is that-- is that okay, Izzy? I-- I think that maybe, um, that we should do that -at the end of the take. -Good, yeah. [Felipe] Me giving notes and stuff? Yeah, I think it would be good if we did that at-- at the end. -Yeah. -[Alec] We're rolling right now. Yeah, yeah, that's a good-- that's a good point. That's a good point, that's smart. Maybe you could come and... -[Felipe] Moment. -...sit down again. Yeah, yeah. Do you have any notes for me? Oh, no, no, no. Devon, you're, like, you blow everyone away. You're the best actor here. All good. Okay, all right, cool. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Awesome, awesome, so... -I just, um-- -[Diana vocalizing] [Felipe] What's going on? -[Diana] Yeah, hmm. -I think that maybe, um-- I think that maybe, we should go again. We're going again. Is anybody listening to me? -Sorry. -Sorry. And action! -Hot nurse. Hot nurse. -[Matt laughing] So, that means quiet, everybody. [cricket chirping] It's not easy being the leader. I think I could have maybe done a little bit of a better job communicating with my team. I need to rally, and get people back on board. I'm gonna pull it together. Everything is great.
