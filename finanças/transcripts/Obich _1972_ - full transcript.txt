BULGARIAN Cinematography FEATURE FILM STUDIOS CREATIVE TEAM "Mladost" AFFECTION scenario Alexander Karasimeonov composer Simeon Pironkov director Lyudmil Staykov Where to? I asked where you're going? - Is it free? - No, wait! Taken! Decided to stay alone? Fine! Only, please don't do anything stupid! Relax, and don't do anything stupid! I know a manager of a holiday center I'll provide a room. I'm sure! It will take us half an hour. Come on! Shall we? Come on! Don't leave me without luggage! This bag is mine! You didn't buy it! Neither you nor my mother! Come on, Peyo! Sorry! - You have the tickets? - I gave them to you! Ah yes, here they are! Starring: Violeta Doneva Nevena Kokanova Stefan Danailov Nikolai Binev Banko Bankov Ivan Kondov Katia Dineva Andrey Chaprazov Svetozar Nedelchev It is easiest to take offence! Feel offended by something and run! I could do the same, more than one time! Can you tell me why are you unhappy? We don't care enough for you or are you missing something? Tell! Your mother should not have acted like this today! But you - did you ever try to understand her? Did you ever try to share something with her? Tell her what you think or what bothers you? Something about your school or your friends? We want you to be happy home. Just as if we didn't exist or we were strangers. Leave it to me! You know I'm very busy! I'd prefer not to get into these details! But I know it affects her! Sometimes I think you hate us! That you hate everything we've given you! And now you in this compartment with your bag! What do you think? That we are selfish? That we only care about our convenience and our belongings, about making money? Bourgeois parents! Oh, now it's in vogue to blame the parents! But tomorrow you'll be first to reproach us that we did not provide you with the essentials! Right for you to do it! And your mother? Her work is not easy! Now one has to be commited to his work... if you do not want others to get ahead. And this story about Irina's apartment! You touched me very much! Don't forget that when you lost aunt, I lost my sister! I understand that it's not easy for you! But do you ask how it is for me? I knew there was a war, that it was dangerous. But for a doctor? I thought that at least in the hospital ... Irina, You're perfectly sure you must go? I am! Here's the key, it's at your disposal! Just if you play music, don't make it too loud! They are angry above! In the newspapers! Newspapers give ads for apartments, don't you know? - I know, but we have to wait! - Why? Understand that it's not convenient to disclose this story so soon! What is inconvenient? What is inconvenient in this story? Say it! Okay, okay! Find an agent to do the job. - Oh, no! You'll find an agent! You are the heir! - Listen, give away the key! - No! Why? Iri left it to me to keep until she's back! She will not come back and you know it very well! Give me the key! - I will not give it! - Why? Because I know what it means you! Because I heard your whole conversation! Aren't you ashamed?! I cannot believe she's made only because of the sale! You chose Irina before her! She's certainly noticed it... And felt badly about it! She's a mother... Maybe selling apartment... was an opportunity to bring you back home! Make you feel needed in our environment, our home! More evenly! More evenly! Yes! Yes! Watch out! - What is it? - No, look! What? - What is it? - No, look! What? Krasimira, listen to music! I'm tired of saying the same thing all the time! Lift your head! Yes! More rhythmically! More rhythmically! More rhythmically! I got the results of the exams! Wrong, wrong! How many times should I repeat! - You should move evenly! - We're tired! But you do not listen to the music! Okay, okay! End! A break! What about exams? Nothing about exams! I wasn't accepted! And by a few hundredths! But what to do with myself? You're always very busy! You're always very busy! I barely remember seing you home together! If you speak, it's always a quarrel! You don't love! You improve your mood for a bit only when you buy something. And then... Why are you silent? Tell! They are here! They are here! My daughter. Incredible! I would never guess you have such a daughter! Well, she was very nice! Nice to meet you. Once again, thank you for everything. You're always welcome! And take it easy. I'll take care. If there's anything wrong, you can call me. Take care. Welcome! I hope you'll be satisfied. This time of the year... It's quiet but beautiful. I hope you'll be satisfied. This time of the year... It's quiet but beautiful. Hey, where? It's here. Very funny! This is our only apartment! The others are housed in ordinary rooms. Make yourself at home. The dinner is in an hour. - So you are a student? - No. - You work? - Something like that! I completed nursing courses. Nursing? Not bad. Difficult but noble. - Well then... I'll go. - O.K. I'm going. Excuse me, the breakfast hours are over and you did not come. We were worried down there. And last night you didn't come down for the dinner. Alright. This is beyond my duties, but for you... I promised your father not to let you get bored. Don't worry. I'm never bored. - Even when you are alone? - Especially then. I can get bored with a foolish talk. You are right. Stupid conversation with a foolish man, this is the worst thing in the world! Sometimes I wonder, what is all this progress... when the human stupidity remains as it was. And for whom do you create art? Is this watermelon yours? - Which watermelon? - On the wall! Ah! Still life! You see... They've built such a nice house and I felt that something was missing. I have a wonderful library. Do you want me to give you something to read? I have come here to rest! Flying all the time! In the morning, at noon and at night! All the time! What's going on here cannot be explained or related! You have to see it with your own eyes to understand the strength and the faith of these people! We are not on front, but it seems for them it does not matter! They kill. Kill methodically, quietly, coolly. Is it out of fear, wild cruelty? I do not know! The hatred in me which seemed gone so years ago resurfaces in me! When faced with this madness I cannot back down! Need to be hard to the end! However, it is so terribly tiring! I think I have a right to speak so? Am not too cruel? Here, on this earth, to ask such a question is completely unnecessary! In my hospital many people are dying. Much more than I used to see! This is something to which I cannot adjust. I would not have written about these things but if you took this decision... If so stubbornly you want to hold to this profession... You must be able to listen to death and to see it with your eyes! Sometimes I wonder, are we not fighting too long? Wasn't there enough war? Cannot we leave that to the others, and stay in our happy world... only caring for the ones we love? And I reply: we cannot! We cannot, while there is a struggle... ...and if it continues. You're writing that you miss me. Actually, you know, I miss you too. But I had to get here, where everything has a tragic cost... to appreciate the world that you have! To appreciate the peace and security we have, to appreciate you, my dear girl! I need you! Need you so! I don't know whether you'll understand everything I write... ...but I really need to see things in their complexity. Welcome! Welcome! Don't forget that lunch is at 12:30. and now... Let me! As you can see, here we are like one big family! Our new guest, here name is Maria. Architect Stanimirov. Manasiev - a researcher. Petrov - a journalist. And Kostov - a lawyer. Welcome! Combination of different vegetables and veal. I have to admit a secret. Nothing to do with ordinary beef stew. All subtlety is in the combination of vegetables with spices. But you'll see for myself. Try it, try it! - You feel it, right? - I do! Ah! Maybe on you this image makes no special impression. For me it is very dear. As far as I know, just two months before it's been done this team consisted not of 20 but of 40 people! The others would also be here if they were alive. Much has been written, my Girl, about this team. Many times I was asked to write memories of that time. I'll admit I have tried. But nothing comes out. Somehow I fail to convey the nature of things! I was at the same time a nurse and a doctor in the squad. And then for the first time even before I learned how to save from death, I learned to find it. Even more, I to cause death! When we had to discuss a death sentence in the squad, for a man who with his own hands committed 18 brutal murders within two months. His favorite pastime was taking pictures with severed heads! He had no right to live! He had no right! No right! For the three months prior to entering the squad I still lived carefree! There there was her cousin. Later I realized there was no cousin. The man had come to do the job. To look at these guys and girls imagining the revolution as a New Year party with boza instead of wine! And decide who will be to bear arms! Or to put it more clearly, who can kill or be killed in the name of freedom! When he realized that I study medicine, he told me that this is the best job! I asked him why and he replied: "This is the most direct way to help people! " We were together twice. And I never saw him again! I had to go into hiding, and in june he was killed somewhere in Etropol mountains. Welcome! Welcome! Today our little family has a holiday. One of us turned 45. Just do not tell I gave out his age. And, here's the culprit for today's celebration! Architect Stanimirov, this time your place is at the top of the table. Well, I... Yes! I wish you health and long life. You are very kind, but I'm turning 45, and that's a bit sad. You look much younger! Thank you, but this is temporary and deceiving. May I? I should probably tell you a well-known but brilliant thought that it does not matter how old a person is, but how he feels. The thing is that I feel exactly 45! I will reveal a secret. I am pleased with myself. - Good evening. - Good evening. Good evening. - Where's my place? - Of course next to the lady, Peter. The manager knows. Legal counselor. Accuracy and cautiousness. Next to the journalist. Go! Ah! Oh! Bravo, , bravo, bravo! We all congratulate our jubilee! Well, that is a surprise! This birthday I won't forget. I'll come here to celebrate mine! Bravo, bravo! Very sadly I could not I find the original candles. These were given to me by the church in the village. As you can see will do. Bravo! Stanimirov. Stanimirov. - Architect Stanimirov! - Yes! Will there be any music or no? Of course, by the way let our lady choose. - What? - A stotinka for the machine. Don't bother. It works without it. Stanimirov, we note 5 stotinkas on your account. Write down 5 levas for the entire evening. Something is wrong! I did not want that! It's okay. Everything is fine. I personally changed all the records. Not in your taste? - Stanimirov, don't akt as a simpleton. - Oh, yes, yes, yes! Excuse me. May I? It's good you came. We were so bored! If a man tells you that he feels best in a male company, do not believe it. We were gatting wild. I do not care! I am not a good dancer, but may I ask? Good you came. The most modern dance that the manager knows is foxtrot. Beside tango and foxtrot you will find nothing in the machine. But as a manager he is an absolute master. His taste is our taste. What do you think about this legal advisor? I feel that he's both a teetotaler, a vegetarian and a misogynist. But I think he does not care. And that annoys you! So good you came. We were very bored! That's possible, but I heard it already. - It's hard to be original. - The worse for you. - Are you angry? - I am. - Why? - Because! Now you are original. If you could walk on hands... I can't, but I can stand on head. Come on! - What? - Do it! - Here at the top the wind is strong. - Thank you. - Sorry about last night. - Why did you leave us? Well... I was just angry about the company. What do you blame the company for? Just normal peaople. The celebration, dancing, cake... Ah! Watch out! There's nothing wrong in it. There's nothing wrong, but it was all organized by the manager. It would have been different if it come out naturally. And I do not understand why everyone complies with what he says. He hung his own watermelons on the wall, loaded the machine with his old tangos. You all watch, grin, and nobody says anything! And did you say anything? Instead of getting irritated you should laugh of it. I have no time for this! Why are you in such a hurry? People are now dealing with other, more important, things, not serving flowers. These are our friends that are dealing with other things. Beware! Stanimirov is one of our best architects! The biologist, Manasiev lectures throughout Europe! Now just tell me that you are another miracle of nature and... ...I am finished! - Be calm, I'm just an ordinary journalist. - Eh! - What is it? Nothing. It's just taht this profession Of yours seems most obscure. - Why? - Why... If you need to write about something that you do not care about... ...or just cannot tell what you think about the matter, how do you write such a case? Well, in that case, I do not write! But if it's necessary? Do you have a friend? I do. Two even! - Really? Why, how? - It's very simple... One does not know about the other. Only I know. - Are you not unconfortable? - Well, this is a nuisance, ...because it takes a lot of time. No, this is not what I'm talking about! - I mean unconfortable in a different sense. - No! Let's say I go to the cinema form 6 to 8 with one... ...then tell him goodbye and start nightlife with the other. - What do you mean by nightlife? - You know, restaurants and other things... visiting people, dancing, drinking, debauchery. You're making up things? And if things get serious? In that case, I have a friend! He's always away. He's a radio-operator. We rarely see each other. It's not very nice, but it has advantages. I feel very free in relationship with my other friends. They know they I have someone like fiance whom they do not know... ...and therefore they leave me alone. Because in any other case it would seem quite abnormal that that I'm not close to anyone in the company. That I don't have a lover, if you want to be exact. Can you imagine the horror of getting close to a boy just because it is inconvenient not to have a cavalier. This boy can poison your life. That way everything is in order. Do you know how beautiful the moment of takeoff is? Why did you stand on your head last night? I thought you would have liked it. Comrade manager! Comrade manager! Who won? - Who won? - Everyone sees who won. What is it, Comrade Stanimirov? Why do you worry? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. - We were on a trip. - OK, we understand. The wind was enormous up there. Unfortunately we were not all there. It would have been even more fun. No doubt. May I ask you for a moment? Someone was looking for you on the phone. A male voice. Very nice, very polite. He presented himself as Nikolay. Seems his family name was unnecessary to tell. You probably know who it was? Thank you. Haemorrhage occurred 40 minutes ago. Until now, he had no complaints. I gave him the necessary assistance. Here! - Sister! X-ray first! - Yes, Dr. Volev! Call the doctor on duty! He's getting worse! What is it? Make a shot of calcium! Take it easy, nothing to be afraid of. - Syringe! - OK! Ah! Oh! I'll give it a try. Done. Thermometer! Dr. Borov, the picture. Breathe calmly and try to fall asleep. Medicines in 2 hours! - Take it in my office! - OK. - Do not leave the patient alone! - OK, Doctor! - Sister, I can stay. - If there is anything, call me. I'll take it away already? Yes, enough for today. Take it away. Good day. The last one today. The last room on the left. Doctor Stoyanov went through the glass again. That's normal for him. - What is it? - Nothing. I came to say goodbye. Today is the last day of my internship. - And you won't come here any more? - There's no need. - I am much obliged to you. - Eh! Can I call you when I'm leaving here? When you are leaving you will immediately forget hospital and everything related to it! That is obvious. And your friend is not a bad girl at all. Not bad. We'll split up. But you're almost healthy. You should've said you saw the results yesterday! If she wouldn't believe she could ask your doctor! It's not about my illness. Something else. Sorry, I do not know the details, but if she loves you, you should wait anyway... Sure. She is expecting a baby. It happened before we got to know. She said that this man did not exist for her any more. It was... a terrible accident. Before we met. Okay, okay. - Good day. - Good day. - Have you been waiting? - Only 5 minutes. - Excuse me, but... - No, do not worry. - So you're healthy now? - Well, almost. I only have one afternoon. At 8 I must be in my room. You're looking very well. Just need to be careful. - So we're still in hospital, right? - Okay, okay. Aren't you angry, that I called you? I didn't even expect. Did you know that we have not seen exactly one month? - Really entire month? - Really. I trully felt that. - Coffee. - Make it two coffees. - We're not in the hospital. - First box for 2 months. I do not believe, but... What's new with you? They say that in one month they will let me out. But I'm not allowed to continue studying for a year, will have to retake the course. What about you? Nothing. Just waiting for the assignment. I'll be preparing to enroll on medicine. From time to time I'll make a shot. I seem to have become a major specialist in it. After training a little on you. The whole thing, of course, is a talent. It is true. You were making them lightly. What happened to your girlfriend? - Please. - Thank you. We parted. She could not accept what happened. No matter what I said, she did not agree. She said the child is mine, I want it. And, of course, that it is not easy for her. I tried to understand her. And then, how to tell the parents, the friends. I know that these are details, but... there are so many of them. That's why I called you. Only you know! With nothing I can help you. I do not know how. The hospital is easy. You love her very much? Why do you ask that? Much. Do you have a friend? I do. I envy you. It seems to me that there is a real thing in those people who fly. You have to go. You will be late because of me. Just a little bit more. A man is waiting for you. Nikolai? I'm sorry to bother you. They were asking for you several times at home. I told them you were not in Sofia. It's about a series of injections. They insist that you've made them. - Intravenous? - Yes. For a child who was accustomed to you and won't let them be done by anyone else. They asked a few times when you'll be back. I did not know what to answer them. Why did not you call on the phone? I wanted to see you. I 'll call. I have their number somewhere. Fine. Otherwise, how are you? Someone else was looking for me? Yes, I almost forgot! Nikolai. Your friend. I gave him the phone number here. Yes, he called. If you need anything... Then... I'll go. Maria, I almost forgot! I bought you a sweater. I hope you enjoy it. I really do not understand it! Do you... If this key to the apartment of your aunt... If you have it... I'll take it to your mom. I can not tollerate this hell any more. Let her do there whatever she wants. Because you have nothing to do with this story, right? Because you've never had anything to do with me, nor with my mother, nor with Irina. You're dealing only with yourself and your work. And you know when to make a gift to make me feel sorry. Make me think that I am cruel, ungrateful ...because I don't understand you. This is why you've brought it, right? That's it, isn't it? No, I brought it because it gets cold here at night. I got news about Irina. They said she was gone. An official notification. No details. - Just that she's gone? - That's what they've said. Irina is dead. What is it? What happened? Irina, they said that you're not there any more. It will be very difficult for me now. Doesn't matter what happens to you, the important is to know what you want. I want to be like you. It's impossible. Everyone thinks and experiences things in their own way. I like the way you lived. Time will pass, and you will understand, that you like very different things. You'll want all people to be smart. To think exactly the way you think. What you're looking for will be more complicated. Richer and harder. And maybe then you'll find out that you do not like it that much. And that it is not so scary. After a major surgery, when the sick is healed... and one day goes down the stairs down to the exit... I want to run after him, to catch up with him... and tell him on the side: Hey you, until yesterday you could live the best way you could... but now your life... even if insignificant... has to change! For this life is no longer just yours. You have to become something more. You must start being a real person. Wherever you are, whoever you are. Run! Wonderful! Finally, we lived to see you! - Hello. - Hello. - How did you know... - You will not find out. - You! - No, no! Help me! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Hooligans! You should let us know Where you are going. - Why? - To contact you if necessary. I did not suppose you could need me so urgently. Not me, someone was looking for you on the phone. Some Nikolai. Didn't he ask you to tell me anything? - That he will call again? - No, he seemed in a hurry. Of course I did not tell him that you're in the woods with a company. Thank you. You've shown extraordinary wits. Innate sense of tact. Only you would have done better if you called me. - This Nicholas is the radio-operator? - Who? - Your friend. - No, just a guy. - What? - Nothing. I only thought... - You're still making a very good impression. - With what? With not giving me any advice, about how to do different things. - Someone did that? - No, but they were going to. Do you like coffee? Let's do some. Stove, contact, you know what to do? And find some cups! Should not I ask the permission first? - From whom? - From the manager. You're so scared of this manager! If he comes, it's me who invited you. That way no one should bother. - Three, how much sugar? - Very, very little. I put more. Let's make it somewhere in between. Four, five, enough. Well, Put them here. What is your marital status? Do not answer, if you do not want to. - I'm divorced. - Aha! Would you like me to tell you something? Why not? Tell me! There is a special moment in relations between a man and a woman. It's very specific, I do not know if you will understand. Different things can happen in a man's life. Really different. There are some hard times. Some very hard. And then this man may need help. Who else can help him, if not his wife? But it may happen that she does not understand or says that she does not care. He's left to handle it on his own. The best way he can. And then this man, to put it bluntly, feels betrayed. - Thats how it is - And if at the same time... the woman needs help? Then she and he can seek help... outside the home and try to find peace somewhere else. I think if you love someone it is not because we want them to help you, but quite other reasons! You love him, because you love him. When love disappears, do not look for reasons in that you did not find help. If someone starts considering who helps whom... Have you found any help outside your own home? Who is this Nikolai? You may not answer, if you do not want to. A guy who is looking for me on the phone. That is who Nikolai is. - Why are you looking at me? - Because you're nice. - Sorry? - You're nice. Does it annoy you? Goodbye! And if you turned on the stove, do not forget to turn it off. - Wait! We're going in the same direction! - I didn't know. - Goodbye! - You will not enter? - Heaven forbid! - Too bad! - Have you seen the manager? - No. - What happened? - What is it? The phone rang. Did not you hear? If they need me, they will call again. The phone rang! And please, do not send me more of these frozen chicken! Yes, we got the rest! Yes! 100 kg of potatoes, 20... I... because of the phone... What's going on here? What is this madness? - Can I come in? - The door! - And the other one. - OK. - What are you doing? - Thanks, I'm fine. - No, I... - I need to finish something. - How much do you have left? - Almost finished. - Okay, I 'll wait. - Hm? It will be quite soon. I will wait. Just finish it. I beg you. Done. Finished. Is the car behind the holiday home yours? Yes. What happened? I have a very important job in Sofia. You should have told immediately. I thought, who knows what happened. I will explain on the way. Come on! Thank you. Tonight will you be coming back? If you wait for me at 6:30 on Orlov bridge, we can get back together. I'll wait! - Maria?! - Good afternoon, Dr. Ivanov. - Hey, what brings you here? - Well, Just a small matter. Here's the card, second floor, last door. - First you fill the card. - Galya! Moment! Ah! You're here at last? - They've sent you here? - No, I'm just passing by. I do not know the assignment yet. I wanted to ask what happened to that boy from room 32, Nikolai. He was discharged ten days ago. - Why? - I have something to tell him. - Do you have his address? - Yes, wait. We'll find it in his card. - Hello! Galya! It's for you! - Wait! Yes! Yes! At 5:00. Okay, I 'll go get it. - Good day. - Good day. - Is Nikolai here? - Who? Brother? - Nikolai. - Come in. Please. - Can I offer you something? - What? No, I just need to see Nikolai. Are you Rumiana? Not Rumiana, I'm Maria. So you're a friend of Rumiana? Well, we have seen several times, but I'm not her friend. Brother Nikolay is not home. - But he will be back? - He will, but not soon. - Why did not you tell me? - Well, just like that. Shame! Wait, wait! Are you a nurse? - No, I'm a flight attendant. - Stewardess? Wait, I'll call brother Nikolai. Hello? Maria. From you. A little girl helped me. Almost. I know, that's why I'm here. I have to go to one place. To my aunt's. Can you come there? Liberation Street 28, apartment 44. Good day. Welcome. - What's this? - A lamp. Decorative. Like it? A lot. May I... A flower! Maria, I've married. What? Nothing. This is good. It is wonderful. You have made something big. So, what happened? Tell me! Well, you were right. I really love her. Suddenly everything lost sense. - I... - Yes. I'll put in the flowers. Go on! Tell me! Immediately I started looking for her, but she has moved to a friend. Her parents have learnt and made a big fuss. I was searching from morning till night. Nothing. For two nights I didn't come back to the hospital. I was like crazy! I'm listening to you. When I found her, I told her everything. She cried a lot. It has accumulated over these months living in uncertainty. The next day I was looking for you. I called the holiday home. I was told that you're not there. And 3 days ago we got married. I really wanted you to be with us. Sorry. When they told me that Nicolai was looking for me, I knew something's happened. Yet, to say honestly... I did not think that it would go so well for you. Should I play some record? Why did you want me to be with you at the wedding? A record! So why should I be with you? I always wished us to be friends. Can not we? I need to leave immediately. In the evening I need to see off my friend, he is flying to... Yes, yes! No, no! You misunderstood me! You can stay as long as you want. Only I must go. There's a flight to... - Where do you live with her? - Why? Stop wandering in the streets and cafes. Call her on the phone and tell to come here. It's cold now. Do not forget that you were sick. - Do you agree or not? - About what? To live here. Do not look at me like that. My aunt Irina used to live here. She went abroad and will not be back... soon. Will be glad when she gets to know what I did. Here's the key. Oh, it's very late! He's not used to wait for me! I don't want to hurt him just before his flight. Everything is in place. Everything is at your disposal. When you play music just be careful if it is too loud the guys above get angry. Goodbye.
