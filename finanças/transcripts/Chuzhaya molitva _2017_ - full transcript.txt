IDAS FILM UKRAINIAN STATE FILM AGENCY 87 CHILDREN Based on actual events. Dedicated to mothers... Jerusalem. Hospital. Saide! Bagcasaray, Crimea. 1942. All of these houses have to be searched. And don't forget the basements. You go to this house and to the shed behind the corner, a kid run fhat way. Hans, take two men, we're going to the rabbi. Father... - Where have you been? - The Germans are there. -I know. - What shall we do? Will we be able to flee? It's too late... Hide the children. How would they survive alone? We have no other choice. They kill the Jews. We have to save the children. They have to survive, at least them. - If she cries, they'll find everyone. - No little Sarah wouldn't cry. She knows she can't cry. She behaves. The birth certificates... Quickly, give me.the certificates of birth! Sarah, it's just like a hide and seek game. But you should just never call for me, all right? - Sit really quietly. I will find you myself. - Go on... I love you very much. Listen, now you're the oldest one. Once it gets dark, take everyone to the mountains. You have to live, you hear me? At any cost. You have to survive! Here... Hide this, don't show it to anyone. If it will get dangerous, lose them. Now go... And never, you hear me? Never forger whose son you are! - I promise. - Go on. Open up Why don't you open? Who is there inside with you? - Open the door! - What shall we do? He didn't want to go... Open up Well.. Step aside! Don't move. After all, we met you Mr Rabbi. Are you familiar with the decree concerning the Jews? You have such an exquisite company here. A real full-blown harem. I gather you were discussing something important? Perhaps, you were talking about fleeing this place? As you can see, my guess is correct! And this is interesting as well. For some unknown reason the Jews are disappearing from their houses, vanishing into thin air. A miracle! By any chance, maybe you know where they are? Search the place! It's so hot in here! And this nasty stench! How can you bear it? I've got here the list of residents. We can compare it and find all the Jews. But it takes time which, unfortunately, I don't have. I don't want to spend my precious time on the Jews! I want to be done with it. Where the Jews are hiding? Addresses? You don't want to Herr Sturmbannfuhrer! Only three were hiding in the shed. Take them out. Rabbi, I'm going to offer you a good deal. You have three minutes to think it over. You give me the information, I'll give you life. Wait here. I'll be back soon. Take your old man. Everyone, to the wall! You're doing poorly, there's not enough people. Look at the list, it's not even a third of them. I don't understand what's going on. I just stepped out to the market and now all of this... Hans, do you see those two women behind? Bring them to me. What's your name? Saide. Zuria. They're not Jewish. What's the difference? Hans, these are the Tatars, local population. We have to cooperate with them. Check their papers. Check all the papers! All the Tatars are free to go. Check the papers! Release the Tatars! Prepare the papers! Show me your papers! There used to be a synagogue here. What do we care? This is very symbolical. Oh, Rabi! Come up here. You've had three minutes to think, it's been more than that. So, how many Jews are there in Bagcasaray and where do they hide? What kind of a Jew are you, if you don't use the advantage? But I'm an Aryan and I will keep my word. Blessed be God's Glory. Then I will kill you. You already have. - No! - Come over here. No! Would you sacrifice a child, huh? Well? This decision is on you. The old Arab doesn't feel good, very high pressure, faster please! It's weird, but his pressure is fine. Why did you think he's an Arab? He's name is Isaac Preschler. A respected man, a professor. I'm sorry, I didn't know that. It's just, he was praying in Arabic. Watch his pressure. I... have to... tell everything.. I have to... Stop! What are you burning? What are these papers? I don't know, Herr Sturmbannfuhrer! The superintendent told us to take the papers out of the office and destroy them. Don't burn anything further! Bring all the papers to the superintendent office! Hans, wait here. And not even a single sheet, am I clear? - Yes Sir! - Carry on! - Heinrich! - Heil Hitler! Heil Hitler! Otto, not a single document is to be burned without my command! These documents do not contain any information on the Jews. My men have checked them already. These documents may contain much more important information! Soon, all the Crimea will turn into a German resort, the true Riviera for all the Arians, and the Crimean Tatars will service us. So it would be nice if you were more considerate with them. of course. And as for the Jews, it is just the question of time, technique, and will. The will, Otto! It is your main objective. Work more actively, effectively, and fast! The town should be freed of this scum as soon as possible! We're doing everything we can, but many of them obviously hide someplace. In any case, they do not return to their homes. Distribute the leaflets about the release of the Jews! - For a reward? - Yes, exactly. In big letters: A reward for the Jews! And execution for hiding. Right, very well, very well! The locals should know what to expect if they're thinking of hiding the Jews. We'll do exactly as you say, right away. By the way, the SS brigades under the command of Ludwig von Alvensleben will arrive to Bagcasaray soon. I've promised him a report on the search operations. Is the brigadefuhrer coming to control us? Why us, exactly? Don't worry. He's not interested in you. He's leading the archeological expedition. You probably know that the Crimea was de jure a German territory. Each stone over here is related to our history. Otto, you should know that the most powerful fortresses of the Crimea were built by the Goths. Gothia. Crimea-Gothia. The sheer sound of it! Yes, it's interesting. No, thank you. Well, I'll take care of the leaflets then. By the way, I don't like the building I'm living in. Find me some peaceful place, preferably in the country. As you wish. Saide, teach me to make a chaplet. Look, if a flower is small, add a stem to it, it will make it look longer. And the chaplet will be easier to make. You see how pretty it turns out? - Here, take it. - Thank you. Mustafa! I'm going to ask you... not to go to the town on your own anymore. But why? It's very dangerous. They may mistake you for a Jew and kill. I understand. Cufut Qale Cave Town. Don't be afraid, she'll find you. It is just a game of hide and seek. Just don't cry, you're a grownup. When are we going to eat? I'm going to try and find something to eat. I want to go with you. No, stay here. You know if I promise to come back, I will. Meanwhile, you'll be the leader here. He asked to call you. He says he wants to tell something very important. - Good afternoon. - Hello. - My name is Noah Halter, - I'm Isaac Preschler. I'm a member of the public board at the Jerusalem Yad Vashem Museum. It memorializes the righteous among the nations. Thank you for coming. I had to come. It's my duty. The name of our Saide has to be among the righteous gentiles. - Saide? - Arifova. Wouldn't it be better to stay in the downtown? It stinks here. Well, I really like it here. - Children! - Children! Children, come inside... Hello! And who are you? You again? Are these your kids? - Yes. - All of them yours? Yes, all are mine. Excuse us, it's time for them to have a lunch. - Of course. - Let's go. A mother with many children. She's beautiful. Hans, how is my furniture doing? I'd like to move in today. Don't waste any time! Go on, quickly! You can't fall asleep? I saw my mother in a dream. She was hugging me. She's so beautiful. I haven't seen mother in a dream for a long time now. For some reason I don't dream about her often, too. And my father... I didn't dream of him even once. Sometimes I think... What if he's still alive? What if the notice was sent by a mistake? You always have to believe in the best possible outcome. Now sleep. I'll prepare everything. But I don't know why we chose such a hick town to stay in. Hans, enough of moaning. Look how peaceful and calm it is. How long would we stay here, Herr Sturmbannfiihrer? Until we are finished with our job. But the job is done. We've caught almost all of the Jews already. First of all, not all of them, and secondly, I have another, more important task. May I ask what it is? You will see for yourself. Who are you? I'm Isaac. Take it and leave. And never come back. Herr Sturmbannfuhrer! An old man came to see you. What do you need? The superintendent commanded to bring the groceries every three days. It's very good. But... at whose expense? I mean, who gives the money? You only help the great German nation to get the money? I also need a woman to cook breakfasts. Find me someone. Saide. The girl who lives here. Hans, bring that Tatar girl to me. Which one? The pretty one. Who is she, a teacher? In the orphanage. She brings up the children. I see, a teacher. Yes Herr officer wants you to cook breakfasts for him. You should agree. You know very well that I'm left alone in the whole orphanage. I have only few children. And here you'll have a simple job and some payment. Think about it. I couldn't do it. I've seen him killing a child. It doesn't matter now. What she says? - She's agreed. - Splendid. Money for the groceries... Hans, pay him. Here. It's for you. Eat it. I've had my share. Otto, we'iie splitting. You and your men search the town, - and I'm going to Cufut Qale. - Chuko... what? In Crimean Tatar language it means The Jewish Fortress. Do you really think the Jews are hiding im the place named after them? Otto, I hope you'll handle the task and will report back tomorrow. Yes, Herr Sturmbannfuhrer! This is for you. Take it. And this is for you. Who are those begging kids? The level of material security? Bad, very bad. And there's more beggars now. It would be much easier to just shoot them. Why shooting right away? There is this... orphanage. Take them there. - It's been closed down for a while now. - Otto, are you the Bagcasaray superintendent - or you're just resting here? - You're right. I am the superintendent. Tomorrow I'll organize the Bagcasaray orphanage for you. Very well, please do so. By the way, it's not completely closed down, there's still a teacher and fifteen kids. - How many? - Fifteen. More of less. I didn't count them. - Do you need an address? - No, no, no. I'll take care of everything. Splendid. Hans, here's a job for you. Take those two children to our Saide. Tell her the magical Russian word, "An order". Repeat. - An order. - An order. - Wry well. - Alright. Move it, why ar-e you standing there? Let's go! I didn't want to tell it in front of everybody... I've seen the leaflets in the town... About what? They offer money reward for bringing in a Jew. Isn't it very bad? It is. We have to sit tight. It is dangerous to go down there. But what we should do? Where do we get food? Sarah has been asking for milk. Anyways, we should go back home. Don't worry. It's going to be fine. Quiet! Quiet! Get down! Wake up! The Germans are coming! Quickly, get up! Come on, faster! Quickly, quickly! Sarah, we don't have much time. Quickly, move it! This is the place. I knew it. This is the land of our forefathers. Right here they've started the powerful Theodora Principality. All the lands that belonged to ancient Germans are to be returned to the Arians. This is our land, the fortress of our power. Follow me! They wouldn't go very far with children. Keep going Faster, faster! - An order! - Hey, catch up! An order! He could've bring some food instead! "An order," he says... Now it's your turn! I have no food for my children! This is the Obersturmbannfuhrer's order. An order! Fine! - So, what's your name? - Prokhor. - And yours? - Ahtem. Let's go inside. Let's go. Why did you stop? Keep on moving! Incredible. How did you as children managed to break out from this trap? We simply had to survive. We had to survive at any cost. I've promised to my dad we'll stay alive. Even today I think... That we were saved thanks to my father's prayer that day. I told you not to come! - We have to go. - I can't go, my foot hurts. I know it hurts, but... We really have to go. I lost my doll. I'll find it. - But I'll do it later. - You promise? I promise. Issac! Come inside! Let's go Come on, come on. Isaac! Take this. And here's some water. Listen carefully. Sit tight, don't go outside. Don't look out the windows. I'll be back soon. Thank you. No. I said no. But why? I'm not driving the Jews anywhere. Neither during the day nor at night. - But they are just kids. - So what? What do you mean, "So what"? You realize they will kill them. Please, let's hide them in your wagon. Let's move them out of the town to my aunt in Simferopol. - No one will find out anything. - You lost your mind! They check everyone at each checkpoint! If the Germans find out the Tatars hide the Jews, they'll kill everyone. I know. But please. We have to help them. Think of you brother, of yourself. Think of me! I have grandchildren. If anything happens to me, who will take care of them? - So what shall I do with these kids? - I don't know. Saide! Try to understand me. You may stay for the night. Leave in the morning. Where should we go? I don't know. But you let us in. If you stay, they're going to kill us all. Let the youngest ones stay, at least. Please. Sarah, wake up. I'll walk you to bed. Let me help you. Don't wake her up. carry her. Mommy, I lost your doll. What does it say - I'll tell you later. Saide! - Hello Nazire. - Hello. How are you doing? Oh, you've grown up so much! I'm worrying. They search for the Jews all over the town! e've prepared somethingfQr y_our kids. - Thank you, Nazire. - Here you go. They've started to bring in the street kids to me. Oh it must be hard on you. I can't even imagine how to feed all of them. How do you manage?.. Well, that's Thank you. Oh, Mustafa, we have to go that way. Fresh bread! One loaf of bread. I have a lot of children. It wouldn't be enough. At least two. No, no, no. It doesn't cost that much. One loaf. No more. - Mustafa, I have to talk to you. - About what? I sheltered homeless kids for a night, they want to live with us. So? Will you accept them? I don't know what should I do with them. I'm pretty scared for all of us. Why should we be scared? These kids.. - They're Jewish. - Jewish? Fine... Watch them so they wouldn't go out. - Give it back! It's mine! - Quiet, don't shout. I'll hide this. Trust me. I have to. I don't like this. She can turn us in. And she took the birth certificates away... A German lives there. She went to see him. e have to run! Wake up! Wake up! Y®u look a bit exhausted. But I understand, you're alone with all the kids. It's fine. I'm coping. How long do you work as a teacher? Two years. And who are those kids? All kinds. Orphans mostly. Any Jews? No. Don't worry. I only want you to know: if you were to meet some Jews or find out about someone hiding them, report to me immediately. I will pay you. Where are you from, anyways? Do you have a family? No, I'm alone now. Completely alone? My aunt lives in Simferopol. Is there a fight? I think it's my kids. May I leave? Mustafa! Leave him alone! What is wrong with you? Get up! Who is the winner? Wow, so many vhildren! Wasn't it your order to bring all the homeless kids to me? Right, of course. It was my order. And so they bring them to me. Kids, go inside! Well, if you need my help, I'll be happy to. You're both shameless! - Mustafa, why? - He wanted to run away! Go inside! Saide wasn't afraid to take us in. But wasn't it... too big of a risk? Right in front of the German. She was afraid. But she noticed the Germans can't tell a Jew from a Tatar. The first thing she did, she gave us new, Tatar names. And now we will play the name game. - Mariem. - Meriem. - Sophia. - Sophia - Gulnar. - Gulnar. - Elda - Elda - Aider. - Aider. Hit harder! Come on, pass! - Come on! Here! - Here! - Take it from him! - Pass! Hello athletes! Alright, children come here! Girls! Quickly! Come to me. I see you have a football team. Will you take me in? Watch me! Yes, you hit hard. I was the best football player in my school. What do you say, shall we play? Stop there! Hey rabbi, you will be a goalkeeper. Coordination, strong hit, and speed are the most important things in football. Watch me. Good job, rabbi! He get the ball. Is my Mom there? No, your Mom isn't there. She will come soon. And now the upper corner. Rabbi could've been a good goalkeeper. Don't look! If Sarah recognizes you, they'll kill her! ...And then you'll get a result. I will show you. Put the ball right here. Football used to be my passion, but I had to practice piano at home, playing gamut everyday. You! Come over here! Come on, show us what you're capable of. Don't be afraid. Not really impressive. Come here, boy. I see you don't want to play with me for some reason. I think you're not just a regular boy. Herr Sturmbannfuhrer, we have to go. - What happened? - They're waiting for the Jews. Splendid! And you're expected in the headquarters, a call from Berlin. I see, thank you. Keep on practicing. I'll come back later, we'll play some more. Maybe my Mom wouldn't come to me because I lost the doll? No, no. My Mom was crying. But Jake was not with them for some reason. What do you think happened to him? Why wasn't he there? - Where do you think you're going? - Out of my way! Calm down! They will kill all of us because of you! Oh God.. Mustafa, take her. Lock everyone inside. Why do they hate us? What for? I've decided to never tell anyone that our parents were killed. I understand. I guess, after the parents were gone you all got very attached to Saide? I did love her very much. She did everything to save us. But... To only give the Tatar names... - It wouldn't be enough. - You don't even imagine... what she did to make the real Tatar kids out of us. I'd like to hear that. Now I'm going to teach you some very important words. And you have to memorize them perfectly. When you will feel difficult, scared, when you will need an advice, and I wouldn't be around, when you will be completely alone, just say the following out loud... I'm holding ten matches, now you will repeat ten times the words after me, once I put down the tenth match, you'll memorize these words for the rest of your lives. These words will help you. Be sure of that. Look! - But my doll had different eyes. - What kind, Elzara? Like these. Like this? Mustafa! Bring some water! - Name? - Whose name? - Your name! - Aider. - Who are your parents? - Rustem and Gulnar Kamurdzhi. - Where are you from? - From Simferopol. And now the tenth match. Now I'm not worrying about you, my dear children. You must survive. The war will end. You will be studying, working, you will have your own children, but you shall never forget your parents. Never forget yourselves. May the Lord protect you. Five, six, seven, eight... One, two, three, four... Five, six, seven, eight... You were smiling. A smile suits you. Thank you. -1 have to go. - Wait. When in the morning I'm waiting for my breakfast, to be honest, I'm just waiting to see you. My God, you're so beautiful. Saide, I like you. The smell of lavender. It's a pity you're scared of me so much. Fine, go. Every day the life has gotten worse. It was increasingly difficult to get anything. Food, clothing, shoes... And no one helped Saide? On the contrary. We've all been trying to the best of our abilities... to help her. No more milk? Why don't you eat? I've eaten already. - What do you want? - What should we do? Tomorrow we wouldn't have anything to eat at all. I don't know. You're going to the market, what if we ask someone there? No one has anything to eat these days. Look, we've got here a Yid! How do you like stealing now? Look, he bites me! You're a bastard Yid! Stop there! I'm going to kill you! Is this one a Yid? - So where is he? Where is he? - I don't know! Nowhere! Isn't he from the orphanage? No, what's wrong with you? If he was from the orphanage, I'd recognize him. - I saw him for the first time. - Right. This one is definitely form the orphanage. I often see him around. Come with me. You'll take a better look. Call Fritz. Let's go. Where are they? Where did they go? Saide! I'm looking for you here! Where have you been? - Where is Mustafa? - It's my fault. I'm sorry, we wanted to help. Hey you! One of yours? Yes. What's going on? You'll find out now. Gather up your bastards. I don't know! Honestly! They all look alike! Look carefully. That kid is not here. -Are you playing dumb? - No... Are all of your kids here? Yes Anyone went out? No one went out. I see Do you have any Jews? I don't. It must be a mistake. Take them to the commandant, let them deal with it. As for this one, I'll deal with him right now. What took you so long? You will help us in the checkup. They said you can be trusted. - Who are we checking? - These ones. So? Let's make some coin on the Jews. Look carefully, who are the Tatars and who are the Jews? The Jews? I can't tell from one glance. I'll help you. Take off your pants, kids. It's not right. The girls are here. Take off your pants. Right now! It hurts. It hurts you always lied to me. Wow, what a catch. The Tatars get circumcised just like the Jews. I know that, too. Step aside. Get dressed. Bring in the girls. So? Should we talk differently? Come over here. Confess, bastard. - Are you a Jew? - I'm a Tatar. Now I'm going to hit each one of you, one by one. I repeat: who of your bastards is a Jew? Like I said, I don't have any Jews. You're hurting me. Children's papers. Where are the papers? The principal took them. They've all been evacuated. Our car was hit. We wouldn't have time to escape. - What's his name? - Aider. - What is the name of your father? - Rustem. - Mother's name? - Gulnar. - Where did you use to live? - In Simferopol.

There was a small misunderstanding. You didn't lie to me, after all. - Let her out. - Yes Sir. - How long were they interrogating you like that? - All day long. But we were answering to all their questions. Die Polizei got nothing form us. Made the bed over here. Water the broom to make it less dusty. - Do you need a hand? -1 can handle it myself. Saide! - Saide! - Let me help. - Saide! - Help! Thank you. Call us if you need anything. We'll be here. Don't you worry. I'm better now. Everything is going to fe fine. Go to the kids. Mommy, here, take my doll. You wouldn't be scared with her. Elzara! Where are you? Now go, my darling. -1 love you. - Get well. Herr Sturmbannfuhrer! The wine is on the table, the girls are waiting. Come in already! I'll be right up! Let's go to the table. I wasn't expecting this from you, Heinrich! That you will be the first to decide to leave the blessed Crimea. -1 wasn't expecting it indeed. - Otto, I'm just following an order. They want to see me in Berlin. There are the rumors, you tried really hard, you asked all your friends to get this 'unexpected' transfer order. A goodbye drink? But what will happen to Gothia without you? The Great Crimean Gothia?! Then I had a dream about this enormous ship! That's great! You know, when I was little, me and my parents took a steamboat in Yalta. - We'll take a steamboat with you, too. - Will we take Mommy with us? Of course we will. Keep going. Jerusalem. The Yad Vashem Memorial. But the war was still going on? I'll have to say, even though you wouldn't believe it's possible, but trust me, we all thought we were one family. And why is that? Thanks to Saide. Everyone was suffering and crying around us, but we were living as if on an island full of love, happiness, and laughter. This is how we lived for two years. -And what happened next? - Next, the Soviet Army liberated Crimea. May 17, 1944. Keep on going. Mustafa, get this to the porch. Right. Bring the tables. Alright. The chairs this way. - Good afternoon. - Hello. What is it do you have here? A Tatar kindergarten? Well, basically. Do you want us to take a picture of you? Yes please. Attention, kids! I'm taking a picture! Like this... - Take a look. Nice, right? - Yeah. Let's synchronize our watches. It's 1550. - We'll start the operation at 4 a.m. - Yes comrade. - Tell your captain to prepare the men. - Yes comrade. - Proceed. - Yes comrade. May 18. Open up Open up immediately! Open the door! - Who's there? - NKVD. - Who's in charge? - What's going on? - I'm asking who's in charge? - Well, I am. I'm a teacher. Teacher, you have 15 minutes to pack your things. Wake up the children. Take food for two days, and some clothings. Wake up! - Why are you standing? Proceed. - But what is going on? You will find out later. Come on, get up! I want to sleep... You will go in whatever you're wearing. - Alright, get up! - What happened? Wake up! Come on. Wake up... Elzara, get up. What happened? - Did you round up all the damn Tatars? - Yes comrade. - Load them up. - But what is happening? According to the order, all the Tatars are proclaimed the traitors of the nation, and are to be forcefully deported. - What? - I repeat... For the collaboration with the Nazi German occupants, all the Tatars are proclaimed the traitors of the nation, and are to be forcefully deported. I don't understand. What collaboration? They are just kids. Not all of them are Tatars, some are Jewish. - Here... Here are their papers. - Why are you sticking this in my face? How you dare! Bitch! Who is Jewish? I'm asking, who is Jewish among them? Isaac. Sarah. Hannah. Innes. Luke. Nathan. It's six. Whose seventh? A boy Jake, the Germans killed him. Take her and the rest of the children to the truck. Take the Jews to commandant's office. We'll clear up the things down there. Saide. Mama. They're taking Mama away. e were devastated. We started to run after the car and shout, "We are the Tatars! We are the Tatars!" "She's our mother! Take us, too!" I've read the prayer that my father taught me, we was a rabbi from Bagcasaray. Inside of the crack between the stones I put the note wjth my supplications to God and to people. Oh God, I've prayed to you for thousands of times. In different words and in different languages in different countries. And you were saving me. Always, everywhere, from all the troubles. I was surprised, thankful, and happy. I was praising Thou. When I reached my arms to Thou, I was hoping Thou wouldn't refuse to help me. But now I understand, Thine hand is always there to help people. And the rest depends only on us. On May 18, 1944 the Crimean Tatars were deported from Crime to the Middle East. In 1993 Saide Arifova was able to move back to Crimea, until her death she was trying to find at least some of the children she saved...
