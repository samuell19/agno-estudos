- WOMAN: I just... - Hi, kids. All right? - Get the recording going. -(WOMAN LAUGHING) JON PERTWEE: I had a great belief that it was much more frightening fo stay on Earth, that all the threats should come to Earth, rather than us going off into other planets. There's nothing more alarming than coming home and finding a yeti sitting on your loo in Tooting Bec. TOYAH WILLCOX: I can remember I used to watch it sitting on my mother's lap, when I was terribly young. (MIMICKING GUNSHOTS) And the majority of the time my head was buried in my mother's breast or in a pillow. But I really enjoyed the tantalising fear and I really believed what I was watching. (SCREAMS) TOM BAKER: Doctor Who is watched at several levels in an average household. Excuse me? Excuse me? TOM BAKER: The smallest child terrified behind the sofa or under a cushion and the next one up laughing at him and the elder one saying, "Shh, I want to listen. " And the parents saying, “Isn't this enjoyable?” COLIN BAKER: It's endeared itself to generations of people in this country, because even though the Doctor comes from a placed called Gallifrey and is a Time Lord, there is an essentially British quality to the programme. I think that's probably why it's popular overseas. SYLVESTER McCOY: It is part of our television culture, Doctor Who, and it has a great influence on young people. ' Exterminate! (DOCTOR WHO THEME) NARRATOR: It was 16 minutes past 5, Earth time, on Saturday, the 23rd of November, 1963, Just a day after the assassination of President Kennedy, when Doctor Who first materialised on BBC television. Squeezed between the football results and The Telegoons, a legend was born. Have you ever thought what it's like to be wanderers in the fourth dimension? Have you? To be exiles? Susan and I are cut off from our own planet, without friends or protection. But one day, we shall get back. Yes. One day... He was a mystery, an enigma. It becomes clear later that he is not in fact a human being but they didn't know that right from the start. - I'm a Time Lord. - Oh, I know you're a Time Lord. You don't understand the implications. I'm not a human being, I walk in eternity. (LAUGHING) What's that supposed to mean? It means I've lived for something like 750 years. - You'll soon be middle aged. - Yes! He's an old-fashioned hero. He's always an extremely good, extremely moral character. He's always on the side of right and truth and justice. There are some corners of the universe which have bred the most terrible things. Things which act against everything that we believe in. They must be fought. In all my travellings throughout the universe, I have battled against evil. Against power-mad conspirators. I should have stayed here, the oldest civilisation, decadent, degenerate and rotten to the core. Power-mad conspirators? Daleks, Sontarans, Cybermen! They're still in the nursery compared to us. Ten million years of absolute power, that's what it takes to be really corrupt. DICKS: He's never cruel, he's never unkind. He's always trying to make peace, he always protects the underdog. Do you run all your factories like that, Controller? That was not a factory, Doctor. - Then what was it? - A rehabilitation centre. A rehabilitation centre for hardened criminals. Including old men and women? Even children? I'm not sure he always won but I mean, what separated him from the evil that he encountered, uh, was his... And this is paradoxical, but it was his human qualities. But I think basically he acted out of a moral impulse. You know, that was his defining trait. I'm gratified that you appreciate it. Appreciate it? Appreciate it! But you commit mass destruction and murder on a scale that's almost inconceivable and you ask me to appreciate it? Just because you happen to have made a brilliantly conceived toy out of the mummified remains of planets! Devilstorms, Doctor! It is not a toy! Then what's it for? Huh? What are you doing? What could possibly be worth all this? COLIN BAKER: I suppose what sums up the Doctor, really, is an essential belief in the rightness of things. And if things aren't right, then he feels compelled to do something about it. And right doesn't always necessarily mean beautiful or happy or pretty, but right. It's got to be right. They dare to tamper -with the forces of creation? - Yes. They dare. And we have got to dare to stop them. I saw the character of Doctor Who as an anti-establishment character and I really do feel initially that's one of the reasons why people were drawn towards... Kids particularly, because they felt that here was an adult, you know, who was as against the establishment as they were. And they sort of bonded with him in a strange way, even though they were sort of scared of him at the same time. Hey. Hey, what's that for? Oh, well you see, the problem is coming back to the 20th century, my dear, the Tardis, I'm afraid, is often mistaken for the real Police Box. I see what you mean. Yes, and fortunately, he can't get in. (NARRATOR READING) Two hearts beat inside the Doctor's unearthly body. The Doctor once claimed that an aspirin might kill him. The Doctor can only regenerate 12 times. Then, it really is the end. LAMBERT: William Hartnell, who was the first Doctor Who, I think absolutely fell in love with the character because Doctor Who, as I envisaged, was a rather cantankerous, difficult, unpredictable character, who also had a bit of the child in him there as well I was only little when the programme started but it seemed quite natural to me that my grandfather should be on television with a long, white wig, playing the character. But of course it meant that I could watch it without getting scared. So I didn't watch from behind the sofa. I knew that it was going to be all right and that my grandfather would win in the end. I know that he did a lot of personal appearances as Doctor Who. I think he really enjoyed doing that because he really appreciated all the fans and the fact that so many kids thought it was such a exciting programme. With two young grandchildren, he'd suddenly become aware of children again in way that he probably hadn't been for years. He believed in the programme and loved getting through to the kids and I think he... It was important to him that it wasn't too violent and too frightening. But he also knew that kids loved the excitement of it as well Well, he was quite bossy in some ways, Bill. Yes, he was. He had very definite ideas about how one should behave, especially a young girl. The trouble is I think that he rather confused the fact that I was playing a 15-year-old. And he treated me like a 15-year-old. He took the part a little bit beyond the bounds of duty. I've been finding out a lot about my grandfather lately because I'm in the middle of writing a biography of him. So it's been really interesting for me to look over his past and see how many films he did and what actually led up to him being cast as Doctor Who. Because I think it's quite curious that someone who was well-known for playing angry army sergeants and tough criminals should have become so well-known and so loved by children. Come along, my dear, it's time we were off. (WHOOSHING) LETTS: One of the reasons why Doctor Who has managed to survive for so long, is precisely because of this bright idea they had when William Hartnell wanted to leave the show after three years, that he could regenerate into a different-looking person. And he did indeed regenerate into Patrick Troughton. POLLY: Ben, do you remember what he said in the tracking room? Something about "This old body of mine is wearing a bit thin." BEN: So he gets himself a new one? POLLY: well, yes. I was really miffed. I didn't like it at all. I didn't understand it. It was heartbreaking to see this familiar face go and to accept... Well, it was rather kind of... romantically put that he was regenerating into another Doctor Who. I mean, in my eyes, he was dying, and I'd never see him again. And it was just hard to accept but I think I had forgotten about him within... Four episodes into the new Doctor Who, I'd forgotten who William Hartnell was. Shows how fickle we are, doesn't it? Oh, so you're my replacements? A dandy and a clown. - Have you done anything? - Well, we've assessed the situation... Just as I thought Nothing. Billy had made him this crotchety old gentleman. He was very serious and I had to be very serious, too. But the way I made it serious was by... Well, by making him a bit of a clown to start with. Sort of offbeat thing, you see. Ah, Doctor, at last! (SCREAMING) - Right! - Let go of me! We started rather wild and we mellowed as the time went on, you see. Now, then, where shall we go? Ah, let's just get our breath back first before you start tearing off anywhere. Anyway, as you know, the Tardis has a mind of its own. You know you can't control it. - Can't control it? - No. We'll see about that. We'll see about that! - Here we go again. - Wonder where it'll be this time? Yes, I wonder. I remember the first day of rehearsals, I walked into the rehearsal room and I was actually terrified. Very scared, very young, very shy. And Pat was marvellous, he made me feel at home immediately. What about me? - Did I as well? - Well sort of, yes. Well, yes you did, actually, I must be nice to you. - I was lusting after you at the time. - No, you weren't, Frazer. Stop it! Anyway, Pat... had a lovely sense of humour as well, With the twinkling eyes. Very naughty eyes, Pat always had. But he became really to me like a... -second father. - Hmm. - And a best friend, really. - And a brilliant actor as well. - Super. - A believable Doctor. Yes, yes. Now, come along. Oh, no. No, don't let's go into the tunnel, please! But we've got to get above ground, Victoria. Now, let's try the next station. - Come on... - No, Jamie, no! Don't move! Don't touch the rail! whatever you do, stand still! - What's the matter? - Stand still. Don't move. Keep quite still, Jamie. Oh! It's all right. You can relax. The electricity is off. It's very hard to describe Troughton. Whereas Jon was much more Holmesian, wasn't he? Very grand and... He's so shockingly recognisable, isn't he? He's rather like a tall light bulb, isn't he? Glitters. (CHUCKLES) There are very few men who can get away with a velvet jacket and a frill-fronted shirt. I can think of Jimi Hendrix and Jon Pertwee and they are the only ones. Do you mean me? TURNER: Doctor Who started as a very Edwardian gent. Very genteel, slightly dandy but not too wild. And as you look at what happens over time, there's always this Edwardian feel that runs right the way through. He might have assistants who verge on the sort of youth element at times, but he is always the gentleman. Clothes, obviously, are very important to Doctor Who. Don't quite know where he gets them from. Somewhere, somewhere in space. Jon Pertwee was, without doubt, my favourite of all the Doctors, because I just think he's so damn sexy, I mean, I certainly would have followed him into that Tardis anywhere. Even if we got fo the wrong place, I wouldn't have minded. Come on. We'll just take a quick look around. Then I'll try and get you back to Earth, all right? ERIC SAWARD: Pertwee reflected the popularity of James Bond. Drawing on what was happening at the time, he was very much James Bond, the way he dressed. MAN: Action! SAWARD: It was very much more into hardware, cars... Whomobiles. Hello, old girl. He's turned off to the right, Brigadier. It's got a Hillman Imp engine at the back, which is a real popped-up engine. And the front end is a Bond with a little tiny wheel about this big. And I'm sitting in a sort of two-inch steel box because I thought we'd need a bit of safety. And it certainly is the most extraordinary car I've ever seen. Jon, it looks rather like a hovercraft. - Is it allowed to go on the road? - Yes it is. It's a one-off. - There's nothing like it in the world. - I'm sure. And it isn't a hovercraft. It's a proper car that is -taxed and insured. - How does it run? It looks as though it's on a cushion of air. - It's in fact on three wheels. - One at the front and two at the rear. - Mind the jets at the rear. - Right. - Don't frighten the dog. - Here we go. Bye, Jon. (CRAFT WHIRRING) Doctor, we're flying! Yes, of course we're flying. All the Doctors had their own particular eccentricities. Would you like a Jelly Baby? They're rather good. Go on, have one. There were the Jelly Babies, which I think ran through several Doctors, as did the sonic screwdriver. (CREATURE SHOUTING) (WHIRRING) Even the sonic screwdriver won't get me out of this one. Drop the sonic device. (SIGHS) Isn't my day, is it? I feel as though you've just killed an old friend. JAMIE: What's that? DOCTOR: It's a sonic screwdriver. NARRATOR: The Doctor's trusty sonic screwdriver first appeared in an episode which, sadly, no longer exists on film. DOCTOR: All done by soundwaves. It's such a sad thing that the BBC, you know, hasn't got in its archives Doctor Who from... -day one. - Day one. It was a long time ago, I know, and it was in black and white but no, that's the period. My era they called the monster era, do you think? HINES: Hmm, yeah. WATLING: And it's looked on as a classic. IAN LEVINE: There had been a consistent five-year run of Doctor Who episodes being junked. From '72 to '78 all the BBC Enterprises had destroyed all the negatives, without checking that they existed anywhere else. 'X came in in 1378 to BBC Enterprises, ' went into a vault and found the very first Dalek story all taped up and marked for destruction. And the guy that let us into the vault said it was due to be taken out and burnt that day. So if I had been a day later, we would have lost the very first Dalek story forever. DALEK: Fire! (GROANING) NARRATOR: There are currently 110 episodes of Doctor Who still missing. DALEK: Stop! NARRATOR: Fortunately, we can still enjoy this. The very first appearance of the creatures who secured the programme's early success. DALEK: Your legs are paralysed. You will recover shortly unless you force us to use our weapons again. In that case the condition will be permanent. They were such an immediate success that, in a way, they put the whole of Doctor Who on the map and made it a programme which everyone knew about. Surely you don't expect all the people to welcome you with open arms? DALEK: We have already conquered Earth. Conquered the Earth? You poor pathetic creatures, don't you realise? Before you attempt to conquer the Earth, you will have to destroy all living matter. DALEK: Take them. Take them. DALEK: We are the masters of Earth. We are the masters of Earth. We are the masters of Earth. Humanoid female observed in river area. Pursue and detain! Pursue! Pursue! Pursue! Pursue! Stand by. Order Dalek Hoverbout to Sector 4. I obey. Today when I saw those Daleks, I remembered the first time when we went out to shoot that. And it was a Sunday morning because that's the only time you could shoot like this. And very early, and there were these creatures coming across the bridge. And even though I knew that it was unreal, I almost felt it could be real There's something about them that made people suspend their disbelief. A man called Sydney Newman, who was a Canadian, who was then Head of BBC Drama, and who had thought of the basics of Doctor Who, he was furious about the Daleks because he had told me that he didn't want any BEMs, which is short for bug-eyed monsters. And he considered the Daleks to be the epitome of BEMs. (NARRATOR READING) The word "Dalek" means "a far and distant thing" in Serbo-Croat. Dalek, is an anagram of "Kaled,” the race from which the Daleks evolved. ' When its top is removed, ' a Dalek emits an automatic distress call What are you waiting for? Just touch these two strands together and the Daleks are finished. Have I that right? To destroy the Daleks? You can't doubt it! Well, I do. You see, some things could be better with the Daleks. Many future worlds will become allies just because of their fear of the Daleks. It isn't like that... But the final responsibility is mine and mine alone. SARAH JANE: We're talking about the Daleks, the most evil creatures ever invented. You must destroy them! You must complete your mission for the Time Lords. DOCTOR: Do I have the right? DALEK: On course for planet Desperus. Impact in point-six... DICKS: The appeal of the Daleks is total nastiness. There is absolutely nothing good about a Dalek. They have no redeeming qualities, they have no conversation. You know, they have no lighter side. (SCREAMING) Their one response to being frustrated in any way is to exterminate you. (GASPS) (SCREAMING) A few weeks ago, you may remember, we launched our own Doctor Who competition to mark the programme's 30th anniversary. Yes, the question we asked was "Who created the Daleks?" And the answer is writer Terry Nation. Hundreds of people wrote in. I'm going to ask Jon to pick one of these cards that's in our special Doctor Who... Excuse me, are you sure that Terry Nation invented the Daleks? Oh, don't, he'll know! DALEK: Daleks conquer and destroy! Daleks conquer... ALAN WHICKER: These are the villains of children's hour, the heavies, perambulating metal monsters with a tendency fo exterminate. They've had a comfortingly unhorrific effect upon the life and surroundings of their creator, a former comedian turned scriptwriter, Terry Nation. Those who cater for the public taste have always found the monstrous a profitable preoccupation. Well, a lot of people said Terry Nation, anyway. I think Terry wrote about it in a script. But it was in fact invented... The machine was invented by a gentleman on the staff of the BBC. Who got an ex gratia payment of 250 quid, I think. Okay, we're delighted that you came to see us today, Jon. WHICKER: Now television offers its rewards. - So this is... This is how it all began? - That's it. How did a Dalek come to be a heavy? It... Well, I needed a villain. You know, a very quick job. There was to be six episodes of Doctor Who, which was take the money and fly like a thief. I needed a villain and the Daleks appeared somehow. I couldn't tell you an interesting story. They were just the villainous creatures that came out of nowhere. Oh, there was going to be Dalek films, they were going to make Dalek soap and Dalek tea towels. You know, everyone had visions of lots of money. Um, I... Was quite friendly then with Terry Nation. And we appeared on a very famous show on BBC2 called Late Night Line-Up. And I remember asking him after the show, "What about the films, Terry?" And he said, "Leave it to me," you know. And I never saw him again. - The judge's decision is always final. - Absolutely. It is, and the judge's decision has been final. - Yeah, yeah. - Whether it was right or not. - Terry Nation is the answer. - Right. - We'll pick the Terry Nation winner. - Good. I suppose it's the fact that it is totally unhumanoid, that it's... It has no arms or legs, no facial distinction, so it's not something that's... that's a man dressed up. - Have another go. The answer's wrong. - (LAUGHING) And they were horrified but they never stopped looking. That was the beauty of it. The letters came from the parents, saying, "How dare you put these things on?" But the letters came from the kids saying, "Please don't stop." Doctor Who competition. Answer, "Davros". That's wrong. That's the third one that says Dav... Look, I'm beginning to panic here. If I may have your attention. The inventor of the Daleks was Terry Nation. (CHEERING) I've never been sure of the truth of this. I now say that the Daleks were very much based on the SS and the Nazis. Line up. It wasn't as if it was a concealed subplot, subtext in the story, it was right there out in the open what they were and what they symbolise. Mass exterminations followed by absolute suppression of the survivors. DALEK 1: Operate pyro-flames. DALEK 2: We obey. NARRATOR: The Daleks blazed a trail for the next 30 years, returning time and again to do battle with each of the seven Doctors. They became so familiar that the word "Dalek" even found its way into the English Dictionary. DICKS: Daleks, in fact, are not robots. Inside the Dalek is a small, squiggly, helpless creature. The Dalek is really a tank with a living being inside it, only the two have kind of grown interfused. And I think every little kid likes the idea of getting inside the Dalek and zooming around giving Mum, Dad, Teacher and anybody else who gets up their nose, you know, a quick exterminating blast. When I was about nine, I had a Dalek suit. It was wonderfully perverse, it was red PVC with kind of little knobs on. And I used to like smelling it because I loved the smell of PVC. And it had this cardboard head and this kind of knob at the end. This is the Dalek suit given to me Christmas, 1964. There was another Dalek suit as well, given to my brother, but I'm afraid that's disintegrated. My parents got very worried because they didn't know the factory had burnt down and they didn't arrive, they didn't arrive, then at 10:00 at night on Christmas Eve they arrived. It was a special delivery because after all, my grandfather was William Hartnell. Christmas morning, my brother and I opened the packages and saw these wonderful Dalek suits. We put them on. I was a little bit too tall and my feet showed under the bottom but my brother was completely covered. I exterminated my brother about 10 times a day. It was just bliss. CHILD: Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! I thought they were a bit silly because they weren't frightfully manoeuvrable. I mean, here they were supposed to be the greatest threat on Earth, from wherever. And you only had to go down two flights of stairs and that was that, they couldn't follow you. They had to say, "Oi, come back!" If you're supposed to be the superior race of the universe, why don't you try climbing after us? Bye-bye. I made lots of jokes about that in the past but of course, that's out now. No longer does the story mean anything, because Daleks can now go down stairs. NARRATOR: It was 25 years before the Dalek was seen to conquer the staircase on-screen. But in the famous comic strips of the mid-'60s they dominated the skies from their Transolar discs. Dalek Hoverscout reporting from Sector 4. Target observed escaping in time capsule. Order pursuit by new proto-Daleks. The trouble is, you see, they couldn't always necessarily see where they were in relation to everybody else. And you'd have the director yelling directions to them. And if he'd say, “You in the middle, move to the left, " They wouldn't necessarily know that they were in the middle. So we decided the best thing to do would be to stick Dalek 1, Dalek 2, Dalek 3, etcetera, you know, in a sufficiently prominent place so the director could say, "Right. Dalek 1, move to your left." Trying out which side camera, out to the left? Can you come forward please, John? Right, and direct to camera? LETTS: The Daleks were never popular with directors. One director said to me when I asked her if she'd like to direct a Doctor Who, she said, "Yes, as long as I don't have to direct any tin cans." MAN 1: Done, Geoff? MAN 2: Hold it. Hold the fire. Can we go on a single on Murphy? - Murphy is the right-hand one, isn't he? - This one. Yes, that one. NARRATOR: The Daleks really hit the big time with two movies in the mid-'60s. And when Susan next stepped from the Tardis, she was played by Roberta Tovey, at the tender age of 77. ANNOUNCER: Doctor Who, the brilliant science professor, the young man who triggered off this strange journey, the professor's frightened granddaughter and the youngster who inherited her grandfather's adventurous spirit A lot of people forget that there's been two movies. They seem to remember all the television Doctor Whos, which it was originally made for. But it's nice that there are quite a few fans out there that remember. ANNOUNCER: 2750 AD, a year that will thrill you and terrify you. Look! We did a scene on the back lot at Shepperton where we were driving along, bumpily along, and it was going quite fast, and one of the Dalek airships was supposed to have spotted us, so it's chasing us along. And I can remember at the time being quite terrified that I was going to get thrown out of this van any moment. ANNOUNCER: Leading the resistance fighters is Peter Cushing, his most thrill-making role. TOVEY: Peter Cushing was Doctor Who for me, and he was like a grandfather to me. (YELLS) Aided by Bernard Cribbins, a reluctant traveller into the dangerous future. Have you seen the girl? Listen, where's the girl? ANNOUNCER: Ray Brooks, the boy with the knack... who doesn't find life so easy in the year 2150 AD. Andrew Keir, fill Curzon, Roberta Tovey. It would be wonderful to do another film after all these years, that Susan has grown up, but... That would be nice, but it's still nice to know that we did the two films. And... that still stands at the moment. No one else has ever made any more films of them. Stop the countdown! The bomb will destroy the planet! DALEK: We are coming back to see you! We expect you to be here fo meet us! - Bring back memories? - It certainly does. Mmm-hmm. You have invaded the world of the Daleks. JENNIE LINDEN: The sets were amazing. I think actually, it was the first plastic set that was ever made, it was also the first colour version of Doctor Who. That's right. And big screen. So it was sold on that. ANNOUNCER: Now you can see them in colour on the big screen, closer than ever before. So close you can feel their fire. So thrilling you must be there. They were meant to shoot fire and they changed that because -it was sort of... - Too frightening... Too frightening for the kiddos. So they shot foam, didn't they? - Fire extinguishers. - Yes, that's the word - I was looking for. Fire extinguishers. - Fire extinguishers. Foam. And they were full of dancers who were specially selected because they were so agile. And I think they must have been very hot and very uncomfortable. In fact, I know they were. The Daleks was, for me, the great scene where I beat up this Dalek with a baseball bat. Under attack! Under attack! Vision impaired! Reinforcements requested! And then it was one of those wonderful Doctor Who-y like endings which I always remember from my childhood, which is... Oh, my goodness! How on earth is the assistant going to get away from this one? DALEK: Stay where you are. Do not move. Exterminate! Exterminate! DALEKS: Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! I loved those endings. These were very, very alarming indeed and it was the atmosphere that made it the success it was. Jumping Jehoshaphat! ANNOUNCER: will Doctor Who escape this time? Try Wall's new shaped Sky Ray, with double flavours of raspberry and orange. And you get a free colour picture card. One of a series showing Doctor Who and the space raiders battling with Daleks. Free! When you buy Wall's new shaped Sky Ray. Only sixpence. - Do you like it? - Do I like it? I love it! - Is it really a Prime Computer? - Do you know about them? Know about them! I have seen them on Gallifrey, in the constellation of Kasterborous. Ha-ha! - At last, I am up to date. - Would you like to be introduced? - It's terribly interactive. - Interactive? - You mean immediate response? - Immediate. Okay, Prime. How long is my scarf? - Well, it's not that impressive. - What? In seven computer languages and five protocols? - Protocols? - Yes. - That's how it talks to other computers. - It talks to other computers? Well, of course it does. It's a Prime. You're going to be all right, kid. (DOCTOR WHO THEME) (ROARING) (ROARING) Where do monsters come from is a chicken and an egg story. I mean, do they come from fairy tales? Where did the monsters in fairy tales come from? Where do the monsters in myths come from? Monsters, there've always been monsters. People have always believed in monsters. People have always told stories about monsters. I think small children liked to be frightened because it's safe. It's safe to be frightened by something on the TV. We cast that head in rubber. - It's all made of rubber, is it? - Nearly all made of rubber. Yes, this is a sort of fabric here, which is a plastic. As you can see, this is... solid rubber, and I imagine for the unfortunate artist who has to wear this for a long period, very uncomfortable indeed. INTERVIEWER: I mean, did you set out to try and make them as horrible as you possibly can? Are there no limits? I don't think so, I think the author in any of the Doctor Who stories, and as you know, there are number of authors, and they obviously create these monsters in their own minds and we try and interpret them as faithfully as possible. INTERVIEWER: After you've created some of these, or helped to create some of these monsters, do they then take on a sort of personality of their own? Do they become either more horrific than you'd intended or perhaps more amusing? WILKIE: They certainly take on a personality because particularly with the Draconian, we're looking at the mutant at the moment but there is an ugly creature. And obviously, an actor wearing that, he very much becomes a mutant. And one wouldn't stand next to him in the tea queue. INTERVIEWER: Outside, I think we can use one of your monsters again right now to hopefully walk straight through that pane of glass. Here he goes. Ooh! There's a monster called the Cybermen, who are humans who have replaced most of themselves by various metal parts. These humanoids are not like us. They still have fear. Place the Cybermats on the runway. Cybermats will attack. I have to say, I remember the Cybermen because I thought that they were particularly sexy. (LAUGHS) Because they were so masculine and there they were in these kind of fetish suits, these kind of silver suits. The earliest Cybermen, in early editions of Doctor Who, they were rather absurd creatures, it was as though someone had got dressed up out of a kitchen drawer. They were wearing sort of household bolts and bayonet sockets. And the highest expression of technological outerwear was wearing gumboots painted silver. But slowly and slowly, the Cybermen evolved into latter-day Cybermen, who are actually wearing immersion suits, like military aircraft pilots. So, curiously, the Cyberman is one strain of Doctor Who which is in touch with genuinely advanced thinking about technology. LETTS: Monsters do divide into more mechanical monsters like the Daleks and the Cybermen and the more organic ones. Like the Drashigs, which were 40-foot-high caterpillars with faces like dogs and horns as well, and made the most ghastly roaring noise. (ROARING) They haven't got a thought in their head except just fo eat anything that came near them, you see. Or you had the giant maggots. Maggots as big as this, or that size. And if they bit you or even touched you, you turned bright green and died. Good grief! Green, the colour for monsters is green for some reason or other, that seems to be a particular thing. On the whole, the organic, the living creature sort of monster predominates. The Zygons, for instance, who were very blobby and slimy and organic. Immediately, Commander. This our planet, we were here before man. The Draconians, for instance, were an example of the people monster. They were an intelligent being, an intelligent alien race, and they had morals and a culture and a way of life, rather like Japanese samurai, with codes of honour of their own and as far as they were concerned, they were the good guys. And man was getting in the way. May I have permission to address the emperor? - Wait! - This is an insult. My life at your command, sire. How dare you address the emperor in a manner reserved for a noble of Draconia? Ah, but I am a noble of Draconia. The honour was conferred on me by the 15th emperor. The 15th emperor reigned 500 years ago. Your Majesty, do not be taken in by this ridiculous story. Be silent! Why I like these particular monsters better than any other is because you can see the human eye and you can see the mouth. And therefore you get real, true expression. Unlike the Ice Warriors, in my opinion, or the Cybermen, who just have a slit, you just heard the voice. But here you can see the mouth. Will you speak to me, sir? My life at your command. There you are, you see? Perfect example. Eyes can be seen, mouth can be seen. That's why they were my favourite monsters. (NARRATOR READING) The noise of a dying Zygon is made by squelching hand cleanser. Gold to a Cyberman is like garlic to a vampire. And a yeti's roar is a flushing lavatory. Slowed down, of course. We used to sort of sit behind the, as we are now, sort of just peering round, just to see what was coming round, one of the Cybermen or the Ice Warriors or something. ' And it was really quite frightening. . What is that? Let me have it. - Give it to me at once. - Zondal. To a certain extent, we set out to frighten the viewer. It's traditional, everybody talks about how they watched, when they were little, Doctor Who over the top of the sofa or between their fingers or through the crack in the door. Well, of course I have made a lot of children's programmes. Things like Thunderbirds and Captain Scarlet, foe 90 and so forth. But the real tragedy of my life is that my son Jamie is... A Doctor Who fan. Yes, a Doctor Who fan. The biggest joy is that a year and half ago, Sadie started to notice Doctor Who, to watch it and... - You enjoyed it, didn't you? - Yeah. And our house is literally packed with Tardises of all shapes and sizes and videos and books. I mean, you name it, it's there. We're going to have to move house shortly to make more room for his Doctor Who collection. I had no idea, you see, the videos are coming out now. There's whole new audience, it's so exciting. It's really back to youngsters again, and this wonderful thing about a hero, and Doctor Who will win. They need it, they love it. LETTS: I think that the role of the monster and the frightening story is very much the role of the ogre and the giant in fairy stories. It's something to be frightened of, which is... containable because it's obviously made up. A child can accept a monster when it's quite clearly not something he's going to meet round the corner. Together with Doctor Who, we went through all those quarter of a million entries, and it takes quite a long time to look through that many. And the winner is really a very new idea, and here it is, it's a steel octopus and it's been designed by Karen Dag. NOAKES: And we sent this design to the BBC's special effects workshop and so here's a life-sized model of Karen's steel octopus. Well, the next monster to win a first prize is in the 8s-fo-70s group, and here is the design. It's a Hypnotron, and it's been invented by Paul Worrell. SINGLETON: Quite fearsome and gruesome that is. PURVES: Just keep it away from me. SINGLETON: Yes, well, in the 11s-and-over section, this is the first-prize-winning design. It's an Aguaman, and it's been created by Stephen Thompson. I don't think this one can smile but by gum, he can wink. LETTS: We actually ran into a great deal of trouble over one story where things did come fo life which were normal. There was a troll doll that when it got warm came to life and tried to strangle people. And we got a lot of flak from that because children were really scared. (SCREAMS) A friend of mine said that his little boy wouldn't take his teddy bear to bed with him, in case it came to life and strangled him. Well, I'd just got used to going onto the Underground, perhaps my first trip, when your mum says go up into the guards train and make sure you're okay. And all of a sudden, we saw the yetis in the Underground. And that really put a little bit of the mockers for a couple of weeks. We had phone calls from Scotland Yard saying please don't make policemen frightening because we had policemen who had false faces. The Doctor leant forward and peeled off the policeman's face and he had this awful blank robotic face underneath. It was a different sort of frightening, you see. It's okay to frighten with something which you are not going to meet in everyday life, but it's not otherwise. Well, it's absolutely fantastic, isn't it? I certainly wouldn't like to come round the corner of the building and just walk into one of those. 'Deane me, no. What... (BEEPING) What's that strange noise? Goodness me, it's absolutely enormous! Look at the size of it! Quite fantastic. Well, I think I'll chance... And go and have closer look to it. Now, these are the great arms that do all the smashing. Look at that for size, look at it. You can see the power in that, it can smash through anything. Now, down here must be this sort of caterpillar track. ' WAR MACHINE: Let go. . Well, that is absolutely fantastic, isn't it? Just look at the strength of it. I shouldn't think anything would stand up, would you? It'd just go, "Broom!" - Straight through it. -1 should think Doctor Who is in for quite a lot of trouble in his next adventure. He certainly is. Well, I am going to certainly look in on Saturday and see how he gets on. (SCREAMS) COLIN BAKER: Doctor Who is about playing Cowboys and Indians, only it's moved on to television. And the idea of the intergalactic traveller who takes young people with him and therefore connects to children and families is a... is a warm idea, it's one that makes people happier. Well, Doctor, can you see anything? Any sign of life? DOCTOR: No, no, no. No sign of life. Oh, let me have a look? It's fabulous! Colin, what do you think is the role of the companion? Well, apart from being to lovely to look at, you mean? You've always known the answer to that. You tell me, go on. - Well, to ask a lot of questions. - Yes, true. what else? - To make the Doctor look very clever. - Of course. What else? To let the audience know what's going on. You're getting there. What else? To reaffirm the patently obvious. - That's about the size of it. - Yes, I thought we'd agree there. You do know there's a lot of Cybermen following us? Yeah, I know that. I knew that. (NARRATOR READING) Twenty-eight companions have travelled with the Doctor. Susan was the first Ace was the last Three companions have met untimely deaths on their travels through time and space. And one companion posed with a Dalek. Both were topless. Yep. They're on their way, yeah. Here they come now. NARRATOR: Across the years, only one companion, a VIP, has appeared with each of the seven television Doctors. Brigadier Alistair Gordon Lethbridge-Stewart, as played by Nicholas Courtney. That's me, actually. My Lord Merlin. Merlin? - Oh, he has many names. - He has many faces. And he has many companions. This must be the latest one. We've checked the perimeter. Dr Warmsly is staying with the vehicles. Oh, Thank you, Bambera. Oh, see if you can get a blanket for this young lady, will you? Yes, sir. Perhaps I should make some tea, too. - Well, are you all right, Miss, erm... - Just call me the latest one. And I can get my own blanket. Oh, dear. Women not really my field. Don't worry, Brigadier. People will be shooting at you soon. My first appearance in Doctor Who was in 1965, in "The Dalek Master Plan", in which I played Bret Vyon. Desperus is the penal planet of the solar system. Well, if it's one of your prison planets, surely there are guards and wardens there to help us? There aren't any. They only craft which stop there are prison ships bringing other criminals. If we crash there, we'll be left there to rot the rest of our lives away. You must try to land softly somewhere. I can't. This vessel is out of my control. Working with Bill Hartnell was interesting, it was towards the end of his time as the Doctor. And I think he was getting a little tetchy because he wasn't a particularly well man. But he seemed to like me. But the funny thing was, he said, "You're with the wrong agent, Nick, "I'll put you with mine." And I didn't work for a year. How nice to see you again, Doctor. It's Colonel Lethbridge-Stewart. Brigadier now, I've gone up in the world. Pat Troughton was leaving and Jon Pertwee was going to be the next Doctor. And they wanted to do a dummy run to see if the idea of UNIT would work, whereby this army outfit would assist the Doctor. Well, since the Yeti do, I've been in charge of an independent intelligence group that we call UNIT. That's United Nations Intelligence Task-force. You mean you're like a world secret police? Not quite, we don't actually arrest people, we just investigate. You can call it, not Dad's Army, but Brig's Army, you have a brigadier, a captain, a sergeant. And that's it. It's rather a small group of people to be fighting alien monsters and saving the world. What are we waiting for? Let's get after him. Wait, sir. Look. Yes, I see what you mean. Never mind, we'll soon fix him. - Jenkins? - Sir. Chap with the wings there, five rounds rapid. I mean, that is the military solution to everything, isn't it? Five rounds rapid will dispose of this appalling chap. Look out! Thank you, Brigadier. But do you think for once in your life you could manage to arrive before the nick of time? I'm glad to see you too, Doctor. The Brigadier, played by Nicholas Courtney, was the most wonderful actor to work with because he was always so absolutely rock solid. You never could throw him. - That line, you mean? - WOMAN: Yes. Ah, fine. Yes, sure. No, okay. Yes, indeed. Yeah, sure. WOMAN: Studio running. Shh. Shot 43, take 3. He was always so straightlaced and so true about it, you know, he never wavered, he knew what he was doing. And it allowed Sarah to make fun of him without demeaning him. Anyway, it's nice to see you again, Brigadier. And you, Miss Smith. But I didn't expect to see you in a kilt. My dear Miss Smith, as you'll remember, my name is Lethbridge-Stewart. The clan Stewart. Oh, sorry, I thought you were doing a Doctor. BRIGADIER: What an absurd idea. SYLVESTER McCOY: Sophie! Sophie! Where is she? From a writer's point of view, the companions have a practical use in that enables you... It enables you to split the story from time to time. I mean, I always say that the classic Doctor Who story is they are travelling in the Tardis. They land and it's a horrible place. The Doctor says, "Oh, dear, “something's gone wrong. "Let's have a look round. You go that way, I'll go this way. " Scatter. DICKS: They bump into two opposing perils, different kinds of perils. And that gives you a way that you can split your story into two and have two story strands going rather than one. Sophie! DICKS: The other thing, I think, is viewer identification. The Doctor is the other. So how can you identify with the Doctor? You are always saying, "What's the Doctor doing? What's he up to?" He's a stranger, he's not really human. But ah, now, here's the person that yes, I can go along with. And feel that she's one of us or he's one of us. SARAH JANE: (ON TV) Mrs Scarman? Hey. (SARAH JANE GASPS) That's... SLADEN: I am the audience. I am that little person watching and saying, "Oh, why's he done that, Mum?" You know, so you play that part. - Oh! Sometimes you don't seem... - Human? Typical Osirian simplicity. - A man has just been murdered. - Four men, Sarah. Five, if you include Professor Scarman himself. And they may be the first of millions, unless Sutekh is stopped. "Know thine enemy." DOCTOR: Admirable advice. Sophie! Sophie! Ahhh... Fifi from "Happiness Patrol". Get back, Doctor. I knew at once. You see, the real Sarah wasn't wearing a scarf. (GUNSHOT) What have you done with Sarah, hmm? Where is the real Sarah? SLADEN: There were so many things that happened fo Sarah on Doctor Who. I didn't realise until recently, when I was making a list of them. She met a lot of monsters. She was shot at. She was hypnotised, blinded, her mind was taken over. She was tied up. She was tortured. She was transported elsewhere through various methods of time and space. I mean, it was mental and physical. I don't think I can take much more. I used to reason out that why I made the same mistake every episode was I had this best friend, the Doctor was my best friend, and wouldn't you do something to help your best friend? It didn't matter if you fell into a bog, tripped over a twig every five minutes. You would just go for it and you would help him. And that was... motivation, if you wish. I think what's interesting is the way in which the programme has reflected changes in society. Back in the 1960s, all the Doctor's young women where just sort of there to scream and faint and collapse and be generally sort of decorative. Jamie, the Doctor! (SCREAMS) (SCREAMS) Polly, what's happened? Oh, Doctor! It was horrible! That's all the women did, scream and scream and scream. I think in my very first episode, when I met you, I screamed. Not at you, at the Daleks. For pity's sake, let me go! DALEK: Speak when you are told to speak! And I literally screamed for the whole year. I screamed my way out of the show. Help! Somebody! No! (SCREAMS) This accusation has been frequently levelled at the Doctor that he's somewhat sexist or patronising in his attitude to female companions. It's not without a certain amount of truth, I would say. You couldn't put your hand on your heart and swear that this was not so. You found something? Oh, Polly, I only wish I had. Why not make some coffee to keep them all happy while I think of something? All right. - Stand by, Liz. - Standing by, Doctor. LETTS: Though there was a companion who was a very clever scientist So she could talk to the Doctor on equal terms. Well, that was fine. They could discuss things and the science fiction fans or the scientists in the audience would know exactly what they were talking about, but the majority of the audience wouldn't. And so, quite deliberately, we decided to change it. - I'm your new assistant. - Oh, no. She said when she first met him, "Yes, I took science at A level." -1 took general science at A level. - Yes, I'm sure you did but even so. Later on she made a silly blunder and he said... I thought you took an A level in science? I didn't say I passed. I think we're talking, you know, James Bond and the bikini'd lovelies. I mean, no better and no worse. # La-la, la-la La-la-la-la-la-la-la # La-la-la-la La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la # It could be Mars or Venus But whatever he may do # He'll always be a friend of mine # Who? # Doctor Who # Doctor Who # Look, Jo, why don't you go and get out of that ridiculous garb? Okay. NICOLA BRYANT: I had a lot of questions asked to me about what did it feel like wearing a bikini on Doctor Who? And I thought, I felt fine wearing a bikini because I was swimming and I felt stupid wearing a three-piece suit. But I was very intrigued by certain shots that were put in, which I think other people enjoyed. (COUGHS) I think I'm going to die. PHILLIP HINCHCLIFFE: We had the idea of him having a sort of, um, a savage as a companion. In other words, doing a sort of Professor Higgins, Pygmalion, have that kind of relationship. The idea really was to make the girl assistant more... You know, less The Perils of Pauline and more able to be more dynamic, actually. I mean, I wanted a bit more of a sort of dynamic role model for the girls who watched the programme. In a house this size, there must be protection. The professor will have weapons in fixed positions, to guard the approaches. I brought you to the wrong time, my girl. You would have loved Agincourt. She was meant to be a cave woman. So that meant she had to wear an awful lot of chamois leather. Although in a way, not an awful lot because there was so little of it. It was a tiny little dress. K9: Negative, negative, negative... TURNER: She was immensely popular with the dads. 'Cause she came on after the football results. And so, you know, they just hung around with their cup of tea and caught sight of her in a leotard. The main thing was to get the adults involved in the programme so it was a sort of family viewing event. I believed that the stories should be very well-plotted and should have a lot of jeopardy and genuine excitement in them. (SCREAMING) (TRAIN APPROACHING) Violence in Doctor who is very difficult. The Doctor is involved in adventures that deal with violent people. And sometimes the only way to deal with violence, unfortunately, is to be violent in return. - How dare you touch me! - Oh! SAWARD: That's what I feel That if you display violence, you should show it for what it is. I don't think you should dwell on it. I don't think it should be gratuitous. But I think that when you do display violence, you should show it hurts. (GROANS) (GROANS) (SCREAMS) Now, last week you may remember we were discussing Doctor Who. Is it too violent for children? Well, perhaps it really came back to is it too violent for the parents? Inevitably, with any programme, there are complaints every now and then about the level of violence. And I think that's something that has dogged the show right from day one. To me, I think it's extraordinary that people with a brilliance, in many ways, and making a programme of that kind, couldn't have extended their awareness. Not only to their cameras and all the rest of it but to the effect of what they were doing upon the children who were receiving it. That was a... Almost as though they were a bit dumb. I must admit that quite often, you know, in my prayers by the side of the bed, I would pray that Mrs Whitehouse had watched the programme and thought it was too violent. 'Cause it automatically put two million viewers on our audience figures. We've received very good punch-in appreciation figures. Good! One particular programme, and I can see it still in my mind's eye, where Doctor Who... The final shot of the episode was Doctor Who drowning. You're finished, Doctor! You're finished! These sort of images, the final shots of the programme, with the image that was left in the mind of the child for a whole week. Some of the stories in my era were latched onto as being more frightening. But I don't think we ever overstepped the mark, in my view. And people seemed to like it because the ratings were very high. (SCREAMS) Sarah! Sophie! Sylv? Sophie? (GASPS) Oh, bloody corridors. We're always in corridors. -I know, this takes me back. - Lucky you're not in a quarry. (McCOY SHOUTING) (COUGHING) Dear, oh dear. (DOCTOR WHO THEME) Hi! I've just discovered I can increase the power of my Prime by five times In 111 seconds. Office automation, revolution. Accounting, no more books. Around the planet communications, instantly. I can design ships, run power stations, oil, gas. Where would the energy industry be without Prime? Ask it how to handle a woman. - Romana, would you marry... - Yes. Oh, Prime. - Clever Prime. - You can say that again. Clever prime. (DOCTOR WHO THEME) - No, it's not Doctor Who! - It's Friday! - It's 5:00! - And it's Crackerjack! Crackerjack! - Ah! How are you, me old friend? - Hi, there. - Now, what was it? - How are you doing? Which one was it we worked in? - Come on now, tell... - Um... -"Curse of Fenric". -"Curse of Fenric", ah. Haemovore. Haemovore, she woman. Me Doctor. How. Its structure of line and colour is curiously counterpointed by the redundant vestiges of its function. And since it has no call to be here, the art lies in the fact that it is here. (WHOOSHING) Exquisite. Because when I was working on Doctor Who, inevitably quite a lot of humour was in the programme, and some people liked this and some people didn't. I have to say that in fact the way the humour went into the programmes wasn't exactly the way that I intended it to. I say. A danger one runs, and I kept on running into this problem, is that the moment you have anything in the script that's clearly meant to be funny in some way, everybody thinks, "Oh, well, we can do silly voices and silly walks and so on." And I think that's exactly the wrong way to do it. (AUDIENCE CHEERING, THEME MUSIC PLAYING) Brigadier! What are you doing here? You're not even in this series. Yeah, no, that's perfectly all right. Harry had to go into hospital. (LAUGHS) Had to have his duffle coat removed. Of course. Ahhh! Quick, the lift door! Oh! Ah! My dear, I don't think he's as stupid as he seems. My dear, nobody could be as stupid as he seems. I think that Doctor Who is at its best when the humour and the drama work together. And that however absurd a situation may be, it is actually very, very real and has very real consequences. That's the moment at which something that's inherently absurd actually becomes frightening. We have the power to do anything we like, absolute power over every particle in the universe. Everything that has ever existed or ever will exist, as from this moment. Are you listening to me, Romana? - Yes, of course I'm listening. -'Cause if you're not listening, I can make you listen. Because I can do anything. As from this moment, there's no such thing as free will in the entire universe. There's only my will because I possess the key to time! Doctor, are you all right? Well, of course I'm all right. But suppose that I wasn't all right? This thing makes me feel in such a way I'd be very worried if I felt like that about somebody else feeling like this about that. Do you understand? - Yes. - What do you understand? That the sooner we hand this over to the White Guardian... BOTH: The better! - How's Mr Banerjee? - DALEK: He's not very well! - Why? - I exterminated him, too! Well, you shouldn't have done that. (BARKING) DALEK: Put him in the curry. MAT IRVINE:. The main problem with K9 was that he was designed for one story, which was set all inside a studio. When Tony Harding, the designer, actually put K9 together, he didn't know that he was actually going to go out on location at various times. And he'd have to go over grass and pavements and gravel paths. Because he had to be completely redesigned and there were still occasions when he would get stuck. DALEK: Put him in the curry! When K9 was first invented, he was working on a system of radio control that was in some ways now quite old. And the very first time he was in the studio he had a terrible job because he'd interfere with the cameras and the cameras used to interfere with him and he used to go haywire and drive into the scenery. This is why eventually we had to rebuild him and rebuild the insides, change the radio control system around so he'd be a lot more reliable. He's usually okay on a flat floor, but getting him in and out of the Tardis could be a bit of a problem. There was actually just no way he'd climb into the Tardis. - K9: Mistress. - Come along, K9. - Goodbye. - Goodbye, then. ANNOUNCER: And in London and the Southeast tonight, a world safe for Daleks. We talk to Tom Baker about his decision to hang up his scarf and travel through time no more. Well, thank goodness he's gone. Well, Tom Baker, this is extremely sad news that you're leaving the show, and K9's announced his resignation two weeks ago. So with master and dog gone, what's going to happen to the series now? Well, it will just go on and on and on and on, because it's part of our... television, isn't it? why should it stop? There's no evidence. Everybody's been very successful at it. But what's going to happen in the series? There'll be a new Doctor who, presumably. - There will, there will. - He will be regenerated. That's the trouble with regeneration. You never know quite know what you're going to get. We decided on a cricketing motif. Peter Davison and the cricket was a quite interesting sort of concept and obviously, if the series was on during the winter and I was away on tour, I'd get the wife to tape them for me and I'd sit down and watch the whole sort of winter series. Howzat! You've seen the sonic screwdriver being a great sort of a, if you like, a bit of instrument for the Doctor. And all of a sudden, we see a cricket bat and a cricket ball being swung around. But it was nice to have something like that to sort of say, well, he was the Doctor. He loved cricket You know, it was nice. SAWARD: I didn't think a young man could have played it back in the '60s. In the '80s, it was possible. The audience could more readily relate to him being 900 years old and yet, in reality, he was only in his early 30s. NATHAN-TURNER: When Peter decided that after three years he wanted to move on to something else, once again one was faced with this dilemma of trying to cast A, a good actor, And also someone who did not resemble the outgoing Doctor. - You are a Time Lord? - Yes! And at the moment, a rather angry one! I want to see the Cybermen dealt with as much as the Time Lords do. You weren't frightened, were you? Frightened? No, of course not. You can knock their heads off, you know. I zapped the Cyber Controller once, you know. And I enjoyed it. (CHUCKLES) BOTH: They're not so tough. COLIN BAKER: There is an essential Doctorness that runs through all the Doctors. And I thought it was a nice idea to draw heavily on William Hartnell. 'Cause he was number one. He was the guvnor. -It is? - Word for word. And that quality of his, of being a little bit, occasionally, could be construed as being unpleasant. You don't even know what a peri is, do you, Peri? No. I'll tell you. A peri is a good and beautiful fairy in Persian mythology. The interesting thing is before it became good, it was evil. And that's what you are. The most important thing about the Sixth Doctor was it was a very different beginning. The regeneration was very traumatic for him and so he... He came out rather disturbed. (PERI SCREAMING) (GASPS) (SOBS) I wanted to draw on the alienness as well, to make him more alien. I mean, it was particularly important coming straight after Peter. Because Peter Davison had been such a four-square fellow and kind and gentle and nice and accessible. So, I mean, it seemed sensible to make a contrast. (SIGHS) 1t feels different this time. (CREW MEMBERS TALKING, INDISTINCT) As I remember, the regeneration sequence was a very sort of stressful, tense time, anyway. I mean, it was emotional in that Peter was leaving the show. And it was emotional for Colin, in that he was joining the show. WOMAN: 173-D, take 2. Oh, Doctor! There must be something I can do. Tell me! It's too late. Going soon. It's time to say goodbye. Then Peter is moved out and I have to stay in the same position and Colin is placed in. MAN: So Nicola... WOMAN: Are you playing it down in the monitor here? - I'm glad you know what you're doing. - I'm going upstairs. You're going to go scrabbling up and you need to get to here. - Like that, okay? - Okay. Directly behind his face there. Thank you. BRYANT: There was a lot of special effects put onto Peter. - Adric? - You know that. You mustn't die, Doctor. MASTER: No, my dear Doctor, you must die. Die, Doctor! Die, Doctor! Basically, then, the new Doctor steps into the shoes of the old doctor by re-emerging in exactly the same spot. (SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) DICKS: The thing I always remember is how long everything seemed fo take. It was such an incredibly drawn-out process, I mean, how much did we get out of a typical studio day? Well, if you work it out, we... Each episode was meant to be 24 and a half minutes long. And you reckon one day of film per episode, exterior film, location film... It wasn't always, but.. DICKS: But on average. LETTS: On average, which would be three to five minutes maximum. So, yes, we were trying to get 20 to 22 minutes shot in one day in the studio. And of course it was always complicated with Who because we'd got the special effects. We were very keen on using chroma key, most of the world calls it And the BBC always insists on calling it Colour Separation Overlay, CSO. The blue screen process, so as you can put backgrounds in. There was an awful lot of patience needed for those special effects. Because they could go right the first time or they could go right not until the 46th time. MAN: Keep going, Liz. SLADEN: You really had to know where you were, no messing about at rehearsals at some point, because once you were on the studio floor, the special effects had to be the first consideration. Rehearsals, they were always fun. They were always wonderful fun. We didn't have to think of normal things. We were saving the universe. This is the Doctor, president-elect of the High Council of Time Lords, keeper of the Legacy of Rassilon, defender of the Laws of Time, protector of Gallifrey. I call upon you to surrender the Hand of Omega and return to your customary time and place. Ah, Doctor! You have changed again? We wanted to bring back the mystery. So that's why... Because we thought too much had been told about the Doctor. And also the slight danger... In the end, you are merely another Time Lord. Oh, Davros, I am far more than just another Time Lord. And I wanted to bring back the anger of the first Doctor, he was a crabby old man when he arrived. And I thought that was rather good. But I wanted to mix them all up and make this cake. We all have a universe of our own terrors to face. I face mine on my own terms. But don't you want to know what happened here? No! You've learned something you didn't recognise when you were 13. Like what? The nature of the horror that you sensed here. That's alien. Ace's character was very different, as far as I was concerned, from any other companion that had gone before. When I first read the script I thought, "This is a bit different. "She doesn't scream and she's got a Cockney accent "and she's a bit street cred and tough." There. You should be able to get up and walk about now. Cheers, Professor. McCOY: The thing about being a Time Lord is when I was being a Time Lord, we were never given enough time. Time was always the thing that you really wanted. That was the luxury that we begged for. We didn't want more money, we wanted more time. Just to get in the can. And we used to regularly... We'd come towards the end of the story, at the end of the shoot, we'd be in the studio. And it would become panic. "We've got to get this in in one." "No, no. We want it in in half!" Hang on, Ace! It was a frantic day. And we'd been really rushing because we had to get the tank done in this day. And I rushed over to the water tank and kind of got in it Had a quick test The visual effects guys were up on the fop, pumping water in over my head. "Doctor, look out." Then the Doctor comes in, all right? McCOY: And I was running up and banging on this... I mean, she's screaming and all this stuff. Suddenly I realised that the glass was bulging. And I just felt under my hands this kind of... (MAKES CRACKING NOISE) A crack. Doctor! McCOY: Shit, get her out! WOMAN: Get her out of there. McCOY: Move back, the water will... MAN 2: Everybody get back. MAN 1: Move back! MAN 2: Get the pump in! But it was actually Sylvester who saved my life because nobody really realised what was happening and he shouted, "Get her out of there!" And they reached down and grabbed me. That was the only time I've ever been heroic in my life. Except when I was acting. (CHUCKLES) Some people call it acting. What am I doing? I've got to stop. - We've got to go! - We can't go. - Not this time. - Yes, we can! Escape to what? I don't choose to live as an animal. If we fight, we will destroy this planet. NARRATOR: The series finished in December '89. we'll destroy ourselves! NARRATOR: The Doctor lives on in videos, novels and comics. But the fans still campaign for new television adventures. If we fight like animals, we'll die like animals! I think the Seventh Doctor and Ace are a very successful combination, which is why we use them in the comic strip. They're very popular with fans. They're popular with older fans who like sort of the mysteriousness of the Doctor and the younger ones who really latch on to Ace. They're a good combination. I also feel that a great many people think that Sylvester McCoy and Sophie Aldred did not have a good enough innings, if you like, on television. Sylvester always says that he's the last person to hear about everything to do with Doctor Who and then he tells me. And it was true in this case that I was actually rehearsing for Corners one day at the BBC and got a phone call through from Sylvester, who said, "Are you sitting down?" And then he told me that it had been cancelled. And suddenly they came along and said, "No, we're not doing it. Stopping it." And so I was slightly annoyed. I also thought it was a shame, really. Very short sighted. I felt like I could run forever. Like I could smell the wind and feel the grass under my feet and just run forever! The planet's gone. But it lives on inside you. It always will. Good. And the Master? Who knows? Where to now, Ace? - Home. - Home? - The Tardis. - Yes, the Tardis. DOCTOR: There are worlds out there where the sky is burning, where the sea's asleep and the rivers dream, people made of smoke and cities made of song. Somewhere there's danger, somewhere there's injustice, and somewhere else the tea's getting cold. Come on, Ace. We've got work to do. (GASPS) Well that's it. Doctor Who. Thirty years, who would have thought it? Things come back to haunt you just when you least expect it. Go! Now! DALEK: Do not move! You are my prisoners! The Daleks have command of the Tardis! THIRD DOCTOR: # I cross the void beyond the mind # The empty space that circles time # I see where others stumble blind # To seek a truth they never find # Eternal wisdom is my guide # I am the Doctor # Through cosmic waste the Tardis flies # To taste the secret source of life # A presence science can't deny exists Within, outside, behind # The latitude of human minds # I am the Doctor # My voyage dissects the course of time # "Who knows?" you say But are you right? # Who searches deep to find the light? # That glows so darkly in the night # Toward that point I guide my flight # As fingers move fo end mankind # Metallic teeth begin their grind # With sword of truth I turn to fight # The satanic powers of the night # Is your faith before your mind? # Know me Am I the Doctor? # Aha! (LAUGHS) (SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) MAN: Right, waiting patiently, thank you. He's a different person. You got enough? INTERVIEWER: We understand that you're in negotiations with Steven Spielberg for the future of Doctor Who. You may well think that but I couldn't possibly comment. You know what these things are like. You know there's endless discussions, negotiations. You know what the American networks are like. You know what Hollywood is like. You know what the BBC is like. You can't trust anyone. These things take a while. So there are no promises. DALEK: Stand still All allies of the Doctor beware! The Daleks have returned. DALEKS: We shall return! We shall return! We shall return! We shall return! We shall return! Goodbye! It's good isn't it, hmm?
