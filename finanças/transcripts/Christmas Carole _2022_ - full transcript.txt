Merry Christmas - Merry Christmas Oh Ohh Is this for me? Ohhh Merry Christmas! What a - load of old crap If I'd have wanted sickly sweet sentimental garbage I'd have got John Lewis to make it But we thought Because Christmas is about kindness and community spirit Cobblers! Christmas isn't about spirit Christmas is about shopping and stress and over consumption It's about traffic jams and family arguments It's about boring office parties and hangovers And most importantly for us it's about spending money that you don't have on useless presents you find online at 3 o'clock in the morning for that cousin you secretly hate That's what Christmas is really about And that's what we're going to cash in on So you want something more... explotative and commercial? Exactly! But with a joke at the end, because you know t'is the season to be jolly But Miss Mackay I really think - Call me Carole Carole, I really think what the consumer sort of - I don't care what you think I'm Christmas Carole! My company is called Christmas Carole and that's why at Christmas Carole we sell single use Christmas products wrapping paper, decorations - Well let's not call it that, let's call it seasonal homeware Cheap tat You see these? We make these for 20p and sell them for Â£6.99 and everyone will get through at least three because they are utter rubbish! And what do you think will happen to our profit margins if people start making this rubbish for themselves? Merry Christmas to you too - Come on Bobbie! I didn't think the ad was that bad Oh I liked the old man he was merry and sweet Don't you feel sorry for him? - No! He looked like a boozer Ahh, no cash! Have you got a card reader? Probably why he's on his own Wife left him She'd had enough of the endless cycle of misery and poverty and got the hell out of there Hopefully she took the kids with her Ahh! Can you believe it's snowing? - I know But maybe we should the whole reusing, recycling angle? I don't know if you've had a chance to look at my presentation that I gave you but I've got another copy here if you wanted to have a look Bobbie! Stop being such a misery it's Christmas Look, I care about the planet, I do I watch David Attenborough and Anette... Gretta Doodah... It just doesn't fit with the Christmas Carole business model And changing the Christmas Carole business model is a huge undertaking It's hardly something I'm going to do on the day I'm selling the company - You're selling the company? Limpopo are buying me out Limpopo? The massive American online retailer? - No, the river in Africa The deal goes through at midnight tonight - Wow I'm giving myself a hundred million pounds for Christmas - A hundred million? Wow I know! Carole, Carole, couldn't you at least - Bobbie, not now Look, Carole, What about the rest of the staff? Who cares! Oh Bobbie not you, obviously I need you to do all the boring stuff Now there's a livestream event tonight At the Limpopo building to announce the deal Starts at eight, be there at seven-thirty Don't be late What, wait no, Carole I can't what about It's Christmas Eve! Oh no Hey sis Going to invite us in? You know, it's Christmas Eve we thought we'd come down to London see the lights and - Boys! Remember what I said earlier - Whoa this place looks amazing - Don't touch anything! Don't bounce that ball inside Wow, this place is awesome, innit There's a pool and gym downstairs it's got everything Sam, that fruit's for adults No decorations I don't do decorations Ahh you should try it! We make our own I think if I was going to ruin the decor with a load of gaudy tat Rita I'd use my own brand I think ours look great the kids make 'em Well Kids make my decorations too so - C'mon throw it here - Mind that ball lads I said, no football Well that's a shame We got you a Christmas present auntie Carole The boys made it! It's recycled wool Who wants to watch my new TV? Ah cool! So look, the real reason we ahh came by was to errm to ask if you wanted to come to ours for Christmas dinner tomorrow I'm busy I know Christmas is always going to be difficult for us Well not for me! I made a lot of money out of it But it's time to see your family Well I've seen you now and Our mother's dead so... And what about our father? I don't have a father You mean Leon? It's been more than twenty years, I thought it might be time to move on Well you thought wrong Besides I don't think I could face Rita's plant-based roast turkey Plant-based food will save the planet! - But it tastes like crap And nobody likes your vegan mince pies either I like 'em! He doesn't Anyway, I expect you'll be wanting to get back That road will be getting busy The one that leads to Wherever it is you live Doesn't Christmas mean anything to you? Oh Rita, Christmas is a lie! It's a lie! Made up by German royals and American corporations and Charles bloody Dickens - And if people are stupid enough to think that putting up a dead tree and buying overpriced rubbish made in Chinese sweatshops by a bunch of eight year olds is enough to help them summon up a few days of Christmas spirit Then I will happily take their money Please Carole just... come home it's important - Come on kids, come on we're going Aww, I was watching that - Come on, let's go, now What time's our train? Why you taking us out? - She really have this place to herself? Oh, here Here's your present There's a message in there for ya No there isn't Call Bobbie Calling Bobbie Hello? Oh Bobbie, Oh, Are you on your way? I need you to pick up some more of my pills Hi Carole, sort of not exactly Well what does that mean? Well, I know you wanted me at the livestream thing tonight Stop stop I know what you're going to say You want to be with your kids I do, I do It's Christmas so want them all at home I understand Thank you, thank you Carole And the answer's no Please Carole You don't need me there Look, you'll be fine, you can do this No Bobbie, the kids will be fine Kids are tough You know I value loyalty above everything else I can't Carole I'm sorry I I can't So am I You're fired - What? I said you're fired - You can't be serious Oh I am You're right, I don't need you I'm about to get a hundred million quid I don't need anybody Why's the money so important to you? You've got millions Because life's a competition Bobbie Whoever has the most money at the end, wins There is nothing else - Please Carole, it's Christmas Eve! - Please Carole, I though we were Hello? Anyone there? Hello? Ahh! Hiya! Mama... Hiya sweetheart! But Are you? Still dead? Yeah babe, very much so Now, I've come back to tell you something very important Ooh! Ooh You don't look dead Thank you If you remember I did have quite a bit of work done All guaranteed non biodegradable Haha, oops! Oh my god! Ahh! Listen to me sweetheart, we don't have much time After tonight you will never see me again, ever This is the last chance I've got to explain things To tell you about the mistakes I made I don't understand IT IS REQUIRED OF EVERY MAN THAT THE SPIRIT WITHIN HIM SHOULD WALK ABROAD AMONG HIS FELLOW MEN What? AND IF THAT SPIRIT GOES NOT FORTH IN LIFE IT IS CONDEMNED TO DO SO AFTER DEATH Why are you talking like that? I've absolutely no idea, it just feels appropriate for some reason I know what's going on Your late husband was Philip Marley So you're Jackie Marley, Marley as in the other Marley Bob? No Jacob A Christmas Carol the book The stupid book that Ade gave me Jacob Marley tells Scrooge to be a nicer person and to buy a Turkey for... Tiny Tim who was in a wheelchair or something Hmm, is that it? Nutty family I'm hallucinating I'm dehydrated Listen to me you silly cow This is your last chance to change Just stop obsessing about money all the time Coming from you? Okay So I married a couple of rich fellers after your father But that's what I want to talk to you about It doesn't matter how you got it You had it and that's what counts What was it you used to say Whoever has the most at the end, is the winner Well maybe I was wrong about that It's not all I was wrong about Where you going? It's fine, I know the story I'll be visited by three ghosts YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND I won't be visited by three ghosts? Well yes, but there's more to it than that Christmas past, Christmas present, Christmas yet to come Urgh! Stop doing that!

Oh well errm Of course, those guys are going to lose their jobs All of them? We're innovators Carole Every successful innovation leaves some people behind, that's just how it is The rules are the same for everybody Carole If you're not making the millions, it's because you're too dumb or too lazy to take the opportunities presented to you Am I right?
