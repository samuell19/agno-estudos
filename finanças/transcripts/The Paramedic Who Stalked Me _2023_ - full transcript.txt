You had to do what? I love you guys. I still can't believe we're doing this. I told you I knew where it was. - Dude, you're crazy. - Totally. We're gonna get in so much trouble. Not as much as you, sneaking out in the middle of the night. Oh, yeah, aren't you grounded until you get your grades up? I am, but if they can screw things up, so can I. Hey, come here. When's your mom gonna cut you some slack? No idea, we haven't really been talking since Dad left. Your parents will figure it out. Or not. Nothing you can do about it. Right. In a couple of months, this will all be behind us, graduation, college, brighter futures. To brighter futures. Okay. That was a good one. Hey, Chloe? Damn it, Chloe. See you. Hm. ♪ Come closer, come and get it ♪ Only halfway, and we made it ♪ Maybe we'll go hit up somewhere ♪ ♪ Maybe we'll know when we get there ♪ God. You should answer. I'm on my way. Where are you? With Bryce and Lexi and Todd. Where exactly with Bryce and Lexi and Todd? God, Mom, I'll be there in 10. We're just over the hill on Mercer Road. Chloe? Chloe, answer me! Chloe! Chloe! Chloe! Come on, come on, come on, come on. 911. I-I think there's been an accident. My daughter, I was just on the phone with her and I heard a crash. You take the car, I'll get the truck. You got it, Sharice. Both the victims are in the car. Hey, can you hear me? What's your name? Are you okay? Hm. Hey, man, you hear me? Take it easy. How's the situation over there? I got four, ah, one deceased, two injured, but stable, um, I'm checking the fourth now. It's pretty shallow. It's my head. Just hold it right there. There you go. There it is, one more. Help me. It's all right. You've nothing to worry about, I promise. Everything okay? Just checking her vitals, she's stable. My daughter, Chloe, Chloe Braddock, she was in a car accident. - Mrs. Braddock? - Yes. I'm Dr. McAllister and your daughter's going to just fine. Initially, she was unresponsive at the scene, but that has since passed and now we are mostly looking at bumps and bruises. Thank God. And the others? The passengers sustained minor injuries. I'm sorry to say that the young man that was driving, he did not survive. Todd? Yes, ma'am. Oh, my God! Let me take you to Chloe, she's down in Lexi's room, I'm sure she's gonna be anxious to see you. Baby. - Mom. - Oh, honey. I'm so sorry. Oh, sweetie, I'm so sorry. Hi, can I help you? Hi, ah, I'm Matt, I was the EMT at the accident. Oh, I'm Karen Braddock, I'm Chloe's mom. Right. Ah, I just came in to check on her. You know, when I got there, her breathing was very shallow, I had to use the BMV just to get her back to normal, so. You saved her life. Thank you so much. No thank you is necessary. Well, I will, oh! There she is now. Hi, honey, aw! You were there at the accident, the fireman. Paramedic, but yeah, that was me. Thank you for saving my life. Oh, please, it was my pleasure. How are you feeling? Honestly, like I got hit by a car. Well, you're feeling about right then, huh? Honey, your Dad is worried sick, but he's trying to get the next flight out. Oh, from Australia? No, he-he shouldn't. I'll be okay. Mrs. Braddock? Yes? Could I have a word? Yeah, sure. I'll be right back. Okay. Dr. Rosen, 1878, Dr. Rosen, 1878. This way. It just doesn't feel real. I mean, we had our whole lives planned out ahead of us and now, Todd's gone. Oh. I get it, more than you can imagine. I'm sure you see this all the time. Yeah, but it doesn't make it any easier. I lost someone once, someone very important to me. I'm sorry. Thank you for everything you did for us. We were lucky to have someone brave like you. Chloe. This is my boyfriend, Bryce. This is, ah... Matt, I was the EMT on scene. Right. Hey. Todd. I know, I can't believe it. I should go, glad to see you're doing all right. Both of you. Thanks. I've been worried about you. Thank God you're okay. I just keep thinking about Todd's mom and dad. His thirdoffense, seriously? There's no way he'll avoid significant jail time, I promise. Well, excuse me if I don't have a lot of faith in those words. Well, this is different, it's vehicular manslaughter. Which could've been prevented, if the system wasn't broken and now a teenage boy is dead. Yes, I am aware, and I am sorry. But this time, he's going away for good. Oh, I'm sure that will make his parents feel much better. Mr. Talbot, this isn't looking very good. All those years of damaging yourself, smoking, drinking. Your liver's about to quit. Who are you? I'm the man who saved those kids you hurt tonight. One of them died, a teenager, did you know that? I'm sorry. Oh, are you, you're sorry? I didn't mean to. Yeah, I would love to believe that. Maybe I could, if it was the first time. But it wasn't, was it? When someone is truly sorry, they admit what they did. Guilt, remorse, shame, you're not capable of these things. You'll never change. I will. I swear, I swear I will. - Oh. - I'll get help, I will. You know how the system works, you'll be back out on the streets in a year, driving drunk, hurting innocent people. What are you doing? That sound doesn't irritate you? The incessant beeping and pinging. You know, when a dog goes bad, we put them down, to keep them from hurting anybody else. You took her away from me once, not again. What? Again? What-what are you talking about? Not this time. What-what are you doing? What, uh! I wish I could tell you this is going to be painless, but it won't be. Consider it penance for a lifetime of sin. No, please, no! This is for the best. Matt, are you coming to bed? Ah, in a minute. Hey, what are you doing? Ah, just finishing some work stuff. What kind of work? You know, just, ah, paperwork and stuff. Come to bed, you've been up all night. Okay. Dr. Valentino to the O.R. please. Dr. Valentino to the O.R. please. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you. I was just about to check in for my shift and so I thought I'd come see how you're doing. That's sweet, you didn't have to do that. It's no problem. You were right about being sore, it's hard to do anything right now. Oh yeah, well, it should go away in a few days, just take it easy. Is something wrong? Ah, yeah, I just, I can't find a bunch of my stuff, my keys, my necklace. Oh yeah, well, did you look everywhere? I think so. Do you mind if I look around? Yeah, go ahead. Well, look at that. I-I thought I looked there. No, sometimes you don't see what's right in front of you. So that just, ah, leaves my necklace. You didn't happen to see it last night? It wasn't really my focus, sorry. Right, of course. Special to you though, huh? Yeah, it is. I can keep my eye out for it, I'll check in with the nurses, see if they've found it. Thank you. Hey, so I heard the drunk driver didn't make it, huh? He didn't? Yeah, I don't know what happened, but he passed away last night. Good. Chloe! What? He killed Todd. Still, a man died. He deserved it. Don't say that. Hello, Matt. Hi, Karen. They pulled me in on my day off to do a bunch of paperwork and I was just heading out, I thought I'd come and see how Chloe's doing. You must be very busy, following up with all your patients like this, must keep you away from home? Mom. Your wife, girlfriend. Mom. I'm married to my job right now, just being a paramedic and helping people. Good to know. All right, you ready to go? Yes, please. Well, I'm glad to see you're doing better. Karen. Bye bye. Thanks... for everything. Of course. Karen. I'm sorry I snuck out. And I'm sorry I was so hard on you, but you almost died and after what happened with your dad, I just couldn't take it if I lost you too. You didn't have to lose Dad, you chose to do that. He chose! Don't you ever say that, he chose, when he decided to have an affair on me, he chose. Look, I understand how you feel, I just hope one day, you'll be able to understand why I had to leave him. I'm gonna head out and pick up your meds and get us something great for dinner and I just want you to relax and get some rest, okay. Okay. I'm so happy you're home. Me too. - Oh, sorry. - That's okay. Hi. Hey. Is something wrong? No, no, not at all. How did you know where I live? Ah, the hospital had it. I think I have something of yours. Oh! No, but look closer. Oh, my God, you found it! Where was it? In the wreckage. That's so weird, how'd it even fall off? Well, it's more common than you think. It probably got caught on something in all the transporting. Yeah. The chain had snapped, I replaced it. You didn't have to do that. Here. Oh, thanks. It's my pleasure. I know your life has been thrown into chaos and this might help. Thank you so much. Oh, Bryce will be thrilled when I tell him, he got this for our one-year anniversary. Ah. Well, I'm happy I could help. I should go, I have a shift tonight. Of course. Thank you... for doing all of this for me. Maybe I'll see you around. Probably. Well. Thank you for this. It's my pleasure. You ready to go? All set? Yep. Ah, that was quite the nap. You were out cold. I guess I needed it. Yes, you did. It'll help you heal faster. Ah, oh, you found it? Yeah. Actually, Matt did. Matt, the EMT? Yeah, he just came over earlier and dropped it off. He came here to our house? What? How did he get our address? I guess he saw it on my chart at the hospital. Well, why didn't they just call and tell us? I would've picked it up. He knew how important it was to me. Seems odd. He's just trying to be helpful. I mean, God, it comes with his job. Well, he's just been around a lot, last night at the hospital and then this morning, when I picked you up and now he comes to our house. Mom, stop, he did save my life. Besides, I'm sure that's the last time I'll see him, so. Hmm. Hi. Hi. Chloe, you home? Chlo? Hello? Where'd you go? Work. I had to review the supply order. Who is she? What are you talking about? There's someone else, isn't there? Tell me the truth. Hey, baby. That's not an answer. There's no one else. I can tell when you're lying to me. Where is this coming from? From you, I mean, the way you've been acting lately. You're different, distant. I've had a lot on my mind. Work stuff, that's all. I still don't believe you. I told you there's no one else. I deserve to know. There's nothing to know! How could there be? I'll always love you. Hey, Mom? Yeah? Did you move my prom photo? No. Why would I do that? It's not here! It's gone. Well, it must've fallen. I looked, it's not on my board. It has to be there. It's not, that's what I'm saying. What? I don't wanna scare you, but when I came home earlier today, I could've sworn someone was here, I thought it was you. Well, why'd you think that? Noises, and it just felt different, like a sense of somebody being here and then I found the backdoor unlocked. Do you think someone was in the house? Oh, I don't know. Keep looking, you'll find it. The community as a whole, I think it's a win-win for everybody Absolutely, thank you and hey, take your liberty. Oh, I appreciate it. - Thank you. - All right, thank you. Sure. Chloe. I didn't know you went to school here. All right, class, so in light of the recent tragedy, the school thought it would be a good idea to hold a refresher course in CPR training and to help us with that, please welcome Matt. Thank you, Mr. Harrigan. Thank you. Well, some of you I've met already, in fact, I was the first responder at the accident Chloe was involved in, and Bryce. So, in any sort of life-threatening emergency situation, what you know how to do, and do correctly, could be the difference between life and death. Today we're going to start with a demonstration of the defibrillator. Now, this is an amazing tool to save countless lives on scene. I will need a volunteer. Bryce, quit hiding in the back and come up here. Come on, Mr. Davis. Today. Just here. Lie down flat please, shirt open. The defib, as we call it, is used to reset or even jump-start the heart of a patient, who's no longer responsive. First, you take the conduit paddles and place them firmly on the patient's chest - right against the skin. - Ah! Press the buttons on the handles, this sends a very strong electrical charge into the patient, jolting the heart. Probably be a good idea to turn it on first, right? Now, it's also very important, that you don't overload the charge, doing so risks organ damage and potentially death. Now, once it beeps, that means it's ready. Like that. All right. No one touches the body. You wanna place the paddles firmly, one on the upper side of the chest, the other below the left pec, near the heart. Ready? Mr. Harrigan? Clear! - Bzz! - Uh! Relax, Bryce, I'm a professional. Go ahead and have a seat. Everybody give a round of applause for Bryce, huh? You're a good sport, buddy, thanks for the help. Now, I'm going to do a demonstration of CPR and since I already know this procedure, I will need another volunteer. Chloe. If you would? Come on up. So what we're going to do is we're going to place our two hands firmly on the chest of the patient, five compressions, short but firm. Chloe, you're gonna have to do better than that, we're trying to save this man's life here. Now why don't you pretend that it's me? You have to push through the muscle. Ready? One, two, three, four, five. Nice work. Now, the next thing we're going to do is we need to tilt the patient's head back and apply two breaths. That was amazing. Great work, huh? You can tell she's had some practice making somebody's heart beat fast. Who wants to go next? Hey, what's up? Matt came to my school today. What? For health class after everything that happened. Okay, this is going a little far. You were right, something's definitely off. But what can we do about it, go to the police? For what? It's not against the law to be helpful. So what would they need to do something? Proof that he's done something illegal. You mean like breaking into our house? Sure, if we could prove it. Maybe he'd listen to a little nudge. A nudge? It's a start, I'll see you at home. Oh, my God! What? I know that look. I have an idea. Oh, no, what happened to the nudge? Chlo, what happened to the nudge? Matt. Mrs. Braddock. Can we talk for a second? Sure. Um, look, we really appreciate everything you've done, but Chloe's doing just fine, she's fully recovered, so we can take care of her now, okay? Did I do something wrong? Chloe said you came by our house. Yes, I stopped by, I was just returning the necklace, as she had lost it. And her school? Well, the school called here, they were looking for someone to teach a CPR refresher and well, I volunteered, but, sorry, I'm-I'm confused, where is all this coming from? I'm just a little concerned, that there's something more there, that maybe you're interested in her romantically. Oh, God! And she's in high school. Oh, my, no, no, no, no, no. I-I'm so sorry if I came off that way. I feel bad for her. I guess I figured if I brought the necklace by, it would make her feel better. Oh and by the way, I do have someone special in my own life, so. - Okay, good. - Yeah. Well, so now there's no reason to keep crossing paths, understood? Whatever you say, Karen. Hey, we're off on Oxy and Hydrocodone, did you forget to log any? Not that I'm aware of. Did you check with the other crew? Their count is fine, it's ours that's off. That's weird. So are you sure this is his place? Yep. Let's go. Can I help you? Hi, we're just going to... Oh, you must be the girlfriend Matt's always talking about. He talks about you all the time. I'm surprised I haven't seen you up here before. I live just over there and I see everybody that comes and goes. Actually I am his girlfriend, he's mentioned you as well. Oh. Oh, this is my brother. - Oh. - Lucas, he's joining us for dinner. - Hi. - Oh, nice to meet you. And I feel really stupid, but I forgot my keys, he said he left you an extra set. No, I'm sorry, he hasn't. Oh, but there's the Hide-A-Key that he leaves just in case. Let me see. Ah, here it is. Thank you. Yeah. See you later. Bye. Enjoy your dinner. She said he has a girlfriend. So? So what if she's here? Hello.? Anyone here? All right, let's look around, see if you can find anything that looks familiar. Okay. Bryce! Find something? He took this from my house! Oh, my God! Oh, my God, I think that's my car. - We gotta leave now. - Yeah. That's weird. We should go. Let's see what else we can find. I can't wait to tell my mom when she gets home. Really? What? This whole day has been like really stressful. I promise you, I'm quitting, tomorrow. Oh, my God! What? Matt was in a car accident just like ours with a girl named Hayley Stillwell. They were on their way to their prom. You've got to see this. Chloe. What? Chlo, s-something's wrong. Oh, my God, Bryce! Bryce! 911. Please, it's an emergency! Please hurry! All right, this should be it right here. Are you sure this is the right address? Yeah, Sharice, this is it, this is it. They said 18-year-old Caucasian male, right? Possible O.D. All right, let's do it. Come on, Bryce, come on. Where is he? Um, in here. Is that Bryce? Oh, no. Hey, Bryce, buddy, talk to me. Pulse is weak, breathing shallow. Hey, Bryce, buddy, can you hear me? Did he take something? No, he, ah, he used his vape and got woozy, he said something was wrong, he just collapsed, I don't know. Narcan, now. - Matt! - I'm looking. Is everything okay? They're not in here, dammit! Is he gonna be okay? I'll check the cab. - Hurry. - Got it. Don't worry, we've got this. Hang in there, kid. Please save him. Is he gonna be okay? What is he doing? He should be here by now. Let's just hope you didn't take too much of that. I've got it. He's gonna be okay, I used an inhaler, but he's in bad shape, we need to get him to the hospital right away. I'm gonna stay here with him, you go get the gurney. Matt, let's go. I'm coming with you. You can't, only if you're family. He's my boyfriend! You can meet us at the hospital. Relax, I'll take good care of him. See you there. Hey, buddy. Look what you did to yourself. No! He okay? Strap came loose. He's trying to kill me. He's all right. You don't look good. He's crashing, charging to 200! I don't think he's gonna make it! Are you sure it can't wait? I'm sure. We're gonna lose him! Hang in there, buddy, I got this. Don't worry. I'll take good care of her. How is he, did it help? Checking. Oh, you stubborn, little brat. Still nothing, charging to 225! Let's see you survive this, huh? He's crashed and now he's unresponsive. I don't know, he just fell. You were talking to him and he just falls over? Yes, yes. Mrs. Braddock? How is he? Stable, but he's still in a coma. How long will he be like this? It's hard to say, couple of days, maybe longer. I expect him to pull through, but he could have some memory loss. None of this makes any sense, I mean, how could he just fall into a coma? He O.D.'d. What? The toxicology report shows that he has a significant amount of narcotics in his bloodstream. Narcotics? We also found traces in his vape pen and several pills in his backpack. Pills, what kind of pills? Oxycodone, Hydrocodone. No, I-I know Bryce, he doesn't do stuff like that. I understand how you feel, but the report tells a different story. He must've been hiding this from you. Thank you, Doctor. We'll figure this out. We'll figure it out. Come on, honey, come on. Eight, nine. Everything all right? Just checking supplies, while we're here and I found this Narcan needle in there. Oh, weird, it must've just fallen back there, huh? Yeah, it must have. I'm gonna go get a coffee, would you like one? No, I'm good, thanks. Hi. I'm Sharice, Matt's partner. I feel like I might have run into you once or twice before. Yeah, and I feel like we've been seeing a lot of your partner lately. How do you mean? He keeps showing up, at our house, at my daughter's school. What? I'd like you to talk to him and tell him to back off. I will. Good, thank you. Where's Chloe now? With Bryce. You know, those drugs that that boy overdosed on, they were very serious, I'm surprised, he and your daughter don't seem the type. They're not. I figured. I'll be in touch. Okay. Thank you. Dr. Forrest, dial 118 please, Dr. Forrest, dial 118. Can I talk to you? Something wrong? Chloe's mom feels like you are spending a little too much time with her daughter lately. Are you into teenage girls now? No. You go to her school? Her health teacher invited me. So he just invited you out the blue? He had your number? The whole thing was his idea. Look, her mother is blowing this way out of proportion, okay. What, do you think I'm some kind of a stalker, is that what you think? What about the missing stock? There is no missing stock. The count is off, I told you. I counted again, we're good. I'll tell you what, have me drive tonight, all right? I haven't been pulling my weight around here, I know that, and judging by your lack of response, you agree with me. I wanna step up more. Emergency services requested at 428 Hawthorne, corner of Seventh. That's us. Matt was behind this, you know that, right? I mean, he put something in Bryce's vape and he planted the pills on him. How could he do that? I think he did it today when we were at his house. You were at Matt's house? I found my prom photo. Chloe, you broke into his house? We didn't break in, we used a key. - That's still trespassing. - Okay, well, it proves, that he was there the day that you heard noises in the house. Yeah, but now it's inadmissible. I know, I just had to do something. I don't blame you for wanting to do something, but now we can't go to the police with that. I know. I found something else, an article about Matt, when he was in high school. He and his girlfriend got in a car accident on the way to the prom and she died. And you think that's why he stole your prom photo? Maybe. Oh, my God! This girl, Hayley Stillwell, her family lives down in Macon, I'm thinking maybe if I go down there tomorrow. - Chloe, no! - Mom! They'll listen to me, their daughter was my age when she died. Please just trust me. I can do this. Okay, I trust you. Thank you. Dammit! I think I took a wrong turn, my bad. Let me turn around. Crap! I think I hit something. Dammit, Matt. Dispatch, this is Unit five, we're gonna be delayed to the scene. Copy that, Unit five. Matt? Matt! Matt, respond! Uh! You should've kept your mouth shut. Unit five to Dispatch. Dispatch, copy. Requesting emergency back-up. We've been attacked, my partner's down! Unit five, received and understood. I've got your location, I'll get you some back-up right away, stand by. Calling all Units, we have an emergency, man down, man down, corner of Gotham and Fourth, I repeat, corner of Gotham and Fourth. Hey, sport, that's a good look for you. Bedridden. You know, some people just can't handle their Oxy. Goodnight, buddy. What are you doing? Just making sure he's comfy. What did the Doctor say? That he'd be fine. Oh, that's good, glad we got to him in time. What happened to your head? Oh, it's a hazard of the job. Ran into some trouble last night, bunch of guys were out dusting, killed my partner. What? Drug addicts, I think. Well, I am so sorry. It's a dangerous world out there, Chloe. I hope you can see that now. As a matter of fact, I don't think your friends are very good for you. What? Obviously, Bryce has been keeping this from you for some time, he has a problem. Bryce doesn't have a problem, you do. I know you did this. Me, what are you talking about? I saved him. No, you tainted his vape pen. And when would I have done that? When we were at your house yesterday., taking back my prom photo that you took from my house. And who's gonna believe that, Chloe? You know, bad things seem to happen to people around you, Bryce, your partner, Hayley Stillwell. Face it, Matt, you're not very good at saving people. I saved you. You'd be dead without me. I'll call the nurse. Where is all this coming from, Chloe? What happened to you? Nothing happened to me. Something happened to you, you've changed. This isn't the real you. Is it your mother? Is she putting all these crazy ideas in this little head? No. Maybe I need to have a little talk with her, huh? Stay away from my mom. Chloe. Come here. Get out. Chloe. Now! Okay. I'm going. You have a nice day. What's her name? What does it matter? Do you love her? Yes. More than me? I can't stay here anymore. If that's what you want. That's what you want. The kitchen's great. I'm so glad you loved it. We're definitely interested. Great Well, have your broker get me your offer and I'll pass it to my clients, okay? - Absolutely. - All right, great. - Have a good day. - Thank you. Hm. So Matt was dating your daughter, when the accident happened? Yeah, Matt and Hayley were inseparable. They planned their whole lives together. It was sweet, Matt was always a romantic. He had just picked her up and they were on their way to their senior prom, a drunk driver came out of nowhere. Matt tried to save her. The paramedics said they had to pull him off her, drag him away. He must've really loved her. She was his whole world and he was hers. That night changed him though. Changed him, how? Well, he forgot all about college, decided to become an EMT, determined to help people. Huh. Save them from the pain he experienced. But you don't believe that? Oh, it changed him, just not for the better. I think it broke something inside him, it was like something dark had taken root. Well, thank you for sharing, this has been very helpful. Hey, you've got wings too. Wings? Hayley had the same necklace. Oh, no kidding? You wanna see a picture? Sure. Matt got it for her for her 17th birthday. She hardly ever took it off. Huh. Hello. Hello? Hi there, hello! Karen. Matt. What are you doing here? I'm sorry, I didn't want it to be like this, I just want her to love me. Oh, my God! You're really sick, aren't you? I just want a second chance. I was really hoping I could call you Mom. Oh, my God, Oh, my God, Oh, my God, no, help! Somebody help me please! No, no, no! Please, no! Uh! Hm. Someone should call a paramedic. Mom? Mom, are you here? Mom? Matt. Welcome home. Where's my Mom? I did it for us, so we could be together. Someday you'll understand. I can wait. Love is patient. Love? That's all I want is for you to love me, love me like I love you. Oh, my God! No! Ssh! Ssh! Fine now. It's all right. It's okay Relax. Just let it take you. Sleep now, I have a surprise for you. Oh, my God! Chloe? Oh, my God, Chloe. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Answer the phone, answer the phone. I found my prom photo and I found something else, an article about Matt when he was in high school. He and his girlfriend got in a car accident on the way to the prom and she died.

We're meant to be! Chloe! Where are you? Mom? Mom! Chloe, I'm over here! Where? In the hallway, follow my voice! I'm coming! This way! You're getting closer, I hear your footsteps! Mom, Mom! Chloe? Mom? Oh, my God! He's coming. I called the police, they're on their way. How do we get out of here? This way, this way, come on. It's that hallway, then to the left. Okay. There it is, the exit, the exit! Look out! - Mom! - Oh, my God! Run! Chloe, stop fighting this! Chloe! Stop running from me! Chloe! You'd be dead without me. Uh! Uh! I'd rather be dead than with you. Mom. Mom, Mom! Okay, come on, come on. Mom, it's over. - It's okay. - Oh, Chloe, Chloe. Hey. - You're back. - Kisses. Matt? It's okay, he can't hurt us again. You know, I love you. Look who woke up. So why all the crying? I'm just happy to have my family back. There you are. I found you. Of course.
