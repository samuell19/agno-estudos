Mom, the teacher said I was wrong and punished me to stand under the sun Brother shared the punishment too.

This is a Gymnasium Ain't no a temple I know, but a Manchu monk is staying here - What? You mean we're monks? Shiyu, you... Brothers, perhaps you don't know. Manchurian isn't considered polite They won't come without invitation Where's the monk? - What are you doing? Hand me the Manchu monk. - What monk? We're looking for a monk. - Let me teach him a lesson The door is locked. What should we do? - Unlock it Stop fighting Unlock it. - No Stop Shiyu... You Han bastard, how dare you make trouble in here You want to die? - Shiyu... You died tragically!. - Throw him out Manchu, it's not easy to kill me. - You... Not bad Get me the Manchu monk You bring me the Manchu monk now. - What Manchu monk? The monk in your gym. - Shit! We've no monk here Han bastard, you intend making trouble here, is it? Guards, take him out and behead him Do it if you can Stop and go now Run! - Don't chase! We're military officers, we shouldn't chase the Han bastard - Yes You've nowhere to go Step aside... Whenever something is wrong, it must be caused by your Canton School Do you know what kind of people are in this school? I know. You're Qin imperial gymnast. - It's good if you know But still you did it. Obviously you're against the law Chief, we didn't do over the limit and did such a thing. - Right. We maintain strict discipline of our students here Don't deny. I've fought with the kid Only Cantonese can fight like this. He must be a Cantonese. - How does he look like? He isn't tall. But he has sharp eyes Judging from his style, he'd have practiced kung fu for a long time. He has 2 brothers You should know who is he. Bring him out Chief, he is not our student He isn't? - He isn't here. Really Yes or no? - No Really? Within 3 days, you must hand him over - or your gym will face consequences Shiyu. - Dad, why should you use force? I'll take full responsibility. I'll go alone Wait, master. - Tsui-hua, no need to plead for him If we don't hand him to them, our student will be in trouble Master I know I shouldn't beg you again. But when I came here, - Shiyu was my only son. - This son brought us a lot of trouble, isn't it? The day he stepped on the fighting stage has made serious trouble He nearly ruined the gym. - He fought for the good of our Cantonese But it's different now These Manchus are relatives of the royal court If we don't hand him to them Not only the gym will close down, - but we'll also have no place to stand. I've decided. - Master If Shiyu is dead, don't you still have 2 sons? Mom, dad is right. I've died once I don't care about it this time. - Shiyu. - Mom, when I'm not here, - there'll be no one to upset you. No one will break your heart Mom, don't be sad. Punish brothers when I'm not here What? Punish me? Dad, I'll go on his behalf No! - Right I may go. - No, you... - I pay for what I did! No, I'll go myself Quiet! - Dad, you can't let brother go Let's all go together. - You'll go together? Master, you can't let them go. - What can I do? If all of them go, Fong's family will end... Master, don't worry. I've an idea. - What idea? Hide them. - No way The people in the gym only know of Shiyu Right. We won't go out. - No. They may come here Don't worry, we can send them to Shaolin Temple Shaolin Temple? - The temple is a reputed martial school It's a taboo to the court. They won't make trouble over there Okay. Go now The abbot wants to see you Miao Tsui-hua paying respect - to master Zhishan and fellow masters May Buddha bless you. - Tsui-hua, I know you're here with a purpose I say this first, the temple won't approve your request Uncle, we're from the same school Please take my sons in. - You want them to become monks? I don't want to be a monk. - You fool! On your knees To continue the Fong's family, please take them as secular pupils These kids are savage. You must have spoiled them too much I know I'm wrong. - We don't adopt pupils like them If you don't take them, they will be killed. - Shaolin temple isn't a hiding place. Leave Uncle, Li Bashan revenged for Tiger Lie, trying to kill Shiyu Master Wu-Mei had saved him He fought for the Cantonese people now and offended the Qin gym Uncle, how can you... - Tshui-hua! Bring San Te Abbot. - San Te What's the matter? Manchu monk! You're here! - Shiyu! Fong Shiyu, why are you here? - So what? Bastard, be polite Mom, the day we went to the grave he went with the Qin gym Fong, you teased the Qins If they know it's you, they won't let you go I'm a monk, trying to protect you I had to get along with them You misunderstood master San Te, making the governor to shut down our gym To shut down the Canton gym? - Yes. To shut down the school or - bring Shiyu to them So do you want me to take your sons as secular pupils? That's right Master, please consider my plight. - What about the closure of the gym? What's your plan? - I'll take the blame for them Mom, you... - Buster, kneel down! Chief. - 3 days have passed We really don't have such a person. - You don't? Close it! Stop! Who are you? - I'm the mother of Fong Shiyu Fong Shiyu? - Yes The one you say has offended your gym. - Where's he now? He's in Shaolin Temple. - Shaolin Temple? Come with me! Chief. - What's the matter? We'll have trouble if we go there casually. - Trouble? - Yes The temple may accuse us of offending their holy place The Shaolin temple always covers up criminals Chief, Fong Shiyu is the student of Canton gym We don't care much. Close it. - Okay. Close it Stop! The one who offended your gym... is my naughty son. It's got nothing to do with Canton gym I'll take the full responsibility. - You? - Yes Tsui-hua, you can't Who's he? - My husband He's your son. No doubt you don't hand him over Chief, it's all my fault. Please forgive it You Cantonese are tight-knit families Chief, enough. Do anything you like You have guts. I appreciate it Fong De. I wouldn't shut down your gym... if you let me have your wife. How could it be? No worry. Chief likes me It's my great pleasure. - Tsui-hua, you... Master, you've heard. Chief says if I marry him, he won't shut down the school Right. - But I've a request What is it? If you can split my legs, I'll go with you If not, you must forget all about my son Chief, are you afraid? Chief, no trick. Use your strength to do it Again. - Split it... Shut up. Let's go Tsui-hua, you're great. How are you? Hurry! Hurry! No hand. Go! Up This chamber trains the strength and the lightness of your body It's called Jumping up the Roof. - Jumping up the Roof? Breathe in and out No hands. Breathe in and up Up... The wall isn't steep. Why can't you make it? Master San Te. This skill seems superficial Brother, come down! Fong Shiyu, after you're born, you've been trained by your mom Of course they're no match for you. But don't take this skill as nothing Fong Shiyu, this wall isn't superficial? Brother... Mom begged hard to have us stay here You still mess around here... If we're expelled from the temple... Mom can't do anything! - Listen! Practice with other brothers Yes, master Brother. San Te's kung fu is really good. - Of course If not, he can't be the chief of the 36th chamber I'll be better than him after a few years. - Fong Shiyu!

He asked me to come down You know Hans aren't allowed. Do you want to be beheaded? Beheaded? My neck is harder than your blade Where are you from? - Shaolin Temple Shaolin Temple? - Don't listen to his bullshit He's trying to scare us. There're only monks in the temple No layman over there? So you don't know. The 36th Chamber is for secular pupils You still bluffing. - Stop. Tonight is the Lantern Fest Good to have this hero here display his skill - to highlight the show. Don't spoil the mood I'm the governor of this province. What's your name? With all respect, Governor I'm Fong Shiyu who fought for the Cantonese I've heard of you before. Fong Shiyu, you're the hero on the fighting stage So why've you joined the Shaolin Temple? - My mom aspires for me to learn more It's good... Then the 36th Chamber must have many secular pupils like you Governor, I can't tell you this. Rules of the temple, you see Oh, right. Their rules are strict. How could you come here? Master San Te knows I've practiced hard. As a special reward... He allowed me out on my own to relax. Guess it's time to go back to the temple Wait a moment! - Governor, what do you want? Mr. Fong, don't misunderstand me. It's just that I appreciate your Shaolin kung fu. If I've chance... On 15th of next month, there's a tournament I hope you may join it Tournament? I can't come out during daytime. - You refuse my invitation I can come at night. Continue. Goodbye. Thanks Sir, you just let him go I want to find out about the 36th Chamber of Shaolin Sir, you've a thorough mind Good morning. - Morning It's dawn. Get up! Time to practice. Get up! It's dawn. Get up! Everyone may have a face wash. - No hurry. The supervisor hasn't come yet I want you guys to get up. - Shiyu, it's not yet dawn Why did you wake us up? - Quiet... I've something to show you. - What is it? Here, have a look. Isn't it beautiful? I told you I will show you the lantern. Right? Isn't it beautiful? C'mon, get up! - Good morning Fong Shiyu Hurry up. Master Shiyu, are you practicing? - I know it all by now No need to practice Shiyu, as our pupil you've to obey the rules Start from the beginning Okay Stop. - Master, should I stop? No. I want you practicing alone. - Me alone? You've companions Brothers, what are you doing? Listen. The skill of water post isn't that simple What are you looking for? - I'm Fong Shiyu The Governor invited me. - Spear down Martial art heroes You're Fong Shiyu. - Yes. Who will be the winner of the tournament today? None of your business The Governor asked us to stay to see how good Shaolin kung fu is You mean you want to fight with me? - Mr. Fong Governor. - Don't misunderstand. I invited you to come not to fight with them I just want to witness the specialty of Shaolin kung fu It's my pleasure to have a demonstration But by rules of Shaolin we're not allowed to publicize it Is it that strict? Then no one can tell if the Shaolin kung fu is good or bad I know it myself! - Fong Shiyu, I practice kung fu too If a skillful fighter like you can't bring his skills into play, it'd be so miserable, wouldn't it? Indeed so. - The Qin Empire is different though We hold the tournament every year It helps the fighters to bring their skills into play Like this weightlifting. Wrestling, fist fighting, weapons... What I learn in Shaolin is not that superficial That means... For example, it's called Jumping up the Roof everyone in the 36th Chamber has got to learn this skill. - Right Besides, the Water post Come on. Look at me. Follow me. In two rows, hands out Harder This is the Water Chamber's Wrist Movement Excellent. What're the other chambers? Sir, I want to fight with him. - Mr. Fong This is today's winner. Would you like to fight with him? Okay. I haven't done this for a long time How can you be the winner? You've no patience Right. Take your stance first. Discover your enemy's weakness His skill is good but he doesn't use his brain He knows nothing about cheating. Am I right, sir? Sir, he's right What else can you tell me? - It's simple In a one-to-one duel pay attention to your enemy's every move Sham palm, use kick Dodge when you block a kick. You won't suffer like this Throw him down... Sir Stop. Mr. Fong. Shaolin kung fu is really good Each movement is both tough and supple. - Thank you I wish... for the coming tournament in each of the province the Hans will take part with the martial arts - it may break the barrier between Han and Manchu people. Only then peace - can prevail in Nation if you do think in this way when I'm back to the temple I'll discuss with my brothers Good. It's nice of you to take my suggestion. Bring the Yellow Vest Yellow Vest? - Yes. - What does it mean? I offer you this Yellow Vest. Next time when you are here, you'll be free to come and go at will. - Thank you, sir Hold your breath. Rest your mind. Fong Shiyu, what did you show to others? Nothing, master. - Really? My qicong is good. They all admired me That vest. - Right. - It's beautiful Go out Shiyu, how did you get this? - You want to know? I'll tell you after the lesson. - What are you doing? Stop! Whose is this? - It's mine Yours? It belongs to the Qin martial artist Head master, you're very smart. - How did you get it? The credit is ours No one amongst the Qin martial artists in Fujin province can match with me Fong Shiyu, you participated in the tournament? Yes. If not, the people outside couldn't know how good the Shaolin kung fu is Fong Shiyu, you violated the Temple's code Master, I did it just to make our skills well-known. Is it against the rules? How did you go out? To do something that I consider right... - I've my own ways Fong Shiyu, being a Manchu's running dog. Is it a good thing? Fong Shiyu, you broke the 12th rule of Shaolin's 36th Chamber Sneaking out in less than five years You broke the principle of Shaolin; all because of money and fame I didn't break any rule. I'm trying to use their strength to revive Ming Absurd. You're too selfish. Can you achieve this alone? If I don't do it, who else will do it? Shiyu, you broke the rules. You don't feel guilt and still argue Abbot Zhishan, there must be somewhere I could be accepted I must do something note-worthy to show the world this time I'll offer my respects to you later Master, see you again. - No harm, no foul Shiyu... - Brother... Shiyu... I'm leaving. - May Buddha bless you Shiyu, though haughty, is a promising young man Yes, abbot Mr. Fong. - Mr. Bei, Mr. Le, Mr. Xi Mr. Sha, Mr. Governor. - Arise... Shiyu, what wind of sudden interest has brought you to the Governor's House here? Sir, this isn't his 'pleasure' visit. He's... I've been expelled from the temple. - What? Expelled from the temple? Okay. Don't be nervous. - Yes Shiyu, what kind of joke is this? I'm not kidding. I'm expelled by San Te Really? What rules did you break? - It's because of this vest This vest? - Yes. - What the hell! These monks are too much Guards, come with me to Shaolin temple Governor... Don't act on impulse. - Why? Sir, you always admire the secular pupils of the 36th Chamber This vest doesn't have anything to do with the secular pupils It's just San Te's personal prejudice If a tall he is biased he should have come to talk to me Why did he expel you? So you shouldn't send in forces or they may accuse you of bullying Shaolin You'd better take it up with San Te Shiyu, you stay here. - Thank you Send an invitation card to monk San Te now. - Okay Bring a group of fighters and kill Fong Shiyu tonight Kill Fong Shiyu? - Right. He's of no use to us now To kill such a person will only do good to the court Governor, it's no good. Why kill Fong Shiyu alone? Why not even kill a few more people like him? - What do you mean? You see, Shaolin's 36th Chamber takes in those secular pupils I'd rather have all of them killed. - You're right, sir I'll burn the temple tomorrow. - That won't be such a good idea Why ever not? - To burn it down is an easy thing for the Qin Empire But it'll offend the Han people When their power grows it'll be too difficult to finish them It's not difficult. - Go on We could weaken them bit by bit. - Bit by bit? We'll have to induce secular pupils out here Right. We must invite more pupils I mean, whoever Fong considers good in kung fu Governor, these 9 men are promising Their skills are as good as mine. - I like competent young fellows You invite them to come here. - Didn't you say, you wanted to invite monk San Te alone? Before inviting San Te, I'm calling your brothers here first - is to show our unbiased view towards you all in order to reassure San Te Governor... - Don't be hesitant On 3rd of the next month we've wedding between Manchu and Han girl I want it to be a grand party. Then the Han and Manchu would be at peace There'll be a big banquet in my house Availing this opportunity... I want the martial arts heroes to be good friends with your brothers Your plan is very meaningful. - Right. Governor wishes that after they become friends, - I mean, even though the governor resents the Hans you may even vent - your grievances for any injustice done by the Court to the Hans Shiyu, you're back! - Brothers, long time no see Don't wake them up. - Master will discover it Why are you here at this hour? Why? - C'mon guys, be quiet! Tell me, anything delicious to eat? Shiyu Chun, you've always been fond of food. - Quiet! If master finds out that Shiyu has sneaked in, we are gonna be in deep shit! No need to be scared of him. Your skills are already very good. What do you mean? Shiyu, is it you? You've been here in Shaolin for a long time. - What do you mean? It's not the right time. I don't want to alert the temple now Shiyu, be careful of their tricks. - Right So I'm here to ask for your help To come with me to get an idea of the situation Master will punish us. - Don't worry Here's the official invitation from the governor for the wedding. If there's anything wrong, - they dare not fight openly against us Master. - What now? Chief, no sign. - No sign? Go in and see. - Okay Brother, look. - Hong Xiguan.
