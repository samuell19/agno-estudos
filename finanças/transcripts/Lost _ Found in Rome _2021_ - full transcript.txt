Emma, the guests are here. Everyone's been asking about you. Come on, this charity event was your idea, remember? Go away! I never wanna see another man for as long as I live! What did Hank do now? Um, Hank was last month, Mr. Thorndyke. She's upset about Evan Richmond. Do I know Evan Richmond? It's the young man Emma's been seeing for the last three weeks. We just broke up over Twitter! What? Why? You're for it and he's against it? Oh, Dad, you're so clueless. I think she means on Twitter. You know through text messages. What kind of relationship is that? One that doesn't exist anymore. Look, uh, sweetie, come on, whoever this Evan guy is, he's an, he's an idiot. We all love you. Please join us. Do whatever you have to do to make her come downstairs. She has got to make an appearance, all right? I'll try, Mr. Thorndyke. And goats is not enough. Emma, your father's gone. Can I come in please? Hey, Stan, you made it. Samantha, thanks for bringing him. This is really good cause. You know, I mean, a healthy body leads to healthy life. That's what they tell me. And look, genuine yoga goats, I mean who can resist them? Hey, folks, the demonstration is about to get underway. But I also wanted to remind you, we're raising funds tonight for the upcoming marathon, Running With Goats. Yeah, really, I kid you not. Jen, why do guys stink? Um, 'cause most of them don't shower enough. How could he say that I'm shallow and not independent? Babe, you're 27, and you're still living in your father's house. You're taking his side? No, I, um, never really liked Evan, or Hank, or- - Gary. Gary for that matter. So you're saying I've got bad taste in men. Great. You just, you choose style over substance. It's my mother's fault. Emma, she's passed away 13 years ago now. Yeah, and if she hadn't she could have given me advice on men. I mean it's minefield out there, and every guy I seem to meet is like a grenade. They pull their pins out and they explode. That sums up the opposite sex quite accurately. I'm done. I'm gonna run away and join the convent. Okay, but before you do, can you go downstairs and greet the guests. Remember PR means public relations. That only works if you can relate to the public. Public? A bunch of overweight blimps pretending to support physical education when their belts can't even support their bellies. No thanks. There are some also very in shape, hot personal trainers and athletes, and some really adorable baby goats. And thanks to you I'm gonna be Hoover-ing up goat hair for I don't know days, maybe weeks. Evan was right, my life is pointless. He's wrong. I may be your dad's PA, but I'm also your best friend. Yeah, and what does that say about me? Ugh, it says you need to stop feeling sorry for yourself, go downstairs or I'm gonna slap you in your face, and it's gonna hurt. Fine! I mean, fine, I'm gonna go in five minutes. - Okay. - Just give me a second to make myself hot again. Ah-ha, and here she is, your cohost for this evening and the love of my life, my daughter, Emma. Now let's get this party really started. Five minutes, Dad. - What? - Mm-hmm. Come on, these are some wonderful people. I mean this young man here I met him at the athletic club. You haven't even seen the goats. You look great. Enjoy yourself. Of course I've been to Wimbledon numerous times. I just finished up the tournament in Dallas. Won 40-love. Are you a tennis player? Uh, that is my racket. I'm Emma Thorndyke. Oh, your father invited me here to give tips on how to stay in shape. Oh, please, tell me more. I'd be happy too. Here we go again. So are you Italian? Si. Oh, I do. My name is Nick Milano. Please, call me Nick. I just finished the tour of USO. Did you win? I rarely lose. But for me it's not about the outcome, it's the playing of the game that matters. Therein lies the fun, the challenge. Oh, I like games. I could tell that the moment I saw you. I said to myself, "Now here's a woman who could teach me a thing or two." Oh, well, I know very little about tennis. Oh, it's not too difficult. First there is your stance, the way the player stands before hitting the ball. You have closed stance. Mmhmm. Neutral stance, semi-open stance. Okay. - And open. - Oh, open works for me. Next your grip is very important. Oh. There are many techniques here. Okay. Western grip. Eastern grip. Continental grip. Let's go for continental. Next you need to hit the ball on the sweet spot. That's, uh, the center of the racket. Oh. I always aim for the sweet spot. Then there is the stroke when you hit the ball. Hard? Always hard. It is what makes me a pretty, very good server. Well, if you're the server then what does that make me? The receiver of course. And how long does that go on for? Until last set. Oh, I like the sound of that. But, uh, unfortunately, I have to leave tomorrow back to Roma. The life of a professional sportsman. What do, Emma? Oh, I keep busy too. Um, helping my father, and organizing events like this one. That's wonderful. No, you're wonderful. Coming here for such a good cause. Perhaps one day you and I can play a round together. Oh, I'd love to play a round with you, Nick. - Until then. - Mm-hmm. Game, set. Oh. Match. Oh. I'm telling you, Jenny, this is the real thing. Nick is the one. You've just met him. Yeah. Haven't you ever heard of love at first sight? Yeah, with your check's in the mail and I'll still respect you in the morning. Uh-uh, you're wrong. You didn't see the way he looked at me. It was a real connection. And he said, "He'd love to see me again." I'm gonna surprise him, and show all my stupid exes and my father that I can be my own independent woman. Come on, Jenny, please I need your support on this on. Okay, what are you gonna tell your father? Oh, nothing. I do not want him to know where I am or what I'm doing. Nick and I are gonna be completely self-sufficient. On your father's credit card? No, Jenny, I have my own credit cards. That he gets the statements to monthly. Right. I'll just bring cash. 10 grand should be enough for a week or so, right? Oh. And you, you don't believe in banks? Oh, there's plenty, plenty more in the bank. This is just my mad playing money. Mad is right. You can't go around with that much cash on you. There are muggers everywhere. Good call. Emma, just take one credit card in case of emergencies. Okay. I really hope you know what you're doing. I have never been so certain about anything in my life. That's actually a scary thought. Your dad's really gonna miss you, you know. I'll contact him once Nick and I are happily married. My dad may be rich, Jenny, but he's lonely. Having all the money in the world without anyone to share it with is just not for me. I need love in my life. I need Nick. I just hope Nick needs you too. You know, I think he does. Okay, I can do this. It's the first day of my new life in one of the most romantic places in the world. I don't mean this place. I mean out there in Rome. What, excuse me. Do you speak English? Uh. My luggage is missing. It never got off the plane. And all my things are in it. Um, can you please help me? Lost and found. What? Lost and found. You must go to lost and found. Ah. Just a minute, I'm almost done. I wanna speak to your supervisor. No, you don't, he's a jerk. I'll be the judge of that. Where is he? I'm the supervisor. What seems to be the problem? I've been waiting here for over 40 minutes. I've bene working here for over four years, but you don't see me complaining. My luggage is missing. Oh, really? When's the last time you saw it? Oh, I don't know, maybe when it was loaded onto your stupid overcrowded plane that serves stale pretzels. Ugh, I hate it when that happens. Uh, what's the name? Emma Thorndyke. Ooh, sounds painful. Look, you lost my luggage and I demand you to find it. That is your job is it not? Uh, only on the weekdays. Buongiorno. Ciao, Russell. Hello, miss. Can I be of service? I hope so. Uh, this is, uh, Alex, our best employee here. Well, our only employee, this is a small airport. Big enough to lose my luggage. Can you describe the missing luggage? Yes, so it's a large pink suitcase with flowers and cats all over it. Real ones? Customs might have an issue with that. Pictures. And don't judge me, my mother gave me that suitcase when I was 12. It has great sentimental value. I understand. You are American no? I live in California. Flight 232 from LAX. 232. Got it. We will locate your suitcase in a day or two. Wait, are you kidding? What am I supposed to do until then? All my clothes and personal belongings are in that bag. The airline is very sorry for the inconvenience this is causing you, so we'd like to offer you this. What is it? Well, this is a little travel package. We have a comb here, a little toothbrush with some toothpaste for those pearly whites. Little, uh, thing, you know if you want your beauty sleep, and this wonderful unisex t-shirt. No, no, that's it. I wanna speak to your superior. Everyone's superior to Russell. Don't mind him. I will find your suitcase, I promise. Fine. But all my money is in that suitcase. The ticket cost me $942. The bag fee was $50. I bought some water in the terminal, so I'm broke. I've got $3 to my name, which is Emma by the way. Oh, Alessandro, Alex. Pleased to meet you. I'm not. Well, I would be. Do you have, uh, credit cards? Oh, just the one, but I can only use it in case of an emergency. You know some people might think this situation is an emergency. Uh-uh, not me, because you're gonna fix it. You promised. Do you have, uh, any family members? No, no, family, it's just me now. I'm relying on you. My life is in your hands. So let, let me think, uh, one second, uh. Yeah, maybe I know someone who can help you temporarily. Great. Well, then let's go. I hate airports. Uh, this is why I'm not nice to customers, just saying. The Colosseum. So first time in Rome? Yeah. Do you know a guy called Nick Milano? He's a famous tennis player. I can't say I do because I don't. Is he a friend? Mmhmm. Well, soon to be boyfriend, then my fiance, and then my husband. I've got it all worked out. Sounds like it. Does he live nearby? Oh, I hope so. I'm here to find him. Why don't you call him? Oh, well, I wanted to surprise him. He doesn't know I'm here in town, and I don't actually have his number or know where he is, but that's okay. As soon as I find my bearings, I'll begin my mission tracking down Nick Milano. So where do you live, Alex? In a small place in town, very small, but my parents have a nice farm near La Fattorietta. They grow tomatoes and, uh- - Oh, Roma tomatoes, I eat those. No, no, Roma tomatoes are actually grown more in the United States, Mexico, and Australia. We have a different kind of tomatoes, very special. Where are we going? Uh, I have a friend who owns a cafe. There's a room upstairs. Hold up, I'm not shacking with some random Italian guy that I don't know, unless his name's Nick Milano. Don't worry, my friend is not Italian or a guy. So Emma, this is my friend, uh, Diana Jensen. And Diana, this is Emma. Thorndyke. Yes, exactly. Uh, from California. Right, is the young lady that lost her luggage. - Mm-hmm. - Oh, no, I didn't lose it, they did. Oh, yeah. You know the same thing actually happened to me 10 years ago. And you're still here waiting for it? No, they, they found it. They found it. I just stayed for other reasons, and I opened up this cafe. So um, Alex here tells me that you're strapped for cash. Oh, well, only until they find my suitcase. Well, I, I actually have a spare bedroom above the cafe. You know food and rent are not for free, so are you willing to do a little bit of work? Work? You mean as in like work? Oh, yeah, just standard definition of work. What, what kind of work? Uh, you wanna guess? Oh, this is like a coffee shop, right? Yep, coffee shop. So cleaning and let's see serving customers. You are gonna get the hang of it. You are. Yeah, I mean, I'm an independent woman, so I can do it. Find my suitcase fast. Yes, I will let you know as soon as we have located it. I gotta go now. Ciao. Emma. Oh. Good luck. Well, why don't I, um, show you to the room and get you all setup. Um, all my clothes are in my missing suitcase. Yeah, I figured as much. I think I got you covered. Come on. Great. Gone? What do you mean gone? Where did she go? I don't know, Mr. Thorndyke. She just said, "She needed to get away for a while." She wants to become a little bit more self-sufficient. I'm all for that. But to leave without saying goodbye, what the heck? Does she hate me that much? No, Emma loves you, I know she does. She just needs to find herself. I'm sure she's fine. And she's a lot more resourceful than you think. And I bet wherever she is she's got everything under control. Uh-uh. I can't go out like this. I look like a street urchin. You look like a girl that works in my cafe, which is exactly what you are. So what part of California did you say you were from? I live in L.A. Well, why don't you try to get some rest. I will see you downstairs bright and early in the morning, seven a.m. sharp. Seven? Now pay attention. First there is caffe. Caffe literally does translate to coffee. Caffe is also a shot of expresso. It's served in a tiny, hot cup, and customers drink them all day long. Caffe corretto, which is a shot of expresso corrected with a shot of liquor. The most common additions are grappa, sambuca, or cognac. Cappuccino, which is probably Italy's most famous coffee. Caffe latte, well, it's basically an American latte. One third espresso, two thirds heated milk, and a little bit of foam. Americano is a shot of espresso, layer of foam, and sprinkle of cocoa powder in a glass mug that's also been dusted with cocoa powder. Macchiato. Shakerato. Caffe al ginseng. Caffe d'orzo. It's her again. How do you know that? 'Cause the phone's ringing. Pronto. Emma. Your suitcase did get on plane but it was the wrong plane. We're thinking Japan. Yes, once I get confirmation it's there, I'll immediately get it on the next plane out to Rome. I promise. Pronto, Emma. Hello? Bad connection. Sure. I told you not to get I involved. Russell, this is our job. We are responsible. You like her don't you? You're crazy. I just feel sorry for her. She has no family, she's alone, no money. Hmm, sounds like your type. You know nothing about my type. And she told me, "She's in love with another guy." Sounds like exactly your type. Stupid, you're stupid, and you know that. Relax, you're gonna do just fine. Okay, look, there's a customer. Uh, how can I help you? Shakerato. Does that mean small? No, he just want's a cup of ice coffee. Remember this is not Starbucks. Okay, okay, I'm sorry. It's okay. Small. Um, what just happened? What did you make him? Um, he order a caffe corretto, so I made an expresso with a shot of cognac, sambuca, grappa, and some Irish cream just like you said. Oh. Okay, Emma, that was or not and. - Oh. - Yeah. Uh, look, see my customers they come in here for just a little pick me up not to become alcoholics. Yeah, I'm sorry, Ms. Jensen, but you know I've never had to serve anybody before. Yeah, um, what, what exactly did you do for money back in America? Oh, I just got it and spent it. Um, look, why don't you go in the back and just sweep. Can you do that? Yeah, yeah. - Okay. - Now? - Yeah. - Okay. Yeah. Finely, I was starting to get concerned, and your father's already worried. Oh, I know, he's been calling and leaving messages but I haven't responded. Okay, but are you okay, and how's Rome? Oh, I'm surviving. But they've got me working in a coffee shop. What? It's a long story. Okay, so can you tell me everything? Well, you know what I actually feel like Cinderella but during the bad part of her story. You know when like they make her clean, and like work, and stuff. Like that's me honestly. No, I'm not lying. I'm cleaning right now. You'll be okay. Oh, you know you own big time for this favor. It's not working out, huh? Look, she's, she's really sweet but she doesn't have a clue. I put her in the back so she could just clean up. Or not. I'm really sorry, Diana. But I didn't know where else to take her. I just felt bad for her. I know, honey, listen, I do too. I think she's actually escaping an abusive relationship back in the States. - No. - Yeah. So I mean, obviously I wanna help her but I wanna keep my business open too. Emma, she's gotta know somebody else here. Yeah, she told me, "She was looking for a guy." Okay. Named, uh, oh, dear, Nick something. Uh, Nick Milano. Milano? - Yes. - Milano? Why does that sound so familiar? He's a tennis player. Um, yes, I think. I never heard about him. But she said, "She has a plan to marry him." But she might be a little, you know delusional. Mm-hmm, you sure do know how to pick 'em. Well, those glasses were piled up way too high. They almost killed me. You found it, my suitcase. Yes, Russell located it in Japan, and it was shipped right out. Great, will it be here tomorrow? Not quite, it's just making a little detour to Iceland first. Iceland? Yes, uh, there was a slight communication problem. Italy, Iceland, it's understandable. - It happens. - Oh, I gotta get out of here. Yes, that is a great idea. Actually, look, I'm about to close up, so why don't the two of you go get a little dinner, huh? And I'll go reorganize what you just reorganized. Well, as long as you don't need me anymore, Ms. Jensen. I, I don't need you, so go have fun. Where should we go? Out. I know a place. Great. - Ciao. - Ciao. Oh, no thank you. I do not wanna see another coffee for as long as I live. What kind of coffee is that? No, I just asked for the check. Oh. So I'm still a little bit confused about your Cinderella analogy. Right, well, I was starting to freak out, so I called my friend, Jenny from back home. She's also my assistant. You have an assistant? Oh, yeah, sure. I've got assistants, cooks, maids, drivers, you name it. I'm like rolling in dough, but not the type Ms. Jensen uses to make her pastries. Oh, my money's in my suitcase, but I'll pay you back, I promise. I believe you. So Cinderella? Right, okay, so I realized I was like her but before she met her prince or her fairy godmother. Although, you could be my fairy godmother now that I think about it. Nobody's ever called me that before. Well, probably because you're a guy. No, actually maybe Ms. Jensen is my fairy godmother and you're like one of the mice that transforms into the horse. Oh, no, no, no, you're, you're the, you're the dog that becomes the footman. That's you. You're too kind. Well, all I know is Nick is my prince and we're gonna live happily ever after once I find him. Like in the fairy tale. Exactly. But first I need to find the glass slipper, which in my case is my missing luggage. But if memory serves correctly doesn't the prince find the slipper, and then he goes searching for, uh, Cenerentola, Cinderella? This is a modern version. Cinderella just has to do a little bit more legwork this time around, which is fine. I'm up for it. That's okay. I got the leg, see. Whoops. Yes. Very nice. Well, I've gotta be in shape if I wanna be marrying Nick Milano, tennis player extraordinaire. Nick Milano. Oh, you've heard of him? Si, everybody knows Nicky. I don't. You're not a woman. So do you know where I can find him? I believe Nicky's out of town for a few days. He went to Spain for the weekend, so like Nick. Another tennis match right? Si, Nicky's always in demand. Yeah, he's a pro, I told you. I can wait for him to return. What are you doing for the weekend? I have to go help my parents at the farm. A farm? Like in the country? Yes, that's where they're usually located. Great, well, I might join you. No, no, uh, no. I'm not sure you would have much fun. We are not nearly as well-off as you. Oh, that's fine, I'm all about trying new things these days. Except the bread. So you had dinner with her, you make any moves? No, there were no moves made. And what is so astonishing about Emma, she has nothing but a sense of entitlement. American. Yeah, she's living in a fantasy world. She thinks she's rich. Just never met anyone like her. Is that a good thing or a bad thing? All I know is once we get back her suitcase she won't be my problem anymore. That's right. Pink with kitties and flowers. That's great. It arrive on Iceland, and is now on flight 1642 on its way to Istanbul. Istanbul? No, Rome, Italy! It's suppose to going to Rome, Italy! You know big Colosseum! Are you kidding me? It's suppose to be going to Rome! Stop laughing! The universe is out to get me. Istanbul. Oh, Alex, really why are you doing this to me? Do you hate me? No, I'm, I'm not gonna tell her. Because I'm trying my best not to kill her. Yeah, that's all on you. Mm-hmm. Well, you're gonna have to do it. Good luck with that. Okay, uh, I gotta go. Ciao. Well, good morning to you too. Did you sleep well? Well, you know the bed is a little harder than I'm used to, and the pillows are a bit fluffy. The blanket could definitely do with a good clean, but I'm not complaining. Sure, I mean it sounded like you were but I know. No, Ms. Jensen, you've been so great to me. And you know what? I predict that I will not break one glass today. Although, I don't think I'm gonna be here for much longer because Alex assured me my suitcase will be here today. I got an idea. Why don't you take a few hours off and go find Nick? I'm sure he'd love to see you. I know likewise. But I heard he's in Spain this weekend. Right. Uh, okay, here. Right. You know when I first came to Rome it was because of a guy as well. But I wasn't chasing him, I was actually, I was running away from a really bad marriage. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. I mean perhaps I'm getting this wrong but I kinda feel like maybe you're running away from something too. Well, to be honest, you know I haven't had a lot of luck with guys in the past. They think I'm spoiled. - Oh. - I think they're jerks. 99% of them are jerks. But I mean not all of them. Some of them are actually okay. Like Alex most of the time. And Nick. You know me and Nick are gonna be so happy together. Like he just not like the others, you know? Mm-hmm. We have such a strong connection, and we've got even more in common now. Oh, yeah, what's that? Well, get this, so he's a tennis player, right? Mm-hmm. So he's serves balls for a living. Uh-huh. Hello, I'm now serving coffee. That's something right? We're both servers. That is something, that is something. Should I go open the door for business? Be my guest. I already am. You wanted to see me, Mr. Thorndyke? Yeah, Jenny, I, uh, just printed out Emma's cellphone bill. Uh-huh. So according to this, you are the very last person she called. Mm-hmm. Therefore I assume you can tell me what she's doing in Rome? Hi, uh, right, so we've got the, the macchiato, uh, the caffe d'orzo, caffe corretto, caffe doppio, cappuccino, um, and Americano. Right, let's start that again. Um, the macchiato? Right. So you get one of these. Um, yeah, just, just pick one. Um, Emma, Emma, I think I'm gonna be serving the coffees from now on. Oh, okay. Should I make new ones? No. - Clean? - No. Um, uh, how about groceries? We need more groceries, wanna get them? Oh, shopping sure. I'm really good at spending money, Ms. Jensen. Great. Okay, here we go. Awesome. - Oh. - Ah. Uh, no, no. No touching. Oh, but how do buy them? Okay. Oh, how much are these? Uh. Oh, okay. - He means you. - Si. Oh. In Italy we do it ourselves. I talked with Diana, she said, "She sent you here." Yeah, I mean this shopping thing is so complicated over here. Can't be that different from the States? I don't know I've never been grocery shopping. Then how do you eat? With my mouth. Right. Oh, you have servants and, uh, butlers back home. Exactly. Great. This working thing takes work. Oh, I've some news about your luggage. It arrived. No, but we know exactly where it is. Alex, I can't live like this. I'm a girl, I've got needs. Oh, my goodness finally. Oh, yes. You need all these? Oh, this is just the bare minimum. Besides I have to look my best for when Nick returns from his tennis tournament in Spain. Nick? Nick Milano? Oh, you've heard of him? Si, Nicky is the best. The best tennis player you mean. Yes, he's give great lessons. Is he back? Oh, I heard in a few days. Isn't it nice that Nick is willing to share his knowledge to others? Si, yes. This Nick seems like quite the player. Hmm. That much? Ugh, well, I guess the time has come. So this is the emergency? Well, obviously, otherwise I can't buy what I need. Uh, no good. Oh, no, the card's fine, there's a $50,000 limit. Uh, rejected. What did he say? Rejected. English. Rejected. Oh, no, that has to be a mistake. Can you please try it one more time? Jenny? No, it's your father. So how's Europe, hm? Having fun? Any issues with your credit card? No. How could you, Dad? How could you? How could I? How could you? Chasing after a doggone tennis player all the way to Italy. I mean you might as well have run off with one of those goats from the fundraiser. Oh. You don't understand, Nick and I are in love. Let me speak to him. Well, he's not here at the moment. He's in Spain. Emma, please come back. I'll, I'll, handle your plane ticket. I do not want your money. I can take care of myself, Dad. Oh, yeah, Jenny tells me you're broke. You lost all your money. I'm fine, I'm working now. Working? Doing what? Goodbye, Father. She's never worked a day in her life. This I gotta see. Emma. Oh, Alex, you shouldn't have. I know, but you said you needed these things. You're so sweet, Alex. I promise I'll pay you back. Right, once your ship comes in. Well, my suitcase, yeah. Who was on the phone? Oh, just a very bad man but I don't wanna talk about it. Did he hurt you? Well, yeah, you could say that he did. He has no respect for my dreams, my desires. He just thinks I'm a little foolish girl. Sounds like you're better off without him. Yeah, darn right. But now I'm all alone. You're not alone, I'm here, and so is Diana. Oh, if you want to tag along I'm still heading up to my parents' farm near La Fattorietta. Oh, yeah, I'd love to come. A peaceful weekend in the country that's exactly what I need. Great. My parents will be thrilled. They love houseguests, I suppose. Uh, so you paid for her groceries, and you're taking her to see your parents tomorrow. I already told you I don't like her. Oh, no, you don't like this girl at all. Okay, okay, whatever you say. So did you find the luggage? Yeah, and I'll make sure it gets on the right flight here. You don't worry about it all right. Just have a fun time at the family farm. Everything here is under control. I can imagine. All right, see ya, dude. You done? All fine and dandy, happy? Uh, what seems to be the problem? Okay, so tell me about your parents. I mean why did they become farmers? Well, in Italy most don't become farmers. We are kind of, uh, born into it. It's a family generational thing going back to my grandparents and their parents before them. You must have grown a lot of tomatoes throughout the centuries. I suppose we have. And then what led you to the lost and found department? Got sick of the tomatoes? Not at all, actually I still love them. Was purely financial reasons. You know the farm hasn't been going to well lately, and I needed to, to get, you know another job. Sucks to be poor, right? You tell me. I wouldn't recommend it. But cheer up, I mean you guys can't be in too bad of shape. I mean you live in Italy, look around. Most Americans can't even afford to visit Europe let alone live here. I mean the plane ticket alone. Oh, Alessandro. Ciao. Lost and found friend, Mama. - Oh, yeah. - We met at the lost and found. I'm Emma. Hi, Emma. Martina. Hi, I'm Roberto. Welcome. Oh, thank you. Ah, you are thin as nail, my dear. Do you not eat? Oh, well, you know I could do with some tomatoes. You came to the right place. Even so she's a bit different. She still believes in fairy tales. Always looking on the positive side despite the situation. And Diana believes she hard life. Doesn't have a penny to her name, but won't let it stop her. She should fit right in. Ah, just be nice. Don't believe everything she says. Alex, if you like her, we like her. Here you are. Mmm. It's the best tomato sandwich I've ever tasted. Grazie. You know I used to pick tomatoes in my garden with my mom when was really young. She loved to grow things before she got sick. Be careful, Emma, because my parents will put you to work, huh. Oh, I don't mind. I knew I liked you from the first time I saw you. So would you like to see how the best tomato paste is made? Like it, I insist on it. Okay. Oh. You can do it. I'll let you. Well, tomatoes are our business. We have of course san marzano, pomodorino vesuviano, pisanello, ciliegino di Pachino, camona, we have a lot. Costoluto Fiorentino. Costoluto Fiorentin, it's a little bit dry. That's why usually we are using it for salads. Oh, okay. Yes, and in the winter when it's too cold outside we keep growing them in a greenhouse. Oh. Oh, right. You can do it. See. Way too hot. Mmm, it's good. Buono? Never stop, never stop. 'Til tomorrow never stop, never stop. It's delicious. You know you can pick some tomatoes while they're still green. It let's them to continue to ripen and guarantees fresh ones. Yeah, I remember my mom always saying, "They should be smooth and shiny," right? That's right. See I know a thing or two. - This. - Okay. Oh, yeah. It should have a earthy, sweet smell. Oh, it's nice. Then you have to squeeze it to test the firmness. Oh. Oops. You have to be a little more gentle next time. You should really market these tomatoes. We do. This is our livelihood. No, I know, but I mean really market them, so the whole world knows how delicious they are. Oh, no, thank you. I'm not really a fan of the bread over here. Try it with Martini's homemade tomato spread. Okay, if you insist. You know we send our tomatoes out to all the markets and to wholesalers in jars, cans, boxes, in this jam. This is amazing. Balsamic tomato spread, my own secret recipe. You know Diana's cafe could really use some of this. She's got bread and pastries but it's not that good. This would make a huge improvement. And that restaurant that we were at the other night, they could really use this stuff too. That's not a bad idea. I could ask Diana if she's interested. I bet my father could sell this in the States. He's really successful at importing and exporting goods. That's where he made his millions. He just know what makes money you know. Well, we both do. He used to call me his little financial genius because I had great taste, especially with things that taste great. We could really use someone like you. You know it's been a hard year for us. The weather has been very hot in July and August. Oh, you need more greenhouses then to control the conditions, right? That cost money, Emma. Yeah, well, a good investment is a good investment, that's what I always say. I never heard you say that. Well, because I only say it when I'm talking business mode. This is probably not appropriate dinner conversation but I'm telling you, you're on to something here. So Emma, are you here, are you in Rome for business? No, pleasure. I'm in love with Nick Milano. He's a professional tennis player, and we're gonna get married. So any further questions. Uh, cheers. Cheers. Cheers. Ciao. Well, I had a great time. Good. Your parents started acting a little strange after dinner though don't you think? Yes. I think they thought that, uh, we were dating. You and I? Yes, as in we. Oh. That's, that's silly, right? - Right. - Right. I'll let you know when your luggage arrives. Okay, thank you. I'm just doing my job. Alex, what's wrong? Nothing. - Are you mad at me? - Why should I be mad at you? Well, I don't know, that's why I'm asking. Listen, some of us have to live in the real world. We cannot afford to believe in fairy tales as you do. What's that suppose to mean? I'm just saying sometimes things don't work out as you plan, and the slipper doesn't fit. That's mean. Yeah, well, the truth can hurt. Well, you know what? What do you know? You're just a- - A dog? Say it. Or was it a mouse? A jerk. Okay, Cinderella. And I better leave you before my car turns into a pumpkin. Well, it already drives like one. Huh, what's this? It's balsamic tomato spread. Absolutely delicious. Put it on all your bread and pastries. All right, thank you. So how was your weekend? Wonderful. Mmm. And then horrible. Oh. What's wrong with men? That's a really long list. Why don't you ask me what's right with them? I mean he was so sweet and nice the whole time and then out of nowhere it was Dr. Jekyll and Ms. Hyde. Alex, that doesn't sound like him. Well, I never wanna see him for as long as I live. Well, I don't think you're gonna have to because there is somebody waiting for you in your room. He arrived today. No. He found out I was here and tracked me down? Pretty much. Oh, my God, how do I look? Like you. The slipper doesn't fit, huh? Well, I show him how perfect my feet are. What? Just wish me luck. Good luck. You found me! Oh, you better believe I did. Daddy? Who were you expecting, hmm? The fairy godmother? You, uh, don't look like a man that's in love. How many times do I have to tell you there's nothing going on between Emma and I. She's in her world and I'm in mine. If I could just get back her suitcase she'd be out of my life for good. I mean if, uh, that's what you really want. That's exactly what I want. So it has arrived? Almost. It can't take so long to get here for Istanbul. Oh, look, it went through Uruguay, now it's going up through Africa. It's gonna take a couple of days. How is this possible? We have to be dealing with every incompetent baggage handler in existence. Pretty much. But hey, it's probably gonna get here by the time she has to head back. Ah. That can't come soon enough. So, uh, tell me about your parents, how did it go there? She drives everyone crazy. You think you know where you stand with her and then she's off in another direction. No sense of reality or other people's feelings. For someone who, uh, doesn't seem to care you sure seem to care a lot about here. No, , I'm done caring. Someone else turn now, no. Well, I guess it's, uh, good that her father showed up looking for her. What? Her father? But she said, "She has no family." Oh, she has a father all right, and a mean one at that. He came in, uh, looking for her this morning and, um, I told her, "She was at Diana's cafe." Are you sure he was her real dad Oh, I'm sure. His name is Howard Thorndyke. I looked him up this morning after he left the airport, he's a multimillionaire. Oh dear, mamma mia. Then that fantasy world of hers is not a lie. Will you eat something other than the bread and whatever that stuff is. I'm not hungry. Come on, Emma, you're acting like a kid. Because you're treating me like one. Okay, when we get back to the States everything will be better. Uh-uh, oh, no, I'm not going back with you. Huh? Don't you at least wanna see Jenny? I mean she misses you. I never wanna see that tattletale again. She didn't rat you out, okay? Let's be clear about that. I handle your cellphone bill, remember? Calls from Europe to America are readily apparent on the statement. Fine, I'll pay for my own cell bill then. I'm a working girl now. Look, I appreciate that you wanna stand on your own two feet. It's actually about time. However, no daughter of mine is gonna waste away at a coffee shop, all right? I didn't not send you to the best schools for you to work at a menial job. Yeah, but when Nick and I get married then I won't have to work here anymore. You know I could start my own business. - Oh, yeah? - Mm-hmm. Doing what? Whatever I want. You know I discovered this tomato farm just outside the city, and with the right management it could be huge. I already have ideas on how to help them expand their operations. What in God's green earth do you know about tomatoes? A lot actually. That is a pomodoro di pachino. It's probably come for the southeast coast of Sicily. And there's four varieties, ciliegino, costoluto, tondo liscio, and grappolo. Well, you got the lingo down. Who's been teaching you about tomatoes? Oh, just a guy I know. His parents are farmers. They've actually got this really neat place just near La Fattorietta. It's really lovely. So Nick's folks grow tomatoes. No, Alex, Alex's parents. Who's Alex? A guy. A different guy. Well, how many guys are you seeing, Emma? Jenny told me, "That you were in love" with this tennis player." Oh, I am, and I'm not leaving until I see him. Oh. Okay. So what's up? So I get notifications online for anything concerning Nick Milano. And it says here, "That he's back in town." Look, he's gonna be a the Sportsmen's Lodge tomorrow. You, you know that's clear across town. Oh, great, well, that's where I'll be then with Nick, and you can't stop me. I better go prepare for my big day. Okay, goodnight. I'm so sorry that I butted in. No, no, it doesn't matter. I mean once her mind's set there is no stopping her. Yeah, I know. She kinda reminds me of me at that age. Hmm. I've just lost my ability to communicate with her. You know if you just give her a little bit of time, I think she'll turn around. The food's good. Glad you like it. Wish I was hungry. She's already gone. Yeah, she got up bright and early this morning. She jumped in a cab, and she went to go surprise Nick at Sportsmen's Lodge. I suspected as much. Okay. Well, well, let me, uh, let me get a pastry. And I need a cup of the strongest coffee you got. Coming right up. Here you go. Oh, thank you. Do you, uh, mind if I join you? Well, sure, please do. Thank you. You know when I first met Emma, um, I thought she was actually running away from a bad relationship. I didn't realize that when she said Daddy she actually meant her real father. You've been very kind to her. And I owe you a debt of gratitude for taking her in, Ms. Jensen. Diana. And Emma is, she's really a sweet girl, and she really means well. I could, I could see right away. Mm-hmm, she has a great heart. She always seems to give it to the worst men. Actually that would be my ex-husband, he wins the worst man award hands down. You got any kids, Diana? No, I, I manged to avoid that mistake. Not a fan of children? Oh, no, I, I love children, it was just my male counterpart. Yeah, it worked out for the best. Well, I got lucky there. I found the most amazing woman but I lost her too soon. You know it was kind of hard raising a daughter by yourself. When, uh, Margaret got sick Emma was only 12, and then she passed. I like to think I've done my best. Thought I've been a good dad. I'm really sorry to hear that, Mr. Thorndyke. Oh, Howard. Howard. Right. I'm gonna need another one of these. Coming right up. Thank you. My love, you have found me. I've missed you so much. We should never be apart again. Emma Thorndyke, will you marry me? Yes! Yes! Yes? It's me from California. Oh, yes, of course, uh, Esther, right? No. Elizabeth? Emma. Emma Thorndyke. - Right. - Yoga goats. Right, Emma and the goats, uh. Nice to see you again. I was just in the middle of giving, uh, some personal lessons to a few of my favorite clients. Yes, wait your turn. Ladies, please, give me a moment. I flew all the way here to see you. I thought you were a professional tennis player. Competed at Wimbledon? You work in a country club? I said I'd been to Wimbledon, never said I competed there. And why are all your clients women? They appreciate what I have to offer. You should of told me you were coming to Italia. - I wanted to surprise you. - Well, you have. Where are you staying? Perhaps we can get together later for drinks. Well, I was hoping to stay with you. With me? I, uh, I do not think my wife would permit that. You're married? Oh, but you didn't tell me that. I also never told you I wasn't. I mean you weren't wearing a wedding ring. You're not, you're not wearing one now. Well, you know it's, uh, better for business if I don't. Women like to play these little fantasies in their minds about tennis instructor and the student. Would you like me to give you lesson while you're in town? I've learned enough. One pink suitcase for, uh, Ms. Emma Thorndyke. That's it, it's here. It is. I need you to sign here. Finally. It'd help if you didn't keep changing destinations. We always wanted it here in Rome, Italia. Well, we have requests to ship this suitcase to Iceland, Turkey, Uruguay, and then South Africa. Requests? From who? One, Russell Russo. Thanks, guys. What is he talking about? Um, look, it, it started like a little practical joke. A joke? Yeah, uh, first the airline screwed up and sent it over to Japan, and then I saw you getting involved with her, and you know finding her a place to live, and getting her food. And I thought it'd be funny if the bag took a bigger detour, you know. You used the word funny. I, I thought it was funny, but then my motivations changed when I saw that you started, you know liking her. You took her to your parents' farm. Uh, you took her out to dinner. And you guys, you know, you guys seemed to like each other, so you know, think of me as a mischievous cupid, you know. - Cupid. - Love. You got five seconds and I'm going to kill you. I'm taking my lunch break! Russell. Open the door. No. - I'm not doing anything look. - No. Don't look at the suitcase. Russell. Don't look at the suitcase. Did Emma have you try this spread last night? - Uh-uh. - Okay, you should. Really, this came from Alex's tomato farm. Uh-huh. Yeah. Hey. Not bad. Zesty. Mmhmm. But sweet. Emma may be on to somethin'. We could generate a demand for this back in the US. Yeah, kinda unique. You're back so soon. Did you find Nick? I did. And how'd it go? Nick is not who I thought he would be. Things between us are over. You know I'm mature enough to admit when I'm wrong and I was wrong. Mm-hmm. I'm moving on. Does that mean you're gonna be leaving us? And coming back with me. Oh, no, no, I'm gonna stay here in Rome, and I'm ready to work. You know I even learned how to say nice to meet you in Italian. Say what? Dad, you were right. I mean I've been acting like a child the whole time. It's about time I grow up. - Great. - And you know I can't do that while living with you in California. I have to stand on my own two feet starting here and now. Well, I mean it doesn't need to be like here. And it doesn't need be right now. Well, no, yes, it does. And you know what I'm ready to work like everyone else. And I'm determined to be the best coffee maker you've ever had, Ms. Jensen. Help. Yeah, look, Emma, I really appreciate the, uh, fresh attitude and, uh, the fact that, but you don't need to start your new life waiting on people. No, I do. I have to build myself up from the bottom. It's the only way I can be totally independent. Okay. Ms. Emma Thorndyke, on behalf of the lost and found department at Rome Airport, I wish to present your missing luggage. - Ah. - You can throw it out. I don't need it anymore. What? I'm starting fresh. No material things. Fine, it's your bag, go do with it what you will. My hands are clean. Oh, wait! Wait! Here take this. Here, take it. Emma, that is way too big a tip. No, Dad, just stay out of it, please. I told you I'd pay you back. I don't need your money. I don't need anything from you. - Can you- - Yeah, what? Okay. What is your problem? No more problems. I did my duty. You've got your suitcase, your money, your father, and I'm sure you will connect with your tennis player and live happily ever after. Well, Mr. Smart Guy, I'll have you know that my plans have changed. But even if they hadn't, why does my happiness make you so angry? I'm not angry. I'm just disappointed. About what? I thought you were Cinderella. No, I thought I was Cinderella, you thought I was nuts. Not nuts, I just believed you were this poor, lost girl alone, and in need of assistance, and I just tried to help. And you did. I just wanted to say thank you. I don't need your charity. But it's not charity, it's reimbursement for dinner, groceries, gas money. I have to go. You have your life and I have mine. What is that suppose to mean? Emma, listen to me very carefully, we come from two different worlds, and I just don't fit into yours. So was that Alex? Another jerk? No, he's great. I blew it. I think I'm ready to go home now. Good. I can get us on a flight first thing tomorrow. Okay. Hey, before we go, I wanna discuss this tomato business of yours some more. No, forget it, it was just silly idea. No, no, it wasn't a silly idea. I just tried the spread, it's got real potential. You really think so? You're not just saying it because it's me? No. You know me when it comes to investments I put personal matters aside, and this is a good one. My little financial genius. Don't try to cheer me up. It's a father's duty. Yes, okay. Hey. So I decided to quit my job at the airport. I think I'd be more useful here with you full-time. I can get rid of my place in town, save money there, and. Emma? Yes, where is Emma? I found her suitcase and she's fending for herself now. It's, uh, over. But she liked you, Alex, a lot. Yes, and you liked her. Don't deny it, we saw you two together. I don't wanna talk about Emma anymore. She was not who I thought she was. How so? I thought she was poor. Turns out she's rich. And you're going to hold that against her? She didn't lie to you. Remember she told us, "She was wealthy." I know, but I didn't believe her. And you're mad because she told you the truth. She, she also said, "That she felt like Cinderella." Huh, so what's wrong with that Alex? Most women want to be Cinderella. Yes, but Cinderella was poor, beaten down. She wasn't wealthy, upper class citizen. Si, she was. In the beginning Cinderella was just Ella, the daughter of a very wealthy family. Then her father remarried, but when he died, her stepmother and her sisters took over the estate and turned Ella to a Cinderella to be their servant girl. Are you sure the story was like that? Then the fairy godmother comes, and grants the wishes, uh, she goes to the ball, meets the prince. Si, Papa, I know the rest of the story, but I'm no prince. You are prince as far as we are concerned. And if she is smart, she'll see that too. I'm going to bed. And if you're smart, you'll make her see it. Yep, we'll get all the details worked out when I'm back in California. Yeah, get contracts drawn up immediately. Huh? Yeah, I am looking forward to partnering with you as well, Roberto. Ciao. Yeah, have a nice day, sir. And make sure to try the tomato spread, it is so delicious. Emma, we got like 10 minutes max if we're gonna make that flight. Yeah, yeah, I'm already packed. I just need like one more marocchino, What? She's really got the hang of this. Talented girl. Yeah. I've always know that. I can't believe I am gonna say this but I think I'm actually gonna miss here. Oh, guess what? I think I'm gonna miss you. Oh. Yeah, you're really the first woman I've been able to talk to in a long, long time. You know, Howard, I feel the same about you. I mean, you've actually restored my faith in men. Well, that's good. Hope we can get together again sometime soon. Well, you know where to find me. I do, and believe me, I'll be back for business and pleasure too. I look forward to that. Don't work too hard. Hey, time's a wasting, young lady. What are you both smiling about? Your father just got off the phone with Mr. Thorndyke. Your girlfriend came through with all of her promises. She talked to her father about our tomatoes and Martini's spread, and he wants to partner with us. You know she's willing to make a big investment. We are back in business! Yes! That's great, but as I told you, Emma's not my girlfriend so. Well, I guess that's for the best since she's leaving Italy at 11:45 on flight 490 with her father. Uh, they're going back to America. And what about Nick Milano, the guy she was in love with? Oh, yes, he lost that match. Yeah, her father said, "That she had fallen for someone" but, uh, then he rejected her." Who could be so foolish? She's so great. She's so smart. She's so young. She's so pretty. She's- I gotta go! Yes, you do! Go get her, Son! Run! Alex, run! Thanks, man. Grazie. Go on. Thank you. And you can check if Alex Malvesi is working here today? - Malvesi. - I'd like to say goodbye. Sure. He's not here. His name is not listed in the directory either. I believe he no longer works here. Oh, okay. Hey, uh, I'm sure I can get us on a later flight. No, no, no, let's just get on the plane. You got it. Okay. Here you are. Now look with the luggage, please make doubly certain it gets on the right plane. We had an issue coming out. All right, good. And is the gate on there? Good. Yeah. We go to the lounge, good? - Have a nice day. - Thank you. Hello. Yeah, Russell, I need two favors from you right now. You owe me. Make it happen. Sure, yeah. Go. Will Ms. Emma Thorndyke, please make her way to the lost and found desk. There is a lost item that needs immediate identification. What? You gotta be kidding? Excuse me. What again? A young man has misplaced his heart and believes that Emma Thorndyke is currently in possession of it! We have it on good authority- Come on. That Ms. Thorndyke may have in deed stolen his heart. Come on! Not that he needs it back. He just wants to make sure he lost it. Come back in lost in found with all my heart safe and sound because he, because you love her. You know you could have just called me directly, you've got my number. Yes, but where's the fun in that. I've behaved like an idiot. So it takes an idiotic gesture like this to hopefully set things right. Don't you know being in love means you never have to say you're an idiot. She's got a point. I'm really sorry it took me so long to come to my senses. I'm sorry for the way I treated you. And you were right I was caught up in a fairy tale, and I couldn't see that Mr. Right was in front of me the whole time. Speaking of fairy tales there is one last thing. You left this behind when you stayed at my parents' house. Did I really? No, I actually had Russell grab your suitcase from the plane and pull it out. Grazie. Wow, how fitting. I was lost until I found you. We found each other. I don't know how to thank you enough, Howard. He's cute. My best first man here, Russell wanted to meet your friend. Oh, this is Jenny. Jenny's in PR. - Hello. - Hello, Jenny. So, uh, are all your relationships, uh, public or do you some private ones as well. Well, that depends on the clientele. Anyway we're practically family now. And perhaps there's gonna be a wedding very soon or two. Oh, um, we're just taking it one day at a time. Yeah, but, uh, taking a place around the corner from the Ristretto E Corretto is a pretty big first step. No regrets? Oh, no. Very sweet. So what do you do, Russell? Oh, I'm like the wizard of Italy, I'll make your dreams come true. Oh, tell me more. Oh, oh, I love you, Mr. Malvesi. And I love you Ms. Thorndyke soon to be Mrs. Thorndyke-Malvesi or Malvesi-Thorndyke. Or should I take your last name? We'll, figure it out. Salute!
