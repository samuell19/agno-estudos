(gentle chiming) (mysterious music) - Where are we? (Nikolai sighs) - Yugoslavia. (Nikolai breathing heavily) Get ready. (Nikolai chuckles) Hey, comrade. (soldier speaks in foreign language) We're dying of thirst over here. I'd appreciate if you give us some water. (Nikolai panting) (gun thuds) (gun firing) (siren wailing) (guns firing) (soldiers groaning) - Now's our chance! - Oh, god. - Go, go! - Move it! - Come on! - Get in the water! (soldiers yelling) - [Soldier] Move it, move it! (lively drumming) (explosion booms) (dog barking) (people chattering) - [Charles] Gentlemen, please. I think what they're asking is quite clear. - General, we lost 54 planes in the Ploiesti raid. That's 54 out of 178. We're still hurting and they want a second raid? I don't believe this! - It's impossible, General. Some idiot back in Washington is out of his mind. - Now, let's drop the negatives and start talking about what we can do. Unless, of course, you'd rather resign your commissions and clean latrines. - When's the strike, then, sir? - Ask him. - The beginning of June. - Major Ted Keegan, intelligence. - This is Captain Clark, known as Major Nestorovic, undercover intelligence, code contact 112. - Major Keegan is the idiot from Washington that you were talking about. In fact, he's in charge of the whole operation, Wild Wind. (curtain rattles) - Coffee is here, sir. - Fine. Have some coffee. It'll soothe your nerves. - I need a quart of Scotch for that, General. - [Charles] What overall operation are we talking about, sir? - We need a second raid on Ploiesti as a distraction. It's not as bad as it sounds, General. - Major, I don't quite understand your connection with all of this. But don't tell me that another raid over Ploiesti won't be as bad as it sounds. - The Major's connection to all this is direct orders from General Marshall at the Pentagon, understand? - When I said "distraction," I meant it, not an actual raid but the appearance of one. You send up the 89th, the 93rd, the 389th, and you point them toward Ploiesti, but you don't go in. - Don't go in? - If the Germans think we're hitting Ploiesti again, they'll strip their defenses for 50 miles around, and they'll rush them into Ploiesti. Hopefully, they'll pull them out of here too, the Zlodol pass. - What's this Zlodol pass? - Zlodol is the pass to the Balkans. - The key to the invasion of Sicily. The landings will take place the first week in June. The kind of opposition we find is gonna be determined right here. Why? Because the German reinforcements against the invasion will have to come through here, through the pass. - I don't get it. Why wouldn't the krauts send reinforcement directly south out of Germany? - Because they don't have them. - The only Wehrmacht we serve that's available are in the Balkans. The minute we land in Sicily, they'll be pouring through the pass. - Who's going to stop them? - Yugoslav partisans, and a lot of luck. - Well, there's a bridge at the pass. Now, if they destroy it, they could hold up 30 to 40 divisions. - And if they're held up long enough, we've got Sicily. - Zlodol, that seems pretty important for something you can't even pronounce. - Well, you can just call it Bad Man's Pass, fellas. That's what it is. - You have to excuse the captain. He's with the rangers. Besides, he won't be here for long. General, if the weather is right, I'd like drop him and Captain Wayne into the Zlodol area tonight. - Tonight? - Yes, sir. General, we need a place where we can talk. - Major, we're all on the same side. You can talk right here. - No, sir, I can't. - In there. Anything else? - Yes, the bottle of Scotch that General Springer was talking about. Babovic, a tough partisan leader, he runs the partisan show in the Zlodol mountains. Now, you'll be stationed in the river mill. - I understand. The partisan bellman will take me to the mill when I land. - Major Nestorovic, he's wearing a mercenary uniform as if he's fighting for the Krauts, but he isn't. - Yeah, he's a good guy, an American working undercover. Christ, I don't need a briefing, I need a scorecard. - Yeah, well, that's what worries me. - All right, let's go through this one more time, okay? - Nikolai, Russian officer, a demolition expert, probably has the same idea to blow up the Zlodol Bridge. If he's alive, he should be with Babovic and the partisans. - Yeah, the Krauts are paying a lot of money for him or Babovic. Nazi Captain Muller, in charge of all railroad and communications in the area. A ruthless, psychopath killer. (gun fires) I suggest to try to avoid him, if possible. (gun fires) - The worst is I goof and we lose the war. - Well, that is war, Captain. - Have another drink. - Thanks. - [Charles] Excuse me. - [Ted] General. - I have B-24 on the runway warmed up and ready to go. - One for the road, General. - All right. For your good luck. (speaks in foreign language) (glasses clinking) (glasses clinking) - Amen. (glasses clinking) - Cheers. (lively music) (siren wailing) (guns firing) (Nikolai panting) (train rumbling) (horn whistling) (bell tolling) - [Bounty Hunter] Come on! The train is coming. Get off the tracks! Come on! Come on, get off the tracks. - Okay, I'm moving. - Come on! (man grunting) - Well, I wonder who do they think we are, Lieutenant Obad. - Excuse me, sir, an urgent cable for you. - Thank you. Well, it seems like Babovic and his partisans are moving into the area. You better put the guards on 24-hour duty. Where's the telephone? - Over there. - Who's in command? - Mr. Hovich, but he's not here right now, sir. - Where is he? - He was sent to Belgrade. - Who's second-in-command? - Mr. Vucovich. - Where is he? - Yesterday, he was killed by partisans. - What? Has anyone notified headquarters? - I don't know. I'm just the station manager. The partisans have blocked all the tracks and you are the first train to get through, sir. I hope you understand- - Better see what's going on around here. Everything is in utter chaos. (woman speaks in foreign language) Hello. May I speak to Colonel Kirschte, please? (woman speaks in foreign language) - [Kirschte] Heil Hitler. This is Colonel Kirschte. - This is Major Nestorovic, Colonel. - Yes, Major. - I'm the commander of the armored train, number three. - I see. - We just ran into Pavlich, in Zlodol. - [Kirschte] You're in Zlodol pass? - Right. - Congratulations, Major. - Well, thank you, sir. By the way, the man in charge here in Zlodol, he was killed by partisans yesterday. - [Kirschte] Yes, you must take the offensive. They're very active in that area. - Well, we'll certainly comb the area, sir. - Very good. - Right. There were two prisoners brought in this morning, man and a woman. - [Kirschte] What is their story? Do you suspect they're partisans? - Yes, they seem suspect. They wouldn't answer... Well, they just wouldn't answer questions. - [Kirschte] It could be the escaped Russians. - We'll send them right over to you. - [Kirschte] Yes, stay in your present location until I get back to you. - We'll hold position until we hear from you. - [Kirschte] Excellent, Major. - Right. - Where the hell are we? - Zlodol. - What a filthy, stinking place. Dirty peasants, they live like pigs here. (bounty hunter humming) (liquid dripping) - [Man] Reward! Reward! (gentle drumming) Order of the German High Command. Reward for partisans, Russians, and Americans. (gentle drumming) - Hey, let me see that. "Executed." (wheels rattling) Hey, who killed him? - He was a partisan. The German patrol shot him. - What did he do? Who was he? - He was a switchman. He tried to sabotage the bridge. - [Bounty Hunter] There's going to be a lot of partisan widows here. Everyone, look, that's the way they'll all end. - Hold it. Obad. - Yes, Major. - Bring the prisoners over. - [Obad] Sir. Open it up. Come on, come on. Let's go. (Nikolai groans) Get down, you scum! Let's go! (Obad grunting) (Obad grunting) - Tie them up. Get them to Colonel Kirschte in Belgrade. - Take it away! (handle squeaking) - W1. W2, do you read me? - What do you have? - I'm sending two Russian prisoners your way. They're most important. - I understand. - [Clark] I'm counting on you. (handset clacks) (dramatic music) (gun firing) - Where to? - [Soldier] Belgrade. - [Okati] Who's this? - I don't know. The orders are to take them. Might be Russians. - It's not your problem anymore. Get on! Run! (gun clacks) Run because now you're running for your lives. (gun firing) (gentle music) (engine whirring) (horse whinnies) - You there! Anna can't go much further without rest. - It's not safe here. No sense in getting killed. (horse whinnies) (gentle music) - Mile. I think we'll be safe here, for a while. - What do you think? - Looks all right. All of us can use some rest. - Not too long. (Okati laughs) (gun fires) Dammit! (gun clacking) Up there in the rock! (gun fires) Get down! Everyone, get down! (gun fires) (Anna gasping) Come on, quickly, take cover. Here. Do you see him? Let's go. Move out, this way. - Don't panic. - Idiot, do you want to die? - We stay here. Come out, you- (gun thuds) (Nikolai groans) (Okati grunts) - Do you want us all to get killed out here now? (singers humming) You, over here. Give me a hand. (Nikolai groaning) I'm taking him to Babovic. - [Partisan] Go in. - Who are you? - Who wants to know? (Babovic chuckles) - I'm a partisan. My name is Babovic. - What kind of partisan? Leaving your dead in the fields... - Who are you? - I'm Russian. Nikolai Walser. I'm a demolitions expert who knows his job very well. (guns firing) We turned the tide of the war on the Russian front by crushing the German divisions. I was in Kolsch when General Goderich started the offensive citadel. (explosion booms) They threw everything they had against us, including their new Tiger and Panzer tanks. These monsters were their last hope. (cannon fires) (explosion booms) The fighting was brutal. (cannon fires) (explosion booms) (cannon fires) (explosion booms) We were losing 100,000 men a week. (cannon fires) (explosion booms) The white Russian snow was drenched in blood. Many, many dead. But the days of the Nazis were numbered. (explosions booming) (guns firing) (explosions booming) (guns firing) (explosions booming) We stopped them. We finally stopped them. - We could use your help if you'd like to join us. (Babovic sighs) We are fighting tanks with horses and muskets. We're low on ammunition and medical supplies. I barely have food to feed my men. And yet despite all that, we must succeed. We simply cannot afford to fail. It's up to you. You decide. (gentle music) The bridge is the key. I need every experienced man I can get my hands on. I'm glad you'll be with us. - Everybody has to pitch in. The soldiers on the train need food. If you're good with a rifle, the Germans are paying a big reward for dead soldiers. They're paying good money. It's like hunting. 2,000 dinars per dead partisan, Russian, or American. What's up? - Come on, you owe me some money. All right, you, my dough. - What for? - [Bounty Hunter] Feast your eyes. - A girl? - And a man. (drawer clatters) - Half price for the woman. That's the best I can do for now. - Brother. You're loaded. Where'd you get all that loot? - I earned it. Hunting is very profitable these days. You should try it, if you're sober. (bounty hunter chuckles) - Father. Father. Where'd he get all the money? Maybe he's been working for the Nazis. - He's different than you are. (bounty hunter humming) (bounty hunter whistling) (bounty hunter sighs) - Here. (bounty hunter whistling) (bounty hunter whistling) (bounty hunter humming) Now, where is he going? - Ask Bela. She's the only one that knows what's really going on. - He's warming the bed of the switchman's widow. Now I know why her herbs are called potent. - [Okati] I'll be out here. (gentle music) - They're going to have a meeting tonight in the village. The major of the train will be there talking about the partisans. Now, my contact told me that most of the mercenaries will be there. There will be a lot of guards posted near the train. - And what time will that be? - Well, the meeting is scheduled for five o'clock. By that time, they'll probably all be drunk. - Uh-huh. Let's go. It's set. We attack this a- - Like that? No preparation? - That's the way it is here, friend. We have to be ready when the opportunity comes. We don't have the luxury of preparation and planning. Okati, let's move out. - I'll get all the men ready. (gentle music) (singers humming) (gun firing) (gun firing) (explosions booming) (guns firing) (bell tolling) - Come on! On the train! After them! Quickly! (whistle shrilling) Come on! After them! (steam hissing) (train rumbling) (explosion booms) Fire! (cannon fires) (explosions booming) (guns firing) Fire! (cannon fires) (explosion booms) (guns firing) (cannon firing) (explosions booming) - What do you think? - God, it's a horrible mess. - What do we do next, Commandant? - We'll regroup back at the camp. - What about the train? - The train's not a tank. It can't leave the tracks. Okati, you stay and cover our retreat. - We'll take this. And this too also. Now, come on, cheer up. I've got everything. Here are your herbs. Come on, now. What's the matter with you? - Oh, Kosta, I'm sorry. It's not fair, bringing all my problems to your house. - You must come along. My family always does what I say. - I don't want to be trouble. My husband was a partisan. The Germans killed him. - I know, but it's over. Let's go. (horn whistles) (train rumbling) Dammit. Mercenary bastards. (gentle music) (Kosta sighs) - [Nata] I'm afraid I'm going to divide your family. To the village, I'm a partisan widow. - The whole country is divided. Don't worry so much about it. It'll be all right. - I can't help it, I'm still worried. - Now, stop it. Let's go. Hyah. (tense music) - Major, mission accomplished. We really taught them a lesson, sir. - Good work, Lieutenant. You will go to the village and keep your ears open. - [Obad] Yes, sir. I'll handle it. - Lieutenant. Partisan group headed by Vuk Babovic attacked our unit in this area, and we had a few casualties, but we cut them to pieces. Should take them months to regroup. - Excellent, Major. You really did a marvelous job. Send the radio cable a field command. We'll wait here for our orders. You deserve a drink, how about it? (gentle music) - [Man] And where is Kosta? - [Mitar] I don't know. - [Man] Where's the boss? - [Bounty Hunter] Who do you think I am? - Kosta's in the woods picking flowers with the widow, or so he said. - All right. It's agreed. The lieutenant will be staying here. Make sure he has everything he needs. Damn partisans. We'll get the bastards. No way they can win here. - Where are we going to put him? Mitar is sick. - He'll use the guestroom. - And your father? - Out in the barn, there will be plenty of room. (door slams) What are you waiting for? Show him the way. (gentle music) - [Mitar] Look at our father, 60 years old, like a bull in new pasture. (Mitar laughs) - She's our guest. What are you staring at? (gentle music) (gentle music) - That partisan cow. With her around, we'll lose everything. (hands thudding) - When the Germans find this partisan, they'll take everything from us, dear. Damn her. - I'm tired of this. You're drunk, Mitar. - That bitch. - Hey. What is this? - That's all that we have for now. - Well, you better come up with more next week. - Flour. Corn. Wheat. Well... The soldiers won't be happy with what you have brought! We all have to pitch in as much as we can! - [Schofield] Train was unsuccessful. - Stand by, Captain. Sir, the captain rang for you. - Go ahead, Captain. - The attack on the train was unsuccessful. Heavy casualty. (gun clacking) - Can you hear me, clearly? You have to get that bridge. Captain, you have got to get that bridge. - We will try to intercept train at Zlodol pass. (guns firing) (window crashes) (guns firing) (soldier groans) (gun clacking) (gun firing) - [Soldier] Remember, the order is to take him alive. The German wants to question him. (gun clacks) (guns firing) (gun clacks) (guns firing) - [Soldier] Hands up. Don't move. Take him away. Blow up this tower. (explosion booms) - [Man] 30, 40, 50. 10,000 plus 5,000 bonus because he was an American. - [Bounty Hunter] That's good. (gentle music) - You're leaving? - I'm going into Zlodol. I'll be back in a while. - Take this. Use it for tea. You'll see that it works very well. I'm sorry I haven't been by to see your sister. I'll try to come by tonight. How is she? Is she better? Is the fever down? (gentle music) - Here. Take it. You have to help my husband. Please. He hasn't made love to me since all this killing started. He's impotent. - Mm-mm. I'm sorry, I can't. - Please. You can. Everyone talks about how great you are. They say that you have the power to cure anything with your herbs. - He is cursed by his conscience. - I see. - Tell him to stop killing his own people for money, then he'll come back to your bed. (gentle music) - Is this the way it's going to be? Your husband is probably happier dead, you partisan bitch. (door thuds) (Mitar belches) - Not bad. - It sure beats milk, huh? I'll get another bottle. - Hey, Goldilocks. Stop and smell the roses. - I can smell them from here. - Why are you always running away from me? The mayor said you can take care of my needs. - You've got the best room in the house. - But is too big just for me. You know, I could be a good friend to you, but you don't seem to like soldiers. Maybe you prefer the partisans, like your father. (horse trotting) - Lieutenant, sir. Our patrol just captured an American. - When? - This morning. We just took him prisoner. - [Obad] Damn! Don't forget where we left off. - Now, here in Ploiesti is the only fuel depot between the Russian border and where we are. - If we lose that, we lose the war. American pilots are bombing Ploiesti every day. (airplanes whirring) (bombs screeching) (explosion booms) (bombs screeching) (explosions booming) Those that are still alive cannot leave through that passage. (lively drumming) (gentle music) (hands thudding) - Please, let me in. - [Woman] Go away. Leave us alone. You are nothing but trouble. - Why? (somber music) - She looks better leaving than coming. I'm glad she's taking her trouble somewhere else. They would have crucified us because of her. - Hey, where did she go? - She pulled out. (door clacks) Kosta, I have to talk to you. - So, what do you want? Kick me out? - Hm. What was so fascinating about that woman? I don't think she was so hot. I will do anything to make you forget her. - What are you saying? - Your son, you know, he's impotent. Understand? It's not fair to me. I need a man's love. And you need a woman. Oh, Kosta, please, take me. I know that you're thinking of her. - You're crazy. Leave me. (bounty hunter humming) - Please, it wasn't my fault. (woman screaming) Oh, no. No! Oh! You're hurting me! - [Bounty Hunter] What?! Does this excite you?! Get up, you whore! Get up! - [Woman] Oh! (gentle music) (bounty hunter panting) - [Bounty Hunter] Oh, shit. Now where did he go? - When we're in the hills, you can help to take care of the wounded, and I'll do my best to take care of the horses. I'm sure we'll be more than welcomed. Hyah. (hand slaps) - Not very pretty. And it's gonna get worse. Much worse! - Sorry, Colonel, I have no idea what you're talking about. Wish I could help you, Colonel, but I'm just a tourist taking in the countryside, that's all. - Yes, of course. An American with a two-way radio caught in the middle of partisan country in the middle of a war! - Coincidence. (punch thuds) (lively drumming) - I'm gonna ask you one more time. Who are your partisan contacts? Who do you report to? What are your orders?! You don't take me very serious, do you, my friend? But you should. War comes down to a strength of wills, and I don't intend to fail! Hilda! - Ja, Captain Muller. - Bring me the partisan girl. (Hilda speaks in foreign language) Do you know this woman? - Never seen her before in my life. - I expect you're telling me the truth. She's a local woman with no known partisan connections. She doesn't deserve to die or to be punished, does she? Don't you agree?! Is she a partisan contact? Is she a partisan contact?! - [Schofield] No! (lively drumming) (gun clacks) (gun fires) (gun fires) - Hilda. Button your shirt. - Ja, Captain. - I'm gonna bring them in one by one, every human being in this village, and I'm gonna shoot them one by one until this room is full of bodies, unless you talk now. (Schofield screaming) (singers humming) - Kosta. Good to see you. Came to join us or you're lost? - I'm not lost. I've come to join. - Good to have you. - I brought a friend with me. She's a good nurse. And I can help. - Let's go to the commandant. - [Naum] Hey, go on. - [Babovic] Why are you here? - I came to help, to throw the Nazis out. I'll give my life to help you. People are saying good things about you, and so we are here. My friend over there is a good nurse. She can help take care of your soldiers. - Garbage. You must think that we're stupid. So, tell us who sent you. - My conscience, son. All of your men here know about me. Go ask them, they'll tell you. - He's my friend. He's a good man. - Well? - Sounds good to me, Naum. Glad to have you with us. - [Nikolai] Men, the only way to stop an armored vehicle is with a cannon, a land mine, or a hand grenade. We have but one cannon, but we have many, many men, many grenades. You hold the grenade such, pull the pin, 10 seconds, and you're in business. (gentle music) - So, do you have some information for me now? (Obad sighs) I think you're holding out on me. You'd better cooperate. Quit stalling. When do they plan to attack, huh? Come on, like before. - You mean now? - Why not? (Obad chuckles) - Zlodol is in direct passage to Ploiesti, the only way the German armies can travel. - Babovic and his partisans must not leave this area. - [Clark] Now, this area is controlled by our Panzer division, and the road, the road that leads to that bridge will be held at all cost. (tanks rumbling) - Fire! (cannon fires) (explosion booms) (guns firing) (explosion booms) (explosions booming) (cannon fires) (explosion booms) (lips smacking) - [Muller] Berlin needs results. If you can't deliver, Himmler has ordered that you be executed. (lively drumming) (gentle music) - Looks like your father is away for a while. (dog barking) (chickens clucking) - He's in the mountains. We have lots of beehives there. - When is he coming back? - I really can't tell. - They have quite a sting, huh? He should be careful of those bees. - We have to get Father back. - Why don't you send Mitar after him, huh? - [Man] Stay! (horse whinnies) (dog barking) (chickens clucking) - Mr. Naum! Don't you remember me? I'm Mitar, Mitar Sekulic. - Ah, all right. You must be here to see your father. Okay, let's go. - Dad, I'm glad to see you. - Glad to see you. What is it? (gentle music) - We have to talk. - Mm. Now, tell me, what's the matter? - Father, you have to come home with me. Otherwise, the Germans or their mercenaries will kill us all. You have to. - Not this time, son. We are here to stay. - [Naum] Mitar, Commander Babovic wants to see you. - What's your name? - Mitar Sekulic, from Zlodol. I'm a farmer, a peasant. I'm here to see my dad. - I see. Okati, so what do you think, huh? - I don't buy it, sir. - Really, it's the truth! I don't even know how to fire a gun. Ask my father, I'm a sick man. (Mitar coughing) - What do you say, Kosta? - It is true, he's not involved. - You see? I'm not involved. I'm your friend. - So, what's your opinion? - Why do you ask me? In Russia, we tore traitors to pieces. This is your country, your problems. You decide what to do. - You're just too soft. - You're too quick. - Okay, we'll check you out. You'll stay here for now. (Mitar coughing) (dog barking) - Naum, I have to pee. - [Naum] All right. Come this way. (door creaks) (dramatic music) (rock thuds) (Naum groans) (dog barking) (gun clacks) (gun firing) (Mitar groans) (gentle music) (man speaks in foreign language) - I'm sorry to have to tell you, Mitar was killed by the partisans. (Bela gasps) (Bela screaming) (Bela sobbing) (gun clacks) - What now? - I will get them. - Oh, god. - This can't wait. (gentle music) (dog barking) (Kosta humming) - Would you shut up, you old fart? (Kosta humming) - Leave him alone. - He's driving me crazy. It was not my fault. I had no choice but to kill him. - Maybe you did, and maybe you didn't. - So you would have let him escape, then? See? You're soft. - "Soft." "Soft." Mile, do you know what's the most important thing in war? - The bullet. - Mm. The mind. - Well, you use your mind and I'll use my gun, and we'll see who's gonna live longer. (Okati laughs) - We'll see. Those who shoot without thinking die fast. - Meaning me? - Yes, you. You like the taste of blood. - Yeah. That's why they call me The Wolf. - So you're a wolf? I think it is werewolf. - Fall in, everyone. Tomorrow, there is a fair in Zlodol. Many officers of the mercenary army will be there. We will hit them hard. I'm putting Okati in charge. - Thank you, sir. You heard what our commandant said. Now, let's go cut them to ribbons! - Death to the fascists! (men shouting in foreign language) - For the last time, where are the partisans? What are their plans?! (Schofield groaning) Now, listen! Drums! (gentle drumming) Get up. Get up! This man is an American spy. Because of his collaboration with the partisans, this traitor is to be hanged. Signed General Friedrich, commandant, Belgrade. Huh. Say your last words, (speaks in foreign language). - You bastard. I'm not the only one. (Obad grunts) (Schofield groans) - Obad, who gave the order? - Headquarters decided, sir. You are to sign, Major, sir. - Is this some kind of a joke? - What's it matter? Right, sir? (lively music) (spoon clinking) Silence, silence! - Thank you, my Serbian brothers. I want to thank you for coming here today during this very special holiday. Today, we are all united as one big family. We are united in strength to save our country. Today, we have many soldiers. We have an army. Those devils, those communists, will not attack us. They will only kill our innocent people. (guns firing) (Clark groans) - [Man] Get out. Run, run! - Get back, all of you! Come on! I want to talk to these bastards for a minute. - Mile! Mile, don't you recognize me?! - Yes, and you disgust me. And you, what are you doing in that uniform? - They forced me. I didn't want to go. Come on, you know me, we were friends. - They forced you? I suppose that they forced all of you, huh? You're all mercenaries, and now you're gonna be paid. - Are you mad?! You can't take the law in your own hands! - Whose side are you on? Move! I'll shoot you too. - Babovic put you in charge of this operation, but he'll never approve this slaughter. - You heard him. - You're becoming more of an animal than them. - So you do what you want. - Wait. Here. Go. - [Soldier] Go on in. He's waiting for you. (gentle music) - Leaving? - I'm going to Zlodol pass. They shot the major. - He's dead? - I'm not sure, but I'm in charge. To the train. (gentle music) - Hey! (Kosta yells in foreign language) Where are you taking all these boys?! There'll be no one around to work in the fields! - What he says makes sense. - The way I see it, they learned their lesson. Let them go home. The people can't starve. - All right. You have learned your lesson. This time, you're lucky. You can go, but stay away from Nazis. - Hey! Old man, who let them go? - We decided to send them home. Look at them, they are only young school boys. - You idiots. (gun clacks) (gun firing) - [Babovic] We're about to fight the most important battle in this area. We have to put Zlodol pass out of commission for the Germans. But victory cannot be achieved without discipline. Those who disobey orders have to be dealt with. If we are brutal and merciless, we'll lose the support of our own people. Now, what's the verdict for Okati? - Hang him. - If you want me to second the motion, I say shoot him. - Wait a minute! Let's hear all the facts. Naum and I are guilty also. If we hadn't just let them go, Okati wouldn't have gone berserk. We also disobeyed- - Kosta is telling the truth. - You made the right decision. - Listen, Nikolai has fought on all fronts, why not ask for his advice, men? - Tomorrow, we hit the bridge. It'll be very tough. We will need every man we can get. Mile is brutal but effective. I say give him one more chance. That's my advice to you. - [Babovic] All right. One more chance. Dismissed. All right. We'll put the cannon here. (gentle music) - Come on! - I can't. I'll pray for you, my dear. - Why not? - I'm pregnant. (dog barking) (gentle music) - [Babovic] Corporal, check with our contact at the station. - [Corporal] Yes, sir. - Did you get through to him? Huh? - What's going on? - Not sure. - [Babovic] Keep trying. (device whirring) (bell tolling) (dramatic music) (train rumbling) - Get ready. The train just left. Now, it's up to you men. - They have just pulled out. - Tell Babovic I'm okay. The diversion with the blanks worked perfect. - The cannon will not be on time. - We use grenades. (handset clacks) (gentle music) - [Okati] Yes? - Mile, we don't have the cannon. It's up to you. The bridge has to go down. - Marco, come down with your dynamite! We'll need something more than just hand grenades! (train rumbling) (gentle music) (train rumbling) (train rumbling) (horn whistling) (train rumbling) (steam hissing) (tense music) (gun firing) (explosions booming) (brakes squealing) (guns firing) What are you waiting for? Get that machine gun! (explosion booms) (guns firing) (explosions booming) (guns firing) - [Muller] Give me your shirt. Dammit. What the hell went wrong? I hope these pigs recognize the Geneva Convention. These red partisan bastards. (partisans cheering) - Nikolai, take the German. And get those code books. - Okay. See you at the station. (partisans cheering) - Okay, we're moving out! Everybody, get on the train now! We'll celebrate when we get back to Zlodol! Come on! (gentle music) (horn wailing) - Major Keegan, Wild Wind 2 reporting. Mission accomplished. - General, the boys have done it. - Outstanding. - [Nikolai] Okay, I want to hear Radio Moscow. Turn it on, now. (static squealing) (static crackling) (choir singing in foreign language) (man speaks in foreign language) - Move, you. Hey, keep your eye on him. He almost got away. - [Partisan] Get out. Get out. Come on. All of you, move. - The killer. It's him! He's the murderer! - I had nothing to do with it! (gun firing) I'm innocent! - I had to. Look here, he attacked us in the hills. They were all traitors. (gentle music) What's wrong? What are you staring at? (hand slaps) - We've given this man a fair warning, and yet his atrocities continue! That's it! (gun clacks) - No, don't- (gun firing) (Okati groans) - Today, men, we have won a great victory, and you are all to be congratulated. But we still haven't won the war. To win, we'll need discipline. Yes, discipline! And sacrifices. My friend, are you staying? - What do you mean? - If you have to go back, you'll need an escort to the Black Sea. My men have made that crossing hundreds of times. - Why? (Nikolai sighs) I think I'd like to stay now. I know I can help, if you'd like. I'm fighting for Russia here. Hm? - Good. Glad you're with us. (train rumbling) - Good luck, fellas.
