Time in the alley feels like a lifetime. It's where my ritual begins. Think through my run, what it needs to look like, how it needs to feel. Get Power and I in sync. Connect. Some riders cut out all the noise in the arena, hearing only their own breath and the breath of their horse. Me? I hear everything. And now, coming for the national Little Britches finals, this young lady is already standing near the top in the first round in all the categories. On her way to legend status, Amberley Snyder. We got this, bubba. You gotta blast out of the alley, pick up as much speed as possible before you cross the eye. Hustle! Hustle! Standard barrel pattern. Sixty feet to the first barrel. That's the money barrel. You gotta be quick, smooth. Ninety feet to the second barrel. Crowd cheers me on. A hundred and five to the third. Come on! Faster! Dig in for that last sprint, the run home. You, your horse giving everything. Your legs encouraging his legs. Go, baby! Woo! Faster! Harder! This is it! Cross that eye. That time decides who take it, a saddle, a buckle, or a long drive home. Nothing but failure on your mind. And that run will cinch it. No one can catch her now. We now have a new Little Britches All-Around Champion, Amberley Snyder. Yes, baby! Woo! That's my girl! That's a time of 17.5 seconds, just one-tenth off her personal best. Good job, baby! One-tenth! I should have pushed him harder. Am, you won! You pulled a check. Should have been faster on that second barrel. Am! Mom, I'm not fast enough if I'm gonna go pro. I know, but can we just enjoy this for a minute, for one minute? Now, go pick up your saddle and congratulate Autumn. Your sister won the all-around too. Am, I won! Yeah! Get over here, you little winner! Can I put Power up? - You earned it. - Yes! - Yeah, Am, nice! - Yeah! Get there! - Nice! - Come on! Nice! Let's go, Am! Keep going! - There we go! - Yeah! - Come on! Bring it home! - Keep going! - There you go! Yeah! - Yeah! You got it. Nice, Am! There we go! 17.4! These are great times, Am. He is so fast. Yeah, we can shave some off of that. Gotta make him pay attention. Tell him where to go. Not my first time. Gotta get him snappier on the backside. - Use those legs. - Got it, Mom. Good boy! You sure you can leave him? Mom! You two are working so well together. Thank you. Just let it go. Mamacita, it's two weeks working retail at the National Western Stock Show. I need that money for my pro permit. Hey, you really tightened the pocket on that last barrel. You can stay on that when you get back. All right. Remember, I'm counting on you. We have our leadership conference coming up. This is important. Future Farmers of America is... Amberley, the world can revolve without you. For two weeks anyways. - Emmy, this is our ticket to scholarships. - Scholarships. I know. Utah South. Speaking of, are you still going? I mean, do I need to look for a new roommate? I can rodeo and go to school. You're hardly home as it is. You missed all your sister's rodeos, every one of your brother's ballgames. - True. - Yeah, why am I watching you, and you don't repay the favor? I pitched a three-hitter last week. What? No, you didn't. You wouldn't know that, now would you? Well, did you? Busted! Am, please take my truck. This old F-150 can get super squirrely. What? I love my truck! I've been driving it all over Utah. Well, that doesn't make me like it. How about if I drive you to Denver, and then I'll take a plane back? I'm driving. That's it. Mama... 'cita... you've had me at this my whole life. I could ride a horse before I could walk. If we play this right, we have a real shot at Rookie of the Year. I could even make a run at The American. You know that. What I know is I can't stop you. Mm-hmm. It's Daddy. Hi! - How's Hawaii? - Fine. Yeah, how's the team doing? Getting there. Can't go out there and hit the ball for them. Yeah, managing is different than playing, huh? Ah, got that right. Riding Power one more time before you go? You know it. - Miss me? - Hey. You know I've got you in my heart. And I'll be home next month. I know. Love you. Back at ya. Now, what's our rule? Hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard. That's my girl. Hey, why don't you let me brush Power, and I'll put him away, and then you can hit the road? No, we got riding to do. Okay. Well... text me when you stop for gas. Text me when you stop for food. I want you to call me when you get to the hotel obviously. - Call me in the morning when you wake up. - 'Cita, chill. I know. It's just my baby girl has grown up, and... Mama Bear can't handle it. Love you. Come on, Power. You and me. GPS signal lost. No! Help! Help! He... Oh, my god! Call 911. We're on I-80 east of Rawlins. Look, you gotta get here fast. What happened? I rolled my truck. I got thrown. Maybe I should try to get up. No, don't move. Uh... Uh... Hey, find my gray suitcase. My arm is tired. I need to lean on it. I'll be right back. There's a blue blanket in my front seat. - Can you grab it? - Sure. Easy. I'll get it. Easy. There you go. - Thank you. - You're welcome. I need your phone. Uh... Uh, it's in the car. Jade, bring your phone. Hey, is this your phone? - Thanks. - It's hot. Watch the wire. Okay. All right, miss, my name is Officer Brad Shervick. You've been in an accident, okay? What city do you live in? Elk Ridge, Utah. What are your parents' names? Tina and Cory Snyder. My mom's phone number is 801-724... Okay, you're alert. That's good. You got a pretty good cut on your forehead. Come here. Hold still. Yeah, I do. I need to call my dad. Hey, Am. I've been in an accident. How bad? I rolled my truck. It's bad. You okay? Dad, I don't know. What do you mean? I can't feel my legs. Am, it's going to be okay. Yeah, you need to call Mom and tell her, okay? I'm sorry. It's okay. You're alive. You're talking to me. Miss, I'm gonna need you to put the phone away and concentrate on me. You can call him back. Hey, Dad, the paramedics are here, so I gotta go. Let me talk to them. I love you. Here, it's my dad. How is she? Sir, your daughter is conscious and alert at the moment. That's all I can tell you. We're going to be taking her to Carbon County Memorial at Rawlins. I'm gonna stabilize you and pull you forward a little bit, so please just try to remain calm and still. There you go. Never broken a bone, never been in a hospital. I've never had an IV. Well, you're about to have a lot of them. I'm gonna pull you forward, okay? One, two, three. Dad? Put your mom on the phone. - Dad, what's wrong? - Put your mom on the phone. Okay! Mom, it's Dad. Hey. It's Am. What? She's been in an accident. Mom, where are you going? I'm going to Rawlins. I'm going to the hospital in Rawlins. Mom, you're not dressed. You don't even have shoes on. I'm gonna go get some clothes. I'm gonna, um... I'm gonna call Stacey. She's gotta come with me. I need you to stay and take care of the family, okay? You're staying here. - I'll call Ashley. - I'm gonna go kiss my babies. ...but we weren't able to get into the ones on her. Single MVA victim with possible severe spine injury. Patient awake and alert. I need vitals. Get trauma one prepped. ...cervical thoracic. They're flying her to Casper Wyoming Med. They have the best doctors there. I'll text you when I know more. Thanks. Thank you, Stacey. Thank you for this. Tina, you're family. Anything you need, I'm here. Am texted me this sunrise this morning. It had to be right before the... I didn't even respond. I didn't tell her that I loved her. I gotta get to her. Hey, it's Bill. I'm here. You're doing great. I'm scared. I know. I'll be with you on that plane to Casper. Don't worry. Wait. Is that... - That can't be... - Oh, Tina! Oh, no! Stacey, pull over. Stacey, pull the car over! Okay. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! No! No! Tina. This is my daughter's truck. Tina, wait! I'm just... Tina! These are her things. I'm just gonna... Tina, honey... Stacey! It's okay. Oh, my God! Let's go. Can someone help me? - I'm looking for my daughter. - Ma'am! Hi. I'm looking for Amberley Snyder. I'm her mother. She just got out of surgery. The doctor will update you. - Dr. Patel? - Mrs. Snyder? How is she? - We've done what we can. - Okay. We had to open up her spine and attach two titanium rods in order to stabilize her. So you fixed her? Mrs. Snyder, your daughter's T12 vertebrae was crushed, causing severe spinal cord injury. We pieced together what we could. I don't know what that means. It appears that the spinal cord isn't completely severed. Okay, so it's still intact? Well, Mrs. Snyder, even with that, she'll be confined to a wheelchair for the rest of her life. You don't know my Am. You don't know her, so... Mrs. Snyder, the paralysis, it's permanent. Please can you just stop and take me to her right now? - Please just take me to my daughter. - Yes, ma'am, right this way. If you need anything, we'll be right outside. Okay. Hi, baby. I'm sorry it took me so long to get here. God, please make my child whole. Please. Please help my baby. I love you. Baby. Hi, baby. Hi, baby. I'm right here. I love you so much. Cory, it's Christmas Eve, and the kids are inside opening presents, and we're missing it. Yeah, Dad, and it's cold. Cold is not good for horses. They need to be warmed up. - They all got rode this morning. - Really? Even this big boy? Daddy! Hi. - Thanks, Billy. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. Easy! Whoa. He's high-spirited. That's a lot of horse for a little girl. Not just any little girl. Got a lot of power. Power... That's your name. Power. Oh... You and me, bubba. We're going to win. Hey, baby, I'm here. - I'm so sorry. - No. It's okay, baby. I got you. I got you, baby. - I'm sorry. - No, baby. No. I got you. Look at you. You're up. I'm so happy to see you. Daddy is coming. Everybody is so, so excited to see you. My legs? My legs? Baby. My legs? Mom? Honey, I'm sorry. You're paralyzed, baby. I'm so sorry. I know. I'm so sorry. It's gonna be okay. I promise. - No! - I know. I'm so sorry. No! I'm sorry. Hey. It's okay. How's our girl? She's finally sleeping. - My girl? - I'm a mess. Out here, I'm a mess. We both have to keep it together when we're in there, but... I don't know. It's so hard. I got a call from the insurance company. They said now that Am is through with her operations... That's great. Now, she can go into rehab. Except... she can only be transported by air. They won't pay to fly her back to Provo. Ugh. Come on. It's 25 grand, and I'm not playing for the Dodgers. We can't do it here. It's six weeks. Rehab is six weeks. She has to be by her family. We'll figure it out, okay? Okay. Okay. Hey. You have a visitor. I'm not really in the mood, Mom. What did the doctor say? That they don't know who or what they're dealing with. Dad! I'm full of steel. You're not going to hurt me. She's good. Strong. Very strong. She's got a drive like I never had. Looks like that girls is not stopping till she gets to the NFR. National Finals? She's got college in the fall. She know that? So, you'll coach me? We start Saturday morning. Be here at 7:00 a.m. You're late, we're done. Everybody is here to see you. Mom, I can't. I'm too tired. Please just get me out of here. Cory, who are all these people? They're all here to support our girl. And guess what. MLB Players' Assistance Team, they donated to pay for the flight. Yeah, they helped with this also. That's wonderful, but... she can't handle that right now. I gotta get her to the hospital. Tell them all thank you. I'll take care of it, kid. ] Ma'am, we're ready. You're a good man, Cory Snyder. I keep telling you that. Ready to roll, Mike. Do that later. Oh, no, sweet pea, we must rotate our body every two hours, or we will get pressure sores, and we don't want that. We? Somebody needs to roll you too? Ha! They can try. Why don't you show me how to do that? Now, no, what would you have me do if I showed you how to do my job? Well, I'm here 24/7. I can haul 100 bales of hay. I can handle this. Mom, you gotta go work the horses. Nope, everybody's pitching in. Well, you don't need to stay here. Hey. I'm not going anywhere. Face it. You're stuck with me. Like mother, like daughter. What's that? Learn to love that chair. That is your freedom. I'll check in on you later. We are going to get ourselves right out of your hair. We need some lunch. Blessings abound, my child. Sometimes a little tough to see. Come on, Am. Let's go! Dig! Use your legs, Am! Let's go! Dig! Let's go! Go! Let's go! Go! Go! 17.6 seconds. That puts Amberley Snyder in second place. Give her a round of applause. Dad, she was so close. Let me talk to her. You got some work to do. Second place, first loser. Be better next time. We should have beaten that time. Power really fought me. No excuses. You want to be the best, second place won't cut it. She knows that. Right, okay. So, first step here, we want to build up our strength and our balance. Go ahead and lock your wheels for me. Mm-hmm. And you can go ahead and lift your legs out of your leg rests. Now, some tools that really help us to speed along our work: focus and goals. So, let's start with the easy ones. What are things you see yourself doing? Easy. Walk. Ride. Rodeo. Okay. That came out fast. My daughter, not one to hold back. No, very ambitious goals. I love a challenge. Okay. So, what we wanna do is we wanna get into a standing position. So, go ahead and grab a bar with each arm, okay? You're gonna use that upper body strength to pull yourself up. Now, this first time, I'm gonna be doing the majority of the work, all right? I've got you. - Okay? - Okay. All right. So, on the count of three, we're gonna rock, and we're gonna get you up. Ready? One, two, three. Great. Yep, you're standing. How do you feel? Mom, Diego is touching my butt. Nope, these are your hips. I'm at your hips. Diego, it looks like you're touching my daughter's butt. Ma'am, this is part of what we have... I see how it is here. You two are funny. All right, I'm putting you down, all right? Come on. Really good. Okay. All right, this time, you're gonna do the majority of the work. You might not get standing all the way up, and that's okay. We just want to build up that upper body strength, okay? All right, same thing. We're gonna go on the count of three. Give it all you got. Ready? One, two, three. Yep, try to stand. Come on. Push. Really good. Really, you got it. Yes! Hey. We're gonna make a little progress every day, yeah? All right, let's... Hold on. We're gonna do this together, okay? You gotta wait for me. Come on. All right, count of three. One, two, three. Yep. Drop. Drop. All right. That was good. Really good. One, two, three. Yep, come on. Push. There you go. You go this. Keep going. Come on. - Yep, push! - Mom. Drop. Perfect. We're done. We're done here. No, she's doing really good. Do you wanna stop? Yeah, we're done. Okay. - Get the door? - Okay, baby. Okay. I'm sorry, honey. It's okay. Your dad is getting everything ready at the house. He's even putting in a custom elevator in the pantry. And Autumn is so excited to see you. Everyone is. Great. Oh, and before I forget, this kid, Tate Watkins, keeps emailing. You had that FFA speech scheduled for the end of next month. You have to cancel it. I can't. No, yeah. I mean, that's what I told him. But this kid is funny. He really wants you there. He said he's going to be re-schedule it for when you get better. Oh! When am I gonna get better? I'm not going in this thing. Hey! Look who's here. - Put that away. - Okay. Hi. - Hey, guys. - Hey. Dad is picking up Taylor and Aubrey. Yeah, they'll be here in, like, 15 minutes. So, who's riding Power? Me. Did he buck yet? I told her. I got right back on him. Good. Come here. You can do this. Okay, it's all in the technique. You want to grab on the push rim as far back as you can without overextending your shoulders. When you're first starting out, you can cheat a little bit - and grab the tire and... - Okay! I get it. Go. Wow! Okay. All right, watch me. That... is how I roll. Oh... Okay. That was sorry. Really? You think you can do better? - Are you challenging me? - Yes, I am. Oh! Please. - It's on. - Show him, Am. Show him. Am! Am! Am! Am! Am! Am! You got it! You got this. Yeah, you got this! - I can do it. - You got it. - I can do it. - I got you. It's okay. Let go. I had it. Hey, with practice. Look, it's not just about your arms. It's about your balance too. You've been using your legs to balance your entire life. Now, as you start to do more stuff for yourself, you're gonna find things that once came naturally are now difficult, and that's okay. That's what we're gonna work through. Diego tells me you canceled therapy. Mom, I'm spending my 19th birthday here... like this. What's the point? Look... it takes time. I'm stuck in that chair for the rest of my life. Okay, I know. I get it. You don't get it. You don't get it. I am so sick of you feeling sorry for yourself. How long did it take you and Power to put together a good barrel run? - But that's different! - No, it's not. Now, get in. You're going to therapy. See you there. What are you doing here? Diego said you were having balance issues. Remember where your balance was best? Happy birthday, baby girl. We both know that you were best in the saddle. It's where you learned balance. It makes sense. So, what's the plan? Am, if it's not to ride again, so be it. But it won't be because you didn't try. One, two, three. Okay. Reposition. Good. This feels weird. All right. Hey, straighten up. Use your upper body position to find your balance. Yeah? Feel your core. Trust your instincts. You got this. I'm gonna let you go. Find your balance. When I come back, you better have those shoes on. - Stay the hell out! - Oh... Boy! You better be glad that missed. Hey, Felice. That's Tuck Morgan, right? Oh, yes. You know, that boy is trying my last damn nerve. He came in last week. Terrible car crash. Mmm. I heard about him. He's a bull rider. Oui! A very angry bull rider. The child won't start therapy. He refuses to talk to anyone. I get it. I knew you would. Tuck, right? Get out. I'm Amberley. How you doing? Fine. I used to say, "Fine." But I know it's not fine. And I know it's not good. I mean... I know. The doctors came in. That nurse, my family, all they wanted to hear was that I was fine. But... inside, I knew how bad it was. My future was... pretty bleak. No one could understand that. My life is over. Done. I used to feel that way. I can't do anything for myself anymore. That's just not me. I used to throw a saddle on my horse and ride all day. No one could stop me. Got better for me when I started therapy - Not doing therapy. - Not forcing you. But it might help. Really helped me. You're still never gonna walk again. Maybe not. But I'll tell you what. I am gonna get on a horse again. That's crazy. You know what's crazy? Eight seconds on a bull, but... you've already done that. Everybody got their money for the lotto? We are going to win this time. Felice! Today is the day. Wow, well... you've been a handful. I'll miss you, too. Aw! Mmm. Really hope you cheer up. Honey, this is what I've been blessed with. Now, you go on home and get your glory. Felice, thank you. We never could have done this without you. Hey. Looks like I'm graduating. Mm-hmm. Don't sweat the curbs. And remember that going up is your biggest threat, okay? - Get that momentum. Pop a wheelie... - I know. Diego, you have been amazing. So have you. Listen, out there... no matter what life gives you... give more back. You know it. Bye, Amberley. Tuck. You ready, man? So, why don't we talk about the things that you see yourself doing? 'Cause if we have a goal, you keep picturing it in your mind, you can stay focused on it. Home, sweet home. Mom, I don't think I'm ready for this. No one is home, right? Just your dad. Ashley took everyone to dinner. Welcome home, baby girl. - Hey, you wanna get that chair? - Sure. Okay. Put this down first. - Sorry. - It's okay. Okay. I'm headed out. I've gotta go pick up Aubrey from dance. Here you go. You gonna be all right? Can't get very far. Amberley... I'm fine. I'll be home soon. Hey, guys. Remember me? Hi, Lacey. Did you miss me? Hey, Power. You miss me? Power, come here. I'm sorry. I wish I could saddle you up and just go for a ride, you and me. Hey, there. It's Tina Snyder. Go on and leave a message, and you have a blessed day. Hey, Mom, just curious when you're coming home. Call me. Mom! Hey, Mom! Mom, look! Hey, Mom! Mom! Look at that. My plan worked. Leaving the horses out. I knew she couldn't resist. Oh! I'm sorry. I was waving you over. I was stuck. You couldn't tell? I was so happy to see you with those horses. - I just... I didn't know. - Just... Just leave me alone. I can't do that. I'm your Mamacita, and I'm not going anywhere. And I'm going to be here for both of us until you can be there for yourself. Will you promise me something? Anything. That I'll ride again. If I have to strap you in that saddle myself. You and me, bubba. You ready? Are you seriously asking me that? All right, here we go. Yeah, Amberley! - Woo! - Come on, Am. How does it feel, Am? Fine. - Yeah, Am! - You got this, Am! Woo! You got this! Stop! What's wrong? Don't you wanna go in the arena? No. Take me in. Hey, you'll have to give this a chance. It's never gonna be the same. I could tell the second I got up here. There's nothing I can do about it. - Am... - Just get me off this thing. All right, that's gonna be enough for today. No, I wanna see you ride more. Maybe another time. You know that was just the first time out, right? Yeah. When I look at you, I still see the same girl I knew before the accident. I'm different. No, you're not. Not on the inside. The Amberley I know wouldn't be beaten until she'd done absolutely everything she could first. You can't understand. Nobody can. Love you. She's hardly been down here with the horses. Autumn, you gotta give her some time. Until then, these horses aren't gonna clean up after themselves. Hey, buster! Go on. Go get the wheelbarrow. Hello? Why won't you leave me alone? - What? - Oh! Tate, good morning. Amberley Snyder. Did I wake you up? No, it's okay. I'm up. Yeah, you need to stop emailing me. I don't know you, and you need to stop reminding me of stuff I can't do. I'm not going. Slow down. Let's talk. You know, I rodeo too. Yeah? What's your event? Saddle bronc riding. Sitting third in the standings for our circuit. That's awesome. You bronc riders are nuts. No, just hard-headed. Before, every time on a horse, it felt like the most natural thing in the world. Like... breathing. And now, that's just gone. I can't do the one thing that I love to do. Maybe you could do something other than rodeo. Rodeo isn't something I do. Really, it's who I am. It's like... Breathing. I know. I'm sorry. Don't be. I just gotta find a way to wrap my mind around this new reality. But, um... - maybe we can... - Talk again. I'd like that. Me too. Am, I'm home! Come on outside. What? No way! Dad, this is crazy. Doctor said you should be ready to start driving. It's set up with hand controls and everything. But a truck? What? Mom, I can handle this. Let me show you how it works. Yeah, I got it. Gas, brakes. I gotta go. Are you sure you don't want us to go with you? Yeah. I love you. Bye. I'm good! It's all about keeping my balance. A seatbelt on a saddle. That is a new one on me. Well, I figure you can attach it behind the cantle. You think you can do that? Unbelievable. What? A seatbelt, it's what put me in this chair. It might be what gets me out. Hey, bubba. I got us something. Bubba, get over here. Don't be like that. Come on. It's me. I know it's new now, but... Wanna try? All right, let's do this. No! We'll get there. Yes! Woo! Ready to be my legs, bubba? Sweetest bale of hay I ever tossed. Easy-peasy. There you go, babe. Let's take it easy. I'm still not sold on this seat belt. 'Cita, have a little faith. You're gonna have to make him work without leg cues. We'll get there. I get this down, and I can start training again. I was talking to Stacey, and we had this idea. To get me ready to run? Hey, Am, you have the gift. You've had it since before you could even walk, but... But what? - Well... - I can still ride. Yes, but you could also coach. Stacey says that she needs you. You could help her with the kids. - Autumn is working with her now. - Oh, good for her! I'm not a coach. Yeah, but it might be a good way to just get you... To give up on rodeo? Stacey needs you. Autumn needs you. You could take those riders to a new level. I can't believe this. What? You're telling me that God wants me like this? No, honey, I think he wants what's best for you. Well, then why did he give me this talent and then yank it away? And why did he give me a mother that doesn't believe in me and treats me like a cripple? Am! Wait. That's not what I meant. Come here. Autumn. Hey. - Take Lacey. Put her away. - Okay. Am, I'm sorry. That coaching idea was wrong. I shouldn't have said... Sell my horses. You don't mean that. I'm done. Hey, it's just gonna take some time. If I can't ride like I used to, I never wanna ride again. Hey, don't you give up. It kills me that I can't fix this. I should have died in that crash. Hey, don't you say that! Don't you dare say that! I thank God every day that you are here. And I know that everything is different. But we're just gonna have to find a new way to live with this. - Are you done? - Hey! This chair will either be your wings, or it will be your anchor. You decide. Amberley, hey. Hey. Is everything okay? I wrote your intro. "FFA president, heading to Utah South, agricultural education." You gonna say it like that? I haven't done this a lot. I put in all the rodeo stuff, like winning Little Britches. Yeah. Two saddles, finals, and world. Listen, if I suck up there, you can boo me off the stage. Wait. What's your plan here? Oh, my God! I didn't think! I swear! No worries. Um... Is there an elevator? Yeah, right over there. Tate... are those for me? Oh! Yeah. Lilies, my fave. Thank you. You're welcome. There are some goals that may be out of my grasp for now. Dreams that are just... too big. Horses, rodeo. But you know what? I'm working on new goals, new dreams. I start Utah South in two weeks. I've learned we don't always get to choose what happens to us, but we do get to choose what we do next. Most importantly, we never give up. Someone once told me, "No matter what life gives you, give more back." I think I might just sit in on chemistry to see if I wanna... Right. So, Tate... Is he, like, your boyfriend? I don't think we're there yet. But you wanna be. Hello? Amberley, Jenna Walters from American Morning. - No way. - Who is it? Shut up! It's Jenna Walters. No way! Listen, we'd like to do a profile piece on you. People really want to hear your story, and somebody told me you were back on your horse again. So we thought it would be very inspiring to people facing difficult situations. You are riding again, right? Yeah, I can ride him around a little. Perfect. I can be down there with my crew on Saturday. - This Saturday? - See you then. What just happened? You haven't been on your horse in two months. And the last time you were, you said you were never getting on your horse again. I miss it so much. I mean, are you up for this? What about your new dreams? Well, I can't bail now. The doctors asked me what my goals were. I knew right away: Walk. Ride. Rodeo. That's a tall order. Is there a future in rodeo? Really, I'm the only one who can decide what I'm capable of. I've got a lot of work to do. But, hey, whatever life gives you, you've got three choices. You can either give up, give in, or give it your all. And I figured it was time that I gave it my all. Thank you, Amberley. It's an incredible story. We'll be watching for you. - That's it. I think we've got it. - Cool. Let's just get some B-roll of her riding, okay? Good job. Am is doing great. I know. It's crazy. Jenna Walters is just sitting in our barn. Well, they're about to finish up, and she's gonna get on Power, and I'm freaking out a little bit, so... Yes, Cory, I promise. I won't forget to breathe. - Amberley, you got this! - There you go. Come on, Am! You ready, Am? Hey, stay close. You and me, bubba. I can't tell you what to do with my legs anymore. Listen to my voice. Just once around. Easy. Come on, you're a natural, you got this! Hey, you don't wanna miss this. You got it, Am. Keep going. Woo! - Go, Am! - Keep going, girl! Whoa! Oh, sweet Jesus! Whoa! - Come on, Am! - Come on, Am! Keep going! Mom, he's behaving like a prince. Well, look at that! - Am, you ready? - Yeah, good. I'm ready. Give it up for number 17, Jenny Watkins. - Do you think Amberley will win? - Heck, yeah! - You a fan? - Yes, sir. I'm Tate, Tate Watkins. The boy from Montana. We'll get acquainted later. Excuse me. Okay. What if she falls? She gets hurt? Hey, I'm going nuts as it is. Sorry. Somebody had to say it. Am is just here for practice, see what she can do. Yeah, well, she's gonna do great. Is she ready? I'm letting her decide that. - She's put in the work. - She has. You ask me, I say you haven't the sense God gave you! Letting your handicapped child on a horse. Handicapped? So reckless! What kind of a mother are you? You know what? I'm gonna show you what kind of a mother I am. - It's okay. - Nobody asked you. That's right. Nobody asked you. - That is none of your... - Hey, it's all right. Up next, we have a real comeback kid. Just months after her accident... I still can't believe this. ...ready to take her first run, Amberley Snyder on Power. - Amberley! - Come on, baby! Yeah! Who is that? The boy from Montana. Hmm! Yeah! Hey, bubba, they said you and I would never be back here. Welcome to never. 17.6 seconds. Good enough for second place. What a ride, folks! What a ride! Amberley Snyder, give it up for her one more time. Amberley is amazing! Yeah! Second place, not first loser? No way! It feels like... I don't know. The greatest feeling ever. Yeah! Way to go! Ashley took them all out for pizza. Should be back in an hour or so. Tina, honey... what's going on? I... I'm sorry. I should be happy, and I am. I just... I mean, she's... She's alive, and she's here, and she's back on the horse. We got our girl back. But then I see her in that chair. I can't... I just can't do anything. I can't fix her. I can't protect her. Every time I look at her, it hits me. I told her not to take that truck. You know, I stood there with her. - And I let her go. - It's not your fault. There's so many things she's never gonna be able to do, you know? She's never gonna be able to walk down the aisle. She's never gonna be able to run with her kids. She's not gonna have - the same opportunities... - She has you. No matter what happens. I say sky is the limit. Mom, you know I can make a faster run. I know, baby, but let's take it one rodeo at a time. Hey, Am. Stacey! How is she riding? Like a winner. Still recovering, but getting there. Got word from Andrea Busby at Busby Quarter Horses. They want to put you up for the Fan Favorite Exemption at The American this year. No way! That's awesome. It's a long shot, but they've been following your story, and they want to get it started for you. Power, do you hear that? The American! 'Cita? Power is ready. Not sure about you. The American is as big as it gets. Well, I guess we got work to do. Incredible! Less than a year after her truck accident, Amberley Snyder is back with a time of 17.7 seconds. This cowgirl continues to amaze. She is up for the Fan Favorite Exemption at The American, and she is showing us why. 17.5 seconds. That's a first-place finish for Amberley Snyder. I simply can't believe it. 17.42 seconds for Amberley Snyder. Look at this girl run. The American should make some room. Unbelievable. Give this little lady a round of applause. And she's coming around the second barrel. It's a heck of a... Whoa! That's a downed barrel, folks. That's gonna cost her a five-second penalty. A time of 22.7 seconds. Putting Amberley Snyder outside of our top five riders. - Hey. - Hey. - That was a little rough. - Yeah. Well, you're gonna have to get him ready for regionals in Pocatello soon. We gotta get faster if I'm gonna go The American. We'll get you there. Ready? Gotcha. Thanks. What's on your pants? Huh? Oh! I must have just sat in something. Smooth. Okay, who's next? That's the last one unless you wanna ride the donkey. I do not know what is going on with you. I don't know what kind of bug you got, but it's making you all wonky. I'm gonna go inside, and I'm gonna make you a protein smoothie. You need to start taking better care of yourself. You know that? All right, give me your weight. I got you. Okay. There you go. Those horses are getting hungry. Come on. Let's go. I'll meet you inside, all right? Hey, Mom, I don't feel very... Amberley! Baby. Come here. Okay. - Mom, what can I do? - JC, go get the keys. Autumn, open the door! Open the back door! Well, the infection is serious. You've got a softball-sized ulcer that goes right down to the bone. This is extremely critical, life-threatening. I'll tell you, if you had waited two more days, you could have died. My kid is dying right in front of me. I don't even see it? We've got her on IV antibiotics now, but we need to operate right away. No, I've got two rodeos this weekend and a shot at The American. Are you kidding me? This infection will kill you if we don't treat it now. You'll need intensive wound care and be on long-term antibiotics. No riding. What? No, then I'm not doing it. I'm not doing it. Can I talk to my daughter alone, please? Good luck. Do you want to die? Let me know now, and I'll get ready to bury my child, because this... I can't go through this again. I won't. I am not strong enough. So if you wanna kill yourself, you're gonna put me in that box right next to you. I don't wanna die. Why the hell did you not tell me? Just don't make me stop. Am, you just have to know your limits. No! It's all gonna go away! What are you talking about? I lost my legs. Everything changed in that one moment. But then, I was me again. I was riding. And I was just afraid that if I told you, that if you knew, it would all go away. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. It's okay, my baby. It's okay. Come here. One turkey sandwich, cheddar cheese and no crust. - Thanks. - For you. Uh-uh. Only for Amberley. That's a ridiculous amount of fan mail. There's even more online. "I'm ten and live in San Antonio, Texas. I got hit by a car and am in a wheelchair just like you. I used to feel like giving up, but I see what you do, and it makes me want to try harder. I can do great things too. Your fan, Brittany Carlson." What do you want me to write back? Am, there are tons of more messages like that. Am, maybe you could help them. Let me see that. Oh, yeah! We're in The American. Bubba, we're going to The American. The American! Come on. Let's go this way. Come on. Let's go. Mom, I should drive with you. No, it's better you fly in tomorrow. My nerves are working enough. I'll make sure she gets to the airport. Glad you got Legacy in there. Power travels better with company. You haven't had enough time to get ready. You've only run those barrels at competition-level three times. Mom, we've been over this. I feel great. Tina, we'll get her through a couple of runs before she leaves. And we'll train hard when we get to Texas. We'll have three days. I'm pumped, okay? I'll see you in Texas. See you in Texas. Hey, Am. Any better? It's worse. It's turning into snow. I think I might have to stop for the night. I'm sorry, honey. I know you need time to train. Okay, okay. Just be safe. I'll see you tomorrow night. Love you. Love you, too.Bye. Jeez! Ugh. How is Power? He's okay. This has to let up. I only have one more day. Mom, if I fail here, at The American, in front of thousands of people, that's gonna stick with me forever. Am, I'm really worried. You know that I can't quit. 'Cita, what? I was just thinking. I remember the first time I saw you riding. I mean, really riding. You were maybe ten years old. I was watching you, and I got jealous. Oh. Such a natural gift, even then. And now... the fact that you're even here after that accident... Honey, look how far you've taken yourself. Isn't that enough? If I decide to go for it, - give it my all... - Mmm. Well, then, I'm gonna be there for you. Always. What? Tate! What are you doing here? I thought you had to work. I do. My buddy, Justin, he's in the team roping competition. I'm just helping out with his horses. Why didn't you tell me? What fun would that be? Are you crazy? I wouldn't miss this for nothing. Hey. I gotta get you off there so Casey and Ryan can do final checks. Hey, Tate. Mrs. Snyder... ma'am, may I? Of course. Let me help you. Now get down here. You can put me down now. No, I can't. I could do that all day. Tate, thank you. For what? You're the first person that has made me feel like I'm not in this chair. All right, I guess I should put you down. Welcome to the RFD-TV's The American, the world's richest one-day rodeo. When the dust settles, the toughest competitors in the world will battle it out to be the best of the best. No turning back now. Mom. None of this... None of this would have happened without you. I know. I'm so proud of you, Am. I mean, look where you are. Can you believe it? You may have lost the use of your legs... but it's opened up your heart. Love you, Mom. I love you. You ready? Let's do this. Now, remember. It's not about winning. It's about the fact that you are here on this horse right now. Can it be a little about winning? Ride like the wind, baby. Leave them all standing. - Hi. I'm Tate. - Nice to meet you. That's my girlfriend. She's good. I'm freaking out, but... Go, Am! Steady, boy. You're all right. It's just a bigger crowd, but it's the same thing we always do. Listen to it. Ladies and gents, we have a Fan Favorite coming up. She's beaten incredible odds to get here. She's got a heart as big as Texas, Amberley Snyder. Go, Amberley! Go get 'em! Power, you and me. Attitude is a little thing that makes a big difference. I realize maybe I won't have control over every situation in my life. Maybe I don't get to make every decision. But when I wake up in the morning, I get to decide my attitude. Today is our day. And if that's the only decision I get to make that day... I better make it a good one. Because with the right attitude, who knows what you can achieve? Yeah! Wow! What a run! 15.369 seconds. I can't believe what we just watched. I mean, that was amazing. That puts Amberley Snyder up on the board with some of the very best in rodeo. When the doctors asked what my goals were, I said, "Walk. Ride. Rodeo." I got the last two. About that first one... maybe one day. ...around the second barrel. It's just perfect. She's perfect around three. Here comes Amberley Snyder, and she's gonna be amongst them with a 15.369. I'm telling you what. She played at a pro level here, girls. Getting a standing ovation here at AT&amp;T Stadium.
