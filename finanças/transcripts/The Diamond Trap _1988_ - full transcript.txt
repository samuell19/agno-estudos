[Engine starts] Woman: John? John... I'm so glad I caught up with you. Yeah. Well, I'm in a bit of a hurry Ms. Wilson. Wilson: John, I have some news that might be of interest to you. John: Yeah, but if I miss the ferry, I'm gonna be late for work. Another time, Ms. Wilson. [Gulls squawking] My name is John Rollings. I've been riding this old ferry boat for 22 years from Staten Island to Manhattan and back again in the evening. That is, if I'm not working nights, and in my line of work, that occurs more often than not. Over the years, I kept thinking I should have moved into the city. Most everybody thought I would when my wife died 6 years ago, but I couldn't make the break from Staten Island. Besides, that's where my clothes are. There's no lady in my life right now, except that one over there, and although I do love to see her, she's only passing acquaintance. You probably wonder what I do. If you haven't already guessed, I'm a cop, a detective actually, and that might sound exciting, but after 22 years, I'm still waiting for the headline with my name in it. Morning, Brendan. Brendan: Come on. We got to hustle. John: You hustle. I plod. Brendan: Hey, you hear about Larry Pergoff up at 39? John: What, the new kid? Brendan: Yeah, young hotshot, busted a counterfeit ring Uptown. John: Mm-hmm. Brendan: Yeah. Big headlines. John: How come we never read about any old hotshots? [Car horn honks] Brendan: Look at this guy, drives like my grandmother. This makes me crazy. You know we're not gonna make it on time. The hooker's gonna come and go. John: Yeah, tragedy, another penny-ante criminal slips the clutches of the law. Brendan: John, John, don't do that, all right? It's against regs. Please. John: Brendan, no guts, no glory. Just step on it, OK? [Siren] [Siren stops] [Car horn honks] [Bell rings] Hi. Rollings, 21st, Thomas. You Rosencrantz? Rosencrantz: Yeah. I hope you guys appreciate this. I mean, there's no law says I had to call. John: Yeah. I'll put you up for a citation, OK? John: The hooker show up yet? Rosencrantz: Any time now. Brendan: Could we just see the stuff, please? Rosencrantz: Said there was more. I said to bring it in this morning, we deal. Brendan: Yeah. It checks. This is from the boost on 74th and Park. Rosencrantz: Is there some kind of a reward or something? John: You have the gratitude of your fellow New Yorkers? Is there some place where we can wait without being seen? Rosencrantz: Follow me. [Gate creaks] John: Very nice. Rosencrantz: Wise guys. You try to do the right thing, and then there's no thanks, nothing, just work. I'm gonna close it up someday. That's what I'm gonna do. John: You know, this is what keeps me in police work...drama. Brendan: Hey, John, you're killing me with that pipe. John: So don't breathe. [Door opens] [Bell rings] Brendan: It's a blond kid in tight, leather pants. It's not the hooker. Why'd you give me the high sign? Wake up and smell the coffee, Brendan. Freeze. Police. Man: Wonderful. Where do you work out? Brendan: Knock it off. Man: Listen. I could give you something. Brendan: Yeah. I bet you could. Man: I didn't steal that stuff, all right? John: Yeah. Listen, kid. You heard your rights. You talk, you roll the dice. There's no guarantees. Man: I see this guy Wally once or twice a month, you know, when he's got the buckeroos. I saw him two days ago, and that's when he gave me the stuff as a present. He knows I love nice things. John: Yeah. You didn't know it was stolen, right? Man: I didn't ask for a receipt, OK? Anyway, we had our little party, and he was drunk and snowblind, and he starts bragging, like, to impress me, you know, tells me these presents are nothing compared to what he promised me...a Jaguar just like his partner drives. Is that rich? John: What is this, a kaffeeklatsch? Get in the car. Man: Wait. Listen. They're planning something, man. They're planning something really big. If I tell you, I want your word that you'll talk to your people for me. John: What kind of something, how big? Man: Promise? John: See what I can do. What are we talking about? Man: Diamonds, 12.5 million scoots' worth. John: Why don't you get in the car, son? Man: 12.5 million, man. I'm not lying. [Car door closes] John: You never know. Brendan: John. [Engine starts] Man: You've got a trick boy with a head full of smoke and a pocketful of stolen goods singing you a song about diamond heist, and you want to put it on the hit parade. John: Granted, it's a reach, but the facts jibe. The Heritage Gallery Uptown is holding a diamond auction in 10 days, 12.5 million worth. Now, the kid says these guys have a woman inside the gallery working with them. Is it gonna hurt to check? Man: John, please. You got real work to do. Forget about it. John: Give me 24 hours. If we don't turn something, we'll go back to your nickels and dimes. Man: You believe him? John: If it pans out, it could be the biggest diamond heist in history. Man: Hundred bucks it's all smoke. John: Covered. Man: You got 24 hours. John: Yeah. I told the kid I'd see if the D.A.'d deal. Man: You come up with something solid, we'll then talk to the D.A. Meanwhile, that kid spends a little vacation time in the slammer. Brendan: [Clears throat] John: You get some bad news between there and here that I missed? Brendan: Think about it, John. This is nuts. This Wally character's a third-rate burglar who has to buy company. Now, do you really think he can pull a job like this? John: You know, some people aren't afraid to dream big. That's what made this country great. Hi. Looking for Jerry Donohoe. Jerry: I'm Donohoe. You Rollings? John: Yeah. My partner Brendan Thomas. Jerry: I got your message, and it's bull, pure bull. As head of security, I run a tight ship here. John: Well, I don't doubt that but we're just a couple of working stiffs doing our job, so I guess the sooner we can talk to your ladies, the quicker we'll be out of your hair. Jerry: All right, but I don't want to start a panic. John: Well, we'll kid-glove it all the way, OK? How many women do you have working for you? Jerry: 19 including janitorial. You're gonna be here all day. John: Looks like it. Jerry: Waste of time, believe me. Brendan: I understand exactly how you feel, Ms. Valin, that the streets are vicious these days. May I suggest you take a different way to work... then you don't have to pass by the construction site... because, unfortunately, my partner and I don't handle sexual harassment cases. Valin: Oh. Brendan: Well, we have everything we need, and we won't trouble you anymore. Thank you. Valin: No trouble at all. Fruit? Brendan: No, thank you. Valin: You? John: Uh, thanks. I'm trying to diet. You know, actually, I am gonna have banana. Thank you. Valin: You're welcome. Jerry: Could be dangerous, huh? Ma Barker was no spring chicken. John: Who's next? Jerry: Right here... Tara Holden. [Knocks on door] Ms. Holden, these men are police officers... Detectives Rollings and Thomas. They'd like a word. Tara: Did I forget to pay a traffic ticket? John: Nothing like that, Ms. Holden. Thanks, Jerry. Well, this is beautiful work. Tara: This is very mysterious. John: Oh, not really. It's just a routine procedure. I wasn't aware the Heritage Gallery dealt in such a variety of precious antiques. Tara: We do. John: Heh. So many beautiful things, so little time, huh... Tara: Mm. John: furnishings, art... astonishing. I mean, this is fantastic. Tara: Yes. It is, isn't it? John: Very beautiful. Tara: Yes. Was there something in particular you wanted to talk to me about, Detective? I have work to do. John: Oh, we won't keep you, Ms. Holden. It's just that I can't get over all these beautiful things. You know a man named Wally? Tara: Wally? I don't believe so. Should I? John: Well, not unless you're planning to help him rob this gallery. Tara: You found me out, Detective. I keep a stocking mask in my top drawer and the machine gun's over there in my cupboard. You are joking. John: Are you? How long have you worked here? Tara: My God, you are serious. I started work January of this year. Look. Mr. Donohoe can tell you all about me. He did a background check that would have given me a CIA clearance, and... John: Are we making you nervous? You seem kind of tense. Tara: Well, I am a bit edgy. I'm late on a deadline, and I'm a falling farther behind as we speak. I don't know anyone named Wally, but if I do run into a Wally, I promise, you'll be the first to know. [Lighter clicks] I'm sorry to have seemed inhospitable. John: Not at all. It was a pleasure meeting you Ms. Holden. Be sure to buy a permit for that machine gun. Tara: Ha! OK. Brendan: Thanks for your time, Ms. Holden. Tara: I wish I could have been more help to you. Is the gallery really going to be robbed? John: Life's full of surprises. Brendan: Heh. [Ding] Jerry: So? John: Nothing. Jerry: I could've told you that. Matter of fact, I did. Brendan: Hey, John, I'm sorry this thing didn't work out with you. I really am. John: Eh, don't fold till it's your turn. That Holden woman knows more than she's letting on. Brendan: Come on. There's nothing about that woman that doesn't spell class. She's pretty good-looking, too. John: Yeah, but I've been waiting for a case like this for 22 years. Brendan: I understand that, John, but there's nothing about the woman that even suggests that she could be involved with something like this. Face it. You just want it too bad. John: She said she was up against a deadline. She was a little edgy, chain-smoking, a little... There was only one cigarette in her ashtray. She didn't get nervous till we showed up. Brendan: Do you think maybe she emptied the ashtray before we got there? John: I think 12.5 million can bend the classiest person. Call it a hunch, OK? Brendan: Whatever you say. Excuse me. The kid said that Wally's partner drives a red Jag, right? Brendan: Yeah. Must be his main squeeze, huh? John: Or maybe he's that deadline she mentioned. Brendan: You want to follow them? John: No. I want to run that Jag through the computer. Well, Tara Holden's boyfriend is one of your basic unsavory types. You still think I'm howling in the dark? Brendan: Oh, come on. Don't gloat. I hate when you do that. John: Huh. You know, I am starved. Come on. You can buy me some cholesterol. Brendan: Can we go someplace where you don't have to sit on stools? John: Ha! [Ship's horn blows] Man: I said 24 hours. It's been 24 hours. I want a hundred bucks. John: We got a real possible here, Lieutenant. Give me till dark to work her. I'll make it double or nothing. Lieutenant: How possible? Brendan: The gallery's PR lady, she's involved with a guy who has a couple of priors for receiving hot property. His name is Edward Lopata. He did two years at Dannemora in '81. The girl's name is Tara Holden. She checks clean. Lieutenant: 7:00, John, something with some spine in it this time, or this one's history. John: Thank you, Lieutenant. By the way, don't count your money yet. Listen. Take some personal time. I want to waltz with her cheek to cheek. Brendan: Yeah. I bet you do. John: Give me an hour. [Car horns honk] [Knocks on door] Tara: Come in. Hello, Detective... John: Rollings, John Rollings. How you doing with that deadline? Tara: This job is nothing but deadlines. I really am very busy, so if you could tell me what I could do for you... John: That's quite an eye you got. Eddie give that to you? Tara: I don't see that that's any of your business, and I'd like you to go now. Perhaps I better call my lawyer. John: Maybe you'd better. You can tell him, you're under investigation for conspiracy to commit grand theft. It's a felony. He can meet us at the 21st Precinct. [Click click click] Here, Tara. Feel like a cup of coffee? I mean, I know a little place that's close by. It's nice and quiet. We could talk, may be way out of this. Tara: I don't know what you're talking about. John: You really do have your priorities screwed up. You know that, Tara? Is he worth it? Tara: [Exhales] No. He's an animal. [Sobs] He said he'd pour drain cleaner down my throat and... Oh, God. Oh... [Sobbing] Oh, God... John: It's OK. Tara: We met a month after I started work on the first of February. He'd come in nearly every day on his lunch hour. We started dating, and I fell in love with him. About 3 weeks ago, he told me what he was going to do and how I was going to help him and what he'd do to me if I didn't. I tried to talk him out of it last night, told him we would never pull it off. He gave me this as a sample of what I'd get if I tried to back out. John: So he doesn't know we've been asking around. You think I'd be sitting here if he did? We're gonna take him down, you and me. No. He'll think I turned against him. He'll think I sold him out. He'll come after me. John: Not as long as he thinks everything is going according to plan. Look. He needs you to make this thing work, so as long as he needs you, you're safe. You let him think you're still playing ball. If you walk now, he's gonna know something's wrong. The only chance you got's to help us nail him. How much you know about his game plan? Tara: Nothing, I swear to God. He said, he'll tell me what to do when he wants me to do it. He doesn't like questions. John: So tell me about the auction. Tara: It's the 16th, invitation only, 10 diamonds. John: That's it? I mean, I heard the figure 12.5 million. Tara: The Whitehall Diamond alone is worth over 6 million. Haven't you heard of it? John: No. Tara: 72.4 carats. It's one of the largest privately-held stones in the world. Woman: Do you like some more coffee? John: Fine. Tara: No, thank you. No one's supposed to know it's in the auction. That was part of the deal made with the elderly, English woman who owns it, no publicity. She's a total recluse. The diamond hasn't been seen publicly since 1939. It's all been kept very secret. John: So how did Eddie find out? Tara: I don't know, but he knows. Will I be arrested? John: I'll tell the D.A. you're working with us. My bet is immunity in exchange for testimony. If anything goes wrong, you'll have protection. Tara: If something goes wrong, I'll be dead. John: Interview with suspect Holden concluded. 11:07 A.M. She was advised to keep us informed of any and all contact with Eddie Lopata, et cetera, et cetera. Lieutenant: You're a smug mother, you know? What do I owe you, a hundred? John: Think it was double or nothing. Lieutenant: Double? That's 200. John: I'll put it on your tab. Lieutenant: How big's my tab now? John: I don't know, 5, 10 grand tops. Lieutenant: And I'll never get to retire. Listen. How far is this Holden woman willing to go? John: Far as it takes to stay out of jail. I've already talked to Grossman in the D.A.'s office. He'll deal. Lieutenant: Then I guess you better brief the chief. John: [Scoffs] Lieutenant: Brendan, I want you to do me a favor. I want you to birddog him, eh? Anything, anything that he tells the chief, I want you to tell me. You got it? Brendan: Why do I always have to be the grown-up? John: ♪ Day, he said, "Day-o" ♪ ♪ Forget days 'cause you doing years ♪ ♪ Day ♪ ♪ He said, "Day," he said, "Day," he said ♪ ♪ "Well, forget the days, boy, 'cause you doing years" ♪ ♪ The beautiful diamonds are in the gallery ♪ ♪ Daylight come, and the bad man failed ♪ ♪ 'Cause cops are waiting in the alleyway ♪ ♪ See the bad man, he go to jail ♪ ♪ Day, he said, "Day-o" ♪ ♪ Forget days ♪ ♪ You doing years ♪ ♪ Day ♪ ♪ He said, "Day," he said, "Day," he said ♪ ♪ "Well, forget days, boy, 'cause you'll do years" ♪ Wilson: John, I have to ask you, are you busy tonight? My recently widowed niece, who's still young and very attractive, is coming out to supper tonight. I told her all about you. John: Yeah. Well, I'm I think I'm gonna be staying in town tonight, Ms. Wilson. Wilson: John, you need female companionship. It's not healthy for a man like you to go on like that... all alone, playing all that crazy music till all hours of the night. John: Well, I'm sorry if that kept you awake. Wilson: John would your Melissa...God rest her soul... want you living out your days with Harry Belafonte for company? Come on, John. Melissa's been gone for six years. A man your age, still young and vital... John: Look. I'm sorry, Ms. Wilson. I'm working on something important. I don't want to miss the ferry. Wilson: Harry Belafonte. He could at least play Irving Berlin. Man: Hey, funeral today, John? John: Worse...the chief. Man: Woman called for you earlier, John. I wrote it down. She says it's important. Here it is. No. This...no. John: Was this Holden, Tara Holden? Man: I wrote it down, very important, she says. Here. Have a Danish. You look thin, John. John: Thank you, Nuzat. Ha! They're green. Nuzat: Ah, here it is... a Tara Holden, call important, Heritage Gallery. I knew I'd find it. John: You're a prince. [Telephone rings] [Ring] Tara: Yes? John: Tara, John Rollings. Tara: I'm glad you called. He wants the floor plans to the gallery, the alarm systems, and the safe's location. John: That's good. It's good. Did you give it to him? Tara: Yes. John: Are you OK? Tara: I'm scared, really scared. Are you sure this is the only way? John: It's the only way the D.A.'ll play. Look. Everything is gonna be fine. You just relax. I'll come by to see you later, OK? Thanks, Nuzat. Well, you're obviously ready. Brendan: Thanks. John: So let's go. Incidentally, Eddie Lopata, wants Tara to fork over the floor plans. I think she's running a little scared. Brendan: Hey, don't worry about her. She's a gutsy lady. John: Mm-hmm. Brendan: You know, I really hate this. John: Eh, relax, OK? Brendan: Yeah? Well, my palms are all sweaty. I feel like a kid going to the dentist's office. John: Ha! Well, if you play cards right, you might get your photo taken with the chief, be something to show your as-yet-unborn generations. Brendan: You know, your suit smells like mothballs. John: Doesn't get out much. Walter: Good. Good, solid police work, gentleman. Yes. Your contact with this Holden woman appears to be bearing fruit. Do you have this Pilada... Brendan: Lopata. Walter: Lopata person under surveillance? Brendan: No, sir, so far, no direct contact. John: We're taking our cues from Tara...Ms. Holden. Walter: Oh, well you should. Well you should. Yes. Well, all right. Now let's put this on the front burner, gentlemen, huh? Yeah. This appears to be much more than a conspiracy case. Oh, my, yes. Yeah. Well, if we handle this right, we can bust this bunch in the act, drop the hammer on them while they're committing the very robbery. Ye... Do you realize what this could mean to this department in the way of public trust and confidence, hmm? I mean, the press, the media will go wild. "NYPD foils largest diamond heist." John: Am I understanding you correctly, sir? Are you suggesting we allow them to rob the gallery? Walter: Yes. Of course. That's exactly right. We'll be right there waiting for them to catch them with the pants down. No. We cannot waste an opportunity like this, gentlemen. No, no. With the Holden woman inside the gang, why, we'll know every move they make. It's foolproof. Thank you very much, gentlemen. We'll take it from here. We need the very best men we can get on this job. Johnson... John: Sir... with all due respect, sir, it is our case. We turned it. We'd like to stay with it, and I think I should head the special team. Walter: Oh, you do? Well, you're not a man who's plagued by self-doubts, are you, hmm? John: Tara Holden is the wheel this whole thing turns on, and I have established a relationship with her. Now, if I am not involved, I doubt she will be. Walter: She's so fond of you, she'd rather face prison than be denied the pleasure of your company. Is that what you're telling me, hmm? John: She trusts me. You cut me loose, she's gonna panic. Without her total cooperation, this thing is never gonna come off. I'd like to put together my own team with men from the 21st, sir, men that I know and trust. Walter: Who the hell do you think you are, mister? John: I wouldn't ask for this responsibility if I wasn't damn sure I could handle it, sir. If I don't perform satisfactorily, I'll step aside. You have my word on it. Walter: You'll report directly to me... and, Rollings, if you screw up, there won't be a hole deep enough to hide in. You're excused. Brendan: Well, Yeah. Yeah. Oh... [Ding] [Knocks on door] [Door opens] John: Hi. Tara: Hi. John: You OK? Tara: Yeah, a little shaky, but I'm all right. You look very sharp, Mr. Rollings. John: Thank you. Like I say, dress for success. My chief has put me in charge of this investigation. Tara: That's wonderful, John. John: Yeah. Now all I got to do is convince your boss to get in the game. The eye looks a lot better. Tara: The power of makeup. John: Yeah. This is for you. Tara: How sweet of you. It...it's lovely. It's... John: It's an ashtray. I made it myself... Tara: Oh. John: just a token of my appreciation for everything you're doing. Tara: Oh, I'm touched, really. I'll always treasure it. John: We better go up, don't want to keep the man waiting. Tara: Yeah. Man: Am I to understand, sir, that you expect me to furnish these thieves with the very tools they need to rob this gallery? John: Yes, sir. That's a bottom line, sir. We feel that it's the best way... Man: This is preposterous, and I don't like at all your using Ms. Holden as an informant, exposing her to that risk. Tara: I'm in no danger, Mr. Exeter, unless Eddie Lopata realizes that the police are onto him. If I don't continue the charade, there aren't enough cops in the city to protect me. John: You can help put these men where they belong, sir, behind bars. Exeter: It's foolhardy. It's very dangerous. John: Your diamonds will never be in jeopardy. These men are under constant surveillance, and Ms. Holden will provide us with the newest development in their plan. It's foolproof. Of course, there is one alternative left open to us. Exeter: Ah. What might that be? John: Cancel the auction, sir. Jerry: I run a tight ship here and have for 6 years. We've never had a problem, and I don't appreciate being kept in the dark on this after you promised me. John: That's what this is about, Jerry. Mr. Exeter, we can make this work. However, if you'd feel better canceling the auction, we'll understand. Exeter: Canceling the auction's out of the question. John: I can tell the chief we have your cooperation? Exeter: Very well. We're all at your disposal. I believe it was Herodotus who admonished us that if the world were just, there'd be no need for valor. John: Herodotus? I believe that was Plutarch, but I really don't have time to discuss it, very busy. Thank you. Tara: Mr. Exeter. [Door closes] Brendan: [Exhales] John: You know, this Whitehall Diamond has some kind of history. Sir Charles Whitehall bequeathed it to his mistress in his will. He was 45 when they met. She was 17. Ha! They were lovers right up until his death in 1938. Brendan: Well... John: Ms. Waring must have been a real scorcher. Brendan: The wages of sin pay pretty well. How old do you think she is now, about 80? John: Yeah. She's a total recluse, never leaves her estate. The diamond hasn't been seen publicly since 1939. Tara says the terms of the sale are so secretive... Brendan: "Tara says." That's all I've heard lately, is "Tara says." You two got something going, or what? Look at me. You old dog, I don't believe it! She's young enough to be your... John: Sister. Yeah. Forget it, OK? I don't mix business with pleasure. Brendan: Well, if I were you, I'd turn in my badge in because the lady's hot for you. God only knows why. John: Will you come off it? I mean, you are more her type. Brendan: All right. I admit it. I'm jealous, and I'm also impressed because I never thought she'd play this hand out. The lady's got a lot of brass. How long do you think before Eddie makes his move how that he's got all the goodies? John: Well, the auction is just around the corner, and so are we. You got anything like a beer in that vegetable patch you call a refrigerator? Brendan: It's empty calories, pal. John: Ohh, you know, this health kick of yours, it's killing me. Brendan: Hey, what are you doing? John: Look. Just let me smoke, OK? I mean, I'm allergic to the smell of sweat. Brendan: You can smoke on the terrace. John: I will smoke out on the terrace. [Piano playing] Sorry we're late. Brendan: Yeah. It couldn't be helped. Tara: It's on for Monday night, the 16th. The Whitehall Diamond comes in from London on Sunday, and the rest of the diamonds will be delivered Saturday. I'm supposed to let him know guard schedules, camera positions. Brendan: Could you please start again slowly? John: Just one step at a time, every detail, OK? Take your time. Tara: [Exhales] John: According to our source, the two men will hide themselves in this third-floor storage room when the gallery closes at 6:30 Monday afternoon. Now, at 10 P.M. sharp, they'll exit the storage room, make their way across the gallery, through this corridor, and into this stairwell. Emerging on the fourth floor, they'll make their way down this corridor and into Mr. Exeter's office, and that is where we'll be. Lopata, driving a panel truck, will be waiting outside. Now, we'll have sharpshooters on the roof and extra cars to block the streets, so we collar the two bad guys in this fourth-floor office and Lopata on the street. Walter: [Coughs] John: Chief Vadney will be in personal command, and I would like at this time to thank him for his help in planning this entire operation. [Whistle blows] [Tires screech] Exeter: Why have we stopped? Where are we? Uh, I don't understand. Eddie: Didn't the cops tell you? We're robbing your gallery, and you get to play on our team. Exeter: I will do no such thing. Eddie: Perhaps, we should discuss this with your wife. Walter: Freeze. Police. Aah! Hold it! Hold your fire! I'm hit! [Tires screech] [Tires screech] Walter: Lights! Get the lights! John: Get the lights. Idrissi, check those guys. Nuzat: They're dead. John: OK. Get the paramedics! Hold on, Chief. You're gonna be OK. They'll be here. Walter: [Gasping] Brendan: Um... John: Nice. Walter: Ugh, when I catch the idiot who did this, I'm gonna hang him up by his...ugh! [Siren] [Indistinct conversation] Man: Hey, come on. Come on. Clear the way through here. [Siren] Man: He ain't gonna make it. John: He ain't Eddie Lopata, either. Jerry: Rollings, you got real problems now. John: Relax, Donohoe. Your diamonds are safe and sound. Jerry: Yeah. Wrong. We just opened the safe. All the diamonds are gone. John: The Whitehall? Jerry: I said all the diamonds. John: Ohh... [Siren] [Tires screech] [Tires screech] John: Thanks. [Sighs] What the hell do you mean, you stole the diamonds? They were in your safe in your office in your building, and you're telling me you stole them? Exeter: I'm telling you, I had to. They had my wife as a hostage. They would have killed her. John: 3 men were killed tonight, and the chief of detectives was wounded. It's too bad you couldn't warn us before we went through this little song and dance. Exeter: When I returned here with the diamonds, they knocked me out with a pistol butt. My poor wife was gagged and bound to our bed. She couldn't move. When I came to, I managed to untie myself, and then I called the police. John: This the guy? Exeter: Yes. Brendan: Yeah. I got more good news. They ran a check on Tara's apartment. It's cleaned out. She's gone. John: My horoscope said this was gonna be a bad month, but... Brendan: OK. Man: Excuse me, nurse. Can you give us a report on Chief Vadney? I mean, how's he really doing? I mean, it is a serious... Man: You carved your name in stone tonight. You're gonna be famous. Brendan: Could have been one of you guys. Man: Nah. He was in your line of fire. Nuzat: It wasn't your fault. After all, the chief moved from his original position in total darkness. Ha ha ha! Brendan: I shot the chief in the keister, John. I shot him right in his big, fat... Man: That there. Yeah. Here he comes. Woman: All right. He's right here. Man: Doctor? Doctor: Chief Vadney is back in his room. He's conscious, and he's stable. Is there a Detective Rollings here? John: Here. Doctor: Chief Vadney would like to see you. Man: Detective? Woman: Detective? Sir? Doctor: Stay with me. Man: Yes. Wait. Can we just get one? Sir? Just one, please? [Clamoring continues] John: How you feeling, Chief? Walter: You gonna need 3 guesses, Rollings? John: We got an APB out on Lopata's Jag. Exeter and his wife are OK, but they're kind of beat up. Walter: And the Holden woman? John: Haven't you heard, sir? Walter: Yes. I just want to hear you say it. John: Gone. Building super saw her carrying a suitcase down around 1:00. Walter: Really? Uh! And are we surprised at this news, hmm? Do you have any idea about how the press is going to handle this, hmm? If I could get out of this bed, I would kick you right where your partner shot me. John: Yes, sir. Is there anything else? Walter: Yes. Get the hell out of here. Uh... [Gulls squawking] Brendan: Holden, Tara Marie... 5'10", 115 pounds, brown hair, hazel eyes...Lopata... Man: John, John, this just came in from Connecticut. They found your red Jag lying in the surf a little north of Greenwich, crack of dawn this morning, burned to a crisp, two bodies inside... one male, one female. Thanks. Brendan, let's go. [Snaps fingers] Brendan: All right. Yeah. Check all passenger manifests at JFK yesterday afternoon and evening. Right. Right. John: Brendan, are you with me, or what? Brendan: Yeah, yeah. I'm coming. Man: There must have been a real fireball, and I figure it come around that curve up there too fast and just kind of sailed on off, and it exploded with impact. Brendan: What about skid marks? Man: None. No. His foot didn't even hit the brake pedal. Yeah. We're gonna have to I.D. them with dental charts. Oh, they're a couple of real crispy critters. You should have seen them. John: Give me a break, huh? [Scoffs] [Sighs] Brandon... come here and take a look at this. Man: Oh, that sucker's got to be a full carat, maybe more. Brendan: And the rest of them are probably on this beach or washed out by the tide. Man: Yeah. Well, that car landed with terrific impact. They could be scattered all over. John: That'll do wonders for your tourist trade. Man: Hey, has he got a problem? Brendan: Yeah. What do you think Lopata did to her to make her fold on us like that? She seemed like she had it together. John: Everybody's got a breaking point. He found hers. She trusted me. Brendan: Hey, John, you don't get bonus points for guilt. What, do you think she'd still be alive if you hadn't got involved? Forget it. Lopata was gonna waste her, no matter what, and then ride off into the sunset. Now, you can believe that. You're gonna eat yourself up. Come on. Let's get out of here. Man: Chief Vadney, I see they took you off the IV. Does that mean you're getting better? Walter: Next question. Woman: Chief, we were given the impression that that stakeout was to have been an easy operation. Walter: Who told you that? I didn't say that. Man: That it wasn't easy, Chief? Walter: Easy? Of course it wasn't easy. If it would've been easy, I wouldn't be here. Woman: Well, has a medical report been released on you? Walter: You're a reporter. Ask the doctor. Woman: OK. What about the rumor you're going to be decorated? Is that true? Walter: Yes. Yes. That is correct. Yeah. The police commissioner is looking at a giving me the combat metal. Next, you in the back. Man: Chief, the department press release was rather vague about the nature of your injury. In layman's terms, just exactly where were you hit? Walter: In the northeast corner of the room between the desk in the safe. [Laughter] [Telephone rings] John: Yeah. Rollings, 21st. Yes. I was in charge of the operation, but I can't comment at this time. The investigation's still continuing. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Well, listen, sir. Frankly, you're wasting your time and mine. That's your idea of joke pal, I suggest you keep your smartass remarks to yourself. Yes. You may quote me. Vultures. Brendan: You might want your lawyer to check out some of these quotes by the chief. The only thing he doesn't blame you for a personally is Pearl Harbor. John: Told you this one would make me famous. So this is the Whitehall Diamond. Let's take a little ride. I'll drive. Brendan: Yeah. Be my guest. Man: I've seen your badges. I know you guys are NYPD, but Mr. Exeter's not gonna like this one damn bit. John: Yeah, Yeah. Keep your shirt on. Man: Yeah. I could lose my job. John: Tell you what, pal. You want to file a complaint with the commissioner, my badge number is 3026, OK? OK. The Whitehall Diamond has not been seen since 1939. How come she's got this photo? You miserable, lying, little... Eh... Woman: Be careful. He's in a foul humor. John: Ah. I'm glad his condition has improved. Walter: What's so important it couldn't keep, Rollings? John: I don't think Tara Holden was the helpless pawn of Eddie Lopata, sir. I think she set the whole thing up and he was working for her. Walter: Oh, please. Please. John: There is a photo of the Whitehall Diamond in her office in the gallery. It's a beautiful photograph in living color. Walter: OK. So? So what? John: Whitehall Diamond hasn't been seen publicly since 1939. Walter: Huh. John: How did she get the picture? Walter: I... John: Obviously, she had access to that diamond, sir, which means that she must have some connection with its owner Ruth Waring. The whole thing is starting to smell like an Insurance scam. Walter: An insurance scam? What are you talking about? John: Well, let's assume that the diamond is heavily insured. Now, this Ruth Waring arranges the auction, and she hires Tara to steal the diamond and bring it back. This way, Waring ends up with the diamond and the insurance money. Walter: Go on. Go on. But once Brendan and I stumbled into it, Tara knew she couldn't pull it off. We'd be watching her... unless she was a victim. If she could make us believe that she was working with us, she could still make it work. We'd even help her. Walter: That's it? Case closed? John: Not quite. What if it wasn't Tara Holden in that car? Walter: Oh. Oh. [Chuckles] Well, Rollings, it's gonna take many years for you to work the stink out of your clothes in this one. Yeah, I just had a report on the dental charts. They match perfectly. Yeah, the dead woman is definitely Tara Holden. Tara Holden. Definitely. Ah, close the door on your way out. Woman on P.A.: Dr. Adams, please contact Dr. Margolis. Brendan: Bad? John: The dental charts match. It was Tara. I tell you, you know, she's smart enough to figure this whole thing out and then she buys it in some corny car wreck. It's too pat. Bothers me. Brendan: OK, what're you thinking about? John: Well, the dead woman was Tara Holden, but maybe she wasn't our Tara Holden. What if she assumed the dead woman's I.D. from the get-go and all along her plan is to snuff the real Tara if something goes wrong? Cops don't chase dead women. Brendan: Yeah, and I can see you selling that to the chief. John: Idrissi's got a cousin who works at the morgue, doesn't he? Nuzat: What're you afraid of? We're all policemen. Man: This could get me in a lot of trouble. I could lose my job. You need a court order. Permission from next of kin. Nuzat: If I didn't stick my neck out for you, you'd still be peddling rugs in Syria. Cut. Man: Mm...the body is so badly charred. I can go directly to the chest cavity. Brendan: Ah, I'm gonna make a phone call. John: Sure. Man: Hmm. Your suspicions are correct. Once we're past the exterior charring, clean tissue. Pink as bubble gum. John: Thank you. Chief? Chief. [Chief mumbling] Oh, God, it's you. John: The dead woman was not our girl. Walter: What? What? Ohh... They've got a great psychiatric ward here, John. John: Chief, I've just come from the morgue. The dead woman was not a smoker. Walter: Hmm. John: Her lung section is clear as a bell and Tara or whatever her name is was a heavy smoker. The whole thing was a setup. Walter: Mmm-hmm. John: Chief, can we run this the last lap? Walter: Yeah, yeah. John: OK. She assumes the dead woman's identity and then after the heist, she kills the real Tara and Eddie Lopata. She stages the car crash, figuring we'll quit looking knowing that she's dead. She scatters a few small diamonds at the scene, just for dramatic effect. Now all the players are dead and she keeps the rest of the stones. Walter: Well, so we lost a few of the rocks, but we got the bad guys, and let's leave it at that. John: No, no, the lung section clearly shows... Walter: Oh, stuff the lung section. John: If I don't follow through on this, Chief, she'll get away with the whole thing. Walter: Hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm. John: OK. I'll cut you a deal. Walter: You'll cut me a deal? John: Yeah. You get me a Jane Doe fugitive warrant and clearance from Scotland Yard, I'll buy the plane ticket to London with my own money. [Chief chuckles] John: If I'm wrong, you get my badge. Walter: You'll take early retirement? John: That's right. Walter: How early? John: Immediately. Walter: Congratulations, John. You cut yourself a deal. John: Thank you, sir. Good night, Chief. Walter: Good-bye, Rollings. [Chuckling] John, voice-over: The anger I felt when I left New York had turned into jet lag by the time I landed in London. Just as well. Anger wasn't gonna help me. I was sure Tara Holden was still alive, but I didn't know where, so, my only move was to contact Ruth Waring, the owner of the Whitehall Diamond. [Horn honks] Woman: Detective Rollings? John: Yeah. Woman: Charlie Lawson. Detective Sergeant Charlotte Lawson. Scotland Yard. Me mates call me Charlie. I'm here to collect you. John: Hi, Charlie. John Rollings. How'd you know it was me? Charlie: I can spot a cop a mile away. What happened to your face? John: Turbulence. Charlie: Could have fooled me. We'd better get going. The chief super's waitin' to meet you. John: I can handle it. Charlie: Oh. We're here. You look flippin' awful. Come here. John: Aah! Charlie: I'd go electric, love. [Tires screech] The robbery's the talk of the yard. That bloke made flipping idiots out of your whole department, didn't he? Who was the genius who got sucked in then? John: Me. Charlie: Ha ha ha! I'm sorry. I'm afraid I've got a real knack for putting me foot in it. Our papers said the whole gang wound up dead, so, why come chasin' about over here? John: Following a hunch. On my own time and money. Charlie: Everyone was outraged when Miss Waring lost her diamond. She's quite famous over here in a small way. John: Mistress who made good. Charlie: Now, don't be cynical, Johnny. She's almost a national treasure. The Whitehall legend is one of our great love stories. I bet you're not too popular with your chief right now. John: I'm pretty sure he's crossed me off his Christmas list. Yeah. Charlie: We'll get on. The chief super hates my guts. Oh, hold on a minute. I got to change me shoes. John: Why? Charlie: My chief super would chew out my you know what if he caught me in these. I mean, why can't we wear comfortable shoes? I'd like to see him in a pair of these. Chief superintendent. Chief superintendent: Ah, Detective Rollings. Chief superintendent Kellogg. Marvelous man, your Chief Vadney. We worked together before in America. John: Ah, well, he sends his best, sir. Kellogg: Yes, I trust that he'll be out of hospital soon. It was a thigh wound, was it? John: More or less, yes. Kellogg: Rotten luck, this business. Shall we go? Oh, do join us, detective sergeant. I see you're wearing proper shoes. That's a refreshing change. Charlie: Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. Kellogg: This theory of yours is preposterous, detective. As I understand it, it was your incompetence that led to the theft of Miss Waring's diamond and now you come up with the extraordinary idea that she was behind the theft in order to collect the insurance? John: We have to examine every possibility. If I'm wrong, I will be happy to apologize to all involved. Kellogg: If it weren't for the regard and affection that I have for Chief Vadney, I'd put you on the first plane out of here. An insurance fraud? Ha, that's ridiculous. John: I just want to talk to her to establish a connection between her and Tara Holden. If, in fact, there is one. Kellogg: No, no, no. That's impossible. No, she's in no condition to be hounded or harassed. John: I realize she's 80 years old. I will be as gentle and diplomatic as possible. But if she is involved in any way... Kellogg: My God, you don't know, do you? John: I don't know what? Kellogg: Miss Waring suffered a massive coronary when she heard about the theft of the Whitehall. She's clinging on to life by a thread. Hmm. Knocks your theory into a cocked hat, doesn't it? John: I'm very sorry to hear it, but I would still like to continue my investigation... with your permission, of course. Kellogg: You're headstrong, aren't you, detective? John: Yes, sir. Kellogg: Very well. Detective Sergeant Lawson will continue as your liaison if that's all right with you. John: Yes, sir. Kellogg: I would remind you that you are a guest in this country, and I trust that you will conduct yourself accordingly. John: Understood, sir. [Door opens and closes] Charlie: I'll say this for you, Johnny. You've got a nerve. I would've told you about Miss Waring but I thought you knew. John: Question. Are you carrying? Charlie: Do I look it? John: No, I mean a gun. Charlie: Oh, we don't carry firearms. John: I feel naked without mine. I've never worked a case without it. Charlie: Oh, you'll get used to it. Right. Where do we begin? John: Uh, Ruth Waring's home. Charlie: Mm. It's a bit of a drive. It's near Epping Forest. But don't worry. I'll get you there in no time, love. John: I'll bet you will. Charlie: Times must be hard. No gateman, no groundskeepers. John: Yeah. Can see why she wanted to sell the diamond. Charlie: Oh, it's sad, really. She's like an old lady without her face on. John: Yeah. Listen, we forgot to get a search warrant. You people do use those, don't you? Charlie: Listen, you can't use the loo without one. That'll do. John: Don't you have to show due cause to get these? Charlie: There wasn't time, was there? John: Ah, this is just a shipping invoice for some furniture. Charlie: Just flash it, love. Nobody reads them. [Rings doorbell] John: Good afternoon. Butler: Good afternoon. Estate agents? Charlie: Police officers, sir. Butler: Oh, madam is not at home. She's taken ill. John: Yeah, we're very sorry, but we'd still like to come in. We'd like to talk to you. Butler: Well, I'm not sure that madam would approve. Charlie: Oh, I'm sure she wouldn't mind. We do have a warrant. Thank you. John: Yeah. Thanks. Charlie: Is there anyone else here, sir? Butler: No, I'm the last. Madam got rid of her maids a month ago and the cook just last week. It was a terrible ordeal for her. The loss of her diamond was the last straw. John: Yeah, what happened to all the furniture? Butler: Sold, sir. The whole lot to meet household expenses. But I feel as though I'm gossiping. John: Not at all. I'm gonna take a look around, if it's all right with you. I won't touch anything. I promise. Charlie: What happened here? I thought the old dear was rolling in money. Butler: Swindled by her solicitors. That's why you've come, isn't it? Charlie: Have you still got a kettle about? Cup of tea would be lovely. Butler: Yes, it would, wouldn't it? John: Thanks. Charlie: Poor, old Miss Waring. Artie says that when they... John: Artie? Charlie: That's the butler. Or that was the butler. Tomorrow's his last day. He said she wept for days over selling the Whitehall, but it couldn't be helped. That's all she had left. Furniture and silver gone. No buyers for the house. She spent it all. John: Yeah, but she is gonna get the insurance money, and if I'm right, the diamond as well. I think it's time we talk to Miss Waring herself. You know which hospital she's in. Charlie: It's close to London. But they won't let us see her. Intensive care, you know. John: You don't have any doctors' and nurses' uniforms in that little trick bag of yours? Charlie: If you'd have let me know. Ha ha ha! [Engine starts] Nurse: Not without permission from the doctor, and I don't care what kind of warrant you've got. John: Look, you're very dedicated. I admire that in the helping professions. We just wanna look in for a moment, kinda answer a question. Nurse: Look, I've told you, only with the doctor's permission. He'll be here within the hour if you want to wait. John: I'll wait. Charlie: I'm gonna go and have a cigarette. John: Sure. Just joking. Charlie: Excuse me. Do you have a light? Thanks a lot. Tara: You're very welcome. John: Mr. Kirby, are you telling me that Miss Waring is not belly up? Kirby: Belly up? John: Bankrupt? Kirby: Good Lord. Ruth Waring has more money than she could ever spend. Well over 6 million pounds, I dare say. John: I don't understand. Her butler says she's penniless. The maids, the groundskeepers have been cut loose. There's no furniture. Haven't you seen the house? Kirby: No. John: You haven't? Kirby: Miss Waring is a bit eccentric. She hasn't left her home in over 40 years. She doesn't hold with telephones. She communicates by mail only. John: Well, somebody set her up. Miss Waring thinks she's broke and that's why the Whitehall Diamond is up for sale. When did Miss Waring first contact you about arranging this auction? Kirby: First November last. We received a letter from her vehemently stating that the diamond was to be put up for auction immediately. We were all stunned, as the diamond was all that she had left of Sir Charles. John: Didn't you question her? Kirby: We did, sir. I even went so far as to ask her granddaughter. John: Granddaughter? I thought Miss Waring never married. Kirby: Oh, dear. I fear I've divulged a confidence. Charlie: Uh, this is official police business, sir. Fleet Street won't get hold of anything you tell us. Kirby: Miss Waring bore Sir Charles a daughter out of wedlock. In time, this daughter married, and Miss Waring became a grandmother. Then tragedy struck. The parents, her daughter and husband, were killed in an automobile crash. Today, Miss Waring's only family is her granddaughter Sarah Easton. When Miss Waring brought up the auction business, I contacted Sarah at once, but she assured me that Miss Waring was in complete command of her faculties. John: Mr. Kirby, how much does this Sarah Easton stand to inherit when her grandmother dies? Kirby: She's the sole heir. Charlie: I don't get it. Why pinch your granny's diamonds when she's bound to die soon and leave you everything anyway? John: Some people want it all at once. Now, this Sarah Easton is the only person close enough to Miss Waring to run this kind of con. I think we should talk to her. You got an address? Charlie: Sure. John: Great. Charlie: Thank you. John: Can't believe I'm saying this but all right, detective sergeant, step on it. Charlie: Ah, there it is. [Knocking on door] John: Miss Easton? Miss Sarah Easton? [Knocking on door] Hello? [Knocking on door] Charlie: Keep your eyes peeled. I use this to adjust me carburetor. Woman: Excuse me. What's going on? Charlie: Hold on. Police, mum. We do have a warrant to search these premises. Tell me, when was the last time you saw Miss Easton? Woman: Last evening. She's in trouble? Charlie: Thanks for your help, mum. Sorry to have bothered you. John: Tell you what. Charlie: That'll do nicely. Oh, no. If this is Sarah Easton, I bummed a light from her yesterday at the hospital. John: In New York, she called herself Tara Holden. Should have known. Charlie: That nosy, old bag downstairs has got the law on to us. Kellogg: I do not believe what is going on. Perhaps breaking and entering is all the rage with the New York police, but I will not stand for it! Charlie: Sir, all we were trying to do... John: Look, it was our only option at the moment. Now, I thought... Kellogg: You thought? I see no evidence of brains being used at all in this situation, and as for you, young lady, trying to pass off a furniture invoice for a legal warrant? Your actions are inexcusable. John: Sir, will you authorize a search of the Waring estate? Now, I know the diamonds are there. I didn't have that much chance to really search... Kellogg: All right. All right. We will search the estate and we better damn well find something. Rollings, are you satisfied? We have been through this place with a fine-tooth comb and we have found nothing. Do you know what your little adventure has cost the yard in man-hours? John: Well, I was sure we'd find them, sir. Kellogg: Well, from this point forward, you are removed from all participation in this case. I will call Chief Vadney and advise him. Ah, yes, detective sergeant. Your involvement with this man ends with your depositing him at his hotel. Is that clear? Charlie: Yes, sir. [Engine starts] I'm sorry, Johnny. [Knocking on door] Walter: Yeah? Woman: Detective Thomas is here, sir. Walter: Send him in. Brendan: Thank you. Sir? Walter: Oh, yes, the tail gunner. Do you have a passport, Thomas? Well, no, of course you don't. Go get one. You're going to London. Now. Brendan: London, sir? Walter: Yes, your partner is doing his damnedest over there to destroy my relationship with Scotland Yard. Go fetch him. Brendan: Yes, sir. Walter: And, Thomas, no sightseeing. Just collar him, put him on the plane, and tell him that I'm planning a swell retirement party for him. Go! John: Please let me buy you a dinner. Clerk: Mr. Rollings? Message for you, sir. John: Thank you. Well. Kellogg didn't waste any time calling Chief Vadney. My partner's on his way over to pick me up. He'll be here bright and early tomorrow. Clerk: You'll be checking out, then, sir? John: Don't push me. Charlie: Come on. I know a lovely spot for dinner. My treat. John: You know, this is the first decent grease I've had since I've been in this country. Thanks for hanging in with me, Charlie. Charlie: Mm. We shouldn't have come back here. And listen, if she shows tonight, there's nothing you or I can do. You know that? John: Yeah, I know that. I just want to see her. And I want her to see me. I was gonna go out proud. Cop that broke the biggest diamond heist in history. I'd like her to know that it was me that nailed her. Charlie: Revenge is a kind of wild justice. Bacon said that. He knew his stuff, didn't he? John: So, come on in. Let me buy you some breakfast. Charlie: Yeah, I could do with a bite. Thanks. Clerk: Mr. Rollings, there's a gentleman waiting for you. Brendan: Oh, don't tell me. Your watch stopped. You know, my clothes went out of style waiting for you at the airport. John: Well, it's nice to see you, too. Allow me to introduce my partner. Detective Sergeant Charlie Lawson. This is my partner... Detective Brendan Thomas. Charlie: Nice to meet you. Brendan: Likewise. Charlie: Johnny's told me all about you. Brendan: Thank you. John, look, I don't like this bounty hunter stuff any more than you do, but I'm not gonna push my luck with Vadney. Now, do me a favor and pack your things. We could still make the noon flight. John: Aren't you a little curious? Brendan: No. I assume you were right, as always. You can tell me on the plane. John, I shot that man in the behind. Don't make me rub salt in the wound, please. John: OK. Can I have a minute? Brendan: Yes. John: Thank you. Well, I guess this is it. Thanks for everything. We can't say we didn't try. Charlie: That's right. When we get her, and we will, I'll make sure she knows who nicked her, OK? John: You know, I'd partner with you anytime, anywhere. What're you gonna do? Charlie: I've got the day off. John: Well, drive carefully. [Both laugh] Charlie: Yeah, I will. John: I'll miss you. Charlie: Me, too. Take care. [Door closes] Brendan: Ahem. John: OK, warden, you got me. However, I believe I am entitled to a final meal before I walk that long mile. Brendan: OK, you buy, and we're not lingering over coffee. John: Absolutely right. Tara: Going down? Charlie: All the way. Brendan: Yeah, well, it stinks, John. You bust your butt nailing this thing down and the Brits come along and take all the headlines. John: Uh-huh. Brendan: Hey, but one thing. When they do get her, Vadney will never be able to retire you. Clerk: Mr. Rollings. Telephone. John: Thanks. Rollings. Yeah. You what? Hold on a second. Yeah, give me your pen. Yeah. Uh-huh. OK. Just slowly, one thing at a time, OK? Right. Yeah. A green Mercedes. Right. OK, you stay right where you are. We're on our way. And listen, if you were standing here right now, I would kiss you. Yeah. Charlie's got her. Brendan: Here we go again. John: Taxi! Charlie: No sign of the diamonds, Johnny, and I don't think you'll get her to talk. John: You want to bet? Get her out of the car. Brendan: Come on. John: Long time no see, Tara. Sarah: I'd much prefer Sarah, if you don't mind, John. John: Call me sentimental. Cuff her behind her back. You know, the way I figure this, we helped you pull this job, so, that kinda makes us partners, right? The only partners you got that aren't dead. Sarah: Isn't that a shame? John: The real shame is you're down to your last two choices. Now, you can give us the diamonds or you can take a double rap for homicide and spend the rest of your life in the joint. It's your choice. Sarah: Try again, John. This time something a bit more original. John: You made a fool out of me. I was one year short of retirement. Goin' out clean. I was a good cop... and you screwed that up, and I figured that's worth about 12 and a half million bucks. So, you can give me the diamonds, or I'm gonna take your teeth out. Charlie: Oh, don't... John: All right, now, shut up. Brendan: Hey, John, why don't you just... John: Back off, Brendan. Now, you give me the damn diamonds or I'm gonna mess up your face! Give me the diamonds! Sarah: I left the diamonds with a fence in Portobello Road. John: I would hate to think that you would lie to me. Put her in the car. Hey, I've been around the block a few times, but I can't figure this. You'd have inherited a fortune, clean and legal, once she died. Sarah: Which she should have done 10 years ago. A girl can't wait forever, John. John: So, you convince her that she's bankrupt, at least on paper, so she's gotta auction the stone. So she'll have money to survive. And then you tell her the insurance policy is lapsed. Sarah: You are clever, John. Bravo. But tell me, how did you get past the charred body that was positively identified as me? John: You smoke too much. Tara Holden didn't smoke at all. Who was she? Sarah: Eddie's girlfriend. She was with him over here last year. We met at a gambling club. I've always found the degenerate element a bit seductive. You kept me on my toes, didn't you, John? I kept having to improvise just to keep the plan alive. I do feel sorry about Tara now. Poor, stupid little thing. But shed no tears over Eddie. He was scum. John: I'll sleep better knowing that. John: Is that it? Sarah: Are these cuffs really necessary? John: Take them off. You know, it's a shame. You look good in chrome. No, no, come on. Now, I'm your new client. That's all he gets. Anything else and I'm taking you down. You understand? Sarah: I love it when you talk rough. John: Look, you keep that up, you're gonna earn that pop in the mouth, you understand? Sarah: Promise? Silly John. Do you really think I'd let a perfect stranger hold my family jewels? John: Aah! [Crash] [Shouts indistinctly] Charlie: Brendan! Charlie: Bloody hell! We'll never find her in this maze. [John breathing heavily] Brendan: I told you you gotta quit smoking that pipe. Charlie: Come on. Brendan: Scotland Yard will bust her, or Interpol. She's not gonna get away with it, John. Don't worry. John: She got away from me. Charlie: Oh, don't blame yourself, love. John: Ah, she didn't swallow the damn diamonds. They're somewhere on that estate. I just know it. Brendan: That's our flight. I have the tickets. I'm gonna make a call to New York and tell them we're on our way. Woman on P.A.: ...now boarding at gate 13. John: She wouldn't let a stranger hold the family jewels. You know, I know the diamonds are somewhere in that house. I just know it. Woman on P.A.: ...Rome, Athens, and Tel Aviv will be boarding in 10 minutes at gate 4. John: The pool. We never searched the pool. You could throw the diamonds in the pool, they'd sink right to the bottom, you could look right at 'em, you wouldn't know they were there. You take care of Brendan. I'm gonna get a taxi. Brendan: OK, we're all set. Where's John? [Whirring] [Whirring] [Exhaling] [Sputtering] [Gasping] [Gasping] [Gasping] Charlie: For heaven's sake, Johnny, what the hell do you think you're trying to do? [John gasping] [Car's engine starts] Brendan: Well, she took the Mercedes now. Someone left the keys in it. John: She got the diamonds again. What're we gonna do? Charlie: Call the police and let them pick her up. It's simple. John: Ah, she's too smart for that. She'll ditch the Mercedes, she'll try to pick up another car in the nearest village. Charlie: No, there's no such thing available. Brendan: Or she can call a taxi. Charlie: It's possible, if she can get one to come out this far. Brendan: Now what are we supposed to do? Walk? Charlie: I think I've got an idea. Brendan: Hey, what am I supposed to do? John: You're in great shape. Keep up the pace! [Sheep baa-ing] Charlie: There it is! Stop! Stop! John: Aah. Aah. Yeah? Charlie: She's taken the bloody keys. Brendan: Ohh. John: Come on, come on. Hurry up. Can you hotwire this car? Brendan: What? John: Can you hotwire this car?
