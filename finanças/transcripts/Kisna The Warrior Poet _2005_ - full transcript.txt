The sea, the earth and the sky.. ..are witnesses of the changing history. People changed. The country changed. What didn't change was true love. And one such true love was 'Kisna'. "Why did you destroy me?" "O Kisna." "Why did you destroy me?" "O Kisna." Kisna! Kisna! Kisna! Kisna! Kisna! Kisna! "Why did you destroy me?" Whenever India with it's one billion people celebrates.. ..it's Republic day there is always some special event. And this year the government and the entire media.. ..is focused on a special foreign personality.. ..whose name is Lady Catherine Williams. But the ironic part is that she neither wants to talk to.. ..any government personality nor with the media. She even stays away from the common photographers. Lady Catherine who is ex-minister in British Government.. ..is the official guest of our government. And I heard that Lady Catherine is about to.. ..donate 500 million pounds for the rural development of India. All the chief ministers of India are curious to invite her.. ..to their respective states. But Lady Catherine hasn't met anyone till now. She will meet them only after meeting.. ..the president and the prime minister. Today many ministers and big personalities of Delhi.. ..are present here. Everyone praised her at length. But Lady Catherine said only one word. - What's that? Greetings. - I too know what it means. Now we shall see who are the lucky ones who gets.. ..a share in Lady Catherine's 500 million pounds.. ..and also if anyone gets it or not. And one more thing is that Lady Catherine.. ..didn't accept the invitation of the tourism minister.. ..for the tour of India. Excuse me madam. May I have a sound byte please? Sorry sir, we have press meeting later. - Madam please. No interviews now. Sorry. Madam, this way. Please come. Vande! - Mataram! - Vande! - Mataram! Lady Catherine, this is Mr. Prasad from Ministry of Tourism. Madam, my name is Rajiv Prasad. Our sir sent me here. I understand. But why? Mr.Roderick, you please explain her. Madam has put our government in a.. ..very difficult position. - I can understand it. But why are you forcing her when she doesn't want.. ..to go anywhere. - Mr. Roderick, madam must go.. ..on the India tour. Please, tell him what I told you. Madam wants to know if you want to show her.. ..the real India? What does that mean? We have already invited her for tour of India. Please. Please explain. If you want to show her the real India.. ..then take her to one place and the name of that place is.. Devprayag. - Devprayag? Devprayag, a holy place in Uttaranchal.. ..where two rivers, Bhagirath and Alaknanda merge.. ..from where our sacred river Ganges originates.. ..above Rishikesh and Haridwar. So, what do you have to say? This is from our behalf. Greetings. - Greetings. Make sure you are always alert. Oh! You got here too. Excuse me madam. Just one question? Why have you selected this most neglected place to visit? Because this is the most neglected place. But then, this for me is India! Kisna. That was wonderful. May I? - Thank you. Good night and thank you again. Have you seen her attitude? I think either she doesn't know anything about India.. ..or she doesn't want to know. She is just pretending. I know.. I know India very well. I know it better than you. I know the real India. I am not pretending. There are thousands of stories to be told about India.. ..but I have only one story to tell. Now no one can stop me from telling this story. Can you see that bungalow over there? I guess it's a hotel now. That was my house, my birthplace. Lady Catherine is saying that the bungalow over there.. ..was her house, that's her birthday place. I was born here in 1930, in India. Before 1947 my father and my uncle were posted in India.. ..in the British government. My father was the deputy commissioner of Pauri Garhwal. But the villagers hated him. The land is fertile but serves efficiently.. ..tonight with loyalty. The fears of revolution may rage across the rest of the country.. Good morning. - Good morning. Catherine, where are you going? Please, change your clothes first. Please. Sriram. Sriram. Missi, dear. My dear. This is for you. Thank you. Where is Kisna? Kisna, same place where he usually is. There! Thank you. Kisna. Kisna. What I it? Kisna, I bought this gift for you. Gift? What did you get? Go away. I don't like this. Let me do my work. And here is your real present. What is it, now? Thank you. You look like a gentleman. Then salute me. Salute, sir. Do you take me as a fool? This is a girl's hat not guys. "Sing a song, which touches my heart." Kisna, father is calling you. He is calling all of you. It's the worship time. I can't come now. I am busy. Lakshmi, come with us. Huh! This, Catherine, now your turn, wow! This. This. Father. Father. - Yes. Kisna chases me away when Catherine comes. Is it so? No, he can't do anything like this. He does the same thing. Catherine ties hair like mine. She imitates me. My dear, Kisna's Radha. Indulge yourself in the world of dance and music.. ..and remember Kisna. Then see Kisna himself will come closer to you. Kisna doesn't care about me. I am here. Close your eyes. Turn to your south. Now open your eyes. Just see, who is here. Here is your Kisna. Tell me. Kisna, this is the English lesson book. Alright? By next Monday you have to read everything. Thank you, madam. Madam, I have also done my homework. Oh. That's good. Madam, may I enter your piano room? I want to see the Piano. - Definitely. Definitely. Thank you. - Come with me. Certainly not. No. You can't enter that house. No useless Indian can enter that house. Peter! No damn riff-raff! Peter! Not in front of children. - Don't indulge then. Not in my house. Do you understand, my dear? Every religion says the same thing. To walk on the path of love and peace. This is what written in the Gita too. What if someone doesn't follow this right? Then it's our duty to revolt against them. Revolt? Even if it's our masters? Even if it's your brother or master. It's our duty to revolt for justice. Have you heard it, Kisna? Shankar, don't have half knowledge of Gita. Understand it completely. Half knowledge is very dangerous. Did you get me? - Have you heard it, mother? It seems that my sister will make priests our of her kids.. ..by teaching them the morals of Gita.. ..when we need the soldiers to fight the British government.. Bhairav, you are there, the leader of the soldiers, right? Shankar is also walking on your path. - You are right. My Shankar is not the slave of British unlike you are Kisna. You started it again? Why do you fight on the same issue.. ..again and again? - You tell him, mother. Bracket has snatched the drinking water of the villagers.. ..and gave it to that evil prince Raghuraj. I will kill him some day even if he is your master. Who can stop your killing spree, Bhairav? Why don't you tell that Bracket have stopped all your.. ..illegal jobs? Now you are becoming the leader.. ..of the poor, and you are talking about of freedom? I know very well, what's on your mind. Here to here and here to here. Here is the Podigadwal town.. ..which belongs to my father Raja Pratap Singh. Mr. Becket, we've helped your government so much in earning money. We sent the wood of the jungle to your army through the river. Can't you protect our small lake? Bhairav's goons and the chief are using our water and you.. No one can dare to disobey my orders. Be sure, Prince Raghuraj. My police are looking after those docks. That is just the reassurance I wanted. Play the flute along with me like you were.. ..playing just now. - Okay. Wonderful. Great, Kisna. I have come to the conclusion that Catherine must go. Mr. Jones! Get Catherine's things ready. She is to leave for Delhi.. today. And now. Peter! - And now.. I don't want any arguments. 'My mother didn't have the courage to go against.. ..my father's decision.' 'That day I was sent to England.' 'But my childhood was filled with the memories.. ..and the smell of this land of this village.' 'After reaching England my aunt, Margaret.. ..admitted me in Siebel Institute.' 'But I did not forget Devprayag, Kisna and the villagers.' 'Many years passed by.' 'In 1947 the British Government.. ..promised Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru.. ..to give independence to India.' 'My father asked me to come to India on vacation.. ..as mother asked him to do.' 'On reaching India my happiness knew no bounds.' 'The same greenery, the same mountains, the same river.. ..the same people. I felt like I came back in time.' Hi Peter. Well thank you Prince Raghuraj. Catherine, now we are the members of the same family. All of them. Catherine. Catherine. Catherine. Where are you going? Sriram. Sriram. Sriram. - Baby Cathy. Did you recognise me? - How can I forget you? These flowers never let me forget you, dear. Sriram. - O, dear! How is Kisna? - He has become a young man. What does he do? - He passed the metric. And he also teaches the kids in the school. Does Kisna remember me? - Yes, but.. Sriram, what happened? Tell me. After you went everything changed here. The people, the government, love has disappeared. The fire of hatred is all over the places.. ..and especially against your father. Everywhere in India the fire of hatred is slowly quenching. But here it's burning with full force. And Kisna. Some mud is stuck even on the flowers. Lakshmi. - She is still crazy about Kisna. "I have Lord Shiva within. I have Lord Brahma within." "I have Lord Vishnu within. I have Lord Krishna within." "Then why should I go to temple." "Earth, sky, mountains, and oceans." "Wherever I see, I find him." "Then why should I go to temple." "I have Lord Shiva within. I have Lord Brahma within." "I have Lord Vishnu within. I have Lord Krishna within." "Then why should I go to temple." "Earth, sky, mountains, and oceans." "Then why should I go to temple." Hey, do you know Bracket's daughter is here. I heard that she is very beautiful. Will you marry her? Have you gone mad! Who will marry a white girl? Hey, Kisna, where are you going? I am coming, brother Shankar. Kisna. Did you recognise me? Yes. You are Miss. Catherine Bracket.. ..daughter of our master, Mr. Peter Bracket. I know it, Kisna. My father hasn't done the right thing. Your father told me everything. He me everything. Whatever happened is really a bad thing. Kisna, this politics.. ..means an end of our friendship? It shouldn't. Beautiful. Whose flute is this? Guess. Guess. It's mine, when your father.. When father sent me out of India, away from you. Away from all the friends. Where did you learn this tune from? The same way as you learnt the notes of my piano. Do you know, I have written a song on this tune? Really. - Yes. Now you speak good Hindi. - Definitely. Beautiful. - Outstanding. Do you remember this? You used to eat it when you're kid. Still you are eating like a kid. Give this flute to me. This is mine, isn't it? - But now it's mine. Okay, it's fine then. Listen to me, just see there.. Kisna, what's the song that you are writing? Will you hear it? - Definitely. "We're here, this moment together.. ..don't know what tomorrow holds.." "We may, may not come together. We may, may not see forever.." "This story of love will always be here.." "Which the earth and the sky will always hear.." "We're here, this moment together. Don't know what tomorrow holds.." "We may, may not come together. We may, may not see forever.." "This story of love will always be here.." "Which the earth and the sky will always hear.." Dear, I understand. I understand your pain. That girl came yesterday.. ... and today he is spending the whole day with her. He went to her as soon as he saw her.. ..as if he is with her for births. My dear, you are misunderstanding him. Okay fine, I'll think of something. Will you marry Kisna? Yes. Yes. My dear. Mother, is it true that I am getting married to.. - Lakshmi, dear. We all are very happy. - Mother, can I say something? I don't want to marry now. I have a lot of work to do for the school. Brother-in-law, do one thing, go to your elder brother and tell him.. ..to break the promise given to Dadaguru. No, dear. Dadaguru has given a token. You have to respect the words of elders. Day after tomorrow will be your engagement .. ..and the wedding in the coming month. Kisna! Let's go to the ground. Come on, hurry up. Uncle must be waiting for us. Prince Raghuraj, this is a lovely horse. I bought this horse just for you, so that every evening.. ..we could go on a ride behind those hills. Why did you buy this for me? - Because I love you, Catherine. I really love you. - But you are like my uncle? I am like your uncle, but I am not your uncle. I am mad about you, Catherine. Say yes to me just once. I will marry you. Please don't touch me. Catherine I love you. - I love you not. Bad luck, uncle. Catherine, good news. - Yes. Sriram, please. Dear Cathy, tomorrow is Kisna's engagement ceremony. - What? With Lakshmi. With Lakshmi? - Yes baby Cathy. Last night, Shastri came to our house with the proposal.. ..of Lakshmi's and Kisna's marriage. We agreed. What better thing could we ask for Kisna? Isn't it my dear? Congratulations Sriram. - Thank you very much madam. Sir, may I have the honour of the inviting you to.. ..the engagement ceremony function tomorrow? Of course, we will come. My father may be Deputy Commissioner. But we are your family Sriram. Apart from anything else it's my best friend's engagement. We'll be definitely be there. "Put henna on the fair one's hands.." "Make every part of her body fragrant with sandalwood paste.." "Adorn a jewel on the moon like forehead.." "Make her wear a bracelet studded with diamonds and pearls.." "Put henna on the fair one's hands.." "Make every part of her body fragrant with sandalwood paste.." "It has come, it has come.." "That day has come.." "I've been waiting for this day all my life.. ..to be with you, my love." "My love.. my love.. my love.." "My love.." "As fresh as a flower.. ..this girl is soon to be a bride." "Her lips look lovely red." "My girl's looking exquisite.." "Like morning sunrays through clouds so blue." "The moment your bridegroom will look at you.." "He'll fall in love with you." "The most awaited day is here." "The day when your charming bride to be is entering our lives.." "Beloved is everywhere." "I welcome my love.." "I welcome my love.." "I cannot stop my heart.." "I cannot stop my heart.." "I'm crazy about him.." "I went crazy for him, the body was swaying, the heart was crying.." "I went crazy for him, the body was swaying, the heart was crying.." "There is a fire in my heart and body.." "Every part of the body is melting gradually.." "I am being overcome by color, gradually.." "My lips are burning, what kind of thirst has been aroused.." "Has been aroused, has been aroused.." "The eyes have become foggy and there's fire in the heart.." "There's fire, there's fire.." "What kind of storm is there in the breath, what kind of a cyclone.." "There is restlessness and a rising desire.." "It has come, that day has come.." "I've been counting days for this day.." "O my beloved.." "I welcome my love.." "O my beloved.." "The handsome groom of the beautiful bride.." "Diamonds, pearls, emeralds look cheap compared to you.." "Become like Krishna and take away the sorrows of all around you.." "May you be blessed with abundant wealth.." "The handsome groom of the beautiful bride.." "Diamonds, pearls, emeralds look cheap compared to you.." "O Kisna, my Kisna.." "O Kisna.." "My Kisna.." "O my beloved." I've never seen anything like that. What was all that for? I think you embarrassed everyone. You danced and shouted out so loud! 'That night my mother was very upset with me.' 'I told her that Kisna is my friend, my best friend.' 'Then mother said that he was my friend, but he isn't now.' 'Right now he is Lakshmi's fianc.' 'He will get married to Lakshmi.' 'No one likes our friendship anymore, not even Lakshmi.' 'Mother said that we belong to different families.' 'And that the whole country was burning.. ..in the fire of hatred against British.. ..and it will keep on burning till we leave this country.' Turn it. Good. Hold it tight. Look into the eyes, this way, yes, right. Raise it. Good. Now charge. Come on. Brother, can I do it tomorrow? - No excuses, just charge. Brother, I will do it with Gharan. What can I do? I am unable to raise my sword on you. Gharan, teach this fool. And he wants to be a warrior. Phumkara. Every week about 2-3 people used to die.. ..due to drinking the water of the pond.. ..but this week 5 persons died, 5 persons. When will that day come in this province.. ..when a Bhagat Singh will be born.. ..who will teach a lesson to these foreigners. I am not Bhagat Singh.. ..but I am Shankar Singh. Commissioner Beckett.. - Down, down. Commissioner Beckett.. - Down, down. Commissioner Beckett.. - Down, down. Commissioner Beckett.. - Down, down. Commissioner Beckett.. - Down, down. Commissioner Beckett.. - Down, down. Commissioner, see these five dead bodies. Among them there are three men, a kid, and an old lady. And all of them died because of the alms you gave to us.. ..due to drinking the dirty water of that dirty. So what can I do? - You need not to anything. Now we will do whatever is there to be done, Mr. Bracket. From today onwards, we will keep burning the dead bodies.. ..of the people who died due to that pond and due to disease.. ..outside your office, right here, Phumkara. Stop this! Guards! Guards! Stop these wild dogs! Hey. Fire. Guard, fire. Father. Commissioner Beckett.. Down, down. Commissioner Beckett.. - Down, down. Commissioner Beckett.. - Down, down. Bhairav Singh, you were the one who.. ..killed those five villagers by poisoning them. You raised a commotion of revolutionaries against Beckett. What do you want? 50 acres of land on my name. Shivcharan, revolution is not my target, but my business. Explain Beckett. - Beckett wants to imprison you. He has lot evidence against you. This is the external service of the BBC, 4th of June 1947. On the morning of 4th June of 1947, Lord Mountbatten.. ..announced the final decision of British Government. On 15th August India will be handed over to the Indians. And all English officers had to hand over their officers.. ..to the Indians and leave India by 14th August. Meeting. During this time plans were also made about.. ..separate Pakistan for Muslim-living people. Lord Mountbatten and Gandhi along with.. ..Sardar Patel, Mr. Jinnah, and Jawaharlal Nehru had a meeting. Yes, I heard it in our sir's radio, the BBC news. Who is there? Help! I hope no one is aware of our plan. Come on! Mrs. Jones. Mother. - Suzie where are you? Come on, hurry up. Catherine! Hail Mother Bhavani. Peter! No! Catherine. Catherine. Catherine. Catherine. They.. burnt my house.. ..and they.. Catherine. Please. My father and mother. Did you find Kisna? - I searched the whole village.. ..but I didn't find Kisna, and Phumkara is still unconscious. He went against Phumkara in spite of being my brother. You do one thing. Go and search for her. Nab them. I am coming too. The Commissioner's house is on fire. What will happen to him? Don't cry. Everything will be fine. Kisna, the question that is there in your eyes.. ..also has the answer right there. Since you were a kid you have been reading in Gita.. ..to save innocent helpless women. Not only worshipping idol, but this is also their duty. And what about brother? - So what? It doesn't matter if it's your brother or it's my brother. There has been injustice, wasn't there? It's our duty to fight against injustice, Kisna. And you have to do that justice on this girl. I am with you. My blessings are with you. Send this girl to England or to Delhi. It's my order. Mother, where are you? - Yes, I am coming. "Hail Lord Brahma." "Hail Lord Brahma." "Hail Lord Brahma." "Hail Lord Brahma." "Hail Lord Brahma." "Hail Lord Brahma." "Hail Lord Brahma." "Hail Lord Brahma." Lakshmi, I saw him going along with her. Didn't I tell you that he is marrying you just because of.. ..the pressure from his family? Actually he loves Catherine. He eloped with her. What are you saying, mother! He didn't even ask you before leaving.. ..and he took such a big risk. Now I don't know what's right and what's wrong anymore. But I know one thing that only one of your two sons.. ..will remain alive. - No, son. Pray for whom you want to pray. Shankar. Does your Kisna wants us to be hanged? Hey Nandu, sing your song. "Sing a song that touches my heart." "Let's decide whose songs are better." "I'll sing such songs that you'll have to agree.." "That my songs are better than any song can be." "Sing a song that touches my heart." Look, Kisna, people from your village came to me.. ..and enquired about you and went towards Haridwar. I thought that you will come to me. That's why I am thinking that I should stay in your house.. ..for a few days and then I will leave. - In my house? No, my in-laws are Brahmans, my wife and yours eloping.. No. No. You want me to be thrown out of the house. Nandu, I've a plan with which I can stay at your house.. ..and also no one will throw you out of the house. What's that? Mother, have you heard it last year Sriram came.. ..on the day of Sriram's birthday and today.. ..Kisna is coming in Srikrishna's worship. Mother. Here he is. "Hail Krishna." "Hail Krishna. Hail Ram." He? "Hail Ram." The guests are Gods, aren't they, mother? O, she is so beautiful. She is so fair, she has grey hair. She looks just like a foreigner. - She is a foreigner. I see. - Did you see that? Greetings, aunt. - God bless you! Touch her feet. Oh.. mother, are you hurt? I am so sorry. It's ok, she is just married. She doesn't know touching feet.. I am sorry. She will learn it soon. - She will learn it. She will learn it. Trust him she is saying he will learn it. It's a love-marriage. She is daughter of an English officer.. ..and he is son of an Indian officer. That's why both got married. Her British father went back to England. But she has become completely Indian lady. Am I right? This is what you told me, didn't you? - Right. And her name is Gangotri, isn't it? Yes. And by the way how many days they will stay here? Two days. - Rukmini. Yes. - Come. Take father's blessings. You too come. "Hail Ram." My respects to you. - Bless you. Touch the feet. - Give the box to me. God bless you! He is Mr. Sitaram. "Come." "Mother of Lord Krishna." "Hail Krishna." Take this, girl. May God give you a baby boy soon. Hail Krishna. Elders bless like that. Hail Rama. Rukmini, they came from a long distance. Why don't you give them your room? I am giving everything to them. My clothes, my room.. Am I right? And also we are habituated to sleep on terrace. Aren't we? Gangotri, Krishna. I thought you went to sleep. Milk! Why milk? - Why milk? Kisna, didn't you teach her anything at all? Sister-in-law, why don't you teach her a few things? Gangotri, milk is given to the newly-wed couples.. ..so that they could.. - Yes. So that they could become strong and then.. ..give birth to strong children. - With just one glass of milk? Yes, it happens. Strong and beautiful children are born. Kisna, teach her something. You are also just.. Nandu, where are you? I need to talk to you. What a strange thing! - It's a part of our tradition. You leave it. Shall we drink milk? - What! We will drink milk. - You keep quiet and let me sleep. Don't trouble yourself too much. I feel like drinking milk. - Why? Just like that, not for having kids. Tell him. - You tell him. Sir, superintendent is saying that he didn't find out.. ..Catherine, but we can find out Jennifer if you.. I don't want Jennifer, but I want Catherine. Catherine is my dream. Find her out within 24 hours. Did you get me? - Yes, sir. Get out now. But your highness, promised me to make your queen. Come, today I will fulfill your dream. Jivanlal, find out Catherine or else your life will be hell. Kisna, who are they? - They? They are a Hindu family who are offering the ashes.. ..of their near one's to the river Ganges. - For what? So that his soul rests in peace. - And? And so that his last wishes will be fulfilled.. ..that weren't fulfilled in his life. - Wow! Do you have any wish? Kisna. Didn't I tell you grandpa, he is trapped in that girl's magic.. ..since childhood. He eloped with that girl.. ..and caused enmity with his family. Dear, I shall tell you something? - What? There is a little impurity in your love. - Impurity. Why? I will explain it. There is no trust in your love. Trust, patience and sacrifice are the pillars of true love.. ..but not envy. - Yes, there is envy in my love. Where there is love there is envy. You always support Kisna. I feel like you are not.. ..my grandpa, but you are his grandpa. I am always the wrong one. So, while worshipping river Ganges, these flowers.. Cover yourself. What happened? - Turn that way. Come. I am telling the truth, brother Shankar. Kisna didn't come here. If he had come here.. ..I would have explained it to him that things are well. Ok, then. But keep an eye on him. When he comes, tell him that he insulted.. ..his brother, uncle, and the whole family.. ..that he has done injustice to us. That pig has put all of in trouble as well as.. ..he put himself in trouble.. ..that too for a British girl? He hasn't done the right thing. Inform uncle Shambhu if he comes here. He will inform us. Let's go. - Ok. Pray to the God that I wouldn't have to face brother. I can do anything, but not fight with my brother. I can understand you. But forget all these things now. Stay one more day here, so that they go farther. And also today it's Srikrishna's birth anniversary. And we have a lot of work to do. What do you say? Mr. Poet, have you written any new song for the dance? I wrote a song in the tune that you were just humming. I was thinking just about this. Rukmini, wait. I found a new song. Kisna, what's the song that you have written? I wrote a song on Radha and Krishna. Who is Radha and Krishna? - Radha and Krishna? Cathy, in India every girl in love is seen as Radha.. ..and every boy in love is seen as Krishna. Can we go to watch the dance? No, Cathy. We can't go anywhere. But I will show your dance right here. Ok? Okay. "He is colorful, He is handsome.." "He is mischievous, he is the shore of the Yamuna.." "He plays, He plays the flute, He dances with the maids.." "He is the flute-player, the dancer, He is the handsome.." "The one who is unique, with intoxicating eyes.." "One about whom every girl in Brij is crazy.." "That's Kisna.." "That's Kisna.." "That's Kisna.." "That's Kisna.." "That's Kisna.." "The One who is unique, with intoxicating eyes.." "One about whom every girl in Brij is crazy.." "That's Kisna.." "That's Kisna.." "That's Kisna.." "That's Kisna.." "She's deeply in love.." "She's sleepless in love." "She's deeply in love, she's sleepless in love.." "She's unaware of the world. They say she's head over heels in love.." "On meeting Kisna, she forgets every other bond in life.." "She just chants his name all the time." "There is Kisna in her heartbeat and her breaths.." "Lives every moment of her life for Kisna.." "That's Radha.." "That's Radha.." "That's Radha.." "That's Radha.." "O Shyam.." "O Shyam.." "The anklet makes a tinkling sound.." "The anklet makes a tinkling sound.." "The anklet makes a tinkling sound.." "She's beautiful, she is fair.." "She's beautiful in all ways by heart, face and mind.." "Her love for Kisna is deeper than the ocean.." "That's Radha.." "That's Radha.." "That's Radha.." "That's Radha.." "The One who is unique, with intoxicating eyes.." "One about whom every girl in Brij is crazy.." "That's Kisna.." "That's Kisna.." "That's Kisna.." "That's Kisna.." "There is Kisna in her heartbeat and her breaths.." "Lives every moment of her life for Kisna.." "That's Radha.." "That's Radha.." "That's Radha.." "That's Radha.." "The one who is unique, with intoxicating eyes. - That's Kisna.." "The One who is unique, with intoxicating eyes. Bhairav and brother Shankar, men have reached Faisabad.. ..which is away from Haridwar and they are searching.. ..both of you over there. Then we should reach Haridwar railway station.. ..and board the train for Delhi in the morning. You go there in the bus and Cathy and I will reach station.. ..on the cart. - I too was thinking the same. You got scared, didn't you? - Yes. But are you alright? - Yes. Today you are leaving, aren't you? That's why I brought this sari and shawl. - Thank you. Now tell me what did you like most in Hrishikesh? The Ganges.. - Ganges. Lord Krishna. - Lord Krishna. - And.. You. - What! Me? Why? Your love, your sacrifice. - What have I sacrificed? Your bedroom, your clothes, you gave me everything. But what's so special in it? - For me it's very special. In our country no one showers love in this way. No one sacrifices like this for a stranger. This is India. This is what is the tradition of this place. That's why I love India so much. And I am very sad that I am leaving. I know why you are leaving. - How did you know? My husband, Nandu is not good at lying.. That's why I knew it since beginning that.. ..you and Kisna are not husband and wife. And Kisna is taking you to your home, your country. And that's why I was quiet, because they are doing.. ..a good thing. Isn't it? But you stayed with us just like an Indian. I liked that a lot. But now I am feeling very bad. I am feeling like my sister is leaving me forever. - Rukmini. You are so nice. I will never forget you. You shouldn't cry while leaving. Stop crying. "I am restless without you." "I am restless without you." "Son of Brij." "I am restless without you." "Son of Brij." "I am restless without you." "I am restless without you." "Son of Brij." "I am restless without you." Sir, we've reached the station. "Son of Brij." You stay right here. I'll get tickets, alright? Can I get two tickets for Delhi? - Yes. Excuse me. - Yes? Miss Catherine. - Yes. Your mother is waiting for you. - My mother! Yes. - Where is she? She is here. In the car. Catherine. - Mother! Mother! - Come fast. Come on. I am so worried. This for your ticket. Oh, dear. Let's go. My baby. Stop the car. - No. - He saved me, mother. He's trying to get me to Delhi. - Stop it, Catherine. For goodness sake. We can't trust any one just now. Kisna. Kisna. Catherine. Stop the car. Leave me. I can't leave him. - Catherine. He is one for me. What's the matter with you? - Catherine! Driver, stop the car. - No. Catherine! Kisna. What have you done? If you had informed me earlier I would have found a way out. A huge war like the Mahabharata will begin between the brothers. Your ruthless brother Bhairo's sworn to get them killed! And do you know? Even Lakshmi has left in search of Kisna with Vasu. She's crazy.. absolutely crazy! "Tell me something.." "Tell me something.." "I discover something new in you.. "Every time. Either you blush or you tease.." "Why so different all the time.." "Tell me one thing." "Why are you so crazy.." "Whenever I meet you my heart misses a beat." "Why do you play hide and seek with me?" "Sometimes you tell me." "Tell me one thing. Why are you so crazy.." "When you look out for me the strands of hair fly across your face.." "When you look out for me the strands of hair fly across your face.." "The relationship between the eyes.." "The relationship between the eyes.." "Why does it break after being strengthened.." "Your eyes tease and invite at the same time.." "These eyes are bound to make you feel restless.." "Why does my heart swell with love." "Tell me one thing, why are you so crazy.." "Grain over a grain.." "Please come back, my love!" Is it true that Kisna stayed at your place with that foreigner? Why can't they stay? We both are childhood friends. But.. - But, I'll tell you about them. They both are enjoying. We gave them a separate room. They stayed like married couples. - Together? Yes, together. Same as Radha and Krishna. Catherine was looking like Radha. Do you know, she took bath in Ganges? Right there. Where did they both go now? They both left the day before yesterday.. No, I will not tell you. They warned me not to tell. Just because you are teacher's daughter, I told you.. ..or I wouldn't have. I think you are unaware of the fact that I am Kisna's would-be wife. What? See, I have chalked out the route to Delhi. But Kisna, but she has found her mother. So what's there to worry now? That idiot Prince was also with them. And with him Catherine is in an even greater danger. Kisna, on this spot is a guest house of a prince.. It could be his. Tikampur. You stay here.. I may get back to you if needed. This is disgusting. Absolutely disgusting. This is a breach of faith. This is betrayal. Is it betrayal to tell the truth? I am only saying that I want to marry Catherine. I want to protect her from all troubles. Shame. Shame on you. She's your friend's daughter! It is life, Jennifer. Relationships do change. Don't you trust me? No. Now I don't trust any Indian. I am British. My mother was British. My father had two wives. You are neither British nor Indian. You are a street dog. You look angry. But.. Who's there? My respects to your highness! - Kisna. I'm Kisna. How did you get here? I'm their servant's son. My mother sent me to protect them. I like your intentions and thoughts. Welcome, loyal son of servant! Thanks my lord! Can I sit here? Sit on my head.. I can't commit such a blunder. A chair will do.. Thank you. I'm very hungry! Eat as much as you want. How do you intend taking my fiance away from me! Sir, my mother says the rich have lots. Money, strength, army, servants. Everything. But the poor fight the corrupt rich with just one asset. What's that? A determination. And you're determined to fight me? Yes. - Here? Absolutely! Now? - Yes. How? Like this. Raja! Let's go ma'am! Come on. Come on. Raja! Come on. Raja! - What happened, your highness? Catch them, you idiot! Kisna. Should I call a doctor? - Shut up. Fire! Fire you petite sir. Looks like your aim has gone bad! Get out from here! You've the fate of a loser! Your fortune is standing before you. And you are blotting it by pointing a gun? That too in this state! "Who did this to you?" Who are you? - Me? Have you heard of the cuckoo of India, the darling of North India.. ..the famous courtesan Of Lucknow, Naima Begum? She's the prince's.. ..queen of dreams! I'm her favorite aide. My name's Jumman Masum Kishti. Here's a letter for the prince from Naima Begum. What letter? Idiot! I'll explain! Naima Begum is performing tonight at the palace of Nawab Shaukat. A celebration to woo the beauty Naima Begum. Let's see where the lightning strikes. Here's the letter for him. Ask him if he can come or not. The prince isn't keeping well. Just mention Naima Begum. He'll feel better in no time. But you are? Visit any colourful lane of Lucknow and mention my name.. ..Jumman Masum Kishti. They'll kiss your hand! Is that so? - But wear your pants.. A few rogues still hang around! Here's the letter for the prince. Okay, I'll deliver this message.. - Straight to him. It's up to him if he wants to come! Come on Ali. I have hopes in my heart.. ..of finding your love. I have hopes in my heart.. I heard that they are going to Faizabad. Uncle, Kisna is going to Faizabad. On our way to Delhi, Jumman Uncle! Uncle's nephew, get down! I did see you getting into my vehicle.. I understood that you were.. ..escaping from the Raghuraj. I thought let them go. I'll sort it out later. Get down. You were right, uncle Jumman. Now.. These two homeless women.. and I.. ..only you can save their lives. Me? From every lane of Lucknow to Delhi's streets.. ..Jumman Masum Kishti's anecdotes are well known. I've been an idiot all my life, where did you hear of my good deeds? He's charming you! Yes, I know! We charm the gods too in times of crisis, right? Uncle Jumman, am I right. Charming.. okay charm me. Tell me your tale. If your tale is genuine, then I'll help you.. ..or else I'll leave you on the way. I have to go to Faizabad. I understood your story. There are sorrows, as well as there is truth. And boy.. Yes. - Explain it to them that they have to do what I say. - Yes. First of all, I will take them to servant quarters. The quarters that is there in the Nawab sir. After that what God wishes will happen. Explain it to them in English. - We understood you, Jumman. You didn't tell me that they understand Bengali. Unnecessarily, I was blabbering. Thank god I didn't speak anything vulgar. Madam, I also speak English little-little. - Great. Tonight there is a party organized on the occasion.. ..of Mr. Nawab's fourth wife's welcoming. I am taking you there, but thee are two problems. The first one is that Mr. Nawab hates English people a lot. And the second problem is that that culprit.. ..prince Raghuraj comes at any time. Yes, there is one solution. Naima Begum. You don't worry. Tomorrow morning you will be in Delhi. Keep it in mind. Take care of the guests. Jumman, where were you? Everyone was searching you. Madam, I am searching myself. She is first wife of Nawab Aktar of Azamgarh's, Saira. And she is their daughter, Nazma.. ..and he is their son-in-law, Mr. Aslam. Naima Begam's guests are also our guests. You must take care of the guests. Did you get me? Yes. - Ok, I am coming Salma. Excuse me. You need not to worry. Brother Jumman, where is Naima Begum. Wait for a moment. Let me go and see how is her mood. You need not to worry. Is this a safe place? - I hope so. Naima Begum. - Jumman, today your voice is different. No, it's just.. - What's that tune in your voice.. ..that I am not acquaint with? - You are right. You want to give them shelter in my name, don't you? Yes, Naima Begum. - What's there to hide in that? That's nice. - Actually Naima Begum, they are in trouble. Yes, I heard about them. Go and bring them to me. As you wish. Listen. - Yes, sir. Where are the guests who were here. - I don't know, sir. Welcome. Welcome. Mr. Nawab. - It's our good-fortune. It's Allah's grace that you came here tonight. Now I am here. We shall start the ceremony. Naima Begum asked if Prince Raghuraj came here. It's her love, Mr. Nawab, which brought me here. What happened to your eye? - It's just one eye, Mr. Nawab. Even if both my eyes were damaged.. ..I would have still come here for Naima Begum. And she is.. - She is my new wife, Husna. Salutations. - Salutations. You are very lucky, Mr. Nawan. Honestly. Come. Let's go inside. Hey, Ali. Where is elder madam? Elder madam took them to the place where women sits. And where is he? - She gave him a good seat too. We are in trouble. Call him. Naima Begum, elder madam has made them sit.. ..in different places. - So what? The problem is that prince Raghuraj is also here. Jumman, what's the fun when there aren't.. ..enemies between the lovers. - Naima Begum! You sing for lovers from your heart.. I will take care of the rest. Go. "Strange is thou veil, you are always behind it.." "Neither you hide, nor you appear.." "Listen." "The veil, the veil.." "The veil, the veil.." "The veil won't lift.." "This veil will not let you see this beauty." "This veil will not let you see this beauty." "Listen." "Listen." "The veil.." "Won't lift.." "This veil will not let you.. ..see this beauty." "Listen, this veil." "Won't lift.." "This veil will not let you see this beauty." "No matter if you are in veil.. ..the light will be visible." "The glow will come to the lovers, it won't stop.." "Listen." "This veil.." "Won't lift.." "This veil will not let you.. ..see this beauty." "Listen, listen.." "Listen, listen.." "Listen, listen.." "Listen, listen.."

"Heartbeat, heartbeat.." "The beats of my heart will echo there.." "The beats of my heart will echo there.." "You are on that side of the veil. But your glow will come filtering through.." "To the lovers, it won't stop.." Prince, if you want to win a woman's heart.. ..then win it with heart, but what's this? Naima Begum, it's our personal matter. You go aside. What if I don't go aside? It will be a really interesting thing. My lover will be my murderer? Take away my life, but save your life first. Turn back and see. Kisna. Oh, these weapons! Thank you, Kisna. Now he is with me and you are free. Naima's prayers and Allah both are with you.. ..in your journey. - Thank you, Naima Begum. Welcome. Kisna, you shall go. Jumman is waiting for you outside. Thank you, Naima Begum. What's this, Prince? You .. .. shouldn't see everyone with the same eye. Mother, it's beautiful. - It's yours. No one will stop us in Naima Begum's cart. Now you will soon reach your country. Thank you. - Here is the food and water. Come. Sit. Start soon. Thank you, Jumman. Thank you. Thank you. - It's enough. Madam, India might be a poor country.. ..but the hearts of Indians is very large. We survive with love, even if we don't have food. What do you say, Kisna? For us love is love is love is love. What's this? You are crying? "Don't forget your childhood friend." "Don't let the people laugh at you." "Don't let them mock you." "We're here in this moment." "Come on." Come on. Kisna. Move. Come on, pull ahead son. Jumman. Cathy. - Cathy. Kisna! Mother! Cathy. - Don't worry. Our Kisna is there. Kisna. Madhav. Kisna! Kisna! Madhav. Catherine! Catherine! Catherine wait! Kisna! Kisna! - Catherine! Don't stop, keep walking. Catherine! Catch her. Find her. We will search for your mother tomorrow morning. You are worrying that I will die, aren't you? No, I won't. Stop talking. Go to sleep. Uncle, they are hiding.. ..somewhere around in this jungle. "Come, let me feel you with my arms again.." "Softly you whisper, you are my life, my best friend.." "Just a moment is what I've been searching for. Just a moment in love with you.." "A moment so special, so beautiful.." "In a moment a wish comes true.." "Save me from the future, take me back in time.." "Words, they have no meaning without you in my life.." "Let me walk the rainbow to the times of sweet surprise.." "To the moment when I was a little girl that had you in my life.." "Time has no words or for words left unsaid.." "For words have no meaning, there's no road ahead.." "Just a moment is what I've been searching for.." "Just a moment in love with you.." "A moment so special, so beautiful.." "In a moment a wish comes true.." "I'm looking for a reason to smile once again.." "In every change of season, a feeling I can't explain.." "I see the magic all around, shining over me.." "With you my life could be so right, if only it could be.." "May be this world is a mystery to me.." "May be this world is a mystery to me.." "But if you could be here for eternity.." "Just a moment is what I've been searching for.." "A moment in love with you.." "A moment so special, so beautiful.." "In a moment a wish comes true.." "Just a moment is what I've been searching for.." "A moment in love with you.." "A moment so special, so beautiful.." "In a moment a wish comes true.." "My wish comes true.." "We're here, this moment together.." "Don't know what tomorrow holds.." "We may, may not come together.." "We may, may not see forever.." "This story of love will always be here.." "Which the earth and the sky will always hear.." Lakshmi. - I saw people dying.. ..but I am seeing myself dying for the first time. Lakshmi, don't misunderstand us. Do you think I am blind? I was mad that I attached.. ..every moment of my life with you and you.. And what have you given to me except betrayal? This is not betrayal, but it's my duty. Going away from your fiance and cuddling a white lady.. ..in this lonely jungle is your duty? Stop it, Lakshmi. Stop it. Don't say one more word. You are about to be my wife. And I expect my future wife to support me in this test. I have to take Catherine to Delhi to their people.. ..even if I have to fight anyone. This is my duty as well as my mother's orders. I want to know what was your mother thinking.. ..when your mother gave this order. She pushed my future husband into this dark well.. ..without telling me. Tomorrow I am going to marry you.. ..but not she. You call it a justice to leave your wife.. ..for helping some other lady? I am asking you. I am asking your mother. Lakshmi, you mind has shattered in anger. Yes, it has shattered. - Listen. Listen. Whatever you want to say, you may say.. But right now I am with Catherine and I'll be with her. Then stay with her and die for her. From today onwards you and I don't have any relationship. I am going now. And I will never return to you.. ..and you too never come to me. - Lakshmi. But remember one thing, my curse will be with both of you. You will never stay in peace, never. Lakshmi. Lakshmi, listen to me. Kisna, whatever Lakshmi said is right. Please, you go back to Lakshmi. Please. It's my wish where I have to go. Don't try to tell me what's right and what's wrong. She is right. You are right. So am I the one who is wrong? I will fulfill the decision that I have taken. Did you get me? Don't try to peach me. It's my wish if I want to live or die. Catherine. Catherine. Catherine. Catherine. Catherine. Catherine. Listen to me. Catherine, where are you? Catherine. Listen to me. Look, Shankar, today my student is carrying.. ..the blood-coated sword against me. Why is there blood on this sword, uncle? You would've understood it by now. Do you know, she is our enemy's daughter? But she is not our enemy. She is a foreigner. - She is a girl. Will you betray your relationship with your brother and uncle for her? I will be a sinner then. Then, hand over her to us. Then I will be a big sinner. So you think that you are Arjun of Mahabharata? You will fight against your brother. No, uncle. I am just Kisna. Son of Shantadevi and Sriram, Kisna. Brother of Shankar, your nephew, Kisna. And you will fight against us. - No. But I will definitely protect Catherine. Phumkara, kill both of them. Dirty foreigner! - Kisna. Kisna, look how I killed this foreigner. Hail Mother Bhavani. Kisna! No. Uncle. Uncle went to kill Cathy. Well-done. Well-done, Kisna. Now you are a real Krishna. First you killed uncle and now.. ..you will kill me with this sword. Raise your sword. Kill me. No. No. I am very small in front of you. I am very small, brother. I request you, don't put me in such a big dilemma. You have to solve the dilemma. Your brother or that foreigner? No, brother. - Now see I am going to kill her. And you kill me. Nobody will interrupt. No, brother. No. - Do the same, which you do with others. How a younger brother kills elder brother.. - No, brother. Brother. - See.. No brother! No! Listen to me, brother. - Leave me. I bind you with mother's house. No, brother. - Leave me. Move! - I will not let you commit this sin. Move aside! - Brother, listen to me. No brother! Enough. Enough. Stop this right here. Don't force me. Don't force me. The girl whom you went to kill.. My mother ordered me to protect her. Your mother sent me. And mother also said that.. That even if I have to fight my brother for this justice.. Look, brother. I think.. I think I will die. But not you.. You have to live.. for mother. Very important for you to live. She will lose both her sons. This will be injustice with mother. Think. Let me go. Brother, I am requesting you. I am requesting you. Let me go for my mother's sake.. ..or else there will disaster. No Kisna, let him go. I want to die here in the land where I was born. Shankar, kill me. If you want to kill me, kill me. Rather than see you kill your own brother. Let me die. Kisna, let me die. Have you heard? Now, even if I have to cut off your head.. ..I will not hesitate. I swear on my mother. Our mother. Do you love Catherine? Tell me. Tell me. Answer me. Yes, I love her. I love Catherine. Catherine belongs to me. I will take her with me today right now. I will take her with me in front of everyone. Right in front of everyone. I want Kisna.. dead. "Color fades away." "Days change." "Night sleeps." "Paths go away." "Love never loses." "Love never retires." "Love never fades." "Yes, it doesn't change." "We're here, this moment together.. ..don't know what tomorrow holds.." "We may, may not come together." "We may, may not see forever.." "This story of love.. ..will always be here.." "Which the earth and the sky.. ..will always hear.." I told him. I told him to fight for her. I told him to protect that orphan girl. You have given us a lot of pain, a lot of pain. Envy has made you mad. - Yes, I am mad. No, grandpa, the thing is that.. ..Kisna and that white lady are.. - Shut up. Shut up. I can say anything about him because I've the right to say. I am about to be his wife. you don't have any right.. ..to say anything about my Kisna. Not even a word. "Hail Lord Brahma." "Hail Lord Brahma." "Hail Lord Brahma." "Hail Lord Brahma." - Lakshmi! "Hail Lord Brahma." "Hail Lord Brahma." "Hail Lord Brahma." "Hail Lord Brahma." "Hail Lord Brahma." "Hail Lord Brahma." Brother. Is there any hospital on way to Delhi? Gaziabad is one mile away from here. There is one hospital. There is chaos all around. - Why? Hindu Muslims are fighting among themselves because of Pakistan. I am telling you, return back. - Come on, hurry up. Return. This is all India radio. Today in Gaziabad the curfew has been increased.. ..for four hours more. But the curfew will be withdrawn.. ..from evening 4 to 5, so that everyone can do their duties. Mahatma Gandhi has sent a message to all.. ..the Hindu and Muslim brothers and sisters.. Who is coming this way in the curfew? Hey, what happened? Stop the vehicle. Hey, are you a Hindu or Muslim? Where are you taking this girl? Kisna.. I am Kisna. I am going to drop my master's daughter to Delhi. Hey, are you mad? Don't you know there is a curfew here. Want to die? Come on, return back. - Return back. 999 one number less to 1000. Mr. Ghulam, believe it or not. I have seen this vehicle before. Mr. Salam, it is 999. This jeep belongs to Prince Raghuraj. What's your name? - Kisna! Hit him! - Kisna! Kisna! Catherine! - Kisna! Come on, hurry up. Hindus are here. Help! Kisna! Help! Help! Kisna! Kisna! I love you. I love you. Stop! Stop! I am telling you to stop and you are driving? Who is in the car? Come out. It is me? - Me? Oh, Prince. Greetings, sir. Mr. Salam, it is Prince. Prince, you here in this chaos? Why your mother.. There are riots all around. Bloodshed, etc. oh God, what is going on here? Whatever, come on, turn back your vehicle. Come on, leave. We just now saw your jeep no. 999. Yes, one less in 1000. 999. That jeep belongs to Roger. One guy and a white lady were in the jeep. - Guy? - Yes. What was his name? - Name? Yes, Kisna. Kisna. - Kisna? Where did they go? - Just went, this way to Paliganj. I want that white lady at any cost. Search her for me. Catherine, stay here. Hey! Who are you? What is your name? Are you a Hindu or a Muslim? Tell me. Remove your clothes. Remove your clothes and show it to us. Why are you staring at us? Remove your clothes. Tell me. Are you a Hindu or a Muslim? - Stop. Don't do this, please. He.. he.. he.. He is my husband. He is a Christian. He is my husband, John Thomas. How can we believe you? - See this. See this. Now tell me if he is a Hindu or a Muslim? Is he is a Hindu or a Muslim? He is my husband. He is my husband. Why are you fighting among yourselves? It's your country, your nation. Protect your nation. Let us go. Please. Please, let us go. Go away. Why did you come here to die? Let's go. I will not let anything happen to you. Stop. The white lady is here. Let's take her. Please. We need help. Madam, we came to take you. Please! - Come on, let's take her. No, we are together. Catherine! - Please, leave me. You can't do this! I can't go without him. - Inspector, listen to me. - Kisna! Catherine. Catherine. - Kisna. Kisna. Kisna! Catherine! - Kisna. Hail India. "This story of love will always be here.." "Which the earth and the sky will always hear.." We want freedom! We want freedom! Officers, you shouldn't hold a lady like that.. ..and especially when she is about to be my wife. Catherine, this is all for you. Prince Raghuraj, you are an idiot. Listen, I am Kisna lover. I belong to Kisna. Catherine! You slapped me? You slapped me? - Leave me! See what I do. - Catherine! Catherine! You are Kisna's. You will be mine before. Come on now. Catherine! Catherine Don't you dare to go away from me? Catherine! Catherine! Kisna. Kisna! Kisna! Kisna! - Catherine! Catherine! Ms. I think you need some help. Is your name Kisna? - Yes. We came from British High Commission. We are very proud of you. You need to sign this paper. Paper? - That you are not safe in India. Miss. Catherine Bracket and Mrs. Jennifer Bracket said so. Jennifer? - She reached there safely with some Mr. Jumman. Thank God. - Due to Miss. Catherine Bracket and.. ..Mrs. Jennifer Bracket, British High Commission.. ..permitted you to go to England. You have to sign this paper and you then you will.. ..depart to England as a permanent member of.. ..Bracket family. How did all this? - Catherine Bracket. Can I meet Catherine? Kisna. I have been requested to go to England with you. Thank you, Catherine. This means that our love gets.. ..a chance to be with each other forever, right? - Yes. Catherine, I know that in a few days we started loving.. ..each other a lot. And now it's very clear to both of us.. ..our love was in our hearts it will always be.. ..for the rest of the life, but.. But the truth is that my fiance Lakshmi is waiting for me. And I will have to go to her. This is my right. Right? I didn't get you. It was my duty to bring you here safely. Now I have to fulfill my duties. I have to go to Lakshmi and accept the truth of life. Catherine! This is our tradition. At times, we lose someone and know love. By staying away, our love will go stronger. Love doesn't mean getting the person we love. We can love each other even in separation. Catherine, don't cry. In this journey of life.. ..sometimes we assume the commas to be full-stops. But they are not full-stops. The full-stop is only at the end of our lives. The love hasn't ended, but it has started now. Take care of yourself. Let me go back to my country.. ..to my new, independent India. And you go back to your England. So why shouldn't we separate with a smile? Do you know when you smile you look very beautiful. Smile for me. Goodbye, Cathy. Goodbye. Such was my Kisna. And also our Kisna. - Yes. Even yours? - Yes. - I am Kisna's younger son, Karan Singh. Kisna is no more. He passed away five years ago. He finished all his responsibilities and passed away. And Lakshmi.. But Lakshmi is still with us. Today, we are two brothers and one sister. Do you want to meet her? Mother, Karan brother has already met her. Lakshmi, did you recognise me? Catherine, Kisna has.. Lakshmi. I know. Your son told me. Catherine, you did a great thing by coming here. I guess God has kept me alive so that I could see you again. In 1947, Kisna sent you to England and came back to me. And then he married me and fulfilled my dream. Then we had a family and he kept me very happy. But I found a husband, not his love. He used to love you, Catherine. And I knew how much he loved you when.. ..at his deathbed he told me about his last wish. His last wish was that his ashes should be immersed.. ..in the valley of Ganges in Shivpur and nowhere else. The Ganges of Shivpur.. ..where you bathed for the first time. And where may be your souls me for the first time. One day he told me about that. Yes, Catherine, we have fulfilled Kisna's last wish. We have immersed his ashes in that valley.. ..and Kisna went into the Ganges of your love forever. See this.. a gift given by you. Kisna used to sit in solitude and play the same tune. He used to sit on the river banks and hum something. I used to feel jealous at that time. But today.. I am proud of Kisna. The love of soul can't match physical love. Kisna always used to tell this. Even after losing love, thinking of it till his last breath. That is love. A true love. This was our Kisna. Kisna used to love you so much.. ..and I was a fool that.. Lady Catherine Williams has announced in .. .. the Podigadwal ceremony that.. ..she will built a school and college.. ..in the name of the great person, Kisna. This world famous lady even told us that.. ..the real India and loyalty lies in villages in India. Our hopes took heights after listening to her story. Tell it this way that Lord Krishna had come here in disguise of Kisna.. ..and reminds us about the value of India and goes back. But we found out a hidden part of Lady Catherine.. ..that she still loves Kisna, as much as.. ..Kisna loved her. Lady Catherine has told her last wish in her will. She wants that after her death her ashes should be.. ..immersed in India and especially.. ..in the Ganges in Shivpuri. - Just like Kisna. Did you love him so much, granny? Yes, darling. Yes. - Love has ended, but it started now. "We're here, this moment together.. ..don't know what tomorrow holds.." "We may, may not come together." We may, may not see forever.." "This story of love.. ..will always be here." "Which the earth and the sky.. ..will always hear.."
