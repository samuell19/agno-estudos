(laughter) (door closes) Damn. What the hell happened to you? Would you mind your business, Michelle? Taking care of Cherie tonight, okay? TREY: Yep. CHERIE: Is that yours? Yeah. - MICHELLE: Ey, ey, easy. - (spritzing) I think you got bigger problems than smelling floral. Would you shut the fuck up? My God. (Dawn sighs) Hey, you want to watch the movie with us? Home girl's about to get got but, you know, in a fun way. (Sally screaming) (screaming, whimpering) No, I'm good. (sighs) Look, I know you and I got a lot of unresolved shit. It is what it is. Okay. Yeah. Hey, why don't you go clean up, 'cause you're looking really, um... Well, you know what you look like. Yeah, like toe-up fucking Barbie. DAWN: Really, Michelle? Yeah, she does. - You don't see it? - (screaming on TV) So, listen, I called the babysitter. She can't stay but she has a friend she trusts, so we're good. You can sleep in Norlon's room, if you want. I really need tampons. Tampons? Sure. My favorite. (chuckles softly) You know I love buying you tampons. You're gonna have to get them for Luze someday. Damn right, I am. Tampon, pads, heating pads, shoulder pads. Whatever she needs. Ooh, good choice. Listen, uh, what happened tonight... …it wasn't your fault. You didn't do anything wrong. I was just being stupid. - All right? - (knocks) (footsteps departing) NORLON: Nice kicks. That is clean. I smelled it. Hey, do you still read those tarot cards? Uh, not since my grandma passed. Why? Is there something you want to know? Yeah. Okay. All right. Am I gonna die tonight? Well, Trey's friends usually ask me if they're gonna get laid. But, uh... all right. I'm gonna start with your past. Ten of Swords. Five of Pentacles and Knight of Swords. You know what? Let's just... let's just move on from your past. You already know what happened. Let's just go right to your future. - All right? - (inhales deeply) All right. Future. ♪ ♪ Do they all look like that? Do you still go to church? No. You might want to go back. (sighs) My, uh... my grandma used to say there's no bad hand in a tarot reading. It's all about how you look at the cards. So even these fucked-up ones could force you to look at life in a new way. Like, you see this card? This is strength, power, crazy determination. An unstoppable fucking force. I already know who he is. No. This card is not him. This card is you. (doorbell rings) (panting) Who the fuck are you? ETHAN: I'm here for Cherie. (quietly): You got to be fucking kidding me. Let's fucking go. (unsheathes sword) Do not let him in. Take Norlon back outside. He doesn't need to see all this. No, no, please listen. Just do not let him in.
