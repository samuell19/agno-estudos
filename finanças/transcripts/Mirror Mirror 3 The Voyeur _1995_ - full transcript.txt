(ominous percussive orchestral music) - [Cassandra Voiceover] It's almost time. You must keep your word to me, my beautiful mirror. We must be ready. This is the image I would preserve. This is what I would be for all time. No matter what may happen, remember your word. (screaming) (door thudding) (screaming) (body thudding) (eerie atmospheric music) - What? Cassandra. - Isn't it unique? - I think that it has incredible potential, a very dramatic killing. (laughing) - You. You don't have the same beliefs as me, but your work is as mystical as mine, your paintings. Mmm, I'll miss you till then. (gasping) (moaning) - Cassandra. - Mmm, I do love you, Anthony. I'd do anything to keep us together. - It's getting late, we should go. I have to go to that art opening. - Come back to me after the show? - What about Julio? - [Cassandra] He's gone till Wednesday. - Sometimes I can smell him on you. Makes me crazy. - [Cassandra] Someone has to pay the bills. - I know. - I have a surprise for you. Now, don't forget me, Anthony. (moaning) (punches thudding) (groaning) - Whoa. - Come on, you idiot. You cost me $50,000. Stupid is as stupid does, Ramone. (head thudding) (light synth music) (wind howling) (ominous synth music) Let's hope for your sake, Ramone, I get my 50 Gs back, huh? Now drive. Now! (intense rock music) (gun firing) (guns firing) (ominous synth music) Nobody messes with Julio Menendez and lives to regret it. (laughing) - Fuck you guys! - Adios, asshole. Eenie meenie miney mo. (screaming) (thudding) (tires screeching) - [Man] Oh my God, someone jumped! - [Woman] Somebody call 911. - [Man] I'll call them. (dreamy synth music) (moaning) - This is what I foresaw. Oh. Anthony. Anthony. Anthony. Anthony. Anthony. The moment is here at last. I'm yours forever. That's how you wanted it. We will be together always. - I found you. - [Cassandra Voiceover] No matter what may happen, I love you, Anthony. He's here. Time for him to die. (door banging) Whatever happens now, don't forget me, Anthony. Remember, forever. (ominous atmospheric music) - Lucy, I'm home! Cassandra! (frame thudding) Ready or not, here I come. Come out, come out, wherever you are. (ominous atmospheric music) There you are. Why don't you answer me, huh? Too busy playing in your freaking mirror. - It's a free country. I can do what I want. - I don't give a damn about your pinching mirror. As long as I pay the bills, you ain't free. You know what I mean? - Yes, I know. (whooshing) - Good. So, tell me, where you been today, huh? - Out, shopping. - That's not what Ramone said. - Ramone would say anything to piss you off. Should have got rid of that shit a long time ago. - He's more loyal to me than you ever were. - [Cassandra] Yeah, then why isn't he in your bed? (grunting) (gasping) - I'm sick of your lip. Now, who you been seeing? - No one. (grunting) (gasping) No lies! I know you've been seeing someone else. I know it. - Why would I, what with your sparkling personality and all? (gasping) (heavy breathing) - If I find out who he is, I'm gonna cut off his balls. - Why? You gonna replace the balls you don't got. - Enough of your bitch lingo attitude. Slut! (ominous atmospheric music) (grunting) - I knew you'd kill me eventually, despite it all. (screaming) (gasping) - Oh, baby. You gotta do better than that. (wind whooshing) (eerie atmospheric music) (eerie chiming music) Punta. (gasping) (laughing) (moaning) (grunting) (moaning) Punta. (groaning) I'll see you in hell. (screaming) (intense orchestral music) (upbeat funk music) (hydraulics whirring) - Come on, Joey, this is heavy. Would you hurry up, Joey? - Hold on, I'll get you a lighter one. - Well, hurry up. - Do you want me to take something? - No, honey, Joey's got it. - Anthony, honey, I do wanna help. - Gee, thanks. - No problem. What would you like me to do with this? (both laughing) Don't even think about it. - [Joey] Here ya go. - [Anthony] Oh, man, that's heavy. What is in this? - Your paints. - My paints? Damn it, be careful. - That's why I gave 'em to you. Hold on, there's another one. - You get it. - Okay, fine. I'll set it on your paintings. - Excuse me? - [Joey] I'm kidding, I'm kidding. - Yeah, well you stop kidding because we got a lot of work to do. - Boys, boys, don't argue. Anthony, why don't you carry this in and I'll stay here and supervise Joey. - Is this it? - Yeah. ♪ Oh ha hey ♪ ♪ Oh ha ha ♪ ♪ Oh ha hey ♪ ♪ Oh ha ha ♪ ♪ Oh ha hey ♪ (light synth music) - Are those his paintings from the San Diego show? - Yep, these two go in, the rest stay in the van. - Let me see. - He might not like it. You know how he is about his paintings. - Move over, honey. My gallery carries more of his art than anybody else's. Besides, I'm gonna see them eventually. - Would you be cool? - Oh, he can't see. - He might. Now knock it off. - Not excited by a little risk, Joey? - Oh, yeah? - [Cassandra] Anthony? Anthony? (dreamy synth music) - So, what are we doing here? - You'll see. You said you'd help me, remember? Sit over there. I will sit here. - And what? - Close your eyes? - Why? - 'Cause I said so. And that's how it works. No peeking. Ow. Give me your hand. - Hey. - Shh, shh. - What are you doing? - It's magic, Anthony, it's magic. Now, we're one forever. - Hey. Come on, Carolyn, knock it off. Not now. - Oh, come on. - What, are you crazy? He might come back any second. - Fine. Maybe when he goes away for his next exhibit? - Yeah, maybe. ♪ Do what you do to me. ♪ - Anthony. Where do you want these? Same as the other room? - [Anthony] Yeah. - That room freaks me out, man. - Yeah, that's the point. Perfect for my work. (clearing throat) - Still miss her? - No, just another in a long series of c'est la vie. - Mmm, yeah. She didn't mean a thing to you. - I missed her. I needed her, she needed me. That's all, we needed each other. - And this place doesn't mean a thing to you either? - That's different. This place inspires me. - Yeah, I bet. You know, Anthony, you were crazy to mess with her. - She thought that you were jealous of us. - Oh, don't be ridiculous. But hubby was a drug dealer. - She didn't love him, not anymore. - Oh, well, now you have me. - Well, there is some irony for you. She always said that in the end, I'd be that one that was used. - Mmm, we're using each other. That's how it works. Love is for fools. - What's next? You want me to carry the van in now? - That's it for today. In the morning, though, I want you to take Cassandra's and Julio's stuff down to the basement. - What about you? - I will be painting. - Joey, don't argue with your brother. He's my income. Let him paint. - I pay the rent, you clean. - I just didn't expect to clean something the size of Dodger's Stadium. - Well, boys, I'll let you two settle this little domestic spat yourselves. - You could stay here tonight, if you want to. - After the stadium's been cleaned, maybe. Bye, Joey. - [Anthony] If you need anything, I'll be upstairs. - If you hear a scream, it's just me popping a hernia. (dreamy synth music) (wind whooshing) (ladder crashing) Anthony, what are you doing? What was the bang? - Nothing, I knocked over the ladder. I'm gonna take this into my room. - Cool, self-love. - No, I'm sentimental. I wish you'd be a little more sentimental with my canvases. - Need a hand? - [Anthony] No, I got it. (ominous synth music) (grunting) (screaming) (percussive synth music) - See you in hell! (screaming) - Cassandra. - I expected you sooner. - What are you doing here? (laughing) - Why, I live here, Anthony. You know that. - No, no, no, no. You've been gone two months. - Two months? I don't think so. - You disappeared with Julio. - I couldn't leave you, Anthony. We were one, remember? - [Anthony] I remember that you left me. - We're one with blood, Anthony. - [Anthony] You're not real. You're a dream. - Part dream, but I could be real if you wish it. - I wish you were here, Cassandra. - Then for the moment, I am. - Oh, so cold. - Then warm me. Warm me like you used to. (moaning) Shhh. (light synth music) (moaning) (scratching) (light laughing) (eerie atmospheric music) - [Joey] Whoa, shit. You scared the heebie jeebies outta me. - Detective Kobeck, DEA. - [Joey] Oh. - May I come in? - Uh, would it matter if I minded? - This is merely routine. I have a few questions to ask Anthony DeMarco. Is that you? - No, he's my brother. He don't do drugs. - Nobody said he did. Is he here? - He's taking a nap. - At four in the afternoon? - Yeah, when else do people take naps? What happened to your leg? (gun firing) (grunting) - Just one of the perks of the job. - Who are you? - Kobeck, DEA. Do you know a woman by the name of Cassandra Duncan, married name, Menendez? - I'll be back in a minute. - Maybe. What'd she do? - Well, that's just it. We don't know yet. She disappeared after her husband was killed in a drug bust. - So, what you're saying is you don't know where Cassandra is. - Well, I was hoping you could tell me. - For some reason, this is starting to sound a little like an interrogation. - Well, you were seeing each other, right? - Now my sex life is public knowledge. - It is when you're sleeping with a wife of a drug dealer. Police surveillance. - I'll bet. - If it's any consolation to you, our focus was on him. Julio, not on what you were doing. - So then why all the interest in Cassandra? - Well, the file's closed on Julio, but not on her, so I'm kinda doing this on my own. You know, I guess you could say I'm a cop with a heart. (chuckling) - Well, all I know is they both disappeared about two months ago. - You know, out of curiosity, what are you doing living here now? - I'm an artist, as I'm sure you know. Police surveillance. And this place is perfect for my style of painting. (eerie whooshing) - [Kobeck] How about relatives? She have any? - Her mother and her father are both dead. At least that's what she told me. That's it? No trouble? - Messing around with a drug dealer's wife isn't exactly bright, but I guess there's no law against it. You mind if I look around? - Well, actually, I'm right in the middle of some very important work, so maybe later. You'll let me know if she contacts you. - Yeah, and I'd appreciate you doing the same for me. Thanks. - Yeah. - [Joey] What was that all about? - Somebody murdered Julio. - [Joey] Well, from what you tell me, it couldn't have happened to a better guy. (dreamy synth music) - Ah. - Shh, shh. - What are you doing? - It's magic, Anthony, it's magic. Now we're one forever. (moaning) (screaming) - Whoa, you all right? - Oh, man. I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm a little bit on edge. - No shit. Here take a load off. - Ah, thanks. - So, what are you working on? - It is another one of my dreams. - Taking it to show in San Diego? - No, only taking the ones that are already finished. - So, when are you heading down? - First thing in the morning. - When are you coming back? - Well, I'm not sure. Sort of promised Alan that I would party with him and some of his artistic friends. You know, if you need a little privacy, the house to yourself, maybe for a girl. You know, I could stay over for an extra day or two. - Nah, I'm staying away from the woman for a while. They're trouble. - Yeah, that would be a first. - Looks like you could get rid of a few troubles yourself. - This is creative inspiration. - For that? Man, you outta try and get over that. - Maybe. - All right, I'll be downstairs. (knocking on door) - Hi, Joey. Is he up yet? - Yeah, he's upstairs working on a painting? - For the San Diego show? - No, he said he couldn't finish it in time. - He is still going, right? - Yeah, why? - This is why. - Carolyn. - What, you don't like it? - Nah, I'm just, I'm kinda freaked out. He is my brother and he's having a hard enough time now as it is. - What are you talking about? You're not talking about Cassandra, are you? - He can't sleep at night and a cop came by here today asking about her. - Really? Hmm, he didn't mention it to me. - Well, he'll tell you about it. Just go upstairs, all the way to the back and to the right. - All right, we'll finish this later. (dreamy synth music) (footsteps approaching) - Carolyn. - Promising, but what is it? - Ah, another in my sequence of dreams. They always give me my best work. - Uh, yeah, I know. You know, if I had dreams like you, I'd have my head examined. - Ah, but if my nightmares ever ended, so does my career and so does your art gallery. - Wait a minute. Is that Cassandra? - Sort of. She started as the focal point. - I'll bet. And now you're living in her house. You know, it's a dump. - Yeah, but it's a great big roomy dump. - It's still a dump, Anthony. I mean, for what you're paying rent here, you could've got a great loft downtown. - I need to be here. - Yeah, it's like she's cast a spell on you, you know? Something to draw you back here. - Maybe she has. - [Carolyn] As long as it makes you produce great work, Anthony. - And it does. And this will be done in a couple of days. - So, what did the cops want? - Maybe late or not, you did not come here to talk about the cops. - Mmm, no, I didn't. - Let's go. (footsteps approaching) (light synth music) - [Carolyn] That thing is ugly. How can you sleep in the same room with it? - I like it. It's filled with mystery, like it's watching us. - Yeah, well let it watch this. (dreamy synth music) (wind whooshing) (yelling) What's the matter? What is it? What's the matter? - I'm sorry. I'm a little stressed out from the show. - Great. I thought you were having a seizure. I should've known what I was getting into, sleeping with an artist, but lucky for you, I'm understanding. So, are you ever gonna tell me what's going on? - It's about Cassandra. - Nice, you couldn't have picked a better time. - [Anthony] She's missing. Police don't know where she's at. - [Carolyn] Did you ever tell her about us? - No, I never told her. (scratching) (light laughing) - What's that? - [Anthony] I don't know, a ghost thing. (light laughing) - There it is again. Anthony. Okay, I'm leaving. - [Anthony] Probably rats. - Rats? - [Anthony] What? - [Carolyn] I'm leaving. - [Anthony] Why? - [Carolyn] What do you think? - Carolyn, they're harmless. - I mean it. I loathe the little creatures. - Shit. Carolyn, come back here. - What was her deal? - Rats are her deal. In the attic, remember? That's what scared her off. - Rats, rats, rats, ah. Women, man. All right, I'll go to the hardware store and get some traps. - Thank you. - You got any more money? That's all right, I got it. Later. (light synth music) - Detective Kobeck, how are you? Taken any good bribes lately? I can't go back to jail, man! I'd rather die! I'll split it with you. It's here in the house, man. - What are you talking about? - Come on, we could make a deal. 400 grand, 400 grand. (scratching) (dreamy synth music) - Cassandra, what are you doing here? What's going on? - [Cassandra] I could ask you the same thing. - [Anthony] What do you mean? - [Cassandra] I mean, how long have you been sleeping with that slut? - I don't know what you're talking about. - [Cassandra] I'm talking about Carolyn. How long? Did it start when we were together? Answer me! - I've been involved with her a long time before I met you. - Yet you never said a thing. - [Anthony] Doesn't matter. It wasn't serious. - [Cassandra] You're lying. - You think I didn't give a damn about Julio? - That was different. - Different? How was that different? Think it's different 'cause you're married. You think that makes it different? That don't make it different. That just makes it worse. - I killed him for you, Anthony. - Julio died during a drug deal. - I made them do it. - That's insane. You couldn't do that. - I could and I did. My own dark art and a wish. - Well, I don't believe you. - You never understood my power and what it could do. Well, it's time for show and tell, Anthony. (ominous orchestral music) Watch. (eerie atmospheric music) (laughing) - Can't believe I let that bitch cut me like that. - [Ramone] Let me see it. - Aye, cabron. (door slamming) (eerie atmospheric music) (laughing) (speaking foreign language) (gun firing) (thudding) - You all right, man? - Hey. (suspenseful synth music) (laughing) (grunting) (gun cocking) - Beautiful, ah, come here. (laughing) He, there you go, man. (screaming) Baby, you got better looking, you know that? (glass smashing) Hot mama. Yeah, coochie coo, baby, daddy's home. (laughing) (speaking foreign language) Carlotta and I got a lot of catching up to do. (laughing) You know, baby, you're the only woman I ever loved this morning. - Watch my art, (ominous rock music) (heavy punching and kicking) (grunting) (laughing) You never believed in my own special art. (heavy punching) (screaming) (gun firing) (bottle smashing) (gun firing) (heavy punching) (gun firing) (gun firing) (screaming) (laughing) (gun firing) (guns firing) (guns firing) (laughing) (heavy punching) (gun firing) (laughing) (screaming) (gun firing) (gun firing) (screaming) (ominous chiming music) If Carolyn ever comes back here, I'll turn this dream into a nightmare.

(eerie whooshing) So, what's up? - I spoke to one of my colleagues from the raid on Julio's gang. - And? - One of the gang members said that Julio killed his wife. - What? - He may not have been telling the truth, but if he was, it means that Julio did it before he left here. - Why? - 'Cause she sure as hell wasn't there. I checked. - He couldn't have. - We talking about Julio Menendez? Yeah, he could and would have. - Her body's not here. I may not be a detective like you, but I would've noticed. - Well, I'm not getting anywhere with this thing. - I'm sorry. - Well, you remember our deal, huh? Anything comes up, you give me a call. - Yeah, sure. (upbeat funk music) - [Anthony] See you later, Joey. - Later. ♪ Yeah yeah yeah ♪ ♪ Yeah yeah yeah ♪ ♪ Yeah yeah yeah ♪ - Carolyn, it's Joey. Yeah, he just split. I don't know when he's coming back. Yeah, yeah, wanna mess around? I'll meet you there. We'll get drunk. All right, bye. (laughing) Whoa. - Ah. They said that Julio killed her. - That's what he told me. - Yeah, but that's crazy. I don't believe it. (laughing) - [Joey] That's what he told me. Why would Anthony make it up? - I didn't say he made it up. I said, I don't believe it. - Why not? - 'Cause why would Julio kill his own wife? - Because he was a psychotic drug dealer. (chuckling) - But that doesn't automatically make him a bad person. I mean, just because he's a drug dealer, doesn't mean that he's gonna go around killing everybody. - That's what they do on that show, Miami Heist. (laughing) - You watch too many reruns. (laughing) So, when's he coming back. - Late. - How late? - Three, four in the morning. - So, we have time, huh? (ominous synth music) (rustling) - What was that? - [Joey] It's an old house, it creaks. - You did take care of your infestation problem, didn't you? - I told you, we have to get the professional exterminators to take care of it. They're coming Saturday. - Yeah, but it's not in your room, is it? - Nah. (laughing) Come on, want me to show ya? - Stupid question. Not as tasteful as Anthony's. - It's got what we need and plus I didn't invite you to come here to criticize my room anyway. - Why did you ask me to come here? - I don't know, why? - I don't know. (eerie whooshing) (light synth music) (moaning) Mmm, that was nice. - Ah. - Men. Where's your bathroom? - Down the hall and to the right. - I'll be back. - Ah. (eerie atmospheric music) (eerie atmospheric music) - Hey! What's taking so long? Carolyn. Carolyn, you out there? The door is stuck. Carolyn! Carolyn! Carolyn. Carolyn. Help me out of here, the door is stuck. I need a hand. - What the... - [Joey] Carolyn, can you hear me? - Joey. - Okay, you push, I'll pull. Give it a tug on your side. - All right, hang on. - [Joey] Can you hear me? Push. - Why don't you try pulling while I push. - All right, go on. (eerie atmospheric music) You push, I'll pull. All right.

What's going on? - You heard me. I want you the hell out of my house. - [Carolyn] You're crazy and you're supposed to be dead. - No, but you're going to be. - What's going on? (eerie atmospheric music) Come on! (screaming) (thudding) (grunting) Carolyn, Carolyn. Carolyn, Carolyn, Ca... She fell, man. We gotta get her to a hospital. It's not how it looks, man. - Yeah, good, because it looks like shit, Joey! (heavy smacking) Fuck you. How long has this been going on, Joey? Huh? My little brother, don't even touch me! (eerie atmospheric music) (eerie atmospheric music) (ominous synth music) (scratching) (eerie atmospheric music) (painting thudding) (eerie atmospheric music) - What's the matter, Kobeck? Do I frighten you? (laughing) You liked me well enough when you were watching me through the window with Anthony. What's the matter? Can't handle the real thing. - So, you did survive. You're not dead. And you know where the money is too, don't you? - I know where everything is. - I wondered why you put up with him. Why a woman like you would be with a slime like Julio. - [Cassandra] Why, detective, I do believe you're paying me a compliment. (ominous synth music) - It wasn't the sex, was it? You covered that department with the artist, didn't you? - [Cassandra] Maybe I could show you. - We'll play after I get the money. Where is it? - [Cassandra] Turn around, it's practically behind you. (laughing) (intense synth music) (ominous synth music) (ominous synth music) (eerie atmospheric music) (knocking on door) - Hey, I want you out of here by morning. You hear me? Hey, Joey! Great. (eerie atmospheric music) What the hell is going on? (wind whooshing) (ominous synth music) - Surprise. - Cassandra. - Anthony, I missed you. - [Anthony] I had to leave. - Yes, to your show. - [Anthony] Right. - Carolyn seems to have had a bit of a breakdown. - What have you done? - What was necessary. What's wrong? (ominous synth music) - Told me you were dead. Julio killed you. - Does this look like death to you, Anthony? - [Anthony] No. - Not even death can keep us apart. Don't you remember the spell? - I remember. (wind whooshing) This isn't a dream, is it? This is real, all of it. - Part dream. A little creative illusion by me. (wind whooshing) (eerie atmospheric music) - You see what you're doing to me. You're driving me into madness with your insanity. - [Cassandra] Does it matter? - Yes. (wind whooshing) It matters. I don't want this haunting anymore. I need you out. - [Cassandra] I need you. (wind whooshing) (heart beating) - Oh, you're so cold. Always so cold. - It never bothered you before.
