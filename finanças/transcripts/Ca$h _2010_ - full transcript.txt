It is more than 70 thousand U.S. dollars you said, is not it? I think I forgot some things. It is perfectly natural. Everything looks so good too. The big-screen TV, the Range Rover. It looks very good. Thank you. So ... U.S. $ 625,761 gross ... less the $ 74,316.47 ... equal a. .. U.S. $ 551,414.53. Correct. U.S. $ 551,414.53 ... is the number in which we focus. We need to bring all that money back, right? Okay, Sam? You still have some. Okay, can connect the path. Let's visit the banks. CHICAGO BANK CHARTER Very good. Walking. 65, 66 ... Great. Next bank. It was fun, right? Leslie ... Get your calculator. Sit. Okay. Subtract these values of our total. U.S. $ 54,557. U.S. $ 13,660. $ 83,000. U.S. $ 15,236 dollars. How long? U.S. $ 268,184.53.

Well, what's in the box, of course. Fetch. Mother, please, go get the box. Who do you think you are? I am one of those people you never find ... provided that an honest citizen.

Vivo fixed income. Return it! Mother, we leave it with you to maintain security. I only had a look, baby. There was so much. It was not his! Well, it was yours too, was it? This is a lesson ... when it comes to money, nobody can be trusted. Like mother, like daughter. Turn off the engine and give me the key. Keep an eye. You two. Sam, what are we doing? Sam, what are we doing? I do not know, Les. I do not know what we should be doing. We have the right to do this? I do not know anymore. Of course we have.

Please, just this once. - They spent, is gone. - No! All was lost. I'll get it back. Okay. Do your thing. As usual. Suit yourself. I'll see you when you leave this joint. Let's talk about the rest of the money you owe me. What are you talking about? What are you talking about? We spent the rest over. And now we have to recover it. The deficit is U.S. $ 78,298. What? Why not take the Range Rover, the furniture, everything? I do not want their property, Sam. I am not a trader. I'm more like a banker. I need money. We have $ 78 mil! U.S. $ 78,298. We do not have it. You know what? Can not forget it? You have more than $ 500 mil. And just leave us alone! Regrets that he spent. We believe that God was smiling at us. We were wrong. Sorry. Nothing is free, Leslie. Not in this lifetime. Did you know that the money was not his. And spent. Now you have to pay. What will you do? Will kill us? We do not have! We will not discuss consequences. Let us focus on how you will reimburse me. Good food, Leslie. It would be better if it were meat, but is good nonetheless. Sam cooked. Welcome home, Sam? Is there something I need to do for me now. What is it? I need their cell phones. Fetch. Thank you. Leslie, can go ? kitchen and bring me the phone, please? Yes I noticed that there is another outlet. Where is it? The fourth. Can you bring the phone Room, Leslie? - Yes - Thank you. We are getting more complicated part ? this recovery action. Want to keep this between us, right? We are reaching a point you and Leslie ... need to put his hand in his pocket. And when that happens people want to call someone. That's weird. Human nature, I guess. Always want to do connection. Now, why not tell me your plan to give me back the rest of the money. We have a plan. We sell the Range Rover, worth about $ 70 mil ... sell new furniture and do not know, get the rest borrowed from friends. The loan with friends, good luck. The Range Rover, all right. But the furniture, not take long. I give them 5 days from now. And if we fail? Inconsequential advance. You know the consequences only when a line is crossed ... and a decision is taken. Yes Are in good shape. - I give U.S. $ 47 thousand for it. - What? Wait a minute, he's talking about? We pay almost $ 70 billion a week ago, in cash. Yes, yes. No. I sold him a new car and you brought me a used back. It has only 190km, the love of Christ. We can do the following, and is my best offer. Pay U.S. $ 53 thousand for it and seeing the old car for you. What do you think? You can pay in cash? So U.S. $ 53 thousand of U.S. $ 78,298 ... leaves an incredible debt U.S. $ 25,298. You can not give us a time? I mean, take your debt? The answer is no, I will not do that. Listen, we can not more. You still have a home. Drugs, Leslie! Will not stick to our house asshole! I do not want your house, Leslie. I was thinking ... in cash from refinancing. No. No, our house. Let's stop with this ridiculous now? This crap has gone too far! Sam, this unfortunate only speaks nonsense! What he can do in broad daylight? Let's go, Sam, go away. He can stay with that jalopy. Leslie, you take a decision now ... and live with the consequences later, remember that? Fuck. It is an idle threat, Sam. It's all lies! Get in the car, Leslie. - He's bluffing. - Get in the car. Let. It's a damn tyrant. We can go. - Start the car. Let. - Let's call the police. Where? Where his house was financed. Mr. and Mrs. Phelan, is his desire that you have access ... to your personal finances? Yes, of course. Why not? What was the purchase price original home? The initial purchase price was U.S. $ 200 mil. Purchased when? Five years ago. What is the price? U.S. $ 647.70 per month. Term of loan? 29. How much input? Well, 10% $ 20 mil. So, if the entry is the same ... when they bought the house when they were $ 20 mil ... - And still have this amount today, right? - Well, technically, yes. They paid monthly, faithfully ... the last 5 years ... which reaches U.S. $ 38,862, right? 38,862. Are correct. So, discounting the interest, paid about $ 13 mil ... mortgage debt, is not it? Yes That's right, yes. They still need $ 167 mil. Now, in the last five years, the property valued. Yes, of course. But we can not be sure without an evaluation. Yes, but even so, appreciated. Let's use a conservative number, say $ 20 billion in five years. This is equal to what? $ 4 per year. I would not say it is very optimistic. No, it seems reasonable. Sure. So, discounting the recovery with benefits paid ... they have 53 thousand U.S. dollars equity in the house. And as such, I see no reason to this institution ... should not lend them U.S. $ 25,298 looking for ... than half of their existing assets. Well, I ... We left our jobs. - Are you unemployed? - Yes Know the housing loan undocumented? Yes, of course. It? This style requires no employment, no income or assets. Lenders show no information beyond credit profile ... - And the value of the property. - Of course. The Phelan has equity. Could obtain a loan equal to 80%. I do not know if this bank has issued without a loan document. I do not know if we can do it. The credit rating of them ... Listen ... I think you're missing a great opportunity here, Mr. Dink. It's Dale. - Mr. Dale. - Whatever. We could go somewhere else ... and know your branch manager would angry about losing a business ... especially in view of the fact that this institution ... holds the first mortgage. But it is urgent. These people need the money today. Tell your terms. At today's prices, have more capital than necessary ... more money to the bank if you decide to quit, you know? It's a beautiful business. I bet that it would promote a someone. Maybe I can consider a small loan ... for urgent home repairs. Interest rates. Well, of course. Well .. got the fair market value ... times 80% of the loan ... which is equal to U.S. $ 86 mil ... less compound interest during the term of the loan. I borrow U.S. $ 11,421.89. This is the ultimate in a pure loan a candidate unemployed. They accept. Make a deposit cash. They will redeem it here. So, Sam ... how you will accomplish the remaining U.S. $ 13,876.11? Why do it? The money is not his own. That's where you're wrong The money is mine ... and I'll stay with him until a higher power to take away from me. So, the question remains. How will I pay U.S. $ 13,876.11 you owe me? Here are your fucking 11 cents! Thank you, Leslie. Why you can not leave us in peace? I understand your frustration ... same ... but precise amount. We do not have and there is no other place we can do it. So, you have to kill us or ... Easy. Exaggerating. Let's calm down, okay? We'll have a nice meal, Distributor will watch big-screen TV ... and tomorrow, think of something, okay? You still have four more days. Les? Les, come on, wake up.

I can not do that! Damn! Do not know what you can do, Sam. Will be surprised to see how easy it is. Most men are cowards not true, Sam? All women are cowards. The fear of this weapon will make them obey every command ... exactly as you obey me. Now, go there and steal it. The time of the revolt was over, Sam. I want my money. - Now, go there and steal it. - Okay, okay. Stay calm. Sam? Phone. Drugs. Hello? Sam, I am. Keep the line open. I want to hear everything that is happening inside, you know?
