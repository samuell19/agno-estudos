Recently, I'm really into oil painting. I paint every day, that's why paint is all over my hands. I'm also very interested in fashion. I want to do design-related work in the future. My favorite type of boys are gentle and strong ones. For example, Mokkun from Shibugaki-Tai. He has manly eyebrows. And... No, stop it! It's no use shooting me. It's no use... 12th grade. Class B.

By the way, I've been having problems with constipation recently. I'm looking for a good medicine to treat it. But I can't talk about this with other people. Well, I've already said it, though. My ideal man is someone who is tall, slender and fair-skinned: a pretty boy type. No! Let me go! No! No! No! Stop it! No! The End
