James! For Christ sake, you're late again! Why this freaking door is locked all the time? You get to stop this! I can't be running you to school every day. - It's ok. I still get the bus. - And what about your breakfast? - James, is your mom not leaving today? - Another free period? - On my fifth form, am I? I get a lot of free periods. - How is the course work coming along? - Alright, I almost finished the last book. But... I'm not enjoying it. - Let's see if we can find you something else. - Here you go - Thank you. But this is your copy! - I trust you. I hope at it will benefit you. - Sure it will. Thank you very much. I did not know you played the piano. I heard the choir practice, are you? - Yes, well... I've been playing since I was child. - I'd love to play an instrument. - Can you teach me [...]? - No, I just enjoy playing. - Thanks again for the book. I leave it back as soon as I can. - Take care, James. UNLOCK YOUR DOOR - Please... wait... I've noticed you in here before. I can see, you're nervous. Don't be. - I've never done this before. - You''ll be safe with me. We just talk. - I can't... - It will be alright. I'll not do anything, you don't not want to do. - Someone can come in. - No one ever comes in here. But if you like, we can go somewhere else. My car is outside. - I have to go. My father is waiting for me. - How the hell did you manage to miss both buses? I mean have I not got enough today? - I had to stay behind for my art class. I don't realize the time. - You're doing a lot of that lately. - Sorry. - James, there is something wrong? Has something happened at school? - I'm just tired! I'm alright. - Something is wrong with you. - I'm fine! I just have a lot of work to do. - You worry too much about that boy. I'd ever known him to get into trouble. - That's not the point. Something , obviously, is troubling him.. - I'm sure he's fine. He is just in a difficult age. Probaby he is lost after some girl. - You never take things seriously! What if something is wrong? - Then he will tell us. - He never tells us anything! You should know that! He never talk about his friends, or school. Nothing! - I'm sure will be fine in a day or two. - Yes, I'm sure he will... - You and your fucking date. I should have left you then - Do not start that again! You weren't forced! I was only doing what I thought was best at the time! - I was so young... Knew exactly what you were doing! I just went alone with things. I should never have gone with you! - I thought we've left that part behind us. - It's what we always do. You never want to talk about anything. I don't think you give a damn about me or James. - What do you mean? You don't think I work hard enough for this family? - Family? What family? You're never here. I do not think you even care for your son. - Oh, Christ! It's always about him. If anything is wrong with him, it's your doing.. You knew I never want that fucking jinx. - Where're you going? Big shame... you are gay, hey? ... - Is everything okay? I know you're not here to talk about your course work. What's trouble you? - Well... I am having troubles with my course work. I can't work at home. - Well, it's important to have a comfortable working environment. Plus it's good idea to have a revision time table. But you need to find time to relax. It just... at home... I don't get much peace. My parents... - I understand. Sometimes... relationships can be difficult. Have you tried talking to them? - It's difficult. I need to talk to someone who understands. - Understands? - I think I... I might... be gay. You won't expect [...]? Were you? - Actually, I was. It takes a lot of courage... to tell someone what you just told me. You are very brave. - I feel so stupid. I'm sorry. I didn't know who else. But, I wouldn't go telling anyone else. - Okay, James. You've done the right thing. But I wouldn't go telling anyone else. It could get difficult. I remember years ago another pupil here had an awful time... for that reason. - I do not care about that! Don't have any friends here, anyway. What make the difference. - You have friends. I see you with people in my class. - They are just classmates. You are my friend. - James, you misunderstand. I can not do anything for you. I mean, I can listen... but as your teacher... - I can't give you any advice. - But, sir... - Perhaps it would be best if you speak to the school counsellor. - I do not need a counsellor! - If you don't want that, there are help lines and church groups Ican get you their phone numbers... But I can't do anything else for you. I told you, you have been very brave... coming to me. But you can't come here anymore. Trust me. You may be angry with me now... but this is for your own good. I have to get some books from the main office. But you can stay here for a while if you wish. - Do you have somewhere we can go?
