¶ [ Dramatic Fanfare ] ¶ [ Orchestra: Slow March ] [ Footsteps Approaching, Marching To Rhythm ] [ Marching Continues, Louder ] [ Marching Stops ] [ Weapons Snapping ] [ Man Narrating ] OF ALL THE QUESTIONS LEFT UNANSWERED BY THE LAST WAR-- AND PROBABLY ANY WAR-- ONE COMES BACK CONSTANTLY TO MY MIND-- [ Shouting Orders In German ] - WHY DOES A SPY RISK HIS LIFE-- FOR WHAT POSSIBLE REASONS? IF THE SPY WINS, HE'S IGNORED. IF HE LOSES, HE'S SHOT. [ Continues Shouting Orders ] [ Bell Tolling In Distance ] BUT A MAN STAYS ALIVE AS LONG AS HE'S REMEMBERED AND IS KILLED ONLY BY FORGETFULNESS. LET THE NAMES OF MEN LIKE THIS REMAIN UNKNOWN, BUT LET THE MEMORIES OF SOME OF THEM SERVE AS KEYS TO THE MEANINGS OF TREASON. [ Shouting In German ] [ Speaking German ] [ Shell Incoming ] ON THE 8th OF DECEMBER, 1944, SIX MONTHS AFTER A PIECE OF ENEMY SHRAPNEL... CUT SHORT MY CAREER WITH THE SECOND ASSAULT AND SIGNAL COMPANY ON OMAHA BEACH, I WAS REASSIGNED BY HEADQUARTERS, COM. "Z", E.T.O.... AND ORDERED TO REPORT TO A NEW OUTFIT-- G2, S.S.S., SEVENTH ARMY. THAT'S WHAT IT WAS CALLED. THERE'D BEEN NO SNOW AND A LOT OF KRAUTS WHEN I LEFT FRANCE. AND NOW THE KRAUTS WERE BACKED UP AGAINST THE RHINE, AND THE SNOW WAS EVERYWHERE. OTHERWISE, THE WAR HADN'T CHANGED MUCH-- CROWDED IN THE REAR AREAS... AND LONELY AS YOU GOT NEARER AND NEARER THE FRONT... WITH NOTHING BUT A MAP TO TELL YOU WHERE THE ENEMY WAS SUPPOSED TO BE. BUT YOU SOON DISCOVERED IF YOUR MAP WAS ACCURATE ENOUGH. HEY, WHAT'S THAT? - IT'S A GERMAN HALF-TRACK. THAT'S WHAT IT IS. I DON'T GET IT. THAT WASN'T HERE WHEN I CAME BY THIS MORNING. WELL, LET'S TURN AROUND HERE AND FIND OUT WHERE WE ARE. - YES, SIR. STOP RIGHT HERE. - YES, SIR. I'M SORRY, SIR. I KEEP TELLIN' 'EM BACK AT HEADQUARTERS, I GOT NO SENSE OF DIRECTION, BUT THEY JUST WON'T LISTEN TO ME. A SOLDIER'S NOT MUCH GOOD IF HE CAN'T FIND HIS WAY BACK TO HIS OWN OUTFIT. IT'S LIKE NOT BEIN' ABLE TO FIND YOUR WAY HOME. - MY HOME? MY HOME'S IN BOISE. FOR CRYIN' OUT-- WE'VE COME 20 MILES OUT OF THE WAY. NOW WE'LL PROBABLY HAVE TO FIGHT OUR WAY THROUGH A WHOLE KRAUT-- [ Branch Cracks ] COME ON. GET OUTTA THERE! GIVE IT UP, YOU RATS. COME ON! MOVE IT ON! KEEP YOUR HANDS UP. OVER THIS WAY. MOVE! - COME ON. GET THE LEAD OUT. MOVE OVER THERE. THAT'S CLOSE ENOUGH. RIGHT THERE. YOU FRISK 'EM. I'LL KEEP 'EM COVERED. HEY, YOU. I SAID, KEEP YOUR HANDS UP. THAT'S WHAT I MEANT. COME ON! STAND STILL. WATCH THOSE HANDS, SOLDIER. - HE WAS HIT BY SHRAPNEL, SIR. - YOU'RE IN THE LUFTWAFFE. WHAT ARE YOU DOIN' AROUND HERE? - I'M WITH A FLAK GROUP. WE'RE ATTACHED TO AN INFANTRY DIVISION. - YEAH? WHICH ONE? I'M SORRY, SIR, BUT I CAN'T TELL YOU ANYTHING THAT ISN'T IN MY SOLDBUCH. WANT ME TO REFRESH HIS MEMORY, LIEUTENANT? - AH, LEAVE HIM ALONE. WHERE'S YOUR C.P.? I DON'T KNOW. WE GOT LOST. [ Sniffles ] THEY'RE NOT THE ONLY ONES. "RICHTER, PAUL. UNTEROFFIZIER." HE'S WEAK, SIR. WE HAVEN'T EATEN FOR THREE DAYS. NOT HALF AS WEAK AS HE'S GONNA BE IF YOU DON'T KEEP THOSE HANDS UP. - HERE. YOU LOOK LIKE YOU COULD USE A SHOT YOURSELF. - NO, THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. CLIMB ABOARD. ALL RIGHT. OUT, SOLDIERS. WHERE'D YOU PICK 'EM UP, LIEUTENANT? - ABOUT FIVE MILES FROM HERE. OVER HERE, YOU TWO. HEY, I'M SUPPOSED TO REPORT TO A TOWN CALLED MARMOUTIER. YOU KNOW WHERE THAT IS? STAY ON THIS ROAD TILL YOU GET TO A TOWN CALLED SAVERNE. BEFORE YOU GET INTO TOWN, TAKE THE FIRST FORK LEFT. YOU CAN'T MISS IT. OKAY. THANKS. HEY, HERE'S THEIR SOLDBUCHS. HEY, YOU WANT THE PISTOL, LIEUTENANT? - YEAH. GIMME THAT. PISTOL. - IN THERE, YOU TWO. [ M.P. ] COME ON. I WANT TO THANK YOU, SIR, FOR TREATING US WITH KINDNESS. COME ON, KRAUT-HEADS. GET MOVIN'. YOU'RE HOLDIN' UP THE WAR. [ Lieutenant Narrating ] WELL, WE FINALLY MADE IT. STRANGE AS IT SEEMED TO ME THEN, THIS WAS THE HEADQUARTERS TO WHICH I WAS ASSIGNED. [ Beeping Horn ] JUST A MOMENT, SIR. SISTER TERESA'S COMING. BONJOUR, MONSIEUR JEAN. - HOW WAS THE HUNTING THIS MORNING? NO GOOD, SISTER BEATRICE. THERE WASN'T A CHICKEN ON THE ROAD. THIS IS IT, SIR. SORRY ABOUT GETTING LOST. - OH, FORGET IT. I JUST HOPE THIS IS THE RIGHT PLACE. - THROUGH HERE, SIR. THE ADJUTANT'S OFFICE IS RIGHT IN THE COURTYARD. I'LL GET THE BAGS TO YOUR ROOM. [ Bell Tolling In Distance ] HEY, BUD, HOW DO I GET TO THE ADJUTANT? AROUND THE CORNER TO YOUR LEFT, SIR. HEY, MONIQUE, WILL YOU SHOW THE LIEUTENANT THE WAY? YOU WISH TO SEE LE CAPITAINE? - YEAH, I GUESS SO. THIS WAY, PLEASE. THE CHILDREN ARE FROM THE ORPHANAGE HERE. - OH. OF COURSE. HERE YOU ARE, SIR. - THANK YOU. MONSIEUR WATKINS, THE OFFICER WANTS TO SEE CAPITAINE SIEBERT. - WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU? THIS THE HEADQUARTERS OF G2, S.S.S.? - THAT'S RIGHT. I'VE GOT ORDERS TO REPORT HERE. OH. YOU'RE THE NEW COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER. COLONEL DEVLIN WILL SURE BE GLAD TO SEE YOU. IF YOU'LL FOLLOW ME, PLEASE. MM! COULD I SEE YOUR A.G.O. CARD? SORRY. SECURITY REGULATIONS. THANKS. MORNING, SISTER GENEVIEVE. HOW ARE YOU TODAY? [ Speaking French ] THE SISTERS CERTAINLY TAKE GOOD CARE OF US. THEY'VE ADOPTED US JUST LIKE THEIR ORPHANS. YEAH. IT'S QUITE A PLACE. WE HAD A HARD TIME FINDING ONE UNTIL CAPTAIN SIEBERT LOCATED THIS. WE DON'T LIKE TO BE TOO CLOSE TO THE ARMY. SOMETIMES THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND OUR PROCEDURE. I CAN SEE THEIR POINT. AFTER FIVE YEARS, THEY'RE FIXING THE PLACE UP AGAIN. OUR GUYS ARE TRYIN' TO HELP. UP HERE? - YES, SIR. WATKINS, SIR. - WHAT IS IT, WATKINS? THIS IS OUR NEW COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER. HERE'S HIS ORDERS, SIR. LT. RENNICK, REPORTING FOR DUTY. GLAD YOU FINALLY GOT HERE. SIT DOWN. I'LL BE WITH YOU IN A MINUTE. WHERE WAS I? "THAT THE INTELLIGENCE PENETRATION"-- - OH, YES. THAT THE INTELLIGENCE PENETRATION OF GERMANY BY FRENCH OR ALSATIAN AGENTS... OR BY ANY NON-GERMAN PERSONNEL IS PRACTICALLY AN IMPOSSIBILITY. OKAY, SIMONSON? YES, SIR. - NOW FOR THE ROUGH PART. I ASK THAT YOU RECONSIDER OUR REQUEST WITH THE USE OF GERMAN PRISONERS OF WAR IN OUR WORK. WE'VE ALREADY LOCATED MANY PROMISING CANDIDATES IN SEVERAL P.W. CAMPS. HOW ABOUT THE MEN DOWN AT THE SARREBOURG CAGE? THEY SAID THEY'D HOLD 'EM ANOTHER DAY OR TWO, SIR. - ALL RIGHT. THESE MEN, I BELIEVE, IF PROPERLY TRAINED AND USED, CAN HELP SAVE AMERICAN LIVES. WE INTEND TO TAKE ONLY VOLUNTEERS, AND IN THAT CASE-- [ Phone Ringing ] PINPOINT FORWARD. CAPTAIN SIEBERT SPEAKING. YES, HE'S HERE. JUST A MINUTE. G2 SEVENTH ARMY, SIR. DEVLIN SPEAKING. YES, SIR. THEN WE CAN GO AHEAD AS DISCUSSED? WELL, I'M SURE YOU WON'T REGRET IT. THANK YOU, SIR. BYE. FORGET THE MEMO. THE OLD BOY CAME THROUGH. ARMY SAYS, TRY IT OUT. THAT'S VERY GRACIOUS OF THEM. - THIS CALLS FOR A DRINK, DON'T YOU THINK, COLONEL? RIGHT. BREAK OUT THE QUETCH, HAROLD. - AYE, AYE, SIR. OH, I'M SORRY. I FORGOT TO INTRODUCE YOU. - THIS IS GEVERS, RECRUITING. - HI. MAJOR RICHARDS, OUR EXEC. - WELCOME TO OUR CLUB. VINCENT, DOCUMENTS. - HELLO, LIEUTENANT. SIEBERT-- WHERE IS HE? OH. SIEBERT, SECURITY. GLAD TO MEET YOU, LIEUTENANT. - SERGEANT SIMONSON, BEST RED TAPE SPECIALIST, BOTH SIDES OF THE ATLANTIC. - THANK YOU, SIR. THIS IS LIEUTENANT, UH-- WHAT WAS YOUR NAME AGAIN? - RENNICK. THAT'S RIGHT. LIEUTENANT RENNICK. OUR NEW COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER. RICHARDS, WE'LL WANT TRANSPORTATION FIRST THING IN THE MORNING FOR SARREBOURG. WELL, WE'RE FINALLY GONNA PAY A VISIT TO YOUR GERMAN FRIENDS, PETE. PARDON ME, BUT IF I MAY, I'D LIKE TO TALK WITH YOU ABOUT MY DUTIES. WELL, IT CAN WAIT TILL MORNING, CAN'T IT? HOW ABOUT COMING TO SARREBOURG? IT'LL GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT. VOTRE SANTÉ, MESSIEURS-- OR SHOULD I SAY, PROST. [ Others ] PROST! NO, SIR. NOT ME. WHEN A MAN GETS HIS LIFE HANDED BACK TO HIM LIKE I JUST DID, HE'D BE A FOOL TO PUT IT UP FOR SALE AGAIN. I'LL DO ANY KIND OF WORK YOU WANT, BUT-- [ Gevers ] NEXT MAN. I HAVE NEVER BEEN INTERESTED IN POLITICS. THEY FORCED ME TO JOIN THE PARTY. IT WAS THE ONLY WAY I COULD GET A PROMOTION. ALL RIGHT. NEXT MAN. [ No Audible Dialogue ] [ Stamps Heels ] - SERGEANT RUDOLPH BARTH REPORTING, SIR. AT EASE, SERGEANT. SIT DOWN. YOU SMOKE? - YES, SIR. I DO. DICK? THANK YOU. - UH, NOT NOW. WHAT UNIT WERE YOU WITH WHEN CAPTURED? [ Blows ] TWENTY-FOURTH INFANTRY-- OR WHAT WAS LEFT OF IT. DID YOU DESERT? - NO, SIR. I WAS CAUGHT BY ONE OF YOUR PATROLS WHILE, UH-- WHILE VISITING THE WIFE OF AN ALSATIAN FARMER. SHE WAS A VERY LONELY WOMAN, SIR. HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN IN THE WEHRMACHT, BARTH? SINCE '41, UNFORTUNATELY. - AND BEFORE THAT? I WORKED IN A PANZER FACTORY IN HAMBURG, AND BEFORE THAT I WAS WITH THE CIRCUS. YES, SIR. I TOOK CARE OF TWO TIGERS AND A LION-- A LIONESS TO BE EXACT. I LOST MY JOB WHEN THE OLD WOMAN DIED. - HAVE YOU EVER BEEN IN JAIL? - YES SIR, IN '36 IN DÜSSELDORF AND IN '42 IN NORWAY. - AND WHAT WERE THE CHARGES? IN CIVILIAN LIFE, THEFT, AND IN THE ARMY-- HOW SHALL I SAY-- UH, INSUBORDINATION. I HOPE IT WON'T COUNT AGAINST ME. - AND WHAT ARE YOUR POLITICAL CONVICTIONS? - MY POLITICAL CONVICTIONS? NEVER BEEN ABLE TO AFFORD ANY. - THEN WHY DO YOU WANT TO WORK FOR US? BECAUSE YOU ARE WINNING THE WAR. ISN'T THAT A GOOD ENOUGH REASON? WELL, GOOD OR BAD, I SUPPOSE IT'S A VALID ONE. IN OTHER WORDS, YOU DON'T MIND THE GENERAL DISASTER, AS LONG AS YOU COME OUT AHEAD. IF YOU WANT TO PUT IT THAT WAY. I GUESS A FEW YEARS AGO, FOR THE SAME REASON, YOU WERE SHOUTING, "SIEG HEIL." NO. NOT THAT. THAT WAS ONE SWINDLE I NEVER FELL FOR. THEY WERE TOO MUCH LIKE MY CATS TO SUIT ME-- DANGEROUS TO TURN YOUR BACK ON. WOULD YOU WORK FOR US EVEN IF IT MEANT RISKING YOUR LIFE? I DIDN'T EXPECT THE JOB TO BE SAFE OR PLEASANT. WHY SHOULD YOU TAKE GERMANS FOR SAFE WORK WHEN YOUR OWN PEOPLE ARE IN DANGER? ALL RIGHT, SERGEANT. WE'LL THINK ABOUT IT. [ Gevers ] NEXT. THIS NEXT GUY'S SUPPOSED TO BE AN EXPERIENCED RADIOMAN. PARDON ME. MAY I ASK YOU A QUESTION NOW, SIR? - WHAT IS IT? - HOW MUCH DO YOU PAY? - [ Tweets On Whistle ] THANKS A LOT, SERGEANT. DON'T FORGET TO KEEP OUR GUYS SEPARATED FROM THE OTHERS. I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN, SIR. I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT. THIS WAY, SIR. LOOK. - I WONDER WHAT HE'S DOING HERE. DON'T YOU KNOW? THEY LOOK FOR VOLUNTEERS WHO WILL WORK FOR THEM. HAVE THEY FOUND ANY? - YES. BUT THERE ARE MEN HERE WHO WILL REMEMBER THEIR NAMES. AND SOMEDAY, WHEN WE'VE WON, THEY'LL BE TAKEN CARE OF. "WHEN WE'VE WON"? YOU STILL BELIEVE IN THAT? [ Whistle Tweets ] HERE THEY COME-- THE VOLUNTEERS. LOOK AT THEM. THEY ARE READY TO DO ANYTHING JUST TO SAVE THEIR OWN HIDES. LIKE MOST OF US. - WHAT DID YOU SAY? YES, WE ARE NO DIFFERENT FROM THEM. WE DIDN'T CARE WHAT HAPPENED TO OTHERS AS LONG AS THEY DIDN'T BOTHER ANY OF US. WE JUST CLOSED OUR EYES AND WENT ALONG UNTIL WE FOUND OURSELVES FORCED TO FIGHT THE WRONG ENEMY. YOU SOUND AS IF YOU'RE ALL SET TO JOIN THE AMERICANS YOURSELF. I DON'T KNOW. THAT TAKES COURAGE. THE TROUBLE WITH ME IS I WANT TO STAY ALIVE. LIKE MOST OF US, I TALK BUT I DO NOTHING. ¶ [ Harmonicas In Distance ] ¶ [ Continues ] PAUL? PAUL, ARE YOU ASLEEP? NO. WHAT IS IT? DID YOU SEE THEIR FACES THIS MORNING OUT IN THE YARD? YES. FOR SOME OF THEM, NOTHING IS CHANGED-- EVEN NOW. RICHTER, THE AMIS WANT YOU FOR QUESTIONING. THE AMERICANS WANT ME NOW? - YES. COME WITH ME. [ German P.W. ] SERGEANT PAUL RICHTER, YOU ARE FACING A COURT-MARTIAL OF THE WEHRMACHT. YOU ARE ACCUSED OF TREASON AGAINST YOUR FÜHRER AND YOUR FATHERLAND. HAVE YOU ANYTHING TO SAY IN YOUR DEFENSE? WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? - EAVESDROPPING, EH? GET IT OVER WITH. QUICK! [ Richter Screaming ] [ Body Thuds ] [ Siren Wailing In Distance ] [ Whistle Blowing ] [ M.P. ] WHAT HAPPENED? [ M.P. #2 ] ONE OF THE P.W.'s FELL OUT OF THE WINDOW. [ M.P. ] LET'S GET HIM INSIDE BEFORE THERE'S MORE TROUBLE. [ M.P. #2 ] HEY, YOU FELLAS, COME OVER WITH THAT LIGHT. - ALL RIGHT. BREAK IT UP, GUYS. - COME ON. THERE'S NOTHING TO LOOK AT. BREAK IT UP, I SAID. GET BACK TO YOUR BUNKS. WHICH ROOM DID THE GUY FALL FROM? - FALL? ARE YOU KIDDING? HE WAS PUSHED. BETTER KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT, JUNGE. [ M.P. ] ALL RIGHT. LET'S GO. WELL, WHAT ABOUT YOU? LET'S GO. MONSIEUR RENNICK. MONSIEUR RENNICK. - YEAH? SERGEANT WATKINS ASKED ME TO TELL YOU, THERE IS A GERMAN TO SEE YOU DOWNSTAIRS. A SOLDIER. MORNING, GRIFFIN. - MORNING, SIR. YOU WANTED TO SEE ME? WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT? I REMEMBERED YOU FROM THE MORNING I WAS CAPTURED, SIR. I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU CAN HELP ME. THE MORNING YOU WERE CAPTURED? DON'T YOU REMEMBER THOSE KRAUTS WE PICKED UP IN HAGENAU WOODS? OH, YEAH. HOW'S YOUR FRIEND DOIN'? HE WAS KILLED, SIR, TEN DAYS AGO. HE WAS KILLED? BY WHOM? HE WAS MURDERED BY SOME OF THE OTHER PRISONERS. - YEAH, I HEARD ABOUT THAT. HE WAS PUSHED OUT OF A WINDOW, WASN'T HE? - YES. COFFEE, DICK? - NO, THANKS. IS THAT WHY YOU CAME HERE? - NO, SIR. IT IS-- WELL, I WANT TO WORK FOR YOU, AND I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP ME. - YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GETTIN' INTO? - IT DOESN'T MATTER. EVEN IF IT MEANS FIGHTING AGAINST YOUR OWN PEOPLE? I BELIEVE FIGHTING AGAINST THEM NOW IS FIGHTING FOR THEM. YOU SURE IT ISN'T THE MURDER OF YOUR FRIEND THAT'S PROMPTING YOU TO DO THIS? NO, SIR. THAT WAS ONLY THE LAST THING THAT HAPPENED. SIT DOWN. - THANK YOU. LOOK, IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS, BUT THE JOB YOU'LL HAVE TO DO HERE... ISN'T AS CLEAN AND SIMPLE AS YOU MAY THINK. I DON'T FEEL THERE'S ANY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ONE WAY OF FIGHTING OR ANOTHER. ISN'T THE IMPORTANT THING TO BELIEVE IN WHAT YOU'RE FIGHTING FOR? WELL, WHAT DO YOU BELIEVE IN? DO YOU KNOW? OR DOES IT CHANGE WHEN YOUR CROWD'S TAKING A BEATING? PETE, GOT A CIGARETTE? SIT DOWN, CORPORAL. DON'T LET ME INTERRUPT. THANK YOU, SIR. - GO AHEAD. WHAT DO YOU BELIEVE IN? I DON'T QUITE KNOW HOW TO SAY IT, BUT I BELIEVE IN A LIFE IN WHICH ONE IS NOT ALWAYS AFRAID, IN A LIFE IN WHICH PEOPLE ARE FREE AND HONEST WITH EACH OTHER. AND I KNOW WE WON'T HAVE THIS IN GERMANY... UNTIL-- UNTIL WE HAVE LOST. THAT SOUNDS GREAT. WHAT MAKES YOU SO SURE YOU'LL BE ABLE TO STICK TO THESE CONVICTIONS? THINGS WILL CHANGE. YOU'LL BE FACING YOUR OWN PEOPLE. IT MAY BECOME HARD FOR YOU THEN TO HOLD ON TO YOUR BELIEFS. NO, NOT ANY HARDER THAN IT HAS BEEN. NOT ANY HARDER THAN FIGHTING FOR SOMETHING I KNEW WAS WRONG. YOU WERE A MEDIC. YOU DIDN'T REALLY FIGHT. TO BE THERE IS TO FIGHT. THERE'S SOMETHING IN WHAT YOU SAY, CORPORAL. GRIFFIN. GRIFFIN! YES, SIR? - TELL MAJOR RICHARDS I WANT TO KEEP THIS MAN HERE A FEW DAYS. YES, SIR. - WE'LL LET YOU KNOW. [ Stamps Heels ] THIS WAY. SEEMS LIKE A DECENT KID. WHAT DO YOU THINK, PETE? YEAH, QUITE UNUSUAL IN THIS RACKET. AS A MATTER OF FACT, HE LOOKS LIKE ONE OF THE FEW KRAUTS WE CAN TRUST. HOW ABOUT YOU, RENNICK? I'M A SIGNAL OFFICER, SIR. I'M SORRY, I... REALLY HAVE NO OPINION ABOUT ANY OF THEM. THAT DIDN'T SEEM TO BE THE CASE A MOMENT AGO. THE WAY YOU TALKED TO THIS KID SOUNDED AS IF YOU HAD A PRETTY DEFINITE POINT OF VIEW. WHAT IS IT? - WELL, IF YOU WANT TO KNOW, SIR, I-- I THINK THEY'RE ALL A BUNCH OF LICE. IF I HAD TO MAKE A CHOICE, I'D GO ALONG WITH THIS GUY FROM THE CIRCUS. HE'S A CROOK, BUT AT LEAST HE DOESN'T KID HIMSELF ABOUT WHY HE'S WORKIN' FOR US. I THINK YOU'RE WRONG ABOUT THE BOY, RENNICK. THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF TRAITORS. I HAVE NO MORE SYMPATHY WITH 'EM THAN YOU. BUT OUR PERSONAL FEELINGS ARE UNIMPORTANT AS LONG AS THESE MEN ARE SERVING OUR CAUSE. THAT'S WHY FROM NOW ON, WHEN YOU'RE ON THE JOB, YOU'LL HAVE ONLY ONE OPINION-- AND THAT'S THE RIGHT ONE FOR THE JOB. EVERYTHING SET FOR TONIGHT? - YES. 0200 HOURS. TIGER AND FREDDY. BE SURE AND CHECK THEIR BRIEFING BEFORE YOU TAKE THEM THROUGH. IT'S THEIR FIRST TIME. OH, AND PETE, I WANT LIEUTENANT RENNICK TO GO ALONG. IT MAY DO YOU SOME GOOD. THAT'S ALL. SEE YOU LATER. [ Door Opens, Closes ] [ Rennick Narrating ] 0200 HOURS. A PIECE OF NO-MAN'S-LAND... WAS INDICATED BY DIVISION G2 AS A SPOT WHERE TWO OF OUR AGENTS, KNOWN AS TIGER AND FREDDY, WERE TO BE SMUGGLED THROUGH ENEMY LINES. THEY WERE TO SECURE INFORMATION ON S.S. AND ELITE TROOPS IN THIS SECTOR. IT WAS... A SO-CALLED "TOURIST" MISSION. [ Machine Gunfire, Explosions In Distance ] [ Gunfire, Closer ] - MINEFIELD. WAIT HERE. - MINEFIELD. WAIT. - MINES. REMEMBER, THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS EXACT MAP COORDINATES FOR YOUR REPORT. NO REPORT AT ALL IS BETTER THAN ONE IN WHICH YOU'RE NOT 100% SURE. THAT'S SIMPLE. WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS-- - JUST LET ME DO THE TALKIN'. TIGER, WHAT I WAS TRYIN' TO SAY IS SOMETIMES, OUT OF AMBITION, YOU'RE APT TO EXAGGERATE-- REPORT THINGS YOU HAVEN'T SEEN. ME? I NEVER LIE. - THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I MEANT. YOU MAY NOT LIE, BUT YOU CERTAINLY EXAGGERATE. OKAY. WE CAN GO NOW. SINGLE FILE. - COME ON. SINGLE FILE. THE CAPTAIN SAID HE'D GIVE US A SHORT ARTILLERY BARRAGE JUST FOR COVER. IT SHOULD START AT ANY MOMENT NOW. [ Explosions ] THAT'S IT. BETTER GET THEM READY, LIEUTENANT. OKAY? - FREDDY, YOU FIRST. DON'T FORGET, YOUR DANGER SIGNAL'S A GROUP OF FIVE "D's." TIME OF TRANSMISSION-- 2400. I WANT TO ASK A QUESTION. - WHAT IS IT? WHO IS THE CAPTAIN OF THE TEAM? WHO IS IN COMMAND? - QUIET! YOU ARE, TIGER. AND YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR TEAMMATE. - ALL RIGHT. AS LONG AS I KNOW. OKAY. GOOD LUCK TO BOTH OF YOU. - GO AHEAD. I'LL FOLLOW YOU. OKAY. BUT REMEMBER, FROM NOW ON I'M GIVING ORDERS. LET'S GO. NORTH. JUST KEEP TO YOUR LEFT. WE'LL STOP 'EM IN JUST A MOMENT. THE GERMAN LINES ARE ABOUT 300 YARDS OVER THERE. [ Vehicle Approaching ] [ Man ] ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR. ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR. ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR. DEDE, TAKE OVER. - HEY, LANG, HERE'S A NEW GUEST FOR YOUR HOTEL. [ Lang ] YEAH. I KNOW ALL ABOUT HIM. OVER HERE. READY? EXERCISE. ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR. ONE, TWO-- MONIQUE. HEY, MONIQUE. THIS IS THE MAN WE GOT THE FILE ON THIS MORNING. CODE NAME'S "HAPPY." YES, SIR. I'LL-- I'LL PUT HIM IN WITH TIGER AND FRITZ. WELL, LOTSA LUCK. YOU'RE IN GOOD HANDS NOW. - FOLLOW ME, PLEASE. [ Dede Continues Leading Calisthenics In Distance ] THE COT NEAR THE WINDOW. YOU MAKE YOUR OWN BED HERE. ALL PERSONAL BELONGINGS WILL BE TURNED OVER TO ME, AND YOU WILL GET A RECEIPT FOR THEM. AND WHAT ABOUT MY WALLET? THEY TOOK IT AWAY FROM ME. I HAD A COUPLE OF PHOTOGRAPHS OF MY MOTHER AND FATHER. I WOULD LIKE TO KEEP THEM IF POSSIBLE. ALL YOUR PERSONAL DOCUMENTS WILL BE KEPT IN THE HEADQUARTERS' SAFE UNTIL THE WAR IS OVER. YOU HAVE BEEN TOLD YOUR CODE NAME IS "HAPPY"? - YES. AS YOU WILL SEE BY THIS LIST OF REGULATIONS, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES... WILL YOU REVEAL YOUR TRUE NAME OR IDENTITY TO ANYONE. REMEMBER THAT. ALL RIGHT NOW, HAPPY. HO-O-OLD IT. GOOD. [ Richards ] FATHER'S NAME? - FRIEDRICH MAURER. PROFESSION? - A DOCTOR. HE'S A SURGEON. WHEN DID YOU LAST SEE HIM? - UH, ABOUT A YEAR AGO IN BERLIN. HE WAS IN CHARGE OF THE HOSPITAL THERE. I THOUGHT IN AMERICA ONLY CRIMINALS WERE FINGERPRINTED. [ Lang ] COME ON, BOYS. COME ON. COME ON. OVER HERE. OVER HERE. COME ON. LET'S GO. HURRY UP. HERE IS AN EXAMPLE OF THE WEHRMACHT BLACKLIST. IT'S THE GREATEST SINGLE DANGER THAT CONFRONTS AN AGENT IN THE REICH. IT CARRIES THE NAMES OF ALL SUSPECTS. IT'S BROUGHT UP TO DATE BY A WEEKLY SUPPLEMENT... WHICH CARRIES THE NUMBER OF THE WEEK ON ITS COVER. HEY, WHAT'S THE MATTER, HAPPY? - MOVE IT OUT. COME ON. STAY ON YOUR FEET. DON'T LET THAT CHUTE DRAG YOU. NO. PULL HARD ON THE BOTTOM LINE. RENNICK! RENNICK-- [ Rennick ] YES, SIR. WHEN WAS OUR LAST RADIO CONTACT WITH FREDDY? - ABOUT FOUR NIGHTS AGO. DID HE SEND HIS DANGER SIGNAL? - NO. HE CAME IN ON SCHEDULE-- STAYED ON THE AIR FOR ABOUT 20 MINUTES, FROM MIDNIGHT ON. ACCORDING TO YOUR NOTES, WASN'T THAT THE EVENING HE SAID HE LAST SAW HIM? YES, SIR-- AT APPROXIMATELY 9:00. WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO ASSUME-- LIEUTENANT RENNICK IS LYING AND YOU'RE TELLING THE TRUTH? I DON'T KNOW I... MAY HAVE MADE A MISTAKE. I'M SORRY. - YOU MAY HAVE MADE A MISTAKE. WE WARNED YOU BEFORE YOU LEFT THAT YOU WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SAFETY OF YOUR TEAMMATE. YOU SHOW UP WITH A STORY. HE WAS PICKED UP BY THE WEHRMACHT AND SHIPPED TO THE EASTERN FRONT. I'M TELLING THE TRUTH. I WARNED HIM NOT TO GO OUT AT NIGHT, BUT HE WOULDN'T LISTEN. HOW DO YOU KNOW THEY SHIPPED HIM TO THE EASTERN FRONT? - I HAD FRIENDS IN MANNHEIM. ONE OF THEM CHECKED ON IT. - WAIT A MINUTE. DIDN'T YOU SAY BEFORE... YOU COULDN'T GET ALONG WITH FREDDY-- YOU HAD SOME KIND OF AN ARGUMENT? - WERE YOU LYIN' THEN OR NOW? - I AM NOT LYING, SIR. YES, WE HAD AN ARGUMENT. I GOT MAD AND HIT HIM. AND HE-- HE RAN OUT IN THE STREET. WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US THAT BEFORE? - I DID. I JUST DIDN'T SAY IT WAS THE SAME NIGHT. I... WAS FRIGHTENED, THAT'S ALL. YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO, BEFORE SUMMER IS OVER WE'LL BE IN GERMANY, IN EVERY CITY AND TOWN. IF YOU'VE BETRAYED US, DOUBLE AGENT OR PLAIN CROOK YOU'LL WIND UP IN FRONT OF A FIRING SQUAD. I HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. I HAVEN'T BEEN DISLOYAL, SIR. I HAVEN'T-- GET HIM OUT OF HERE. WATKINS. - YES, SIR. COME ON! GIVE ME A CHANCE TO PROVE WHAT I'VE SAID IS TRUE. - GET OUT! GOT A CIGARETTE, RENNICK? NOT THE BEST LIAR I'VE HEARD, BUT CERTAINLY THE BIGGEST. WONDER HOW MUCH KRAUTS PAID HIM. PETE, I WANT HIM SENT BACK TO THE JOE HOUSE AND TREATED AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED. SIEBERT, GET C.I.C. ON IT RIGHT AWAY, AND TELL 'EM IT'S URGENT. - YES, SIR. [ Siebert ] HELLO. GET ME CAPTAIN HENDRICKSON, 708 CADET FORWARD, PLEASE. I KNOW IT SOUNDS CRAZY, BUT HE MAY BE TELLING THE TRUTH. HE'S TOO SMART A LIAR TO LIE THAT BADLY. WELL, WHAT'S NEW IN COMPANY "D"? SAY, YOU KNOW WHAT THE "D" STANDS FOR? "THE DAMNED." THAT'S WHAT WE ARE. HERE, MONIQUECHEN. IF ANYONE DESERVES A SECOND HELPING TONIGHT, I DO. I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU, THE FOOD ON THE OTHER SIDE OF OUR GLORIOUS RHINE STINKS. WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH ALL OF YOU? I GO OUT AND DO A JOB WHILE THE REST OF YOU SIT HERE BY THE FIRE, AND WHEN I COME BACK YOU LOOK AT ME AS IF-- - WELL, FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE, SAY SOMETHING. - WHAT HAPPENED TO FREDDY? HE WAS YOUR TEAMMATE, WASN'T HE? - SURE HE WAS, AND HE GOT CAUGHT. SO WHAT? THAT'S A CHANCE EVERYONE OF US TAKES. ANYWAY, I REMEMBER NONE OF YOU WERE THIS UPSET ABOUT RED WHEN HE GOT LOST. RED? THAT WAS DIFFERENT. - HOW DO YOU KNOW IT WAS? WHAT DO ANY OF YOU KNOW ABOUT IT, HUH? NOTHING. [ Dede ] LISTEN TO HIM TALK. FREDDY GOT CAUGHT BECAUSE HE WASN'T SMART ENOUGH. HE WAS DUMB, THICK-HEADED-- LIKE THE REST OF YOU! [ All Shouting ] [ Lang ] SILENCE, TIGER! [ Shouting Stops ] AND KNOCK IT OFF, ALL OF YA'S. ¶ [ Accordion: Waltz ] ALL RIGHT. FORGET IT. HERE. YOU HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN THE OLD SONG, "WILL THIS ALL BE REMEMBERED"? WELL, THEY ARE PLAYING IT ALL OVER AGAIN. ¶ [ Continues ] UM, MAY I HAVE A CUP OF COFFEE, PLEASE? - SURE. WHO WAS RED? - A BOY WHO MISSED HIS PINPOINT. HE DIDN'T JUMP WHEN THE GREEN LIGHT WENT ON. HE LANDED 20 MILES OFF HIS TARGET OUTSIDE AN S.S. BARRACKS... WITH HIS PARACHUTE TANGLED IN A TREE. IT DOESN'T HAPPEN OFTEN. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE AFRAID. I'M NOT-- NOT OF THE JUMP, ANYWAY. THEN WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF? I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T MEAN TO BE INQUISITIVE. OH, THAT'S ALL RIGHT. I DON'T MIND. YOU KNOW, ONCE I WAS DOING THE SAME JOB, AND I, TOO, WAS AFRAID THE FIRST TIME I JUMPED. MAYBE IN A DIFFERENT WAY, BUT THAT'S WHY I THINK I KNOW WHAT'S BOTHERING YOU. YOU DO? WHAT IS IT? YOU ARE AFRAID OF HAVING TO FACE YOUR OWN PEOPLE, AREN'T YOU? ¶ [ Accordion Ends ] COME IN. OFFICER MESSENGER, SIR, WITH A DISPATCH. - YES? COLONEL DEVLIN? - THAT'S RIGHT. THIS IS FROM COLONEL WILLIAMSON, SIR. TOP SECRET. ¶ [ Pipe Organ: Sacred ] COME ON. HURRY IT UP. BRINGIN' YOU GUYS TOGETHER IS GETTING TOUGHER EVERY DAY. [ Man ] WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT, ANYWAY? [ Gevers ] SHH. QUIET. ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN, HERE'S THE DOPE. GENERAL JAEGER, COMMANDING THE FOURTH CORPS HERE ALONG THE EAST BANK OF THE RHINE... SENT EMISSARIES TO SWITZERLAND INFORMING US HE'S WILLING TO SURRENDER HIS ENTIRE CORPS... AS SOON AS HE CAN ESTABLISH CONTACT WITH OUR TROOPS. HE'S ALSO REQUESTED THAT WE PUT IN A RADIO MISSION HIDDEN HERE IN MANNHEIM... TO ACT AS A COMMUNICATIONS LINK BETWEEN HIS HEADQUARTERS AND US. IS THAT CLEAR? SURE. - WELL, LOOKS AS IF THE KRAUTS HAVE FINALLY WISED UP. G2 HAS APPROVED JAEGER'S REQUEST AND ASKED THAT WE PUT IN A TOURIST MISSION... ABOUT 250 MILES BEHIND THIS SECTOR HERE IN THE VICINITY OF MUNICH TO FIND OUT HOW MUCH... MOBILE STRENGTH THE GERMANS CAN BRING UP TO CLOSE IN THE GAP IN CASE THE SURRENDER COMES OFF. G2 ALSO SUSPECTS THAT ELEMENTS OF THE 11th PANZER CORPS... ARE BEING HELD BACK HERE AS A MOBILE RESERVE TO BE THROWN IN WHEREVER NEEDED. NOW THE MANNHEIM JOB WILL REQUIRE A TEAM OF ONE RADIO OPERATOR... AND A FIRST-CLASS AGENT WHO REALLY KNOWS THE TOWN AND HAS CONTACTS THERE HE CAN DEPEND ON. WHO'VE YOU GOT IN MIND, COLONEL? - NOW DON'T ALL JUMP ON ME. THE ONLY MAN WHO CAN DO IT IS OUR FRIEND BARTH, THE TIGER. [ Others Protest ] HERE'S THE C.I.C. REPORT THAT CAME IN YESTERDAY ON THE TIGER'S FIRST MISSION. THEY CHECKED HIS STORY, AND IT SEEMS THAT EVERYTHING HE SAID WAS TRUE. FURTHERMORE G2 HAS GIVEN HIS INTELLIGENCE MISSION AN "A" RATING. BESIDES THAT, HE WAS-- - WAS BORN AND RAISED IN MANNHEIM. RIGHT. THAT'S WHY NO MATTER HOW WE FEEL ABOUT HIM, AT THE MOMENT HE'S THE LOGICAL CHOICE. WHAT ABOUT HIS TEAMMATE, THE RADIOMAN? I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THAT LATER. FIRST LET'S TAKE UP THE TOURIST MISSION. I WANT TO SEND HAPPY. ANY OBJECTIONS? NO, SIR. BUT, SO HELP ME, I DON'T GET SENDING THE TIGER. RICHARDS, IS MONIQUE HERE? - YES, SIR. SHE'S WAITING OUTSIDE. ASK HER TO COME IN. HOLD YOUR HORSES, PETE. HE'S NOT ON THE PLANE YET. OKAY, BOB? - YEAH. OKAY. COME IN, HONEY. SIT DOWN, MONIQUE. WOULD YOU CARE FOR A CUP OF COFFEE OR A CIGARETTE? CIGARETTE'S OKAY, SIR. TELL US ABOUT THE TIGER, MONIQUE. HAVE YOU NOTICED ANYTHING RECENTLY THAT WE SHOULD HEAR ABOUT? NO, SIR. HE HASN'T CHANGED. AS USUAL, HE DOESN'T GET ALONG WITH THE OTHERS, AND HE'S DIFFICULT, BUT THAT'S ALL. HOW WOULD YOU FEEL ABOUT SENDING HIM OUT AGAIN? - I WOULD SEND HIM, SIR. - I'M ALL FOR THAT, IF IT'S JUST TO GET RID OF HIM. - OKAY. HOW ABOUT HAPPY? I THINK THAT, IN MANY WAYS, HE'S THE BEST OF THEM ALL. - WHY? BECAUSE-- WELL, BECAUSE HE'S THE FIRST GERMAN... I'VE KNOWN WHO REALLY BELIEVES IN WHAT HE'S DOING. - DO YOU THINK HE'S READY TO GO? - ¶ [ Organ In Distance: "Ave Maria" ] - WHAT'S THE MATTER, MONIQUE? - ¶ [ Continues ] THERE IS ONLY ONE THING THAT MIGHT MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR HIM, MAYBE BECAUSE HE'S YOUNG AND HONEST. HE MAY BEGIN TO DOUBT HIMSELF ONCE HE'S BACK IN HIS OWN COUNTRY. IF THIS MISSION IS DIFFICULT, I THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER TO WAIT. ¶ [ Continues ] COME HERE A MINUTE, MONIQUE. ¶ [ Louder ] THEIR FIRST SERVICE SINCE THE GERMANS LEFT. ¶ [ Quieter ] LOOK, WE'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER FOR QUITE A WHILE.

I KNOW I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO COME HERE, BUT I SPENT LAST NIGHT-- - GET INSIDE. WHERE DID YOU GET THIS ADDRESS? - I HEARD TIGER GIVE IT TO YOU ON THE PLANE.

WE TRIED TO CONTACT THE GENERAL AT THE HOSPITAL IN HEIDELBERG WHERE HE IS... OR IS SUPPOSED TO BE. - IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE. - IMPOSSIBLE? WHY? THE HOSPITAL IS UNDER HEAVY S.S. GUARDS. NO ONE IS ALLOWED TO ENTER WITHOUT SPECIAL PERMISSION. YOU MEAN TO IMPLY THE WHOLE STORY MAY BE A FAKE? WE HAVE OFTEN ENCOUNTERED WORSE FAKES THAN THIS. WELL, WHAT DO YOU PROPOSE TO DO? WHAT ABOUT YOURSELF AND ALL THE OTHER OFFICERS? YOU PLAN TO CARRY OUT THE AGREEMENT? I AM AFRAID WITHOUT THE GENERAL WE HAVE NO POWER OVER THE TROOPS. IT'S TOO MUCH OF A RISK. A GREAT MANY LIVES ARE AT STAKE, GERMANS AS WELL AS AMERICANS. ISN'T IT WORTH TAKING THE RISK? I'M SORRY, BUT I CAN'T. AND I'M SURE THE OTHERS FEEL AS I DO. THE LIVES OF OUR FAMILIES AND OUR FRIENDS ARE INVOLVED. BESIDES, NOW IT'S ALL TOO LATE. WE SHOULD HAVE ACTED A LONG TIME AGO. YEAH, BUT THEN IT WAS TOO EARLY. YOU ALWAYS WANTED TO GET RID OF THEM, BUT WERE NEVER WILLING TO TAKE A CHANCE OR RESPONSIBILITY. WHY? BECAUSE YOU WANTED TO HANG ON TO YOUR RANKS, YOUR TITLES, YOUR JOBS. AND TODAY, WHEN YOU COULD STILL SAVE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING OF ALL-- YOUR SOULS-- YOU HAVEN'T GOT THE GUTS TO DO IT. THEY'RE RIGHT TO CALL YOU TRAITORS, BECAUSE YOU'VE BETRAYED YOURSELVES. THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY I CAN ANSWER YOU, LIEUTENANT. IT'S ALL VERY EASY FOR YOU TO SAY, BUT YOU WERE NEVER IN OUR SHOES. THAT'S TRUE. AND I HOPE WE NEVER WILL BE. OKAY. [ Explosion In Distance ] [ Tank Passing ] WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO, LIEUTENANT? GET OUT OF HERE FAST, BEFORE ONE OF THE GENTLEMEN STARTS TO TALK. [ Explosion In Distance ] - I GUESS IT'S ALL RIGHT. NOBODY FOLLOWED HIM. WAS THE SURRENDER PLANNED FOR THIS SECTOR, LIEUTENANT? YEAH. WHY? I SPENT LAST NIGHT AT THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE 11th PANZER CORPS. TWO OF THEIR REGIMENTS MOVED INTO POSITION THIS MORNING-- HERE... ON BOTH FLANKS OF GENERAL JAEGER'S TROOPS. LOOKS LIKE WE'RE WALKIN' RIGHT INTO A TRAP. WE GOTTA GET BACK, TIGER, AS QUICK AS WE CAN. BUT HOW CAN WE MAKE IT, SIR? YOU HEARD HIM. HE NEARLY GOT CAUGHT HIMSELF. [ Loud Explosions ] [ Glass Breaks ] IT MUST BE THE RHINE BRIDGE. [ Dirt Showering ] I SAW THEM PLACING THE CHARGES. - THERE GOES OUR LAST CHANCE. - IS THERE ANY OTHER WAY TO GET ACROSS? - SURE, IF YOU WANT TO SWIM. ALL RIGHT. WHAT'S THE BEST PLACE TO TRY IT? SWIM? YOU'RE NOT SERIOUS. EVERY INCH OF THE SHORE IS FORTIFIED. EVEN IF YOU GET PAST ZEMENT-- PAST YOUR OWN ARTILLERY FIRE-- WE'D FREEZE IN THE ICY WATER. WELL, WE CAN TRY. ONE OF US IS SURE TO GET THROUGH. WELL, IF YOU'RE SO BRAVE, WHY DIDN'T YOU DO IT BEFORE? BESIDES, HOW DO WE KNOW HE DIDN'T MAKE THE WHOLE THING UP? HOW DO WE KNOW HE'S TELLING THE TRUTH? MAYBE HE'S JUST TRYING-- SHUT UP. GET THE EXTRA TRAVEL ORDERS OUT AND THE DATE STAMP. NOW GO AHEAD, HAPPY. I WANT YOU TO BRIEF US ON EVERY PLACE YOU'VE BEEN, EVERYTHING YOU'VE SEEN.

WE'LL WAIT FOR HER. GO AHEAD. - YOU'RE UNCLE RUDOLPH, AREN'T YOU? - THAT'S RIGHT. MY MOTHER SAID SHE'D BE BACK IN AN HOUR. BUT IF YOU CAN'T WAIT, IT'S ALL RIGHT TO GO TO GOTTFRIED'S HOUSE. THANKS, KURT. IF YOU ARE SOLDIERS, WHY AREN'T YOU AT THE FRONT? WE JUST CAME FROM THERE, JUNGE. WE'RE ON LEAVE. WHY DOESN'T MY FATHER GET LEAVE? HE HASN'T BEEN HOME FOR A YEAR. - WE WILL TALK ABOUT THAT LATER. RIGHT NOW I WANT YOU TO WAIT IN THERE UNTIL YOUR MOTHER COMES BACK. THIS WAY. WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT GOTTFRIED? HE'S A FRIEND OF MINE. LIVES ABOUT A MILE FROM HERE. I MADE ARRANGEMENTS WITH HIM IN CASE WE NEED A PLACE TO STAY OVER. I THOUGHT WE CAME HERE TO DECIDE ON THE BEST SPOT TO CROSS THE RIVER. - I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND. I AM NOT GOING. - WHAT? SURE. IT'S ALL RIGHT FOR YOU TO TAKE THAT KIND OF A CHANCE. BUT ME AND HIM? WHEN IT'S ALL OVER, OUR OWN PEOPLE WILL SPIT IN OUR FACES. AND YOU? YOU WILL SAY THANK YOU AND FLY HOME. THEN WHY DID YOU TAKE THIS JOB? WHY DID YOU JOIN THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE? BECAUSE I WANTED TO LIVE A LITTLE BETTER, NOT TO GET KILLED. AND IF YOU WILL BE HONEST WITH YOURSELF, YOU DID IT FOR THE SAME REASON. I DID IT BECAUSE I WANTED TO HELP MY COUNTRY. - AH. - AND NOW, MORE THAN EVER, I'M SURE THAT WHAT I DID WAS RIGHT. WELL, ISN'T IT NOBLE OF HIM? WHO ARE YOU FOOLING? DO YOU THINK ANYBODY WILL BELIEVE YOU? [ Happy ] IT DOESN'T MATTER. I DON'T EXPECT THEM TO. BESIDES, IT ISN'T IMPORTANT. - THE IMPORTANT THING IS WHAT WE BELIEVE IN. - KNOCK IT OFF, BOTH OF YA. I DON'T CARE WHY YOU DID IT. YOU'RE IN THIS NOW, AND NEITHER OF YOU IS BACKING OUT. YOU BETTER GET THAT THROUGH YOUR HEAD, TIGER. YOU KNOW TOO MUCH TO BE LEFT BEHIND. I DIDN'T MEAN IT THAT WAY. [ Door Slams ] HE MUST HAVE HEARD EVERYTHING, THE LITTLE BRAT. YOU LOOK DOWNSTAIRS.
