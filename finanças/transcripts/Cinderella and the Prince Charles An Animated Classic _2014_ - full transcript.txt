My queen, you look ravishing as usual. I'm flattered, Zaral. I'm sorry to come without an appointment, but I'd like a word about your son. Prince Charles has become a very fine swordsman, but as far as his other subjects are concerned he shows very little interest. Yes, indeed, his tutor has brought the matter to our attention countless times. We've been looking for ways to make him more responsible. Well, I wouldn't worry about it too much, majesty. The Prince is quite an intelligent young man, as everyone knows. I think the reason behind his lack of interest may lie elsewhere. If you have any idea as to how we can make him a more studious student, please tell us. Perhaps he needs motivation? A nice young lady who'd be willing to marry him and settle down. You mean find him a fiancé? Yes, it would be the best way to make Charles understand that as the heir to the throne he has great responsibilities. I think you might be right. I was 17 when I took the throne, and Charles has turned 16 this year. My point exactly. I think we should act right away. -Zaral? -Yes, majesty? I want you to start rounding up candidates for Prince Charles, but be discreet. Yes, of course. Your wish is my command, majesty. At all times, the King must act with authority and nobility. Above all, he must remain impartial. There are many times when the King must make, um-- must make very quick decisions and it is very important that his judgment be based on his knowledge of the state-- I challenge you to a duel! Charles, not now. Oh, gentlemen, please settle down. Such behavior is not worthy of a future King. When your father was your age he was much more serious. As a matter of fact, he would often come to my study late at night and ask me questions about history, geography, grammar, mathematics. He was a brilliant student. Now where did they disappear to this time? Alex, I need your help. Again? But this is the second time this week you've run off. Don't argue, just help me. No one can know I've gone into town. Well, at least let me come with you, Charles. Someone might recognize you and try to hold you for ransom. Be reasonable. No one will recognize me. I'm sure. I'll see ya later. If the King ever hears about this we are in serious trouble. Cinderella! What could be taking her so long? We should have left by now. Mother, I want you to buy me a dress that makes me look older. Something like the ladies at the Royal Court would wear. And I want a new dress too! With lots and lots of lace and satin with big bows and pearls! I really need one. And I need a fancy hat with feathers. A new necklace and lovely shoes. And I want a hat to match my dress exactly! Fine, fine, I'll buy you girls anything your hearts desire just as long as you stop screeching. Where's Cinderella? She's going to make us late. If we wait too long all of the shops will be closed.

Yes, I'm his page and he's my best friend, that's why I live at the castle. Really, tell me something about him. Is he as meticulous as they say? You mean that story about him only wearing shoes once? What? Actually if there's a pair of shoes he likes, he wears them until they fall apart. I don't believe you. You're fibbing again. I'm telling you the truth. He's just an ordinary boy. When we go walking in the woods we come back covered with mud. And his favorite sport is sword fighting, ha! I don't believe you.

That's all the information I have. It's just a rumor, you know? Then am I to understand that nothing's official yet? -Yes, that is correct. -Excellent. None of it may even be true at all. What other news do you have? Apparently there's a thief who's been sneaking into the royal vineyard and stealing grapes right under the King's nose! It's ridiculous.

Oh, I know, and he's a very good watchman, too. Huh? He chased me all over that vineyard. (laughs) But I'm too fast for him. Wait until someone finds out that the thief actually lives in the castle.

Madam, young ladies, I'm here to tell you that we managed to catch the real thief after all and so Miss Cinderella, I offer you my most humble apologies. Apology accepted, but can you tell me something? Yes. Who was it? Who was the real thief stealing the royal grapes? Well, he promised never to do it again so we just sent him home with a royal warning. Oh, really, you did? Oh, uh, yes. I drove him myself.

But Charles... ♪ Majesties, the Prince seems to have fallen in love with my daughter. Hm, I don't know. I didn't get the feeling that he was that interested. On the contrary, I would say he's trying to hide his feelings. He's young and still shy. If he seems standoffish it's because he's falling in love with her. It's typical behavior for his age. We should introduce him to other young ladies. Allow me to disagree, majesty. Don't forget that one day the Prince will become King. It should be obvious that he mustn't be allowed to marry just any young lady. He must make the right choice. If we are not careful we could find him wanting to marry an unsuitable young lady who's only interested in becoming queen, and that would be a pity. I'm in complete agreement. You know, your majesty, about my daughter-- ah, but please, don't think that I'm here to suggest the position for Isabelle, however it's my duty to think about the future of the kingdom, so I would like to organize a party at my home in a few days in order to celebrate my daughter's birthday.

Cinderella, have you finished working on my hat? Of course it's ready. I've re-sewn the feathers. Yes, I can see you have. (yells) Change the decoration. I want flowers on it too. But Catherine, you're the one who told me to put the feathers on. You didn't mention flowers. What are you babbling about? You don't understand a thing, Cinderella! No lady in her right mind would be seen wearing a hat with feathers at this time of year! I see. Well-- So remove some feathers and add some flowers! The Duke's party will be held tomorrow. I want my hat to be the most stylish. She's so selfish. Hm, it's disgusting. And unfair. Hm, I'd love to make her eat that hat! ♪ Father, do you think that Prince Charles will come to the reception? But of course. He can't refuse to be present at a party in honor of the young lady he's going to marry. Oh, do you really think he'll marry me? Excuse me, Your Lordship. I've checked the replies. All the young ladies from the aristocracy have accepted the invitation. That's great news. I need this party to be a success. If all of the young ladies attend, the Prince can compare us and he'll see I'm the most beautiful! Oh, I must go choose my dress. See you later. Yes, go on. Thompson, you still haven't told me the Prince's response. Will he attend? Uh, well, your lordship, we still don't know. He--he doesn't want to say. Nincompoops!

Tomorrow will be an ideal day for hunting. How about going off together for a few days? You're not serious? Have you forgotten that tomorrow is Isabelle's birthday party? No, but I still haven't accepted the invitation. I really don't feel like going. Oh, yeah, well, why not? I don't feel like it. I don't know what to do. This hat's lovely. Yes, but mine is much nicer. Mother, I have a question. What kind of person is this Isabelle, whose birthday party we're going to? That's really of no importance. She's a stranger to me too. The only thing that matters to us is that you'll get to know the Prince better. Mother, you mean that the Prince will attend the party? Obviously, but I can't imagine why that would interest you, my dear Cinderella. Oh. Hm. I wonder if it wouldn't have been better to keep those flowers after all. Oh, I don't know. It is the latest style. Yes, but that's just it. If all the other girls are in the latest style they'll be wearing a feathered hat. What chance do I have of being noticed by the Prince? Why don't you simply ask Cinderella to change the decoration for you? She's had enough practice by now. She should be quick. These feathers are definitely wrong. There are dozens of girls wearing feathers like these. If I only knew how the other girls would be dressed today! We don't have much time left. Stop worrying about petty details. We have to leave. No, hold on. I must think. I've just had an excellent idea. Cinderella, would you like to come to the party with us? Huh, how come? I thought that you could come with us up to Isabelle's house. Catherine, what are you saying? Mother, Cinderella could join us. It would certainly make her very happy. So, do you wish to come? Oh, just give me a minute so I can change my dress!

Huh, why wouldn't I be able to, Jeanne? Say you fell in love with a boy but you were forbidden to see him. What would you do? Oh, let's see.
