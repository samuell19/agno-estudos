[light dramatic music] [garage door clanking] [dramatic music] -[drill whirring] -[motorbike engine rumbling] -[motorbike roaring] -[crowd cheering] [motorbike rumbling] [tires screeching] [motorbike rumbling] [bike thudding] [Jake groaning] [rattling] This magnificent castle is now officially a crime scene. 50 extremely rare and highly valuable diamonds that have been in the Hurst family for generations have been stolen from this high security tower right here behind me. Police are appealing for any information that could lead towards the arrest of these criminals or criminal involved in this despicable crime. [TV clicking] Lady Hurst was unavailable for comment, but those close to her say that she is devastated by the loss of these gems that were handed down to her as a child by her late mother. -[thudding] -[light dramatic music] -[birds chirping] -[wheels clicking] [Jake groaning] -[whooshing] -[leaves crunching] -Are your arms broken? -No. Are your legs broken? No. Are you alive? Yes. [chuckling] Then let's go. [Sam] Somehow Daddy was always there to pick us up and dust us off. It wasn't always like this. -Let me give you some context. -[bright music] It was that summer when the green turned to golden brown. [bike wheels clicking] We actually live in Glen Close. It's the same name as some American movie actress, apparently quite talented. We've won the lottery of life, Dad says. He says there are people starving, no water in the tap, let alone England's greenest hills and beautiful views. There's a saying, "You've don't know what you've got till it's gone." Well, I was soon going to understand what that meant. You don't know me yet, but my name is Sam. [bright music] -[ball thudding] -This is my brother, Jake. Cute, they all say. These guys are the reasons our parents invented neighborhood watch, dodgy. This guy, I've got a four letter word for him. Actually, it's five letters. I was never that good at spelling. We'll come back to them. You yell if you see them around. This is my mom, that's my school. My mom is the sensible one. That's a good quality for a mommy. Daddy, however, is a bit different. He's a speedway racer. Mommy thinks he should stop, but he loves it too much. You know, these speedway bikes don't even have brakes. The only breaks are your bones, Mom says. [motorbike engines revving] [motorbikes roaring] [crowd cheering] He used to be a champ, but that was long before we came along. It's been so long since he's won, his trophies are gathering dust. Something happened with Mommy and Daddy. I don't know what exactly, but grownups are funny. [clippers clicking] Everything is a military operation to him. He even cuts the hedge like he's on a mission. He has a machine in the garage, but he insists on using these big green scissors. He treats everything as exercise and a test of precision. [Michael sighing] He's got this crazy American car. -[water hissing] -He loves that car. Mom says he loves it more than her. Dad seems obsessed with America. He met Mom there and they drove around America in this big old car. Apparently, I was made in the back seat or something, but I really don't want to talk about that. Apparently it's the exact car that was used in some American movie, staring Clive Eastman or something, but I can't quite remember its name. It's Clint, Clint Eastwood, and he's the finest movie star who ever lived. And because of his movies, he'll always live. [soft music] [Sam] It's so precious, he won't even drive it. He's a bit of a joker. He used to set traps with string and stuff like that. [dramatic musical sting] [toy squeaking] -Seriously? -Hmm. [chuckling] [Sam] One Halloween, he pulled this gag. [Jake] Why don't we go to the park? [Jake screaming] [Michael growling] Oh, Jake, I'm sorry. [Jake crying] It's just a silly mask, okay? -Just a silly mask. -[Jake crying] I'm so sorry. [Sam] Jake cried for hours. That morning before it all happened, a bird circled the house. I should have known it was a sign. Apparently these signs are everywhere, if only we knew where to look. So, Mom's off back to America. Oh, bye, boys. [light dramatic music] -You be good for Daddy, okay? -[Sam] Okay. [Sam] This is the moment Daddy should have stopped Mommy leaving, but he didn't. I love you guys. -Come on. -[Sam] They think we don't notice the looks they give each other behind our backs, but we do. I've become something of a lip reading expert. A skill I had no ambition to acquire, but it was going to prove more of a lifesaver than I ever could have imagined. So, it's Dad's big race in less than a week. Mom normally does all the kid stuff, so she thinks leaving us with him will stop Dad practicing for his race. But I don't think she knows that man as well as she thinks. [commentator] Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon and welcome to Arlington Stadium. An afternoon of fun, thrills and speedway. [crowd cheering and applauding] But of course, we have to welcome our resident champion, the one and only Kevin Jenkins! -[Kevin screaming] -[crowd cheering] [Sam] Everyone loved this new champ, but I think he loved himself just a little too much. [woman] Come on. Come on! [dramatic music] [motorbike rumbling] [motorbike revving] [motorbike roaring] [dramatic music] [crowd cheering] [Sam] And as usual, he won again. [crowd cheering] Dad says it's just about the taking part. [light dramatic music] But I could see something was breaking his heart. [dramatic music] Shouldn't you be at home changing diapers or whatever it is daddies do? I came second, didn't I? You think second is winning, huh? What is your problem? It's a young man's game. -[Kevin spitting] -[light dramatic music] Go and do something important, Daddy. [Sam] My dad used to have sponsors. There was interviews on TV and everything, but guess who gets all that now? [Michael] Look at all of these landscapes, and America is so huge, you know, England would fit into one of these states and there are 50 of them. Can you imagine the biking we could do? You know that man at the stadium? Yeah. Why was he being mean to you? Ah, don't worry about him. Some people are just like that. Why didn't you do anything? Like what, hit him? Mm. You can't just go around hitting people. Violence is almost never the answer, unless we're talking about an absolute bully. Are you allowed to hit a bully? Well, not officially. I mean... don't tell your mom I ever said this, definitely don't tell any teachers, but if there's a really nasty piece of work and you've tried everything else, there's really only one way to stop them. But you have to do it right. Tell us. Right there, straight on those nose with everything you've got. It doesn't matter how big you are, a whack to the nose and you're down. But I didn't tell you that. [soft music] Goodnight, boys. [boat horn blowing] -[car honking] -[Michael on phone] Come on, it's the finals, Lucy, you know that. [Lucy] But it's so dangerous. [Michael sighing] I miss you. [Michael] Same here, okay? I miss you, too, but I need to race on Saturday. It's what I've been building up to. Besides, it's good for the boys to see some healthy competition. [scoffing] Healthy? It's noisy and it stinks! [scoffing] Michael, you put your life on the line every time you get on that thing. I hate to break it to you, but you're not 25 anymore. I know. You're a father, you need to start acting responsibly. How would those boys feel if the last thing they saw of you was a pile of dust? [soft music] [Michael] What else do I do, Lucy? What else am I good at? I'm not even sure how good I am at that anymore. -I-- -Sam's up, I've got to go. -[Lucy] Okay. -Okay, bye. -[upbeat music] -[Sam] We were still getting out and about on our bikes. [leaves rustling] Until one day we discovered something much better. Something new, something safer, something easy to control. We wouldn't even need Mom and Dad to pick us up -or dust us off. -[tires skidding] [stairs creaking] -[muffled video game] -[TV playing] What are you doing? Playing tennis. And what are you doing? Playing football. No, you're not, your arms are not swinging, your legs are not moving. Let's go outside, play some ball. [Sam shushing] [Michael sighing] [fists thudding] [bag rattling] Are you angry? Look, I can play a boxing game and it's fun, but there's nothing like actually punching that bag. The feeling in your lungs, the exertion. Look, Sam, those devices, they're amazing. They've changed the world forever, the people that have made them are geniuses, but those geniuses did not expect the children of today to be sat there all day staring into them. Listen to me, you can play 1,000 motorbike games with your fingers, but you'll never get the same feeling as when you get on that bike, you feel that engine roar, that air is your lungs, dirt in your face. That is adventure. It's exercise. And when I'm gone, I do not want you boys just sat staring into those screens for the rest of your life. [light dramatic music] Come here. You want to punch the bag? Mm-hmm. All right, punch the bag. -[thudding] -[Sam groaning] Okay, you want to punch really hard? You don't punch the bag. Look at me, you punch through the bag. [light dramatic music] [Sam] We didn't realize at that moment, what we were about to learn would soon be used in a life or death situation. [fist thudding] That's it, come on. Let's get this going. Okay, boys, what is this? A ball. It's not a ball, it's a device to train your accuracy. If you can catch a ball at high speed, you can anticipate a turn, a bump, you can react at lightning speed. Jake, you're up. [bright music] [Michael huffing] [Jake grunting] [ball thudding] Yes! -Yes! -[upbeat music] [Sam] Then the real training began. [fist thudding] [fist thudding] [fist thudding] -[upbeat music] -[fist thudding] [ball thudding] -[Sam sighing] -So, what do you want to eat? -Sweets. -Chocolate. [sighing] Come with me. [Sam] To Dad, this was his worst nightmare. One day we might not do anything for real. In his eyes, something drastic had to be done. Look at all this, this is energy food. Look at all the colors. Nature has made all these amazing things for us. Here, do you know how many trees you can climb on one of these? -[Sam] How many? -I don't know exactly, but a lot more than you can on sweets and chocolate, okay? Okay, boys, what is this? -A piece of paper. -Wrong again. Everything is what you make it. This is good exercise, this is running in fields, this is air in your lungs, but you have to make it so. You just never know where a little piece of paper can take you. [soft music] [air whooshing] [bright music] -[air whooshing] -[Sam] At first, it was just me, then my best friend, then three, then the whole class. Even the girls joined in. [air whooshing] And then, there she was. [soft piano music] I should've said something. But I wasn't brave enough. Not yet. And when Christopher Columbus was sailing those seven seas, he experienced things that others could only dream about. Your next topic, I want you all to think wisely about Columbus. How was he feeling when just he had discovered such a magnificent and beautiful sight? [soft music] And Master Samuel Harris, if you spent just a little more time looking at your school book than you do at Amelie, you might just pass with flying colors. [students laughing] [students talking] [children laughing] [Sam] Uh... uh... um. [suspenseful music] Everything is what you make it. You have to make it so. Uh, do you want to come to the races on Saturday? [boy] No! -Okay. -[students giggling] -[upbeat music] -[Sam] Of course, I did that in private. [motorbikes roaring] [suspenseful music] [Sam] Somehow, my heart was beating faster than ever at Dad's after school practice. [motorbikes roaring] [phone ringing] -[both] Hello, Mommy. -[Lucy giggling] Hey, boys. -[Sam] Hello, Mommy. -How are you? [Sam] We've been flying paper airplanes-- [Jake] We've been going on bike rides in the fields. We've been flying through the air. -Daddy through the ball and... -I-- I-- -...I caught it, and then we... -Paper airplanes. Went to the field and I did epic jumps. We went over the ramp with the scooter-- -[Sam] We did BMXing through-- -[Jake] We climbed the frame -loads of times. -Uh, huh. -And it was really fun. -Uh, huh. [Lucy giggling] -And also, this girl, Amelie. -Uh, huh. I asked her out to Daddy's race on Saturday. Oh, yeah? Hmm. [bright music] Mommy misses you. [both] We miss you too, Mommy. [Lucy laughing] [Sam] We're going on a bike ride now. -[Jake] Bye, Mommy. -Going to go on a bike ride now. -Bye, Mom. -I love you, boys. Love you too, Mom. You be careful. -Bye, Mom. -[phone clicking] [light dramatic music] [bright music] [Sam] Bye, Daddy, we're off to practice. [Michael] Oh, well, bye, boys. [Jake] Bye, Daddy. [Michael] Be careful. [light dramatic music] [wind whistling] [wheels skidding] [crow cawing] [light dramatic music] [sheep baaing] "Beyond the dark windmill, two swallows hold the key." Let's just leave it, it's not meant for us. Wait, the dark windmill, that's the other side of the downs. Yeah, but that's miles away. Come on, let's investigate it. [upbeat music] [birds chirping] [light dramatic music] [Sam] Two swallows hold the key. [eerie music] Look, over there! "B13, midnight sparkles." B for books? B for bad idea. Come on, let's go back. Wait. B13, B13, there are 14 bunkers or Kneecap Hill. Remember, we went on a walk there with Mom and Dad. That's miles away. It's going to be getting dark soon. Remember, Dad said we should be having adventures. Look, we've got a key, let's at least investigate. [soft music] [light dramatic music] [bikes clicking] [birds chirping] [Sam] There's 12. There, 13 this must be it. [Jake] Look, there's something inside. [Sam] Oh, yeah, what is that? [light dramatic music] [door clicking] [dramatic music] -Come on, boys. -[crickets chirping] [door slamming] -[wings flapping] -[crow cawing] [lock clicking] [suspenseful music] [finger tapping] [box clicking] No! That can't be right. It's hours until midnight. -[box creaking] -[both gasping] -There's someone in there. -You what? [Jake] Wow, diamonds. Do you think they're real? Well, how about we find out? Are you sure? -[box clicking] -[dramatic music] -Movement. -I don't know. [dramatic music] [Simpson groaning] -Oi! -[dramatic musical sting] [Simpson] Oi! [Sam panting] [Reynolds] Come on. Gee! [panting] [Simpson] What the-- -[boys panting] -[men panting] -It's empty. -No. -[thudding] -[skidding] That's not possible. Not without the key. How have they got the key? [Simpson sighing] -[Jake panting] -Are you okay? -Just, go get them! -[dramatic music] [Sam] Quick, they're coming. [Simpson panting] [leaves rustling] [Reynolds] Ah, where they gone? [Simpson] Hang on. -Catch. -[Reynolds chuckling] [light dramatic music] [helmet thudding] -Right. -[Simpson] Go, go, go. -[Reynolds panting] -Eh? [leaves rustling] -That way. -There. [dramatic music] [Sam whispering] Quick, now go. [dramatic music] [Sam panting] [Simpson] What? Hey. [Reynolds] There he is, come here. [Simpson] Run, Reynolds, run! -[bike thudding] -All right, come here. [Sam] Quick, come on, come on. Power it, power it! [dramatic music] -Come here! -[Simpson] Get the other one, get the other one. [Sam panting] [Reynolds panting] [Reynolds] Freeze! [Sam panting] [Simpson] Come on! [Reynolds] They're getting away. [Sam panting] [Reynolds panting] [Simpson panting] [both panting] [dramatic music] Down here. [both panting] Right. [light dramatic music] [tires skidding] We've lost them. [both panting] [Sam] Hello, Daddy. -Hello, Daddy. -[Michael] Hey, boys, wait a second. Boys, I was worried about you. You've been ages. Are you okay? I was thinking, you know, if you want to have a go at the goggle-pad, it's okay with me. Maybe like, uh, ten minute slots or something? Boss is going to kill us. How did they find them? Maybe the note that blew away? What? I was halfway through writing the note for the exchange, and I wanted to be outside, you know, around the bloom. Flowers are amazing at this time of year. I didn't want to miss out. And the wind picked up and blew it away. I tried to grab it, but it was gone. I thought it got stuck in a bush somewhere, so... I wrote another. -Great. -[Simpson sighing] [light dramatic music] [diamonds rattling] You're meant to be the fastest, you couldn't even grab them. Well, it wasn't my idea to hide the diamonds in the first place, was it? Well, if it wasn't for me, we wouldn't have even spotted the kids. [Reynolds] You were the one that lost that note. That note was a stupid idea. [Simpson] Do you know, I never wanted to be a criminal anyway. I wanted to be a gardener. I wanted to have a plot of land, some tulips and some grass. Yeah, but my mom said, "You haven't got green fingers. You've got sticky fingers." -[hand thudding] -Shut... up. [Sam] Look at these things, they could be worth a fortune. What do you think we should do with the money? Right now those two little boys are making fools of both of you. Buy a helicopter. Or even better, a private jet. [Vladislav sighing] We could help the poor people Daddy tells us about. [Vladislav chuckling] With your share of the profit, hmm? you could buy a patch of land that you could tend for the remainder of your living days. What do you think Mommy and Daddy would want? A trip to America, no doubt about it. But without it, the only digging will be that of two shallow graves. One the size of your body. And one half the size of your body. [eerie music] -Just half? -Oh, yes. Because the other half will be stuffed and mounted above my desk as a warning to others that mistakes will not be tolerated. [suspenseful music] Should we tell Daddy? No, let's just keep it a surprise. Do I make myself clear? Yeah, completely. I mean, especially the bit about the... the other half body thing. Just go! Let's find out what they're worth first. Bring me my diamonds. Or... those two boys. [objects clattering] [Vladislav sighing] -[tires screeching] -[bright music] Look, jewelry. Surely, he'll know how much it's worth. -Ask him. -No, you ask him. -No, you ask him. -No, you ask him. -No, you ask. -No, you ask-- Can I help you? Oh, uh, yes, we have something to show you. We want to know how much it's worth. [bright music] [light dramatic music] [suspenseful music] It's worthless, I'm afraid. Junk. You boys are after a bit of pocket money, aren't you? Well, I'll take it off your hands for a tenner. Ten whole pound you didn't have before you came in here. No, thank you. -Okay, 50, 100? -[bright music] 1,000? Oh. You're a good negotiator. There they are. That's, that's the antique shop. [Sam] Yes! -Come on, they must've sold them. -They, they've sold them? [light dramatic music] [door slamming] Boo! [bike wheels clicking] [light dramatic music] Look, it's as I've told you. They only had one and they took it away! [muffled shouting] [bike wheels clicking] [light dramatic music] Those men, they must be criminals. What if they come here? [toy squeaking] Don't worry about them, I got a plan. [bright music] [branch snapping] [light dramatic music] [suspenseful music] What the hell are you doing? These are begonias, they're meant to be in bloom, -but look at them. -There's half a million pounds of our diamonds in there, and all you're worried about is the blooming. I'm just saying, anyone prepared to let begonias get in a state like this. I'm just trying to figure out what kind of people we're dealing with. Dealing with? When the boss finds out that two snotty-nosed little kids made off with our diamonds, -you'll know what we're dealing with. -[chuckling] don't be fooled. I need to relax. Kick back. [muffled shouting] [Vladislav sighing] [store owner groans] [Simpson] In the 1920's, kids went up chimneys, down coal mines, their blackened faces risking more life than limb, than any adult ever could. They work for big powerful businessmen. On a BMX? Just saying, kids work for drug cartels on, on, on roller skates! [light dramatic music] Just be careful, that's all. Just tread carefully, there's a light on. [light dramatic music] [Michael] You boys had me worried. Are you sure there's nothing you need to tell me? [Reynolds shushing] -[light clicks] -[Simpson] Security light! Oh, ah! [Simpson hushing] [Michael] Thought I heard something. [Simpson] That's quite a nice bush, actually. -[suspenseful music] -Goodnight, Jake. [branch cracking] -[plank thudding] -[Simpson groaning] -What's-- -What the-- [Simpson groaning] [flesh slicing] -It's rigged. -[Simpson groaning] Let's get in there. [Simpson huffing] [light dramatic music] [Michael] Dogs probably. Sweet dreams then, Jake. Right, right, right, if you remove just one panel of glass, get to the door handle, then we're in. Here, borrow my gardening gloves. -Go on. -Pink? [light suspenseful music] -[water rushing] -[toothbrush scraping] [Simpson] Okay. [shushing] -All right. -[wood snapping] [glass clicking] [Reynolds chuckling] [Simpson] Right. [door lock clicking] -[water rushing] -[toothbrush scraping] [light licking] [suspenseful music] [bright music] [Reynolds chuckling] [suspenseful music] -[thudding] -[Reynolds groaning] [Reynolds whimpering] -[water rushing] -[toothbrush scraping] [Reynolds whimpering] [garage door rattling] [Reynolds groaning] All right, I'm going to smash my way in. [Simpson] Oh, my God. -It's Mike Harris. -What? The speedway rider, look! This must be his house. Oh, my God. I was at the Euro Championships '94. He was three bikes back, then on the last lap, he canes it up on the inside, front wheel almost doesn't touch the ground. Boom, right on the line, he takes from Henshall. It was just beautiful. [chuckling] I bet that trophy is here somewhere-- -Right, that's it. -No, no, no, no, wait. This is perfect. Harris hasn't won for a while. All these new kids, younger, faster, I bet he hasn't won any prize money for yonks. I hear his sponsor pulled out and backed some other kid. What are you talking about? No one knows who took those diamonds. If the police think he did, and it makes perfect sense, he would need another source of income. So... I'll make an anonymous call to the police, tell them that I know for a fact that Mike Harris has the diamonds and he has them right there in his very house. They'll go there, find the diamonds for us, the diamonds, they'll end up in the evidence room for what? Two, three days before they've done the paperwork, and then they'll return them. How do you know that? Because my mom works down at that police station. Your mom works for the police? As a cleaner. She's cool and she's very supportive. And the other thing is, she can get into that evidence room on her cleaning duties, which happens to be tomorrow night. She can slip the diamonds back to us, and from then on, we're in the clear. Meanwhile, Mike Harris will be speeding his way to a life behind bars. What do you say, guys? [Vladislav slurping] -I like it. -[Simpson sighing] But on one condition. If we try this and it doesn't work, it'll be the last thing you ever do, ever. Hmm? Yes, sir. -[light dramatic music] -[Simpson chuckling] -Yeah. -Goody, goody, gumdrops. Let's do it. [Vladislav slurping] [coffee splashing] [light dramatic music] -[Michael] Jake. -[Jake] Thank you. [Michael] Sam. -Enjoy. -[Sam] Thank you, Daddy. [Michael] My pleasure. Boys, have you been messing around down here? There's a brick on a piece of string. -Do you think that-- -Who do you think it was? -[car door slamming] -[muffled police radio chatter] [dispatcher] Negative, sir, there's a car parked in the drive. -Daddy. -Yeah? [Sam] There's something that we need to tell you. -Right. -[door knocking] -Um. -Tell me in a minute. -I'll just go and get the door. -[knocking] -[door clicking] -[muffled radio chatter] -[Sam whispering] Do you think it's about the diamonds? -No. Can I help you? Mr. Michael Harris? Detective Inspector Peter Hector. That's a lovely motor you've got there. Bit of a diamond, wouldn't you say? If this is about that number plate, it never goes off the end of that drive. It's not about the number plate, is it? -[dramatic music] -Mr. Michael Harris, we are entering your premises in accordance with section 32 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984-- Wait, wait, what is this about? -Just stay calm. -I am calm, -but this is ridiculous. -[inspector] Is it now? [whispering] It must be to do with the diamonds. [whispering] Shall we tell them? -Where's the boys' mother? -She's back home in America. Is she now? -Who do you think-- -What should we do? [woman] Sir, I found them. That's, that's not mine. Precisely. Mr. Michael Harris, I am arresting you on suspicion of the theft of half a million pounds worth of diamonds-- -Boys, I didn't do anything. -You do not need to say anything, -but it may harm your-- -[Michael] This is ridiculous. -I've done nothing wrong. Boys. -You do not have to say anything, -but it harm your defense... -[officer] Ah, ah, ah. ...when questioned, something you later rely on... [light dramatic music] -Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. -No! [grunting] -He didn't do anything. -[officer] Calm down. -We found them. -Calm down. -But, but-- -He'll be fine. We'll look after him, okay? Boys, I know this is upsetting, but this is the law, and the law is there to protect you and us. [Sam] But, but he didn't do anything. He didn't, we found-- But-- Now, listen to me, your mommy's going to be contacted, but until she returns, you need to come with us. It's a really nice facility, boys, with very caring professionals. You'll be well looked after, you just need to come with us. [light dramatic music] [Jake sighing] But we need our teddies, otherwise we'll be very sad. Okay then, let's go get the teddies. [upbeat music] -[Sam] Jake, run! -[officer] No, you don't, come here. Come here, you two. [officer] Oh, come on. Stop, stop. Jake, out the window! -[officers panting] -Where are they? [officer] Oh. oh, my God, the window. I can't see them, they must have jumped. We're going to have to radio this in. -[dramatic music] -Hey, stop, you two! Come here! Stop! Where do you think you're going? [chair thudding] Hey, hey, where are you going? -Hey, stop, stop! -[window lock squeaking] [suspenseful music] [officer] Where did you-- Come back. Come here. [officer] Boys, stop! [thudding] -[bike clicking] -[officer] They're getting away! [Sam panting] [male officer] Hey, come on. Hey, oi! [female officer] Stop these boys! [tires skidding] I'll go and radio it in. [car door slamming] All units, we have our suspect under arrest, stolen diamonds in hand. [bike clicking] Two boys on the run. I repeat, two children on the run. Description, one blonde, about, well... not very high, um. -[crows cawing] -[birds chirping] [man] Don't touch me! -Don't you touch me! -Enjoy your stay with us. -We look forward to welcoming you again. -[muffled yelling] -[female officer] This way. -Next! [female officer] Right, down the stairs, come on. And who might you be? Mike, Michael Harris. Michael, lovely. Occupation? Speedway rider. Speedway rider. [chuckling] That's very good. Speedway rider. [Michael sighing] -Speedway rider. -[suspenseful music] [birds chirping] [bike wheels clicking] Fabulous, reason for arrest? Theft of half a million pounds worth of diamonds. -Disgusting. -I, I didn't. Disgusting. Is this some kind of joke? Joke? We take crime very seriously. Very seriously, indeed. I've spent 23 years with criminal after criminal, and I don't know how much more... I can take. Look, my kids are out there, God only knows where, and no one's doing a thing about it. Well, no disrespect, but maybe a little less grand theft and you might be at home playing pass the parcel and eating ice cream. -Cell number seven. -[thudding] -[Michael sighing] -Enjoy your stay. We look forward to working with you again. [light dramatic music] This is all our fault. We can make it right. Should we call Mommy? We just got Daddy arrested. Calling Mommy is not an option. [Michael sighing] We have to get Daddy out. Plus it's his race on Saturday. He'll never forgive us if he misses that. [fist thudding] [Michael sighing] I'm hungry. [Michael] Look at all this, this is energy food. Do you know how many trees you can climb on one of these? When I'm gone, I do not want you boys just sat staring into those screens for the rest of your life. Come on, I've got a plan. Come on. [officer sighing] [light suspenseful music] [tires screeching] [birds chirping] [crows cawing] [light dramatic music] [water rushing] [bottle thudding] [water splashing] [suspenseful music] [light suspenseful music] -[dramatic musical sting] -[box thudding] [door creaking] [light dramatic music] [light suspenseful music] [suspenseful music] Oi, you two, come back here! Here! Hey! All units. All units, all units to Glen Close. [officer chuckling] Glen Close, that's brilliant. I'm being serious, those two little boys have escaped again. Yeah, all, all units, all units up Meryl Street. Those kids again. [upbeat music] [sirens wailing] -Hey, Lucy, how are you? -Michael, I've been worried. -I've been calling and calling. -Yeah, sorry about that. The boys and I have just been playing and playing. You know how it is. Okay... would you put them on? I'd like to talk to them. Uh, yeah, of course, of course. Hey, boys, do you want to take a break from the tennis and talk to your mommy? -Really sorry. -Really sorry. We'll pay you back, we promise. -We promise. -We'll pay you back. -Sorry, so sorry. -Come back, come back! [Michael] No? Really? [light suspenseful music] Hey, Sam, be nice to Jake, all right? None of that stuff. Cheeky boys, you know how they are, right? Okay, as long as everything's fine. [Michael sighing] Is everything fine, Michael? Fine. Everything is great. It's all under control. Okay. See you soon, right? [light dramatic music] [Michael sighing] [gentle music] [Jake groaning] [tearing] [officer sighing] Well, if you really didn't do this, yet the diamonds were found in your house. You have to consider that the real thieves are your boys. No, no way. In my line of work, we normally find when people run, they're guilty of something. My boys are good boys. They would never do something like that. Let me show you something. [light dramatic music] [Michael sighing] So, your boys would never do something like that, eh? Quite terrified, the poor lady. Probably a small mercy we don't have the sound. [phone dialing] [light suspenseful music] [tearing] [phone ringing] [crunching] [phone ringing] [phone dialing] Come on, come on. [phone ringing] PC 383 Jackson. Uh, I'm sorry? Who is this? Lucy Harris, who the hell are you? I'm the policeman guarding your house while your husband's in jail and your kids are on the run, miss. [suspenseful music] What? [birds chirping] [phone ringing] -Hello? -[Lucy] It's Lucy Harris. Get my husband on the phone, please. Do not put me on hold. -[officer] Well, just what-- -[Lucy] I am not waiting... -No, no, no. -...any longer. Just give him the phone. [officer] All right. There's a call for you. -No. -Now, officially, you're not meant to have any more calls, -but this lady here... -No, no, no, no. ...she's phoned about 57 times, and she's not going to -let it go, so, uh. -No, just tell her -I'm not in. -Oh. [chuckling] I'm just handing the phone to your husband, madam, in his cell. [dramatic music] -[Michael] Lucy. -Michael. -What is going on? -Just-- I leave you for a week and this is what happens? Stolen diamonds, boys on the run? -You-- Where are they, Michael? -Just let me explain. [Lucy] I knew you were irresponsible, but this is off the scale-- -[security] Ma'am. -[Michael] Just-- I am on the next flight. Listen... just let me explain. I'm sorry. [phone thudding] [birds chirping] [light dramatic music] [Michael sighing] [light dramatic music] [bike thudding] [birds chirping] [low rumbling] [gentle music] [air whooshing] [children giggling] [distant yelling] [light dramatic music] [wheels skidding] -[wings flapping] -[crow cawing] [Sam] Well, I don't know if it was that weird dream or the church, but I remember something someone once said. "If you are lost and you don't know what to do... you should retrace your steps." So, that is what we're going to do. [dramatic music] [tires screeching] [Sam] Stop, wait! [light dramatic music] [key clicking] [finger tapping] [Sam] This must be where they were watching us from. -This looks like a bomb. -Jake, just put it down. [Jake grumbling] [dramatic music] [bike clicking] [tires screeching] [dramatic music] [Sam] Suddenly, those years of lip reading practice came in handy. Even with my lip reading skills, this was a tough one. I couldn't be sure, but he said something about the police station. And a cleaner mom, very odd. That was not the owner of the shop. Those criminals have done something with him. Boo! -[muffled shouting] -[Sam] I can only imagine -how terrible. -[shop owner groaning] -[slurping] -[Sam] If we're ever going to get Daddy out, it was time to do something a bit more drastic. -[light dramatic music] -[bike screeching] [phone ringing] [bike screeching] [light dramatic music] [Sam] I knew I'd seen that face before. Now this cleaner mom thing is starting to make sense. Is she in on this? [phone ringing] [cleaner humming] [sighing] Do you mind? You are meant to be a cleaner, not a masseuse. Well, I've cleaned everything else. Everything except the evidence room. [light dramatic music] I could go down and do that. I just need the key. We don't clean the evidence room. No one ever cleans the evidence room. The evidence room is a dank and dirty place full of unspeakable things from unspeakable crimes. Well, I'll just stay here then. Carry on. I've got two hours of my shift left. We'll soon have you spick and span. [cleaner humming] [drawer clicking] Bon Appétit. Merci, señor. I warn you, the smell down there is so pungent that you and your little pompom friend won't be down there very long. [light suspenseful music] [distant yelling] [female officer] I don't know what's wrong with that officer Pierce. [giggling] Perhaps he needs to get himself a girlfriend. Would you do? -Or a boyfriend. -[male officer] Yeah, move over. [female officer] I mean, and that one in cell 12, for goodness sake, -he is really-- -[phone buzzing] I got the keys, son. Wait out the back and I'll have those gems to you in no time. [cleaner cackling] All right, Mom. Yeah. Bye. [Simpson chuckling] [light dramatic music] [suspenseful music] [bag rustling] -[thudding] -[cleaner grumbling] [eerie music] [bag rustling] [eerie music] [cleaner screaming] [body thudding] What was that? What the blazes? What have you done to this poor woman? -Arrest them! -[Sam] Jake, run! [officer 1] Stop, come here, boys. Come here. [dramatic music] [officer 2] Come here then. Stop, you little. [officer 1] Stop, come here, you two! [officer 2] Stop! [officer grunting] [gate squeaking] [officer 1] Oh, my God. Stop. [dramatic musical sting] Stop, hmm? -Just-- -[boys groaning] Hang on. Just stop, all right? You don't know what's going on, do you? The cleaner's son is outside at the back door right now waiting for the diamonds! That is ridiculous. What the, what? [paper crinkling] This man, I know where he is, I can get him for you, if you give me my dad back. [Hector scoffing] Well, if you can prove he's the real thief, your dad goes free. [light suspenseful music] [bikes clicking] [tires skidding] Hello, boys. May I help you? Your boys have failed to get the diamonds. You need us, we're ready to make a deal. [Vladislav chuckling] A deal? [Vladislav laughing] I stole those diamonds, hmm? But okay. [dramatic music] It's my deal, huh? Give me the diamonds or I'll snap his neck like a... how do you say, uh, a lolly stick. That's my brother! Then you'd better be quick or I'll snap both your necks. [Michael] Violence is almost never the answer, unless we're talking about an absolute bully. You're a bully, aren't you? [Vladislav chuckling] I'm only just getting started. Right there, straight on the nose with everything you've got. [suspenseful music] [Michael] You want to punch really hard? Punch through the bag. [fist thudding] [Jake panting] [gentle music] [Sam chuckling] -[sirens wailing] -[muffled radio chatter] [Sam] Wait a second, let's rewind a bit. [tape re-winding] Detective Hector did check out my story, and guess what? [muffled police radio chatter] They got those guys. [clicking] [Sam] But then I did have to deal with a little bit of technology, but for the right reasons. [Vladislav] A deal? [chuckling] I stole those diamonds, hmm? [sirens wailing] [Sam] It turns out the police don't much like bullies either. [bright music] [Vladislav on recorder] I stole those diamonds. [Sam] All in all, I think it was a pretty good day's work for Detective Hector. But there was still one pretty major thing left to do. [airplane roaring] And we really have to do it before Mommy gets back. [tires squeaking] [Michael] Boys, God, I've missed you. I missed you, boys. I missed you so much. I really have. Just a little paperwork. Three to four hours and you'll be out of here. [Jake] You'll be in time for your race, Daddy. No, boys, I don't care about any of that now. The fact is you're safe, and that's all that matters to me. [Jake] You have to, it's who you are. It's what you love. [Sam] And Jake was right. But my race is in 30 minutes. [upbeat music] Put these on. [Jake] You can do it, Daddy. Come on. [Sam] It was like watching Daddy come alive again. [motorbike rumbling] Don't forget to polish that chrome. I want to shine when I win. [man] Sure. [car doors slamming] [car starting] [sirens wailing] [sirens wailing] Your radio, get me the officer in charge. Now. Sarge. -Hi. -Mrs. Harris, -Detective Hector here. -What is going on here? We have your husband and your boys, everyone is safe. It was a wrongful arrest, I'm afraid. We're escorting them right now to the race track. You're taking them where? His race, we should just about make it in time. Are you insane? No! Mrs. Harris. Oh, no. No, no, no, no. Here. [sirens wailing] I'll, uh, just use your loo, and then I'll be on my way, miss. [Lucy scoffing] Unbelievable. [dramatic music] [keys jingling] [car door slamming] [car revving] [tires screeching] I'm going to be speeding, by the way. -[car engine roaring] -[tires screeching] -[Jake] Good luck, Daddy. -[Michael] Thank you. -Good luck, Daddy. -Thank you. -Go fast. -See you from the stand. [motorbikes rumbling] [Lucy whispering] How long do I have? [motorbikes roaring] [commentator] The riders are lining up for the finals. [motorbikes revving] -[motorbikes roaring] -[commentator] And they're off! A great start from Chris Warren, but local champ, Kevin Jenkins, is having none of that. Jenkins leads, but Mike Harris is catching up. And he's chasing his tail. Jenkins leads. Harris is catching up. He's really giving his all today. Watching as Mike Harris overtakes into the turn. -Unbelievable! -[bike crashing] Oh, Harris is down! Mike Harris is down. Red flag. Harris is down. This looks like a bad one. He's not moving. The helmet's off. Medics, medics. [light dramatic music] Ladies and gentlemen, he's moving. Well, that'll be it for Mike Harris. Mike Harris will be surely leaving the race, ladies and gentlemen. [light dramatic music] [gentle music] Don't worry, he'll be okay. [commentator] And that's it, Mike Harris is out. No, wait, please. Just, my boys are watching. If they see me walk away like this, what does that teach them? I want them to know anything is possible. You're a father, you understand that, right? Please just let me finish this. Just let me race and I promise you, I'll never race again. [commentator] Wait. -Thank you. -[commentator] Incredibly, the Marshall has overruled. Mike Harris is allowed one more race. [announcer] Riders, you have two minutes. [gentle music] [Sam] Mommy and Daddy haven't looked at each other like this since we've been alive. It's something called support... and appreciation. And we should all do it more. -[Michael] What else am I good at? -[Lucy] It's so dangerous. [Kevin] Go and do something important. [Sam] Why didn't you do anything? [Kevin] It's a young man's game. [Jake] You have to, it's who you are. -[Michael] When I'm gone... -[Jake] It's what you love. ...I do not want you boys sat staring into those devices for the rest of your life. [commentator] Riders are lined up. Counting down. [upbeat music] And they're off. An incredible start for Harris. He's flying, folks. Phenomenal turn, I've never seen anything like it. Jenkins battered with dirt. Harris powering forward. This is like the Euro Championship of '94. [crowd cheering] Jenkins gives it all, it's nowhere near enough. [crowd cheering] Ladies and gentlemen, Mike Harris wins. What a celebration this will be. [gentle music] [Sam] Those TV people asked Kevin Jenkins what it was like to be a loser and he declined to comment. [bike wheels skidding] We all make mistakes, it's a part of life. But when we do, it's how we fix them. -[Sam] Keep the change! -[Jake] Sorry again! [Sam] Bye. Come on, let's get back to our cell. [Sam] What goes around comes around. Sometimes we have to accept that things are unfair, but maybe there's a reason. [birds chirping] Now Daddy does drive that old car, but only for special occasions. Ah, Mr. Harris, I presume? And you must be the two young lads. Master Jake and Master Samuel, come this way. [Sam] And what could be more special than visiting England's largest castle? [Butler] Lady Hurst is expecting you, sir. Thank you. [gentle music] May I present, Lady Hurst. Master Jake and Master Samuel. You have both shown incredible bravery and courage, and that must be rewarded. [Sam] I'm sure I saw a tear in Daddy's eye, but of course he denies it. I suppose you're wondering what is in those little posh pouches. Well, here's a little clue. [diamonds rattling] And did I get my dream girl? Well, I'll leave that to your imagination. [bright music] ¶ Locked in time with No space to breathe ¶ ¶ I look around ¶ ¶ What do I see ¶ ¶ A light from afar Comes to guide me ¶ ¶ I have a choice ¶ ¶ I break free ¶ ¶ Is this what my soul's Been dreaming of? ¶ ¶ Feeling the earth Beneath our feet ¶ [Sam] Now it's time for all of us to get off our devices and get out there.

Get ready, everyone else walking in the background. And Rory, on action. Look caught out and say the line. And three, two, one, action. Observe, look back. [Rory] Sorry. [director] Action. And coming through. ¶ Is this what my soul's Been dreaming of? ¶ -[Rory] One more time. -[director groaning] ¶ Feeling the earth Beneath our feet ¶ [director] Quick, Rory, quick, quick, quick! Oh, cut, he's, he's fallen off. I'm Lisa Harris. No, I'm not, I'm Lucy Harris. -I'm sorry. -[director] Okay, just go for that again. Uh. ¶ I'm running free ¶ [director] Did you have the gloves on? -Read the whole thing again. -[Rory] I'm trying to open it. [director] There you go. Look a bit up, yeah. And Felix, turn up in the background, look at each other. Not a smile, you've found, you've found the lot, you're intrigued. Rory, climb in there. I want them to know anything is possible. You're a father, you understand that, right? Please, just, let me finish this, let me race. I promise you... I'll never race again. And then nod your head. Detective Inspector Peter Hector. [Michael] If this is about that-- [chuckling] Do it again, keep rolling, keep rolling. -[director] Action! -You don't know what's going on, do you? -The police-- ugh! -[man] No, "You don't know what's going on." [director] He's adjusting, one scene is down. Ready, and three, two, one, action. Look, jewelry, surely he'll know how to-- Look, it's as I told you. They had one and they took it away with them. -Sorry, I couldn't get the bloody thing. -[director] Cut. -[camerawoman] Rolling. -[director] Take two, get ready. Whoa! Three, two, one, track, action. ¶ I'm running free ¶ Okay, oh, cut. [chuckling] [cameraman] Go, go, go, go, go, go, go! Go, guys, chase. Ow. It's Clint, Clint Eastwood, and he's the best actor who ever lived. And I've messed it up, take it back. [cameraman laughing] Keep rolling. ¶ Brightly over me ¶ ¶ I'm running free Running free ¶ ¶ I'm running free ¶ [director] Okay, cut! ¶ I'm running free Running free ¶ ¶ Colors shine brightly ¶ ¶ I'm running free Running free ¶ ¶ I'm running free Running free ¶ ¶ I'm running free Running free ¶ ¶ Colors shine brightly Over me ¶ ¶ Running free ¶ ¶ Running free ¶ ¶ Running free ¶
