Isn't that funny. All of a sudden she changed the plans. I don't like it. I mean, if, uh... something were to happen in this joint, there's no bouncer. You're a straight-up guy, aren't you, Ed? What did you say to me? I said you were a straight-up guy. Hey, don't tease me. I wouldn't. Good. Let's get out of here. Keep this. Hey? What did you do to Jimmy. Ask Jimmy. I knew his name wasn't Romeo. Yeah, I know. Oh, my god. What's going on, guys? Give yourself up, Miss Crain. I have no desire to hurt you or your friend. Why don't you kiss my ass, Wu? I'd love to. Sam, don't antagonize these guys, huh? Listen to your friend's advice, Miss Crain. There's still a chance I will let you live after this. I admit, it's a small chance, but it could happen. Ha. Don't make me laugh. You're not going to let us go. Possession of the Red Lotus will make me the most powerful man on earth. Once I have the flower, you can go to your police with my blessing. They will not to be able to touch me. No one will be able to touch me. I thought you wanted your flower for your religion? I do not want to be a Kung Fu thug forever. I, too, have ambitions. Well, let me tell you something, halfwit. You're never going to get your flower. And how do you intend to stop me, Miss Crain? Fling your bikini at me? Do you know who this is? Some innocent fool you seduced into helping you? This is the Brain Smasher. He hates Kung Fu. In fact, he thinks it's for wimps. Oh, what... what are you talking... I was just telling you I love that stuff. Uh... Chuck Norris... I got all the movies. You know... the blond guy. Let's kick some ninja butt. We're dead. For the last time, we are not ninjas. ♪ ♪ Miss Crain? ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ You boys aren't allowed back here. Now beat it. Why don't you take a seat out front, fellas? We'll give you something to write home about. Ah, ah, ah, peeking's not allowed. Take your seats out front. You'll see her titties soon enough. Those little guys are kind of cute. Thanks a lot. Don't thank me. Pay me. Well... well, I don't... I don't have $50 on me right now, but uh... this guy that I'm with, he has this watch. It's worth $10,000. I'll just go get him for... You expect me to believe some sucker spent $10,000 on a watch? You listen, princess, I don't work for free. You turn over the cash or I'll turn you over to the ninjas. Sorry. Out of my god damn way, honey. I got a show to do. Miss Crain, if you have any concern for your friend's life, do not take another step. I do not want to hurt you or this man. I simply want what is rightfully mine, what we have been hunting for 2,250 years. Sam, run. Go to your sister. I'll take care of this. Ed? She's in love with you, isn't she? You think so? I'm very happy for you, Brain Smasher. Thanks. I like to see a man die with a smile on his face. We lost her. Perhaps you may yet serve the cause of the Red Lotus. Do me a favor, put me away already, huh? Why don't I just reshuffle your face, then give the beautiful Miss Crain a chance to prove her love.

Cammy. Sam. - Oh, Cammy. - Sam. Oh, Cammy. Oh, you're alive. Oh, oh, cut it out. Of course I'm alive. Why wouldn't I be alive? Well, it's just that I saw Wu go after you... Yeah, so? Don't you start with that model crap, like I'm not capable of taking care of myself. Look, what are you doing here? You're not supposed to be here until noon. Ed... Ed's in trouble. Ed? The botanist has got my number, Ed. All she needs to do is give me a call. If she really loves you, she'll convince her sister to trade the Red Lotus for your life. Hello? Who's this? I want to talk to my son, Ed. It's your mother. Hello? Hello? What, ma? What time are you coming home? I don't know what time I'll be home. Listen... Hang up on her. I won't trade the flower for Ed... period. Well, we can't just let Ed die. He saved my life. You love him. Maybe. You must. I haven't seen you smoke since you were in high school. It's too bad, because in the larger scheme of things, it's more important that Wu never get the lotus. Look, I don't care about all that ultimate power crap. I just care about Ed. Oh, since when have you cared about anything other than your tan lines? Talk about selfish. You make me leave work, smuggle something into the country, practically get me killed, and all without a thank you. But I expect that from you, because you are my sister. Ed is an innocent bystander. Oh, I can't believe I finally care about someone, and he's going to die before I get a chance to sleep with him. Perhaps I should change my name to finger-breaker Wu. What do you think? Too many syllables. Ah. Legend says that the man who takes the petals of the red lotus into his body becomes gifted with unimaginable powers. His... his mind becomes a physical weapon with no limits. Anything he can imagine, he can make happen. If he pictures you dead, you die. If he sees a burning plane, your flight bursts into flames. If he pictures the whole world worshipping him as a god, it will. You don't really believe that, do you? Well, I didn't, but then I found the lotus growing out of snow 20 feet deep, 500miles from the nearest arable soil, just exactly as the legend said it would be. So you tell me, Samantha, is Ed's life, anyone's life, worth more than keeping this out of Wu's hands? You know, Brain Smasher, you and I may have been wrong about Miss Crain. It wouldn't be the first time a beautiful woman used a man then deserted him at his greatest hour of need. What's your problem, Wu, huh? What is it? Your name... Wu? That's what I whistle to a girl down the street. Hey, woo. Ah. What kind of torture is this, anyway? If it's my mother, tell her I'm on the way. Hello? Why, Miss Crain, what a pleasant surprise. ♪ ♪ Cheap theatrics, Miss Crain. They're not cheap, Wu. The Crain sisters... we are doomed. How you doing, Ed? I'll tell you, Sam, uh... I don't remember the last time I had so much fun. Like we agreed over the phone, a straight trade... Ed for the Red Lotus. I still find it very difficult to believe that you would trade ultimate power for an Ed. I hear Ed's got his strong points. You see that Wu. I told you the chick digs me. I got charm, class, charisma. You know I got a mirror above my bed so I'm the first one I see when I get up in the morning. Hey. But, uh... unfortunately Wu's right. I'm not worth... You know it. I know it. But my sister doesn't. The Red Lotus now. ♪ ♪ Gently. And no tricks. No tricks. Just thought you'd want to inspect the prize. Happy now, Wu, you got your flower? What a bunch of crap... ultimate power. Very happy. Ed! Sam. Brain Smasher. Step back, Miss Crain. Ah. You're going to have his babies, right? We just met. I thought you said you loved him. Well, I'm not going to talk about it right here, right now. Well, I'm not giving up the ultimate power unless you say you do. Just say it. You love Ed. Say it or Ed dies. - Ah. - OK. I love Ed. I love Ed. And I want to be Mrs. Ed, uh... uh... Molloy. Molloy, right. I have you outnumbered four to one. Now set the flower down. I'd say we're just about equal. Oh. You used a gun. That's right. This isn't a Kung Fu movie. Now you release Ed or I'll blow your ninja butts to hell. Ugh. We are not ninjas. If I say you're ninjas, then you're ninjas. Hey, Wu? Catch. No. Oh. Sam, the gun. OK. ♪ ♪ Hey, ninja? We are not... If my sister says you're a ninja, you're a goddamn ninja. Ah. What made you think you could ever do this, Ed? You are a loser. Hey, ninja? After this kick, Miss Crain, you will need to earn your living as a hand model. Hey, Wu? End of story, baby. Brain Smasher. Woof. You're going to be part of the family? Stop him. I will destroy all of you. Mm. How are you feeling, Wu? Where is the power? I'm a scientist, Wu. I don't believe in myths and magic. 2,250 years... Hey, honey? I get my face bashed in for a bunch of bull? Says who? Says Madame Butterfly over here, that's who says. I slipped Wu a poisonous stand in from the garden at St. Luke's. You gambled all our lives on a fake flower? It was a calculated risk. Very clever. I tell you what, why don't we split a pedal? Nobody's eating this, not even the rats at the labs. I'm going to win a decade's worth of fully-funded research for selling this to a museum. I'm off to Burma. Oh, what do I tell mom and dad about Christmas? Tell them it's on the 25th of December. You and Ed did good back there. Yeah, for a model and a bouncer. It's tough being a cliche. ♪ ♪ You OK? Yeah, I'm all right. I won't be doing any bouncing for awhile, but I... Sorry about your head. You got nice hands, you know that? They're just hands. Well, you know, I dated chicks with like fat hands, chunky fingers. And I once dated a chick with webbed fingers, you know? But no, I mean it, you really got nice hands. You got nice everything, especially your eyes. You know why? I look into your eyes, I see someone I could really care for. Yeah, what was I thinking, right? You need me. Famous model... you could have any guy. You've got guys giving you $10,000 watches like they're nothing. Pfft. Yeah. Me, Ed Molloy, bouncer, Brain Smasher, right? I mean... You are as stupid as you look. Is that what you think, that I want watches? Nobody ever said the things you say to me. I really like you. Like me? You said before you loved me. I'd say anything to save the world. Oh, yeah? Say it again, Sam. I love you.
