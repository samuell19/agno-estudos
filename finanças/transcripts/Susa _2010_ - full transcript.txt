- Brought it? - Yes. Juja. Juja, come here. Hey, Susa, let's go to my house. - How was your day? - So, so. Earned a total of four lari. Why do not you work in distillery? It is better to collect bottles, than to bother these fucking sales. Do you have vodka? Then let's go faster. Juja, will we play? You're going to lose anyway. - What's the score? - 15:10. You've well practiced. - Again! - No, that's enough. - Oh, please, one more time. - No, let's eat. Have you ever eaten like this? Look. Well, enough already. Otherwise we'll never eat. It's almost ready. I want to show you something. This I have done many times. Wrap the bottle in a towel. If the police get chasing you, just throw it away. That's it, and have a whole bottle. If the cops did not find a bottle, they will do nothing. - Do you want more? - No, thank you. I'm full. Why are you working in distillery? You do not like it? Mother wants me to work with her. I know this. It is true that the boss count on you? Maybe, but I'm tied up with this business. - Why? - Just so. If you leave, you can't return. You'll understand yourself, when you decide to tie. A loaf of bread, please. - Why did not he come back early? - He works. And you know it. - And now when? - About two days later. We still have time. When father returned, do not tell him about the bottle. Then we'll go in distillery. You wanted to town, isn't it? And then we all move to the town. You, Mom, Dad. Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning, my boy. You're already here? Today we need make a good work. - I will go. - Wait, let me see. This button should be buttoned. A heavy bag? - It's ok. - No. I'll take off a couple of bottles. That's enough. - But it's too heavy. - Not at all. Don't come home too late, okay? - For you it's free. You're a good boy. - Thank you. - Hello. - Hello, boy. - Need vodka? - How many you have? - Three bottles. - I'll take one. Wait a minute. I'll give you the money. Pour me some. Come on. - Thank you. Goodbye. - Goodbye. I'LL BE BACK LATE, DELAYED IN THE WORK. MAKE SOMETHING TO EAT AND GO TO BED. What is it? What do I do with this? How to sell it? Does this look like a good vodka? Looks like a piss. And labels? How do you manage it? Your work take none sense at all. Even the cap you can't make normally. Who the hell is this? It is necessary to watch your work! Watch out, don't cut your fingers. You're here? - Had breakfast? - Yes. Wait a minute. Come here. Give me the bag, I'll check it. And that's all you can bear? Go now. Good morning everyone. Spread your cards on the table. We start. Number 29. Number 86. - Brought it? - Yes. - Four bottles? - Yes. Put it there. - For the money come in a couple of days. - No, that is impossible, then I'm gone. Can you wait? Well, well ... They're all so serious. They think they're going to win. Chief, he tried to escape. But I caught him... Bag is empty. What to do with him? Leave it to me. Sit down. You came from Aychaly? Tell your boss, so he did not send here people every day. Take your bag and get out. Oh, Susa, hello, how are you? I can offer a few bottles. I need the money. - How many do you have? - Five. Looking for...? - Is Gena home? - Yes. Close the door behind you. - Oh, Juja, long time no see. How are you? - Slowly, little by little. I have a vodka on sale. Need? Great taste. Here, I have one more. - Let's play? - Not in the mood. - Well, let's play. - I do not want. I will go off from distillery. Don't believe me, do you? If you don't believe me, I will go. Hey, come here. - Where's the money? - I did not work today. Nothing. I need the money. And if he does not come? He will, of course he does. Go to bath, and then buy two loaves of bread, you know? And stay at home at least some time. Dad's on his way. - Where do you go? - To the city. - Sit down. - I'll take the bus. - Get in, we are also going to town. - No, thank you. Sit down, I said. You're coming with us. Relaxing? - Free day? - What? He's back? - Who? - Your father. No, not yet. You think he'll pick you up, huh? Where did he take you? You also return back. I have a difficult times in my life, too. But I, after all, achieved something. I wish you good, man. Yes, good. It's true. What he can do for you? Take off the cap. - Look over there. - Look who's there. - Here. - Wait, we hide out here. Here you are. So you have no money? Just a minute. - I did not work today. - Really? - Look, there's a good place up there. - You do not like it here? I think it's really a good place. Look at his clothes. Keep moving. Now a brick fall on his head. Just look at this jerk. Come on, check it out. I see you've been in the barber shop. The right place, right? - Throw him in? - No, I know another place. Let's make it better. - A little dirt does not hurt. - Get away from me. - Come on. - Get away from me. Wait a minute ... Let me go. No, on the other side. Yes, it is better. This is a lesson for you. I'm going to fix the door. Gia, what are you doing here? Long time no see. Come out, man. Where have you been all this time? - What happened? - Nothing. - What is wrong with you? - I'll tell you later. - He's back? - Yes. What happened? - Where's mother? - At the distillery. - You always go so early? - Yes. - Mother returns late? - It depends. Bring me the salt. Wait a little. Come on. We'll go. Is it heavy? - Give it to me. - No, it is normal. - Give it to me. - It's not heavy. Give it to me, I said. I need to come here. I'll wait for you. Only three bottles. What are you doing there? Take out the bottles. - All? - Yes. No, thank you. And now I... He returned? Come in. Come in, come. What's the matter? What's going on? Stop it. I'm telling you. Damned. Stop now! Calm down. What's wrong with you? Stop! Stop it, I say. Damned. What is wrong with you? Calm down. Enough, I say! That's enough. What do you think? Just you do not want in a good, then you will eat the earth.
