It's Easter time and I'm still real green, right. We're expecting our hot meal in for the day. So these guys run down to the slick when it comes in and there's incoming all over. They drop the meal onto some other crate there and they give us a box of Halloween costumes and decorations. You think these guys tossed them away? They were out there on the LZ with bunting and throwing streamers around like a parade. And there's Jimmy Hendrix blasting all over the place. I kept wondering. My problem was I was wondering what the VC was gonna think about us, like we went nuts or something. Oh god I just couldn't help but dream about home, that's all I could think about. I kept thinking okay, somebody just yell out timeout, start this dream over. And I'd be in it. Home. - Yeah. There wasn't anything to think about but to go home. - Hey Badman, what you gonna do when get home baby? - Man he's coming with me to Miami. - Shit yeah man. Me and Tim here, we're gonna buy ourselves a fuckin' boat and open ourselves up a charter fishing service, man. Permanent R&R in the sun. - Right on. - What the fuck do you know about boats? You're from Pennsylvania. - Man you don't have to know nothing about boats. You just gotta lay back between the controls and rake in all that money from all them fat cat Yankees that come on down. (cheering) - Yes! - Shit man, I don't envy the Coast Guard or nothing man. They're gonna be busy as hell saving your balls everyday. - Check this out. - One foxy lady man. - I tell you though, her little sister's the one. Paula. - She's got a sister? - Yeah right there.

Hun? - Hmm? - We got our third notice. - What third notice? - The TV people. - What about it? - Well you said you were gonna take care of it.

Well what was that stunt all about? - I'm tired of hearing about that goddamn TV. I'm tired of people fuckin' with me. - Oh don't give me that. I know there's something else bothering you and I wanna know what it is. - Don't start with me Paula. Don't start with me. - I'm not, I don't wanna fight, I just wanna know what's going on. (somber music) (loud explosion) (screaming) - Hey, hey man, stay down here and get down. Stay down. What's the matter with you? - Oh Christ. - You okay? - Yeah sure, sure I'm okay. Sure. - Man, you promise you won't laugh if I tell you something? - What is it? - I'm scared. I'm scared shitless. - Oh yeah. Well if you want to man you can hold my hand.

Silver Star, a Bronze Star, two Bronze Stars with valor. Purple Heart, and an Air Medal. Got a real fuckin' hero. - Up yours too. It doesn't buy a cup of coffee. - Yeah no shit. Nice frame though. - You still got yours? - Oh no. I must've lost 'em or something. - Well my wife she just wanted me to keep 'em for the kid, so.

Catch. - [Tim] Vet center? - Yeah well, they uh kinda helped at one time. - What for? - Helped me find a job once, then uh I went down to help out with some of the guys who were a mess. They just had to talk, you know, so they just liked to talk, rap, they gotta rap. - Having all this shit around, doesn't it make ya? Damn, I just wanna forget about it. Viet fucking Nam, what a fucking jerk off. - Yeah well that's pretty specific. I'll drink to that. - [Woman] We are happy to present our child to be baptized. - You have asked to have your child baptized. In doing so, you are accepting the responsibility of training him in the progress of the faith. It will be your duty to bring him up to keep God's commandments as Christ does by loving God and our neighbor. Do you clearly understand what you are undertaking? - We do. - [Priest] Are you ready to help the progress of the child in the duty of Christian of parents. - We are. (baby crying) - We do. We do. (baby crying) (ominous music) (loud explosion) - [Priest] Parents and Godparents, this light is entrusted to you to be kept burning brightly. This child of yours has been enlightened by Christ. - What happened? - I dunno, uh. I dunno it just got on my nerves. It was so hot in there, you know? - It wasn't that hot. Hey is something wrong? - Yes, something is wrong. - Okay. - I just don't feel good, okay? - Fine. Sorry. - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Look it's just, I dunno it just got on my nerves. The baby was crying and. I guess I kinda messed things up, huh? - No, no you didn't. Honey it was just a baby crying, you know? You've heard babies cry before. - I know. - I just want you to be honest with me. - I'm alright. I just haven't been feeling very good. Maybe I'm catching Ronnie's bug. - Look at how green that field is. It reminds me of Nam. Boy all they had was rocks, no grass, when I played on it. You know what my first impression of Nam was? It was that I'd never seen anything so green. I couldn't figure out how could anything with so much life hold so much death. - You played ball? - Yeah, sure. Come on man we better get some work or we can both go on welfare together. - That's not funny man. - I know it's not, but you gotta lighten up. - I can't afford to lighten up. - Okay. Give me 50 cents, I'll go make some calls. - Here, Paula gave me a dollar, you can have half. - All I want is half. Oh, give me the number down by the airport. - Paula? Hi. - Hey. - How are you doing? - Oh fine. - You got time to get a bite or something? - Sure, why not. - Well you know, it's probably temporary. I mean I'm sure as soon as he gets a job he'll be fine, he'll snap right out of it. - God I hope you're right. Listen I gotta tell you something, okay? See it's not just this time, I mean, something else happened too. - What? - See I remember when we first started dating, we'd be like laying out at the park, you know making out and all that. Any little noise, I mean anything, he would jump. And then right after we got married, he would wake up in the middle of the night in like a sweat. You know? - Did he say anything? - Well he said it was just nightmares. Anyway everything just stopped after awhile. The kids came and everything. He never said anything about it. I dunno, I didn't wanna push it. Maybe that was a mistake on my part, I don't know. - Hey, listen it's gonna be okay huh? It'll be fine. - I'm sorry. - [Wendy] It's okay. - Thanks. - [Wendy] Yeah. - There's my boy. Hey Ronnie, come here, I want you to meet somebody. Hey, Ronnie. - No let him be man, he's just scared. Stranger and all that, let him be. - Yeah sure. Kids. Come on, dinner must be almost ready. - Thanks. - You haven't tasted the food yet man. - Hey, do you snore at night? - No. - How do you know? If you're asleep, how can you tell? - My ears are open. - Ah, but how do you know? - [Ronnie] 'Cause my ears are open. - Okay I'll buy that. Okay I'm gonna give you another piece of gum if you pop your muscles and show 'em to me one time. Let me see. OH, oh, we are in trouble. But you won, I'll give you the gum. Here's one for you. And one for you. - He must miss his kid. - Are you in the Scouts yet? - No, he's too young. - Oh really, what are you the big girl? Huh? Gonna hide from me? I'll rub my whiskers on you. What are you looking at? I'll get you too huh. - Get him. - Hey, hey, hey, that's enough. - Well you've done it now Luke. - Come on, come on. - [Ellen] Can't Luke tuck us in? - No, Luke can't tuck you in. - [Ellen] Why? - I don't mind, I don't mind. - You sure? - Sure. - Okay, they're yours. - Okay. - Come on kids. Are these gonna go away some day? - No, they won't go away. They'll always be there. - I love you. - I love you. (intense music) (heavy breathing) (somber music) (intense music) (suspenseful music) (distant rattling) - Look I don't even know if I'm in the right place, so. - Well maybe it isn't and maybe it is, but let's talk about it anyway. What made you think about coming here? - Well, I um, I found this in my husband's coat. - Can you be a little more specific about your husband? Do you think that he is going through changes now that are related to Nam? - Well I wouldn't be here if I didn't think that would I? I told ya I found that in his pocket. And the other morning when I was taking out the garbage, I found his medals and uh, he was throwing them away. - That's uh, not unusual. A lot of the Vets will try to throw away anything that reminds them of Nam. What's his name? - I'm not gonna tell you his name. I don't want you calling him up, telling him I came here. - Do you think that he would be willing to come down to a meeting? - No. - Would you be willing to come down to a meeting of the wives? It'll help you to understand your husband a lot better if you can sit down and have communication with women who have had a very, very similar experience. Yeah? - If it'll help my husband, I'll do anything. - Looks good. I think we can use you. - Man it's good to hear those words again. - Yeah I bet things have been hard out there. - You ain't a kidding. - Yeah how about uh, can you start next Monday? - Man I can start today, I got no problems at all. - Fine, fine, how about a cup of coffee. - Uh no, no thanks. - Well you know I noticed on your application that you were in Vietnam. - Yes sir I was. - Was in the Core myself. Yeah now that was a real war. - I'm sure it was. - Yeah. I landed on Iwo Jima. Second wave in. You know I went to basic training for 10 weeks with a kid called Eli Kyle. He was the first one to get it, as soon as the doors opened on that landing craft. Do you know what the tragedy is about Vietnam? Nobody really knew why the hell we were there. - Yes well uh, I guess. - You know I got a kid, just about your age. You know how he got outta that war? Smart kid. He went out and found a doctor, had him write a letter saying he had a bad back and that's how he got out. First of course, you know, I was really pissed. I mean when you get called to serve your country, you go, just like I did. Sorry to have to say it but, the old US government, Johnson, Nixon, you know they really had you pulled in, they really sucked you in. Nobody honestly wanted to go to Vietnam. There was nothing there. It was nothing but a suckers war, that's all it was. (intense music) (loud smashing) - Ted! Ted what's going on? What the hell did you do? Okay game time, you wanna take it out, you wanna take this place out? - No. No. No, come on man. Come on. - Oh you, you're lucky. (screaming) Hey see this man. - What? - This man is the very site of my greatest moment. We were up 20 to 16 with about a minute left to play in the game. Century, they were driving, they had the ball right on the 12. Oh man I gotta show you this. I gotta show you this. - [Ted] What? - [Luke] Alright, you're that guy from Century. - [Ted] No I don't wanna be that. - [Luke] Yeah you gotta be the guy from Century, he's just a candy ass. - [Ted] I don't wanna be. - [Luke] His name is Weber. And he's got a big winning smile. The biggest hotdog you ever saw. Okay, alright. Now you stand there. Okay. I'm playing safety and they send their guy out. That's you. - Me? - Get over there. Okay, now I'm in the middle, I'm in the middle, I look over, I look over, and you've just faked out a man that's covering you. - I just faked you out man. - And I haul ass after ya, quarterback releases the ball, and Weber's with his arms out waiting. Lift your arms and smile, smile you fuck! (screaming) And I grab the ball and it popped free, I got the sucker, and I waltz 102 yards for a touchdown. And the crowd, they went nuts. - You made me spill my beer, you fuck. - Fuck your beer. I just told you the greatest moment of my life. And I lied about the touchdown. 17 years it's been. So long ago it was. And I haven't had anything like it since. Dammit. It was supposed to be like this, you know? It was supposed to be different. It was supposed to be better. I mean I didn't expect much, I didn't expect. I mean, no horseshit parade. Besides when I got back from Nam my fuckin' feet were killin' me. I expected to live, I just expected to live my life. I have the love of my wife and son. But somebody, some asshole changed the rules to the game in the middle of the fuckin' play. Nobody dropped the flag. I wanna tell ya man, sometimes I think that the guys we lost over there have it better off. - Surviving, coming back, that's the real hell. - Well they came through the wire one night, I don't know how many. Boy we fired and fired. There was just this big wall of people coming at us. And they overran our position. (somber music) I don't know what happened after that. I still have dreams. They said that we were overrun and that we fought hand to hand for four hours. I don't know if that's true or not. And the next day they found me alive. I was the only one there and I was still hugging this sapper. I mean I was still hugging him and I just like held him, kept jamming my knife into him. Every now and then I wake up in the middle of the night and I see his face, his eyes are open, and he's begging me. (crying) - Come on Luke, let's go home. Let's go home. - Home. - I'm home. Hey, I said I was home. - You're late. - Well I'm hungry. - Well then you should've come home when it was dinner time. - Honey don't give me any shit, just make me something to eat, alright? - Stop it. - Well what the hell is wrong with you? - Oh there's nothing wrong with me. - Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit, bullshit. What the hell is wrong with you? - Would you just leave me alone? Just go fall asleep somewhere. Take your drunken stupor somewhere else. - Hey, hey, hey, hey, listen, lady, I don't have to take any shit from you. - Let go of me. - Would you just tell me what's wrong then? - Nothing is wrong. Tim is this gonna be the new thing now, you coming home drunk every night? - Oh Jesus, I don't need this shit, I don't need it. - [Paula] Well neither do I. - Well then let's just forget it alright, just forget it! - No I'm not gonna forget it. I wanna know what the hell you think you were doing the other night. - What night? - The night your son saw his father crawling around the living room with a knife! That night! Dammit what is wrong with you? - I don't know what you're talking about. - You know damn well what I'm talking about. - [Tim] I don't know what you're talking about. - You're gonna answer me. You are! - I don't wanna talk about it. - You had your son scared half to death. - I don't wanna, let go. - You gotta talk about it. - I don't want, dammit let go of me. (loud thudding) (screaming) Paula. - Don't touch me. - Paula. I'm sorry. - Get away from me. - Oh no, my god. Paula. - [Paula] Get away from me! - [Tim] Paula. - Go away. (crying) Ronnie, come on Ronnie. Ronnie. Ronnie, come on. (calm country music) Well? (somber music) I still have some dinner left if you're hungry. I haven't put it up yet. Tim I was worried about you. I even called around looking for you, you know. I'm just glad you came home. - I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. - I know. - I've been thinking about things, I've been thinking a lot about it. At first I, I thought I could say it was, you know an accident, I was drunk. But it was no accident. I'm sorry for hurting you. - [Paula] Oh I love you. I love you so much. - I'm thinking and going over and over and I don't know how or what it is. Something so deep, so deep inside of me. Sometimes I just pray to God that he would just. Oh Paula I need help. - Hi I'm Larry uh I was in Vietnam 67,68, uh I was with the First Air Cav. - Uh Bill West, Third Marine Division, force recon. I was stationed at Pleiku, 70, 71. That's about it. - Charles P. Harris. - [Rob] You ever find out what the P stands for? - Not exactly. Anyway, stationed in Cam Ranh Bay, truck driving all the way to Saigon, Phan Thiet, partial the way. And that was in 70 to 71 but it was a trying time in my life, you know. - Name's Eric, Third Marines. 68, February, when uh, when the good times used to roll. - Uh Tim Murphy, First Cav, High Core, 70, 71. Did our part in uh An Khe. - Sergeant Gerald Stanley, you can call me Gerry. - [Rob] Oh good. - Ninth Infantry Division, reconnaissance, lurps, 67, 68. - There is no way that we can forget Nam. Not unless we get a lobotomy or something. We have got to learn how to use our experience. We've gotta use the negative and we've gotta use the positive and we've gotta make it work for us in our daily life now. (somber music) - I know I should give these cigarettes up, I don't even like 'em. Sometimes I think they're the only thing that keeps me going. He never hit me. I mean it was never anything like that. My husband and I really tried. At least I think we did. Sure hasn't been easy. Then again maybe it's not supposed to be. But I know that I tried and I still don't understand what's happening. - It's not so easy. I mean what have we experienced that we could ever compare it to? - You know I'm not really scared of him, I never have been. But I guess what I am scared about is how, well, what he would do to himself and like how he was affecting us. But I still loved him and that's the part that really hurts. Sometimes I wish that love was like a faucet, you know, how you could just turn it on and off. I'm sorry. - Here you go. - Thank you. I get so tired of what's going on. I get so tired of watching him destroy all the wonderful things about him that I love so much. And my kid, he idolizes him. And I can see the pain in his eyes and I know that he knows. I know that he knows that his father is. I am so tired of it. I am so tired of what's going on. I don't know if we're gonna get back together again, but sometimes I don't really care. I am so tired of Vietnam. - You're late. (giggling) What? - What? - What was that for? - What? - That? What is it? You're hiding something from me, what is it? - Oh well you know me so well, why don't you figure it out? - Did you get a job? - Mm hmm. (squealing) - [Paula] That's wonderful! Where!? Wait I'm sitting on a plate. Oh I don't care. - [Tim] I'm working at Madam Woo's Sex Shop. (laughing) - How's the group going? - Fine. - Yeah? - Yeah I'm learning. - The other day I had a woman Vet come in and we were just talking and she said to me, I wanna go back. And I said to her why? She said to me, I wanna go back and find something that I left there. I said what is it you wanna find? She said, I wanna find the me that I was before Vietnam. And every one of us has something that we have left there. Paula we gotta talk. Tim is not opening up and I don't think he has any intention at all of opening up. He's faced the fact that he has a problem, but that's all he's gonna face. He's frustrating me. - Did he tell you that he got a job? - No. I'm glad. - Listen Rob, I think everything's gonna go back to normal now. I really do. - Bullshit. You think it's that simple? You think he can just get a nice job, fall right into the flow of society and everything's gonna be wonderful? - Well all I know is he didn't have this problem before he lost his job. - He had this problem long before he met you Paula. - We'd been out about 10 days. We were checking out these hoochers about four clicks from the LZ. Nothing special. Just a bunch of fucking gook hoochers. You've seen them, hundreds of them, nothing special. Bobby, he was my pal, we went through ITR together before we got shipped over. I mean we'd been together in country from the first. - What about the hoochers? - We cleared out the locals, moved 'em up away from the village so we could do a house to house check. Bobby, he was by the door of this one hooch, calls out to me, someone left a baby in here. I can hear it crying. I can hear the baby crying. I looked at him, you know, like he was full of shit or something. That baby was just crying. So Bobby goes in the hooch and he calls out to me that there's a baby. Oh Jesus. The baby, the hooch, it blew up. It was all booby trapped. He was just trying to help the baby. - Get some Koolaid. - Okay. - Whew! - Whoa what's all this about? - This is definitely not early Lukian. Just thought it was time to clean up my act. - You look like a used car salesman. - Oh give me a break, this is my new jacket. This is my only jacket. Anyway I thought I'd just drop by and say hello. I haven't seen your face, not since we've been hustling jobs. - You found something? - Eh, it looks that way. No I start next week. - Good news! Well looks like things are turning around for us. What uh? - Yeah but that's not the real news. I mean what all this get up is for. Tonight, the night, me and my old lady, just the two of us. - Well that's great man. - Yeah we're going down to Mike Gordon's at the bay. - Nice place. - Yeah, yeah, that's where we used to go when we were dating and then we're gonna do a little two footin' and then. Oh I tell ya it's just like old times, that feeling's back. - So you're pulling out all the stops huh? You're not nervous are you? - You can tell huh? It's been awhile. - Well listen man, you know how I feel, I hope everything goes great. - Thanks. Alright. (laughing) Alright give me a call later, will ya? - I'll do it, I'll do it. - Oh, I got a surprise for you. - What? Oh man, come on. What? Man. What am I gonna do with this? - Marry it. - How's it going? - I'll be damned. I at least got the radio to work. - Good. It's nice and warm tonight. - You know what this reminds me of? - What? - Nights like this we used to go to the beach, park and spark. - Yeah after you went out carousing with your buddies. You remember that time that Renee caught us. - Oh yeah. - Boy I had one pissed off sister. - Well especially since I stood her up. - You know I always knew if I could get you to go out with me just one time, I had you. - Oh really? Huh? Really uh, sure of ourselves weren't we? - Well let's just say that I knew what you needed. You know I remember all of our dates. You used to tell me how much you loved me. - I had to say something so I could get in your pants. - Didn't work did it? - Not all the time. - I sure am glad I married you. - I'm glad you married me too. You know uh, I know things haven't been so. - Shh. - [Ellen] Mommy, Ronnie's flooding the bathroom. - Right on cue. Never fails. I don't know how we ever had Ronnie. (phone ringing) Luke? Hello? - Hey buddy. - Hey man, how'd it go? - What's the word? - Tell me, what happened, how'd it go with your wife? - The word's out, Charlie's coming, but Charlie's coming tonight. - What's going on man? - She went and did it. I never thought she would do it. - What happened? - She uh, she went and filed for divorce and stuff. She uh, she said she met someone, someone else, someone that she can love. - Oh man I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. - It's no problem man, it's just no problem at all. - Luke, do you wanna go have a beer? How's that sound man, huh? Yeah come go out with me, we'll have a couple beers. - The word's out man, I said the word's out. - Please Luke uh, come on go out with me and have a couple beers. Come out with me tonight man. - I'm at the wire man. - No man there is no wire. - I can see Charlie. I can see it coming through the wire. - It's over Luke, it's all over, you're not in Nam. - It's gonna overrun us. - [Tim] Please Luke don't. - It's gonna overrun us again. - Oh dear god Luke, please listen to me man. (gun shot blasting) (intense music) (explosions blasting) - Tim! (somber music) - Well there you are. Where'd you go? Are you not gonna talk to me? What happened? I'm not gonna go back in the house. I'll sit out here all night if that's what you want. I wanna know what happened. - Do you wanna know what happened? Luke just blew his fucking brains out. - [Paula] Oh god. - Just talked on the phone, talked about his wife, talked about Vietnam, then he just blew his brains out. When I got there they were already taking him away. - Oh honey I'm so sorry. - God I don't want your sympathy. I don't want your sympathy. I don't need it! - Tim, stop it, you're scaring me. - Scared? You know what scares me? I'm scared when you can't see 'em and you know they're out there, you know they're out there, but you can't see 'em. And then they, and then they start walking those mortars in on ya, they start bringing 'em in, walking 'em over ya. Nothing can stop 'em. - I wanna help you, but I don't know how. I don't understand. - Oh god get out of here! (whimpering) You don't understand. None of you people understand! You're going to the prom, we're going out in the fucking bush. - Stop it. - Jesus I can't take the pressure. (whimpering) Make 'em stop please. Help please. Shh, shh, shh. Did you hear that? They're coming through the wire man. Get down, they're coming through the wire. Oh Jesus I can smell 'em, I can smell 'em, I can always smell 'em. We'll waste 'em, we'll waste 'em all. Rafer? Rafer, where's the cover man? Where's the cover man? Rafer, where's the cover man? Oh my god, oh my god. - No! - Where's my gun, where's my gun? - Stop it! - No. - Stop it! - Where's my gun? - Stop it! You're not gonna do this to me! I'm not gonna let you do this to my family! You're not in this by yourself, I'm here! Listen to me! I love you. (sobbing) - Oh my god. Oh god. - Present arms. Port arm. Prepare to fire. Fire. (gun shots cracking) (military taps music) - I heard you were his good friend. Paula, thank you very much for being here. - She's in my group. I didn't know. Tim, I didn't. She never mentioned him by name. - I'll meet ya at the car. - Tim. He didn't have to die. Did he? (somber music) - Everyday I could feel the seconds, the minutes. Everything around you meant something. You felt and heard everything. The air, sun shining on your face, nothing was lost to you. Funny isn't it? There's death all around you. You never felt more alive in your life. When someone bought it, it hurt, but you just kinda tried to laugh it off, turn your back on it. You say, it was his turn, hell with it. You even start to believe that you're invincible. Nothing was gonna get you. Sons of bitches still hadn't invented the bullet that was gonna get you. (ominous music) There was a village. Intelligence said that it was a NVA stopover point. Maybe even a POW camp. We went in before sunrise, landing a few clicks from the village. It was a two company operation, us from the southeast, the other company from the north and west. My fire team was just entering the village area. It was me, Sanchez, Rafer, and the Badman. (intense music) - [Rafer] Shit man I told you guys Charlie had booked on outta here. - [Sanchez] Yeah he knows I got three days to go and I'm kicking ass, Jack. - Fuckin' A. - Hey what's that sound? It's a buzzing from over there. - Fuck it looks like a well. - Let's check it out. - Stay away from there man. - Ready, go. (loud buzzing) Man I told you to stay away from there. - Oh no! No! - I told you to stay away from there. (gun shots blasting) - Stay down man, get back. (yelling) Get out! (loud explosions) (screaming) - Help me! Don't leave me here. Don't leave me here. - No way I'm leaving you. Come on. (screaming) - Come on! (intense music) - No, no wait man. Wait Badman, he's coming man. I can see him, there he is, he's crawling man. He's alive, dammit he's alive. (loud explosion) Get him. - [Soldier] Forget it man, they're gonna shoot us down. - Look, look I can see him crawling man. He's alive! He's alive, please sweet Jesus. - Tim! - Please, please don't let him die. I saw in the well man, I know what they'll do to him. I saw in the well. Please don't let him die. Jesus. - Tim! - Badman forgive me. Forgive me. (gun shots echoing) (sobbing) I'm sorry. (crying) (peaceful music) - Welcome home.
