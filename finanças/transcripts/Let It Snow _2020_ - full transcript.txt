What? Every year. The same song, over and over again. And you know they're gonna be playing it on repeat at the hotel. Non-stop. You know what? I'm switching it. Okay there, Miss I Hate Christmas Music. Mmm... that's better. - Top secret mission for you. - Mmm, that so? Yes. Your mission... is... - You ready? - Mm? Take the wheel while I take a nap! No, no, no, no, no! Are you crazy? Don't do it! Have you seen the fall? - Yeah. - You're crazy. Sorry. Why don't you just run off a cliff? Hmm... Just got about 35 minutes more to go... and it'll be just us, snow, two boards, and freedom! Freedom. Look at all the snow. - I know, right? - Uh-huh. It's gonna be sick on the Black Ridge. I heard it's like standing on top of the world. I mean, I promised you an awesome vacation and an awesome vacation you shall receive. Seems pretty empty. I hope there aren't tricycle riding twins in there. Oh, don't worry. All work and no play has made this Max a very dull boy who wouldn't dream of coming to beat you to death with an axe. Oh, really? Well... that is so very kind of you. In return, I hope not to turn into... A rotting old woman while I take a bath. Deal! Good afternoon. Welcome to Georgia Ski Hotel. I hope you had a pleasant journey here. Yeah, it was great. Awesome views. Yeah, it's something else here. Yes, "something else" is specialty here in Georgia. What's the name for your reservation? - Max Spellman. - Give me your ID, please. Skiing or snowboarding? We're freeriders. I've actually even competed a few times. What, bragging already? Nah. If anything, you're the impressive one. You know, two years ago she never set foot on a board, and now she's a regular snow demon. Would you like me to order a pass for you? Ah, it's okay. We've got other plans, actually. Yeah, the Black Ridge. He's been going on about it forever. Then I am sorry to inform you that the Black Ridge is inaccessible. We came all the way from America. Isn't there a way to get there? Snowmobiles used to take people there, but they finally fenced off area last month. What about a helicopter? I don't think someone would be willing to fly there. Please. This is an important trip for us. I got something special planned on the Black Ridge. There something you could do to help? People disappear there. Experienced riders. We won't get arrested if we go snowboard there, will we? There are other places you can go. More beautiful and... less dangerous than the Black Ridge. Danger? That's exactly what we're after. I hope you enjoy your stay, and that you find what you're looking for on other slopes. - So... the receptionist, huh? - Nice lady. Yeah, sure. And creepy as hell. Come on. She's probably just this unsatisfied, likely single woman who happens to hate every happy couple that arrives at her hotel. Or she is... secretly a masked murderer who sucks the souls out of her male victims and kills them with her creepy eyes. After you. Ah! Nice. Epic. Pretty great, huh? I mean... it's beyond great. A portal to another world. Mm... I feel... like they're watching me from up there. You know? Hmm... Your Mom and Dad? Yeah. They loved each other so much. Reminds me of us. I wish I could have met them. - Mm. - I know they'd want you to be happy. Yeah. I will be. And I know, from up there, they're really looking down on you and just wishing, you know, just wishing... that you wouldn't smoke that cigarette because smoking is so bad for you, and it's really, really gross. Dick! I'm having a serious moment of introspection here. Yeah, I know. I know. - And I'm here for you. - Mm, yeah? You know our adventure is just beginning. Yeah? The mighty Max, defeated on his holiday by his own fearsome laptop. Well... I have a lurking suspicion that whatever email you're writing isn't going to be quite as satisfying as what I have in store for us. What would you do if I asked you to marry me right now? I'm gonna go stretch my legs, okay? Wine? Present from our hotel to the young couple. Oh, wow. That's so nice. Thank you. Sorry, you scared me. Thanks. I just wanted to tell you something. You shouldn't go to the Black Ridge. Five days ago, a man disappeared there. He and his wife were staying here, with us... and now the rescue group just called. Found his body. I'm sorry to hear that. Thanks for your concern. We'll definitely think about it. Good night. Thank you for the wine. Hey, something weird just happened. Can you get up and take a look at it? - I'm sleeping, babe... - Please. The receptionist just brought us some wine. - Oh... nice. - Yeah, but then she... drew a cross. A cross? - Can't see anything. - What? It was just here. Well... big day tomorrow. Let's get some shut-eye. Wow, the Christmas mood sure died fast. Still got the damn music though. Maybe the Grinch came by and stole everything? Friend of yours, I presume? Hi, good morning! Thank you so much for that gift last night. It was really nice. Appreciate it. - Helicopter is already here. - Ah! Great! Cool. Well, see you. Come on. Cross. I'm sorry for your loss. It's as we feared. Come. Let's get you more coffee. - Whoa! What happened? - Nobody knows. Weird. Yes. Strange death. Like someone killed him and left him on the Black Ridge. Really though, it looks like he just had a bad fall and froze. Maybe... Maybe not. Don't worry. Stay safe and Merry Christmas! Bye. Well... that was fun. Let's go. Not the best advertising for a trip, huh? Yeah... You okay? Are you sure this is a good idea? What do you mean? I don't know. Something about all this... feels a little off. Maybe we should do something else? - Mia... - Hmm? I get it. I know what you're feeling. It's natural. I mean, after you see somebody fall, or catch a bad break, you feel off. Hell, it'd be weird if you didn't. Listen... that guy... was an idiot. All right? He went up in a place way beyond his ability by himself. But you and I, we're smart, right? We got each other, and we got experience on tough slopes. I'm a little outclassed by you in that regard. No, you're a natural. Pretending to fall in front of you in your beginner snowboarding class was the best decision I ever made. You tripped and you know it. I promise, baby, this trip's gonna be unforgettable. If you say so. It's gonna be sick, so sick! Good morning. American, you're late. Yes, sorry. Sorry about the delay. How's the snow looking, huh? Snow is always beautiful. Yeah. Hey, why don't you take the front? I'll be right there. Hey, so listen. We're gonna... I know we said, we're going to Penzel? But we're going to need to change that and go to the Black Ridge. Very dangerous. I-I don't understand what the big deal is about this mountain. Why can't we just... go there. We came all the way from America. I feel there's something I can do for your troubles. Here. Appreciate the understanding. Okay, great. Let's go. What's that cross over there? Several years ago, two freeriders hit a young girl. They left her to die in the snow. Her parents put a cross over there in her memory. She was the daughter of an emergency rescuer. Some people say the ghost of the girl now lives on Black Ridge and kills tourists. Especially freeriders, like you. Maybe we should watch out for ghosts then? What? I'm just kidding. I don't believe in ghost stories. But a lot of people do disappear there. There. That's the Black Ridge, on the left. You realize any normal person would think we're crazy, right? Being normal is boring. Shall we? - You ready for this? - Yeah! Okay, let's do this! Yeah! You know, I think I'm in love. Over. Yeah? With this damn mountain or a particular special someone? Over. You know damn well it's you. Over. I love you, too. Idiot. I'm gonna take some pictures. Over. Okay, I'll meet you down in the valley. Max! There is a heavy fog. Where are you? Over. Max? Max, where are you? Over. - Hello? - Max? Come on. Come on, Max. Yo! This is Max Spellman. Leave me them deets. Damn it. It's gotta be a joke. It's gotta be a joke. It's gotta be a joke. No... Fuck. No. Fuck. This Christmas, we're going on a romantic trip. We are? Yeah. I thought I'd surprise you. We're going to Georgia. Are we... are we visiting your parents? No, no, no, not the state. The country in Europe. Oh, what's in Georgia? Well, like, only the best snow, the greatest slopes for snowboarding. - And gorgeous mountain views. - Mm. It'll be perfect. - Perfect for what? - For us. Max? Max! There you are! I thought we lost each other! You won't believe the weird thing that just happened to me. Max? Max, is this one of your jokes? Max? This is not funny! Are you okay? Max! Max! Max! No! Hey! Where is he?! - I had a dream. - Yeah? - Mm-hmm. - What about? Um... It was us, and we were in a big house, and you were cooking your very famous sloppy joes. Mmm... You're making me hungry. - You're always hungry. - Oh, only for you. And you were cooking, and then I came in, and I was carrying this beautiful little girl. Our girl. And she had your stupid cheeky smile. That sounds nice. Thank you. Where am I? Do you speak English? I'm sorry, I don't understand. Bad place. Please, you have to... you have to help me find my boyfriend. I'll pay you. Phone? Telephone... Max. My boyfriend. He was with me. He was wearing a green suit. Green. And someone took him. Grabbed him and... tied him up. Please, help me. Drink! What is it? Drink! Chach. Chacha.
