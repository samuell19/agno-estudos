So, day or night, and for your own safety, stay at all times within the confines of the camp. Mr. Sztuhr? What incidents? Nothing worth mentioning. Keep your eyes open, stay away from the locals, and remember we're being watched at all times. I'll be making random checks, so make your beds, brush your teeth, take your showers, and make your confessions to Father Pelayo. When needed. And remember. Posture! Punctuality! Penance! - Please play the song, man. - Yeah, it's awesome. No, man. - You saw what Pollo did? - You mean the ritual? Yes, the ritual. He did the ritual. You have to be naked, right? Yeah, you cover yourself with a sheet, naked, and then you light a candle. - You open the Bible at page 666. - Of the Old Testament. - No, the New one! - It's the New Testament! - No, the Old one. - The New one, man. Same difference. Whatever! You stare into the mirror, and your face changes into a demon. He was with the black girl, no shit. Do you have a problem with that? She had beautiful green eyes. I don't know about you guys, but I had sex with Cristina. What about Mariana? I don't know about you, but I want that asshole off my bed. Scholarship boy. What's he doing in this school anyway? - Let's beat his ass. - He should go back to his village. Don't worry about it. We'll do it tonight, man. - Right now. - We'll beat the shit out of him. Asshole. Doesn't know who he's messing with. - Let's go, guys. - Fucking beaner. You nailed it, man! You really nailed it. - Where are you off to? - Shut up! I love you, man! - You're next, asshole! - Eduardo! Get up, motherfucker. What's wrong with you guys? Fucking brownie! You're dead meat, brownie! Get him out of here! Shit! They dragged him to the bathroom. I saw him take that bunk for himself. - They're gonna bit him up. - And it's his first night. - Stay still! - Leave me be. What a beautiful moment. I think... I need a souvenir. Cut his hair. Cut it all off. Oh, so handsome. He wet his pants! Pour forth, we beseech Thee, O Lord, Thy grace into our hearts, that we, to whom the incarnation of Christ, Thy Son, was made known by the message of an angel. May by His passion and cross be brought to the glory of his resurrection. Amen. Medicine time, kids! Come here! Fito Salinas! Bryan Rodriguez! Raul Reyes! Jordi de la Torre! Diego Peña! Fito Salinas. Move, I'm in a hurry. Dante Amu... Dante Amuchastegui! Eduardo Calderon! Gross. I'm not drinking from there. Thanks for nothing. Hey. Diego! Come on, hustle! Coming, coming. Edwin, can I skip my pills today? They make me drowsy. Listen, I know all about your medicine. I can assure you they're good for you. I speak from personal experience. And it's not about wanting or not wanting to take them. You need them. Or do you want to be all down in the dumps again? Please, Edwin, just for a few days. They give me nightmares. Calm down. In a few years you won't even feel them. Here. I'll give you vitamin B, these two blue ones, one sertraline, and one citalopram. With a little water. Relax, brother. Bird watching club! Survival club! Let's go! Get moving! My boys are working. Move! Tanaka? Tanaka, do we have any water? Careful, careful! Watch that axe. Hey, sir! Can't you see I'm working, asshole? Move over. Do your work with love. Let's go! Jordi, what are you doing? I'm tired of being a slave, Monteros! Jordi, quit whining and get to work. What is it, Jordi? What is it, son? Why are we doing all this? I know! Because it's a survival club, Mr. Monteros. Of course, but that's not the only reason. Mr. Sztuhr, what are the essentials for man to survive? Oxygen, water, food, shelter, and self-defence. Exactly! What else do we need in our lives? Something to protect us from evil. - Pepper spray. - Police. No, something intangible that will protect our order from harm. Money. Oh, my God! Exactly, Jordi! That's what I wanted to hear. God, our faith, and Jesus. The only things which will protect us. I know you might find this confusing, but soon you'll understand the huge... power these two sticks have in our lives. Mr. Tanaka. Back to work, kids! Before being brutally slaughtered, the inhabitants of this place were the greatest assassins of the Aztec empire. - And they lived here? - Yes. This land is made up of layer upon layer of indigenous weapons. Indigenous shit, indigenous blood, indigenous bones. And who knows? Perhaps their descendants are still around. I don't think so. Look, boys. - Wow! Did you see that? - See what? I don't see anything. Turdus Albocintus, I thought they were extinct. Look over there. Black, with a white collar. Where? Let me see. May I use them? Turdus Albocintus. Some consider it the most vindictive and intelligent creature in the world. The Turdus steals, kills, and it also rapes. They live in forests and, for centuries, they've formed an impenetrable male-only society. And it is said, that in secret, males mate with each other, sometimes even with the group's youngest members, offering them food as a form of courtship. Or by using force. It's still a mystery to science how the species has survived without female participation. - And for so long. - Maybe they're hermaphrodites. It's possible, but science hasn't determined it yet. Look, over there, fix your sight-line. It's really clear. White neck. On the main trunk, slightly to the right. See it? Oh, yes! How about that? It's beautiful. - Wait! - No shit. It moved! It's over here now. Half an hour just staring at a stupid bird. We've reached the end! Stay together, boys. - How cool is that? - Don't go near. Don't touch it. And don't run. Stay away. It says high voltage. Don't touch, dude. - Dude, what the fuck? - Stay away from it. What is that? - Don't go near. - No shit. - What the fuck? - Holy shit. An animal looking for shelter. An animal didn't do that. - Why not? - Don't touch it. - Dude, that's gross! - It's oil. It's not oil, man. It's blood. Nothing to see here. What do you mean, nothing to see? Let's go. There's nothing to see here. Let's go back to camp! No fucking animal could cut through that. - Stay together. - Back to camp. Let's go eat. Who knows what happened here. Tie your shoelaces. Let's go eat. Like Everest? Smaller, but I think they're the smallest of the world's highest. What kind of animals live there? There's an animal called Kausi. It's half goat, half donkey. I'm serious. I touched the blood and it was boiling. And it smelled like crap, for real. Yeah, it was gross. It smelled like dick. It smelled like Moncardo's shit. According to Gordillo, this place is filled with crap. It's screwed up. Cut it out, that's just stupid. Must be some Aztec ghost. Aztec ghosts my ass, guys! Jordi, we all know this is no joke. In those poor, shitty towns there's everything: traffickers, kidnappers, robbers. You've no idea. Seriously, you need to stop watching Narcos. Stop talking bullshit. Even the mayor and the army are involved. Aren't you scared? This is really, really weird. - Seriously weird. - I'm scared. I'm scared some Aztec ghost will show up or something. And what's up with the blood? There was a strange vibe down there. - Why, what happened? - There was a bad vibe. Yeah, like an evil bad vibe. Like spiritual or something. What do you think happened? I think the villagers, the drug lords are gonna kidnap us and... we're all acting as if we were happy, but we're actually anxious. I don't think we're acting. Everybody looks worried. - Five people... - People with rifles. Shut up, dudes! This is serious shit. Boys! All activities are cancelled today. So you have the afternoon off. Use this time to meditate and look after each other. - Got it? - Yes, sir. - Yes, Jordi? - We should call the police. - Who? The police? - Yes. Out of the question! The police can't come to our camp, so don't talk nonsense, alright? Yes, go ahead, Can we send someone to the village shop? Stop eating! You've already been told it's strictly forbidden to leave camp. Besides, you haven't even finished your meal. Are you already thinking about your next meal? No, sir. Well, you heard. Take the afternoon off. Let's do the mud slide! Take it easy, bro! Eat dirt, you bitch! One, two, three! Help! Edwin! Help! Please! What's going on? He's drowning! Help him! - He's not breathing! - Edwin, do something! Oh, no! He's dying. Stand back! He's not breathing! What the fuck? What's your problem? He's got a boner! He tried to kiss me. Kill him! It's not working. Here. You need to press that. Harder. Like this, look. That happened to me the first time. It burns. It's cool. I don't like it. Let's go swimming. They say swimming in cold water makes your dick grow. Fuck it, come on. Come on. Get in the water. Get in, it's warm. Come. One, two, three! It's freezing. - I lied. - No, really? Here, help me out. Holy shit! What the fuck? Didn't you say your dick would grow? I think mine shrank. Right. Once you're in, it's not as cold. Yeah, right. Look at my skin. Good afternoon! - Are we interrupting? - 'Course not. Did you know being gay goes against school rules? So what? Go and tell the teachers. Oh, that's so romantic, Defending his man. How sweet! Sorry, Jordi, we're not gay. Let us come out. Don't apologize. Poor thing. I'm getting out. Where are you going? Hold on, put on some clothes. Get decent. There are children here. We wouldn't want to ruin your date, right? Carry on, don't mind us. In fact, would you like some champagne? You know what I'd like to see? A kiss. Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Tell us, Joaquin, why did you bring him here? The truth. - To fuck him! - You wanted to fuck him! No, seriously. I have a question. Who sticks it in? - Neither of them has a dick. - That's right. Hold on, where are you going? Wait! Don't leave. We just got here, brownie. We scared them off. Don't leave us, prince! Come here, I'll show you! Get him! You're dead meat! What now? Fuck, dude. What are you gonna do? What the fuck, man? Holy shit! Josue! Your nose, man! What the fuck is wrong with you, motherfucker? You broke his nose, you asshole! You're a fucking animal! Don't move, Josue. - Hold his head. - Lift his legs. Don't move his head! Keep it still. I'm holding him. Josue, stay with me. We're gonna get help. I got him into this, but you're gonna get it too. - Did you see that, man? - Enough, okay? What happened, son? - What happened to you? - He hit me. Good afternoon. Professor. - How are you? Nice to see you. - Likewise. - Hello. - Sztuhr. Pleasure. We are terribly embarrassed. But you know, boys will be boys. He's a new boy. Scholarship kid from a family with no manners. It's about time the little savage learned some! Don't worry, madam. He'll be taught a lesson. Say you're sorry. I'm sorry. Once more, like you mean it. I'm sorry. Now shake hands. That won't be necessary, sir. Oscar. I'll be right there. - How are you? - Very well, my dear minister. This place hasn't changed. It's been what, 20 years? I'd love a quick peek, to remember the good old days. What do you say? Besides, I need to make a pit stop. Don't ask me to do that, son. You know the kids are here to connect with God. Seeing you would disrupt the experience. We all enjoy recalling our childhood, sir. But it's better not to interfere, don't you think? Quite right, sir. The transition from boy to man is very delicate. That's right. Well, enjoy it. - We're leaving. - Have a good flight. - Thank you. - Be safe. Good-bye. Straight home, Oscar, okay? Alright, son. We're gonna get you a giant sushi roll, okay? - Bravo! - Wonderful! Testing, one, two, three. Can you hear me? Yes. Tanaka! Thank you so much, Mr. Barquett, for your wonderful Italian opera. You beat him up real good. Maybe we can team up for the show? Leave me alone. I don't want to be your friend. Do you want more? Yes or no? Shall we go on with the show? All right. Then come on up, Fito Salinas. If you don't like it, why the fuck are you here? One! Two! Three! Attention! Clean your shoes. We must wear our uniform proudly. We're not a state school. Fix that sissy hairdo. Your collar is all crooked. What's this? Sideburns? I want everybody to get a haircut. It's too long! Israel, would you please open the gate? Yes, sir. Stay in line! There it is! Don't run, boys! Let's take the shortcut. Move, boys. Attention! Who built this path? Ridiculous. What kind of a shortcut is this? All the families of Santa Cruz Otlatla are cordially invited to the town's square. Our friends from Los Pinos secondary school, will be making their yearly donation. Don't be afraid, kids. Keep moving. Come here, I won't hurt you. Know what? I think you're my favorite. You like carrots? Who doesn't like carrots? Edwin... Not funny! That hurt. What are you laughing at? Is this the cutest bunny, or what? Know what? You and I are very much alike. Whenever I see you, I think of myself at your age. I know your path hasn't been easy. I know what it's like to live without love. You're frightening me. You and I haven't made a single decision in our lives. Not one. But today, we have a choice. Cute rabbit. We have all the time in the world. Let's begin with your medicines. No, Edwin, I took them this morning. I have them. How could you have taken them? You gave them to me. I think you're wrong, Diego. Please, don't. Here, take them. Good morning! Thanks for having us. Hand out the boxes, boys. Good morning, everyone. Please hand out the donations. Go, go. Distribute the donations. Good morning. Hand out the gifts. Hand out the donations, please. Go on. They're good clothes, but we fell over on the way, so things got a bit dirty. How are you doing? Here's a bag of clothes for you. Children, say hello. We're glad you're back. Stand up, stand up. Everything alright? Easy. It's alright. Alright, boys, get ready to sing the anthem! Ready! Come on, let's begin. Loud and clear! All we did was go and give them stuff. Hey, Diego. What's up? Is everything alright? Get dressed. We're having a bonfire in a while. Listen up, everybody! Marshmallows! Marshmallows! We've done nine. There's one left. Glory be to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. As it was in the beginning, is now and ever shall be, world without end. Amen. Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy Name. Calm down and continue praying. Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen. Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Keep praying. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners... - It's the mad man. - Now and at the hour of our death. Amen. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. Amen. Glory be to God... - Don't stop. - Continue praying! - Keep praying, children. - Barquett! Barquett, what's that? What's that? Help! Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy Name. Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. - Amen. - Keep praying. Keep praying, children. Can't see anything. To your right. No, more to the left. There's nothing there. - There it is! - Let's go! Follow me, boys, let's get out of here! - We're leaving! - Where are we going? Let's go! Let's go! It's all right. Let's go. Watch your step! Hold on! Stay together! Wait for me! Wait for me! Here we are. You did great this time. Motherfucker! Lolo... do it. The damned beast escaped! Mr. Monteros, it's still on the loose. You're the beast. Damned beast. We're here. Get in and watch your head. Get your head down! Hurry up! Move it! Tanaka, I'm stuck! Keep moving... That's why you can't run anymore. - You're getting old. - Fucking Lolo. Even you got scared, you old devil. Move. Faster. Once more, Lolo. We're calm now, right? - You're not cold, are you? - No. I'm actually hot. - We're alright, aren't we? - Yeah. - Are you sleepy or what? - Yes, it's warm in here. Tanaka, can we call home? You can, Jordi. But think it through, it's late and personally, I think nothing happened, right? What will you tell your folks? That we're all safe, right? It's all under control, boys. What was that? Look, Jordi. Where do you think I got this stone? At the market. At the end of the rainbow. We all have one. Yes, we all have one. These stones come from a nearby river. And believe it or not, once we were boys, just like you. And we came to the Los Pinos integration camp. That was a long, long time ago, though. The hardest moment was during the rally for the flag. - Remember? - Sure, how could we forget? We were playing by the river, when suddenly, a girl came out of the deep woods, crying and screaming. A girl with very long, black hair. Although she was a villager, she was quite beautiful. Am I right? Yes, very beautiful. The girl was calling desperately for help. She said her sister was trapped in a mine. And our little Polish friend here got spooked and fell into the river! I must've fallen on a sharp rock, or a piece of glass. When I stood up, I discovered a deep wound. Blood was gushing out. The girl kept screaming, "If you don't help me, she'll die! The mine caved in, and she's trapped under the rocks! I'll do anything if you help me, please!" And what happened? What happened was that she was really persuasive, but I stood my ground, and told her to wait for us there while we went to get help. By some miracle, we got to the camp, and I told the director about the girl. And he swore on his mother's name that there'd never been a mine in this area. That it was actually a trick local kidnappers used to lure their victims. Young men, that day I learned a very significant lesson. Acting in your own best interests, protecting yourself and your friends is actually the best response to any dilemma. To act selflessly without thinking can have serious consequences. That's our order's best-kept secret. And what does the stone have to do with this? Come on! I think it's a lie. - Oh, Joaquin. - You son of a bitch. Calm down, boys. They're gone. Why didn't they wake us up? Let's go. What time is it? We'll be late for breakfast. Let's go. That way. Come on, I think it's this way. Wait, hold on. I'm starving. May I have some more bread? - And more coffee, please. - Yes, sir. I'm good. Very kind of you. These eggs are my favorite. Please... We apologise. We're sorry we're late. We didn't hear you leave. Well, we're here now. Can we have some breakfast? Oh, Fito. I can't tell you how much it hurts. - You broke my heart. - But... I thought we were friends, but I'm terribly disappointed. Why? After everything we've shared. Somebody stole a chocolate cake last night. A chocolate cake... Silence! Do you think I'm joking? - Do you think it's a game? - No. Maybe a game called "I act like I'm good, "but I actually serve Satan." No? Do you think that's what we teach at Los Pinos? No. Do you think that's what your parents want? No. That you grow up to become thieves and liars? No. No! But, sir, we all slept in the chapel last night. None of us could have stolen the cake. And what cake? It must have been someone who was outside the chapel. The gardeners, or perhaps that satanic man. Or you. - Shut up. - Dude! What was that, young man? We were in the chapel. You weren't. That makes you a suspect, right? - What did you just say? - Sorry. - What did you say? - I'm sorry. Who was it? So you'd rather have water and tortillas for breakfast? You're grounded, for the next four hours you will pray and do penance. - What? - Why? And the cherry on top: the Flag Day rally is cancelled. - What? - No! Why? That's right. The rally's cancelled. To your rooms! Right now! To your rooms. - Off you go. - Please... We were all in the chapel. To your rooms. Joaquin Fuente, you stay. - Me? - Stand here. Gentlemen, let's finish our breakfast. Yes, let's. It's really good. Well, as I was saying, this bread is delicious. It's always been your favourite. I want a taste. Look, Joaquin. I want you to know we're here to help you grow up. We want your seed to grow into a strong tree with solid branches. I know we professors sometimes seem... too strict. And hard to get along with. But I can assure you that in your life you'll run into things that are tougher which you'll need to work out. That's why we're grooming you. Do you think your father would be where he is now if he was a wimp? No. Of course not. I think it's time for you to come clean. Let's talk man to man. Let's walk together. What do you say? It wasn't me. Of course it was you. All your classmates know it. It's not fair. Don't be pathetic! You're so whiny! That's why they reject you. That's why you feel isolated. And I don't like that, obviously. Because it speaks poorly of our order. All I want for this school are strong men. Men with convictions. Men who're not easily intimidated. I want young men with balls! I think you should follow your conscience. And listen to your heart. I think it's time for you to go back to your buddies. Don't be long. - He's always getting us in trouble. - It's his fault. No rally and no breakfast. Because of you we only had tortillas. May I have some paper? - Asshole. - Moron. - May I have some paper? - No. I only came to camp because of the rally. May I have pen and paper? Want some paper? Here. Write "Sinners don't go to heaven" a thousand times. Why did you steal the cake? I didn't! - They're pinning it on me! - Why did you steal it? They blame me, but I didn't do it! Because of you they cancelled the rally. - Sinners go to hell! - It wasn't me! Of course it was you, fucker. It's obvious, Joaquin. Get him! Don't let him go! Grab him! Admit it, asshole! Sinner! Cut off his tongue! Cut it so he can't eat what's not his! Confess! Admit it! Bring me that redheaded rat! - You were never one of us. - No! Don't move, asshole. Just come clean and have done with it. It wasn't me! - Confess! - I didn't do it. - Come clean, you moron. - Confess! You need a new haircut, rat. Do it, Eduardo, and don't think about it. - Do it. - Come on, Eduardo! Do it, Eduardo! Don't hesitate! Please don't! I thought we were friends. You were. Don't hesitate! Do it, fucker, do it! Please... - For fuck's sake! - Do it, asshole! Enough! I did it! Happy now? It was me, alright? Now let me go! Let me go! Wasn't that easy, asshole? You could've spared yourself this, you jerk. Boys! Out, all of you! Right now! - He had it coming. - Nothing to see here. Hold on, man. Let's go together. Hey, Edwin. Where's Diego? Little Diego? He was ill. He's sleeping in the infirmary. Ah, okay. Everybody out! Come on! Come on, boys. Hurry! What are you all gawping at? Our friends the gardeners have a surprise for you. He who is free from sin may have some ice cream. Didn't you hear? Anybody home? It's quite simple. If you think you deserve it, take it. Let's go. Otherwise, don't. And remember our Creator is always watching. Traitor. No pushing. Get in line, and no pushing. Stop pushing me. Make a line. Go get in line. Tanaka, you should tell everybody I stole the cake. And you can send me back home. No need, champ. What counts is having the courage to confess and sacrifice yourself. Good job! We'll fix all those bad habits you brought from outside. Well done. Don't worry. Now go, champ. Don't you want any? I'd say you deserve it. Can I get strawberry and lemon, please? Both? Okay. One lemon and one strawberry. I also want lemon and strawberry. Here you go, son. Thanks. Next one. Smile, kids! It's for Instagram. Gather round, my boys. Smiling and eating ice cream. Nice. It's for Instagram. It's good. It's ice from the Himalayas. From the Everest. - Monteros? - Yes? Does this mean we're playing the flag game? Good question, my boy. What do you say, Tanaka? I'd say it depends. Right, Mr. Monteros? Do you think they really want to play the flag game? Yes, we want to! Please! Alright, we'll play the rally for the flag. Yes! So, boys, teachers, gardeners, everyone get ready! Let the show begin! Thank you! Onward! Only the brave will be rewarded! The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want. He makes me to lie down in green pastures. He leads me beside still waters, and restores my soul. He leads me in the path of righteousness in his name's sake. Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for Thou are with me. Your love and kindness shall follow me all the days of my life. And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever. The Lord my Father loves me tenderly although he wounds me. It's a sign of my divine filiation, for he treats me like a son. Pain will not crush me. Instead, it will purify my intentions. I'll protect myself from all doubt and fear. I will mortify myself for fraternity. I'll follow the way of the cross! Bring me my burning branch! Bring me my arrows! Bring me my spear! Bring me my chariot of fire! Onward! Only the brave will be rewarded! This is the path of the Lord! Amen! Let the battle begin! Mr. Monteros! Excuse me, professor... Edwin, now is not the time. I'm sorry, sir, but... It's not the time. I think it's important! Onward, my precious boys! Edwin! The power and the glory! Forever and ever! My dear boys, remember the peasants are infected. They'll probably die. We can still save their souls if we work together. Don't break the protective ring around the elites. You two, and you, Israel, you're the guardians of our base. When we bring in captives, tie them up with this. - Yes, sir. - Don't let them escape. No, sir. Alright, team. Let's go hunt humans. Spread out. Alright, dogs. Earn your dough! Quick, spread out! Diego! Diego, is that you? Protect the elites! Give it all you've got! Tanaka, where are you going? We have to help him. - No, go get the flag. - We must help him. Go get the flag. Go, go. They spotted us. To prison! Give it your all! Stop them! Let it go, losers! Help! Be grateful I saved your peasant soul! - Let me go! - Shut up! We're saving your soul. Calm down, boys. You're gonna hurt him! Finish tying them up, Eduardo. Let's go for more. Father, what are you doing here? Father. Where is he? What are you talking about? The child with broken bones. It's happened again. Diego! Diego, where are you? Diego! Check him out. What the fuck...? Diego, where are you? Hey, he's right. Where is Diego? Do you think he was kidnapped? Diego Peña is missing. He's missing. We need to comb the entire area. Right now. Let's form groups. Tanaka and Ruco. Sztuhr, Gordillo, and Rosales. Diego! Where's Diego? - What do you mean, where? - Where is Diego? Where is he? Where's Diego? A blond kid, with broken bones. - Where is he? - I have no idea. You don't know either? You don't? Calm down, you spoiled brats! Where's Diego? Where is he? One of your friends has him. Confess, you sinner! - We don't know who he is. - Sure you do! Just confess, son of a bitch! We don't know him. Get your kids out of the village. Get them out. Is that better? Doesn't hurt anymore? - Thank you. - You're welcome. Here. So you can call home and leave. Get out of this hell. - For Diego! - For Diego Peña! Justice! Satan! Burn this town of sinners! It's already going. Let's go. Diego Peña! Burn in hell! Give him back! You'll pay for Diego Peña! We want him back, you fucking thieves! Here! Where's Diego? Where is he? Justice! Diego Peña! Be quiet! - Let me go! - Jordi, they're all leaving! Grab her, you idiot! Diego! Diego! Mr. Tanaka, I'll go ahead. I can cover more ground on my own. Diego! Shut up! - This is your people's fault! - Don't resist! Let me go! - Let me go! - Be quiet! - Stop moving! - Be still! Keep her still, idiots! Do something. Don't you get it, little girl? Don't move! I'll rip your heart out, and I'll eat it with champagne! I'll drag your corpse around the streets of your village. Yes, goddammit! I'm gonna rip your head off. You're fucked! - Smash her skull! - Do it! Kill her, Jordi! - Kill her! - Get out of the way. Go on. You can't do anything right, you jerk! Do it! Here, here! - Come on, Jordi! - Kill her! - Kill her! - Do it! Smash her head in! Let's go. See you around. Here! I'm here! Please! Somebody help me! Please stop! Get me out of here! Here! In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen. Brothers, to celebrate these sacred mysteries with dignity, let us first acknowledge our sins. I confess to Almighty God, and to you, my brothers, that I have greatly sinned in my thoughts, words, in what I've done and failed to do, by my fault, by my fault, by my most grievous fault. Therefore I ask the blessed Virgin Mary, all the angels and saints, and you, my brothers, to pray for me to the Lord our God. Now let us all pray for Diego, who is missing. May he recover his faith and return to us as one of our brothers. Let us now profess our faith. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life, who proceeds from the Father and the Son. The Father and the Son who are worshipped and glorified, who have spoken through the prophets. I believe in one holy Catholic and Apostolic Church. I confess one baptism for the forgiveness of sins, and I look forward to the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come. Amen. The power and the glory! Forever and ever! Look proud! Shoulders back! Move, Edwin. Coming. Good. One more. - Let me check it. - No, enough. Quickly, Edwin. Silence!
