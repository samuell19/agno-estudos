You bang your head against the wall with these shit jobs. I got my plans. Don't you worry. I'm gonna call cousin Louie again in Sorrento About that import business idea of mine. It's a goddamn good idea, Philly. I just didn't do the research. And he didn't understand What kind of business it could be. He understood. He didn't understand it. He understood. He called me after the last time To ask me to tell you to please stop bothering him With the faxes and the phone calls, 'cause he's not interested In opening up an American store already. I didn't have to, of course, 'cause like all your other plans, The minute it doesn't happen overnight, You lose interest anyway. And all the while, you could... Be working with me, you know? I'm not a bartender. I know. You're--you're an elevator operator. Gypsy cabdriver. Now you sell hot watches on the street. You're not anything. Phil... I've been dying a slow death Since the day my wife threw me out. A woman walks into my elevator, And she sees me, Phil. She sees me, And I think maybe something else Can happen for me. Why? I don't know. I don't care. But this can't be my life. This can't! Now, you want to give me the money, Phil--fine. You don't... I got to be 00. Hi. Hi. I hope i'm not interrupting. Oh, no, no, no.

Why'd you split up? She threw me out. Kind of took the fun out of the marriage for me. No, no, we weren't, uh... We weren't getting along for quite a while. I would always try to do right by her, But I always did it the wrong way. And then after a while, She would just wait for me to fuck up, Which I always did. What were you trying to do? Well, I always wanted my own business. Not my father's or my brother's, but mine. And I have this cousin in Italy Who's got this olive oil-tomato business, And I wanted to sell his stuff here. You know, import. And then, after a while, Expand to, like, cheeses and pasta and... It's a terrific idea. New Yorkers will pay anything If you tell them it's imported. Yeah. My brother says that my cousin's not interested. So go to Italy and change his mind. It's a very good idea. Yeah. Why did that prick bastard husband ever leave you? Another woman, younger. Pediatrician. Did you know that, uh, he shopped around? That he was--16 years you were together. You must have known something was going on. Why? Why should i have been expected To look over my shoulder all of the time? He lied. He lied about... Not wanting children. He lied about... Loving our life. He lied about loving me. What's the difference if I knew or not? He still would have left. He wanted someone younger. You're right. He's a prick. The guy's a prick. Men are pricks. We're all pricks. No. We--we act like we know it all, You know, and we got it all together, But we don't know what's going on half the time. I mean, we're scared to death. Of what? Not finding it. Finding what? I--i don't know. Uh... Our place, maybe. Mm-hmm. I...i mean, I've had moments. Uh, times when I love my wife, And I knew that there was no other place That I should be. But, uh...

Look, we'll talk again later. But if you're still offering...uh, ok. Ok what the hell are you talking about? Ok, I mean ok. Ok to you paying my debts, But i'm gonna only work part-time in the bar. And I have a few conditions. A few what? Conditions. This is amateur night at Jasper's Where you get to take all that rehearsin' You've been doin' in the shower And show us what you got. One margarita. Uh, it's, uh... It's the only way I can keep track. Liz: It's his first night here, so please give him a big hand. All right! * missed the Saturday dance * * heard they crowded the floor * * couldn't bear it without you * * don't get around much anymore * * thought i'd visit the club * Judith: Oh, oh God. * got as far as the door * You are painful. I mean, if you're going to go after a dream, Pick the right one. * don't get around much anymore * I'm sure you're a nice person, But face the music. * Darling, I guess * Can you even hear the music? Excuse me. The manager's sorry, but we have to ask you to leave. * get around much anymore * But she's awful. * dum duh dee dee * * been invited on dates * You gonna be sick? What? What is the point of what you're doing? Excuse me? In here. Fixing your makeup. He's going to dump you eventually For someone younger, so what is the point? I mean, you're a nice-looking woman. Why does everything have to be about men? Excuse me. Oops. You need some coffee. You know, I once heard you sing, And I complimented you, and you completely ignored me. I'm sorry. That was rude. Yes, it was. But you're a terrific singer. Maybe people with talent are allowed to be rude. How come you only made one record? 'cause nobody bought that one. I did. Do you need some help getting home? I'm fine. Don't you, uh... Have to go back and do the amateur thing? No. My boss cut it short tonight. Sorry. I don't mind. Although, my boyfriend is waiting for me, So if you're gonna be ok in here-- He's gay. What? Your friend. You don't even know who i'm talking about. Yeah, I do. That young guy with the beautiful... Voice. I saw you looking at him when he sang. I saw your expression. I...i know that look. I don't know how you can know that. When you're laying in the gutter, You can see underneath people A little better than usual. You don't look like the gutter type. Oh, i'm a native. I just clean up well. That's from living on the Upper Eastside For 20 years. I learned how to let doormen carry my bags. I learned how to order wine And cater parties. I dumped all my friends from home because their... Husbands didn't make as much as mine. And it was difficult to do things with them, Things they couldn't afford. Ha. Feels good to admit that finally. Funny what you can tell a stranger And you can't tell people you know. I've told so many stories all my life. I'm so tired of telling stories. Hmm. He left you? I don't know who he left. I'm not sure where I've been for 20 years. I knew deep down he saw other women. I knew for years. I just kept thinking... He must know I know. That's why he stays. Because I let him do what he wants. Because... I understand what he needs, And I don't make it difficult. He'll never leave. Why should he? He can do whatever he wants. As long as he stays. There are all kinds of marriages. At least i'm married. At least i'm safe. It's amazing. Isn't it? The things you find yourself agreeing to? Then... Some guy with great hands Kisses me In a dark room, And i'm saved. This is why it all happened. This will be my new story. How I met my second husband. Where'd you go to, a party? Yeah. Mmm. You know, um... After we spoke, I talked to my brother. I called him, and I made a deal with him. I, uh, you know, I figured what the heck. Maybe if I work for him part-time or something-- Look... What? It's late. What's the matter? Nothing. I'm just... Not in the mood tonight. What the hell's wrong with you? Hi. Judy? Where would you like me to set up? Uh... Living room? Sounds good. Can I get you anything? A drink? A glass of water would be great. Thanks. Sorry i'm a little late. The cabs, they see this table, And they pass right by me. Ok if i move these? Sure. Here. Oh, thanks. So, how long has it been Since you've had a massage? I... Don't remember. Yikes. That's no good. I brought my own towels, But if you prefer yours... Oh. Yeah. Beautiful. I also brought my own music, But, again, if you prefer your own... Uh, this is fine. So... Where'd you see my ad? Um... Some--some New York magazine. Hmm. Ok. Well, you want the hour or hour and a half? Can I decide later? Sure. Usually, no, but, uh... I have no clients after you, So you're in luck. You may want to take off your jewelry. Now, this is, uh... Totally for you, so... However far you want me to go or not go, It's entirely up to you. I've been doing this for 3 years. I can give all kinds of massage. What Well, Swedish, Shiatsu, deep tissue, Erotic... Or any combo. It's your choice. They're entirely safe. Is there any, um... Specific areas you'd like me to concentrate on? On me? No. Would you like me to take these off? Can I decide later? Sure. I just have to go wash my hands, So just make yourself comfortable. We're going to start on your stomach, So place the towel over you, And i'll be right back. Your bathroom? Over this way. Well... Let's get you warmed up here. I just want you to know... That I will not do anything You don't want me to do. * at last * This is all about pleasure, About touch. * my love * * has come along * Bodies touching. Just let everything go. And if you want to touch me, Feel free. * and life is like a song * People are so scared nowadays. They forget how good it is to be touched. * yeah, yeah, yeah * It's important. There you go. * the skies above * Just let it go. * are blue * That's right.

Hi. Good massage? Mm-hmm. He was a good-looking guy. You use him before? No, first time. That's a good job. If you don't mind my asking, What does a guy get for a 2 1/2 hour massage? Ahem. Look, I want to apologize. I--i was a little, uh, Abrupt before. I'm sorry. You want some coffee? Yeah. Yeah. Mmm. There's something that I want to get off my chest. Ahem. It's been bugging me. It's about the first night that we talked-- The night I borrowed the money from you. Oh, no, no, no. You don't have to. No, no, I want to. I want to come clean about something. About not needing the money for the gas guy? You knew? Pat... A $189 gas bill for a Fifth Avenue co Hmm. So why'd you give it to me? I don't know. Mmm, I figured you were good for it. Hmm. There's something else I wanted to ask you. Um... I was wondering if one night-- Uh... This is-- Jesus, this is tough. I'm--i'm really a little rusty at this. Pat, don't. What? Don't, uh... I don't want to hurt your feelings. Hurt my feelings about what? I think I know what you're going to ask. You do? Mmm. Mmm. And i'd rather you didn't. Oh. Oh. See, I just wanted to know If you wanted to have dinner with me sometime, Maybe go out to a movie. Pat, I just asked you not to ask me. Oh, you were right? Yeah. Well, I thought maybe you could've been Completely off the mark. No. So you knew what I was going to... Is that a no? Look, i--i--i-- I think you're a wonderful person, But I think that... That I like you? Yes. And i-- I think I know what you want. Yeah? So? I think you're a terrific person, too. I--i like being with you. I'd like to, you know, see you more-- Take you out, spend some time with you. But that's not possible. Why? Because of what I do? No. Are you sure? Look, you're not being honest. It's not just about spending time with me. You feel comfortable with me, right? We have a good time when we're talking-- Nice time telling jokes or kidding around, right? Yes, but I don't want you thinking It can be anything more than that. Well, it's none of your business What I think or what I want. I mean, you can't control that. Well, it just won't happen. How do you know it won't? I know. How can you know? I mean, you can't know a thing like that. I'm not attracted to you that way. So maybe it'll change.it won't. How do you know that? I know. I want to feel my life. I want to be authentic. I want to stop agreeing to things I don't really want. Then stop. Look, Judith, i'm not asking you to marry me. I'm just saying let's spend a little time together. Whatever happens, doesn't happen, it doesn't matter. Of course it's going to matter. If you want to sleep with me, and I don't, It's going to matter. No, believe me, it won't matter. So if I want to just be friends That's what we'll be? Yes. Unless it changes. I don't think it will. Well, you never know. How can you know? You don't know. Things change. I--i might lose interest. I mean, it's not a great possibility That I might lose interest, but... Come on. Come on. Come on, what? What? We're laughing here. We're having a good time. I don't want this. Then why'd you come down here? To apologize. Oh, you came down here to apologize, is that it? Is that authentically why you came down here? No. I came down here because... I can't sleep... And because I don't want to be alone. Pat: Sorry. The lady upstairs-- Did you hear the bell? Yeah, I heard the bell, but-- Doesn't anybody work anymore? Yeah, we work. The lady was moving a refrigerator. Writing the great American novel up there. Fell over on a cat. We had...

Because, really, I swear, you make me cry. Oh, thank you. Thank you so much. Because you know why? Because when you sing, It's not about just you. It's not about now. It's the whole black experience, You know what i'm saying? Because, you see, black people-- African-American people-- When they sing sentimental songs, They're not sentimental, right? You know why? Why? Because they have the pain to back it up. Yes. I have the pain. It's i'm full the pain. of pain. You are absolutely right. You know what? Thank you so much. You're welcome. Thank you. You are so great. You're so great. You bring your friends next time. Keep on singing. Keep on singing, now. I got plenty of bad times to sing about, Don't you worry. Ok. You get home safe. I will. This is your fault. This is her fault. Why? Because you said I was rude. Every since you said I was rude, It's like I got to talk to every psycho That comes in the place just so I don't feel bad. Hey, there he is. Hi, gary. How you doing? Nice to see you again. And this is Pat. Hi. Nice to meet you. Mmm. Mmm. So, you want a drink? Sure. Please. So, how was your audition?

You may not want to try it on your first time. Really? But, I mean, it's just fun to watch. 00. We going to go. We're going. Ok. And she gave me these. What do they do? She says It just makes you feel free, And it makes you want to just touch everybody. And for one night, It makes you forget all the ex-husbands And gay boyfriends You can think of. You going to be all right? Look... It's my own fault. It's not like I lie to myself. I just love him. I don't know. You know what it is? It's like i've always had this thing For beautiful, Gentle men. You know? It's like they have sort of a--a kindness I never found in other men, And I like that. And they're sensitive, too. You know, it's like having a guy And a girlfriend at the same time. Of course, being that sensitive, They feel things that regular guys don't-- Like the need to suck dick. So, you know... You take the good with the bad. Ooh. Well. Where are you going? Liz invited me to this after-hours place downtown Called... Confession...al. It's somewhere in the meat district.

He's--he's a terrific guy-- A real character-- Lived in the same house For over 60 years. Wow. Wow. And his family were... They were one of the original town settlers. Uh... Anyway, uh, He's a terrific guy, And, um... There are also 2 plumbers in town. Again, the one that I use is, uh... Kei-- What is your problem? I thought we were going to be civilized. I--i have to apologize for this. You are such a child. I can't believe you're behaving like this. Lawyer: You all right, Bob Hey, what are you-- I want to say something. You're out of your mind. Do you know that? Can we please-- Shut up. Shut up. I want you to know I don't hate you. Man: I DON'T BELIEVE THIS. I--i want to get on with my life, And I can't do it hating you.

I'm over you, believe me. What? You stupid... Asshole. That's all you're going to say? What do you want me to say For what? I fell in love. I feel something. For the first time, my heart is open. I'm learning how to give love And receive love From someone who knows how, finally! And i'm supposed to be sorry? I never said I didn't love you! Just because it fell apart Doesn't mean it wasn't love at some point! Uhh! I am through! God, what was it? What was I so scared of That you were a better choice? Uhh! Help! I mean, this situation Clearly called for me to attack him. He takes everything so damn seriously. So he's going to press charges? It depends. His lawyer said he'd forget the whole thing If I forfeited my share of money from the house. That is bullshit. That's what I said, But then... They explained how Assault and battery carries a 30-day sentence And a fine. And it would be on my record, And... I mean, you-- No. My credit cards are, like... Aw, look, you're really upset now. Let me-- Don't think about it, ok? I'm off tonight. Take a nice rest And let me take you out to dinner. Ok? We'll get dressed up real nice.

Yes, yes. Congratulations. Thank you very much. Mmm. Hmm? We leave on November 3rd. What? Now, don't--you don't have to decide right now. Pat... I can't go to-- to Italy. It's 6 weeks away.

Lot of things you have to do. That's just it. I... I wanna know... What i'm supposed to be doing, What i'm really meant to do. And i...
