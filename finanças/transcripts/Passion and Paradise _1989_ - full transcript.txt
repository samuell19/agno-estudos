(Multicom Jingle) (crowd talking) (engine roaring) - [Worker] Okay, okay let's go now. (soft music) (engine roaring) - You look like you're lost son. - Is this the way to East Bay? - East Bay you go five miles and a half more down the road. But it's all mud. - I'm not lost. (footsteps sloshing) (soft music) (birds chirping) (jazzy music) (water splashing) - What do you want to do this evening? Go to the club? - Let's do something different, like take a midnight swim. - You should wait until after we're married for that sort of thing. People are talking, eh. - Who says we're getting married? - I thought we had an understanding? After all, your mother approves. - Then I suggest you marry my mother. (water splashing) (jazzy music) I wish Dennis could be a bit more romantic. - He doesn't have to be romantic darling. He's going to inherit all those lovely castles in Scotland. - I know, but I'm so tired of him being such a gentleman. - Would you rather be in that dreary old boarding school? - Or in London having bombs dropped on you or in paradise? - Paradise is a bore. (logs cracking) (engine roaring) - [Homeowner] Who is that? Mr. Christie. Mr. Christie, I didn't expect you to show up out here. - My dear fellow, I always welcome my clients into their new homes. - Well. - What do you think? A bit of a mess, isn't it? - Naw, must've been a fine farm in its day. (engine blaring) - You'll have it back on its feet in no time. Curtis has already found some good boys for you. - Look a this, this is wonderful. (crowd talking) - Now, let me know if there's anything else I can do. I think you'll find that you've bought a nice little place. - I tell ya, I'm beginning to see there's nothing little about 3,000 dwellers a month, huh? - (laughter) You can't be serious. - [Homeowner] Why? - Well we don't have a big enough market new diners. - Oh no, I mean about the war. You know there'll be thousands of troops out here. They'll be training here in the next few months. Somebody's got to feed those boys, right? - You're gonna have to share those contracts with other farmers. - Didn't really expect to share anything here with anyone. - My dear fellow, I sell real estate nine to five, but you better learn to play by the rules. We have a gentleman's agreement about the way we do business in these islands. (engine roars) - Then again if I make enough money I suppose the whole world will call me gentleman, right? - [Curtis] Make sure they got enough feed. - [Worker] Yes sir, yes sir. - [Curtis] Make sure they have enough, okay? So what did he say? Everything okay here Curtis? Well we're two men short. - If you want to hire, we'll go with two okay. - I'll tell you what, from now on let's just hire as many as we need and we'll just pay them whatever the going rate is. - [Curtis] Okay I'll pick them up on my next trip. - How bad is it in here? - Bahamas in two countries. Rich and poor. Some folks say (mumbles). (chickens clucking) - I don't want no trouble here, ya know? - Maybe not such a good time for strangers to be buying land. (laughter) - Well this is my land now buddy. And I am not going anywhere. (motor roaring) - You won't make any money from selling chickens kid. You won't last long. - Well, I'll just keep going the way I'm going. Some day I oughta have the biggest farm here in the Bahamas. - (giggles) You think pretty much of yourself, don't ya? - I'll tell you, I think pretty much of this machine you're sitting on here. You think your boss will let me use this to clear a little land down there? - My boss? I don't know. I'll tell you what we'll do. You jump in the back, I'll take you up to the shack, and we'll have a little snort. - Maybe later. - Ain't no business gonna go on here while you're gone. No work at all. - Aye, what's going on here? - The last law, brought the British influence, it's called G time. - What? - G time! - Oh, oh. You're on. - [Farmer] Hop up. (motor blaring) (Multicom Jingle) - [Homeowner] This is unbelievable. - [Farmer] Yeah, it's big isn't it? - [Homeowner] You'd have to be an egomaniac to live in a place like this. (Multicom Jingle) - Welcome home, another day? - Yeah, pretty good. Planted five more trees, at this rate I'll have the whole river embankment planted. It's gold son. - Who is that? - Why sir, that's Sir Harry Oakes. - That's the richest man in the world? - [Butler] Yes. And you sir, are just in time for tea. (soft music) - Holy smokes. (horses gallop) - Too fast. (horses nay) - Hello darling, you're late. - Well Dennis insisted on a jump in the creek, twice. He's such a show off. (laughter) - I enjoy watching you two ride together. It's splendid. - Oh well I hope you don't think it looks splendid as walking up the aisle together. - Ah, well I was rather hoping you'd come to a decision soon. - Hello Charlie, bar is open. - I don't love him mother. - Life doesn't always give us love at exactly the moment you want it. It's something that develops over a period of time. - I don't believe that. That's not how it happened with you and dad. - Hello. That's hardly the point. Dennis is going to get his commission by the end of the summer. The Royal Navy is not going to wait for you to make up your mind. - My poor mother, I spoiled your wonderful plans for the wedding, haven't I? Maybe you should take me back where daughters come from and get a refund. - It's very funny. Just remember my friend, summer isn't going to last forever. (pat lightly) - Haa. (water falling) - [Harry] I think it's good form to show your respects to the governor, he likes that. - Thank you, I understand. A chicken farmer at the Empire Day Ball with all those famous gentlemen. - Ah you'll be able to hold your own. Now, Christy tells you're some kind of a Count. - No, no my family inherited this french title. I don't use it. - But I'm still gonna get you an invitation. - That's not necessary. - No, I want to do it. You make the right connections, you can go a long way on the island. - Listen I have no intentions of not going a long way now. - Ah, here she comes. Here comes the lady of the house! We're going home to the next door neighbors. - Hello. - Hello, Count de Marigny, you're welcome indeed. - Well, thank you. You have to forgive my appearance. I didn't know who was sitting on that tractor. (laughter) - Don't mind Harry, he likes to keep us all off balance. - Well, I was just taking your measure before you start to suck up to me. - Yeah, I'mma have to restrain myself (laughter). - Will you go get yourself cleaned up? - Okay, mama. Well you're quite a surprise. We were expecting a grizzled old recluse with birdseed in his pockets. - That's me. - Hardly. Well, if you'll excuse me. - Sure. (footsteps tapping) (soft music) (instrumental music) - [Guest] Who's that? - That smooth looking chap over there, the Count. - That all sounds interesting. - Hardly, chicken farmer. - Wait, what are you doing here? - Harry, how are you? - Good to see ya. I never saw you dressed up before. You're all clean and neat, you look like a boy scout. (laughter) Come on, what do you think of the party? - Beautiful. - It reminds me of a bordello I used to go to in the Klondike only it was a better class of people there. - (laughter) You're amazing. - Why? - How did you get into this? - Gold. - Come on, you went from being a prospector to being a baronet of the British Empire? - Let me tell you a secret, the little gold nuggets can buy you anything in the world. Now come on, I want to introduce you to somebody. Your Highness, this is my friend, oh Duchess, I'm sorry. This is Alfred de Marigny. - So you're the fellow who stole that army contract from our farmers? - Well, you look more like a thief of hearts than a thief of chickens, Count? - No, I'm no thief at all Duchess. - [Duchess] No? - Anybody can bid on a contract. I guess I was the only one that bothered. - Well, that'll teach our gentlemen farmers not to be so damn complacent. - Bit of an initiative, eh? You come from where? - [Alfred] New York. - What was it you said you did there? - I don't think I did say anything (laughter). I was an investment broker. - And before that? - Do you always interrogate people at the Empire Day Ball, your Royal Highness? - Only if they attempt to deceive me. - Ah, I think we have to go now. Excuse us your Highness and Duchess. - You are watching the fountain of youth of the Caribbean my friends. Here it is before your very eyes. Prepare the next bottle. We're getting low, watch it. Get ready for the next bottle. Here we go, take empty bottles. Switch bottle. (crowd cheers) Next bottle, go! (crowd cheers) (soft music) - It's not polite for a gentleman to stare at a lady. - Well, I apologize. I'm not much of a gentleman, but I'll try to do better. Alfred de Marigny at your service. - Nancy Oakes. I don't think I've seen you around here before Mr. de Marigny. - Probably 'cause you don't go down to those chicken coops too often, so. - Oh, so you're the one that bought the old place on East Bay. - And you're wondering what I'm doing here. It's true, I have absolutely no right to be here. - So you're a party crasher? - Oh no, your father managed an invitation, but I was afraid to come. Kind of glad I did. (giggles) - Dad does like to stir things up. - Well listen, here is to stirring things up. (glasses click) (soft music) Is that true? - What? - A gold mine, he actually owns a gold mine? - (giggles) Well it does keep us in the pennies. And dad's managed to donate some of it for the development of the Bahamas. - Pennies, I like that, yeah. Well his donations certainly seemed to have bought him half these islands, huh? - That's rather cynical. You obviously don't know my father. - Oh, I know money and know the boss. - For your information my father is the most generous man alive. He's built us swamps, he built a hospital, he set up a bus system for workers, free milk for the children. - I didn't realize all this, I'm very sorry. - You certainly are, very sorry indeed. (crowd talking) (footsteps tapping) - Bet he is. (soft music) - I just don't like, de Marigny sniffing around Nancy. He's an old chicken farmer. - Well, he certainly don't fit the part. But he's tough, he's got a way with him. (laughter) - What do you know about hustlers? You're a prospector, you've been a prospector all your life. You think you're tough? You're an innocent. - You really think you know me so well? - From the minute you walked into that bank 20 years ago, I knew you. (kiss smacks) I said to myself, God there's a man. But he won't be interested in me. I am just a secretary. - Oh, oh little poor baby, oh. (laughter) Let me tell you what I thought. I walked in the bank and I saw you sitting behind your desk. And I said to myself, oh Lord. And then I said, well she never gonna look at me. And then, you turned your head and you looked at me and you smiled. And it was like all the rainbows in the world came out at once. - [Announcer] This just in from our wire service. The most beautiful ocean liner in the world, The Normandy is ablaze at her New York pier. (sirens blaring) (upbeat music) [Announcer] A terrible explosion sent fire storms sweeping through the ship as it lay at anchor in its West 48th Street dock. Scores are firemen are struggling heroically against the inferno of flames and smoke. Casualties are mounting by the hour. Nazi sabotage is suspected. (keys clanking) - He said, "Don't call him Lucky." He doesn't like strangers to call him Lucky. - Morning Charles, this is Lieutenant Haffenden from Navy Intelligence. He's here to talk to you in a matter of national security. (keys clanking) (prisoners yelling) - Cigarette? - What's this all about? Ha. - The Bahamas. - Yeah, it seems I'll take a little trip maybe ocean cruise. What do ya think? - Too bad you can't take a trip on the Normandy. - Yeah, that ship that caught fire. I heard about that. - It was sabotage, we were getting ready to convert her to a troop ship. - What's that got to do with me? - We'd like you to help us track down German agents operating in the ship yards. - Want me to play the G man? Why would I want to do that? - Forgive me for being direct Mr. Luciano, but you were one of the top men in the, well in your organization. You still call the shots on the waterfront. - In case you ain't notice kid. I'm on vacation here, 30 to 50 courtesy of the state of New York. - Yeah, well maybe I can do something about that. - Did you read about the Normandy? Next thing you know the Germans'll be landing saba tourism. We better beef up the island's defenses. - Churchill seems to believe we can defend ourselves on a few officially from the British Treasury I'm also mine to get a decent living allowance. - Well you better tell her to stop sending those fancy hairdressers down from New York. - Dammit Harry, think how it looks. Former King of England chained to this island like a dog. - You got a pretty fancy kennel. - All the policy restrictions make it impossible for us to travel to New York, Mexico City. Churchill's got me on a bloody tight leave. - Well that leave will get a lot looser once our friend gets here. (soft music) - Dismiss! (whistle blowing) (feet pounding) - Sir, our estimated time of arrival to Bahamas is 24 hours. - Thank you. Wire Sir Harry. - Yes, sir. (instrumental music) (upbeat Caribbean music) (crowd talking) - I like the green one, kind of go with your hair. - You again. - I didn't mean to offend you. - You insulted my father. - Okay, but it's the last thing in the world I meant to do. I just want to apologize. - Accepted. - It's something else I wanted to say to you. - Maybe you should stop while you're ahead. - Well, I wouldn't be able to tell you what a beautiful woman I think you are. - You do apologize nicely. - Good, I mean at least we can be friends. Oh. Listen, suppose we discuss in terms of the peace agreement. - You don't waste any time do you? - When you know what you want, why waste it? - Well I'm sorry, but I don't care to be picked up like a waterfront floozie. - I understand. - But if you happen to pass by the Lion's Jaw tonight. It's all the excitement there is in this town. You may see me there. (crowd talking) (upbeat Caribbean music) (Caribbean drums) (crowd talking) (audience applause) (audience laughter) (audience applause) - Come on girls the chef's gonna show us how to make zombie powder. - Frogs, blood and sawdust, I'll stick to lemonade thank you. - All right, come on, we're off the see the wizard. (playful singing) (footsteps tapping) - Hello Count, we've all been trying to figure you out. - Really, what's the consensus of opinion? - If you're a Nazi spy or escaped convict of Devil's Island. - What do you think? - I think a lady broke your heart. It's the romantic in me. - I think this is our dance. (soft music) You're certainly one very beautiful woman. Has anyone ever told you that? - You did this morning. We were talking about you. - I'd much rather talk about you, but since you're pressing me, I can only begin with being born. You don't think it's remarkable how many great men has actually begun their lives, beautiful? (laughter) - [Nancy] Are you really a Count? - [Alfred] Oh, this for the company, I bleed blue, I do. (giggles) - Come on Nancy, we're pushing on to the opera. - Oh, do you know that reminds me, I've been meaning to join this club. It's just for the boat. - I'm afraid that's impossible, old sport. No room for the chickens. (laughter) - Don't you think I should join though, if I'm gonna win the World Cup? - Ha, ha you win the cup? You know I can't make out whether you're a bloody old man, you're just a simpleton. - I'm sure you'll come up with something. - Come on, I said we were leaving. - I'll catch up with you later, Dennis. (crowd talking) (footsteps tapping) (engine roaring) - Some poor native has a voodoo curse on him. When the drums stop he dies. (soft music) I see you saved something for moonlight. - Why don't I pick you up for lunch tomorrow? - I can't. A business associate of my father's is having a private party. I'm expected to attend. (soft music) Why don't you come too, as my guest? - I just think, I let your father talk me into one party too many, thanks. - Can never attend too many parties. If you want to see me again, the house is called White Spring. Meet me there at one o'clock. (soft music) (door slams) (footsteps tapping) - Just about now you're gonna turn around for that one last look too. Oh boy. Oh boy. (soft music) (footsteps tapping) - [Man] If feel we can always talk man to man. - [Harry] How about the Jews, can you talk to Adolph about the Jews? - I suspect that Zionist propaganda. Keep your Americans in the war. The Germans are basically a decent people. - You talk me into him. When are you gonna invite Adolf to tea. - I wish you were a king old man. You could repeal those blasted currency regulations. - They need to tell me. I can barely keep my Canadian ranch afloat. (balls clanking) I've gotta find some new income from somewhere. - The best investment is right here, in land, but we've got to let the people get money in and out. Look at me, I'm stuck with thousands of acres that I can't sell. - What are you trying to do? You trying to buy up the whole island? - I'd buy the Caribbean if I could. There's gonna be a tourist boom here after the war. - Good the damn tourists. - Look there's nothing wrong with building up hotels Harry. Liven the place up, now isn't it? - Look we have a tropical Eden here under God's sunshine and I'm damned if I'm gonna let a bunch of sloppy tourists ruin it. Goodnight your Highness. (footsteps tapping) - Whoo. (door slams) (soft music) (knocking hard) (door slams) - Hi. - Hi, just came up to wish you goodnight. - [Nancy] Okay. - So tell me, did you have a good time? - The usual. I met our new neighbor. He drove me home. - Well, I don't know if I like that. - I thought you liked him. - Well no, I mean it's different for me, I'm a guy, but I mean a nice young lady don't jump in a car of a stranger. - It's a truck actually, we went dancing. - Dancing? - Are we gonna argue about this? - We're not gonna argue about it. I just care what happens to you. - I know you do but he's a perfectly nice man. - He's twice as old as you are. - Can we drop this please? - Okay. - [Nancy] Goodnight dad. - Goodnight. (soft music) (door closes) (water splashes) (ominous music) (rotor clanking) (crashing loudly) - Cheers and death to petty regulations everywhere. - Well, you better save your toast until you get to Mexico. - My dear Harry, the good Lord watches over all us men of vision and enterprise. - Yeah, well the good Lord doesn't have to dodge the U.S. Coast Guard and the Royal Navy, Axel. (orchestral music) - Didn't know if you'd come. - You know. - Yeah, I knew. (crowd talking) - [Royal Highness] This is getting more dangerous every time. - Ah, your Royal Highness, just think of all the dollar you will have. You will be able to travel freely. You can invest at wartime prices which are low. It is perfectly safe. - What it is dear heart is illegal for me to transfer my money out of a British colony at wartime. - You think you're the only one taking risk? That's my gold out there floating on Axel's boat. - de Marigny! You're turning up all over the place these days. - Yes, invitations do seem to come my way, don't they? Courtesy of the Oakes family, of course. - I invited Mr. de Marigny. - That's great Nancy, it's just great. - Harry tells me you don't use your title. May I ask, why not? - I guess your Royal Highness, I've just come to believe a man's honor and his good name are all he needs. - I would've vote a gentlemen would take more pride in heritage. One doesn't just give up one's title. - Hmm, but then with respect your Highness, why did you give up the throne of England? - So glad you said, with respect. (laughter) - Excuse us. - Wow. - You oughta learn a few manners, you know? - Are you kidding? A little man like that with a big title. - Sorry. (footsteps tapping) (doors clanking) - Charlie. Charlie! (laughter) (tapping lightly) - How come all this? - The Feds are great. (door slams) We're spy busters Charlie. Our boy tricks on the dock yards. They're going out for espionage. I may even get you into Great Meadows penthouse suite. - I'd rather have parole. - One thing at a time. We got a small piece of the action and some gas stations. - Gas stations, that's pathetic. - Things they ain't what they used to be. - What the hell is happening to us? Capone's dying of syphilis, and Nitti shot himself, all the bosses are dead, deported or behind bars. Mussolini is killing all the old families in Sicily. (mumbles) - Not in Cuba. Now we got Baptiste. He's stupid, he's legitimate and we own him. - Godfrey Baptiste is a pig. The Cuban's are gonna cut off his head one of these days. (utensils clacking) Pickles! (laughter) - So we look around, something new maybe? - The Bahamas, they got a law against gambling down there. - Even better. When you got something that other people want, but they can't get, alls you do is supply the demand, shovel in the dark. - That's his law. (laughter) So who do we buy? The Duke of Windsor? - That clown. Naw, naw. The real muscle down there is a guy named Harry Oakes. - Harry Oakes. (soft music) - They actually let you park this old wreck here? - Well, it's more like an ugly duckling right now than a swan, but she happens to be a bargain. I paid only 300 pounds for this. - Really? Well, she does have nice lines. - Yeah, wait 'til I finish refitting her. She'll be one smooth sailor. You care to scrub the deck? (people talking) (soft music) - Nancy seems quite taken with the Count de Marigny, doesn't she? - Oh, she's a big girl. - Did you say de Marigny? - Do you know him Sophie? - Ah, every woman in Manhattan knows the Count. He's positively notorious. What ever is he doing here? (soft music) - What do you mean? - Yes, he seems like such a nice fellow. - [Man] He is. - [Sophie] He's the king of jigalows darling. He has a million dollar smile and he only smiles for women with a million dollars. (soft music) (laughter) - Don't be fooled by him. The Duchess and her friends know Alfred. He's a dangerous man. - The Duchess and her friends are vindictive snobs. - Maybe so, but I still don't trust the Count. - What about me? Do you trust me? - Of course we do, that's not the point. - Stop telling me who I can see and who I can't see. - Do you care what people think? - No, it's not my responsibility what people think. Only what I am, didn't you teach me that? - I guess we did. - I don't want you seeing him. - Is that an order? - Yes, it is. I didn't raise you to throw yourself at a man like that. - What you raise me for? To marry Dennis or another chinless wonder like that? - Come on, I don't want you talking to your mother like that. - I'm sorry, but I don't tell you who to see. It's about time you realize I can look after myself. (footsteps tapping) - It's gonna break her heart. (upbeat music) (water splashes) (instrumental music) (waves crashes) (laughter) - Your parents agreee with me? - Uh huh? - What do they think? - They think you want me for my money (laughter). - The Duchess told them you were some kind of playboy. - Well, the Duchess is right. I used to have a reputation in New York. They came in public relations for a firm I worked for. Used to handle money for rather important clients. - A few rich widows? (soft music) - Yeah, a few. I was the one. I mean I took them to dinner. Got their names from the society columns. Very boring stuff. - So that's it? - That's it? - I don't believe it. - I can't blame you. (laughter) - No, I believe you, that's what I don't believe. - I'm here, 'cause I'm interested in you. You know I care about you. I don't care about your money. (screams loudly) (laughter) - You make me feel wonderful. - Yeah, well how wonderful is wonderful? (water splashes) (motor revs) (ominous music) - Thank you taking your time during your recess like this Mr. Adderley. I appreciate this. - Nonsense, nonsense. Sit down. - Thank you. - Now, how can I help you? - Well, this may seem sort of irregular by the way, actually I'm here because of my chickens. - I am sorry, I don't-- - Forgive me, I'm sorry. My chickens, they were butchered this morning. - Oh you wish to initiate legal proceedings? - No, no, not here for any legal representation at all. Not pressing charges or anything, I just-- - I'm afraid you have me baffled Mr. de Marigny, I'm a barrister not an agriculturalist. - Oh, I know, I know. People say you're the best barrister down here, by the way. They say some very lovely things about you. They also tell me you're the one person who understands the racial situation here from both sides and I'll tell you. I'm living here now and I just want to raise my chickens in peace and want to get along with everybody. I just thought you might have some ideas. (laughter) What's so funny? - You're the first. - What's that? - Most white landowners higher a private army of bully boys with shotguns. - Yeah, see I got to make a home here. I don't want to fight or go to war. (crowd talking) - I love this time of year. Should have seen me 20 years ago, wild parties, smuggling voodoo dolls. - Oh rum running? Prohibition must've been so interesting. - It was an exciting time. You may not believe me looking at me now, but I was young then. A search for adventure. - Somehow I find it hard to picture you trying to out run the coast guard with a tommy gun under your arm. (laughter) - I probably would've fainted at the noise, but I'm not done yet no, no. Gotta indulge something you believe in. And before I'm through this is all going to be gone. Probably a grand hotel. I'm gonna turn this second rate colonial outpost into one of the most luxurious resorts in the entire world. - Dad might have something to say about that. - He'll come around, he has to. Progress. So to tell me, you still going at it like cats and dogs? - Yes, mother too. - Hmm, you really like de Marigny. - Yeah I do. He's different, you know. There's something special about him. - It scares you? (laughter) - Maybe a little. I just feel so close to him. - You're not afraid of him, you're afraid of yourself. I may just seem like your boring old godfather, but I know a thing or two about men. - I know that. I fell in love with you when I was three. (kiss smacks) - Wise idea. (laughter) (banging loudly) - Dr. Gordon? I really appreciate you coming out here. Mr. Adderley suggested we meet. I had no idea you were one of the respected leaders here in the islands. It's but a pleasure. - Mr. Adderley misinformed you. I'm only a teacher of my people, not their leader. - I see, so what do you teach? - Freedom. To be free we must have our land back, because that is where our strength lies. - I understand. Tell me, is this how they win their freedom back? - Regretfully sir, when people have no voice in the government, it sometime leads to violence. - I think that people needs some decent wages. - That would be preferable. - None of us need any dead chickens here. Let's say I was willing to pay my boys here the same as the whites. That'll be quite a feather in your cap, wouldn't it? - Why would you make such an offer? - I can't afford any trouble here doctor. I just want to raise my chickens in peace. - Your chickens? - They're my chickens, sir. - I paid for them with my money. - The army pays you for them. You put out a way for the people who keep us beggars in our own country. - You want to try to get the other white farmers around here to pay what I just offered you? - But your fee not so special. So Harry Oakes already pays us high wages. - So Harry Oakes sir, is the richest man in the world. He can do what he wants. It's the rest of us you're gonna have to crack here, because the rest of us are living here now. We're not going anywhere. (engine blaring) (door slams) - Make a deal with this guy? - No no, I'm just agreeing to pay my boys what you pay yours. You got a problem with that? - Yeah, I got a problem. I got a bunch of fanatics that want to send the island up in flames. - The entire colonial world burns with revolution. The Bahamas can not devoid that fire. - You play with matches around me, you're gonna get burned. - Until I will get in then, Mr. Harry? (footsteps tapping) (soft music) - I don't know, I love this country as much as he does. - So long as he leaves me alone. - What makes you think he's going to leave you alone? Don't be foolish. Anyway, I didn't come here to talk to you about Dr. Gordon. - Come inside and have a drink. (soft music) - Okay. (footsteps tapping) - Oh well. - Oh, I got a proposition for you. - Really, what kind of proposition? - Well, I'd like to help you with your farm. I'll give ya some money for investments. - Are you serious? - Yeah, you can be a very rich man. - What's the catch? - Stay away from my daughter. - Harry, I'm willing to crawl back from hell on my knees to keep her. I love her. - Maybe you do but you're one strange bastard and I don't want you to ruin her life. - I'm not ruining her life. You're the one that's ruining her life. How does she stand the chance to become a woman if you don't give her the opportunity to make some choices? - I only want what's best for her, that's all I want. I can order her to stay away from you and I can send her to New York if I wanted to. - Well go ahead, nothing makes a woman more interested in a man when her own father wanting her off. - You already know all the angles. - I got no angles here, but why don't we let your own daughter make up her own mind about that. - You know what you are? - What? - You're a disappointment. I offer you my friendship and you betray me. - That's not true and your friendship Harry happens to be very important to me. - Then take the deal. Take the deal because if you don't I'll rip your hid out. (footsteps tapping) (motor revs) - Hot and cold running water, private office. You know what they call this place? The Country Club. - That means you want something else from me, right? - Will you listen to the man? What does it cost to listen? - [Charles] I'm listening. - See Sicily here. If Patton's army could take Sicily, we'd be able to pour invasion force right on up into Italy. - Suddenly I'm Eisenhower. - (laughter) Maybe you are Charles. In the Camarada Mountains, the old family still remember Luciano. - Well then my people, right? - [Officer] And we need the help. The terrain is a nightmare, but take Patton months to break through. But if your people were to organize an uprising against the Germans and the surrender of Italian troops. (footsteps tapping) (motor revs) - It's funny, huh? Doey and the Feds has us on the ropes. - Go to war on Mussolini, they're willing to give up their war on us. - We have to take advantage of this moment. You have Bugsy Siegel Los Angeles and it's Nevada, the Bahamas. - The Bahamas first. We'll send some guy down there to talk to. The Sir Harry Oakes. - I know just the guy. - [Harold] Mike Vincent. - Harold Christie. Well, well, well. Same old Harold underneath that $300 outfit? - Come on I'll take you to your hotel. This is quite a surprise. I didn't expect you to show up around here again. - Porter, this one here. Let's see now. Last time I saw you, you had a coast guard bullet in your gut. - Hmm, funny I don't remember that. (laughter) - That was 20 years ago. - I suppose you are going to tell me why you're here. - Oh Harold, it'll be a pleasure doing business with you again. - Business, what business? (group talking) (soft Caribbean music) - Good afternoon Marc Sorel and Lee Kinsley. - Let me know as soon as the Oakes arrives. Thanks a lot. (soft music? - Hello Freddy. (footsteps tapping) - Miss Oakes is here sir. (soft Caribbean music) - Hi. - Who's this little darling? Do the introduction Freddy. - For heaven's sake. - Maybe we should give Freddy a few minutes. - She can't be more than 12 years old. You have been busy, romantic evenings in the nursery. - Alfred, who is this? - Oh haven't you figured it out yet darling? I'm the wife. (soft Caribbean music) - Thank you Sam. Do you know what I feel like right now? I feel dirty. I feel like I'm covered in filth. - I married my friend there to out of the life that I told you about. We been divorced. - So what's she doing here? - She claims it's not legal. - You know, when I was a kid Nancy, I had to go to sleep in the streets. I know what it is to be dirty, honey. I know what it is to be covered in filth. I lived it, I made a living at it. And I did everything and anything I had to do in this world just to get out. Just to get out. You know I was dead here until I met you. Do you realize for the first time in my life, I actually get up in the morning Nancy. I got something to go for. I need you, I'm not playing games. I love you. You can't see that? - I never want to see you again, ever. (door slams) - My consortium proposes to build the most modern hotels and casinos in the Caribbean. Now the war is almost over gentlemen. That's gonna mean a tourist bonanza. This island has the potential to being the Monte Carlo of the Caribbean. - Well chaps, I guess you can see why I was so anxious for us all to get together. What do you say? - Aren't you forgetting that gambling is illegal in the Bahamas? - Laws can be changed Jim. - Exactly, now you gentlemen represent the business community and the lawmakers. We expect your support on this. - But again there's a problem with gambling. - Are you referring to Sir Harry Oakes? - He is completely opposed, Mike. - I was hoping that all of you could help convince him to change his mind. - Good luck on that one. (piano plays softly) - I guess you had him spotted right from the start, huh? - Well, I don't take much pleasure in that. - Yep, but it feels great to be right. - [Mr. Oakes] Come on now, do you think I know how you feel? (footsteps tapping) - Dad, I'm sorry. Hold me, please. - Sorry Red, I'll protect you, I'll always protect you. (tapping softly) (crying softly) No, no easy now. - Pull! (gunfire loudly) - Pull! (gunfire loudly) - I've prepared my report on de Marigny, sir. - Anything juicy? - Like a pomegranate, sir. - Go on. - It is my considered opinion that our Count is an unscrupulous adventurer with an evil reputation for immoral conduct, sir. - An evil reputation for immoral conduct. Well, I'm flattered. - Your deal with Dr. Gordon has already put patrol on incendiary racial situation. Now I find you broken British exchange control regulations by sending money to New York. - Wait a minute, I sent the first repayment on a farm loan in my bank. That's all. - You can't transfer money from British colony whenever you feel like it. England is at war. I hope you realize what this means. - I'm on the edge of my seat. The Duke could be forced to place your name before the executive council as a person subject to deportation. - Deportation, okay. Let me tell you something. You know, if he deports me, he's gonna have to deport half the white population on Nassau because everybody's pushing money out of this country illegally. And if the rumors on Wall Street happen to be correct, that includes your Royal Highness. - Might I make a suggestion? - Please. - Leave on your own steam before you're thrown out. - Who's gonna throw me out, the Duke? You know, that guy I'm telling you, just between you and I, he's nothing but a pompous little pimple on the ass of the British Empire. (motor revs) - Pimple! - I believe I'm quoting him exactly, sir. - My God, I'll run him into the ground yet, I will. - Yes, sir. In the meantime, your next appointment is here. - I don't want to see anyone. - This chad appears to be a person of some consequence. - Don't you make some excuse. Shaking hands all day along. - You really should see this one. Sir, he's an urgent business man and just made a donation of $50,000 to the governor's war fund. - All right, show him in. - Sir. (footsteps tapping) Mr. Vincent, sir. - Ah, Mr. Vincent. - Your Highness, this is a real pleasure, sir. (footsteps tapping) - There she is, come on. - Happy birthday darling. - Listen, why don't you let us give you a birthday party and we can have clowns, beautiful-- - Hush. Are these from Dennis? Thanks Sam. de Marigny knows when to quit, does he? - Just give them to the staff. - [Samuel] Much obliged ma'am. - Wait, a minute Red, here come on, look. For me to you, happy birthday. Go ahead and take it. You can even open it. (gasping lightly) - That's beautiful, thank you. - Nancy, what's wrong? - Samuel. (footsteps tapping) (group singing and dancing) (crowd yells) (drummers playing) (crowd singing) - Whoa, hey, honestly is this coincidence? - Marc may have mentioned something. Stop all this (mumbles) old friend. I don't want you to hate me. - Never. - I couldn't stand that. - Never. - Why don't you stay and rest more. You don't mind if I come and cheer you on? It'll be like old times. I'm still your baby? - Whew! - Come back to the hotel with me. Talk things over. - Do you ever, ever stop. - I know you want to go on Monday, I want to help. - I don't need your damn help, get it! (crowd singing and dancing) - Everybody friends again? (mumbles) (crowd screams) (horns blaring) (announcer speaking) - At stake is the enormously prestigious Nasau Sailing Club trophy. The favorite is last year's champion, Dennis Boullion. - The amount of negotiations with Dr. Gordon. - I don't trust the charity of white men. But we could do with a few more like you. - That's not charity though. Those boys earn their money with their sweat. - (laughter) Well I'm pulling for you to win today. - [Alfred] Thank you. - Where's your crew? - Listen up, don't tell anybody, but you're looking at him. - You can't possibly race alone? - You wanna join me? - Well sorry old man, I can't swim. Don't tell. - How about I make this one day for the outcast? - Absolutely. (laughter) (announcer speaking) - Beautiful boat. - What are you doing here? - I really want to help you understand Alfred. We women owe each other a helping hand. - Somehow I don't think you could happen to understand anything. - Try this Miss Nancy. Alfred belongs to me. Ask him about that job on Wall Street. I got it for him. - How generous of you? - You of course are very rich. Alfred always did, salivate around wealth. Of course, when the gold comes off and you climb between the sheets. A man like Alfred needs a real woman, not a child. - You don't change my mind, I'm glad you came after all. - I'm going to tell you the truth. - Because now I know that no matter what Alfred did, he's paid for it a thousand times by being married to you. (upbeat band music) (announcer speaks) - He's finishing for his cast off. - [Nancy] What do you mean? - He's sailing solo. (mumbles) - Well, that's one less for Dennis to beat. We're all rooting for him to win, aren't we? - Yeah, it's a shame the Count's all on his own. It seems the British fair's playing a bit cockeyed today, don't you think? (upbeat music) (footsteps tapping) (announcer talking) - What are you waiting for? We have a race to win. (upbeat music) (boom loudly) (upbeat music) (announcer talking) (upbeat music) (announcer talking) (squeaking loudly) (water splashing) (squeaking loudly) (announcer talking) - [Announcer] And in a daring maneuver, de Marigny (mumbles). (upbeat music) (gun blaring) (audience cheers) And it's official, (mumbles) flying in the Dark Hole number 12 is Alfred de Marigny. Moving across second (mumbles). (laughter) (horns blaring) (audience applause) (soft music) (door slams) - All right, hold it, just hold it right there. - Hi. - A little late for dinner young lady. - I'm sorry, we just came-- - Just get in the house. (breathing heavily) - You don't have to see him anymore. I'm sending you to New York. - Wait a minute, I'm not going anywhere. - You need to trust us Nancy. We're trying to save you from making a terrible mistake. - Can we talk this out? - No, we can't talk it out! - Please. - Get off my property before I sic the dogs on you. - Will you get in the truck? I want you to come home with me, right now. - [Ms Oakes] Harry. - Do you hear me? Nancy. - Dad, please. - [Mr Oakes] Get in the house! - Come home with me. - I can't just run away. - Are you listening to him? Would you look at him. (soft music) - I'll talk to them. I'll make them understand. (soft music) This doesn't mean that I don't love you, I do. (soft music) - I told you, just get off my property. (footsteps tapping) - You want to know my prescription for the blues? Roger's fraternity is having a party on Saturday night. - Not in the mood for a party. - Now that is something I never thought I'd hear Nancy Oakes say. (soft music) - Things have changed. - There must be some guy. - Yes. - Personally, I'll leave a guy for a party. (soft music) But I would never leave a party for a guy. (waves crashing) (footsteps tapping) (people talking) - Hey Mikey. - Boss. - Thank you for coming. Welcome to Miami. Put some music on baby. Who wants to hear anymore about the damn war. - It's turning out to be a good war for us. - Opportunity of a lifetime. That's why I'm so disappointed in you. (upbeat music) Why won't Sir Harry Oakes let us build our casino? - Sir Harry Oakes isn't interested in a casino. - You were supposed to make him interested. - You got to understand boss. There are things beyond money to that crazy old man. He has absolutely no incentive to cooperate with us. - Maybe we'll give him one. Sit. (upbeat music) (laughter) - This is dynamite. - Are you sure you won't join us? Roger's got this friend, dark ruby eyes. I told him more about you. - Oh no, I might take a walk later. - A walk, haa. How exciting? I get a hot flash just thinking about it. But you will join us to the party tonight. No excuses this time. (door slams) (footsteps tapping) (paper rattles) (clock chimes) (fingers snap and singing) ♪ It had to be you ♪ ♪ Wonder around ♪ ♪ Finally found, somebody new ♪ ♪ For nobody else, I love you still ♪ ♪ It had to be you, wonderful you ♪ ♪ It had to be you ♪ (finger snaps) - Oh, you're crazy! (laughter) - Just had to be with you baby. (laughter) (kissing smacks) - Oh you're something. You're really something getting married behind our backs. I hope you're proud of yourself! - As a matter of fact I am. - Don't you know he's using you? You're behaving like a child, like a spoiled stubborn child. - I've never had a chance to act like an adult, finally I am. - What the hell is that supposed to mean? - You two trying to set me up with Dennis. Never asking me what I want. Always telling me what you want. - All I wanted is for you to be happy. For you to find your rightful place here. - Oh, what's that supposed to mean? I'm not some princess in a fairytale. I'm a married woman now. - You were the daughter of a miner and an office stenographer. We worked long and hard to be accepted here and now you're making us look contemptuous. - Now, wait a minute, wait a minute. - It's true! - All right, all right easy. We're all going crazy here! Now let's just settle down. Now all your mother and I are trying to say to you is that we care about you. We care about you very much. - I know you do, but you've got to let me live my own life. - Now this is ridiculous! - Oh great! You said your piece, now I'm supposed to just shut up! - You're damn right! (footsteps tapping) - Red! (bringing heavily) - You've got to stop bullying me dad. - I guess you're right. You've grown up. You found some grit for yourself. (birds chirping) - I am my father's daughter. - Yeah. Okay, all right now, what do you want? I'll give you a big allowance if you want it. - No I don't want your money. I want your blessing. - You, you're gonna get an invitation to the royal polo match and you'll be there. - All right, but listen the Duke and I aren't in each other's fan clubs. - I couldn't care less about you and the Duke. Is that understood? And other thing, if there's any trouble in this family it's strictly private, you got that? You understand? - Fine. - You remember something too dad. - (breathing heavily) I'm Alfred's wife now. (crowd talking) (horses galloping) (whistle blowing) - Where the hell is Nancy? - She's your daughter. (soft music) - How much money do you have? - Does it matter? - No, now that I'm your wife, I want you to have half of everything that I have. (soft music) - You know how much I love you? (soft music) (horses galloping) (crowd talking) (whistle blows) (horses gallop) - Sir Harry is being so difficult. I'm afraid there could be some unfortunate publicity. - Publicity? - Hmm, mm. My friends tell me you invited British currency exchange laws by sending cash to Mexico. - Ah, you're mistaken. - Cash siphoned off from the funds London sends you. A million pounds so far. (horse gallops) Please don't embarrass both of us by trying to deny it. I have documents. - What kind of documents? - The Banko Continental in Mexico City. (horses gallop) - What about you Sir Harry? No protest stations of innocence about that gold you've been shipping to Mexico? - You really think you can threaten me? - Harry, I don't approve of Vincent confronting us like this, but all he wants really is to build his casino. - Well if that's all, why not? - What's the matter with you? Don't you know who this guy represents? (audience applause) - It's my understanding a respected business man. - They're gangsters... They're gangsters, they deal in corruption, prostitution and drugs and then they make it look legal by using the-- - Harry, you want everybody to know about your gold shipments? - You better understand something my friend. Your threats don't bother me and his threats don't bother me. - Oh for heaven's sake Harry, does every business deal have to be a test of your integrity? - Why do ya... Why do you have to be so damn naive? - Harry. You're not the only one around here with a vision for the Bahamas. - I have a vision, your vision's blurred Harold. These are the most beautiful islands in the world and I'm not going to sell them over to a bunch of gangsters. - Oakes! I offered you my hand and you spit in my face. - You looking for a fight sonny. Are you looking for a fight 'cause I'll give... Naw naw, I'll give you a lesson right here and now. - You may be king of this island, but today you just threw it all away. (group talking) - Unspeakable, how he loved every rich woman in New York, London and Paris. No, de Marigny raped Nancy. She only married him because he got her pregnant. - My child's not like that! My child's not like that. She's not, she's not, Eunice. She's a good girl. No, I don't care. Let me out. (footsteps tapping) (pounding doors) - Ah, you. I should have had you horse whipped and I should've thrown you in the gutter to rot. - [Nancy] You're out of your mind. - You're coming home with me tonight, just want you to know! - Get away from her! Get away, hey! - Come here! - Get your hands off me! - Get away from her! - You know, you're nothing but a ruthless old man. You're trying to prove that you own everything in this place including your own daughter. - Get outta my face! - You know what you're really upset about? Here's your little daughter before someone else do her daddy. - Oh! - Stop it! (crashing loudly) (yells loudly) - Go ahead and touch her! Touch her again! I'll kill you. (ominous music) - Let me get up. Either him or it's me. It's your last chance to come home. - (crying softly) This is my home. - From this moment on, I have no daughter. (ominous music) (door slams) (wind blowing) - Will you forgive me? (breathing heavily) - I can't stand the way you two hate each other. - That's how he wants you to feel. So, just got to grow up about that. - Don't tell me to grow up. You're just as bad as he is. If I'm such a child, why did you marry me? - Oh, I suppose you think it was for the money. - That's what everybody else thinks. (rainfall loudly) - What if you were to go away for a while? Let me stay here and try to patch things up with him. (thunder crashing) Would you let me do that? (footsteps banging) - Hey kiddo. - Yeah, pumpkin, yeah. I'm fine. Well I'm not fine, no. I don't understand. I used to be her hero. I taught her how to ride her horse. She looked so beautiful and she was so happy. - Well Nancy just called. She wants me to go to New York with her. - New York? - I think it's a good idea, don't you? (soft music) - Sure, okay. - You'll be okay when I'm gone? - Sorry I'm acting like a two year old. I have to tell you something. I really, I'm not very good at compliments. - (giggles) Oh. - No, I'm not. But you are a real goldminer's girl. Give me a kiss, come on. (laughter) (soft music) (crowd talking) - Don't worry about anything now. I'll take care of your father. You just enjoy yourself. (kiss smacks) - Okay. - I love you. - I love you too. (upbeat music) (upbeat drums) - The spirit of our oppressed people will create a new power! - Yes! - The beliefs of our fathers and their father before them! Will make us strong! - Yes! - Are we ready to burn the plantation? - Yes! - To take our freedom! - Yes! - Burning and killing. Burning and killing! Is that the only way for us to be free? The only way to drive the British out is to use terror! - Yes! (upbeat drums) (thunder crashing) (crowd laughing) - Freddy! - What do ya think you're doing? - A celebration, I just bought the coconut plantation. The beginning of my empire. - Yeah, who do you think is flipping the bill? - Oh it's a boring detail. Freddy, I want two of the most beautiful women in the Bahamas. Come on! (thunder crashing) - I want that casino. If I can't be queen of England, then I'll make my own kingdom here, a new riviera. - Harry will never change his mind. - So you're gonna let him walk all over you the same way de Marigny did. They both mad you the laughing stock of the island. - I'll think of something. (rainfall loudly) Why can't it be like the old days between us? - Aw, it can be David. It can be. - You will think of something, won't you? (moaning lightly) (thunder clashing) (tapping quickly) (soft music) (rainfall loudly) (group humming) - Okay what's bothering you? - I keep thinking about this casino business. - I don't want to talk about casinos. - No need to yell at me. - I'm sorry, I just don't want to talk about it. I feel that I've lost Nancy. - Lost Nancy, nonsense. - It's true. - She's a woman now. No longer a young girl. You've got to start accepting that. You've got to start accepting things, Harry. - She hates me. - She adores you. She's trying to measure up. Be her father's daughter. - I love her so much. - Aw Harry, I look at you and I feel nothing but envy. You've got a wonderful family. - Well if you believe that how come you never got married? - I did, to the Bahamas. (laughter) Harry. - Maybe. Maybe. I don't know. Well, maybe I should call her in the morning and say I'm sorry. - And you've got to start mending your fences for the Count. Your problem is, you see too much of yourself in him. - I'm not going to do that. - An independent cuss like you. Give him a chance. Give things a chance Harry. - Maybe, maybe. - Maybe? - Maybe. (rain downpours) (crowd talking and laughing) - Goodnight! (yells loudly) Oh, he's wet. (laughter) Thank you Freddy. (rain downpours) (phone clicks) (laughter) (door slams) - Bye. - Bye. (door slams) (ominous music) (loud thud) (rainfall loudly) (engine revs) (ominous music) (footsteps tapping) (lock jingling) (fire crackling) (birds chirping) (footsteps tapping) (clap loudly) - Good morning Samuel. - [Samuel] Good morning sir. - Harry, Harry old boy. Beautiful morning out here old champ. Harry. (ominous music) Oh my God. (engine roaring) (door slams) (footsteps pounding) - Stop sir! - It's all right sergeant, let him in. (ominous music) (crying softly) - Harry. (gag quickly) How can anyone do that? How can anyone do that? - Come here for a moment. We'll find whoever did this. (footsteps tapping) (crying softly) You'll know more in a few hours. - Who could've done this? - Could be anyone, sir. Just starting on inquiries. - Oh my God, how am I gonna tell my wife (crying profusely). How am I gonna tell my wife? - We need to keep this quiet for the moment. I'll contact Lady Oakes. Colonel Lindop. - Sir? - I want a band on all radio and press messages out of Nassau. Total censorship. - Sir. (footsteps tapping) - You're not keeping this out of the papers, you know. Hey, can you hear me? I don't care who you are. You're not keeping this out of the papers. - Get a hold of yourself, man. Never too far. I want to talk with you later. (crying quietly) (water splashing) (boat horn blaring) - It's not too extravagant. It's a beautiful dress on you. You've got a lot of wear out of it. Now we have to convince your father to buy a decent suit. (gasps softly) It's gonna be harder. (phone ringing) - I hope he had a chance to talk to Alfred. - Would you get that? I'm going to put this up. (phone ringing) - Hello. Could you speak up, I can't hear you. I said could you speak up, I can't hear you. - Is it your father? - I don't know, it's a long distance operator. Hello,. Oh your Royal Highness. Um, yes she's right here, hold on. - Who? - Here take this. - David. - My dear Eunice, I didn't want you to hear over the radio. - Did something happen? Is it Harry? (breathing heavily) No, no I heard you. Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God, no! (screams loudly) - I just sent a woman to hell. - [Duchess] Is Erskine Lindop investigating this personally? - Until I can get someone over from Scotland Yard. You think that's wise? I mean, we're not exactly angels, are we? - No, surely our financial transactions are irrelevant. - Irrelevant enough to boot you enter the tower for treason. - Vincent called me. Everybody down there is laying odds it was a voodoo killing. - I want someone to swing for this. - The British cops don't need us pulling strings. They'll stick somebody, sooner or later. - I want it to be sooner than later before my parole comes up. - Lucky, relax. - I don't want to relax! What if the Feds tumbled to the casino project? They're gonna think I put out a contract on Oakes and I'm gonna be here for the next 1,000 years! - Wont' happen. Everything's going great. I'm ready to drop the money and supplies to all the old families in Sicily. - Well the old families in Sicily aren't waiting on parole. (water splashing) - Sir Harry was the only one who ever gave us anything, but people are saying the other landowners murdered him. We can use that, one strong push from you. The people will rise. - It is a time of great sadness. I shall organize a march in memory of Sir Harry. - And after the march, mass demonstrations. - Yes! It is time! - Yes, it is time! - With all due respect, this a British investigation. - This thing too big for us, we need help. (engine blaring) You know what to do. - Sir. (motor revs) - So, what's this all about Colonel? - It appears a new investigating officers want to see you. (door slams) - Did you say Miami? - Yes, sir. - [Alfred] See I don't get this. - Maybe you should ask the Duke for enlightenment. - Listen, the Miami Police Department's been under investigation for years. - It's a interesting case but I'm quite sure we could've managed without bringing you here. - I gotta get to the airport. My wife's due any minute now. - We can arrange to have them picked up, sir later. - Gentlemen, this is Mr. de Marigny. - So you're the Count? We should've broken out the drinks and the dancing girls. - I drove a couple dinner guests home and I went back to my farm. - Why did you stop outside this house? - I told you I was tired, I was upset and I wanted to stop and think. - At 1:30 am in the middle of a storm. - For a few minutes, yeah. - You were on bad terms with the old man, weren't you? - Yeah, I regret I was. I hope he did too. You're not entertaining the idea that I might've killed him, are you? - We'd like to examine you under a microscope. Any objections? - No. (ominous music) Why? - [Investigator] Purely routine, we'll be doing this with everybody. - [Assistant] Hold up your hands. - This is supposed to be the microscope? Where'd you get that, the junior G-man club? - It's a nasty burn you got there. - Yeah, it happened last night when I was lighting a candle. (ominous music) - Take off your shirt. (water crashing) (motor revs) (footsteps pounding) (crying softly) - Did you see my father? - I'm so sorry. - The murderer struck Sir Harry above the head with a heavy blunt instrument. He then poured insecticide on Sir Harry while he was still alive. But stunned, he then set him on fire. Now apparently-- - Aye, do we really have to listen to this now? - No, I want to hear it. - Mother you're exhausted. - I want to hear it all. - Because of the bloodied hand marks on the wall, we believe that the heat revived Sir Harry and he staggered around the room. And despite the excruciating pain, he valiantly fought off his attacker. - I keep thinking about how he died. (crying softly) I close my eyes and I can see him burning. He must've been in so much pain. He must've screamed. (crying softly) I want to call out to him, but he can't hear me because of the flames. - Shoooo. You're safe. (crying softly) I couldn't go through this without you. - No one who knew Harry would ever accuse him of being a patient man. He loved life too much for that. (footsteps banging) I'm sure he's restless for these ceremonies to end so he can begin his journey. Harry spent most of his life traveling the world. When I met him in Australia, he was a goldminer from Maine. Who made his fortune in Canada, but this is the place he loved the most. I know that when I come back here, I will feel only grief, the emptiness and the loss, but for Harry, all is well. He's truly home now. Goodbye my love. Godspeed. (soft music) - If there's anything I can do-- - No. - Nancy, your father was a great man. He was a great friend to me. - Thank you. - I'd like to sponsor some sort of a memorial to him. Perhaps scholarships to local children. - Ah, he would've liked that, thank you. - Will you walk with me? - Yes. - I think Mrs. Oakes is giving you a hard time. - Yeah, I don't know why the Duke would stand on me. Might as well suffer for the keystone cops. - Even so, watch your steps around. You know where I am, if you need me. (soft music) - Is there anybody in Nassau you know might have a reason for killing Sir Harry? - There's no one here with a personal reason. I understand he had some enemies and a great deal of money. - Woo, ha hot isn't it? I thought Miami was hot. Can you pour me a glass of water? - Why you wasting time? - What? - Just beginning to see why the movies always show you guys as dumb flat foots. (laughter) (water pouring) - If I told you you were seen on these grounds the night of the murder, what would you say? - I'd say it's a damn lie. You can't believe I had anything to do with this. The man was my wife's father for God's sake. - Everything okay? - Okay. I'll check out. Let's go inside. (soft music) (footsteps banging) (ominous music) (footsteps tapping) - Alfred de Marigny. - Alfred. - Mrs. de Marigny, please. Alfred de Marigny, I have here a warrant for your arrest on the charge of murdering Sir Harry Oakes. I must warn you that anything you say may be taken down and used as evidence against you. - No. (ominous music) (crowd talking) - Sir Harry Oakes was murdered, because he dared to pay us a decent wage! (crowd yells) Because he dared to talk fees with us! - Yeah! - When we worked for Sir Harry, we were real men. - Yeah! - Good as any Englishman! - [Worker] That's right! - Yeah! - Sir Harry's killer must die! (crowd yells) (drums banging) - [Major] The crowd could rush the jail at any moment, sir. They want to lynch him. - This isn't Dodge City major. - Dr. Gordon is trying to make a political issue of it. - Just blowing hot air. - Not this time sir. He's saying that de Marigny was hired by the other landowners to kill Sir Harry. That we're gonna set a show trial and let him off. - Not bloody likely. (crowd yells) (engine blaring) - Sir Harry's killer must die! (crowd yells) (drums banging) - Please! - Wait, Sir Harry's daughter! (crowd talking) (drums banging) - Let her pass, please. - He's in my office. (door slams) - No, no come on it's all right. It's all right. Let's just call Adderley and get me out of this God forsaken place. - I can't believe this is happening. - Let's not be afraid of a stupid mistake okay. I can be outta here by tomorrow. Now you call the man, he said he'd help. - There are people out there that want to hang you. - There is no one here who's going to hang me. I'm gonna be home in the morning. Just stop, would you? (kiss smack) Come on. You gotta stay with your mother tonight anyway. You're all she has left. Deal with the anyway, right? (crowd yells) - Evidence is there, it's pretty clear. - Somehow I always knew it had to be him. - Alfred could never do those terrible things. - That's what he'd like us to believe. I'm sorry Ms. de Marigny, but he's smart, your husband. He made it look like some black magic nut did it. - That's crazy. - It's no use in pretending Nancy. He has a burn on his hand. - What does that prove? - He set your father on fire. We have him tied to the burning. (soft music) (footsteps tapping) - We must ease racial tensions. His Royal Highness wants this trial concluded as swiftly as possible. - But surely, that's a matter for the prosecutor? - You're being uncommonly optimistic old man. - Me? - You're the best barrister in the Caribbean. - I see. Then this is a direct request from his Royal Highness? - Well, the Duke did ask me to talk to you before he makes it, for sure. - I'm sorry, Mr. Adderley has decided to prosecute. - I can't believe this. - Well, someone was obviously determined he wouldn't get in for the defense. - So who else can we get? - I've got a few inquiries in the island. Looking for the best barrister I can. Unfortunately-- - Well they all take it for granted, I'm guilty. - Well, no one wants to go up against Mr. Adderley, you see. So what I've decided if it's okay with you, is bringing someone from London. - No, no, no, an outsider is no good here. I need someone who knows the way things are run down here. You know, someone like yourself. - Me? - Why not you? - You're joking. - Listen, I'm not joking, as of right now I need you and I want you to defend me. - I'm a taxed divorce man. I can't remember the last time I tried a real case. - Well how difficulty can this be? I don't have a motive for killing my father-in-law. - What motive of 200 million pounds left in Harry's estate? - What the hell are you saying? You think I'm guilty? - I haven't made up my mind yet. (instrumental music) (crowd talking and laughing) - Sorry I'm late darling. (kiss smack) - Annie's staying overnight. It's the one rare evening off to ourselves. - Godfrey, now what's this I hear about you defending the Count? - There's no such thing well is it? Nancy did ask me to defend him. But I've advised her to bring in the big guns from London. - I'm so glad, I'm sure Joyce would hate to see your reputation sullied by such a vile character. - I try never to make moral judgements about Godfrey's clients. Doesn't British justice allow every dog his day in court? - Well fortunately, I'm not a lawyer's wife. I think anyway who defends scum is worse than scum. (soft music) Lovely to see you both. - Hmm, charming. Seems like everyone wants to stretch de Marigny's neck. - You're not planning to take a hand? - No, I'm not the man of for case. (soft music) Anyway I'm almost certain de Marigny is guilty. - Then why do you have that look in your eye? - What look? - The look that says your sense of fair play has been deeply offended. - Thank you Angie. (footsteps tapping) You honestly believe that he's innocent? - He is innocent. - How can you be so blind? Hasn't he degraded you enough? You've turned your back on me, on your father, on your whole family. - That's not true. I love Alfred the way you love dad. - Ah, no. - All right, maybe it was my money that attracted his at first. - [Eunice] Maybe? - But can you honestly say that when you first met dad, that you were just a little bit attracted to that goldmine of his. (smack loudly) - That'll be all Ruby. (breathing heavily) - You loved dad. I love Alfred. It doesn't matter what brought us together. - He killed your father! - No he didn't! I may as well tell you, I've hired someone to help me prove it. - What's the point of that? - Alfred needs help. - I'll help him all right. I'll help him. I'll stand up in court and make sure that he's hanged by the neck until he's dead. (footsteps pounding) (dogs barking) - Motive, if you didn't kill him who did? - I don't know Godfrey, you know maybe a thief. There are a lot of rumors. - No, no, no a thief wouldn't have taken the trouble to burn the body and then cover it in feathers. - Try Dr. Gordon, he uses a lot of voodoo in his routines. Listen Godfrey, I am thrilled that you're taking this case, but buddy, I am beginning to feel a rope here. (sheep baaing) - All right, what about the marks on the wall? - There were hand prints and there was smudge with blood. There was also mud and sand and footprints and they're all over the stairs. - You mean they weren't all washed away by the storm? - The inside stairs. - [Godfrey] Inside? - Yeah, the police went up the stairs cord it off, why? - Well it's just that the American detectives are saying that the murderer entered by way of the outside stairs. (doorknob opens) (footsteps tapping) - First thing I want to do is bring my own fingerprint expert in here. What's the problem? - The police have taken down the barriers. They're cleaning in the stairs. - What the hell do you think you're doing? - Our orders are to clean the house sir. - You're removing crucial evidence. - [Man] Make sure those floors are clean! - [Worker] Yes sir. (footsteps tapping) - How can you be so damn irresponsible? You appear to have removed the fingerprint evidence from the staircase and the walls. Those prints could have belonged to the murderer. - They're not the Counts. I mean, why confuse the evidence. (ominous music) (plane propellors) - Mr. Shindler. - I'm sorry you must've made a mistake. - I'm sorry. - Excuse me, ah maybe I'm the one you're looking for. You're Mrs. de Marigny? - You're Mr. Schindler? - You were expecting maybe Humphrey Bogart, right? (giggles) How's that? - The car is this way. So did you have a chance to review the case? - Case, what case? Your husband is dangling by his thumbs. - You've got to believe he's innocent. - You got two chances, bad and none. - Do you make a habit of hanging your own clients? - Look Mrs. de Marigny, what I make a habit of doing is trying to find out what happened. Hanging is for the jury. Now, I'm trying to help you. - How can we go to trial, there's no evidence? It's all circumstantial. - Murder convictions on circumstantial evidence are the rule rather than the exception. I'm sorry to tell you that. Thank you very much. Look, want to know what I think? - Please. - I'll tell you what I think. Evidence of a motive in this case is gonna be critical. The prosecution is gonna try to prove that your husband was a womanizer, a fortune hunter. - That's ridiculous, how can they prove that? - Wait a minute, he was up to his eyeballs in red ink, was he? - My mother dug up some bank statements that showed that he was overdrawing, but I haven't had enough time to ask him about it. - Well believe me, the jury's gonna have all the time they want to to ask about it. (motor revs) (birds chirping) - Did anyone actually see you burn your hand on the candle? - One of Mark's friends did. I don't know why you haven't asked her. - What, the friend of one jigalow mind to protect another one? - My friends call me jigalow, Mr. Schindler. - I hate to tell you something pal. They gonna be throwing that word around the courtroom everyday. - The biggest problem is the growing public hostility towards you. They're gonna poison the atmosphere in the court. - Well I don't see how anyone here can even consider that I'm part of a plot against these workers. - Because they're scared. They think that Harry's death is gonna mean fewer jobs, lower wages. - You've done your homework. - What I've been doing is hanging around the marketplace. It's crazy what goes on down there. Nut stuff. Look at this, voodoo. I mean, look, scary huh? - Are you serious? - I'm not the one looking at a trap door opening up under my feet. - Mr. Schindler, if you don't think you can handle the investigation-- - Hey, I can make a stab at it. It doesn't require a classical education. Did I tell you what else they're saying down there. They're saying that you rapped your wife. That you got her pregnant and you forced her to marry you. - Oh really? - Yeah, in fact they're even printing it up. Leaflets, here look. - What am I supposed to say to that? - It's hot stuff, read it. Perversions and orgies. - You can't see that someone is doing this to me? - Yes, of course but if the jury believes it, then you're done for. - Well your job gentlemen is to find out who's behind it. (footsteps tapping) - Grieving widow in black is gonna put the noose around our clients neck. - You see I've hired a private detective to help with the defense and until dad's will is settled, that's money I don't have. - Yes, I see. - I need your help, Harold. Mother won't give me anything. - Oh, I understand I'm sorry. - No, I'm good for it. I stand to inherit a lot of money. - Oh I know that and Alfred knew that and now he's in the dark for murder. I can't let you squander another penny on this. - Yeah, but please. You're the only one I can turn to. I need your help. - I am helping you darling, by not helping you. (footsteps tapping) - Hey you could've had the courtesy to send your refusal. - What do you mean? - I sent you a lot of messages pal. - Yes, yes, I regret the situation very much. - You regret? What you're gonna stand here now and tell me not your friend? Can you see someone's taken out everybody that could possibly help me here including you? - Well I'm doing my job. - Oh, I thought your job is to find the truth. - My job is to serve the crown and stop these islands from being torn apart! - Your job is to find the truth! (soft music) - May I please my Lord, gentlemen of the jury. The prosecution will prove that Alfred de Marigny murdered Sir Harry Oakes in cold blood with malice of forethought. A murder as black as hell, as dark as night. A deed which could only originate in a depraved and sadistic mind. (ominous music) - You helped the Count get his chicken farm off the ground, didn't you Curtis? You must know him pretty well. - He's a good boss, he's a good man. - I'm thinking maybe it was you who drove him to Westborn the night Sir Harry was murdered. - No, I didn't drive him anywhere. (punch loudly) - You'll be out of a job when your boss is hanged. Who's gonna look after you then? - Do yourself a favor Curtis. - Tell us what time you drove the Count to Westborn. - I didn't drive him anywhere. (loud thud) - Mr. Christie, did your friend Harry ever discuss with you his relation with the accused? - He said that he and the Count had a strained relationship. They couldn't help arguing every time they met. - Were these arguments violent? - Harry told me that the Count once attacked him with a candlestick and threatened to kill him. (crowd whispers) - [Mr. Adderley] No further questions, sir. - Now did you wake at anytime that night, Mr. Christie? - Yes, twice I think. I was awakened by the mosquitoes. - I get you did not hear or see any sign of disturbances. - No. - Even though Sir Harry was being violently bludgeoned to death in the room next door to you. - No. - Even though he was on fire and must have been crying out in terrible pain. - I told you I slept through it all. - Yes, yes. So you did Mr. Christie. Except for the mosquitoes. (soft music) (crowd talking) - [Mr. Adderley] Did you ask the accused if he had ever been inside the master bedroom? - He told me he had never been inside. - Now you say that the screen was in the master bedroom. Did you examine the screen for fingerprints? - I did, but as you can see, the screen was badly burnt, but there were plenty of prints left. They all belonged to Sir Harry, Lady Oakes, some of the household servants, except for one. - And to whom did this fingerprint belong? - It belonged to finger number five. The little finger on the right hand of Alfred de Marigny. - Alfred de Marigny who claims that he had never been inside that master bedroom. (loud gasps) (crowd whispers) - Get this, the cops found de Marigny's fingerprints at the scene of the crime. He's as guilty as sin (laughter). - We're in the clear? - Oh you've got nothing to worry about Mr. Lansky. de Marigny has already got his head in the noose. - I'm not worried, that's your job. Remember that Mikey. - Don't worry about a thing Mr. Lansky. (phone slams) (upbeat music) - We are doing the right thing. - Would you rather stay with all these questions flying around? - I'm sorry sir, it is important. It's Dr. Gordon, he's organizing a march on Nassau. - March? - I believe you should stay sir. - That's out of the question Lieutenant. The American tourist much too important to Canada. - Yes, I'm sure you chaps can handle a mild demonstration or two. In the case of a real emergency, Major Nickles know where to contact us. Make sure they get this special order. - Sir. (soft music) (plane propellors) - Wait a minute, this is simple. This happened after Harry's body was discovered. - You said you were never in the bedroom. - Not before the murder, no, but the next morning the police commissioner sent for me. He took me upstairs. - Hold it. You're saying the commissioner was with you? - Yes and when I could no longer stand the condition Harry was in, I got sick and that's when I touched that screen. - So you grabbed the screen and that was the morning after the murder? - Correct. - Is this gonna end up likely to remember? - How could he forget? I was an emotional wreck. - We've got to get him here right away. (upbeat music) (footsteps tapping) - Pardon me ma'am, the Commissioner, where is he? - Posted to Trinidad, the orders came through yesterday. (soft music) - Your daughter evidently did not share your poor opinion of her husband's character, did she? - No, he was able to exert a hold over her. - A hold? What kind of a hold? - Sexual, of course. - Mother? - Good girls like dangerous men, one might say. - I protest this cheap innuendo. Mr. Adderley is leading the witness into the realm of inductive speculation. - I will not permit that kind of remark, Mr. Adderley. - I have no further questions my Lord. - Lady Oakes, can you deny that your daughter genuinely loves the accused? - It isn't love. It's the immature passion of a school girl. - de Marigny is an older man who's made a profession of attracting women, he's a dooster. - [Mr. Higgs] Lady Oakes-- - She was forced to marry him! - Not true Eunice, you know it's not true! (crowd talking) - I tolerate no further disruptions in this courtroom. Count de Marigny, control yourself. Lady Oakes, do try not to indulge in speculation. Kindly limit your testimony to what you know to be true. - I know that my daughter is married to a murderer. - My Lord, really? - I know, that I have nothing to live for anymore. He destroyed my family. Everything that I love, he's taken away from me. (audience gasps) Why didn't he kill me as well. You should've killed me as well. - [Mr. Higgs] My Lord-- - Kill me! (crowd uproars) - [Judge] Silence! Silence! (ominous music) Silence! I must have silence! (footsteps tapping) - Something wrong David? - Nancy Oakes. She wants me to send Colonel Erskine Lindop back to Nassau to testify. - She is not going to stop, is she? Doesn't she know she's ruining her life with that fortune hunt. - Not for a fortune hunt, my dear. For love. - What will you tell her? - That I know how she feels. (footsteps tapping) (soft music) - There was a time when nothing else mattered to me except love, not even my crown. I didn't realize until too late that in abdicating my responsibilities, I also forfeited respect. My dear Nancy, as the King who gave up everything of love, I feel I can say this to you honestly and simply. Be practical, face facts, don't give up everything for love. (soft music) (crowd yells) (drums blaring) - Stop I say! (pound loudly) (crowd uproar) (glass breaking) (fighting heavily) - So are you all right? - Yeah, listen apart from the fact that everybody around here now wants me dead. I'm doing stupendously. So how are you? - I don't know. Mother's cut herself off me completely. She doesn't smile anymore. She won't talk to me. - She'll be all right, your mother. Just gotta be with her. - I will. - So what is it? - Colonel Lindop sent his deposition. - Oh. So he didn't say anything about me touching that screen? - How do you know that? - What the hell, you know? It's only a minor detail and somebody obviously, took damn good care not to ask him about it. - I guess so. - I thought you believed in me. - I do. - Would you please for once then come here and say that you believe in me please? - Let go of me! - What is it? - I can't take this anymore! - What is wrong? - Between you and my mother, I victim-- - Say you believe in me! - I don't know anymore! (footsteps tapping) (cage slamming) (drums beating) (crowd yells) (glass breaking) (banging loudly) (crowd laughing) (screaming loudly) (engine blaring) - Get back! (crowd yells) (shots fired) (crowd yells) (yells loudly) (gasps softly) (screams loudly) - Everything's all right honey. It's all right, it's all right. - Momma. - I'll stay with you. - Please, don't let me choose between you and Alfred. - Shoo, shoo, shoo. - Please, please. - Shoo, shoo. Go to sleep. Go to sleep. (people talking) (door slams) - I thank God you're all right. I have been going crazy. - I know, I'm sorry. - Ah, God. I'm not gonna blame you anymore for having doubts. - I did have doubts. - You gotta understand one thing and one thing only. I am not the man who killed your father. - All I know is, you're the most important person in my life. (door opens) - Would you please let me have this time with this woman alone? - I'm sorry Count, but you're running out of time. I was just down at Westborn trying to talk to that nightwatchman. - Edgar? - Yeah, that's right and he's disappeared. - What are you saying? - I don't know, those other servants won't talk. - Maybe he saw something. I mean, they're sure scared of something. Now listen I'm gonna need you to help me find him. - Okay. (kiss smacks) I love you. - You be careful, you hear me? - I will. (soft music) (door slams) What are you doing? - Nothing. - Turn left over the bridge. - Yeah, I see it. (motor revving) (children playing) (people talking) Excuse me sir, a Mrs. Kinbona, she live here? - She live right here. - Thank you. (sheep baaing) (knocking softly) Mrs. Kinbona, my name is Schindler. We're here to talk about your son, Edgar. - Mrs. Kinbona please. I'm Nancy de Marigny. - Edgar not here. - Do you know where he went? We need to talk to him. He was on duty the night my father was killed. - Edgar don't know nothing. You got to leave us alone. - Look Mrs. Kinbona, the life of this young lady's husband may depend on Edgar. We need your help. - Did he run away, was he afraid of something? - A man come looking for him, a yank. Next thing, Edgar gone. (ominous music) - An American, guy like me? - Don't want that man coming around here. That yank is a bad man. Leave us alone! (door slams) - One of those detectives from Miami. (ominous music) - The accused fingerprint, is it still on the screen? - I'm afraid not, no. The heat and humidity in these islands make fingerprints disappear in a couple of days. - But at least you were able to take a photograph of it on the screen. - No I didn't bring my fingerprint camera with me. I took an impression with a strip of gum rubber instead. It's a very reliable procedure. - Sir, since the fingerprint is no longer on the screen, nor do we have a photograph of it on the screen, we have only your word that it was even on the screen in the first place. (crowd whispering) - Yeah, I guess that's right. - My Lord, exhibit J can not possibly regarded as valid evidence. - You point I take it is that it might be a forgery? - It's absolutely my fear and my contention. - My Lord, the Duke of Windsor himself summoned Captain Barker as a fingerprint expert. - The court finds no reason to question Captain Barker's credentials and it accepts exhibit J as evidence. - Thank you my Lord. (crows whisper) (upbeat music) (engine blaring) - There was a car that was following me all the way home. You don't believe me. - That somebody followed you? Are you that desperate to prove a conspiracy that you're imagining things? - I'm imagining things? You imagined quite a few things in court the other day. (pouring lightly) (crickets croaking) - I didn't mean to hurt you. Please believe me. - Then just go down to the jail and talk to Alfred. - Nancy, face it. He's as good as dead. - What? - Get used to it, it gets better. Believe me, it gets better. - Or does it? Is it getting better for you, mother? - No! Your father was the love of my life. The only hope I have is not to feel anything. Nothing, no grief. Nothing. (soft music) - Then you understand how I feel. (phone ringing) (people talking) - Hello Miss Nancy, this is Edgar. I saw a boat. - [Nancy] What kind of boat? - One at the fancy boat lodges. It tied at Mr. Harry's dock. Men come ashore. - Okay, I have to see you. - [Edgar] I already said too much. - No, wait, wait! I have to see you Edgar, at midnight at the jetty. No one will see you, I promise. - Midnight. (phone slams) (footsteps tapping) - I sure wish you'd go back up to to the house. - No, Edgar sounded terrified. He might just take off if he doesn't see me. - Yeah it really would, yes. Wait a minute. You know this whole thing could be a setup just to get you in somebody's site. (gun clicking) Wait here. (ominous music) (water splashing) Can't find him, he's not here. - He's here. (people talking) (footsteps tapping) - Come on Lieutenant, Edgar didn't just throw himself in the water. Something stinks here. - You're saying he was murdered? - That's a British understatement, right? Yeah, I'm saying he was murdered. - You could be right. I just don't know what to do about it. - Well you can start by checking out our two Dick Tracy's. Melchen and Barker, they're rogue cops, you know? I mean, they got a bad history. - I'll check in with the Miami police. - Oh, good idea. - If you'll excuse me. - So who do you think killed Edgar? - Who knew you were meeting Edgar here tonight? - I didn't tell anybody. (engine blaring) - Telephone, did you hear anything like uh, a click maybe. - Now that you mention it, I think I did. (footsteps tapping) Now this is very important. I need to meet you, it's urgent. I've got to see you. 11 in the morning, Botanical Gardens. (ominous music) - Who's that? - It's a random number out of the telephone book Lady Oakes. Now we'll see who shows up. (children playing) - How will I know them? - I got a hunch it's somebody you already know. - So what do I do when I see them? - Nothing, absolutely nothing. (birds chirping) Listen, let's get this straight. I think that all we oughta do is make an identification here. I got a feeling that who ever it is knows something about Edgar's murder so, don't play Saint Joan, huh. - I'm scared. (guns clicks) - Don't you worry, I'm gonna be right near by. - It's almost 11 o'clock. - Beautiful, everything is beautiful here. - Yes, it's very peaceful. Harold, did you hear about Edgar? - Yes, I was very sorry about that. He was a good man. - The American detectives are saying it was an accident. I was in the room when he called. He told Nancy that there was several men here the night that Harry was killed. - Are you sure? There are crank calls after every murder. - No, it wasn't a crank call. You said it yourself. Edgar was a good man. (ominous music) [Eunice] Are you coming? - Yeah. (crowd talking) (soft music) - [Mr. Schindler] Nancy, Nancy run! Look out, run! Run, run down the stairs, run! Run, go quick! (footsteps pounding) (yells loudly) - He stole my bag! Get him! - You all right? They must be having a sale today on white suits. (ominous music) There's a guy over there under that beignet tree. Take a look. You know him? Huh? - My father and Mr. Christie are businessmen. - Oh yeah. Maybe you better go have a talk with Uncle Harold. (breathing heavily) - I can assure you that Michael Vincent is a very reputable business man. - Since he tapped my phone I'd say he's a little less reputable than you think. Would you agree? - I've sure he did nothing like that. - Tell me about Vincent, Harold. - My dear girl, England is at war, we live in a British colony, there are certain temporary restrictions that make it difficult for some of us to pursue our investments. - [Nancy] Currency controls. - Yes. Well, now it so happens, we manage to find a way around it. - How does that tie in with Vincent? Was he involved somehow with you and dad moving money around? - Well, he knew about it. Then he tried to convince us to help him. - Help him do what? - Simply to get certain games of chance, into some hotels. Boost tourism. - So he was blackmailing you and dad to help change the laws against gambling. You've got to tell the police about this. - Not bloody likely. Drag Vincent's name into this, you drag Vincent into this and he'll spill his guts about our foreign investments. I could be arrested, your father's name dragged threw the mud. You want that? - But if Vincent is behind this whole thing? - Your father's death is a mystery, but I can tell you, Vincent did not kill him. - How the hell do you know that? - It's backwards, they are never, never going to permit him to risk a tremendous business deal by committing murder. You can take my word for it. - For once Harold, your word isn't good enough. (footsteps tapping) (crickets chirping) (ominous music) - Take this. Leave us alone. (door slams) (footsteps tapping) - What's going on? - I wanna talk. - About what? - About your wife's safety. She's been asking too many questions. - Aye, you so much as go near my wife-- - Now Count, easy, easy. The way I see it you've got two choices. One that pretty little lady of yours keep digging up mud until it sticks on some friends of mine. At which case I'm gonna have to hurt her. Choice two, you get her to back off. - You killed Oakes? (laughter) - Are you kidding me? You killed Oakes. Nothing's gonna save you. (motor blaring) (door slams) (footsteps tapping) - Busy morning Ms. de Marigny. Your husband already has a visitor. - I'll find you. - Maybe, but let me ask you something Count. In all good conscious, is it worth risking even one hair of an innocent girl's head just to cause me just a little bit of embarrassment? (soft music) Oh, you recognize this? Pretty huh? Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. Want it? You think about what I might do. (laughter) - [Mr. Higgs] I call Alfred de Marigny. (footsteps tapping) I swear by almighty God that the evidence I shall give will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. - Your name is Alfred de Marigny. - It is. - Alfred de Marigny, did you or did you not murder Sir Harry Oakes? - No I did not. - Thank you. - Does that conclude your examination, Mr. Higgs? - Yes my Lord. Mr. de Marigny has nothing to hide. He's testifying because he wishes to answer honestly and completely all my learned friends most searching questions. - Count de Marigny, your statement from the Nassau Branch of the Royal Bank indicate that you had an overdraft of 58 pounds, seven shillings and sixpense at the time of Sir Harry's murder. You were desperate for money, weren't you? - No I wasn't desperate. I was worried. - As you have worried about money all of your life. You have met and courted many wealthy women, have you not? - [Mr. Higgs] Objection, question is prejudicial. - Sustained. - And you hope had you not for some monetary gain by marrying Sir Harry's daughter. - There he goes again my Lord. - Mr. Adderley. - I married my wife here sir, because I love her. - [Mr. Adderley] And how did you intend to support her? - I had a contract here at the time to sell eggs and broilers to the military bases and my prospects were excellent. - Excellent indeed since your bride stood to inherit over 100 million pounds upon her father's death. - That is very true. It' didn't occur to me to much at the time, but that is very true. - So it was merely a remarkable coincidence that Sir Harry was murdered at the time when you desperately needed money. - I am innocent here, sir. I didn't kill any-- - You have heard the police, testify that they have found your fingerprint on that screen in Sir Harry's bedroom. - No sir, I touched that screen the morning after the murder and the police commissioner was there and he saw me do it. - But Colonel Lindop deposition makes no mention of that. - Well you bring him back here and you ask him about it and he'll tell you he saw me do it. - Will he also tell us how he saw you burn your hand? - I burned my hand on a hurricane lamp. - Oh no sir, you burnt it while setting Sir Harry alight. - [Alfred] I didn't. - You left your fingerprint while bludgeoning him to death. - I didn't do it, I didn't do it. - You Count de Marigny, you murdered Sir Harry Oakes. (crowd talking) - What the hell were you doing? - It doesn't matter. - You told me he didn't know you. - Don't push this, I'm telling you. - If you don't tell me the truth about this I'm gonna take it to the papers. If it's the casinos, Harold Christie's currency deals, all of it. - Weren't you in court today, it's over do you understand? - You're innocent! - Don't judge me! You, you and your lillie white shore of a life you live. Who the hell are you anyway? You gonna judge whether I am or not. I can't hide, I'm a stinking sideshow back there. What the hell you running from? You want to pin a rap up on me? I got a hundred things to hang me for. What do you got? You don't know nothing about my past and don't ever consider you did. And do me a favor, you walk the hell outta here and don't bother coming back. - Alfred, what the hell is going on here? - Get outta here. - You're like a complete stranger. - Hey guard? - Just tell me-- - Guard! (door grinds) Get her out here! Bye, bye. - No! - You know, you're not the first story I accused, you're crazy over guys but in blinders to what he's really like. Your mother was right, that's what I'm saying. I took her for her money! Now get her outta here! (door slams) Get her outta here! - [Nancy] You bastard! I hate you! You bastard! (soft music) (footsteps tapping) (motor blaring) - You must be, Schindler? Seems to me that somebody failed to advise you how to dress for this climate. - Well you see in my line of work, I don't get much of a chance to frequent all those smart shops. You know, you got a nice place here. I mean, you could build a good hotel, maybe even a casino. - I agree with you. What is there really anything that we have to say to each other? - Sorry to bring you out here like this, but I got some news, big stuff. - Really? - Really, yeah Miss Nancy's leaving the Count. - I suppose that that was to have been expected. - Yeah, but the way she tells it, he threw her out. - Oh, that's supposed to mean something. - Yeah, means that he was lying to protect her. - Protect her, from whom? - From your old rum running friend, Mike Vincent. Even a fine gentleman can't hide everything in his past. - You're a detective though and Nancy is paying you to come up with swarmy stuff like that? - Well, listen to this. (laughter) After Vincent found out that we saw him at the gardens, he went to the Count. He threatened to hurt Miss Nancy. - Did he? - Yeah, he did. That means somebody must've tipped him off and there was only one person Miss Nancy told that we were onto him. Ah, you get my drift now Mr. Christie, huh? - Very interesting speculation, Schindler. (laughter) - Well, let me come up a notch or two. You see I know the racket crowd pretty well. I was on the phone last night to Miami and New York. I got your number. - Well, what is my lucky number? - You're selling land to the mob. - Where do you think you are, in a pool room? - Now listen, stay away from Nancy, get that straight. - This cheap small time detective stuff is gonna find you in over your head. And I would suggest you get your grimy gumshoes off these islands of mine, before you find yourself stuck in them. - Just for the record, these aren't gumshoes. (pound loudly) Hey you go back and tell that Miami bastard, nobody touches Nancy. Nobody hurts her and I'm coming for you. - Get off my land! (footsteps pounding) - [Announcer] It's the greatest and busiest operation in military history. (upbeat music) The invasion of Sicily. Accepting the surrender of Mussolini's troops, General George Patton who leads the invading third army in what has been called the first page of the liberation of the European continent. - Our people did good, huh? Already I started making plans to make Sicily our new base of operations. What you like our first export from Sicily to be? - Heroin, it's the wave of the future. We are back in business. Just like the old days. - Um, not like the old days. - What you're talking about? Be sitting on a hell on a pile of dough. - Dirty money. The Feds'll get us the same way they got Capone. - Eh. - [Lansky] Tax evasion. - So we wash it in the Bahamas. - One spin of the wheel makes everything clean, huh? (laughter) (phones ringing) - Thank you sergeant. (footsteps tapping) (people talking) - What are you up to? - Oh, good evening Lieutenant. You know, I was just taking a look at this fine piece of Chinese craftsmanship that's gonna hang my boy. - It all comes back to that fingerprint. - Yeah. Yeah, but you know I'll tell you something. He said he grabbed the screen with his hand and yet there's only one fingerprint and it's his pinky. - Go back to New York, Mr. Schindler. - I'd like to do that Liutenant, I really would, but you know I'm a diligent employee. I tell you something though, this is one I can't figure out. - We all knew the Count was probably guilty. It's just too perfect to print. - Yeah, it's better than any I've seen. (instrumental music) It is too perfect, isn't it? - [Bailiff] All rise. Be seated. - [Judge] Mr. Higgs have you concluded your case? - No, my Lord I'm not quite yet finished. I ask that the witness be recalled. Captain James Barker. - [Bailiff] Call Captain James Barker. Captain James Barker. Captain James Barker. (footsteps tapping) - Captain Barker, you appreciate that you are still under oath? - Yes. - Captain, one hears such de-stressing stories about American police matters. I just that you treated my client with a courtesy throughout his examination. - Of course. - You did not for example, deprive him of a glass of water. - Glasses and water were right there on the table. - A glass is an excellent surface on which fingerprints can be found, is it not? - Sure, but there were no glasses at the murder scene. - What's he getting at now? He's onto something. - Where is the background? - The what? - The background texture on the screen. - I'm sure your rubber method would've lifted an impression of the background texture from beneath the fingerprint. (crowd whispers) Take your time, no hurry. - Not necessarily. - You lied about finding that fingerprint on the screen, didn't you? - I don't know what you're talking about. - Why did you lie? Is it because you're an ambitious policeman greedy for a conviction? - I didn't lie! - Or is it because somebody paid you to frame my client? Well, what is it? Why did you lie? - Counsel is badgering the witness. The court has already ruled on the admissibility of exhibit J. - My Lord, this fingerprint is the most critical issue in this case and I beg you, I beg you to allow me to apply a test to its validity. - What kind of test? - I ask that you direct Captain Barker to lift another fingerprint from the screen. - [Mr. Adderley] Objection! - You wish to see whether or not the background texture shows through? - Yes my Lord. If it does, the case against my client is clearly manufactured. - And if it doesn't show through, you'll be taking quite a chance, Mr. Higgs. So directed. The court will take a short recess to allow Captain Barker to bring his equipment here. (crowd talking) (footsteps tapping) - What are you doing here? - Mr. Schindler explained everything to me. - What does that mean? - Vincent won't bother anybody anymore. (doorknob turns) (soft music) (instrumental music) (throat clearing) (whispering lightly) - Captain Barker, can you explain why exhibit J is so neat and clean without markings? Whereas my Lord's fingerprint, shows quite clearly the impression of the texture of that screen? (crowd whispering) - No I can't. - I beg your pardon. - No, I can't. - I put it to you Captain Barker, that exhibit J does not come from that screen. - It does so. - I put it to you that you have fabricated evidence. - You're crazy. - I put it to you that it came from a clear glass which Mr. de Marigny handled while being questioned by you the day after Sir Harry's murder. - You can't prove it! - Captain Barker, the law regarding perjury is most severe. - Captain Barker, I will ask you again, did you fabricate evidence? - I deny it, I deny it. - Deny it all you wish, sir. - And that my Lord, gentlemen of the jury, this case is left to the defense. (crowd talking) - [Bailiff] Be seated. - The prisoner will rise. Members of the jury, are you all agreed upon your verdict? - We are. - Do you find the prisoner, Alfred de Marigny guilty or not guilty? - Not guilty, my Lord. (crowd gasps) (instrumental music) - Alfred de Marigny, you are hereby discharged and are free to leave this court. (crowd applause) (instrumental music) (crowd yells) - [Voiceover] He's free! (instrumental music) (engine blaring) (footsteps tapping) - I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. - That's all right. (instrumental music) - Who killed my father? - Who killed Sir Harry? The real question is, why was he killed? I was always trying to figure out a motive for the murder. Obviously, if Vincent and Mr. Christie can get your father out of the way, they can change the gambling laws and build their casinos. - Christie wouldn't kill my father. He was his friend. - You're right. Mr. Christie loved money, but he was no killer. And Vincent, the mob would never let Vincent hit Sir Harry. That's all the excuse the Feds would need to put Luciano away forever. - What about the boat? The boat that Edgar saw. The men that went up to the house? - Ah, the men never went up to the house. - But Edgar said that-- - I know what Edgar said, but see what I think happened was this. (thunder crashing) It was a terrible storm that night. I believe Howard Christie talked your father into going down to the dock. Mike Vincent was waiting there for him. He had to convince Harry to change his mind about the gambling he wants. Now Vincent knew the bosses wanted to be above suspicion, so he couldn't kill your father, but he decided to do the next best thing. To scare the hell out of him. I think something must've gone wrong. The boat pitched in the rough seas. Sir Harry fell hitting his head on the metal cabin treads. It was over in an instant and now there was no turning back. - Are you saying that this was an accident? - That's right, a freak accident. That's when I think a spontaneous crime committed on the spur of the moment. - How can you prove that? - It's only one way to do that? - Mr. Christie would have to tell us what he knows. - It'll never happen. - You're right, because that would make him an accomplice. You see, he had to go along with Vincent. He had to do that and pretend that he was asleep in that next room while your father was being murdered. (thunder crashing) They took the body back to Westborn. You see, it had to appear that Sir Harry had been murdered in his sleep. So they dressed the corpse in fresh night clothes which Samuel had put out. (thunder crashing) (ominous music) Then they found a blunt instrument which could cover up the head womb that Sir Harry had suffered in the boat. (hard pounding) (blood squishing) And to hide any possible mistakes, they created an appearance of a voodoo murder. The islands were already in a turmoil so it was a logical coverup. (footsteps tapping) (liquid splashing) (ominous music) There would be no clues. (fire cracking) Only the charred corpse, that perfect balance. You just happen to be the perfect patsy, Count. (breathing lightly) (footsteps tapping) - Gonna give me a call, Mikey? - What are you doing here? You gave me quite a surprise. - You've given me a few yourself. (laughter) - Yeah, sure. You know I was just gonna call ya. I've been working with Christie. - [Mr. Lansky] Good. - Yeah, and we're gonna get that casino built for ya. - You didn't follow orders. - Yeah, but everything worked out. - Oh yeah, yeah sure Patton's in Messina and we just won the war for Mr. Roosevelt. (laughter) - Everything worked out. - Our organization needs discipline. - Oh yeah, right. - [Mr. Lansky] Order. - Yeah, absolutely. - Guy doesn't follow orders, gotta square accounts. - Wait, Mr. Lansky. - Lucky said to tell you we owe you a line. - Well, wait a minute. Mr. Lansky, Mr. Lansky! You gotta explain, listen to me. (door slams) I... Please! (gunshot fires) - Major Nicholls says those American detectives fabricated evidence. - London will assume you told them to frame de Marigny. - Churchill will never trust me again. - We have to go back. - de Marigny, he's done this to me. He may be acquitted of murder, he's not a quitter of me. (soft music) - Funny, you think that's funny. Wasn't so funny when I was there. - Did you really know about (mumbles). - Your presence here is in rather poor taste major. - I'm merely a messenger. For what it's worth, I'm sorry. - What is it? What does it mean, you're invited to leave the Bahamas. - [Mother] What? - Means they're deporting him. - The Duke can do that? - Yes, when the war time pass he can. - It says here, the jury recommended it. - We'll fight it. I won't let the Duke take you down with him. (soft music) - We're not gonna fight it, are we? - Do you want to? - No. We have each other. It's been too much pain for us here. - Where do we go? - It doesn't matter, does it? (instrumental music) (crowd yells and dances) (drums beating) (men talking) - You think your revolution still has a chance? - This is our land. I can still teach my people, Count. - I just think from now on it may not be land Dr. Gordon, you know? It might only be real estate. (tap lightly) - Why don't you come with us? (laughter) - No, no I'm staying here, this is my world. Your dad's world. Do you know where you'll go? - Canada, Cuba, I'm not sure. - Will you let me know when you get there? (laughter) - I love you. - I do too. (soft music) (water splashing) (Multicom Jingle)
