Mr. Jefferson, the visitor you were expecting, has come. You're as exciting as always, Leila. But let's get the business over first. I'm glad you agreed to sign the contract as solo dancer. Only because I love you and trust you. - Here. All you have to do is sign. You'll get a replacement for me with a Las Vegas girl? - Of course! That's what I promised. Chin, chin! - Chin, chin! And now... that we've gotten rid of the business, let's get down to pleasure. For Mr. Jefferson. - Give me. But, I'm to hand it over to him in person. - He asked us to take the cues for him. He doesn't want to be disturbed tonight anymore. Anything else? I didn't know they came that small. Archie! - You're mine. Good evening. This is Edgar Wallace speaking. And don't forget, Sir Arthur. You've got to go on blowing, or it won't be stiff. You'll get a soft green mess. The whole effort will have been in vain. But how long do I have to go on blowing? - Just as I said, until it's quite stiff. Then you pour the foam over the omelette and serve while still warm. You wanted to dance with me, Sir Arthur. - Can't you see I'm busy now, Mabel. A new cooking recipe I was just given. - Cooking is really a wonderful hobby. It's much more thankful than sex. - But only when I'm serving the dessert! Every time she mentions the word "dessert" there's a telephone call for me! Sir, London Club. One moment, please. You're quite right. It's for you, Sir Arthur. Thank you. Hello? Yes. Aha! Yes. At once. Are we going to dance or aren't we? - Calm down, don't be so greedy. Softy, you'll represent me while I'm away. I'm sure Mabel's alright in your care. No, I wouldn't be too sure of that. No woman's really safe when I'm around. All I can say is it's very fortunate that you reached me when you did. I always like to be the first at the scene of a crime. What's going on here? Are you quite mad? You can't simply carry away the corpse before I could... search the place for traces of the crime. What amateur is fiddling around here? I'm afraid it's only me, Sir Arthur. - Perkins! How is it you're here already? Just a coincidence. Unfortunately someone got here before I did... and took the murdered man's belongings. I found a glass eye in his pyjamas. In his pyjamas? - Maybe he wanted to read a murder story. I see. Who was the murdered man? - Mr. Jefferson, one of our best guests. See to it that the press doesn't find out. The reputation of our hotel is at stake. Poppycock! A hotel that can't boast a murder in London nowadays, belongs to the second category. - The murderer's weapon, Sir Arthur. Did Mr. Jefferson receive a lady tonight? - Yes. Did you know the lady personally? - Yes. Is that all you can say? - Yes. Your vocabulary is limited to "yes" and "no"? - Yes. Yesterday evening a bag of billiard cues was delivered for Mr. Jefferson. So the murdered man was a billiard player? Was the subject of billiards discussed? No. I'm not interested in billiards. - What time did the lady leave the hotel? I'm afraid I didn't see her leave. - What did she look like? I'm also not interested in women. - You can make an exception this time. If you strain yourself, you might help us. - You could describe her as being pretty. Fur coat, medium quality, calf-skin. Medium sized. Long, blonde hair. Hey, you wanna get pinned to the board, Miss Leila? You got to be grateful to turn up at all! You'll get a fine for this! Sorry. Say, what's between you and Stoke? He asked for you. He seemed pretty mad. With Stoke? Just a fit of jealousy. I must talk to you! What's the matter? - Not now. Good evening, lovely girls! May I introduce myself? I am Rubiro, flame-swallower and knife-thrower. Internationally renowned. Don't bother. We know you only too well. Mr. Stoke? - What is it? Please see to it that we don't get molested. There's really no reason... why this man should be in our room. - I don't want you in their dressing room! Where have you been all night again? - You filthy louse! You wait. We're going to have a little chat after the dress rehearsal. Isn't it permitted to introduce oneself to one's new colleagues? You've done it twice already! - They're not the kind of colleagues... you're used to. These are The Las Vegas Girls, internationally famous. Guest appearances on the best stages and in the best beds. Shut up, you stupid idiot! - You let him speak to me in that tone? You can't go on living without your doll anymore, huh? I can't stand his mug anymore! - And that goes for me too, Rubiro! Have you both gone crazy? Stop it! You can fight anywhere you want, but not here in the theatre! Stoke, dress rehearsal in 5 minutes. If that happens once more, you'll both get fired! I'll see to it. Daddy! Come on, kids. Hurry up! Hurry up! - On stage, everybody! Oh! - You need a personal invitation, Leila? Come on! - Come on! Hurry up, Leila! Leila! Philadelphia, 1966. Jefferson alias Bradley, dealer in white slavery. Sydney, 1967. Wanted for white slavery. - Always girls behind it. How does he do it? - You say January '68 he was in London? January '68 he was in prison in Boston. However did he manage to do that? He's taken that little secret with him. A post-mortem examination won't reveal it! The fingerprints, found on the weapon. - What's going on here? You found them on the murder weapon? - Yes, Sir. Perkins, what are you waiting for? Have the man arrested immediately! Well, Sir Arthur, you're under arrest. - Come, come now! We're on duty. No fun and games, please! - Sorry, but only your fingerprints... are found on the weapon. - To show you how careful you must be! Smith? Back to work! Why are you smiling? - I'm sorry, Sir. The longer the hair, the stupider you get! - But, Sir Arthur, think of Einstein. Einstein only grew his hair to play the violin, and he was bad at that. The drawing corresponds to the clerk's description. - No one talks to me! Oh yes. Maybe you know the lady. Did you ever meet her? Unfortunately not. - Pepper? You need a lot of money for such a girl. That's not exactly my strong point! Well then, we'll have to search. You'll find out if this ring was stolen... or bought in London by tonight. - And what am I to do the rest of the day? That is entirely up to you. - This little present is a token of thanks for a wonderful night spent together with you that I'm still longing for! And this is a token of thanks for the cheap joke you've made once too often. We're dealing with a case of murder here, not a case of loving! - No, Sir. Perkins here. What? I'll be with you at once. Quick, Pepper! Never mind the ring now! May I ask what this call was all about? After all, you were using my telephone. One of the Las Vegas Girls was killed! Her death means a lot to you, does it? - We were good friends. Stupid idea to cover those lovely girls' faces with a mask. Look at this! Have you gone mad? You saw her face! Do you want to get poisoned? With the mask over your face you stick these 2 poisoned needles into your skin. Where did she come from? - Stockholm. Did she have relatives or friends here? - Just her friend, an American. She met him when he was visiting Paris. He followed us all the way here. Pepper, get the man here. What's his name? Where does he live? Mr. Archibald Jefferson. Palace hotel. - Chief! That's... - Forget it! I thank you. You're a great help to us. You can rest now, but don't go away. We'll probably need you again later on. Get rid of the crowd. Please go outside! Remember, the murderer always returns to the scene of a crime! He might be among you now! That goes for you, too. So Leila Anderson was the unknown girl with Mr. Jefferson yesterday evening... and was there when the murder took place. - She'd have preferred to go without. Yes. Bring this mask to the lab, and search her room very carefully. Aye, aye, Sir. My goodness! You drive like the devil! If you keep going on like this, we'll get into the next Monte Carlo rally! - But I don't have a driving license! What? - I'm short sighted, don't you know? I always mistake the break for the accelerator. I failed the exam 3 times! If I would have known that! Wait a minute. This won't take long now. The corridor to your left! - Thank you. Nobody is to leave the theatre! All men on the stage, all the women to me! How many knives do you have? - Twelve. Can I have a look? No, I say... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. - You're right! And where's the twelfth? - Somebody must have stolen it. No! Yesterday you killed somebody with it! - Mr. Rubiro and his new assistant... were rehearsing on this stage until 4 am. - She's probably an accomplice. Yes, that's what it is! Arrest him! - Although we would be more than delighted if Rubiro were to be arrested. Unfortunately we cannot deny the fact... that he spent the night here, rehearsing. - So you can bear witness to that? Yes, Sir. - And you? And I can confirm that too, Sir. My name is Stoke. I'm the stage manager. You may have a good alibi, but it makes you all the more suspicious! And why were you here until 4 am, too? - I was repairing my puppets. Your dressing room is beside that of the Las Vegas Girls? What has that got to do with the murder at the Palace hotel? The girl who was in Jefferson's room yesterday was found in the... Las Vegas Girls' dressing room, murdered. - Las Vegas Girls? I'd forgotten that! I want to see all the Las Vegas Girls! - All the Las Vegas Girls, report backstage to Sir Arthur at once! I don't want anybody to confirm my alibis. Understand? See, Daddy? That's all the thanks you get for trying to help someone. Now, I'll ask you a simple question. All you have to do is answer... with a simple "yes" or "no". Which one of you ladies has seen the murderer? Sir Arthur means, have you seen anyone in the theatre who doesn't belong here? I expressed myself clearly enough! - More than enough, Sir Arthur. Just look at that sweet little thing over there, raising her leg. I believe she wants to tell me something. - Why don't you question her in your car? You'd be undisturbed there. - My car! That's what I'd forgotten. What's going on here? Stop it at once, I say! Your new assistant? What's her name? - Oh, yes. What is your name? Miss Finley! - You may carry on. Mabel! Stop this at once! Mabel, my dear! Are you alright? It's terribly exciting! Each time I found one of those pointed things flying at me, I had to think of you, Sir Arthur. - How delightful! Thank you. You may go back to your dressing rooms, but please don't go away. I might need you again. Bruce! - I must speak to you! Be careful! The police are searching the place. One of our girls was murdered. That doesn't affect me! When do I see you? - Bruce, I told you it isn't any use. Please. In all these years too much has happened. Look at that! She hasn't been in London one week yet and got a sweetheart already. What is it you want? You can't get rid of Snooky as easily as you can of a young dancing girl. Snooky only speaks the truth. And you can't kill the truth. Isn't that so, Snooky? - Yes, Daddy. Bruce! - Get out! Come! Come to the hotel later on. I'll wait for you in the bar. There just isn't any point. Oh yes. Let's start all over again. You're no longer the same person, so nervous, restless. Are you in trouble? After you disappeared... Those first months, they were the worst for me. For me, too. - I want to know why you went away. There was simply no other way. - My question was why! Bruce! It's a thing of the past. Let's not talk about it anymore. Yes? Alright. We'll start all over again. - I can't go on being the mysterious... mistress of a rich man, can I? - I don't want you to. I love you! You said that last time, too. But your mother will be as much against a marriage as she would have been last time. - I'm no longer dependent on her! I want to introduce you to her. - Bruce, I... Excuse me, Lord Sharringham. Your mother's on the telephone. Excuse me for a moment. I'll just tell her that I'll telephone her afterwards. A little surprise: The entire belongings of Ms. Anderson were picked up one hour ago from her boarding house by a uniformed chauffeur. But listening to the clerk's description of him, my impression is that his memory had been purchased for 5 pounds, or so. The room was cleaned out, except for this. It was under the wastepaper basket. It's a ticket to a billiard club in Soho. Do you play billiards? - I can say that I am for billiards... what you are for The Yard. - You must be very good. You can prove it! Not bad at all. - I quite agree. Have you marked it down, Miss? - Yes, Sir. Safety first, I say. Now, let's have a go! Fifteen! Now, how much more do I need? Another twenty. Now, keep your eyes open for the shot of the day! Well? - Congratulations. How about a rematch? Gladly. I just want to pick up my winnings. I bet five pounds on myself, at ten to one. That makes fifty pounds for me! This way, Sir. He's winning too much, that boy. He should play billiards somewhere else. He looks suspiciously like a cop to me. Look him up on our card file. Ok, boss. Scotland Yard? - Where else do you think? Here he is. Jim Pepper, Sergeant. 26 years old, five feet seven, brunette. Assistant of Inspector Perkins. - Cops rarely come alone. We'll have to expect a surprise visit sometime soon. Just because of Jefferson we're stuck now. - I'd like to know who it was. I mean, who it was who killed Jefferson. The whole thing smells fishy to me. Then we'll have to clear that smell away. Make sure everything's cleared away here. By tomorrow morning the room upstairs has to be clean! - Ok. Here, Sir. 50 pounds. Close table three. - I'll see to it at once, Sir. Well, then! Now we can continue. - No, thanks. Not tonight. Maybe some other time. - But you just said... How about you? I was informed just now that the table was reserved for a tournament game. Can't be helped then. Here you are, Miss. Rather unpleasant what took place in your theatre. Have the police got anywhere? There were many people there at that time. It'll be difficult to find the culprit. All the same, unpleasant! - You can't reproach an innocent person... for being there when she was murdered. - As long as the killer isn't found, everyone is considered suspect. - Is it my fault the murder took place... in the theatre? Could have been anywhere! - Exactly. It would have been much better for you. Yes? Put him through. Donovan. Ah, Mr. Donovan. What can I do for you? I quite understand. Yes, I happen to have someone from the theatre in my office. I think he'll be able to arrange it for you. Of course. My pleasure. Mr. Donovan is having a party tonight and would be very grateful... if it were possible to arrange for two of the Las Vegas girls to appear. Well, I don't know... - There is nothing to know. His car will be waiting at the stage door after the performance. Rubiro, you're on stage in one minute. Hurry up. The car's waiting for you. - We'll be ready in a minute! Enjoy yourselves! - Next time you have an invitation... for one of the girls, think of me, Eric. Fancy man! - Shut up, you! What's going on here again? Hurry up! Get on stage! You come on right after Rubiro. If you please. Sounds like the people are enjoying it. - Mr. Donovan enjoys giving parties. May I show you the way? - It's lovely here! It is specially built for the convenience of his guests. Mr. Donovan's awaiting you. Look at that! Strange reception, I must say. - Now we know we're really in England. The richer the people, the more peculiar their whims. Welcome to my party, ladies. My name's Donovan. It might seem somewhat crazy, but I always give parties like this. Please sit down. What can I offer you? Champagne, whisky, rice wine? Anything your heart desires. Mr. Donovan, are we to understand that we are the only guests? I'm quite sure you're going to enjoy the evening. Won't you sit down, please? I'd like to make things quite clear right now. We were invited to a social gathering, and not to a private party... at which one man would entertain us. - Don't be a spoilsport. Have a drink. We have a couple of things to discuss. I admired you two ladies on stage. I was very impressed. I'd like to offer you a contract at once. You know very well we are under contract with the Las Vegas Girls. We don't intend to break our contract. - You've already broken your contract. You're with me! Come on, Linda! Mr. Donovan, please let us out of here at once! That's the only way out I can offer you, I'm afraid. But you'd have to be... very good mountaineers. - What is it you want from us? I want you to stay with me for a few days. You'll have everything you need. But you mustn't play any tricks. - But we've got a performance every night! That's the point, dear girls. I don't want you to perform. Why don't you want us to be in the show? I mean, what's the point of it all? Careful, Leslie. Don't argue with him. I'm quite sure the man's crazy. Donovan. We think the cops are going to snoop around the club. Don't take any risks. Don't worry. Tell the boss everything's going according to the plan. You can do what you want with the girls. Hand them over to Ray and Clark. I don't want them to appear! It's got to be the end of the troop this week. You can depend on me, boss. You know that, don't you? How could that happen, you damned idiots? It really wasn't our fault, boss. When we got to the swimming pool... he was dead, and the girls had gone away. - Gone away? Did you hear that? I've got no idea how the roof was open. They must have climbed out. The girls are gone and you stand around! - Well, we thought that... I don't want you to think! Ray and Clark, I want you to get the girls here before the police get them. Ok, boss. - And alive! I want to speak to Inspector Perkins. - Yes, speaking. In Arlington a man was just murdered, a Mr. Donovan. Hello? Hello! We've been cut off! - I'm still here. And who are you? My name is Linda Svenson. I'm one of the Las Vegas Girls. And where are you now? - At a Motel: Prince of Wales. Don't let anyone in until I get there. - No. Hello, darling. Are you ready to leave? - My relief will be coming, sweetie pie. I'm afraid we're booked out for tonight. - Scotland Yard. Oh, my gosh! Good heavens! - What is it? It's 3 am, you know? Do you know if these girls live here? - Yes, yes. That's Linda and Leslie. Are they upstairs? - Fussy one for details, aren't you? Never mind the jokes, baby. Well? - Twelve. Got no sense of humor, those cops. A pity, they were quite cute otherwise. Sweetie pie! - I was just joking. Here's a cup of tea. Who's there? - Scotland Yard. Come in. That was quick. Did Inspector Perkins come with you? Inspector Perkins wants you to come to his office. Please get ready to come along. - Alright. Ok, let's go. This way. Scotland Yard. I want to speak to Miss Linda Svenson! Two of your men are already up there. - From Scotland Yard? 5 minutes ago they went up there. - One word out of either one of you, and you're both dead! Is there another way out of here? - Just the fire escape. Goodness! Does this happen every night? - That's women for you. They went through my room. Over the fire escape. Stop at once, or I'll shoot! Let go of the girls! You hear? Come out of there! You don't expect me to believe that cock and bull story, do you? But it's true, Inspector! - You've got a wonderful imagination! The murderer threw the knife from above! - Now you're repeating yourself. You told me that already. A man with a glass eye, you said? We're two witnesses! - And it was this knife? Yes! He threw the knife with a red handle. - Sorry, I'll have to keep you here... under suspicion of murder. Smith? Bring them downstairs. I want them detained. - We've got a performance tonight! I don't. I've got to find a murderer, and that's more important. If you please. You want these two locked up? Why, they're as innocent... as two new born babes! - I believed every word those girls said. Chief? Now I'm really completely lost. - Switch on your extra computer. When Jefferson was murdered, Leila, the dancer, was with him. What happened to her? - Some person put poison in her veins. Donovan invited Leslie and Linda. If they'd have telephoned me 5 min later, I'd have been too late. - Does he want to break up the troop? Leila was murdered. If two more were to disappear, soon the whole company... couldn't go on anymore. - Fabulous! Now you can have a drink. Chief, if I'm allowed to have a drink, it's either that you're sick, or I've been talking a lot of nonsense. - I want you to see to it that these girls are treated like queens. I'm going to have a talk with that ventriloquist and Rubiro. And don't empty the whole... Forget it. I was certain that you still loved me, Nora. I told you not to call me Nora. - Why not? You are Nora Wilson, the girl I love, that I always loved. Bruce... Forget that name, I beg you. I'm Yvonne Duvalle, even for you. Nora Wilson is gone forever. - Ok. You're Yvonne, my Yvonne. When will you introduce me to your mother? Soon. - You promised. Don't forget. Go. They mustn't see you here! Who is it? - Eric. I have to tell you something. I've only got to slip something on! This sneaky man mustn't see you here. Come this way. Yes, yes, I'm coming! You are alone? - As you can see. But I heard someone else talking to you. A man's voice, I'm quite sure of it. You didn't have to send your visitor down the fire escape just because of me? What was so important it couldn't wait? - I'm sorry, I've no news for you. But I would very much like to talk to Nora Wilson. What do you think, Snook y? Could this be the Nora Wilson that stayed in South America for such a long time? Nora Wilson, Nora Wilson, Nora Wilson! Get out! Wouldn't it be better for you if we talked about it? Get out! Oh daddy! Hello there, Inspector! What can I do for you? Has Eric come in yet? - He won't be in for an hour, at least. I'll wait. Where's his dressing room? - Number 26. Another question. Where are the knives? - There. Right behind you. 8, 9, 10, 11! - What's the matter? Nothing. Idiot! That's the police, Chief. Unmistakable family resemblance! - Yes, indeed. Very cozy, I must say. Chief! Mr. Nuthacher? - Look around, and see if you find... anything that might interest you. The coffin has to be ready by noon. A surprise for someone's mother-in-law? - This is for the window... of Poppies' Funeral Services. He believes he will get more customers... if people see how comfortable they lie in his coffins. Why did you do that? - Ever met him? Why, that's Snooky. Anything wrong with him? Snooky's alright. But daddy isn't feeling too well, he's been murdered. Pity, one good customer fewer. - Did you make this head? Mr. Nuthacher? Eric designed it. There are the cues, Mr. Nuthacher. Chief? I saw that young boy in the billiard club. Detain him and wait for me in my car. Thank you. After you, Sir. Did you also deliver some repaired cues to the Palace hotel for a Mr. Jefferson? Of course. He was murdered the same night. I went to pick up the cues the next day, but you'd already taken them away. - What do you have to do... in the billiard club to get in the room? - Each one of us has his secret password. I want you to line up 8 tough boys from the police school for tonight. Miss Finley, please. Perkins here. Have you any idea where the billiard cues, held in the Jefferson case, are now? - Sir Arthur is using them at the moment. Sir Arthur? Ok, telephone him. Tell him we're coming to the house. But why? He is playing billiards here. - We'll join you at once. I don't want you to mention to anyone what we've been talking about! Don't worry about it. You've got more important things to think about. Can I get out now? - Ok. Stop. Hello, boss. Is that you? Dick speaking. I want to talk to the boss, I said. Yeah, what is it? What's so important? - I've got interesting news for you... for 10 pounds. - I'll pay if it's important enough. About 8 cops are coming to the club later. - How did you get to hear that? Private connections. Inspector Perkins is a very good friend of mine. You must let it glide delicately through your fingers. Don't tighten up! Relax. It's a wonderful instrument that you can play with carefully. Ready? Careful! Now! Fabulous! Phenomenal! Now we'll try the same position from the other side of the table. It's all very exciting! May I try alone? - Of course! 1... 2... 3! Look what I've done! - You must be more careful, Mabel! You can't play billiards wildly like that. And stop dribbling, will you? Perkins, the afternoon has been pleasant so far, and I don't want things to change! Are these the Jefferson cues? - Yes. They're terrible quality. You can take them back where you got them. They're falling to bits just by touching. This is a billiard cue, not a telescope! Really! I knew you were going to ruin... our afternoon... - Excuse me, Sir. Have a look at this. This is heroin, Sir Arthur. - No, thank you. I don't smoke. Heroin? Where did you get it? - From the cues of Jefferson. I must say, extremely tasty. - Now! Just see what you've done. Your fooling around will make a drug addict of her, yet! Put that away. Don't nibble! I need your consent for a search warrant for the billiard club The Glass Eye. What do you expect to find there? - Headquarters of a gang of dope peddlers, an organization dealing in white slavery. - Ms. Finley, could you make an appointment for the Inspector with a psychiatrist? - But these cues come from The Glass Eye! They were found with Jefferson! - But they were brought to him from there. By a boy whose club identification is a glass eye. We found a similar one... when Jefferson was murdered, on Donovan and on the ventriloquist. The Glass Eye is an internationally reputed club. Absolutely above board! They hold world championships there. - Anyway, we have sufficient grounds... to warrant a search of the premises! - Without me. Ok, without you! Is that your final word? - Yes, it is. The psychiatrist will see you in an hour. - Sir Arthur will go on my behalf. You can identify our men by the red ties we're wearing. We find something, I'm sure. Just look at the types, enough to fill the next prison. Look at that! What did I say? Perkins. Things will start in a minute. The 10 pounds were well spent on the boy, don't you think? You can say that again. Was that the guy? Yes. That's one of the two men that came to see me. Get me Scotland Yard. Sir Arthur. Your identification? - What? Oh, sorry. Good evening! I'm in bad need of repaired cues. Yours are alright. Why do you want them changed? I'll change them if you want. Here you are, Sir. - Thank you. What do I owe? You're a member, aren't you? It doesn't cost you anything. Oh, yes. Of course! Anything wrong, Mister? - These are not the cues I wanted. I'm sorry, Sir. We haven't any others. - Then give me mine again, will you? Those aren't mine. - They are yours, Mister. Get out. - Why be so unfriendly? I'm a member! Out! Get out! Chief, that's the work I love! Look there! What's the matter, Pepper? Carry on, my boy! Let me go out there. Just for 5 minutes. - Idiot! You'll be recognized. You naughty man! Chief! All the cues are made of solid wood. Not a single one is hollow. Don't give up. Keep on looking. - Aye, aye, Sir. Stop it! Stop it, I say! Please forgive us, gentlemen. It was all an unfortunate mistake. Ouch! Pepper! You're fired, right now! But really, he didn't do it on purpose. - Are you quite sure of that? I want everybody belonging to The Yard arrested at once! Now the police are arresting one another! Really wonderful how you went about it. I've got a few tricks up my sleeve. I want everything advanced by 2 days! Things are getting much too hot around here. Perkins won't give up until he's closed this place down. I know his type. Don't get nervous now, boss. - Who's getting nervous? Mice can be caught with the right bait. And I assure you, I'll have... two Las Vegas heroin mice by tomorrow. Nuthacher's the man for you. Step right in! Smile! Sergeant! For your lack of discipline I will now give you a piece... Miss Finley! Did you find out at what time Sir Arthur was telephoned yesterday evening? The exchange received the call at 20:03. - The phones were in our hands by then. There must be another room with a phone. - I'm quite convinced someone warned them. Some idiot must have made a mistake. - Two idiots! - Quite right. Inspector! Dick, the young errand boy you talked to, hasn't been seen for 2 days. I was afraid of that. Quick, Pepper, we need the cues he delivered Nuthacher. He's the man who can help us. What took you so long to get here? - Has the stuff been delivered? No. Things are getting too hot. The police were here. Did you talk? Nobody knows that we come here! - I'll give you another address. There you'll get your stuff. - But we need it now! - Come on. I don't want to lose on this affair. There's a truck in the backyard. The man knows all about it. There! You needn't worry. He's a good friend of mine. Come. Say, how far is it? - You want it real bad, don't you? It's none of your business! We pay for it! - Here. A sample for you. Mr. Nuthacher? Very pious to place the victim in the coffin. The murderer has a good aim. Every time right in the middle of the heart! There was a knife thrower in London who was well-known for his perfect aim. But 3 years ago he committed suicide. Come on! We've got to find the cues. Did you say something, Mr. Nuthacher? Chief! - What is it? He... he's gone! - But that's impossible! A coffin with a false bottom. Well, something new for a change. You see? No joy in heaven without one's luggage! That's enough out of you. What do you say to that, Pepper? - The glass eye. Seems also to have been a club member. - Yes. Our friend was going on a journey on the 29th. On the Olaf Ericsen to Caracas. He wasn't very poor, I see. Chief! Why, there's the Las Vegas Girls! Yes. What do you say to that? This girl and this are being detained by us. And Nuthacher's marked them "out". - We've got an important fish on the hook. A dead one. Forget the cues for now. This is a case of white slavery. Find out who the other girls are. I bet they're planning to send... the Las Vegas Girls to South America very soon. Where have you brought us? - To the 7th Heaven where you wanted to go! Let go! Let go of me! Let go! Let me go! Help! Please let me go! Open up! Let me go! All of the orders are carried out, boss. One of the best shipments we've ever had. You can cable Zeno in Caracas immediately. But in code. Ok. This evening the Las Vegas Girls don't go on. And, then... we're off. But Doris and Ann couldn't have vanished into thin air. I'm sure they'll turn up. Your act has been cancelled from tonight's program. The director's fining me... a fortune for this. - What's going to happen now, Mr. Parker? You'd better start looking for a new job. Come to my office tomorrow morning... with packed bags. - We don't sign every contract. You certainly don't have to pay. But then you have to give me in cash every penny... of the fine I have to pay for you. - How much is that for Yvonne? 1,000 pounds. Do you have it on you? Come on. Why don't I ever meet a man like this? I'll give you three guesses. Bruce, tell me why you did that. - You mustn't run away again. I... I want to marry you. - It's out of the question. Tomorrow we go and see my mother. She must get to know you. Thank you, Bruce. I'm sure now you're serious about us. Detailed description to be sent out at once! Chief, you were right as usual. The Karaokers, a foreign dance troop. Act cancelled 8 days ago in Liverpool. The Blue Dolphins, foreign dance troop. Act cancelled 4 days ago in Birmingham. The Las Vegas Girls cancelled yesterday evening. Next morning all had disappeared. Not 7, but 8 ships will sail out tonight. The Olaf Ericsen has announced to leave 2 days earlier than planned for Caracas. - 2 men with radio sets to the harbor! They're to observe the ship. Pepper, I want you to have the two detained... Las Vegas Girls brought to my office. - Yes, Chief. I want section 3, please. You're very lucky the police released you this morning. You got here just in time. When are we sailing? - You've got to be on board in one hour... because of customs and so. Here are the instructions on how to get your tickets. They've already been paid for? - It's not worth mentioning, kids. After all, I couldn't abandon you high and dry. John, drive out the car. We're extremely thankful to you. - You'll surely get a chance to repay me. Great idea you had there, to get those transmitters built in their shoes. You got them? - Yes, Sir. Switch on the receiver! There! How powerful are these transmitters? - Under normal conditions about 50 miles. The batteries last 24 hours. - Now they're moving into Denver Street. Does that ring a bell, Pepper? - That's where the billiard club is! So it's narcotics and white slavery, too. - Now we'll finish off the club, huh? You want to ruin everything? We want to get every single one. There are two more coming. Check out the customs seal. Here's another one. Let's go, will you? - Where are we? They're gone! - How can both of the transmitters stop? They were last seen on the corner of Liberty and Denver St. The billiard club! My car! Where's my mother? I want to talk to her! - Lady Sharringham doesn't want to be... I must talk to her! Call her. Tell her I insist on speaking to her! Very well, Sir. What is it, my dear boy? Good day, mama. - You're in difficulties? No. - Well, what do you want then? I want to introduce you to the girl I'm going to marry. Have you got another nightclub type? - She's not a nightclub type. She's a dancer. - I don't see the difference. When you get to know her you'll notice it. - We'd be wasting our time. I need some money as well. - But I gave you 1,000 pounds yesterday! I've spent it. Bruce... Better forget that girl, my boy. - She's here! I brought her with me. Here she is. This is Yvonne. My mother, Lady Sharringham. Leave us alone, Bruce. Go. Won't you sit down? - Thank you. Why are you wearing sunglasses? Are you hiding something behind them? Only my eyes. They're very sensitive. How much do you want? - What do you mean? I'll give you 2,000 pounds if you give me your word never to see my son again. You can save your breath. I won't give up Bruce for anything. And I know if he had to choose between you and me, he would choose me. I'll give you 3,000 pounds if you go away. - No. You're quite wrong if you're under the impression that Bruce loves you. He turns up every single month with some little girl. By next week he'll have forgotten you. - Nora Wilson as well? What do you know of Nora Wilson? - Bruce spoke to me about her. Where are you employed? - Is that important for your decision? You're a dancer. I'd like to know where. - I'm one of the Las Vegas Girls. Is that so? Las Vegas Girls? My advice to you is to leave England as quickly as you can. And why? If you really want to know, your love for my son will destroy you. Ms. Wilson wasn't destroyed by his love. - Nora Wilson ended in a brothel. How do you know that? Did you help to put her in there? Get out of my house. Get out of my house! We shall meet again, Lady Sharringham. Where's Yvonne? - She left. She doesn't want to see you! That isn't true! Why did she go? Why? - For 3,000 pounds. She went away forever. Bruce, they're just not worth it. You always let their lovely painted faces and innocent looking eyes deceive you. But believe me, they just aren't worth it. It's more than a pure coincidence. We've never had a better shipment... than we have on the Olaf Ericsen at this moment. Isn't it strange... that now all these people get murdered: Jefferson, Donovan, Nuthacher... I wonder who'll be next. The police maintain... it was a man with a glass eye that... - What are you trying to say? I only got rid of Leila and Eric. They both had to disappear. Or would you have preferred them to go to the police and sing? Can one of you tell me why Nora Wilson isn't a member of the troop on board? Nora Wilson? Who's that? - She now calls herself Yvonne Duvalle, a member of the Las Vegas Girls. Although she was, 5 years ago and according to my instructions, transported to South America. She was my son's mistress then. It's not our job to have to get rid of your little Bruce's mistresses! We did it once. That's enough. - How dare you talk to me like this! Now, listen. Yvonne Duvalle could denote great danger for us. You will make sure that she is brought on board. Do you understand? Yes, Milady. Boss, that's sheer madness! Inspector Perkins has telephoned 3 times to find out where the Las Vegas Girls are. You'll get her on board. With or without a contract. And by ten o'clock you'll be on the Olaf Ericsen. It's very quiet here. I've got a feeling the birds have flown. I wanna search the place inside out! - It's Sergeant Smith from the harbor. On the Olaf Ericsen the pilots are going on board. What shall we do? Pray! You start here! Give me that thing. - He tells you to pray. Just look who's here! Have you changed your mind? - Yes. I changed my mind after all. Give me back the 1,000 pounds you cashed on my behalf, and I'll sign. What? - What should I have done? Asked him to keep his money? - Congratulations. Very clever of you... Nora Wilson! How did you find out? - Did you think I'd believe that rubbish? First cash the cheque and then go on board like a good girl? You of all people, who's been through it all once before. No, my dear, that's not what we planned. We'll wait here, and at ten o'clock we'll go together to the Olaf Ericsen. The chief will be glad meeting you again. - Mr. Parker, you can't do that to me. Oh yes, I can. - You must believe me. Because of the money I came back to your office. Please don't make me go... through that ordeal once more. Please let me go. You want me to let you go? So you can run to the police? Stop what you're doing! Unlock the door at once! Cut out that nonsense, will you? You wouldn't dare to. You see, Mr. Parker. I do dare. Now, unlock the door, will you? Get out of the way! Perkins! Your behavior is absolutely improp... What are you doing there? The secret entrance to the next building. - What's that about the next building? I always maintained that there's no point in searching the billiard club. Yes, Sir. Pepper, Thompson, find out where this leads to. Perkins, I want to make it perfectly clear that everything that is going on here... is without my consent. - I won't forget, Sir Arthur. Found anything, Pepper? - Hey? Where are you, Chief? They've got TV, too. They aren't beginners. Smells of violence here. The Karaokers, The Blue Dolphins and The Las Vegas Girls have left autographs on the wall. "Help" is written underneath. - Alright. Come up here. Aye, aye, Sir. Perkins, would you be good enough to tell me what you're looking for? "Caracas, 18th of December. We confirm the conditions of acceptance are only valid if shipment of violets is intact and punctual. Zeno." I told you! Violets! I'm not interested in... - "Violets" is a code name for "girls". Why, every child knows that. - I'm not a child! You should know better. In Caracas they're expecting a shipment of violets and the Olaf Ericsen... is the only ship leaving for Caracas. So, off you go to the harbor! If the ship is about to sail, it must be stopped at all costs. There they are again! They've a different position. Sectional square, X 12. Headquarters for Inspector Perkins. - Perkins here. The signal's coming in again, from the harbor. About point 16. That's the Olaf Ericsen. Give the alarm! Hurry! We've got them, Sir. Parker's coming with one more girl. When he gets here, we can go. The chief is here. We've got to wait until you're finished before we can sail. Why? What's the matter? - I don't know. Is she on board? Well? I want to see her. Bring her down here! What are you waiting for? The ship will wait until I've spoken to her. I want to have the pleasure of telling her where she's going. I know where that is. You told me once before, you see. Here, at this very same spot, nearly 3 years ago! Nora Wilson. I see you obviously haven't forgotten. Forget that! We're going to have a little talk, all alone. You haven't got a chance. You're on board of my ship. Everyone obeys my orders! - You're wrong, Lady Sharringham. You're not giving any more orders. - Whatever makes you think that? You know very well how much I cared for Bruce. You also know how much Bruce cared for me. - You're quite right. What you went through, Nora Wilson, every girl will be forced to go through... who dares to take my son away from me. - Do you believe he'll still love you... when he finds out who you are? - He'll never find out! He already knows. And it was I who told him. Well... We can soon find out whom he'll believe: me, his mother, or a whore from some cheap brothel. - You're quite right, Lady Sharringham. Quite right. And you do know what a brothel is like, don't you? You know, but you still send hundreds of young girls into that hell! You're not worth a better fate! You think that with your pretty faces... you own the whole world! - You've ever seen one of them afterwards? After one year they're old women, wrecks. Their lives forever destroyed. You'll go through this once more. And you won't get away this time. Inspector? I'm Lord Sharringham! I've got a letter from Yvonne Duvalle. I'm to deliver it at ten o'clock to the harbor police. I studied your organization carefully. Then I went to work, and Martinez was the first to die. Your organization has been wiped out, Lady Sharringham. And you needn't expect Parker, by the way, he's dead. So is the boss. Now you're on your own. - And now you want to kill me, do you? No. You and I are going to be sent to prison for what we've done. For life. Why didn't you go to the police at once? - No one would have believed me. They might have sent one or two of your people to jail for a few years. But that wasn't enough. I wanted your organization destroyed. And that's what I've done. You're quite right. There's no way out for me while you're alive. But you're not going to live! It's all over, Lady Sharringham. See? What did I tell you, Bruce? It would never work out. Forgive me, Bruce. She was innocent, Inspector. She killed, but she was innocent. I only found out today what she'd been through. There's only one guilty person here. My own mother. Go on, shoot. Why don't you shoot at last? You let Nora Wilson and many others go through hell. Why should you have it any more easily? Just finish off what you started. Reynolds? Look after him. - Yes, Sir. Brown? - Yes, Sir? Anthony Wilson was the best knife thrower in the business. His daughter, Nora, worked as his assistant. 3 years ago, after she disappeared without a trace, Wilson committed suicide. You see this, here? When I saw this on the knife... with which Nuthacher was murdered, I knew it was Nora Wilson we were looking for. I could think of no motive until today. When I learned that Yvonne Duvalle... was none other than Nora Wilson. - She committed 5 murders. Yes, but several hundred girls would very gladly build a memorial for her, if they knew of the terrible ordeal they had been spared through Ms. Wilson. Lady Sharringham! Makes one want to drop one's title. The girls, where are they? - In the engine room. Released? - Not yet. Just typical! I've got to do everything myself! I've waited for this moment a long time. - You can be grateful you're not bald... like Sir Arthur. You'd be a dead man! - No time for jokes now! Scotland Yard! My dear ladies, you are free! Please, ladies! Please! I was only doing my duty! Thank you, thank you. What a man! - What a woman! The very idea of your... going to Caracas and what might have happened brings the blood to my head. Only when you think of Caracas, Sir? - You'd better wait in my car. Why, just look at that old peacock! He couldn't make it if she helped him. What did you say? - He meant to say you'll make it up. Up, right up. I mean, The Yard. - This is the first time... I won't contradict you, my dear Perkins. I'm afraid duty calls. See to everything here, will you? The End
