People of the Earth, for the first time since heroically rescuing Toki Wartooth... Dethklok! Oh, yeah! I'm fucking back, motherfuckers! I'm fucking back! Welcome back. Your fans demanded that you rescued your brother, and you did it. So we have these fans to thank for all of this. We do? Fuck yeah! And fuck you all! Well, we're glad to see you, and, you know, for a minute there, we weren't sure we'd ever see you again. Well, you're fucking wrong as shit, you fucking dipshit. Well, uh, yeah. It's been a... Well, it's been a long time since you put out a record. -Here we go. Here we go. -Here we go. Your absence in the global marketplace could cause some economic catastrophes if you don't-- Shut up. Shut your trap. Just shut-- Close your mouth. I'm gonna tell you something. We have a three-point plan to get new Dethklok into your fucking ears, and mouth, and faces. Number one, today, we're announcing a world tour! Number two, then we're making a new record! That's the plan. We planned it out. Uh, so what's three? -What? -The third one? I meant a two-point plan. Still, though. -Still. -Well, I'd like to shift gears. Toki, tell us about being rescued by your own band after being abducted. Well, I can't. Not really. Just that Toki is happy to be back with his brothers. Don't touch. But I'll tell you, it's weird. One second, we're looking for Toki, the next thing, we got Toki with us and nobody remembers anything. Well, actually, Nathan, you remember some stuff, right? Nathan? What? Yeah, we're just happy to have Toki back with us so we can fuck this place up with some fucking metal. Well, I'd like to talk about Magnus Hammersmith. What a tragedy. How does it feel knowing that a former bandmate was not only responsible for the abduction, but also took his own life? Well, uh... It's a real tragedy, but, you know... Hey, we're just ready to get back out there and start kicking ass. Crypto is crashing. Velocity of money is going to zero. The markets are plunging. We're in a liquidity crisis. Nathan Explosion cannot recapture what Dethklok once was. When was their last record? The right thing to do would be to step aside or just quit. Don't leave the audience hanging. Let the world move on. What about post-traumatic stress? They say Nathan Explosion has been in the medical ward at Mordhaus. Well, I'm sure they're filling him full of drugs and pampering him like a rich celebrity. What about their longtime manager CFO Charles Offdensen dropping out and becoming some kind of a spiritual kook? It's not just the religious fanatics worried on this Doomstar, it's also NASA scientists. Did you know that Dethklok has their own army? They have somewhere in the neighborhood of 60,000 armed troops all working for Dethklok. Well, I'll tell you what the whole thing is about. Nathan Explosion's inaction. Dethklok's army, the economy in crisis, everything. It's all about fear! Fear. Fear. Fear. Hey, target hit! But the star is still too far away! Payload chewed up by atmospheric degradation. No matter. The beast was expendable. Farewell, sister of the krakish. To my loved ones... I give you a grave warning. A monumental evil will take this planet. Consider this my confession. I unwittingly helped to bring about the end of the world. I was forced into compliance, possessed. I have lost control of my actions, thanks to a man whom I fear. A beast, not of this Earth. Take this and deliver it to my family. Let no one know about it. The only reason I can give this warning is because my captor is in the stages of possessing another. Who? I do not know. This will be the last you will hear from me. With love and regret. You don't appreciate our endeavor? Shame. Traitors. This you must own, General. You know better. We still have plans for you. Yes. Take not advantage of my kindness, General. And to the rest of you, there is still work to be done. I must rest and collect strength. Much could go wrong. We're concerned about the threat of this Army of the Doomstar, "The Song of Salvation," and Charles Offdensen. He's become studious in the annals of the Metalocalypse. He, too, is a danger. Which is why I will bathe in his blood. He must die by my hands. Grant me this, Lord. Find and destroy the Army of the Doomstar and stop Nathan Explosion from writing "The Song of Salvation." And Offdensen will be your reward. Fucking ugly fucking star. Just fucking sitting there. I like it. It's like a big cigarette burning your eye. Tell him to fucking stop. All right, come on, we gotta go. We are the gears in the wheel of the clock. We fear not our mortality. We will serve to the best of our ability. We are the gears. Praise blackness. One of us has died. His name was Ishnifus Meaddle. High holy priest of the Church of the Black Klok. He devoted his life to understanding the prophecy, a puzzle he sought to solve with all its fragmented-- Die, motherfucker, die! Jesus! Fuck! Murderface, put that away and show some respect. Pickles, I have to go tinkles to the bathroom. You just went. I want Nathan to take me to the bathroom. Nathan isn't coming, you know. I texted him. Just shut up for a little bit, okay? I don't like that. Fuck! Pickles, I hate church! Can't I at least wait in the car? If I have to be here, then you have to be here. Well, you can't tell me what to do, because you're not my fucking mother! Oh! Watch the language. He left this unforgiving world with-- Excuse me. Well, you are not excused. That was deliberate. Toki, don't lick the puke. Come on! Oh, great. Here we go again. -Toki's always in trouble! -Okay, all right. No, you're not. Just watch out for germs. Sorry. You know, Toki's a little sensitive these days. We think he's regressing from, uh, you know, the whole thing. Skwisgaar, take your brother to the bathroom. Go. Go on. -Do I have to? -Yes. Get off of me. Don't touch Skwisgaar. Take your brother to the bathroom. Make sure he washes his hands. And you too. And you too, Skwisgaar. I heard you. God! You watch it. I will smack you. No, you won't. No, you won't. You just... Why are we fighting? What are we doing here? Your presence is requested by Father Offdensen. We are the gears in the wheel of the clock. We fear not our mortality. We will serve to the best of our ability. I'm having a hard time wrangling those fucking dickweed fuckheads. You know what I mean? Pickles, Dethklok is about to be challenged in ways you don't know. But we will need something very important from you. Oh? Nathan will be called upon in our time of need. The responsibility of saving the world falls... ...on him. Hi. Sorry. Uh, I'm on Xanax. Xanax is good. I also had some red wine. Then I started getting sleepy, so I'm having some coffee. I think I broke something expensive. Did I, uh, miss the, uh... Is it possible to dim that light a little, please? Is Abigail here? I'm on Xanax. Whoa. Whoa. Uh, now it's too dim. Burdened with so much already. Though his trials have yet to begin. Oh, Nathan. Nathan. Ah, Nathan, a quick word, if you please. I have something quite wonderful to show you. As you know, I've been allotted vast resources and wanted to display my most recent endeavor. I call it the universal-- Fuck off. Oh. Yes. Perhaps we'll reconvene at a later date. Nathan is the key to the final stage of the Metalocalypse. But so are you. Be his friend. Even if it gets ugly, be a true friend. That's all? Yes. Goodbye, Pickles. Oh, oh. Okay. Hey, buddy. There you are. Fear, Nathan, it engulfs you. Plagued by your nightmarish memories. Unless you are vigilant, you will drown in fear. Um, hi. -What? -The rock, Nathan. I need to speak to you. The end of days are nigh. The Metalocalypse is upon us. The Great Reuniting. All halves will be complete. Salacia. Only he knows what vile evils are in store. Nathan, you will face him eventually. Uh, is there a place to sit? I've been on my feet-- "The Song of Salvation," how is that coming? Uh, I'm working on it. The Doomstar... creeps closer to our atmosphere every day, threatening cataclysmic destruction. Our time is running out, Nathan. There is, however, good news. There is protection. The prophecy speaks of the Army of the Doomstar. They will aid us in our time of need. Nathan, you must journey out to find "The Song of Salvation." I'm entrusting one of our newest and best clergy members to guide you. He will be your shaman, your musical and mystical guide through the tumult of meaningful creativity. You will go to an unknown location and be instructed in the spiritual ways-- Look, I can't be at the center of this. I've been thinking lately that life might actually be precious, that this business asks too much of me. So I want to start a new life. A family with someone that I like. Nathan, nobody can write the message of the song but you. I'm sorry. There's something I've got to do. Abigail! Nathan. Hi. It's just so good to see you. I... I haven't seen you since I pretty much saved your life, and you know, you kissed me. What's new? Well, um, I've been seeing a therapist to help me, though I... I don't remember much of anything. Have you thought about talking to a professional? Actually, uh, I've been speaking to a professional too. A professional diamond salesman. I've been thinking a lot. And the only thing that makes sense in this whole fucking putrid piece of shit world is you. What is he doing? Please stand up. Because when two people, you know, each other-- Please stand up. Please. -I guess what I'm saying, Abigail... -Please stand up. -...with all that is black and brutal... -Nathan, please stand up. ...will you marry me? No, Nathan. No. I'm not going to marry you. What? What? At least take a lap around the block. Think about it. I mean, I'm being submissive here. Look, I'm down. I could go lower. I could be on the ground. It's got to count for something. Nathan, we aren't even dating. But you kissed me. You saved my life and I gave you a kiss. Look, I think you're a great guy. -Oh, don't. Please. -Now you figure out who you are... -...and what you want. -Please don't do that. I'm sure you'll meet the right girl. Nathan, the whole reason I came here was to stop all of this. To end whatever you thought we were. Well, I guess this just isn't my day. Is it? Nathan, I came here to say goodbye. Goodbye. Abigail, come back! Hey, it's Nathan Explosion, right fucking there! Fuck me. Where's our fucking record? What happened to the fucking tour? Go away! Where is our shit, man? What do you want from me, anyway? We're here for you, man. We're here because we love you, bro. No, you don't. You're just a bunch of idiot fans. We love you! You're a god! What? No! The reason I'm all screwed up is because of you. No matter what I give, you want more. And I'm done. I'm done giving. You mean nothing to me. Hey, man, that's not nice. In fact, I want you out of my life. So why don't you fuck off? Fuck off on a fucking shit barge to outer space. 'Cause... 'Cause I'm breaking up with you! Go away, God damn it! Go away! There's no way this day could get any worse. Please welcome Dr. Rockzo, the rock and roll clown. Oh, fuck. Amazing grace How sweet the sound Is this in G? I thought this was... This is in F. A wretch like me I can't hear the monitor, man. I used to hit that note. Come on. Give it to me now! I once was lost and now I'm found I was blind, but now I see Give me a little more bass in the monitor. Dr. Rockzo knows we all gotta die someday. Years from now, even Dr. Rockzo's gonna meet sweet hereafter. But Dr. Rockzo knows he's going to that backstage party in the sky. And he knows he's gonna see St. Peter, the bouncer at the pearly gates. And you know St. Peter's gonna have a little bit of cocaine, right? And you know we're gonna have a party with all the lovers that we had and all the sexy mamas. And the angels are gonna be serving martinis. And at some point, that door's gonna fly open. And who's gonna be standing there? God himself. And he's gonna party down with all of us. That's right. Because we're all only here a short time, baby! And we gotta make the most of it all. We gotta carry on, and we must... We must love each other. In the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit... cocaine. I gotta blow some of these balloons. Who wants a balloon? I said, who wants a crucifix balloon? What ams wes gonna does? Nathan won't come out of there. Come on, he's been dumped. He feels like trash. Hey, Nathan. You feel like chatting with us a little bit? Let me at him. I know how to talk to Nate. Nathan, Murderface here. Hey, bud. Women are heartless monsters. And fuck those pieces of shit fans. And fuck those fucking dildo-licking douchebags into a pool of fucking fire! Shut up, Murderface. Look, Nate, just come out. Maybe we'll have some cocktails and French fries. Hmm. Sounds great? I've been thinking. I don't get to have what regular people have. All I have are you fuckbags. And it fucking sucks, but it'll have to do. Well, that's a clever way of saying it. What I'm saying is, all I have is jack shit here. And I'm settling for what I got. You idiots. Okay, we get it. So let's get the fuck out of here go write this song of sal-fucking-vation. Your shorts have been pressed and packed, sire. May I prepare your toiletries? Ah! No, thank you. Why don't you just throw yourself down the stairs. Bye. Sire. Hello? Who's there? Whoa! What is this? Apparently, we're supposed to work with some kind of a song guru here. Welcome to Dais Keep. Well, hi. Fucking Knubbler. Are you kidding? He's our spiritual musical guide? Well, uh, yeah, babe. This guy's an idiotic drug-mongering piece of shit, like us. How's that going to work? Don't overthink it. You know, it's fine. It'll be fine. Hey, where are you taking our stuff? Well, away, you know. Gone, you know. There are some rules here. No computers, no screen time, no contact with the outside world, okay? I mean, this is going to be unorthodox for you. This is a holy place, a place hidden away for centuries. A place of purity, a wonderful place of-- Hey, this is your water supply for your time here, all right, baby? Uh, wasn't aware. Now you know. What is music? Hmm? Think about it. What is that stuff? Music is a telegraph, baby. It's an invisible cluster of fucking frequencies and vibrations that when done right, infects the listener's soul with fucking cool ass emotion. It's the power to change a person's feelings, my beautiful little babies. Their attitude, perhaps even their whole life. And this is why you are here. To write "The Song of Salvation." Oh-oh, there's a fire right here. Get an extinguisher! Uh, this may be a dumb question at this point, but what is "The Song of Salvation?" -Nobody knows. -Huh. Well, do we at least know the running time, roughly-- Nobody knows. Does we at least know what keys it ends in? Nobody knows. What happens if we do it wrong? That we do know. The world will be bathed in blood and foul repugnance, and molten metal will rain from the skies, babe. The Earth will be a hellscape. Fuckers will be dying and shit. All that is good will be dead. The Metalocalypse! Fellas, the good news is that the song already lives inside of you. The reason you cannot see it is because it is being blocked by your egos. Uh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Your ego and fear is what keeps-- How does a song save the world? Can you at least tell us that? I cannot because I don't know. Not helpful. Uh, well, after you've written the song, you will rehearse and play from our studios broadcasting around the planet to millions of adoring fans. The fans. Nathan, as band lyricist, a lot of the weight will fall on you. The weight of the world. Well, that's a lot of weight. But you will never crumble as long as you believe in yourself. So, do you, babe? Here is your only writing challenge. Choose a person in your life with whom you'd like to have a conversation. That's all. If you can do that, then the rest will come like a powerful waterfall. Figure out who that person is, okay, babe? Let's talk band roles. A band is a family. There's a father, a mother, brothers, a sister. So let's talk about what each of you are really bringing to the table. Pickles, what's your role? Uh, to play the drums. Good. Murderface, quick. Come on. -Come on, come on, come on. -Okay. -I'm a fucking bass player, so... -Come on, come on, come on. I don't have a fucking role, so fuck off, right? Nah. Wrong. We'll come back. Nathan? -Uh, easy on the sad guy. -What? I'm... I'm joking. I'm... I'm the lyricist/front man, of course. You know, the fucking king, basically, baby. -What? -I'm kidding. I'll write this song. Don't you worry. I got it. -Good. Yeah! -I'm the band's guitar god. I am the sunshine rainbow marshmallow man. Yes, you are. Great. Well, everybody seems to know their place. Except you, Murderface. You still don't really know what you bring to the table, do you? Well, what do you think, gang? Can we help him figure out his role, since he doesn't really know? Uh, I don't know. He's always talking shit. Oh, yeah. He's always telling us whatever we're doing fucking sucks. -Okay. -He's generally in a shitty mood. -He brings that to the table. -What else? When we feel good about the parts, he complains that it sucks. He likes to explain why little tiny things we do in a song suck. His attitude sucks. -His job is to suck. He sucks. -Sucks! Murderface, this helping out, babe? Look. Look into my eyes. You belong to me now. You will be cunning. You will find the location of the Army of the Doomstar. And Nathan Explosion... you must crush his confidence. Sleep. Fuck this! There's got to be a better way. Look, I know you got a laptop in there. I need to make a call. Oh, boy. You're kind of putting me in a rough spot here, buddy. You know we're not supposed to have any electronics while we're here. There. Come on. Don't be a dildo. Aren't you worried about Knubbler catching you? It's cheating. Just promise me you won't go online and read the horrible shit the press is saying about you, okay? They're saying you don't have the goods anymore that you're just some fat celebrity. That you're weak. That you should just hang it up. Abigail. Oh, and that Abigail was only with you because she was scared of getting fired. You know, that kind of shit. Either way, it's all just noise. Pay it no mind, okay? Good pep talk. How's it goin', Nate? Oh, Nathan, we missed you! Are you okay? You look upset. Is your screen frozen? Hey, guys, what's up? What, are you napping or something? Anyways. Hey, you know why we're not supposed to have any screen time, right? And the boiler exploded and the people behind on the roller coaster got splashed. Can you do anything with that? Oh, fuck. Gross. Mom, that's not the help I'm looking for. Either way, I'm sure you'll figure it out. You always do. I don't think I can this time. And If I don't, the world will end. Oh, come on. You're always so tough on yourself. The world won't end. Yes, it will. It will. Hey, just wanted to say how sad we are that Abigail didn't work out. Why can't everybody just fuck off! Nathan. Fuck! Fuck. Now you're pissed. I am disappointed. Stop ringing that bell for fuck's sake. What the fuck. It's early for breakfast, dude. Shit. Look at all this exquisite food. Maybe I'll make a little plate for myself. I'll have a little of this. Uh-oh. Dropped it on the floor. Whoopsie-daisy. Maybe I'll just drop it all on the fucking floor. Gives me a fucking idea. What the fuck is he doing? -Oh, no. -My God, man! What are you doing? You're wrecking all the food, man! We are running out of time. Rules are being broken. So, we must speed up training. You need to be hungry. Work hard. The fun is over. You must be able to play anything. A band must function with military precision, eye contact. You must be able to read each other's minds. There lies the tree of knowledge. And here is the challenge. Water the tree. If you can do that, then you can reclaim your strength. Whoopsie-daisy! We must strengthen your musical resolve. Toki, tune that guitar, babe. Look, this is a clip-on guitar tuner. If you play a note, it will tell you what note it is and if it is in tune. See? Start practicing again. That's when you was good. Awaken. Find them. We are the gears in the wheel of the clock. We fear not our mortality. We will serve to the best of our ability. We are the gears. Praise blackness. Murderface? What are you doing down here? The Army of the Doomstar is here. You must swear a sacred oath to keep this a secret. Too many lives are at stake. Now go back to bed. You found the Army of the Doomstar, didn't you? The location, give it to me. -Give it to me. Give it to me. -Murderface! Fuck off! What? Hi. You were screaming in your sleep. Was that you I've seen roaming the halls at night? Fuck you! No! What are you doing, watching me? Get up. They want us outside. Come on, Nathan. You can do it. I believe in you, buddy. Go, Nathan. Come on. You're almost there. Come on. Ow! Oh, my God. He couldn't do it. But it's not about getting to the top. It's about what we do when we fail. Fuck! Don't despair, babes. At the end, you will find all the answers. Nathan, have you found someone you would wish to communicate with? No. I don't know what salvation is. Hope isn't a metal concept. People don't come to me for salvation. They come to me if they want a song about how your guts will be liquefied by a weed whacker. I sing about death, not about how you'll live. And all I can think to do is write what I know. The most furious and fucked up, the most brutal song ever written. I guess. And you think this will be "The Song of Salvation?" Well, it's all I fucking got. I don't know. I think this plan sucks. I've done my best to guide through the labyrinth of creative discovery. Together, we work to give fertility to the soil of your soul. What? And now we're down to the last and most important lesson. -Drugs. -What? Oh, yeah. This is mare viridates. Weed from the sea. It helps us to see and feel that which we cannot in our conscious state. The truth. But can you ask the right questions and get to the core of yourself? If you are ready to seek help, then confess. I doubt myself. But you must doubt yourself. I can't do what I'm asked to do. And why do you think that is? Die. But you are the beast daughters of the apocalypse. You must bring about the end to live. Nothing makes sense. You sink in the darkness. But now is the time for you to choose. Will you be the fist or the hand? One strikes at all before them. The other reaches out for other life. What will happen must happen. As long as there is life, there is hope. What is that? The deadline is here. This is it. We go live now. This is our only shot. Believe in yourselves and we are gold. Hello, everybody. It's me, Facebones. Welcome to the Dethklok live stream event. Please enjoy. It will be on in ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five... What is it that you desire to be? -The fist or the hand? -...four, three... -My God. Is this the wrong song? -...two... One. We're all going to die We're all going to die We're all going to die eventually Toxic waste, acidic paste, degradation Crushed by a plane, driven insane Mutilation Cranial glitch, dumped in a ditch Gangrenous stitch Fever has entered your soul How could you be So fucking naive? Fled for refuge You fell to your knees You spoke the words And brandished your heart You left yourself open To be torn apart Torn apart Aortic desecration How could I be so wrong? Disemboweled publicly This is the dying song Bleed Bleed Bleed Bleed Aortic desecration My God, how did they find us? Run! Skwisgaar, no! You did this. Please get out of my head! Pickles, pull it together, buddy. He wants his guitar. It comforts him. It happened like the prophecy said, the Metalocalypse. Anyone seen Murderface? I saw him run away somewhere... Out there. You were infiltrated. You. I come in peace. I can help you. You've got nobody else, anyway. The Army of the Doomstar is gone. All of them. They're all dead. If you want me to take a look at him, I can help. He's in shock from the explosion, but he'll be back to normal soon. Here, Skwisgaar, you want to make sure you are in tune. What are you playing there? Start talking. Why are you here? Years ago, I was seduced by the power of what I thought was a man. Salacia. Yes. But when I started to do some digging, he didn't like that. He took control over me. He possessed me. He used me. He used the power of the military. He wanted to kill the people protecting you, the Army of the Doomstar. And he gloated about possessing another in order to get close. Skwisgaar, what are you playing? But what Salacia couldn't control was that while he possessed the other, I was free. So I jumped, thinking it would all be over. But something in the water terrified Salacia and it drove him out. So who was it that betrayed us? Uh... Guys. Oh, my God. He knew. Murderface. He was weak and vulnerable to Salacia's spell as I was, and forced to do the unspeakable. Your friend is innocent, but Salacia, he's still inside of him. If you can find your friend, you can save him. You'll have to perform an exorcism. You've got to submerge him until the beast exits his body. Be careful, you could kill him. One, two, three! Come and find me, Nathan Explosion. You all will die. Get away from me! Don't you know what I've done? But it wasn't you. You said it. I have no role in this band. What? Of course you do. Your role is to suck. It's so important to us that you suck. You're the voice of dissent. Don't you get it? Without you, we're fooling ourselves. No. I'm no better than Magnus. Hey, no. Magnus never gave us a chance to forgive him. He was too busy being angry and selfish. But we forgive you, Murderface. You bring balance to this band by sucking. You suck so fucking much, we can't live without you. Come back to us. Suck the life out of every waking moment with us. Come back and suck. But you can't even hear the bass. But you can always feel it. What do we do now? I fucked up. I wrote the wrong song. So, everybody should blame me. I guess I'm no goddamn good after all. Ow! What the fuck. -What do you... -Ow! What's happening? You feeling sorry for your dumpy ass, you little dildo fuckhead? Ow! Fucking Knubbler gave you one job, but you fucked it up, didn't you, you little dick lick. Find one person to communicate with-- But everybody abandoned me. Nope. You shut down and pushed them out like a fucking little douchebag dildo, frankly. Quit hitting me. First thing is, I'm feeling much better. Thank you all. And number two, this is weird. Should we get going? The question is, what would you say if they were all in your life, stupid? What would you say? I'd say, I... I'd say, "Come back." Come back, and maybe together we can fight all of this. Now, that would be a pretty good "Song of Salvation," actually, you know. Holy shit! That is "The Song of Salvation." I mean, none of this is about me or us. It's about everybody else that's alive. I'm just a little part of it. I'm just a gear in the wheel of the clock. Holy shit. That's what that means. This is it. We have to find a way to play this song. Then we're going to find that fucker who fucked up Murderface, the fucker who's fucking up this whole planet. And we're gonna go fuck him up. See how he likes it. The Dethjet. If it wasn't destroyed, it can get us out of here. Try not to kill us, Pickles. Toki, be a good boy and bring Mommy a scotch, okay? I got this. Whoa! So, what's your plan? It's not mine. It's his. What the fuck is this piece of shit doing inside of my lab-- This piece of shit's with us now. -Hi. Sorry about everything. -Heh! Are you, then? This is the universal stereo. It's a PA system that can amplify a concert for the entire planet. If that's the case, then we'll need to hardwire in. Correct, Skwisgaar. Computer, deploy the universal stereo. There are five major points that must be plugged in. Each of you will have to fly and plug in to the audio-ins at the patch base located at one of the five points. Each of your flight pods is equipped with an autopilot. You'll just have to be guided through the plug-in process. Then meet at the stage center so that you can play the song. My God, this is amazing. No shit, Sherlock. Nathan's been hit. I'm okay. Just a cosmetic wound. I've been thinking about Salacia. You told us to find him. So, let's say we do find him, then what are we supposed to do? He's more powerful than anything this planet knows. Even worse, he's going to become stronger. He calls it The Great Reuniting. And he's bringing reinforcements. And what you're calling the Doomstar isn't just a star. It's also a portal to another place and time, and a weapon. He built the world's biggest superconductor, so then he could pull the star closer to the earth-- Note, it's also terrifying the planet. I don't understand what this has to do with us. A powerful force is needed to wedge open the Doomstar's portal gates so that the half man could be completed. The rest of the souls, that force is you. It gave me gifts as well. The Dethlights. My God. You should be in range now. Okay. Everybody else good? Nathan, what's going on? Bad news. Hit I took fused the compartment shut. Then you'll have to do it manually. Oh, boy. Nathan, look out! Oh, no! Nathan! It's okay. I'm alive. Now what do I do? You see a gigantic cable? -Yeah. -I'm sending you towards it. Oh, fuck! Oh, shit! Got it. Guide me in. I need to say something to my band. Pickles, Skwisgaar, Murderface, Toki, you stood by me after Abigail dumped me. You never gave up on me. And in case you're wondering, we never had sex. Really? Yeah. Shit. That's okay, 'cause it wouldn't have been right. And Abigail... Abigail, wherever you are in this world, I'm sorry that I tried to force something that wasn't there. I respect you and I want you to be happy. And I'll grow stronger because I'll always have my relationship with music. All right! Motherfucker, way to go! We're flying the stage craft towards Batsfjord, Norway, near the Arctic Circle. There's great deal of magnetic activity and striation. That's where Salacia is. You'll see I've upgraded your instruments. They're to your exact specifications and then some. Oh, cool! My teddy bear. Hey, you're one hell of a motherfucker. I am but a gear in the wheel of the clock. We got something we been working on, so you just got to bring the message. You're the absolute best mother... fucker. Motherfucker. I'll see you on stage. I'll see you on stage. This one's for Knubbler! People of Earth... this is Dethklok. You don't have to be afraid anymore. Last breath skyward Dark sign, closing line No time to mend this life Take this hand This last time We're the shadows of the infinite We stand alive We're nothing but the soil of time Beasts in the night Reach with my open hand Bound for all time In the shadows of the blazing star Fused with the light Now rise! Rise! Rise! Rise! Rise! Rise! Rise! Shoot them down, now! Move it out, move it out Brace for a crash landing. Here we go! You want to get killed or you want a chance to join something good? You know, if you think you're making us shit our pants over here... Close. Take them. Tonight, all things change. Sad, isn't it? But, pledge your allegiance to me, and I will kill your friends quickly. I'm offering a seat at the table. Well, I'm good on furniture right now. I don't need any chairs or... Hmm... I think I got... I got everything I need. Be quiet! You're just as mentally inept as they said you were. Just takes me a long time to learn stuff. When this ends, I will crucify you, but I won't kill you. I will keep you alive in wretched misery. You know, you don't really have to go to the trouble. How was the conversation? It was good. Well, hey, what's that? It's my last meal. I've got some bowls of kombuchas. I never tried it before. Like a vinegar soda. Oh, yeah, yours is over there. I, uh, ordered for you. Chocolate milk and Cool Ranch Doritos. Hmm. You know, I've always said it's the best thing-- The best thing a death metal vocalist can eat. Shit. You really know me. I don't know what else to say. I think we're going to die. Really? Really dead? Yeah. I think we're gonna die. -Toki, try to be strong. -Okay. Try to be strong. I never even finished Planet Piss. I'm gonna be one of those dildos that everybody knows can't complete a project. Everybody else will be dead too, so who cares, really? Death, it's a real get-out-of-jail-free card, isn't it? Well, I guess I'll see you in the afterlife, Skwisgaar. Hanging out every day for eternity. So you're saying we're going to hell? I've been thinking about the Dethlights. Can we ever summon that power again? Was that power even ours? Or was it the Doomstar doing it all? You know, to stop us from being killed. Yeah. To protect us so that we can be used for something even more horrible. This. I'm the gear in the wheel of the clock. I fear not my mortality. I will serve to the best of my... Behold! The Great Reuniting! No! The Doomstar portal is open! Summoning the four souls to cascade forth and fuse into the half man making him whole again. It's happening. Look. It's coming closer. It's happening. It's happening! It's happening! I'm the gear in the wheel of the clock. I fear not my mortality. I will serve to the best of my ability. He's alive. Growing in power. Good. Well, I think a tad bit faster. Now get me to that contraption before they fix it. Now mush. I'm working on it. It was nice working with you. -Yes. -Somebody's inside. My brother, at last I'll be with you. No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no! It's still alive. I can see its heart beating. Dethklok is of no use to us now. Kill them. It's too late. It's over. What's that sound? Dethklok! -Dethklok! -They came. Who came? The fans! They heard us. "The Song of Salvation" worked. The fans. I've always loved them! Team A, that thing is vulnerable. We need to squash it before it's too late. Team B, protect Dethklok. Let's end this. Stay away from them. Those are my spiritual saviors you're fucking with. No! Hey! Sorry. I thought you were somebody else. Please don't kill me. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. All members of the US military, stand down! Do not hurt the civilians. They're not the enemy. Protect them at all costs. Go into the waters. Don't you know only a god can kill a god? That was upsetting! Oh, it's my teddy bear. Oh, cool. Holy shit. Did we survive? Dethklok! Dethklok! Dethklok! I, uh, have something to say. Shut the fuck up for one second! I wanna say thank you. I mean, you're not just the fans, you're... My God, you are the Army of the Doomstar. Holy shit. I'm just putting that together. I mean, you were always the Army of the Doomstar, and you were always right in front of me. And I just didn't see it. I mean, sure, our relationship could get tricky, but you were always there for us. I mean, holy fucking shit! And I'm sorry I tried to break up with you. But you came when we needed you the most. And I just realized something else. Oh, boy. My family, my band, all of us. This! This is The Great Reuniting! Thank you! What a fucking day! Right?
