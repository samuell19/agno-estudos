Well clearly neither do I. Have you thought about an app? Yeah, I've been thinkin' about chicken wings. - No. - Like, no seriously. No, no, no. I've been thinkin' about 'em all morning.

I heard your name over there and I just felt like maybe this was meant to be. I'm in a bit of a pickle. Okay, my dad owns a chauffeur service and he's gonna lose his company 'cause Uber is crushing him. So I came up with a show idea where every week I would drive a celebrity in the car. Like Seinfeld? Yeah, sort of like Seinfeld but different. Now listen, I got lucky enough because this movie convention in town and I got the kid from "Rookie of the Year". Smalls? No, that's "The Sandlot". The other kid, he was in "American Pie". Ah, Stifler. No, they other guy. The one who always bring everyone together and you know always calls his brother for advice. Thomas Ian Nicholas. Who's the most famous person you ever met? I met Stallone once. I wanted to buy him a drink but he said, "No." He was like, "No, thank you, that's all right, don't worry about it." I was like, "I thought you love almost everybody, you know." And then he was like, "All right, stop doing that." So. He was my first interview, I didn't do too good with it. Are you filming this right now? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Is that a problem? I mean. I'm sorry. He got out on the highway. He's small, there's cars, there's trucks out there. That's neither here nor there. I'm here, he's there, you're here in front of me. Not sure if you're aware but there's a movie convention going on right about your head. - Yeah, I know. - Okay.

Okay, let me give you my card, if there's anybody you can think of call me. I would go up myself but my mind, I'm just on overload from everything that happened and I'm honestly concerned about little Tommy. Look, I got a better idea, there's a after party tonight at Barnaby's and all the celebs are gonna be there from the convention. - Okay. - All you gotta do is go there, you're bound to meet somebody. Is there like a list or anything. Nah, nah, just walk right on in. And look I mean I guess if you're not gonna go and I see somebody I give you a call or somethin'. I can't thank you enough. I really appreciate you, sir. I appreciate, thank you, Gervais. Thanks, it's Gervase though. Take care. What are you fuckin' stupid? That's the perfect opportunity. I'm not doing that bullshit.

And when you were in the incubator your mom slipped into a coma. She came to, obviously. Yeah. And she started praying nonstop, just begging God, nagging him frankly, she said, "That if she could please live until you were 21 then he could take her." She said that? Somethin' huh? Sweet isn't it? She died three months after my 21st birthday. I know that. Why ya telling me this now? Well, I just thought you should know that after all these years you killed your mother. Oh my God, Dad. By turning 21 you killed your mother. Are ya done? All right, all right, all right, no, no. You did however kill my wife. That- I'm done with ya. All right. I'm done with ya.

No, no, I'm not getting either, okay. And I have to warn you I'm a lifelong WWF fan, if you move any closer I will be forced to Hulk Hogan your ass. What the hell are you talkin' about, man? Hulk Hogan was a bitch. What? Wait a minute, are you talking about the Hulk Hogan from WCW with black, 'cause then I'd probably agree with you? 'Cause yellow and red was definitely not a bitch. No, the WCW Hogan was the dope one, that WWF with the yellow was all whack. What did you just say? You take that shit back! For what he was whack. Let's go, let's go. Won't take it back JYD, me and you, right now, come on. - What, ya want some? - Me and you. Let's go. Let's go. Oh, oh you know wrestling then.

Sorry to bother you, sir, we got a few questions. Would you mind coming down to the station for a little bit? Sure, what's this in regards to? Like you don't' know. One of your vehicles was used in a possible crime last night. Oh boy. Sure, yeah, let's go. Look what just came in to the tip line. You gotta be kidding me? No, jackass here used his own personal cell phone. What the hell is the fat man wearing? I believe that's a romper. Oh God, that it is, that is a romper. I'm no fashionista but he's kinda wearin' it. I tried to get in a romper once but they had to cut me out of it. Do you remember when Sean Connery wore the romper in "Goldfinger". Oh, you're taking me back. - Looked sexy baby. - Disturbing. Guys. James Bond in a onesie. I have all the 007's on DVD. - Get out of here. - Gentlemen. - You do? - Yeah. - How'd you get that? - My nephew, he, every year he buys me one for godfather's day yeah. Look gentlemen. Yeah, look guys, guys, guys, guys, this guy here he's my son's brother-in-law and this guy is the guy we drove home the other night. So you admit you kidnapped him? What did you do to Gervase? We didn't kidnap him. We, he was drunk frankly, we gave him a ride home. We thought we were being nice. Mr. Martin, are you telling me you didn't see the news today that Gervase was kidnapped? No, I don't watch the news. My TV broke and my kid bought me a Smart TV and I'm frankly too dumb to use it so no. Would you be willing to give us your son's address? Is he gonna get in trouble? I'm not sure, sir, but we gotta figure this out. Yeah, Mr. Martin, you, you stay here. Okay, all right. Gervase better be okay. Finally. - All right. - Got they asses now. Here we go. Tell me you're out of gas again. I bet if Gervais was there pumping gas over in Jersey you woulda stopped and got it. It's Gervase. Gervase, Gervais, oh my God. Oh my God. All right, call for backup. What a day, dude, what a day. I know. Hey, is everything cool with Andrea? Yeah, now she's all right, man. I calmed her down. How about you? I hope everything's all right with you. I mean we'll see. I hope this all works out, brother. Hope it works out for you too, man, you and your dad and the business. You know I remember when I was acting and you were big on "Survivor" that year and I saw on the TV that you were on "Nash Bridges" and you got shot in the ass and I was pissed because I was working my ass off tryin' to be an actor. And they were just throwing a bones like left and right all the time. And I put everything on hold when my mom died, everything for my dad. I just never had the opportunity to live my dream. I miss my mom so much, man. Her name was Peachie, her real name was Carol but everybody called her Peachie. Even when she was sick, a month before she died went to the movies to see "Down to Earth", I had a small part where I ate a hotdog. She was so sick by the time she got up to say, that's my son, Chris Rock was back on the screen. People were like, what's wrong with that lady? I just miss it. But I wanna do my own thing, I wanna live my dream, and I wanna ask questions. I wanna bring stuff out of people. Like for you here's a question I would ask ya, when you were at your height did you ever still walk into a room and feel like nobody knew who you were? Of course, man, think that happens to everybody. I mean I remember this one time I was in L.A., I went to this huge house party and I get in there and in that corner is Hugh Hefner and the seven girlfriends, this corner over here is P Diddy, the Lakers are over there, Tommy Lee and Pam Anderson in the other corner. And I see Sam Jackson and Chris Tucker and I'm a huge Sam Jackson fan. So I go over to him and I'm like, "Hey Mr. Jackson, I'm." And he's like, "I know who you are motherfucker!" Like Sam Jackson knew who I was. - That's awesome, man. - Yeah man, it's pretty crazy. Being that you did all that stuff and you were famous do you ever think about that when you're laying in bed at night like how was there and now I'm here? Like where'd it all go? I mean, look man everybody's got a story to tell. You know like my mom had Alzheimer's, you know. - She did. - Yeah. You know same thing I had to move back home and take care of her. But you know I was fortunate enough to keep things going. You know a lot of people think that I was just given things, I caught a break 'cause I did "Survivor" but I earned everything that I've got and everything I've been through I worked hard for. And it's like anybody else man, you know once you hit the top the only place to go is down from there. I just hope it all works out, man. I do too, man. I appreciate you and I'm glad I met you. I guess everything happens for a reason, right. That's what they say. I'm gonna close my eyes now for a little bit, man. That's not a bad idea. Gerv, we fell asleep, buddy. You got a red dot on your head. You got a red dot head on your forehead too. - What? - Hands up dickheads! Above your asshole! - Oh my god! - Yo, yo! Does that have anything to do with the kid from "American Pie"? Shut your mouth! Is he still alive? I didn't do anything. Yo what's going on? He jumped out of the car all on his own. We got you. Get you away from this Buffalo Bill motherfucker. What's going on? What's happening? We come to arrest him, get ya out of here. Don't worry, I got my special blanket, it only has one crusty corner. I got more in the car. What you talkin' about? Gervase! What the fuck is going on here? Gervase, there's policeman and press outside and Summer's been on her phone all day, and you are trending on every social media that there is. You're back on top, buddy! Back on top! You just saved your own career. We are gonna do big things together, big things! That was not sexual. Hey, Summer. Whew, what a dump. I don't remembering eating that. Can smell thing, hey where are you guys going? What- Oh, no, there's one more, there's one more! Hello, how are you? Good, how are you? What's your name? Summer. Summer, I'm Tanner. Hi, Tanner. You like wrestling? Oh, absolutely. Come over my parents house every Monday night, pizza night. Okay. Monday night. Thank you so much. Rochester Big and Tall romper sale, romper madness. Hey, email me, okay. Okay. Wrestlingfan316machoman@hotmail. org. I think I love you. State your name. Ray Martin. State your name. Summer Andrews. State your name. Tanner, Tanner Murphy, two N's, one T. Have you ever been arrested? No, I never been arrested. This is great, I never been in one of these. Have you ever been arrested? Yeah, I've been a bad girl. Have you ever been arrested? Arrested, no, no, no, I don't get arrested. I've never, I'm a big fan of "Cops", love the show. Describe your relationship with Gervase. Professional, he's great. You ever see the episode where the guy stole the cop car? He's wife chased him down, you guys couldn't get 'em. And remember he ran, he got away but that doesn't matter. Gervase, did I see him on the news? Are you kiddin' me? This guys all over the place. I shoulda let him keep the damn hat. It wouldn't been incredible for my business. Speaking of business, do you like meatballs? Goddamn, got old. He looks like shit. I got a meatball sandwich. It'll knock your socks off. Did you kidnap Gervase? No, but I'd love to kidnap you. Did you kidnap Gervase? No. I turned my back for one second he takes the tincture. The tincture is meant for sipping. It will relax his muscles and help him quite a bit. He took the whole thing, he's probably dead. Start from the beginning, Gervase. Tell me about the last 24 hours. Yesterday was my first interview for a movie I'm not even proud of. Did you ever get enjoyment from tying people up? Handcuffs are more my thing. I was Tanner's phone call, he called me, said, "He was in jail." I ran right down. So I'd like to be put in a cell with him. I think I killed Gervase. Did I kill Gervase? Have I, is he dead, is he dead? Oh fuck! Enough! Well, I just knew there was something wrong when he didn't show up last night. Ma'am, what's your relationship with Gervase? Oh, we're lovers of course. Of course. Now if you wanna get out of here you need to tell us everything. Everything? It all started when I was in the eighth grade I failed my math maintenance test, I took it home, didn't show my mom, threw it down the sewer, then the bad habits just started. Wait that was Gervase? In my bar. Man, I didn't even recognize that dude. I started smoking cigarettes, masturbating, watching porn, smoking cigarettes while masturbating while watching porn, it was horrible. And that's when Tanner knocked Gervase on his ass. Tanner did not knock me out, I fell. Then I got expelled from high school, I didn't know she was a nun, she was in plain clothes. Enough! Everything about Gervase. Oh, Gervase, oh, well, I just got done pumpin' some iron. I can't be handing out tinctures, I'm not a doctor. This is not a doctor's coat, this is lounge wear. After I knocked him out we took 'em to my buddy the Doctor, we didn't know where else to go. This guys a really good friend of mine, we took him in there, I thought he'd help him out, I went along with whatever he said. He just wouldn't stop talking, he memorizes me when he talks. He's a really interesting fella. You gonna keep somebody warm at night. I'm not a kidnapper. I never kidnapped anything in my entire life. Kidnapping is a serious situation, all right. This is something you really can't mess around with. It's not uncommon for people in your position to wanna defend their abductors, it's called Stockholm syndrome. What? Finish this off. I gotta take a piss. Oh my God, I can't believe I'm a felon, I'm a felon. How can I be a felon I was a Boy Scout once? Oh my God, please get me out of here. Please, I'll do anything God. I'll get rid of my porn except for the one "Hustler" 'cause I really like that one. Oh, please, please get us out of this. Please, please. - Tanner. - Ray. God doesn't hear ya hear. Sorry. Why are we here? You fucked up flounder. I just wanted to help you, pop. No, you help me, you help me more than you know. You gave me grandkids. So much fucking fun. When I think of the fun your mother would have with them ah, my heart melts. Look don't worry about losing the business. Yeah. Life's about more than that, okay. It's about what ya leave behind, your legacy. I've always thought that when ya die ya die twice, first time when ya, you know actually die and the second time when the last person mentions your name. Now with those kids they're never gonna forget your mother's name. Yeah. And because of you nobody's gonna forget that Gervase's name. What an asshole. Oh, come on, he's fine. You done good kiddo. Thanks, Dad. I'm proud of ya. I love ya. Oh no, no, no just blow me with the slow clap. No. It would be my honor, sir. I guess that's the wrong thing to say in jail. Right time wrong place. No, please stop. Got it, rain check. Well, we gotta let these assholes go. You know this story is so unbelievable that it's almost believable. Yeah, millennials, what ya gonna do? Everybody's got a cellphone and a camera on it. You know you can't even get in a fight with somebody and throw them in your car. Now when I was a kid, when I was a kid ya got in a fight that was it. You throw somebody in the back of your trunk they disappear. They still haven't found my Uncle Louie, God rest his soul, maybe, we don't know. What ya gonna do? Oh, by the way Gervais's agent's here, paid the bail. Don't take it so hard kid, all right. Ya did good. It's Gervase. Whatever. Let's go get these assholes out of here. Martins, romper boy! Love ya guys. Good luck. You must be Ray. Yeah. I just wanted to thank you. For what? New revenue streams. Is this your lover? It's my father. Ooh, Mr. Ray, well hello. So I thought I should tell you that Gervase told the police, "That it was all just a big misunderstanding." So why don't you buy me a drink. Okay. Follow me. Oh my God, I'm free, I'm- - Hey, you were in here for 58 minutes. - That's a long time. - Get your ass out. Comin'. Nah, nah, I'm good. You guys are taking this no snitches way too far. We're a team now. I gotta represent in here. We're a team. Tanner, get emails! This is Cisco in the City and I'm sitting here with my main man Gervase Peterson. Gervase, I mean this is fantastic, man. I mean literally a year ago I mistakenly reported that you were missing and the whole world thought that you were missing. They thought you were kidnapped but now look at you. I mean shit is, ooh, can I curse? One, ya get one. Shit is crazy. You get two. After the incident you know everything just fell into place for me and God works in mysterious ways. So you just finished a M. Night film and he bought the rights to your life story too. Yeah, that was crazy. You know we start filming early next year. We're already in pre-production. Son of a bitch. - What? - Think about it man. - Gervase. - Ya fell of the face of the earth, ya get kidnapped, your story goes viral and now your back on top of the world. Can you believe that? No, at least somebody made out on this deal. I would say so. And I have an awesome agent and I just hired a great manager. Cecily, how are ya? - That's- - My pleasure. That's Cisco. Right. Yeah, we got some great things in the works for old Gervase here, a little "Dancing with the Stars", a little "Survivor" reunion. - Nice. - Right. And wanna tell the good news? Sure, we're engaged. Beautiful. Man, look at this lovely couple here. You guys are sharp as a tack. You must be going somewhere tonight. - No. - No. No, just Tuesday. Son of a bitch. What's up, bud? Hey man, package for Ray Martin Jr. - That's me. - That's you. - Yep. - Hey man, thanks. Son of a bitch. Dear Ray, thank you for everything you did for me. I can't believe how much someone's life can change within 24 hours and even more in a year. You came into my life at a time when I needed something to pick me up. It turns out that something was you. You didn't have to do everything ya did for me but out the kindness of your heart ya did. What the hell? I can't read it, what? What? I heard Hybrid Planet was closing down so I wanna return the favor here's a check for $500,000. That should be enough to get the company- - No. - To where it needs to be. Consider it an advance. Peachie, ya did it again, girl. Ah, hey, what's up, man? You're Kabir. Do I look like a Kabir, man? I don't know, am I saying that wrong or? You're saying, I don't even know who you're looking for. We're not, I'm not a Uber, buddy. No, it said, oh you're not my Uber? Not an Uber. I mean it says it was the right car. What's your license plate? - Oh fuck. - Fuck this.
