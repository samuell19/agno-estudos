- Is this what life is about? - Yes. Thirteen drivers were caught with no papers. More than 5,000 drivers were monitored in this operation... Lord, dinner! I'm coming. - I'm going out. - Say hello to Sara. HOURS EARLIER I don't want to anymore. Ok, I apologize. Again? Don't apologize. I just don't want to anymore. I don't know. I don't get it... Are you ok? I am. I'm the one who should apologize. Well, see you tomorrow then. Bitch... - What's up, Paulo Rodrigo? - What's up, Paulo Rodrigo? We could have gone to the beach... - If you woke up in the morning. - We could have gone in the afternoon. You wouldn't have wanted to go with me and Bruno. Yeah... right. So? So... nothing. Are you sad? I don't know. I guess not. He's cool. Yeah, he is. Next week, my cousin's getting married. - Fuck... - You bet. My family is coming from Austria. I'll have to sleep with my brother. And the only fancy dress I have... Do you remember the one? It doesn't fit me anymore. - Do you want to borrow one of mine? - No, mom wants to buy me a new one. - Ah! My uncle wants us all to sing. - That should be good! Only for you. You don't have to sing. I'd love to hear you: Words are dancing Words are dancing In this occasion In this occasion Rui and Filipa are getting married It's quite a sensation! - Her name's Filipa, right? - It is. Will you be wearing heels? I will. Good morning, you ugly little dog. FOREIGN POPULATION GROWTH IN PORTUGAL - 1960-2011 - I didn't see you come in, - That's ok, Mr. Pimentel. I let myself in. - I didn't want to bother you. - You know you never bother me. - Can you leave it on my desk? - I sure will. Good morning, Paulo Rodrigo! It's already paid for. There, it's coming. - Is it ours? - Yes, it's coming. I'll press the button! - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. Look, Beatriz, I got your nose! Liar! It's here. - Go in... - Thank you. I'll press it. Do you want me to put you down? - This one is new. - Brand new. He moved in a month ago. - He lives downstairs close to you, in 3E. - That's where Pedro used to live. Now, he was cute... What's the matter, Misha? Did you hurt yourself? No. It's so I don't get appendicitis. Bruno sent me a message last night. But I didn't answer him back. You'll answer later. I don't want him to come. But he will. Bruno sent me a message last night. But I didn't answer him back. You'll answer later. I don't want him to come. But he will. - Not that. That's too aggressive. - You baby! - Fine, but let's also put some Lily Allen then. - Yeah, that's cool. Play this one! - Jiggy Fernandez? - Yeah. Sara, I'm going outside. I think I'm clear from appendicitis for today. See you later, Misha. Yesterday, I watched some videos of a sloth online. - The animal? - Yeah. They freak me out. They're so slow. Yeah. Hey! That's so lame! Crying he will be, when he's dreaming of me... - Come on! - Leave me alone! Leave it! - What?! - What?! Hey! What was this?! - She's not the one for you. - But I really like her! Yeah, but she's not for you. - It's got to be something. - It's nothing. - Is it your parents? - No. - Is it João? - No. - Drink. - I don't want to. Ok, I'll drink it then. - Man, he shouldn't have done that! - The fighting was totally unnecessary! I wasn't expecting it at all! - She's totally drunk! - Not yet, little baby. Not yet. Lights out! Come on, kid! At least, eat something. You drank too much Coca-Cola last night. Hey! Look! Like this! No! It's too much! I don't want it! - Take a smaller bite. - No! Beatriz! Come on. Just one. Just a spoonful. I'll stir it up. See? - No! - No lumps. I'll eat it myself. Eat your peach then. Do you want your spoon? I'll clean it. I look like a lamp! Of course you don't! Put your shoes on. You have to stretch your legs. - Like this? - No, dummy. You can bend your legs. But don't put the foot of the bended leg down. And you don't need to look like a giraffe. Your neck is all stretched out. - It is? - Yes. Damn it, this is hard! It's like acrobatic gymnastics. Now you look like a cockatoo. - Thanks a lot. - The other one suits you better. But with this one, I could wear these. This is kind of secretary-like, don't you think? Not really... What's up with you today?! Nothing. I got a hangover. I'm gone! MELANESIA - PARADISE ISLANDS Pretty, isn't it? Said the devil when he saw his mother's ass. What? - Nothing. Never mind. - That's OK, I was distracted. No wonder, just to see the scale of it all... - And the tons of work, sleepless nights... - Yeah, congratulations. Good morning, Paulo Rodrigo! You have to come and see something. Here at the centre. Come on, wake up! Sara, come on. Please...! See you later! Beautiful, isn't it? It's kind of spooky... Then come check this out. Look! Filipe Mesquita! Very nice. Can I? Oh my god! If you want to fool around with Colonel Tapioca... You can. - Are you sure? - Yes. He doesn't have a wife. At least, I never saw one. - It's not that. - What then? You saw him first. You asshole! Can he be just "Colonel"? Come on! - Good morning, you ugly little dog! - Hi. Hi, Rita! - Hi, Nuno. - Are you coming to Paredes de Coura? - I don't know. Who's playing? - Lots of bands. I'm going to see Cansei de Ser Sexy. (Tired of Being Sexy) Are you? - Yes. - Too bad. Then I guess I won't go. - Please come... - I'm going to check out Boom with Chico. You baby boy! Bye, take care. Kikori... Honiara... Noumea... Yes? I'm going to Alaska. Don't forget to take your bonnet. It doesn't fit me anymore. New Caledonia belongs to France? If it says so in there, I bet it's not. Come on... I don't know, honey. I guess it is. Don't stay up too late. Hi, how are you? Yeah, I'm fine. What's the name of that software to download music? Wait... Great, thanks. Yeah... I know, Bruno. I'm sorry. Yeah, I guess not. Take care, bye. I forgot something. I'll be back in no time. Hi, neighbour! - Hi... - Is that for Beatriz? Yes it is. - Bye. - Bye. Shit! Where have you been? Didn't I tell you to get some prunes? - Were they out? - Mom... Don't "mom" me. Come on, I'm seeing a patient at one o'clock. He was so embarrassed, the poor man... What did you expect? He doesn't even know you yet. Yeah... Maybe you shouldn't have called his daughter by the name... Why? I don't know, he might think you're crazy paranoid. Huh? Not everyone remembers a neighbour's daughter's name. - I always remember people's names. - Of course you do. But that's not it. - What then? - Forget it. Do I look OK? You look nice, don't worry. If the Colonel took a good look at you, I'm sure he enjoyed the view. Maybe he doesn't like yellow... You sound like a little virgin. I'm glad we're going to the Festival tomorrow. This place is boring me to death. - I don't feel like going. - Don't you start! Do you prefer to stay here staring at the balcony and play that cranky organ? YOU BETTER BELIEVE YOU'RE COMING WITH ME TOMORROW Sorry. Kikori... Honiara... Noumea... - My beloved baby! - Neat, huh? It's awesome, Rita. What is this? It's gouache over a white base. And some of your eye liner... No. Where does this come from? Ah! It's a mix. These are ritualistic paintings from the Huli in Papua New Guinea and drawings from a cult in the island of Tanna. It's Melanesian paintings, mom! What about the small airplanes? In Vanuatu, a very original cult was established when the American troops settled there during the Second World War. When the natives saw the American planes dropping crates of food from the sky, they believed a new Messiah would descend from the heavens... That's nice. ...and they named him John From, probably because some airman introduced himself as John From America. Paulo Rodrigo, my ass! He was there and you didn't tell me?! Who?! My uncle, who else? He's not Colonel anymore. Now he's John From. John From! From nowhere, I'll explain later. Rita! Those spirits are messing with your head! Yes, Sara. I'm tired of being sexy. I saw it in the paper. Are you coming back tomorrow? I'll talk to you then, I'm running out of money. Are you drunk? - Good morning. - Good morning... She has the Melanesia sickness. Come on! I can't do it this way. You look like a dork! Come on, concentrate! Why are you looking like a robot? What if he shows up like this? Will you start laughing? No. I'll hold on to him and kiss him. You're crazy... First, it's the window opening up by itself... - It's true! - OK, sorry. Let's try again. Good afternoon, John From... Good afternoon, Filipe. Good afternoon. This is the time to attack. Otherwise, he won't even stop. Do you think so? A peach was lying in bed, perfectly still, watching time go by. An old lady came along and said: "Look, it's a peach!" And... wham! She ate it. That's what happens to peaches that lie in bed, perfectly still, watching time go by. I wanted to congratulate you. I loved the exhibition. Nice one! Then you keep talking about Tufalu, Kikori or whatever. Again! - Good afternoon, Filipe. - Good afternoon. I wanted to congratulate you. I loved the exhibition. Thank you. The picture you took in Kikori is particularly interesting. The flooding of Papua New Guinea's lowlands has always fascinated me. Do you know it? - A little bit... - Nice! It must have been an amazing experience! Yes. It was really worth it. Well, see you tomorrow. - How is Beatriz? - She's fine, thanks. He said: "See you tomorrow"... Maybe it was just a figure of speech... Or maybe it wasn't. "See ya"... "Bye"... - "Take care"... - Do you like him, is that it? Tomorrow, I'm going to buy a blue skirt! In the Algarve? In the Algarve? In the Algarve. KISS BAR BLACK NIGHT What? Misha fell in the pool? At the wedding? - And...? - Dinner. Now! Bitches! All the memories will follow me wherever I may go Dance along with me the sun and the sea. Only love... Excuse me, will you join us for a coffee? I'm fine, thanks. Me first! CALL TO A TENANTS MEETING Damn! - Seven plus two, us, nine. - Impossible... Mr. Amílcar was were... - ...for the last meeting. - He's not here today. I have to go, sorry. I have to go. My parents couldn't make it and they asked me to come instead. Are they alright, Rita? Yes they are, Noémia. They're in the Algarve. I came back earlier because I have a doctor's appointment. But everything is fine. Well, we better start. Rita has to go to bed early. First of all, because this is a recent topic that requires immediate action, I would like to inform the tenants that are unaware of what happened that the car belonging to our new neighbour, Filipe Mesquita, was stolen from the parking lot. - It hasn't shown up yet? - Burglars... It's the first time this happens in the building. - We all regret your misfortune, Mr. Mesquita. - Thank you. This is not the kind of welcome we like to give our new neighbours. It's those bastards who are running around busting up mail boxes. - Those are kids. Kids don't steal cars. - I bet they don't... For a few months now, I have been noticing there's a group of young people that gather around the parking lot. I don't know if there's any relation, but they are not from around here. Are you talking about the ones that play loud music on their phones? - That's right, neighbour. - Those are junkies! And the smell?! And they paint the walls with those doodles that are unreadable. Those are kids. Kids or not, they are old enough for a good thrashing! We've already asked for quotations to put some bars around the parking lot. Well done! They can be rude in their own neighborhood. The prices differ according with the type of solution we choose. Let me see... An electric gate with one remote control is around 4,500 euros... - Preposterous! - Maintenance included. But we also need a regular door! With all due respect, that won't accomplish anything! These hooligans know how to jump fences! I would rather hire a security guard. Preferably one with a uniform. I'm going to talk to Matos and we'll get a pair of shotguns... Before we continue with the voting process, I have to inform all tenants there will be an inevitable increase of the contribution fees for next year. So, we have three options: a fence with a regular gate, which means getting out of the car to open it... A fence with an electric gate, which is more expensive and requires an additional door for people to put out the trash. Lastly, hiring a security guard... This meeting is cancelled. This is impossible, I can no longer see Mr. Lopes! Mr. Amilcar's check. Preposterous! 4,500 euros because of those bastards... I'll take care of them. Starting with tonight! Did you see that, neighbour? - Seems we will be living in a prison. - Those people aren't real. Most of the tenants don't come anymore. I can understand them. Is everything OK? Huh? Yes. I think I'll go take some pictures... Good night, Rita. Good night... I'll join you. May I? Do you have a camera? You won't notice me. I'll be damned... Do you have anything to do with this? I think I do... Are you involved with those hooligans who smoke pot in the parking lot? Not quite. This is serious. Don't be like that. It went well. How do I know it went well? Because I'm telling you so. You're also telling me the car parked on its own. And why would I lie to you? I don't know. But you're not in a condition to decide things on your own. Next time you want to talk to him, you tell me first, OK? OK. I'll tell you. He asked me to help him pack up the exhibition. May I? What?! Of course you may! This is awesome! - Come on, do it. - What is the question? Is Rita crazy? Yes, yes. Again. "Paranoia". - I told you so. - Another question! Is John From interested in Rita? Come on, you have to do it. That piece of shit is wrong! You can't insult the oracle! I'm sorry... Let's do it again. It's against the rules... ...but OK. - That's enough! - Wait. I'll show you. Is Filipe interested in Rita? It died. Have you tried to charge it? Yes. What happened to it? I don't know. I was skipping songs and, puff, it was gone. I have to see. Thanks, Nuno. Here's your map. - Thank you, Mr. Pimentel. - You're welcome. - Is this bothering you? - No, that's fine. Rita... I'm glad the mist has lifted. It was all so weird. I also prefer it this way. Now you have to remain calm. This mango tastes great. Why wasn't I informed of the tenants' meeting? I asked you a question! I know I shouldn't have done that. I'm good. I'm sorry. It's working. Great! I didn't do anything. It must have been the mist. Thanks, Nuno. ALL FOR YOU Come in. You look nice. I want you home early, you know that? Yes, father. - See you, Paulo Rodrigo. - See you, Paulo Rodrigo. Are you afraid of me? No. Do you want to come live with me? Yes. Were you ever sick? No. Tomorrow, I'll go talk to your father. Isn't this wonderful? It is. Now you should pay the bill. Rita? IT WILL COME FROM THE SKY IN YOUR AREA, I RULE - Then we went to Paredes de Coura. - It was great, wasn't it? - Yes. What about Boom? - It was amazing. - The artists tore it up... - I've heard about it. Are you good? Yes. Will you make my daughter happy? Yes. Within eight days she must return here. If she's not happy, she will leave you. THE END
