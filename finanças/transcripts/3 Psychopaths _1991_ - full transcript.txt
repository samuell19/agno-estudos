3 PSYCHOPATHS I forgot my watch. - Let's get to work, guys. - Come on, guys. - Can I carry something? - Where is the car? We're ready. Where are we going, Christian? Not very far. We'll be there in about 30 minutes. I hope they're not going too far, I'm starting to get hungry. Shut up, you'll be less hungry. Stop arguing or you won't eat tonight. We're already skipping lunch. Let's celebrate this weekend in the countryside with a bit of music. Listen to these nutters. Which radio are you listening to? Supersky. Here we go! We're lucky, young people are tastier. And their skin is tender, so easier to prepare. And easier to cut up. And no need to sharpen the knife so no problem. I don't give a shit about your knife problems. Exactly. You're the one doing the cooking. OK, fine. When did we last go hunting? Too long ago. I've forgotten the taste of fresh meat. I'm so fed up eating vegetables. Vegetables are healthy. ..And the woman replies, "It's not my breasts, it's my bum!" Tell us another joke. - Fuck, not now! - Wait, I'll go and see what's wrong. I'll stay in the car. Shit! I don't believe it! I'll check what the problem is. Stop it! Is no one going to give me the tools? I don't have any tools. I only have a knife. I can't find any tools. Pass me whatever you can find. Here you are. I'm glad we're here. You forgot the bread. - All you think about is eating. - Well, yes. A woman can carry this. Here. Here, take that. I'm not carrying anything. I'll just watch you. - Where are we going? - Over there. Did you bring a blanket? It's not great. Come here. That's it. Shit, the radio. Take this, I'll get the radio. Can you get my shawl? Fine. - See you there. - OK. Look what the last people left! Here! They haven't left much! Let's have a drink. Can I have a drink, please? I'd like some too. I'll open the bottle. - Cheers everyone! - Cheers! Here's to us! You need eye contact. Is that better? - Let's do it again next year. - Look me in the eye. You should try the grass! What an idiot. If I were you, I'd give up. - Can I come too? - See you later! Behave yourselves. I'll be more comfy without it. You wanted to tell me something? - Yes. - What was it? Did you hear that? It sounded like Emmanuelle. I think you're right. Let's go and see what's going on. - Are you coming with us? - No, it's OK. Take your dog. Come, Fakir. - Emmanuelle? - Pierre? - Emmanuelle? - Pierre? I've fed up of looking for them. They're probably back with the others. You're right. Let's go back. Come on, Fakir. You little slut! You're a good boy. You're free. I got her. What? Pick up the knife. Pick it up. They left a while ago. - Let's go and look for them. - OK. The day is ruined, we'll come back another time. - Let's go. - Let's pack up. Take this. - Give it to me. - It's heavy. Give it here. Stop it! Are we going home? We put the stuff away and then we go. I wonder where they went. They fell into a hole. - Honestly... - Who the hell broke the table? Not me! - Hurry up! - What's the rush? It's a pigsty in here! Let's go look for them. - Can we go now? - Let's go. You go this way and we'll go that way. Scream if you find them, OK? - It's so quiet here. - That's for sure. Stephane? Stephane, where are you? Stop messing about! Where are you? Hello? What an arsehole. As if looking for the others wasn't already a pain. Is that you, Stephane? You scared me, you arsehole! Don't do that again. Sorry, I won't do it again. Kiss me and I'll forgive you. We have to go look for the others. - Come. - They can't be far. Bloody hell! Fuck! - Florence! - Christian! - Pierre! - Emmanuelle! Where the fuck are they? Hiding in that fucking forest. They're really pissing me off. - Pierre! - Emmanuelle! Where the fuck are you? Who are they? What are they doing here? I don't know, is it fancy dress time? Who does this dickhead think he is, talking to us like that? Look out, they're armed. Stop messing about, guys. Don't piss me off or I'm going to lose it. Knock yourself out. Take that, you bitch! - Go on. - Take that. We're leaving that one here, she's dead. I'm going to kill you. Bastard! Let's tie him up so he doesn't get away. His hands. Let's go eat, guys. We're done. Food's up! Let's carry him. - Sorry. - You should be, you little fuck! Calm down, we said sorry. We didn't break anything. Fucking kids! Drive! Not another fucking kid! The wanker is taking the piss. - What is he doing? - Look. I can't stand those kids. Run him over! Come here, you! No, please! Please let me go! Hold his feet. Look, guys! No, please! Where the fuck is my knife? Did you forgot I'm the chef? You arseholes! Let's have some fun with the kid. Come on, Rene, have fun. Use the knife. Suffering can be beautiful. Here you are, little shit. Have a nice ride. Something's missing. What? It's nice here. - A bench to lie down. - No need for that. Look, we're surrounded by nature. - It would be nice to lie down. - We're fine. It would be better than against the tree. - I like it here. - You don't think so? Anywhere with you is perfect. Understand? I want you. - Here? Now? - Yes. Against the tree? - Why not? - No. It's nice here. We're all alone. - What do you think? - We're all alone? Even if we weren't alone, - I'd keep on going. I love it. - It turns you on. - We can't even shower. - Your skin is soft. I want you. You're handsome. Stop the car, I need a piss. - So soon? - Stop the car! I want you. Hey, lovebirds! What about me? Get lost, you arsehole! I don't need help. Calm down, darling. Help! Shut up or I'll cut your tits off. Now kiss your boyfriend. - Please no! - Do it now! Just do it, for fuck's sake! Now kiss him. Stop this nonsense! Kiss him! I'll slit your throat, you bitch. Isn't that nice? Please don't! - We're going to have a nice time. - Don't! I'm begging you. What is he doing? Bloody hell! All done, my dear. You've relieved me. What's taking him so long? What took you so long? I really needed to pee. Did you do something else you're hiding from us? Does it matter? Drive! I heard a woman screaming as if she was being raped. It was nothing. - We just wanted... - Shut up. I really enjoyed that kid hanging like a scarecrow. I bet you had a hard-on. I was so hard I wanted to stick it up his arse and stir up his shit. Great, we'll have more to eat. Are you moving out? Setting off to new horizons? You're right to get a change of air. Where are you going? We're not moving out, Miss Martine. Aren't you? What's inside? We're stocking up for the third world war. You're right to stock up. You never know what to expect nowadays. You're absolutely right. I still need to sweep, clean the kitchen and iron. And then I must go see my friend in the hospital. She broke a leg falling down the stairs. Isn't that silly? Anyway, bye. Good luck! - Bye, Miss Martine. - Don't work too hard. See you soon. What a headache, that woman! I'm knackered. We'll get the others later, alright? It's fine by me. Great! What should we do to her? Anything as long as she suffers. Can I rape her, guys? Calm down! They are special guests, Alfred. We have to be welcoming. Come here. Let's put her on the table. Come here. Stay there. Stop moving. - No! - Yes. - Just like a frog. - Hold her hand. It's OK. Give me the knife. Here. Come here. Now you're going to confess or... You're going to scream, "I worship evil. "I worship Satan and the blood pouring on me. "I love fresh meat." We'll try afterwards. You'll see, it's tasty. Now repeat what I ordered you to say. Come on. I worship evil. Louder. - Satan. - Scream. I worship blood. - You do. - Stop! - Arthur, gag her so she doesn't scream. - You're right. Look how it's done! This is nice. - So nice. - She's bleeding. It's good. Look at that. Look. Give me a nail. Any will do. Give me those fucking pliers. Here. Taste it, Alfred. This shit is disgusting. Really? Let's try another one. She's pissing me off. - It's coming off. - It's cracking. Look, another one. Blood! - I'm not eating it. - You're not? Last one. Give me your nail, you bitch. Give me your nail. Relax! Here's the last one. Did you see it? Did you see it? Piece of shit! This is going to be fun, you'll see. Go on, Alfred. I'm going to carve you up, lovely. That's nice. - It's good. - It is, isn't it? It's so good. - Should we go get the others? - OK, let's go. - Do you need me, guys? - Stay here. So nice. Put her here. Come on, guys. I need a chain. Let's go get the other. Get rid of the corpse. You're heavy. Shut the fuck up, arsehole! Leave it. Piece of shit. This one is heavier. Much heavier. - Pliers! - Here you go. Knife. - Knife. - And the saw. Go on. Are there any left? That's all for now. We can start the proceedings. I'm going to prepare dinner. Meat is very fatty these days. I'll only keep the good meat. I'll hold him and you'll take his eyes out. Good idea. We're going to take your fish eyes out! - Help! - Shut up! It's not fair, you're chatting while I'm working my arse off. Shut up! You're never happy. It's the best part. That's shit. If you pull his eyes out, what do I do with this? I'm so happy. How beautiful! This guy's pretty resilient. Even better! I love when they resist, it turns me on. Pass me the scissors. I'll take care of this one now. I can't wait for what's coming next. - Everything OK, butcher? - The butcher is covered with blood. Beautiful. It's magnificent. Is it OK if I continue preparing dinner? I can't wait to take care of this frigid bitch. - Pass me the grinder. - Wait, I'll go get it. Here you go. I have something in store for you. - You're going to scream. - There. She's going to scream. Scream, you bitch! Bloody hell! Let's take him back. Shit. Wait. What a pain in the arse. Fuck! Shit, the door. Son of a bitch. The motherfucker tried to escape. You'll pay for the trouble you caused us. Isn't this exciting? - Shut the fuck up and cook. - Shut up, dickhead! That's great! So beautiful. The fucker is taking his time. You're going to suffer, bastard. Shut the fuck up! I'm the lord. - He's still breathing. - Good. - Dinner is ready. - Coming! We don't need a plate. You're not killing this one? Leave him be, we'll see how long he lasts. Pass me the hand. What are we going to do with those two? We'll think about it later. We did bad things today. No one would approve. But when I think about people eating chicken and killing pigs just to eat them... I don't understand why they kill those creatures. - We might as well eat humans. - You're right. Men were put on this earth to be eaten by civilised people. We shouldn't kill animals. They are our equals. I'm happy to see this. I can't believe some arseholes kill frogs just to eat their legs. We kill slowly, it lasts longer. - I had a nice meal. - Me too. Don't worry, we'll kill you too. OK, let's hurry, guys. Shut up, you slut! We don't want to get found out. Who is it? Hello, sorry to bother you. It's no bother. How can we help? I was passing by with my baby. Shush! I heard some noise and I was wondering if it came from your place. Did you hear anyone scream? - Not me. - Me neither. Are you sure? Stay here. What is that? Can't you see? It's the leftovers from our dinner. Come here, baby. Here, baby. Little baby. I need the crib. Look guys, he's so cute. The little guy is so cute. Hello. We should sing him a nice song. He's cute, but he's still a human. So are we. What are you talking about? We look like them but we are not humans. We are not humans, I tell you! I'm so angry. I'll kill him. You crazy bastard. I won't kill you like you killed my friends. You don't get it. You killed my friends and their wives. You even wanted to kill that baby. I was fulfilling Satan's orders. You don't get what happened today, you idiot! I wanted to see evil at work and it makes me happy to see it. It's over. Please let's go. - Where do you want to go? - I don't know. Call the police. They'll never believe us. Why not? It's not that simple. They'll never believe us. How do we explain what happened? They'll throw us in jail. The three guys might surrender. I doubt it. Move, you idiot! Don't you know evil always wins, you moron? Let her go, you bastard! Take that. Look at this beautiful thing. From now on, he is our son. He will help us carry out Satan's mission.
