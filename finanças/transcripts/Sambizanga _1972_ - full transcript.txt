On February 4th 1961, a group of militants set out from Sambizanga, a working-class district in Luanda, intending to storm the capital's prison. At the same time, they gave the signal for the armed struggle for national independence that has engulfed Angola ever since. But for years before that day, thousands of fighters in the villages and towns had braved the police's reign of terror, patiently paving the way for insurrection and organizing a clandestine network of political movements. And so, on a work site in the midst of the Angolan bush, we find a certain Domingos Xavier... Trouble, Domingos? Yes, a flat tire. We'll talk at my place tonight. Okay? You know Mr. Sylvester? He talks to you? Yes, he says I'm a good tractor driver. Where he goes, I go. Listen to me but... don't repeat this. I swear not to tell a soul. I know the Whites well. That White's our friend. Remember that. Okay? Maria, where you goin'? I'm looking for Domingos. Don't worry, he'll be back. Thanks, I was hungry. You're home late. It's because of Timoteo. Who's Timoteo? The driver on the night shift. So what happened today? Nothing to tell me? You mad at me? More sauce? Give me water, please. Thanks. A new Luanda leaflet to distribute. "To all Angolan compatriots: "Day after day new pains are added to our mutual suffering. "Hunger in our homes, poverty in our huts, "forced labor on the road gangs. "All this is due to Portuguese colonialism. "To end foreign exploitation and domination in our land "we must strengthen our Movement's organization! "Create secret groups, "organize ourselves in order to fight better." See you later! Are you okay? Continue! Let's get that man, fast! Tie him up good! Shut up! You know what you've done, right? Courage! You must go. My son says so. Your son Sousinha? - So he's back? - It's a secret. He's always here. He says you're to go to the Administration with Bastião. Cry and make the baby cry. They'll tell you where he is. Here are your things. You can go. Be brave! My marble! Gimme my marble! Grampa, there's a prisoner! Come quick! A prisoner? You saw him with your own eyes? I saw him! He walked like this! He walked all tied up! You were right to come and tell me as I told you to do. Let's go tell Chico. There goes Old Half-Ass! There goes Old Half-Ass! You really don't know him? No! Never saw him in the museke. This the right road? No, this way. I know how to get there. Say you want to go before Quinta. Hurry up or we'll miss Chico. He goes out every morning. Hello, brother, I'm looking for Chico, his godfather wants him. Chico Kafundanga, he plays for Bota. He's gone out. Already gone out? He left with the receipt book, he's distributing some letters. - When'll he be back? - I've no idea. When he comes in, tell him his godfather's waiting at the dock. I'll give your message... to Mr. Francisco Kafundanga. Before the ferry came, there were lots of fish here. You threw a hook in and hauled out big ones. Throw back the little ones. You take him off the hook... like this... and toss him back in and that way... you'll catch bigger ones. Fish are really dumb! Hi! You wanted to see me? I wanted to see you. I've got important news. Zito, you're a man now! How you've grown! I've a lot to tell you. I'm free for an hour. Let's go eat. Okay? Here's something you don't know. This morning a prisoner arrived in the museke. The boy saw him. A prisoner? They put a man in prison. What's he like? Big and strong. They tied him up with ropes, he walked like a calf. How'd he arrive? In a Landrover. Zito knows the number. A land rover, ABC 27-29. Let me write that down. Was someone seated in the car? A White in a white uniform? He wore a white uniform but... when he passed, they called him "Mr. Aspirante". I understand. You're a bright boy. We're sorry you're not in school but we'll do... all we can to get you back in again. If you hear anything about this prisoner, let me know it right away! Hello, Mame Sessa. We don't see you much, Chico. I'm looking for Miguel. You want Miguel? Wait! Is Bebiana there? I thought she was in town at the seamstress' place. That didn't work out very good for her. She's spent the week with us. But Miguel broke his arm. They say he broke it fishing... but I don't believe that. More likely down by Fernando's store, down there he fights with the mulattos. You know, the kids of the White who has some boats. He wants Miguel. Go on! You eating here? Bebiana, go see Miguel. He's at Mr. Vicente's. Go get him and come eat. Back again! We never see you. Don't say that… you know... Yes, I do. I hear you been dancing with Carlotta. It's not like that. You know I love only you. Liar! My word of honor! I swear it! There's only you, but you know... I'm no longer like I used to be. Since meeting Mussunda, I think with my head. If I say I love you, it's really true. How can I believe you? You're seen all the time, dancing with Carlotta! Forget all that gossip! If you don't believe me, ask Miguel! He knows. I'm glad to see you. Yesterday I spoke to Vicente about you. Hello, Vicente. Hello. Still dancing in the bars every night? No, that's all over with. Miguel must've told you I'm going to marry Bebiana. Are you crazy? You treat women like old rags! That'll teach you! Miguel, I must talk to you. I'll wait for you on the rocks. Any news? Bad news. They've arrested someone. You got his name? No, nobody knows him at the museke. Seen him? Zito saw him. He says he's big. How'd he arrive? In a Landrover. A police car. We got the number, Tell me! ABC 27-29. A Luanda license number. I'll ask Mussunda to find out who it is. What do you want? I want to find my man. I want to see the Secretary. He's out. When'll be back? He'll be here soon. Wait a while. The Secretary is out. Be patient. It's Maria. She wants to see you. What is it? Quick! I want my man. You arrested him. Domingos is a bandit. Why a bandit? If you don't want any trouble, go home. My man! Domingos! Stop screaming! I won't, you shitty turncoat! You're with the Whites! You make all of us suffer! Mr. Aspirante took him to Luanda. Why Luanda? He hadn't hurt anyone. They said Domingos wanted to kill all the Whites. Not true, but the Secretary, the Aspirante... Joao and Mandumbo took him to Luanda. Domingos don't know any Whites! Don't yell! Mr. Aspirante will beat me like they did Domingos. They beat him? You're making up stories! Go to the Luanda police. You'll find him. Maybe the secret police. Go see Mame Tete at the museke, she'll tell you. It's me! Maria! I wanna see Mame Tete! Me, Maria Xavier and my baby Bastião. Something terrible made me come! My man's been arrested! Come in! I'm going to the police station with Bastião. One of the boys will go with you. I'm going to work. Show Maria the way to the police station. See you tonight. Joãozinho, come play! There's the police station. Where's the Administrator? That way, but he'll make you wait. You ain't from Luanda, huh? The Administrator, please. He's out, he's only here for important things. Who can I see? The Secretary. Thank you, it's a very important matter. Sit down. The Secretary will be here. Soon? Don't you see how hot it is? You live in Luanda or the museke? You want to see me? Yes, I'm looking for my man, Domingos Xavier, a construction worker at Dondo. They took him, and... Who arrested him? Mr. Aspirante brought him to Luanda... in a car. Wait a moment! Such heat! It's really gonna rain! You going back to Dondo tonight? They didn't bring him here. You said Domingos? Domingos Xavier. No... unless he's a political prisoner. My man's not in any politics. He must be at the city police station. Know where it is? No, it's my first time in Luanda in 12 years. Ask any fellow citizen. He must be there. In the center of town... just go straight ahead. If you wanna wait for me at the exit at noon... That's what Luanda's like? Not even all our construction people... could fill these streets! So many people and houses! Is that Mutamba Square? Yes, that's it, I know the city. But where's the statue with nobody? And the big trees? No, it's not Mutamba Square. Maybe you call it like that... but Mutamba's not here. Yes, Maria, I swear it! It's Mutamba Square. The police station's over there. You're right. You go home now. - I wanna find my man! - Shit! Bastard! I don't understand life any more. Bananas, manioc, everything is so expensive. Stop! You should know... there are no Whites... no Mulattos or Blacks. Only the Rich and the Poor. The Rich are the Poor's enemies. They see to it that the Poor stay poor. How, Mussunda? The Rich give work, money... charity offerings. Without the Rich, the Poor'd have no work. 'Course not, Maneco. The Rich give in a way that keeps the Poor poor... and work to keep the Rich rich. If there were no Rich, there's be no Poor. We'd all be the same. If the money of the Rich sleeps, does that earn them more money? No, impossible! It's the labor of the Poor that earns money for the Rich and makes the Rich richer. But the Poor? Always in the same fix! Who is it? Me! Miguel! Two students... a friend. So long, Mussunda. What's up? Bad news... they've arrested one of ours, I don't know who. Brought to the museke in a Landrover... license ABC 27-29. He's big and strong but... nobody knows him at the museke. You're going on a mission. There's many prisons... and we're all under surveillance. The police want to smash our groups. We must know the prisoner's name. Big and strong... I can't imagine who... If he was thin, it could be Sousinha. Contact the group chief and come back. Okay. I almost forgot... the big party Saturday night... With a good band, maybe even the Ngola, without all the extras. If all goes well, see you Saturday. It'll go alright. Don't be afraid, we won't hurt you. Only ask you some questions. Sign it. Can you write? Sign and you can go. Sit down! Sign and you can go home. Your woman's waiting outside. We're not gonna hurt you. Just answer me, that's all! The police know everything! Don't try to be smart! We know you're a good, hard-working tractor driver. Your job's waiting for you. Your boss has asked about you already. So it's all up to you. Copy this down, Pereira. Do you know Bernardo de Sousa? Don't know him. That's a bad beginning. Everyone knows you know him. And your pal Timoteo? Don't know him. You'll make me angry. We know everything, so talk! Talk, you animal! Calm down. He's gonna talk. He's tired and scared, we must realize that. Who else is in your group? You don't know them? Bring us a beer and two sandwiches. Ask Mr. Oliveira to pay. You're wrong, fella. I'm giving you a chance to go home. Who's the white man? The one who helps you? Don't know any Whites. You're lucky the chief's feeling fine today, otherwise he'd really fix you up! Filthy nigger! You've never met? I know him, he knows the white man! Him and Sousinha. See? I'm trying to help you. So who's the White? Easy, Pereira! You don't know who the White is? Your wife's here but if you won't talk... Sit down! Put him back in his cell! Tell his wife out there that she can leave. Her man will never leave here! Here, drink! Here, eat! Bastard! You thought you'd get a beer! Put him in his cell! Nothing to eat or drink till he talks. Madam, you don't know me... but I'd like to talk to your son. I've a message from Luanda for him. My boy! Nobody knows nothin' since he left! If I knew, I'd tell you. But in my heart, I know he'll come back. Madam, listen to me. I've travelled all night from Luanda, I've an important message for him. A friend's found him a job in town. If you're my son's friend, help me with the laundry and have lunch. I heard they arrested a guy. Yes, a neighbor. Domingos. A good husband... The police took him away one morning. What's his name? Domingos Xavier. He's a tractor driver. I don't know him. Domingos Xavier? Our life is truly miserable. Someday everything'll be fine, and you'll see your son Sousinha again Be brave, comrade. Don't tell them anything. They don't know anything. Be brave. Timoteo. Mr. Aspirante, a lady asks to see Domingos Xavier. Show her in! He's not here. All those from the construction sites are sent to the other jail. No, the Secretary told me to come here. Would he lie to you? Go see the other police station. Ready to talk? I hate stubborn guys. We warned you. If you don't talk nice, we'll make you talk, bastard! Chief, he's still conscious. Just one question: who's the white man? The man working with you? Don't know... anything. I saw her! She went into the prison. You really saw her? You talk to her? No, I didn't. But what if she doesn't come out? Make a bed for yourself! He looks like he's asleep. He was our friend, our comrade, who's gone off into the night. He is dead. Let us never forget him There goes Old Half-Ass! My man! They killed him! They beat him to death! Don't cry. Take care of your baby. Comrade Petelo! Brother Domingos was beaten to death. Zito told me. Domingos is dead? When? I don't know. Zito told me about it today. Fellow countrymen of Angola! I've just learned one of our brothers has been killed. Domingos Xavier. I interrupted to tell you this, but let us continue because we are joyful. He behaved like a true nationalist, he said nothing of the Movement. This is a day of mourning, but also a day of joy, for Domingos and his companion Maria. Do not cry over his death. Today Domingos begins his real life, in the hearts of Angola's people. We came to tell you... Domingos Xavier died in prison. How? He was tortured but didn't talk. Not a word right to the end. It'll take more courage. Take his place as leader of the construction group. We must spread the Movement... get support in the country... for our work in the cities. The secret police wants to take the prisoners to Tarrafal. So the Movement has decided to free our comrades. The date is set: February 4th. Subtitling: L'Immagine Ritrovata
