These are my friends, Jerry and Marge Selbee. They live in Evart, Michigan. It's a small town that's not exactly in its prime. Though, to be honest, neither are Jerry and Marge. Today, they're on their way to buy lottery tickets. Lots and lots of lottery tickets. But they're not hoping to get lucky. You see, they don't need luck. But this story doesn't start there. It starts with Jerry, getting up before dawn just like he has every day for 42 years, going to work at the Corn Flakes factory, for what he fears will be the last time. It's a math problem, really. If you count the letters, uh, except the letter "I," which they skip because it looks like a "1", then you realize that "J" is February. And then, the last letter... Oh, boy. That designates the plant code, which was not easy to figure out, but, uh... I did. Jerry, you don't have to work so hard. You're retiring. Well, yeah. But... I... I don't have to be. Um... I know my line is shutting down, but... You know, I have a thing with numbers. Come on. You've served your time. These are your golden years. He's the best line manager we ever had, right? Absolutely. Hey. Why don't you tell these guys how you started working here in high school? You worked nights, right? To Jerry.- All right. Not everybody can pull off 42 years without getting fired. And now you have a boss who's going to let you sleep in. And won't yell at me. Wrong about that.Oh. You know, you should get your real estate license, just like Howard did. It's like having a job. But it's also like being retired, because you don't do anything. It's true. Most days, I don't even leave the house. Well... You know, I'll make it work. You know, I can always help Marge around the house. No, you don't need to do that. No, I'd be happy to. I mean, you've been taking care of this place for years. I kind of have a system. Oh, yeah, and a good one. But, you know, every system can use an improvement. Oh, God. Here we go. Hey. I got an idea. Yeah? Why don't I try consulting on some of your job sites? You know, find ways of making things run better.Ah. You wanna walk around on my construction site and tell me what I'm doing wrong? Oof. I wouldn't charge much. Oh, and I have to pay you for this? Darn right.- Are you going to also come by and teach my wife how to grade papers? Hey, Dad, if I lived here, I would welcome that. Thank you, Dawn. I'm gonna take you up on that. I'm gonna drive down to Grand Rapids more often. Oh, whoops. You sold it too well. Shut up. Backfired right in your face. Yeah, sweetie? Okay. Can we show Pop Pop? Uh, yeah, you wanna show Pop Pop right now? Show me what? We got you a retirement present.- Surprise. Okay. Open your eyes.- Open. Holy cow! A fishing boat. What... Do I like fishing? I do? Okay. Yeah, you took me once. Yeah, now you can go whenever you want. Yeah, how about that? This is great. Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you.- Oh, good. Oh.- Dad likes it. And you, for keeping a secret. Thank you, pumpkin. Thank you, Doug. You like it? Yeah.- All right. My goodness. My goodness.- Good job. You didn't spoil it. That was your one job. You did so good. You okay? Oh, yeah. Yeah. I don't have many regular clothes. It's all work shirts. Well, we can get you more clothes. Hmm. It'll be an adjustment. You'll find your way. Hmm. Have you? Not really. But I don't have a boat. You want this one? Nope. Morning, Leon. Morning, Jerry. Card was declined, Helen. I'm sorry. Dang it. Maybe I have cash. Let me just... I know you're good for it. Thanks, Leon. What are you doing out here? My appointment is at-00. No, you said you'd come at-00. I don't have any other appointments. I have six clients. Okay. How do you make a living with only six clients? I don't. I just became an online travel agent. See the posters? Oh, yeah. So, why do you need posters if it's online? Because they were free. Why do you always have to understand the reasoning behind everything? Oh, well. It's the only way I can make sense of things. How's the boat? Water's still too cold. You don't get in the water. That's the point of the boat. Hmm. How's my account? Speaking of cold... 2% gains, which doesn't sound like much, because it isn't. Look, you gotta be more aggressive. If you let me put that in stocks, I could probably get you 10%. That would double your money in only... 7.27 years. Literally the only time I was going to get to use that today. Nope. This is all we've got. And I'm not about to gamble with it. It's not gambling. It seems like a risk, but the market... Yeah, well, if you could lose it, it's gambling. I'll call you in a month for my next appointment. Don't need an appointment.Okay. Take out the boat. I may just do that. Oh! No. Holy cow! Hey, Jer. What's a roll down?- It's when the jackpot hits two million and nobody gets six numbers. Then the whole jackpot rolls down to the people who got three or four... Whatever. Just better odds. Good luck. Yeah.Thanks. Better odds. Can that be right? All right. It's not gambling. The lottery? Yup. There's a way to win every time. Are you having a stroke? There's a loophole they didn't see, and it's right here in the math. Now, on a typical drawing, you'd have a one in 54 chance of hitting three out of six numbers, and a one in 1,500 chance of hitting four. Odds are you'll lose every time. Not every time. I won a free ticket last week, which lost. But on the roll down weeks, the payouts to the lower numbers increases above the amount that you would pay to play. So, the math is in your favor. And they missed it. I don't know what this says. Looks like the numbers a crazy man drew on his cell wall. It means that on the roll down weeks, you're guaranteed to win. That can't be true. Why not? Because it's the lottery, Jerry. There's a building of people in Detroit whose job it is to know how the numbers work. And they do. I cannot believe you are my accountant. Part-time accountant. Full-time online travel agent. Hey, Mindy. Hey, Jerry. Making a deposit? Uh, no... I... I'd like to withdraw $2,000. Yep. So, how are your feet? Been better. Rolling the tennis ball helped, until my manager tripped on it and threw it into the street. I can bring you another one. They come in threes.Thanks. Oh, thank you. I'll be back in a couple of days with a deposit. Okay. Oh. Probably be 20% more than this. Give or take. See you then.Okay. Thank you. Okay. Have a good day. Two thousand WinFall tickets. Two thousand? Yes, ma'am. Good evening, folks, and welcome to this week's WinFall lottery roll down. Grab your tickets, have a seat and let's get right to it. The first lucky number is six. The second number... Twenty-three. You okay? Oh, yeah. Never better. Forty-three. So, how'd it go with the boat? Oh, uh... They said they can fix the motor, but it's not for me. I mean, we're supposed to be doing stuff together anyway, right? Thirty-one. You want to watch a movie?- The next winning number is... Oh... No, I didn't mean right now.- Ten. Well, so, when? Well, I don't know. I'm watching a program. You're watching this? No. Forty-three, 31, 10, and 32. And we hope you're a winner. One... That's one's four. Twenty-one, 28. Sixteen. Problem is, nobody knows about this town. Evart should start selling houses for a dollar, like they do in Tuscany. Lure people here. We can live in Tuscany for a dollar? Well, a Euro. That's a dollar. No, a little more than that. Jerry, how much is a Euro? Jerry. Oh. Sorry. Mmm. Full house. We're playing gin. Oh. Thank you so much.- All right. Well, goodnight. Goodnight.- Take care. Have a good walk home.- Okay. Gin, or poker, or cribbage, I get confused by them all.- You don't care. You don't care. Scrabble. Scrabblenext. All right, night. You're going to have to tell me what's going on. I'm too old to wait it out. Oh... I missed my chance. I did everything I was supposed to do. Everything I had to do. Now it's too late to do anything else. Oh, your life isn't over. Everybody seems to think it is. Well... Heck, I can do anything. I'd still be at the factory if they didn't cut my line. But instead... These are my golden years. Yeah, just because things didn't work out the way you wanted, doesn't mean they won't. Good luck happens, same as bad. What? Good luck, it happens same as bad? Yeah. It's just math.Yeah. What? Oh, man. What a dummy. Not you. Me. You're a genius. Sample size. That is where I went wrong. I didn't calculate the frequency of probability. It's just math. Oh, I don't like math. Oh. Oh, I'm sorry. Here, let me show you... Here. So, if you take a coin and you flipped it 1,000 times, you might still get 60% heads. But if you flipped it 5,000 times, the probability gets closer to 50%. The sample has to be large enough to take luck out of the equation. And this is for you. Are you depositing a penny? No. No. No. Uh... I wanna make a withdrawal. $4,200. Oh, and how much does that leave us with? I am checking. A little over four. Okay. Make it six, then. Six? Mmm-hmm. Eight? Eight?$8,000. Are you sure? Hmm. Ninety-eight. Ninety-nine. Eight thousand. Thank you, Midge. There we go. Bye-bye. You know, every town has a thing. We need a thing. What happened to jazz fest? Well, we couldn't keep the stage up to code. Oh, one of those clogger girls fell right through. Oh, yeah. Jazz fest made money, too. I mean, not that year, because the girl sued us.Yeah. She was upset 'cause we were still clapping. We thought it was part of the show. Oh. By the way, a bunch of us are pooling money for the lottery tonight. They're doing that roll down thing, where you can win more. We're not lottery people.- That's probably for the best. You know, there are some people who blow thousands on those things? You all right?- Here we go. What's the matter? Take the drink.- Down the wrong pipe. Eating too fast. Yeah. Ooh. Four. Whoo. I mean, it's like a regular travel agent, but it's online, so people can act like animals when something doesn't work out. Hey, you should be traveling. You and Wendy used to go on all these cruises and come back and call everything port and starboard. I didn't even know which was which. Depends which ocean you're on. Hmm. No. No.- Yep. She'd want you to have fun. It's been three years. Oh, brats. Brats and burgers. All? With cheese on it.Okay. Brats and... Oh.- Cheddar? Doug, would you watch the grill for a second? See? This is a good time. Huh? Mmm. I told you it'd be worth the drive. No, you said you didn't know how many weekends you have left. Well, I don't. Yeah, but the math works. Drive for two hours, get a free burger. Offsets the cost of gas. I don't eat meat, Dad. Oh, right. I'll get the chicken. No, that's still meat. Okay. Is he okay? He just doesn't know the formula for "I miss you." It is more fun when you're here. I know, but you and Dad, you gotta have fun together. Yeah. I know you've waited a really long time for him to retire. I know. I know. We need to work on it. I can't even remember the last time that we had... You know? What? Yeah. Oh, no, that's okay. I don't need to hear about... Honey. I'm gonna get a beer. Okay? Okay. We'll work on it. I'm thinking about it anyway.- Okay. I wish he would. Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa! No, Lizzy, Lizzy, Lizzy! No, no, no, no, Liz. Let's not... Let's not open that. Why? I want the popcorn. I know. I know. But this... this popcorn's very stale. Ugh. I like stale. Well, but this is full of sugar. It's no good for you. I saw you eat seven Oreos. You want an Oreo? You ate them all, Pop Pop. Okay. All right. Uh... Let me just have it for one minute. Pop Pop will give it back to you. I promise. You trust Pop Pop now, right? Let me just take one minute. And I'll be right out. Here you go. Take. Thanks, Pop Pop. Yep. Something you wanna tell me? What? The pantry. I'm playing the lottery. I meant the empty bag of Oreos. I'm playing the lottery, and I'm winning. I figured out the math, and I won $15,000. It's stuffed inside the Frosted Mini-Wheats box. Wow. I gave $20 to Shirley's lottery pool. I guess it's not such a big deal now. I... I had to try it. I... I found this flaw in the game, and I had to find out if I was right. Well, why didn't you just tell me? I... felt silly. We barely have enough money to retire on as it is, and... This is no time to risk it. Yes, it is. What? It's time to risk it. Because right now we're losing something that matters even more. I've waited 40 years for it to be just us, and so far we kind of suck at it. We have Jeopardy. Oh, that's not a thing. Jerry! I wanna have fun. I wanna have fun. Let's be a little stupid. Huh? We got married when we were 17, so we know how to do it. Well, that's true. We need something for us. I didn't think it would be playing the lottery, but I'd rob a bank if it gave us something to talk about. Okay. $15,000?Yep. If we bet the whole $15,000... Oh, we should. Let's bet it all. You think? Yeah, 'cause I was thinking the same thing. It's right... No. No, no, no, no. Leon, what happened to WinFall? Oh, they... they phased it out. What? It's gone, just like that? You don't play anyway, do you? No.Yeah, well, I guess people will just have to play the one in Massachusetts now. The math works. You can see that. You're an accountant. Yeah. I mean... I mean, it looks right. And Massachusetts isn't that far. No, it's only about a 10-hour drive if our truck doesn't break down. If it does, we'll get a ride.Yeah. From whom? Truckers. Yeah, they're always looking for company. To murder. We'll jump out if it gets weird. And they won't even know that we have a duffle bag full of cash. Yeah, we'll keep that zipped up. All right. All right, what? I'm in, too. You sure?- No. But what the hell? Put me in for 1,000. I just got a cruise I gotta cancel now. Hey. Oh.Oh. Got our dinner. Yeah. We're going to need three days of food. Oh. And I found us a small town to play in. Yeah, keep things quiet. You know, like how I park a block away at a good garage sale. Yeah? Oh.Move. You got a ham radio? What? Ham radio. We're gonna hit some dead zones. I suppose I can go to Ace... Wait a minute. How are we on batteries? Uh... I... Ah. Okay. Let's get some more. Just in case. Feels like we really are robbing a bank. Nah. It's gonna be more fun. You take that. Here are the keys. All right. Aah. I got the coupons. All right. You grab that. Oh, now? Oh. Let's go.Oh. Can I get dressed first? Mmm.Whoo. You have cookies? Ooh. Doesn't look like much. Well, all we need is a ticket machine, right? Hey, kid, those are buy one, get one free, 'cause they're so out of date. They're from 2013, but they'll still turn your mouth blue. Actually, I'm gonna get them first. How can I help you? We'd like to buy 8,000 WinFall tickets. I'm gonna get you first. No way is this enough. There's no way that was enough. Uh... Eight thousand WinFall tickets is, like... $29,000. No. 16,000.$16,000. And that is how much we brought. Well, the machine prints 1,000 tickets an hour, so you'll be here all day. And let me tell you from experience, being here all day sucks. Because I'm here all day. Well, he's right. It's gonna take eight hours. I can do it. Let's get rolling. You want us? Yeah, come on. I got work to do. I'm busy. Well, can you show us how it works? You'll figure it out. Sorry, the motel's not so great. The Pick and Shovel. Perfect name. Because it's what you need to dig a grave. Hah. Reminds me of our wedding night. Huh? My dad gave me enough money to take you to the prom. But then I thought, "Heck, the prom ends at midnight, "but a marriage, that lasts forever. "And it's 20 bucks cheaper." Which you spent on a Days Inn. Oh, on our honeymoon.Yeah. Well, I'm glad we're being crazy. I'd sleep in the car if I had to. Well, you may have to. I don't think this door locks. Oh, it's on, Jerry. Oh, oh, oh, oh. All right. Oh, you have the... Cross those fingers, our very last lucky number is 21. Folks, those numbers, one more time, are 23, 45, 01, 25, 06 and 21. All right, folks, check those numbers. We wish you the best of luck. Hopefully this was your week.Okay. Well, we got 8,000 tickets to check. Let's get started. We'll probably see sunrise. The last one is a three-number winner. Oh, good. Okay. So we bet 16,000.Mmm-hmm. And the two number winners just gives us free tickets, so if we count those as a push... Which means we made... $21,043. Oh... I think we're gonna need more Oreos. Yeah, we're all... No, heck. There's a little piece left there for you. No.You sure you don't... No, thank you. They just said, "Congratulations." Huh. Of course they did. It's not against the rules to buy tickets. I thought an alarm would go off and they'd start yelling at me. So did I. Do you really think we're the only ones who know? Hey, why are there ultrasonic sensors on our toilet stalls? Bathroom vacancy grid. I got tired of walking in there and seeing feet under every stall. So, now I know that when the light is green, the toilet is... Well, not clean, but nobody is sitting on it. We're supposed to be doing our research projects. I am. Bathroom lights? No. That'd be stupid. I'm doing one on the lottery. Ah. That's way more stupid. It's not. I'm evaluating the exact odds of winning Power ball versus Mega Millions. Okay. Yeah, it's stupid. Whatever. I'll still get a B. What are these? The smaller state games. I need them for comparison. Sweet. The handicapped stall is open. Jerry, pull over. Come on, pull over. We're only a mile from home. No.You can't hold it? It's not that. Okay. Okay. Marge, how long is this gonna take? 'Cause I actually have to go. Did you ever think maybe the world wasn't passing you by? Maybe you were meant to be here. To work in the factory and to care about all these people the way you do, because the day would come when you could help them. What do you mean? Well, you said the more we bet, the better the odds. I did say that. So you wanna start a corporation? Bring in the whole town. If we sell shares, we'll have more capital to invest. Go big or go home. Then we'll split the profits with the shareholders. Everybody rides. Will you stop talking like that? Sorry. I'm just really into it. She's really into it. Because she knows it'll work. House always wins. Stop it. You really think people will come in on this? Yup. You did. Yeah, but I'm a depressed widower with nothing to live for. You wanna buy more shares, then? Yes! And that about does it. Any questions? So, uh, GS Investment Strategies? That's right. We've got a business license and everything. Not much of a name. Well, don't worry about the name. You need "lottery" in there somewhere. Well, the name's not important. It is if you wanna sell the idea. I took a class on marketing. Well, the idea sells itself. You buy a share for $500 and you make a profit. It's that simple. Do you have a logo? Don't need a logo. Logos help. I have a pig on a tractor. Yeah. Okay, look, you all have known me for years. This will work, and it'll help everybody. What if we want in, but we're behind on our bills, and don't have enough for a share? Do you accept other forms of payment? Like what? Wait, wait, wait. Got it all right here. Oh, we're in. I've never done anything criminal like this. No, Shirley, it's not criminal. We're gonna pay taxes on all the winnings and claim expenses. Jerry's got it all worked out. Your mother and I are going into business. Are you selling her toffee or something? No. We're gonna play the lottery. It's 500 a share.Okay. Oh, yeah? Okay? You don't wanna know details? No, no, no, I'm good. It sounds great. You can see in the first three plays Dad, Dad. That we've increased our profit. It's just not for me. I just don't understand this. It's just math. It's always just math. It's like sorting through coins, looking for buffalo nickels, because you had calculated there was, what, one in every seven rolls or something? Yeah. We made $600. We sorted through coins every weekend for a month. I was 12. It was fun. It would have been nice to just throw the football or something. Look, I'm... Hey, Doug? Doug, the Porters lost power in their barn and they want you to come take a look. All right. I'll be right there. Okay. I gotta go.Okay. Yup. I'll be in your business, Pop Pop. How are you at logos? Good. Well, come here and show Pop Pop. Here. Let me give you some paper. And you show me what you can do about drawing a logo for Pop Pop's business. If you wanna get that going, push your button. Right there. Push the button. Bill?- Hey, Jerry. Hey, Marge. Hi. Hey, uh, if we're gonna do this again, I'm gonna need to charge you for using the microwave. We are betting 40,000. You guys drug dealers? No. We're professional lottery players. I don't think that's a thing. It is now. Listen, as much as I'd like to see if you can stand behind that thing for that long without breaking a hip, there's no way you can buy that many tickets before closing time. Can you stay open later? Oh, I'm afraid not. I'm undergoing some marital trauma at the moment. Oh.Well, truth be told, tonight is a drinking celebration with my buddies. Now, admittedly we do it out there, in the parking lot, but, uh, I just can't have customers in here. It's a liability. Well... What if we weren't customers? I have no idea what you're talking about. What if we were partners? Bill, I'd like to introduce you to GS Investment Strategies. I'm in. Can I be in? So I'm a shareholder, and I could totally get you guys in if you want. So, it's a WinFall, so when the numbers... Okay, you're an investor... Okay, let's say you've got several hundred dollars. Then there is these lottery numbers. If they don't hit, you win. You in? You got any money? I believe we are done. Hey, I got two more shareholders. One of them's got to rob his parents' house real quick, but he's definitely in. That's 500 more tickets.Yup. All right. You want a bong hit real quick? I don't know what that is.- Marge? No thanks, Bill. All right. Ow! Our next number is 46... Number 24... And our very last number for today is number 23. So, one more time, those numbers are 05, 21, 39, 46, 24, 23... Okay, here we go. No more cigarette burns, huh? Yeah. Well... I guess we fire up some of that delicious motel coffee and get started. Or it could wait till morning. Tomorrow? Oh. Hmm. The lottery? Lottery winners get a lot of clicks. I don't do clicks. I do news. Do you not see all these empty cubicles? Just poke around for something. Find me a headline that I can throw in the Spotlight section. Hmm. Oh, nice thing about this mattress is, we both roll to the center. I don't think I can get out if I tried. Well, we have time. What? What the heck? Hey, hey, all right, all right. Got the wrong room. Got the wrong room. It came in! What did? The lottery sends a tally of all the winnings sold by the store. WinFall tickets won $82,000. And how many WinFall tickets did you sell at your store? Just yours, plus six more. Yes! To me. But those didn't win. We doubled it. We doubled it. We doubled it! We doubled it! We doubled it! Whoo! It's Steve. Hey, Steve. Hey, Jerry. I was just checking to see how we did. Um, you know, curious. I will be sending out an official shareholder report. Yeah, yeah, right, right, but you know... He wants to know. What do you think? Well, we doubled it. We doubled it! Shh. This can't be real. I didn't believe it either, but I've been running simulations during the drawings, and it's right. If you bet at least 10 grand, the odds tilt towards the buyer. Can you get money from your dad? I'm not asking him for shit. Why not? His name is on a building. I think he can afford it. Because this is mine. Do you have 10 grand? No. I have a dorm. Okay, that is one slice of pizza per person. One slice. Thank you. Hey, only take a piece if you contributed to the fund. The first thing you learn at Harvard is that you're here for your future. Right? Second thing you learn... Is that's all bullshit. There is no future. There is just now waiting for you to take it. I found a flaw in the lottery. Okay? A way to beat the game every time because nobody at the lottery figured out what I did. But it only works if you can bet big. So, tell your parents that you have new lab fees, or need books, or got an STD. Whatever it takes, because if we pull this off, then we are legends! Also, I'm gonna need you all to fill out about 300 lottery slips, so we don't bet duplicates. Here you go. That's for you. Thank you. You're not filling any out? No. I'm in charge. Okay, talk to me. So you wanna renovate it? Yup. All the shareholders are chipping in. We're bringing back the jazz festival. The best music is the music you make up as you go along. Ah, I'm just sad we couldn't have had it when Prince was around. He wouldn't have come, Howard. We'll never know. You guys are sure this is what you wanna do with your money? You don't wanna invest it somewhere? We are investing it somewhere. All right. I'll give you a hand. All right. Doug, put it on top there.Yup. All right. Thank you. Wow. Why do you keep all these? The IRS. When we get audited, we'll need a paper trail of all the losing tickets we bought. Think you're gonna get audited? Oh, yeah. Jesus. You know, your group hired me to fix the amphitheater. Six-month job. Oh. How about that? Yeah, how about that? Well, you may wanna consider chipping in on that. What? Well, you have a share. You did, from the start. Dad... You didn't have to do that. Oh, I didn't wanna count nickels without you. I'm telling you, Dottie has done such a great job with this bookstore. Yeah. You know, Leon is renovating the hotel. Howard got him a deal on it, but his commission is that he and Shirley get to use the hot tub whenever they want. Leon will regret that. You are not kidding. Hello, hello, everybody.- Oh, hey! All right. Well, go ahead... Go on, sit on down. Uh... Uh... Well... Look, first off, I can say that we're doing pretty darn well. Yes. Yeah. But you probably already know that by reading your shareholder report... I can't get mine to open. Oh, do you have Word? I have Windows, I think. I'll print you one, Shirley. Oh, thank you. Anyhoo... As you might have imagined it, we're gonna use the majority of our capital for betting. Yeah. But there are dividends that you can access. Right. So, I know a lot of people would like to see the jazz festival come back. And, Old Frank can sure use a mail truck he doesn't fall out of. Uh, so, now on to the profit ratios. We... Yes, Raj? Is there not food at this thing? No. No. This is a shareholder meeting. It's not a party. Then why did you have it at - 00, when we all eat? Well, you're welcome to all go to the diner, but... No, then you're not gonna learn about the numbers. So, what's the next play? 312,000 tickets. That's $600,000.- Yeah. We're betting half a million in one play? Oh, the money is the easy part. Is it? Yeah. It'll take four days of betting, two machines, 12 hours a day. Then why don't you just bet the normal amount? Math. It's Newton's law. If you push against something, it's gonna push back. And we discovered a flaw. But by using it, we've introduced a variable that changes it. And we don't know how long this game is gonna last. Then we need to make as much money as we can, while we can. Get the festival going, and finish rebuilding before it pushes back. Mmm-hmm. I ordered a second machine from the lottery, but they said you're only allowed one per location, so I was like, "Well, what if I have a second store?" They're like, "What's the address?" I was like, "Uh-oh. There's my mistake." And that's where my buddy, Darryl, comes in. And, uh, we're gonna give him an extra share, but here you are. You can print out 24 hours a day, plus unlimited pie. Look at this. What's this? From my source at the AG's office. Now, the lottery has to disclose players who claim more than 50 grand, five times a year. Sometimes the winners are fronts, you know, cashing tickets for people who owe child support, or have a warrant, but look at this guy. Wins big every three weeks. Lives in Michigan. A retired factory worker. No criminal record. He's won this much? Yeah. Who drives 10 hours every month to play the lottery in a different state? Yeah, that doesn't make any sense.Right. Loser! Did that woman just rob you? That's my wife. Wow. Well, she certainly seems spirited. Yeah, she's a spitfire. No, she's just pissed off 'cause I filed for divorce, and she didn't ever think I'd be able to afford it. Huh. Looks like money well spent.Yeah. Kind of lost the magic ever since Steely Dan stopped touring. You know... I need to find someone like you. Only younger. Yeah, that started off great. No, I mean, you know, just someone that's still fertile. And their womb can have babies. You're not good at this. Oh, I'm really not. Can you help me? Well, my mother used to say, "Kiss a few frogs, then when you find your prince, "you'll realize that the frogs are better, 'cause they make you laugh." Does laughing at you count? Bill, you need a new frog. I need a new frog. $50,000. Welcome to the now, bitches. We are going to make a shitload of money, but it's going to take time, and sweat, and passion, okay? So, everybody fill out two stacks of slips. We need to get 25,000 in in the next three weeks. Something wrong? There's another group. What? The payout should have been bigger. The only thing that makes sense is another group eating into the pot, so I checked sales at every store. That's public information? No, I hacked the state lottery. Nice. Wait. That's my laptop. Yeah. You should destroy your hard drive after this. Dude.Whatever. It worked. Look at the winnings in Sunderland, from only two locations. Two locations. They'd have to buy tickets for a week to get those kind of numbers. They're there right now. Hey. I finished early tonight. What's the rush? Oh... You didn't think I'd forget our anniversary, did you? Oh, you just got that out of the cooler. Well, yeah. But I hid it behind the Yoo-hoo this morning so that nobody would get it. Whoo! Wow. You know it's good when it does that. Beautiful plastic china. Here you go. Here's to 46 more years. Cheers. Ooh. I think I still owe you a prom night. This was easier when I was 16. You're even more beautiful now. That's the out-of-date champagne talking. Yeah, he really shouldn't be selling that. Oh. Mmm. No teacher to pull us apart. You guys are the other group? Oh, man. We thought it was gonna be, like, a crime syndicate or something. Phew. I don't know what you're talking about. Sorry, we are being super rude. I'm Tyler, this is Eric. We run a betting club at Harvard. We're called Random Industries, which is also the name of my skateboard brand. Well, I figured there'd be somebody else. Me, too, but I mean, I didn't expect this. Look at you guys. It's like Up. Would you like a glass of champagne? No, I only drink Jager and Red Bull. But thank you. Oh, well, at least you'll never have to worry about being our age. Look, we're really only hurting each other by playing at the same time, so here's a better offer. You join my group, add your capital to our pot, and we'll handle all the betting. Well, I don't know. We kind of like to do our own thing. What? You'll get a cut without having to do anything. I have an army of bettors. You won't even have to leave your rocking chairs. We're good. This is about making money. You like money, right? Well, not as much as I like other things. Oh, my God. Uh, now, look, if you two don't mind, this is our anniversary. And you are killing the ambience of our liquor store. You're welcome to take a Red Bull for the road. Or maybe a juice box. You're good at math. Yay! I'm sure that helps out on the farm, but at Harvard, we learn a little something called binomial distribution. Look it up. Then you'll see why your odds are better when you fill out your own slips. You're welcome. Binomial distribution only considers two factors. Not a third, which is human error, or a fourth, which is the time it takes for you to fill in the tickets. You gain a whooping 32 bucks for every $100,000 you win. You're welcome. Seriously? Shut up! What? I guess it wouldn't be a prom without dumb teenagers. That reminds me of where we left off. So I get the house? Yes. You get everything. Bill just wants to keep his share of GS Strategies. Whatever. I got the house. Well, good luck to you, Candace. You know, we had a few good years there before it all turned to shit. And I hope you find your frog. Uh-huh. Hey, what is GS whatever? Oh, yeah. That's a little company I'm a part of. Uh, we win the lottery every month. See you around. I'd love to re-open the ice cream shop. Well, now you can lease it for $1.19 a year. And the Downtown fund will cover the rest. $1.19?Mmm-hmm. Oh, it's a euro. It's a complicated story. Jerry can explain it to you. Boy, oh, boy. I just bought a Corvette. Yeah, I can see that. You want to take it for a ride next week? I'm going on a cruise to Me-hi-co. Oh, no, I don't think I can get into it. All right, old man, suit yourself. There's another group. No.Yep. Some kids from Harvard figured it out. Well, that sucks. We should be okay. We're still winning enough for people to rebuild and get the jazz fest going. We just have to stay in the game. And we will. Well, that's easy for you to say. You're not standing at a machine for five days straight. I said I would take a shift. No, no. That's okay. Yeah, because you guys like it, right? Yeah, we do. Yeah, you do. Yeah, you do. So glad you got the day off. Well, it doesn't feel like I did.- Oh, oh... How did you guys do this for weeks? Because it's an adventure. Oh, no, this is not an adventure. It's getting paper cuts in a motel filled with prostitutes and drug dealers. Oh. Well, Dawn, you don't have to do it. Oh, no, no, I want to. I do. I mean, I never get to spend time with you guys, and, you know... Feeling trapped in a gross hotel, filling bins with losing tickets is just a memory I will never ever forget. Oops. This one's a winner. Oh, you missed it.Okay. I'm done. I'm done. Hey, when's the part where you get to turn in all the winners? Because I will do that. Well, that is fun. We're gonna have to double check all the... Is there a bar at this motel? Mr. Grazio? Maya Jordon. Boston Globe. I had some questions about the WinFall game. Well, Melanie Hawkins handles our publicity. But the game has been a huge success for the state. Not just for the state. Are you aware there's a player in Michigan winning millions every month? We raise a lot of money for schools, but nobody does an article about that. Some retiree gets lucky and they send a Spotlight reporter? I didn't say he was a retiree. Yeah, well, you know, it's a lottery. People win. So, wouldn't call it news. I have a meeting. Thanks for your time. Morning, Leon.- Morning, Jerry. Made you a fresh pot. French roast.- Oh. Wow. You're getting fancy. Hey, Jerry. They said I'd find you here. What do you want? This won't take long. We're not joining your group. I don't want you to. I don't really need your capital anymore. I just need you out of the game. So, you're out. What? See, you're not really as good at calculating people as you are numbers. So you haven't really run the math on what somebody like me would do to win. And what would you do? Set an army of the smartest kids you've ever met against you and everyone you play with. We hacked into the state lottery to find where you were betting. You don't think that we can hack into your accounts? Your credit? Your identity? It won't be hard. I mean... Most of them think a firewall is something in their chimney, so... Why are you doing this? It's just math. Nothing personal. Look, you had a good run. You made some cash for Mayberry. But it's over. Enjoy your golden years. Hey, so how many days do you think we'll need? None. We're out of the game. Jerry! Oh... Uh... Okay. Uh. Oh, boy. Well, uh... I'm sad to report that, due to some new variables in the game... Um... We're going to have to stop playing. Um... I am sorry. So, you're really going to let some college smart ass take all this away from you? The odds that he might do something outweigh the benefits... It's not about the math. It's about being human. You know, Dad, I... I've watched you spend so much of your life just being overlooked and pushed around. Nobody knew what you could do. Nobody cared. And then you finally took your shot, and you brought us all with you. You know what you did? You made our little town feel big. That's why they're all in there. That's why I was in there. He'll be okay. You know why I don't like to fish? No. The last time that I went, I took him with me. He was 16, 17. And I started calculating how fast the bobber was moving so I can figure out the speed of the current. And then I hear him ask me, "What do you think, Dad?" And it was at that moment that I realized he was talking about a girl that he liked. And... Oh. I had no idea. You know, it's... It's never been a gift. It's been a trick. Your brain tells you that you see what other's don't, but in the end, you're just seeing less. Uh... I think I'll walk home tonight. All right, guys, it's gonna be a big one. It's all of us now, so make it count. Go, go, go. Roll down's this weekend. Mmm-hmm. I know. I'm just trying to do the right thing. Oh, you always do. I love that about you. And that's why everyone in town trusts you to take a chance. The one thing I have never seen you do is give up on a problem before you find a solution. What do you mean? Well, you've calculated Tyler's threat, and the value of the game, but binomial distribution doesn't consider the third factor. That as long as you and I have each other, we are not afraid to be stupid. You're bat shit crazy. Oh, there's Steve. We're heading to Massachusetts. Ha-ha! I see you! Go get 'em, boy! Whoa! Yeah, let's do this! Marge! Give me five. Jerry! You're a madman. Pound me. I thought it was supposed to be more without the split. Did you check for other claims? Yes. There was one. Where? Sunderland. Shit! He called your bluff, okay? There's nothing we can do but accept it. If there's a roll down, he's going to play. Unless we create the roll down. What? It takes weeks for a roll down, right? I mean, WinFall takes in 100 grand a day, and then when it hits two million, we know a roll down is coming in, and everybody starts betting, and Benjamin Button gets in his truck. But if we create a roll down when nobody expects it, we take it all. We squeeze the other players out. We use our hack to track the pot, we wait for it to hit a million before a drawing, and then we bet a million in one day. I mean, we own the game. And where do we get $1 million? As you can see by our returns, it works. And with more capital, we can control the game. Is your dad in on this? No. He... Um... Thinks you're going to college? He thinks I'm studying to be a lawyer, like him. But last time I checked, my father never made $1 million in a night. We have 14 hours to pull this off. Get to your location and don't leave until you print all your tickets. Some locations might push back on printing all day, but do not let them. They work for us. Let's ride. Yes!- Whoo! Yeah. Hey. What happens if somebody wins the jackpot and we lose $1 million? Beyond dropping out of school because I blew my entire tuition? I think one of those investors might actually kill me. Ooh. You all right?- Yeah, I got it. Oh. Okay. I got the key. What the heck? Oh. Hey! We missed it! What, someone actually hit all six numbers? No. No. It rolled down. No, that's impossible. It's only the second week. It never rolls down before three. It rolled down last night, and we missed it. The Harvard group triggered it on their own. How would they know how much to bet? The lottery doesn't post the amount... Well, they knew. Jerry? Where are you going, Jerry? Jerry! It's on the freakin' news. The lottery didn't even see it coming. This is so epic. Hey, Jerry. What, did you come ridin' in on your tractor to come give me a whoopin'? Believe me, I wanted to. Part of me still does. But then on the long drive here, well, most of that just, poof, went away. And I realized that I wasn't really angry at you. I'm disappointed. Aw, you're disappointed in me? No, not you. You're insignificant. No, I was disappointed that I let a selfish kid like you get to me. Huh. I was always good with math, but it took a long time for me to figure people out. So, tell us, Jerry, what did you figure out? That the solution isn't numbers. You told me that I was playing the lottery because I had nothing else. But the reason you won't share the pot is because you have nothing else. You think being the smartest guy in the room is all that matters. But it turns out it's this room that matters. All these bright, young people helping you get rich. How are you helping them? Guess you haven't run the math out on that, huh? Anyway... my tractor's running. I wish you all the best of luck. What? Just get back to counting. If the Harvard team can trigger a roll down, they run the game. So we trigger our own roll down. Yeah, we have enough cash. No.Why? Because it's not fair to the regular players. He's right. It's not who we are. But we're so close. I mean, downtown is back, the jazz fest is coming. If we keep winning, we could actually hire somebody to play there. You should get Steely Dan. That is an amazing idea. We should get Steely Dan. We can't win if we can't play. Well, this just sucks. The lottery isn't stopping us, but a bunch of college kids are? Huh, that's a good point. What is? I wasn't making a point. Why isn't the lottery stopping them? It's because they don't care. Oh. That could be our answer. Always happy to meet with our loyal players, Mr. and Mrs. Selbee. Oh, please. "Jerry and Marge" is fine. What can we help you with? So here's the thing. The state lottery was losing money a few years ago, and hardly anybody was winning the jackpot, so Mega Millions ate your lunch. Then along comes WinFall, and all that changes. You folks made millions, before you realized there was a flaw in the math. You probably panicked at first, because you knew that once everybody saw it, that the game would collapse. Except they didn't see it. Only me and a few kids from Harvard. Which meant that we were pushing millions into the game, and, boy, sent your profits through the roof. So, all of a sudden, your mistake became your windfall. I gave him that line. Yeah, she sure did, and it's a dandy. So, what exactly do you want? Transparency. We'd like the website to show the size of the jackpot. That prevents any group from forcing a roll down. Makes it fair for anybody who plays. And we would like two machines at the Liquor Hut in Sunderland. So we can be together. These are our golden years. We'll take care of it. Yeah, we'll be making another play soon. That's great to hear. Yeah. Talk soon. He's wants to bring in other partners from the firm. Dude, we might not ever need a real job. They posted the jackpot. What? The lottery changed the website. You can track the jackpot online. We can't roll it down anymore. Shit. Shit. All right, let's break this guy. He wants a war? We'll give him one. You want some nachos? Uh, no. Yeah, I'll try some. You know, I'm good. Where is everyone? We're supposed to be betting. Dude, it's over. Nobody wants to do it anymore. What? Why? We're winning. No. We're assholes. And that doesn't work for anybody but you. Fine. I'll do it on my own. It's gonna be insane. Crazy. I told you we should have... Did you get the pretzels?- Yeah. This just came for you. Thank you. Oh. Finally. Paycheck? Like I'd get excited about that. No. State lottery commission. They don't want to talk to me, but anybody that wins above 60,000 is in the public record. You just have to submit a request. Which I did, for every drawing in the last six months. Gerald Selbee, every three weeks. Mmm-hmm. Tyler Langford. Same drawings. There's another one. Huh. Tyler Langford. Tyler Langford. Okay, Tyler Langford, I see you. Best euro I've ever spent. Thanks, Raj.- Thank you. Okay, girl. Darn!- Whoa! Try one more time, sweetheart. Like a kangaroo. Hey, would you hand me a 10 mil? Yeah. Ten mil. Here you go. Thank you. You won't even buy yourself a new truck? Nah. This one works. Does it? Not all the time. But I think that's why I like it. Hmm. You know what? I did buy this. I counted nickels with you because it was something I understood. I didn't know a better way to spend time with you. I just knew that I wanted to. You know how it works? Well, I assume you create spin, which gives it a third axis, so that the wind can offset the gravity. Yeah, that's it. Just like that. Wanna test that theory? All right. Fingers on the laces.Yeah. Oh, well. Not bad. I'll work it out. I know you will. Oh, that's it.- Mr. Selbee? Maya Jordon. Boston Globe. I'd like to ask you some questions about GS Investment Strategies. So, you and your wife count tickets in a hotel room for 11 days? Yup. That's so much work. Mmm. It doesn't seem like work. I've worked all my life. This is different. This is very different. You send it in yet? They helped their entire town. The flaw isn't the story. Well, this can't be a puff piece. I need a headline. Ah. Well, we do well on this one, we won't need the game anymore. You know, I was thinking, if we're going to have a fund for the town, managing it, it's gonna be a full-time job. Well... Hey, you think we can get one of those offices downtown, like Steve's? What? I already got us one right next to his. You did? Yes! In fact, his Corvette is actually in one of our parking spots. Well, we'll have to take care of that. What? They're moving out the WinFall machine. Hey, hey! Hey. Hey! Hey. Bill! Bill, what happened? The lottery suspended our license. Why? You didn't see the article? Oh. Hey, buddy. How's school? Uh, Dad. What are you doing here? You're famous. Great move, genius. Let's go. Pack up your stuff. You're coming home. Now. The high-volume betting groups discovered a flaw in the game and took advantage of it, to the tune of millions of dollars. Lottery officials expressed their surprise at the discovery and announced they will phase out the game after tonight's drawing. Moving on to our next... The last roll down was today. You could've gotten your final win. Yes. But even if we found a place to bet, it wouldn't have felt the same. It was more than just a game to him. He finally got to use his gift to connect to people. Jerry! What? The shareholders are having a meeting tonight and were wondering if you could stop by. Are they upset? If I told you that, you wouldn't come. I tried to answer all their questions in the newsletter. I don't think they know how to open the newsletter. Well, they don't have to worry about anything. We didn't break any laws. Holy... It's jazz fest? What? Jerry! Marge!- Huh. Yeah! Come on! Let's do this! Yeah! Okay, right? Jer and Marge! How did you... We missed the final play. Oh, no, we did not. Yeah, everybody took a store, Dad. All across the state. We had a bus and everything. What? Oh. You didn't have to do that. You did it for us. Why wouldn't we do it for you? And don't worry, we left you two the counting part. Hey, Raj! I would help, but, uh, I can't count. Yes, you can. I can count. I just don't like to count. This town isn't just a newspaper article, Jerry. It's all of us. And you brought this town back from the dead when nobody else could, because you don't think we're just numbers.

Jerry and Marge dissolved our betting group when the WinFall game was phased out. They used most of their lottery winnings to start a construction loan business for the town of Evart.

His lottery calculation won a grand total of $27 million. Okay, let's go count. ♪ Dream a little dream of me He made how much?
