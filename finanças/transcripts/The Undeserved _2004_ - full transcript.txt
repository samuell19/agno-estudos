[♪..., projector clicking...] [young man] You ever wonder where you came from? You ever wonder who your parents are? I mean, not their blood type or their DNA, but, you know, who they really are. You ever look at your mother like she's not your mother? Look at your father until he becomes a complete stranger? You don't even recognize your own reflection in the mirror. You think you were left here by space aliens, and one day maybe you'll figure out what fuckin' planet you're really from. Welcome to Athens, Vermont. [♪..., camera clicking...] You could go your whole life without hearing this story, and I don't even know if it'll make a difference, but, I'm gonna tell it. Nobody ever told me a fuckin' thing. I got it all up in my head, and I'm gonna give it to you. [♪...] [dialing phone] - [♪...] - [indistinct voices in background...] [dialing phone] [phone ringing...] [older man] Hello? [ding] [two beeps] Hey, sweetheart. [♪...] You ever wonder where you came from? Yeah, you do. Well, this is where I came from. [Man] Any vials you don't use, put them back here. Any live specimens, put them back in the water. Okay, my problem, it's not the fact that I couldn't explain my experiment. That happens to a lot of people. You couldn't explain it to a 15-year-old, that was your problem. - Exactly. - You explained it to some stupid, punk kid from this stupid, punk town that you need to get the fuck out of... See, what am I gonna do in the interviews that are coming up? I have a handful of those coming up, and I don't even know what I'm gonna do. You need to fucking relax. It's all in here. It's all in here. I'm gonna go to Cali this summer, I'm gonna relax... You don't have any money. You're not gonna get the car. You're hardly gonna graduate. That's not happening. The question is: what's gonna happen after the summer is over for you, man? So this is Spring Rock school. This is the place where most of the shit I'm about to tell you actually went down. Now, these hippies, man, they really thought they were gonna save kids like me here, and maybe they did, but... I just fucking hated the place. - Hey, hey, hey... Hi. - Hi. How'd it go? How'd it go? Oh, I don't even know what I got. [scoffs] I'll see you later. - Okay. What happened? - No good samples. - Uh-huh. How was Vernal? - AWOL. Uh-huh, okay We'll talk at lunch. - Carlo... Carlo? - What? [Both speaking Italian] Ciao. And Charlie's going down, you know, going down to the bank to get some web samples. But he didn't take part in the whole thing? Well, no, he didn't take part in any of the samples we were doing, - he was just gone. - Uh-huh. - [Young woman] we really got to get on the research. - I know. - Are we ready to get down to business here? - Yeah. Let's get down to business here. - [teacher] So, a disappearing act, like. - [man] Right. Vernal's at it again. Okay, um, let me talk to him. - I can take care of it. - No, no, no, I got to talk to him anyway. - But you deal with it every night. - That's right. Vernal? Here it comes. Hey... Let's go. So what happened? - Nothing. - Mm-hmm. Okay, um... Could you take your glasses off, please? I would love to have this conversation at home, but you don't come home anymore, so we're gonna have to do it here, okay? I'm noticing a consistency here, Vernal, and it has to do with respect. I think you're using again. I found a bottle of Jack Daniel's under your bed. You haven't finished any of the work for your final projects. I'm talking to Alex at lunch today, and he tells me you go down to the river and you... - I did science at the river. - No, you didn't do science at the river, Vernal. You did your own thing. You didn't take part with the group. Now, we made a contract three months ago, and you are not abiding by it. So I don't know what to do anymore, Vernal, okay? I don't know how to communicate to you. [woman] Kate, Bob Ross on line one. Oh, um... Tell him I'll be there in a second. Uh, we're not done with this conversation. I need to take the phone call. - I will come right back, and then we will finish up... - Mm-hmm. - All right? okay - All right. "When bread was baked in the shrine..." Behavioral changes: environmental influence or genetic modification? Which one is it? Well... The purpose of this experiment is to see if these particular changes are due to the immediate environmental factors, um, such as... Uh, pollution, or is it a long-term genetic modification which is due to Darwin's theory of natural selection? Um, now, the way I'm doing it is by isolating local spider offspring and their webs from their parents and observe whether they create the same silk pattern as the parents in a different environment. That's lovely. Throw all that in there. That's terrific. That's a lot of good work. You guys all see the amount of investment Charlie's put into what has real potential for his mind, for his future perhaps, but what I have to ask you is - whether or not you can convince anyone else. - Um... You understand that if you can't present it in a condensed form to a bunch of people in suits, you're not gonna be able to get any value out of it, okay? So start again. Limit it. [scoffs] I'm definitely gonna miss this guy. Mr. M., let me talk to Charlie for a minute. Uh, Vernal, I got to finish this. I'll see you later, all right? All right? I'll see you later though. [♪...] [Vernal] Now, I didn't know it at the time, but that would be the last day I'd ever set foot in that school. Now I'd been hearing the same song over and over again... "Vernal's fucking up, Vernal's fucking up" but you know what they weren't hearing? They weren't hearing that the real trouble was already screaming its way up the interstate. [Man, indistinct] Wouldn't really know. Didn't want 'em underneath my driver's seat. [tool whirring...] Course, that's probably where they are. - Uh-huh. - Got that bolted down yet? Have this thing ready for the show down in Westminster. Where's Cole? Well, I haven't seen him today. Uh... Greg? Seen Cole? He said he was going fishing. Might be trying to catch fish. [♪...] [zips bag] Are you ready? Yeah. So, how did it go? All right. I'm beat though. [chuckles] No, I was talking about Charlie with his presentation. The science is fine. His presentation is all over the place. Oh. Can you help him? - Yes, I can. - Great! I was thinking, maybe Jack will speak. - Speak? - Yeah. For us. The announcement. Hey, hey, hey! Hey, guys, guys! Hi, I'll see you later, okay? Sure. Are you guys bringing the lamb? - Yeah, don't worry. I will take care of it. - Okay. See you at home. - See you later. - Bye. Gosh... I'm getting nervous. Oh, no, don't be nervous. I'm very excited though. You? Mm-hmm. - Mama? - Yes? Are we doing the suit thing today? Ah, yes, of course. We have to do the suit, uh... Before she closes, yes. We have to... One minute. [quietly] I forgot. Can you get the lamb? Yes, I can. Okay, great. See you at home. - All right. - Okay, bye. Bye. No pinstripes. [woman chuckles] So, do you like it? Yeah, it's good. - Hmm? - Uh... Ma troppo Grande, no? It's a little big? [Tailor] No, it looks good. - You look great. - All right. Oh, Tesoro, I, I have to buy some flowers for tonight, but I will be right back. - Flowers, okay. - Okay? Okay. Sei bellissimo! [both laugh] Okay. - Ciao. - Ciao. - [phone ringing] - [door opens, Bell jingles] [sighs] [door shuts] You got a call. Okay, just a minute. Excuse me one minute. [door shuts] [exhales sharply] [muffled conversation...] [door opens, bell jingles] [door shuts] You know what I'm saying? [Charlie] Hey! Vernal! - Hey. - Hey, man! - Carlito. - What's up? Sorry, I couldn't catch you today. Been busy with the experiment and all, you know what I mean. - Yeah, don't worry about it, man, it's all right. - Cool. Thought you was a cop or something, dog. - No, I'm not a cop. - No, that's not a cop. That's Charlie, man. That's me: Charlie. Dressed up like a waiter though. Yeah, man, I'm getting some tailoring over there. Listen, I just wanted to know if you were going to the dinner tonight... people have been asking about you. Yeah, um... I'm not gonna make it, but, uh... No. I am playing Rick's later. At Rick's? All right, I'll catch you there then. Great! Great. I see you there. Yeah, you go, you go to that school down there? I know you. Psshh... You went out with my brother's old girlfriend there. Oh, Joy Gilchrist. I remember that bitch. - Don't call her a bitch. - She is a bitch. [Voices overlapping] Hey, come on. Have a little respect. She's a lady, all right? Vernal, do you mind if I just talk to you for a few minutes? I'm gonna pass this blunt, but you can catch me at the trailer later if you want. I'm gonna be playing a little bit before Rick's. You sure you don't want to just talk to me for a few minutes? You should just roll, man. I'm on this blunt for a minute. I'll catch you later, all right? Don't you got tables to bus? - Hey, chill out. - Fuck you... Hey, don't be coming on our block talking like that, yo. You need some respect. Yeah. Forget you guys. I'll talk to you later, man. All right, man. Sure, it would have been nice if he just walked away like that, but that's not what happened. You see, I kind of threw him to the wolves on this one. - I'll talk to you later, all right? - All right, man. - All right, man. - All right. Charlie had been going through some shit. There was a lot building up that just had to come out, and I knew that. Last year? Last year, this never would have happened. Last year... Charlie was a little scientist. Last year, Charlie wasn't fighting in the street. I got to take you back to last year, to that fucking salamander crossing. You know, that's where I introduced Charlie to Joy. [crickets chirping...] [Alex] What do you got, Caitlin? - Nice big one. - Hey, hey, hey. Very pretty. Hey, guys, keep your hands wet. [loud rock music from car...] - What the fuck is this? - [turns off engine, music stops] - What is it? - God, fuck! It's a fuckin' roadblock, that's what it Is. Stay in the car. Jared... I have a question for you. So, some scientists believe that over 50% of the species of salamanders and frogs are lost in the last 25 years? Something like that. Caitlin, do you know anything about that? Um, uh, not, [chuckles] not entirely. - Jared! - [door slams] [Alex] They're an indicator species. They're incredibly sensitive to their environment, so they go first. So in other words, salamanders are very precious. Hey! Get out of the street, please. [Alex] Hello? We'll be out in a second, but we're getting some of the salamanders to cross the road. That's great, and I'm just driving my car through the street. - Can I get by, please? - Yeah. Alex, Alex Montgomery. - I work at Spring Rock school. These are my students. - That's fine. Could you get out of the street? - Yeah, we'll be out in a minute, we're just... - Now. - Just a couple minutes. - Get back in the car! - Jared. - Get the fuck back in the car! [Alex] Hey, hey, it's okay. We're gonna get our stuff moved... - You know what? This is none of your business. - All right, let's move some... - [Woman] Calm down. - [Jared] I'm calm! Now! [Alex] Yeah, let's go, let's get the stuff up. - What the fuck are you looking at? - [Alex] Hey! Hey, hey, hey. You don't have to talk to anybody that way, all right? These are my students, all right? - [Jared] Hey! Hey! Back off! - [Woman] Alex... - [Jared] back off! - [Alex] we're going, okay? [Jared] This is me nice! [Charlie] Sweet! - [fire flares up] - Whoa! [Vernal] That is fucking science, Charlie. Check it out. - Salamander? - Yup. [Falsetto] A salamander? It's such a pretty salamander. Oh, that's great. Look at that. That's nice, man. She's beautiful too. Are we gonna eat it or what? Oh, man, it's a great night for salamander crossing. Should we put it in the water? Yeah. Oh... You get really excited about this shit. Hey, how'd you get that bottle of Jack Daniel's past Alex, anyway, huh? Dude, look at my Jacket. It's fuckin' huge. I could fit you in here. So, Vernal, um... Are you gonna do any work this time? Yeah, what do you want me to do, man? Really? All right. [woman] Vernal? Is that you? Holy shit. Who is that, Joy? Yeah, hey. Come here, man. What's going on? What are you guys doing back here? - Joy pants. - Hey. How you doing? [sniffles] what are you doing out here? You look a little dressed up to be running through the woods in the middle of the night, no? Oh, shit, Charlie, Joy. Joy, that's my friend Charlie. - Hi, Joy. - I'd give you my coat, but it's kind of acting as a liquor cabinet tonight. Charlie, give her your coat. - Hmm? - Your coat, man. - Oh, yeah. - Oh, no, it's okay. - No, no... - [Vernal] No, he's well prepared. I don't think he'll miss it. - Shut up, Vernal. - Thanks. So what's going on? What are you doing out here? - I was out with Jared. - That good? Jared's out there too? That piece of shit. Um, yeah. I don't know, there were some people in the road, and... He just sort of... Started pulling his usual shit, so I just left. That was probably... There's like a bald guy and a couple of crunchy, granola-looking, hippie motherfuckers running around? - Yeah, that's our class. - Who's Jared? Jared's Joy's asshole boyfriend - who I personally can't stand. - Not really my boyfriend. What is he doing? He's running around there right now? He just got pissed off and started yelling. I think I may have found my night. Um, why don't I go handle that situation? - Vernal. - Oh, you shouldn't... No, you shouldn't do that, Vernal. Vernal, don't start anything with him. You got the salamander thing covered. You fry a couple of those up for me, and I'll be back shortly. - [Joy] Vernal. - Okay, kids? [Charlie] please don't get into trouble, Vernal. - I'll be fine. - [Joy] Don't tell him you saw me. Don't worry about it. It's cool. [Joy] Oh, Jesus. [fire crackling...] [distant shouting...] So what are you guys doing out here? Oh, we're, um... Out on a field trip, doing some science... Experiments... So do you go to school around here? I don't go to school anymore. I, I actually, um... [clears throat] just started on this experiment, so I have a lot to go, and... - Go ahead. - No, I mean you're welcome to join me, if you'd like to, I mean... I don't really know anything about it. Oh, it's pretty easy. [Joy] is that one? [water splashes] Just keep shining it. - Ooh, oh... Oh! - [splash] Oh, that's great! [Joy laughs] Oh, that's incredible. Oh, man. Alex isn't gonna believe this one. Good eye, Joy. - [crickets chirping...] - [Jared] where the fuck is she? - Excuse me? - That girl I was with, where the fuck is she? I don't know. That way. - God damn it. That fucking girlfriend! - Big surprise. - What'd you say? - Nothing, I'm sorry, listen, I don't know where she is. - What the fuck was that supposed to mean? - Nothing. We're leaving, okay? What, is she with you? With your fucking class? - Hey, she's not up there, okay? It's all right. - Get the fuck out of my way. - Get the fuck out of my fucking way! - [woman] Stop! - Fuck off me! - Hey, hey, hey! Back up! Back up! We're going, all right? - That's right! - [Woman] Going home. [Engine revs...] Joy! Fucking lucky. Joy! [Engine revving...] [Accelerating...] [♪...] Well, that was last year. You ever wonder what your teachers do when they're not in class? Well, this year, this day, the answer to that question got really fucking interesting. Lily. It's Alex. - What? - I thought that was you. Right, it still is. Just... Surprised to see you, that's all. When did you get back? I haven't been back. You look good. Glad to see you're okay. - Do I look okay to you? - You do. You want a ride? Yeah. Can I drop you somewhere? "Drop" me? Wherever. You got a place to stay? You offering? Jack tells me you have a good job in New York. He lied. Turn in here. [turns off engine] How long you staying? I'm not sure I am. It was good seeing you. Was? Is? [chuckles] you keep mixing tenses. Yes, I am. Take care of yourself. Yeah. You wanna get a drink? Oh, uh... No, I gotta get back. Yeah. Listen, I'm sorry... I am sorry. [chuckles] That was then. Now you've got all your tenses covered. I do. Come on, one drink. A toast. [♪...] He's going to tell me tonight if he's coming. [women continue indistinctly...] - Hey, how are you? - How are you? [Kate] Do you want to come help us? We have so much to do... The star fellowship program. [clock ticking...] [women laugh nervously...] [mother laughs happily, cries] Oh my god, they are offering you a full scholarship. [mother laughing, crying] Come here, you. Come here. Good job, hmm? When it's going to be? Uh... Oh, wow, they want you there in August. That's soon. - August? - We have to find an apartment for you. We can go down to Boston next weekend. We can go meet with Dr. Goldham. We can go see the labs - and Cambridge. - Uh-huh... - Yeah, I think it will be great. - [phone rings] - Four years. - Hold on. - I'm going to miss you so much. - Yeah... What? It's just all happening so quickly. The dinner and then the letter, I mean... Hey! Guess what? Charlie got into the star fellowship program. Yes! [laughs] [Charlie speaking softly in Italian...] [mother] Okay... Okay. Did you return those phone calls from Florida? Uh-huh, 'cause they seemed urgent, okay. Okay, great. See you later, drive safe. Okay, bye. - You want to talk, maybe after dinner? - No, no... We can celebrate, the two of us, yeah? Okay? I'm... I'm sorry, Kate. I'll be right back, okay? [Mother and Charlie murmur in Italian] [door closes] [♪...] You should have seen her face when I asked her if we should get married. It was like all her questions got answered, boom! Boom boom boom boom boom boom boom. Now life can begin. Something like that. It was good. - I bet. - It was good to give somebody that kind of respect. What about you? What about your book? About my book? It's gestating. Ready to come out any time now. [Lily chuckles] [radio plays rock music softly] Thank you for this. For what? This resolution. [chuckles] Felt sad, felt sad about the way it ended between us. Why would you be sad about that? Well, I guess I feel sad about a lot of things. Makes sense then. Mmm, what does? You settling here. This is the place that sad people come to fade away and die. Okay... Alex, I know what it's like, to be a bright person in this town and to have ideas about what you want from your life and to follow a path and then have all the doors closing on you. I know that's your experience. It's not necessarily mine. You know you deserve more than this. I probably deserve this conversation. Yeah, you deserve so much more than this. I deserve this, but, um... I have lamb in the car, and... I think I should go. No, Alex. Tell me what you're feeling. I think I shouldn't have come. [chuckles] No. [song on the radio continues...] So how are we doing? We're doing good. We've got the carrot soup. We've got the sautéed mushrooms. We got the fettuccine. [tap] five minutes for the sauce. There's Jack. - The man! Hey! Hi! - Hey, bunny. - [both] Mwah! - How was it? Oh, the traffic was hell after Hartford. Hey! Hi, sweetheart! [both laugh, exchange greetings] So great! Brava! Oh... Super boy! - [laughing, kissing] - I knew it! I knew it! Oh, it's so great, so great, so great! What we got going over here? [inhales deeply] I thought we were having lamb. - [Kate] Yeah, well... - Don't ask. Alex was supposed to show up with the lamb and he's... Late. Two hours. What... have you called him? I called him many times. I called him at school. We don't know. He is probably just dissecting a rat or something. Here, I'll call him. I was so looking forward to telling about Charlie, and... Where is he? Oh, that's pretty. [Kate] Thanks. The boys coming? Charlie will be back soon. Vernal? No, no, come on. Don't tell me that. No, I guarantee you. - Why, is he still AWOL? - [Kate] Yeah. I'm not getting anything. What? [sighs, exasperated] I brought those CDs for him, up from New York. Well, Jack, it's not about bringing him things. It's about talking to him. It's about spending more time with him these days, okay? [sighs] Okay, I'm sorry. It's been a hard day. - Lucia. - Hmm? Go get ready. Okay, maybe I will. I think we got everything under control. - [Lucia] I will be back soon then. - Okay - Ciao, Jack. - [Jack] Ciao, Bella. Did you hear anything about Florida? Yes, uh... She had the baby. - [Kate gasps] - Yep, three weeks premature. - Baby's fine, mother's fine... - [Kate] shh! - [door opens] - the traffic was just unbelievable! - [Lucia] the letter. - [Kate] oh, the letter! - [Door closes] - and she's fine, the baby's fine, the Lloyds are jumping out of their skin because she hasn't signed the adoption papers. Yeah, we'll talk to her. Well, I mean, we'll talk to her. And the last call from the hospital was she has gone missing for 24 hours. She has been missing for 24 hours? I don't know. She went around the corner for a pack of cigarettes. - I don't know, she's AWOL. - No, Jack, don't joke about this. What do you mean? They don't know where she is? Honey, I'm not joking. I mean, what do we expect from this girl? We got a problem. [Vernal] I never got a diploma here. I couldn't remember two things that I learned at this place, but Lucia once told me there's this expression in Italy: are you thinking with your head? Or are you thinking with your ass? Because at Spring Rock, they thought it was all about the head and that's where all the trouble started. But maybe I did learn something. I mean, maybe my smart ass ain't so fucking dumb. My head's never gotten me anything but trouble, and if I ever start a school, I'm gonna call it "The Vernal Wayne Hapgood School for Ass." A lot of the work we do here is project-based. This is my room. "Project-based" is really our description for going out, out into the community, doing stuff. The whole project that will take up time outside the classroom, bring the results back into the classroom, that kind of thing. That's Reese. He's a project. I don't know if it's successful or not. We do a lot of work using the field, using the rivers, the community, 'cause we think that the school is a reflection of the community. This was all done outside of class and then brought in for people to look at. You like science? - [Joy] Mm-hmm. - Good. I'll show you some other stuff. Parent garden, a sort of parent initiative, but anyone can work it. If you have a Green thumb, you can work it. Guardians can work here, it doesn't matter. Nice to meet you. Look forward to seeing you, Joy. Pleasure. - [Lily] Nice to meet you. - [Vernal] Now, that wasn't a goodbye handshake. I think they started hooking up, like, that night. [Joy] I don't know why nobody else ever comes up here. but Charlie and Joy... - [Joy] My house is over that hill. - they took a little more time. [Charlie] So Vernal tells me you live with your aunt and uncle. [Joy] Yeah, I moved in when I was nine, when my mom died. [♪...] There's a bullet hole in the second-floor window. I never go up there. [♪...] It's still got all the same old furniture. Really? Is it all right if we check it out? - Oh, you can't get in this way. - Oh. [♪...] So I don't get it, Joy. How did you come across this place? I used to run away a lot. One night I just found it. Run away from what? [♪...] [birds chirp...] What are you doing this summer? I have to go back to school. Oh, you're doing the summer program? I have to catch up. I'm gonna be there too. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. Actually, I was thinking... You know, after that night at the pond, maybe we should work on an experiment together or something. - Cool. - Yeah? It would be great. Good project. - I have an idea for something. - You do? You want to see it? Yeah. - Come on. - Okay. [♪...] [laughing] Come on. - Got it? - Yeah. Just watch out for your backpack. [music fades...] What's all this? This is it. It's... It's a spider web collection. Spider webs! [exhales sharply, impressed] Wow, you did all this? You mind? Just... make sure you hold it from the sides... 'Cause... It's just stuck on there. Yeah. Um, they're really fragile. So, Joy... Why webs? I don't know, they're... They're so beautiful and... Well, they just disappear, so... I try to save some of them. Mind showing me how you get these done? No. Well... First, you have to find a web. [loud rock music plays...] [Flashlight bangs on window] [young woman] Ooh! [laughs] Shit... Oh... Okay, club Vernalis is now open, all right, but don't use the toilet because there's shit in there from, like, 1972. - [All laugh] - I.D.'s! Need to see I.D.'s. Show me your I.D.'s., I.D.'s. [Indistinct] There you go. I.D.s... Oh, it's ladies night. Ladies drink free tonight. [Joy] Think they saw us? [Charlie] Who cares? Sorry about Vernal, he's so crazy. [Joy] Yeah, I know. [lighter clicks] [Charlie] So, you having a good time? I like having people up here. Um, I don't know if you remember, but, um, three months ago tonight, we met for the first time at the pond. And, um... Well, when I first came to this town, um, I was a couple of grades behind and you know, socially, I was completely lost and, as much as Vernal helped, I really never felt like I was a part of this place. You changed that for me. Yeah, so that's... [vehicle approaching...] [Charlie] what's going on? [Joy] Oh, my god... Oh, fuck. [Engine roaring...] Just stay here. - Joy, what's going on? - Charlie, stay here! Joy, where are you going? If you're not safe, then... It's my uncle, okay? Just let me handle it! [engine roaring...] [engine turns off] [loud hip-hop music plays...] Joy, my niece... where is she? - Who are you? - [Louder] Joy, where is she? Do you know Joy? - No! - Where is she? Fuck, you don't know anything. You don't know fucking dick, do you? Take it easy, man. Dumb pieces of shit. Hey, Cole. What's happening, man? I didn't think you were gonna make it... Where is Joy? - That's a great question. - Joy? That's not her, that's not her. Where's Joy, Vernal? Where the fuck is she? [♪...] Where is she, Vernal? Where the fuck is she?! [Vernal punches him] Aagh! Oh, you wanna play that little fucking dance, eh? [Joy] Cole! Let's get the fuck out of here. [hip hop music continues...] [Vernal] Cole! Cole, man, where you going? The party's not over yet! - [Joy] Vernal, shut up! - [Vernal] Still got some cold beer for you, man... oh, wait... wait, wait, wait, wait, I forgot, I forgot! You're a tweaker motherfucker! That's right! You like speed, Cole! We got plenty of that up here too, man. Why don't you get your ass back up here? We'll go again! Bitch! - [Truck engine starts] - Go one more time! One more time, Cole! I'll stab you with a dirty rig! You prick! Come try that shit again! [Shouting incoherently] [Cole's truck drives away] You okay? What just happened here? That's her ride, man. What? [traffic passing, birds chirping...] [♪...] [softly] Lil, I, I gotta go. Go. [sighs deeply] [shutter clicks] - What was that? - The way I'll remember you. I got this email from my sister yesterday. Joy? From Costa Rica? Florida. She's been there about a month. She okay? I think she might be coming back here. Oh, I didn't know. About that photo... Can I have it? [chuckles] Sure. I'll send a copy to your new house. No, I... I mean it. Oh shit, I gotta go. Don't you think you should shower? Yeah. Can I have the film? Oh... Okay. I'll be right out. [shower running, then turns off] [keys jangle, car starts] Hey, Lily, where you going? I'm taking your car. Hey, Lily, where you going? What are you doing? Hey, Lily! Lily! Lily! Where's she going? Excuse me, you didn't hear me? Where's she going? You're that science teacher, aren't you? [gasps] Oh! Ooh, I feel so sorry for you. When my husband Cole finds out about this, you know... Her uncle? When he finds out about this, boy, and he's gonna find out about it... He's gonna hurt you. He's gonna hurt you real bad. Fuck-up. [guitar playing...] ♪ Well, there's one kind favor I ask of you ♪ ♪ One kind favor I ♪ ask of you is you see that my grave is kept clean. ♪ Thank you, Athens. You playing that one at Rick's? Yeah. You know, you've been playing that song since I first met you four years ago. It hasn't changed. It hasn't changed? No. Everything changes, Charlie. Everything is gone forever every time. Vernal, why don't you cut the poetry and tell me what you mean? That's me, man. I... Can't fuck the poetry. That's... All right, then who am I? You're somebody who wants to know the answer to that question. I don't think you know who I am, man. I don't think I do either, Charlie. You can have your fucking emotions, man. I don't think that's a choice. [sniffles] Drink this. Come on, you'll go on a little vacation. Drink this. Drink it, man. You sure? Take a little vacation from Charlie. - [groans] - Feel it? Mm-hmm. [groans] [music playing softly...] That is what the fuck I'm talking about, man. You find yourself out there in the shit. In the shit. Then you hear fucking stars screaming in the fucking night, man, and you are fucking all alone, man. With the stars, man. With the stars. Life and death, man, it's two sides of one fucking coin, dude. - Life and death. - [Lily] Hey, boys. [Vernal laughs] Oh, shit. [laughter distorts] Look who's back. [laughs] I'm crashing. You're damn right you're crashing, man. You okay? I'm sorry. You just look like a... A friend of mine. Like my sister? You're... You're Lily? - That is Lily. Darling. - In the flesh. Come, come, come, come, come. Please, sit down. Have a seat. So, fuckin' Lily... So, uh, how is your sister... Joy? I'd thought you'd know. Everybody knows where Joy is, man. Joy's in Costa Rica. Turtle watch. Yeah, that's what I thought too. - Watching turtles. - What do you mean? She's, um, not there anymore, actually. Where is she now? - Florida. - Florida? Yeah, apparently she's been there about a month. Yeah, I'd leave too, man. You watch enough turtles for enough time, man, that shit could literally bore the fuckin' crap out of you. Vernal, shut up. Wait a minute, why is she in Florida? I mean, why would she go to Florida? Why would she leave the... I'd go to Florida too, man. Fuckin' fun in the sun. Walt Disney world. I hope she's okay. - I hope so. - Everybody hopes everybody's okay. We're a bunch of concerned fuckin' citizens. Can I just... Oh... - Thanks. - You going somewhere? Yeah, I just realized I have to get going to this dinner. I'm sorry, I'm a little late. Are you coming, Vernal, tonight? Dude, look at me. [laughs] I'm not going anywhere. Well, all right, they've been asking about you, but I'll just... Well, you know, kiss Lucia for me and tell Jack to go fuck himself. Uh, Lily, it was great to meet you. - Bye. - [Lily] Bye. Bye, Vernal. [Vernal] Lily was my first French kiss... age nine. I knew where Joy was. The father could have been two people. One was Charlie, and the other, nobody wanted to think about. Was I lying to them? Is it a lie if you don't even know what you know? The year before, Lily anticipated all this, and I think she was trying to do something about it, and there were always three women in Cole Hunler's life, and that house was fuckin' haunted, in dire need of an exorcism. Well, I know a little something about ghosts. How do you kill one when it's your own flesh and blood? Hey, squirt. Hey. They were missing you at school. You okay? What's going on? I'm not going there anymore. Really. Is Cathy home? She's laying down. Cathy? [Woman chuckles] "Aunt Cathy," please. What? Morning, Aunt Cathy. - Hey. - I just came to pick up Joy for school. - No. - Why not? She's only been there, what's it, a few months? Yeah, she's been going every day. And she's already gotten into a whole lot of trouble. Yeah, but she's been going to school. What do you mean, trouble? You didn't tell her about Orchard Hill? You didn't hear about Orchard Hill. Oh, you mean about Cole coming up and terrorizing the kids? You think she should have been there? What was he doing there? How did he even know she was there? Thank god somebody told him. Well, did you know that the parents are having meetings at the school about it? I think they'd probably be interested to know this isn't new behavior for Cole. He needs to be stopped. Hey, I want you to stop for just one minute, and I want you to think about what you're doing. Just stop for one minute and think about it. There are no other schools. She's been to five schools. Don't you get it? This is her last chance. So what do you want to do? Huh? I want to go. Okay. Go back to school. Okay? Go on. Go get your books. Can she stay with you? [approaching footsteps] You know what I think? I think that you should go stay with Lily for a couple of days. You guys haven't seen each other in a long time. And when Cole comes back, well, I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna figure it out. I'll fix it, okay? I'll fix it. I promise. Come on, squirt. [car starts] [car pulls away] [♪...] Don't you ever get tired of just being scared all the time? I guess. I never really thought about it. [bird cawing] [♪...] All right, stop. Stop for a sec. What's wrong? Lily? Hey. Oh, my god. What's up? I have to... Talk to you. Kind of in the middle of something right now. It's really important. Can you please come back? - No. - You need to come back! I can't. Alex, don't go. Please don't go. Please. Lily. Joy, come back later. Lily, talk to your sister. My sister is leaving now. - I'm not leaving! - Later, Joy! He's the one that should be leaving! It's okay, Joy, you can stay. I just got to go. I got to go. Alex. What? What's so important? I have to tell you something. I'm listening. You can't be mad. Joy, I can't fix everything in your life. I'm not your fucking mother, okay? Fine. [door opens, shuts] [sighs] [♪...] [applies brake] You wonder who your mother is. Not her blood type or her DNA or her eye color, but... Who she really is. I don't know if I was dyslexic or what, but all my life I'd misread that sign. "The Kennedy Home for the Undeserved." We'd come there to take a life, and I don't know how I could have driven up there and not realized that that was the last place I'd seen my mother alive. It's not my favorite parking lot. [shifts into park] Sit tight. Vernal, stay in the car. Someone's gonna come for you. Just stay here. Someone'll come. What happened? - Joy, what happened? - I want to go. You okay? What happened? Do you want to call Charlie? We can still call Charlie. [sobbing quietly] So... What's going on then? I can't do it. - You sure? - I can't do it. - Let's sit for a minute... - No, I can't. I want to go. I can't do it. Um, Kate? Hi. You're still here. Can I talk to you for a minute? Yeah, sure. Come on in. [typing] ♪ In the night, where the light glows on ♪ ♪ I'm broke and in the dark, another... ♪ Hey, Vern. How you doing, man? Good to see you. Gonna play tonight? - Yeah. - All right! I can play guitar? Yeah, that's cool. Look, um, you know those friends of mine I told you about from New York? - Mm... - That tape you gave me, I sent it to them. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - They're here tonight. Okay. Yeah. It's good, it's good. Okay, yeah. Um... I don't know, I'm gonna take a piss. - All right. - I'll be back. - Cool. - Thanks, dude. I don't know who else to call. Well, who you gonna call, honey? - I don't know. I mean, I called everybody. - Oh, gee. [Kate] Don't worry. Both my men are not here. Let's give 'em another 15 minutes, and then we'll start to worry. They're probably gonna both show up being hungry... - Hey! - Hey! So sorry. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Oh, hi, sweetheart. I am so sorry. - What happened? - Ugh! I just walked for about 45 minutes. I lost the car. - What? - I just lost the car. I came out of the co-op, and it wasn't there. I stood in the space as if, - as if it was gonna... - Why you didn't call me? Because I was going after the car. I thought I saw it across the street. But two hours and you didn't call me. - I know but I had to walk here. I don't think anybody stole it, - Somebody stole your car? All I think is that I saw it across the street after it was out of my space, so I said, somebody has gotten in my car and driven across the way, so I thought it's not stolen but somebody... Do you remember that article about the Ford? Where the guy had the Ford and he had the wrong Ford for about a week before he realized with the cigarette smoke and everything? I think that's what happened here. I think somebody has the key. I think somebody has a key that works in two cars. - Did you call the police? - No, I'm not gonna call. No, I don't think so. - I don't think we should call the police. - Did you get it back? No, it will be back though. I think it'll come back. Carlo got the full scholarship! I almost forgot about it. What now? He got the scholar...? Oh, my god! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Oh, when did you find out? Hey! Oh, god. That is great. Hey, I should change. I'm gonna change. Hey! You look beautiful. Finally. [laughter] 10 minutes, bud, okay? Go with him. We'll take care of everything. - [Lucia] Yeah. - Oh, my god. What was that about? I don't know. [turns off water] You ever, like, look at your reflection in the mirror until you couldn't even recognize yourself? - Like the last familiar face just disappeared? - [camera clicks] So I guess what I'm thinking is that if, you know, we respect what Joy... Anybody? You know, and keep Charlie out of the loop, in what, two months, she's gonna be showing. She's gonna be walking up and down the streets. - [Kate] two or three, yeah. Two or three months. We got the lunatic fringe uncle. I mean... This is an untenable situation. This is a dangerous situation. It's not good for Charlie. It's not good for her definitely. I'm just thinking that if he, if he's going to find out, then he's going to be destroyed that we kept this a secret from him, you know? I don't think it's fair for him. I think we're looking at a unique situation here. This isn't a girl from a family where we can go and sit down and talk to them about this. We're dealing with a potentially dangerous situation and a potentially violent situation for Charlie. Right now, I think we're looking for options to find a way that Joy can leave town... So we're gonna be like the Victorian community, we're gonna expel her from the town? Let's do it step by step, okay? Let's find a way to buy time. Junior year abroad. I mean, you know, is there something we can do? Is there something we can plug her into? Turtle watch. - We could send her to turtle watch. - Puerto Rico? It's an environmental studies program in Costa Rica, essentially. High school kids, sometimes college kids, they can take semesters abroad. Will they take a pregnant girl? I don't know what we have to tell them, but we can find out if there's a spot available. We're also gonna have to get her legal guardian, who's that? It's not the madman, is it? It's... The legal guardian's the aunt. Well, we got to get her to sign on, which probably means we're gonna also have to tell her that she's pregnant. - Step by step. Step by step. - Okay. Joy! Hey! - Hi. - What's up? I've been trying to get in touch with you for, like, two days now. I know, it's been really crazy. Yeah, um, they just told me you were going to Costa Rica. Yeah, I would have told you myself... But... This spot just opened up and... - I have to leave in two days, and... - [book thumps in locker] really insane. Well... Maybe we can... Spend some time together this weekend. Yeah, um, actually... I don't know. I mean, I just have so many things to do before I leave. I'd like to, I just... I... I don't think I can. Joy, what's going on? What do you mean? I mean, you're gonna leave for a long time... You don't let me know... And I mean, I want to spend some time with you this weekend before you leave... - You don't even want to do that. - No, I... I don't understand, I'm not comprehending. I thought you'd understand, I mean, this is everything we talked about. It's a great opportunity for me. [Quietly] Okay. [whispers] Take care. Take care. [♪...] [Vernal] You're gonna wonder who your parents are. You're gonna wonder how they looked at each other. [♪...] [Joy on laptop] Hey, Charlie! Uh, it's me... Um, I've never used one of these before. I think it's working, but I hope you can see me. Um, sorry it's taken me so long to get this to you, but it's been really crazy since we got here. All right, our next performer tonight, he's a local boy, Vernal Wayne Hapgood! [applause] [strums guitar] This is the oldest song I know. [♪...] [Joy] I was hoping to get a video of these guys having sex, 'cause they were a minute ago, but they stopped. Anyway... ♪ There's one kind favor I ask of you ♪ ♪ There's one kind favor I ask of you... ♪ Things are okay here. Um... It's hard though, now that I'm staying for another semester, the first class is leaving, so there's a whole new group coming. I don't know, it just... It takes me longer to get to know these people. I just feel like I'd rather hang out with the turtles all day, you know? They're so cool. It's like with these turtles. Like, before I knew how, how there used to be so many and now we've basically killed them off.

He always calls me, he always lets me know where he is, you know? He loves me. - Hey, Dillon. - Oh, hey. - This is Vernal. - Hey, man, how ya doin'? - Good to meet you. - Nice to meet you too. - Michael. - How are you, man? How do you say... "Vernal"? Vernal, yeah. [Dillon] cool. Uh... That was good. Yeah, I love, I love that towards the end of the song, you kind of got quiet and then there was sort of this buildup. - Thank you, man. - [Jared laughs] What's, um... It's a Blind Willy...? Blind Lemon Jefferson. [Tearfully] Well, he left a message on the phone machine at 6:30 in the morning, but I didn't get it till I woke up, 'cause you know, I just drank all night, was waiting for him. So, the message said... it was this weird area code, 4-0-4, and 4-0-4 is Georgia. So I called the number in Georgia, and it's a gas station. I don't know. Aw... Oh boy, I need this. Oh! [chuckling] Could have used a little more sugar. [laughing] - Okay, I'm gonna go. [kiss] - Okay. [Lily] How you doin'? Why do you care how I'm doing? That was a good stunt you pulled in the parking lot this afternoon. Yeah, I was in the middle of something. [scoffs] Yeah, I could see that part. I know where Cole's going. What? I know where he's going. Oh, you do... Yeah... You know everything. Lily knows everything. What do you want? I think we should talk about Joy. [Scoffs] I don't want to talk about Joy, especially with you. Joy is fine. Just leave Joy out of it. You're such a fucking troublemaker! - Thanks for the drink. - Mmm, you're so welcome. [Dillon] you think maybe... I don't know, you could get us a tape or something in the next three weeks or so? - Yeah, yeah. - Like, do you have something else you could send us? - Sure, sure, sure. - Mostly, mostly originals. And a couple covers? I mean... Yeah, but like, I don't know, like, 10 songs? Yeah, I could send you... Are you gonna stay here? Or like, a year from now... - Would you like to move out? - I wanna get the fuck outta here. I mean, taking your music and like, maybe just getting a place in, uh, maybe Boston? - New York? - [Jared] Vermin'll always be here. Like, Vernal... A year from now... Vernal? What's your next step? Like, what do you want? [Michael] where do you see yourself with where you are and what you're doing? [Jared] "I'd be right here." [Michael] See, like you... what I think Is... I really just want to play, you know? I really just wanna play. - [Jared] "I really wanna..." - You wanna shut the fuck up? Wanna make me shut the fuck up? Yeah, I wanna make you shut the fuck up! [Dillon, murmuring] We came all this way from New York... - [Michael] you know, it's just. - This shit. Look, here's the thing, okay? It's hard fucking work. The music career... Thousands of you out there with your little guitars and playing song... These guys are on the road constantly. You have to be fucking serious, you... [Michael] Right, and you can't let anything interfere with what you're doing. It's intense, it's intense shit, you really have to work at it, I mean... You don't stand a chance of making it, unless you're 100%... [Michael] Focused. You better take it easy on Vernal. Boy might snap and jump off a bridge. [Dillon] We can only push so far, Vernal. [Jared] Vernal, Vernal, Vernal. [Vernal] do you want to fucking die, man?! [Jukebox music gets louder] [chairs rattle] [grunting, scuffling...] Chill. [bottle thunks, rattles] [Jared] That's right, nothing. Be sure to kiss your mama for me, boy. [chuckling nervously] Hey. - [man] Alex. - Andre, how are you? Nice to see you. How's everything? - Okay. Good. - Ready for dinner? So... Please... [classical guitar music plays, general conversation...] [Jack] Charlie's ready. [Kate] Great, let's do it. Everybody, let's start. [conversations continue...] - Great to see you. How are you? - Good. [Jack] Mary, why don't you sit right there, sweetie pie? Caroline, right over here. And Don's right next to you. Guest of honor goes here... [classical guitar music, general conversation...] You're over there. Thank you. [Jack] Right down there. - Hey! - [woman] hey! [greetings and applause...] Hey, did you see that guy that Jared popped? I think he went to men's room. Thanks. Vernal? Hey. Open up, man. [Vernal] it's open. [sniffling] You sounded great out there. [Vernal sniffles, exhales] [snorts deeply] - Come on, let's get out of here. - No, I want to stay. [crying] Let me take you home. I don't wanna go home. Vernal, why is Joy in Florida? [sniffles, breathes heavily] What did you do? [sobs] Come on, it's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay. [Murmuring soothingly] Let's go, come on. [general conversation] - [tapping on a wine glass...] - Got some news. Uh, I have been wearing out my knees, beseeching, begging, pleading with Elgin Dow in New York, and he finally came through today with a check for $125,000... - [applause, shouts of glee] - [woman] Yes! Oh my god! [Jack] For orchard Hill. [crickets chirping...] [knocking] So, there we have the general topographical of Orchard Hill... [knocking...] [Jack] And, uh... - Um, was that somebody? - [Kate] Yes, I'm gonna go look. Oh, okay... Um, okay, so here's the inside. These are the revisions and I think that... [conversation continues] Hello? Mrs. Hunler? - Hi. - Hi. What can I do for you? Um, can you help me? Sure, what's going on? I need to talk to Joy. - Did Joy call you? - No, but I need to tell her something, so... And you know, I don't have her number. You have it, right? - I have a phone number. - Great. Here are the seminar alcoves. And now, um, what he's put in, which I think is really kind of neat... Should we... Toast? Oh yes, the champagne. In the bag, the bag I brought. Great, thanks, Lucia. Now, Rick Gordon the contractor tells me he is ready to begin renovation at the end of June, so if all goes well, Spring Rock could have its new campus by the end of next year. And... Let me show you this. The dairy barn on the north side of the property isn't as bad as we first thought. The foundations are fine, and three of the outer walls are structurally sound... - [Lucia] um, Alex? - So, conceivably, we could - raise the roof line... - Alex? [Jack] and create a three-story, 4,000-square-foot building. [continues indistinctly...] - [Alex] That's the bourbon. - What's this? - We're gonna toast with bourbon? - And this? Why do we have this bag? Where's the...? [Trembling voice] I'm asking you, this is your, the bag you brought. I know... with the lamb and the red wine... why is...? I don't know, you tell me. Well, let's... Let's... So you lost the car and you lost the bag now? We'll toast with champagne. Yes, but... Whose is...? I don't know, I must have switched bags at the co-op. Maybe we should develop them, so we can find out... Another time, now come... - What? - Here, hold these. I just asking a question. Yeah, I just don't know what that is. - I don't know, you brought it in. - And they're waiting. - [Kate] Okay. - Could I use your phone? Um... What's going on? Cole's in Florida. Um... okay, um... - Hold on for a second. - Okay. Hey bunny, we were going to have that toast. Uh, Jack, uh, do you remember Mrs. Hunler? - Yeah, sure. - Joy's aunt. - [Cathy] Hey. - Mrs. Hunler, hi, it's Jack Boorman. - Yeah, hi. - [Jack] How are you? What's going on? - I'm not so good. - What's up? Cole's down in Florida, Jack. Um... Your husband? He's down in Florida? Why is he down there? - Joy's there. - How does he know about Joy? I don't know. I swear, I didn't say anything. I went to Jameson's and Dave said that he's not on a run and he's in Florida. - Okay, is there any way to reach him? Um... - [Jack exhales heavily] So if we could, if we could call Joy, that would be so good. okay? Joy's not there, Joy's not at the hospital. What do you mean? Where is she? I got a call three hours ago. She's been gone for 24 hours. Now, I don't know where she is. - What? - They don't know where she is. I called the police down there. - What? - They're not gonna do anything. Wait, she's been gone for 24 hours and you knew this for three hours and you didn't call me? I would have called you, Mrs. Hunler... we've had a whole bunch of stuff going on tonight... Cathy, we weren't clear about the information yet. - Hey, do you know where Lily is? - I'm sorry? - Do you know where Lily is? - No, I'm sorry... Lily? - You know, Lily. - No, I'm sorry, I don't know where... Yeah, didn't she bring... she didn't bring your car back. - No, I lost my car today at the co-op. - No, no, no, you - didn't lose your car at the co-op! - Yeah! My car... The White wagon, that's your car, right? Yeah, but I lost that at the co-op... And she didn't bring it back to you. No, I lost my car at the co-op today... Lily took your... no, you lost it at the motel! What is she talking about? Cathy, what has this got to do with Joy? I saw him today at the motel and maybe he knows where Lily is. - [Alex] I don't know! I haven't seen Lily! - Lily May know where Joy Is! Sorry, I just don't know... Who are you? - [Lucia] Who are you? - Who are you? - Excuse me! - Let's, let's... I'm Lucia, his fiancée. He's fucking my niece! - Excuse me? - All right, whoa. - Excuse me? - [Jack] Okay, let's not go there. - Cathy, let's... - What the hell are you... Jack, let's deal with this. Can you please take this off the porch? I don't know! Fuck! I'm sorry, listen, I don't know... If what you're telling me is right, then you're worried about what's gonna happen to Joy. Make the phone call... let's call the hospital right now. No, let's not call the hospital, let's call the police. - Tell me it's not true. - It's not true, I don't know even what she's... - convince me. - It's not true, it's not true. I don't know what she's talking about. Lucia, I don't know what she... Hey, Lucia! Lucia! Lucia, listen to me! [Cathy] Please don't call the police. What's gonna happen to your niece? I don't know, but if we could just do it without calling the police. Is she gonna be in jeopardy? That's what I'm asking you. Is she in danger, Cathy? - Yes... Yes. - All right then, let's do it. [♪...] [Vernal] What? [Lily] Nothing. What, you wanna tell me something? Can you stop the fucking car, Lily? You gonna be sick? Stop the fucking car, please. Just open the window. If I open the window, the car's still moving. If I open the fucking window, the car is still moving. You're gonna be fine, Vernal. Lily, stop the fucking car. You want me to just... [opening door] get out? Why don't I just get out? Vernal, shut the door. Can we stop? Shut the door, Vernal, okay, okay, all right. You need to stop the car and I'm gonna get the fuck out. [♪...] - [Vernal] Got a cigarette? - [Man] What? - Got a cigarette? - No. [♪...] [clock ticking...] [door opens] Well, they're not there. I guess they're still out walking around. I left a note on the kitchen table for Lucia. If she wants to talk, I'll leave the door open. And I called, uh, Cathy Hunler, she's in her hotel room... With her magnum of ripple or whatever she's drinking. My god! What a fucking night. [♪...] [Vehicle approaching, tires squealing, engine racing...] Why don't you go to sleep, sweetheart? I'll finish up here. Charlie? Jack. Jack. Just what the hell is it with you people, huh? [quietly] Charlie. What are you doing here, Mr. Hunler? I thought you were gonna protect Joy! Is Joy with you, Mr. Hunler? Yes, she is with me. She's no longer with you, I can tell you that. What the hell did you do? [Stammers] she's a mess. I'd like to talk to Joy, Mr. Hunler. No, no, no, no. You're not gonna talk to her at all. You've done enough talking to her. - Is she all right? - She is fine. She is fine now. Just stay away from her. Stay away from us. All right? That's the last time I'm telling you. [Jack] Oh, fuck! Charlie. Why don't you go see if Charlie's up there. Damn it. Joy? Joy? Joy? Joy, god damn it! [indistinct] [♪...] [truck door slams] [engine starts] [Charlie] You okay? Yeah. Maybe I should call Cathy. Cathy? He didn't hurt you, did he? - Did he hurt you? - No. Were you in a hospital? Yeah. Joy, what's going on? I'm... It's fine. Hey, listen, it's fine. I'll do whatever you need me to do. Do you want to go someplace? Where do you want to go? Let's go downtown. We can go to Lily's old place. [♪...] [train passing...] [train horn wailing...] [♪...] [train sounds continue...] [sirens wailing...] [cocks gun] Both hands, Vernal. Hold 'em off. [clears throat] New Hampshire cops. None of these guys are gonna shoot you, all right? Just, uh, both hands. Give me two minutes. Just wait for me at the dam and I'll follow you. You're not going with me, Vernal. You're not here because of me. I didn't even want to have you. Your old lady fucked around and she paid for it, and now I'm paying for her. If you follow me, it's your funeral. That's the only blessing I got for you. [sirens continue...] [dog barking in distance...] Sit down. I missed you. I missed you too. So, talk to me. Um... You know when I left... Um... You said you thought there was something I wasn't saying. Well... I... I wanted to tell you. Um, I thought it was... I thought it was better if you didn't know, and then I thought maybe I could figure it out, and... It's all right. What is it? Charlie... I had a baby. [sobbing gently] Why didn't you tell me? I don't understand. I couldn't. What do you mean? I had a right to know. I could have helped you. - No. - I'm as much a part of this as you are, right? - No. - What do you mean, no? I am the father, right? Right? What... What, are you not sure? I mean, is there somebody else? [mutters] Jeez, I mean, it makes so much sense. I mean, the way you left and, you know, your sister showed up today. - And you just strung me out. - I didn't. - Who knew about this? - What? I mean, you had help getting to Costa Rica. Kate? Alex? My mama? Did they know about this? It was my choice. - Why? - I had to do it on my own. How could you do that? Had the people closest to me lie to me for seven months, and you just let them go along with it? It was me. I can't believe you did this to me. Oh, my god. Did you know about this? Vernal didn't do anything. I was just trying to protect you. [kicks, metal clangs] Charlie... Everybody was just trying to protect you, Charlie. They were trying to lift you up out of the bullshit. [Lily] I wish I'd known. [engine racing...] [engine idling...] [cuts engine, applies brake] [Joy sniffles] Where is he? I, I don't know. He's going to jail for this. - For what? - He kidnapped you. No, Lily... I called him. The baby came and I... I was scared. Laying there just... Thinking about everyone, and... - [phone ringing...] - I didn't have anyone to talk to. I just wanted to talk to somebody. - Hello? - Cole? I didn't think he could actually find me. I know it was stupid. Hey, sweetheart. Cole. I'm so glad you called. We can go anywhere. Canada, Mexico. We'll take the kid. Whatever you want. I can't go with you. You've got to go back. I'm not leaving you. Ever. [Joy] Then the whole way back I kept thinking, "I can get out of this, I can fix this." But then I realized that I had to come here. - Joy. - Not now, Vernal. Everything is actually okay. All this shit that we're afraid of, it's, it's an illusion. It's obstacles that we're putting in front of ourselves to punish ourselves. I know where you're at. I was that baby. Your baby is alive, and that's a fucking miracle. We're alive with your baby. The opportunity to give love to a life is... Come on. She's not going with you. I'm taking her home. You can't have her. Lily... Let go. Joy? [cocks shotgun] Is this the one? No. He's nobody. Let's go. [thump] [Cole groaning...] [Lily] Vernal, go get the cops. [Cole] Yeah. Tell 'em you just committed another felony assault. [groaning...] - You done? - No! Lily, stop it! I wasn't enough? You had to fuck up her life too? Did you tell her it would be good for her? Did you tell her it wasn't gonna hurt? What happened between you and I was a mistake. It was a mistake. So I let you go. I let you go, Lily. You're not gonna change anything, Lily. You can't change anything. Lily... Just... Listen! It never happened. Not with me. I love her. She loves me. You sick fuck, shut your mouth. Charlie. Tell them. - Joy, tell them. - Be quiet, Cole. Who's gonna take care of the kid? Who's there for you? Who's always there for you, Joy? - Stop it! - Come home with me, Joy, with the kid. Come on. - No. - Yes. I don't need you. - You belong to me, Joy. - No! Yes! I don't love you, Cole. You have to let me go. Charlie... Charlie, look at me. It's just us. Listen to her, Charlie. Please. [drops shotgun] [moans, sobs] [Joy sobs...] [Charlie] I'm so sorry. [Joy] Let's get out of here. [camera clicking...] [Vernal] now, I'm sure you're gonna hear some stories, but here's what I know. At first, the police found the cause of death to be undetermined. Cathy, Cathy, you can't, you can't come over here, okay, Cathy? T hen, like a few weeks ago, - they finally ruled it a suicide. - [Cathy shouting] now, of course they pulled my ass in like three or four times for questioning. Now, you know, usually that's a given, but I knew there was something they weren't sure of. Something wasn't sitting right with these guys. Oh, my god, Cole, don't leave me... Don't leave me... I told them what I knew. I said when we left he was fucked up but he was alive and the gun was on the floor. I told them Lily left when we did. Everybody confirmed that. But what I didn't tell them was that Lily said she was gonna follow us back to the house. I never asked her why she didn't. She told me she left early that morning. - [camera clicking...] - I got to admit, I've played it over more than a few times in my head. Whatever. I'm not like Charlie. I'm not really looking for the big patterns in the big webs. All I know is I'm gonna carry this around like all the other broken pieces in my bag. Did Cole Hunler get what he deserved? I don't know. You know, do any of us? I'm not sure the rest of the world has it any easier than you and I do, kid. I mean, we're all born from oblivion, bound for oblivion. It's like Hank Williams said, you never get out of this world alive. [♪...] You wonder who your parents are. You wonder what planet you're from. Well, you're father's name is Charlie and your mother's name is Joy. Welcome to the world. Now, who the fuck are you?
