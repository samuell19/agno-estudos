Dad? It's me, Sky. I've come to bring you home. Is that you? Jack fell down and broke his crown and Jill came tumbling after. ♪ Once upon a time ♪ ♪ Once upon a time ♪ ♪ Once upon a time is how you begin fairy tales ♪ ♪ This is a fairy tale ♪ ♪ After all ♪ Come forward. Elegant. Beautiful. You are perfect, my young one. You have chosen courage over fear. Once upon a time, in a faraway land known as The Kingdom of the Sky, there was a beloved young girl who possessed a grace that comes only from having a loving heart. However, with the sudden death of her father, the king, the heir was denied her childhood, and as fate would have it, destined to care for her adolescent brother and the kingdom all alone. As the months passed, the melancholy beauty found herself unfit to reign, and took shelter in the north tower of the castle, securing all entries and windows. Even with the persistent pleads from her handmaiden, there was no convincing the stubborn queen-to-be. Now, you're probably questioning, how did she stay nourished? By tiptoeing. Even a self-barricaded could not stand in the way between the princess and the strawberry short pies. Restless from months of hiding, she ultimately chose fear over courage, and decided to abandon her kingdom for the new life.

Please don't come find me. I will be far, far away. No longer your princess, Geneva. She was to depart the evening prior to her Coronation day, when the royal queen Tiara was to be bestowed upon the coming-of-age princess. However, impending on her plan was a mysterious beam of light which glimmered through her window. The peculiar illumination became so powerful, it shattered Geneva's window into glass splinters. Magically appearing from the brilliance was a ghastly, evil sorceress. Madame Mizrabel seized Geneva and brought her far, far away from the kingdom, her friends, and her family, to a dark, secluded windmill where nobody, not even a willing soul, would find her, just as she once desired. As the years passed, the Kingdom of Celestia fell into despair, as they grieved over their missing princess, as she lived out her remaining years in solitude with other rebellious children, for all eternity.

"A period of uncertainty and confusion" "in which a person's sense of identity becomes insecure," "due to a lack of feeling accepted," "and/or needed in helping to contribute" "to his/her society, and/or situation." I'm a misfit who felt useless. And because of that conundrum, I'm here with the rest. But, why am I here? Well, The Madame, of course. The Madame? Master Willow sets the rules. - Master Willow? - Mhm. He's the one in command. Madame Mizrabel is just... A witch? Ta-da! Oh. Yay! I love campfire stories. Well then grab some popcorn, you'll love this one. As legend has it, before "Mizrabel", she went by the name "Lohr", a mysterious but beautiful young woman who sold her soul to the spirits of the More Black Forest, in exchange for the power to work black magic. Black magic? With her wicked husband, Hektor, Mizrabel used these spells to take over Celestia's neighboring kingdom, Kevawit, turning its people against one another, all out of fear that she would be dethroned. Once the spirits realized the betrayal of using the magic for fear and greed, the spirits found her and... ...just as Lohr was about to take her last breath, Master Willow found her and offered her a second chance. But this time, Willow would make sure that her beauty would be no more, thus preventing her from being any part of the outside world, forced to be a servant to the master himself, for all time. Oh! And I forgot to mention the best part! Willow turned her husband Hektor into an Elgebrun Hawk Owl. The end! Wait. So, I'm a princess, yeah? Mhm. I am a princess? - I am a princess! - Yeah. - I am a princess! - All right, pull it in. Reel it in. Come on. And so, good morrow, to our waking souls, which watch not one another out of fear... For love, all love of other sights, controls and makes one little room and... Who are you? And how did you get in here? A new introduction may be in order. Thy Highness, meeteth Cornelis, my partner. Corny, meet Princess Geneva of Celestia, as if you needed me to tell you that. Hmm. Meanwhile, a few chambers away, looking after the cache of children Mizrabel struggled to keep her end of the bargain with Master Willow, and fought the urge to keep Celestia and the princess all to herself. It's about to storm. Marvelous! Some excitement around this joint. This windmill is as still as death! Yes. Ain't it grand? I'm coming down with a cold. I know it. That's why my... my... my... Silence, thy foul thing! But, but Madame, I can't help the sneeze. That's a biological thing... My dear, faithful Hektor, have you ever had something near claw's grasp and couldn't touch it? Do you have any idea how hard it is to wipe my beak with these things? They're not practical when needin' to reach for certain areas, if you know what I... I'm hungry, Hektor. I'm hungry for a royal heart. A beating, royal heart. A princess heart? Well certainly not that repulsive clod, Cornelis, and his bag of pelage. It's been torture having her flesh so close. But, yet so... so... so far. I just can't stand it. I want to her on my thriving dinner plate. Is that so much to ask? The only one who will be feasting from a gold plate is Master Willow. - Pardon? - Think about it. We've been at his beck an' call, holdin' this mill up for how long now? And for what? So one day he can rule Celestia? Where does that leave us? You're onto something, husband. ♪ From this valley they say you are leaving ♪ ♪ We shall miss your bright eyes and sweet smile ♪ ♪ For you take with you all of that sunshine ♪ ♪ That has brightened our pathway the while ♪ ♪ Then come sit by my side if you love me ♪ ♪ Do not hasten to bid me adieu ♪ ♪ Just remember the Red River Valley ♪ ♪ And the cowboy that's loved you so true ♪ Huh? I win. How many times do I have to tell you, Princess, never, ever confront the... The fourth wall, yes, yes, I know. Never again, I swear that... D... don't swear. No bad words. This is a family-friendly tale. Mhm. And, need I remind you that we are all being held against our will here. And without an audience, I might add. Then why aren't you two doing something about it? Hmm. Come what may. Bat incoming! Why? I did a whole song and dance and everything! She doesn't get the timing thing. At least I'm doing something, unlike you two, playing... whatever it is you're playing. It's called, "Oh, Fiddlesticks." "Oh, Fiddlesticks?" Glad to see there's no lack of optimism in this chamber. Are you not bored? Don't you two wanna get out and experience the world? Some adventure? Mhm. This is a fairy tale, after all. The world you come from must be so dull. I wouldn't say dull. It is different. Put yourself in my shoes. Yay, dress-up! Can I be Cleopatra? Can I be a knight? What, may I ask, are you doing? Well, you're obviously offended that we didn't ask you to participate in our little game, so, Princess, I'm trying to remedy the situation by playing whatever it is you want me to play. But I might add, that I do not believe that these are going to fit, and it stops at the shoes. I'm not... Can I be The Rock? I just don't understand you. Can I be a caveman? So... ...you're the knight in shining armor? No. I'm an... - Oh, no. - Yes? An Alpaca herder. There, I said it. Go ahead and laugh. An Alpaca herder? How does an Alpaca herder end up here? No. No-no, you're laughing. I won't laugh. I promise. They're so cute, and they've such infectious personalities. They just... ...don't like me. I'm not laughing. Really. - Your Majesty! - What? My name is Cassidy. Cassidy Lemon. Mom and Dad used to call me Chickpea. Nice to meet you. This is Bear Claw. No, he's nice. You're the king, right? I have, uh... I've seen better days. Me, too. Look at me. Why so blue? I was able to squeeze in between the bars of my cell. And I wanted to bring back some food for my friends. Like, some strawberry short pies or maybe some drinks or something like that. I don't know. I thought I was bringing back Bavarian Cream, but I was wrong. Wrong? Luckily, I took a sip before giving it to the others. It was one of Madame's magic spells! I do say, you're in good spirits, considering the most irregular of circumstances. Oh, yeah. I try to stay positive. You know how it is? Although, I should've known better when it started to talk to me. Drink me, Cassidy Lemon! Drink me! Friends say it only lasts a few hours. Although they also said slugs have four noses. You see that ambitious Gulliver's Travelers over there? That 12-foot tall octopus man? That 12-foot tall octopus man has something we want. I like the way you think, Kingy. I told you he'd help. Did you know giraffes have no vocal cords? She's gonna fall. She's gonna fall. Princesses never give up! Whoopsie. Oo, that looks like it hurt! Hmm? This is the way things work around here. Nothing is ever permanent, 'til it is. Let me go. Let's say you do get out of here. Then what? You'll be a princess with absolutely zero ability to reign while your father is still locked up in this mill. What, do you think Madame Mizrabel, or better yet, Master Willow's just going to let him go because Celestia's itsy-bitsy know-nothing princess wants him to? You say what? What? What was it, "itsy-bitsy"? My father. He's alive? ♪ No amount of time could be enough ♪ ♪ To share with you the love inside my heart ♪ ♪ There is not a single thing on Earth ♪ ♪ That could express the blessing that you are ♪ ♪ Just know that I'm not leaving you behind ♪ ♪ Oh, my love, this is not goodbye ♪ If I hadn't been hiding behind that wall, I could've saved him. You said that, not me. Come on, come on! But yeah, you did kinda lock yourself in a room... We're not leaving here until we find him. I'm sorry, Geneva, but this isn't your tale to rewrite. It's all in the timing, and the timing on the stage is controlled by... Willow. How did you guess? I am the Princess of Celestia, and I'm asking you to help me find the king. This is not a request. I will either find and free my father, or I will die seeking him. Faster! He means business! Wowwee! Wow. Your Majesty? Are they alive? Oh, sorry. Something isn't right. But, what is it? Like your Bavarian cream, they're cursed. But, why bananas, huh? They're to entice the children into this horrid place. Oh. "Hiccups", "sleep", and "laughter." But, what's a hoglet? It's no time to laugh. I didn't laugh. Oh, wowwee, wowwee! Let me go, pig, please! - You're not going anywhere. - Get away from her! - Sit still. - Put me down! See that shroud? He has a little present for you, little gremlin. Are you ready for something special? Can you two lovely humans stop stepping on my paws? That smell. Well don't look at me when you say it. It smells like... Zungenwurst. Tongue sausage. Indeed. Though at the moment I believe it to be coming from... a gargantuan squabby nearby. - A gargantuan squabby? - Yes. They're fierce castle dwellers. Indigenous to Celestia. They usually keep to themselves, unless, that is, they smell human blood. No! No-no! Listen. Oh, god. It may have mercy on us here if it gets caught in a giant squabby trap. I vote we leave now! - Is he scary? - Very. Oh, I've always been a good animal. I never wanted to hurt anybody! Is he hungry? He's malnourished. Please let me see. I'm a strong princess. Let me at that squabby. - No! - No, no! It's so sad. The poor thing is trapped in here. Don't be fooled by its 11-inch physique. Are you serious? How can anything be a threat that would fit in this box? Wait! You are not going to squash the squabby. Please let him squash it. Please. Oh, we tried to warn you. Princess... You-you... No-no! Don't squish me! You grubby little... That's using the ol' noggin'. It hurt. Oh. Well let's use these. Go ahead, Punch 'N Judy. But they're skeletons. With how this is going, I don't bethink we'll maketh 't five feet from our chamber! You clod. Do you wanna go back to wrangling Alpacas? - No. - With the squeals? No, stop it. - I can hear them. - Stop. No-no, stop. No! You're tormenting me. Stop it, you're being a bully! You are an evil, evil woman. See? Was that so bad? No, not at all. Madame Mizrabel. The king attempted to escape. But don't worry. We got him, and his little pet. Look how blue she is. You got into my potions, sweet little tot? Looks as if you found the Garden of Children, as well. No! No! Don't hurt him. Please spare my life. - Chain her and leave! - No. So, what are you going to do? What am I going to do?

My parents are the ones in the seats. Bat incoming! Why are we going this way? You said Mizrabel lives down here. Don't take me so literally. Yes, I heard it too, thank you very much. What's this? I don't know. I never came here before. But if I were to guess, I would say it's nothing good. I second that motion. Oh! Hello in there? Princess, are you sure you want to put your arm in there? I'm just trying to be cautious. I am Princess Geneva. Can you step into the light, little voice I hear? It's just a little girl. Gimme a hand, and a paw. Princess. We can't just leave them here. Hate to be a pessimist, but I knew as soon as I saw you yanking on these bars, something horrible is going to happen. You my mommy? Oh no, Corny! Oh, no! Use your weight and smash it against the wall! I am not your mother! Use your weight and smash it against the wall! I have a wonderful idea. - Yeah? What's that? - You help me! You want me to punch it? I never punched anything in my life! - Prince, let me handle this. - I'm so sorry! No, don't stop running, Thumpkin! Don't you stop! Don't stop! I'm trying to unravel this situation! Wow. You my mommy? Are you Princess Geneva? I am. She lives down there. Spit it out, you bumbling baboon! See the keys? Nothing to see here. It's just 15-foot monsters with 100-foot tentacles. They have to be hiding around here someplace! I don't think she's very happy that we're missing. We have to find the keys! Okay, slowly open the door. Remember, non-conspicuous. Yeah, it wasn't entirely our fault. - Yes, we-well... - Cover your mouth. One at a time! - I can't concentrate. - It must be the bananas. What my slimy simpleton of a partner is trying to say is we weren't completely in control of the... - Can you do it, Thump? - Mhm. Yeah, exactly what pig brains over here said. Who are you calling pig brain? He's the smallest. I don't want anything to happen to you, old chum. We have his back. Let me be useful, Corny. You gotta believe me. I can do it! I've been praying my whole life for this moment. My chance in the spotlight. The whole world will say, "Thumpkin, you did it. You saved the day!" You're chewing the scenery a little bit, aren't you? Don't. We'll give them a taste of their own medicine. We'll ghost it up. I need my motivation. What's my motivation, Corny? Yeah-yeah-yeah. Action! You were the Madame's butler, Otto. After returning home one stormy evening where she was unsatisfied with your schnitzel... - My schnitzel? - Your schnitzel. She decided to do you in. Now, you have returned to get revenge for your murder, and her critique of your unsatisfactory cylindrical minced and seasoned skin! Boo. That ain't gonna work. Give him a break. It was his first try. Oh, it's dark in here. I'm allergic to darkness! Try again. Boo. Whatever, we're running out of time. - Go. - All right, I got this. What do you mean you can't find her? They were all gone... How did she escape the chamber in the first place? Okay, here we go. Like I said before, Madame, it wasn't entirely our fault. Here we go. Oh. - Look guys, I got 'em! - Get over here! Dear wife, I don't remember you saying, "I take this owl to be your lawfully-wedded husband!" Hunt down that girl and bring her to me. I'm going to feast upon her heart in front of all of you! Oh, schnitzel. Uh-oh. Who goes there? Um... My name is Otto! I come back to suck your blood! I come back to suck your blood! No bad words. Boo. All right, come on, kids, come on. - Single file. Let's go. Come on. - Follow me. Come on, girls! Geneva, Cornelis and Thumpkin ran straight to the captured children, unlocked those doors, and vanished deep into the pit of the mill. Master Willow won't take this lightly, you know. The old witch didn't howl, roar, or shriek, as she knew the princess would not be leaving without finding her beloved father, the king. Princess, she will eventually come find us. That's how fairy tales work! Oh, God. Well, hello, little one. Princess, we have to move! You know how to get home? Geneva. You go straight home to your parents. Know that there's a strong girl inside. If you find the king, please tell him, Chickpea says thanks. Go home, all of you. Go home, all of you. Come on, girls, this way! Follow me, you guys. I know how to get home. No more hiccups. - Dance. - Dance? - It'll distract 'em. - How? Trust me. Yeah, show 'em what you got, Corny. This is my sword! There are many like it, but this one is mine! Where's my father, you... you... you... you witch? Come on, come on! I swear by this sword! You make one more move and it will be... It may be big and all that, but he knows how to use it. - Thank you, Princess. - You got it. Thump! Come on, buddy, wake up. - Daddy! - Silence. - Princess. - Daddy. Come forward. You betrayed my trust. The princess, she escaped. - And I just... - I gave an order. Yes, Master. You did. At your own accord, you've chosen fear over courage. Please, Lord, I was just trying to... The princess, on the other hand, has shown much valor. Princess? I am going to grant you a bargain, a moment to preserve yourself and your father. - I'll do anything. - Geneva. Sing for me. I, I... Princess. Sing! Would you be so kind as to allow me to hold my father? Master, may I please have a moment with my daughter? Please? What am I supposed to do, Daddy? How can I make you proud? If you're always in fear, you'll never know what awaits for you in your imagination. You have to be strong, a strong princess. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay to cry. Now, it's time for you to sing, and go home. You may always return when you're ready. When you need to.

We are gonna make it work. The three of us. Can I just check one thing? The four of us. And, although the precious family was longing for their beloved father, his spirit forever found ways to nurture his loves from afar. The end. I did a whole song and dance and everything. She just doesn't get the timing thing.
