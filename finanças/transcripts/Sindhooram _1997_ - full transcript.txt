[Cock-a-doodle-do] ANDHRA TALKIES [Bhagwad Gita] Whatever actions great persons perform, common people follow them. Whatever standards they set, all the world pursues. [Bomb blast] Sindhooram [Music] PM INDIRA WAS BRUTALLY ASSASINATED. "Shall we claim the ignorance of the half a century as independence," "Shall we do golden jubilee celebrations for the same?" "Shall we claim this arnarchy of human destruction as self-governance," "And salute it?" "This is the gift which was brought by cutting the birth of a peace bird " "This blood filled scarlet" "See the public who decorated you, hey sacred mother India" "Hey sacred mother India" "Shall we claim the ignorance of the half a century as independence," "Shall we do golden jubilee celebrations for the same?" "Shall we see the freedom of the people who fight constantly?" "Shall we call it self-governance?" "By dividing in the name of caste" "By creating rifts in the name of religion" "They would undermine the people by showing ridiculous differences" "And make them lose their lives" "By getting carried away in selfish pursuit of narrow-mindedness ignoring the unity and safety" "Why don't they realize the truth that the nation is burning?" "And why don't they come together despite knowing the truth?" "Why should someone fight for that kind of people?" "What do they need to achieve?" "For whom and with whom is this war and bloodshed?" "It is the sad tale of the people who forgot their responsibility of answering." "And it is definitely a stray sad tale" "Shall we claim the ignorance of the half a century as independence," "Shall we do golden jubilee celebrations for the same?" "Shall we claim this arnarchy of human destruction as self-governance," "And salute it?" Shut up. You idiot! [Snoring] [Vehicle vrooming] [Murmering] Bro, move that trunk. I need to rest my feet. Hey, tell him to speed up. Or, you take up the wheel. Bloody elections! They are giving us nightmares. They would bring no good except giving us back ache. Hey chief, if that's how you feel being on a high rank, Then, what about us? You shouldn't be worried because you are young. Do you know how we were at your age? Those days were different when compared with present days. What about you? I think these are the first elections under your service. How is the experience? There isn't much difference sir. I used to give proxy votes before joining the job. And now, I am making others do that. Speed up dude. -Who issued driving licence to you? -Hey, Subba Rao. -Yes. -I have been seeing you for a while, what's the hurry? Whom are you going to present that toy? Your wife? Shut up dude. Hell with your gags. I am blessed with a baby girl. I couldn't meet her because of this stupid election. We have a tradition of naming the baby on the 21st day; right? So, I bought this toy for that occasion. -You are blessed with a baby girl? -Yes. -You need to throw a party bro. -Sure. What would you name her? Nancharamma. -Nancharamma? What kind of a name is that? -It is a latest one. Didn't you find any better name? Nancharamma is the name of my mother. What would be a better name other than my mother's? I already knew that my mother would be born again as my daughter, sir. And she was born to just like I thought. Morever, my wife used to tell me that we would have a boy. But I told her, "That wouldn't be the case." "My mother would be reborn as our daughter." And she was born just like I said. [Music] As I didn't get much education, I would make my Nancharamma as a doctor. No matter how much it costs, I would enrol her in a best degree in medicine. You feel the name, Nancharamma amusing; right? I don't bother if you laugh. I didn't decide about this name today. I considered it before I got married that I should name my daughter as Nancharamma. And it became true. The name of my mother is Nancharamma. [Whistle] [Blast] [Music] [Stomp] 16 POLICEMEN KILLED ALONG WITH SOME CIVILIANS. WEAPONS STOLEN. [Truck door creaking] [People crying] [Camera clicking] Move aside. Come on, move it quickly. [People crying] [Camera clicking] Move aside. [People crying] -You made us orphans. Oh God! -Move aside. He named his daughter as Nancharamma with a lot of regard and love. He left us without even seeing her. [Siren] Hey, what's this early morning nuisance? -How many were dead? -10 persons sir. Do they need to do a big fuss for such a small thing? -What is your say on this? -What action are you going to take? This is injustice. Killing these many police brethren brutually is vey injustice. As an administration minister of this district, I condemn this act I am questioning those terrorists who blabber about principles, What would they call this acta as? This is a cowardly act. I am feeling very anguished by your agonized situation. What can I do to bring these dead brothers back to life? -Oh God! -Please, calm down. As our government is depriving the terrorists, They have indulged in this fradulent act due to their inabilty to counter us. My dear police brothers, there is no question of tolerance from now. Let us bury those terrorists of our state with stringent counter measures. Shoot those terrorists on sight and I am with you. Why? Is it to politicize our dead bodies by arriving in AC cars, after we get killed in the forests like dogs? Or is it that you want to ask the families of these dead cops, to live their entire life like dogs after you throw a compensation of one lakh rupees? Or is it to get your pictures on the newspapers with those captivated terrorrists, after we catch them by almost getting killed? Why do you want to cover us? -Hey, Bulli Raju -Sorry sir. We are actually not getting killed for saving people from the terrorists, But for guarding a white clothed-cheating b****s like you. Everything is a fradulent drama. We are dying because of your bloody politics. We are dying one by one. Even the people are getting a great topic to chait-chat in order pass an entire day. Bulli Raju, stop it. Stop it. -What is this? -Stop. Let him speak. Look dear, even I am deeply anguished about what had happened. If necessary, I will even talk to my dad who is at central level, and make them to file a committee to investigate on this. What committees would you file? -Bloody committees! -Shut up Bulli Raju! Don't talk. Come on, move... Move... 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97... Come on, run. Faster. Run faster, I say Oh no! See, Bulli Raju, you need to control your anger. We need to have self control. Our anger would kill the human inside us. Look, In our department, where the despicable officers helped a criminal like Charles Shobraj, Aren't sincere police officers like Vyas and Kiran Bedi hail from the very department? How can you forget that? Everyone is not bad. How can you accuse the entire system for there are rogues like Chalapathi Rao in politics? That is not fair, right? Suppose if you think what you said is right, How could democracy sustain in our country from the past 50 years, When the systems have been changing frequently in the neighbouring countries? Tell me. Bulliraju, our country needs sincere police officers like you. We need honest men like you. But how can you do this when you get angry? Public would get frightened; right? Why will they come to you and share their problems? The public should lot at police and feel that they have a support. You must give them that confidence. Ok? One final advice! Anger itself is the enemy. Do not forget. When we believe that killing the criminals and offenders, Would bring welfare to thousands of people, We have been doing the same even now after we make a discussion on it, And also giving some warnings. But presently, in order to announce our strength, and to deprive the police strength, It is not a right thing to brutally kill the innocent cops who wouldn't bug us. I did not like our act. They are also humans like us. Chandra, why didn't you bother to tell me when you were doing this? Mr Gopal Reddy, why do you talk like this? Are the police innocent? They have been unfairly killing many of our people in a brutal way. They are killing innocent people for us. Gone are those days when we used to bring change by conducting rallies and meetings. The answer for that is tit for a tat. It is alright if some of us even die in this war unknowingly. Listening to you all these days, we used to think of achieving it all in five years. It is fifteen years now and what have we achieved? It is wrong Chandra. A change does not come so fast. This is a war from 1000 years. It is not our policy, to take revenge on police for losing many of our people as said by you. We are people thinking to do something for the public. In such a case, public should fear seeing us. Our war is for all the public to live fearless, with equality and independent. But, with such practices it is a loss for us and nothing else. Reddy Sir, you have grown old. You are fearing for everything. It is better for us all to once sit and talk about you. That means you do not need me. Am I grown old? [Blast] [Gunfire] [Groaning] [Gunfire] Retreat Gopal Reddy sir, come. [Gun shot] Reddy sir! Hey! [Groaning] [Gun shot] I will come on the Sunday, baby! I will bring dress and gifts for you, baby! I will come on the Sunday, baby! I will bring dress and gifts for you, baby! -On Monday -I will come baby I will come on Monday, baby! I will bring soap and powder for you, baby! What Chanti, looks like you got a new dress stitched? Today is birthday of Chanti, dude. -Good colour dude. -Yes, right? I got it stitched in Rajahmundry and it costed a lot dude. -How much for this? -Why for you, bloody? -Oh, have you seen it to Baby then? -Oh no, Baby! Hey Baby! [Temple bell ringing] [Temple bell sound] [Chants] -Baby! -Move on dude Baby! [Instrumental music] "Hai dudes, she is like a guava" "Hai dudes, she is like a guava" "Which is sweetly moving in front of our eyes" "What a beauty with beautiful shape and skin" "What a beauty with beautiful shape and skin" "It would be great if it becomes mine. Oh Gosh!"

Oh Gosh!" [Instrumental music] "Like a beautiful tender coconut leaf of Kona Seema" "and a sacred Tulasi plant in the sunrise" "Like a marigold flower grown in the backyard" "and a mango pickle that is tasted with curd rice" "Like a cute doll and Indian roller" "Which is crossing the shore of Godavari river" [Splash] "This girl seems like a honey drop, rain drop" "And the nose ring of the old lady" "Hai dudes, she is like a guava" "Hai dudes, she is like a guava" [Instrumental music] "Like Savitri from old Telugu movie" "Like the light glowing in temple" "Like the droplet on lotus leaf" "And like a colourful rangoli on the entrance of a home " "Like a baby fish, moon" "and a cute Jasmine bud" [Slap] -Hey stop dude! -Oh my God! "She is like a sugarcane crop, a festival bonfire" "and a doorstep painted with turmeric powder" "Hai dudes, she is like a guava" "Hai dudes, she is like a guava" "Which is sweetly moving in front of our eyes" "What a beauty with beautiful shape and skin" "What a beauty with beautiful shape and skin" "It would be great if it becomes mine. Oh Gosh!" "Hai dudes, she is like a guava" "Hai dudes, she is like a guava" Hey Police, throw a joker dude. -Daddy! -What dudes playing cards? -See dad, he is teasing me. -Who, this Chanti? -Yes. -What is he saying son-in-law? Nothing father in law. As some idiot may tease her while going to college, I am safeguarding daily. She is misunderstanding that. Throw this dude. -Oh no, joker! -Thank God, I got life. -Oh no, joker! - Thank God, I got life. Thank God, Chanti is a good fellow baby. You are misunderstanding. -You bloody fellow. -Baby, bring two coffee. -Slipper would break. -You bloody fellow. -What is that? Send two coffee baby. -Bloody. -Give it here bloody. -It is mine. -Every tom and Dick comes to play cards. -It is mine. Move aside, you bloody. Every idiot gets ready. Yes, we threw the joker down. Hey, it seems Police have killed Gopal Reddy. They are saying it is an encounter. -Who is Gopal Reddy? -Fool. Doing MA and donating wealthy property to poor, He risked his life and had done great deeds. He is not of idiot batch like us to live on the property of in laws. -Yes! Burning trains pouring petrol, -Avoid it killing police by blasting, collapsing the bridges, stealing the guns are all great good deeds. You bloody fellow! Playing cards with Khaki dress, not going to station for other than salary, taking bribes, doing murders and rapes in Police Station, running behind the cars of Ministers -Not showing even show is over -What? -Shut your mouth. -Ok -Show dude! -What? Come on take out the money. Here are your cards. -Not mine. -Take, bloody. Not your money, but that taken from public, right? Come on give. Hey foreign, how much is yours? -It is full meals dude. -I see. [Chants] -Hey foreign, your mother in law. -Oh no! Take out the cards. What Bairagi, why has the paper come so late today? What, is this all the fear? Do not give bloody show off. Shut up dude. How many ever dramas you play, She will not give you the property of your wife. I too will see how she does not give it. Till she gives relations between that and this houses are cut. -I got that wall built just for that. -Leave the wall. You built at your height so that I cannot see my daughter. Due to my bad fate, I gave my daughter to you in marriage with wealthy properties. But you gambled it all going for prestige, and finally left her with just her chain in neck. Maybe you have been watching out for the property my daughter would get if I die. I will not die so soon. Stop that over action and try to earn money. What are you bloody? You are grown up so big and cannot earn even a single rupee. Oh God! [Slipped] Thayaru! Oh no, this bloody old lady does not sit calm at all. -Oh no, think leg is broken. -Why all these at this age for you? -You do not appoint a maid when said. -Tumbler is gone. Wait, I will bring it. Move on. She is grown old. Poor old lady. -Bloody house, nothing is found in its place. -What? -No idea, where is it? -What are you searching baby? Your mom fell down and I am going to apply balm. - Grandma! -Leg is just twisted. -Wait Bairagi. -Where are you hurt? Being old, why do you not just sit instead of all these? -See now. Say where are you hurt. -Oh no! Instead of keeping a fight with my father and getting troubled so, Why do you not throw that bloody land to him? -Will you take it along when you die or what? -Oh no! Bloody! See Bairagi, how is she talking without considering even the age. Reporting to that fellow? -What would you do bloody? -Oh man! What bloody? What is his age and your age? It is our wish, we are friends from childhood. What's for you? Yes, it is happened so because of interfering so in between. You would say whatever as my son is not in the village. Yes, that dumb fellow is correct for you. He is on roads leaving his mother behind. He is not on roads, but is in Police training. Oh no, that one thing is lesser for that face. When is he coming from Police training grandma? [Water burbling] [Launch whirring] [People murmering] Hey Bulliraju is here. Start music idiots [Whistle] [Orchestra] -What Bairagi? -Welcome to Bulliraju sir. Hey, what is all this? Why do you say that? After so many years you alone have returned becoming a Police from our waste batch. -That is why we are garlanding you. -No way. Will you be calm and get this done? Do not play crazy. -I will kill if you garland me. No. -Come on, take this. -Catch him and do not leave him. -Yes. [Splash] Don't lose him. Hold him [People cheering] What is this seven on each side like small kids? All fourteen on one side and I alone on a side. Challenge! Anybody with guts, 10 rupees is my bet. What is 10 like a dame? 100 rupees bet. Ok! Yours is a 100 and mine is 10. It is a bet, ready. [People cheering] Pull him back, come on pull. [People cheering] Come on Chanti, come. Bloody get up! [Fighting sounds] Will you play false games? I will kill you. Hey Bulliraju, what is this? Leave him. Bairagi, do not stop me. I will not leave this fellow. You should play a game like a game. Stop bloody. -Leave him. - I will not leave him, but kill him. Hey bring both idly and Wada. Just in inches, I lost a hundred rupees. He ruined it like Mahatma Gandhi. -Do we not know? It was a bet. -Who is it? -That Bulliraju fellow. -Even that is for me. You eat that first and two varieties for you again. It is ok, how did they give Police job to that Bulliraju? Why, should they not give? They gave you and why not for him? -You are talking too much Chanti. -So what? What bloody? You eat here daily and have you ever paid him? -He will not take from me. -My foot, you do not have the habit to pay. Say a truth bloody. Do you go daily to Police station? Have you ever done the duty? Do you know how is that, bloody? -You bloody fellow, dress again for you. - Oh no! Hey, collect money from this fellow today including my total old balance. -Total? -Even that of next week too. -Sorry Bairagi. -No problem dude. I was in anger and did so. I do feel why all these for me. But, cannot stay calm seeing all that. I get angry. -Why did you get wet so dear? -Just before in Godavari. Leave that. Have a bath and come. I will serve you food. -You too stay back guys. -Ok. -Hey Sathi, why do eat the raw bloody! -Good one. Will that Chanti fellow not change? Does he not have an idea to settle in life? Hey, at least you people change. Do not waste time roaming idle. Even a second if wasted, does not come back. [Silence] Bloody, I will beat you up. -Do not play with me. -Whom? Whom is he scolding dudes? Hey, instead of standing so why do you not dry up these pieces? We are already in confusion not knowing as to whom he is scolding and added is you. [Music] What are you doing? Why are you peeping that side? Do not mess so with me. Go and mess at your Police station, bloody. -What are seeing so, bloody? -You bloody! Stop baby! You bloody rowdy! -Bairagi! -You! -Grandma! -Hey Bulliraju! Mom, please catch her. Do not leave. -Hey stop! -Catch him tight. Do not leave. Hey grandma, Ask your son to roam in dress. He is so bad looking. -I am unable to see him so. -Oh no! [Music] Ok, this gun is ok for us. Oh my God! Super gun! [Imitating a soldier firing rounds] [Chuckles] -Do not laugh. -Hey bloody. I think you still do not know the matter. I and your dad spoke it all. Our marriage is on March 10. Have you understood? -Your teeth would fall out. -No problem. Maybe, you are thinking to marry that Bulliraju. No way. I and you should marry only me. Ok? Never laugh again. [Puffing] That is all and so much build up for this? You move aside bloody. Why do you not marry that Chanti as thought by your father? I will kill you bloody, if you give dirty advises to marry Chanti. No, not that dear. I mean what is your feeling? Shall I say it again? I will marry only my maternal uncle. Go on. How can I? I need to know what he is thinking, right? -You need our help for that. -Yes. That is it, right? We are too experts in this matter. I had around 42 love affairs in those days. -Why have you not married till now then? -Shut up. That was because I could not say no to anyone. But, is not so in your case. I will easily get your marriage done. Ok. We need to finalise matter of Bulliraju first, move on. -Bloody, catch the bowl properly. -Faster, eyes are burning. You do not listen when I say to bath with shampoo. You bathed all these days with shampoo, right? -It is good bathing with soap nuts. -Bulliraju! -Are you having a head bath? -No bloody, I am having food. -Keep the head straight, bloody. -You hold on mom. Instead being troubled so, why do you not appoint someone? Who else would bath my son if not me? Why, will wife not do if you get him married? You are right. Find a good match. Why do you say good match again with Baby beside the wall? Yes, you marry Baby dear. - No, it will not set with them for us. Her dad may be an idiot, but she is good. She does all works great. She had made the pickle day before and… What, had Baby prepared that pickle? - Yes. -What, has Baby made that soft and tasty pickle? -Yes. Hey Bairagi! You are talking too much. That was made by mom and I know that. Leave whoever did that, but let us marry Baby. -What, will you too marry? -Mad fellow! If you want, you marry. Do not play dramas keeping her behind me. Oh no, who is behind you? There is none other the flower twig. Tin full of powder she applied is saying that she is behind me. Have you identified so? Do not mess with the Police, you will be booked bloody. Yes! [Music] Babe is great like the tender coconut piece dude. Yes dude! What baby, how much are these tomatoes? How much are these? Leave that and say what is your rate? What dudes? Police fellow is worried there for men to play cards and what are you doing here? -We came to see the garden. -What? We came to see the garden. -Have you seen? -Yes. -Leave now, then. -We are leaving. Will we stay back instead of leaving or what? This bloody fellow in between. Leave it, it costs 50 paisa again. You leaving those making fun of you and hitting me for eating two tomatoes, You are great! What Satyanarayana, how is the health? Are you fine? What is the news in the paper? It seems Baby has given some dress to stitch and she asked me to enquire. Oh tomorrow? Is your health keeping fine? -Take butter milk Bairagi. -Are you fine? We are just living so. Thank God, work I came for is done. Need to search for lunch now. What Laxmi, you are not to be seen from four days? I thought of coming myself, but my maternal uncle has come. I am too busy. I am trying a lot to make that dumb face smile. It is almost impossible for me. His face would be good even if he does not smile. -Sorry madam. -Ok, will you have a coffee? -Coffee! -No! No idea why but, I am forgetting myself just by taking his name, Laxmi. Ok, have you not found any prince still? Hey, say the truth. You naughty! -You! -Here. Wow, have you stitched so fast? Wow, it is so good. Bairagi! If I wear this and try my uncle on my birthday, he would get flat. Here is the money Baby. -Is your father fine dear? -Yes -Why, what happened to him? -You shut your mouth. I will take leave. Naughty girl! That is a donating hand but not the accepting one. They lived great once. Her father Satyanarayana owned around two to three hundred acres once. He donated with one hand and played cock fights with the other. He finally left half an acre. In that she is cultivating vegetables and tailoring to run the house decently. If someone asks me who is the best girl in this surrounding area, I would say name of Laxmi. -Does that mean Baby is not a good girl? -You shut your mouth. That means, am I not a good girl? That is you are a naughty girl. -Naughty girl means not a good girl, right? -Don't trap me [Splash] Get up bloody! [Rooster crows] Ramudu, if he listens would say to run even in the afternoon. What again, bloody? Hey, I am an elder man. I pray you, leave me. What to leave? What about you, bloody? You are a Police and you need exercise. Why for us, you are killing us early in the morning? Not just Police, but everybody needs to exercise. We can achieve anything only when the body is fit enough. -No, we will not do. -Move, move on. -What about you? -What? Will you hit even me? -Move bloody. -Oh no, he is really hit me. [Thrashing] Hey, they are killing Malli by beating up. Move. Stop! Why are you hitting him? What has he done? What has he done, debt! He mortgaged this land to him and did marriage of his sister. No idea about his accounts, but he equalised the debt with this land. He is beating him to sign for this fertile land, right sir? Bloody, will we be silent if he is beating? Come on, we shall go and give a complaint in the Police station and settle his matter. What Bulliraju, what is this Police Station newly? -Nothing would happen there. -Nothing? I will show you what a Police Station is. Come, bloody fellow. Report? [Smacking] What bloody? You maintain a gang following? What is the report you give on Narayana, bloody? You revolt over Narayana, bloody? Why are you not signing when he is saying, bloody? Who is in support here for you? Sign, bloody. Hey Bulliraju, what is your relation with this Malli? Is he any relative to you? Look, you are still in the training period. If you involve into unnecessary issues, you would lose even the job to come. Take care. -Get out bloody. -Move on Bulliraju, why for us. Move. See you sir. Put on the buttons. Move on guys. Why all this for us, move. Why does he say how am I related? Should only the people of the guy getting hit ask? Should others not ask? To say a mistake as wrong, we need not be his relative. Will we become a radical by questioning? He is like a goon in dress, but not like a Police. That is why public lost respect on the Police. Hey, you would leave soon to join in the job. Why all these issues of village for you? Do not speak nonsense. Police station means the Government in reach of public. We are paying taxes and giving them salaries for us. It is that they save us. Public is shivering to get into the Police station. They are fearing to the Police. We shall catch neck and question the Police not working, but should not be frightened. We heard many as such. Once you get the dress on you, would become double to him. -Bairagi, do not speak nonsense. -Uncle, sweet! Get away bloody. Oh no, today is her birthday. She came with so much affection. Oh no! Why do you show the anger over Police on Baby? Poor girl, you made her cry on her birthday. Go and say sorry. Ok, his short temper is his beauty. [Water burbling] [Clearing throat] I am sorry Baby. I am really sorry. You know Baby that I am short tempered. Added you suddenly came when we all were seriously talking, And I could not control anger. I am really sorry. I brought this saree for your birthday. I have been thinking to give from the day before. But could not. Take. [Instrumental music] "This swinging heart does not stay calm" "No idea what happened to me" "This swinging heart does not stay calm" "No idea what happened to me" "I have been thinking this would happen some day" "I am into a trance as it is happening today" "He said something, is it yes or a no?" "My age says whether to stop or to move on" "Though it is a daily habit, I feel shy today to look at him" "His looks have some magic, did I get to know this shyness all these days" "If you say why fear by listening to his foot steps" "What to say, he made shivers throughput the body" "This swinging heart does not stay calm" "No idea what happened to me" [Instrumental music] "Come on dear saree, what happened to you today" "What happened to this weight all these days?" "Who would say whether this is pleasure or not as I am into a confusion?" "I feel like saying him with a promise that I cannot live if he is not seen" "This swinging heart does not stay calm" "No idea what happened to me" "This swinging heart does not stay calm" "No idea what happened to me" I felt like killing him right there Sir. That fellow is in uniform, but is not behaving like a cop. There is no dirty deed that he has not done. He files false cases on those who question and beat up pushing into the lock up. I am feeling ashamed to say that I too am a cop seeing him, sir. One way it is good for people like SI Swamy to come in your way. We teach you in the training as to how a Police should be. You should learn how you should not be, seeing people like SI Swamy. Does that mean you are supporting that fellow? -I am not supporting man. -Sorry sir, I have not noticed. That is alright. I am saying about the situations. Never again forget to put the buttons on, ok? Come on. [Movie playing] What is this nuisance instead of playing romantic movies? You shut up. I came to see as it came for free and why do you ask me. What do I know? [Movie playing] Have you put on all the locks properly to the house? I have locked hubby. Hey, move side. [Cheering] Hey, play again from start. -It is not possible sir. -What Not possible, bloody? -Not possible to play again sir. -Please. What are you still talking to him dude? Wait, I am talking to him. [Movie playing] [Movie screen burning] [People panicking] [Music] -What are you doing? -What is this? [Thrashing] Hubby! Please leave me. [Thrashing] I beg you please. I bow to you. Hubby! I pray to you. Hey Sattipandu, there is a meaning in me and you fearing. What about him? You have no family and I have. ___ -That is why I did not join in Police job. -You shut your mouth. I beg you please. Please leave me, no. Where are the land papers? Do not harm my husband. I will bring them. [Papers burning] [People celebrating] From now, all these lands are yours. Start the work exactly in 15 days. You have got no fear. [People cheering] [Music] [Woman weeping] Oh no, Narayana! What happened? What are these wounds? Who hit you? Come, we shall go to the Doctor. Let us go and complain in the Police station. Come. Why do you say nothing, when you are bleeding so much? Come. Oh no! Who are these to come into the village with guns, give judgements and shoot? What is this goondaism? We have put a system like Police station and court to settle when an issue happens. Who are these to say no to a system accepted by crores from 50 years? 500 Kgs of silver, 40 Kgs of gold and 700 pairs of sandals in the house of Ex-CM Bairagi! Which did not happen from 10 years roaming around police station and courts is settled on road in just 10 minutes. Why do you say who are those? Public are saying at least this much of justice is coming as they exist. Why do you too support them? I do not understand, why do public watch it like a movie? Why does anyone not ask what is this? Getting up in the morning, eating, roaming, sleeping and giving birth to kids. Bloody, there is no other work for the public. He is started it again dude. Not that Bairagi, I feel what you did is wrong and kill you. Will I become correct? Tomorrow someone feel me wrong and kill me. Will he become correct? Is there no system at all? If this killing continues, no human but only corpses would be left to do justice or injustice. Why do you catch the goons and say them great? Ok, they are not great people. According to you, we go and complain in the Police station when such things happen. That is our system. That means like we reported in the morning to SI Swamy. Gun was great dudes. It was glittering. I felt it like hairs of Baby when I touched it dudes. How had Narayana tortured public all these days? He shut his mouth all of a sudden, when was shown a gun. That is what is it power. Whatever, but people like us should at least have a gun. I will play with everybody. Yes dude, they sell foreign goods in that lane of Rajahmundry right? Will a good gun be available there? We shall buy even if it costs a thousand. -What to buy? -How then? Look for a Police, beat him and pull away his gun. I will push both of you in the lock up if you do nuisance. Shut up and sleep. We have just seen in there. I feel it is better we directly go to them and try. Correct dude, you be on that job. [Imitating gun sound] [People singing and bathing] What dudes, is it already a week that you are taking bath? What, with a soap? What dude? Shoes, stick and this Gun on the shoulder? Are you going to duty by mistake or what dude? SI is crying if I am not going on duty for at least once a week. Hey, do not ring the bell. Do not take out the air. Hey, do not take out the stick. Oh no, my gun! Hey, my gun dude! Chanti, you look great dude. Give my gun back, Chanti! I pray to you dude, give back my gun. SI would scold me dude. It would fire dude. [Gun shot] Bloody idiots, you broke my good pot. To hell with you. Curse your life. [Puking] Malarial infection as he is new to the forest. He needs to get habituated. I injected him and no problem. You need not worry. Doctor Sir, many thanks for the help you are doing to us. What have I done for you? I gave treatment as I am a Doctor. Wait, I will bring the tablets. Oh no! You made them escape. How long are you working in this group? -I do not know anything. -You do not know anything. -Shall we go out in the fresh air? -For what? Let us just be back in 10 minutes. We will go till the river shore and come back. -Give a colour soda dude. -Why is this fellow taking the Doctor? What is he taking him for? I have some doubt. [Camera shutter sound] Doctor Sir, Please say the truth. How long are you working in this group? I do not know anything about all these groups, Inspector sir. -Oh no, mother promise! -I really do not know anything. I am living by running a small hospital. Do not harm me. I have kids, please leave me. Please do not harm me. Ok, you do not know anything. I need to leave you. Ok, I left you. Go! You need to go by running. Go away Doctor Sir. Go before my mood changes. Faster, your wife and kids would be waiting at home. Run! Go, come on run. [Music] [Gun shot] Famous terrorist Doctor Sekhar killed in encounter. Doctor Sekhar of Gajulapalem village died, in the encounter taken place yesterday evening. Local SI Swamy informed that he had links with terrorists from a long time. He said to have been with an information, that terrorists are meeting up in Doludandi forest, and they started to fire once they reached there. He informed that a terrorist died in the firing for self-protection and the rest have escaped into the darkness. They identified the dead terrorist as Doctor Sekhar. SI Swamy informed that he is a main member of the terrorist group and to have taken heavy load of guns and ammunition at the place of encounter. I will not believe. It is on the whole, a lie, made up story and a cooked up one. All this is the drama being played by bloody SI Swamy. He took Doctor from the hospital, killed him and is saying story. What is he a terrorist? He thinks thrice even when asked for an injection. I will not believe. Hey Bairagi, who is Doctor Sekhar? The day when you were about to die after drinking adultered arrack, and total village thought you would be dead, The man who gave you medicine and saved you is this, you bloody fellow. What are you still here? You heard it all, right? Come on start now. Go and look into your works. Story is over. -Great Doctor! -A Godly man! Though he had a chance to go abroad and earn a lot of money, He came to this village to uplift the people. So he had set up a hospital in this village and treated freely. He also used to give money to the labourers. Swamy idiot has cruelly shot and killed that great Doctor helpful to the public. Bloody rascal! Oh no! Why are you not coming even after repeatedly asking? We bought a luxurious house in Rajahmundry. You can stay along with your parents. Will you come? What dude? I, he and that fellow keep coming on alternate days for fun. Ok? Decide and say something by evening. [Fighting sounds] Hey, Chanti is hitting. Come on dudes. [Fighting sounds] Chanti is killing us. He is beating us. Come on dudes. [Splash] Drown him. Come on, drown him. [Fighting sounds] I will kill, if you look at that girl again. [Panting] [Music] Hai re hai, she is like a guava fruit! Is Baby in? Oh no, is Baby in? Is Baby there? No, you do not know English right? Sorry! Baby! Turmeric has gone high, bring it down and you look great. [People singing] What Laxmi, why are you standing alone? [Chuckles] What happened to Venkata Laxmi? -May be she gave her heart. -You shut your mouth. Always talking nonsense. [Silence] [Music] [Chuckles] [Temple bell rings] [Rooster crows] [Door opens] [Music] You do Rangoli great. Why do you not keep another coconut? What happened? Hey dear, bring some feed for that hen. They are starving. Hey son in law, I had yesterday been to Rajahmundry Doctor. Why? He said handicapped kids would be born by getting marriages done in the family. I was frightened. We think many during childhood. Is there any rule that all those need to happen? Nothing so. I understood recently that my daughter would be happy with a better match. So, after this no moon day… who else would I find better than you for my daughter? You are correct. I will give her to you in marriage and you can come to my house itself. -We both can then enjoy together. -Yes, we shall. What have you left behind to enjoy? When two waste fellows get together is again a waste. You came to my house and emptied it and he would come now and clean it. As I ruined my daughter getting married to you now you are doing with him. Get down, you bloody idiot. Looking like an owl bloody. Are you planning to ruin life of her? Listen, do not play crazy. I will get your daughter married only to my son. If there is a difference coming in this, I will see your end. Bloody fellow, who else can be waste than you. Son in law, you do not be tensed. [Sound of peeling coconut] -Catch properly Bulliraju. -Why are you looking so? How much is the rate of coconut? Danger is coming there and are you happily counting coconuts here? What, has your father seen a match again for marriage? Get married, one tension will be gone. Uncle! Hey, what happened? I just said for fun and that is it. And you so… Baby, your dad fixed the match for you and me. I do not like you speak so with all Tom, Dick and Harry. Move. I will break your teeth, speaking crazy. What to break, move on to the house. [Punch] [Fighting sounds] Bairagi! [Fighting sounds] Hey Chanti, stop! Hey Bulliraju, stop. Stop dude. Bloody, I will kill you If you mess with Baby again. Baby is my would be wife. I will peel your skin if you see her again. Bloody. [Thunder rumbling] Calling from Gajulapalem station. Yes, Gajulapalem station reporting. Total district knows about Biryani of Ajanta. What do you know bloody? Hey, who are you bloody? I came from the neighbouring village sir. I came to buy cattle in the market tomorrow. It is night now and I have money with me. I do not know anyone here sir. For the night.. -You want to sleep? -Yes. Go and sleep there in the Veranda. [Nightfall sound] Hey! What? Hey, what is this? Why have you come so? What? Do you have any work? Why is she not talking? Hey, go home. If you do not like going that way, go this side. No idea, where is this bloody Bairagi. Has sister slept? Oh no, what happened to her? What is this, printed upside down? Oh no! Will you drink water? They taste good. Will you leave or not? Go! Hey Baby, please leave. Please leave. I beg you. I am tensed dear. Bulliraju, hey Bulliraju! [Door opens] Hey, SI has asked to bring you. Bloody, what is your problem? Fighting with everyone and hitting each other on roads, do you think as heroes? Still, what is this fighting for a girl instead of happily enjoying? Shut up and talk properly. -What to talk straight bloody? -You rascal. Why are you hitting? You have no right to hit even the criminal. I have been seeing from the day I came here. I will have to report on you and your deeds here to the higher officials. [Officers chuckling] Oh no, it seems he would report to higher officials. What is the report you would give, bloody? What is that? -On whom would you report? -Hey bloody! Leave bloody. Hey, stop dudes. Stop you bloody without any sense. What is all this? Who do you think he is? Sir, be seated. -Sir, no anger please. -You bloody! I beg you, please be seated sir. Keep even that left leg sir. Sir, be seated. Hey, you too be seated. Here, have it sir. Bloody, I will kill if you attack him. Who do you think he is? He is a kind man. Have it sir. I am a fatherly person sir. Please. I know about your kind heart, but those idiots do not know sir. They are fools sir. I will tell them sir, you do not show anger on them. Please do not harm them sir. This village has bettered a lot after you came here sir. We always speak about you sir. Please have this sir. Please leave them sir. Sir, did they pour drink? Please have it. I have mixed soda. Hey come on move. See you sir. Move on dudes, see you sir. Move on bloody. What are you bloody wearing his dress. Careful sir. See you sir. Move on bloody. See you sir. The Police selection method itself has a mistake. They are just seeing for height, chest, eye sight and physical fitness. But nobody is seeing the character. A Police need the character in real. The zeal to help the public and a respect over the humans. Where are these? Not just the Police, but every department is so. Has at least one has the feel to do his duty perfectly? They have been eating up the country in wrong ways, but none has the responsibility. Oh my God, what are these meetings in the midnight? Tomorrow is the Bhogi festival and think where to light the fires. [Phone ringing] [Blast] [People groaning] -Bloody, he escaped. -He still is left with life in fate. Bloody fellow, we shall see how he escapes the next time. We will see the right time and kill him. Hey, catch this. Careful. See you, today is the festival and I need to take head bath. Hey Raghava, they are total 16. See inside, there may be still bombs inactive. I was saved very luckily sir. I had been to Devipatnam in the night to attend a theft case. To his house and it happened so, by then. I have an information that few in this village have links with the Terrorists. This is their deed. If you give me permission, [People singing a folk song] [Instrumental music] "What a difficulty has come to this sensitive baby, my God?" "We need to take care of Baby, what evil sight fell on her?" "She is into sweating with this work" "Those cheeks have become like fire drops" "She is into sweating with this work" "Those cheeks have become like fire drops" [Instrumental music] "Here is the old cot, I brought it and this will burn great" "Cards said to play and enjoy dear" "This bloody cock is getting ready to fight" "Hey my Dove, how cute are you even in anger?" "I will not be flat saying such sweet words" "My uncle would see your end if you do not stop that" "Oh my God, see her mischief" "She is been teasing me, though is mine" "For this beautiful song" "Smile and join the chorus" [Instrumental music] "Whatever we object, these soap nut shower is still giving us jitters" "What is that bloody sleep like a dumb fellow?" "Drive away this chilling cold and let sweat come" "This looks great, come on celebrate this" "Sweets being cooked in all houses is good" "But we would not get any non-vegetarian anywhere" "Sankranthi festival has come and brought celebrations" "Sacred ox has come home and pray to it" "Look big festival is come to the houses of Telugu people" "Look it is brought a new day into the houses of happiness" "Sankranthi festival has come and brought celebrations" "Sacred ox has come home and pray to it" "Sankranthi festival has come and brought celebrations" "Sacred ox has come home and pray to it" [Police charging] Hey, come on bloody. Hey leave me. Why are you taking that fellow? What to say you bloody? Push even this fellow. Stop bloody, leave. -Uncle! -Bulliraju! -My son! -Do not be tensed. -You go inside. Go in. -Bulliraju! Be careful, I will be to the police station and enquire the matter. -Ok. -Careful! Why have you brought here, instead of taking to the Police station? Keep him there so and we shall him later. Hey, do not harm Sattipandu. He does not know anything. Sattipandu, how many are you? What how many? I do not know anything. -How many are you? -Said you, right sir? Bloody, who has kept the bomb? Say bloody. -Say bloody. -Hey! Tell bloody. What do you think bloody, you put bombs? Hey bloody fellow! Who is your leader? Tell bloody. [Shouting] [Groaning] [Screaming in pain] You bloody rascal. Bloody, you put bomb in Police station itself? Yes bloody. We put the bombs and killed the Police. Sattipandu, do not say lies. We actually put the bombs to kill you. But you escaped bloody. If not today, we will kill you later for sure. -Why, will you kill? -He is a mad guy. Leave him. If needed, book a case. Inspector, no. Do not shoot. Please. I beg you, please no. Hey Sattipandu! Inspector, no! [Gun shot] Hey bloody! Leave me. Bloody Swamy! [Fighting sounds] Move. Come on, pull him. [Gun shot] What are you looking at? Come and pull him. [Gun shot] [Gun shot] [Gun shot] [Groaning] [Gasping] Bulliraju! Run away. Go! [Gun fire] Oh no! [Gun fire] Come fast. [Gun fire] [Moped moving] [Fleeing] [Music] Stop Chandra, I am Bairagi. He is our guy. He killed Inspector Swamy. I brought him. Bairagi! You are... Yes, I am also a... Te... Terrorist... No! Oh God! [Groaning] Bulliraju, have tea. MBBS Doctor, he did Government service for 2 years and came here, unable bear the corruption there. Chandra is a Gold Medallist from Warangal Engineering College. All these people... Enough! Bulliraju, where are you going? I understood it all. I have no belief in you and am leaving. I will join in Police job once I get the posting. -Bulliraju! -What, I have not killed SI Swamy. It just happened accidentally. I have not killed him. "Gajulapalem SI shot dead, cruelty of terrorist in the face of Police" [Police drill] -Why are you given these jobs? -He has started. Come later. Is it to just wear uniforms and take salaries on the 1st? Do you know what is happening? Have they not blasted landmine day before and killed Police? Yesterday, have they not blasted the Police station? Have they not killed the SI today? I feel ashamed for all these to be happening in the district, I am an in-charge. I am frightened to even go to that village. You know that all our properties are in that village. Though my father is at centre and I am in state, they put flags in my land too. We have sat silently unable to do anything. -What happened about appointing a special officer? -May I come in? -Sir! -Are you the special officer? -Sincere officer! -You stay calm. How are you Prasad? In his district and mainly in the forest area, law and order is gone vanished. Terrorists are almost running a parallel Government. There is no safety to the lives of Police going to that district. They are killing everyone coming into their reach. Killing an SI in front of 100 Police and escaped means, it is a shame. This is an open challenge for our department. Thus I am giving you this responsibility. I do not know what you would do, But terrorism should not be there in this district. Ok? -Sir! -You can go. It seems that Bulliraju killing SI is our Police trainee, right? A Police? Bulliraju? [Music] [Siren] [Police vehicles moving] [Police drill] They are killing our fellow Police cruelly and without any mercy. They are blasting all the vans fixing landmines. They are cutting hands and legs saying innocent people as informers. They are not even considering women and kids to burn trains and blast the bridges. They have almost taken 1000 lives in just one year. A thousand people. They have been blinded by ignorance where they don't know their purpose, And getting away killing people like animals. These cruel acts should not take place in the future from now. We are not sitting here without any courage. Let us shut the mouths saying Police job is just for living. Let us show the power of this dress to them. Anyone doubtfully seen, push them in immediately. Whatever happens later, I will take care of that. Ok? One thing. Public is not for us, but we are here for the public. We shall give them the confidence that they have the Police security. No matter whoever the terrorist is, We should make them get no shelter or not even a food grain in these villages. Okay? I shall pamper your cheek, oh my cute dear My dear moon from the stars, -Pamper my cheeks -Police attack, run [Music] Raju and everyone, come here. You go that side, Venkat go this side and we cover from the back. Come on, let us move. No, Police may have come for me. I do not like you killing each other in between. Bulliraju, you are not understanding the real problem. They brutally killed Sattipandu. We will not leave them at any situation. The SI killing Sattipandu is dead, right? Killing the Police in no way related to that now is not justified. Is it not so, killing our men on the name of encounter? -Chandra! -Bulliraju! Police have taken your mother. Killing a Police officer is not any small crime. We have orders even to shoot at sight. Ask Bulliraju to surrender immediately. At least he would be left alive. I do not know where he is. He did not come to me. Do not say so. I will not believe. Your stubbornness may become the reason for his death. Only I in this world can help him. Think about this. For hiding a criminal, Do not push me into a situation where I would take action you. Please tell. Where is Bulliraju? Looks like they are all behind. Hey, silence. Greetings sir. You should not go anywhere leaving this village. I know Bulliraju very well. But have not thought that he would cheat even me. I liked him a lot thinking is good, sincere guy and would do something for public. I thought he would someday become a good Police officer. But, it has not happened so. Joining hands with Terrorists, he joined in Police training to act and know our secrets. He cheated us, no he cheated me. He killed a Police officer. I will not spare him. I will not leave that guy. Whatever information you get about him, you should immediately come and inform me. Ok? [Door opens] [Gasping] [Panting] [Shutting doors] Mom! Bulliraju, open up! Open, I say. [Knocking] [Knocking] I know that you are in. Open up, I say. [Gun fire] Stop, do not shoot. Don't shoot, I say. [Gun fire continues] -Stop! Don't shoot. -Sir. [Gun fire] Mohan! [Gun fire] Take positions. [People fleeing] [Gun fire] [Gun fire] [Little girl crying] Oh no, kid! Kid! Don't shoot. Stop, stop firing. Kid! Kid! [Gun fire] Kid! Kid is there, don't shoot. Warning! Hands up, Bulliraju! I am warning you. -Sir! -Shut up. Come on, move. [Blast] [Gasping] [Music] What happened to them, no sound? Hello! Oh no, I do not know anything. Leave me. Shut up. I know this fellow. [Camera shutter sound] Oh God, what has happened? How do I live now without you? Oh God! What happened to you that you killed my husband? Do you not have wife and kids? May your wife become a widow! You did injustice to me and my kid. Do you not have sisters? Is this what you do? You both fighting have taken life of my husband. I curse you should be ruined. -Hey stop! -Press sir. Sir, how many from Police and terrorists have died? Bloody, ask how many humans have died. Not how many Police and terrorists, but ask how many humans have died. Do you not have any humanity in you? Please do not run business on the corpses. No problem even if your press and media does not better society, but do not ruin it. Please do not put fire in public with your crazy writings. Please! [Forest sounds] Chanti is too crazy about guns. He feels roaming like vagabond, betting and holding guns is heroism. Do not let him be here, Chandra. No Bulliraju, there is a fire in him. I have seen him courageously opposing SI Swamy that day in the station. Yes! Today, he saved that kid risking his life. What more is needed? [Gun shot] If he can be prepared, can be very helpful for the public. Chandra, my life is anyways ruined. Do not pull him into this. He does not know anything. He is an innocent guy. Not just him Bulliraju, all the public are innocent. Our country is said to have got independence and it is 50 years now. But, what has happened good? We have a fertile land which no other nation has in the world. But, how many are having stomach full food? Almost 50 out of 100 have no food at all, hunger! Crores of unemployed are circling around the employment offices. Almost 60 crore people in our country have no education. Do you know? No proper medical facilities, no house to live for many. The rich and strong have been looting the poor. The one who ploughs has no right on the land. The one growing crop has no right on it. The one working has no right on the factory. Anywhere seen is this looting. None to question what is this. Even if someone asks, it is again Police stations and an encounter. You have seen yourself as to what happened to Doctor and Sattipandu. They shot them down just like that. It is all rotten boss, bloody crap! How long should this go? A stop should be put for this somewhere. Someone should strongly question about all this. It is not required whether it is you, I or Chanti? One must fight. -Laxmi! -Bairagi, what happened? -What happened? -Laxmi! What happened? I used to say would say name of Laxmi when someone asks for a good girl in the surrounding villages here, I do not know whether you kicked and saved her for putting hands on her or just showed your heroism. But, you forgot to break their hands and limbs. With the anger over you, the day before night! [Burning] [People screaming] Oh no! Save us. [Woman screaming] -Where can those idiots be found now? -I know. Move, move aside. -Baby, have you bought the doll? -Why do you push? It is good, do you want bangles? No problem, take. I will pay the money. Hey, move aside. [Music] [Fighting sounds] Chanti, stop. Are they the guys? If you have the revenge and guts, go and show it. Laxmi, they burnt your house in front of your eyes and burnt your parents in that. They tortured you very cruelly. Laxmi, do not leave them. Nobody should face such a situation. They should never again at any lady. Come on Laxmi, go. Kill them. Hit them Laxmi. Go. [Fighting sounds] Nobody else should a situation like you. Laxmi, kill them. Kill them. Such people should not live. Do not leave them Laxmi. Come on, kill them. Hit them Laxmi. No, please leave us. [Sobbing] [Thrashing] [Sobbing] Laxmi, stay calm. Oh no! [Gun fire] Bulliraju, I like you very much from childhood dude. I used to try a lot to be like you. But as I could not work hard and had none to advise me, I became a waste and you moved forward. I used to get great anger. With that frustration I used to fight with you always. Matter of Baby too is the same. I know how much Baby likes you from childhood. I even know that you both would get married. I used to be behind Baby just to tease you. But, I have nothing else on Baby dude. I am crazy about guns, but I have not come here for them, but for you. I could not be in the village after knowing about what happened to you. I felt to be with you. It does not make much difference either I stay here or in the village. I will be here and with you only. [Music] "The awakening song has called you dear" "The refreshing dance has asked to come dancing" "Hey Bairagi, do not stop this josh today and start the beat" "Let this beat resound in all the villages to make sound" ?Forget about troubles and tears, they keep coming" ?We can do anything if a smile is with us? ?Will some loot everything like vultures? ?and say Jai Hind?? ?Will the public like kids bear this? ?and think as their fate?? ?If they torture to make life unbearable? ?If cruelty closes the path and hunts us? ?Getting frustrated will even the kid turn into a tiger?? ?Hey, small raindrop itself would become a cyclone? This fire ball of today would become a raging fire ?As it becomes dark,? ?Should the world go and ask the Sun to come?? ?As the sin is grown big? ?Should society ask for our help to save them?? ?If there is a revolting fire in the eyes? ?If a raging fire is born in the heart? ?Will everyone with boiling blood not become the Sun?? ?Why should I care if someones house is on fire?? ?It is your duty to move the sleeping one" "Death would come tomorrow if not today and we cannot escape it" "Life is in our hands and will listen to us by leaving out fear" [Gun fire] Chandra! [Gun fire] [Gun fire] [Blast] [Gasping] -Chandra! -Bairagi! By forming into a group of cowards, Will the public like kids bear this and think as their fate? They should not think so. [Gasping] -Chandra! -No! Do not cry. We shall do anything for the public. We shall uplift people. We shall uplift youngsters. Do something [Gasping] [Music] Jai Hind! [Music] [Silence] [People sobbing] Chandra! [Forest sounds] I am not the leader. All are equal here. Let us all together think and take decisions. Each of us should feel those as our own responsibilities. It is corruption, injustice, crime and political cheating everywhere. Our war from now would be on those. But there will not be burning trains and busses, blasting bridges and killing Police from now. We need to take the life of opposite only when it is unavoidable. All the public should live in peace, happiness and freedom. We need to safeguard the rights of public. That is our policy. [Gun shot] [Forest sounds] [Destructing storage of illegal arrack] For playing with families by drowning the innocent into seduction, This is the punishment like you people preparing infiltrated arrack. Chanti! [Thrashing] I will not collect false interests sir. [Gun shot] [Groaning] Murthy! [Police charging] [Thrashing] [Children cheering] You should be happy, you gave back our kids. I will never touch girls, please leave me. [Chants] Girls are very valuable. They came behind you leaving their parents who grew them for 20 years. Take good care of them. If something happens to them, I will punish you. Hail Bulliraju! Sir, I beg you. Please leave me. Due to the arrogance of your brother being local MLA For stealing the forest property snatching it away from the tribal people, This is the punishment for you. [Gun shot] [Blast] Brother would be back, mom. Please have this. You are starving from two days, take at least this mom. [Weeping] -A, B, C, D, E, -Keep the finger here and hand up there. Bloody, what is that? -You bloody fellow. -You! Do not beat me, I will not take bribes. [Thrashing] [Siren] Laxmi, have food. I will watch for some time. [Music] [Thrashing] [Music] Tribal girls hostel, Chintalapalli Someone has come. Do not harm me, do not kill me. I was wrong sir. I will never again do such things. Please leave me sir. You are doing business with orphan girls. This is our punishment to hostel wardens like you. [Gun shot] [Music] [Burning sound] [Thunderstorm] "The courage not to bear injustice?

Thank God, it is been two days since we ate. Come Laxmi, we shall eat. Hey Doctor, come. Food is here. Oh no, it would be so in the start and tastes good once habituated. It is a good food, have it dude. I do not want it dude. [Music] One, two, three, four, five, six, seven [Gun fire] Laxmi good shot. Fire! Fire Hey fatty, do not eat bullet saying to be hungry. Enough dude, from the morning! We are getting bored and will not practice anymore now. You! -Bulliraju! -Down, down Peace now. -What bloody? -Can we go for swimming? Yes, he has smiled. [People cheering] I remember my mom dudes. I do not even have father. I too am feeling like to see my sister. I thought of getting her married this year itself. But, to go there I fear about the Police. It seems, they have already come onto my house twice. Come on dudes, get up. Get up, we will play Kabaddi. Hey Ramarao, you draw the arena. Hey Raghava, yours is a team and mine is the other. Ok? Kabaddi... Come on dudes, we are not able to hold him. Catch him tight, do not leave him. Catch him, fast. [Gun shot] [Gun fire] [Blast] [Silence] -Oh no, it is paining. -Hey Raju! -Raju, what happened? -Paining. Raju, what happened? Venkat, what exactly happened? Why did he die? Looks like some poisonous insect bit him. Police are combing the total forest for us. We lost Imran and Raghava being irresponsible. We need to be very careful from now. We shall never do such mistakes again... [Gun fire] Chanti, bring that. Take good care of him. Hold him carefully. [Gasping] Mom has none and even father is not there. Do something for mom. Do not tell my mom about my death. Mom! [Wind sound] Abdulla, do not drink the water. No Abdulla. Abdulla, what happened? Abdulla! [Gasping] Police have mixed poison in the water. [Temple bells ringing] Bulliraju has completely mixed with them. There is no chance that he would come back. Even if he comes back, Police will not be calm. We cannot do anything else than to pray for his safety. I used to be so just to tease Bulliraju, But I never had intention to get Baby married outside. It is happened so now. What can we do? How many days can we hold the girl in the age of marriage? Thus for good or bad, I finalised marriage of Baby with Bose of Rayudu. Getting married to him, our girl will be in front of our eyes. Added, he would take good care of her. [Music] Imran the day before, then Ramarao, Rajkumar, Abdulla and Raghava One is dying every day like this. I am frightened brother. Not that dude, we came being prepared for everything. How if you get frightened so, now? -Bulliraju! -We... [Music] -What Baby? -Father has finalised my marriage. He is saying a lot about you and I am not understanding anything. I like you very much from childhood. Marriage with another is not possible. Laxmi is here, right? I too will stay here with you. Baby, nobody knows what would happen here anytime. There is no guarantee on life. You know, I do not know when would I die. Still if you say to be here, you are a burden to all of us. You will become a blockage. In such conditions, if something happens to you... Still, I never said to marry you. Do not lie. I will not believe. Shut up and get married to the one your father says. That is good for you. [Gasping] "Hey dear" "My beloved!" [Weeping] [Blast] [Instrumental music] [Blast] "Hey dear" "My beloved" "Dreams in my eyes are yours" "Beats of me heart are yours" "In your breath" "My precious life is swinging" "My dear" "Hey dear, my beloved" "Dreams in my eyes are yours" "Beats of me heart are yours" "In your breath" "My precious life is swinging" "My dear" [Instrumental music] "I never had loneliness" "When I had your thoughts with me" "The blowing breeze became your thought" "And touching me" "Will the separation feel bad" "Saying cannot hide you" "My dear" "Are you a thought or a truth?" "Do you at least know, dear love?" "Whatever I love you" "Whatever you do and even if you cut my heart" "Is it justified to love you," "Or a crime?" "Hey dear" "My beloved" "Dreams in my eyes are yours" "Beats of me heart are yours" "In your breath" "My precious life is swinging" "My dear" [Wedding music] "If he is not seen" "Life says cannot stand" "I feel to promise" "I feel like telling him" What happened? Baby! I like Baby very much Bairagi. Thus as she cannot bear and feeling what would happen if she stays here I said no. Mad girl, she died for me. I thought to become a sincere Police. I thought of marrying Baby and take good care of mom and sister. But what happened now? I am becoming a demon day by day. I am killing humans. Violence! What I used to fight was not correct, I came and fell into that. I am doing the same. By seeing each and every death I feel what I am doing is not correct. But, I do not see any other way. Ok, when are the guns coming? I have already said you day before, right? Why do you not speak up? [Forest sounds] [Vehicle arriving] [Music] Greetings bro! How are you? How is the business? How is your second wife? I will give you money dude. Come on smile. Have you forgotten it in Rajasthan or what? Come on smile. Smil... Srinu! [Gun fire] [Strangling] [Gasping] Hey Bulliraju, they arrested Bairagi. They are hitting him in the station. He is totally bleeding and I fear he may die. [Unlocks door] [Door creaking] [Foot steps] [Wooden stool creaking] Bairagi! Hey Bairagi! I feel pity seeing you. Why all this? Say where is Bulliraju? He is a God for 30 villages. Where would you search for? Whom would you catch? After he caught the gun, there are no powers of landlords, no bribes and no injustice from the officers. No insults for ladies, no false pro-notes, no wrong interests and no Police cruelty. He made lands given to the ones ploughing and hiked the labour charges. -He is doing all your Government should have done. -Shut up. Just shut up. Who are you bloody, to do all those? There is a Government elected by public for that. [Chuckling] Government elected by the public! Elections in our country always happen for three things. Religion, caste and money! He, whose caste is dominant in an area will be given the ticket. He, whose religion people are more will be made the candidate. He, who can throw money and win is made the contestant. If some seat is vacated, either his wife, daughter or son is given the chance. That is for the sympathy votes. This is the election process in our country, my dear Police. How many really qualified are being elected? When the public to ask all these are voting standing in queues, what for you in between? How many are casting their votes? How many are the false, rigged, influenced by arrack and bought by money from the polled votes? How many are the votes of the winner after shared by all the rest? They are 10 out of 100 and winning so are forming the Governments. When such fellows are forming rules, you are protecting those. Tell the name of one leader who can come into public without a gun. But you too are hiding in the forest with same guns, right? Why do you not come into the public? [Splash] [Children cheering] Hail Chalapathi Rao! Come on, bring it. [Camera shutter sound] Hey, get away bloody. Has the video come? -Yes sir. -Go and look into that. -Come on move. -You go on. Hail Minister Sir! Hail to the saviour of womankind! [People canvassing] [Camera shutter sound] [Vehicles arriving] [Gun shot] -What is that sound? -Crackers! [People panicking] [Camera shutter sound] [Vehicles leaving] [Gasping] What is your entire Police department doing? Are you sitting idle? When they kidnapped a Minister in daytime, we understand how waste are you? We are spending crores of public money on you. When there is no safety for VIPs like us, what about the common public? I do not understand, is it the special Police gone to catch them or waste fellows? -You bloody! -Prasad! Please. Leave all this, as per their demands… who is that fellow? -Bairagi! -Yes, release that Bairagi fellow. Say if not, we will do our arrangements. We will get our leader out in an hour. Why do you not say? Shut up, not a word! What are you blabbering bloody? You want to become leader overnight taking such situation as a chance? You are raising too much in front of the press. What do you know the value of life bloody? Daily 10 Police men are dying there. Why does no leader care about that? But you are raising for just one politician today like that Chalapati Rao. Total nation knows about him and his history. Shall we leave that Bairagi whom we caught risking our lives for that bloody fellow? Impossible and I will not leave him. Do whatever you can. If required, go and complain with his father. I don't care. -Prasad! -Sir, the thing is... -Look sir. -Shut up. We know better what and how to do. You do not need to teach us. We will solve this problem in 24 hours. Stay quiet till then. I will peel your skin if you say another word. Just shut up. -Prasad, come on. -Yes sir. Why should we stay quiet sir? Bloody idiots! Goons and bloody pick pocketers are turning into leaders sir. We are having to stand before them folding our hands. When guys without a qualification even to stand with us are saying nonsense. My blood is boiling sir. It is just intolerable. Sir, just give me one chance. I will push all these waste fellows in. Total problem would be solved. Yes! Total problem would be solved. Sir, seeing all this I feel what Bulliraju did is correct. I feel it is better to take off this dress and join them instead of being so sir. Yes sir! -Prasad, control yourself. -Sir, I... Cool! This system is rotten. I agree. But even the remaining few sincere officers like you also go, it would totally die. It should not happen so. I know about that bloody Chalapati Rao. But if we do not save him now, public loses the smallest confidence having on us. Strength of terrorism would go up. Problem then would become bigger. No, do not spare them. Kill that Bulliraju and his entire group. Shoot them. -Sir! -There is no other way Prasad. No problem even if Chalapati Rao dies in that effort, I do not care. Kill them. Akashvani, local news by Mahankali Vijayakumar. Home Minister informed that Government is taking all actions to free Minister Chalapati Rao kidnapped by the terrorists. Their demand to release the terrorist named Bairagi and the abduction of minister Chalapati Rao is known to all the listeners. -Their demand to release Bairagi, -Please don't kill me. Time limit of 48 hours given by terrorists is getting out. Home Minister clarified that they cannot release the dreaded terrorist Bairagi as this would become a habit for terrorists. He said to be knowing how to get Minister released and would supress the terrorism strongly. Chief Minister in foreign tour condemning this act seriously has advised terrorists to leave their cruelty and get into public life. CM has warned that terrorists may have to face severe actions by not following this. -Here ends the local news. -I beg you, do not kill me. Sir, I have wife and kids. Do not kill me please. I will hand you over the 25 crores earned with the support of my father. Please do not kill me. I will not continue at all in politics. Please do not kill me. I will not be in this country and leave abroad. Do not kill me. [Gun cocks] [Music] Oh no, I am Chanti. Thank God. [Gasping] One after another is dying. What Balu said was correct. I feel frightened. Not that I will die. I am not understanding who is killing whom and for what here. I came here for Bulliraju. I will do anything for Bulliraju. But now, even Bulliraju is not correct. This will not match for us. I am thinking to leave from here. I know that you like me. Bairagi has said me. I am thinking to marry you. That too if you like it. You do not need to say immediately. If you like me and have confidence on me, it is enough if you put this necklace in your neck. It is like you agreed. I will immediately talk to Bulliraju. Think well. [Music] [Gun shot] Chanti! Police! [Gun fire] [Gun fire] -Chanti, no. Come back. -Lakshmi! [Music] Come on, run. [Gun fire] [Gun fire] Stay behind. [Gun fire] Bulliraju, come on hide. [Bomb blast] [Gun fire] Run away, come on. [Bomb blast] Come on! [Music] Tie him. [Gun cocking] [Gun shot] [Gun fire] Fire. -Chanti! -That fellow has killed Laxmi. Listen to me Chanti. [Gun fire] Damn! Bulliraju, there are many Police on the road. No, I am saying. [Gasping] Bulliraju, we do not have many rounds of bullets. What? Are the bullets over? Police! Fire! [Gun fire] -Balu! -Come on. -Run. -Move -Police! Save me. -Move! [Gun fire] -Bulliraju! -Sir! Stop or I will shoot. Stop! Bulliraju! Bulliraju! [Gun shot] Oh no! [Vehicle moving] Bulliraju! [Groaning] What happened, Bulli Raju? Come on, advance. Chanti, no! [Gun fire] No! Stop! Jump! [Blast] Oh! My leg! [Gun fire] Chanti! No! Chanti come back. [Splash] Chanti, listen to me. Chanti, come. Freeze! Stop there. Stop there, do not move. No, do not move. Bulliraju, do not move. [Guns cocking] Do not you dare to move! Bulliraju, do not move. Bulliraju, surrender. Surrender! That is enough. Enough of what happened. Enough of the violence. I am saying stop it. Surrender! [Gun fire] Hold your fire. Oh no! -Chanti! -Bulliraju! -Chanti! -Hold your fire. Bulliraju! [Groaning] Bulliraju! Bulliraju! Bulliraju! [Groaning and gasping] [Gasping] Bulliraju! Bulliraju! Bulliraju! Bulliraju! Bulliraju! Bulliraju! Bulliraju! Bulliraju! Bulliraju! [Weeping] [Music] [Silence] The End! When is the end for this killing spree? And where? "Leaving out the chance to write his own fate" "Electing fear within and the injustice as representatives" "Forgetting to question the breed feeling theirs as democracy" "Anger is it seems driving this blinded breed having eyes" "It seems the power orders saying to have that right" "This cruelty happening in the Kurukshtra war without Lord Krishna" "Is the decoration of the fire on corpses!" "Will you still sleep seeing this, my wide spread nation?" "Hey my widely spread nation!" "Shall we claim the ignorance of the half a century as independence," "Shall we do golden jubilee celebrations for the same?"
