David K dropped it in the sand. Sorry! What're you staring at? That surfer out there. He's pretty awesome. Man, lo-look, look at him! Did you see that bottom turn? Whoa. Check him out. Look, look, look. Look at that. Look at that! Man, that's sick. Yeah, he's alright. His board's big enough. Yeah, it's the length of his board that's doing all the ripping. The poor uncoordinated bastard is just along for the ride. Hey Willy? You had your daily allowance of kissing ass today? Yeah, you wish you were that good, Ran. - Dude whatever! - Check him out! Hey! Do you wanna go? Yeah. Alright, let's get out of here. That's supposed to make you surf better? No, it's supposed to keep me from looking like you. Bet you I'll be able to surf better than you in no time. And then you woke up. I'm joking man. You're gonna be a great surfer. You just gotta remember, it takes practice. Alright little bro. You better power up there, we got a big south swell coming. Eugh! If it isn't captain six pack. Hey! Your mom home? No, Ray. She's not. - When she coming back? - For you? Never. Fine. I can wait. Ray... To be completely honest, I don't think my mom really wants to see you. You don't think your mom... What's a punk kid like you know about what a woman wants? I think he should leave, Randy. You shut your trap, kid. Why don't you watch what you're doing?! - I'm sorry! - Why don't you take your hands off my brother? Get out of here! You're drunk! You're going home. That's it. You're done.

Get off my property, Ray. I've already told you once before. What? Go! Now! Screw you. Every last one of you. You come here again, I'm calling the police. You understand me? Shit! What the hell were you thinking? I can't believe you went out with that guy! What the hell were you thinking? You know very well, I never would've gotten involved had I known. I'm trying to get it all. Okay. It's okay. - I tried to get it all. - No, no, no. Don't worry. - Shhh. - I think I got all of it. - Let go, it's okay. - I'm sorry. It's not your fault. Look at me. Look at me. Skeet, look at me. Skeet, he's not gonna come back. He's not gonna hurt you. He's gone. He's gone. Okay? I swear to God, nothing is gonna happen to you. It's your birthday, little bro. You know what that means? It means tomorrow we're gonna get you a new board. Yeah, bro. It's gonna be so sick. You're gonna be a real surfer! Yo dude! Great, it's flat. Sure as hell isn't gonna happen here today. What the hell is this shit? Those people aren't locals. - They're Hawaiian guys. - Is that true, David K? - You must know them. - Hey, they're not Hawaiian! No way! Yeah well, it ain't saying much to be a local where the waves suck. Let's go to Secos, man. It's the south swell. $20 says it's gonna be bit chin' all morning. - You ready? - Yeah, let's go. You want to bounce to this? You wanna bounce to this? Check out that guy in the r- Hey! What the hell happened to our boards? What's it look like, retard? We've been ripped off! Shit! Look what happened to the tire! Hey, hey. Check this guy out. Man, look at this punk! What's he laughing about? Who that punk bitch? Alright, I'm gonna go over there and kick some ass. No, we're all gonna go. Skeet, you stay here. C'mon. But dude! I can't change a flat tire! Interesting story, our boards just got jacked. You see who did it? Nah. Yeah, we thought you might've seen something funny. Since you're having so much fun laughing at us. You think I know something about your boards, my man? I got nothing in my jeep, brotha. Why don't you take a look for yourself? Hey! We didn't say you took the surfboards. Brotha. Just thinking maybe you seen who did it, that's all. - What's up haole boy? - Haole boy? - You wanna go? - Whoa, whoa. What's up guys? - Hey. - Hey... Okay then. I'm Randy. Yeah, I know who you are.

Our boards just got jacked and I ask you a very simple question. Did you see who took them? What did I say? Dude, he's just asking you if you saw who took his boards? Get in the car, Samantha. - You want a ride, or what? - You gonna act like that? Then no. I don't think I do. In fact... Maybe I'll catch a ride with these guys instead. - Damn. What's up? - These guys? What's up? They ain't goin' nowheres with a flat tire? You know what, whatever. Just... excuse me. You know you did this shit. You know it. Dude, look at that! That's a sick tube, my brother. My God. Six-six tri-fin thruster. Are you kidding me? Dude I need this board. You see that, David K? Hey, Ran, guys! What you up to? Hey Rick! What's up man? Our boards got jacked today. - No shit! - Yeah bro. You know who did it? Yeah, these Hawaiian guys. They call themselves Da Cleanup Crew. Hey, I told you! They're not Hawaiians! Whatever, listen. We gotta get my little brother here a board. - He's the lucky one today. - Yeah? - Yeah! - Grasshopper, c'mon with me. Take care of him, Rick. Follow the old man, here. This your first board? - Um, no. - Yes! Yeah. Hey, make up my mind. Hey, that's the bugger we saw surf yesterday? Yeah man, same graphics. That's Jim Wesley, man. We saw him down at Secos, man. He was rippin' it! - Yeah. - How much coin you got? How much money did mom give you for your birthday? $100! A hundred bucks? That's it?! Well... Alright, I got... Sixty. Hey you guys! I need you to help chip in for my brother's first board. Hey, forget that, man! Come on man! When is the last time you chipped in for gas? That shit costs me, like, over $2 a gallon! Come on. It's his first board. Just give me like $20. Appreciate it man. I'll get you back. I swear. Willy, you got money man? - Willy! - What? Fine, bro. You got any cash? That's a cute wallet. Okay. $180... $190. I got $190, Ray. Well that's better than $100. Alright, let's see what we got. Alright... How about that one? Haha, that's a beaut, ain't it? But that's a little bit more than what you got, Randy. Don't want it. Doesn't have a sunrise on it. Man that board's way too big for Skeet. No it's not. What's up with the sunrise, punk? All the best surfer's have 'em! Look at that guy! Randy, man. This board's way too big for Skeet. What are you, a parrot? No it's not! When I was Skeet's age, I grew six inches! Besides, it's good for us to have a spare board on the big days. Comprende? That's $220. What? Rick, no. Come on, man. It's his first board. I got $190. No, no, no. Rick! Rick! - Rick! Come on! - Alright. Get it wet! Take it out of here. Alright! No, man, no. I don't want it, it doesn't have a sunrise! Do you want a surfboard or not? I do! But it has to have a sunrise on it! My gosh, you know what? You see this? Are you happy? How's that? Sunrise. You like that, don't you? Alright man. Congratulations! This is your first board! Alright, let's go! Let's get it wet! Rick, thank you very much, sir. $190. - Here, Randy. - No, your board. You carry it. Is it free-range chicken? - Sure, why not. - Yeah, they're, they're... They're treated very well. Randy? Yeah, actually... We're gonna... OK! We're closed, thanks. - Hey. - Hey! - Samantha, remember? - Yeah of course. How ya doing? We kind of met at the beach yesterday. So... Listen, I'm really sorry about what happened to your boards. - That sucks. - Yeah, me too. So... The Cro-Magnon man, was he your boyfriend? Who, Da Cat? No. No, I would say he's more along the lines of... I don't know. A free ride? - Free ride? - My car was in the shop. So he offered to give me a ride from the beach yesterday. Then starts hitting on me like I'm his girlfriend or something. No, he's... he's gross. So what kind of pussy name is Da Cat anyway? I mean, the guy's a kook. Well his real name is Victor. I wasn't sure yesterday but, I'm pretty sure now that... Victor and those guys took your boards. Yeah, we kind of figured that. I think I can help you get them back. What can I... What can I do? Tomorrow I'm meeting some friends at the beach. - Why don't you join us? - I'd love to. Tomorrow. Beach. Okay. - Alright, tomorrow. - I'll see you later. Thanks for stopping by. Grab it. - Got it! - Don't drop it. Alright, I need your help on something today. Yeah? I need to talk to Samantha about our boards. Which means you're gonna have to surf by yourself for a little while, okay? Which means, I want you to stay in the short break, and stay where the lifeguard can see you the whole entire time, okay? I don't want you drowning out there. I don't want mom killing me. - My God... - But.. But you're supposed to surf with me. Hey. My God. Woo! Let's go buddy. Look how hot she is. You're supposed to surf with me. What's up Randy? Hey... These are my friends, Nicole and Natalie. - Hi. - Hi! Ladies, this is my brother Skeet. Skeet! - Hi Skeet. - Hey Skeet... Hi! So you gonna go to your usual spot? The usual spot. Skeeter. Yeah. Yeah. My usual spot. Alright, man. I'll come get you when we're ready to go. See ya, ladies. Bye Skeet! - Bye Skeet. - Hey Skeet! - Yeah? - Don't lose that board! Man... God! Man. No! No! Pretty big out here for a grommit, like you. Get up. See where the water's swirling, right in here? - Yeah. - It's called a rip current. T's the first thing you look for o help you get outside. - Alright? - Yeah, okay. Grab your board. Follow me. Get your board! Okay, follow me. Pretty big board. - Got yourself a gun? - A gun? My brother picked it out. It weighs a ton. I'll bet. You be around here tomorrow? Yeah, I think so. Well then, if I were you, I'd leave that thing on the beach tonight. What do you mean? Someone'll steal it! Not if you hide it. See that lifeguard tower there? Right underneath the ramp. Dig yourself a hole after everybody's cleared out, drag that big ol' stick over to it, dump it in. It'll be there tomorrow. You nuts? I do it all the time. Don't worry about it. Nobody's gonna know where you hid it. Swear? Yeah! Yeah, okay. What's your name anyway? Jim Wesley. And grommit... Don't forget where you buried it. I won't! Sure hope not. Dude, I can't believe Skeet buried his board. Isn't that the most dumbass thing you ever heard? Actually man, all the old-timers used to do it. You know, actually, Miss Surfing Librarian, I don't give a shit. He's not an old-timer. Hey, you guys think they'll be here? Samantha said they come here. She said Da Cat's into this weird surf voodoo shit. Whoa. Hey you guys, check it out! - Let's go. - Let's go, stay low. Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Hey man, that's my board! Yeah! That ass has my board! Brotha! The honors. Alright, I'm going in. Stop! Hey wait! God, Willy! Dude, how many are there of us? How many? - Give me a number. - Yeah four. Okay, there's like 18 of them. Which means for each had four hands and went in at the same exact time, there'd still be two guys left over to kick our ass. It's not gonna happen tonight, okay? Alright, let's get outta here. Hey, do you think they already sacrificed my board? Yeah, to the Foot-Up-Your-Ass God. - Do you think maybe it'll help? - What?! I mean maybe we'll get a swell out of it. You sure this is the right tower? Yes I'm sure. Wow, cool! Look! What the hell happened to your board? Ho!! You were visited by the board fairies! - Skeet! - Yeah! I'm stoked for you, brother. I'm keepin' it! Check out the fins! What if it's somebody else's board, Bluebeard? Nah. It ain't. He wanted me to have it. He wanted you to have it? - Yeah. - Who the hell is he? You don't know him, squid-dick. He's a real surfer! A real surfer... Alright man. I'm keepin' it! That's for dang sure! M not kidding man. Don't let e little grom out of your sight. No worries bro, I get him. Alright. - Meet back up at Willy's? - See you then. Don't go above 55, and, you know the brakes still don't really work, so. Okay so drive 70 and ride the brakes? Exactly. - Yeah, okay. - See you at Willy's. - Later man. Nice work, little bro. Yeah, dad I know. Yeah, I was thinking about trade school. No I didn't! I swear! Look, I'll try to do better. Pop? Yeah, ever since he and my mom split up, he's been on my ass. Thinks I'm screwing around too much, she's too soft on me... I really don't give a shit. - Send me that. - Yeah. Shit, hey! Check the window! Go check the window. I don't want my mom coming in here to find us like this. It's just, David K and Skeet. Who's the beach bum? I don't know! Hey, forget the beach bum man. Check out Randy! Shit, I like that, man. It's not fair, man. It's just not fair. How are you, Dobson? You're supposed to ride with Zack. Who's that? A friend. A friend? Yeah, Zack had to leave. See ya! Skeet, I'm not kidding, who is that guy? Just a friend! - Just a friend? What friend? - Hey man. Forget about his friend. Who the hell was your friend? Skeet, who is he? Skeet! Who is he? Hey come on, Dobson. She got any sisters? It's that girl, Samantha. We met at the beach, remember? - The chick with Da Cat? - Not anymore, alright. She's invited us all to a party next weekend at her friend Natalie's house. Maybe you get lucky, probably you won't. Buttmunch! What's his name? - Can I go too? - No, c'mon. Tell me his name. Jim Wesley. He surfs, alright? Jim Wesley. He surfs. This the guy that gave you the board? Who the hell is Jim Wesley? Hey, come on Ran. Don't have a heat up, bro. Listen, you remember that surfer we saw at Secos? Yeah. And the bugger on the poster at Rick's shop? - That's Jim Wesley, brother. - How come I never heard of him? What? You must be joking, Ran. Come on. Shoot, he's a classic. Hey Willy! You still got that old surf tape I lent you? Wesley is the main man in that. Come on, plug it in! I'll show you right now. Okay. Yeah. Is that Jim Wesley? Hey, you guys remember that story about Waimea Bay? It's like... seven years ago. It was 40 feet plus, and they say it was just unridable right? Well, some bugger paddled out there on a borrowed board and just tore it up! After that, he just disappeared. I heard he went to jail. No way! What for? For kicking the shit out of Waimea Bay. And you just met this guy... What the hell are you doing, man? Don't give that shit to my brother! Don't you dare give that shit to my brother! Any of you! And you! - I just bought that bong! - I don't give a shit, Willy. - Alright, if I catch yo... You're not my dad, or my boss! No, I'm not dad. Alright, I'm your brother. But it's teamwork, remember? We're supposed to look out for each other! Yo-you're You're 12 years old, for Christ's sake! Skeeter... Let's go. Come on. Let's go! Come on. Randy, I'm sorry man. Just... Hello. Hi! I'm, Jim Wesley. Hi Jim Wesley. Jessica. Come on in. Um, thank you for calling to introduce yourself last night, I appreciate it. Skeet is so excited about surfing with you. It's all he talks about. Yeah good. I just, saw how much he wanted to surf. Thought I'd... try to get him off on the right foot. So is it Captain Jim, or... just Jim? Skeet told me he was only doing what pirates have always done. Bury their treasure. It was you who got him to bury his surfboard, right? Yeah. Yeah, I wasn't trying to get him in any trouble. It's okay. Actually he says the new board you got him fits him better. So thank you. I'll go get him. Hey squirt! Hey. You got my brother's board? Yeah. I'm Jim Wesley. Yeah, I know who you are. When do we get it back? Anytime. He should have a board he can manage. The one I gave him is brand new. Yeah, well I picked the other one out for him especially so I'd like to get it back. Sure. Okay. Is that you? Yeah... I made Surfer Magazine last year. You see that one right there? That's my dad. He was a cop. He died a hero. So what about you? See there's a rumor going around here that you spent some time in jail. Is that true? Was never in jail. Hey Jim! Ready to go surfing? - Yeah, let's get out of here. - Let's go! Do you have everything you need? Yes! Mom, I don't think this is a good idea. - Why? - I just don't think it is. Why? I'm going surfing, plus, you have to work. Jim said he'll take me. It's okay. They're going to Zuma. Danny'll be there. What time you want him back? - Five. - Three! I'll pick him up at three. See you at three. Bye mom. See you later, Randy. Careful with that thing! Thanks Jim! Bye! See ya mom! Mom, I don't think this is a good idea. Okay, let me get this straight... All summer long you've been dying to ditch your kid brother, and finally when somebody comes along who wants to teach him how to surf, You change your tune to "I don't think this is a good idea." Because it's not. Look, I'm glad you're concerned. I just... wonder what it is you're concerned about. Randy thinks he runs the place since my dad was killed. Sorry about that. That's alright. I have a brother. You get beat up? Actually, I'm the oldest. I did the beatin'! Sorry about your dad. Yeah. You married? Was. And I had a daughter. So you're divorced? Nope. You mean they died? You don't have to talk about it. Party on! Alright man. You're coming to this party because you're my little brother. But if mom finds out, You'll be my dead little brother, comprende? Stop looking at her butt. Come on. What's up, player? All kinds of people at this party, man. How's it going, brother? Where's Willy at, man? Drunk. Probably around the bonfire, acting funky. Maybe he's picking up ladies, not like you two losers. - Hey! - Hey! Randy, we gotta talk, man. Jesus Christ, man. What are you doing? My mom found my stash, she gave it to my dad. He went ballistic. He said when he gets back from his business trip I gotta join the marines and straighten my shit out or he's gonna turn me in to the police. He's not gonna turn you in to the police. That's bullshit, man. He's a nazi. You know it! Last summer when I got busted, what did he say? - I know what he said! I messed up again man! The cops, or the marines. That's terrible man. He's not gonna go to the cops. I promise you. But what if he does, man? What if he does? You know, I lose the summer... My friends... - You know, the surf? - What're you talking about? That's pretty shitty man. You know, that's pretty shitty. Willy wait! Stop! Willy! - He's not... Willy! - Hey I'll work it out, okay? Willy! Hey, the little bugger wants to get ripped? Hey... Little man. Your mommy know you up so late, brother? I was invited, unlike you losers. Hey! Paws off my hat, squid-dick! Paws off my hat, squid-dick! Randy! - Randy! - Now you done done it, bro. Let's get him! Randy! Look out! Help me! Randy! Randy, star the car! - Start the car now. - The hell are you doing? - Skeet! Skeet! - Start the car! What are yo- Open the door! Come on, let's get out of here. This is such bullshit. Where you going? Where you going? We'll get you Skeeter! Skeeter! Come on! Don't do this! - You wanna do this, punk? - What? Tell me something. What kinda bitch picks on a 12 year old? - I want you. - Please don't do this. These guys are nuts! What's up Samantha? You thinking this haole boy is better than me, or some? Forget that shit. You know yo- You the prick that killed my board? - You're the pricks? - I would be that prick. Come on, shit eater! Hold on there. We got a call about a disturbance. That wouldn't be you boys, would it? No, my boyfriend and I, we got a flat tire down here... These gentlemen here were nice enough to give us a hand. Ain't that right? Gentlemen? What's your story? You heard the man officer. We was just trying to help fix the flat. I bet you were. Alright! Party's over. Let's go! Let's go! Today people. Party's over. Come on, let's go. What do you say we finish this another time? - Come on folks, party's over. - I'll count the seconds. Until then. Good seeing ya. - Yeah, next time brother. Woo! Hey, Skeet! Little brother, we go now? Hey come on, Skeet. Unlock the door, man. Zack, stop man! Stop! What the hell are you doing man? This is serious shit from my brother. You know how he gets sometimes. Man, he flips out. Just chill. Let me handle this. Jesus. Skeet, unlock the door, man. Alright? Skeet, you gotta unlock the door, alright? We're safe. We chased those guys off. They're gone. They're not gonna hurt you, I promise you that. I need to take you home, but you need to unlock the door. Skeet, come on, please. Open the door. Skeet. Skeet, look at me. Okay, you're fine. Look at me. Look, Samantha's fine. I'm fine, David K's fine. We just wanna go home. I'm gonna take you to your room, I'll even camp out there tonight. We'll camp out in the tent with the flashlights, man. You alright? It's alright, alright? Don't worry about 'em. Okay, don't worry about 'em. You want to go home? Alright. We'll get out of here. What's up, fellas? How you doin' Skeeter? Hey, you guys. - Hey Jim! - What's up Jim? I've been getting some decent rides up that sandbar peak. That's... great. We'll catch up with you, Jim. Come on, Skeet. Alright, let's go! Hey Randy! Check out the cut-back I can do! Your brother's getting pretty good. Who the hell does that guy think he is? I guess it's not the length of the board that matters, Ran? The hell is he doing? I don't know, it's disrespect though, man. Decent little swell. Not being cool, man. What the hell? That's how you need to try to catch the wave. And as I try to catch it... I'm almost on it, I'm almost there! And now Jump on it! Now I'm riding.. The whole of the wave, right? Turning a little bit. Okay... balancing. See? So what do you call that? I was up first surfing... Like if balance is wrong... Hey Randy, did you see me surf today? Nice to see you too. I think I better get out of here. Why don't you save some of those moves for the waves, Skeet? - Okay. Jim! Jim, how about... staying for dinner? I think, Randy needs a little space. Hey Jessica... Why don't you come out with me instead? Come on! Let's get outta here! Give you a chance to... check out the guy's been hanging out with your kid. Okay. About an hour? Great. When I went down, and was under the roll of the wave, a dolphin came up right next to me, and it goes: - Then I wiped out. - I don't believe you. - You going somewhere? - Out to dinner. With who? With Jim? There are leftovers in the fridge. Mom... I don't want you going out with him. Alright... Talk to me. What's the problem? He's a nice guy. I like him! I just don't want him hanging around here! Well it's not for you to say who I can see. Mom! You don't know anything about him, alright? All you know is what Skeet tells you, right, and I've heard some sketchy shit about this guy. Jim isn't even close. No one's trying to replace your father, Randy. Leave her alone, Randy! If she wants to go out with Jim, let her go out with Jim! - Skeet, shut up! - Hey! No, mom. Every single one of them has been a loser, - and you know this. - M-Mike! Right? They've all been losers. You know this! Enough! Conversation over. You're just jealous because Jim can surf better than you! Skeet shut up! I swear, sometimes I wish you weren't even my little brother! He didn't mean that. Skeet. No, honey, he.. he... - He's not mad at you! - No! He's just mad at the world. I haven't been here in years. No? Me neither. Skeet would love this tank. That fish looks familiar. Hey! Jim Wesley! My brother from another mother! - Craig Kealoha! - How are ya? - Good to see you, man. - How is it? Craig Kealoha, this is Jessica. I've known this guy since I was Skeet's age. - Wow! - Pleasure Jessica. Nice to meet you. Good. Hey brother, you've gotta see what we did in the bar. C'mon, I'll show ya. How long you been here, Craig? About five years now. It's going pretty good, too. Check it out. - My God! - Wow... That's what we call Da Kine, brother. Is that you? I mean, I can't believe you're still alive! Hey, he's a bonafide surfing god. Look up there! Your dad gave it to me a few years ago. That's the board Jimmy won the world title on at the Makaha site. Craig, is someone paying you to say all this? I am very impressed. Sir, your table is ready. Thanks. I'll let the two of you get back to your dinner. You ever get any time off at the garage? Ooh, I'd love to get back in the water with you again? It's been too long, my friend. Yeah. I owe ya. - Jessica, it's been a pleasure. - Nice to meet you. Thank you. Make sure this reluctant Kahuna here gives me a call. I heard it on the news. A police officer was killed serving a warrant. I never thought it'd be Daryl. God, it was so hard on the boys.. For Randy, the weight of the world was suddenly on his shoulders. I mean... The day Daryl died, he felt he needed to be the man of the house. Responsible for us. Especially Skeet. And Skeet... He was so much younger. I don't even really... know how much he understood. But when he finally got it, that Daddy was never coming home... things started frightening him. The doctor's call it an anxiety disorder. They say he'll probably outgrow it. I hope he does. I think it was rough on you... I was a mess. But I didn't have much of a choice. I had to keep it together for the boys. If I didn't have them, I don't know what I would have done. Diane. My wife's name was Diane. We met on the north shore of Oahu. She was pregnant when we got married. But it didn't matter. The timing was perfect. Started... working full time in my dad's garage. Molly was born. Life was great. They were killed in a car accident. I didn't handle it well. I couldn't believe they were gone. I thought... I should be able to protect them. I still think that. Anyway... I took off, grabbed my board... just left. For almost two years. Then I came back. And now? I go to work. Every day. And I surf. I don't know, man. I still don't think your dad's going to turn you in. Yeah, but I can't take the chance. Listen man, I'm thinking about going to community college. Wanna roll with me? We could do it together? That's gonna make your dad happy, right? No, school is worse than the cops, man. I think I'm gonna split for a little bit, you know? Go to Costa Rica, or... do Europe. Get a job on a ship, or... just play the bongos for spare change. How you gonna get to Costa Rica man? You don't have any money! I'm gonna borrow it from you. From me, right? I got enough to get about to Mexico. Yeah, Mexico. That's it, man. What's it? Well let's do Mexico as like a final surf adventure. I heard of this little place that's north of K-38. A little trail that goes to this amazing point break. Alright, so we get down there and some mexican rancher chases us off with a shotgun, you're gonna be happy? Man, I got a little secret map that I paid five bucks for. A secret map that you got for five bucks? - Hey have a little faith! - I'm having faith, man. Alright, Mexico it is. I'm down, man. What's on your mind? Nothin'. Hey Jim? I was wondering... What do you think about my mom? I think you're a lucky guy. Yeah. She likes you. A lot. I can tell. Let's give her a try? What year is this? 1940 Standard. 1940? Ford. Why do they call it a woodie? What are you, nuts? Hey Jim? I was wondering... If things don't work out between, you know, you and my mom... We're always gonna be friends, right? Yeah! No matter what? Yeah! Swear? No matter what. Okay, coffee's on me tomorrow... - Great. Bye! - I'll see you later. Thanks, Cath. Hey! - Hey mom! - Hi Jim! Listen, Randy and his friends are gonna go to Mexico to go surfing. And they said I can go with 'em! We're gonna camp out on the beach! - Can I go? - Since when is Randy going to Mexico? Mom... These are Willy's last few days as a free man! They said I can go. Can I? It's just for one night. - Please? - Let's talk to your brother. Hey Randy! Okay, what's this about Mexico? - Don't worry, it's off.- - What?! Why? Cause this sled is about done, it won't even turn over. But what about Willy? Skeet, I know. What am I supposed to do? Check the battery? Yeah, Jim. I checked the battery. I'll call a friend of mine with a tow truck. Follow me down to the shop, we can get this up in the air, and see if we can't see what's up. I don't think so. Randy... Why not? Your mom is gonna bring this down to my garage anyway. Why don't we do it now? See if we can't get you guys back on the road. Do it, Randy. Are you serious? Yeah. - Can I use your phone? - Sure. Hey mom, if they get the car running, can I go with 'em? Mom, it's my job to watch Randy, anyway. Aw, Skeet, I don't know. - Mom... - Mom, it's Mexico. It's like two and half hours. I'll take good care of him. Plus I got this sick new move I'm gonna teach him. Yeah, he's got a new move he wants to teach me! A new move? Please?! You better keep your eye on him! Alright! And only if Jim says this is safe to drive. - And no drinking. - Hold the wrench. Mexico baby! You stoked? You getting ready? You down? Here... That's your problem. Why don't you get it off the rack. I'll go get us something to drink. You're pretty good with a wrench. Yeah, my dad used to work on cars. Guess it kind of just rubbed off. You want water, or... water? I think I'll go with water. My dad used to collect all that stuff. Always said that the customer's loved it. Did they? I don't know. Sure ain't a lot of business. My God, dude. Is this you? Dude that is the biggest wave I have ever seen, man. I mean, where do you go from there? That's the pinnacle right? Truth is... the waves I catch tomorrow or the next day, mean a lot more to me than anything I did back then. Come on man, a surf star traveling the world? It doesn't get better than that! Travel was cool. People were great. Problem was, I spent so much time trying to be... whoever that guy is right there... I forgot why I loved surfing in the first place. I'm much more in tune with things the way they are now. Back then I was trying to prove something. Not anymore. That's kind of where I'm at right now, you know. My friends all think I should go pro, my mom wants me to go to college. Randy! What do you want? Well that's whole thing, man. I don't know. I guess I'm still trying to just figure it out. Give it time. It'll come. Who are all these guys? The old Malibu surf group. - Ever hear of Phil Edwards? - Yeah! That's him on the left. - No shit! - Johnny Fain, Mike Doyle. Johnny Riddle, and myself. A lifetime ago. That's cool man. That's cool. A question for you. Yeah, fine. Bring me the rag, will ya? When you first started surfing, were there guys that thought that they owned the waves? You know, like certain breaks. Who rip other surfers off, and shit. I mean when did all the dick heads pop up? Dick heads have been here since the beginning of time. But nobody, and I mean nobody... owns the waves. And if someone did think they owned a break, we showed them they didn't. In our own way, we showed 'em they didn't. You're the locals here. Use your edge. So listen, I get... paid on Friday for th- - No charge. Forget about it. Reminds me of something. Wait, are you sure? Yep! I'm sure. I don't charge friends. Now... This is still too big for your brother. But you might want to take it to Mexico with ya because if the surf is big you'll be glad you had it. Might bring out the soulfulness in your surfing. Listen, there's this, BBQ I'm having next Saturday. It's gonna be me, my mom, brother, friends... Catch some waves, eat some food. - You think you... - Sure! - Yeah? - Yeah. Bitchin' man. I'll count on you then. Appreciate this. Anytime. Keep an eye on my mom for me, alright? I'll get the door. Skeet, there's probably something I should tell ya. What? We're not going to Mexico? We're going to Mexico. But you gotta be 18 to cross the border. Which means we're gonna have to hide you. Okay. Squid-dicks! I swear! That's bad language, son! How much are these? Yo Randy, check this out! You could surf down this. Hey... This some real hamajang shit here, Willy. - Okay brother? - Yeah, I'm alright. Do you even know where we're at man? Real hot trail here, William. Do you have any idea where we are? This is bad for my stick. Shit! You rejects done yet? We're hitting the water. You taking a nap? Your brother's getting kind of scary, Randy. Woo! One, two... What the hell?! Ma-Make us dinner, man. Yee-hoo! Woo! Yeah, man. To William Tanner, the best damn friend a guy could have! Surfer, adventurer extraordinaire, and the "secret spot" guy. Guys, guys, shouldn't I have a beer for this? - No! - No... Hey, to Willy Tanner, man. You're gonna be one hell of a jarhead, brother. Hey guys... I was thinking... Should we name this place after Willy? That's a good idea little brother. Which do you guys like better... Tanner's Secret Surf Spot... Or... - Willy's? - Willy's! Willy's rocks. - Willy's! Willy's! We're doing some tequila shots! I got it, I got it. Hey! Hold on, hey. Ho ho! Ho ho! Merry Christmas! Yeah! Ready? Ready! Woo-hoo! Yeah! Bottom of the ninth, Dobson is up to bat! Big Zack Daddy's pitching it off, baby! And we go! Woo! Maybe we should close the doors. Nah. They're just having a little fun. They can't see us anyway. Yeah! Woo! My God! - Shit! Randy, Randy. Here they come. Here they come Randy. Don't say anything. Let me handle this. You must think that's pretty damn funny, don't you? No, I don't. It was an accident, man. It was an accident man. I swear to God, we did not mean to do that. We were just lighting off some rockets when one accidentally went into your tr- - Hey whoa! - Whoa, whoa! You come into a man's campsite screaming stuff, and accusing us with a bat? You want to do something? - Stop, stop! - Hey, hey, hey. Chill man. You're acting like your old man. Just chill. Dude! Willy! What are you doing, man? It's not worth it! You're acting like your old man! Stop it! Forget these guys, they're nothing. Just go, bro. Let me handle this. Let me handle this. Just go. Skeet, go with him. No, I want to stay here with you. Skeet, I want you to go with him. - I wanna stay with you Randy! - Stay with Willy. Stay with Willy, go. Go. Stay with Willy. How about a drink? I'm sorry, bro. He's... He's drunk, he's an idiot. Don't worry about it, alright? We're all cool here. C'mon, let's get those beers. Here you go man. Sorry, buddy. Just like my old man? "The marines will make a man out of your weak, dope-smoking ass yet!" He wants to push me? Well then keep pushing me! And see what happens when you push me! - Willy! - Don't do it. What are you doing man? What are you... Don't do this! You leave me alone! Willy... hey... Hey brother, don't do this. - What does it matter, man? - What's it matter? It matters to my brother, it matters to all of us. - You know this. - No, that's bullshit. Hey brother... I'd feel a lot better if you'd step away from there. Come on now, Willy. It's not that kind of party. Yeah, it's a party, man. The party's over for me, okay? No, Willy. Alright? Just come away from there. Tanner... Tanner... You don't want to do this, man. You don't want to do this. Randy, you don't know what it's like to have a dad that hates you! Then tell me. We're all listening. Tell us now! If it was up to him, man, he's gonna have me rolling around in mud at Pendleton! You know? And when I get back it ain't gonna be the same. Wait, wait... Did you... Did you just say Pendleton? Yeah. Dude, Pendleton is off limits to surfers. I feel shitloads better. No, no, no. You don't get it. Civilian surfers. Not marines, alright? You know what that means? That means you have one of the sickest breaks along the whole west coast, all to yourself. I kid you not. - Dude, Willy. - Awesome, man. Trust me, all to yourself. You're never gonna want to come back. Ever, man! All to yourself, dude. - Come on. - Surf bros forever? Come here. Yeah. Woo! Woo! That's you, Willy. That's you baby! Why aren't you paddling out with Willy? I don't know. Just think he deserves it to himself. Good man, Dobson. You know I love you, right? Yeah? Yep. - Check it out! - Hey squirt! Hey mom! Thanks. - Hi. - Hi! Hey mom. Hey Jim, you want to paddle out? Go ahead, I'll catch up to you. Alright. Come on, Jim. There's a sweet surf out there. Go on! Woo hoo! One, two, three! Yeah! Take it! Now you're a part of Willy's Secret Surf Club. Now you're one of us, man. Right here, right here! You're going down. Yeah!! Wait! Wait! I got it, I got it. No, no, no, no! Alright, go, go, go! Yeah baby! Skeet! What are you doing? What are you doing?! You're out too far. You're out too far! Hey! Hey, what are you doing way out here? Nothing. Just practicing on my board! You're way past the line. It's the south swell, you're in a rip tide! It's taking you out to sea. Paddle in. - Why? - I know what I'm talking about, Skeet. Paddle in! You didn't have to go out there. I mean, I know how to surf! Jeez, I was safer than a dog. Man! What happened? I thought he was in trouble. I overreacted. It's okay. Come on, let's go home. You coming? I think I'll stick around. Will I see you later? Hey Jim? What time are we going surfing tomorrow? What's up with Jim, mom? It's just been a long day, honey. Hey bro? Why don't you come with me, man? I'm gonna go pick up the guys, we're gonna go catch some waves... Surf's supposed to be cranking, man. It'll be fun. Besides, Willy takes off here in about a week. - No. - No... It's been almost a month, man. You sure you don't want to go? - Come on, let's go buddy. - No! Skeet. It's dinged now man. You're gonna have to fix it. Give it to me. Hey. I think we need to talk. I understand why you'd be disappointed that Jim hasn't been coming around. But please, honey. Don't be angry with him. Where is he? Why doesn't he call? Something bad happened between you guys, didn't it? Didn't it? - Something always happens! - No. Nothing happened, honey. Do you know what your father used to say? He said that sometimes when people are hurting, they don't know how to ask for help. And that's why it's really important for friends to be patient, and to reach out to them. And I think he'd say right now... Jim needs your help. No! He told me that no matter what happens we'd be friends! What's difficult for him is you and Randy! Where's Skeet? In his room. So no Jim? No... So leave him alone right now, okay? No calls, no show, no nothing from him for a month, he just flakes! That's exactly what Skeet doesn't need to hear right now. Well, I warned you. He just took a little longer than the rest of them. It's the same routine. He comes over here and gets Skeet all pumped up on his pure surfing bullshit? Then he tries to pick up on you. What? Did you go to bed with him? That's enough. You know what, tomorrow I'm going down to this grease monkey's pit, and letting him know what I think about his little disappearing act! - You will do no such thing! I won't let you! So now it's him over us? That is great! That is great! That's bullshit! Hey mom... I'm going out surfing, alright? You alright? Yeah, I know. I'll be home by sunset. Okay. Bye. Bye! Yeah? Come in. Hey Jim. Was that you at the beach? Yeah. Yeah. I wanted to see what a real surfer looked like. Why didn't you paddle out? I haven't been in the water much lately. How come? Tell me. Three years ago... my.... My wife and my daughter died. This is for you. Randy told me you had a lot of old pictures in your office. So I... thought you might like a newer one to add in to the rest of them. That was the best day I had all summer. Hope you like it. How's your mom? She's alright. How's your brother? He's... he's mad all the time. Well, I should go. Hey Jim? When you're ready to surf... I'm ready too. What the hell do you think you're doing? Hey Randy. Thought I'd... come by and talk. Talk? What, like talk your way back into my house? Talk your way back into my family? I don't think so. - How you been, Ran? - Jim, I think you should leave. Give me a chance. Chance? No, you had your chance, Jim. You had your chance and you blew it. You came over here, you acted like you were friends with my brother. You acted like you loved mom, I want you gone Jim! I want you gone! I'm serious Jim! I want you gone! Jim! Back up! Now I want you gone. I told you. I told you... Like three times! Jim! I want you gone! Do not mess with me, and do not mess with my family! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it... I'm sorry. Don't... leave. I'm doing the best I can, Randy. Stop it. I'm sorry... I'm sorry. You don't understand... No.... I'm sorry... It's okay... Hey Scotty! How goes it? Hey Jim! Long time no see. Got a minute? Grab a cup of coffee? Got a great story for ya. Sure. What do you think? - 13.5 tail. - Right. The rails, what are they? Two and five-eighths. Here, feel how light it is. - Nice board. - Yeah, it's a beauty. Gentlemen Please come ashore. What's this shit, brothers? - Please come ashore. - What do they want us for? We would like to have a word with you, and that means now. Awoo! Come on. Bring your surfboards in. Let's go! Please come ashore. We'd like to have a word with you. Bring it in. Gentlemen, I'm afraid we're gonna need to see some I.D. It's in my pants, bugger. My grip's right over there. Alright, well drop your boards and go grab it. Come on. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Bad picture, cuz. Feel sorry for you. Why you busting our balls man? Hey! You're surfing in a swim only zone, man. So we're gonna confiscate your boards... write up some tickets, and when you pay the fine, you get your boards back. That's how it works, man. Alright? You guys ain't got nothing better to do here, bro? What we do sir, is keep this beach safe for everybody. You understand, bro? Probably have to run a check on these boards here. Cause there's been a... A lot of surfboard thefts around here lately, and I'd be pretty damn interested to see if these come up hot, wouldn't you? Thanks to Victor here, and his little speech impediment, you've all just won a dream date with the LAPD! Cuff 'em! Do not make this any more painful than it has to be. It's not right, man. Get moving shit eater. Right in here... Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave the facility. Shit, no. Alright, line up at the urinals. What?! Now stand still! This is complete bullshit, man! You messin' with Da Cleanup Crew! The Cleanup Crew? Do you have any idea how gay that sounds, chief? Do you have any idea? What's that supposed to mean, man? I'm thinking maybe we got us a lawsuit here, brothers? I don't think you got a lawsuit. Aaah! You think they got a lawsuit? No lawsuit! You're a pothead, aren't you? No, bro! You're not? Well I think you are. I think you're the worst kind of pothead. The kind that doesn't share! What do we do to potheads who don't share? Bullshit man! You guys ain't real lifeguards! Hey, bugger! You ain't no real Hawaiian, bro! Hey, surfers, pass the word! This what it means to be part of Da Cleanup Crew! You picked the wrong board to steal, shit eater! Great. Thanks man. Anytime brother. Whatever you need. Big sign? Woo! Hey mom, hey Jim! - Hi honey. - You guys put everything back? Yep! Right back in the jeeps where we found them. Thanks for the help, man. - Everything? - Everything. So the surf's up, man. Want to catch some waves? Nah. You guys go ahead. I'm catching up. Alright. - Thanks. - Come on, Jim. Go! Go, Skeet go! - Skeeter! - Yo! Woo hoo!
