Yesterday, September 15, 1974, a young man has arrived. Like me before him, he came alone. They had said: "We will come back and get you. "However long it takes, "we will come back." When the acacia flowers fall After crossing mountains and rivers we will be in Changchun Now that there are no more bandits The sun sets on the snow My sword is crying The troops advance in the desert of sand Even though our caps are freezing On the front line for the Fatherland We have struggled so far... I'll be back. When the acacia flowers fall After crossing mountains and rivers we will be in Changchun Now that there are no more bandits The sun sets on the snow My sword is crying The troops advance in the desert of sand Even though our caps are freezing On the front line for the Fatherland We have struggled so far And we will fight until the end of winter Bye The troops advance in the desert of sand Even though our caps are freezing On the front line for the Fatherland We have struggled so far... Go on. It's finish... Put me in jail. What is finished? You wanted to be a pilot, right? This song that you sang, did you learn it in the houses of pleasure? Don't be embarrassed! It's not like I don't know that kind of fun with girls. Have you never known a woman? It's not a good time to think about girls anyway. Go on, tell me. I started the officers' school to be a pilot. They said I won't be a pilot. Because I am dizzy. But, they said there is a way. They put in just enough gasoline to get to the American ships. Not to come back. They said they would give me something that takes away the vertigo, and even the fear. But you couldn't, eh? Why? Onoda. Look at me. I am Major Taniguchi Yoshimi. Have you ever heard of Nakano School's Futamata annex? You won't be a pilot. But there are other ways to be proud. Do you know why you didn't get on the plane? Because you don't want to die. Do you refuse to drink with your father? I don't drink anymore. You? Where are you assigned? I do not know yet. How so? You necessarily have an idea. Your brother is on good terms with the general staff. - He could... - No, thank you. Your body is the Fatherland. Don't leave it to the enemy. If you are taken prisoner, use it to end your life. Are you ready to give your life for the Emperor? Tell me. 4.30 p.m.: arrival in Lubang. Greeted by Captain Hayakawa. The Americans took Luzon. They are approaching. Their attack will be massive. The aerodrome must be destroyed as soon as possible. Then the port facilities in Vigo, Tilik and Looc. Another emergency: stockpile food and ammunition in the mountains. Gentlemen, thank you. Wait, we have to... We heard you. Gentlemen. Kamikaze Ship Squad, Lieutenant Suehiro. Lieutenant Onoda. Your instructions cannot be followed. These are orders. This is not the way to repel the enemy. As soon as the enemy fleet is in sight, my squad will take action. I was sent here to prepare for an autonomous resistance. I must lead the garrison in this perspective. "Direct" yes, not "Command". Captain Hayakawa is in command. No matter. The staff has decided on a new strategy: guerrilla warfare! I have official orders. Our forces will soon regain control of the skies. Your inexperience serves you. Good! Drink a little, we leave. The men want to rest here, to spend the night. There are some who are sick. Listen. I do not know what we have accustomed you to, but time is no longer idle. Let's go! How dare you act behind my back? You've exhausted these men! What else do you want from them? What is happening? The airfield must not fall into enemy hands. - I'm carrying out my orders. - Enough! I take these men away from you! I will find others. Captain! Clear the way! Ask it! It's a crisis of calculations. He will suffer until the stone is expelled. Excuse me. The mayor of Lubang is there. Make him go. Captain Hayakawa. Let me order. - Dirty Donkos! - the enemy is approaching. He says our men have stolen coffee and rice from his peasants. Stop it! Donkos' crap! Always there to complain! Go home, pray that the Bittersweet land! There are no thieves in my garrison! Take it out! Clear! Hand over the command to me. It will be better from tomorrow morning. It's in Tilik! The Americans are in Tilik! What is happening? Who told you to do this? Take it back! Where is the Second Kuroda? - Calm down! - Lieutenant! The coffee is gone! He was there yesterday! Let go of me! It's a flight! It's a flight! Lieutenant! We must find him! A stretcher for the Captain! Captain Hayakawa! We must join the Radar Squad at Camp 900! The Captain will... Kozuka. Why is it called the "Camp 900"? This mountain is 900 meters high. Lieutenant Suehiro... What happened? Where are your men? The enemy ships were barely 200 meters away. We had hidden our boats loaded with explosives. Corn... When we started to board, they took us by surprise. All my men. Corn... were you good with them? Are you questioning my word? I jumped into the sea and swam. What else do you know? Did you see the Radar Squad when you got here? They were all killed in Tilik. There were only charred bodies. The Americans are already inland. Here, there are only the sick. In a tent over there. What do you have? We do not know. Maybe typhus. The enemy is on the way. We take you with us. Please, let us kill ourselves here. What is going on? - I killed an American sentry. - Where? One kilometer away. You don't have to stay here. Lieutenant. We will await the arrival of the enemies. We will take them with us. What is that? It's "Chewing Gum". It's still soft. Lieutenant, what do we do now? You know, some haven't eaten for more than two days. The situation is too uncertain. First of all, we will have to reorganize. We go to the food cache. We have to assess how long we can hold out. - Where do you get rice from? - Let go of me! Stop whining! I saw it! He took it back! Never again. If the enemy attacked during meals, we would be dead in two minutes. To avoid annihilation, I propose to split into two rations. Uh... in two sections. The men agree with me. He is no longer fit for combat. If it is, he even wants to surrender. You have to be wary of him. And also the soldiers who are under his influence. They behave like pigs. Let's choose the strongest men. He can keep the rest. Shimada. He speaks little, but he is strong and determined. Akatsu will follow Shimada everywhere. And those? They're still stuffed together. Oshima, Sakamoto and Sato. The "Mito Triplets". We're going to split into two groups. It's the best solution. - Kozuka. - Yes. Shimada. Akatsu. Oshima, Sakamoto and Sato, you will be part of my unit. The rest go with Lt. Suehiro. Take two bags of rice and go for it now. Go on! We break up! Good! Listen to me carefully. I chose you because you still stand like men. A Japanese soldier does not obey his stomach! With what is stored here, we can easily last several months. Do you think there are still a lot of Japanese soldiers? We will find out quickly. But anyway, that doesn't change our goal. What objective? Total resistance! Harass the Americans with our attacks. Recover control of the land by the guerrillas. We must continue to sing our songs! Lieutenant. The Mito Triplets are gone. Lieutenant. The Mito Triplets are gone. What do we do? They fled. Can we catch up with them? No. Leave them. We have more to do. What's wrong with him? A cold snap. It will pass. Good. The enemy has landed there. This is the best place to set up your base. We will make sure and decide on an action. Four, well organized, we can kill hundreds of men. We are here. You have to go back up on this mountain side. From there, we will have a dominant view. Corn... with rain like that, it's dangerous. There are torrents of mud. It quickly becomes impossible to locate. At the first lull, we go. The troops advance in the desert of sand Even though our caps are freezing On the front line for the Fatherland We have struggled so far Looks like the fishing was good! I found plenty of them. What is that? Bring me the machete. It's enormous! It's called "gonchis". Did you see something? - Did you hear any shots? - No nothing at all. It's even better when it's cooked. But even raw is good. No! Warning. Above all, do not eat this white part, it is poison. There are a lot of them on the island. But there are mostly banana and coconut trees. You can eat almost that and be healthy. How do you know all this? My family runs a farm. Everyone works there. When we have to make charcoal, you have to spend a whole month alone in the mountains. That's why I know fruits and trees. The Mito Triplets. Lieutenant! Where are the Americans? Answer me! Answer me! Where do they come from? Not yankees! Yankees gone! Not yankees! The war is over! The war is over! You make the slightest gesture, I kill you! Warning! Covered! Kozuka, take the tour! Do you still see any? There's nothing left on my side! The same! Has anyone been hit? They said, "War over." You heard them, right? What if we had killed people with whom we are no longer at war? Who fired the first bullet? We? It's the Donkos. Corn... They said, "War over." They fired on us, we are still at war! Never let go! An enemy is an enemy, whether American or Filipino. There is an enemy, there is a mission! My mission... It's time I told you something. I am... I am not a regular army soldier. I got a secret education, in a secret school where I was trained for a mission. - This is... What kind of education? - You will listen to me, without speaking. Bad Boys! Good for nothing! Rascals! That's what they call you, right? Me, I grew up in a small coastal town. It doesn't matter which one. Just imagine the warm summer evenings without wind. Now imagine... Mosquitoes flying by the thousands in the night. You know the noise they make. Well imagine, the day they disappeared, the silence that has settled in. It was the day when a chemical came to America to put on the walls. In fact, they had not all disappeared. There were still those who rested on the ceiling. Head down. An awkward position and behavior considered stupid for most mosquitoes. Still, they survived! You are of that race. You land on the ceiling. You don't know yet but you have a rare gift for survival. There is war... and there is the secret war. SECRET WAR Intelligence, decryption of enemy propaganda, cover-up: we will teach you all these techniques. But above all, to think and decide alone. Because this war, it will happen to you to fight it alone. Secretly. We will therefore teach you secrets. Secret n ° 1: You don't have the right to die. Everyone else if they want, but not you! Always, you will have to find another solution. ALWAYS! Honor does exist, of course. Simply, concerning you, it is not any more in the same place. You alone will decide where he is. On the ceiling, for example. Because the principle that structures the secret war, it is that in the last instance, each is his own officer. Among the soldiers you will meet in the field, some will be reluctant because they will ignore the true nature of your mission and cling to their old reflexes. Thereby, you will need to find the most reliable men. In covert warfare, lightness and precision are fundamental. It would be better to be few in number than in bad company. Towards Sado the wind beats the grass and the leaves Isn't Sado a nice place to live? "Come on", you tell me. But I can't get there easily. Sado is far beyond the waves of the sea. From Sado, I can reach Izumozaki... You're wrong. It's not Izumozaki! It's "From Sado I can reach Kashiwazaki by boat"! What are you saying "Kashiwa"? No it's Izumozaki. No! By Sado I feel the heat of Niigata brought by the wind But why can't your voice reach me? It's like that in Katsutaro Komori's version! By Sado I can row to Izumozaki That's right? Do you agree? But why don't my feelings reach you? It ends with that, doesn't it? From Sado I can hear the song of the soldiers in Futamata. But why don't they sing anymore with me? I also like this song a lot. You know why? This song - sit down - has something special. What do you think it is? Is she from Sado? Looks like you like to have fun? I have a question for you. Is this the right place to have fun? No. Don't you think you can have fun and learn at the same time? Let's try again. This song, what's so special about it? I rephrase. When I sang, did I sing the same thing as you? No. So do the same as me. From Sado I can hear the song of the soldiers in Futamata. Every word is important. I did not say: "Sing the same thing as me". I said, "Do the same as me." By Sado I feel the heat of Niigata brought by the wind But why don't my feelings reach... I'm trying to teach you something. If you don't understand what I'm saying is that you have nothing to do here. Is that I was wrong, and that I should have left you in your tavern. For the last time, do the same as me. From Futamata I feel the Major's arm sweeping me to glory. But why can't I sit down at the table? This is what is special: whatever the lyrics, it's the same song. She is immortal. This also applies to the secret war. Improvisation, adaptation, initiative: this is the key. What matters is that the song continues to be sung. You, you alone, are your own officer! Your training is coming to an end. In a few hours you will be far from here. You are no longer ordinary soldiers. Lies, betrayal, humiliation. Nothing is forbidden to you! Nothing! The rest of the country will see it as infamy. No one will know that you are fighting with honor! Only you will know that you act with glory! Don't expect any reward. Here is our last secret: the only reward of the secret war, it is integrity. Integrity! It is glory without glory. Secret glory. You are absolutely forbidden to kill yourself! It might take 3 years, 5 years, but whatever happens we will come back for you! We will come back! If you have to live on coconut, do it! Eat roots! Eat dirt! But survive at all costs! Yes! Next, I received the mission order for Lubang. First, destroy the infrastructure. Then annihilate the enemy, prevent his landing. Hold this island until our strength returns. That's why I came in with so much ammo. Others, like me, had to be assigned to strategic Pacific islands. The four of us can blend into this island and spot it entirely. And when our strength is back, it will be enough for us to transmit the information, to enable them to establish a strategic base for combat. If the Americans have left the island, good for us! This island belongs to us. Whoever opposes it is our enemy! You can be scouts. Corn, this decision is up to you. If you don't want it, are going to surrender. I follow you, Lieutenant. Until the day of victory. I follow you too. I follow you too. This is the first enemy I kill. Me too. Our first task is to travel this island in all directions, to locate each parcel of it, until knowing it in its smallest details. Let's call it "The Wakayama Plain". This is my hometown. Come on, let's continue. "La Falaise du Serpent". What about your dizziness? More problems. "Machiko's udder". I knew a Machiko who had these udders. Uh... that's not it... It is... I meant... uh... "The Hill of the Dromedary". Let's say that. Let's call it whatever you want. "The south shore"... Our reserved area is the center, the jungle. No Donko will risk it. They know they will get killed. Corn we must have permanent and rapid access to ports and especially to the aerodrome. The intermediate areas are therefore essential: plains and semi-mountains. And there, it is more complicated. We are going to send them "messages". Let them know that their cultures are tolerated but that the land is ours. When they are always afraid, we will control the whole island. Questions? For the food? How long can we last with the leftover rice? "The rice that remains"? Akatsu... For once you open your mouth, what are you talking about? You mean, before you stole some, or after? Stop! I have a question. What messages are we going to send to the Donkos? - Over there! - Yes! To Sado The wind beats the leaves of the trees and the grass... It's enough! Let's go! I have finished spraying! Alight! We're gonna call it "Smoke Signals." We will do them at each harvest, everywhere. If there are Japanese troops or liaison officers in the surrounding islands, they will see these fires and understand that Lubang is still struggling. Hold it more firmly. It will be more solid. Tightens. Just before I left Japan, I made a pair for my daughter. Do you have a daughter? She was 2 when I left. She has to go to school now. What's her name? There are hardly any matches left. We're going to make a "requisition" tonight, the lieutenant and me. They only attack me. It's the rice you have in your pockets all the time. I'm hungry all the time. You should stay in bed a little longer. But what... We don't even have enemies. Who are we fighting against? You think too much. Think about something else. It helps to fall asleep. Me, I try to remember the faces and names of my classmates. And I find it amazing but I can remember all of them, even the ones I thought I had forgotten. And it plunges me into sleep without me realizing it. If he didn't want to surrender, Akatsu would have taken his gun. He must go to the nearest barracks. It's Looc's. I do not think so! He had to go get some bananas. I'm sure he's going to Tilik. - Without a weapon, he risks... - Well, he will die. He will have looked for it. Shimada. I'm taking care of it. Let me go. I don't want to stay with him. When it comes to Akatsu, you... That's enough! Fight if you have to, but realize your responsibilities. You don't move from here. JUNE 2 - DEPARTURE OF THE LIEUTENANT It's raining! It's raining! Should be enough, right? There is not enough! What? We need more! But how many do you need? Bring more! It was in the last letter I received... two years ago. It's my whole family. Is that your wife? Yes. She looks like you the little one. Her name is Keiko. HUT COMPLETED When the acacia flowers fall After crossing mountains and rivers we will be in Changchun Now that there are no more bandits The sun sets on the snow My sword is crying The troops advance in the desert of sand Even though our caps are freezing On the front line for the Fatherland We have struggled so far And we will fight until the end of winter Bye I'm 20 years old... That's it, you're standing. Happy birthday. Happy birthday, Akatsu. Happy birthday. AKATSU BIRTHDAY I would have died on my own. Thank you for not giving up on me. A family, it abandons its children? Don't doubt your family anymore. Come on, take a little rest. It comes undone because you only do a simple seam. You have to sew over and over again. Like that, it's solid. That's it, it won't rain anymore. We destroy and we clean. Did you find that? Oh! We live here. Not anymore. - Can't you wait five minutes? - So that you put his clothes back on? Are you kidding or what? Move on! Since when do you give me orders? Show me your stripes. What's the matter, Mie's dirty farmer! I don't need stripes! Stop! That's enough! You put off your sewing until later. We hurry. We haven't eaten meat for weeks. This is the priority. You have to sleep near a village, that's where there are cows. You don't even have to hesitate. Unlike you, we walked all day. So the priority is not to burn out. We will stay in the center tonight, we will eat bananas! Why don't you understand something so obvious? We all need meat! What is obvious to me now is that I want to beat you up! Eh? Repeat what you just said? What do you want? You have that mouth or what! Nothing but the mouth! You have nothing in the stomach! You'll see, asshole! Nothing but the mouth. One day I will kill you. It's okay, are you exhausted? We will bivouac there. Latrines. - Is it in Bago that there are cattle? - Yes. In addition, it is the nearest village. You're right. It's decided, tomorrow is meat day. Shimada is right. We all need it. Shimada, do you see them? Shimada! He breathes! Take him away! I can't see anymore... It was... our companion. He was strong and valiant. He taught us a lot... huh? I regret the harsh words... and the punches I gave you so much. I will not forget you. Do you have to talk to him like he's there? Is that the way to do it? I do not know what to tell you... I would like you to tell me if you're dead... for something, or for nothing! Because here Can no one answer me! Look at me. These peasants were armed. U.S. too. No! What is this attitude? You deserve the squad for sedition. You deserve it since your escape! I apologize because you were young but now it's over! Picked up. Go ahead. We only have knives. Picked up. Picked up. Picked up. Dirty Donko. Picked up. Picked up. He's the one who killed Shimada! KILL HIM! Where you go? I'm going to Shimada's grave. We don't do that in the middle of the night. Tomorrow. Go back to bed. Towards Sado... What are you doing? The wind beats the grass and the leaves. Stop that. I want to see the city of Sado with my own eyes. Lieutenant. Leave me my version. Even if there are only two of us left you will never be safe! You hear? You will always be in danger! As Japanese and as soldiers, we will give our best in this new year. Thank you for this meal. You have to get out. Whatever we did, they know we acted like soldiers. We had no way of knowing, but the war is over. No harm will be done to you. You must surrender. It's the truth! When I surrendered the people of the island were kind to me. People mandated by the Japanese government are with me. So you can go out in peace. Hiroo. I hope you can hear us. He's your brother, he's Toshiro. Hiroo. If you can hear us, come out unarmed. Hiroo. My son. It's a poem I wrote for you. "The south wind is blowing" "On the shore I stand" "Wait for a voice". Hiroo. I know you are doing your duty. But you have nothing more to prove. The situation has changed. Please... Try to change the way you look at things. No... It's not him. He never dresses Western. It's written in Japanese and English. They talk about a war in Indochina. But Japan doesn't seem involved. And now a word of sport. Baseball fans have unforgettable hours. The New York Yankees team came to Japan to play a friendly match. A crowd of supporters went to the airport to see Joe DiMaggio... No... Bullshit. It's reprints. They start from the originals and then tamper with the articles. They make some that are entirely false and some that are just corrected. Anything they don't want us to read, they take away. The same with radio, real shows are rigged and rebroadcast very quickly. The speed with which they do this, I have to admit, is impressive. But considering what I learned in Futamata about the radio broadcasts, it doesn't blow me away that much. What about the announcements? This... "Boys wanted, Steak Diner"? What is that? It means absolutely nothing! And every time they talk about the army, I don't understand a thing. One shot is the "Police Reserve Troops", one shot is the "Self-Defense Force". It never talks about maneuvers. If they're trying to deceive us, why don't they write coherent, easy-to-understand things? Conceived... An inhabitant of the moon reading an earth newspaper would understand nothing. They are stronger than we thought. They know that what sounds complicated, and even incomprehensible, rings true! We must ration the batteries. We restrict listening to the night. Corn... It is important to listen and to decipher. It is important. Also, on this day, at Tokyo station, the "Tsubame" express train was in service with great fanfare. At the cutting of the green ribbon by President Sogo, the express "Tsubame" launches its new service. The "light green" colored oars slide on all tracks. OK, let's go. It is very possible that Japan has become a democracy. But the government still seems to want to build "Greater East Asia". And this "Self-Defense Force" is necessarily still engaged against the Americans. Communist China, Mao Zedong, that too we can believe. Mao certainly had to eject the Americans and the British to gain Japanese support. Basically, we have the same goal. It's okay to join forces. This alliance, we only have to call it: "East Asian Co-prosperity League". I see... It's weird, but at the same time, it's pretty logical. And do you think these are the only two states in the League? It is possible that Northern Siberia rejected the atheism of the Soviets to join the League. Siberia? You mean that... This region... Russia would be surrounded by the countries of the League? In fact it is really possible! And in my opinion, we can add Java and Sumatra. In 1944, twenty from Futamata went to Java to lead the guerrillas. Okay... The big question for us is: where is the Philippines? Absoutely. Remember the planes. Five years ago, it was two a day maximum. Since then it has only increased, sometimes up to more than ten a day. It proves better that there is intense activity in our area. War is near, it is here! Do you think that what "Sony" is talking about, the fighting in Indochina, is that part of the League's war of reconquest? Obvious! It's right in front of us! And think of one thing... Organize a fake expedition with Akatsu, find people who look like my brother and my father. Imagine the money and time spent! Get information about my family, train two people to imitate their voices? All this to deceive and capture two soldiers? It means that our island is a highly strategic point! I always knew it! If there wasn't an imminent Japanese operation in the area, they would never do that! The army will soon send scouts to establish contact. Or not... Surely first, a single agent. We must watch out for the slightest... My father's haiku! - Your father's haiku? - Wait, wait, wait... Suppose it was really my father. There must be some hidden meaning in the haiku... a message. "The southerly wind..." "The south wind is blowing" "On the shore I stand Waiting for a voice" Incredible! With your memory, you would have made a good recruit for Futamata! You're exaggerating! "The south wind is blowing" "On the shore I stand" "Wait for a voice" What kind of code could that be? Do you remember the old man said something afterwards... It was... Here : "You have to change the way you look at things." Something like that. Sounds weird, doesn't it? Major Taniguchi always said: "Every word is important". VOICE SHORE Need to find other combinations? I don't know, I'm looking. BLOWING RIVAGE VOICE "A voice is blowing on the shore..." "Wait... wait... for the wind"? "Wait for the wind". "On the shore I stand". Shore... WAIT SOUTH SHORE You had to read horizontally! It's an injunction! You're right! It's awesome! Everything is completely consistent. So that was it... "Changing the way of seeing" The simplicity of haiku, therefore the simplicity of the code! The south shore... If we have to wait, it's because something big is going to happen there. The agent. That's it! In all the time we've been here, we've never bathed. It is a good island. Yes... We could have come across a much worse place. Even in Japan you know, there aren't a lot of places like that. Right now, I don't miss Japan. Finally... Except the women! When we get home, we'll be heroes. You'll have all the women you want. I say... I'm happy to have you as my boss. Me too. I couldn't have come across a better second than you. Things are well done. Kozuka! I'm coming! "Houston... Radio check..." "Now we can clearly see the surface of the Moon." "I'm at the bottom of the ladder..." "The surface looks like powder..." "A very fine powder." "I'm about to go down..." "Everything's good, we're getting the camera ready." "It's a small step for... uh... The Man." "We are July 21, 1969..." "It's 11:56 am." Rain... Typhoon... Don't kill me... She's more afraid of the typhoon than of us. Since we didn't kill her, she thinks we're nice. You're right, she's a retarded one. When do you think the rain will subside? Minimum four weeks. If we chase her away, she is bound to talk about it. And tomorrow the Donkos will be there. It means, destroy the hut right away. Erase the traces. Good. We keep it tonight and tomorrow we decide. Okay. I take care. Where do you live? Tilik? Vigo? I like... Lubang. It's good Lu bang. What's your name? You? Iniez. Or we release it. Or... Or what? Go ahead, say it. Either we keep it until the end of the rain... Either we get rid of it. In play! In play! I'm still causing you trouble. We had no choice. There is no longer any risk of infection. I'll do laundry! What are you talking about? You can hardly walk, if you do laundry... I have to walk, you said! Not that far. You can't run, if there's anything. Stop. You are in pain, you are going to reopen the wound. Shut your mouth! I don't want to stay there anymore, doing nothing. I can't stand staying in this rotten hut anymore! Kinshichi... Where's your gun? My gun? Don't tell me you put it in the river. It's not normal, I put it there... - Why did you do that? - But I swear... He went into the current! Do you understand what you did? He's going to get to Brol. You lost your weapon! I'll find him. I go me! You stand guard here! In 3 minutes if we haven't found it, we'll pick it up at the hut. Here, put this on. It's finish. Go on! Looked. It's a whirlwind. It turns the tide. He's there! Excuse me for yelling. Kinshichi! Cut the rope! They're fishermen, they don't have guns! Shimada... I do not forget you... I'll be back. Captain Hayakawa, Second Kuroda... You have never been forgotten. You are always with me here. Sick of Camp 900... Your sacrifice is not forgotten. Mito triplets... This is where you lost your lives. I'm not forgetting any of you. When the acacia flowers fall After crossing mountains and rivers we will be in Changchun Now that there are no more bandits The sun sets on the snow My sword is crying The troops advance in the desert of sand Even though our caps are freezing On the front line for the Fatherland We have struggled so far And we will fight until the end of winter Bye I would like to speak with you. I know you have lived something long and difficult. The war is over... since 1945. Onoda-san. What are you planning to do? Die here? Wouldn't you like to go back to Japan with me? This song, how...? Akatsu spoke about it. I have read everything that has been written about you. Who sent you? I am just a tourist. Onoda-san, you smoke, don't you? I also brought food. You can't stay here. I would like to speak with you. Take your things. You know, in Japan most people think you're dead. Onoda-san, since when have you been alone? Thanks, tell me your story. Let's drink. Sweet red beans. I don't really want to either. But it is the situation that demands it. I live in peace, you at war. Our two positions are not compatible. But, to resolve this contradiction, why not try drunkenness! Maybe that will inspire us with the solution. Onoda-san. Aren't you ashamed to let me drink alone like this? I have traveled a lot. I have seen 50 countries! And you? Me I... I swore to myself that I would find three things: a wild panda. Lieutenant Onoda. And the Yeti! In this order! But still, to be really sitting in front of you, sharing the same dish... I hadn't really imagined it. Not even in dreams. I am honored. You have to sing. Let's sing, Onoda-san! Sing with me. Taniguchi... Yoshimi. He's my direct supervisor. Go find him. He will know what to do. Find Major Taniguchi and bring him here. It's heavier than I expected. This place, what do you call it? La Berge Kozuka. You'll really get out of the forest, eh? Will you come for real? Yes. I promise. So, see you in two weeks. Do you have a book on the Philippines? More specifically on the fighting in the Philippines. During the Pacific War. We have no military books. I'm sorry. In fact, i need something else Taniguchi-san. I'm going to have to apologize, I can't be of any help. I no longer have any connection with my military activities. Ah... how young I was. As you know, everyone was embroiled in this war. But you must remember Onoda Hiroo. Well... I'm afraid... no. But you must have heard of him. And Lubang. Everyone knows him. He is the last soldier of the war. I don't read newspapers. And then there are soldiers all over the place. With all the wars there is in the world. You know very well what I mean. From that war... he is the last soldier. I repeat, I do not read the newspapers. I only read books. He says he won't get out of the jungle. That he needs an order. I just told you that I no longer have any connection with the army. Why not ask the Self-Defense Force? Onoda-san will not take his orders... than you. I do not know him. I don't know this man or this island. I'm sorry, but... Earlier you offered me some tea. I think I'll take some. BERGE TANIGUCHI Thank you very much. It was there that I met him. He gave names to the places. There are starting to be mosquitoes. If we make a fire, there may be even more.
