(Buddhist prayers) (Buddhist prayers) (Buddhist prayers) (Buddhist prayers) "Invaded by foreign troops," "the Republic of China was subjected to" "colonial plundering in the early years." "Warlords fawned on foreign forces" "and oppressed the civilians." "The chaos turned China into a hellhole." "Dengfeng City, Henan" Amit훮bha. Amit훮bha. Senior, he's still alive. Hang in there... After them! Kill them all! - Sir, take a bun. - Here you go. Thank you... - Be careful. - Be careful. - Slowly does it. - Slowly does it. - Be careful. - Be careful. - Thank you. - Thank you. Senior, another 200 refugees just arrived. Ching Hung, winter's coming soon. Set up more tents before the place's covered by snow. We've run out of timber and straw mats. How are we going to build the tents? Let them stay at our place then. Don't do that. I hate the cold. Look at these buns. They're getting smaller each day. So you needn't worry about the cold weather. You'll probably starve to death before winter arrives. "Shaolin Temple" Let's go... Search the place! Get out! Get out! Go to hell! Get out! - Step aside! - Get out! Don't do this! Get out of the way! Hold your horses! You can't enter the temple like this. Stay where you are! Stop right there! Dismount right now! Dismount right now! "The Origin of Martial Arts" Abbot, save me. Bloody monks! We'll kill whoever offers refuge to General Hau's enemies. That's not my concern. Nobody disrespects Shaolin Temple! Bring it on. You! Stop helping him or you'll meet your maker. He's lost too much blood. Get me powder to stanch the blood. Yes, Abbot. General Hau's here. They greeted you with Shaolin martial arts. You shouldn't have drawn your gun. That was rude. General. - Sir. - Stay where you are, Abbot. Don't bother saving him. It'll only be a waste of your time. Amit훮bha. Buddha offers sanctuary to all. Since he's here, I must save him even if he's on his last legs. Please show some compassion, sir. Refrain from further bloodshed. I won't have peace of mind unless he dies. If you're fearless, you'll be free of desire. Allow kindness to bloom within and you'll realise everywhere is utopia. Utopia? You've been living in seclusion for too long. This country's at war. If he doesn't die, the war won't end. How are we going to find our utopia? Hau Kit. I concede defeat. Dengfeng City's yours. I won't fight you anymore. I'll transfer all my assets to you. And this... It's a treasure map. Take it. Just spare my life. I promise I won't come back. Thank you. - Abbot! - Abbot! Abbot! - Abbot... - Sir... - Sir... - Abbot... Protect the temple! Ching Nang, Ching Hung, stand down. We come with joy and depart with sorrow to wander among mankind. Without coming or going, there'll be no joy or sorrow. Amit훮bha. Let's go. "The Origin of Martial Arts is no big deal" Brother. Why don't we meet the foreigners tomorrow? Why? With the money, we can buy more weapons to conquer Zhengzhou. Guns are only powerful if you use them. Why didn't you shoot when we were at Shaolin? Were you showing compassion? Remember this. If you hesitate when the odds are in your favour, you can get ready to meet your maker after your enemy recovers. In future, I won't show mercy to anyone who stands in your way. I'll hold you to that. Yes. Brother, Sung Fu's here. Call him General Sung. General Sung. What a poseur. He stayed away from the battlefield, but he's quick to show up for the rewards. Brother, Dengfeng City's ours. Fok Lung's dead. What a gaudy display just because of one man. I even thought it was your funeral. We lost hundreds of men. So? Do you expect me to pay the price? Are you feeling exploited because I didn't help you? If my leg weren't injured, I could've subdued him single-handedly. Do you agree, Brother? Of course. He's just grieving for our dead comrades, but I don't really care. I know. It's Dengfeng City that you care about. Sister-in-law, it's been a while. - Brother. - Sing Naam, my favourite niece. Greet Uncle Sung. Uncle Sung, how do you do. Good girl. Sister-in-law. Sing Naam's so refined and well-mannered. And a pretty girl to boot. I can't let her end up with another man. She must marry my son. It's decided. Brother, they're still kids. Wait until they are older. We can arrange the marriage for them. You don't like the idea? Let's resolve this through a fight then. Lovely. I like it. This is a fully-automatic machine gun. You can't get it anywhere else. I'll take 80 sets. What's the price? You can have them for free as long as General Hau let us build railroads in Dengfeng City. What did you say? I didn't hear you clearly. I said you could have them for free as long as you let us build railroads. I don't want your guns. - General? - I don't want your guns! Let's go. We'll head to the eastern side of town. I believe General Sung Fu would be interested in them. Please wait a moment, Sir Peter. Brother. These are really good guns. If they wind up in Sung Fu's hands... Show the guests out. Yes, sir. This way, please. You just don't get it. Talking to me this way is unacceptable unless our roles are reversed. Is that clear? Is that clear? They want to use us to exploit China. Endorsing their plans for building railroads is like opening the floodgates for the foreigners to occupy our land. China belongs to the Chinese. If the foreigners try to seize our land, I'll tear them apart! I only hope Sung Fu thinks the same way. Have I been talking to a brick wall? For more than 20 years, he's my only sworn brother. Don't speak ill of him. You're not in a position to criticise him. But you've got a point. Arrange a meeting with Sung Fu. I'm feeling dizzy. What's wrong with your mouth? - I'm eating biscuits. - Biscuits? Now, I'm eating noodles. Hunger has driven you crazy. You know nothing. This is called willpower. Willpower? What do you know about willpower? We've run out of rice. What will happen to the people? When there were famines in the past, Justice Bao would distribute food or Robin Hood-like outlaws would lend the people a hand. But now, there are only wicked warlords. Hey, Senior. Why don't we take a leaf from Robin Hood? Robin Hood? Yes. We should help the people like Robin Hood did. But Senior, that goes against our precepts. What are you afraid of? Second Senior will bail us out. He enjoys helping the oppressed, doesn't he? Of course. Of course... Slow down, Missy. Sing Naam! Get up. Are you all right, Missy? - Are you all right? - Missy... Why didn't you keep an eye on her? - Why did you let her fall? - I'm sorry. - Were you out to kill her? - Dad... I'm fine. Don't scold the nanny. It was my fault for running. I'm very sorry, sir. I'm sorry. Get out... - Does it hurt? - Are you all right? - I'm fine. - Let me take a look. Dad, I drew this for you. "My dad likes to fight. By Sing Naam." Is this me? Come on. Brother. Hold on to it for me. Give it back later or I'll smack you. Let's go. I've handed the invitation letter to General Sung. He was delighted. General Sung, his wife and his son will be meeting us at the scheduled time tomorrow night at Chung Ngok Restaurant. Let me ask you something. Sung Fu knew I have Fok Lung's riches. Why didn't he ask for a share? He wants it all, including my share. It's never wrong to strike first. So this is a great opportunity. Listen. Send 30 top fighters to the restaurant to lay in ambush. I won't have peace of mind unless he dies. You're brilliant, Brother. Are you planning to kill Brother Sung? Do you have a problem with that? He's your sworn brother. Are you sure about this? My sworn brother wants to get rid of me. Do you have a better suggestion? I'll listen to you. Don't ask me. I don't know. Just promise me... you won't spill blood before our daughter. Can you do that? How audacious of you. Senior, so we're stealing rice and noodles. We're not stealing; we're just taking. Fine. So how much do we take? Does it matter? Take whatever we can. Ching Hoi, fabled outlaws always leave behind a flower as a symbol. What shall we leave behind? - How about your bald head? - You! - There's rice! - Son, wake up. - We've got rice. - Wake up. We've got rice. There's rice. - Heaven's helping us. - We've got rice... Thank you, Heaven. - Thank you, Bodhisattva. - There's rice. What's going on over there? Let's have a look. Who are these people? When I tap on the table top, take our daughter to the toilet. Dad, must I go to the toilet during dinner? Do as I say and I promise I'll never fight again. This way, please. Brother, Sister-in-law. - Brother, Sister-in-law. - Brother. You're late again. My sincere apologies. Greet your elders. Uncle Sung, Auntie Sung, how do you do. Man San, greet your elders. Uncle, Auntie. Good boy. Generals. Master Sung's born in the Year of the Rabbit and Miss Hau, the Year of the Goat. They're a perfect match. Their birthdays and birth signs complement each other too. They'll enjoy happiness together. They're a match made in heaven. I'm sure they'll have a long-lasting marriage with many offspring and both families will prosper from their union. Well said... To Buddhists, marriage is a predestined bond, without which a couple couldn't tie the knot. Given their bond, this young couple's destined to be together. What are we waiting for then? Hurry, bring us the proposals. What's the hurry? I can't wait. She's such a fine daughter-in-law. I can't afford to lose her. Generals, once you exchange proposals, this marriage's sealed. It's sealed then. Here you go. Congratulations... Brother, I'll prepare the gifts. Brother. Now that we're family, I'll not mince my words. Speak your mind. How should we carve up Dengfeng City which you've seized? Tell me. Didn't we agree on equal shares? It's all yours. From now on, there's no need to share. You can have it all. There'll be peace then. Just cut to the chase. Brother, I'm getting old. I can't go to war anymore. Look, even my leg's useless now. It's time for me to call it quits. And since we're now in-laws, even if you take my share, you'll leave your assets to my son anyway. I have it all worked out. I've got nothing to lose. I've kept this bottle of wine for years. I've been waiting for the right occasion and today's the day. Cheers! Here's to our union. General, you have a confidential note. Son, do you need to pee? No. Be a good boy. Go to the loo with your mum. Sister-in-law, take Sing Naam along too. Let's go. - Captain Wong. - Yes, sir. - All of you, leave the room too. - Yes. "General, beware of Hau Kit's ambush" You... You... You scoundrel! I regarded you as my own brother. We were comrades who went through trials and tribulations together. - Is this true? - That's enough. Sing Naam, run! - Mum! - Run! Mum! Run. Mum, I'm scared! Over there! Hurry... Sing Naam! Mum. Mum. Mum. Sing Naam, run! Mum. Run, Sing Naam! Find a place to hide. Sing Naam... General! Dad! Sing Naam! Stop! General, run! Run! Sing Naam! - Sing Naam. - Dad... Over there! Dad. Dad... Dad. Sing Naam! Dad. Dad. Sing Naam! Help! - Help us, Abbot! - Sir... Please stay where you are. Abbot! Abbot, help! Please save her, Abbot. - Please save her. - Get moving! Out of the way... She needs help... Abbot! Get me needles, ointment and hot water. - Yes. - Abbot, please save her. Sing Naam... Hang in there, you'll be fine. Hang in there. Abbot will save you. Don't worry. Madam. - Madam, you haven't recovered. - Sing Naam. Don't walk around. Madam. Sing Naam. Sing Naam, be a good girl. Hang in there. - Sing Naam. - Hold her tight. Hang in there. What's going on? What happened to her? Sing Naam. Talk to me... Don't worry. Abbot promised to save you. Hang in there. What's wrong? Why did you stop? Save her! Is it because I have blood on my hands? That's on me! My daughter's innocent... Dad. I'm fine. Don't scold them. Don't yell at them. - Sure, I'll listen to you. - Sing Naam. I won't yell at them. - I beg of you. - Sing Naam! - Please save her. - Sing Naam! Mum. - Sing Naam! - They said she'd be fine. - Sing Naam! - She'll really be fine. Mum, I missed you. Let's go home. I won't get mad anymore. - Sing Naam, hang in there. - Sing Naam. - I beg of you. - Let's go home. She's my only child. I beg of you. Please save her. Wake up, Sing Naam. Sing Naam, you want to go home, don't you? Sing Naam! - Sing Naam! - Please help her. - Sing Naam! - Please save her. - Sing Naam! - I beg of you. Sing Naam. Say something to me... - She's fine. - Go away! Sing Naam... Sing Naam, wake up. - Sing Naam! - Sing Naam won't die. Sing Naam won't die. Sing Naam, don't leave me. - Cleanse her body, Ching Hoi. - She's fine. - Yes. - Sing Naam! Abbot, she's still alive! Please save her. I beg of you... I beg of you. Please save her. I beg of you. Please save her. Please show compassion and save her. Abbot, please save her! My daughter mustn't die. Listen up. If my daughter dies, all of you will die with her! - Abbot, please help me. - That's enough. Amit훮bha. Can't you see that this is your retribution? It's all your fault! She's still alive. I shouldn't have gone along with your plans. She's not dead. - If it weren't for you, - She's alive. She wouldn't have died. - I won't let her die. - Take a look! - I promise she won't die. - She's gone. - I won't let her die. - Return her to me! - I won't! - It should have been you! - We are so sorry. - Sing Naam. - It's my fault. - My daughter's dead. - My daughter's dead. - It's all my fault. My daughter's dead! Are you happy now? Buddha's mercy is nothing but a lie! How dare you refuse to save her! I have no qualms killing monks! I'll start with you, old man! - Sir... - Let go of me! Sir... Sir... Sir... - I'll kill you all! - Set up formation. I'll kill you all! I'll kill you all! I'll kill you all. To leave or to stay in Shaolin. To leave or to stay in Shaolin. To leave or to stay in Shaolin. To leave or... To leave or to stay in Shaolin. Leave Shaolin... This one doesn't count. To leave or to stay in Shaolin. To leave or to stay in Shaolin. - Hey! - To leave... Is anyone there? Hey! I thought I got a boar, but it's a man. And a bloodied man at that. I know you, you're Hau Kit. Are you going to kill more people? Men are worse than pigs when they're muddled. Have a good rest while you're down there. Stop howling though. It's a nice place to sort out your thoughts. Amit훮bha. "Wanted" "For treason and murder" "Bounty: 50,000 silver coins" Have some food. Be careful, it's hot. Don't choke on it. Why? Why? Your wife has left Shaolin. You'll decide your daughter's funeral. Would you want burial or cremation? Abbot would like to know. If she's buried, you can still visit her grave during festivals. But you don't stay in Shaolin. Are you able to rush back? I think cremation's more convenient. You can take her with you wherever you go. You can commemorate her wherever you are. What do you think? If you're choosing cremation, light the fire after you're done eating. Burn them all! Fire! You would rather die than yield? I'd rather join Brother on the way to hell. Fire! When you were a wanted man, Brother saved you. I can't believe this is how you show your gratitude. Gratitude? He didn't save me; he made use of me. He knew I was a good fighter. He needed me. I had the highest kill rate in every battle. I helped him conquer all of his turf. Do you know why I rebelled? You'll get to live if you answer correctly. That's because you're a mongrel! Wrong. I rebelled because he was too fearful. That paved the way for his downfall. He's gotten his just deserts. My time has come. Do you understand? "My dad likes to fight. By Sing Naam." It's chaotic outside. There are hot on your heels. Since it doesn't matter who turns you in and I did prepare your meals after all, why don't you let me earn the 50,000 silver coins? "Bounty: 100,000 silver coins" When did it become 100,000 silver coins? I was just kidding. Shaolin monks are compassionate. We won't do this. So what's your plan? I don't intend to leave. Are you taking this place as your home? What are you doing? Are you mad at me? Or yourself? Do you need some help? - First Senior. - First Senior. - First Senior. - First Senior. There's an overstock of rice in the kitchen. Do you know how that came about? Overstock of rice? It must be due to Buddha's grace. Amit훮bha... Do also consult Buddha about the masked men who're always prancing around on rooftops. Masked men? Why would there be masked men in the temple? They came here to steal our rice. No, they brought the stolen rice to us. Those involved in stealing the rice will be punished after our morning prayers. - Yes, First Senior. - Yes, First Senior. What's he doing here? It's you again. What do you want? Amit훮bha. - Abbot. - Abbot. Abbot, I wish to stay in Shaolin. It's not up to you to decide. You're now a wanted man. You just want to seek refuge in Shaolin. I've decided to become a monk. Shaolin Temple isn't your battlefield. It's not up to you to decide. Go back to where you belong. Abbot, didn't you say that Buddha offers sanctuary to all? That doesn't include you. Abbot. You can tame his body, but not his mind. Abbot, he used to be such a sinful warlord. He'd only cast Shaolin Temple in a bad light. Every sentient being can attain enlightenment. We shouldn't discriminate. Everything's impermanent, except karma. His mind's full of hatred. He'll never attain good karma. Be that as it may, we can't stop people from learning the Dharma which's open to everyone. Afflictions lead to wisdom. Since he's feeling confused, he may be close to enlightenment. I'd suggest we let him stay for now. So Abbot dumped you here? Off you go. It's better here in Shaolin than out there. It's a dog-eat-dog world out there. Off you go. You'll feel cold after shaving your head. Put this on. Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning. Good morning. "The Origin of Martial Arts is no big deal" - Please make way. - Thank you... Here comes the buns... Queue up, everyone... - Slowly does it. - Over there... Be careful. The buns are hot. Over there. There are buns. Thank you. - Thank you. - Is it so difficult? No. Don't worry, there's enough for everyone. Strike quickly at lightning speed. Train in the Way. Move in the cycle. Dance in the passion. Learn the wonder. Awaken the spirit. Get a barrel for the vegetables. All right. - Senior Mo Dou. - What's the matter? Why do you practise martial arts? Martial arts? Yes, I've learned martial arts for two years. But like you, I couldn't focus. So I became a cook. We should learn from Bodhi dharma. He meditated by facing a wall for nine years. He gained internal and external strength. He never fought with anyone. He was full of wisdom. Even his hair was wiser than us. That state of mind is called Martial Zen. Train with us. Let the fists and the heart become one. Let the elbows and the knees become one. Let the shoulders and the groin become one. Let the heart and the mind become one. Let the mind and the breath become one. Let the breath and the strength become one. Train in the Way. Move in the cycle. Dance in the passion. Learn the wonder. Awaken the spirit. Keep it up, Brothers. I used to be able to do that. Keep it up. Thank you. Thank you. Press his Renzhong acupoint. You'll be fine. Give it to him. Here you go. It's so cold. Why are you still training? I'm training because I'm cold. Aren't you cold? A little. Train with me then. Sure. Abbot, how would you rate him? His moves come from the heart and are guided by the mind. They're so natural. Through Martial Zen, he's finally resolved his hatred. I don't do martial arts. It's beyond me. Just like martial arts, cooking's a way to enlightenment too. The principle's the same. Mo Dou. Life's about trials and tribulations. Like I often tell you, leave the temple to see the world. All I know how to do is cook. I'll be useless in the secular world. I'm staying. Which is more useful? Gold or mud? Gold, of course. But to a seed? Never underestimate yourself. Everyone has a purpose in life. Tso Man, you want us to help the foreigners build railroads. But our ancestors are buried on Mount Mang. Construction works will disrupt the fengshui. Our ancestors won't allow it. I'm fine with railroad construction per se. But I don't trust these foreigners. What if they have a hidden agenda? Tso Man, how you treated Hau Kit is none of our business. However, he used to say that the foreigners are actually eyeing our land and only using railroad plans as excuses. Enough of the rhetoric. The fate of Henan province shouldn't be decided by one man. Given Tso Man's attitude, he must've sealed a deal with the foreigners. He never intended to heed our feedback. Let's go. Like I said, there's nothing to be gained for going against me. He's considered lucky. His family... will suffer a worse fate. I'm giving you the choice. Be my friend or my foe. I promise you. As long as I make money, all of us will profit from it. I'm so worried. Ma'am, please stop crying. He isn't home yet. What should I do? Please don't cry. Crying won't bring him back. What happened? Master, my son hasn't been home in more than 20 days. What should I do? Construction of railroads for Tso Man? My entire family's depending on him. - Get cracking. - Dig. - Dig deeper. - Move it! Don't slack off. Step on it. - Hurry. - What do you think you're doing? Step on it. Move it! Step on it... Dig deeper. Get to work. Who is it? Why did you take so many lives? General Hau? Why did you take so many lives? It's Tso Man's order. Leave now. Leave now! Hau Kit's alive! - Beat it. - Hau Kit's still alive! Let's go. Tso Man lied to us about building railroads. We were made to dig up relics for the foreigners. Tso Man is trading national relics for cannons and ammunition. He didn't want us telling anyone so he's killing all the workers. There are still many workers at his residence. I'm afraid they'll be killed tomorrow after the job's done. Amit훮bha. Go home. All right. Let's go. - Tai Ngau... - My son... What happened? What happened? All negative karma is the result of greed, ignorance and hatred. It stems from my action, speech and thought. I now repent before Buddha. Evil thoughts give rise to afflictions. That's enough! Positive thoughts dispel them. Sing Naam! If the mind's emptied of all thoughts, If it weren't for you, she wouldn't have died! We'll enter a state of purity. We must learn to let go before we can learn to face life. From now on, take refuge in the Triple Gem. Take refuge in the Buddha. Take refuge in the Dharma. Take refuge in the Sangha. From now on, your Dharma name's Ching Gok. - Amit훮bha. - Amit훮bha. - Amit훮bha. - Amit훮bha. Capture Hau Kit alive! Run! Everyone... Run... Run... It's Tso Man! I'll deal with him! Come back. Sit down. Stay calm. No matter what happens, we must stay calm. First, take some men to Tso's place to divert his troops. Our top priority. Should be to rescue the prisoners. You can't go, they will kill you. If my death can save multiple lives, it'll be worthwhile. All right. Ching Gok, be careful. Stay where you are. - Stay where you are. - Stay where you are. Amit훮bha. Please stop your killing. Evil deeds only bring about bad karma. That was for my daughter. Amit훮bha. You're worth your salt indeed. I knew you couldn't have died just like that. Brother, I missed you so much. Really? You won't have peace of mind unless I die? Nonsense. That's not true. Can you spare Shaolin Temple and me? Ching Gok's buying time for us to carry out our rescue mission. If you're so rash, you'll only ruin our plan. Do you understand? You once taught me that if I hesitate when the odds are in my favour, I'll end up meeting my maker. I remember that lesson well. I'm willing to die if you could spare Shaolin Temple. Tie up the Abbot! If anyone acts rashly, I'll kill him. It's fine. Stand down. Go ahead. - Abbot. - Abbot. Beautiful. Make sure they're delivered to Zhengzhou before dawn. Don't worry. With Tso's troops offering protection, we're free to go anywhere in Dengfeng City. Hurry up... Be careful. - Hurry up. - Keep an eye on it. Let's go. - Get out of the way. - Hurry. Get out of the way. - Hurry. - Hurry. Get out of the way. - Get out of the way. - Hurry. Be careful with the goods. - Hurry. - Hurry. Hurry. Move it. Isn't this place a lot nicer now? Stop wasting time. If you want to kill me, do it. Why would I? In fact, I hope you can forgive me. I hope you can lead me to conquer the world once more. That's why I've been mobilising our forces. Look around you, Brother. I made all these just for you. The throne's yours and so is the imperial robe. Tso Man. Do power and wealth really mean so much to you? Listen to me. Don't be as ignorant as I was. Stop shedding crocodile tears! I was just toying with you. Don't you dare look down on me. I have a gift for you. Bring her out. I've helped you track down Sister-in-law. I kept her alive so you could reunite with her. Turn around. I'm so sorry. I thought I had it all. I thought I could protect my family. But I only brought harm your way. Raise your guns. Load your guns. Fire! Guards, stay here. The rest, come with me. Yes, sir. Move it. Come on. The relics have been stolen! - After them! - After them! Run! No! Brother. I can't believe you're crying. Spare her! Even your death won't be able to satisfy me. You saw your daughter die. Now, I want you to watch your wife die. I'd like that a lot more. Spare her... I'm a monk now! She's no longer my wife! Spare her! I beg you, Tso Man. She's no longer my wife. Your wife is a beautiful woman. What a pity. Spare her! General, Shaolin monks have taken the relics and freed the prisoners. Please spare her! Even monks are dishonest. Kill them. Ching Gok, leave now! Run! Run! - First Senior! - First Senior! Leave now! - Leave now! - First Senior! - First Senior! - Leave now! Leave now! - First Senior! - First Senior! I want all of you to leave now! - First Senior! - First Senior! First Senior! Are all of you going to disobey me? - First Senior! - Open the door! Leave now! - First Senior! - First Senior! Leave now! Let's go. We'll send these men back first. What are all of you doing? Get back inside. Abbot. Little monks, don't test my patience. I'm warning you, go back now. I don't wish to kill children. Please show some compassion, sir. Let us save Abbot. You'll be happy after doing a good deed. Sir, Abbot has taught us that the one who repents is a hero. Don't be stubborn. Go home. Your family must be waiting for you. This is ridiculous. Are you trying to rebel? Capture them! Amit훮bha. Drop your weapons. I don't know martial arts. Stop fighting. Stop fighting. Abbot... Fry them like you would vegetables. Knead them like you would dough. - Well done! - Well done! - Abbot. - Are you all right? Hurry, check on everyone else. - What's going on? - It's them. Let's take a look. Fu, you're back? Mother! Sister! Ching Nang's sacrifice wasn't in vain. Do not dwell upon his death. Everyone, please pack up. We're leaving Shaolin now. I know you're feeling scared. I am too. Who wouldn't be if his family's gone and his home's lost? Amit훮bha. During the time I've spent with all of you, I've realised that Shaolin's my utopia. It's also my home. Today, Shaolin Temple may face destruction. But the spirit of Shaolin, all the flora that blossoms here and every beam, pillar, brick and tile will forever be a part of us. Shaolin has taught me to be determined and brave. I hope all of you can live your lives well. Please live your lives well. Lend me a hand. Let me help you. Be careful. Do me a favour. Yes? Lead them out of here. No, I can't. I've never left Shaolin. No way... I'm scared. You're scared? Look at them. Look at them carefully. They're more scared than you are. They need you. Am I really up to the task? All right. I can do it. We need to hurry up. We must escort them to safety. Ching Hoi, leave with Abbot. Ching Hung, get going. I'll join you later. - Move it. - I'll fight it out with them! Are you scoundrels trying to destroy Shaolin? I'll send you to the netherworld first. Tso Man, what do you want? You ought to know that you've already got far more than you need. Please put an end to this. Stop the killing. But we're born to kill on the battlefield. Don't repeat my mistake. You don't want to live in regret like I do. A ruler shouldn't cause chaos. Can we stop fighting? What do you think? I concede defeat. They took my treasure. We need to cut our losses. We cannot allow news of what has happened to leak out. Kill everyone in there. Fire! Shaolin Temple? My foot! No one insults Shaolin Temple. Amit훮bha. Abbot, I can't find my daughter.
