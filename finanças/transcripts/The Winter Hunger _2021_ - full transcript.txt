They say when you're close to death you can glimpse the other side and those that await you there. The news said the infection was close. Parents arrived at dawn to take their children. The school was almost deserted. Only our cook, our dear Luisa, decided to stay with us. But first she had to pick up her son Nelson from the city. She could not make it. She returned sooner than expected. Clinging to our daily routines made us feel safe. Then... it happened. Search for places far from big cities and difficult to access. Travel during the day and hide before dark. Warning! Attention! This is a broadcast to all national stations from the National Emergency Service to contain and prevent the spread of the 8456 rabies disease outbreak. Attention, this is not a drill. I repeat, this is not a drill. We recommend following these instructions for your safety. Fuck, can you turn that off? No. They might broadcast. No one's there, it's a fucking tape Secondly, if you must leave your house, do so during the day. It's getting dark. I'm keeping watch. Yeah, yeah. Do not confront an infected person. If you see one and remain unseen, stay still. - If you are detected... - Fuck! What the hell! I can't stand this. We'd be better off in the fucking... Big cities are easily infected as they are very populated. Therefore, search for places far from big cities and difficult to access. Travel during the day and hide before dark. Warning! Attention! This is a broadcast to all... Hey. Hey! What do you think of this one? What do you mean? Can we fucking trust him? All this kindness is bugging me. Where did you find...? His name is Equis. What kind of name is that? Good name. What is up with him? He doesn't want to speak or is he retarded? He is not retarded! He is surely smarter than any of us. Good name, indeed. We are on a mousetrap. Good Lord! It'd be better if he stayed quiet. - Zombies will even hear him. - They're not zombies. As if they were. I don't get why you're here. Oh God... We both know it's true. Mario. We barely know each other and... someone else would've left me. We take care of each other. You are brave. He's saying he likes you. We stand a better chance with them. Isabel! No! Asshole. Travel during the day... Go to sleep. It's just another nightmare. Bad conscience. .. .prevent the spread of the 8456 rabies disease outbreak. Attention, this is not a... Shit! Let's go! What's wrong? They're here. What do you mean? They are coming in. They are aggressive, fast and lethal. Four, big cities are easily infected as they are very populated. Therefore, search for places far from big cities and difficult to access. Travel during the day and hide before dark. Warning! Attention! The infected always look for dark places at dawn. For some time they still have understanding and therefore go to the places they knew before getting infected. Perhaps trying to understand why they can't help but act the way they do. And, maybe, find out what happened to them. I chose not to hide and give up. That is why I decided to go along with this group. Holding on to them I decided I would be just another anonymous. I think we have to go. What? He's right, we have no food. What are you saying? That they will eventually enter, and we have to go. Fuck. I'm leaving. Run! Run! Out, now! Hurry, go! I'll close up. Run! Mario. Guilt is the worst of sentences. It takes possession of our inner self, devouring and consuming us. We can't stop. We have 30 or 40 minutes of daylight at best. 5 minutes, please. Alright, 5 minutes. But, then, no excuses. You said we would be safe far from the cities. Where's that bloody town of yours? Don't step on the rats. Careful, they'll eat you. Let's go, you crackpot. Shit, I hope they don't come in. No, not here. Damn it, what do we do now? I don't know. - Shit! - What's wrong? I think they saw me. Come here. Let's go. Let's go. Run! But how many of you are there? That is a lot of questions for someone whose life has just been saved. I'm Jairo. You've already met everyone alive in the house. Come on, let's eat something. You're lucky. - In this town the only thing left is... - Rats. -Infected people. No one else? Some are left. We thought there would not be so many infected. I no longer think of those left, but of the ones arriving. Arriving how? Constantly. Well, I've introduced myself. They are Jana, Julia and Andrea. - She is NUT. - I'm Negra. Sofia. I want to go home. Now it's dinner time, Equis. It's very important not to make noise at night. And no light in the windows. They become active at dark. Noise and lights attract them. They have even climbed to the roofs. Anyway, you're safe here. You can eat now. Horse. Here we have eaten all sorts of food Anything? We do not waste anything here. Rabbits, birds, horses. Or dogs. Dogs? Fucking hell. This is not dog, right? What the hell are we eating? It doesn't look like horsemeat. Wild horse. I cut its throat myself with this knife. So, we can still hunt. Yes. But meat rots quickly. We heard on the radio that all animals are infected. Even domestic ones. No. Not all of them. The problem is that some animals are carriers and don't show it. Here some trusted too much and ate. And got infected. But it's not the same as infections between humans. It's harder to detect. Then what about the dog? No, no... I like dogs. There will always be food. But winter is long. And hard. I see you have weapons. A gunshot is heard 15 kilometers away. And within minutes, we have all the infected here. And they will come to get us. And that cannot happen. Weapons stay in the house. A group at 12 o'clock. Go right, come on. Come on. The latrines. Check the area before using them. Check the area? Rats. That's it. And there you have a bucket that must be filled with water. Don't forget to fill it if you use it. Where do you get the water? From a deposit in the upper part of town. But it is not drinkable. Some animals fell in. And what do we drink? Boiled water, or bottled. Distribute yourselves as you want. Come on, Equis. Excuse me, can I ask what...? Okay, forget it, thanks. What do you think? That they're good people, Jairo. Not what I expected to hear. God... Well, well... Mario? Come here. Can I pee? Good morning. Jam... The rest are already up? No. Equis! Have you seen him? What's wrong? I can't find him. I woke up and he was gone. Looks like your friend went on a walk. - We need to go get him. - Yes. But listen. The creatures are still strong. It's better if we go. Jana! I'll go with you. That's the spirit. But it's better if you stay and watch the house. Where could he be? Do you think they'll find him? You're not related. He is like my son. Yeah, but he is not. I lost my brother. And he was my actual brother. Your brother? What was his name? Pablo. The youngest. Pablo is a beautiful name. Well, I'm lucky I still have Jairo. Jairo is your brother. No... We couldn't find him. Not a trace of him. It's dangerous. He hasn't gone on the road, we would've seen him from the hill. Surely he is in the woods. - Let's go! - And that is really dangerous. Come here, it's better if you wait here. We're going. We're wasting our time. We have to find him. I have to find him. I can't lose anyone else. They're going into the woods. What? They're going into the woods. How do you know that? They took the church road, if we cut through the field we arrive before them. Come on! That's what we expected, right? Let's go! Andrea... Don't split up. Equis! Are you insane? What's wrong? They're watching us. I don' know what it is. Careful, Laura, they heard us. Fuck, get down, get down! Shit, don't move! No... I think I hit him. Do you know why they call me Negra? Because my heart is black. Black from putting up with a man who tortured me for years. And he didn't kill me. And no son of a bitch is going to. God! Oh my God... Let's go, let's go! Oh my God... Come on. I need hemostatic forceps. Needle and thread to stitch that wound. We have antibiotics but the rest... At the mall pharmacy there's everything. How far is that? About 80 kilometers away. We don't have time, we can try to control the bleeding. But we must take out the bullet and stitch. Tell me, if I take you to a pharmacy, would you find everything? I don't know, I guess. I'm going too. No, I need you here. You have to help me take him upstairs. Hey, we can drive if you want. No, it's okay. I don't get you, Laura. He fooled us too. And he was the one who kicked us out. Of my house, Laura, my house. Look... Jana is fucking shameful. But he deserved it too. Come on, Laura. You did what we wanted. Teach them a lesson. They took the car. Everyone? No, but they're going south for sure. South? Well, well... They're going to the mall. Do you know what that means? They will go through the Val road. And the regional road? No way. Dear friends, dear family, we are not scared of the journey but of not being able to leave on time. All our love. Go, go! Start the car, Julia! Go, Julia, they're coming! Hurry up, it's dark already. - These are not... - Calm down! - Who are they? - I know them. Put down the guns. What have you done? Is he dead? I'm sorry, Julia, but you have to give us the car. Who are these? -People -People, people, people - And Jana? - She's hurt. Lucky her. - Get out of the car! - I'm not getting out. Please. Everybody out! I don't know what's your deal. Don't let them mess with you! But the thing is if we don't get to the house soon that guy is going to die. It's very dark and Jairo is doing bad. If you're with them you're against us! I'm not against anyone! Laura. He's not okay. If we don't get there he won't make it through the night. Luis, what's wrong? Shit, Julia, start the car! Wait! Luis, shoot, for the love of God! Luis! Fuck! Julia, drive! Luis! Where is it? Fuck, shoot at them! Damn it, Luis. Hey, they're leaving! Don't shoot. You're just like them, Julia! Just like them! Come on, let's go. Who the fuck are they? Fuck! Shut up! We're almost in the town. Take the radio and put the 88 station. Which radio? That one. The radio! Tell them to open the gate. How the fuck does this work? Pass me the light. A bit higher. There. There you are. Water. Can you give me space? I'm going to stitch. Andrea, before I start, I would like to know what the fuck is happening in this house. Who are those people that stopped us? Where did you study medicine? I'm not a doctor. I'm a nurse. But a bright one. Okay, first finish, then I'll tell you everything. The lights. You can go to sleep. No, no... I'm fine. I'd rather stay here. I think he's doing worse. It's early to tell. The antibiotic has to kick in. Don't worry. That strange woman seemed to hide a lot more than she showed. My God, you got little to do. You don't eat meat? No. She's a vegetarian. She never eats meat. Tell me about your brother Pablo. I don't want to talk about it. Pablo was the best man in the world. Always caring, always kind. Better than all of us. And he was your brother. He was my husband. - We were married for 5 months... - Jairo will recover. Yes, he will, Maria is taking good care of him. You pray... You're awake! I heard you in my sleep. I was a priest. A time ago, in a school. What happened? Who did you leave? Forget it. Finally. - How are you? - He's got a fever, but he'll be fine. Good, good. Come on. Are you going to give me a kiss? Don't be a pussy. You're acting different. Don't talk bullshit. You're putting us in danger. I'm going to be part of the family. I don't agree, but it's your decision. But the junkie is useless. No. Not at all. Not at all? Negra. What? All these years we've been together why didn't you tell me about that guy? Did you believe all the bullshit the butcher said? What? It's a party. A couple's party. That war game crap. I don't buy it. I do. I don't trust Jana. I want to know what's behind that door. I'm taking care of that already. I want to get the radio. For what? What do you think? To talk to the others. I don't understand. Don't you see it? They're hiding something. And they don't want us to know. The others are key. Fuck, you're clueless. He hurt me. A lot. Don't look at me. His pastime was... sticking needles in me, putting out cigarettes on my body. Also putting everything he could find in my mouth in my ass, my cunt... But it's over. I won. He was asleep and I hit him on the head with a hammer as hard as I could. When he woke up, he didn't understand why he was tied up and his face was wet. Even when I cut his balls off with garden shears he said nothing. That son of a bitch talked all those years and I didn't. And he didn't know what to say. I made him swallow them, you know? I covered his mouth and nose until he swallowed them. Then I slit his throat. God... I hadn't seen so much blood since the pig slaughter. These last 15 years in prison have been great. That's why I didn't tell you. I didn't want to remember it. That house... hid dead bodies in every single room. She's coming down. Is it enough? Yes, I've sedated him to sleep for 10 hours. Not too much, right? You're an asshole. I'm a professional. Hey, come on... We want them to wake up. - Nur. - What? The keys. Which keys? Weren't you supposed to take them from Andrea? Ah, yes. Okay. They're hiding something. The horse at the very least. What? I think we're going to find the horse. I'm fucking sick of you! Open the goddamn door already! Negra, shine the light here. Looks like they have been busy raiding the pharmacy. Holy shit... Fentanyl. This is pure gold. Painkillers. Morphine, probes... Pure gold. Holy shit, it must be an infected. No, it looks like something else. God! No... Equis! Fuck... fuck! He is drugged. But, why? Why do they have him here? I think this is your wild horse. I realized the end was near... It was time to discover... the purpose of my journey. Sofia. If we can get him out of here, could he survive? He's done. Could he survive? It is best to give him an injection. Sofia! Will you shut the fuck up? I've told you I'm a professional. You hear me? You ignorant bitch. A professional. What did you say? What did you say? Fucking bitch! Okay, enough! Stop! That's it. Do you remember? The day we found you there starving, uh? What do you mean? That I didn't want to. You didn't want to what? Help you. I knew it as soon as I saw you. You were not trustworthy. But they did it. So, again... If we could get him out of here... would he survive? They keep him alive with fluids and antibiotics. Morphine for the pain. If we can lower the morphine, enough to hold him up so that you can get him on his feet. Maybe. Then do it. I have a radio. What? I want it to talk to the others. They used to live together. Maybe... maybe they have one. It's logical, isn't it? Yeah, it's possible. Negra, go get a knife from the kitchen. Who, me? Okay, I'll go. Sofia, get him off all the drugs. I need him conscious before sunrise. Tomorrow we will contact the others. By the way, I'm a priest. Sure, Father. Alright, all clear then. Why are they doing this? How can they? Calm down, Nur. He was looking for his mother. What? Equis. He took me to the school that day to look for his mother. Luisa. His mother was Luisa, the school's cook. Equis' name is Nelson. Nelson. Nur, let's go upstairs. You need to rest. Yes. Yes, let's go. Where is Jana? She didn't come last night. She slept in the kitchen by the fire. She's acting weird. You didn't get her pregnant, did you? I'll fix your bed. Well... That would complicate everything. Hello? Can anyone hear me? Hello? Is anyone there, please? Shit, shit, shit... Hello? Is anyone there? Hello? We need help, hello? Anyone? Hello? Is anyone there, please? Hello, who is this? Listening. Over. Yes, yes Hello, hello! I'm Sofia. I'm trapped in a town. In a house. With some friends. We need help, please. We need help. We have nothing to lose. And what if it's a trap? Didn't you hear her voice? She was terrified. I want my house back, Sara. I am willing to do anything but, if they find us, we are dead. So I'm not going to think twice. Hey! Here you have the gate key. Get the car and wait for me on the other side. What's going on here? Jesus. You can't control this one or what? Well, sorry, it is what it is. We will have to go hunting. Aren't you having dinner? And Jana? We still have lots to do. Yes, we have to finish in the kitchen. They know, they know... Shut up, you idiot! You're like a bird of ill omen. Always bothering everyone. Let her be. Do you think they suspect anything? It is already done. Be careful with the third step. And don't make noise. Don't forget about Andrea. Jairo is dangerous, my sister-in-Iaw manipulates him. But she... she's evil. She's no longer your sister-in-Iaw. Sorry I... I can't get used to it. When the time comes, you have to hide. I need to know that you'll be safe. You'll have to help me. I don't have much experience. Take off your clothes. Take all my clothes off. Why are you doing this? Because I like you. Well, because... I don't mind if you think about him. I really don't. Think about him if you want. I'm going down. Wait. I've put you in danger with no need. Right, it's best to put the injection. You're an idiot. No, you are not going to piss me off again. I know what I'm doing. I know why I'm doing it. There was no hope for those people. I only eased their pain. You don't have to convince me. - Jairo is under control? - Yes. I gave him the infusion. But then I heard his bitch of a sister. I don't know if he drank it. And it distracted him because I thought he was talking to a man. Mario was downstairs. She showed up alone. It was weird. I can't take it anymore, I'm going. Wait! Fuck. You're not going to eat us. You're not going to eat us. You're not going to eat us. You're not going to eat us. You're not going to eat us. You're not going to eat us. You're not going to eat us, you're not going to eat us. Why? You're not going to eat us. It's me, Sofia. No! Sofia! Sofia! Nur, why did you do this? It's me. Sofia. Jana. Mario, what is it? I heard a scream. I need you to do something for me. Do what? There's a gun. Just before Andrea's room. In a gap. Don't wake her up. There is a curtain and it's just behind it, next to the wall. Don't wake her up. Okay, I'll go. Mario. We are almost family now. What do you mean? You live in my house. You eat my food. You fuck my girls. Jairo, I... Hey, don't be silly. It's okay. Julia is a free woman. She can do whatever she wants. Turn that off. Good. Very good. That right there... is it a body? It looks like it. I would say there's even 2. At the gate there's another one. What do we do? We wait. Disgusting, it smells so bad! Pablo. Jairo. What was that? Help! I think it sounded in here. I don't think so. Yes, it did No, Mario, no. - Infected? - No. I don't think so. Besides, the snow absorbs our footsteps. - Wait. - What? I'll wear your mask and you'll wear mine. Why does it matter? Let's go. Is it open? Fuck... What did I tell you? I didn't want to see you here anymore. And what are you doing with the masks? - What the fuck are you doing with the masks? - Protection. Protection? - Protection from what? - The infected. Take off the fucking mask. I sad take off the fucking mask! Laura, there's always room for you here. Who the hell was it? Don't worry, we'll find out. Laura, take off your mask and let's go inside. You got the target wrong, motherfucker. Fuck you. And now what? You'll kill us in cold blood? Pick them up! Son of a bitch! Shit! I'll be coming for you. What the hell is happening? I don't know, we heard screaming. Mario went down to find out. Sara... Sarita... I Sara! Always after my cock, Sara. In the end you chose the posh one. Sara... What happened? What happened? He just killed one of them in front of me Cold-blooded. And Sofia? Jairo did it. He's about to test my shotgun. Facing him won't work. You catch him off guard. And Andrea? I don't know. Negra, I need you to calm down. Nur and Sofia are dead. Son of a bitch! I'll beat the shit out of him, I swear. Wait... We don't know if it was him. Come on, let's go up. Sarita... Sara. Bitch! If she is in the room, what do we do with her? We tie her up and we... Kill her. Or she will. Are there more guns in the house? Let's go. Where is that bitch? Nur was right. She suspected something. In the basement. I'm not going down there. Under the bed. Keep quiet. What's that? I don't know. Should I turn it on? Slowly. What are you doing, you bitch! Are you okay? Did they bite you? I know a place. What? A place to hide. Let's go. Wait. There could be more infected people. Julia! Hurry, come here! Let's go. Come on. Let's go! Mario. We'll be safe. Where exactly are we going? To a safe place. Careful. Careful. Come on, we're almost there. God... It's smells even worse. Julia. Are you sure that...? Come here. Easy, Pablo. Julia, that's not Pablo. It is Pablo and shut up. I don't eat people, Mario. I help. Now it's time to make sacrifices. What do you mean? Julia. Listen to me. - No, now we make sacrifices. - Listen. Now we make sacrifices! Pablo! Kill him, Pablo! Pablo, kill him! Kill him! It's me, Julia. Pablo. Come on. Pablo, please. Pablo. It's me. Pablo. Pablo, it's Julia. Son of a bitch! Jairo! Do you hear me? Come get me! Do you hear me? Son of a bitch. Mario. The woman who returned to the school that day... she was no longer our Luisa. I wasn't me either. She found me. But she didn't find them. Mario. What did you do to the children? Why did you kill them? Why... did you kill them? Don't say anything, Mario. Come with us. Don't say anything.
