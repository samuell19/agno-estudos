Subtitles by explosiveskull Come on, come on, come on. Pick up. Mom, where are you? It's almost 11 o'clock. Why aren't you home yet? I've called you like five times. I-I really, I don't know what to do about this bite. Do I go to the hospital? What do I do? Just, just call me back. What? All right, can you smile towards camera? Uh, it looks like you're in pain. - Really? - All right, whatever. Just be yourself. - Okay. - Relax. Shake it out. Wait, we haven't gone over what-what-what do I say? Just tell them who you are. But remember, the world's watching so make it good. Who I am. Right. Who am I? Who am I? Oh, just a philosophy, Zach. I know who I am, and it sucks. Plus, the longer you talk the sooner they're going to click away to the nutshot videos. Ha ha. Hey, guys. How you doin'? Welcome to our town. Podunk, Missouri. It's not actually called Podunk. But this is the place they were thinking of when they came up with the name "Podunk". It's 60 miles of forest between here and the next shithole over. The kind of town where people don't even lock their doors at night. Yeah, we're officially too boring for crime. What's up? I'm Randy Foster. And I'm Zach Henderson. So this is what we're going to be doing. We're going to be flying under the radar with these sweet little Bluetooth cameras that have kickass low light lenses. And you can buy these from affiliate links so don't be a freeloader 'cause we need cash to get out of here. - Yeah. - But back to business. So we edit everything here on Zach's sweet rig. Up top. And then we add some of my bangin' FX and boom, it's on the wild, wild web. So we can show you the real "Multon: Uncovered." That is the captain of the high school football team. Have a good day. The sheriff is literally letting him buy beer. Um, things to do here. Uh, you can wake up, eat, go to sleep. It's pretty exciting. So yeah. This is Multon. All 2.5 blocks of it. And this is our cast of crazy characters. Hey, guys! - Hey, Pastor Greg. - Hey. We're doing a production of "Jesus Christ Superstar" down at the church. Oh, that sounds great. Are you guys interested in trying out? Uh, I'm... There will be girls. Maybe. Maybe. I'll see you there. - Okay. - Okay. All right. - Definitely not. - I'm not gonna do it. No. I bet you're wondering why are they showing us this squat, boring ass building? Well, that's because this building is the best thing that ever happened to Multon. High speed internet so we're not totally cut off from the rest of the planet. And so you can see people like us because we're awesome. Dude, check it out. Spring has sprung. Miss Bissette's got her short shorts on. Oh, hey, Zach. Hey, Randy. Hey, Miss Bisette. Come here just a second. Do you boys see those? Those little bugs were all over the place. What, uh, what are they? No idea. Well, they just started showing up last week. Let me go! I'll see you boys later. Let me go! Hey, Mrs. Peterson! You're not my mommy! So that's our, uh, resident hippie indie book store owner chick. She pops out a kid and becomes Ms. PTA Zombie. See this is the point of our show: to show the people of Multon the way they really are. - That was pretty good. - Yeah? Yeah, it sounded, it sounded smart. Great game today. Hey, see you later. Dude. It's really what's goes on. - Text you. Bye. - Hey. - Hey, Zach. - Hey. Wait, what are those? Are you guys spy-caming people? No. No, uh, no. It's-it's for our web show. Oh, web show. It's like TMZ kind of stuff. - But it's more than that. - Mm-hmm. We are showing the world real small town life. Well, maybe you guys can make it a reality show and you can both get rich and date starlettes. - Hey, Prince. - Hey, guys. - Hey. - Joey. Sweetie. - Hey, Zach. - Hey, Joey. How'd Kayla play, Zach? Like a rock star. Good. Maybe when she gets to Northwestern she can carry on the family tradition. Have you decided where you're going yet, Zach? Um, not really. I'm probably just gonna keep running my computer repair biz out of my house. Well, that's nice. Well, I'm sure it'll make your parents very happy. All right, this is getting nauseatingly mundane and, um, Zach, he needs some drama for his new show. - Show? - Yeah. He's got a new show. Hey. - Look at that. - You guys think my dad's normal? He's secretly got five wives. Five? I can barely handle one. - Hey! - Dad! Wait a minute! Come on, Kayla. Dog pound. Let's be on it. Bye, guys. See you guys. Dude, you have to ask her out. I can't. I have known her since the fourth grade. It'd be weird, right? No, you've been in denial since the fourth grade. Dude, she's not just a buddy. She was a buddy, I'm a buddy. And I don't look nearly as good in shorts. Seriously, you just got to grow a pair and do it. This is your last chance. In three months, she's outta here. Uh, I'll walk you through it. Okay, ready? - Okay. - Okay, so you're going to want to open up your browser. Okay. And into the web address type 192. One nine two. Dot 168 dot zero dot one. Okay. Enter. Oh. Huh. We should, uh, try to hit the Lindsey Trail sometime this summer. Yeah. The Lindsey Trail. - Yeah. - Yeah, Randy would just love that. - Oh. - All the wood ticks and the poison ivy. - Randy. - Mmm, right up his alley. Oh my, God, speaking of poisonous bugs and ticks and plants and things, Oh! Look where I'm going! Peru? Yeah, my mom and dad got it for me. I leave two weeks after graduation. It's like a live jungle, you know. That's awesome, Kayla. It's going to be insane. Thank you. - Ah! - Oh my... Jesus. You goofball. Hey, Zach. What's up, little man? Wait, what are you supposed to be? Some sort of monster? I'm not a monster. I'm a mutant. I see. He's a mutant. Oh, I see it now. Okay. - Okay, okay, okay, okay. - No, no. I'm a lot stronger than you. - You mess with me, buddy, you're gonna get it. - Okay. Okay! Take your mask. You'll see him on holidays. Yeah. Wait for it. Jesus, listen to you. I don't have to put up with this shit! I'm out of here! Oh no, no, no, no! Oh my God. My trash symphony. I saw Helen today. She's been dating someone online, but I'm afraid it's going nowhere. He's in Florida and that's just such a long ways. Well, you can't blame her. There's not much left around here. So how is Kayla, Zach? Beautifully subtle segue, Mom. Yeah, how is she, Zach? She's a nice girl. Just, I'm saying, she's a nice girl. I know, she's a nice girl. You're staying for dinner, right, Randy? Yeah, sure. Oh, I cannot believe you're filming us. We are so boring. No, you guys are the most normal part of this messed up town. Well, thank you, Randy. Say, where do they make those little cameras, Randy? Oh, right. The same place my job went. - Woo! - Sweet! Nailed that! Acapulco. I can become a bartender. Last week it was Monaco. Yeah, but I love Mexican food. Plus, we could be called the Dos Amigos. Ah, I can't leave my mom to take care of my dad by herself. Dude, I love your parents. They're awesome. But you got to start living your life, man. Plus... What the hell is that? Mrs. Bisette? Mrs. Bisette? Hello? Mrs. Bisette? Holy Jesus. Call the cops. Sheriff's office. Hi, we're at Mrs. Bisette's house. Something's wrong. Hello? They hung up. Really? Come on, Randy. Oh, shit. - Randy? - What? Let's go. Hey, hey. It's-it's-it's okay, it's okay. What happened? Something bit me. Something bit me. Something bit me. Something bit me. Are you going to be okay? Come on. Shit! Whoa, what are you doing? We have to find it. What? Why? It might have rabies. Come on! Dude, where'd it go? Right there! Get it! Get it! I'm trying. I'm trying. Get down. What the hell is it? That's, I think it's a rat. Pastor Greg? But why do you have to go away so much? But I'm just so tired of being left alone. I miss you so much. - Hey, assholes! - Shit! Leave them alone. Shut your mouth. All I was doing was buying some beer. You had to put it online. Listen, we got something to do so we're just gonna go. I don't care! My dad took my Xbox! - I don't care about your Xbox! - Shut up! All right, all right, let's calm down. - Shall we? - What the hell? I was just playing with them. Remember what it was like back on the team, Josh? Well, back on the team I remember we could take a joke. - Let's go. - Go on. - Get out of here. - Come on. Sure. Thanks. Well, you might have funny videos, but nobody likes a snitch. Listen, we have something we need to show you. What was that? Are you gonna be okay? Come on, let's go. I'm sorry, I don't even know what this is. What is this? It bit Mrs. Bisette. Okay, then why didn't she come to us herself? Hmm? What? Come on, Pastor Greg is going around throwing rats in people's houses. Done. Mmm. Okay. You know what? Leave me out of your bullshit web series. All right? If you guys want to become Hollywood assholes, Photo shopping this nonsense, whatever. But leave me out of it. And for that matter, leave Pastor Greg out of it as well. He's a good man. I'd ended up in juvie if it weren't for him. Got it? Yeah. Got it. - How could Josh not believe us? - Because it's insane. We're saying that Pastor Greg is throwing rats into people's houses. Yeah, but the video is crazy. I mean why would Pastor Greg do it? I don't know. Let's ask. What the hell is that? Come on. Pastor Greg? Can I help you boys? So? That's you. I don't think so. No, we saw you. Look Pastor Greg, we do not want to get you into any trouble here. You boys aren't going to get me in any trouble. Your mom is a slut. And your dad is a junkie. Jesus Christ, what kind of person says that? No need to raise your voice. Is there a problem here? No, we're cool. Dude, what the hell was that? I don't know. I think we should post this stuff on our channel. I mean Josh didn't believe us, but maybe somebody will. Oh, shit. No service. You? Nothing. So we were wondering if you had seen Pastor Greg around your house last night? Why? Okay, we think that he's the one who threw the thing at the house that bit you. Yeah. Oh, I wasn't bit. Do you see a bite? I'm sorry, I-I could have sworn that you were sitting in your closet. No. No, we have a video. We saw you screaming. So? Uh, uh... What-what was that? You can come to my bedroom with me. Both of you. - Holy shit. - Dude. What the hell was that? Wait. Hold on. Something was going on in there. Yeah, no shit. First Pastor Greg, now her. Here's what I don't get. Who heals that fast? Randy, look. - What are we doing? - We're just looking around. - What's that? - There's a guy in there. What? Shh! He's tied up to the bed. Oh! Go! Oh! Go! You two should not have been looking in her window. This is none of our concern. That's not the point, okay? She's being weird, Mom. Look at that. It, but it wasn't just her. It's Pastor Greg was acting like a freak. Everyone in the church was just like sitting there acting really weird. Maybe it's like mass hysteria or something, something in the air. Look, I know this town is boring and I know you can't wait to get out. It's not about that. But you're not gonna make anything better by imaging things. It just is what it is. Look, either the entire town's going crazy or we are. Look. Is that...? Dylan. That's his tat. But how are there two of him? It's my dad. He's been acting really strange. I don't know, it's... He was fine a few days ago, but now it's like, it's like there's no feeling in him. It's-it's like he's-he's acting like my dad. Look, I know that this sounds crazy, but it's like he's a different person. You know, he has the same face, and-and-and-and the same voice, but he's... He's not the same inside. Am I losing my mind? - No. - No. We've seen the same thing all over town. Yeah. There's a bunch of people that are acting different. How about your mom? I don't know. I mean I haven't seen her since this morning. We need to go to the police. We talked to Josh. He didn't seem too amused by it. Why? Our credibility ain't so hot after we posted our web show. Nobody believes us. Okay, well will you guys come with me? To help me find my mom and to get Joey and-and you can record it, you know, with your cameras and then we can get people to believe us. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's a really good idea. All right, stand up. We're going to put this camera on you. Evening. Hi. Hey, Mrs. Fritz. Nice night. Mom? Dad? If you'll be my friend I'll show you... Oh... Children want to see everything that's goin' on. 'Cause we got a lot to say. Hey! Knock, knock. Who's there? Anybody home? Get it? Anybody home? Knock, knock. - Want to hear another one? - Dad? What are you doing? Everything's fine, Kayla. Um, uh, Kayla, I need to use the restroom real quick. Yeah. Yeah, use the one upstairs. Okay, great. Mrs. Shepard? Mrs. Shepard? Mrs. Shepard? Mrs. Shepard? My mom says hi. She's good. Where's Zach? Oh, he's probably just, he'll be down in a second. Mrs. Shepard? Mrs. Shepard? Joey. Daddy's scaring me. - What are you doing up here? - I thought Mommy was up here. She-she has this liver disease. Where's Zach? I'm sure he'll be right back down. He should be here. Uh, I mean it's just like, he's just going to the bathroom right now. It'll take him, just give him like a second. And he'll be back. He's probably... - He's going to the bathroom. - It's not... - He's going to the-he's going to the bathroom. - He's going to the bathroom. Hey, Zach, did you fall in? Joey, go to your room and hide. Okay. I'm going downstairs. Zach? Coming! What's taking so long, Zach? Just a minute. Uh, just a second! Zach? Why are you in here? Um, I'm actually really sorry. The, it was the, uh, first bathroom that I saw. We really have to be going. Excuse me. Zach? Zach! Hey. - We have to keep going. - What happened? What happened? What happened? - You don't want to see it. - Would you look at me, please? You don't want to see it. Give me your phone. Zach? Oh, Jesus. Kayla, I'm so sorry. They're killing people now. Oh my, God. Oh my, God, wait, Joey's in there. We have to go get Joey. We will. We will. How? Pastor Greg and the Sheriff are in on this. Jesus Christ. You swear that this is real? - 'Cause if you guys are punking me... - It's real. There's absolutely nothing up there. He must have moved her body. You saw it! You saw it on the video! Why did you kill her? Calm down. Look, I do need an explanation as to what is on that video. Is there a problem, officer? Mom? Mom. You-you're not my mom. I'm sorry, Deputy Haywood. We've been dealing with Kayla's mental illness for some time now. There was a video. False. Just like their show. You know I would have expected more professionalism from you, Josh. Sorry for the disturbance. We'll be on our way. No! No, no, no. Come on, Joey. Come on. No! I want to go with Kayla. He wants to come. Come on. Just come with us. It doesn't matter what he wants. He belongs to me. What are you? Go to your room. There is no way in hell that I'm going anywhere. I am your father. You have to do what I say! You're just gonna let her go? Yeah. You know, I think that is gonna be best. Yeah, you all played me for a fool with that little freak show back there. Jesus Christ! I mean gee, really, I should take - you both in for filing a false police report. - No, you don't, You don't even see what's going on right in front of you. I don't-you know what I see? I see what you're doing to that girl. Okay? Don't be those guys. Tell me that that all felt right in there, Deputy. Josh, how's the Sheriff? You know what, Zach? I don't have time for this. We need him. Dude, this is way bigger than this Podunk sheriff's department. We need to get Joey. Right. We get our parents, then we get Joey, and get our footage uploaded. Once people see what's going on here, they'll send people to help. And we get the hell out of here. We'll get him. Come on. I don't get it. I'm trying to upload my footage, but there's still no service. Randy, do you got anything? No. Kayla, what about you? You know what? Just Randy and I should go in. Fine. I'll see if I can find your mom. Thank you. Does anyone ever work in that barn? No. Dad? Dad? Hello, boys. Where's mom? We should, uh, get out of town pretty quick. There's some weird stuff going on. Zach. What are you talking about? Oh, God. Where's Mom? Everything's fine. - What did you do to Mom? - It's not him. Come on, we need to go. What are you doing? Wait! No, no, no! No, no, no! No, no, no! - Hey! - No! What was that? Oh, shit! Not funny. Dude, turn the light. Who's there? Mom? No! Randy, are you okay? I think something bit me. Are you okay? Oh, shit! Where'd it go? Randy, be careful. Zach? What? What is it? What the hell? Oh, shit! Mom? No. Mom! Mom! Get off her! Get off! Zach, that wasn't me. I had to kill her. Zach? No! Come on. You guys, we gotta go! They're coming back. Come on! Oh, let's go. Come on, hurry! Look at that. What happened? We gotta go. Zach, we gotta go, okay? How do we know it's him? I mean we don't, but who else is there? You got a shitty poker face, Randy. What were you going to do with that? Yeah. Come on. So we know we're all right, but... All right. Oh, Jesus. Oh, my God. Yeah. So one of those things bit me, but I kept my eyes open. We are going to need to take it with us though. What? Why? Oh, you're still filming, right? - Yeah. - So we take that thing and the footage to the FBI. That'll get them to move their asses. Yes. I'm sorry though. I should have believed you guys. What in the hell are they? I don't know. Do you guys think they might be aliens? Here's what we do know. First they bite you. Then they turn into you. But not right away. It's more like a copy. And they act like an animal. And then they, they... Well, maybe they bite you to get your DNA and then they clone you. You know, but the clone, it doesn't have any of the original memories so it has to like find you and just-and just take them. There's someone out there. - What? - What do you mean? Oh, shit! Shit! Oh, my God. All right, get down, get down! What the hell was that? You should call for backup. Let's just get out of here. Get it! Randy, he's here for you! Move away! Move away! Go, go, go! Where? Where? Where? They're here! Josh? Josh? Shit. Randy, stay away from that window. Shit. There's too many! They're surrounding us. They're surrounding us. Oh, shit! Whoa! Hang on! Hang on! They're gonna flip us! Hang on! Go! Oh my, God. Zach! No! No! Don't! Don't! Josh, no! Randy. No, Randy! Hey! Of all the towns on this planet, you guys chose this shithole to take over? God, you're a bunch of idiots! But you know what? You can have it. Fuck this! Over here! Fuck this! Come on, this way! Zach, Zach, we gotta go. We gotta go. Come on. I'm okay. They're still blocking the signal out here. There's a delivery van at my mom's shop. You know, we could go get it and get-and get Joey and just get out of here. And in Springfield, they'll have service. We can just upload our video there. Yeah. Come on, Kayla. Slow down, slow down. They key's under the flower pot. And then inside, it's under the cash register. Okay. Go ahead. Joey. No, no, no. No. I just want to go home. It's okay, Tyler. You're just gonna feel a little pinch. Okay. See? Now that wasn't so bad. And now I'll love you even more. Stop! Please, don't do it! I don't-I don't want it! Joey, run! Joey, Joey! Get out of here, Joey! Joey, run! Go to the cabin! Go! Yeah, go! Joey, go! Run! Joey, go! No! Get in! Come on! Go, go, go! Go, go! Come on! Go, go! Joey... Joey got away. That's great. I told him to go to the cabin. But he got away. Let's go get him and get the hell out of here, okay? Oh God, you got bit. No, no, no, no. When I get replaced is it going to have my feelings? Is it going to have my memories? Will I remember you? Don't think like that, Kayla. Because we are gonna make it. Yeah, but it'll find me. It found Randy. We are going to make it. We're gonna get help. We have everything recorded on our phones. We can show them what happened here. We're gonna stop it. Ah! Zach, come on, we gotta get it! Come on! Kayla! Come on, it's gone. No, it's-Zach, you were bitten, we have to-if we can't... Let's-let's go to the cabin. Get Joey. - Get down! - Shit. Keep going. We have to go. This way. Get down! Oh, my God. We're not gonna make it out. Zach, we have to go get Joey. We can't. I'm sorry. But Kayla, if this spreads there won't be anyone else for us to call for help. But we can make it to the cable company. If we can get there, we can upload our video straight into the backbone of the internet to the entire world. They can't block that. So we get the message out. Yeah. Come on. Let's go. Come on. Down here, down here. Come on. Hello, Zach. Randy. I thought I might find you here. We used to go fishing here. Do you remember? Yeah. I remember. We never caught anything. Why did we do it? 'Cause catching something was never the point. Right. Where's Kayla? We lost each other. Right. Kayla never did know the woods like you and I. Did she? We'll find her together. Just like old times. Yeah. Just like old times. We went through it all together, didn't we? I don't know what I would have done without you. Zach. Zach. Zach, Zach, Zach, look at me. Zach, look at me. Zach, look at me. We got to go. We got to go. Okay? We gotta go. Come on. Come on. Come on. Right there. We can make it to that door. Are you ready? - Let's do it. - Okay. This way. Can we just upload from one of these offices? No, we need to find the main trunk terminal. It's on the front, right there. Right here. Hey. Hey. Hey, we gotta go. - We gotta go. Zach, we gotta go. - Okay, go. Come on, come on, come on. Come on. There, come on. Come on. Go, go, go, go, go. - Bring up the footage from your phone. - Okay, yeah. - Upload the footage onto the terminal. - Okay. Okay, where? YouTube? Facebook? Vimeo? Everywhere. Okay. Come on. Come on. That's it. What? What? What? Get footage of you talking on screen. Okay. Hey, Zach. Hey. Got it. Do you trust me? Yeah. Take a deep breath, okay? The kind of place where people don't even lock their doors at night. I'm Randy Foster. And I'm Zach Henderson. I know. See you later. ...what we're trying to do: show the people of Multon the way they really are. Ah, who I am. Right. Okay. Here we go. Who am I? Who am I? Joey. Okay. Kayla! Oh, God. What? What? That... That's not possible. They're everywhere. We weren't the first town. We were the last. Pastor Greg? Pastor Greg? Can I help you, boys? Subtitles by explosiveskull
