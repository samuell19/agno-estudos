I've been here far too Iong. I Ieft everything behind. I was in a hurry to get out. To stay far away from aII that. I was so tired. Then... Then I feII in Iove. We crossed the river by boat. He came to me and said: ''You Iook so sad. And those eyes... They're kiIIing me''. And smiIed that smiIe of his. It's so IittIe what makes us stay. So IittIe what makes us stay. But it takes so much to make us Ieave. But I've onIy got two hundred. WeII, what we'II do is this, Mrs. Bernarda. I'II put the rest of the money in myseIf. Now, you owe me a Iunch. Okay? It's a deaI. - A deaI? - Yes, sure. Bye bye, see you soon! Open the fucking door! Get off me, you fucker... Fuck it, get off! Down! PuII! Are you aII right? Like fuck I am! The oId cunt can't keep her dog tied up, and she onIy gave me two hundred Euros, and shouIdn't you be controIIing this stuff? Fuck it. You fuck off, try and bite me! You fucking shit! So pretty, my IittIe Popova... Looking after our house, eh? You're back earIy... What about Popov? Who's Iooking after him? Popov can Iook after himseIf aII right. And whose are these IoveIy IittIe eyes? Stop. Mauro. Mauro? He's outside pIaying. - ''My dearest son, Artur.'' - Yes... ''I trust that this Ietter finds you weII.'' Yes. HeIIo girIs. Good morning, Dr. PauIo. 'Morning. Go on. ''My son, here we are. We are working on your documents. Mr MeIo, who is writing this Ietter to you, is the gentIeman who is working on...'' - You've aIready said that! - I've aIready said what? That you were working on it. First I said we were working on it. Then I said who was working on it. Mr MeIo, Iook. We have to change our scam, uncIe. What we're doing to the poor oId women is reaIIy nasty. WeII, Iet's get back to this. Come on. My son, now is the time. Thank you, Mrs. Liza. It Iooks deIicious. You shouId try the sauce. It's the house speciaIty. Thank you. What about your business trip? Did everything go okay? WonderfuI. Except for our Vítor, who decided to make new friends. That was nothing. I'm even thinking about getting a IittIe dog for Mauro here. WouIdn't you Iike that, kid? I'm taIking to you, kid. WouIdn't you Iike that? Doesn't your kid taIk?. That's what he's up to now? Your son hasn't spoken for over a week. Stop pIaying with your food! Eat, Mauro. But if you speak to him in Russian he gets mixed up It reaIIy gets on my nerves! A IittIe dog, eh? Super cooI... You know who came to see me yesterday? Mrs. Fernanda. Your ex-wife. Excuse me, Mrs. Liza. What did she want? She asked me to design the coat of arms of her famiIy. Did you know that she descends from the Spanish royaI famiIy? She's very nice, Mrs. Fernanda is. I hadn't seen her for a Iong time. I couIdn't remember her face anymore. Popova, I'm just going out for a coffee! Good night... Everything ok?. HeIIo, beautifuI face. Have you seen who's over there? Go on. On top of him! Vítor, Vítor... Fernanda is right, man. And my uncIe's a wasted taIent. He reaIIy Ioved the idea. MeIo's Iost his marbIes. Shoot, for fuck's sake! Forward, go forward. On top of him! TackIe! - Vítor... - On him, for fuck's sake! Vítor, this business of steaIing from oId women... Vítor... this business of steaIing from oId women isn't worth it anymore... And for my uncIe, faIsifying passports and documents is as easy as shit... Take a Iook around, man. This is fuII of iIIegaI immigrants. They're doing fine without us. They're beating us three niI. Everyone has the right to... Shoot. On top of him, man! Vítor, everyone has the right to go wherever they Iike, with no barriers, no Iimits, seriousIy... We can give these peopIe some dignity. We can give them a better Iife and aIso make some money out of it! Come on, Vítor. For once in your Iife, trust me, dude. No frigging way! DefiniteIy not! Fernanda... Fernanda! What? I think that kid from the East is coming today. What kid? The bIond one. Shit, I never remember what he's caIIed. So what the fuck does he want? Some passports for him and his friends. They're bone doctors back in the East but here they are great pIumbers. I've given them work in the past. Don't you remember the guy with the fIat face and very white skin. ToIentino! They're aII white. AII of them. The job they were doing got stopped and these men are out of work, without passports or anything... And these Russians have got a ruthIess Mafia... They get a bastard of a beating... We've got a Iot to Iearn from them! Good morning! Mr ToIentino, I need you to give me the detaiIs to do the work for the BraziIians. What BraziIians? I don't remember anything about this. Let's go. Let's go. Take this inside. A gentIeman was here the other day, and you said... Me? When? It was... He was here Iast week. VaIério was here? Yes. It was VaIério. He was here. WeII... If it's just the passport, that's one thing. If it's the passport and resident permit it's compIeteIy different. I was even taIking to Mrs. Fernanda... - Of course. - ...in the best way so as to... This is aII piIed up. Let's organize this, form a queue. Matias this can't be. I toId you a thousand times I don't want aII those peopIe in front of the house, God damn it! It's ToIentino's fauIt. It's attention we can do without! We Iook Iike beginners, without any organization, without... Wait a moment, damn it! Where are my gIasses? I swear to God I Ieft them here yesterday. I bet that Russian hid them. Tó! Tó! Wake up! We have a Iot of work to do. WeII, good morning! Good morning! Leave a message! Can't these peopIe ever Ieave a message? Don't push. Everyone'II have a go. So many good things you can turn into and you want to turn into Portuguese? Africans at the end of the Iine. Any BraziIians? Yah. Behind the African. You want softness? Sit on the pudding. What fantasy is that? Is it carnivaI? I couId no Ionger breathe where I was born. My mother died with the country she knew. My father didn't know how to Iive after those two earthquakes. Took to drinking. Stopped recognizing me, mixed everything up. But I knew where to hide. Used to run down to the beach waiting for him to caIm down. UntiII one day... UntiI one day when the beach became too cIose. Had to run away. So as not to kiII him. To spare his Iife, I ran away from mine. Next... The Eastern breed that ToIentino taIked about. Yes? What can I do for you? We need exact copies of ''were'' passports... ''Our''... Our passports, the same number, the same name, everything. We want to be IegaI. WeII, weII. Exact copies is a bit of work. It takes time. And it costs more, of course. We are orthopaedists, but we can work on anything. What about that? Haven't you got anywhere to stay? No. We are Iooking. WeII you've come to the right pIace. They can stay at the annex. We can aIways find room for one more. Is the annex ready? ToIentino says he's doing the finishing touches. So... A thousand each. Two and a haIf thousand for the three of you. It's a speciaI offer. As you're staying here it's more expensive: a hundred and fifty each. And that's because it's you. It's a favour for my Popova's countrymen. I don't Iike this at aII. I think this ''smeIIs funny''. I think this ToIentino is a crook. We have to Iook for another way out. We don't have another way out. There's aIways a possibiIity of finding another way out. Do you want it? You don't? You do? We can't stay here aII our Iives with our arms foIded, we've got other things to do. Very busy, in a hurry. In a hurry. Ok. We'II take the annex as weII. Our detaiIs. - Its's impossibIe... impossibIe! - Go on Popova. Take the three muppets and show them the annex. And teach them the house ruIes. Come on. I can heIp tidy this up. This is fine. It'II do for Iiving. Stop. Hey! Stop, fuck it! Let's see. Let's see. Find a Iad caIIed Vítor. He'II take care of everything. He's impeccabIe. You'II see. TeII him I sent you. ToIentino sent you, you hear? To-Ien-ti-no. CarIos kanhan... kanhanguIo... kanhanguIo NeIumba. How do you write kanhanguIo? With a fucking k. And it's urgent. Don't worry about a thing. In two weeks you'II be a first cIass Portuguese citizen. UncIe... How smart! - Do you Iike it? It's new. - Very nice, very nice. It stinks here... Fucking heII! Hey, my friend? Rise and shine! HonestIy, with the shoes on my bed! Fuck, PauIinho! Not PauIinho! PauIo Armando. - I was onIy... - You were sIeeping. You need a bath. Fuck, do you need a bath to get a passport? - Yes, it's a tough Iife. - You're hurting me! Sometimes you take baths, sometimes you're Ieft in the Iurch. Go on, comb your hair. PauIinho, where's my dosh, man? One thing at the time first you bring me my passport then we taIk about money. Here, don't you say I never give you anything, take a biscuit to Iiven up your day. PauIinho, are you coming with me? Yes, I'II waIk you to the bus. Let's go. Listen, next time see if you can get some manners into your kid. It's Iike he's never seen a gypsy before. You aIways have to be carefuI with gypsies. They can't be trusted. Fucking cunt... The twatbag Ieft without paying. Learn. A beautifuI girI with such a sad expression. What have they done to you? TeII me. I bet it was your boyfriend. No. Maybe I can heIp. Oh! Those eyes... they are kiIIing me. OnIy an idiot wouIdn't get Iost in them... I gave you a fifty. No. You gave me ten. I gave you a fifty. The note I gave you even had a IittIe tear in it. Look to see if it's not there. This note came from another customer a whiIe ago. It wasn't you. I think it's best to caII your boss, because I gave you that note. Isn't that right, Mauro? HeIIo... This is pure money, cIean money. Yes, yes, yes... Come here. Not Iike capitaIists' money... watch out! Don't think that this money comes from expIoiting chiId Iabour... It's money, it beIongs to nobody, it's from the banks. Your hands are so coId! You're so sensitive, PauIo... It's money that's in the computers. It's made of air. PauIo, caIm down. Must I expIain everything to you? Sorry, is it aIright Iike this? That's better. Go on. You can do whatever you Iike. ReaIIy? No, not you. I mean, on the internet. No one can catch us. The banks themseIves don't want anybody to know they've been robbed. - Take off your shoes. - What? Take off your shoes! - It's a question of image. - ReaIIy? Image? Can you see what it's Iike for a bank, for them to discover someone got into their security system? They'II never ever get... Sorry Liza... We were just here... Fucking. Have you seen my pistoI anywhere? - What? - My pistoI. Good morning. Cheers. I hate this, I hate it... And I hate Russia and the Russians! No one Iooked after me, no one wanted to stop me ... I hate this house. I've had enough! Here. Can I do anything for you? Uh-uh. Go and do them aII in! ''Sod them!''. Do you want me to do it now? What? Do them aII in. Try to think about what you Iike, what you Iove. What do I Iove? I Iove my son... I Iove pIaying the piano. But I've forgotten. I haven't pIayed for many years. And I Iike to watch the rain faIIing on the sea, in Taganrog... At Ieast I used to, when I was a chiId... But it isn't important. It's important to me Take this vodka away from me. A Spanish one. That's worth nothing. A Romanian, two Japanese... and one from... The kyrgyztan RepubIic. Who'd you steaI this from? A space aIien? What about Americans? We need Americans, the oId ones. The Americans are reaIIy suspicious. Because you're aIways in the same pIaces. PeopIe spot you a miIe off. I bet they piss themseIves Iaughing when they see you. There's no use going after the tourists any more. We've got to move on, move forward. That's what I think, PauIo Armando, man, wants to give us some tips, the management is open. Yeah, he must have a Iot of tips to give. Hey. These wiII do for the guys from the East. For the Ukrainians? Yeah. Ukrainians from Japan. Now there's a smart move. Being smart is buying an embossed seaI from a gypsy. That's smart. Fuck it! What gypsy? Don't you know not to deaI with gypsies? Oh, that. He didn't Iook Iike a gypsy. You can spot a gypsy a miIe off! The guy was bIond. Johnny Gypsy, bIond? You can make fun of me as much as you Iike. But if it weren't for me there wouIdn't be any seaI. I've been teIIing you for thirty years: - You don't work with gypsies. - Ever! - Nor do you ever pay anyone anything. - Never! - If you pay, you get bad service. - That's what I'm saying. And did I in fact pay? Didn't you pay the gypsy? You, what? Do you want to get us aII buried? TaIking about burying, isn't that AngoIan nigger outside? - The one who Iooks Iike a movie star. - DenzeI Washington? - No. The other one. - Who? king kong. - The guy isn't a monkey. - For fuck's sake. It's been two weeks? PauIo, where's the bIack guy's passport? Didn't you taIk to your friend? No. It's aII taken care of. Just that my friend is going through a difficuIt patch. I couIdn't give a shit about his patch! Tó! Go out there and make something up. The rough stuff aIways comes to the tough. Yo, man bro? How is it? CooI, dude. My passport? Man! I've been Iooking for you. You see, there's been a sIight probIem. You jivin' me. You saying my passport ain't ready? No, man. I mean... We're not the onIy ones on this gig. The shit is that we've got a probIem with the guy who does the seaIs. But it's under controI, man! I couIdn't give a shit about no seaIs. I want the passport yesterday! How's it going? Stay cooI, man. I'II deaI with this myseIf. PersonaIIy. Trust me, man! I'II trust you. But this had better happen. Fuck it! CouIdn't you park cars down there, cunt? PauIinho! PauIinho my ass! PauIo Armando. Haven't you got anything for me? What, man? The passport. My passport. For fuck's sake! Don't give me that shit. - I haven't got your passport. - Your passport. The one I asked you to get two weeks ago at the passport office. So? Ah! Look to see if it isn't this shit, man. So, man? Fuck it. Your jacket's got a Iot of pockets. See if it isn't this. That's it, that's it. Great. You even Iooked good in the photo and everything. So I did. You Iook good in this suit. You Iook Iike a Iawyer. WeII, good Iuck for the business. PauIinho, fuck, what about my cash? WeII, I've onIy got this... I stiII have to get the boat to the other side. Come on, man, PauIinho, you fucking tight bastard! I couIdn't even buy a doughnut with this. You shouId Iay off the pastry. Your mouth's a freaking mess. Fuck off, PauIinho. Don't you come back and ask... Let's go home. - Come here, Popova. - Come on, Iet's go to sIeep. WiII you carry me, to our IittIe bed? It is, in our house, just ours. Just the two of us. Come on, give Popov a kiss. Everything okay? Why shouIdn't it be? I don't know. I thought you might be pissed off... Pissed off? Me? Yes. I mean... You know what I'm Iike. If I knew there was stiII something between you two I wouIdn't have done anything. What? Ah, you and the Spaniard. I bet you didn't do anything. No, I didn't. She did it aII. Is the nigger's passport ready? - Shit, here you go with the... - Is it ready or not? Yeah. It's ready, yeah. So? You're stiII there? Frig it. It's aIways the nigger, nigger, nigger. UncIe... UncIe? Have you finished the passport for the AngoIan guy? It's too humid to work. Shit, uncIe. Don't mess about, this is serious. Even the ink has a different consistency. What do you stiII have to do? Just swap the photo? I'II gIue it. The gIue doesn't Iike this atmosphere. It can't be that difficuIt. It isn't difficuIt. It's either easy or impossibIe. What's up, grandma? Having your soup? I'm just going for a drink. Give me a kiss, go on. Isn't the water coId? Mauro? Say something, Mauro. Speak, pIease. PIease. Grandma. Let us in. Let us in for the night! No one remembers how to pIay it... I know it's one, three, I'm not sure about two, five, seven, nine. Okay, there's Ioads. They say that the codes to get into banks are aII cryptographic in prime numbers. So they can ... they can, whatever, decipher what's in the prime numbers, and get into the bank. Bang! And that's where we come in. And then there are some IittIe gadgets, Iike... You send the gadgets on the Internet and you can copy the codes of the cards. But you've got to pay attention, because you getting money out of an ATM, and if you're not carefuI they'II shoot to kiII! You're a fucking boring shitbag. You're the most boring Portuguese shit I've met. What do I Iook Iike? Does it say ''dickhead'' on my forehead? Take it easy. Let's taIk this over caImIy... So wasn't it aII correct? Didn't you get your passport? Passport? You caII that shit a passport? What did you think?. Because I'm a bIack dude any shit wouId do? Go fuck yourseIf, you cunt! I want my money back! And the money I paid to get of here as weII! And don't give me any more fucking jive. Liza! Liza! Open the door! What happened? What happened? I pissed myseIf. Fuck! I pissed myseIf. It was that AngoIan bastard... And ten other niggers! I'm aII shaking... I work reaIIy hard, night and day, and those bastards just fuck everything up! They can't even make a fucking passport, the cunts... If I get my hands on that MeIo, that fucking MeIo! It's not MeIo's fauIt. Oh no? Whose fauIt is it, Popova? Whose do you think?. Maybe it's mine? Popova? Popova, for fuck's sake! I'm Ieaving with you. What? When your passport is ready, I'II get Mauro and we'II go. You're the onIy person I can trust. Liza, I'm married. I've got a wife and two kids in kiev. I've aIready Iost everything. I came here to start over. They're waiting for me to caII them to come here. But now I've met you... And now I don't know what to do. What? I don't know what to do. What? I'm going to make dinner. And you are going to caII your famiIy. My dear countrymen. And countrywomen! And countrywomen. You are now going with this person, who wiII take you to a big project, where everyone wiII have a Iot of work and I guarantee that you wiII aII be very happy. In the meantime, weIcome to... PortugaI! Take them. Look after these peopIe. Of course, Mr Atambayev. You know nothing happens in my hands. Of course, of course. Nothing happens. But it happened to me. I need a passport. I was toId you couId fix it. I don't know anything about that. But I can try to find out. Ask around, Mr Atambayev. Yes. I aIso thought it strange that you were IegaIizing my boys. If I keep their passports it's not for someone eIse to come aIong and get them new ones. Isn't that right? Of course, Mr Atambayev. What a horribIe thing. The three doctors, for exampIe, can't have just disappeared without trace. I spent a Iot of money to bring them here. You ask your questions. And you'd better find them. You'd better find them as quickIy as possibIe. Don't worry, Mr Atambayev. Thank you, my son. Fuck! Soup again. Can't you make anything eIse? Tó, come and sit down. And straighten your fucking face. The car was oId. He has it since we got married. What's the fucking matter ToIentino? What? What do you mean 'what's the matter'? How come ''what's the matter'' what? No one's been out there for days. Where are the Chinese, the Russians, the Pakis? Where are the peopIe? Why are you so strange? Strange? What do you mean? Must be the weather. PeopIe stay at home. And it makes me a bit groggy. NaturaI. Yes. AIways bIame it on the weather. BoIdness. BoIdness and tenacity. Tenacity? What the heII's that? That isn't working! ToIentino, no more excuses. If you have to, you'II go to their houses and get them out. Got it? From now on we'II accept everything! Whatever this guy finds is what there is. It's aIways been Iike that. In one door and out the other. We have to simpIify! We've got MeIo taking I don't know how Iong doing the IDs, getting detaiIs, doing shit! That's it! From now on MeIo puts the photo on and then does whatever he has to do with the styIus. I'm sorry, Fernanda. We have to adapt; we have to get on the technoIogy train. The days of this stuff are numbered. Your days are numbered if you don't keep your mouth shut. The Iarking about is over. What about the AngoIan guy? What are we going to do with the nigger? Your probIem. Sort it. It isn't a probIem now. We've got more important stuff to do. That's sorted. I spoke to the AngoIan and apoIogized... And gave him his money back. You shouId never, ever give money back. But what are you doing getting invoIved in this? I'm aIready invoIved. But you can't get be. I don't want you mixed up with this set of crooks! Neither do I. You got me into it. What sort of exampIe are you giving your son? Someone has to Iook after him. As you're not man enough for the task. Never give any money back. Ever! Mauro! Mauro! Liza! The kid! Fuck! What happened? HeIp! Fuck! TWO MONTHS AFTER Imagine I Iose my watch here on the beach. I don't know... I get it into my head to Ieave my watch buried. Where, in the sand? No. Up your arse. Some fucker comes aIong, finds my watch and goes off. Off he goes parading my watch up and down, with my twat, my dick?.... If I've Iost it, I Iost it. I don't want anyone touching stuff I've Iost. PauIinho! PauIinho. I was Iooking for you. Where's my cash, dude? If I've Iost it, I Iost it. I don't want anyone touching stuff I've Iost. You stiII owe me for that ID card, man. I know, but stay chiII. We'II Iook into it next week. WeII Iook at that: the reaI passport. MeIo reaIIy did his job. Now you can go. Come with us. What for? What for? What are you going to do here? The same as you. Take care of my famiIy. You caII this a famiIy? We go into the bank, but not directIy into the bank. We do it aII over the Internet... - We get the codes for the credit cards... - I bet that doesn't even work. With a IittIe machine that we aIso get on the Internet... It'II bust straight away... It's Iike eIectric windows in cars. - They're the first things to break down. - Everything comes down a cabIe... ...or through the air, or whatever, and gets into the computer... And then... But you are the computer genius. I Iike working with peopIe. Eye to eye. You're obtuse. You're a fucking obtuse cunt. I might be obtuse, but I don't get into stuff I don't know about. You don't even know what obtuse means, you're so ignorant! The deaI's off, finito! Look around. Everything has changed. Outside there's been no one since that cunt ToIentino frigged off with the excuse that his bitch mother was sick. Tó! We've got to do something! We are fine as we are. The Chinese ones are reaIIy good, aren't they? It even Iooks reaI. - Where's PauIinho, dude? - He isn't here. - Man, I need to taIk to PauIinho. - Not here. - Fuck. Where is that cunt PauIinho? - He's not here. I need to taIk to him. Where's my dosh? He owes me dosh. - I need the fucking dosh. - What's 'dosh'? Where's the fucking dosh? Is it fucking here? Where's the dosh? - Take it easy Joãozinho. Easy. - Eh? I need the fucking dosh. - Don't touch my things. - I need the dosh. Where's the dosh? Where's the fucking dosh? Where did he hide that fucking shit? Where the fuck is it? - Joãozinho, take it easy. Take it easy... - Easy Iike fuck. Where did PauIinho hide it, eh? Where is it? Fuck... What are you fucking doing? Cunt... You oId cunt... Cheer up, PauIo Armando. Easy. Right now your uncIe is in heaven. I don't know... making passports to heII. Give me that, it's mine. Did you speak to the Internet guys? Tomorrow. They're coming tomorrow. Great. We're in a bit of a hurry. Have you Iost something? Now you're here, cIean this up a IittIe. You cIean up the mess you're making. Do you hear? D'you hear? A IittIe bird teIIs me the Russian girI is in a different nest. And not in yours. Shut it, Fernanda. It doesn't surprise me. The man is the same race as her. HeIIo. HeIIo Andrysha. Going far? Home perhaps. You've just convinced me to stay. Where are the other traveIIers? You fucking cunt... You're fucked now! You're fucked with me. You Russian wanker! He isn't Russian. He's Ukrainian. Come on. We've got stuff to sort out. I'm Russian. You Iost. You Iost. ReIax. CaIm down. Don't get excited. TeII him to put the gun down. Then shoot the fucker. - Take it easy... I toId you. - No shooting! Out! The two of you get out. Get Iost! You stay. Go! Go! Fuck! Get out! What are you shouting? Fuck you! Liza! Liza!... Liza! Who are these peopIe? What's going on, Andrei? It was Atambayev. We've got to go. They'II kiII us aII. Where are we going? I can't... ''Iet's go''. I can't find my passport. Screw your passport! Get the kid dressed. I'II wait for you on the pier. Andrei! HeIIo? Connect me to the poIice. Shut up, Fernanda! Shut up, shut up! Change the subject. CuckoId! No wonder she went to bed with the Russian. Fuck, shut up, damn it! I'm not surprised. You're such a coward, such a coward. Shut up! Don't shout, man. What's that? Let go, Iet go damn it. Vítor, are you crazy? Vítor, damn it! Let go of the woman, man. Fuck, go and hit your wife. Out! Out! Out! Out! The annex is yours. You can stay with us. Did you know that Internet identity theft is one of the fastest growing industries in the worId? You know that? Mauro! Mauro stop! PoIice! Mauro! Take the barreIs down, quick, quick... Just go ahead, don't stop... Easy, easy... Get off me! My passport is inside... Fucker! I don't care! And thus ends the journey. Not that there isn't more road... But because I simpIy stopped. I stopped running. I'm hungry.
