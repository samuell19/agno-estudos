(woman laughing) - [Woman] Charlie, Charlie. - [Man] Life is hard, motherfucker. - [Doctor] A danger to yourself or to others. - Charlie, Charlie. - Innocent, innocent. - Not guilty. - Charlie. - [Man] By reason of insanity. - Charlie! - Charlie. Kill for me, Charlie. Charlie, Charlie. (dramatic music) - It's madness. The truth is I'm running from it, from her, from everything. I can feel her watching me. Around every corner, in every window, she waits. (woman laughing) Stop! (horn honking) (eerie music) - Thank you. Thanks for saving me. - [Doctor] You seem a little agitated today. Did you leave the halfway house too soon? - I'm fine. - Do we need to do a blood test? - What for? - Come clean with me, Charlie. I'm here to help you, always remember that. If you have a problem, it's okay to get help. If you're slipping-- - I'm not. - Remember, a danger to yourself or to others. - You know me, Dr. Resner, I like everyone. - Good. You must always fight your urges. - I met a little girl that looked like my sister before. - [Doctor] Before she died. - As opposed to what? - [Doctor] You're not still having the dreams about her, are you? - Not for a few months, a year. - That's what I like to hear. How's the new place? - I met the girl that used to live there, she talks to me. - That's good, it's nice to have friends. Is she pretty? - She was beautiful. - I'll see you next week, Mr. Cavenaugh. (tools buzzing) - Hey, Charlie! Hey, Charlie! Fuckin' freak. You heard me the whole time, didn't you? You're a weird kid, Cavenaugh. - Thank you, Mr. Lincock. - You trying to be a funny guy? I want you to show the new guy around, train him a little. Make sure he knows he can't get away with shit around here. - I don't train. - You train or I report you. - You shouldn't do that. - You finish the papers, Buckler? - Even know how to spell too. - Another wise ass. It's all they ever send me. Okay, this here's Charlie Cavenaugh, the best machinist I got. He'll be showing you around. - Dave Buckler. Most people call me Buck, like a dollar. - Charlie. - Get to work. - Hey, don't worry about it, you don't have to teach me. I just spent 18 months practicing. There you go, take it. You know, you remind me of this guy I used to know. Good friend. Hey, Char, what do you do for kicks around this joint? - Not much. - Yeah, I gotta quit smokin' this shit. In the joint, you can't help it, right? So what put you here in this hellhole? Hey, no problem, Chief. Just trying to make a little conversation. You know, pass the monotony away, you know how it is. What do you say you and I go see a movie or play some pool or somethin' like that? Got to kinda feel my way around this joint. - I can't today. See you tomororw. - Yeah, maybe tomorrow, huh? Walk easy. Fuckin' place is gonna drive me nuts. (ominous music) - You the neighbor, right? You need to score? Hey, Quote, is that motherfucker staring at us? - Hey, you need somethin'? Oh what, you don't hear me? Go get him, Jerry. (somber music) - [Charlie] It was the darkness in me. And everything else was gone until I met her, the girl that used to live here before me, the one who left in a bathtub full of her own blood. She owns my dreams like she owns this place. Chillingly, breathtakingly, beautiful. She knows who I am. - [Woman] Come to me, Charlie. - Dear Pasqua killed herself because she didn't have the time. - Do I look dead to you? - You look like a vampire sent to punish me. - I'll give you everlasting life. - Life, life is for the living. - Like your family, Charlie? Killer, I'll get you. - Where you going so fast, boy? - Late. - Late, man. If you late, why you gonna bother, huh? What do you say you look at something? - Take it easy, man. - No harm, just a look. Okay, you'll see. Hey, Janetta, get on out here. You're gonna love this pussy, boy. This girl's fresh, hot off the press, ain't broken in. - I have to go. - Man, it ain't like I seen any ladies going to your room. - She's a baby. - That's the best kind. Chance of a lifetime. You can break her in, boy. He's probably a fag anyway. Why don't you go in and make us some pancakes? (tools buzzing) - Hey, where you been, brother man? That Lincock guy is pissed. - I had a bad dream. - Huh? - I had a bad dream. - What? - I had a bad dream! - Yeah, I dabble in dreams sometimes myself. - You're a funny guy, Buck. - Well, it gets me by, you know what I mean? Sometimes you just step in it and keep right on going. Speaking of shit. - Nice of you to show up, Cavenaugh. - His mom was sick. - Nice try, Buckler. His mom is dead. Is there something you weren't shown yesterday? - Yeah, but charlie showed me just now. - Great, I got a shop full of losers, and now you're showing up late too. - It won't happen again. - We need to start our own business, my man. You know more about machining than that guy ever will. You know, you remind me of this good friend of mine. One of them quiet, smart type of guys you can't quite figure out. This guy Lou Labonte. He was kind of like my mentor in the pen, you know? He had dreams. Kinda took me under his wing, you know, got me straight. Taught me to see some things. He died of cancer not too long ago. Say, Char, use a carton of sticks, man? - No, thank you. - You got a girl, Char? Well, maybe I can fix you up sometime. Why don't you go get a bite of something with me? If I don't eat now, I'm gonna smoke. - Megan says she can get me this job working over at Calhoun's. It's a lot less fucked up than things here. Anyway, the pay is pretty good. - I'm ready to order now if you don't mind. - How you doing today? - I'll take a ham and cheese on rye, provolone cheese, with lettuce that isn't wilted like last time. And hold the mustard. Are you gonna take my order? Give me your manager. - Dude, I asked you how you're doing, and all you can say is I'll have a ham and cheese with provolone? I was just trying to be nice. - I don't give a damn what you think. (punch cracking) (dramatic music) - I'm sorry, that was bad. - He started it, right? - I'll have a turkey sub. - So where you want to eat, brother man? - I gotta go. - Man, he's saying 15. - I need 20 on that. - 20. - Well well, what kind of carrot juice you drinking? - I'm no rabbit. - (laughs) Fuckin' crackhead. - I need something to help me sleep. - [Jerry] We got it all if you got the money. - [Charlie] How much? - You know, I knew you were gonna come visit me real soon. - I need to sleep. - 20 bucks. - Sweet dreams, killer. (laughs) - I didn't mean to scare yoo. I can save you from all that, Charlie. - This time I came to save you. - Why would I want to go back there? - Why wouldn't you? - I can't. - You're not real. - Last time your father beat you, you laughed, didn't you? You laughed because you knew what was going to happen, didn't you, Charlie? Kiss me. (Pasqua laughing) - [Doctor] An accident? - Work. - Any dreams? - Everyone has dreams. - Do you ever dream about your mom? Why do you think that is? - Because she could've saved us. She didn't have to stay with that monster. - [Doctor] Are you still angry at her? - No, she was just trying to keep it together. - [Doctor] It's okay to talk about this, Charlie. It's okay to feel guilty, too, but it wasn't your fault. Your father killing your mother and sister, that wasn't your fault. You had to kill your father or else he-- - Look, Doc, I should get to work. You think you can give me a little somethin' to help me sleep? - I don't think that would be such a good idea given your past addictions, do you? - You're probably right. - I want you to come back tomorrow, Charlie. I want to talk to you when you're not so tired. I think it's time to open some closed doors. Look back so maybe we can start to look forward. - If you think so. Tomorrow then. - I'll see you tomorrow, Charlie. (tools buzzing) - [Charlie] They think they know me. They think they understand me. The thing is, I'm sane. Pasqua sees that. After years of solitude, someone's finally come for me. - So you ain't mad at me, are you, Char? - No reason to be. - Just the way you did about five guys' worth of work in there, you know? Figured something was on your mind. - I had a long night. - Bowed her up good, did ya? - Listen, Buck, do you know anyone that could score for me? - It's bad karma. - Okay. - Hey, Char, if I had a little get together, would you come? Got this girl I want you to meet. - Thank you, I probably shouldn't. - Oh, come on, come on, come on, come on, man. It'll be fun, huh, huh? - Fun's good. - Good, I'm gonna set it up, all right? - Okay, see you tomorrow. - Take care, Chief. (eerie dreamlike music) (kids chattering) - [Jerry] Hey man, you need to get up. - We got the ride ticket for you, boy. - Not now. - Man, you should fuck him up for that shit, man. Crazy fuckin' freak. - That's a valued customer right there. (phone ringing) (eerie music) - Charlie, innocent Charlie. Who killed those men? - [Charlie] One, two, five, seven, eight, nine, 10. - (laughs) Hi, Chucky. - You're caught, punish him. - Say good night. - Save me, Charlie. - Say goodbye, Charlie. (eerie music) (knocking) - Good day, sir. My name is Hank, and I'm your neighborhood carrier for the Tribune. I know you've heard of the Tribune because it's the top carrier of local news in this area. Yes, sir. - [Charlie] No, thank you. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, please, please hear me out because I got some special offers for you today. That's right, eight-week and 12-week offers. And I know once you hear 'em, you'll know you must, must take the Tribune. - No, thank you. - Well, that's all right if you don't need any right now. I mean, we bill at the end of the month, and it's only pennies a day. And I got a special offer for you, too, I know. Right here, if you sign right here, you get a special gift. A real gift. - Look, I don't have any money. - Well, that's all right, you don't need it right now. We'll bill you at the end of the month. Only a few pennies a day, sir, and you get a free gift. All you've got to do is sign right here on the dotted line. - Back out. - Please, please, look, I know you need the Tribune. You got to have the Tribune. Look, look, look I don't want to go back, so-- - Get out! - Well, maybe next time. Maybe in a couple days or maybe next week or some other time when it's better for you. (eerie music) - Hey there, Charlie. (Buck knocking) I'll take good care of you, my sweet. - [Buck] You in there, Char? - Don't let him take you away from me, Charlie. He's not your friend. (Buck knocking) (Buck knocking) - I knew you were here. - Hey, Buck. - Mr. Lincock was pretty pissed off at you today. I told him you were sick, all right? You got a great place here, Char. - I had the flu. - So just came by to tell you that party is gonna be on Saturday night if you're feeling better by then. Got some real winners living downstairs, don't you? - I might be busy, sorry. - What's going on, Char? Got this whole thing arranged, man. You're supposed to meet these chicks. - The flu. - The flu? Planning on having the flu this weekend? - Okay, I'll be there. I just need to get a little sleep right now. - Don't have to ask this dog twice. Just wanted to make sure you were alive. Sweet dreams. (ominous music) - [Pasqua] I'm glad you came back. I thought your friends had you cornered. - [Charlie] How do you know what happens when I'm awake? - Because I'm always with you. - How come we never fly in these dreams? With my sister, sometimes we'd fly. - Because I'm real. She's dead. Don't be mad at me. Lay with me. Make love to me. Cross over with me, Charlie. Be with me. (laughs) You're a very bad boy, Charlie. Very bad boy. (slaps cracking) - No! (pills rattling) - Friend or foe? - Just lookin' for you. - You were so unfriendly last time. Now you wanna talk? - Purchase. - Purchase. I guess we're friends again now, aren't we? You lookin' to float? - Nah, I need to get up. - That's easy enough. It's just a question of how high. (eerie music) (Pasqua laughing) - [Pasqua] Charlie. Come to me, Charlie. Innocent, guilty. Charlie. - By reason of insanity. - Charlie! - [Pasqua] Kill for me, Charlie. Charlie. - Where the hell have you been? What the fuck are you doing, huh? Your fuckin' quack has been calling, looking for you. What'd you do, finally go on a killing spree? - What time is it? - You're late, Cavenaugh, that's what time it is. - I couldn't help being sick. - I ain't stupid, and you ain't sick. You better think long and hard whether you still want this job because I'm gonna give you one more chance. That's it, no more. Goddamn it! - Doing all right, Charlie boy? - Yeah, I just want to apologize for yesterday. I wasn't feeling in the right mind. - Hey, no problem. We boys, right? - Right, things will be better now. - You need to get laid, my man. - I did yesterday. - I swear you get more than me. Here I am trying to fix you up. You got any friends for me? - Any friend she has would be dead. - Look, I ain't too picky, I'll meet her. You wait and see this girl I fix you up with, man. She's cool, she won't fuck with your mind. - Good. I got to go now. I got an appointment. - Hey, I peed in my PO's cup yesterday. Later, Char. - I'll transfer your call to his office now. - Let me demonstrate, I grabbed the loon like this, right? Got him a nice little. You mind your own business, okay loser? Okay, this guy didn't say okay, all right? Instead he went fuckin' ballistic on me, so I grabbed the mace and maced his ass right in the fuckin' eyes. - Uh huh. - So he's lying on the floor, hootin' and hollerin' my eyes, my eyes. I nonchalantly walk over there, and wham right in the fuckin' balls. Got to watch them, man. I think these people ought to all be put to sleep. Because these people today are dangerous. Got to watch your back, man. You got to kick 'em in the balls, kick 'em in the balls. They'll bite your nose off. (eerie music) - Good work, my Charlie. I think it's so funny. Oh, it feels so good. - Charlie? Charlie? Charlie, this isn't your home. The doctor is waiting for you. - Just one moment. Bad flu, huh? I guess it'll pass. How are you doing otherwise? - Fine as ever. - I'm afraid for your own good, I'll have to order a urine test immediately. - What have I done? - No one said you did anything, Charlie. I'm only here for your own good, okay. I just want to make sure you're not slipping on all the gains that you've made. - I'm not going back in a facility. - No one said anything about a facility. - So you already have one in mind. - I didn't mean to upset you, Charlie. I'm just concerned about you. You look like you may not be doing so well. - I told you I had the flu. What more do you want, Doc, hm? I have a great job and a girlfriend now. How much more normal you want to get? - You never told me you had a girlfriend. - I've done nothing but tell you about her. - [Doctor] When? (Charlie laughs) Is this girl, has this girl you're seeing ever been in care too? - Why, is that the only kind of woman you could ever see me with? - I'm warning you, Charlie, just calm down. I'm only trying to help you, okay? - Sorry, Dr. Resner, this flu has just worn me out. - I believe you. - You're kinda the rock that's kept me in place. - Well, of course I do the best I can, as I'm sure you do. - If you don't mind, I better get home and get some sleep. How soon can we schedule that next appointment? - [Doctor] Angela, how soon can we schedule an appointment for Charlie Cavenaugh? - Good day, gentlemen. You ever get the feeling life is meaningless when you don't have friends? - Who else you buying shit from, cracker? - I ain't buyin' it, that's just it. It's all bullshit, know what I mean? - Yeah, I know what you mean. So what do you need, a little blow, blowjob? - Pretty funny, blow. Nah, actually I just want to finally introduce myself. Yeah-- - Don't. - You're always too cohesively busy to talk. My name's Charlie Cavenaugh, and you? - I'm Quote. My associate Jerry here. - You know, this motherfucker's really asking for it, man. - I'm just being social to you. My doctor says it's a good idea. - The good customers, they catch a break for a short time. This doctor friend of yours, he got anything to sell wholesale? - I don't know, I'll ask him. For now, I better get my sleep. - Yeah, do that, you fuckin' loon. - Trust me, you shouldn't talk like that. What if Pasqua heard? - What you say? Wait, wait, what you say? What'd he say? Damn. (eerie music) - Why do you kill? Why do you kill? - The same reason as you, Charlie. - I don't want anyone hurt. - I only love you. You did it, not me. - I didn't kill anybody. - You killed your father, didn't you? - With reason! At least I didn't kill myself. (smack cracking) - When are you gonna tell the whole truth, Charlie? When are you gonna see I'm the only way? The truth and a light. I'll never leave you. (glass shattering) - Hey, what's up, man? (dog barking) What? Man, fuck you! Hey, your bitch still got that big ass? - Hey, could you keep it down out there, please? - [Jerry] What? Yeah, okay, I'll keep it down for you, man. Yeah, I'll keep it down for you. (glass shattering) Why don't you come out here and make me? You fucking crackhead, why don't you come out and let me kick the shit out of you, huh? Come on. Stupid ass bitch. I'll fuck you up. What's up? Hey. (whistles) Hey, baby doll, come here. Come here. (eerie music) (kids chattering) - Are you my sister or Pasqua in disguise? - You know who I am. - I'm so sorry. You've never left my mind. - But I have left your dreams. You have to save yourself, Charlie. Get help. (Charlie crying) - I'm your brother. Oh shit. Not too smart. Yeah, I know he's out of town already. I was just wondering if I could come in and see someone else possibly. (ominous music) I have cash. You don't seem to understand, I need help. But I know my appointment isn't until next week. Hello, hello? I have cash! - Son of a bitch! Now get back to work. Goddamn. Uh uh, stop right there. This job starts at 7:00 a.m. Apparently you don't believe me when I say don't come back if you can't be on time. - [Charlie] I had to pick up a prescription. It won't happen again. - You're damn right it won't happen. Just walk right out of here, Charlie. - [Buck] Ease up, boss. - If you want to keep working here, Buckler, get back to your press. Me and the mental patient are talkin'. - Hey, don't say that. - Well, what'd you think, Buckler, that he was a parolee like you? Now get back to your press. I can't fire you fuckin' lunatics or I would. - Maybe I didn't hear you. - [Lincock] I said I can't fire you lunatics. The goddamn state won't let me. (Lincock choking) Please get off me. Get off! - Charlie! Damn it, Charlie, listen! Don't kill him! Charlie! - Don't try to make that good. - Mr. Lincock's all right, Charlie. - Thanks for being my friend. - Wait. Look, Mr. Lincock ain't gonna want some government guys coming around here trying to figure this out, all right? I can work it out, man. - I would've killed him. - I can fuckin' work it out. - I would've killed him. - So I put the shit right in his fuckin' mouth and I asked him if it really meant that much to him. Fuckin' bitch. You wanna talk shit now, freak? I'm gonna fuck your shit up, you goddamn mental case. - So how you gonna get home? The stairs? What you got to barter with? - [Charlie] Trade. - We ain't no fuckin' Indians, man. - Hey. What you got there, Charlie? - That's my name. - Just say it, Quote, and it's done, kicked. - Trade. - Oh, this is minor league, baby. Kiddie candy. This doctor must not like you very much, huh? Ain't got no trade. - Can you spot me till tomorrow? - Just like everyone else, he wants it for free now. Like we owe him something and shit. - I can pay tomorrow, I just need a little somethin'. - You get the fuck out of here. You come back when you get your check. - My pills. - Yours or ours? - Mine. - You be careful what you ask for. I just might give it to you. - [Jerry] Fuck! (Quote laughs) Damn! - Boy, you gotta give that crazy guy credit. - Give him credit? I'm gonna fuckin' kill his ass, man. Fuck! (Charlie shouting) - There can be do doubt that what is usual is unusual. What's normal is insane. What's a dream is reality. - I'll never leave you. I'll never laugh at you. You'll never be lonely again. My sweet killer. (Jerry knocking) - You got lucky today, you freak. You can hide all you want, but you're still a junkie. You listening in there, boy? You know I'm gonna fuck you up, huh? - [Woman] Shut the fuck up! - I'm gonna get you soon, you know that right? - [Man] Knock that shit off! We're trying to sleep over here! - Why don't you come out here and make me? That's what I thought, punk. Nice lipstick, fag. (punch cracking) - You want my consideration? Consideration, do you want my consideration? - Yeah. (Jerry coughing) - The doctor is gone for the rest of the week. - That's funny, he called me. He said to come down and pick up my Valium prescription. - That is funny since Dr. Resner doesn't give Valium prescriptions, Charlie. - (laughs) Gee, I didn't think you knew my name. - I know who you are, now leave. - Now I would very much appreciate it if you would give me some pills to help me sleep until Dr. Resner gets home from Hawaii. - The Cayman Islands. - Cayman Islands then! Please give me my pills. Samples will be fine. - Leave now if you don't want any trouble. - Open the window, Angela! I need to make a phone call. Can I speak with Dave Buckler please? No, I can't leave a message. You see, it's a family tragedy. Yes, a murder. Please, can I talk to him? Hey, Buck, meet me after work, okay? I need to talk to you. Yeah. I don't suppose I can help you. - Yeah, go peacefully and you won't have to get maced. - No problem, I was just trying to pick up my prescription. - You seem to have scared some people, Charlie. And it's not good to scare people. - Her name is Angela! Question to answer. You don't believe in God, do you? You lie in bed at night wondering what's the void? And they say I'm crazy. (blows thudding) - You gonna fuckin' kick him or what? Good. And you're damn lucky I don't have you arrested. Because I could rightfully have you locked up till Dr. Resner gets back, but I won't. Now Mr. Cavenaugh, I want you to exit the building and don't come back until your next appointment. You understand me? You're very lucky. These fuckin' loons, man. What'd I tell you? - You're right, that is fun. - You look like shit. Hey, good news, you can come back to work. Why not? Did a lot of manipulating to get it back. - I have other things to worry about now. - One thing I learned quick. Principal can you get in a hell of a lot of trouble, Char. - True, I need a favor. - [Buck] Shoot. - I need something to help me sleep. I need to sleep. I'm having bad dreams. - If something can beat you down, you stay away. You walk way, you run away. Stay awake. - You. - Me, you promised me you'd come to my party tonight. Yeah, that's what friends do, they keep promises. - I have a girl. - Then you need some comparison shopping, my boy. (mellow rock music) - How many people are coming, Buck? - Including us? Let me think. There's one and two and four. Four people are coming. - What about your roommate? - I wouldn't really call her a roommate. She's just this little old lady that I rent a room from, you know? She's visiting her grandkids for the weekend. - Oh. - Two girls, Char, two. - I do kinda have a girlfriend though. - Don't worry about it, man. These are good people, you know? And like I said, comparison, hm? - Shopping. - Right, except this shit's already bought. I already pitched you, man. It's in the bank, know what I mean? - What time do they get here? - What if I told you they were already here? - (laughs) I'd say I already have a girl like that. - Man, Char, you gotta quit trying to fight the whole world. I still think you need to get laid. - [Charlene] Is that so? - I know two girls perfect for the part. - You got any beer for us, Buck baby? - I don't know, Charlie, we got any beer for these girls? - Yeah. - Hell yeah. Char, this is my girl Charlene and her friend Nora. - Hi. - Hi. - Here you go. - [Nora] I like you, Charlie, don't be so nervous. Buck was worried about you. - Buck's a great guy. (Charlie shouts) It's not safe. - [Nora] I'll take my chances. - I can't. (Charlie shouts) - Hey, where you going? - [Charlie] Stay away. - Damn, Charlie! - Get out of here. Jerry thought you weren't coming back. I knew you'd be back because you need so bad, now don't you? - You know what I need. Help me sleep. - Forever. - For as long as I can. I have things to work out. - It's gonna cost you extra this time considering damages and all. Because I'm a businessman, Charlie. And well Jerry is gonna be gunning for you. I'm the only one who's gonna keep you breathing now, aren't I? - It's all I got left. - Well aren't you gonna owe me? Yeah, I got something special for you, boy. This pill, it's gonna end all your worries, all your cares. It's the super duper knock you off your ass space ride. - That's what I need. - Sleep away, sleep away. (Quote laughing) (eerie music) - 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35. 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51. 398, 399, fuck! Tricked! Pasqua! Pasqua! Better, better, better. Better, better, better. Better, better, better. Better, better. (dial tone droning) Pasqua, help me! (Charlie shouting) Please don't leave me. Please. Please don't leave me. I'll be with you forever, I promise, I promise. - After that shit's done with him, he's gonna be lucky to sleep for days. - Hey, neighbor, get a good night sleep? - Like a baby, why? - You can't sleep, freak. - Lunatics can always sleep. - You're gonna get put to sleep real soon. - Let's just put a cap in his ass and solve this shit, man. - Till death do us part. (eerie music) - Come on up for a look, young man. We won't bite. - That's a good one. All our stuff is good. - Can I have it? - Yeah, sure. I paid good money for that, but I can make you a good deal. - I'm getting married, but we have no money. I need this one. - No, nothing's for free, kid. Make me an offer. - Cheap, honey. - Thank you, I'll be back. - We've been bringing that thing out to our garage sale for years. - Young man. Young man. (phone ringing) - [Charlie] Fun factory, how may I help you? Hey, Doc, back so soon? Gee, I don't know if I can come in this weekend. I'm kinda busy contemplating marriage. (eerie music) - [Doctor] I'm very proud of you, Charlie, for coming down here today. I wasn't sure whether you would or not. - You could say we're almost friends. - Well, of course we're almost friends. But I'm also your doctor, and I think you need to go into the hospital for a little while. - I'm not going back there. I'm preparing for my wedding. Just need a little something to help me sleep. I don't think that's asking a lot. - I do think you need to go into a brief program. I'm not doing this to punish you. - You're not doing it. Just give me the pills and everything will be fine. - Sit down, Charlie, you're only making this-- - Don't go too far. You were fooled, Doc, all of you were fooled. - What are you talking about? - I killed 'em all. My father killed no one. When my rage hit, the darkness came, crept all around, and I killed who I meant to protect. And then I kept it a secret, and you all believed it. And they say I'm stupid. - You were only a child. Let me help you, Charlie. (punch thudding) (ominous music) (dramatic music) - Oh shit. (gun clicks) (pan clanging) - Funny, fun, fun, funny. Kill the freak, huh? Not bad work, do you think? - That was beautiful, darling. - Fun fun funny farm, how may I help you? Don't come here, Buck. - Perfect temperature, Charlie. - You always gonna keep me waiting like this, doll face? (Horton knocking) - [Horton] Charlie Cavenaugh, open up the door. - The guests, they're here. (Horton knocking) - [Horton] We don't want to hurt you, Charlie. Let us in, we just want to talk. - I would've been your friend. Welcome to the dream. (gunshot banging) Will you marry me? - Yes. - Charlie! Charlie, Charlie. - You'll be my best man. (laughs) Late as usual. - Charlie! Come on, Charlie! (eerie music) - [Charlie] Someone should've seen it coming. One of the happily ever after people. God smiles at me and forgives. I wanted so much and got so little. Meant so good and did so bad.
