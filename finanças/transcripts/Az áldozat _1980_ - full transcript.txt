After watching the corpse, I report that she was murdered between 1 and 2 am. That's what the rigor mortis and the body temperature show. - Good morning. - Hello. - Can I see her? - Yes, of course. - Good morning, Comrade Colonel. - Good morning. Excuse me, I don't want to bother you, but I just heard about this case and... - Your information excellent early in the morning. Otherwise, feel free to take a look at her. Hmm, victims and your bizarre theories. By the way, where's the problem? What do you mean, Comrade Colonel? To catch the murderer, that's the problem. But you always talk about the victim. Oh, come on, Crystal, stop it. She died because the killer's a step ahead of us. So the killer should have invited us, right? Well, see you again. - Good bye, Comrade Colonel. The murder cases of the last five years, 26 victims. - I thought there were 40 cases. - That's all I could bring now, but soon I will have all of them. - Listen, Gustav... - What's that? ...So do you know this book? "IS THE VICTIM GUILTY?" Your photos are in it. . Eh, I'm screwed with this, though, the old man said, I have to finish this one first, and the second volume will be the big business. - In which he can prove how... - Yeah, but I never seen him again. I must meet him, you understand?! Uh-oh. Good bye. - Sorry, but I didn't hear you come in. - Just sit back. Look, Crystal, you're one of my best men, so that's why I don't want to lose you. Well, I have a suggestion for you. Take a vacation for one month right now. You can dream about your obsessions at home, but not here. But I have two months, Comrade Colonel. I said one month, but there are other aspects as well. So, during this month you can watch the Mickey Mouse movies, you can prove your obsessions, or you can forget this whole thing. And then after that, you will work for me the same way like anybody else. Is that clear? Yes, understood. What's wrong? Good evening. - What do you want? - I am Zoltan Crystal, criminal investigator. Excuse me, but I finally managed to get your book, and I really like it. Then go back to where you came from. I need your help. No more help. Are you gonna leave, or do I need to throw you out? Just listen to me, please. I promise, it won't be long. I just want to find the next victim, same as you wanted. I continued from where you left off, but unfortunately I hit a wall. I'm insecure, my intuitions are overrated, and without evidences this is all just an abstraction. But I'm sure you already have the key to the proof. - The scientific? - Yes. - That's all you want? - Yes! Why didn't you bring some removal men with you to empty my flat, when you've also already emptied my brain completely, huh? Now get out! Go away! Get out of here! Flute chewing gum? Maybe two cartons. Hello. 'Tibi' chocolate? No. We've got enough. Candies? 'Nyugi', 'Fur?', 'Demeter'? 'Fur?' is okay. 10 cartons. Well, then, 'Univer' garlic paste? One carton will be enough. - 'Univer' mustard? - One carton. I'd like to pay. - 'Bugac v?re'? - No, we still have all the pepper paste. Thanks. What can I get you? 14+17.60+30+... ...91. Sardine? 91. - We don't need sardine. - Chinese bean? Two cartons. - Excuse me. - Packet soup? 10 meatball and 5 mushroom cream soups. - Spring vegetables? - No need. 'M?rka' sour cherry? Can I wait for you after closing? Can't you see that we're working? - Sour cherry syrup? - There is enough syrup. Please, believe me, it would be very important. There's something in you. Anna, you could talk about this another time, I have to go soon. But you don't see how violent he is? If you don't get out right now, I'm calling the police. - What did you say? - Macaroni? Goddammit! I've come for the photographs. Do you have them? - Good evening! - Good evening. What do you mean? Because I didn't get any photos. That was your colleauge who sat here where you are now at noon today. And what did my colleauge say? Some photos accidentally fell under the escalator. Your colleauge told me to come back after closing time. Okay, wait a minute. I'm closing up there. You see anything? They're definitely further inside. Oh my god! - Are you still looking for something? - No. No, I just... - Are you really an investigator? - Yes, I am. With so dreamy eyes? Someone's waiting for me outside. - Well, then, thank you for your help. - Don't mention it. Well, then, good night. Good night, investigator. I don't know how I could think that no one is waiting for you. Hey, doc. Come here, John. Look, what a gruesome cut. She bled out almost instantly. The saleswoman. - Hello, Crystal. - I'm here, Comrade Colonel. Did you know her? Anna Bujdoso from the food store. This will surely interest you. I just don't understand how the hell they could come here with this car. Look at this! Take a good look! If I kick you out at the door, then you come back through the window? - Just take a look! - I don't care. This woman was killed yesterday afternoon. Then call the police. But I knew in advance what was gonna happen to her. Five days before the murder. And if I'd have been sure about that, and if you'd just helped me, then... Try to understand, there's no more time. Say something! Don't you want to do something? Don't try to turn this around on me. You think I'm a fool, don't you? Because the others were looking at you like you are an idiot. I believe in something that you once believed in, that victims can be recognized, anywhere and anytime. And I want to prove it, even in such a short time. Nonsense. There are dangerous places and certain types of groups; there are certain people, but there are no stigmata. You are always avoiding this topic in your book, it is almost behind every sentence of yours. No matter what we call it, but it must be something. And you know it. We just need to prove it. And we need someone to this. Someone who is still alive. I will find her for you. I know how to find her. And then you want to send me away? Are you sure you don't want to finish? Yes, I do. Yes, I want to. You're just gonna leave me here? I have some sparkling wine at home. Nothing's good enough for you, huh? You poor bastard. Hello, mister investigator, what a coincidence. - Good evening. - Women are crazy for you. - I don't think so. - Look, I know what I saw. - You heading home? - That's right. - Do you want me to walk you home? - Well, why not? - But isn't your wife waiting for you? - You know, I'm not married. - And do you have other good quality? - Well, not much. And I can already feel the lack one of them. - Hmm? - I can't dance. - And what's wrong with that? - Because now I would invite you to dance. - Don't admit it and then maybe they'll let you in. Quick, now. You don't want a tie, sir? For the nice and pleasant guests only. Thank you, but now... I'd choose this one. It'd look great one you. Very elegant. That's brand-new, from England. - Well, I don't know. - But I'd like to. I'll buy it for you to remember this night. Take a look at yourself. Let me help you. *Dark wings fly through the night* *And yellow light on the bridge* *Rustling and moonbeam* *A man awaits you down there* *Oh, I wish the dawn would come!* *Oh, I wish the dawn would come!* *A knocking on the garden path* *A hundred shadows are on their way* *A sallow strange whisper* *And Ad?l R?cz is so scared....* You see how easy it is? . Hold me closer. Don't be afraid of me. Now you lead me. Can you feel my body pressed against yours? Oh, I wish the dawn would come. The tape is over. Now flip the cassette. Can you hear me? You are here? Why aren't you answering me? You want to take a bath? - How long have you been living here? - For five years. - Where do your parents live? - In the countryside, but why? - And why are you here? - I don't understand you. - Answer me! What's wrong with you? - I don't know anything about you. - And I don't know you, either. Who was that man who had been waiting for you last time? It doesn't matter. You know, I've never had anyone who would have been interesting. There was someone in my life when I was 16. He was a very attractive man and I got so much lessons from him that I can never forget them. Does it bother you if I talk about this? Because it's good to talk about it. But if it bothers you so much, why do you interrogate me? I swear, you are jealous. Will I see you again? Is there anything new in saleswoman's case? There's not much, but we found a fingerprint. That can bring us closer to the solution. I don't think so, because that was the Colonel's fingerprint. He was touching everything, but the killer was wearing gloves. I would need a camera for a few days. Single-lens reflex? Praktica L Pentacon. This should be good. I sensed something about the saleswoman. But all the same, I felt a little uncertainty. Something came up. - Something always comes up. But only until I have a fixed motive. Only one motive. The challenge, the provocation, right? What do you mean? There is something striking in every victim's appearance or behavior. Maybe a beautiful neck, wonderful eyes, coquetry and flirtation, or exciting impassivity. A swaying of hips that makes someone lose their mind; a too misty voice, a strange tone that would be good to hear while screaming. - That's right. The feeling of death. The victim can feel death. Tension, rapture and euphoria. This may you know that the time is near. Oh, gosh! - Maybe it's too late to talk about this. - Why would it late? Because I'm getting restless. I'm running out of time. Oh, so you're defeatist. You're shying away from the weight of the task. Just admit it, don't be shy. You came here and talked about everything, but now you chicken out. That's not true! But it can only go relentlessy and with a cool mind, you get it? If you find her, then you stick to her like a shadow. Go for sure this time. But how? Just tell me how. It's just fiction, Sonny, but it's a little dangerous. Put yourself in the place of the killer. Hey! Where are you going? There are no more subway trains. Stop! Don't take another step! Why did you yell, Vanda? Because I told him to stop, but he still came down. - Please, despite the warning, you... - There's no need to panic. I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. I just got scared. How much farther must we go? Let's keep going. - You really want to photograph of me? - Of course, I want to. I think you just wanted to lure me here, right? Okay, we're here. What a secluded spot. - You're not scared, are you? - Why should I be scared? A girl was killed here the other day. Don't you want me to be naked? I don't know what's happening to me. I'm tired. It's okay, no problem. But now I'd like to talk to you, okay? I have so much stuff to tell you that I came up with. You're not gonna laugh, are you? - Don't worry. Let's go away together to Zakopane this winter. You will rest, we will stroll a lot. We drink mulled wine and we'll dance every night. I have no more paid leave. But I had planned it all so well. I had to take my paid leave, and that's the truth. Hmm, well, you know. It doesn't bother you that someone is watching you? Ah, the counselor. Oh, come on, this is his only pleasure. His wife hasn't left her bed for years. I can understand him. Don't wait for me tonight. I'm feeling a little tired. You should get some rest, too. And tomorrow? I'll have a lot of work to do. So I can't see you tomorrow? Well, all right then, but not at the usual place. But why? I'm just saying. But you know what? Then meet me at the park terrace, and from there it's only a hop to my bed. I think I love her. Yes, and it's her who... It's absolutely... You know, some things are meant to be left alone. I mean, there's no need to rush things. There'll be plenty of time for that. I can still prove it a hundred times, after all. You're right. It needs to stop now. It's not worth it. I stopped it too. Why would we even be doing anything? Oh, the love... It's not worth it. Then someone else will finish it. This calls for a drink. - Then I'm gonna follow her. - Good. Excuse me, I don't want to interfere, but I've been through all this before. I go with you. And do you know what my wife said when I put the photos in front of her? She said I didn't notice even after twenty years that her right profile was much worse than her left one. What a bastard he is. Well, that's just who am I, like it or not. So you don't have to come anymore. But if you are here, then you shouldn't be surprised how I react. We need to get to know the other person. You told me, remember? It doesn't matter, so forget it. I'm sick of you. It's over between us. You don't mean that, do you? How should I think, huh? What else could I think? You're monopolizing and pressing me, you follow me like a shadow. Why don't you want more?! - Get out of my life. - Let's wait a little. Everything is gonna be all right. Sonny, you should stop doing this. Before the end? Like you? When you were scared? Stop it now. Believe me, I know. But why should I? Because you can't go through with this. Is that everything? Yes, that's all. Don't you want to ask me where have I been for so long? - Where have you been? - I was with a man. - You're lying. - You want to hear some details? I will not stand for this. I forbid you to do this again. Then you can get out of my life. You have no right to forbid me anything. You think your talk satisfy me? I realized that he is the only man for me. You know him, don't you? Because he can even fuck me against the wall... So then why are you here with me? Because you're dancing to my tunes. Take your sweaty hand off me. You loser. I'm only intersted in real men, little boy. With them anywhere and anytime. You're a sick man. Okay, relax, I'm just kidding. Please... Please, let me go. Please... You know, I just don't want to see anything bad happen to you. Please, just let me go. Nevermind, I don't want to see you anymore. I think it's best if you go home. I don't need your escort, I can go home by myself. So this is where we are in the case of Anna Bujdoso. And he's probably the same man who's murdered in the park. I don't think the picture is good, but in any event, we'll put an APB out tomorrow or the next day. - Give me one, too. - I've already put it to your photos. - How much do I owe you? - Don't meet him. - You start this shit again? Don't do it, please. Do you know where we're going tomorrow afternoon? There's a place where we will be naked, and where we can fuck, scream and moan. - How do you know this? He said he knows the place. You understand?! If you don't get out of here right now, I'm gonna sic my dog on you! I'm not listening this shit, you motherfuckers! - You foul-mouthed bastard! - Don't bark at me, every night you have sex here on the trash can with different men. Does your boyfriend know this? So he can insult me before you? You're not good enough to protect a woman. You little investigator. So tomorrow you'll go with him. Take a trash can with you. Now you get the hell out of here! Go away or I'll spit on you! - Hello. - Hi, Gustav. Uh, I can barely breathe. So, tell me what is so urgent? I hope you didn't call me here to talk about the photos, did you? Forgive me, but I'm a little overworked. But wait a day or two, and then I'll bring them, that's for sure. What are you drinking? - M?doc. - Cheers, then. - Cheers. Now I'm gonna drink this, and then I'm out of here. Let's forget about the photos. I don't need them. Neither these nor any others. I don't need more. - What do you mean? - Exactly as I say it. The case is finished. That's it, this is over. And now, we're gonna celebrate. Wow, I should have brought my ceremonial dress. I knew that you're the kind of guy I need in here now. Cheers! Now you listen to me, it's my turn. So, you will never guess what happened. - No, I will not. I got a message from the old man, he awaits me at three. Hmm, after all these years, nothing has happened until now, then the old man shows up, and you're here in this fancy place. Isn't that strange? Let's forget about the old man for now. Waitress, please. - Bring the largest portion for my colleague. - Something delicious crustacean will be enough. - Then bring the most delicious crustacean for him. - Mmm, she could bring some breasts, too. Gustav, you're a hedonist. Yeah, a hedonist. - Have a good lunch. - Whoa, thank you. Did you know that the identikit has since been modified? Yes, I know. The murderer wears shaded glasses. That's right. A big frame glasses. Cheers, then. Cheers. Are you sure you don't want to send a message to the old pops? - Why don't you forget about the old man? - Well, I simply asked. But you know what? Try to stay up at night. That's my message for him. It's worth it to him. Then, I'll just leave quietly. And thanks for the food. It was delicious. Uh, this stuff is so heavy. I'm taking some compotes to the old geezer. - See you later. - Goodbye. How is him? What do you know about him? I'm just coming from him. Oh, by the way, here are the photos. But all I care about right now is him. Calm down, he's excellent healt. You're kidding me or what? So...er... How can I say... He invited me for lunch, he is fine and he said he had to finish the work. He has finished his work?! Well, I don't know, he told me that he didn't need any more photos and now it's time for celebration. For God's sake, but didn't he send me a message? No, he didn't. I mean...how can I say... So I asked him if he wanted to send you a message. - Keep talking. - He said that it's just not worth it, and... Spit it out or I'll beat you to death! All right, so he said that keep awake tonight and you will see. - And what else did he say? - Nothing else. We were drinking, joking, talking... - What were you talking about? - About everything. About girls, foods, et cetera. He was in very good spirits, he laughed a lot, and he even wore a strange spotted tie. At first, I didn't know what was so weird on him, but after all, it really suited him. And he paid as much as he could. Now go away. Just leave me alone, okay? Come on, hurry. - Whoa, what a car. - Just get in. Light me a cigarette. Thank you. - Where'd you get this car? - It's not important. It's my friend's car. Too bad it's getting dark. I like twilights. Unfortunately, we can't go any further. The tires are too worn. Let's just stay here. Nobody comes around here. You hear me? You want to stay here? You don't think that, do you? Looks like we're gonna have to walk. - Let's just stay in the car. - Come on, get out! - But I don't feel like walking. - It's all right, come. Come with me. - Aren't you scared at all? - Don't be a child. It's bad enough to be alone here at night. You're not alone. I'm here with you. - This looks like a good spot. - I've been here before. Stop it!
