You can't buy this, but we can find you something like this, but- - I mean, that's one of a kind. Wait a second. Wait a second, wait a sec. I think you blocked up all these things because you don't want the customers to go over all through it, because you wanna limit what we do because it's so late. You don't wanna have to deal with us going all over the place. Here's, here's, I'm making a point, okay? - If you reverse, go that way, you'll get to aisle number five a little bit faster.

I thought, the holiday spirit, don't you, Tina? - Oh, yes. - And what about that little girl? She was so exquisite. - Oh God. The little dancer with the invisible baby Jesus. - Wait, are you talking about the dancer in the beginning? - Yes. - Who crushed the baby? - Yes! Yes, yes. - You saw that too? I was like waiting for this big gasp, but it was just an awkward moment. - Are you making fun of the girl? Or are you making fun of Jesus? - No, I'm not making fun of anybody. - No one's making fun of Jesus. - Well I must have missed it because I thought that she was- - Did you not see when she got, when she crushed the thing? - No, I didn't see it.

So, a little bird tells me you own your own bookstore. - She's had that bookstore for, what, two years now? - That's right, yeah. - Actually Bill, the gardening book I got you. That's where I got it from. - Oh. - Yeah, that was a find. We don't get books like that in the shop very much. - You should really check it out though. They have all these amazing old rare books there. You would really like it. - So a rare young lady sells rare old books. - She's a rare one. - Word of the night. - Well, let's drink to that. - Cheers. - All of us. (glasses clink) It's good. - Well, I hope you liked your pot pies. - Oh, it's great. (dishes clink) - They were vegetarian and gluten free. - You guys are sneaky. Sam does the same thing to me. I mean, it tastes so good. You can't tell the difference. It was really good. I hate to admit it.

I feel like you being an artist would love this. - Well, I'm not really an artist. - You are what you say you are, Sam. - Really? You think that's how it works? I wish that's how it works. If it was, I'd be in the NBA right now. - No, you're way too short. - Okay. That's not nice. You know, Spud Webb was 5'7". He won the dunk contest.

Let me give you some advice. Okay? - Yeah? (fork clinks) - Sammy, if you want to get a girl like that, you gotta start acting like a man. - Where is this coming from? - Want the truth? - Yeah. - Every day, you're smoking dope. You're drawing pictures. You're working at the Chocolate Factory, how many years? - No. Bill, no. - What? - No. You need to learn some boundaries because- - What? - You still talk to me like I'm a teenager. - Teenager? - Yeah. - In my day, teenagers were dying for their country at 17, 18, 19 years of age. - Are you talking about the war right now? - Not to mention the fact that you're still living under my roof. - Okay. Well not to mention the fact that I'm living under your roof. - I just said that. - Okay. - What do you mean okay? What? - You know what you need? - What? What do I need? - You need to get laid. - Excuse me. What'd you just say? - I said you need to get the old tugboat in the canal. - See this fork? See that hand? - Yeah. Alright, alright. Alright. - Wanna see what happens? - No, I'm just saying, Bill, really. I haven't seen you up and dancing like that in years. - What are you talking about? - Years. I mean, you looked like you were having fun. Why don't you just call her and ask her out? - You think I could take her out after I got drunk and messed up her daughter's house? - Maybe she likes bad boys. - Do you think I have a shot? - Yeah. I think she'll be glad that you called. Hey, you okay man? - Fine. - What's going on, Bill? (Bill weeps) - I miss your mother. - Yeah. Yeah. - I'm fine. Okay. Thank you. See this? - Huh? - Next time, make sure it's real pork. - This is real pork, Bill. - Like it doesn't have any MSG either, right? - I didn't cook it. I'm glad you're back though.

I'm glad that we're alone, 'cause I wanted to see if you wanted to maybe hang out sometime. - Okay (laughing). Kate's right over there. - Hi. - Hey. - I got your drawing. So you're trying to get me on some roller skates? Is that what's happening? - That's what, yeah. No, but it's, I should have been more upfront in the text I sent you. Tomorrow night, they're doing this thing at the, at the roller rink for, I know it's New Year's. - Um, I mean if it could be like a casual friends skating thing. - Fully, fully casual. - Like Mary and Mark could come. - Please. - Maybe. - Yeah. Yeah. - That would be great. More the merrier. - Okay. - I just meant it like a fun casual thing. - Cool, yeah, that would be fun. - Great. I do feel a little silly. I brought chocolates for you now though. Yeah. - Oh no, I'll take those. - Oh yeah. No. - Thank you. - Enjoy them. I'll be back tomorrow with a corsage. (both laugh) Yeah. Casual. Yeah. - Bye.

(gentle music) (gentle humming) (bottle clinks) - Oh. (bottle spritzes) Hey Bill. - Oh, Tina, you didn't have to stand out here in the cold. - I just came out when I saw the car lights. - Well. You look real nice. - Thank you. So do you. - Dude. I'm telling you, a lot of the most influential bands just have three members. Nirvana, Rush, Cream. - Destiny's Child, TLC. - TLC! Destiny's Child. - TLC, yes. - There's a ton. Black Rebel Motorcycle Club. There's tons, dude. - Love, love them. - It's the power of three.

Katie did the same thing. They're in cahoots. - I was just thinking, I wonder if they talked it over between them. - I'm glad they did, though. It's been a long time since I've been out like this. - Me too. Do you mind if I take my coat off? - Oh, of course. - I don't know whether it's hot in here, or I'm having hot flashes 'cause of you. - Oh, well (laughing). You don't think they'll mind if I take these. I need 'em for my coffee tomorrow. - No, no, go. So, you have a lovely daughter. - Thank you. - And I'm just curious, is her father, I mean, if I'm talking out of line here- - No no, no. He left when she was just a baby. There was a note. I think I burned it in the fireplace. - What an idiot. - I never heard from him again. - Never? - Never. - Well, he doesn't know what he's missing. - No. And he's the dumbass that missed out on Katie's life. Lucky me. Lucky me. (jazzy music) - Katie, you know, you were really something out there. - Me? - Oh yeah. - Mm-hmm, oh yeah. - Yeah. Almost as good as Mary. Not quite as good. - Oh. - Oh wow, okay, alright. - Okay. - But she had a better partner. - Oh, thank you, bro. - I don't know, I thought my partner was really moving his hips out there. - Oh yeah, we saw the hips. - Yeah brother, those hips don't lie. - We saw the hips. - [Announcer] Alright skaters, grab your partners.

But from the age of four, he started sketching. And I'm telling you, he could sketch right from the get-go, without any lessons. - Yeah. - Anyway, when June was back in the hospital 'cause she was battling cancer again, Sammy and I visited her every day. Sammy sometimes was there all day. And he said to me one time, he says, "Daddy, why is it that some of these other cancer patients don't have visitors?" And they didn't. And I didn't know what to say to him. Without me knowing it, he went over, and without them knowing it, he started to sketch each one of the ones that never had any visitors. And he gave each of them a picture. I said, "Why'd you do that, Sammy?" He says, "I just thought it would, you know, make 'em a little happier." That's Sammy. He's a better man than me. Better man than I am right now. - Well, you're not so bad. - I don't know about that. - Let's just not worry about anything for a minute, and finish that dance that we started. Okay? (gentle music) (people chattering) (light indistinct singing) - What? - You're not dancing. - Can we just stand here for a moment? (gentle music continues) (horns blaring) (distant cheering) (door slams) - Wow. They're really going for it, huh? Awesome. (gentle music continues) Happy New Year. How's that song go?

(fireworks crackling) So do you have any New Year's resolutions? That's such a dorky question. - No, that's not a dorky question. Um, yeah, I don't know. - I like New Year's, though. Some people always think I'm weird for saying this, but it's actually my favorite holiday. - Same. - Really? - Yeah. - How come? - It's like a clean slate, you know? You can start fresh. - Yeah, yeah, I get that. I usually think of like a fresh notebook. - Mm, yeah, exactly. - Yeah. - Except you're just saying that 'cause you sell the notebooks.

I just... - Huh? - I haven't had anyone over in so long. - Well, I haven't been out in so long. (both laugh) - I tell you what. - What? - You wait here. - Yeah? - And I'll go into the house, and bring out some drinks. And we can have a night cap on the porch. - But it's a little chilly. - Well, I'll bring blankets. It'll be super cozy. - Well, I may need one more kiss just to keep warm until you get back. (gentle music) - Well you wait right here. - Okay. - Thank you for walking me home. - Yeah, of course. I kinda wish we stole the skates.

Did you get lucky? - You're kidding, right? - No. Actually, I'm not. - Okay, Bill, I don't know where this is coming from. - Well, I gotta tell you something. I thought you were a gentleman. - What? - And you're not a gentleman. - What the hell are you talking about? - I thought you were somebody that I raised, and you're not that person. I can use some water. - Oh my God. - Get me some water. - Yeah, okay. (dramatic music) - Water, please. - You know what you just said to me was a terrible thing to say, right? - Yeah. - You do know that? - Yeah, do you know- - I'm not who you thought I was? Why would you say something like that? - Well she's not who you thought that she was. - What? - You don't just stick it in her the first date. - You have no idea what you're talking about. - She's not a bimbo. - You don't know what happened.

Trying to get a little more clarity. Here's a Life Alert I want you to wear. Now come on, Bill. You know you need to wear it. - You wear it. - We can keep him here for monitoring overnight. - Hey, no no no. I'm out of here. - Thanks, Doc.

How do you- No, I don't think he would've done that. Well, they're not gonna come right now, so maybe I'll come by in a little bit, and we can make a plan. Okay? I love you. Bye. - That's not at all how you were. Is everything okay? - Yeah. No, I don't know. Did your dad tell you what happened the other night? You know he took my mom out for like a New Year's date. - No way. I was encouraging him to do that. I didn't think he really would. - Well, it didn't end well. - What happened? - He left, abruptly. And they haven't spoken. - Damn it, Bill. - In his defense, it's a lot for anyone to take. - What do you mean? - My mom, um, well, she would call herself a collector. But she's like, a hoarder. She's a full-on hoarder. Like her house is totally, totally full of shit. - I'm sorry. - Anyway, I guess her house got, I don't know, someone like called it in to the city, and I mean, this has happened before. And she has to, we have to clean it, clean it up, or she won't be able to live there. And then she'll have to like live with me, or something. - You don't want to live with your mom? - I don't want to live with my mom. - We could trade. You could live with Bill, I could live- Is it too soon for me to move in with your mom? Well, let me help. I mean, like, moving stuff. - Yeah, that would be really nice. Thank you. (knocking on door) Hey mom. (knocking on door) Mom, you know the routine. - I didn't know you were bringing Sam. - Well, we're gonna need his help. And I also got that company from last time. (door clicks open) - Wow, so many treasures in here. - I invited someone, too. Her name is Beth and she, she's in the choir. I know a little secret of hers, so she can't really tell anybody at church about mine. (cups shuffle) (coffee pours) Oh well. A little energy boost. For the job. - Thank you, Tina. Bless your heart. I think I understand now why you have insomnia. - Um, okay, so, I brought some gloves. And I have a company coming to bring oversized trash bins. Mom is gonna help us to organize things into boxes, what- Mom. - Well. - We're dating. - Oh, how nice. (gentle music) (boxes thud) (items rustle) (gentle music continues) (boxes thud) - This is so embarrassing. - Oh, just a minute. Oh, and I've changed my mind. This chain goes to my bicycle. - That you can't find, and that is broken. It's broken, mom. If we're ever gonna get this house cleaned, you're gonna have to start getting rid of some things. - I know. - Okay? - I know, I'm not an idiot. - Okay, here you go. Thank you so much. - Whoa, whoa, whoa! - Mom. (gentle music continues) (boxes shuffle and thud) (tissue rustles) (music settles) (pictures shuffle) (tapping, shuffling in distance) (tissue rustling) - Thank you so much for coming. - Oh, sure. - I don't know if I should say something or not. - Well, wait, did she tell you this, bro? - No, that's what I'm saying. I saw a picture and I called you. She doesn't even know that I know. And I don't even know what I know. I saw a picture of her with her family, I guess. - Wait. That's so bizarre. But you don't know for sure that she has a family. You saw a picture. - That's true, it could not be her family, but there's multiple pictures of her and some dude and a baby. I mean. - Oh shit, put this out. - Give me that. Now! (gentle music) - Oh, you... That's really, really strong. I think you're gonna need my help, ma'am. - Did you see all the TVs? - You think that one works? - I mean, either way, it's cool. - Yeah. Oh hey, Beth. Right on, you cleaning out the fridge? Good. - Beth. What are you doing? - Oh, I was just checking expiration dates. - The expiration dates mean nothing, so put it back and get out of my fridge. - Oh, okay. I am so sorry. (door shuts) (Tina sighs) (metal clinks) - You too. (distant shuffling in house) (plastic rustling) (gentle music) (gentle music continues) - Just really, I can't do this anymore. I just can't do this anymore. - Beth, are you okay? - Oh, I can't do this anymore. - Well, that's okay if you need to go. I understand. - I don't think your mom's gonna understand. - Probably not. - No. - Beth? - Oh, Tina. I am so sorry, but I've done everything that I can do here, so I'm gonna have to go, (laughing) and I promise I won't tell anybody. - Good. Goodbye! Bye. Don't come back. She's stoned. - What? - Yeah, she smoked. She's been smoking, somebody got her high. - That's awesome, that's real? - Yeah, yeah it's real. - Where'd you get that? - Oh, oh I'm Ron. I'm from Texas. I'm a friend of Sam's. - I'm Tina, this is Kate. And that's my goose, and it's a keep! Okay, everybody get out of the house. Everybody with an orange shirt, get out of my fucking house! - I'm gonna go... - You hear me?! - Are you high? Did you get her high? - Well, I mean, we didn't convince her, or anything. - It was a bit more complicated than... - Awesome, okay, you can go. You can go, too. - I'm just gonna make sure Beth gets home safely. - I was trying to help. - Alright, you want to help? Why don't you take the donate box from the ironing board thing? Just the donate box. Please and thank you. - Okay, okay. - Mom. Mom, open the door. - No, it's too much, Katie, I can't do it. - You can do it. We've been here before. - I know! I live with this every damn day, Katie. I deal with it every damn day. I just can't, I can't. Just, just take it all. Just, just, just throw it all away. I don't give a shit anymore. - Are you smoking? - Oh, you want to take that from me, too? Fine! Just take everything! I'll just die here alone. Everybody will be happy. - Mom. I love you.

It's about job security. Because machines are never gonna replace baristas. And my cousin owns the shop already, so I'm practically a manager there. We could put your artwork up on the walls. Hey Sam, are you okay, buddy? I said we could get your artwork up on the walls. - That's, that'd be, that'd really be something. I just, sorry man. I can't stop thinking about this guy's face in the picture. I just don't understand. I'm so confused. - Right, well. If it's about her ex, or her other life, and all that stuff, I mean, she's gonna tell you about that when she's ready. - Ron, we don't know that it's her ex, though. We're assuming that. For all we know, she could still be with this guy. I could be the guy on the side. - Some guys like that. - Not me. - Let me tell you something about love, Sam. And what springs to mind is my favorite quote from Rilke, which is, "Each partner chooses the other to be the guardian of his solitude." - Wait. (cell phone ringing) - Ride- - It's Kate, it's Kate, it's Kate, it's Kate. Hey, hey Kate, what's up? - [Kate] You took the wrong box. Did you donate it already? - What? - Did you donate the box that you took? You took the wrong box. - Well, I mean, it was one of those, like, drop box centers. I don't even, I just put it through the- - [Kate] Can you get it back? Can you go see if you can get it back? - Right, but I'm saying, I don't even know if anyone's there. I can go check, but your mom has a lot of stuff. You think she'll even notice? - I had a bunch of my son's stuff in it. Shit. - So you do have a son. I actually saw a photo, or a few photos at the house, and of you, and I guessed your son and ex-husband, and I don't want to pry on your past relationships, but I wish you would have been a little more upfront with me about having a kid, because- - Okay, shush. - Kate? Are you okay? Whatever it is, you can tell me. - Yeah, they died. In a car wreck. (gentle breeze) - Kate, I'm so sorry. (phone thuds) Hello? (gentle melancholy music) (gentle music continues) (gentle music continues) (gentle music fades) (birds chirping) - It might be, did you look over there? Where is it, Sammy? (phone ringing) Oh, thanks. - [Phone Announcer] Your call has been forwarded to an automated voice message system. At the tone, please record your message. (phone beeps) - Hey Kate, it's me again. I just wanted to let you know I called the number on the donation box, but they couldn't track it down. So I went to all the donation centers in town, and I'm gonna keep looking. I'm not giving up until- (phone message beeps) until we, shit! (bowl thuds) - What are you doing? You know I like scrambled eggs. I hate oatmeal. - Oatmeal is good for your heart. Why didn't you tell me you went on a date with Tina? - Didn't know I had to. - Well, do you think you could've handled the situation a bit more delicately? - What situation? - What situation? - Yeah. - Walking out on Tina the other night. What do you think I'm talking about? - Probably. - Probably definitely. - Yeah, probably probably probably. - Okay, I gotta go. - Where are you going? Where are you going? I'm talking to you! What are you walking out on me for? - Okay, what do you need, Bill? - I'm the one who called it in. - You were the one? - Yeah. - You called it in on Tina? - That's right. - Bill, how could you do that? - Because nobody's gonna tell her the truth. She needs help. - So you just decide to just do it all by yourself? - No one else was gonna do it. - Oh my God, Bill. - Listen, listen. - Do you realize that I can't tell them this? I can't tell them this. - What? - You just made me an accomplice. - No no no, listen, listen. She's the sick person, you're a good person. And you got that from your mother. - Oh my God, Bill. - Wait a minute. Maybe I'm right and you're wrong, and maybe you're right and I'm- Oh, fucking guy.

What happened to the other artist? - Oh, we have a new artist working now. Yeah. - Not my cup of tea. It's a little unfinished or something. I don't know. - Hi. - Hey, Mary. - How are you? I didn't know you were working here. - Well, I'm moving up in the world. - Yeah, yeah, I can see that. - Yeah. - It's good to see you, it's been a while. - You too. How's your long-haired stallion, Mark? - (laughing) He's amazing. - Good. - Hi. - Um, just an Americano for me. - Americano. Uh, what do you want? I mean, to drink. Like, what would, can I- - I'll have an Americano, also. - Another Americano, thank you. - Um, hey thank you for giving me Levi's toy. - Yeah, of course. I feel so bad that, of course. - How did you, how did you get that back? - Truthfully, I was gonna keep that one for me. I mean, I didn't know, so, yeah. I'm glad that, Levi's a really cool name. - He was a really cool kid. Um, it's awesome to see your art on the walls. It looks so good. - I'm gonna go play my set. Hey. - Kill it, compadre. Have you seen Ron play before? - No. - He's so good. Do you want that to stay or to go? - To go. - Yeah, okay. - Okay, everybody's got their coffees and their lattes. - Mr. Vanilla, large. - It's a beautiful day out there. It's only getting better, everybody. It's getting better.

I just, um, I just wanted to see you. You know, it's been weird lately. Without Bill around. I'm packing up his things. You know, and going through all of his things, and I have to figure out what stays and what goes. - Yeah. - And I feel like I'm learning things about him that I wasn't supposed to know, you know? Like, I found, he got discharged. I found these letters. The day before they all went to fight, he got injured, and they wouldn't let him go. You know, so. And then none of his friends came home. Not one. And he regretted the rest of his life that he didn't die, which is so fucked up. And it got me thinking as I was walking about what I would regret. That's you, Kate. I just, I just can't imagine you not knowing what you mean to me. (gentle music) - I missed you. (gentle music continues) Would you like to come inside? - Yeah, I do. - It's so good to see you. (gentle music continues) (gentle music continues) (gentle music fades) (lid clangs) (ashes scrape) (gentle light music) (Tina sighs) (gentle music continues) (Tina inhales and exhales) (gentle music continues) (gentle music continues) - Anything about me strike you as different at all? - I don't know. I got nothing. - I'm an artist who's sold his work now. - Oh my God! You sold a piece? - Technically, yeah. - That's amazing! - Ron called me yesterday and told me a piece sold at the coffee shop. - What piece? - The monster chasing the girl, but actually he just really likes her. - I love that one. Aw. (door clicks open) (door shuts) (keys thud) - You know if I sell a couple more pieces, I could even pay for groceries.
