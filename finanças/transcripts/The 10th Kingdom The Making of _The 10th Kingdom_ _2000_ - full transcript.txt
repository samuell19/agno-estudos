(dramatic music) - [Voiceover] Welcome to the world of the 10th Kingdom, the new epic miniseries where fairy tales don't just come true... ...they're real! (dramatic music) - Ow! - [Voiceover] 200 years ago, the Brothers Grimm created a world where magic was commonplace, and destiny ruled peoples' lives. Imagine if that world was not a fantasy, but really existed, and still survives today. (dramatic music) That's what the creators of the 10th Kingdom have done. The descendants of the famous fairy tale characters are living in the 21st century, and the filmmakers have invented a world full of living legends. It all begins with an evil queen, whose grand plan to rule to rule the kingdoms involves turning the handsome prince into a dog. The dog is pursued by three trolls, and the man, who is really half a wolf. The dog's only means of escape is through a magic mirror, and suddenly the fairy story characters find themselves in Manhattan, a new world to them which they proudly call - The 10th Kingdom! - [Voiceover] Two ordinary New Yorkers become the key players in the 9 kingdoms' power struggles. The dog, formerly known as Prince, takes them back through the magic mirror, and their epic journey begins. (dramatic music) (swords clanging) - Rescue! (exciting music) - Wake up! Wake up! Or all is lost! - So what's happening is we're tracking in, and the zoom's loosening the picture rather than staying the same frame size. - [Producer] Um, Cameron, we've got a wind machine on this, so things will blow a little bit. - [Cameron] Okay. - [Simon] The genesis of the idea was reading fairy stories again, and everybody says how wonderful they are, but in truth, unless you're reading them to your kids, they don't really scare you like they did, they don't really kind of move you. - You see, we are taught and told these horrifying stories which are your fairy tales when we are very very young, and we love them because they horrify us, and they delight us. But in fact, they respond, I believe, and I'm quite sure I'm right about this, that they respond to very primeval fears which sort of human beings had before they became so sort of sophisticated as we are now. - In the area of fairy tales, much of the story takes place, and then the main characters Virginia and her father Tony go into, that in fact it is the world of fairy tales as we know it, but 200 years on. And happy ever after isn't quite what it was. - I just sort of thought, is there a way to take a modern audience into that world? - [Tony] Barman, bottle of beer, saucer of beer for my friend. - We only serve cocktails, sir. Cupid's First Blush, Some Enchanted Evening, A Long Slow Spell Against A Wall. - And I kept thinking, why can't somebody do a story like the Lord of the Rings where a group of people quite literally walk across Europe. - [Voiceover] The 10th Kingdom took over two years to prepare, and more than seven months to shoot. During that time, the production team filmed in half a dozen European countries. (peaceful music) (laughter) (peaceful music) - Ah. - Hi. You made it! - Yeah. We've been here quite awhile. - Oh, I didn't know it was a race. - I didn't know that was a path. - [John] He's a janitor who is just put upon by life, he has tried his best to raise this daughter whose his wife and her mother ran away years and years before, disappeared. And he's just one of those guys who thinks that if there's a rain cloud, it's going to be right over him, you know? No matter if it's sun shining everywhere else. - He brings to it an immense earthy reality, and he's immensely clever at turning this man whose journey in the film starts from being a cowardly lion, he's basically a cowardly lion, not a very nice man, who has given up on everything, into a funny, warm character. - Tony grows as a person in this, and he also sort of regains, I don't know if he's ever lost it, but reestablishes love that his daughter has for him. - I'll see you soon, okay? I really love you, daddy. - Hey. You haven't called me daddy since you were a little girl. Tony is a sort of tragic character being played by a comic actor. So what happens in that is that you've got a great deal of pathos mixed up with a great deal of sort of self-deprecating humor, and that's one of the ways I like to play most, and that's probably the thing I do most naturally. Hey, look at this. I saw this earlier. - Grimm? - They're all stories, they weren't made up, they're true! He was here 200 years ago. - Wow. - Grimm fairy stories, you remember those? I used to read those to you when you were a kid. - Yeah! - You used to sit on my knee. The one about the donkey who would only eat thistles. - Oh, that was House at Pooh Corner. - Yeah. - It's about Virginia's journey, along with her father, towards waking up, waking up to life, living life, living life to the full. - But what can I do all by myself? - Do not cling to what you know. Do not think, become. - I don't think Virginia knows who she is at the beginning of the film, but in the course of her adventure, I think she comes to terms with a lot of the things that she's never dealt with in her life. I mean I still have this uncontrollable urge to just go up to people and say, my mother left me when I was seven! (crying) You know, as if that will explain everything. And I miss her. And I hate her. And I miss her. My character goes through so much emotional turmoil in the course of this adventure. And so I think it's got the best of some of the greatest fairy tales in it. - You are nothing! She will crush you! - Her day to day motivation is to go home, and mine was that in the beginning as well, so I had a lot in common with Virginia in the beginning, and then I think like Virginia, we both sort of turn around, and stop looking back towards home, and we start trying to see where we are, and I'm sort of in that mode now. - [Swamp Witch] Who dares to enter the domain of the Swamp Witch? - Please don't hurt me, I'm just.... - Acorn? - Oh, hello. - But it's a weird version of The Wizard of Oz in a way. These people are sort of skipping down the Yellow Brick Road of this adventure, and they're all missing something in their lives, and by the end of it, they have found that, and it was always inside of them, as the old story goes. - Tony, no! What are you doing? - [Virginia] What? - Don't eat that apple! - [Tony] Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Why not? - Think about where you are. Snow White's cottage. - [Voiceover] An old stories with familiar titles are much easier to sell, as Simon Moore found out, when raising funding for the 10th Kingdom. - [Simon] If you say let's do Gulliver's Travels, then people know it as a masterpiece. If you say let's do an original work that nobody's ever heard of, then of course it's a much bigger deal to convince people that they should make it, when you also say, oh by the way, it's ten hours, then you're really setting up an enormous number of hurdles. [coughing and choking] So when Robert Halmi came on board and said, we'll make this, it was, it was fantastic really. - Something is different, and something is good, and something new, that what audiences want to see. You know, to go back to the old formats, and keep at it, there's no point. You have to be brave, you have to take chances, both in length, both in format, and content. - Go this way. - Oh my God. No way am I going in there. - [Robert] Brothers Grimm stories are just as much for adults as for children, so we are putting it back where literature already belongs, it's to the adults, and it's fantasy, it's dreamy. Reality is horrible. Read the newspaper headlines, you'll go sick. So we are trying to show a little hope that you can go back to your dreams, you can go back in fantasy land, and feel good. - You know, here's a question I never thought I'd be asking. What happened to Snow White after she married the prince? - She became a great queen, one of the five women who changed history. - Five women? - Snow White, Cinderella, Queen Riding Hood, Gretel the Great, and the Lady Rapunzel. They formed the first five kingdoms, brought peace to all the lands. But they're all dead now. Some say Cinderella's still alive, but no one's seen her in public in nearly 40 years. She would be nearly 200 years old. - It's midnight madness! It's queen Cinderella! (majestic music) - I am playing Cinderella, only she's 200 years old. - She's just had a lot of magic surgery. - (Ann-Margret) But she still feels like she's 17. She's queen of all queens. - (Jill Taylor) When we knew it was going to be Ann-Margret, I kind of quickly went out and bought fabric, knowing her coloring and what she looks like. Cinderella had to be kind of, she's 200 years old in the story, kind of a little bit of mutton dressed as lamb, but not too much. And so I just came up with a shape that I thought would work for her, and faxed it to her, and waited for a response. And she called me on my mobile one night and said she loved it, and we just went ahead and cut it, and we had like two days to get it ready. - [Voiceover] The 10th Kingdom is full of power-hungry queens, and courtiers, and dwarves, and fairies, and farmers, and soldiers, and troll armies, and ball gowns. Jill Taylor had to organize over 4,000 costumes. - My brief all the way through was fantasy but with a bit of reality as well, so something that could come from either set of kingdoms, so the 10th Kingdom, you know, our world, or their world. So it's been kind of a fine balance to try and achieve. We're doing a little lamb village, and it's got to be kind of traditionally English, tweedy, rural, agricultural, farming, you name it. - [Old Man] The Peeps have all the magic now! - [Jill] The Peep family in this story are the ones who have the magic wishing well, and so everything that goes through this magic wishing well comes out heightened and plump and lush and wonderful. So you've got the rest of the farmers who are kind of a bit poor and down the heel, and then these Peeps who just look wonderful, like a bit like Stepford wife kind of feel about it, sort of. But everything should look pretty pretty and perfect and wonderful. This form would look good on Robert, with orders, putting orders and stuff on it. He's got that colored shirt, a bit dandyish. - Where is Wendel in our hour of need? Where is he? He was supposed to be performing prearranged acts of bravery before his coronation, and now there's a real crisis, he's just run away. He's, he's not fit to be king. Write that down. Put it down. Put it down! - It's a challenge in as much as the schedule was so tight, so we had to get things out really really quickly. I mean it's easy if you have a lot of time, but we didn't. We did this ball in a week. We got this ball together in a week. So, it was like kick bollock scramble for a week. We just didn't sleep. - Place your bets please. - [Voiceover] The scale of the 10th Kingdom made it a challenge to everyone who worked on it. - Excuse me miss, what's the highest return possible-- - [Voiceover] One of the two directors, Herbie Wise, remembers his feelings when he first got the script. - First of all, my agent rang me and said, there's a script on its way to you, he rang me on a Wednesday, and he said, they, they being the producers, they want to talk to you on Friday. I said fine, you're expecting to read a script in a half a day, and then the doorbell rang, and there was a cyclist, you know, with a script, and it was a pile about that high! - You won the jack rabbit jackpot! - I couldn't believe it, so I rang my agent back, and I said, you expect me to read all this and be intelligent about talking about it on Friday? He said, I'm afraid that's what it is. - One more for the pot, dearie. - So I was up the best part of two nights reading it. And when I first read it, the first few pages, I thought oh dear dear dear, this is not for me. But I don't think I got more than five or six pages in, and I was hooked, and from then on, I knew I had to do this, and I fought hard and long to get into this, and I got into it. - Congratulations, sir! Ten thousand gold coins! - Have you got Mr. Bun the Baker Man? (laughter) Read 'em and weep, oh poor baby, look at my happy family! - [Voiceover] High up in the Austrian Alps, a truck hauling a key part of the 10th Kingdom set is nearing the end of its long journey from England. (peaceful music) - [Julian] What we're doing is we're pre-building nearly everything in the studios here, and then taking it out in lorry loads and just directing it on site, because we've only got a six week period in Europe for the filming, so we know all the places we're going, and we've recce'd them repeatedly, and so when we go in we'll just erect all the sets very quickly and paint them and film and get out, and that's a very fast process really. - [Voiceover] Built a thousand miles away at Pinewood Studios, the journey of the jaw is finally over. - [Tony] Well, we found the dragon. - [Virginia] It's not breathing any fire. - Prince! - [Voiceover] Seamlessly blending studio sets and real locations was a major challenge for the production designers. - [Rob] One of the deciding factors was to make it fantastical, and not present such a marked difference between the created sets and the fantastical sets, and the outside world, because often that's quite difficult to pull off, because you don't get the opportunity to light outside in a strange and fantastical way. - [Tony] What's that, huh? That's the place. - [Rob] It's turning a nursery rhyme into a real place. Not in any sort of theme park sense, but to make it look real like these people really were sheperdesses, and they were out in the fields. - Morning! - Morning! My name's Sally Peep. If my door wasn't locked, - Yeah? - I'd be scared you'd come into my house, and huff, and puff, and blow all my clothes off. (growling) - [Virginia] Ok, let's go. - The main hall of this Tudor building had to turn into a courtroom for the Little Lamb village. - Any jury can be swayed. All you need is a-- (sheep bleating) Oh my god. - [Rob] And I had to build a jury box for sheep to be the jury, and you don't often get asked to do that as a production designer, so it wasn't terribly difficult, but it amused me to do it. - It gives me no pleasure to sentence this wolf to death! - As you watch it, we hope that you believe that Little Lamb village is a real place. - [Judge] Those who know him to be guilty, go into the right hand pen. - The right hand pen is full of food! - [Wolf] It's full of food! (yelling and hubbub) - Wolf! - [Rob] You want it to be fantastical, but very real, three dimensional. These people, we really want people to believe that they exist, and our New Yorkers have to interact with these weird and wonderful people. - Is that hand, one o'clock, and the little hands go around and it tells time, very intricately. - We call them watches. (screaming) - [Voiceover] The 10th Kingdom may be ten hours about myth and magic, but the relationships are firmly grounded in an earthy reality. - If I'm going to earn ten hours, then on a character basis, on the basis of the relationships, you've got to explore something profoundly and use that time well. - [Tony] Where's the wood? For the fire? - Oh, I couldn't find any. - Couldn't find any wood? In a forest? - [Wolf] Hello, Tony. - You don't have any wood either. - Yes, thank you. - [Simon] I think as the story develops, I hope the audience realizes that there's really quite a strong bond being explored both bewteen the daughter and the father, who haven't had a chance to really spend time, real time together, and communicate, and also this incredibly unusual love story between Virginia and a man who at first appears as anything but a romantic interest. - You. - Hello! - What are you? - Ssssssh! Half wolf. - [Simon] What happens for the first part of the story is that a lot of people are going, what is this? Who are these people, and what's going on? The big question for me was how to introduce the character of Wolf, how to come up with somebody who could be completely off the wall and crazy, would nevertheless be endearing and intriguing. - [Wolf] Tasty! Remember what you came here for. A wolf's gotta eat, hasn't he? I smell dog! - To me, the scene where Wolf is first confronted with a New York diner menu, - [Wolf] Lamb! Ahh! New seasons lamb I hope. There's a lamb filet, or a nice fat rack of chops! - And realizes that there's more than one way to cook lamb. - [Wolf] When I say rare, I mean just let it look at the oven in terror, and then bring it out to me. No fries, no vegetables, just meat! - And he can have it all. - Born to gorge. That's me, haha! - Is probably the key scene for me, because I think if the audience liked that, then they're going to like the series. - Ok, so you got the lamb special, and six glasses of warm milk. - Yeah! I was completely convinced that they would cast a star, and that I would never be cast for this part, so I called my agent, and said I love it, I adore it, I think it's fantastic, this is the very thing that I've always dreamed of doing, and I'll never get it, so why are we even going to like go down that road? - [Wolf] Please! Uggggh! You are one dynamic lady! Uggggh! (howling) There was never a question in my mind of how to do it, like usually like if I'm auditioning for something I have to like read it, and I have to look at it, and I have to say, well, I can do this, and I can do that. This was like I read it, I knew how to do it, and it was just about like feeling free to do that. - Scott has done it completely successfully, that of being this animal, and yet being human. And the animal is not offensive, but it is just exciting, and the human is not quite human, there's always that delay of the animal with him, and that's a very very clever way of doing it. - What is that? - It's not very big at this time of month. It's just a little brush. - You've got a tail? - Yeah, so? You have succulent breasts, I don't go on about them all the time, do I? Why don't you touch it? It won't bite. (gasping) - What? What? - With the fur, not against it! (laughing) There are times when it really needs to be over the top, because it just, it, I mean, there's a section where I tie Grandma up, and I'm about to eat her, so it's not like I could like, underplay that. I'm so bad! I can't believe I'm doing this! Still, I suppose you would look better surrounded by potatoes! (hysterical laughter) Where's the garlic? The rosemary? What do I have to work with here? Three year old dried herbs? Surprise! Aaaah! (screaming) You're fantastic! She's brilliant. What a dreamy-- Scrumptious. Creamy girl! She's beautiful, adorable. Tasty or what! She provides for him a purpose in his life, I mean he brings her through this story I think, I think that he's her guide. - [Robert] We are looking for somebody who could have been a wolf in a life before, and we needed somebody who was sexually threatening, and you know, this is a major story between Kimberly and the Wolf. And it's not easy, that's the most difficult part in the movie, to act as a human in love, but somehow your heritage is, that you're a wolf, that line in the movie that I don't know whether to kiss you or eat you is, that's it. - I met this terrific girl, and I really really really like her, but the thing is-- - Go on, say it. Say it! - I'm not sure whether I want to love her, or eat her! - I've always loved films where people are trapped as animals, I think it's a fantastic opportunity to get straight from A to Z in terms of personality. - [Daniel] I was watching the film Where Eagles Dare, they shot that in this castle with Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood, sort of being very good, and I don't know, I just thought that they had never played dogs in their career, and it sort of upset me a little bit that they hadn't, and that I have, and I'm making a complete fool of myself. (growling) - What's great is you can see that actors respond to this as well, you know you say, well, you know, half man, half golden retriever, and it's a chance to stretch your skills. (sniffing) - [Queen] Stand up. - But now I'm doing all my own barks and panting and associated dog noises. - Stand up properly. - I'm scared. - [Queen] Of what? - I'll fall over. It's such a well-written role that I was sort of quite excited to do it, but I couldn't get over the embarrassment of actually having to tell people that I was playing a dog. - You are not a dog. You are Prince Wendell, you are ruler of the 4th Kingdom. - Prince Wendell loves biscuits. (panting) - Get dressed. (barking) - [Voiceover] While the actor struggled to be a dog, a real dog struggled to learn to act. - [Wendell] I am Prince Wendell, grandson of the late Snow White, and soon to be crowned King of the 4th Kingdom. - A lot of developments recently have enabled you to have talking animals and things. I think that's fun, but I really wanted to go back a stage and just say, well there's only one person who can hear this rather irritating, aristocratic dog. - [Wendell] Manservant, I need to go up on deck. Bring a bucket and a shovel. - [Trainer] On your feet, wait. Good! On your feet, wait. - [Voiceover] This is dog trainer Gill Raddings, working Tanner, one of the two 10th Kingdom dogs. - [Trainer] Good! - [Gill] The length of time taken to train a dog varies enormously on the behaviour. Some behaviours, like doing positions, crawling on your stomach, are quite quick and easy to train. Others like shaking the head, hiding your eyes, take quite a long time. And you build up. You know, the more a dog learns, the more it's receptive to learning other things. Straighten up! Once we got sets up, I actually brought him down and trained him on the set with people working around him that -- So he's trained to go and stand on that mark, so we know he will always be in exactly the same place. -- just to get him used to it, because obviously, he'd never been on a film set in his life, it was a big show to start as a novice film dog. Sit up! Sit up! Good! Sit up! Good boy, stay. Stand up. Stand up. Stay. Stay. Good! When he had to do the nudging, he has to chase a lamb into a pen, which we trained the lamb and the dog together, and he's trained to nudge it. Everyone thought it was a nightmare scene really of the whole film, and that we'd never get it right, and we'd probably have to adapt the script. The fact that it went perfectly on the first take, everyone clapped and it was one of those spontaneous things, that was great. - [Wendell] Get in that pen, you disgusting little woolly jumper. - I have to say, the three leads have been really good with him, great, and they've all fussed him, and they make a, you know, give him a lot of attention, and help me, and particularly Kim. Kim and Prince have got a real love affair, he absolutely adores her, and she's been really helpful, and he will follow her anywhere. - I love Prince. We've had two, actually. We had Prince in England, and then we have Tanner out here. And they're both wonderful. I've never spent this much time around a golden retriever before, and they've got two separate personalities, and they're both very affectionate, and I go home at night and I hear the trainer's voice in my head going speak, speak! Stay, wait! - [Trainer] Prince, stay! Look here. Good, Princey, over, come, Prince! Over! - They're good, they hit their marks better than the actors, these dogs, and these animals. We've got golden retrievers, rabbits, horses, fish, we've got all kinds of animals in this project. And all the animals are better behaved than the actors. - [Voiceover] The worst behaved characters on screen are undoubtedly the trolls. - It starts with Dad, who is Relish the Troll King. (whooshing) Dad is consistently disappointed in us, because we, we just we, we just can't get up there and do the whole conquering thing that he's done. - [Relish] You make me ashamed. - Sorry Dad. - Sorry Dad. - It won't happen again. - And the odd thing is that a lot of the trolls, when I see them out of the makeup, they don't resemble the troll at all. They look totally different. But unfortunately, I find that I look a little bit like a troll. - And I had not read a script like this in a long long time, and certainly, nothing like Burly the Troll. - I am Burly the Troll, feared throughout the nine kingdoms. (spitting) This could be a long torture session. - I'll tell you anything you want to know. - Alright, torture first, then you talk. It's better that way. Rush a torture, ruin a torture. (laughing) - Myself and Jeremiah, who's playing Bluebell, we actually auditioned together, and I'm convinced I got the part because at one point, they said, well just get, get really physical! So in the middle of the scene, I picked Jeremiah up, and threw him across the room. And uh, well, here we are! - I am Bluebell the Troll, terrified throughout the nine kingdoms. Very very very close family. Love each other so much. Actually, we all have different mothers, so I haven't seen mom in awhile. I think dad might have eaten her. - I am Blabberwort the troll, dreaded throughout the nine kingdoms. And after almost an hour and a half of makeup, you don't know who we are. Actually this is part of my face right here, this is Dawn Blabberwort in a bag. That's my character's name, Blabberwort. Very sexy, very enticing, and fun. These are my ears. So that goes on, and it's full of earrings, and studs, and all kinds of fun things. (horns blaring) Because this is after happily ever after didn't work out. Ok? No one's happy, everyone's got a chip on their shoulder, just a little bit of attitude. (axe crashing) - Our carriage is here. - Michael Keaton, when he played Batman for the first time, and something that Jack Nicholson said to him that is so true, and he turns to me, he's going through this whole thing, he was like aah, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know how, you know, Batman, I mean people expect from me, and Jack Nicholson turns to him, and says kid, just let the costume do the acting for you. And that's the truth, man! - I'm always perplexed when people think that I'm in some way bizarre, I just sort of think, that you know, there's a whole world of storytelling, and this is a perfectly natural thing to do, to me, that you only have to think, well, if I was six foot five, and 300 pounds and believed that everybody was out to get me, how would I behave? And then you have the trolls really. (axe crashing) - [Voiceover] When the team were not traveling across Europe, they were based at Pinewood Studios near London. Over 150 sets were built using eight of the largest sound stages. - You sort of judge it in lorry loads, really. It was about half a million pounds worth of plants that we hired in, About sort of ten lorry loads, I think 120 trees, and over 160 tons of topsoil, because we sort of built the ponds first, and filled the soil up around it, and acres of turf, and it's got so much turf, you wouldn't believe it, enough to cover a couple of football pitches, I think. - [Tony] Is it just me, or can you hear A Whiter Shade of Pale? - It's just you. - No, no, that's Procol Harum, that organ is unmistakeable. Listen, listen, listen! ♪ Skip the light fandango - No, that's an animal howling. - No, I don't think so. I mean, what animal can skip the light fandango? - [Julian] Then the very strong green cross light is what kind of lifts it out, when the ordinary lights are on it, it almost looks like a night club set, but as soon as you sort of get the weird light and the atmospherics in, and the bubbling pools, it suddenly starts to come alive. You know, you do need all the other elements to make it work really. - [Kimberly] This is a gorgeous set, I think. They're all really gorgeous, but this one has particular biological issues. We've got water growing real mushrooms, we've got real plants, real grass, a lot of water being misted into the set, and this is great, because it's alive and dead at the same time. (mushrooms singing) ♪ And although my eyes were open ♪ They might have just as well've been closed ♪ And so it was, that later - [Voiceover] June 1999, in the 20th week of a 30 week schedule, the 10th Kingdom film crew are shooting by the lakeside in Hallstatt, Austria. - [Director] Action! - What in the fairying forest do you think you're doing? (banging) Listen Lewis, you little prison princess, throw that mirror on that boat now. - Well an example of the way we work with real landscapers, this set behind us is actually been built here because of the view over here. - [Director] Action! - [Mitch] This fantastic view, which when the camera faces in that direction is behind the actors, we have to show the actors coming out of a castle, so we've built the bottom bit of the castle here so the actors can interact with it, and they come through, and it's all very realistic. - Yes! - [Peter] In order to sort of set the tones for the 10th Kingdom, a lot of pre-production work went on in terms of the design and choice of locations for each kingdom. We had to sort of enhance that with certain aspects that obviously can't be achieved physically. It's a fantasy orientated story, so therefore a lot of the environments have been created digitally. (dramatic music) Because the whole story revolves around the 10 kingdoms, and we've tried to create looks for each individual kingdom, in that the matte painting department has designed a lot of wide vistas, incorporating a lot of the location shooting that has been going along in Europe. (dramatic music) We've sort of approached the visual effects from sort of very much a narrative point of view. It's not a sort of visual effects show, and the visual effects that we're doing are kind of there to sort of back up the narrative aspects. - [Voiceover] Magic is everywhere in the 10th Kingdom, and becoming invisible is commonplace. (magical whooshing) Relish the Troll King has the ability to put on a pair of magic shoes and turn invisible. We needed to design an effect that we could tell the audience that the character was there, but at the same time, not destroy the illusion that he is invisible. We went about the role by designing a sort of what we call a jellyfish effect where he would distort the background through a refracted image, so in other words, whenever he was moving, you would be able to see a distorted refracted background image that would form the outline of the King, and once he stopped moving, he would then sort of, chameleon-like, blend in to the background set. - [Director] There will be no glass there, darling, we will not ask you to walk through the glass. - Thank you! - Yes. Is that what's worried you? - And a hand will really come out? - It's your hand going in, darling. - My hand? My hand goes in, and then I follow my hand in? - Yes. (magical whizzing) - So some of them I think are very big effective things that are impressive, tableaus in themselves, such as some of the mirror things, and some of the locations that we see. The queen for instance uses the mirrors like a mobile phone, and she goes along and she barks into the mirror. - Moron! - And in another place, one of the trolls bashes on his mirror and goes, knock knock knock! - [Troll] Hello? Hello? Hey, come here! It's the queen! - We've done a lot of research and development on this, and we've come up with a kind of combination of tubes and filters and glass, and various things, and we're able to create a mirror like this which reflects enough that with a correction electronically in a computer we can make look as if it wasn't blue. We can insert at anytime the picture that the queen sees when she's standing in front of it, or have it just reflect her. We've got a kind of little filter which we use which corrects it automatically. Maybe the audience can see the effect here. And that actually shows us what the mirror would be like if it wasn't blue. - [Voiceover] Most people on the 10th Kingdom worked in studios and on location, but Dianne Wiest, playing the Queen, had a very different experience. - The good guys, Kimberly Williams and Scott Cohen and John Laroquette have to travel through many, many places while I stay in a bedroom talking to them through mirrors, or trying to talk to them through mirrors. The only bad part about this experience is that I had to talk to a lot of mirrors, which is not great fun. You'd much rather be talking to an actor. - [Director] Turn it up. - [Assistant] 726 take one, A and B cameras. - You're dead, you hear me? - Cease fighting immediately, or you will be overrun, and we will lose this kingdom! Do you understand? (spitting) - I'm taking the kingdom, then I'm coming for you, you evil pig! You evil pig! - [Page] Your majesty, the prince has escaped! - [Director] And we cut. - [Assistant] End board! - [Director] Sorry, end board. - [Assistant] 725, take one, on the end. - [Voiceover] It's not all done with mirrors. Some spectacular effects are done with computers. - [Virginia] Central Park. - The portal mirror was one effect that we had to apply visual effects to. The characters were shot against blue screen where they were able to walk through an empty frame, and we had to enhance all of the travelling aspects of the mirror journey. We started by moving the mirror through a virtual environment so that each mirror image would show a segment of time. It was very much a collaboration between all of the artists, the shooting on the sets, the directors, the producers, all determining what visual effects are required for the show, so that the visual effects don't take away from that very strong narrative drive that's present in Simon Moore's script. - [Voiceover] To some, the 10th Kingdom is an epic road movie. To others, it's a costume drama, or a comedy. For audiences of all ages, it's a challenging and complex adventure story that defies easy definition. - [Simon] I think there's a tendency more and more with programs to say, watch this, because it's just like everything else you've seen,and it'll be fine, and you know, you won't be troubled, and there's nothing confusing. I kind of want to take a step back from that, and just say with this, it is different, it's meant to be different, I think if you watch it, you will have fun, and hopefully you will be moved, and I certainly think you'll be taken courtesy of all the fantastic people working on it on the most amazing journey.
