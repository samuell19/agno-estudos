Find. Where must it be hidden? "Brother, Raju." "Brother, Raju." Boys, I have found the goods. Where is it? Where are the goods? You must have seen pigeons eating seeds. But have you ever seen them eating gold? Look at this. How did you find this? Open the locker. What brains he has? They are JK's men. Let's run from here. Come on brother Raju, let's go from here. Come on, Raju. I don't feel like going after seeing the gold. You take care of them. I knew it. Have you gone mad? Hey, who are you? Brother JK, he is Raju. After a long time we have trapped you. So will kill you today. Shall I kill you? Shoot if you want to but I don't want unnecessary howling. My boys ran away the moment you came. I also could have run away. But what to do. Lions never run away. JK, I want to talk to you, rascal. It is private. How did you come to know about gold? Who informed you about this? Will they inform such thing on news? For this there should be an informer in the gang. Who is he? The one who stammers.. What was his name? Andheri Balram. - Yes. I do not know whether he is Balram of Andheri or Borivali He would be the one. He is the one. Brother, don't believe in what he says. Raju is very smart. He is trapping you in talks and making you fool. Fine. In every gang someone or the other does cheating for money. Don't listen if you don't want to. I am leaving. Sit down. Go. Tell me. If I get a small drink then it would be interesting. Sure. I am sitting with you believing in your talks. But understand one thing clearly. If anything wrong happens.. ..then I will chop you into pieces. Now tell me. What? - Come near, buddy. JK.. Sir.. If anyone makes a move then I shall cut his throat. What were you saying, uncle? That you will chop me into small pieces. I will decide about my death. I will also decide about your death. Did you think that I am a pigeon.. ..which will fly away after hearing the sound of crackers? I am the eagle that sits and does hunting. Come on. Why don't you say anything? Our brother Raju is a fool. His men attacked us and he was standing there and watching gold. JK's men would have killed us. - Yes. Raju has not come yet. That means he will come with the gold. Or he will get the men. Forgive me. I made a very big mistake. You must never think of side money without finishing the work. First finish the work. Here work is not done on a piece of paper but on faith. Deal of crores is also done on faith and not on agreement. Then why have you started doing wrong things? Now make a call. Call up. And return all their goods. Jaggi, return all the goods. Do as I say. Your intentions changed after seeing the gold. Isn't it? JK, if next time you do like this then I shall kill you. Half a bullet is enough for you. Come. City of dreams..Mumbai. Everyone come here with his dreams. Here beautiful women rule the nights. And the days are ruled by their lovers. Such are two loving and young friends have come to Mumbai to try their luck. Raju and Chandu. People swear upon their friendship. Both can die for each for friendship.. ..as well as kill someone for their friendship. They are Mumbai's unknown prince. After ruling entire Mumbai their dream is now to rule the entire country. Raju, as sharp as spicy chili and as clever as a fox. But very cool and stylish. And Chandu is as fast as a bullet and is of angry nature. He kills first and then talks. Beware underworld as two strangers are on the way. Chandu and Raju. The day the new and brave police commissioner made an entry in Mumbai.. ..he targeted Raju and his gang. He destroyed all the illegal businesses of Raju and his gang. And arrested his close friends. Johnny, Manish and Dev..were arrested at last. I knew that he would interfere. What does he want? Will we have to give bribe to every police officer? What does he think of himself? We did not give him bribe so he is after our lives now. Are we the only ones who are doing this business in Mumbai? That rascal just arrested our men. Go and give him money. Where are we going? - I have to go and meet a girl. Will you marry her? Come quietly. I am coming. What is this brother Raju? Where is the girl? What is this brother Raju? Where is the girl? Wait for some time. Rain. What is going on there? Shooting is going on brother of a Punjabi movie. Now, everyone listen carefully. As I say rain everyone will run towards water. Okay. Understood. Did you see brother, Raju? He will fool the public by showing the scene of rain. Come on start the rain. Come on start the flow of water. You all wait here. What is this? I was saying that.. The shooting is happening here and where are you throwing water, idiot. Why are you looking at me? Go and see what is happening? Why is it raining that side? What are we to do with that? The director asked us to run towards the rain. So let's go. Open your umbrellas. Come on you also open yours. Hey, come here quickly. What is happening here? Sir, the shooting of Punjabi movie is going on. Do they have the permit to do shooting here? They must be having that is why they are shooting here, Sir. Go and ask them to stop. Where were you all? Go and ask them to stop. - Listen, son. You go and sit with Gia in the car. Why are you getting wet? Gia is not in the car. I don't know where has she gone? Gia.where has she gone? Commissioner had given the permission of shooting. That is why I kidnapped his daughter from there. Tell him that if he wants his daughter back before marriage.. ..then he will have to release all our men that he has arrested. Commissioner sir, your daughter is absolutely safe with us. But there is no guarantee as to till when she will remain safe. Release all our men that you have arrested only.. ..then your daughter will return back home safely. I am not scared of your unnecessary threats, understood. What did you think that I will release your men? Listen to me carefully. Your end has just started. So don't call and threaten me again. Search every nook and corner of the city. - Yes sir. Pull them out from the corner wherever they are sitting. - Yes sir. Neither Raju nor Chandu should escape. Move. Sir. Sir. - Tell me what is it? Sir, it is child Gia's wedding. All guests have arrived. Sir now is not the time to be stubborn with them. Sir, we can arrest them again. As it is they will not leave Mumbai and go anywhere. We will arrest them again. God is great. Yes, Chandu. Raju, commissioner has released our men. Go and drop his daughter back. Hey, commissioner has agreed. Go and drop the girl back home. Take this. - Okay brother. Child Sara, go and give the towel. Excuse me. Can't you drop me after two hours? What? If I go now then the marriage will take place on time. That is why.. Give me the keys. So what is the problem from marriage? I had prayed to God to do a magic and this marriage does not take place. And the rain started at the correct time. I was thinking of exit and you made an entry. Just as hero and heroine walk under one umbrella in movies. In the same way you got the umbrella like a hero and made my work easy. You have not kidnapped me but I have kidnapped myself. What is the matter? Why don't you want to get married? The groom should be nice. Neither anyone fell in love with me nor did I fall in love with anyone. My father is a commissioner and I am getting the punishment. That is correct. How will we spend these two hours? Don't you have any plan? Plan? Hey, look.. What is the matter? There is a theatre.. Two hours will pass easily. Brother Raju, Raju..you got married. And did not call this beard man in the marriage. It is not good that you did not invite me. That is not the case. Sister-in-law Raju is a very nice man and you are very lucky. We have come to see the movie, understood. Movie.. Okay, I will get the ticket, sister-in-law. Come this way Raju. Come. I have taken sofa seat for you. Come. Be careful, it is dark. Come. Come. Sister-in-law. Come. Sister-in-law, this side. Where should we sit? You will be able to see full screen. I shall get cold drink for you. Thanks. It's okay, I have done earlier also. Actually I.. On seeing you I came to know dear.. That love is crazy, dear. Where will we go from here.. I am telling that they do not know Hindi. I have seen this movie 40 times. I very well remember every dialogue of it. Brother Raju, this is cold drink. Why did you get this? Love increases when you drink together. Okay bye sister-in-law. Don't talk in front. Yes. - Where are you? I am watching a movie in the theatre. Where is that girl? - She is also watching. Hey, it is her marriage. Commissioner has called five times. Look, deal is a deal. He has released our men so go and drop her daughter quickly. Chandu, that girl does not want to get married. Hey, then what can we do? Just drop her home quickly. - Okay. Hey, come on. The movie has just started. You have already seen it 40 times. Hey, one minute stop here. Thanks. Hey. Stop the car. Stop the car. She is commissioner's daughter. Stop the car. Hi. You seem to be happy. Has the marriage got cancelled? That is why I came to the temple to thank God. I had to thank you also and you made an entry. Take this. And put it on your forehead. Thank you so much. Bye. Wow! Brother you look very nice in that vermillion on forehead. I was born handsome, buddy. What should we do now, Chandu? What is the problem of that commissioner? What does he want from us now? Now if his daughter is missing again.. ..does not mean we have kidnapped her again. Call the commissioner and say that we have not done this. He is after our life. - What happened? The moment he sees our men he puts them behind bars. That girl is missing again. And commissioner is putting our men behind bars. Hello, is commissioner sir there? I am Raju speaking. Did you recognize me or not? I have kidnapped your daughter. We both are going to get married after eloping. Is it fine? What are you doing? Just use your brains. Do as I say. Don't get confused. Raju's way of speaking is just like a lion. And you are threatening just like a dead man. Here, give me the phone. Hey Commissioner I am Raju speaking. I had warned you earlier also but you did not bother. You just have one daughter. Now you talk. - I understood. Okay. Commissioner sir.- Superb. I.. Speak. Come on speak. Actually my father has fixed my marriage again. That is why I was using your trick. Come.. Sir, if you arrange marriage of your daughter.. ..then she will keep doing like this. Your daughter wants to fall in love. And till now she has not found one. Boys come till your house but run away after seeing your uniform. Take a leave for some days and go for a holiday. And talk to her. He has told her story to a stranger like me. Just find out what she wants. And then get her married. Now if she runs away again then don't arrest our men. Get in. yes. Hi. - Hi. Thank you so much. The way you talked to my father really helped me. Father took a leave and spent time with me. He took me to Switzerland. He also told me to find my own life partner. But there is one tension. I don't know how and what kind of a life partner should I choose. I want your advice. Will you help me? Please, please. Your feet are not on ground. You are still immature. Just be careful. Think coolly and then take a decision. Come on sit. What happened? - Nothing. Brother Raju.. She is looking at you. Hey! Hey, stop the car. What is the matter? I have chosen my partner. I thought a lot about it. Okay. I have decided coolly. Look my feet are on the ground. Who is he? You are the one. Are you mad? Yes in your love. "I am 16 going on 17." "Why will the heart not beat fast?" "Why will the heart not beat fast?" "My youth is in my control but still I feel incomplete." "Oh dear." "Without you." Brother Raju, look who is calling? Earlier commissioner used to call and now his daughter is calling. What? How did she get my number? She is commissioner's daughter so can easily find the number. She got tired of running after you so that is why she is calling you now. Hey brother, I hope you are not scared. Why should I feel scared? You are scared that you might fall in love with her. Look at brother.. he is blushing. You all have gone mad. Then prove it, brother. When there is no matter then what do I prove? That you don't love her. Let's do one thing. Let's ask sister-in-law. Come on. Go away.. What is the matter? I.. You are restless. And your feet are not on the ground. Calm your mind and then come to me. What happened, brother? Did something unexpected happen? What unexpected happen? "The one whom I like." The one whom I love. The one whom I like. The one whom I love.. And he starts to stay away. What should this heart do? What should this heart do? What should this heart do? What should this heart do? The one whom I like. The one whom I love.. The one whom I like. The one whom I love.. And he starts to stay away. What should this heart do? What should this heart do? What should this heart do? What should this heart do? We have to leave with the goods. Hey catch him. Catch all of them. Don't let them go. Come on catch him. He should not be able to escape. Wait. Stop. - Let's go from here. Catch them. Come on, get inside. Do you have an idea how much loss we have suffered? We have blind faith on you. And you are not bothered. I think we will have to talk to brother Imran. You will not be able to manage so much business of gold. Enough of it. Why are you all shouting? Don't you know whom are you talking to? Has there been any problem in your work? Every time we have played with our lives. And your tone changed on just one mistake. Rascal. You will get your goods. Go away from here. - Look you.. What is this? He is shouting at you all and you are quietly listening. Who were they? Police or customs. This work is not of the customs but that of police. None of our men are informer of police. What if anyone is not involved with police. But is surely involved with police officer's daughter. He either meets commissioner or with his daughter. Taking this point into consideration we can again kidnap the girl. But Raju wouldn't like this. Brother Kareem I want to talk to Raju. Brother, that girl is on the line. Switch off the phone. I don't want to talk to her. Don't take to heart whatever they said. Forget it brother. I am not bothered about those people. Chandu's silence is troubling me. I am worried about that. Raju and Chandu got a chance they were waiting for. They got an invitation of international Mafia's brother Imran. I will take the heroine you ask me to take. Forgive me. I made a mistake brother. People who don't make a mistake do not cry so much. I am not crying, brother. But I am laughing. I am laughing. Whoever you tell will be the heroine. You were right. The one who has not made such a big mistake does not laugh so much. Brother, I am neither able to cry nor laugh. What is the timing of the party? Brother, should I think that you have forgiven me. Brother, if my movie is stopped then I will be finished. He is really troubling me. - Please help me. Brother.. Brother Imran. Brother, he is Chandu and he is Raju. Chandu, Raju.. You seem to be very young but do big jobs. You are flying very high. You are becoming too daring. Stay where you have reached otherwise you will die a dog's death. Hi. Forget him. What was that rascal saying? He will give us a dog's death. He will kill me like a dog. I will shoot him in his head. - Forget it. Why are you thinking so much about him? Nonsense. He was talking nonsense. What status does he have? Go and sleep. He doesn't know me. What does he think about himself? Chandu. - He will give us a dog's death. What has happened to you? He just said it once but you have said it hundred times. What did he say? He just said it. He does not have the courage to do it. Chandu. Go and sleep. Hey, you did not sleep the whole night. What did he say? Hey, you are still thinking about that. Have you gone mad? He invited us to the party to insult us. He will give us a dog's death. If you say then shall I kidnap him and bring him here. Is he commissioner's daughter or JK whom we shall just kidnap? You don't know him. He is a great personality. He lives in a big castle. Hey. - Yes. You kidnapped him. Do you think it is easy? He is such a great personality. He lives in such a big castle. How can I.. no.. You have kidnapped him. Isn't it? I know you have kidnapped him. Where is he? It is written on your face that you have done something. Have you kidnapped him? Tell me, tell me.. How could I leave him? - So you have kidnapped him. Yes. How did you kidnap him? Brother Raju, I did not let him sleep the whole night. The head of underworlds is standing in underground parking in under van. You did a great job. Why? You were scaring us. You will give us a dog's death. This is what you said. You thought that the entire sea belongs to your father. Who are you? No one can stop the person who has daring. Many like you come and go. People like you cannot stop our progress. We are like eagles and are made to fly high. Chandu, tell me shall we threaten him the way he did. You are flying very high. You are becoming too daring. Stay where you have reached otherwise you will die a dog's death. If I can kidnap you. Then I can kill you also. This time I am sparing you. Come on. Uncle, let him go. Okay brother Raju, okay. Hey, how did you kidnap him? You were complaining non-stop. I did not feel like coming alone from the party. That is why I went to the party again. Thank you, sir. It was really enjoyable. You did a great job. Where are you taking me? Just wait and watch. Hey. What is this? New car! What a style? Today I am very happy. I have bought it for you. For me. Just sit and see. What a steering buddy? What is she doing inside? Who got her here? What happened? Do you think only you can give a surprise? Since last one week I am watching you. Everything can be understood from your face. Neither you call her nor do you receive her calls. Why are you troubling her? Answer me. Why are you avoiding her? Why are you avoiding her? Who told you? Hey, Raju..Chandu very well knows who Raju is? And Raju knows who Chandu is Now do I have to open my heart and show you? Shall I show you? Why are you making me feel ashamed? We will not leave each other till the last breath. First answer my question. Chandu, the thing is that.. Hey, first answer my question otherwise I will get angry. I will not talk to you. Okay, brother sorry. Tell me what should I do? Now I should not see you for a week. Switch off your phone and go and enjoy. Understood. Go and enjoy your holidays. Go, go. Chandu, listen. Say whatever you want to after you come back. Go. Hello. I had never thought that we both would.. You disconnect my phone and do not reply to my messages. Come on, you should get beatings sometimes. May I.. - Dare not come inside and sit. I don't want to talk to you. Hey. If I get hurt then you will be in trouble. Hey, nice car. Look, the top opens. Wow! It would be fun going in this for long drive. Hey, shut up. Don't change the topic. I left everything and running after you like fools. And you are avoiding me. So what if I did not call. Our heart to heart connection is always there. Phone lines can get disconnected anytime. But look there is so much love in my eyes. Your eyes are also cheater like you. Wait. One minute, the phone is ringing. One minute. This is a call from your father's office. Pick up the phone and put it on speaker. Tell them that I am with you. - Okay. Hello. - I am speaking from commissioner's office. His daughter has been kidnapped again. If you come to know anything about her then please inform us. Actually we have arrested many people. This is just for your information. Not anybody else but I have kidnapped her. She is with me and loves me. I also love her. Understood. This is just for your information. Where is Jackie? His mother is unwell so that is why he hasn't come. Then do one thing. Send him some money. It will be of use to him. Okay. I will receive it. Yes Jackie, how is your mother now? Don't worry. Take mother to the hospital and I will arrange for money. Okay, keep the phone. It was Jackie's call. Chandu, there is a lot of traffic here. Let's go from some other route. Let's wait for some time. Manoj is right. The traffic is very badly jammed. We will get late. We will go to Marriot and will call JK there. We will call and ask him to come there. Okay tell him. Inform JK. Chandu, you sit in the car. We will go up and check the room. I shall call you and then you come. Come on, Amar. Hello. - Yes Chandu, come up. Okay. Why hasn't JK come till now? He must be on his way. Whose phone is it? It is JK's call. Why is he calling again and again. He knows very well that we are waiting. Tell him to come. JK, where are you? Come soon. Quickly. We are waiting. He is coming. There is something wrong here. We will do this meeting once Raju is back. Let's go. Chandu. Here he comes. Open. Hey! Your enmity is with me. Whatever revenge you want you can take from me but leave my men. Where is that boy, your friend? What is his name? Raju? Where is he? Call him. Call him immediately. If he doesn't come then no one will escape from here. Call him. Is everything fine? You all are fine. What did you think that you will be able to kill us? Raju, who are these people? Who are these people? You don't worry. It is Raju's call. Pick it up. Yes Raju. Chandu. Where is Chandu? If he has to save you.. Is everything fine? ..then he will have to come here. Where is Chandu? - Yes, he is in front of me. Give the phone to Chandu. Give him the phone. - He is in a meeting. Meeting. I will ask him to call you in some time. Where are you Raju? Hello. You. You have seen cheating of cheaters. Now see the faithfulness of faithful people. He will come and will not spare you. He will kill each one of you. And in the last will kill you. Once you are dead he will also be killed. He wanted to kill me. Rascal. Who was he? Who killed him? I shouldn't have left him alone. I made a mistake, brother Kareem. It is entirely my fault. Raju. - It is my fault. Raju. How did all this happen? Who did this? Who did this? How did this happen? Answer me. What condition has he done of Chandu? No one has the power to make his condition like this? Who did this? Who was he? Hey, did Imran do this? Tell me if Imran has done this. Where will I find Imran now? I will not spare him. I will kill him. Brother Kareem, has Imran done this? No one knows where he is but I will find him. Listen, Raju. - I don't want to listen to anything. I am asking you to come and sit in the car. Listen to me. Come on. Raju, listen.. I will not spare him. I will kill him. Everything is over. Everything is over. What were you doing when he ws killing him? Were you on looker? Calm down, brother. I will kill him right now. Come into your senses, Raju. Calm down. This is not the right time to kill him. I will not spare him. I will not spare him. I will kill him. What are you doing Raju? Have you gone mad? Where will we find him? - What are you doing? He killed Chandu? - We will surely kill him. He killed my brother. Calm down for now. - Where will I find him? Where will I find him? Have you gone mad? I should not have gone leaving him alone. Enough. It is entirely my fault. I should not have gone leaving him alone. Your condition would have been the same if you were there. What did you say? What do you think? You would have saved him. Brother Imran, Raju is dead. The main problem of our way is dead. After 11 months. Chennai express will leave in some time. Hurry up sir otherwise you will miss the train. I will not miss it. I will run and catch it. Train bound for Kolkatta will arrive on platform 8 Sorry for the inconvenience. What is it? Even Sheela and Munni like your beauty. If I get a chance.. ..then by doing an item song in Bollywood I would leave them behind. You are the male version of Aishwarya Rai. People do not have value for your beauty. Hey, you broke the mirror of my car. Stop the car. Rascal, stop the car. Your car will be damaged. Are you mad? It has just been two months I bought the car and you banged it. I did not bang. Rascal, now in whose mirror shall I see my beautiful face? Will you take me? Side mirror is broken and if you still wish to come then you can. What happened, brother? Why are you in so much tension in the morning? Some stupid fellow damaged my image in the morning. Did you see your own face in the morning? Have you come to trouble me more? No, I was just saying that. Tell me where do you want to go? I want to go to Parla. - Come, I will drop you. Give me the luggage. Even this idiot is damaged from one side like my car. Someone seems to have banged him also. Get inside. Where are you from, brother? I think you are from Kolhapur. Hey, how did you come to know? I came to know from your style. From style I am totally Kolhapuri. From how long are you in Mumbai? For last 15 years I am here. Where are you from? - Are you married? Yes, 5 years ago. Wife is in village. How many children do you have? - And yours. I have two children. Why have you become sad? Every time I ask the question and the passenger gives the answer. But today everything is happening the other way since morning. Before dropping him I will surely ask him one question. Look. - One minute. Even I have to ask you a question. Okay, ask. - You will not speak in between. Okay, I will not speak. Tell me, for what have you come here? Just drop me there. Stop the car on the left. - You.. what kind of a passenger is he? He seems to be playing KBC with me. Come on, get down. I think today is a bad day for me. On the way I had to listen to his nonsense. I don't know what is filled in his bag. Thanks. Sir, money. Wait here. I will change and come. Hey, give him a cup of tea. I am in a very bad mood. I know that is why I have called tea for you. Hello sir. - Hi. I am Krishna from Chennai. This is my Id card. - Thank you. Hello brother, shall we go? What is the matter? Why are you sitting quiet? Hey, what happened? Why aren't you speaking anything? I will speak only if you let me speak. You ask me questions just like police. If I would have answered so many questions in KBC.. ..then today I would have been a millionaire. Did you tell anything about yourself? So you want to know about me. Ask whatever you want to ask. Thank you, brother. Hey, this is the place. I want to go here also. The place is left behind. - Take a U turn. Now I feel like jumping from the taxi. He looks so innocent from face. I think he has got bored from drinking Indian. That is why he has come to Mumbai to drink imported. He cannot walk properly without drinking. And after drinking I am sure he will start dancing. Sir, a boy has come to meet brother Amar. Amar. - He is sitting there. What is it? Who have you come to meet? I am Krishna from Chennai. I am Raju's brother. And have to find about him. Someone told me that Amar is his good friend. Can I meet him? Raju. Who is he? If I meet Amar then I will.. I don't know anyone by the name Raju. Excuse me, where is Amar? I told you that I don't him, go away. Hey, brother, are you okay? Hey, come here. Come. What were you asking those people over there? Raju. Raju. Don't call him Raju but call him brother Raju. Brother Raju. How will those cowards know about a brave person? Nothing. Brother Raju was Mumbai's king. King. Who are you? I am Krishna, Raju's brother. Brother.Krishna. Sit, sit down. Sit down. Brother Raju's brother. Drink, drink. have a drink. Take this. Drink. No, no. Cheers. - No, no I don't take drinks. You don't drink. Very good. Brother Raju. Do you know what was brother Raju? People got scared of his name. The entire Mumbai used to get scared by brother Raju's name. Cheers. Brother Raju was my friend. He was the king. When brother Raju will come then he will kill everyone. He will kill everyone. Sir. Brother Raju. Hey. I am sure he is drunk. - Hey! Oh no! Hey rascal, what did you do? I am sorry. Can't you see? I have just taken a new car. Go away from here. - I am going. What happened? You were ditching me and running away. Why shouldn't I go? I heard your story and have come to know your flashback. Couldn't you tell me earlier that you are brother of Raju? Look here. Do you think I have put this sticker in my car just for fun? Look, there are holes in it. These holes have just not been made in my car. Your brother shot at it. The tyres of a car get punctured but your brother punctured the entire car. You ask questions to people and kill them. And kill them and your brother kills them with bullets. Do both of you find my car always? Hey, I have small children and an old mother. And I don't want my car to be damaged further. That is why, forgive me, and you go. Get a side. You are already crippled. Listen to me. Are you drunk early in the morning? Nothing has happened. Who will pay for the damage? Since morning I have not earned anything. I am saved at last that he has gone. Hey, when did you come and sit inside? I banged the front side of a rickshaw and you are sitting comfortably. Your brother was a violent killer and you are a silent killer. That means I have to tolerate both the brothers in Mumbai. Now tell me where you want to go. Kamattipura. Kamattipura..kamattipura. This is what happens when you don't get married at the right age. It is good that at least you are still young. Come on. Where is he? He was sitting here, brother. If he was sitting here then where did he go. Excuse me. Can I meet Mr. Manoj here? What's your good name, sir? I am Krishna, Raju's brother. Hey the queen Come on play. Hi. I have come to meet Mr. JK. Hey, who are you? He is Raju's brother and has come to meet Mr. JK. Hey, tell me why have you come here? Tell me why have you come here? - Sir. Tell me what work you have here. Tell me otherwise I will kill you. - I have just.. You seem, to be very daring. Get a side. Get a side. If you were a true man. Then you would have dared to touch his brother that day. Why are you threatening him unnecessarily? Your brother had really hit him. That is why he is taking out the anger on you. Why did you want to meet me? Actually I am finding my brother, Raju. Someone said that you must be having any idea about him. Raju. He was very true to his words and perfect in his work. In my entire life I have not seen a person like him. I did a lot of business with them and learnt many things from them. One day I had a meeting with Chandu but Amar cancelled it. After that I never met both of them. Hail to God. Kareem was a very important person of that gang. If you meet him then you might be able to know something about your brother. Brother Kareem someone has come to meet you. He is waiting for you outside. Tell me. I am Krishna. Raju's brother. I have come here to find my brother. Where will I find him? Come with me. Raju and Chandu were more than real brothers. They were an example of friendship. Both had the passion of ruling underworld. Everyone used to feel scared by the name of Raju and Chandu. One day they met a great king of underworld. Brother Imraan. From that day their bad time started. They are very dangerous. You do not stay here. They must not know that you are here. Hide behind. Who refused to give the car? He is the one. You are so small and yet so much daring. Amar, what did that child do? Why are you hitting him? What is it Kareem? Why did you refuse to give the car? You use the car for wrong doings that is why we did not give. Don't trouble me. Is that so? After doing so many wrong things now you are saying this. You don't want your travel agency business to do well. Send the car from tomorrow. Come on everyone. Brother, the boy who was asking about you in the bar is standing here. Hey, stop the car. Take it back. Take it back. There he is. Hey, bring him here. What has he done? Why are you calling him? He has just come from Chennai. He has got nothing to do with this. He is handicapped. Why are you taking his side? Hey, bring him here. I have heard that he was asking about me. Come on. Come on rascal. Who is he? I have come to know that he is finding his brother. Look, let him go. He has not done anything. Please. Get a side Kareem. Get a side. - Listen to me. Where have you come from? What do you want to know about your brother? What is there in the bag? Give me the bag. There is nothing in this. Please. - Give me the bag. Look, what is there inside this. Didn't you tell him that his brother is dead? Till now insects must have eaten him up in water. I have killed your brother. I have. Understood. Shall I kill you also? Amar, no. - I killed your brother with this gun. Understood. Make him understand, Kareem. Make him understand that people once dead cannot get alive. That is why it is better to go. If I get angry then I shall kill you here. Look, he is getting so angry. Do one thing. Let his search for his brother end here. Send him also there. Kill him. No Amar, let him go. Get away. Anybody help him. He has not done anything. Leave him. Kill him. Leave him. No. Ask him not to kill him. "Leave him." "He is the man." "He is the man." "He is the man." "He is the man." "Brother Raju, brother Raju." "Brother Raju, brother Raju." Hey, lock the door. No one should escape. You thought that you would kill me by shooting two bullets at me. No. I am Raju and I will decide about my death. I will decide about your death also. Traitor. Traitor. Raju, if they come to know that you have come then they will die of fear. Those who came to know about my truth are no more. Till I do not come to know who the real traitor.. ..till that time I am not Raju but Krishna. Keep it as a secret. "He is a man power." "He is a man power." "He is a man power." "Brother Raju." "Brother Raju." Raju, you take rest for some time. I have not come here to take rest, brother Kareem. Whenever I close my eyes I see the Chandu's face covered with blood. I just want to take revenge. Even I have not been able to forget him, Raju. I can understand that.. ..now you have come so we can come to know about the truth. Tell me what happened the other day. There was an important meeting that day. At the last moment the plan changed and told me that I need not come along. So they did not take me. After Chandu and you went the entire gang scattered. Only one person did not come in Chandu's last rites and that was Jackie. If we find him then we can come to know that what happened the other day. Brother Kareem, I know where we can find him. In the horse race. Yes, yes come on. Yes. Brother Raju. Wow! You have started running faster than the horses. Where were you running, traitor. Why can't you speak? Why are you hiding then? Will you tell me everything.. ..or shall I make you open your mouth? Are you speaking or.. - No, brother Raju. No, brother Raju. It is not necessary that the one who hides is the culprit. I have not done anything. I am just scared of death. He is also running to save his life, brother Raju. I swear brother Raju, I have not done anything. That day Johnny asked me not to come. He said that there was no need of me to come today. I asked him the reason.. ..and he replied that there was no need to ask so many questions. Do as I say. And told me that I will get my share. That time I understood that there was something wrong. I had called you brother but you did not pick up the phone. Then I called up Chandu. But instead of Chandu Johnny picked up the phone. He started talking about matters as if my mother was sick. I do not know what they did with brother Chandu. I had run away from there. I am saying the truth, brother. I swear upon my mother. Where is Johnny? After that day I have never seen him, brother. I know the weakness of that rascal also. My eyes are on the way.. My heart is restless.. My eyes are on the way.. My life is restless. There is no music. Come, my dear. And dance with me. And dance with me. Sir, sit here. Sit down. Hey, Reshma a customer has come. My heart is restless.. My eyes are on the way.. My life is restless. There is no music. Come, my dear. Is Bijli there? Bijli where will you find her. Look, there is Rekha, Rani, Sheela, Jawani. I just want Bijli. I will give you any amount. Bijli, my darling Bijli. A handsome hot man has come outside and is just asking about you. Come. Along with fun you will get money also. Tell him to come tomorrow. Today I have given time to Johnny. My lover is waiting for me. I wish he had asked for me. Hey handsome, even if you pay more Bijli will not be yours. She is going out for a meeting with someone else. You come tomorrow. She will surely be yours. Tell her that I will come tomorrow. I am telling you that she was a sexy girl. Taxi. He is a fool. Hey are you Ram's brother Shyam? Are you still in Mumbai? You will not be able to find your brother here. So many people get lost after coming here. Now where do you want to go? - Malad. Do you want to go to Malad or Madh island? Come on, I will drop you. Your brother was a nice man so there was no chance of him coming here. Brother Raju might beat people but he was a nice man at heart. I had a doubt when you were asking about your brother. Where is my brother? Where is my brother? Where will you find him in entire city? Stop the car, here. How much? Hey, your money is still saved. I thought you would have spent everything there. Did you do anything or just showed your face and came back. Did you say anything? No, I was just saying that it is raining heavily. Take this. You have already insulted yourself.. ..so now there is no need to bow your head. Thanks. Okay. You had said that you had booked a special ticket for me. I was a fool that I believed you. What should I do if an important work came up? I don't know where you went to fight. - We have reached. Come on. The show must have started. Is this the place? Come on, come on. What is the fun of going now? Come on otherwise the show will get over. Show is already over. We are there. Come on. We will get it started from beginning. People will call us fools. - Come on. Everything is fine. Greetings brother Raju. Chandu, how come you both are here? We would have come if you had asked us. What is the matter? Is there any problem? Tell us. No, no we just want to make a small request. This program needs to be done again. There is no tension of expenditure. Why will we take money from you brother, Chandu? Please come. - Yes, please come. You too come, madam. Sir, you did an amazing work today. Your classical tunes did a magic on everyone. You are great. You sing so well. It seems as if Goddess Saradswati sits in your throat. You just sing like Tansen. Come, come. Sir, I have a request for you. You keep sitting. They are our special guests. They have great respect in Mumbai. They have come to hear your song, sir. Sir, they are Mumbai's don. He is right. Oh God, don. Don of this place. - Yes sir. If they are, don of this place then I am don of music. I am, don of music. Will he sing today? What do you think music is? Do you think it is a sweetmeat that.. ..whenever you want you can distribute it? And then eat it. No. Music is an art. It is an art that gives satisfaction to soul. Do you know how did it rain in Mumbai today? When I sang the tune of Amrit Varsha Raag. I raised it higher and higher and touched the God of rain in heaven.. ..and then it started raining. The entire Mumbai is floating. Obama from America said once more but I did not entertain. Then who are you? Useless people. He is shouting unnecessarily. Request him, please. Take them from here. Now I am not in a good mood. Go from here. - Come on. Request him. - I will talk to him. Chandu. Sir, we will give you four times the money you take. Oh, you are showing me money. You want to give bribe and buy music. What do you think I am? Take them from here. I am not in a mood. Throw them out. I am not in a mood. - Come on, Chandu. Raju wait, I will talk to him. Wait. Go away. We are requesting you. - What? And not threatening you. They both love each other.. ..and had bought the tickets in the front row to watch your show. Because of me they got late. We got stuck in a meeting. Just for love, sir otherwise they will break up. Please sing for them. Are they in love? With each other. Is it? Yes. Yes. Okay, okay. You know brother. Bhairavi.. What do you know about Bhairavi? This is not just a tune but my soul. I loved Bhairavi and wanted to marry her. But Bhairavi died and now she only guides me. If you are giving four times the money then why shouldn't I sing? For their love I will sing again. Hey, he agreed. - Just wait and watch. Come on, come on start the music. Happy. Very nice. Has he got any fit? I cannot tolerate this. What are you doing? I will not be able to hear this. You tolerate it. I am waiting outside. - leave me. Oh my God. He made us crazy. Why have you come out? - Wasn't it nice? Brilliant. We came out to see if it is raining because of concert. Stop fooling me. To hell with him. His singing was hopeless. He was singing Bhairav tune. I think he must have killed his girl friend.. ..by making her listen to this tune. You should start dancing the moment the music plays. I am going to dance. Wait. "1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13." "1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13." "I wait for you by counting days." "Come on dear it is time for love." "Your eyes are black with kohl." "Your eyes are black with kohl." "Your eyes are black with kohl." "Your eyes are black with kohl." "What is behind the blouse?" "What is under the veil?" "My heart is there in blouse." "My heart is there in the veil." "My heart is there in blouse." "My heart is there in the veil." "I will give this heart to my beloved." "To my love." "Twisting my moustaches." "And putting on goggles like brother." "By adding buttermilk in coconut." "Come in mood everyone." "All the Rajni fans..Thaliva." "Don't miss the chance.. Thaliva." "All the Rajni fans..Thaliva." "Don't miss the chance.. Thaliva." "Let's do Lungi dance, lungi dance." "Let's do Lungi dance, lungi dance." "Let's do Lungi dance, lungi dance." Enjoy.. You always keep sticking to him. What have I done? What have you not done? Having a girlfriend he still praises his boyfriend. Chandu is like this, Chandu is like that. Okay, so this is your problem. Come on, today I will talk to him and solve this problem. Just wait. Raju. come here. Come here. I want to talk to you. Sit. In the middle of the road. What do you want to talk in the middle of the road? What is the problem? Hey, do you really love her? Yes, buddy. There is some friend of yours Chandu.. ..and she says that you keep on talking about him. Who is this Chandu? So sister-in-law is complaining. Hey back biter. Listen. You want to know who Chandu is. Look here. Raju leave me. - Look here. Leave me, buddy. Many times there were attempts to kill me but he always came in between. He has saved my life five times. Chandu is not just my friend. But more than my brother. Have I only saved your life? Today no one dares to mess with me. Do you know why? Today the entire Mumbai is scared of me. Do you know why? Just because you are with me. Those seven years you spent in jail just for me. Hey, keep quiet. Why, can't I speak anything? Only you can talk about me. Wherever I am is because of you. Whatever I say you get it in two minutes. Who does all this? Tell me, who does all this. Hello, hello, wait a minute, brothers. What is going on? You promised me that you will solve my problem. And you both are praising each other. Am I an audience? If you want to talk about yourself then why am I needed? Dostana part II will really be made with you two. Shameless. I am going. Hey, hey stop her. - Hey wait. Listen, Gia. It never happens like this. We just said what we were thinking. We have never talked to each other like this. Sorry. Shall I say something truly? I have no complaints against you. Such friendship is very difficult to get, Raju. Shall I say something from heart? You will always remain happy like this. She fall in love. Sister, your phone is ringing. You are the one who was finding me yesterday. What did you see in me? I have heard that you are ready to give any amount. Do you love me so much? My lover. I am fluttering more today than you were fluttering yesterday. I am totally trapped in your awe. Today is my birthday. And an old lover Johnny is coming to give me a gift. Just one hour. I will be back soon after meeting him. Okay. - Write down my number 99380229767. Okay. Just one hour and then I will be in your arms. Hello baby. Hello darling. Where are you?

Raju that.. I know something wrong happened that day. Just tell me what happened. Tell me. Raju. Tell me. - I will tell you, wait I will tell you. That day we had a meeting with JK. I, Amar, Chandu and Manoj went there. Kill you. He will come and not spare you. He will kill each one of you. And at the end you also. The moment you die he will be the next one to die. You wanted to kill me, idiot, and rascal. Raju. I made a mistake. Raju, don't kill me. Please. I am sorry Raju. No, Raju no. No, Raju no. Let brother Manoj come. We will talk and solve it later. Okay, is that fine? It is fine. Come on go down and see who it is. Who shot at us? Hey, catch hold of that car. He is there. Follow him. Hurry up. Take the car out. Tell me when Manoj is coming. Otherwise I will kill you. Next Friday. No problem. Who was he? Who can dare to come here and shoot at us? Who is he? Tell me who is he? Till now two incidents have taken place. Nothing is known about Amar. Johnny is also dead. And now this shootout. Surely there is someone who is targeting me. Find out who he is. I will have to find out. Find out who he is. Sir. - Hey. Lastly a person by name Krishna came.. ..and was saying that he is Raju's brother. Raju's brother. Hey, turn on the CCTV. Hey wait. Pause. Zoom. He is the one. I want him soon. Wherever he is in Mumbai I want him. I have sent you a photo and we want him. Don't take tension. Work will be done. Turn it off now. Sir.. ..this is not recorded but live. Live. A person is coming up now. Send him to me. I have heard that you came here in search of me. Why? Yes, I had come in search of my brother. I think you are Raju's brother. - Yes. Did you all see? He is his brother. Wow. You resemble Raju but have a different hairstyle. I will open the buttons of the shirt and do the collar up. Wow! Raju style. These spectacles are not suiting you. There is no need for this. And this bag. It seems as if you are going to school. No, no. No bag Wow! Raju. One more thing that is quite different between you and your brother. Your brother used to press a tooth pick in his teeth with style. And you in feet. No problem. Be careful. Are you okay? Other than all this there was something else in your brother.. ..which is not there in you. There was a nice big cut on his eyebrow. There is just a cut that is missing in you. Here, on this side. Hello, greetings brother Imran. Brother, you have given me this new life. Nothing brother. A boy has come and says that he is Raju's brother. But there is no tension. Brother arrangements of your birthday are happening in hotel Hyatt. Okay brother, okay. Don't waste your time in finding your brother here. Go from here. Your brother is not here. Go, your brother is not here. He is dead. My brother is not dead. What did you say? He is alive. Is your brother alive? Where is he? He is here. Is he here in Mumbai? Where is he? He is present here. What? He is here. Now I have understood. First Amar then Johnny and then this shoot out. So he has done everything. What are you doing standing here? Go and find him. You are so daring that you will enter my office and kill me. Tell me where your brother is? Brother Raju. Shoot. Shoot. "Brother Raju." "Brother Raju." "Brother Raju." "Brother Raju." No..Brother Raju, brother Raju. How can the person recognize others whose face is covered with lies? No.. Brother Raju. No one can become Chandy just by tossing the coin. Listen to me. Don't kill me. Raju, please listen to what I want to say. Please, listen to me. Raju, earlier I had nothing but now I have everything. Look at everything. All this is mine Raju. I have bungalows, cars and even do gold business. Look Raju, I have progressed a lot. I have become a big man. A big man. Look Raju don't worry at all. I will talk to brother Imran. He will forgive you. Raju, he is a very nice man. I will apologize on your behalf. Raju, whatever Chandu had now belongs to me. I have everything today with me except one thing. What is that? That is you Raju. Only you are not with me Raju. Just be with me Raju and entire Mumbai will be ours. Come on shake hands with me Raju. What are you thinking Raju, shake hands with me Raju. Shake hands with me. You cheated Chandu and now you want me to be a traitor too. You have reached this position by standing on Chandu's dead body. Such a position is not sufficient for you. You have to go much higher and higher. You still have to go higher. Traitor.. all are traitors. Hey. You must be thinking that the aim was right even then I am alive. This is live telecast baby. Live telecast. You are just standing at one place but I am at ten different places. Because the party is going on at 10 different places, darling. Holography 3D projection. You have made a lot of efforts to reach me. I know that you have killed the three of them. Only you can give them such worst death. My estimation was right, brother Raju. This time when I come to Mumbai will surely meet you. Find out this rascal wherever he is in Mumbai. That also alive. Find him. Catch him. Hey, where is he? Where is Raju? Who are you all? He is not here. Where is Raju? Leave him. What are you doing? Where is Raju? Tell us where is he? Leave her. Leave me. Kareem, some hooligans came and beat us very badly. They destroyed everything and those rascals took Panchi also with them. What? - Save Panchi, Kareem. Brother Kareem nothing will happen to Saira. I promise you. I will not leave them alive who have kidnapped her. They have not kidnapped Saira.. ..but she is your Gia. She was Gia. My Raju cannot die. He cannot leave us like this and go. He will surely come back. I have full faith. Even you know how deep friendship was there between Chandu and Raju. He still has to avenge Chandu's death. I don't want him to forget his aim, brother Kareem. Can I stay for some days in your house? Call him. Call him. Show me your hand. Show. Brother Raju. She is brother Raju's lover. She is brother Raju's lover. Now call him. Otherwise I will burn this tattoo. Don't laugh. You do not know whom have you kidnapped. Now it is your turn. He has come. Save yourself if you can, Baldy. Brother Kareem is waiting outside. Go and sit in the car. Go. Go. I am asking you to go. Hey! What do you think we people are standing here unnecessarily? Will we let you go like this? Without giving you a treat. Let me see how you go. Go. Go. Brother, we have caught Raju. Bring him to me immediately. Okay, brother I will bring him to you immediately. Hey. Do you know why have you come back alive? On whose request? It was my whole hearted wish.. ..to kill you. You don't have to die with a small bullet, Raju. I shall make you swim in blood. You messed up with brother Imran. You should feel sorry for that. Do you know with what did I kill your friend? With this. Death is pondering on your head and you are laughing. My death or yours. If you can change your plan.. ..then I am your master. "Brother Raju." You have kidnapped me on brother Imraan's order. If I run away.. ..then will brother Imraan leave you alive? Keep quiet. Have you gone mad? You are sitting here with four people pointing gun at you.. ..and you think you will run away easily. I have not come to die at your hands after having facing death once. I am a kidnapping specialist. Then who are you to kidnap me. Not you but I have kidnapped you. You used to be a kidnapper earlier. Don't pay attention to what he says. He is a very clever person. Don't you believe me? Ask the driver to take right. What did you say? Ask the driver to turn the car to right. Hey, take to the right. Ask him to take left. Left, right, front, back everywhere there are my cars. I have kidnapped you. You all are in my custody. Let's talk about business. For how many years are you working with Imraan? What has he done for you all? But if for now you keep your gun away from me. Just a little away. Then in just 10 minutes of acquaintance I can take your life 10 years ahead. Who are you all? You work for Imraan. You smuggle gold of Arabs and give it to Imraan. He joins hands with police and sells gold here. You have manpower that is why he has kept you all with him. I know your capability. But you do not know yourself. I just want Imraan. At any cost. I will surely reach to him. This Mumbai will be without Imraan.. ..but will belong to you four. You can get goods worth 100 crores. Think over it. Just think over it. What are you thinking? Just kill him. Only a diamond can cut diamond. Only fire can extinguish fire. Only traitor can kill a traitor. I have learnt all this from you. I will not kill you with a small bullet. But kill you by making you swim in blood. You killed Chandu with this. You have seen cheating of cheaters. Now watch the faithfulness of faithful people. He will come and will not spare you. And kill each one of you. And in the end you also. Brother Raju. Raju you go. We will put his dead body in a proper place. You don't worry. We will manage everything. You go. Yes brother Raju you go. What are you looking at? Pick him up. Pick him. If they cannot be faithful to their master. Then how can they be faithful to me? "He is the man." "He is the man." Hey, where are you going? Hey, rickshaw where are you going? Yesterday I got a new glass fitted and today you broke it. I think it is not in my destiny to see my beautiful face in the mirror. Brother, Kanyakumari express will come on which platform. Am I a TC? Hey, hero it is you. So, you are going back. You came here to find your brother and now you have found a wife. In Mumbai every second a person gets lost. Even you will not be able to find your brother. Understood. Okay close the chapter of your brother. And go and settle your life. Okay. My blessings will always be with you. Go and take a left from ahead. - Come. One minute, brother. Listen, brother. When did your leg get cured? Brother Raju. I did not know that I was talking to a powerful man.
