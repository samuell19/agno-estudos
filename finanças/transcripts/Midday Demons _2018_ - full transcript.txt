And I'm gonna record them, if that's okay. So this is very well done on the exhibition, I'm really impressed with the work. Thank you so much. Right, and I thought we'd start with this piece here in particular, and I get a sense, you know, your portraiture's very clear, but yet you kind of leave out a lot of the detail, maybe you could talk about that. I don't want the essence of the person to be trapped with their appearance, and this is my husband, so I don't want his essence trapped. Oh! Hiya! Hey, how did it go? Well, everybody wanted your portrait. Seems the people really like you. I'm sorry I didn't come, I have to finish this before tonight. I really don't want to do this trip. Listen, I've been thinking. I'll come with you. Come on, it's been ages since we've been away together, and I've never even seen your country. Yeah. Are you sure? It's gonna be really boring, relatives, notaries. Oh, you'll see. It's not gonna be boring with me. Leo! Oh, there's Michele. Leo! Nice. Come, come with me. And the house. What are you going to do? I'm selling it to my brother, he says he wants it. You sure? Did you live here? My family. I left this place when I was a child. Megan, let's... Megan, this is my brother, Nicola. Nicola: Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. You already started with the work here? Have you heard the news? No, what? Uncle Domenico, maybe they make him a saint. They send someone here to check on the process. Look at this! Oh! Oh my God. Is this the saint? Yeah. We lived with him when our parents died. Why don't we stay here? You're joking. Why? Why? It's a mess here. There isn't even a phone. I will clean it up, and we don't need a phone. Aren't we on holidays? I know, but we booked a hotel. But it doesn't make any sense to rent a room when we have a house like this. Ah, here they are. So... We were thinking of staying here instead of the hotel. Here? Yeah. You can't stay here. It's filthy and dusty, and not to mention, falling apart. Wow. It's wonderful. Ah, look at this. What's this for? Oh! So many surprises. You've barely even mentioned him, and now I find he's gonna be a saint? Look at this stuff. Amazing. Was your brother mad at us? It looked like it. But who cares? What do you think? You don't get along with him, do you? He always wants to be the boss. He even started the restoration works, and the house is still mine. What did your Uncle Domenico do to become a saint? He healed people. Did he? So they say. I know that people in need came to see him. I really don't remember anything. You know, they say that forgetting is like not having lived. - Cheers. - Cheers. Megan, you know there was no one like his uncle here, you should know. He did so much for everybody here. He married us. Ah! And look at what a beautiful wife you got. It's a miracle of your uncle's. It's not a joking matter. Anyway, Leo, what do you think about our town now that you're back? Everything is the same, even you guys, fortunately. You also are the same. We never get too old. Give me a light. You smoke? Yes, but just once in a while. Yeah, but with the baby, aren't you worried that it's bad for him? Do you have children? No. - So, what? - Well, it's... Nicola and his bloody bells! Oh, I just had the worst dream. I was trapped in the dark, and I hear water. I haven't slept like this for ages. Really? Yeah. Ready for the beach? Uh, no. You go. You and your friends have so much to catch up on. What's wrong with my friends? Nothing from my side. Well, it wasn't very nice what you said to Pia last night. Smoking while pregnant is pure ignorance. Think of all the people that can't have kids. Come on! We agreed this is over. Anyway, the sun here is too strong for me. You're gonna stay here alone? I'll wait for this cleaning lady and show her the house. Did I scare you? Yeah. The door was open, and I've come to tell you the maid can't come today. She's sick. Okay. I'm sorry, Annarita, I don't have anything to offer you, but we can go to a bar and have something there if you want. Don't worry. What are you looking at? Some old photos. Do you recognize anyone? Oh, let me see. Um, this is Monsignor Domenico. And the girl is? I don't know. Something to eat. Oh, no. You must be Leo de Mundo's wife, right. Yes, I am. I'm pleased to meet you. My name is Albert von Galen. Megan. I come from Bressanone. I'm here on behalf of the commission sent to investigate the canonization of Monsignor Domenico de Mundo. So you're kind of a detective. I'm more the devil's advocate. I'm here to find the truth. Megan. Megan? Hey, where have you been? I got lost on the way back. The village is completely deserted. I know, it's the controda. The what? The controda. The name they use here for the hottest hours of the day when everybody stay inside. Is it like the siesta? It's different. Well, the shadows of the dead come at this time to find the living. Do you believe these stories? I sure do. Come on. It seems like a good way to keep the kids off the street and out of the heat. This is your family, isn't it? Yeah. Well, these two were my parents, and this is Uncle Domenico, the others may be my grandparents, I don't know who she is. And who was this? This, I don't know. Have you noticed how in old photos people are always serious? The idea of smiling in a picture is a modern thing. Or maybe they had the right idea, and now everyone pretends to be happy. I wonder why. You're not happy? Now I am. Oh, I like that song. What song? Didn't you hear the girl singing? Nope. Huh. At home, cleaning. Megan. Megan. It's me, it's okay. You're scaring me. There was a shadow. A shadow? And then... It was a dream. Yeah, but it felt really real. It felt like something was pressing on my stomach. You're letting those stories get to you. Or maybe the heat. Come on, you know I don't like it when you look at my work before it's finished. What's he doing? He's beating the octopus to make it more tender. Well, I feel sorry for it. Hey, look who it is. Megan, so funny we see you at the beach. Imbacuccata is... Take all the stuff off. No! - Hey, hey, hey. - Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Hey. Oh my God, you're so tense, my God. Leo, your woman's like a violin string. Oh, sorry, sorry. Did you know what happened to Pia? No, what? She lost the baby, a miscarriage. Oh, I'm sorry. Anyway, she's fine now, and already back home. Pia! You're still here. Why don't you go away? Pia, I'm so sorry. No, you're not sorry. No, I am sorry. She's going through a lot lately, I apologize. Oh, it's okay. Come, I'll show you around. As paintings, they are not masterpieces, but they are sincere, and they tell the true stories of those who face death. So, do all these stories have happy endings? Absolutely. God wanted to give them another chance. Miracles. Like Domenico's. Did you send a girl out to clean the courtyard the other day? A girl? She was singing? Maybe she's one of the worker's daughters. Yeah, maybe. I want to know what's happening. What do you come here for anyway? Don't rush me, I need to think about it. Megan, what happened? Megan, what happened? Come on, come in the light. Oh God, oh God, the crabs! Father Nicola. Ah, Father von Galen, of course. I've been expecting you. How is your research going? It's going well. I'm starting to know your uncle better every day. Great. Have you ever known someone by the name Pasquale Loia? Pasquale Loia. He's a painter. One of his paintings hangs in the sacristy. Ah, of course. You're talking about... It was one of my uncle's most famous miracles. It was in Bressanone when it happened. He saved a mother and her son from certain death. Good morning. How are you? Can you tell me what's going on? I've already told you. What? The shadows? You really believe in all that stuff? I'm not selling the house. Leo. Wait, wait, wait. I realize this place means something to me. No, no. Please. Please. Where did you find that? I found them in here. Do you know the people in them? Yes, of course. It's my family. That is my mother, that is my father. That is Uncle Domenico. My grandparents. And the girl is... She's Aunt Gisella. My father's sister. Is she still alive? No, everyone is dead. And who's this? I don't know. Maybe a neighbor. I also found an old calendar from 1976. There's lots of writing in it that stops on June the 16th. Did something happen then? My parents died. I'm so sorry. It's all right. It was a long time ago. I'm sorry, excuse me. Megan, are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. Shall I call Leo? No, really, I'm fine, I just need to lie down for a bit. I'm fine, thanks. I'm looking for Nicola. I've been looking at the ex photo paintings my entire life, and I've never seen one with a dead person. This is a strange ex photo, don't you think? And the painter died 14 years before the miracle ever happened. Can I show you something? Okay. I don't want to sound crazy, but I know something terrible happened in this house. What do you mean? It's like these drawings weren't done by me, but they've come from things I've seen. In dreams? Not only in dreams, when I'm awake too, they're like fragments. Mixed up pieces. Pieces of what? Of something that happened here. Have you seen this? Wasn't this where we came to hide when we were kids? I don't remember. Come on, you remember. Uncle Domenico used to say he would close us inside if he found us down here. What is all this interest back here all of a sudden? Does my being here bother you? No. But maybe you should be more aware of your surroundings. Perhaps your wife is pregnant. Are you okay? Yeah. You sure? Mhm. Could you stop a second? Are you pregnant? Why didn't you tell me? Leo, how many times did we try and the doctors said there was no possibility for us to have children? They were obviously wrong. Isn't this what you always wanted? I don't know. Something's wrong. No, it's gonna be fine. It's not gonna be fine! Don't you understand? They won't come. Of course they'll come. The women won't come. Why not? Because they're afraid of this place. Please, enough now, I'm tired of this. Why didn't you invite Nicola? He annoys me. You know, he keeps going on about the house. He's your brother. So? I'm going to change. Can you please keep an eye on the sauce? Fine. Ciao! Megan, do you have any brothers or sisters? Yeah, three sisters. I bet your father wanted a boy. He says he didn't. According to my father, men create problems and women solve them. Yes, but what do you prefer? Boy or girl? Either one is fine for me. Don't worry. I'll get it. Shut up, shut up. Shut up, shut up, shut up. Leo! Leo! Leo! Someone must've cleaned it up, it was here. You don't believe me, do you? You think I'm crazy. No, no, of course not. But who clean? Maybe you saw it because of the heat. Come on, come on, Megan. Please. Come on. Please, please, come on, Megan. - It's not fair! - Megan, no, no, Megan, no. Do you know what happened to Leo and Nicola's parents? They died together. Nobody knows exactly how. Leo's grandmother died shortly afterwards, they couldn't avoid it. She died from the pain of losing her son and daughter-in-law. But there are those who say that she committed suicide here, in the house. Megan. Megan, are you okay? Did she jump off the roof of this house? I don't know. Maybe, but now please, no more talk of death and dead people. A woman like you should enjoy life. Is she still alive? Everyone is dead. Nicola. Call an order and let's go sign. I'm leaving. Do you speak English? No. Documents? Please. Did you know your Aunt Gisella's still alive? What are you talking about? I couldn't find her death certificate, your brother's lying. Why don't you mind your own business? Her name isn't on the family tomb, so I checked in the town registry, she's not dead. Where did you go? To look for records. For what? I found out... Listen now. You have to stay out of my family business. Do you understand? Dead are dead, you should leave them alone. Ciao. This is Megan de Mundo. Good morning. How may I help you? I'm here to see Gisella de Mundo, my aunt. Or rather, my husband's aunt. I've just come all the way from Ireland. You must keep in mind that Gisella lives in her own world. She does not engage with others. She may not even register that you are speaking to her. Sister Olivia, bring madame to Gisella. And please, keep your visit down to a few minutes. She's Gisella. Gisella. Remember Leonardo? Waste of my time. Anni. Anni. You and your bastard! Can't you seen what you've done? This woman is always nice and calm. What did you say to her? Father, I need to see you. I'll be back tomorrow. Monsignor Domenico had a sister, Gisella de Mundo. She's still alive. I have met her, but she didn't even see me. Well, she spoke to me. Anni? Shh! Quiet! Let me go! Why did you do this? Now I have to fix everything! It's Uncle Domenico! No, we just have to explain this! Leo! Megan, Megan, where are you? Help! Leo, watch out! Ow! Megan, get out! He's not your brother, Leo! You're the son of Domenico and Anni. She was your mother. Help. Help me, please. Please, help me! Please, help me. No!
