On the plains of Serengeti in Africa, countless grass-eating animals live together. Every year they mate, and foals are born. Look at that mommy zebra with her newborn baby. She will teach her baby how to survive in the wild. CLOSED -Yet, it's not easy -Cho-won, - to survive in the wild. - we have to take another way. -Dangers are everywhere -We can't go this way. - around their babies. - I said, we can't go here. Be good, Cho-won. One more bite, and I will give you a surprise. One more bite! Cho-won, what's that? What's that? Rain. Say it after me. Rain. Repeat after Mommy. Rain. "It's pouring down." What is this? Rain. Repeat after me. Rain. "It's pouring down." "It's pouring down." Say rain. "It's pouring down." Say it. Why can't you say it? You're not mute. "It's pouring down." Still, Serengeti is one of the few wildlife havens left in the world. There, mommies can let their babies graze and run freely. A long time ago, that was the case in every part of the world. A big dog is chasing you. How would you feel, Cho-won? Happy? Sad? Angry? Or scared? Didn't I tell you? Your dad is traveling far away. How would you feel, Cho-won? Happy? Sad? Angry? Or scared? Your mom is sick, and she is in the hospital. How would that make you feel? Happy? Sad? Angry? Scared? Autism isn't a disease. It is a disability. It can't be cured with medicine or surgery. Their inability to express their feelings or to communicate, hinders their social lives. Having difficulty mingling with people becomes the biggest problem for them. It wears out their families too. - What's wrong? - Cho-won is missing. - What? - What should we do? Cho-won! Cho-won! Cho-won! Cho-won! Cho-won. Okay. We'll always be together. Until we die. Tree. It's called a tree. Sunshine. The sun shines brilliantly. Creek. It's cool, isn't it? Wind. That is wind. Wind. Your heart is racing. Your heart is going pitter-patter. So does mine and so does your brother's. Everyone is the same. You're no different... from others. Your legs are? Million dollar legs. - Your body is? - A killer. Your legs are what? Million dollar legs. "I can do it." Say it. "I can do it." - I can do it. - Louder. I can do it! Let's go. Let's go! - Let's go. - Let's go. HAN RIVER 10KM RACE Despite his disability, he performed with great results. Please give them a big hand. NEW BALANCE HAN RIVER RACE Here we go. Look at the camera. Please lower the trophy a bit. There you go. Now, give me a smile. Come on, show me a big smile. Keep smiling. - Good job. - Train every day. No playing hooky. That's right, my son. You're so smart. Animal Kingdom at six o'clock. Don't worry. We're not late. Animal Kingdom. All right. Hi, Jung-won. Already home? I told you. It's midterm week. You must be hungry. I'll fix you something. I already ate. Wash the towels, will you? Dad called. He can't make it next week either. About 30 seconds before the show. You don't bow to your little brother. No bowing to my little brother. On the plains of Serengeti in Africa, countless grass-eating animals live together. Zebras live in flocks. Antelopes and giraffes... - Sit up straight. - Okay. Their natural enemies are lions and leopards. Their pregnancy lasts for a year, one foal at a time. Han River 10km Race I participated in a 10km race. I won 3rd place. Good job My teacher wants to see you on Wednesday. What for? Some sort of counseling. Cho-won has swimming that day. What did I tell you about that? "What did I tell you?" Should you fart while eating or not? I don't know. Fine. You're not listening to me. You need a big shot. Go bring my purse. No shots. All right. Then you shouldn't fart while eating. Fart outside. Otherwise, you'll get a shot. I don't like shots. Right? Fart outside. - "Fart outside." - That's right. Hi. TAEHEUNG TAILOR SHOP A suit. He grabbed her bag. She thought he was a snatcher. I'm very sorry. He likes that zebra pattern. He probably wanted to see it up close. There's no need to apologize to me. Teach him about it. This isn't the first time. We're sorry. My goodness. How do you know what he's thinking? He looks like a normal person. He doesn't know what money is. He apparently knows this bag is expensive. It's brand-new. You should keep him inside. He's a menace to others. Send him to a nuthouse or a facility. - Did you get the change? - Yes. How much? A roll of gimbap costs 2,000 won. It costs 2,000 won. - In total, it's 6,000 won. - It's 6,000 won. It's 10,000 won minus 6,000 won, so it's 4,000 won. - It's 4,000 won. - See if it's 4,000 won. A facility? A nuthouse? He's neither a criminal nor a nutcase. No matter how expensive your damn bag is, my son isn't interested. So watch your mouth, okay? Don't tell me what to do with my son. How dare you say that to his face? Look. He remembers everything. He is way smarter than you. "Meatballs, cheese, sausage, ketchup... Oranges, noodles... Baby lotion, toilet paper, and instant curry." Okay? - Okay. - Okay. Meatballs dipped in ketchup. Tasty. Next, pork cutlets. "Have a bowl of noodles." "It is soft and smooth and keeps me safe. Whisper." Excuse me. In the fruits section on the first floor, watermelons are on sale for just 5,000 won. The sale lasts only for 30 minutes. The watermelons are from Mount Mudeung. Come have a taste and enjoy the discounted price. Someone is having fun. See you. - Bye. - Bye. Cho-won. Let's go home if you're done. - Cho-won. - Yes? Sign it for me. Can you do that? Yes. Hello. Hello. An interview? - Here, please. - Here? Focus Marathon? Sign Why a marathon? It's so hard. Well, I don't think he wants to study law. Does running help with his autism? His willpower has improved. Most autistic children don't have strong willpower. It's impossible to force them to do something. But Cho-won can finish what he starts no matter how hard it is. Does he like running? Mothers... can read their children's faces and just know how they feel. He looks different when running. As if... Anyway, he couldn't look happier while running. He runs 10km in 36 minutes, right? Yes. Then a sub-3 marathon might be possible too. - A sub-3 marathon? - Yes. It's finishing a marathon in three hours. It's a dream for all amateurs. Do you have any wish? Let's make it a sub-3 marathon for now. - Does he have a coach? - No, not yet. Professional help would be good for him though. Mom. - My swimsuit. - My goodness. There you go again, showing off your body. It's not in the bag? No. That's strange. I put it in the bag. It's not there. That question earlier. Sorry? You asked if I had a wish. I wish Cho-won would die one day before me. That means I have to live to be at least 100 years old. Sub-3: Running a marathon in 3 hours Cho-won, Look at this. You should smile for the camera. If you don't, it doesn't look so nice. It doesn't look nice. You're supposed to smile for the camera. Look here. I say, "Smile," and you smile. Okay, here we go. Smile. - One, two... - Smile. Don't repeat it. Just smile. Here we go again. Smile. - One, two, three. - Smile. Cho-won. Look in the mirror. You look great, don't you? - I look great. - You're so handsome, right? I look handsome. Now, put on a smile. Smile. Raise the corners of your mouth. It looks nice, doesn't it? Try again. Smile. Smile. Don't just say the word. Put on a smile. Smile. Smile. That's right. Like this. There you go. That's much better. - Much better. - One more time. Smile. - Smile. - That's right. - Go. - Go. - You did well in that 10km race. - Yes. Did you feel good or bad? I felt good. - You felt good, right? - Yes. In the next race, - you'll run a longer distance. - A longer distance. How many kilometers? You'll run 42.195km. I'll run 42195km. You'll run 42.195km. I'll run 42.195km. Should you train hard or not? - I should. - That's right. - You should train hard. - Okay. - Are you tired? - Not tired. All right. - Not tired, right? - Right. That's my boy. Let's go. Let's go. You're here. Athletes seem to drink a lot these days. Once we had that former boxing world champion here. He had gained a lot of weight. - How many hours? - It's 200. That's about two months. I know you're here by a court order, but please enjoy your stay. Just teach them gymnastics or something. The kids here are autistic. They're not good at expressing their emotions, and they're not interested in other people. But they're nice kids. Side stretches. The principal approved it. Afternoons would be fine. Please teach my son any time of the day when you're free. I saw you on TV winning the Boston Marathon. It's an honor to meet you. Today's lunch is spinach soup, anchovies, kimchi, steamed egg, and fish cakes. Damn spinach. Class dismissed. You can go in now. Tomorrow, it's soft tofu, garlic scapes, mackerel, and bean sprouts. The day after, it's curry, kimchi, and meatballs. Meatballs dipped in ketchup. Four are in the lead. A marathon for dog lovers? That's a joke. Right. Okay, we'll talk later. Who is it? Hello. Cho-won. Teach me to run. Damn. You live alone? Horses. What are you, stalkers? "For oily hair with dandruff, Dantrol is your answer." If you don't wash your hair often, you get dandruff. He's just glad to see you. It's messy in here. Very messy. Cho-won, let's get to work. My goodness. Food waste worth of... Look, lady. Recycling is important. I stopped running ten years ago. I was sent to this school as punishment. It's 200 hours of community service for a DUI. And I'm not in the mood to train anyone. Do you know what it feels like being punished for 20 years? Please help us. I beg you. I'll even pay you. I'm wearing a suit. Cho-won. - Cho-won. - I'll wear this to my uncle's wedding. Come on. Buy me a suit. Okay. I'll buy you one if you run a marathon. - A necktie too? - Sure. "Cambridge Members, your best choice." Go clean the desk. Go on. Hey! God damn it. How much are you going to pay me? Sorry? I'm not wasting 200 hours for chicken feed. The principal agreed? Sure. Hours you train him will be deducted. We have the school's full support. Cho-won, come here. He's your marathon coach from now on. Say thank you. Thanks, dude. Thank you. Mr. Coach. I already ran ten laps. I'm done. Run more. How many more laps? Whatever, asshole. "Whatever, asshole." - What? - How many laps? What the... "What the..." - Run 20 laps. - "Run 20 laps." - Cho-won. - Yes? Is the coach nice? Yes. What did you do today? I ran my balls off. What? "Run your balls off, asshole." "Does your mom always fuck you around?" He said that? Yes. Didn't I tell you not to come out here? Like mom, like son. Neither one listens. I've come to give you this. It's Cho-won's training journal. Also, I've set up a training program. A program? With whose permission? A full marathon? There's a race in a month. A marathon seems cool, right? "A true human victory." Think again, lady. It's more like running from reality. You're frustrated with your life, so you want to escape. Why did you run? To run from reality? Or did your mother fuck you around? It hurts. Where does it hurt? Are you okay? - It hurts. - It's okay. - It hurts. - It's okay. It's a cramp. You'll be fine. You're torturing him. He can't even express his feelings. You're wrong. He does like to run. He likes running? That's what you think, which is the problem. Sorry? How do you know that? What do you think? Do you know what it feels like running 40km to 50km on a day like this? The sizzling asphalt suffocating you... Your heart almost exploding... It's worse than dying. If you see a truck driving by, you feel like jumping right in front of it. He likes running? Why don't you run and tell me about it? Where are you going? That's enough. There are seven laps left. No run, no noodles. Let's go. Sweet and sour pork... Noodles... Sweet and sour pork... At least I ran for a goal. What about him? To cure his disease? Wait, it's not even a disease. It's just what you want. It pisses me off. Not everybody is cut out for a marathon. He could die. If he fails to pace himself, his heart will explode. You want him dead? Let's go. So you should teach him right! I'm sorry. I won't bother you again. Do me a favor. Don't use bad words around him. He remembers every word and copies it later. Please. I don't want to hear those words out of him. You like running, don't you? I do. - You like running? - Yes. Do you like it or not? I like it. Do your hate it or not? I hate it. You hate it? Let's take a picture. I like it. When is the next race? September 10. That's right. You can do it, can't you? I can. In the 10km race on June 10th, I won third place. That's right. You got the medal for it. I ate noodles and sweet and sour pork. Let's aim for a medal this time too. HAN RIVER 10KM RACE 3RD PLACE WINNER CHO-WON YOON Happy Birthday. Sorry I can't make it. From Dad Give me some water. Hey. Have you gone deaf, or what? Hey, give me some. I can't believe this. CHINESE FOOD DELIVERY Want some? No, thanks. - Come on, eat some. - No, thanks. Suit yourself. Look away. Did you eat, Cho-won? "Fart outside." Good... night. Good night. Plums... They're gone. They're gone. The plums are gone. My plums are gone. Plums. Where are my plums? Where are they? Damn! "The long dry season is over. The wet season has finally come to Serengeti. It now becomes a true haven for grass-eating animals. Look at the mommy zebra with her newborn baby. She will teach her baby how to survive in the wild." - You like animals? - Yes. What's your favorite? Lions? Tigers? Giraffes? Zebras. "Thousands of them live in harmony with antelopes and giraffes. Their natural enemies are lions and leopards. Their pregnancy lasts for a year, one foal at a time. Baby zebras can run upon birth. People have tried to domesticate them, but as zebras are not as strong as donkeys, the efforts proved futile." What's 365 times 75? How about 3 times 7? - Here. - No, thanks. A day like this is good for running. "A day like this is good for running." One, two, three. Backward. Jumping jacks. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two... - Do you like the food? - Sure. Cho-won seems to like you a lot. Really? He asks me every morning what time you check in. No way. He doesn't even seem to want to share any food with me. Does it bother you? He's been taught that way by his mom so he wouldn't get kidnapped. And these kids have no concept of give-and-take. Not even with me. Don't let it bother you. - Cho-won, sit here. - Okay. They like sitting in their usual seats. Do you like me or not? I like you. I like you too. Your legs are? Million dollar legs. What else? - Your body is? - A killer. We'll do a special training today. How nice! That's it. Let's get out now. Put it upside down. So nice. How many pats? A hundred. Nice. When am I running? Man. Forget about running. It's so nice here. - Okay. - Gosh. Now I'm sobering up. You're such a pain. You can go alone, can't you? Yes. Start running, I'll be right over. Okay. How many laps? How many? A hundred. Hello? What about Cho-won? NO PARKING Stop running. One more lap to go. What? You actually ran 100 laps? Feels good running 100 laps? Good. No kidding. Aren't you tired? Not tired. Do you have chest pains? Cho-won has called in sick. What are you doing? Use scissors. Has Cho-won gotten any better since he started running? Have you seen his hands? He has scars on one hand from biting himself. He used to be very bad. I'm not sure if it's running, but he's much better now. His mom isn't satisfied though. You should glue it. Okay? CHO-WON YOON CHO-WON YOON CHO-WON YOON Ring, ring. Hi. Hey there. - It's been a while. - It sure has. - Say hi. - Hi. Hi. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. He's a good runner. - Is he? - A good runner. Potbelly. Potbelly. -One, two, three, -One, two, three, - four, five, six, seven, eight. - four, five, six, seven, eight. -One, two, three, four, -One, two, three, four, - five, six, seven, eight. - five, six, seven, eight. - The Chuncheon Marathon... - The Chuncheon Marathon... - Address is Songpa-gu... - It's an honor. Autograph, please. Okay. Room 1007. Here, your record for 10km. For 10km. - I won third place. - Third place? How many half marathons? - What? - Half marathons. Yes. I knew it. Damn. Hey. Get over here. Come here. - Start out slowly. - Slowly. - Don't follow others. - No following. - Got it? - Got it? God. How far is he ahead? Keep running. Not that fast! - Not that fast! - Follow my bike. Follow. - Run beside the bike. - What? - Slowly. - Slowly. Stop! Hey! Stop right there! I said, not that fast! Not fast. - Cho-won. - What? What's... the fastest animal in Serengeti? - Cheetahs. - Right. "They can run at 113kph. With thin, long body and legs, they're the fastest mammals." But they can't run for long. "Their average lifespan is 16 years." It's because they run too fast. Too fast. To run a long time, you can't start fast. You can't. - Slowly. - Slowly. What happens if a zebra gets tired and falls? What happens? Lions and hyenas eat it. Right? Roar! So scary. - Scary. - So don't run too fast. Not fast. Catch your breath and run again. Breathe. Let's go. Run at this speed. My heart. It's racing. Cho-won's heart is going pitter-patter. Pounding is more like it. Pounding. Say it like this. It's pounding like hell. It's pounding like hell. How does it feel with your heart pounding? Good. Good, isn't it? Here. You have an ID number? What is it? Cho-won's ID number is 850514-1064521. Born in 1985? You're over 19. - You're an adult. - I'm an adult. - You can drink then. - I can drink. - Cheers. - Cheers. - In one gulp! - One gulp. One gulp. You want those? I'll be right back. Hello? Cho-won's mom? He's not ready yet. He can't pace himself alone. You could run with him as a pacemaker. Is it too much to ask? I thought I was a coach. But you're leaving soon. I should take over. Let's go for the Chuncheon Marathon. I've run that course before. I'll train him until then. Free of charge. Going to horse races, drinking... You call that training? What? Are you jealous we're becoming friends? What? Be honest. Are you afraid of losing control over him? Me? This whole thing was a mistake. You do nothing but nap and drink. Not to mention the sauna. You made him run to the point where he couldn't walk. That's training? You call that being friends? You spy on him all day long. That's not maternal love. When will you stop? What, you feel sorry for him now? No, thanks. Just give me your account number. You wish he would die a day before you? No wonder. You know why? You can't survive a day without Cho-won. He doesn't need you. It's you who can't live even for a day without him. He doesn't need a coach. - Let's go. - Says who? He's my son, not yours! This is why he can't even pee without your permission. You're his mom, but you can't own him. You've never raised one. You're crazy. Dad. I'm sorry I couldn't make it to Jung-won's birthday. - We're going to a baseball game. - Hi, Daddy. - You want to come? - Yes. You come and go as you like. Being his friend is easy. But that's not all it takes. Never. Do you want to live with me? As the principal, I've done everything I could to help you. What difference can a marathon make? Teach him job skills and... What difference can job skills make? He can run marathons as a hobby. Don't get too obsessed. Obsessed? I'm just helping him because he likes it. You can't blame me for that. But Cho-won is different from others. No, he's not so different when he runs. - Your legs are? - Million dollar legs. - Your body? - A killer. - Can you do it? - Yes. Okay. My son can do it. "My son can do it." "Four hours." - Cho-won. - Yes? Just follow him, okay? - Should you run fast alone? - Yes. You should? - Shouldn't. - Shouldn't. THALIA MARATHON Go! Keep going. Slow down. Run slowly. Excuse me. - Slow down. - Slow down. Hey, I haven't seen you for ages. How are you? Good. Man. - This is ice-cold. - Let's go. Where are we? Is he breathing? Take him to the hospital. Hurry up. Come here. - What's wrong? - I'm okay. No, doctor. - Stop resisting. - No. I don't want it, doctor. No shots! - I don't want shots. - Stop resisting. - You need it. - Cho-won. - I don't want shots. - Cho-won. A medal... Only those who finished the race get one. Give me a medal. Give me a medal, please. Namsan Marathon Club... A medal. - Here you go. - Thank you. Every runner gets one. Okay. THALIA MARATHON FINISHER MEDAL Cho-won. He can't give you a medal because you didn't finish the race. You want me to calm down? Are you kidding me? You would lose it too if you were me. Damn. He's your son? Money is no issue here. They should rot in jail. You goddamn punks! Say sorry! What's with you? You kicked the side-view mirror because he honked at you? What is wrong with you? Put yourself in his shoes. Wouldn't you be upset? I'm tired, and you're not helping. Have you ever put yourself in my shoes? What? Have you ever tried to understand me? Don't talk back! You've already kicked Dad out. Cho-won is all you care about. You know everything about him. - I am just... - You two aren't the same! If you have a problem, say it instead of causing trouble. I already told you. Tens, hundreds of times! You never listen! Put yourself in his shoes too. I can at least rebel and say I'm sick of you. Hi, Jung-won. Give it back to me. Give it to me. I said, give it to me. - Mom. - Give it to me. It smells. I smell gas. Wait. Cho-won turned off the gas. I opened the windows and the front door too. If it explodes, everyone dies. Are you scared of dying? Do you know what dying is? So dumb. Then run. Until you die. I went swimming today. Mom swam too. Cho-won ran 30 laps. I know. Let's go home. Is Cho-won good or bad? Say, "Cho-won's legs are?" Let's go home. Are you tired? No, not tired. Not tired. A good boy should eat carrots too. A roll of gimbap costs 2,000 won. Cho-won, stay here. Attention, please. We're looking for a missing girl. She has a yellow dress on with a green hat. If you have seen her, please contact the office. Attention, please. We're looking for a missing girl. She has a yellow dress on with a green hat. "The size of South Korea, the Serengeti National Park is a haven for wild animals. It's one of few places on our planet that hasn't been conquered by us humans." Mom. Where is she? - Sorry to keep you waiting. - Thanks. - Thank you. Bye. - Bye. What the fuck? You groped her! Just ignore him. "Female zebras can bear one baby at a time." He's a nutcase. Let's go. Let's just go. "Their pregnancy lasts 276 days." You crazy son of a bitch! Stop. Stop. Why are you hitting my son? - What's the matter? - He deserves it. Why did you hit him? Keep him at home! - Who the hell are you? - "My son... is a special child." "My son is a special child." "My son is a special child." "My son is a special child." "My son is a special child." "My son is a special child." "My son is a special child." "My son is a special child." "My son is a special child." "My son is a special child." "My son is a special child." Does it hurt? No. Thank God. You lost Cho-won. I know. Why did you disappear? You lost Cho-won. At the zoo, you lost Cho-won. What? What did you say? You let go of my hand at the zoo. So you lost Cho-won. At the zoo, you let go of my hand. So you lost Cho-won. You remember? You remember that? No! Cho-won. Cho-won, no. No, Cho-won. Cho-won. No. It's a gastrointestinal perforation. The gastric juice seeped out through a hole. We stitched it up. She'll be fine. She must have had a lot of pain due to the ulcer. Mom is okay now. Your mom is sick, and she is in the hospital. How would you feel, Cho-won? Happy? Sad? Angry? Scared? The rain. It's pouring down. I thought I was helping him. But the truth is, I was only trying to make myself feel happy and better by pushing him around. But I couldn't stop. It was what kept me going. He remembers that we lost him at the zoo. You remember, don't you? In fact, I didn't lose him. I tried to dump him. I... I didn't think I could raise him. You were only 27 years old. Not now. His teacher told me that he never says he's tired even though he is. I always ask him. "Are you tired or not?" "You're not tired, are you? You're having fun, right?" For 15 years, I've been pushing him. Now he never tells me that he's tired or he doesn't like it. He might have been scared that his mom would try to dump him again. That might be why he's been working so hard. I'll end up in hell. Right, honey? I'm a bad mom. I'm a bad mom. If he ran 100 laps, it's almost 40km. If he can pace himself, he has a shot at it. Cho-won likes running. He wants to run that race. Who knows what he thinks? Moms can read their children's mind, can't they? I know. Cookies, noodles, and zebras. Those are things he likes. If I can never let him go, I should make things easy for both of us. You can let him go. You just don't want to. Thanks for everything. I mean it. Bye. What's wrong with you? Finish what you've started! Let's show them he can do it too. He's no different from the others. I'll be his pacemaker. - I'll run with him. - He is different. My son is different. He's not like the others. It took me 20 years to realize that. Do you think 200 hours made a difference? No way. Can I read his mind? If I could, I wouldn't mind dying this instant. Go. He's not doing it. If I were to learn to read his mind, I would have to live long. No more marathon. Never. Get your ice cream! - Thank you. - Thank you. - Good job, boys. - Thank you. Here. Hi, Jung-won. You shouldn't bow to me. No bowing to you. Did you eat? Yes. It's 10,000 won minus 4,000 won. It's 6,000 won. YANGJAECHEON MARATHON CLUB Waste paper Damn. Who is it? Why didn't you pick up your phone? Where's Cho-won? What? Where is Cho-won? Who hasn't paid yet? Okay. Have you trained hard? What should we do with him? Who? Leave him. He must want to run. Okay. - Is he alone? - He came alone today. YANGJAECHEON MARATHON CLUB TO DO TOMORROW Marathon CHUNCHEON MARATHON START AREA Excuse me. Coming through. There. Sorry. Excuse me. Excuse me. Cho-won is in Chuncheon. My number is 1024. - You brat. - The president gave it to me. Why are you here? Why didn't you listen to your mom? What if you got lost? Let's go home. "Meet us at 4:00 p.m. in front of the bus. - Excuse me. - The plate is SEOUL 2345. - Excuse me. - Or call 010-234-4738." Cho-won. Cho-won's address -is Room 1007, Building 3, -Cho-won. Siyoung Apartment, Munjung-Dong, Songpa-Gu, Seoul. The phone number is 405-3788. Mom's cell phone is 016-226-3788. Do you have any idea how worried I was? Didn't I tell you there would be no more running? I'm running the Chuncheon Marathon today. No. This is too hard for you. We're going home. It's October 10 today. The Chuncheon Marathon.
