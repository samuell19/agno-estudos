It was a time in which humanity had set out into space in search of new lands. It was given the name "Universal Century". Humanity entrusted its future to gigantic space colonies constructed around the Earth. However, this second homeland was not their promised paradise. Universal Century 0057. In Side 3, the cluster furthest from Earth, a leader appeared who called for Spacenoid independence and the reformation of the human race. His name was Zeon Zum Deikun. It appeared as if the history of the Earth Sphere would advance even further under his leadership. However, in U.C. 0068. Just as Deikun began a speech, he collapsed. Deikun's sudden death led to rampant speculation. Independence! And even within the Deikun camp, long-simmering factional infighting suddenly erupted. Degwin Zabi, a longtime supporter of Deikun, known as his right arm, did not let this opportunity pass him by. The Zabis and their faction toppled their rivals, the Ral family, and for all intents and purposes, the Zabis seized power in Munzo. Deikun's wife, Astraia, was placed in confinement. And as for his children, Casval and Artesia... My enemy, your enemy, Mother's enemy, everyone's! I'll take them out! They narrowly escaped to Earth along with Jimba Ral, head of the Ral family. Three years later, in Spain's Andalusia region. The children changed their names, Artesia to Sayla, and Casval to Édouard. They had been adopted by the wealthy Teabolo Mass. We could really be father and daughter. However, their fellow exile Jimba Ral was plotting a counterattack against the Zabis, which brought assassins down upon them. Édouard fought off one attacker and saved himself and Sayla, but Jimba Ral was killed. Teabolo was also gravely injured. Heeding the advice of Shu Yashima, head of the Yashima Company, an industrial giant, Teabolo decided to relocate to Texas Colony. Texas Colony was a theme park modeled after the Wild West Era, located in Side 5, also known as Loum. However, a fateful encounter awaited them there. Édouard Mass. I'm Char Aznable! I'd say they've learned their lesson. Meanwhile, Dozle Zabi was secretly developing mobile workers for military use. These would later come to be called "mobile suits". Bring it! Sad tidings reached the ears of Sayla, who had been counting the months until their reunion with their mother. It's Mother... It was news of Astraia's death. No! Zabi! Zabi! Fate was not yet through toying with the siblings. Artesia. We won't see each other again for a while. Édouard bade Sayla farewell in front of Astraia's gravestone. Wait! Don't go, Brother! Casval! There, he set out an a new path. He took his first step towards his vengeance. MOBILE SUIT GUNDAM THE ORIGIN III Casval has left Texas Colony? He's planning to enter Zeon from Loum? Kill him! There isn't a single Zabi who would allow Casval to return! Make certain he's dead. See to it that the public doesn't get the impression that one of Deikun's spawn was murdered. Are you sure you want to go to Zeon without any contacts there? I sure won't be able to pull any strings for you. That suits me fine. I'll find my own path and make my own way. Give me a minute. I'm on a student visa, so I have some paperwork to fill out. Man, that took forever! Stupid immigration slowpokes! What if we miss our flight? Understood. Would you care to explain why you have this? I've never seen that before in my life! I don't know how that got in there! Let's discuss this inside. If I do that, I'll miss my flight! I'm starting school at a military academy! Zeon's! Here's my acceptance letter! I'll miss the matriculation ceremony! I have an idea. Follow my lead. Excuse us. This might take a while, so we should use the restroom first. What the hell, man? I don't need to use the toilet! Casval has entered the restroom with his companion. It looks like his companion's baggage triggered an inspection. Emergency. There is now a chance that he won't be aboard the expected flight. Understood. Await further orders. Roger that. Change places? You and me?! If you want to make flight 107, it's the only way. Hurry! If we take too long, it'll look suspicious! Here! Catch! Give me your papers, too! I'll put them in my suitcase! Oh, good idea. You're throwing in the towel? You're just doing your job. It was a slip-up on my part. Mr. Édouard Mass! Please hurry! You can still catch the flight to Zeon! C-Coming! Thank you! I'll never forget this! Bye! Talk about melodramatic. He sounds like you'll never see each other again. You're right, he does. Casval is heading to the boarding gate by himself. According to plan, then? Carry it out. Roger that. That companion of his doesn't know how lucky he is. Flight 107 to Zeon has departed five minutes behind schedule. Mr. Char Aznable! I'm sorry for the delay, sir. Here is your suitcase. About this, though... I'm told that it's a real gem from the 19th Century. I can see why you would want to bring it, but I'm afraid we're going to have to confiscate it. Is there... anything that you would like to say on the matter? No, not really. The next flight to Zeon is first thing tomorrow morning! Get a good night's sleep! Have a safe trip, Mr. Char Aznable! They're gone! Gone! Gone! My acceptance papers are gone! Sir, please calm down! - You're disturbing the other passengers! - They're gone! Gone! My whole life rides on those papers! Casval, we would have spared you if you had lived out your life in obscurity in Texas. You brought this down on yourself. Dawn of Rebellion The times stand on the threshold of a new stage! Through the difficult times since the first generation of emigrants, space colony dwellers have gone from being called the dispossessed to being the chosen people! We have unexpectedly found ourselves on the forefront of human history! And you cadets are our vanguard! Do not hesitate to consider yourselves the elite! For you are the elite! - You have been rigorously selected - from the chosen people to be here today! It is you cadets who will be the defenders of colony society, as well as the leaders of the new humanity! - The Party Leader sure still loves to hear himself talk. - To break human history free from its stagnation, rouse yourselves to action! Struggle on with the goal of becoming the great military leaders of tomorrow! Stand with me! Join me on the front lines of our battle! Oh, brother... I am Dozle Zabi, and I serve as superintendent of this academy! I am a man who is a straight shooter! Starting today, I'm going to whip you into shape! I don't give a damn if you're the elite, I have no use for the pale and weak! - Anyone who's short on resolve, leave now! The EFSF's Vice-Admiral Revil is here as our guest today! If I may be so bold to say so in front of him, I don't believe in the least that this academy's role is to train a neighborhood watch for the colonies! Rather, it's to produce true soldiers! True officers! That is what I consider its role to be! That is all I wanted to say to you as your superintendent! Incoming cadets will now be introduced! When your name is called, respond and stand! Kei Nishimura, Republic of Loum! Here! Also from Loum, Lu Fang! Here! - Kwaratonga Boer, Hatte! - Here! - Looks like we're gonna be roomies. - Kwaratonga Boer, Hatta! - Here! - Seriously, there's no getting rid of you. Here! Zenna Mia, Moore! Here! - Thomas Zetafar, Zahn! - Here! - There's something different about you. - Rosalinda Halladay, Hatte! - Here! - You think so? - Rosalinda Halladay, Hatte! - Here! - I'm becoming a soldier. I have to change a little. - Yosif Khan, Zeon! - Here! Lino Fernandez, Loum! H-Here! Also from Loum, Char Aznable! Here! Ben Sholander, Loum! Here! Kim Bong Jung, Zeon! Here! Representing the above 265 cadets is Garma Zabi from the Republic of Zeon! Here! Step forward and direct the pledge to Degwin Zabi, Chairman of the Republic! The Zabi heir is our class rep, huh? I hereby pledge... Side 3, Guardian Banchi Autonomous Republic of Zeon Space Defense Military Academy Give me another lap! Sprint the final leg! You're going too fast! Who's the pacesetter? Char Aznable from dorm 3! That jerk... Those guys, on the other hand... Are ridiculously slow... They're a lap behind again! Isn't that Garma? Yeah, and his so-called "Royal Guard"... They're just his flunkies, though. - Nice shot! - Awesome! - That's our Garma! - Yeah! Whoa... Was he that athletic before? By employing Kepler's 2nd Law, we can use this formula to derive the law of universal gravitation. Can anyone calculate this? Garma, then. Wow... Well, he din' get the top score on the entrance exam... 4A squared. Correct. Consequently, we can obtain apogee from... What's gotten into him? Back in high school, I was the better student. Hold it right there. You have terrible manners, you know that? Why did you interrupt me at the blackboard? Interrupt you? You were stuck, so I was trying to give you a hint. I wasn't stuck! I was taking a break, that's all! But you went and shamed me in front of everyone! Apologize! - You heard the man! - Apologize to him! It sounded to me like you were trying to stick it to him. Apologize to Garma! Oh, I see. If that's the case, it's understandable that you would think I was meddling. That was wrong of me. Sorry about that. It's like he's a different person now... - Another in the ten-ring! - Wow! Shouldn't you be focusing on the target and not me? So these are Garma's grades, eh? Academics, A. Military and Physical, only so-so. I shouldn't be surprised. He doesn't share my physical strength. N-No, sir! This Char boy is impressive, though. A's across the board. Unfortunately... Eyeground pigment abnormality, huh? Birthplace: Loum, Texas Colony? Char, what's wrong with your eyes? Cosmic ray damage. They tell me I'll go blind if I don't wear a visor. Oh, I'm... ...really sorry to hear that. Something wrong? No, forget it. That isn't Char! I'm sure of it! Who the hell is that guy? Side 3 Extra Banchi, Dark Colony A surprise inspection?! Crap! This is bad... So, this is what I've heard so much about, Dozle? W-We've got the arms moving great now! Also-- The decision's been made. The MS Project is cancelled. Y-You can't! Not after we've come so far! You've come so far, and it still looks like this? How could this work as a weapon with a bare engine bolted to its back?! Forget it! It's out of the question! It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm Torenov Y. Minovsky, technical advisor for this project. Your criticism is entirely justified, sir. But do not worry. I already know how to solve that problem. These are the schematics of my latest fusion reactor. As you can see, it is a quantum leap smaller than existing models, and there is no impact on its output. The Fluid Pulse System makes use of Minovsky particles. Using it smooths out the drive system and makes active attitude control possible. As you are aware, Minovsky particles block the propagation of electromagnetic waves and inhibit radar and electronic circuits. It is said that they will change the face of warfare. But more than that, they will take the focus of combat away from battleships and precision-guided weapons and give warfare's starring role to a new player. Answer me this, then. When will it be ready? Before the year is out, without fail. Very well. Dozle! I rescind my earlier order! Continue the project! That's my brother! We'll designate the model equipped with this new system MS-03! But don't miss that deadline! The political tides are already changing! Roger that! Fall in! Ten-hut! We will now conduct a loaded march exercise! The total weight of your backpack is 40 kg! Traverse the course with it and return by sundown! - This is brutal... - We have to do 30 km like this? I'm a dead man... Look at how far ahead that guy is already! He's fast... What's he... You've reached Point A! What's your name, cadet? Char Aznable, dorm 3. Okay, you're the first to pass. That was fast. Are you sure you can keep up this pace? Here's a second! Who are you? State your name, cadet! Garma Zabi, dorm 1! - Garma Zabi... - ...passed. - Garma... - ...Zabi? - The Zabi heir? - Wow, he's a real fighter. Time for rainfall! Have the cadets hole up and rest! The rocky areas in particular get dangerous when it rains. Roger that! Rainfall will he 30 mm! That's a lot! Bivouac and dig in tight! They're really making it pour... I wanna go home to Loum... Come join me. It's nice and dry over here. We still have 20 klicks to go. If you catch cold, you'll never make it. Especially a spoiled kid like you. Shut up! Who are you calling a spoiled kid? Don't order me around! Oh, is that how it is? Have it your way. I'll mind my own business. Go on, laugh. I'm a real laugh riot, right? I tried to get ahead of you, and this is what it got me. I'm the worst. I'm a disgrace to the Zabi name! Are you all right? Don't touch me! Don't lay a finger on me! Touch me, and I'll kill you! No, you'd be better off killing me... I'm so pathetic I can't stand it. What do you think? Call it... your palace. Garma's gone missing?! - He was neck and neck for the lead... - ...and he made it up until point B! - LOOK FOR HIM! - Yes, sir! Mobilize everyone you have and find him! Ow! This looks broken. I'd better splint it. Wait here. I'll bring help. Forget it! I'm coming, too! On foot? With this leg? I can walk! If I'm not on my own two feet, it'll mean I've washed out. We don't fail! Not Zabi men! I doubt you'd understand. But you don't have to! You probably think I'm just being stupid and vain. No, I understand fine. This is the 25 km marker. We're searching with all we have, but there's still no... I'm getting a report! You found them? They were apparently just spotted, sir! They're confirming now! I don't see them yet... Here they come! It's both of them! It's Char Aznable and Garma Zabi! They're supporting each other! They're waving! They're both smiling! What's going on, Lino? You moving out? The Dorm Chief told me to change rooms. Looks like Garma's taken a liking to you. Try to get along, you hear? I put in a request. Where's the challenge when you're living with a yes-man? It's boring. We're bunking together starting today. I hope we stay friends forever. What's so funny? You're a spoiled kid, all right. No one else can choose their own roommate. Nobody but the Zabi heir, see? Side 5, Texas Colony - Welcome to Texas Colony. - Hello! How you've grown, Sayla! It's been too long, Mr. Aznable. Mr. Char will be graduating soon, won't he? Well, I have no idea what he's up to. He hasn't come home once, not even over his breaks. Oh... I didn't know. We got a few letters at first, but then nothing. Well, my son's been dead to me ever since he joined the military, so I'm not surprised. Mother, Lucifer, and you too, Casval... I'm back. Mother, I'm going to become a doctor. Do you approve? I decided on that because I've seen far too many people die in my life. Because I've endured so much sadness. Casval... Did you really die? Your name was definitely on the ship's passenger manifest, but I just can't believe it. I feel like you're alive out there somewhere. Approach on the left, then lay down ridgeline fire on P4! We'll get out while they're firing! Got that? Move it! 01 hit! - Direct hit! 01 incapacitated! - This is a slaughter. 01, leave battle line! This is 01! We can still fight! Idiot, if that had been a real round, you'd have been blown to bits! 03, move up farther! Don't waste your ammo! You're still out of effective firing range! Watch it! You'll get yourselves killed! Damn it, these Fed bastards are full of themselves! Char, doesn't this take you back? That lunaball final back in high school. You led the charge back then, too. Oh. Yes, you're right. Everybody spread out! Point 4 taken. - What? - Impossible! - What do you mean, lost? - What squad is that? This is Zenna Mia, Squad 01! We have taken P4! Will now provide spotting for artillery! Char, you did it! Prepare to fire! Fire for effect! Fire! - Overshot, 50! - Overshot, 50! They calculated they were outgunned, so rather than using brute force, they took enemy positions with sneak attacks to use them as spotter locations and made intensive use of their mortars, their sole strike capability. Impressive. I don't know how the Federation military advisor will grade them, but in my books, they get full marks! Here is your review! The purpose of today's mock combat was to ascertain the level of proficiency of you third-year cadets, and I rate your performance as acceptable overall! If all goes well, this means that you will have successfully concluded your special training course, and you will receive your postings! This is only the beginning of your duties! Today, criminal agitators are growing ever bolder in their attempts to alienate the colonies from the Federation! Do not be led astray by their lies! Rather, stand to your duties and-- Question! You have a question? This isn't usually a time for questions, but I'll make an exception. Ask away! Thank you for your generosity. In that case, I will ask two. Question one: If today's exercise was really meant to mimic a real mission, what manner of enemy are we expected to fight at a firepower disadvantage? Question two: You just said that you will not tolerate alienation between the Federation and colonies. If so, does it not mean that this utterly inferior Spacenoid self-defense force is nothing but a sham military whose only purpose is to drive home just how weak the colonies are, sir? He came out and said it! I made an exception for questions. But those weren't questions. I call it insubordination! State your name and unit! Char Aznable, chief of Third Students' Corps. What are those on your face?! Take off those sunglasses! I've been diagnosed with a retinal opsin defect. In conditions where gamma rays exceed a set level, I am allowed to use a vis-- That's not against school regs! Yeah! - He's not breaking regs! - Yeah! It's not against regs! - It's not against regs! - Yeah! It's not against regs! - Apologize! - Apologize! Apologize! Pick up his visor! Yeah! Pick it up! Pick it up! Pick it up! - Pick it up! - Pick it up! - Pick it up! - Pick it up! Pick it up! Pick it up! Pick it up! Pick it up! Pick it up! Pick it up! Pick it up! Pick it up! Pick it up! Pick it up! Sir! I am Garma Zabi, chief of First Students' Corps! He is not breaking any of this academy's regulations. You should pick up his visor and admit your error! That's right! Admit your error, sir! This is a demand! Sir... Pick up... Not against regulations... This is Port Control. You are to hold position. There is an outbound vessel. Hold position! We are on a priority-one mission. Have them change their flight path. Outbound traffic has right of way! Clear the lane! Are you giving us orders?! I said priority-one! You're about to collide! Evade! Evade! Damn it! I'll file a complaint with the Federation! An agricultural block was completely destroyed! The blame entirely rests with that Federation ship that ignored traffic control! - He's right! - Don't take it lying down! The Federation has become nothing more than a pox upon us! Hear, hear! Hear, hear! Finding ourselves in this situation, the words that the great Zeon Zum Deikun tried and failed to speak here, from this very podium, must now be spoken! Independence! Complete independence from the Federation! Independence! Independence! Complete independence! Earthnoids go home! Go back to Earth! Zeon! Zeon! Long live the Republic of Zeon! Area 30, route secured! 31 is still in progress! Currently gathering micro debris. There's not enough collection craft! Requesting Tarara deployment! Send more our way, too! We're swamped aver here, too! Garma, what's that? Oh, that? It's a mobile worker. Mobile... They were originally made for lunar resource extraction, but they can be used for this, too. My brother Dozle is in charge of their development. Char. This is top-secret. But I'll let you in on it. Mobile workers can be repurposed for military use. That's why Dozle is so obsessed with their development. It's reaching the final stages, too. Thanks to Dr. Minovsky's theories, they succeeded in miniaturizing their fusion reactor drive. They're being called mobile suits. Mobile suits, huh? Large ship approaching from open space! No, stop them! We're still working here! Unable to raise them! They won't accept anything but a Federation code! Those idiots! That's an assault landing ship. - It's huge. - Damn it! It's probably on its way to pacify Zum City. Pacify? - Their security forces opened fire. - They opened fire? Oops. We're about to get flattened. Son of a bitch! It's an insult! Don't they know who caused all this in the first place?! Rein them in, Gihren! Are you listening to me? Of course. I merely thought it best to stand back and watch for now. This will trigger a war! A colony state can't win against the Federation! Well, as to that... We'll never know unless we try, will we? You don't seem to understand, Gihren. If these riots cross a line, the Federation Forces will intervene in earnest. The Guardian Banchi garrison force will mobilize. And don't forget! That's where Garma is at this very moment! Calling it a "military academy" might sound pleasant, but Garma is no more than a hostage. The vastly superior Federation force next door will seize it if need be, and they will hold his life in their hands. Let me make myself clear, Gihren! If anything happens to Garma, I'll never forgive you. Never! - They fired again! - Sadists! Garma! - Garma! - Garma! What do you want us to do? Should we be sitting here doing nothing? Hey! Garma's exhausted from working debris cleanup detail! You rookies stay put! Let us worry about it. Garma. We need to talk. The Federation barracks? Attack them?! That's right. We'll take it with a sneak attack and force them to disarm. Their guard is completely down. We can take it if we strike now. You're joking... Are you scared, Garma? You, a man who might lead the Zabi family and take control of all Zeon one day, are scared of a little thing like this? B-But... You can lead us! You're our top student! The shining star of the academy! Char... You saw that assault landing ship, didn't you? That was transporting security forces from Guardian Banchi to Zum City. As we speak, those forces are slaughtering Zum City citizens! What will happen if the troops that are still here are also sent in? If you're the Zabi man you say you are, you can't stand idly by and do nothing. All right. But can we beat them? We can! Take a look. This is a map of the garrison. The garrison houses a full regiment. But of that, one battalion is currently in Zum City, which leaves two battalions here. 2,000 men. That's ten times our numbers! Victory isn't determined by who has more troops. If they're not an organized fighting force, they're just a mob. There are two barrack blocks. In the center are the admin building and regimental HQ. On the opposite side across from there are the armory and heavy machinery hangar. We'll designate these as attack targets A, B, C, and D. I-I'm surprised... When did you put this together? Don't be impressed just yet. There are still important details to work out. One is the docking bay. We need to seize it to prevent any interference from the outside. The second is Superintendent Dozle. My brother is a good man. If we talk to him, I'm sure he'll... That's it! We'd be better off doing this with his help! - I'll go talk to him and-- - Garma! Don't you want to turn the gears of history with your own two hands? The unrest in Zum City continues. Citizens are erecting barricades, and security forces are tiring on them. Further deterioration of the situation is feared. Hey! It's time for lights-out! Go to your rooms and get to bed! You've got guts, breaking regs in your first and second years! I'll have you in front of a hearing! Dorm 2, okay! They're all in. No questions asked. Qumran was crying. Well, his old man din' die in that agricultural block. Garage status? I can open it at any time with the spare key. Gear up and wait in your rooms! Set intercom to comms mode 0024! Char's going out first. The rest of us will follow under Garma's command. Darn! I wanted to go with him! Me, too! - Don't let the Dorm Chief spot you! - It's finally go-time? Just you wait, you Fed bastards... Char! Come here! Something's wrong with this clasp! I can't get it to... Thanks... Char... You won't come with me? I can't. Someone has to sneak in first and create a distraction. Zenna says she'll do it! Sorry. This is a grave responsibility, but if anyone can do it, it's you. I'd rather go into battle with you all, but if this is what you need me to do... All right, then, I'm off. Remember, it'll essentially be the same as that mock combat. Char. About to make your grand exit? You're doing a fine job of playing the leader. You're seriously different from when we were in high school. You know that lunaball final I mentioned during the exercise? There was no such game. I did a little detective work. Édouard Mass of Texas Colony died in a shuttle accident. He was the spitting image of Char Aznable, except his eyes were crystal blue. Blue, just like those of Casval Rem Deikun, son of the late Deikun. You've come back to us, haven't you, Casval?! You've come back to Zeon to get revenge against the Zabis! Revenge? What are you talking about? It's okay! I'll keep your secret! You can trust me, Casval! I'm on your side! I think the Zabis have to pay for poisoning Deikun! Let me help you! What are you talking about? Sorry, but you've lost me. O-Oh, of course. You don't know if you can trust me yet. But if you want to keep your identity a secret, those blue eyes of yours... ...are a dead giveaway. What are those? I modified a set of lunaball headgear. You can't exactly wear that visor into battle, right? What do you think? Does it suit me? Great! You look awesome, Char! Do I? Thank you very much, Lino. To protect our countrymen in Zum City, we will rise up! This may prove to be a momentous event. Because it might well provide the spark for a war between the Federation and Zeon! But think back and remember! Why did we all enroll here? Why did we strive to become soldiers? It was to protect the lives, rights, and property of Spacenoids! It wasn't for the Federation! We mustn't let the Federation garrison force mobilize for crowd control! We mustn't let them murder Zum City citizens! This isn't a rebellion! Isn't that right, everyone?! That's the way, rich boy. You have to look strong. Do you understand, everyone? This is no exercise. This is no mock combat. The bullets will be real! If you get hit, you die! And some of us will, of that you can be sure! Will you stand with me anyway?! Right! Move out! What? She wants to see me? At this hour? To discuss school life problems? With me? Zenna Mia... Ranked eighth in her class, huh? She looks like a solid cadet. If one is having problems, that's normally the counselor's job... Sorry to disturb you, sir! I'm not usually up this late. My apologies, sir. I may as well hear you out. Have a seat. I'm fine here, sir. Suit yourself. So, what seems to be the trouble? Money? Boys? Don't care for the soldier's life anymore? None of the above, sir. I have no complaints about the academy, either. What is it, then? To be honest... I'd like to take up some of your time. Take up... my time? Wh-What the hell is that?! Sir, please remain where you are. - What's the meaning of this?! - Stay where you are! It's an emergency mobilization of the third-year cadet corps. They're on their way to the Federation garrison. Why, you... Superintendent! Col. Dozle! The cadets have gone rogue! Please open the door! You have to stop them! - You little fools! - Don't! Who was it?! Who put them up to this?! Who's stirring them up?! It was Master Garma! Master Garma inspired us to take action! G-Garma did this? Our little Garma is behind this? This is the self-propelled mortar team! Have arrived at firing point! Spotting paint secured!? Good. Commence operation! Open fire! We'll storm the facility! Overshot! Two right! Left, 2! Shorten 500! Fire for effect, open fire! - What the...? - We're under attack? No way! Fire! Will continue support fire! - It's an attack! - We're under attack! - Return fire! - Get outside! Hurry! Command! This is Guardian Banchi garrison! We are under mortar attack! Return fire with heavy weapons! That's an order from the regimental commander! Send out the tanks! Direct hit to control tower! Armory is on fire! Left flank squad neutralizing group D! Good! Have Char storm the control tower! Bastards! Char! Char, Garma says to storm the control tower! I know. Be advised! MBT! Lino! Yeah? Commandeer that 61. You got an A rating in special vehicle operation, right? I'll make a break for the control tower. Got it! You can count on me! Good luck. We'll use 010 for our dedicated comms channel. Crap! I can't see a thing! This is Lino Fernandez. Type-61 successfully commandeered! Now en route to you! Roger that. I knew you could do it. I need a gunner, though! Send someone over! Understood. I'll set it up! Char! Where's Lino?! An enemy tank is coming. Crap! We'll avenge him! - Let's do this! - Yeah! Enemy is advancing from two directions! Still firing! Son of a bitch! Damn those military academy bastards! What's that? Do you read me? It's Lino! Friendlies are drawing a bead on me! What's wrong? Please respond! Casval! Casval! Please respond! Casval, make them stop! Casval! Casval! Casval! Fire! Wh-Why?! Casval! I'm not Casval. I'm Char Aznable. Central block taking fire! It can't take much more! Crap! CRAP! Filthy Zeon punks! What happened? What's keeping the backup generator? You're the regimental commander, I presume? With all due respect, I suggest you surrender. Please order your troops not to offer any resistance. Under the command of Garma Zabi, the uprising of some 200 cadets forced the EFF security forces to lay down arms. Both sides, hold your fire! That is an order! This is Superintendent Dozle! Cadets, fallback too! Dozle... Garma! You crazy kid! Garma! Their actions would later be known as the Dawn Rebellion and would stir the hearts of the citizens of the Republic of Zeon. However, this incident would become the starting point of the One Year War, the greatest tragedy in human history. The Earth Sphere was racing headlong into chaos and darkness. Everything is red. It really is a good color, isn't it? They meet in the gently echoing wind that races through the waving meadow. The world is reflected in their blinking eyes. What do they see ? The distant future? The words that bind them together, their overflowing emotions, they will hold them tight forever to keep them from breaking. Here and now, you are alive, quietly supporting each other. I watch over you as you lay fast sleep. Oh, how much longer will it be until you grow up ? The hazy line of mountains are darkening to deep blue. They hurry to the warm, inviting house. My voice saying "Welcome home," my palms conveying my love, will be held tight in their two hearts forever. You have someone dear to you. Your tears will change to a smile. I'll always rush to your side to comfort you. Look there, night has came. Don't be afraid. Beyond the darkness, a new dawn is waiting to break. You have someone dear to you, so turn your tears into strength. Here and now, you are alive, quietly huddled together. I watch over you as you lay fast asleep. Oh, even after you're all grown up, I'll keep praying for your happiness for all eternity. What's that, Dad? It's Luna II. It used to be the asteroid Juno. It was brought here as a source of raw materials for space colony construction. It became the beachhead for the construction of a new Side at Lagrange 3, but the project was put on hold afterwards and it's turned into a white elephant. Until construction on Side 7 is finally approved, anyway. There's Side 7. It's still being built... Okay, you're cleared. Next! Amuro Ray, age 13! The son of the head of development, huh? I'm going to be even busier than usual. I'll probably be away from home a lot, so you'll be the man of the house. Make some good friends. Work hard so that people know you're the son of Chief Ray. Understand? Haro. Friend. Haro. Amuro's friend. Thank you for your patience. Now arriving at Gate 01. You will be unsteady until you adapt to the G forces. Please be careful. Gate now opening. There will be a slight breeze due to the pressure differential. This is Side 7... Translation, Adaptation and Subtitling: David Fleming
