-Sorry, I was in a hurry. -Watch out! I'll give you my number. I'll pay for it. Hey, Alex! Are you his instructor? Tell your dad, Alex. What am I to you? Don't worry. It was just a scratch. Come on, Alex! Gotta be brave! Bravery is not his strength. Good morning! Ms. Nilse. Today is cake day. -Hi, Maria. -Everyone is waiting for you, Rubens. -Good morning. -Heitor is all alone there. Poor Heitor! Hi, Rubens. Samuca! -So no laziness today? -Hi, son! -It's meet time! -Can you never be on time? Andr?and Bruno are here. Are you wearing your swimsuit? Hey, what's up? How are you, my reds? I want to see you kicking those legs. Kick for speed! What's up? Alex! Come on! Attention, take your positions! Let's go! Go! Go! Go, kid! Go! Go! Now back! Back! Come on! Don't slow down! Go! Go! Come on! Come on, don't give up! Come on, kid! Come on! Go! Bronze medal. Congratulations, Fred. Silver medal, second place. Keep your head up, Alex. -Well done! -Alex! Congratulations. Gold medal, Bruno. Congratulations. Alex! Alex! Don't leave your stuff around! If it's wet, put it in a bag, with your towel, ok? -Your shirt is inside out. -It's not. Yes, it is. Look, here's the tag. Wanna talk about what happened? -Alex? -No! Alex is crying because he lost. -He cries about everything. -Bruno, stop it. Stop it! What's this? -He started it! -He's lying! Stop it! Both of you. I don't want any fights in here. Come with me. Why are you fighting? What was our agreement? -What? -We must be considerate winners. Good. What else? And not be sore losers. Alex? Not be sore losers. Now shake hands, like men. That's it. See you later. Let's get your stuff. Hi. You finally showed up. I feel sorry for Alex. Did you have to make a scene? The boy losing wasn't enough? You must stop coddling him. You should be in there with him. -Hi, son! -Hey, kiddo. Why aren't you wearing your medal? Swallow those tears, boy. Don't worry about the car. It was just a scratch. -Did you hit his car? -Bye, Alex! Congratulations. Let's go home? Come on. I don't wanna go. Can I stay with you? Come on, son, move. Son! You're always stalling. Who collected everything? I was with the parents. Some parents fuck up a kid's mind. Do you want to get in trouble again? -Are you afraid of a cigarette? -Don't complain later. You love to play the good guy. I'm sure you'd love to slap that nasty little girl. -Adriana. -She's a real pain. Her mother is worse. She may be a problem mom, but she's damn hot. I saw the way you look at her. Shut up, man. The kind of cougar we would do out of anger. -Just to see if she gets real. -You're nuts. Like this: "Come on, come here! Come and see, Adriana! See what I do to your mother. Just so you stop being annoying!" -Come here, hottie! -Cut it out, Rubens! I can't tell if you are mad or horny. Did you think about what I asked? No way, man. I can't handle another class. -It would get me in trouble. -What kind of trouble? Notes, glances... What do you mean? They're only 12. Only 12? Today they know more at 12 than you and I. Think I never caught one of yours looking at this? Watch what you say. Cris is really smart. Have you seen the pictures she posts? Come here. Look. Only 12. -Why did you add her? -She invited me. She never invited me. If I were you, I would unfriend her. You talk as if she were a public threat. And you talk about her as if she were a sex machine. I love you! Don't go! Kick your feet! Let's splash everyone! Well done! Here's the curve! Fred, use your goggles! Watch the curve! Come on! Come on, Fred! That's it! -Ms. Ana? The principal? -That's me. Nice to meet you. I'm Davi, Alex's father, from the red swimming class. Right, I remember you from the meet day. I'm sorry. Hi, Marisa. I'm here. I'll call you later. Ok. Sorry. Is Alex alright? I didn't see him in class. -He didn't want to come. -Why? -Can we talk in your office? -Sure. -Thank you. -Make yourself comfortable. Thanks. My son has been swimming here for a long time. I know. Everyone here is fond of Alex. What's the name of his instructor? In the red class. Rubens. Is he gay? I don't understand why you're asking this. Did you ever talk to him about this? No. And I won't either. I don't have the right to ask him that. But is he? I don't know. Coffee? So you don't know exactly who takes care of the students. Well, it doesn't matter whether he is homosexual. If he were, would it be a problem? No, of course not. I have many gay friends. But it would be, if he were a pervert. A pervert? Listen, I've known Rubens for a long time. He is our best instructor. How do you know he never crossed the line with the kids? My son Alex told his mother that this guy... That this guy kissed him on the lips. In class, last week. Alex loves Rubens. It must be a misunderstanding. He doesn't want to come. Maybe it was a spontaneous gesture, without malice. A kiss on his mouth? This is a serious accusation. I want to see the images of the security cameras. Now. You can't come here talking like this. The images belong to the club. If he continues teaching here, my son won't swim here anymore. The decision is up to you. It's your right. You won't fire the instructor? You won't do anything? Not this way. Very well. I hope you know what you're doing. Goodbye. Get on it! Get on it! How can I see last week's images? I can find them for you. Ok. I want to see the images of the swimming class. Please, locate those. But don't mention it to anyone. Did you see Ana? -No. -She was looking for you. -What does she want? -How should I know? I'm not in the mood for Ana's PMS. -Can I come in? Rubens? -Just a second, Ana. Shit! What are you laughing at? Were you smoking in here? Of course not. -Well, I'm leaving. -No, wait. Heitor, could you give us a second? I want to talk to you about Alex. Is something wrong? He missed class. He doesn't want to come to class. It must be because of the meet. No, I'm not talking about that. No? What is it? Have a seat. Why do I have to sit? I don't want to. What happened with Alex last Friday? -Friday? -Before the meet. I asked them to practice some laps. Alex didn't want to get in the water. He said he was scared. Then he started crying. What did you do then? I didn't scold him, didn't yell at him. I didn't do any of that. You know how my relationship with the kids is. Sorry. Rubens, I got a complaint. About me? Are you sure you told me everything? -There's nothing to tell. -No need to get like that. You're making me nervous. -Then stay calm. -You stay calm. Why did you go to the locker room, instead of talking to him in front of everyone? How do you know that we went to the locker room? Is that why his father was here today? Alex said you were very affectionate with him. I'm affectionate with all the kids. Too affectionate. I don't understand. You kissed Alex's lips in the locker room. He told his mother that. And you believed it? He is a child. Exactly. -Let's go! -We're still talking. Sorry. -Wait, Rubens. -I'll have a smoke. I can't smoke in here. -You've been smoking in here! -No, we haven't. I can smell it, Heitor! I'm not crazy. No... Well, at least I'm not. Can I have a drag? You're 16 years old. So? I even smoke other stuff. Ask someone else, or buy it when you're 18. You're so nice today. Edu, go play with your friends. Well, I want to talk to you about Vitor, remember? I did what you told me to. It happened! Right in front of everyone! We looked at each other, then... You can tell me later. Alright? Alright. Hello? Hello? Hello? Who is this? If we had planned, I would have gotten groceries. The fridge is always empty. I didn't know you were here. Aren't you happy to see me? Are you here to watch TV? I wanted out of the club, to chill out. Is something wrong? -Sort of. -Sort of? It's nothing. Forget it. What is it? A student's father complained about me. He says I mistreated his son. You? Those kids love you. Apparently not. -Mistreated how? -I didn't do anything, Sofia. Maybe you had a bad day, it happens. What happens? Why are you talking to me like this? Sorry, my bad. I love that you came home for lunch. -Sofia, there's no time for that. -Yes, there is. No, please stop. Stop, Sofia! -You're acting weird. -Weird? What? Grow up! I was just kidding. I'm not in the mood today. Ok. Mom? Why must we wait for my dad? -He's on his way, son. -But he never takes me. He just wants to spend more time with you. Mom, did I do something wrong? Of course not. You didn't. There he is. What's up, champ? Come here. Here, don't let him miss class. -Grab your backpack. -Bye, son! Put the seatbelt on. -Bye. -And? How was it? -What? -What did they say? -Nothing yet. -Nothing? -We need to wait, Marisa. -Wait? -Do you get what happened? -Lower your voice. -What if it's a misunderstanding? -You don't believe your own son? Ok, I'll talk to him. For now, he won't go swimming. He'll never go back there! You think that'll solve it? -I don't think anything yet. -But you should. -Let's go, son. -Alright, let's wait then. What are you playing, son? -Is it Mini Craft? -It's called Minecraft. Everyone likes to play that, right? Kids at the swimming class, too? Son, your mother told me what you said about... your instructor, Rubens. You can talk to me just like you talk to her. Don't be ashamed. Alex? Alex, look at me when I talk to you. Alex? Alex! DEAR PARENTS, I WRITE WITH A FEELING OF PROFOUND INDIGNATION. I FEAR THAT AN INADEQUATE... DANGEROUS PROFESSIONAL IS IN CHARGE OF OUR KIDS. RECENTLY, DURING A SWIMMING CLASS, ONE OF THEM WAS EXCESSIVELY AFFECTIONATE TO MY SON. NOW THE BOY IS TRAUMATIZED. AFFECTIONATE, HOW? MARISA, I'LL CALL YOU. WE WANT TO FILE A COMPLAINT. MY FRIEND IS A POLICEMAN. I CAN TALK TO HIM. THIS GUY CAN'T GIVE LESSONS TO CHILDREN! GREAT, MARCOS, THANK YOU. WE ARE REALLY SHAKEN! YOU CAN COUNT ON US. SHOULDN'T WE WAIT? DOES THE DIRECTOR KNOW? WE CAN'T WAIT. WHO WAS THE INSTRUCTOR? FROM THE RED CLASS I ALWAYS THOUGHT HE WAS WEIRD. RUBENS IS A GREAT INSTRUCTOR. WE MUST CHECK WHAT HAPPENED. MARISA, I UNDERSTAND YOUR SHOCK, BUT KIDS IMAGINE THINGS. THE KIDS LOVE RUBENS. WHAT IF IT'S TRUE, MARCIA? THAT'S OUTRAGEOUS! MARISA, PLEASE TELL US MORE. DAVI AND I NOTICED THAT ALEX WAS UNUSUALLY SAD. QUIET. NERVOUS. AFTER THE MEET, HE DIDN'T WANT TO GO BACK TO THE CLUB. I TALKED TO HIM AND HE TOLD ME ABOUT WHAT... ABOUT THE KISS. KISS? ON THE MOUTH? Let's go, son. Wait, son. Wait. I'm sorry for yelling at you. I'm a little nervous. Go to your class. Please record a voice message after the tone. Marisa? Have you gone mad? Call me! -Hi, Rubens. -What's up? Are you teaching the afternoon class? -Yes, why wouldn't I? -I just wanted to know. -Are you coming? -I'll be right there. Stay out of it, Maria. I WANT JUSTICE! I NEED EVERYONE'S SUPPORT! I'M PROUD OF YOU. YOU'RE SO BRAVE TO SHARE THIS. I HOPE THE OFFENDER IS PUNISHED. HE CAN'T BE TEACHING! WE MUST DO SOMETHING! MARISA, COUNT ON ME. I HAVE A GOOD LAWYER FOR YOU. I'M HERE FOR WHATEVER YOU NEED! BASTARD! THIS CAN MESS UP THE KIDS. WE MUST ACT! I'VE HEARD SIMILAR STORIES. IT CAN'T GO UNPUNISHED! THAT'S OUTRAGEOUS, MARISA! IF IT IS WHO I THINK, THAT GUY IS WEIRD. MARISA, I'LL CALL YOU. COUNT ON ME. HOW SAD. SHARES What are you doing? It's almost time for the afternoon class. You're really teaching this class? Why wouldn't I? -What's up, man? -Nothing. What did Ana want with you? She wanted to talk to me. About Alex. What did she tell you? Ana didn't say anything. Didn't you see what his mother posted on the Internet? What did she post? What did you do to that boy? What do you think I did to that boy? I think you should tell the whole story. What story, man? It's me; you know me. We've worked together for ages. Yes, I know you. Look at the pictures you post. The things you say about the female students. -I warned you. -That doesn't mean anything. It doesn't? It was just a comment between us. We've said worse things. You said worse. Think whatever you like. Coward. Let's go, people, it's time. In the pool. Rubens. I'm sorry, man, this story is just... I'll take care of it. I just got confused. Everybody decided to get confused today. Rubens, it looks like some kid lost a trunk and flip flops. Have you seen them? Rubens! No, I don't know. Let's go, people, 50-m front crawl to start. Gabriel, kick your legs. Right. Stretch your arms! Let's go, let's go. In the water, come on! Kick your legs! Stretch your arms, Gabriel! It's all over WhatsApp. I don't know what to do. Well, it's a delicate situation, but we are... Ana... Coach! No, honey. You're not going to class. Hold on a little. Look at me. -Hello? -Hi, it's me. -What do you want? -Let me in. It's about Alex. -You don't pick up? -What do you want? You shouldn't have posted that. You shouldn't doubt your son. -He didn't say a word. -He fears you. He doesn't feel safe with you. There you have it. Everybody is saying that a man kissed our son. What do you mean? -He was harassed. -By a man! That's your concern? That they'll say your son is gay? -He's a child, Davi. -He's a child, not a... What will you say about your son now? Ok, Marisa, let's handle this together. We'll get rid of the instructor. Everyone should know who that pedophile is! Stop stoking the fire! Ok, how did it go? He came in, looked at you and said that the guy kissed him, is that it? -Yes. -Yes, what? I told you. We came home, he said he'd been crying, then that weirdo took him inside and kissed him. On the lips? Davi, if you're not brave enough to face the truth, I am. If you don't go to the precinct to report him, I will. Got it? Ana? -I want to talk to you. -Not now, Heitor. It's important. Is this story about Rubens true? What did he do? He says he didn't do anything. Why are the parents so concerned? Because they're parents. I knew that his ways would get him in trouble. What ways? His ways, Ana, you know. I don't see any problem with Rubens' ways. I like the way he works. He's spontaneous. I've also been an instructor. We used to shower naked with the students. No one would say anything. It would be a scandal today. I'm not judging anyone, Ana. I don't want people to distrust me, too. No one said anything about you. Have you considered if this is true? It could be bad for everyone. For the club, for me, for you... Who has access to that post? Only those in the group. Can it be deleted? It can be. But many people already shared it. Other things could come up. Like what? Like what, Heitor? This was in his locker. It belongs to Alex. DELETING UNKNOWN NUMBER Damn it. REGIONAL POLICE -Come in! -Officer. Good afternoon. Davi? Please, come in. Thanks, Jonas. Bring us coffee, please. Marcos told me you were coming. Have a seat. I don't really know Marcos very well. He told me. Apparently, your sons swim together, right? And last week there was this... incident. No one knows exactly what happened. He mentioned it. But what exactly did your son say? He didn't talk to me, only to his mother. And can't she file the report? Yes, she can. She asked me to come. So, what happens with this report? It leads to an investigation. We must figure out what happened. In your experience, this being told by a child, what do you think? We'll talk to your son. We have social workers who are familiar with these situations. -Thanks, Jonas. -Thank you. What if it's not true? Usually we can tell. We ask the instructor here to talk, we inquire among the students... We'll also talk to the parents. Did you notice anything different about your son? -A change of behavior? -No. Any bruises? Bleeding? Is he complaining about aches? There is also a forensic examination. My God. Will my son have to do this examination? If nothing happened, it all goes back to normal. Life goes on and everybody goes home. Life goes on. Life goes on is a figure of speech. It is delicate, of course. Rubens! I was looking for you. I'm on my break. We didn't finish our talk. Please, come up here. Stop acting like this. I just want to talk. To talk or to accuse? If you didn't do anything, you shouldn't worry. Shouldn't I? I see the way you look at me. I don't want Alex or any kid being afraid of me. Then tell me it's not true. I did nothing wrong. He wouldn't stop crying. It was a spontaneous gesture. I hugged him, kissed him... A kiss on his cheek. You shouldn't have kissed that boy. It was affectionate, not abusive. That depends on the point of view. I'll talk with him. You won't see him anymore. His father removed him from class. He shouldn't. It'll be worse. Rubens, are you gay? You can't ask me that. I know. I've been here for 5 years and nothing ever happened. Are you or aren't you? What if I were? What does it matter? Why don't you answer me? -Rubens! -Sofia? What are you doing here? -Why didn't you tell me? -Sofia, not here. -Did you see what they're saying? -It's not true. Of course it's not true. You should sue that woman. We have to go to the police. -Are you ok? -Yes. No. I don't know. What a bunch of chauvinists, old, narrow-minded people. I don't understand why Alex said that. Me, of all people. Hey, stop blaming yourself. You didn't do anything. Right? -Everybody thinks I did. -I don't. Rubens... Ana, this is Sofia. Nice to meet you. I'm his girlfriend. -Go to my place. -Ok. Ana, Rubens didn't do anything. People saying he did are irresponsible. -You must act. -Calm down. Calm down? How could I? This is an injustice. -Let me handle this. -How? Alone? -Won't she do anything? -Sofia! This is my work! Please. Alright. I'll wait at your place. What did you want to tell me? I've ordered the pool closed. Ok. Just for a few days. Come in. Come in! Excuse me. Your line was busy. -What is it? Another parent? -No, it's the police. Good afternoon. -Good afternoon. -Can we talk for a moment? -Sure. -Wait for me here, please. Soon we won't be allowed to go near those kids. The parents want to teach us how to do our work. Do you really believe this instructor? Or are you afraid for the club? Everything is happening so fast... It's better this way. For whom? Was it here? Was it here that you kissed my son? Why did you do it? Your little attitude can't fool me. You know what they do to people like you? I'm talking to you, faggot! -Leave your stuff here. -Hands off. The police will search you. Police? Children forget swimsuits every day. Right, Ana? We collect stuff everywhere and put it away. Regardless of that, I'll ask you to come with me. This is a big misunderstanding. No, it isn't. His name is on the shorts! -Officer. -Mr. Davi, please. I can tell you exactly what happened. Great, but you'll explain it at the station. What will I say there that can't be said here? Would you rather go by force? You have no right to embarrass me at my workplace. No one is arresting you. You're being summoned to make a statement. Do you have the images? Please, restrict the access to Rubens' locker. Ok. I'll be here waiting for you. Do whatever suits you, Ana. Thank you for your cooperation. Let's go. -Tell them it's a lie, Rubens! -Keep calm, Edu. Why? You never did anything to anyone! -It'll be alright. -I was his student. He taught me how to swim. I have the right to speak up. He never did anything to me. -Let the police handle this. -I'm sorry. I told them not to do it. What? Let's go, instructor. PEDOPHILE Assholes. Pervert! Happy? What's all this fuss for? If you had listened to me, it could have been different. How? Do you have children? You don't, I can tell. If you did, you would understand. We can't protect our children from everything. -I just want the truth. -No, you want a culprit. You don't know me. You're condemning someone without being sure. I should leave. You can sit there. Do you have a cigarette? Do you have one or not? Will you smoke in here? I won't tell anyone you gave it to me, relax. Lighter? -Do you want a drag? -No, thanks. Why are you here? For nothing. What a coincidence. I'm here for nothing, too. It'll be easier if we're frank with each other. Officer, I have nothing to hide. So the boy lied to his mother? You know that children invent, and they embellish stories. I know all about children's imagination. I do, too. I work with children. I am with them every day. You should've known better than to take the boy to the only place without cameras. Instructor, what did you do exactly? I wanted Alex to go in the pool. There was an upcoming meet and they had to practice. Alex didn't want to. He has been jumpy lately. What do you mean? Crying, harassing other kids, disobedient. Then I took him to the locker room to talk. Away from everybody? I didn't want the children to see. -See what? -Our conversation! And what happened after? Nothing. We talked, he stopped crying and left. But why would he make this story up? I don't know. You should ask his parents. We've already talked to his parents. My word doesn't count? And the boy's word? Doesn't it count? And his swimsuit? He could have forgotten it! It's your word against a piece of evidence. It was among many other things. They forget towels, goggles, swimming caps, everything! You're nervous. I'll get you some water. How long have you been working with children? In this club, for 5 years. But I've taught physical education in other schools. Have you worked with older kids, teenagers? I get along well with the little ones. They like me, trust me. They feel safe. That teen who talked to you at the club, was he your student? Yes, when I started. -And you know each other well? -Yes, from the club. -Why bring up Edu? -Is he a homosexual? Ask him. As an educator, what do you think? -I don't understand. -He seems to really like you. The club director told us your girlfriend came by. Doesn't she find this story confusing, strange? Sofia believes in me. My daughter's name. How old is she? She's 18... 19. Just turned 19. Was she your student, too? Instructor, do you have a lawyer? Lawyer? Wasn't this just a statement? The investigation will continue. It's good to have a lawyer. I never needed a lawyer. A good public defender can help you. You speak as if I were guilty. SWIMMING INSTRUCTOR ACCUSED OF MOLESTING 8-YEAR-OLD MOTHER'S ONLINE COMPLAINT GENERATES PROTESTS THE INSTRUCTOR, 33, IS ACCUSED OF KISSING THE 8-YEAR-OLD ON THE LIPS. THE BOY TOLD HIS MOTHER HE WAS CARESSED. SOME SAY THE MOTHER SHOULD NOT HAVE USED SOCIAL MEDIA. THE POLICE INTERVIEWED THE INSTRUCTOR. If I were you, I'd go to the paint shop. That's mean. The car was brand new. Rubens! How was it there? Rubens, we'll help you get a lawyer. -Lawyer. -Yes, Rubens. Ana, did you ever kiss one of those kids? Yes. But it's different. Different how? Because you're a woman? If I had scolded or slapped him, it would be ok. Of course not. Why don't you believe me? -The parents worry... -Not the parents. I wanna know what you think. They are their children. We've known each other for ages. You know very well... I don't know anything well. Not about you, not about anyone. Do you think I could do that? -It's normal that parents... -Normal? I think it's understandable that they're afraid. I'm afraid, Ana! PEDOPHILE He'll sleep until tomorrow. Don't you think he's too warm? I'll get the thermometer. It was here this morning. -He's fine. -No, he's hot. He's alright, Marisa. Relax. I'm leaving. Dad! Are you leaving? Stay here with me tonight. Rubens, calm down. What are you doing? I'm going to work. Are you crazy, Rubens? Lay down, c'mon. Rubens! There's no class! Rubens, Ms. Ana does not allow you into the building. I have class. -Rubens... -Didn't you hear the guard? -You can't be here. -I have class! -Dad, don't! -Hey, are you crazy? Asshole! Cut it out! -Did it hurt, pedophile? -Stop it! -It's him. Get the camera. -Does it hurt? Is it close? -He should die! -Enough! Pervert! -Stop it. -Get out of here! -Calm down. -With this guy? Look, guys... That's enough! You don't teach here anymore! -Enough. -Go away! Hold him! Film him and post it online!
