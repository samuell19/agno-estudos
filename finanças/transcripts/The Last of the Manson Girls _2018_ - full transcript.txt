Fuck You, Krassner Thank you, Mr. President. So, yeah, Nixon won. He was looking good in those debates against Humphrey though. I mean, he's sweating less than he used to. I wonder if he's using a new antiperspirant or if he just wakes up every morning and rubs himself with the ashes of JFK. But we're stuck with him now because George Wallace woke up and saw his own shadow which means eight more years of Vietnam. Although I do wish Lenny Bruce was still alive for this. He could finally call the President a dick and not get arrested for it. Hey, don't blame me though. I did my part. I actually worked with the Yippies to organize the protests for the 68 democratic convention. Trust me when I say that was not meant to be a riot. We were trying to save the riot for the republicans. But I don't know for the Yippies, we don't separate our culture and our politics. I mean for us there's this direct linear connection between a kid getting arrested for pot in this country and a kid getting burned to death with napalm on the other side of the globe. So, the Yippies, we organized this movement. And it was big, and it was mad, and it was beautiful. And we could actually feel the world making this real progress. But then, something happened, and all that changed. Friday night in Los Angeles, a movie actress and four of her friends were murdered, and the circumstances were lurid. In a scene described by one investigator as reminiscent of a weird religious rite. The movie actress was Sharon Tate, 26. Honey blonde hair, beautiful, married to a famous director, about to have his baby. Her acting career is just starting to take off. It's the American Dream, right? Yeah, until it wasn't. While the police admitted they had no suspects in the Bel Air massacre, there were two more murders 15 miles away in the Silver Lake section of Los Angeles. Market owner Leno Labianca and his wife Rosemary were found by their children stabbed and mutilated. Hollywood was more anxiety ridden than ever. You could cut the fear with a knife. Yeah I probably could have worded that better. A wandering band of members of a so-called religious cult with a leader they call Jesus has had three of it's followers arrested in the investigation of the murder of Sharon Tate and six others. Charles Manson was America's Frankenstein monster, a logical product of the prison system in which he spent half his life; racist, paranoid, and violent. Once released, Manson collected disillusioned middle class runaways using sex, hallucinogenic drugs, and brainwashing techniques he'd learned while incarcerated. He programmed his followers to be near replicas of himself. You have to make love to it. You have to know it. You have to know every part of it. And to know you know it is to know it, so that you can pick it up at any second and shoot. Whatever is necessary to do, you do it. When somebody needs to be killed, there is no wrong. You do it. This? I'm X-ed out. It means I'm taking myself out of your society. I'm taking my thought out of your tower. I'm X-ed out. Out of your system and out of your world. Manson's trial got international media attention. Even Nixon got involved. I guess he doesn't have anything better to do. The people in power better give it up. Nixon better give it up because if he doesn't the whole thing's going to be destroyed. Manson's followers, the ones who weren't in jail, would hold this vigil for him outside of the courthouse. What do you know? Listen, they've hid his word from you. Charlie hasn't been able to speak in the courtroom. The defendants haven't been able to put on a defense. They've thrown the constitution in the wastebasket. Where does that leave your law. It's anarchy. Total anarchy is coming. Just your run of the mill psycho hippie cult murderers, right? Yeah, that's what I thought until I heard Mae Brussell's conspiracy program. Charles Manson was a patsy, same as Lee Harvey Oswald, Sirhan Sirhan, and James Earl Ray. The so-called Manson murders was part of a hidden war against the youth culture orchestrated by military intelligence. After the Manson murders, people didn't trust hippies anymore. And why would they? Any long-haired flower child could be a Helter Skelter cultist. Mae Brussell had been collecting proof of a CIA conspiracy to install a fascist U.S. oligarchy since the JFK assassination. A satire about Manson's involvement in a government plot to destroy the counterculture could mean big sales for my magazine, The Realist. So I invited her to my office to see how much she really knew about the Manson murders. I'm not even a stand-up comedian. I am a social satirist, and a writer and a publisher. I mean seriously, you folks have wasted your money tonight. Don't get me wrong. It's going to help me turn my water back on, but that doesn't make you any less duped. I don't really believe any of this Manson conspiracy stuff. I'm writing a satirical piece for The Realist. You know how you reinforce the status quo, Paul? By making those trying to change it look dangerous. It was Tex Watson, not Manson who led the female killers on both nights of murder. Before the murders, Tex Watson was in contact with a Navel Intelligence officer, first initial N, last name Dight. Like Light but with a D. N. Dight? To Mae, there were no accidents. Her mantra was, "There are no justs." Charlie Manson couldn't have just sent out four kids to slaughter people they didn't even know. Tex Watson couldn't just be a Texas yokel enamored by Manson's harem of girls. N. Dight couldn't just be a figment of some paranoid revolutionary's imagination. Dight presented himself as a hippie artist but he was really a west coast conduit for CIA funds in medical research, electrode implants, LSD experiments. Mae, this is California. Here that's just, you know, Tuesday. Right. No justs. Find Dight. Get him on the record and he can confirm or deny it, can't he? Sure, find a CIA spook and get him to spill on the biggest murder of the 20th century. How do you suppose I do that? You can't start by reading your mail. I can't get an interview with Manson. I've tried. He writes you. But it's all gibberish about Christ and Satan and scorpions and shit. Read between the lines. This is all just nonsense. There are no justs, Paul. Holy shit. There really are no justs. Hello? Squeaky? Yes, this is Lyn Fromme. Hey. Hi. To whom am I speaking? I'm Paul Krassner. I publish a magazine called The Realist. Charlie said you'd be calling us. He did. Uh-Huh. Charlie wrote me a letter. He said to give you a call. Did he say why? He didn't. But I would like to talk to you. That's all journalist wants to do. Nothing but talk, talk, talk. Everybody has all sorts of questions they just have to have answered. What answers are you looking for, Paul? I'd like to ask about N. Dight? N. Dight? Do you know him? Do you have any acid, Paul? Sorry? Lysergic acid. LSD. The guy who we used to get it from disappeared. We went to his house and he's just gone. I don't know if he was thrown in jail or what. Uh-huh. Do you have any? I do. Come see us, Paul. Come see me. Squeaky Fromme. She's no more assuming than your typical red-headed waitress who likes to sneak a couple tokes of pot in the bathroom. You know, the type of girl you can really bring home to mom. Just tell your mom to hide all the kitchen knives first. What's the worst that can happen? Well there's that. Hey man, what are you up to? You some kind of pervert, man? No, my name's Paul Krassner. I'm a journalist. We got nothing to say to the press. You're worse than the cops. No, I called see. I talked to Squeaky and she said-- Oh, we don't call her that anymore. Look, if I could just talk to Squeaky-- Brenda, it's fine. Paul is a friend of ours. We've been expecting him. He's a fucking news pig. No, he writes for that funny magazine you like, The Realist. The one that's makes fun of Nixon. Yeah, it is. Fuck Nixon. Sorry man. Just a little paranoid. that's all. Cops are always shaking us down. Sandy here just got of jail and, uh... Well why didn't you tell me that we were gonna have company? I would have bought more rice. Sorry. Brenda's she's-- Brenda McCann. So you're Sandra Good. Am I? Did she say you just got out of jail? Oh, it was nothing. Six months for helping a prisoner bust out of L.A. county lock-up. Allegedly. I know, right. The system makes everyone a prisoner. Holding even one person against their will when we're all in a cage, it's just baloney, you know? I'm sorry. I'm being rude. Won't you come in? We're out of milk too. Jesus, nobody tells me anything. We're not going to hurt you, Paul. Squeaky? Welcome home, Paul. Uh, home? This is our home, isn't it? Your home. Isn't that what I said? What did I say? You said "Welcome home" like I lived here. Make yourself at home is all I meant. Our home is your home, Paul. As much as you want it to be. And don't call me Squeaky. Lyn is fine. No, no, no, don't you fucking walk away from me. Thanks for having me over. No problem, Paul. / You're welcome. / Sure. I watched you once. Sorry? I saw you do stand-up at The Committee in San Francisco a few years ago. Oh yeah, The Committee. Right. Did you like the show? It was far out. You know, funny but heavy too. When I first met Charlie and people asked me what he was like. I compared him to Lenny Bruce and you. That's the weirdest compliment I've ever gotten. We were good friends, you know. Me and Lenny, not me and Manson. Charlie. You could be friends with Charlie if you want to. He'd like you I bet. I sure hope so. What's that supposed to mean? No, I just, um, I, I, I, I just-- You just, you just, you just what? Uh, I, I, mean, um... you're-- We're what, huh? The Manson Family? A bunch of psycho hippie cult members who are responsible for seven murders? Nine. Well, um, there's Hinman and Shea, the five Tate victims, and the LaBiancas makes nine. I told you. He's just like the fucking rest. What rest? I'm not like the rest. The rest they're, pshh, I mean especially the dead rest if that's the rest that you're talking about. We're not what The Bug says we are. What's The Bug? Vince Bugliosi, the prosecutor. He's the one who told all those Helter Skelter lies when he put Charlie back in the joint. The Bug made us look like some crazy Satanic death cult. All so he could be the one who got Charlie Manson. The Bug couldn't understand the big picture. The young people are rising up. There's a revolution coming. In your schools. In your courtrooms. In all your institutions built on lies. The prison doors are going to open wide. The balance of power is shifting. Those condemned to die will find a new life. There's a reckoning on the horizon. Where those sentenced in false courtrooms will have justice. Then The Bug and his ilk will find themselves up on the cross. He threatened us, you know. While we were keeping vigil outside the courthouse during Charlie's trial. He said, "We're gonna get you 'cause you sucked Charlie Manson's dick." I mean, blowjobs aren't even a capital offense. Actually, I think they are in matters of national security. Then The Bug had the audacity to accuse us of threatening him. He said he was going to send us to the gas chamber. He's the one with murder on his mind. I mean, look at us. Do we look like we would threaten anyone? You girls want to drop some acid? There is no wrong. Paul? Paul? Paaaul? Cease to exist. There is no wrong. Come to now. No sense makes sense. Whoa. Black-eyed susans. Teach me your secret language. But they can help us. Where are we going anyway? We're taking Paul to see Lawrence Merrick. What is it asshole day and no one told me? Sandy, all I'm saying is using murder as a means to an end is wrong. There is no wrong, Paul. There is. Trust me on this. You're trapped in the illusion. Oh, am I the one? You've bought into the ugliness. It's all you can see. Even when beauty is standing right in front of you. I know what you want, Paul. Oh, do you? Mm-hmm. You want to know about N. Dight. Lyn told me so. Do you know him? Who says it's a him? Do you know... her? You know, Charlie told us all about how things are in prison. He said there's a pecking order, a food chain. At the top are the prison gangs, the Aryan Brotherhood, the Mexican Mafia, the Black Guerrilla Family, and all the rest. At the very bottom, the worst of the worst that even the con artists and the rapists don't respect are child molesters and pedophiles. Now, only a little bit higher, but still the lowest of the low, are the snitches, inmates who rat out other prisoners to the guards. Do you know what happens to inmates when they're caught snitching? I suppose they're killed. Eventually, yes. But sometimes, a snitch has to be made an example of first. What happens is the other inmates wait for the opportune moment when the guards are looking the other way. They corner the snitch, and they slice the edges of his mouth with a homemade knife, a shank they call it. It's not a big cut, just a slice. Then they punch and kick him. They beat him to within an inch of his life. And as he clinches his mouth in pain, the cuts deepen and they spread all the way up to his ears, forever marking him as a two-faced liar. The British call it a Chelsea smile, but California prison inmates simply know it as the mark of the snitch. Anyhow, what was it that you wanted to know about N. Dight? What are you two talking about? Paul was just telling me how good he is at keeping secrets. Weren't you, Paul? Are you afraid of us, Paul. No. I mean, um... Can you believe how clean this acid is. I mean, like whoa. There's nothing to be scared of. I'm not scared. No? Then kiss me. If you're not scared, then why won't you kiss me? Because I'm old fashioned. Oh, are you now? You know, um, a lawyer for the defense told me he had a pretty memorable, um, threesome with the two of you. Oh yeah? What exactly did he say? It certainly levels the high to worry about getting stabbed while fucking the Manson ladies in the bunk house at Spahn Ranch. I've found the only satisfactory position is sitting upright, back to the wall, facing the door. He said it was interesting. And, um, which lawyer was it? You mean there was more than one. Who told you the story, Paul? You know, he would probably prefer I didn't tell. Mm, that's probably best. We're not exactly nice to snitches. You don't say? So I just saw The French Connection. Man, that movie's fucking fascist. So you have these two cops and they're staking this place out. And they're not doing anything. They're just sitting there watching, but in this voyeuristic creepy kind of way. Because everybody's a suspect. But dig, they're being watched too. And the whole movie's like this. And it made me think, maybe we're all voyeurs, and even when we're being watched we're, mm, watching back. Um. Uh, what was I talking about? How The French Connection is fascist. Right. So, they go into this bar and they start shaking down all these black people like, "You're a drug dealer. You're a drug dealer." But I mean everybody can't be drug dealers, right? And you're watching it and you start thinking, but right as your brain is about to put it all together, they throw this crazy car chase at you and then you completely forget about how you're being programmed to accept cops disregarding your civil rights. You're pretty articulate. Yeah, I mean, for a bum. What's so funny? Why are you laughing? You all right, Squeaky? Don't call me that. Why did you just call me that? You never call me that. You're scaring me, Lawrence. Usually it's the other way around? What? Nothing. I can't be here. I thought I could, but I can't. I just wanted you and Paul... But it's just... No. I can't do it. Nice to see you again, Lawrence. Hey. Wait up. Don't leave me alone with two assholes. I got a pretty high tolerance for weird, but these girls, they know how to test it. Do you think they're dangerous? Everything is love with them, man. Even death. Yeah. They're sexy though. I mean, I wasn't expecting that. They don't look sexy on TV. On TV they look like, you know... Dirty hippies. Yeah. Manson's people did kill. All right? Don't forget that for a second. But did you ever think it was something bigger than just Manson. I been working on this documentary about Charlie and his group for the past two years. The more people I talk to, the more people I find I haven't talked to. Charlie knew everybody in Hollywood and everybody knew Charlie. Nobody will admit to that now, but it doesn't make it any less true. Did you ever talk to a guy named N. Dight? Dight? Yeah, it's like light but with a D. Doesn't ring a bell? Anyone ever mention a Dight? The only person they mention is Charlie. Krassner, what are you looking for, huh? Second shooter on the grassy knoll? You think there was one. Oh, snitches get stitches. Yeah, I been hearing that one a lot lately. But I do think that there is something bigger going on here. Do you know what magic is? Spirituality? A sense of wonder about the world. A childlike view of-- Magic is misdirection. It's getting people to look at your right hand while your left one reaches behind your cape and puts the rabbit into your hat. Now, some people don't see any of that. They simply see the magic. They enjoy the show. But there are others who don't believe what their eyes tell them. Okay? They look beyond the smoke and the mirrors. And they think that if they can see the magician set up the rabbit, they can expose the secret behind the magic. But if everybody knows how the trick is done, there's no show. So you think there was a conspiracy? Manson's followers thought he was showing them they were being duped, that he was exposing where the rabbit came from, but in doing so he was just setting up another magic trick, one that was so convincing and so real, they didn't even know that it was just still part of the show. You dig what I'm saying, man? I do. These girls believe in magic, Krassner. They believe in the power of the occult, and I wouldn't advise getting too involved with them. It usually doesn't end well. You're involved with them. Trust me. I've had plenty of sleepless nights when I wish I weren't. Oh, it's you. God. Long time, no see. How have you been? No, not that one. That one's not right either. Is she okay? Lyn is a very sensitive girl, Paul. We all are. People think we're impervious to all the nasty threats they shout at us on the corner, but we're still human beings. We have thoughts and emotions. We have needs. I knew I'd find you. You weren't gone. You were just lost. Light this. What is it? It's a magic herb christened in the blood of Sharon Tate, made to infuse your mind and make you want to kill. It's a joint, and I'm tripping too hard to remember where I put the matches. I can't find anything. Oh no. They're all scary. Look at his face. He's so scary. I know. I know. How long are you girls planning on sitting in front of the L.A. county courthouse? As long as it takes for Manson and the others to get out of jail. What do you do while you wait? You're there from sunrise to sundown. It's like a job. We talk to reporters and when they go away, we work on Charlie's vest. We've worked on it for years. It's the story of us, how Charlie found us and what we've done and learned. It has magic power. It can show you the past that you've tried to forget, things in the present you can't see, and the future, the destiny that awaits us all. Sometimes on the street corner we take turns wearing it, tripping on time. And sometimes we just sit there watching the grey people pass by. Grey people? Ordinary citizens going about their daily lives, oblivious to what's really going on around them. We'll be just sitting there and they'll be walking along just trying to avoid us. It's like watching a live movie in front of you. Sometimes, I just want to kill the grey people because that's the only way they'll ever experience the total now. I can't find it. Oh wait. This is it. What do you suppose that was about? You don't know much about women, do you Paul? No, I don't dance. But you do. Before the murders Tex Watson was in contact with a Navel Intelligence officer. N. Dight. First initial N, last name Dight. Everybody has all sorts of questions. Snitches get stitches. Like Light but with a D. The British call it a Chelsea smile. Isn't there something you wanted t o ask me, Paul? About the Naval Intelligence officer, N. Dight. It's like light, but with a D. Paul? Are you okay? Can I use your bathroom? Oh fuck me. Hmm. Come on Paul. Get yourself together. Yeah, Paul. Get yourself together. Lenny? Lenny Br-- Shhh. You'll get the cops here. But you're-- A comedic genius breaking down social barriers. A cultural prophet, lost before his time. Dead is the word I was going to say. Your act always was a little too on point. Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ? I thought you were Jewish. If you're gonna blaspheme, I think you should at least mean it. I gave up Judaism for Lent one year and stayed on the wagon after Easter. Now that's funny. A bit esoteric, but acceptable given the circumstances. Apocalyptic death cult girls. Now that I haven't seen before. Well, you know, you can only sow your wild oats for so long before it's time to settle down with a more stable kind of girl. That's funny too. You're a natural comedian, Paulie. I don't know what the hell your doing getting messed up in all this sh-- stuff. You can say "shit" now, Lenny. They can't arrest you when you're dead. One can't be too careful. You know, the frigging whoever is listening, right? Things have changed since... Yeah, since. We both had gigs the week John F. Kennedy died. Remember that? Of course I do. I didn't know what to do, dig. I mean how do you make people laugh after something like that. What was your opening line that night? I was performing for the Young Socialists League, so I said, "Aren't you sorry it was one of your nuts instead of one of theirs?" I, uh, I had a show at The Village a few days after. I remember the first thing I said was "Man, Vaughn Meader is screwed." Remember, because Meader's whole schtick was that Kennedy impression. I remember, Lenny. He really could cook with that. But I guess Meader outlived his time. Least I can say I didn't go down that road. Why are you here? Now see, I could ask you the same question. I mean, look at yourself. There was a time when you were making a living tipping over sacred cows. Now you're so serious. Trying to figure out what happened to the revolution. Who killed the 60s? You don't look like you're having much fun, Paul. Is that why you took too much? Hmm? You weren't having much fun either at the end. Maybe it wasn't about having fun. You ever think of that? How's your wife? How's your daughter? We're taking a break. She's had enough. She's finally had enough of you going off on your crusades to save the world. Ha! How dare you? How dare you throw judgement at me you dead fucking junkie? How's your daughter? Oh, yeah. That's right. Fucking fatherless. At least I'm still here. I might not be there, but I'm here. That's right. Justify your poor decisions by pointing at mine. You know what your problem is, you want the world but you don't want to change with it. No. You want to blame someone else for everything that's gone wrong in your life. It's my fault that your marriage fell apart. It's the CIA's fault you weren't able to stop the war. And it's Charlie Manson's fault for fucking whatever. I want a better world for my daughter. That's what the crusades are about. That's why I'm here. For her. But not there. With her. Yeah, that's one way to buck the system. That'll show 'em. Whoever they are. Fuck you, Lenny. For leaving your daughter. And me. You wanna know why I took too much, why I really did it. Because there's nothing sadder than an aging hipster. Lenny? My father always called me Lynny. You're fine. Everything is perfect. Come to now. Be with me. Put this on. No. No, no. It's too hot. No, it's perfect. It has powers. It is magic. It looks perfect on you. You're still afraid of me, aren't you? No. Should I be? Shh. Everything's fine. Just look at me. Just look at me. Paul? There are no justs. Squeaky? It didn't go off. Imagine that. What are you wearing? Destiny. Am I dead? Do you mean did I kill you and then myself and now we're trapped in eternity together? If so would that be such a bad thing? You're not dead, Paul. Have you ever had a lucid dream where your mind is aware while you sleep? Charlie taught us about them. This is like that. You can do whatever you want without any consequences. Lynny! Is that Manson? If only. That's Daddy. Growing up he gave me everything I wanted; clothes, dancing lessons, trips across the country. Nothing was too expensive for Daddy. Except love. The one thing I wanted most was the one thing Daddy couldn't afford. Do you know what we argued over the night I ran away? A word. We argued over the meaning of a word. As if words have meaning anyway. So you replaced one monster with another? Charlie never picked up anyone who wasn't already discarded by society. And I'll take a monster that loves me over one that doesn't. Forget Daddy. Lynny! Even in a dream, you're still afraid. You heard that, right? If kissing me would save me from the monster of my dreams, would you do it then? That is what you want, right? to save me. To un-brainwash me. To reveal who N. Dight is and un-brainwash the world. What if you're the one who's brainwashed, Paul? What then? If you can't kill something, and you can't make peace with it. Then the only you can do is live with it. Lynny! Come on. It's time to go. Where? Home. Paul? What happened? You passed out. I talked to you until you woke up. What did you tell me? Everything. Do you mind if I take a bath? It helps when I'm coming off acid. You can stay. I don't mind. You're welcome to join me. I'm good here. Suit yourself. What's the scar on your back? Didn't anyone ever teach you not to point out a girl's flaws? It's from a lung operation. I had breathing problems as a child. My mother told me I died twice, that both times the doctors came and told her I was dead. You don't remember? Who remembers when they die? I suppose that's why we have scars, to remind us death is always there. You girls don't seem to need much reminding. What I said earlier about killing the grey people? I didn't mean it literally. What did you mean? I was speaking from another dimension. Yeah. I know the feeling. You think we're bad, don't you? Are you? Can a girl named Sandra Good be anything but what her name says she is? Seriously, tell me what you think of us. I think you're trapped. I think the world has already decided what you are, and nothing that I or anyone else says will change that. If you go looking for evil, Paul, you'll find it. If you go looking for conspiracy, conspiracy will find you. Everything I've given up-- What my friends did they believed was necessary, so it was right. A war is coming, and when it does you'd better be ready because you'll-- We'll all have to go through changes. And if what needs to be done will be done, so be it. If that's what the world thinks I am and what Manson is, then I guess that's what I'll be. You all right? Mm-hmm. Do you have anymore of that acid? Yeah. Uh, two hits. Can I have one? It's for Charlie. Hunh. That's cool. Words... Fly... Fast. Charlie will know what it means. What are we gonna do with you, man? You show up here asking questions about some imaginary dude. You get Sandy all riled up, and Squeaky's freaking out. I thought no one called her that anymore. Only her friends. Why'd you come here. I don't know. I thought... I thought our generation was going to save the world. Problem is we didn't really know how to do that so we just protested and sang songs, took acid. We grew our hair out and said "Fuck the system." And we really though we could change it. Or I don't know. Maybe we thought it would change itself. And for a moment, it felt like we were in a new place. It felt like all the old ways were going to shift into something new. But after all the war, and the demonstrations, and the violence, it hasn't. The status quo just keeps on status quo-ing. You surf? No. I can barely stand on dry land, let alone a wooden plank in the middle of the ocean. I learned to surf before I learned to walk. It's just about finding the right break and waiting for a good wave. But some guys will just wait out there for the right barrel and they'll spend the day, just waiting. 'Til the sharks come and push them back into shore. I mean, I always take the first wave that feels right even if it doesn't look right. And sometimes I end up face down in the water, but sometimes I end up in that infinite pipe where everything is beautiful and perfect. But the wave always breaks. And the ride is always shorter than you think it's going to be. You can't wait for that perfect wave, Paul. Otherwise you'll just spend all that time out in the water and wait the day away, and if you stay out in the water long enough sharks are going to come get you. They always do. So just, uh, ride the wave that comes. And enjoy it while it lasts. What are you writing? A book. About us. Not about the murders or the trials just about the way we were. Before. Before what? There's nothing as sobering as realizing the moment that defined you has come and gone. One day, everything makes sense. Then suddenly you look around and you don't recognize anything. And you wonder "How did I end up here?" In all the things I saw myself becoming, I never envisioned being something that people were afraid of. Lyn. Lyn? Squeaky? I need your help. Of course. Anything. I need you to tell me who is N. Dight? I know you don't like snitches, but this is important. No, it's not that. It's just that-- What? N. Dight isn't a real name, Paul. It's a joke. You know, like to indict, like for a crime? Oh, fuck me. Why didn't you say anything earlier? You're supposed to be a comedian. I thought jokes were your thing. I need you to think back to when you were living with Charlie and with Tex Watson. I need you to think if there was anyone that Tex Watson would go visit, or maybe some strange guy who would come see Tex where you all living at the ranch. There were a lot of people who visited the ranch. When I talked to you on the phone, you acted like you recognized the name N. Dight. I know I did. But you knew it wasn't a real name. Of course not, what kind of name is N. Dight? So why did you act like you recognized it? Because you wouldn't have come otherwise. Everyone hates us, Paull. All our friends are in jail. People look at us and only see monsters. Well, that might be because you carved Xs on your forehead. That was a joke. Well it wasn't a very good one. Yeah, you're right. So what exactly happened in the bathroom? I just helped you through a bad trip. And the word that you and your father argued about before you ran away, what was it? That doesn't make any sense. Well, what do you expect from me? I'm crazy. Paul? Sorry. I'm sorry. You forgot your bag. Oh. Thanks. Thanks for having me over. Thanks for coming. And, um, if you write about us, be kind? Sure. I will. There was this guy who used to come by the ranch to see Tex. Charlie didn't like him. He thought he was a narc. Tex always vouched for him though. I can't remember the dude's name, but I think he lived in Venice. It's a place to start. I'll ask around. He's probably just some dude. There are no justs, Paul. Hey, wait a minute! So what do I do now? Do I go down the rabbit hole? Do I chase the paper trail and the whispers and the he said/she saids? Do I try to find out which dictator the mysterious redacted "they" want to put in charge? Ooo, who's it gonna be? Is it gonna be a Rockefeller or a Chase? A Bilderberger or a Freemason? Hell, maybe it'll be that crazy rich kid up in New York who's slapping his name on all that real estate. What is it? Trent? Troy? Trump. Trump...Trump. Trump. Yeah. Trump. Do you want to know why I don't actually want to hunt down the truth with a capital T? I'm afraid I might find it. I'm afraid that I'll find out that the real truth is that nobody is pulling the strings, ordering the hits, making the rich richer and the poor poorer. I mean, what if everybody even the rich, out of touch greed-mongers at the top are just winging it? I mean, what if they are just as lost and lonely as three cultists who no longer have a false god to follow. What will I do then? What will we as a people, a country, a world do? Because without a them? Who are we?
