Can I get you another? Yeah, I'll get another one, thanks. Coming right up. Ugh, they're almost done. Good, what's taking them so long? Something about insurance or whatever. Yeah, we should've handled that weeks ago. Yeah. Well, all I know is the captain's a real hoot. Is that a good thing or a bad thing? I don't know. Hope it's a good thing. Aw, you doing okay? Yeah, I'm okay. You know, you have us here, right? I promise. Girl, we have a whole week of fun with Captain Wally or whatever the hell his name is. We have sun, snorkeling, booze. Dude, we have our own boat. What more could a girl ask for? I know. I'm so grateful for you guys. If I had to stay at home one more day, I think I would've killed myself. Oh, girl, fuck that. No, that is over and done with. And I suggest you take this thing, put it away. And when we get home, you sell that son of a bitch. I can't do that, I gotta give it back. Sis, fuck him, he broke your heart. So you break the bank, okay? Put it away girl. You want me to sell it? I'll sell it. Don't leave it to me. Ladies, we sail into the sunset within hours. - Everything went smoothly? - Smooth enough. It was pretty amazing, if I do say so myself. - Will made an addition. - Oh. Addition? Just a little one. He got us the new Booze Cruise option. - Oh. - Yeah. - What's that? - I don't... No seriously, what's that? Some add on where the captain supplies us an entire bar while we're on the boat. Yeah, apparently Will still thinks we're all 21. Yeah, yeah, I'm still clinging to my youth over here, okay. Hey look, we're on vacation. We're here to have a good time. - I don't know, but... - With our good friend, Jessie. We needed some bottles to pop. Now we have some bottles to pop, so there you go. Hey, no complaints from me, Will. You spend away. It's gonna be amazing, I swear to God. Leave it up to him. I remember when I couldn't get you outta bed before noon. Now you're beating me out the door every morning. Morning, Dad. Going out for a surf? Yeah, I'm gonna catch some waves, see if I could spot some whales. They're having their calves right now. Oh. Be safe, Kiddo. Love you. So it's a five-day trip. Wally knows the route, everything's in line. I wanna make sure that you guys have the paperwork before we set sail. Thank you. Damn tourists. You can't say damn tourists because, well, you only been here three months. Look, this island has a economic generator and it is tourism. Mm-hmm. When I used to work at... It's been a week, Sheriff, since I buried what little they gave me to bury of my daughter, and not a single phone call telling me what you're doing about it. - Beth. - Harlan. Look, the part of me that might radiate a gentleman's missing today, I'm afraid. So I apologize for any choice words I may use. That's completely understandable. I'm so, so, so sorry. Thank you. Well? This conversation doesn't come easy, Harlan. Well, it shouldn't be easy. I know this is a very difficult time. You understand that, do you? You don't understand shit. And don't patronize me. A shark killed my baby and I want to know what the hell you're doing about it. Look, we live in a tourist destination. Do I look like a man that came in here to talk to the hired help today, let alone one that doesn't know his ass from his elbows around these islands? Are you writing my daughter off as just another statistic, Kula? Is that what you're fucking doing? No, I'm grieving with you. We are so sorry. You know, it's a tragic situation. Tragic. God, if I hear tragic one more time. Tragic is when your daughter dies in a car accident, or tragic is when your daughter dies from an overdose, from some bullshit. My daughter was eaten alive by a fucking fish. She was alone. That's not tragic, Sheriff, that's fucking horrifying. Look, I've been sport fishing these waters for years, I built a respectable business around it. I know these waters and there's something I've learned. I'm gonna let you in on a little secret. When a shark tastes something it likes, it doesn't leave. You know what I'm saying, Kula? I do understand what you're saying. We're doing the best we can, Harlan. We're doing everything we can. We have to answer to the City Council. - We gotta answer to the... - Fuck 'em. Fuck the city council, fuck the conservationists, fuck Animal Rights, fuck all those people. You've got a man-eater on your hands, Sheriff. And it's just a matter of time before he finds his next meal. You better hope it's not one of yours. If you don't want to do something about it, then I will. Beth. Harlan. Harlan! So that's the infamous captain everybody talks about? Yeah, that's him. I hate your shoe. I hate your shirt. I hate your beard. I hate your hat. I like your honesty, you wanna know why? 'Cause my wife makes me wear it. She says it's good for business. You wanna know the moral of the story? Don't get married. Take my advice. Okay, gee, thanks. And here's our wonderful captain. Hi. Well, okay, hi, how are you? I'm Wally. This is my hat, this is my Beth. Hi. Really good thing about Beth, is that she's strong, she eats well, so she can carry heavy stuff. - Hmm... okay. - So, give all your stuff to Beth. We're gonna head out to a small boat, gonna take us to a bigger boat, all right? All right. I got it. This is so good. All right, be careful. Thank you. So since when do groups do honeymoons anyways? Originally I just thought it was supposed to be the two of you? It was supposed to be the two of us, but sometimes things don't work out that way, so... Oh, I'm so sorry. Shit, sorry, that's a bad first impression of me. My name's Beth. Jessie. We're gonna make sure you see the sights and have some fun, all right? And this here's your captain and his father calls him Wallaford. Negative. Announcement. Unless you wanna get thrown off this boat, you do not call me Wallaford, thank you very much. Now we're gonna make sure you guys have as much fun as possible. That's exactly what she needs. Yeah, actually, um, is there an island here with just single men on it? Hey, what are we, just chopped liver? You know what? I do know a couple of islands like that actually, but they're filled with wrinkly, old men. Naked, wrinkly old men. Hey, since when you been to those beaches? Pass for me. So do we call you Captain? Ah, I suppose it's tradition, but nah. I mean, Wally will do just fine. A lot of these old sea captains get their egos bent outta shape, if you don't refer to 'em by their title, but shit, it's the new millennium, right? So you got your heart broken, huh? Yeah, you could say that. Yeah, it happened to me once. It heals. Don't worry, you'll find someone new. Yeah, that's what they keep telling me. So is, uh, Beth your wife? Yeah, you know, she keeps me in line from time to time, I guess. Look, it's none of my business, but you see the sea out there? It's got a way of making us stronger. It heals wounds and hardens hearts. Your friends make you do this? They did. They were trying to turn a shitty situation into something special. It was already paid for, so you know. - That's some good friends to have. - Yeah. It's often hard to find people to stick by you during turbulent waters right? Don't mind the pun. Um, I'm a sea captain. I take every chance I get. Jessie, do you like dolphins? - I do. - Okay. We're about to show you some. Okay. Let's go, everyone. Time to go. Ooh. Girl, what is that out there? I think that's a turtle. Oh, my gosh. This is just all so beautiful. Amazing. Thank you, Sunny. For what? For making me come on this. Oh, you thought I was gonna let you sit at home and sulk all by yourself. Mm-mmm. Girl, if you gonna sulk and be in a pity party, you better do it right here. Seriously though, thank you. No problem, you know you my girl. Hey, Wally, where are we headed? I'm gonna take you to a secret island. It's a small island with a reef, We're gonna anchor there for the night. It's a really beautiful spot and hardly anyone goes there. Oh. Is there dolphins there too? By the end of this trip, you're gonna be sick of the damn dolphins, trust me. Ay, see, that's my thing, he knows I wanna ride the dolphins. My thing. This right here. Okay. They do that out here, I heard. Based on the bite radius and the tear direction, can anyone identify what type of shark this is? No? How about this? That's a Carcharodon carcharias. That's right. Lights. Carcharodon carcharias, otherwise known as the great white. The most feared predator in the ocean, outside the orca. Which is also quite mysterious in its own right, correct? Correct. Yes. The orca is, but the, um... The species of the great white has evaded scientists for years. W... W... Why is that? Oh, many reasons. First of all, we don't quite understand their migratory or their breeding patterns. We don't understand why they travel thousands and thousands of miles over many different oceans and seas. We've actually never seen 'em mate. We don't know when they fully mature. We don't quite understand at times why they dive to such great depths. By the way, if there's deep water to be found, they're almost impossible to track. And why do they eat people? What makes 'em target people? Well, sometimes they mistake a human being for a food source. We're flesh and blood and bone. We are a food source. Well, that's true but they prefer fish and seals. Oh, a cheap hamburger or a 32-ounce rib eye. Which one would you rather have? No offense. I think that's all for today, class, if you'll excuse us, please. Harlan, I don't know what to say, I'm sorry. I... Thank you. It's been hard, Sam. You know, I lost my wife, but now losing my daughter... I mean, especially like this. What's this? Open it. I've been on the water most of my life, Sam, and I've seen a lot of sharks. But I've never seen anything that's done that. I thought maybe you could help me identify the kind of shark that did this. Wait a second here. I thought she was attacked on Kuina Beach. She was. Well, that's impossible. Why? Well, this ecosystem, it supports warm water fish. And you know all the big sharks that occupy this. Tigers. Tigers are the only sharks we have around here that attack people on occasion. But you are not saying that this was a tiger shark. They... These photos are... Well, they look more like a great white. Great whites don't come to these waters. It's not impossible. - It's not impossible. - No. A couple years back a research team outta Woods Hole tagged a great white female, they named it Lydia. She crisscrossed the Atlantic back and forth, after about 35, 40,000 miles, ended up in The Bahamas. Bahamas with tropical waters and warm water? - Yeah, yeah. - Hmm. There's a lot about the great whites we still don't understand. Sam, my daughter's body was found in pieces on the goddamn beach. Well, the majority of sharks, they kill for survival, for food, and they eat their kill. They don't leave it in pieces. So you're saying this thing's killing for sport. Yeah, so anyways, Brie couldn't even find her way back to the hotel. Yeah, and then... and then, she starts yelling at this German cab driver in English and then projectile vomits all over the guy. Yeah, it was in his hair, in his gear box, in the seats. Okay, thank you, that's enough, thank you. I'm sure he liked his stomach acid infused cologne. I've worn that scent a time or two. So you guys have all known each other for a while, huh? Quite a while, yeah. I've known Will and Sunny the longest. No me, she's known me. And I met Brie and Emma in college and Ty just... Just kinda drifted in with the tide. And he never left. And there are no couples here. Whoo, Captain Wally, right down to the nitty gritty, huh? Calm your hormones, Brie. The man is taken. - She's right here. - I'm just saying. I didn't mean anything by that, I'm just saying that mostly couples come down here, that's all. It's refreshing to see a group of friends who have just been that, you know? Friends. Well, actually, Sunny and Ty dated once. Shut your mouth. Okay, listen, it didn't go well. It's kinda gross, but it didn't. Listen, it didn't. I was the, uh, test bunny, Captain. You mean test dummy. What about you, Wally? Have you always been out here living the pirate life? Ah. If only, I wish I was a pirate. No, I grew up in Minnesota. Oh. Yeah, I worked in a garage, fixing motors, most of my young years. So what brought you down here? My cousin had a boatyard, I came down here one winter. And that was that. So how did you two meet? It was actually turtle mating season and a big guy thought I was like the flavor of the week and it kept chasing me while I was snorkeling in the water. And then big Wally came in there and he showed that turtle dominance. - That sounds kinky. - Oh. It definitely was not. So careers, change subject, what do y'all do? I just graduated. I'm gonna get this. Uh, pre-med? - How'd you know? - Got it. - What? - Well you have that doctor look about you. And? We're all open books here. This one also takes care of her mother. She's disabled. Oh, that's tough. - Will. - Hmm. Oh. Oh, well, I'm the sleaze of the group. Okay, okay. Club promoter? No, I'm a lawyer, litigation. Okay, cutthroat. Yeah, blood in the water all the time. Shut up, Will. No. It's not like that. What about you, Sunny? I work in real estate. There's nothing shiny about that. I know my name is Sunny, but it's not that shiny, you know. Yeah. I'm gonna grab some more wine. So what does tomorrow bring for us, Captain Wally? Okay, so tomorrow I'm gonna take you to that special island I was telling you about. It's got amazing beaches, some out-of-this-world snorkeling, gonna see turtles and dolphins. It's one of my favorite places here in the islands. - And most importantly... - Yes. ...not a lot of tourists know about it, 'cause it's just a little bit out of the way. Okay, well that sounds amazing. - It's magical. - Yeah. Harlan. Harlan! Harlan, what do you think you're doing? Going fishing, Sheriff. Fishing with a goddamn rifle? Well, everybody has their own way, Deputy Do-Right. That's illegal, Harlan. You're gonna stop me, Kula? - I didn't think so. - Let me get this straight, you're gonna go cruise all the islands, looking for the shark that killed Jen? That's not how you do it. Well, if you would have at least devised some kind of plan, maybe I'd have listened to you. But you sat on your ass and didn't seem to give a good government shit about the fact that there's a rogue shark out there. So I guess I'm gonna have to go out there and remind that goddamn fish exactly where he is on the fucking food chain. You guys wanna see some sharks? Oh, shit. Wait, for real? Where? What? Ahoy, hey, you assholes. See him throwing that line over? It's to attract sharks, which in these waters, is extremely illegal. Why the hell would you wanna bring sharks closer to the boat? Tourists, they pay big money for it. See that right there? Oh. It's a white tip reef shark. Whoa. It's actually smaller than I thought. Harmless, mostly. Should be more of that coming. There they are. So cool. And they don't bite? I mean they bite, but you're just not food for them. That, see that. Huh. There it is again, you see it? That's a small tiger shark. Now those are responsible for most of the attacks here, but still that's not so common. Well, still, it's a small fish. Oh, Will, are you trying to see like a really big, big fish, a shark, what? I mean, no, I mean, look, I've seen pictures, seen it on TV, and look, they're huge, yeah. Getting pretty big down here. I've seen one before, Will. When I was snorkeling in The Bahamas we had one cruising right through us. They're beautiful. Sometimes you get one that swims close to shore, but it's rare. How big do they get? I don't know, I've seen about a 15-footer. - Oh. - God damn. - Now that is a big fish. - Mmm. - They're a sight all right. - Yeah. Once they understand that there's food in the water, they can hang out for hours. Sometimes days. - Wow, it's beautiful. - Yeah. All right, here she is. - Yeah, wait 'til you get off the boat. - Gorgeous. The reef in front of us is protected and the water's too shallow for a boat this size to go on through. So, Beth, can you do me a favor? - Can you get the raft? - I can. Thank you very much. Island's all yours for the next 24 hours. Nothing but peace and quiet. Now on the backside of the island are some palapas with some fresh cots, if you wanna sleep inside. But if you want my advice and look at the stars at night, you want to go in front of the beach right there. Go, go ahead, go. Go get some towels and fresh blankets and pillows below deck. Enjoy yourselves. Oh, yeah. We are bringing more business. Honey, you wanna help me? Hey, Jessie. Ain't you glad you didn't bail on this now? - It's not like I really had a choice. - Yeah. Are you complaining? Not at all. Well, I think this is amazing. It's all of us together, turning a crap situation into... So what's your mom think about all this, Jess? - Brie. - What? I'm serious. Nobody's talking about this shit. For good reason. No, it's fine. It's all right. You know my mom's just as upset as me. She really liked Dave. Dave. That's his name. I'd forgotten it about it already. Whoa. - What was that? - Um... What was that? - Oh. - Oh, Jesus Christ. Okay. Did you guys see Brie's face? Okay, okay. Your face. How could we not? Guys, it's fine, dolphins are a good sign. Really, really? What do you mean? Why? How? How so? When dolphins are around it means there's no danger. - Okay. So you talked to the dolphin. - Good. - He's just protecting everything. Okay. - Yeah, that's right. Oh, good. Well, that's good. Good to know now. - Now I feel better. Good. - Yeah. Jessie, you copy? Jessie, you copy? Jessie, you copy? Yeah, this is Jessie. There's no cell coverage out here, no land line, so this is how we talk to one another between the boat and the island, okay? Copy? That's correct. Have Will row back and I'll get them on the raft with him. Okay, so you're not staying out here on the island with us tonight? Correct. Someone needs to stay with the boat at all times, but Beth and I can always be reached via the radio. Copy. Hey, Jess, what, are you moving in on the captain? He's kind of old for you, don't you think? - Shut up, Will. - Uh-huh. - No, it's not like that. - Right. He's got Beth. Well, he's a handsome man. Not Captain Ron, Captain Ahab, - well, I can see Captain Wally. - Shut it. So good for you, right. I got the beer. Thanks Beth, Wally. You guys are real gems out here on the high seas. Here you go guys, food, booze and the works. I got the beer. Okay. Shotgun. No, wait, that's not a... Oh. Shit. - Oh, shit. - Get inside. Sit down. Shit, bad move, pal, that's not what you wanna have happen out here. It's deep, but I still think I could wrap it. Beth, do me a favor, give me the first aid kit. Yeah. Listen to me. When you go ashore, you stay on the beach, you do not go in the water. Do you understand? Hey, look, so I can understand just a little bit more, why can't he go in the drink? We're an ecological marine system that thrives off of blood in the water. Okay? One drop of blood's going to attract small fish, it's gonna attract some even larger fish. I don't wanna freak you guys out. Just do me a favor and keep him out of the water, understand? There, that should hold. Look at me, keep it dry, understand? Yeah. Shit. Hey, Jack. Harlan, good to see you out and about, buddy. Well, it's good to see you too, Jack. How's the bite? Not so great. Harlan, what are you doing out here? Stupid question, sorry. Jack, you fish these waters even more than I do. Anything been going on out here the last week or so that I might not know about? Well, like I said, the bite's been bad, which is odd, you know. Hey, you know, I know you like to fish the shallows, but you're usually out there on the edge of the trench. What are you doing way the hell in here today? We hit a reef this morning. Can't believe you hit a reef. Yeah, check it out. Jesus. Looks like you've seen a ghost. What are you looking at? What's the matter? That wasn't no reef, Jack. Tell me exactly where this happened. When you're on your way out, you know where the edge is, where you take that swooping turn into the shallows, heading toward the point? - Toward the point. - Right there at the edge. -Right there -Right there. You ain't gonna make it out there before sunset. Not gonna happen. No, I don't reckon I will. Tomorrow's another day, my friend. - Good to see you, Jack. - Always good to see you buddy. Earl. All right. Jessie to Wally, over. There you go, you're getting the hang of it. How's it going out there? It's all good. Just doing some scrubbing here, that's all. Sorry for my friend. Yeah, that's okay. How's his hand doing anyway? Well, you did a good job bandaging that thing up. I mean, of course, I had to rewrap it, but I give you points for your effort. Well you're the doc. Never was really good at using medical supplies, usually just used duct tape and super glue. Spoken like a true sailor. Thanks again, Wally. Over and out. Good night, Jessie. So that girl's fond of you. Ah, she's hurting is all. We've been there before, Beth. - Shit. - Some captain, my love. Oh, no. Oh. Oh, God. Fuck. Only a few inches too short there. - Story of my life. - Oh. - Oh, my God. - You wouldn't wanna lose that. No, no, no. In you go. Fuck. Oh, look at you, congratulations. You need me to help you out? Wally! Wally, you need to come now! Shh. - Where are we going? - Shh, keep your voice down. - You're gonna wake the whole damn island. - Sorry. I'm gonna go for a swim. We can't do that when everyone's awake? Nope. Warm, isn't it? Yeah. It's like bath water. So why are we out here, Emma? You ask too many questions. Just enjoy the view. What? A girl can't enjoy herself in paradise? Oh, my... What? Nothing. Just water. Biggest tease in the world, Emma. I'll just wait. Damn it. Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Help! Help, help! Morning sunshine. Morning. Oh, aren't we on vacation? Aren't we supposed to be sleeping in or something? You know, I wanna explore the island a little bit. Oh, my God. Why must it be so bright? How's your head feeling, Brie? Two sizes too small. Yeah, I bet. All right, you know what? I'm gonna cook us breakfast. With what, Will? Watch this. We have a frying pan right here. And we have a fire pit right there. That's some Neanderthal shit right there, Will. Skill is what it is. Why don't we just go eat on the boat where there's an actual kitchen and curtains? Hey, Will, you got that radio that Wally gave us? Yep. Yeah. Here. Then whose is this? Hey, Will to the skipper. Maybe it fell overboard. I mean, maybe, but, I don't know, the captain just doesn't seem that... No, he wouldn't be that irresponsible. Right. Yeah, well, we could all agree on that. All right, I tell you what. Why don't you three check out the beach, I'll take the raft back to the boat, see if the captain made off with another wench in the middle of the night. Or maybe he just hit the bottle a little too hard last night and is sleeping in. Like we should be. - Good? - Yeah. Sound good? Sound good? - Yeah. - Okay. Wait, did we lose Ty and Emma? Oh, looks like someone went out to play a little game of hide the sausage. - You nasty, bro. - I'm just saying. Okay, you know what? I'm gonna go look for them as well. You wanna come? Oh, yeah, and catch them two in the act? I'm all for it. - Can I have it? Yeah? - Okay. Well, I'll just stay here then. You took one bite, 'cause you weren't looking for something to eat, you were looking for something to kill. Skipper. I swear to God, if you've been hiding some girls on that boat, we're gonna have to have a talk. Where are all the damn dolphins? Captain? Where do you think they are? Curled up under one of the palm trees, probably. Can't get mad at them for wanting some privacy. Yeah, you're right. Are you doing okay, Jess? What do you mean? Well, I know we kinda just invited ourselves onto this thing and forced you to come with us. We just wanted to cheer you up. I know, thank you. I appreciate you guys, I really do, thank you. As long as my girl is having fun. What? Life is short. We only get one crack at this bitch and then bam, it's over. You're right. That's one way of looking at it. Right. No way. Wait, wait. Wait, are they running around here naked somewhere? Will was right. Hiding the sausage is the game of the day. Oh, my God. - I mean. - Wow. Whoo. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, Sunny help me. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh. Oh, God. Oh, oh. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. No pulse. -No pulse -Oh, my god. - There's no pulse. - Oh, my God. Sunny, I need you to go and get Captain Wally and Will, right now. - Where's Emma? - Sunny, now. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I don't want to be out here right now. Will, hurry up! Oh, my God. Jessie! Ty! They're dead. Oh, my God. We need help. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God. We need help. - What happened? - No, you don't understand, - we need help. - What's happening? I came here for Will. Will, Will, come here, please! Will, please! Will! This is so bad. We need Will. Please, come on. Help me get him, please. Will. Will. Will, row, row! Will! - Row! - Hurry up! - Will! Will, row! - Hurry up! Oh, my God. Will, hurry, please. He's over there, Will. Oh, my God. What are we gonna do, what are we gonna do? We're gonna die. - Will. - Will, freaking swim! Oh, my God. Will. Oh, oh, oh. Will! - Oh, my God. - Will. - What are you... - You take the other end of that. When I have him, pull like your life depends on it. No, no, no. No, Brie. You can't go in there. No. Will! - Will! - Sunny, get it together! Pull when I have him! Okay. - Okay, wait. - Okay. Oh, God, I can't, I can't. - Pull now! - Hurry. - Sunny, pull! - Brie! Pull! Will! Will! Will! Sunny! I think I broke my leg. Okay. I need to turn you over. You're gonna have to let me help you, okay? How bad is it? It's bad. Can you patch me up? Of course I can. It's okay, honey, it's okay. I'm gonna be right back. Stay awake, okay? Yeah, yeah. Okay. I'm waiting. Okay. It's okay, honey. Okay. - Here, open up. - Uh-huh. I'm gonna try and stop the bleeding. Do what you have to. Why don't you give me some of this so we can stop the pain. I can't do that. - Alcohol's gonna thin your blood. - Right. You'll be safe, Will. I just have to get your belt, I need to get your belt, okay? This is gonna hurt, okay? And stay looking at me. Okay, you ready? One, two, three. It's okay, it's okay. You did good, you did good. Please stay with me, look at me, okay? - Mm-hmm. - Okay. I need you to do this one more time. Stay with me, Will. Stay with me. Look at me. - Okay, okay. - Okay, yeah. Okay, one more time. I'm gonna pour some of this on you, okay? Ready? Oh. I'm gonna die here, aren't I? - I'm gonna die. - You're not gonna die here. - I'm gonna die. - No, you're not, Will. Look at me. You're not gonna die here. Look at me, you're not gonna die. Look at me. You'll be fine, you're not gonna die. Stay with me, okay? Stay with me. - Okay? - Okay. That was... That was a big fucking fish. Oh, yeah. Hello? Can anyone hear me? Please, can anyone hear me? Hello? Can anyone hear me? We're stuck on an island, I'm not sure the exact location. Please, if anyone can hear me. Please, if anyone can hear me. I can hear you, but you're breaking up. Where are you? Hello? Hello? We are stuck on an island. I can hear an engine. I don't know the exact location. There's a catamaran. It's outside of the reef. Please, if you can hear me, please. All right, I can hear you, but I can't find you. The tide's getting low. I'm not gonna be able to get around these reefs if I take a wrong turn, so you gotta help me out. Where are you? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I'm, um... There... I don't know the exact location. We're outside of inside the reef. There's... There's a boat just on the outside. Please. Okay your signal's getting stronger, so I know I'm close to you. Pop a flare if you have one. Wait. I see you, kid. I'm coming. Pop me another one in about 30 seconds. You all right, kid? You're not hurt? I'm assuming that that fish is the reason you're stranded on this beach. Will tried to get out to the boat. It just kept attacking the raft. I've never seen anything like that. There's a girl floating out there. That's my friend. Is this your friend too? It's that fucking monster, did this. It's not a monster, it's the devil. Devils don't bleed, it's just a fish. You the only survivor? Yeah, I think so. So it was just you and these two? No, there were seven of us. Seven? I think I'm the only one alive. Okay. I'm gonna get on the radio and I'm gonna call the coast guard, they'll come get you, take you back to the harbor. I'd take you on my boat but I don't know if it can take much more from that thing. This is civilian charter, the USCG. I have any guard on this line? I repeat, civilian charter in need of medical care. Is there any coast guard on this channel? Coast guard vessel, Richmond Lee, go ahead. I'm in Mokulua Island, about two miles off the Southwest side of Dorsey Point. I need urgent medical attention immediately. Copy. What is the nature of the emergency? There's been a shark attack. Copy you. Emergency services are en route, please leave all channels open. Copy that. Mister, what were you doing out here? My name's Harlan. What's your name? Jessie. Well, Jessie, that fish out there, I believe it killed my daughter. So I came out here to find it and rid the world of it. Well, it seems that shark killed all of my friends. So if you don't mind, Sir, before I go home, I'd like to see that thing fucking dead. Okay, kid. So he circles around the perimeter and then comes back to the center. And that's where he goes down. Right. My guess is, he can't get out of this bay because of the low tide. Can't get over that reef. And when he goes under there in the center, that has to mean some dip in the sand there, a trough or something, where he can get some depth. All I need is just one good, clean, shot, close range. If I can get him in the brain, or better yet, in the gills. So we need him to smile at us. No, this fish, he's a special one. He's not hunting for food, he's shown you that. He's... He's playing, like a cat plays with a mouse. So we need to give it something to hunt. This island made you crazy, Jessie. You said that it dips right here and then it goes down before it gets to the dip, right? Yeah. So we need him to swim across there to make a straight attack. Yeah. That's what we need. So that's where we kill him. That's the kill hole. That's it? Do you think you can wear him down? You mean bleed him out? Yeah. Maybe, but if he takes a couple more shots at my old boat, I don't know if she's gonna handle much more. I can get him to come straight to you. Just need to position yourself on the channel. Just don't miss. You okay? This is gonna sting a little bit, you shithead. Swim, girl, swim. Jessie. Jessie. Jessie, where are you kid? I thought I lost you. Come on. Yeah. Some vacation, huh? It was supposed to be my honeymoon. I'm sorry about that. My daddy used to say, "If you feel like you need a drink, you probably shouldn't have one." We're gonna make an exception today. You did good. Jessie, we've called your uncle. He can't get here 'til tomorrow morning. We can get you a hotel room if you'd like. Did you get a hold of my mom? Yes we did. Is she okay? She's fine. There are some people that we could call. If you would like to talk to somebody. Nonsense. She just needs some good company and a good meal. My daughter, she liked blueberry pancakes. You like blueberry pancakes? I do like blueberry pancakes. Let's get outta this cop shop and get some blueberry pancakes. You know, Harlan... Hey, you remember what happened the last time you led with that, right? Hey, Harlan. Long time no talk, Sam. Yeah. Who the hell is this then? Oh, this is Peter. Harlan, you think we'd have a little chat with you? Well, for you, Sam, I'll give you a few minutes. Sam, you know I'm not a big fan of unfamiliar faces. Yeah, I know that Harlan, and I apologize. But, well, I think you should hear this man's story. He's not a reporter, is he? No, I wouldn't do that to you. You know that. Okay. A friend of mine recently told me about your exploits. And he advised me that I might be able to seek your help. My help? Well now you are a bit of a legend. Is that so? My family and I own a small business in Southeast Asia, in the islands, a vacation getaway to be exact. And recently business has plummeted. And... Harlan, his son was killed by a shark. My condolences. And I empathize with you but how does this concern me? Two other tourists were vacationing at our property. They were also killed. I believe all three of them were killed by a shark. What are the local authorities doing about it? Well, they sent a group of fishermen out. A few days later, no sign of anything. Boat was sunk, never found any bodies. Okay, so let me get this straight. You want me to kill another big fish in a part of the world that I never really wanted to go back to? That's why you're here today? Quite frankly, yes. We live on such a remote part of the island, nobody's gonna help us. And the locals are now talking about whatever's in those waters, is a spirit coming back for vengeance. Well, that's just fucking stupid. This was the last place that I saw my daughter alive, right here. How old was your son? He was 10. And you say this fish took down a boat? Yes, Sir. We're gonna need a bigger one.
