No. I, um... I love you. I'm in love with you, Taiga-san. I'm off. Stay safe. Say... Why is that my best friend has been spinning and spinning this whole time? How should I know? But halfway through the workshop he got so fired up it creeped me out. Arisugawa-san keeps throwing things at him. Maybe that's why. That director really throws stuff? That's terrifying! Oh. He's smiling. I'm so happy. My acting studies are fun... He talked. Getting hit that much is fun? Taiga-kun, are you a masochist? He is. He's happy when people are angry with him. The perfect acting-masochist. And, more than anything else... ...I've got someone amazing who'll look at me, only at me! You can't mean... - Not Shiori-san, right? - Onii-san... What are all you unpopular actors doing together? - Now look, I am popular... - Taiga. Today, just now, Shiori-san came to the parents' meeting at the school...The pheromones enveloping her... ...they've been amplified again. They're... ...just floating... - You couldn't have. Right? - Aniki... What? I'm sorry, Aniki. I... I don't know how to explain this to you, but... If I dared to say, then... Kitamura-san and I... ...we've declared our love for each other. Love... Oh my God! I'm sorry. I feel bad for what this means for you, Aniki. - Please, give us your blessing... - How could I? How could I give you my blessing? For Shiori-san and an out-of-work actor like you to be together, I'm too jeal... It's too reckless. Do you really understand? You and she are completely different... She's beautiful and respectable... She carries her painful past with her as she tries to raise her daughter, Umi-chan... No. I know. That's why... ...I'm really thinking hard about this. What? Thinking about what? Well, about... ...marriage and stuff. Marriage? Taiga... and marriage? I don't mean now. I don't mean any time soon, but... If you're seriously going out with someone, you have to think about this stuff, right? You're serious? Yeah. I'm serious. - Please come in. - I'm sorry to bother you so late. Not at all. What's this? Aoki-san? Please. So. What was it you wanted to talk to me about? Well, you see... The "Edo Blooming: Ginjirou of the Wind" series will be put back into production again next year. What? Already? This is... Who? Who's going to play Ginjirou? The second Ginjirou... ...will be played by Takami Makoto. What? Takami Makoto-san? That's amazing! Someone that big is going to play him? Yes. It seemed he liked Koutarou-san's Ginjirou. I heard from the producer that he said yes right away. - Wow. - Really? It's such a wonderful thing to be able to see Ginjirou again, isn't it? I'm certain that Koutarou-san is happy about this too. Yes. I'm sure he is. I must go tell Koutarou-san. Okay... Life is like the wind... Living and dying are as the wind blows... capricious and unpredictable... I want to be a cool actor, like my dad. Then I'll beat up all the bad guys! Living and dying are as the wind blows... capricious and unpredictable... Did something happen? No. I just... I wanted to hear your voice. Earlier... Aoki-san came to see my mom. Shachou did? Have you heard? ...about "Ginjirou of the Wind"... Yes. A little. Oh. You have... Are you okay? Yeah. The truth is... ...I always thought people would laugh and call me stupid... ...so I've never told anyone, but... Hm? No. Never mind. What is it? Tell me. After my dad died... ...I thought... ...I thought that... ...it would be nice if one day I could play Ginjirou. It's just something I thought... That's hilarious, right? I was just kidding. I know that it's completely impossible... It's such a popular series, there's no way someone like me would be on it. But... I guess you could call it a dream... Honestly. What am I talking about? I'm not laughing. I won't laugh. Thank you. Well... For now, I... ...I just have to move forward, right? Yeah. That's right. Taiga-san, do you like your tamago-yaki sweet or savory? Tamago-yaki? Well, when I make it I use salt and pepper... What? Salt and pepper? Well, because it's weird for it to be sweet when it's a side-dish, right? But if you add soy sauce the color looks bad, so I don't like that either. That's why, if I were making it, I'd probably use salt and pepper. Huh? But why... No reason. It's just that Umi's taking an obentou for lunch tomorrow at day-care... I was just thinking I'd make some for you too, Taiga-san... What? You have the workshop tomorrow too, right? That's why... I'll eat it! I want it. I do. But we make our tamago-yaki very sweet. Oh, that's fine. Totally fine. Sweet is fine. I'd like to try it. But... If you don't like it, you'll probably complain again... No. I won't. I won't say anything. In that case... I'll leave it in the fridge at the agency. Okay. This is crazy... Somehow I feel lots better. What? I have so much energy I don't think I can sleep. You have to get to bed. You still have 2 more days, right? Yeah. Then... Good night. Good night. See you tomorrow. Yes. See you tomorrow. Bye. Bye. Ow! Ow, ow, ow... Keita! Come on! Let's play Etude! What? What're you doing? People are sleeping here... - Let's play Etude. - Huh? Okay. Let's play Etude. Irabu-kun... 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, I am always an actor. - You're amazing. - Then I'm playing too. I'm an actor too. Okay. Let's play. Okay. - What's our theme? - Um... School? - School? - Okay, school. First is rock, jan ken poi! - And again... - What's that? First is rock, jan ken poi!

Here you go. Thank you, Kitamura-san. I needed this. You've saved me. What? They haven't interviewed you yet? The new actor before me got pushed, so I've been pushed 15 minutes. This novel is being made into a movie. I wish I could be in it. [Back to the Beginning] This heroine would suit me perfectly. Want to read it? I finished it. Oh. Yes. Um... Sakura-san... May I have a moment? Hm? Since you were honest and told me, Sakura-san... ...I want to tell you honestly too, but... You see... No. What? "I've fallen in love with Kusunoki Taiga-san too." "So please, don't chase after him any more." That's what you wanted to say, isn't it? No. Not like that... I wasn't going to ask you to give up loving him... Well, I won't. How can I? It isn't that simple... Sakura-san! I'm sorry... I didn't want to admit that I was in love with Taiga-san. I tried to forget... but... I couldn't. Why? Why did it have to be him? You're right. Why is it him... He's got no work, no money... You can't depend on him at all... But he's kind... Yes. Kind. And so serious... He's so serious it makes him clumsy. It's like he's so awkward you just can't leave him on his own. That's right. But I think he's quite masculine... ...except, maybe it's because he's so "pop culture," he doesn't know how the world works... Right? But I just can't hate him... ...even though it drives me crazy, it's sort of cute too... That's right! It's definitely a little cute... And everything he thinks shows on his face... That's right! Even though he's an actor... Right! Even though he's an actor, he's terrible at lying... But still... Is this any time to be laughing? Miyase-san! Sorry to have kept you waiting. Oh. Coming! Darn it. I wanted to have a real talk with you... Say, Kitamura-san? What if we go out for drinks sometimes... and take our time talking about romance and stuff... Yes. I'd love to... Oh, but I can't go for drinks... What about lunch? Then, next time it'll be lunch. Yes. Good luck! There it is... - Taiga-san... - Kitamura-san. Thanks for the obentou. You're welcome. Hang on. We shouldn't... We shouldn't act overly familiar at work, right? Oh. Right... Then... I'll be going. Stay safe. This can't be true... Who'd have thought that Taiga and Kitamura-san would... What? I'm back! Is something wrong? No! I'm fine. It's fine... Synchronize with your partners! Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop! What is this overacting in your sword-fighting? Ow! Ow... Don't try to be good at this. Don't try to act... Don't try to make yourself look good! All you can do is try to be present here. Just exist! What more can you do? Moron. Continue. Okay, continue, everyone! Yes, sir. - Jan ken poi! - Bye, Sensei! - Bye! Oh, Taro! - Huh? Your entry for our "My Dreams for the Future" book is due by the end of the week. Don't forget. I... will not forget. Okay... - Kusunoki-sensei? - Hm? What was your dream for your future? Let's see, I wanted to become a government off... ...um... a school-teacher. - Really? - Yes. Then your dream came true, didn't it? I guess so. See, my little brother kept saying "I wanna be an actor." Everyday, he'd play at "Ginjirou of the Wind" with my dad. It actually turned me off to it, made me want something more stable. So Taiga's dream was to become an actor... That's right. Hey, Nozaki-sensei, what about you? Me? Mine was... ...to be a beautiful bride. What? A bride? She said, "a bride"! Don't laugh at me... So, you've thought about that sort of thing, have you? A bride, huh? This looks delicious! Now then... Itadakimasu. It's sweet... It's delicious... We'll be having our "Sunflower Festival" this year too. Please take the flyer we're handing out home with you, okay? Okay. Sunflower Festival? We hold it every Fall. We'd like everyone's moms and dads to help, so we're counting on you, okay? Okay. What are you saying? I'm telling you, I didn't do it! Please. Believe me! I know it's him! He's the murderer! - What are you saying? - You're the one that was there... You're the ones who couldn't get along with him! Idiots! All of you... In all this time, what have you learned? Today is the last day! Show me more of who you are. Show me who you are! Morons! Yes, sir. - From the top! - Yes, sir. Starting tomorrow, it's part-time work for me, huh? If I start in the morning, and work a full shift... that's 8 hours, right? Which means... hourly wage is 800 yen, so 1 week... Seems like it's gonna get busy... What? It's just, starting tomorrow morning, I have rehearsals for a movie. You really are despicable. But, well... - I've really learned a lot. - What? I mean... I've started to figure out what I'm bad at, and... I've learned that there are so many actors out there who are better than me... ...and that all of them are trying desperately to succeed. You've finally realized that? At your age... Yeah. Thanks for inviting me. Well. Today this workshop comes to a close. You've all worked very hard. - Good work everyone. - Thank you. Now, the 3 people who's names we call... ...will participate in the rehearsals for our 17th production starting next week. The 17th production is "Hamlet," right? They're picking 3 of us? That's a lot... - Nakamura-kun! - Yes, sir! Ochiai-kun. Yes, sir! Fuchino... Kusunoki-kun! What? Will those three please change clothes and report to me. Everyone, very good work. You're dismissed. Thank you. This can't be true... This is great! This is great! Why him? He wasn't any good at all... Apparently, he's a 2nd generation actor. Kusunoki Koutarou's son. Oh. So that's what's going on. I see. It must be nice to be a person with connections like that. Everyone, gather up. Everyone, back in line! Yes, sir. Every single one of us has special traits. There are tall people... ...short people... ...people with big eyes... Some people have big noses or high voices... ...and, well... there are even some people with naturally curly hair. And if there are some people with lots and lots of money... ...there are others who are poor. Listen, everyone... As an actor... ...all of these things can be both strengths and weaknesses. It is true... ...that I picked him... ...because he is Kusunoki Koutarou-san's son. And what of it? That's one of his strengths. It's true that his acting... ...contains not even the slightest shadow of Koutarou-san. But I felt that this very difference in ability was interesting. Interesting. That's all. All right! That's all. I just can't agree with the way things turned out. It's just like Arisugawa-san said, right? It's because you fail to see your own shortcomings... ...and are jealous of others, that no matter how much time passes, you'll always be 3rd rate. Or something. I was probably the most jealous. Arisugawa-san! I... Your father... His facial expressions were subtle, but... ...inside, he was passionate. Don't be too happy. I just wanted to bully you a little longer. That's all. Thank you very much! Aoki-san! I made it. I made it! - Really, Taiga? - Yeah. I'm in rehearsals for the new play from next week. I don't know whether or not I'll get a part though. That's amazing! Being able to be part of that company... Congratulations, Taiga. Thank you. Thank you so much! Congratulations! We did have a bunch of variety work set up for you though. Congratulations. Thank you. Congratulations. Thank you. Oh. Hatoma-san. Sushi. Let's order sushi. I never thought I'd be picked. I just worked as hard as I could... I did all kinds of preparation, but it all just sort of... blew away. For now... I'm really looking forward to rehearsals starting. Taiga-san, you seem like you're having lots of fun. Huh? You know, before, when I watched the DVD Koutarou-san sent me... ...I thought, "he really looks like acting is painful for him." Really? Is that what I looked like? Yeah. But now you look like you're having fun. Like... You have this feeling of freedom to you. Really... I'm looking forward to your stage performance too, Taiga-san. - Is it time? - Yes. Today was her friend Hina-chan's birthday party. Yesterday we went to buy her a present together. Well, I'm off to go pick her up. Okay. Well then... Okay... Hello. - Hey. It's Taiga! - Hey, Umi. - Please, come in. - Thanks. - Here. - Thank you. Come in. Come in. It'll be ready soon, okay? Sure. I haven't been here in a while... It's true. Sweet tamago-yaki is good too. I'm so glad. Oh. Thank you for the obentou the other day. It was really delicious. I love Mama's cooking too. Umi-san. Make sure you eat your broccoli too. Okay. - Sunflower Festival? - Yes. Wow. They do these kinds of events at the day care? Yes. They do all sorts of things based on the seasons. - Are you going, Kitamura-san? - Of course. I'm really excited. I'll be making yakisoba. They said they invited the teachers, so Kusunoki-sensei may be there too. - Aniki? - Yes. Taiga, you come too. Yeah. Maybe I will. It seems like fun. Oh, it's okay. You just stay there. But you cooked and everything... - Don't worry about it. - No, but... Okay. I'll just stay here. Sure. Why don't you play with Umi? Right, Umi? Sure. What will we play with? What do you want to do? This? Okay. There you are. Hm? Umi, did you draw this? Yeah. It's a picture of Papa. I drew a picture of Papa on Father's Day. Sensei said I could draw a picture of Mama, but... ...I really wanted to draw a picture of Papa... ...so I looked at a picture and drew it. Wow... Because, you see... my papa is really, really cool. He's good at English and he's tall... He's really cool. That's why I'm a very lucky child. Really... That amazing... Now, Umi, put your pictures away... You're playing with Taiga-san, right? Right. What's wrong? I'm sorry. It's just... Your pictures are so good... I'm really moved by them. They're happy tears? That's right. They're happy tears. Then I'll draw your picture for you, Taiga. What? Really? Are you sure? Oh, it's Hina-chan's mama. - A friend? - Yes. We're "mom-friends." I think it's probably about the Sunflower Festival. I'm going to take this. Hello? Good evening. Thank you for having Umi over yesterday. Huh... Mom-friends, huh? Taiga, don't move. Okay. Yes. Okay. Thank you so much. Good-bye. Getting ready in time is going to be tough. Busy, busy, busy... I'm so sorry. I got caught up in conversation... What's this? - Mama? - Hm? Taiga-san's a grown-up, but he's already asleep. Oh... He came even though he must be so tired... - I'm going to the bathroom. - Okay. So this is what he looks like when he's sleeping... Oh! Oh, no. I fell asleep. Huh? Where's Umi? Bathroom. Oh. I'm sorry. I just... Watching Umi work so seriously on her drawing, I got sleepy... I do that sometimes too. I'll make some coffee. Thank you. I dozed off in someone else's house... I'm sure you must be tired. And... ...were you, maybe, trying to be considerate? What? Earlier... Are you okay? That's not what it was...earlier... I started thinking about your husband. I mean, Umi is... ...she's super cute, right? Drawing that picture... ...saying, "I love Papa"... It's a little bit... irresistible. She never once met her Papa, right? I just thought she must have wanted to... I was thinking your husband... ...must really have wanted to see her too. To see her... ...and to hold her in his arms. That's what I was thinking. I'm sure of it. Here I go again... Oh. Oh, no. I'm doing it too... Thank you. Thank you... ...for crying for him and Umi. - Huh? - Hm? What's wrong? Why are the two of you crying? We're not crying. Come here, Umi. There we go... I'm a little sleepy now too. Hm? Isn't that because you're full? - You drew this really well, didn't you? - Yup. I'll give this to you, Taiga. Thank you. [Sunflower Festival] - There's a lot of people here... - Hey. - Aren't we super out of place here? - Yes, we are. I'm not good with kids to begin with... I came because you said there'd be a lot of young people around, but this... ...this is too young. - Come on. Let's go. - What? See? We totally stick out. - We're fine. - I hate having kids stare at me... Hey! Aren't you Mary Ueno's son? - What? - It is! I've seen him on TV! Huh? What? - He's so cool! - Cool? Seriously? Really? Hey, Taiga. Kids are awesome, aren't they? What? Taiga! Umi! Up we go... That's a cute apron you're wearing. Yeah. Mama made it. Taiga-san! Hello. Hello. You seem pretty busy. A lot of parents ended up not being able to come. We don't have enough hands. Can I help? - Are you sure? - Yeah. Taiga! Perfect timing. Help me out over here. Okay. I'll see you later. Okay. Come here, Umi. Shall we go? Here you are. Thanks for waiting. Welcome! Yakisoba! Just 2 tickets! One please. - There we go. - Okay! - Taro, bring it on. - Good luck! That's amazing! All right! - Excuse me. - Yes? May I have a picture with you? Okay. Say cheese... - You're in the way! - What? - I'll carry that. - I'm fine. It's fine. Honestly... There you go. Sora-kun, you're amazing. Here. I'm giving it to you, Umi. Are you sure? I'm transferring to a different school. My parents divorced. I'll be moving soon. Say, Umi-chan-mama... We were just wondering... Is this... ...Umi-chan's new father? What? He is, isn't he? I knew it. He came to the Parents' Day too, after all... And he was cheering Umi-chan on during the swimming classes too. You seem to get along so well together. - Oh. No... - Right? No. I'm just... Oh... - He's my little brother. - Aniki... He's an actor, but he never gets work so he has a lot of free time. I have him help out sometimes. - Oh. Really? - See? I told you it wasn't like that. I thought he was too young. Well, it's true. He doesn't really feel like a "papa." Right? That's it exactly... He really doesn't have a single thing to be proud of... He doesn't have a stable job like I do, and he has no savings... As a person he's still very immature... He is far too inadequate... to support someone else. Hey. You don't have to go that far... But, you know... ...falling, in spite of all that... ...that's... love, isn't it? What? Love? Right? Okay then. I'll tell you honestly. My little brother, Kusunoki Taiga-kun, here... ...has his affections set on Kitamura Shiori-san. Kusunoki-sensei! - Why are you telling them all that? - What? Am I wrong? No... It's true. Right? I don't know what you're going to do from here, but... ...if you two overcome all the adversities you face, and decide to entwine your lives... ...then all I can do is wish you the best, right? Aniki... So. He's a worthless little brother, but... ...to me, he's my precious baby brother. So, without trying to hurry things along... won't you please watch over him with kind eyes? Wow! That's beautiful... Of course. We're behind you all the way. Thank you. - We'd better get going. - Oh. You're right. Well, if you'll excuse us. I don't quite understand what happened, but... You're amazing, Onii-san. Being called "onii-san" by Shiori-san... ...that's not bad either. Huh? Kusunoki-sensei! Will you help me? Of course! That's great, isn't it, Taiga? Everyone's rooting for you. Yeah. Just like always... It's not like that. Say, Umi... Umi-chan! It's nothing. Go on. Umi! The water's ready. It's time to take a bath. Okay. [I love Papa] Okay, everyone! Listen up for a minute. These three will be joining rehearsals starting today. Looking forward to working with you! - Sensei. They're here. - And you... - You need to think more about what you're doing there. - Yes, sir. Anyway, I have no intention of giving up on Senpai. You know, there was one time I pushed him to kiss me. And it felt like he almost gave in. He ran at the last second, saying something about his "virtue"... Really? His virtue? That's just like Taiga-san. So, if you ever let down your guard, Kitamura-san... ...I'll take him away. After all, the only one who can rescue him is his senpai in the performing arts world, me, right? I'm envious of that confidence of yours, Sakura-san. For a long time, it's been all I could do to protect what's important and close to me... My life together with Umi. That was my only goal... And yet... But I have no intention of letting you have Taiga-san. I care very much about Taiga-san. What's this? Are you challenging me? Hello. Shachou? What? Really? I understand. I can be in that movie! That's great! He said an offer came in for me! Of course it did. I knew I was the only one for that role! That's wonderful, Sakura-san! - Congratulations! - Thank you! It really is wonderful... This might become her most successful character since she was in "The Traveler" with Koutarou-san... Taiga is working hard... ...and, with this, our agency is safe for a little while too. - That's right. - Excuse me. Excuse me. What? Takami-san? Wow. Has it been 2 years? We met at the after party for the Japanese National Film Festival. Do you remember? Of course I remember. You know, I drank a little too much at that after party... You know, so did I... Wow... He's really here... He dropped in out of the blue. He said that since he's going to be the 2nd Ginjirou, he wanted to pay his respects... - Seriously? He came to the agency just for that? - Yes. Kusunoki Taiga-kun. Yes, sir. Hello. It's a pleasure to meet you. Actually, this isn't the first time we've met. What? Koutarou-san did so much for me... So, once, when you were still very young, I went to your house. - My house? - Yes. You had a toy sword, and you were playing "samurai" with Koutarou-san. "When I grow up, I'm going to be Gin-san," you said. To tell the truth... Being the 2nd Ginjirou after Koutarou-san is a great responsibility. Even working at it, I'll never live up to my predecessor... ...so I'll be taking my own approach. I see... We'll be looking forward to what you do starting next year... Well... I'd better be going. I'll protect "Ginjirou of the Wind." Until the day that Kusunoki Taiga... ...can succeed me as the 3rd Ginjirou. Thank you... Thank you so much! I'll work hard. The 2nd Gin-san is really cool too. Although he'll never beat the original Gin-san. Say, Umi? After we get home, there's something I'd like to talk to you about. - Talk about? - Yes. Kitamura-san! Taiga-san... Perfect timing. I was about to call you. - Is something wrong? - No... I got my first paycheck from my part-time job... Here. I bought a present for Umi with it to celebrate. You didn't have to do that. It's nothing fancy or expensive. Please take it. Umi. Hey, Taiga... Hm? What is it? Taiga... ...are you going to marry Mama? What? Mama... are you going to be Taiga's bride? Is Taiga going to become my papa? Umi, it's not like that. You see... I think it would be nice if things turned out that way. I... ...want to marry Kitamura-san one day. I'm still not much, so it wouldn't be soon, but... ...one day I'd like to marry... ...and become Umi's father. I want to become a family with you, Kitamura-san. I'm thinking of talking to Aoki-san about it too. I... I'm thinking very hard about how to... I don't need a Papa! My only Papa is Papa. I hate you, Taiga. - Umi. - I hate you too, Mama! Umi... I hate everyone! - Umi! - Umi! Wait! Taiga-san, you stay here. This problem is between me and Umi. But... I wish you hadn't spoken so blithely of becoming Umi's father. Umi! Umi! Umi! Umi! [Taiga] [Final Episode] I'm sorry. I won't see Taiga-san any more. I know! I'll never forget. Do your best in the play. From your fan, Kitamura Shiori. Shiori...
