Mmm. check here Team Infiltration, what's the status on the inside? Just like you suspected, all of the security systems were destroyed. What about the diamond? It's gone. The case is broken. This is the B Team. We've arrived at the bottom of the emergency staircase. We will now head up. There's no need to talk low. Go up as if you're trying to corner him. Roger that. Okay, let's reevaluate our plan. No matter where he flies out from, our four jet streams will blow him all the way to Tsukishima River. Lastly, we'll scoop you out like a goldfish. I won't let you get away of all the days. Will the winds be in our favor? There's a possibility of him attacking with his card gun. His ammo is hard, but they're just cards. There's no way they're wind resistant. Spreading his cape into a kite and shooting cards... He acts all cool, but he's weak against the wind. Yeah... KID! KID! KID! KID! Inspector! There you are, KID. Everyone, get in position! Yes, sir! I've certainly taken the diamond. Who the heck is he? Operation Catch KID commence! Tank, start the turbines! KID's heading east! Teams 2 and 4, go with pattern B! We're going to capture him! Take that, KID! He's so surprised he can't take out his kite, eh!? He's 50m from Tsukishima River! Team Tsukishima River, start pulling! KID fired a gun! He fired a gun! KID used a real gun...? Yahoo! KID jacked a ship and is fleeing. He's heading up the Tsukishima River! What happened to the copters!? We didn't prepare any copters for this operation. KID used a real gun...? The coast guards and ships are ready! Out of the way! Why are you spreading out the net here!? We can't pursue after him! Hold it right there, KID! I won't let you get away! You're not the type to quit so easily, right? That sword style... So, that's how it is... You should've said so from the beginning... ... Lupin III! LUPIN III LUPIN III LUPIN III LUPIN III LUPIN III LUPIN III LUPIN III LUPIN III LUPIN III LUPIN III LUPIN III LUPIN III LUPIN III LUPIN III LUPIN III LUPIN III LUPIN III LUPIN III CONAN CONAN DETECTIVE CONAN CONAN CONAN CONAN CONAN CONAN CONAN CONAN CONAN CONAN CONAN CONAN CONAN CONAN CONAN CONAN CONAN CONAN CONAN CONAN CONAN CONAN CONAN CONAN CONAN CONAN CONAN CONAN CONAN CONAN CONAN CONAN CONAN CONAN CONAN CONAN CONAN CONAN CONAN CONAN CONAN CONAN CONAN CONAN CONAN CONAN CONAN DETECTIVE DETECTIVE His name is Lupin III. A thief active world-wide... He always makes off with his target. An elusive, master thief. His partner is Jigen Daisuke. A professional with a 0.3 second quick-draw. A courteous, cool gunman. Don't call me Papa! Don't call me Papa! Don't call me Papa! Ishikawa Goemon XIII. He's an expert at sword-drawing and can cut anything in two. He's a dangerous person to anger. And lastly... ... the mysterious lady, Mine Fujiko. A female thief or a female spy. Even Lupin doesn't know. He's always getting into trouble because of her, so why does he include her as a friend? Lupin is soft against cuties. So it seems. He's high school detective Kudou Shinichi. While visiting an amusement park with his childhood friend and classmate, Mouri Ran... He witnessed scary men in black in the midst of a suspicious transaction. While caught up in watching the deal, he failed to notice his partner sneaking up behind him. That man forced him to swallow poison. And when he came to... What a surprise! His body had shrunk. And so... If those guys found out that Kudou Shinichi was still alive, they'd come after him again and put those around him at risk. So Kudou Shinichi decided to conceal his true identity. He named himself Edogawa Conan. He moved in with Ran and her father, who's a detective. Whatever. I'll just ask KID-sama. "K-KID-sama"? Kaitou Kid. Don't know? I know! The guy's called the "Magician Under the Moonlight," but he's still just a high school brat. Oh, wonderful! Hey, hey, which one? Which high school? Tell me, Lupin. Like you asked, I stole it disguised as KID-sama. Good evening, Lupin-kun. That was a pretty flashy show. If you know that already, then let's cut to the chase. Deactivate the bomb now. That... I cannot do. Excuse me? To see if you would really listen to a woman... I thought I'd bet my trust on that. A test, eh? In other words... ... a certain person recommended you. They said the only person who can steal the Cherry Sapphire is Lupin III; you're the only one. Thanks. So? I take it that I passed the test? Of course. I'll contact you once you get the Cherry Sapphire. That's when I'll deactivate the bomb on her. Oh, one more thing. I believe it's a waste of your time trying to trace this number. Looks like it. By the way, where does the signal locate to? It was in the mountains before, but now it's saying you're above America. I quit, I quit. I'll obediently obey. Since you're a person I should take seriously. I will never forget, too, that my opponent is Lupin III. Huh? It's perfectly cut into two. How did he do it? Right down to the circuits inside... How terrifying... Looks like you're more suited to this one. He put it inside the bucket? I just don't get him. He just wanted to create a scene, right? The police sure went far to corner him... Conan-kun has been watching TV the whole time. He looks down. As usual, he's always doing everything by himself. He was defeated by a guy named Goemon, right? News everywhere is saying Lupin III is in Japan. Goemon is Lupin's friend, right? Does that mean he's come to this city? It's time for your long-awaited quiz. Another punny quiz? I'm not really in the mood... We weren't even waiting for it. You guys, do something about it. Nothing will start without this, am I right? I'm extremely excited! I wonder if Ayumi will get it!? It's totally obvious if it's like that... I even prepared a whiteboard today. Yay! We've been waiting! Professor is the best! Look this way! I'm looking. What's Lupin's favorite beans? Soy beans Red beans Fava beans Green peas Among these four beans, one of them is Lupin's favorite. Green peas Green peas Green peas Green peas Green peas Green peas Green peas Green peas Soy beans Red beans Fava beans Green beans Now, do you know which one? I'll give you five minutes to think about it. 5 minutes later 5 minutes later Okay, did you figure it out? That was fast! It's all the same if you eat it. Genta-kun, you need to think harder about the beans. The answer is three, fava beans. Oh, why's that? Except for fava beans, they're all alkaline foods, but only fava beans are acidic food, right? Sansei = III Sansei = acidic m 7 11 b 13 11 14 11 14 6 b 14 1 13 1 7 1 b 1 1 0 1 0 6 b 0 11 1 11 7 11 "Acidic food"? I don't get it... Ooh! Soy beans Red beans Fava beans Green peas Fava beans Green peas Fava beans Fava beans Lupin...! Fava beans ... III! Lupin III (Acidic) Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Are you picking a fight? sign This morning, the Italian idol, Emilio Baretti, has arrived. He's a guy who travels all over the world. And here I thought I was never going to see him again... Awesome! Emilio is holding a live concert in Japan, Conan-kun! The Singing Nobleman, Emilio Baretti. Nobleman Emilio Japan!! He's very popular in Japan. My younger brother. Who? Did you see? I saw it. Wasn't she amazing? She was amazing. Probably the manager? She was an extremely beautiful lady, right!? Right!? Even though they're still kids, boys will be boys, eh... To have their hearts stolen by beautiful women... No comment. This was Aneda, reporting live. Wow, an amazing star has arrived, right!? There's no doubt about it! That was definitely Jigen Daisuke! Even Conan-kun! Eh? What? You're wrong! He's the worst, huh? Unbelievable. You guys...! You were looking! I wasn't looking! This was the diamond he mistakenly stole and these are the bullets stuck to the crane. "Mistakenly"? Would he make a mistake? That's Lupin for you. Lupin III Countermeasure Where is Lupin's gang hiding? He went through the trouble of disguising as KID, stole an unwanted diamond, and threw it into a fisherman's bucket... Without a doubt, he's challenging us. A challenge... His intentions are a complete mystery. Is he just fooling around as usual, Inspector Zenigata? The jewel he's after this time is the Cherry Sapphire. ICPO... You know him, right, Takagi-kun? A member of the ICPO who's solely in charge of capturing Lupin III. Thanks. I'm Zenigata. Inspector. Does Lupin always fool around? He does. Guys, I think it's best to think rationally. Then what's your reasoning for thinking he's really after the Cherry Sapphire? Yeah. He might be fooling around again. I got a text. What!? Y-you get text messages from him!? I do. However, he doesn't reply. He communicates through text messages, huh? Wanna see? Yes, we want to see! Hey, hey, you guys... Inspector Megure. May I borrow someone from here? I don't mind. Although, whether or not they'll be fit for the job... "Fit for the job"!? Huh? I can participate in capturing Lupin? Originally Division 2's in charge, but... Inspector Nakamori was forbidden to participate. He did mess up the Tsukishima River... Then...! As a special case, a few from here will... Me! Me! Me! Me!! M-Me too! To think I'm participating in capturing Lupin... Lupin III is Satou-san's first love. Takagi-kun! I see. Then I'll say this now That's not it. I didn't join for that reason... It's fine. Arresting your first love... You don't want anybody else to arrest him, right? I'm looking forward to it. Inspector Zenigata... I'll do my best. Sorry, but... I also love Lupin. It's hilarious that someone would park here. We'll teach you what it means to mess with traffic control. The number plate can't be verified. I wonder what that means, Senpai. It means it's not just an ordinary fake number, huh? It could be a suspicious organization... It's oozing with suspiciousness. Do people say "oozing" anymore? What? Nobody says it anymore? You parked here? Mhm. 2nd floor Traffic Dept. Come get it It was a car from Interpol. Our traffic control wouldn't understand that. It was probably Miyamoto-Miike duo's doing. I'll go to the traffic control department! I wonder if I got charged... Sonoko. Yes, yes? What's up? The TV? Right now? Welcome to Japan. Nobleman Emilio Japan!! What's one of your favorite Japanese food? Yeah, I'm watching. Natto = Fermented beans m 7 11 b 13 11 14 11 14 6 b 14 1 13 1 7 1 b 1 1 0 1 0 6 b 0 11 1 11 7 11 Natto. Tomorrow after school, let's go meet him. Yes, Emilio! The real deal! I know which hotel he's staying at. No way, no way! How do you know something like that? Just telling them who I am was all it took. That's all you had to do? But hey, what about personal information? No problem. Okay. There? Huh? Bye. Mhm. See you tomorrow. My, even Manager-san is beautiful. What are you saying? Geez, Sonoko. We can talk about homework tomorrow. You can meet Emilio? Eh!? Geez! Beautiful manager! You're on the same level as Genta and Mitsuhiko... I'm going too! Eh!? Is that necessary? It's typical for him to escape using a helicopter. You're going to shoot him down? Is this really okay? Maybe it would be best to relocate I believe it's best for us not to move too much. The more we move, the more chances Lupin has. As expected. Let's go to the safe room, you two. Yes, sir! M-Me too? It's a vault... Did you contact the owner of the sapphire? Yes. I suggested we temporarily relocate it to another place, but, no matter what I said, Eishin-sama said There's no need. I trust Japan's police. Looks like you're really trusted. We will definitely arrest him! Leave it to us! Right, Satou-san!? Hey! Everyone, let's do our best! Yeah! You're embarrassing, please stay still. Lupin will appear in five minutes! Close all roads. From here on, all vehicles are restricted. check here Henceforth, all officers, change your frequency to channel B. Has there ever been a time when Lupin didn't keep his word? Never. That means... ... there's a minute left. He must already be nearby then. Yeah. He might've disguised as one of us and infiltrated. Eh? W-Who!? Satou-san, stop! Don't move or I'll shoot! There's no guarantee he's disguised as a human. Other than humans? He can do that? What if that door was him in disguise? Sorry. I thought I'd try to lighten up the mood... I thought it'd be nice if you guys laughed... It's already past one o'clock. N-Nothing's happening. With all of this security, maybe he changed his plans...? Whatever he sets his eyes on, he'll definitely steal it. That's Lupin III. That means... ... Lupin's already inside the safe. It's in movies, right? The story where they dig a tunnel under the safe. Any cameras inside? Kashi Bank respects their members' privacy Just in case, let's check. No holes. Thank goodness! B-But maybe he swiped the Cherry Sapphire? You're saying it was stolen? N-No way! That can't be! You have both keys? Yes. I'm holding onto them for Eishin-sama. It's here. The Cherry Sapphire is safe. It's already three minutes past. M-Maybe... ... everyone's time is three minutes ahead? Wha!? It's one o'clock right now. I see! That time... You disguised as Takagi-kun and changed everyone's time by three minutes. Correct! Correct! That's correct! Perfectly on time. Tott-san = Pops or Old Man m 7 11 b 13 11 14 11 14 6 b 14 1 13 1 7 1 b 1 1 0 1 0 6 b 0 11 1 11 7 11 I'll be taking this, Tott-san. Once in a while, you need to recharge! See you later, my first love! Ouch, ouch, ouch! It's gonna break, it's gonna break! So you kept your promise... You got arrested by a cutie. Be happy! Tott-san, that's unfair. You know I can't fight against women. Let's see... Rewind three minutes. Lupin III, I'm arresting you for robbery at 1:02. Wow, amazing! It's a waste for you to be a detective. Umm... sorry to butt in while you guys are happy, but... Hm? If you move, I won't hold back. Lupin, this lady... is scary. Behind your watches, I attached a silver sticker. Is it still there? A sticker? It's there. What is... My shocky-shock sticker! It might be a bit stronger than a stun gun. Sorry, Nee-chan, but I'm returning this. You won't get away! Are you serious, Tott-san? Then I'll increase the voltage. Sorry, Nee-chan. You got caught in it too. Curse you! Tott-san, you're not a zombie... If I go any higher, it'll endanger Nee-chan's life. See ya! Lupin! How scary. It's Lupin! He's in the safe room! check here: sign He's disguising himself as Inspector Zenigata! It's Lupin! There he is! Get him! Go, go! Get in! It's not me! Ouch! Time out, time out! Lupin's in front of the bank! Lupin It's Lupin! He's the real one! We've secured the third Lupin. A fourth Lupin has been spotted in front of the tobacco store! We believe it's a fake. I'm from the TV station! Central command, has the real one been spotted? I found one Lupin in Beika Park. It's taken a liking to me. They're chasing one near Beika Station's north exit! Things got even worse! Lupin has entered Beika Street! All personnel enter through the south entrance! Excuse me for interrupting your shopping! Are you buying? Slacking on the job? That's alright! Fish, right!? Take that! And that! This is a dangerous world, isn't it, Granny? You're so kind. Next time, would you meet my grandson? I have no time to play with your grandson~! Dammit! We're playing right into his hand! What should we do? Call for reinforcements? The opposite. Call off the hunt. Eh? He's long gone. Where are you off to? My watch is fried... I really liked it too... Huh? We lost sight of Lupin... Being a thief is all in the legs, after all. I sure can't quit tag. Hey, hey... If you're not going to use a car or a helicopter, then it has to be Beika Station. But we can block the station in no time. From the bank to the subway the distance is too far. That's what I thought too, until I checked where the air vents and exits were. Excellent work, Onee-chan. I might fall for you. But give me a break. I really need this. W-Wait... Once you've recovered from the shock, let's play again. Up ahead should be a door connected to the power company... What the...!? 100 meters along West Beika line... there has been an incident! I'm scared... Are you okay, Satou-san? Takagi-kun! I'm glad I made it in time. Please don't be reckless. Why are you saying such a cocky line? Somebody got beat by Lupin, right? Yes, sorry. I let my guard down. Geez! I won't leave your side again. Oh, is that so? Eh? Cuffs? Eek! You're Lupin, right? That's not Takagi-kun's character. Oh, no, I was found out! Wait right there, Lupin! Huh? Hm? What's wrong? Just now, did you hear Detective Satou's voice? Huh? You must've misheard something. Sorry for bringing my dad... Not at all! It would be disgusting if he wanted to meet Emilio, but... it's that manager, right? Anyone would fall for her. Okay, here we are, Ran-ojosama! Sakurasaku Hotel Oh, please stop. How nostalgic. It hasn't been that long since then. Right. Wait here, I'll get the manager. You're going to bring her out? I am the one who splendidly solved the disappearance of Princess of Vespania the Great Detective Mouri Kogorou. Oji-sama, what are you doing? My assistant made an appointment. "Assistant"? Geez, what's he doing? Even if Dad suddenly shows up... Doesn't look like it. Excuse me. Detective Mouri, please come this way. Oh, okay! What's going on? What's going on? What is going on? W-What's going on? Let's go! Oh well! Ah, hold on! Interpol my butt! A violation is a violation. I don't care who it is; they'll pay for the towing. Money is valuable, after all. "Bring it yourself," he said! I'll make a dent! The key's inside? They said it was on the sun visor. How cliche. Senpai, Takagi-san is sleeping in the back! Huh? Why? What are you doing? Everyone is waiting in the conference room. My, my, did we make you wait? My bad. Exit and it'll be on your left. Okay~! It's this room. Oh! How nostalgic. Pardon me! Dad, you're supposed to knock! Who is this? Eh? Eh? No, it's nothing. Ah! Inspector Shiratori! Mouri-kun? Inspector-dono! What are you doing here? Hello. Is he here, is he here? Megure-san, who are these people? Ah, no need to worry. They are The number one great detective... Yours truly, Mouri Kogorou, Senorina. O-Okay... Please excuse him. I'm his daughter, Mouri Ran. I'm his assistant, Suzuki Sonoko! Please call me Sonoko! Every single one of you...! The reason Inspector Megure is here would be... I see. The front desk man mistakenly thought Occhan was called over here. Hey, did something happen? It doesn't concern you. Inspector Megure. "Takagi is alright." "However, the Cherry Sapphire was..." Lupin!? Lupin~! Fujiko-chan~! I was worried about you, you know!? Did they do anything funny? No, but I was scared. Aww, they put a tasteless necklace on you... You have a terrible sense of fashion! Let's get this over with. Hand it over to Fujiko-kun. How impatient. You don't like to chat? Don't take me for a fool! As if I would take out a gun. Think about the situation, geez. Forget the box; how about you just hand over the Cherry Sapphire itself? Good grief. What's with you? Besides, there's no trick. Eh? Sorry. You two were in it together after all? It's well-made, isn't it? But it's a fake. Also... Sorry, but I'm not handing it to you either. Okay with you? Throw your weapons down. Wow, as expected from Fujiko-chan! That's what I'd like to say, but... ... you were a bit soft this time. Hm? What was? No matter how you look at it, that bomb is real. No way! To deceive such a frail woman... you're the worst! You want it that badly? Here. So, what now? You want to see my head blown off from my body? check here Looks like my taste is being suspected. With this, the trade is complete. Once our lives are in the clear, I'll quickly release it. Of course, if this is a fake Don't worry. It's the real deal. Or what? You're not going to say this is another test, right? No. This is the end. I'll give you that wagon. The coat inside is a present. Thanks. We'll never see each other... ever again, most likely. check here This person, Luciano Carnevale-san, is in charge of events. Pleased to meet you. And this person is... My name is Claudia Belucci. I'm Emilio's manager. I know~! The reason we're here Inspector-san, is it alright to tell them? Even though he acts this way, Mouri-san is a trustworthy person. "Even though he acts this way," is unnecessary, but I will be useful. Actually, this was sent to Emilio. Hm? This is...! This is...!! This is... What does it say? check here You sure did create suspense, but... you can't read it, eh? That's so him. A message out of newspaper letters... Is it in Italian? "Cancel the live concert, or else, we can't guarantee Emilio's life." No way! A threat letter? Can't guarantee his life, eh? Who touched this directly? Not me. Emilio and I touched it. If fingerprints other than yours come up, it would be the culprit's, but... A culprit who leaves their fingerprints would save us time... Let's cancel it. I don't want to die! We just have to cancel it, right? Calm down, Emilio. Don't say "cancel" so easily! We spent an enormous amount of money on this concert. We even reserved a spot at Touto Stadium. Of course the tickets are sold out. You're well aware that we can't cancel it, right? Please, Lupin. Or else, this will explode. If you love me, please take the job. Geez, stop teasing me. Just tell me, "You reap what you sow." No, what I have to scold you on is what comes next. Whatever, I'm gonna ask KID. Because... Do you really understand? What? The one who can protect Fujiko-chanthere's only one person... And who is that? Lupin. Correct! Reclining chair! No...! Why not? Hurry up and run. Or else... If I can go to the afterlife with you... Wouldn't that be the best? That bastard! I'll make him regret tricking me! Fujiko-chan, return my clothes. Was it alright to disengage it? If we kill that woman, Lupin will come after us. Now's not the time. For my country... By all means, I must get it. Emilio staying at this hotel is not publicly announced. The ones who know are the staff and hotel employees. However, we can't disregard outsiders. A fan could use whatever means necessary to find out where he's staying. It could be a prank, but I'll post some undercover officers. With that, we'll see how it goes. I figured out the culprit. Eh? R-Really, Mouri-kun? Yes. The person who sent this threat letter was... ... Lupin III. Lupin? Lupin? Seriously, Occhan? He's the little rat who's been running around since the day before yesterday. Right when we think he boldly steals a jewel, he quickly throws it away. He probably didn't like it. Wasn't that phone call earlier a report about how Lupin stole another jewel? Right, Shiratori? What's gotten into you, Occhan? check here You're spot on! It's true we got a report just now, but... Is that and this threat letter related? The reason Lupin wants to cancel the concert and stole that jewel is for... That's for... "That's for"? Claudia-san! Eh? He plans to give the jewel as a present to the gloomy you. A present? Yes! He's planning to seduce you! This place is dangerous. By all means, come to my place. Emilio! Don't worry. I'm not going to leave my room. I still didn't get his signature... Let's go home, Sonoko. It's not the time for that. Let's go, Conan-kun. Oh, okay~! What about Oji-sama? When he gets like that, he's impossible. True. Anyway, let's assign a guard on this floor. It's probably okay. There's a really dependable bodyguard here, right? Huh? Boy, you know your stuff. I saw you on TV. Conan-kun! Ah, okay~! Are you a trustworthy guard? I educated a certain country's army and tripled their military power. I'm a charismatic instructor. Wow, Papa is amazing. Excuse us. Hey, there was a sweets shop down below, right? There was, there was! You have good eyes! Want to get some? Mhm, sounds good. It's the one above the lobby, right? Uh-huh. Huh? Conan-kun!? Hey! We're going to leave you behind, you brat! Please, don't leave me! Wha!? Now then, let's go play. W-W-Wait! B-But...! T-The brat grew up into a hottie! Sonoko, that's not it! A miracle happened! Sonoko~! Hey! Wait! Right now, Emilio is resting his hand on my shoulder and running~! Wait! Please, wait! Please stop for a sec! Sorry. Listen, Sonoko! Think rationally! Before that, isn't it, "Are you okay?" We've got to go back! This isn't the time to go out! Why not? "Why not?" There was a threat letter, you know!? What if something happened to Emilio? That's just a prank! What are you deciding on your own!? It was written on there, right? "We can't guarantee his life." I didn't see it~! Stop fooling around! You defeated Vespania's most strongest bodyguard! Don't exaggerate! 10km = 6.2 miles m 7 11 b 13 11 14 11 14 6 b 14 1 13 1 7 1 b 1 1 0 1 0 6 b 0 11 1 11 7 11 At any rate, there are no enemies within 10km! Sonoko... There! Let's go there! Yes! I'll go anywhere! We're going to get scolded! You want to dirty your clean lungs? The only place in the hotel where you can enjoy smoking and drinking is here, right? Yo, Great Detective. Sir, this place is... I came to pick up Papa. Is that so? Would you like juice or something? Ice coffee, please. Eh? Understood. What? check here You're not the only one who drinks iced coffee year round, right? What are you plotting in this city? You came here as Kudou Shinichi, eh? Thank you for waiting. If you'd like, please try this lemon pie. Wow, thank you! check here You've stooped so low... Idiot... So, your favorite phrase is "idiot"? Oh, and, "I'm going to the restroom." What the heck is that memo? Even though you're young, you have to be near a bathroom? Have a doctor examine you. Of course not! Got it now? Adults are scary. Threatening me, eh? Well, don't worry. If you don't stick your nose in, nothing will happen. Hey, in the memo, does it say something like, "I'm the type to retaliate if threatened"? Ah, so troublesome. Okay, I'll be taking this. Ah! You called me "Papa," didn't you? You just noticed? It's me. What's wrong, Ran-neechan? Emilio's gone? You're with Emilio!? What do you mean by, "he's not only with you"? Sonoko is with us, too. Everyone's searching for him. He said he'll return after going to the top. Tell Dad and the others Alright, I'll be taking this. Hey, give it back! Come on! Sounds fun... Got it. Your phone call... Ah, so yummy! Looks like they're with Emilio. Looks like it. Where are they? I don't know~. Let's settle this as adults. I'm going now. Okay, okay! I'll rip this memo to shreds. Hey, look. I'm going to do it. Okay? Papa is sorry. It's so fast! Amazing! I wonder if this is okay...? What was his bodyguard doing!? We won't get anywhere just talking about it. Let's search nearby. The detectives left, right? Yes. Though, that detective is still sticking behind. Did he go out to search? Yes. What a useless bodyguard! Sorry about this, but once I'm done, I'll see myself out. If it's in the hotel, it's got to be here. Wow! What a beautiful sunset! So hot! Ran, your face is scary. No good! Everyone looks suspicious... Come on, let's go back~! Don't tell me... Guess I'll check here too. The shoes were altered too... It's me. You were right. It's not in the hotel. Hm? check here Since it is concert equipment... What? Don't "what?" me. You said you're going to the tower first! I thought of going with Papa. Liar! So the bodyguard has a spare key? He didn't steal anything and you're going to arrest him? Just possessing a gun is enough. Hey, I'll tell you something from father to son. This business has absolutely nothing to do with you. Can you leave us alone? Your answer? I don't wanna. Hey, Onee-san. Yes? What is it, boy? Do you have Italian newspapers? Uh, sorry. We only have Age News in this hotel. Do you need it now? No, it's fine. Thank you very much! Umm, may I? What is it, Darling? Restroom I want to go there... Oh, h-have a safe trip. Hey, you're extremely behind. Huh? What do you mean? Oh! I know about the ruckus with Lupin. What was stolen was the Cherry Sapphire. It was in Touto Bank's vault. Is there something about that jewel? No. It's not special or anything. Nothing came up when I investigated. Lupin went as far as giving advanced notice... I see! It's the owner of the jewel! Correct. You finally caught up to Kojima-kun and the others. "Caught up"? Whoa, whoa. Those guys again? They're as pumped as always. Starting in the morning, they investigated all the vacant buildings. Even the tussocks and basements. Don't tell me. Lupin's hideout? If they found it, we wouldn't need the police. They found it. No way! Cherry Sapphire's owner, Wakagomo Eishin. Would a man using a bank vault be in an abandoned factory? Furthermore, the front shutters were renewed quite recently. Those guys researched that much!? The Professor is also all gung-ho about it. Professor...! I can't stop them... It's too dangerous! Don't let them go anywhere without me! Dammit! Let's capture Lupin and go to Hawaii! Yeah! That's impossible. check here Will this air on television? What? I forgot to tell you my request. Emilio's manager and the promoter! Mhm. Okay. Roger that. I'll investigate them. So, what are you How selfish... Find him? No good. Could he have gone down already? He pretended to go in, eh? I didn't take my eyes off him after that. He intended to ditch us from the beginning! Why? I don't know. At any rate, let's keep looking. Yeah. You really, really met Emilio? Huh? He's not here. He was the real deal! Emilio was here all alone? You saw Emilio? And you are? I'm Japan Tour's staff member. So it was really him!? What a beauty! He told me that, so I went to get an autograph board. During working hours? Ma'am!? You can't go that way! Call security! You're late. Sorry, sorry. We have to buy tickets. Here. Yay! You're so nice! Don't tease me! What are you doing, Emilio!? Ran-san! It's not safe to come here. Stop messing around! Don't come any closer! Please, tell me. Why are you doing this? The concert... I don't want to do it. I see. You're just tired. I think it's good to take a rest. It's impossible! As long as I live, it won't get canceled. Th-That's not right! There's no concert more important than a person's life! If they won't cancel it, I'll... I'll... In any case, please, get away from there. It's just us two, eh? To go up at this time... Anyway, they're still up there, right? I didn't get a message saying they returned. Hey, is Papa's hideout in the city? Hey, you. Don't think I'll answer everything just because you act like a kid. So you do have one! Why does it come down to that!? This is... This is not the way! I'm begging you! Please, let me hear your story! I... Emilio... Grab my wrist! Ran! Ran-san! I... Don't worry! Can you plant your feet? Yes. Ran! Sonoko~! Don't let out such a pathetic sound. Mouri Ran is amazing, you know!? I'm going to pull you up in one go! Ready, go! Ran! Sonoko!? Ra Hey, Ossan! Can you crack it open!? Is the one hanging, that girl? Yeah! How thick is it? Two 10mm panes! Child size coming right up! I'll jump. 12 rounds. Ran, don't let go of Emilio's hand! I'm going to pummel you! Making my best friend get stuck in this position...! Who do you think you are!? I'm going to pummel you until you're no longer attractive! So-Sono... ko... Can you do it!? Sorry, Sonoko... I'm losing... strength... Ran! Ran! Ran!! Ran-neechan!! Brat! Conan-kun! Yahoo! Thanks, Conan-kun! Good job! Good job, Brat! I'll hug you later! I'll pass on that. S-Sir, what are you doing? "What am I doing"? It's what you call "saving people's lives." Like I said, it was nothing. Don't worry. You... Not just yourself, but you put others around you in danger. Do you really understand? Please, think about it! Will you help us? Don't worry. Canceling the concert is never going to happen! Good. I just thought your idol was playing around too much. Making a commotion would obstruct the transaction, would it not? Did you call me just to say that? You're increasing the risk by doing that. The place and time I won't change them. Claudia-san also knows? She knows. More like, she knew from the beginning and is cooperating. The black market... Transacting what? I don't know. While I'm up on stage during the concert, I'm sure, during that time... This happened ever since Luciano became the promoter, right? Yeah, everything changed. The songs, stage, and TV staff... I wasn't even allowed to listen to demo tapes. But the most was Claudia. She was happier than anyone. She loved my songs more than anyone. You thought if the concert was canceled, the transaction would also be canceled? I'm very sorry. I had no intention of jumping. I'm sorry for jumping to conclusions. For hitting you, sorry. Thanks. You got serious for my sake, right? Ah, sorry. I still haven't returned it. Yeah... It's Dad. Yes? Mhm. I know. Yeah, he's with me. Geez! Don't yell! Hey, look at this cut-out letter. Eh? It was in your room. Uh, that was in my room? No more hiding. That hotel doesn't have Italian newspapers. Claudia didn't question the threat letter because she already understood. That means the 'K' didn't peel off, right? Yeah. If it was missing when opened, they'd notice. There were faint cut marks on the table. You used a cutter, right? In Italy, we don't typically use the letter K. Destruction of evidence! Can I? Expensive hotels don't quickly get rid of trash. When we return, we've got to hide the cutter and newspaper. The glue was with them too. Japan's police is amazing, you know? You, at the tower... Who on earth are you? Edogawa Conan, a detective. check here Was that a cliche or a stolen phrase? You're sort of really amazing. Your fans are waiting. Make the concert a success. I won't let the transaction happen. Also, I'll capture all the bad guys. Oh! I looked everywhere, you know!? It's not safe to be out this late at night. Do you know how much I was worried!? Do you understand? Many people were worried! Thank you very much. If Mouri-san didn't find him, who knows what would've happened. Oh, please, stop it. Tracking someone down is one of the basics of the basics. Emilio. For the people in this world to forgive your selfishness... I'm very sorry. I've caused a ruckus ever since we came to Japan. I'm reflecting on what I have done. Forgive me, Claudia. To prove I'm not just all talk, I'll sing at the concert. I'm going to make it the best, Luciano! I'm going to the staff room. The meeting for the stage is tomorrow. I wanted to apologize to the staff for all the commotion. Y-Yeah, sounds good. Mouri-san, what on earth did you say to Emilio? Pretty much what a parent should say to their child. It is I. You should abandon that hideout. The brat's bratty friends might storm in, it seems. In that situation, what should I do? Those guys have their cell phones off. Are they there? They said they'll sleep early for tomorrow. Prof. is already sound asleep. Don't tell me...! Yeah, probably... He's pointing his finger straight at me. Don't tell me... Yes, precisely. Take responsibility! responsibility! responsibility! We've always admired you! Welcome to Japan! Ayumi is very happy! Kitten's Egg Kitten's Egg Kitten's Egg This a little something for you... Kitten's Egg Kitten's Egg Kitten's Egg Kitten's Egg Here you go! It's yummy. Nothing suspicious is inside. Please, don't hold back. I am much appreciative. Ready? Do it just like we planned. When he falls asleep... ... we tie him up. A square knot, right? And then we will be... I shall make some tea. They fell asleep yet? They didn't suspect a thing. Why do I have to be the one hiding? You shouldn't be drinking what's given to you. Not much for being detectives... Time to check their belongings. You're going to strip them? Wha Don't say it like that! Oh! Fujiko-chan! Too bad, but this is as far as we go. Thanks to you, the bodyguard was fired. From here on out, there's no need for us to be together. See ya! He's doing terrible things to my friends! Keep it up. check here Like I'll fall for your child-like acting. You're an adult. Thief~! Don't yell that out! My body will react to it! Look, look. Luciano-san's information came. Are you listening!? The Italian Mafia? According to Intel from HQ, they're going to make a transaction in Japan, it seems. Lupin will be there? Most likely... Considering it's you, Inspector Zenigata, you aren't very confident, huh? Is something bothering you? There isn't enough information. Does he want the jewel or to crush the transaction? It's not like him? He's not the type Lupin would target. So he has a t-type, eh? How was your end? I finished investigating. Though, there's no need for it anymore. "No need"? Looks like they won't send a damage report or anything. From the beginning, it was strange. These guys are about to make a risky transaction. Would they call the police? Someone amongst them wants to interfere...? Shall we investigate and see? What's with all those toys? It's a bunch of interesting things. They're clever contraptions. To spoil the brats with these things... He must not be a proper adult. So? What are you doing, Fujiko-chan? Hm? Are you fleeing? What? I'm going to crush them. To say such vulgar words so easily... It's going to be dangerous alone. Who said I'm going alone? Don't tell me you got more "friends"? I asked them. Which "friends"? Everyone. It's going to be a world war... Don't worry. I won't get in your way. Plus, I told my friends to use normal weapons. How can we not worry? Any chance you did some research? Like I said, I won't get in your way. Fujiko-chan~! Load the kids in. I'll return them on my way. Eh? You're leaving? There's no way I'm staying in this dirty place. I just came to get the weapons. Let's leave it at that. I'll do as you say. At the concert hall? Yeah. If you inform Zenigata or the police, withdraw. That's where your detective job ends. That's your second warning. There's no third chance. I said I wouldn't let them do their business. I promised! Tell Lupin that! Good evening. Mine Fujiko... What should I do with these kids? They might catch a cold outside. Would you mind taking them? Can you give me your word you'll eventually come with me? Promise? Emilio, Japan Tour!!! Who stole Vespania's jewel? The Singing Young Noble Emilio Baretti. At long last, we can hear him sing tomorrow. Okay! Next up is an interview with a fan who'll be in line. Planning to make a trade at such a crowded place... They sure thought this through... When the concert starts, all eyes will be on the stage. Luciano issued to reorganize the stadium, it seems. He reorganized from the band's dressing room to the stage basement. If it's during the live show, people won't go there. How about hacking into the stadium's security cameras? They're ready. Do you understand the danger you were in!? If it wasn't a sleeping drug, you wouldn't be living anymore! Good grief! You guys left me behind! Professor! I'm sorry. I'll deal with Haibara! Okay... Okay... You're all grounded! Okay... Just like we planned, right? He won't get in our way. Haibara successfully infiltrated! Do you think Conan-kun will be surprised later? Once Ai-kun gives the word, we roll out. Yeah! Oh, boy... Yes? Yeah, I'm okay. I'm being treated well for some reason. Yeah. I won't tell them the real location. Sorry about that. Telling them to stop won't Who's that? Are you talking to that boy? Give me, give me. Long time no see! It's been a lifetime! He hung up. Why? Maybe he doesn't want to remember? Eww. I didn't do anything weird. What are you doing!? So cute. Did your chest shrink, too? Or was it like that even when you were Sherry? Of course not! It was more like No, I won't fall for that. Hey, want to join me and perfect the drug? The ideal APTX, that is. What are you going to do with it once I complete it? Of course, use it myself and become young! Eternal youth is every woman's dream. It's going to sell big and I'll be rich! Don't disappoint me. Eh? I'm not creating such a dreamy drug. You weren't like that in the past, right? Only driven by greed... Using your feminine charm to control men all over the world... Until you get what you want, you keep moving forward without turning back... A female thief... If a woman was captured by youth, wouldn't that be the end, Mine Fujiko-san? Yes. It's not loud here! Increase the volume! Got it! Looking good! Unlike usual, the staff are becoming one. Everyone's energized by Emilio's spirit. Mmm. After Japan, we're heading back to Europe. There'll be a vacation too. Is the transaction occurring in this room? What's wrong? Are you interested? Or is it some lame sense of justice? Mouri-san! Hm? Sorry to bother a busy detective like you. Not at all. I follow my sense of values when choosing which jobs to take. Tomorrow's the day. I won't be able to sleep tonight. Now that you're here, I don't need to step in. All I have left is to drink sake and sleep. It's all thanks to such a reliable guard. Leave it to me! Claudia-san Clau? No, I mean I'll definitely guard Emilio-kun. Claudia-san? Oh, Ran-san. As expected, feeling nervous? Yeah. Until this stadium is filled with people, I can't calm down. Even though the tickets are sold out? I still dream about it. It's an empty stadium and I'm running around all alone. You're running around? I sit on different seats and pretend to be an audience member. Maybe because I'm trying not to be noticed by Emilio... It is just a dream... It was real. Eh? Look. She's putting the surveys and concert schedules on each chair. That used to be my job. There was a time when not even 30 people could fit. Was it tough? Really tough, because I had no money. Being helpless was painful. I couldn't do anything for Emilio... I hated that. Claudia-san... Welcome. You sure haven't changed. I gathered the things you asked for. Did you find an unused Walther? Walther = A type of gun. m 7 11 b 13 11 14 11 14 6 b 14 1 13 1 7 1 b 1 1 0 1 0 6 b 0 11 1 11 7 11 The grip and spring of the trigger are custom made. It's really light. Good things never change, eh? The money's in the case. About the money... You can talk about it with the customer in the back. I see. No wonder I didn't feel a presence. I'm not a ghost. To think you're still in Japan... You already got the sapphire, right? As expected, King knows all. check here: shorter???????? You don't have to be in any business. If Lupin III makes a move, the news will be all over it. So? Why are you still here? First class to Naples. Could you leave on this? A surprise camera!? There are no cameras... Take your hands off Luciano. I know I shouldn't step in, but I have to. I want to properly settle things with you right now. For a woman? A kid. Screwed up? You're probably thinking the wrong thing. Even if you're right, I didn't screw up. Of course, I'm not asking you to do it for free. What are you up to? Naked photos of Okino Youko. Na And an embarrassing photo of Fujiko-chan. Ready, everyone!? Let's start! I'm going to the bathroom for a bit. Me too. I'll be guarding the stage. And so... I'm all alone... Strange! Do you see Lupin? I don't see Luciano either. The last footage of Luciano was... this one. It was thirty minutes ago. Where's that? A door leading to the underground parking lot, but no cars exited. Look at this! The underground passageway was lengthened! What is this!? It was lengthened for VIP members and the staff were silenced about it. We investigated that construction place before! Did you see me? It didn't even capture you going in the underground passageway. He got us! There's a road here. Wait. How about the cameras outside? That spot... is no good. Your car doesn't show. If we check the history, we might know which way he went. The time would be... A passing car... That's...! Co-Conan-kun! What? He's not answering. That boyIs he always like that? Unlike usual, he was on fire. Am I the only one who thinks that? Where are you going? You two use science and technology to find him. I'll pursue him with my intuition. So you knew? Emilio believed in you, Claudia-san. He doesn't want you to keep doing evil things anymore. Let's see... 20 radishes. A box of cabbages... Oh, man... He even broke the cash register? Yeah, yeah. Because I failed to catch Lupin, I was taken off the case, and now I have to pay for the damagesPoor me, what can I, Takagi, do for you? And of course, I've written apology letters. What are you saying? Is Detective Takagi there? Oh, it's you guys! What's up? What!? New bills have arrived. Sorry! I'll leave the rest to you! Eh!? You can't do that! As expected! Detective Takagi's really reliable at these times. He always believes us, am I right? Ai-chan's so mean! Why'd she tell us the wrong location? Hmm... Maybe she was threatened into telling us the wrong location. Let's quickly go save her! Conan-kun said he'll do something about it! First off, we have to meet up with Detective Takagi. Let's capture them all! Yeah! What? You've been using my laptop this whole time. Telling your friends false information? I don't want them to be in danger. So you're an expert in betrayal? Just like how you betrayed your former organization? But there's no need to worry. Betrayal is a woman's accessory. You're going out? You can go home. I trick men, but if a man tricks me, I won't forgive them. Want to tag along? It's going to be really dangerous. Old Haneda Maintenance Facility This is our first time meeting face-to-face, eh? Pleased to meet you, Mr. Luciano. Call me Alan Smithee. "Alan Smithee"? So that's the other party? That's what Luciano called him. Did he say where the transaction's taking place? Luciano never spoke to anyone where it was. I see. The airport, so you can prepare for the next destination, eh? This was brought over to this country illegally. Well, even if it was searched, they wouldn't find anything suspicious. What the...? A keyboard? The thing you want is... this. I have liberty to manufacture it in any way, right? Well then, I've brought the promised item. This is the promised Cherry Sapphire. "Sapphire"? What is that? What kind of joke is this!? What? Whoa! Doing shady things in the dark... Don't make me work up a sweat! What!? I told you, didn't I? If I meet you again, I'll capture you. Nice commitment, but didn't Papa tell you to quit playing detective? Geez. You bastard! You betrayed me! Hmph! Fire me. This is your one and only last chance. If you back off, I'll let you go. Idiot! There's no way I'm letting this chance go. You've fired a gun before, right? Too bad. I had plenty of practice shooting in Hawaii. You tricked me! What's with that jewel!? Looks like I was set up. Do you know a man named Kein Gejidasu? "Kein"!? Who's that? I don't know such a person! My mistake, huh? Kein Gejidasu, eh? Did you figure it out, Detective Nerd? Good job finding this place. Want to know how? Later. I don't mind. Get rid of them. Now's your chance! Tatsumaki gaeshi! Deflecting cyclone! Goemon, you're doubling the risk~! Unskilled... Don't reflect now... Out of the way! I've cut... petty things... Outta my way! Arrest! The brakes aren't working! Don't move! That's as far as you go! There's still more? As expected of Jigen! You've gotten better! That wasn't me! Nor was it me. Obviously... Then, who? Freeze! I got you, Lupin. I'm FBI Jodie Starling. I'm taking you into custody. What!? Shootout at Haneda Airport? It used to be a maintenance base, but now it's where private jets land. They plan on flying away, eh? Points A, B, and C are all clear. Mm. Our target is him. Don't let your guard down. Why did the FBI come? I called them. There's no way I'd come here without a plan. Darn it! I can't aim. He's purposely covering her. We're also freely doing whatever in Japan, you see? We could hand you, an international fugitive, over to Japan's police and have them owe us a favor. Jodie-kun, hurry up and cuff him. Got you. Behave yourself. Okay~! Wait! You shouldn't carelessly touch him. Who knows what he's hiding under his clothes... That snotty brat! Put your hands up and get down on your knees! Yeah, yeah. First I'll put you to sleep... ... without a doubt. Honestly, what an annoying brat... You bastard! Stop! Shoot me if you want. However, even if you cut my head off, I will still pull the trigger. Return the case. Here. Nobody make a move. Mind standing back? Don't make me shoot the kid! Fine, so let's keep it cool, okay? Isn't now your chance, brat? Ah! Alan-san, what about the promised money? Weren't you trading it for money? Pilot, can you hear me? Yes. Turn the engines on. Get ready for take off. Roger! Carry the case. The money's inside the plane. Bring the car here! Yes, right away! This is Satou. We'll arrive in three minutes. Please, keep the gate open. What are you doing, Takagi-kun!? Whoa! This isn't good... Don't lose Prof.! They're going to overtake us! We have Detective Takagi on our side! Got it! No, this is bad... Civilians need to make way! Where's your car? You're thinking of secretly chasing them? I ordered a chopper. They'll get away. They're targeting us, right? Lower your gun. They won't shoot us. Go. We'll take off anyway. Ignore traffic control. Aww, man... My Alfa Romeo-chan... What now? Chase after them on foot? What? Lupin~! Fujiko-chan! Who's that? Mine Fujiko. Bust-Waist-Hip m 7 11 b 13 11 14 11 14 6 b 14 1 13 1 7 1 b 1 1 0 1 0 6 b 0 11 1 11 7 11 Her BWH is 99-55-88. She is yet another international fugitive. Is it over? Nope! We're just getting started. Lupin and even the FBI... Both of them pulled back for you. Kid... Who on earth are you? Why am I steering? Then, do you want to shoot? Don't worry. It'll be over soon. W-Wait a sec, Fujiko-chan! The brat's still on! Who cares? If you plan on shooting him, I'm going to crash this bike. Then, will you tell me that drug's secret? Fine. Okay, then I won't need this. Oh, my! You trashed it! I'm using this one. Speed up. Change gears! Oh~? Don't tell me, Sherry-chan... My bike was a Harley, too. Got a problem? Don't take your eyes off the boy. Yes, sir! Okay. Start moving. I'm getting a bunch of complaints. JB27, stop at once! There's a plane heading towards you. JNA301, please, do not land! JB27! JB27! Are you planning to...? I'll stop them even if I have to crash into them! I shouldn't have come... check here Ready. Take off. We're taking off! Gear up. Gear up! JNA pilot, do you copy? Keep going. We'll dodge. Get ambulances to the old maintenance facility! There are many casualties! Why won't you let us through? Like I thought, this might be impossible. There's a detective riding inside, you know!? Please, don't... Tell them off! Thank goodness! Ai-chan's safe? Show your detective badge! Mhm. Mhm. Conan-kun, what are you riding on? Ouch! What kind of piloting is this!? I know, right? I almost fell off. What? Thanks a lot, brat. Huh? Making things more bothersome... What were you thinking? What? Don't act dumb. With all that gunfire, fortunately, there weren't that many deaths. The FBI came under your orders, right? You thought of the power balance and didn't strike the last blow. How troublesome! If we had let them kill each other, it would've been settled. That's what you were aiming for? Yeah, and it would've went perfectly. Want to leave the cleaning up to me? If it doesn't go your way, don't blame me. We finally got it, didn't we, Captain? check here Yeah. With this... Jiranba can fight back. Wow! You're head is a rock! You idiot! Give it up! That's his fate. Don't think we're even now. It's okay now. I can smell the salty air. It wouldn't have been strange if it fell. We've got to thank them later. m 7 11 b 13 11 14 11 14 6 b 14 1 13 1 7 1 b 1 1 0 1 0 6 b 0 11 1 11 7 11 I'm surprised you were able to control it with this. I'm taking charge. The throttle is still okay. Controlling the horizontal stabilizers are tricky. Yeah, got it. Hey, brat! The pressure is zero. This aircraft is equipped with a sub, right? How surprising. Who... exactly... are you? Don't talk anymore. He's Kudou Shinichi. I'm a high school detective. A high schooler, eh? You can still... do... many... things... My country... still has many... young... This guy's country is being treated like a colony by a neighboring country. It's brutal. What's his real name? Alan Smithee was just an alias? Who cares? Leave it as Alan Smithee. Ordered to shoot it down!? Jiranba's embassy is demanding it! Like I said, a boy is on it! Please connect me to Superintendent Matsumoto! We're going to fly all the way to Hachijou Island. How about you go back to Haneda and turn yourself in? The FBI will be there, too. Don't talk nonsense! You bastard, if you shoot me, we're falling, you know? I can manage. Don't underestimate me! I'm so serious, I'm wearing seat belts. Quickly fix the telecom and radar. Yeah, yeah. Once I fix this, are you going to report to Vespania? Interesting. When did you figure it out? I figured out you were using Vespania's jewel early on. At the hotel, Jigen Daisuke was using dowsing rods. What he was looking for with that was Vespania's jewel, right? I've seen it done in Vespania before. What was he thinking... With just that, it doesn't pinpoint it to Vespania. At that time, yeah. When he opened the case, wasn't it checked if it was real or not? By who? How? Jigen Daisuke was shooting microwaves at it. It showed small traces even though it was dark. Want to hear from the beginning? Fine. This might be your last deduction. It wasn't even close to being a deduction. This was child's play. The one who left the Cherry Sapphire in the bank for safe keeping was Wakagomo Eishin. Also, the name that was mentioned during the transaction... Do you know a man named Kein Gejidasu? "Kein"!? Who's that!? WAKAGOMO EISHIN ISHIKAWA GOEMON KEIN GEJIDASU JIGEN DAISUKE Wakagomo Eishin is Ishikawa Goemon. WA WA WA KA KA KA GO GO GO MO MO E MO E I E I SHI I SHI N N SHI N I SHI KA WA GO E MO N Kein Gejidasu is Jigen Daisuke. They're anagrams. KE KE KE I I I N N N GE GE GE JI JI JI DA DA DA SU SU SU JI GE N DA I SU KE Couldn't you have done better? Wakagomo Eishin was solved by the Detective Boys, you know? Thanks to you, they got all hyped up and invaded your hideout. You're so mean. Jigen and Goemon tried really hard. That means you went out of your way to steal the Cherry Sapphire Goemon left. Furthermore, Jigen Daisuke as Kein Gejidasu, offered a trade and the Cherry Sapphire was the condition. The only person who can steal it was... ... Lupin III. That's what I thought. In other words, from the very beginning, your main objective wasn't the Cherry Sapphire. You got close to Alan, who was trying to get Vespania's jewel that was stolen, and investigated who he was paying to get it. Your plan was to steal it then. If that Cherry Sapphire is originally yours, it should have a tracking device in it. I used that and somehow managed to get to the transaction scene. By the way, did Mine Fujiko become your ally in order to get the jewel back? Emilio, Japan Tour!!! Who stole Vespania's jewel? The fact that the jewel was stolen was posted online. Stupid~! Why would I steal back a rock that was already stolen? It's not even worth a cent. However, you tried to get it back. Hmm, I wonder why? How should I know? Stop with the riddles. The reason why is... It's the jewel Princess Sakura, the previous ruler of Vespania, tried to protect. You were probably asked a favor by Sakura, that tomboy princess, but... If only you'd figured the person who stole the jewel was Luciano, then you wouldn't have had to come to Japan and get into this mess. I deliberately let things slide by, so I can meet the little, cocky, great detective right here. How rude. Okay, it's usable now. Thank you. It happens often, right? The line, "You know too much." In the world, your image is very important. Lupin III saving people? Make those sorts of jokes after you put the safety lock on. You're so funny. Eagle 1 to HQ. Code 1027. Please confirm. Air Defense HQ Code confirmed. You have permission to use missiles. I repeat: You have permission to use missiles. You had a hearing with the count!? Kingdom of Vespania - Royal Room If by chance we are unable to retrieve it... If you're unable to... ... you need to destroy it before it leaves Japan. You should've thought of a backup plan if you knew! You're the miscalculation! You disguised as KID! How can I sit still!? You don't know what a joke is!? Incoming! Full throttle! We have flares! Fire! This is JB27! Cease fire, Eagle 1! Target launched flares. It didn't hit. Vespania and Jiranba... Both countries made a demand. Permission to fire missile. Roger that. The next one's serious! We don't have anymore tricks up our sleeves! That's the Cherry Sapphire. I chiseled it from a small rock. This!? Don't tell me that small rock was... Yeah! Fujiko had one before. That was also Vespania's jewel. There's a high voltage panel in the weapon storage! On it! Not just stealth devices, it can disable all electronics using high voltage device. If this went to the hands of another country... ... the balance of the military powers will collapse! Is that it!? What's wrong, brat!? Hurry up! Not good! We've been locked on! Ascend! Make it float! I get what you mean. Hold on tight, brat! Just a bit more. I've got only... Now! ... one chance! Wh-What's happening!? What the... Abort mission! Eagle 1, do you read me? Abort mission! A civilian is on board! Please, abort mission now! Eagle 1, roger that. However, a mysterious light appeared and the target's going to crash. A boat!? This is Eagle 1. I've spotted a parachute. I see it! Point 0925. There's a parachute. We've been spotted. They won't shoot at us anymore. Hey, the Marines are coming now, aren't they? And bringing the FBI along. I didn't go that far. No! I can't trust you. Fall! You snotty brat! Ah, o-o-ouch! Ah! Stop! You're hurting my arms! You're a threat! Encore! Encore! Emilio! Emilio! Were you watching? Emilio! Yes, it was great. Will you continue to be by my side? You should go back. Where you belong is there. Let's go! Mm. Mm. I see. That's good. Inspector-san... For allowing me to watch until the end, thank you very much. Am I missing something? Excuse me? In the end, everything sank down to the bottom of the ocean, eh? I hate this kind of turnout the most. You're creeping me out. What's with that cocky smirk? You're making the same face too. It tickles when you do something good for people. It's as if a thief is drilling a hole deep into your inner heart. Stupid~. Th-This submarine is... Does it bring back bad memories? Hi! Are you okay, boy? Did something happen between you and her? I hate cramped places. Truly. Like I thought, you survived. Haibara! You're with them? What's with that tone? If it wasn't for me, you would've been burnt to a crisp. Yeah, if I didn't listen to her request, I would've fired. "Request"? Oh? I don't know what you're talking about. Hey! You plan on betraying? Betrayal is a woman's accessory. Right? Emilio! Please, come back again! Thank you, Edogawa Conan. After all that's happened, he still has all these fans. He'll be alright. So, I wonder what Lupin and the gang are doing now. No clue. They're probably after another country's jewels or something. Thief coming! He's so soft. There's no way I would come all the way to Japan and leave empty handed! What is this!? Where's the treasure!? "Pardon me for being first." Pardon me for being first. Kaitou KID Pardon me for being first. Kaitou KID Pardon me for being first. Kaitou KID Pardon me for being first. Kaitou KID Pardon me for being first. You're under arrest, Lupin! You've got to be kidding me~! You're not getting away! It wasn't me! Believe me, Tott-san! Who would believe you!? That bastard! I'll remember this, KID! If it has come down to this...
