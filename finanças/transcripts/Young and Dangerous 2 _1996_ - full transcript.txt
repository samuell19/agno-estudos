She has a trick specifically to tease a man's inner thigh -It's next to Jiji -Next to it? When she squeezes it down, it feels so good... It's so cool -So smart? -Yes I also want to try Look, there's another fight. Didn't you just tell you last time? The Legislative Yuan fights all day in meetings, and the chairs are also picked up to fight, you see Climbing up to get things Even female committee members fight -Women fight too -It's Taiwan style Our boss seems to have been beaten by someone , let's go and help. Zhang Dingkun, that lunatic -Son of a bitch! -Boss, what's wrong? I'm fucking 18th generation ancestor! Whoever kills him will get their own Triad branch Which bastard wants to crush my boss?

I will repay that kindness. You'll be successful one day Actually I've had a question in my heart for a long time -I want to ask you -Go ahead. You are already the leader of the San Luen Gang Why do you want to be a legislator? You sit down first Do you listen to the example of the chamber pot? -What chamber pot? -The chamber pot is the urinal Convenient when you want to piss in the middle of the night But dirty and filthy during the day Politicians have the same view of the triad. During the day they shun us as corruption But when the night comes, they call upon our aid like helpless welps Once the sun is out, they kick us away again I can't be that chamber pot anymore So I went into politics From passive to active No wonder the triad in Hong Kong and Taiwan are so different I have a lot to learn from you Did you try it last night? -Try what? -Don't be afraid, I don't mind I really don't know what you said I don't care about sex You are young and she also needs Love between men and women is normal -I don't have -I can tell at a glance Ding Yao really works You can use this kid to build a relationship with Hing Hung's Mr. Jiang You are so bold, what happened next? After that day, Mr. Lei put a lot of faith in me He made me leader of the Viper Hall Then I heard the news that you had needed help in Hong Kong, so I rushed back Lei Gong gave me money and men You really have to thank Mr. Lei This kind of big scene is not often seen You are a newcomer , don't talk nonsense, do you know? Understood Hey, who told you to sit down? Stand properly Nam, don't worry We in North Point and Chai Wan have always been side by side with Causeway Bay Let Hong Kong Island prosper together Brother Ge, then you have to take care of our brother Nam Brother Nam, don't forget us The company hasn't decided yet, many things are still unknown Who else is could be Causeway Bay boss? Who else is qualified to do it besides you? joke! Kidding! Long time no see! Nam, I almost forgot to say hello to you. Come and shake hands. It's a bit dirty, I'm sorry for this bad habit Brother, who is that person? Pick his nose like this Why are you asking so much? Didn't I tell you to shut up? Okay It's clean, I sucked it all Today, you are the leader Let me be the ladder, okay? This piece is too difficult to dig out The business of the club is generally stable Now society is changing rapidly Recently my family bought a computer Playing on something called the Internet What net? How to play? Forget it I mean, you can't stick to the rules now. If you stay where you are, your enemy will take two steps ahead of you Ten days ago, I reached an agreement with Mr. Ho from Macau There is a new hotel in Taipa We got the right to operate the casino inside It's really great! In addition to our other businesses, I think we need pay a vist to Macau Sure I plan to hand over this position to the boss of Causeway Bay Mr. Jiang, Causeway Bay has no boss yet So now we have to choose someone Mr. Jiang, I have a proposal The candidate must be a righteous guy Someone who can make money and won't take money. Yes yes I suggest Tai Fai Tai Fai! Yes! Thank you for giving me face Thank you for your nomination Do not look at me and think Tai Fai is usually sloppy, sloppy, sloppy I'm not I'm a fucking boyscout I am a righteous guy! As long as I sit in this position, I will definitely go all out Bravo... Tai Fai, many brothers support you Thank you all for your support Ok, ok, ok, ok I want to hear any other nominations? Mr. Jiang, I also have a proposal I think Nam is quite suitable for this position Yes I agree Nam has always been loyal Yes, he avenged his eldest brother Bee. He deserves this position, right? Correct He usually treats us old guys very well, right? -Yes -QUIET! Don't say I'm stingy Anyone can sit in this position, except this bastard! What are you talking about? He can't spell Righteousness? How good is he? Tai Fai, explain yourself I, Tai Fai, never talk nonsense The three rules of the rascal. Loyalty, pay your way and respect brother's women. He seduced second sister-in-law, but doesn't talk about it But even worse is he's not loyal to the brotherhood Remember my beloved brother Tong? Was he hacked to death by you? Fratricide! Yes, I killed Tong to get my promotion Is there anything wrong with this? Being a rascal, fighting and killings are nothing special. He wasn't my friend. Did you hear that? He said it himself He's not righteous Are you qualified to be the leader of Causeway Bay? -Isn't this called unrighteous? -Is this still loyal? Then I have nothing to say Enough trouble! This is rascals, friends become enemies become friends. Everyone fights for promotion This is too boring, right? -Yes -Ok Are there any other besides these two nominations? No In this case, choose one of them as the boss How many clubs were Bee responsible for in Causeway Bay? We have six nightclubs, four casinos Split them equally Within one month, whoever performs better will take over the position of Bee Mr. Jiang said so, of course it's okay Nam, do you have a problem? A one horse race is no fun, no fun at all Too boring Hold the phone! What is going on here? There is not a single living soul, is it haunted? Brother Tai Fai, nice to see you. Two guys refuse to pay their check Dare to not pay in my club? really interesting They must own stock in coffin companies? It's not that we won't pay, the prices are unreasonable Okay, I am a person who likes reasoning, let's talk I don't understand how you do business We were here for hours, just two girls served us Kidding? Sir, you wanted girls with good figures We gave you two girls with good figures But they are so ugly! Are you sick, brother? My girls are all famous for pretty looking Each can drink, sing, and fuck -Which two did you call to sit on the stage? -Qingxia and Carina They are for cleaning toilets! Where did Manyu, Liti, and Feifei go? They all resigned How can you make people quit? I heard KK poached them away But you have to pay! Do you know that I run this place? But I am a very reasonable person Then let's negotiate I also think you are right not to pay I wasted hours of your time. Now I have... -No need -Let me pay your taxi fare, sorry Sorry I'm very sorry Okay, don't be so polite I will offer you nice girls next time Where did the girls go? Nam's club What's wrong? Shy? Did you take part in it? No, Big Fai, I didn't do anything Not you? Tell me, did you do it? -No, it's not me -Are you bastard? Son of a bitch! -Not you? -Boss! -Don't kill him! -go to hell!

You are like a tomato, not a pimp! If you try, I won't give you an easy time I'm just talking, not really KK, please Why don't we two mamasang together Let's help Nam's club be the best in Causeway Bay That's a good idea. Sisters, let's start working -Hurry up -Start work Start Ok wait Brother, phone Hey? Hey? Who the fuck are you fucking? who are you? Big fly What are you fucking? Are you sick?

Fighting for power and profit They cheat no matter if they are amateur or professional He's triad! How could he be a good person? How about you? Yes, your elder brother is not a good person either I don't care if he is a good person. The important thing is that I like him. Yeah, but don't you know 9 out of 10 rascals have a sad ending So many rascals When young So famous It's very miserable when they're old Sleeping on the street, some freeze to death, some starve to death It's useless to claim to be brothers than Buy a sleeping bag, it's almost the same Buy a sleeping bag Hey, what's wrong with you? So embarrassing Are you crying? how is this possible? I will rape you Let me see if you are handsome Yee -What happened to you? -Second Uncle, why are you hurt like this?

How much money did you lose? -More than four hundred thousand -Really? More than four hundred thousand are really missing Those robbers said they took hundreds of thousands But will the robber tell you how much money they took? Isn't it weird? You don't need to be so angry I was robbed of hundreds of thousands in one go. Nam, your woman went to the hospital At least 10,000 a day Mr. Jiang, you have to believe me Nam won't touch a company dime I know you very well It's like killing Tai Fai's buddy Tong You did that for the company! Tai Fai is very loyal Always protects his buddies But he was betrayed again and again It turns out that Tong was an informant for the police, he didn't even know Bee and I wanted to help him when we found out But I don't know where to start If you let his other brothers know he was taken in Isn't it embarrassing to say that my eldest brother is so stupid ? To save face I thought about it and decided to let you take care of the rat Don't mention the past This time this happened and even the account books were lost I have nothing to say Nam you lost two hundred thousand -Let's share the loss. -Thank you Mr Jiang That bastard's hands and feet are really clean Take it, do whatever you want with it.

I'm a stupid dog dog I thought that with the words of Chicken I could bring peace between Hong Kong and Taiwan Who knew that stealing a chicken is impossible It's shit... You dumped Lei Gong? Lei Gong, is a politician in Taiwan I said, My Chicken will not be the master of the Viper Hall Thought it would be alright, political But result is a lot of trouble But this is Hong Kong He is a stranger here He is a powerful stranger! Kill someone and run away back to Taiwan The Taiwan triads are more lethal than Hong Kong triads These people die without worry They're like the Colombians in Scarface, they'll fuck you up with a chainsaw We have done killing The most important thing is to be flexible and have a way You're pretty optimistic I'll just marry you. Yes or No? Miss, we are closed Is Chicken here? Chicken, someone is looking for you -What are you doing here? -Looking for you Come on, Nam This is the woman I often mention to you, Ding Yao This is my good brother, Ho Nam -Hi -I heard that you are Hung Hing's No. 1 strong general Chicken is lucky to be your friend.

Lei Gong has a bad temper sometimes When he hears something he doesn't like... Why did he hit you? I know he kicked you out of the San Luen Gang And is giving you trouble I had to say something nice about you Fucking bastard Do not get angry I changed his mind I told him that both tigers get hurt when they fight It's just money, just share it? He agrees with me He said he wanted to see you, with Brother Nam See me? -Where does he want to meet? -Macao Will he order his thousands of henchmen to attack us? Do you not believe me? I don't believe you Whose hair? Not mine Is it yours?

Do not come! -Brother is so good to you -She framed us! -You actually killed him -Go! -Kill me too! -Step back! -Put down the gun! -Put down the gun -You murderer -Drop them now? Go that way! -Your big brother -Isn't he joining the San Luen Gang? Do you know what you are doing? Of course I know what I'm doing, what are you doing? Let me introduce This is my sister This is Small Potato, don't worry about him I have seen him. Where are Chicken and Ho Nam hiding? They killed our boss, and I must avenge him... Bitch! -The last time I beat you was I not cruel enough? -This is Macau, not Wan Chai! Fuck off! Then everything you told me before had the weight of a fart! Well, I don't have a big brother anymore! I will settle accounts with you later, let's go! Be careful, Tai Fai We are all sad about the Lord Lei Lei Gong Unfortunately, he was killed by the traitor Chicken and died in a foreign land. Lei Bangzhu left his last words If he dies or has an accident All affairs of this group will be temporarily taken over by Ms. Ding Yao All legal procedures are handled by Lawyer Liang Zehao Elections will be held at the triennial tri-gang conference Where a new leader will emerge I've settled the influence of the San Luen Gang in TaiNam and Kaohsiung About the vacancy in the Legislative council, I intend to be selected for a by-election candidacy I'll follow the old man's old road You seem to be very excited today, and you keep talking I haven't been this happy since I became the old man's bodyguard By the way, what's your plan for the trash heap vampire? Hong Kong and Macau are not our territory It's better for us to have him Are you fond of him? Gao Jie, I have known you secretly for so many years, don't you believe me? There used to be Chicken, I don't want to have another one Unexpectedly, Gao Jie is six feet tall But has the confidence of a four foot tall A Yao, I still believe in you... You'll continue to be leader For now, I will be your dumb bodyguard But I want you to be dumb forever Fuck you bastard! Throw you into the sea and flush you to hell! This guy is really lighting the toilet Fight with me for women, find shit (find death)! Then you must protect me from now on No problem, move over baby Daddy's driving -See you later, I'll go first -OK Go! If it wasn't for my courage To jump in my underwear I'd been eating salted duck eggs with Uncle Xing and Xiao in the long ago! It's not right! The Taiwanese are going against the Hung Hing Society I think it's not against Hung Hing But against certain people Aki, does your head still hurt? Mr. Jiang, these old bones of mine won't die from such a little injury. But, I am mad for being attacked... The San Luen Gang deliberately attacked, it was premeditated Let's not blame our brothers If you need to blame someone, than me I'm the person in charge of Hung Hing Blame me for not protecting Hung Hing Also, the gambling rights of Macau casinos They spent a lot of money to buy Mr. He's cronies and we lost Mr Jiang Chicken is here today Not to say sorry to you Ho Nam is my brother As for the Macau incident I will give you an explanation Mr. Jiang, we are being bullied we need to respond So I decided to declare war on those Taiwanese Is there any mistake, Mr. Jiang If you fight yourself, how can we have face? -Exactly -Are you afraid I can't handle it? Do not worry Mr. Jiang, let us do the fighting I have been framed Now, I absolutely believe in my brothers I hope you will give us two weeks to handle the matter Nam, deal with it, don't lose Hung Hing's face Father I really don't know what to do I feel so confused now One is the woman I loved But she betrayed me I feel sad But I have to stand up in front of outsiders Well, you go home and hide in the bed Crying under the quilt will make you more comfortable If only it was that simple On the other side is my good brother from childhood I must help him If he doesn't win this time, he is finished But I don't want her to lose Why do you consider winning or losing so important? Back in the day The Romans nailed Jesus Christ to the cross Watched him die They won! Right? Who knew that after three days, Jesus Christ was resurrected And spread his teachings all over the world So what? The largest Holy See, the Vatican, is also in Rome So who is the winner and who is the loser? You seems to make a point But it seems like you haven't said anything It seems...it seems to make me realize something I think I know what to do Jesus, I really didn't teach him to kill people I'm going to work Don't worry, don't worry, I won't leave you alone I thought about it I am engaged to you first I'll come back to marry you Even if you become a vegetable Still an idiot, I promised to marry you, I will marry you Bye Macau reporters are here Miss Ding, let us take a picture first!

The Jade Dragon Casino is drawing our customers They're giving triple play chips and took away our guests Don't we have a chartered plane flying over from Taiwan? No, a bomb was dropped in the airport lobby today They received threatening calls saying that there are five bombs The police officers are searching the lobby The planes were not allowed to land, so they turned to Guangzhou Ding Ding, I really don't know what to say I thought there was only traffic chaos in Taiwan Unexpectedly, the traffic in Macau is the same Seven container trucks collided in series on the Taipa Bridge The cars are jammed Doesn't Macau have a second bridge? The second bridge is all defecate, traffic chaos The third bridge has not been built yet Where's the gambling group? Haven't you already arranged it? Brother Fai, it's not lucky if you don't cut the ribbon No one comes, it really is unlucky Don't lose face in front of so many VIPs Cut the ribbon What's happening?

Mr. Barros, let's cut the ribbon Miss Ding, please wait Today we are here just to give you face, we don't want to see fighting among triad societies Otherwise, our police won't give you face -Of course -That's good Give way -Which bastard sent it? -I!

Ding Yao Tell them how you killed Lei Gong And then blame the Chicken and Chen Hao Nam You talk nonsense, your gun is pointed at me, it's up to you to say Do you want evidence?

Ding Yao, you must give us San Luen Gang an explanation! The casino is temporarily closed! Misunderstanding between San LuenGang and Hung Hing We will fix later This person, let us bring her back to Taiwan Brother, what are you going to do with her?
