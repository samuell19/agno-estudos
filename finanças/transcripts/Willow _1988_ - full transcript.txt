(THUNDER RUMBLING) (THUNDER RUMBLING) (BABY CRYING) WOMAN 1: Is it a girl? WOMAN 2: Yes. WOMAN 1: Show me its arm. WOMAN 2: She bears the mark. WOMAN 3: No! (SOBBING) (BABY CRYING) The omen is true. I must tell my mother. (SOBBING) Please, help me! WOMAN: I can't. They're going to kill her. (BABY CONTINUES CRYING) Please! Please! (CONTINUES SOBBING) Oh, thank you, Ethna. Thank you. GUARD: Stand aside for Queen Bavmorda! (DOGS BARKING AND SNARLING) You cannot stop the prophecy! This child will have no power over me. Start the ritual. No. No! Where's the baby? The midwife. Find that baby, Sorsha. Use the dogs. Bring her back to me alive! Your reign of terror is at an end! She will come back, and she will finish you! GUARD: Silence, wench. My baby will finish you! Kill her. (DOGS BARKING, HOWLING) (BARKS, HOWLS CONTINUE) (GASPING, PANTING) (DOG BELLOWING) (BABY CRYING) (BARKING CONTINUES) (COOING) (BIRD TWITTERING) (COOS) Dada! Dada! Dada! Dada! Whoa! Whoa! Dada! Dada! We found something in the river. I can't run off and play with you now, Ranon. I've got work to do. You gotta come. Hurry! (CHUCKLES) Come on. Don't go near it. We don't know where it's been. But, Dada, it's a baby. It's not like us. No. It's not a Nelwyn. It looks like a Daikini baby. What's a Daikini? Daikinis are big. Giants who live far away. (LAUGHING) Oh, she's so cute. Can't we keep it, Dada? No! We'll push it downstream and forget we ever saw it. Come on. MAN: Ufgood! Willow Ufgood! Shh! It's the prefect. That's all I need. Keep it quiet. Don't touch it. Mr. Burglekutt, my husband hasn't stolen anything! (GROWLS) Ufgood, you still haven't paid your debts to me. Where did you get these seeds? Well, maybe I used magic. (LAUGHS) You're no sorcerer, Ufgood. You're a clown. I sell the planting seeds around here. Now tell me where you got them. My family's been gathering them in the forest since last fall. There's no law against that, Mr. Burglekutt. (CHILDREN LAUGHING) Willow, you didn't leave them alone by the river? Magic? You'll need magic if you expect to get your planting done before the rains start. I will have this land, Ufgood. And you're gonna end up working in the mines. (BURGLEKUTT GRUNTS) (HOG SNORTING) (GIGGLING) Oh, you're lovely. Yes, you are. (COOS) Kiaya! Oh, Willow! Good girl. Good girl. Absolutely. Under no condition whatsoever is anyone in this family to fall in love with that baby. Yes, you are. Come on, Mims. Come on. Come on. There we are. Come on. Hey, I will not be ignored! Mims? Ranon? (EXHALES) (FUSSING) MIMS: You're gonna be all clean. (BABY GIGGLING) Willow, do you think we should take her to the village council? No. No. They'll think it's a bad omen. There'll be a flood or a drought, and everyone will blame me for it. "Willow Ufgood brought around that Daikini, didn't he?" "That's right. And he's that lousy farmer, too. "Let's get him!" Willow, calm down. Calm down? Kiaya, tomorrow's my big day. Love, the High Aldwin hasn't picked a new apprentice in years. Tomorrow's gonna be different. I just know he's gonna pick me. (CRYING) Here. Hold her. Hey, no. I don't want her, Kiaya. Hold her while I get some milk. Oh, no, no. Oh. (GIGGLING) (SQUEALS) Dada, she likes you. (GIGGLES) (COOING, LAUGHING) (ROOSTER CROWING) Bye. Come on, kids. Let's go. (MIMS GIGGLING) (FESTIVE MUSIC PLAYING) WILLOW: I will now magically join the rings! (MUSIC CONTINUES) Whoa! (LAUGHING) Thank you, son. If you're easily shocked, please turn away. (GASPS) (CROWD EXCLAIMING) (MUSIC CONTINUES) (HONKING) Give me a ripe one. Good. (PIG SQUEALS) And now, for my final amazing feat, I will make this entire pig disappear! (SKEPTICAL GROANS) (SQUEALING) Mims, see? Please, watch very closely. (CHANTING IN OTHER LANGUAGE) (SURPRISED LAUGHTER) Well... What happened to your pig? (PIG SQUEALING) (GASPS) (IN ENGLISH) No! Hey, come here, you! (CROWD LAUGHING) I've seen enough. (LAUGHING) (FANFARE PLAYING) (LOW, DEEP HORN BLOWS) (VILLAGERS CHATTERING) Attention! The High Aldwin will now make his choice for his new apprentice! You'll be all right. You'll be fine. Bring forth the hopefuls. Good luck. Good luck, Dada. Willow Ufgood, a hopeful? How did he get picked? Is this a joke? (GUFFAWS) MAN: Willow? (BURGLEKUTT CONTINUES LAUGHING) Magic is the bloodstream of the universe! Forget all you know, or think you know. All that you require is your intuition. Now, the power to control the world is in which finger? No apprentice this year! (ONLOOKERS GROAN) (FESTIVE MUSIC RESUMES) (CREATURE BELLOWING) (PANICKED SCREAMS) (GROWLING) Where's Mims? I don't know. She was right here! Take Ranon in there, quick! (GROWLING) (CRYING) Mims. (SNARLING) Mims! (ALL SCREAMING) (CRYING) (SNARLING) (GASPS) (CRYING) Mims! I'm scared, Dada! (BABY CRYING) (FEROCIOUS GROWLING) Come on! (DOG SNARLING) (YELLING) Vohnkar! (GROWLS) (DOG WHIMPERS) (MEN GRUNTING) MAN 1: Check to make sure it's not still alive. MAN 2: It's dead! Dada! Dada! It was looking for somebody's baby! (BABY CRYING) Mommy. Kiaya! Kiaya! Kiaya! I'm here. (BABY COOS) (SIGHS IN RELIEF) Oh, Kiaya. (BABY FUSSING) We can't keep the baby, Kiaya. We have to take her to the village council. (VILLAGERS CLAMORING) Silence! One beast we can kill, but there may be more. And you can be assured that they won't give up until they find what they're looking for! MAN 1: It's a sign! MAN 2: Who's to blame for this? MAN 3: We must find the culprit and throw him in the pit! (ALL SHOUTING IN AGREEMENT) VILLAGERS: (CHANTING) Yes! In the pit! In the pit! In the pit! In the pit! In the pit! In the pit! In the pit! Willow. Willow Ufgood. (CHANTING STOPS) Come forward. (VILLAGERS MURMURING) (CHICKEN CLUCKS) WILLOW: My children found this baby alone by the river, High Aldwin. (CRYING) A Daikini child. (VILLAGERS GASPING) That's what the beasts want. Let's give it back to them! VILLAGERS: Yeah! They'll kill her! You can't! It isn't one of us. This child is special! This child must be taken beyond the boundaries of our village. All the way across the great river to the Daikini crossroads. Well, who'll do that? It seems only fair that the man to take this baby to the crossroads be the very man who plucked it out of the river. I nominate Willow Ufgood. (VILLAGERS SHOUT IN AGREEMENT) No! I will consult the bones! The bones tell me nothing. (BABY COOS) Do you have any love for this child? Yes. Yes, I do. The bones have spoken! (VILLAGERS MURMURING) Willow Ufgood, the safety of this village depends upon you. Praise the bones! VILLAGERS: Praise the bones! HIGH ALDWIN: But you will need help. Who has the courage to protect our brave fellow on his journey? I'll go with him. Ah, Meegosh. Excellent choice. I'll go! VILLAGERS: (SHOUTING) Vohnkar! Vohnkar! No! Not Vohnkar! He's the best warrior in the village! We need him here! Vohnkar, step back! All this expedition needs is a leader. And according to the bones, that leader is you, Burglekutt! Vohnkar! What's your problem, son? How do you mean? When I held up my fingers, what was your first impulse? Well, it was stupid. Just tell me. To pick my own finger. A-ha! That was the correct answer. You lack faith in yourself. More than anyone in the village, you have the potential to be a great sorcerer. Now, when you're out there, listen to your own heart. These will protect you. Acorns? They're magic! Anything you throw them at turns to stone. You have much to learn, young Ufgood. MIMS: Are you scared, Dada? No! Even with fairies in the woods that'll put you to sleep for a hundred years? Doesn't bother me. Brownies? Dragons? Trolls? Trolls that'll skin you alive and take your face off? Ranon! You know I hate trolls. I can be your guard and carry your spear. Me, too. Me, too, Dada. What a lucky father I am. I wish I could take you bobbins with me. Goodbye, Dada. Go play! Go on. We've never been apart. I miss you already. Don't worry, Kiaya. I'll be fine. I'll be back before you know it. Well, remember to keep her warm. And here. This will bring you luck. Good brave people! The outer world is no place for a Nelwyn. Give the baby to the first Daikini you see, then hurry home. (CHANTING IN OTHER LANGUAGE) HIGH ALDWIN: (IN ENGLISH) Go in the direction the bird is flying! It's going back to the village! Ignore the bird. Follow the river. Move out! (FUSSING) Hold on, Meegosh. What's wrong? We have to stop. Stop? Why? The baby's sick. (BAWLING) She's not sick! Let me see. (RETCHES) Take her! Take her! (LAUGHING) (BURGLEKUTT GROANING) She'll be fine once she gets some rest. (COOING) (GROANING) Clean me up. BAVMORDA: I didn't ask you to bring me a dead nursemaid. Sorsha, you're useless! I'm backtracking the nursemaid's trail. I'll find where she hid the baby. Ah, General Kael, at last. KAEL: My queen, I have destroyed the castle at Galladoorn. Well done. But now I have another task for you. Help my daughter to find that tiny, helpless baby that continues somehow to elude her. The baby of the prophecy? The one that would destroy you? I need that baby alive. I must perform the ritual that will exile the child's spirit into oblivion. Find her! I don't need his help, Mother. You'll do as I say, child. SEER: I read the signs. One day, I fear, your daughter will betray you. I trust her loyalty more than I trust yours. (BABY COOING) (BABY SQUEALING) (DOGS BARKING) (MEN SHOUTING) Move! Into the bush. Come on. Move! (HORSE WHINNIES) Come on! (DOGS SNARLING) MAN 1: The Nelwyns have got the baby. We've searched the village. But a group of them are on the road somewhere. MAN 2: They couldn't have gone far! MAN 1: Widen the search and report to Sorsha! (BARKING FADES) (SPUTTERING SIGH) Come. We'll keep to the woods. That's it! It's the crossroads! (DOGS HOWLING IN DISTANCE) VOHNKAR: Keep this fire high. We don't know what's out there. (WHIMPERS) (CREATURE SCREECHING) What was that? Get the spears! (CRYING) (SCREECHING) (GASPS) (GROWLING) (GRUNTING) Give me some water, peck, or you die. Do you understand? Water. Yeah. (GRUNTS, GROANS) Hurry up! Get me some water, you measly little pecks. It's a Daikini. We're in luck. We can't give her to him! Somebody put him there for a reason. Ufgood, we've got to get rid of her. Those soldiers are after us. Shh. He's looking right at us. We've got to give that baby to somebody. I'm somebody. Let me out of here. I'll take care of the baby. (SMOOCHING SOUNDS) I trust him completely. But he tried to strangle me. I want to go home! No, Burglekutt! We should wait! Are you challenging my authority? As far as this baby is concerned, yes. Don't listen to him, Burglekutt. Fine. You stay here alone, but we're going. That's a bad idea. Very bad. Dangerous out there. VOHNKAR: Get the gear, men. Vohnkar. It's not his decision! Burglekutt, you're troll dung. Don't let him talk to you that way, Burglekutt. Listen here, runt. While you're wasting your time here, your fields aren't getting planted. Think about it! Burglekutt, I'm gonna... You're gonna what? (LAUGHS) Someday, Burglekutt. Someday. Vohnkar, let's go! Meegosh, are you coming? I'm staying. (LAUGHS) Come on, men. Burglekutt, let me out of here. I'll take care of the baby. I swear. Just let me out of here. Please! Vohnkar, let me borrow that spear just for a minute. Well, at least get me some water! Burglekutt, don't leave me alone with these two! (FRUSTRATED GRUNT) (BABY CRYING) What'll we do now, Willow? Well, that was really stupid, peck. Don't call me a peck. Oh, I'm sorry, peck. Peck, peck, peck, peck. You be careful! I'm a powerful sorcerer. See this acorn? I'll throw it at you and turn you to stone. Whoo. I'm really scared. No, don't! Don't! There's a peck here with an acorn pointed at me! Oh, I wouldn't want to waste it. Ha! Peck, peck, peck, peck, peck, peck, peck, peck, peck! (INSECTS CHIRPING) (WHINNIES) (BOTH GASPING) MEEGOSH: What was that? Morning, boys. Rough night last night, wasn't it? I don't think I introduced myself yesterday. My name is Madmartigan, and you are, uh... No, Meegosh. Don't go near him. He's dangerous. I am not. (HORSE WHINNIES) Good. Stop! Wait! (HORSE WHINNIES) Whoa! (SCOFFS) What's going on? Smells like a battle. I suppose you're a warrior. I am the greatest swordsman that ever lived. (WILLOW SCOFFS) Say, uh... Could I have some of that water? (SIPS NOISILY) (SOBBING) I don't know why I try. (CONTINUES SOBBING) I guess I am gonna die here. Who cares? Here. Thanks, friend. Oh! (DISTANT RUMBLING) What's that? MADMARTIGAN: I'd say two or three hundred horses, five or six wagons and about a thousand fools. (MADMARTIGAN GRUNTING) Thank you. Oh... Come on, Meegosh. (PANTING) WILLOW: It's gonna be all right, little bobbin. (DRUMS BEATING) (FUSSING) Everything's gonna be all right. (DRUMBEATS CONTINUE) Excuse me, sir. Out of the way, peck! WILLOW: Uh, pardon me. Uh... (DRUMBEATS CONTINUE) Excuse me, sir. We found one of your babies in our village. Will you please take care of her? We're going into battle, little ones. Find a woman to take care of her. They thought you were a woman, Airk. Well... (LAUGHS) Madmartigan! What did you do this time? Nothing you wouldn't have done in my place. AIRK: I always knew you'd end up in a crow's cage. Well, at least I'm not down there herding sheep. What are you doing this far north? The Nockmaar army destroyed Galladoorn. The castle? Bavmorda's troops are crushing everything in sight. Come on. Let me out of here, Airk. Give me a sword. I'll win this war for you. Madmartigan. I still serve Galladoorn. You serve no one. Remember? Sit in your coffin and rot. MADMARTIGAN: Wait, Airk. You need me! (HORSE WHINNIES) I'll be around long after you're dead! When I get out of here, I'm gonna cut your head off and stick it on a pig pole! (BABY FUSSING) I miss Kiaya and the bobbins. We're running out of food. Nobody's gonna take care of that baby. You know why? Nobody cares. Except me. You want to go back to your families. I want out of this cage. Let me take care of that baby. I'll look after her like she was my own. I believe he would, Willow. He doesn't know anything about babies. Right. But I know a lot of women who do. If I had somebody in my life, a little daughter, perhaps, I might have a reason to go on living. You can't leave me in here to die. Not when all I want to do is protect her. (SCREAMS, LAUGHS) I feel better! (LAUGHS) You've done the right thing! Okay. All right. All right. Whoo! You gotta promise to feed her. Come to Daddy, little darling. And keep her clean. Absolutely. (MADMARTIGAN AND BABY GIGGLING) Whee! (BABY SQUEALS) She likes me. (GIGGLES) Here are her changing rags. And her milk bladder. Any milk in there? It's for her! I wouldn't steal from a baby. You worry too much, peck. It's Willow. I mean Willow. Now listen, boys. Willow, you've done the right thing. Now I want you to get home and bring your crop in. Goodbye, little one. Please take good care of her. I give you my word of honor! WILLOW: Meegosh, slow down! Oh, come on! If we hurry, we can be home by tomorrow morning. We'll be heroes. Do you really think so? Sure. "Look, there's Willow and Meegosh. "The heroes have come home." "Welcome back, boys. You deserve medals!" Yeah. Medals. (BOTH LAUGHING) Meegosh. Did we do the right thing? Absolutely. There's nothing to worry about. (BABY CRYING) MAN: Hyah! Ha-ha! I stole a baby! I stole a baby! (LAUGHS) Hyah! That's my baby! (BABY CRYING) Stop! Wait! Come back! MAN: Left, you stupid bird. Left! (LAUGHS) (ARROW TWANGS) (GRUNTS) Ow! Brownies! Let's get out of here! Come on, Meegosh! Ow! (BROWNIES LAUGHING) (BOTH GRUNTING) WILLOW: We'll outrun 'em! (BOTH YELLING) (BROWNIES LAUGHING) Hey, ugly, wake up! (LAUGHING) WILLOW: Huh? (GRUNTS, GROANS) Stand your ground. He's our prisoner. Where am I? Meegosh, where's the baby? CHERLINDREA: Bring the Nelwyns to me. All right, you heard her! What's going on? Shut up, or I'll break your nose. You are mine to toy with. Forward! Get the rope. (ALL GRUNTING) Come on. Where... Where did you get that baby? I stole it from a stupid Daikini. (LAUGHS) CHERLINDREA: Franjean, release the Nelwyns. And stop pestering them. Uh-oh. (MUTTERING) (ROPE POPS) (SHOUTS) (SHOUTING, LAUGHING) CHERLINDREA: Welcome to my kingdom. (KISSES) I'm so happy to meet you, Willow Ufgood. WILLOW: How do you know my name? Elora Danan told me. Elora? Elora, Willow is here. But she's just a baby. She's very special. My Brownies have been searching for her ever since we heard she was born. Elora Danan has chosen you to be her guardian. Me? Yes. She likes you. And Elora Danan knows you have the courage to help us. Take my wand to the sorceress Fin Raziel. She will guide you and Elora Danan to the kingdom of Tir Asleen, where a good king and queen will look after her. You need a warrior for a job like this. I'm a nobody. Elora, you don't want me. Tell her. I'm short, even for a Nelwyn. Hello? Elora Danan must survive! She must fulfill her destiny and bring about the downfall of Queen Bavmorda, whose powers are growing like an evil plague. Unless she is stopped, Bavmorda will control the lives of your village, your children, everyone. All creatures of good heart need your help, Willow. The choice is yours. (THUNDER CRACKLING) (WIND WHISTLING) Hey, Meegosh. Wake up. Huh? It's time to go home. Home? Listen, Meegosh. Tell Kiaya I love her. And I think of her every day. Willow... And tell her I'm not going to let anything happen to the baby. Are you sure you know what you're doing? I hope so. Listen, be careful. I know the way, Franjean. You always think you know the way. I am the leader! How long will it take to find this Raziel? FRANJEAN: Not long. ROOL: She's been exiled to an island just over those hills. She's what? Exiled. By the evil Queen Bavmorda. (LAUGHS) Rool, you fool. He does not need to know everything. I didn't tell him everything. You told him enough. What did I say? You mentioned the island. Wait a minute. You mentioned the queen. ROOL: (YELLING) So? What do you mean? What are you saying, mysterious island? Don't play with that wand. Cherlindrea told you, it holds vast powers. Only a great sorcerer can use it, not a stupid peck like you. (LAUGHING) This way. No. No. No. I don't think so. All right, then this way. Eh, nope. This way. This way? That's what I said. This way. You sure you know where you're going? Of course. With us as your guides, no harm will befall you. (THUNDER RUMBLING) (ELORA FUSSING) MAN: Take it up! We are not going in there! But Elora needs fresh milk. And we are drenched. You are not in command, shorty. I am! You hear me? Whoa! (LIVELY MUSIC PLAYING) (GLASS BREAKING) (CROWD YELLING) (MAN LAUGHING) Excuse me? Excuse me. (LAUGHING) Could you spare some milk for this poor hungry baby? Get out of here, peck! Get out of here or we'll cook ya! ROOL: Ooh, look at her! I could use a love potion on her! Franjean! Hey! Give me that dust of broken heart. Come on! Give it to me! It's very dangerous. It belongs to the fairies! (GROWLS, SNEEZES) (YELLS) (THUMPS) Hey, quiet! You want to get us killed? (SNEEZES) (GRUNTS) FRANJEAN: Oh, Rool! Always playing with those fairy love potions. (MEOWING) (SIGHING DEEPLY) You are so beautiful! (MEOWS) Your eyes! Your whiskers! I have to kiss you! Rool! That dust of broken heart! (MEOWS) (ROOL SCREAMS) (PANTING, GRUNTING) Beer! (LAUGHS) These people are crazy! This could be bad! WOMAN: Hurry! Hurry! My husband's coming! If he catches you here, he'll kill us both! How do I look? Cover your face up! Not you! Where the hell did you come from? I knew I shouldn't have trusted you. Don't I know you? I stole the baby from you, Daikini, while you were taking a pee-pee! Cover your face! You are crawling with Brownies. (SHRIEKS) I hate Brownies! (FRANJEAN LAUGHING) Whoa! Where is he? Where? WOMAN: Hello, dear. There's nobody here but me and, uh, my, uh... I'll kill him! ...my cousin, Hilda. Hilda? WOMAN: Hilda. Hilda! This is my husband, Llug. (IN WOMAN'S VOICE) Mmm. Big husband. WOMAN: Yes. MADMARTIGAN: How do you do? (LAUGHING) LLUG: Hilda! Ooh. Come on, girly. Don't be shy. Hey! Give her back! Pecks make terrible nursemaids. Nursemaid? They get too excited. (GRUNTS) Excuse me! Are we having a party? Huh? Hey, hey, hey, hey! (LAUGHING LEWDLY) Stop, please. Ooh. Come on. Fight like a man! (GRUNTS) Want to breed? Tempting, but no. (GROWLING) Thank you. Time to leave. Bye, Hilda! SOLDIER: Take them out. (ALL GASPING) Hey! Come along! MADMARTIGAN: Careful, you lout! Move along! SOLDIER: Gather up all these babies. SORSHA: That baby over there. Let me see its arm. (CROWD CLAMORING) That's not the one. You! Are you the mother of that child? (IN WOMAN'S VOICE) Yes. Yes, I am. Let me see it. No! Don't let her! Aah! I gave you an order, woman! (GRUNTS) You're... You're beautiful. And you're very strong. Thank you. You're no woman! Now, honey, take it easy. Not a woman? (IN NORMAL VOICE) Gentlemen... Not a woman! Meet Llug. (GROWLS) After them! Out of the way! To the horses! Hyah! (WHINNIES) Madmartigan! Madmartigan! Wait! (GRUNTING, GROANING) LLUG: He's not a woman! (HORSE WHINNYING) (SHOUTS) SOLDIER: Don't let them get away! Madmartigan, stop! (WHIMPERING) (GRUNTING, GROANING) Madmartigan, I'm warning you... Ow! Prepare to die! Whoa! (GRUNTS) (GROANS) Madmartigan! Stop! (BOTH GRUNTING) No more beer. (GASPS) (GROANING) Franjean, help me! Rool! Help! Rool! Rool. Rool! What are you doing? Help me! (GRUNTING) Come on. I am. Pull me in. ROOL: Yeah, pull! (SQUEALS) (HORSE WHINNIES) You can't have her! Whoa! (GRUNTS) Rool, this isn't funny! Help me cut the rope! (GRUNTING) Whoa! (LAUGHING, CHEERING) MADMARTIGAN: Willow, stay down! Whoa! Whoa! Have you gone crazy? WILLOW: You can't chase around with Elora like this. We're getting off! Hyah! Hyah! (YELLING) (MEN GROANING) Whoa! Whoa! (GRUNTING, GROANING) Oh, Rool. (GRUNTS) Now we stop, peck. Stupid Daikini. Ask him to stop the wagon. Madmartigan! You never, ever drive that fast with an infant! I just saved that infant's life! (URGING HORSES) FRANJEAN: Gather your wits. Come on. ROOL: Don't worry about me. I'm fine! Come on! (HOOFBEATS APPROACHING) Get down! ROOL: Uh, where am I? Oh! Rool, you fool, get out of the road! (GROANS, GRUNTS) (DOGS BARKING) (BARKING CONTINUES) ROOL: Ah, Franjean! You better clear out, Willow. Before those troops come back. ROOL: Ah, my head! We don't need him, Elora. (CRYING) WILLOW: Madmartigan, wait! Go home, Willow! It's a dangerous world. Yeah, and that's why we need your help. My help? (SCOFFS) What do you need my help for? You're a sorcerer! You're a great warrior and a swordsman. And you're ten times bigger than I am, stupid! Are you trying to make my life more difficult than it already is? (DOGS BARKING) (GASPS) (BARKING CONTINUES) Hurry! Big dogs! Look. I'm sorry I got angry. We wouldn't have escaped without you. (COOING) Well, don't expect me to help you again. Good! Then we go that way! To the lake! That way. You are drunk, and when you are drunk, you forget that... I am in charge! You are in charge. Fine. Then which way do we go? That way! That way! (CROW CAWING) Oh, no! That's the way I'm going. All right, all right. You can follow me as far as the lake. But that's it! You're not going south, are you? No, just as far as the lake. Good. Mumbo. Jumbo. I am hungry. Go get me some eggs or something. We are not afraid of you! Now! (BOTH SHRIEKING) (THUNDER RUMBLING) Kael, have you found the child? The search goes on, my queen. Why, with my powers, with the strength of my great army, can you not find one little child? We look even now. It won't be long. Find the child. Find the child! Time is running out. Good night. She is kind of cute. When she's quiet. She's really a princess. Really? And you're a great sorcerer. And I'm the king of Kashmir. Go to sleep, Willow. Good night, Madmartigan. ROOL: Rats! Big rats! Rats! (GRUNTS) Rats! Rat... Rool, you and that stupid rat dream! (CHANTING IN OTHER LANGUAGE) (SCREAMS) Huh? Willow? Willow? Oh. (YAWNING) There you are. Madmartigan! (YAWNING) Night, Willow. (BIRDS SQUAWKING) ROOL: This way! This way! (ELORA COOING) What are you doing? I found some black root. She loves it! Black root? I am the father of two children, and you never, ever give a baby black root. Well, my mother raised us on black root. It's good for ya! It puts hair on your chest. Doesn't it, Sticks? Her name is not Sticks. She's Elora Danan, the future empress of Tir Asleen. And the last thing she's gonna want is a hairy chest! (ELORA WHIMPERING) MADMARTIGAN: Did you see what he did? He stole our black root. I'll get some more. Don't worry about it. There it is! The island! (BOTH LAUGHING) We made it. FRANJEAN: We have led you to the island of the sorceress Fin Raziel. We'll get a boat in that village. A big boat. (CHUCKLES) Well, looks like I got you here. You! What did you do? All you did was hang around and eat our eggs! Huh? I found a boat. We're all set. Good. Take these two lizards out and drown them. Lizards! Who are you calling lizards? (GROWLING, YAPPING) ROOL: Your mother was a lizard! MADMARTIGAN: Goodbye, Sticks. (FUSSING) If you really are a princess, take care of him. (ELORA CRYING) Madmartigan! What? Thanks. Hey! Aah! (SPITTING) ROOL: Keep walking, hero! Don't even turn around! (CRIES) It's all right, Elora. (THUNDER RUMBLING) Go to sleep. Nobody'll find you here. I'll be back with Fin Raziel very soon. We will guard her with our meager lives. (DISTANT THUNDER CONTINUES) Raziel! Fin Raziel! I have to talk to you, please! Raziel! She's not here. (SCREECHING) Aah! (HIGH, SQUEAKY VOICE) Get back! Who are you? Who are you? I'm Willow Ufgood. What are you doing here? I've come to find the great sorceress, Fin Raziel. That's me! I'm Raziel! This can't be right! One of Bavmorda's spells transformed me. Believe me, it could have been worse! Well, this wand is for you. It's from Cherlindrea. Then the prophecy is true. The princess has been born. Take me to her. It is Elora Danan. Isn't she beautiful? (CHUCKLING) Isn't she beautiful? That's Raziel? I don't know. I expected something more grand. Less, uh... Fuzzy. Fuzzy! You must use the wand. Turn me back into my human form. What do I do? You mean you're not a sorcerer? Yes. Sorta. I'm a farmer. (BOTH SIGHING IN DISGUST) But I do know a few tricks. Tricks? Cherlindrea sent you? You must learn real magic. (HORSE WHINNYING) Horses! Horses! RAZIEL: Quick! Take her! Hurry! Hurry! (GASPS) FRANJEAN: I knew he was a traitor! Sorry about this, peck. Keep your mouth shut! (GROANS) Told you we'd find him without your help. Give me that baby. No! (ELORA CRYING) Give her back! (SHRIEKS) Leave me alone! Don't touch me! (HORSE WHINNIES) This is the one we're looking for. We must take it back to Nockmaar. (CHITTERING) Lose your skirt? I've still got what counts. Not for long. (GROANS) Bring him. Over here! (GRUNTING) (PANTING, GRUNTING) We'll never keep up with those horses. Then we will have to track them. That would take forever. Besides, even if we find them, they'll catch us, stick us in cages, torture us and finally devour us. Are you suggesting we go home? No. This is more fun! All right. Fine, then. Come on! (THUNDER RUMBLING) (HORSE WHINNIES) (ELORA CRYING) I'm worried about Elora. She doesn't sound good. Hurry! Practice the chant I taught you! (CHANTING IN OTHER LANGUAGE) (IN ENGLISH) I can't remember the middle part. Locktwaar! That's the word that pleads for change. Locktwaar. Elora's cold and hungry. She knows me. Please, let me take care of her. I don't need help from a peck. (CRYING CONTINUES) (THUNDER RUMBLING) What are you staring at? Your leg. I'd like to break it. You may find that difficult, slave, while I'm up here and you're down there. I hate that woman. (GROANING) SORSHA: Hyah! I found it, Kael. (ELORA CRYING) That should make my mother happy. What are they gonna do to her? (DOGS HOWLING) (PANTING, GROWLING) (WILLOW CHANTING IN OTHER LANGUAGE) (SNIFFING) That's magic? Smells terrible. It's the life spark. It forms after... Well, it stinks! This whole thing stinks! Ignore him, Willow. He's a fool! If only I had a sword! (GRUNTS) If only you'd quit talking about it. Willow, you must transform me to my human self. But, Raziel, I'm not ready yet. You'd better be. Get me down. (GRUNTS) (SQUEALS) Ow! (GROANS) Why don't you help me get out of here instead of chattering with that muskrat? Muskrat! When I change back to my former self, I will crush this army, and take Elora Danan to Tir Asleen, where she will be safe. (CHOMPING) Ow! What'd you bite me for? You need three drops of your blood to put in the potion. Well, you could've warned me. (SCOFFS) For beginners, there's some pain, but don't let anything break your concentration. (CHANTING IN OTHER LANGUAGE) Hello, everybody! We have arrived! You are saved. BOTH: Shh! RAZIEL: Don't interrupt. (CHANTING IN OTHER LANGUAGE) What are you gonna look like if this works? Don't interrupt. Sorry. (CHANTING IN OTHER LANGUAGE) I am a young, beautiful woman. Concentrate, Willow. (CHANTING IN OTHER LANGUAGE) RAZIEL: No! You're losing me! (STRETCHING SOUND) (CONTINUES CHANTING) (RAZIEL WHIMPERING) (GROANS) You all right? Nice try, Willow. (BIRD CAWING) RAZIEL: Farmers! Cherlindrea sends me farmers! The Nelwyn really butchered that one. I'm sorry, Raziel. You want out? Easy. We can pick a lock. Come on. No. No, no. Like this! I know what I'm doing. It's my spear. Leave it alone. Let me do it. Out of the way, rodents. FRANJEAN: Take your hand off that. You leave that alone, you stupid, fat Daikini! Ow! (LAUGHING) Dust of broken hearts. (GRUNTS) (SIGHS DEEPLY) (BOTH GRUNTING) Ha, ha! There. You are free! Come on, Madmartigan. Let's get Elora Danan out of here. Yeah. It'll be fun. Come on! Are you all right? Yeah. I feel good. The dust of broken hearts. Uh... Come on! ROOL: Let me see! You always see. FRANJEAN: Let me see. There's Elora, right there, on those furs. (FUSSING) FRANJEAN: Hey, wait! Leave this to us. It's too dangerous for you. Only one of us should go in there. I've had experience in this sort of thing. I know what I'm doing. BOTH: Uh-oh. (WHISPERING) Wait. Shh! No! No! I love you. WILLOW: Madmartigan! What are you doing? Take the baby and go! Come on! Come on! Oh, Sorsha. (GROANS) (BOTH GROANING) Wake from this hateful sleep. It deprives me of your beauty. The beauty of your eyes... One move, jackass, and you really will be a woman. You are my sun! My moon! My starlit sky. Without you, I dwell in darkness. I love you. What are you doing here? Your power has enchanted me. I stand helpless against it. Come to me, now. Tonight, let me worship you in my arms. Get away from me! I love you! Stop saying that! How can I stop the beating of my heart? It pounds like never before. Out of fear. Out of love! I can stop it. I'll kill you. Death, next to love, is a trivial thing. Your touch is worth 100,000 deaths. What goes on here? (ELORA CRYING) Deceiver! KAEL: Stop him! (MAN GROANS) KAEL: Captain, get up! (ALL YELLING) You are great. (CHUCKLES, GRUNTS) Get on that shield! (GRUNTS) Sorsha! After them! (GROANS, SCREAMS) (BARKING, GROWLING) Whoa! Hey! (BOTH SCREAMING) MAN: They're getting away! Follow me, Rool. I don't know. Where are you? (GRUNTING) Oh, no, where did everybody go? Maybe it was something we said. (MADMARTIGAN SCREAMS) (BOTH SCREAMING) (MOANING) (MOANING, GROANING) (LAUGHING) (SCREAMS) (SCREAMS) (SCREAMING) (CLATTERING) (CHICKENS CLUCKING) (ELORA GIGGLING) Madmartigan! (COW MOOS) Madmartigan! What the hell happened up there? You started spouting poetry. Poetry? Yeah. "I love you, Sorsha. I worship you, Sorsha." You almost got us killed! "I love you, Sorsha"? I don't love her. She kicked me in the face. I hate her! Don't I? (CAWING) Kael! Kael! Nockmaar soldiers! MAN: Hide! Get the children! Come on! Go on, hide! Get the children! They're after us! We need a place to hide. Come on. Follow me. Quick! Come on! Move! I knew you'd get out of that rat trap. You left me to die, Airk. I probably saved your life. We were slaughtered, and I lost a lot... Shh! Quiet! (HORSE WHINNYING) KAEL: Tear this village apart! Look everywhere! Find the child! (CRYING) (CAWING, IMITATING BABY) (SHUSHING) (SHUSHING) (SOLDIERS SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY) KAEL: Tell Sorsha I search the north bank! (KAEL GRUNTS) SOLDIER: Yes, General. Quiet. (SHUSHING) (FUSSING) (SORSHA SCREAMS, GRUNTS) Sorsha! Back. Back! Back! Keep the baby quiet. She needs to be changed. Nockmaar scum! You'll never defeat us. Give up the baby! Shut up! What does Bavmorda want with this baby, anyway? WILLOW: She's a princess. We're taking her to Tir Asleen. Tir Asleen? Even if you could find it, peck, she's right. You'd never get past the Nockmaar army. There's an even bigger army at Tir Asleen. If we can just get there... (WOMAN SCREAMING) I've lost more than half my men fighting Bavmorda. Now you and this peck are gonna take her on? You always told me you served no one, Madmartigan. Since when are you a crusader? He's not gonna help you, peck. He's a worthless thief. I'm not a thief, Airk. He's not a thief. Are you? I serve the Nelwyn, Airk. Want to come with us? You'll never make it, Madmartigan. Then once again we say goodbye. (CLAMORING) (GROANING) Over here! Sorsha! Weapons down or she's dead! Hyah! Hyah! LIEUTENANT: Get to your horses! After 'em! (SCREAMING) (CAWING) RAZIEL: This way! This way! As the crow flies, you fools! You're holding me too tight! I don't want you to get away. Why? Because I'm "your sun, your moon, your starlit sky"? Get your hair out of my face, or I'll chop it off. Did I really... Did I really say those things last night? In your tent? You said you loved me. I don't remember that. You lied to me! No, I... I just wasn't myself last night. I suppose my power enchanted you, and you were helpless against it. Sort of. Then what? It went away. It went away? "I dwell in darkness without you," and it went away? Yeah. (GRUNTS) (MADMARTIGAN ROARS) (SHOUTS) (GRUNTS) Whoa. (SORSHA PANTING) RAZIEL: Hurry! Kael's coming! (SQUAWKS) (GRUNTING, GROANING) Madmartigan, come on! Now! (GROANING) (COUGHS) Madmartigan, come on! RAZIEL: They're coming! Away! WILLOW: Go on! Hyah! (YELLS) KAEL: Whoa! Whoa! This way! This way! (ALL URGING HORSES) RAZIEL: Tir Asleen! At last, Tir Asleen! MADMARTIGAN: Hello? (WIND WHISTLING) Hello? Hello? Why did I listen to you, peck? "Everything will be all right once we get to Tir Asleen." The only army around here is the one that's about to ride across this valley and wipe us out! But Cherlindrea said we'd be safe here. "Safe"? Look at these people. This place is cursed, peck. It's falling apart. Open your eyes! And it... (ELORA COOS) Trolls. I hate trolls. RAZIEL: This is the work of Bavmorda. (ELORA GRUNTS) RAZIEL: Willow? The wand. Turn me back into my human form. Are you sure? (LAUGHS) Yeah. Good. RAZIEL: Hurry, Willow. Transform me. I can't do it. I'm just not a sorcerer. But you can be. Speak, and be one with the words. (CHANTING IN OTHER LANGUAGE) (CAWING) RAZIEL: Oh, Willow, you're losing me. (HORSES WHINNY) (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) Madmartigan, Kael's coming! RAZIEL: Willow, you idiot. Raziel? Willow, arm that catapult up there. (GRUNTING) (GRUNTING) (LAUGHING) ALL: Whoa! Whoa! RAZIEL: Good work, Madmartigan. What the hell happened to you? KAEL: Assault! Sorsha, battering ram! SORSHA: Cut it down! Faster! KAEL: Forward! Break it down! (GROWLS) KAEL: Again! Again! (GROWLING) RAZIEL: Willow, use the wand on that troll. (GROWLING) (SPEAKS OTHER LANGUAGE) (SCREAMING) (GROWLING) Ew! (GRUNTS) KAEL: Break it down! Forward! (SHOUTING) (YELLS) (YELLING) ALL: Whoa! Whoa! (HORSE WHINNIES) (GASPS) (ROARING) KAEL: Get him! (ALL SHOUTING) (ROARING) (WILLOW YELLS) The other side! (SCREAMING) KAEL: Destroy the beast! Find the baby! RAZIEL: (BLEATS) Take that! (GROWLING) (GROWLING) (CRYING) (GROWLING) (SCREAMING) WILLOW: Oh! (CRYING) (ROARING) (SCREAMING) (WILLOW GRUNTING) (ROARING) (BOTH GRUNT) (GROANS) Willow! (GROWLING) (GRUNTS) Oh! (GRUNTING) WILLOW: Madmartigan, help! Willow! Get him, Madmartigan! (GROWLING) (GROWLING) (YELLING) Here. (ROARING) (SIGHS) (YELLS) SOLDIER: The baby! (BOTH YELLING) (KAEL YELLING) (LAUGHING) (GASPS SOFTLY) (YELLS, GRUNTS) (GROWLING) (SOLDIERS GROAN) (SOLDIER SCREAMING) Airk's army. Get Kael! MAN: Airk's army! FRANJEAN: We are here! ROOL: You are rescued! Charge! Charge! (HORSE WHINNIES) (KAEL GRUNTS) (CRYING) KAEL: No mercy! Elora! (SNIFFLES) Willow! (WHIMPERS) Elora's gone. Willow. They've taken her. There were too many of them. (SOBBING) Willow. Can you ride? Let's ride. KAEL: I have the child! (YELLS) (CHATTERING) We need towers and a battering ram! Break out the tents! Make camp! Make camp! (LAUGHING) We'll assault at first light. (ELORA FUSSING) Where's Sorsha? She has turned against us, Your Highness. Turned against me? (ELORA CRYING) Prepare for the ritual! (HORSE WHINNIES) (CHATTERING) (LAUGHING) (LAUGHTER CONTINUES) This is not an army. (LAUGHING) RAZIEL: Willow, quick, hide. Use the shelter chant. Protect yourself. Why? Just do it. We've come for Elora Danan. BAVMORDA: You dare to challenge me? You're not warriors. You're pigs! (GROANS) (BAVMORDA CHANTING IN OTHER LANGUAGE) (SQUEALING) (GROANING) You're all pigs! (GROANING) Pigs! Pigs! (GROANING) (WHINNIES) (YELLING) (SNORTING) (CHANTING IN OTHER LANGUAGE) (SQUEALING) (LAUGHS) MADMARTIGAN: Sorsha! Mother, no! (SPEAKS OTHER LANGUAGE) (GROANS) (GIGGLES) (SQUEALING, OINKING) (CHANTING IN OTHER LANGUAGE) (CRYING) Begin the ritual. This baby will not destroy me. (CRYING CONTINUES) (THUNDER RUMBLES) Come, thunder! Come, lightning! Touch this altar with your powers. (CRYING) (OINKING) (GROANS) We've come all this way, and now Elora Danan's gonna die! No, we can still defeat Bavmorda. She's too powerful, Raziel. Transform me and I will destroy her. Elements of eternity, above and below. Balance of essence, fire beget snow. (CHANTING IN OTHER LANGUAGE) RAZIEL: Willow, believe in the words. Concentrate. (GROANS) (WILLOW CONTINUES CHANTING) RAZIEL: Oh, no! (GROANS) Don't give up, Willow! Oh, Willow! (CONTINUES CHANTING) (GROWLS) Raziel. (EXHALES) Has it been so long? I'm sorry. Willow, we have work to do. Give me the wand. We must undo Bavmorda's sorcery. Let them in now. (THUNDER RUMBLES) (CHANTING IN OTHER LANGUAGE) (CRYING) BAVMORDA: Black fires forever kindled within, let the second rite begin. (THUNDER RUMBLES) GUARD: Quick, inside. That won't reach the wall. We can't get inside. SORSHA: Elora Danan will die. RAZIEL: Unless we save her. Bavmorda's too powerful. RAZIEL: No! She cannot transform you again. My spell is protecting this camp. But can your magic get us inside the fortress? We can't do it. Wait. Back home in my village, we have a lot of gophers. Willow, this is war, not agriculture. I know, I know. But I have an idea how to get inside the castle. (THUNDER RUMBLES) (CHANTING IN OTHER LANGUAGE) (THUNDER RUMBLES) Come on, Madmartigan, you and I are soldiers. You know the peck's plan will never work. If the baby dies, all hope for the future is lost. I'm going to fight. Me, too. All right, we've got to decide who's gonna go and who's gonna stay. (CHATTERING) Raziel. Willow, all these years I have waited to face Bavmorda. It is you that has made this possible. Whatever happens, I shall always admire you. Your children will come to remember this day. We call upon you to surrender! We are all-powerful sorcerers. Give us the baby, or we'll destroy you! (LAUGHING) Kill them! (GATE OPENING) (SOLDIERS SHOUTING) Patience, Willow. Courage, Willow. (SHOUTING) (YELLING) (SOLDIERS SHOUTING, WHOOPING) (YELLS) SOLDIER: Whoa! Back to the castle! (YELLING) (ALL YELLING) (BAVMORDA CHANTING IN OTHER LANGUAGE) (IN ENGLISH) Exile the child to the 13th night. (ELORA CRYING) This way! (YELLING) (ALL GRUNTING) (YELLING) (SCREAMING) (BAVMORDA CHANTING IN OTHER LANGUAGE) (ELORA CONTINUES CRYING) It's all right, Willow. You don't have to go. BAVMORDA: (IN ENGLISH) Light the 13th candle! Raziel. Mother! I... Traitor child. I must despise you now. (YELLING) (SCREAMS) I won't let you kill that child. Away! (CHANTING IN OTHER LANGUAGE) (GRUNTING) (GRUNTS) Your powers have gained in strength, Raziel. I have Cherlindrea's wand, Bavmorda. Elora Danan will be queen. (GRUNTING) (SCREAMS) (BOTH LAUGHING) KAEL: Now you die! (YELLING) (SPEAKS OTHER LANGUAGE) (YELLING) (CHANTING IN OTHER LANGUAGE) (YELLING INDISTINCTLY) (SCREAMING) (GROANS) (LAUGHING) (YELLING) (GASPS) (YELLING INDISTINCTLY) (BOTH GRUNTING) Yikes!

(SPEAKS OTHER LANGUAGE) (ELORA WHIMPERS) Bring back that child, peck. (CRYING) Who are you? (THUNDER RUMBLES) I'm Willow Ufgood. I'm a great sorcerer. (CHUCKLING) Greater than Raziel. (CHUCKLING LOUDER) Greater than you even. I'm the greatest sorcerer! (LAUGHING) Is that the extent of your powers, little one? (GASPS) Now, you will watch me draw upon the power of the universe to send that child into the netherworld. Now place it on the altar! (ELORA WHIMPERING) No! "No"? You stupid hag! With my magic, I'll send her into the... Into a... (LAUGHS) You're no sorcerer. Into a realm where evil cannot touch her. Impossible! There's no such place! (CHANTING IN OTHER LANGUAGE) You're a fool! I shall destroy you and the child with you. You're a fool! Nockmaar... Goodbye, Elora. (CHANTING IN OTHER LANGUAGE) (GASPS) (GROANS) Impossible! (GROANING) You... (DISTORTED SCREAMING) (SIGHS) Willow, where's the baby? It was just my old disappearing-pig trick. (RAZIEL LAUGHING) Oh, well done! Oh! Willow Ufgood, receive this book of magic. You are on your way to becoming a great sorcerer. Willow the Sorcerer! You make us proud! (LAUGHING) (ELORA CHUCKLES) Goodbye, Elora Danan. Hey. FRANJEAN: Goodbye, Willow! Farewell! FRANJEAN: Eh? (SQUEALS) (CHEERING) Willow! Willow! Hello. Willow's back! Willow's back! Willow! Willow! Willow's back! WOMAN: Willow! Willow Ufgood! Willow! Hey, Meegosh! WOMAN: It's a bird! He made a bird! (GROANS) Kiaya! Willow? Kiaya. Willow! Willow! Kiaya! Kiaya. Dada! Dada! Dada, I missed you! WILLOW: Oh, I missed you. Good to see you. Good, good to see you.
