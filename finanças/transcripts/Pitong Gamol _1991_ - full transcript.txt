It’s like this. You’re still small, you don’t even have pants. There’s a woman that went to our house, Then left you there. My mom adopted you. We grew up together. Sometime I woke up in the morning, my mom was gone. What happened to me? You still don’t have pants. You really! That’s it! A rich person supposed to adopt me, But it did not happen. Why? When they knew that my grandfather’s a thief, My dad’s a thief. They thought their child will also be thief. Right. What are you now? Pick pocketer? Shameless! It’s hard to change. Hard to change. Peping, it’s really hard to change. What you need is Hard work, perseverance and a bit of patience. Because hope never disappears. Maybe this might be your first step in changing your life. If you need guidance or help. Don’t be shy to approach me. I will treat you like a blood-relative. Since I don’t have a family. I’m like your close relative. Uncle! Let me free, I’m your relative! Right, uncle! No. A parent diciplines his child, when the child is wrong. Wait! Didn’t you win the race? Yes. So you can pay bail? Yes but we gave the money as payment for the land. Oh my!

No ability in life. If you want, I can kill him. Don’t! You know, I give importance to life. Make a way for him to not be sentenced. Can you not think of any way? I know he has a crush on you.

Okay, hold this. Uncle! Anybody home? - Hello? - Anybody home? - Uncle! - Good evening! Anybody home? What do you need?! We're not gonna fight! Uncle! I'm your nephew! You don't remember me? Sorry, I just woke up. Who are you with? These are my friends. There's still some downstairs. Who are they? They're also with us. And we have a Sergeant with us too. He's been shot. And looks like a syndicate wants to kill him. Syndicate? Your nephew, Ben said, your hideout is nice to hide in. And you're an excellent herbalist. What you've said is right! I can cure any wounds with boiled roots and leaves. Excuse the breakfast my children cooked. Here, have some milk! That's fresh, not evaporated. So you drink carabao's milk? It's delicious because it's fresh. Nice! What's this? That's snail. - Is this edible? - Yes. That's not how you eat it. You suck the shell, or shake it out. Shake it out? Yes. Like this? Hey! You did it intentionally! I didn't mean to! Do you want to start a fight? Uncle! It was an accident! - Is that so? - Yes, why are you angry? Okay, let's continue eating. Anyway, why are you hiding and not facing them? Are you cowards? We really can't fight that syndicate. Those people have no soul. And even if we want to fight, we don't have weapons. - It's true. - Weapons? That's not a problem. Last month, a group of rebels hid here as well. And unexpectedly, after they left, they were ambushed. Everyone died! Then I took all of the guns. Different kinds! I hid it in the house. You can use it. Perfect, we'll tell Sergeant when he's well. We'll use it, and we'll fight. Righ! But we'll take care of this fight first. This one really. Daughters! While Sergeant is recuperating, take care of the guests. Leave them to us dad. I want to thank the seven of you. For saving my life from death. I also want to thank Mister Kulas, and his three beautiful daughters for accepting us with open arms and giving these weapons. That we will use in our fight. Before we start our training, I want you to know that this is dangerous. I might die, or even the death of us. But! This is your chance to do good. Now! Who'll go with me? Him! Me! I will go with you Sergeant! Because I believe in your principle! I may grew up without parents, but I have a teacher that taught me principles should be fought for! And love your own country more than you love yourself! Sergeant! I'll go with you! Good! Thank you. Now! Who else will join me? Still him! Only me? You won't join? I will not blame you if that's your decision. Even if it's just the two of us, we'll still continue the mission. Yes. You can go home. - Jun, take care! - Thank you! You left me, you animals! Okay, Jun. Annoying! Sergeant. Hey! Join us. Sergeant, even is it's just the two of us, we'll still fight. Yes, we'll fight. Sergeant! We'll join you! One! Two! One! Two! One! Two! One! Two! Ouch! Are they sexy? The reason why I covered your eyes is to teach you to shoot your opponents even in the dark. With the help of sharp senses and smell. Okay? Ready! Good! Another one. Good! You pass on the senses. Now! Let's train your sense of smell. Come on! Come on! Move! Come on! - That's it! - Ouch. - Hey! Faster! There! - Yes! There! Sergeant, what is this for? It's for that one! Sergeant, what is this for? It's for that one! Tie it well. Sir, what is this for? What's that? Pee! Bring it over there! - Sergeant! - Yes? Why do we need to do this? We won't be seen by the enemies, because we're at the seventh mountain. - Sir, question! - What is it? Can we make this into chicken stew? Don't! Don't you know that chickens will be our EWD. What's EWD? Early Warning Device. Search every mountain for Dimabili, then kill him. Madonna, why do we still need to find Dimabili? He's hiding already and he will not show himself because he's scared of you. Why do you contradict everything I say? It's not like that. I just want to say is, if it's unnecessary, why do we still need to kill a person? Because as long as Dimabilli is alive, we are in danger! Stupid! What is it? Okay, go ahead! Right on the butt! You have no shame! You still scared us! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Bro, wait, pull this! Pull it bro! It's smelly! Nice! Why are we retreating? We're not going to fight. What you're doing is a hindrance to us! I’m sorry Mister Kulas. The syndicate I fought is kind of strong. They have no mercy. You and your three children might be in danger. But I think my children will really be in danger. Before they used to be with me, now they're with others! Hey! Children, be careful! You all are like epoxy with how you stick to those men! Your eyes are really different when you're in love. This is not different because of love! What? It's because of drowsiness! Hey! Don't sleep! Look at the road! Yes! We've been driving for awhile now. We still haven't arrived to our destination. We're still far! Far? Are you sure? This road is so long. Is there really a curve? There is! At the end. Just go straight! - You're sure? - Yes! Okay, tell me where to turn. Yes. Hey! Don't sleep! We might crash! Look at the road! Look at it! Look at the road! Open your eyes! There! Look at the road! Don't wander your eyes! Look at the road! Damn! These nipa huts here are tall, aren't they? Won't we get dizzy if we go up there? No. Because you're used to the province. It’s because you only know trees. Commander! Do you think the syndicate will not find us here? You said their nose are like dogs. Maybe not. Because I only know this place. - But we still should be careful. - Yes. - Hey! - Ouch, who’s that? - What are you doing? - Sergeant! Stop that, it’s hopeless. There’s no engine. Sergeant, that’s what I’m studying. How to operate this without an engine! - What? - Yes! Operate without engine? Yes Sergeant! Hey you’re different! You will see! Oh you're fighting back? I love you. We must make a move. First step! Infiltration! And to be able to infiltrate, We need to follow Gayla. So we can pin point the syndicate’s hideout! Sergeant is right. And because of the infiltration, I invented two mini microphones. Not only two but many. So we can bug, tap, and survey what the syndicate is talking about. And I need a handsome man. Me again?! Don’t I have any role here aside from using my handsome face? I'm sorry, I need two. Let him go also. - He’s only second to me. - Why me? Okay. Because there are beautiful ladies involved in the syndicate. You need this. Both of you. Love potion. Love potion? I don’t need this. You need this. What? Wait. You need it more. I don’t need this. No, you need this. No need. I don’t need that. You need it. You need this. Wait Sergeant! Hey, Jun! Wait, Sergeant! You’re not my type! Now you all know! Okay! Where’s ma’am? Upstairs, Kabo. Why? Here’s the car she asked to buy. Will she take long? Yes. Where can we wait? At the bar. Come with us and drink. It’s settled! What’s the plan? You there. - Here? - Yes. I'll go here. Okay. Take care. Ma’am, here’s your orange juice. The cucumber I asked you to bring? Here. Wait. Wait. Please help me. Okay. Okay slowly. There. Please put it. Close your eyes. Cucumber! There. And cucumber. Okay. Luningning? Luningning? I thought you left already. Where’s my sponge? Come rub me. This? Oh this. Rub my leg. What happened to you? You’re like being electrocuted there. What? My hands feel sweaty. Press harder, I can’t feel anything. It’s like you’re not used to this. What am I doing? What are you saying? It’s like you have malaria. The water is cold. Stop that. Do the other side! What are you doing? You’re tickling me. Do my back. Give my juice. You’re so slow, my arms are getting numb. Give my juice. Here. Who are you? What are you doing here, midget? Andrew, come over here. Over here. I like it. Okay. Disgusting! Where’s Ambo? Oh handsome! Don’t come near me. I will shoot you. I will shoot you. Stop! Chase after him! It exploded! He’s dead! His body was exploded into pieces! I didn’t even see his corpse. Ambo is dead! What are we gonna do, Jun? - Jun, what are we gonna do? - Shut up! Let’s be brave! I know he’s still with us! We’re still seven! I believe that a person’s soul stays here for nine days before going to heaven. I hope so! I hope Ambo is still with us! Ambo don’t leave us! Let us feel you! I feel that he’s still with us. He’s just here. Ambo, you still can’t die! Not yet! Ambo! Let’s give him a tribute. Ambo is a great person. Let’s all stand up. Attention! Salute! Ambo, we know you’re dead but don’t haunt us! I’m alive! Don’t come near! You’re dead! You’re dead! I’m alive! You’re dead! You’re dead! - I’m alive! - What? Sweetheart. He’s alive! He’s alive! Ambo! You’re really alive! You’re alive! Aside from the weapons we have, I invented three special weapons. Weapon one, a camera gun. Camera? Crazy! That’s a gun! May is right. This is a camera gun. After five seconds when the camera timer is done, there's a delayed shot. This is what Ambo’s heroism did. Thank you. This one. I call this 45 reversible. There. Who ever has this, is like commiting suicide. And I offer this to my... Good friend. Bad enemy. I mean lovable. Jealous. - Jealous? - How about me? You? For you. - What’s this? - Gun. So heavy. You’re heavy as well. What’s the third weapon? The third and final weapon. The ultimate weapon! That? - That’s the ultimate weapon? - Yes! - It doesn’t have an engine. - How did that became an ultimate weapon? Just wait and see what it can do. I have news. Good news and bad news. There’s a signal! Hurry! Hurry up! Come on! Come on! Move! Move! Come on! Hello? Africa? Hello Africa? Wait, wait! Why? That’s not what I’ve heard. It's so clear. What? The bad news is from now on, we will not export drugs. Shabu? Stop it! The good news is from now on, we will be the one that will export illegal drugs. Because we have our own factory that can supply not only in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, but whole Asia! Nice! Nice! Okay! Because I believe that a person who's hard-working, will easily reach the pinnacle of success. Right! Let’s all stand up. And join me for a toast. For our new laboratory! To our new laboratory! Wait, it's not us, it's them! For our success! Tomorrow, everyone, and ten of your people will join me to the inauguration of our new laboratory. And tomorrow is the arrival of Mr. Mariano Noriega. The best chemist of illegal drugs in the whole South America. Good morning, Miss! I presume that you’re Ms. Madonna? Yes sir, at your service. My pleasure. Oh! What’s this miss? You know that my house is built on top of a dungeon. Very clever, Miss. We have to because the authorities here in our country are very smart. You see, we have to out smart them. How about these people, miss? They are my people, and they’re willing to die and kill for me! Don’t worry, also for you, they’re willing to kill for you. Very good! I think I found a partner in you, miss. Shall we see the laboratory? Shall we go? I'm very excited! I would like to see the laboratory. Let's proceed. This place fascinates me. And looking at you interests me. Why, sir? You’re so beautiful, so innocent. To be involved in this rotten business. This is it, Sir Noriega. I have followed all your specifications to the letter. Very good! Very good! I supposed that everything I need is here. But of course, everything you need to produce that wonderful grain of ecstasy is here. So when do you wish to start, sir? Miss, I'm an early riser. I always start my day as the sun rises. The sun just rose, and you're already playing cards. No! Don't bother us! We're enjoying here. - What's that? - Poker. I want to join! This guy... Thank you. You're welcome. Breakfast is ready! Good morning! Next time, bring me some tropical fruits, like mango, papaya. Sir, we have it! For awhile! I'll be back! Thank you. Who are you? Where is the laboratory? I don't know! I just arrived! You don't know! The laboratory's downstairs. Down the dungeon. I'll leave this to you. What? Have you forgotten me? No, I thought you're a bad person. I'm ready to help you. Really? What's that noise? - Looks like it's from outside. - Check it! - Hurry! - Are you okay? Backwards. Do you know how to make shabu? We'll see. This is from a solid rock like alum. That is crushed. Taste like volcanic ash. You got it? Got you! Jude, hold it. Go walk! None! Don't move! Don't force me! I told you don't force me. Hey! Wait! I will just drink. You're dead now! - Have mercy on me! - You're dead now! Don't! Don't! Get the message. Easy call. Hurry! Move! Reverse! Get in! Now! What? Also what? You want to die at the same time? One! Two! Two and a half! That's important for me! - I'm going to deep fry that! - Yes. Susan! Susan! Thank you so much and I landed on your arms. You are my hero. Ambo! Don't! Don't! This is Ana. She saved me. She's an ally. Oh, she's an ally. - What the! - Nasties! Nasties! She's mine! Stay there kids! Follow me! Wait! All of you have partners, but I don't. Where is Susan? Hey, I'm here! Maybe we're meant for each other. Why? Pardon me. The law is law. You need to pay and suffer for the young minds of the youth that you destroyed. I'm regretting everything. Don't give me to them. I love you! Believe me. Regret is not enough. The law says, The judge's stick is the one who punishes. That's the law! Law of the Jai alai! Like in mahjong, win! All up! In-between! Chow! Escalera. Before the fifth. Everything! Sir. Let's go. You animal! Liar! That's what you get! Save me! Shameless! No! Run!
