Do you mind if I sit down? Ah, I'm sorry, I can't buy you a drink. Well, do you mind if I buy the drink. Mind? It's the best offer I've had tonight. Be my guest. Gin and tonic. Um... uh, build one on top of this. Wow. That music, that's exactly the way we feel, isn't it? Exactly the way we feel? I... I give up. What game are we playing? No game. I was sitting at the bar all by myself. Would you listen to that and not get lonely? I got tired of being lonely. What kind of city is London if someone like you gets lonely? - Uh! Uh-huh. - Uh. Cheers. You can tell me about it if you like. Now I got it. I got your mink coat had me fooled for a minute. You're from the welfare society. Do you have a cigarette? I think you've worked hard enough for one. Couldn't you be a little more friendly? - You never know, - I might be "missed opportunity" knocking at your door. The last time "missed opportunity" knocked at my door, - I let her in. - Oh. - What happened? - Now I haven't even got a door. Uh, bring us two more of the same. Was she pretty? Hmm? Missed opportunity, was she pretty? Mm-hmm, and expensive. Did you marry her? Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. This pair is on me. And keep the change. Thank you, sir. Was that really your last ten shillings? That, my mysterious young lady, is an understatement, that I am now absolutely, positively, and completely broke. Perhaps I could interest you in a job. What did you have in mind? I've got just the job for you. It pays well. Five hundred pounds. What did you say? Five hundred pounds. Oh, that's beautiful. We have to get started if we're going to get there in time. Will you help me? Mmm, that's pretty. What is it? Fantasia. - You even smell like money. - Hmm. A little bit of help, Miss? No thanks, Ernie, we'll manage. Shall I recall Brogan, Miss? - It's pouring rain outside. I want to get this straight. What kind... what kind of a job is this anyway? You might at least pay a little attention when a girl asks you to marry her. Yeah. So... So it... wasn't a dream. We really are married. Is that a proposal? Oh. - Oh. I, uh... I--I--I must of walked up the wrong flight of stairs. Walked? - Is, uh... this your place? - As long as I pay the rent. This was soiled. I did the best I could. Thanks. - Coffee? - Oh yes, please. Just what am I doing here? I was hoping you could tell me. I'm sorry. Well, don't you know? I had the joy of a persistent man with a doorbell. I don't know what you're selling, chum, but I rarely buy from bell pushers after 2:00 am. - Well, why did you let me in? - It was raining. Oh, do you mind drinking from a cup without a handle? No ma'am. London is the city of the welcoming hand. Like our American guests, they have a good time. You do want it black, don't you? Yes. Look if you're waiting for an explanation... I'm afraid I haven't got any. As far as I'm concerned last night was a complete blackout. Hmm... You've been away from wherever you come from long? - Joe...? Ed...? William...? - Hmm? Yes, I've always been away. Even when I was a kid. And the name is Morrow, - Casey Morrow. - Mm. My name is Margaret Doone. Maggie has more possibilities. Hi, Maggie. How far away is... "away"? - Chicago. - Chicago, um, exciting. Exciting. Well, not the section I come from. It's full of garbage cans and alleys. Deep freeze in the winter. Sweat box in the summer. Hmm... Now what? I don't know. I want to be wherever things are smooth. You know plate glass, chrome, expensive furniture. Hmm... Well, that takes care of the past and the future. What about the present? You know you've been staring at that picture ever since you opened your eyes. Thanks very much, but I'm not that good a painter, yet. You know... I dreamed that, that painting proposed to me last night. Must have been my imagination. The way you were last night, it's a wonder you could even remember your imagination. I--I better be going. I did bring a coat with me, didn't I? Oh yes, I'll get it for you. Excuse me. - I'm sorry. - That's all right. Hey, just exactly where are we? Oh, you're in Chelsea. Number One Lynden Street. Can I steal a couple of your cigarettes? - Yes, help yourself. - Thank you. There's still some coffee. And get rid of this beautiful hangover? No. Well... Goodbye... Casey? Goodbye, Maggie Dune. Thanks for everything. Can I trouble you for a light? Thanks. Would you like me to turn the page, mister? Oh... Never mind. Well, it was pretty dark, Inspector. The same as I told you before, I got an eagle eye for remembering faces. Part of me trade, you know, remembering customers' faces and names. Yes, Ernie, but right now our only interest is in one particular face. You remember all about his face, we'll find out his name. Well, personally, I don't think you'll find he was registered here. He was broke. He counted out every shilling like it was his last. Well, was he dark? Fair? Tall? Short? Fat? Thin? Bald? He was dark, Inspector. Just a moment, I think he was wearing a sort of lightish overcoat. Camel hair it was and he had a brown hat. Ooh, I'd remember him anywhere. - Your bag, sir? - No. No, I'll handle it. Yes, sir. I'm checking out. The name is Morrow, Casey Morrow. Certainly sir. Will you get me Mr. Morrow's bill please? - Mr. Morrow. Yes. - Whitehall 1, 2, 1, 2. Spelt with two R's? - Mr. Morrow? - Huh? - Spelt with two R's? - Uh, just the way I signed it. - Extension 3, 2, 5. - Phillips, Johnson here. I'm back at the Cloud Room. - I've got some more on the mystery man. - Yes, the bartender remembers he was - wearing a camel hair coat and a brown hat. Mr. Morrow, you've paid in advance. - Oh, I have, uh, well-- - He also says he could... ...make a positive identification. Any forwarding address, Mr. Morrow? No. Anybody who wants me knows where they can find me. - All right, got that? - Just a minute, sir. Sir! You were forgetting your bags, sir. Thanks. This has just come through, sir. Oh, there you are. - I want to talk to you. - All right, talk. Not here, in your apartment. Oh no, I've done my good deed. Open the door. Go on, open it! So you read the paper, did you? Yes. Got it. Never mind that. There are two questions I want answered. Just two! One! How did that blood get on my coat? What blood? The blood you washed off this morning. How do I know how it got on your coat? Didn't you think it was peculiar, finding blood on my coat? No, not if you had been in a fight. You didn't find any marks on me? I didn't give you a physical examination. What are you driving at? Question number two! Where is she? I wish I knew. I'd like to finish that painting. Now stop playing the wide-eyed artist. I didn't just happen on your doorstep, I was dumped! Who would do a thing like that? She did! I thought she was something I dreamed up out of a bottle until I hit the streets this morning and found out that her father had been murdered. They seem to think she was, too. That's not what I think! You know what I think? I think she did it and she framed me! Then why come back here? Because I think you're in on it. - You! - That painting is too much of a coincidence. Now I want to know, where is she! Now just a minute! Let me tell you something, I don't have to think! There was blood on your coat. And they're looking for an unidentified man who walked out of the Cloud Room - with Phyllis Brunner. - I explained that to you. I don't know whose the blood was but from what you say, you're the unidentified man. Well, I don't want to get mixed up in any murders and I don't know how you got mixed up with Phyllis Brunner. She paid me £500 to marry her. Did you? I don't know. I don't know! I came to London to get a job. It fell through. I started to hang one on in the Cloud Room. And then this girl hits me with this proposition. From then on my... my memory stops operating. Now it's your turn. Well, I'll tell you all I know about her. That ain't too much. I first met her going into Papadonikos studio next door. He teaches dancing. He's good and he's cheap and Paula didn't seem to have much money. Paula? That's the name she was using then. She had the most haunting eyes I've ever seen. I'll bet she smelled pretty, too. Yeah. Uh, where do you want me to put these? Oh, they go in the kitchen. I asked her to sit for me and she did. She enjoyed posing. I felt sorry for her so I told her she could move in here. She was a good model but she was an awful liar. How do you mean? She told some story about her mother being a prima donna and her father a banished nobleman living in a Parisian hovel. - I believe she had an imagination. - Hm. She walked into our lopsided little world, played around a little while and then walked out again. And no one's heard of her since? One of Papadonikos students claims she saw her getting into a black limousine, protesting, in tears. She vanished, except for this. I came across it in a copy of the Tattler about 3 weeks ago. The name is different but the face is the same. - Mr. and Mrs. Darius Brunner announce the engagement of their daughter, Phyllis, to Lance Gordon, prominent young lawyer. Why be jealous? You don't even know you're married to the girl. Why don't you go to the police? Go to the police with blood on my coat and probably my fingerprints all over the poker. - You out of your mind? - All right. All right. Sit down, I'm on your side. Are you positive Phyllis Brunner asked you to marry her? I didn't dream up this! You know, it's a nice picture of your wife and her fiancé. I'm not interested in her love life. All I want to do is find the... bride. Maybe you should be interested in her love life. The wedding will take place in St George's, Hanover Square, on Christmas Eve. Christmas Eve... That's 3 weeks from now. If Phyllis Brunner rigged up a wedding with someone else, you, then she wouldn't have to go through with this wedding to Lance Gordon. Hey, that makes sense. She was running away when she came to Papadonikos. Only something caught up to her and dragged her back. How do you know she was running away just as hard yesterday? I don't. But I know this, if I don't catch up with her pretty soon, I'll be running, too. With my feet in the air and a noose around my neck. Then why don't you do something about it? - Do what? - Well, go out. Ask some questions. Find out about this... this Lance Gordon. Do some detecting. What do I know about things like that. It's just a matter of common sense. Use your head. - Be a detective? - Hm. I could do that. I've seen enough movies. Oh no, no I can't go out, the police would grab me. Why should they? They don't know anything about you. Oh, yes they do. They know about my coat and my hat. - I heard them. - Well after all, all you just got to buy a new coat and hat and you'll look like anybody else in the street. Hmm, it's worth a try. Maggie, - if you do me a big favor-- - Oh, no. - No. - Now Maggie, please, will you? I take in a drunk so he won't freeze to death and I find myself knee deep in murder. - Oh, no. - Maggie you got to help me out. I've got to find out whether I'm a murderer or--or a bridegroom. What size? - Mr. Gordon isn't in. I don't expect him in. All appointments for today are cancelled. You, uh, sound like a recording. Only you don't look mechanical at all. Then I'll be blunt. Mr. Gordon is out. Out where? I'm his secretary not his nursemaid. He didn't leave a schedule. Well, what do you do when something important comes up? - Such as? - Such as, I'd like to see him. Well, if you're one of those reporter men, you're a bit late. There's no fooling you, is there? So the boys have already been around, huh? Hours ago. This is the, uh... Brunner Bldg., isn't it? - This is a big day for discoveries for you, isn't it? Ah, it's very convenient having your office in the building owned by your prospective father-in-law. I suppose he threw a lot of business his way, didn't he? - I suppose he did. - Including his own? Perhaps. Ah... his will maybe? Inspector Johnson has been here, too. Inspector Johnson. Oh, he's always one step ahead of me. Uh, did you know the Brunner's? Were Mr. and Mrs. Brunner around the office very much? You're a real wide awake reporter, aren't you? Everybody knows the Brunner's have separated. Well, I mean it's not official, but everybody knows. Oh, of course, everybody knows. That's why he had an apartment in town and she lived in the country. What about the daughter? Where did the fabulous heiress live? Oh, you've heard of her. You know, the girl who's going to marry your boss? Or is she? [Man] Or is she what!? For a minute I thought your voice was changing. Who is this man? Oh, he's one of those newspaper men, Mr. Gordon, I've been trying to get rid of him. Have you had your lunch, Miss Nardis? No I haven't, but it doesn't - really matter. - Then I think you had better go, now! Travis, take those things home. Will you put them in my dressing room? And don't forget to post those letters. - You'll find them on my desk. - Sir. Oh, and Travis, I shall be back for dinner tonight, about uh... - 7:30. - Sir. Bye, Miss Nardis. Now, sir, you were saying - when I came in? - That's a cute secretary you got there. - You're intimating that some estrangement existed between Miss Brunner and myself. Well, somewhere along the line I got the idea that uh... couple a months ago, Miss Brunner ran out on you and joined a ballet school. - You've been misinformed. - Oh? Miss Brunner is interested in dancing, along with the other arts, but it has never formed a basis of any misunderstanding between us. And there was no misunder- standing between you when she went off to the Cloud Room yesterday? Yes... Yes, we had our differences. People do, you know. Miss Brunner is young and is highly strung. And is inclined to worry about her father. Why, because uh... her parents weren't getting along? What exactly do you mean by that? - Haven't you heard? - Nonsense. - I know the Brunner family intimately. And you know they were separated. - Separated? - Why, the whole town's talking. - Ridiculous. It's true that Mr. Brunner took a flat in town some months ago but that was on the advice of his doctor. The long drive from his country house took quite a bit out of him. That's what I meant when I said his daughter worried about him. And every time she worried, did she always go off to the nearest bar? I told you, she's highly strung. And lonesome. Now look here, I'm not sure what angle you're working on, but it's certainly not in good taste. Neither is murder. All right, so it may be. This tragedy has upset Mrs. Brunner quite enough without having her daughter's somewhat erratic conduct distorted for the reading pleasure of the moronic element that you so obviously serve. - Look, I hate to upset Mrs. Brunner, but if darling daughter bounced a poker or popped his head, even the morons have got a right to know. Yes, but she adored her father. Yeah, but he's dead and she's missing. You seem to know a good deal about the Brunner family. Which paper did you say you came from? - I didn't, now this girl-- - Well, never mind about that. - Which paper do you represent? Uh... The Globe. - The Globe? - Hm. The London Globe? - Overseas branch. - Oh yeah. I suppose you don't mind if I verify that. Not at all. What is the number? Uh... it just seems to have slipped my mind. Then perhaps the police... can tell us the number. Well, call them up, I've got nothing to worry about. If you think-- Ah! Maggie? - I wanted to find you again. - I'll bet you did. I did. I did, really. I wanted to tell you why I brought you here. Well... well why else do you think I came back? - I don't know. Maybe you wanted some more of that perfume to go to my head. Maybe you wanted to offer me another job. What are you insinuating? Look... frankly my memory isn't any too good about last night. All I know for certain is that you offered me some kind of a job, and I wake up this morning and your father's dead. And there's blood on my coat and I've got 500 pounds on me. - No... - And you say I'm insinuating. No. No, it's not what you think. I didn't hire you to kill my father. I don't know why you hired me, but whatever you did you sure supplied me with a beautiful motive. You've got it all figured out. I may have missed a few details. Yes... you've got it all figured out. Well, if you've... You've got another version? Thank you. Thank you very much. Well, what do you expect me to think? I don't know. I'm sorry, I've... I've been frantic all day. I... I just didn't stop to consider what you must have been thinking. If you'll only listen. - I... ohh... - Hey, hey, hey. - Uh, I didn't hit her, she fainted. Stop acting like a helpless male and... go away somewhere while I get her out of these wet things. Go make some tea, if you know how. She's just a kid. Everybody's little mother: "Maggie Doone holds open house" Lucky mink doesn't shrink. Make the tea! How do you light the stove? - Oh, don't bother with that, just plug in the kettle. - Fill it first. Where are the tea bags? Oh no, no... I'll make it myself. You just boil the kettle and warm the pot. Warm it? - Anything else I can do? - Just a minute. - How is she? - She's alive. - Casey... Do you know my name? You must know a lot more. It wasn't the way you said. All right, how was it? It was terrible. It was late when we reached my father's apartment and-- you were awfully drunk. But I managed to get you up the stairs and into the apartment. Go on. We were clear into the room... before I saw what had happened. I couldn't cry out or even move for a moment. But you stumbled over the poker on the floor and picked it up. That's how you got the blood on your coat. - I picked it up. - Yes. That's fine. I knew I wouldn't be happy unless I had the fingerprints all over the poker. Then I heard the elevator coming back up... and I got panic stricken. I should have called the police, I suppose, but I was afraid for you, Casey. I didn't want to get you into trouble. Ha... That's what I call being thoughtful. - I mean it. I finally got you downstairs and into the car. We must have driven around in the rain for hours before I thought of bringing you here. It was the only place I could think of. I rang the bell and ran. Where'd you go? Oh, I... I started to go home, to Mother's but, I... - I couldn't. - Why not? I... I don't know. I just couldn't. If she beats you she has my deepest admiration. Oh, Casey, you've got to believe me. I didn't kill my father. Why should I? He's the only person I ever really loved. Oh, you've got to help me find out who killed him. No, you've got this all wrong. You've got to go to the police and help me clear me. Not before we do what I said. The hard part is going to be proving it. He's very, very, clever. - You think you know who it was? - I know. My father was the only person he was afraid of. He said I didn't have to marry him if I didn't want to. Maggie thinks it was, uh... Lance Gordon you were running away from the last time you were here. Maggie's right. I was running away from him. He was always after me to marry him. I'll make the tea. All right, you're beautiful, but Gordon is surrounded by beautiful women. Why would he be so set on marrying you? Money! He's got a rug in his office like an uncut lawn. Fabulous furniture and a very expensive looking secretary. And where do you think they would be without - my father's bank account? - Well, what are you trying to say? That he would kill the man who made all this possible? - His meal ticket? Is that your theory? I'm not giving you a theory. I'm giving you the truth. - And if you don't believe it, it doesn't matter. Because you're going to do just exactly what I tell you. Now, just a minute! - Might, at least, say please. - You had better, Casey, because if you don't, I shall just have to go to the police and tell them how you abducted me after killing my father. You'll do what! I will. I'll do it! Let's get back to the truth. There was no motive for me unless you paid me. In which case you won't be telling the police anything, after all your father was nothing to me. Oh, but he was. I miss something? You missed everything. I had to prop you up during the entire ceremony. Ceremony? Darius Brunner became your father-in-law by special license. It's all properly witnessed and everything. But Phyllis, that's impossible - you couldn't have. - Maggie, please. And now Lance can't marry me and can't get control of the money. What money? My money of course, and lots of it. Except I'm not legally of age, I have to have a guardian or a husband. - As my husband, you have a very good motive. Well? You know, I think you two children will be very happy. Imagine you coming all the way from Edinburgh for your honeymoon. Well, you're very lucky, very lucky indeed. To find a flat in London at this time of the year? Over found and out, we are. But of course, you being on your honeymoon. Why, it's quite lovely. Isn't it lovely? Yes, dear. Well, don't just stand there, put the bags down. Yes, dear. You like it then? Oh, I knew you would. Well now, rent is by the week. - And it's customary to, uh-- - Here you are. Oooh... Thank you very much. - I hope you'll be very happy. - Yes, I'm sure we'll be very happy. - I think you'll find it's a very nice flat. - Oh, it's a nice flat. The people that were here before, they didn't want to leave. - They didn't? They thought it was such a beautiful place - Oh, it's the most beautiful... - Thank you. ...flat I've seen in years. It's a regular Garden of Eden. Well... - You keeping a diary? - Mm-hmm. Expenses, for the rent. Those clothes you bought and the taxi over here. I see and when all this is over, I'm going to get the bill. Exactly, and now Miss Mastermind, I-- Mrs. And now Mrs. Mastermind, since we've kept out of jail this far, what do we do now? I told you. Find out why Lance killed my father. - He has a perfect alibi. - Every newspaper report says the same thing. - He drove out to the country. - He had dinner. He stayed the night. - Even your mother backs him up. I thought I told you, he's got Mother hypnotized. She'd say anything to help him. Now, this is what you've got to do. - What I've got to do! - Yes! First of all, you're going to check up on Lance Gordon's alibis. Then you're going to see Lita Huntley. - Who's Lita Huntley? - She's Father's secretary. She knows all his private business. Then you're going to see Mother. She may know something which she doesn't realize is important. We'll go now and have dinner and then I think you should take a sober look at Father's apartment. Come on, Casey. - Casey. Yes, dear. Is this where it happened? Then you remember? I don't know. I get a strange feeling. Like, uh... kind of a nightmare. Well, if we're going to do something, let's do it. Hey... what are we looking for? Oh, I don't know. There must be something here. Well, you look in those drawers. Hey... checkbook. Maybe the check stubs will tell us something. Who's Arvid Peterson? He's a caretaker to the estate. Insurance, insurance, insurance... Alicia Brunner... personal charity. More Alicia Brunner. More charity, more charity. Phyllis Brunner, personal, 500 pounds. The day he was killed. I could hardly tell him what I wanted it for, could I? Who's Carter B. Groot? Groot, Carter B. Groot. Personal, 685 pounds, 15 shillings. On the same day. Got to be Groot. I've never heard of him. [muffled talking in background] Put it back. The light. Is that your mother? It's terribly gloomy in here. Are you sure you want to stay? Well there's no reason why I shouldn't stay. I'm not a child, Lance. But you've been through so much. You know, I'm quite all right. And after all, things have to be said, however unpleasant. I may as well start facing them right now. Well... as you wish. Well, telephone me if there's anything you want. I will. I'd better be getting on my way now, and... I have to see Inspector Johnson again. - Good night, Lance. - Good night. Try to get some rest. She's in the bedroom. Let's go. - Hey, don't you think you ought to tell her you're alive? - No! - Yes? - Uh, is Mrs. Brunner in? No, I'm afraid not. She left the country immediately after the funeral. I'm Mr. Brunner's secretary, can I help you? - Oh, Miss Huntley? Lita Huntley? - Yes, that's right. I was going to look you up anyway. I'm from the, um... Colonial Mutual Insurance Company. Insurance? Oh, I'm really not interested. Oh, no, no, no. I'm not going to sell insurance. - I'm investigating. - Oh. Perhaps you had better come in. Will you come this way? I'm sorry to barge in on you like this. I know this has been a difficult time for you, but I'm... sure you want to help us clear up this... terrible affair. Well, yes I do, Mr. Brunner was such a fine man, I... I... I still can't believe it. - I'm sorry, Mr...? - Ah, Kelly. I'm so sorry, Mr. Kelly, but things have been... very difficult. - Won't you sit down? - Thank you. Now... what can I do to help you? My company is anxious to settle all claims. But, one of the principle beneficiaries is... involved. You must mean Phyllis. - She's still missing. - Yes, I know. I understand that Mr. Brunner contributed a great deal to charities. Oh, they were Mrs. Brunner's charities. At the moment, it's Green Pastures Foundation. - A really wonderful idea. A country home for children out of the slums. Of course, all I know about it is what I heard Mr. Gordon tell Mr. Brunner. - Gordon? - Yes. He's mixed up in this Green Pastures thing, too? Of course, Mr. Gordon handles all Mrs. Brunner’s affairs. And Brunner didn't object to Gordon handling all of Mrs. Brunner's affairs? Why should he? Mr. Gordon is almost one of the family. Well, didn't he object to the impending marriage? Why on earth should he? Mr. Gordon is... is so well liked and dependable. We were all hoping he'd have a steadying influence on Phyllis. Well, I guess that about covers everything. Thank you very much. Um... can you tell me where I can find Carter Groot? - I beg your pardon? - Groot. Carter B. Groot. I understand he's a friend of Mr. Brunner's. Carter B. Groot? Oh yes, of course, I remember now, I rang him once for Mr. Brunner. He's a private detective. Detective? Well, do you know where I can find him? - Ever try the telephone book? - Huh. I, uh... I wonder what Mr. Brunner wanted with a private eye? You say you're an investigator, well... find out. Phyllis! Phyllis! I've been in and out of more apartments and homes lately than a real-estate agent. - Casey, look. Someone's broken into it! Oh, it's his case file. Well, see if there's anything about your father in there. Bet you dollars to donuts there isn't. Benson... Brown... - Brimer... - What a waste. You're right. There's nothing about Brunner. Lance must have beaten us to it. Well... Well, look around the apartment. Maybe you overlooked something. Come on! Come on! What a peculiar looking radio. Here's something. Seems to be a list of his clients. There's your father in here. Does it say what he was investigating? No. Well, we'll stick this in an envelope, send it to the police and maybe they can make something out of it. [Police Radio] [Car 23 to EW, message received. Out.] [Car 23, proceed to Number 4 Thomas Muse.] [A burglary reported.] - He was the one at the-- - Shhhhh. [Car 23 to EW, message received. Out.] [Car 12 proceed to Grosvenor Square.] - [A suspicious person...] - That's it. - [has been reported.] - That's what? That's it! The whisky, the cigarette butts, the police call. And that paper, I bet you it's dated Monday. Yes, you're-you're right. Groot was sitting here. Having a nightcap. Reading his paper. Listening to the police calls. He probably listened every night being a detective. He'd pick up some business that way. And it was on a Monday night that Darius Brunner was murdered. It was on a Monday night that Groot sat in this chair just having receive the big fat fee from your father for digging up dirt about somebody your father was after. And he heard the police call that told him it was a homicide at your father's address. I knew... He knew that... the killer must have been the man he was investigating. And he had a complete report on him in his files. Now, there's two things he could have done. He could have gone to the police, which he obviously didn't. He wouldn't be chasing us. Then we would have heard something about it in the papers, or... he contacted the killer... told him he had a full biographical report on him... and offered to swap him it for a good blackmail fee. Only there's one little item that Carter B. forgot. - Well, what? - Life insurance. Because when he turns up, if he ever turns up, he's going to be the deadest man ever killed. Because the killer made a deal with him and paid him off. - Permanently! - And took the file? But indubitably. And I said that pretty good for an American. The tank is full and it's hired for a week. Not a bad-looking job. Casey, what are you getting out of this? Well, after this is over, a nice quite annulment in exchange for a nice, fat settlement. Oh, you're doing this for money, not for love. - What? - Uh, for adventure, I mean. Uhhh, let's see now, you didn't tell me what this was? - That's the hand brake. - Oh. By the way, did you ever hear of the Green Pastures Foundation? Green Pastures? Green Pastures? - It's Mrs. Brunner's pet charity. - Ohh? Yeah. It's supposed to be a country home for slum children. - Supposed to be? - Well, Gordon's mixed up in it. And anything he's in on can't possibly be on the level. But what about Mrs. Brunner? Well, according to Phyllis, all she does is endorse the checks that Brunner gave her and pose for the press. But Gordon's the one that runs it. Did it ever occur to you that it might be unhealthy to run around snapping your fingers in Gordon's face? If you're on the right track, that is. Honey, it's going to be unhealthy for me until the killer gives his memoirs to a court stenographer. Casey, please be careful. [in Irish accent] Sure now, and you wouldn't be worrying about the likes of me, would you, Maggie Doone? Shut up. My father was a Scot and my mother came from Wales. Ah, it's nice to have you worrying about me. I'm not worrying about you, it's the car. It's hired in my name. So long, Maggie. Casey, look out! Oh... Casey! Casey... Casey... Are you all right? I'm all right. Ah... I'm so glad. It's hit me in the head. Old "Iron-Head" Morrow. What were you doing on the street? I-- I was waiting in the hall for you. Lucky for me. I always wait for you when you're out. You do? I'll... I'll help you get up. Did you see who it was? Yeah, it was... your friend Gordon's servant. Playful little, oh... Oh. Oh, you are hurt. I'll take you indoors, all right. No, no, no, wait a minute. Wait. Was anybody... around here today asking any questions? Well, no. Nobody knows we're here. Oh, they do now. We got to get out of here. I don't want them to find you. Your friend Gordon plays too rough. Well... shall we go back to Maggie's? No, let's leave her out of this, we've done enough to her. Well, where shall we go? We must go somewhere safe. Well, I've been postponing this for a long time. We'll go home. No. I'm not going home to Mother's. - I... I told you before-- - Now, take it easy. Now easy. Not your home. My home. - Figures. - Figures don't mean anything. They ain't figures. I'm giving you statistics. - Government statistics. - Who needs statistics? My business gets bad I know it. You lose your job, by gosh, you know it. People can't eat statistics. So it's you. So you finally came to see us. How's Ma? How's Ma? What do you mean, how's Ma? Nine, ten years you haven't been to see her. Eight years. All right, excuse me, eight years. Not a letter. Not a card. Not a word since I brought your Ma to England. Is she all right? You see John, I-- All right, now you're here, you might as well see her. She's upstairs. Always you bringing statistics. - But you can't get away from them. Figures, figures, figures! Can't you think of anything else but figures? - Figures don't lie. Ah, maybe nothing is yet, everything. Hello, Ma. John said you were here, so I... came upstairs. It isn't true. I'm real enough. It isn't right. I thought you were dead. I burned candles. - John said do not expect Casimir to come back. - I looked for you to come back. But you didn't come. Why didn't you come back? I don't know. You wait... and try to become somebody and... - the years pass,... then you're ashamed to come back. You look fine, Casimir. You didn't get hurt in the war? I was lucky. You in trouble? No trouble, Ma. - I've seen you in trouble before. - You look the same way. No trouble, I... I just came to England and... I thought it was about time to-- This is Phyllis. She's my wife. PHYLISS: I'm so happy to meet you. CASEY: We only got married a couple of days ago. So... You're looking fine, Mom. And Big John looks fine. I-- I-- I-- bet this place keeps you very busy, huh? You need money? No, I don't need money. I told you, I just got to England. We were just passing through. If you want us... to go, we'll go. - Is that what you want us to do? - We were just passing. He's tired. We've been driving all day. But if it's going to make any trouble for you, us staying here, we'll go. We don't have anything fancy. But you can have this room, if you like. - Oh, Casimir. - Mom. My boy. At last. - Be sure to beat the eggs well. - That is the secret, and don't forget the paprika. - Oh, it sounds delicious. - It is and you will find it - a great favorite with Casimir. - Hi! Hello, Ma. Guess what? Your Mother's been teaching me some of her recipes. Well, if I had known I would have stopped off with some bicarbonate of soda. - Ha-ha. - Where have you been? Well, I told you I'd get it cut down and I finally did. You know, it's a funny thing, Mom, we got married in such a hurry I bought a ring a couple sizes too large. - Well, there you are. - You put it on. All right. Casimir Morrokowsky, this calls for a celebration. It's wonderful! We must have a party! MA: John! John! That's me... Casimir Morrokowsky. Now you know why I changed my name to Casey Morrow. Thanks for the ring, ...Casimir. Quiet. Quiet everybody! We're going to have a party and there's drinks on the house! [Cheering] Let's go boys, let's have some music. No, no, no! No. Play the floor. This dance is in honor of our new bride and groom. Let them dance alone. Come on, the bride and groom! [Clapping and crowd yelling, "Yay"] I'm a terrible dancer. Maybe you've never danced with the right person. Come on, everybody! Dance! Oh, excuse me, I'm sorry. A drink for you, son. I guess I lost her to that Romeo. Is this the happy bridegroom? Why have beer on a night like this, have some whisky. - Why the celebration? - Oh, this is Inspector Johnson. Inspector, this is Casimir, my son. We thought he was dead. - Glad to know you. - Uh, how do you do? There are those who might say he's the same as dead. But being a happily married man myself, congratulations, Casimir. - Thank you. - Get drunk Casimir, that's what wedding parties are for. So that a man can get one good drunk before his wife spoils the fun, eh? Casimir... you had better get your wife before she forgets who is the bridegroom. So, you are in trouble. Why do you say that? The way you looked at the Inspector. He's a very nice man. But always when he comes around there is trouble for someone. Do you think it's trouble I've brought in here now? Casey... you can't run away from yourself, you know? Well, no one can say I didn't try. After the war, I... stayed in Europe for years... searching for... I don't know what. Then I went back to the states... thinking things would be different but it was the same. Except that my mother had married Big John and gone to England to live. So, I... came back to Europe and I've been floating around ever since. Well, you floated into my life. Um... Let's get back to the party, huh? - Phyllis, I want-- Oh! - Ah! [Both Laughing] I'm sorry, I didn't mean to-- - Oh, Case. - Darling. Ohh, I've wanted you to kiss me for so long. Honey, tell me honestly, do you really like my mother and Big John? - Oh, they're wonderful people. - No, no, no, wait a minute. I come from this kind of a world. It's a big jump from... garbage cans to mink. Oh Casey, you're a snob. A hopeless snob. I... I guess I am. I-- What's the matter? Casey, let's go away from here. Away, where? I don't know... Anywhere. - I'm afraid. - Oh, no darling. Now, we stay. No more running. We stay and we clear up this mess, once and for all. - How? - I don't know how but we will. I promise you we will. Believe me. I believe you. And when we do, you and me... - Yes. - We... Who are you, Mr. Morrow? Practically nobody. And yet you know the whereabouts of my daughter. - That's right. - I see. How much are you asking to divulge this information? Now just a minute! I'm not holding your daughter for ransom, if that's what you mean. She can come home anytime she wants to. Only she doesn't want to come home. She's afraid. - Of the police? - No. I don't understand. Mrs. Brunner... Did you ever hear your husband speak about a man named Carter Groot? No, I'm sure he didn't. Who is he? Well... he's a private detective. He was doing a job for your husband. He finished that job on Monday night. The Monday your husband was killed. What was he investigating? I can't find out. He's been missing since Monday, too. But that's dreadful. Tell me, how long have you known Lance Gordon? So, it's Lance again. This was Phyllis' idea, of course. Well it was to begin with. Whenever she and Lance have a tiff, he becomes a mortal enemy with designs on her fortune. Mrs. Brunner... another question. What's with this Green Pastures Foundation? Well... Gordon controls all the funds. He drew up the plans and he did the purchasing. Purchasing? Oh, Lance found an ideal place for the project last spring. As soon as he told me about it, I made out a check. To Gordon? No, to the fellow of the property. Fifty thousand pounds. You were going to ask, of course. Of course. Uh, what's this place like? Well, I don't know, but Lance tells me it's quite lovely. You paid fifty thousand pounds for a place and you've never even seen it? Well it's 50 miles away also, and very inconvenient to reach. Uh, naturally. Who was the check made out to? Well, you're a very determined young man, aren't you? Now look, I have a very peculiar habit, breathing. Now, about this check? Well, you're right about one thing. Fifty thousand was too much to pay for the property. Thirty five thousand too much. - Why too much? - Oh, I made some inquires. Do you know that place went for 15 thousand, 6 months before Lance made the deal. And uh... you still think that Gordon would make an ideal son-in-law? Oh, he offered to return the money but I told him he could keep it as a loan... and a lesson. And that's why I don't intend for this go any further. Mrs. Brunner... about the check... who was it made out to? Why are you so insistent about it? Look, you and Lancey boy can play school all you want to with 35 thousand pound checks for lessons. But as far as I'm concerned, a man has been murdered and I'm in the middle. Now, I think that check will lead me to Groot and Groot can lead me to the killer. And that would put me in the clear. And if I give you this? Well, it could lead to a happy family reunion. Victor Vanno? His address is on the back. Now, if you'll excuse me... I'm going to see a man about your 50 thousand pounds. Look, I don't want to be a pest, but if you'll-- - Look, how many times do I have to tell you that Mr. Vanno is out. - O-U-T. Out! How many times do I have to ask you when Mr. Vanno is going to be in? I-N. In! - He never says. - If you'll only give me a sec-- - Look here, - This is my private office. - No trespassing. - Excuse me, I lost my head. - I'll wait. [Woman] Yeah, well I work, [Woman] that's all I do. Oh! - I'm sorry. [Woman] It's all right dearie. Vanno? Vanno? Where's Vanno? Why don't you leave him alone? I will not. "On your way", he says. "Don't bother me." Anybody would think he's a duke or an earl or something. Well, nobody's going to push me around. He always does, so go, like always. I will not. Vanno's going to eat those words and I hope he chokes himself and he drops dead. The rat. Vanno? Vanno, honey. Vanno, open up. I want to be near you. - I want to see you. [Vanno] Oh! I'm playing, get out of here. Oh darling, just once. Let me just see you for just a minute. - Please. - I told you to go away. - Beat it! - Ohhh. After all I've done for him, he treats me like that. I wouldn't let him get away with that, tell him off. - Huh? - Sure. (Shouting) Open up, you fat pig! Open up or I'll tear the house down! I'll tear it down! I'll run it down! You! - Well, what do you know? Played anymore games with automobiles lately? I don't know what you're talking about. And you're Vanno, too? Well, well... - Honey, who is this jerk? - Mr. Opportunity. I picked Vanno's name in a quiz contest. If he picks out the right answers he's going to get a nice, big, fat prize. - Like... what answers? [Casey] Like, what happened to Carter Groot? - Oh, my hand! - My hand! - He hurt his hand. And that's too bad. Maybe, you better lie down. Still playing games, huh? All right, let's play some games. We're going to play question and answer. What happened to Groot? Come on, speak up boy, speak up. - Gordon knows. - Gordon knows. Now what else, Vanno? When did old man Brunner find out about this? - Oh... - Talk to me. Talk to me. You can't pin that on me. Oh, leave him alone, you brute! Whose side are you on anyway? Well... let's go for a little walk, upsy daisy. There we are, nice and easy. - Ooh! - There!... that will teach you not to be a naughty boy. - And as for you, sweetheart, - Mm? I think you two should kiss... and make up. Oh! No... No... - No... no... no... - No, no, let me out! - I don't want to stay in here! - Oh... - Good evening, sir. - Ah, Mrs. Brunner in? What name shall I say, sir? - Oh, she'll see me, it's alright. - Excuse me sir, - I must announce you because-- - It's alright, now relax. - she has someone with her. - Relax. - Come in, Mr. Morrow. You've met Mr. Gordon, my daughters fiancé. So, it's you. We're back in the mink and perfume department. - I should have known. Lance, what are you doing? I'm going to telephone the police. - Wait... I think we should hear what Mr. Morrow has to say first. [Mrs. Brunner] Phyllis tells me you've been holding her prisoner since the night of my husband's death. [Casey] What happened to the other deal? The one where we were going to pin the murder on dear old Gordon. You're lying! [Casey] Me? Lie? Why there was a murder, wasn't there? What about it honey, did you tell them about the real big news? [Mrs. Brunner] News? What news? Then you didn't tell her. Now really sweetheart, Mother should know about us. Maybe she wouldn't approve of such a quick marriage. And the 500 pounds that went with it. Marriage? Just one moment, you inferred you married my daughter? Correction. All I know about it is what she told me. Being a little drunk at the time. [Lance] At what time? Just where and when is this alleged marriage supposed to have taken place? That should be easy enough to verify. It should be. Ask her. It's a lie. There was no marriage. I think this is a matter for the police. I agree. Let's make it a big party. Invite Vanno. And if you can find him, Carter B. Groot. You've been talking to this man. What's he been telling you? Oh Lance, please don't shout at me. But he's lying! Phyllis says he's nothing but a kidnapper. We can invite a few more guests who were at another party Phyllis and I gave the other night. I doubt that you can convince them that she was being held prisoner. Oh, incidentally... One of the guests, uh, uninvited... was a police Inspector. Name of Johnson. I understand he has a reputation of being skeptical about a lot of things. Just what are you after? The same thing you're after. - All I can get. I've been trying to understand your peculiar statements. It seems to be blackmail. Now that's a nasty word, let's call it expenses. Or rather damages for breach of promise. And if we refuse to pay? You'll pay. Gordon's got a lot more to hide than I have. Haven't you Lancey boy? [Phyllis] How much do you want? Make me an offer. Five thousand pounds. Last week that would have been fine. Last week, I was young and innocent. This week the price has doubled. It's a deal. [Lance] But this is ridiculous. - This man has no-- - I said it's a deal. - Pay him off. - But Phyllis! You are my lawyer, pay him off. I never want to see or hear of Mr. Casey Morrow again. You heard what the lady said. You think I can pick 10 thousand pounds out of thin air? It ought to be easy enough for you. Perhaps Mr. Morrow will take a check. Mr. Morrow will not take a check. Mr. Morrow will take cash. And when he gets it, Mr. Morrow will be off to parts unknown. Well... it will take time. Banks open at 10:00 o'clock in the morning. And what time I'm on that plane... depends on when you deliver my going away present. That means you personally. I don't like your friends. - Is that all? - That's all. I'll pick up my own fruit and magazines at the airport. You know my address. I'll go and look after Phyllis. You know... it's very funny but nobody around here seems to be... concerned anymore about who killed, uh... What was his name? Oh yeah, Darius Brunner. I am. You're in love with Phyllis. That story about the marriage can't be true. She's an impulsive child. But the fact remains that you're in love. And a man blinded by emotion seldom acts with caution. In love or not, or married or not, I made a deal with Gordon. And if he doesn't come through, I've got a loud voice. I'm tired of hunting and being hunted! You're hurt because a beautiful girl has used you for her own conveniences. - But you don't understand why. - That's not true. I think it's quite possible she may have loved you. And may have loved Lance, too. I think it's possible she may have used you both. - And may use Lance again. - What are you trying to say? Oh, don't be too hurt and don't be too angry with her. You're young, you'll get over it. Have you a gun, Mr. Morrow? No. My husband's. Do you know how to use it? A man could get hurt with one of those. I learned a great deal tonight. You were too busy watching Phyllis, I was watching Lance. He's a frightened man and frightened men can be dangerous. I don't really want you to have this. My advice to you would be to forget the profit and take the first plane out of town. Thanks for the gun. Phyllis. Where are you? I can smell that perfume of yours. Where are you hiding? Phyllis, where are you? (Gunshot) [Woman] What's going on out there? What's all that noise? Don't you realize it's the middle of the ni--? I thought I heard a shot. What have you done? You've killed him! Police! Now you've killed a man with your gun! Police! Police! You should have seen Gordon's face when his gun wouldn't fire. It could have jammed. No, no, someone emptied it. Don't you see, she didn't need Gordon anymore. He had done all his dirty work for her so she got rid of him. She rigged the whole thing just the way she rigged my marriage. So you finally found out about that. Now it all comes out nice and even. The old mans dead, Gordon's gone... I've got a one way ticket to the gallows. - And dear Phyllis gets all the money. Ohh, how big a chump can you be Mr. Morrow? How stupid can you get? Where are you going? I'm going to have a chat with my ex-bride. Casey, don't go back there! Don't be a fool. But I am a fool, that's what I've been telling you. Maggie, there's one thing I don't understand, I can't figure you. Why did you believe me? Why do you stick by me? I lead a dull life. I want something exciting to put in my diary. Casey! Casey, what are you doing here? Where's Lance? So far as I know, he's right where you left him. - With a bullet in his head. - No! No! You don't have to worry. Nobody will ever know you did it. My fingerprints are on the gun. I didn't pull the trigger the way I was supposed to, but I held the gun. And I was luckier than Gordon, mine was loaded. I don't know what you're talking about. I... I've been here all day. What do they call this stuff, Kiss of Death? Casey, I'm telling you the truth. The truth! What do you know about the truth? You think I've lied to you all along because of last night. Can't you see, Casey? Can't you understand? I had to lie to you last night because you went and blurted out about the marriage. If Lance had even suspected there was any truth in it then you would have been just another person he had to remove. I suppose that's why you ran out on me and went straight back to him. Oh, Casey, you've got things all wrong. I left your Mother's last night because I saw Inspector Johnson coming back. I didn't want to get you into anymore trouble. - You're lying! - I'm not! I love you. Stop lying! What did you do with the gun? Where is the gun? And if you lie to me this time, I'll kill you! Casey, no! You will not move, Mr. Morrow. Is she dead? I think so. Pick up that perfume stopper and make sure. Her own mother! You shouldn't be shocked. After all you're in love with her. - And you killed her! Now it's my turn. One way or the other. The police will be arriving at any moment. I sent for them. You took a lot for granted. - You're so very predictable, Mr. Morrow. I've been waiting for you ever since I returned from that wretched apartment. You're so like Lance. So easily frightened. - You know, I knew exactly what he'd do when he saw that detective's report on my husbands desk. And I knew what he'd do today. Now, pick up that stopper. - And do what I told you. And after that, what am I suppose to do? Confess to three murders? One should be sufficient. How are you going to explain having the gun you killed Gordon with? How are you going to explain your fingerprints on it to the police? My fingerprints are on it. Yours, too. What a pity you're such an emotional man. - You just... dropped the gun, went after Phyllis in a savage manner. I just picked it up. I'm holding you for the authorities. That is, unless you'd rather make a run for it. Now, pick up that stopper! [Phyllis] Oooh... Oooh... (Gunshot) You don't miss a trick, do you? Same perfume. Everything. Hi ya, Casimir, I see you stopped one. And take her with you. Phyllis? You all right, honey? - Ahh... - What's wrong with her? Oh, I had to hit her a little too hard. Would you help me put her on the bed? Sorry, but, uhh. Watch it. Her head. You certainly leave a wide and gory trail behind you. - Why, did you find Gordon? - Yes. I also found the report Groot made on Gordon and Mrs. Brunner. It was hidden in Gordon's office. Oh, then you know I had nothing to do with all this slaughter. Yes, we know that. You know, you shouldn't have run out on me last night, I could have saved you a lot of trouble. - I'll bet. - All I wanted to do is to ask you a few questions about this... This account book, which you obviously mailed to me. Look, last night I wasn't in the mood for answering questions. And by the way, we fished Groots out of the Thames. Yesterday. Very heavy too, with .38 caliber bullets. Look, you find Vanno or Travis or whatever his name is and you'll find the gun to match those slugs. We found him. And he talked as if he had a gramophone needle jabbed in him. Honey, you all right? You all right, baby? Aren't you interested in the motives behind all this? - No! - Oh... all right. Then I won't tell you that Mrs. Brunner had set up a lot of fake charities. And was milking her husband dry with Gordon's help. When Darius Brunner realized what was going on, they got rid of him. And when Groot interfered, they got rid of him, too. However, I won't tell you all that. - Look, are we in the clear? - Yes. Then will you please go away and leave us alone. Please. All right. But, uh, take things easy until the ambulance comes, will you? And Casmir, please... No more corpses. - Casey? - Yes? Darling, look I'm sorry I had to hit you so hard, but I had to. - I just had to. - Why? Well, I'll tell you later. - Casey. - Yes. I've still got that special marriage license. Oh... Oh baby... What's the matter? Ah, what a time for a guy to be caught with only one good arm. Oh...
