woman do you believe in the legend of Naga? Our story begins with the 1,000-year war between the Garudas and Nagas. It was a war to end all wars. AS Nakee, a female Naga, was about to be killed, a brave man called Chaiyasingk saved her life. He fought and chased oﬂthe Garudas. This was the start 0fthe love between a human and a Naga. Nakee became pregnant with his Child. She had to hide it, so as not to be punished, so she prayed for her child to be born as a white eel. At that time, there was a severe drought. The royal soothsayer said that the white eel was a curse. soft chanting Grandma, tell me the story of Nakee again, please. Aren't you bored of hearing it? Of course not. Please tell it again. Love is a powerful force. It can happen at any time. The legend of the love between a human and a Naga was a miracle in itself. They swore to love each other in every life thereafter. One thousand years later, Chaiyasingh was reborn as an archeology student named Tosapol. Nakee also found a way to be reborn in the body of Kamkaew. She was born on the day of a solar eclipse. But their love was doomed from the start. The bad karma from her past life came back to haunt her. Her mother was killed before her eyes. So Nakee struck back in anger. She destroyed the Village and killed everyone. She was punished for her actions. And ordered to keep vows and meditate for 1,000 years. If she broke her vows and did harm again, her punishment would be 1,000 times more severe. I pray for Nakee, to find her true love. both Please bless our fields. Please bless our crop this year. Protect it from ﬂoods and pests. May our ﬁelds be bountiful. After harvest, keep us all healthy and strong. lively music playing I don't know What it was.
