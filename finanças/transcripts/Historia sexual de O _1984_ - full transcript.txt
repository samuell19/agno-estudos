"We try to find among those gray and undefined outlines, "a sharper figure, a hint in the horizon, "as undefined as it might be. "And as we approach, tripping over the low branches or the weeds, "we only discover faces, that are not even unknown, anonymous." I'm Macario, Plastil's fat cat. I'm visiting Mrs. Jimenez at her house. Mrs. Jimenez, why do you use the plastic detergent Plastil? Because Plastil laminates in white and it leaves everything looking brand new. Look at the tablecloths or the skirting boards in the corridor. You should all do as Mrs. Jimenez. There is always something to laminate in your house. But do it with Plastil. No! No! No! Don't take the Plastil pot. How could I live without Plastil at home? She's the perfect prey, don't you think? "You, rubbish crooks, useless princes, "mud hole apostles, "save your pestilence for those dirty hands that are eager to relish every rotten soul, "for those clumsy claws "and black wings of ill omen, "that await in silence at the top of peaks, ignorant of their choice of actions". Come here. I want to kiss you. She'll see us sooner or later. Mmm! Ah! Yes! Uh! I think she has already seen us. Ah! Ha, ha, ha! Oh! "And you, insulting butterflies, multicolored murals, "trailers of forgotten springs, "pay attention to the insult you profess through your bright colors. "You should wear mourning clothes, the wing at half mast, "so as not to provoke the rage of the iconoclasts. "For your insulting perfume "destroys the useless respect of red-brick mausoleums "and the hand of punishment might fall upon you, "and be justified by a hundred official bulletins, "with words that are more empty than your slightest habits." "After all, they're announcing the prices "of silk ties, "patent leather shoes "and overwhelming boots. "And one of these days, once winter is gone, "you'll find a clear passage to the true and candid spring. Amen." Mario, come here. I want her to see us making love. She's watching. We need to drive her crazy. Let me go on top. Ah! Mmh! That's it! That's it, honey! Scream louder. Let her hear you! Ah! Oh! Ahh! Come here. Get down on your knees. Ah! Ahh! Louder, scream louder! Ah! Mhm! She's ready. Go get her. Hurry up. Don't take long. Who's there? Your neighbor. Mara. Hi. How are you? I don't understand. What do you want? Come with me. Come in. It's very nice in here. Very nice. What do you want? Come on. Don't be a fool. Come on. Come on. I don't understand. I'm sure you'll understand this. Do you like it? Come on. Come here. Ah! Mhm! Oh! Hi, how are you? I'm Mario. What's your name? My name, oh, God! Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, too. Ah! Aah! Mhm! Get off her. Mario, what's wrong with you? Nothing, I suppose. She's just a child. But she's the best one. Poor girl. What do you care? They'll pay us more than ever. That's the only thing that matters. It's true. I know. Where are you going? I'm going for a walk. Come with me. Come on. Let's go take a bath. It's funny. I don't understand you at all. Bye, Mario. Where are we going? To the swimming pool. Wait! But I like you. I love him too. Come on. Stop talking and come with me. But, what the hell are you doing? Bath. Bath. Bath. What's "a bath"? Una piscina. A swimming pool. Oh, I got it. A swimming pool. You're crazy. Hey, don't take too long! No, it's just a quick swim. Yes, a quick swim. See you afterwards. What's "see you afterwards"? Oh, nos vemos, see you later. Please, Mario. Don't feel bad. Why are you acting like this now? I can't send that girl to be killed. Why do you see it that way? Think about us. It's the last time, and then we'll be gone for ever. I know. Mario, please. We've done it before. What the hell! And that pervert couple pays well. I know. But it's my conscience... Even the toughest man feels guilty sometimes. You've fallen in love with that girl. Don't excuse yourself. That's not true. With the other women, it was easier. They were single women and they could easily end up this way. But she's so cheerful, so naive. Oh, Mario, it's our big chance. The last one. We can't waste it. We have to take this girl to the island. Please, Mario, please. Oh, God! It'll be the last time. The last time. I promise. Tell me you'll do it. Please, tell me you'll do it. Ah! Ah! Hi, Odile, how are you? Fine, I'm fine. Are you still reading that book? Oh, my book. Of course. Why haven't you come to see us. "See us?" I didn't get it. Very nice. Oh, you improved your English. Yes, because I like you. You are a pervert, but I love you. Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! These are the songs that King David used to sing to all the... Ha! Ha! Ha! Come on! Come to the water! It's too cold! No, it's not! It feels great! Uh! Ahh! Ha, ha, ha! It's wonderful here! Is that your friend's house? These are the songs that King David used to sing to all the... Ha, ha, ha! This is like a fairy tale, my God! These are the songs that King David used to sing to all the... Ha! Ha! Ha! No, Armando, don't insist. It's better if we don't see each other for some time. Come here to have dinner? No way. Are you crazy? Come on in! - Are you sure? - Of course. I have to go. I have company. I'll call you later. Here's our new friend. I'll introduce them. Odile Stevens, princess Bombaqui. It's a pleasure to meet you. Odile is American. - Don't I get a kiss? - Yes. - Have a seat, please. - Thank you. - Are you on holidays? - Oh, yes. You speak English wonderful. Just a little. I'm German and I understand something. Congratulations! Where did you find her? It wasn't easy. She's gorgeous. - Has she been here for a long time? - I don't know. As much as I've tried, I don't understand her. I imagine that you've already done it with her. Of course, and she's very good at it. Isn't it dangerous if she stays here, even if it's forever? No one will ask for her. She's completely on her own. How much do you want for her and for your silence? She's very different from what we brought you before. We are talking about you. Now it's me who doesn't understand anything. Ha! Ha! Ha! I don't know what you're saying. But I'm sure you know how much you'll ask for her. I hope we get to an agreement, considering the quality of the product. If only she knew what we're talking about. Come with me. We'll get you a dress to wear for lunch. Do you remember that poor girl? What was her name? Enriqueta, or something like that? Oh, yes! She was a disaster! She didn't understand anything either. And she was from Spain. I wonder where you found her. You may have gone to the other side of the world to find such an illiterate girl. It was terrible. Awful! After taking a bath, she didn't look so bad. No, no, she was a pretty girl. But I think she never realized what was going on. Well, she seemed to be enjoying it. - Do you want some? - Yes, please. Try some of this salad, it's delicious. Everything is from our garden. I could eat salads for ever. Do you like the salad, Odile? The salad is very good. I like it very much. She's lovely. Everything is fine for her. I sure think so. And you, Mara, don't you want a little bit more? Don't worry about me. I usually don't eat that much. That depends. You sure eat other things. Yes, but you're not going to compare that with a simple salad. Do you remember that time with the black girl from the ballet? Of course. My husband has always hated black people. We believe the whites are superior to other races. Maybe we're a little bit old-fashioned, but we just couldn't make love with a black woman. - You understand me, right Mario? - Yes, of course. Cheers. But we don't think the same about the Moors. I hate the Moors. They're dirty. Come on! Don't be racist! Don't forget that they worked on the wire fence in Granada. And they got so tired that they haven't taken a bath ever since. You're so cruel. Poor people. Some Spaniards are very dirty people, too. No, thanks, I never drink. Well, I like French women. They always smell really good. Don't be silly! - You want more? - No, thank you. But it's very famous, very good wine. Yes, but I never drink. I'll get drunk as a lord. - So what? - Ok, just to try. Anyway, I think that the eroticism has no limits. Sometimes a stupid and dirty person can be very attractive. Yes, I agree, but... a nice smell... - Try more. - No, please, it's very strong. - It's ok. - Oh, my God, I'm getting tipsy! Why not? But, darling, this is a Spanish party. Everybody is drunk! If you like, you can stay here. Stay here a month or two. - Can I borrow her, Mara? - Of course. - Right, Mario? - Of course. We can do it tonight, right? What do you think? Is Mario too busy? He's been a little silent lately, maybe he'll enter a monastery. Maybe. I'll be a nun if he does. I'm getting sick. I like your husband. You know? Excuse me. Your tie. You have no class. Odile! Odile! Oh, my God! I'm feeling sick! Take her to my room, now! Do you hear me? Help me. Let's go, be careful. I'll get her ready, the way you like it. Here. Where are you going? I don't want to see what they do to her. You can stay if you want. Mario! I can't! I can't! I can't! Help me! Let's go. We'll try again tomorrow, the way we like it. Come with me now. You're going to enjoy it, you'll see. You'll moan with pleasure. Think about us... Don't you hear her groan in pain? Yes! Don't you see her blooding breasts? Yes! Don't you see me slashing her with my whip? Yes! Ah! Ah! We'll kill all the inferior beings, but we'll enjoy with them! Ah! Ah! Ah! Yes, yes, yes! Ah! Ah! Hi! Hello. How are you? Did they hurt you? I don't understand you. - Do you understand me? - I don't know. I love you, Mario. I really do. Odile! Odile! Stop it! Let's go home. I won't tell the princess how and where I found you. Odile. What did you say? We'll talk later, Mario. Ah! Ah! Stay there! Don't move! Don't move! Did you hear me? No! Now you'll be much more docile. It can't be possible. Ah! Ah! Ha! Ha! Ha! No, please! No! No! Please! Ah! Ah! Ah! Pum! THE END
