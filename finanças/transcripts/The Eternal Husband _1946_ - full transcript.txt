THE ETERNAL HUSBAND The pulse is more regular. A crisis has been averted, but you need to take it easy. It's a serious thing, angina. No need, put all that away, Julie. - Very well, doctor. Why not convalesce in the countryside? That would be impossible. - Really? I have business to attend to. That's right. Important business. Don't work yourself up. At least try to distract yourself, go for walks. I'm telling you it's impossible. If I go out, I'll meet him again. In the street, in a restaurant, anywhere! Who's that? - I don't know! He's always in my way. Devious, grotesque with his false eye and his ridiculous round hat. You don't believe me, do you? Tell a doctor about your miseries and he smiles. An overactive imagination, eh? Well, no! He's watching me. He's spying on me. No, it's not my imagination. He follows me. He follows me everywhere. There, look! There, you see that, eh? You see that! My poor friend, it's the shadow of my hat and coat. Are you reassured now? Your nerves are in a sorry state. You need to rest. Drink this. It'll calm you down. Thank you. You'll feel better tomorrow. If you need me, your landlady will fetch me. Isn't that right, Julie? - Yes, doctor. And there's no man with a round hat not on the wall nor under your armchair, I assure you. Good night. - Good night. What do you want? What are you up to? Is it me you want? At this late hour? I'm exhausted. I can't see anyone. No one, understand? I need to rest. Some peace and quiet. The doctor said so. Don't get worked up. Sit down. No. Since you're exhausted, sit down. Can it really be? You don't recognise me? - No. For several days, I've been watching you for a glimmer of remembrance. Nothing. As I'm shy, discreet even... - Discreet? You come to my house in the middle of the night, you barge through my door... But it's perhaps better this way. Tell me what you want and finish this! Look at me. It was 8 years ago. Neubourg. Ring a bell? Nicolas! Yes, Nicolas. Ah, how you alarmed me. Really? How could I have recognised you? You weren't this large. You had sideburns, and you had hair. Yes, I had hair and lots of illusions. But you know, that losing one's hair changes a man less than losing his illusions? The thing that transforms us is misfortune. And alcohol too, I'll grant you but that's obvious. You drink these days? You who were a strict magistrate, punctillious... a stickler for virtue. Yes. I was all that but then... My poor wife... Nathalie? Last spring. Phthisis. 2 months. You're also much changed. I'm ill, very ill. Instead of coming directly to see me, why play this hide-and-seek of the last few days? Why? My dear Nathalie, you were fond of her, weren't you? - Yes. She was always very kind to me. Very kind, indeed. Do you mind? I handed in my notice. I sold everything. My furniture... my house. I left town... to forget. During the day, I bury my grief by looking at the people coming and going, the carriages going by. But at night, there's nobody to observe. And I need to talk about her. Who with? Therefore I came looking for you. - Me? Why me, eh? Why me? We haven't seen each other for ages. A friend like you, is sent by providence, don't you think? I know that in 8 years one can forget many important things. However you must remember her beautiful grey eyes... her long hair. Our little blue living room with the fireplace... and our three armchairs. Mine, hers and yours. You remember? Let me tell you again that I'm ill, at a low ebb and you're wearing me out! Are you really ill? Seriously? You who was so handsome, so vigorous. My wife who found you so attractive... Oh, I beg of you! Funny, talk of her agitates you and it makes me feel good. In the evening, I pay women to listen to me but they don't really hear. You catch my drift... do I have to spell it out, eh? Why are you telling me all this? What are you getting at? You recall those evenings under the lampshade where you read to us? My wife loved your voice. You remember how happy we were? Tell me, do you remember? What about it? If you could have seen how she wept when you left our small town. Are you blaming me?! I could never have comforted her if providence, once again, had not come to my rescue. She got to know a hussar. An officer of the hussars. But not like you, no. Shoulders... moustache... An iron constitution and a ferocious appetite. Therefore our dear Nathalie lost all interest in reading. She took up horse-riding. I don't give a damn about all this! Have I said something to upset you? You seem angry. - I'm not angry. I don't give a damn about your hussar and his moustache. All right... Let's put it down to your nerves. That's good, by the way. It would be good if the three of us met to talk about her. Oh no! I need peace and quiet. Haven't you realised? You talk of friendship and yet here you are pursuing me, exasperating me, with your tales of woe. I had nothing to do with it! I understand. You want me to go. You were nicer to me in Neubourg. I'll go. I'll go find Lisa. You do that! Go and seek consolation. What are you assuming? Lisa is my daughter. What? Nathalie and you had... ...a child, yes. Nathalie and me. I don't want to exhaust you. Good evening. Why didn't you tell me this earlier? Apart from your illness, nothing seemed to interest you. How old is she? She's... She was born a year after your departure. You left in... - September. The 16th. And Lisa was born May 10th. That makes... Here... That makes only 8 months. I hadn't realised. Lisa. Do you like the name? Lisa... Do you mind? Before I leave... It's cold out. She's a strange little girl. She's highly-strung. One wonders where she gets them from. Come. Come and see. Here. Look. How do you find her? It's a miniature we had made 3 years ago. Obviously she's changed since then. She's delightful. And what was the reaction of... Nathalie... ...when Lisa was born? I mostly remember my own joy. I told myself if my happiness and peace of mind should depart by God's grace, I'd still have Lisa. If you'd like to meet her, come and see us, 18 Rue des Remparts. If I'm out, ask the neighbour for the key. I leave it with her since the girl spent two days locked in. I didn't think to go back and the key was in my pocket. Good evening. Good evening. You'll drop by again? - Oh yes, one day next week. A hanged man! Look! What's going on? Who screamed? A hanged man! Hey, come and look! Someone's hanging! Hurry up and unhook him! Unhook him! Too late. Someone needs to alert the police. - I'll go. - How awful! Tell the landlord to get out here. Daddy. What are you doing there, Lisa? What are you doing here in the corridor so late in your night-shirt and with bare feet? This entertains you... ...a hanged man? Come on, you'll catch a chill. I'd locked you in. Who opened the door for you? Maria when she brought my dinner. You know I don't like you leaving the room. I wanted to see if you were coming. You haven't eaten? Why didn't you eat your soup? When you're not here, I'm not hungry. So I have to return at the appointed hour to watch you eat? To hold your spoon? It's all cold. It was warm earlier. Put your slippers on. Do I have to think of everything? All you do is disobey me. Is that good? You say that because I'm here with you and you're happy. Daddy? - Yes. Why did that man hang himself? You're intrigued by that, eh? Maybe the man had run out of money. Maybe... he had a little girl who gave him too much trouble. A little girl like you. He didn't want her to leave the room but she went out. A little girl who cried when he left... And who cried... when he didn't come back. Maybe too... he had a wife... and a friend. A good friend sent by providence. So the gentleman had had enough and he was correct. I'm going to do the same as him. Daddy... Shush, belt up. Not on the stairs, it would embarrass the tenants. Here... while you eat your soup. It's sturdy. Do you think that it'll serve to hang myself? You see, it's easy... to make a noose. Eh, Lisa? He has a large head, your father, eh? Your little darling daddy. You like hanged men. You'll see the hanged man. Here'll do just fine You'll see... wait... until I get a black tongue, all right, Lisa? Wait, help me. Lisa... give me your chair. Give me your chair, Lisa! Papa, please! No, daddy! Shush! Don't cry like that. I won't hang myself if you promise me you'll never go out without my permission... Yes, daddy. ...that you'll eat your soup even when I'm out and that you won't disobey me anymore. Let go of me! How many times have I told you not to cry? Go to bed. Go to bed. And try to get to sleep, at once! I'll try, daddy. Close your door! Are you going out again? No. You promise? Go to sleep! And I don't want to hear you again. You're a friend of my son's, aren't you, sir? A great friend, madam, but I haven't seen him for many years. Alas you've arrived too late. What? Am I to understand?... He's next door. Still alive... But the doctor's given me no reason for hope. An accident? - No, congestion. On the way back from a good friend's house where almost every day he spent the evening. Like with us. Such a strong boy... so cheerful. And so seductive. You knew Mathias well? Yes. So did my wife. They got on very well, those two. And now he's very ill... and my poor Nathalie... These are terrible trials, aren't they? Terrible. I've rediscovered two good friends, I wanted to reunite them. One's not very well and the other... Life is decidedly strange... or decidedly terrible. He isn't married? - No. He claimed women are not faithful enough. His spare time, he spent it collecting. Weapons... They're everywhere. And butterflies. - Butterflies? Here, in the displays. You see, he was a sentimentalist. He himself impaled each one on its pin. Tender and sentimental. And scrupulous. That's three words that sum him up. When one thinks that under God's finger, he's now like one of these butterflies. Sir shouldn't say that. I'd like to see him for a moment. He's a shadow of his former self Hollowed out, burning with fever. Does he feel as if he's dying? Alas. Madam, allow me to open the door so I can see him one last time. Perhaps in his agony he will recognise me, this good, this dear, this scrupulous Mathias. Do you mind? Faster! - Hurry up! Why don't you play with us? - I don't feel like it. What's up, Frédéric, you coming? He's out. Not unexpectedly. And his daughter? She's in the courtyard. If you'd like to wait for them... - No, I couldn't impose. Oh, I'm used to it. Come in. You'll have to excuse me, I'm doing the cleaning. Are you family? - A friend. Have a seat on the bed, it commits you to nothing. Do you know Lisa well? Of course. It was me who sent her out for some fresh air while that other one, I mean your pal, is out God knows where. Crossing the courtyard, didn't you see Lisa? I wouldn't recognise her. That's what I wanted to ask you, which one is she? The one sitting there, on her own. She's smaller than she should be for her age. She's not doing well. Won't you call her? - Of course. Lisa! Here, come up. Why doesn't she play with the others? - Oh, she never does. After the life he's made for her, she hasn't a passion for games. It looks like she's cold... - No... More like she's scared. Scared? Why? Always kept cooped up. And when he comes back and he's drunk... Of course, it's none of my business. I take care of her when I can. However I can't keep her with me when I'm working. He doesn't love her? - Love... And she doesn't care for him? She loves him. Children are not like us, they get attached. Here she is. Come in! This is a friend of your daddy's. He's very nice. Say hello. - Come on, Lisa. Don't be afraid. Come and say hello. Well, go on then. Won't you give me your hand? There. This one, at least, won't cause you any pain. You're a darling, my Lisa. You look like your mummy. Yes, your grey eyes are like hers. Has anyone ever told you that? You don't speak. Why? Whose voice do you have? I'm not used to talking with children. I haven't brought you any toys. I don't know any stories. But if you like, we could be friends. And I'll learn some nice stories. For you alone. Whisper in my ear what you'd most like. You don't want to help me make you happy? Carry on.. Daddy! I didn't know you were so fond of children. She loves me, you know. Aren't you ashamed of her clothes, of how thin she is, of her sadness? Don't shout like that. You'll frighten her. The gentleman is unwell. He can't help it, his nerves are shot. Ignore it. Come to mine. I've come from Mathias' house. Remember, the hussar, the moustache... For your entertainment, I wanted to arrange a small meal for three. However it's impossible, poor Mathias, he's already in a coma. He's going to die. This is where Lisa lives? In this dump! It's not as good as Neubourg. At our poor Nathalie's. But you're happy with me, aren't you? - Oh yes, daddy. You see. The spitting image of her mummy. Her eyes... and her mouth. You remember my wife's mouth? She's nothing from me, not even my personality. She's highly-strung, as I already told you. Where does she get this from, eh? Have a seat. You leave her alone for days on end! Mate, there are places where in all decency I can't take her. Lisa, get us two clean glasses. The child needs fresh air, sunlight. She needs someone to take care of her, to look after her. "Someone"? Who's this "someone"? You, perhaps? Why not me? Why do you blame me? Say it! She can't stay in these ghastly lodgings. In this neighbourhood. You aren't going to keep her in this environment? Listen. I've cousins in the country. They have 4 children. If I asked them to take in a fifth, I'm sure they'd agree. It isn't far, and you could go visit as often as you liked. Is this why you've come? To take her away from me? Would you like that, Lisa? I want to stay with you. You'd have a pretty garden with nice friends. You know, it'd be lots of fun. No. You daddy would visit you all the time. So would I. Truly, it's love at first sight. However leaving her like that with strangers... While you're getting settled down. Put that way, I can't refuse. It makes my heart ache. But as it's for her own good... Lisa, pack your things, you're leaving. You really want to? Right now? I've always trusted you, Michel. And it moves me that you have such intentions towards a little girl you hardly know. Who is nothing to you. Go and find a carriage... meanwhile I'll persuade her... gently. She'll be happy, I promise you. Daddy... I don't want to go. It's your fault, Lisa. You shouldn't have complained. But I said nothing. You're sad. You're pale. If you were cheerful with nice rosy cheeks, nobody would be suggesting this. Daddy... I don't want to leave you. You want to cause me more grief? To have me accused of being selfish? Turn down a nice holiday you've been offered? Lisa, pack your suitcase right now or I'll get angry! You'll have more fun here, I'm telling you. You've heard? I bumped into your friend on the stairs. He must have been a ladies' man, that one. You find him attractive? More so than me, eh? Alluring and handsome. You're not jealous, are you? - Oh, I'm used to it. There are men all women find attractive... and then there are the rest. It's curious how women don't distinguish between a handsome man and a good man. You want something to drink? Oh, I wouldn't say no. Lisa, get a move on! Excuse me. So, you're letting her go just like that? - Yes. It is a good idea of his. Obviously, the country will do her good. That remains to be seen. A little girl is less easily seduced than a woman. It may turn out that separated from me she'll be more miserable than here. Keep her. - No. He'll discover she's not happy there and she's sorry she went... Above all, that she misses me. You see? Not everyone's as complicated as you. I used to be an ordinary chap. Only a year ago when she cried, it pierced my heart. Then one day... Maria, you wouldn't go and buy me another bottle, please? See you soon, Lisa. Is your bag ready? I can't find my socks. Try and find them. I saw them under the dresser. The carriage is downstairs. All that's left to do is close her bag. - Let me do it. Be careful she doesn't catch a chill. She gets fevers for no reason. Make sure she has regular meals. When she's sleeping, she likes someone to stay near her bed. Come on, come on... Am I crying? Make it clear to your cousins why I'm entrusting her to you. Tell them everything. As they have children... they'll understand me... perhaps. Kiss your daddy, Lisa. You think that without your help she'd forget to? At this age they are loyal. I didn't think you had so much heart. Yes. The heart of a father, you know what that is. You're always making insinuations! Say it straight for once! The gentleman's getting agitated again. He'll work himself into a rage. Come on, Lisa, time to go. Michel, I thank you for all your kindness. We'll see each other again soon. Give me your hand. - No. Lisa, show your manners. You'll come and see me? - Yes. Tomorrow? - Yes. Tomorrow. Missed! My turn now! It's my turn! 1... 2... 3... 4. You're too close, you're cheating. It won't count! - Stand on the mark. Oh, leave off! Missed! Not by much. Watch this one. Uncle Michel! Hello, children. Uncle Michel! Uncle Michel! Hello, uncle Michel. Hello, girlie. Isn't your mummy here? - She's in the house. And Lisa? - She's over there. Where? - On the terrace. She's not playing with you? - She doesn't like playing. She must be persuaded. She knows you well enough by now. Carry on playing. I'll be back to see you later. Carry on the game. - You'll see, I'll win. It's my turn now. - No, it's mine... How are you doing? How about you? You've come alone? He always finds a good reason not to come with me. Is she still asking for him? Not since yesterday. But she has a way of remaining silent... - Yes, I just saw her. When she realised it was me, she pretended to be asleep. And I pretended to believe she's sleeping. This is where we've got to. Insist that he comes. - I have done, 10 times. He always makes the same lamentations: the evenings with Nathalie, Lisa doesn't look like him. Always hinting, making innuendos. Explain it to him once and for all. Tell him it's not true. It is true, Marie. I was passionately in love with Nathalie. Undoubtedly, he knows... but he lacks proof. He hovers around me like an investigating magistrate. He wants me to confess. What good would it do me to tell him everything? For a year, every day I betrayed him as much as I could to his face! However he lacks evidence. He doesn't dare take it out on me so he takes his revenge on Lisa. On a child! When he entrusted her to me, he knew full well what he was doing. Lisa hates me, as he wanted. Slowly he lets her wither away... so that I suffer. And there's nothing I can do for her. Her health worries me. But what can I do? You can imagine what this is doing to me, I was already ill. Lisa must take priority. Michel... Be patient. Reason with him. If you can... get him to come. Lisa needs his presence. Ah when he's in front of me, smiling, lachrymose, hideous... I want to scream at him: you shouldn't have put that band on your hat, it should be on your cuckold's horns like a banner! Believe me, you need to bite your tongue. If you talk like that, he'll never come. Thank you. Thank you. I've been looking for you all day. To offer me your condolences? Thank you. To tell you once again Lisa is asking for you. Are you surprised? Her depression is eating away at her. You promised to come. She needs you. This frustrates you and disappoints you. Are you jealous, by any chance? Jealous of what? Of whom? I find it unworthy that you disregard your daughter. You confined her, mistreated her. It's a lie. I had a lot of affection and kindness for her... Before. - Before what?! Speak, answer! Before what? A most handsome man, don't you think? The three of us are finally reunited. Nathalie would be happy if she could see us. She loved Mathias. When she was delirious... she talked. What? When she was about to die... - Yes. She confessed her wrongdoings? - Yes. Citing names? - Yes. More than one? No... She didn't say anything. She didn't name anyone. Aren't I fun to be with? A drunkard is what you are! I can't tell when you're lying. You're trying to sully the memory of your wife with these supposed confessions. A woman who respected you. I speak of people as they merit. Don't worry, I have evidence. Evidence? The evening Nathalie died, I found a box. It contained all the letters from Mathias with numbers. A reason to rejoice. Did the box contain other letters? No. Let's go, you don't belong here. Come on. Why? Lisa needs you. She's all you think about. If you don't come right now, she will get really ill. That would be upsetting... but I can't. I must go with Mathias to the cemetery. You see, I owe him a shovelful of dirt from our friendship. All right... but what about after the cemetery? I'm begging you. Take pity on her! Pity? Why pity? Nobody ever took pity on me. Don't take it out on her. She's just a child. I'll wait as long as you like, but come today. This evening. I can't this evening. I'm having a meal in town. You're doing this deliberately, aren't you? To see how far I'll go because of the child's suffering. What an overflowing heart you have. One might say that the moment you saw Lisa, you had a revelation of what's meant by fatherly affection. If you please, family members and friends for the transportation of the body. Excuse me, I don't want to miss this. Mummy, you're hurting me. - Come on, don't be such a softie. Mathilde, it's in your best interests. You need to look your best. The friend coming for dinner this evening is a delightful man. More importantly... he's a widower. The idea of remarrying isn't one he finds disagreeable. You know how difficult it is for a father of 8 grown daughters to have as a guest someone in this happy state of affairs. You don't have a dowry. Neither do your sisters. - I know, dad. How old is he? In his fifties. At least not yet 60. But he is cultured, sensible, level-headed... Your mother will tell you these are the most precious qualities in a husband. Amélie, tell her I'm right. - Your father is right. What is love? An illusion. Youth? Something ephemeral. By not marrying someone you love, you avoid the disappointment when you find you don't love them anymore. To tell you anything different, your mother will confirm would be quite wrong. Amélie? Your father would be quite wrong. It's not my intention to marry you off against your will. However... Think of your sisters. Of your parents... in their humiliation. Mathilde, you're no longer a child. Listen, the peroration before the appeal to duty. ...I appeal to your sense of duty... Well... it'll introduce us to a funny sort of suitor. 60 years old. If you feel like it, girls... Have you noticed? Every 6 months, the fiance offered to Mathilde gets 5 years older. Poor thing. - Another one of dad's colleagues. When it's my turn, I'll tell him: no bailiffs, no judges, no solicitors. They're too old. Clotilde, pass my garters. You're right. A husband ought to be young. Love first and money second. You know mum stuffed some wadding in Mathilde's blouse? To make her more buxom. More appealing. A warning: I just turned the turkey in the oven, it's shrunk. In serving yourself, proceed moderately. Yes, but there'll be plenty of bread. Will someone help tie my corset? They've taken my comb again. I've had enough of this! Quiet! I hear a carriage. Is it him? - He's here. Prince Charming in his carriage. If the gentleman would like to take a seat. I'll fetch sir immediately. My dear friend, forgive me. I was engrossed in a file. At the moment I'm deluged in work. Nice house with a pretty garden, I believe? An old property of the family. Please, have a seat. It's very nice here. What's holding you back from getting all this refurbished and repainted? My wife is a sentimentalist. An old sofa, a broken armchair are for her not so much furniture as memories. But on the other hand, our girls are very up-to-date. And our eldest, Mathilde... - How old is she? 26. It's a good age. One where promises are kept. The idea of us being separated is very painful for me and my wife. But one day... birds leave the nest. Amélie, you know our friend. Hasn't he changed? He seems even younger. Madam, my respects. And this is Mathilde. Our dear Mathilde. Delightful. She's tall for her age. The fever has declined a little. You're better, aren't you? You're still sick? Here, take your potion. It'll do you good. Take me away... You need a good night's sleep and tomorrow you'll feel better. Your forehead's not so warm. Aren't you sleepy? I want to go back to him. Maybe it's the light keeping you awake. Don't worry, I'm close by. Sleep. Where is he? I haven't a clue! I must find him at any cost. But I told he hasn't been back for two days. He's out enjoying himself. At his age, they step it up a notch. Nobody's seen him at 'Au Poisson d'or' nor at Mme Olga's. There must be somewhere else he could be! We two never see each other. Isn't that a shame? I'm not in the mood to fool around. Oh you, you're never in the mood to fool around. Try to understand, I have to find him. I'll bring him by force, knock him out if I have to. You two are a pair of jokers. Always chasing after each other although you do nothing but fight. You're not bad when you're angry. - Where is he? You'll come and see me? - Where is he? Oh you! When you're fixed on something... - Lisa is ill. The kid? What's up with her? - Who knows? She's been asking for him for days. Where can he be hiding? Try looking behind the wine market. I wouldn't be surprised... A small house with a crooked roof and weird shutters. Behind the wine market? Ladies... Look at this. A gold coin, brand new. You can see, yes? So... silence. The presti... prestidigitator... And there, no more. Well, the coin will belong to the one who can find it. Up your sleeve! Illusionist! - You're tickling me... Who's this? - He's not bad. Is he your friend? But what does he want with you? May I introduce you to Mme Irma's lodgers. Sir... This time you're coming, get me? Lisa is very ill. Lisa is very ill? - She clamours for you desperately. Come on. If that's how it is, I'm coming but not so rough! Ladies, excuse me but my duty as a father calls me elsewhere. Get a move on! - Don't talk to me like that! I'm a bit drunk. It's Mme Irma's champagne... Plus I'm upset. Learning all of a sudden that one's beloved daughter... it's good at times like this to have close to one a sincere friend like you. To our old friendship, Michel! You're disgusting. You repulse me. He says this... but it's not true. However low I fall, you will not condemn me, you! Let's embrace. Cut it out! You play the clown while Lisa waits for you. We're going. Give me my things, it's cold. This is not the moment for jokes. Goodbye, my angel. - See you tomorrow. Goodbye, dearie. - See you soon. My umbrella. Ah, here it is. Ladies... my respects to Mme Irma. What about the gold coin? They're sweet, eh. Whoever can catch it. There it is, I've got it! Watch out! It's mine! Look how funny she is. - Don't touch! I'm not going to break it! Hold on, I'll wind it up. Careful, you'll damage it! Oh, give it a rest! Not so much noise. And you've been told not to play with this. You'll wake up Lisa, that's bad. I shouldn't have to tell you. isn't she better, Lisa? - About the same. Can I show her her doll tomorrow? I'll tell you tomorrow. Now to bed, or I'll get angry. Come on, move it! One moment, hey! You push me, pull me... I need to catch my breath! Good... We're here. She's upstairs. Exactly. Let me get my breath back. This is good. Nice place, neat and tidy. And yet she was less happy here than in my slum. My cousin has done everything to look after her. I want a drink. - Have you no shame? I want a drink. It's not a crime, I'm emotional. You get watery eyes, I get a dry throat. Physical phenomena are different according to the individual. You've swore to push me to the brink, now watch it! Don't shout, she's up there. You'll frighten her again. Please, come on. When I've had a drink. Just one little drinky. Coming to see a dying child, it's appalling. Here... I saw her when she was as small as this. Then... growing up. Oh, how I loved her... And how I fretted... at a chill... at a cut or a scrape. And when she's dying, you want a drink. That's not the same at all. Not the same at all. Good stuff. One more little drinky. If I had a weapon to hand, I'd kill you. There have been times as well when I'd gladly have killed you. One more little drinky and I'll do whatever you want. Can she still talk? Barely. The most dreadful thing is to see her look turning inwards. When I move close to her, she doesn't even see me. She is engrossed in her memories... when we were happy. We had our secret language... our own games. This is good, eh? Oh, I can see your game! Lisa is waiting for you. Only you can save her. And you want to drag it out, right? Make it last as long as possible! Have me grovelling on my knees! What are you making up now? Scoundrel! You don't have the nerve to kill me so you're going after her. You're stupid. You're saying that... Well, what are you saying? - We'll discuss it later. I beg you, think only of her now. When you talk more reasonably, you get what you want. Come on... Are there many stairs to climb? - It's on the first floor. Michel... You think it'll do her good to see me? It's our last chance. That's a shame because on reflection... I'm not doing it. There's only 5 metres left. I'm not doing it. I'm stopping here. - You are crazy! You have no right to inflict such upset on a father. I'll see her when she's well. If you want more to drink, I'll give you as much as you like, but come on. You think I'm a drunkard! It's the upset that's making me weak at the knees. She must have heard your voice. She's probably watching the door. She's dying and you won't... Yes. Her suffering is over. You mean to say... that my little Lisa... It's all over. She died clutching this in her little hand. I'll have it stitched up. Madam, thank you... for all that you've done for her. I will reimburse you for all the burial costs. You'll accompany her to the cemetery. I don't have the courage. I want it to always have fresh flowers and that the grave be well-maintained. You can rely on me, sir, it will be done as is our custom. Thank you, see you tomorrow. - Goodbye, sir. Just a jug of water and a glass. - Gladly, sir. Ah there, I got you! Schoolboy prank. I feel rather childish today. Drunk again, I see. Once again. A little decorum. Remember your grief. Which one? So much misfortune overwhelms me... I can't keep track. Leave me alone, I've nothing more to say to you. Why are you avoiding me? I've been looking for you for 8 days. Just because Lisa is dead doesn't mean there's nothing else between us. Still ill? If you stopped exasperating me, I might get better. At least respect the memory of Lisa. Our joint mourning of Nathalie upsets you? I don't like to dwell on Lisa. We're quits. A bottle and 2 glasses. I paid the expenses, of a nice funeral supplied the provisions to celebrate her memory. And you rubbed your hands together like it was a job well done. No more talk about that little Lisa on whom you were relying for a reason to live. To be loyal... To erase perhaps a shady past. Lisa regarded you as a stranger. She died considering you an intimidating gentleman. Nothing more. Oh, I understand that you wept when you saw her cold, purple little fingers. Won't you stop all this now! Have you swore to drive me mad?! What exactly is it you want? You want me to kill myself? Above all... that you don't kill yourself. Sit down. Listen to me. My dear... My dearest Michel, I've decided on a change of scene. You're leaving at last! - Yes. My sweet friend... I'm remarrying. Impossible! You lost your wife but a few months ago. But I'm not marrying right away. I'm happy to have a pledge. Don't I have the right to a little happiness? The father is a disgraced magistrate.. I've already been received into the family with the bowing and scraping of matchmakers. 8 girls. The eldest is 26. At 26, you can expect better than a widower past his best. The eldest isn't the one that interests me. I can purchase the one I like and I feel like a 25 year old. The one I like is the youngest, Agathe. 17 years old. I'll make that little bird mine by early next summer. You disgust me. Don't walk off, I need you. To buy a child? Never! Listen to me. Don't go storming off. - I'm not storming off. All the better... After what's happened between us, you could do me a small favour. What has happened between us? - What? You're a connoisseur. I've never been married. - Yes... but you don't disdain married women? We'll go like two good friends to spend the day with this kind family. You're mad. Is this what you want from me? What attitude will Agathe have towards you? How will she comport herself? Interesting problem, very important to me. This time, I mustn't be mistaken. I refuse. Make one last effort and I swear it'll all be over between us. What will be over? Say it, right now! Come on, in a few hours our account will be conclusively settled. And the band? Should I keep it or take it off? I'll take it off. For a fiancé, it's more jolly. Come. Don't feel you have to. But I don't mind, miss, on the contrary. Thank you. You would make a housewife... - ... of some repute. Thank you. With pretty little hands... - Shush! It's by Schubert. Which one? Whichever one you choose. For you, the best. Seems to be going well. Let's hope God's listening. Are you thinking of getting married? - Definitely not. I knew it at once. You're not like your friend. It's strange, usually my artistic number is an embarrassment for me. But not in your case. I wonder why. Because I love music. But if you've had enough... - Daddy would be furious. Mathilde seems less clumsy than usual. Does that gentleman have a good situation? I don't know the details. But for Mathilde, he'd do fine. Get ready to applaud, the recital is about to end. Bravo. Mr. Schubert is very good. Is Mathilde the only one with such divine talent? We've given each one a little speciality. Not to keep them busy but more as a distraction, because idle hands... You Agathe, do you make music too? Yes... Drumming, in my spare time. Agathe, I don't like that sort of quip and would ask you to be quiet. Don't scold my little favourite. I've something to give you. Here... a small gift. A little token... It's for you. Do you mind? But of course. - Of course. Open it. It has a small catch. Do you like it? - Say "thank you". Thank you. A bracelet! And in gold! Come and see, Ernest. Without looking, I'm sure it's excellent. How splendid. It's a top drawer item. Show your sisters how spoiled you are. It doesn't concern them! And I don't want it! What did you say? What did you dare say? You and mummy have told us a thousand times that young girls don't wear jewelry until they come of age. That's not the issue! A bracelet like this, one accepts it with gratitude. And you put it on your wrist happily. You hear me! Please... With gratitude! And happily! What was that all about? Just a tiny tantrum. The poor child is a little highly-strung. Yes... it's the stress. - We'll see about that! Sorry, you wouldn't mind if I took care of this? You? - With your agreement, of course. Good idea. He's very good at talking with women. I well know why you're crying. You? I doubt it. The idea of having such a husband alarms you. You're ashamed of your parents. Ashamed of being sold off by people you love. Isn't that it? Yes. You see that you can trust me. I hate him. I'll never be his wife. Never. If my father insists, then... Wouldn't matter who, eh? The first you saw. Yes. How you must be cursing us. - Not you. You're not like him. Don't cry anymore, come on. You'll marry a man you love. - You think so? - Oh yes. And don't sulk. It's a waste of energy. Would you allow me to give you a word of advice? Oh yes. Well, it's this... If your father... Am I interrupting? She is comforted. The tantrum has passed? - Forgotten. Good, I knew it would be. Michel, this reminds me of the first time you came to my house. It was about a trial, I think. You were about to leave in a huff, Nathalie intervened and you stayed. Your sisters are waiting for you in the garden to play blindman's buff. You like blindman's buff? - It's my favourite game. You can prepare for them a nice little meal. Peace has broken out. - God, I was worried! We might manage two on the same day. Ernest, you're perhaps a trifle over-optimistic. Blindman's buff... at their age! Look out, here he comes! The last here is it! He's the one who's it. It's you. - I protest, you might've said. No, it's you! - Let's go! I'll catch you all right. - Tie it tight. Okay? - Yes, okay. Watch out, stand back everyone. Ready? Look out, first spin around twice. I don't know where I am. To the left... - To the right... Behind you... They're all over, I can't find one. Over here... Move it, come on! Faster! Watch out, he'll catch you! Be careful! Quick! You did that deliberately, didn't you? Who did that, eh? It was me, Anna. - It was me, Lily. It was me, Lucie. It was me, the chief justice. Come on, we'll hide together. He'll never find us. That's not very fair. - Who cares?! Everyone for himself. - Yes, let's split. Come on. Where are you? Don't go far! Was that far? You go that way, I'll go this. He'll be searching until nightfall. It's not very kind to him. - Too bad, this'll teach him. Little bitches. Michel! Agathe! You think he'll be angry? - I'm afraid so. And are you angry? - No. For the favour I'm about to do you, certain faults can perhaps be forgiven. Can I tell you everything? - Please do. You took pity on me. The feeling embarrasses me. I'd rather... that you had acted... out of compassion. But it was out of compassion. There is in you, Agathe, a grace, a fire that stirs me. And then I think of him. To let him sully you would not only be revolting, it would be shameful. You are kind. Look what I sat on. A horseshoe. We can make a wish. A secret wish. - Agreed. Have you done so? Yes. For this to work, you have to throw it over your shoulder. No! The left shoulder! Will you visit us again? Yes, if you invite me. Yes. My sisters like you too. You know I've barely noticed them because you were there. That's very nice, Michel. I've only known you for a few hours... and it feels already as if my whole life has been transformed. Coo-ee! - You again! It's always you! But the game was to find you. To surprise us, at God knows what. I simply wanted to return this to you. Have you made a wish? Are you starting up again with your innuendos and smirking? I've nothing to say to you. To our charming Agathe, a quick word. Beware of men like him. Listen to them, you'll soon become a lodger of Mme Irma's. It's amusing but it's less fun for the husband. Go home right now or I'll inform your father. Go on! This is a bit much. You begged me to talk to her. I did it as a favour to you and you insult us. When will you know what you want? For once, you have a point. - For once! With Lisa, you acted like a monster. With Agathe, like a supreme boor. But this time it's over! Finished. Almost. Be careful though, you're developing a bit of a fever. The doctor told you not to get over-excited. I'm unwell, leave me alone. The sweaty forehead... the livid complexion... You remind me of poor Mathias two days before his death. Mathias now!... You promised me at the cemetery that you'd leave me in peace after this. What do you want this time? To finish this once and for all as agreed, but not in a stable, with you unsteady on your feet. Go home. We were going to have dinner here. Your health takes priority. Come on. Lean on me. Don't tremble. Don't worry. Let's not go via the house. This way. I hope that during this dinner you will all behave respectably. No talking over each other. Above all, no giggling or else... One carafe at a time. I will serve the wine myself, as and when the need arises. Very nice flowers. Where's your mother? She's doing Mathilde's hair. Putting more wadding in her blouse. Did anyone ask your opinion? Listen to me carefully. During the hors-d'oeuvres, you'll serve... Ah there you are! Is it just you? - Yes. Come here! Where are they? They've gone. - Gone? How can they have gone? Without saying goodbye? Why? - They had a quarrel. Because of what? Are they coming back? Come on, this can't be. Was the quarrel because of you? Well, look at her! She's to blame. She's definitely to blame! This presumptuous girl didn't find this marriage to her taste and they've left. They've left! You know what you are? A wretched girl. Michel... We've arrived. How are you feeling? - I'm getting worse and worse. I'm here. I'll come up with you. - I'd rather be alone. What if it's serious? I don't want to leave you. I'll come up with you. Come on. Careful. Come on. I'll pay. Here. - Thank you, sir. Come on. Weird customers. Giddy up. We're going back. Slowly... You don't want to lie down? - No. I'd feel it weighing down on me even more. Your teeth are chattering. A drop to drink? - No. But you know where the bottle is. Thanks, but not tonight. I've something serious to attend to What? - Taking care of you. No, call my landlady instead. The doctor has explained to her how to apply suction cups. No need to disturb her, I can do it. Where are they? - On the dresser over there. Don't you have some medicine to take? Yes, the black bottle. 5 drops, no more. In some water. 2... 3... 4... 5. Drink. There are moments when you are almost touching. I'm mostly good by nature. I have to force myself to be wicked. It's even more praiseworthy of me. I'll do the suction cups. The box on the dresser. In the carriage, when you became ill, I understood what it is that separates us. Michel... I am the eternal husband type and you are the eternal seducer type. We don't choose what type we are. We must kill each other, or come to terms with it. Which is better? That's the big question. Don't you have some cotton wool? Over there, in the first drawer. It's bizarre, isn't it, that I kept trying to see you I hate you. And yet I couldn't quite bring myself to leave you alone, I admire you. When you came to my home, I marvelled at your actions, at your wit, at your jokes. Ah, I envy you... I wish I gave as much pleasure. Those young girls who were mocking me earlier, were you on their side? Why were you cruel to me? I played blindman's buff with them so they wouldn't think I was too old. I was ridiculous but you didn't help me out. And when I fell, you laughed too. You've never done me anything but harm. You took everything from me. And still I care for you. I never asked you to! Get out! Get out, why don't you?! No. Firstly, swear to me that you'll never see Agathe again. Of course I swear it. You realise, that would be too risky for me. You still count on marrying Agathe? She'll refuse. How do you know that? Is that what she was confiding to you in the barn? - No! In the barn she gave me your bracelet, so I could return it to you. She gave it to you better to humiliate me. Why didn't you tell me this earlier? To not hurt your feelings. - No, the better to scorn me. Why did you drag me there? So I could give you my advice? Oh come on! You wanted revenge. You wanted to show me your fiancée so you could tell me: this one's mine, all mine. Just try to take her from me. Well, it backfired. Too bad for you. To kill each other... or come to terms with it. That's what it boils down to... As if you were capable of coming to terms. To make someone die... Yes, that's it! That's it... Continue your game. Your underhanded game. To exhaust me, to where I expire. Like Mathias. Like Lisa. But I won't let it happen. I will stand my ground. Do you want some more drops? No, ether. Where is the ether? In the bathroom cabinet, hurry! Yes. Hurry, speed yourself. Hurry! Yes... I'm coming. Ether, quick! I'm suffocating. Scoundrel! Go and call the police. You do it... I won't. We are not alike. Thank you. - Get out. Take it. It's a letter... that my wife wrote to you... before Lisa was born. She kept it in her box. "Michel..." "I'm about to have a child by you." "You have to forget about it..." "because if my husband knew the truth..." "he'd be terribly unhappy." Farewell. We can do terrible things when we're terribly unhappy.
