Senor Garmes, you're right in time. Yes. Good catch? Only fair, there is a north wind. If isn't the wind, it's the temperature, If isn't the temperature, it's the moon. All three are never right. Even so, the best fish in the Atlantic end up in our boat. Miguel... ... I'm going away tomorrow. Only for a short time. A vacation, senor? No, business trip. Anything you need for the boat? No. She will float until you get back. God willing. When you come back, I'm gonna cook you a mullet you can eat without fear. With a little pain afterwards. You are very ardent. It happens. What was the occasion? Was it your birthday, or mine? I didn't think whores were impressed by such manners. Oh, come... You are telling me I don't notice the difference between you and... ... old Gomez, the dentist? Or me and young Belasco, the croupier? He hasn't got your strength. I'll bet you say that to all the boys. I do. The men don't come here to be insulted. They come to get away from their wives, or the mothers of their wives. Or their children, their work... Or... Just put me down as a creature of necessity. Was your wife good in bed? She didn't snore. Was she pretty? "A body of silver and silk, and eyes the color of gentians." That is a lovely thing to say. Well, her boyfriend had a very nice turn of phrase. She left some of his old letters behind. But you did love her. It's all in the past. It's better left. Keep this for me, will you? What is it? Something I want you to keep while I'm gone. - Where are you going? - Just business. You are driving again for criminals? I'm driving again for me. 'Cause I'm getting ready to die sitting down here. And driving again, I can see if my nerves and my brain are still connected. That's why I've... You're right about the people that are paying me. You're right... They are criminals. Is it stolen? Is that why you gave it to me? No, no. It's just that it's real money. It's not bank money. If you were to look very closely under the picture of Benjamin Franklin you would see that it said: "This proves Harry Garmes is still alive" And if it should happen to prove otherwise, consider it yours. - When do you go? - Tomorrow morning Come back later. I have two more customers but I will cut it short. Come back, and I will cook you something that doesn't taste of sardines. Thanks, but I have things to do. This work, is it dangerous? No, just transportation. Are you catholic? In the old days, before the fall, I owned a few shares. I will pray for you. You think it would do no good to have a whore pray for you? "She's not a whore... who sleeps a bed with thee, and he, and me. She's a whore... who has the heart of a whore." Believe me, I know. Father, I've sinned. Not that there was something else, it's not the same then. Lately I, haven't done much of anything. I don't believe much. But there's this thing I have to, and I wanna do it right. It's the only thing I know. It's for money. But I would like to do it right. That's all. Do you want to confess to, my son? No, thank you, Father. No need. I already took care of it.. Get them out! Quick! Come on, faster. Come on! Get in the back. Okay, you can come out now. It made me wish I was back in the Penitentiary! There's some clothes right here in the back. - Are we going through Vallaposa? - It's not on our route. Change of plans. We got business in Vallaposa. - What kind of business? - Fun business. Happy business. It isn't everyday you break out of stir. Hey, that was pretty good back there. They way they put it together. That's what I call first class. - What's in Vallaposa? - Don't worry. You're just the taxi driver. I'm the passenger, I tell you where to go. You just keep your hands on the wheel so everything looks right. Hey, that's pretty freaky. What are we doing when we get to Vallaposa? We pick up my girl. Nobody told me anything about a girl. That's because they didn't know anything about a girl. Just like they don't know what it's like to be munching with a bunch of nuts and perverts. Don't worry. - What's your name anyway? - Garmes. - Harry Garmes. - Everything's gonna be okay, Harry Nobody'll be upset with you as long as you do what you were hired to do. Which is to drive. Did you bring me a gun? That's another thing they didn't tell me anything about. Did you think they'd send you postcards when I went to the can? What are you, some kind of robot? They sure are making safe-blowers tough nowadays. What did you do, bite through the locks? What's with the safe-blower? You told me that's your trade. I don't blow boxes, man. I blow heads. When I say bang, everything gets suddenly dark! Not bad. Not bad at all. Hello? Room 301, please. Claudie? Yeah. Fine, no trouble. 106. Yeah. Come on down and bring my things. Great. I'll be waiting, baby. Hey! Sexy! Who's your tailor? Think he could make a pair of these? Hey, don't go making yourself too comfortable. After all, it's been 9 months and I got a feeling you snore. You don't talk a lot do you, Harry? Have you ever worked for these guys before? Because I sure never have heard of you. Who is it? It's me. Don't go. I'd like you to meet your niece Uncle, niece, nieces boyfriend. I'll get you the bottle. That's alright, I'll get a drink upstairs. Okay, but there's a some things I want to ask you... ... Uncle. Did you say you'd worked with these guys before? No, I haven't. Then who was you last number with? - You wouldn't know him. Try me. Well, it was before your time. When did you do your last job? Nine years ago. Nine years?! You haven't been on a job in nine years? - That's right. Do you know what's happened in nine years, old man. They've gone to the moon. That's not my kind of drive. Yeah, but what is? You're a hearse driver! He didn't even bring a gun. Did you? Yeah, it's in my bag. 32? You can't even stop a cat with one of these. Peashooter for a gun, and a dinosaur for a driver. This is gonna be a good trip. - Wait. You'll need the key - Thank you. - Excuse the mess up there. - Sure. Where the hell did they dig him up? Nine years! - Who is it? - Me. - What do you want? - Can I have a word? - Well? - Not in front of the lady. Listen, sonny Jim. You've got a bad mouth. You wanna keep on brushing your own teeth, you gotta keep them covered. You can go right ahead with your comedy routine for the lady there, but from now on... Don't make me your straight man. Okay? Come in. - I have to get my things. - Oh yeah, sure, go ahead. - Thank you. - No trouble. - How long have you been here? - Two weeks. - It's been pretty interesting, huh? - No, it was very dull. - You ever think he'd never show up? - No, I knew he'd come. - You have faith in him then? - It's not that. I know him. He's very determined. He'll kill to get what he wants. You should know that. He's not someone to take lightly. Oh, he won't kill me. Until I get him across the border. Well, he's some other things before he's smart. So I wouldn't count on that. My name's Harry Garmes. My name's Claudie Scherrer. He calls me Claudie. Thank you for drying my things. Otherwise I'd had been traveling in wet knickers. Which I wouldn't bare thinking about. What are you looking so serious about, uncle? It's a great day to be out of prison. Can this thing really travel? I know what it says, but can it do more than a 120. What's this gizmo for, the ejector seat? Keep your hands off, Rickard! Sure, sure, uncle. Don't take it so serious. When you can't see the funny side, you're dead. You might just pass away laughing, if your sense of humor doesn't improve. That's the stuff, uncle. I don't like it when you go silent. It's like the guys they used to bring up out of solitary. They didn't know how to talk anymore. Alright, since you're so eager for the sound of my voice, why don't we talk about the plans at the border. You can tell me, uncle. I'll never talk no matter what they do to you. We cross near Perpignan. Shortly thereafter we'll be picked up by a blue Citroen. He'll keep his right hand turn indicator on all the time. When he cuts it off, we'll take the next turn to the right. That's where you'll be met. Great. Neat, simple, no fuss. That's what it's like to work with the big boys, uncle. Everything's got a lot of polish. After that it's Paris and some easy living. What do you do, uncle? I think I'll go some place where they don't call me "uncle" all the time. - I'll be glad when we get rid of him. - He's alright What makes you say that? He's old. He's passed it. He's not so old. Do you have some change? No. Signora. There. Thank you. You're not telling me you could make it with Garmes? It'd be like lying under a side of beef. You think you're the only one who could do it, don't you? No. But I think I'm the only one who could do it the way you like it. I didn't like it that way before I met you. - What is it? - Cops. - Good morning, senor. - Good morning. - Nice car. - Thank you. - Do you come from faraway - From Vallaposa. Do you have any documentation? - Is something wrong? - No, routine control. - Are you traveling alone? - No, I'm not alone. - How many? - Three. - Damn it, what did he tell him? - I don't know. I'll wait in the John. - What? - Where's Rickard? - He's in the John. - Ask him if he wants a lift. Don't stare. Just ask him nice and sexy. - Are you looking for a ride? - Which way are you going? - North. - Fine. Me too. - Good. Okay? - Okay. - Thanks very much. - Certainly. What model is it? It's a 1957. - Wonderful model. Have a great trip. - Thank you. Goodbye. What happened to your friend, the other man? That was as far as he wanted to go. Out! I don't understand... You understand perfectly, you son of a bitch. You were molesting my niece. I give you a lift, you start taking goddamn liberties. Out! You ought to be ashamed of yourself! And about time. One minute he thought he really had it made. The next minute he was thrown out on the side of the road. There he is now. - Hello there! - Hi! Bye! It's turning into a good trip, huh, uncle? Hey, where are you from anyway? Well, my father was American and my mother was Portuguese. I was born in Chicago. I've never been to Chicago, but I'd like to see some of those places. O'Banions Flower Shop. Valentine's Day Garage. You ever been to any of them? Well, they're probably all gone by now. Yeah, I know. I went to Newark once to find the place where they shot Dutch Schultz, but nobody knew what I was talking about. Hey, you didn't know any of those guys, did you? Dutch or Bugs Moran? What's so funny? What the hell age do you think I am? That was forty ought years ago. Okay, I was just asking. I'd like to have been around in those days. Those guys had something. Style, I guess it was. I think it's only in the movies. I don't think they'd survive today. I don't know Do you remember that thing Dutch Schultz said when he was dying? "A boy has never wished nor dashed a thousand Kim." Nobody ever found out what he meant. "A boy has never wished nor dashed a thousand kin."? - Must have been delirious. - Sure he was. But how many people are gonna be quoting you 40 years from now, uncle? Listen, unless you wanna be quoted about 40 minutes from now... ... you better crawl into your hole. We're only 20km from the French border. Oh, you think that's really necessary? No, I think you should stand on the running board with a Tommy gun and spat. How long have you known him? Four years, a little more. - You were very young? - 18. How did it happen? He can't hear anything back there except the rear Axel. I used to go with his brother. And then when Paul turned up he sent me to him. It was better with Paul. His brother was on heavy stuff. You... happy living like this? We have good times. - Don't you want anything else? - What else do you mean? I mean... the trouble, hiding, prison, being chased... My father was chased by bank managers, and finance companies, and doctors. We got it in the stomach. Shot? No. Duodenal ulcer perforated. He didn't say anything memorable when he died either. He just laid there breathing his breath on my mother till she had to run out of the room and be sick. And when she was out of the room he died. Thank you. They're here. You ever been to the Algarve? - No. Is it nice? - Very. I'll give you my address before you go. You never know, you might be passing through. What about Paul? Sure. Why not? I might even get to like him. Stranger things have happened. How long have you lived there? Nine years. When I quit this business I went there with my wife and son. And I bought a house, and a fishing boat, and tried to blend into the landscape. Didn't work. So I stopped pretending and leased my boat to a real fisherman. Except for the fact that I'm just one of those people who... ... doesn't seem to belong anywhere. Where is your wife? I don't know. Right after our son died, she went to Switzerland to have her breasts lifted. I thought she meant by surgery. She never came back. If you've been out of this business for nine years, what made you decide to come back in? Mainly to see if I could still do it. Not that it's proved much. Nothing much has happened. You were very good back at the cafe. So was he. Kept his head all the time. Okay, Rickard. Get out. - Who' she? - Rickard's wife. Isn't Nick here? Nick Casares? He couldn't make it. - You're due some money, right? - 2,5 American. Here. - Okay if I count it? - Count it on your way out. Get out of here, Garmes. - I'd just like to say goodbye. - Where's Tony Perralta? - You know Tony? - He couldn't make it either. I'll be seeing you, kid. Sure. Been nice knowing you. "A boy has never wished nor dashed a thousand kin.". Okay, let's shake it up. On your way, Garmes. And you two better get inside. Inside, Rickard. Am I alright? Move on! Get your hands up! Dirty bastard sold us out. You did good, uncle. Okay, you and Claudie get in the car. I gotta talk to this guy for a minute. - Okay we are on our travels again. - It's a round trip and back to Portugal. Can I have a drink? You know, when I was little, I used to think that the boogie man couldn't get you. if you kept every bit of yourself covered under the blankets. He could only get you if your foot or something were sticking out. Seems a very reasonable theory to me. It is, believe me. Well, uncle. What do you think? What's eating you? Tell me about it, Rickard. Tell me all about it. It's all about staying alive, uncle. - Why are they trying to kill you? - I don't know. - I thought I was being sprung for a job. - So who crossed you? I don't know. Someone who had it in for me, I suppose. The same guys who sprung you, the same guys who hired me to deliver you? I suppose so. Maybe different guys. Maybe it was me. Maybe I masterminded it! Look, uncle. Don't get all excited. What were you inside for? That had nothing to do with it. With what? What did it have nothing to do with? With this. With why they got me out. They got you out to kill you, Rickard. That's why they got you out. What I wanna know is why they wanna kill you. Well, that's my business. No, it's my business now. Because when they come looking for you I go down too. That makes it my business. Why don't you forget about that thing. That's not gonna answer any questions tonight. - You think I wouldn't shoot you? - Sure you would. But not here, not in Spain. Not now. Not with all the Guardan hard guns out there bumping into each other. Now you tell me the story, or you are on your own. Unless I hear it all, I take my chances my way. You think you're the only man in the world who can drive. What do I need you for? We need him. Why? You can... you can rent a car. Or I could steal one. He lives in Albufeira. Do you know where that is? Sure, down south. He's got a boat. How do you know? He told me. He could get us to north Africa. - Are you sure he's got a boat? - I'm sure. You have to tell him everything. His stomach will drop down into his pants if he finds out what he's gotten himself into. He'll run out on us as soon as he knows the score. No he won't. What makes you so sure? Because we're the only family he's got. Yeah. You're right. Go on, get him. - Who is it? - It's me. What? - He wants to talk to you. - Tell him to come over here. - He's frightened. - Is he? I wouldn't have thought he was that smart. Alright. I'll get him. Okay. I guess we'll have the party in your room. Alright. Let's have it, Rickard. And if you hold back, or if I even think you're holding something back, that's it. We split up, okay. Okay. From the top. About 4 years ago I did a job. A big job. You'll remember it. I haven't kept in touch with what's going on. You'll remember this one. Three men tried to kill another man. A man in a big black car with motorcycles in the front and back. It didn't come off. We broke up and went into hiding. I came to Spain and started running stuff. Anyway, I got picked up here. Got 5 years. That was about nine months ago. About three weeks back I got word they were taking me out. - Who was taking you out? - Same people I worked for before. As far as I knew they were setting up the same hit. Wanted no mistakes this time. So they hired me because I know from nothing about anything, huh? Looks like it. Okay... And the people who were waiting. Who were they? Call them what you want, uncle. They're the enemy. It's not the kind of information I'm interested in. Now who were they? What were they doing there? Where were the people who were supposed to be there? I never saw any of those guys before. But they can only be on one team. They must've gotten wind of the hit and moved in. Well, how did you spot them? When they said Tony Perralta couldn't come. I knew that he got killed 3 years ago in the Bronx by a cop. I was with him when it happened. Okay, so they took care of your people. But who pays their bill? Are they big? I wouldn't wanna fall that high. I'm telling you, this is the big boys, uncle How can you get so cheerful about this, Rickard? We're ahead of the game. We run from them. No way, if these guys got the pull you say. There's no way. You gotta run toward them. - We go to the coast. We get a boat. - No way. It might help if we ditched that car of yours, it's not exactly inconspicuous. If anything gets ditched it's more likely to be you and not the car. Well, you're not doing anybody any favors, hop-along. You're gonna need somebody to cover your back for quite some time. Well, you won't be too high on the list. This is stupid! It is stupid to bait(?) each other! Just make up your minds and behave! - Well, what do you think? - I don't know. Depends upon whether you want to be hunted on your own or in a group. I suppose it does. Come on, let's go to bed. I haven't been to sleep in two days. I know, but there's some things I gotta get straight. Tomorrow, it'll be easier tomorrow. - Who is it? - It's Claudie. - Where's Rickard? - Asleep. - He know you're here? - No. Come on. You're not comfortable, get into bed. What's wrong? At this moment absolutely nothing. You're wondering how you got into all this? No, I know how I got into it all. Do you wish you were out? I've been out a long time already. There's all sorts of death, believe me. What people call "death" is just a funeral. Mostly it's been going on for a long time. Yeah, I could've driven off and left you in that place. Maybe lived a little longer. But what would I have bought with the time? A chance to play being a fisherman, who actually never goes fishing? Or, a man pretending to be with a woman when he's actually with a whore? Over there Rickard said: "No matter what you call them they're the enemy." It's not so. That's the enemy, kiddo. You could do so much, and I've wasted about all I have of it in me. Only one thing... Do me no favors. No... - I never do favors. - Good... That's good. Good girl. Any sign of them? - What is it? - The Jaguar behind. It's can't be that Jag. Maybe not. Wasn't that the car that passed us before? Tell us what's happening. I think there's two of them. Or none. There's only one way to find out. Put that gun away! Why don't I just knock it off anyway. Save wondering. You must be some kinda lunatic ! Okay, what now? Now we see whether he runs faster from behind than in front. Nah, he's sticking. Now we'll find out. You can't outrun a Jag in this. The horse is okay. Let's what the jockey's like! They're still with us. Yeah, but we're beginning to make them nervous. Come on, hotshot. You're guessing now. Did I lose them? I don't know about him, but you nearly lost me. Are you okay? They're still coming. He's not there. You did it, uncle. You shook him loose, you old buzzard. Go on, kiss him. It's better than me doing it. What? Something's wrong? Afraid so. You hear that knocking? I don't hear anything. It's using the supercharger too much. Something's gone. Does that mean we're going to have to stop? Grab it a little. Not too much. Just keep the REV cutter above 15. That's better. - There's a car coming! - What make?! - I can't make it out! - Well, it's you're pitch! That's it, it's the third piston. Now rub it now, very gently. What's the score? Well, it could be worse. She's dropped a piston. Sounds like the compression rings are gone. It'll break up. How quickly depends on how hard she's pushed. I could nurse it out to Albufeira with a little luck. Well, let's get going. It's them! You really are something else. What are you doing? I like him that way. I like the way he was lying. He's trying to make it look like an accident. Collecting souvenirs, uncle? Get to the car right away. Get her started. Hey, that was fun. You really know this road? I know where it leads. I know how it's made. I might even have traveled it a long time ago. What is it the French call that, when you think you've been there before? She got a record? Claudie? No why? You love her? Hey. What is this, uncle? If she stays with you she's gonna be in an awful lot of trouble With you it'd be a bed of roses? Can't you think of a single place you'd be safe? Don't start worrying about me, I couldn't take it. No, not you. Her. If she'd go with me would you try to stop her? She can do what she wants. I'd never stop any chick from leaving. "Deja vu", it's called. Can't we get a move on? The piston will break up quicker, I don't want it coming through the block. What are you gonna do about your car when you get to Africa? When I get settled, I'll send for her. You really are a panic(?), uncle. I never called anything a her in my life. It, a car is an it. With you, Rickard, everything is an it. What are we stopping for? I gotta get some sleep. Just a half an hour to clear my head. - Look, get in the back, I'll drive. - No, I'll sleep over there. - You don't trust me to drive "her"? - Half an hour, no more. So now we sit by the side of the road. What if a cop comes along? - Why don't you climb in the trunk? - Oh, kiss off! I don't trust him. Do you think of me as an it? I still have the feeling he'll turn us in when it comes to it. - What do you think? - It's possible. He asked me about you going away with him. What did you say? I said you could do what you wanted. Maybe it might be a good idea if you sorta let him think it was on. Or in anyway, that it wasn't off. I don't like you sending me to other men. It reminds me of your brother. You should complain. He sent you to me. - Is it time? - Mmm. You asked him something about my going away with you. Why didn't you ask me? I just asked him if he'd try to stop you if you wanted to go with me. When were you gonna ask me? When it was all settled between you two? No, it wouldn't have been like that. What would it have been like? Well, I thought we might go to America. There's lots of places there. Small places where there isn't any trouble. You don't have a criminal record, you'd get back into the States easy. I got a little money saved up. I could sell my house, my boat. We'd do alright. They're gonna get to him sooner or later. If they don't somebody else will. It doesn't have to be like that. Alright. I'll go with you. - Why? - Because you won't think of me as an it. That's right. I won't. Come on, let's get going. We're very close now. I gotta make some arrangements. Wait a minute for me till I get back, okay? Monique? It's me Harry. Almost... Look, I want you to do something for me. In a way... Listen, I want you to go see Miguel for me, and tell him to get the boat ready for a trip. Then I'm coming over later tonight and pick up the money I left with you. Right. We're ready to go. Okay, it'll be over in a minute. "Mad Dog" Kola gonna give it to him in a phone booth. Man, those things are deathtraps. Is my foot outside? - Huh? - It's alright, you're covered. I'm gonna go now. Now, if I'm not back in about... 20 minutes, I think you should make for the fishermen's beach. Just keep going downhill, until you hit the shore. Walk to your left away from the big hotel on the front, till you come to it. You'll see all the boats up on the beach. Miguel will be waiting. He'll ask you if you're looking for a restaurant. You tell him you've heard his mullet can be eaten with very little pain afterwards. He'll take you across. There's no need to pay him. I don't know that I like being left here. It's handy place to rub somebody out. It's not the place I'd choose to cross you. Take the keys to the cars. You mean this is hostage, if you don't come back I get to shoot it? Something like that. He doesn't have a gun. Take this. Thank you. - You alright? - Yes, I'm fine. Okay. I won't go with you. I want you to know that before you go, just in case that's why you're doing all this. Thank you for telling me. I never really thought you would. What was that all about? Just telling him what he wanted to hear. - Are you alright? - I'm just tired. - You got the money? - It's in the bedroom. What's wrong? There he is. - Get down! - Come on! No! They killed Miguel! He's one of them! He's been dead for years. Come on. Come on! Transcribed by messomorf.
