After the eighth divorce, I decided to paint in green... and blend in with nature... so as not to deter the arboreal crustaceans. Just such... just in time for medicine. What are you doing here? Who you are? Where are you from? How did you get here? Where are your parents? Parents! - Ondoloh. - What did you say? Cold. That's just... it's cold. Just do not tell me you came here on foot. Did you fall off the plane? And... hopla! Look, it's slippery here. Are you French? Have you got lost? And you? Do your parents know you're lost? - And you? - What I? - Are you lost? - No, I'm not lost. - How is this possible? - What? That somehow you do not hear cars? I thought that they are so poisonous everywhere that you can not breathe. What happened? Today is a day of walking on foot? This is not Central Park in New York? Take care, go down. Hold on tight and do not look down. - That's right... are not you scared? - And you? You could not say "And you?" When I ask you something? - Why? - Because. - You are sick? - Why? You are so green. Is everything green here? No... they are not green. Where does this dragonfly come from? - Is this your daughter? - Of course not. Did you see how she climbed there? - No. - For sure? I did not move all day. I smoked a cigarette. That's why I can not find out what she was doing there. What are you doing inside the jungle? - Are you, are not you French? - And you? - You're probably hungry? - And you... yes. I think it's better for you. At least you're clean. Do you live here? You live alone? Probably because no one wants to live with you here. Who is this? Me and my grandma. It's you? You have not changed much. Thank you. What is this? You better tell where you last saw your parents? What he is doing? Do you eat it? Listen... I really like to joke. And make jokes, but without someone else's help. But it is too late. Enough of this. Tell me, where are your parents? Who they are? And what are you doing here? And then we'll joke. - What? - Oh my God. Okay, I'm kidding. But I've already said three times. You did not tell me anything! I came on a trip to Nowy Jurek in the USA. And I hope others in this city are not as nervous as you are. - I'm not nervous at all! - I regret that I came here. And what do you have to regret? We are not in New York. We're in the worst hole between Patagonia and Canada. You got it? - Far from here to New York? - Quite far. Unfortunately, this means that they pushed me off the course. What? They pushed you off course? Who are they? Stop talking to me with puzzles. Because, first of all... And be kind to me. Because, first of all, I'm tired. Tired! Well... let's agree something. - Do you see any children here? - No. - And you know why? - No. - Because I do not have them. - Yeah. And because I do not have my own, it's not... you will endure other people's sexes. - Good evening Sir. - Goodnight, I think. Before pouring water, season the mussels, then heat them. Laughable! You must have them first. Colonel Villeneuve, Secret Service. Margot Bouvier. The instructions from the ministry just came. We must keep the entire secret. The Americans would like to put a paw on it... after all, you know them. And how! This oceanographic ship will be a good cover for us. They have already decrypted this message. I turned to Professor Andre. He checked all known types of writing. Contemporary and ancient. This is in Sumerian. Colonel, this is the oldest example of writing in the world. Probably so. 4,000 years before the birth of Christ! Their landing point is 62 degrees 32 minutes west... and 5 degrees 45 minutes north latitude. 17th time of universal time. Hell... it's in the middle of the jungle! In the Kanaymaski National Park. I hate flies. Miss Bouvier, I am introducing you to Major Benard... from our special services. I'm Benard... Jeff Benard. Special services... what for? - It's a secret operation. - We are safe. Or maybe invaders who want to destroy us? And what do you want to do? To burn the whole jungle with napalm? This is a protected area. Very backward and cruel Indian tribes live there. Contacts between them and the rest of society are limited. In principle, we have no right to stick our nose there. I got a plane at the airport in Kunabero. Jump out on parachutes. Good luck. I have to take this little Barbie doll? Come on, Benard. What is this fly pack? To the bag, my little ones. Daddy needs money. Go ahead, say something. Try. I will not get angry. You must have something to say. Are you sure you do not want to say anything? Come on, try. Put your lips up like me. He can not talk? Do you speak French? Your puppy is not talking? What's your name? Lolo, Lala, Lily, Lulu... I think Lulu will be good. Put it on. Let's go. What should I wear? On yourself... head to the big hole, and hands to small. - Is this a gift? - Yes, it's a gift. Can I change to something else? More suitable? No, you can not. I am in a hurry and a long way ahead of us. We'll talk another time. - What other time? - Go ahead, we have to move... No I can not. You can... give your hand and jump. You will come with me. I will not jump! I can not! There is nothing to insist. As I said that we are moving, we are moving. Do not come back! What is this clownfish? She's starting to piss me off. You're right, there's no hurry. No, wait! Come back... I'll show you something funny. What's so funny you want to show me? Terrible talks to you. If you do not go down soon... What if I go down? Well, no... I'm not a babysitter. What do you want, puppies? Get out, I'm sick of it. What the hell is that! Have you changed? - Watch this girl! - Good good. Listen to me! I'm interested in sex rarely! And I hate dyed blondes. Turn away! 62 degrees 32 minutes long... 5 degrees 45 minutes north latitude. It's here! We jump. No, in the thick forest lurk, we can not jump! It's there... on the river! You can not rise higher! It will not succeed! - Do you know who you are? - I'm here, I'm Major Benard. You are zero! You are sore at the slightest difficulty! Step back, I'm jumping! Okay... wind in the back! And we are coming back. Genoese cake. Pour water... and beat until uniform. Pour into a greased form. No, no, no admission. National Park! - Hey, asshole... are you sitting here? - Asshole! A good parrot. Remember, boys... I want you back alive! Yes, sir! Be careful. I do not know what it looks like. Attention... just a moment! Carefully! - Is the doctor? - Yes. Good day. - Until next month. - Until the 22nd. Very good picture. A thousand dollars? We have arranged for two. The rest when there is a passport. A glass of Morito. SEARCH BY POLICE AND RELIEVES This child does not look sought after. What can not be said about me. To hell with you! I do not want to wait here! The only way is through the river... and this bridge. It's a National Park... a total ban on admission. - I told you. - Where's your major? He went with the paratroopers. It is a very difficult trip. There is no place for a woman there. What! Did you send this savage without any scientific support? We decided to do it without a lady. Thank you so much. I will turn to the French Navy. And the Navy, like you, says, "Go to hell." - Taxi! On the phone? - Yes, ma'am, let's go! To the Kanaymaska ??Primeval Forest! The Cannabis Forest? Thank you... Please, shut the door. Ship! As always... Come back, I'm begging you! Please, come back! American dollars! Wait a minute, I turn back! - Slowly... - Thank you. That these women always succeed in everything! Thank you very much. Me too. Souvenirs to buy. Thank you, old... as for the souvenirs, I already have everything I need. I'm sorry, please let me through. - Do you speak French? - Yes. - It's amazing! - Incredible? Oh, sorry! - Did it hurt? - A little bit. You fell from heaven. I think you could help me. - Do you know this area well? - I've never been here before. Never? But you can help me anyway. Look... I want to get here. Listen to me. I do not want to be arrogant or even rude... but I can not help you in anything. Detriment. My vacation is over. I swim a bit longer and return to Paris. - He went to you? - What? - Vacation. - I will never forget him. If so... Why did he change course? No, he can not. Please tell the captain. What's happening here? I do not understand it. After all, these people are in a hurry to work. Excuse me. Excuse me. What happened? Course... I'm in a hurry. Straight! Captain, please... faster. Yes Yes. Senor... sorry! I... Kanaymas! - Yes. - Yes? - Kanaymas? - Kanaymas. Excuse me... I'm sorry, I have a problem. I lost my purse somewhere. No Trespassing. But why? Look! He went after all? Hey, you there! Stop! Sir, please! Sir, please! I'm looking for you everywhere! I just wanted to ask something. And then we are surprised that others have a bad opinion about the French. I must ask you only one question. Do you know the way to the Kanaymaska ??Primeval Forest? What are you looking for there? I want to investigate the origin of its inhabitants. It's a long story and I do not want to bore you. You have already succeeded. So where is this direction? My father was an ethnologist. He spent his whole life in distant corners. I do not remember much of it. Just a shadow that once came to kiss me in the evening... when I almost slept and left the smell of earth on my cheek. And then he immediately went to some wild land. And once in the mountains, Papuans caught him in a trap. There have never been Papuan. Then they were! Papuasi Zhivaro. I do not know myself, anyway. Do not let me catch you for words. You do not see a broken woman standing in front of him? I need to get there, that's all. Well... is not you looking for your daughter? The girls? The girls? What do you have... Shhh. Your leg will not stand on my boat anymore. What did you start talking to me? About this little girl? I did not tell you anything. No, you said. About a girl. Remember that. Whar are you doing sir? - Bus stop. - For what? For dinner and sleeping. No, no... I do not want to eat or sleep. You better think about it. We must go further. I do not know what to say. Show me your heart a little. If you change your mind, I'll leave you some goulash for breakfast. Well... are you to tell the truth? But it only has to stay between us. Honestly, I would prefer that there was nothing between us. Well, I will say how it is. Something supernatural has happened to us. U.S? Well... excuse me, I did not introduce myself. I'm Dr. Bouvier, Margot Bouvier. Head of the Astronomical Radio Observatory... in Nancy, France. Yes, yes... we are constantly listening to the universe. I thought you were looking for your father. Do not change the subject. I can not say what I am looking for. I have no right. Even if I said you would not believe it. But I can say that we are on the verge of discovery. The greatest discovery of all time. Deserving to sacrifice supper for him. I never leave the supper. Hell, you think only about yourself. Yes, and believe me, it's always interesting to me. I do not have a family, friend or children. I waited for this moment from birth. You can not screw it with me... just because you are so vain! 1989 - a good year. It is impossible! Well, great! If you are... then I will go alone. I warn you, if something happens to me, it will be your fault. What a bastard... Oh, what a great beast! Look! I'll look tomorrow morning. I have got some idea. I think you'll like it. I will sleep with you, and then we will go straight off. Everyone will give pleasure to another. - Do you want to? - No thanks. Sure, let me... with you... You do not have a piece of cotton cloth? She will drive me crazy. Probably maybe all night. Where do they come from? Let it... bastard! In the end, what I was waiting for! Have you had so long? You lost your passport. Edouard Alphonse Shuazol. You look much worse without a beard. That's too much. I do not dig in your things. Here you are. I have nothing to hide. Are you a dentist? It's good to have a dentist at hand. Are you checking the possibilities of opening the Cabinet here? - I'm not a dentist. - No? Who are you? I'm exhausted. They are viviparous, although people always take them as amphibians. But in reality it is lemurs and this is the difference. Shhh! - Do not touch me. - Will you close at last? Who they are? - Who they are? - Kanaymasi. They are very touchy. They will not eat us. These are not the times. So what, I do not know how to circumnavigate them. If you do not know something, ask. I always travel alone. And I love it when nobody turns my head back. Electronics. My father always used to say... Your father is really starting to piss me off. So gas to the top. We also have the right to go there. Yes, if we get there, which I doubt very much. I have a constructive nature and a scientific mind. Satellite dish is not lying. - All this time, only this constructiveness... - Map, here you have a map. Unfortunately. This is the easiest way to go. Well, we can avoid it. Greetings to your alarm clock. Listen, Dud, be more flexible. Look at the right side of the waterfall. Let me do it my way. And please do not call me Dud. So how should I turn to you? It's best at all. You probably do not believe in aliens from space. But it's very likely... I say it's likely... are you listening to me? And if there are other forms of life in space... just count. Please,... there are 200 billion stars in our galaxy. Their lack is mathematically impossible. You can not deny it. First of all: I lost my way and lost a box of wine through you. Secondly, the cosmos does not care. And thirdly: I lost my way, but I remember her. Do you know them? Do you live here? Give me a list of written questions. I will send you your answer. And now silence. This is here! It's here! Thirteen meters! Here! 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13. Here! Bride! That was exactly here? 62 degrees and 32 minutes, west. Is it here? You rule here? Tell me what you saw. Something has fallen. Space... space ship. A spaceship... lands. Where is he? Departed? No? A planet... a planet. Heaven... ship. Uuuu... uuuu... boom. It's a nightmare. Please, try. You must have seen something. Yes? He is here? Moon. So what? It fell from the moon. She saw something? Is this your daughter? - Gift? - Gift. - Edouard, can I kiss you? - For what? - How do you know my name is Edouard? - I know everything. You found a woman who will live with you. Help me. I told you? Do you like a little girl like that? Tell me, why are you here? To explain it to you. To explain... what? Like me... from there. - Who brought you here? - No, I escaped. - Why? - In fact, by the pill. How is it through the pill? Where did you run from? You call her... just Beta Centauri. - Beta, Beta, what? - Centauri. Do you know what it is? Sure... it's a star. It's our sun. What are you talking about? Where did you get it from? Just look at yourself. You're a girl, not a UFO. Beta Centauri is a star in the constellation of the Virgin... 10 light years. One thousand billion kilometers! What are you talking about? 1253000000000364000000 625000903 kilometers. Are you an astronomer? Yes or no? But... you know where it came from. After all, it is Sumerian cuneiform writing. What did you write here? That's my name. But if you tell me Lulu, it will be very nice to me. Lulu? Are you disappointed? You did not imagine us so much? - What "us"? - Us... strangers. What is this? What did you write here? Is the name of your planet? No, that's our story. Our planet is so small that only children can live on it. Children who never grow up. But, just like you, we can speak and write and we know a lot. Maybe even a little more than you. It is true that we do not have enough time to learn everything. So we learn that the universe is infinite... what is love and that can still be suffering... and death, which is when there is no longer anything. So everyone is taking pills there so that they do not grow old and die. Some things can not be understood in this way. That's why I wanted to understand what love means... and death. And generally everything. But when they chased me, I left the course. And so I finally found myself in this village. And who are they "them"? And if you are not real children, and you do not die... - So how old are you? - Unfortunately... you have to divide your life into many episodes... to find out how much was left. And how do you feel without these pills? How will you not take them what will happen? Maybe I will die. But when the moon is round again, they will take me back. What happened? Are you crying? Are you kidding? The rain begins to rain. And now you need to sleep. As a girl, I was waiting for this moment. I really... I still dreamed about it. And at the same time I was unable to believe it. Living in another solar system that contacts us. Something that never happens. A dream about the impossible. Do you think that this is the greatest achievement of my whole life? Yes. They have always been strangers... like strangers, predators, blue, yellow, greens. The worst is always the easiest to imagine. Yes... but the worst does not have to be you. It's true that we spend our whole life... on sleeping, eating, fear of others. When we talk, we say "thank you" or "good morning"... we perceive each other as in the mirror. Good day. No, the truth is that we squander our whole lives. We throw them out the window, trying to give it a specific direction. And then it still fails. Our life is only its duration, and that's it. We fill them in so badly. Unfortunately! You know what? We have to give ourselves time to fill this whole damn life... when we have fallen into our hands. Do you think who you touch? With this attitude to women! I forbid you to undress me. Even at a distance. I'm not going to undress you! Where does this idea come from? Even if I was undressed, you would still be terrible. You must match me on such a day! What do you imagine? That I will stretch you on the dresser? I have not fallen so low. Me and dresser, good ones. - Should I tell you the secret? - Yes. Personally, I cut off my entire genitals. Do you know why? Never to have affairs with women like you. And you, with your stupidity, crooked legs and a snubbed nose... you certainly will not change this decision. So you are... impotent. That explains a lot. Anyway, I'm not an expert on self-righteous women. Especially on a Friday evening. Is it all you have to say to me? Do not you want to add anything about my feet or hips? No, because I would have to repeat myself. Who are you? I have three similar sticks. And it's still for the locomotive. For the locomotive... what is this? - Locomotive... feel-sensitive-feeling. - Feelings - tenderness - tenderness. It's mine, mine. - Hello, Bouvier? - Jeff? Jeff... you'll break with laughter. - I'm not laughing. - I will call back. You make the task difficult for us. I will put you to justice! What court? I gave you a free hand. I'm not disturbing you. I found it! I can do nothing. Do you think it's easy? It's a girl! Hello, Benard... can you hear me? A girl like you and me. But you ran away... where are you? We've been looking for you for three days! - Where are you? - 63 degrees 32 minutes west. No, it's not like that... we do not know where we are... how we are... Stop yelling at me! I'll call you when you calm down! - You know, the train goes very fast. - Tell me, Lulu... Did not you say you'd like to see New York? And if I wanted to? We will go. We will go there together. You need to get to know you well. You must tell them everything yourself. No, I have to wait for the full moon. I have to wait for them here. There is also a moon in America. You'll like the Empire State Building. We're going up to the top. I'll show you anything you want. No I can not! I can not. Wait, I forgot how to go. Here or there? No, more right! No, not there! Watch out! Edouard, help! I can not breathe! Free me! I can not... I have no right to touch you. You have, you have. You see that I can die. Oh no, a lot of life in front of you. You are invincible. You're lucky to be in a good mood today. My knees dug in. Only no injections. I have an allergy at all. I warned you. What are you doing? It hurts me lower. You never know with your knees. They may hurt higher. You do not give me an injection? You heard what I was saying. Too late! I will be very sick because of you! You never listen to what is being said to you? Now very rarely... I became a free man. And what are you doing with your freedom? That's what I can. After all, you were not always a savage. You had a family, you were a dentist. You had your life. I lived a dentist's life, I had problems with the dentist and the dentist's family. Most dentists jump out of the window of their office. I jumped on the bus. - What bus? - Line 32. From the East Railway Station to the Saint-Cloud Gate. And on this bus... I've decided to never look in the eyes of a woman again. All the trouble starts like this... from a woman's look. And... that's why I landed here. Because of green eyes... emerald green. From the moment she sat down in front of the damn bus... I knew everything was lost! - I thought you'd sworn. - Yeah... but she did not have to look at me like that! I immediately felt that for such a look... - I would drive to the end of the world. - Where did you go? To Mexico, Madrid, London, Buenos Aires. She was a dancer, she was taping in the band. We even spoke in different languages. We did not talk to each other. That's why I stayed for 6 months. In the end, she noticed me... I even learned to tap. But in the meantime, she found another... seller from Caracas. That was the first time I looked her in the eye and said "he or I". And what? - She replied "he". - Oh! Do you know the Ayacucho region? There is a mine famous for its purest emeralds. And the most soulless police in all of Central America. THEFT OF THE EMERGENCY IN THE MINE - You mean that... - Yes, that's what I'm saying. You have the stupidest emerald thief in the northern hemisphere... wanted in four countries. The Slovene has given me such horns... which I met at the Saint Augustin station in the 8th arrondissement in Paris. But these emeralds had to somehow influence her. You know, I did not have time to surprise her. However, they could have made a certain impression on her. Let me tell you something... my misfortune lies in this... that I still try to make women happy. And that... you said earlier that you had learned to tap, so... Well, it must have caused some reaction from your dancer. Yes... laughter. And you really removed it all? - What? - Well, genitalia. - Completely. - So everything... But if all men would be castoring themselves...? You think so? You tired me. I'm tired. I would like to stay alone now. What's going on? Kanaymasi, a local variant of terrorism. I do not like girls eavesdropping at the door. Do not close the door. Edouard... so good? Yes very good. But now is not the time. Take your rifles and all your weapons. Edouard! Close the gate. Disintegration begins. Come here, fast! - What are genitals? - Do not you have other worries? Go on... What is this? Did you eat anything? Nothing, I'm hungry at all. I do not go in, I've already been there. Lulu! I'm telling you... Lulu! Come back, it's dangerous! I will go where I want. I never had a father and I do not need him. Come, I'll fill you in. - Do I have to climb a tree in front of everyone? - Come on, there's a ladder. You know, you're doing pretty well, but you're a stupid fool. Do you want to give me pleasure? Forget everything I said. Who says I want to please you? Attack! Alright... it's over. Why is it so cold? Why does not he want to look at me? You would not want to know that. But it's not like that... it's not just a piece of meat. Where is it, who he was, what he knew, where was his smile? And what are the drops of water flowing from my eyes? Where will he go? The river will take it to the sea. And it will come back in the form of rain. Let's go, we will not sleep in a settlement where someone died. They say it attracts misfortune. It's all weird, I've imagined it differently. What? When you have a father and mother. Maybe I made a mistake and landed badly. I think we are good three of us. And there, with you, how do you live? Look... her hair is graying. Maybe it is not necessary for people to die? Sleep... and do not worry. We are here. Coming here was a form of escape? Of course. You hid here... for fear of looking at the woman from the bus. If now the bus of line 32 comes up, it will be my end. Lulu, do not go far, there's electricity. Well, it's cool and nice here. Beautiful women and buses, they forgot about me this time. What do you want? Edouard! No no! Edouard, help! Let her go! Take the girl and the boat! Edouard, help! Only not Lulu, you can not! Edouard! They kidnapped Lulu! Help! They've been kidding Lulu! Do something! Okay, consent... I was stupid. And it does not happen to you? What do you expect from me? An apology? I'm too nervous for that. Will you peel so long? What do you want to do... carve a pear? Eat this and let's move! - Where are we going to go? - Listen to me! I am asking you for a great favor. I understand that this requires a lot of sacrifice from you. At least once, could not you go without a dessert? Let's go! I understand, you know where to go. You know every meter of this damned jungle! It's this tablet... if it does not take it, it may die. Time lapse at superluminal speed. For her, one hour... it's like 10 years for us. We can not let her die. I beg you. Full moon! Six days, in six days. They'll come in six days. - What are they? - When the moon is round. You must... promise me something. Of course, whatever you want. If we can save her, promise me, promise... that after all this you will leave forever. - Of course, without a word. - No, better than you say. - Well, so I will say. - Then tell me. - Okay, I promise. - And that's it. - What are you doing here? - Feelings. He is constantly bored with his sense of smell. How old do you think, how old is this girl? Taking into account the urea index, more than one hundred. The composition of her hair is amazing. One could say that it is the mummy of Ramses II. Can it be more than 3,000 years old? What is this? Shit, what's this equipment! I told you to check the electrodes. It is your fault! Leave it! The child disconnected them, that's all. And what a mess it is! Benard, she did not fly away from here. - Search the whole ship. - Yes, sir. Benard! Hell, Benard, where is she? Taxi! They're still here. Let's go. We'll explain to them that the helicopter... he can bring the girl back in less than an hour. I'll fire a bazooka to make them easier to understand. Otherwise, it will take more than an hour to convince them. No, come with me and do not interfere. I will be a bit behind. I do not want to upset them. You will certainly get along with them. Idiots, you do not understand anything! The child must return to the landing site. This is beyond discussion! I'll take her wherever you want as soon as I find her. It hurts! And what, how do you find her? What have you done to her? Fled. We'll talk along the way. Where?! You'll take me to her. You're a girl too and you know better... I am very sorry, ladies and gentlemen! I do not want to interfere in your private affairs. - Some moron! - I'm a tourist. These walks... this fantastic atmosphere! Do not you look for a girl with pigtails? No? And I just saw her go there. - Check it. - Great, sir! I love, I love helping others. Especially during holidays. We're running away! My scooter! - Quickly, behind them! - This is! My taxi! My taxi! WANTED It's a police station! Stop! We must ask them for help. She is in danger. - We have no choice. - What are you talking about? As soon as I blink to the cops, they'll let me go in 20 years. You only think about yourself! No, it's getting annoying. I have an idea! Phone... wait, I'll give you a number. Remember.... 633333333. What is this number? This is Colonel Villeneuve's secret base In case of trouble, he'll get you out of jail. Now, hide and I will go there. It's a matter of life or death. A little girl... with pigtails. An extraordinary girl. She came from the moon! Like in Spanish... moon, star, top down. Wait, the girl... escaped from those who are flying... you have to find her. Do not you understand that she is in danger? They do not understand anything. Complete savages. How will it be in Spanish "full moon" and "alien"? - What? - Take this whore! Still this one! Chu-feel. Lulu! Lulu! Margot, I was supposed to leave this country. Now the police have tracked me, and you do not give me peace. Just thank you! They have something else to do than just chase you. It's some persecutory mania, poor friend. I'm not your poor friend. Enough of this! Donkeys. Hey, I'm late! I'm a woman! Excuse me. Hurry! - Wake up... do something! - Okay, but what? We must disconnect the rest of the train. It should not be difficult. Oh, here. - Pull out this metal piece. - What? Do not twist. I will do it. - Shit! - Make a dam at point K. Idiots! Quick, for this stroller! - Faster, faster! - It's up to resistance, sir! He slows down, he noticed us! Come on, do something! What is? Yes, faster! Hurry up! Will you shut up for a moment or not? Faster, daddy! What is... you swallowed a fly? Alright, good! Stop! Stop! Hurry! Hurry! And you come here! - Can not go faster? - He says he can not do it faster. What will we do? Where are we? Want to know where we are? - Yes i want to know. - In deep shit, we're there. Shoot them! Shoot, be a man once! - Bravo! - Strangely flew, it shakes a little. Of course he shakes. Give me that! We are not at the shooting range! - Shit, you can not! - What do they have to us? You see, the two of us go much better. What a scrap of scrap! Where is the train going? Where's Lulu? They're there! I will help you, no time. Wait... I'll do it. It was not so difficult. You got it. Ride. Let's hide! Forwards, faster. Brake. Postponed right. - Good job, boys. - Thank you, Major. Look. We better hurry. Why did I get into this dung. I was so good in the jungle. Probably so. But there you can fool. Look! For you it's the end of the road. Get out! - Have you seen...? - What? The bus is number 32. Is that a miracle? Tell you a secret? First time I go by bus number 32. How is it? I like to tell stories. It amuses me. Is it fun? But... is that your dancer, tap dancing and green eyes like emeralds? These are just my fantasies. Her eyes were even more beautiful. And seriously... you've heard about a Slovenian dancer... tapering at Caracas? And I believed you. You have failed my trust. What's happening? Where are you going! St. Cloud! The final stop! There, there! Lulu, come to me. Let's rest an hour. Maybe he could be my beloved. I do not even remember his name. Loving someone is always so sad? Not always, but often. Why do you say that? What do you know about it? I do not want to come back to him. I would like to live here a little longer. Only a little bit. Do not cry, honey. - Seconds run like crazy. - They're telling you, it's time to go home. If you never know the taste of life... it will seem surprisingly short. It is difficult to get to know this girl who fell with us in the rain We are transparent to her. You can not fool it. She woke up in me the desire to have 34 children. Look... look up. I kept them with the thought... that one day they will be a good gift for goodbye. What about the rest? No, I've already said goodbye to you. You know, you will not wear them all at your age. It's enough for three women a day. Do you know what I will tell you? Another woman who will demand that I make her 34 children... I will simply bind and throw it on Orinoco. - I did not ask you for anything. - Oh... you made me understand. - I think you understand. - Blah blah blah. - Do not play with me. - I spoke about children as a category. - I'm not a category. - I understood something. I also have a soul and I can not understand. I've never imagined... - To leave me... - I've never seen... with a wreath of 34 children... Hey, it's all right. They want to take you to the exam. - What exam? - For parents. So, are we going or not? - Where? - To Central Park. - Let's go. - Hurray !!!
