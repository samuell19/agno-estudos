Looking back at my life, thinking back to the times when Mike, wanting a family, to be his wife, times was good. When Mike was trying. - Babe, you love me? Do you? - Come on. - Now you love me. Come on, you gonna tell me you love me? - You should know that though like, really? - Then why you don't tell me? - My actions don't show that? What you talking about? - Maybe I want you to tell me. - I tell you all the time, man. Aye yo, I left the guards in the car. Go to the car and grab them Swishers for me. - Really? - Just go grab the Swishers, man. - I make smoke- - I'm out. - You gotta make something outta of something every time. - Get the key. (car starts) - [Woman On Phone] You got stuff to do? I'm sure. - I told you. I'm gonna come through later. I'm with her now, I'm-a come through later. I gotta get my hair on something, I don't know. - [Mike] Get that shit off. Yeah. Hey she coming back, let me call you back. - Who you on the phone with? - Huh? - Who are you on the phone with? - What you talkin' 'bout? - What you mean what I'm talkin' 'bout? Your phone's on the Bluetooth. Who you on the phone with? - I see we ain't got privacy no more, huh? - That's how you gonna spin that? - There ain't nothin' to spin, yo. - So you're not gonna tell me who you was on the phone with? - Not doin' this, yo. - You're not doing what? - Trying to have a little cool, little picnic. Yo, yo, yo, don't do that. - Really? - Don't do that. - So you're not gonna answer me? - For what? Yo you, you ruin everything. Man, fuck that. Trying to have a little cool, little picnic. Yo, find your own way home, yo. Like call a Rideshare or some shit. - What? - I'm not doing this with you. Hold that for me. - I'm not holding nothing. - Fuck you. It's just glass. Bullshit, my shit. - Wow. - Find your own way to the crib, I'm not doin' this. - Okay. - You ruin every fuckin' thing. - Hey ma, you look so pretty. - Hey, how are you, baby? - How are you doing? - I'm good. - You want some iced tea? - Sure. - [Lexxy] What's going on? - I really hate to see you upset. Why do you keep putting yourself through this? You entertain a man that you give your power to, your feelings? Love isn't supposed to hurt. Love feels good, real good. Look at you, your eyes all puffy and your hair's a mess and for what? I bet you he gone on about his business this evening, but you know what? I'm not even a bit surprised. - Ma, you're supposed to be consoling me. Not preaching to me. - Oh, I'm not preaching to you. I'm just telling you the holified, sanctified truth. Now do I need to go pay him a visit? - No, you do not need to go pay him a visit. (sighs) You know what? Maybe I'm overreacting. Lately my hormones have been going bananas. You know I'm planning for this pregnancy, ma. - Pregnancy? Lexxy. When are you gonna come to terms? Maybe you can't get pregnant? It's because you're not supposed to be pregnant with his baby. Please stop loving a man that doesn't love you back. You are too beautiful to sacrifice your happiness and your spirit. Especially for that fool. - Ma, he cannot be that bad. He asked me to marry him. He cannot be that bad, ma. You know what? I came, I wanted you to come over so I can vent to you. But now I have a headache talking about all of this stuff. I just need to lay down, take a nap. I don't wanna think about it. I'll see you later, okay? We could talk about it later. I love you.

You need somebody better than that. And I raise you up better than this, Lexxy. - Ma, I just wanna have a family. - You can have a family, but you can have it with somebody else. I don't like him and I don't trust him. - Come on ma, come on, come on, I'm pursuing my career. I'm doing well. - Right, and that's fine, you can do that Lexxy, but there's better fish out there. I'm just saying. I'm just saying. And I know you don't want to hear it. - [Lexxy] I really don't. - [Ma] Well, you need to! - Ma. - What? - Mike. - Mike? - Shh! - Don't shush me. (Lexxy sighs) Where you going? - [Lexxy] Mike sure knows how to make an apology. And he definitely knows the way to my heart. He never shows up unannounced or empty handed.

It's just that he has a lot of asshole tendencies, but I feel like all guys have asshole tendencies, you know? - True. - But maybe Mike needs a leash. - (laughs) And a muzzle. (tire pops) - Oh my gosh. I know this is not happening to me right now. (Lexxy grunts) Another flat? Not right now. (Lexxy sighs) Gosh. - Girl, we got a flat flat. Let me call Triple A and see if they can come fix my car. Can you change our flight to a later time? - Not today, sunshine. We are screwed. - What? Oh my God Ce Ce, I'm so sorry. The last time I checked my tire pressure when I got my oil changed, my tires was fine. I must have rolled over a pothole or glass or something. This is really blowing mind. Hello? How you doing? Are you guys able to come change my tire? Okay. Do you have an ETA? All right, thanks. Triple A on the way. - Okay, girl you good. Listen, I love chilling with you. Okay? I had a lot to do in town anyway, so. We can catch it next time. - Yes. I needed some girl time, like I've been so stressed and tense. The thought of not being able to have a baby is scaring me. - Listen, Lexxy, you will have a baby when it's your time. Okay? But just do you for right now because when the baby comes, guess what? You got the long nights of cryin' and the diaper changing. - Honestly, I know this might sound weird, but I'm looking forward to that stuff. I already started ordering baby magazines and books. Mike thinks I'm obsessed. - I don't know Lexx. I mean, you do sound a little suspect. (laughs) - Listen, I just wanna be happy, like. My mom is down my back telling me I need to make better decisions for myself. And you know, after college I stopped pursuing my music career to sacrifice for my family. So if that was a mistake, I'm gonna be really, really upset. - Not just a mistake. Okay? This'll be a very bad decision. Let me tell it, all right. You still got time to pursue your career. You're young. You're beautiful. And that booty ain't started sagging yet. (laughs) But I'll support you Lil' Kim. I said, I love you boo, such a boss ass bitch. - I know. - What's takin' Triple A so long? I could have changed this tire myself. - I'm not gonna call my Uber until he gets here. - Uber? I'm taking you home. - Girl, you good. That way you can get on the E-way. Avoid traffic. I mean, you know, see us sitting in rush hour. - You crazy. - Just sayin'. (hip-hop song begins) (doorbell rings) - 'Bout time. Come in. - Nice place you got here for your little princess. She's a lucky girl. But now, the question is, are you ready for a queen? - Yeah.

(upbeat music) (Mike and Angel sighing) (coughs) Damn papi, don't tell me you're a one minute man? - [Mike] Hell no, just a little excited. (upbeat music) Look yo, I don't know what this is. I don't know if this a one time thing, or if you're really gonna rock with daddy or not. - (laughs) Daddy? Really? I ain't plannin' on fuckin' you tonight anyways. I just wanted to taste you, Mr. One Minute. - [Mike] What? I want you. Oh yeah? I can't get no pole? - Mm mm. Matter fact, let me see.

I missed our flight, we couldn't make it to the airport but I have to use the bathroom. Excuse me, baby. Is that Victoria's Secret perfume that I smell? What's going on, Mike? - Hell, you tripping. - I'm tripping? Like really? - Ain't that your shit? - My shit? Really? I haven't wore that perfume since I was in seventh grade.

I ain't pickin' up the phone for you. - How you like that as a female? - I'm fuckin' with it, for real. - You like it? - Yeah. - 'Cause we could have a side nigga if we really wanted to. - That's a fact, it's relatable. - Yeah, I'm tired of being loyal all day. Faithful all day. - Waitin' at home. - Bein' stressed out. Period, period. - Don't got time for that. (Lexxy laughs) Want me to play it back? - Yeah, play it back. - I got you. - [Lexxy] It feels good bein' back doin' what I love to do. I'm focused now, but I can't lie. I do miss Mike. Let me call my girl. (phone buzzes) - Hello? - Hey boo. What you doing? - Girl, nothin'. Just had to fire this girl today. - [Lexxy] What? - She mad at me 'cause she was late four times this week. I told her I'm the only one doing that broken around here. I can't with these new millennials, girl. - [Lexxy] Over it. (laughs) - What's up with you. How you feeling today? - I haven't been sleepin' on my Posturepedic this weekend, you know how I feel about my bed. - You miss him, don't you? - Yeah, I do. I'm not going lie, but I know what I'm up against and honestly, I'll admit, I'm scared. But even if it's not meant to be, I think I should at least see this out. - Well what does Mike think? - Of course he wants me to come back home. He keeps saying he's sorry, soundin' sad, playing victim, but I really don't know if I'm giving in too early or if I'm doing things the right way, but. - It's all how you feel though. - My mom says it should feel right, but I don't know, it doesn't feel right like, he has his good days just as well as he has his bad days like, no man is perfect, so. I don't know what to do. - You a bigger risk taker than me. Whatever decision you make, I love you no matter what. Like honestly, (other line beeping) I just want you to be happy. - Wait, wait, wait, hold on. That's Betty on the other line, okay? - Well, tell Betty to call me 'cause her package delivered. - (laughs) All right, all right, all right. Hello? - Bitch, what you doin'? Now you know you been supposed to come to the gym with me. - (laughs) All right, all right, all right. - Girl. What the fuck? Bitch hold on. Let me call you back. - Yeah, I'm back. Betty tryin' to get somebody in that gym girl. I'm not with it. - You probably need to release some endorphins and go to the gym with her. - I'm not with it. Trust me, she is reinventing herself as we speak. Don't believe me, just watch. I promise. - I believe you girl. Look, I just want you to be happy. - I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. - If Mike makes you happy, then hang. - I know. - That is your home and you shouldn't have to be the one running from it. - Well, I'm gonna write my mom a note and I'm gonna leave. So I'll just call you when I get in tonight. - Okay, don't forget. I love you. - It's a promise. I love you. I love you more. (laughs) Bye boo. So I decided to meet up with Mike and hear him out. Let's see how this goes. Why are you stopping the car? - I just have to pull over man. Tell you some shit. - Tell me what? - Basically, why I move the way I move. Why I do the shit I do. Why you get treated the way you get treated. I didn't have my mama around when I was comin' up, like I don't know how to be romantic and show love and all that shit. All I know is to move and get it. So this shit with women and shit, man, like this shit ain't me like that. It was like, I'd rather invite women in than invite myself out. You know? It's like, y'all wrong. - Stop crying. We gonna get through this together. You hear me? You hear me? This is why you gotta open up and tell me what's going on 'cause I don't understand. You hear me? Stop crying. It's gonna be alright. We gonna get through it, okay? - I love you, yo. - I love you too. We out, just go. (car starts) - Oh what's up babe? I didn't know you was up. You want some coffee or something? - No, thank you, I've been laying off the caffeine lately. - Okay. You sure you good though? - Yes. - Yeah, I was thinking. I made you uncomfortable. We can just wait. Most important thing is not losing you. - No, I thought about it and I love you. So I'm willing to try something new if it's gonna bring us closer together. But I'm picking the girl. - Whatever you say. Hold on. But I can't make no suggestions? - No. Actually, I was looking at her or her. - The first one? She definitely too skinny. The second. - Here you go. - Babe. Are you purposely trying to choose women that you know I wouldn't pick in real life? - What? Why would you say that? You really think I'm insecure, huh? - I ain't saying all that. I'm just sayin', I still want to get it up. - You just wanna pick her. - Here you go. Look. Let me see. What about her? - I mean she's cute, but this is not your type. - That's what make it special. I just sayin' ain't nobody gonna compare to you, baby. I mean, I don't know. Just sayin' none of these gonna cut it. - So you want her? - Nah, we want her. I want you to want her too, babe. - I mean, I'm not gonna lie, I'll give credit when it's due, she's cute. She's sexy, but how don't we even know if she's single? Bisexual? She could be a lesbian. You know that, right? - You thinking too much into this shit. Just slide into her DM's and see what's poppin'. - No. - Matter of fact, I got you. - What? - Come here. - What are you doing? Did you just take a picture? Like really? - Send that to her. - You think that was cool? You are such a creep. - So I'm a creep? You trippin'. Why, I bet she gonna be into it. - You never cease to amaze me. - Um, Alexis? - Yes. - Hey, what's up? - What's up girl. How you doing? - This is Honey. - I know who it is, girl. What's up? How you doing? - Yeah. I'm calling because of our little conversation on the 'gram. - Yeah. About that. You was looking like a little snack on the 'gram, I had to hit you up. So what's up? - Let me find out you're nervous. - Nervous about what, I'm trying to have some fun. My man trying to have some fun. So what's up? What we doing? - (laughs) That's crazy. I'm actually flattered. Anyway, one question though. This your idea or your boyfriend's? - It's my idea. Why would it be my boyfriend's idea? I hit you up, right? I run shit. - Oh, I get it. I get it. - So what's up? What we doing, like. You need to pull up tonight. I got the bottles. We got some good music, some good food. Pull up so we can vibe. I know you ain't got nothing to do. - Well how's eight-ish? - Okay, tonight it is. (laughs) - Okay. Cool. All right. I'll hit you when I get close. Okay.
