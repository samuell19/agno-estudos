Holly? Ooh, not yet. Just going to get you to close those eyes for me. Perfect, yep. Just keep them closed. It'll be so much better for the final reveal. Just trust me. Oh, okay. Well uh, did you want some hot cocoa? Oh yeah, I'd love some. That'd be awesome. Okay, see you in a little bit. - Yeah. - Thank you. Oh. Okay. I got you, I got you. That thing is deceptively heavy. Yeah. And uh, why was it in your living room? Well, everybody keeps their best holiday d√©cor for parties in their living room so it's accessible. I will have to take your word for it. Wow. Holly, it looks beautiful back here. Thank you. Yeah, my client is a really good friend of Eve's so I'm pulling out all of the stops for this party. Promotion still dangling in the balance, huh? Holly, I'm so close. You are the most hardworking, kind and seriously creative party planner. Well, at least in the Greater Denver Area. She would be silly not to give it to you. Well if I do get that lead planner position, then I won't have to beg my best friend to spend her lunch break dragging stuff across town for me. Well at least I won't have to go to the gym later. So win-win. Speaking of gym, how did your date go with super hot trainer Matt? Uh yeah, I, I didn't go. Why not? It's just that I really want to focus on work right now. You can't put your life on hold forever. It's not forever. Eve promised that she would have an answer for me by the end of the year. Well then promise me you will call Matt as soon as Eve tells you that you are the new lead planner. Because those biceps? Too good to waste. Stop it. Okay, you have my word. Oh shoot. Um, I gotta run. Oh, new boss putting you to work? Something like that. See you soon. Okay. Bye, thank you again. Hi Eve. Holly? Great news. You have a new client. Another one? Uh yes, a huge one. Pine Architecture? Oh wait. Pine Architecture. Uh, my friend Blaire works there. I know. She is the one who referred you for the job. When you're all done with Faith I need you to head down there. Do you think you can make it by 3:30? Uh, sure. Yes. That shouldn't be a problem. That is my girl. Swing by the office on your way and pick up the brief. Oh, and there is one condition. You have to work with the owner's son. He wants him involved in the entire process. I think he's interested in getting into events or something, I'm not really sure. But he was very adamant that he was heavily involved in all your work. Yeah, yeah, that's no biggie. I've had weirder client requests before, so. You're crushing it girl. I can't wait to see what you do with this party. Yeah, and... just before you go. Anything about the, you know, the promotion? I pitched you to the board today. Knock this one out of the park and you're a shoe in. Great. That's great. Thank you, Eve. Of course. Go get em, kiddo. I'll see you tomorrow. Okay. Bye. Okay. Blaire, why didn't you tell me? It wasn't confirmed. I was just waiting for it to be official. Oh uh, I gotta take this. See you soon? Oh okay. Okay, I'll see you soon. Bye. Afternoon Patsy. Hi. I would love a peppermint mocha when you get a chance and also any gift suggestions you might have. I'm meeting a new client today. Oh, how exciting. We just got some new handmade ceramics in over on the wall. Would make a great gift. That would be perfect. Thank you. Here. Oh. Thank you. It's my duty to serve the vertically challenged individuals in my community. Oh, well I'm glad you're putting your talents to good use. Thank you. - Oh. - Oh. I think you owe me. Yeah, I think you getting something down off the top shelf and me giving you the last of the best coffee in Denver aren't quite equal. I beg to differ. I really need this to impress a client. And I really need that coffee because it's my favorite. Oh. That's solid reasoning. Okay. Patsy? Do you have another shipment of the Christmas blend coming in anytime soon? Oh sorry. That's the last of it till next Christmas. Okay. Of course it is. Listen, I'm sure that you and my client are totally comparable and equally admirable recipients of this incredibly rare coffee. But how about I play you for it? Rock paper scissors, in the spirit of Christmas. Are you serious? As a snowstorm. Fine. Ooh. - Oh dang. - Yeah. Best out of three? I mean it's only fair. Huh. Aww. That's what I thought. Well, you win fair and square. Don't say I never did anything for you. I wouldn't dream of it. For you, Christmas blend black and for you, peppermint mocha. Thank you. Ooh, bitter. Sweet. Oh, they should've been the other way around. I am so sorry. No worries. I'm still getting used to this online ordering system. Hey, online ordering is the way of the future. All the local shops are doing it. Hmm. Well if the old way works. Gotta innovate to stay relevant. Whatever you say. There. Thank you. Thank you, Patsy. You have a nice day. Charge it on my account. Tall guy. Coffee girl. Uh. Oh, don't worry. She paid for you. Oh. Merry Christmas. Hi, how can I help you? Hi. I am here to see Mr. Pine at 3:30. Ooh. I got it. - Hey. - Hi. This place is so cool. I know. You should come back here and see the models. They are stunning. Okay. So I need to finish setting up for the meeting. Can I get you anything while you wait? Hot cocoa, coffee, tea? I'm okay. Okay, well I'll come back and get you when I'm done. - Take your coat? - Oh, thank you. - Mmm-hmm. - Okay. Hey. Hey, uh, can you... What is that? It's called Christmas spirit. What, you don't like it? Hey. Do you have any recent updates on the design? Because we need to get that over to engineering. When I do you will be the first to know, but in the meantime can you make getting me the design software priority numero uno? Already on it. Thank you. Jingle bells, jingle bells... Blaire. Yes sir? Did the model blueprint get to Theo? On its way now. Great. And everything's all squared away with that party planner? Uh yeah, yeah. She's ready to go. Do you think she'll work well with Theo? Holly Green is the kindest, warmest, hardest working person I know. But she takes no nonsense from no one, so she'll give Theo a run for his money. What bet did you lose? Oh, you didn't know? I'm actually Santa Claus moonlighting as your office manager. Now get back to work. What's this? For the pitch. I said digital. Richard approved it. What am I supposed to do with this? I don't know, build it. Build it? Ready? Uh, yeah. Hi. Afternoon everyone. Shall we begin? As many of you know, we have put in a bid to the mayor to design and build Denver's new city center. This would be Pine Architecture's first commercial contract and it would be instrumental in pushing us into bigger builds. Now this is just a placeholder until we get our design up and running, but you can see what I'm going for. Modern, svelte, the future. The future of Pine Architecture is commercial, and we need to show Mayor Donahue that we are a hub of innovation. What about the Christmas party? What about it? Well the Christmas party's our ace in the hole. Mayor Donahue attends every year and... A Christmas party is not going to sway Mayor Donahue into giving us the contract. I've looked into it and we are by far the least technologically advanced firm. But as I said, we have an advantage over the other guys. Mayor Donahue knows us. His values align with our values, the Christmas party is as much of a priority as is the pitch itself. Which is why I've hired you a party planner. - Coffee girl? - Tall guy? Hi Holly. Mr. Pine, I assume. Nice to meet you. What are you doing here? You two know each other. - Know would be a stretch. - Sort of... Uh, Holly Green with Encore Events. It's nice to officially meet you. Nice to officially meet you, Miss Green. And since you are the son of my client, these are for you. Oh. Charming how that worked out. Best coffee in Denver. So I've heard. Well um, I think that's enough for today. Why don't we get back to work and let Holly and Theo get this party started? Literally. - Good luck. - Thank you. And then there were two. Okay, I'm not entirely sure how this worked out. Your father sent in a form and signed a brief. Oh, so you already have the brief? Yeah, I do. Perfect. Well, just do whatever it says in there and I will be in my office if you need me. Oh, but I... No, uh, I really gotta get back to this. Oh, uh yeah. I think I forgot my coffee. Well that was a quick meeting. She already had the briefs, so... I know you think a flashy pitch is the key to landing this contract, but that's just not the case. You need to show Mayor Donahue why he'd want to work with you. Of course they want to work with us, Dad. Not us, Theo. You. You need to show him that you understand, that your values align with his. The Christmas party's the easiest way to do that. The Christmas party... Let me make myself very clear. You'll work with Holly to plan every aspect of this party, or I'll remove us from the running of the contract. Whoa, that's a little drastic, don't you think? I mean I'm happy to help out if it means that much. It does. Okay then. I'll do it. You mean like right now, like right this very second? Okay then. I will do it. I will get that mistletoe. Holly? Holly? Wait. Oh. Did you finish all of that very important paperwork that you had in there? It would seem that I did. Oh, okay. Good. Wait. I am here to help plan the party. Can't be too hard, right? Just order some fake snow and call it a day, right? Oh. Have you ever planned a Christmas party before? Um, no, but how hard can it be? - Yeah. - Yeah. I think you're right. You should let me handle it. Wait. Uh, this Christmas party is very important to my father, and maybe I haven't planned a Christmas party before per se but I am here to help you with whatever you need. Let me know. So you feel bad about earlier? Honestly, I am just gutted. My sincerest condolences for my unprofessional behavior. Mmm-hmm. Okay wait... I am sorry because I was rude and dismissive and that was wrong. I was wrong. So please accept my apology, because I do want to make this the perfect Christmas party. Okay, but you have to follow my lead. You can't just order fake snow and pick out the first Christmas tree you find. - Got it? - Got it. Okay. I'll be back tomorrow. Start helping out. Why don't you get some comfortable shoes? What's wrong with my shoes? These are comfy. Have a, have a good day. Mom? Dad? We're in here. Dad, is that cookie supposed to be you? Ha. What makes you say that? Hey, how was your event today, sweetie? It was great. And I got a new client. Pine Architecture. Where Blaire works! Yeah. I guess she was the one that got me the job. And Eve said that this one might be the one that pushes me right over the edge, so hopefully the board agrees. That promotion is way overdue. Hear, hear. Thank you. Hello, hello. Sorry, I'm late. Ooh, something smells nice. What did I miss? Well, Dad is making cookie self-portraits for the neighbors. Again? What do you think? Pretty good, huh? It's a spitting image. Breathtaking. Felix, your parents don't have any dietary restrictions, do they? Well, it would explain why they never eat my cooking. But no, they love their gluten and dairy. Good. Because the Green family breakfast for dinner is full of both. Felix: Excellent. Okay. Dad, I notice that now the upstairs hallway also doesn't have a real floor. Yeah. I saw this really cool trick with tiles on the internet last week and thought I'd give it a shot. So I guess the guest bathroom is finally done, huh? No. No, no, no, no, no. Yeah, Dad likes to start a new project before the current one is finished. Aw. I mean, that's not true. I did take down the old curtains before I installed the new ones. True. I don't think that counts, dear. Yeah well. Don't worry, it'll all be done by... Done by Christmas. What, it will! Come on. It will. Uh, Joy? Is there something you want to tell us? What's going on? We were going to tell you later tonight, but... Oh my. Both: We're pregnant. What? Oh my god, this is so exciting. This is amazing. Oh. This is going to be the best Christmas gift ever. Come here. Ooh. So, if it's a girl you're definitely naming it after me, right? You know Dad asked me the same thing. Oh, of course. Gosh. You guys seem really happy. Mmm. How did you know that he was the right one, like, or that it was the right time? Well, I don't know such a thing as the right time exists. But Felix is my best friend. Where I stop, he starts. He compliments me in all the best ways. Are you having second thoughts about ending things with Nate? No. Nate was... great. You know, perfect even. Just not perfect for me. But you know what, I don't even have time to date right now. I just, I'm focused on this promotion. Once I get it, things slow down, then I will consider it. I'll consider it maybe. Maybe. Here. I want you to promise me something. Anything. When love finds you, you let it in. Even if it doesn't feel like the right time, or it doesn't look exactly like how you thought. Promise me you'll give it a shot. I promise. Good. Okay, who's up for Christmas charades? - Let's do it. - Let's do this. I call these guys. Glad you feel right at home. Hey. What? Nothing. Can you help me with something? Uh yeah, sure. Oh, thank you for getting those floor plans approved so quickly. Not a problem. What's it say? Uh, six feet. Great. Oh! I'm so sorry. It's tricks, tricks of the trade. Hey, Holly. Hi, Mr. Pine. What's first on the list today? I was thinking Christmas tree. Christmas tree. My favorite part. Me too. I promise I won't disappoint. Great. Okay, let's measure the space for the tree so um, could you hold this? - Yep. - Like that, perfect. - Sorry. Sorry. - It's okay. Oh, I got it. Yeah. I'm good. - Uh... - A little higher. Okay. Higher. Significantly higher. Smidge lower. Mmm, split the difference. Ten feet. Perfect. I'm pretty sure no one's going to notice the actual height of the Christmas tree, though. Well, maybe not consciously. But if it's too small, it's going to feel sparse. If it's too big, it's going to feel overcrowded. And subconsciously they're going to feel like their entire experience of this party is ruined. Just get your coat. Okay. Isn't this place magical? Oh yeah, yep. But I just know we are going to find the perfect tree here. I feel it in my bones. Whatever you say, boss. Hey. What's up? Nothing, it's just I have a lot going on at the office with the pitch. That one looks right, yeah? No, it's definitely too short. Also, I need to be able to hang ornaments, lights, garland. Oh yeah. So if there's so much going on back at the office, why was your dad so adamant about you being involved in the party planning process? If you don't mind me asking. You mean all of your clients don't make their offspring participate in your trades? Yeah, no. This would be a first for me. That makes two of us. So tell me about the pitch. Well, I put in a bid to design and build Denver's new city centre, but it's just not going according to plan. You bit off more than you could chew? No, no, no, no. I think that Pine Architecture could do very well in the commercial sphere, but I feel like going so hard right out of the gate on the first contract might not have been the best idea. We're just so behind the other companies. Hmm. Hmm. I don't know. I mean, those models that I saw at the office, those are gorgeous. My dad actually makes all those. We hardly do anything digital. He still mails handwritten thank you notes. I think that's sweet. It is, but we are going to have to modernize if we want to move forward. Which is why I was so resistant to put so much energy into this whole Christmas party planning thing, because I feel like it's a distraction from the real presentation. Measuring Christmas trees isn't going to make anyone innovate. What's wrong with that one? It's not full enough. Oh. Right. Of course. So, do you always put in this much effort? Little Christmas parties are pretty cookie cutter, no? Well, yep. They can be. But I strive to make them more than that. I want to create an experience that my client's going to remember, you know? Something that evokes an emotion they can look back on years later after the event and smile. Are we getting warmer? Uh yeah, slightly warmer. Gotta take your time. How'd you get into this? The party planning thing. Oh, in college I studied hospitality and event management, and then after winning a Christmas tree decorating competition... Oh, I'm shocked. I got an internship at a big firm in New York, but they only took on huge clients and I was lacking that personal connection that I feel like makes events so important. Like us? Exactly. Yeah, I want to create that personal connection with someone. I want to get to know the client and then make something special for them. And I started working for Encore a couple years ago. Why are you laughing? I'm not laughing. - Oh, you're not? - No. Don't! - I wouldn't. - No? No! Okay. All right. Fine. There you go. Oh, I'm going to- Don't, don't. Three, two, one... Oh my... I am so sorry, Mayor Donahue. It's fine, Theo. No need to apologize. It's been a long time since I've had a snowball fight. Hey, who won? I did. She did. Anthony Donahue. Hi, nice to meet you. Pleasure to meet you. Searching for a tree, are we Theo? Yes, sir. We are for the Christmas party. Oh, my little Camilla cannot wait. She says it's her favorite event of the year. All she can talk about is how excited she is to see your party. That is very sweet of her. We have Holly Green from Encore Events on the job so she will not be disappointed. Oh, and the pitch. I'm very excited to see the 3D model of your design. Don't get me wrong, love the digital stuff. There's something magical about what you and your father put together. Uh, I'm sorry. Is that a Smith Family Farms keychain from the grand opening? Absolutely, and every year since. It's my family's favorite spot. Ours too! We've gotten a tree here every year for... - Ten years. - Ten years. Exactly. What a small world. Best kept secret in all of Denver. And we want to keep it that way. Agreed. Love to stay, but I have some Christmas tree shopping to do myself. Holly, it was a pleasure to meet you. Nice to meet you. And Theo, please give my best to your father and we'll see you both very soon. Okay. Okay. Your dad was wrong. The party isn't as important as the pitch, it's more important. And luckily, I found us the perfect tree. Holly: Trust me. The 10 foot tree is the way to go. I know what I'm talking about. Theo: Okay. Broom hockey. Hey guys, can we have a turn? - Okay. - What are you doing? Let's play. I'm wearing a suit. Care to make it interesting? How could we possibly do that? How about for every goal that I score, I get to ask you a question? Okay. But every time I score a goal... I get to ask you a question back. Deal. Three, two, one. Ugh. Aww. I forgot to warn you, I'm great. - There you go. - Thank you, sir. Okay. Favorite Christmas memory. Decorating the tree with my family while drinking hot cocoa. And after we finished, we'd cozy up by the fire and my grandpa would read us all a Christmas story. - That sounds magical. - Mmm-hmm. Three, two, one. Two, one. Wow. Two for two. Thank you sir, what a gentleman. All right. Favorite Christmas dessert. My mom's lemon ginger ice box cake. Hands down. I love lemon ginger ice box cake. Have you ever had the one from Leno's on the corner? Uh, Leno's is stellar but still not quite as good as my mom's. I'm sure. Three, two, one. Yes! All right. What you got? Would you ever strike out on your own? What do you mean? Leave Encore? Yeah. Do your own thing. Yeah. One day. I just want to make sure I have enough experience. What do you mean? Well, there's a tier system at Encore. You start out as a junior planner and you work with a lead planner. And there's my position. You get to work on small to medium events on your own. And then there's lead planner, where you'd have a team of people that work for you. Those are the kind of people that get to do the grand opening at the City Center. I just want to get there before I leave. Make sure I'm really ready. You seem pretty ready to me. Well, if your Christmas party goes well, I might be lead planner by the end of the year. Well I think I should end on a high note, and we should get hot chocolate. Hot cocoa sounds amazing. I'm freezing. - Thank you. - Thank you. Okay, so we need to book the rentals, hire the caterers, secure decor, and most importantly, pick a theme. Enter Holly's Christmas party questionnaire. It's how I tailor the perfect party for each client. Okay, themes. Isn't the theme Christmas? Sure. But the Christmas genre has a lot of sub-themes within it. You know, like Santa's workshop, winter wonderland, white elephant, crafting. The list goes on and on. You look overwhelmed. Okay, what does Christmas mean to you? Good food, maybe? Right. All right. Um, let's try this. Okay. Don't think about it, just pick the first three that stand out to you. What is... Don't think about it. Okay. Nice. Great combination. So, elegant, featuring snow, with an element of toys. Upscale North Pole. We can mix elegant with fun, black tie with a playful twist. That sounds not terrible. Great. Not terrible is just a little bit below what I was aiming for, but I will take it. So um, those 3D models. Those are really cool. I've actually never done one. That's my dad's thing. Well looks like you're going to have to. I'm not really the best crafter that's ever lived. What? You? No! But it sounds right up your alley. Yeah, it definitely is. This one time I was planning a Christmas party I couldn't find the right decorations, so I just made them out of clay and pipe cleaners. Oh wow. How did that turn out? Well, the guests tried to take them home as party favors, so I would say it's a huge success. Sounds like it. Well, if you're up for it, I would like to formally enlist your help. I mean, since I am helping you plan the party, it's the least you can do. I'd love to help. But it has to be perfect. I think you're being too hard on yourself. I heard Mayor Donahue talking about you and the company. He's really rooting for you. And so am I. Thank you. Okay... Let's get back to elegance. You're here late. Just trying to catch up on everything I missed today. Taking my advice, are we? Well uh, I may have run into Mayor Donahue today and he may have hinted that he would like to see one of our classic models. - Hmm. - So you were right. How did it go with Holly? Good. Yep. Fine. She has a very unconventional way of working. Is that so? Yeah, like not in a bad way. Just... different. I'll leave you to it. What is the first thing elves learn in school? Uh, algebra? No, the elfabet. Oh. Ha, ha. Very funny. You come up with that yourself? You need to work on your material. What, says the guy in a onesie at the office? Hey! This is kind of cute, isn't it? Uh, North Pole chic. What was that? Ah. What? What, with Nick? Nothing. Nothing's going on with Nick. Ew. If you say so. Hi, Mr. Pine. Holly, nice to see you. What's on the docket today? Actually, I was going to do a little bit of Christmas shopping. Get some North Pole d√©cor. Theo, I was hoping you'd come with me. I would love to. Great. Okay. Come on. So, we have a tree topper and the party favors. I ordered those lights online, they should be here in a couple of days. We just still need the ornaments. I really want to find something that straddles the line between elegant and playful. Easier said than done, I assume? Hopefully not. You never know with these things. What are you looking at? Is that the old city center? Let me see. Yeah. Hmm. Looks like it could use a facelift. You're an active member in the Denver community. And proud of it. What do you use the space for? I don't. Why not? I think the outdoor space is sorely underutilized. I wish they did more, like, local events out there. Do you like the building now? Not particularly. If it was up to me, I would hope that it would stand out. Okay, and how would you do that? Mmm, add glitter probably. Glitter? Yeah. I'm kidding, I have no idea. We're missing something. Focal point. Yeah. Something that draws you in. Did you ever come here on school... - School field trips? - Yeah. I'm glad it's quiet today, but man I loved those when I was a kid. It was my favorite day of the year. Oh, mine too. I used to buy my parents Christmas presents with the money I saved from school lunch. Usually I could only afford an ornament, but my Dad still puts them all up on the tree. Aww. My family does something similar. We pick one ornament a year to represent the whole thing, like a soccer ball or a graduation cap. My grandma started it a long time ago, and it's a tradition that I hope to carry on with my own family someday. So your Christmas tree is basically the stories of all your lives woven together? Exactly. So, which one do you prefer? That one. You don't seem so sure. They look the same. Yeah, we'll come back to ribbon. The ornaments are more important to choose first anyway. Is that a good gasp or a bad gasp? Oh, that's a good gasp! Those are beautiful. What do you think? I would be as bold as to say they're perfect. Me too. We'll take them all. - Hi. - Hey. Oh. Oh, no, no, no, no. I got it. You got the hot chocolate. Thank you. Let's see what you got. Okay. Here we go. Oh. That was pretty close. Hmm. That was worse, all right. Last one... I got it... I didn't get it. I'll, I'll give it a shot. - Really? - Yeah. Okay. So you're good at this. I guess those years of little league were good for something. Hmm. Oh, for the lady. Thank you. Actually, this is for you. Oh. It's just to remember that you do have everything you need right inside you there. And also to remember that very first year that you ever planned a Christmas party. I don't think I'll be forgetting this anytime soon. Because I won. Right. Time for crafting. Crafting. Come on. Okay... Follow me. There sure is a lot going on here. Ooh, pom-poms. Pom-poms, really? What's wrong with pom-poms? They're just kind of boring. Boring? Pom-poms? Pom-poms are the best. Take it back. No. What? Pom-poms, no? - No, don't like them? - Hey! She started it. I didn't. Yes, you did. You totally did. Are you throwing me under the bus? Yes. Sorry, we'll clean it up. Wow. I know we're on a tight schedule, but I would love to show you my plans for the pitch. They're not perfect and I haven't shown anyone yet, but... I'd be honored. What do you think? I think this will work. Oh, you're just, oh wow. See, I actually made mine look terrible on purpose so yours would look really good. Is that how you charm all the ladies? It works every time. Oh, so you are a ladies man? Just kidding. I actually got out of a relationship a while ago. So I've just been focusing on work. How about you? Same. Yeah I, after my last relationship, I just decided that I wanted to just focus on my career. None of those pesky feelings getting in the way, right? Exactly. Since we're being transparent, I let you win at broom ball. Sure you did. Whatever you have to tell yourself. Did it work? Are you charmed? Oh, I'm the most charmed. That's what I thought. Oh, oh we're going. Come on you charmer. My car's just around the corner. I can give you a ride home. Oh, I'm actually not going home. I'm going to my parents. But it's not far. Oh no, it's getting dark. I insist. Come on. Okay. Okay, so tomorrow we have to order a garland, get that North Pole playlist together and confirm the numbers for the caterer. - Oh. - Oh. - Hi Holly. - Hi Mom. Uh, this is my client, Theo Pine. Theo, this is my mom, Lydia. - Hey. - Lovely to meet you. This is perfect because you can take Felix's place. He's stuck at work. Place for what? Gingerbread night. Oh... Oh Mom, I'm sure that Theo has work. I would love to, Miss Green. But as long as my boss says it's okay. Okay, it's settled. I'll see you guys inside. Yeah, my mom takes gingerbread night very seriously, just so you're prepared. Well, of course she does, because gingerbread night is very serious business. That looks nice. So, you've met mom, Lydia. This is my dad, Sam, and my sister, Joy. - Mr. Green, nice to meet you. - You too. - Nice to meet you, Joy. - Nice to meet you. The pleasure's all ours, and don't mind the mess. Yeah. We're in the middle of remodeling. It's a five-year remodel. Oh. Yeah. It's best not to ask questions. Dad fancies himself a DIY home remodeler. I don't fancy. - I am. - I am. Well, if this is your work, I'm a fan. Don't listen to them. Is something wrong? Oh no, I'm just making... A bit of a perfectionist, maybe? Getting started is the hardest part. What's going on there? I'm adding some dimension. Dad uh, lives for a little bit of character. If you hadn't noticed. Ah. Okay. Here. Voila. Oh! That is very cool, Dad. Yeah. Not bad for a book editor. Dad works in publishing. Yeah. Publishing pays the bills, but home renovation fills the soul. I hope I'm not overstepping, but I'd be happy to help with any projects you have Mr. Green. Growing up on sites, I dare say I'm a grout master. I like this guy. All right, well if you're coming over, don't forget to bring your grout goggles. What are... grout goggles? It's best not to ask. Theo, Holly tells me that you're about to take over your family's business. Yep. Uh, we have an architecture firm downtown, but I promise I'm better at building real houses than gingerbread ones. Hey Dad, can you flash that light one more time? Yeah. Happy to. Oh, that would be so cool if you could do something like that in the city center. You know, like a, like a skylight? I don't know, something like that? Just for that focal point that you were hoping for. It's just an idea. So, thanks again for offering to help my dad. Seriously, it was all my pleasure. I'm actually really excited. Good. Okay. I'll see you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. Well. Isn't he a doll? Yeah. He really is. Hey Joy, would you come with me? I've got this video I want to show you. It's about how to install a hot water heater at home. No, Dad, no! Dad... No, it's just... No, come with, bear with me. It's good to know these things. Someone's in a good mood. Because it's the most wonderful time of the year. What's this? Inspiration! Oh, Holly... Peppermint mocha? Thank you. Here, let me grab your coat. Oh. - Oh my hair. - Oh, sorry. No worries. Do you want to have a seat? I saved you one. Oh. Am I being buttered up? Possibly. Okay, I was thinking about what you were saying last night. Which was? About the skylight. I think you were really onto something. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. Pitch it to me. Well, uh, it's not like fully flushed out yet. Okay, maybe this was a bad idea. Come on, it doesn't have to be perfect. Just tell me what you're mulling over. So, based on inspiration from you, I was thinking a raised skylight with a silhouette of the Rocky Mountains and then paying homage to the Colorado landscape. That's awesome, like you're really onto something. But? But ooh, ah, what if instead of a skylight, it's a sun dial, and then it illuminates different parts of the mountains at different times? That's actually so original and very unique and totally Denver. Yeah. That's, that's great. Thanks. Uh, what else is on the list today? Uh, I have to make a North Pole playlist. Oh. Cool. And you have to make a model. How about we make a deal? I'll help you with the model if you help me with the list. Deal. Should we get started? No, not here. What? Why not? Because we're being creative. Oh. And this is not a creative space. Follow me. What is this place? This is my family's creative space. This is where my dad keeps all of his like, DIY stuff, my mom's crafting. So all these Christmas decorations are yours? Oh, no, no, no. This is just my back stock. I keep my favorite ones at my apartment for easy access. How do you not run your own party planning business yet? I mean, you have everything you need right here. Yes. I definitely have plenty of supplies. So, let's get started. Oh, like I said, I've actually never done this on my own before. I have no idea how to use that. Oh, I haven't either. So we're on an even playing field. Mmm-hmm. Shall we get started? We shall. Come have a seat. Good King Wenceslas looked out On the Feast of Stephen When the snow lay round about Deep and crisp and even Brightly shone the moon that night Though the frost was cruel When a poor man came in sight Gathering winter fuel Take it out Hither, page, and stand by me If thou know it, telling Yonder peasant, who is he? Where and what his dwelling? Sire, he lives a good league hence Underneath the mountain Right against the forest fence This playlist is looking good. It is. I definitely want this song. What do you think? Only if you use that as your grand entrance. Done. Okay, how many more songs do we need? Uh, actually, just the final one. Okay. Oh, how about this one? May I? Thank you. How about this one? Yeah, I just think that one's like a little too like... Yeah, you're right. It should be more wind down. Okay, uh... I love this song. Oh, that's my favorite. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. Wow. No way. You know how to waltz? Well actually, technically what you're doing isn't a waltz. A waltz is in 3/4. That's more like a foxtrot or a rumba, which is in 4/4. Theo Pine, are you a ballroom dancer? I might have taken a class or two in college. Ready? Okay. - Ah! - You got it. Okay... Okay, ready? Okay, now out. Okay. Nice. Mmm-hmm. - Oh wow. - Ready for this? Oh. Well. And that's how you waltz. Wow. And I think that song is perfect. That's a beautiful way to end an evening. It is. Uh, I'm going to get it. Oh. The Christmas decorations and tree will be ready by tomorrow. Nice. Yeah. My dad is so excited about you helping him lay that tile. He can't stop talking about it. Well, your dad is a great guy. I would be happy to do it. Yeah, he is, he is. Uh. He can also be a little spirited, so we should probably have a code word in case that gets to be too much. Oh. Something like, "Where is Santa's hat?" No, that's terrible. How about like, "Who ate the last sugar cookie?" - That's, that's worse. - That's worse, yeah. Rudolph. Just Rudolph? Just keep it simple, just say it like loudly. Commit to Rudolph. - Rudolph it is. - Rudolph it is. Oh. Oh, shoot that's Blaire. I should get back and fill her in on the new design. Is there anything else you need from me? No, you're all good. Okay. I'll just... Yeah. I'll just get this for you. Oh. You got it. Okay. See you tomorrow. Yeah, first thing. Well... Is it bad? No! Theo, it's stunning. The mayor's going to love this. Okay, yeah. Lay it on me. I know you've got something. Just one suggestion: he loves Christmas so much. Maybe you could add some Christmas decorations? Holly, that is genius. You're just such an amazing... Decorator. Hey Theo. Oh, Miss Green. - Hi. - Hi. Holly was just saying that we should add some festive decorations to the model to make it more Christmassy. A unique and personal touch. I like it. Great. Well, the Christmas tree should be here any minute. Theo, want to come get it with me? Yeah. Man. Why don't you let the tall guy do it? No. I got it. Yeah. - You sure? - Yeah. I don't think you can even reach the top. Hey! Am I wrong? No. Here? I am only relenting because of decorating efficiency. That is perfect, thank you. So. I hear someone crushed their first model. Well it's not perfect, but... Nothing is perfect. But you came pretty close. Thank you. So I guess that's all the decorating tonight? No. Hmm. We still have all of the ornaments. Oh wow, so we're going to be here all night. It's a lot, yeah. I like that one though. There are worse ways to spend an evening. That's very true. Yeah. Wow. Now that is a Christmas tree. What are you two doing here? My computer needed a reboot. Yeah. It's a good thing I'm so techie. Hah. You want some help? Ooh, ornaments. Do you see what I see? Should we set them up? Well if we did, we'd have to do it in secret. Ooh, we could like trap them in an elevator. Oh, or lock them in an office. Or what if they like met at a coffee shop and then like, reached for the same bag at the same time? We can, we can circle back to that. Yeah. You're big on Christmas? Uh, massive. Uh, what about you Holls? What's your favorite Christmas tradition? Ooh. My family does the cutest thing on Christmas Eve. We do like, breakfast for dinner and my mom cooks everything. Eggs Benedict and bacon, like anything you want. - Delicious. - Yeah. My family does like the same thing. Except we have this big roast, and then mashed potatoes, green beans, and then always my mom's famous lemon ginger icebox cake. - Oh, so good. - So good. Uh, favorite Christmas movie? Mine's The Grinch. What? That's my favorite movie. - Really? - Yeah. What about you, Theo? Oh, Miracle on 34th Street. Ultimate classic. Totally. Uh, Christmas presents on Christmas Eve or Christmas morning? - Christmas Eve. - Christmas Eve. Wow. - Yeah, okay. - Maybe we should... - It's getting... late. - It's kind of late. We should check on the computer program. Rebooting of course. Yeah. It's probably rebooted. For sure. Yeah. You guys are doing great. Um, looks fantastic. Festive. Blaire: Okay. Nick: See you guys. They totally have a crush on each other. That is it, or he's just very excited for his New Year's bonus. Okay, what's next on the list? Well, I just have a few things left in my office, so tomorrow you're all free. So I won't see you tomorrow? No. But Saturday I would love help with the load-in. I'd love to see you Saturday. I'd be happy to help. Okay. It's just... I know it's lame, but I thought we could do it together because I'm really bad at decorations. So I kind of need your help. I don't know where to put it. Is this a good spot? What do you think? I think that looks great. I have to get my coat. Your coat? Here. - Oh, thanks. - Okay. Holly... Oh! See you Saturday. Goodnight. Okay, bye. I think she likes you. And let's add in the wagyu beef sliders. Those are always a hit. Great, thank you Carl. You're the best. Bye. Carl? Of Taste Catering Carl? Mmm-hmm. You got him for the PA event? How? All the other planners say that he's booked until February. Yeah, he's an old friend. Oh. I gotta say, I am very, very impressed. Huge favor to ask. I need a day-of coordinator for the charity event downtown tonight. Might be good, you know, get in one more event. Let the board know that you're really ready. If you have the bandwidth. Yes, of course I do. I'll squeeze that right in. Love it. You are a lifesaver. I'm going to email you the deets right now. Carl. Impressed. Look at that. She looks just like you, Joy. We don't even know if it's a girl yet, Dad. Oh yes we do. She's a girl. Trust me. I know these things. Well, for the record I hope you're right. I am. Hey guys, sorry I'm late. Hi. How was it? Kind of weird, but really cool. It was amazing. Oh, my gosh you guys. Look at that. She looks just like Joy, doesn't she? Oh, that's nice. Yeah. Oh, sorry. Hey. Hey, can I swing by the office? I really want to practice the pitch one more time before this afternoon. It'll be quick, I promise. Ooh, I'm not at the office right now. I'm actually at my family's house. Oh. Uh, I'm so sorry. I didn't... Hi Theo. Listen, why don't you come on down and pitch it to all of us? What was that? Doing it in front of an audience will help you get your nerves out. That's true. Well I wouldn't want to impose. No, no imposition. Just come on down. Impose man, impose. We've got nothing but time. Are you sure? Positive. The people have spoken. Okay, uh, I'll be there in 10. Okay. What? Are you going to tell him? Tell him what? That you have a crush on him? I do not have a crush on him. Yeah, okay, yeah. I don't! Yeah no, we all believe you. Dad! Don't look at me... There we go. Put that right there. Yeah. So, whenever you're ready, Theo. Okay, um, well, as many of you know, Pine Architecture has been... And in closing, the focal point of the main building will feature a skylight that also acts as a sundial to pay homage to the Colorado landscape. Theo, that's fantastic. You crushed it. So good. Theo! Thanks guys. I completely agree. You're ready. Stay for some hot cocoa? I would love to, but I have to go. Okay. Right, well, next time then. Oh, yes sir. Next time. We will hold you to that. Deal. Theo. That was so great. You don't think it's too simple? I think sometimes simple is perfect. How about you? About the promotion, I mean. Oh, uh yeah. Eve has me filling in for an event tonight, so... Oh, another one? Yeah. She thought it would be good for the board to see. I don't want to speak out of line, but is it possible that they're just stringing you along? I mean, I've known you for a week and you should be running that company. I mean, you're so talented and driven. I guess what I'm trying to say is you deserve answers, and you deserve that promotion. Just something to check out. Okay. But I should go. Please tell your family they're really great and thanks again. Yeah. They are great. Well. - Yeah. - Okay. Guess I need this. Yeah, get that. Yeah. - Okay. - All right. Text me when you're done. I think we're going to have to bump that up because I don't want to miss the deadline, so. I can definitely get the electrical plans done by then. - Okay, great. - Ooh! - Woah! - Here it is. Man, that looks amazing. That is beautiful. It looks awesome man. Ooh, you know what else looks awesome? Is it time? I think it is. Wait, time for what? - Are you ready for this? - Are you? - Am I ready? - Let's do it. Wooo! Oh, yeah! Oh no. Oh no! Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no! I am so sorry. No, no, no. It's not your fault. It's my fault, I should've been more careful. Uh... The pitch is in an hour. What are we going to do? It's okay. I will figure something out, okay? We're just going to go with plan B. I'm going to present the blueprints, and Blaire, can you make a digital copy of the model to give to the mayor when it's ready? Yeah, but I definitely can't do that within the next hour. That's totally fine. Um, I will let him know we ran into a little bit of a snafu and we'll get him something before the new year. Is that enough time? Absolutely, yeah. I'll, I'll get on it. - I'll help you out. - Thank you. And thank you everyone for coming in today and listening to the pitch. And is there a model of your design? Uh no, not at the moment. We ran into a little hiccup, but my digital team will get a copy to yours before the new year. Okay, um... Well, thank you for your time, Theo. You as well, sir. Hey. How'd it go? Honestly, I feel pretty good about what we gave him. And please thank your family again for letting me practice on them today. Are you kidding? They loved it. Did you explain what happened with the model? Well, I didn't want to make any excuses so I just told him that we'd get him a digital copy stat. And he was okay with that? We'll see. Okay. Well I'm just finishing setting up for the party. So I will see you first thing in the morning for load in. If anything else happens just let me know, okay? I will. Okay, bye. Holly. Oh, Mayor Donahue. What are you doing here? I'm on the board and drew the straw that oversees the setup. And you have done a beautiful, beautiful job. Thank you. Listen, I have a question for you. What's it like working with Theo? I know his father Richard well and trust him deeply, but Theo's a bit of a wildcard. Yeah. It's just because he's got so many ideas. But his heart's in the right space. So you'd trust him with something as big as this contract? If you were to ask me a week ago, I would have said no. Oh. Because you know Theo. No. It's, he's just, he's laser focused you know? He's very specific once he gets an idea in his head he's just like ooh, you can't get that thing out of there. But he's passionate and kind and smart. And yes, he's young and he's eager, but he's got great vision. So what I'm trying to say is yes, I think that he would be great for the city center contract. Okay, good. Well thank you for your time, Miss Green. I'll let you get back to work. Okay. Enjoy. Thanks. Hey kiddo. I just wanted to congratulate you on another gorgeous event last night. - Thank you! - Great job. Oh, Eve? Yes. I uh, I was just wondering. Have you heard anything from the board about my promotion? Yeah. I, I did not want you to hear about this today. You have gone above and beyond this season, and you know your work is fantastic. But? But, I, I heard this morning that the board is going to go with another candidate. Really? It's somebody who's been here longer, just a little bit more seasoned. I'm really sorry, Holly. But you know what? We're going to try again next year, okay? Yeah. Okay. Okay... You know what? No. I don't want to wait another year. I deserve to be running my own team. Yes, you do. We just, we can't give that to you right now. Okay. Well then, I'm sorry, but I can't do this anymore. I'm going to have to quit. Okay. But you need to know, you are a huge asset to Encore, and I really wish that I could give you what you deserve. As much as I don't want to see you leave, you're going to do great wherever you go. I mean that. Thank you. I will follow through with the Pine Architecture party because there's a lot riding on that. But after that, I'm going to have to be done. I understand. Holly? I am so proud of you. You are a fantastic party planner. You know what? Thank you for everything, Eve. Thank you. Okay. I don't understand. Receptionist: I'm sorry sir, all I know is that the mayor's going in a different direction at this time. But he wanted to thank you again for your efforts. That doesn't make any sense. How did this happen? Well, all I know is that he mentioned someone named Holly. I didn't catch everything he said, but he made it clear it was because of her. Thank you. You're welcome. Theo, hi. What did you say? What? To who? Mayor Donahue? Did you say something to Mayor Donahue? Back up. What's going on? You tell me, Holly. His office called and told me we lost the contract. What? How is that possible? His assistant said it was because something you said to him. When did you go see the mayor? I didn't go see him. I mean, I saw him last night at a charity event. And you spoke to him about me? Uh, he asked me a few questions, like if I thought you were ready to handle such a big contract. And what did you say? I said when I first met you that I, I didn't think that you were ready. So you said no, that I wasn't ready. No, I said when I first met you then I didn't think that you were ready, but now that I thought you were absolutely ready. Holly, you have known me for a week. And he knows that you've known me for a week, so how much can a person change in that short period of time? Apparently, a lot. Because you have. Well that doesn't really matter, because we lost the contract. Theo, I'm sorry. I'm, I'm so sorry. You know, it's fine. But I no longer require your services. Come on, let me just finish the party and I can fix this. It's okay. I will handle it myself. Really. I insist. Holly. What are you doing here? Shouldn't you be getting ready for the party? I'm not going. Why? Because I messed everything up. - Oh... - I left Encore today. Oh. It turns out they were never going to give me that promotion. So I quit. And then I messed everything up with the mayor and it cost Theo the contract. Well. First thing's first. I'm surprised you didn't quit long before this. You've been running the show at that company for years. You don't have to wait for them to deem you ready, Holly. You're too good for that. Now you can focus on events that you'd like to create. And Theo, I'm sure you didn't mean for him to lose the contract. I didn't. I really didn't. Well, I think you should get ready, go to that party, tell the mayor what you meant, and then go tell that boy that you have feelings for him. Because you do. It's written all over your face. I don't, I don't even have anything to wear. My dress is at the apartment. Nonsense. I have the perfect dress for you. I was cleaning out the closet the other day and look what I found. It's Grandma's gowns. Yeah. I think the red one would be perfect. Me too. Thanks Mom. I'll go put it on. Okay. Ready for the big night? Hey. Hey, what's wrong? We're out. What? Out of the running for the contract. What happened? I let us down. Which means my dad's going to have to go through with those layoffs. But I did put in a bid to develop new homes in this new development on the East Side. But until that goes through... I'm confused. I thought you didn't want to build family homes anymore. Family homes are what built this company. And I want to move into commercial, but not if it means losing what makes us special. Yeah. Uh, Nick. Please don't say anything yet. I don't want to ruin the night, okay? Of course. My lips are sealed, I promise. Thanks man. See you out there. Okay, you guys ready? Both: Yes. Oh, Holly. You look beautiful. Stunning. Thanks you guys. Wait, why are you so dressed up? Hey, you're not the only one that gets invited to fancy Christmas parties around here. Okay Dad, touch√©. Honey. Following your heart is always the right choice. Not always the easiest one, but always the right choice. Go follow your heart. Now go enjoy yourself. Okay. Have fun. Quite the event you and Miss Green managed to pull off here today. Thank you sir. Is she here? I haven't seen her. My family is having a blast. Your pitch today, so many great ideas. I loved the skylight sundial thing. Fantastic. That was all Holly. Actually a lot of that design was her. I just had the rough ideas and she helped me refine them. So sorry to hear about your model. I mean, what I saw of it? Stunning. You know you're very lucky to have someone like Miss Holly Green supporting you. You know that, Theo? I have to say, Son. Congratulations are in order. I'm not going to lie Dad, this party was all Holly. Not about that. I saw you put us in for the bid for the Hanson community. You realize those are houses, right? I do. You were right. Building family homes where people make memories, that's what this company is about. And I'm sorry that I was so off-base. I was just trying to show you that I deserve to take over as CEO because I'm good at it, and not just because I'm your son. You did that. As well as securing the city center contract. But that call from the mayor's office. I thought we were out of the running. That was a mistake. She called to correct it this afternoon. Mayor Donahue did have some doubts at the beginning, but you proved him wrong. And his conversation with Holly helped immensely. Gave him that outside perspective. You have so much talent. You just needed to get out of your own way. Working with Holly, I've seen a different side of you. I'm really proud of you. Where is Holly, anyway? Oh no. I told her not to come. You what? Because I thought her conversation with the mayor cost us the contract. I didn't know it secured it for us. Oh man, I should've known. Part of leadership is knowing you're going to make mistakes. It's how you handle the mistake that matters most. You should call her. She's something special, that one. Holly, there you are. Fantastic party. Oh! Thank you sir. Um, actually I wanted to talk to you about last night. I'm worried that I said something that might have gotten misconstrued. No, no. I think I heard you loud and clear. You and Theo work so well together and now that he's doing the build, it makes sense to hire you to do the opening. Me? Yes! Yes. He said he's going to be ready probably in late summer. Sure. So I'd love to see what you come up with. Great. Theo's very lucky to have someone like you in his corner. Thank you. Obviously there's going to be a lot of other projects that I want to talk to you about, so my office will give you a call very soon. Fantastic work. Thank you. To you and your kin We wish you a Merry Christmas and a happy New Year Hi. Congratulations. Eve will be thrilled. You secured that promotion, no? Actually, there isn't a promotion. The board decided to go another way, so I quit. That's a huge loss for them. Look Theo, I just, I really want to say I'm so sorry. No, no, I'm sorry. I had the whole situation wrong. It was because of you we landed the contract. - You did? - Yeah. And I am so sorry that I would ever think you would jeopardize that. So I hope you accept my apology. I don't know. Of course! You got the contract? You got the contract! And it was all because of you. I couldn't have done it without you, Holly. I don't know how to say this. Holly, you challenge me and make me laugh, and you've made me happier than I ever thought that I could be. And I know that I'm stubborn... And a little bit of a perfectionist. Yeah, that might be true. But I've never met anyone like you. And you are so kind and sometimes a little high strung, but whatever you set out to do, you can literally accomplish it. Um, Holly? I'm falling for you and I can't imagine life without you. Theo... Holly! You're here. Hey! Yes. I'm here. You're here? Oh, I love this song. Shall we dance? Well I could never say no to Mr. Claus. What do you say? Do you want to dance? Of course. I heard the dance floor has got some good spring. It does. I've been thinking... you're probably the only person on earth who's funnier than me. Wow. Oh Nicholas. Was that a compliment? I was just thinking maybe we could go to dinner sometime? I wouldn't hate that. Is that a date? It's a date. Nice. What are they doing here? I invited them. I told you we had a fancy Christmas party to go to tonight. Sneaky! - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - Hey. - Hi, Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas to you. This night turned out pretty magical, huh? It sure did. I would say the memories from this experience are priceless. Me too. And I wanted to tell you I'm falling for you too. Merry Christmas everybody!
