I had a rough go-see at Balor's agency this morning. - [Photographer] Oh yeah? Was it an obnoxious little dude named Danobe? - Yeah, he wanted to test the merchandise. Like he was buying melons. - [Photographer] Don't take it too personal. He does it to all the girls. - Not this girl. - [Photographer] So tell me, did you get the job? - What do you think? - [Photographer] I think you should look at the camera and be gorgeous. ♪ You are my one and only ♪ Yes, you're my one and only love ♪ ♪ You are my one and only ♪ Yes, you're my one and only love ♪ - [Photographer] Marcus, do you have that small fan?

[laughing] [upbeat ensemble trumpet music] - There are 2500 shares. Buy them, darling. Thank you, Roger. Someday I'll find a stockbroker that can teach me something. - Oh come on, I don't think anybody could teach you shit. - Do you eat with the same mouth? - Mm hmm, smoke too. - Oh, thank you. - You feeling all right, Avril? - Yeah, terrific. - Hey, what's Kit doin' here? - I'm looking for my friends. - Yes. - Hey, Kit, over here. - I think I found them, thank you. Thank you, hello girls, so. [electronic whirring] - So what do you think, huh? - Cairo, I think you've just been replaced. - Oh cute. What is that? - Oh well, that's a wise old owl. Yamashiro brought it from Tokyo. - Yeah well tell me, what does the wise old owl do, huh? - Take a look. - Yeah well tell me, what does the wise old owl do, huh? [laughing] Now that's impressive. - I wanna be the first kid on my block. - Nah, it's too expensive for mass marketing. I told Yamashiro to go back to the drawing board and finish his 3D model. If we can beat the big boys to the marketplace with this baby, Leisure 80 stock will jump off the charts. - [Craig] And sweep into America's hearts. - Again, Blitzstein. - [Craig] I can see it now Sloane, an owl on every bedroom ceiling, recording tidal wave conditions in waterbeds. [laughing] - Hey what are you doing? - You didn't want your haircut. - Nobody understands me. - Oh, sweetheart. He's misunderstood. - Hey, hey, hey, a little respect, all right? - That's what you got, a little respect. - Wet his bed 'til he was eight. - I'll stick that in the bathroom with you and then we'll all know. - Oh mister dirty, mister dirty. [laughing] - Wait a minute, we're getting real tacky here, I think just slightly excited. - Pardon me. - Who ordered that? - I don't know. Did you? - I didn't order it. - Oh god, what exactly happened? - He's the worst. Oh yeah, he's like that. - Thank you. - Thank you. - He looks like him. The one in the middle looks just like DeNova. [laughing] - Come on, could happen to any of us. It's not your fault. - You didn't hear Walter on the phone. He was positively glacial. - That's Walter, we still put up with that. - Look, it's easy for you Tessa, you're on top. She's in the $4,000 a day category while I'm in a permanent holding pattern. - Listen princess, you can have any dream you want if you just wait for it. - Hey, I'm not complaining, it's just that I had a chance to make a jump yesterday until that arrogant son of a bitch-- - Listen darling, if you don't want him, you just send him my way because he's my kind of guy. [laughing] - Listen ladies, I hate to break this up but I have to go to the bank. You know what day it is. - Rinse day. - That's right. [mid tempo bass guitar music] - All right, I'll set up those speakers when I get back, all right? Okay Raoul, we're in the wind, all right? - Taxi. Taxi. - All right Raoul, this isn't a driver's ed course, will you move your ass please? - One of us has to have a driving license, you know. - You're never gonna let me forget that, are you? Hey, why don't you remind me to bring my glasses? You're always forgetting. - Oh yeah? I notice you never forget your cigarettes. - Nag, nag, nag. All right, all right, pull over, come on, stop the car, I'm gonna drive, come on. - Okay, okay, it's all you. - I bet you're an actress, aren't ya? - Model. Can't you go any faster? I'm really gonna be late. - Look, this isn't a goddamn helicopter, lady. Can't fly over 'em. - Harrison, I wanna talk to you. Look, everything's screwed up, I'm running at least an hour late. So I want you to get on the phone to Burt and Moss and straighten it out right now, okay? What, what are you saying? Hey, this is what you're paid for, man. - Cheers. - Come on, you're a lawyer, lie. [relaxed jazzy trumpet music] [tires screeching] [crashing] [car horn blaring] You guys ever hear of Leisure 80 Enterprises? We make home video game computers, recreational robots. - How do you pull his plug? - I'm the president. - He's the president. - Dude, I got it here. - Sorry. - Yeah see, this is the new football game we just put out. - Bought one for my kid brother, didn't work. - Did you buy batteries? It helps. Come on guys, drop me off at the Four Seasons in 10 minutes, I'll tie the deal up. I think we'll have a few drinks, talk about it, huh? - I've got more important things to do, Mr. Sloane. - I wasn't even talking to you. - She's not your type. - He's right. - Well how do you know, huh? Were you a father? - She's more the Carey Grant or Clark Gable-type. - What do you think he is? Liver chops? - It's chopped liver, you. - Look Mr Sloane, I don't talk to you, you don't talk to me, deal? - You got it, sweetheart. - Enough chatter, we're almost there. Who's gonna pay? - Not me. - Hey, it's her cab. - Oh gentlemen, gentlemen. - All right, we blew the deal. I stalled them for about three hours and they walked. I worked on that deal for about six months. I don't know any other lawyer that would've-- - Hey, let it go, let it go, they'll come back, huh? - [Harrison] All right but the Birchwood Trust-- - I don't wanna hear about the Birchwood Trust, okay? Besides, I'm makin' money, remember? Anyway, I've got a clear mandate to do whatever I want with Leisure 80. - Within reason, Sloane, within reason. You ever heard of hubris? - Hubris? Oh Hobris, didn't I go to his bar mitzvah last week? - A Greek word Sloane, it means arrogance, putting yourself above the gods. - [Woman] Miss, your cab has arrived now. - Car ready, Ramone? - [Raoul and Sloane] Raoul. - Gesundheit. - Hey listen, I'm sorry. Why don't you let me buy you some champagne? - Why don't you go dry out somewhere? - Well I said I'm sorry. - [Dee] Walter made me feel so small, like a kid who's forgotten their homework for the 10th time. - Well I know one thing, you've gotta stand up for yourself in this business. - I'm telling you Kit, that wasn't your fault. - [Kit] Well I don't know. - Hi, hey, is this your friend Kit you told me about? - Uh huh. - Great, are you coming to the movies with us tonight too? - Movies? - Oh honey, I'm sorry, I completely forgot about our plans. I can't make it now, I've got night school. Listen now, next week, okay? I promise. - Okay, I gotta run now, my mom's waiting downstairs for me. Nice meeting you, Kit. - You too, Topsy. - Bye, Dee. - Bye. - So cute. - Sorry dear, five foot five just doesn't make it. Choose a new career, next. - You're all heart, Iris. - Oh I know. - You bitch. You ingrate, you somnambulistic slab. - Eva, I don't care what you say. - Darling. - Let me be, Walter. I'll let the world know about you, you loathsome luntz from lap land. Go on then, see what that French pimp can do for you. - Zara honey, eat anybody I know lately? - [Zara] Minnie [speaking foreign language]. - Minnie what? [claps] - I'm really sorry Eva, I tried to explain to Walter but he-- - Walter, that miscreant, I've never hated anyone as much as Dominique Shariet, that little snake. Why, I got him his green card answering my phone and he's systematically stolen every girl from this agency. - Well we'll never leave ya. - That's sweet of you to say, Dee. But I'm afraid that models have the enduring loyalty of flashbulbs. Not that I can blame you. Ours is a brief season. There's a first show at Bloomies tomorrow. - It's a job. - A job? Oh hell, Eva, she deserves another spread. Now that Zara's down the tubes, why don't you give her one of Zara's covers? - Dee, how can you talk like this? Zara's body isn't even cold yet. Let me finish trashing her first. Then we can talk business. [electronic beeping] - [Sloane] I've been giving Harrison a hard time lately, I figured I should make it up to you. - Harrison gives himself a hard time. That doesn't mean you have to double date with him and his preppy wife. - Come on man, she's not that bad. She just didn't have the advantages we had growin' up in the slums. - [Craig] Well I prefer to think of it as fashionably broke. - What about your date? Her name must be Muffy. - Actually, it's Bunny. - Bunny? - Yeah. - Birchwood. - As in the Birchwood Trust? - You got it pal, the granddaughter of-- - Well Lordy Lordy, Master Sloane gonna save the farm by marrying the banker's daughter. - 86 Cairo, huh? Can't hurt to stay in tight with Owen Birchwood, you never know when we're gonna have to hit him for another big loan. That's her. - Who her? - The girl I accidented. Who is she? - [Craig] I don't know, a model. - I'm telling you man, there's magic there. You find out everything about her, okay? - First thing in the morning. - No, tonight. That's your homework. - [Kit] Hey maybe I could wear this to your auction tonight. - [Tessa] It'd be a big hit. - Another gift from Chester? - That's my beauty mask. - [Kit] Where is your ambassador these days? - Oh Kuala Lumpur, I keep getting these strange messages from foreign operators asking me to hold on and they never come back. - Wish I could find a guy like that. - You have terrific taste. - [Kit] Would you ever marry him? - If I marry anyone, it will definitely be him. And besides, I'm ready to have some kids run around the house but it does make it tough to jump off to Kashmir or Bali. You look great. - Thanks Tessa. [knocking] Hi, Mr O'Rourke? - Monseigneur O'Rourke. - Oh, of course, Father. - Come in, sister. - Now then, the real treasure of the evening. A vase from the Ming period obtained from the estate of the late Gladys Filliping. - What, what happened? - The Ming. Doesn't it just send chills up and down your spine? Absolutely top drawer, don't you think? - Oh it's absolutely top drawer. - [Auctioneer] Let's open the bidding at $50,000. Do I hear 50,000? I have $50,000. - Excuse me, do you know where the lady's room is? - [Dee] Oh, oh, oh Father, oh. [moaning] - I can't breathe. - Oh my. [gasping] Hey, oh, oh. Oh. - Listen, I spoke with Jacques this afternoon. - Shh, Bunny, not here. - He promised-- Why? - I want you to work on Sloane. - Must I? - Mm hmm. - Hello Cairo, you've gotta get me outta here, you should hear this broad. Top drawer this, top drawer that. I'm out with the bloody bureau. [knob rattling] Hold on a second. - [Kit] Help, excuse me, help. - Listen, I'll call you back, all right? - [Kit] Hello, excuse me, is someone out there, hello? Excuse me, help, is someone out there? - Looks like a different house. Hello, were you talking to me? - [Kit] Anyone, I'm afraid I'm trapped in here, I can't get the door open. - What is it, locked? - [Kit] I don't know, I think it's stuck or something. - Well I don't know, it wasn't locked for me. [laughing] You're a real hard luck case, aren't you? How come you couldn't open the door? - Come in here. - Sure, I'll try anything once. - All right genius, open it. [rattling] - [Sloane] Shit. - Did I do something bad in another life? Out of nine zillion people, I get stuck, trapped, locked in a miniature bathroom with T.C. Sloane. - Not him again. - Yeah, what happened? - I forgot when you put a lot of bubble bath with the jacuzzi, it gets kinda crazy. - Dee, you wouldn't believe this guy. For an hour, I was stuck in there for an hour with that arrogant, conceited, obnoxious-- - [Dee] I've never seen you this riled up over a guy. - I'm calm, wanna know why? 'Cause I've got a lock of his hair and I'm gonna make a voodoo doll and stick little pins into his body. - Stop it, you are not. - No, then I'm never gonna see him again. Oh please God, please, if you can hear me, don't let me see him again, please. - It's all right, God hears ya. [laughing] - Kit used to be the Kringelein Carpet Girl back in LA. - The what? Klaus Kringelein is the Carpet King of Southern California. Kit used to do his commercials for him. Then he fell in love with her, wanted to make her a big star. She freaked and ran away to New York. - This guy Kringelein was no fool. I've been out with some of the most beautiful girls in the world and I'm telling you this girl, she's somethin' extra. - Thanks a lot, T.C. - Oh, no offense taken. Osbourne, shake a leg, come on, time for a little shan't. - [Ozzie] Sorry Mr T.C. but I have no legs to shake. It is noteworthy that champagne is best served at a temperature of 45 degrees Fahrenheit or seven degrees Celsius and is best consumed immediately upon pouring. - I'm telling you, Kit Paget is gonna be a superstar. - When are you taking her over, general? She's a devoted member of Eva Randall's court, she wouldn't make a move without their blessing. - Now don't you drop anything. What's their story? - He's into orchids and she dances on the wrong side of the ballroom. Between the two of them, they've managed to flush that whole agency right down the toilet. - Oh yeah? Oh, well maybe we can help them out. We buy in to manage Kit 100% and we take it slow. I don't wanna scare her away with any of your crazy stunts, huh? - I don't know, Eva's a pretty tough nut to crack and she's cracked a lot of nuts. [laughing] - Listen, you go and feel her out tomorrow and then we send in Harrison for the kill, huh? Come here. You missed Gary's run-in, Jesus Christ. [classical violin music] - [Joel] Good, good. Look at me again, good. Show me some leg. Come on girls, you're getting paid for this. Gimme some of that profile. Good, gimme green Kitty, gimme a profile, green. That a girl, good, good. Good. Green, give me profile. Good, get away. Touch your earrings, you've got beautiful earrings, touch 'em, that a girl. - Listen Eva, you're in trouble and everyone in town knows it. - Really? I wasn't aware. - Come on babe, Sloane's ready to sink a fortune into this girl. Promote her, spread my genius on her. - God help us all. - Hey, wait a minute. - [Joel] Easy on the fog guys, I'm shooting ladies, not fog, for Christ's sake. Good, good, good. Touch your earrings sweetheart. Touch your earrings, that a girl. Gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous. Look at me goldie, look at me, right into the camera, that a girl, good. - [Craig] So, what do I tell Sloane? - Why is he so interested in her? - He feels badly about her blowin' the Cosmo gig, he wasn't to make it up to her. A million dollar apology? Sounds fishy to me, Blitzstein. Sloane's a businessman. - And modeling isn't a business? What did you agency gross last year? Better yet, what did Lauren Hutton and Cheryl Tiegs make? What did Zara make? Sorry. - And now, Kit is going to show us a breathtaking item that will turn any man's head on those long winter nights. [clapping] - How are ya? Hey, how much is the coat? - The prices are all marked on the programs, sir. - Oh, okay, I'll buy it, what else you got? - Sonya, will you please have Zara come out in-- - Oh, I'd like to see her again. - But sir, we don't usually-- - Her. - Get the coat off her. - Hey, what is the meaning of this, huh? - Zara, Zara. - Zara, Zara. [speaking foreign language] - Now I'm afraid Mr Sloane would wrap my knuckles if he knew the generosity of my offer to you, it far exceeds what he suggested. - [Eva] Well I think that-- - Let's stopped this charade, Eva. We're in trouble and Mr Chandler knows it. Maybe this is what we need. Some real administration. May I see the contract? - Why not? [clapping] [whistling] - So, are you gonna buy this one too? - How much is it? - 14-five. - Okay, I'll buy it. Put it on the tab. [laughing] - All right. What else is next? - I wish they'd told us this was gonna be a one woman show. - It wasn't my idea. - Well girls, at least we still get paid. - Why does he want all these coats? - Beats me. - It is obviously the model he's buying, not the coats. - You're sweet. - So for a cash amount and 5% of Leisure 80 enterprises. - We will take 50% of the agency and the management of Miss Paget's career. - [Walter] Why is Kit so important to this deal? Her earnings are far from staggering. - Well we feel that we can bring a different thrust to her career. - And what is this continuity of management clause? - Should Mr. Sloane leave Leisure 80, this guarantees that his successor will continue to guide Miss Paget's career. - And is Mr. Sloane likely to leave in the near future? - You never know, one day you're in, one day you're out. [laughing] - Oh, look at her. [applauding] - For 40,000. - Wrap it up. - That's it. - I beg your pardon? - We're out of coats. - Oh. Well, ladies, that concludes the most extraordinary show of my career. [audience applauding] - I hope you know what you're doing. - You startin' with that Hoover shit again, huh? Thanks, huh? - Wild Turkey, sir? - Thank you, Raoul. Raoul, go. Oh yoo hoo, oh hello there. - You're crazy, you know that? - Yeah, I know, you hungry? - Starving. - Terrific. I know a great little place for dinner. You're gonna love it. Well come on, you only got four hours to get ready. Step right in. I knew you'd see it my way. Okay Raoul, let's get in the wind. [upbeat ensemble violin music] [fireworks booming] [laughing] Anyway, they hadn't any gross market yet. So I figured we got a really good shot at it. The very next day I'm steered over to Harrison Chandler and he takes me over to the Birchwood Trust. The rest is history. - Where do I fit in? - You're my new challenge. I'm gonna make you a star. - My name in lights, showtime. Are you prepared to put that in writing? [laughs] Oh my god. - Deal? - Deal. - Deal. [relaxed violin music] - What do you do for an encore? - Come on. [fingers snapping] [fireworks booming] [fireworks whistling] [relaxed ensemble music] [doorbell ringing] - Raoul. - Good morning. - What's all this? I don't believe this. For me? - Mm hmm. - Oh god. - Oh my god, what's happening? It's not my birthday, is it? This is too much. They're not for me. - Oh no. - Look, I don't have any time to talk but I just want you to know I'm launching you today. When I put this deal through, your face is gonna be everywhere. It's gonna be on TV, magazines, billboards, holograms. You're gonna be an institution. Every girl in America's gonna be dressed like you, gonna look like you, want to be you. Yeah, won't you gimme some luck? - Luck. - Come over here. - Oh god. - I'm leaving. - [Kit] Oh god. - Somebody help that girl up. ♪ Hold the line, say it ♪ Say you love me again ♪ Say it, say you love me again ♪ ♪ I don't know just what to do ♪ I wanna spend all my time with you ♪ ♪ With you ♪ Every day and every night ♪ I love you more than I ever thought I might ♪ ♪ I might - Well well well, don't tell me you've come back into the fold again. - Ha, I spit on Eva Randall. I am only here because Delvin begs me to come. As for you, you cost me a lot of money today, Kit. You can send me a check in the mail. - How about a plastic surgeon? - Hey Zara. So you left Cherrier already. You're even smarter than I thought you were. [speaking foreign language] Delvis, Delvis darling. [smooching] How wonderful. - Time to meet the press, Delvis. - Excuse me. - Hey Del, you know it's too bad you didn't use Kit for your cover, hmm? What a face, such a bundle of [smooching]. - You will excuse me. - Oh, sure. Juice. - Not now. - Now, come on. You listen to Geppetto. You don't do what I tell you, you won't go too far. [guests applauding] - Are you two an item, Mr. Sloane? - I'd like you to meet Kit Paget. Now you be nice to her 'cause a month from now, you won't be able to get near her. - Oh, she's gonna be that big? - The biggest. Right, Eva? - Absolutely. - Sloane. - And she's modest too, oh, you gotta love her. Good stuff, pal. - I drink the air before me. - [Sloane] Well drink it faster. [upbeat jazzy ensemble music] - Whatever you've done, I want it first. - Joyce-y. - Got any good dirt? - Me, innocent little me? - Can I just talk to you for a second? - Talk. - Couldn't we go somewhere a little more appealing? I mean this-- - I got a thing for oysters. - Yeah well, I remember. Well look, I've been spending a lot of time thinking about us and I just want you to know that I've changed. - What are you laying the strip on me for? We had a fling, no big deal, it's over. - Joel, I am not the sort of person who can just in and out of love that easily. - Hi, Topsy. - Hi. - Where's Dee? - I don't know. - Didn't you go to the movies with her tonight? - No, I thought she was with you. - Oh. - You're making such a mistake. - You know, you really are nuts. I'm gone, sweetheart, I fuckin' vanished, wake up. - Don't do that to me. - Where have you been, I thought that... Who's that? - Last year's model. - Avril. What happened? - Wow. - Nicky, how fast can you get down and get a tight two-shot of those two girls before they split and back up to me? Get going. Blitzstein, you're a bloody wonder. - Why do you keep doing this? You're humiliating yourself, don't you realize? - Okay, I think I just wanna go. - Get outta here. - Let's just go. - Walter, darling. Is that boy one of yours? - Come on Av, let's go home. - Go ahead, I'm just going to tell Sloane. [upbeat electronic music] Sloane. - Yeah, over here. I have to l-- - I've been looking for you all night. We haven't toasted each other since last night, to you. - Hey, big time Sloane, you wanna make me a superstar too? - Do you mind? I'm talking to my client right now. - Is that what you call 'em these days? Come on, dance with me in the fountain. It's good luck, like throwing pennies. - [Sloane] I'm gonna wear my shirt dry tonight, huh? - Chicken. - Pretty-- [woman screaming] [laughing] Unique, huh? That's a pretty crazy chick. Dance it up girl, go ahead, take it off. This is... - Hell yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That is it, nail 'em, nail 'em now. - What are you up to, you naughty boy? - Just the biggest scoop of the year and you're gonna get it exclusive. Oh Cocky, Cocky, Cocky. - Move along. - What's wrong? I thought we were having a good time. - You're having a good time promoting your new toy. I'm not one of your robots, Sloane. - Hey, let's talk about this at my place, huh? - I don't wanna go to your place. - Yeah but after last night, I kinda thought that we were-- - What, is it like insulin, you need it every night? - Hey lady, I'm crazy about you. - All right, there is an attraction but Avril needs me tonight and I have a session in the morning. - Yeah, but I kinda-- - In the words of the Master, it's 86'd for tonight, Sloane. - Well I just kinda thought that, you know, I-- [door slams] [relaxed violin, flute music] - [Tessa] I understand what you're saying but listen kiddo, wake up, he's like all the other revolving doors you keep going around with. - No, he's different, really and as soon as I get myself back in shape, he'll be back, you'll see. - [Tessa] Yeah, him and Nixon. - Look Tessa, you don't understand. You don't know Joel the way I do. You don't know what we had planned together. - I only know you're hurting and it's not worth it. - Joel is a very successful photographer. I mean he's extremely busy right now. He doesn't have much free time, I can handle that. Look, Tess, he's the first guy that really loved me. - Listen, I know Vacchio. Maybe you love him but he's got a light meter where his heart's supposed to be. - Please. - No. - Tessa, I need them. - No! Look, maybe you should get away for awhile. Come away to my family's place for the weekend. - No, I don't think I wanna go, thanks. I think I wanna be home right now, okay? - [Tessa] Yeah, fine. [soft electronic, violin music] - From now on, Kit's gonna be seen at only the best spots 'cause I want all New York to see how beautiful you are tonight and starting this week, I have your whole future mapped out. Acting classes, dance classes, boys classes. - I take classes now. - With who? I'm talking about the best. Do you know what trouble it took to get this guy? I mean the man does not teach private students. - Oh, well that's a great reason to go. - Taekwondo? - Yeah, those crowds are murder. Right, Blitzstein? - The man's on a hot roll, don't cool his dice. You know how you succeed in this town? You plug into your best fantasy or your worst paranoia. This is his fantasy and he's loving it. - Good evening, Mr. Cockridge. A pleasure to see you again. - There's Cocky. - Who? - Alton Cockridge, the designer. I haven't seen him since I modeled his fall collection. - Oh, I'd kill to model his clothes. - You will baby, believe me, if I have my way, you will. Did you tell her yet? - Would I steal your thunder? - Tell me what? - I had Joel Vacchio do test shots of you for a layout. He's the best in the business, you know. - Great timing, Sloane. - What, was it something I said? - Great. - Well, I hope you're enjoying my table. - What? Oh well hi there, did you make it? Hey, nice job. You know I need some shells put in if you got the time, huh? - Oh, the dreaded Blitzstein. Now I understand this rather strange collection. - You don't look too bad on the glass yourself, pal. - The butch voice that speaks the vacant mind. - Sloane, don't. - Come Tali, we promised these ladies a civilized meal. - That's the guy you wanted to work for? - He's a genius. - What a brave new world you've led us into, Sloane. [alarm clock ringing] - Come on, time to get up. - Let me get some more sleep. - No time, we got a busy day. Get up! Come on, come on, come on my sweets, move your feets. A little road burn never hurt anyone. Come on, we gotta get you in shape. Pick 'em up, pick 'em up, pick 'em up, pick 'em up. Come on, pick 'em up, you can do it, you can do it, baby. That's right, stretch 'em out, stretch it. Come on sweetheart, come on, come on. Just one more time around the lake and you've got it. We're gonna make you, baby. Come on, come on.

All right, all right, great. More, more, more. Another one, another one, come on, come on. - Please get in the car. - [Photographer] Look here, come on, get a new one. - Don't get in the car. - [Photographer] All right, one more, one more. - [Reporter] Open the window please. Get to the window. - [Photographer] Come on, a couple more, a couple more. Come on, one more, come on. - You know, you look like an unidentified flying object. - Wait until Sloane has me in bed with this. - Great. Smile. Smile. Gimme a profile, now look at me with your eyes. Smile at me, no, smile with your whole face. Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah. [camera clicking] Great. Look at me. Gimme a profile, gimme a profile.

Hey, the camera loves you, now love the camera a bit, huh? Cut the water. Make my lens wet baby, open up wide, I'm comin' in big. Okay baby, let's do something here. You do it for Sloane, how about me, huh? - Okay Joel, sit on that lens and rotate 'cause that's as close as you're coming to me. - All right folks, that's a wrap. - [Sloane] Hey speedo, will you get this thing outta reverse? Use the sidewalk or something, she hates it when I'm late. Don't look at me like that, turn around. - [Joel] What's the matter, did I scare you? It's just I saw the way you were looking at me during the shoot. - The way I was looking at you? - Hey, you're hot for me and I'm hot for you. - I don't know what Avril ever saw in you but-- - [Joel] Yeah, she could never get enough. - Joel. - She got old after awhile. - You're sick. Joel, let me go! God, Joel! [grunting] Where the hell is everybody? - That wasn't very nice of you. I'm not used to my girls treating me like this. - I'm not one of your girls. [tense violin music] - [Joel] Yeah but you wanna be one of my girls, don't ya? Huh? Don't ya? [slapping] - I hate you. [doorbell ringing] Joel, you asshole. I hate... - [Joel] You stop. - No. Joel. [banging] Ow. Help! [Kit screaming] - Joel, you slimy fuck. [thudding] [grunting] I'll kill you, you bastard. You like that, huh? You like that. That's right, that's right, yes. Listen, you gotta leave it behind, you have to. You know, such good things are gonna happen for you. Oh, I know it. - I'm scared. - It's Timothy Clifford. - What is? - [Sloane] T.C., my initials. - Can I call you Tim? - Not if you wanna live. - Why, it's a nice name. - Because it was my father's name and he was a son of a bitch. - How about Clifford, Cliff? Cliffy. [laughing] - Forget you know it. [robot beeping] - [Ozzie] Ahem, ahem, excuse me Mr. T.C., your coffee is ready. - No. - Cream or sugar? - I have a daughter that I've never seen. - Cream or sugar. - Shut up. - How old? - She's eight by now. Her mother got remarried and I didn't want to stick my nose in. Her mother didn't want me to, so I gave up trying. - You gave up, I can't believe that one. - What are you, a social worker or something tonight? - Why, am I not allowed? Hello, Sloane residence. Oh I'm sorry, he's unavailable until late tomorrow morning. - Oh, you. [vacuum humming] - [Ozzie] Beep, beep, beep. Beep, beep, beep. Move it or lose it. Thank you. - Good morning. - Oh hi, I'm Kit. - I'm Desi. - How you doing, Desi? - Poorly, poorly. My feet hurt something awful. Do you want some coffee? - Oh, love it. - Me too, why don't you make us some? [Desi giggling] - Sure. - The beautiful people, our own Joyce Gorman. - [Joyce] Thanks Tom, well the Big Apple has certainly been shaken-- - Thank you, Ozzie. - To its core this morning. Love has found Cocky at last. - How do you like your coffee, Desi? - Got any cognac? [Desi giggles] - World famous designer and an elusive bachelor has been carrying on a secret romance with fashion model Kit Paget. That's Cocky and Kit exchanging a tender moment together at Delpha's-- - Sloane. - Launching and the big news is that Miss Paget is going to have Cocky's baby. - Sloane. [robot beeping] - Uh-oh. - You sure do get around. - Best known to Los Angeles viewers as the Kringelein Carpet Girl, says she has kept the secret as long as possible. When interviewed at our Burbank studio last night, her former mentor Klaus Kringelein had this to say. - That's all I need. - Listen, we never sold so many carpets like when she was here and if she can do the same for Mr. Cock-roach, believe me, they'll have lots more little babies. - National Enquirer. [Desi laughing] - My favorite people. - They'll be happy. - And it's just like the Mardi Gras around here. - I'm selling the little baby such a cute little carpet with the rabbits-- - Hey listen. - And the bunnies and the little flowers. I know they'll love it. - Go to court for harassment. [Desi giggling] - [Ozzie] Good evening. Oh, it's my pleasure. - Craig did it? - [Eva] Is this your idea of management? - [Sloane] Jeez, I'll talk to you later. - Cleaning personnel, why have you seen the papers? - [Desi] You are on the television. - Yes ma'am, I'm in the television. Look at this coverage, will ya? It's better than I hoped for. You are launched, carpet queen. - You did this. - Your obedient servant. - Craig, have you lost your mind? - What's wrong? She wanted dignity, she wanted class. Cockridge is like royalty. [phone ringing] He's like the Queen, he is a Queen. [Desi laughing] - All right, now where the hell you get off doing something like that? - Hey, that's my job, you've always given me carte blanche. You know, it's amazing what you can do with two photographs. What I figure is we'll wait a few more days-- - [Kit] I'm not waiting, okay, you're both insane. - Woo. [Desi giggling] - [Kit] Enough! - All right listen, I want you to get on the phone and I want you to straighten this thing out right now, all right? You tell 'em it was April fools, you tell 'em-- - Hey. - What the hell you want, Desi? - I didn't get no coffee. - [Sloane] Who do I look like, Juan Valdez? Nobody did. - I never should have made this deal. Walter pushed me into it. - [Craig] Hello, can I speak to the city desk? - Have I got this on right or does it match my head? - Here. Look, I'll break the contract if that's what you want. - I don't know what I want but right now I wanna get outta here. - Okay. Okay. - [Weatherman] And there are plenty of dark, heavy clouds on the horizon. - Be sure not to burn your toes. - I don't know what Kit's plans are but I am divorcing myself from this association. I did not build up a prestige agency in order to have it turn into the laughing stock of New York overnight. - There's no sugar? - You didn't ask for any sugar? Oh Kit, come on, don't leave, huh? - Why shouldn't I? You never told me I'd be joining a freak show. - [Weatherman] 80% tomorrow and 90% tomorrow night. - Ozzie, sugar. - [Ozzie] Sugar, coming right up. [Desi laughing] - [Weatherman] 29.7 inches and falling-- - [Sloane] What are you, a hyena? [playful electronic carnival music] - Miss Paget, I'm here. All right. How did you find out? - I don't understand-- - Don't play games with me, Miss Paget. I've kept this secret for years, I don't need it blown now. - Mr. Cockridge, I am as upset as you are by all these ugly al-- - Do you realize what would happen to me if certain men in this city, I mean rich, powerful men knew I was a fraud? They'd find me in the East River wearing pink cement galoshes. I've already paid for two abortions. - Abortions? - A common practice for unwanted babies, are you, you're really pregnant? I've never seen so many balls in my life. - [Kit] I don't get it. - I am supposed to be harmless. I'm queer old Cocky, dear. There isn't a man in New York who wouldn't trust me with his wife. - You're a closet heterosexual? - Shh. [Kit chuckling] I'm a fucking stud, you see, I'm ruined. You're about to flush 15 years of work down the toilet. [Cockridge laughing] It's crazy, isn't it? - Classic Craig Blitzstein. - Huh? The dreaded Craig Blitzstein, well I might have known it. Well my dear, what do you want out of all this? - Nothing, I want the story killed, same as you. - [Cockridge] That's all? No strings? - I'll carry your secret to the grave, cross my heart. - And hope to die? - No. [laughs] - I'm in trouble, Sloane, I need your help. Cherrier has just stolen another three girls. - What do you want me to do, put a contract out on him? - We'd like you to buy back our 5% of Leisure 80. - What 5%? - That you gave us in exchange for your share of the agency. - We're prepared to let you have it for 100,000 in cash. We know it's worth a great deal more but-- - Wait, what do you mean Harrison gave you 5%? Now why did he do that? He must've had a good reason, talk to him, huh? [relaxed synthesized music] - So Kit, Sloane is now your sugar daddy, huh? Some girls have all the luck. - Don't listen to her, Kit, at least you've got what you got. Stand tough. - And what does that mean? - Oh Zara honey, you know, I would just hate to cast any aspersions on your honor. You know, they wouldn't have you on a stop herpes poster. - People in glass houses. - Mm hmm, come again? I didn't quite catch it. - At least I don't do it for the money. [women gasping] - [Kit] Avril. Come on, ladies. - Shit. - Avril. - Where's her phone? - I don't know. Are you all right, hon? - I don't know. - Get back. - What happened? Get a doctor. - Here, give her a toot. - Are you-- [clattering] You're crazy! [Zara speaking foreign language] - Do you understand that Cockridge publicity stunt of yours really freaked me out, Sloane? - I mean what the hell, Blitzstein covered, huh? You gotta admit it was kinda funny. - Oh, it's all a riot if you're not the object of ridicule. - You got a beef? - Yeah, I don't want to be handled like this anymore. I feel like a joke. - I just sank five million bucks into a factory. I'll be laughing myself into bankruptcy. - Well I'm not laughing. Right now there's nothing to laugh about. I just saw Avril taken to the hospital. She's cracking up over that maniac that tried to rape me. - Listen, Harrison says we can't start a line without a name designer. - So? - So, so, so, they all have their own lines already. Calvin Klein, Alston, Oscar the poo poo bird. - What about Cocky? - Cockridge, are you kidding me? There's that night at Le Toille, huh? Blitzstein's brain wave. - I can get him. - This kinda reminds me of a salad I had once. Okay, all right, all right. - Alton will be up in just a moment. One teaspoon or two? - What? - Your tea. - Oh. One. - [Teddy] You're going to love the designs. - Oh yeah, that's great. - It's all right Teddy, we're not buying him, you don't have to count his teeth. Hello child, how are you? - [Kit] Great, how are you? - Hemorrhoidal. Do you want to see some pretty pictures? - Yes. - Come on. - Hello. - Hello. Voila. - Wow. It's very nice. - I love it, I love it, they're wonderful. Look at this. - That's really nice. - Yeah, it's gorgeous. They're wonderful. I was thinking of calling it Kit Paget's Pageant but I was afraid it might induce harelips. [chuckling] So I pinched your notion, Mr. Sloane, Dreamworld. - Great. - Oh, I love it. To Dreamworld. - To Dreamworld. - Dreamworld. [loud buzzing] What the hell is this? - I thought it was for me. - Sloane. [Desi laughing] What's with Fort Knox in the kitchen? I'm hungry. - You ate lunch, you don't eat 'til dinner. I'm counting every calorie. Your body is a major asset. - [Ozzie] Some carrot cake from Pierre's Bakery. - Oh, Ozzie. [electronic beeping] Desi. - Leisure 80 sales have hit an all time high for the past quarter. - All right, excellent. Would you have some copies prepared for the annual shareholders meeting please, Cariyoo? - Cairo, oh yes, yes, of course. - Hey when is that, huh? - Next week, Mr. Birchwood by the way is thrilled with our success. - We all did it guys, huh? And Kit. Hey, wake up. I'm sorry all the success is putting you to sleep. - What time is it? - It's 6:30. - I've gotta get to the hospital. - Hold on, we got a meeting with the people from Bullocks, remember? - I haven't seen Avril in weeks, I promised Dee. - You're gonna have to change it. We're on a hot roll, you can't let your personal life interfere. - Excuse me, God, but my friends still come first in my life. - That's not the way I see it. - Then you better get some glasses, pal. - Am I too late? - Yeah, visiting hours are over. - Oh shit. - Wow, you look so different. I can't believe it's you. - Where have you been? We haven't heard a word from you. - You haven't let it go to your head, have you? - What the hell does that mean? - I heard someone say that at the agency. - You don't believe that, do you? - When was the last time that you took one minute to give any of us a call? - What's with this shit? I thought you were my friends. - Come on, Topsy. [soft somber electronic music] - You look terrible. - Thanks, that's just what I need to hear. - Well if you'd made the meeting, you would've been in bed by 10:00 but no, not you. - This show goes out live, so if you've got anything to say to one another, you'd best do it in the next few seconds. - [Director] Quiet studio, roll camera. Five, four, three, two, one. - Kit Paget, the Dreamworld girl, the face of the 80s. T.C. Sloane, entrepreneur, hustler extraordinaire and some say the Svengali behind Kit Paget. Kit, what is it really like? I mean what is it really like to have your image plastered all over the world? - It sucks. [Sloane laughs nervously] - Kit uses these funny little phrases sometimes. What I think she means by that-- - I don't need an interpreter. - Let's not come to blows on the air, now then-- - Hold it a second, Claire. I think Kit owes you and the audience an apology. She's not up to scratch this morning. - Oh, you're completely out of your tree, do you know that? You're on such an ego trip. Just once I'm gonna say what I think, just once. If I only had two seconds to myself, if I had some privacy. Even when I'm trying to take a-- - Would you shut up? - A nap, Sloane, that's all I meant. I respect your privacy. You don't want anybody to know what your real name is. You want to know what his real name is? It's Timothy-- [Sloane screaming] - [Director] Cut. - What is wrong with you? - Come on, come on. - It's under control. [slap] - [Kit] Claire. - Oh, great. - Get outta here, I'll get her. - Roll the commercial. - Come on, Kit. - Are you all right, Miss? - I'll take care of it. - Roll the commercial. Fade out, roll the commercial. - Miss Claire? - Jesus. [relaxed violin, synthesized music] [clock ticking] [weeping] - I heard your crying and I thought-- - Just leave me alone, will ya? - Where have you been? - I took Topsy to a film and then-- - No, you didn't, I called Topsy tonight at her mother's. She never-- - What? Have you been spying on me? - My god Dee, what happened to you? - Nothing. - Who did this to you? - A trick. - Your phone. Why Dee, why? - I get my kicks this way. - Getting beat up? - No, that's never happened before. Look, I was sick. - How long have you been-- - What? A prostitute, a whore? About a year now. - Have you seen a psychiatrist? - Yeah. Yeah, I seen one once. He fucked me in his office. [soft electronic music] [Ozzie beeping] - [Ozzie] Wild Turkey on the rocks, sir. - Yeah. Just what the doctor ordered. Keep this up, I'll buy you a wig. - I have been so bored in here. - I would've come sooner, Av. I'm sorry I didn't, I really am. Things have been so crazy lately. - Don't be silly, you're on top now. Look, I'm really happy for you, Kit. I should be so lucky. I'll admit I was a little jealous at first but that's just because you and Sloane were doing exactly what Joel and I had planned. I guess I just didn't have what it takes. - Hey sexy, you better rest up before you start chasing around again, okay? - Look, I'm feeling much stronger now, really. Kit, if you see Joel, will you just thank him for the flowers? - Sleep. I'll be back soon, I promise this time. [loud chattering] - What was her name again? - You gave her her first job. - It was a pittance. [upbeat jazzy ensemble music] - [Zara] Happy birthday, little one. Zara has a special gift for you. - I don't think I should. - Oh go on, it will make you feel good. You're a big girl now, hmm? - But what if someone comes in? My mom would kill me. - No one will come now. - Oh, he's wonderful. [laughing] - Now [sniffling]. [sniffling] Harder, huh? Topsy. Sniff in. Why don't you mind your own business, you Texas tramp? [Zara screams] [splashing] - Now listen, you get downstairs and I never wanna catch you doing that again. - I'm sorry but she made me. - Get outta here. [Zara shouting in foreign language] Ow. - Nein. - [Dee] You're really pissing me off, Zara. - [Zara] Then it's a fight. I'm sick of you. [shouting] [Zara screaming, speaking foreign language] - Zara. - [Dee] Shut up. [screaming] - Party upstairs, let's go. - Tess. - Zara. - I had to tell you my news. I've managed to get almost all the proxies on our side. - Excellent. When will you have the rest? - Harrison Agonistes Chandler. You know sometimes I think all you care about is getting rid of Sloane. You'll have Leisure 80. I promise you. - Top drawer. [pouty giggling] [people shouting] - [Craig] Everybody cool it. - Dee! - No don't, get me out. No, don't. Take me to Sloane. - Leave her alone, you creep. [shouting] - And they call it the Miles Moore. - Nobody's perfect, baby. - Well I'm not finished yet. - [Cairo] Hey, don't-- - Eva? Eva, where are you? - Oh Walter, must you always spoil my fun? - I just thought you'd want to know that Avril killed herself. [gasping] [soft somber electronic music] - Can we get on with this? - Sorry we're late. - It's all right, Sloane. I declare the annual shareholder's meeting of the Birchwood Trust now open. I'd like to make a priority motion before you read the minutes. - What the hell is she doing here? - On behalf of the majority shareholders in Leisure 80 Enterprises, we would at this time request the immediate resignation of T.C. Sloane. - Just 'cause I was a lousy date? - And that the Presidency be immediately assumed by Harrison Chandler. - Oh. Now I know what was going on in that top drawer. You're outta line Bunny, you know you don't have the votes. - Well I have Birchwood Trust properties with me totalling 50% of the ownership. - I have 45%, Kyle has two and a half, Blitzstein has two and a half, that makes 50. So it's a stalemate. - You only have 45%, not 50. Did you forget Eva Randall's 5%? And I have proxies for them here which gives us 55%. - You son of a bitch. That's why you gave them the 5%, huh? - Do you remember what I said about hubris, Sloane? The barbarians are at the gate. [phone ringing] - Now listen Harrison, I just wanna-- - Kit, I am so pleased to see you. Sit down? No? Look, I just want you to know the change of management-- - You can't get rid of Sloane, he is Leisure 80 and Dreamworld. - Not anymore, he's out. - Out. - Well so am I. If you don't bring Sloane back, I'm gone, understand? - Fine, fine, I accept your resignation. Miss Birchwood here is a witness. We'll just have to conduct a search for a new Dreamworld girl which should be worth about a million dollars in free publicity. [smug giggling] Oh T.C., would you come here please, T.C.? - [T.C.] Coming, Mr. Chandler. I have two screwdrivers, tall with a dash of grenadine. [humming] As requested. - Thank you, T.C. - [T.C.] Thank you, Mr. Chandler. [electronic beeping] - Oh and by the way Kim, sorry, Kit, you do realize that your contract prevents you from seeking employment elsewhere for 18 months. You know I think that you should get some rest. All this has been very grueling for you. [chuckling] T.C., you can go now, thank you. - That son of a bitch Harrison wants to play dirty, he doesn't know what dirty is. - But how can we-- - Listen, I've got it all worked out. We're gonna play his game. The first thing we're gonna do is call a new board meeting. Now didn't you tell me that Lucius Cathcart was Chester's cousin? - Why, you clever little-- - I want you to get Chester on the phone right away. - [Dee] But he's in Swaziland, it's almost-- - Just get him on the phone. - No operator, Swaziland. - You think they're done? - Would you come on, Betty Crocker. - [Craig] It's a hop hop over, my love. - Now Dee, I want you to get the goods on Harrison. - Okay, I don't know a damn thing about business. - This kind of business is second nature, honey. - Chester, darling, I know it's the middle of the night but I need you to call Lucius Cathcart. - I'm not leaving until I have those proxies. Hold the calls. - [Walter] We've released them to Harrison Chandler. - You'll reassign them right now or I'll pull down the pillars of this agency. You've got enough trouble with Dominique's raids. How would you feel if Tessa, Dee and I walked out? - Get the Leisure 80 papers, Walter, please. My my, we're a big girl now, aren't we? - She did all that for me? - [Craig] She loves you, buddy. - Hi. - How'd you get in here? - You've just got one of the sweetest little security guards downstairs. I told him you were expecting me. - You did? - Uh-huh. I don't know Harrison, is it hot enough for you? I swear to God, this just gotta be one of the hottest nights in the year. I can barely stand to have clothes on my body when it gets this way. - Oh really? - [T.C.] Here are the books you asked. - [Harrison] T.C. - Well. [Dee giggles] - Go back to the library, T.C. I don't feel like reading tonight. You like books, you read 'em. - Goodnight, sir. - Goodnight. - [T.C.] Don't let the bedbugs bite. - Listen, I hear you're looking for a new Dreamworld girl. - Well as a matter of fact, we might [chuckles]. - I sure do hope that I could get the first crack at it. - Crack, well I don't see why you shouldn't have a crack at it. - Oh, well that's just great. That's all I wanted. I guess. - Wait a minute, Miss, what the hell is her name anyway? What size are you, I mean what's your dress size? Would you like to come and try out a few things? - Oh yeah, sure, I'll try anything. - Yeah? Well here we are. - Oh, would you like some music? - Why not? - All right. ♪ Whatever you want ♪ It's just a dream away ♪ Whatever you need ♪ It's just a dream away - What time is it? - 8:30. - Ah ladies, the sweet smell of victory. - Did you get it? - Yeah. - Dee! [smooching] I gotta see this. - That's great. - [T.C.] Good morning sir, here are the refreshments you ordered. Your secretary stole a newspaper from me but the headlines state that the stock market is up two and half points and-- - Good morning, T.C. - Good morning, sir. - [Secretary] Mr. Harris. - And-- - Yes? - [Secretary] They are waiting for you in the demonstration room. - Who are? - [Secretary] All the members of the board, sir. - [T.C.] A big day when the shadows are forecast. There is no board meeting scheduled this morning, sir. But good luck anyway. - Thank you, T.C. - Anytime. - Why wasn't I given any notice of this meeting? - [Board Member] Sorry Harrison, I thought you knew Lucius asked us all to be here this morning. All the members of the board. - If this meeting is for board members only, what are they doing here? - Well the bank decided that the combination of Miss Montgomery's business expertise and her modeling experience would make her an invaluable member of the Board of Directors. - Do I sense a conspiracy in the air? - Absolutely, Harrison, we've got the 50% back. - You only have 45. - As of yesterday, I represent Eva's proxies. - Assuming it is 50-50, it's not gonna be that easy to get me out. I am still President. - We'd like to show you a little something that might change your mind, Harry. You watch too, Bunny, all right? [Harrison laughing] - I wonder where your wife thinks you are right now. - Slaving away at my desk. Poor old Meredith, she's as thick as a brush. She's almost as dumb as Bunny. - [Dee] You know I never could figure out what you were doing with that Bunny, what was it, Bridgette, Butt? - It's funny. [Harrison laughing] - Well you are a real wildcat. [Dee meowing] - It's just politics Dee, it's politics. You see, I had to find some way to get to that boring old goat grandfather of hers. He's a bigger fool than she is. - You really aren't well, are you Harrison? - Do you know what it was like to sleep with that lock-jawed bore? Did you know that she [chuckling], she even lisps when she snores. - Hmm? - That giggle. - Yes. - That giggle. And all to to keep that boring old-- [shattering] Birchwood Trust happy. Once more unto the breach, dear friends. That's Shakespeare, Dee, Shakespeare. - Shut up, Harry. - All righty. [laughing] - All right. - Okay momma, you did it. - Bernard, Miss Paget asked me to meet her here. - Ah yes Mr. Sloane, I have your table for you. - I'm glad you could squeeze me in. - Always a pleasure, T.C. - Thanks. - May I get you a drink? - The usual. - Wild Turkey? - You got it. [fingers snapping] [relaxed ensemble music] Oh. [Sloane laughs] - Now we're even. - [Sloane] Hey wait a minute, that's it? - What else would you like? - What about us? I need you, Kit. I love you. - Finally. - Yeah. I do. - I saw that headdress you're wearing. - Yeah? - It's fabulous. - You like it? - Yeah. - So how's Kit doing? - She's petrified. - And don't forget to wait for that extra beat in the music before you go, all right? - Tim, you're driving me crazy, please get outta here. - Get outta here? I put this whole thing together. My reputation, my credibility, my bank account is riding on this thing, huh? - Tessa, throw him out. - Yeah, come on Sloane. - Dream on, you can't throw me outta here. - I can. - What? - Come on T.C., be a good little wood nymph and let these slave-queens get on with their thing.
