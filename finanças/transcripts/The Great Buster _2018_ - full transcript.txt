But it did not have a happy ending He was just lying there at the end... you know , Was a great chase, with women chasing it Which were all brides a wonderful scene. And the movie just faded away and that's it... and the audience said He felt something was wrong , But right towards the end of the film He runs away from the women, and runs down the hill And stones move out of place and roll after it A big laugh from the crowd, and that's it , And he said. "We will photograph a new end" And he went back and filmed for about a week He built an avalanche , He started with three stones, which got bigger , And finally huge rocks, the size of these cameras That rolled after him. This is one of the best parts ever made Dick Cowt Well, he was actually a pantomime artist Frank Capra The mime artists, in fact, went bankrupt ... and besides, kill them , Something completely new.

"In" Family Medicine Show Joe Keaton, Myra Keaton , James Karen actor, friend of Buster Keaton , When they did their show , And disturbed them And the audience thought it was funny , When he turned four little Joe Frank Keaton , Really became a star in Woodville Buster was dressed just like his father, a beard without a mustache and an apron Joe Keaton was on the table , And did various acrobatic maneuvers , And Buster came behind him with a broom That's how that show started - When Buster was a little boy - He became famous as the human missile that his father, used to throw at his mother in their show "Now called" the three ketones The three kits are "considered a show". The most difficult in Woodville at the time , Had it not been so funny people would have been shocked or horrified , From the treatment of Buster on stage. But this was mostly an illusion They attached a handle to it, like a suitcase , Dick Van Dyke actor, friend of Steam Buster , Johnny Knoxville actor, comedian, stuntman In some states, his father has been accused of child abuse Because the show was mostly a projection, of little Joe everywhere on stage , And once, a famous case. Towards a man in the audience who was annoyed by his cries I said, "Did he throw you at the crowd?" "He was not a bad man." He always told me to tighten my ass. "Before he dumped me" , They were arrested several times, but managed to circumvent the law , Because, as Buster put it, the law states That “no child under the age of 16 will engage in acrobatics , "Walking on a rope"... playing a musical instrument, in a trapeze Everything was in the law, but it was not stated in it. It must not be kicked in the face Really unlikely That Joe Keaton really wanted, or intended to hurt his son Because Buster was the star of the show - Buster here - Buster earns her salary - - "Like his father." The three ketones The "three ketones" earned $ 750 a week 250 of them were Buster's This is during the period when a child received, pocket money of 5 cents a week And here he is driving around in his own car. At the age of 12 , Like his father, taught him how to fall, like any other acrobat , And in fact, from the top of a dozen performances Little Joe was slightly injured, only twice But this kid is having a lot of fun Every time he fell, they laughed And so he got his famous nickname , According to Buster's father, Joe , The famous magician Harry Houdini, a personal friend of the Keaton couple After seeing the child fall down the stairs, unharmed at the age of six months Was the one who said, "Your kid snatched a piece of Buster." Houdini may not have said that, but what does it matter? "In those days the word" buster "was used to describe a fall There was nothing more fitting At the end Buster Keaton fell, the funniest falls in cinema A real symphony of falls. Throughout his career We'll get back to that later - Woodville - "The Three Kittens", Myra, Joe and Buster Made for one of the most famous shows in Woodville .Who appeared all over the country again and again , And along the way the show grew "And" the three ketones. "We became" the four ketones Harry Jingles Keaton - "Then" the five ketones - Louise Keaton - , But in 1917, when Buster was 21 years old Their show fell apart Louise Keaton And he went out to support us all Yes, he decided that Louise and I Harry "Jingles" Keaton Buster travels to New York and gets a contract To perform at the annual Schubert Brothers entertainment show. In this case , "The Passing Show of 1917" Which was to go up, at the Winter Garden Theater on Broadway But fate wanted otherwise , When Buster was walking down a street in Manhattan he came across an old friend from Woodville Who was accompanied by a tall and tall man Which was known all over the world , Wanted luck and Roscoe Arbeckel, star since 1914 Just started making two-wheeled comedies For a guy named Joe Skank At Colony Studios on 48 East Street Both wheels lasted about 20 minutes each Arbakel said to Keaton, "Maybe you will come"?

Until the end of his life Buster returns in April 1919, to continue working with Arbeckel From which he learns a lot, about directing films Because Arbakel directed all his works .and enjoyed guiding his new friend , French Stewart actor Taught Buster Keaton .Make Movies Buster Keaton disassembled the camera, of Patti Arbeckel and reassembled Just to see how it works. And Patti Arbeckel almost killed him The goddesses of fate enter the picture again, in December 1919 The Collection, 1920 Crazy Marriage ", 1921" Remember that in those days, even though a movie, long was considered the main attraction Videos like Arbeckel's or Chaplin's .Are a very popular and profitable addition People have made an effort to see these videos .Sometimes they were the whole show Joe Skank moved Comic to Keaton To direct two comedies, which will be distributed through the Metro company, and will star in them "Roscoe Arbeckel" Dear Friend: I'm sending you a picture, "by Buster Keaton , A sad-faced guy who worked in my films "The man I chose will follow me "And the production of two-wheeled comedies" Keaton started working in the old, Charlie Chaplin studios in Hollywood "Now Called" Keaton Studios , And so, between 1920 and 1923 , Buster Keaton writes, directs and stars In 19 comedies two wheels. Quite popular - "Buster Keaton's Comedies-" He first creates a comedy, "called" The High Sign A name that refers to a ridiculous movement that identifies gang members Buster was not entirely happy with this video And he took it out. Only the following year But before he creates, another video , Douglas Parbanks, then King of Hollywood "Convincing" Metro, let Buster star in a long movie His first lead role in the film The Fool, "According to a Broadway Hit" A good buster in the film, who helps to establish his identity as the great "stone face" But nowadays the film looks pretty old fashioned It has no effect, on the creation of the film behind the camera But he contributes to his reputation. Immediately afterwards he makes another movie, "Two Wheels Called" one week Which is the first film to be distributed by Buster Keaton Productions In the plot, Buster and his new wife... get a house ready in advance .As a wedding gift But Buster's jealous opponent changes the numbers on the crates What creates a home that is a disaster "One week." "In my life, there is no better than" one week There's a great quote from Walter Kerr , "He said 'see' one week" "It's like that thing" that you never get to see "Garden at the moment of flowering" I was fascinated , Richard Lewis comedian, friend of Eleanor Keaton I said... this is the first time anyone has tried to do such a thing What a great joke with the train , Keaton said I always wanted the audience to try to guess. "" What shall I do, and then I will betray him The comedy received excellent reviews and won rave reviews Buster Keaton was on the road to success Buster Keaton Studios - Three more short films followed. "In 1920, including" Prisoner 13 If there was one thing Buster Keaton liked, it was the mechanical inventions As can be clearly seen in the scene. ”This amazing from“ The Scarecrow , Karl Reiner actor, director, screenwriter He had an engineering mind that he used to make people laugh In his backyard, he had small trains ... Lionel trains traveling in every direction , He had a picnic table in the corner , And he made the sausages in the kitchen, put them on the train Cho-cho, and send them out That's how he was , And the third short film of 1920. "Neighbors" , Bill Haider, comedian, actor, screenwriter Buster's head is stuck in the ground And his father tries to pull him off - Joe Keaton - I know a better method - than breaking his wrist He's my son, and I'll break his wrist if I want to Fun to watch them, because it's a guy who's doing nonsense with his dad There's something very sweet about it That they tear each other .the shape , The following year, 1921. Buster marries for the first time He and actress Natalie Telemage are married At Joe Skank's mansion in Long Island , Skank was married to Natalie's sister, 'popular actress Norma Telemag So Buster then became his brother-in-law In the same year, Keaton released six two-wheeled films "The Haunted House" "Unfortunate." He was fired from his job, the company - -... dumped him, luck abandoned him Now there is only one thing - that can be done , The movie we mentioned earlier, "The High Sign" The Goat Wanted for murder - $ 5,000 prize , "The Theater," Buster's Comedy Experiment Where he embodies all the roles in the dream segment And finally his great classic, "In the Two Wheels Movies," the boat Where the joke that was the hardest to perform was The sinking of the boat. Immediately upon launch , She refused to sink immediately And Buster thought that was the only way it would be funny Finally Buster and his team built a complex pulley system To pull the boat. Underwater "At this point" the stone face, we become a familiar nickname to the audience Like the flat hat he always wore The last thing he drowned If you can see it. "Write" a gift from Eleanor Keaton And she gave me a hat exactly the same as the one Buster used to wear My head swelled before we took a picture. I ate a spoiled sandwich , The boat itself was called Dempiano A name adopted by members of the International Buster Keaton Association The Dampineus In the movie the name becomes a joke when Buster sends an emergency call And was asked for the name of his boat - Dempiano - - I have no idea either - The boat itself is another invention, a mechanical mechanical of Keaton The invention is not exactly perfect He was born to be a comedian, of the silent film that his face His expressionless face expressed so much But Buster had big eyes, anyway .Also beautiful legs He had an empty face on which you could draw your feelings The face of the great stone. "Call it" a stone face. But it was not accurate Before Buster .there was a wide variety of expressions His eyes only expressed emotions most of the time. He just never smiled , He has a pantomime face... like Jean-Louis Barrow , Mel Brooks actor, director, screenwriter Buster had such a face I was impressed That this man can do many things without saying a word , And without moving his face. And you know exactly what the story is , The game lies in the eyes Not inside. , Sybil Shepherd actress, producer ... to sell something. No need to make an effort to sell it Enough to behave naturally Buster Keaton has always had... a quiet tragedy , Werner Herzog Director, Screenwriter, Producer , John Watts, director, screenwriter, producer Makes great facial expressions .and all sorts of clichés of the period , When you see it begins to disappear It was effortless When you say that - - smile This is the appearance of the stone surface You're not forced to laugh It just made me laugh "I just did Spider-Man," and there was a very clear impact , "In" Spider-Man... except that his eyes move a little Stone face I have a character who has almost... no expression inside, but You want to give her a lot of personality , And a lot of humor that will be expressed in the body... so I went and watched many ketone movies I used it as a base. "For many moments in" Spider-Man A total of seven successful two-wheeled films by Keaton were released in 1922 "Pale face" "My Wife's Relatives" He will not survive one week - - in this family The "volume" "day dreaming." My dear, I'm working in the borough - - the finances now, and sweeping big "The Electric House" - Stairs - And perhaps one of his shortest, most memorable films Cops "Going to the Screens" , Nick Carroll actor, comedian, producer The idea he appeared in, in very powerful comedic scenarios , But played them very seriously It's a fun aspect of comedy, which amplifies not only the humor But also raises the stakes .in every scene he played The part about "cops" where he grabs... that car and flies I mean, it's unbelievable Even he did not know how to explain it , I asked if the film was screened quickly. "And he said," No. How did he do that? It was superhuman There were no tricks. He just did it It would tear off the arm. For every other person District 5 Police Station - ... one of the things that always bothered me , Quentin Tarantino Director, Producer, Screenwriter , Because I really liked comedy, I really liked comedians There was the fact that they had to be, weaker than the other men in the film , They had to be childish, act like complete idiots , Or they had to be cowards, or they were scared The joke is that Bob Hope is standing in front of Jesse James It's always bothered me?... Why do they have to be less than Why can they not be men? Be masculine , And Buster Keaton was like that And he put himself in front of men, who were taller than him And therefore always had a slight height deficit He was a really exciting hero , In the same year, in 1922 He also does a parody of Star, Westerns William S. Hart , "Called" the frozen north, and the ruthless satire Hart always cried in his movies, so Buster exaggerated, of course Buster said, "Bill Hart has not spoken to me for two years "After seeing the movie" , Meanwhile, Buster's friend Patty Arbeckel is on trial , To his dismay - Arbakel faces the gallows - After three trials, Roscoe comes out eligible But the scandal nonetheless completely destroys his career To avoid any connection, to the tragedy of Arbeckel Skank changes the film company. Comic to Buster Keaton Productions His last two short films, coming out in 1923 , "The Blunt" "And his latest film," The Lovers' Nest In a sense, Buster Keaton is the essence of the movies He is one of the inventors of cinema "Remember Buster Keaton," is the book. He's always on my desk , Because they were the fathers of my industry. My art, my occupation The way they made movies is still the same way , Where we make movies. Basically They created this art form He was a great director He put himself in impossible situations There's no doubt that there's a downside to the game Cinema was important to Keaton The camera was not nailed to the floor , Or nailed to a moving truck But jokes that were funny. Because of the film camera .Cinema itself becomes a joke , I think a lot of my daring , In terms of breaking the fourth wall, came from Keaton "When" Sherlock Jr. indicates that it is a movie And I always point out somewhere in my movies that we make a movie It's like when I did "the" craze in space He did this. Buster has always been with me. And he will always be with me Our stunts are always real. No smears The man who does the stunts, really does them And he had strong feelings about it. And I also have strong feelings about it I stole from him as many moves as possible Buster said to collide with the floor, with your hands while you fall , Because they absorb some of the blow! The effect he had on me was that he knew how to do All kinds of crazy stunts And do crazy things, with his body But at the same time he also never .not too exaggerated in his performance , Such control over his body. Such agility He was like a ballet dancer Amazing control of the body , Amazing stunts, really Stunts that no one dared to do. I think Or he was not afraid. Or he was crazy He's really doing what you see, and that's true in almost every movie of his , Leonard Meltin Film critic, historian And in my eyes, the best special effect. In these movies is Buster himself , In the same year, 1923 Buster's long-standing wish is finally coming true And he starts making his own movies He finishes two. In those busy 12 months , In the five years that followed, Steam conceived, directed and starred While eight comedies, full-length When these ten are the greatest works of his career There is no doubt that the films he made in the 1920s They are his masterpieces. We will talk about them in detail later- Resolutions for the New Year 1929 - , Following these incredible records Buster does what he calls the "big mistake of my life." Joe Skank convinces Keaton to sign a contract , At Joe's brother, Nick Skank, in MGM The largest studio in Hollywood .and perhaps also the most regulated Both Charlie Chaplin and Harold Lloyd strongly advised him , Do not give up his independence But unfortunately, Buster relied on Joe Skank .They were very good friends .They were married to sisters But Skank actually made a deal with MGM Everything worked out for him afterwards Buster drank too much, his marriage fell apart Then the voice enters the realm of cinema and takes over The era of silent film is over, as Chaplin said Just when we learned to do it. "Properly, it's over" Just before he did that stunt, "With the Front of the House in a Movie" Dead Bill , Approached him and said Look, MGM just bought it. "Your rights" And he just went through all sorts of things with his wife Got bad news in two areas just before he did a stunt , Which could have killed him And yet he did it If there was a deviation, of one or two cm in each direction He could have been killed He felt so depressed and depressed that he did not care And this is the section that has been used more. Of every other section in history perhaps "We did it in Jackass 2. We did a tribute The man who prepared the stunt said, "Look, when you stand in that place." Do not move. "It is a 7 meter high steel wall" Then they said, 'Action.' I took a few steps, and then someone said, "Cut, cut, cut." I moved from my sign , There was silence on stage... except for my nine-year-old daughter, and she's like that Dad, idiot like you, what are you doing? And that loosened up the atmosphere a bit It was funny after all. Probably funnier , In all his short and long films, "except" The General Buster never had a script He and his men thought, of a good start And then found .satisfactory end , As he used to say, "the middle will work itself out." .Yes I heard he said that , If anything happened at that moment He said, "We would have an idea." And we would just do it This leaves room for a great deal of spontaneity , If you have a flash, it can affect the story , And instead of going in that direction, you can go in that direction , "In" three eras, as he leaps from one building to another , 'Ben Mankiewicz TV personality, producer But he does not succeed So he leaves it in the film, yes, it's a whole wonderful piece If it was completely unacceptable Well, you're in! "" Let's go The scripts were essential, everything was written explicitly , Discussed, budgeted. Scheduled by the hour Buster lost all his power. He lost his freedom. They threw it into the meat grinder, which was their production system Comedians like Buster, were used to having time to go out , Photograph things, try them in front of an audience , Shoot again, rethink the structure of the film , Radiate again and so on And Bam-G-Am were not built that way Keaton used to make films that came up Two or three times more than regular movies The movie "Dead Bill", for example, cost almost $ 500,000 , That year, a Lon Cheney movie And Cheney was very popular. Among the audience... $ 175,000 Immediately after Buster's first film, "BMG," the photographer You can tell the difference Even his flat hat has been replaced with a more upgraded version There are good moments in the film, but the timing and overall structure are weak , In his latest silent film, which he neither conceived nor directed , "Hate Marriage," has only one memorable passage And the studio wanted to get it out , Fortunately, he did not succeed And Keaton is crediting another classic, one last of the slapstick When he tries to put his drunken wife to bed This is a scene he will repeat on stage Until the end of his career In 1930, Buster starred in his first desert film "Free and easy" All boys with high blood pressure " All the girls with too much meat. "Your day has finally arrived" A step. "And then, that year," Duboys on guard! Terim, terim, terim. Both are not good. But they are successful "When I Saw" is free and easy, for the first time in 1969 "I wrote that he is, and I quote. Bad to Depression" Calculated almost perfectly, "destroying his planet A dismal mess where a person literally. "Can see Keaton drowning" End quote. Hell, the man said I'm a great comedian And I'll get a big contract and everything's great Of course, Buster was not involved in directing or writing these scripts Or of any other film, made with MGM , "Like" a living room, bedroom and bathroom, which by the way Photographed in part at his Italian mansion in Beverly Hills And includes a section that MGM repeats , From his two-wheeled film "One Week" Or the three films starring Jimmy Durante They are all obsolete over time. They are terrible. And you can see that he is not satisfied. That is, he looks miserable They do not understand that this man is a genius and it is impossible to connect him just like that ... with Jimmy Durante in. What a silly movie What is? what? No beer? Kangaroo, native to Australia What happened? My sister married one of them Buster was a very moderate man He did not talk much To protect himself ever It just boiled inside. He blamed himself for everything that went wrong I would say, These bastards. "You were not treated properly" "They were not that bad." "They treated you badly" ... no He just lost hope , 1932, Buster's wife, Natalie divorces him And officially changes the family name , 'Of their two sons from Keaton to Telmag Which broke him. The first marriage ended very badly He said, "I was not the best husband in the world either" What you can do "When you enter your dressing room" And a naked girl is standing there? Waiting for you I said, It really happened? "And he said," It happened all the time , The following year, 1933, Keaton had more problems with alcohol And after sent, several times for rehab There he met a younger sister named Mae Scriven , Which he eventually married Louis B. Meyer from MGM is tired of his drunkenness And he fires him It was the most failed treatment. With creative talent in history They destroyed it for years Abbott and Costello made their worst movie in MGM Laurel and Hardy made their worst movie in MGM , The Marx Brothers, after the death of Erwin Telberg Made their worst movie in BMG The studio was not a suitable place to create such slapstick comedies , Drunkenness increased, and after three years May divorces Buster This, in addition to many financial problems, finally overwhelms Keaton He suffered a nervous breakdown and was taken to a military hospital In a crazy shirt Buster Keaton - Psychiatric case Newspapers from the period reported that there was a fear that Buster would never play again By this time, he had already made all his great films And was at a low point in his life , And in the 1930s he made a film in France Who never came to the United States , When he returned by ship , Bill Erwin actor, comedian, screenwriter , The Great Woodville Comedian You know, talking fast , Baron Munchausen... you know ... worked with an accent And Keaton was very skilled, in these things And they set out to do a sort of conversation sketch My Aunt Sophie In the middle of the ocean, you went down to see your aunt Sophie Yes, yes, how did you get down? I got off the boat, got off and went to see her Because Keaton collaborated with the segment But Keaton did not do it from the heart. He looked tired , He did not really keep pace... and Munchausen with the whole thing And I'm telling you something. She was a grinder who played the piano She played... she taught Why do you not say something? And there was anger between them You know, I saw a fish tuning the piano Do you know what fish it was? I have no idea? ... and Munchausen... Jack Pearl caught him It's creepy... Keaton was "I think he's thinking? What am I doing here?" Why am I serving as an assistant to this vaudeville comedian? After a whole year, of full sobriety He drank what he called, his last drink, "swallowed it" And since then, rarely. Returned to drink alcohol again In his later years he drank, one and only glass of beer every evening , Only one that did not adversely affect him , Buster Keaton, sober comedian - - Back to work H E L P! H E L P! From 1934 to 1937, Keaton starred in 16 short comedy films For a company called .Adducational Pictures He did not have much influence, on their structure or direction But certain moments of decline are still evident in them "Minor", 1937 By this time he had already overcome, over the problem of his alcoholism But one of the stars next to him reports , Between the whips. Buster went to the corner in the set and cried In 1939 in Columbia Pictures he was hired to star In ten comedies two wheels Again, he has no control over the movies A nuisance from the west ", 1939" , Stars played hide and seek. "It was a night like this" They all have flashes of Keaton's magic, but not much more than that Dedicated Keaton fans are happy about their very existence But they are very far removed from his works in the 1920s Would you like to dance with me? If I want to? , He referred to all these films. "And that's a quote, as" cheats From 1937 to 1950, Buster worked at MGM here and there as a joke writer And as a director for the time being. In certain sections He helps Red Skelton renew some of his classics from the silent film era "Southern Yankee" is based on "The General", 1948 Well, I would have preferred. We were made a citizen He offers jokes to the Marx brothers and other people Buster was very modest Red Skelton "... I think it's going to be funny" , Then I would go out and do it but he always tried to convince Other people think that the idea was mine When he was Buster's His salary at MGM dropped from $ 3,000 a week One hundred dollars a week. That's all the amount you get, to work for them When you were recently one of the biggest stars of the studio And he said, "Well, if I am." Worth more, they will pay me more This is a very practical approach Keton Theme for a Young Dancer Woman - In 1940 Keaton marries for the last time With the beautiful and loving Eleanor Norris They met when she was a dancer She was a very warm and wonderful woman It was very important in the middle of his life and in his later years She saved his life, I understand , Was in it so directly, without nonsense A personality who said everything inside , And at the same time She was willing to do anything So that Buster's name will remain known Eleanor often plays the unconscious wife , "In Keaton's excerpt from" Hate Marriage Where he lays in bed the drunken wife. They did it together, everywhere Including the popular TV show Ed Ed Sullivan It was a very happy marriage that lasted until the end of his life Lie down. This is the best advice I can give you Want a spotlight? To make it look better in photography here. This will emphasize the sweat on his forehead I have to sober up In 1947 Buster appears one season. At the Madrano Circus in Paris It is a great success there , Two years later, in 1949, when he was 54 years old He returns to MGM in a supporting role opposite Judy Garland "In the Musical" on the good summer days He even writes and directs one scene in the film Scene written and directed by Buster Keaton , With Judy and the star next to her.

We forgot how In 1950 Buster was seen for a short time In the wild Hollywood drama, "by Billy Wilder," Sunset Boulevard When he plays one of the people Who are nicknamed the cruel "wax dolls" The others around the table, are fellow players Dim figures that you may still remember from the silent era I used to think of them as her wax dolls One diamond One heart Increased. for. Three without a ruler. for For. In 1953 he appeared with Charlie Chaplin , In several scenes in Chaplin's film. For fans of the silent film. This is a rare moment I never thought we would get to that The one and only time these two giants have been since the beginning of Hollywood Appeared together This is an amazing scene Norman Lloyd, appeared with Keaton and Chaplin in Stage Lights I thought it was a man who descended from another world I have a lot of souvenirs from Keaton Eleanor, beautiful Eleanor, she goes on to say "Yes, I was with him when he filmed it." "I was with him at the stage lights So I could ask, "How did Charlie treat Buster?" She said he treated Buster as if he were a king , In the last scene in the movie Buster took it upon himself to make sure That Charlie would get the best whip he could get Of his death scene Charlie designed the whip He's in the center of the camera, seemingly unconscious He could not see the whip, and there was no one to direct Charlie Buster... was by my side by chance I was not aware of it. Until I heard whispers , And as the camera moves away, I hear Buster say Do not move, Charlie. "" You're in the center of the whip. It is good They were two geniuses who collaborated together , Without any warning, in 1957 Paramount buys the rights to Buster's life And produces a biographical film starring Donald O'Connor , "Called" the story of Buster Keaton Which has almost nothing to do with the real story of his life But the $ 50,000 he received for these rights Let him buy his farm, in Woodland Hills, California She lived until the end of his life I'm Buster Keaton, a Woodville star? Where do I get a transit permit? There, in the studio manager's office. Thank you- Just a moment? Where's your transit permit? I go in to get him You can not log in. If you do not yet have a certificate Yes, but how am I? If the studio wants you, he'll send you a call - Famous Studio - It's Oscar night in Hollywood In 1960, Buster received a special award from the academy To mark his 40th year in cinema Just fitting the names of those who made these films They will also receive one prize or another In 1964, he appears in a short film, written by the avant-garde Irish playwright , Samuel Beckett "Simply Called" Movie And was all photographed in lower Manhattan Buster claimed he had no idea what this little movie was about And some of his fans despise the short film To this day he remains a controversial choice he has made , The following year, 1965 he stars in a short film Made for the National Railway Company of Canada and called "Railroad Man" - See Canada Now! It's like his short 20s silent film , He had a chance with it. After all the years of the studio system , Gerald Potterton May , And they had the time and place, they had 8-6 weeks And they created jokes, while working And he was again the same man who was in 1924 Great that he had a chance Make one last movie In this character. Preparation. OK. Camera. Play A film about his making was also shot at the same time Which contained some very interesting and enlightening moments In which Keaton develops a gag joke This is the whip of the bridge that was made. .See the valley here This very large bridge We'll find the two gag jokes I do not know. I guess, my stick, everything else And now I'm wondering where I am I'm taking out the map, and when I unfold it, I'm helpless When I'm here, a whip passing over the struts, everything's funny I'm chasing them, but fighting paper at the same time The director decided not to accept Buster's idea Instead of being wrapped in a map, Keton crosses the bridge while doing laundry What happened? He did not tell you what to do No. I did not know that he replaced my joke Does not matter. There are still two whips. Until a section is completed, Buster ... There's a remote photo of the bridge When they travel over it. This is the whole center of the joke The distance photo of the bridge What's the matter with the bridge? The bridge is not your joke The bridge is just tension, excitement. There is no joke on the bridge .It has no meaning It's just a dangerous place to be in. When there might be a collision That's the only thing that's funny I know the main reason they did not want you to go over the struts When you're wrapped in newspapers and all that. It's because it's too dangerous "They said," Who? suggested the jokes? I I said, "Usually I know." What I do It's not dangerous. It's a child's play, for God's sake - "The Beach Bunch", 1965 But the most notable acting job... at the end of his career Has been in some movies in the very popular series On beach parties for teenagers. In the 60s , "And among them" the beach gang. "And" how to fill a wild bikini - "How to fill a wild bikini", 1965 Sorry, I was visiting a house The young men seemed to like the old Buster But they knew nothing about his story and his past Tell the daughter to come here A true professional daughter Her name is.Witch of a Wizard Frankie wants to go back to the beach where Didi is right away Daughter, you're a good girl He worked until the last minute. "He died when he did the" Halbler "Helbler", 1966 And Keaton was shocked That one expects it to use a double. Somewhere There were some distant photographs, in which the double is seen Because he was terminally ill. At that point , 'He died in 66.on one February I was working on a TV show in New York , And my son called and said "Are you done?" "And I said, 'No, we'm not done yet He said, "Call me when you're done." "I called him when I'm done" and I said, "I'm done. What's going on "We lost our buster," he said. He dies while standing , He was an excellent bridge player 'One of the best bridge players in the world For a long time he made a living from playing bridge With many of the important people in BMG Louis B. Meyer, and all those people who dumped him '' But they played bridge with him In his house, he had a small room Who was ready to play cards. , On his last day... he was restless ... and he played badly And he played standing up. He sat down and died I eulogized Stan Laurel, one day in February , And exactly one year later, in February, in the same church I eulogized Buster And they were all there except Buster , In the fall of 1965, just a few months before his death Honor the Buster at the Venice Film Festival , For his entire career, with a special mention, of course Of the ten most expensive films from Pez. Which he made in the 1920s And the first of them is called, "Three Ages" Where Buster made a parody of D.W. Griffith's long-running drama ,"intolerance" , And described the relationship between Keaton, his lover and the villain , Who was always Wallace in shooting In three completely different periods ...the stone Age ...ancient Rome Then 1923 Yet his first film that told one continuous story Was the stinging, brilliant, and tear-jerking film "Hospitality" A moderate masterpiece Inspired by the infamous conflict between Hatfield and McCoy When a buster is the main target Once the family of the girl he fell in love with , Reveals his identity as the heir to the conflict Buster becomes a walking target Of course it was in the days that were controlled. I only had one shotgun , Eventually, he realizes this but also discovers that the father told his sons That they can not kill him. As long as he is a guest in their house Again, Keaton really enjoys having fun. With a dark and murderous situation In fact, at the beginning of the film the game is quite serious , And is filmed in a very dramatic way There is no doubt that Keaton chose, in as dark an opening as possible To show that there is a very real danger, hovering over Keaton's figure Which helps to boost the humor Once Buster arrives at the arena. Keaton also insisted, on historical accuracy Starting with the ridiculous but faithful reconstruction, for an early train Which actually combined components, from the very first two trains really One is British and the other American In the finale appears the stunt, perhaps the most spectacular of Keaton , When he saves his girl from the waterfall The girl who was then his wife. Natalie Telemag Two classics of Keaton. Released in 1924 , "Sherlock Jr." where he screened films He imagines himself... in a film he is screening With some amazing tricks .and most innovative in photography The dream segment, is an amazing achievement even today And the thought that he managed to do it . .. as beautiful as he did back in 1923 this is simply amazing. And one piece that proves that Buster... was a very talented Paul actor It has already been clarified that the 13th ball has a bomb , So Keaton manages to avoid .with miraculous skill, and does not hurt him It was sweet on his part. He bequeathed me his bean stick ... he was sharp. And it's tied together His name is written on it It's probably worth a lot of money now, no? I will never give it up In this movie Buster also suffered a serious injury Although no one will claim he was not harmed. More than enough in his career Almost Nature - - "Hospitality" Broken ankle - "The electric house" Lost consciousness due to cannon - "The General" Flashlight in the eye - "Living room, bedroom and bathroom" But in "Sherlock Jr." Buster broke the wrist, and did not know it for years Water burst and slammed Buster into the rail, causing a rupture But it was certainly not possible to identify it by his movement , Which was as vigorous as ever. And everything was filmed in one go He had headaches for a while, but he did not feel anything was wrong Years later, a doctor told him, "When did you break your wrist?" , "Buster replied," I did not break. "And the doctor replied," Yes, you broke Keaton hired Roscoe Arbeckel to direct with him under a pseudonym Because of the scandal. Buster suggested the name. Will B. Good ''But Roscoe chose William Goodrich'' The middle name of his father. But Buster discovered, unfortunately, that Roscoe was no longer the man he used to be In the same year, 1924 another classic Keaton film was released Among the most popular, "in his films," The Navigator Who was born only from the fact that one of his colleagues US Buford "also known as" the navigator What can Buster do with a ship? He created, just a comic masterpiece Where both Buster, and the girl he loved , Who rejected his marriage proposal, staying alone , Using a series of coincidences on an abandoned ship. One of the most memorable sections is the following section Where they both discover .there is another man on the ship Keaton wonderfully constructs the horribly spoiled background of his character In a supremely economical opening. - Will you marry me? - No way! - I think a long walk will help me But there are a lot of jokes that can be made on a ship Danger - Men at work , The following year, 1925 Buster made a film with a theme, in which he was not particularly interested But Joe Skank bought Keaton the play so he could make a movie out of it And Buster felt that he must do his best , "The Movie," Seven Opportunities, is not one of his best But it contains some of Buster's most marvelous works The section where thousands of women, chasing after him, then an avalanche As we showed at the beginning of the film Here's another amazing piece Another film released in 1925 was Buster's eccentric love story Between Keaton and an enlarged cow Go West "Definitely Not Gone", his funniest movie , But it is strangely touching. And the love between the two is tangible At the end, the real "brown eyes" went after Buster wherever he went - Burn a mark on this violation - In 1926, one of Keaton's funniest films And his least known today is "The Warrior Butler," is not a farce of misidentification But a comedy about a man who claims... that he is a famous boxer They have the same name To impress the girl. Where he is in love Of course the man Buster plays thinks he'll never have to box To win the girl, but he had to box And the first time he entered the arena to practice It's one of the funniest parts - Raise your hands - Near the beginning, "of" the warrior Butler Keaton, a rich and pampered boy... trying to go fishing And maybe shoot a duck. And the part that is all one whip is a series of wonderfully timed jokes Built flawlessly. And that was the first cut Good evening. Here's Orson Welles To my great pleasure , Show tonight In this series, of great silent films The one of the greatest movies of all time , One of my favorites , "The General." By and with Buster Keaton , Then, in 1926 Here comes the film that many consider today, Keaton's greatest work The General, "a daring and filmed comedy," his wonderfully about the Civil War Recently selected by film critics and historians To number 18 of all the films ever made He was also voted the best silent film of all time Few films in all of history have matched it On the subject there is certainly no rule It's visually stunning. "A hundred times" passed with the wind , But while the film was coming to screens The general "is not considered that great" And was criticized by those who claimed it was not funny to see the dead The stone face “created a dark comedy.” Before that concept was even created , The film was not a great success, and yet Buster himself has always said that "The General" is his best film Not only is it a movie, extremely funny all the time I am also an avid supporter, in action cinema And this is one of the best action movies , He chose to play a southern soldier because he thought the audience Will not show sympathy for a northern soldier. Since the north won the war He's creating a more deadly version of the cannon joke from The Navigator He also photographed what was at the end of the single most expensive whip In the history of silent cinema. Buster's last two independent films are If we're just talking about laughter, maybe the funniest of them all In 1927, "College" went on the screens , He did not have much success, but it is difficult to understand why Because it's full of excerpts Harold Lloyd was a huge success, with "The Student" in 1925 A story that takes place in a college he was in. Very funny material about football Keaton put in his film. Any other possible sport At the beginning of the film Buster tries to get a job as a soda seller And looks at a professional seller in his position He claims he can succeed. No less than him What comes next is one of Keaton's most powerful comedic passages , In a later scene His classmates are harassing him in a section with a brilliant structure - Welcome to the ship King - Buster's last independent film was released in 1928 The last miraculous year of the silent cinema era The Dead Bill "is still one of the creations," funny to his tears Peak in an amazing hurricane section It's basically a story about a boy who tries to impress a father who left a long time ago Schmid immediately dislikes almost anything, in his unimpressive son Especially his hat First thing, a new hat Buster even cool, internal joke into it By quickly hiding the flat hat Has been linked to it for a long time. Buster is in love with the daughter of the wealthy owner of the new steamer Who strives to bring about the bankruptcy of the father And his old steamer The girl's father forbade Buster to board his ship Buster's father insists that Buster stand his ground And will board his company's ship This leads to one of the funniest passages In a bright, and lastly silent, masterpiece that is so beautifully constructed His tenth in five years - That's what it's for - Thus ended the Great Decade , His independence, his marriage , His silent films, everything he achieved... forgotten And he soon fell prey to a land that Vidal described As "The United States of Amnesia". , In 1965, a year before Keaton died Venice Film Festival, made a tribute to the great Buster And the crowd rose to their feet and applauded him for the longest period of time In the history of this Italian festival. For more than ten minutes, the returns continued And Buster was moved to tears He found it hard to believe That someone loves these movies. That he created so long ago Eleanor told me he did not understand It happened 50 years after he made these movies And they were appreciated .as if they were screened for the first time And he did not understand it Amazing how eternal it is and how much A physical comedy of this kind. You will never stop laughing It was funny then, it's funny now. And it's going to be funny in a hundred years About some filmmakers? It can be said "They remembered me," he said And yes, he will never be forgotten Crane Peter Bogdanovich: "The Big Buster" Translation by Naomi Mazuz Edited by Hagar Arubs Mazur Production of: Trans Titles Ltd.
