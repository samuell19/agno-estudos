I'm thinking maybe a possible brake failure. - How's the driver? - Well, he died en route to the hospital. Looks like we're gonna lose the brakeman, too. - What's your liability? - The whole package. Hope you can find something mechanically wrong with that truck. - You know me, Paul, if it's there I'll find it. - Do your best. - Stosh, just get it back to the shop. Taylor Webb may be buying another car to switch over. It's about time you learned the business. I'll stay here and make sure I get all the pieces. I'll see you later. - All Auto, five 15.

Taylor Webb Used cars. - Yeah. - 333 dollars. - 1973 Challenger, number 22. - Hey, Atlee, how come you never get called at five o'clock in the morning? - 'Cause I live right. - Well, I'll fix your living habit. Tomorrow morning you can get up at five and start tearing down that truck to find out how come he hit the train. - Okay, if Stanley helps me. I think two years in the Army gave him brain damage. - Hey, hey, I'll learn the business next week. I don't even know how these switch-overs work. - Well Stanley, it goes like this. Taylor Webb buys a wrecked car. We cut it up, and save the serial numbers, the engine and trans, and junk the rest. Then we go out and steal one identical, and put these serial number from the wrecked car on the new one. - Well don't the police and the insurance companies check these guys? - Oh, the odds about 5,000 to one. Do you know how many cars are in Los Angeles County alone? Over two million. - Hey, Stanley, what's your new girlfriend's name? - Jill, why? - Gonna name this car after her, 'cause she's a wreck, too. - Hey, Maindrian, I need your trunk-locking key. - Hey, Stanley, got the mileage? - Yeah, it's uh, 6891, five tenths. - Hey, Atlee, what kind of tires are those? - They're Goodyear E7814. - Two-stripe or one-stripe? - They're two-stripe. - I'm going back in the Army. - I think that's a good idea. Take Corlis with, he's in a bad mood. - Ah, cram it, you guys. - Ah, that's 'cause his sweetie is in New York. - Corlis, Why don't you give me a hand, get those doors over there. - Do I have to do everything while I'm here? - Why you have to-- - Hey, I'm hungry. - Come on, let's go. - Come on. - Want this motor over there now? - Yeah, let's go Atlee, Atlee, get the truck in here get this back body section of these doors loaded.

Do not leave parking ticket in your car. Please lock your car. Do not leave articles on the seat. Do not leave parking ticket in your car. Please lock your car. Do not leave articles on the seat. Do not leave parking ticket in your car. - Hey Atlee, how'd you get mixed up with Pace, anyway? - Well, I'll tell you Stanley, I used to steal trucks, and one day this dude comes in, he say he's Maindrian Pace for some insurance company, and he's here to investigate a truck I bought. Well, he walks around the truck, opens his briefcase, and right away I see these pictures of my truck all wrecked up and stuff. Then he said, "Mr. Jackson, do you realize "you can to jail for stealing, like you can for lying?" Right then I knew he had me, but he made me an offer. And here I is, me, Investigator Jackson, stealing cars, I still haven't been caught. - Atlee, when you came to work for me, you became a pro. The amateurs are in jail, professionals never get caught. - What about Bush Doctor? He was a pro, over 400 cars and they nailed him. - Well, he got sloppy. - You don't get sloppy in this business. - Jill just became a statistic. One of the 32 percent of the cars stolen never to be recovered again. Holy Christ, I gotta be in Vilas' in 20 minutes. - Hey, you want me to come with you? - No, they said to come alone. And for 400,000 dollars, I'm going alone. See you guys later, get this place cleaned up. - Mr. Pace, you came highly recommended from our associates in Argentina. - Thank you, Mr. Vilas. - Like you asked, 200,000 dollars up front. This is a lot of money. Those cars must be at the docks for transfer delivery Saturday, no later than five. They must be there. Now, I don't need to tell you the consequences if you fail to perform. - Don't worry, Mr. Vilas. - I don't worry, that's your job. Saturday, by five. - Here's a list and the code names of the cars we're gonna need. What was that black football player that played for the Green Bay Packers? Remember, we handled loss on his trucks at the distributing company? - Oh, yeah, you mean Willie Davis. - Yeah, that's him, Davis. Yeah, he drives a burgundy Rolls. Here's his address. Now I want you to have as much of this information ready as you can by the time we get back on Sunday. Now, here's how we'll handle it. What are the uh, the first two are Stutzes. Let's see, I code named 'em Donna and Karen. - Yeah. - But, you'll have to redo this so we can read it. - Yeah. - But just go down the line here and code name 'em. I want all of 'em listed this way, all the way down. - Okay, I'll put 'em in order, yeah. - Get the rest of this junk cleaned off here. - Yeah. - Also, uh, lemme see what was it, oh, I want you to get both undercover cars serviced and ready to go. - Okay. - Okay? And you'll pick us up at the airport or take us to the airport at 8:30. - Here they come! - Hello, this is the long-distance operator. Is this the Kosciuszko Club in Dunkirk, New York? - Yes, it is. - I have a collect person-to-person call for a Mandrian Pace from an Atlee Jackson of Chase Research in Los Angeles. Will you accept the charges? - Uh, hold on a moment, operator, I think he's with the wedding party. I'll have to find him. - All right, I'll hold. - This is Maindrian Pace. - Will you accept a collect call from an Atlee Jackson? - Yes, I will, operator. Atlee, how come you're calling collect? You in jail or something? - No, but I think we all gonna be. I been going over this list, And I think you lost your mind. Do you realize there are 48 cars on this list, and nine are Rolls Royce, seven limousines. They even want Parnelli Jones' Big Oly Bronco. Four Ferraris-- - Atlee, Atlee, what are you trying to say? - There's no way we can steal and switch over this many cars by Friday. - We don't have to switch 'em, just clean 'em up, take off the license plates and deliver them to the docks. - We're still gonna need some more help. - Just getting ready to tell Eugenius to hold off his honeymoon for a week. - You gonna tell a boss to wait a week for his honeymoon? Good luck. - Listen, Atlee. You just get to work on those insurance files. I can think of at least 25 cars in those files right off-hand. And don't worry about Eugene. You just be at the airport to pick us up. - Okay, why you wanna talk to me? - We got a little problem. We have to deliver over 40 cars to the docks by Saturday. - What do you want me to do? - I want you to postpone your honeymoon. - Hey, I'd like to help you out, it's my wedding! - You don't seem to understand. We gotta deliver over 40 cars to the docks by Saturday. We've got all our regular work, plus we got three court appearances this week. - That's a sad story. Why don'tcha call me up in three weeks when I get back from my honeymoon? - I want you to listen. - You goddamn-- - Hey, hey. - Please, Maindrian, not here. - You might've inherited most of the shares when your old man died, but your brother and sister have held up your end, plus theirs, ever since. Now it's about time you shape up. Because the three of us can vote you out. Pumpkin, I want him on that plane tomorrow, or he's out. - Maindrian, I worry about you and Eugene, you're always fighting. - Do me a favor, let's not talk about him. Just make sure he's on that plane tomorrow, okay? - Hey, I saw the nicest house, can we go look at it when we get back? - Oh boy. - Come on, you know I love you. Besides that, it was always Papa's dream that we get married someday. - I know. - I'm a good cook, too. - You just want me to be fat like all the other Polacks. - Yeah, then no one will look at you. - Hey, we got a contract to fill. - How about after the contract? - We'll talk about it then, okay? - Promise? - I promise. - Look at the house, too? - Well, we'll talk about it. - Okay. - Mr. Eugene Chase. - Yeah, right here. - Hello, Mr. Chase. - Atlee, Atlee! Old blue eyes is back. Hey, you been workin' hard? - Hi, Atlee, how ya doin'? - Just can't trust nobody, Atlee. - Hey, thanks for coming by but actually I'm going. We got lots of work to do. - You do? - Yeah. Hey, I want you to go with Jenny. - Okay. Bye bye! - Bye! - Go with Jenny and help her get settled down. - Okay, fine. - You get everything ready? - Hold everything, hold everything. There's Eleanor. Get the briefcase. - Let me do it, my knack is back. I can feel it in my bones, just let me handle it. - You'll handle it. Okay. - Left the key in the car. - Really? Stosh? Okay, Stosh, let's go. - Thank you. - Thank you. May the Lord be with you, child. - What in the world? - Sorry, lady, I thought it was my car. Wrong car! Pretty damn funny. You said I'd be picking my ass up off the sidewalk. - Don't worry, Corlis, I got Eleanor's license number. Come on, Atlee, let's take a ride around the airport. Gotta go to work now. - Lucky. - All right, pay up. - Bet you can't do it again. - Double or nothing? - You're on. - Game's over, let's go. - Easy money. - I don't wanna sound like a drill sergeant, but this is the biggest contract we've ever handled. I don't want any mistakes, so pay attention. - Doesn't he look good with his gray hair? - Ah, he looks like a Polack. - At least my mother didn't name me Atlee. Atlee, you've been with us for three years, and you're about as good as I am. There's Corlis's wig, we're gonna do this different. You're gonna be working with Corlis. Stosh, you're coming off shop detail, and you're gonna learn all about it. Here's a list of the code names. I want you to look at 'em, study 'em carefully, and get to know 'em. That's the only way you're gonna refer to these cars from the day on. Pumpkin, I want you to get on this list of cars, check 'em all out, see if the addresses are all current. And I want you using only the phone that Atlee here has got tied in to the switchboard next door. - Now, Maindrian, remember we're only going after cars that are insured. - Right, if you guys have any questions just have Pumpkin run a 10-28 on them. If there's a legal indicated, that means they're usually insured. I know it's been a long day but we got some easy hits tonight. I've got the DMV info on Eleanor and she lives over in Torrance. - I found the Italia. I remember seeing this picture of Lyle Waggoner in Playgirl magazine. - You got any more? - Yeah, we can get Parnelli Jones' Big Oly Bronco, it'd be on display at the racing today. - Good, you and Corlis handle it. - Okay. - Now one more thing, you guys. All the personal effects go into duffel bags that go to the shredder. We don't wanna keep any cameras, typewriters, all that stuff can be traced. Now there are some new additions to the briefcases. Make sure the walkie-talkies are always on. Same for the police radios in your cars. That'll keep you on top of things and outta jail. Now this is our new compact key cutter. Take a look at that, Atlee. - Oh, yeah, I'll brief Corlis on this. - Pumpkin, I want you to get as many of the code numbers for the keys as you can. That'll keep us from popping locks, especially the foreign cars. Any questions? - Nope. Good. Let's go to work. Okay, Atlee, go by and pick up Corlis, huh? - Yeah, I'll go get him. - Okay, meet here. - Yeah. - Atlee, don't take any chances, check on all your equipment. - I'm not a Polack. - Let's go, Stosh. Damn, tired of this. Make sure you always have your walkie-talkie on, and there's your, your squelch. - Okay? - - Okay.

Hello. - Hello, Pace, you're right on time. - You look a little tired. - Oh I'm nervous and upset. - What's the matter? - Well it all started Sunday night when J.C. Agajanian's Rolls Royce was stolen. And yesterday four more expensive cars we insured were stolen. If they're not recovered within 30 days, we stand to lose 150,000 dollars. - You know I read about that, J.C.'s car was at Ascot, wasn't it? - Yes, but here's the clincher. Last night, someone stole Parnelli Jones's Big Oly Bronco which we insure for 100,000 dollars. And, if it's not recovered within 15 days before the race, we stand to lose a quarter of a million. - I'll bet the odds against that are one in 10,000. - One in 22,000. - I'll bet underwriting is just delighted. - Gentlemen. - - Yes. - Mr. Jones can see you now. - Thank you. - Parnelli, nice seeing you. - Yeah, see you later Bob. - - See you again. - Okay, bye Lisa. - Much luck at Indy. - - Lisa. - Mr. Jones, I'm Frank Acrino from your insurance company and I talked to you earlier.

What can you tell us about the theft? - We definitely think it was done by professionals. The police just couldn't find anything, and-- - Are you sure it was stolen, I mean, not just misplaced or left in one of the trucks or something? - Well, I'm sure that it wasn't misplaced. - Is this a picture of it here on the wall? - Yes, as a matter of fact that was taken last year down in Mexico. - Can we see the area where the Bronco was stolen? - Sure, right this way. - Well, they definitely couldn't drive it or put it on the street or anything like that. - Well it is one of a kind, and uh, I'd really like to have it back. - Well, we'll do everything we can to get it back for you, Parnelli. Tell me, Frank, does your company have an insurance policy on these too? - Yes x to the tune of 8 million dollars. - Oh, it isn't that bad, Frank, it's all your imagination. You shouldn't let little things like that bother you. - Right here's where the Bronco was stolen from. - Well it's definitely not there now. - Excuse me, Parnelli, but Jim Cook is on the line. - Okay, I'll just take it down here. - Okay. - Excuse me, gentlemen, but uh, just get my Bronco back. - If we can't find it, Frank's company will just have to pay your 350,000 dollars. - Well I'd rather have my Bronco back. - We'll do our best. - I'll drop by the police department, pick up the report, and have it in your office right away. - Okay, Frank, I got work to do, I'll see ya later. - Bye. - I'm here for Lyle Waggoner's car. - What, man? - I'm here for Lyle Waggoner's car. - What?

Seems someone ripped off a Manta. - What's a Manta? - It's the 35th expensive car stolen in three days. You heard about that, didn't you? - Listen, all I hear is the insurance company screaming at us every time they lose a lousy dime. - Maindrian! - Mm, comfort. - Why don't you back this up so Eugene can get in the office there, yeah. - Yeah sure. - Would ya? - Yeah. - - Thanks. All right! - That's good. - Mm, I've been working too hard. Look, do me a favor and keep your ears open for me, will ya? - Sure, Hawkins. - You know something, Vicinski? There's probably been five more cars stolen in just the time I've been here. - Nah, I don't think so, Hawkins. Good night. - Goddamn, are we lucky. - Look, I say we peddle the stuff right now! - We'll talk about it in the morning. - No, we're gonna talk about-- - We'll talk about it in the morning. - Maindrian, we have to give Eleanor back. - What are you talking about, the contract's filled. - She's not insured, here, look for yourself. - You've gotta be kidding. "Owner desperate, '73 Ford Mustang stolen "from 18511 Mariposa in Gardena. "Not insured. "Please return. No questions." Pumpkin, I'm tired. I'm not Superman. Look at that. That contract is filled. - Maindrian. - Damn you, Pace!
