[Knock on door] [Knock knock knock] Woman: breakfast, Mr. Smith. Well, what are they doing? She's under the bedclothes, and he's playing cards. You didn't look through the keyhole. You can't see anything anyway. I only listened. [Telephone rings] [Ring] Smith residence. No, Mr. Custer, they haven't come out yet. Well, they just opened the door for breakfast now, but they didn't let out any dishes. I'm running out of dishes. Well, they've been in there 3 days already. What's the longest they've kept this thing up? 8! Has Sammy gotten there yet? He's just come in. It's Mr. Custer. Yes, Mr. Custer? Now, listen, Sammy, that paper's gotta be signed. So don't you leave there till it is signed, understand? I'm depending on you, Sammy. I'll come back with it signed, Mr. Custer. [Sighs] Take me to the room. Mr. Smith? Mr. Smith, it's me Sammy, from the office. Sammy: Mr. Custer says you'll have to sign this. We can't keep postponing the case. Push it under the door. I'm putting it under the door, Mr. Smith. See. You signed it in pencil. Smith: I haven't got any ink. It's no good in pencil. Well, then go over it with a pen. But that's forgery! No, it isn't. Anyway, nobody'd know. But, Mr. Smith, I take my bar examination next June. I could get into trouble. Give me a pen. Thank you, Mr. Smith. Thought I left, huh? What would you do if I walked out that door? Leave me? Forever? As long as we live, we must never change that rule. That's right. You know, if every married couple had it, there'd never be a divorce. They ought to put it in the marriage ceremony. You are not allowed to leave the bedroom after a quarrel unless you've made up. Well, that's simple. Eventually you'd have to make up. Most men can't afford to stay away from the office 3 days at a crack. Remember the 8-day session? And the 6? Yeah, there were 2 6s. 2? One Christmas week and, uh... The other one the weekend of the Yale game. That was really 5 and a half. We started in the afternoon. How about some breakfast, woman? Ain't we manly? We've got respect for each other as persons. That's our big trick. Mm-hmm. Man and woman, all right. But person to person, that's important in a marriage, too. Mm-hmm. Make like this. You know, I think we'd be friends if we were men or women, don't you? Mm-hmm. Respect for each other as individuals, that's what counts. To always tell the truth, no matter what the consequences. You know, I think if we told each other just one lie we'd have to admit we failed, wouldn't we? Mm-hmm. And what would we have left? A marriage like other people's. Doubt, distrust, going on with each other because it's the easiest way. Mm-hmm. Your barber's shaving you too close. I wish you'd talk to him. Mm-hmm. You know, it was all my fault. No, my dear, it was mine. It was my fault, dear. Uh-uh. mine, darling. I shouldn't be jealous so much and I should, uh... Lay off your family. A wife should conduct herself to please her husband. That's one of the rules I'm going to make. Another one? Mm-hmm. What's the date today? Uh, darling, I think I'd better be running along. Oh, no, honey. Not just yet. Remember rule number 7? Yes, but I thought we'd given that one up. It always got us into so much trouble. If we ever give up one, that means we're giving up just that much of our wonderful relationship. That we're letting down. You wouldn't want me to feel that, would you? But those questions you ask each month. About that trip I took to Paris the year I graduated from college. I was only 21. Well, I forgave you that. [Sighs] Shoot. If you had it all to do over again, would you have married me? Honestly, no. Not that I want to be married to anyone else. But I think that when a man marries, he gives up a certain amount of freedom and independence. If I had to do it all over again, I think I would stay single. We wanted me to answer you truthfully because we respect each other. We're honest with each other. Your feelings aren't hurt, are they? No, no. It's perfectly all right. That's enough of that. I was getting into trouble. I'm not angry in the least. Oh, yes, you are. You don't understand. I was only answering a hypothetical question of what I would do if I had to do it all over again. David, if you want your freedom, I don't want to be the kind of a wife who clings to her husband when she's not wanted. Darling, I do want to be married to you. I love you. I worship you. I am used to you. How do we always get into these things? Well, if my only hold on you is that you're used to me. Oh, darling, you've got the whole thing wrong. I don't know what I'd do without you. You are my little girl. I... Now don't cry. Don't cry. Forgive me? Say you forgive me. [Sighs] Now can I go to work? I'll come back early, and I mean early. Don't work too hard, darling. [Sighs] Morning. Good morning, Mr. Smith. Good morning, Mr. Smith. Well, morning, David. Morning, Jeff. Well, you know how she is. You've got to humor her in these things. Don't apologize to me, David. I envy you from the bottom of my heart. I wish I was in your shoes. Yeah, she's a great kid. It certainly piles up, doesn't it? [Door opens] Yeah, what is it, sunny? There's a Mr. Deever been waiting to see you. He won't tell me his business. He says it's something private. Well, send him in. Well, I'll leave you to your miseries, David. What about lunch at the club, if you can make it? I'll try and make it, Jeff. Mr. Deever. How do you do? How do you do? Uh, won't you sit down? Uh... What can I do for you? Were you married in Beecham in march 1937? Yes, I was. Well, you know, Beecham is on the other side of the river. And it was always incorporated in Brender county. But, you see, Brender county is in Idaho. And so, uh... Well... You follow me, don't you? Yes. Yes. Well, we in Beecham found out we had no right to be incorporated in Brender county. Because, from the other side of the bass river, we belong in Nevada. Yes. Well, well, well. Yeah. Well, we just found out that anybody who got married between 1936 and now, with an Idaho license in Nevada... Well, it isn't legal. What do you mean, it isn't legal? Now, now, now. I don't want you to be frightened, or upset, or anything. But there's been a kind of a mistake. You're not legally married. What's that? Oh, oh, oh, you really are married and everything, but there's a little technicality. It's perfectly all right, you understand, common law and everything. But we figured in case of...Deaths, and wills and births-- you know, children-- we figure it'd be better if everybody kind of got married again, just to be on the safe side. And the chamber of commerce is sending me around to everybody to tell them. And we give you your $2.00 back. You can use it to get another license. Kind of funny, isn't it? Heh heh heh. Yeah. I been doing this 2 weeks now, just in New York. A lot of couples came to New York. I had a hard time locating them. Yeah. Ha ha. Well, I guess I'll be going now, Mr. Smith. I hope you don't hold this against Beecham. It really wasn't our fault. Oh, no, not at all. Is that your wife? Uh-huh. Was she Annie Krausheimer? Yes, yes. She lived right across from Beecham. That's how we happened to get married there. Did you know her? Did I know her? Why, when she was this high, she and my kid sister used to go running in and out of the house all the time. I remember like it was yesterday. I can't get over that. I guess she's changed some, huh? Well, she's changed a little. She once chased a dog catcher a half a mile with a baseball bat. Well, she hasn't changed as much as you'd think. Sure is a fine looking woman. Tell her I was asking for her, will you? Old Harry Deever. She'll remember me. Indeed I will. Thank you very much, Mr. Deever. Good-bye, Mr. Smith. Good-bye. uh, you can find your way out? Deever: yeah, yeah. Yes, thank you. Ahem. Sunny: yes, Mr. Smith? Get me my home. [Buzz] Hello? Oh, hello, dear. Yes, darling. Where do you think I'm going to take you for dinner tonight? No. No. No. Momma Lucy's. Honey. I didn't think you even remembered the name of the place. We haven't been there since before we were married. Oh, I love you. You want to pick me up here about 6:00? Bye, darling. Oh, oh, driver. I'll get off here. Well, dear, I must be going. All right, mother, dear. Mr. Harry Deever. He says you remember him from across the river in Beecham. Oh, yes. Show him in, Lily. Harry Deever? Bertha Deever's brother. Why, Harry Deever, this is quite a surprise. Hello, Annie. Hello, Mrs. Krausheimer. I didn't know whether you'd remember me. What are you doing in New York? Oh, I'm here on business. How's your wife? She's fine, thanks. And how's Bertha? She's fine, too. Married to a dairy farmer in Boise. Got 4 children. All girls. Well, good for Bertha. Sit down, won't you, and have some tea. No, thanks. I got a lot to do. Only dropped in for a second. Certainly makes me feel good to meet somebody from our neck of the woods. Say, this is quite a city. Every night's Saturday. Annie, you haven't changed a bit from the little girl who used to go running in and out of the house. I'd of recognized you in a minute. Why, Harry Deever, that's the nicest thing you could have said to me. I did recognize you. Only saw your picture on your husband's desk, and recognized you right off. Say, he's a good-looking fellow. What were you doing with my husband? Well... You know, Beecham is on the other side of the river. And it was always incorporated in Brender county... Between 1936 and now, you're not legally married. Why, that's terrible. Oh, it's nothing. I gave your husband his $2 back and he don't lose a cent on the whole thing. You just get married again. I should hope so. Now, mother, don't get excited. It's really nothing, Mrs. Krausheimer. Nothing? How does it look? Well, now, mother, don't worry. David will do all right by your little girl. How do you know? Because David's already called up and wants us to have dinner for 2 at momma Lucy's. He'll marry me tonight. I hope so. Can I drive you somewhere, Mr. Deever? Oh, thanks, Mrs. Krausheimer. I'd appreciate it. Give my love to Bertha and those 4 girls. Thanks. and good-bye, Annie. Good-bye. I do hope everything will be all right. Mother, what are you talking about? Well, you call me up if anything happens. If nothing happens. Now, don't worry, darling. Good-bye. Good-bye. Uh, Lily? You know that little bolero suit that's hanging in the closet? Yes, ma'am. Well, I was married in that suit and I want to wear it tonight. Isn't that wonderful? Well, you know that better than I do, ma'am. Well, get it, Lily. Inhale, Mrs. Smith. Inhale. I can't understand anything hanging in a closet shrinking so much. How are you, Mrs. Smith? Fine. Fine. Mrs. Smith's here. Hello, darling. I thought you weren't going to buy any more new clothes. You look kind of cute. Oh, you know, I can't wait to see momma Lucy's. Uh, do you think we'll get the same table? Oh, sure. It'll be covered in a checkered tablecloth and there'll be a candle in an old Chianti bottle. And Rosa, the fortune teller. You know, I even love the smell of the place. Either our noses have changed, or they've built a livery stable around here somewhere. Well, it's not exactly Chanel 5. Let's go in. The place has changed a little. Customers. Is momma Lucy here? I'm momma Lucy. Uh, you've changed a little, too. She went back to the old country. Uh--uh, wait a minute. We'd like to eat here. You want to eat here? Yes, if you haven't any objections. You got no objection, I've got no objection. Where you like to sit? Well, we used to come here years ago and there used to be tables outside. Would it be too much trouble to have it the way it used to be? Are you going to have a 45 cent or a 65 cent dinner? 65. Ok. Tablecloth isn't checkered. It's dirty enough so it looks checkered. Candle stuck in a beer bottle isn't the same, is it? Haven't they ever seen anybody eat before? Let's just out-stare them. That'll make them embarrassed. Eat your soup, dear. There's something wrong with that soup. It's your imagination. Why doesn't the cat eat the soup? Animals know what's good for them. You notice he ate the olives. The pits, too. Well, that's roughage. Make the best of it, darling. Don't let it spoil our evening. That cat knows something. Where shall we go after this? Home. Home? Well, aren't we supposed to go someplace before we go home? All together, it would make it too late. I'd give 5 bucks to see that cat take a sip of that soup. David? Yes, dear? Tell me what you do a day in the office. You know, just a simple day like today. From the time you came in till you went home, what happened? Oh, uh... Just a lot of smooch. It's duller than dishwater, really. Oh, no, it isn't. I'm very interested. What sort of things go on in a day? Who did you see? Please try and remember. Well, now, let me see. Oh, yes, yes, yeah. Some sucker came in and wanted his alimony reduced. Another guy came in and wanted me to rub out a name in his grandmother's will. And, uh, that's about all. I spent most of the day in conference with Jeff. Things pile up in 3 days. Wonder if he'll take a little soup? Come on. No. No, he won't. Doesn't that mean something? I want a stomach pump. Waiter: nice cat, eh? Yeah. I'm unlucky with cats here. The third cat this week. They get run over... [Relieved sigh] I think. Your name Mrs. Smith? Yes. How did you know? Your mother is in the kitchen. On the phone. Oh. Well, it must be about our red cross group. Hello. Mother? [Hushed] not exactly. He's teasing me. He thinks he's being romantic about it. Mother, are you crying? Oh, my poor baby. Thank heaven your father is dead. Listen to me now. Under no conditions-- do you hear me-- are you two to... Why, mother! Of course not. Yes, mother. If worse comes to worse, I'll spend the night with you. Oh, good night, my love. Good night. Everything all right? Yes. Darling, I have a little secret to tell you. Oh, it's about time. What is it, dear? You're a great kid. It's...getting rather late if we have to go anyplace, if you know what I mean. I get it. Waiter, check. [Whistling] Glasses, dear. Glasses? Don't want to drink out of the bottle, do you? Get going, Annie. Keep twirling it, honey. [Whistling] [Crash] You beast! You know we're not married. You were never going to tell me. I was going to tell you, Annie. I was going to tell you later. Later? How much later could you have told me? Now there's no need in going on like this. You were going to wait until... Annie. And then throw me aside like a squeezed lemon. "Squeezed lemon." Don't dramatize this. I've given you the best years of my life, and you were willing to go on and on. I've always had a suspicion about you. So did my mother. Your forehead slants back too much. Will you please let me say some-- don't touch me. But, Annie, I-- get out of here. Go on. Go on. You're not staying here. But we can't leave the bedroom until after we've made up. You're not in the bedroom. Get out! Annie, listen to me. I know you for what you are. I'm lucky I found you out. You're going out of here. Those are my clothes. Never come back. I never want to see you again as long as I live. Dear, what are you doing? Good evening, Mr. Smith. Good evening, Thomas. Have you a room for a member who pays his dues? I'm sure we have. Quite a novelty seeing you, sir. Don't remember your having spent a night here in 3 years. There you are, sir. Hey. Look out. Are you hurt? Hello, Smith. Hello. Benson. Chuck Benson. Don't you remember me? You and I played together in a foursome in last year's golf tournament. Yeah. How are you? Fine. How are you? Oh, well, I've got kind of a little crick in my neck, and I thought this might work it out. Uh-huh. Yeah. I had a fight with my wife, too. It wasn't exactly a fight. You know what I can't understand? Whenever 2 people have a fight, the woman always goes home to her mother. But when my wife and I have a fight, I have to get out of the house. Huh. How do you get back? Simplest thing in the world. Ignore it. Ignore the whole thing. The next day, they're dying to see you. Take it from me, brother. I've had experience. Yeah. You're right. Just go to the office, don't even telephone, she worries why don't I come back. And when I do get back, why... Thank you, Joe. Yes. What can I do for you? What can you do for me? What's this? A chain to keep people out. Well, open it up. Miss Krausheimer's not at home. Miss Krausheimer's not at home. I'm going to come in and wait. You open that up, or I'll fire you. You're not firing me. I was the midwife for Annie when she was born. I know how you've been acting towards her, and all I can say of what she's done is it's about time. Hey! What about my pen? Thank you for a wonderful evening. Gentleman: I'll take you upstairs. Oh, no, no. That's quite all right, Mr. Flugle. I had a wonderful time. I did, too, miss Krausheimer. Good night. Good night. Oh, no, no, no, Mr. Flugle. Well, they can't rule you out for trying. That's right. Good night. Better luck next time. Good night. Open that door. I know you're in there. Oh, now this is ridiculous. I saw you downstairs with that old goat. Open that door. I'm not gonna stand for this. There's your pen. Annie, you open that door. When they come back a second night, things are bad. Go on, go on. Now. Now what? Are you going to stop this silly farce, or aren't you? I've got a lot of work piled up for me at the office. I've just been through a 3-day session of this nonsense, and I haven't any more time for these games of yours. You can come home now, and I'm willing not to discuss it anymore. That's very generous of you. Who do you think you're talking to? My wife. We're not married. Are you out of your mind? Certainly we're married. What do you mean after 3 years we're not married? Legally, we're not married. Oh, for--all right, we'll get married. Does that satisfy you? "We'll get married." That's a nice, snarly proposal. Listen here. You had a hard enough job to get me to marry you before, and I didn't know you. But I do now, and how I know you. And if anyone asks you, you're no bargain. Well, what's the matter with me? I don't want this discussion to run into hours. I'm very busy. Name one thing about me you don't like. One thing. My, aren't we vain? One thing I am not is vain. What about that tar stuff you keep rubbing in your hair that smells up my whole bedroom? I am only trying to save my hair for you. And you're a fine one to talk-- going to bed with those aluminum clips in your hair. You turned over one night and cut me in 20 places. You needn't worry. You won't be cut anymore. I'm not gonna stand any more of this, and that's my final word on the matter. Nice to have met you. I'm not going to support you. What do you think of that? Fine. No. I mean it. You're not gonna get any more money. Who asked you? I want you to know that I'm doing this reluctantly. Suits me. Keep the change. You're not being very practical. How do you think you're going to live? I said, how do you think you're going to live? Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Hey, where you going, bud? Are you looking for something? Yes. Can I help you? Yes. You take this aisle here, and I'll-- no, no. It's all right. I'll find it myself. I might be able to save you a lot of trouble. I'm very well acquainted with the merchandise. No. I'd just rather run across it myself. Something in lady's lingerie? Yes. Yes, something in lady's lingerie. Well, that's-- don't tell me. It's a game I'm playing. That's perfectly all right. I see you. You might as well come up. Anything I can do for you, sir? Are you crazy? Will you please do me a favor and come home? I'm supposed to be in court this morning. Well, I'm sorry, sir. I think you have the wrong department. We have nothing here for you. Are you gonna come out of here peacefully, or will I have to carry you? And the most wonderful feature of these, you don't have to launder them. You merely throw them away. Just throw them away. That suits me. Oh, no. Leave me alone. Don't you-- why, miss Krausheimer, what are you doing to the customer? I'm not doing anything. Look who's got who. I'll have to ask you to release our sales clerk. Do you want to try and make me release her? If you're not pleased with this clerk, I'll be happy to get you another. I'm pleased with her, all right, but she's no clerk. She's my wife. Your wife? I am not. Miss Krausheimer, we understood you were a single woman. As an aid to the unemployment crisis, it is our policy not to employ married women. And quite right, too. I am not married. She's married, all right. We'll have to take this up with the head of the firm. Well, just take me to him. Let's all go. This way, please. Oh... This gentlemen claims he's married to our miss Krausheimer. We are not married. We're married, all right. You understand, miss Krausheimer, it is not our policy to employ married women. I told her that. I tell you we are not married, Mr. Flugle. She's married. Where did you meet this monkey? Sylvia introduced me to him. That's the last time I want you to talk to Sylvia. I never liked her very much in the first place. Mr. Flugle, I tell you I am a single girl. She is not, you old goat. And what do you mean by taking out innocent girls the night before you give them a job in this dump? I am not innocent. There you are. She admits it. She's my wife. I didn't admit anything. Are you referring to me as an old goat? Oh, sit down. The store detectives. I'll get the store detectives. Yes. I'll get the store... Well, are you satisfied now? I have an appointment at the office. Will you make up with me? No. I'm not going to make up with you ever. For heaven sake, Ann, what is the matter with you? In the morning, I said that if I had to do it all over again, I wouldn't want to marry you. And now I have a chance to do it all over again, and I want to come back. Doesn't that convince you that I want to stay married to you? Oh, I believe that you want to get married again, and I'm very flattered, but I don't want to marry you. I've thought it all over, and I'm not interested. Well, what's the matter with me? Well, I don't like your temper. You're jealous. You're always knocking people down. If you are referring to new year's Eve, I don't think that that drunk had any right to pick up your garter and wave it around. It wasn't my garter. I showed you both my garters. That was after you'd gone into the ladies room and gotten Julie's garters. They were my garters. They were Julie's garters. How do you know they were Julie's garters? I know they weren't your garters. I don't know what you two are selling, but do you have a license to get this crowd around? What do you mean, license? Run on about your business. Go on and hit him, why don't you? Knock him down. Go ahead. Madam, I wouldn't advise your friend to strike an officer in this town. Well, officer, I'm on your side. I don't even know this man. Oh. Beat it, buddy. Come on, you go this way, and you go visit Columbus circle. Now wait a minute. Go on, scatter. Break it up. Wait just--you can't do this to me. [Knock on door] Come in. Hello, David. Hello. I postponed the Amanda case for you and set back the Duffy hearing and asked for a continuance against the streetcar company. That's fine. That's just fine. I'd like to ask you to do something, David. I'll get my work cleaned up in no time at all. I can't seem to get my mind on it right now. Oh, that's all right, David. You don't know what I'm going to ask you yet. Sure. Anything you want. You know. I'd like to have you drop in at your own home tonight. After dinner. What do you mean? Well, I took matters in my own hands and asked Ann to have me to dinner. She's fond of me, and she knows I'm fond of her. Well, I think I can straighten this thing out. I hope it is something I can straighten out. Oh, yeah. It's nothing at all. It's just a little marital quarrel. It's nothing at all, really. Mm, I imagined it was that. You're too fine to do anything shoddy. Well, now I'd like to have you just drop in unannounced at, shall we say, uh, 9:00. Jeff, I... That's all right. You're the best friend a man ever had. We're partners. You're the best partner a man ever had. We were school chums. You're the best fullback that Alabama ever had. I thought Henkel was great... But Henkel couldn't touch you. Thanks, David. May I come in? I'll see. It's all right. Hello, Ann. David, I want you to talk to my lawyer. Your lawyer? Mm-hmm. What lawyer? Ann has asked me to represent her in this matter, David. Oh, what for? I've been telling her she doesn't need a lawyer. I'll say she doesn't. She just told me all about it, and as I understand the facts of the case, you two aren't married at all. There you are. What? So there's nothing for the court to decide. This happened before in Peterson vs. Peterson, and Jeff said they even threw it out of the supreme court. Hey, what's the matter with you? And he said you're lucky it isn't the south and that I'm not his sister. Why, you hillbilly ambulance chaser. Now there's no need to lose our temper. We're married. If not legally, then by common law. That's just as good. It's better. Oh, I don't deny there's a kind of common law relationship between you. Tell him the whole thing, Jeff. However, the woman is given the benefit of any difficulties arising out of such relationship. For instance, should you die, as a wife, she's entitled to share in the husband's estate. That's great. When I die, she'll get the furniture. Now you're entitled to hold yourself forth as the husband. I am holding myself forth as the husband. I wish you'd tell me something I don't know. Should the woman, however, care to halt the relationship and marry someone else, she's entitled to do so. Peterson vs. Peterson, Adams vs. Kelly, and Gimbel vs. New Pennsylvania coal company. You are supposed to be my best friend, and you're telling her this. Now, David, I have never taken advantage of our friendship by word or deed, and it's only because you're standing here that I can now ask Ann. Would you care to have dinner with me tomorrow night? Ann, I'm asking you to come to your senses and marry me tomorrow. If you have dinner with him tomorrow night, this is final-- we're through. What time? We're through. From now on, we're just friends. That's not necessary. Is the Florida club all right? Anywhere you say. Jeff: I'll call for you at 8:00. Ann: that'll be fine. Good night, Jeff. Good night. Good night, Ann. Good night. Good night. Good night. Comparing yourself to Henkel as a football player. You couldn't carry Henkel's water bucket. Good night, David. You understand? Yes, sir. Ann: who is it? Oh, Mrs. Smith, could I see you a moment, please? Just a minute. Good night, David. Your nose is bleeding. Are you sure that stuff is good for a nosebleed? Best thing in the world. I always use it. Then, I don't know. I use it for everything. Oh, yeah. Oh, boy. I guess I am a kind of a dummy. Eh-heh. The last thing in the world I should do is chase her. Leave her alone for a week or 10 days. Eh-heh. She's used to me. She can't get to sleep until I get home. Hmm. I'll have fun for a couple of nights, play a little poker with the boys. Gloria? Oh. I thought there was a woman in here. Hiya, Gloria. Uh-huh. And I'm kissing you back. Mmm... [Kiss kiss] Jimmy? This is no Jimmy. This is chuckie. Uh-huh. Been missing your Chuckie, honey? She's a wonderful girl. Society girl-- real class. How about tomorrow night? Atta-girl. Listen, I got a friend. How about Gertrude? You'll like Gertrude. Me? Gertrude? Oh, he's a wonderful fella. Society fella-- real class. Did you ever see the girl in the camel advertisements? Is she as good looking as that? Oh, Gertrude. Say, I got a nice little dinner partner for you tomorrow night, but he kinda needs cheering up. Know what I mean? Ok. She wants to talk to you. Hello? She's kissing at me. Kiss back at her. I don't know her. Well, it's all for a laugh. She's a great kid. [Kissing] It feels kinda silly. Huh? Well, how do you know you're crazy about me? Oh. Oh, it's just an ordinary voice. I used to sing a little. Didn't I tell you? Yeah, he's a great fella. 8:00? What'll we make it? The Florida club. How about the Florida club? Ok. Good-bye. Wait till you see 'em. Wait till you see 'em. What has Gertrude got to do with camels? She smokes 'em. Yeah, but you said something about the advertisements. Heh? Oh, well, she looks like that girl. She's a dead ringer for her. She likes my voice. That isn't all she'll like. Yes, I'll take care of that, Mr. Rondell. I'll do the best-- I'll be there in a minute. Um, Mr. Chuck Benson's party. Oh, yes, sir. They're expecting you. Right this way. [Big-band swing music plays] Not there, Davey! Not there! Over here, Davey! Davey, my boy! The one and only. Here he is, kids, in the flesh. What's been keepin' ya? Well, hello there. Chuck: what's held you up, Davey? The girls have been waiting here for you for more than an hour. I've been a little busy at the office. Oh, no, no! Not there. That doesn't go there. Keep your hands off of Gloria. This is Gertie here. No, no, right here is where the chair goes. Gloria o'day and Gertie Schultz, this is Davey Smith. How do you do? Hi. What are you gonna have to drink, Davey? Why don't you try an old-fashioned, Davey? Yeah, have an old-fashioned. Hey, waiter, bring us another old-fashioned. Uh, uh...Couldn't-- isn't it a little crowded in here? Couldn't we go someplace where it was quieter, maybe a little darker? No, hold it, cookie. We'll go to one of them dark, romantic places later. We're eatin' first. You ever been here? Oh, yes, often. That's why I... Wanted to go someplace where it was darker. I don't get it. It's awfully hot in here. I know a place that's very cool. Don't rush it. We're stuck for the cover charge anyway. Say, Davey, a couple more hours of this... I beg your pardon. The pheasant, madame. Dish it out, I'm starved. I could eat a horse. Don't forget to take the feathers off. This'll be right here, honey. David's here. Yes, so I see. Who's he with, I wonder? Well, so you wanna wrestle, huh? [Not making any sound] She's rather pretty, isn't she? Do you know her, Jeff? No, I don't. I want to dance. Oh, fine. Do you care to dance, dear? Yes, indeed. You're looking for trouble, buddy. You know what this pheasant is? Nothin' but chicken, and tough chicken at that. 3 bucks for this with a couple of French fries. What a racket. Uh, Gertie doesn't seem to like the food here. Maybe we better go somewhere else. It's gettin' better. You gotta work on it a little. Relax. Relax. Gloria: no, I think Gertie's right. We still should've ordered some chop suey. Chuck: what's the matter, baby? Don't you like pheasant? Gloria: no, I like some chop suey. Just pour some ketchup on it. Hey, waiter! Bring us some ketchup. But I don't like ketchup. Then scrape the gravy off. That ought to fix it. Well, I still think we should've ordered some chop suey. Aw, just eat it up, honey. Then maybe Davey'll invite us over to his house. Yeah? Oh, swell. Yeah. Eat it up. All right. [Nasally] my nose has started bleeding. I gotta go home again. Aw, that's all right. I can stop a nosebleed. No, no, wait a minute. Just lie right down. Oh, sure. No! Hey, chum, gimme a hunk of ice, will ya? Here you are. No. No, no, no, no. Just take it easy. I know how to stop that. I used to fix 2 of these a night at the dance hall. Gertie, why don't you try a cold knife under his nose? Good idea. David: let me up. Don't talk. Hey, waiter. Put that chicken back on the stove, will ya? It's nothing at all, folks. Just stand back and give him some air. Gloria: maybe he should've ordered chop suey, too. I knew the way he was acting he was gonna get a punch in the nose. Gloria: maybe he saw something that made him dizzy. Come, Ann. Hey, give me another knife. This one's hot. Just cut my throat with it. If you're upset, I'll gladly take you home. Upset? Why? Because I saw David with Florence nightingale? I don't care who holds a knife to him, although I'd certainly like the chance myself. Well, uh... Is there someplace you'd like to go? Yes. I feel like staying up all night tonight. I know. Let's go to the fair. Good idea. I've never been so happy in all my life. Wonderful evening. [Thud] [Nervous giggle] [Thud] This is wonderful. So happy and carefree. [Thud] ooh! [Silence] Uh-oh. [Nervous laugh] You know, they're being very clever. They're making believe we're stuck. We are stuck. That's what I thought. Why don't they do something about it?! Keep calm, Ann. Don't be frightened. It's much better to stay where we are. You're soaked through. It's nothing. [Sniffles] You're catching cold. It's only a little sniffle. Ah-choo! You know what David does if he sneezes twice in one evening? He goes to bed with 4 hot water bottles, a quart of Brandy, and a red woolen cap over his head. You ought to see him in bed with that red woolen cap. The moment we get down we'll go to your apartment and get you into some dry clothes. My apartment? Mmm. Excuse me. Ah-choo! What a beautiful room. No wonder you've never gotten married. Who did it for you, Jeff? I did it myself. Do you like the color scheme? You did? David couldn't even tell you the color of our walls. He could be living in a tent. It's the most tasteful man's bedroom I've ever seen. Thank you. Uh, what about your hair? Oh, don't worry about it. I'll just dry it in front of the fire. Well, would you excuse me? I'm going to get into something more comfortable. [Door opens] Well, is that your idea of something more comfortable? Well, I only have one dinner coat. Don't tell me you expect to go out again in your condition. Well, this hasn't been much of an evening for you. Don't you ever think about yourself? What you need, young man, is a little medical attention. Oh, I feel fine, Ann, really. 2 big swallows of this, there'll be one less pneumonia case tomorrow. Now you sit. Sit right over there. Is that for me? Yes. all in one big gulp. I don't drink liquor. I just keep it for David... And friends. You mean you never drink liquor at all? I haven't anything against other people drinking it, mind you, but I just never seem to get around to breaking training. I eat 4 different vegetables a day. Really? You know, when I was a young fella, I attended a temperance lecture, and it was very instructive. I've never forgotten it. Now, this man was explaining the evils of liquor, and there was a drunk in the audience who kept interrupting him. Finally, the lecturer asked the drunk to come up on the platform. When he got there, he asked him to open one eye. And do you know what he did? He took an eyedropper full of whiskey and squirted it into that man's eye. Well, you never heard such hollering in all your life. Of course, his whole eye got inflamed, and the lecturer pointed out that the lining in your stomach is exactly the same composition as your eyeball. Well, sir, I've never been able to forget that. It's rather a dirty trick. Then you know what happened? The drunk left the hall and came back a few minutes later and went up on the platform and asked the lecturer to open his eye. And do you know what he did? What? He jammed a whole handful of cone crinkles in that man's eye and turned to the audience and said, "that's what cone crinkles do to the lining of your stomach." Well, it served him right. Ah-choo! Well, this isn't alcohol, Jeff, it's medicine. Well, if you think I ought to. Yes, I do. One big gulp now. Well, don't you feel it? Doesn't it burn you or anything? No. I've tried this before, and it's very interesting. I don't mind the taste of it. Only thing is my metabolism must be very high 'cause I'm sorry to say I'm not one of those strong, silent men who can hold their liquor. I never saw anyone hold it as well. I don't think one is going to do you any good. I think another one would be a mistake. It's just medicine. It kills the germs. All in one gulp now. Your good health. What a constitution. Uh-oh. [Hiccup] Maybe that second one was too much. Miss Ann... May I beg your leave for a moment? Certainly. Jeff, are you feeling all right? Now you come right over here and sit down. I wouldn't want to get bold. We'll keep the table between us. That's right. Right over here. You sit right there. I'll sit right over here. My only fear is that I may not act like a gentleman. Well, I always say that a man's true character comes out when he's had one drink too many. Do you want to know the basic difference between you and David? You give him one too many, and he tilts forward at you. And you, Jeff, you lean backwards. Thank you. I'll tell you something else. All evening I've been waiting for just one little suspicious move from you. There isn't one man in a thousand who wouldn't take out a girl in my position and just try something. No matter how faint, it would still be something. And look how wonderfully you're acting. Thank you. Very first time I went out with David, he ruined a brand-new $85 dress I had. He was just awful. Didn't change the whole first year we were married. I used to think maybe it was the things he ate. I tried changing his diet around and everything. Thank you. I had a wonderful evening, Jeff. I'm going to leave you now. You cover up warm in bed and get a good night's sleep. You'll feel much better in the morning. I intend taking you home, Ann. Oh, absolutely not, Jeff. Thank you. Good night, Jeff. Good night, Ann. You're probably dying to kiss me and haven't got the nerve. That's true. You may. I have a cold. That's very considerate. Thank you. That's another basic difference between you and David-- colds never stopped him. He had the measles once. How I didn't get the measles I'll never know. Good night, Jeff. Good night, Ann. Here we go again. I hope she's not going to visit her mother out on long island again. I don't think so. My wife don't like me to do this. This is like driving private. I don't get any freedom. You get paid, don't you? You owe me some more money. I gave you 20 bucks day before yesterday. You used that up 2 days ago. I'll pay you later. Don't lose her. How did you ever become a private detective anyway? My whole family are private detectives. This must be costing her husband a pile of dough. You want to hear my opinion? What? You ain't going to catch her at anything. She's pretty foxy. Oh, I don't know. You know what we ought to do, you and me? What? Let's go to a burly-q show. This dame ain't going to do nothing this afternoon. In the afternoons is when you catch them. No kidding? That's funny. What is? Where does my wife go every afternoon? Hey, look. Look. She's going to visit me. Oh, good morning. Good morning. There's someone waiting for you in the office. That's perfectly all right. Well, Mr. Smith, it's about time. Oh, how do you do, Mr., uh... You've even forgotten my name. I'm a client of yours. I paid you $1,000 retainer fee to sue my brother-in-law. My name is Conway. Yes, of course, Mr. Connolley. Won't you sit down? I made up my mind I was going to see you if it took me all week, and it has taken me all week. Where have you been? Just relax, Mr. Connolley. We've got your brother-in-law right where we want him. If you'll lie down there for a minute, I'll get the files on the case. My name is Conway. I've been sleeping here so much I can't sleep at home. Where did my wife go? She's in Mr. Custer's office. Mr. Custer's parents surprised him. Well, the truth is we're going to lake placid. We've always talked about spending a vacation in the snow, and now we're going to do it. But we didn't know there'd be nearly 2 hours between trains. Is there no chance that you 2 can join us? Well, I-- they're all in there? Yes. But what about Mr. Conway? Hello, Jeff. Oh, excuse me. Um, about poor old Conway. His brother-in-law has him where it hurts, and I've been thinking about it a great deal. Why, you're David Smith. Jefferson's partner. David Smith, my parents. Oh, how do you do, sir? I'm glad to see you. The pleasure's all mine, sir. We know so much about you. Jefferson's just written and written. You're like one of the family. This is Mr. Smith, Jefferson's partner. Miss Ann Krausheimer. We met some time ago. Yes. We know one another very well. Of course. You've probably seen a great deal of her. Yes, I have. A great deal. I hope I'm not interrupting anything. Sit right down, boy. We'll all get acquainted at once. Mother and I have just met miss Ann, and we find out now they're both mighty sweet on each other. Ashley. David probably knows it better than we do, don't you, David? Oh, yes, yes, of course. If it hadn't been for me, they'd never even gotten together. Mrs. Custer: That's so romantic. Any of your family from the south? Well, no, not exactly, but I had a relative in the civil war who didn't fight at all. He was a slacker. A great many northerners saw it that way, ma'am, and I give them credit. Mrs. Custer: You know what I was thinking? What, Mrs. Custer? If 2 people wanted to go on a honeymoon, they could just take the boat to New Orleans and motor right up through the south to our home. A boat's a wonderful place for 2 people. That wouldn't be very good-- excuse me. That wouldn't be very good for Ann. You remember how sick you were the time we took that night boat to Albany. She's not a very good sailor. And I can give you some good practical advice on that, too. Whenever she gets on a boat, don't let her have anything to eat even if she wants to. Just put her to bed and put a hot water bottle on her stomach and hold it there no matter how she hollers. That settles her stomach. He considers himself quite a medical authority. Yes. How do you like New York, Mrs. Custer? Oh, fine. It's so big, though, with everybody rushing around. Well, I'm afraid that's rather deceiving. We're really one big happy family here. Of course, there are a thousand and one little things that go on underneath the surface-- oh, that reminds me. What about my laundry? I haven't any more shorts. Uh, Ann kind of took care of his things around the house. Little household things. And one of the best housekeepers you ever saw. I suppose you're wondering about us. Well, it's quite simple. I've known Ann for a long time and wanted to marry her. Still do, as a matter of fact, but--well, fortunes of war. Oh. I see. Let me tell you something. I know of no finer compliment that I could pay to any girl than to tell you this-- when a man has been sitting across the breakfast table from the same woman for 3 solid years and still wants to marry her, well, she's quite a girl. Jefferson, may I see you in private, please? Come, mother. Excuse us, please. Certainly. Excuse me a minute, Ann. Uh, we can go in here, father. In here, Jefferson. What kind of white trash is this you've taken up with? Father, I know it sounded very confusing. I wasn't confused at all. What's she doing with a hot water bottle on her stomach? And sending his shorts to the laundry? 3 years' breakfast? Well, they had a very peculiar relationship. Were they married? Not exactly. Not exactly? I thought so-- [rattling] The plumbing isn't very good in this building. Now, you mustn't jump to any conclusions about Ann. Are you satisfied now? Are you satisfied to take 2 fine people like that whose whole lives are wrapped up in their son and make them unhappy? What about me being unhappy? All you ever think about is yourself. I can't see how you could have been associated with Jeff for so long and not gotten some of his fine qualities. What's fine about them? Well, he's kind and simple and gentle. Oh, you're in one of your romantic moods again. That's been the trouble since the beginning. And since when have you been so crazy about the gentle act? Shall I recall to you how I got this? A bed lamp. When you get to know Ann, you'll find that she's everything a man wants in a wife. [Rattling] Can't you get an office with better plumbing? Now, mother, I'm going to bring Ann up to lake placid next weekend to visit you. Maybe we're being too hasty, Ashley. We'll make reservations for the children for next weekend. I don't want to seem too harsh, mother. All right, Jefferson, we'll try and forget all this. [Rattling] How do you do? How do you do? Is it too late to go skiing? If you hurry, you can get a couple of hours in after lunch. We'll hurry. Just make an "X," Jeff. Oh, Mr. Custer, I have a message for you from your parents. They're on our excursion trip to the lake. The group won't be able to get back until later tonight. The snow has blocked all the roads. I see. Well, uh, what floor are we on? You're rooms are not in the lodge. Well, I thought they were. They were changed to one of the cabins. That's funny. Well, I'm sure you'll find it very satisfactory. There's more privacy, and a great many people prefer that. That'll be all right, Jeff. Well, how far is it from here? It's only half a mile, and the sleigh brings you back and forth for meals. It gives you quite an appetite. Uh, they're not connecting rooms, are they? No, they're separate suites. Well, I guess we better stay here for lunch before we go. Yes. Boy, they'll be in cabin McKinley. Yes. yes. Each cabin is named after a president. How very patriotic. Hmm, clean, cold air. I love the smell of snow. No one can smell snow. I can. It isn't snow. Those 2 bags go in one room and the rest in the other. Yes, sir. Pardon me. Hmm... Brrr! Don't catch cold now. There you are, boys. Thank you, sir. Telephone when you want to go to dinner. The sleigh will be here in a few minutes. That'll be fine. The sleigh service is discontinued after 10:00 at night. So are the telephones. We try to make this a real retreat. Well, that suits me. A man has no right to ask anything more beautiful. Oh, look. Someone else has the other suite. I'm glad of that. Well, on with our skis. Why, it's David. What are you doing here? Oh! Oh, he's fainted. What happened to him? He's terribly ill. He's got quite an even pulse. Well, don't let him soak here. Carry him inside. Oh, yes. Go easy, Jeff. Easy, Jeff. Ann, would you hold his arms? Well, but you-- no, no, his... His arms. Then maybe I can do it. Let me see now. Well, Ann, you hold his legs, huh? That's fine. Too heavy for you, honey? No. I guess I better go first. Oh, easy, Jeff. One step, honey. Set his legs down, honey. Now... Let's rest a minute. All right? Yes. All right. Now we got him. I better go first. Mind the stairs, now, honey. That's fine. Careful. That's a girl. In here, Jeff. In here. Right here. Ooh! I better go. Hang on. Swing. 1... 2... 3. This is his room. He doesn't seem to be breathing, Jeff. Don't worry now, Ann. Control yourself. He's frozen. He's blue with cold. He's breathing fine. Maybe he ought to have a little Brandy. No, I'm afraid not. I think that's what did it. Yes, I can see he's been at it all week. I think a few hours' sleep will bring him around. Do you really think so? Mm-hmm. We'd better get these wet clothes off him. Come on now, old man. Oh, that's fine. We will go away the first 2 weeks in December. The first 2 weeks in December. What's he saying? We were supposed to come here the first 2 weeks in December. You'll be crazy about it, Ann. Well, he must have been here the whole week torturing himself. He--he shouldn't have come here. Playing in the snow. We'll have a lot of fun. Let's get these wet things off him. Look out! Look out! You'll fall. He thinks we're skiing. You're very graceful, Ann. But don't go so fast the next time. I don't want you to hurt yourself. Isn't that terrible? Look out! Look out for that tree! Ann, I think you better go to your room now. Why? what's the matter? I want to get him undressed. Well, go ahead. Well, I... Oh. Well, if you need me, call me. David: the first 2 weeks in December. If you take a little walk in the snow, you'll feel better. He'll get delirious again and want water. He's sleeping like a baby. There's nothing we can do for him now. I think I'll look once more. [Door closes] He's asleep. [Mumbling] He's trying to say something. The first 2 weeks in December. What's he saying? Oh, he's still at the first 2 weeks in December. He's opening his eyes. Hello, David. Hello, David. Hello, Ann. My, he is in bad shape. Don't you remember me? Try and think, David. This is Ann. Annie. This is Jeff. Your old school chum, Jefferson. I'll never forget you in that little blue dress. That's the dress I was wearing when I first met him. The one I told you about, the one he tore. He liked me in that. I think we ought to let him rest a while. [Gurgling] What's the matter? That isn't a rattle, is it? I don't think so. I wish I could hear it again, though. [Gurgling] No. He's just clearing his throat. He looks awful. He'll look better when he gets a shave. Yes, that's what I was thinking. We'll send for a barber tomorrow. [Water running] Are you expecting me to shave him? No. I can do it. You? Why, Ann, that's something only a barber can do. It's very difficult to shave someone else. I've always shaved him. You shaved him? Mm-hmm. He's going to speak. No. That barber's just ruined his skin. Boy. Boy, I want a shine. He thinks he's in the barber shop. Look. He's lifting his hand. He thinks he wants a manicure. Oh. What shall I do? Maybe we better humor him. Hold it. You think we're doing the right thing? Yes. We mustn't do anything to shock him. He thinks I'm a manicurist, doesn't he? Mm-hmm. He's squeezing my hand. In a few minutes, he'll ask you for your phone number. Will you get me his lotion out of the bathroom? Sure. Sit down, Ann. You know, a woman can't control herself entirely by her head, which is probably why we love you. Now, you and David have had 3 years together, and whether you realize it or not, there's a bond between you, and it's not easily broken. People get divorced. It's true that I think you'd be better off with me, but then I'm prejudiced. My first wish is to see you happy, and it's possible-- it's more than possible-- that as peculiar as David is, you still couldn't be happy without him. Tell you what I'd like you to do-- you take back your promise to marry me and think about it for a few days. If you find you can't go on without David, well, you know I'll wish you every happiness in the world. That's very kind of you. Don't you think we ought to see how he's getting along? We'll only wake him up. I'll go see if he's still asleep. I'll look through the window. [Door opens] I will never forget you in that little blue dress. Little blue dress, eh? You've been found out, you beast. I should've known your being here was all too convenient. Now look here, Ann. Big sympathy act, coming up here and pretending you're all a-bat. But I love you, Ann. Listen to me, David. You pick up and get out of here. I never want to lay eyes on you again. You're just making a nuisance of yourself. Get your hands off me. I don't care what you say. I know you're in love with me. And I know you're crazy. You're mine, and you belong to me. You couldn't have anything to do with that pile of Southern fried chicken. That's what you think. Let me tell you something, Ann. You couldn't let him lay a hand on you. I know you, not after what we've been to each other. He's going to lay a hand on me, and we're going to get married. Ok. If that's the way you feel about it, I won't stand in your way. I've been thrown out of my own home, threatened by cops, chased around in taxi cabs, and neglected my job, only because I loved you and wanted you back again. Now I'm finished. It's all washed up. Go ahead and marry the guy. I hope you'll be very happy. Well, you heard. He liked me in that little blue dress. Jeff, will you marry me? Why, I'd be honored, Ann. You think it's wise to make a decision in anger? Even at a time like this, you could be considerate of him? Your happiness is my only concern. I'm not good enough for you, Jeff. Why, I think you're making me the happiest man in the world. I know what you'd like. You'd like some nice dinner now, wouldn't you? How about some nice Southern fried chicken? Yes. David: hello? Hello? Is that the Porter? What's the first train I can get back to New York? 10:30? All right. Have a sleigh up here half an hour before, will you? [Hangs up phone] [Bells jangle] I thought it was a very nice dinner, didn't you? I wasn't very hungry. Hope he has the decency to leave tonight. Who, David? He won't stay around where he's not wanted. I bet you he'll be gone by the time we get back. You know the real reason he keeps chasing me? He's still so much in love with me. He's such an egotist that he can't bear the idea of letting someone else kiss me. He just won't believe that I'm going to marry you. Well, he'll have to after we're married. Mmm, it's getting colder, Jeff. Could you tell the driver to go faster? Driver, go straight to cabin McKinley and take the short cut, if there is one. You know, I'm worried about him. Who? Oh, David, yes. He may have been putting on an act today, but he'll really take to drinking from now on. Oh, I don't think so. He'll probably find someone else. David's the type that always gets married again. I'm so afraid he'll ruin his life on account of me, spoil a brilliant future. He is brilliant, you know. If I could only make him-- I mean, if I could only disillusion him about me, make him hate me, do something. Yes, if he'd only hate me, that would be the solution. Listen, listen, it would work, too. Those walls are paper-thin, and he could hear everything. Why, Ann, what are you suggesting? Oh, it's a wonderful idea. Hurry, driver, hurry. Yes, ma'am. Giddyup. Shh! Good night, Jeff. Good night, Ann. It's a wonderful thing you're doing. He'd be on my conscience otherwise. Good night, Ann. Come on in, Jeff. It's early yet. Jeff! Jeff! Oh, put me down, Jeff. Put me down this instant. Now, Jeff... Ha ha. Now, you know I've had enough to drink, Jeff, and so have you. Ha ha. [Glass shatters] Oh, Jeff. Oh. Jeff, are you hurt? Shh. Shh. Don't talk so loud. Let me help you up, Jeff. Ohh. Unh. My, aren't you strong? [Ann giggles] Oh. Ha ha ha. Ha ha ha. My, what a heavy shoe it is, Jeff. Jeff! Oh, no. No. Jeff, what are you doing? Unless you stop, Jeff, I'll have to ask you to leave. Jeff, behave yourself. You haven't even got any pride. I only did this for you so you'd realize it was all over between us. There's only one way to handle you. Ooh, let go of me. Let go of me. Jeff! Let go of me. Let go. Jeff! Jeff, I--I'm not acting. This is real. Come in, Jeff. Come in, Jeff! [Struggles] Jeff! Hit him, Jeff. Hit him. I don't need it. Do you want to make anything out of it? I forgive you, David. You mean you're not gonna hit him? You're not gonna hit him? Ann, you're so attractive that I take it for granted that other men, less disciplined, will always take liberties with you. Violence shows a lack of character. You mean you're not going to do anything to him? Would you respect me more if I knocked him down? Would I? You big blubber, what kind of a man are you? How could you be in love with a woman and let someone paw her? Now, Ann, let's not say anything in anger we'll be sorry for. Haven't you any self-respect? Surprise, surprise. Isn't it wonderful up here? Are you children having a good time together? Ann, do you realize you're raising your voice? Huh! raising her voice? Certainly I'm raising my voice. Well, I never saw you act like this before. I always thought you were the gentle type of girl. Very gentle. How do you think I got this? Jefferson, I forbid you to marry this--this woman. You--you forbid him to marry me? Listen to me, you stuffed shirt. Even a mouse has enough backbone to fight sometime. Taking your hat off on that elevator doesn't make a man out of you. You can teach a monkey to do that. And I'll take a mouse or a monkey anytime, whether he's a dipsomaniac or beats his wife for the lump of jelly like you. But I'm not taking you. Why don't you go out and get a girl guide and go camping together? Let me out of here before I forget I'm a lady. You have just seen her in one of her quieter moments. What are you doing? The telephone is disconnected, and there's no transportation, and I'm gonna spend the evening at the lodge. But that's ridiculous. Why don't you spend the night here? Mm-mmm. not on your life. How are you gonna get there? You can't ski. Well, if necessary, on my hands and knees. You're not doing me any favor by staying here. I just as soon you'd get out. We see eye to eye. In fact, I'll help you get out. Ow! Sorry. Thank you. [Door slams] I'm warning you, I'll kill you in cold blood. Sometime, someday, when your back is turned, I'll stab you. I'm telling you, don't you try anything. David, get me out of these things. Get me out of here! David! David, get me out of these! I'll break every bone in your body! David! David, I-- oh. Oh... David... Ohh... David. Oh... David. Captioning made possible by Warner Bros.
