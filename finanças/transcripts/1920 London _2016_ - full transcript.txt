Greetings, Princess. You're my daughter, Shivangi, but do not forget that after marriage your husband's home becomes your home. You informed your in-laws regarding your arrival, didn't you? If I wanted to inform them, I would've written two letters and not one, Mother, but I came here to reduce my troubles, not to increase them. Sikar is not so far from Sajjangarh, sister, that your in-laws won't hear about your arrival. Their daughter-in-law came from London and went straight to her father's home? They won't be happy about it. They have already lost their right to be angry, brother. I'm worried that after hearing the truth, you might also get angry. Don't talk in riddles! You know that I don't like beating around the bushes. She can talk only if you let her, right? Tell me what happened to the prince. Everything was fine till April 21st. Veer had appeared for the law exam. The results were going to be declared soon. When you are with me I don't know What happens to me You make my heart flutter with the look in your eyes Where did you learn This magic trick? I'll follow you like a shadow everywhere What am I without you? Nothing at all I wish, I wish I wish, I wish Wish we may stay oblivious to the time Wish we could stay this way all our life I wish, I wish I wish, I wish I wish, I wish "Greetings, Veer. "You are not only making Sajjangarh proud in London, "but the entire Mewar. "Today, on the day of our annual meet, "please honor us "by accepting this small gift from our province. "Yours faithfully, Subedar Bansari Lal Bismil." If you are with me I have no desire For anything else When you smile In front of me I'll lay my life there for you I'll follow you like a shadow everywhere What am I without you? Nothing at all I wish, I wish I wish, I wish Wish we may stay oblivious to the time Wish we could stay this way all our life I wish, I wish I wish, I wish Darling... Darling? What happened, darling? Aunt Kesar. -Aunt Kesar! -Yes, madam. Aunt Kesar, ask the driver to get the car. -We have to go to the hospital. -Sure, madam. Medical tests were done. Blood samples were sent to a bigger hospital. Before I could ask the doctors about him... Darling! Darling! What's happening to you? What's happening, darling? I'll call... I'll call the doctor. Doctor! Doctor, come quickly. -What happened? -My husband, doctor. Please, doctor. Please come quickly. Oh, my God! Sister, he's having a bad muscle spasm. We must get him out of this state. -Get me lidocaine 20 mg, quickly. -Okay. What is wrong with him, doctor? If I'm not mistaken, Mrs. Veer, your husband is suffering from tetanus. It's a very rare condition. It affects only one in a thousand people. The disease was discovered in Germany by a Japanese doctor, but the medicine for curing it has not yet been found. The doctor was trying to explain, but I couldn't understand anything, except that there is no cure in medical science for the disease he was talking about. The only relief was that after taking the injection, he could sleep and rest for a while. Excuse me, ma'am. There's a call for you from your residence. -George, take me home. -Yes, ma'am. Please hurry up. This is black magic. Doctors cannot cure this. Aunt Kesar, why would anyone perform black magic on a noble person like him? Forget about enmity, he doesn't even raise his voice at anyone. You were born in the land of Ramayana and Mahabharata. You'll find traitors at every nook and corner. The prince's stepmother never loved him, so His Highness sent him away for studies, so that the negativity at home doesn't affect him. But the second queen knew that as long as the prince was safe and sound, her own son can never be the heir to the king's throne. Now that His Highness is old, she played this dirty trick. How dare they try to harm our prince? Come, Surya Pratap, let's go and talk to them. Wait. You can't douse a fire with fire, you need water for that. And this is a fire which is not even visible. Do you really think that you'll go and blame them, and they'll just bow their heads and accept it? We can kill our enemy at any time, but right now, our aim is not to kill anyone but is to save our prince's life. So are we just going to keep mum and do nothing, Father? When did I say that? To give them a fitting answer, we must give them a taste of their own medicine. Get ready to go to Baba. He will surely have an answer for this black magic. Praises to Mahakali. Your Highness, did they bring everything I had asked for? Yes, Baba. Photograph. Baba, why did you ask for this mirror? In plain sight, one can only see a person's image in the mirror. But if we look carefully, then the mirror reflects the entire world. The only difference is that there is another world in this reflection. A world which runs parallel to this world. Usually, the beings of that world are not allowed to come here, and beings of this world are not allowed to go there. But when a spirit breaks the law and enters this world and troubles the people here, then we also have to break some laws to pin it down. But what will you do with this photograph, Baba? This photograph will drag the evil spirit that's torturing Veer, to us. And I'll tie it down with the power of mantras and free Veer forever. Your Highness, that evil spirit is far more powerful than our expectation. I cannot do this, Your Highness. If you don't help us, we'll have no hope. Your Highness, there is only one person in this world who can save the prince's life. And that's the Baba of Mewar, and your family knows him very well. Uncle. Greetings, Princess. Tell me the truth, uncle. What is everyone trying to hide from me? Why doesn't anyone want to go to the Baba of Mewar? Uncle, you've always treated me as your own daughter. For my sake, please don't hide anything from me. Then, listen, Princess. The Baba of Mewar is none other than Jai. Jai Singh Gujjar. Jai? My daughter is getting married in two months. We've tried everything from medicines to prayers. Nothing helped. Now, only you can do some magic. You are older than me. Please do not embarrass me by requesting. Everything will be fine. Whom did you bring to save your darling daughter? Him? You really think he can save the apple of your eye? He himself has spent five years in jail. And do you know for which crime? Pratap Singh, please go outside. Okay, but... Look, you won't be able to bear what's going to transpire here. Now tell me, who are you? Why are you troubling this innocent girl? If you want to know, then listen. I was sitting on the Peepal tree during dusk. And she was returning from the fair. As soon as she lost her way and came on to the dirt road, I fell in love with her. And I took her under my power. Now go back to where you came from. Otherwise, I'll make you pay dearly for it. A convict is going to save this girl with the knowledge he gained in jail? From me? What are you doing? What are you doing? As long as it's in my hand, it's the holy water from the Ganges. But the minute it touches you, it'll turn into acid. Shut your trap and get lost! Leave this girl's body. I'll not leave her! You heard me? I'll not leave her! She's mine, only mine! If she can't be mine, then I won't let her be anyone's. I'll be indebted to you for life, but please accept this small gift from us. I did not learn this skill from my guru to earn money. Your daughter needs these jewels, Pratap Singh, not me. All I need is an invite for her wedding. The royal chariot at a pauper's doorstep? There has to be a reason. Princess Shivangi has come from London. She wants to meet you. I don't care what she wants. But I want you to go back immediately with her message. I don't want to meet your princess. -But... -Enough, uncle. I am requesting you because you are older than me. If you come here again, or even utter your princess' name in front of me, then I won't be able to respect your age. What a dilemma! You don't want to come with me, and I cannot leave without you. I will wait outside. Lies, lies, lies! You've been lying to me for the last four years. The truth is that you don't have the courage to talk to my father. It's not about courage, Shivangi. It's about the mindset of royals about us commoners. I'm not scared of your father. I'm scared of myself. Because I know that I won't be able to bear his rejection. And if Father gets me married to someone else, will you be able to bear that? You stay right here, I'm going to tell Father that I'm ready to marry anyone of his choice. Shivangi! Shivangi! Why are you upset? Don't be so angry with me I can't even breathe without you I don't know why Oh, let me stay Let me stay lost in your love Let me float dreaming about you Let it be please I am the dawn of your night, right? My name is your destiny, right? There is A mark of your lips On my lips On lonely nights I feel proud to be with you I've felt it I know it That you touched me, right? I am the dawn of your night, right? My name is your destiny, right? I am the dawn of your night, right? My name is your destiny, right? What are you looking at? Your lifeline is shorter than mine. It's silly to look for your destiny in some lines on the palm. Don't laugh. If something happened to you, what will I do? If I have to leave you, then I won't be able to go even if I wanted to. Are you mad? Now our lifelines are equal. Now we will live together and die together. I need it Like one needs air To breathe The same way Your presence is a must for me The bond of our love Will stay for ever Like it has stayed for eons, right? I am the dawn of your night, right? My name is your destiny, right? I am the dawn of your night, right? My name is your destiny, right? -You? -Why? Did you come to meet someone else in these caves? What does that penniless shepherd have that we royals don't have? Rana! -If you were not my aunt's husband... -Then? Then how would I have met a beautiful girl like you? You are the only one I like in that huge palace. If a vagrant shepherd stole you from me, then what's the use of being born in a royal family? -Rana! Leave me, otherwise... -Otherwise what? What? You'll go home and tell everyone that you were getting cozy with that rascal shepherd here? For your own good, do as I say. You take care of me, and I will take care of your little secret forever. Jai. Jai, stop! Jai! Jai! Jai! Jai, stop! Jai, don't do this! Jai, leave Rana! Jai! Jai, for my sake, leave Rana. This is royal blood. You'll pay dearly for it. Your Honor, the truth is that Jai Singh and the princess know each other very well and they are friends. Whatever Jai Singh did, he did it in self-defense. It's a lie, My Lord. How can this criminal Jai Singh and the princess be friends? One is a princess and the other one is a shepherd. Their match is impossible. I think we should not waste the court's time with such arguments. So I would like to call upon my next witness, Princess Shivangi. Princess Shivangi, have you ever met Jai Singh before? Please answer in "yes" or "no" for the court. Yes. Is he your friend? Okay, forget it. Can you tell the court what happened that day? Rana Jag Pratap Singh is my uncle. He would never try to harm me. I know Jai Singh. He came to the Palace Court. But he's not my friend. What are you talking about, Shivangi? Tell them honestly what happened with you. You have no right to interrupt the court proceedings. Please speak freely without any fear or hesitation. This man not only troubles me, but he also said that he will not sit still till he wins me over. It's a lie! She's lying! Shivangi, what happened to you? -Silence! Silence! -But, Your Honor, she's... Do not interrupt court proceedings! When Rana Jag Pratap Singh heard about this, he went to him to save the family's honor and to make him understand. But he didn't respect his age or his position, and he attacked him. It's a lie! It's a total lie! Shivangi, why are you doing this to me? Shivangi, why don't you tell them that you love me? Shivangi, look at me! For the sake of our love, Shivangi! Shivangi, look at me and say that you don't love me! Shivangi! This court pronounces accused Jai Singh Gujjar guilty and sentences him to five years rigorous imprisonment. Shivangi. Why did you do this? -Why? -It took me time to realize that the honor of a royal family weighs more than every relationship. Royals must stand by the royals and not with penniless shepherds. Uncle! I told you I will not come! Go away from here! Uncle, I... I know that you don't want to meet me. But only you can help me, Jai. And if he's not freed from the clutches of that evil spirit soon, he will die, Jai. So finally the royals need the help of a penniless shepherd. I know I've wronged you. But why are you punishing an innocent for it, Jai? I beg you, save my husband's life. Please save Veer, Jai. Your love might have been a joke, Shivangi, but my hatred is not a joke! When you didn't care for my love, then why should I care for your love? I've heard that you did not learn this skill for yourself but to help others. Veer is also among those who need you and your skill now. How can you punish someone else for what happened between us? If, instead of me, some other girl had come to you to beg for her husband's life, then what would you have done, Jai? Would you have disappointed her also? If that's the case, then okay. For others, I do it for free. But from you royals, I'll take a hefty price for this. There's nothing more valuable for me than Veer's life. Please come to London with me and save his life. Aunt Kesar. How is he, Aunt Kesar? He's doing fine, right? Please don't go inside, madam. Don't go. What I've seen over the course of one month, how will you be able to take it all of a sudden? Don't go inside. Don't go inside. You won't be able to see him like this. You won't be... You didn't make any mistake in bringing me here, Shivangi. This evil spirit has completely taken over your husband's body. This witch is stealing Veer's life and power. If we don't do something soon, it'll be difficult to save him. We only have one week's time. Then do something, Jai. Do something. Whichever prayer or treatment is required, do it. But please... Please save him, Jai. Please save him. I'll save him, but for that, we'll have to take him home. This is strange. It's your husband, your decision. Whether you want to get him treated here or somewhere else, what say does the doctor have in it? I said the same to him. But the doctor said that he is ready to discharge him from the hospital, but if anything happens to him after that, then I'll be responsible for it. And I'll have to give the same in writing to him. Okay, so what's the problem with that? Today there is no problem, but what if something comes up later? God forbid, if something happens to him, then my in-laws will blame me. There is one way. There is a difference between good and evil spirits. Evil spirits continue thinking about material pleasures even after leaving the body. Especially taste. So to attract evil spirits, sometimes we have to use liquor and meat. Mrs. Veer, we are educated people living in the age of science and medical revolution. I'm shocked that you still believe in black magic. What you're suggesting is, quite frankly, not only nonsensical, it's ridiculous. Please, doctor. Please. You promised me five minutes. Five minutes is all I'm asking you for. Please, doctor. If you insist. What is in that piece of cloth? You will find out, doctor. Please be patient. Now ask him to accompany us to the prince's room. He will believe me after he sees what happens there. Shivangi, you... Wipe your tears, Shivangi. As long as I'm here, nothing will happen to your Veer. Can I see those photographs? If your in-laws have done this, then they cannot do this only with mantras. They must have used some medium to bring this evil here. Think hard. Did you get any eatables from there? Or did someone bring any blessed food, coconut or flowers from them, something which you still have at home? No, I don't remember anything like that. How can this be? Without any medium, from a distance of thousands of kilometers... No. There must be something that you are forgetting. Well, a few days ago, someone sent us a gift from India. Gift? What gift? Who sent it and when? A few days ago, we received a locket by post. A locket? What will happen now, Jai? First, we have to reverse what has already happened. Is there a river or a canal nearby? Yes. The Thames river is about 10 km from here. Now we'll have to wait till night. Night meets dusk at 3:00 a.m. We'll have to immerse this locket exactly at 3:00 a.m. You have memorized the mantras well, right? -Yes. -One mistake can cost us three lives. Your husband's, yours, and mine. You have to fight this battle only for 15 minutes. I will start from here at 9:00 p.m., and at exactly 3:00 a.m., I'll be at the river and immerse this. But till then, you must continue chanting the mantras to pin the evil spirit here. If that doesn't happen, the evil spirit will come after me to try and stop me, and it might succeed, too. I won't let it happen, Jai. Come what may, I will not let it escape from here. Shivangi, I know that you'll try your best, but I also know that the evil spirit will put in double the efforts to escape from here. It will try to scare you, tempt you, and fool you. But under any circumstances, Shivangi, do not stop chanting the mantras before 3:00 p.m. Not even for a second. She's ready, and so are we. Madam, don't stop chanting. Don't stop chanting. Don't worry, madam. I'll get the lantern. George! River! River! Don't stop chanting. Don't stop chanting. Madam, don't stop chanting. Don't stop chanting. Shivangi, why are you hiding there? What happened? Shivangi, what's the problem? Tell me. What is all this? What happened, Shivangi? What happened? Why are you crying? Are you okay? God has answered my prayers. He returned you to me, safe and sound. Send this to London. Will she come? I am her ailment and the treatment. Shivangi will have to come. I beg you, come to London with me. Save my husband's life. Please save Veer, Jai. Princess Shivangi, just like only snake venom can cure a snake bite, Veer's ailment and treatment, both are in this locket. Now no one can save Veer. No one! I made this mistake even though I knew everything. I fell for her trick even after you warned me and stopped chanting the mantras. If I hadn't done that, she wouldn't have escaped and attacked and injured you. I'm not worried about my wounds, Shivangi. I'm only thinking about your husband. I'm not upset that we did not succeed. I'm upset that success slipped away from just an arm's reach. A small... We made a small mistake and we lost everything. If that hadn't happened, we could have saved your husband forever. I have full faith in you, Jai, that you will find another solution and that you can still save Veer. Now I can think of only one solution, Shivangi. Now it's not enough to chop the tree in half. We'll have to uproot it completely. And for that, we need to find out where this evil spirit came from. There are evil spirits and good ones, too. If we want to know the name of the witch, or where she came from, then we have to reach out to a good spirit. This lemon will only stop at the place where it can find a spirit that would help us. I will throw this lemon out of the door, and you will have to go and find it. It sounds easy, but it's not. Because that witch will keep trying to attack you and hide its true self. And if you came back empty-handed, then we will never be able to find her. Are you ready? Shivangi, take care of yourself. And if you feel scared, remember that your friend is always with you. -Madam! -Stop, Aunt Kesar. Neither can you fight this battle, nor I. Only a loving wife can fight this battle. -Sajjangarh? -Yes. You got the same answer that you already knew. What do you mean? It means that this evil spirit has its roots in Shivangi's husband's home. What should I do now, Aunt Kesar? Should I still keep quiet? Should I still think about the family honor and lower my eyes and wait for Veer to die? Then what will you do? I will ask them the price of my husband's life. And even if I have to pay the price with my life, I am ready for that, too. Can one's family do something like this just to gain power? I cannot believe it. I will not leave them, Jai! Stop acting childish, Shivangi. Do you think that you will blame them for your husband's illness, and they will just accept it? They will have to accept it. Don't be crazy, Shivangi. Your in-laws will smartly deny any knowledge about the gift or the Subedar's letter. Shivangi, this is not the right time to argue with them. It's the time to save your husband's life. This lemon told us that the evil spirit has its roots in Sajjangarh. But it doesn't mean that you can go there and cut those roots. Then what should I do, Jai? Should I keep mum and watch the show -even after knowing everything? -No. You just take care of your husband. And I will go there and cut those roots. I will not let that witch succeed, Shivangi. This is my promise to you. I will never forget what you are doing for me. -What is this? -I'm fulfilling my promise. But I haven't completed my job yet. I'll take the payment when my job is done. Jai. Thank you so much. I'm not doing this for you, I'm doing this for myself. I mean, I get great joy by doing this for you. Bye. Waterloo Station, please. Please, hurry up, George. Jai! I never told you the name of the person who sent the locket. Then how do you know that the Subedar from Sajjangarh sent the locket? Your in-laws will smartly deny any knowledge about the gift or the Subedar's letter. I believed that my in-laws are taking out their anger on me. But I didn't know that the person I trusted the most is my biggest enemy. You sent the evil spirit to me, and I kept begging for your help to get rid of it. I held your hand for protection, but you pushed me deeper into trouble. Yes! Because you held my hand for selfish reasons and left it, too, for selfish reasons. I didn't cheat you, you cheated me by accusing me in court, by turning my love into a laughing stock, by showing me my worth. I was convicted for only five years, Shivangi, but I'm still paying for it. That day the judge listened to your testimony, gave the verdict, and robbed me of all my happiness. And I... I heard the testimony of my heart and decided to rob you of all your happiness. I had given the verdict of your husband's death in Sajjangarh. I came here just to seal the deal. And that I did by immersing the locket in the river. I can't tell you, Shivangi, how much joy your tears bring to me. I wanted to see the same pain in your eyes which my eyes felt once. The pain of losing someone you love. Do you think that only you had to bear that pain? Only you were in love? Only you got punished? Do you want to know why I gave false testimony in the court that day? Stop! What are you doing, brother? Such a small punishment for such a big criminal? He tried to hurt our family's honor. We should torture him to death. We should cut the scoundrel into pieces and throw them all around. I would have done the same with you, but what to do, the one who tried to harm my honor is none other than my sister's husband! If I killed you, my sister will become a widow. Rudra, go and kill him! No, brother, no! Don't do this. Don't do this. If he has sinned, then so I have. Punish me, brother. Please do not harm Jai. Please don't do this. Get out of my way! Father, please stop him. Father, please stop him. Please don't kill my Jai. I'll tell him to go away from here. Father... Father, I've never asked you for anything. But please grant my wish for the first and last time. After this, I'll do whatever you say. Please let my Jai go. Please spare Jai, Father! Please spare my Jai. Please grant my wish. Please, Father, grant my wish. Okay. If you don't want me to kill him and want our family honor to stay intact, then you must do what I say. Why didn't you tell me? You think from your heart, and my family thinks with their guns. So someone had to think calmly. My lie would have kept you in jail only for a few years. But the truth... But the truth would have killed you. That's why I did what I felt was right. What did I do? You sacrificed so much to save my life, and I... I tried to kill your husband... No, Shivangi, no. Now, whether I have to fight a witch or God, I promise you, Shivangi, that nothing will happen to your husband. Nothing! Hold this. Give it. Jai! Jai! Jai! Jai. While doing the wrong, I did not realize that when the time comes to do the right, everything will turn wrong. Everything will slip out of my hands. I myself lost control over the evil spirit I sent to subjugate your husband. For the first time I'm feeling so helpless, so powerless. What will happen now, Jai? We have lesser time than we thought. You were right, Shivangi. We really are left with very little time. What will happen now, Jai? How will we save Veer? In such little time, how will we free him from the clutches of that evil spirit? Sometimes we have to go back and fix our mistake to be able to move forward. I'll also have to reverse the clock and go back to my guru. Only he can find a solution now. Do you remember this place? It's the same place where I put my trust in you, where I entrusted you with my knowledge before I passed away. For doing good. To help the needy. Because I knew, Jai, that you are being punished for a crime which you never committed. I was so lost in your innocent eyes, that I forgot to look into your heart, where the fire of hatred and revenge was blazing. I am sorry, guruji. The hatred that I was carrying in my heart was unjustified. I was wrong, guruji. I was wrong. Help me, guruji. I want to right my wrong. What you want to do, Jai, is not easy. Because what you've already done is really dreadful. You awakened a witch, promised to feed her a soul, and now, she won't sleep till she gets that soul. At the moment, she's hunting for Veer's soul. Guruji, only you can help me. I have to save Veer. I have to save Shivangi's happiness. There is one way. Shivangi, guruji gave me the solution. Yes, madam? Ask him if there is any place here which used to be a place of worship, but now no one prays there. What kind of a question is this? How will he answer such a question? Didn't he tell you the name of the place? A new moon night, under the mountains, God's broken abode, that's where we'll find our road. What are you talking about? I'm telling you what my guruji told me. George, is there a place here where people go on a no moonlight night? Like a hill or a mountain? Not that I know of. Wait a minute. There is a place called No Moon Hill. But there's nothing there except a broken-down church. I understood. We have to go there. But what do we have to do there, Jai? -We'll know that after reaching there. -I didn't understand. All I know is that we'll surely get help from someone after reaching there. Let me cry my heart out today You cheated my soul You left me to die My darling Comfort my wounded heart Heal my aching heart Sorry. Let me see your love again My darling Are you my habit? Or are you my addiction? How do I tell you, my love? Let me cry my heart out today You cheated my soul You left me to die My darling I need you to breathe How can one tell you Your eyes have such a sparkle Jai. That my world just lights up My heart is aching for love All it desires is some relief Aching for you is my destiny Why can't I have you with me? George, please stop the car. You are the way and destination, too My darling Let me cry my heart out today You cheated my soul You left me to die My darling Comfort my wounded heart Heal my aching heart Let me see your love again My darling My darling My darling You have come. I was waiting for you. Don't be surprised. It was me you were meant to meet. She already knew that we will come here. Maybe she's the one who will help us. Ask her how can she help us. I'm going to help you by giving you these knives. She can understand our language. I don't understand the language of the body, but I understand the language of the soul. She doesn't understand the language of the body, but she can understand the language of the soul. Ask her what do we need to do with these knives. Veer! Veer! Veer, what happened to you? Aunt Kesar! Veer! In the last 24 hours, I felt his breathing stop at least twice. We have very little time, Aunt Kesar. This knife will tell us how little. But how? What are you going to do? How are you going to do it? I cannot understand anything, Jai. -Did you bring the things I asked for? -Yes. This was what the first knife was for. Now we only have time till this sand runs out. The second knife has also done its job. It has opened the door to the other world for me. As long as the knife is stuck here, this would be the only way between the two worlds. Without this door, neither can I come out, nor can they. Now I'll have to go to that world with the third knife, and I'll have to stick the knife in her. But why in that world? Because in this world, she's just a spirit. But in that world, she has a body, too. And a knife can only attack a body, not the spirit. So I must go there. You mean, if you go there and do this, then everything will become normal? No. I'll have to finish her off in this world. But when I attack her with the knife, she'll be compelled to give us that locket which I had immersed in the river. As soon as I bring that locket here, we'll have to burn it. As soon as the locket is burned, the spirit will also turn into ashes. And as soon as it's done, the prince will be back to normal. But what if the evil spirit comes out and attacks us after you go inside? For that, you'll have to do something. Till I come back, you must hold this coconut tight with both hands, in front of this mirror. And remember, whatever she does, she cannot come outside till you keep this coconut still. So you must not become weak. Keep the fire ready, Aunt Kesar. Come what may, I will bring the locket back. -Veer! -Prince! Prince! Prince. Jai! Veer. Veer? Veer! Veer! Veer! Veer! Veer, you are okay now. You are okay now, Veer. Veer. Shivangi, what happened to you? There's only one way. That witch desires a soul, and she'll not leave without getting a soul. Are you ready to give your life and your soul? If this is the only way to return Shivangi's happiness, then yes. I am ready to give my soul to that witch.
