SCAMPERMOUSE IN A JAM It's summer in Huckerbuckerley Forest. The birds are chirping. Here comes Granny Mouse with her umbrella. She carrys it because she doesn't want the owl to spot her. When a little field mouse takes a walk she must stay alert were dangers stalk. There are lots of creatures who would love to have a tasty mouse to eat. It could well be you, it could well be me. It could well be tra-la-lee. When the owl is sitting way up high. She will study all those passing by. She'll wonder who the creature underneath the umbrella might be. It could well be you, it could well be me. It could well be tra-la-lee. In the forest there's a fox's lair. You will never find a field mouse there. 'Cause the fox who lives there will try to eat up a mouse who's walking by. He could eat up you, he could eat up me. He could eat up tra-la-lee. Huh? What was that? Help! Where did the little field mouse go? I'm flying along through the woods. I fooled Harry Hedgehog good. And there I see Malcolm expecting me. Hello, hello, it's me, do you see? Hello, hello, it's me, do you see? Hello, Granny. What a nice surprise. Hello, Malcolm. I was very close to being eaten today. - Crumbs. That awful fox. - Yes. But it wasn't the fox this time. Today it was Harry Hedgehog. Crumbs, anyway. To both the fox and the hedgehog, and the owl. It's sad that it has to be this way. That we keep eating one another. Yes. That's the way it's always been. We eat one another, and that is that. Let's talk about something pleasant. - How about a cup of coffee? - Thank you. Delicious coffee. And what a nice sponge cake, too. - It's from Bunny's Bakery. - Very good. - And what have you been up to? - I've been gathering nuts. - Now I have a whole bagful! - You are a very clever mouse. There's just one problem. One doesn't sleep too well at night when one is so awfully clever. Because then one lies in bed thinking like this: "What if someone comes to steal my supplies?‚Äù I think you should take your nuts to the bank. Then you get a bank account, and you needn't worry about such matters. - Thanks for coffee. - You're always so wise. Yes, I am. Now pick up your bag and let's go. Now come along. Right-o! You're looking at a mouse who has nuts in the bank. How right you are. Who's that over there? The others gather walnuts and store them in the house. But I would rather live life, a lazy happy mouse. And when my stomach's empty, I'm singing anyway. Tra-la-loo-la-lay... I wrote a song on Tuesday on behalf of Mr. Jones to his wife, - - whom he adores. "A catchy tune," said Jones, that's what I think, anyway. "A hundred-fifty walnuts, that was my princely pay." Tra-la-loo-la-lay... - Hello there. - Hello. - Who is your companion? - That's my helper, Marius. And can you guess what I've got in my bag? A lot of nuts. Where did you get them? I got them for writing a song for Mr. Jones. - You mean, you get paid to do that? - Yes. If you are famous, like myself. One hundred-fifty nuts, Malcolm! Now we're going to Bunny's Bakery to spend all of it on sweets. And then we'll eat and drink until we drop! You're all welcome. - That would be really terrible. - Terrible? That's right! Be sensible and put the nuts in the bank in stead. - Open an account! - Look here, Scampermouse. - I have a bank book of my own. - Now, come along, young man. This is probably very silly of me! Stamping here and stamping there. Careful and exact accounting. Write down what they have to spare. Writing, stamping, interest mounting. God morning, teller. This is my friend Scampermouse. - He would like to deposit some nuts. - That's no problem. - Where are the nuts in question? - They are here in this bag. Look at that! It seems to be a substantial sum. - Two-four-six-eight-ten-fifteen... - Mr. Teller? - Thirty-forty-fifty... - Mr. Teller? - Fifty, sixty-seventy-seventy-two... - This is really getting out of hand! - Eighty-ninety-ninety-eight... - I would like the rest for myself! - Please be sensible! - I've been sensible enough. - One hundred nuts! - Good bye. Hold it! My young fellow! Your bankbook! There you are. Deposit to account: One hundred nuts! Bye-bye! Do come back soon! One hundred nuts in the bank. Fortunately, I still have fifty left. And now, Marius, you and I go straight to Bunny's Bakery! Master baker Bunny Bun is an able baker. Bun will often have a run on the cakes he bakes for fun, - - that able pastry-maker. Autumn came. Then winter and spring and summer again. These were peaceful times. One day everybody was preparing a big party. Because soon Daddy Bear turned fifty. And everywhere joy and music was in the air. We're going to a birthday-do, it only stands to reason. When Daddy Bear turns fifty years, around about this season. We all cheer for Daddy Bear, who turns fifty years this year. The owl did fly from tree to tree announcing earth to heaven... "Tomorrow there's, at Daddy Bear's, a birthday-bash at seven!" Daddy, Daddy, Daddy-O, we will all to Daddy's go. I'll play songs the whole night long, the food will be so yummy. Daddy, Daddy, my oh my! Always a terrific guy... What was that? O, what horror! My guitar is all broken! Look! Now I can't play the guitar anymore! I can't play at Daddy Bear's party! It's all over! Let the owl come! I have nothing left to live for! Let the fox come eat me! No! I didn't mean what I said! I didn't mean it! No! Help! The fox is after me! Fox! I can see you! I'll tell Daddy Bear about you! There's nothing to tell. I just tried to cheer him up a little. - What ever is the matter? - O, awful! It's so sad and tragic! My guitar is no more! No party at Daddy Bear's... - But why don't you buy a new guitar? - Oh no, that is no good. I'm just a poor musician without a guitar. Let the owl down and take me! - Let the fox come! Oh, crumbs. No. - But what about your bank account? I can't play music with this, can I? But you can withdraw some nuts from your account, and buy a new guitar. Nuts from my account. Hurray! Why didn't I think of that? Then there'll be song and dance and party after all! And a new guitar! Hurray! Ninety-nine, one hundred. One-two- three... One hundred and four nuts! - There you are! - But I only had a hundred. Interest. Interest, my friend. You had a hundred. Now you have one hundred and four. Have a nice day! Well, thank you very much, Mr. Teller. Scampermouse bought a brand new guitar, and again all was bliss. The birds were singing in the trees, an orchestra so hearty. Daddy welcomed all the guests arriving to his party. - Daddy, come what may. - It is daddy's day today. Daddy, Daddy, come what may. It's daddy's day today. The mice gave Bear the sweetest gift, a lollypop sensation. It's something sweet to lick during your winter hibernation. Daddy Bear deserves a treat. It will taste so nice and sweet. The big moose shook his antlers gently, asking for attention. And gave a speech as beautiful as any you could mention. Our own sweet old Daddy Bear, you are fifty years this year. Hey, hurray for Daddy Bear! The animals applauded. The fox would use his tail to wipe the tears he had been crying. Daddy, Daddy, my oh my! Always was a stand-up guy. But then the little Bunny said... "He dreams of grass and clover." The animals all realized the party was now over. Daddy, Daddy, Daddy-grey, hope you had a lovely day. Hip-hooray for Daddy Bear, our kind and gentle dear!
