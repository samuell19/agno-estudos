("Le Nozze di Figaro Overture" by Wolfgang Mozart) (applause) WILLIAMS: Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention please. There will be a minor change in the program tonight. Tonight the part of Robin Williams will be played - by the Temptations. - (laughter) ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen. From the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City, Mr. Robin Williams. (cheering) Oh, ho ho! Thank you. Howdy! Oh, wrong opera house, thank you. (laughter) I would like to thank Imelda Marcos for her earrings. (laughter) Thank you Imelda, thank you. Goddamn, now I'm wondering what the fuck am I doing here? This is incredible. How do you get to the Met? Money, lots and lots of money. Goddamn, wonder if Pavarotti's at the Improv going, "Two Jews walk into a bar." - (laughter) - Yes. Hello. Goddamn. This is an incredible place. Look at this and these sets. Placido Domingo does The Music Man, ♪ Oh ho that Wells Fargo wagon ♪ ♪ It's a coming down the street ♪ ♪ So don't let it pass my way. ♪ This lovely coach left over from the second royal wedding. And if you're royal too, you have to learn to do this all the time. It came from this but means this, anyway. Thank you! Isn't it amazing? When you look at Prince Charles, don't you think that someone in the royal family knew someone in the royal family? Now, come on. - (laughter) - His big old ears. Boy, if you saw ears like that on someone down south, he'd be going - (imitating banjo playing) - (laughter) Jeez, look at this, I keep going, what... Easy Lumpy, we'll be right with ya. (laughter) How you like the play, Mr. Lincoln? Duck! - (laughter) - Thank you. This is like a place where Robin Leach could go, "Welcome to Adnan Khashoggi's living room!" (laughter) "Yes, this man makes more money than "you could ever goddamn dream of. "I'm Robin Leach with a voice so loud even animals go, ""who the fuck are you?"" - (laughter) - Thank you. Nice to have you here, you're a little late. We have to go back and start at the beginning. We had a quick thing, I'll show you. (laughter and applause) I kinda ran out, we did this, we kinda played around, went back, did a quick thing with the coach. And we walked around, looked around here, and basically I'm scared shitless, I can't lie. (laughter) And they also have ballets here. Ballets, men wearing pants so tight you can tell what religion they are, yes! (laughter) Hmm, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Goddamn, Oscar Levant said that ballet is the fairy's football. I say, yeah! If that's true maybe you should have Tom Landry working with the ballet going, "Alright Baryshnikov, come over here, everybody huddle up. "I want you to take Giselle out, lift her, "throw her down, five yards. - "Everybody else... - (laughter) "You know the ballet's not over until the swan takes it "in the ass, you know what I'm saying, everybody come on!" (laughter) Maybe you have a choreographer working with a football team. "All right, everybody line up, everyone line up. "Oh, my God, a smorgasbord, look at this! (laughter) "All right, all right, who's the tight end? "Fabulous, you stay right there, I love you. - "Okay. - (laughter) "All right, what I want you to do, a simple pattern. "Everybody run long, do this, attempt to catch the ball. "The rest of you push, push, push, push, push. - (laughter) - "I love it, I love it." There's a little man in here going, "I'm sorry, he's not here tonight." Hmm, take a little sip here to relax. God, thank you for coming, I uh... (applause) Damn. Little sip of Perrier here, I had to stop drinking alcohol because I used to wake up nude on the hood of my car with my keys in my ass. - (laughter) - Not a good thing. "Hi, can I help you?" "No thanks, it's just flooded. I'll be okay. "Beautiful, baby, beautiful, yeah." Because you're sucked into drinking beer by believing it's a healthy thing. All these beer commercials usually show big men, manly men doing manly things. You've just killed a small animal, it's time for a lite beer. Why not have a realistic beer commercial. What's the realistic thing about beer? Where you go, it's five o'clock in the morning. You've just pissed on a dumpster, it's Miller time. (laughter and applause) It's a scary thing, because you realize the first purpose of alcohol is to make English your second goddamn language. Eventually you may be quite fluent. You may be a Nobel Prize physicist. After nine, maybe ten Heinekens you're going, (gibberish) You're speaking fluent drunkinese, bravo. Next thing you know you got a couple more beers, you've got a friend in a headlock going, "I love you little fucker, I love you. (laughter) "That's the kind of love I have for ya baby, goddamn it." And then you work your way beyond beer. You go beyond beer, you start into wine. For the very elegant people, people, a lot of people who are very elegant are in Montauk going, "Damn it, I wish I could've been there, but no, I'm not." Some people who have, you know, I don't know whether to have the red wine with the fish or the chicken. What's it matter asshole, they're dead. (laughter) The chicken's not gonna reach up from the plate and go, the red wine, ugh. (laughter) It's over with. No, you know what I'm saying? And I'm not talking about Pouilly-Fuissé or pussy fussy, uh uh. I'm talking about Mad Dog 20/20. - (laughter) - Mmm. You know, the very elegant wine, the type of wine with a lovely screw top. A bottle of which after you can actually see vapor trails as people pass you. (laughter) How you doing? - (vocalizing) - (laughter) (laughing sinisterly) You've gone too far and you must pay your dues. This is why I had to give up alcohol, 'cause you have to pay the next day. Pray, dear Lord, please don't hurt me now. There you are lying in bed and you feel like the scene from the movie The Fly going, "Help me, help me!" The entire room is spinning like a roulette wheel. Place your bets, place your bets. (laughter) And there's the old toilet in the corner going, "Talk to me. (laughter) "Talk to me." Oh ho ho! And you realize, oh God, next stop for me, Betty Ford Hospital. There you are, you become a reformed alcoholic. You've got a steaming glass of Perrier, going, "I feel so much better about myself." - (laughter) - Goddamn it. "I feel really healthy now. "No, go ahead, have your cocktail. "I'll be over in the corner hurting the cat." (cackles) - Oh, goddamn it! - (cheering) What is it about that? But of course, there are people in the bathroom right now or a little late for the show, these seats going, (sniffing) "Has the show started? (breathing quickly) "Well, you think this has any speed in it? "I don't know, yes, probably Lumpy. "There ya go." Yes, we're talking about cocaine. Mmm, what a wonderful drug. Anything that makes you paranoid and impotent, give me more of that. Mmm, what a great thing to do. Whoop, we're back with sound again. (laughter) Sorry about the sound. I got the sound from Hollywood. (laughter) Alright, people from the balcony were going, we understood him, I guess Juilliard helped for a brief moment. I could enunciate to the back row, just like Sylvester Stallone doing Hamlet. This would be a place where Stallone could do Hamlet. - "To be, or what? - (laughter) "Yeah, yeah damn." Jeez, we're back again. We were discussing cocaine for a brief moment. The sound crapped out, but that's why I'm using Suppos-i-sound. No one wants their tapes back, I wonder why. We were talking about how cocaine basically affects you. There's also something called freebasing. It's not free, it costs you your house. It should be called home-basing. (laughter) Here's a little warning sign if you have a cocaine problem. First of all, if you come home to your house, you have no furniture and your cat's going, - "I'm outta here prick," warning. - (laughter) Number two, if you have this dream where you're doing cocaine in your sleep, and you can't fall asleep, and you're doing cocaine in your sleep, and you can't fall asleep, and you wake up and you're doing cocaine, bingo. (laughter) Number three, if on your tax form it says $50,000 for snacks, mayday. (laughter) You've got yourself a cocaine problem, smartass. He-he-he-he. And everybody's doing cocaine. Baseball players have to go in front of a grand jury. They're saying, "Yeah, I did cocaine. "But can you blame me? it's a slow goddamn game. Come on, Jack. (laughter) "I'm standing out in left field for seven innings, "there's a white line going all the way down to home plate. (laughter) "Hell, I see the guy putting it out going, - "" ha ha ha ha ha.' - (laughter) "And that damn organ music, that (singing notes to Charge) "The third base coach doing this shit all the time. (laughter) "When he does this I don't know whether to slide "or do a line, you know what I'm saying? "And people sliding into home plate head first." "Yeah, you out!" "Doesn't matter baby, I'm up now." - (laughter) - Ha ha ha. Yeah, yow! And don't tell me, don't tell me those old time baseball players weren't doing cocaine. You ever see those old films of Babe Ruth, with him going... (laughter and applause) Tell me that, he was speeding his titties off. - (laughter) - Goddamn. Now, there must be some sport where they don't do drugs. I mean, there're not golfers on cocaine sitting at the first tee and going, "Fore, five, get it outta here. (laughter) "I can't take it! Little golf cart, ehh, "Too slow, I'm running, I'm running!" And you couldn't be paranoid in a sand trap going, "I'm never getting out of here alive, man! (laughter) "I'm never getting out of here alive!" The commentator, "He seems to be having problems on the third tee." "Why you talking so low man? "Why are are these 300 people walking behind me so slow? "Look in the hole, there might be a snake. "Look in the hole!" (laughter) Golf is one of the few sports where a white man can dress like a black pimp and not look bad, you know what I'm saying? (laughter and applause) It's a nice thing. I want to tell you one thing. You don't really need cocaine to get really high, you know what I'm saying? 'Cause there's another way to get really high and it's real cheap. Just run 26 miles. You ever see a marathon runner? You ever see the look on his face? It's the same look like, ha ha ha. (laughter) "How you doing?" "I'm alive!" (laughter) Yeah, and it only costs you a pair of fucking shoes, you know what I'm saying? It's the same thing. You know why he's so high? Because his body is pumped full of endorphins. It's the brain going, "If you keep this pain shit up, I'm gonna hurt you." (laughter) 'Cause that's why when you run, the first couple of miles you're going, "I'm fabulous." After about eight miles you're going, "I'm not too good." (laughter) After about 26 miles you're going, "Why the fuck did I do this?" (laughter) And you have that look like (laughing manically). And you never see a guy hanging out by a track going, "Psst, my man, you need a pair of Nikes? (laughter) "Try one shoe on, do this for a while. "Because you don't need it." The basic thing to remember about cocaine is this. There was once a documentary, they asked a Peruvian Indian chief, They said, "Chief what's cocaine?" He looked right in the camera and said, "Cocaine is our little gift to the white man "for what you did to us. (laughter) "Yeah, you take our land, we give you monkey for your back." (laughter) That seems fair. (cackles) Don't you know that, don't you see it now, squabbin? Of course, I know a lot of people going, "You know, Helen and I basically, "we did drugs in the '70s, but in the '80s, what we liked to do "is get all of our stuff together "and go, 'mm, that gets me high, that's it.' "We like to look in the Sharper Image catalog and go, "" we don't have that yet, we don't have that yet.' (laughter) "And that whole thing in Africa pisses me off. "Everyone's sending food to Africa. "Let's send some cocktails, let's make it a party, goddamn." There's your father over there with 15 cups of coffee, eight cigarettes going, "Your mother and I never did drugs." Beep, "Come on, Pop." (laughter) Your mom's taken three Valiums, she's passed out in front of the T.V. going, "Don't change the channel." (laughter) (groans) Don't you see, don't you see. Oh, look at this, maybe if Japanese people did cocaine it'd be like (imitating speaking Japaneses). (laughter and applause) You have to be very careful, because they can nail your ass at any time. In California you can get nailed for not having your seat belt on. If you're on the freeway, there you are, you see a cop. "I don't have my seat belt on!" (imitating crashing sound) Next thing you know, you're on the hood of your car going, "You realize you didn't have your seat belt on?" - "No shit, yeah." - (laughter) California, we got different type of police. You get stopped in West Hollywood, "Stop! "Those shoes don't go with those pants." (laughter) But you're used to police here, a little bit easier. Basically, your New York cops, couple hundred pounds overweight, wandering around like, "Hey." You know what I'm saying? He's over there going, "Fuck Miami Vice. "Where's my Maserati? Nowhere, okay." (laughter) Somebody comes up with a knife, "I'll kill you!" "Okay, give it your best shot, ehh, okay, get outta here, "gimme the knife, go on. - (laughter) - "There ya go, go on." It's a whole other bag. But of course, the best police in all the world, you know what I'm talking about, below that little Manson Nixon Line, yeah. Just down below there, when you're going down south, you get stopped in your BMW there, smartass, you're in for a good time. (laughter) They're the good ol' boys, the ones wearing the mirrored sunglasses, with the mirror on the inside. (laughter) Yeah, you're ready now. (laughs) They usually have on assistant that sits in the car going, (laughing maniacally) "We got him, Bubba, don't we?" "We got him now, he-he-he, squeal! "Get ready for it, squeal, come on," - (laughs) - (laughter) Man, you're scared boy, you're scared. You think you're gonna end up in a cell with a man named Bubba going, "You're my little puppy now." (laughter) Isn't it strange to think that if you commit sodomy in Georgia, they're gonna put you in a cell with another man who's gonna sodomize you, whoa. - (laughter) - This is southern logic. (applause) The whole country's intense. You wanna know why the police are intense? Because we're intense. We're armed, and they're armed, yay. It's in the Constitution. It says you have the right to bear arms, and the right to arm bears. Whatever the hell you want to do. (laughter) The National Rifle Association says you have the right to have armor-piercing bullets if you're a hunter. Why? How many deer wear a bulletproof vest? (laughter) Is there one big deer out there going, - "I'm ready for your ass. - (laughter) "Come on, give it your best shot, let's party. "I've got a human call." I've got a Coors, I've got a Coors. Isn't is scary to think that most hunters are people who drink a lot of alcohol with a heavy-caliber weapon out there going, - "Yeah, looks like a deer. - (laughter) (imitating gun shots) "Oh, shit, sorry Bob." "Eh, strap him on the truck anyway. (laughter) "Cut a couple of limbs off, "put 'em on there, they won't know." God, we're all armed. Here in New York, at least you don't get a lot of handguns. In California, everybody's got handguns, even ladies who're just carrying 22's; just makes a small hole. - (sound effects) - (laughter) "I got tired of carrying my mace "because I used to mix it up with my breath freshener and go, (imitating spray noise) "oh, there goes the day." (laughter) It's to the point in California where you're gonna come home and go, "Honey I'm home." "Easy dear." "Hold it honey." "Dad, I gotcha." "Hold it boy." - One up there. - (laughter) It's Family Feud, the home game. It's the Mansons versus the Hinckleys, come on down. (laughter) Show me automatic weapons, survey says, 50% dead. Now in England, if you commit a crime, the police don't have a gun and you don't have a gun. So if you commit a crime it's, "Stop, or I'll say stop again." (laughter) But here, everybody knows we are armed and it's escalating. It's gonna get to the point where you're gonna come home one day and people across the street are going, "I built this cruise missile to stop these kids "from playing ZZ Top." (laughter) And the next thing you know, it goes beyond that, it's Road Warrior on the freeways. People start mounting twin 50-caliber machine guns on the front of their Chevrolet, going, "Look Helen, a slow Chinese driver." (laughter and applause) No, you think you've got him but he's in front of you going, "Nah, I've got a flame thrower in the trunk, you won-ton." (laughter) And one little old lady up in the front of them with her little tiny Volkswagen with a grenade launcher, going, "Make my day." (laughter) It's all there. We're Americans, we're a simple people. But if you piss us off we'll bomb your cities. - Think about that. - (laughter) Just ask the Japanese, they'll go, "What, we bomb one harbor, "next thing you know, you nuke our town. "But the nice thing is you build us back up, "you buy our products, nice people." (laughter) The whole thing, and at the top of the heap. There's Ronald Reagan with a look in his eyes like they're gonna put swinging doors in the Congress. So it's gonna be, eh, "I'm back and I'm pissed off." (laughter) He's got that look in his eyes. Here's a president that said, "What would this country be without this great land of ours." - What? - (laughter) - Excuse me? - (applause) "Wait a minute, excuse me, sir. "Mr. Reagan, under redundant in the dictionary it says, - "See redundant." - (laughter) "Fine, you got me on that one." Don't you see that look in his eyes? He's not dealing with the real world anymore. Here is a man that in a presidential debate referred to army uniforms as costumes. - Mm-mm. - (laughter) So in other words, war is the big film. So if he launches a nuclear weapon, - "That's a wrap, everybody." - (laughter) No, Ron, no! Don't you see when he's talking to Congress he's got that look in his eyes like it's not Congress anymore. It's the old actors' home. There's Tip O'Neill, he's talking about Central America but all of a sudden Tip's face starts to melt to Ron. It's not Tip anymore, it's Duke Wango, "Oh, forget these pissants. "Let's get down to Nicaragua and kick some ass." You could see Ron go, "I'm with ya, I'm with ya, Duke. "I'll get the Contra ponies, we'll be outta here." And there's Casper Weinberger looking a lot like Bela Lugosi going, "We can't do it during the day." (laughter and applause) Yes. Then there's Shultz and Bush, kinda like Stan and Ollie. "Now you've done it, we've over-balanced the budget." - Hmm, there you go. - (laughter) Don't you see? And Henry Kissinger, the phantom of Congress, somewhere in the background going, "They don't understand you like I do. "You have to understand me. Look here, Mr. Reagan, look, "Cambodia, Nicaragua, Cambodia, Nicaragua, shh. "I'll be here if you need me, I'll be in the back." - Wow, Ron's got that knock. - (laughter and applause) Suddenly, suddenly Teddy Kennedy stands up, but it's not Teddy Kennedy anymore to Ron. It's Jimmy Stewart going, "Mr. President, "you can't do this without the will of the people." Ron gets scared. "No, no, there's no place like the White House. "There's no place like the White House." (laughter) Thinks about Star Wars, goes back to his room, puts on a black robe and suddenly, he's Obi Ron Kenobi. Standing there, Nancy has two danishes strapped to her head going, - "Help me Obi Ron. - (laughter) - "Help me Obi Ron." - (applause) Don't you see when you look at Reagan, he was Disney's last wish, don't you see that? (laughter) Just before Disney died he went, "Make a president." (exhales) And all the cartoon characters went, "Yeah, you heard what he said, come on everybody. "Goofy, you be Secretary of the Interior." - "Uh-huh." - "Come on!" (laughter and applause) He's got that look! There it is. - The way he moves. - (cheering and applause) It's strange, though. Don't you see the way he moves? It's like the Lincoln exhibit at Disneyland, don't you see? When he gets up it's like (imitating mechanical buzzing). I just want you to know that... (imitating mechanical buzzing). (laughter) I'll be right with the question for (imitating mechanical buzzing). You expect to see Jim Henson behind a curtain going, "You moved him too far! Move his arms!" "I want you to know, the budget's balanced now." (laughter) Don't you see, one day he's gonna break down in the middle of a press conference. It'll be, "Well, I..." (imitating robot shutting down). (laughter and applause) He has to go now. Basically, it's summit time again. A summit, a summit is a strange thing where they talk about nuclear arms. It's a strange thing, it's like two lepers hand-wrestling, you know what I'm saying? Every time you push something wrong, boom, it falls apart. They're talking about partial nuclear disarmament. This is also like talking about partial circumcision. - A strange thing. - (laughter) You either go all the way or fucking forget it, - you know what I'm saying? - (laughter) And they go to Geneva, where you sit down, you buy some chocolate, have a few watches and say, hey fuck it, we can't do anything, I'm outta here, okay? No, I'm saying you're gonna have a summit, you better do it in Carmine's Clam Bar down in the village, you know what I'm saying? Get a couple of people named Vinny to go, "Sit the fuck down." - (laughter) - You get over there, you sit down with a couple of guys with a middle name "the," you know like Johnny the Fish, Jimmy the Squirrel. And you come over here, you know? "Hey Mr. Reagan, let me get you some clams, okay? "Ron, Gorbachev, what's this, a map of Albania? "Wipe that shit off, okay, come over here. - (laughter) - "Over here. "The two of you, sit down. What are you doing over here? "Come here, what is this, what, is your hair from Big Boy? "Come over here, sit down. "Let me get you, Gorbachev you want some red wine? "Let me guess, yeah, you dig, come over here. "The two of you, you work this shit out or you wake up "in the trunk of a car, you know what I'm saying? "You gotta divide it up. "Gorbachev, you start off, Reagan, "you listen and stop doing this shit. (laughter) "Okay Gorbachev, you start off." "Okay, all I want is maybe a little bit of Western Europe, "nude 3D picture of Brooke Shields. (laughter) "Because the eyebrows remind me of Brezhnev, okay?" "Reagan?" "Well, I..." (imitating mechanical buzzing) (laughter) "What the fuck are you, a Muppet?" (laughter) "No, I think I should show you who I really am." (blows raspberry) (mimics Nixon) "It's me, I'm back again! - (cheering and applause) - "I told you I'd be back. "It's Halloween Part 5! "Jason's back and he's pissed off. "I've got the tapes now and no one's fucking with me again." Richard Nixon on the cover of Newsweek is like John Hinckley on the cover of Guns and Ammo; - not a good idea. - (laughter) He's back, whoa. And it won't even be them that blows the tits off the world, no. In the Middle East, there's old Muammar Gaddafi, or as his friends call him, Mo. "Hey, Mo!" (gibberish) (laughter) (gibberish) You numbskull, no. When you look at Gaddafi, doesn't he look like a cross between Omar Sharif and Charles Manson? Kind of has those faces? He's got the handsome face, but the eyes are going "Helter Skelter." (laughter) "Helter Skelter." They call him Colonel Gaddafi. Sounds like he should have a chain of terrorist chicken stores. (laughter) Come on down to Colonel Gaddafi's Bomb In A Bucket. - Come on down. - (laughter) Bring the kids, get a grenade, come on down. Here is a man who had the audacity to go, "It's a line of death, you cross it, you die. "Okay, you cross this line, you die. (laughter) "Okay, you cross this line, you die. "This line, you die. "Okay, you knock on my door I'm not coming out, nah." (laughter) What, what is this? The only people flying to the Middle East right now are terrorists. "Will you be sitting in armed or unarmed? (laughter) "In case of a cabin seizure a small gun will fall from the ceiling. Run to the front and claim it in the name of Allah. - (laughter) - No. The whole Middle East is like an old Marx Brothers' routine, it's like, "Gaddafi," "God bless you." "Assad," "nobody,""Hussein," "nobody," "you're outta here." (cheering and applause) "Prime Minister Botha, white courtesy phone. "Prime Minister Botha, white courtesy phone." Strange thing. South Africa's getting to the point where even Lester Maddox is gonna have to go over there and go, "Excuse me Mr. Botha, can I talk to you for a moment? "George, what do you think? "Okay, come on. "Mr. Botha, Mr. Botha can I explain something to your ass? "Let me show you the odds here, Sparky. "There's 14 million black people. "There's 3 million white people. "Now, does the name Custer mean anything to you? - (cheering and applause) - "I think you gotta "circle them up, you know what I'm saying? "Either you'd better circle all the wagons, "or learn some some sports real quick." (laughter) Scary times, and there's Kurt Waldheim. "Mr. Waldheim, are you a Nazi?" "Well, we had a few beers, next thing you know "there we are in Czechoslovakia." (laughter) "What's next, Poland?" - "Nah." - (laughing) "What about that picture of you and Hitler?" "It's like The Enquirer, they matted it in, it wasn't me, no." (laughter) It's all too crazy. And oh, there's the United Nations like a traffic cop on Valium. All of this is going down, they're going, (imitates blowing whistle) "Stop. "Stop." Best thing for the U.N. to do right now is to go condo, you know what I'm saying? - (laughter) - Scary times. It makes you think that Jesus Christ is gonna come back, but this time he's not gonna look like Ted Nugent, uh-uh. (laughter) He's going to look like Charles Bronson and he's gonna be goddamn pissed off. "I'm not a carpenter this time, "I'm a sheet-metal worker and don't fuck with me, okay? "The first man I wanna talk to is Jerry Falwell. "Get his ass down here. (cheering) "Bring him over here, bring him over here." And there'll be Jerry Falwell, Jerry Falwell going, "You know, the Lord Jesus loves you if you send your money... "He's here? "Goodnight ladies and gentlemen. (laughter) "Bobby, Bobby get the plane, get the, "Jesus, how have you been? "No, I misunderstood the Bible, that's all. "I thought you said the geeks shall inherit the Earth, "please, please don't hurt me." (sobs) And all of these healers. If that man in The PTL Club is such an amazing healer, why can't he make his wife's Jiffy Pop hairdo go down? (laughter) Jim Baker and Tammy! If this man has a direct line to God, why does his wife look like Divine, - you know what I'm saying? - (laughter) Then there's Ernest Angley saying, "I will heal you." But he's wearing a toupee that's so shitty it looks like a small animal crawled on his head and went (gasps). (laughter) There's Reverend Gene Scott going, "I will compare and contrast Jesus and Spider-Man." No baby, no. Makes you think that God's up there looking down going, "I gave you a nice planet and you fucked it up." Everything's going a little strange. Our rivers are so polluted that maybe one day a five thousand pound trout's gonna crawl out of the Hudson and go, "I wanna talk to anybody from Dow Chemical, anybody. (laughter) "Get his ass over here. "I got some two-headed babies to show your ass. "Better living through chemistry? "Show me this." (vocalizing) "But we believe now the accident at "Chernobyl has been taken care of. "If you'd like to follow us into the plant, - "I'll show you around." - (laughter) Tom Waits once said that you know, maybe there's no devil; he's just God when he's drunk. Well if God drinks, you think that God gets stoned once in a while? Look at a platypus, I think so. (laughter) (inhales) You think God's up there going, "Okay, let's take a beaver. (laughter) "Okay, let's put on a duck's bill. "Hey, I'm God, what are you gonna do? "Okay. "Okay, he's a mammal, but he lays eggs. "Hey, Darwin! (vocalizing) - (laughter) - "There you go!" Because nature does that, nature has no rules. It has no rules at all. Every time you think there's a rule for nature it goes, "No, no." (kissing noise) "I'm outta here." (laughter) If we take the planet out, if we blow this earth to death, we're gone, (ripping noise) nothing. Nature will go, (grunts) "I'm back." (laughter) It'll keep going, it'll be new forms, different things. That's what spring is. Every spring, every animal has that look in their eyes like, "Yeah." Flowers like Barry White going, "Oh, baby, give me your hairy stamen now." (laughter) That's why your dog looks at you like, "Listen, man, you got a choice, okay? "I can either hump your leg or "leave the house, it's up to you. - (laughter) - "Your choice." It's a time when your cat looks at you like, "Have you ever seen this before?" (laughter) Basically it's that urge, it's springtime. It's nature crying out, "Let's party!" It's time to go wild and do the dance of love. It's time when male birds do that incredible thing where they go, "Check it out, check it out. "Check it out, I'm incredible, check it out." And the female birds are usually going, "Maybe? Maybe?" Yes, and we as human beings, we are driven by the same sexual desire. Men, you know you have a tiny creature living between your legs that has no memory and no conscience, you know that. - (laughter) - You know you have no control! There is no control over this tiny beast. You wake up in the morning, he's been up five minutes before you're like, "How you doing?" (laughter) No conscious control! He's there, ya-hah. "Morning! Time for jumping jacks." And whoever you live with, they look at you like, who are you thinking about? (scoffs) He looks at them with that one good eye, "Nobody, I'm on my own. "Let's play horseshoes, get a towel, "put a hat on me, let's take a chance." (laughter) And you may be playing sports, you may be with other men, you've just done manly things, you've played a good game of football, you've just turned your friend's face into goo. You're in the locker room, you're soaping up going, "Good game, everybody." All of a sudden he rises up and goes - "Hey, good game, everybody." - (laughter) And all your friends are going, "Yeah, real good game, Bob." (laughter) You have no control! It should be a separate creature. You should be able to take it off, boom, put him on the ground. Take him for a walk, he's got the rollers, - he'd be like (vocalizing). - (laughter) Make it a different beast! (cheering and applause) That way... You'd have some control, at least some control. "Heel!" (snarling) "Sit!" (groaning) You'd have some control of him, but as it is now, you have none. No control at all, women know this. When you look at it, you can see the look in their eyes like, "Well, it's a ridiculous piece of flesh. (laughter) "My God, looks like a snail wearing a helmet, what is it?" Or if you're uncircumcised, looks like a snake wearing a sweater, you know that. It's ridiculous, but the moment he starts to rise, yeah. It's a different case, they get that look in their eyes like, "Alien!" - (vocalizing) - (laughter) Strange, why, why is he here, why are we driven by this desire? We have lust! Lust permeates our soul sometimes. Men, we are so driven by this lust that we have a violent streak that comes along with it. If we can't fuck it, we'll kill it, you know what I'm saying? It's like that. That's why we make weapons, a nuclear bomb, it's basically a man's way of saying, "I'm gonna fuck up the earth, yeah." A woman would never make a nuclear weapon, they would never make a bomb that kills you. They'd make a bomb that makes you feel bad for a while. (laughter) See, that'd be a whole other thing. That's why there should be a woman president. Don't you see? That's be a wonderful thing! (cheering and applause) It'd be an incredible concept, that. There would never be any wars, just every 28 days some intense negotiations. (laughter) That'd be a good thing there! (applause) Because you have that release, as a woman every 28 days you can get crazy! Your friend comes into town, I don't think it's a friend, do you? How many friends make you wanna stand on top of the roof with an automatic weapon and go, "Get in the house! - (laughter) - "Get in the fucking house!" No, it's not a friend. That's why men are going, "Well, maybe not." - (laughter) - (cackles) We're driven, we are driven by this desire, by this strange creature. Wouldn't it be nice sometimes, wouldn't it be nice if you could go into a bar, buy him a drink once in a while. There'd be a big bar up here, a little bar down here for him. (laughter) Go into the bar, yeah, put him out. He's looking up at you with that one good eye like, "How ya been, baby? (laughter) "Sorry about last night, I guess I got nervous, "fired off a couple of warning shots, what the hell. (laughter) "But if you didn't try and strangle me, "I'd have a better chance, you know what I'm saying? "The hell, I can't go back in there, man, "that's some scary stuff, you know what I'm saying? "I'm not going back without a wet suit and a mining helmet, - "I tell you that. - (laughter) "You better work on that stuff, "I'm not going back, hell no, I won't go... "Hey, forget what I said, who's that? "I'm going down here, you talk to her, "down scope." (imitates mechanical buzzing) Don't you see? It'd be the only true character witness you could ever have at a divorce trial. "Your Honor, I'd like to bring out "a character witness right now. (laughter) "I believe it has a lot of bearing on the case." (whumps) "Promise to tell the whole truth, nothing but the truth, "promise to raise your right hand?" "I don't have a right hand, "but I'll give it a shot. (whumps) - "Mr. Phallus. - (laughter) "On the night of the 15th, what do you remember?" "Well, it was light, it was dark, "it was light, it was dark, it was light. (laughter) "Couldn't see very well. "The hell I'm supposed to do? "Goddamn it, what the hell am I supposed to do, "what do you want from me, goddamn it? "I didn't know, he's the commander, I merely sat "down here, I held the testicles, I didn't know why. "I am not an animal, I am a sexual organ!" It is this creature, this lust. But what compensates for this? There's also your heart. Your heart is romance going, "What about love? "What about poetry?" and he's down there going, "Whatever works, babe, yeah." (laughter) Then above romance, there's your mind going, "Ah, I believe you're both right. "We must propagate the species, but we still must have "conversation afterwards, that's why I'm looking for a woman "who gives mind, if you catch my drift." (laughter) That's why we are driven to meet Miss Right, - or at least Miss Right Now. - (laughter) And you do, and you do the act, the wonderful act of making love. And you're making love, and you feel like a god, and the moment you have an orgasm you look like goddamn Goofy. (laughs) (taunting) You're going, "Yes, yes, yes, whoa! - (laughter) - "Is this fun or what! "Oh, whoa, ho ho, wow!" And if we found somebody else it'd be even more fun. Oh, God! Men can't fake an orgasm, who wants to look that dumb, you know what I'm saying? (laughter) It's an incredible thing, 'cause once a man has an orgasm he's there, as a vulnerable human being and then... (snores) (laughter, cheering and applause) At that point women usually go, "I'm ready." (laughter) And he's there like a little prize fighter going, "Uncle Charlie, I coulda been somebody, goddamn it. - "I'm melting! - (laughter) - I'm melting! - (applause) It's over, you're through. Can't even jump-start him. It's an incredible thing! You try, you try, that's when you need sexual therapy. That's when you need help from a little, tiny lady like Dr. Ruth Westheimer. - (laughter) - Yes, Dr. Westheimer. Here's a woman talking about oral sex, and you know she doesn't even eat pork, warning! (laughter) It's a wonderful way she talks about it, she talks about the penis like it's a cooking show. "First of all, take the man's penis between your fingers. - "Knead the bread," no, no. - (laughter) No, baby, don't be doing that with my tiny Johnson, nuh-uh. Ah baby, I'm saying if you want sexual help, you don't want a little tiny Jewish lady, you want a large black lady named Dr. Roof, yeah. (laughter) She'll help your ass stand, 'cause she'll be goddamned honest with you. You call and say, "Dr. Roof, I have a small penis, "does that make a difference?" She'll go, "Damn straight, baby. (laughter) "Mm-mm. "Honey, you can't make butter with "a toothpick, you know what I'm saying? - (laughter) - "Mm-mm. "Work with it baby, mm-mm. "Don't be coming at me with that little thing, mm-mm. "Dress it up, get some puppet show stuff. "Make it sing, make it dance, this gon' be, "oh, get that thing away from me! "Uh-uh, and men, men you better learn "some foreplay, you know what I'm saying? "Most men the foreplay is like 'eh, here I come, ' uh-uh. "Most men, women you know what it's like. "They grab your titties like they're making bread. "You know, like they're trying to push them "together and make one good one, uh-uh. (laughter) "These are flesh, baby, that's you. "Don't let him grab that stuff, you say you wanna "make cookies, get in there, you wanna fuck, stay here. (laughter) "Don't be doing this stuff now, nuh-uh. "And they do this thing where they grab your nipples "real hard and go, 'Ooh, does that get you hot?' "Oh yeah. "Oh, I'm on fire now, Chief Smoke, yeah. - "Mr. Vice Grip, Mr. Pliers. - (laughter) "And they do this thing where they start "grabbing your nipples and turning "like they're dialing a fucking radio. (laughter) "What the hell is that? "What are you dialing, Radio Free Europe? "Get your ass out of there. "Damn, what is this, oh yeah, I'm cooking now. "There's the woofer, there's the tweeter, "get your ass out of here. "Next time a man grabs you like this, "you grab his little testicles, 'Oh, is that a slinky?' (laughter) "I think he'll wise up. Yes sir! (whistling and applause) "He'll learn some goddamn sensitivity then. "And if you squeeze, his little eyes will go, 'wow.' - (laughter) - "You'll have his attention, "he's not gonna fall asleep on your ass then. "He starts to nod off, boom, 'I'm back, baby, I'm back.' "" Cause that's the way it is, baby, and men, "don't be afraid of oral sex, I know most men are going "" huh, I'm out of there, uh-uh.' "I say bring a lunch, stay for the day, baby. "And if you can't look at it, bring a Mr. Potato Head, "make it look like somebody you know. - (laughter) - "Yeah! "Make it look like Sigmund Freud, your Uncle Murray, anybody! "Have a good time, enjoy yourself. "Have a good time, enough of this serious stuff "like men get oh so serious like, 'Behold!' "Get that thing out of here. "Have a good time, and use some birth control, girls. "Because you better be using something, 'cause "those sperm are coming out of there at 500 miles an hour. "And a little piece of rubber's not gonna stop that, uh-uh. "It's like putting gauze in front of a semi "going, 'Come on through, ' uh-uh. "A diaphragm is at least good 'cause it's a little tiny "trampoline for the sperm, you know what I'm saying? "Doesn't stop them, but it amuses their ass for a while. "They're thinking 'Yo, hey!' (vocalizing) "Little tiny Cathy Rigby sperm doing this stuff (vocalizing). "That stuff keeps them going, "makes them wonder where they are. "And men, if they're not gonna use a diaphragm, "use a prophylactic, you know what I'm saying? "Use a prophylactic, and I know most men are going, "" I am not gonna wear a prophylactic, "" cause it makes my penis look like a tiny terrorist, uh-uh.' (laughter) "No, baby, put it on. "Even the one, the little reservoir tip "makes it look like a Krishna, I know, like (vocalizing). (laughter) "Put it on, baby, wear it. "And don't get the ones with ribs, "if you want ribs, go get barbecue, don't do that. - (laughter) - "Mm-mm. "Don't get the tickler, the French tickler one, no, "that looks like a damn sea anemone. "We're not doing Jacques Cousteau here, "get that damn thing off. "Just use some simple birth control. "" Cause ladies, the best birth control "in the whole world is simply 'ha-ha-ha!' (laughter and applause) "Just laugh at his ass. "Can't take it. They can't take that shit. "Men cannot take laughter at the mighty sword, you know that. (laughter) "That's why it's down here." But the whole damn purpose, the whole thing, the whole reason you're doing all this is because one little sperm gets through, bang, you've got yourself something wonderful. And you're lucky you get any good sperm at all, 'cause when you're making love, your testicle's like a little punching bag like (sputtering). (laughter) It's lucky your semen don't come out of there like Leon Spinks going, "I coulda fought better, Howard. (laughter) "I coulda come at him but he seemed to move away from me." That's it, one little sperm gets in there, makes contact, boom, it's like a chromosome square dance. - ♪ 24 chromosomes coming down ♪ - (laughter) ♪ 24 chromosomes spinning round ♪ ♪ Dominant gene means hair is brown ♪ ♪ Bow to your father ♪ ♪ Bow to your mother ♪ And you've just created a tiny creature that'll eventually quit college on you, too. (laughs) You're off and running, the wonders of life, and women know the moment they get pregnant 'cause there's like a ping, and they start to glow, and you expect to see three wise men show up at your door and go, "We saw a star, dude." (laughter) They've got this incredible feeling about them, and the natural process takes a slow, slow transition, and three months later the wonderful thing happens, - the titty fairy arrives. - (laughter) And in one night, she goes from zero to Aida, ya! Thank you, Jesus, thank you. (vocalizing) (humming) Even he's going, "Who the hell is that?" "Merry Christmas, thank you. "Ramming speed." (drums) No, and you make one move towards them, it's like, "No! "They're for the baby." (laughter) "Ha ha ha, come on, he's only got one mouth, "let's warm them up, come on." (laughter) No, no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no. And along with the titty fairy, something else happens a couple of months later, six months, something amazing happens. The hormone fairy arrives. And her moods start to change. Bullshit, it makes her period look like nothing. (laughter) You'll come home, she'll be waiting for you in the door with a large knife going (laughs maniacally). - (laughter) - Honey! Honey! And the only thing that'll save your ass is (trumpet fare) ♪ Häagen-Dazs! ♪ (applause) Thank you. If you leave it there at the door, she'll come out five feet and go (snarling). (hisses) It's over. And you'll prepare, you'll prepare for that moment which you think is every day, from six months to nine months every day you'll be going, "Are you okay?" And she'll be going, "I'm fine." "Are you okay?" "I'm fine." And you'll know, on that ninth day of the ninth month, it'll be time, because you'll come home and she'll have the entire house packed in two small bags. (laughter) And she'll have that look in her eyes like, "Let's go. "Now." And if you don't move, she'll grab your scrotum and pull it up over your head. (laughter) "I think you have to go now. "Let's go!" (laughter and applause) 'Cause your little wife has suddenly transformed into Ralph Kramden! "Get it out, Norton! Get it out!" Because she is passing a creature 50 times larger than the orifice it's supposed to come out. (laughter) It's whoopee time, get, go! And you're driving down the freeway, yes! She's like De Niro in Mean Streets screaming out the window, (yells). And you think, I've gotta get her to the hospital, but I've also gotta get this screaming bitch out of the car. (laughter) Dear God, help me! (yelling) Then she'll be very calm, "I'm fine. "No I'm not! Move it!" You get to the hospital, you think, okay let's go, let's go in the hospital, let's go in the hospital. You're carrying the bags, there's usually one attendant going, "You must fill out some forms." "Fuck you, Sabu, get out of the way. (laughter and applause) "No, come on, let's go!" She's on her gurney, she looks like a great white whale. (groans) "Have you seen the great white mother?" "That way!" You're rolling down the aisle, whoa! Attendants are going by going, "You better do it real quick now." Yeah, you're screaming, they get her in there to the operating room, which is a very subtle, sweet place. Bullshit, it's Earl Scheib's living room. (laughter) Bright, bright lights, she's screaming like crazy. You're going like this, "Let's breathe honey. (pants) "Let's breathe." (pants) Because you have this myth that you're sharing the birth experience. - (laughs) - (laughter) No. Bullshit, unless you're passing a bowling ball, I don't think so. (laughter and applause) No. No, baby. Unless you're circumcising yourself with a chainsaw, I don't think so. (laughter) Unless you're opening an umbrella up your ass, I don't think so. (laughter) You're not doing diddly-squat, you're along for the ride. (laughs) And you're there breathing. (pants) You're hyperventilating, she's looking at you like, "What the fuck are you doing?! "Why don't you knock me out, you asshole." And usually there's an anesthesiologist in the corner going, (inhales) "You need anything, ma'am?" (laughter) She sees him, she wheels her ass over there, "Give me that you dumb stoned prick. (inhaling, gasping) "Oh, get it out..." (laughs) And after 10, 15 hours of sheer bliss... (laughter) You're rewarded with a baby. (laughs) But bullshit, it's not a baby, it's a little old man dipped in 40 weight. (laughter) Don't you see? It's like Gandhi and Churchill had a child, - you know what I'm saying? - (laughter) A little tiny thing there, it's a little tiny creature like "I'm looking for the breast, I'm looking for the breast." It's a strange creature. And they handed me my son, they held him up and I went, (gasp) "My God, he's hung like a bear." (laughter) "That's the umbilical cord, Mr. Williams." - (laughter) - "Really? "Don't cut that. "Let him dream for a while." And they did, they cut that off. When they handed him to me, we made contact. Father, son, son, father. He looked me right in the eye, and pissed all over me. (laughter) And I realize, I'm a father now. And then comes a very special time. Your first test as a father, a diaper. You're ready, you may be a lumberjack, you may have been a Marine, you may have seen blood and guts, but you've never seen caca like this. (laughter) It's incredible stuff. It's part toxic waste, part Velcro. (laughter) First time you peel back that diaper, it's like, "Honey, I've got it, I - - "This shit is green! - (laughter) "This is incredible! "What do you feed him, algae? "My god, damn! "Oh, no. "He sucks on mama's milk, what's it do, go to Cleveland "before it gets to his asshole, what is this?" (laughter) And usually the baby's down there going, "Yo, yo!" - (vocalizing) - (laughter) While putting it on his face, got a little tiny Jolson going, "Mommy, oh I love you, oh I love you!" And you're sitting there trying to wipe it off. (cackles) You can't, you've got a little tiny moist towelette, no good that is. It's like handling radioactive waste with an oven mitt, no good! You're there doing all this, it's all over your, meanwhile your dog's over here in the corner going, "Jesus, man, why don't you just put his face in it? (laughter) "Just do that. "You wouldn't need all that stuff." It's foul, foul stuff. It's so bad that, five months later, people go, (sniffs) "You have a kid, don't you?" (laughter) "Yes. Yes, I do." And now that you have a child, you have to clean up your act 'cause you can't drink anymore. You can't come home drunk and go, "Hey, "here's a little switch, Daddy's gonna throw up on you." (laughter) You can't get stoned because they have toys that'll mess your head up. If you're stoned with a Transformer, "It's a truck, it's a robot, it's a, what the fuck is it!" (laughter) (yells) God, God! And you couldn't do cocaine, you couldn't do cocaine, there's a Teddy Ruxpin doll. "Hi, I'm Teddy Ruxpin." It's the type of doll you think that when you fall asleep the doll wakes up and goes, "You must kill mommy and daddy." (laughter) You don't need drugs when you have a kid. You're awake, you're paranoid, you smell bad, it's the same thing. (laughter) You're like, (laughs maniacally) "The baby." I've come home sometimes, found my wife in the doorway with a large knife going, "I think you should talk to him." You expect to walk in the nursery and see the kid five feet over the floor going, "Come in father." - (vocalizing) - (laughter) "Damien, put the dog down, Damien." Because they do horrible things, little babies. They go up to the dog and go, "Doggy, ah!" (laughter) you can see the dog look at him like, (chuckles darkly) "You'd be dead if you were a cat. (laughter) "But since they love you." (chuckles) - (laughter) - Scary! And then they do something wonderful though, just when you're about to play hand baby, they look at you and go, "Daddy!" (sighs) Then he looks at the dog and goes, "Daddy." (laughter) And the dog looks at you, "I don't have to send him to college. - "Yeah, ha ha." - (laughter) There's nothing you can do. My son is three years old, it's an amazing time. It's like big head, little tiny body. It's an outrageous time when they ask you about everything, it's like, "Why is the sky blue?" "Well, because of the atmosphere." "Why is there atmosphere?" "Well, because we need to breathe." "Why do we breathe?" "Why the fuck do you wanna know! (laughter) "A year ago you were sitting in your own "shit and now you're Carl Sagan? (laughter) "What is this? "Who are you! Are you Buddha? "Ask mommy, she's omnipotent, she knows everything." (laughter) It's a little tiny creature, man, and they imitate everything you do. I was driving in traffic someone cut me off, I went, "Fuck it!" From behind me in his little rocket seat a voice went, "Fuck it!" (laughter) All day long he followed me around the house going, "Fuck it! (laughter) "Fuck it! "Fuck it! "Fuck-fuck-fuck- fuck-fuck-fuck-fuck it!" Sweet little old lady walked up and said, "Oh, what a beautiful child." "Fuck you!" - (laughter) - Oh ho ho. - It's the Williams' boy. - (applause) 'Cause don't you see, children, can't live with them, can't live with them, don't you see that? They've got you! They've got that look in your eyes like, "What are you gonna do? "I'm a baby, I couldn't exist in the outside world, ehh." I see him working on emotions sometimes, I peeked around the corner, there was a mirror, he was going, (cries out) "No, no, no, no, no, no. (laughter) "Ah! No, no, no, no, no. "Ahh! Yes. - (laughter) - "That's the one." That's the one where the dog's going, "I'm out of here, pal." God, it's incredible, and I try and do sweet things for him. I try, I say, "I'll take him to Disneyland, "that'll be fun, Mickey Mouse for a three-year-old, yes. "Mickey Mouse for a three-year- old, that'll be incredible." Mickey Mouse to a three-year- old is a six foot fucking rat. (laughter) There's Mickey going, "Hi little buddy!" (screaming) (screaming) "No!" And then Goofy came up, "Uh-huh, uh-huh." "It's Dad having an orgasm!" - "No, no, come on. - (laughter and applause) "In the car." There's nothing. There's nothing you can do. And if you have children, I know a couple of you have children, you must have a few and you left them at home tonight, yeah, you snuck out you lying bastards. (laughter) you left them with a little old lady you hope doesn't have a prison record, yeah. You hope that she doesn't drink so when you call and go, "How's the baby?" "How's the baby? Fuck, I don't know. 'Cause as you walked out of the house the last thing you saw was a little face pressed up against a plate glass window going... (laughter) And you walked to the car going, "I feel like Doctor Mengele. "Help me!" But you know as soon as that door slammed, the kid turned to the sitter and went, "Pfft, old lady, they're outta here. "Let's peel off these Pampers and party! (laughter) - "You like Fisher Price music?" - (laughter and applause) 'Cause that's it, you've gotta work with them. They've got ya! They're gonna do to you exactly what you do to your parents. They're gonna come up to you and do the same thing. I know my son's gonna do it to me. 16 years from now, he's gonna walk right up to me, look me right in the eye and go, "God, dad, you're fucked." (laughter) My father will be standing right behind him going, "Yes. (laughter and applause) "Yes! (laughs heartily) "Revenge is mine!" And you have dreams about your kid, you have dreams that maybe one day your kid will be up there going, "I'd like to thank the Nobel Academy." Then you have this other dream where your kid's going, "Do you want fries with this?" (laughter) You don't know. You don't goddamn know, do you? Because it's a crapshoot, it's a damn crapshoot. And now you have to worry, you have to worry what's gonna happen with him, what the world's gonna be like. You don't even know who the next president's gonna be. If you graph the way it's going, it goes from Jimmy Carter, pretty benign, aw, bullshit, a Valium poster child, you know? Then the next one, Ronald Reagan, howdy doody senior. ♪ Everybody believe me now ♪ If you keep going benign, the next president's gonna be Mr. Rogers, he'll be like, "Hi, can you say Armageddon? - "I think it's too late." - (laughter) Or if you get macho, the next president might be Clint Eastwood, and the only man in the world who could run against him would be Jack Nicholson, yeah. (applause) It'd be truly a good debate. It'd be the shortest debate in the history of politics. All Nicholson has to say is, "How can you debate me, "you haven't opened your goddamn eyes in 20 years. "Bingo, you're gone, baby." You don't know, you don't goddamn know what it's gonna be. Maybe one day Ron wakes up, (booming, sucking sound effects) "I thought it was the alarm clock." - (laughter) - No, baby. Or maybe, maybe it's gonna be all right, maybe it will be a wonderful world, just like the Epcot center says. Maybe one day we'll travel at the speed of light, they'll have to lose our luggage beforehand. - You don't know. - (applause) You seriously don't know. There are times my son looks at me and gives me that look in the eyes like, "Well? What's it gonna be?" "Hey Zak, hey, it's, um... "I don't know. "But, maybe along the way, you take my hand, "we'll tell a few jokes and have some fun. "Hey, how do you get to the Met?" - "Money." - (laughter) "Yeah. Come on, pal. "You're not afraid, are you?" "Nah. "Fuck it." (cheering and applause) (cheering continues) Excuse me. Jesus, thank you. (cheering, whistling and applause) Thank you. Oh, thank you. This moves me, I don't know how much it moves me, but jeez this is incredible to be at the Met right now and the people at the Met are going, "You ain't coming back. (laughter) "I tell you that right now, you ain't "coming back after what you did." But we did it! (laughs) - Jeez. - (cheering and applause) Whoa. This is incredible, look out here. I wonder, do they have ballet teamsters, they're going "I'm moving the fucking set, okay, I'm moving the set." Goddamn, look back over here. They have some prop-Mr. Hoffa, five minutes, don't look. (laughter) Jesus. Ha ha ha! Yes. (laughter) Goddamn. I wonder if they have people before the opera, the guys come down, "Number 42, Pavarotti, "I'll be singing Lohengrin, thank you." (laughter) Hmm, yes. Jesus, I feel like walking away with this like, "Goddamn, I played the Met, I don't think I'm coming back, "but this has been goddamn incredible for me. "I wish the people in the balcony goddamn good luck." If you remember, isn't there like an opera rap song when they go, people who sing opera rap. "I'm a rapper kinda opera kinda thing "can't you see it then I feel it, feel it, "singing' ayee, they kinda do it in the common, "don't you die, I say baby, baby, sit and cry. "Say Aria, Aria, you're my man, "if he can't do it, Wagner can. "Say Wagner, Verdi, Puccini too, "come on everybody, do what you can do "said opera rap, opera rap. "Looking through the glasses, looking through the sight, "see the things that you do every night. "Say elephants, goats, dancing things. "Soldiers walking and the people don't sing. "They say opera rap, opera rap, "people there moving in the ballet, too, "dancing in tights 'cause they work for you. "Take it home baby and I'm out of here." God bless you New York, goodnight!
