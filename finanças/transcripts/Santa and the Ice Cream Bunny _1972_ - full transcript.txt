Ah, but a bargain's a bargain. I didn't make you buy her. I presume you're looking for a bargain in a new cow? No sir. My mother asked me to bring my cow in town to sell her.

He must have been the one who stole father's possessions. Anyway I hid in his house. And when he fell asleep I took our hen back. Did you see our others? Yes but I could only bring this. So I thought the hen would be best. I saw a harp and a bagful of golden eggs. Which he kept as the hen laid them. But this was all I could bring. Well I'm happy to have you back anyway.

Is there some complaint? I hear he returned with riches beyond his dreams. And I can do the same for you. Be back in a moment. You see? I have here a few of the ones that sent Jack into the heavens and riches beyond his wildest dreams. Perhaps I could interest you in a little trade? But we don't have a cow? There's always a price. What's your price? One hundred dollars. A hundred dollars?! Well that's pretty steep. For riches beyond your wildest dreams? Anyone would pay a hundred dollars. Wait a minute. If these beans can give you riches beyond your wildest dreams, how come you're only asking a hundred dollars for them? Ah, but the price is much more madam. I would ask many thousands, but I am a friend of the people. My good fortune, is your good fortune. But of course I must make enough to cover expenses. What a kind soul. With a nice outlook. He just wants to help his friends. The only problem is we don't have a hundred dollars. Perhaps I could interest you in our easy payment plan. Just think. Untold riches for only ten dollars down, and ten dollars and month? And we could pay for our payments, from the riches we receive, from the beans! Seems too easy to me.
