I 'am a sound man of documentaries. No matter if it is the sound of water dropping... ...of human noises in a restaurant... ...of old people banging steels... ...of fans... ...of noises in the city... ...of noises in the wilderness... The animal's nips sound, All because of me. Ziqi! Zigi! Ziqi! Zigi! It's here! What I gave you is still here. I haven't touched it. Then what is real? That's something. You can save you're sentiments. And you can also prevent them from making a scene. Hey, Xiao Long, Is your house in Beijing still vacant? I can look after your house for you, free of charge. I'll see you tomorrow morning at 10. Remember to bring your stuff. Goodbye. I'll see you tomorrow morning at 10. Remember to bring your stuff. Sirl Are you going to buy anything?

Don't worry. I am not usually a loose person. I'm different. When I'm loose, I don't act like a normal person. You've got balls. How dare you let strangers on your car? I have checked the name written on your backpack on the internet. You are a sound man of documentaries. Your work was shown on the National Geographic, right? I just want to find someone to travel with. I just like your car. Write our trip on a piece of paper. If we are heading different directions, then we should part. Al right. Great Wall at Jinshanling.

What are we having tonight? Do you know how to cook? When I was little, my mom would never let me go into as kitchen. She wouldn't even let me do any houseworks. She said that if I marry a good husband, he would hire a maid to do all the work for me. If I marry badly, I would be the maid to take care of my husband. I could learn to do housework then. Is it fun to make documentaries? It's very dangerous. What is so dangerous about it? They are just fake travelogues. Fake travelogues? Then what is real? Like Yu Shunshun? Oh! He is the man who walked through China. He is an adventurer. I think that he is just someone who likes to walk. I think that he is a great man. And he died too early. He said that I died 8 years ago. For the past 8 years, I went from being ignorant to fulfillment. I can go commercial too. I'm dead already. I'll take a rest first. Sigh! Don't say that I didn't warn you. Be careful with your food. Animals would come to take it away. And ghosts too. Help! Help! Bai Ye! Bai Ye! Bai Ye! Bai Ye! Ah! Are you crazy? Cut it out! You are really very very meaningless. Are you awake? You couldn't sleep? Take this! Nol No? Then forget about sleeping tonight. If you want to eat this, you have to read Yu's articles aloud first. The wind breezes by my body. Taking away my long awaited dreams. No fear for lows and sunsets. Embrace the longings! Embrace the flower residues! I want to keep the beauty, and sing along with you. Did you eat enough last night? I have got frighten enough Look! There is a black sheep! He must be a leader. Why? Obama! Obama! Don't run! Be careful! There is no sound. What are you recording? Hey... No cars... No men... No mall... No noises of the buildings. Is this what you're after? Yes. How about you? What are you after? I want to go places... where I don't even know. Yu said that... he cannot accept it if one day... his feet departs from the ground and arrives at a different place. It's like cheating. I cannot do it. I'm sorry. I don't have his energy. I won't risk my life or put myself in a desperate situation... for something I don't know or noises that didn't exist. Perhaps there are places for his adventures? If it were you, would you do it? I do this every day. You are too rash. Have you experienced death? Yes, sure! I have worked with a camera crew in Africa. At that place... the death of one is the existence of others. Let's go. Be care full Don't move! Or we will die together! Huh! Between virginity and life, I'd choose virginity! I'm sorry. Sigh! Be care full Bai Yel Bai Ye! Are you all right? Are you hurt? Why are you laughing? Moron! I won't tell you. If you could live 10 years longer, and die in a pool of shit... or you can live 10 years shorter and die in this place... what would you choose? I'm still gonna die, right? So, you are willing to die in a pool of shit? I don't care how I die. I only care about how I live. Yes, if one can live to the fullest... one wouldn't die a meaningless death. Close your eyes. Why? Just close your eyes! Al right. Stand up. What's all this mystery? Don't open your eyes! All right. Hold this carefully. Listen carefully to the wind! Don't open your eyes! All right. Open your eyes! What are you doing? Don't move! It's dangerous! Don't move! It's dangerous! Come back now! Now, my life is under your feet! Come back! Be care full If it were me, I would rather die here. Come back! This is too romantic! Come back! It's dangerous! Come back quickly! Don't go. All right. I can come back. But you have to promise me one thing. All right. Say it. Write a song for me. You don't have to threaten me for that. And... I want you to face the earth... and read aloud the words of Yu. To let all the Chinese people hear you. I'll read. I'll read. Don't move! I'm sorry. I was wrong. What you did was meaningful. There are no words to describe it. What you did was marvellous. I'm done. Come back now! Hurry! Now... Read aloud his speech! Where is it? It's in your hands. It's for my parents. I have to accomplish six tasks. First of all, I have to walk through... all the 31 provinces and autonomous regions in China. I would walk through the Mainland first, and then Taiwan. It's over. Hurry back quickly. Be care full It's dangerous, be careful, give me your hand. What happen? Is life so unimportant to you? You would kill yourself so easily? Hello? How can you just leave a vulnerable girl like me like that? Have you faced death? That year, we were in South Africa... Forget it. What if I was in danger? Would you be so unkind? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Five years ago... I went to South Africa with the crew. One of the crew members had a fever. We took turns to carry him on our backs for a week. He died on my back. The director told me that he was not breathing. I said no, his heart was still beating. Finally, the director said... It's your heartbeat only. From then on. I cannot stand anyone dying in front of me. Even if it was a small life. I won't die. Really. At least I won't die in front of you. Sigh. Hello? Are you peeping? I'm checking if you're dead. My head is still aching. It's best of you to come in and stare at me. What? I said, my head is still aching. It's best of you to come in and stare at me. Al right. The wind is blowing in your hair. Which brings a little beauty every day. Bai Ye. Bai Ye. Bai Ye. Hello. Hello. Who are you? I 'am a friend of Bai Ye. Can you put your daughter on the phone, please? It's good to talk to you, uncle. She is not in. Are you the guy who went out with her? Yes. You know everything? Uncle Bai. Know what? She disappeared? Go to see her now! She is sick. Sick? What's wrong? I shouldn't let her go out. I shouldn't let her go out. Uncle Bai, calm down. What happened to her? Leukemia. Final stage. Go to see her! Hurry! She is staying by the lake. Don't come here! Don't come here! Don't come here. Are you all right? Don't come here! I am very ugly. Don't come here! Bai Ye. Don't come here! Bai Ye. Where are we going? To the hospital. Don't move. Lie down. A doctor was in love with me for ten years. He is the best man in the world. I'll help you find him. Don't. He has a smell of medicine on his body. When I was growing up in the hospital, I hated that smell. If you can live ten more years in the sewer... or ten less years in paradise... what would you choose? I won't choose. I was born in the hospital. Raised in the hospital. At the end, I should die in the hospital. Death is not scary. It's scary to die with regret. Like Yu Chunshun. He has not completed his path yet. Where are you going? I want to go to the treehouse. Once upon a time, A little girl married to a far off place. She left her family to live near the Great Wall. Later, she was terminally ill. Her husband was depressed. His wife's only wish... is to build a treehouse on a tree, which is a tradition of her tribe. So that she can overlook the smoke and think about her family. And think about her family. And she slowly passed away. I was thinking... Do you know why I invited to into the car? Why? That day, in front of the bakery... I told myself... I will close my eyes for ten seconds... and then open my eyes, the first person I see... I'll invite him to travel with me. What if you opened your eyes and saw an ugly person? What would you do? I did invite an ugly person into the car! From now on... let me stay with you. We have no future. Even if you stay with a healthy person... that doesn't mean you would have a future. It's you who help me regain my sensitive soul. Let me tell you... Today, I am interested to know more about Yu Chunshun. Or the tribe of Er Wenke. I'll wait for you to tell me, all right? Bai Ye! Bai Ye! Bai Ye! Bai Ye! Can you hear me? Bai Ye! Get up! Bai Ye! Bai Ye! Get up! Bai Ye! Can you hear me? Bai Ye! Bai Ye! Can you hear... You watched too much TV. I fell asleep, and my hand fell to the side. That's all. Don't you know I'm worried about you? This isn't funny. You are out of line. Don't you know? Are we all right now? No. What is burning? Oh, my soup! My soup! Oh, my soup! What should we do? Damn! We haven't eaten anything yet. Otherwise we... All right. Wait for me here. I'll buy something. I want to have a chocolate cake. Wait for me. I'll buy it for you. Bai Yel Bai Yel I've bought some food! Bai Ye! Bai Ye! Bai Ye! Bai Ye! Thank you for going so far with me. You are my best gift from heaven. Thank you... Thank you for letting me leave happily and sweetly. Please do not find her for she is gone. Let her go. Treat this as a joke. Laugh at this joke. I'm leaving now. Forget about my existence. It was only a dream. The video is only a small part of my memory of you. I will take my boundless memories with me as I leave. It's mine. I won't share it with you. Uncle Bail Where is Bai Ye? She is gone. Just gone. All right. Next question. What if it's cooked? Then we'll have a meal! Hey! How about me? I like you a lot. I like you very much. Especially when you seem a little dumb. I still like you a lot. If I come back to visit you as a ghost... Will you be afraid? I won't. Really? Uncle Bai. She has found the legendary treehouse. At the end. .. Did she say anything? She said... She knows what love is. Don't be sad. She left with a smile on her face. Do you need me to walk with you? Goodbye. Take care. Now, my life is under your feet! I won't die. Really. At least I won't die in front of you. I can come back, but you have to promise me one thing. All right. Say it. Write a song for me. If you could live 10 years longer, and die in a pool of shit... or you can live 10 years shorter and die in this place... what would you choose? Bai Ye. What Bai Ye? Your name is Bai Ye. You've mistaken me for someone else. Bai Ye. What do you want? I... know you. A lot of people know me. Have you forgotten it? Oh. Do you remember? You remember. Are you a fan? Give me an hour. I'll tell you a story. Can you close your eyes, please? Your story is too old-fashioned. I cannot write it. What? What what? Goodbye then. Bai... Do you have a twin sister? Are you on drugs? You really look like her! Really! Let me tell you, I hate travelling. I would rather die than go to the desert. My tools are the over 40 buttons on a computer. The world Is infinite, understand? Bai Ye! My name is Yanqing! The one who has the same face as you... make me live in pain and darkness for the past six months. I am a novelist. I don't like listening to other people's stories. Have you forgotten about our Great Wall? Have you forgotten about the lamb I roasted for you? Have you forgotten about the night you were going to die? Have you forgotten? I cannot forget that you followed me. I cannot forget how crazy you were. I cannot forget all those bad stories that you created. Hey... Come back. Thank you. How is life in Hong Kong? Quite good. Nice decoration, huh? I just told you... the sum of our land is over a hundred million, right? Look how beautiful it is! Come in please. Big business, huh? Of course, it's family business. The key persons are the boss, his wife, her mother, Yanging and me. Yanqing is the daughter of the boss? Right. She is a writer. She writes all the time... What is she like? I want to go places... where I don't even know. We don't want to die But, if lets us put off unpleasant duties I rather selcet the death Congratulations! You have won a free ticket. Yanqing! Yanqing! Yanqing! You followed me from Beijing to Hong Kong. This is my place. I warn you... Do you want an autograph? Miss Yanqing! Or should I call you Bai Ye? Bai Ye is dead. Why are we here? Thank you for teaching me Chinese. Otherwise, I wouldn't know that I have become the leading actor. Otherwise, I wouldn't know that I was cheated. Do you know how I survived that last six months? I have no job, no future, no credit, all because of you. Miss Bai Ye. I tried for six months but I couldn't come up with a leading actor... to make such an unwise move. You know, a writer... want his work to be original. So many people wrote about love stories in Beijing. I don't want to follow suit. I was forced to do this. Yes... I deceived you. But I didn't let you fall in love with Bai Ye. I didn't get you out of work. It's you who have become irresponsible. You sacrificed everything for it. You deserved it. Don't blame it on me! But you can say it afterwards. Before you pretend to die, you can tell me that everything was fake. Do you know how painful I was? Very painful. The kind that words fail to describe. It's like stabbing my heart. It has no feeling at all. It's like suffocating. The pain under abuse with excitement. It's like squeezing pox. It's like uterine contraction. There are so many kinds, can you tell me about it? Hey! My father is back. Uncle Bai. You're wrong. Wrong? What are you doing? Uncle Bai. Uncle Bai. Drink! Oh. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I almost got you killed. My daughter has inherited my literary temperament. She likes to write. She lives in her fantasy world. Me? I'm her father. I'm willing to do anything for her. It's just a scene. It's that simple. When I found out that you were sad because of Bai Ye... I knew that you were in love with her. I always thought that if you were in love with Yanqing... I believe that she would be very, very fortunate. I really like you a lot. Really. Come on! Drink! Come! Come! Come... Cheers! Old man, what are you doing? He was locked in for three days. The food is still outside his dooe. What is this? Life detector. Can't you just open the door and go in? Maybe he's dead. Can you give him a little respect? He is quite miserable. Compensation, otherwise I'll sue you. Compensation, otherwise I'll sue you. Compensation, otherwise I'll sue you for copyright infringement. Al right. How much? I'll buy the copyright. I don't want to. What exactly do you want? I want that truck. I want Bai Ye. I can ask my father to give the truck to you. Bai Ye. I'm sorry. You are Bai Ye? She is a fiction. Her mission has been accomplished. She has disappeared. You can play her. Didn't you used to act? I'll let you die one more time. But you have to die in front of me. I have to see Bai Ye die with my own eyes. Then my heart will die. Can you stop the nonsense? I don't want to live my life in sorrow. I cannot imagine my future life. How about this? A film company has already bought my script. It will be made into a movie. I can get you a part in the film. And I'll share my royalties with you. Can you stop bothering me? I don't want to. I 'am a writer. My mission is accomplished when the novel is complete. If you have given birth to a child, and he grew up. What would you want to do? Can you control him? I'm disgusting, aren't I? Yes. I'm calm. I'm mean and unromantic. It's Bai Ye who is tender and romantic. Not me. Thank you, boss. Your reception is great. Thank you. Have a nice day. You too. Goodbye. Goodbye. Have you eaten yet? Who is it? Who would it be? I think you should go with him. If he died here, we would have no film. You are troublesome. Me? If you're in a bad mood, speak in Cantonese. Let me tell you... An animal that stays alive after bleeding for a week. .. You should be careful about it. You have to be very careful. Are you talking about your daughter? Not just my daughter. How about this? Let me take you out for a walk, all right? All right. You don't agree. All right. Don't agree. Help me... will do you good. Old man. He's here again. One more time. The copyright of the novel will be yours. I told you that I won't repeat myself. Write a sequel to it. Just put down what happened. Is this repetition? Promise me. Otherwise, I will sue you. We will go through it one more time. I want you to die in front of me. Remember. I want you to die in front of me. You're crazy. Hello. We will play it one more time. On one condition, I don't promise I can do it. And I cannot promise that you can be cured. Don't ask me to do this again if you are not cured. All right. You promised. Naive. Remember, this is drama therapy, not... Not revenge. Yes. Yes. Yes. She would die of a terminal disease. Even if she died unconvincingly. You cannot make her die for real. Don't worry! I'll let her die naturally. OK Our daughter does make people want to kill her, right? Oh, cool! Did you buy or rent this place? I bought this place. Great! This is my dream car. You can take a look if you like. I will. Just take me for a ride. Please drop me off right in front. It's a great lapse in Beijing. It's a great lapse in Beijing. What is your name? My name is Bai Ye. Hello. My name is Ziqi. Where is your destination? To leave is my destination. Right. I'll take you to the castle. All right. Don't worry. I'm not a casual person. I'm different. When I'm casual... it's unlike anybody. Can you play it a little better? Bai Ye. Yanqing. Bai Ye! Yanqing! Bai Ye. Yanqing. Bai Ye! No wonder your father said... one has to be careful about an animal that didn't die after bleeding for a week. What about the animal who still breed at 907 Should we execute them all? Stop the nonsense, will you? Be faithful to the original. I am the original. There is no sound. What are you recording? Hush... No car...no people...no mall... No noises of the buildings. Is this what you were after? Hmm. How about you? What are you after? Yu Chunshun once said... I know. Wait... Can we skip this part? It's been so long. I cannot recall it. I hope that I can write stories for the rest of my life. To write about the romance and sincerity that was no more. The reality is too bloody. If it could be done, I want to live in a novel. What should we do next? Should I jump? I don't understand you. Why are you so silly? You're real all of a sudden. I don't want to see Bai Ye being injured. One has to play it to the end. Hello. I remember you taught me about a poem. The wind blows by my side. It took away the dreams of my past. No fear for lows and sunsets. What are you doing? It hurts! Even if it hurts! Go on. The wind blows by my side. It took away the dreams of my past. No fear for lows and sunsets. She threw up badly at that time. Remember? Let's go. Throw up! It's not like this. Throw up again. Make it more real. Do you still remember what Bai Ye said? A doctor was in love with me for ten years. He is the best man in the world. But I don't want him. Because he has a smell of medicine on his body. When I was growing up in the hospital, I hated that smell. If you can live ten more years in the sewer... or ten less years in paradise... what would you choose? I was born and raised in the hospital. At the end. .. I don't want to be in the hospital. Death is not scary. It's scary to die with regret. Like Yu Chunshun. He has not completed his path yet. From now on... let me be with you. You won't. I will. I will stay with Bai Ye forever. Forget it. I don't care if you screw it up before. But tonight... This is an important scene. Please do it good. Bai Ye. Are you hungry? I'll cook something for you to eat. Al right. What did you say? Didn't you ask if I were hungry? Again. Again. Zigi. We should calm down. Zigi. You are a good boy. You are the best man I ever met. You are tender and considerate. Although you are a little silly... but if I can stay with you, I know that we will be happy and joyful. I envy the woman who can spend her life with you. If there is a machine. That captured this moment in time... or delete a moment in time, it would be so great. If... you can delete a period of time? I hope it's this period of time. Why? If it could be done, I don't want to love you like this. Why can't you let my memory gone with the wind? If it had to end... why does it have to start? If we cannot stay in this moment in time... I would rather it never happened. I don't want to forget. Just treat this as a dream! Press here. Let us forget it all. Bai Ye is leaving. Forget about me. Promise me. I don't want to see you in pain anymore. A map finds a backpack. A coastline finds a highway. A beach finds a wave. A small path finds the sandals. A mailbox finds a postcard. Give me a one-way ticket to heaven. Let me stop looking for you. Do you still remember the poem I wrote? Can you recite it for me? The wind blows by my side. It took away the dreams of my past. No fear for lows and sunsets. Embrace the longings! Embrace the flower residues! I want the beauty to stay. I have changed it. I want you to keep your life stay. Sing a sweet song to your youth. The butterflies are flying around you. To stretch the memories with infinite confusion. No regrets! No coldness! No fear of loneliness! No fear of sorrows! I want the beauty to stay. To watch over your life forever. Yanqing! Breakfast is ready. Come down to eat. Yanqing. Thank you. Thank you very much. Bai Ye is gone. She leaves in front of you. She won't come back ever again. But can you spare some time to listen to Yanqing? From the day I pretended to be a miserable patient... I only needed a person who supplies materials to me. I had no feelings for you. But you were very involved. You become attracted to Bai Ye. When I looked at you in the eyes of Bai Ye... I knew that my future would be miserable. Because I tried so hard to forget that I was Yanqing. You were in love with Bai Ye, and always will be. And always will be. And me... I would never become Bai Ye. I was not as tender as Bai Ye. I was not as soft as her. You said that you spend six months in darkness... in pain and hesitation. You think I didn't suffer? Have you been beaten by a character that you created? Don't you know that I have been waiting for you... for a whole month at the corner of your house? You heard the girl who sang as she washed the car. She was a gift from me. I asked her to sing louder. In Hong Kong... you didn't found me. I found you. Bai Ye What Bai Ye? Your name is Bai Ye. You've mistaken me for someone else. Bai Ye Of course, I know that you came to Beijing. I don't know how to share my excitement with you. You told the waiter in my father's restaurant that the noodles were especially good. Sure. I made them personally for you. Although I put in some MSG... Delicious! Another one. Your clothes are not washed by the washing machine. It was me who washed them hour by hour. When you were sleeping at night... I crept into your room. I danced weirdly in front of you. I talked to myself. I feel your breath. It was meaningless. I used to be a proud and egocentric person. That night, I was acting like a voyeur. Or a fan waiting for the kiss of her idol. You turned over again. I was so scared I fell and crawled out of the room. But you were sleepwalking. I looked at you the whole night on the floor. I was taking one step at a time. But I don't know what my next step will be. And you asked me to walk through our paths again. To do a sequel to your novel. And put down everything as it happened. This is not repetition. Do you remember how cool I was? After I said that I am not Bai Ye. I turned around and leave. Hello. We'll play it one more time. Do you remember the starry night on the fields? I fell asleep, and you were talking to my back. That was the only time I lived the life of Bai Ye completely. I have forgotten about Yanqing. It's very different the second time. I was playing Bai Ye. But I envy Bai Ye. You were speaking from your heart. I told Bai Ye to sleep for a while. And then I woke Yanqing up. Anyway, your breathing is the same. Tomorrow morning, we have to hurry. Don't be scared. I'm here with you. But this time... don't leave me alone. All right? She heard every word you said, but you fell asleep first. She looked at the starry night. Yanqing was bad. She was manipulating Bai Ye. Six months. You shut yourself in for six months. I looked at Bai Ye in the mirror every day... and touched the real Yanqing. I was suffering from romantic schizophrenia. You were suffering from depression in Hong Kong. You yelled at me furiously after reading the book. I was really hurt. You were fierce to Yanqing. But you treats Bai Ye nicely. I created Bai Ye to hurt myself. You fell in love with Bai Ye to nourish Yanqing. How is my scene where I pretended to die? You should give me a score. | die as Yanqing. This moment... Although you came back to life. But her heart is dead. Thank you for taking Bai Ye away from me. Congratulations! You have possess her forever. She doesn't belong to me anymore. Although you left the copyrights to me... Don't worry. There would never be a sequel to the book. Because I have given the copyright to God. I have left Yanqing for myself. She will retain a memory of you. So, after watching this video... you will never see me again. I still have many places to go. This car... Please drive back to my home. Uncle Bai. Uncle Bai. Uncle Bai. Uncle Bai. Uncle Bai. I'm looking for Yanqing. Go away. Uncle Bai. | love Yanqing Is Yanqing I told Uncle Bai... A year later... I will wait for her at the bakery where we first met. During that year... I went back to the places we've been. To look for the memory of Bai Ye and Yanging. But that day... In fact... today is exactly one year later. Originally, I wanted to wait for him in hiding. But I think one needs to be active in love. So, I decided to wait for him. To tell him I love him. The time is now. He didn't show up. Yanqing of the past would be in hiding until the leading actor shows up. He changed me. Is Bai Qing Bai Ye and Yanqing... Perhaps he is no longer the same anymore. He might have a new girlfriend. Fate... is the result of the chaos of time and place. Hello. Where? Waiting! Where are you? I have always been here. I am standing in the back street. Come out then. Wait! Let me tell you one thing. A year ago... I volunteered to the disaster area. I had a car accident... and was crushed by the car. My lower part of the body is paralyzed. I cannot walk up the stairs. I envy Yu Chunshun for he died in the accident. Yanqing. The romance is over. We should become reasonable. Do not comfort me. If you want to see me... just keep going, and don't look back. If you want to go back... don't hurry. Think clearly. Because this concerns a lifetime's happiness. I'll wait for you. Hello. I thought you went ahead. Yes. I will go ahead. But I need to be with you. Now, I cannot ride a merry-go-round. I'll stay with you. Close your eyes. I'll give you a gift. All right. It's closed. All right. Open your eyes. You... Don't blame me! Hey! You deceived me! Your father is the director and you are the scriptwriter. Who say so? You decieved me with him. Stand there. Stand there. This is out of line. You deceived me for so long. This is my third book. The story still revolve round these three person. Ziqi, Yanqging, Xiao ye.
