June 26, 1993. Exactly 40 years after the release of Devadasu. How many times have I asked you to not watch old movies, Sairam? Why don't you ever listen? - I want a baby like Devadaas. - That is exactly what I fear. Sairam... people wish for a child who writes like Kalidas, or sings like Yesudas, - but an alcoholic like Devadaas? - Sairam... One can achieve anything in this world using either brawn or brain. And that can be due to one's upbringing or can be cultivated individually. But... to have a heart that is as pure as Devadaas's and to be able to captivate others' hearts is something one can only be born with. I wish to give birth to a boy who is as great a lover as Devadaas. GOVERNMENT HOSPITAL VANASTHALIPURAM ANDHRA PRADESH Oh, God! Oh goodness! He is not making a sound. What happened to him? The doctor is not here at this hour. I wonder who is going to rescue this baby now. Seenu! The baby boy born in ward number nine isn't breathing and has no pulse. Come on. - Sir! - Just a minute... - Isn't the baby delivered yet? - Just stay put. What is that smell? The boy looks so strong and healthy, like a cricketer. - What are you doing? - Hey, get up! You have to get up now and hit four. Get up. Get up and hit six. He is not out. Call him. Devadaas. Come on, dear. Come on, dear. What's that Vanitha? The boy seems to be dull. You should have seen him when he was born grandma. I have been seeing him since his birth. He is as dim as the night light in the bedroom. Sairam. Hey, what did you name the boy? And what did you put here? Put what you are supposed to. What else am I supposed to put? This! He will come now. Hey, wait. Nothing will happen... It's alright, leave it! Dear. Come on, Devadaas. - Devadaas... - Come on, dear. He had health problems since birth. Let's see a good doctor. Okay, let's take him tomorrow morning. Dear, where is the boy? As per these reports, your baby has "Fetal Alcoholic Syndrome". And it is in the final stage. - What... - What does that mean, sir? If the woman consumes too much alcohol while she is pregnant, it is likely that children are born with this disorder. - Nothing like that... - Nonsense! My wife drinking alcohol! No one from our family has this habit. Well, it is impossible to hold one particular... reason as the root cause of the disease. But the symptoms of your boy... are most certainly those of Fetal Alcohol Disorder. Children with this disorder eventually lose sight, and their mental function slows down as well. Eventually, the nervous system becomes weak and the pulse rate weakens. That is the reason why they appear to be in an aberrant state. How do you treat it? There is no treatment for Fetal Alcoholic Disorder. But you are in luck. Your boy's body responds to alcohol. So, the only medication for your son is alcohol. Put two drops of alcohol in two ml of water and feed it to him thrice a day. And with the increase in age, increase the dosage. How can we feed the boy alcohol when he is a baby who is supposed to be fed milk? Listen, some people like to drink alcohol. For some, it is a habit. For someone, it's an addiction. But for your son, it is a necessity. If he misses out on even one dose, It could be fatal to him. I am going to give him a doctor's certificate as an authorized drinker. Darling, this is yours. Only you have to drink it. When the alarm goes off, you must consume it. - Is that clear? - You have already told me numerous times. I know what to do. Sit down. Listen, everyone. The District Educational Officer is coming here for an inspection. I will be able to hold on to my post only if you guys answer correctly. - What are 15 times three? - 45, sir. - What are 45 times two? - 90, sir. - Two times of 90? - A quarter, sir. Oh goodness! I beg you, please sit over there. - Good morning, sir. - Good morning. Sit down. Babu, you there, stand up. Let's not go with the A for apple, B for boy questions. Let's try something else. - A for... - Antiquity, sir. - B for... - Blenders Pride, sir. - M for... - Mansion House, sir. That's your brand, sir. - Sir! - What? Let's talk inside, sir. - The thing is my son... - Please, sir. - It's time for my son to drink alcohol... - Alcohol? Are you crazy? Tenth-grade exams are going on here. - Sir... - Leave! Get out! He wants to give his son alcohol! That's good. Additional paper, sir. Additional paper, sir. Additional paper, sir. -Complete, sir -There is still time. -Write down -My exam is over, sir. - Hit him! - Hit him! Sir! Sir! Someone, please save my son. Help! Oh, God! Oh, God! Hey! You are on our side. Why are you hitting our people? Our side, our county, our division, our district, discotheques in Delhi. I don't know any of those. When I hear the word "help", I forget all boundaries and step forward, thrashing the other side. I don't harbor any feelings of kinship or region. Do you even know why we are thrashing him? Whatever may be the reason. It's wrong to gang up on a single person like that. It's very wrong. Didn't you ask him on the day of the engagement if he had any bad habits? He said no. But he began drinking at his bachelor's party at 3:00 p.m. yesterday afternoon. He stopped drinking just a few minutes before the wedding ceremony. He is a heavy drinker. - Well then, he deserves thrashing. - That is why we were thrashing him. - Bash him guys. - But on one condition. If there is anyone among you who hasn't ever touched a drop of alcohol, only that person can hit him. What happened to the city? Why is no one talking? Hey, Roll Reddy. What's on the menu for the evening party? 50 bottles of Alcohol and 100 cases of beer, buddy. Really? So, all the guests for the wedding can drink except the bridegroom? What kind of rules are those? You go and tie the sacred matrimonial thread. Thank you, brother. There is a limit to everything. If you consume liquor within your limit, your body will function like an engine on full throttle. So, be within your limits. Tell me that limit. Ninety Ninety Ninety Ninety!

MBA Gold medalist. - Mr. Devadaas, you are appointed. - Thank you, sir. What is this smell? Sir, didn't you see the last certificate? Last certificate... Authorized drinker certificate? What is this? - Sir, I take three drinks every day. - Three drinks? Yes, sir. 90 ml each in the morning, evening, and night. Sorry, Mr. Devadaas. Sorry, Mr. Devadaas. Sorry, Mr. Devadaas. Sorry, We can't. - Look there, buddy. - Son! Babu! Be careful, buddy. Babu! Be careful, buddy. Babu! Babu! Babu! A young man named Devadaas rescued a four-year-old boy who had taken his life. The video is now viral on social media. I thought it was just a traffic jam. Now, there is a power cut as well. At this rate, I doubt we would reach home. It looks like an angel has descended from heaven and is clearing the traffic. Hi, Mr. Devadaas. Hi, Mr. Devadaas. How are you? How do you know me? You saved that little boy, right? You are awesome. Superb. Thanks. You are really great, sir. Why are you clearing the traffic here? It's just a part of service as a concern towards society. - Then you are quite awesome yourself. - Thank you. Hello. The light's green. Move! Oh, the traffic is jammed. Go on. - Bye, Mr. Devadaas. - Wait, we are going. - Stop staring, move! - Very Nice meeting you, bye. Go, please go. Move, go! Buddy, you are looking up at the stars and smiling at yourself like that. Have you touched some voodoo stuff? - Roll. - Tell me, buddy. Ever since I saw that girl at the traffic signal, my heart, and my lips seem to be in a conflict with each other. Buddy! Anyways, why don't you give me some advice on how to approach that girl? Since that girl praised you for saving that boy. I am sure she must have shared that video on Facebook. Roll Reddy. You have a brain as well. Wait a minute. Let's check for it. "Devadaas saves a boy." Buddy, she posted that video. Really? So that means, that was our first meeting. So, the girl's name is "Suvasana". What smell? Suvasana! Hey, she is a physiotherapist. Oh, you mean a doctor for the bones. Idiot. A physiotherapist does not mean a doctor for the bones. Really? Hey, she also uploaded another video. Because of the chemical waste released from this John Wick factory, the people around here are being subjected to severe health problems. Her beauty is very captivating and she has a heart that wishes everyone well. What more do I need to love her? Send her a friend request. Come on. Yeah. Where is my phone? Hey! She has already sent me a friend request. Accept it. Accept her friend request. Buddy. These days, girls make the first move instead of boys. What are you waiting for? Proceed. - Hi. - Hi! - What are you doing? - Nothing, no job. Don't worry, you'll get a job very soon. You should give me some privacy, right? Why don't you exchange numbers? You can speak to each other directly. Maybe it's too soon to ask for her number. Well, let me tell you. I solemnly swear on the alcohol that is favored by millions of people. If you give her your number she will give you hers. Okay. What is this? As soon as I sent her my number she went offline. Maybe because it's late. Perhaps she will give you her number in the morning. Useless fellow! How could you advise me to text her my number? - How could you joke around like that? - Don't hit me! Unnecessarily, I sent my number. - Oh, my God! - Useless fellow! - You ruined everything with your idea. - You, idiot! Did you step on a donkey this morning? Why did you kick me? - Hello, brother. My name is Raja Reddy. - Hello. The child you rescued yesterday was mine. I am in your debt. It's not a big deal. Please sit down. Here you go, dear. I have seen mothers who make tea or coffee for their children, this is the first time that I am seeing a mother who fixes her son a drink. He must have done something really great in his previous life. Maybe that is why he is born with this kind of luck. Sairam... Sairam. - Listen, brother. - Sir? Your father told me all about you. Will you work for me? You'll get a job very soon. I most certainly will, sir. I have a huge wine shop near the city center. If you are okay with it, I will employ you as its manager. My son will certainly take it up. He will. What do you mean? My son is an MBA gold medalist. Why would he work in a wine shop? Mother! The dignity of labor. It doesn't matter what job it is. I must have been blessed by an angel to get a job without having to ask for it. Who knows if it was a blessing or a result of chatting? Bro, this is my wine shop. I'll be back soon. Look after the shop. Excuse me, brother. Give me 180 ml of whiskey. I asked for whiskey. Oh, sorry. I asked for 180 ml. You seem to have trouble focusing on your job. Be careful. As if you are buying me a drink! Move aside. Oh no! Why am I disturbed? Here is the stock. That person is Seshu. He is the one who supplies alcohol. This is Devadaas. He is here to work in our shop. What is this? Why is your shirt tucked in? Are you here to work at a wine shop or at a software company? Take it out. Come on. Seshu... do your business. Hey, unload it. What's the hurry? Are you dying? - Be careful with the stock. - Move it. - Sir, this alcohol is adulterated. - Hey! Shut your mouth, the people are here. Sir, this alcohol is adulterated. How can you tell? Sir, you know about me. I can tell you the percentage of alcohol in the product just by smelling it. This is a hundred percent NSA. Non-Rectified Spirit. The stock is completely adulterated. Seshu, I have told you many times. I don't sell adulterated alcohol in my shop. I am asking you to load your stuff back up and leave. I never take back the stock that has left my gates. I am the one who supplies liquor to the entire city. No one has ever complained. Why do you have a problem? I will not tolerate the sale of adulterated liquor. Do what you want to. You must have seen a vehicle that runs on petrol or even diesel, but I run on alcohol. If I hit you, you will not exist. Till now I hit everyone, but you are the one who hit me. Today is yours. I'll see your end... Not just today. Any day for that matter, I will be throwing the last punch. Why is she not online since yesterday? What's with you? Why do you keep looking at your phone so often? What's in your phone? You are the one who made a mess and you ask me, what's wrong?! Goodness! You seem to have it easy. If your love story is goons, friends are Gods. And if your love story doesn't work, friends will be blamed. Stop your drama. You are the reason for all this mess. All my friends are morons like you! - Hello. - Hello, this is Suvasana speaking. - Who? - Suvasana, sir. Suvasana. Hello, Suvasana. Tell me. Could you please come to my house tomorrow? To your house? For what? I told my parents about you. My father wishes to speak to you. Okay, I will be there. - What's the address? - I will share the location on WhatsApp. - Bye. - Alright. Thanks. Manikonda, Saraswati Colony. Do we know anyone there? One of my college friends lives in that colony. He is a very social guy. He gets along with housewives, socially drinking husbands, little kids in nurseries, and even college-going girls. He'll be in touch with everyone. His name is Rapport Ravi. - Hi, Uncle. Where is Auntie? - Hi. - She is in the house taking a shower. - Really? - Let me go and wish her. - Hold on! You and your efforts to build rapport. Get away. I will come when you are not around. Hi, buddy. Roll, how come you thought of me after so long? Not "mortar and pestle". It's Roll Reddy. Alright, fine. Anyways, this is my friend. He is a part of my soul. Devadaas. He has fallen in love with a girl from your colony. Our colony? I doubt if there is a nice girl in our colony. Her name is Suvasana. That girl? Why did you make that face? If we were to discuss their family, it would become a thesis and can be made into a web series as well. They were presented with the award "Noble Family with global thoughts". Oh! It's an award-winning family. They are the epitome of respect and social responsibility. What do we generally call our mothers? - Mom. - Right? But they call her the lady of the house. Are they daughters or maids? Yes, it causes great confusion. They are vegetarians and teetotalers. Our guy here is a hardcore nonvegetarian and drinks three times a day. - Alcohol? - Yes. That is the one thing that that family cannot tolerate. Alcohol. That is an anti-alcoholic family. In order to avoid the smell when their neighbors drink... he planted flowers all around their house. And even that fragrance was not enough to stop the smell of booze, so that idealistic man named his daughter Suvasana. Even before you enter their house, the smell of alcohol on you reaches them. And your love story ends even before it begins. Gates would be closed. - Buddy, what do we do? - You can only enter after he leaves. Stop the vehicle. Brother, where is this girl's house? This looks like a feisty group. If we go along with them, the chances of our alcohol breath getting caught will be slim. - Do you know the address? - I'll show you. That's it. Wow! Such a nice house. Brother! This is the house. Even before you enter their house, the smell of alcohol on you reaches them, and your love story ends even before it begins. Mother. - Father. - What happened? Something stinks. Yes, that's true. Smells like alcohol. Thank you, brother. See you. You told me that we would go along with them. Whoever arrives first will be the culprit. We are going to be safe then. - Oh! - Yeah! Why did you tie those things around your faces? Do you know John Wick? Did you hear about him? Your daughter has uploaded a post on Facebook claiming... that Brother John Wick's chemical factory needs to be closed. We are here to warn her in person. If you repeat this ever again, I am going to demolish your house and post that on Facebook. Let's go. Hey... Meet you soon brother. Start. Hey, tulsi. Just a pause. Now no one can smell it. Hi, Mr. Devadaas. Please come. Please come in. Please come in. - Hi, Uncle. - Let's have some breakfast. That's alright, sir. I already had mine. Come on in. Hi, Mr. Devadaas. Hi, I got here a while back but saw Suvasana's patients coming in, so we waited outside. They were not patients. They are goons. They came here to warn us. Warning? Goons came to our house to threaten us? Why did you let them go? You should have thrashed them. What can they do? My mom and dad worked in RSS. If my mom had a stick in her hand, she would have thrashed the hell out of 25 people. Really? There were only around six of them. If that's the case, my mom is not needed. My little sister is enough. What can she do? My little sister is a master in martial arts. If she gives her famous flying kick five of them would have severe injuries. My youngest daughter is Aavesitha. Aavesitha? Hi. Young man, you saved that young child. - I am very impressed. - Thank you, sir. That's the minimum social responsibility that people should have these days. You helped an unknown person. We can only imagine how well you take care of your near and dear ones. By the way, where do you work? - Wine shop. - In a wine shop! Not a wine shop. In Vines App. Wine shop, Vines App. What do these things mean? Couldn't you have looked for a proper job? I am going to change jobs soon, Uncle. Oh no, I can't stand with them! Miss. Suvasana, you need to figure out an auspicious day and enter our house with your right foot. What I meant was, my mom has sprained her back you need to come down and give her a session. Oh? Back pain. Why only the right foot? She needs to use both of her feet. Really? Let's do that. Why look for an auspicious day? Let's go right now. This is my house. Mom. Hello, Auntie. - Mom, this is Suvasana. - Greetings. - She is our... - Where is the pain, Auntie? Oh, God! You have sprained your back, right? She is a physiotherapist. Dr. Suvasana. She has come here to treat you. Why does your house stink? There is a new spray called "Mansion House". We've been using it. It doesn't smell nice. What is this, son? Oh, okay! Oh, God! Wow, that's some performance. Mr. Devadaas, don't you think there is a mismatch between your mom's reactions and the areas my sister is focusing on? Even you guys could figure that out. Don't you think she would know? Mom seems to think she is doing a fabulous job. So, let her. What happened? - Back pain. - Since when? Call the doctor. Sairam! Uncle. She is not in great pain. Don't worry, it will reduce. What is this? Why is this room filled with bottles? Why don't you decorate the room with all those bottles? It will look quite good. Looks good, right? It's quite nice, Uncle. I knew it. That is why we decorated it this way. Wow! This girl looks really cute. It's not a girl. It's a boy. My son. My darling. He looks really cute. He used to drink milk. But now... He is drinking decoction. Decoction. Hey, can't you control your mouth? You just have to look at me once It's enough You just have to smile at me once It's enough You just have to take a step with me It's enough Reply just once, it's enough Put a smiley in the message once It's enough Just give me a missed call once It's enough You just have to be with me I will not wish for any other blessings You just have to be with me, it's enough I will not wish for any other blessings It's enough, enough, enough I want just this much That's enough for me It's enough, enough, enough I want just this much That's enough for me You just have to look at me once It's enough You just have to smile at me once It's enough You just have to take a step with me It's enough Reply just once, it's enough Put a smiley in the message once It's enough Just give me a missed call once It's enough - What is that? - It's a guava leaf. Why do you always chew that? It has calcium, magnesium, and phosphorous. The doctor told me so. Alright, fine. Let's go. Every morning, you start my day By changing your DP And that's enough It doesn't matter even if the sunlight and the moonlight come and go I am always in the love light It's just enough if you come To the coffee shop It's enough if you come To the movie theater If you come if I call you, that's enough If you come to the place I called you That's enough It's enough, enough, enough I want just this much That's enough for me It's enough, enough, enough I want just this much That's enough for me I don't want an apology Nor do I want any thanking I just want you to speak the language Of your lovely gaze It doesn't matter the distance Nor does the destination matter to me I will accompany you like life Let's meld our hearts together And enjoy our time together wholeheartedly Let's meld our souls together And live together as soul mates It's enough, enough, enough I want just this much That's enough for me It's enough, enough, enough I want just this much That's enough for me Did you not see the way he spoke? Get down. Buddy, you stink. - No, I don't think so. - Idiot, I meant Suvasana. - Hi. - Hi. I am going to a village for treatment. If you are free, why don't you join me? How can I not accompany you when you ask me to? - Which village? - Pochampalli. That is an ideal village. That is an ideal village. Not a single person in that village drinks. There isn't a single wine shop in or around that village. I need to make some preparations before I join you. Hello. No, it's not necessary. It's just 15 kilometers. We will be back before evening. I don't think he will be able to survive until then. I didn't... I didn't mean to. - You stopped all of a sudden... - Can we have coconut water? Hey you! Stop right there... stop. If you want money, I will give it to you. - Please stop and give me back the bag. - Excuse me! Excuse me! - What's in that bag? - There is Sprite. - Sprite? - Yes. Stop it. I will buy it for you. No. I want only that one. Hey, move! Fast! - Devadaas. Please stop. - Move! You look like you'll run 30 kilometers for something that costs 30 rupees. Get on. - The thing is... - Get on. Okay. What is going on today? FREE PHYSIOTHERAPY MEDICAL CAMP Buddy, tell me. Roll, just buy a bottle of alcohol and get here immediately. I will share the location. What happened? I don't have the time nor the patience to explain the entire story to you. Just shut up! Buy the bottle and come here. Alright. I am coming. Mr. Devadaas. RAGHAVENDRA HOSPITAL This patient seems to have an irregular heartbeat and pulse. The liver seems to be on vacation and the kidneys are protesting. All the organs of his body are setting aside their basic functions and are keeping themselves busy with other things. So, this person needs to be operated upon urgently. If not, I doubt he will survive. - Operation? - Operation, yes. Urgently. Dear, tell the doctor not to do anything. We are coming there right now. - Sairam. Let's go. - Okay, move. Doctor, his parents are asking you to hold off until they arrive. Of course, I will hold off. But can the patient hold on? What if he dies in the meantime? Perform the operation. - Dear Suvasana! - Doctor! - What happened? - His parents are here. - Oh no! Auntie. - It's okay, no problem. It's okay, dear. - As per the reports... - Just be quiet. Dear, just go and get this medicine immediately. Hello. I was the one who tested him. Right, you only tested him. But we are the ones taking care of him for the past 25 years. Dear, go. What's in this? AMRUTANJAN CROCIN TABLET Headache balm and Crocin tablets? Do you know what's wrong with him? You are what's wrong with him. - Dear, you go on. - Go. Give me that! Shut up. Uncle. Here. - Hail Lord Venkateshwara. - All hail. - Hail Lord Mallikarjuna. - All hail. - Hail... the Mountain Lord Narasimha! - Narasimha. He woke up. Doctor. Uncle. I am in the same situation as the doctor. Why did you use headache balm as a talisman? And why did you mark him with crocin tablets? And how did recover after you prayed? Ever since he was a child, Devadaas has had fainting spells. So, whenever he faints we were advised by Amruta... - Amrutananda Swamy... - Amrutananda Swamy to do this. Well, it doesn't matter what it is. I am glad that Devadaas is alive. That's enough. Anyways, you guys managed very well. - We just got lucky. - Stop. - Breath out. - Hello, Uncle. Are you new here? - I am new and so is my boss. - Who is he? Look. He is there. Buddy, your uncle is a SI? Even I got to know now. Hello, Mr. Devadaas. - Hi, sir. - Hold this. Just like the crows on a wire, how did we end up in front of him? - Greetings. - Hello. Are you coming to work? What are you doing here? Very recently, I have been transferred to this area. Does he look like an alcoholic? - Tell him to leave. - Ask him to blow on the breathalyzer, sir. He is a very strict officer! - Okay. Why deny you that pleasure? - Blow. Blow, sir. - What happened? - Sir, that fellow threw the machine, when asked him to blow sir. - Devadaas, I'll come in a while. - Okay, sir. Blow, dear. - I am a minister's son. - Blow, dear. Don't you understand? I am a minister's son. Buddy! So, you drink and drive? Who are you trying to kill? Buddy, if he finds out about you, instead of giving his daughter to you, He will hold your neck. Mr. Devadaas! I am busy. You guys carry on. We are saved, dude. Who is this? He looks like a hero. This is nothing. There is a lot more you will see in the future. Stay quiet. - Hey, John. - Hey, fatso. How are you, man? Brother from a different mother. Mr. John, greetings. Oh goodness. You look super stylish brother Yeah, this is my new style. Latest trend! Yeah! Bojja. How come you changed the trend? I'm just following you. Bojja! Hey, Bojja. You know that, right? We were doing a venture in Shankarpalli. Of course, I knew about it, brother. We are constructing villas on 500 acres of land. Yes. There is a 500-yard land beside that 500 acres of land, Bojja. Our partners are of the opinion that if we can get hold of it, The perfect Vastu would set. I offered to buy that land from the owner for more than ten percent of the market cost. But he refused my offer He showed me his finger. And even warned me, Bojja. He even challenged me, Bojja. Who is that fellow? Does he have the balls to stand up to you? I am going to kill him. Bojja! Cool... According to the book of Mathew... chapter five, 21st verse, I practice non-violence. You know that I don't like things such as killing and murder, right? He threatened me with his finger. So, just remove that finger. He threatened me by slapping his thigh, Bojja. So, cut that thigh away. That's a non-violent man. We can do it. Okay, boys. Let's move. Bring our lads to the pub in the evening. We will have a grand party there. Brother, our lads are country bumpkins. They are a rowdy bunch. I don't think a pub is for them. Okay. It's okay. We will meet some other time. Bye guys, see you. What's up? Why are you all quiet? What is this brother? Why didn't you agree when he said he would take us to a pub? - He is a bit dangerous. - Light, bro. When he is drunk, he isn't human at all. I went once with him to the pub. Come on, Bojja. Come on. This is a 20-20 match. What's this brother?! - It's like country alcohol. - Let's start the Tequila shots. Bojja, I am the winner. No one can defeat you, brother. Bojja. Bojja, I don't like the color of your shirt. It is clashing with the lights of this place. Remove it, Bojja. Please, brother! A lot of girls are here. Bojja, what now? Take my clothes. Here. Brother... fantastic, brother. - Sleep, brother. Sleep. - No, bro. You are my king. Hey! What are you doing here? Why are you here in my bedroom on my bed and beside me? Brother, you were the one who shared your bed with me. I don't even share bread with anyone. How could I share my bed with you? How dare you wear my clothes and my chains and were sleeping beside me? Why are you laughing? When he used his choicest words against me? It's so funny. By seeing his clothes, we can say he is crazy. He is not crazy. He is a psycho. He forgot everything in a drink. Hey dude, she looks damn hot. - Stop. - What happened brother? She is so sexy dude. Brother, that girl? Didn't you go to her place and threaten her? She is a physiotherapist. A doctor. - Physiotherapist? - Yes. Oh, my back hurts. I must have sprained my back. Call her up and tell her to come home. Tell her. I'll call her, brother. - Hello. - Hello, doctor. My brother is in some serious pain. Can you come home and treat him? Listen, if you don't have a doctor's reference, I will not come to your place and treat you. Oh, God! Stop acting. She won't come home if there is no doctor's reference. Really? Call our doctor and inform him. Hey, Suvasana? Oh, Suvasana. Tell me. Hi, Mr. Devadaas. - Hi. - I... I am going to treat a patient at their place. If you are free, will you join me? Really? What makes you think I won't join you if you asked me? Where do you want me to come? You tell me where you are. I will come to you. Really? I am at work. It's at Charminar, Madina Bazaar, Turn to the left and there's my office. Oh! I am right there. Oh no, I gave her the wine shop address. Where? Hi! Hi. Where is your office? Office... This place stinks because of the wine shop. Let's get out of here. Stop. This is the location. She brought someone with her. Brother... You have been trying to get on with that girl. You are preparing a lot. And that girl arrived here with a boy. Who is that? It's the same guy who helped us with her address the other day at her place. - He must be her boyfriend. - Leave the guy behind and get the girl upstairs. - Namaste, doctor. - Namaste. I am the one who called. They were some goons who came here to warn us. Ma'am, the patient is upstairs. Brother, sit down here. You, get him some water and tea. Come on up, ma'am. Look, our brother is in so much pain. Can you shift here? No, ma'am. I cannot move. I am in pain. - Okay. - Oh, God! How is it here? What if I press here? - How about here? - My body seems to respond very weirdly... whenever you touch it, ma'am. Press it, ma'am. Brother, sit down. I'll look into it. Don't treat the girl who came to your house like a toy. Treat them as a sibling. I will skin you alive. Brother, I thought you were going to make the girl scream. Why are you screaming instead? Have the tables turned? This doctor manhandled me. Now, my back is sprained. What did you do to him? Don't shout. Beg her. She will only treat that way. When you don't lust for me anymore, that day I will treat you. Namaste, sister. - Call the doctor. - Yes? Hey, let's go. I heard a scream coming from upstairs. It's because of the physiotherapy treatment. Such noises are normal. Let's go. Who does she think she is? There are many good doctors in Hyderabad. I will take you to them. Let's go. It doesn't look like a sprain. It looks like you were purposefully broken. Doctor Suvasana did this to me. The person who broke you can only be the one who can fix you. I cannot do anything. What is that song?! What is this vehicle? I couldn't find a vehicle for your size. So, I arranged this for you. Ask him to slow down. We reached the doctor's house. Then, what the hell are you doing?! - Go and call her. - Yeah, I'm going. You are the one who did this to you. KSHUNAAKAR RAO NATURE'S ABODE - Brother. - Yeah. Brother, that doctor is not home. Where did she go? - You are bleeding from your nose? - Me? Little girl, call your sister. Ugly girl! Are you deaf? Can't you understand? Call your sister. Hey! Oh no! It's the summer, right? I think it's because of excessive heat in the body. Brother, that doctor is coming. - Call her. - Ma'am. My brother is in great pain. Please treat him, ma'am. Please come, ma'am. Devadaas. Please stay here. Two minutes, brother. Come, ma'am. Come, ma'am. Take a look at my brother. Sorry ma'am, I am a changed man. Please, ma'am. I cannot take this pain anymore. Hey! Moron, I can see nothing but lust in your eyes. - Please, ma'am. - Leave. Go away. Come on, guys. Start the vehicle. You idiot! - Hey, Ramu. - Yes? Do I have lust in my eyes? Brother, of course. You even look at me with lust. Hey! What's going on? The boyfriend of that doctor has parked his bike in our way. Idiot... Ask him why he did that. Hey! What's going on? That doctor's boyfriend is fixing himself a drink. Tell him to do it by the side of the road. What's the need for doing that here? You are just having 90 ml. Why are you showing off? I had a full bottle. If I kick you once... What are you staring at?! Hit him... My back is cured. - My back is cured. - Oh, God! He has grown like an elephant but has a brain the size of a rat. Why are you hitting us? Why are you hitting us? Tell us the reason. Sister, take a look at this video. Tell us why you are hitting us and then hit us. Why are you hitting us? Hey! If the girl I am going to marry gives you a warning, I suspect that something fishy must be going on. Did he hit us because of suspicion? What if he knew the actual truth? If I ever get to know that you guys have... behaved improperly with Dr. Suvasana, I will kill you on the spot. I am Devadaas from Parvathi Nagar. Go. Hi, Suvasana. Why did you hit those goons up? I felt that they were at fault, so I hit them. I love you. Why, because I hit those guys? I love you. Listen to the song Single's song There is one boy, one girl With one heart, one beat Come on. Let's go! You are a single girl and you are a charm You are a single girl and you are a charm My golden girl Why don't you mingle with me Why don't you mingle with me You spin me around, you charming girl You are a single guy, my fair boy You are a single guy, my fair boy Why don't you mingle with me My weirdo You are the one who makes me Tingle all over Dad!

Mingle Single, mingle, double You are a single girl and you are a charm You are a single girl and you are a charm My golden girl Why don't you mingle with me? Mingle with me We have been waiting here for over an hour because you were the one who kept pushing for a party to celebrate the success of my love. He is leaving the country, he is going to give us a party. Hang up! Sorry, bro. What do you mean, sorry? He apologized, right? Why are you hitting him? Hitting him? You will not be spared either. If you think you can get away just because you have the physique and powerful people backing you, and start picking on someone or the other, you are in for a shock when you meet people like me. You will be left with only one hand to fulfill all your bodily functions. Wow! You hit the person who hit me, bro. You are my friend, I love you. No! No way. We will have a big party. This is a 20-20 match. I am its undefeated champion. Come on, let's start. - Cheers! - Cheers! Bro! How... You are a winner. What stamina! What is the secret of your stamina, bro? Secret, right? I shouldn't say it. Hey, bro. Amazing! Okay. Let's go to my place. We will have a grand party. Come. Sir, it's alright. No. - Come on, friend. - Sir, my friend. - It's my party and it's my home. - Sir, listen to me. Not like that. - Namaste, sir. - Kamal. Vimal. - Sir. - Hello. He is my friend. Come inside, my friend. Sir, it's better if you stay out rather than come in. My boss is a very big psycho. Who is a psycho? You take my money and you talk shit about me? - Sir. - Come on, my friend. Forget about all that nonsense. Oh, God! If he hit a ball out of the window, we need to play hockey with that one. Ramesh, there's some noise from upstairs. Come on, we will see. Hey. Instead of a ball, how come a bat is here? How is it that tomorrow's match has already started? - Yes, man. - What could have happened? - How dare you hit my boss? - Hey! No. He is my friend. Don't hit him. Brother. Take it. Hit me. - What, hit you? - Hit me, brother. Hit me. However much you want! Hit me harder. Hit me. Hit me. Moron, you are drunk. That is why you are getting away with these beatings. If not, it would be another matter altogether. Devadaas from Parvathi Nagar. Hey, brother. Hey, my vice president. Hello... Will meet you soon. Soon. Oh, God! Hey, come. hop on! When did I ask to come? Buddy, this GPS isn't working. I asked for one location and it's showing me four locations. It's not GPS, it's your G. Move! Insurance has expired. Hey, stop. - Hey, stop. - What buddy? - Come on now, blow into this. - Hey! - Look. - Sir. That person does not drink. Let him go. - Okay, sir. - Thank you, sir. Okay - Sir! - Yes? Just his breath is reading 270. If he blows into it, the readings might go through the roof. - 270? - Yeah, check it sir. Sir... - Mr. Devadaas, do you drink? - No, sir. Asking him about this is as useless as asking Virat Kohli if he can bat. January 26th, August 15th, and October 2nd, none of these public holidays matter to him. He drinks 24/7, all 365 days. He was born to drink. Why is this room filled with bottles? The doctor said it had calcium, magnesium, phosphorous, and fiber. Suvasana? Why didn't you tell me that you drink? Suvasana, you got it wrong. Let me explain. The relationship between any two people is based on trust. When that trust is broken, that relationship breaks as well. It's over now. Over? Break up! Break up? Suvasana, let me... Break up! Hey! Why did you come into the bedroom? We didn't come into the bedroom. You came into the lawn. Lawn? What happened to me? You brought some guy last night and called him your lovely friend and a lovely guest. He bashed you badly. Did he hit me? He played PUBG with your body. Who is he? Just like they do in the TV shows, you keep bringing a guest each night. How will we know? Bring me that CCTV footage fast. Bring you what? Weren't you the one who told us to switch off those cameras at night? So that your shenanigans don't get you into the police records? Damn! He drinks my liquor and hits me? Who is he? Where can I find him? I will not spare him! You aren't even sober from last night's drinking and here you are, with that! Sairam. Sairam. What is your prescribed dose? Only 90 ml. If the breath analyzer hit 270 just with a blow, how much would you have had? You are drinking to stay healthy. Not to spoil your health. Let it go, Dad. This is the first and the last time. Of course, we will let it go. But what about that girl who let you go? Son, even her father came to know that you drink. We don't have any faith that he would accept you as his son-in-law. Let her go. Mom, please stop nagging. Buddy, she blocked your mobile number, Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. She blocked you completely. - Just listen to your mom. - Hey. Not like that, son. Son, I worry that you will truly become an alcoholic if you don't let her go. - Please. - Dad and Mom... I told you this before, and I am telling you again. The girl who's going to marry me is not just going to be your daughter-in-law, she should be like your daughter. And that girl is Suvasana. - Suvasana. - Tell me, Dad. There is an orthopedic surgeon, Dr. Ritesh. He lives in the US. Apparently, the social cause posts that you've put up on Facebook caught his eye. His family has proposed marriage. What do you say? As you wish, Father. Okay. Okay. Okay. - Hello. - Ma'am, Sun Blues Hospital's staff gave me your number. - My leg pain is acting up. - Okay. Send me your location on WhatsApp. Alright, ma'am. Sir, are you the one who called? Yes, I am the one. Which leg? - Right leg. - Hey, it's the left leg. You... What can I get you? Coffee or tea? - I don't want anything, sir. - Please don't say that. You must have something. Boy! Get some coffee. Please sit down. Excuse me, have some coffee, please. - No, thanks. - Okay, no problem. Uncle, why are you no longer posting videos of your cover songs on YouTube? Have you been watching my cover songs? Yes. Everyone in our family is a fan of yours. In that movie, Rangasthalam... - that song "Rangamma, Mangamma"... - What a boy he is! The way you and your wife danced to that song is exceptionally good. - Did you subscribe to our channel? - Yeah. I even press the bell icon. Oh, really! Choke me with those very hands! That will solve everything. Uncle, I want to see a live performance of your dance. Deny a fan? Never. - Come on, play the song. - Okay. Like the rainbow in clouds And the raindrop in the mud You hid like a thorn of love in my heart My naughty wish is burning as My beautiful hope is unfulfilled Is it to raise the madness Of love in me or to kill me? You're the girlfriend I wished for The damsel that left me You're a merciless demon And the craze in my heart You're a fish-eyed beauty And a strange sage You're my moonlight in the dark Come to me, beloved girl How do I live without you? Come to me, girl You danced really well, Uncle. Thanks. You told me that you had leg pain. Well, that... It's gone. Don't play these cheap tricks with me. Goodbye. Suvasana, please listen to me. Young man, my payment. If you ask for your payment, I am going to hurt you. You danced as soon as that girl requested! Go and ask her to pay you. Hey, move aside. - What's your problem? - You are my problem. Suvasana, I only hid the truth that I drink alcohol. I never lied that I don't drink alcohol. What's the difference? Truth is when you hide things so that people don't get hurt. A lie is told when you want to cheat people. Suvasana, every day and every moment that I was with you, I had alcohol in me. But, did you ever get into any sort of problem when I consumed alcohol? Did I ever cross my limits and misbehave with you? Just point one mistake out from my end. This drinking habit of mine is indeed bad. But my character isn't. Your character is indeed bad. You know my personality. You know the values of my family. You know what kind of house ours is. Despite knowing everything, you had alcohol when you were with me What kind of a character you are? Cheater. You are a cheater. So, won't you even try to get to know my problem? Won't you listen to my side of the story? No, I won't! What would you say? Drunkards will find hundreds of reasons to justify themselves. Do I have to listen to your stupid justifications? Even the biggest frauds in the world are sincere with the women they love. You don't have that quality. Goodbye! They don't listen to you They just don't Women simply don't listen Oh goodness! Oh, my! Oh, dear! They don't listen to you They just don't Women simply don't listen No matter how much you tell them They don't listen to you They just don't Women simply don't listen No matter how much you tell them -They make you cry and they nag -They make you cry and they nag -They make the guys crazy -They make the guys crazy They say that the ears are made For earrings They say that the ears are made For earrings But, when you tell them golden words They simply say bye-bye They bid us adieu They don't listen to you They just don't Women simply don't listen No matter how much you tell them They don't listen to you They just don't Women simply don't listen No matter how much you tell them Got it? Buddy, this is my story. Brother, all the women in the world are just the same. This is every guy's story. You are the ones who instigate guys to err And you are the one who ensures That we keep on making Those mistakes You make a big deal of small things And distance yourselves from Us you cut ties and leave us And distance yourselves from Us you cut ties and leave us We beg and plead -And you play hard to get -And you play really hard to get They don't listen to you They just don't Women simply don't listen No matter how much you tell them Buddy, they say that a woman's heart is like a mirror. Yes, it is a mirror. But it is blackened on one side. So, they can see no one other than themselves. Well said, buddy. They keep posting pictures On TikTok and Instagram They put on an act for likes and comments For a stranger They laugh and giggle And display their beauty On Facebook and share it And display their beauty On Facebook and share it And for the guys who want to share Their life with them They don't have any time to spare -No time to spare at all -No time to spare at all Please listen Please listen to the guys at least once Please listen Please listen to the guys at least once At least one day, please listen to us My Lord. I, Jojappa John Wick, your innocent worshiper, was beaten up black and blue by some stranger. God, please help me in finding out the address of the guy who beat me up. Praise the lord. Jesus. Hallelujah! My dear children. To make sure all your problems are resolved, God has come to you in my form. Come and tell me your problems. Father. Father. Father. Father. Tell me, son. Your voice tells me something is wrong. I was beaten up by someone yesterday, Father. He drank my wine, beat me up, and left. Oh, Jehovah! Why did he hit you? If I know who hit me, I would know why he hit me. So, if you find out who hit you, would you retaliate and become a sinner? No, Father. According to the book of Mathew, chapter five and verse 21... I am an advocate of non-violence. I won't hit him. But I will just find out why he hit me. Please, Father. I want to know who he is and why he hit me. Meditation is the best solution for many problems. One of the best ways to solve problems is meditation. When you meditate, there's a strong chance that you could figure out who hit you. Father. Father! Oh no! I got the solution. Thank you. - The lord is your shepherd. - Thank you, Father! God bless you, my child. I love you. I told him I'd kick him... look. John Brother. - Greetings, brother. - Greetings, John Wick. - What happened, brother? - What's wrong, brother? - Brother... - Why is your face all swollen up? Oh no! Brother's face is all swollen up. - What happened? - Tell me, bro! I was beaten up by someone yesterday. The mosquito doesn't have the guts to bite you. How dare he beat you, brother? Tell me, bro. I am going to chop his head off and display it. If only I knew, Bojja. If only I knew who he was. How could you not know who hit you? You know that I bring a guest home every day, right? He came as a guest and thrashed me up and left. Imagine the pain one would feel if they didn't know who their father was. The pain of not knowing who hit you... - is quite similar to that. - That's true. That is why, I went to the church and met Father for a solution. He told me to meditate. So, meditate, brother. Let's do it! He is taking the mediation quite seriously. Do you think he will figure out who that is? Figuring out things with meditation is not as easy as sucking on candy. Hey, Bojja! So, have you figured out who it is, brother? Bojja, I saw Mr. Balayya when I meditated. Mr. Balayya? So, the person who hit me is Mr. Balayya? Brother, why would Mr. Balayya hit useless people like you? He only hits his fans. He hits them with love. He hits them with his charm. To be hit by Mr. Balayya, you need to have a lot of luck. I don't think he would even ring the doorbell of a useless person such as you. - How would he hit you? - Ammudam. You are crossing your limits. So, why did I see him in my meditative state? Brother, you are not doing a good job with your meditation. While meditating, you need to train all your focus at your center. I saw Ramdev Baba saying it on TV. Oh! Let's try that. Certain things are to be taken at their face value, dude! Brother, this time around, did you see Chiranjeevi? - Would you like a small peg? - No, make it large. In the village, people are binge drinking toddy. Bro, is there no way these people will mend their ways? The only way is to make a rule that people who drink will be killed. - Yes, bro. - That's the only thing left. Super! Very nice, dear. He keeps drinking while saying that people who drink ought to be killed. And with your job of imposing penalties on people who drink... are enjoying watching it. Very nice! You had alcohol, right? How did he find out? I thought we managed the evidence pretty well. Well, it's because you ate with your right hand and washed your left hand. Did you see that? Even after he consumed alcohol, he never was a nuisance to people around him. Although he has a disgusting habit, his character isn't disgusting. That is a megastar! Maybe I have a bad habit. But I don't have a bad personality. Do you work in a wine shop? Let's make a video call. Hey, Suvasana! Hello, Miss Suvasana. Why are there bottles behind you? Bottles? They are not bottles. That is a poster containing bottles. Lying again. He is lying again and again. Where are you? At the wine shop. Are you in the wine shop or Vines App? Not App, I am at the shop. Just come out once. Hey, surprise! Hi. Get on the bike. Where are we going? Won't you get on unless I tell you to? Of course, yes. I will even climb an electric pole for you. It would be better if you stopped with this silliness. Anyways, where are we going? I am taking you so that I can rape you. Why? Not interested? You, naughty girl! Really? Do you want to? Shut up and sit. Brother, that wine shop fellow is here. Turn the vehicle around. Drive! Ram into him! Come on! Move... Hit the brakes! Hey! Idiot, can't you see?! He escaped. I won't leave him! NEW LIFE REHABILITATION CENTER "New life, rehabilitation center?" Whatever! Here we go. - Nadhirdhinna. - Come! I am coming. - Hi, Suvasana! - Hi, sir. - Is he the one you were talking about? - Yes, sir. - You go to your class. - Okay. - You go to your house. - Okay, sir. Deva... despite all that has happened, I got you here with the intention to change you. Please try and understand my love for you. Pleasing a girl you love doesn't mean you do the things she loves. But rather stop doing the things she hates. For the sake of me, for our love, for our relationship, I believe that you will give up this habit. Suvasana, please listen to me once. After that, you can talk. Deva, we are just 25. At this age, you can make the impossible possible, if you put your mind to it. I will be back in two days, okay? - No, Suva... - Hello! I spoke to you in Telugu and told you to go inside. Get inside... - Now! - Bye. Sir, what's your treatment process like? All day long there will be lectures and in the nights, we use harsher methods. Harsher methods? Does that mean you will hit him? Of course, yes. Beat him to a pulp. No, sir. Please don't do that. Devadaas is very soft. Doesn't matter if he is either soft or hard. It is the same treatment. Okay? Don't worry. Go. Go now... Sir! Oh, God! The virtues of drinking alcohol The taste of liquor If one figures this out liquor Is a blessing It is the habit best friends Inculcate in you If you forget it, it is as good As forgetting your buddies Don't quit drinking! Hey, silence. I said silence! If you drown music and literature in liquor, I will beat you to a pulp. Dr. Nadhirdhinna here. - What's your name? - Devadaas. Oh! You have been living up to your name. - How much do you down daily? - I drink 90 ml three times a day. - Why not 180 ml? - Doctor advised me to consume only 90 ml. A doctor told you to?! Who's that fellow? Basically, I am an authorized drinker. An authorized drinker? "Authorized Drinker Certificate"! I saw cast and income certificates. I saw a birth certificate and even a death certificate. Where can I get this Authorized Drinker Certificate, brother? - Brother! Tell me. - Bro! Even if it costs over a lakh, I don't mind, brother. I want it. Big bro, is this just a local permit? Or does it have national coverage? Give them the address and phone number they will get one too. Sit down you... - I will beat you to a pulp. - Hi, sir! - Hey, Ramesh! How are you? - I am doing good, sir. My dear alcohol folks, he is Mr. Ramesh. He did a crash course here and within a week quit alcohol, He is an outstanding student. - Give him a big hand! - Thank you very much - What are you doing? - I am busy with work. Stupid fellows. Look, he is busy with work. What is it that you do? I am busy drinking day and night. Hey! - Are you joking? - Am I a joker? I am a drinker! Drinker! You told me that if you are unsuccessful in making us quit alcohol, you would return our money back. Give me back my 50,000. I don't have money to drink. My pockets are empty. Ramesh, for the kind of treatment I gave you, forget drinking alcohol. You can't even stand its smell. Are you lying just to get money? Hey! I won't lie and cheat for money like you. - Get me alcohol, I'll drink! - Really? - Get a bottle of liquor. - Yes. Get it. - Here it is. - Give it here. You can go. This stupid cap. Stop it. - How could you drink it straight? - Not just this. If you don't give me the money, I will drink your blood, bastard. Guards, take him outside. Take him. - I will drink your blood like juice. - Take him away. My dear students, let's start the class. Stop the class. You keep assuring stuff like last batch, crash course, and best student. But the reality is he came back and is demanding that you pay back his money. We are not at all confident that you will help us quit alcohol. - Yes, we lost it! - Okay, wait. Oh, you need proof? Guards, get them all to the dark room. I will give them proof. Prove it... Shut the doors. You! Give us all the details of your swindling activities. If you don't remove that board that says "New Life" outside, you will have no life at all. Yes, Mr. Ritesh. Everything is clear from our side for the matchmaking. Sukshma, this is the perfect match for Suvasana. If this proposal goes through, I will be the happiest person. - Father... - Please don't say anything. Father, the thing is... - I don't want to listen to anything. - Please listen. Parents give their children freedom not for falling in love and breaking up. It's so that you can make something of yourself and make us proud. Did you not take Mr. Devadaas to the rehabilitation center? Did you or didn't you? I am not just a father. I am a police officer as well. You agree with your father and you agree with your lover as well. Don't you have integrity? At a traffic signal, if both sides display a green signal, there will be a loss of life due to accidents. Fathers should feel that daughters are their responsibility. Not a burden. But the fear that you might turn into a burden for me has started in me. And so, I decided to get rid of that burden. This proposal is finalized. What's this torture, bro? For the past week, he makes us roam the outskirts. And this area, people use it to defecate in the mornings. And amid all this stench, how is he able to meditate? Hey, shut it! I am feeling thirsty. Get me a water bottle from the car. Here, there seems to be some water here. Take it. Brother, I put some water here but I can't seem to find it. Brother was thirsty so he drank it. What should I use to clean up now? You jackass! You got me the water that he was going to use to clean up? - Oh no! - Dumbo! Devadaas from Parvathi Nagar! - No! - Bojja! - Bro! - I remember him. Start the vehicle! BEAUTY PARLOR TRAINING CENTER Excuse me, brother. - The rehabilitation center here... - That was past. Ever since the alcoholic joined the place, they've changed their setup. - Bojja... - Bro? That fellow lives in Parvathi Nagar. Devadaas from Parvathi Nagar! - Hey! - What? He says it is Devadaas from Parvathi Nagar. Do you think it's the same man who hit us as well? Big bro, there are many colonies in Hyderabad. There must be lots of people with the same name. - Why are you worried? - Why would I get worried? Where is Devadaas's house? Do you mean that tall guy who looks like a movie star? Perfect. Where does he stay? That is the house. I love you, dear. Bojja... go and sit in the car. Why, brother? Drag him out. - If you kill him in a fit of rage... - Heard that? how would I be able to find out why he hit me? So, get in the car and enjoy the music. - Go on. - Come on. Let's go. Buddy, somehow I get the feeling that it's the same person. Big bro, if it's the same person, our brother will be kicked out at once. Look. Oh, God! It's the same guy. Hey! Why are you hitting me? Why? Tell me why and then hit me, bro. Why are you hitting me? Hey, Bojja! - Bojja! - He is calling you. Anyway, I don't know. Bojja, save me. Bojja... John is a very nice guy. - Hey! - He made us sit inside. Move it! - Suvasana... - Don't speak. I believed you and your love, Deva. And you proved that you don't love me. When you love a person, it's not just about living for each other. It's about sacrificing things for your partner. You can't even do such a tiny thing as quitting alcohol. I can understand how much love you have for me. - That's not it, Suvasana. Listen to me. - How many more lies will you tell? The first day, when you lied about your mother's back pain. If I had left you right then, I would not have had to face this day. It was my mistake to have reasoned that lie off as love for me. That is when you took me for granted. You lied to me about working in the wine shop. Everything you told me was a lie. Enough! It was my mistake to have tried to change you. I am so in love with you that I don't mind dying with you. But, you don't have even a single thought of spending your life with me. I hate you. I hate you! Why do you look like a punctured tire that has been patched up? The wounds of the second meeting with the guy who bashed me in the first meet. Did he hit you again? Oh, Jehovah! Did you ask him why he hit you? I did ask him, Father. And because of that, he beat me to a pulp. Oh, Lord! As soon as he sees me, he gets angry and starts to thrash me up. That must mean I must have done something very horrendous. I want to know what it is. Please, Father. Jojappa. In this entire world, something as small as an ant bite and even the birth of a human has a reason behind it. - Do one thing. - What is it, Father? - The image of the man who hit you. - What image? Jesus! I meant a photograph. Photograph?! Got it, Father. Got it. Put his photograph in front of you. Concentrate, and singularly focus on that photo and meditate. It will come to you, the reason he hit you. Wow. Thank you, Father! - Thank you, Father. - Jojappa! Thank you, Father. I love you. - Bojja... - Tell me, bro. I need Devadaas's photo immediately. Fast! Come on, bro! Welcome to my palace. - Come with me. - It's superb, sir! This is the heaven of my home. - Sit down. - Thank you, sir. Tell me about you, brother. My name is Devadaas. I work in a wine shop. What? You look like an educated white-collared employee. Why are you working in a wine shop? - What is your qualification? - MBA in Finance with a gold medal. What! MBA in Finance with a gold medal? I am impressed. And also an authorized drinker. Authorized drinker? What does that mean? I have to have 90 ml of alcohol three times a day, sir. If not... If I miss a dosage even once, I will die. What a kick-ass disease! Isn't this the reason why you can never get drunk? Hey! I like this place. I love drinking from here, brother. - Can I ask you something, sir? - Yeah. You lead such a rich life. What about your life partner? An astrologer told me that I would get a wife - who looks like the moon. - Oh... I looked at the sky for that moon. Instead, I found many stars. I touched all the stars that I could see. But, I didn't find the moon yet. I am a bachelor but not a virgin. Suvasana. - Hi. - Hi. I'm planning to tell Dad about us. You come home in the morning. Okay, Sure, Bro... wasn't that your moon who called you? Can I see the picture of your loved one? Please. Sure, sir. Oh! Truly... She is a beauty like the moon. Yes, sir. So beautiful! Bro, we will enter into a new agreement. You... will have to leave your girlfriend. I will love her and marry her. - Bojja! - Bro! Brother. Do you remember why he hit you? When he showed me his girl's picture, I asked him to leave his love for me. That was the reason why he hit me. That is exactly why he hit me. Even I would hit someone for that wish. Hey, Ammudam! You are crossing your limits. Sorry. Bojja, I want the profile of Devadaas's girlfriend. Bro, I'm a follower - of the doctor's Facebook account. - Yes, bro. One minute. Wow! Super! She is so beautiful! I love her, Bojja! His antics! - Hello, Dr. Ritesh. - Hi, Uncle. How are you? What is this, Uncle? Kshunaakar Rao Nature's Abode? What's a "Nature's Abode"? How silly! He looks a bit abnormal! Anyways, Uncle. Kshunaakar Rao, Sukshma, Suvasana, Aavesitha. What kind of names are these? How funny! Aavesitha! Thank you. Uncle, there seems to be a huge age gap between both of your daughters. True. If you had that fire that you named your daughter with, there wouldn't be a huge age difference. Well, I was simply asking. Wow! Uncle, before going to further discussion, I just want to ask one thing. Suvasana, do you have any love affairs? Who is this guy? How did he get in? Uncle, who is he? - Well... - He... - He is our family friend. - Oh! Hi, bro. I am Ritesh. Orthopedic surgeon. MS from the U.S. My name is Devadaas. From Parvathi Nagar. Please, take a seat. Where were we? Suvasana, were you in love with anyone before? I wasn't in love with anyone. Don't you have any common sense? - Hey! - What? This doesn't concern you. Go about your business. Okay. Suvasana. Get up, please. C1, C2, C3, C4 are okay. Just turn. Turn, please. L1, L2, L3, L4 are okay as well. Just bend, please. - Bend... - Deva! - Mr. Devadaas. - Mr. Devadaas. - Mr. Devadaas, please wait. - Oh no! Mr. Devadaas, please. Devadaas is not just from Parvathi Nagar. He is Suvasana's lover as well. Oh no! Stop! - Mr. Devadaas. - Mr. Devadaas. Just stay put. I will deal with you in a minute. - Once I lock you up in the prison, then... - Uncle. My love for Suvasana is not the kind that goes away after death. It is the kind that never goes away even after I am killed. - Uncle! - She cried for milk at birth. Now again she is crying for you. For an alcoholic! That is the reason for our anguish! Suvasana is mine. If you look for anyone else, or even try to get her married to someone else, I will do the same thing again. Shut up and get out of the house! Get out of my house and get out of my life. Go away. Go! Go. I'm leaving the job. Nothing, sir. I'm just quitting. She is leaving -She is leaving me and going away -Can you call your sister? -She is leaving -Shut the gates. She is leaving me and going away She is leaving My dream is leaving my eyes The rhythm of my heart is leaving me The deity is leaving the temple My smile is leaving my lips My shadow is leaving me My desires are leaving my life She is leaving She is leaving me and going away Won't the waves listen to the stories? Won't the cloud listen to the skies? Won't the foliage listen to the rain? Won't the flute listen to the dictates Of the wind? I am anxious to tell you You are stubborn in your refusal To hear me out Her love is my life And I fear if I lose her I'll lose my life as well -She is leaving -Break up! I hate you! -She is leaving me and going away -Leave! Drink, son. Drink up! Won't you drink? Won't you drink? Won't you drink? - Just wait a minute. Wait. - Won't you drink? Son, please drink. Please. Here. Please. - Bojja. - Brother. This is a nice house. You guys carry on, brother. That little girl must be inside. Little girl? What is this "little girl phobia"? You go, brother. The little girl must be there. - Shut up and come. - I won't come. Hi, Uncle. Namaste. - My name is John... - John Wick. Your vehicle number is 0459. I am the one who charged you at least ten times, for DUI and got your license canceled. That's great. So sorry. I don't remember anything when I am drunk. Tell me what brings you here. I am in love with your daughter Suvasana. I want to get your permission for the marriage. So, I came here with my friends to ask you for her hand in marriage. I can guess what kind of a useless fellow you are by the kind of people you hang out with. I won't give an alcoholic like you, even a glass of water from my house. Why will I give you my daughter? Get out. Go! Uncle, cool. Please. Hey, traffic! You forgot to watch your words. I am warning you. Marry your daughter to my brother. - Oh! - If not... you know about me, right? I will just be back. I'll kill you. Brother, calm down. Leave it to me. You there! Don't you know who he is? Bojja Naampally. He is a beloved friend, a weapon against enemies, and he is his very own government in Hyderabad. - If you don't comply... - Stop it, Ammudam! What is this, Bojja? Uncle's is a soft-core family. Who hit him? Oh! Oh! Hey, Bojja! Oh no! Dear. What the hell is this? They're bashing us like hell. Oh no! Bojja, they are no soft-core family. - Yes, bro. - They are very hard-core. No, Uncle. Thank you. No. I'll run now! You bloody pigs! Hey! If you know how to use a stick, I know karate. I am fully trained! Don't you think we can fight you? Come on! Didn't you go to school? I didn't know! I beg you, please spare me. Oh, God! She seems very dangerous. Oh, God! Save me from the little one! I wondered what they were on about when they feared a little girl. Brother... she is little but she keeps flying around and kicking the crap out of people. Brother, it is difficult to tolerate your thrashing compared to that little girl's. Close it please, close it. I am begging you. Okay. What the hell is going on? All the family got into the fight! I want Suvasana, Bojja. But how? It's been many days since we saw you smiling. The house looks dull. Please forget that girl. I am begging you. Are you Devadaas? - Yes. - Get in the vehicle. - Why? - Just get in the vehicle. What happened, son? Sir. This is my son. - What happened? - Come to the police station to find out. Sir... What happened, son? I will go to the police station and find out. - Son... - Wait here. I just got him into the vehicle. What charge do you want? Just keep him locked for two hours. You will figure it out yourself later. Sir... why did you bring me here? Go and sit there. Greetings, sir. Sub-inspector... Thank you. Sir, greetings. Why did you bring my son here? Why did you bring my son here? Hey! Do you think you are my superior? And, am I obliged to tell you everything just because you asked me? Go and sit there! What happened? Go and bring fast. - What's that? - Sir... - What's that? - Hey, give it to me. Sir, it's time for my son to drink. Do you realize where you are? Sir, my son is an authorized drinker. He has a doctor's certificate. It doesn't matter what you think. He has to drink. It's time for his medicine. He has to have it now. How dare you do this in the police station and in front of the police officers? You son of a... Uncle! Take the idiot away! Sir! Please don't hit him. He will die, sir. Sir! Sir, please don't hit him. Brother. Just because he was denied drinking for a while, he thrashed all the police officers in the police station. - I am going to file an FIR. - No! I now have a lot more clarity on his stamina. I will pay you and your station handsomely. Just let him go. Let him go. I did not think so I never ever thought that Half of me would set me on fire And burn me I did not think so I never ever thought that Half of me would set me on fire And burn me I did not think so I never ever thought that The sadness in my heart feels alien To my eyes This anxiousness is alien to my heart I am faced with a question That transcends the topic of love This is so weight that my heart can't hold My emotions fail to turn into words Something seems to be choking me up I did not think so I never ever thought that Half of me would set me on fire And burn me Did I ask you for gold and treasure? Did I ask you to get me awards And accomplishments? Did I wish for many things from you? Did I wish for a lot of smiles? Did I ask you to take On many responsibilities? Or burden you with my troubles? Just so that the two of us can become one I simply asked you to let go of one thing Big sister, you love Mr. Devadaas so much. Why do you keep avoiding him? It's because I love him a lot. For my love... I am of the hope that he will quit drinking. Buddy, I asked the SI numerous times... why he beat you up. No matter how much I asked him, he refused to say anything. Buddy, I smell something fishy. I think your father-in-law might be responsible for this. Namaste. With the sole mission of protecting the environment, the Nagarjuna group of schools is introducing the new "Environment Awards". To present this award, the prominent industrialist Mr. John Wick has been invited as the chief guest. Let's look at a short AV about John Wick. John Wick. He is not just a man, he is an inspiration. Through the John Wick Group of Industries, lakhs of people are getting employment directly and indirectly. If there is an environmental disaster, the first person to step in to help is John Wick. That is why, he spends 50 percent of his earnings on social service through his John Wick foundation. Mr. John Wick, please come to the dais. If you raise a dog, it safeguards only your house. But if you raise a plant, it safeguards the entire environment. This is the philosophy of Mr. Kshunaakar Rao's family. That is the reason why this family deserves the prestigious Nagarjuna Group of Schools' Environment Award. Please welcome Mr. Kshunaakar Rao and his family onto the dais. We invite Mr. John Wick to address the audience. Hello, everyone. I am donating ten crores to the CM relief fund for the victims of the Kerala flood. I wish for Mr. Kshunaakar Rao to help me donate that money to the relief fund. BUILD A SOCIETY WHERE NO ONE FEELS ALONE - Me! Why me? - Sir. If someone as dignified and a good person as you helps, I feel that it elevates the cause further. Please. Uncle, you will understand this award function plan tomorrow. Hello. -Hello -It's Mr. John Wick! Please, sir. Come on. - Madam, get some coffee. - I'll just do that. - Please come. - Oh, no! No formalities. I just came here to apologize for my misbehavior. Not at all, Mr. John Wick. Come in, please. Sit down. Come in. Uncle, I will come to the point, directly. Miss. Suvasana, please sit down. Please sit. Come sit. If I ever wanted to get married, there is no dearth of women. But... when I saw Suvasana, I liked her instantly. You keep forgetting the many good things I do during the day and only remember that I drink during the night. I will quit alcohol, Uncle. I will quit alcohol for Suvasana. Even with no one's support, I achieved a lot. If I get Suvasana as my life companion... imagine the great number of things I can accomplish and the many people I can help with her by my side. Please, accept my love. Please. What else is there to think? You and John Wick share the same goal of helping people. There is some truth in his love for your daughter. He seems to be very sincere in his ardent plea. I don't think we can find a better match than him for our daughter. Okay, Mr. John Wick. We will find an auspicious day and confirm the wedding. - Thank you, uncle! Thank you so much! - Mr. John Wick! - It's okay, Mr. John Wick. - Thank you! Father... I have Devadaas in my heart. I am in love with him. You are in love with Devadaas? Mr. John Wick, sit down. Sit down. Miss Suvasana, please sit down. The plan worked out. Uncle... the girl I want to get married to should have only me in her heart. But, your daughter is in love with Devadaas. So, I am of the opinion that you should give her a chance. Both Devadaas and I drink. Mine is a habit, but he has an addiction. To make your daughter happy, I will quit drinking. Ask Devadaas to do that for at least a day. I mean just a day. If he cannot do that, Suvasana should get married to me. Suvasana, are you okay with this proposal? Suvasana is mine. If you look for other matches or try to get her married to someone else, I will do the same thing again! I am okay with this proposal. - Thank you, Uncle. Thank you. - Okay. Miss. Aavesitha. Ask Mr. Devadaas to come here immediately. Alright, Dad. Oh, God! Devadaas is coming. Big bro, it's stuffy here. - Let's go and sit under the tree. - Wait. - Bro, That's right. - Let's go. I am sweating. I will go as well. - Hey, Bojja. Bojja! - Move! See you later, bro! Hey, Bojja! - You! Why are you here? - Oh goodness! He is here. - Why are you here? - Mr. Devadaas. Stop. Mr. John Wick has a proposal. And all of us like it. The thing is if you can stay off alcohol for just one day, I am ready to give marry my daughter to you. Are you okay with this? Mr. Devadaas. Both of us will meet up in a place, that is completely filled with alcohol. We have to stay in control without opening a single bottle of liquor, without paying any attention to what's going on around us, and stay sober for 24 hours. If you can do that, Suvasana is yours. If not, she is mine. - Are you ready Mr. Devadaas? - What do you mean ready? - Who the hell are you? - Mr. Devadaas! Who the hell are you to give me any propositions? If you stay another minute in front of me, I don't know what I would do to you. - Get lost! - Mr. Devadaas. Please! Okay, Uncle. No problem. - Bye uncle. I shall take my leave. - Okay. - Bye, Auntie. - Get lost! Okay. Listen, Uncle. If you can understand my love for your daughter marry her to me. But, don't bring losers and put conditions and try to make it a competition. I heard and saw many great love stories. I saw people leaving their parents, wealth and even lives for the sake of their love. But, he is not even able to sacrifice his addiction for the sake of love. Is he really in love with you? Give it a thought, Miss Suvasana. I am here to try and understand your love. How do you want me to understand you? How do you want me to understand you? Speak! You came to my house, sat in front of my parents, and drank liquor. Do you know how hurt would he be? Even after this behavior of yours, I shamelessly confessed my love for you in front of all. What did you do? You made me a fool. You made me a fool in front of all! Can't you stop drinking for a day for me? Will you die if you don't drink for a day? Yes, I will die. Then die! Even my death is not worthy of you. Hey! I will accept that challenge for you.

Don't hit him. - Sir! - I'll kill you. Suvasana. My son won't die because someone hits him. He will die if he doesn't drink. I am begging you. He loves you very much. No, sir! He is ready to sacrifice himself for you. Please understand, dear. Sir! If children drink and come home, there are parents who thrash them up. We are the kind of parents who thrashed him up if he didn't drink alcohol. Sir, he has to drink alcohol three times a day. If he misses a single dose... he will die. Won't you try to understand my problem? Suvasana, listen to me once. Please. That's not it. Suvasana, listen. Will you die if you don't drink for a day? Yes, I will. He has Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. She is the one who is responsible. Don't know which star we wished upon, she wanted a son like Devadaas. He really is going to die like Devadaas for the sake of love. Suvasana. - Bojja, what is she doing? - Brother. Don't know. Suvasana! - What is this? - Uncle... Dear, Lord. Damn it! What a kiss, ma'am! - Give me a kiss as well. - Seshu... Just a kiss, ma'am. Just a kiss. Hey! - Seshu. - Please, ma'am. - Don't you know why I brought you with me? - Ma'am. What are you doing? Give me a kiss, ma'am. - Seshu. - Ma'am. She is going to be my wife. My fiance. - Hey! - Stay, brother. My son is up now. Do you want a kiss? - Come on then. - Hey! Why did he stab him? I told you he is a bloody psycho. I came here to settle your account But you settled my account. Yes. It's true. I'll settle your account as well. - I am getting out of here. - Me too. Now, I'm just left with you. Come. Come on. Hey! - Give me a 180 ml bottle, please. - Please. Three 90 ml for me! Who keeps pushing me? - Three 90 ml for me! - Sir, you? At the wine shop? Buying liquor? My son-in-law demanded that I buy him a drink before his first night. - Your son-in-law is your perfect match! - Thank you. Hey! What is that? This is a new tradition. They say husband and wife share everything. So... Hey! Now this is 90 ml.
