Mommy! Seas the day. You promised you'd come down. Yeah, two minutes. So, yourself and Hazel will be moving back then? - What? - To the States. Heard you're goin' home. This is home. I hear you're movin'. Ah, you're not staying here, surely. Not after what happened in this house. Why don't you give the hotel a shot. ...outside Dublin? Could be a fresh start for the pair of you. And you'll be helping me out. I'll talk to Hazel. She might listen to her favorite uncle. Here he is, our Prince. How's the boy? There's a good dog. There's a good dog. Expect delays coming out of Dublin and for those of you heading west towards Galway, traffic is flowing nicely. Some delays can be expected, however, as scattered showers roll in from the Atlantic and travelers have been asked to slow down. Especially on the N6 where roadworks are in place. Later we can look forward to more sunshine there's no showers on the way. Here we are. Come on. In you go. Hey. There's a lot of words in that box. Yeah. My husband's a writer Oh, no, not there, go downstairs. You're a writer? Have I heard of you? Ben Slater? Nope. Yeah, that's why I'm teaching now. Beautiful part of the world. Yeah, sure is. Morning racers. Dangerous assholes. One of them nearly ran me over last summer. If I wasn't such a good... Hey. Where'd you find that? Amongst my dad's old things. I thought I'd lost it. Look at this. My nan. My dad's sisters, Kate and Rita. They wanted me to marry a nice local guy. Oh, there's Dave Pearce. Oh, I was nuts about him. Young love. Kinda wish we could go back to that, that feeling. Like to Daisy Vaugh? Ooh, you never told me about her. My first real kiss, seventh grade behind the music hall. I wish we got second lives like we got second teeth. Remember that day? Yeah. We built that sandcastle on the beach. We were also fighting like crazy. You know we got through it. Come on. Serena. I haven't heard from her since the funeral. Let's eat. Prince! - Come on, daddy. - Yeah, come on, daddy. Don't just lie there like a big lump. Help mommy build - What's it called again? - A moat. - A moat. - A boat? - A moat, dipstick. - Ah! - Daddy's a dipstick... Oh, is that so? Well, you just watch this dipstick dig. Molly, get the bucket, go get some water. "Molly get the bucket, Molly get the water." What would you do if I wasn't here? Ahh, run. Run, run, run. - I'm sorry, did we wake you? - What? Cut the tortured writer crap. You're complex, I get it. Jesus. - Flags, mommy. - Oh! What the fuck? The minister's now facing a motion of no confidence after the opposition claimed... "Seas the day." This opens the library, the drama room, my computer space. Can I buy gas with it? You'll enjoy Sacred Heart. We're all very excited to have a real author in our midst. Thank you. Pick it up. We're here today to ask God's blessing as we begin a new school year. So, if you would bow your heads. The Lord is not slow to fulfill His promise as some understand slowness... ...but is patient with you. Not wanting anyone to perish. - You wanna go to hell? - But everyone to come to repentance. And so to bring His plan to fruition He uses sinful men for His purposes. Give of yourself and heaven and earth will move to accommodate your wishes. Ask and you shall receive. Can I have a new car? It's got multiple murders, sex ghosts, dirty jokes, the lot. The Elizabethans love their dirty jokes. I've got a dirty joke. I've got detention slips. Are you supposed to be famous? Google me, if you haven't already. But google "Macbeth" as well, guys, we begin act one tomorrow. "Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow "creeps in this petty past from day to day "to the last syllable of recorded time "and all our yesterdays have lighted fools the way to dusty death." Out of, out of "Brief Candle." Very good, father, there's an actor beneath that collar. Ah, no chance of that now. - Sean Brady. - Ben Slater. Nice to meet you, Ben. Drama appreciation. Now, who's the genius that came up with that one, huh? Who curses you I need the gig? Welcome to the Pleasure Dome, Ben Slater. Do you know what, welcome to Ireland for God's sake. I've actually been living here for... You know, this school has its fair share of the living dead but the majority of them still have a pulse. And tonight is the quiz night. You have to come. Hughes Pub, most of the staff will be there. - Oh, you married? - Yeah. Bring the wife. That way we'll all get a good look at her. - Oh, yeah. - Hey. - Hey. - Oh, hey, babe. - How was school? - School was cool. - I went to the mass. - Huh, you? Uh, no, not just me, the whole school. Jesus. I met a priest. He's a bit of a character. He invited us to a quiz night. The whole staff's gonna be there, it's tonight. What? We're opening a hotel in less than three weeks, Ben. - I have so much I need to do. - Well, Ha... Hazel, I didn't come here to hide, we're going. So, the final question for ten pints. "What children's character said "You can have anything in life if you will sacrifice everything else for it?" Who said that? I haven't a clue. - Come on, think, Donald Trump. - Trump, my ass. - I know, he's a fool. - Well, that's what Ivana says. "And dreams do come true, if only we wish hard enough." Peter Pan. Write it down. Hey, we might win this thing yet, huh? Hazel... uh, I'm not sure if you remember, but, um... - Dave. - Yeah. How are you? Wow, uh, t... this is my husband, Ben. - Oh, right. Nice to meet you. - How are you? I heard you moved town, you're, um opening the hotel again, aren't you? God, it's been years. A long time. Are you still... - Single. Yeah. - No, I'm... No, I-I mean, are you still living... Still living here, yeah. I am, for my sins. That's good. Anyway, I should, um... Right, well, anyway, it was good seeing you. And the winner is, by one pint, the Furious Five. Donald Trump! Speaking of which, tell us what brought you two into the hotel business? The glamor. In this place? I doubt it. You're not from around here. My parents were Irish, actually, and, uh... ...I went to university in Dublin. Spent every summer here, since my father had the romantic idea to buy a small hotel on the west coast which my uncle now owns. Which would have been sold if we hadn't stepped in. So, here we are. Any experience in the hospitality business? Pfft, not really, my experience is in advertising. It was. That's how we met, I used to write copy for her. - Man of many talents. - And master of none. So, how does advertising compare to the classroom? More children in advertising. - So you quit? - Yep. We, uh, we sold everything and bought a house in Dublin. And we traveled around the world. I suppose you can do that when you don't have children. What makes you think we don't have children? Oh, no, I just thought. Do you? No. ♪ Seamstress queen ♪ ♪ She's no bigger... ♪ Having a child these days is like buying a car. A lifestyle choice, you'd say. In my day, we didn't have any lifestyle choices. If you were married and you weren't pregnant within a year, people would say... Our child died. ♪ Sure she makes ♪ ♪ The work looks simple ♪ She fell down the stairs and she hit her head. Her name was Molly. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry, Hazel. ♪ There she goes ♪ ♪ My Ringsend Rose ♪ ♪ Dublin town ♪ ♪ Has seen ♪ ♪ None fairer ♪♪ Party's still going on over there, huh? Mm. - You okay? - Yeah. Are we nuts for doing this, coming down here? It's what you wanted. And you'll never let me forget it. I never said a word. You know, some of my best memories are on this beach. You, me and Molly. There's a magic here, don't you feel it? I can hear it. Make a wish. - What? - Go on, close your eyes. Make a wish. Wow, what did you wish for? You know the rules. Mm. You're gonna write about this, aren't you? - Midnight dance. - Twisting on the beach. - Galway Beach. - Galway. That's important. Hm. Don't look at me like I'm made of glass. Fuck me. What is it, buddy? Hm? Hey. Serena? She's drunk. Should we call a doctor? Let her sleep it off. You know what she's like, she always has to make an entrance. "Which keeps me pale, light thickens "and the crow, and the crow makes wing to the rocky wood." The crow, what does it symbolize? Death. Is he still alive? Cut it out, guys. I said cut it out! Excuse me, sir, will you, um, sign this? Oh, it's a big deal. - Jenny, right? - Mm-hm. Jenny. Oh, look. Thank you. You're growing your fan base, I see. My followers are out of control. Listen, I'm organizing a little poker game in the staff room at lunchtime it'd be great if you could join us. - Do you play? - Only in Vegas. Fair enough. Strip poker then? Some of the women are in there divesting themselves of their underwear even as we speak. How the hell did you become a priest? How? Because I believe in Christ the Redeemer and I thought the church did too. So, sue me. One of the good ones, huh? I'm a contrary bollocks. Mind you, so is He. That's why they put Him on a cross. But I am a priest and I know that I have a mouth as big as the Gap of Dunloe, but I am a good listener. You know, whenever you needed to... Yeah, I don't wanna be rude but I just I've got a class coming up. I hear you, I hear you. Serena, you gave us a scare last night. Should she be drinking? Drinking's the least of her problems. Did you see her eyes? She was a mess last night, she was going on and on. What was she saying? How did she even find this place? I don't know. I mean, she took the train and then some guy in the pub told her where we lived and so she walked, in the rain. Okay, as long as we don't leave any sharp objects lying around. So, you've given up writing then? No. Why do you say that? It's just they say we all have one book in us. I don't. No, you too. - We all do, everyone does. - Oh, yeah? We all have at least one book in us. I'm missing your point, Serena. Mm. Maybe you've written yours. Ah. Serena, I read a glowing review of your jewelry online. Either I wrote that or I fucked the person who did. Oh, I think you're being too hard on yourself. I think you're an amazing designer. Thank you. And I think you're gonna have an amazing hotel. I do too. Oh. What are you even doing here? Hazel's doing fine, she doesn't need this. What about me? Maybe I need this. Shall I tell you where the last six... - Don't you... - Shall I tell her? Don't you dare say a word to her. Or what? You'll what? Keep your voice down, okay? What is it you want? - Do you want money? - I don't need your money. - I can look after myself. - Can you? Can you, hm? It happened, but now it's time to... Move on? Is that what you hate me for? You think I don't spend every waking moment thinking about that day? You think I don't feel it the way you do? You really think I don't feel it? Feel what? What don't you feel? Serena thinks I don't emote enough. I'm gonna have a glass of wine. "Seas the day." - What'd you say? - That couldn't be right. "S-E-A-S." Shouldn't that be spelled S-E-I-Z-E? I'm good, thanks. Well, excuse me. You drop that, you're paying for it. Hey. Don't I know you? I don't think so. Maybe. I... I did have a book. Pretty sure we don't know each other. Enjoy your coffee. Sorry, sir. He pushed me. Alright, let's go. You could be expelled for that. Get out of here. Lady Macbeth, what do we know about her? What's she like? She's a tough bitch. She is a tough bitch. But listen to this. "Come to my woman's breasts and take my milk for gall." Woman's breasts. Ha-ha-ha. Gall, what is it? They made Christ drink it on the cross. - Vinegar. - Right. So, she wants the milk in her breasts to turn to vinegar which raises the question, why is she lactating? Producing milk, dickheads. And? Tell 'em why. She's pregnant. "I have given suck and know how tender 'tis to love the babe that milks me." But there's no baby Macbeth in this play. - So? - It died. And since she's still lactating? Just died. A tough bitch, a woman's baby has just died. Enough to drive her crazy with grief. And Macbeth... ...we were told in the very beginning that he was fearless in battle that he would just throw himself at the enemy. Didn't care whether he lived or died. He was heartbroken. And he'll move heaven and earth to make it right again. - Daddy. - Come on, daddy. Don't just lie there like a big lump. Help mommy build... What's it called again? - A moat. - A moat. - A boat? - A moat, dipstick. - Ah! - Daddy's a dipstick. Oh, is that so? Well, you just watch this dipstick dig. Molly, you get the bucket and go get some water, honey. I'm sorry, did we wake you? What? - Flags, mommy. - Oh. The sandcastle. You remember the day we built a big sandcastle? - You, me and Molly? - What? What time is it? Ugh! Where were you? - I tried calling you. - The sandcastle. The one, the big one with the moat, right? And we had the little red flags? What are you talking about? Tell me you remember. Yeah, the red flags, I remember. You wanna build a sandcastle? "Seas the day." I've been seeing it everywhere. It was written in the sand. - On my computer. - What are you talking about? Oh, fuck, you're drunk. Maybe, but it doesn't matter... ...'cause I think I figured it out. I have had the exact same dream now, twice about the day we built the sandcastle... ...except I don't think it's a dream. It's like it's a, a message a message from someone or something. - You're scaring me. - Just listen to me, please. Okay? When I first woke up, "Seas the day" was written in the sand. Tonight you handed me the flag to stick into the sandcastle only the dream ended before I could do it. When I woke up... ...I still had the flag. It was in my hand, Hazel. I don't understand. "Seas the day." It's a... It's like a childish misspelling. It's supposed to be like S-E-I-Z-E. It means seize that day. What if it means seize her? - Who? - Molly. And instead of holding the red flag when the dream ended what I if I was holding onto her hand? What if I could pull her out of that dream? - Ben... - You know, pull her out of that day. - Don't you hear yourself? - No, because we could change it. - We could change the past. - Don't you hear yourself? I know what I saw. Ben, please. I've thought a lot about that day, too. That was the day the boat came round the point and you were out swimming. I've often wondered what would have... What? If it had hit me? Maybe Molly wouldn't have fallen down the stairs? You were supposed to be looking after her. You were supposed to be minding her. Lack of sleep is usually consistent with stress. Your recent bereavement is undoubtedly a factor but rather than prescribing sleeping pills, perhaps... I'm also a teacher. One a night. You hear me? Strictly one a night. - Come on, daddy. - Yeah, come on, daddy. Don't just lie there like a big lump. Help mommy build... What's it called again? - A moat. - A moat. Look, Molly, daddy's diggin'. Daddy's a dipstick, huh? Molly, get the bucket, go get some water. Run. Run, run, run. I'm sorry, did we wake you? - What? - Huh. Cut the tortured writer crap. You're complex, I get it. Flags, mommy. How did you get that? Ah. - Big hug, huh? - Big hug. Don't let go. If I had died... ...wouldn't you try to contact me? 'Cause I'd find a way. I would. I'm sorry I said those things to you. A moat. Time travel? Jesus, Ben, I teach physics, not science fiction. To a particular point. One particular day. I mean Hawking said it's possible he said that, didn't he? Yeah, he also said that if time travel were to ever exist then we probably would have already met time travelers. - Maybe we have. - An infinite universe? I guess anything's possible. Whatever you're working on, it sounds mad I can't wait to read it. You okay? I'm fine. Everybody, just open your books. - You can't just burst in here. - This is important. How do I pull the cameras up? A phone's been stolen. Denise, right? - Bernice. - Bernice, can you help me? Don't know about this. Great, can I? Thanks. - Come on. - What do you think you're doing? Mr. Slater says a phone's been stolen from his classroom. You have no right to access that computer. Mr. Slater, I am asking you for the last time... Give me a Goddamn second, will you? Jesus. Stop. Molly, wait! Molly! Ben. It's the one bit of Latin that everybody knows. Carpe diem, seize the day. Yeah, except it's "Seas." S-E-A-S. I've been seeing it everywhere. It's like the words are haunting me. Look, if you're hoping I'd perform an exorcism... Well, I'm sorry, my friend but the pope relieved me of those duties many years ago. Jesus, you're doing alright, aren't you? Right, here we are. Oi, Ben, come here to me. Go and see a shrink, you fucking lunatic. Hazel? Hazel? Oh, Benjamin Bunny. - Hi, baby. - Hm. Lose the shoes, join the party. I found it in your jacket pocket. Weren't you gonna share? I confiscated that from a kid at school. - Ooh. - Hm, confiscate some more. - It's good shit. - It's so good. Alright, give me some of that. Hm. Jesus. How long's it been? - A long time. - Hm. In college we used to smoke every single night. Not every single night. I mean, m... maybe you did but I... I was innocent. You were never that innocent. People always thought I was the wild one. Because you are. Give me that. Serena has a secret. No. No, Hazel. Serena is not who you think she is. Serena is not her real name. Oh. Really? What's your real name? Rose. Rose, okay. Yeah, I named her Serena on the first day of college. - Mm-hm. - Uh-huh. A rose by any other name... ...is still a rose. Ah, I love chocolate. Who knew chocolate could taste so good? We have to put this on the menu. I always think of my mother when I bake. Hey, what's wrong? What is it? The dancer. What's going on? Hey, it's okay. Oh, it's okay, it's okay. Shh. There's something she's not telling me. Something terrible. I asked her why she cut herself and you know what she said? Hm. That she was doing penance. - For what? - Uh... You need to be nicer to her. - I'm always nice to her. - No, you're not. I know she can be hard work sometimes. You think? You know, in her eyes, I had it all. A beautiful house, beautiful child. Perfect husband. And I did for a while. She's here because she's lost... ...and I'm glad she's here. No, really, I am, it's... It's given me perspective. You know, there were days when I didn't think I could go on. It would have been so much easier to just... You remember how many pills they prescribed me? Don't talk like that. But I don't feel that way anymore. I feel like I can live again. There's something I wanna show you. What? Come on. No, you tell me first. You trust me? You're wasted. Answer. You trust me, right? Yes. Come, you won't regret it. You're crazy. Come on. Where are we going? Right here. Careful. Okay? - Okay. - Babe, it's a little cold. Stay, sit. Okay, in the dark? Ah. What's gotten into you? Remember when you said there wasn't enough magic in the world? Yeah. Okay, this is not what I had in mind. Promise me you won't get mad. Just hear me out. Something's happening, Hazel. Something I can't explain. The day at the beach. Something from that day is still with me. I keep getting pulled back to that one day and I don't know why. I know this sounds crazy... ...but if you're with me... I need you, Hazel. Do this with me, please. What do you want me to do? Come. I'm not crazy, Hazel. I don't know why... ...maybe it just doesn't work with two people. But I've been there. I've been to a place where Molly's still alive... ...and we get that second life. Don't you think I want that? I want that more than anything. What I wouldn't give for an ordinary minute in a universe where Molly isn't dead. But she's dead, Ben. - Big hug. Ugh... - What are you doing? We have to get off the beach now. Don't go, stay with me. Daddy? Don't go. - Come on. - Ugh! - We have to get off the beach now! - What's wrong with you? Come on. Oh, no! I don't know what I'm supposed to do! Hazel. Hey! How did I get this scar? Ben, we have the opening tomorrow. - I need to sleep. - The scar, how did I get it? You fell on the beach. The day we built sandcastles. You don't remember? Guess they all took a wrong turn somewhere. Mr. Miller is taking your class. Yeah. This hasn't been an easy time for you, Ben, has it? I know you've been under a lot of stress. Am I about to be fired? You confiscated something in the yard a few days ago. A controlled substance. What did you do with it? I smoked it. - You... - Smoked it. You're not making this easy, Ben. Let me fix that for ya. I read your book. "A Reality Delusion." Nice title. Some weighty themes in there. The futility of existence. All of us trapped in the meaningless universe. A little hackneyed. But the age old themes have such a bearing resonance don't you think? What, a guy who dances with furniture shouldn't read? It's just my face when I meet someone that's actually read my book. Don't be so hard on yourself. You can write... you can. But you're overthinking everything. Oh, yeah? Yeah. I mean, there's you... ...struggling with the weight of your pain... ...grappling in the shadows without understanding the forces governing your existence. We all inherit our own early pathway our course is set long before we are. But sadly, some of us go astray. But those who do, pay a heavy price. And all come back to the fold. What is it? Please tell me. It's something so immense it can't hold a name. You just embrace it, Ben. I've tried... I've really tried... ...but I'm doing something wrong. I don't know, but... ...it never brings me back to that day. It's always a different day but I can't change anything. I just can't... change anything. Our course is set long before we are. Oh, my God. What happened to you? I called the school, they said you quit. What's he doing here? David is a psychologist. He's been helping me and I think he can help you too. Ben, if you wanna talk, we can talk. What did you tell him, Hazel? Did you tell him that I'm going crazy? I told him you need help. - Because? - Because you do, look at you. Because I'm crazy, say it! Yes, you're crazy, and you're making me crazy! Don't you see everything is falling apart? You need help, Ben! No, I need support from you, from my wife. - I can't, I can't do this. - It's okay. It's okay. - It's okay. - Get out of my fuck... Ben! Ben, just let me help you. Just get out of my house. Man, just think about what you're doing. He's just here to help us. We don't need his help, okay? We need... We just... Don't you hear that? Tell me you hear that. Does anybody hear what I'm hearing? Please, I think you should all leave. Ah. Tell me you hear that! Tell me! - Ben. - Do you hear it? Where's, where's the fucking thing? What are you doing? Where the fuck is it? Yeah. What have you done? Would you fuck me now? - Don't, Serena. - Would you? You wanted to fuck me so bad that day... You wanted to lick every inch of me... ...that's what you said. That's what you said. Serena. Hazel. I'm so sorry. Hazel? Hazel, open the door. Hazel! Haz... - Jesus Christ. No, baby. - Oh, my God. What did you tell her? Huh? I didn't. Hold on, baby, hold on. Mr. Slater. - You're the guy from... - Kevin. Kevin Gunne, pleased to meet you. Are you okay? Were you in an accident? How's Hazel? - How's she doing? - Your wife is fine. Were you able to get that shit out of her system? This shit? Terol L-glutamate also known as folic acid not exactly overdose material. Hazel's been depressed... ...mixing a lot of medication... She's anemic. Nothing to panic about she's got a nasty bump on the back of her head from when she blacked out. Why don't you sit down again? I'll be right back. Can I, can I see her? Sorry to interrupt, Mr. Slater, do you mind? I'd just like to... Yeah. Have a look. Where's Serena? Now, the other eye. I just can't. I just need... Ben, what are you doing here? Everything okay? Ben! Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry. I killed her, Sean... ...the same way I killed Molly. Ben... Oh, Ben. But now I know. I know. You remember the reading? At mass, the day we met? "Here is my redemption." This is my wish. Come on, daddy. Yeah, come on, daddy. Don't just lie there like a big lump. Help mommy build... What's it called again? - A moat. - A moat. A boat? A moat, dipstick. - Daddy's a dipstick. - Ooh. Oh, is that so? Well, you just watch this dipstick dig, huh? Get the bucket, go get some water. "Molly, get the bucket, Molly, get the water." What would you do if I wasn't here? Run, run, run. I'm glad you could join us. Drop the tortured writer... Flags, mommy. Oh, yeah. Nice trick. What's gotten into you? Come here. Ah! - Ooh! - Ah! Daddy's gonna go for a swim. Yeah, as quick as you can, please. Yes, sir, it's on the way. Thank you. Faster! Go faster! Hey! Ben, look out! "The day..." In the name of the Father and of the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen. "Give them eternal rest, oh, Lord "may your perpetual light shine on them forever. "Almighty God, our Father "we firmly believe that your son died and rose to life..." Are you sure you can let the place go? Yeah, too many memories. Hey. Come back here. Prince? Ben.
