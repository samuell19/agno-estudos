It's hell not to have a car in Telemark. No, I must redo this. It's hell to have a car in Telemark. That was at least what Otto Staalesen experienced. He owns an old Opel Diplomat. A 1969 model in mint condition. Yep! Had it not been for that car, Otto would probably still be on his way. But now he's been totally lost for over a year. Why do I sit here in thickest Telemark and keep thinking of Otto? Why do I type his name and get his face up on the screen? Do I really sit here having a bad conscience? Not my fault that he got lost in Telemark. He could've stayed in Oslo, where he belongs. And it was at least not my fault he answered the phone that day. HALFWAY TO HAUGESUND Hello? Yeah, it's me. Otto's Speedway Action Organ speaking. Hm? Yesterday? No, listen... Isn't today yesterday, then? I mean, relax... I'll be in Haugesund in a few hours. Okay, bye. Damn stress... People calling in the middle of the day! It must be a different time zone there. Funny having a comeback at my age. It's like starting at the bottom again. When you start at the bottom, it can only go one way! And that's straight west! Strictly speaking, Haugesund is just a stopover on the way to New York. Otto has, of course, not been thinking of walking all the way to Haugesund. He has surely thought of driving the Diplomat. But his father pawned it before he died. So now the car is stuck, and Otto is broke as usual. The Diplomat is my patrimony, dammit! I have the legal right to it. It's no problem. I'll just go right in and tell fatso to deliver the car to me. Get yourself together! -Has your old man... got his finances in order? -Not quite, but I have a job in Haugesund, so you'll get the money on Monday. It's very important for me! Oh, come on! I'm in a hurry! You'll get no bargain here! -I didn't ask for a bargain, I just... Look here... Can't you take this as a deposit? It's a Rolex. A Rolex! Thanks. ...which are used in Telemark, and are thoroughly hand made shoes. But high-heeled patent leather shoes, I don't like. But can't we be national in the middle and urban on both ends? Yes, I think that was a very fine, eh... ...full investigation of 55-year-old Per Gunter, who's been lost for over a week. Per Gunter travelled from Lillehammer to visit his family in Stavanger. The first witness reports of him were made in Morgedal, Telemark, August 1st, says Anders Andenes at Lillehammer police station, to NRK. Good day, my name is Amund Fisjord and I am mayor here in Notodden, and on behalf of myself and all Notodden, I wish you a very good vacation. Grocery stores, clothes stores, shoe stores, sport shops, newspapers, magazines, and online. 2 km outside Notodden on highway 11, to the west coast. Otto must've wanted to ask for the way to Haugesund, but there was nobody to ask. Not a Goddamn hillbilly in sight. No one to ask about the way. At this hour, no Telemarkers are home. Not at work either. They have other things to do. They're not going anywhere, they just enjoy themselves cruising around at a crawl. It's in perfect harmony with their slow life-rhythm. If there's anything a Telemarker really can do, it's to pass the time. Do you know if it's far to Haugesund? Oh, you're in a hurry? -Yes. You should take the shortcut through Jommersdal then. Yes, I think that's the best. You just drive the European Highway until you reach a sharp turn. Then it goes a bit upwards and then it goes downhill to Flatdal. Well, this you'll see, you know, everything is flat there! Hallvard Flatland comes from there. But you must just drive downhill till you come to Nute. Turn off there. H?ydalsmo and Rauland it says on a sign. That's the shortest way. Drive that way. Tommy Ekman, what's that? It's Swedish, something like Svenskebandet. Right, yeah. That won't be of interest. I'll take that one. -Draumkvedet? -Yeah. Opel, I see? -Yes, Opel Captain, '61 model... that we have restored and fixed up here. And used parts from a wreck back here. It was involved in a fatal accident around Haugesund. So we used different parts on this one and now we consider ourselves finished. And I suppose the results aren't so bad? -So it's a real ghostrider, this then? Yeah, I guess you can say that. H?ydalsmo and Rauland it says on a sign... or two. Yes, right... We'll have to check the map here, I guess. Let's see... Who is it that's torn up the mapbook in the Opel? Could it be his father? Well, I don't know. And for Otto it doesn't matter, as long as he gets to Haugesund. A damsel in distress! Poor little one... I better lay a bit low. If she finds out I'm a musician, she'll probably go crazy. A superannuated punk rocker from Oslo was kind of the last thing I expected. But I needed transportation, so I couldn't exactly be picky either. Were you not on the way to Rauland? -Haugesund. That's right west, over the marsh. Are you from Oslo? Well, south or west will be the same now anyway. Can't you just drive southwards? I'll show you the way. -Jump in. If the engine in the Mazda hadn't broke down, I'd have never been standing here. I would probably never have met Otto. I saw at ones that the Diplomat are from the '60s, but I don't think Otto knew what treasure he drove around with. Tell me, is the shortcut to Haugesund? -Yes, if you'd had a map you'd see it. Do you have a map, then? -No, I'm from here. Yes, it's quite pretty here. Like a mix between The Shining and Deliverance. Mikkel Staalesen? A Kongsvinger name, isn't it? That's my father! In 1969 when he bought this car, it was just shit cool. The coolest thing from the Germans since Terboven. Do you wanna come with me to Haugesund? No, no... that'll have to be some other time. There's a pretty nice room at the Hotel Norge there. And... I need a groupie, you know. Otto's Speedway Action Organ! You're not going over the mountains today? -No, why? Aren't you going to Haugesund then? -Yes, but I'll take the main highway. Yes, but that's over Haukeli Mountain, you know. -Haukeli Board? Ah, yes, sure! It's closed now anyway, so you won't get across it. -Is Haukeli Board closed? We'll have to take the Hardanger Splinter instead then. -Yeah, but... if you have to get to Haugesund today, you better drive around. Drive down to Dalen, through ?mli and then to Evje. -Nah, that's not good. No, but it's the only option you have. Really, you think so? I'll show you, I'm going the same way. -Yeah, why not! Roots Research, Farida. What are you doing then? Roots Research? Right, yes, uhm, I see... Yes, and Hege, she had to leave in '70, right? Yes, I guess she had to. -Yes. Could your great-grandfather then have left together with her? Yes, that's possible. Well, don't you think so? -Yes... I suppose so. I've talked to people who say he came back again, right before the turn of century. -Yes, that might be. Do you know who his father was? Was he the priest in L?rdalen, or the boy in Midtgarden? The priest. -From Midtgarden. Let me take some photos of you. And now, turn that way. Pretty smart of you... running a kind of complete Mengele package with skull-drilling eye colors, and the whole thing... like some space boogers. Can you prove anything with it, or? -Not "prove", it's not about that... I just make use of it as a tool. What really counts here is to have all the church books, censuses and things like that. All those things I keep on the hard disk, and then I cross-check it. I guess there's some money to grab on such a stunt. -It's not a stunt! I don't trick them. My clients get exactly what they pay for. They collect roots, I simply give them relatives. I give them an identity! You... turn left here please. Everyone from Telemark can't be related. Hottentot, Eskimos, Mandarins, Pygmies, Swedes and... -Yeah, why not? Must look at the big picture, you know? - Right, yeah. You mean Adam and Eve came from Drangeda? Jesus and Mary from Jomfruland? Funny theory. Hey, can you turn right here? I'm just going to collect some information up there, you see. Can I borrow your phone for a moment? Yes, right through that door and on the left. Farida? -Hm? Otto, an organist. Organist, you say? I just heard the Polish guy who plays at the hotel is ill and needs a substitute. He's on his way to Haugesund, but the mountain road is closed, so he had to go through Evje. -Farida... -Hm? You see, Haukeli Mountain was snowed over last night, so I have to take a trip down to Evje. Yes... I'm in the middle of Telemark right now. Pretty fed up, hopeless situation anyway... What? Don't you believe me? Listen to this then, silence... Did you hear that? Hello... hello? Damn it! I won't go with you to Haugesund. -I don't need you either. You don't feel like you're being fooled? They close the mountain in the summer too, you know? And you set yourself up for it, really. -Oh, yes, it suits me perfectly. I was thinking of going to Dalen anyway. But where do you think you're going, then? -I'm not going any further, I guess. Here? -Yes, here. Like to borrow the phone? -No, thanks. Bye, then. -Bye. I think it was an advantage for Otto to drive in the dark. Then nobody could look closer at the Diplomat. Under the hood there was hidden a Chevrolet engine. A real V8. Driving around with this sought-after collector's item in Telemark is something you do at your own risk. My God! What is this thing doing here? Hey! What are you doing here? Didn't you see the sign down there? It says "Am-cars only". This is an Opel. You have no business here. -Can't go on like this, or it'll be a Lada next! -Get rid of it, get it out of here! Won't it start? -It won't start! -Get up the hood, come on! Come on then, get it up! Hey shit, a Chervolet! We could probably help you fix it. Well, that would be damn great. -We can take it down to B? on a trailer. Hey, Andre? It's okay that we help this guy, right? -Sure. We'll do that, we'll bring it down and fix it for you. Do you think it'll be expensive? -No, no, we'll do it cheap. This we can do, it's our hobby. We have parts in our garage. We don't have to order anything. -Great, that's real nice of you. There's a real carburetor here... If there's anything the Am-car boys really now, it's how to cruise. They glide resistanceless through the landscape, with accurate clearance between the cars... so that no one else can get in between. Elements from other cultures, like rice-burners and German trolley cars, must never sneak in and pollute this perfect Telemark image. Did Otto reflect on how strange it was that his German trolley car was allowed to participate in the cruising? Maybe he sensed something. But Otto just sat there, thinking about his empty bank account. If he couldn't pay for the repairs, he'd probably never get out of Telemark. Can you stop at the post office? I need some money. That'll be tricky. We're driving together down to B?! I'll have to pay you for the Diplomat, you know. Okay, what we do, we drop you off here, and then you come after us down to B?. But if anything happens to this car, you'll be removed from the National Register. Have a nice trip, Hopalong. If you steal the Diplomat, I'll keep this lollipop wagon of yours. Postbank accounts are some real shit! Not a chance to overdraw! But the time of miracles is hardly over, here in the Valley of Saron. I'll just say it as it is. There are millions in this account, you know. Nobody moves! Trond Vidar, what are you up to now, then? Bullshit! Give me money! This is unwise of you. The money! We don't have much money here today, but you better have what we've got then. Hi, is it Inge at the police station? It's Bilje from the post office. Yes, Trond Vidar was just here and robbed me. He didn't get more than 3,000 kroner. He went down to Seljord in the Datsun just now. Yeah, you'll probably meet him right down the road there. Alright, bye then. Well, there won't be much money for you either. Your account is empty. No, there's a lot of money there. -No. What? Very well, bye then. -Have a nice day. Hey... it's from Seljord, give your position. Over. -Hi, there! Highway 11 over Haukeli is still open, and the driving conditions are good. I'm down at the bridge. I better catch him before he gets to the B? road. Over. Yes, I think you can move up ahead now. Trond Vidar will probably come out down at Kimle. Over. Heh! Yes, that's true, he usually drops out in that turn. Over. Heh... yes, there he went! He got a soft landing. ?sleiv, did you see what I saw? Over. -Yes, shit! Over. Did you see Tarjei's Impala passing by? -It wasn't Tarjei who sat in it! Looked like a city man! Over. Yes, maybe it was! I'll keep an eye on him. Over and out. Hi. Are you on a long trip, or? -Morning. Hi... uh, I'm wondering about the way to... Eagle Car Club. Yes, well, there's many places called that here in B?. But you could try over there at Langk?s and H?rte. -H?rte? Yeah, drive down to the traffic circle, then right to Kvarv, drive 300 meters to where there's a sign saying "H?rte". Drive that way till you get to central H?rte, then Lank?s is right behind the woods there. Okay. You haven't got original tires on that one? "H?rte groceries" Do you know where Lank?s is? Hi. I'm looking for the president. -What president? -Of the Am-car club. Ole Johan Johansen? He lives over there. Down there in that basement. -Okay, thanks. Well, here it was nice... to be in the middle of the shit hole. Now it's time to thump the table. Where have you taken my car now, then? Well, there's no room for it in here. -I asked where you've taken it! There's something wrong with the engine, so I have to get some new parts for you. I guess we should manage to get something. -That's too weak! Because I picked it up just yesterday. It'd just been fully restored, cost me 15000 Kr. So your story's just too weak! Well, the worst things are quite diffuse I think, because it looked pretty bad. So we can get the tops from America, and the "bops" down in Bamle, so it'll cost you more money. Okay, then. Yes, of course, it costs money when "the tops come from America, and the bops from Bamle". That's no problem. I can just step in for the Polack down at the hotel. I can play hillbilly music till the seizure comes and gets me. It was terrible how you played! And right now our dear Orchic is well and back, so a good further trip to you. Yes, yes... There must be a market for more than Harding fiddle and "Sputnik". The thing is just to introduce yourself. Say, is your boss in? -That's me! Okay... I've got a demo here. Suitable to wiggle some hillbilly flesh. For the weekend or something. So then I take the door and you do the beer sale? I have posters too. If Otto had got himself a map, he would have seen there's no shortcut out of Telemark. It seems like the roads follow the twisted landscape. But it may also be the opposite. Or both... It's not necessarily meaningful that the roads lead out of Telemark. Most likely, their purpose is not to lead anywhere at all. But Otto hasn't become a real Telemarker yet. He still hasn't enough of what Aasmund Olavsson Vinje called "tvisyn" (ambivalence). The whole point of a labyrinth is to get lost. Nothing abnormal about that. Everyone gets a bit lost here. But that's how we want it. We thrive on it. It was no coincidence that Otto ended up in L?rdal. Sooner or later, everyone ends up in L?rdal. The road, in fact, ends here. From here, one must take the lakes and the canals in use. Otto had then come to the end. If he should go further now, he'd need help from above. Bj?rn, priest in the village. It's Otto right? -Yeah, that's right. Come on out in the sun a while. Yeah, why not strech my legs a bit. -Yes, a good place for that. I've heard a lot about you. -Oh, really? Farida just stopped by and said you're a wizard on the organ. Very nice girl. -Sure, not bad. I thought maybe, uh... we could start practice today. There's a funeral tomorrow. Agnes Buen Garn?s shall sing in the Church, so then.. Shall we practice for the funeral? -Yes, you have to play there. Play? -Yes... I thought... that's what you do best? But, as a rocker and such, you're probably sceptical of the Church. But... you should be aware that we've changed a lot. In the old days, Harding fiddle was an insult. It was an instrument of satan, right? And now it has a place of honor in the church. And that's how it might be with rock as well. Tomorrow we'll manage with the Psalms, but... If Jesus had lived today, I think he probably... well, yes, he would probably have been a rocker. The vocalist in Burzum? -Yes, maybe so. Burzum... I haven't heard about that. I'm very concerned about Christian rock, you know. Much good there... Well, here they bring in one load of tourists after another. The church hasn't been that full since the last funeral, I guess. But since Jesus was a rocker, it'll probably be a full rave party here. Welcome to this years coolest ghost show: See Telemark and die! If I'm going to be stuck in this church asylum much longer now... I'll probably get in the pencil case myself. (tourists speaking German) Now, look here! There's that computer witch from Karachi or something. Watch out for her. She's capable of putting you right into the hard disk... and selling you as a deceased relative to some American tourist. The only thing I'd found for Bertie were some paltry great-great grandparents. "Came and went Never took, never received" "ding dong." Yes, yes. She won't come with me to Haugesund, that one. Wow, wow! A chick or two in costume, that would be nice. I think I'll go for it. Two in the front, two in the back and one in the trunk. Two in the front, and.. If Bertie had had more cash... I could've surely found a third cousin or something. Telemark is actually like a hologram, where you see both what is there, and what you think is there. Otto never reached Haugesund, and not New York either. But why should he, when everything is available in Telemark? After four days as asylum seeker, Otto needed something more than tourist's milkmaids. I better take care of his integration myself. With business well in the house, it was alright for me to spend some time on idealism. Okay, alright! Come on then, let's go. You're going to drive the SS? -Yes. Alright... -Thank you. See you, then. -Yeah... I have often wanted to drive Tarjei's Impala. But not to get any place. The point is simply to enjoy life. If there's something we Telemarkers really know, it's how to enjoy life. We never stress. We actually have time to drive where we want. The point is not to get somewhere, when you're not going anyway. No, the point is to sit in a pristine vintage car, and glide without resistance through the landscape. It was this Otto had not understood. But maybe he'll get it, if I give him a little bit of a demonstration. We have to watch it, so we don't drive this wagon completely dead. Not possible to crawl with this thing, you know. Afraid? You're totally nuts! Watch out! Yes... with that demonstration I made time pass, but not Otto relax. Doesn't he like a bit of speed and excitement? Didn't Otto dare to lose control? Now, he probably thought he'd get it back when he got behind the wheel... but it's not that easy. I hate this lollypop wagon. I hate Am-car clubs and the whole package, with milkmaids and mutton and cabbage and fiddles and... The problem wasn't that Otto hated mutton and cabbage, fiddles and everything that has to do with Telemark. The problem was that he took it for granted that it had to be that way. It's better to give him mutton stew and fiddle. Better than going to Dalen with tourist milkmaids in tow. I'll rather drive him to Aslak at Vesaas. Aslak is a country rocker and village punker. Not even Otto could hate Aslak. Nice car, man! Jeez... It's an Impala? Osmund, uh, you must tell Otto about your car! Nah... well it was grandfather who brought it home back then. You see, I was over there on a trip and I got so fond of this car, I just bought it and brought it with me. Hadn't they shot a man in it, too? -Yes, right, this was a detective's car. Now you must come and have dinner! The mutton and cabbage is getting cold. No, it's time to set certain limits. To eat sheep corpse is something I definitely won't do. Now you must dig in. Tastes good. It's you who's a musician? -Yes. You've been to the party at M?sstrond then? The M?sstronders know how to party. -Yeah, I noticed. And how to play! Good fiddlers they have there. But I don't like organ. -As I thought. You should learn to play Harding fiddle as well! Yeah... Roots Research, it's Farida. -Hi, it's me. Hi, Anders. Is my car finished? ...the tires. ...V8... Yes, but, I need something that starts... You're crazy, Farida! Hey, you! Are you finished at work soon, or... Hey! You better come on home. It was bad enough that the engine was in an Opel. Are you coming? I'm hungry! Oh, damn, did you take Otto's engine? What am I to do with him now, then? That city guy is yours. You take care of him -But, Anders! Hel... Now you have to do something. Otto! Let it be, it must be done properly, you know! Hey, don't just stand there! Help now! Put it in, help put it in. Grab it now, then! My God... Lift it and bring it back to the trunk, come on. Is the car the only reason you're still in Telemark? Sure there's not something you haven't told me? What do you really know about your parents? -My parents? Hey stop! The Diplomat! What the hell is it you're driving at? Now I had to do something. I'd better try to distract him. Hello! If everything gets real and unreal at the same time, then everything will be possible. Because of that, one can find everything in Telemark. It only depends what one is looking for. They say one can even find oneself here. But I don't recommend that, because that's something one does on his own responsibility. When they searched the lake, they found the Impala with the sheep in the trunk. But Otto had totally disappeared. His V8, on the contrary, was definitely there. Even the sound of it often makes me think of Otto. It's perhaps that engine that will get me out of Telemark some day. Otto's Speedway Action Organ, yes... Until later, I can tell you that we'll have no trouble passing the time. It's hell not to have in Telemark. But it can also be the opposite.
