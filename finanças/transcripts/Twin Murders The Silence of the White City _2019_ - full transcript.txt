NETFLIX PRESENTS NEWBORNS 5-YEAR-OLD CHILDREN 10-YEAR-OLD CHILDREN 10-YEAR-OLD CHILDREN 15-YEAR-OLD TEENAGERS I've seen you running. Your name? Ismael. You? Blanca. A pleasure, Blanca. Detective! Is the Sleeper Killer back? Was it a double murder? Are you on the case, Detective Ayala? Give me a bone, we're friends, after all. You'll get a press release, like everyone else. Detective! Was it a double murder? They're glad to see you back on the job, Unai. Welcome home. Esti, the Sleeper Killer is back. That's why we need your smart brain. He hasn't struck for 20 years. I need records, photos, reports, everything. I emailed you everything. Try buying a 21st-century phone. Turn off the lights. Where your hunt ends and mine begins. Carlina. What do you see? He probably didn't know them. Doesn't matter who they are. It's what they represent. What do they represent? Rich kids. Gasoline. Tweezers. Shit! He put the bees in their mouth. He gagged them. And doused them in gas. The smell infuriates them. What you see here, are internal sting marks. He injected their necks with... liquid Flunitrazepam, Rohypnol. He used the drug to capture them. Then he waited until they were fully conscious. To cram the bees down their throats. It was a very painful death. Eneko. Eneko. I don't care, Thursday, Friday, I need it back now! I can't talk right now. We won't find any prints. He's too meticulous. Just in case. Get me that file! The news exploded all over social media. Kids still aren't back from partying last night, and half Vitoria has reported them missing. Find her! I want you to meet the new Deputy Police Chief. She's in charge of the case. A few things changed around here while you were gone. - Deputy. - Chief. Alba Díaz de Salvatierra, meet Detective Unai López de Ayala. Deputy. Nice to meet you. We had an innocent man in jail for 20 years? Either that, or he's got a partner outside. This murder is a copy of the ones before. The victims' placement is exactly the same. They're five years older with each new crime. Now, after 20 years, this numerical pattern... repeats itself. It's there, in the reports. Tasio Ortiz de Zarate wrote bestsellers in prison. He also has online presence... with over 500,000 followers. A killer with a fan club. Funny thing, he has no Internet access. It's practically a cult. Some have tattoos and sign with a carlina. A sun symbol, it wards off evil spirits. THE WHEEL TURNS AGAIN. STOP IT IF YOU DARE, #KRAKEN. What about the victims? Sure. Enara Fernández de Betoño, daughter to a well-known optician, and Alejandro Pérez de Arrilucea, son of an industrial family. Both 20 years old. Their families say they didn't know each other. They were individually selected. Upper class, well-known last names in Álava... I'm afraid he's at it again. - We should warn the city. - No. We must absolutely avoid alarming the people. It's that clear? So we'll wait to have two more victims? How many killers do you know with such a long cool-off period? It's probably a copycat. - Great, let's get to work. Esti? - Yeah. Detective! Do you remember me? Mario Santos. The newspaper director got me an interview with Tasio. Mario, please be discrete about us being here. Of course. Count on me. Good luck. He barely talked to me. I don't want an audience, Kraken. The detective is 100% trustworthy. I don't like threesomes. I won't talk until she leaves. - What did you tell her? - That you're a fucking misogynist. How did you know they call me Kraken? I came to offer you a gentleman's deal. In a few weeks, I get out on leave. If I help you catch the killer, people will accept me again. Don't think you're innocent. Can't you see, it's written on my face? Tell me about that tattoo. You think one of my followers is continuing with the murders? It would be pretty twisted... I didn't say they were following your orders. Every writer thinks they're a bit God-like. Some psychopaths do, too. Have you heard of the Werther Effect? When Goethe wrote The Sorrows of Young Werther, some of his readers decided to commit suicide the same way as the character in the novel. Fiction and reality are twins. They feed off each other. There are awful murders in all of them. Often from the killer's perspective. You know what I mean? If I could convince people to kill for me, I wouldn't have waited so long. What's going to happen? You know. Enlighten me. The Old Cathedral murder marked the 12th century. At this point, the scenes were the emblems of our history, beginning in the Middle Ages. The Anda House, the old Jewish quarter, the guild streets, maybe the Cordón House. You want a deal? Explain how you know I'm Kraken. You think I'm a dumbass? A bit, if you've been locked up 20 years and you're innocent, don't you think? So? Too impulsive. The station called. The victim's boyfriend is accusing her father of murder, and the man still hasn't reported her missing. Let's go see. Hello? Why are you in my house? Ertzaintza. We'd like to ask a few questions about your daughter. My collection of vertebrate eyes. Sorry. Could you tell us where her room was? Was this it? She doesn't need it now. MURDERS IN ÁLAVA I'm... Moving my collection in here. Do you have children? No. Don't have any. You don't care about catching the killer? Honestly, right now I just have a... Room... That I'd love to redecorate. Sorry, I need you to come with us to the station. José Ramón Fernández de Betoño. Where were you yesterday, July 24th, 2019? Is it true your daughter was moving in with your ex-wife? It's not him. But he got rid of all traces of his daughter hours after her death. Who does that? It might be denial. The first stage of grief. I saw your psychology report. No need to worry. I hope not, Detective. It's not very professional to get carried away by a hunch. Have a nice weekend. I brought the cakes. But you have to show me the test results. Oh. I'll need to try at least a few. Won't I? A few, yeah. I don't know why they don't sting you. Now you can rot. Will it work? Stop. Don't touch it. THE KILLER SPEAKS Today, on this Telluric special, we'll talk about the Sleeper Crimes. The double serial crimes that have rattled Álava. UPPER CLASS. MURDER WEAPON: YEW. The murders represent Álava's chronology. The Sorceress' Hut dolmen, 5,000 years ago. The victims were newborns. Then, in La Hoya, a Celtiberian town, 1200 BC, a pair of children were found, aged five. Later, in the Salado Valley, 1st century BC, 10-year-olds. The medieval wall, 11th century. 15-year-old kids. The gang called me. They want to do something for your birthday. I'm busy with work. I saw you're on the Sleeper case. Didn't you catch a guy yesterday? He's just a suspect. Unai, hiding under tons of work won't bring Paula back. You finished? Don't be mad. Since I got better, your brother worries more about you. More so now, with everyone wanting to know Kraken's identity. Cordón House. An interesting choice. A Jewish man's house, a forced to convert. - Did you go through the tiny entryway? - Yes. He had it built so small to force the old Christians to bow down before him. Does the profile match? Why did he use yew poison in the first crimes? He doesn't anymore? I won't share that info with you. I thought we had a deal. Yew trees are our ancient cathedrals. Our ancestors sat around them to hold rituals over 4,000 years ago. Imagine, one same yew tree has seen Celts, Romans, Christians, and the idiots of today. Very archaeological. Just what the judge said. At the trial, they played an early show I shot before the deaths. I explained, in detail, how to kill with a few boiled yew leaves. What a coincidence, huh? It wasn't coincidence. The killer wanted to frame me from the get-go. A new murder weapon might mean a new innocent will be framed. You've got to admit he's classy. Here. The list you asked for. Thoughts on your brother getting out? My twin. I turned him in. How do you think he took it? Did he match the profile? Not at first, but when they found the yew leaves, hidden in his apartment, I gave up. Did he know the victim? They were ritual killings, no more to it. It looked like there was semen on the body, we needed the autopsy report's confirmation. And that report... Went missing. They slept together. Tasio was an adult, she was 15. I got rid of the reports to tone down the story. It was scandalous enough that I had a killer twin, don't you think? 15 names? No one has 15 close friends. We'll start with the last ones on the list. Those'd have thought about him much more. The first will only say good things. We need to know the relationship with his mother. His mother? There were family photos, but not of her. Why Ismael? Boss... - Why Blanca? - It comes from Alba. But it's not Alba. Ismael isn't Unai, either. Why Kraken? Your prison visits make sense for the investigation, but it's no good for you that Tasio knows your teenage nickname. Why didn't you tell me? I am less than thrilled about you doing things on your own. You know I could open up a disciplinary inquiry? But you won't, will you? Nothing, not a trace, like the other. You're too exposed, Unai. I know. You know what this means? Yes, it's someone close. They know where you live, your car... What's this? You're the profiler. - Hi, Martina. - Glad you've made up your mind. I still haven't. Come the fuck on, Unai. You get it, right? Last year, we were here celebrating. All of us. I know. Come on, they're your friends. They won't bite. You obviously haven't known them long. Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday, dear Unai Happy birthday to you Thank you. - To Kraken! - To Kraken! Give me a glass. Is it true, about the hooves? What hooves? The male goat hooves. I heard there was a pentagram on the floor at the Cordón House. You know I can't say anything. We're working on it. We all went through this 20 years ago. We can't be afraid, that's what the killer wants. OK? OK, a toast! To Kraken! You sure he's Kraken? You didn't post them online, right? Obviously not. We had an arrangement, Mr. Santos. But I think the exclusive... should be more valuable. Did you think the investigation could be affected if Kraken's identity is revealed? Imagine all Vitoria on your back, the pressure you'd have to face. It would be hard for him to focus on the case, don't you think? - Not my problem. - Of course not. You said you were 30, but you look much younger. I never said I was 30... You can yell all you want. It's sound-proofed. Hey, hey! Help, help! Oh! And that is your problem. THE DETECTIVE'S CURSE: THE SOLUTION'S UNDER YOUR NOSE, BUT YOU CAN'T SEE IT. CAREFUL, #KRAKEN, THE KILLER IS VAIN. YOU MUST'VE ALREADY MET HIM. The killer has gone back to the numerical pattern with the new crimes. 20 years... 25 years... 30? 35? 40...? How far is he willing to go? How is he related to Tasio? What's he trying to say through the crimes? The killer knows about beekeeping, botany, history, anatomy... - This isn't from the machine. - Thank you. He's probably well-integrated in society. KRAKEN'S IDENTITY REVEALED In good physical shape. Maybe with a family life. Hi, honey! Right on time! Your 20 Euros back. - Thank you. - Thanks. Bye! - Hi, how are you? - Hi, cream cakes, please. It's you, right? Are you Kraken? - How much do I owe you? - Look. They're all 30. They're family, friends... They're real people. People I care about. Please, just take it with you! What, you don't care about us? It's Kraken! It's Kraken! Thank you. I got ahead on the list while you were with your fans. I spoke with Aitana, his ex. What relationship did they have with their mother? They loved her. When she got cancer, they doted on her. That's her. After the burial... BLANCA DÍAZ DE ANTOÑANA, YOUR SONS TASIO AND IGNACIO, IN LOVING MEMORY ...something happened. Everyone had gone. Then this guy came. He went up to the twins... I don't know what he said. But their reaction was intense. It's just my intuition, but... There was something in her eyes when she spoke of Ignacio and Tasio. You know how my Dad was. I know that look. I know that look, because I see it in the mirror. When did you start running? After I got pregnant. I wanted to get back in shape. That's commendable. What's commendable? I bet he keeps you up at night. How old's the baby? I lost it. I'm sorry. That's why you requested the transfer from France. Well, that. And my husband insisted. When I got pregnant. What about you? What's your story? You read the reports, right? I know your wife was pregnant when she died. In a car accident. It was no accident. Bye! - What does the press say? - Nothing. Sergio, no. Sergio! Sergio. Sergio, no! Sergio! No, Sergio! Sergio! Sergio, no! TELLURIC BEYOND HISTORY UFOs. Strange lights. Reality and fiction come together in Ochate's myth. In today's program, we'll see we need no other-wordly beings for this town to be... telluric. A town abandoned to fate... uninhabited since the mid-19th century. Amongst the church ruins of Ochate, Burgondo and San Vicentejo, we find a perfect isosceles triangle. A design both clear and mysterious... that must have been planned out beforehand. The San Vicentejo hermitage is a small Romanesque wonder where experts and onlookers say there are sightings and activities out-of-place in the land of the living. CRIME ZERO Quarry workers were hired to build a hermitage that taught the Genesis. They used the job to experiment and tell the old tale from their own perspective. These frescos show how Adam and Eve aged. From a baby-faced Adam... to a bearded man. Carlina. Sunflowers. Definitely sunflowers. They represent the Garden of Eden that surrounds the couple before they were banished. What about the bee? A psychopomp. A messenger between us and the land of the dead. But also the living image of the human soul. Arduousness, teamwork. And this is the story's climax. When they decide to eat from the Tree of Knowledge. For some, an apple tree. For others, a fig tree. But I see it as a yew. A tree... where it's all poisonous, except for the fruit. What if I told you that the first humans disobeyed an authoritarian God who denied them knowledge... for fear they would become his equals? That's what these walls say? Look, the first couple's faces. No sign of repentance. They know they did the right thing. They have each other. While God no matter how powerful... is alone. The story has always been told from the top. But here, it's told from the bottom. Is there anyone else who would know about this hermitage? Alive? One of the workmen might know something. They were all from Izarra. Alba. It's me. I have to see you. It's important. Hi! Hi, Josemari! Hello! Sorry I'm late. I thought I'd miss it. Yeah, Mario. Living life on the edge. As always. SEE YOU TONIGHT AT LIMBO. ENEKO The first crimes in this series are too perfect. We're missing something. Something not so thought-out. His first brushstrokes, crime zero. You think we could find something in Izarra? Or nearby. We can't waste precious time looking over files, Unai. It's not about wasting time. We need to know why to find out the who. We have to stop him. He will kill again. The next pair will be 30. We can't let him go now. As your boss, your obsession is beneficial. But not as Blanca. I don't like it. You think you could have stopped the crimes, huh? Sergio. His name was Sergio. - Who? - The guy who killed my wife and kid. He was named Sergio. He was a friend in our gang. Didn't shed a tear when his wife died. Right under my nose, but I couldn't see it. It was no accident, no suicide that randomly killed three people. It was murder. And I couldn't see it. I love it. You should see it from above. I know a place. Come on. You can watch it all away from the people. - Shit! - Let's go. Follow him! I'll go down and cut him off. Move this, guys. Let's go. Let me go. What the fuck are you doing? So what, the two lovebirds come together? Go before someone sees you like this. You don't fool me. You two are disgusting. I was at the newsroom. You can imagine the chaos after the two new bodies. How are you doing? I'm a little lost. I only wish I could help. Are you OK? A KILLER'S MOTIVATION IS ALWAYS PERSONAL #KRAKEN. I trust your intuition, but we're wasting time. There must be something. How can you cover up a crime? An accident? A fire? Lopidana Farmhouse, Izarra. Hello? Yes, sir. Yeah. I've been informed. No, that's not necessary. I'll take care of it. Neither you nor your brother need to worry ever again. My apologies, to you and your twin. Fighting with rich kids won't make you one of them! - Dad! - I'm not your Dad, you bastard! Venancio! Stop, you'll kill him! What if he's right? It all started when the lady visited. He's brain's soft from reading, and yours is, too! We could ask them for money. Regina! The lady's dead. I don't want to end up like Doctor Urbina. A cripple! You're going to work tomorrow. To fix roofs, with Estrellau. An awful fire. They all died: father, mother, two children... Only the red-haired kid survived. The kid got lucky. Remember his name? No. We have to stop seeing each other. My husband knows. Knows what? Nothing happened. Right. Should we go up? Fine. Wait. LUTXO ARTXANKO DIARIO ALAVÉS Thanks. You look beautiful, sweetheart. You haven't called me that for a while. Maybe it's been too long. Maybe yes. Did you know that inside the pyramids, they found honey pots that are still edible? It's a preservative... with plenty of therapeutic properties. So it's no surprise that since ancient times... Some people don't know how to dress properly for these events. Alexander the Great's body was preserved in honey. Obviously, after testing... its other virtues. It's also one of the most powerful aphrodisiacs. Who wants to try? No one has a date today? Ignacio, Europa Press. Was a mistake to arrest your brother for the Sleeper killings? No comment. Did you know Lídia García de la Vicuña, the fifteen-year-old victim? At Diario Alavés, we received images that could turn the case on its head. I'll send two patrol cars to his house. Waste of time. He won't go there. Ignacio Ortiz de Zárate has gone missing just two days before his brother Tasio receives his first prison leave. Many women have joined the suit against the brothers. All victims of the sexual exchange the Ortiz de Zárate brothers allegedly practiced. ÁLAVA PENITENTIARY CENTER She was mature for her age, you don't get it. Tell that to the judge. You think you were born entitled to whatever you want? You better than me now, farmer boy? You don't have a fucking clue what's happening. Before, following you was subversive. Now it's just repugnant. Ignacio screwed her first, right? Or did you? He liked her and just couldn't bear it. You don't get it. Since our mother's womb, we've always been two bodies, but one person. The arrest warrant came from your other half. You ever think it may have been revenge? Your brother was a cop, he could doctor evidence, reports... Ignacio never would have had the guts to kill her. He never visited in 20 years, and you still defend him? I was very sorry to hear about your wife, Kraken. I get you want a culprit, but she's dead. - Know why I chose you? - You didn't choose me! I needed to see the paths I had yet to travel. You're showing me. What the hell are you talking about? It's one of my followers. I don't have fond memories of him. He's called "Grass" on Twitter. We have the same tattoo. You know him. You know him well. Eneko! Eneko! Eneko! What do you want, man? Looking for my sister? I was talking to an old friend of yours. Cool. What'd he have to say? Zugarramurdi, remember? That concoction you gave him? Almost fucked him up for life. Tasio. Tasio was always a wimp. He was out of it. Like he'd been drugged with Rohypnol. He had a bad trip 20 years ago. So what? You know, Unai? Tasio never got how important our old customs were. Stop! You turned your sister into a junkie! Where there when our Dad beat us up? You asshole. Today is the last day of the festival. There will be checkpoints at all exits and entries to Dato street. The files have lists of the places where the latest bodies were. Our experts agree that Arca Square could be the next location. So I want you all on alert. OK? Our main suspect is a male, 35 years old, red hair, and a tattoo on the back of the neck. Any questions? Great. Because I want to catch that asshole! Man your stations, thank you. - Alba. - What do you want? Another screw to let off steam? Tell me, would you let me into your house? He touched my ass! Esti, can you tell me what one of our vans is doing in that alley? It shouldn't be there. Let's go! Esti, Esti. Esti. Esti, Esti, Esti. No, no! No! No! Unai. What's going on? Where's Martina? Where is Martina? I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Unai. Truly. He's doing it. He's still playing with us. You don't say. You and Estíbaliz were too emotionally involved. Fuck off, Alba! This is what he wanted. We're getting closer and closer. Closer to what? A few hours ago, your main suspect became the new victim. Ignacio? My name is Antonio Garrido-Stoker. I'm his lawyer. Come in. Where is Ignacio? Ignacio came to us a few days ago. After a slanderous publication. My client... voluntarily agreed to surveillance 24 hours a day. What I'm trying to say is... we can reliably prove my client can't be guilty of... the unfortunate murders last night. Every single second, my client was under surveillance. Asshole. I'm just staying one step ahead, Detective Gauna. I'm 20 years ahead of you in this game. Tell me about her. My client won't answer that. The deceased's parents have filed no report, perhaps because these images prove absolutely nothing. They prove you knew her. Was that it, Ignacio? Find out your teenage brother and girlfriend betrayed you? That's why you got him arrested? I'm sorry about your brother, Detective. Son of a bitch! Let go of me! I'll need your badges and service weapons, Detectives. WHY? Bees always return to the nest. It's a miracle it's still alive. If I can help... I'm off the case, Grandpa. I've got nothing. Quit whinging, keep going! The White Virgin. Rumor had it in Vitoria... Town gossip, you know. Said she married her husband... while pregnant by another. What did he say for the twins to beat him up? I don't know or care. They're so proud of being Ortiz de Zárate. - Unai. - What if they aren't? - We're off the case, Unai. - You're pissed we're off it, too. What do you want? To break the law? He's not going to stop. Help me catch him. You think he's after you? Let's go to where it all began. Thanks for giving me a discrete exit. Thanks for giving me your first interview after release. Whenever you want. When we were little, we always switched clothes. Pretended to be the other. But Mom always caught us. Took us a while to discover how she did it, remember? - I always sat in the left chair. - And I sat in the right. Some things never change, twin brother. It's funny, hearing you speak of your childhood, about your mother... I feel kind of... Jealous! Tell me about the cemetery incident. Which one? You want to loosen our tongues, Mario? The day you buried your mother. You beat up a guy. Remember? I think he had red hair. How the fuck do you know that? Because certain things you never forget. Brothers. I want to see my children! Open the door! I want to see my children! Open the damn door! Open the door! Open the door! I want to see my children! My son! We adopted them out. A couple from Izarra that sold honey at fairs. It wasn't the first time this had happened at Arana Clinic. They named him... Nancho. Nancho... Lopidana! It all fits. The Lopidanas adopted him. They couldn't have kids, but then, a miracle. She got pregnant. Nancho went from spoiled kid to Cinderella in an instant. Banished from Eden. Detective Ayala? - What's up? - We just got the forensic report. Nancho Lopidana died in a fire at a pension in Pamplona. No one claimed the body. He fell asleep reading. An old lamp sparked, and he burned to death. I always told Dad to change those lamps! He finally did. Too late, but he did it. Here, come with me. This is when he arrived. He was very quiet. Who's that? That was his roommate. They both studied journalism. They stuck together like glue. I even got them mixed up. - Do you remember his name? - Yeah. Mario. Mario Santos. It's going to get cold. I can't stop thinking about this nightmare. Any interesting leads? Several. But they go nowhere. Everyone's on edge. I see... No surprise. I'll get it. - Hello? - Alba! - Alba... - Never call me at home again. Alba, listen. If you're with Mario, find an excuse and leave now. - What the hell do you mean? - Alba. It's him! Go to hell. Remember you're off the case. Bye. Alba, you need to leave now! Alba... Mario? Alba! Fuck. Mario? Mario! Mario! I was about to quit. For you. For our child. You don't know how close I was to being me again. You can't even imagine. Alba! Alba! There's no one! What should we do? Back to the beginning. I had a perfect partner for you. Your age, related to the twins. Perfect! Not everyone can appreciate perfection. But they can respect it. Obviously, not you. Don't make that face. You two made me do this. It didn't have to be this way. This isn't... Yet in some way, you are the best couple I've united. Bees are fascinating. Most people think the queen rules over the workers, but that's not entirely true, because... at first, the queen's just larva, no different from the rest. The workers decide to make her their queen. I'm but a knife, my love. I was forged by others. The knife isn't guilty for what it cuts. What do you want? A proper execution? Is that what you want?
