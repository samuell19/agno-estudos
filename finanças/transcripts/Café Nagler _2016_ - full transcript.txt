You place a napkin on the tray it's very important. The coffee... oh, it's heavy. The milk... Sugar Is it very heavy? -No, it's okay. No! No, no... you must always place it this way So one can always lift it from here, you see? -Oh... Everything is planned for comfort One? Place the teaspoon facing the other side Good, alright. Ah... that's good. You know what? You didn't bring dishes for the cake And that's not right This is impossible Every visit to my grandmother, Naomi, begins with an important, elaborate ceremony. The highlight of this ceremony arrives when the dishes and stories of Cafe Nagler come out, reminding me that we come from a distinguished Berliner lineage. This plate has a drawing of Cafe Nagler Can you see? This is the building! These are the dishes my grandmother brought from Germany This is the silverware from the cafe With N for Nagler They brought it all with them That's it. I'm glad it didn't turn black Yes, it's surprising I was afraid it will turn black here from the humidity The legendary Cafe Nagler - the hottest, most beautiful, and wildest Cafe in Berlin of the 1920s. Here, there you have it Cafe Nagler at Moritzplatz, Berlin. Cafe Nagler was located in the fabulous Moritzplatz. This is the cafe's interior look at that chandelier! Here! This is the ground floor, where people would have a beer and hang out the artists would sing and play this wasn't the grand restaurant and here they would walk up to the grand restaurant Everybody sat there - from Einstein to Kafka, having a gugelhupf for breakfast and some Absynth at night. This is another part of the cafe Oh! And this is their private lives - this is my grandfather Rosa and Ignatz Nagler, Naomi's grandparents, opened the Cafe in 1908 and ran it for 17 tumultuous years in Berlin's history. In 1925, they closed their Cafe, moved to Palestine, and began longing. Cafe Nagler was an establishment from which the family grew on Brecht certainly sat there, and his crowd, the actors, the writers, etc. So, for me Cafe Nagler was always very important it was very much alive for me all the dishes I grew up with even, even our blankets not to mention in our living room we had a billiard table brought from Cafe Nagler I used to play billiard from the day i could reach the table not snooker! Billiard, real billiard! My grandmother, who grew up engulfed in history, became a documentary filmmaker and made films for over forty years. My whole life I received postcards from her filming expeditions around the world - from a series about the Alhambra Decree to a journey following the Kingdom of Khazaria. I used to brag that my grandmother is the interviewer behind the camera in the epic series "Pillar of Fire". I always wondered why Naomi, between all the documentaries she's made, never made a film about the great Cafe Nagler. Look, when I worked in television making films I wasn't comfortable shoving my family and the story of the Naglers, of Cafe Nagler in my daily work. What, Kaplansky is going to make a film about her grandparent? It wouldn't work... Back then, you couldn't, I didn't You were afraid you would seem to be bragging? Yes, that I'm pushy, I'm showing off why am I pushing myself in? It's very sad, because people's identity gets lost this way a part of the family's history is lost. Maybe it's not important, to me it seems important. In her polite, Yekke manner, my grandmother made it crystal clear that she's waiting for me to make a film about Cafe Nagler. Armed with the motivation of five generations of longing, I packed Cafe Nagler's precious documents and came to Berlin. It took me a while to realize that the place where Cafe Nagler used to stand is actually this deserted grove. But even if I don't have doors to knock on or neighbors to chat with, the Berliners are passionate about their city's history. I was certain that between the ancient files that are strictly kept here the story of Cafe Nagler is waiting for me. So I got to know all the celebrities of Kreuzberg's past, read anonymous love letters dating back a hundred years and learned all I could about the promiscuous nightlife of the 1920s. At the newspaper archive, after spending days with past news, suddenly a sale in Westens Department Store in 1922 started to sound appealing. The horse Frederick Schmidt came in 2nd place, Sale on statues from the Elizabethan era, 3 skirts for 2 thousand marks, until 20 pm, don't be late, Demonstration over the wages of textile workers, Lost! A black puppy, Coffee and strudel for 5 hundred marks, Second grade bolts made in Poland, Women Only - A subscription to the swimming pool, Wanted! A nanny for 3 polite children, This Sunday the whole family visits the fair at- September 6th, 1920: Last night, at Cafe Nagler in Moritzplatz, Yohan Kaminski, a 38 year old clerk, jumped up after a heated argument and fired his gun. The lady with him, Frida Schwartz, fell to the floor. Then, Kaminski aimed the gun at his head and fired. I rushed to the police archive to learn more about these juicy events. At the police archives they truly found my story exciting, but it turns out they don't keep 90 year old reports. At the state film archives they dusted dozens of ancient newsreels for me. I saw footage of Berlin from the early days of cinema, and Berlin, a burgeoning film capital, was thoroughly documented. I was hoping to catch a few frames of Cafe Nagler, or even Moritzplatz on one of the reels. Finally, there was a moment where I was certain I had found Cafe Nagler, flickering on the screen, glamorous and merry... Until the caption appeared - "Cafe Kranzler, 1922" The next day that caption continues to haunt me. Here you can see the sign "Kranzler" A boutique and at the top the Cafe Kranzler. Cafe Kranzler, like Cafe Nagler was one of a few legendary cafes in 1920s Berlin and Fred Riedel knows everything about those hot locations. The Romanisches Cafe was that. At the corner over there was Cafe of the West around 1900. On the left side you can see the Cafe Bauer. I politely waited till we reached Cafe Nagler and got drowned in a list of cafes and their famous patrons. Berthold Brecht, Otto Dix, Alfred Doblin, Gottfried Benn ,George Gross... When I saw that Herr Riedel was preparing to finish, I insisted that we drive to Moritzplatz. I don't know anything about Cafe Adler I only know that you have beautiful eyes. Nomichke? Yes! -What's up? How are you? -Good... Are you in the middle... -How's it going? It's going well -How's it going, Morzaleh? It's going well -What? It's going very well, where are you? I'm in bed, I'm a bit dizzy today Oh! What do you feel? Everything's fine! No, no! are you filming a lot? Yes, loads. What's wrong? Since when are you not feeling well? Today, only today, my car broke down so I went to the garage. -Yes. when I returned home I felt more wobbly than usual. Do dad and Ruti know you were weak? What? -That you are a bit weak today, do they know? No, no, no, no, no... thank you very much for calling it's awfully nice of you. I want to Good, it makes me very happy Alright, Nomichke, so, kisses... Goodbye sweetheart, bye, Morzaleh. -Bye. Hello. -Hello. Hello, my name is Mor, I come from Israel. -Yeah? And my fam... Hello. Hello. -Hello. My family used to live here a long time ago. They lived here? -Yeah, in this apartment, and I wonder if it would be okay, if I could come in? Yes, come in. -Yeah? Okay. Thank you! Just to have a look. You are welcome to enter. Would you like to look around? Yeah, I'd love to see. Okay. Here's the kitchen. -Yeah. The kitchen was closed here. This was the toilet, which now is our guests' toilet. This is the original ceiling? Yes, yes with ornament ceiling. Thank you. It's lovely. -Sugar? We have been living in this apartment for over 50 years. Before that a woman used to lived here for 50 years. Mrs. Wessels, she was half Jewish and the only souvenir stands over there - the Menorah. We inherited it. It stood in the corner on the bookshelf before, too. My family, who used to live here, are called Nagler. So maybe this woman who died in this apartment, maybe she was a Nagler also? I don't know. You are sure that they lived here from 1905, the same family? Yes, always the same family    - Wessels. Wessels and Bants. Wessels and Bants. -Yes, Bants, too. Mrs. Bants and Mr. wessels. They lived here. Okay... This is 34 Zoolanderstrasse? No, that is next to us. This is 34a. It is next to us, after the building. Your Coffee? It turns out that like many other buildings, like the building of Cafe Nagler, the house where the Naglers lived was bombed during the war and never rebuilt. And this dump was their home. Great. So no cafe and no house. Yes. Nomichke? Hi, how are you? It's going great... great... really. Yes, yes, we're getting a lot of... materials... We're filming all the time. Yes, we're... Actually we're near Moritzplatz now. Yes, yes, you're right Okay, Okay, kisses, thanks, me too alright, bye. Shit... Facing all this void I wanted to see some documents, dates, photos. Something real, something tangible. This is a letter where they ask the permission to construct a wall next to the building, because during the night in the cafe there was a lot of noise and the neighbors were disturbed by this noise because the cafe was open really until the early morning. So this is the last evidence of the building, basically. Yes, so they prolonged it until 1946, but it must have been bombed before, between 1942 to 1946... Because there's nothing... Yes, nothing left of the building, there's nothing to be done. There's nothing to be done. I have to admit, I've never heard of Cafe Nagler before. Can you think of an explanation for this? 'Cause you've seen the photos and it looks like a big, impressive place. Yeah, but I mean... First and foremost, if you think about the 1920s and the Golden '20s, it's not the Moritzplatz, it's the Kurfurstendamm, that's where all the new culture, the new cafe culture, the intellectuals meet and drink, where the new drinks come in, the new tourists come in, the new drugs come in, and the Golden '20s happened, and it's not... Moritzplatz. I returned to my room to find and email From Dr. Kreutzmuller. "Dear Mor, "When we met yesterday I couldn't bring myself to discourage you in front of the camera. "However, I do feel that I have to be frank with you - "from what information I could gather, "it appears that Cafe Nagler was a nice, beautiful neighborhood cafe, "but no more than that. "I regret to have to tell you this, "but I believe it is the historical truth." I started thinking about flying home, but at the last minute I received information that might salvage the situation - someone from the Friends of Kreuzberg Association managed to locate an elderly man from the neighborhood who spent much of his childhood in Cafe Nagler. He remembers Cafe Nagler. -You're kidding. And his father even used to play the piano there at nights. You don't say. -Yes. He remembers your grandparents. -You're kidding. Do you mind if I come? Just for that, no more. I won't bother you. Just for half a day. I'm dying to meet that man, that's all. I was worried about Naomi, the veteran documentarist's arrival that she'd realize I had virtually nothing on the cafe. But when I sat next to her I realized I got a chance to see my grandmother as she used to be, in the role of the interviewer. Do you have any memories, stories about the people in Cafe Nagler? It was a real meeting point for everyone, people who knew each other because they were a bit more educated. Authors, actors, musicians... My father sometimes played a sitar, and people danced... Do you have any specific memories of Ignatz Nagler, or Rosa Nagler, my grandfather and grandmother? Of the grandfather I don't, but of the grandmother - I do, I don't remember the grandfather. What memory do you have of my grandmother? She was always lovely to the children. Always, very nice. She used to pick me up, give me pralines, and say: Go on, continue fooling around. This is how it was... I only know that my entire family loved going there. What will we do tomorrow? Yes, we'll go to Nagler! To the garden? Or the cafe? It's all good! My father played the piano there often. I know one song, "In Rlcksdorf there is music... " Yes, that too. I was born in 1928 in Binyamina, but I know these songs. Nomichke gave me a strong embrace, thrilled by the successful interview, and returned to Israel. But then I got another phone call from that member of the Kreuzberg Association. He asked me to meet him and Herr Handschke urgently. He said there is a problem. But before he started talking, I couldn't resist squeezing in another question... We heard stories that... that the neighbors complained that at night there was terrible noise. Everybody were drunk, and they used to shout... The police came by often! Or, sometimes... Perhaps one more thing Cafe Nagler existed in Berlin between 1908 and 1925 And Mr. Hendschke was born in 1925. ...when he sometimes says, for example that he used to go with his father to Cafe Nagler, it's actually not possible. In 1925 he was maybe one year old. But we understand that his memories always have some boundaries, they're always somewhere between subjective truth and fiction and sometimes they are how he would have liked to remember things. So I'm asking you to understand it's not certain that this is all real. But what is real anyway? We all have our own realities. I wish for everyone to live to be 88 like me! and then 20 more years! I will live to be a hundred yet! We shall meet! Spasiba! Merci! Nomichke, I'm in the middle of something. I'll call you later. Nobody has ever heard of Cafe Nagler And we see that it's a big place -Yeah. and beautiful, and it existed for a long time and nobody's heard of it. It is, especially in Kreuzberg, Kreuzberg used to be, always used to be an immigrant quarter and people tend to arrive here but not to stay. The immigrants are not maintaining traditions and they don't remember what was in this quarter two generations or three generations before. They remember what was in Turkey or what was in Russia or what was in Poland or wherever they came from. You could say... Could you say that Cafe Nagler was maybe the biggest or most... maybe the biggest cafe that you know of owned by Jewish immigrants in those years? Yes. -Could you say that? From all that I learned from you and your family's story about Cafe Nagler I have to admit that I think Cafe Nagler is really the biggest cafe and restaurant which was run by Jewish immigrants at that time. How many records do you have? I didn't count them, but I'm afraid it's about 6,000. I understand you've never heard of Cafe Nagler. Unfortunately, not. So I thought this is very exciting to find out about something you really don't know so much about. My grandmother always says that swing dance was created in Cafe Nagler. Not possible. Swing didn't exist. Okay, I see. Could it have just been invented then? No. No. The word "swing" did not exist at all till 1936. 12 years after Cafe Nagler, first time you heard in Germany the word "swing." It didn't exist. It was not invented. The word didn't exist. Would you be able to say that swing dance was invented in Cafe Nagler? Perhaps an earlier version? It's hard to do something... telling, this is the truth and in the end it's a lie, because this is what Neo-Nazis do all the time. They say Auschwitz is a lie, and we know it's not a lie. I can tell many stories and imagine many nice fairytales, but I don't want to lie. The legendary Cafe Nagler in Berlin, in Moritzplatz, one of the finest squares in the city 5 generations of Naglers in Israel who drank thousands of coffees from beautiful cups ate Clara Rosa Nagler's famous Gugelhupf and told stories that Berlin seem to have forgotten. All the way to Israel, I couldn't stop thinking of how I will walk into my grandmother's home and break her heart. Nomichke? -You're here! Hallelujah! I wasn't sure you'd make it. How are you? He's filming already... -Look at you! I put make up on You're wearing make up! It's impossible otherwise; do you know how it looks? Completely blue? -Very blue, down to here. Oh, there? It flowed from here all the way down There you have a bruise -There and here It's alright, nothing to it -But did you also hit your arm? No, that's another bruise. Another one? Dad will kill you! This is fun! What are your next plans? What, today? -No, in general In general... -Are you constantly working? Eh, we're getting more into... Yes? -High gear So what we found- What did she find? Where was that restaurant? I was caught between pieces of information I could no longer hide, and my difficulty telling Naomi about the true state of our film. And both of them don't exist anymore Wait... Both of them don't exist anymore? -Yes You slice each side in three... This way, Dad? And then cut them in half... and again Cakes were only Linzer-torte and Bienenstich, or other classic German cakes all Yekkes came to Israel but stayed in Berlin. Naomi feels that she's fulfilling herself through you. For her, the story of Cafe Nagler is huge. She's absolutely fulfilling herself through you, in every way I see it, I hear it. Really? -Certainly. Each time you visit it's a celebration and any mention of the film makes her sharp and alert she becomes thrilled, she's very happy about it, she feels accomplishment, it gives her closure. You're her successor She had some hopes that I would become a filmmaker but since I failed her, you, as my daughter, are the family's filmmaker and you're her natural successor. Wow, it's excellent! Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me! I'm working here! Here. Naomi, who apparently noticed that I returned with a heavy heart, took me on a tour of the Nagler home in Haifa, so I wouldn't forget where I came from. This is where I grew up this was our playground. Here. This was the garden... All this... -Wow. Belonged to my grandparents. This is the Naglers' home they brought the house with them from Berlin by ship. It was a replica of their hunting cabin in the Black Forest. It's really funny What? -Seeing how it changed But I think that if we follow this path we can see the house from behind And as we walked around the Nagler grounds, who's myths are crumbling around me it became even harder to tell her about my failed mission. Well, it's cold today It's cold, ha? -Yes. Run up there and see if there's, left of the stairs, the new stairs, there used to be a sign "Nagler Home". Morzaleh, it was here, in front of the stairs in front of these stairs where the flowers are. There is no sign. They took it down. Fine, never mind. They took it down, never mind. Never mind. My beloved niece, Mor. I heard from Naomi that you're gathering testimonies for your documentary about the shady Cafe Nagler. Well, your father mentioned that he's already been filmed, so why have I, who am always after the limelight wasn't invited to participate? Well, here's the real version of what actually went on in Cafe Nagler, as I've personally heard from my grandmother, Omama. Mor. -What? Why does a cheap man... Why does a cheap man watch a pornographic movie from the end to the beginning? -Why? He wants to see the prostitute give money back. Get it? -Yes. And then she said "look, we had a cafe in Berlin" What?! You had a cafe? Yes! A huge cafe! Three stories high! I said "oh, Omama, come on..." "No, Ranile, we had a huge cafe with a bar and restaurant downstairs and a grand family-restaurant on the second floor Wait, but you mentioned a third floor she said "yes, there was also a third floor" "What was on the third floor?" So she squirmed a bit, until she finally said "well, Ranushle, you're a grown boy now..." I was 16 already "up there we had smaller rooms, with sofas and small tables and couples used to go up there for privacy" I said "what couples? What is this? are you talking about prostitution?" and she said "no, no, it wasn't this kind of prostitution, no. But these were war-widows, or young, unemployed women, who needed money, or divorcees, and women abandoned by spouses, or mothers of small children who went out at night to earn some money and I said "what, young women would go up there?!" and she said "yes, they would and it was accepted." And I asked "but the family... your father knew?!" She said "my father owned the place! And my mother sat at the cash register, She knew very well, my mother sat at the register, she didn't trust anyone." Calling it a fact, based on an assumption and giving explanations based on assumptions, I think that's not right. The cafe was open to the early morning It isn't right -It's possible that during the day, while... One moment! In the morning, afternoon, evening, they served afternoon teas, and dinner it's possible that after 10-11 at night it became sleazier, more intimate more daring, fresh -Isn't it just "possible"? No, it's not just possible, it's what usually happens in places open until late at night -But you're assuming No, I'm not assuming You're certain that Cafe Nagler was like that? -I wasn't there Oh, you weren't there... -I'm certain that most cafes, if they could, if they had rooms at the third floor cafes that didn't have a second or third floor simply couldn't, but cafes that could, and were open until late, certainly did. Again, you're assuming and lecturing as a historian No, I'm telling what she told me -Why do you do this? Why? I thought it was a nice, fresh anecdote that shows our human side that we're not all square Yekkes who only serve coffee with cream and a strudel with some ice cream so there was a bit more mom, it's okay to be a bit more bohemian you're not the first bohemian in Israel there was your mother before you and her mother... We didn't invent the wheel. So what, I'm not that shocked about it and you shouldn't be- why are you shocked suddenly? I'm not shocked by it I'm shocked by your excitement about it and that you see it as an anecdote and you emphasize it I see the reality in Berlin during the early twenties Good -And I think your grandfather was very human I think this compassion was, like I tell you inherited by Sophie, and you got it from her. You both always accepted differences and were always liberal I'm afraid you're far more liberal then I am I've always been more conservative. You both accepted others and were far more forgiving towards differences that's why I think you actually inherited some of the legacy of Cafe Nagler perhaps it left more of a mark in you then you're willing to admit. That's my opinion, and if I've offended you, I apologize if I said anything that offended you, I'm terribly sorry -You didn't offend me Because the last thing I want is to upset my 86 year old mother You didn't offend me -But I thought that if we see it from a human perspective, we could laugh, It's okay to laugh at ourselves a bit -Certainly and at our heritage -Certainly -Okay. So be it. Nomichke, tell me... are you alright? -What? -Are you alright? I'm alright. -You're not angry? I'm fine. -You're not angry? No, of course not. Look, this is your film. You should do what you think is right. I think it went nice. - I'm not angry. Not at all. I'm not angry at you. You shouldn't be angry at anyone. That day I realized that memories are more precious than all the documents, dates, and historical facts, and it was becoming clear that I cannot return to my grandmother without a film about Cafe Nagler. But I've heard about it all my life and I can't disappoint my family and go back home and tell them: Your big and famous cafe wasn't so big and famous. So I'm... I'm creating a fictional documentary about the cafe. -Okay. So I'm kind of inviting you to join me in this creation of a film about the cafe. Okay. So what I'd like to ask you to do is to think of a personal story that you've heard in your family. -Okay. And the only thing I would ask you is to place this story in Cafe Nagler. But it has to be a true story. So now I have to think. What I've been told is that my great-grandmother, she was in love with a doctor. He was still a student and he kind of finished his studies very quick and then he had to travel somewhere, I don't know... Stop, stop for a moment. Okay, so what I've been told is that my great-grandmother she fell in love very strongly with this doctor-student, he was still very young, and at that time they made the students finish their studies very quick so they could send the boys to the war. And she loved this man totally and he left, and when he left he gave her a little thing around her arm that was from his hat. Okay, so she was wearing this all the time, and then one day she was sitting in this Cafe Nagler. She was sitting there and it fell off. It wasn't there anymore. She was sitting there having her coffee and it wasn't there. And a few days later she heard that he had fallen in the war. And she didn't go back to this cafe any more because she was too sad, it was a sad place for her to go. I can tell you my great family secret I solved when I was a teenager. My great-grandmother, when she was a young girl she should marry, but she wasn't sure if she loved him, if she wanted this life. And in Cafe Nagler she met this man, a young, handsome man, Polish and Jewish soldier, and she fell in love with him wildly. And she built up a secret love affair and one day she got pregnant and it was shortly before the soldier had to flee for obvious reasons so she married this other man very quickly, who still loved her, and he said: Okay, this will be my child, and that was my grandmother. I was always afraid my great-grandmother was so closed in that part because she felt guilt, but she felt heartbreak. It's a tragic story, I think, but nice. Would you be able to... imagine... how Cafe Nagler could have been? So this could have been probably the most modern dance piece to be played in Cafe Nagler in 1924. All the literature guys came to Cafe Nagler, of course. Alfred Dublin was sitting there every night on his way from his office home, he was living in the West. He had to change from the subway to the tramway just in front of Cafe Nagler. Of course he was having a little cocktail in Cafe Nagler. It's a beautiful fiction, it could have been like this. I realized Naomi would expect to hear from some important historian. I was skeptical that Dr. Kreutzmuller, a distinguished historian who works at the Wannsee House would be willing to participate, but I had to try... And now we are on Moritzplatz, the most important square in the town, that's the square where everything happened, and that's the square where, of course, The Cafe Nagler was, just right here opposite this wonderful cafe where we were just given this wonderful beer in order to have a toast, l'chaim, to Cafe Nagler. And of course this was the place... Yeah, it's a wasp. And I've been stung by one yesterday. Yeah, this here was the ground floor of Cafe Nagler where, so to speak, the boring people were, like, all the politicians and... and businesspeople from Ritterstrasse and all that, but then you go upstairs, into the trees, into the sky, that would be the first floor, that's where Rosa ruled, really, and Rosa had this air about her of letting people do what they wanted and being generous. "Here lived Clara Rosa and Ignatz Nagler, "Owners of the Famous Cafe Nagler." It was a very well-known family, they had a lot of guests. In recent years people often come and ask about the Nagler family whom we don't know and ask to see the apartment where they lived. Up there is a souvenir from the apartment, a Menorah, we said it's symbolic, we'll keep it, we'll leave it standing there. That's the story of the Naglers. My grandmother lived here in Berlin in 1922. When she was sixteen she wasn't allowed outside at night. One night she said she was going out for a school trip or something but she actually went with friends to Cafe Nagler One night my great uncle, her older brother joined their table but my grandmother didn't know that they came on a special evening... At midnight, they suddenly heard trumpets and saw fireworks and an Indian prince arrived, riding a white elephant. My grandmother thought: "Where did this elephant come from?! where did this prince come from?!" The prince rode on the elephant straight to my grandmother and her brother's table and extended his hand. My uncle stood up, because he was meeting the prince of India, climbed on top of the elephant, said goodbye, and he and the prince disappeared. From that day on my grandmother knew her brother's secret and whenever one of them needed the other's cover, they would say "we are going to Cafe Nagler" and my great-grandmother would say "yes, you may go, "but don't forget that you come from a good home!" And of course Otto Dix would come along and George Gross and all those people, thinking, "Hah, I want to go to Moritzplatz "just to get this vibe of Cafe Nagler." Wow. The air of freedom, the air of creativity. -Amazing. And the cheesecake, of course. -Of course. If what my grandmother told me is true, if the Cafe Nagler wouldn't be there, I wouldn't be there. My grandmother loved the movies and she used to work in a movie theater and that's where she met my grandfather because my grandfather was a saxophone player, he played the saxophone in a film orchestra. And there was one actress that she really, really loved and admired and one night they went to the Cafe Nagler and my grandfather was playing in the jazz band and my grandmother was dancing. In came this famous actress that she admired so much and she was so embarrassed, she was really struck at this moment, but it came so that this really famous actress and my grandmother went to a separe, a private room because on the top in Cafe Nagler there were the private rooms for special guests. She never saw this actress again after this one night. This actress went to America and went to work for Paramount. And then came the sound, sound came into the movies so that the talking pictures came. This one birthday, my grandmother, she was a little bit drunk and she said: You know what the real reason was, the real reason she didn't make it into the talking pictures? It was because her voice was too low. What, her voice was too low? She said: her voice was too low! It could be that I'm actually the grandson of this famous film actress who actually wasn't an actress but a man. This pursuit of Cafe Nagler, introduced me to others, who, like my family somehow live in the past. Like Dylan, who deejays 20s music and dreams of Nosferatu and expressionistic cinema from the period, or Erna, who dreams of the liberal days of the 20s, like her grandmother told her, when Berlin was a haven to gays and transgenders, and Vivian, who inherited from her grandmother her clairvoyance and talks about the attraction of the 1920s crowds to the supernatural and the subconscious. And I ask myself: What is it about this era that my family clung to all those years? The merry Weimar years, when being a German Jew... was a particularly high pedigree. My family left Berlin in 1925 and even if they missed it, they had no home to return to. So they lived in Palestine, Surrounded by their beloved dishes, Baked strudels and told stories. Place three of them Now here are the salads Ruti brought, you can bring them. Listen, Morzaleh, take out the Nagler serving spoons There are larger ones Larger ones? Here? -Yes. Look. Morzaleh, take out the plates. - Plates. Here... There are more plates, smaller ones. -The smaller ones? So why did you bring that? These ones and the smaller ones.
