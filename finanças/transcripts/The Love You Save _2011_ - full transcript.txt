Darling, you are so funny. You have to seemy new Jaguar. Yes, it's going to bemy "get around town" car. I just didn't want to putso many miles on my Bentley. No. you would love it! It's yellow... this sortof canary yellow. I'm sorry, darling. I'm going to have to cutour conversation short. My help wantsto ask me something. I just don't want to keepmy maid waiting. Okay, darling, I will talkto you soon. Ta-ta.bye. One of your bourgeois socialitefriends, miss benet? Please, I didn't even know that woman. It was the wrong number. I think she was trying to raisemoney or something. Consuela, do you think that that'show the girl scouts are selling cookiesthese days? You know, I don't know why thatyou just insist on always calling me "the maid." You know that i'ma domestic engineer. Engineer of what? Making cocktails? Don't you have some engineeringto do right now? Some work, consuela? Somewhere... in the kitchen? Siempre, siempre. What have I said? We only speak english here, consuela. Proper english. Like the proper fake accentthat you speak with? Or like thosefake eyelashes, or the fake fingernails, or the fake hair that you wear? I mean, is there anything realabout you? 'Cause, you don't... you know, i'm just asking. I'm going to overlookthat right now, consuela. How about this? What would you like for dinner tonight, miss Alexis benet? See? That was nice. That was very, very nice. Now, was that so hard, sweetheart? You know what? You're a trip. I'm not going to apologizefor my success, consuela. Just 'cause you live inthis highrise apartment, and make all this moneyselling houses, that doesn't mean that you'regooder than nobody else. "Better," not "gooder." Gooder, better, whatever. And may I remind you, consuela, I don't sell houses... i own real estate. And I own my own company. And I am the managing partnerof this highrise, which I also happen to co-own. And need I remind you... That I also happento pay your salary. Whoopty-doo. Consuela, you'd betterbe glad I like you. And you'd better be gladthat good help is so hardto find these days. You know, I did like youso much better when you barely spokeany english. The only reasonthat you like me, is becausei'm the only person that has workedfor you this long. Most peopleleave after six months. I've been herefor, like, five years. You wouldn't knowwhat to do without me. You know what I woulddo without you? I would find a maidthat knew her place, and one that spokeno english at all, so she couldn't talk back. That's what I would dowithout you. And who would be stupid enoughto do that? You did. Remember? Whatever. hmmph! Kendall, darling, my love, how are you? Hey, mom. Hey, consuela. Hi, Kendall. I'm just about to come herein the kitchen, and make some hors d'oeuvresfor your phony mama. Honey, is that any wayto greet your mother, and what have I told you aboutfraternizing with the help? Makes them think that they'resort of on your level, you know? Don't do that. Mom, she's like family. And beside, she's the onlyfriend who you have anyway. I don't need friends. I'm rich. Ha ha! Well, I'm not. Kendall, soon you will be, okay. I've been talking to your... your coach, honey. Soon you're going to... You're going to haveso many NFL offers. Trust me, they are coming. And then you will haveyour own money. Do you know why? Because you're good. Because you're good, and because you're a benet. Yes. Kendall, sometimesi look around, I... I just can'tbelieve this. I can't believe that I didall of this by myself, for myself, and for my children. I've sent you and your brotherand your sister to the best collegesand the best universities, so you could haveeverything. Mom, we've heard this growing upall of our lives. You went back to college, you made something of yourself, and you want us to do the same. But I don't wantany of your money. Honey, of course, you do. Everybody wants my money. Kendall, honey, that's what I do. I make money for people. And if, you, young man, are going to recite my resume, my biography, make sure you get it right. "Number one salesperson, number one sales real estateperson in the city, "all of the city, and I opened up my ownsuccessful commercial company." Should I also include this on your spotless resume? What? that you paidthe athletic director to put mein the starting lineup. Honey, that was just an ugly rumorstarted by unfortunate people that were just jealousof our success. That's all that was. So, it's all aboutmoney and power for you, Well, frankly, yes, Kendall. That is what it's about. And you... you're a young man, kendall, that needs to start thinking about how you want the worldto view you. Yeah. okay. Well, didn't you get turned awayby that French boutique? Even with all your money? I mean, didn't they callthe police on you, too? The French are just so... They're bourgeois. You know, they'reso self-absorbed. So that's... thatmakes us different, What about Quentin? What about your brother? He's a successful lawyerwith a fabulous career. What about him? With two divorcesunder his belt. How old is he, 28? Mom, whatis he trying to do? Breakelizabeth Taylor's record? Kendall, marriage is aboutconvenience, and if it doesn't work, you simply move on. You just make sure thatyou have a prenup. Wow. So, when it comes to familyvalues, that's reassuring, mom. Fine. What aboutyour sister Shayla? She has an mba, she hasaspirations of a ph.D. What about her? That's 'causeyour mommie dearest done made her think thatshe's a white chick with a cocoa tan. Don't you havesomething to do? I was just coming in here to tell you that roastis almost ready. Is that okay? Yes. that's very good. Please, no carbs, consuela. I've worked very hardon this figure, and I really want to keep it. And, please, make surethe meat's not too dark. Shayla and Quentin, they don'tlike their meat very dark. I wonder why. I know whatyou're doing with these Sunday dinners. Honey, the only thing that i'mdoing with these Sunday dinners is just trying to know what'sgoing on in your lives. Look, it's all aboutcontrol with you. Q is legal counselof your company. And Shayla, whenever she's there, is supposed to berunning your business. So, you know what's goingon in their lives. And you talk to my coachmore than me, so you definitely know what'sgoing on in my life. Like I said, mom, it's all aboutcontrol with you. Would you please stop it? That's the least of it. It is not about controland, honey, please, don't callyour brother "q." Just... It's sounds so ghetto. Or like he's some radiodisc jockey or something. Don't do that. It doesn't bother himwhat I call him. Well, you know what? It bothers me. Please, do something for me? Don't be so difficult today. Can you do that? And when your brotherand sister get here, please don'tbe so difficult. Would that be so hard for youto do for me, Please? Mom, you've got 'em around herethinking that they're all that. Gosh, all of what, Kendall? Tell me? Proud? rich? Successful? Yes. proud. Rich.Successful. And nothing else. Well, the only thing that mattersin this world is green power... that'sthe only thing that matters. And having plenty of it. Thank god, your sister's here. Shayla, darling. Hello, mother. You look lovely. Thank you. Mother dear. Mwah. mwah. Kendall? So have we signedthat NFL contract yet? Hey, Shayla. How you doing? My god, and, no, not yet. Mother, you will not believewhat just happened to me. So, while the valetwas parking my Porsche, can you believethis poor-looking black guy had the audacityto speak to me? Honey, what did you do? Well, I clutched my Prada, of course. If you playedyour cards right, and worked your jelly, he could've beenyour baby's daddy. That's so gross, consuela. You're so "the help." Don't you have, like, little maid things to do? Girl, he was probably justtrying to say hello. Really, Kendall? Whatever. You know what? You don't give a brothera break, now, do you? If he doesn't haveany money, no. That's my Shayla. You know, I'm about to losemy appetite. A real live golddigger. Like kanye say,"i ain't gonna say she a golddigger, but she ain'tmessing with no..." Excuse me? No. Honey, who... who's kanye? Why don't you get a real joband do some work for a change? Work? ew. That's disgusting. That's what poor peoplelike consuela does. Okay, so, what do you do when you're at mom's officeevery day? I've got that. Because you're never there. Excuse me, you don't seethe queen bee in the beehive doing the work, do you? Exactly. Ain't that why they callher the "b"? Don't you have something to do in the kitchen? Wait, I don't... i don't get it. What does that mean? Ain't nothing wrongwith honest work. So what are you goingto do all day today? Shop, duh. Shayla, you're no betterthan anybody with money or without money. I know you don't thinkyou're gooder than me, just 'cause I workfor your mother? I only work here so I can givemoney back to my family. So I think that makesme a good person. Yes, consuela, you area good person, and I respect you for that. Ha. hmmph. But now, your workis in the kitchen. Ha. No, no, consuela.. We only speak english here. Proper english. Your brother's here. Quentin, darling! Hello, Quentin. Hello, everyone.Mother. Shayla. Hello. Kendall. What's up, bro? i want mine. Mwah. mwah. So... What did I walkinto this time? Nothing. Just mother's happy home, full of warmth and charm. Speaking of homes. Guess what? I have found a perfect placefor you to build outside the city. Gated community, golf course, even has a tennis court. And the prices just startabove 20 mil. Honey, that soundsso charming. That's just what I need... a chateau in the countryside. So, meanwhile, peopleare losing their homes, and there's thousandsof homeless people on the cornerbegging every day. Come on, man, why do you alwayshave to start that talk? Well, does it always haveto be about money? Yes. yes. It's always about money, Mr. contradictingfootball player, who's about to makelots of it. For rich peopleand for poor people, bro, it's always about money. See, you going down that missionplace, and feeding those homeless people has gotyou feeling guilty about success. And you wouldn't even think about going down there, now, would you? You see, you see? Honey, our being wealthy is nothing that we haveto apologize for. Now, come on. Let's go take a seat, okay, at the table, before dinner's served? You know what? I'm not even hungry. You know what? This family is waytoo vain for me. I don't even know whyi was born in this family. Boo-hoo, you know, this guilt trip is starting to become a bore, kendall. Kendall? Please, where are you going? We haven't even eaten dinneryet, honey. You know what, I'm goingto go down to the... To the shelter. Get something to eat there. I'm going to eatwith some real people. Some people who havea little appreciation. That is so gross, kendall. I can't believe he wouldrather go down there, and eat commodity foodat a shelter than eat here. What you doing down here? You sure don't look you neednobody's hand-out. I come down hereto volunteer sometimes, man. I see. He's one of those types. Ha ha ha ha. So, what's the matter? Your pockets too full? Did you come down here to helpthe... the under-class and the disenfranchised folks? Ha ha ha. Look, I'm not, "one of those types." Is that right? Hey, can I have a seat? Be my guest. Some volunteeryou turned out to be. You've been here two minutes, and already you're lookingto take a load off? See, you've got jokes, man. Real funny. You know what, though? You look familiar. Matter of fact, I thinki've seen your picture in the newspaper before. So, you read aboutme in the newspaper? No, I didn't. What I said is that I sawyour picture in the newspaper. I didn't read anything. I needed it for warmth. Understand? Yeah, My bad. So, I mean, you mustbe new around here, man, 'cause I don't even think I've ever seenyou around here before. Where you from? Well, I'm from here and there. I'm like one of them birds... i migrate. So you'reyou coulda traveling man. Say that. But, actually, I'm gettingtired of traveling. You know, it's so rough out here I've been trying to find jobsin other cities. Couldn't do it, so I figuredi'd come here and try my luck. I definitely understandhow that is. So what is itthat you do? Nothing. Nothing? I mean... I graduate from collegein the spring, and I've got a few thingsgoing on. But, hey, I love giving back. Cause besides, it beats hanging outwith my family. Well, that's good. So you must be one of themyoung educated brothers? You're getting ready to getone of them big corporate jobs. Corporate big wig. No, man, I'm into sports. That's what I do. I love that. You know, I usedto be into sports, too, when I was a young buck. Blew my knee out. That was a longtime ago though. Well, you know, it still looks like you'rein pretty good shape, man. I see them pectorials throughall them layers of clothes. Yeah, you got jokes? Well, that's becausei've never snoked, never drank, never wasa crack head or a drug addict. I just caught somebad breaks, but you know what, I'm going to get itall together one day. Hey, man, that's whatyou gotta say, man. One day at a time, brother. Always believe in that. You know what... Yeah, yeah, i know, you gotta go, 'cause you tryingto dodge this butt-whipping I wassetting up for you. You know what, man, maybe next time. Hey, but, if you see brother John, can you tell himthat Kendall came by? We ain't going to seebrother John around hereno time soon. Why is that? That's becausehe just ran from the butt-whippingi gave him before you got here. He probably somewhereputting ointment on that bruised egoof his. All right, man. Well, I hopei see you around. You will, young fella. I'll see ya. Looks like you can drawor something. You some kind of artist? Well, excuse me, miss Picasso. I'm just trying topay you a compliment. I'm just tryingto be nice, but I guess you don'tneed no compliment when it comes fromthe help. I'm not ignoring you, okay, so don't be so dramatic. I was just tryingto be nice. Well, I don't need youto be nice to me. Do you ever see mebeing nice to you? No, I don't think so. Why do you gottabe like that? Consuela, you act like you'reone of my friends. You're not oneof my friends, and you're definitely notone of my sorority sisters. You're just the help. You know, I can takethat from miss benet because she pays my salary. But you, you don't evenlive here. And you're right, i am the help, but I'm a people, too. It's "person," not "people." People, person, you know what I mean. And to tell you the truth, I don't even think thatyour uppity family is all that great... Even with all their money. Excuse you?! I done seen betterpeople with nothing. You know, and since I'm talking, I'm going to just go aheadand say it. You're mean. You have nevertried to be nice to me. You are a spoiled brat. Such a waste. Who do you think you aretalking to me like that? You don't even know anythingabout me, consuela. You've never even sat and talkedwith me about anything. My own mother doesn't evenknow anything about me. I'm so sorryi said that. I mean, I... I really believe that you couldbe a good person, you know, if you tried. I mean, why do you always gottabe fake, you know? And pretend likeyou're so important. You know, you probably wouldn't even believe thisif I told you... But I'm so unhappy. Like, most of the time, I just feel empty. I never... Knew that. I mean, I know your mother. She really... It's just stuff, you know? And if you ask me, my mom feelsjust as empty as I do. She won'tadmit it though. But you have everything. But it's just stuff. It's material superficialstuff, consuela. It doesn'teven mean anything. Do you know, like, i'm not even this person that everyonethinks that I am. Whatever. Like, I think my mom enjoys watching me be, like, a spoiled rich brat or something. Like, I'm not eventhat person. I don't want tobe like her. I don't want to belonely and empty. Do you know that I don'teven have any friends? Like, you'rethe closest thing I have to a friend. It sucks! Kind of like a sister I just don't getalong with sometimes. I had no idea. I had no idea. Quentin! Thank godyou're here. Hey, Shayla. Hey. So... Where's mother? Um, I actuallydon't know. I think she hada meeting earlier with a clientor something. Really? yeah. Why would she be meetingwith a client... And especiallyon a Sunday afternoon? I really don't know. I guess it was importantor something. Well, obviously. She didn't even call meor mention it to me. I only work in the office, quentin. I really don't know, okay. Well, I'm sure she'lltell me later on. So where's Kendall boy? Do these look likesecretary hands to you? Like I take phone calls? I don't know, Quentin. I have no idea where he is. So how was yourday today, Mr. benet? It was great. I went to the golf course. I hit a hole in oneon a par four. Hey, um... Can you make me a Martini? You know exactlyhow I like it, right? Yeah, okay. You know, I'm just curious toknow what this meeting was about that mother had to attendon a Sunday afternoon. Here comesmr. Dramatic. Okay. Look, I needone of those, too. What's wrong with you? Really? like, do we even care? Here's your Martini, mr. Quentin. Well, it must be serious. You don't even drink. Look, can you believethey're trying to shut down the shelter? Like, who cares? Can't they just go find another run-down buildingsomewhere else? That place is hometo a lot of those people. Why do you care aboutwhere they live, as long as they havea shelter, Kendall? Look, you don't understand. The shelter justdoesn't have money to just get up and move. Wait, we're talkingabout that place on second avenueand Hudson, right? Yeah, how do you know? Um... I do readthe paper, Kendall. I heard that there'ssome investors who want to get thatentire area re-zoned. So they can go in and tear downthose buildings and let some rich developersbuild highrise condominiums? Kendall, the sheltercan relocate across town somewhere. Look, all they have isa lease. Look, they don't evenown the building. And they sure as hell can't afford it, either. Well, like mother says, it just doesn't payto be poor. You know what? Shut up! And it doesn't pay to beignorant either! Look, why don'tyou just go somewhere? Look, Kendall, why are youstressing yourself? What can you do about it? Nothing. Why don't you just help themfind another place, if it's so important? Q? You're a lawyer, right? Yes. Look, I wouldn't ask youif it wasn't important. Here we go. Look, man, I need your help to keepthese people from losing their homesand their shelters. You need my what? Q, I wouldn't ask you if ididn't need your help, man. I need you to fight this. There goes the helpword again. Look... Okay, I'll try to help you, all right? But, honestly, I don'tknow what I can do. And, bro, I just boughtthis outfit, please. All right, cool. You know what, consuela? I don't need it. You know I don't drink. You know I do. Stop it. I'll nurse it. Hello, hello, hello! I hope thati haven't kept everybody waiting too long for dinner. A fresh Martini? You must have knowni was coming. I'm going to give you a kiss. Mwah! the other one, too. Mwah! i'm so excited. I just had the business meetingof all times. I've... I am... Quentin, do you understand howproud you are going to be of me? I met with a gentlemanwho represents an international investment firmfrom South Korea. Me, ha! Thank you. Well, that's great, mother. But why wouldn't you ask meto attend this meeting? I'm your legal counsel. And why you? Why your company? There are otherreal estate companies that are larger in this citythat they can use. Because she has it, you know. She knows how towork her jelly. Well, I guessi do, whatever that means. And why not me? Why not my company? This is going to bea huge deal. And I want to be a partof every bit of it. Well, that's great. But, mother, you don't evensell property anymore. Well, this isn't aboutselling property. This is about making a deal. And I have tons... Tons of connections. This deal, consuela, could be worth tens of millionsof dollars, and there is no way, no way that I'm not going tobe personally involved with everyaspect of it. I'm so excited. My feet hurt. Well, I trust your instincts, mother. I'm sure it will bea success, so... What's this deal about? Okay, Quentin, just listen to me. Listen to me, darling. I'm going to need you, do you understand? Me and you. Your undivided attentionon every bit of this. Do you understand, honey? Mommy needs you. I need you. And I've made thoreenaware of it, too. Okay, mwah! What, thoreenthe assistant? You mean the girlwho does Shayla's job? I heard you! You leave your sister alone, young man. Thoreen is myexecutive assistant. And maybe, if you just came by my officea little bit more, you know, you two... You know, she's very cute. You should be lookingfor a lady. She is, bro. I love you, guys. I think she hastoo much caffeine or something. So you're not going to leave mehanging on this, right, q? I said I would help you. Look, q, would you stop staring at people? Bro, I can't help it. Did you see thatwoman outside? She was pushinga shopping cart with dirty laundryin it. Dirty laundry! Bro, where's the laundromataround here? Look, she's homeless. Look, they have things, too, man. Are you sure we're going to besafe in this neighborhood? Because I don't anybodymessing with my benz. Look, we could havetook the bus, like I suggested. I'm sorry, but I don't dopublic transportation. Okay, well, good. I hope your insuranceis paid up then. Hey, Kendall, that's not funny. Take thatsmile off your face. That's not funny. Okay, look, I'm sorry. Look, there's plentypolice around here. Your car will be fine, all right? What is that smell? No wonder you never toldmother about this place. No wonder I told any ofyou guys about this spot. Well, this is it, man... The love you save mission. So I see. And this is whereyou come down to eat at.

So tell me, bro, why are you doing this? Because all of thatis not enough. Speak for yourself. It's enough for me. Just let me havea Martini and I'm happy. You're just like yourtwo ex-wives? You don't evensee your sons. Hey, look, I take care ofmy sons, okay. I send them child support on time every month. Wow! child support. That's good. They need your time, q. I think that'sa little bit more better than money. Kendall, will you getoff of your high horse? Look, our father wasn't aroundwhen we were growing up, and we turned outall right, okay? Daddy diedwhen we were little... When you were a baby. And mother... yes, mother... She did whatevershe had to do to survive to get through that. And I think she dida pretty good job. We turned out just fine. Q, you're not dead, so you could spend timewith your kids. I don't know. Maybe you're right. Where's John? You know what, man? Mom never ever talkedabout pops to us, ever. Look, I remembergoing to school, and kids would saymean things like... "you ain't got no daddy." Yeah, I know. And they didn't even knowour daddy was dead. But, hey, man, kids can be cruel. And I know you don't wantthat for your kids, man. Well, well, well. What's up, young brother. I see you brought somebodywith you today.

You know, i don't even think I even want to hearany more of this. I'm startingto feel sick. And I don't even thinkit's coming from this alcohol drink. You told them I was dead? I... I might have feltlike I died, but I don't remember dying. You may as wellhave been dead. You were dead to me. You guys. This is not easy to talk about. You know what, look. We need to hearright here, right now. Look, we gotall the time in the world. Yeah, because I want to hear just... How and when I died. Yeah, me, too. I didn't tell themthat you died. Mother did. That woman. Mother. I just... I guess I just didn't tell themthat you were alive. So... They believed what she said. No, you letthem believe it. Too proud, right? To let them knowi didn't live up to yourmother's expectations. Same old Alicia. Miss pride. I don't need a manfor nothing. Just like your mother. Why shouldn'ti be proud? You tell me! You stand thereand you look around, and you tell mewhy I shouldn't be proud. Tell me. You look... look! Look at what I've done. And look at what i'veaccomplished. Look at what I've acquired, and I... I did it without you. Do you hear me?! I did it without you! I gave them everything! Everything. They've gone to colleges and look at them! She was right. I didn't need you. Did it ever occur to you thatthey needed their father? Did it ever occur to you that they neededtheir father?! These are my children. These are my seeds. Don't you do it. Don't you sit there and blame this all on me. This was your fault, not mine! My fault?! My... How is it my fault when you toldthese kids I was dead? Look, mom, you should have told us. You could have told us that ourfather was alive! He left... He left me. He... you did. You left me, you left me! Alicia, don't youtwist this! Look, everybodyjust calm down, okay? I mean, what's sufficientevidence is there anyway to prove conclusivelythat he's even our father? Look, dude, thisis not no courtroom! Q, we ain't doingno DNA test. Can't you see this manis our father?! This is justtoo much for me. We were young, honey. We were. We were so young. And... And we had a babyon the way. I was supposedto go to college, but... Your father hadother plans for me. We were young. We were young, alicia. But we didn't need nothingbut each other's love, our love. Love? what does love haveto do with anything? Love doesn't paythe bills. No, it doesn't. And there I was pregnant with Quentin. My mom hated me for it. But she hated him even more forwhat he'd done to me. For what we did, Alicia. What we did. We had thesethree babies together, all three of them. Yes. You're right. We did have thesethree babies together. But you know what? I fed them. Me. I clothed them, me! I took care of them! I... I educated them! I gave them everythingwithout you! Me! And now you have the audacity to come in hereand just ruin everything. You're ruining everything. God, William, why did you come here? Why did you come here? Don't you get it? We were supposedto be a family. These are my children. We were so young. Right out of high school. What did we have, high school diplomas, and what were we supposed to do? How were we goingto take care of them? Were we just going to... Keep on flipping burgers? No, Alicia. But with god on our side, in time, I know thatwe would have made it. We would have made it. Well, you know what? All of that'sin the past now. It is. Do you hear me? It's all in the past. You're in the past. So let it go. Do you understand? Let it go. It's time for you... To get out of my house. Listen to me. Get out of my house. Get out! You, get outof my house! I want you out! I want youout of my house. You know what, i can't even believe this. I can't believe this! Man, something... Something pulled at me, man. No. Look, something told meto go to that place... That shelter. And out of seven billionpeople in the world, I find my father, who I thought was dead, living at a shelter. Kendall, honey... Look, don't "Kendall" me! Look, you lied to me, and you lied to us! Kendall, that's your mother. Show some respect. How you going to tell meto show some respect?! You left her, right?! You left me, and you left us! Kendall, I'm sorry. Sorry?! Sorry? Sorry? Look, sorry is sorry. You're a sorry excusefor a man. No wonder your lifeis messed up! Because you didn'tdo right by us! And you didn't do right by me! I can't believeyou said "son." You left that titlea long time ago. So you have no rightto call me your son. You weren't even therefor my first... My first football game. When I scoredmy first touchdown. When I got my first trophy. So how you gonna call me... How are you gonna call meyour son? I gotta get out of here, man. You guys disgust me! Man, why don't you go back towhere you came from! Kendall? Kendall, wait, man! Man, shut up! Ken... You want to talk about fair, you took everything from me! Everything. I am living in a homeless shelter. I don't live atsecond street, I live on second street, and you want to talkabout fair? You live ata homeless shelter? Yes, I did. But there's some bigreal estate developer... Wait a minute. On second street? Mother, isn't thatthe same property that... No, no, no, honey, you must be confused. No, mother. You and Quentin were heretalking about it earlier. That is the sameexact property that you and your investorsare trying to buy. My god. My god. So you're the developer? I might have somethingto do with it. Who's to say? Kendall told methat his mom was in real estate. Yep, yep, yep, yep. Now I see. Now I see how you made all your money... Putting po' folksout on the street. What I doand how I do it is none of your business. And I will not let you standthere and blame me for where it is you live. No, no, you'reabsolutely right. You see, what you dois your business. It's just notmy kind of business. I busted my butt, William. I did, to givethem everything they could possiblywant or need. Did it ever occur to you they might needtheir father? Did it?! Look, I'm not makingany excuses, all right? I was young... we were young. I didn't know whatit was to be a father. But that gave you no rightto take my children. No, you don't havethe right to say that 'cause you left our mother. You left us. Shayla, I swear I neverleft your mother. That's right. You did leave. You did leave. Yeah, for an hour. I took a walkin the park, because I did not want tofight in front of the kids. Now, you know howyou used to get. How I used to get. How I used to get. So, everybody argues. So what, you guys argued! Was it so bad that you guyscouldn't just work it out?! Over what? A picture. A silly picture. A photograph of somebodyi knew in high school. Is that true, mother? You guys arguedover a picture? And it grew from there. Yeah, that it did. And then you keptaccusing me and accusing meof not trusting you. You didn't trust me. You never trusted me. And then you startedtelling me you didn't want me no more. You know, you saidsome ugly and cruel things. So the only thingi could do was leave. See? you left! But I came back. I always came back. Then one day, i left for work. And came home to nothing. Everything was gone. The only thing you leftwas the wedding ring, like it wasabsolutely nothing. Did you even tryto look for us? I looked everywhere. I looked all overthe country. I kept all the lettersthat I sent. I sent it tothe old address and her mother's address, and all I ever got wasreturn to sender. Well, why didn't you at least try looking for usin the phone book?! I didn't know nothingabout Alexis benet. I know Alicia Bennett. Alicia d... Alicia Daniels, after we were married. Man, just look at us. Just a bunch of empty souls. Money, success... Nothing. Nothing but just lies, all lies. Well... That's way too deep, bro. Plus, I think I've hadway too many drinks. I know I'm a lawyer, but... I'm not that deep. What about Shayla, man? What you mean? I mean, we left herup there by herself. To tell you the truth, so much going on, I forgot we left herup there by herself like that. You know what he said? That he never left her. So why wouldhe lie about that? I mean, he has nothingto gain. And mom's been controllingour lives ever sincewe were little. So maybe she justran him off. Maybe, Kendall. Who knows? You know, truthfully, I never imagined our fatherto be like that. Not like that. I had ideas of a blackclark Kent... A superhero of some sort. But that man is strong. He's been throughhell and back. Yeah. You know what? Maybe mom willjust be honest and tell usthe whole story. Maybe. Look, come on. Let's... Let's go back upstairsand check on them. Plus, motherput him out before, I'm sure she won't hesitateto do it again. And, besides, i think we left Shayla up therelong enough by herself. You feeling all right? Yeah. I guess. Let's go, bro. Come on. Just try to imagine yourwhole world being snatched awayfrom you just like that. I don't regret what I did. So, mother... You left? No, honey... You left and changed your name? Honey! You changed your name find us on purpose. Honey, no... don't touch me. Honey, none ofthis matters. No, it does matter! You did do it, you did do it, didn't you?! It doesn't... none of this matters. Why would you do thatto us?! Why would you dothat to this man and put him through this? Shayla, honey, I had to. I did have to. What is wrong with you? No.you are so messed up. You are so beyondmessed up. No, sweetie, look at you. You're perfect. You understand, he didn'tgive you that. I gave you that. You didn't give himthe choice! You took thatchoice from him. You took thatchoice from us! Don't touch me. Shayla, don't go anywhere! Get off me! Get off of me! No, Shayla! Honey, Shayla, it's me! Don't go anywhere! Shayla! come on! Shayla, let'sjust talk about it. Don't... don'tcome near me. Don't you talk to me! Kendall, I thinkit's time for me to go. Hey, guys. I don't think we shouldleave Billy here. He'll stay with you? Sure, why not? Hey, Billy? We're not going toleave you here. We want you to come with us. You're sure? my gosh, my mother... She just hated the idea... Hated the idea! And she hate himeven more. Why? Well, you know, I was... Well, I was young, you know, and I had all thesepossibilities. I had been accepted to allthese, you know, offers from all of these collegesand universities. And she just... She just never thought that he was going to amountto anything. Yeah, but look at you. I mean, you're rich, you're successful, you're smart, and you could have donethat with a husband. I mean, you did it withthree kids. Yeah. But, you know, the moreshe meddled, you know, she meddled and meddledand meddled. And, you know, she was Justin my ear constantly. And things just gotworse and worse. And, you know, then I... I started seeingthings her way, you know? And it was like the seedshad been planted, and then once the seedswere planted, it was just... whoo! It was just sortof downhill from there. Yeah. Well, I don't know whyfamilies don't stick together throughthick and thin. I think the families dostick together, consuela. You know, mamaand babies. You know, who needs a daddy? That's what I usedto hear, yeah. Yeah, but every baby needsa mami and a papi. Even if the only kind of work you can findis throwing newspapers? And flipping burgers? And cleaning up offices? That was the kind of workthat William used to do. Well, I don't understandthat, miss benet. Okay, because workis work. There areworse things, no? Tell that to my mom... God rest her soul. I didn't knowyou believed in god. You don't go to church, and I never seen no bibleor nothing. Well, consuela, i'm just not sure what I believe in anymore. You know what? Come here. Well, I do believe. And it makesmy life Fuller. You know, whatam I to say anyway? You know, 'causei'm just the help. You're not just the help, and you know that. You're my friend. And right now, you're probably the only friendi have. Probably. So what are you goingto do now, miss benet? What do you mean? Well, your lifehas changed. You have to see how to mendthe seams from the past. Yeah. The past. That's probablywith Kendall. He was always searchingfor something in the past. Shayla and Quentin, they were fine. They were fine becausethey had me and they clung tightto me. But Kendall? I don't know. He's a little bitdifferent. Kendall isvery different. But like in a good way, you know? He's gota really good heart. A really good heart. And wanna know what? He's just like his father. It's true. He has a good heart. That's whyi married him. I mean, he just... He was never intothis stuff, any stuff. Just like Kendall. He was just sort ofsweet and innocent. He was a man witha really good heart. Well, that's what Kendall'salways going to be. Kendall!

Don't I at least geta hello from everyone? Especially you, consuela. You happen to look divine. Thank you. I do look good, don't I? Mother, where have you been? We are starving and we havebeen waiting forever. I'm sorry, honey, I justhad some business that I had to take care of. I'm sure you're allvery hungry. I didn't know that you wanted meto cook something because we spent the whole dayin that kitchen serving all those people... It's okay. You know what, mom, is thatwhat you called us here for? So we can act like onebig happy family? No, that's not what I calledyou here for. I wanted you all here, you know, at home, this home. I just... I just wantedto make things right. Mother, I don't think you couldfix things after 20 some-odd years. Don't you think the damagehas already been done? Listen, son, I'm notdamaged goods, all right? Nor do I want you to be, so don't make your mom outto be the villain. Let's just try to get pastwhat has happened. Thank you. I just... I just want my kids back. I want my family back. I love you very much, and I'm so sorryfor everything that I did. I just... I just needanother chance, that's all. How you goingto make this up? How you going to makethis up to our father? Kendall, look, we're still living. We're living. Time can heal a lot of thingsand if it can't, then what's the sense of usbelieving in anything? Pleaseforgive me, William. I've changed. I have. I've changed. I've changed, william. It's right there. Okay... Here, take it! Mom, you just can'tthrow money away. I mean, you can't usemoney to solve your problems or pay off our father, he's in our lives now. Look, I think... I think what your mamais trying to say is a lot more valuable thanmoney or even me, all right? what isthis check for, then? Kendall, just take it! Don't you know not to looka gift horse in the mouth? Besides, she could changeher mind any minute. I met with an investortoday, Kendall. We wrote an offeron the property. The shelteris no longer yours. So it's done? So the... So the shelter's notgoing to be closed down? No, baby. I convinced them, well... Sort of told them itwould be bad social policy, have a negative impacton valuable lives. Mother, are you serious? You really bought the building? So those people don'thave to move? Not as long as I havesomething to do with it. I mean... I mean, that's goodfor right now, but what aboutfurther down the line? Whoever wants to fight is goingto have to fight me. And they won't want that. So, Kendall, honey, that's what the checkis for. Official ownershipof the shelter. Who needs another chateau and all that stuff? Don't need that. I think your mom is reallyserious. Besides, you never know... The love you savemight be your own. So, is this allfor real? Are you sure you'regoing to leave it alone? No high-rise condos? No high-rise condos. I won't change anything. It will stay exactlythe same. Maybe just a fewlittle improvements. That should be okay, right? So, mom, what made youdecide to do this? Kendall, honey, don't ask why. Sometimes... Sometimes things just happenfor a reason. Just... just rejoice in itand let it be. Everything is wonderful, mom, and I'm happy that all these people got a place to call their home, and clearly we would neverlet you go back there. I guess what I'm saying isthat I just don't think it's right for us to haveand you to be without. That's sweet, baby girl, but don't assume anything. I have more than youcould ever imagine. And I've gotfaith back after all these years. This is so beautiful, miss benet. This makes me feelso good. There's just one thing leftfor me to do. Um... come here. William... You're the fatherof my children. And, aside from them, you're probably the best thingthat's ever happened to me. Do you think that maybe... Time heals all things and godcan make people whole again... With time, just maybe... With some time, he can healwhat we once had? What we once had? What we once hadwas a real family. A real family. Alicia, i just don't know. I mean... I just don't know. Daddy, say yes. Yeah. Maybe in time... I could becomethe kind of woman that you'd be proudto call your wife. I think... "Alicia Daniels" doesn'tsound so bad after all. So, who did you call? I just called my son's mother. I'm going to pick my sons upthis weekend and spend some q-t, quality time, with them. Besides, I think it's about time that they meet theirgrandfather. That's wonderful, quentin, it really is. Kendall, this was never reallyabout the shelter. This was aboutmaking lives whole again. Theirs and ours. And I believe that we can beginto make things right. Starting withone family at a time. You know, I've beena lot of places in my life, I've seena lot of horrible things, but there was one thingthat I held on to, very, very dear to me, and I think I have something that belongsto you. You kept that? This is the ring he gave me whenwe were first married. He kept the ring! Remember how littleyour mom said it was? My mom hated this ring! I love this ring! I love you. I do love you. I love you. I gotta see this ring. See? I told youabout this ring! Do you remember? I thoughta lot of it. Wow, mom... You never know, the love yousave may be your own. Yeah. Hallelujah! There it isright there. Jesus lives! Jesus lives! Are you glad about it? Hallelujah! ve! I'm going to church.
