The police came and took him and his cousins There were some juice on the table and they thought it was alcohol Will you please release my son? I don't care about his cousins! I don't work there. I just have to do something. Plus, you should go to the committee. It's not related to the army All the wrong things are related to the committee It's a histerical laughter I'll get off at the office of the army, sir Will you turn down the volume, Hamid? I put Ehsan to bed It's a comedy. Why are you so serious? -You can learn serious stuff from a comedy -Tell Hamid to do the things he already learned I said I'll fix the mosaics in the morning Don't pour it there You should've done it sooner. The snow won't let them dry Yes but I wasn't home You were in Urumia -Do you know what your only problem is? -What? -You procrastinate what you gotta do -No, I said I'll fix it before we move -I'm not talking about this. You were supposed to fix that problem -OK Sure, I will You just say it It's hard for you to tell me to write a letter of repentance. You refer to it as a "problem" -I need you in my army -Say the word and I'll be there Our friends are there to help you. I'll be at your service whenever you need me Hamid I'm not asking you to become my assistant because you're my brother. I'm asking because you're trained You were in Suria, Lubnan and Felesteen. You know tactics for the battles -It's balanced -No, it's not Go write it and get this over with The problem is I don't know what to write, what to repent for Hamid, write anything they asked Have you seen anyone better than our brother Ali? He was executed and his body was never found They were Muslims. People are writing letters and tell Mohsen Rezaei to remove me from being a commandar They're still mentioning that thing. Now what should I do? Leave Saddam? Leave Imam's orders and see who's gossiping? -Are you greater than Martyr Beheshti? -I didn't complain. I just said I don't know what to write Write something in general. You have to get into army again so that you can be my assistant -OK, I'll go and write it -When? Mehdi, I didn't wanna say this but I went to the office of the army of Tabriz five times But I don't know if the commandar was busy or what... It didn't get done. -You went there and they didn't do anything? -I'm sure they didn't have time -I'll handle it myself. Don't say anything -I won't -Don't pick them up. They're heavy. Your wounds get hurt -It's fine -How are they by the way? -They're OK. They're just itchy sometimes -Turn around -Why? -Hamid? -Yes Sorry you had to wait. We were a little busy -We've been told that you should write and sign something in front of us -Yes, a letter of repentance -I'm sorry. It's an order -It's OK. I just don't know why I should repent I write something in general. I repent for the wrong things I've done in the past and the things I might do in the future -Will you please give me a pen and a paper? -Right away -Do you want some tea? -No, thanks This mission is different than any other missions before Some of you were in Ramadan or Muslim ibn Aqil missions Know that this mission has no coming back! You'll either become a martyr or will be kept captive by the end of this mission Anyone who has a problem Has a family, a sick person to take care of is excused. You can choose not to come You can choose not to come and stand here and no one can blame you But if you decide to stay and participate in the mission, you know what's gonna happen You have to fight like Imam Hussain This has to be a hidden mission! Don't make a lot of sound! Pray quietly Akbar! Got my back on the Judgement Day. You owe me. -Bagher? Sorry Mehdi. We were busy Rasoul said he has moved towards you He's not here. We have no weapon and Iraqis are close to us -What happened to your hand? -It's OK. The situation's bad -They don't have any weapon -I sent them They're not receiving them. Iraqis are attacking hard Come here -Stop -I love you, Mehdi Drive safely I asked you to send the guys some weapons -I sent them weapons, twice -They didn't receive it Give me some. I'll deliver it myself -I don't understand Turkish -I said help me get the injured in the helicopter It's dangerous. They will shoot it [Majnoon island/Kheybar Mission/ Esfand of 1362] Pull over Go back! Don't come! The weapons are here Why are you sitting here? I'm talking to you I'm talking to you! Are you injured? Why are you sitting here then? -Why aren't you delivering the weapons? -They're shooting! Have you no shame? The guys need weapons! -If I stand up, they shoot me -Go through the channel then I swear I can't -Why? -I'd have to walk on my friends' corpses. I don't have the heart to do that Run! -Where's your helmet? -It fell -Be careful -Nothing happens to a bad guy Thanks -They're shooting hard -Is this all? It's in the channel. I need two people to help me Do you have any water? I don't know where it fell off It's the tank! Go! Abalfazl! Get in there! -Run! Don't waste weapons! -Hamid, when we shoot the tank, it comes back Don't waste bullets! Let it come closer Go and shoot the tank Shoot the tank! Shoot its continuous track No one's here The office of army's empty. I have to take the kids to Islam Abad They have a fever, I have to get them to the doctor. I came back in a hurry and left all the drugs -If I come now, I'll arrive there in the afternoon -I'll place the key under the flower pot. -Okay -Bye then It's OK, son. I was peeling an onion earlier. That's why I'm crying You're my man and now you wanna take us to the doctor Let me bring Asieh so that we can go Come here, darling Ehsan! Let's go Go. Put on your shoes [Kheybar mission/ Esfand 6th of 1362] Is it a seagull or am I being delusional? Put it on your head so that you don't get shot! Come here, Mohammad! Run! What's up? -Why did you spill the tea? -Seriously, Khosro? In this situation? I wanted to take a break and drink some tea but you ruined it. Sorry, Khosro -Who was that black guy, Mohammad? -Who? -The one who was running with you -It's Yaghchian -No kidding? His face turned black I didn't recognize him -Your face is dirty and black, too -Really? A lot? -Yes Look at the injury on my face! I'm a veteran, too! -Come on and let's go -Why? What's going on? Molavi said I should take you back. We're the only one left from the mission information guys We should take this guy. He's injured. And also Hamid's body -We take the injured but can't take the body -Why not? Mehdi said if you could bring everyone's body, you're allowed to bring Hamid's too We can take him and say we didn't know his order -Tell me which one it is. I will bring him -The one who's there. Look Hamid's the one with the blue jacket Stop! For God's sake! Please stop! Stop! Pass the ball Go. Shoot From Yaghchian to Mehdi -Take all the injured to the back -All the drivers went to the north island Alright. I myself will drive the loader Wake up, Khosro! The bridge has fell off The bridge has fell. Iraqis are walking towards us through the channel Tanks are passing! Go and stop their army! Mohammad, wait for me to come -I wanna go with Mohammad -Stay. I need you here -Mohammad! God bless your burnt car! -Go away! -Don't beat yourself up -That was a waste, Khosro -It's not like it was your own car -I'd be less upset if it was Wow! -Bahman! Did you see Mohammad? -He was in the channel. He should be back any minute -Give me some tea -Go away! Excuse me, Mostafa. May I have a word? Yes, Khosro? -Why isn't Mohammad back yet? -He will. You called me to ask this? -No. I made tea for you and Mehdi -Take it to him I feel shy around commandars. You take it Mehdi has ordered to make a volunteer group of our guys and the army of Najaf To go at night and attack Iraqis' tanks. See who's ready. Are you listening? -Yes, sir -See who's ready to go with them You don't go. I have work for you OK sir -Why don't you answer me? -I have a lot to do -Where's Mohammad? -How should I know? -He was with you -He'll be back -For the love of God, tell me where he is? -We were fighting the Iraqis in the channel and he was the first one to go Be careful! Throw each tank only one grenade Throw them and come back quickly. Walk in a zigzag way so that they can't see you when they turn the lights on Don't be scared. It's Ghadir -Where have you been? -What happened to the tanks? They backed off -How many of the guys survived? -Only you I looked for you and didn't find you. I thought you became a martyr I prayed and cried! Come on, let's go -Did Mostafa find out I was gone with them? -Yes and he was very mad You go, bro. I stay and tell you if anything happens with the bridge -They backed off -I wanna look for Mohammad's body Mehdi said that when tanks back off, we should go to Hamid bridge for guys' bodies -Hamid?! -Shohitat bridge. Guys changed its name -Do you think Mostafa will let me come with you? -If you make some good tea for him -Let's go and let that Iraqi rest -What Iraqi? Oh My God! Did you see the birds, too?

They were like brothers God bless him Let's go and bring the bodies. There's lots of them at the end of the channel I hope you become martyrs. Let's go Help me put him on my shoulders Your commandar didn't let people bring his brother back but you're taking your friend first? Shame on you! I'm Khosro. I'm not Mehdi Bakeri! Thanks Mohammad. You got my back, bro Did you see how I beat them? I love you, Mohammad! I swear you're my best friend! I swear I'm telling the truth Do you love me, too? -I'm talking to you, Mohammad! -You're chocking me, Khosro! I can't breathe nor talk Sorry -Let's go and make a brother deal on Ghadir day -Don't make me laugh. My hands go limp and you fall!

It's nice -Do you want some? I can't eat anymore -No, I'm barely eating mine Are you sure? Give it to me then! You said you couldn't eat anymore! -It's beautiful, Mehdi -Where are we, by the way? Tell them where we are -Don't tease her. It's Karon -I knew it! I just couldn't remember! -Now that we said it? -I knew it, Hamid -Where is here specifically? -The Beach of Karon No! -This is Labe Karon -Yeah, right She didn't get it, did she? You really don't know what Labe Karon is?! *Singing a song* [Ahvaz/Farvardin of 1362] Hi Mehdi! -I missed you! -They will see us! I couldn't help it -Your cloak is dirty now -It's fine -What heppened to your foot? -Nothing. It hurts a little -I wish you'd told me you're coming. I only made salad for myself -I'll eat that -I'll cook something -No need -I just need to take a shower -The water heater is broken -Can you warm the water for me? -Of course Put your hands aside. Let me wash it -Isn't it hot? -Yes, I'm gonna burn you You have the potential! Grab the role -Take it. I'm scared -No one's in the road. Help me take this off Look at this -You're drowned in your thoughts -No -I was just staring at the road -God bless Hamid God bless him When you went to Urumia, was Fatemeh upset with me? Because of Hamid's body No, she didn't say anything but your sister, Zahra was upset Fatemeh has distracted herself with her kids. Take it -Ehsan doesn't bother her? -A little. He's a kid after all. But he understands He can see everyone's upset When Hamid became a martyr, I thought poor Fatemeh, how can she raise two kids on her own? Now I understand how much God must love her, to give her two kids They keep Hamid's memory alive -Mehdi? -Yes? Nothing What did you wanna tell me? -Now that you said it, say it completely -Why can't I talk to you, Mehdi? -Why? Did I say something? -Whenever I talk to you, I'm afraid I might upset you I talked about Hamid's children. You might get upset and think I meant something I swear I didn't think for a second that it might mean something Well, maybe I did! I did everything you asked me to. You said let's go to the doctor and I said sure -We went to Tabriz 'cause they were better -Don't answer me like this, please I can't talk to you when you answer me like this When can I talk to you? You're here now I understand that you have a lot of problems to think about But whenever you come, you go quickly to a mission or a meeting or something like that Did you get that I leave the windows open even in the winter? Because I wanna hear your car and accompany you I have you this less and I'm satisfied In the island, there was 300 meters distance between us and the bodies Iraq couldn't pass through us. They filled the place with water so we had to back off I stand there every evening and look at the bodies, under the water Nothing can make me move. You know what's the only thing that makes me come back to reality and organize everything again? Thinking about home, about you. You're not only my wife, Safieh You're my girl, my mother, my sister, my father, my family -Are you telling the truth? -Yes, I am. Do you feel better now? Don't say anything like that again Promise? Now give me the orange! Wait. Let me go and then go inside -Where are you going? -Have some work to do. See you at night -Come in. Rest and have some tea -No, it's OK -My mom will be upset if you don't come in -Apologize to her on behalf of me I'll see them at night. Your father will be here, too -Do you need anything? -No -Why are you looking at me like that? -Do you know what I remembered? The night we got married. I asked you why you wouldn't look at me -Now I look at you. Do you like it? -Yes -I learned. Can I go now? -Go I'll see you tonight. Bye Mehdi Nothing You're crazy! -Go inside -I will Eat your food Ehsan, you won't be strong if you don't eat -God bless him -Thank you very much. It was delicious Where's Ehsan?! Your hand will hurt. I slap myself so that you laugh -You're here. Is he OK now? -Yes, he is -Come and lay in my arms -You two remind me of Ali God bless him He used to bring books and tell us whoever studies better, will win the book -Hamid would always win -Zahra! Keep it together! -Don't! The kid's here -He was our youngest sibling Come here Maryam! Come and take the kid with you It's alright -Take him -Go. I'll be there in a second -Can I come in? -Of course. Have a seat -Did the guests leave? -No, they're still here -It's too early for drying greens? -I have to distract myself I bought a large amount of them and I'm drying them -If you have a lot, give me some, too -Of course. -I dried Tareh too. Take some and make Koofteh with it -Thank you Your commandar came to the mosque and had a speech. It was crowded He gave you and Hamid lots of compliments He said you'd send Hamid to all the hard missions They were all proud of you They said that you didn't let them bring his body back. You left him with others Why Mehdi? -Why? -Dear... Wasn't he our brother? -Why didn't you let them bring his body back? -Don't say this -Stay calm -How? My heart's burning -He wasn't only your brother -Cry slowly. Fatemeh will hear you -Hamid made a deal with God -We don't know what happened to Ali and now you left Hamid, too If we had his body, his family wouldn't move to Qom Don't carry the heavy stuff. The workers are here -Is Ehsan upstairs? -Yes -You left him alone? Maybe he falls -No, he's in the room -Don't put pressure on your leg -Go and take care of the baby Mehdi -Yes? -Thanks. We've caused you trouble -No. I did what I had to do -The kids and I appreciate it I have a question. Why are you beating yourself up? -I'm not -Safieh said Zahra complained to you -I swear to Hamid's soul, I'm not upset with you -But I didn't say anything... He made a deal with God and I did the same. I don't blame it on you I'm sure Hamid would do the same if he was in your situation -I just wanted to tell you, don't think for a second that I'm upset with you -Thanks for telling me this Your leg hurts. Please don't carry the heavy stuff. The workers do it Thanks -I will pay him -No, let me do it Thank you, sir -Here you are -Thanks *Explaining the plan for Badr mission* We explained this all before. You know we have few weapons and facilities We asked for boats and you said you don't have them We asked for fireworks and you said you don't have them We asked for better weapons and you said you don't have them Mr. Kazemi, we heard this all a hundred times Mehdi This is exactly what happened in Kheybar. Some groups fought and became martyrs But some other groups backed off quickly We saw it in Kheybar. If we fight like that again in Badr, we'll be the victors If Imam hadn't ordered us to fight in Kheybar mission, we would lost the islands -We backed off because we couldn't fight anymore -You and I are alive here. So we could've fought more I asked my guys to come back None of them did. They became martyrs But other armys backed off soon This happens when a commandar stands back and orders others to fight A commandar must get in line and fight and tell his army to come, not to go [East side of Dejleh/ Badr Mission/ Esfand of 1363] -Yes, Mehdi? -Where are you, Jamshid? -I'm at the Sadband -What are you doing there? I'm staying here so that the Iraqis can't take the place Leave there! Don't let the guys run away! Why should we stay here? We have no weapon Stop! Have you no shame? -Come back. We don't have any help -I have to stay and save this place. If you send 50 men here, I'll save this place Come back. It's an order I won't answer them as long as they don't send help Go and stand there Don't waste your weapons Go back, Mehdi! They're bombarding us God! I'm burning! Help him Send the guys from Haribeh to Sadband Tanks are coming. Back off! Go! Back off Back off! We almost lost Haribeh. They're reaching here Iraqis have a plan to keep you captive. They listened to our conversations and they know you're here They're here to catch you We stay here. Don't worry. They asked me to tie your hands and send you back with the boat! I can't leave. If we back off, we have to do a lot to get back here We sacrificed a lot. I have to stay and bombard the bridge to cut the road Don't worry. We're here. Be sure of that -Bring the injured. Bring Alireza Tondro -He's in the boat Listen! Pay attention to Haribeh -I go see if I can get any help -OK Mehdi! Come back. Let's see what we can do You have no idea how beautiful this place is. I wish you were here. Can you hear me? I was sitting next to you. Mostafa took me I wish you were here to see this beautiful place, Ahmad. We'd stay together forever Come here and watch if you had time -For God's sake. Come back here -Don't swear, Ahmad. I can't leave my army alone At least tell something to guys I said everything I had to. Tell them whoever loves Mehdi, come here Turn it off Maybe they send help Everything's over Go back. I stay here. Ghanbarloo and Jamshid are here, too -What's your name? -Mohammadreza Lotfi -You're a good man -Thanks, sir -Were you in Kheybar mission, too? -Yes, sir -You ever saw my brother, Hamid? -A couple of times, from a distance -If Hamid was here, we wouldn't be alone -God bless him -Can I ask you a favor? -Of course. Anything Take Ghanbarloo and Jamshid back with this one boat that's left -I'm not leaving you behind -How do you expect me to leave you behind, then? They're walking towards us They're here. Be careful -Where are you going? -To Haribeh. They're shooting Stay here. I'll go -It's dangerous, Mehdi -I said stay -Are they our guys? -I don't know These are Iraqis! Go quickly! Mehdi When will this loneliness end? When will your tiredness end? When will you stay long enough for your clothes to dry? Hamid and Mehdi's bodies haven't been returned home yet Translation by: Zahra Tohidi
