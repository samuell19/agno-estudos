(SEDUCTIVE DANCE MUSIC PLAYING) (THUNDER RUMBLING) Rogers! Just because it's your last day don't mean you can sit on your butt, dreaming. Work! He ain't working. I'm workin'. Where's your hat? I lost it. Hey, last day, huh, Travis? Last day. Rogers! I'm working. (WHISTLE BLOWING) Good luck to you, Travis. Done! (LAUGHING) You're really going to do it? Yeah. You will be sorry. I know what I'm talking about. I've been married three times. Kiss my butt, man. Believe me, they change. I've known this girl my whole life. Have you tried talking to her lately? Well, she is busy now. (CHUCKLES) What are you laughing about? Too busy to talk, huh? Ain't got quite as much time as she used to have? All that talking time is over now, anyway. She has a noose around your neck. You are going down fast. (SCOFFS) (ALL CLAMORING) What the hell? Stephi, I have to talk to you. He cannot see her in her wedding gown! Keep still! Sorry. Watch your feet. Stephi... Darling, I can't talk to you now. (ALL CLAMORING) You want me to go home? No. Stay. Flowers for Stephi Lawrence. Put those beautiful monsters in there. Travis, go bathe. Someone I know? Want a wart on her nose? No. (ALL SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) MAN: Make way for the cake. What are they doing here? Our kitchen burned up. WOMAN: They need a place to ice the cake. Stephi, talk to me! Darling, I can't now. Talk to me. (GLASS BREAKING) Damn it to hell! Oh, my God. What did he break? What did he do? Mother! He tried to walk across his own living room. He broke the Venetian glass serving plate. My God, Bull! Would y'all hush up? It looks better broken. Come here. You choose. You said you wanted lamb. Chicken legs bring good luck. Come here, boy. (WOMEN SCREAMING) More flowers for Stephi Lawrence. Do you want bows on Travis's pumps? He must have bows. Bull, you're not leaving this house. Stephi, five minutes! Travis, can't you see that I am busy? How am I supposed to paint that? Are you having second thoughts about this marriage, boy? Daddy, stop that. Looks like a touch of buyer's remorse. What is that? That is his earring. We have a matched set. Travis has one, I have one. Travis, I love you. Father, we have to make plans for the rehearsal. They sent funeral flowers over here. Call them. The future. I can say it in one word. Manure. Stephi, did you put me with Loomis? My goodness. (ALL CLAMORING) That's all right. Manure is the future energy source of the world. It puts out all those gases. Methane, ethane and all that stuff. You and me are going into the manure business, and corner the market on future energy supplies. Get to Dallas and buy that car you want quick, because I want you back for the Petroleum Club luncheon. You miss that lunch, and I am going to eat your nuts. Daddy. Bull. Quiet. I am talking business over here. Come outside with me. Are you insane? She's in her wedding dress. You get out of here. Son, son. Son, the future is shit. And you and me are in it together. MAN: Come on, boy. (KISSING LOUDLY) Come on. Come on, boy. Easy, now. Easy, now, boy. (NEIGHS) Come on. Nobody likes a noose. Easy does it. Son, you are 20. You are getting married in three days. It's normal to feel a little frightened. Dad, I don't know if I'm ready for this. You're ready. People in California don't get married until they are or 30 or 35. And they get married four or five different times, too. Forget about California people. How many of your friends getting married this summer? Seven. You boys going to get lots of sugar this summer. (LAUGHS) Seems to me that city folks keep their young, too young for too long. You are grown. You will have a good job coming with Bull Lawrence. Now, you deserve a good woman. What else do you want to be? A disco king? No! (BOTH LAUGH) That's it. That's it. Grip him with your knee. There you go. (CLICKING TONGUE) You got it. That's great. You sure are a good looking boy. I just wish you had common sense. Mama... Okay. All right. Here we go, again. I said nothing. Mom, you know I can't work for Dad. It would mean so much to him. I've got too much on my mind right now. I don't want to work with horses. I want to do something else! Get off my back! You really want to work for Bull Lawrence? No. But not here either. You don't have to live here. That's not the point. He loves you so much. And you are so good with horses. (GROANS) Hello, Andrew. This is Bull Lawrence. I'm fine. Thank you. Listen. My new son-in-law is going into business with us. I'm making him a partner. I'm having a luncheon at the Petroleum Club on Friday. I want you to come meet him. Are you packed yet? I'm just going to Dallas. You've never been there. It's a lot different than here. It's not like I'm moving there. Why do you have to go there? Why buy a hot rod? It's not a hot rod. I don't care. You should be thinking about basic transportation. Ford or Chevy. Shut up. Or a pick-up truck. I don't want a truck. How much is it? I only need $5,000 down. Pissing it away... I could use it as collateral. He did earn the money. Now he's throwing it away. You have a wife to take care of. You know how Stephi needs care. Oh, stop that. You'll have house payments. Now car payments, too. What if it breaks down? If it breaks down, you'll be stuck with no way to get to work. Stephi's daddy wouldn't like that. I don't want you asking Bull Lawrence for money help. I'm getting married this Saturday. Don't you think I'm old enough to buy my own car? How do I look? Like a Mafia game show host. She told her mom we are going to have five kids. Does that mean you will finally get laid? Maybe. Maybe not. (ALL LAUGH) Listen, everybody. I've got some important marital advice. Fellatio. Hush. Doing weddings is Walter and my business. I know what makes a marriage last, and what doesn't. Stephi, listen to me. Sorry. We don't do divorces. This is it. People are always saying how different men and women are. Right? (BUZZES) Stop that! Do you want me to just go home? No. I could just go home. No. Stay. All right. Where was I? Men and women. You hear that all men want is sex. All women want is romance. Not true. I've met women stronger than most men. And some men more sensitive than any woman. You want your marriage to last, then remember one thing. What? He ain't no different than you. (SEDUCTIVE DANCE MUSIC PLAYING) (LIGHTNING CRACKING) (THUNDER RUMBLING) Stephi! Shh! Quiet. What do you want? You. Go around. Now! Sweetie, when are you going to grow up? Now we are going to talk. About us. Us? Travis, I know what the matter with you is. You have male prenuptial anxiety attack. What? I read about it in Modern Bride. It will go away. Let me come up there. If I haven't let you up here in 15 years, I am not starting tonight. Then come down here to me. Honey, go to bed. Stephi, I need you. Oh, honey, you are just feeling horny. You'll have me in three days. Can't you wait? Stephi! (LAUGHS) You are so cute. I love you. (MUMBLES) I love you. Travis, I love you. Love you, too. Travis Rogers, please! I love you! So, what's the trouble, bubble? I don't know you, Stephi. Travis, you've known me your whole life. Travis, have you been drinking? Yeah. I knew it. You did? Yes, I did. How did you know? I know you better than anybody in the whole world. You do? Yes, I do. Travis, you go to bed. Good boy. Stephi. I need this car. Then go buy it. Travis. We're going to get married. (ORGAN PLAYING) You may kiss the bride. (SCREAMS) (GASPS) What's this? A money belt. I have a wallet. They have pickpockets. Who are they? Where is Stephi? I thought she was going to be here. Wait. Take this. I have put a couple quarters n there. Call us if you need anything. There's some seltzer tablets and Dr. Phelp's phone number. Mom, these aren't quarters. I put a mini-fold raincoat in there. You never know. Mom, I'm not going to hell. I have a schedule to make, folks. Get a receipt, Son. Call us when you get there. Travis! I love you! Joining the service? No. I'm buying a car. When do we get there? You bought a seat. Sit in it. No, I like this. Pick one. Whoo! We're moving now. I'm Travis Rogers. Frank. I thought I was never going to get out of this town. Where you going, Dorothy? Oz? No. I'm going to Dallas. (CHORAL MUSIC PLAYING) I can't afford this car. Travis, no. Stephi, listen to me. Travis, I can't listen to you. I'm too busy. Stephi, we are going to buy this car. Travis, that is a Lambor-Jeanie. Ghini! It's an imitation Lamborghini. It's a fake. Probably will blow up. Fine. Goodbye. Bye, honey. Trust me. I know what I'm talking about. This car is not as expensive as it looks. I'm going to buy the bare model. No extra frills. And I know all about salesmen. You've got high-end, low-end, you got bluebook price. I'm going to make a deal that nobody will believe. Travis, I know you. You look at that car and your mouth drops open. Some bonehead salesman will make you his friend. You want to buy every option and... I don't want to spend my life living in a trailer eating tuna fish just to pay for some car! Stephi, I know how to handle a bonehead salesman. Pretty, isn't she? Yes. She is a beauty. She runs like a scalded dog. Let me get one of my salespeople to help you. Jonni! Well, I guess we know what we want. Right? I mean, some guys really aren't sure. But you don't look like that. Jonni Tigersmith, sales. But don't hold that against me. (STAMMERS) Uh, Travis Rogers. Come on. You will love this. She is available with four or six turbos. Or no turbo. All kinds of roofs. Lots of hot colors. Midnight blue. Bonzai black. Fire and ice red. It's unbelievable. It is still more car than I planned on, though. It's just that I only have $19,000. With $5,000 down to start. That's it. Money isn't a problem. We have a creative financing plan. I like you. My boss owes me a favor. I'll try and get you a special deal. You mean we're going to make a deal here? Now? We'll talk about money later. Let's go for a test drive. (ENGINE FIRING UP) God, these things are tight. Travis, watch the road while you're driving. I don't usually do this. My boss would kill me. But why don't we go out on the freeway? Get a look at her legs? Coming? Travis, don't get sucked in. I will not get sucked in. No options! I don't want any options. No mag wheels. No 6-liter engine. Want a radio? Can't have one. Travis, we can't afford this car if you buy one option. JONNI: This is the Options Room. You probably want alloy wheels. Or mag wheels? Yeah. This means yes. Yes. Si. Do it. Ha! All right! You have to have an engine, tiger. A 6-liter? Sure. Now, just go crazy. Take whatever you want. It's all yours. All right. (MUTTERING) It's nice. (LAUGHS WILDLY) (ALL CLAMORING) Are you two getting a kickback on all this stuff? No more Wedgewood. Do you want Titian or Oxblood? Titian. Chrome carburetor. Pearl-handled gear shift lever. Extended warranty? That's it. Happy? Yes, I am. Let me talk to my boss and see if I can make a deal. Jonni? Fight for me. That's why they call me the "Tiger." That's why. Hmm. Jewelry. We need earrings. She'll wear her grandmother's earrings. I will not. Those things are ugly. Has he got a trade-in? JONNI: No. It's his first car. Did you get him on the options? He practically broke the computer. Take his $5,000 and get him on the monthlies. He is watching us now. I'll be back. I have to go hand somebody his dick. He wouldn't go for it. Was it fire and ice red you wanted? I got it? (CHEERS) Stephi? I got it. Travis, what are you doing still in Dallas? Dallas? Quiet! Travis, talk to me. You won't believe this car. I don't care. What are you doing? You listen. I spend $120,000 on a car, and I expect it to start. Do I look like I gave birth to the car? Get me the manager. You need major surgery to get management away from their lunch. You go find me one of them dipshits right now, or I'll yank them into court and have their heads circumcised. Travis, are you listening to me? Yeah. I would pay to see that. Travis, the rehearsal dinner is in three hours. Get back here now. Excuse me. I have to wait an hour for my car to be ready. Is there any place to eat? The Burrito Emporium across the street. Nice people there, too. MAN: Woman, let me cook. I will cook for you. You don't want my brother to cook. Okay. If she is going to cook, run away fast. Do you want a Torpedo Burrito or the Tijuana Torpedo? Don't do it, man. I'll have the Tijuana Torpedo burrito. You are crazy, man. Shut up! Do you want more? I can't eat anymore. Six is enough. You are going to die, man. Have one more. Please? Don't do it. I have to get my car now. What's the damage? Your colon. There you are. I thought I lost you. Whoa! This is our 800 number. My home number is on the back. Call me if anything goes wrong. Your home phone number? Go run dry. First mile is for you. I can't believe this! (ENGINE FIRES UP) Ruff, ruff. Well, Dad, I guess your fears were unfounded. Right? Unfounded. (CHANGES VOICE) I knew you could do it, son. Thank you, Mr. President. No, Travis. Because of that, we want you to be Secretary of the World. Thank you. The first thing on the agenda is to turn up the music as loud as possible. (ROCK MUSIC BLARING) (SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) What's up? I love your car. Thank you. Thank you, God. (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) Yes! ♪ Weapons of love ♪ Hurting me ♪ Weapons of love ♪ Killing me (TIRES SQUEAL) (SCREAMS IN PAIN) (MUSIC SPEEDS UP) My tape! What is the matter with this? (GIRLS LAUGHING) Stephi, this is serious. I feel it. I can tell he will be late to the rehearsal dinner. Travis will be here. Within seconds he will be arriving in the driveway. (TRANSMISSION GRINDING) My bones have never lied. They're lying now. We have got a major problem here. Relax. Travis will be here. How are you so sure? I know. Because I have him wrapped around my finger. I thought you wanted a wedding ring wrapped around your finger? No, Dee Dee. Wedding ring goes around the fourth finger. Husband goes around the pinkie. (ALL LAUGH) (MAN SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Goddamned car! Damned car! (GIGGLING) "Within seconds Travis will be arriving in the driveway." "Wrapped around her little finger." Blow it out your ass, Dee Dee. (GASPS) Trash mouth. Stephi, your daddy says we have to leave now. Mr. Rogers? It's raining like a cow pissing on a flat rock. Tonight I have a good place to keep it. This car is very hard to tow. Are you sure it should hang like this? Body is made of plastic, like a Barbie Doll. Even as we speak, Travis is in our beautiful new car, flying home to me, like Romeo to Juliet. That's me. Could you slow down? My whole life is spinning around back there. Ah! Help! Mr. Rogers, relax. It's not going anywhere. Would you get it down? You do your job. I will do mine. Your car is perfectly safe. You're sure? Go home. I can't go home. Why not? Is there a motel or something around here? You are from out of town. Hotel, two blocks that direction. You will be fine. However, I would walk very quickly and don't speak to anyone. Where is he? He will be here, honey. My husband is going to miss my rehearsal dinner. Rehearsal dinner? It's more like a coronation. If there is no wedding, we still get paid. Excuse me, sir. Do you have any rooms? Sir? (RINGS BELL) Hello? Hello? Any rooms? Hey, dumb ass! What are you doing? You got any rooms? This is it. It used to be the elevator engine room. We call it The Top of the Shaft suite. Don't let the bed bugs bite. Jonni. Please be home, Jonni. Chicken, Chicken. Can I help you? Chicken, Chicken? How many pieces would you like? Oh, no. We lost one more. Here he is! I got him. Here he is! He's on the telephone! Are you hurt, angel? No, I'm fine. Then you're dead. Stephi, are you alone? There's something I have to tell you. (CHUCKLES UNCOMFORTABLY) This better be good. Well, I'm still in Dallas. (SHRIEKS) I'm having a small problem with the car. What kind of small problem? Needs a minor readjustment. Are you sure it's not us that needs a minor readjustment? Stephi... Now, Travis. You would tell me if something was the matter, right? Honey, nothing is the matter. Then promise me you will be at Daddy's luncheon tomorrow. I promise. Even if I have to take a bus. Travis... Travis... Honey... What? Remember when you carved our two hearts in that oak tree? Uh-huh. Well, Travis, just think. In exactly 46 hours and 57 minutes, those two hearts will be as one. Uh, Stephi, I have got to go. Travis! Travis! Travis! Travis! Shit. I love you too, angel. Uh-oh. Where am I? What's the trouble, bubble? Stephi, where am I? We are in your tummy, honey. My stomach? Honey, what have you been eating? Tijuana Torpedos. You are going to die, man. I've never seen you like this. Coochie-Coo. (LAUGHS) Stop it! Oh, Travis, I love you, angel. Oh, no! Travis? Travis! Wait. I'm coming. Stephi, I'm coming. Help me! Travis, marry me. No! No! Marry me! Travis, Marry me! Come back. I'm sorry. Stephi! (THUNDER RUMBLING) I must have misdialed. Jonni wouldn't do that to me. Wrong number. Where's that card? Jonni Tigersmith's home. 555-2782. Panic over nothing. Chicken, Chicken. (GROANS) Say what? Man, do you want to order a chicken or not? I think he already had his chicken. Did he like it? (HEAVING ON SPEAKER) That's the man who was here. When are you going to learn how to cook? That was our first customer. Listen to that man. What will he say about us? Shut up. I'm sorry about the way that chicken made you feel. It's our first day. Don't say that! And I think he knows it. Where is Jonni Tigersmith? Open the door. What is your problem? Where's Jonni? Jonni is gone. I've heard that before. Where is she? Whatever she told you, she told me worse. What? I mean, however she screwed you, she screwed me worse. Understand? No. The bitch left last night with two months advance pay and 25 guys like you howling at me. No. That's right. Women. (CHUCKLES) My father told me not to do this. I was miles from here and the seats move forward, the sunroof chops off my hand, the stereo starts vomiting my tapes out. I'm having a good time, the car falls apart. Well, it's not supposed to do that. It did. She said you would help. She shouldn't have. Well, she shouldn't have. Gentlemen, the beautiful part of this process is there is an unlimited supply of raw material. There's one thing we Texans will always produce, and that is manure. Even if we all suddenly turned into vegetarians. We can always stay on top of the pile. Gentlemen, there is no negative side to this. The only thing we ever have to fear is constipation. (ALL LAUGH) I was hoping to introduce my new son-in-law, Travis Rogers, but the little bastard didn't show up. So instead I, Stephi Lawrence, will be speaking in his place. You boys are probably tired of listening to my daddy. I'll tell you something. Stereo replacement for the Macro-acoustic is $360. Covered by the warranty? No. All told, I would say your repair costs are about $3,200. Did I mention the labor cost? That's extra. AUTOMATED VOICE: Welcome, my friend, to the exciting 800 number of the world of Trovare. My name is Guiseppe Roma, your pre-recorded problem solver in the wonderful world of Trovare. As you know, your Trovare is the finest in modern transpiration, designed by master auto builders in Europe. It doesn't work, Guiseppe. But sometimes, even perfection can go wrong. If you believe the challenge you are experiencing is the engine, press number one on the telephone dial. If it is the transmission, press number two. Brakes, number three. And if you don't know what is wrong, in the whole world, press number four. Uh-oh. And please allow Guiseppe to tell you how wise you were to purchase the extended warranty. I didn't buy it. Because, my friend, Guiseppe can only help you if you have the warranty. If you have the factory-only warranty, I am very sad. Because now we must say ciao. (SCREAMING) Mayday! (ALL CLAMORING) Get him! You! I want my money back! You bastard! Get out of here. I tried to be nice. What good does it do to be a nice guy? Back to work, boys. Curious how many cars have broke down since you took over this place. I guess that's why you're here, to fix them. I can't fix a 1957 Chevrolet carburetor in a two-day-old Trovare. Listen, I sell the cars. You keep them running. Or you can get out. One call from me and you'll be in San Quentin, praying you don't drop the soap. That's it! You're fired, buddy! I don't give a shit, dickhead. Get out of here now. You hear me? Grease monkey! You been chopping my cars? And you're next. One way to Wyeth. The bus leaves at 8:06. You have five hours to waste.

Stephi, I will be there. You listen good, boy. You get your butt back here right away, or this wedding is tits up. I love you too, honey. Excuse me. What was that all about? My bride is waiting for me at the altar. I guess I will be your bachelor party. (SULTRY MUSIC PLAYING) (GASPS) Daytime! Would you sit down? Nope. (TELEPHONE RINGS) Hello? Is that Travis? Dad? I have to talk to you. Hello, Leon. Yes, I have the grain reports. They are in the back room. I'll go get them. Damn it to hell. What? I lost another fingernail. One, two, three, they are all going.

(LAUGHING) Listen to me. Don't ever tell your mother, but on the morning of my wedding, I woke up in the bunk with somebody else myself. You did? You think you're the first man to have a bachelor party? No. Get your butt home, boy. You have a good woman waiting for you. Am I going to lose you? Please... You don't like that? Of course I do. I want to tell you something. What? I'm getting married in five hours. That might be a mistake. You think? Ah! How can I think with you doing that? You're not supposed to think. Okay. Think about coming to California with me. California? I can't go to California. Trust me. I tried that once. Try this. Let's go get your car. The way I figure it, our only problem is the woofers. Speakers! Dobermans. Shepards. Four-legged-tail-waggers. Dogs. These aren't nice dogs. These puppies are pissed. So, what do we do?

Listen, young lady, you're not the only one involved. I have known Travis all my life. He'll be here. I've been an oil man my whole life. I know dry holes and the sound of sucking wind. You better call this off. (DOGS GROWLING) Eat shit and die, Toto. (MIMICS BOMB FALLING) Come on, here we go. The jail is open, guys. There is nothing I hate worse than a chopped car.

This is a one-way street. I know that! (LAUGHS) Go back to the shop. What? Watch it! Jesus! Shit. There goes about a million years of bad karma. Kar-ma? Car-ma. (LAUGHS) Hey, Chapman. Looks like all your chickens came home to roost. Help me, goddamn it, call the police! Why don't you call the police? I'd love to talk to them. Get back here! I like the way you drive, boy. I thought we were just going to get my car back. We got it. You destroyed the whole building. No. We just rearranged it. I want you to have this. It isn't worth much. But what is these days? (SIRENS APPROACHING) Listen, leave before the cops come. California. I'll be in Jamaica. So long. (INAUDIBLE) This is insane, Bull. That boy has gone crazy. We should have canceled the whole thing yesterday. Don't look at me! I told you to call it off three days ago. He isn't going to show up, is he? No. Do you think she can handle it? I don't know. Is there something I don't know about? No. Did you have a fight of some kind? No. What was the last thing you talked about? Nothing. He kept... I kept on talking about the wedding. Yeah? And he kept trying to talk to me. About what? (SIGHS) I don't know. I wasn't listening. (ORGAN MUSIC PLAYING) Oh, boy. When I was eight years old, my daddy gave me a pony. But he was too wild to ride, so we had to keep him in the pasture. I went to visit him every day, and I fed him sugar. I couldn't wait for the day when my pony would settle down, and I could ride him, and he would really be all mine. One day, I wasn't paying attention to what I was doing. And I left the gate open, and he got away. I never saw him again. He never came back. Well, it looks like I left the gate open again. Travis tried many times to talk to me, but I wasn't... there. So I have learned that a wedding is not a marriage. Please don't be angry with Travis, because he didn't do anything wrong. I wanted to give him a home, and a family, but I guess that is not what he needs. That's exactly what he needs. I had just about given up on you. Sorry I'm late. What do you think you're doing? Marrying your daughter. And working with my dad. Now, you wait just a minute... Shh... I can't talk now. Dad, I have been thinking... Hit it. (PLAYS ORGAN) (INAUDIBLE) He's all yours. I like this a lot. It's kind of neat. Dearly beloved, we are gathered here in the sight of God, and in the face of this company to join together this man and this woman in holy matrimony. Which is an honorable state, instituted of God, signifying unto us, the mystical union betwixt Christ and his Church. Travis, will you have this woman to be your wedded wife? To live together under God in the holy matrimony? Will you love and comfort her, in sickness and in health and forsake all others and be faithful to her as long as you both shall live? Thank you. That sounds like goodbye. I have to go home now. We could have a good time. We did. Wait. I want to come. To my wedding? I've never been to one before. You may kiss the bride.
