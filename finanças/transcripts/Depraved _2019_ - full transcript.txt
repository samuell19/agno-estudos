And you're just watching this woman this mind just like shut down bit by bit, you know? I know it's hard seeing that. Yeah, but... but then the moment you're back in the, in the singing, she's just like alive again. She starts with these kind of like, these moves. And you know.. I guess she's.. That it's, it's okay. It's very sweet that you visit. You're a good grandson. Well, yeah, she's my nana. You'll be a good dad. And such a good, sweet dad. Lucy, come on, why are you doin' that? I'm... I'm moving in with you. I think... I think that should be enough for right now. Oh, okay, I was just saying, I don't know I thought... I thought you were sweet and I just wanna meet our little Alex or Alexandria. It is just so totally, totally insane that you're talking about having kids when we.. I, I know I get it, I know. I was just.. God, nothing. Just... just think about it for a second. I mean, you work at a museum and I do web design for a company that's downsizing every week. I mean, that's a... that's a great environment to be bringing a kid into. I was... I was just saying that you'd be a good dad. Nobody's bringing any kids into anything. Look, we've been out of college for like ten minutes. Well, look at you now, you're doing the hair thing. Don't start freaking out. I'm not freaking out, I'm fixing my hair. You are so defensive. I.. I was just trying.. God, I don't even know what.. See what you do is, you just, you keep setting me up to become a disappointment, you know? Every time you raise the bar and I can't keep up I have to feel like a fucking asshole. Because you know why? 'Cause it makes me feel like I don't love you enough when I don't want to have kids with you when we're like 23... You're obviously having a total meltdown. Do you just.. You don't wanna do this. No, of course, I wanna do this. But I am gonna go. What, now... now you're mad? I'm not mad, I just.. I have to see nana in the morning and it makes more sense for me to be at my place. I'm sorry to disappoint. Well, aren't you, at least, gonna put this on? It's your birthday present. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on. Happy Birthday. Thanks, babe. It's.. Stay, we don't have to talk about anything anymore. Oh, come on, baby. I'll call you, alright? We got tomorrow. You're awake. You're up. You're... you're... you're up! Oh, okay. Uh, okay. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, uh. Oh, uh, ca... can you say that? Can you say o... okay? Try to say "Okay." Oh, my God! Oh, my God. I had a pulse yesterday. I, uh, I have to name you. Adam? It's so corny. I.. Shit! I can't think. Um.. Adam. Adam. I'm Henry. I'm your.. Uh.. Wait, uh, we need to get a picture.. For you Uncle Polidori. This is where you'll stay! Oh. This is your room. Recover here and become strong. You will stay here. You will not leave until we are ready, you understand? You understand? I want you.. To be safe. And the most important thing for you.. Will be sleep.. So your brain can recover. She started these kind of like, these moves. And, you know.. I guess she's.. That it's, it's okay. It's very sweet that you would say that. - You're a good grandson. - Well, yeah, she's my nana. Alex. It's okay, Adam. It's okay. Let's put these on. So, let's get you checked out, okay, Adam? Open. Close. Now, Adam, you need drugs. Don't worry. Most of America is on drugs. Uh, uppers, downers pain killers, mood enhancers. Blood pressure, diabetes, opioids and meth. Seen it on TV. Somebody is very eager to meet you. Okay, now for you, we have got.. Dilantin for your brain seizures. Uh, Butoxamine, Heparin. Cyclosporine, Mycophenolate pH, beta blockers blood thinners, coagulators.. Mood enhancers, blood pressure, diabetes opioids and meth. Pain killers. Mood enhancers. And, of course.. Polidori's own new and improved magic Rapamycin. "Rap X" he calls it. I give you life.. And he keeps you alive. No, no, no, no, no. The ones that match. Put 'em together. No. The moon, the moon. No, the moon, the moon. Okay. Moon, moon, no. There you go. Put it where it matches. Barn. Barn, fits. See? Barn. No. Barn. Hmm. Barn. No. Barn. Moon. Moon. Barn. Shit! Let's get up. Let's get that taken care of. "When Simon is hiding, where can he be?" "Is he hiding under the Truffula tree?" "No one is sure, no one can say." "Some people think Simon has just run away." "But I know that Simon is hiding quite near. You just have to look, use your eyes and your ear." You like that left side of your brain huh? Let's try this one. What you got to do. What you got to do. What you got to do. What you got to do. "Now Simon is hiding where can he be?" "Is he hiding under the Truffula tree?" "No one is sure, no one can say." "People think Simon has just run away." "But I know that Simon is hiding quite near. You just have to look. Use your eyes and your ear." I wanna meet our little Alex or Alexandria. Eat. First, you are going to do medicine.. And then an experiment. Here we go. Close your eyes. That's it. Adam? Adam? Now, I want you to try the puzzle again. I... I... I know you can do it. You can do it because it's all there. It's still in your head. You can access that information. During the operation, I had about three hours wiring up the brain. It... it was the most complex part and you know you... you lost neurons like if you'd had a stroke or drank too much for a couple of decades. They won't regenerate. But the brain can reroute all those little synapses. They will find another way around. I mean, the plasticity of the brain is fantastic and what better stimulus then self. But regularity leaves impressions and creates a space for the mind to rejuvenate. Look at you go! Adam! Puzzle master! Alright, you heard Bach and then you heard Beethoven and then America came along. America gave us jazz and the blues. Pretty great, right? This.. Is gravity. Gravity makes the ball go down. Gravity also keeps you on the ground. Gravity is your friend. Now you try. Good, again. Gravity. What? Gravity is.. Your friend. My God, yes. Gravity is.. Your friend. Yes! Yes! Gravity is your friend. Yes! Yes! That's it. Say it louder. Gravity is your friend. Gravity is your friend. Yes, say it again. Gravity is your friend. The boy talks! Gravity is your friend. What about dancing? Try dancing. Uh, okay, no. We'll try that later, that's fine. Okay, let it drop. Ping pong. Ping pong. Good. This is your paddle, this is the ball. I'm gonna drop the ball.. And hit it over to you. You hit it back. Good. But, no. Give me the ball. Pick up the paddle. Hit the ball to you you hit it with the paddle, okay? Let's try again. Good! Come on, man, you got to hit it back. Fuck! I'm sorry, I'm not mad at you, alright? I'm just mad at myself. Mad at myself. Mad at myself. Mad at myself. Henry is hiding. If Simon is hiding where can he be? Hiding under the Truffula tree. Sure and steady. You'll be a good dad. And such a good, sweet dad. And such a good, sweet dad. Adam. Hope you're not wandering around at night. Sleep is very important. No, he's not ready to be shown, alright? I'm still worried about regression. The, the brain may be immunologically privileged but the rest of his body is just a battle ground of tissues aching to go at it. Yes, I am just being cautious. If there's even a whiff of rejection and inflammation the whole protocol will be called into question. Well, they should be concerned if they're legit. So, I want to be sure. I'm not sad you're away. Thank God you're away. He wouldn't last a week with your hyped up energy around here. He's recovering, you understand? He's not some junk bond you can just flip. Okay. Okay, bye. That was your Uncle Polidori on the phone. He's very eager to meet you. Just come out here, let me get a look at you. That's good. You look good. There's one thing though, you see these buttons how they're uneven? Fix that. Yeah! But see, dude, you forgot to shave your lip. Good job, buddy. I bet you think.. Your name is Adam because of.. The Bible. Adam and Eve first man, all that crap. Or maybe you.. Don't even remember what the Bible is. Yeah, I have been busy. Well, I work at the clinic a couple days a week. Yes, I've been taking my medications. I feel better. I wanna see you too, but you know I'm at the clinic. Polidori's got me on this project. Jesus! Let me call you back, Liz. Don't sneak up on me like that. Turn that fuckin' thing off! Here. Woo Hoo! That's my boy! Adam, now there you are. Hiding, huh? I hope you're hungry. I'm sorry that I was away today. I, uh.. I don't know, I guess I'm.. Not used to any of this. Does that hurt? Why don't I remember? Remember what? Why don't I remember being small? Huh, don't you? Well, you had a trauma. That's what we're dealing with. If your brain could remember. I do remember. What? A face. Really? Well.. The brain plays.. Lots of tricks, Adam. I had.. A certain kinda brain when I was young. And I remembered a lot. And I went to medical school. And I kicked ass. And then I went to the Middle East and... I got my ass kicked. They say... that I saved a lot of people.. While I was down range. I don't remember it that way. I remember all the ones that I lost. You'll be okay. I got you, okay? Hang on! Got me to thinkin', bein' out there all that carnage, body parts. I did some things that would.. Get you in a lot of trouble. But after I got back.. I, uh, I told Polidori about them. I don't know why. Old friend, I guess. Anyway.. Now here we are. Hello! Henry? Henry? Um, sorry to barge in. Are you a friend of Henry's? Is Henry here? Are you where Henry's been all this time? Are you from the war? Um, try this on. Henry's easily jealous. Just.. Yup. So, I am Liz. I'm Henry's... girlfriend for lack of a better word. Who are you? I'm Adam. Are you alright? - Liz. - Henry. What are you doing here? How... how did you get in? I still have keys. Right, of course. I just.. Sorry, you sounded so down on the phone I was worried. I've been worried this whole time. Well, Adam, go to your room! Put clothes on! Liz, I told you I needed some time. I gave you time, I thought you went to the VA Hospital in Washington to try the program there. No, alright? I never left, I've been here. Polidori's just letting you stay here? Why? I'm not one of your patients, Liz. The fact that you won't acknowledge you have a problem is part of PTSD, Henry. I don't have PTSD. I've just been focused on other things. Anyway, in case you think I'm stalking you I'm here because Polidori invited me. Has he even told you, he's been tweeting about some pet project of yours. What's he talking about? Jesus! He's a fuckin' idiot! He doesn't know what he's doing, I told him I need more time. He can't rush this. Rush what? Are you telling me you went through with it? Yes. Oh, my God. You did it. You shit! I'm so sorry I scared you. You must be so.. Alone. Alright, Liz, we have to go now. Goodbye, Adam. Henry, you brought the war home with you. I've been away all month, it's been excruciating. Like missing the birth of your own child. How would you know? Shut up, Georgie. Henry's been secretive. I'm pissed. I think we can all agree it's astonishing what a couple of years in the theater of war can do to a man's medical prowess. And his psyche. Well, we were able to get fatalities down with the mobile triage unit when we were closer to the action. Faster response times, better results. Yeah, but anybody can think about this stuff. You actually did something about it. You got skills. I mean, shit, man, you can bring people back from the dead. And I can keep them alive. I'm sure the girls don't want to talk about this stuff, Polidori. Now, it's too late for that. He won't shut up about it. That's why we're here, right? To bear witness, while others are out fucking around with molecular science.. DNA in Petri dishes or computers. We're in here dealing with blood and guts. The totally tactile. The extreme sports of biology. Both of you are going to end up on the front page. You're damn straight we are. And when we do, I've got a whole speech worked out. Once people see this, we can put Rap-X on the fast track to market. It's gonna save a lot of lives. It should make some SynTech stock holders pretty happy. You and Georgina should do very well. Either that or you'll drive the whole company down in scandal. No. This is way too big for that. Well, Henry, here we are our witnesses to the unavailing. Reality check. We've got a lot riding on this. I've got a lot of very important people interested in what we're doing here. Well, I would really rather be doing this in private. He's never met more than one person at a time. Come on, don't be such a counter-parent. Adam, how did you.. My God! Oh, my God! Well, so, this is it. Or this is Adam. Adam, how are you? How is he? He's good, uh, you know, keepin' him busy with, uh, the Dilantin the Taxamine, Heparin. Cyclosporine, Mycophenolate. Just trying to keep the rejection to a minimum. Quite a cocktail and you've been using the Rap X three times a day? - Three a day. - And all of him functions? Like he, he eats? He shits? Yes, yes and yes. And every single part of him works? What do you mean? You know, cock and balls, Henry. This guy's got to be raging into puberty any day now. You don't want to give him a complex. Oh, I'm sure you'll be happy to counsel him through. Anything for science. - And can he talk? - Yes. Uh, talking is something we've been working on. Isn't that right, Adam? That's right, Henry. And I think we are getting so much better... all the time. That can't happen again. We're doing this on my schedule. Do you understand? Come on. - Book. - No, sleep. You'll fall asleep. Sleep. I'm taking the girls away. They're extremely agitated. Well, you shouldn't have brought 'em in the first place. Yeah, I'll take 'em in town for a drink. You can't buy off Liz. You can buy off anyone, Henry. Come on, I want to see Adam again. Bring him out here. I gave him a sedative, he's all hyped up. The Rap-X is potent. The Rap X is working perfectly and it's gonna save a lot of lives. I mean, that's why we did this, Henry. We did it to make up for everything that went wrong on the battlefield. And, yeah, s... sure we did it to test out a drug that would otherwise take you years to get approval on. But they can't argue with success. Yeah. What the fuck is the matter with you, man? Why aren't you ecstatic? I guess, I.. I got so wrapped up in the challenge of it I didn't think about him. The thrill of conception and now you've all of a sudden lost interest. Maybe you're not cut out for fatherhood. That's not true. I... I've spent time with him. We've bonded. We.. Jesus Christ, I'm fucking with you, man. No, you're, you're a great daddy. But where do we go from here? The experiment's over. Dude, what are you talking about the experiment's over? The experiment has just begun. Now we have to present him to the world. That's the whole point. I'm thinkin' about stoppin' the medication. Are you fucking crazy? Well, excuse me. You are fucking crazy. No, Henry.. That is not what we're going to do. - Adam, you should be in bed. - Adam, it's okay. Come on in, please. You're welcome. It's nice to see you again. Oh, I don't think I ever taught him to shake hands. Alright. Right there. Okay.. Oh, okay. Okay, yep. Big strong hands. Alright, that's.. I see you've got him on hormones. HGH. I wanna see how strong he can get. You know, with everything else he's got goin' on. - And? - See for yourself. Hm. You know I think you should let me take him out for a spin. Give him some air, some culture. You're always talking about the importance of the brain. Do you think we should be filling this one with something worthwhile? I want him back by 6:00, before dark. Look at you. You're so cute. You're a prick. Maybe so, but you got to let go sometime. Come on, Adam. It's gonna be fun. That looks good on you. Don't worry. Come on. Let's take a selfie. Why so serious? Come on, smile. Welcome to Manhattan, Adam. Okay. Come on. Recognize this place, Adam? I believe you should. Come on. And so it begins. I don't suppose Henry's had the time to teach you the history of things but allow me to summarize. Since the beginning it's been war and warring with factions of artists trying to find beauty and meaning. Capture the agony and the ecstasy. This museum, it's a mausoleum to the aspirations of man. Nice aspirations on him, don't you think, Adam? "The Divine Comedy." Should Ugolino have eaten his offspring? It's all about choices. Some would say choice is an illusion. I prefer to give it some credit. The choices we make define the man. Come on. The Rape of the Sabine Women. I thought you'd like this one, Adam. Filled with an action. Those women were tricked and can't be trusted. Terrible. Principles, justice, honor. Some would die for them. While others are a bit more shrewd. This, this is what they teach you in the institutes of higher learning, Adam. A lot of useless knowledge that nobody gives a fuck about anymore. I did meet my darling wife in college. Don't get me wrong, there are some perks. She was very rich. C... cloud. Hm... yes, it is. How do you see the world, Adam? Do you see great swirls like Van Gogh? He died in poverty. He went mad and cut his own ear off. Modernity encroaches. 20th century angst. God is dead and we are left alone with our technology and our nightmares. It is the beginning of the end. A culture of narcissism and self indulgence born out of the comforts of modern life. All that's left to do is enjoy the ride. This is my favorite place in the museum. Here we have artistry and science directly engaged with man's essential impulse.. Violence. These are instruments of death. Look how lovingly crafted. From the blade to the balm humanity does so love destruction. Depraved. That's what we are, Adam. Utterly depraved. Souvenir of our visit. You always have to have a souvenir, Adam. Speaking of memories, does, um anything here look familiar? Have you worked here long? Um, for a while, yeah. Thanks. Thank you. Come on, Adam. It's not polite to stare. Hi, ladies. Melania. Ermez. Hi, baby. Get us two whiskeys. Come on, Adam. This is my friend, Adam. Adam, this is the lovely Stormi. Thank you, my love. Salut. Don't worry, it gets better with the second one. You like her? You do like her, don't you? Do you know any girls, Adam? I know Liz. You do know Liz. Let's get closer. Give those to her. Mm-hm. We're gonna spend a lot more time together, you and I, Adam. Henry's not well. There is one thing I want you to promise me. If he ever stops giving you your medication you know, the... the... the Rap-X? It's the little red pills? You find them and you take them. Three tablets a day and you never stop. Do you understand? Good. He may not care about you.. But I do. That's the funny thing about fathers. So few of 'em are in it for the long haul. Do you know what a lie is, Adam? A lie is something that's spoken that is not true. A lie can hurt as much as a knife wound if it's wielded with as much care and purpose. Sometimes it's those who are closest to us who lie. You like her. Good morning, Henry. Come on, Adam. Attaboy. Where the hell were you? We were out on the town. All night? Never again. You know, I must've been out of my fuckin' mind. Yeah, sometimes I think you might be. - What did you give him? - Ah, don't worry about it. He'll sweat it out. Don't be such a fuckin' Puritan. I called you seven times. Yeah, well now you know what it feels like. - This isn't a fuckin' game! - No, I understand that. Hey, listen I... I... I just wanna tell you something because he's your patient. What, what? What do you wanna say? Well, it's just, uh.. I think he might be a little volatile. Some of his behavior was slightly erratic. Yeah, he's probably reacting to whatever the fuck you put him through. You and your whole scene, man, just lookin' for excitement. You don't know the first fuckin' thing about excitement. Look, he said something about Liz.. So I figured maybe you should keep an eye out. - What? - Nothing. Nothing, it was just the fact that it came so fucking out of the blue. I thought you should know. Ask him. Look, I got to go. Come on, let's go inside. Hello. It's me, Liz. I remember. I'm Adam. Um, did I wake you? Um, I wanted to know.. How you... feel. Feel? I.. I feel with my hand. Buttons. Oh, mm. I, uh.. I was wondering.. Is any... body asking you.. Do you have any.. Pain? Pain? Pain. Yes. I have pain. Oh. What do you do here all day when Henry's not around? I read books. I wait for Henry to come and play ping pong with me. In my... dreams, um I'm someone else. I don't understand how I got here. What's goin' on here? Henry. Liz, you can't just keep barging in here. Well, he was all alone. You're not gonna fix him. You're not gonna fix me. Jesus Christ, Henry, what a fucking mess you've made. Don't talk to me like that. What I've done here is amazing. Oh, really? And who can you tell about this spectacular accomplishment without being thrown in jail? Fuck that! You don't think that they would fall all over themselves to protect me after they found out what I've done? They? They, they. Who the fuck is they? Who can you even trust with this? My God, shut up. Shut the fuck... Can you repeat what you've done? - What? - Is it verifiable? - It's in the computer. - Would anybody even let you? - Stop! - Henry, you are not well. Ever since I've met you you have been trying to save everyone that you meet but you know what? Therapy and kindness can't fix everything. Alright? You get your fuckin' leg blown off you need more than a bedside manner to fix it! It takes innovation. Blood and guts, innovation. This is not you talking. This is Polidori manipulating you. Stop! You have always been jealous of him, it's ridiculous. Jealous? Jealous that he can get you to do anything he wants. What about me, huh? What about what I have done? What I have achieved? I see nothing here but sadness. Don't, don't say that in front of Adam. Henry, please. Please, just come to the clinic. There are so many vets down there who could use your compassion, your smarts. Yes, of course. I want to but.. If you think that Polidori cares about you or about Adam or anybody but himself, you're wrong. Get out now, please. This isn't needed here. I've been wrong. I realize that.. I owe you something like a normal life.. Where you can come and go. I didn't think it through. I didn't believe that you would ever.. Understand what was happening to you. Maybe I didn't want to. I want a girl like you have a girl. - What? - Lonely. Right, of course. I understand. Is that what you and Liz were talkin' about? No. You don't have to lie to me, Adam. I know that she's.. She's very kind. Lie. It's only a matter of time till we all have to start getting ready for doomsday, you know? Even if it's trans-misogyny the qualifications require.. Valentine's Day may be over but you can always give a smoochy cake.. Northern and Southern California still dealing with the, the fire storms. I'm opposed to shutting down your speech. You know you have to have that objection.. It's not the solution, the government is the problem. Now in this.. Can Bill and Margo win the $10,000? Ask your doctor if Doraphine is right for you. Side effects include bleeding, nausea and in some patients. Doraphine has been known to cause heart failure and death. Discontinue use.. Drugs. Medicine. Don't need 'em. We don't need them... anymore. You, uh... you got better. Red pills. Three a day. Nope. You're good. Adam, I wanna give you somethin'. I want you to have this. And I want you to know.. That charm.. That means this was a gift. That means you were loved. Hit the ball to you, hit it with the paddle. Okay? Okay, let's see if this works. Okay. Open the goddamn door. Where did you get him? Paramedic buddy of mine in Dumbo gave me a call, knew I was looking. God, it's still warm. How did you do that? Henry? Door. Time of death, 10:48. Oh, Jesus. I'm gonna start prepping the instruments. We got to get that brain outta there, alright? Henry? Okay, stay there. Stay there, alright? Alright, stay there. And my best friend. This guy. Okay. Hello? Alex? Alex? Who is this? Oh, my God, who is this? No! Whoa! Whoa-oh! - Speak of the devil! - Adam, stand back. Okay, Henry, in... introduce your friend to the guys. This is proof that Rap-X works. Adam.. - I know what you did. - What? - And you! - Okay, come on! Come on, come on! Adam! Adam! Adam! Guys, I'm so glad you could come. Look, the one thing I need you to understand about all of this is that, is that it's an anomaly. This was not a situation that has happened before. I'm sure you understand that in the course of a clinical trial every so often you hit a... Look, I don't know what the hell happened back there but you're crazy if you think it's ready. Okay, guys, look, I'll, I'll give you a call next.. Well? I couldn't find him but he, he can't have gotten far. Fuck! Henry, I am sorry, I've got too much riding on this. I cannot let you fuck it up. Do you ever get tired of stating the obvious you asshole? It's all ready fucked up! No, no, in fact the only thing that's gone wrong so far is that you've introduced unnecessary drama into this situation. Look, you haven't been firm with Adam and that has made him feel unsafe and uncomfortable. You don't know the first fuckin' thing about what Adam needs. He needs calm and stability. The brain cannot heal itself in an erratic environment. Okay, okay. Well you know what I fucking need, Henry? I need this thing to start paying off... now. This is a trial period still. - No! - You need to accept that. No! It's not, Henry! It's not a trial period. It has been 30 goddamn days. The trial is a rousing success, man. It worked. Congratulations. Look, I got to go. Just so you know, I... I... I took the laptop and the hard drives. What? John, you can't just do that. I'm sure you remember the agreement we made where this is all my property. Come on, man, don't turn this whole fuckin' experience into just some thing you did for SynTech. Oh. Fuck you. Look, I... I was there, man. I was in the room. You needed my help. You didn't do this without me. You couldn't do this without me. Yes, yes, John. We did this together. Look just call me if Adam shows back up. Okay? I... I got to go, uh.. Sort shit out with the suits. And I got to be upstate for the weekend but after that... - Adam is not ready. - Look, Adam's not even here. Look, I'll be back on Monday. He better fucking be back before then. John. John! John! Liz, it's me. I.. Adam's gone missing. I'm out looking for him. But... if he goes back to the loft could you just be there? I'm... I'm sorry. Just call me. Hey, bud? You havin' a drink or what? Whiskey. Top shelf, house, rocks? Yes. Eight bucks. Hey, Sam, I'll get the next one. Hi. You fucked up? You look fucked up. But I wanted to buy you a whiskey 'cause when you walked in here you reminded me of Iggy Pop. You know who Iggy Pop is? Because that's the shit, man. Here, you gonna drink this? Come on, toast. Raise your glass, man. I'm Shelley. - What's your name? - Iggy. Just so you know I've done every puzzle in this place already so... don't try any funny business. So what happened to you? I mean, Iggy, those are a lot of scars. Is that your real name? I like music. Cool. I do too. What kinda music you into? Do you like "The Stooges?" Gravity is your friend. Yeah. Never thought about it like that. So you gonna tell me what happened to you? You don't have to answer that but I really want you to. You have a tattoo. I have a tattoo. Oh, yeah? Yeah, I've got a lot of tattoos. But you're not gonna see 'em all tonight. I have this tattoo. Wow. Wait, what is that? That's, um, Caduceus, right? - It means like rebirth? - I don't know. - You don't know? - I don't know. Oh, come on, you don't know what it means? - No. - Oh. I've had nights like that too. Thank God, I never got a tattoo though. But what about the scars, Iggy? Are you into like scarring and shit? I mean, that's some crazy shit. Okay, what do you say, one more round? Alright, that's it, I'm broke. Sam's so cheap. He won't give me a free one unless I'm here the whole night. Did you just.. So you're good at puzzles. And you're pretty quiet. You're pretty weird. What are you even doing around here? I walked here. Yeah? You live around here? I mean, I've never seen you before, I'd remember. I don't go outside, I stay inside. Mm, hm, no wonder, I mean, you're so pale. I mean... what are you, like a vampire or something? I don't know. Oh, well, that probably means you are one. Shit. It's getting pretty late, huh? I got to work tomorrow. Fuckin' corporate slog. I know you wouldn't guess it by looking at me, huh? But, yeah, just a cog in the wheel. What are you gonna do? Problem is, I can't ever sleep at night so I got to come here every night and slam a couple. - You know what I mean? - Yep. Wow, you are pretty funny. What do you do? Play ping-pong. You're drunk. Or... you're just nuts. I don't know, but I'm pretty drunk. Ooh, yeah, I got to go. You gonna stay? I have nowhere to go. What? I thought you said you lived around here. No. Huh. Well, I guess you can walk me home. I did buy you all those drinks. Whoo, it's so cold! I live this way a lotta blocks. Man... you are really out there. - Are you high? - I like you. Yeah? That's cute, I guess. You can walk me home, I guess. You wanna hold my hand? Weird. I can't believe it rained and then now it's just freezing cold and there's no snow. Rain's only worth rain if it's gonna turn into snow you know what I mean? Anyway, this is me. Thanks for walkin' me. - Uh, come this way. - You live down there? I thought it was just a bunch of warehouses down there. Anyway, I can't, I got to go home. - Come, ping pong. - Oh, yeah, ping pong. - Not tonight. I got to go home. - No, come! - Meet Henry. - Hey! Hey, Iggy, what are you doing? Or whatever your name.. - Come! Come! - What are you doing? Come on! Please! Let me go! Please! Adam? Adam? Adam, oh, my God, what did you do? Come on, we have to get her upstairs. Up... upstairs now! Hold her. Come on. Lay her out! Shelley? Shelley? No, no. It's... it's too late. I want her to be my girl. Give her medicine. - Did you do this? - Shelley, my girl! No, No! Don't you fucking get it? She's been dead for hours. I.. It doesn't work. Medicine! Bring her back like me! - No, I can't! It's too late. - Shelley! I know you can fix her! You know what's happening? You don't really exist. There's no record of you. There's no prints. You're nothing that can be traced to anything. You understand me? You're not in the system. You're not real. I'm sorry. It's over. We can tomorrow. We still got tomorrow. We got tomorrow. We got tomorrow. Shoot! You're gonna be okay, alright? I brought you back. - What's your name? - Adam. Alright, Adam. You're gonna be okay. I got you, okay? Hang on. Come on! Oh, God, Henry, what's happened? I just got your messages. I got to get outta here. Oh, my God. What have you done to Adam? - Who is she? - I... I... I... don't know. I don't know where he went or who he talked to or or, or if anyone's gonna be looking for her. I'm gonna bury him in Polidori's backyard. Then he and Adam can be together. Just how he wants it. Wow, what a fucking mess you've made. Why didn't I remember? Remember what? Why don't I remember being small? Well, you had a trauma. That's what we're dealin' with. I'm gonna drive north and I'll call you when I can. Shit. You... you... you can't drive, you can't even stand. No! I will drive. I will drive. You get in the car. Drop me off at the train and then you're on your own. Oh, my God. When you're in the field, every kid that comes in with his arm blown off or his head smashed in you want to help him. Give him an arm and a new leg. You wish you could bring them all back and send them home to their wives. Their... their moms, their kids. Well, I figured it out. I figured out how to bring them back. Adam. I told Polidori what I'd been doing in the battlefield and he got very excited and he set me up in a loft. He told me people from SynTech would support me. He could supply the pharmaceuticals if I incorporated the Rap-X. He said he could supply the body parts too donated to Sanford Medical and I figured that that was probably legit 'cause he's been on staff there for years, you know? But I... I didn't care. I wanted the body parts. - Sorry. - Oh, my God, I'm so sorry. Oh, my God! - What the fuck is that? - Just dump it. I feel sick, thinking about that girl. Her parents and her friends wondering what happened to her. Wait there! I'll bring it. Alright, that's it. It's about a half mile up to the house. If he ever fucks with me.. I'll just tell him to take a look down here. It's a good piece of meat. Is it dry? Might be a bit dry. Hm. No, mine is fantastic. How 'bout yours, Mr. Beaufort? How was it? It was fine, John. Maybe a bit overcooked. So, I hear tell that we're thinking about raising the price of Doraphine. We're looking into it. It was severely under priced when we introduced it. It's a proportionate adjustment. Shouldn't cause much of a stir. No, it shouldn't, it's, it's astonishing how people think that R and D is free. Hm, that's why I've been doing so much of my my own due diligence on Rap X. Your preoccupation with Rap X is misplaced. It's a long way from market and the application is obscure. I'd like to see you put your focus elsewhere. Sure, but that... that could change with the right data. Correct? Dad, you're not here to just go on about SynTech business over dinner. John brought it up. Uh, we should put coffee on if we're going to do the drive back to the city after dinner. Oh, well, let me get dessert. - Uh, no need for dessert, dear. - Oh, no, I got it... Uh, uh, just coffee and we'll be fine. Are you sure you won't spend the night, mother? It'll be much more pleasant. Yes, we'll have brandy. How fast can you pour, John? Coming right up. Who is that? Having company at this hour? I don't know who that could be. Henry. Liz. What are you doing here? Hey. Hope we're not interrupting. Henry. Liz. This is a surprise. Well, we were in the neighborhood. Apparently. You must be freezing. - Who is it? - Uh, daddy, you remember Henry. - We went to school together. - Yes, Henry. I remember. You went to the Mid East didn't you? Triage, couple of medals? - Yes. - It's a damn mess over there. - Yes, sir, it is. - And not getting any better. Let's not start, daddy. Come inside. You too, Liz. Come in. Thanks, Georgie. What the fuck are you doing here? Where's Adam? He never came back. Wha... what? What.. What do you mean he never came back? Where'd he go? - I thought you'd might know. - Why the hell would I know? I'm waiting for that drink, John. Yeah, I'm coming. No, thanks. Your name is Liz. I don't remember you. You were in the same class as Georgina? Yes, John and Henry too. Um, we were all there at the same time. Huh. You look younger. What do you mean you can't find him? What are you going on about, John? No, I.. There's someone that, uh, Henry and I actually wanted you to meet, but... - And he's gone missing? - Yes. Yes, he has. Shouldn't you be back at the loft in case he shows up? - He won't. - What are you talking about? That reminds me, have you been able to unload that Gowanus property? Where the fuck could he have gone? Such compassion. It's touching. I don't know what's taking so long, a loft like that. You might just have to clear out all that junk. Anton, it's time to go. I don't want to leave in the middle of the storm. Mother, are you sure you won't stay? No, we're leaving, I just wanted my drink. You ready? Okay, uh, Mr. Beaufort if I could maybe come into the office on Monday I'd love to fill you in on the work we've been doing. John, don't bother. "We," who? A... a... anyway, we... we've got to be going. - May I use your bathroom? - There's one in the hall. - You've been here before. - Um, goodnight! It was nice to meet you again. I'm sorry, I don't remember you, dear. The roads are gonna be a fright. Well, talk to your father. He insists on waking up in his own bed. Dad, you should think about staying the night. We'll be fine. We'll beat the storm. Georgina, can you turn the lights on out there? Yes. The coast is clear. Goodnight. Thanks for supper. - Goodnight dad. - Goodnight, dear. Goodbye, Henry. I remember you were very ambitious in school. You have your own practice now? Henry and I have been working on a project that I think might interest you. Just be careful who you get mixed up with. I told my daughter the same thing. - Dear, let's go. - Goodnight. Goodnight. Oh, it's already coming down out there. It's gonna take us forever to get home. Calm down. We'll be fine. - Do you have the keys? - Yes, I have the keys. Bye! I'm gonna go clear the plates. You two amuse yourselves. I can't believe you left him in the city. It's unbelievable. - Yes! - Find what you're looking for? Oh! This is Henry's laptop. Did you know that - Know what? That John would steal something? That he would lie about it? It takes more than that to surprise me. Well, this is Henry's and we came to get it back. Why are you getting yourself mixed up in all of this? Maybe I'm tired of seeing John take advantage of Henry. My husband has invested I dare say everything in whatever it is that Henry is doing and he owns it. And Henry will profit from it in one way or another and you need to get over it and stop interfering. Jesus, Georgie you haven't changed one bit which is understandable considering who your parents are. I know, you'll always be the good girl thriving on lost causes. Shouldn't you be saving souls in the VA right now? What's the point if SynTech has one pill that can take care of all of them if they can afford it? Oh, good Lord. When Henry came back he wanted everything to be the way it was at school, with John as his enabler. Whatever it is they're up to now maybe it will make a difference. Maybe being the operative word, but there's also maybe not. And either way, all I see is death and sadness because of what they've done. Oh, God, such melodrama. You want melodrama? How's this. What the fuck's going on? Are you insane? What the fuck did you do.. What the.. What's she doing? - It's over, man. It's over. - What's over? - What's over? - He's gone. - Who's, who's gone? - Adam is dead. We killed him. You said he left and he didn't come back. Well, he did come back carrying a dead girl. You were right, he's volatile. No, I... I... I just, I only said that to turn you against him. Well, anyway, he's dead now. Alright? He's gone and buried along with everything else. No one will find the evidence, this was all just a bad dream. Uh, we have to clean out the loft. It's done. Henry, take me to the station. I... I need to get out of here right now. I need to get on a train. We don't do trains this side of the river. Alright, a bus. Not at this hour. There's a guest room upstairs. Well, we should go now. No, fuck that. Stay one more night. For fuck's sake, you're our oldest friends. Just, just stay and have have one drink with me. Memorialize Adam to celebrate the work that we did. I'm going to bed. Liz, if you're sensible, you will too. The guest room is at the top of the stairs to the left. Henry, I can drive. We can stay the night. We'll leave first thing in the morning. Alright, alright. Just don't be up late. You've already drunk enough. It's like school all over again. All of us together. Fucking Liz, man. Jesus Christ, when did she become such a champ? Ha-ha! Next time, Henry, we'll do it legitimately. I'll give you a lab, a nice white lab and a nice white lab coat and medical cadavers. Because goddamn, man, we need to do something about the emotional baggage that we had last time because if I looked back and I think if you looked back in hindsight that was really where we went off the tracks, 'cause it certainly wasn't you as a scientist. I mean, scientifically speaking as a medical doctor, you're beyond reproach. I don't know if you're quite the daddy that you thought you were, but, but a brilliant doctor, Henry. Nobody questions that. And I am your Igor. Because what did I do? I got you bodies. I even got you a fresh brain. I want some kind of credit for that but, of course, I did it. I did it for you, man. Because I love you. Doctor. Doctor Henry Frankenstein. Henry, not Victor just like in the movie. I salute you. Frankenstein of the Hudson. No! What did you do to her? Listen, listen, Adam, Liz is your friend, alright? Just let her go. I love you, Liz. I love you. No! You're supposed to be dead. I buried you. You want revenge? Go after Polidori. He made you what you are, he killed who you were. It was you! It was you who made me what I am! What are you gonna do, shoot me? Look at what you've done. You're despicable. - Shut up. - My father was right about you. I'm calling the police. No, you're not. Henry? Henry, is that you? Show yourself! Come on, Henry! Take your time! We can draw this out. I don't think the odds are in your favor though. Henry, I don't think that the war prepared you for actual combat. Not real combat between men. No. For that you need a hunter's instinct. Come out, come out wherever you are. Let's make this more interesting. And where did you go? Come out, come out. Oh, there you are. You do look perturbed, Henry. Whatever made you kill your girl? I mean, you know, look, I'm not I'm not blaming you for it. Who can take it after a while, right? Stop. I will shoot you, I will kill you. I've done it before. Where the fuck do you think those bodies came from? Adam! I thought you were fucking dead. What are you two up to, Henry? No, no, no, Henry! Henry! Please. Please, please, please, please, don't leave me. I'm sorry, Adam. I'm sorry. You can forgive me. I have no one. Yeah, well companionship is overrated anyway. Tell me somewhere in that pea sized brain of yours you remember. That night? Tell me you remember that night, huh? Alex? You.. We gave you life. We gave you opportunity. And what did you do with it? You fucking squandered it. Huh? Whose fucking fault is that? And, now, look. Everybody's dead. I want you to listen to me. This is the way it's gonna go. You were the crazy creation of a mad scientist who went berserk and did all of this. They're gonna blame you for everything. Okay? And they're... they're gonna blame you they're gonna blame you for the bodies for the fire, for all of it. You fucking understand that? Oh, my God. You're still so thick. Goodbye, Adam. I came into this world filled with wonder. I didn't know how I'd come to be. No! No, no, no, help. There's been a break-in in my farm! It's uh, On the High bridge Road. It's about two... I turn to people around me to ask for help in making my way. But now I know that each was only thinking of themselves. They made mistakes. I became just like them. Adam! Stop. Please! You... you have no one. I'll... I'll... I'll take care of you. I'll take care of you! No! No! Gravity is your friend. And now they hate me. And now they hunt me. I will hide and disappear and learn not to care. This is what they have taught me. Come on, we've got this motherfucker! Don't let him get away! Stop! Stop or we'll fire! Stop! Hey, I just splurged. Double cap. What's up? I don't know. This really creepy looking guy left it for you. He just walked out. Wait, he wa... he was here? Where'd he go? He just walked out.
