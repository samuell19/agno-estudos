BLUE. This is our best product. Rahul, if you want to invest in something, then invest in this. But Ustaad, these don't look worth the price you are asking for... That is why you're investing in them. If you don't try doing new things, how will you grow and flourish? You have to think about the future. Who has seen the future? Come. Where? I'll show you the future. Hm. I want detailed accounts daily. Not in two days or even one and half days. It will happen. Bubai da? Oyeee Shontu! How are you, my brother? Good. Bubai Da I have an exam this week... Bubai! Wait, I'm in heavy demand today. Yes Shontu? Bubai da I have a very important exam this week... If I could just get some Blue. What do you mean some Blue? You'll get all of it! This Blue is made for you students only. To help you to study. Is it helping? And how Bubai da! Just one helps me to go all night. Full 100% concentration. Last midterm I scored 98% thanks to Blue... Here, take. - Thank you. That will be 1500, my friend. I don't have that much. How much? 300. 300? Do you have a mobile? Cool, take a photo and leave. Bubai da, please, bubai da... That is all you get for this. This isn't some vegetable market-- 'Is this some vegetable market to bargai - Ustaad? What is happening here? Bubai da, please. I swear it's a very important exam. I'll die if I fail. Please, bubai da. Okay Shontu. I'll give this to you free if you do what I tell you to do. What? Oh dada listen. See that man. Just go and slap him and take this Blue for free. I don't understand. Shontu you're wasting my time. There's nothing to understand. If you slap you pass, if you don't, you fail. Oh dada, you can go. Dada! Wait. I'll do it. Hey! What happened? Why are you hitting me? Why are you hitting me?! Go run! See? Kids these days! They don't even listen to their parents. But, they'll do anything for Blue. Your reward my soldier. Thank you Bubai da. Enjoy! Sit. Hmm... So it's a big day today, hm? That's what everybody is saying but... But, you still can't remember anything, right? But you do remember your name? I didn't at first. But all of you kept calling me Bob so... Here... Sign this. Bob Biswas. Just think! You had such a bad accident. You were in a coma for eight years! But still, you came back! Don't worry, your memory will also start coming back slowly. This is why I'm saying Bob, you have to go back to your old life. Everything will be alright. What life Doctor? Your son, Benny! And there, Your wife, Mary. Doctor I'm not understanding. How can I go with them? They... Forget having a son and a wife... I can't even remember getting married. What do you think? Has he really lost his memory or is he lying? 200% lying. Even a man with low libido can't forget a wife like that. Sir? Update? Sir, he just got discharged. His family is here. Okay. As soon as he is ready, start the work. What do we do with Bob when the work is over? First, start the work... Finish it... then we'll decide about Bob. Clear? Yes sir. What else do I have to do? Nothing doctor. Your work is over. Ours begin. Listen no... Shall we go to the church first or do you want to go straight home? Church. I knew it! You haven't changed at all. But Miss, I'm working day and night. 24 hours I'm solving papers. I can see that. Your work has significantly improved but still a long way to go. Joint is a tough exam Mini. You have to work hard. How easily she said "Work Harder". What else am I supposed to do? I can't study for 24 hours, even my battery goes down. So use this. Your battery will get charged. That's all that is left. Need to find a charger and plug it in every night. Let it go. Just try your best. What else can you do? No. I need to get into Medicine. No matter what. Wait. It's for Mini. Mini? Bob! Here, take your charger. Just take one and you'll be able to work through the night. Mad or what? I don't want any drugs. Hey! Who told you this was a drug? Everyone takes it. I always take them during exams. Have it now, stop it after exams. I want to see you back in the church Bob. Like how you used to come to meet me and David. You've got a new lease of life, be grateful to that. Come. Go, Benny, wash up. Fast. You like our house? It's very nice but I don't remember anything. This one you're not meant to. We only moved in 5 years back. I had to sell the old house and then get this one on rent. Where did we live before? Kalighat. Near the Metro station. This house is a bit small but the terrace is fantastic. Come, I'll show you. Go. Show. Come no. Go. I'm not allowed to come to the terrace alone. Now I can come with you. Do you know how to fly a kite? I'll teach you. And this is my room. Do you have a room? You can stay with me. Look who's here! Mini? Come, let's eat food? Come Benny. And remember what the doctor said. Just assume your father remembers everything. Don't remind him of anything unless he asks. This is the only way to bring his memory back. Okay? Your name is Bob Biswas. Apparently, you have a wife a son and even a daughter! Did you know? Huh? This is when all of us went to Nicco Park. Mini you looked so different! Where am I? In there. Huh? Where? Here! I'm going to my room. Need to finish off some papers. Hey, how was the meeting? It was okay. She said I need to work harder. "Harder"?! But you are studying so much already! Evidently not enough. Ma, will you... - Yes I will make you some coffee. Thank you. MA! MA! Ma, he is singing again! Didn't you talk to him? I did. But he doesn't listen. What can I do? Just shut the window. Yeah. Easy for you to say. You are not sitting for an exam are you? But I did try to talk to that idiot. Who? Our idiot neighbour. Every night the idiot has to practice his singing. Please go give her the coffee. Me? If I go she'll scold me again! Yes? Your mother has sent coffee for you. Thank you. You have to study so much? Yes. Who's that? My father. Still awake! Well, he has been sleeping till now. How much more? Do you think he'll get to sleep with his wife tonight? There you are! What are you doing here? Aren't you going to sleep? I don't know where to sleep! Well for most of your life you have slept beside me so might as well continue. Mini you didn't sleep? If you continue like this, you'll need a doctor before you become one. Ma, close the door. Mini, remember to shut all the windows before you leave! She's still studying! I don't know where that girl gets her energy from. That's the singer. He won some reality show. We got so lucky with our children. After so many years without a father in their life they've turned out alright. There's a photo in Mini's room. David's photo. She said he was her father. David was my first husband. Mary is this who I think... Yes. This is my husband Bob and this is Jayanti. Her best friend. Yes, my best friend. So Bob da when are you giving me a treat? You owe me a treat. Soon. Will you be able to go back home? One minute. Keep my mobile. I'm typing my office number, call me if you need anything. Bob babu! I need you to come with me. Why? - I'll explain later. But... - Nothing to worry about Bob babu. We're all old friends here. Let's go... Bob babu. You slept well last night? Yes. Let's go. Are you from the police? I guess you can say that. Bob Babu Coffee? Bob babu, sorry for dragging you like this. You must be thinking about who we are. I am Jishu Narang, and this is my colleague Kharaj Sahu. Hello. We work for the special branch, and our job is to maintain the balance between the good and bad in our society. You know, so on so forth... I don't understand. Why am I here? Just a regular update. To find out how things are. Is everything okay with you? How are you feeling, now that you can go out? Happy to be with your family? I'd have loved that. So Bob babu we had a small request. Since we did so much for you to get your freedom and family back. We felt you should also do something in return for us. I don't understand. What do I do? Oh no, I forgot! You don't remember anything, do you? No. You don't remember what you did? As in your work, what you do? I thought your memory would be back by now after meeting your family. Especially after meeting your wife. Do you recognise anyone from here? No? I'll give you a hint. They all have one thing in common. No? One minute. Now? No? You killed all of them. And there are many more like them. Why would I kill anyone? For money? Bob babu, is it true that you're a very rich man? There's a rumour that you have a lot of cash hidden away somewhere? Let's cut to the chase Bob babu. We need you to get back to doing what you did best. But this time only for us. Keep this. We will only contact you and don't even contact us by mistake. Why should I believe you? That is up to you. If you value your freedom and your family then... Bob Babu is thinking that he is a very good man how can he do something so bad? Isn't it? Have I done this work for you before? Who knows! You tell me if you remember. It's been a while, and Benny really loves your Hakka noodles. You remember Dhonu? Hello. He relentlessly looked after us. He even followed us from Kalighat with his stall. Sister, wherever you guys are, I will always be there. Even now see... He has brought Hakka noodles for Benny. Benny really loves Hakka noodles. Just like Bob da. You guys talk, I'll be back. So good to see you back Bob da. You must come to the stall and have some noodles. Well, it's your stall only. My stall? If you didn't give me the money how would I've started the stall? I owe everything to you and sister. Is everything ok Bob da? I saw you going in that car. Ok Bob da, I'll leave now. But if you need anything, let me know. Anything! You killed all of them... Yes tell me. I hope I am not disturbing you... Yes, you are disturbing me. Sorry. My daughter has an exam. So if you could please shut your windows because the singing is disturbing her studies. My singing is disturbing her? "My singing"? And you have come to my house to tell me to stop singing? Yes. But just till her exam. That'll be very kind of you. You know how much people pay to hear me singing? How many contests I have won? Any idea? No. You don't? Well I suggest you tell your daughter to study harder. And to mind her own business. And also, remember one thing. Just because I live next door, don't com and ring the bell whenever you want. Do you understand? Now leave. Why would you even think of talking to him? I thought he might listen. He is not a good person. People like us are not capable of handling people like him. Give me my phone please. Oh, one text came for you. Message? Another idiot. The world is full of these bad men. Am I a good man or a bad man? Why? I can't remember. Let me tell you. My world is filled with such characters. You are the only good person in my life. Why don't you complain about him? I can't. He is too senior and I need the job. Why? What do you mean why? I need to pay the rent. Benny's fees, Mini's fees, how can I just quit? What job did I do? You used to sell life insurance. Surprisingly I cannot find a single sale made by you! But I must have sold something. I did work here. Areh! Bob da? Where have you been? You know him? Of course. Bob da and I, joined at the same time. But Bob da, you have changed a bit. Okay, Mr. Biswas, let's give this a shot. We will try you out for a month, please start tomorrow. Hello. All set Bob Babu? Ready to start? No. I need more time. Time? That's one thing you don't have. I would advise you to rush. Client. Hello? Hello? Take. Bob da... Is there something wrong? This is your third plate. One after another! That same old habit, eating when you are stressed. Bob da... Tell me. I've to get back to work. What? Bob da. Listen to me. Once, go and meet Kali Da. He can help you. Kali da? This is... Kali Da's shop address. Only two pills every night. Now don't take any more just because they taste sweet. These are medicine, not sweets. Go. Oh! Look who it is! Bob babu? Come. Greetings! What a pleasant surprise. I heard you were back but wasn't expecting you so soon. Kali Da? Yes! 'Ekam evadvitiyam' Meaning, the one and only, Kali Krishna Paul. Always at your service. A little older, but still young at heart. Tell me. Kali da I need your help... Are you okay Bob babu? I heard you have a problem with your memory. I can't remember anything... But... I need to get back to work. So you are having sleeping problems? No. I can sleep. Are you sure you can't sleep? No Kali da, I'm not having any sleeping... Yes, you have a problem sleeping. You don't realise it but you are. I will get you your medicine. Wait. Even I can't sleep at night. But I can sleep! Nux Vomica. Best for sleeping problems. Even earlier when you had this problem I gave you Nux Vomica only. Not now, at night, after dinner. But I don't have any money, Kali Da. Chee Chee! What are you saying Bob babu! I exist because of you. Our relationship is much above money. Give me when you can. Now what problem do you have at night? Go home Bob babu. We'll take care of this. Oh! Where were you? I was taking the garbage out. Oh, thank you. Now go wash your hands. What man! Now we have to clean his shit also or what? Look at the bright side. At least he started work. What happened Bob? What happened? It's okay, Bob. It's okay. Sir. Is Bob ready? No. - Yes. He's ready sir. Sir, he took out an innocent man. Collateral damage sir. We've taken care of it. But he's ready. Let's start immediately. We can't let this Blue situation going out of our hands. Ishaan. I never thought you'd talk to me again. Neither did I but I need some help. Tell me. I need some Blue. What the... Why does everyone come to me only for Blue? I have other talents also. Sorry. Bad idea. Forget it. - Wait. I don't have but we can get it easily. Come with me in the evening? Why? We can go out for a drink? Just joking. You want Blue right? Let's go, get it. Where? Paris bar. Didn't I tell you not to call me ever. Sorry... But you've sent me a photo. Yes. Your first job. And where do I find him? Ta ra ra... Bubai da. Bubai da I need some. Please Bubai da. Shontu my brother, you wait here. I'll be with you in a second. No Bubai da please don't go. I really need it, Bubai da. I'll do whatever you want. Tell me who to hi... Oh, don't be silly. You are my brother. Just wait here. Just give me a minute. Yes? Promise you'll give me. You're such a kid. Of course I promise. I'll give you some. Is he okay? Don't mind him. He is my cousin. We have some family issues. Thank you Bubai da. Enjoy. Are you coming back to the bar? No no you carry on. I have to make a call. Let's go. Oye moron... Come here. What do you think you were doing? Embarrassing me in front of my clients? How dare you? I'm sorry Bubai da. I just want one Blue. Hey... Get lost! Bubai da, I will never bother you again. Just one please. - You want Blue? Come here... I'll give you some. Here have. Why one? Open your mouth. Have as many as you want. Open your mouth. Now get out of here and never come back. Hello. You sure? You don't mind? But just one drink, after that, I have to go home. Your wish is my command! Don't bloody shout at me. Money doesn't fall from the sky. I also have to work to put food on your table. What do you want? Nothing. Who are you? No not you. What do you want? I'll call you back. Oye what do you want? Tell me fast. You better answer me buddy. What do you want? One minute. Hey! Mini?! What are you doing here? I came to meet a client. You? I was studying with a friend. Shall we go? You always wanted to be a doctor? I don't remember but apparently my dad really wanted me to. That's what ma and Doctor uncle tells me. Doctor uncle? Dad and he used to work together. He really helps with my studies when I get stuck. Do you remember my dad? It happens. Even I sometimes forget David's face and I was married to him! Things change with time, Bob. Even if you don't want to change time makes you change. You don't miss him? I do. At times. What are the police saying? They were all shot dead by the same person. And the Blue in the car? Untouched. The police have confiscated that. So whoever this person is... Did not come to steal. But only to kill. He is just against us and not our work. Ustaad the money I have invested is safe right? Yes. Good. Then I will leave you to it. Bring him in. Oye. Ustaad is calling you. Find out who killed Bubai. Your dosage of Nux Vomica. They are like sugar balls. Don't have too many at a time. You worry about yourself now Kundu babu. Bob babu knows what to do. Always poking your nose everywhere! So Bob Babu... work is good? Who knows Kali Da? What happened? I don't know what I'm doing. Whether I should be doing this work or was I meant for this work only? Such is life Bob babu. We don't realise it but we only do what we are created for. It's already written. I don't understand. You don't understand? Look there. It's Kaliya Daman's picture. When Lord Krishna defeated Kaliya, he asked the serpent... Not Kaliya like me, poisonous snake... The Lord asked, Kaliya how do you have so much poison? You have destroyed so many villages, killed so many people... Where did you get so much poison? Kaliya looked at Lord Krishna and said But my lord you didn't give me anything else! God creates and god only destroys... Mary. He's refusing to talk. What happened? Hey, look at me. Either you tell me or you stop crying. Otherwise, I'll also start crying, and we will both look very silly in front of the teacher. What happened? See it's so cute. Ahhh. This is my rabbit, how dare you touch it? This is my rabbit... - I'm sorry. This is my rabbit! I only wanted to play with the bunny. Bye-bye, we'll meet tomorrow. Yes, remember to do your homework. Where did you get this rabbit? - My father got it from America. Oh right. Bye-bye. - Bye-bye. Hello. Oh! So cute. You are Ayan from Benny's class no? Yes Ayan I have a small request. Yes tell me. You mustn't hit Benny again. Because if you do... Got it? Have you seen your father? There you are. Why do you sit here every night? Nothing. I just like this. Very peaceful. Helps me to think. It is very peaceful. Hey, where's that nutcase neighbour? Haven't heard him singing for a while. You needed something? Yes. I needed my husband. I get worried when I don't see you. Why? I don't know. After David passed away, I wouldn't have survived without you. You were like an angel from heaven, who came to save me and Mini. And then that accident... I prayed to the Lord every day to return you to me and look he did. Promise me. You will never leave us again. I never want to leave this house. Sometimes I wonder what good deeds have I done to deserve this family? I don't want to lose our family. I never want to be far from Benny and Mini. Superb! Family. House. Mini. Benny. You have taken every name. Except for the one in front of you. You are everything. I am more scared of you leaving me than anything. That's why, I sit here every night, trying to remember the life we had. Our life Our marriage. Mini, Benny, David, everything. But I can't remember anything. I try really hard but... Do you remember this? What is it? Greetings. One minute. Excuse me. Bob?! Water? What happened? Are you okay? What, you scared me, Bob Biswas. Forgive me father for I have sinned. Whatever we do, there is always a chance of doing something wrong. No father. What I did was wrong. Good. Realising you did something wrong is also a good thing. Going forward, just concentrate on doing good deeds. With that, will my past mistakes go away? No my son. You reap what you sow. Our sins are the debts we carry, and hence we all must pay for our sins. What if I don't pay? What if I run away? I wish it was that easy, my son. Your karma is like your shadow. No matter how much you run... You can never outrun your own shadow. You want anything? You want to go to the terrace? I want to go to the terrace. You will go straight to your room and do your homework. Why can't I do my homework on the terrace? Because your mother is telling you to. Go. Again you are eating noodles, Plate after plate! This is your fourth plate. What is wrong? Dhonu, I have taken a large debt, and I don't know how to pay it off. Bob da... I have some money. I can lend you some. It won't be solved with money. Then that's good, you don't have to pay it off. I will have to. Dhonu you reap what you sow. What? Dhonu, this debt is like a restaurant where you have already cooked your own food. And you will have to eat it. Understood? Bob, I didn't understand anything. Whatever it is, I think, you should talk to Mary sister once. No. Not Mary. Bob da listen to me. I'm telling you... Our Mary sister is like Mother Mary. She will solve all your problems. Please talk to her at least once. Hello. This is Bob. I know. I can see your name. Is everything okay? - Yes yes. Everything is fine. Do you want to have lunch together? I have a better offer. Let's do dinner together, followed by breakfast. No, lunch will do. Okay. But I'll have to ask my husband for permission. Oh. Okay. You idiot. Of course, I will have lunch with you. Madam, Souvik sir is calling you in his cabin. Okay bye. Dhonu!? You are back after so long. Greetings! I need some Arnica Kali da. Okay. I didn't know you were working again. Take. What to do Kali Da! Some people you cannot refuse. Work is to be accepted not refused. Kali Da... Anybody new in town buying medicine? Honour among thieves Dhonu. Honour among thieves. You see this shop of mine? This is my world of honour. And that door? That's the line of honour. No word from outside can come in from outside. And no word from inside can go outside. In our world, there are some rules. That you can't break. Or I can break. Live by rules. - Correct. Live by rules. No rules, no life. Sorry Kali da. My mistake to ask. No problem, even god makes mistakes. Go forward, enjoy life. I had so much work. What do you want? Inspector Indira Verma. I want to check your CCTV. There's no one here right now, come back later. I have come to see the footage. Not to see anyone. I just told you there is no one here. Now go. Show your police power somewhere else. What's your name? Madan. Madan. Either you show me the footage or you try to stop me and I am okay with both. Yes Ma'am. You know this girl? No. But I know the boy she came with. Who is he? His name is Ishaan. Give me his details. Yes ma'am. Indira. Yes? Sorry which doctor? Okay, I'll be there. Oye chowmein... Where do you think you're going? Go away. "Chowmein"? That's not a nice thing to say. - Why? What will you do? Karate chop me? Now get out of here. I just need some information. Mary?! Mary, are you going out for lunch? Yes. - Come I will buy you lunch... Mr. Das my husband is waiting for me. If you'll excuse me. Just to set the records straight. Next time you want to have "lunch together" you have to take me somewhere and not share my lunch. So what is this about? I was thinking after Mini gets into college, should we go and stay somewhere? Somewhere else? Kalimpong? Darjeeling? Dhonu was saying they are beautiful places. You mean to shift? From Kolkata? Why? Why do you want to run away from Kolkata? That too Kalimpong. It'll be nice and peaceful. You, me, and Benny. And not too far from Kolkata. We can come and meet Mini whenever we want. Not that easy to just give up everything and shift. Mini going to college will be expensive, plus to relocate, we will need a lot of money which, my husband, unfortunately, we don't have. We don't have any money? No. Whatever I got from selling the old house went into your treatment. And all these years that I worked? Nope. No savings that I know of. 'You're a very rich man...' 'You have a lot of cash stashed away somewhere..' Sir? Sir, please help. Some change. You don't have any money? I have. But I can't remember. You wanted to see me, doctor. Indira? - Yes. Give me a second, I want to show you something. Weirdly enough the drug found in his body has a composition very similar to a drug banned almost a couple of decades ago. What drug? Well, it never reached the market. It was made for Attention Deficiency problems but tests found that people could get really addicted to it. I remember because I read all the research on that. Do you think it's the same drug? Feels like it, but not sure. I would need a proper comparison. I'll call up New Life Pharma to see if they still have a copy of that paper. New life Pharma? That's the company which made that drug. I see. Whatever this Blue is it's very scary. 'The number you've dialed is not answering.' Excuse me who are you? Doctor. I'm Dhonu. Sorry. Nux Vomica. Who uses this? Don't know Ustaad. Find out. Ustaad, we can beat it out of Kali Da. - No. Nobody touches him. He only sells, it's not his lookout what happens after. But Ustaad... - No buts. Rules are rules. Kali is out of bounds. Is that clear? Go find out. Ishaan I need to talk to you. Not now. Later. It's important. Can't you see that I'm busy? So you're saying you don't know this man? Nope. Can't say I do. Apparently, there was a girl with you that evening. Possible. I go out with a lot of girls. But can't remember who it was that night. Could we talk? Who are you? I'm Indira Verma. Police. Police!? Why do you need to talk to me? Nothing just wondering if you could tell me about the night you went to Paris bar To his credit, he didn't say a word about you but... There's nothing to say. I just went to have a drink, that's all. Did you see this man that night? No. I didn't. Sure? Yes. So you just went and had a drink? Yes and then I left. Ishaan stayed back but I left. Where did you go? I came home with my dad. Your dad!? Your dad was with you? No, I met him on the way back. What was your dad doing there? I don't know. You'll need to ask him. Look I've to go now. I'm getting late for church. I want to see you back in the church Bob. Like when you used to come and meet me and David. Let's go, I'm late, got to go to work. Where are you going? I'm going to meet Doctor uncle. Okay great, we'll go together halfway. And you? I've to meet a client near by and then I'll go to work. Okay, bye, come on! Sorry. 'Who knows! You tell me if you remember.' Bob Da! One lady is here to see you. Who is this? His name is Bubai. This man was shot dead along with two other men that night. Oh! You didn't happen to see anything unusual, did you? Nothing. What were you doing in that area? I was just passing by. I had gone to meet a client. At that time of the evening? Life insurance business is like that only! There's a joke in our job circle... Client and death can call you any time! Good to know. So you were passing by when you met your daughter? Yes. Any idea what your daughter was doing in that area? She was studying with some friends. Poor girl has her medical entrance exam, so she studies hard. Bob babu do you know what this man did? These are Blue sold as medicine to desperate students., who'll do anything to pass their exams. And one such student died from an overdose last week. And there will be many more. Bubai da, used to sell these. Mini? What are you doing? Mini I found this. What is it? It was in your drawer. So? Some rubbish I must have bought. But why are you snooping in my room? Mini is there something you are hiding from me? What? What would I hide? Apparently, there are some drugs called Blue being sold as medicine.. So? Are you saying I'm using drugs? just by finding that random pouch? No, I'm not saying that but I'm just worried about you. You don't need to worry about me, you aren't my father. Mini, what are you saying... Please, I need to study. Contract? On me? Bob babu? I thought I recognised you. What are you doing here? Er... Client. Here? At this time? Oh sorry I forgot. Death and client can call you anytime, yes? Yes. Nice meeting you again Indira. I came to meet my senior officer, Durga Dwivedi. We got a tip-off that there is a contract on her head because she is the one fighting against the drug dealers. The people who make Blue. She is the one fighting to clean our society. So this world is safe for our children. But why are you telling me this? Because you look like a responsible father. Have you got my anniversary gift? I knew it. I tell you what, I'm going to book us a holiday in Kalimpong and if I like the place then we can think of shifting. Happy Anniversary! Sir. Yes Mary. Come in. There has been a complaint about you. About me? What have I done? You've used office resources to do personal work. That's not allowed. You've been booking personal holidays during working hours. But sir, I only booked a hotel in Kalimp and that too during lunch hours. So you are admitting you did use office resources for personal work. I don't see how this is wrong in any way. I will have to report you in unless... If you want, this report doesn't have to be written up. And you won't lose your job. Sir, if you continue like this I will tell my husband. Please do. But I doubt if he will be able to save your job. Only I can save your job. Think about it and get back to me. That was quick. What are you doing? Thought about it! - Mary, Mary... Why should I bother my husband? I am enough for scum like you. You actually beat him with your slippers? After a point, I thought he was going to cry. You should have told me. What would you have done? You can't even harm a fly. Yes. That is true. But what about your job? Who cares. I have my husband... He'll take care of me. Bob babu, come. Come. I've to talk to you. Why didn't you carry out the work? I didn't want to. You didn't want to? And what gives you the power of deciding what you want to do? What changed your mind? She looked like an honest person. Why do you want me to kill her? Who told you how she is? You have no idea about her. She is fighting against drugs. Where is all this coming from? You have been assigned a task and you're supposed to do it. Get it done Bob. I don't want to. I don't want to do this anymore. I told you he's not ready. Listen you moron. You exist because of us. Your freedom is because we allow it. You get to sleep with your wife because we let you. So don't mess with us because we will take all this away even before y step out of this car. What about the diary? What diary? What are you talking about? The diary in which all details are kept of all the hits. Who ordered the hits on whom and how much was paid... That diary. So? So nothing. Remember I asked you, had I done this work for you before... Where is this diary? I can't remember. He is lying, there is no diary, he's bluffing. What if he's not? If he has a diary, your name will be there. Then get rid of him. We don't need Bob anymore. But we need the diary first... Shekhar - Ma'am. Do we have any more leads on this 'Ustaad'? Apparently, he put out a hit on me. What? Uh...Sorry. This is Inspector Indira Verma. She is the one who found out. How can someone put a contract on a police officer. Sir, we had an undercover officer, Rahul Khanna, working on the case. But he was killed before he could get any closer. But surprisingly the same person also killed Ustaad's right-hand man Bubai. He killed Ustaad's man and a police officer? Yes, he killed both of them. Sure? That's what the forensic reports say. And then there was the contract on ma'am. This sounds very convoluted. Do we have any more clarity? No. Except for a random person called Bob Biswas. Who? Bob Biswas. Works in a life insurance company and has a full fledged family. Looks like a good man. But I don't know why but my gut feeling tells me he is connected to all this. Then arrest him. I will sir after I find proof. At the moment I don't have anything. Rahul was a police informant?! Not an informant, proper police. We took him out for you. What do you want from this? Fifty percent. And we'll look after you. You will never have to bother about the law or anyone who gets in your way. And if I don't agree? Then the police and many others will get in your way, and we won't be able to help you. Here, as an offering of peace and long friendship the man who you are looking for, you can have him. But he has a diary which I need. I don't need Nux Vomica anymore Kali DaÃ. I'm retiring. You let me know how much I owe you. The moment I get my commission I will pay you back. Not to worry. As and when you can. This shop will always be open for you. Kali da? One last thing, I found this key. Would you by any chance know what this is? Yes. Come with me. That trunk is yours. Your key should open it. My trunk? - Yes I have a trunk? What's in it? Your trunk. How should I know? But Kali da you never told me before. Rules are rules. My job is not to say anything. Only when I'm asked. You asked I answered. And please also remember, you owe me rent for the trunk. But don't worry give whenever you can. Kali Da, my rent, and bills till now Thank you. And this is for you. You don't need to... I need to. You have no idea. This money isn't money. This is a chance to pay my debts. I gave up the bad and good things are happening. We can relocate, I can give Mary the best life possible. Such is life Bob babu, when god gives, he gives in abundance. Enjoy. Such is life. Such is life. I remembered. Remembered? Dhonu! Ustaad you called me? Yes. We found Nux Vomica. I won't do it Ustaad. I don't care, get me from somewhere. Mini calm down. There has been some gang war or something. There are no Blue available. But I need some. I have an exam. I know you have some. Give me. I don't. And even if I had, I wouldn't have given it to you. Look at yourself! Stop this Blue shit. Wherever I go, someone wants to try to be my father. Mini... - Don't touch me. Where are you going? Kalimpong. - Why? To rest. Is papa also going? Why, should I be going with you? Who will look after me? Your sister. But she is never there. Benny be quiet. We are only going for three days. Nothing will happen to you. I have told your sister to stay at home. Thank you for giving me one more chance. For Mary, Benny, Mini. When I wasn't there you looked after them thank you. Thank you for everything. I know what I did was wrong. But I promise you, I will never let Mary down. I will always look after everyone. Thank you. Bob you look very happy. Yes Father. Remember you told me that, I got a new lease on life? I am starting that new life now. And watch, I'm going to pay off all my debts. That's great. Thank you. Oh, you're here! I have some good news. We have money. My old sales commission came through. That's good news no? Hey how has Benny has gone to bed so early? I made him. Why? You want to go to the terrace? I found this in your pocket. I gave this to David. Whoever mugged and killed David... Also stole his wallet and his bracelet. How did you get this Bob? You weren't even in the city that day. Mary, I will... Bob! Greetings, Bob Babu I am Sambhu and this is my brother, Bhanu. What is wrong with you? If you want him to talk, then why are you hitting him, you moron? Please don't hit him. No, we won't hit him anymore No tension sister. Bob babu, just tell us where the diary is. Which diary? Oye idiot, will you please let me do my work? Bob babu, just give us the diary. You and I will be happy. I don't have any diary. You killed Bubai with this hand right? Give me this hand, Bob Babu! Bob! You stay there, sister. Give us the diary. Otherwise, we'll have to take your other hand. What diary are you talking about? If he doesn't have it, how will he give it to you? You haven't told her, have you? I don't remember anything. Try harder Bob babu. Either we leave with the diary, or your wife's life. No. Wait. I think I remember... What diary Bob? Mary, it'll be okay. Trust me. It's in Kali Da's shop. No matter which road you take. All roads lead to Kali da. Come. We will take our leave now. Goodbye. Bob. Bob. - Are you alright? Benny! Bob! What is happening? What diary were they talking about? Mary, forgive me. I'll tell you the truth. One more thing, Bob babu. You know the rules of the game. Once you accept the work, you have to deliver. Rules are rules. Bob! Sorry Bob babu, wrong target. I don't know why she came in the way. Mom! Come on, stop talking, start shooting. Father had said... You can't run away. You cannot run from your own shadow! But Indira, the debts were mine. Why did my family have to pay for my sins? It's my debt, I should have paid for it... Yesterday in church I promised I would look after them. But in front of me... Mary and Benny... I couldn't save them. I couldn't save them. Let's go. What has happened to you? Come. Come. Your right hand has gone. You have to go see a doctor... - No. I need to go to the trunk room. Sure. This is your house only. Also, Kali Da... I need Nux Vomica again. Kali Da, I need you do something for me. What? This bag is for Mini. Please give it to her. And this diary is for Inspector Indira Verma. And this is for you. Will we meet again? Inside this... I have put some extra Nux Vomica. This bag? This bag used to be my lucky bag, now it's yours. Fantastic! Bob babu? This is a lot of money for such small work. Anything else you want me to do? Yes. If you ever hear I'm dead. Bury me beside Mary, Kali Da. You?! What are you doing out? Oh! She let him go on purpose. Jishu babu, will you please take me to Ustaad? Which Ustaad you moron? Jishu babu please? No harm will come to you. Promise. Ustaad... Jishu da? Sir. Greetings. Bob Biswas. How dare you shoot my men? One minute. Are you Ustaad? No. I am... Ustaad? Mini. Yes Doctor Uncle? Mini, why are you here? Mini! Put that gun down... You wanted Blue, right? Put it down. This Blue will help you to become a doctor. Mini, put the gun down. Mini, you know what to do. Lift the gun and shoot. Put it down. You are wasting time Mini. Just come here. Put the gun down. Have you told her... - Just come here. that you killed her mother? What? What happened to Ma? Don't listen to him. - What did you do to her? Drop the gun and come here. - Where is Ma? Come here! - Where is Ma? Kids today! Don't listen to their parents but will do anything for Blue. Why did you kill Mary and Benny? Your fight was with me. That's the rule of war Bob. Only innocents die. We fight. And they die. You go ahead Bob, I will send Mini too. Full family together. Kali Da knew, I'd need extra Nux Vomica. Stop. I can make this better for you. We can do this business together. Together we will be invincible. Nobody will be able to touch us. What's the point? You still can't run from your own shadow. Where's Ma? All under control? Yes Ma'am. And Bob? Like you instructed his name is nowhere near the case. Good. Mini. Just listen to me. I've told you before, I've nothing to say to you. Mini... how long will we stay like this? Not talking to each other, this isn't normal. We live together. I don't have anywhere else to go, hence I stay at home. But if you want, I can leave today... - No... I won't say anything. Just don't leave. Look, she is still angry. She hasn't forgiven me yet. She has turned out just like you. I'm coming Mary. I don't like living without you. Wait for me. Just give me some time to make sure Mini is settled and then I will come and join you. Greetings! Bob Biswas. One minute.
