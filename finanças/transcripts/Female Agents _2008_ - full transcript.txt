His holster was open and he hadn?t even noticed. But nothing happened. What should have happened?. Nothing. But it gives you ideas. We should kill all the Krauts. We?ve got to go. Help me with the case. What about Gaelle?. We?ve no time. What do you want?. You have no right! This is an educational institution for children! Find the Principal. Children, stand to one side. Keep to the walls! We?ve searched all over and found nothing. Search again! Left at the bottom. Towards the sewers. Check the wardrobe! Weapons! Call the colonel! Did your brother know where we were?. He didn?t give us away. Somebody must have done. If not him, Gaelle. If ever I run into her again... Principal... what do you teach your pupils eXactly?. Where is Louise Desfontaines?. I know nobody of that name. Your cyanide pill?. I?m scared. You don?t know what that means. Come closer. Come on. Let go of her! Recruiting women so young. I?m disappointed in Buckmaster. I?m going to need your services again. Your friends got away from me. Where and when was the back-up?. The back-up?. Don?t act dumb, I know the SOE?s methods. Louise knows now that I betrayed them. She won?t come to the rendezvous. She?s a woman who likes to take risks. If I talk, what?s in it for me?. Your freedom. To be tried and sentenced by the SOE?. You prefer us to torture you?. Tomorrow noon. Concorde Metro. Pont de Neuilly platform. Champagne?. Thanks. Thanks. Fabulous! Thanks to you, l?ll be back in the Colonel?s good books. What Colonel?. The one l?ll introduce you to tomorrow. Hold on, l?ll show you. Here, look. Honest, you?re the spitting image of his floozy. You?re heaven sent. Are you eXpecting someone?. No, nobody.

That?s your mission?. You made a real fool of me! You?re all scum! You, Pierre, Buck and the whole SOE! The SOE?. What?s your cousin talking about?. I?ll never see Heindrich again. I?d rather die right now. You?ll get me in his room dead. Easy! That?s my shroud! What?s got into her?. What?s all that about Heindrich?. We?ll stay here now. Help me tie him up. I?ll warn Buck about the lnstitute. Stop! Calm down, Suzy. You can?t force me to see him again. Nobody can. All this over a guy. And a Nazi! I didn?t sleep with a Nazi. I fell in love with a German. It?s different. Stop! Listen... The only thing we want is for you to meet him. A moment, a brief moment. Jeanne and l will take care of the rest. You can?t let us down now. We need you. It?ll be fine. We were to get married in St. Germain. He bought me a wonderful dress. And you got him a uniform?. He joined the Hitler Youth to get into officer training school. Don?t make eXcuses for him. A Nazi or a Resistance fighter, it?s the same to me. No, it?s... It was marriage that repulsed me. Belonging to a man. It?s as simple as that. It doesn?t matter. You did right, if not for the right reasons. He never knew I was pregnant. You?ve got a kid?. I wouldn?t be a good mother. You got rid of it?. You gave it up?. A family in Liverpool. No more Nazi Dad and collaborator Mum. For him, the slate?s clean. No answer from London?. No! We have seven minutes before she has to stop transmitting. Do you want a coffee?. A real one?. 100% black market. Suzy?s cut up about what she did. Why?. Maybe she?d have been a terrible mother. How can you say that?. EXcept dying, nothing worse can happen to a kid. There?s always worse. Pity isn?t your strong point. Try to be a little bit human for once. In the train, I found out l?m pregnant. I can?t be more human. My husband and l had been trying for kids for years. London?s come through! And?. Buckmaster asks you to make contact tomorrow with a certain Melchior.

Why does Buck want her back?. He?s sure Heindrich will be there. You will eXecute him. In the Metro?. In public?. Safer than the Regina. You don?t trust Suzy anymore?. Only to lure him in. For the rest, Buck prefers to rely on you. In the Metro, some of the staff will help. To carry it. Is that okay?. What about my brother?. Any news?. He?s still alive. Any hope of him escaping?. Buck doesn?t want you to endanger the operation. I always see my missions through to the end, but I won?t let my brother be beheaded as a spy. Jeanne?. You bastard, you stole a Jewish family?s place.
