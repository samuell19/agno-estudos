PHOTOGRAPHER BARKER RYNDE Specialty: Wedding Photography PRIVATE DETECTIVE J. BARKER RYNDE Specialty: Divorces Awesome. About that job tonight. One bedroom on the second floor. This is the stuff: Ladder... camera, listening devices, sneakers and a drill. Wait a second. And something to eat? -Come on, Captain. Sandwiches with cheese, hard-boiled eggs, pickles and chips. And the dessert? -Cherry and apple pie. Delicious. Add another slice of fruit-nut chocolate. Hello? A moment. I will ask. To peek or sniff? -Photography or detective work? sniff. I'll redirect you. With Captain Barker Rynde. With Mrs Margaret Clifford. Listen, my dear man. I want you to follow someone. Someone I know well. I understand. - I saw you in the phone book. A moment. Is that you, Roger? Go check it out. Sorry, I thought I heard my cousin. Come tomorrow to the Green Glades Hotel in Studholme. Just as a guest. -Naturally. If you're here, wait for me to contact you. Tomorrow morning you will receive a check for 75 gienjes. You will be accommodated for a week. Good day. 75 bucks for a week? That's over 75 pounds. We made it, Fred. We belong to the bigwigs. A real society affair? We'll be in the Sunday paper. "Memoirs of a Private Investigator." "What I saw through keyholes." -That makes a lot of money. Huge amount of money. I'm getting a little dizzy. - Sit down. I'll pour you one more time. GREEN GLADES Spa Hotel Good morning. Welcome to Green Glades. I'll take that. In here? Good morning. Mr. J. Barker Rynde? - Captain. With a y. And an e. -Of course. Informal atmosphere. -We don't care about fuss. And this one. -I'll take that. Those are my business papers. Nice and fresh here. -That stimulates the appetite. Yes. Where is the dining room? -That's coming soon. First the registration interview. -I'm starving. Ms. Roitman. -May I have the mail for Mrs Clifford? Thank you. I'm in the bar in case anyone needs me. Indeed. Very nice. Who is that? The secretary of one of our guests: Mrs Clifford. Nice for Mr. Clifford. If anyone is looking for me, I'm in the bar too. Good morning. Good morning. Interesting. Give me one too. -I don't know if it's for you. Is it strong? You have to try everything once. Thank you. Cheers. I warned you. -What is it? Mainly carrot juice. With a little apple cider vinegar marjoram bitters and aloe. The concoctions that you ladies gulp down. This is how this country is going to hell. I'll teach you how to drink. Rhubarb juice, nettle beer, iodine drink, parsnip sorbet, cabbage bowl, rapeseed juice ... or skim goat's milk? Did you expect something tastier? This is indeed a spa where they do not spare you. Spa? -Others still serve fruit juice. Are you OK? - Under the circumstances, yes. Mr. Rynde? Mr Rumbelow can see you. Follow me please. Spa? I don't think he knows what to expect. They never know. Take a seat. Our consultant will be there shortly. Mr Rynde? Rumbelow. Is he bruised now? -No, wet. My morning bath. I'll take some notes. Don't like dogs? -From some dogs. Sit down. Mr. J. Barker Rynde. Age? We're not going to pretend, are we? Just write down: 32. -Your age, or part of it. Profession? -Birdler. Married? -No. Why not? -Are you married? No. -Why not? I ask the questions. Are you deliberately single? My profession has made me allergic to weddings. Misogynistic ornithologist. Do you smoke? How many cigarettes a day? Depends on how many people I meet. -Any other habits? Is all this necessary? -You don't have any secrets from me, do you? Yes. A lot. I understand your reservations. It is clear. Look now. Slow look, flabby. Stick out your tongue. Tong. Terrible. Eyes. How on earth can you watch that? You are stiff as a corpse. You are here just in time. We are servants of Mother Nature. We'll get you fit again. You will receive a full treatment. Salt massages, sitz bath, steam bath, stretching exercises... and the standard cleaning sessions. Diet. We'll start with turnip pulp and carrot juice... and work towards the grass salads. Grass salads? -Your hunger will subside on its own. Your stomach will shrink. Shrink? -Treatment and dietary requirements. Could you come in for a second, Richards? Don't look so worried. We've saved worse cases. We wring out your abused body and start all over again. None of that. I like my body the way it is. What nonsense. Then what are you doing here? That's better. We often see threshold fear here. Inside. Show our new guest his room, Richards. You pay 75 gienjes per week. Cabin 29. Very refreshing. I regard your case as a personal challenge. How dare you? - I haven't eaten anything for almost an hour. There is no deviation from the diet. You will be punished mercilessly for that. Everyone out. There is no need to panic. What is going on? -A fire drill. This way. Can I have your attention? Sorry for these conditions. They are regulations. Will you answer when you hear your name? This way. No wall. He folds in. Only tonight. Bed, locker, water. It'll come. You look better already. "Dear Captain, Horatio is coming for you tonight at nine o'clock." 'Destroy it. M. Clifford. ' Destroy. Horatio? Oh, sorry. Is someone there? Hallo? Hallo? Mrs Clifford? Here's Captain Rynde. Are you there? Oh, here you are. Mrs. Clifford? Wake up once. Help. I need help. Where are you? -What is going on? What happened? -She passed out. She has to go in. I'm glad you're here. -Not me. I would go on vacation. What a pity. Dr. Crossley is waiting for you. That's the director. Is that right? Come with me. Which way? -Over here. Inside. This is Inspector Hook. -Good morning. This is my wife. What do you think? Murder. There was a toxic substance, ricin, in the carrot juice. That's quite a shock. -Not good for business, huh? That's not the point. We were very fond of Mrs Clifford. She was one of my husband's favorites. Then among the guests. Isn't it Julian? She's been coming here for years. She was more of a friend than a patient. I understand. I want to speak to your guests. Is that possible? Right now. I want to know everything about everyone who is leaving from now on. No one is leaving for next weekend. The killer can change his mind. Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention, please? Inspector Hook wants to say something. Thank you. Sorry to interrupt. I understand how annoying this is. Two guests were poisoned last night. One is recovering, the other is dead. I'm convinced it's murder. I understood from the director that no one is leaving before next week. I hope no one finds it necessary to reconsider their plans. I cannot force you to stay here. But should anyone want to end their stay... I need your name and address and I want to know the reason for your departure. Did you call? -That gentleman needs you. Can I help you? -I want an other room. Do you mean that? - I heard people walking yesterday. They screamed bloody murder. In a manner of speaking then. Can you arrange another room immediately? You are in cabin 29. Only cabin 28 is still available. Awesome. Then I try that. Will you arrange for my luggage to be moved? Sorry, I can't miss my salt massage. You made a nice impression this morning. Some have been hung for less. Your appearance works against you. You will have noticed that. That Hook wants to arrest someone anyway. You could be the prime suspect. -It was her husband. The deceased suspected him of peeing outside the pot. Impossible. He's been dead for years. What? -At least ten years. Is he really dead? - When they buried him, yes. He died on this table. -That doesn't surprise me. It did surprise us. Turn off. It's freezing. Of course. You get the best of the best here: ice water. That's enough for the first time. Turn off. Get him ready for the massage table, Richards. Poison is so sneaky. I prefer offenders with blunt objects. And you? -Me too. Few people have a better sense of sleuthing than me. I solved all unsolved crimes. In theory. I missed my calling. It's always about money. That makes some people animals. That nephew might get in trouble. He inherits everything. Roger gets about $250,000. Roger? But why the secretary? That may have been a mistake. - Say that. Shout out. The walls are soundproof. But Roger doesn't have the guts for such a thing. He lets someone else do dirty jobs. An assassin. Dear heavens. May I have your attention, please? This is the director speaking. I have an important announcement. The police have asked me to disclose the following: A reward has been offered... for information leading to the killer's arrest. And it's a significant reward: �2000. �2000? �2000? Captain. If he's captain, I'm Fidel Castro. I saw that right away. He looks so pale. Maybe he just got out of jail. Excuse me. I found this gem. Can you put a letter on the board? But of course, Captain. Please let me know if it is not picked up? Can I ask you something? -What? Do you have any chocolate? Of course not. Are you ready? Mr Rumbelow. -You didn't want to eat those berries, did you? Oh, no. -They're poisonous. Poisonous. Come on. This will only take a little while. This goes in here. Look at that. A walkie-talkie dog. Go ahead. Come in, Inspector. I was hoping you were home. I have a few more questions. I don't think I can help you. -One thing. What do you want? Have you ever seen this? -No, I don't believe it. The can of carrot juice. It was in the trash. Look here, on top. Do you see that hole? Someone inserted a needle and injected ricin into the juice. Interesting, huh? Nosy Parker. Did Mrs Clifford drink carrot juice more often? And Ms. Roitman? -Everyone did what Auntie did. Carrot juice went too far for me. I prefer stronger "poison." I understand. -Do you sometimes think... You think so, but you are completely wrong. I was very fond of the old man in my way... and I'm happy with what I'm getting now. I didn't kill her. And I'm not going to poison my own fiancé, am I? Your fiancé? -Ms. Roitman and I are engaged. I did not know that. You may go see her, Inspector. You were lucky, Ms. Roitman. -Absolutely. And your happiness is our happiness. -Why do you say that? The killer probably didn't think you could tell us anything else. Burton. I have a few more questions for you. How long were you Mrs Clifford's secretary? Not so long. About six months. I had to work after... After what? -After my divorce. Did Mrs Clifford confide in you about her affairs? About everything. We were friends. I was very fond of her. Was there anyone who had reason to want to get her out of the way? No. -You too? I don't know. -Hush. You had a card night with Mr Forrester, Mrs Clifford and Dr Crossley. What time did it start? -Around seven o'clock. We started with three. Dr Crossley was a little late. What time did it end? -Around nine. Mrs Clifford was tired. - Did she always go to bed this early? No. It was very unusual. She loved cards. She often played until midnight. What time was it when you had a drink? Just before we left. -Did you get the drinks? No. Dr Crossley got them from the kitchen. He hasn't played yet. -Is that right? Didn't I ask you to keep that bitch away? Go ahead, get out. Outwards. Go away, you terrible beast. It must be mating time. Good Lord. PATI�NTEN VAN MR RUMBELOW A - M Director. - Were you playing with my dog? Just a romp. She likes that. I'd rather let Junia out on her own. She came home completely exhausted. Are you responsible for the library? If your system is good, can you tell me why a book is missing. That is not possible. I have been taking care of the library for eleven years. A book has never been gone. It must have been misplaced. It has not been loaned out and is not on the shelf. Which book is it about? -Rudenheimer. Natural poison. Fascinating book. - The police think so too. The police? -Natural poison. And it's gone. It must be found. -I'll have it found after lunch. Now. -Yes, Mr. Director. AA2 in carrot juice? Your carrot juice. The parsnip pulp has a little more flavor. The cook seasoned it with caraway seeds. She is still in danger. Ms. Roitman. That poisoner strikes again. Mark my words. Good morning. The parsnip pulp has a little more flavor. The cook put caraway seeds in it. -Beautiful. She is still in danger. Ms. Roitman. That poisoner strikes again. Mark my words. Something is going on. I just feel something is going on. Is that old head wound playing up again? -Yes. He itches. There must be a pharmacy that sells ricin. I've been through them all. -Search tomorrow. Good night. What about you? -I said: Good night. You could also use some sleep. -Not when I'm itchy. See you tomorrow, Burton. There is definitely something going on. You remove the safety catch, you aim and pull the trigger. It must be very easy, but never mind. I can't sleep if only that sucker of a Hook protects you. I don't want anything more happening to you. Okay, Roger. You're right. -Thank you. And now sleep well. Ms. Roitman, Captain J. Barker Rynde. Private detective. My ticket. Speciality: Divorces? I'm keeping an eye on someone I suspect. He could show up at any moment. If I take my hand away, you won't make a sound. ok? I am your friend. Pretend you are sleeping. Do not be afraid. Ryan is here. Do not be afraid. It's me. I'm keeping an eye on someone I suspect. He could strike at any moment. Do not be afraid. Rumbelow is here. We lie down and wait. You know what I mean. Don't resist. Throw that bat away. - Throw yours away. I warn you. Drop that bat. Just drop them both. Aim and pull the trigger. I direct. Stand still. -He's a hit man. You rented that bat, right? -Nonsense. I am a member of the private investigators association. I can prove it. May I? Watch. -That seems right. Would you deny that Margaret Clifford was your patient? And that in her file it says: AA2 in carrot juice. 2x a day... final stage? And is AA2 a deadly poison? AA is apple cider vinegar. 2 means: two tricks. Who is there? Oh, it's you. -Everything quiet? As in the grave. You can go. I'll take your shift. If you say it... -And I say it. Good night. Sorry. Good night. You're not going to tell this any more, are you? 2000 is at stake. I say nothing. The police must not interfere with my investigation. It's my research. I'm doing an investigation. -Can't you work together? I'm a pro. I can't work with amateurs. It's my civic duty to arrest the killer. 10 percent. - I was just about to offer you that. 10 percent is reasonable for the small contribution you will make. That small contribution will come from you. There's someone outside. -Look, Rumbelow. Go. I will stay here. A man in a raincoat walks around the back. I'm calling the police. -Did you forget that 2000? There is a man outside. -There are two inside. Not for 10 percent. 25. -50-50. 50-50? Agreed to meet. I'm sure something is going on. I did it. -How so? It's Hook. You did it. -You too. Amateur. -Running. That hurts. - You have to. I assure you... that this healing oil really helps. I don't know a better remedy. Have you found that poison book yet? -No. YOU? Did Miss Roitman see anything? -No. And not heard. I do. There were two. When I walked back... I heard someone say something to another. What then? -Just one word: Run. In your places. Run. One two three four. I said: Rest. Don't: Collapse. Don't help, ladies. Just let him get up on his own. There he is again. Before we take root: Run. Come on. Got something in your eye, Mr Rynde? Hook is behind you. To the forest. To the forest. Follow me. Who found him? -Captain Rynde. That strange man who complained about his room. Where is he? -He's out grooming. I have to thank him. I don't see him anywhere. -Not really? Isn't he waiting for us? I knew it. Unnecessary panic. -Excuse me? The inspector cannot possibly know what hit him. And you sneak up on windows. All unnecessary panic. I can explain everything, Inspector. Off, Junia. Can I have a word with you, Mr Rynde? Would you like to go for a walk with Junia? Pardon? Are we going out? Boyfriends? Are we going out? Come on. That brooch is an heirloom. I am very grateful to you. Would you like to sit down? -Thank you. The stones are real. He is very precious. My husband lost it when he wanted to have it cleaned. I had already given up hope. It was six months ago. Where did you find him? -On the terrain. It looks good if you consider that it has been there for half a year. And, huh? You would think someone lost it yesterday. Very weird. Thank you very much, Mr. Rynde. Just hold on. Open the window, Captain Rynde. ah. The classic love triangle. It's time for some night work. Do you hear that? That dog knows I'm outside. He wanted to bite me. -If I don't get meat soon... i will do that too. This is ridiculous. Sister Fallows isn't... She is. -Horrible. With the director? He's the age for it. -Stop... with those allegations. -Hold that ladder. Rita? I know her closely. -That'll be fine. Hold that ladder. And you shouldn't get there. What's up? You wouldn't wear that brooch here. -I said I was sorry. And just that night. He could have been found at the chalet. I wanted to wish you luck. -It was dangerous. I like danger. -You're not sitting with my wife. Neither will you for long. -I won't believe it until it comes. The old one is dead. You get the money. Just think about that. Then you don't know Rachel. I've been dancing to her tune for ten years. You're not going to back down, are you? -Of course not. Did you keep that package well? -Naturally. Stop worrying. I will wait. What goes up... must come down again. It must also hurt. Any idea who it was? He was at a sister's window. -A spy. No, it was one of your guests. He stole my chocolate. Do you know anything about the old lady's new will? That's what the lawyer was talking about. We haven't found it yet. What do you want? -The commissioner on the phone. What was he supposed to do? -He hoped we were getting along. What else? -Well... Come on. What else? -I had to say... Come on, dickbag. What else? You seem to be constantly unconscious. Unconscious? If I get my hands on that joker... Rumbelow usually does this, right? Is he hiding? He is busy. That must feel better. Now the circulator. -Is that really necessary? Just hold on. Yes, it is here. It's for you. -For me? Rumbelow. And? Excuse me. My apologies. I'm concerned, Captain Rynde. -About that incident in your room? No, that's not it. I want to ask you for advice. Is that right? You name it. You mean it. -Maybe it's nothing. Should I tell Mr Hook? -No. He can't handle this case. Leave it to me. Do not you worry. I will proceed with the utmost discretion. Thank you. Charming girl. Address me as Captain. I'll take over. Traitor. Leave without saying anything. I said, 'psst.' -And what does that mean? 2000 is at stake. One of us had to escape. You of course. It was a painful decision, but I have nothing to blame myself for. Then why are you avoiding me? -Duty called. I suspected that beer is being smuggled in. And yes. I washed it away. - Senseless swine. Too bad I haven't seen any evidence of your idiotic suspicions. They were both there. And they weren't reading a good book. I do not believe it. -Then I'll tell you one more thing. He persuaded Mrs Clifford to invest money. That doesn't make him a murderer. -Guard. She changed her mind. But before she could instruct her solicitor, she was dead. What now? -Little Rita offers the solution. He asked about a package. If she had kept it well. Tonight you go to her room and steal it. And you? -I'll lure the lady. What do you know about enticing ladies? You are a misogynist. What is that? -You hate women. I hate getting up too, but I'm not bedridden. I don't like it. Can you distract her long enough? Rather, the problem is getting rid of her again. Like Caesar I come, I see and I conquer. Ok�, Caesar. Julian? Julian. Who is there? It's me. What's up? You? -What is wrong with me? That note was from me. -It said 'J' underneath. That's right. The J of Jereboam. -Jereboam? J. Barker Rynde. Captain. At your service. All the way. Are you one of those? Many things are not on the menu here. I, among others. -You don't understand. I'm not like that. -I hope so. Do you believe in love at first sight? Something like instant coffee? I am a simple man. I have adored you from afar for some time. The further the better. -I came and saw you conquer. To catch. -You can't go yet. If you come closer, I'll rake your teeth. castor bean? Naturally. On the site itself. Come on. I thought she had you. -Not thanks to you. Look. And look again. And look. RICINUS - Natural poison Good morning. The morning bath will be canceled due to the frost. You won't find anything to eat there, feathered friend. You're walking. They seem crazy. What are you doing there? Dr Crossley. Good morning. And you haven't seen anything? Only the doctor. - Pass the salt. And you didn't find anything? He was stabbed in the back with a long, thin object. I didn't find anything. - Pass the pepper. They bring this from the desk. You have to be in a tent like this. Delicious. What were you doing by the pool? -The morning bath. Not today. It was cancelled. You get caught at a corpse and say you washed your underpants. Your defense is very thin. Just like the ice. Hand me the bread. We always get so good food. The prisoners too. And the butter. No, the butter. Foreign. A murder takes place the day you arrive. You go swimming in the freezing cold and another murder takes place. You'll be happy if you can get out of here. It makes you hungry anyway. There's still plenty. -I'm not hungry. You don't peek into girls' bedrooms, do you? And you didn't commit two murders? All right then. Get out. Remember this well: Wherever you are and whatever you do, I'm watching you. Naturally. Roger's R. You must come up with something better. That R belongs to his wife Rachel, but also to his girlfriend Rita. Wait a second. It could be Hook. Distort your voice. Hello? -Captain Rynde? Miss Frances? -I need to see you. That's a bit risky. I'm being watched. But it's important. You know that oak tree behind the chalet? I'll see you there. - We can risk that. Goodbye. Did you call someone? -The counter. To ask about the mail. I need fresh air. Do you want to take me? Can you handle that? -I can't stand this any longer. I think it's awful here. -I understand. This is fine. I'd like to be alone for a while. Do you mind? - Are you okay? Horatio will take care of me. -Don't overdo it. I'll come get you in ten minutes. Are you there? -We're here. Stop. What can I do for you? I'm afraid. I can't sleep. I'm even afraid of Roger. Whoever it is, he wants to kill me. About our corpses. After what happened to Dr Crossley, I need to talk to the inspector. I have to tell him you hit him. Please. Do not. We've almost solved the case. -We'll have the killer at ten o'clock. Why do you say that? -I have something to say, don't I? Do you know who it is then? We have a knot. Someone is coming. You have until ten o'clock. Go away, Horatio. Horatio, come here. I will get him. - He'll figure it out on his own. It's no trouble. Come here. Come here now. Come here, beast. Here's the little beauty. There must be a cat. -I'm cold. Would you take me back to the chalet? This is the gallows oak. This is where they used to hang people. I did not know that. -The good old days. Bloodthirsty cop. He would hang you for wrong parking. Get out of this twisted oak. Four more hours. Where is Rumbelow? When she's no longer in mourning, I want to talk to her about that dog. We only have four hours left. -I have a plan. Sit down. The killer kills for the knot. If he knows who has it... Do not you understand that? Ace. You. We say to Roger, Rachel and Rita... that you found that button somewhere. Only the killer knows where. Only he wants to come and kill you. Kill me? -Yes. Where's your walkie-talkie? Are you joking? -I'll take this. You take the channel. If the killer wants to kill you, call me and I'll be right there. Have you gone mad? -I've already briefed Ms. Frances. Light her out. -The plan is already in effect. I've already notified the others. -Really? The unsub knows I've got the knot. -Precisely. I'm just a decoy duck. - Do you understand now? You are my last patient. In five minutes in the steam room. And act a little natural. What a devilishly clever plan, huh? Devils, yes. Captain Ryan. Come to the treatment room immediately. Johnson. About that obituary. Make sure it is only posted once. Add: No flowers, please. -Excuse me. And: Rest in peace. Do you want to go in or out? Such a steam bath works wonders. Come with me. This way. Are you OK? -Good, Richards. The R of Richards. The couch is ready. Just go inside. Test. One, two, who cares. Three four... Rumbelow, there's someone here. He comes at me. Rumbelow, he's coming at me. Rumbelow, help. Rumbelow. What is it? Rumbelow. -Finally, there you are again. If you pass out, when you see me, how can it be? Cognac. -You need shock treatment. Don't you think I'm shocked enough already? Yes? My patient? Donuts? Sausage rolls? Gin? Where? In the summer cottage? Thank you. I'll be right back. -You can't leave me like this. If you need help, just call. - Rumbelow. Come back. Do not leave me alone. Fire alarm. I smell smoke. will you receive me? Fire. That was a fake phone call. Donuts, sausage rolls, gin. I will teach him. Everyone leaves the building, Rumbelow. Everyone leaves the building. I'm trapped. Who is there? Roger? Rita? Rachel? Richards? I've never been so happy to see someone. That is mutual. - Loosen those ties. A moment. Where's the knot? -In my pocket. Since when are you walking again? Captain, the R of Roitman. Yours? -Mine. The doctor saw injection marks on my arm. And he found that poison book in my room and decided to blackmail me. Are you still following it? And you are still a pro. He had to. He knew how I killed Mrs Clifford. Did you kill Mrs Clifford too? - I poisoned us both. You haven't poisoned yourself, have you? -Yes. I was already immune. I injected a small dose... so that the effect was comparable to a serious hangover. Smart, huh? Awesome. But why do you do such a thing? Roger and I wanted to get married. She wanted to check my background. It wouldn't stand up to that. And then you came. And now you go again. What are you doing? -I'm going to shock you one more time. Got you. Now only some water and then we get a short circuit. Short circuit? If they find you, I'll be back in my wheelchair. Funny how one leads to the other. I wanted to commit one murder. And now I'm on my third. Well, that's life. Exciting, huh? Help. Help, Rumbelow. Bye, Captain. Help. Law enforcement. Inspector Hook. Just look. Amateur. You arrested her in Hinton. An ordinary village cop? Congratulations. With me? Reasonable. According to circumstances. Thank you. Day. That is then resolved. -I'm not sure. She is the killer. But I want to know who beat me up. Very annoying, Inspector. About the reward. Good of you to bring it up. -We don't want to seem too greedy. I have a surprise for you. We found that will. Do you know who she left all her money to? Doggy, do you need someone to take care of you? An adapted diet. -Steak. Parsnip Puree. -Grilled salmon. And now sleep well. Horatio. Stop. Come here.
