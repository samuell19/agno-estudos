Or a merry Christmas. THE DIFFERENCE IS THE BONUS CHECK I'LL GET YOU FOR EARLY DELIVERY. THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT. END OF THE WEEK. I WANT A MERRY CHRISTMAS, TOO. NAT SOUNDED HAPPY. OH, DON'T GET CUTE. HALLE DOWNING. YOU'RE NEXT. WHAT DID I DO? NOTHING. THAT'S THE PROBLEM. YOU KNOW I'M BLOCKED. YOU'RE FIVE MONTHS LATE. YOU OWE THE PUBLISHER AT LEAST AN OUTLINE, OR... THEY WILL DISCONTINUE THE "CHRISTINA KICK-BUTT" SERIES. "DISCONTINUE"? BUT WHY? FANBASE IS ALL OVER SOCIAL MEDIA ANXIOUS FOR THE NEXT BOOK. THAT MAKES PUBLISHERS, WELL, REACT. THERE'S ONLY ONE FOSTER KID SUPERHERO RIGHT NOW, AND IF YOU WON'T DELIVER HER, SOMEONE ELSE WILL CREATE ONE. LOOK AT ALL THE WORK YOU'VE DONE. YOU DON'T WANT IT TO END, DO YOU? YOU KNOW I DON'T. THEN COME UP WITH A BOOK SO GOOD THEY'LL WANT MORE... AND I WILL BE REMINDING YOU OF THE DEADLINE. MM-HMM. OKAY. GOOD AFTERNOON. THANK YOU FOR COMING IN. WE ARE FINALIZING THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE BUSINESS ASSETS IN MR. MOORE'S ESTATE, AND THERE'S ONLY ONE OUTSTANDING ISSUE TO RESOLVE. AS HIS WIDOW AND HIS MOTHER, I THINK WE NEED YOUR HELP. WHAT'S THAT? WELL... HIS DAUGHTER. WHAT HAS TIFFANY DONE? NOT TIFFANY. CANDACE. YOU KNOW WHERE SHE IS! YES... OH! BUT DUE TO ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE AND RULES GOVERNING HER CLOSED ADOPTION, I CAN ONLY SHARE THAT THOUGH HE WASN'T SUPPOSED TO, MR. MOORE DID LOCATE HER. LEGALLY, SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO INITIATE CONTACT, BUT WITH THIS NOW BEING AN ESTATE MATTER, HOWARD AUTHORIZED OUR OFFICE TO INFORM HER OF HER PENDING INTERESTS. NOW, WE HAVEN'T RECEIVED A RESPONSE FROM HER, SO I THINK WE NEED A PERSONAL TOUCH. SHE'S A STRANGER. WE... WE DON'T KNOW WHO SHE IS OR WHAT SHE'S CAPABLE OF. MAYBE HER NOT RESPONDING IS A SIGN TO JUST LEAVE IT ALONE. BUT SHE'S ALSO MY FIRST GRANDCHILD, AND I'M NOT MISSING ANY MORE OF HER LIFE IF THERE'S A CHANCE TO REACH HER. WHAT DO YOU NEED ME TO DO? FAN MAIL. FAN MAIL, FAN MAIL. "LAW FIRM." "AN ESTATE-RELATED MATTER. PLEASE USE THIS TEST TO CONFIRM LEGAL RELATIONSHIP." THIS REQUIRES CHOCOLATE. "I THINK YOU ARE MY GRANDDAUGHTER." COME IN. HEY. HEY. AH, MIRACLE WORKER. STILL BLOCKED, HUH? THIS ISN'T HALLE I KNOW. SHE WOULD DARE SOMEONE TO TAKE HER SERIES AWAY AND MAKE THEM REGRET TRYING TO. UM, LATELY I DON'T FEEL LIKE MY USUAL SOUTHSIDE SELF. OH, SHE'S STILL IN THERE. YOU JUST NEED TO GET ANGRY. HOW MANY TIMES DID I HAVE TO MOVE YOU BECAUSE YOU STOOD UP FOR YOURSELF TOO WELL? WELL, THAT'S WHY YOU'RE ALWAYS MY FAVORITE SOCIAL WORKER. YOU ACTED AND ASKED QUESTIONS LATER. WELL... HELPING KIDS FINDING WHERE THEY BELONG WAS MY PURPOSE, LIKE I KNOW WRITING THESE BOOKS IS YOURS. LOOK HOW MANY CHILDREN THEY HELP IN AND OUT OF FOSTER CARE. WHAT DOES A SINGLE 30-SOMETHING THAT'S AN-AGED OUT FOSTER KID KNOW ABOUT ANYTHING? HALLE, YOU ARE A SUCCESSFUL AUTHOR OF CHILDREN'S BOOKS. THAT'S THE RESULT OF CHOICES AND TIMING. TO GET WHERE YOU ARE, YOU MADE SOME GOOD CHOICES AT THE RIGHT TIME. "CHOICES AND TIMING." THAT'S THE WAY OUT OF MY WRITER'S BLOCK? THAT'S PART OF IT, BUT MAYBE THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE YOU HAVE FOR THIS BOOK IS THAT YOU HAVE MORE QUESTIONS THAN ANSWERS ON WHAT YOU WANT TO WRITE ABOUT. ABOUT THAT... THESE CAME IN THE MAIL. WHAT ARE THOSE? ANSWERS. THEY CAME WITH LETTERS FROM AN ATTORNEY'S OFFICE AND SOMEONE THAT MAY BE MY GRANDMOTHER. THIS IS ABOUT SOMEONE'S ESTATE. I KNOW. I'VE NEVER BEEN BRAVE ENOUGH TO TAKE ONE OF THOSE TESTS. I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY. THEN MAYBE YOU NEED TO DECIDE WHICH YOU'RE MORE AFRAID OF. KNOWING... OR NOT KNOWING. ALL RIGHT, INSPIRATION. COME FIND ME. "HELLO, HALLE," WE FOUND YOU! I DON'T HAVE YOUR NUMBER, SO PLEASE CALL ME. I CAN'T WAIT TO MEET YOU! "YOUR GRANDMOTHER." UH-UH. I NEED SUGAR FIRST. HELLO? IS SOMEONE THERE? HI. THIS... UH, THIS IS HALLE. OH, IT'S SO GOOD TO HEAR YOUR VOICE. THIS IS YOUR GRANDMOTHER. HI. I TOOK THAT DNA TEST. THAT NOTE WAS FROM MY GRANDMOTHER. IT'S SO WEIRD TO SAY THAT OUT LOUD. SHE INVITED ME TO SPEND CHRISTMAS THIS YEAR WITH HER FAMILY. YOU MEAN, "YOUR FAMILY." THEY CONTACTED ME BECAUSE MY FATHER DIED A FEW MONTHS AGO. SWEETIE, I... I'M SO SORRY. I'D ALWAYS WONDERED ABOUT FINDING MY PARENTS. I HADN'T THOUGHT I'D BE TOO LATE TO MEET THEM. HALLE. HMM? YOU'RE A BIG SISTER, TOO. I AM. I HAVE TWO YOUNGER BROTHERS AND A YOUNGER SISTER. THEY DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT ME UNTIL THE DNA TEST RESULTS CAME IN. IN ONE DAY, I GOT MORE ANSWERS ABOUT MYSELF THAN I HAVE MY WHOLE LIFE. CHOICES AND TIMING. WHEN BOTH ARE RIGHT... IT'S MAGICAL... IT'S MAGICAL. IS THIS TRIP A GOOD TIME TO TELL THEM ABOUT MY WORK? I WANT THEM TO ACCEPT ME FOR ME... NOT BECAUSE I'M "H.D. MADISON." WELL, THEY INVITED YOU IN WITHOUT KNOWING WHO YOU ARE, SO JUST GO WITH YOUR INSTINCTS ON. SPEAKING OF WHICH... YOU KNOW I HAVE THE INSTINCT TO SNOOP THROUGH YOUR THINGS WHEN YOU'RE NOT LOOKING. WHAT HAVE YOU DONE? I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND, BUT I TOOK IT UPON MYSELF TO CONTACT YOUR BROTHER, SINCE I WON'T BE HERE. GOT YOU A NEW PHONE FOR YOUR CHRISTMAS PRESENT TO FINALLY BRING YOU INTO THIS CENTURY, AND THE FIRST MESSAGE ON IT IS FROM HIM. I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER WHY WE STOPPED SPEAKING. MAYBE THAT MEANS IT'S THE PERFECT TIME TO START AGAIN. THESE YEARS ARE PRECIOUS, AREN'T THEY? SO, YOU'RE CAN HAVE THE NEIGHBORHOOD CHRISTMAS WE ALWAYS HAVE, BUT I THOUGHT MAYBE WE BOTH COULD USE SOME FAMILY THIS YEAR. HI, SABRINA. ♪ I WARNED YOU ♪ ♪ I WILL BE CHECKING IN ♪ I'M JUST HEADING OUT OF TOWN TO FIND THAT CHRISTMAS INSPIRATION YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT. OH? WHERE ARE YOU GOING? NEW ORLEANS. YOU MUST BE HALLE. HOW CAN YOU TELL? I'M DEVIN. YOUR MEMAW SENT ME. WELCOME TO NEW ORLEANS. I DIDN'T CHECK THE WEATHER. OH, YOU DIDN'T? WELL, ARE YOU NERVOUS? SO NERVOUS.

THE FOOD ISN'T EVEN READY YET. THIS HOUSE IS AMAZING. MY HUSBAND'S FAMILY WERE REAL ESTATE MOGULS BEFORE IT WAS A THING, BUT THIS HOUSE WAS SPECIAL. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR INVITING ME, ESPECIALLY AT CHRISTMAS. THIS IS YOUR FATHER. MY SON LOVED CHRISTMAS. IT WAS HIS FAVORITE TIME OF THE YEAR SINCE HE WAS A LITTLE BOY. MINE, TOO. MAYBE A LITTLE MORE NOW. OH... OH, WELL, LET'S, UH... LET'S GET YOU TO YOUR ROOM. JUST FOLLOW ME. THIS FOOD LOOKS GOOD. JOIN US, PLEASE. OKAY. WAIT. NO, THAT'S DADDY'S! OH. HOW ABOUT I SIT NEXT TO YOU? WE WAITED FOR YOU. THANKS. OH NO, NO... TSS, TSS. OH, OKAY. OKAY. THANK YOU FOR THE FOOD WE'RE ABOUT TO RECEIVE, AND THANK YOU FOR BRINGING OUR HALLE TO JOIN US AT THIS TABLE. AMEN. - AMEN. - AMEN. - AMEN. - AMEN. SO, HALLE, HIT US WITH YOUR STORY. MM-MM, NO. WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE AN INTERROGATION OVER LUNCH. WE CAN'T GET SOME BASIC INFO? MM-MM, MM-MM. WHAT DO YOU DO? I, UH... I WORK IN PUBLISHING. DID YOU GROW UP IN CHICAGO? YES, BORN AND RAISED. YOU PLAY ANY SPORTS? NOT REALLY. WHAT ABOUT YOU? I WANT TO PLAY FOOTBALL. GO, SAINTS! NO, HE'S BASICALLY A CHESS PRODIGY, I PREFER HE FOCUS ON THAT. OH. HE PLAYS ANYONE, ANYWHERE. SO, YOU'RE A GENIUS. WELL, WHAT ABOUT YOU TWO? WELL, I'M A PUBLICIST IN L.A. I ONLY WORK WITH THE BIGGEST CELEBRITIES. I'M IN L.A., TOO. I'M AN ENTREPRENEUR. YEAH, WELL, NONE OF US KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE ENTREPRENEURING IN. MAYBE STEPMOMMY-DEAREST SHOULD GO NEXT. SHE WORKED AT DADDY'S COMPANY. WERE YOU A RECEPTIONIST? OR A SECRETARY? I WAS VICE PRESIDENT OF MARKETING. I HIRED THE PUBLICIST THAT, UH, PRINCESS SPOILED HERE IS TRYING TO BECOME. NOW, THAT'S ENOUGH OF THAT. SO, DO YOU ALL HAVE MANY CHRISTMAS TRADITIONS? DOESN'T EVERYBODY? YES, WE DO, AND WE WANT YOU TO EXPERIENCE ALL OF THEM WITH US. THERE ARE PARTIES. ONE HERE, AND THE ANNUAL FETE QUARTIER. IT'S WONDERFUL. MUSIC, DANCING. SO MUCH FOOD AND EVERYTHING. TOO MUCH, HONESTLY. UH, DO YOU USUALLY SPEND CHRISTMAS WITH YOUR ADOPTIVE FAMILY? NO, I WAS ADOPTED AS A BABY, BUT I GREW UP IN FOSTER CARE. WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN THAT FAR YET. YOU DON'T HAVE ANY PARENTS? I'VE HAD LOTS OF THEM, AND A REALLY GREAT SOCIAL WORKER NAMED EUGENE. WE'RE STILL CLOSE. HMM. THIS FOOD IS REALLY GOOD. YEAH. MM-HMM. ALWAYS. OH, GOD. I CAN HEAT SOMETHING UP FOR YOU, IF YOU LIKE. JUST LOOKING FOR SOMETHING SWEET. OKAY. WHAT DO YOU HAVE A TASTE FOR? SOMETHING WITH SUGAR IN IT, ON IT, AND WITH IT. WITH IT, OKAY. TELL YOU WHAT... I GOT AN IDEA. COME WITH ME. OKAY. SO, WHAT'S CHRISTMAS LIKE IN CHICAGO? COLD. SNOW IS ALREADY ON THE GROUND. SOME NIGHTS, IT'S WHAT YOU WOULD IMAGINE A WINTER WONDERLAND IS. IS THAT SNOWMEN IN BIG PUFFY COATS? I DON'T KNOW ANY OTHER KIND OF CHRISTMAS. I'VE SPENT ALL OF THEM THERE. THAT'S WHY I WANT TO KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT CHRISTMAS HERE. WELL, I CAN TELL YOU, FOR THE MOORES, THERE'S PLENTY OF TRADITIONS AND EVENTS EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK FOR CHRISTMAS. HMM. NOW, AS FOR ME, I'M COOKING FOR THEIR ANNUAL REVEILLON DINNER FOR THE COMPANY EXECUTIVES. WHAT'S A "REVEILLON DINNER"? IT'S A FESTIVE DINNER MEANT TO AWAKEN THE CHRISTMAS SPIRIT. IT'S A VERY OLD TRADITION HERE IN NEW ORLEANS. AND YOU GO TO ALL THESE EVENTS? WELL, I GO TO THE ONES I WANT TO AND COOK FOR THE ONES THEY HOST. BUT CHRISTMAS DAY? MM-HMM? ALWAYS WITH THE FAMILY. OH. WIFE AND KIDS? PARENTS AND SIBLINGS. WHAT ABOUT YOU? YOU EVER GET A CHANCE TO SPEND THOSE... WINTER WONDERLAND MOMENTS WITH ANYONE SPECIAL? ONLY MY FORMER SOCIAL WORKER, EUGENE. SO, LET ME ASK YOU THIS... HOW ARE YOU HANDLING FINDING OUT ABOUT YOUR NEW FAMILY? NOT KNOWING WAS MUCH EASIER. EASIER, YEAH. BUT BETTER? I'M NOT SURE YET. DID YOU GUYS HAVE FUN? HE INTRODUCED ME TO BEIGNETS. OOH. HE'S SUCH A FINE YOUNG MAN. ALWAYS HAS BEEN. IS EVERYTHING OKAY? OH... YOU LOOK SO MUCH LIKE YOUR FATHER. I'M SORRY. OH, BABY, NO. YOU LOOK LIKE MY SON. PLEASE DON'T EVER FEEL SORRY ABOUT THAT. WHEN YOU'RE READY... CALL ME "MEMAW." GOOD NIGHT, BABY. GOOD NIGHT. EVERY YEAR, THE CHAMPION HERE REPRESENTS THEIR SCHOOL AT THE CITY-WIDE CHESS SLAM THAT'S IN A FEW DAYS. OH, OKAY. IS HE THAT GOOD? OH, HE IS. HE HAS A COACH AND EVERYTHING. I JUST WANT HIM TO HAVE THE BEST LIFE. MM-HMM. NOW, WITH HIS FATHER GONE... IS ANY THE FAMILY HELPING YOU? OH, I THANK GOD FOR MEMAW. I MEAN, SHE'S A LIFESAVER. BUT TIFFANY, SHE'S WRAPPED UP IN HER OWN DADDY ISSUES, AND GLENN JUST FOLLOWS HER LEAD. HAVE YOU ASKED THEM FOR THEIR HELP? HAVE THEY OFFERED? GOT IT. WELL, WHAT ABOUT HOWARD? WOULD YOU TELL ME ABOUT HIM? HE WAS HILARIOUS. OH, WE LAUGHED SO MUCH OVER THE YEARS. HE WAS JUST SO KIND. HE REALLY CARED ABOUT PEOPLE. DID HOWARD TELL YOU ABOUT ME, OR DID YOU FIND OUT WITH EVERYONE ELSE? HE DID... A FEW YEARS AFTER WE GOT MARRIED. YOU KNOW, AFTER WE HAD DREW, HE... IT FELT LIKE HE WAS HOLDING BACK. UNTIL I FINALLY ASKED HIM ABOUT IT, AND TOLD ME. HONESTLY, I DON'T... THINK HE EVER GOT OVER YOUR MOTHER AND WHAT HAPPENED. WHY DO YOU THINK HE DIDN'T TELL TIFFANY AND GLENN ABOUT ME? I THINK HE WANTED TO, BUT HE WAS WAITING FOR THIS PERFECT MOMENT. THERE REALLY IS NO PERFECT MOMENT FOR THIS, IS THERE? MM-MM. AND I WOULD APPRECIATE IT IF YOU WOULDN'T SAY ANYTHING TO TIFFANY AND GLENN ABOUT ME KNOWING. EVEN THOUGH THEY KEEP THEIR DISTANCE, I'LL ALWAYS BE PROTECTIVE OF THEM. THAT MUST BE REALLY HARD ON YOU. SO, WHAT'S NEXT FOR YOU? UH, I'M WORKING ON A BOOK FOR FEMALE EXECUTIVES ABOUT WHAT TO DO TO PLAN PROPERLY... YOU KNOW, FOR CAREER AND FAMILY. SO, YOU WANTED TO GO BACK TO WORK? MY ORIGINAL PLAN WAS MONTHS, AND IT TURNED INTO YEARS. SO, PLAN FOR WHEN THE PLANS CHANGE. BASICALLY. MM. WANT ME TO TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT YOU'VE WRITTEN SO FAR? OH, THAT'S RIGHT. YOU WORK FOR A PUBLISHER. YEAH. DOING WHAT, EXACTLY? OH, UM, PROOFREADING. I... I PROOF MANUSCRIPTS. OH, WELL, IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'D KNOW WHAT YOU DO. WELL, WHEN I'M READY TO PROOF, I KNOW WHO TO CALL. AND WHEN YOU'RE READY TO BE HONEST WITH ME ABOUT WHAT YOU DO, YOU KNOW WHERE TO FIND ME. HEY, BIG MAMA. WHAT UP, BIG SIS? WHY DOES EVERY NICKNAME FOR THE WOMEN IN YOUR LIFE INCLUDE THE WORD "BIG" IN IT? I MEAN... YOU KNOW... Y'ALL SHOULD SHOW HALLE HERE SOME GOOD SOUTHERN HOSPITALITY AND SHOW HER AROUND TOWN. WE WOULD, BUT GLENN AND I WERE JUST HEADED OUT SOMEWHERE. MM-HMM. IT'S FINE. I'M TIRED, AND I'VE GOT TO GET SOME WORK DONE. OH, NO, NO. TAKE HALLE. I MEAN, YOU GUYS SHOULD START DOING THINGS TOGETHER... YOU KNOW, SINCE THE DUO IS NOW A TRIO, AND ALL. FINE. BUT YOU TWO ARE GONNA NEED TO PUT ON SOME NICER CLOTHES. SHE BROUGHT THAT CAR TO SHOW MEMAW HER FIRST GROWN-UP PURCHASE. SHE KEEPS IT SPOTLESS. THIS FOOD BETTER MAKE ME FORGIVE HOW FAST YOU DROVE THROUGH EVERYTHING I'LL HAVE TO SEE AGAIN. AH-AH-AH, YOU MIGHT BE FROM CHI-TOWN, BUT DON'T UNDERESTIMATE NEW ORLEANS CUISINE, BIG SIS. GLENN, DON'T MAKE ME AGREE WITH YOUR STEPMOTHER. ENOUGH WITH THE "BIGS." LEAVE IT IN FRONT. SO, YOU HUNG OUT WITH JOAN THIS MORNING. HOW WAS THAT? NOT BAD. WE TALKED. JOAN'S HOT AND COLD. SHE STARTS OFF HOT, BUT AFTER ALL THESE YEARS, SHE'S JUST COLD TO US. HOW DID SHE GO FROM HOT TO COLD? WHEN HER AND DADDY GOT MARRIED, SHE TRIED WITH US. IT WAS LIKE WE WERE A FAMILY. BUT THEN SHE HAD DREW, AND WE WENT FROM BEING HER KIDS TO BEING HER STEPKIDS. MM. THE FIRST TIME SHE INTRODUCED US LIKE THAT IN A STORE, I HID IT, BUT I CRIED THE WHOLE WAY HOME. MM-HMM. AND IT'S CHILDISH, BUT I'VE BEEN DONE EVER SINCE. YEAH. IT FEELS LIKE WE USED TO BE HERE ALL THE TIME WHEN WE WERE KIDS, BUT AFTER A WHILE... IT JUST FELT LIKE WE WERE IN THE WAY. HAVE YOU EVER TOLD HER HOW YOU'VE FELT ALL THESE YEARS? I MEAN, WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO. PARENTS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE CONSISTENT... EVEN THE "STEP" ONES. YEAH, WHATEVER SHE DID OR DIDN'T DO TO BE MORE INVOLVED IN OUR LIVES, IT WASN'T ENOUGH. WITH DAD GONE, IT JUST FEELS LIKE IT'S TOO LATE. COMING FROM EXPERIENCE, IT'S NEVER TOO LATE. WHAT ABOUT DREW? DO YOU SPEND MUCH TIME WITH HIM? SHE IS A HELICOPTER. WE SEE DREW AT THE HOUSE, BUT REALLY, IT'S SHEER MEMAW WHO'S TAKING CARE OF HIM. MM-HMM. TRY ASKING TO DO MORE. I MEAN, WHATEVER HAPPENED BEFORE, MAYBE YOU ALL CAN START AGAIN. I THINK SHE WANTS RELATIONSHIPS WITH ALL OF YOU. SHE JUST MAYBE DOESN'T KNOW WHERE TO START. WOW. YOU SPEAK JOAN. YEAH, TOO BAD SHE DIDN'T KNOW SHE HAD A LONG-LOST INTERPRETER OUT THERE. WELL, AC... "WELL," WHAT? NOTHING. REALLY. WAIT, DID JOAN KNOW ABOUT YOU? LOOK, I... I DIDN'T MEAN TO... OH, I HAVE HAD IT WITH HER. I... I... TIF, JUST... JUST SIT TIGHT. NOPE, I AM... YOU KNEW ABOUT HALLE, DIDN'T YOU? IT WASN'T MY SECRET TO TELL. WHY NOT? YOU WEIGHED IN ON EVERYTHING ELSE. NO, I NEVER WEIGHED IN ON DECISIONS THAT WEREN'T MY PLACE, AND THIS DEFINITELY WASN'T. YEAH, WELL, MAYBE YOU SHOULD HAVE. THAT'S ENOUGH. YOUR FATHER IS NOT HERE TO EXPLAIN WHY HE DID OR DID NOT DO SOMETHING, AND I WILL NOT HAVE YOU TEARING INTO JOAN ABOUT IT NOW. BUT, MEMAW, SHE KNEW ABOUT HALLE! SHE WAS HIS WIFE. I WAS HIS MOTHER. ARE YOU MAD AT ME, TOO? YOUR FATHER WASN'T PERFECT. HE DIDN'T KEEP THIS FROM YOU TO HURT YOU. QUITE THE OPPOSITE. LOOK, UM, SHE DIDN'T MEAN ANY OF THAT. WE WERE JUST CAUGHT OFF GUARD BY SOME SUPER-SECRET FAMILY TEA. AGAIN. I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT, GLENN. HEY, IS ANYONE INTERESTED IN LEARNING THE SICILIAN DEFENSE? MAYBE LATER. I NEED SOME AIR. I'M GONNA GO FOR A WALK... AND I HOPE I FIND AN ICE CREAM TRUCK. MAY I GO WITH HALLIE? PLEASE? OF COURSE. NOW, DON'T FORGET YOUR JACKET. UH-UH, T-T-THERE'S NO... YOU... I-I'LL TAKE CARE OF HER. YOU ALL JUST GO AHEAD. GO AHEAD. SO, WHERE DO YOU WANT TO GO? WELL, IF I WERE HOME, I'D GO FOR A WALK AND... HEY, HEY. HEY. WHERE YOU TWO HEADED? I DON'T KNOW. LET ME CHECK. WELL, LOOK, UM, CAN'T FORGET MY PHONE AGAIN. TELL YOU WHAT... LET ME GRAB IT. I'LL JOIN YOU. OKAY. ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? I'M JUST TRYING TO GET ON THE OTHER SIDE OF CHRISTMAS, AND HALLE'S NOT MAKING IT ANY EASIER. WELL, IS SHE SUPPOSED TO? SO, HALLE GETS WELCOMED AND I'M STILL THE EVIL STEPMOTHER, THANKS TO TIFFANY. I MEAN, I LOVE THEM, BUT FOR SOME REASON, THEY PULLED AWAY FROM ME AFTER DREW CAME ALONG. THEY DOTE ON HIM, SO... IT MUST BE ME, AND I DON'T KNOW WHY. WHY DON'T YOU ASK THEM? GLENN DOES WHATEVER TIFFANY TELLS HIM TO, AND YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WHENEVER WE SPEAK TO ONE ANOTHER. YOU KNOW I DON'T LIKE TO GET IN THE MIDDLE OF YOU AND THE KIDS. I'M ON ALL OF YOUR SIDES. WELL, I THINK THAT WE WISH SOMETIMES THAT YOU WOULD GET IN THE MIDDLE OF IT. MM. WHY DO YOU WORK FOR THIS... WHAT I'LL CALL "SPECIAL" FAMILY? WELL, THEY ARE SPECIAL, YOU KNOW? IN ALL OF THE BEST WAYS. ONE THING YOU'RE GONNA LEARN IS THAT FAMILIES ARE MESSY. OH, I KNOW. I'M AT A HOLIDAY EVENT WITH MY BROTHER WHO'S YOUNG ENOUGH TO BE MY SON. I HAVE ANOTHER BROTHER AND SISTER WHO I'M SURE WISH I DIDN'T EXIST, A STEPMOTHER WHO ALSO PROBABLY WISHES I DIDN'T EXIST, AND A GRANDMOTHER WHO'S JUST TRYING TO CLEAN UP HER SON'S MESS. YOU'RE NOT A MESS SHE'S TRYING TO CLEAN UP. SHE'S EXCITED YOU'RE HERE, AND IF YOU COULD HAVE HEARD HER PLANS FOR YOUR ARRIVAL... I KNOW SHE'S TRYING. YOU WERE COMING UP TO THE HOUSE WHEN WE KIDNAPPED YOU. WHAT DID WE KEEP YOU FROM DOING? WELL, I WAS PREPPING FOR TOMORROW... WELL, SINCE I'M GOING OUT TONIGHT. OH. SOMETHING FUN? YEAH, I'M GOING TO MY FAMILY'S HOLIDAY GUMBO COOK-OFF. I'M JUDGING THIS YEAR. THE COMPETITION IS REAL. YOU KNOW, THE WINNER GETS TO MAKE THIS YEAR'S BIG NEW YEAR'S PIE. HMM, THAT SOUNDS LIKE SOME REAL NEW ORLEANS TO ME. DOES IT? MM-HMM. UM, WOULD YOU WANT TO GO? WHAT DO YOU THINK? DREW, THAT'S LOVELY. WELL, IT'S FOR YOU. THANK YOU. I NEEDED THIS. LET'S GET YOU BACK HOME. OKAY. MERRY CHRISTMAS. MAYBE I SHOULD, LIKE, QUIT CHESS AND JUST FOCUS ON MY ART BUSINESS. I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW, LET'S JUST SEE... WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?! YOU LEFT HOURS AGO! I CALLED YOU! OH, I'M SORRY. UH, MY PHONE WAS ON SILENT. FIGURES. MOM, WE WERE AT THE MUSEUM, AND I MADE THIS FOR YOU. THANK YOU, BABY. CAN YOU TAKE IT INSIDE? O-OKAY. I'M SORRY I WORRIED YOU. WE WERE JUST GONNA TAKE A WALK, BUT THEN, WE... LOOK, IT WAS MY IDEA, OKAY? WE DECIDED TO TAKE HALLE ON A HORSE AND CARRIAGE. YOU KNOW I WOULD NEVER LET ANYTHING HAPPEN TO DREW. NO, I DON'T KNOW THAT. I'VE KNOWN YOU FOR FIVE MINUTES. MM. IS THE INVITATION TO THE PARTY STILL OPEN? OF COURSE, OF COURSE. OF COURSE. COME ON. WE'RE GONNA DO A SHOUTOUT TO NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA! WELL, NOW, WHO DO WE HAVE HERE? WELL, HELLO TO YOU, TOO. THIS MY SISTER, COREY. COREY, THIS IS HALLE. HI, HALLE. HI. I WAS ABOUT TO SEND THE DOGS TO COME AND FIND YOU. AUNT JULIA'S HAD HER FOOD HERE FOR 20 MINUTES, AND YOU KNOW SHE LOVES TO WIN AND HATES WAITING. TOLD YOU THE COMPETITION IS FIERCE. I SEE. I'M ALMOST AFRAID FOR YOU. I AM, TOO. MAYBE YOU SHOULD HELP HIM JUDGE IT. THAT WAY, THERE'S MORE THAN ONE OPINION. I ENTERED, SO I CAN'T. WHY NOT? I LOVE GUMBO. OH, WELL, BABY, MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME, BECAUSE ANY FRIEND OF DEVIN'S, THAT BEAU IS FAMILY TONIGHT. EVER BRING THE MOORES TO THIS? THEY'VE COME, BUT THEIR FATHER WOULD COME MORE OFTEN. HOW DID YOU TWO CONNECT? HIS COMPANY WAS A SPONSOR AT MY HIGH SCHOOL. I CREATED SOME RECIPES THAT HOWARD WAS SO IMPRESSED WITH, HE... HE DECIDED TO COVER MY TUITION FOR CULINARY SCHOOL. WOW. HE WAS A LIFE-CHANGING KIND OF GUY. OH, COMPLETELY. HE HIRED ME RIGHT AFTER I GRADUATED, AND I'VE BEEN TESTING OUT RECIPES ON THE MOORES EVER SINCE... HMM. FOR MY RESTAURANT I WANT TO OPEN SOMEDAY. OH, NICE. YEAH. UM... MAY I HAVE THIS DANCE? YEAH. DID I KEEP YOU UP AGAIN? OH, NO. COME, SIT WITH ME. I'M JUST LOOKING AT AN OLD PHOTO ALBUM FROM WHEN HOWARD WAS A CHILD. OH, WOW. LOOK. OH, MY GOODNESS. SO MUCH WAS SAID EARLIER. I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU WERE OKAY. I'M NOT SURE WHAT I'M FEELING. MM, ASK ME ANYTHING. DID YOU SUPPORT ME BEING GIVEN UP? HOWARD FELT HE WAS TOO YOUNG AND IMMATURE TO BE A FATHER. SO... I DIDN'T INTERFERE. MM-MM. SO, YOU NEVER SAW ME. NO PICTURES. IF I HAD SEEN YOU... I WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ABLE TO LET YOU GO. I WAS COMFORTED... BELIEVING THAT... YOU WERE ADOPTED INTO A GOOD FAMILY. I GET THAT. CHRISTINA, I'M TRYING TO SAVE YOU. I JUST... NEED TO FIND THE WORDS. OH, HEY! WANT TO PLAY WITH ME? SURE. I'LL SHOW YOU HOW BAD I AM. IS IT OKAY IF I ASKED YOU WHAT FOSTER CARE WAS LIKE? HMMM. WELL, THERE'S A BOOK SERIES CALLED "CHRISTINA KICK-BUTT"... I KNOW ABOUT CHRISTINA. WELL, CHRISTINA TALKS ABOUT ALL THE SKILLS SHE LEARNS AT HER GROUP HOMES. THAT'S WHAT IT WAS LIKE FOR ME. CHESS ISN'T A GAME ABOUT ANY ONE PIECE. EACH MOVE IS ABOUT ALL OF THE PIECES. THEY'RE CONNECTED. SO, WHEN YOU MOVE THE WHOLE BOARD AT ONCE, YOU'RE NOT JUST A PAWN ANYMORE. BE THE BOARD, A-AND NOT JUST A PIECE. HEY. I'LL BE TAKING YOU TO PRACTICE. GO AHEAD. I'LL KEEP STUDYING. I'LL BE CHECKING OUT THE VENUE ONCE I DROP OFF MY BABY BROTHER. OKAY, BYE. YOU'RE TAKING HIM TO PRACTICE? YEAH. YOU WERE RIGHT. WHEN I GOT BACK, I ASKED JOAN, AND SHE SAID, "OKAY." HE'S GONNA BREAK HIS NECK. WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! YOU'RE GONNA FALL. NO, HE WON'T. I'LL HELP HIM. SEE? SHE'S NOT SO BAD. PRACTICALLY HAVE TO FLY TO GET DREW TO PRACTICE ON TIME. NOT LIKE SHE WAS GONNA SPEED THE WHOLE WAY ANYWAY, RIGHT? LET ME SHOW YOU WHAT I DID. DON'T YOU FORGET NOTHING, ALL RIGHT? I'M NOT. YOU DON'T FORGET THIS INGREDIENT. YES. WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE? I HAVE A GINGERBREAD RECIPE, AND DEVIN IS PICKING UP SOME INGREDIENTS FOR ME. OH, YOU COOK DESSERTS, TOO. HALLE, WHAT DON'T YOU DO? JOAN, I'M SORRY ABOUT YESTERDAY. I SCREWED UP. AND ABOUT DREW. IT'S FINE. THE TWINS NEEDED TO KNOW THE TRUTH, AND DREW RAVED ABOUT HOW MUCH FUN YOU ALL HAD. SO, WE'RE OKAY? OF COURSE. I WAS THE NEW MEMBER OF THIS FAMILY ONCE. THE MOORES MAKE YOU EARN YOUR SPOT, ESPECIALLY TIFFANY. IT'LL TAKE YEARS... LIKE IT DID FOR ME... BUT YOU'LL SETTLE INTO A COMFORTABLE GROOVE EVENTUALLY. BUT YOU'LL GET THERE FASTER IF YOU'RE NOT KEEPING US AT A DISTANCE. THAT SUIT IS FIRE. OH, YOU LIKE IT? MM-HMM. I'M GOING TO A HOLIDAY LUNCHEON WITH THE WIVES OF THE EXECUTIVES AT THE COMPANY. THEY NEED TO KNOW I STILL GOT IT. OKAY. I WAS WONDERING WHEN YOU WOULD FINALLY CHECK IN. I'M SORRY. IT'S BEEN A WHIRLWIND SINCE I GOT HERE. IT'S GOOD. WELL, FIRST OF ALL, THIS PHONE IS A GAME-CHANGER. OH, I WOULD HAVE GOT YOU ONE A LONG TIME AGO IF I'D KNOWN ALL THAT. HEY, MY BROTHER AND HIS FAMILY ARE COMING OVER FOR CHRISTMAS. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO THANK YOU. GENE, HEARING ALL THIS GOOD NEWS IS THANK YOU ENOUGH. OH, ENOUGH ABOUT ME. TELL ME ABOUT NEW ORLEANS. ARE YOU GETTING THE ANSWERS TO HELP UNBLOCK YOU? NOT YET. I'M REALLY SCARED. I ONLY HAVE A FEW MORE DAYS TO GET THIS IN. I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA DO IF I CAN'T WRITE CHRISTINA ANYMORE. NEVER GON' HAPPEN. TELL ME SOMETHING HAPPIER. HOLD ON, GENE. COME IN! MEMAW WANTED ME TO MAKE SURE YOU WERE SET FOR TONIGHT'S REVEILLON DINNER. I'LL TRY YOU LATER. ALL RIGHT, BYE. OKAY, BYE. I'M SET. UH, MY DRESS IS IN THE CLOSET. OH, MAY I? GO AHEAD. OH, THIS DRESS! WOW, HALLE. I DIDN'T KNOW YOU CAME TO SLAY. BUT, YOU KNOW, TONIGHT'S PARTY IS AN UGLY CHRISTMAS SWEATER PARTY. OH, I THOUGHT IT WAS COCKTAIL. YEAH, WITH EVERYTHING GOING ON THIS YEAR, WE FIGURE, "LIGHTEN THE MOOD." LET'S GO SHOPPING AND GET YOU ONE. OKAY. READY WHEN YOU ARE. OH, RIGHT NOW. OKAY, OKAY. I CAN EAT A LITTLE MORE OF THESE. HALLE. COME, COME. I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE YOU TO MY OTHER GRANDDAUGHTER, HALLE. EXCUSE ME. THIS IS CONSIDERED "DRESSED UP" IN CHICAGO. WISH I COULD TRADE YOU. YOU'RE REALLY LIGHTING UP THE PLACE. "HOW DO YOU ACCEPT THAT THE FAMILY" YOU HAVE DREAMED OF FOR A LIFETIME IS A NIGHTMARE? "THIS ENTIRE MOORE FAMILY IS FAKE." HEY. THIS IS FROM DEVIN. SO, WILL YOU TELL ME MORE ABOUT THAT BOOK YOU MENTIONED? I CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT. THANK YOU! I'LL GO READ IT NOW. NO, THANK YOU. YOU ARE SO SWEET. YOU MAKE THIS MUCH EASIER. WELL, I TAKE BEING A BROTHER SERIOUSLY. YOU OWNED THAT SWEATER. I HAD TO. COULDN'T LET MY OPPONENTS SEE ME BREAK DOWN. YEAH. SEEMS LIKE THIS FAMILY BRINGS OUT THAT SIDE OF ME. DEFIANCE? RESILIENCE. ALRIGHT. LET'S GET TO COOKING. HERE WE GO. WE GOT SOME APPLESAUCE. MM. THIS SMELLS AMAZING. GIVE EUGENE ALL THE CREDIT. I BURNED WATER BEFORE HE AND HIS WIFE TAUGHT ME. OH, SORRY. WE SMELLED SOMETHING GOOD. AH-AH! YOU'VE EARNED WHATEVER'S ABOUT TO HAPPEN TO YOU. WANT SOME? YOU'RE LUCKY I'M NOT GOING SOUTH SIDE ON YOU TONIGHT. LOOK, I DIDN'T MEAN TO... TO EMBARRASS ME IN A ROOM FULL OF PEOPLE? OR TO TAINT WHAT I THOUGHT WAS FINALLY A NICE DAY SPENT WITH MY NEW SISTER? D, THIS SMELLS AMAZING, MAN. OH, THIS ISN'T ME. IT'S ALL HALLE. IT'S EUGENE'S RECIPE. HALLE. YOU COULD HAVE TOLD US YOU NEEDED APPROPRIATE ATTIRE. YOU'VE BEEN SO TASTEFUL IN YOUR CLOTHES UNTIL NOW. TALK TO TIFFANY. WHY WOULD I WEAR THAT SWEATER WHEN I HAVE A DESIGNER COCKTAIL DRESS IN THE CLOSET? FINE, BUT I DON'T WANT TO KEEP WORRYING ABOUT THE NEXT UNEXPECTED THING YOU'RE GONNA DO OR SAY. IF YOU WANT ME TO TRUST YOU, STOP COMING FOR ME LIKE THIS. TRUST IS A TWO-WAY STREET. MM! WHO'S GOING TO START? HEY. NO ONE HAS EVER DARED TO DO THAT BEFORE. DONE WHAT? SAY EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE THINKING. AT THIS RATE, I DON'T KNOW THAT I'LL MAKE IT TO CHRISTMAS DAY. YOU WILL. TRUST ME. MEMAW AND DREW, THEY'RE WORTH PUTTING UP WITH THE CRAZY, SO STAY FOR THEM. HMM. STAY FOR ME. WE ARE GOING TO GET THROUGH THIS FIRST CHRISTMAS WITHOUT MY SON AS A FAMILY. AM I CLEAR? YES, MA'AM. HALLE, COME WITH ME. SHE ACTUALLY TOOK YOU SHOPPING TO BUY THAT AWFUL SWEATER? SHE DID. I'VE NEVER SEEN SOMEONE COMMIT THAT HARD TO A PRANK. SHE'S A PUBLICIST FOR A REASON. JOAN'S RIGHT, THOUGH. I AM KEEPING SOMETHING FROM YOU... BUT I'M ALSO KEEPING IT FROM THE WHOLE WORLD. I DON'T WORK FOR A PUBLISHER. THEY KIND OF WORK FOR ME. I WRITE UNDER THE NAME H.D. MADISON. YOU WRITE THE "CHRISTINA" BOOKS. YOU KNOW ABOUT THEM? I SIT ON THE BOARD OF A LIBRARY. OF COURSE I KNOW ABOUT THEM. THE SUPERHERO OF... FOSTER CARE. OH, HALLE. YOU SHARE YOUR PAIN AND YOUR TRIUMPHS. WHY NOT TELL THE WORLD YOU'RE A WRITER? WELL, THERE'S A SHAME TO FEELING UNWANTED. IT'S A SECRET THAT WALKS INTO EVERY ROOM WITH ME. ANONYMITY IS FREEDOM. THANK YOU FOR TRUSTING ME WITH THIS. I WON'T SAY A WORD. OH, HALLE... WOULD YOU STOP A MINUTE? IT'S LATE. I'M HEADING TO BED. I EXPLODED EARLIER. I DIDN'T WANT HOWARD'S BUSINESS ASSOCIATES BEING INTRODUCED TO YOU THAT WAY. NEITHER DID I. WAIT, IS THIS...? HOWARD'S OFFICE? IT IS. OH, HE WAS A HARD WORKER. HE WOULD BE IN HERE ALL HOURS OF THE NIGHT, CREATING. I'M JUST TRYING TO GET SOME INSPIRATION FROM THAT. INSPIRATION. I'M TRYING TO FIND SOME OF THAT MYSELF. OH, ARE YOU WORKING ON A PROJECT? YES. RIGHT. ABOUT THAT. IS YOUR OFFER TO READ MY WORK ON THE TABLE? SURE. THANKS. GOOD NIGHT. GOOD NIGHT. THAT SOUNDS AWFUL. YOU NEED ME TO COME DOWN THERE? I MEAN, I'LL SET THEM STRAIGHT. YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO PUT UP WITH ALL OF THAT THIS SOON. I HAVE TO GET THIS BOOK DONE. MAYBE I SHOULD JUST STAY SOMEWHERE ELSE. NO. YOU'RE BLOCKED BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T DONE THE WORK TO GET THE ANSWERS THAT YOU NEED. KEEP AT IT, AND KEEP YOUR RIGHT HOOK READY. EUGENE, I GOT TO TAKE THIS. GET TO WORK. HI, SABRINA. I'VE BEEN TRYING TO REACH YOU FOREVER. I'M AT MY LIMIT, HALLE. SABRINA, YOU TOLD ME TO GET YOU PAGES BY CHRISTMAS, WHICH IS STILL A FEW DAYS AWAY, RIGHT? WELL, YES. THEN UNLESS YOU'RE CALLING TO OFFER ME SOME WORDS OF ENCOURAGEMENT, I'D RATHER GET BACK TO WORK. SHE'S BACK! THIS IS THE HALLE I LOVE TO FIGHT FOR. YEAH. IS THAT A "DEAR JOAN" LETTER? NO, IT'S NOTHING. ALRIGHT, YOU TWO. IT'S ALMOST CHRISTMAS, NOW MAKE UP. IF NOT FOR ME, DO IT FOR MEMAW. IF NOT FOR ME AND MEMAW, DO IT FOR DREW, SANTA, WHOEVER YOU NEED IT TO BE. YOU FIRST. I'M SORRY, HALLE. THAT WAS A VERY IMMATURE THING THAT I DID TO YOU. FOR MEMAW AND DREW, THERE WILL BE NO PAYBACK TODAY. Y'ALL CAN'T FEEL THE CHRISTMAS SPIRIT? SURE, BUT I NEED TO GO PREPARE FOR THE GREEN CARPET TOMORROW. SHE INVITED HER GIRLFRIEND. IF SHE'S GONNA BE IN TOWN FOR THE EVENT, YOU SHOULD INVITE HER TO SPEND TIME WITH YOUR FAMILY. NOW, SHE'S ONLY IN TOWN TO SUPPORT THE ARTISTS BECAUSE THEY USED TO TOUR TOGETHER. SHE LEAVES ON A RED-EYE AFTER THE CHESS SLAM. IF SHE'S COMING ALL THE WAY OUT HERE, YOU SHOULD INVITE HER. I GOT ON A PLANE NOT KNOWING ANY OF YOU, AND I'VE NEVER BEEN MORE NERVOUS TO MEET ANYONE, BUT IT FELT GOOD TO BE INVITED. INVITING HER WILL MAKE HER FEEL LIKE YOU'RE REALLY LETTING HER IN, IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT. THAT IS WHAT I WANT. THEN LISTEN TO HALLE. AT LEAST INVITE HER TO THE CHESS SLAM. YOU CAN LET HER DECIDE IF IT'S TOO MUCH. SHE MIGHT SURPRISE YOU. IT'S CHRISTMAS. THERE'S NO BETTER TIME TO MAKE THIS REALLY GOOD CHOICE. MM-HMM. IT'S HER. HEY, BABY. I ONLY GOT A SECOND. I'M AT THE STUDIO, AND THE DESIGNER SENT THE DRESSES. WHICH ONE AM I WEARING TOMORROW NIGHT? JUST BRING THEM BOTH, AND WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT WHEN I SEE THEM. GOT IT. I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW. WILL YOU COME WITH ME TO MY LITTLE BROTHER'S CHESS SLAM? PLEASE. CHESS IS HIS LIFE. BABE? WILL YOU COME WITH ME TO MY BROTHER'S CHESS SLAM? IT'S HOURS BEFORE YOUR FLIGHT. MY WHOLE FAMILY WILL BE THERE. WHICH BROTHER? THE LITTLE ONE? OH, IF IT'S HIM, YES. GLENN? NO WAY. YES, MY BABY BROTHER, DREW. WOW. I FINALLY GET TO MEET THE REST OF THE FAMILY? SHOOT ME THE DEETS, I'LL BE THERE. I GOT TO GO, BABE. OKAY. BYE, GLENN. BYE. I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW EASY THAT WAS. YOU WERE RIGHT, HALLE. I HELPED TOO. WOULD YOU MIND DROPPING ME OFF AT THE STORE ON YOUR WAY TO WORK? ONLY IF YOU MEET US SOMEWHERE AFTER. OKAY, LET ME GET MY COAT. YOU MADE A MIRACLE HAPPEN TODAY, OLDEST SISTER. TIFFANY AND PARIS MAKE EACH OTHER HAPPY, AND WE COULD ALL USE SOME MORE OF THAT RIGHT NOW. WELL, MAYBE THIS WAS A GIRL THING. SHE JUST NEEDED SOME SISTERLY ADVICE. GLENN, I THINK HALLE IS RIGHT, AND WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU? "OLD" IS NO BETTER THAN "BIG." I'M GLAD IT WORKED OUT. I'M STARTING TO GAIN SOME PERSPECTIVE ON HOW THINGS RUN IN THIS FAMILY. OH, LIKE WHAT? LIKE REALIZING THERE'S A LEARNING CURVE TO BEING A SISTER. MAYBE IF WE HELP EACH OTHER, THE REST WILL JUST FALL INTO PLACE. DO YOU KNOW WHY WE BROUGHT YOU HERE TWICE NOW? BECAUSE THE FOOD IS GOOD? DADDY BROUGHT US HERE FOR EVERY SPECIAL OCCASION. THIS IS ONE OF HIS FAVORITE PLACES. IT'S ONE OF YOUR TRADITIONS? IT'S A DAD TRADITION. I GUESS YOU DIDN'T TELL ME THAT BEFORE BECAUSE... WE WEREN'T READY. I GET IT. YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE SOME OF HIS MANNERISMS. BIG TIME. Y'ALL SMILE JUST THE SAME. SO JUST KNOW, WE KNOW YOU'RE ONE OF US, EVEN IF WE DON'T ALWAYS SAY IT, BECAUSE IT'S AWKWARD. YEAH. THANK YOU. THAT MEANS A LOT. NOT TO BREAK THE MOOD OR ANYTHING, BUT MAY I ASK YOU SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT A CONCEPT YOU INSPIRED? I DID? WHAT WAS IT? IT'S AN APP THAT CONNECTS PEOPLE TO FAMILIES DURING THE HOLIDAYS OR WHENEVER PEOPLE ARE IN NEED OF SOME EXTENDED FAMILY. THAT'S A GREAT IDEA. FROM COLLEGE KIDS THAT CAN'T GET HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS TO SENIORS WHO DON'T HAVE FAMILIES... THERE'S A MARKET FOR THAT. LOOK AT YOU GUYS BUILDING A BUSINESS IN DADDY'S HOTEL. ALL I KNOW IS, HOWEVER IT GOES, I WANT TO HANDLE ALL THE PRESS DEAL. OKAY. CHEERS. CHEERS. THEY'RE GOING TO LOVE YOU. WELCOME. YOU ALMOST GOT LEFT. WELL, IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU, TOO, GLENN. MEMAW, HALLE, DEVIN, THIS IS PARIS. PARIS, THIS IS MY FAMILY. WELCOME, PARIS. WE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT YOU FROM TIFFANY AND GLENN. OH, THANK YOU. THE PLEASURE IS MINE. AND GLENN, YOU ARE GETTING FOUR BACKSTAGE PASSES TO MY NEW YEAR'S SHOW IN L.A. WE'LL PAUSE OUR TEASING FOR ONE NIGHT. LOVE HAVING SISTERS. IF YOU'RE DONE DANCING, WE CAN GET TO THE SLAM. TIFF TOLD ME WHAT YOU SAID TO HER. I DIDN'T DO MUCH. SHE JUST NEEDED A LITTLE PUSH IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. WELL, THANK YOU FOR THAT PUSH. CHECK IT OUT! I WON! WOW. THIS IS AMAZING. YEAH, IT IS! CAN'T BELIEVE I WON. DID YOU EVER GET A CHANCE TO REVIEW THAT EDIT I LEFT FOR YOU? WHAT ARE YOU EDITING, SISTER DEAR? GREAT. SORRY. HALLE IS REVIEWING SOMETHING I'M WRITING. YOU'RE A WRITER, MAMA? SHE IS, AND IT'S EXCELLENT. WOW. THAT'S AWESOME, JOAN. IT'S ONLY MY FIRST CHAPTER. SOMETIMES THAT'S ALL IT TAKES. AND YOU KNOW THIS FROM YOUR WEALTH OF EXPERIENCE PROOFING? JOAN, YOU'RE RIGHT. I AM KEEPING SOMETHING FROM YOU. I WRITE BOOKS. PUBLISHED BOOKS. I'M H.D. MADISON. THE H.D. MADISON? SOLD LIKE A JILLION COPIES THAT ARE PROBABLY GONNA BE MOVIES? WHY NOT JUST TELL US YOU'RE A FAMOUS AUTHOR? I WANTED YOU TO GET TO KNOW HALLE DOWNING FIRST. AND JOAN, YOUR WORK INSPIRED ME. I'VE EVEN BEEN TRYING TO WRITE MY NEXT BOOK, AND I NEED TO BE MORE CONFIDENT. SO YOU'RE WRITING ABOUT US? NOT ABOUT YOU, BUT INSPIRED BY. I'M SO PROUD OF YOU, HALLE. HERE, CAN I HAVE YOUR AUTOGRAPH? SURE. YES. SURE. WHAT DO YOU WANT IT TO SAY? WHERE ARE YOU GOING? I WAS RIGHT ABOUT HER. SHE'S BEEN LYING TO US ALL ALONG, AND NOW SHE'S SECRETLY A FAMOUS AUTHOR WORTHY OF OUR PRAISE? TONIGHT IS ABOUT DREW. LET'S HAVE OUR CELEBRATION AS WE PLANNED. IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY, AND I'M TIRED. DREW, BABY, COME TELL ME GOOD NIGHT BEFORE YOU GO TO BED. WELL, IMAGINE IF YOU MADE A BOOK ABOUT ME. HE DIDN'T EVEN HEAR ME. YOU ALL ARE MAKING IT SO EASY FOR HER TO BECOME A MOORE IN A WAY YOU DIDN'T FOR ME. I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE SAYING THIS. THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE TODAY. BEFORE EACH SEAT, THERE IS A SEALED ENVELOPE THAT CONTAINS THE SPECIFIC DETAILS OF YOUR DISTRIBUTION. BUT BEFORE WE GO OVER THAT, WE HAVE A VIDEO TO PLAY, SO MR. MOORE CAN EXPLAIN SOME THINGS HIMSELF. HELLO, FAMILY. DON'T WORRY, YOU'LL BE SMILING BY THE END OF THIS. I DON'T WANT ANY CONFUSION WHEN IT COMES TO MY AFFAIRS, SO MY ATTORNEY HAS BEEN INSTRUCTED TO FOLLOW MY WISHES TO THE LETTER... AND FOR THAT, CANDACE, I THANK YOU. TO DREW, TIFFANY, AND GLENN... LOVE YOU ALL. GO BE SUCCESSFUL, TAKE CARE OF EACH OTHER, AND KEEP DOING ALL OUR FUN STUFF. AND BOYS, YES, TIFFANY IS THE BOSS OF YOU GUYS. BUT THEN AGAIN, THERE IS STRENGTH IN NUMBERS, RIGHT? DADDY... YOU HEARD THE MAN. DEVIN, MY MAN. YOU MADE ME PROUD. GET THAT RESTAURANT STARTED. YOU DON'T HAVE TO NAME IT "HOWARD'S" UNLESS YOU WANT TO... BUT, YOU KNOW, NO PRESSURE. MAMA, YOU GAVE ME EVERYTHING. ALL MY SUCCESS IS YOURS, TOO. I KNOW YOU THINK I SPOILED EVERYONE, BUT WHERE DO YOU THINK I LEARNED IT? JOAN, MY BELOVED WIFE. I KNOW I AM AMAZING IN EVERY WAY POSSIBLE... HANDSOME, THOUGHTFUL, AND I GAVE THE BEST ANNIVERSARY GIFTS, AND EVEN WHEN I FORGOT, YOU TOOK IT OUT ON MY CREDIT CARDS. I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW, BEING YOUR HUSBAND MADE ME A VERY LUCKY MAN. I LOVE YOU, SWEETHEART. AND TO HALLE, IF YOU'RE THERE... NOT A DAY PASSED THAT I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT YOU. I PRAY THAT THE FAMILY CAN DO FOR YOU NOW WHAT I COULDN'T, AND KNOW THIS... I'M A FAN. SO CHEER UP, FAMILY, I LOVE YOU ALL, AND I KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE WHAT'S IN THOSE ENVELOPES. YEAH. WE HAVE COPIES OF THAT FOR EACH OF YOU. PLEASE, OPEN YOUR ENVELOPES. YOU WILL FIND SPECIFIC DETAILS THAT PERTAIN TO YOU PERSONALLY, BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT, YOU EACH GET A SEAT ON THE BOARD WITH INVESTMENTS AVAILABLE FOR YOU TO EACH LAUNCH A PROJECT WITH COMPANY BACKING. YESSS. WE ALL GET THE SAME THING. WITH ONE EXCEPTION... MRS. MOORE RECEIVES HOWARD'S CONTROLLING COMPANY INTEREST. OH, I'M SORRY. I MEANT MRS. FIONA MOORE. IT AN ORIGINAL CLAUSE... EXCUSE ME. FROM WHEN THE COMPANY WAS FOUNDED. I UNDERSTAND. IT'S OKAY. IT'S ALRIGHT. IT'S OKAY. GLENN. SHOW THEM WHAT YOU GOT. BEFORE WE GO INSIDE, I'D LIKE TO SHOW YOU ALL WHAT I DID. OH, WOW. OHHHH. GLENN DESIGNED IT WITH HOWARD. IT'S BEAUTIFUL. LET ME SHOW YOU WHAT I DID. HOW DID HE DO THAT ON HIS PHONE? BABY, IT'S BEAUTIFUL. LOOK, WE STARTED WORKING ON THIS LAST YEAR. OH, MY GOD. WONDERFUL. ARE YOU FEELING BETTER? YES, BABY. PRETTY CHRISTMAS LIGHTS MAKE EVERYONE FEEL BETTER. I NEED TO CALL PARIS BACK, BUT IT'S TWO HOURS EARLIER IN L.A., AND I AM HUNGRY HERE, RIGHT NOW. HOW ABOUT PIZZA AND DESSERT? ON A NIGHT LIKE THIS, I REQUIRE BOTH. I CAN'T REMEMBER THE LAST TIME I ATE PIZZA. THAT'S A GREAT IDEA. THE PLACE UP THE STREET DELIVERS. OKAY. PLACE THE ORDER. IS THERE SOMETHING SWEET WE CAN HAVE WHEN WE WAIT? I THINK I GOT SOMETHING FOR YOU. THERE'S ICE CREAM. WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE? PIZZAS WILL BE HERE IN 30 MINUTES. WE'RE HAVING A PIZZA AND ICE CREAM PARTY, COURTESY OF HALLE. YEAH! BEST IDEA EVER. WELL, YOU COULD HOST THE PIZZA AND ICE CREAM PARTY AGAIN NEXT YEAR. THAT'S A TRADITION I WOULD LOVE PUTTING IN ROTATION. WELL, I HAVE TO TEACH YOU ALL WHAT REAL PIZZA IS. I'D LOVE TO... MEMAW. GOOD NIGHT. WHAT DID I ALMOST JUST CATCH YOU DOING? I HAVE NO IDEA. JUST STANDING HERE. UH-HUH. AH-AH-AH-AH! GLENN! NO GIFTS ON CHRISTMAS EVE. MEMAW, YOU KNOW I WASN'T... GLENN, YOU KNOW BETTER THAN THAT. I WASN'T DOING NOTHING. I'M READY. WHERE ARE JOAN AND DREW? LET ME GO SEE WHAT'S KEEPING THEM. JOAN, YOU ALRIGHT? I'M FINE, THANK YOU. COME WITH US. FETE QUARTIER IS OUR CHRISTMAS EVE TRADITION. I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE YOU HERE ALONE. YOU NEED TO BE WITH YOUR FAMILY. MY FAMILY. MEMAW, I JUST NEED A DAY OFF. IF DREW IS WITH ALL OF YOU, HE WON'T EVEN MISS ME. HE'S IN HIS ROOM. SWEETHEART, I KNOW YOU'RE IN PAIN AND YOU'RE GRIEVING. WE'RE GOING TO SET THINGS STRAIGHT. I PROMISE YOU. GIRL KNOWS HER STUFF. HEY, HOW WAS THE PARTY? IT WAS SO MUCH FUN! WE PLAYED GAMES, MY FRIENDS FROM SCHOOL CAME AND WE ATE A LOT OF PIZZA. SOUNDS LIKE SOMEONE ATE EVERYTHING SWEET HE COULD FIND. GO AHEAD, GET READY FOR BED, OKAY? BRUSH YOUR TEETH. PSHH. PSHH. EVERYONE ASKED ABOUT YOU. I JUST NEEDED SOME TIME TO MYSELF... AND IT'S A GOOD THING, TOO, BECAUSE I FOUND SOMETHING THAT YOU ALL NEED TO KNOW ABOUT. MERRY ALMOST-CHRISTMAS, HALLE. YEAH, YOU HAVE A GOOD NIGHT. YOU TOO. BYE. "WHO WOULD WANT TO BE IN A FAMILY LIKE THIS?" I HAVE NEVER BEEN HAPPIER TO HAVE GROWN UP WITHOUT THEM. "I CAN'T IMAGINE WHO I WOULD HAVE BECOME." YOU SEE? YOU BROUGHT THIS STRANGER IN HERE, AND SHE JUST WANTS TO WRITE TRASH ABOUT US. JOAN, PLEASE. SHE'S HERE. LET HER SPEAK FOR HERSELF. IS THIS TRUE? DID YOU WRITE THAT? LET ME EXPLAIN. I KNEW YOU'D SHOW YOUR TRUE COLORS EVENTUALLY. I TOLD YOU I'M PROTECTIVE OF THIS FAMILY, AND WE WILL NOT BE TRASHED IN PRINT. SO SHE SNEAKS INTO MY ROOM, FINDS MY PRIVATE THOUGHTS, AND SOMEHOW I'M THE VILLAIN? I DIDN'T SNEAK ANYWHERE. THIS WAS STUCK TO MY PAGES. SO YOU DID WRITE THOSE WORDS? MM. TIFF. TIFF, BE COOL. I TOLD YOU. I TOLD YOU. I WAS ANGRY. THAT'S ALL. THAT'S ALL YOU HAVE TO SAY? WHAT ELSE CAN I SAY? I NEVER MEANT FOR YOU ALL TO HEAR THAT. I DIDN'T WANT TO LIKE YOU. I LET YOU IN. YOU GOT TO BE ONE OF US, AND YOU'RE WRITING TRASH ABOUT US? ABOUT MY DADDY. YOU SHOULD LEAVE. NO ONE WILL STOP YOU. HI, YOU'VE REACHED DEVIN'S VOICEMAIL. PLEASE BE SURE TO LEAVE YOUR NAME AND YOUR NUMBER, AND I'LL BE SURE TO RETURN YOUR CALL. WE WAITED FOR YOU. I TAKE BEING A BROTHER VERY SERIOUSLY. I DON'T WANT TO KEEP WORRYING ABOUT THE NEXT UNEXPECTED THING YOU ARE GONNA DO OR SAY. IT'S A DAD TRADITION. I DIDN'T WANT TO LIKE YOU. I LET YOU IN. THANKS TO YOU, IT'S GONNA BE A VERY MERRY CHRISTMAS. WELL, I GOT IT STARTED, AND YOU KEPT IT GOING. WE CAN SHARE THE CREDIT. WHAT ABOUT CHRISTINA? DID YOU GET IN WHAT YOU NEEDED TO? I'M NOT BLOCKED ANYMORE. MY FAMILY MADE SURE I GOT ALL THE ANSWERS I NEED FOR THIS BOOK. I'M PROUD OF YOU, BABY GIRL. MERRY CHRISTMAS. MERRY CHRISTMAS. HALLE GOT ALL OF US GIFTS. MEMAW. TIFF. OHH. OOH. AWW. AW. LOOK. HOW COOL. SHE GAVE US GIFTS, AND BROUGHT SOME OF HER HOMETOWN TO SHARE WITH US. HMM. I'M NOT OPENING MINE. HEY, HEY! MERRY CHRISTMAS, EVERYONE. IS HALLE WITH YOU? NO, ISN'T SHE HERE? SHE LEFT. HER PHONE GOES STRAIGHT TO VOICEMAIL. OKAY, WELL, I'LL CALL. DEVIN, YOUR PHONE IS IN THE KITCHEN. HOWARD WOULD BE SO DISAPPOINTED IN US. HALLE GOT TIFFANY TO FINALLY INTRODUCE US TO PARIS, GLENN WORKING ON HIS APP. EVEN I SEE THAT I DID NOTHING TO HELP HER, AGAIN. FAMILY IS SUPPOSED TO GET IN THE WAY FOR EACH OTHER. SO SHE JUST GETS TO COME IN HERE AND WRITE ALL THOSE AWFUL THINGS? OH, I'D WRITE HATEFUL THINGS ABOUT ALL OF YOU IF I HAD A DIARY RIGHT NOW. I JUST READ WHAT SHE WROTE. SHE THREW HER OUT OF THE HOUSE. BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT EVERYONE WANTED ME TO DO. YOU SAID SHE WAS GONNA PUBLISH WHAT SHE WROTE ABOUT US. AND YOU HUMILIATED HER IN FRONT OF A ROOM FULL OF PEOPLE. AND JOAN, YOU THOUGHT HER COMING HERE WAS GOING TO COST YOU SOMETHING. WELL, THE ONE YOU'RE MAD AT IS GONE. HEY, UM... HALLE CALLED ME LATE LAST NIGHT. SHE'S NOT PICKING UP FOR ME EITHER. WE KNOW WHERE SHE IS. WE KNOW WHERE SHE IS. HALLE. HOW DID YOU... I'M SORRY I DIDN'T ANSWER YOUR CALLS, OKAY? I LEFT MY PHONE AT THE HOUSE AGAIN LAST NIGHT. IT ALL WENT VERY LEFT LAST NIGHT, SO I THINK I'M JUST GONNA GO HOME. MAYBE IF I GET BACK TO CHICAGO EARLY ENOUGH, I CAN GO TO EUGENE'S DINNER. YEAH, BUT IT'S CHRISTMAS. I KNOW, BUT I MESSED EVERYTHING UP. NO, YOU... NOT WITH ME. LOOK, HALLE, I DON'T BLAME YOU FOR WANTING TO LEAVE. I DON'T, BUT... WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT YOU TO GO. "WE?" WAIT, HOW DID YOU EVEN KNOW I WAS HERE? TIFFANY AND GLENN TOLD ME. I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU WERE GONE UNTIL AFTER I LEFT THE HOUSE THIS MORNING. I THOUGHT YOU'D SPENT CHRISTMAS MORNING WITH YOUR FAMILY. I WANTED TO SPEND THIS ONE WITH YOU. MERRY CHRISTMAS. CHOICES AND TIMING. WHAT WAS THAT? NOTHING. MERRY CHRISTMAS. COME ON OUT, GUYS. THEY WANTED TO SURPRISE YOU. OH, MY GOD. WE'RE SORRY, HALLE. LET'S GO HOME. YES. LET'S GO HOME. ON THE WAY BACK TO THE HOTEL, TIFFANY AND I TALKED. I WASN'T EVEN AWARE THAT I WENT FROM CALLING THE TWINS MY KIDS BEFORE DREW, TO MY STEPKIDS AFTER. ME BEING... THAT CARELESS JUST CAUSED THEM TO PULL AWAY FROM ME. IT NEVER OCCURRED TO ME THAT... THE DISTANCE BETWEEN US WAS MY OWN FAULT. HOW DO I FIX THAT? TIFFANY WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN THAT CANDID WITH YOU IF SHE WASN'T READY TO FIX IT. AND I WANT YOU TO HELP ME FIGURE OUT A ROLE IN THE COMPANY THAT WILL LET YOU BE THERE FOR DREW, WRITE YOUR BOOK AND WHATEVER ELSE YOU WANT. IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU RETURN ON YOUR OWN TERMS. SWEETHEART, YOU DESERVE IT. THANK YOU, MEMAW. MERRY CHRISTMAS. OHH. I WANTED TO START BY SAYING I'M SORRY FOR WHAT I WROTE. IT WAS IN A MOMENT OF ANGER, AFTER I'D BEEN... OH, HALLE. WE KNOW. I HAD WRITER'S BLOCK, BUT THIS FAMILY INSPIRED ME TO WRITE WHAT MY BOOK IS REALLY GONNA BE ABOUT. I'M NOT JUST A PAWN WHO GETS MOVED FROM HOME TO HOME ANYMORE. SO, WHAT FINALLY GOT YOU GOING? ALL OF YOU HAVE TOUCHED MY HEART IN DIFFERENT WAYS. I FEEL SO CONNECTED TO ALL OF YOU IN A WAY I'VE NEVER FELT BEFORE. I'M NEW TO THE WHOLE FAMILY THING, BUT... WHEN YOU HAVE ONE, YOU HOLD ON. RIGHT, MEMAW? OH, THAT'S RIGHT, BABY. SO THAT'S WHAT THE BOOK IS ABOUT... HOW I FOUND MYSELF BY FINDING YOU. SOUNDS LIKE A BESTSELLER, IF YOU ASK ME. WELL, BREAKFAST IS NOW BRUNCH. LET'S EAT. DEVIN, WOULD YOU MIND HELPING ME IN THE KITCHEN? YES, MA'AM. AND I'LL GET DREW. UM, HALLE, CAN I HAVE A MOMENT? SURE. THE GIFTS THAT YOU GAVE US, THEY WERE SO PERSONAL. I FIGURED YOU'D NEED BUSINESS CARDS FOR YOUR BOOK SIGNINGS AND WHATEVER. WELL... I WANTED YOU TO HAVE THIS. IT BELONGED TO YOUR FATHER. AND SINCE H.D. MADISON AND HOWARD MOORE HAVE THE SAME INITIALS, I FIGURED THAT BELONGED TO YOU. YOU GOT A FIRST EDITION OF MY BOOK? WELL, I WAS WRITING YOU A NOTE THIS MORNING AND I FOUND IT... IN HOWARD'S DESK. THANK YOU, JOAN. I MEAN THAT. NOW LET'S GO EAT. COME ON. OKAY, EVERYBODY. CHRISTMAS BRUNCH IS SERVED. MEMAW, ARE Y'ALL TRYING TO GET ME FAT? I CAN'T WAIT FOR YOU TO MEET EUGENE. YOU'RE GONNA LOVE HIM. I'M GLAD YOU CAME BACK. ME TOO. MERRY CHRISTMAS, DREW. YOU'RE THE BEST CHRISTMAS PRESENT THERE IS. MERRY CHRISTMAS. DID YOU GET ALL 12 GIFTS? 'CAUSE I TOOK ALL THE HOTEL SOAPS IN MY ROOM, IF YOU NEED THEM, OKAY. ALRIGHT. TIFF. I'M SORRY. MERRY CHRISTMAS. TEST YOUR LUCK. HALLE? HM? PARIS IS BACK IN L.A. I SENT HER A PIC OF ME IN THIS SWEATER, AND SHE USED IT IN HER POST MAKING US OFFICIAL. AWW, CUTE. I'M GLAD WE'RE EVEN. THE SWEATER? NO, TIFF. THAT'S NOT MY PAYBACK. WHOSE CAR DO YOU THINK I TOOK LAST NIGHT? OHH. OHHH. AND I DROVE DOWN ALL THE MUDDIEST ROADS I COULD FIND. WE CAN GET IT FROM THE VALET LATER, IF YOU WANT. CHECKMATE. WELL, WE SUFFERED A MAJOR LOSS THIS YEAR, AND WE RECEIVED A BIG WIN. WELCOME TO OUR FAMILY. TO HALLE. MERRY CHRISTMAS. MERRY CHRISTMAS, FAMILY. AWW. OKAY, LET'S EAT. NO, NO, WAIT, WAIT. WAIT, NOW. THANK YOU FOR THE FOOD WE'RE ABOUT TO RECEIVE, AND THANK YOU FOR GIVING HOWARD THE WISDOM PULLING US ALL TOGETHER AT CHRISTMAS. AMEN. AMEN. ALRIGHT. FIRST THINGS FIRST.
