"Keep on singing and humming, my friend." "Keep on singing and humming, my friend." "O friend." "Let every moment pass happily." "Keep on singing and humming, my friend." "O friend. - Keep on singing and humming, my friend." "The open sky, these green and luscious fields." "No matter how many times you see them you never get your fill." "Every creation is so wonderful." "The flowers give the message to laugh even in hardship." "Friend.. to laugh even in hardship." "O traveler.." "..don't lose your delicate heart." "Keep on singing and humming, my friend." "O friend." "The water in the river shines like silver." "Each drop of water gives us life." "It drops from the sky and unites with the land." "Without water, nothing is possible." "..nothing is possible. - O brother, nothing is possible." "O clouds.." "..had there been no water, this world would have burned." "Keep on singing and humming, my friend." "Keep on singing and humming, my friend." "Keep on singing and humming, my friend." "Keep on singing and humming, my friend." Watch out! Watch out! Watch out! After passing through cities and villages.. ..and creating a sensation the evergreen theatre is.. ..now in your village. Banke! Boss, you've increased the ticket rates. So you'll have to increase our pay too. - You pigeon.. ..I turned you from a slob into Banke Lal the actor! But you're showing attitude to me today! - What can I do? Mom has written to me from our village. For 1 rupee, instead of a kilo of rice you get only 800 grams now. And you now get only 250 grams of ghee.. ..and only half the amount of sugar for a rupee. Is this inflation or a calamity? So you tell me what will mom eat and wear there with only 10 rupees? And how will I bear my expenses here? Am I responsible for the inflation? There's a war going on, so why won't there be inflation? Go and ask them. Why should I? You go and ask! I want a raise of 5 rupees, that's all. Banke, did your mother and the inflation.. ..tell you to show your attitude at this time? My dear, if you reject my pleas like them.. ..there won't be any difference between a lover and a killer. Little boy, you even talk as if you're some great singer! O dear, had you been younger I'd have married you. What are you saying, Champa Bai? You're so kindhearted. So, please have some mercy on me too. The second bell has also started ringing! I'm ruined! And they're flirting with each other like lovers! When the curtains are raised on the third bell.. ..people will burn everything down and destroy everything! Neither this tent will remain nor will these musical instruments! Boss, don't try to act smart in front of the actors! Increase my salary. Else, you'll have to pay the price! Understand? My dear.. - That's enough. This love story is over. Boss. - Yes? Increase his salary. - What? By 3 rupees. Come on. - 3 rupees? No! 1 rupee. Boss, 3 rupees! No. No. "My husband is so young!" "How will I enjoy my youth now?" "What a big problem I am in!" "How will I enjoy my youth now?" "My husband is so young!" "How will I enjoy my youth now?" "By the time he matures up.." "..I won't remain young anymore." "By the time he matures up.." "..I won't remain young anymore." "By the time his flame ignites.." "..I'd have turned to ashes." "These are the days for fun." "How will I enjoy my youth now?" "My husband is so young!" "How will I enjoy my youth now?" "A flower is always bigger than a bee." "Even then, the bee drinks all its nectar." "A flower is always bigger than a bee." "Even then, the bee drinks all its nectar." "A tailor stitches so many clothes with just a small needle." "Just love me and see." "You'll certainly enjoy your youth." "Just love me and see." "You'll certainly enjoy your youth." "My beloved doesn't have a moustache or a beard." "Even then, he brags a lot." "My beloved doesn't have a moustache or a beard." "Even then, he brags a lot." "His milk teeth aren't gone as yet." "So how can he understand what I am saying?" "This young age is very dangerous." "How will I enjoy my youth now?" "My husband is so young!" "How will I enjoy my youth now?" "Youth, which you're so arrogant about" "Is just like flowing water." "No matter how hard you try to catch it." "It runs away, even if you try for a hundred years." "I pity those who cry at their condition." "I pity those who cry at their condition." "Try to live for others and then see.." "..that's where real happiness lies." "Control your mind and body.." "..then see how you enjoy your youth." "Forget all this fighting." "You'll then enjoy your youth." "Love your beloved." "You'll then enjoy your youth." "My husband is so young!" "How will I enjoy my youth now?" Wow, what a melodious voice you have! You sing so nicely! Today, you saved my company's reputation. Why are you standing there? Go away! You almost spoilt the company's name today, you fool! The company's owner was standing at the corner.. ..and showing me 1 rupee. That's why I forgot. Don't give excuses! Go! Listen, what's your name? Mine? Shyam. What a nice name! Come with me. 3 rupees. Will you drink? What happened? No, this sherbet smells. Its smell refreshes your heart and mind.. ..and brings out a sweet aroma from inside you. Looks like you don't drink. This isn't sherbet, but liquor, you simpleton. Liquor? What's liquor? It's something that intoxicates you. After drinking it, one's forgets all his sorrows.. ..and even himself. But why would one wish to forget himself? To see dreams. - Dreams? I feel that reality and dreams are the same. - How is that? Whatever I see when awake are the same things I see when asleep. The birds flying in the sky, the waves, clouds, fields, trees.. Everything seems so good. - What are you saying? I can't understand anything. In whose drama company did you work before? Gopal Shankar's or Kripa Ram's? Gopal.. I've never even heard their names. And what's drama? You just worked in a drama, but don't even know it! If you don't know, then how did you show that talent? You sang so well. The people were full of praise. Where did you learn it? Tell me the truth. Singing? Nowhere. I sing whatever I feel like. If something I hear feels nice I remember it. Amazing! Where do you live? - Nowhere. What? - I just roam around here and there. New villages, new people, I like everyone. Don't your parents tell you anything? I don't have anyone. Are you all alone? So what? I consider everyone my own, sister. Sister! Did you call me 'sister'? Yes. That's how one addresses his elder sister. You don't like the smell of liquor, right? But what can I do? My sorrow has turned me helpless. It's something very bad. - Then why don't you leave it? Leave it? How can I? The one I loved.. ..handed it to me.. ..and left me forever. The traitor and cheat! Sister! He promised to marry me, then ruined me. And.. Anyway, you're very young.. ..and won't understand all this. Go to sleep. I'll talk to you in the morning. Go to sleep. Boss. Boss. Stop your nonsense! Get out! I'll complain to Champa madam in the morning! This is sheer injustice! Yes, but you too were doing injustice on us. If Shyam hadn't come at the right time our company would have flopped. Shyam will be appointed in your place. Go away! Don't say that, boss! I've served you a lot. And you said that you turned me into an actor from nobody. So why are you ruining this poor man now? How will I earn my living now? What will happen to my mother? Boss, don't fire me. I beg you. Please, don't throw me out. - I don't want to hear anything! Why are you ruining my intoxication? Get lost from here! What? You can't find Shyam anywhere? Where did he go and why? - What can I say, Champa madam? Shyam looks very kindhearted and noble. And he heard that boss was going to fire me. So, he felt pity for me and left. I too will leave now! Get this clear, I too will leave now! You can play the drums in your play then! No, son. I scolded you because I was drunk. Can I ever fire you? You're the hero of this company and also the owner. Come, let me treat you to some great liquor. Leaving me, where have you gone, Shyam? I'm so unfortunate! "Where have I come from and where am I going?" "One who doesn't know that is the happiest." "These moving winds are making a sound." "And these flying birds are living their lives to the fullest." "..their lives to the fullest." "O birds.." "..take wings like birds and fly away." "Keep on singing and humming, my friend." "O friend." "Keep on singing and humming, my friend." "Keep moving." "Keep on singing and humming, my friend." "Keep moving." "Keep on singing and humming, my friend." Why are you laughing? I couldn't control myself after seeing your face. - My face? You put on that thing.. - Keep quiet! Come on, Jai Ram! - Yes, let's go. Strange! Come on! 8 rounds for one paisa! Come, brothers and ride my horses! 8 rounds for one paisa! Come and ride my horses! Ride what? - The horses, of course! White, red, yellow and green horses! - Hello! Take this money. I'll sit on the white horse. Yes dear, the white horse is very strong. So and sit on it. How can she? A child is already sitting on it. Then tell him to alight. - How's that possible? He's already sitting on it. - So what if he's sitting? He can sit later, I'll sit first. - She'll sit on it first. Why are you laughing now? I'm now laughing because you're more immature than that child! How does it matter to you? Who are you to speak in between? Yes, who are you to speak in between? Don't you know? She's the daughter of the landlord of Phoolpur! Is she? - Yes. Greetings, child. I'm so happy to meet you. Why didn't you tell me before? Sit on the red horse. No, I'll sit only on the white horse even if it costs me a fortune! Child, come and sit on the red horse. - No! Don't take me off this horse! - Come on! Brother, come fast! - I'll call him! Brother, come fast and get him off the horse! Who's this 'brother'? - He! C'mon. - Come on, brother! Are you enjoying making this small child cry? Don't cry. Who have you come here with? - With my elder brother. Your elder brother? Where's he? He's gone to buy sweets. That's very good! Let's do one thing. Let's eat the sweets first, then sit on the horse. We'll bring a sweet for your horse too. Then see how he runs. He'll take 10 rounds instead of 8. Okay? Come on, leave this. Happy? Go and sit on the white horse. Will I go and sit on it at your bidding? What's this? I can buy a real horse like this! Right, Jai Ram? - Yes! Let's go, Jai Ram. - Yes, come on. Go and sit on your horse. - On what? On your horse! Stand straight. Run! Run! He saved you, aunt. - The boy really showed courage. What weird people! They left the bull loose! Supposed it had injured him with its horns? Are you hurt, son? - No. Bless you. I'll never forget your favor. Listen. - Yes? What's your name? - Shyam. Have you come to see the carnival? - Yes. Where do you live? - Nowhere. I just travel and stay wherever I arrive. What about your parents and siblings? - I'm all alone. But madam, why does everyone ask me about.. ..where I live and who all are there in my family? All are my own the birds, the animals, mountains, fields.. ..and I belong to them all. - You have such nice thoughts. Come with me. - Where? To that guest house. We're staying there. Come. Well done, son. You saved her. So what? If I wasn't there somebody else would have saved madam. What a great thing you said! Come, son. There's still time for lunch. So have some snacks till then. Come. - Go. Here, eat. You're very hungry, right? - Not at all. Mom, today, at the carnival.. You? He's Shyam, dear. He's a very nice boy. She's our daughter, Radha. Why do you have to tell everyone my name? I'm hungry, give me something to eat. - Okay. Here, eat. Eat. - Where's my sweet? But you don't eat sweets. - I'll eat it today. I had brought only a few. They're over now. You can have it at home. - No, I'll have it right here! Have this. Have this.. Showing pity? I won't eat it! Our love has spoiled her and she gets angry very soon. Eat. - Yes. Jai Ram. - Yes, dear? Remember that boy? - Who? The one at the mask shop and the merry-go-round? Yes. - He's sitting inside.. ..and mom is serving him sweets so fondly! Serving him sweets? I'll have to teach him a lesson now! Shall I drop a scorpion in his clothes? Lizard? Shall I drop a frog? - No! Idea! Wow, did the sun rise from the west today that you're helping me? Aunt says I'm grown up now and should learn all the household chores. Very good, my child! Come, they've already sat down to eat. I'll bring the remaining plates. - Be careful. Ok. The food should be such that one salivates as soon as he sees it. Give it to me. This is dad's, this is mine and this one is for your guest. Okay, sit down. Hail! Start. Why are you looking there? Eat. This bun is so hard! I can't even eat it! Please, bring me a soft one. - Okay. Black gram lentil is the best of all. Taste it and see, son. Why are you eating it with the vegetables? Eat it with the lentil. Oh God! - What happened? Mom, I'll die! Chili! What happened? - This lentil! Was there a stone in the lentil? - No, mom! Chili! I'm burning! But there's no chili in this. Had you eaten this lentil you'd have known! Mom, I'm burning! It got swapped! Swapped? Okay. I must have put chilies in your lentil instead of cumin seeds. You don't know anything, mom! Okay, drink this water. Mom, I'm burning! I thought I'd let him go after lunch. But where will he go? Who? Shyam? Yes..He doesn't have a house.. ..or any relatives. He seems to be very talented and shouldn't be spoilt in bad company. That's why I was thinking why don't we take him along with us? What's the harm in it? He can get some education and find some source of living. He might not have anyone, but he's there himself. We should know his wishes too. I'll ask him. I don't think he'll refuse. Madam. Come son. We were just talking about you. Really? - Yes. What's this? - Please, permit me to go now. But where? - Anywhere. I stayed with you the whole day and had such nice food. And you people are so nice. - Good people find everyone else good too. My respects. Listen. - Yes? You like going to new places and meeting new people. Yes, a lot. - Then why don't you come with us? With you? - Yes. We have luscious and green fields.. ..gardens, cows, and everything else. And we even have a small temple.. ..from where you can see the flowing rivers, the open sky and even the high mountains. Will you come? "The earth is my mother and the sky my father." "The earth is my mother and the sky my father." "I feel that the whole world is my own." "The earth is my mother and the sky my father." "The high mountains covered with clouds." "The flowing river breaking all its bonds." "My heart lies in the smile of the flowers." "I feel that the whole world is my own." "The earth is my mother and the sky my father." "My eyes have beheld many hues." "But I never tied my heart to anyone." "I swim in the waters like the swans." "I feel that the whole world is my own." "The earth is my mother and the sky my father." "I feel that the whole world is my own." Greetings sir. Greetings. - Greetings, madam. Greetings, sir, Greetings. - Greetings, madam. How are you? - Listen. Give sister these offerings first. She'll be very happy. Sister! Glory to God! Are you all back? Bless you. I wasn't so lucky and was home with this ailment. That's why we've brought extra offerings for you. Keep quiet! - Why are you silencing her? She said it and I heard it. Are offerings something to satiate one's hunger with? Just a little is enough. Durga, did you hear what your lovable daughter said? She has become still naughtier after returning from the pilgrimage! Isn't she your lovable too? - Leave it! What can we do, sister? It's her nature. That's why I pray to God to give her some sense! Do you understand? But neither do I have any ailment nor have I become old. So, I don't need any sense. Do you understand? - Stop it! Go away! Ganga, do you see? As soon as she returned home she's started taunting me! That is why I'm telling you to get her married and see her off. Do you understand? Shyam.. Where's Shyam? Jai Ram, where's Shyam? Why are you looking here? Go out and see. Shall I break some more? - No, this is enough. You've taken all of them! Give me one to eat. Here. It's very sour. What's your name? - Meera. Very nice name. Where do you live? There. What will you do with all these mangoes? - I'll make pickle. Pickle? Yes, my mother makes really nice pickle. I just love pickles. Then come with me. - Ok. Where could he have gone? I'm getting so worried! Why are you getting worried? It's rightly said that people invite trouble upon themselves. If you're so worried tell Jai Ram to go and search for him. Mom, here comes your new guest. Come, son. Ask him where he'd been! - I was strolling around in the settlement. It was very nice. - Really! You should have informed us before going! Right, aunt? - Let it be. Okay. Don't scold him. But we were getting very worried for you. She's Radha's aunt. That's enough. Don't come too close. Bless you. Come on, Shyam. You must be tired. Come and have a bath. O God, she was praising him so much! That he's very simple and good looking! Who knows where she found him and brought him here from! We don't even know about his caste or parents! But she's attending to him! 'Come and take a bath'! I've to take a bath before my prayers. Don't you understand? Jai Ram! Jai Ram! - Yes, dear? Shyam, mom's new guest is going to the bathroom for a bath. Dear, I've kept water for him there. There's that itching grass at the backyard.. Should I put some in the water? - Yes. That'll be real fun! Shyam will dance like a monkey! But if anyone finds out, I'll take your name. Don't mention my name. - Don't worry, nobody will find out. I'll be right back. - Go. Boy, why are you going in there? To have a bath. I'll have a bath first! You go and take your bath at the well. I'm getting late for my prayers. Understand? I understand, aunt. - He understood! But where's the well? - On my head! The well is outside! He wants to bathe in the bathroom! Fool! Shyam, you? Here? Yes. I had gone inside to bathe. But aunt said she was getting late. So I came here. What? Aunt? I'll die! O God! What happened? My whole body is itching! - Itching? What happened, sister? Sister. - What? What happened? - Itching? Sister has developed itching! Call the doctor! Is anybody there? It's itching. - Call somebody. You'll be fine, sister. What are you waiting for? Go and bring the cow dung! Go. - The cow dung is ready. Sister, apply this cow dung. Everything will be okay. - Cow dung? No. Its cow dung. You'll be fine. Glory to Lord Krishna. Sister. Sister. - What's it? Nandu says the priest has fever.. ..and won't be ale to read the Ramayana today. It had to happen today! As it is, I was troubled by this itching. And I won't even get to listen to the Ramayana now! Shall I read it out to you? Even I can read it. But when the priest reads it you feel a sort of peace.. ..which you won't get when you or I read it. Hail, Sita and Ram. As you wish. Something's really wrong today! - Listen. What to listen now? "You are holy and erase all sorrows." "O son of Dashrath, you are immortal." "Hail, Lord Ram!" "Whatever happens is already destined to happen." "Who can go against your will?" "Hail, Lord Ram!" "Lord Ram.. - Hail, Lord Ram!" "Patience, duty, friend and women.." "..are appraised during bad times." "Hail, Lord Ram!" "Lord Ram. - Hail, Lord Ram!" "No matter what happens, always tread the path of truth." "If you're ignorant, you won't receive the divine message." "Lord Ram. - Hail, Lord Ram!" "As per one's thoughts.." "..one gets rewards from God." "Hail, Lord Ram!" "Lord Ram.. - Hail, Lord Ram!" "Lord is immortal and his tales are unending." "Everyone, from commoner to saint, chants his name." "Hail, Lord Ram!" "Lord Ram.. - Hail, Lord Ram!" "Hail, Lord Ram!" Bless you, son. Ganga, protect him from all evil. Such a nice voice and song! I was amazed! Bless you, son. I've never even looked at you properly. He has a glow on his face, like a sage's son. Shyam, where did you learn to recite the Ramayana so nicely? Sir, from no one. Hearing it in temples and from pilgrims I remembered what I liked and recited it. Had Radha been here, it'd have been so nice. She would have stopped troubling you from today. Where's she? Where are you taking me, sister? Why aren't you telling me? It's not something to tell, but to show. Meera? Shyam? Why didn't you tell me that you live here? I forgot. Did your mother make the pickle? Yes. And she said that, as soon as it's ready.. ..I should give it to you first. Radha, are you going? You didn't even show me that thing. You've already seen that thing and even know him! Thakur Durga Prasad, about turn! Colonel! Come, we were waiting for you. Look. - Wow! I'm sorry. Last night I went to a friend's house for dinner. That's why I couldn't come. Where are your family members? My sister, my sister-in-law and my daughter. Ganga! - Coming! Bring the offerings! - Yes! You just keep saying 'coming' and 'bringing'! Come on, make your move. Let me think. C'mon. Colonel, speak softly. - Okay. Here, brother. The Goddess's offerings. Glory to the Goddess! - Hail. Brother, how did you live without playing chess from last four days? I was very sad. Where's our little machine gun? Your lovable? - Yes. There she comes. Good morning. - Good morning, colonel uncle. Come here! Why did you say 'good morning' so morosely? Did you lose to someone? If anyone has told you anything, then tell me! I'll teach him a lesson! Then teach mom and dad a lesson! - What? Why? You had brought him from the carnival! Whom did you bring from the carnival? - Their new recruit. Wow! Our daughter speaks perfect military language! Who's he? He's an orphan boy. But he sings very well. Sister is mesmerized by his voice. Beware! I won't lose listening to you. Here's my move. Sister-in-law, why are you standing here like the Taj Mahal? Go and arrange for some tea. - I'll bring it. Also arrange for food. - And some sweets. So your important work has started! It's only chess all the time! What's there in chess that you two forget about the household.. ..and concentrate only on it? You too learn it, aunt. At least there'll be some peace in the house.. ..if not in the entire world. Listen to her! I'm talking to you two but she's giving the answers! Her height is so small, but her tongue is so long! Brother, why don't you 'court masala' her? Sister, not 'court masala', but 'court martial'. Yes. Didn't you understand? No, he didn't. Did you hear this, brother? This is why I say get her married and rid this house of her! Don't you understand? Quiet! Why did you make that move, colonel? Even Jai Ram can think of better moves than that. Here goes your queen. Who's playing the flute? - Their new recruit. Look, he ruined your move! Anyone there? Go and call that flute player. I'll teach him a lesson! Really, uncle? - Yes. I'll call him right away. - Yes, hurry up. Come. Where? - Colonel uncle has called you. Who's colonel uncle? Come with me, you'll find out everything. Were you playing the flute? - Yes. Why were you playing it? I play it whenever I feel like. What's your name? - Shyam. Even if your name is Shyam, that doesn't mean.. ..you should keep playing the flute like Lord Krishna. What's your education? - I'm completely illiterate. Illiterate? When my son was of your age.. ..he had cleared his 10th standard exams. After that, he did his B.A. and is a captain in the army now. Shyam! - Yes. Will you study? - Yes, sir. Let me finish talking first! Listen, your flute made me lose. I'll punish you for this. Come here! Play the flute again. - What? Yes, my child. If a flute can win my heart.. ..and make me lose in chess then there must be magic in it. Well done, son! I salute you! Sir, whenever you call me I come running here from Sudama shanty. I tried to teach Radha twice. First time, she welcomed me with a thorny plant. My hands were swollen for 4 days. And the second time, with an itching plant. Have a seat, teacher. How strange! I'm telling you about my problems but you're laughing! But I won't deny your request. But you'll have to be present when I teach her. It's very important. I was laughing at Radha's mischief. But Mr. Narayan Das, I haven't called you.. ..to teach Radha, but Shyam. Who's Shyam? Radha's mother has brought an orphan boy from our pilgrimage. We thought that if he learns something it'll be.. ..good for his future. How nice of you, sir. - I'll call him right now. Shyam. Yes, sir? - Come, dear. Shyam, you wish to study, right? - Yes, a lot. He's Mr. Narayan Das, your teacher from today. Greetings. - Bless you, son. If you concentrate on your studies you'll be very successful. So, shall we start your studies from tomorrow? As you wish. Where would you like to study? This open place, amidst nature. This secluded place will be perfect for studies. Son. - Yes? Write 'Om' first. Like this. It's a miracle! You've written 'Om' so beautifully! Before starting anything auspicious.. ..it's very important to take god's blessings. Some naughty boy is pelting stones from the tree! Come, let's go to some other place. 'Lord Hanuman saves his devotees from all calamities.' Meera, you? Where's Shyam? - Why? Mother has sent pickle for him. You and aunt are so concerned for Shyam. Yes. I told you that he had plucked mangoes for me. Yes. So, he has an absolute right on this pickle. But he has started studying from today. Look, the teacher is teaching him. So you shouldn't disturb him, right? - Not at all. Then give this pickle to me. I'll give it to him. I'll tell him that aunt has sent it. Okay? Yes, that'll be fine. Okay, I'm going now. These alphabets contain all knowledge.. ..and form the word order. So, I instruct you to memorize these alphabets. I'll memorize them right away and tell you. Catch the butterfly! Where are you fleeing? Come here! God! Catch it! Greetings, teacher. Where are you fleeing? Come here! It's come! Hail Lord, save me. Radha! - I was chasing the butterfly. Okay son, today's session is over. If possible, memorize the chapters. Bye, teacher. Won't you speak? Okay, don't speak! I too won't say anything! Brother Shyam! Shyam! Shyam! I've been yelling out your name since so long! What are you looking at here? That river. - Yes, even I can see the river. The river and the water in the river. And the fishes in the water. There are crocodiles too in this river. Do you get it? Come, let's go home. Home! Come on! Shyam. - Yes. How did your studies go? - Very nicely. I've learnt to read and write a lot of things. Well done! - Did you hear that? And our daughter used to say that.. ..Mr. Narayan Das doesn't know how to teach! By the way, where's she? Did she have her food? - No. No? Then call her. I can never understand her! When I went to call her, she said that.. ..she wouldn't eat until Shyam speaks to her. Radha! Radha, are you angry with me? Your dad just sat down to eat. Come, you eat a little too. Are you still angry? Okay, I apologise with folded hands. Come now at least. So you won't come or speak to me? Okay. You don't like my staying here, right? Okay then, I'll leave this house and go away. What's the matter, dear? I can't see Shyam anywhere. Don't worry about him. He does whatever he likes and goes wherever he wants. What? Does it mean that if he says he'd leave then he'd really do so? He's just like the birds. This branch today and that branch tomorrow. You can't trust him. No. My clothes? I had kept them here. Radha, what are you doing here? Why did you come here? - I like bathing here. And I like sitting here. Give me my clothes. - No! Brother Shyam, come fast! Where are you? Your teacher has come! - Give me my clothes fast! Your clothes? No! You'll first have to agree to everything I say. Okay, I beg you! My teacher has come! Please, give me my clothes! Okay then, promise me that you'll never leave our house and go. Okay, I'll never even mention it. My clothes. You'll always answer anything I ask and won't remain silent and angry. Do you agree? I agree. Give my clothes now. When you sit with teacher to study you won't sit alone.. ..but will let me sit with you and study too. Yes. What? Will you too study? Don't ask questions, say yes. Okay, you can sit and study too. Give my clothes now at least. And, at the carnival, you won't favor anyone else.. ..to sit on my favorite horse. Not at all. Do you want to ask anything else? No. Yes, one more thing. You won't pluck mangoes for anyone. And if you want to eat pickles.. ..then you'll eat the ones made at home by aunt. Yes, I agree to everything. I'll stop eating pickles. Give my clothes now. Give me. Dad, help! I'll die! Oh God! What happened? Are you hurt? My clothes! 'Cat, bat, rat, mat.' 'Pen, hen, ten, men.' Wow! You've written what I haven't even taught you! Son of Goddess Saraswati you're like Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar! Great! Greetings, teacher. - Greetings. I too will study. - Will you? How strange! So God has given you some sense at last. You're grown up now.. ..and it's really necessary for you to study. Sit down. You ruined my alphabets! - I didn't do it purposely. Children, stop talking and write. Till where have you read? Till the 7th chapter. - The 7th chapter? Ok, chapter 7. Write this 8th chapter now. Well done! Okay son, it's now time for me to go to school. I'm going. What happened, teacher? Nothing, dear. I feel as if something is jumping around. A frog! So this was your doing! I'll go and tell your dad that.. ..you haven't stopped your mischief even now! I'll go right now! And inform him. Bye, teacher. - Bye! Teacher, listen! This was wrong of you, Radha! - What did I do? Such a big teacher got scared of such a small frog! So what's my fault in that? Leave all that.. ..play the flute. - Not at all! Please, play it. Radha, you've insulted teacher! I won't play the flute! Then don't play it! I too won't let you study! Not today, tomorrow or day after! Radha, I was coming to meet you. But Shyam plays the flute so nicely. Right? Come, you listen too. Radha! Radha! Play it for her! Radha! Play it! "Shyam, your flute.." "..calls out the name of Radha." "Shyam, your flute.." "..calls out the name of Radha." "But people slander Meera for no reason." "Shyam, your flute calls out the name of Radha." "Shyam, your flute calls out the name of Radha." "But people slander Meera for no reason." "But people slander Meera for no reason."

Meera, please forgive me! Radha! Meera! - Radha! Meera! Meera, please forgive me! Ram Kishen, you haven't paid your tax since the last 6 years. I'll exempt half of it, but you'll have to pay half. - Yes, sir. Hello Sir, letter for you. Come, Lakhan. I was waiting for you. I'm expecting replies to many letters. For me, your letter is like a telegram. As soon as I get it, I bring it here. Accountant. - Yes? - There's good news. The boy's family has written from Motipur. - Congratulations, sir! Give Lakhan a tip. Lakhan always brings good news. Sister, where's everybody? Look, there's a letter from Motipur. Landlord Rampal Singh is very rich. His son is very handsome, 22 years old and their horoscopes match. Our Radha will live like a queen there. Hail Sita and Ram! Oh God! Brother, I knew that, this time God would definitely listen to me! The boy will be coming to see Radha with his uncle.. ..by the 4 o'clock train. - Good! Sister, may God make this marriage take place. God will always do what's right. But our hospitality should be classy. Yes. Bindu. - Yes, aunt? Go and tell Nathu to massage the horse with oil.. ..and clean the cart and keep it ready. And tell the accountant, that the train will arrive at 4.. ..and he should reach there on time. Understand? - Yes, aunt. Go. I will call the colonel right now and discuss the finances. Listen. Send Shyam with the accountant. There should be someone from the family to receive them. Yes, you're right. Ganga, my Radha is really very fortunate. Dress her in that beautiful red sari.. ..and deck her up with a lot of jewelry. Understand? - Yes. Listen! What have you decided about the food? You make such nice sweets. Go and make that. And we have almond sherbet with us. We'll serve that first and decide about dinner later. Understand? - Yes. What time does the train arrive? - 4 o'clock. 4 o'clock? Oh God! Jai Ram! Bindu! Where are you all? The train arrives at 4 o'clock! Finish everything quickly! What happened, dear? Jai Ram, the clock.. Yes, the clock is nice. I can see it. It had stopped and I was winding it. Nobody's bothered! I understood. But no one should know that I wound the clock. - No. Don't worry, even if nobody asks.. ..I won't say that you didn't wind the clock. - What? Jai Ram. - Yes? There. - Yes, there. Thakur. - Yes, sir? We'll have to ask Mr. Durga. - What? Why did he play such a cruel joke on us? - Why did he? Neither did he send a cart nor any man to the station to receive us. I'm exhausted walking in the sun! Sir, don't worry. Phoolpur is just a little distance away. Little distance? Where is it? - Look there, near those fields. Sir, by the grace of God you've got a chance to walk. It'll be good for your health. How strange! Lulla, if you're tired, shall I carry you? - No! Who's this ill-mannered person? Go and see, Thakur. Girl, can't you see? Motipur's landlord Rampal Singh's brother-in-law landlord Dharamjeet Singh and his son Lalpal Singh.. ..alias Lulla, have come to this village today! Yes, you're being talked about a lot in Phoolpur. What? - Yes. A lot of arrangements are being made there for your welcome. You've come to see landlord Durga's only daughter Radha, right? - Yes. Go straight that way. Maybe number 13 will be lucky for the girl. Number 13? What do you mean? I mean, your number is 13. From 1 to 13. Don't you understand? No, we don't. - I shouldn't tell you.. ..that 12 boys have come before you and refused. You too will find it out for yourselves. If one has been deceived once he should take every step carefully. Why are you talking in riddles? Tell us clearly what you want to say. - Yes. I will, but don't tell them that Kamli told you all this. No, we won't. What's the matter? They won't show you the girl. Why? - Because poor Radha is a little dark. She's dark! - Dark! Dark! - Yes. She'll look better with a bit of powder and makeup. But it'll be difficult to cure her eye ailment. What? She has an eye ailment? Thakur, you said she was very beautiful! She was beautiful. If she didn't have chicken pox she'd have looked better. She had chicken pox too? - It's all God's will. Illness never heralds its arrival. But you can put on dark glasses. The poor, crippled girl will get some support at least. Is she also crippled? But they'll present Radha to you in such a way.. ..that you won't find any flaw in her. How? Through sweets and almond sherbet. Sweets and sherbet? Wow! But, after you have them.. ..your happiness will turn to sorrow. - How? There'll be intoxicants mixed in the sweets and sherbet. But how do you know all that? - Me? I'm their maidservant's daughter. I was grinding the intoxicants this morning. Are you all scared? Radha's aunt is there. She'll explain everything to you properly. Don't you understand? Oh God! There's the landlord's buggy! Don't mention my name. My respects. Is that the landlord's buggy? We won't go there to be fooled! Come on! Sir, please wait. - C'mon. No, we won't go! Please wait for my sake. No! - I'm asking you so fondly. Please, agree. Greetings, Thakur. - Greetings, accountant. Good that we met you on the way. But why are you going back to the station? Accountant, what have you done? Why did you play such a joke on us? You didn't send anyone or any buggy to receive us. We're tired of walking. This is landlord Lalpal Singh alias Mr. Lulla. Greetings. - And this is landlord Dharamjeet Singh. He's the boy's uncle. Greetings. - I don't understand anything. So this is how Durga Prasad welcomes us! We're going back! Come on! No, sir! I beg you! Everyone's waiting for you there. And I was on my way to the station to receive you. But your train arrived a little early today. The train arrived on time. You are late! This is a terrible insult! We won't see the girl! We're going back! Let's go! - No, sir! I'll be left nowhere! I, accountant Dharam Das, beg you in the name of virtue! Please agree, sir. Please, come with us. I bow to you. - Stand straight! What are you doing? I've seen such melodramas before! We won't go with you! Like the way we came we'll go back walking to the station! Come on! Mr. Lulla, please don't be so angry. Everyone's waiting for you back at the house. If you don't go, they'll feel bad. Sir, let's go. The boy's right. Please come. Okay. - Please come. It's our good fortune that you've come here. Come, son. Landlord, please take a seat. Okay. - Please forgive their mistake. If anything like this happens again, let me know. I'm the girl's aunt. - Well? Don't you understand? - I understand, sister. Did you understand? You didn't. Touch aunt's feet. My respects. - Bless you, son. May you live long. You and Radha will look like Sita and Ram. Have a seat. Please, take a seat. - Jai Ram! Bindu! Where's everyone gone? I'll be right back. - Okay. Your house is so nice. Don't worry, I remember everything. What are you doing there? Come here. Keep it here. Sir, these sweets are homemade. They're filled with dry fruits. Radha's mother makes them very nicely. Just taste it and see. - Yes. Son, you have some too. Don't feel shy. Make yourself at home. Sir, you have it too. - We will, aunt. Let him rest a bit first. Yes, they've walked in the sun. Almond sherbet has arrived too. Almond sherbet? - Yes. It's homemade. It's also filled with dry fruits. Don't you understand? - I understood. Call the girl first. Wow! So the guests have arrived! Greetings! Good morning! I'm retired colonel Sohan Singh. Durga Prasad is like my younger brother. Please forgive me for arriving a little late. - Never mind. People always come late here. - What? Nothing. Just call the girl quickly. That's the reason we called you here. Yes, that's the custom nowadays. The girl and the boy see each other before marriage. Do you understand? Yes. Till then, have something to eat. Don't you understand? - I understood, aunt. Then have something. - You eat. Please call the girl quickly. We've to catch the evening train. The girl will come right now. Thakur, - Yes sir. They keep saying the girl will be coming but don't even call her! That girl we met on the road was right. Sweets, almond sherbet.. Do these people consider us fools? What did you say? - Nothing. We're just waiting for the girl. - I won't open the door! I won't come out! - Radha, dear. What's this insanity? They are our guests. Please, come out once. You can say no to them later. Listen, dear. What's the matter? The girl hasn't come till now. She'll come right now. We agreed to show you the girl. Isn't that enough? She's a girl, so she'll obviously feel shy. And it takes time to dress up and put on jewelry. Don't you understand? - I understand everything, sister. Sir. Sir, there seems to be something wrong. Please excuse me, I'll be right back. Till then, have some sweets and the sherbet. Call the girl first, we'll have everything after that. She'll come, but love is something big too. Here, have some sweets. - No! Have some. - No! Have some. - No! Have some. - No! Colonel, you did the right thing. Lulla, why aren't you having anything? No, I won't eat. - Here, have some sweets. Sweeten your mouth. - No! Just one more sweet. Have it. Have some sherbet. - Have it. Okay then, have some sherbet. You'll have to drink the sherbet. That's enough, mom. - Son, I'm not your mom but your aunt. My aunt? - Yes. Where's the well? - Outside. Why? Do you want to have a bath? No. What's happening? - Have some sweets Nau, even you're eating it! Who'll take care of us then? I'm there, sir. Don't worry. Sir, why are you jumping around? This is a house, not a circus. - What are you talking? Something's wrong with my stomach! I'm seeing a circus in the house! I can see 2 uncles! 2 uncles? You can see 2 uncles, Nau! Here, have some sweets, sir. - Get away. You can see 2 uncles and I can see 2 doors! The girl we met on the way was speaking the truth! Colonel sir! Colonel sir! Colonel sir! What? - Yes. Remain seated, I'll be right back. Remain seated? Okay, if you say so. Nau, have they gone? - Yes. This is the right moment. Come Lulla. - Yes, uncle? Let's go from here. - Come on. Let's go. Else, the effect of the sweets and sherbet will keep increasing. Where have they gone? Nau, wait! Landlord, come back! Teacher's stooge, no studies today? Are you angry with me? You're having fun here. But do you know how angry your parents are with your behavior today? It's all because of you. - Because of me? Why did you have to bring them back to see me? But the boy was so nice. What wrong thing did I do? You won't understand - Why? Because you're stupid! Good morning, Mr. Narayan Das. Good morning. - Where are you going in such a hurry? I just taught Radha and Shyam and am going to the school now. I'm getting late. What happened? - I mean to say I'm late. Okay, you mean you're getting late? How's your student Shyam doing? - Very well. Has he been given an injection? - No. I mean he's very good and intelligent. He grasps even more than what I teach him. Very good. And the strange thing is that he has also changed Radha. Changed? - Yes. What I mean is.. I always thought that Radha had no future in studies. But she's changed so much now. She concentrates on her studies. I'm very satisfied. Mr. Narayan Das, are you satisfied? - Yes. You were getting something. I was getting late. - Yes, you were getting late. Then you may go. - Yes, I'll proceed. Please. Late! Proceed! What's this? You keep studying all the time! Stop it! Teacher told me to stop only when the chapter is over. Remove your hand. - I said stop, so stop. Is this one of your conditions? - Consider it that. This is not fair! Every time I've to keep agreeing to your conditions! I'd have been so glad if you'd got married to Mr. Lulla! Let me tell you right now.. ..If you say such a thing again I'll never talk to you! Look at me! Listen, mom was telling aunt.. ..that only a fortunate girl finds a good husband. - That's true. Even you'll find a very good husband. - Really? But for some, it turns out to be a misfortune. So many girls don't get husbands of their choice. Do you know? - I know. But my heart says that you'll find the husband of your choice. Really? - Yes. Bless you! But if he leaves me and runs away? Only a fool will do that. But suppose he does leave me and run away? Then I'll catch him and won't let him go. How? - Like this. 'God will do something!' He will, but you should do something too! Colonel, why are you running away? Come here and listen to me! All the village girls are getting married! Even Meera is getting married! Don't you understand? I understood everything, sister. Just bring the sweets. - Why? I've found a prince for Radha. - Really? What kind of a move is this, colonel? - It's not a move.. ..but a miracle, Durga. I've found a gem of a boy. He's one in a million. If you wish the wedding can be done today. But who's he? - Shyam. Shyam? - Shyam? Yes.. Shyam. What makes you think of Shyam? Radha always troubles him. They're sworn enemies. - Enemy? Maybe this enmity is called love. I've seen it with my own eyes. An unconditional love has developed between them.. ..which they might not understand right now. But, after their marriage.. ..that love will develop into a bond that will never break. And he always says there's no son in our family. He'll stay in our house both as a son and a son-in-law. Very nice. I had never even thought about it. Even I didn't. - But I do think! About the people, the norms of the world.. ..the family's prestige and customs and traditions. I agree that Shyam is very handsome and intelligent. He also loves Radha a lot. But what will you tell people during the wedding.. ..about who the boy's father is and his caste? Answer me! - Listen, sister. Had Shyam been my son.. ..and of my caste what would you have said then? That would have been a different matter. Then consider Shyam my son. I'm ready to legally adopt him. Now tell me. Shyam. Shyam.. Madam, haven't you gone to bed as yet? You're awake yourself, but are advising me! Teacher will be very happy if I write all this. Radha troubles you a lot. That's why you have to study at night, right? - No. Radha concentrates on her studies a lot nowadays. - Really? Tell me one thing, how do you like Radha? I like her lot. Why? I asked just like that. You haven't drunk your milk as yet. Here, have it. Drink the milk and go to sleep. Pampered girl.. ..where are you going so early in the morning? You stopped me. I'll go and study. Mr. Narayan Das has left. So, who will you study with? With Shyam. - Shyam? O God, please give this girl some sense! Listen! From today, you won't eat.. ..study or roam around with Shyam. Understand? No, I don't understand! Why? What do you mean 'why'? Your marriage has been fixed. What? My marriage? I won't get married! - Then go and tell everyone. Yes, I'll tell everyone! Tell everyone that you won't marry anyone.. ..not even Shyam. - What? "I am the same, even the mirror is the same." "I am the same, even the mirror is the same." "But what has happened?" "Everything appears new to me." "Everything appears new to me." "I am the same, even the mirror is the same." "I've started singing and humming." "I've started singing and humming." "What direction am I going in?" "My heart and body are the same." "My heart and body are the same." "But what has happened?" "Everything appears new to me." "Everything appears new to me." "I am the same, even the mirror is the same." "The sparrow calls out to its beloved." "The sparrow calls out to its beloved." "I too feel like flying to my beloved." "My heart is the same, even my heartbeats are the same." "My heart is the same, even my heartbeats are the same." "But what has happened?" "Everything appears new to me." "Everything appears new to me." "I am the same, even the mirror is the same." "I am the same, even the mirror is the same." "But what has happened?" "Everything appears new to me." "Everything appears new to me." "Everything appears new to me." Radha? - Where were you lost? What are you looking at? The trees swaying in the wind. The flowing waves. Those flying birds. All of them are going somewhere. Seems like they're all calling out to me. 'Shyam.. '..why are you sitting silently?' 'Come with us.' But where? What do you mean by 'where'? We just have to keep on treading on known and unknown paths. If we know where we'll start and where we'll go.. ..what fun will be left then? We just have to keep on going.. ..sometimes in the day and sometimes at night. And, in the night, many companions look at me from the stars above. Different people, villages, fields, mountains.. I'll go, Radha. - No, you won't go anywhere now. Mom has tied you in a bond of love with so much difficulty. Bond? - Yes. Aren't you happy in our house? I am. - Are you angry with me? Angry? Why? I used to trouble you a lot. But I don't do it anymore. What are you looking at? Radha.. ..you seem to have changed nowadays. And you? Me? I don't know. Okay, close your eyes. - Why? Just do it. A new flute? Hold it to your lips and play. Play it. What? What happened? - You won't understand. Why? - Because you are.. What happened? I too am stupid! 'But my heart says that you'll surely get the husband of your choice.' 'Really?' 'Bless you!' Radha? What happened? All the land till, that hill belongs to us. That mango and guava garden.. ..and that vegetable field too. You'll have to manage all of them. Me? - Yes, you. You're studying a lot now. Accounts, writing and comprehension. The accountant will explain everything to you. Come, let's go. Come. Come, sir. Please, be seated. 'Sir'? - Yes. Stop all this frolicking around now. Why? - Because you're about to become this family's son-in-law. What? - Yes. You'll be getting married to Radha. Getting married to Radha? - Yes. But nobody told me anything. Not even madam. If someone considers one his own, he enjoys a right on him.. ..and feels no need to explain anything to him. You can say that now you're tied in this bond now. Bond? You're now caught and surrounded on all sides! Try and get out of this confinement now! Come on, parrot, say 'Radhe Shyam'. Will he learn everything in one day? First give him something to eat. Here, have this green chilli guava and flour. Then say 'Radhe Shyam'. Jai Ram, during our pilgrimage last year.. ..we had mixed so many red chilies in Shyam's lentil and.. Come, sir. Jai Ram, where did you catch this parrot? Free it. - No, sir. Why not? A bird flies in the air and lives on trees. Why did you catch it? Free it. How can I? I bought it from a gypsy for one rupee. The cage costs 5 rupees. - So you bought it to imprison it? Won't it be distressed? - Why will it be distressed? It'll eat as much as it wants and live in comfort. After a long time, Radha has found a parrot like this. She likes it a lot. Here, have chili and say 'Radhe Shyam'. 'Say Radhe Shyam.' 'You can say that now you're tied in this bond now.' 'Tied in this bond!' 'Tied in this bond!' 'Tied in this bond!' 'I bought it from a gypsy for one rupee. The cage costs 5 rupees.' 'A cage!' "From where have you come?" 'Why will it be distressed?' 'It'll eat to its fill and live in comfort.' 'Live in comfort?' "Where am I going?" "One who doesn't know that is the happiest." "These moving winds are making a sound." "And these flying birds are living their lives to the fullest." "O birds.." "..take wings like a bird and fly away." "Keep on singing and humming, my friend." What did you say? He's nowhere to be found? Yes, sir. We inquired at every house.. ..and searched the fields, gardens, lakes, rivers and everywhere else. But we didn't find him anywhere. But where did he go without telling us and why? We were about to give you everything. Shyam.. ..If that was your intention.. ..why didn't you leave at the carnival itself? Why did you ruin my Radha's life? Radha! - My child! What's happened to my daughter? Call the doctor! Don't worry, everything will be fine. Why are you two sitting quietly? Play your chess now! Brother, we didn't force him to do anything. You said that Radha and Shyam love each other. Then why did he go away furtively? It's I who's unlucky! But what's Radha's fault in all this.. ..that she's having to pay so dearly? Colonel, I beg you. Think and do something. She hasn't had any food or drink since the past four days. I can't bear to see Radha like this, brother! Dear, I can understand your sorrow very well. This world is like that. Everyone in it has some sorrow. But a true human being is one who controls his sorrow.. ..and tries to keep others happy. My child. I had taken the responsibility for your marriage. So, besides you, he has wronged me too. He has betrayed me too. I promise you.. ..that I'll find him and bring him back. Don't you trust your colonel uncle? I promise you. Yes, I promise you. that The one who has left you.. ..will come back one day and marry you. That's enough. Have courage. "Keep singing and humming, my friend." "Keep singing and humming, my friend." Shyam? Stop the cart! Shyam! Sister? Sister? Naughty boy, where did you go away quietly? Sister, I.. - I'll teach you a lesson right now.. ..and knock some sense in you! Say, 'Hail Saraswati, the Goddess of the arts..' '..and Lakshmi, the Goddess of wealth'. Come on, start. Boss, shall I climb the tree? - You? Yes, I always climb the tree. - But it's been decided that.. Okay, let's see what you do. - I'll show you right now. Banke. - Yes? Be careful. - Don't worry. Just watch. Watch your foot. - Just watch.. So all the girls are pleading in front of lord Krishna. 'You are very mischievous and shameless.' You are very mischievous and shameless. You always do whatever you want. You always use your strength. And today, you stole our clothes. 'Return our clothes!' - Return our clothes! I won't. - Return our clothes! You're such a bother! You're so mischievous and shameful! - Wow, Champa! You said it as nicely as I wrote it! Come on, say it. 'I've got this chance today with such difficulty..' '..and brought you to such a condition.' 'How will you come out of the water without your clothes?' 'Shall I tell you how?' What are you waiting for? Who'll play Kishen, you or I? Why don't you say it? Boss, you're saying it, so how can I interrupt? - Quiet! Okay, I'm quiet! Champa, say.. 'Shyam, return my clothes.' - Shyam, return my clothes. I will, but I have a few conditions. I agree to all your conditions. Tell me. You'll never hide my flute again. Agreed? Agreed. - You'll come whenever I call you. Agreed? - Agreed. 'Whenever I will ask you something you'll answer me.' 'You won't remain silent and show your temper. Agreed?' 'Agreed. - You won't sit alone to study with teacher..' '..but will let me sit too.' "Where did Kanha go after promising to meet me?" "Radha is standing on the banks of Yamuna since so long." "But our night of union has still not arrived." "But our night of union has still not arrived." "My beloved has gone to a far off land" "And I cry every day." "And I cry everyday." "My beloved has gone to a far off land" "And I cry everyday." "The rains haven't come yet" "But our night of union has still not arrived." "Shyam, please forgive my mistakes." "Come back and punish me in any way you please." "Come back and punish me in any way you please." "Shyam, please forgive my mistakes." "Come back and punish me in any way you please." "I won't trouble you anymore." "Our night of union has still not arrived." "Where did Kanha go after promising to meet me?" "Radha is standing on the banks of Yamuna." "Our night of union has still not arrived." "Our night of union has still not arrived." Meera? What are you doing here? This is my in-laws' place. - I see. But what are you doing here? I travel around with the drama people and have come here today. And see what a coincidence, I've met you! How are you? - I'm fine. Everything fine in the house? - Yes. Today is our first show. You come too, you'll be very happy. I won't be able to come. But I'm glad we met. I got a chance to ask you something. May I ask? - Yes. I saw all the props for the wedding being put up.. ..and then taken down again. If you didn't want to marry, why didn't you say so before? Just because your name is Shyam is it your duty to hurt Radha? Meera! - You're so coldhearted, Shyam! That's enough, madam. - 'Madam'? Go and bring green chilies. Why are you sitting so quietly? Why aren't you eating? Why don't you have some rice? Eat double. In this show, you're playing a lover. If you eat this rice, the public will go mad about your performance. 'Play it for her!' Shyam.. ..why did you leave your food? I ate enough. Who's this 'madam'? Radha's mother. And Radha? - Radha? Madam and sir's daughter. Who are 'madam' and 'sir'? What relation do you have with them? What are you hiding? Why don't you tell me clearly what you're hiding from me? I can't hide anything from you, sister. Remember.. ..the last time I left you without telling you? - Don't go, Shyam! Wait, Shyam! Don't go! Wait! Shyam! You got so much love, adoration and respect. But you left everything and came here without telling anyone! How cruel! It's not that, sister. - Then what is it? They gave you everything and so much love. Yet, you hurt them so terribly! I don't know all that, sister. I only know.. ..that I can't endure living in a bond. You fool, do you call this a bond? Even God likes being tied in a bond of love, adoration and.. ..affection, not to speak of us humans. And, with this bond.. ..between them husband and wife erect their own small and beautiful world.. ..through which this whole world runs. Shyam.. Have you ever thought about that girl? What would she be going through? What did you punish her for? Radha. Radha. Only God knows how all this happened and why. But we should forget whatever happened. Your father has selected a very nice boy for you.. ..from a nice house and family. - Mom! Radha! Yes, mom. Don't you know that I'm already married? So what if I didn't complete the rituals? I've already accepted someone as my husband. So he's my husband now whether he comes or not. I'll wait for him not only in this birth.. ..but also in my next seven births. May God fulfill your wish! I'm blessed.. ..that you're my daughter. "Arrogant Shyam." "You became the king of Mathura." "But Radha kept crying." "Crazy girl! "Shyam, why did you leave Gokul village?"

"Just mend the broken hearts." "Just mend the broken hearts." "We were compelled to part from each other." "Radha, we were compelled to part." "One who realizes and rectifies his mistake" "is hailed as an intelligent person." "Arrogant Shyam!" "Arrogant Shyam!" "My Radha!" "My Kanha!" "My Kanha!" "My Radha!" "My Radha! - My Kanha!" "My Radha!" Where are you going, Shyam? Let him go, boss. Let him go. - What are you saying, Champa? People are making a lot of noise. The arrogant Shyam will have to perform again. - Not anymore. Radha's love has drowned Shyam's arrogance. That was the play's grand finale. But real life has started now. Remember that. Go, Shyam. Be happy. Go. Radha! Who? Radha! Shyam! - Radha! Shyam! Shyam! Radha! Shyam! Shyam! Shyam! - Radha, please forgive me! I'll never leave you again! You'll never go again!
