"To prove l killed them, "l shall state some facts which only l and the police know. "Christmas, brand name of ammo, Super-X. "Ten shots were fired. "The boy was on his back with his feet to the car. "The girl..." Would you read that, please? "The girl was on her right side, feet to the west. "Fourth of July. "One, girl was wearing patterned slacks. "The boy was also shot in the knee. "Brand name of ammo was Western. "Here is part of a cipher. "The other two parts of this cipher are being mailed to the editors of "the Vallejo Times and S. F. Examiner.

Today's August first. He wants his code in the afternoon edition. lf the Examinerdoesn't have the balls to run it, we scoop the Bay. Al, this man is talking about shooting 12 people. And not running this might make him do that. lfwe run it, we might be setting a very dangerous precedent. AL: Oh, come on, now, it's newsworthy. Well, giving some sick bastard a soapbox, what does that say to people? Back up. ls this Vallejo story true? Do we know that? -Paul? -What? l cover crime in Vallejo? Yeah, l cover crime in Vallejo.

You're not scared ofthe Zodiac? VIC: Heck no, he's only shooting those farm kids. What scares me is those hippies out in the Haight with theirfree love and weird clothes. RADIO HOST: We've got Alfred from Vacaville. ALFRED: You know, I think that was really offensive. It's notjust farm kids. These are nice, clean-cut young people. RADIO HOST: Hey, nobody's downplaying the loss of human life here, Alfred. ALFRED: Well, that last guy was. We have good solid communities out here in the North Bay. Unlike in the city where you have Satanists running around. RADIO HOST: Well, you bring up a good question. Is the Zodiac a Satanist? Amberfrom Oakland, what do you think? AMBER: I don't really know, but I thought that code they printed didn't look very Christian. But I think the bigger problem is that the papers shouldn't have printed anything that the Zodiac has been doing. That they'rejust printing all that stuffto sell more newspapers. RADIO HOST: Well, the Zodiac did demand they print his letters or he'd kill more people. AMBER: Yeah, but he would have done it anyway, whetherthey printed it or not, I think. RADIO HOST: An interesting point. So, what do you think he'll do next? (GUN FlRES) (PHONE RINGING) MAN: San Francisco Police Department. WOMAN: Yes. There's a fight in a cab!

The victim's name is Paul Stine. Dousette pronounced him at 10:10. Suspect fired one shot to the back of the head. Driver's wallet and car keys are missing. How'd you know his name? Leroy, there, came down from Yellow Cab to lD him. Neighborhood's pretty high-end for this kind of thing, so l already set up transpo for the cab. -Coroner's here. -Any witnesses? Kids who called it in saw the suspect from that window. -Did they hear a shot? -No. They first saw him in the front seat, thought he was a drunk fighting with the driver. Oldest kid ran downstairs to get a better look from the dining room, described him as a white male, glasses, crew-cut, stocky, and wearing a darkjacket. Wait, l thought someone said he was black. That's the description that went out to radio cars. -We already corrected it. -Oh, well, that's good. -You guys need anything else? -No. Get out of here. Thanks. Happy Birthday. -Wait, it's your birthday? -Yep. -That's great. Happy birthday. -Thanks. -Body or scene? -lt's your birthday, l'll take the body.

Okay. l'm your shooter, Negro male adult, who also happens to be a stocky, crew-cut Caucasian. l flag a cab. l give him this address. Did l give him this address? Who's got the fare book? OFFlCER: Right here. Washington and Maple. That's one block east. Lighting's the same over here, so maybe l see someone walking their dog. You don't want any witnesses so you tell him to go down a block. He pulls over. l wait for him to put it in park because l'm smart and l don't want him hitting the accelerator when l shoot him. May l? He stops, puts it in park, boom. l shoot him on the right side, he slumps right? Maybe you've got your hand on his collarwhen you shoot. All right. So, eitherway, l just dumped a quart of blood in the front seat. -So, why do you get in the front seat? -For the money. But he's dead. You could just reach over the seat, pull out his wallet. You don't have to go anywhere near the blood. So, why'd he get in the front seat? -l'm an idiot. -But you're not an idiot. You waited for him to put it in park. -Right. Thank you. -Yeah, sure. -Can l see that? -Yeah. l am an idiot. l just killed a man for $8.25. lt's his third fare of the night.

There's your rag the kids talked about. So he got in the front seat to tear off a piece of the shirt. -ls this on the record? -Well, what do you think? He confirms the Vallejo and Napa killings. Gets worse. Robert, do you have a deadline? What does he mean, it gets worse? Read the last part. TOSCHl: "School children make nice targets. "l think l shall wipe out a school bus some morning.

Dave, just one thing. ls it true they got a print off the cab? Yeah, we got a partial in blood. -But that is not for publication. -Hey, hey, come on. Hey, it's me. Did he say they got a print? Partial. Whoa. Dude, he wears his gun like Bullitt. No, McQueen got that from Toschi. Does he think that Zodiac's gonna send another code? 'Cause l think Zodiac's gonna send another code. Jesus Harold Christ on rubber crutches, Bobby. What are you doing? You're doing that thing, the thing we discussed, the thing that l don't like. Starts with an "L." -Oh, looming. -Yeah. ln cooperation with SFPD, we will run the Zodiac letter without including the threat on school children. We don't want to start a city-wide panic so l'm asking all ofyou to please keep this confidential. Just go about your daily business. Thank you. l packed you your carrots and your celery and peanut butter, okay? -Dad, you don't have to wait with me. -l know. You knowwhat? You knowwhat? l'm gonna drive him today, okay? Come on. What's that? Similarities in the lowercase "r's." And that? lt is you waiting in the hall ifyou speak again. l have to concentrate. Sorry. "Sorry" counts as speaking. There are similarities in the lowercase "r's." We have to release the bus threat. -lt'll screw us. -We're already screwed. We just went from "Routine Cabbie Shooting" to "Mass Murderer Targets Kids." The Zodiac Killer has come to San Francisco. Confirmation tonight, from the San Francisco Police Department that in his latest haunting letter, which takes credit forthe murder of cab driver Paul Stine, the Zodiac has threatened to, "Wipe out a school bus "and pick offthe kiddies as they come bouncing out."

We're playing catch up, Jack. l'd like to set up a meeting with your survivor, Michael Mageau. l can't. He skipped town. The only guy who's seen Zodiac without a mask is missing? When he was still in the hospital we could show him lineups all day long. As soon as he got out, he split. Really? Why? l don't think he wanted to have anything to do with this. Can you send us everything that you have? Well, the road goes both ways. Now, we need that print you lifted from the cab and we should have been in on the handwriting. l apologize. Things have been moving fast. Who should I talk to in Napa so we can coordinate? Talk to Ken Narlow. We really should have been in on the handwriting. ARMSTRONG: I apologize. Things have been moving fast. Listen, we're gonna need your scene photos. Can't help you. Ken, I don't want to get into ajurisdictional thing here. No, no, no, no, no. We didn't have a crime scene. The ranger that found the kids literally swept everything into a picnic blanket. All we have are the Wing Walker prints. The what? Boot prints to and from the crime scene were made by size 10-and-a-half Wing Walkers, military-style boots sold only at military PXs designed to walk on the wings of planes. And you can't buy at a PX without a military ID, so our suspect could be military. Did you guys narrow your list off of this? -Yeah. -Did Vallejo? l don't know. l don't work in Vallejo. l work here. Great. l'm gonna need photos of those boot prints. Sure, if you send me the handwriting. l thought Questioned Documents already did. Nope. Vallejo's got them, not us. All right. l'll have Questioned Documents... Forget it. l'll telefax it to you. We don't have telefax yet. -Okay, l'll put it in the mail. -We'll mail ours, too. And call Mulanax in Vallejo. -Maybe he can get you a mimeo. -Right. Why don't you just get a photo off the original plaster cast? We'd have to wait, because they don't have a fax. We don't have a fax, either. Look, l'm just trying to get us coordinated. Have you called Solano Sheriff's Office? Why would l call Solano? Because the two kids that got killed last Christmas were Solano's. l thought they were Vallejo. No, they were over the county line so you're gonna need to coordinate with them, too. Okay. Bill. Can l have a word with you? TOSCHl: Where did you see this guy? We got the call to circle the scene and look for a Negro male adult. ARMSTRONG: Where was he? On Jackson. Heading east. About the middle of the block. And this is three minutes after the shooting? Give or take. Yeah. TOSCHl: And you were heading east orwest? We were going west. All right, so you're on Jackson going west. So the cab was one block catty-corner southwest? -Correct. -Did you slow down? -Of course we slowed down. -All right. Listen, Dispatch said it was a Negro male. TOSCHl: That was corrected. No, but at the time they hadn't changed it. This guy was white. Right, not in a hurry. Kind of lumbering along like... ARMSTRONG: Lumbering? What do you mean, "lumbering"? -Shuffling. -Stocky? Had a crew cut? Yeah, that's all correct. Listen, it was dark. The guy was wearing a darkjacket. There's no way... He would have been covered in blood. TOSCHl: Did you stop him? Did you talk to him? -Yes? No? -No. You need to get with a sketch artist. We have to put out a new composite right away.

Blue Rock Springs. -Lake Herman. -Wash-ington and Cherry? You think? No. l'm reading this book, Homicide Investigation by Lemoyne Snyder... -"Leymone." -...and he says you look for patterns, -so l'm looking for patterns. -No. You can't think of this case in normal police terms. -Why not? -You got four crime scenes. Solano, Vallejo, Berryessa, and here. Not a single usable print at the first three or in any of the letters? How does our master criminal come to the city and leave a bloody latent? l mean, assuming the gloves are his, he shoots the cabbie and then takes them off? ROBERT: So it's not his print? Maybe, maybe not. You're missing the point. -The point is the first attack... -David Faraday and Betty Jensen. They both die. From there on out, he only manages to kill the girls. -Not for lack of trying. -Not for lack of trying. Mageau lives, Ferrin dies. Hartnell lives, Shepard dies. He gets so caught up with the women he forgets to finish off the men. Plus, they're all couples and all on lover's lanes. -Paul Stine is not. -Exactly. Single, male cab driver on Washington and Cherry doesn't fit. Doesn't fit. So, why does Zodiac kill him? He's breaking the pattern. (RlNGlNG) Yeah? ARMSTRONG: Someone claiming to be Zodiac called Oakland PD a half-hour ago. He says he's gonna call in on Jim Dunbar's morning show in three hours. On television? He wants Melvin Belli on to counsel him. All right. All right. Let's go wake up Melvin. Animal crackers? Glove box. MELVlN: Are these windows bulletproof? Yes, Melvin.

You want to live, don't you? Well, this is your passport. How long have you been having these headaches? Since I killed a kid. -Do you have blackouts? -Yes. -Do you have fits? -No. I just have headaches. Did you attempt to call one other time when F. Lee Bailey was with us two or three weeks ago? Yes. And why did you want to talk to Mr. Bailey? Why do you wanna talk to me, Sam? -I don't want to be hurt. -Why is he calling? -Hey, just a second, buddy. -I don't wanna go to the gas chamber. You won't get hurt if you talk to me. And you're not going to the gas chamber. l wouldn't think they would ask for capital punishment. We should ask the District Attorney. Do you want me to do that, Sam? Do you want me to talk to the District Attorney? (SCREAMING) What was that, Sam? I did not say anything. MELVIN: We heard a scream. That was my headache. You sound like you're in a great deal of pain. My head aches. I'm so sick. I'm gonna kill them. -Oh, okay. -I'm gonna kill those kids! Fantastic. MELVIN: Sam? -Let's meet and talk. Just us. -Okay. How about Old St. Mary's Church in Chinatown? No. In front ofthe Daly City St. Vincent de Paul at 10:30. l'll see you there. (PHONE HANGlNG UP) Take care ofyourself, Sam. (SlRENS WAlLlNG) (TlRES SCREECHlNG) My, my, my. You fellows certainly know how to put on a secret meeting. (HELlCOPTERS WHlRRlNG) You know, the problem is, I don't want to go to the gas chamber. I have headaches. I kill, I don't get them. No, it's not him. lt's the voice. The voice is too high. lt's too young. All right. Thanks for coming down, Bryan. Do you have blackouts? That's okay. l got it. They pulled off the trace. Our Daly City no-show called from a mental institution. Oakland PD's operator is sure the man she talked to had a deeper voice. Calmer. Might have actually been him. CHARLES: "So l shall change my way of collecting slaves. "l shall no longer announce to anyone when l commit my murders. "They shall look like routine robberies, killings of anger "and a few fake accidents, et cetera. "The police shall never catch me "because l have been too clever for them. "l look like the description passed out only when l do my thing. "The rest of the time l look entirely different. "l shall not tell you what my disguise consists ofwhen l kill. "As ofyet l have left no fingerprints behind me, "contrary to what the police say. "l wear transparent fingertips. "All it is is two coats of airplane cement coated on my fingertips. "l enjoy needling the blue pigs. Hey, blue pig, l was in the park. "You were using fire trucks to mask the sound ofyour cruising prowl cars. "Hey, pig, doesn't it rile you up "to have your nose rubbed in your booboos? "lfyou cops think l am going to take on a bus the way l stated l was, "you deserve to have holes in your heads." (CLEARS THROAT) And you need to look at this. (CLEARS THROAT) "Take one bag of ammonium nitrate fertilizer, "one gallon of stove oil, "and dump a few bags of gravel on top..." -Okay. -lt's a bomb. Okay. We gotta call the Army and see if this science experiment could actually work. ARMSTRONG: Another cipher. -When did these arrive? -They arrived this morning. TOSCHl: Are you planning to publish? (WHlSPERlNG) Robert. We should have a drink. (ROCK MUSlC PLAYlNG) Thank you. So, tell me about yourself. -You married? -Divorced. Two kids. What do you do for fun? l love to read. -l enjoy books. -Those are the same things. Why you been going through my trash? l'll come back to that. How did you know he was gonna send another code? l just guessed. -Just guessed. -The first one seemed too easy. All right, this can no longer be ignored. -What is that you're drinking? -lt's an Aqua Velva. You wouldn't make fun of it ifyou tried it. But who actually cracked the code? A married couple who like puzzles. So what's that tell us about the Zodiac? -He's no expert. -Right. lt's just a simple substitution code like the one that we used to do as boy scouts. "A" is one, "B" is two. We weren't all boy scouts, Robert. Well, it's not that hard. You just got to knowwhere to start. ln the first cipher... You actually carry that around with you? -Why? -No reason. What's the most common double consonant in the English language? Consonant? -The double "L." -Double "L." And what's the one word that we know that he'll use in here, at least once? -"Kill." -Right, "kill." So the Hardens start looking for double symbols, which they find here, here, and here. Each with the same two symbols preceding them. So now they've got a repeating four-letterword ending with two symbols that they assume stand for "L." And since they think the whole word is "kill" then... Then you got your "K," you got your "l," and you're on yourway. But how do you go from "A" is one and "B" is two to figuring out this whole code? Well, same way l did. You go to the library. ln this book, the author presents a very simple substitution code in the preface. Eight of the 26 symbols that he suggests are found in this cipher. Yeah, but there are non-letter symbols because there's all these medieval ones. l thought they looked medieval, too. But then l found a code written in the Middle Ages. Guess what it's called? The ZodiacAlphabet. Jesus. What do you want out of this? -What? -What's your angle? This is good business for everyone but you. How do you mean "business"? Hey. Come to bed. l'll be up in a minute. l need to make a phone call. (PHONE RINGING) -Hello? -Bill? There's not many basements in California. "Basement forfuture use." That's right. I'll have Vallejo and Napa check with their city planners. -Get some sleep. -Yeah, sure. MELVIN: "Dear Melvin, this is the Zodiac speaking. "I wish you a happy Christmas. "The one thing I ask of you is this. Please help me. "l cannot reach out for help because this thing in me won't let me." Thank you. "l am finding it extremely difficult to hold it in check "and l am afraid l will lose control again "and take my ninth and possibly tenth victim." Melvin, he's reaching out to you. Absolutely. lnspectors, he sent this letter directly to my residence. lt is a cry for help, intended as a private communiqué. Which is why you contacted the Chronicle. The people have a right to know. Toddy? -When did the letter arrive? -ln the middle of last week. l was away on safari. What did you gentlemen do for Christmas? -You're looking at it. -You must see Africa. Cradle of civilization. Fascinating people. Beautiful. Savage. -Back to the killerwho wrote to you. -Yes. Of course. lt is my belief that he only penned this letter because he couldn't get through to me on the Dunbar show or here. -He tried to contact you here? -Several times. l was out, but he spoke with my housekeeper. Didn't leave a number. He's kind of crafty like that. Do you mind if l speak to her? Not at all. But the real story is the letter. -l'll be back. -Yeah. She's right this way. lnspector Toschi, it is my belief this is a window into this man's soul. Killing is his compulsion. Even though he tries to ignore it, it drives him. lt's in his blood. Could be. Or maybe he just likes the attention. (ROSE GARDEN PLAYlNG ON RADlO) (CAR HORN HONKlNG) l didn't mean to scare you, but your right rearwheel is loose. Really? lfyou like, l could tighten the lugs up for you. lfyou don't mind. Well, you can't be too careful. (BABY COOlNG) (TAPPlNG) -All done. -Thank you. No problem. Have a good night. (BABY CRYlNG) (SHUSHlNG) lt's okay. (RATTLlNG) (CLUNKlNG) Are you okay? Yeah. Yeah, we're fine. Must have been worse than l thought. l can give you a lift to a service station. Okay. (BABY CRYlNG) lt's okay. Come on. l didn't know you had a baby. Oh, is that okay? The more the merrier. You shouldn't smoke. lt's a bad habit. -l think we just passed a filling station. -lt was closed. Do you always go around helping people in the night? When l'm done with them, they don't need much help. (BABY CRYlNG) (SHUSHlNG) lt's okay. Before l kill you, l'm gonna throw your baby out the window. No! Help! Please! No! (SCREAMlNG) She was on the side of the road. She flagged me down. -What happened to her? -She said she jumped from a car. l found her like this. -What is it? -Please, he said... -lt'll be okay. -Tried to kill me. My baby! -Where's her baby? -She didn't have one when l stopped. Where's your baby? Jesus. (BABY CRYlNG) -You hid it? -ln case he came back. TOSCHI: "This is the Zodiac speaking. "By the way, have you cracked the last cipher I sent you? "I'm mildly curious as to how much money you have on my head now. "I hope you do not think I was the one who wiped out that blue meanie "with a bomb at the cop station, "even though I talked about killing children with one." ARMSTRONG: "This is the Zodiac speaking. "I'd like to see some nice Zodiac buttons wandering around town. "Everyone else has these buttons "like peace, black power, and Melvin eats blubber, et cetera. "It would cheer me up considerably "if I saw a lot of people wearing my button. -"Please no nasty ones." -PAUL: "This is the Zodiac speaking." I shot a man sitting in a parked carwith a .38. "Zodiac 12, SFPD zero." "The map coupled with this code will tell you where the bomb is set. "You have until next fall to dig it up." ROBERT: "This is the Zodiac speaking. "I'm rather unhappy because you people "will not wear some nice Zodiac buttons. "So, l now have a little list, starting with the woman and her baby "that l gave a rather interesting ride "for a couple of hours one evening, a few months back, "that ended in my burning her car where l found them." We're really not gonna run anymore of his letters? The new policy. Our brothers in blue want us to hold back and see how he reacts. Four letters in three months, and this is the first mention of Kathleen Johns. That's very weird. That's because he's full of shit. What do you mean? You don't know? Welcome. Please put your stuff down. You're going down five rows and left. Looking for the Modesto Bee from March. l'm going to stand here and attempt not to vomit. -Left. -Left. -What am l looking for? -Kathleen Johns. Also probably you wanna pull the Chron from... You know, never mind. l'll see to that. Okay, look at this letter again. The part about Kathleen Johns. Tell me what facts he gives. -A woman and her baby abducted. -Fact. -The car on fire. -Okay, now, look at the article from the Bee. Seen it yet? Everything in the letter already appeared in the article. And he's done it before. Officer Richard Radetich, shot sitting in his car. Zodiac claimed that he shot someone in their car. Couple days after this article came out. The police already had somebody in custody. Zodiac didn't do it, but took credit for it anyway because he's in it for the press. He even stole his symbol. -What? -Yeah. Shit. lf l show you something, you promise not to tell anyone? -Who would l tell? -Okay. Totally solid point. Okay. That's the only place that word and that symbol ever appeared together before the letters. The guy stole his logo off a watch. How can somebody who's killed 13 people do... He claims he's killed 13 people, but which ones can we actually confirm? There's three in Vallejo, one in Berryessa, the cabbie. That's it. Bobby, you almost look disappointed. Chief's pulling everybody off buses. Business as usual. Something'll shake loose. Not a peep in four months. First he won't shut up and now... Maybe we drove him underground. Maybe he's gone. DISPATCHER: 311 at 582 Haight, cross at Biltmore. There's a male... -Happy birthday, Bill. -Thanks. Does it ever bother you that people call you Shorty? Does it bother you that people call you a retard? -Nobody calls me that. -Right. WOMAN ON TV: As governor, I pledge to use all my influence to make sure that Darlene Ferrin's killer is brought tojustice. I believe some clues were overlooked in the murder of Darlene Ferrin. -I believe her murderwas premeditated. -Who is that? Florence Douglas, mayor ofVallejo. She's running for governor. I believe that the police department either did not have the money, the time or, yes, the inclination... Sayonara, police endorsement. Good work, Flo. Does anyone ever call me names, or... You mean like retard? Yeah. No. Shit. Fuck. Oh, my God. Jesus. Tell me that's not a piece of bloody shirt! Fuck! Holy fucking crap! "l feel it in my bones, you ache to know my name "and so l'll clue you in. "But then, why spoil the game? Happy Halloween." Paul, you did call him a latent homosexual in at least one ofyour articles. Dave. l want a gun. A gun? (GUN FlRlNG) You're in Herb Caen. "Paul Avery's investigation has won him the accolade of a message from the Zodiac warning, 'You are doomed."' "As a result, several crime newsmen are wearing lapel buttons reading, "'l am not Paul Avery."' You should sell these. You could do well. lt's been a windfall, since they published the threat on my life. l got the leads coming out of the woodwork. There's one guy down in Riverside. l'm gonna drive down and see him tonight. -You wanna tag along? -No, l have a date. -Really? -Who is this guy? He wishes to remain anonymous. l wish to remain infamous. So we're going to get along great. Hi. Good evening. Hi. l'm looking for a Melanie. Yes. lt's the young lady sitting by herself. Thank you. You must be Melanie. -Which would make you Robert. -lt would. Glynnis told me lots about you. -And you have wine, great. -l do. Great. How late am l? Just a few minutes, really. l just got here myself. Traffic's bumper to bumper. l was at the gun range. -Glynnis said you were a cartoonist. -Oh, yeah. Well, what're you doing at a gun range? Reading. Get some more... You need some more napkins. So, you work with Glynnis. -For her, actually. -For her? Oh, well... My children are terrified of Glynnis. Me, too. So, the gun range? We're... l'm working on... Do you know the Zodiac? -Yeah. -l'm working with... -Do you knowwho Paul Avery is? -Sounds kind of familiar. He's the writer that the Zodiac threatened. Oh, yeah, l saw that on TV. Well, l work near him and he's going down tonight to track an anonymous tipster down in Riverside. Where is Riverside? lt's near L. A. Oh, wow. l don't think Paul knows that it's that far away. Sounds kind of dangerous. Yeah. How do you mean? Well, you said it was an anonymous tip, right? Yeah. So it could be an ambush. l mean, it could be the Zodiac. Don't you think it's kind of stupid? Yeah, yeah. Well, Paul has a gun. So, do you knowwhat's good here? l've never been here before. The pasta, spaghetti? Are you ready to order yet? Yeah, l'll have the penne vodka. But could you do it in a cream sauce? Of course. Maybe give us another minute? Do you have any change? Oh, wait, no wait, hold on. Nope. That's a penny. Do you have to make a phone call? Yeah, you know, when you were saying that the Zodiac... You know, when you said it was dangerous, l just thought -that it is dangerous, and it's... -Stupid? Stupid. And l just thought that l should call his wife and just see if she's heard from him. l have some change. Okay. Well, she said she'd call when she heard from him. -Good. -Yeah. Melanie, l should really go home and wait for the call. ls this some sleazy plan to get me to go home with you? What? No. l'll get the food to go. Hello! Hi! l'm supposed to meet somebody here. (CLOCK CHlMlNG) (BlRDS CHlRPlNG) Anything? You don't have to stay. Are you kidding? This is the most interesting date l've ever had. (PHONE RlNGlNG) -Paul? -Robert? -Yes. -You sitting down? Yes. You're not gonna believe this. Dave! MAN ON TV: In a bizarre twist, the hunted has become hunter. San Francisco Chronicle reporter and Zodiac target Paul Avery claims to have uncovered new information regarding the only unsolved homicide in Riverside County's history, a 1966 Southern California murder, that Avery now believes was the Zodiac's first victim. What? -He didn't call you about this? -Hang on! The Riverside killer wrote to the press letters that I then took personally to the Office of Questioned Documents. And what did this expert tell you? What I knew in my gut, Ron. The handwriting matches Zodiac's. How'd he get the evidence out of Riverside? He took it to Sherwood without telling us, the son of a bitch. You know how bad this looks? Hey, how do we know that this lead is real? lt's very real. You know how l know? Because l saw it on TV. Excuse me. Dave. Hi. Dave, you know Mel Nicolai. He's working the case for Justice. Good to see you, Mel. All due respect, can someone explain to me why l'm reading about breaks in this case in the Chronicle instead of getting calls from you? We got screwed. Dave, come on. You do get your name in the paper a lot. People talk. l don't ever talk about an open investigation, period. Okay, Ken? Dave? Hey. Hi. Paul Avery. Can l catch a ride with you gents when we get there? Not a good idea, Paul. He's gonna make me take a cab when we're going to the same place. STEWARDESS OVER PA: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for choosing PSA. -Fair enough. Fair enough. -Please take your seats at this time. Remember, smoking is in the last six aisles only. Enjoy yourflight. -Cross? Hi. -Yeah. -lnspector David Toschi, SFPD. -How are you doing? Great. Thanks for having us down today. Not at all. l hear you have some files for us. l'll show you mine. You show me yours. -Frisco huh? -That's right. San Francisco. -Ken Narlow from Napa. -Ken. -Mel Nicolai, Justice. -Mel. CROSS: Here's what we know. Cheri Jo Bates attended Riverside Community College. She studies in the library the night of October 30th, 1966. She leaves with an unidentified male at closing, 9:00 p.m. Her body's found the next morning in a parking lot, stabbed to death. Her car is disabled. Someone cut the coil in the distributor, the battery died. The someone comes back, offers to help. -Like Kathleen Johns. -CROSS: Who? A woman outside of Modesto, might be a Zodiac victim. Might. Might be. l have her comp right here in this file. Okay. A typewritten confession was sent to the Riverside Press Enterprise on November 29th, a month after Bates's murder. They ran it. KEN: "l'm not sick. l am insane. But that will not stop the game. "This letter should be published for all to read." He wants to be published. He calls it a game. l mean, this could be our boy. Six months later, the police, the girl's father, and the paper, they all received these. (SlGHS) Double postage, just like Zodiac. These are what Sherwood Morrill matched to the Zodiac letters? These and the desktop. Don. This was found a couple of months later by a janitor in RCC storage. MEL: Sherwood got a handwriting match offwood? Who etches in their own handwriting? To be honest with you, our letters and your letters, l don't see it. How did Paul Avery get his hands on the exemplars? l gave them to him. We talked on the phone the other day for about an hour. And l told him you were gonna be here. -You told him we were meeting? -Yeah. l also told him we don't think this is Zodiac. Okay, wait a minute. -You don't think this is Zodiac? -We got a guy we like for it. We don't have enough to pin it on him yet, but we're pretty sure it's him. lfyou don't think this is Zodiac, then why give anything to Avery? l'm trying to cooperate. Oh, that's how you cooperate? By giving information to reporters? Look, l don't know about the handwriting, but Sherwood says it's a match, right? So, let's just say that your guy did Cheri Jo. He types the confession. Zodiac reads it in the paper, and he writes a letter taking credit for it. Now, that's something he's done before. Look, now you have everything we have. But, in my opinion, you guys came south for nothing. FUBAR, gentlemen, FUBAR. l don't care what he says. This still could be Z. The problem is the entire state already thinks it is. Well, there's your press agent. Talk to him about it. l come in peace. l don't want any trouble. l really don't want to talk to you right now, Paul. Not now. -Just trying to do myjob. -Oh, really? Well, now l can't do mine. We're already screwed with the amount of tips we got on this thing, and you just freaked out the entire state. l have got Napa, Vallejo, and DOJ looking at me sideways and Riverside's telling me l'm on a snipe hunt! Jesus. Hey, Cheri Jo Bates was a gift. l gave that to you. You and Armstrong neverwould have found her. This may not be Zodiac. Does that matter to you? -What if it is? -Does it matter that Riverside may not be able to make a case against their suspect because ofyou? Tell it to Sherwood. l'm out here, beating the bushes, trying to draw him out. We're in this together. No, we're not in anything together, Paul, because l'm not interested in upping my circulation. Oh, boy. He wrote me. He threatened my life. Hey, Bullitt! Been a year-and-a-half, you gonna catch this fucking guy or not? -Go fuck yourself. -Happily. You should have called me, Paul. Thank you. -Did you see this? -Unfortunately, yes. Here comes every lunatic in California. l'm the Zodiac. And how did you kill your victims? With a gun. No, with a hammer. All l'm authorized to tell you is that he's still under government employment. -And who authorized you to tell me this? -That's all l'm authorized to say. Only a little rat bastard like Andre could have done something like cut off all the victims' hands. Zodiac didn't cut off any of the victims' hands. -Are you sure? -Yes, sir. Travis and l worked here side by side for 10 years. His foot gets crushed in an accident and the killings begin. -Coincidence? -l don't know. You're a cop, man. Do the math. Have you considered the killer might be Paul Avery? Frequently. MAN: He was drinking Coors, getting a load on. Starts talking about hunting people. Like that book. Says how you can put a light at the end of a gun to use as a sight in the dark. -He said that? -Yeah. So l asked him, "Howwould you get away with it?" And he said, "lt would be easy "'cause there'd be no real motive to the thing." Then he said he'd write letters to the police and call himself Zodiac to mess with them. Leigh liked messing with people. -You're positive he said "Zodiac"? -Yeah. l thought it was a stupid name. So l told him. He got up all upset and said, "l don't care what you think. "l've thought about it a long time and that's the name l'm gonna use." Did you feel like he'd been thinking about it a long time? He was raw about losing his job at the school. He talked about shooting out the tires of a school bus and picking off the little darlings. -He actually used those words? -That's what made me remember. Afterwards, l told my wife l didn't wanna see him again. And l haven't since. Other thing is, Leigh's into skin diving. l know he's been up to that lake a bunch of times. Lake Berryessa? Did you ever go with him? Couple times. We went fishing by Putah Creek near there. Tell him when you put it together. About a year ago, in the paper, there was a story about the Zodiac. And it all comes back. l tried to call the local cops. They blew him off. Thought he was a nut. And you're sure the conversation you had about Zodiac took place on January 1st, 1968? lt couldn't have been any later. l started a newjob in L. A. on January 20th. l had to move. -This is my problem. This guy... -ARMSTRONG: Arthur Leigh Allen? This guy, Leigh, just lays out his entire evil plan to a fishing buddy on New Year's Day? l don't know. He's angry, he's been drinking, been thinking about it for a while. l can buy that. So why didn't Cheney contact us sooner? l checked. He did. First recorded contact with the police department aboutAllen was in Pomona. January 10th, 1970. He just got lost in the shuffle. Did Cheney have anything againstAllen? Did Allen screw his wife or anything? We're gonna do a full background check. But l got to tell you, l like this guy. So, let's pull some handwriting samples. Hi. l talked to Sherwood. He got the samples. -What are you having? -BLT. So, the check stubs are a wash. There's not enough handwriting. The application's got more, but it doesn't look like Z's, so he can't rule him in. But he can't rule him out, either. -Well, that's vague. -He needs more samples. Also, our guy is a pervert. When Mel got the application from Valley Springs, they told him that Allen had been fired for touching kids. -Touching? -Polite euphemism. -So what do you want to do? -Make some phone calls. -Are you done with the fries? -Go ahead. ARMSTRONG ON PHONE: Did you and Mr. Cheney have a chance to look at the copies ofthe Zodiac letters we sent you? SANDY: Yeah. Some of this stuff is pretty creepy. -Yeah, we know that. -l mean, creepy like Leigh. He misspells words like that. He thinks it's funny. What about the handwriting? I don't know. Don't you have experts forthat stuff? Our man at Questioned Documents says it's inconclusive. Maybe he did it with his other hand. The letters are a little too neat for someone to have written with the wrong hand. But not for Leigh, right. -What do you mean? -He's ambidextrous. He can write with either hand. Didn't you guys know that? ln everyday life, Allen uses his left hand. Job applications, letters to friends, et cetera. But he writes the Zodiac letters with his right hand producing a different handwriting that he can't be linked to. We got to see this guy, Chief. -Where is he? -ARMSTRONG: Vallejo. He works at Union Oil in Pinole. His brother's up there, too. See them both. Make sure you call Mulanax. lt is his backyard. Oh, right, because that worked so well for us in Riverside. Cooperation, that's us, at all costs. FOREMAN: You can talk to him in here. Coke machine's busted, by the way. l'll go get him for you. So how do you guys wanna do this? Well, Bill talked to the informants. He leads, we follow? lt's okay by me. (BELL RlNGlNG) Mr. Allen, l'm lnspector Bill Armstrong. This is lnspector Dave Toschi and Sergeant Jack Mulanax. We're investigating the Zodiac murders in San Francisco and Vallejo. Please, sit down. ARMSTRONG: The informant notified us that you made certain statements 1 1 months prior to the first Zodiac murder. lf they're true, they're quite incriminating. Do you recall having any such conversation? -No. -Have you ever read or heard anything about the Zodiac? When it was first in the paper. But l didn't follow it after those first reports. -ARMSTRONG: Why not? -Too morbid. l... l told all this to the other officer. -Which other officer? -From Vallejo. Do you remember his name? No, but it was right after the murder at the lake. And what did you tell this officer? l told him that l'd gone to Salt Point that weekend to skin dive. That l was alone but l met a couple there. l have their names at home ifyou want them. That would be great, Arthur. -Leigh. -What? Leigh. Nobody calls me Arthur. Also, that day when l came home, my neighbor saw me. lt was around 4:00. But l forgot to tell the other officer that. -Neighbor's name? -Bill White. He died a week or so afterwards. Heart attack. So l didn't think to call to follow up. The knives l had in my car with the blood on them, that blood came from a chicken that l killed for dinner. -What? -l had knives in my car that weekend. Maybe Bill saw them and called the other officer on me. Well, we'll be checking in on that. Well, let me ask you something else. Were you ever in Southern California at any time in 1966? LElGH: ls this about the Riverside killing? MULANAX: Yes. Well, l guess l was there around that time. l used to go down there a lot. l like the auto races. lnformant says that you're ambidextrous? No, that's untrue. You can't write with both hands? My teachers tried to make me when l was a kid, but l couldn't. l'm left-handed. He also said that you made statements about killing school children. That is... That is horrible. That is... That's a horrible thing to say. So, you weren't angry about being fired from Valley Springs for touching your students? l'm not the Zodiac. And if l was, l certainly wouldn't tell you. That's a nice watch. Thank you. May l see it? (SlGHS) TOSCHl: Where'd you get it? LElGH: lt was a Christmas gift from my mother two years ago. That's very sweet. So, tell me something, Arthur. You don't remember anyone you might have had a conversation with regarding the Zodiac? Maybe Ted Kidder or Phil Tucker at Vallejo Recreation. But l couldn't be positive. l used to work there when... The Most Dangerous Game. What? The Most Dangerous Game. That's why you're here, isn't it? lt was my favorite book in high school. lt's about this man who waits for people to get shipwrecked on this island. Because he was tired of hunting animals, he hunted the people for the challenge. And man is the most dangerous animal of all? That's the whole point of the story. Great book. Or, at least, that's what l told Phil. (BELL RlNGlNG) (MEN CHATTERlNG) May l go? Sure. -Thanks for your time. -l'm willing to help in any way possible. l look forward to the day when police officers are no longer referred to as pigs. Thanks. We'll be in touch. So does anyone think this suspect warrants further investigation? ARMSTRONG: These are copies of some of the Zodiac letters that were sent. We'd like you to take a look at them. You think my brother's the Zodiac. TOSCHl: Well, we're looking at him. Are you going to arrest him? Mrs. Allen, we don't arrest people just because we're interested in them. Well, Leigh's always been troubled. ls it true about the children? Unfortunately. We don't see him much anymore since we found out. What are your feelings about Don Cheney? Don Cheney? My old roommate? -Was he the one who contacted you? -That's confidential. Well, Don's a very reliable guy. lf he were to tell you something, l'd believe it to be true. -This one. -What about it? Here, where he spells "Christmas" with two "S's." We got a Christmas card from Leigh a couple years ago. He spelled it the exact same way. Christ-mass. -Would you still have that? -l can look for it. Thank you. That'd be great. ls there anything else we can do to help? TOSCHI: The brother said he would search Leigh's apartment next time he went out of town. -That gets you around a warrant. -For the time being. lfwe do find something, Mulanax will go to the DA in Vallejo, and we could search the place properly. Now l got a chance to talk to the cop who interviewed Leigh Allen two days after the Berryessa murders. Doesn't remember how he got onto him, but didn't think he looked like a killer so he didn't like him for Z. -But you do? -l wish l could've taken the guy in there. Take it slow, Dave. Try and find more stuff for Sherwood. A match'll get us farther on the warrants. -Avery's on two. -Tell him to screw. You want me to communicate that verbatim or can l spice it up a little? (KNOCKlNG) Christ, kid. Yeah. -Paul, l've been thinking... -Oh, God save us all. The letter to Melvin Belli was sent exactly one year after the Lake Herman Road murder. And the one to Cheri Jo Bates' father was sent exactly six months after her death. -She was killed a day before Halloween. -Yeah. And you received a Halloween card... You know, these are all fascinating pieces of news, Robert, it's a bit early in the day. Paul, it's 1 1 :00 and we missed Editorial. -l'm sorry. l didn't mean to wake you up. -No, no, no. -l just thought that... -No, no, no. This suspect is not your Zodiac. This sample matches the canceled checks and the application? Perfectly. So we've just retested the left hand. l mean, we know he's ambidextrous. ln 38 years, l've never seen anyone that ambidextrous. Both hands would have commonalities. l'm sorry. Just not gonna work. (PHONE RINGING) -TOSCHI: Homicide, Toschi. -Dave, it's Jack Mulanax. (WHlSPERlNG) Hey. Mulanax. Yeah. We struck out with thejudge. He won't sign off on a warrant for Allen's house. -Why not? -Said it wasn't enough. Now, unless we bring him a handwriting match or some evidence that... How are we gonna get evidence ifwe can't toss the house? I don't know. -l truly am sorry. -No, no. Thank you, Jack. What do you wanna do? Don't knowwhat l can do without Vallejo. We need Allen's right hand. We can't get it without a warrant. Are there other guys you should be looking at? (SCOFFS) Only, what? Twenty-three hundred? Okay, then. Paul, you wrote the Justice Department asking to be put in charge of the Zodiac investigation? l merely suggested... On our letterhead? ...that those with intimate knowledge of the case create an information clearinghouse to promote an exchange and free flow of ideas. -And that you run it. -Well, who better than me? The marked man. Paul, ifyou want to work here, l need three things. One, stop boozing. Two, stop doing whatever else it is you're doing. And three, cut this nonsense out. Sweetest of Templetons, if at any time you feel my excellent work is no longer in step with this trashy provincial rag, l'll more than happily... More than happily decamp for greener pastures. Paul, l mean it! (DOOR BANGS SHUT) -Paul? -Yep. -What was that? -An editorial tête-à-tête. -Wanna grab a drink? -lt's 10:00 in the morning. Late breakfast? -Early lunch, or... -Paul. Are you okay? No. Thank you for asking. Shorty! Let's go out for one. Paul, where are you going? CATHERINE: So, you moved off my brother-in-law? We couldn't get a warrant. Last yearwe arranged for Leigh to get help from a social worker. He only went twice. We saw him recently for the first time in nine months. My mother-in-law brought him by to see the new baby. After he left, l went to see that social worker. He couldn't talk about a former patient, so l just asked him straight out if he thought Leigh was capable of killing people. -Because of patient confidentiality... -The man said yes. Why hadn't you seen him in nine months? He's going to school in Santa Rosa. -Santa Rosa? Where is he living? -ln his trailer. -ln Santa Rosa? -Sonoma County. We wouldn't have to go through the Vallejo DA. lt's been 1 1 months since you talked to this guy, and now you wanna search his trailer? lfwe find something, great. lf not, we get his prints and handwriting samples from both hands. l thought Sherwood shut you down. What if l can get a second opinion? l don't wanna step on Sherwood's toes. He trained me at this. Terry, all l need to know is if the suspect is ambidextrous. Could he possibly have written those letters with his other hand? Between you and me? Because there are differing schools of thought on this. Get the samples of his other hand. lf he's the Zodiac, you'll get a match. ARMSTRONG: That's the current thinking, according to Terry Pascoe. Meanwhile, l spoke to a psychologist who'd be willing to testify that someone who undergoes a personality change like Zodiac would manifest it physically, altering his handwriting. Which is why Sherwood couldn't get a match from Allen's samples. We got Terry Pascoe, this psychology guy, coupled with Cheney... lt could be enough for a warrant. Get Cheney on the record. "And that he would call himself Zodiac." Yes. And you're willing to swear to this, under oath, in Superior Court? Without any hesitation. Thank you very much, Mr. Cheney. Thank you very much for your time. Thank you. Suspect is Arthur Leigh Allen. Lives in Sunset Trailer Court in Santa Rosa, California. Physical description. Allen is similar in height, weight and build to a man seen at Lake Berryessa on the day of the stabbings. JOHN: I understand he doesn't look much like the San Francisco composite. True. Height and weight are sketchy, but lumbering Caucasian with a crew cut is right on. We never had much confidence in the composite from the kids. The patrolman who saw Zodiac that night said he didn't look much like the sketch. Military boot prints. Allen was in the Navy. Wears a size 10-and-a-half. Same size as the prints found at Berryessa. What about gun? Cheney says Allen owns several firearms. We'll list them in the warrant. -And the ciphers. -Could be code training in the Navy, and people have seen Allen with ciphers in the past. Really? Who? That would be his sister-in-law and a man named Phil Tucker that he worked with at a public pool in Vallejo. And Phil Tucker told us about a conversation that he had with Allen about how to attach a flashlight to the barrel of a gun. That gives us two sources on the ciphers and two on the flashlight. What about his threats on children? Suspect worked for elementary schools and was fired for molestation in March, April '68. -Could give him motive. -At the very least, it's home turf. He'd have knowledge of bus routes, which the two major threats centered around. What about the bomb? Allen works as a chemist. Take him through the geography. Vallejo murders. Allen lives in Vallejo with his mother in her basement. Berryessa murder. On the day that the two kids were stabbed his neighbor saw bloody knives in his truck which he claimed were used to kill a chicken. Does he have any alibis? He claimed he did, but he's been unable to produce the names of the couple he supposedly met on the day of Berryessa. The bottom line is thatAllen can't alibi up on anything. Riverside, Vallejo, the lake or us. -You want to tell me about the name? -What name? Zodiac. Allen wears a watch that bears both the word and crosshair symbol. And he mentioned Zodiac to Cheney a year and a half before it appeared in any letter. -John... -That's pretty good, guys. -We think so, too. -Let's take it to ajudge. (DOG BARKlNG) Mr. Allen? This is the Santa Rosa Police Department. We have a warrant to search your residence. (DOG BARKlNG) (CHlRPlNG) Hello? l'll check with the neighbors. Close the door. Close the door, there's rodents running around. Neighbor said he tore out of here about a half-hour ago. -You think somebody tipped him? -We're not leaving till he comes back. l'll check the back. (BOTTLES CLATTERlNG) Jesus. -What? -Squirrels. Piece ofwork, this guy. (TOSCHl EXCLAlMS) Not one, but two blue windbreakers. -Like the Stine scene? -We'll have those checked for blood. And a pair of black gloves. Men's seven, just like the ones we found in the cab. Well, he's got the same size shoes and gloves as Z. Probablyjust a coincidence. Dave, l got a gun. Check that. Two guns. They're both .22s. One automatic, one revolver. TOSCHl: Well, that's interesting. Because he happens to have an M-1 rifle here in the closet. For little darlings bouncing off buses. (VEHlCLE APPROACHlNG) Someone's here. Hello, Arthur. Remember us? (TELEPHONES RlNGlNG) (TYPEWRlTERS CLACKlNG) No. On the handwriting? Ballistics, no match. Prints, no match. Writing, no match. On both hands, right? Because we got handwriting from both his hands. And neither hand matches. Forget Sherwood. Let's get another opinion. Fellas, he's not your guy. (CLATTERlNG) Damn it. Hey. What do you want? Time off? A hug? Do you knowwhat the worst part of this is? l can't tell if l wanted it to be Allen so bad because l actually thought it was him, or l just want all this to be over. lt's because you thought it was him. And l did, too. (SlGHS) You knowwhat? Take some time off. Spend some time with yourwife and the kids. Go to Candlestick. See a movie. MAYOR IN FILM: "To the city of San Francisco, "I will enjoy killing one person every day "until you pay me $100,000. "If you agree, say so tomorrow morning "in the personal column San Francisco Chronicle, "and I will set up meeting.

Where the hell does he expect me to find $100,000? MAN: You're not thinking of paying him, are you, Mr. Mayor? The city of San Francisco does not pay criminals not to commit a crime. (PEOPLE CHATTERlNG) (CLEARlNG THROAT) The killer gets shot in the chest. That's how it ends. Do l know you? l'm Robert Graysmith. l work at the Chronicle with Paul Avery. Dave Toschi. Nice to meet you. Dave! That Harry Callahan did a hell of a job with your case. Yeah. No need for due process, right? -What do you do at the Chronicle? -l'm a cartoonist. That's nice.

Oh, l'm sure he was. l mean, it's a honor to leave the Chronicle and go work for the Sacramento Bee. Dare to dream, right, Robert? -Nice to meet you. -Nice to meet you, too. l'm just right down there at the Art department -ifyou need anything, Duffy. -Yeah. TOSCHl: You sure you don't want the car, Bill? ARMSTRONG: lt's your turn. You could just drop me off at my place and take the car. You should keep the car. Yeah? l'm not coming in tomorrow. Why? What's up? l'm done. l put in for a transfer. (CLEARS THROAT) Where? Looking at Fraud. l can't be on call anymore. l wanna see these kids grow up. Hey, good for you, Bill. -You'll be okay. -Yeah. l'll be fine. Hey, l'm not leaving you holding the bag on anything, am l? No. Okay. Hey, you knowwhat? Maybe you'll have a chance to try your Japanese food, the raw stuff. Yeah. (ENGlNE STARTS) l'm not Paul Avery. The boys need to be tucked in, please, and the baby needs changing. -l'll flip you for it. -You wish. Nobody has more Zodiac crap than you do. (SEAGULLS CAWlNG) -Are you kidding me? -Hi, Paul. Permission to come aboard. lt's right there. Anyway, you got shoes on. This is perfect right here. -That's the one. -Okay. (VlDEO GAME BEEPlNG) -See that? Mesmerizing. -Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. My own kids would kill me for one of those. (BOTH CHUCKLlNG) -How are you? -Fantastic. l mean, admittedly, the Bee ain't exactly the Chron, but fuck it, right? Do you want a drink? l don't have anything blue, but l got... Don't worry about that. Don't worry about it. lt's no bother at all. Nobody comes by from the old days. Cheers. To your health and mine. Mostly mine. So, what's new? -l've been thinking. -Yeah. Somebody should write a book. Somebody should write a fucking book, that's for sure. -About what? -About Zodiac. lt's not new. l've been thinking that ifyou put all the information together, maybe you could jog something loose. And then l was thinking that nobody knows the case better than you. Yeah. That's true. You know all the players, and you have all the files. Lost them. You lost them? Or l tossed them. l don't know. l moved onto a boat. You know that we work in the daily business, right? As in, today. What do you think we were doing back then? Do you know that more people die in the East Bay commute every three months than that idiot ever killed? He offed a few citizens, he wrote a few letters, and he faded into a footnote. (SlGHS) Not that l haven't been sitting here idly waiting for you to drop by and reinvigorate my sense of purpose. lt was four years ago. Let it fucking go. You're wrong. lt was important. Then, what did you ever do about it? lf it was so fucking important, what did you ever do? You hovered over my desk, you stole from wastebaskets. Am l being unkind? Oh, that's right, l forgot. You went to the library. l'm sorry l bothered you. -Hey, hi. -Hi. -Where you been? -The library. (DOOR CLOSES) (ENGlNE STARTS) Thank you! (TYPEWRlTER CLACKlNG) -lnspector Toschi? -Yeah? One moment, please. -Hi. -Hi. We met at the movies once. lt must have been magical. l'm Robert Graysmith. l work at the Chronicle. l was wondering if l could buy you lunch. Sure, why not? So, you're a friend of Paul Avery's? He's actually the reason l'm here. l wanted to ask you about Zodiac. Well, l appreciate the interest, but we don't discuss open cases. Oh, well, what's going on with it, day to day? We're actively pursuing all leads. And you're the only one on it, right? Mr. Graysmith, Zodiac hasn't written in three years. You know how many murders we've had in San Francisco since then? -No. -Over 200. That's a lot of dead people and grieving families that need our help. So, nobody cares. Excuse me? l care. Okay. Can l show you something? l've been doing research on the first cipher. Everything an amateur would need to create it can be found in these books. Now, l started thinking that ifyou can track these books, then maybe you can track the man. So, l remember you thought that Zodiac was military, so l went to every base library and l got a list of every person who's ever checked out these books and that's when l found this. -Missing. -lt means they were stolen. So, almost every book on ciphers was stolen from the Presidio Library? And the Oakland Army Terminal Library. Somebody didn't want a record of ever having checked out these books. Who are you again? l just wanna help. l can't allow you to help. l can't discuss the case with you. l can't give you information, and l certainly couldn't tell you to go see Ken Narlow in Napa. N-A-R-L-O-W. l'm sorry, Mr. Graysmith, but we don't cooperate with writers. Well, l'm not a writer, l'm a cartoonist. -And Dave Toschi sent you? -Yes. -Why? -Maybe he... Maybe he thought that l could do some good. -What are you, some kind of boy scout? -Eagle Scout, actually, first class. Well, ifyou wanna do this, don't let me stop you. Better start with Vallejo, Jack Mulanax. l understand what you're trying to do. But this is an open police investigation. l'm a friend of Dave Toschi's. And he said that you might be able to help. l mean, the case is dead. Zodiac's long gone. He's yesterday's news, right? That's what they say. So, what's the harm? MULANAX: No pens, no paper. Anything that you see that's relevant, you got to remember in your head. Okay. Okay, here we go. -Which one? -All of them. And there's more in the next room. They're all marked with these numbers. 243-146. You don't smoke, do you? Once. ln high school. What's this? Thank you. (READlNG) MIKE: Man, you really creeped us out. ROBERT: "Nine millimeter. "Said nothing and began firing." (READlNG) "Most Dangerous Game. "Do not eliminate this suspect because of handwriting. "Not because of handwriting. "Darlene's sister, Linda. "lt was all just deep breathing. George. "lt was a strange man. George. Strange man." Thank you so much. Oh, briefcase. Oh, thanks. -Hey, Jack. -Hey, Bawart. -Who's that? -That's Graysmith. Some cartoonist. Thinks he's gonna solve the Zodiac. Well, good for him. (MAN CHATTERING ON TV) -Thank you for meeting me, lnspector. -No. We're not meeting, Robert. We're just two guys who happen to be sitting on the same bench at the same time. l've got five minutes. l've got to get back to the Hall. Okay. As far as you know, did anyone ever get in touch with Mike Mageau during your investigation -and show him suspect photos? -Why? Well, he's the only surviving victim who ever saw Zodiac without a mask. No, l mean, why are you asking me? Mageau and Darlene, that's Vallejo's case. Paul Stine is mine. You've got four minutes now. Darlene Ferrin was being followed. Now, l know Mulanax says that they already found this guy, a George Waters? But he also said that she had a lot of admirers who would come to the restaurant where she worked. -She was popular. -Very. Yeah. So... She and her husband, they move into their new house, and one night they throw this painting party. And what's a painting party? lt's a party where people come and help you paint. Sounds like a terrible party. Well, supposedly, somebody who's not Waters shows up. And Darlene is terrified of him. So you think that Darlene knew Zodiac? And if Zodiac knew Darlene, then maybe Mageau knows Zodiac. Maybe. But Mageau's gone. So ifyou wanna connect Darlene to Zodiac, you're gonna have to find anotherway. l have anotherway. Phone calls the night of Darlene's murder. -Yeah, Zodiac called the police. -No, Dave, there were four other calls. There were two to Darlene's house, one to Darlene's brother-in-law, and one to Darlene's father-in-law. Just heavy breathing. They started around 1 :30 a.m., and this was before anyone in the family knew that Darlene had been shot. -This was in the Vallejo files? -Yeah. God damn it. lt's got to be more than just a coincidence, right? l mean, somebody doesn'tjust randomly prank phone call a victim's entire family 90 minutes after they were shot. So, either Zodiac shoots a random couple, then he recognizes Darlene... Or Darlene was shot on purpose. Eitherway, Zodiac had to have known Darlene. That's good, Robert. So, l can't find Mageau, so maybe l can find Darlene's sister. And maybe she can tell me who this mystery man is. Try that. l've got to go. She's very cute. You know, it's interesting that you should mention Zodiac calling people at home. He did that in San Francisco once. What? Who did he call? l can't tell you. That's privileged information. But maybe Melvin Belli could. Melvin Belli. How do l get to Melvin Belli? -He should be along soon. -Oh, that's all right. l've really... l've only been waiting two hours, so... He's usually not this late. Oh, cookies. Thank you. These look great. -You are here on business? -l'm writing a book about the Zodiac. l remember that. l spoke to him. -You mean to Mr. Belli about the case? -No, to the Zodiac when he called. He said he had to kill because it was his birthday. He said it... Wait. He said it was his birthday? Yes. You want something to drink? -(STUTTERlNG) When was this? -Oh, so many years ago. Mr. Belli was away for Christmas. Gone for a week. The Zodiac called, wanting to talk to him. l said, "He is not here." He said, "l have to kill. Today is my birthday." And then he hangs up. Then the letter arrived. So, the call came before the letter of December 20th. Mr. Belli was gone for a week? He came back on Christmas. Not a good day to work. So, he left on the 18th. ls that helpful? She said it was his birthday. TOSCHI: Well, you'd have to confirm that, now wouldn't you? How? Well, I never spoke to her, but maybe my partner did. -How do l get a hold of him? -You don't. Bill wanted out ofthis. As far as I'm concerned, he should stay out. (STAMMERlNG) How do l confirm it? Well, if my partner did talk to someone from Justice, then they would've had to put that in a report. That's standard procedure. -Okay. -Mel Nicolai. -Thank you. -Goodbye. l just need to confirm a date. -Mr. Graysmith... -l've narrowed it down between the 18th and the 20th of December, and l just need... Okay, l'll play. Let's say this phone call did take place. Let's say it really was Zodiac. Why would he volunteer the day he was born? Plus, nobody died on December 18th, just like nobody died over the weekend when he was gonna kill a dozen people, orwhen he was gonna shoot school kids or blow up buses. He's a liar, Mr. Graysmith. What if he made a mistake? What if he wasn't lying? What if it was him on the phone? He didn't expect to pick it up, a nice person to pick up. What if? What if? What if? Look, off the record, Bill Armstrong checked this out. We took this very seriously. None of the suspects had the same birthday as this phantom caller. (MUTTERlNG) Bill Armstrong. Can l give you a piece of advice? You're looking in the wrong place. Handwriting, fingerprints, that's what this whole thing's about. Stick to the evidence. Hi. -Hey. Howwas your day? -Long. Who's Sherwood Morrill? He's a handwriting expert in Sacramento. He called. He said he can meet you tomorrow morning at 7:00. Oh, great. -So you're taking offwork? -Just an hour. Sacramento's two hours away. -Really? -Yes. What's this? Oh, that's that article. "Robert Graysmith has quietly been shopping his book about the Zodiac." Yeah. lt talks all about you researching Zodiac. Well, that's what the article's about. l'm not so sure that's something we want people to know about. Why? Are you embarrassed? Robert, what's the one thing we know about Zodiac? He reads the Chronicle. Yeah, but he's never gonna read Herb Caen. (TELEPHONE RlNGlNG) -Hello. -MAN: Mr. Graysmith? The Robert Graysmith mentioned in the papertoday? -Yeah? -I can tell you who the Zodiac is. Who is this? The Zodiac Killer is obsessed with movies. He recorded his murders on film. I tried to tell the police, but they wouldn't follow through on it. There's a man you need to find. His name is Bob Vaughn. -Pen, pen. -V-A-U-G-H-N. He's a friend ofthe Zodiac's. Mr. Vaughn does not know his friend is a killer, and he is storing some film canisters for him. In these canisters is the evidence. Okay, yeah, friend? Who is this friend? You have quite enough to get started. Oh, please. The Zodiac's name is Rick Marshall. (PHONE HANGS UP) Your toast is burning. We choose at some point in our lives how to physically construct each letter. Once we lock that into our brains, our handwriting may change over the years, but the moves themselves remain unaltered. -Understand? -Yes. Except Zodiac's doesn't. Specifically with his "K." ln his first letters, he executed the "K" with two strokes. Later letters, he did them with three. -Why? -We don't know. Excuse me, l've got to spray this. How many suspects were cleared through handwriting? All of them. Also the print in the cab. No match was ever found. ls there any way that someone could beat a handwriting test? No. Whoever the Zodiac is, he's not someone l cleared. About a month ago, a man showed up on my doorstep very distraught. His name was Wallace Penny. He said he knewwho the Zodiac was. Gave me a name. Rick. Rick somebody. -Rick Marshall? -Yeah. l think that the man who you talked to called me, too. After he left, then l checked my files. l never cleared a Rick Marshall. (TELEPHONE RlNGlNG) Hello? (HEAVY BREATHING) Hello? Who is this? (HEAVY BREATHING) (PHONE HANGS UP) lt's the wrong number. Does the name Rick Marshall mean anything to you? What are you after? What do you got? Hypothetically, you just named my favorite suspect in the whole case. This is off the record. Couple years back, l was trying to get Marshall's prints. l handed him a photo. He looks at it. He's about to give it back and he stops and he says, "My goodness, l got fingerprints all over this." And he wipes them off. Why didn't you test him for handwriting? Because when they finally did run his prints, they cleared him against the one in Stine's cab. -So, then, it's not him. -Maybe yes, maybe no. No. What do you mean? Zodiac left gloves behind at the scene. lf he had the foresight to bring gloves with him, how the hell's he gonna accidentally leave a print behind? But it was in the victim's blood. Could have been one of the bystanders, or a cop just reaches out, boom, false print. Yeah, but that print disqualified 2,500 suspects. Which is why we also used handwriting. But not for Rick Marshall. SFPD saw a handwritten sign in the window of his house. Decided it looked nothing like the Z letters, so theyjust moved on. How do they know that Rick Marshall wrote the sign? My thoughts exactly. Rick Marshall was a Navy man. He received code training. He was also a projectionist at a silent film theater. Well, then, how do l get copies of Rick Marshall's handwriting? Three ways. One, get a warrant, which you can't. Two, get him to volunteer, which he won't. Yeah, and three? Get creative. SHERWOOD: I don't know what to tell you. You get it, I'll analyze it. Beyond that, you're on your own. (STAMMERlNG) Okay, what about the guy who came to see you, the one who called me? You mean Wallace Penny? Yeah. Did he leave a number? (TELEPHONE RINGING) -MAN: Hello? -Hi, this is Robert Graysmith. How did you find me? l need a sample of Rick Marshall's handwriting. I told you. Vaughn is who... Mr. Penny, if Rick Marshall is the Zodiac, l need a sample of his handwriting to confirm it. Can you help me or not? (SIGHING) Rick used to draw movie posters forthe theater Vaughn worked at. -I'll send one down. -Thank you. -l'll need to see more samples. -Yeah, but is it... lt's as close as l've ever seen. We have to tread lightly here. We're talking about implicating this man as the Zodiac. l can get more. l'll just find Vaughn and l'll track down Linda. l mean, Linda is Darlene's sister. l've been to the DMV, and l talked to her parents, but still, nobody knows where to find her. Mr. Graysmith, most of the writing matches the exemplar. ln a way, though, it's the part that doesn't match that scares me the most. -What do you mean? -Well, on the poster, the one letter that absolutely, positively does not match is the letter "K." You wouldn't happen to have any animal crackers in there, would you? WOMAN ON DISPATCH: Unit Five. Toschi needs to call in on a landline. (PHONE BEEPING) -WOMAN: Dispatch. -Hey. Dave Toschi. I'll connect you. -LEE: Dave? -Yeah. What's up? Jennings here from the Chronicle. lt came in this morning and you need to see it right now. See what? The new Zodiac letter. And it mentions you. Okay, okay. Shit. All right, come on. Hall of Justice! Now! Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on! (SlREN WAlLlNG) Dave! Do you have it with you? "This is the Zodiac speaking. l'm back with you. "Tell Herb Caen l am here, l have always been here. "That city pig Toschi is good, but l am smarter and better. "He will get tired, then leave me alone. "l'm waiting for a good movie about me. Who will play me? "l'm now in control of all things." These guys are from lnternal Affairs. We need to talk. NEWSCASTER: Good evening. Ourtop story tonight, the San Francisco Police Department has confirmed that the man who calls himselfthe Zodiac and terrorized the Bay Area has broken his silence of 51 months. In a letter claiming, "I am back with you," the Zodiac makes no overt threats against the citizenry, and muses that his life and times would make the best movie script yet. These carrots are perfect. The terse 66 word message also manages... Just go. ...to mention San Francisco Chronicle columnist Herb Caen and the Department's own David Toschi by name. -May l be excused? -Are they targets? Fine, but you have to come back and finish at least half ofwhat's on that plate. More team coverage on the cipher slayer's return... MELANlE: Okay? DAVlD: Okay. ...begins as Alan Freeman has more. Thank you, Eric. San Francisco Chronicle columnist Armistead Maupin says that he thinks not only is this new letter a forgery, but it was written by the very man trusted to hunt down this killer, David Toschi. Maupin, a very well-respected author, has gone on record saying that he believes Toschi wrote the letter to drum up publicity for himself. Maupin used David as a character in his column. (JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING) David got a kick out of it and so he wrote a couple of anonymous letters asking for the character to be brought back. It was like writing fan mail to himself. That's all. But David did not write that letter. No, l'm sure that he didn't. And l'm sure that this will all blow over. Blow over? They kicked him out of Homicide. They made him give his handwriting like some common criminal. -May l talk to him? -No. Okay, can you just ask him if he ever investigated a man named Rick Marshall? ls that all you can think about? Mr. Graysmith, Maupin works at your paper. We trust... This girl, she wants music lessons? Dave! Dave! l'll catch up to you. You stop calling my house. Do you understand me? l just need your help to find Linda. -Jesus. -Look, two seconds. Look, we've been running handwriting samples. -(STUTTERlNG) Who's we? -Sherwood and l. Sherwood? Sherwood who was fired from Questioned Documents? Sherwood who drinks like Paul Avery now? -He retired. -ls that what he told you? -What, are you saying he's wrong? -l'm saying stop calling my house. -We ran them on Rick Marshall. -No, Robert. No, l know you don't think it's him. l mean, no, l am not having this conversation. But l think that Marshall knew Darlene, and l can't talk to Mageau or Linda, so l'm gonna talk to Bob Vaughn. -Robert. Robert, stop it! -What? Okay, the Rick Marshalls of this world will suck you dry. They're blind alleys. But he said he wasn't gonna announce his murders anymore, Dave. He was just gonna do them. Do you knowwhat the chances of us arresting someone are now? Too much time has gone by, okay? Too much of the evidence is lost. People get old, Robert. They forget. Now, l have been a cop for 25 years. Murder police for 12. -What do you do for a living? -You knowwhat l do for a living. -You're a cartoonist. -So what are you saying? l am saying Zodiac was myjob. lt is not yours. -He's still out there, Dave. -No, Robert. l am through with this. l am through with you. What about September 26, 1970? -DAVlD: Okay, which one was that? -The Lake Tahoe nurse goes missing. One day before the vernal equinox. -Dad? -Yeah. Mark that. Got another one. June 19th, 1971 . That's got to be near the summer solstice. Oh, guys. Don't tell Mom about our special project, okay? How come you and Mom don't sleep in the same bed anymore? (TELEPHONE RlNGlNG) Hello. Mr. Graysmith, it's Ken Narlow from Napa. Oh, Captain Narlow. Thank you for calling me back. Yeah. How can I help? (STUTTERlNG) l called you because we've been cross-referencing lunar cycles with the Zodiac's timeline. More often than not, each cycle since '69 corresponds with an attack orwith one of the letters, or an unsolved homicide. -Who's working with you on this? -Some colleagues. Dad? -Ken, can you hold on one second? -Dad? -(WHlSPERlNG) What is it? -What's this? NEWSCASTER:In the decade since the Zodiac's last cipherwas received, every federal agency has taken a crack at decoding it. But today, where those agencies had failed, a cartoonist has succeeded. How did you do it? Oh, just a lot of books from the library, and I love puzzles, so I just... (lNHALES) Yeah. The fucking library. I believe that you can accomplish anything that you put your mind... (COUGHlNG) ROBERT: That's a "J"? Okay. Honor Camp? Thank you so much. Hey, we found Linda. She's in jail. lsn't that great? Why'd you do it? Because she'll be able to identify Rick... -What are you talking about? -You went on TV. You put yourself out there for him to see. Oh, hon, you're being paranoid. Then who's been calling our house in the middle of the night at least once a week? Nobody. What's it gonna take for you to be done with this? l can't talk about this now. l have to go see Bob Vaughn. Well, that's too bad, because we're gonna talk about this. And when is it gonna be finished? When you catch him? When you arrest him? -Be serious. -l am serious. l need to knowwho he is. l need to stand there, l need to look him in the eye and l need to know that it's him. ls that more important than your family's safety? Of course not. Why? Why do you need to do this? Why? Because nobody else will. That's not good enough. Are you done? Can l go? (RAlN PATTERlNG) (CAR HORN HONKlNG) -Mr. Vaughn? -Mr. Graysmith? -Yes. -Hi. You needed to speak to me? Yes. There's a coffee shop right on the corner. -Why don't we just go to my home? -Oh, l don't wanna put you out. lt's no trouble at all. -Where are you parked? -Just right there. -You can follow me. -Oh. Okay. Watch your step. Come in. -Very nice house. -Oh, thank you. lt's very rustic. -Can l take yourjacket? -No, thank you, l'm fine. Okay. This way, please. -Have a seat. -Thank you. -How about some tea? -Oh, no, l'm all right. -You sure? -Yes. l wanted to ask you about a film that the Avenue may have played while you were the organist there. The Most Dangerous Game? Oh, it's a classic. RKO. 1932. Fay Wray, Joel McCrea, Leslie Banks. We've run that picture many times. ln '68, '69? l'd have to check my records. Why? Do you remember the Zodiac? This is about Rick Marshall, isn't it? -He was a projectionist there, right? -For a time, yes. But l have no occasion to correspond with him these days. Okay. Well, there is a connection between one of the Zodiac attacks and that film. You mean the symbol? Hold on. The Zodiac symbol on film. lt's on the countdown. lt's trimmed off each reel before it's shown, but it always arrives with it. Right there. The first time l saw it in the papers, l thought about that. We got a tip that Rick left a film canister here that he told you never to open. A tip about a mysterious film canister? ls it true? Yes. -Did you open it? -No. -May l see it? -Rick took it back in 1972. This tip is how you got it in your head that Rick is the Zodiac? That and the poster. The poster? The poster that Rick drew. The handwriting is the closest that we have ever come to a match. -Rick didn't draw any posters. -No, he drew this one. Mr. Graysmith, l do the posters myself. That's my handwriting. l won't take any more ofyour time. Why don't l just go and find out when we played that film? Oh, that's all right. lt's not a problem. They're just down in the basement. Not many people have basements in California. l do. You coming, Mr. Graysmith? The original studio one-sheets, l always kept for myself. The cheapo knock-offs like you brought today l end up tossing into the back alley. (MUMBLlNG) '69. (FLOORBOARDS CREAKlNG) You live alone? Most Dangerous Game ran in May '69. So, that would be about nine weeks before the first Zodiac letter, correct? Yeah. Do you think he saw the film in our theater and was inspired? (WATER RUNNlNG) (CREAKlNG) Are you sure there's nobody else in the house? Would you like to go upstairs and check? No. Thank you. Thanks for everything. You're welcome. (KETTLE WHlSTLlNG) (BREATHlNG HEAVlLY) (RATTLlNG) lt's locked. Thank you. Good night, Mr. Graysmith! Two killers. Got to be two killers. One has the... Guys? (EXCLAlMS) You've got five minutes. Linda? Hi, l'm Robert. Did you get my note? -What's this about? -Zodiac. Figures. -You got the look. -What look? l didn't mean anything. Tell me about this painting party. l told the cops about that so long ago. Darlene always had a lot of boys around, even though she was married. And this one guy was weird, though. He used to bring her presents from Tijuana and... l don't knowwhy she was friends with him. She once told me he'd killed somebody. Really? Yeah, l think maybe when he was in the service. -Navy? -l think so. Was he into movies? Was he a movie buff? l can tell you that he was not into people. The party Darlene threw, people were supposed to just show up and drink beer, help paint. But this guy showed up in a suit, and just sat in a chair all by himself all night long. Didn't talk to anyone. And Darlene told me to stay away from him. She was scared of him. (THUNDER RUMBLlNG) And a couple ofweeks later, she was dead. l'm sorry. Do you remember his name? l mean, it was short, like a nickname, like Stan. -Rick? -No, l don't think so. -Are you sure? -Yeah. How can you be sure? lt was a long time ago. Think hard. l am thinking hard. lt was Rick. No, it wasn't. -lt was Rick. lt was Rick Marshall. -No. Just say it! lt wasn't Rick. lt was Leigh. -Leigh? -Yeah, Leigh. Sounds right. Officer! l need you to let me in. -ls this an emergency? -No, l just need to see one file. No, you need to come back tomorrow morning. -One file, just for one second. -8:00 a.m., when we're open. Sergeant! Sergeant Mulanax! Sergeant, l just need to see one file! Just give me five minutes. l know exactly where it is. Please! l shouldn't be talking to you. -You got five minutes. -Okay. Here. Here. Linda states that some of Darlene's closest friends are Leigh, who used to bring Darlene presents from Tijuana. -So what? -He knew her. Linda said Leigh. This is Leigh. No. That's just one name in a file that contains hundreds. lt's nothing. -Dave Toschi... -Agrees with me. Our investigation into this subject is over. l'm sorry. (TELEPHONE RlNGlNG) Hello. (HEAVY BREATHING) Who's there? -You didn't return my calls. -Oh, l've been kind of busy. Yeah. l can see that. How's the book coming? l tried to send you these. l called the Chron. Well, l'm not a cartoonist anymore, so... l heard. When's the last time you ate something? Nothing makes sense anymore. -Did it ever? -Yeah, it did. Robert, it was just the date that didn't end. You don't mean that. A little. The kids miss you. -l can't have them see me like this. -Neither can l. So, do whatever you have to, but finish this. (THUNDER RUMBLlNG) (KNOCKlNG ON DOOR) ROBERT: Dave! Dave! lt's Robert! (KNOCKlNG CONTlNUES) -Dave! -ls he actually here? l'm gonna kill him. l'm calling SFPD. Where's my gun? (KNOCKlNG CONTlNUES) Dave! Robert! Go away! Dave! He made a mistake! -Get away from the window. -l'll meet you around front. No, you won't. -You have to hear this! -No, l don't, Robert! The birthday was the one time that he was weak! The one time that he gave something away! -Robert, l am calling the police. -lt's Arthur Leigh Allen! Where did you get that name? He called the Bellis' house. December '69. "l need to kill. Today's my birthday." lt was his birthday. Arthur Leigh Allen was born on December 18th. Get in here. -Here you go. -Thanks. He wrote me, you know? 2,500 suspects, the only one who everwrote me a letterwas Leigh Allen. They like to help, you know, sometimes. Yes, Robert, l know. He was arrested January 1975 for molestation. He sent me that when he got out. "Dear Dave, if l can ever be of any help to you, just let me know. "l'm sorry l wasn't your man." And it's typewritten. Using a typewriter is not a crime. And he knew Darlene. lt's in the Vallejo files. Mulanax said that he was your favorite suspect. That you spent two years on him, and that nobody ever came close. All the evidence said no. Sherwood disqualified his handwriting. The same Sherwood that drinks like Paul Avery now? ROBERT: Yes, you have Sherwood Morrill in writing saying, "l'm sorry, this just won't work." -But you also have Terry Pascoe... -TOSCHl: His protégé. Yeah, fine, it's his protégé, but he's a handwriting expert nonetheless, and he's saying, "Do not disqualify this suspect on the basis of handwriting." -So the two cancel each other out. -No, they don't. lt was Sherwood's case. He was the head of Questioned Documents. lf it went to trial, all the defense would have to do is call Sherwood to the stand. And there was no way of getting Allen into court in the first place, because there was no evidence, Robert. What do you mean, there's no evidence? You have him seen with the ciphers. The military boot prints. The same size shoes and gloves. The Most Dangerous Game. The Zodiac watch. The background with school children. The misspellings of Christ-mass. The bloody knives. All circumstantial. Paul Stine's shirt, his wallet, his keys. We should have found one of those things in that trailer. -We didn't. -That's... Okay. Catherine Allen states that "Leigh cleaned out his trailer on Friday afterwork "and moved it to Santa Rosa on Saturday, August 7th, 1971 ." You interviewed him at the refinery on August 4th. -Yeah. -So, he's cleaning out his trailer, he's moving into a different county 48 hours after you interviewed him? Okay. Okay. Look at the stuff side by side, Dave. All right. Okay, Arthur Leigh Allen and the Zodiac, their timelines. -When was the first murder in Vallejo? -Christmas, 1968. Eight months before that, Allen is fired for molesting his students and his family discovers that he's a pedophile. -Now, when do the letters begin? -July, '69. After the murder of Darlene Ferrin. And they continue until you go to see him at work. Now, after that, do any of the letters contain swatches of Paul Stine's shirt? No. Because he dumped them, because he got scared. Because he knew that you were on to him. -So, when's the next letter from Zodiac? -Not until January of 1974. He is silent for three years. Then, in '74, he feels comfortable again because everybody's moved off Allen as a suspect. And what do we get? Three new letters from Zodiac in January, May, and July in '74. -But then the letters stop. -What happens to Allen? He's arrested. January, 1975, they send him to Atascadero. We don't get another letter from Zodiac the entire time he's there. -When is he released? -August, '77. Allen gets out. He types you an apology, and then what? We get our first new Zodiac letter in four years. Okay. Zodiac had to have known Darlene Ferrin, right? Yes, because of the phone calls on the night of her murder. Because of the Vallejo file, we know that Darlene knew a man named Leigh? Yes. So, all coincidence aside, Robert, how can you be sure that Leigh Allen is the Leigh from this file? Now, Vallejo is a small town, but it's not that small. How do you put the two of them together? This is a case that's covered both Northern and Southern California, with victims and suspects spread over hundreds of miles. -Would you agree? -Yes. Darlene Ferrin worked at the Vallejo House of Pancakes on the corner of Tennessee and Caroll. Arthur Leigh Allen lived in his mother's basement on Fresno Street. Door to door, that is less than 50 yards. ls that true? l've walked it. Jesus Christ. So? The prints, the handwriting... -l'm not asking you as a cop. -But l am a cop. l can't prove this. Just because you can't prove it, doesn't mean it's not true. Easy, Dirty Harry. Finish the book. Thank you. Thank you for breakfast. (lNDlSTlNCT CHATTERlNG) Can l help you? No. (MUSlC PLAYlNG ON RADlO) (WOMAN CHATTERING ON P.A.) Mr. Mageau. Thanks for coming to see me. You're the one l talked to on the phone? l'm George Bawart. Vallejo PD. l took over for Jack Mulanax. lt's been 22 years. l don't know how l can help you. Well, this is just a formality. l'm gonna show you a group of photographs. Now, the person that shot you may or may not be among these photographs. You don't have to pick anybody out just because l'm showing you these pictures, you understand? Yes, sir, l do. (CLEARS THROAT) All right. Take your time. lfyou don't recognize anyone, that's okay. (CLEARlNG THROAT) That's him. How sure are you? Yeah, l'm pretty sure. He had a round face like this guy. Wait. Am l to understand that you're now identifying the second photograph? No, no. Just that he had a round face like that. lt's this man. All right. Now, on a scale of one to 10, 10 being positive, how sure are you? (CLEARlNG THROAT) At least an eight. The last time l saw this face was July 4th, 1969. l am very sure that's the man who shot me.
