Nikkatsu Corporation Presents - The reception's ending soon. - You don't recognize him? The best gambler in Tokyo. He can't be too young. Older and more refined-looking? Definitely not refined. He's a gambler. A gambler? Deplorable. There's war in Vietnam, but our ambassador... Gambling's much better than war. Exactly. I'm Himuro, the gambler. Marvellous! Imagine playing bridge in Japan! They're top-notch players, Your Excellency. Merci, Monsieur Takakura, they're the very best. It's my business to introduce our best to you, sir. Lost again. My partner's no good. Sorry, sir... I'm out of money. Take this ring instead. - A cat's-eye? - It's 13 carats. Not bad. How about a million yen? That's fine. You're left-handed? My lucky hand. Pass, no... three, no trumps. Wonderful! It's like a miracle. I could kiss your left hand! Shall we continue? I'm sorry, but I'll be going now. Me, too. Score? You two lost 2,400,000 yen. 1,200,000 each? I won't forget this, Mr Himuro. So sorry. I'll make it up to you. You'd better! I never want to see you again. Mr Takakura! I apologize. I wasn't myself. No! Please stop it. That's not enough! We lost 2,400,000. What did you learn in three years? Don't be so strict. I just missed one sign. Listen, if Takakura fires me, neither of us can make a living. It's too late to go back to Kobe. Damn it! A game we couldn't have lost! Five hundred signs. The last deal. It was perfect. As accurate as a computer. Your one mistake made it all go haywire. No luck after that. We're treated like dirt by Himuro. We'll play him and win. Yes, but there's only one way to beat him. No one knows we're a team, not even Himuro. Listen, Reiko, you stick to him... Find out how he does it. Especially the secret of his left hand. - I'll try. - His left hand is the key. He may even be a big phony. But I'll win! I'll show him, with these hands! So he won't dare play cards ever again! THE GAMBLING SYNDICATE Original Story by Toshio Nomura Cinematography by Yoshihiro Yamazaki Editor: Masanori Tsujii Music by Harumi Ibe Cast: Akira Kobayashi Manami Fuji Michiyo Yokoyama Keaton Masuda Asao Koike Isao Tamagawa Masahiko Tanimura Yoshiro Kato Masaya Takahashi Directed by Yasushi Nakahira Hey! Mr Himuro! No, I won't let you go. - It's Ichiroku. - Don't mind him. He'll knock all day. The door is strong enough. Be sensible. You just got back after six months. I've been back 20 days. What's 20 days, when I've waited half a year? Wait! The sun will reproach us. - No, it won't. - Give it a try? Say! Hit the 20,000 yen jackpot. You won? Not me! One of my customers bought 20 and won Â¥400,000. Being an illegal bookie's tough and dangerous work. Mr Himuro. - A hostage? - Yes, but I can't lose face. Help me out, please. That was smart, hitting the 20,000 jackpot. - She did? - Yes, she did. Hello, Mr Himuro. You know her? I'm surprised that you're their boss. I'm glad that you lost to me. I'll pay you, but I haven't lost. I handle affairs and gambling myself. Let's play again. Take it if I lose, double it if I win. You've got to win? I said I wouldn't forget, didn't I? Help! Sorry, they'll kill me. Pretend you're my friends. Sounds serious. What's going on? I'm being chased by Yang's man. Explain. I was a fool. I lost all my money at poker. I'm Nina, a stewardess. I met Yang on the plane from Hong Kong. I took three days off in Tokyo... but I lost all my money, so I borrowed from him. When I lost that, he tried to rape me. I escaped from him. - How much did you lose? - $800. That's 300,000 yen. What's this? You're vulgar! No reason to take it! This? I bought it in Hong Kong, for my brother. I'll challenge him. - What a busy boy! - Take me to his place. I'm so scared. I want to leave now. You two, take her to Toto. - I'll deal with you later. - Wait. I'll go with you. You'll win back what she lost? How interesting. And this lovely lady is your wife? - No, we're enemies. - Enemies? I came to watch him lose. I won't meddle in the game. Interesting, very interesting! Let's begin then. Beautiful lady, take that seat please. The bet's 3 million. Is that okay? Fine. - You don't mind? - Please. I'm a dabbler. I don't know poker etiquette. The rules? Standard draw poker. That's all I know. - No wildcard? - No. It's too dark! A light! I have weak eyes. They trouble me at night. How inconvenient. My weak eyes trouble me. Be happy, lady. Luck's coming my way. You're very good. Many of my rich friends are coming to visit Japan... I'll introduce you. Let's play together. Excuse me. Do you think it'll reflect the cards? I'll put it away. Great! Wonderful! I've no more money. So you lost? I've about 300,000 yen. You turncoat. When did you go over to his side? I didn't mean that. How much for this? 200,000 yen. - What? - No more. Don't sell it then. Alright. A light, please? Are you picking me up? Well, I don't get it at all. Why? What's the matter? Let's continue, or my luck will change. Most cheats I know. But I can't figure out how he does it. Will you continue with a phony hand? I'll match his bluff. Don't worry. He won't find out. Wait in your room. I won't. I came to see you lose. Mr Himuro, no more confidential talks. Let's begin. Okay, let's play. 20,000. Raise 20,000. You make me happy. A worthwhile game. Raise 40,000. Raise 70,000. Raise 100,000. Full house of kings and queens. My win? By your rules, a full house beats two pairs? You have two pairs? Two aces and two threes, I believe. You're right. Wait! How come? How did he know? He's scamming, or he wouldn't have known. I know that... He even told me so. That's because he knows I can't read him. Sleep. If you get a good sleep, your left hand will win. Your room? You just noticed? You must be happy that I lost. Not yet. It isn't the same as if I'd won. How come? How did he know? Who is he, anyway? I slept well. Our game comes after I win from Yang. Wait! Are you sure? I'm done for if you lose. Don't worry, take this. - It's worth about 500,000 yen. - You're crazy. Take it anyway. Be sure to do what I asked. Leave it to me. Hi there. Are you still after me? Want more trouble? Did you pawn your watch to buy tickets? - To beat Yang. - You'll only lose again. I'll keep playing until I figure him out. Ruby cufflinks, a gold lighter. They're not just for show. Go ahead, then. Betting on the favourite? That's 4-6. I got 1-3. Plain silly! Hey, Reiko! Princess, don't be heartless. I've no money. You haven't? Let's bet how much you have in your purse. And if you win... - What do I get? - Let's see... Guess what I have here. What do you think I have? - Hi. - Oh, it's you. Have I caught you at the wrong time, Detective? No. It's government-sponsored gambling! By the way, in the sixth race? 1-3. 1-3? Don't make a fool of me. - Who's he? - My father. - What? Viscount Anekoji. He was famous in Monaco and Macao. 1-3 won. 50,000 becomes 2 million. You can't beat me. The game isn't over yet. Wait a moment. What's the time? Let's go someplace else. The main event is after this. Who'll win? - It's clear: the Japanese will lose. - The challenger? Thanks. - Mr Himuro. - Is he here? A success. I've got a girl on him. No one's here. Wrong number! Fool, it's me. Find anything? A big surprise. Don't scare me. There's nothing here... but he must be a buyer. My fellow countryman, so I know. I like this room, anyway... I'll take a bath before I come back. I know, I know, I'll leave now! A call for Mr Yang from Kobe. No, wait! Go ahead, please... See?! I was right! You pay me. Pay me. You lost again. Let's go someplace else. - No shopping. - Shut up. Welcome. There are more in the back. Please. You're bothering the other guests. Please leave. Excuse me... I thought it was a better joint. Mr Himuro, you needn't leave if you'll listen to me. I've heard you're a loner... I'll give you 10%, no, 15% of your take. How's that? I decline... I hate to be chained. I was born that way. - Loan me 50,000 yen. - Better you quit. - Don't then. - Take my watch. - No, only cash. But if you undress one garment at a time, we'll bet 2,000 yen against it. Alright. - But let me shake, too. - As you wish. Ladies first. Come on, take it off! That's unfair! I didn't say in what order. Give me a break. This is fraud! Bet! Even. Here we go! It's odd. Take off your panties now! - I won at last. - Wait! You used your lipstick as slip-stopper, didn't you? She's a cheat! Come on, let's strip her! What the hell?! Act your age. If you can do it, play and win from me first. You bastard! Here's 2 million yen. One game. It's yours if I lose. If I win, I get her and her clothes. Okay, but don't back out if you lose. - Odds! - Evens! Cut it out! You've been using loaded dice, haven't you? How dare you! - The door's locked! - Go find them there. Are they on the top? Why did you do that? It's not professional. Professional? Spill it now... You're Inumaru's woman, a branded cheat. I knew it from the beginning. I thought you did... but I still want to beat you. - Blood will tell. - Blood? Yes, I suppose you're right. I learned how to gamble at 18... I had no idea why my father wasted our money like crazy. He kept gambling it away. When I was 18, he and Inumaru had a big game... My father lost everything. In the end, he bet me. I was won by Inumaru like poker chips. I didn't even cry. Poker chips never cry, right? That night, I vowed to become an unbeatable gambler. But you beat me quite thoroughly. Take me! You all bet on me and you won. I hate to be a loser. I never want to lose to anyone. Don't shout. This is not because I won, but because you're beautiful. I've repaid my debt. Just for the record. Okay, if that's the way you want it. It's me. Where have you been? I called many times. Tailing after him, like you said. I couldn't call you. - Is he suspicious? - No, he isn't. Himuro blew a bundle at poker. Who did he play? He's staying at that hotel? How could you stay away for two days? - None of your business. - Who's that foreign girl? She spoke your name as if she was your wife. Sorry that I didn't call you. Forget her. She's a gambling-crazy kid. Drop her, then! I can gamble if I want to. Don't be silly. I'm thinking about Yang, the Chinese guy. A gambler, too? It's strange... Didn't Ichiroku turn up? I said not, didn't I? - Now listen to me. - I will. This is your bar. Stay put. Don't be silly. It's yours. - But you bought it. - My present to you. What's wrong with my face? Don't. It's too bright. I get it. Now I know Yang's ploy. Ichiroku, maybe. Ichiroku? He's dead. So you and Mr Himuro want to play poker with me? Yes, in a grand manner, at the swankiest place. Very interesting... My friends are coming to Japan soon. I'll call them for a big game. It'll be great fun. Excuse me, but is this your monocle? Yes, it is. Your friends will arrive soon? - So what? - Nothing... I look forward to it. You know me, don't you? How can I? We've just met. Liar! You know I'm Yang, of the International Gambling Syndicate. Don't give yourself away. I wasn't sure. I heard about you from a foreigner in Kobe. Too bad, Mr Inumaru... Malcolm, the boss, has to come to Japan as a tourist! He can't enter Japan if he's known as a gambler. That's his way. You called, sir? Yes, I did. I'm in the same business as you. I'd like to play with professionals. His body was found in a sewer outlet at Tokyo Port. - Cause of death? - Cyanide gas... Murdered, of course. Any ideas? No. He had 30 tickets on 1-6, a dark horse... it won yesterday. The first time he bet, he won big money on a dark horse. Maybe he always bet on 1-6. He was like that. He was a good guy. Malcolm... Malcolm? So... I've no time to play tag. Don't worry. You'll have plenty of time. Inumaru and I will deal with them. I'm impressed you knew about them. Ichiroku was killed by them. I've got to avenge my man. Malcolm, a Jew, supplied the Nazis in the war by gambling. He shows no mercy at the tables. Watch out. Oh, Himuro! Where have you been? I almost died, worrying about you. Almost died? How dare you! She frightens me. Is she your wife? No. Let's have a quiet talk. I couldn't contact you. I lost to Yang. - I knew it. - I'll play again tonight. Yang's friends arrived today. I'll invite them to "Hanayu" to gamble. You'd better wait here. You're late. Let's begin! Why are you here? I'm lucky with lotteries. I won the first prize... Okay, you're in. Hi, Mr Himuro. Glad to see you. I feel uneasy in such a place. I thought you'd bring more friends. They're going elsewhere... Many places to play in Tokyo. Very good. I'm just having fun. It's not an earthquake. Just subway construction. It's to make Japan a first class nation; please put up with it. Please continue, sir. - What will you do with these fish? - To amuse the company... Rays have enough poison in their tails to kill people. We'll bet on which one wins. Please bet. Please. - What is she? - A gambler. Well, well, young lady. Nice to see you again. - 3,000 on white. - 5,000 on red. - 5,000 on white. - 8,000 on red. Not enough on white. More bets on white. White. - White. - 30,000 on white. Red. 50,000 on red. - It's fun. - 50,000 on white. Bets closed. We'll begin. A draw. Neither won. - Money's down to half. - It can't be. You can never win. Why are you here? What's so funny? They're not mere rich tourists. A gambling syndicate? Quiet! Some of them are killers, too. This is bad! Why did the police let them into the country? Use me again. Only I can stop them. - A good trick, Inumaru. - What? About to be deceived again. They lost on purpose, in order to win big later. That's enough. Get out. Come back when you've paid your dues under Himuro. I won both of them. I'm mad. I lost again. I won 2,800,000. What will you do now? Sorry, but this type of gambling is not in our line... If you don't mind, that's enough for tonight. I'll play. Good fun! Haven't you learned your lesson yet? I've 3,000,000 yen. One game. Bet your Â¥2.8 million and my ring. Sure, I know very well how you feel. I have it right here. If I don't look at them, you can't win. What do you mean? If you don't look at them, you can't win, either. No, but there is a way... Get me that light. Turn off all the other lights. You can't see the cards in my eyes, even with your magnifying monocle. One more card. Game! That was too bad. I shall leave. Leaving? Wait! I've got to go. Can you take her home? Hey, wait for me! Silence, please. We'll continue. - When did you get here? - Just now. Why are Yang's men after him? He discovered Yang cheating. He'll be killed! Any reason he shouldn't be? Nothing could be better. Right? Answer me! - You're in love with him? - No, you're wrong! Sorry to keep you waiting. I got your money back. You won from Yang? Thanks. - You're bleeding. - Yang's men attacked me... but we're safe now. Well... Tokyo looks good from up here. - What's up? - Nothing. Just talk. I'm scared. Tell me. Powder room's on the right? - The terrace? - Just up ahead. When I leave, follow at a distance. - Tell me what's going on. - They're here. Run! Don't look down. Come on, smile. Give me a smile. Himuro, won't you join me? Bad boy, you shouldn't go through my bag. - For your brother? - Yeah. Ichiroku was killed with cyanide gas. - What's that got to do with me? - What's in it? Water. It's a water pistol. - Is it? Want me to try it? - Stop joking! Who did you call earlier? My hotel, to say I won't be back. Give me the number. I'll call. There's more. Why were Yang's men there? You're with Yang's group? You intended to trap me from the beginning. Tell me, or I'll kill you. I hate to kill, but I'll do it for Ichiroku. You can't pick up best friends like you pick up girls. I'll tell you everything. I'm Malcolm's woman. I was told to kill you tonight, but I can't... TWO FOREIGNERS, A MAN AND A WOMAN, FOUND DEAD - Madame has disappeared. - What? She disappeared the day after you hid out here. Another dirty trick! - Killed like Ichiroku? - Don't be silly. - Someone threw this in this morning. - You should've said that first. "Himuro, call 401-1683." Wait here. If I'm not out in an hour, report it. Don't do as they say. They'll kill you. They wouldn't have given their phone number if they meant to. I'll think after I hear their demands. It was you, Inumaru! Too bad I disappointed you. - Takakura's orders? - Takakura? I bet he's cooling his head with ice now. He didn't listen to me. Malcolm wiped him out, so he became my man. What do you want me to do? Malcolm's throwing a big party tomorrow, a gambling party. - I know that. - Don't butt in! Not just tomorrow. Never gamble again! Because you can't beat me? Shut up! I want to be the world's best. I've trained hard for 10 years. You can't ruin me! If I beat Malcolm, I'll become famous. It's the chance I've been waiting for. I won't kill you. Just be quiet for a while... if you want your woman back safely. Reiko, come out. Watch the fun. Stop that! You said you don't love him... I want proof you won't gamble again. This is the proof. Good to see you two. You look pale, princess. Father! What's up? Don't scare a poor old man. Comfort her. She's sad because I maimed the man she loves. I'm not much good at that. Cheer up, come on. See? You depend on me alone. It's better like this. He'll be just an ordinary guy. Yes, he's better off this way. - What time is it? - Are you alright? The time?! It's 4pm. - The party's at 6? - No way! My dice. Still playing? Haven't you had enough? My dice! What the hell?! Pinball is better. What's the matter? Not up to par? I'm playing now. You're the only man I have. You won't lose, will you? Yang's like a baby without his monocle. Leave it to me. What shall we play first, Viscount? I still remember that game in Monaco 8 years ago. You were great. I'm still in fine shape, Your Excellency. What's going on? He hung onto that tuxedo. He wants to be buried in it. Oh, I forgot my wallet. Loan me 500,000. Of course, with pleasure. I'll double it and return it to you. Let's begin. Go now. You're very welcome. Thank you, but unfortunately I injured my hand. I'll just watch instead. Your Excellency! Be quiet! - A coup d'Ã©tat! - Not my fault! You've been released! New government? Red or Conservative? - How goes it? - Your hand? Nothing. Your luck? My luck's run out! I'm the man without any luck. Only 5,000 yen left. I got 500,000 gratis. I need 5 million yen today. Wait, there's still a chance. Keep the last 5,000 yen. - Keep on playing, Inumaru. - Shut up! I see. Zero. Same number again. - I can't believe it. - Same number again. You all bet, too. Closing, after only two games? That's quite stingy of you. The party's over, folks! Thank you very much. Reiko. You two remain. Where's Father? Himuro and Inumaru. We can't just let you leave. Bet all your winnings. We'll play the cards just once. Alright. We'll play our way. With our techniques. You mean, using a phony hand? That's right... One man shuffles once, riffle-shuffles once... then arranges a spade, heart, diamond and club in order, then a straight four. Can you do it? I'll try. You got it? Let's start. You've grown old, Malcolm. The international rule is not to harm men in a gambling den. Give me my money. The game's over. Not yet. Father! My game, the one that's been on my mind for the last three years. Here's 5 million yen, Inumaru... The amount I bet my own daughter for. I want to replay the same game again. You're too easy-going. You won't let us go? I'd love to, but no stairs here. The elevators have stopped. We'll honour the rule till you leave this room. After that, professionals will handle it. You gamblers ignore the law. No one will look for you. Someone will... A crack police detective is somewhere in this building. Liar! Don't move! I arrest you for murder and illegal gambling! Patrol cars and paddy-wagons are on the way. Give yourselves up! You interfering meddler! I didn't want to reveal myself like this. I was doing my job. I had to, or I'd be dead. I'm counting on you. Idiot! You'll regret this! To the emergency exit! Where are those three? Idiots! How the hell...? We're cornered! We need time. Don't let them up. - Got your money? - No time for that. - It'll all be confiscated. - Cut it. - What? Let's settle it anyway... Take a card. What are you doing? Are you crazy?! You have no luck, after all. Damn it! Reiko, you're back to where you were three years ago. But if you choose to be with me... No, you wouldn't. That's for sure. No time for that! Lots of them are coming now! - That's useful. - Dynamite! No, fireworks. Take that! - This is fun! - You're a poor cheat. - How dare you! - You hid the card. Are you joking? I played fair and lost fairly. That's dangerous! I'll blow up 10 men! He did it, but he meant himself, too! - Good night, sir. - Thanks. What's this? We came for them, sir. The gamblers. You see, don't you see? C'mon, let's go away for a while. Where are you going? Don't say you're relegated. Idiot! Don't make me say that. I got the gamblers, but handed them over to bogus cops. If I were my chief, I'd transfer me out, too. I can't return to Tokyo for a while, either. Mister... Won't you try? - What? - Got a ticket? Bet if the last number is odds or evens.
