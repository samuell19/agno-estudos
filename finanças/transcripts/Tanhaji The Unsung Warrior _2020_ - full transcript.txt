What would you do? It will be destroyed A new war was about to begin War between the two angels Instead of singing He sat on the elephant and welcomed the war with an army of eighty thousand And neither side was of the same strength "There was concern about the face of" Shivaji Ajay wanted to conquer a large part of the country Then Shivaji ruled those parts So there was no other way but war Keep us alive, God remove the sadness from us And we gave strength Now you just let us know The Marathi army is alive Or it will be destroyed by these monsters Shivaji was afraid and needed more power He was under attack from both sides - Can't say much, but for how long? No matter how prepared we are But we are weak against them If we want to defeat the enemy We do not accept failure There is only one way To make peace Send someone to tell me I'm going to go ahead with myself Going to the Mongols means digging your grave with your own hands But Shivaji of people and his soldiers were important to the castle "Burandar" June 11, 1665 "Brother" Umrah Konkan Brother I have bad news for you His entire Shivaji government surrendered including here The enemy took advantage of the situation Shivaji Prison And to get many benefits They have started the crime again in the eyes of everyone And the resumption of looting What do you do?

Long live the Mongolian verdict. Congratulation But we are happy with that This will not last long Whatch out Madam Don't wear shoes? The air is very hot and your feet are very cold - His land may not burn I will not wear shoes until our flag is raised again "Umrah with our land, as I delivered my shoes to" Mughals God, we will wait for victory again Four years later Four years have passed Today, in some areas, the Mughal flag was raised, the Rajad Fort But everyone still has hope On a clear day, King Shivaji managed to escape from the Mongols and return Then they brought him some news Sir, I teach you As if you came with great concern The news is... That of Delhi government He still wants to control the entire country An army of two thousand men was sent to command the rotor hall Oedipan !? His name is very famous Thirty-three years It is very dangerous and the world is very trusting But the universe does not trust anyone, sir A few months ago, the king of Iran was in Agra with his guests on the Yamuna Agra River And play in the world of human chess Here is the king of the universe This is a horse step "I forgot the king's soldier," Pahlavi said Move your spine first I'm here too Let's take a serious step to destroy the soldier The scientist was very happy with Audipan's courage and made him part of the Royal Guard And one night Red Fort Delhi Sir Odeban brought me tomorrow All he asked, sir Why stand up I want to conquer all of India ... and I want to The "Mughal" flag is raised throughout the lands And I want my master... the mission of this great and precious work I get it for you... We also opened half of India so far We also control half the other half I am very happy for your dedication and loyalty So it will make you my commander in command On that day I became a leader This is not a devil But it is nothing less than Satan And now the devil has poisonous force and snake The power of Audipan! Or his army of two thousand is not so important The important thing is that he has an important weapon The poisonous snake's name It could reach thousands of revolutions Can destroy a city with one shot The larger and more resistant walls are also unable to withstand it If you can get here The restoration of "India" may become a dream - You are talking about failure and telling the truth Before fighting we must learn from defeat It is not easy as you think I myself accept the leadership of this war No, sir It is not a problem if thousands of soldiers die in this war But do not let the catastrophe be upon you, dear one thousand come to mind There is another leader... Who could have won this war... "Commander" Tanhaji Malusere Infinite person But we cannot tell him now Why don't we say, sir? At home where a girl will marry One should not speak of murder For the first time in many years Happiness has come to her home "Everyone fled with fear." When I show my sword Everything was one and a half and I believed in the Moon "We are all very brave men." From now on, we will celebrate every day "From today there is nothing wrong with reaching the" moon "There was smoke and darkness everywhere." "I gave him the light." It gave us strength and blessings and restored happiness All the blessings she gave us made us laugh Thank you for coming to my house.

As of today there is nothing wrong with "everything on our way to the" moon Are you missing my father? Whenever I hold this sword in my hands I remember something... He always said Tania will get married very beautiful But the world did not give him a chance With the sword you make your blood So if you cry, they no longer believe in your strength "I will win every war," Savitri said But in this war I always lose I will not let you lose We are holding a wonderful marriage, Raiba Its convoy is very colorful... People only look My father will be happy wherever he is What if I see one? There is nothing wrong with "Parvati" at the foot of Shankar, the goddess But if I sat on the feet of my husband, there is nothing wrong with that Amra, who will meet the couple a lot Yes, this But we only see each other's eyes when we see ourselves I want to see both of us together We do not see each other in this small mirror He is coming now I say beautiful lady and leader here too But I do not understand what her relationship with the leader is I told you he is a demon But he seems to be interested in humans Wow the commander is watching How do I destroy it? You will definitely be ruined A widow raised from her husband's mourning What man commits this sin? When he gets angry, he becomes red But you will become whiter and thinner like the moon God-fearing, adobeian The fear of God raised my blood But this desire is also fulfilled with my blood And now he wants it It goes on my body wherever you are I also I do not change my name either Because my name is also attractive to me Shankariya Yes brother Until I came back with Shivaji Until then your eyes and sword should be very careful I now have protection here Boy, yes The sun is shining from above And you never end of your nap Shut up, let's go Shivajia "knows you a lot" Let me tell you the truth that today there is nothing against you If you think there is strength "Shivaraj" ideas completely changed the country and history I think you change history, too Another person is writing history, so this is it Who writes?
