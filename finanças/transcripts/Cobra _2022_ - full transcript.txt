Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. It gives us immense pleasure in introducing the speaker for tonight. A billionaire who took the world of commerce by storm. Whose stocks skyrocketed leaving the entire business fraternity amused. A true visionary, and with a golden heart. A compassionate philanthropist who stands for humanity... and cares for the underprivileged. Who tries making life better for the entire human race. He is a demon. A heartless cold-blooded demon who doesn't value human life at all. Thousands of people have already died because of Rishi. He poisoned the very air we breathe. We are going to suffer from its effects for several years. Despite being responsible for thousands of deaths, Rishi is going to reopen his factory. He is a heartless monster. After several years of protest... the ex-CM heeded our protests and shut this factory down. But he is no more today. Are you trying to threaten me? I can put you behind bars for life if I wanted to. I'm just being considerate because you are a little kid. The ban on your factory stays. I've sent a letter to the PM's office recommending your company be blacklisted. Forget about Orissa. You can't set foot in any part of India. Not even an inch. Guards! Mr. Chief Minister... Mr. Chief Minister... This is getting me really excited for the payback. I'll be back. Back again. You loss will be much more severe. Put your hands together to welcome the youngest and most prolific entrepreneur... who stamped his authority in over 175 countries. Rajiv Rishi of Rishi Corporations. Truth will triumph! When my father died and left me in charge of Rishi Corporations... I was 17 years old. People wondered how a young boy like me would manage such a big company. They underestimated me. "He is just a little boy. He can't do squat!" They mocked me. But I rose against them even as they tried to put me down. I've led the company from nowhere into the Top 5 Companies in the US. Nothing feels as good as beating your doubters in their own turf and sitting before them like a king. It's such a lovely feeling. When you wants to do good for the nation, hundreds of people will try to stop you. Poor guys. Let them try to stop you. Let's do the best we can. Jai Hind. Thank you. O Lord Muruga... Welcome, sir. Hey, Mr. Reporter... How are you doing, journalist Nellaiyappan? Yeah... I'm okay, Nawab Sir. So... Looks like your boss gave an interview. I saw it on TV. What does he say? He is happy. All thanks to you. The Orissa CM had challenged he'd shut down Rishi Corporations. Your guy did the job perfectly. I need to meet him. Where is he? He doesn't meet anyone. He won't work for anyone else either. It's not easy to get to him. He doesn't own a cellphone, or use WhatsApp or e-mail. He doesn't even have an Aadhaar card. He says it's for his own safety. But that's not even the main issue. If I reveal his identity and give you his contact information... I'd be out of business, won't I? You talk really well, Nellai. This isn't like the Orissa CM job. The whole world will be watching. If you have even a small element of doubt, now is the time to back out. You said we'd get to the point, so skip past the unnecessary talk! Just tell me where the money is, so that I can get started. I also need to shower here before I can leave! Hello? Can you hear me? Yes, I can. "Backing out" doesn't exist in his dictionary. Nobody can save the Prince of Scotland now. Not even you. Nobody can save the Prince of Scotland now. Nobody can save the Prince of Scotland now. Go save the prince! Save the prince, save the prince... Save the prince! Go save the prince! Save the prince, save the prince... Save the prince! Chief, all Interpol servers have been hacked. But we haven't been able to identify the hacker. We are unable to stop this too. But trust me chief, this is something next to impossible. Officer, absolutely nothing to worry. The Prince is absolutely safe and sound. By the way, why should I trust this information? I'm not sure. Our servers got hacked and we got this information. But you know no ordinary man can do this. This must be a mere hoax, officer. Moreover, today is The Prince's Royal Wedding. You know how tight the security system is for an event like the royal wedding. Nobody can save the Prince of Scotland now. Officer, we have verified every single guest in the church through several security checks. We can see all the details about any of our guests through the click of a button. Their activities since last week, the places they visited, the people they met etc. Today, nobody can even dream of getting anywhere close to the prince. Anyways... thanks, officer. We will take it from here. James, play all the channels that are telecasting the Royal Wedding. Ladies and gentlemen and Christ... let me tell you about the supreme power that has brought all of us here today. The power that cares. The power that heals. The power that fuels the universe. Today, two beautiful young people are united by this powerful phenomenon called love. There is power in love. There is power in love to help, and heal when nothing else can. There is power to love and lift up and liberate when nothing else will. Set this love as a stamp on your heart. A stamp on your mind. A stamp on your soul. Francis, that isn't Augustus. What? This isn't Fr. Augustus Ledox. Father, that is him. No! - People always ask me... "Father, why do all the scriptures teach love?" Oh, shit! That does look like him. Love is kind. It does not envy. It does not boast. Someone is in danger there. It keeps no record of the wrongs. - Who is that man? Love is in the music of the birds, the dance of the trees... the lull of the ocean. I heard there is love in every single atom of the air that surrounds us. I can experience that divine love... in the beautiful faces of the Prince of Scotland... and the Princess to be.

And how did he precisely time the fall of the chandelier? What's the theory behind that? The bulb contained liquid nitrogen. It corroded the steel chain of the chandelier. The corrosion made the chain weaker. Take Titanic as an example. A huge ship which broke upon collision with an iceberg. Ship manufacturers stopped using pure steel only after the Titanic incident. Not just that. He also used cyanide shots which killed the Prince in a fraction of a second. Aslan... I need to talk to you about your case. We've received a lot of mails from this ID over the last six months. I opened it by chance yesterday. And I found this document. This was sent by a Criminology Professor named Bhavana Menon. From Chennai, India. Chennai? Yes. This is a thesis report written by one of her students. This mentions several similarities between... the Scotland Prince's assassination case which you are handling... and the assassination of a Chief Minister in India last year. Cobra. I read the complete report and it sounds plausible. General, there are several rumours and theories floating around regarding this case. This must be one of them. Do you seriously think an undergrad college student who doesn't even know all the case details... could have possibly cracked a case as big as this? Yeah. I guess I should investigate the killing that happened in India... before I reach a conclusion. I am leaving for Chennai in the next flight. It's been a long time since I've been there. Who is he looking for? Does the train come late just for him? Bhavana, why are you late? Little one... Okay, got it. Where were you? - Sister! Sit down. You missed it today. There were a lot of claps and applause! Check this trophy out! Here is something to go with the trophy! The 49th wedding invite of my students. Display it in your showcase and celebrate it! My students are going around having babies at the age of 19-20. Yesterday, one of them invited me to her daughter's 5th birthday. But look at me! Yeah, it must be really hard on Bhavana. Look there. That's one of her students. She looks so happy with her granddaughter! No, you don't get it. Cute counters like this will work. You don't need to do shit! Your friend is way past the age of sweet talk and cute love. Stop behaving like 40s kids! 40s kids? "If everyone in your family agrees to the wedding..." Like hell they will. Do you know how hard it is to be in love with you? You don't use a phone, or WhatsApp, or mail. He doesn't even use himself! My sisters are worried I've been living in your house for 4 years. So they've found groom for me. They are going to bring him to our house in two days. What should I do now? You! Open your mouth and say something! Speak up! Say something. Well... Yeah? Well...? The train is here. Let's go. - Poor woman, give her an answer... Stop playing around, Mathi. I really can't take this anymore. Do you like me or not? You know my family won't agree to this. But you keep saying the same thing over and over again. Is there something else on your mind? You need to tell me what it is. See, I just want you to be there for me. And I want to be there for you, and give up my life to protect yours. Don't talk this way. Please! Welcome, sir. Glad to meet you. Good morning, officers. Good morning, Interpol Sir. I am Anand Subramaniam. The investigating officer for the Orissa CM's assassination case. Since the CMs of three states were attending a function at the same venue... we had heavy security in the venue. National Security Guards, and 350 CRPF officers. Last year, on December 20th, at exactly 10:15... the Orissa CM arrived at the venue. This was the seating arrangement for the function. The CM's seat was third from the left. It was a very closed event. So we'd finalised the seating arrangements for the functions several months in advance. At exactly 12:21, when the CM got up to deliver his speech... from the 8th floor balcony of the building to his left... gun shots were fired. The bullets were fired exactly from a trajectory angle of 118 to 120 degrees. And one of those bullets... hit the CM on the left of his temple... and he collapsed. We confirmed this with the entry wound. We found that they'd setup a local country made gun which was triggered remotely. Based on the remote censor used in the gun... we found out that they operated it from within a 2 km radius. This is the work of their state's Naxals. They are the ones who use a lot of country made guns. These are our findings, sir. We need to go to Coimbatore tomorrow. I need to see the venue. Sure, sir. They told me a Turkish officer would be coming from Paris. So I dusted my books and started brushing up my English. But your Tamil is good enough to teach Tamil teachers! Sir, a student who came to see you is creating a scene out there. Hey, who are you? Excuse me! Did you think this was your school's blackboard? What the hell is happening here? Is there a show going on here? Hey, idiot! Ask her to stop, man! Get down, miss. I'm done! So you are the investigating officer for this case? Was it you who came up with the Naxal theory? Such terrible investigation, sir. Excuse me? You better mind your language. Okay, okay! So you are officer Aslan. Interpol, right? Hi! Sorry, hi! I am Judith Samson. You can call me Judy. What's all this? This is the actual investigation of your case. His theory has a dinosaur sized loophole. Do you have two minutes? Hold this. Play this when I tell you to. It's true that they did fire the gun remotely to carry out the assassination. But... it wasn't any of the bullets he mentioned which actually killed the CM. That isn't even possible. So, what's your theory? Let's just imagine... this was the CM's position at the podium when he was standing. This might sound hard to believe. But this is maths. Numbers don't lie, uncle. He single-handedly managed to pull off such a complicated plan so effortlessly! You are looking for a genius who breathes numbers every single second of his life. Don't be silly and look for him here, uncle. He must be living among numbers in the biggest math centre in the world. You should look there, uncle. Two threes are...? - Two threes are six. Algebra is not hard, Ashwini. - Come on. Very good. Superb! - Come on, Mathi! I'm coming! Go back to your class. I don't like the sight of your friend's face. He is upto something. The Iron Man is always right about these things. Be wary, son! I've made note of it. - Sure thing! Good night. I have no idea what you are noticing! He is here. Run, run, run. Here I am. He is not getting away today! Mathi... Oh no, where did I leave it? Where is it? Where is it? - Under the tree. Here? Under the bushes? There it is. - Kumaresan... What are you looking for? - Found it. I can take it out now. What is this? Ask anyone in the universe, and they will tell you this is a bottle. And that's booze inside it. I'll teach you how to drink it with style like an Englishman. The kids are waiting for me. It's getting late. Is it something important? Whatever it is, I can tell you only after a half an hour time-lapse. Sit down. Even after drinking two bottles, he still hasn't opened up his heart. Is he human or what! I can't stand this guy's antics after drinking just two glasses! Oh, dear! Why don't you fall in love and get married, Mathi? It could be a beautiful professor... or a girl who fell head-over-heels for you and stayed in your house for four years... or maybe a girl named Bhavana. You have several such options. Why don't you tick one of the options, fall in love, and get married? Let me be frank, Mathi... I don't know what the girl sees in you. But she is always around you. She is willing to leave everything behind for you. Please think about it, Mathi. If you marry Bhavana... your whole life will turn beautiful. Bhavana, that poor thing. Mathi, I feel sorry for Bhavana... Kumaresan, are you okay? This guy... - No, sister! The poor guy's only got a little bit of respect left around here. So don't hit him with your slippers. Maybe the broom... no, use this instead. The girl got you booze hoping you'd open up, but you aren't saying anything! Please admit to it. Sister, couldn't you find anyone better? I know how much you like her. Please admit to it, Mathi. ♪ Tharangini Tharangini Gini-Ni gini-Ni giNi ♪ ♪ Tharangini Tharangini Tharana- tharangini ♪ ♪ Tharangini Tharangini ♪ ♪ Gini-Ni gini-Ni giNi ♪ ♪ Tharangini Tharangini ♪ ♪ Tharana- tharangini ♪ ♪ Tharangini! ♪ ♪ Tharangini! ♪ ♪ She never lets me feel alone ♪ ♪ In my dreams and my reality ♪ ♪ She never lets go of me ♪ ♪ She's the personification of sweetness ♪ ♪ My first feeling of tenderness ♪ ♪ Makes me want to drown in her femininity ♪ ♪ When this beauty comes close to me ♪ ♪ I find my six senses failing me ♪ ♪ Buried treasures would break open the earth ♪ ♪ And present itself to me ♪ ♪ Like the snow on a flame ♪ ♪ Melts and drips down ♪ ♪ And though my heart has melted ♪ ♪ This repeats as though on loop ♪ ♪ My heart melts for her ♪ ♪ She's the lighthouse to my life ♪ ♪ She's my pillar in darkness ♪ ♪ She's got eyes of peacock feathers ♪ ♪ She's made it rain over me ♪ ♪ Tharangini Tharangini ♪ ♪ Gini-Ni gini-Ni giNi ♪ ♪ Tharangini Tharangini ♪ ♪ Tharana- tharangini ♪ ♪ To steal you away every day ♪ ♪ I await for the dawn ♪ ♪ I cast the net of dreams for you ♪ ♪ Isn't that the most pristine prison? ♪ ♪ What's the use of a clock to you and me? ♪ ♪ You scratch my heart like fingernails ♪ ♪ I break free like a flooded river ♪ ♪ Even if I tell you to go ♪ ♪ Please don't ever leave ♪ ♪ Tharangini Tharangini ♪ ♪ Gini-Ni gini-Ni giNi ♪ ♪ Tharangini Tharangini ♪ ♪ Tharana- tharangini ♪ ♪ My first feeling of tenderness ♪ ♪ Makes me want to drown in her femininity ♪ ♪ When this beauty comes close to me ♪ ♪ I find my six senses failing me ♪ ♪ Buried treasures would break open the earth ♪ ♪ And present itself to me ♪ ♪ Like the snow on a flame ♪ ♪ Melts and drips down ♪ ♪ And though my heart has melted ♪ ♪ This repeats as though on loop ♪ ♪ My heart melts for her ♪ ♪ Tharangini Tharangini ♪ ♪ Gini-Ni gini-Ni giNi ♪ ♪ Tharangini Tharangini ♪ ♪ Tharana- tharangini ♪ ♪ Tharangini Tharangini ♪ ♪ Gini-Ni gini-Ni giNi ♪ ♪ Tharangini Tharangini ♪ ♪ Tharana- tharangini ♪ Sir, the gunshots were fired from that apartment balcony. But there is such a huge structure in front of the stage. The shots would have hit the structure, right? Based on the entry wound... you guessed that the bullet that hit the CM was fired from an angle of 118 to 120 degrees. That's okay... but it's not possible to shoot from that angle from the building you mentioned. They couldn't have even seen the CM from that building. So, what's your theory? Ricochet effect. Listen... instead of a bullet, imagine a fast approaching car. Okay? When it rams straight into a wall... it ricochets, that is bounces off the wall, and moves in the opposite direction. But if the collision happens at an angle, it moves in another direction depending on the angle. Now imagine if the car hits a moving object, like a train, from an angle. Due to the train's speed... it will travel in some other angle with several times the original force. Excuse me! How did such a fast moving object end up in this hall? If I'm not wrong... near the window through which the bullet entered the building... there must definitely be a wall mounted fan. A fan that rotates at 400 rpm in anti-clockwise direction. Anand... Sir... The assassin must have been seated 4th or 5th in the 2nd row of the balcony... to get this 118 to 120 degree ricochet angle. Chief! Buddy... He waited for the right time, and remotely fired the gun which was outside. He must have blind-sided everyone by triggering it from inside the hall. Judy is the university topper in mathematics. She left her home and her parents to focus on maths and research. She chose criminology as her main elective in her final semester. She got obsessed with this case. She discovered that there was maths involved in every single aspect of this case. And that's how she came up with her thesis. The Cobra. Wow, what a surprise! I knew you'd eventually come to me. But this was too fast. Anyway, welcome peeps. Hi, ma'am. So, CBI Uncle... do you believe me atleast now? In this case, your theory definitely makes sense. Accepted. But what's the connection between the assassinations in Scotland and France and this case? So far, maths is the only connection. He used the blind spot in France to escape. He increased the sound to 120 decibels at the church wedding... and used the vibrations to blast the crystal bulb. He calculated that the liquid nitrogen in it would drip onto the steel chain and corrode it... and that the chain would be unable to bear the 3.5 tonne load and eventually snap. And the calculation that when it falls from a height of 25 feet... it will fall with a force of 300 Pascals and split the ground open! Maths was the only common factor in each and every single move. Then how did he find the tunnel and escape? Aslan, that church was built in the 16th century. Back in those days in Scotland, to help the refugees escape... there were several secret tunnels built under churches. That is known history. And his escape was very simple. He used an ancient wartime strategy like A Star algorithm... found the shortest exit route from the church... and escaped in a flash! Sir, I don't understand anything. Are you going to listen to this little girl's story... and use her college notebook to do your investigation? Anand, Interpol aren't idiots to come all this way blindly trusting some little girl's theory. Sir, that wasn't what I meant. In ML algorithm, there is a study called cloud of line distribution. It analyses the strokes of a person's handwriting... and accurately predicts which part of the world he is from. The guy who killed the Prince in Scotland... made an accurate forgery of the father's signature at the palace he was staying at. Upon analysing the signature, we found out he wasn't European. He is an Asian. To be more precise... we found of that the chances of him being an Indian is very high. That's when I came across Judy's thesis. And the Indian connection got me curious. The signature we found at Coimbatore yesterday... was in Tamil. When I analysed those strokes, it got confirmed... that he is an Indian. And a Tamilian. Wow, really? Why are you getting excited about this? Ma'am, he is a genius! I'm proud that he is one of us. Oh, god! Are you okay with helping us in this case? Don't you dare play too hard to get! What do you expect, ma'am? I've already told you that maths is the common factor. There must be one other connecting factor behind all these people who died. Either a common story. Or a common enemy. There must definitely be something. Maybe if they find out what that is... I can atleast do my bit to help stop the next assassination. But be assured, that's easier said than done. He is a cobra. The most intelligent among all the snakes. He knows how to change his appearance and shift from one form to another. He also knows to patiently hide and wait for his target... and strike within the blink of an eye. Let's see. Let's play this game. Tamil, I've proofed the Su-Do-Ku puzzle and sent it across. - Okay, sir. Get it printed. - Sure, sir. I scored the top marks in the mid term exams, sir. Hello, sir! Haven't seen you in a while. How are you? Thanks! Wow, what a style! Beautiful. You must see this. I'm talking to you! Why is your sister-in-law whistling through her nose? The entire family is inside. Be careful! We are unable to show face in town. How can you just leave and come here to live with some random guy? Imagine what people would say! They'd say I am living with him! What's your problem with accepting him? No matter what happens, I won't get you married to him. I need to use the computer. - Hello, sir... That system is free. Can you use that? Mathi asked you to top up this number for 129 rupees. Fine, I'll do it in the morning. Hello, sir? I just got the confirmation. Send his payment to those 50 charitable trusts. Okay, sir. Thank you. What is your daughter even saying? If she isn't interested in this marriage, why did you invite us? Brother, please... - No point talking anymore. Meena Sister, please listen to me. She is making up stuff just to spite us. None of what she says is true. Why are you still talking? Start fighting! Get the hell out of here! Let's leave. - Be quiet! Brother, please wait... - Go away, you devil. What kind of family is this? Cheers! Yeah, baby! The big boy has run helter-skelter-- Stop it, you brainless moron! What do you think of yourself? How dare you humiliate all of us for the sake of some random guy? Is he more important to you than us? Who is he? How can we get you married to him without knowing about his family and background? He is raising some random orphan boy, calling him 'little one'. He prays to the sketch of some random woman, referring to her as his mother. He hasn't said a thing about his family. How can we get you married to such a man? Don't run your mouth. - You shut up! If he was born into a good family and raised by a good mother... he wouldn't take an innocent girl home and make her family suffer. Just ignore what she says. No one born into a good family-- - Shut up! That's your limit. Don't run your mouth unnecessarily. If he wanted to, he could have already married me... made me cut ties with all of you, and live a happy married life. Instead, he valued all of you and insisted that we need your consent for the wedding. And look at how you treated him in return! Get out of my sight. I don't need any of you. He is the only person I need in my life. Get it? He is all I need. What's this, Bhavana? Mathi... Mathi, please don't take anything they said to heart. Please! Let me apologise on their behalf. I am the one who should apologise. I shouldn't have strung you along when I knew this will never happen. Why do you say this won't happen? Because they won't agree to it? Who are they to decide my life? You like me, and I like you. I don't like you, Bhavana. What are you saying, Mathi? I respect you and the social work you do. But that... - Are you saying that isn't love? You are lying, Mathi. I know how your face changes when you lie. I know what the smallest of movements in your eyes mean. What they said was wrong. Just tell me what I should do now. This won't happen. Listen to your family. Leave this house. - What are you saying? I won't leave, Mathi. Even if you say it a thousand times, I won't leave. I will continue to live here. I'd even give my life for you. Don't say that again and again, Bhavana! I don't want anyone to sacrifice their life for me. What should I say to make you leave? I told you several times not to stay here. But you never listened! I really don't like you. I don't want you. I don't want anyone else except you, Mathi. Without you, I don't know if I can... Will you atleast come to see me when I die someday? Atleast on that day, don't lie about not liking me... and whisper the truth into my ears atleast once, Mathi. I won't disturb you anymore. Bhavana... Bhavana, please stop. - Sister, please! Bhavana, listen to me. Very good! You did really well there! If this is your decision, you could have said it four years ago. Give me one reason why you don't like her. Should I say it? Jennifer. I love you. You are doing this because you are still thinking about her. This is wrong, Mathi. Very, very wrong. Yeah, next one? Hello, sir. What's the purpose of your trip? What's the purpose of your trip? Holiday. Oh, holiday? Enjoy your trip. I will. Sir, someone has hacked into all the servers to print these. Not just here, but all the floors in this building. This is going to be his next hit. How do you know? Has this happened before? Yes. It happened once previously. Same fashion. They hacked the Interpol servers, just like this. But... who is doing this? Either he is doing this himself to increase the thrill factor... or someone who wants him to get caught is doing this. But what does this mean? HKG I've seen this somewhere. James, is this Hong Kong? Yes, Chief. You are right. HKG is Hong Kong. What about LED then? St. Petersburg, Russia. He is travelling from Hong Kong to St. Petersburg to do something. Alert the Russian Intelligence. Make a list of all passengers who travelled from Hong Kong over the last week. But these numbers... there is some clue in it. Don't worry, Aslan. My mind's been at it for a while now. Give me sometime. I'll get this. James, I need details on all the important events scheduled to happen in St. Petersburg this week. Hello? This is Nawab speaking. The Interpol have tracked your man all the way to Russia. What the hell have you done? Idiots! Come to the hotel immediately. Sir, we received your mail. In fact, due to security reasons... we have cancelled all events in St. Petersburg for the next one week. Because the president is visiting here. The president is visiting the city? When? Day after tomorrow. The People's Front Party are hosting a big event here. The Russian President, his cabinet ministers, and several other international delegates will be here... to meet the party's supporters. Fish! Nellai, how did this information get leaked? I'm wondering too. Maybe it got leaked from your side... There is no chance of an information leak from my side. Tell him to come back. Your guy is going to get caught. If Rishi's name comes out... all of us will be in danger. This isn't some game, Nellaiappan. Come back? Once he gets started on a mission, I can't even reach him. Everything will go as per plan. Don't worry. Yes, Officer Aslan? I heard about the purpose of your visit. So, what are you saying? General, we have to stop this event. Because some important person could get killed in it. Who do you think that could be? I don't know. It could even be the president. Listen, officer... I understand your concerns. But this event is a matter of honour and prestige for our country. We can't cancel it under any circumstances. You believe some random hacker who says the Russian President will be killed on Russian soil? It is so laughable. This is Russia, officer. Our defence and security is much more powerful than you can imagine. What's going on? General, you've got to come out and see this. Someone has hacked our entire defence tower. Lazy fellows! How long does it take for you to come out? Tell them to shut the tower down. Hey, Aslan! - Shut the tower down immediately. This is a small gift from me. For you, my friend. Okay? Here you go. Your guy is going to get caught. Tell him to come back. If Rishi's name comes out... Listen carefully. - All of us will be in danger. Your guy is going to get caught. Tell him to come back. If Rishi's name comes out... Rishi... Rishi... Rishi... Rishi... Some guy is giving us all this information... but why isn't he revealing the identity of the assassin? Maybe he doesn't know how or under what guise the assassin would come. What if he is just sharing whatever information he has with us... because he wants to get the assassin caught? Rishi, Rishi, Rishi... Listen, listen... Listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen! Rajiv Rishi of Rishi Corporations. He is the connecting factor. Orissa's CM, the Prince of Scotland, the Mayor in France... all of them opposed Rishi and Rishi Corp one way or the other. So, who could his target in Russia be? It could be Dimitri Yugoslav. He is an important leader. Our country's Defence Minister. Yes, it is the Defence Minister. How do you know? It is simple maths. 4136P66 P is for point. So, 4136.66 The square is 17111955. 17-11-1955 Defence Minister's birthday. Defence Minister Dimitri is involved in an arms racket with Rishi Corp. The Defence Minister shut down Rishi Corp's operations in Russia to save himself. This has to be him. Officer Aslan, what do we do now? We can't cancel this event at any cost. At the same time, we have to stop this assassination too. The assassin will be stopped, General. I won't let him take one step forward! No matter what calculations your genius comes up with... He only plays with numbers. I will give him more numbers to play with this time. Good morning, St. Petersburg. We are outside the Presidential Palace. Thousands of supporters of the People's Party have gathered here. The President will be leaving shortly for the event with his top ministers. Nikolai, what are you gawking at? Hurry up! Right away! - Flash news... Roll it! Rolling... The Defence Ministry has made an important announcement just now. According to it, the venue of the event has been shifted due to security concerns. We've received information that the event will now happen at Paul Fortress. The Defence Ministry has requested all party members and supporters to gather at Paul Fortress. Okay? Okay, good. Could they have received any information? Who is that guy? Hang on. Paul Fortress. It's on a tiny island on Neva river. There is only one way to get there. I'm sure they must have locked and secured the entire area. What do you say? Are we doing it? Genius, are we doing it? Body double. They've played us with a body double while the real defence minister was here all along. Alright, get ready. So this will be our eyes. You sure we don't have any blind spots? No, sir. We have covered the venue from all sides. All cameras... are you guys ready? This game is about to end. Snipers, take positions. Alpha, ready. Delta, ready. Seize the place. Close all the exits. It's locked. Scanners... This was a trap for us. Our fingerprints won't match with the ones on the biometric scanner. We will get caught for sure. There is no way we can escape. What are we going to do now? It's very hard. Get the hell out of here. No chance! We must do something immediately. We are locked. See, looks like you are scared! You can't do it, can you? - But you can! Only you can do it! Think! Think! Think hard! Don't do it! Escape! Please listen to me. You will listen to me, won't you? Listen to me! Don't do this. Get out of here. Hold on! Where do you think you are going? Looks like someone finally beat you at numbers and boxed you in! You are a dead man today. We are losing time, genius. We are losing time! Stay focused. Your mind shouldn't be here. Your mind shouldn't be here. Notice every little detail. You will surely find a loophole. Go there! The security team is in an arrowhead formation. They will secure the minister in exactly 1.45 seconds reaction time. Everyone is saying different things-- He has found something! Disturbance! Ma, something smells really bad here. Let's leave, Ma. Ma, something smells really bad here. Let's leave, Ma. It's methane gas. The manholes in a sewer channel are generally connected. And yes, the next manhole is right next to the stage. We just need to set off a small spark in this manhole. We can blow up the entire stage. He's got it! He's got an idea! He's done it! Boom! Camera crew... is anyone on the line? Is anyone connected? Please reply. - Have we lost all the visuals? Not even one is active? - Sir, I think everyone is injured. We aren't receiving visuals from any of them. Sir, we are receiving visuals from camera 7. Camera 7, can you hear me? I need a visual of the minister. Do you copy? Do you copy? - Copy that. Sir, he can hear us. - Good. Ask camera 7 to keep moving forward. And get me the visual on the giant screen. - Yes, sir. Camera 7, go inside the tunnel. Get closer to the minister. I hadn't planned such a painful death for you. Sorry. Call the paramedics! It's an emergency. Where could he escape from here? Sir, he can't escape anywhere from this river. The water is so cold, no one can survive for more than 2 minutes. He will surely get caught. Sir, he isn't the actual press reporter from RT. Oh, damn! Officer, we've circulated his photo everywhere. We've informed all the airports and sea ports. There is no way he can escape. Here are your reports. Consult the doctor. - Okay, miss. Whatever it is, make it quick. Because I need to go home. I have a family of my own. I can't live a solitary life by shunning everyone around me. Kumaresan, if you want to go home, just go already. Don't annoy me. Why are you getting annoyed? We are the ones who should be annoyed by what you do! A girl trusted you and came home but you chased her away. Where did she go? Is she alive or dead? You don't care, do you? Not just you, none of us can see Bhavana again. In Sudan, they have a reform school in the desert... for children who get involved in guns, drugs, and terrorism. She's signed an agreement to serve there for 15 years. She is going to leave. Her flight is tomorrow. Mr. Mathiyazhagan... Seizures, hyperthermia. Did you go to any cold places in the recent past? Yes, doctor. He'd gone to Valparai to teach children, and got back only this morning. He's been complaining of bad chills and head aches since he got back. Seriously, Mr. Mathi? Does it get that cold in Valparai these days? Mathi, he is talking to you! Enlargement of ventricles. The cortical volume has reduced. Is there anything unusual about Mathi's behaviour in recent times? No, doctor. No such thing. Mathi, do you have any prior history of mental illness? Has anyone diagnosed you for schizophrenia? Or disorders like schizoid? I won't leave, Mathi. Even if you say it a thousand times, I won't leave. I will continue to live here. Mathi... Do you hear me? See, I just want you to be there for me. I can see you are really confused about something. I don't need anyone else except you, Mathi. I can do something only if you tell me what that is. Is there something else in your mind? I will know what it is only if you tell me. Have you had extreme depression or anxiety attacks in the past? Can you tell me about your past? You are doing this because of something from your past! To help you get over me... an angel will come to shower you with love and attention. I love you. Mathi... Do you hallucinate? Do you hear things that no one else does? Or see things no one else does? Do you hallucinate? He's got some plan! I'll take care of it. Sure, go ahead. Good night! Don't do it. You sure? Good, then. What happened, doctor? You mentioned hallucinations etc. Is it something serious? See, there are two categories of people who hallucinate. The first category can't tell apart what is real and what is not... so they get mentally affected and become very serious. But the other category can tell apart what is real and what is not. They are smart enough to accept it and learn to live with it. They might appear very normal too. I had to ask because I suspected that could be the case with him. Your guy is going to get caught. Tell him to come back. If Rishi's name comes out... Officer, before you start accusing our Capo... I'm sure your forensic analyst team verified Nawab's video. Can you tell me the date and time stamp on it? It was three days ago. At 10 pm IST. Perfect! These are Nawab's termination papers. We fired him exactly 74 days ago. There is no connection between Nawab and our Capo or Rishi Corporations. What Nawab was referring to in the video could be something completely unconnected, right? Look here, officer. Let's not beat around the bush. Our records are clean. We are ready to cooperate with you. If you still suspect Capo... arrest Nawab and conduct an enquiry... and declare to the whole world that our Capo is a good person. I will arrest Nawab if you tell me where you are hiding him. Sorry? Nawab went missing 10 minutes after we received the video. Tell me where he is. Why are you asking us? It's your job to find him! Are you playing a game with me? I'm almost there. I won't spare any of you. I am going to hold your Capo by his collar and drag him-- Excuse me, officer! It will be nice if you can maintain some decorum! You don't get to run your mouth because we treat you with respect. When the main witness goes missing in a case as big as this... I can understand how frustrated you must be. But don't you dare take it out on us. What you should do is deploy a big team for this... and search every country, every city, every street out there. Isn't that what you are paid for? It's the sweetest dish I've had in my entire life. I'm all yours, Capo. I'm missing you already. When a 22 year old punk gets all this money and power... I am just beginning to realise what his corrupt little brain can be capable of. Actually you are right, officer. My brain, my hands, my legs... and the lips that she just kissed are just 22 years old. But the blood that runs in my veins has been doing corporate business for 120 years. We know what to do and how to do it. Buzz off! Capo, no! Please, Capo. Don't... Please, no... I'll buy out the CBI and make you my employee! Capo, he is from the Interpol. What? - Yeah... Shit! That hurts, man. What have you done, Uncle? Random guys are coming and threatening me! Sorry, Rishi. I was very careful. But I don't know where and how it got leaked. Champagne, uncle? No thanks. Oh, come on. Who is this Nellaiappan? Since when have you had this link? About six years ago, you'd asked me to finish off an important witness in a jail in Ukraine. That wasn't an easy job. We got it done through Nellai's guy. Since then, we have been using only Nellaiappan and his guy to kill people. And who is this guy? I don't know. What? I don't know who he is. I tried to find out who he is several times. But I couldn't. Does that guy know about us? He does. Wow! That's so cool. So, who is this guy passing information to the Interpol? I don't know. You don't know anything! Uncle, do you remember what you always said? That you would be honest with me and the company. And that you'd do anything for us. So sweet! Uncle, you must be, what, 65 years old now? Oh yeah, we just celebrated your birthday! So you hardly have another 7-10 years left. Give up those 10 years for me, uncle. Rishi! Rishi, what are you saying? You're joking, right? No, uncle. I'm very serious! Now it's all gone beyond limits. This is the only way we can fix things, uncle. Please! It's just 10 years, uncle. Give it up! Rishi, don't hurt me. - Oh, no! I'll just go away somewhere. Please, Rishi... - Uncle, please don't beg me like this. Please, uncle. - Please don't hurt me, Rishi. Make sure he doesn't feel any pain. - I won't say a word to anyone. My dear uncle. Please, uncle. - Rishi, please spare me. Don't do it! - Rishi... No, no, no. Uncle, please. I'm already high and having a bad trip. Please don't do this, uncle. It makes me very uncomfortable. Uncle, this is feeling terrible. Just hold steady and be still, I'll finish it off quickly. Please, uncle! Oh, damn. I warned you, didn't I? I told you I was high and asked you to stay still! Nellaiappan, the assassin... and that freak who is giving tip offs from the outside... none of them should live. Just clean up everything. Every god-damn thing. Baby... the breeze is so cold, isn't it? I'll get us a cab. Stay right here. Listen... I'll get us a cab. Stay right here. Don't buy that newspaper. Do you realise what you are doing? Don't do this. You are killing random people for total strangers. They are using you. You are a good person. Only I know that. It's not fair to dwell on the past and make another woman suffer for it. You know I am saying this for your own good, don't you? This isn't the life for you. You should be with Bhavana. That is where your life lies. Let's leave all of this behind. Stop, don't do it. Listen to me. Think about everything we've lost to get the life we wanted. Please! See... you are shedding tears. This is who you are. Knowingly or unknowingly, don't make another mistake. Let's go and get Bhavana. Stop here. Mathi, wait! Where are you going? For the first time, I am in your place. I finally understand the pain. You said you'd never leave even if I tell you to. I just want to ask three questions. Then I'll leave. If I tell you we don't need anyone's permission... and ask you to come with me now... will you come with me or not? If I tell you that I won't let you down for a hundred years... will you come with me or not? If I tell you I will never ask you to leave even if my life depends on it... will you... come with me? Or not? She will come with you. If she doesn't, I will convince her.

She is not from criminology. She is a mathematician. She is working with the Interpol on a really big case at the moment. Oh... Nice! Are you wondering what's the connection between maths and crime?

Damn you, grandpa! I need to break his TV already! - Let me take care of it. [news] On account of the official visit of Japanese diplomats to Kolkata... an emergency council meeting has been scheduled under the leadership of DGP Ganguly. At the house of Hindustan Today's senior journalist Nellaiyappan in Kumurtali, Kolkata... three family members were found dead after they consumed poison and committed suicide. The police have setup a special team to search for the missing Nellaiyappan. They are also questioning people close to him. I know him very well. He didn't have any debts. He actually had a lot of savings. But now they are saying he's got no money in his account. Something is wrong. The police are cooking up some story to divert this case. The truth will come out only if we find Nellai Sir. I knew the Interpol guy was going to sniff everything out. And now he is nearing us. If it was the Interpol... they would have arrested him and gone down the legal route. But that's not what happened. Nellai is in some trouble. Oh, I see! Maybe that was what he was trying to say through the newspaper, Dad? Did we make a mistake? Do you have the Hindustan Today newspaper dated December 27th? You want a newspaper from two days ago? We don't keep it here. It's at the warehouse. Where is that? Take a left turn there. Hello, excuse me. The newspapers-- - Everything is in there. Hindustan... - In there. Go and take it for yourself. Does this mean he sent some details through this mail, Dad? No way! No chance at all. He knows we will never use mail or phones under any circumstances for safety reasons. Something is wrong. Maybe he was in a situation where the only option he had was to send a mail. No, this is not safe. Something is fishy! We have no idea what happened to Nellai. Three people are dead at his house. Are we still going to go on and on about safety... or are we going to try to find out what happened at his house? The shop shuts in 30 minutes. Hurry up. - Yeah, okay. Hello? Mic testing 1,2, 3. Do you recognise him? Your wonderful godfather! It looks like he is getting a nice massage, doesn't it? No! This is called Chinese water torture. When the water falls drop after drop after drop... it can even dent a rock, you know? So imagine, if it can deform a rock, what would happen to your old man's head? As time passes... every drop that falls on his head will feel like... boom! Boom! It will feel like thunder. His mind will be consumed with fear about the next drop that would fall on him. Boom! Slowly but surely... his brain's rhythm will break... and he will lose his consciousness! Then the old man will blurt everything out. Everything. Every single secret. Oh, I forgot to mention... other than you, the CBI are also watching this video as we speak. Who is this? Who sent this to us? Don't know, sir. An unknown ID shared this link. It's streaming on the dark web. Only those who know about this link can open it. Forward this link to me. Hey, don't worry! I won't rat you out so easily. This old man isn't going to speak up easily either. 5 seconds into 2 feet height... into 3600 seconds divided by 5... plus, plus what... plus this guy's age! I don't know how to calculate this. You are good at maths, aren't you? I think you only have about 30-31 hours. Before that, try to save this old man's life if you can... and save yourself too, okay? I don't know who you are. But I can see I am your target. You thought you were attacking me... but you've stepped into a quagmire instead. A quagmire named Rishi Corp. Thirty hours to go! You have no idea how dangerous he is. He will definitely-- What? Are you trying to scare me? You math head... your calculations won't work with me. I don't care about anything. Not even death. All I need is you. I want to watch you run for your life and die. Your countdown begins now. Run! I said, run! I just got a call saying they found our car at the airport. The groom isn't there. They said they'd talk to the airlines and find out which city he's gone to. He's left the city? What is this, Kumaresan? We are just two hours away from the wedding. The guests have started to come in. What is this, brother? Why can't I ever understand him? Things were going just fine. Did I say something wrong? Or do something wrong? Or did I just pester him into agreeing to this marriage? But, no. He was the one who came to me. No, I'm sure he went on some emergency. But is he safe? Can you please find out what happened to him? Why do you care what happens to him anymore? How can you say that, brother? You don't need him. He isn't right for you. I don't mean to say he is a bad person. He is just not able to accept you, Bhavana. Fifteen years ago... I met Mathi in Kolkata for the first time. He didn't know me back then. But the whole neighbourhood... knew him and Jennifer very well. Jennifer? Yes. Mathi was in love with Jennifer. Sincerely. I don't know who jinxed it. They said you are perfectly fine. Sign this statement which says you are fine and get going. Sir, my phone got lost somewhere. Let's talk about that later. This concerns the Commissioner's daughter. Sign now. But, sir... - Just sign it, man. Get his signature. Just sign it, kid. Sir... Sir! My leg... Doctor! Has he signed? - Yes, sir. Wait outside. Daddy, this is not fair. We should take care of his treatment. How can we just leave him like this? You shut up, Jenny. She hits some random guy on the road and insists on treating him at a big hospital! I should have thought about this before giving you the car. Discharge him and send him away, Indu. No, aunty. Please don't listen to him. Treat him, aunty. You say it's a serious fracture too. I'll pay you later. No, actually... Keep this, and please give the boy the treatment he needs. Jenny, what are you doing! You wear your mother's bracelet in memory of her. You'd never take this off for any reason. Who is that boy? Your boyfriend? Come on, aunty. Does he need to be my boyfriend or friend for me to extend support to him? Then what? Poor guy, aunty. It's been hours since he got injured. But not one person has come to see him yet. They told me he has nobody. If his mother was still around... she'd have panicked and rushed here to see if her son is doing okay. I kind of feel really bad for him. So please, don't overthink it. Just perform the operation he needs. Sure, but you should first-- - Keep it! After he wakes up, please give this to him. Okay, aunty? Bye. Jenny, take this back. Jenny! Chaitra, complete the formalities for the accident case... and prepare for surgery this evening. - Okay, doctor. Come on! Mathi, you are so... stupid? Did you have to use your phone while crossing the road, you fool? Imagine what would have happened if I had mowed you down! I should have done it. You know how much I love driving a car. Now because of you, they won't let me drive a car again. I will never forgive you for this. I heard you were my classma-- class-- Classmate? I should never see you for the next four years. Don't ever fall in my sight! I hate you. I hate you.

I swear on myself. Don't break the promise under any cost. Aslan, the man you are looking for is called Nellaiappan. He is a journalist. He's been missing for three days now. The video you saw in Russia was shot at the spa in Tulip Park Hotel. Nellai has gone to the hotel several times to use the spa. Nawab was in the hotel at the same time. But we don't have any CCTV footage... which shows both of them in the same room or that they even met at all. I've attached the snaps from the CCTV. So the hacker was right again. Nellai is our trump card. - Yes! Check for any calls, messages or transactions between them through some closed circle... Yes, we did a complete verification, just like you asked us to. There are no calls, messages, emails or transactions between Nellai and Nawab. But we found several calls made between Nellai and Nawab's personal driver, Yadav. What? Well, then get him under our custody immediately. Sir, we tried to contact him. But his number is not reachable. Great! Another missing link. Deploy a search team to find him. This guy knows something for sure! Hey, Yadav! Sir, please, sir. Let me go. Nice view, huh? You know what, Yadav? This is something important that humans can learn from rocket science. The further the rocket goes up... it will detach the empty fuel tanks one by one. You know why? Because it's dead weight, my friend! Unnecessary weight. When we don't need something anymore, we must let go of it immediately. And now, you look like dead weight to me, Yadav! Sir, please don't kill me. Then prove me wrong, man. What use are you to me? I saw him, sir. I saw him, sir. I saw him, sir. I saw him, sir. I went to Nellai's house but only his family was there. But he abducted Nellai... I saw the guy who abducted Nellai. I saw the guy who abducted Nellai. I have a photo of him. I have his photo. I have his photo, sir. I have a photo of him. Where? My phone. On my phone, sir. Sir... Hold still! Hold still... Where is it? - Gallery... It's the last photo in the gallery. Sir, it hurts so bad. Forward this to all our men. Tell them to search every single alley in Kolkata. Ten crores for the person who finds him. I need him. Sir, please let me go. It hurts so bad. Sir... Careful. - Okay... Hurry up. He is here. Hurry up. Have the forensic analysts examined the crime scene yet? No, sir. Not yet. They are on the way. Sir, these two girls are Nellai's daughters. Both of them are doing their higher education in the US. Can an ordinary press reporter give education to his daughters in the US? Is it possible? Not possible, sir. How many did you say are there in Nellai's family? Six members in total. Him, his wife... his mother, his mother-in-law... And two girls. That's him. His wife. His mother. His mother-in-law. His two daughters. Then who is this boy? No, that isn't his son. Fifteen years ago, that kid used to come to his house regularly. He doesn't come here these days. Ask him if he knows where their house is. Go straight, take a left at the bus stand... and ask around for Alipur Home. Be careful. Don't spread my legs. The stitches might give away! Why are you carrying me like a worthless sack of onions? Careful! Sir... Just take a good close look and tell us who he is. I am long sighted. Move it away from me. Oh, him... Do you know him? Yes... It's Mathiyazhagan. Dinesh, don't run! Hello, madam... - What? Stay here. No one is allowed inside. But I'm also a part of the team. Ask Aslan. No, madam. I'm sorry. Stay here. Anand, he is a prime witness. Move him to our office immediately. Okay, sir. Hey, Judy. When did you come? Why didn't you come in? They didn't let me inside. - Sir, Yadav is dead. What? - Yes, sir. They shot him dead at a construction site. His body is shattered. We've sent it for post-mortem. We need to hurry. Anand, go to the hospital immediately and collect his autopsy reports. No one else should get hold of it. No, sir. Let me come with you. We can send Vishnu... Anand, please understand. I can't trust anyone else with this. I can only trust you. Please go. Judy, let's go. Come. Where are we going? I think I've unearthed the origins of your genius. He is right here. He is following us. Where are you now? Howrah Station. Don't tell anyone else. Come to the market area. Let's box him in. Okay. Turn left. Go to the fish market. Brother, take left. Mathiyazhagan! I know him very well. He is not a student one forgets so easily. He was a star! A genius. The first state rank holder from our school. We can never forget him! Sister, this genius of yours... how good was he at maths? Extraordinary! He could solve 12th grade math problems when he was in grade 5! He's asked me several times why the school wouldn't teach more advanced maths. The school sponsored him to attend Olympiads and conferences at several countries. But you know what? He was not just good at maths. He was equally good with computers. When the other kids used to play games on the computer... even at that young age, he used to design advanced computer games. Fifteen hours to go! Fifteen hours to go! Fifteen hours to go! I've entered the fish market. We are here too. Cover the left side. Get all our guys on a conference call. - Okay, boss. Yes, brother? - Hello? Hello? Where are you? Where is he? He is right behind me. Go this side and look for him. You, go there. He shouldn't escape. Search the entire market. You think you can beat me up and escape from here? There are thousands of men like me looking for you in Kolkata. You can't even leave this area! Who are you people? What did you say about me over the phone? I showed your photo on the phone and said... the guy who kidnapped Nellai is right here! You think you can continue to live after antagonizing Rishi? Just hand Nellai over to us... and apologize to Rishi and save your life. I saw him. I just saw him. I saw the guy in the photo. Are you sure it was him? It was him! He ran into the tram godown. Come to the tram godown. It's the guy from the photo for sure! Everyone, come to the tram godown. Please try to understand. Aslan, this isn't about maths or scoring 100 in the exams! We are talking about being a prodigy in two completely different fields. Like, totally genius in it. This isn't even possible! Just think about it. This guy has hacked the servers at the Interpol Headquarters and the CBI. He must be a genius with computers. But Cobra is a mathematician for sure! What if they are two different people? And maybe there is some rift between them? Shut the gates! Lock all the doors. I saw him at the tram godown, but can't find him now. We are looking. He is near the last tram, running away. Come to the last tram. Answer the phone. I said, answer the phone. Just do as I say. No matter what happens here, you can leave this place alive. Why are these people chasing me? Who are they? - He is right here. He is on the phone with someone. Look for him. Hello, answer me! Just listen to me! Why should I listen to you? Who are you to me? Just listen to me! Take the right and get out of here. He ran into the market. Everyone, go into the market. Buy an umbrella from the shop ahead of you. What for? Just buy it! How much? - 100 rupees. He is buying an umbrella here. Box him in from all sides. Let's see how he escapes from here! Did anyone see the colour of his umbrella? He has a yellow umbrella with blue stripes. I saw him! Don't stop. Keep walking until I say so. Tell me atleast now! Who are these people? Why are they after me? Can any of you understand anything they are saying? Tell me... Who are these guys? They are the goons of this guy called Rishi. Oh, Rishi? Has he found me? Do you know Rishi? Answer me! You know Rishi? He is on the left side, near the paan shop. He is getting away! This isn't him! See if you can spot the same colour umbrella elsewhere. We couldn't find a similar umbrella anywhere else. How did you get this umbrella? Answer me! Some guy gave his umbrella to me... and took mine... What colour umbrella did you have? It's a red umbrella. It's a red umbrella. Look for a red umbrella! Why did you ask me to swap umbrellas? Who are you? Just answer my questions. Why should Rishi send men to kill you? What's your rift with Rishi? He doesn't have an option. If he doesn't find me and Nellai, who I've got with me, within the next 14 hours... Rishi and his entire empire will go down the ground. You've got Nellai with you? Capo, they got him! Yes, tell me? Sir, we trapped him inside the market. But someone is coming up with ideas to save him. I think they are partners. I don't care if it's two of them or two thousand. I need him alive. Get it? I need him alive. Go back and tell your boss... tell Rishi that his time is up. No one can silence Nellai now. No, don't talk to him! Who the hell are you to call time on Rishi Sir? Let me see how you get out of this market! Tell him to add me to the conference call. You are making a mistake. Keeping Nellai with you is like signing your own death warrant! Try to understand. Tell me where he is. I'll make sure he doesn't lay a finger on you. Dude, seriously? Do I look like someone who is scared of these guys? No matter what happens, I won't reveal Nellai's location. Listen to me! Shut up and listen to me, Mathi! Mathi... The name of the hacker who kidnapped Nellai is... Mathi. Oh, that? He was a loafer, just like me. But after he met a girl called Jenny, he eloped with her. Jenny? Yes, Jenny. Her family didn't agree to it. But her family didn't accept him. She was the Commissioner's daughter. They even tried beating him up. And one fine day, I heard a loud thud. It was an accident. We heard the girl had died in it. I heard you are scary good at maths! Mathi Sir... Just wait and watch... when you have a problem... he will be there for you. Sir, I beg you. Please don't separate my sons. Listen to me, lady. The government will put Mathi up in a good orphanage. But we have to send this mad boy to a psychiatric hospital. Sir, please don't call him mad. We don't have the time for this! Take the mad boy to the hospital tomorrow. Don't call him mad! Don't call him mad! He has a name. Kathir! Ma... I'll kick you so hard! You think you are some big shot because you bombed some cops to death? Lucky for you... Your mercy petition got rejected, and you are going to be hanged tomorrow. Or we'd have beaten you to a painful death inside your cell. Sir, he is crossing the limits. The whole world knows what the police do to the women in their village. Are all of you police ganging up and labelling this perfectly normal boy as crazy... to get back at this woman? Perfectly normal boy? Look at him! He's gone up the tower and scribbled all over the walls. When we ask him a question, he just does this. He talks to himself. What else do we call him, if not mad? Sir, I am Kathir's maths teacher. He is a born prodigy. A genius. His IQ is much higher than other kids of his age. Please don't call him mad, sir. Ma, I don't want him. I can't stand watching you getting beaten up. Let him get lost somewhere. Let him go! What will he do without you? Just wait and watch... when you have a problem... he will be there for you. He just doesn't know how to express his love. I hope you aren't angry with me. I didn't say that on purpose. I said it out of anger because they hit Ma. I know, Mathi. How could you ever hate me? We share the same blood. I will never be angry with you, little one. Look there, Ma! Even now, he is talking to himself. How will he ever be there for me? Ma, please ask them to hang me right next to you. Let me come with you. Oh, no. You shouldn't say such things, Mathi. Both of you should be here. Both of you will study well and grow up to become well respected by everyone. Put that witch in there. She is not some freedom fighter to deserve a 21-gun salute! Cover her with mud. Everything is over. Sit! Are they going to hang me too? I am so scared, Kathir! So scared. I will never let anything happen to you, little one. You will live. And just like Ma wanted, you will live a good life. Listen to me. It wasn't you who committed the murder. It was me. Mathi didn't kill. It was Kathir. No matter how the police question you, just say... "It was Kathir who killed him but I don't know where he has gone." You've denied him food and water for 20 days under the pretence of an interrogation! Mathi isn't going to make it. He refuses to tell us where his brother Kathir is. Doctor, give us a certificate that he is critical due to food poisoning. We will take care of the rest. What nonsense! Are you even human? I'll do anything you ask me for life. I need the money now. Nothing should happen to my brother. - Kathir! Nothing should happen to my brother. - Kathir! The police will put you up in an orphanage soon. Another new ticket, huh? I wonder what antics he did to end up here! After that I will come and be there with you. As Mathi. This is the best place for us to hide. If someone comes into this room, one of us can hide here. Both of us will live under the name of Mathi. This is Kathir - the sun. Me. And that is Mathi - the moon. You. Monday is your day. You can step out. The next day I will step out as Mathi. Let the world never know what happened to Kathir. No one else should ever know about this. Swear on me. Don't you ever break the promise. No, Kathir. Please listen to me. Kathir, don't go. - Don't break the promise. How dare you loiter around in the jail? How dare you go after the Commissioner's daughter? A girl child is a family's property. A matter of honour. We can't let her go astray and watch like bystanders. I'll kill you! Die! I heard you have an older brother called Kathir? Who looks exactly like you? Ten years ago, he killed a cop and escaped, right? Did you ever see him again? Did you? The case is still open... I've asked them to dust the case file and look into it. You might need to come to the station often for an enquiry. Be prepared. Mathi, I am really sorry. Did they beat you up real bad? I swear, I won't spare them. Sorry, Mathi. Let's not blow this out of proportion. I was only being friendly with you, but they misunderstood that. I can understand your parents' fear. Let's not meet again or talk to each other. I am serious. Let's not meet again or talk to each other. You don't get to say that. Tell him to say that to me. I don't get it. You don't get to say that, Kathir. Tell Mathi to meet me and say that to me. He broke it! He broke it! He broke your promise into a million little pieces. You are the first hero in the world to save the villain's life! Mathi, what the hell have you done? They called me to the commissioner's house... gave me your photo, and asked me to kill you! You are caught up in something huge! They are not ordinary people. Even if not for me, they will use someone else to kill you. Please be honest with me and tell me the truth.... If you don't, things would turn tragic. Mathi! Mathi! Mathi, I'm talking to you... This isn't enough. Get some more cotton and tincture. Okay, go and take care of Mathi. What happened to Mathi? Jennifer's brother beat up Mathi with some men. What are you saying! Thanks, you guys should go. I can take care of myself. - Come on! How? I'm fine. I can take care of myself. Go. We are right here. Let us know if you need something. Okay. Careful! Did they hit you, little one? I'm sorry, Kathir. Why are you saying sorry, little one? It was a mistake. They thought you were me... Did they say anything else? Her father dug up our old case details. Oh? Is he threatening us? What did he say? That he'd put me on a noose? They can never separate us, no matter how hard they try. Little one, have you thought this through? Do you really need the girl after all of this? You don't need her. Kathir, this isn't just some girl. She is my angel. Not everyone ends up with an angel. Have you ever seen me smile in all these years? But I smile these days. I finally know what happiness means. I feel like I've regained everything I lost in life. I feel like I've got Ma back. Not everyone can become Ma, little one. The girl doesn't have patience. Do you know what she told her father? She will lead us to big trouble, little one. Are you scared? Are you scared our secret will be exposed and we'd get caught? I won't get you into trouble. I am going to leave the city with her in a few days. You can be Mathi all the time. Are you going to leave me, little one? Has she become more important to you than me? Fine... Where will you go? Those aren't ordinary guys. They will hunt you down and kill you. I just want to be with my Jenny. I am ready to sacrifice my life for it. You'd sacrifice your life for her? As long as I am alive, I won't allow a single scratch on your body. I'd go to any extent to protect you. If killing the girl is what it would take to save you... I am ready for that too. If you dare say another word... I'd put an end to you. You'd kill her? If you even think about it again... I'll kill you. Jenny? - Mathi... Mathi... - Jenny? Someone is chasing me. - What are you saying? They are chasing me. Mathi... - Who? Where are you? Who? Jenny... Kathir! Jenny? What? Jenny? Jenny... Jenny! Mathi... Mathi... Mathi... Mathi! Mathi, I am scared. You should-- Mathi... Mathi, please hear me out. Mathi... - Who is Mathi? Me? But you are Mathi, aren't you? Isn't that why you killed her? Are you puzzled how I made it out alive... after you threw me into the ship to rot with the filth in the ocean? I am destined to be the reason why you get caught and eventually die. That's why God saved me. The ship that you threw me in... it crossed borders and got caught by the Thailand coast guards. I was in jail for 10 years. It was hell. I escaped from the jail in Thailand. I was scared to go anywhere. I was scared that someone would identify me. But above all... I was filled with rage to find you after you escaped from Kolkata without leaving any trail behind. I installed cameras in all the places frequented by Nellai. I tapped his phone. I watched every single move of his and passed that information to Interpol. I was hoping atleast they'd be able to catch you... but you always got away. I went mad trying to crack your Su-Do-Ku code. Then I kidnapped Nellai. And I used him to send you the Su-Do-Ku code I wanted. You walked right into it, like a rat into a trap! That moment... I was so happy. When I admitted you here, they asked for your details. I said I didn't know. They said they'd have to inform the police, as per procedure. I said okay. I heard the police know the assassin who killed people across the world is you... I mean the police know it's Mathi, and they are looking for you everywhere to arrest you. No, Mathi. Listen to me... You wanted to be Mathi, didn't you? So be Mathi! No, Mathi. Sir, the accused we were looking for is in the hospital. I'll arrest him and bring him immediately. Sir, we have arrested him. We will reach in half an hour. There is no need for additional forces, sir. Don't worry, sir. We are on our way. How did the press get here? Hello, sir? I've sent you a photo. Please take a look immediately. His name is Mathiyazhagan. He is a maths teacher. I've been following Aslan's investigation thoroughly. I am 100 percent sure he is the assassin who worked for you. Show him the photo we got from Yadav. They are not just two people. They are two identical looking people. I don't care who Mathiyazhagan is. I don't want Aslan to investigate him. I'm coming over. - Sir, let me take care of it! I'll try to somehow shift him out of this case by tonight. I'll keep you informed. Anand... If something goes wrong... I will make sure there is no evidence of a person called Anand having existed on this earth. Sir, I assure you he won't open his mouth. I'll take care of it. But I need you to talk to the Home Minister to grant me full control of this case. I'll take care of it. I'll call you back. Lift him up! Thought you could mess with us? What do you mean 'duty'? - Answer me, sir. Sister... There is no way anything they said is true at all. Let me go. I'll come back with him. I don't find it right, general. I've been observing certain things here. The evidences were tampered. And I am damn sure Rishi is behind this. We need to get the custody of Mathiyazhagan as soon as possible. Or all our hard work will go to waste. Thought you could mess with us? Ma'am... You've made a mistake, Judy. A big big mistake. No, ma'am. I've done you a favour. I might be a big fan of his mathematics. But what he committed was a big crime. He will never be able to get away with it. Think about it, ma'am... I've done you a favour. Ma'am... I'm not hitting you to get you to talk. I am hitting you so you never talk at all. If you open your mouth... the guy outside who looks exactly like you... he will die in a more brutal way than you can ever imagine. Rishi is watching everything. What? Do you understand? How dare you laugh! Don't mess with me, you rascal! Do you even call this an investigation? What are you even doing? You will have to handover the suspect to me within three days. If something happens to him, I'll take this to the international court. Vishnu... Tell Anand to come here. - Sure, sir. Anand, stop this. Lower him immediately. What? Why should I stop questioning him? If you want him to talk within a day, this is the only way. Is that so, sir? By gagging him? You expect him to talk through his ears? Anand, I can definitely sense something wrong with you. Oh? Nice! Stop it! Bring him down and get him to the interrogation room. You haven't even allowed me to use the bathroom, like I'm some criminal. This is torture, sir. We got engaged yesterday. - You live with him, right? We were supposed to get married today. Why didn't the wedding happen? I have already answered that. You need to answer it every time we ask you, madam. I will answer if you ask me respectfully. Just answer the damn question! You were about to marry a criminal without knowing his background.... you don't deserve any respect! Why should he raise someone like you, who was born to a ganja peddler and an immoral woman? Cut the act and stop crying. Answer me. You live in the house, don't you? - Please let me go. What would be running inside that genius brain of his? Your time is running out way too fast. Things are going to get even worse for you. What wrong did they do? Why should they suffer? What is wrong with you? What the hell is wrong with you? He is the real problem. This little punk is our problem. Blood is thicker than water. That's the real matter. Emotion. Affection. Gopal... Lose it, man. Lose it. Get lost, you loser! Emotions have no value. They are neither scalar nor vector nor can be measured! The only difference between a genius and a fool is... emotional decisions. Teacher, it doesn't matter if you talk in length in a husky voice... or if you swear at him! Nothing will get past his thick skull! There he goes again! Yes, that is how my son is. I raised him that way. If Mathi is in trouble, he will be there for him. All of you have changed him. Oh yes, we changed him. It was us, we changed him! We changed him, we changed him, we changed him. We changed him, we changed him, we changed him. What the hell! Why are you feeling sorry for her? She is responsible for everything that happened to you. She deserved to die. It is not your fault that she died. Grab the stick! Oh, yes. It wasn't his fault. Then why is she chasing him? Why is she taking revenge on him? Exactly the point! He is being a showoff, My Lord! Kill him! You can do it. Even at this moment... you are a freaking genius with numbers in every goddamn cell of your body. Who? If you speak up and confess, we can atleast save them. Are you going to speak up or not? How much longer are you going to remain silent? What do we look like to you? You look like losers! Go for it, Kathir! You know what they'd do to Mathi if they catch him. Rishi will kill Mathi anyway. What's the point if both Mathi and you die? You know how to save yourself with minimal loss. Game theory! Just apply it! To hell with your apples. Go away, he isn't going to listen to you. You shut up! Kathir, please listen to me. Mathematics is not for fools like you. Don't keep saying the same thing. He isn't going to listen to you. Just shut the crap. Shut up, man. Shut up, man Won't you listen to me? - Genius... Be quiet, all of you. Not a word of what he says should go into your brain. This is absolute shit! Shut up and listen to me. Open your mouth and speak up! We know you did all of it. Just confess. You are asking me to confess to someone else's crimes, sir! Wait, what are you saying? Aren't you Mathi? The maths teacher? Sir, I am Mathi. I am the maths teacher too. But I didn't do it. I have absolutely nothing to do with any of this! I have an older brother, sir. Kathir. What's this new story? Sir, look up the Kolkata Jail records from 1985. Check the jail records. Verify it immediately and get back to me. Quick! Sir, there are two of them. Kathirvelan and Mathiyazhagan. The official reports are on their way, sir. I am just an average student, sir. But he is a genius. He is very different, sir. He doesn't talk to anyone, sir. In 1992, Dr. Sheetal was the juvenile doctor. Dr. Sheetal knows. She knows him very well. That psycho... Hurry up. - Okay, sir. Kathir? I remember. He was a special child. A maths prodigy. During our mother's final rites, an inspector behaved so disrespectfully. Debashish Chatterjee. He killed him on the spot. Killed him! This guy called Nellai... Even though I was a total stranger, he wanted to educate me. So I happily listened to everything he said and started attending school. After a few months I got to know that him and Kathir were doing some illegal activities. And that they were using me as a cover in case things went wrong during their illegal activities. He came to see me at the hospital last night. That was when I found out that he's dragged me into this big mess. I am just an ordinary maths teacher. Sir! Sir, I'm just an ordinary maths teacher. Sir, I have nothing to do with any of this. Sir, please... Brother! Hello? Sir... Sir, what do we do now? - He is not our problem, Anand. It's the hacker on the outside who is our problem. Stop! So he is the guy who was helping us all along. The guy who tied Mathi up and made him surrender to the police. But no worries. We don't have to do anything. The math guy would have done the math by now. Sir, how do you know that? Do you still not get it? He plugged all the loopholes and erased his name everywhere. The guy you mentioned does exist. But only in records. His only complication right now is that Nellai shouldn't blurt the truth out. He knows the clock is ticking too. This guy and Nellai are very important for us to close this case. We should make sure things don't escalate and no one ends up harming him. Just talk to him like I told you to. You know him really well. We can trap him only with you. If you help us, we won't disturb you. He won't be alive to disturb you either. This is your only option. He will lead us to the clown guy. I will help you, sir. Just do as I say. He will surely fall for it. But promise me that no harm will befall me or my family. I'll kill both of them together. Circulate this photo to all police stations, railway stations, toll gates, bus stands etc. Mainly West Kolkata... tell them to conduct a thorough search around the tram godown area. What if he doesn't step out? He shouldn't step out. Even if he does, he should return because he can't go anywhere. Because we can trap him only inside his own place. I don't get it. I'm saying it is very easy to find out where he's been hiding all these days. How is that? By his power and internet consumption. Hacking into Russia's Defence headquarters is no ordinary feat. It requires a lot of data centres and servers. It uses a lot of electricity and data. The Russian hack happened on Dec 27th, at exactly 7:40 in the evening. The time in India was 10:10 pm. If we make a list of the top 200 locations that consumed maximum power and internet during that date and time... finding his location will be... really easy. You can go. It's him! Catch him. Hurry up! Sir, there are 29 locations that are common across these two lists. Out of which 28 are IT parks, and the other one is a mall. A mall? Which mall? - Howrah Grand Mall. Howrah Grand Mall? But hasn't it been under renovation for the last 1.5 years? Moreover, they don't have permission to do renovation work during the nights. Did you check properly? - We did a thorough check, sir. Which area is the mall in? Sir, I think we need backup. We should call for our forces and bring this area under our control. They have already brought this area under control, sir. What are you saying? Didn't you notice the fresh tyre marks outside, sir? Based on the turning radius, I'd say 1 sedan, 3 SUVs, and 2 trucks. Some 20-25 men have already got here before us, sir. You think they wouldn't have brought the area under control, sir? Wow, wow, wow! Didn't I tell you our guy is really talented? Who are you guys? You are pointing the gun at the wrong guy, officer. Two more seconds and I'm going to get seriously offended. Sir, call for backup. - Drop the gun, Mr. Vishnu. Sir, call for backup. Please drop your gun, Vishnu! Sir... Kathirvelan! My best weapon. I should actually be thanking you. But thanks to what you did... you've put me in a situation where I have to kill both of you. All I can say now is... sorry. Sir... you don't have to say sorry to me! You won't kill me, sir. You can't kill me. Oh, yeah? Yes, sir. I feel like... I might end up harming you. Anand... relax! Anand... relax! Sir, do you know what an angel number is? 1111, 2222... When we see such numbers, anything we wish for will come true. You've done a lot for me, sir. Make one final wish, sir. In exactly 1-1-1-1-, that is 11 minutes and 11 seconds... you... and all these guys too... will be killed by me! Do you have any idea what you are saying? Do you get it, sir? I do, sir. This is fun. So, 1-1-1-1. 11 minutes and 11 seconds? Let's play this game. Let's see who wins. You or me? You are making a big mistake, officer. He is a prime suspect, goddamn it. Just tell me where the hell he is. Seriously? Fine, I will be waiting right here. If you don't hand him over to me within the next two hours... I promise you there will be severe consequences. Aslan... it was me who gave you those tipoffs all along. I don't know if I'd still be alive in some time. The only way you can close your case is with Nellai's statement. He will start blurting everything out in exactly 30 minutes. Kathir, Rishi, and all his men are right here. Get here as fast as you can. I've shared the location. This is my last favour to you. Don't spare him. Mathi... Did we catch both the rats in a single trap? Mathi... What are you guys doing in there? Come out! Come at me! Come on, guys! You've only got three more minutes. Fine! Okay... You've done a lot for me. It's just three more minutes. I will wait here. Did you hear that? Heard that? You are the reason for all of this! I am happy to die at your hands. I swear... I didn't kill her. I swear... I was the one who called Jennifer. Hear me out. The problem has become serious. Both of you need to get out of here immediately. I've made all the arrangements for you to go to Bangladesh safely. No one will be able to find you. He is furious with me. I don't even know if he'd believe me. I just want him to be safe. Nothing else. I hope no one saw you. I just told my little sister. I don't even know if I'd ever see her again. She has no one but for me. Mathi! Mathi... Jenny... Why are you crying now? Rather than being alive and tarnishing our family honour... I am glad she died. Report this as an accident and close the case! And throw this mongrel's corpse with other filth into the sea. I couldn't do anything so I was... filled with anger and rage. The people who killed you were... happy... I couldn't take it, little one. I didn't spare any of them. Not a single one. To my heart's content, I went after them. Ever since I heard what happened to you... There is a beautiful life waiting for you out there. Mathi... is a good teacher. Everyone likes him. Remember what Ma told us? It's such a good life. What are you saying, Kathir? It's called game theory, man. A mathematician knows how to get away with minimal loss. That is... instead of losing two lives, you are trying to save atleast one... so you are taking revenge! That's superb. First class! Sorry. Kathir... Who were you-- Oh... You don't know that, do you? Even as a kid, I had headaches. It felt like a machine was running inside my head. It hurt so bad. These people used to come to me. And offer me a lot of advice. You used to come, too. You used to smile when you talked to me. This is called a hallucination. They say it can be cured with treatment. This was the only way I could talk to you. But without it... how would I survive? So I didn't undergo treatment. Time's up! Please wait. Aslan will be here shortly, he will take care of everything. Kathir, don't... If you step out of the door, you won't survive. If something happens to you... I can't get away with the crimes I've committed. Rishi will never let us live as long as he is around. One person should take all the blame. You are Mathi now. Continue being Mathi. Shoot him! Shoot him! Attaboy! Let's leave. Shoot him! Shoot him! Come on! Shoot him! Shoot him! Shoot him! Yeah! My little brother... poor guy. It was me... but he... Nothing should happen to him. I don't care what happens to me. Look what I've done to his life... He... He should live. Sorry. Thank you, Mathi. I might be Mathi. When everyone calls me now... I might hear the name 'Mathi' millions of times. But the only name that will be running in my mind is... Kathir. Kathir! Kathir... Kathir, no matter where you are, I know you are watching over me. I know if I am in trouble, you will be there for me. I know you'd do anything for me. Can you do one last thing for me? If there is a next life... will you be my sibling again, Kathir? Please?
