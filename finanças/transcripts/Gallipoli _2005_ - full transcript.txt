Guy Nightingale was a son of the British Empire. He was a noble, born and raised in Britain. He attended Military School and then joined his regiment. Much like other officers of his time After passing through Dardanelles, they have no idea what to do. Only the assumption that the Turks will surrender immediately. Everyone hoped and counted on this. The British boats will impress and scare Turks so much that when the fleet enters Istanbul Turks will surrender immediately. That's the British plan. You see from their letters it was very simple to them. To help Britain, to protect the British Empire they volunteered to get into the army. This decision was not taken through intense consideration. In this aspect, they are no different than all the other thousands of Australians. The Turkish guns are nowhere near running out of ammunition. The British and French can attack twice more or they haven't got any ships left. I don't think they really sat down and thought about it. The problem was the immediate problem of landing an army. Where that army would go how it would fight that was tomorrow's problem. about what any troops will do when they're fighting for their homeland. they landed on a front of about 600-800 meters which caused a tremendous complexity on the shore. The boats and the troops got mixed, all of a sudden. and remain unscathed that day. He was a genius in that he could reduce the problems And what he thought of on that first day was onto the point: "Whatever they may cost us We can't lose the cliffs. We must do whatever we can to prevent the Australians from controlling the cliffs." The planning and commanding for the Second Battle of Krithia was dreadful for the British side. The goals were ludicrously overambitious. The strategy took no attention of the number and the state of troops and was ridiculous. And it completely underestimated the Turkish troops and defenses. The British did not have sufficient materials to fight both on the Western Front and at Gallipoli. They needed to choose one or the other and implicitly, they chose the Western Front. The Western Front got the lion's share of the men and the munitions. So Gallipoli was always second best. The government was not united in terms of purpose. And you can't win any war without unity. This is people whose insides are almost coming out. This is people who have to go to the latrines 10, 12, 14, 16 times a day. This is people whose backsides are red raw. Without toilet paper. They wipe their backside with their hands and then look for some grass to wipe their hands with. That didn't stop the dysentery. Under these conditions, dysentery became an endemic. And you could walk from the ANZAC trench to the Turkish trench and not touch the ground. Because there were dead bodies everywhere. They'd seen him at close hand. Some had even shaken hands. An interesting mutual respect grew The ANZAC began to call Turks "Jacko" or "Johnny Turk". Both sides continued to fight and kill each other but with a little more respect. After armistice, the letters of the Australians stated: "Whatever you may think about the Turk, he's a gentleman." There was a strange sort of honor, from that moment on. All the nationalities suffered very heavy casualties. Whether it was British, Indian, French, Ottoman Turks all had huge losses. The bodies began to pile up. The trenches began to smell with the decomposition. Seddülbahir was a horrible place. For the Turks, these battles on two flanks were the bloodiest and costliest of all the battles in Dardanelles. The Turkish losses here, the lives lost certainly account for the majority of losses out of total during the battles on Dardanelles. The flies went from the feces in the drains to the food. The flies came from the mouths and the open wounds of the dead to the food, into their mouths. And the flies spread disease. We know they had very little equipment. We know they had very little in the way of clothing. A lot of clothing got swapped round. Some men didn't have boots they literally had bandages on their feet. Even the horses were in poor condition. But, strange as it seems the morale of the Turkish army was very good. were close enough for both sides to often see each other. Somehow, they got to know each other. The Turk was not a shadowy figure on the eyes of the ANZAC. The Turks got to know the ANZAC, and the ANZAC got to know the Turks. Messages were even exchanged. Gifts were even exchanged. Turkish soldiers threw cigarettes to the Australians. The Australians threw bully beef back. It was returned after it was opened and tried. These men had seen terrible things, and did terrible things and will do terrible things because they believe in their cause they'll take away from this experience terrible scars, but they'll never, ever have lost their humanity. There's several cases of Turks and Australians bayoneting each other and literally both dying at the same time so that they were, if you like, totally linked in death and just lying there, impossible to separate. When the Australians went on to France and Belgium on the Western Front they often compared battles to the one in Kanlısırt. In their letters, they wrote either "It was as bad as Kanlısırt" or "It was nearly as bad as Kanlısırt." Before this had happened, a Turkish officer came to the end of one trench above the Australians and called out "Stop! Stop!" The slaughter had become too terrible. One of the things that always haunts me when I go there is why those men in the third and fourth line left the trench. What were they thinking? Despite knowing that they were going to achieve nothing and were going to die why did they leave? All through that day, they exhausted each other and it was as bloody as the Somme and Passchendaele. More intense, even because it's such a tiny piece of ground. And at the end of the day the Turks as well as the New Zealanders were exhausted. because people don't seem to have grasped the success of four Turkish battalions. The way they held the outposts. As the British neared, they kept hitting and running. It caused heavy casualties. And then evaporated into the night and the bushes. Mustafa Kemal was destined to be. He knew what he had to do and very well knew the price he had to pay. He didn't hesitate and abandon his command. And he succeeded. Gallipoli was the battle where a group of amateur soldiers faced the realities of war for the first time. And there was nothing glorious about it. It was mistake, blunder, muddle, death, and disease.
