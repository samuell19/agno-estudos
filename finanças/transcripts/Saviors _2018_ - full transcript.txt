They all think we're good people. Sure, we question it sometimes but isn't it funny how we always come to the same conclusion? I'm not perfect but all things considered I am good. Some of us even imagine that we're anointed by the universe for some greater purpose. Truth is we're prisoners in bodies we hate, in minds we can't escape, evolved to suffer until we give up on the fantasy of what we could've been. We're like pool balls, huddling together until hit by forces outside of our control. A series of ricochets as we crash into one another, locked in a clumsy, predictable existence with no way out. Unless we take control. Get away, get away, get away from this gentleman. I would get out of here, sir. What are you doing here today? Yes, we came here today to march peacefully and non-violently for the rights of white Americans, getting the message out that white lives matter and we came here in peace, we came here to march non-violently and we were attacked by an angry mob. Several of us were injured, we did not retaliate. Our only goal was to exercise our First Amendment rights and get the message out that white lives matter and that white Americans are being marginalized by the system in place and their voices are being drowned out and we need to be heard just like everyone else. I hate it when you make me wait. I hate it when you make me wait. I hate it when you make me wait. I love the sound of your voice. Sing something for me, baby. Come on, a little Celine, a little Whitney. I don't think this is the time for Celine. Really, what do you think it's time for? Let me see you, baby. Such a pretty girl. Do you remember when you played Out of Line, your junior year of school, your voice brought everyone to tears. It just brought you to tears. I'm everyone. You know what I miss more than anything? What do you miss? - Your jokes. - My jokes? As terrible as they are. My jokes are not terrible. They're awful. They are hard learned. No, go on tell me a joke. - Tell you a joke. - Tell me a joke. - Okay, just one. - Just one. What do you call a white guy who's at a party dancing then he falls over and has a seizure? I don't know, what? An improvement. That's terrible, that's really not even a funny joke. That's a good one! You're very cute telling it, tell me another one. Alright, what's white and 12 inches? - I don't know. - Absolutely nothing. Where did you hear that? From the ladies in the back room, that's where I get all my jokes. What do you think we're doing back there, playing? Sinners, sinners! No, when I wanna pray I sit up front so God can see me. Why can't you go home? You know you don't have to look for me? You know what today is? Six months. I know that man you've been worrying about, he's been having you on hold for a really long time. You best stay clear of him. I don't like your attitude, Mia-Elise. Give it to me. What are you talking about? You know what I'm talking about, give it to me. When was the last time you were home? Mia-Elise, out of there! You know what? I think sometimes you don't want me talking to you at all. Maybe I won't, maybe I'll just sit here. What do you think? Is that gonna save the day, baby? Hey good looking, long time no see. What are you doing here? Aw, did somebody get up on the wrong side of the car today? Come on, let's have a chat. Meet you on the front porch. You know I'm not completely incompetent, I have this under control. Yeah, well six months and I still haven't seen any new information from you so... These things take time. Did you get that video I sent you? Yeah, it's rough. That's probably the worst I've seen in years. How you holding up? I mean. Why do I get the feeling that you're hiding something from me? 'Cause you're paranoid. Look, I gotta get going, so. Listen, I thought the plan was that you were gonna set this up for me, I bring in the color and then put in a good word for you so you can get your old job back. This is not about my job anymore. What is this, about your mother? We're gonna find what happened to her. I'm gonna find what happened to her. I'm gonna do that. Listen, I'm tired of doing things your way. Here. What am I gonna do with this? Listening devices. I need you to swap them out for the existing ones. Then I can keep track of everything that goes on. Keep one on yourself too just in case I need to find you. Okay. You need to trust that I know what I'm doing, okay? I know how to look at him. I know when to talk, I know when to shut the fuck up, I'm good at this. Yeah, do you have any new information for me? I'm so close. What is taking so long? I know you think you have everything under control but I was in the field for two years. I know that you don't like to build rapport with people but it's important, especially in this particular situation so why don't you just chill the fuck out, okay? Hey! I'm not the bad guy here. Dude! I care about you, okay, I just don't wanna see you getting hurt. Put the lighters in play, alright? Okay. You're welcome. Come here, come talk to your Mama. This thing, this meet up, don't go down that street. Don't go in there. I didn't work all my life. Baby girl, I love you. - What's the password? - Fuck off. Yeah, nice to see you too. It fucking smells like farts in here. Catch, bitch. Housebroken, like you're housebroken. Fire, fire. She caught her dad fucking some beaner and just burnt the whole place down. I didn't hear this one. - Is that true? - Is that true? You fucking suck, dude. What do you think? I don't think you did. Here we go, here we go! Does anybody know where Bryce is? No, he's late, he's late. He didn't text anybody or call anybody? Oh, he didn't text you? Shut the fuck up. Loser! What do I do, do I drink it? Whoa, no, whoa, whoa, whoa. I said I remember my first beer. You fucking chump. How long have you guys been drinking? Not long enough. I been drinking all day because I've been sitting here doing nothing. Yeah, 'cause you're a shithead. You can't keep your mouth shut. Well I caught the fucking news. And you can't stop. The news, what you know about the news? Oh shit, you got a fucking role today? Yeah, it was in prime time. What the fuck was that, was that like a dragster? They had a whole God damn interview on the TV. Yes, okay. I'm standing here on the corner of Fourth and Washington. It was supposed to be a peaceful protest from white supremacists. - Shut the fuck up. - Exactly. A peaceful protest from white supremacists that happened to turn violent. We are standing here with a witness. Please come over here, miss, miss, Sharon, come here, Sharon, what did you see? "Well, I saw the gentleman walking down the street "and it was actually quite beautiful. "They looked very nice and they were clean cut, "they were very tall and they were perfectly fit." Sharon said this, shut the fuck up. Sharon is fucking there! And Sharon, what happened then? Well, someone ran out in the street and they threw something and then it turned violent and then someone was hit over the head with something. Shut up, God damn you! Fucking God! Henry, Henry, Henry! Why does it always end with his dick coming out? Don't worry. - See that? - No, dude. Who's turn is it? Who's fucking turn is it? You got the last one. Hey, no, no. Okay, I'm so sexy, baby. Our little secret. - Just once. - Okay. Did you say yes? Whoa, shit! There's been a twist in the story! Okay, alright. Whoa, they're gonna scissor. Boys, I am officially hard. I officially came. I was hard then it went down, now I'm back. Okay, alright. Don't let her push you off. Come here baby, you're giving me dick cramps. Woo! Dick cramp. What the fucking hell? Let's start the party! How you doing? What's up, brother? I hate it when you make me wait. Do you? So what happened? Surprise butt sex. I did a little press, you know, got this mug out there. And we're here today for white Americans getting the message out that white lives matter. Alright, alright, calm down, happy anniversary. Not now, not now, you got it? I got a present for you too. You got a present for me? Yeah, a present. Is it diamonds? Come here, you. No, you come here. Not like that, no! I really don't like it when you don't text me, that fucking pisses me off. I like when you get bossy. You look tired. I look tired, yeah, that's what I get. No, in like a real good sexy way you look tired. Like the Brawny man. The Brawny man. - Six months. - Six months. You feel different? Mm-mm, not really, do you? You seem different. Let's see this present. All right, sit down. Okay, so this present comes in two parts. Part one. The box, okay if I rip it open? This is pretty. You know what that is? Yes I do. You ready for the second part? But wait, there's more. Let's see it. So basically that just breaks down my lineage. My family came over here from the Netherlands and as you can see. You are 100 percent European decent. Your ancestors were the first to establish a continuous presence in what is now the United States. I'm pure. I know. Do you understand what that means? Mm-hmm. A responsibility. You're gonna stand next to me. Yeah. You're gonna be my queen. Yes. Let's make a fucking baby. Hold on, hold on. What? You have to take the test. You want it in writing? I don't want it in writing, we can frame them and put them side by side over the mantle. - Right there. - Oh yeah, right there. I'm gonna spit in this thing? Yeah. You're disgusting. Hey. We're ready. You ready for your gift? Yeah. - Put your shirt on. - Okay. You might wanna hurry, they're not gonna wait forever. - Here you are. - Fix my hair. Tell 'em to wait, go on. - Ready? - Yeah, no. Fuck it, let's go, let's go. I'm running late but I can call out. Yeah, go on your shift, okay, I'll see you after. Oh, nice touch. Thanks. Alright boys. What's up, brother? They said it was gonna be a surprise, I didn't know you got two niggers here. Ready babe? You like your gift? It's perfect. Check it out boys, he's never looked better. - Yeah? - Yeah. Unwrap it then! What's up with their faces? They're niggers. Never seen one up close before, right? God! What does it smell like? Ebola. Horrendous, filth, pure filth. This is for us, you and me. What about us? It's go time, boys. This is like a quince-fucking-nera! Here we go boys, all up in your eyes! Video, hold on, hold on. I gotta roll tape, roll tape. Let's find out who the fuck you are! - Contestant number one. - We're rolling. Contestant number one, who are you? Take a wild guess, gentlemen. I have no idea. This is Pastor Reynolds. Congratulations, welcome to the show Pastor Reynolds. You got something to fucking say? You got something to say? The floor is yours. He's shy. Stay strong, brother. Jesus Christ, can't even talk to the fucking host, he's gotta talk to the other fucking nigger. We come in peace. You don't like me, do you? You would like to hit me, wouldn't you? Do it, hit me. Vengeance is mine saith the lord. Vengeance is mine and I'm the fucking devil, nigger! Always with it. God have mercy on your soul. God have mercy, Jesus Christ, you talk like a fucking fuck! God have mercy on your soul! Shit! Woo, that was fucking legit! Did you see that? Contestant number two, let's find out who the fuck you are! This one happens to be my personal favorite. Oh okay. Mr. Frederick! Frederick, Mr. Frederick. Fucking Frederick. Also known as Domino, nigger journalist extraordinaire. You gonna write a story about us? See this nigger, Domino here, he's been leading that nigger lives matter movement since he got, I can't even fucking say it! Nigger lives matter, nigger lives matter. You got the power now, boy? You know him, you know him? He's waiting for us. Take a look, nigger. Take a fucking look, nigger. This one's defiant, boy! Stiff neck. I guess he only moves his neck when it's on a cock. All right, step back. - He's not gonna speak? - Shut up. Fuck! You know what, I want this to be special. I wanna do it like James Bird. Who the fuck is James Bird? Jesus Christ, are you kidding? A few years back our boys in Jasper offered a nice man on a helm, pretty soon they like the smell of him. Naturally. So they chained him behind their truck, dragged him six miles down a country road, bones breaking, flesh peeling off, is that what you want? That is some sick fucking shit, Blaze! Fucking James Bird, I like that! Let's do it, we do it? Let's fucking do it, boys! Get him up! Shit, shit, we got a live one! You surprise me every time. - You coming? - Yeah. Let's go. Here we go. Careful. That's a sweet sound. I'm so fucking excited, I'm so fucking excited. I been at the house all day doing shit and I now I find out what you're getting at. Would you calm down? Henry's gonna finally get his shot. I love this kid. That's what I'm fucking talking about! All damn day I don't do anything! Hey, are we locked up? - Let's go, boss! - Lock and load. You wouldn't last three seconds. You're loud, you're obnoxious, you're dumb. Yeah, go on, go on. You're a fucking Jack Russell terrier piece of shit. At least he didn't say chihuahua, then I'd really be offended. Fucking wiener dog. The point is to stay quiet. Obviously you have no fucking concept of that. Stay fucking quiet? What the fuck happened out there? Tell me what you saw. It was a march, I get that, but no one was saying anything, no one was fucking singing, there were no chants. Say what you want about those fucking faggots, at least they're proud of what they are. Are you defending them? He's defending faggots! You just don't fucking get it, kid! See this nigger right here? Nobody knows we have him! And no one will. Except the council. You see he's our ticket in the tightrope. See the show we've given that we're doing tonight? They let us in on official communications! About time. It's their insurance policy just in case someone here decides to bitch out. I'm looking at you. The fucking march, that's just the beginning. You fucking get it? Boys, I must be dumb as doggy shit because I don't know what the fuck you're talking about. - Of course you don't. - Jesus Christ. Tell me what you saw on the TV. I saw you guys walking down the street - and you're acting like... - Like what? Like a bunch of pussies! I saw a nigger like this hit Price over the fucking head with a two by four. And what were the good people at home thinking? Hmm? A month from now you're gonna see marches like this in cities all over the country. We might take a beating or two. We mourn our brothers and sisters we lost along the way. Every channel in every home, good white people will finally see what we see. They'll know that unless they do something, these fucking boot lip motherfuckers are gonna rob us of everything we own. It's the fucking Planet of the Apes out there! Helter skelter! And niggers like this will run the world. And then we fight back. Only when there's no other option but to defend us. On top we're a peaceful flower, underneath, a serpent ready to strike. You get it now, you dumb dumb? Look, people give these cops, they give these cops all this fucking flack for shooting these niggers, maybe for good reason, but we're gonna give them all the incentive they need to keep pulling that fucking trigger! Frederick! Domino. Domino, do you get what the fuck we're saying in that stupid fucking head of yours? Is this getting into your fucking nigger brain? It's a really small brain. Let me break this down for you so you can understand. There's gonna be no more fucking rain dances and there's gonna be no more friendship, because you, you're just fucking alligator bait. See, I have a dream, and that's that one day all your people will be thrown on top of a mountain that burns white hot. And those bodies will be burning and that burning will serve as a beacon, a beacon for future generations, to let them know that this country is on its way to greatness. Tell me, Jimbo, what do you think? Alright, alright. I'm just getting started. It's like a fucking dog with a bone, man. I think he's fucking trying to say something. Speak bitch! And though the way grows darker still, shadow by silence on the wing, with great defiance in my throat, I pierce the darkness with a note, and I can sing. This motherfucker's crazy! I go not over the broken past and I dread whatever time they bring, no night is dark, no day is long, when in my heart this was the song and I can sing! The fuck is that! We don't speak nigger, son, you're gonna have to translate it for us. He wants to sing a song for us. His last fucking words are a fucking song. I'll play you a cotton picking song. Sing for us. Sing! Is this fucking Broadway? What else you got to sing, nigger, what else you got to sing? That it, for you to sing? I'm the one that kills you. Hey cut it out, cut it out, we're here. I think he thinks he means it, man. Shh, the boss said shut up. Sorry, boss. I'll pull up here, should be enough room. Wanna drive? I'm fucking ready, I'm so fucking ready. - Have some fun. - Okay. We're putting you back in the chains. Sit fucking still! Fuck! Drive! Put the fucking gun down! Put the motherfucking gun down! I'm not fucking with you, drive this fucking van! Okay, I'm driving! I'm driving the fucking car! Put the fucking gun down! You said you're not one of them? You sat there while they fucking killed him! So who the fuck are you? Your wallet and your ID, it's back at the house? Are they back at the house? I don't give a fuck about that. No, if they're back at the house they'll find you. No, no, I don't care, whatever, if that happens I'll fucking deal with it, just fucking drive this van. Oh yeah, did you fucking deal with it now? We're going back to the house. We'll get your shit and get out of here. No, no, no, there's something you're not telling me. Why you wanna go back so bad? They took my Mom. She was a patient at, she was a patient at the hospital and there was this nurse and she kept looking at us and paying way too much fucking attention and one day I was leaving after bringing my Mom soup and there was this fucking van was there, it was parked right out-fucking-side. The next day I got a call that my Mom was missing and somebody said she could've walked out by herself but somebody told me they saw someone push her out of the hospital and I saw this fucking van! Look, I'm sorry for whatever you're going through, okay? But listen to me, I'm fucking done! You don't get to be done. How long do you think it's gonna take before somebody fucking picks you up? Look, I'm sorry. I am, I'm sorry. He was my pastor. I have known him my whole life. He was the coach of my Little League. No! If I go back with you we're taking him with us. We can't take him with us, they'll think we did it. I don't care, okay, I'm not gonna leave his body there. You need your proof or whatever, right? Okay, well I need mine. I'm not just gonna leave him there. If I leave him there he disappears, I won't do that to him. Okay, I'll help you load the body in this van then you can take it wherever the fuck you want but it's not gonna be long until someone runs the plates. Yeah and what happens to you? I could give a fuck what happens to me. We have to get those chains off of you. We're here. What are you looking for? Things bad enough for you yet? You gonna save the day with that little tude? What are you looking for? I'm not in there. Shut up. Baby girl, let's go home. Let's go home, you gotta have some kind of sense here. I'm not in there. Nobody needs a magical black lady. Magical, am I? Shut up! I don't believe in magic either. But you gotta believe in something that makes sense. You're all about science. Go home! Fuck. He's gone. The fuck? Special Investigator Tillman, please leave a message. Pick up your fucking phone! Who was that? So why were you in there? I don't understand, are you a cop? I'm not a fucking cop, just shut the fuck up, okay, and keep your voice down. Just give me some time to fucking think, I'm gonna take you somewhere safe and then we figure this out, okay? Get in the car. What, this is their plan? March in these cities and kill these people? They're not gonna get far. What, you're gonna stop them, is that it? Phoenix, Philadelphia, Boston, you're gonna be in all those places? So if you're not a cop then what are you? I was an analyst, it's different. The last time I was in a car with police they were taking me in for a crime I didn't commit. I was supposed to go to college. My little brother, he got into a lot of dumb shit. And one day the police, they raid our house, looking for him, looking for the drugs. It's my little brother, I'm not just gonna let my little brother go to prison so I step up and say, no it's not him, it's me, I'm the one you want. Done, they don't even ask another question, just throw me in handcuffs, take me off. Doesn't matter if they were right as long as one less black kid is off the streets... There has to be more to it than that, sounds complicated. They didn't just pick some random kid up, they picked you up. Yeah, okay. Yeah, you get the struggle, right? You know what it means to be black in America. Yeah, you know about black Wall Street? Huh, you know about Tulsa? So a long time ago a lot of black Americans moved to Tulsa, Oklahoma. And this is obviously during the time of segregation so the city is divided. There's a white side and a black side and the black people can't shop at white-owned businesses because of laws prohibiting them form doing so. So what do the black people say? They say you know what, fuck it. We'll keep our money, we'll make our own businesses, we'll survive and you know what ends up happening to them? They actually end up making a very thriving community. There's a happy ending, right? Except for a few years later a giant race riot takes place and in a matter of hours the entire city is burned to the ground. 42 square blocks, gone, done, in a matter of hours. And you know who was part of all this? Yeah, the KKK had their hand in it but you know who else was there? Just regular white people who heard what they were saying and said mmm, that's a good fucking idea! We should do that! But no, nobody knows about this. It's not in textbooks, it's not taught in school, you don't see it on fucking Buzzfeed, no, no, no, no, no. You know why, because journalists ignore it. City officials, they sweep it under the rug. You wanna come at me talking about you know something, man, that right there in the very definition is white privilege. No, 'cause you don't know about it, you don't need to know about it, it doesn't effect your life, you get to go home at night and say oh, it's probably more complicated, there's probably more to the article. No, but you know everything there is to know about being black because you probably voted for Obama, right? Probably have a hip hop album, fuck you, man. Fuck, what the fuck is that? What, what's wrong with you? Look behind us. What the fuck, what the fuck, what the fuck, what the fuck! Just take it slow, just take it slow. Just drive. If this is them, I'm ready, pull over. Fuck! Just some stupid kids. Fuck. Yo, just watch the road. Fuck. Tell me what happened at the rally. You heard your friends, you saw... I wanna hear from you. I don't know. Fucking tell me what happened at the God damn rally! Yo, shut your fucking mouth! I told you, I don't fucking remember. That's why I was walking with Pastor Reynolds. We were going home. We stopped to get some waters at a gas station. I go inside, I come back out, he's not out there, so I cut back through they alley. I think maybe he's just reading scripture to some homeless lady, he usually does that and when I get in there, I hear a noise, I turn around, something hits me and next thing I know I'm waking up in the back of that van. Looks clear. I'm sorry about what happened to your Mom. What was her name? Lynnae. Just keep an eye out for me, I'm gonna let you know when to come inside, okay? Is this her? Leave it. This is where you grew up. Can I just take a look at your face? I'm just gonna shine this in your face, okay? Fuck. Sit down, I'm gonna grab the first aid. So what happens now? We wait. I got it. Tell me about that poem. That's nothing. Tell me. For a while, I didn't know where it came from or anything but I was walking in from the yard and a couple of guys came out of nowhere and started beating the shit outta me. One of 'em almost broke my head and the guards that too me inside, they told me I had a letter. So I open it up and there's this poem inside. And though the way grows darker still, shadow by silence on the wing, with great defiance in my throat, I pierce the darkness with a note. I read that shit every night. Not everybody was that big into poetry, I'm not saying I still am but that poem, that poem takes me somewhere. Where does it take you? In the woods. In a log cabin. My grandma, she's sleeping on the couch and Family Feud is on the TV. It's like around that time of Thanksgiving and I'm outside on a deck in slippers and a robe looking at one of those tin mugs with hot cocoa inside. I just listen to the wind goes through the trees. That sounds perfect. So what about you? Where would you be? Where would I be? New York in a little apartment, nothing fancy but there's this jazz band downstairs, all the regulars know me because I come in and I play my music. I'm on stage and I'm singing something I wrote. Just that feeling, so nice. And then when I'm done this guy buys me drinks and we flirt until closing and then I think about taking him upstairs and sleeping with him but I probably don't. It's great. Alright, let's hear what you got. Fuck off. No man, come on, we're in New York right now. We're at Tiny's. ♪ So now ♪ ♪ Won't make it today ♪ ♪ You're on the highway ♪ ♪ Taking the long way home ♪ ♪ Slowly but surely ♪ ♪ You're on your way now ♪ ♪ You're on your way down to your town ♪ ♪ Won't make it today ♪ ♪ Won't say you're sorry ♪ ♪ Won't even call to say you're late ♪ ♪ And she waited by the front gate ♪ ♪ With the smile on her face ♪ ♪ And she waited and she waited ♪ ♪ Never made it again today ♪ Fuck, just stay here.

Right, I'll take care of this mess. Will you go handle your coos in there? Listen to me, I know this hurts.

You fucking hear me? I want you guys to go around the back, let her put a hurt on me, don't wake the neighbors, you hear me? Let's go. I admire your courage, Blaze.

I'm gonna save you from this guilt place that they've crippled you with. Got him! Bring him to the living room. This guilt that has turned you against your people.

We're cops, lawyers, or nurses, CEO's, and we're everywhere. The fuck down! Please. What happened to you, Blaze? Don't do this. And Tillman brought you to me and I was supposed to make an example with you. Don't do this. Do you know what happens to a race traitor? Look at me. You know what we have. You know our love. Come here. Come here! Open your mouth. Open your mouth. Open it. Who did this to you, Blaze? Who did this to you? Look at me. Tell me about it. Tell me. The boy is done. Hey. You okay? I said are you okay? Go get your shit. I've got you. It's okay. It's okay, come here, I've got you. It's okay, baby girl. You're home. It's alright, now. Is that him? Yes, baby. You're a terrible liar. We have to put hate behind us. No, we have to put hate in front of us. No baby, no. So what now? Life is over. Hey. Your life's not over. You just have a new one. The next one is in Phoenix. Hey, hey, look at me. It's just you and me, okay? Yeah, okay It's just us now. And that's how it all started.
