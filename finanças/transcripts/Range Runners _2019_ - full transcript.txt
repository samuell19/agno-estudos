What you doing on your ass? You're still breathing though, right? This is what people call a teachable moment. You know what that means? They call it that because these are the moments that shape who we are. Of all the pain and heartache in the years to come, this is when we first learn how to cope. You better look at me when I'm talking to you. Whenever you start to feel like you can't go on, you keep in mind that all that negativity ain't coming from your physical body. It's all up here, girl. Your body will always fight against you, that's what it was designed to do. Don't let it. This is your vessel. Your tool. It doesn't tell you what to do, it's the other way around. It really hurts. Maybe it does. Years from now it might still hurt. But are you gonna tell people that you hurt your knee because you fell down once, or are you gonna tell people that you fell down, but in spite of the pain, you pulled yourself off the ground, you pushed on, and you persevered? Now get on up. Clock's still running. You look like hell. It's good to see you. I was watching that. Bullshit. You were snoring. You feel better? You smell better, at least. What? Just trying to figure it all out, I guess. Well let me know how it goes. What's it like out there? Exhausting. Come on, Mel. 400 miles I've been following you, and while you're out having your grand adventure, I'm stuck in the car all day waiting for you to show up. We've got a long way to go yet. Give me something to go on. I run, I eat, I sleep. There's rocks, trees, dirt, miles and miles, and no end in sight. I haven't found God or anything, if that's what you're asking. What do you want from me? Probably best if we both get some sleep. You think you're tired, try raising a three-year-old. Can you turn the TV back on? Can't fall asleep without it. I come bearing gifts. Too bad we need it. It's a bear bell. You wear it on your pack to ward off black bears. I read about it on the internet. I also read that singing at the top of your lungs as you hike works too. Oh, one more thing. Ah, come on, I already told you. It's prepaid, for emergencies. Just in case. It's useless. I won't even have service out there. I'm not asking for much. Just hold onto it. It'll make me feel better, okay? Thank you. Mm-mm, nah. I've got 200 miles to go before the next support stop-off. If weather holds up, I should be able to make it in eight days. Mom told me to tell you you're wasting your life, by the way. What a refreshing change of pace. Give her a break, she feels like everyone abandoned her. It is so quiet. Is anybody else out there? Too early in the season. Most of the through-hikers have been in the trail head by now. Nobody could ever keep up with you. I know you don't wanna hear this, but I'm your sister, so I'm gonna tell you anyway. You don't have to prove anything to anyone now. Him least of all. Maybe at the next location, you'll consider taking an extra day. We can get some real food, maybe a couple drinks? And we're getting a better place. Somewhere with a goddamn hot tub. You might enjoy all this masochistic caveman shit, but as far as I'm concerned, I'm on vacation. We'll see. Promise me you'll call. See you in eight days. You okay? Yeah, it's nothin'. Just my dogs are barkin' is all. Looks more like they're biting. These are pretty bad. Yeah. I'm gone for five minutes and you manage to pick up a stray. She was just passing by. She stopped by to give me a hand. Mighty considerate. Personally I'd have just left him where he lay. Still thinking about it, to be honest. Not ideal hiking wear. Yeah. Might've bit off a little more than I can chew. Didn't think we'd be stuck out here this long. You want me to take a look at that? I've got a first aid kid. He just sprained it. He tripped over a log. Clumsy me. You know, I got a few dozen sprains of my own. Stress fractures and shin splints too. Congratulations. Funny thing is, through all those injuries, I've never once seen a sprain bleed before. I'd recommend you clean whatever that is. And change the bandages. Just my two cents. Try to keep off those feet. Maybe next time invest in a pair of hiking boots? Thanks. Morning. Hey. Sorry if we startled you, we rolled in pretty late. Didn't hear you come in is all. You afraid that thing's gonna walk off in the middle of the night or what? I don't carry a bear bat. This way if I know if anything comes rifling through my pack looking for food. That's smart. It is at that. Something wrong? I was just thinking about how you helped out Jared yesterday. You were off into the wild yonder even before he got a chance to thank you. Got a schedule to keep is all. You seem pretty focused. Running like the dickens as I recall. Ain't that right, Jared? Like the ever-lovin' dickens. That's what I said. Didn't think we'd ever catch up with you. Pretty hardcore. Camping out here without any gear. What are you guys, day hikers? I guess you could say that we're more purists. We like to rough it. We're a little out of our element here. Speak for yourself, Pop. You're smothering it. Give it room to breathe, till it takes. Then add the big stuff. That's what I keep tellin' him. So where you off to in such a hurry? I got a lot of miles today. You haven't even had breakfast yet. Go on, then. Pop a squat. We won't trouble you none. What kinda knife is that? Fixed blade? You keep it sharp. Kinda the whole point, isn't it? So, what's your deal? What do you mean? You just seem like somebody that's got someplace else they'd rather be. Like I'd rather be alone, you mean? No. No, it's more than that. Most people that come out to places like this are lookin' for a sense of peace and quiet. They're sort of calm, I guess. What makes you think I'm not calm? You seem like a pretty intense person. Restless maybe, I don't know. No offense. The trail, all this, has nothing to do with why I'm out here. It's the distance I'm after. I see. I guess it's in our nature to do things that aren't in our nature. Yeah. What's that supposed to be? It's a train whistle. I really need to hit the trail. Daylight's wasting. Hey, you know, maybe we could tag along. You guys would just slow me down. If you don't mind. Aww, shucks. I was just startin' to grow fond of the thing. You know what? Keep it. Hey, can't... Back off! Okay, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Look, can't you see that we're desperate here, okay? Like I can barely walk, and I, you can't just leave us out here, please. You're being rude to my friend there. I'm leaving. You're in my way. Hey, this doesn't have to get out of hand, okay? Let's just calm... Fuck that. You wanna leave, go ahead. But we're keeping the pack. Maybe you can just give us some food, or your first aid kit, we're just looking for a break here. Please? Hey, wait! No, stop. You're just making this worse! Please, stop! Stop it! You done playing grab-ass? I can't fucking run like this. You watch that goddamn mouth of yours. It ain't work if it ain't hard. You have no idea what your body's capable of until you've felt the absolute limit of what you think is physically possible. Until you reach that point, you're just making excuses. What if I faint? Then you will know what your limits are, and figure out how to push past them. This isn't how it's supposed to be, man. Nice and quiet, that's what we said, that's what we said. In and out. What do you want from me? She had the goddamn thing tied to her wrist. What did you think was gonna happen? This isn't exactly keeping a low profile, man. Don't you think we're in enough shit as is, without having a goddamn hostage? Parker's not gonna like this. Fuck Parker. This doesn't change a thing. We still hold all the cards. Now quit your whining... No, I didn't sign up for this, man. You wanna go runnin' off hidin' in the woods for the rest of your life, that's fine, I've had enough. Need I remind you why you're here? I got nothin' to lose, believe me. But you. Share it. 50/50. That's what was agreed upon. Now, shut up, give me that. You're starting to make me nervous. What are we gonna do about her? We can't just drag her along with us. No one has to find her. Not till this is long over with. No, no. Fuckin' crazy, man? We are not killing her, you understand me? Relax. We'll just have to leave her here. Buy us enough time to get some distance under our heels. Scout's honor. All right. Not a hair on her head. All right. Where you think you're goin', lady? You trying to steal from us? Your girlfriend here is quite a crafty coos, ain't she? Let's go, sweetheart. Ups-a-daisy. Quit your wriggling. Get me some more of that paracord. You already used it all on her wrists. Don't put the cows to pasture when the slaughterhouse is waitin'. That's what my daddy used to say. Don't fuckin' touch me. Hey, hey. I told my friend here that I wasn't gonna hurt you. I like to think of myself as a man of my word. But you keep causin' a ruckus, and you'll make a liar out of me yet. Now. That belt is comin' off, one way or the other. Now I can cut it off you, along with whatever else is in the way, or you can keep still and be rid of us all the sooner for it. Up to you, darlin'. But choose now. 'Cause I'm not in then mood to fuck around. Take this. Nice and tight. All right, enough. Let's fuckin' go, man. You mind your manners while I'm gone. Daddy's gotta go to work. You better hope I don't see you again, motherfucker! I'll be dreamin' of you, sweetheart. I'll take that water. Don't take your eyes off that fuckin' bag. This isn't what I wanted, when I saw you the other day, and I am so sorry that you got mixed up in all this. But like I said, we're... Desperate? Yeah. I got that. I just want you to understand. This is not the type of person I am. You're right. You're a fuckin' coward. Fuck! Okay. Get it together, Mel. Get it. You wanna knock that shit off? Supposed to keep bears away. Nevermind the goddamn bears. Bears'd be the least of your problems if you don't shut your lips and give me some peace. You gonna answer it? Not yet. I wanna put a few miles between us and the bloodhounds. You all right? Fuck off. Man, we're gonna drop dead if we keep this up. Come on. Don't you think we ought to address that? It's clearly bothering you. Why don't you worry about your damn self, gimpy? Roll your sleeve up, Mr. Badass. That thing gets any more infected, we're gonna have to lop off your whole arm. Just you try it, you fuckin' asshole. I'll gut you and hang you by your entrails. All right. I was just messin' around, take it easy. Maybe we could build a fire or something, burn it... No fire. It'd be easier to... No fire. Fuck. Move your fingers. There we go. All right. Good as new. Much obliged. Ow! You hear that? Yeah. Probably just a coyote. You know what would keep 'em away? A fire! You smell that, you little rat fuckers?! This is my territory! It's claimed. So stay the fuck away! I wanna share something with you an old drill sergeant taught us back in basic. Something called the crack theory. The most miserable thing about being out in the field is getting caught in the rain. Whenever it started up, we would stop everything to get out a poncho, bring out our socks, whatever. It's only natural to want to keep from feeling the discomfort of it. Right up until you feel that water dripping down the crack of your ass. At that point it simply becomes a part of life. You're forced to give it up. But even before the rain ever came, he had us take out our canteens, turn 'em over on top of our heads. Then we crawled out into the dirt until we were caked in it. See what I'm gettin' at? By the time we were done, we were already soaked through as much as we could possibly get. We accepted our condition. Dropped the pretense of making anything easier for ourselves. And we were free to do what we needed to do, without another thought about our personal comfort. Sometimes it's best to just embrace the discomfort. To truly immerse yourself in it. We are not here to make it easy for ourselves. You gotta have the training. I ain't gonna tell you again. That fuckin' bag leaves your back one more time, I'm gonna staple the goddamn thing to your shoulder blades. Keep it on. We're never gonna get anywhere, you keep poppin' a squat every 30 steps. However did I wind up stuck with such a blubbering pussy? It's embarrassing, really. I didn't hear you complain when you got me mixed up in this goddamn mess. I'm not the one that came to you beggin' for an easy way to make some cash. You just wanna remember that. At least when we were locked up, you still had some fight in you. One bitch on the outside lets you squeeze her tits, and suddenly, you go softer than my granddad when he forgets to take his little blue pill. Listen, I am trying to make a better life for myself. You wanna begrudge me that, fine. You leave Celia out of it. "A better life." Is that what you call it? She's at home right now, watchin' talk shows in between shifts at the truck stop glory hole while you're out here with another woman rubbin' your feet for ya. But far be it for me to intrude on your marital bliss. How about it? That bitch back there was right, you know. You really are a coward. Wayland? Don't kill me. Don't kill me, I have a little girl back home. Oh yeah? You tie her up and leave her for dead too? I'm sorry! I didn't have a choice. Shut up! We're going for a walk. What your planning, it's not gonna work. You don't know who you're dealing with. Keep moving. Listen to me, listen to me. We can just go. You and me. I didn't want to get your pack, it was all him. I just wanna get back to my family. I say you shut up. You're gonna get us both killed. Drop it. Do it now. For fuck's sake, Wayland. Help. God damn, sweetheart. Maybe I shoulda left that piece of thing tied up back there and partnered up with you instead. Step away. Over there. Oh, hell, darlin'. You came all the way up here just for that? Thing is, I ain't leavin' these woods. Not for a while yet. But I'm still gonna need the goods you got tucked away in there, far more than I need both of his eyes intact. So, you do what you gotta do. I won't blame you for it. No! All right, all right, all right. Let's just all take a deep breath here. Back up! Fair trade. I get back what you stole from me and you get back whatever the fuck is in this bag. That's all I want. Now. What's it gonna be? You ain't doing shit. So you can just stop with this nonsense, put down the bag, and then we can talk a little bit. Hey, what the hell do you think you're doing, that's private. Hey, hey! All right. You just put that on the ground right fuckin' now! No, what are you doing? What the fuck are you doing! What the fuck did you just do! Get the pack! Fuck! Fuck! No! Stop! Don't you move, you cunt. You stay right there. I'm gonna come down there and I'm gonna rip your goddamn eyes out of their sockets. Don't you fuckin' move! I will fucking end you! You fucking bitch! Hey, Wayland. Come on, it's done. The hell it is! Not until I squeeze the life out of that meddlesome bitch! What good is it gonna do you, man? Get your fuckin' hands off of me! Hey, listen to me! I need you to focus, man! I can't deal with this, I need you to stay focused! Okay! Okay. I'm focused. All right. Now what the fuck we gonna do, huh? Parker is out for blood, man. And we just lost our leverage. We're fucked, man. Just settle down, it'll be all right. What are you talkin' about, it'll be all right? We lost our bargaining chip. What are we supposed to say, huh? "Hey Parker, we screwed up the exchange. "Hey, sorry that everything went to shit. "Oh, but don't worry, we lost your stash too?" We're fucked, man. The both of us. All right, we need to get out of here. Hitch a ride. What are you talking about? I can barely walk! Okay. So we'll go back to the shelter, okay? We'll hole down for the night. And then we'll eat something, okay? Fine, fine, fine. Just quit your snivelin'. - All right? - Yeah. Just grab that and let's go. I hope it hurts, you bitch. I hope it rots off your body and the coyotes tear you to pieces! You hear me?! Hear me?! Melanie. Melanie. Look at me now. How does it feel? It hurts. No, I mean how does it feel to know that after all those miles and all that time, you just can't run anymore? What are you doing here, Chloe? You tell me. I need help. 10 years running every marathon possible, and all of a sudden you tell me you want to run through the mountains. Why here? Why now? I've been trying to puzzle it out. And before you start babbling about distance and needing a new challenge, you should assume I already know the answer to that question. But I wanna hear you say it. No more bullshit, Mel. Just the truth. Dad came out here once. It was before Mom, when he first got the Army. Said he had spend so much time being told where to be, what to do, that he just wanted to be on his own for a while. It was the only time he felt truly free. He never told me about that. Not surprising, though. He was always closer to you. What are you talkin' about? He treated me like shit. You were his little princess, not me. That's bullshit, Mel, and you know it. You think he dragged you out to the track six times a week because he loved you less? Hours and hours spent training you. Giving up his Saturdays at home so he could make sure you were the best you could possibly be. He put all his hopes and dreams into you. For Christ's sake, Melanie, he gave you a shot at the Olympics. Gave it to me? You don't think I worked for it? And for what? You just threw it all away. Right when he finally thought all the work he put into you would pay off. What was it again? Steroids? EPO. How could you do that to him? How could he do that to me? Do you think I wanted to spend all those Saturdays out there runnin' against that stupid fuckin' stopwatch? And watching him shake his head in disappointment? I never wanted to be in the goddamn Olympics, Chloe. That was his dream, not mine. What about what I wanted? What about my hopes, my dreams? Did he ever stop to ask? Let me tell you something. The look on his face when I had told him what I had done. That was the single greatest moment of my life. And I never forgave myself for it. Now you're here. Broken. Well I hate to break it to you, kiddo, but you're gonna have to run a little bit farther. It's not gonna feel good, and it's not gonna get any better, but at least one way or another, it'll all be over soon. Are you gonna tell people you hurt your knee because you fell down once? Or are you gonna tell them that you fell down once, but in spite of the pain, you picked yourself up off the ground, you pushed on and you persevered? Now get up. Clock's still running. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Hello? I'm here. Hello! Can somebody hear me? Hey, down here! What are you smiling about? You happy with this time? That's almost a full two seconds faster than anyone on this team can pull off. And a full three-tenths of a second slower than you ran it just last week. You think that's progress? Who are you running against? You think you're trying to beat out some runner from some other school or from your own team, you're mistaken. You think these other runners care about your time? They don't give a shit about you. All they're focused on is their own performance. They're not even looking at you. They're looking deep down inside themselves for whatever sliver of willpower will take them past their limit. When you are out there, your only enemy is yourself and the clock. You need to stop thinking about everything else and focus on this, because this is the only thing that matters. Run it again. I'm here! I'm here! Stop! Please! Please please stop, stop please, please stop! Please stop. Please. Jesus, Mary, and Joseph. You all right, sweetheart? So two men did this to you? That's just truly awful. I'm so sorry that happened to you. I'll get the staties out here right away to start lookin' for 'em, but, it's an awful lot of woods to cover. Any guess as to where we should start? About 30 miles in, I landed at a hiking shelter up on a bluff, near the ridge line. That's where they were headed. Yeah, I know the place. Hey, we'll find 'em. Don't you worry. All right now. First things first, that knee has got me worried. Maybe not a bone break, but I'll call ahead and have an ambo standing by at headquarters just in case. I'll only be right over there to call it in, hon. Not gonna leave you. They're waiting for us, you think you can make it? This was theirs. Someone just tried to call it, if it helps. Yeah, I'm sure it will at that. All right, now you just get settled in there. Yep. All right, mind the leg. Okay. Get you fixed up in no time. Where's the headquarters building? Did you try calling anybody with that phone you had? The police, or? I couldn't get a signal. Well, that's all right, then. So. Where's that backpack? What is this? I'm sorry about this, honey. I really am. But I need you to answer me, now. The blue backpack you got that phone from. I wanna know where it is. They still have it? I wouldn't know. We make regular checks on that shelter throughout the hiking season. It's about a mile in there. They'll never know we're comin'. That we're coming? Well. I can't exactly leave you here. I mean, cell phones aren't for shit, but that radio gets perfect reception. But you'll survive. I'm not the bad guy here, sweetheart. But we all gotta play our part. I believe I met a friend of yours. Now if what my supplier tells me is true, you already have one bullet hole in you. Don't make this hard. Good boy. Have a seat. Both of you. Now then. I think it's time we all had a little talk. Now I already heard the report from the state police, but now, I wanna hear your version. Parker, this is not our fault. They started shooting at us. Are you gonna tell me that was before one of them took four knife wounds? You know the only reason I'm not in jail and there aren't dogs chasin' you down like game through these woods is because that man kept his mouth shut, despite the dozens of stitches he received. And why's that? Because he is a goddamn professional. Which is more than I can say for the two of you. But that's all in the past, right? Hmm? You gave them the money, they gave you what you paid for. As far as I'm concerned, the deal is done. So. Let's put all this nastiness behind us, you give me my product, I let you go on your way. Fair's fair. You do still have what I paid for, I hope. Oh sugar. Please tell me you still have it. We did everything we were supposed to do. We did the exchange, and then everything went to hell, so we just ran, we didn't know where else... All right, one last chance before I lose my temper. Where are my drugs? I know where they are. I snatched the backpack from the skinny one. Took the phone, stashed the bag, right before they threw me off the cliff. You're a goddamn liar. You know what, sweetheart? After all this, I never did get your name. It's Mel. Well, Mel. You got me in quite the pickle here. On one hand, you've got no reason to lie to me, do you? Then again, I got no reason to trust you either. But we got common ground, you and I. We both want what's rightfully ours. So let's help each other out. Us girls gotta stick together, after all. Am I right? I'll tell him where it's at. Me and him go to the car, I tell him the location, and I drive away. That's the deal. How do I know you're telling the truth? Like you said. I got no reason to lie to you. But I'd feel much better with that gun trained on him instead of me. All right, loves. You heard the lady. Jared, looks like you're going for a walk. You fuckin' blind? I want you to understand something, Wayland. I saw how that girl looked when she came out of the woods, and you're going to answer for that. I promise you. But until that time comes, you just might wanna shut your mouth. Look, I don't want any more problems here, okay? We've all been through hell these past... Fair's fair, partner. I think you'll agree. Woo! Your little girlfriend's flown the coop, Jared. Don't worry, buddy. I'm gonna take real good care of her. I'm sure that your cock-shrivelin' wife will be glad to know that I'm lookin' out for you through all this. Shoot you. Who knows? Maybe I'll take real good care of her too when this is all said and done. Please. Wait, wait. Come on, darlin'. I made you something. You like playing games, don't you? Of course you do. It's all right, darlin'. It's just fine, 'cause I got a real doozy for you. Olly olly oxen-free. Come on out and claim your prize. That was mighty unkind of you. And after all that I've done for you. Hell, darlin'. You oughta be thankin' me. All that fight in you. All that piss and vinegar. That's there because I brought it out of you. I made you. I'll be dreaming of you, sweetheart. Probably take rescue crews a couple hours to get here, I had to guess. Probably longer once it gets dark. You'll have a hell of a time explaining all this to them. But at least you'll live to see your wife and daughter again. Either that, or you can lay here and bleed to death. It's up to you. I know that I'm hard on you. And I know you probably hate me for it. But it's important that you understand one thing. No matter how hard I push you, or how many times you fail. I'm proud of you, baby.
