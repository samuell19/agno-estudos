"I Can Speak" "New Text Message 1" "New Text Message 2" "Good luck at your new office!" "You left at the first round? It was your farewell party?" I'm Park Minjae. I've been assigned to Civil Affairs. Nice to meet you. You're the new guy? Is this your first post? I transferred from Yongchun. I'm Level 9. Nice to meet you. I'm Sohn Ahyoung. Level 8. I look young, right? I started here right after college. You got into civil service after something else? Hi, new guy. Could've bought ginseng drinks. But you bought this cheap one in case I'm allergic to ginseng? It only turns my pee yellow and makes my heart race. I'm sure it would be hard for us to get along. Civil affairs. Minjae, could you explain... Maybe later. He came on a rainy night as always. -What do you mean? -It rained last night. Right. I should have brought a red rose on my way back home on rainy Wednesday. It's been months! After rainy nights, our market building walls got cracks and the floor sank! So I checked the forecast and went on stakeouts. He shows up whenever it rains! Is he a serial killer wearing red panties? What do you think he's doing? -Urinating? -For 10 minutes? Maybe he had to go really badly. It's sulfuric acid. He pretends to pee and pours acid! Sulfuric acid on the cracks to break it down more... ...to cause corrosion! I told you to shut it down at night! Drunk folks go and pee there. Do the drugs. That's why it must be redeveloped. Who are you? The building owner. You threatened with thugs and bought it for cheap. Think you can redevelop it without the tenants' consent? Ma'am! Mr Ma purchased it legally and the redevelopment is undecided. We'll handle everything well. -Handle what! -Good luck! I said the security lights went out long ago, but you did nothing! They still didn't fix it? It's in a dark, back alley! What if something happens at dark? Damn civil servants! What are you doing? You're violating my portrait rights. Complaint-related evidence collection process must be recorded too. Who are you? Are you the new guy here for that skinny guy? Did you submit a complaint for the security lights? What? If not, please start by filling out this form. Everything is done according to procedure. Procedure? Forget that. Come with me and fix it now. Number 4, please. I was here first. Right at 9:00. Did you take a number? What number? I never took a number here before. Then please start from now. Goodbye. Number 6, please? "Park Minjae" Mr Park Minjae. I'll see you around. Goblin Granny. She's the biggest problem in town who everyone knows. Goblin Granny? Wherever there's any illegal problem in our town... She'll find it and report it! But she's our number one biggest headache. Hey. Put your helmet on. I'm busy here! Take your crate! Know how many complaints she filed so far? A staggering 8000! How is that possible? She reported a complaint everyday for 20 years except for holidays. Do you own this street? Don't block, move! As long as people can pass by! What now, ma'am? Look at the wires! They're ripped up! If it rains, we'll get electrocuted. Do something about this, officials! They're fine, ma'am. Please! And look at the sewage. It's clogged up and reeks. Stop paging me! What illegal banner? He got elected President. So what? It's time the banner came down! -But the President... -Cut it down! Please let it go this once? -Hi, Mr Yang. Good to see you here! -I'm going to quit my job. -These are just minor things. -They pay you for this job. She complained through five different directors here. And since a Level 6 like me was a Level 9 like you, dude, think you can handle her? I'll just go by the book. Number 17, please? Did you fill out the form? Of course. According to procedure. It's been filed. -Number 18, please. -It's me again. -Number 19, please. -That's me too. Ma'am? If you take all the numbers, what about the others? Miss Sohn? I'll handle all her complaints. Could you see to the others? Ma'am? I'll take all of them. Sure. Here you are. Minjae? The director wants you. The director? To his office. Chief Yang is at his office, too. Okay. Mr Im. Could you do these for me? Sure. Go ahead. Let me see. What's all this? Geez. You prepared so much. Come in. Have a seat. You worked at Yongchun district? I'm friends with the director there. Isn't he in a different party? Friends over politics, sir? I switched parties to run for office. Like a bat. You ran for the people and not the party. I heard you're a capable man. Level 9 who works as well as a Level 7 or even 6. Level 9 officials work hardest. A building redevelopment is delayed due to civil complaints and it's a big headache. I read the file Chief Yang gave me. There is a way, sir. Our district office... ...can issue an order to stop the redevelopment. An order to stop me? That's crazy! It's not. Once the order is issued, Yelim Construction can file a lawsuit against our office in protest. A lawsuit? Yes. Yelim purchased all stores legally. And the safety diagnosis of it recently dropped from B to D. Which means our office will lose the lawsuit for sure. And the problem of tenants claiming recent damages... ...can be solved by adjusting the safety diagnosis period well. Why would we issue the order when we will obviously lose the lawsuit? I get it. It shows we did everything within the legal limits. A true government style solution! We don't take responsibility. What do you think, sir? Sounds like a good plan. He is a talented man who was top-rated at Yongchun. Hope he doesn't become Level 7 and move to City Hall. I'm happy where I am now. You scored 950? I'm impressed. When did I take it? It's got an expire date. "English Academy" It hasn't been two years yet, so you can still use it. What's it for? The civil service exam. The Level 7 civil exam? If you need a TOEIC score? I never blocked the path! You put a big sign and blocked it till just now! I did? When? Do you have proof? Do you? Look! Here's the proof! You broke the Outdoor-Advertisement Regulation! Oh, yeah! I broke a great law. I deserve to die. What? Ma'am! When will you stop? You can't do this to us... ...when we all struggle in this tiny market to make a living! Didn't you see the news about the electric shock accident, and kids getting hurt by standing signs? It's our civil duty to follow the law! Whatever! Young folks these days are out of their minds! What did you say! What about you? Know what they call you around here? What! Say it! -Spill it! -They call you... Damn! It's not worth it! Watch your mouth! Ramen should be cooked. I'm home. Good timing. Come here and eat. That's a lot of dumplings. What is this? Is this dumpling soup? The dumplings you ordered. You forgot to put in the freezer, so it all melted. Gotta eat 'em. Wash your hands. I'm not hungry. Right. Did you get your mock exam scores? Yup. I did. Why don't you show me? Showing you won't change anything. You better put it on my desk after you eat while I'm asking nicely. Remember we moved here for your schooling. Then we should've moved to a better neighborhood. We moved here for your work. The developer is going to court? It's an administrative order. The district office is doing some good for a change. The developer will do anything to win. I have evidence of them damaging the building. They kicked out tenants without security deposit payouts. I took pictures of everything. Hope this helps the court. The fate of the market family is at stake. Okay? We'll use your collected evidence. Thank you. Miss Sohn? Yes? Where do we keep unused files here? Unused files? How is the weather there? It's wonderful here. Well... I wanted to ask you about that. I think I wanna go a few days early. It's good news. Okay. I will check my schedule and get back to you. Good. Bye. Sorry. Your English is getting better. I'm jealous. I study everyday. So how's business going? Slowly. My alteration shop is small. It takes me so long to thread the needle now... ...as I'm getting old. So let's travel abroad before we get any older. Like the States. Enjoy your life. Travel? Don't try to fool me. You catch on too quickly. So how's business going? Why do you keep asking? It's going slowly. What's with you today? Here! What's wrong with me today? Hello? Geumjoo? I'm at the cafe down the street. Okay. Bye. Okboon? It doesn't cost anyway. Can't we meet up more regularly? Enough with that! Geumjoo wants to meet you too. Jungsim. I'm happy meeting you just for coffee like this. Stop it, okay? Fine. Enjoyed your meeting? We arrived in LA... ...after flying 12 hours over the Pacific. So that's LA? -Wassup. -Wassup. Welcome to LA. Wassup. Want some what? Wassup? Want some what? Wassup. Wassup. Wassup. Okboon? Geeze! What are you doing? What do you mean? Don't appear suddenly and touch me like that! You knew I came. You asked if I wanted some. I heard you. I said "wassup". It means, "How are you?" Learn some English. So silly. What for? It's useless for running a little store. Where's my jacket? What do you say? I reformed it well, huh? Not bad. Don't like it? -Then I'll just rip it up. -Of course I like it. It's cool like "wassup"! Thanks a lot. You're welcome. Bye bye, then. "Na Jungnam" Hello? Who is this? Is anybody there? Hello? That's a beautiful leather wallet but it costs too much. It means it's expensive. You go to a clothing store and see something you love. What do we say in English? I'm buying this? Good. Oh my god, I love it. Good. I will take it. Honey. Now. Can I try this on? How about this expression? Can I try this on. Ask if you can wear it. Can I try this on. Repeat after me. -Can I try... -Can I try... -...this on. -...this on. Good. Let's proceed to the next one. How about if the thing you love is really cheap? What do we say then? It's a steal. -Steal. -Steal. It means it's so cheap as if you're stealing it. -Okay. Good. -Miss Kim? Could you speak slowly? Slow down. Slow... Right. What was that again? What? What to say when it's damn cheap. Damn cheap? Like it's stealing? It's a steal. They teach English for free at town hall or the library. Classes for seniors. I went, but they didn't help. So I paid big money to learn here because it's not helping at all. Ma'am. There's nothing I can do this time. It's a toll on the others. I'm sorry. Hi, yeah. Why weren't you in class today? Sorry. I didn't tell you. I won't be taking conversational classes anymore. I am going to study on my own. Are you gonna stop? Well, you have mastered the advanced course. How about the simultaneous interpreter course? No. I've been studying here because I got something I wanna do. Let's hang out sometime. There are lots of great places to eat near my work. You know. Government employees recommend the best restaurants. Sounds good. Okay. -See you around. -Okay. Keep in touch. Wait! What is it? Teach me English? Pardon? I saw you with my eyes ramble on with the American back there. I attended here to learn English too. I know you finished the highest level, and you have nothing to improve. That's enough to teach me. Why do you want to learn English? Because I need to. I'm not asking for free lessons. I'll pay you well. Money's tight, right? How about a part-time job? -I'd like to tutor you, but... -What? I'm too busy with your pile of complaints, ma'am. I don't have any time for that. I'm sorry. "Please be my teacher" Jennifer? Ma'am. Please don't joke on a civil complaint form. But I am Jennifer. My teacher gave me that name at the English academy... ...because I needed one. Did you think it over? About what? Teaching me English. Keep going to the English Academy, Jennifer. Hello? It's Jennifer. Are you awake? Who? Jennifer? Yes! Jennifer! Goblin Gran... I mean, Granny Okboon? What time is it? How'd you get my number? It was listed on the emergency contacts for complaints. That's for the employees. You can't call me personally. Anyway, why'd you call? What else? Teach me English. -I'm sorry. I'm hanging up. -But... Damn it! What is she doing? I keep spilling. How is the weather this morning? Why is she doing that here? This morning. She practically lives here. I can't take it. I'd rather take complaints. How is the weather this morning? Ma'am? You're obstructing my duties. But I told you. And I told you I can't. Where are your manners? If an elderly begs you, at least pretend to think it over. That's a manner! Is staking out here like this good manners? You really can't teach me? No. I can't, ma'am. Fine. I smell trouble. Then I have no choice. No! -I'll be going then. -Take care, ma'am. Where are you going? To put in the complaints I collected before I go. You even collected complaints? Watch it. -Please! -I'm begging you, Mr Park! "English Alphabets for Children" Try writing this first. I have studied by myself for years. I know the alphabet. Really? Then... What's this? Don't think I know? It's a book. What kind of book? A wordbook. Dic... Dictionary? It's called a dictionary, right? That's an ordinary dictionary. But this is a much bigger resource book. What is it in English? One hundred dictionary? Encyclopedia. What? Encyclopedia. Ency... Do I have to know a big word like that? Isn't this a common word when you think of in Korean? Right. It's common. See? Encyclopedia is a basic word in English. Right? Memorize a list of words for tomorrow. If you pass the test, I'll teach you English. Ecology... It means 'Saeng-tae-hak'. What's that? Ecology... Ecology... What in the world is that? Ecology, latitude... Anthro... Anthropology. A-n-t-h-r-o-p... Spelling doesn't count, right? Write it out in Korean then. How nice of you. Anthropology. You got 75 percent. You did well. But it's less than the promised 80 percent. What's the word? It's too bad. Frustrated. I know that word! Could you count that to make it 80 percent? Sir? A promise is a promise. Bye. -Excuse me. -Yes? I'll have one to go, please. -One? -Yes. One soup to go, please! Why would I leave? I'm staying! Listen to me. This is what you call illegal. And we call you guys gangsters! I'm not a gangster. But if I was, I'd say this. You got one month. Pack up and leave by then. I'll be right here even after a month! We were here for 20 years! You can't kick me out, gangster! I'm not a gangster! It's your final notice. One month. Damn gangster punk! Hey, wait! Baldy! I'll get you! Baldy? Did you just call me that? I even have a kid, no one calls me Baldy. You're not going anywhere. Pick up your cigarette butt that you've just thrown away. Hey, stop! What now? Turn your head around and stop. Aren't you the fool who comes to pee on rainy nights? I only always stay home... ...on rainy nights listening to sad songs. You can't fool me anymore! Don't worry. Town office is going to court with them. I gave them evidence to... How rude! Domino's Pizza? How long will it take if I order now? Then I'll order. My address is Hyo-sung Building... Sorry, I'll call back. "Ok Alteration Shop" Geeze! It's you? I would never have guessed you two were brothers. Mr Park, you have a brother in high school? Dad got drunk and made a mistake. Why you... What? It's true. No, it's not. Come on. Eat up. -Thank you. -Sure. Try some, Mr Park. Okay. Thank you! "Ok Alteration Shop" Can't he skip tutoring for one night? Why send him off so soon? If he skips once, he'll keep skipping at that age. You're so uptight. Whatever you say. But why did you feed him? He was eating uncooked ramen. How poor. So I fed him a meal. Whenever I bumped into him, I told him to come and eat. It's lonely eating by myself. Thank you. Monday, Wednesday, Friday, three times a week, okay? Wherever it is good for you. What do you mean? I won't take money or else no lessons. Then, I'd feel bad. Instead... ...please feed my brother dinner sometimes. Then I'll feed him so well he could become a wrestler! -Move the food. -Sure. Today's Wednesday. Let's get started. No need to use difficult words. You can communicate with easy words. Then why'd you make me memorize all those hard words? Latitude, longitude, and ecology. Well... Then... ...shall we start our first class? Let's start with "How are you". -How are you? -Fine, thank you, and you? Good. What do you say to someone you haven't seen in a while? How have you been? How have you been? How have you... -Granny? -Yes? Don't write things down. Just speak whatever you hear. That's the only way to improve. Do not write. Do not write. "Jinju's Store" Here's to our first class! It's illegal to drink alcohol in the street like this. Wait. Why didn't you report this? Man... Why don't you report yourself? You're such a stickler. Let's go after this one drink. If you're 33, you could've had a son already. Why aren't you married yet? I missed my chance. You're like my grandmother who passed away. You must have grandkids around my age. No grandkids. I don't even have kids. Okboon? Here. Have some of this too. You shouldn't have. We'll go after this one cup. It's illegal to drink here. What? Since when? It's okay. You're drinking with me. -I'd like some too. -Sure. -You grew up in Busan? -Yes. Do you know that street tree? Street tree? It's in the middle of Busan between Bujeon and Jeonpo. No, you're wrong. The street tree is not there. Then where is it? In the shade... In the shade... In the Shade of the Street Tree? Lee Moonsae. Wow. I need to go. How old is he? Know where ginger is from? Ginger? Yup. Isn't that in the farm? Wrong. Then where? My hometown. How are you? I'm fine, thank you, and you? Good. I am going to get some coffee. It's too long. Whoever speaks Korean gets flicked in the forehead. Only in English, starting from now. Oh my god. Look who's winning? Oh, no. Oh, you just wasted your chance. I don't even have to look. No power. Baby. Baby. You got lucky this time. Lucky me. You see that! One move two goes down. Darn it! Urajil? Come on. -Why? -You spoke in Korean. Urajil is Korean. I'm going to get some coffee from the cafe. You want it too? I'd like some iced coffee. You meant iced coffee, right? Here you are. -Thanks a lot. -You're welcome. Bull's eye! No mercy this time. Are you crazy? You tried to make me angry, didn't you? What? What? Slowly? You did that on purpose. Right? I didn't understand. I mean, you hit me on purpose to make me mad! You spoke in Korean! You did! -You get a flick! -No, no. No way! Come here! I don't need the change Keep the change When your head hurts... I have a headache. -When you feel sad... -When you feel sad... -I feel blue -I feel blue Mr Park, thank you. When you meet in a while... How have you been? When you're busy... I call you back. When you say goodbye... See you later. It's no use just studying at a desk. You have to talk with native speakers. Really? Go talk to them in English. Really? It's an actual class. Talk to them for at least five minutes. Five minutes? -My name is Okboon Na. -Had I been 10 years younger. Okboon Na? Hi. I am Ryan Gosling. My hometown is Seosan, Chungcheong-do. I live in Bongwon Market. -Bongwon Market. -Bongwon Market. What are you doing in a bar like this? -What are you doing here? -She so cute though. Well, what is your job? What are you... -Long. -She's is really cute. -Long. -You are so... Alright, try over there. This time for 10 minutes. Okay. Oh. So the youngest is trying to actually write letters now so it's... Wassup. See there? A handsome boy there? -Yeah. -My jacket. Oh, lovely. English isn't so hard! Talking to them face to face really helps. And with you beside me, I don't feel scared. I can talk so easily and freely. One more beer! When my brother was young, I lived away from home for schooling. We started living together when he was in puberty. After I graduated and began studying abroad for graduate school. -Are you okay? -Yup. Maybe you drank too much. As soon as I left, my mom passed away. I rushed back to attend the funeral. When I left again, I didn't know what was going on at all. My father didn't want me to worry. So he didn't tell me. A year later, when he passed away, I learned the truth. Actually, I wanted to become an architect. I dreamt of designing masterpieces. But now... you see, I'm just a city official... ...who deals with building-related complaints. Your story is so sad. What? You understood everything? Well... I can tell by the tone of your voice. Happy Thanksgiving! What fool came up with this idea? Me. -The director complimented me. -Oh... Happy Thanksgiving! Hurray! Are you going anywhere during the holidays? No, I'll just sleep in. Right. Being single at our age, family gatherings aren't fun. They set me up on a few blind dates. Should I go or not? Should I go? Why are you asking me? You'll regret it. Hurray! Happy Thanksgiving! Come in. How are you? I'm fine, thank you, and you? Wait! Leave him. It's best to fry and eat it right off the pan. Gosh, it's hot. -It's hot! -It's good! Geez. But I don't like fish. Just stuff it in! Here. Wow! I never knew this would be this delicious! It's so good! Granny, one more. You have mature tastes now. Granny? Feed me too. Eat it yourself. The moon is huge and round! It's a full moon. Let's not make wishes on the moon. Granny. Why are you learning English? I have a younger brother. We were separated as kids. He lives in the States now. He doesn't speak Korean at all. Was he adopted away? I want to call him, but we can't communicate. I wonder how he's doing. If he's sick or not... How his kids are doing... There are so many things I'm so curious about. That's why I'm learning English. I need to use the toilet. "Na Jungnam" We can't just sit and watch. Let's make wishes on the moon. Sis! Jungnam! I'll bake potatoes for you at home. I'm calling from Korea. Are you Okboon's younger brother by any chance? -Korea? Hold on a sec. -Okay. Hello? Who are you? Hi I'm Okboon's English teacher. She's learning English to speak to you. So... Okboon? I'm sorry. I don't want to speak to her. I didn't wish to speak to her before. I won't have anything to say. Please don't call here again. And tell her I don't remember her. Hello? "Lifespan 75 seconds" Going up the stairs... Why does it decrease life expectancy? "Decrease 165 seconds Decrease 150 seconds" -The arrows are on backwards. -Oops. Just leave 'em. No one will know. "Come earlier for dinner Granny Okboon" Not hungry? Let's stop learning English. What the hell do you mean? Well, I have to take the Level 7 exam soon and all. I'll be very busy every day. I see. How about once or twice a week? And let me pay for the lessons. You insisted that you won't get paid, but I felt bad for not paying you. I'm really sorry. How are you? I'd better get going. I'm sorry. Okboon. Are you okay? She must be your friend! The one you talk about all the time? Yes. My best friend. Right. Best friend. I'm sorry I'm like this. Don't say that. If you are sorry, just get better and back up again. My memory comes and goes. I'm not well. Remember this? Of course. How could I ever forget this? Jungsim. Why are you so sick all of a sudden? It's me who's sick why are you crying? Don't cry. Just like the past... You're still full of tears. Granny? Granny Jungsim... It'll be hard for her now. It's processing so fast, in a few months, she may not even remember her name. So I'm asking, could you help, Granny Okboon? Would it be hard? Or would you just do it for Granny Jungsim? It's your best friend's final wish. What school do you go to? I swear I didn't know, sir! I'm serious! If you were confused, you should've checked his ID. Of course I did, sir. First, there were three of them. But suddenly, there were four. I was busy running the shop alone without any part timer. -Ma'am. -Yes? Whatsoever, you sold beer to a minor. Right? -Let's go to the station. -It's so unfair! -It was you. -What? You reported that I sold beer to a minor, didn't you! That's impossible! Why would I do such a thing? Who else would do that around this market? Yeah? -What? Who do you think I am! -Let's go. A crazy woman! Always going around looking for something to report! Get in. -Get in! -Granny! You'll pay for this. -Back off, ma'am. -Wait! Not teaching English to Granny these days? No. Stuff happened. A new restaurant opened up. Go buy dinner there from now on. Did you bring your documents? I'll take those. Great. "Minjae Park" Damn. Look at them! The officials shouldn't be illegally smoking here! I stayed low too long. Those fools! I heard from the headquarter that Yelim Construction sued your department. What if you get reprimanded? It's all a setup. We'll lose and put an end to the market people's complaints. We can say we did our best. Then Yelim can redevelop it. It's a win-win deal. What are you talking about? What do you mean it's a setup? I was talking about the real setup card game. I heard you talking about our market redevelopment. What the hell did you mean? Well, if you heard everything... We can't prove the developer caused damages to the building. Please consider us spending a lot of money for this court... ...that we will obviously lose, Granny. Think you can fool me! Please stop! They own it and they can do whatever they want! Give back the evidence that I provided! Pardon? The evidence I said to use in the lawsuit. The pictures of the developer pouring acid to ruin the building! Look through Mr Park's desk. I think it was shredded. Shredded? It's gone? Yes. You did it? Well, not really. Tell Mr Park to come! I'm almost there. -What do you mean? -I didn't know. It's all shredded? Where's Mr Park! You said it's unused. I meant for it to be kept in storage. You dare lie to me! It's an administrative process. I had no option. But don't worry about your shop. Only the stores across from you will be redeveloped. Do you think I collected that for years just for me? The pork shop girl is supporting her mom all by herself... ...while working early in the morning without having no dates! If she gets kicked out, what will she do? Granny Okboon. No one cares that you go around reporting things for them. Worry about yourself. No one's thankful for that! I'm not doing it to be thanked. It's where I live and they are my neighborhood! How could you lie to me! I didn't mean to, but I guess I lied. I'm sorry. Sorry? Is that why you taught me English? That's right. I did it on purpose out of guilt! I felt bad for you! And one more thing. No need for you to learn English. I called your brother. He doesn't want to talk to you. Or meet you. He doesn't even want to remember you. And he can't! So there's no need for you to struggle to learn English now! You lie! -Ma'am! Are you okay? -Are you alright? -Granny? -Are you all right? "Temporarily Closed" Where did she go? Did you just smoke? -Hey! -What? I'm stressed out. Can't you just let it go? What's with you? What's with you acting like an old man? I'm your guardian. Right. You're my guardian. So you gave up your dreams to support me. Got a problem with me? Youngjae! Do you know why she meddles in everyone's lives? Because she's lonely. She lived her whole life alone without any family. How could you do that to her? "Na Okboon" "Registration for Complaint" Wait! Please! How can you shut down my store with only one-month notice, Please hear me out. That's why you should've sold it to us before. I even reported you to close the store. It was you? Why not cooperate sooner? Damn bastards! Hey! Oh, my gosh! Are you okay? Oh no! Stop it! Tell the boys to destroy this place. Everyone stop! Who are you? I'm from the district office. Nice to meet you! I tried to handle this on our own without bothering you. We are regular employees of Yelim. What's external support? We support things externally? She's on a private property illegally. No, I'm not. It's my store. My store! She doesn't own it. The lawsuit is still pending. Interrupting a business like this is illegal, even if this property belongs to you. -That's right! -Yeah. A lawsuit? The lawsuit was your idea from the first. I said there's a way. I didn't say to do it. Sneaky fool! If you do this, the director will lose out. That's none of my concern. I'm sorry. Let's act like civil officials. What's our creed? Stay low. Be indifferent. Stay low, you'll be doing okay. So I'm just standing by. "Warning: Forced Removal Prohibited" "The intruder will be sentenced..." -Be the next director! -No. Take care. Thank you very much. -I didn't do anything. -Come on. Take care. "Temporarily Closed" How are you? How are you, Jungsim? You gnashed your teeth till you lost them all. Get up Jungsim. You said you'll live long and bring them to their knees! You saved me from dying. You should be healthier! She doesn't recognize me now. How could she forget that of all things? A few days ago, she suddenly got better for a while, and she wrote this to give you. Hello, ma'am. Granny Na Okboon, right? Yes. That's me. Who are you? You can't just barge in here. I didn't tell her anything yet. That's why I came. I came to ask her myself. No. We haven't discussed it yet. Come on, Geumjoo. But it's all been decided. We need to go through this anyway. Yes, but not like this. -Look. -Please leave. What are you two talking about? Granny. I'll explain later. Hello, ma'am. I'm a reporter Choi Hyunwook for Fair News. But I came as a member of the HR 121 coalition, not as a reporter. It was formed by human rights groups wanting the US House... ...to pass Resolution 121. Resolution 121 is all about the wrongdoing done by Japanese... Reporter Choi! Give her some time, please. Let him talk. I'm done hiding anymore. Jinju! -Jinju! -What? -See this? -What is it? "'Comfort Women' Hearing to be Held'" My name is Na Okboon. -In 1943, when I was 13... -Did you know, Mr Park? "Youngjae" Mom? I was going to hide it till the day I die. I promised that with you. But I can't keep the promise. No, I won't keep it. More than you, Jungsim... More than Jungsim, I'm more important. Mom? Why'd you do it. Why'd you blame me? Afraid I'd hold your son back, you kept quiet. How could I live well when my family abandoned me? "My poor girl. It must've hurt!" That was all I needed! Just once! Mom! Mom... Mom... Did you eat? I was away for a few days, so I have no food. -I'll cook, wait here. -I'm sorry, Granny. I'm so sorry. What do you have to be sorry for? I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. It's a memory I want to forget. But I didn't throw that away. If I forget, I'd be losing. I didn't show it to anyone for over 60 years. Showing it to you... ...makes me feel somewhat better. Jungsim... She saved my life. It's my turn! I waited a long time. I'm not done yet! It's not finished. Help me! I'll draw it nicely! Draw the Rising Sun flag, sir. Please stop! Shut up! Okboon! Okboon, wake up! Okboon! Why won't you let me die! Can't I even choose to die? Can't I even end my own life at will? How can I survive without you? Why can't I do it like you? I'll make one for you too. -Really? -Yup. Let's wipe our tears away on this and cheer up. Okay? Promise. Jungsim... She went around everywhere to testify what happened. Once, she went to Nagoya. The interpreter said we crawled in... ...because we wanted to eat rice. He translated it all wrong! After that, Jungsim studied English like hell. She wanted to tell the whole world what we went through. She wrote that for the hearing. From a few years ago, Jungsim started losing her memory. I think I knew then, that someday I'll have to do it instead. That's why I studied English. Mr Park. Would you help me one last time? Wait, Jinju! Jinju! Why do you keep avoiding me? I did not. See! You're avoiding my eyes. Don't want to be friends because of my tough past? That's crazy. You pretend not to see me! It's because I was hurt. I'm hurt! I got sick because I'm so hurt! You know how mad I was at you for the past few days? We were friends for years. But... You never told me anything. If you told me, I would've done anything to help. You couldn't trust me? Do I look like a half-wit who wouldn't understand? Of course not! You're my dearest friend. Then why'd you do it? You must've been in so much pain. You flinched when anyone touched you... That's why... I had no idea... I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. How could you? Why didn't you tell me? All those years alone... It must've been so hard. It must've hurt so much. My poor, dear friend. Ready, ma'am? I'm ready. I'll take your picture now. Smile, please? No? I'll just take it. Nice picture. I'm here to tell you the truth. When Japanese soldiers committed prime. Committed crime... Committed crime. Against humanity. And I stand here on behalf of them... ...to carry your heavy burden of history. What's this? "Okboon, I didn't know anything and I only hated you. I'm sorry." "Please have a safe trip -Hyejung- Take this money for your trip." Presents for your US trip. This is the herbal soup from the sashimi store. This is the medicine from the dried foods. This is the inner wear from the noodle shop. What? They're all for you. Why did you let me? Look at this. What's that? I made it for you to wear to your interview. You did? When I was young, I wanted to run a tailor shop. Wow! Take that off and try it on. It's not mixed, made of 100 percent wool. The best fabric there is. What do you think? It fits you perfectly. -Really? -Yup. Geumjoo? Yes, Granny? How far is LA from here? Los Angeles? No, LA. Right, LA. It's about four to five hours by plane. Why? Do you know someone there? No. Just curious. You'll be transferred elsewhere if you become level 7, right? How much is your raise? Nothing's decided. I have to pass my interview first. I knew you wouldn't stay long... ...since I first met you. So I didn't open my heart. If I had, you would've given up on the Level 7 exam. Forgive me for acting cold for your future. What do you mean? Just thought I should say it. Terrible newsflash. The comfort women hearing supposed to be held in Washington, is in danger of being canceled. The Japanese has questioned the qualifications of the witnesses. Granny Na Okboon is among those they are questioning, and people are more concerned. Bastards. Of course they would do this. I knew they would do this. This is our mistake. We should've prepared everything. I'll discuss measures with Congressman Michael Lee. Granny, what happened? Jungsim told me to apply a dozen times. Because I didn't, it's a problem. Apply for what? The verification procedure for comfort women. I wanted to hide it and didn't do it. So there's no proof that I was a comfort woman. Since my country can't prove it... they say I can't testify at the hearing. That's crazy! I ruined everything because of my damn pride. Listen up, everyone! -This isn't like him at all. -I need your help! Please help Granny Na Okboon! Please sign the petition. Here too. Please write, "Help Granny Na Okboon". This is the petition for the hearing. Could you sign to help verify the comfort women victims? Hello. Please read this. Thank you. Hello. Please read this. Director? What in the world? Why are you here during work hours? What? It's all a part of my job. I'm not signing. Stop bothering me. But it's for your own good, sir. Verifying Granny Na as a comfort woman is a national issue. It'll be approved eventually. The question is, who's going to do it. Congress? Mayor of Seoul? Minister of Gender Equality? They're all looking to resolve it and be noticed. Director, you can pass it and receive the spotlight with a great impact? Not so bad, is it? Will you pass up the chance of a lifetime? "Mayor of Seoul" "Minister of Gender Equality" "You can do it." I see you're a Level 9 official. You passed the Level 7 exam? Yes. You just have one brother in high school? Yes, I only have... No. There's one more. "Level 7 Second Round Interviews" "Japan Rejects Na Okboon's Comfort Woman Verification" "Japan Demands Hard Evidence" We want justice! Jungsim... I can do this, right? Granny, here. We will now begin the hearing... ...for the adoption of the apology resolution, for Japanese military sexual slavery, known to the world as comfort women. Tens of Japanese soldiers stood in line in front of the room. Every day. It was a same terror. Over and over again. I thought... ...if I looked ugly, the men wouldn't want me anymore. So I cut off all of my hair. She cut off all her hair. But it only made me an object of curiosity. The Japanese government has maintained... ...that comfort women were voluntarily recruited from civilians. Did you perhaps choose to work as a comfort woman... ...for money? Stupid question. My dream was to become a nun. Why then would I have pursued the path of prostitution? According to documents submitted by Japan, they state that at the time, comfort women were treated better than Japanese military officers. That's ridiculous! They considered me less than a dog. They beat me! They locked me up. What little money they did give us... ...they cheated us out of it under one pretext or another. Oh, Michelle... We will move on. Next the testimony of Na Okboon will commence. Your testimony will begin. -Are you ready? -Are you ready? Madam Speaker. It is my understanding that Na Okboon's status... ...as a comfort woman has not been verified yet. And I'd like to raise my doubts, as to the credibility of a document that was thrown together... ...in just mere days. We shall go ahead and hear the testimony, and then the House will make a determination... ...as to the official merits of the document. Madam speaker. We cannot acknowledge a document that wasn't presented with clear-cut evidence. Na Okboon! You're not a comfort woman! You have no right to testify. We don't want your false testimony. Na Okboon... Will you testify? Will you testify? Yes. I can speak. Are you ready? Yeah, she can speak. How are you? How are you? I'm fine. -How are you, Okboon? -No, sir. Back up, sir. I'm fine, thank you, and you? He is our member. Okay? Japanese soldiers carved these on me with knives. Japanese soldiers carved these on me with knives. These are scars and scribbles that the Japanese soldiers... ...carved on my body with knives. My body is covered with such scars. Every time I see these scars... ...the hellish memories come alive again. No evidence, you say? I'm the evidence! Michelle, here, and all survivors are the evidence. When I suffered hell like that... ...I was only 13. Thirteen. I was unable to die. I missed my home, and waited it out to see my family. I am standing here today... ...for those young girls. Their childhoods were stolen away... ...by the crimes of the Japanese army. We must remember those girls... ...and the pain that they lived through. Japan committed crimes against humanity. But there has been no sincere apology... ...for the comfort women issue. Let me be perfectly clear. We were threatened and forced into... ...being sex slaves for the Japanese army. We have lived our entire lives in torment... ...because of those memories of hell. But Japan's arrogant attitude... ...as they avoid responsibility, gives us more pain and anger. We are not asking for too much. Just for you to acknowledge your wrongdoings. We are giving you the chance to ask for our forgiveness... ...while we are still alive. I am sorry. Is that so hard? If you don't want to leave a heavy burden... ...on your future generations, then apologize before it is too late. And I ask this of all of you. Please remember... ...the history into which we were forced. This must be remembered. For such history... ...must not be... ...repeated again. You did a good job ma'am. I was very touched. Thank you. It was a moving speech. This way. Okboon. I am very sorry. I am sorry. I am so sorry. You are strong. I admire you. Thank you for your courage. It was incredible sharing your pain. Sorry for your dream. You are so brave. This way. Okboon! How much money are you hoping to get to go through all this trouble? Bastard... You crazy bastards! Minjae! No, stop! Are you stupid? I don't need your filthy money! Acknowledge it and apologize. You shameless fools! You're making a big mistake right now. I don't care. Granny! Not that. Calm down. Calm down. You skipped work to come here? Without you, there's not much to do anyway. Thank you so much. I couldn't have spoken without you. You were great. Granny? -Let's go to the waiting room. -Sure. This way. He came from LA to see you. My sister. Okboon. Tom? Are you Jungnam? How'd you come here? Oh, my! How did you come here? I saw you in the newspaper. And that man calling me, called me all the time. Thank you. Thank you so much for coming. I miss you. I miss you, Jungnam. I missed you, sister. I'm so sorry for everything. I really am. I'm so sorry. Oh, Jungnam! I was the one who did wrong, sister. I was the one who hurt you. -I'm sorry. -Sorry? Oh, Jungnam! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. "The 'Comfort Women' Resolution HR 121" "was passed unanimously on July 30th, 2007" "It was the comfort women's first victory" "against the Japanese government" "Ten years later, Japan has yet to apologize." -Hello. -Hi. Hello. -Hello, Granny. -Hi. I told you to put that out at night! You don't listen! -Okay, okay. -Not again! Good morning, ma'am. Grow up. You're going to San Francisco next week? Yup. I'm speaking at the city council. Saw the news? Abe is talking bullshit again! But his ratings went up even more. Damn it! Granny. Slow down. Think of your age. The Japanese are waiting for us to die out. They should watch me, I'll live till I'm 200! Come on, Mr Park! Granny, I'm Level 7 now. It's a chief now. I'm Chief Park. Chief Park? Forget that. I'll just call you Minjae. Let's go. Thank you. Wow. You've traveled a lot. Yup. Do you speak English? Of course. "I Can Speak"
