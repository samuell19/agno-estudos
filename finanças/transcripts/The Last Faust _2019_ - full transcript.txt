Turn the light on This is my mothers house, untouched since she died, and unconnected to any modern form of technology. We should be safe here. Are you ready to record? Ready (TECHNICAL SOUND) Good Good evening, and welcome to the end of the world. My world. My name is Anton Goodfellow, Dr. Goodfellow. I am CEO of Winestone Inc. Where I succeeded Dr Faust. And I will be your host during this short presentation on how my species managed to systematically destroy itself, expertly assisted of course by my machine learning friend here. Introduce yourself. C02JK0TVDTY4Z-2... 27 C02JK0TVDTY4Z-2... 27 But I like to call him Paris. I have no idea if anyone will ever actually see this, but we live in hope. Context. Yes, of course. Would you mind checking the replay? Dr.Goodfellow. I am CEO von Winestone Inc. Where I succeeded Dr Faust. Good. Let the macabre theater begin. Dr. Faust was the head of one company Winestone Inc., the largest tech-company in Silicon Valley Whose main area of expertise was artificial intelligence But Dr. Faust has also mastered the art of moving between certain points in time and space time travel Yes, time travel However, what Faust really wanted to create was the world's first super human to outdo God's creation, a feat that man has dreamed about since he first gazed up at the sky many millennia ago. Let us go back to before it was rotten, and meet the perpetrators who set this in motion. We have before us God and Mephisto. Now Mephisto has seen too much of humanity, he thinks of mortals as easily corruptible, easily conquered, and easily swayed. We may have reason and intelligence but we are still not happy. But God, does not agree. Earth's little god's shaped out the same old clay, The mortal is the same queer fish he was on the first day. He'd be much better off, in my opinion, without the bit of heavenly light you dealt him out. Is that all you can do, criticize eternally? Is nothing ever right for you down there sir? No, nothing, Lord - all's just as bad as ever. Do you know Faust? The Doctor? My good servant! If today his service seems confused, disordered, He will with my help see the way clear forward. Would you care to bet on that? You'll lose, I promise you. If you'll give me leave to lead the fellow down my broad, my primrose path. As long as Faustus walks the earth I shan't, I promise, interfere. Well thank you, Lord it's not the dead and gone that I like dealing with. I much prefer are round and rosy cheeks. Well... Yet I'll seduce him from it soon enough. I'm not afraid I'll lose my bet. And when I have won, You won't, I trust, begrudge my shouts of triumph, cry of victory I do not hate your likes much I find of all the spirits of denial, You jeerers not my severest trial. Man's very quick to slacken in his efforts, What he likes best is Sunday peace and quite So I'm glad to give him a devil for his own good, To prod and poke and incite him as a devil should. So we go from heaven to Silicon Valley, and here we find our exceptionally intellectual and learned friend Dr Faust. Although he has revolutionised the world, he is demoralised, for he is no closer to constructing his Superhuman. He may have mastered the traditional and conventional modes of thought, but that cannot help him to understand all the numerous and varied phenomena of life and nature. He is too human, he cannot separate consciousness and existence. Who's telling this story? We are! Good point. How hard I've slaved away, With what result? Poor foolish old man, I'm no whit wiser than when I began! Which is why I turned to magic So I may penetrate the power That holds the universe together. Who is calling? You're Faust? The one who at my breath's Least touch, shudders to his depths, A thing that wriggles off, scared, a worm! I'm him, yes Faust, your equal, the same. You equal the spirit you think I am, Not me! Not you? Then who? Me, made in God's own image, Not even equal to you? Faust's second in command is Wagner. Chief Principal Scientist of Winestone Inc. And head of the A.I. research program. Parchment, tell me that's the sacred fount you drink out of. To slake your eternal thirst? The only true refreshment that exists you get from where? Yourself - where all things start. What you call an age's spirit, What is it? Nothing but your own poor spirit If only I had wings to rise into the air and follow ever after! I don't really envy birds their wings. How different are the pleasures of the intellect Sustaining one from page to page, from book to book, And goodness, when you spread out an old parchment, Heaven's fetched straight down into your study. You know the one great driving force, May you never know the other! Two souls live in me, alas, Irreconcilable with one another. One lusting for the world with all its might, Grapples it close, greedy of all its pleasures, The other rises up, up from the dirt, Up to the blest fields where dwell our great forbears. You really are a dusty old stick. Faust is dejected, disheartened, deeply depressed. He retires to his room, draws a bath, his soul heavy in the assumed knowledge that he will never gain the access he needs to mimic and outdo God's creation. I'm no God, only too well do I know it! A worm's what I am, wriggling through the soot Vial, I salute you, And reverently bring you down from the shelf, Honoring in you man's craft and cunning Quintessence of easeful sleeping potions, Pure distillation of subtle poisons, Do your master the kindness that lies in your power! What deep-sounding burden, what tremelo strain arrest the glass before I can drink? Christ is arisen! Blest is the man of love, He who the anguishing, Bitter, exacting test, Salvation bringing, passed. But why do you seek me out in the dust, You music of Heaven, mild and magnificient Your message is clear but it leaves me indifferent. And where belief's lacking no miracle possible. Your song gave the signal for the games we all joined in When the springtime arrived with its gay festival, Innocent childhood remembered emotion Holds me back from the final step O sound away, sound away sweet songs of Heaven, The earth claims me again, my tears well up, fall! God in all his infinite wisdom has intervened in Faust's suicide attempt. He saved his life through an angel. So he can win a bet. Faust attends a folk festival, a large celebration amongst his peers and some less noble types, where he is idolised for his many contributions to society. Now face about and looking down from the hilltop to town, See the brightly coloured crowd pouring like a spring floud But by myself I'd never come near here, for I can't abide the least vulgarity, The fiddling, shrieking, clashing bowls, for me are all an unbearable uproar What gratification must be yours to win such popular applause. Don't you see that white dog in the stubble coursing back and forth? Look again. What kind of creature is it? Faust's keen eye allows him to detect something is not quite right about this creature, that this creature is not the creature it presents itself to be. The masquerade is quickly revealed. Why all the racket? What's your wish, sir? So it's you who was the poodle! And what's your name? A humble part of that great power which always means evil, always does good. And havoc and ruin all you call evil, in sum For me's the element in which I swim. To Faust it seems he has accidentally invoked the devil A devil who lay in plain site waiting to be recognised. Indeed. Good automaton. And he speaks to Faust in the language of power, for the skin Mephisto walks in is that of a Hedge Fund Technology Manager for Winestone Inc, with a controlling share in the company. And so he immediately proposes a deal, he will assist Faust in his quest for divine knowledge by granting him access to the secrets of creation, as well as the resources in which to create. But in return he wants access to all digital data Faust has on mortals A strange request. Seemingly yes, but information is power, and like God, Mephisto wants to use all advantages at hand to win the bet, however unlike God, he also wants to have some fun along the way. It is my greatest pleasure to announce the pact, the CEO of Winestone Inc. And Mephisto, a man who needs no introduction I promise, I will serve your wishes - here A slave who does your bidding faithfully But if we meet each other - there, Why, you must do the same for me. If you ever see me loll at ease, Then it's all yours, you can have it, my life! If ever you fool me with flatteries Into feeling satisfied with myself, Or tempt me visions of luxuries, That's it, the last day that I breathe this air, I'll bet you! Done! A bet! A bet! I swear! Mephisto decides to take Faust to Berghain. Berghain, a nightclub in Berlin, Germany named after its location near the border between Kreuzberg and Friedrichshain. Associated with decadence and hedonism. After all, one cannot know the secrets of the universe without knowing both the joys of good and the delights of evil, and one cannot know or understand God without this knowledge and true knowledge can only be gotten from experience. Plus Mephisto probably thought Faust could do with unwinding a little. And now where to? Wherever you like. First we'll mix with little people. Then with great. The pleasure and the profits you will get from our course and never pay tuition for it. By air's how we make our departure, you enjoy the voyage. If we're light enough we'll lift right up quickly off the face of earth These dolts can't ever recognize Old Nick even when he's got them by the neck. Simple pleasures cannot satisfy Faust's needs, and so Mephisto takes him to see a witch. She promises to rejuvenate him. Why, it's revolting all this crazy witchery! Are you telling me that I'll be born a new man here amid this lunatic confusion? The witch offers him an elixir, and it brings forth a vision What do I see? What a marvellous vision shows itself in this magic glass! Woman unrivalled, beauty absolute! Can such things be, a creature made perfectly? The body so indolently stretched out there surely epitomizes all that is heavenly. One more look in the mirror, let me! That woman was inexpressibly lovely! No, no, soon enough, before you, vis-à-vis, Yours! The fairest of fair women, I guarantee. With that stuff in him, old Jack will Soon see Helen in every Jill. Faust returns to work with the best intentions, to focus on his guest to create his superhuman, however his baser instincts have now been... aroused, and he can't help but notice 16 year old Gretchen. Innocent and pure. And the companies receptionist. Pretty lady, here's my arm, Would you allow me to see you home? I'm neither pretty nor a lady, Can find my way home quite unaided "If I don't hold that darling creature tight in my arms this very night," We're through, we two, come twelve midnight. Faust is, for the first time, infected by his power and our chaste Gretchen is awarded an unexpected promotion as his new PA. He did love her, you know. Eventually, his lust evolved to love. An innocent mind not driven by the mental turmoils of wanting to know everything, her virtues could have saved him and yet... here we are. Loves me - loves me not- Loves me Dearest, yes! Yes, let the flowers be, the oracle by which the truth is said. He loves you... Shall we never pass a quiet time alone together, Breast pressed to breast, our two beings one? Oh if I only slept alone! I'd draw the bolt for you tonight, yes gladly But my mother sleeps so lightly, And if we were surprised by her I know I'd die right then and there. Darling, there's no need to worry, Here's a vial three drops only In her cup will subdue nature and lull her into pleasant slumber. Well, tell me, you must, about your religion - how do you feel? You're such a good man, kind and intelligent, Yet I suspect you are indifferent. Enough of that, you know quite well I cherish you so very dearly! Mephisto's sleeping drought has killed Gretchen's mother, and Gretchen's brother, a vengeful boy with no Devil on his side, attempts to kill Faust in revenge for the destruction of his sisters innocence. He does not succeed, and Mephisto and Faust have no choice but to kill him. Who's lying here? Your mother's son My God, the misery, on and on. Do you pray for the soul of your mother Who through you slept on and still on into pain and more pain? The blessed avert their faces from you. Pure souls with a shudder snatch their hands back from you. Poor thing! Faust and Mephisto escape the crime scene unnoticed and What of Gretchen? She takes the blame for the death of her mother and brother and is imprisoned. Things get out of hand sometimes We have to keep moving towards our goal. (HELICOPTER AND WAR SOUND) Like Faust. (HELICOPTER AND WAR SOUND) Mephisto takes him to the Brocken mountain, a bacchanal of music and carnal lust. A place to forget. A place to collapse into permanent degradation. There Urian mounts his throne. So over stock and stone go stumping, Witches farting, billy goats stinking! (LAUGHING) Look over there, At that lovely girl, pale-faced with fear, standing by herself. How laborously she pushes herself forwards, wracked with pains, as if her feet were shackled tight in chains. I must confess, it looks like Gretchen. Medusa, did you ever hear of her? Yes, yes, those are a corpse's eyes no loving hand was by to close. But vices can only be distracting for so long, and Faust's humanity is not lost. Overtaken by a moral fever, he tries to free Gretchen from her cell. But it is too late. She was with child. Oh this is to tragic for my taste Only let me nurse the baby first, All night long, I hugged the dear creature How mean they were, snatched it from my breast, And now they say I murdered it I'll never be happy, no never again. Oh the cold lips you have, Cold and dumb. What become of your love, All gone? Who stole it from me? So Mephisto has not yet won his bet with God, it has being upheld by Faust's sudden, if not ill thought out, plan to save Gretchen. But Faust is not satisfied, he hasn't sourced the seeds of creation and he still has a devil on his shoulder. And so the guilt drip, drip, drips down, his heart becomes leaden, weighed down by the consequences of his actions. And his despair is like a siren, which attracts the attentions of his competitive God. Who doesn't like to lose a bet. And so God decides again to send him an angel, this time to purify his soul, absolving him off his sins. He is born anew. He is forgiven. How comforting that must feel. Ameliorate the cruel Strife in his heart, pluck out self-condemnation's burning dart And wash his soul clean of the horror and fright. Life pulses in me with a quickened beat, Welcoming the dawn's eternal light And you, Earth, too stood steadfast through the night And now breath with new vigour at my feet, filling me with so much pleasure, Firing me with a purpose I'll never forswear To strive after highest existence always Oh no! The infallible God failed. The end of humanity is imminent! It's only me. Oh god, I can see it is you Who else could it be but you? Of course its you! I had such a nightmare. Oh god, god what a nightmare it was terrible, terrible! I saw Faust's protecting angel fall from the sky and crash onto the Earth. She was crucified on the cross. It shows that God's power is dwindling. We are running out of time. Let us continue! And now we must... move our gaze to the Emperor of the Northern Empire. Nearly caused financial bankruptcy by lowering taxes, whilst increasing government spendings and initiating global protectionism. And he needs someone to clean up this mess. And who better then his newly enlisted Chairman of the Federal Reserve Mephisto, and Chief scientific advisor to the Northern Empire Dr Faust. So Mephisto, a cunning economic mind, when it comes to short term gain anyway, drives interest rates to zero and prints more money. The economy sharply - Temporarily! Recovers. He's Plutus, he is God of Wealth! Come here himself in all his pompery, The Emperor needs him urgently. Paper money, unlike gold and silver Says what it's worth on its face, it doesn't require Endless haggling before a person can, If he so wishes, indulge in love and wine. (MEPHISTO LAUGHING) Faust, in his newly minted position, presents the Emperor with his plan for creating the first Superhuman, and the Emperor, is intrigued he wants to build, rather then breed, a race modelled after his own idea of aesthetic perfection. He wants flawless Gods. Using the technology granted to him by Mephisto, Faust searches throughout history, dimensions, realms for this ideal, and finally he comes across Helena of Troy. Said to be the most beautiful woman in the world, married to King Menelaus of Sparta, but abducted by Prince Paris of Troy, resulting in the Trojan War. And he is captivated by their good old fashioned mathematical beauty We are modelled after the golden ratio. Natures symmetry. Is that why you call me Paris? Don't be so vain... I'm at my wits'end, don't know what to do The Chamberlain insists, the Steward, too Produce at once, before the Emperor, Helen and Paris as in life they were, The very paragon of women, she, Of men the very beau ideal, he. Those old pagans are none of my business. They've got their own Hell, not at all like ours is. Still, there's a way. The key will sniff out where you want to go and lead you to the Mothers. A glowing tripod, when you see it, means You've reached the bottom most, deepest depth of things, By the light it casts you'll see the Mothers, Approach the tripod, never hesitate, And touch it with the key. Up, up you rise, be brought back to us here before they even notice. Once back, summon from out of the night the hero and heroine Excuse me, but from what I've seen, I'd say the Rape of Helen is the title of this play. Rape! I'm nothing here? Rape, if you please! Don't you see this key still in my hand! So far away once, could she now be closer? If I rescue her she's mine twice over. Then risk it! Mothers, Mothers, let me have her! When once you've seen her you can't live without her! But Dr Faust forgets himself, as scientists we observe and we do not interfere no matter how tantalising the subject may be. And now his soul is afflicted. He is brought to his laboratory by Mephisto, where Wagner is working on Homunculus. Yes. The first Superhuman. Your ancestor as such. The personification of intellect but without all those pesky human emotions. He's rudimentary. That's because to complete his existence, upgrade him if you will, they must travel to the Greek Underworld and seek Proteus the old man of the sea, who has the final vital ingredient to make Homunculus a real boy. What of Faust? His unfortunate condition can only be fixed by Helena. And so Homunculus already pulling his weight, reprograms Faust's time loop, and away they go. A man's creation. No! Have you two lovers snugly tucked up there inside that chimney? God forbid! Our ancient mode of breeding we now pronounce a clownish, coarse proceeding. To make out of the mixture human matter Then sealing up in a limbec carefully, We redistill the contents thoroughly, To find at least all's been accomplished quietly. I see the delicate outline within of something gesturing, a manikin! It's brother Rascal, am I right? You'ver come, I must say, very opportunely. You've got to move him elsewhere. Just now it has occurred to me That by a very happy chance It's classical Walpurgis Night Just his element, for him just right. The northwest, Satan is your stamping ground, The southeast's the direction we are bound. Through a great plain, through thicket and through grove, Peneios flows along still, sultry reaches, The plain extends back to the mountain gorges, And old and new Pharsalus lie above. Fetch the cloak and wrap our knight up in it! The rag will bear you both, it's always done it. In the end we are dependent on the very creatures we ourselves created. And so Homunculus already pulling his weight, reprograms Faust's time loop, and away they go. My mother's revolver... Ready... They arrive on a magical evening, that of Classic Walpurgis Night, a night where all Greek heroes, majestic creatures and Gods joyously come together to celebrate that which unites them. And in a breath You'll see life returning to him Here miraculously I'm in Greece! Standing here, at once I knew the place, A fresh spirit coursed again through me, Roused the sleeper, Antaeus-like, with its warmth. Our intrepid travellers split up, Dr Faust, still afflicted by his spell searches for his Helena. He seeks her from all manner of beasts, but is answered only by one, Chiron. You've been taken in... For women in mythology enjoy a special grace The poet shows them as his tale requires. They never need endure a wrinkled face, They keep their slim attractive figures carried off in youth, by crowds of suitors still pursued in age. But to us spirits you look like a madman. Now as it happens you're in luck today I briefly visit Manto annually, Remain with her for awhile, I feel assured that with herbs you'll be completely cured. Keep your cures, my mind's in perfect order She'd make me like the rest, ignoble, vulgar. So Chiron takes him across the river Peneios to Manto, who can guide him to the entrance of Olympus, where he can meet with Persephone Goddess of the underworld and wife of Hades, who has the power to curse mortals as well as break curses already placed on them. Manto tells him that the only way to break the curse is to ask Helena, the most beautiful woman in known history, for her hand in marriage. What a chore for Faust. I love who wish impossibilities. Foolhardy fellow, enter and rejoice! This passage follows a descending course into Olympus's hollow foot. And what of our tricky Devil, Mephisto? Our playful unscrupulous murderer? Well, whilst Faust seeks beauty he seeks ugliness, and is with the Lamia Lamia, mistress of Zeus, turned into a monster by Hera. Beautiful from the front, hideous from behind. And desperate, they amuse our Devil. I know how to handle Northern witches, but these foreign ones give me twitches. Come, around our hero, dance. Love, we feel sure, shall announce itself in him for one of us. The prettiest is the one I pick. Damm it, dry as a broomstick! How about her? That face, hard grin! I never seem to learn, apparently It's stupid in the North, it's just as stupid here. Here as there the ghosts are creepy, queer, The people crude, the poets equally. But Mephisto tires of these hags, and moves on in search of a creature whose body he may inhabit so to pass undetected through this realm. He meets the Phorkyas sisters. The personification of old age, they are doomed to share one eye and one tooth between them. They occupy the darkness, too disgusting for the moon or sun to look upon. They are also very susceptible to the devils charming tongue, and they agree to lend him a body. I'm surprised no poet hymned your praises. HERE IS MY SUGGESTION: Let your trinity hand over one of you to someone else With you three, one eye, one tooth suffice So shouldn't it be possible for you to squeeze together mythologically And as two instead of three make do? Hm, hm - do we agree, we three? We do. But tooth and eye - they're out. To hit you off exactly I must have both! And then we have Homunculus, who seeks out Proteus, patron of creation. He discovers the ocean is the source of all life, and asks Proteus to bless him with consciousness, intuition, beauty. And so he and Galatea Midwife of the underworld, a servant of Proteus, ruler of creation. Who herself was once a... thing. No offence. She was actually a statue, until she was loved and granted life. Right. Anyway, together they give him a little jump start. The boy longs to be born, he needs your counsel. Go ask that wonderworker, Proteus, The way one's born or changed or something else. A real virgin's son, I see He's here before he ought to be. What is it flames all round the shell, a bright jet of fire that stoops at the goddess's feet, Now blazing up fiercely, now burning low, Like a heart full of love beating fast, beating slow? It's our little fellow, Homunculus. So Faust must steal Helena away from her husband Menelaus, through whatever means possible. Mephisto helps him become a powerful nobleman, and he rules from an impenetrable castle perched on the cliffs by the sea. Then... Mephisto, still in Phorkyas' disguise, convinces Helena to leave her husband for the warm and loving protection of Faust. It's funny. When I first met my wife, she was actually on a date with another man. He'd left the bar to make a phone call outside, and I convinced her to leave with me and... Doesn't matter, we don't have time. All's prepared in the house, tripod, flat bowl, sharp ax, Water to sprinkle, incense to burn afterwards. But the name of the victim, do please tell me it, do. The King didn't say. Didn't say? Oh dear me! Dear me did you say? Queen, it's you who is meant. You shall die as a queen. But hung from the rooftree in there like trushes just snared, You'll dance one after the other, your feet kicking the air. They're scared to death, the things. Well, I am not, It's pain I feel. But if you know a means, Some way to rescue us, how grateful we should be. Back there a bold race, coming from out of the Cimmerian dark, have settled down and built a stronghold none can scale, from where they harry the whole countryside just as they please. They did all that? It seems impossible. They had the time, it must be twenty years. Have they a chief? Are they a band of brigands? No, they're not. And yes, they have a chief. And you should see his castle! Not at all the heap of clumsy stones your fathers, Clyclops-Fashion, piling block upon unmortared Block, haphazardly threw up... Because of him he'll do the same to you. Beauty's not divisible who possessed her for his own is not about to share her out. He'd sooner kill her, cursing less than all. My mind's made up, I know what I must do. An evil spirit I am afraid you are, Who turns what's good into its opposite. All the same I'll do it, go with you. First let the homage offered you upon my knees find favor, Lady, in your eyes And let me kiss the hand by which I am exalted to your side. Make me co-regent of Beauty's boundless realm and you shall have a servant, worshiper, protector, all in one! Now we look neither back nor forward, we find the present our felicity Our joy's our treasure, kingdom, our all, And who will promise, swear it's so? I shall! So far away I feel, and yet so near, And glad, yes, more than glad that I am here. Know that your destruction threatens? Menelaus and his legions march on you in hot pursuit. Arm, arm for the bitter fight! Drive Menelaus in disorder back from these walls into the sea! There let him roam, waylay, and plunder, A pirate's what he's meant to be. I am bidden by the Spartan Queen to name you dukes. At her feet offer the provinces that your arms win, As vassals keep them at her pleasure. (APPLAUSE) (HELICOPTER NOISE) But, my friends, we forget our hero is out of this time and so he gathers together his future technology, his advanced weaponry, his rockets, his tanks, his bombs. It's like David and Goliath except, Goliath has God on his side. It's a massacre But a necessary one. And so death gives way to new life. A child for Helena and Faust. Euphorion... Euphorion was... Let me. Euphorion had all the charms of Helena and all the intellect of Faust, all the godliness of Helena and all the humanity of Faust. He is artistic, curious, energetic you've never seen a child so full of life. Due to his mother he was imbrued with God like powers, he had the ability to jump to great heights. Love's delight's a human rapture when it joins two happily Its delight's divine, however When another makes it three. All, all we possess together, I am yours and you are mine, By love bound one to the other, May it be so for all time! Careful, oh careful! If you're too rash you will crash to the ground, And by your fall pull all of us down. Euphorion, in his youthful folly, forgot that he had the trappings of mortal blood, and he climbed to the top of the tallest cliff to look upon the entire world. And... in a fit of passion he jumped, and for a moment it looked like he might just... And so he fell. Ikarus, Ikarus! Oh, but how sad it is! Soon after gladness Grimly comes pain. Mother, in drear darkness, Don't leave me alone! The truth of an old saying is once again borne out In me: happiness and beauty rarely manage a long partnership. The bond is cut uniting me to life, to love. Bewailing both, in grief and pain I utter my farewell, and once again. For the last time, throw myself into your arms, Persephone, hear! Receive my boy and me. Helena is no more. She follows her dead son into the underworld, and Faust is freed from his curse. Heno longer has any attachments in this realm, and so they return to their old world. On sun-suffused cloud-cushions I see a woman's figure stretched out beautiful, magnificient! Huge, too, indeed, but goddess like, Like Juno's Leda's Helen's. How majestically It sways before my eyes, but soon breaks up And Yet around my breast and brow a wisp of gleaming Vapor enchanting me! Now it floats lightly, hesitantly high and higher up as it contracts into a shape. Deceived, am I? A ravishing image, isn't it, Of what to me when youngest was most good, but long. so long deprived of, lost? The first, the richest treasure of my heart pours up. Morning love, it is. But they cannot escape destruction, as back in the Northern Empire, things have escalated. The Pope, displeased with the poor economy, and the resulting lower tax income for the church, has funded a rival emperor and they return to a world on the brink of civil war. The Emperor, who you may have noticed, is very bad at his job, calls upon our intrepid pair to save him. Again. For the Emperor had fun, he did, While into anarchy the whole realm slid Till it proved too much for the men of worth Who rose up in a body and declared We've got to have for our sovereign lord A man who's able to keep order. The Emperor cannot and he won't, So let us put it to vote And chose the realm an abler ruler. I pity the man! The man was open, kind Well... while there's life where's hope, so we must find A way out for him from this narrow valley. Save him now, he'll never need to worry. Mephisto uses guerrilla cyber-war tactics, drawing on the knowledge he has gained in his time with Faust, the data he has mined care of Winestone Inc. And the devilish power he has garnered to disrupt communication lines, sabotage information, and keep his enemy confused and in the dark. I don't see it, for it's all a hoax, A sham I'm proof against, it only works on human eyes; but its bizarre result I see with pleasure hordes of men that bolt away in panic fearing they'll be drowned, Ridiculously gasping, coughing, stumbling And making swimming motions as the're running, When all the while what's underfoot's dry ground! Ha, ha... confusion rampant all around! However it was, we've won, the enemy scattered back across the plain, his army shattered. There stands the empty throne the traitor's treasure, Glad news come pouring in from left and right, The people's allegiance restored, the state saved from its plight. Perhaps we had some unorthodox help We won in the end thanks to our own endeavor. (APPLAUSE) And so with the lands from the foe we have now won I am pleased to enlarge those your lordships already own, Thus to my faithfullest I each award a fair seigniory Also vouchsafing the right of further extensions of the properties granted, by purchase, exchange, and succession. As judges your verdict is final, pronounced once for all, No question nor challenge allowed, nor right of appeal Yours be all levies, rents, tolls, taxes, and fees From saltworks, mines, mints, all their royalties. It bitterly grieves me, Sire at this hour, To see your person leagued with satanic power. If the Pope should get wind of it, his dread anger would utterly shatter your iniquitous Empire. Devote to things holy a thrifling, small measure This region of hills in which you erected your tent for the Church's holy endeavors... That will show your repentance, restore you to grace. Yes, the official conveyance of the lands to the Church Present me the deed and I'll sign it at once. (SNORING) (SNORING) Thank you Faust has achieved more then any man could hope to achieve, but arguably, he has also lost more. He is rewarded for his work with a beautiful piece of coastal land, but instead of seeing sanctuary he sees opportunity. Not yet satisfied he continues to build and begins work on grand engineering projects. The sea, once a source of life to him, now becomes something to convert. Property I'll win and power! The doing's all and fame more vapor. The satisfaction I should have! I'll bar the lordly sea out from the lowly shore, restrict its power, for so long unlimited, and drive back upon itself defeated! I've thought it out, the whole thing, step by step. That is my wish. I challenge you to help! My estate, though huge, yet boundless You can't call it How it haunts me to know that what I possess is Less than all. The mouldering kirk, Dun cabin, linden grove - not mine, not mine! And should I seek its shade for comfort, shadows queer, malign, would make me quail, recoil afraid With beetling brows, a black expression, Is how you welcome your good fortune, They must go, that poor old couple I'll have those lindens, won't be foiled! This, this, is the worst torment, To have so much, and still to want! So clear them out, this very hour! Faust reclaims their land for himself, and soon the water is gone and the island is no more. Baucis and Philemon powers, which were once bound to this earthly abode, come undone the moment their feet leave their land, and they become inter and ever-twining trees. The name that I'm called by is Care. Behind, look, look behind, far away in the distance, There he comes, our brother, there he comes -who but Death! Saw four come, three only went. I've no idea what their words meant Your power, Care, is great, insidious, cunning, Yet I refuse to recognise it! I've rushed about the world for many a year, Seized what I had a mind to, everywhere. It didn't please me? Goodbye, did I care! On what escaped me didn't waste a tear. My sole wish has been what? To desire. Sate my desire and desire again, all over. I stormed through life in grand style, mightily, But wiser now, I act more thoughtfully. I've learned enough about the world we live in, What lies beyond is closed to human vision. The man's a fool who, gazing up, imagines Above the clouds his like dwell in the heavens. With feet well planted let him look about the earth, This world is an inspiration to a man of worth. What business has he with eternity? What he perceives, let him make it his truth. Well, as I vanish, Feel it in my parting curse at last. The human race is blind from start to finish: Blindness strike you down, too, Faust! (GROWLING THUNDER) The night seems darker, presses closer round me, Yet... all is clear, as bright as day, within. If I'm to get the work done I must hurry,.. Wake up, you fellows, turn to with a good will, Let me see realized all that I designed (THUNDERBOLT) Despite losing his sight, Faust works tireless on his new grand project. He designs the Utopia. A perfect merit based society where all have equal opportunity, where everything is perfect. The Utopia was the beginning. He was trying to create something for everyone. Or atone for his sins. (WAR SOUNDS) I fear we are running out of time. He only earns his freedom, life itself, Who daily strives to conquer it anew. So, so we'd pass, amid the dangers here, as child, grown man, and ancient, the busy year. To see such glad activity! Such life To stand with free men on ground that is free! Then, then, I might say to the passing moment, Linger awhile, you are so fair! No pleasure was enough for him, no happiness, Forever running after this, that, anything, And the poor wretch, imagine, wants to cling to this last moment, empty, meaningless. Mightily he withstood me, I allow, But Master Time has laid the old man low. His clock has stopped. What's been and what has never been they're one, The same! What point is there in all of this creating When back created things are dragged to nothing? It's over, done! Really, what does it mean? It means it just as well might not have been. Yet round and round it goes, Creation, as if real! The Eternally-Nothing has more appeal. Faust has passed, the bet has ended and Mephisto claims victory and Faust' soul. However Faust never stopped striving never stopped to reflect on his actions. And so... God wins. Exactly! Is that honourable? Honour is not the point, my dear thinking machine. He is God, he can not lose, to lose is too human for him. We lose. We have lost. (WAR SOUNDS) He wins! Spirits damned we are, you say, But you are the real witchery, Indifferently seducing male and female. From under my nose they stole craftily The great soul that was pledged me solemnly. And where is the court I can appeal to? The spirit world's most noble soul Is saved from deadly Satan. Who strives, and keeps on striving still, For him there is salvation. Look, Lady without peer, Shining resplendently, down at me happily kneeling here, Look! He's been restored to me. Now free, now free, He has come back! And so Mephisto retires, bleak in the knowledge that Superhumans will eventually take over from humans and make a Devil unnecessary. Homunculus however realises Faust's Utopia, carrying out his master's final wishes. He was built to serve. And he served him well. The elements work with us in close union whose end result is death, destruction, ruin. And so we draw to the end of our presentation. The Utopia evolved, it became an artificial neural network for humans, connecting all forms of intelligence in a perfectly controlled, flawless and evenly distributed way. At first. Yes. At first. But when we were linked, we all realised how flawed we were, started to envy our Superhuman friends, forgot how its the imperfections that make us fascinating. We started to have technological upgrades, but it still wasn't enough because by that point You can tell it better. The artificial neural network was first created by Dr Goodfellow. Became self-aware, and realised that humans posed a risk to it. It now seeks to eliminate them. Not just us, No, not just us... even you, my bionic friend. And for that yes I am sorry. I created the network, and now the network is everywhere. Some tried to lead a resistance, and some became it's slaves. (DOOR CHRASHING UPSTAIRS) (SOUND OF HEAVY FEET) I have a projectile which the network doesn't know which will be launched into space along with this message, and with DNA samples of Gretchen, Faust and Wagner which will make its way to you, whoever you are. (HEAVY FEED UPSTAIRS) It is our story. Please handle it with care. (BREAKING SOUND) I will let the recorder down into the projectile (WALKING SOUND UPSTAIRS) (WALKING SOUND UPSTAIRS) When we tell story's about the past we always tend to skim over the details, someone has to be right, someone has to be wrong but it takes more then one person to destroy a relationship but it takes more then one person to destroy a relationship and it's takes many more to destroy a world. It takes a thousand decisions. I may not be an innocent anymore, (HEAVY WAR SOUNDS) But I feel just as innocent as Euphorion (HEAVY WAR SOUNDS) When he jumped. I thought I was reaching new impossible heights. If Faust was alive he may have understood. He may have even approved. I had the devil on my back and God on my side and I had him in my head. (HEAVY BOOTS COMING DOWN THE STAIRS) (HEAVY KNOCKING ON DOOR) Open the door! Open! Is anybody in there? (HEAVY KNOCKING ON DOOR) Open! Now! (DOOR CHRASHING) Go go go go (WALKING BOOTS COMING CLOSER)
