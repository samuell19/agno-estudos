[wind blowing] [ominous music playing] [thunder rumbling] [boy] When do I get to go? [man] When you know what you're looking at. [boy] Dad, I know. One 1,000, two 1,000, three-- [gasps] Less than a mile away. [thunder continues] [man] Here, put this on. [heart beating] [man] You hear it? [heart continues beating] One day, your mom and I are gonna build one for that. -[boy] Are you ever scared? -[man] Nah. When you do something you love, there's nothing to be afraid of. [radio static] [woman over radio] BWQ, it's time. [woman] Bill, you better keep your phone on this time. -[Bill laughs] -[woman] Hey, I mean it. [boy] Wait! Wait! Dad! [reporter over radio] ...all the way to the ground, but there's definite strong rotation right in the middle of that rain, and that's going to be near I-40, just after I-40, or near and just be, I would say, uh, the first Geary exit, the first, that would be Highway 281 exit here from Geary exit, Gary. Thank you. [Gary over radio] All right, you're watching the storm west on Highway 33 west of Kingfisher tornado. These storms continue to intensify Will, don't play with Mommy's things. [Gary] ...developing and circulating the South Central Garfield County around Southwest Kingfisher needs to be watched. All these are cyclonic, and there's another one just due south of Greenfield moving northeast. -There's the one west - Where's Daddy headed? [man laughs] Hey, hey, hey. [Roy] Hey, buddy. We got two of them. We're gonna figure out some kind of seating arrangement. Sorry, Mr. Brody. I brought my classmate. I hope that's all right. Your funeral. And you're in Long Horn Country now. [thunder crashes] [Bill] Everything's bigger in Texas. -Roy... -[Roy] Yeah. [Bill] Put Quinn's probes in their trunk. You take the lead. [Roy] You sure? [Bill] I'll ride with these guys. -[Roy] All right, go ahead. -[Jacob] Yup. [grunts] [thunder roaring] [reporter on TV] ...hundred miles an hour ...still on the ground to Southeast-- [Quinn] What do you mean my student is driving? [Roy over phone] We couldn't fit. [Quinn] OU only covers our truck and Bill as a driver. -Do you understand? -What do you want me to do? He's chasing the storm, I'm chasing him. [Quinn] Jesus. What's your twenty? [reporter indistinct over TV] ...you are not gonna see them coming. You're gonna have to basically be in the barricade to... Tell my husband to answer his phone. [Bill] MBQ, I wish you could see this! -Dad! - It's biblical! Looks like a grass fire, the way the dirt's being pulled in. Being in a car in a tornado is a really bad idea. -[beeps] - Bill, you have a phone for a reason! We are not pulling another storm like Joplin. -[beeping] -[Bill] It's just to the south of us. We can get ahead of her, and I'd say she's closer to Hallam, Nebraska. [Roy] No, Bill. It's more like if Jarrell and Joplin had a baby. [reporter] Just pulling huge volumes of air. Now you listen here. Forty-four. Turn North. [Roy] Bill, let's do what she says. Exit here. - [Quinn] Forty-four. Turn North. -[Roy] Bill, let's end this! - [beeping] -Bill. -[Bill] We can't afford to lose it! -Go, go, go! - Bill. It's too wide. -Bill, north now. -[Roy] Stop! Bill, do you copy? Floor it. She's cutting you off. -Floor it! -[beeping] [Quinn] Bill. [cries] It's the type of storm that will kill you. - Bill. [cries] -[Roy] We're looking to southwest... Bill! [reporter] Tornado or not, what I can tell you is the whole sky is sitting on the ground and it Is just churning. One 1,000, two 1,000 ... three 1,000, four... [thunder rumbling] [pensive music playing] [indistinct police chatter over radio] [woman over radio] ...red or burgundy red hair... [police chatter continues] We found one kid about 200 yards that way. We're still looking for the other. He most likely had his seatbelt on. [phone vibrating] [phone continues vibrating] [whirring] [beeps] [grunts] [sighs] [beeping] [vacuum whirrs] I just mopped that. [William] Yeah, I know. We've gotta get going. We're gonna fall behind. [Quinn sighs] [water dripping] [water runs] [dryer whirrs] [dryer beeps] [William] You all done up here? [door creaks] [Quinn] What about the second load? [heavy footsteps] [William] I don't want her to see me here. [heavy footsteps] Please, Mom. [birds chirp] Come on, Mom. Let's go. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [Quinn exhales] Are you wearing lipstick? What? No. I gotta get eggs when we get home. Don't worry about it. -Now, I'm gonna be late. -Ah, that's my boy. -[engine struggles] -Aye. Oh, great. You know it always takes two tries. -[engine starts] -There we go. Yeah. -[horn beeps] -[William] Don't do that. [dramatic music plays] [thunder rumbles] [electricity whirrs] [thunder rumbles] [dramatic music continues] [indistinct chatter] Oh, my God. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I can... Okay, okay. [teacher] Okay, class, don't forget, -thermodynamic packets are due when? -[laughter] -[thunder rumbles] -End of the week, all right? If you guys would like to procrastinate, I'II give you four days to do this. -You started yet? -[teacher] Come on. -Nearly done. -Serious? -[chuckles] -If you help me with mine, I'll give you another driving lesson. Deal. [clears throat] William Brody, could you please escort this officer to your locker? [chair scrapes] [woman] She asked for this. [man] I don't even know what she's looking for. Please stay seated until Mr. Keaton's ready for you. [woman] Yes, he was in the office. He was being sure. [thunder crashes] [dynamic music playing] -[secretary] Hey! -William Brody! Okay. Temperature conversion, it's in the packet, it's important. Make sure that y-- [dynamic music continues] -What is that? -It's Brody. -Yeah, that's him. -Oh, my gosh. [indistinct chatter] [thunder roars] [whirring] [male student] Does Brody think he's Spider-Man? [beeping] [device powers down] [thunder roars] [student] Why's he still up there? [student 2] He's gonna get hit by lightning. -Oh, my God. Is he doing-- -[thunder roars] [device whirrs] -[girl] I told you he's crazy. -He is so-- [thunder roars] So you thought it would be a good idea to get up on the roof in the middle of a thunderstorm, turn this thing on and see what happens? It's what Dad did. Dad didn't go to college. It's just a microphone. How would you know if it works? I'm not going to be the reason you get expelled. College is your way out, you understand? Do you understand? Will-- [footsteps receding] -[door closes] -For god's sake. [dramatic music plays] [engine revs] [brakes squeal] I can't do this. [Harper] It's okay. It's all about timing. This is why people have automatics. Okay. When I squeeze, I want you to give it gas. Okay? Yeah. [gear shifts] [engine revving] [chuckles] See? You did it. [chuckles] [William] Whoa, we're moving. [chuckles] -[Harper] We're moving. Okay. -[William] Yeah. -[Harper] Okay, nice and slow. -[William laughs] [Harper] Turn, turn, turn... -And come to a stop. -[tire squeaks] [William gasps] It worked. Can I ask you a question? Who goes out onto a roof to get close to the sky? [engine rumbles] Do you ever think about where you go when you die? [sighs deeply] -[tires screech] -[William] This is not stopping. This is not stopping! Harper, I'm--I'm so sorry. -Don't sweat it. It's okay. -Shit. You got a pen pal in Texas? [soft music playing] [sniffs] Hey. Come here. Check this out. My dad was a genius. She never understood him. Maybe you don't understand her. When I lost my mom... that's when I realized how important she was to my dad. [door opens] -[door closes] -[Quinn] Hey! I have take-out. Hey, hey. Mom, did you know about this? -He kept such detailed notes. -Where did you get that? Does it- does it matter? I mean, you could use it for your research. Harper. I think it's time for Harper to go. Hey, wait, wait, wait. No, no, no. No. What are you so upset about? This is the best chance I've ever had at understanding Dad. [Quinn] I loved your dad. I miss him every bit as much as you do, Will, but that book, that book is not for you. -You are better than-- -Hey, hey, what the hell? Better than what? The man who got all your research tested? And that's why you gave up on fieldwork, right? Too much of a chicken shit to put yourself in real danger? No, Will. gave up fieldwork to be your mother. And sometimes it's okay to be afraid because I am standing here and he's not. When you do something you love, there's nothing to be afraid of. Yeah, yeah. I heard that before. Thanks to you, I have no idea who my dad was. I think I'll leave, actually. Oh... yeah. [pensive music plays] [car engine revs] [music continues] -[knocks on door] -[Quinn] Will, honey? Will, you awake? Will? [line rings] [Will's phone rings] Oh, for the love of God. [dramatic music playing] Thank you, sir. [indistinct conversation over radio] [dog barks] [wind chimes tinkling] [car door opens] [suspenseful music plays] [suspenseful music intensifies] [gun cocks] [Roy] State your name and business. Uncle Roy? I knew I shouldn't have put a return address. Hey, wait! How the hell did you even get here anyway? I just took a few-- And what in the world has that woman been feeding you, huh? You know what? Never mind, the less know... Let me guess, you came to be a storm chaser just like your dad. No, I never really thought about it. Yeah, I bet you didn't. Does your mom know you're here? I'm guessing not. She's the reason I'm here. She really never talks about him anymore. So I started reading through the journal-- Whoa, whoa, whoa. The journal wasn't an invitation. I'm not your parent. I'm not even really your uncle. Your dad... There was no one like him. Never will be. Including you. There. That's the speech. She cleans houses, Roy. The smartest woman you've ever met cleans houses. I can't babysit you, kid. It is primetime storm season and now I make a living babysitting tourists, and--and idiots. Idiot tourists, worst of all. But here, I'll tell you what. Here. Ticket home, it's on me. And then, if your mom asks, here, you couldn't find me or--or I'm dead. You pick. [engine starts] [honks] [door opens] -[Roy] Van is way bigger than you. -[William] Barely. [dramatic music plays] [sighs] Bill, your kid is here. [Roy mutters indistinctly] You so much as breathe on me, I will shoot you. Here, check this out. [William] Oh, wow. [Roy] All that heating at 90 degrees cooking all that moisture. You can't get out of the pot. Once that cap goes away, it explodes. Then you kick in the low-level jet. Bingo. What's this do? [Roy] Well, police lights for emergencies. -Is it legal? -No, not-not exactly. [officer] Look, he's 16, and he doesn't have his phone. So I'm sure he's gonna be back before dark. If he ain't here by sundown, then we'll officially designate him a missing person. Start an investigation. So what am I supposed to do now? [officer] All you can do is wait. [dramatic music playing] [music swelling] Son of a-- [vehicle approaches] [man] It's about damn time. Hey, remember this. Please, you are not William Brody. Not today. You stay put. [car door opens, closes] [Roy] Hi. Hey, good morning, everybody. -Yeah. Good morning. -Good morning. Finally. [Roy] Uh-huh. Good morning, Chuck. Remember, today's the last day to get your merchandise. [Chuck[ Yeah, no thanks. You guys charge too much. [Roy] Oh, come on, Chuck. We take cash. -We take PayPal. We take-- -Are we gonna see a tornado? [phone rings] -Roy speaking. -[Quinn] He's with you, isn't he? - Yeah. - Where are you, Roy? I'm getting in the car. It's, uh... it's our last day today, Quinn. I'll--I'll get him home. Just know that he's safe, okay? There is no place in that entire time zone that's safe this time of year, Roy. Where's the target? Call you back. [intense music] [Chuck] Take it from me. Plan the wedding for winter. Then your wife's happy 'cause you'll never risk missing your anniversary for chase season. You lost? That's my nephew. He's just here for the night. You're paying for his seat? We're not running a charity here. Paperwork. Just sign this. It says consent of the parent or guardian-- For god's sake, just sign the damn thing. He doesn't talk, his name isn't on the manifest. He was never here. Let's go. [clears throat] [Zane] Ladies and gentlemen, please keep your arms and your legs inside the vehicle at all times. Thank you. Don't break anything. [laughs] You better buckle up. We got an enhanced risk today. So true. [engine struggles] [engine struggles] [tapping] [sighs] He's not here, is he? We-- [clears throat] Well, let me come with. I can help. You're a kid. Go home. No. [engine struggles] [engine stops] [exhales] [engine revs] [tires squeal] [dynamic music plays] [Roy] How's Florida? It's a whole place. They get storms there, too. -[William] Lightning capital of the world. [chuckles] -[Chuck chuckles] I wouldn't call them storms. More like afternoon showers. You're gonna get an education today, kid. [scoffs] Kid's probably forgot more about meteorology than you'll ever know. -[Zane] Him? -[Roy] Yeah. All right, kid. Explain to me where we're going today and why. May I? [William] Judging from that, dry line's over the Texas Panhandle. If dew points rise, converging winds should set things off in a few hours. Should be an explosive day. But, uh, I'm sure you all knew that. Kid's a genius. [chuckles] Nice. You want to bust my balls? Let's try it again when we're in chaos. Finding the finger of God inside of a target zone over 100,000 miles... ...that's what we do. [Roy] We do follow three rules. Rule number one: always make sure you got at least a half a tank of gas. Rule number two: always, always, always make sure you got an escape. Generally, these storms move to the east and the north. Wait, why "generally?" It's just typical. It's not hard and fast. The goal is to target the southeast corner of a cell and to lead it. That way, all you got to worry about is driving east and south to get out of its way. Find yourself having to improvise and you're already in trouble. So what's rule number three? [ominous music plays] Never get caught in the Bear's Cage. -Never get caught in the vault. -[chuckles] Mm-hmm. [Roy] The most violent tornadoes are rain-wrapped. You won't see nothing until you're... 30 feet in the sky. No, sir. Your first time? So, uh, what happens if you get caught in the Bear's Cage? You better find a ditch or a pool. Ha! Bring your sunblock and your swim trunks, if you dare. [music intensifies] Hey, chasin' is 90 percent driving and 10 percent witnessing the Creator's wrath. I pride myself on getting closer to the heat than any other tour company. When you kiss it right on the mouth. [chuckles] So what's the deal with the thing? What thing? It looked like a bomb. Will took it up on the roof. Not a bomb. Not a bomb. It can save lives. So what's the deal with you and Will? He thought you were pretty since the third grade. [chuckles] That's not it. You treat him good. I... I like the way that he looks at the sky. -It--it's fine. -I... If you're gonna smoke, it's fine. I'II save it or later. [sighs] [Roy] Cell's developing here pretty quick. It's telling me it's ten miles out. I can't see shit. Just wait till we clear the rocks. Okay, once we clear the canyon, that's when you're gonna want to pull out your cameras. Can I help you? [engine revving] [intense music plays] [tires squeal] What are you doing, boy? It's absolutely massive. Get back there before it starts moving. Like having a puppy in the car. Do you want to get me fired? God Almighty. [indistinct chatter] [Zane] Hey, pull over here, right here. You sure? There's no pavement there. -I'm sure. -Okay. -Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey. -What, Frank? What are you gonna do? [Frank] Don't park in the grass. Get off the grass, Zane. You piece of shit. Blow that out your ass, Frank. [horses neighing] Remember, stay away from the road. Stay tight as a group. And when I say we go, we go. And hey, [laughs] enjoy the show. Keep him on a leash. [excited chatter] -[car door closes] -[man] Finally. [sweeping music] See how the anvil blasts miles out over the horizon? [wind blows] You feel that? That cool breeze? You feel it? Yeah, that's her outflow. I don't remember them being this big. [scoffs] Well, they get bigger. You got yourself a classic Supercell right there. You can see her rotating from the wall cloud below the base all the way up her updraft. Now... when the wind turns warm from the back, that's when she's feeding, growing toward you. I should have brought my phone. [scoffs] Hey, Chuck, you're boning my shot. [music intensifies] Keep your eye on that funnel! This thing is happening. Right now, it's just a funnel. But watch. Watch. Watch the ground beneath. Soon as you see debris kick up... you got yourself a bona fide tornado. [music swelling] It's real. Wow. This is gonna buy me a Rolex. Why aren't we closer? We got the best seat in the house. Being in the front row just gets you killed. -[thunder crashes] -The cell to the south is choking her off. [whistles] -[man 1] Come on. -[man 2] Let's go! -Let's go! -Everybody in the van! -Big winds on the way. -[horses neighing] [Roy] Let's go! Let's go! Get in! [man] God. [engine starts] Shit. -[thunder rumbles] -[Roy] I'm gunning it. It's not moving. Give it a rest. [emergency alarm beeping] Hail core's about to pass overhead. [thudding] Two inches? [thudding continues] Three and a half. [alarm beeping] Is it bad? It's real bad. [intense thudding] [thudding calms] Everybody okay? Is that a yes?! -[Chuck] Yeah. We're okay. -[whooping] You just experienced gorilla hail. Ha-ha. You're welcome. -[car door opens] -[whimpers] [woman] Did you see the size of the hail? That's what we get for going off the pavement. Storage is just over the state line from Shamrock. [Roy] You want me to get the other van? [Zane] Try to catch us one more chase before sundown. Hey, listen, I want to talk to you. I think we can get our money back. Hey, don't even think about it, Chuck. You're not getting your money back. You signed a waiver, remember? Hey, was hat a tornado? If it was, we'd be deader than dead. [Quinn] Yes, I know. So you guys are still in Panhandle? [Roy] We'll be in Liberal tonight. - Kansas? - Yeah, that's the one. [Quinn] I should be there by lunch. You're, uh... you're not mad at me, are you? He ambushed me. [Quinn] You have my only kid, Roy. He doesn't know how dangerous this world is. He's in good hands. [man] Damn, girl. Where are you coming from? Right. I'll be in touch. Hey, buddy. Hi. [chuckles] If you want to hit on somebody, why don't you hit on someone your age, eh? [chuckles] Yeah. You got a smoke? Oh, thanks, man. Lighter. Trade that. Gentlemen shouldn't smoke. I was just playing around. Where are you going? You ever been to Kansas, Dorothy? [pensive music] [pensive music continues] [William] Why didn't he listen to you? Well, Zane's changed. Every time you sell one of those trucker hats with our name on it, does my mom get a cut? [scoffs] Yeah. I already knew the answer to that. [Roy] You know... one of the things I loved most about your dad? How he could... He could look up at the sky and know... everything he needed to know. He didn't need some radar on his phone. Nowadays, you download some app, run a car, you call yourself a chaser. [William] What's that got to do with anything? [Roy] Right after we lost your dad, your mom was forced to bankrupt the lab. Brody Storm Labs eventually became Brody Storm Tours... And here we are. [William] What about Zane? You really needed that guy as a partner? [laughs] Do I look like a partner? Huh? I'm an employee. Hey... I gotta eat. So do we. Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. If it helps... your name is the only reason it's still here. [dramatic music plays] It has value. It means something. Yeah. That some crazy asshole got two students killed. We gotta go. [sweeping music playing] Come on! [music intensifies] See that wall of cloud? Wait, that one? You dumb son of a bitch, that one right there. [man] Hurry up! Round the place. There's Cornshit. Hurry up. Get the mask. Put them inside. Let's go. [man 2] Okay, all right. Start it up. [Zane] Took you long enough. -Pulled a two-hour turn around. -Okay, kid. Get out. You change his diapers? Chuck is really startin' to piss me off this year. [thunder rumbling] -[bell jingles] -[woman] Daphne, you hear me? Put it down. You don't need that. You only get one. You hear me? One. [crowd clamoring] [tires screech] [tires screech] [thunder rumbling] [Zane] That's us. Let's go. Where's the kid? -I don't know. -We gotta go, man. [indistinct chatter on radio] [honks] [emergency alert on radio] [man on radio] The National Weather Service in Warren Town has issued a Tornado warning for: Anderson County, Norton County, Bolton County, Warren County... ...at 1:45 p.m. [woman] Mind your manners. [man on radio] National Weather Service Doppler radar indicated... [man] Hey, man. You got the time? ...a severe thunderstorm capable of producing a tornado five miles northwest. [clamoring] -Look, he's safer here anyway. -We can come back for him. We'll be leaving in just a moment, folks. Yeah. There's one person in there, a there's a whole bunch here. This is not a choice; I will fire you. [engine starts] [man on radio] ...for potential shelter... [cashier] Don't worry. If it was headed this way, all those chasers would still be here. [bell chimes] [wind blows] [thunder rumbles] [cashier] Lock that door. Lock it. [tornado siren blares] Shelter. [siren continues] [dial tone] This isn't a shelter. No, no, no! [phone line beeps] [grunts] [line beeps] [siren fades] [woman] Yeah, he's in here. [man] How many-- Your nephew's got a horseshoe stuck up is ass. Probably make the seven o'clock news. That'd be good. [tires screech] We're here with the son of the legendary Storm Chaser Bill Brody, who just survived the Shamrock tornado in a phone booth. Tell us what happened here today. Well, yeah. Well, I-I was-- Hey, everybody. I'm Zane Rogers, proud owner of the Brody Storm Tours Company. William Brody here is set to join the family business and-- and carry on his father's work. Am I right, son? -What the hell are you doing? -Hey, you're interrupting me. You may have been able to buy the Brody name, -but you will never be Bill Brody. -Oh, really? Aren't you the one that turned his father into a hood ornament? Yeah. We are the premier tour company in this area. hope you realize we've been doing this for probably nigh on about 20-- -[grunts] -[crowd gasps] [grunts] You can fire me now. Hurry, hurry. Set up the shots. -[camera shutters clicking] -[man] Hold on. Hold on. [man 2] Yeah, yeah, yeah. -[laughs] -[man] Zoom in on him. -Where the hell were you? -Huh? What? You know what I'm talking about. Do you have any idea how scared I was? I just wanted some popcorn. You think this is a game? [grunts] No. Then why'd you send me this? What? What use is it to me? I thought it was a nice gesture. No, that's bullshit. No, you need me. [scoffs] The hell I do. What do I need with a kid? I'll show you. [dynamic music plays] I'll be damned. She did it. I got to charge it tonight, but... I found it. Found- found what? [William] Mom. She cracked it. All this time... Now we can hear it coming from miles away. [sighs] Wait. Hey. -Wow. -[Roy chuckles] [music continues] Go on. Get in. I can almost smell him. My dad, his hands were so big. I'd stare at them for hours while he drove. I'd wonder if mine would look like that. That's what makes you a man. To be honest, Will, I don't think that has anything to do with it. Hey, slide over. -Where are we going? -Oh, you'll see. [car approaching] [thunder rumbling] [Roy] Keep your eyes on the radar. I'll watch the road. You got a girl? Yeah? Is she cute? She's smart. That's what I like. [Roy] Cute, too, bet. Since the seventh grade. [rain falls] [thunder booms] All right, we're through it in no time. How long you two been dating? I don't know. We're just friends. That won't keep. You're a Brody. [engine stops] All right. You ready? [thunder rumbles] Welcome to the backside of a Supercell. [clattering] This is unbelievable. [Roy] Hey. You think I'll ever see him again? I mean... when it's over for me, too. Do you think so? I'm not much of the spiritual type. But... I'll tell you what. There was this, uh... old lady in--in Shamrock. Back in '77, and she told me... she left for the bank one day, and, um, she forgot her paycheck on the dining room table. That day, a tornado took her home, everything, everything was gone. The fridge had been tossed about two miles on the other side of 1-40. The only thing left standing... was that dining table, with the check still on it. [William chuckles] [Roy] If there's anything I've learned from all of this, it's... any law you got, it will defy it. So yeah. Yeah, I think you'll see your dad again. Well, uh... Mom won't be cleaning houses much longer. I'll make sure of that. [Roy] The sky will always show you something you haven't seen. It's why we feel the way we do the morning of a chase. For me... well, that's the end of it. Well, I'm just getting started. [sweeping music] Woo-hooo! Whoo! Whooo! -Whoo-hoo! -[William laughs] You know, Will made me watch every episode of Storm Chasers. That must have been painful. Why'd you let them film you? Bill thought... that if we raised our profile, people would open up their pocketbooks. He was right. You're lucky, Harper. Money solves a lot of problems. If I could, I'd trade it all for my dad to come watch me play soccer. You know, a long time ago, Bill introduced me to the sky, and I fell in love with him. He also used my science in a whole bunch of different ways that nobody ever had in the business. I don't understand. You guys were the best at what you did. How could-- When you do something as dangerous as going into a place where the wind that can throw your car hundreds of yards, every ride home, you get little more numb. So the next time you go back... you want to go in further... and you want to stay longer... to satisfy some sort of... what, I don't know. If my grad student hadn't taken a friend, they'd be here. If they would have loaded one 50-pound probe into the truck rather than two, they'd be here. If they'd taken Highway 44, they'd be here. If they had been on any other stretch of land at that moment, they... I used to think that the risk that we took had some sort of calling because... Because we chased for knowledge... not thrill. I guess Mother Nature doesn't care. [chuckles] Then why do it? Because somebody has to. I just don't want it to be Will. [tense music] [Roy snoring] [distant conversation] [man laughs] Dry line stalled. Take a look at these lapse rates for tomorrow. Oh, you thinking about Southwest Nebraska? -Oh, yeah. -All right. -Hey, bud. -[William] Hey. You chase today? Yeah, yeah, yeah. For the first time. All right, hang on. Give this kid a beer. -Come on in, buddy. -Sure. [Martin] Yeah, first chase, first beer, man. Thanks, guys. -Have a seat. -Thanks. [Martin] You know about the HRRR and the NAMNEST? Um, yeah. Yeah, a little bit. Okay. What about, uh, what about CAPE values? Look, let me tell you. Okay, so at about a thousand CAPE, all right, -you're gonna get thunderstorms. -Mm-hmm. It's as simple as that. Today, the CAPE was 2,600 and you saw what happened, right? All right, now look at this. At four p.m. tomorrow... Six p.m. Eight p.m. At eight p.m., Southwest Nebraska is forecasted to see CAPE values between 4,500 and 5,000. A loaded gun. That-that's good, right? Is it good? Son, those are Wichita Fall numbers. Yeah. [Skip] The day Bill Brody and those kids became a missile. -[knocking on door] -[Zane] Ding dong. [Skip] Mr. Brody Storm Tours himself! Zane, kid here popped his cherry today. -[Zane] No shit. -[Martin] Yup. I'm so sorry, guys. Thanks for the beer. Um, I--I should go. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You don't know who this is? You're disrespecting his old man? This is Bill Brody's son! Wait, you're the kid? I heard that you rode one out in a phone booth. Hey, your father's a legend. This kid's parents are the reason I started chasing. Did you know that? -Seriously? -Yeah. [Skip] Wow. The probes they engineered. Yeah. They--they still hold the record for most intercepts. Boy, your mom has some brass. We used to call her the Mama Bear because of all the time she spent in that Bear's Cage. [chuckles] Nobody collects data there unless it's by accident. Yeah, except for the Brodys. Bill Brody did things nobody else dared to do and he did 'em again and again. I mean, he pulled off the moon landing with nothing more than a high school diploma. Now how does somebody like that ever get into money trouble? I--I don't follow. Science love scientists. Even though your dad had your mom, he was always gonna be an outsider. People love labels. It's easier. To them, he was... an adrenaline junkie. -Just like the rest of us. -Cheers. -[men chuckle] -Why can't you be both? Well... when you're ready to prove them wrong, you know where to find me. Anyway... [groans] I need my hat here, boy. I got me a van full of new troops in the AM and I don't have an effing driver. Gawd! Ah, I should probably head out too, guys. All right, well, hey, boys. Y'all be safe tomorrow. If those Southwesterlies get backed by the southeast... Wake up. Whoo! Don't become friends with them. They're gonna be dead by the end of the month. -[both chuckle] -[Skip] Son of a bitch. [William] Hey. Hey! Wait. Why did you tel me all that? I meant everything I said. But there's a dark side to this, and your father crossed over from time to time. Shit, we all have. But he never lost sight of what was important. Nice watch. Battle scars. I dig it. [soft music] [birds chirping] [music continues] [indistinct chatter] [man] We were all laughing. [door opens] [man] Hey. [crowd murmurs] [man] That's Bill Brody's son. It's your fan club. What's happening? Ghost of a giant, kid. Follow me. [applause] -Are you some sort of celebrity? -[chuckles] So, what can I get you fellas? I am gonna have the world-famous huevos rancheros, please. You know what? Make it two. I hate to be a bother, but how bad is it gonna get? Where do you live? Well, I'm just a couple of miles down the road. But my sister lives up in Colby. -Does she have a shelter? -Yes, sir. [Roy] Tell her to stay near it. The storms are probably going to clear to the northeast, but best be safe. I used my dad's concept as a guide. So, uh, when I reviewed the models... -[woman] Hey, new reports out. -[William] ...it all clicked. -[man] What does it say? -[woman] Imperial, yeah. -[man] Oh, really? -[man 2] Hey, hey, Southwest Nebraska. [man] Well, don't wait for us! Let's go! [clamoring] [suspenseful music] No, no, no. Your mom is meeting us here. And she's on her way. Until then, we stay put. How does she know where I was? You're my responsibility until you become your mom's, so sit your ass down. [man] Don't wait, bro. Let's go. Roy Cameron. Just wait. If you taste those huevos rancheros, it'll change your life. [man] Hey, get outta there. You're being a dick. Let's go. [Zane] You boys ready? Let's go. [music intensifies] Got a high roller today, bought out the tour. Can't afford to worry about an intercept now. Just get me within range. I need this. And think of the story; it'll tell itself. Okay. The next few hours, I'm God. Whatever I say goes. All right? Have you ever heard of plausible deniability? Every day. -[bell jingles] -I'm serious. If you're tired of messing around, being a tour operator... give me a call. -Say hi to Kim for me. -I will. Not again. [dramatic music] [thunder rumbling] [Zane] Mr. Khan, you're in for a treat today. We've got the son of the legendary Storm Chaser, Bill Brody, riding along with us. [speaking in Hindi] Big Bill. The Dalai Lama of storm chasers. [speaking in Hindi] What did he say? You like history? [William] I love history. In 1949, a guy named Dr. Horace Byers was hired by the government to find out why commercial airliners were falling out of the sky. He got some fighter pilots to fly their jets through thunderstorms and they discovered that nearly all storms are like lungs. One breath in, one breath out. Simple. But there was an outlier. Under the right conditions, there was a particular storm that would rotate its rain out of its throat, allowing it to breathe in and out... for hours. You know what he called it? Supercell. Good boy. [speaking in Hindi] [suspenseful music plays] [bell jingles] [Quinn] Roy. Uh-huh. Hello, Roy. -He abducted me. -Uh-huh, I'm sure. You look... like a whole person still. Gee, thanks. Where's my son before I castrate you? Really? In front of the kid? I'm 17. You're the heartbreaker since the seventh grade. Where's my son, Roy? [nervous sigh] [indistinct conversation over radio] [radio static] [in Hindi] We haven't seen storm as severe as this before. [thunder crashes] [dramatic music] [static and announcement over radio] [device whirring] Does that tin can work? [device whirring] [Roy over radio] Zane, come in. You got William Brody with you? -[device beeps] - [William] Shit. Hey, hey, hey. Careful. Put it back in the van. Let's go. [dramatic music] [tires screeching] [Quinn] can't believe it. You're still pulling the same shit that you did ten years ago? Why don't you just eliminate me? You're so good at eliminating the Brodys. You know, if it wasn't for me, Bill would have checked out long before Wichita Falls. I took on that man's load while you stayed at home playing keyboard cowboy! I was raising our son, Roy. But I stayed here! I was here... trying to--to preserve something. And I gotta tell you something, Quinn. Your son? He is one of us. You had no right to give him that journal, Roy. He loves you, Quinn, but you can't put a collar on a no-collar dog -and expect him to be happy. -Hey! Shouldn't we be chasing? I'll drive my husband's truck. -[engine starts] -You getting in? [foreboding music] [engine revving] [thunder rumbles] Buckle up. We're going to war. [Ramesh] So exciting to be here. So exciting to be here. -[beeping] -[Zane] Anything? [tires screech] [engine revs] I thought Imperial was the target. Not for deployment. But we don't need to get close with the microphone. The whole point is that we can do it from a safe distance. Come on, son. We're cowboys, just like your dad. [tense music playing] [wind whooshing] The place they're going to is very dangerous. [thunder rumbling] Oh, God. [engine revving] [vehicle honks] Find me an East route or we're gonna lose it. No, we're too close. We're not too close. East route, now! [in Hindi] It's very bumpy. There's no pavement for another two miles. I don't need pavement. [tires squealing] [in Hindi] They feel this is the correct route. Always follow the good air. Get your phones ready. [in Hindi] Oh, no. -[tires squeal] -[Ramesh in Hindi] They're driving recklessly. Our escape route is around the bend, about one mile. Highway 33. Now's your chance. Let's go. [speaking in Hindi] We're inside. Major Tom, why don't you put your headphones on and find me a pulse. Don't be scared. We haven't lost anyone yet. [Ramesh] Leave me alone. Yeah. [device whirring] [beeping] [thunder rumbling] [Zane] Just keep your eyes up there, you understand? Oh, no. Hey, never mind that, it's just the RFD. Where the hell you going? [rhythmic pulses] [indistinct conversation in Hindi] [rhythmic pulses] [van horn honks] [rhythmic pulses continue] [thunder cracks] [rhythmic pulses intensifies] [high-pitched whine] [thunder rumbles] [screams] [tense music] [van horn honks] [Zane] Get in! And close that door! [radio beeps] Hey, Roy. Please come in. Do you copy? We're on a dirt road about a mile west of Exit 33. [Ramesh in Hindi] Let's go. -[grunts] -[Ramesh in English] Go forward! Hey, I'm gonna push. You drive. I'll get out and push. When I give you the thumbs up, you start to ease back. Okay? [exhales] [pants] [car door closes] [suspenseful music] [grunts] Keep it spinning. Keep it spinning. [grunts] [grunts] [screams] [William] Come on. Come on! -[grunts] -[William] Come on! [screams] Oh, my God. [Zane grunts] [tires screeching] [Zane pants] [pants] [foreboding music] [both panting] [screams] No! [Ramesh] Get in. Get in. Reverse! Reverse! Ah! Can you even drive? I absolutely cannot! [grunts] [dramatic music] Heads down! ♪♪ -[static over radio] -[Roy over radio] Get out of there now! You're in the Bear's Cage! We're heading down 33! -Which mile marker are you on? -I'm going backwards here. How the hell am I supposed to know that? [sirens chirp] [dramatic music] [Ramesh] Brake! Brake! -[tires squeal] -[horn honks] [shrieks] [thunder crashes] -William! -Mom? [pants] -Mom! -[Quinn] Move over. [pants] -[radio beeps] -[Quinn over radio] Follow us. [tires squeal] [Quinn] Where's Zane? Why were you driving? [thunder rumbling] The tornado was right on top of us. It's okay. I'm here with you now. It's okay. Hey. It's gonna be all right. [Roy over radio] South storm ate the North storm. The low-level jet just kicked in. [thunder rumbling] Well, at least it's stopped raining. That's good, right? No. [over radio] We're still in the cage. If we get through McCook, we got a South route, two miles. [thunder rumbling] That... that whole thing's a tornado? [dramatic music] Mom. Fuel, we're low. Forget the South route. We need a shelter now. -The Victory Christian Academy, -[emergency alarm blares] it's two blocks North, three blocks East. [alarm blares] [tires screech] [alarm continues] Where is it, Roy? Hey, over there. -Turn around! Turn around! -[Roy] On it. [tires squeal] [clamoring] [Quinn] We're out of gas. [gasps] You all right? [dramatic music] Harper! Take this. Get inside. Tour is over. Let's go. [Ramesh in Hindi] Please move! Let's go. -[screaming] -[man] Come on! [panting] No, no. Come on. [William pants] What are you doing? Dad's journal is under the seat. What? What? [clamoring] [woman] Get in here! Is Will in there? [Roy] There's no time for that. -No, I can't leave it. -Look, hey! Let it go. [grunts] I'm stuck. -[Roy] What? -[William] I'm stuck. [dramatic music] [Roy] It's your watch! Your watch! Undo it! Undo it! -Come on. Undo it. -[William] It's stuck. [Quinn] Will! [grunts] [Roy grunts] Will! [glass breaking] Come inside! You're gonna die. [William] Roy! [Quinn] Where are you going? [grunts, pants] -[Quinn] Will! -[Roy groans] [William] I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. -[groans] I think I broke something. -[Quinn] You okay? You're gonna make it. [breathes heavily] [Quinn] Oh, my God. The pool. [all pant] [William] All right. All right. [Roy grunts] [Quinn] Hold your breath. Hold your breath. [unsettling music] [muffled screams, crash] [somber music] [man] On my count, ready? -One, two, three. -[all grunt] [speaking in Hindi] How'd y'all plan on getting home? I don't know. Haven't thought about it. [vehicle beeping] Well, at least you know how to drive now. [music swelling] [air brakes hiss] [mechanical squeaking] I lost it. We can build another. Your dad would be proud. I did it for you. [dramatic music]
