[ominous music] [woman] The Department of Justice released their unified crime report today, which statistically details crime in the United States. In the report it indicates there is some form of crime committed every two seconds. A breakdown of category shows an aggravated assault occurs every 33 seconds, a robbery every 55 seconds, a rape every six minutes, and a murder every 24 minutes. In the predawn hours this morning at Kansas, the bodies of two convenient store employees were found faced down after being shot point blank in the back of the head in what police are referring to as an execution-type slain. This was the second set of murders reported in the area and police have found few clues. Jim Ward, who found the victims-- [woman 2] Another convenient store execution was reported last night, but in Nebraska, not Kansas when the two previous incidents occurred. Police have determined all three crimes are related with the apparent goal of robbing the stores and leaving no witnesses. Authorities still have few clues and no description of the assailants. The citizens of Topeka are in a state of shock-- [woman 3] The mini-mart killers have struck again, but this time in Laker, Colorado, three hundred miles east of the last attack with apparently the same mode of execution. Authorities are being guarded about disclosing any information, but believe two to three individuals are involved with the assailants striking in the predawn hours completely at random. Citizens of Laker are outraged at the murder. [woman 4] Police still have no leads on the mini mart killers. The number of times they have struck is now officially up to seven. Authorities have issued a bulletin to all convenient stores in a six-state radius to operate using caution in the late evening and early morning hours. Anyone having information is asked to contact their local authorities. [woman 5] Two groups have issued a report totaling over 20,000 dollars to anyone providing information which leads to the arrest and conviction of these criminals. [crickets chirping] [music on radio] Okay. What's the next town? Edmond. Edmond. Uh, could you believe that last old lady? People become so possessed with material things. Man, that is one huge diamond. Uh, you know what they say, Billy. You take a woman's diamond, it's like taking part of their soul. If you ask me, I think she liked this marquise a whole lot more than she liked that diamond. Well, maybe so. But now she doesn't have to worry about neither one, does she? What's that up there? [Zeke] Looks like some kind of old cemetery. [Billy] Alright! Target practice. [gunshots] Was that gunshots? Oh, probably some farmer shooting coyotes. What's wrong with you? Oh, shoot. There ain't nobody there going to mind. That's all we need for a cop to have heard that. Hey, chill out, man. He's right, Billy. Put your toy away. We don't want to be making any evidence before the game starts. Damn kids never put anything back where they're supposed to be. Well, if it weren't for those damn kids, this store wouldn't stay in business. Nah! [serious music] Customers! [bell] Do you think you can put the candy back in the right boxes? Huh? Oh, sure, old man. Yeah, whatever you say. Can't you people understand that there's an order about this store? And if we all acted like you, I couldn't find anything. [music continues] [woman] Why don't you just have a seat. You're going to make yourself sick and you know what the doctor said about that. Did I hear you say something to my friend, old man? I told him to put back the candy in the right box. He's a little easy to rye. He really don't mean nothing! If you don't like it, get out of here! My, my, my! That's not being very polite! You know, old man, the game of life has its rules, and you are about to learn some of them right now. Get him! [screaming] How many 'L's are in alluded? I mean, is it ah-luded or al-luded? I mean, it sounds like ah-luded, but that just doesn't look right. Why don't you just say, 'referred to'? Oh, alright. How many 'R's are in referred? -How about I just guess? -That's good. You know, you just drive so I could do most of the paperwork. Well, it can wait until we get back, you know. Yeah, sure, but we don't get home until two. That's okay by me. Oh, fine for you, "Mr. Single Guy," but I got a wife and two rug rats, remember? I know. You won't let me forget. Well, now, what is that supposed to mean? It just means that every chance you get, you're showing me those blurry pictures of yours. Alright, alright. What are you trying to say? I'm saying that if you don't want the whole world to think you got a family full of aliens, you should get some better pictures. Oh. You know, you've been driving for a while, you want me to take over? -You know I always drive. -Always drive! Hey, what do you say to a cup of coffee? Yeah. [bell] Hello, can we get some coffee? Is anybody here? [ominous music] Hold it right there! Um... What seems to be the problem, officer? For one thing, you didn't pay for the stuff in your basket. Uh... [gunshots] Drop it! [bell rings] There's one in the back! [ominous music continues] What the hell is going on? The old man and his wife are dead. Shot in the back of the head. Executed? Yeah. Hey, I didn't have nothing to do with that! Then I just suppose you stood by! Well, so what if I did? You ain't got nothing on me! You know, you're right. That's right! You can't pin no murders on me! Just mirandize me and take me in! Turn him around. Well, what do you think? You dumb hick cops. Don't you know your job? Just mirandize me and take me to the station. I tell you, you get picked up by some moron cops in some hick town, takes them forever to figure their job out! Well, if you weren't so stupid, I wouldn't have to tell you, would I? [phone rings] I thought you stopped smoking? I have. Too bad about Harris. Do you believe it? An exclusive interview with the first person to be executed in this state in 24 years, and the governor calls it off on the 11th hour to grant a stay of execution. Maybe you can use the story [inaudible] I was right there in the front row of the gas chamber, for Christ's sake. It's cost me two day's pay to bribe the guard, and then that pansy governor of ours gets cold feet! Maybe he thought he wasn't guilty? Were you listening? It was an exclusive. I mean, how many times for a chance at that? Besides, how innocent could he be? They found parts of 14 boys' bodies beings used as wall insulation. Oh, by the way, did you hear that they caught the mini mart killers? Just came over the wire. Has Jim seen this yet? I don't think so. Good. I'll give this back to you later. Hey, hey! Watch it, will you? So, Harris got a stay of execution. Tough break. Oh, I bet you're real broke up about it. I could've told you that would've happened. Why do you think Deerfield gave you the story and not me? Think about it. The mini mart killers. Two were killed in the shoot out and the other one got away. They killed the store proprietors before the police arrived? Yes, same MO, no witnesses. I think you better send me out to get the story. No, that's Jim's coverage. We'll send him. Can't. Jim's going to Florida on the Janson case, and, well, Bill...Bill's not due back until Friday, and I'm next on the totem pole. And you owe me one. Especially after that "Sheep gives birth to baby boy" article. As I remember, you requested that assignment. Besides, I gave you the Harris case, didn't I? No, you volunteered me for that assignment and you knew that the governor would stay Harris's execution. I just spoke to Jim. Come on, give me a shot at some real news. Okay. But try to get the whole story, not just your opinion this time. -I always do! -My ass! Now, get out of here so you can make that press conference. Thanks. You won't regret this. I already do. [ominous music] Yes, Lisa. Yeah, I'll be alright. No, you don't have to do that. [knocking] Oh, well I have to go now. There's someone at the door. Bye. Hi, how's it going? If you're selling something, I'm not interested. No, no, no. My car broke down. I was wondering if I could use your phone. Just for a minute, please. It's parked around the corner. I think it's my water pump. Well, I could probably take a look at it for you. No, that's okay. Just your phone, please. -It's a local call, isn't it? -Yeah. You know, I really am pretty good with cars. I could tell you for sure if it's your water pump. No, just your phone, please. Thank you. Did you hear who won the Dodger game? No. I used to like to play sports. But I never got interested in watching much. [TV] Boy, I don't know what I'd do without my games. Nice place you got here Mr. uh... Jacobs. Jim Jacobs. My wife died a couple of years ago. Don't you get lonesome? No, I don't care much for people. My granddaughter comes by every once and a while. [TV reporter] Yeah, hello, Bob? Yeah, listen, my car broke down and I was wondering if you could give me a hand. Yeah, yeah, I think it's the water pump. With me now are Officers Madlock and Evans. Tell me, did you know that these were the mini mart killers when you came in? No, I had no [inaudible] then I noticed the blood behind the counter. What you see now is-- Say, what's the cross streets here? -What? -The cross streets. Twenty-second and Riverside. Reporting live from city hall, Fred Bishop. Thank you. Twenty-second and Riverside, Bob. I'll see you in about 20 minutes. Do you have any friends to come by and keep you company? No, I'm afraid most of them have passed away. [tense music] [inaudible] I'm going to do you a favor. I'm going to let you go visit some of your old teammates. And because of the efforts of fine policemen like these, and our police chief who currently is coordinating all the efforts to capture the suspect still at large, our crime rate is 40 percent lower than the rest of the country. Now, I'd like to introduce Cliff Madlock and Jeff Evans the officers that are responsible for the apprehension. Could you describe the chain of events that led up to the shooting? Um, it's exactly like I stated in my report. Um... We entered the store. I noticed a trail of blood leading to the back. We stopped the suspects, they went for their guns. We returned fire and both suspects sustained mortal wounds. I then noticed the third suspect peeking into the back door. I pursued and lost contact with him, that's when I noticed that the proprietors had been executed. In the report, it had stated that Logan the Blond had gone for his gun first, but the police chief had said it was Bartel, which was it? Uh, Bartel. The heavier one I believe is first. It was kind of hard to tell. They both started to draw. [mayor] Thank you, boys. That will be all the time we have. I hope that all of you are able to stay around for a while and enjoy the wonderful hospitality of Edmond. Thank you. Officers! Excuse me, officers? You did quite a job. [Cliff] That's what we're paid for. Is crime down 40 percent like the mayor said? We don't keep track of the statistics. We just get out there and do the best job we can. Yes, but you must be aware-- My partner's right and besides, we're on our way to a meeting, so if you'll excuse us. Crime is down 40 percent-- I'm sorry. We don't have any more time. Thank you. -I'm sorry. -Gentlemen! [slow-paced music] -Hi. -Hi. [chatter] [boy] Hey, check her out. [boy] Hey, look at that man, whoo! Hey, lady! You dropped your [inaudible] Thanks. That's really nice of you. Can I give you a little something? [inaudible] No problem. -No problem. -Thanks. [chatter] -Hi, hon. -Hi. -Can I get you some coffee? -Yes, please. Coming right up. And a pack of [inaudible] [man on TV] -Here you go. -Thanks. -Can I ask you a question? -Sure. Would this be considered a better part of town? Are you kidding? People around here can't hardly make ends meet. You need some more time to order? Yes, please. Thanks. That's the least I could do. Hey, Cliff. What are you having? The same as usual, chicken fried platter, extra gravy and a coke. Coming right up. Thanks. So what's up with you and your partner? What do you mean? I mean, everything being hush hush. You know, I'm in here for a little dinner. That means no discussion of business. I was just asking. You were just looking for a story. You know, if you'd like to sit here and pass some time, that's fine, but if you're a reporter and I'm a cop, I'd assume [inaudible] Deal? Okay, deal. [report] More grisly news from New York today. Corroner trial testimony in the case of accused mass-murderer Warren Smith indicates that the number of victims may be more in the neighborhood of 24, instead of the original estimate of 11. Autopsies of the remains in the shallow graves are indicating more than one dismembered body per grave. Smith has pleaded guilty by reason of insanity as the trial goes into its second month. When we come back-- Gruesome. It's amazing that something like that can even happen. People let it happen. What do you mean? Well, Smith was arrested [inaudible] three years ago, case was dismissed on account of technicality. So what are you saying? [chuckles] -You married? -No. No time for relationships, huh? How about we don't talk about my personal life and I won't talk like a reporter? Well, pretty nice weather we're having, don't you think? No, I haven't had time to devote to make one work. How about you? I was married once. -Had a wife and kid. -Yeah? They were killed in a car wreck four years ago. Oh, I'm sorry. Pretty peaceful town you run here. I don't run it. I'm just a cop. Where I come from, everyone's fighting to death to walk out at night, especially alone. Well, Edmond's not any place. We're kind of a tight little community here, we kind of watch out for one another. You mean, everyone wants the same form of justice? Nelly, I'll be taking my food over to a booth. Listen, I'm sorry about that. I guess it's just in my blood. No, it's just in your ego. Great job, Jill. Great job. Have you decided what you want, hon? I'll have a dinner salad with blue cheese. Coming right up. [phone rings] I'm sorry about that. Here's my name and my number where I work. At least, [inaudible] I wouldn't hold my breath. [sleuth music] Nelly, let me use your phone. Sure. There you go. Yeah, this is Cliff Madlock. Put me through to dispatch. [sleuth music] [music continues] [ominous music] [on TV] I guess you're not going to kill me now, huh? [tense music] Police! Everybody freeze! [inaudible] Police! [screams] [police] Keep your face down! Come on, get down! Police! [Cliff] Get everybody in the living room! Come on, come on! Get up! Get up! [police] Put your hands behind your back! Whoa, settle down, buddy. [Cliff] Alright, bring him here. Lay him over there. Get down, get down! Give me your right hand! Give me your left hand! -[thug] Where's your warrant? -[Cliff] Shut up! Well, what have we got here? What's this? Look at that, Jimmy. You got a new toy. Where's your warrant, man? Right here's your warrant. Get him up. If you don't have a warrant, you can't arrest us, and none of this shit can be used as evidence! What evidence? I don't see any evidence. Do you see any evidence, Jimmy? What are you doing, man? I'm cleaning off your kitchen table. How can you guys eat with all this mess? I get it. You guys want to use this shit yourselves. You know, only loser use dope. Do I look like a loser to you? I'm asking you a question! Do I look like a loser to you? No, man. You don't look like no loser to me. What do you guys want? A cut of the action? Is that it? Jimmy, trade places with Anthony and watch him while I look in the other room. What's this bandana around your arm for, man? You some kind of Crypt or something? Yeah, man, I'm a Crypt. -Where from? -From LA. A big bad Crypt from LA. I'm impressed. [Cliff] Hey, I just got back from the store and got some stuff just for you. I just had a feeling that you might be hungry. What are you doing, man? You know, they were out of some of the stuff you liked, so I had to substitute, I hope you don't mind. Let's see here. What are you doing, man? Well, I know I'm not much of a cook but... -Here you go. -Hey, I can't eat that-- Yeah, sure you can. [inaudible] Huh? Here you go. Yeah, now, isn't that good? [coughing violently] I forgot to give you something to wash that down with. Let's see what we got in here. Here you go, buddy. [chokes] [vomits] Put him in a cuff. I think you can finish the rest by yourself now. Get him up. -Get up. -You right or left handed? Are you right or left handed? [yells] Shit! [inaudible] with your left hand out. Come over here. Yeah, you. Come over here. Shake. Shake! Your buddies don't look too good here, alright. I'd make sure they see a doctor. Maybe a good one [inaudible] Come on, guys. Let's get out of here. Linda! Linda, where the hell are you? In here, Cliff. I told you I didn't want you cleaning up my place. You want my brother to look like he lives with rats? -So? -So? We have a family image to protect. What you need is a wife. I had one of those once, remember? And she was a good one, too. I can do just fine by myself. I can tell, nice drool. I want my pass key back. No. -Oh! -I mean it! I don't want you cleaning up around here anymore. Besides that, what if you walked in on me and a nice lady? A nice lady wouldn't come to a dump like this. Now get off of me! Uh, vacuum the carpet, why don't you? What am I supposed to do for underwear? Turn them inside out. Oh, by the way, talk to Jim about getting on the force. Why do you insist on Jim becoming a cop? 'Cause he hates being a mechanic. You know he can get shot, for Christ's sake. Where is that going to leave you and little Jim? With a pension fund, which we don't have now. Okay, okay, I'll call him for lunch, but I'm not going to promise you anything. Don't get carried away! You're like a damn dog or something! Does this mean I've got to get my underwear tomorrow? Got any clues where he might be? Listen, I've been thinking. Just a coke, thanks. Oh, sure thing, Cliff. You know, I bet he's hiding out in one of those deserted buildings downtown. Oh, you do? Stands to reason. Thanks. What makes you think that? Those people down there don't read the newspapers, they don't even own a television. They don't know what he looks like. Alright, you might have a point there. I know I do. I've been thinking about going down there and checking it out myself. So what are you going to do if you did come across his character? I'd choke him and bring him in. He's got a gun. I used to be a pretty good wrestler in high school. I think I could sneak up behind him and get him in a half Nelson. At least hold him there until the cops get there. [inaudible] The chances are this guy will blow your brains out before [inaudible] It's just a thought. Linda says you might be able to get me on the force. Look, Jim, you're a bright guy. Why do you insist on getting a job where you might get killed? Linda's tired of being married to a grease monkey. She keeps talking about pensions. Suppose you came across a guy that you know just killed somebody in cold blood. I think I can handle it. Could you? I know the policy. You can count on me. Alright. I'll see what I can do. I got a meeting with the mayor. I got to go. I thought today was your day off? It is, but there's something they want to talk to me about. -Take care. -Okay. Hello, Mayor. It's been a while since you graced us with your presence down here at the station. Shut up, Madlock. Still don't care for politicians, huh? Where have you been? Well, it is my day off. I just had a visit from a lady reporter from Populous magazine. She claims that our police force is not abiding by the law. They saw you leaning on that drug pusher last night. I tried to cover up, but... I'm afraid we're going to have to change our style of doing things for a while. -We want you to do us a favor. -A favor? [clears throat] We don't want the suspect killed. -The one that got away? -That's right. I'm afraid it might publicly open up a can of worms. There's just too many damn reporters in town. You know this guy's got a record as long as my arm. Madlock, you're not telling us anything we don't already know. Thanks. I knew we could count on you boys to circulate the message around. Oh, sure, Mayor. Say, can we sweep your office, too? We just love doing your dirty work. Chief, we got a meeting to go to. You know god gave you the brains of a jackass if you don't know any better than to backtalk to the mayor! I need to drive around the Hawthorn neighborhood and see if I can't spot our friend. -You want to come along? -No. I have to testify on my day off. A fact you don't seem to remember conning me into. -Did I do that? -Yeah, "Did I do that?" Hi, I need to see all your criminal records involving armed robbery, rape, murder, and drug seizure in the last two years. The last two years? Well, okay. -Come this way. -Great. [sleuth music] -Here's some more. -Thank you. [sighs] [tense music] [whistling] [chuckles] [ominous music] Grandpa, you in there? [knocking] Grandpa? Grandpa? Grandpa, where are you? [tense music] -[groans] -What are you doing? My, my! [whistles] Oh, boy. He sure did pass on some good DNA! What'd you do to my grandpa? Oh, I'm afraid his heart just wasn't in the game anymore. It gave out on him. He's quite dead now. Take off your shoes. Yeah. Take off your jacket. Now the dress. Mm. Now, don't worry. Everything's going to be alright. [tense music] Somebody help me! Somebody help me! Somebody stop! [screaming] Stop! Somebody stop! [tires screech] Stop! Stop! Help me! Help me! He killed my grandpa! Take it easy, take it easy! Where? Which house? Right there! Second from the left? Stay here. Shit! [ominous music] [gunshot] What are you going to do now? Wait a minute. You're the one in the store right? Madlock! Let the girl go. Go ahead and shoot. Even if you do hit me, I'll kill her! Give up and I'll take you in. [laughs] That's a joke. You blew away my partner. He tried to escape! You save that one for the papers! I was there, remember? He surrendered and you blew him away! Julie! Oh! Oh, god! I wouldn't if I were you! -Mommy! -Shut up! Give up and I'll take you in. You'll get me killed! [laughs] That's a nice-looking shirt. I particularly like it right around the collar. [mom] Let her go! Shut up, you! Alright, here's a game plan. You drop your gun and I let her go. Then you'd blow me away. I guess so, yeah. Okay, I'll tell you what. You go behind the fence for cover, as you're running, you drop down your gun. Does that sound fair? Yeah, real fair. -[mother] Oh, please! -Well, do it! [cries] [tense music] [gunshots] [tires screech[ [judge] Jimmy, hand me Mr. Johnson's file. Ann, could you take care of these? Mr. Clairmont. Could I see you up here for a moment, please? [whispering] I'm looking through your file on this case, Mr. Clairmont, and I fail to find any new evidence. Your honor, the case is cut and dry. It's just one for the books. Alright. Let's get on with it. Hey, beautiful. What are you doing here? I didn't think you were allowed to talk to reporters. Well, now where did you get that idea? Hey, you want to see a picture of my family? Oh. Do you have a picture that's a little less blurry? You know, you and Madlock have a lot in common. What is that supposed to mean? Oh, forget it. Does the defense wish to call any witnesses to the stand? Yes, Officer Jeff Evans. Showtime. You sure this guy's on our side? What are you so nervous about? Just relax. That's easy for you to say. But I lived in this town long enough to know that if they say I go to trial, I won't make it back to my cell. You're innocent, right? Then just relax and let justice prevail. [sighs] You were the officer at the scene along with your partner, Officer Madlock? Yes, sir. When you arrived at the scene, what did Mr. Johnson tell you? That he was being robbed and that a scuffle ensued. He turned the gun on the thief and fired. Was there any evidence that this case was not, as Mr. Johnson pleads, a case of self-defense? No, sir. Not that we could find, um, in fact, the victim had a holster for the firearm. So then there is no evidence which would indicate that he acted in an inappropriate manner? That's correct, we could find no evidence of any wrongdoing by Mr. Johnson. He was being robbed and he took appropriate action. In fact, he called the ambulance and the police. Did he cooperate fully when he was taken in and held for questioning? -Yes, sir. -Hm. And you had no previous knowledge of Mr. Hartford's connection with Mr. Johnson? No, sir. Thank you. No more questions. [judge] You may step down now, Officer Evans. Are they going to kill my daddy? Well, don't be talking like that. Your daddy's a good man. Well, they better not, 'cause he's the only one I got. [judge] Does the prosecution wish to call anymore witnesses to the stand? No more questions, your honor. [judge] Alright, I believe I have enough evidence to make a decision. I'm going to look through the rest of the incident report and give my opinion in a few moments. This case doesn't have a chance in hell. So why was it brought up? Well, the law says that you got to have a hearing. You know, I've been going through some past court cases. Why is it that this town has such a low crime rate but almost never convicts a criminal? Well, um... The police make sure that justice is served. What do you mean? Well, have you walked around this town, Ms. Weatherby? Yeah, I've been here a couple of days now. Have you seen the old people out on the streets at night? You know, people leave their doors unlocked, they aren't afraid of one another like they are in the big city. Police, they just take pride making sure that stays that way. Even if it means denying constitutional rights like at the drug house? [chuckles] Well, now, I don't know anything about that. But you tell me. Would you rather live in a society where law-abiding citizens live in fear... or the criminals do? Ms. Weatherby, I don't remember talking to you today. In fact, I don't even remember seeing you here. But you know, for somebody I don't remember seeing, you sure look pretty. Goodbye. [judge] Quiet, please. Due to the small amount of tangible evidence relating to this case, and the fact that the connection between the defendant and the victim is purely circumstantial. I hereby fine this case unsuitable to go to trial. [clapping] Court is adjourned. [child] Daddy. -[groans] -Oh, a little bit tight? Depends on how much pain you want me to be in. There we go. You know, three more inches, Madlock, and, uh, you'd have another chamber in your heart. How do you know he has one? No one's been able to find it yet. Doc, this is my sister. Brought your shirt. Uh, you know, your brother will never grow up. He's still playing cops and robbers. From what I hear, he likes to play doctor a lot, too. So this is what you want your husband involved in? He's not stupid enough to step in front of a bullet. Besides, he only wants to be a ticket giver. That's not what he told me at lunch. He's just trying to feed you some macho bullshit to swirl your head. Well, the bedside manner, you two leave something to be desired. Oh, just what I needed. Sorry about your shoulder. You're not half as sorry as I am. So are you going to introduce me? I believe it's Jill. My sister, Linda. She works for some magazine. Populous magazine. Oh. Well, now that I've found out for the rest of the family that you're still alive, I think I'll go shopping. I'm glad you can drop by and cheer me up. Don't mention it. Nice meeting you. You can put your shirt on now. -Let me help you. -I can get it. Have you got something against me? Yeah, you're a reporter. Why are you so scared to talk to a reporter? What do you think I'm going to do, slander your name? Lady, I've never heard of a national reporter that's got anything good to say. They're always looking for something bad. That's a rotten attitude! Well, as my Aunt Martha used to say, if something ain't broke, don't fix it. What's that supposed to mean? [woman] Dr. Rollin, please call the operator. Dr. Rollin, please call the operator. [glass shatters] [ominous music] [chuckles] [whistling] Do you think that works? Yeah, that's how we feel about it. -Yes. -Great, thank you. Excuse me, excuse me. I'm from Populous magazine. I'd like to ask you a couple of questions. I buy that magazine at the store all the time. Do you think it's really possible for a sheep to give birth to a human baby? Oh, I don't really know. I'm in the crime edition. Oh, you don't say? Now, what I'd like to ask you is do you feel safe in your town? -Why of course. -Yes, yes, of course we do. Why do you feel that way? Well, because this is a town of justice. Oh, what my husband means is that our police and courts... [ominous music] ...and lower crime rate. Mm-hm, criminals in the meaner element, they know to stay out of our town. Uh, they don't come in. Well, what do you think of the mini-mart killers? Well, two of them got what they deserve, and I hope they get that other one. Thank you both very much. Oh, don't mention it. Could you please show me your driver's license? Is anything wrong? Could you please step out of the car? I'm a reporter for the Populous magazine. I'm here reporting on the mini-mart killers. That was a couple of days ago. Yeah, I'm doing a follow-up for my magazine. Step aside. I don't follow. And why? Your town has such a good statistic of crime. You both must be aware that... have one of the lowest in the country. Is this your license? Of course it is. It's me on the picture. This is a picture of a lady with dark hair. Yes, I mean, I had darker hair. Have I done something wrong? Can I see your car registration? Stay here a moment, Ms. Weatherby. Sorry, [inaudible] I'd like to know what's going on. We have to double check all strangers in town. There's a killer is at large. Do I look like the killer type? I don't know, do you? No. Good night. [engine starts] [ominous music] So what did you find out? She's just doing a little innocent reporting. That's all we can tell. So what do you want us to do? Just your normal [inaudible] Mistake. [ominous music] Okay, Madlock. You're about to get your last chance at bat. Well, come on in. We'll only stay for a little while. It's already dark, what if he's got somebody in there? Then I'd definitely want to go in. No wonder your brother thinks you're a pain in the ss. [hushes] Surprise! [Zeke] Strike three, sport. [gunshots] [screaming] Why? Why? -Who's he? -My husband! Gee, that's too bad. Who are you? Linda! Oh, so you're the one in the picture. -Yeah, you're Madlock's sister. -Yes! Well, the score's going to be tied setting us into extra innings. [man on recorder] That's my judgement. I was reading the other day that it takes death penalty cases eight years to get a decision in the state supreme court. [Jill] But you're not suggesting that the death penalty is a deterrent? [man] Oh, how would we know? No one's been executed in this state in 26 years. And with the death penalty, we know that that particular individual wouldn't be able to kill again. [phone rings] Hello? -Is this Jill Weatherby? -Yes, it is. -Populous magazine? -Yes, who is this? This is the guy that everybody's looking for. Look, I'm not into games. Tell me who you are and what you want. Not into games, huh? Jesus, isn't there anybody into sports around here? Look, I'm the killer and I want you to help me. The mini-mart killer? Hey, you're pretty bright. Now, shut up and listen. The cops gunned down my partners. They didn't have a chance. -In cold blood? -Yeah, that's right. You can't get a fair deal in this town. If I turn myself in, I'm a dead man. I want you to help me get to Jackson. Why should I trust you? Because I need you. You're going to make me a famous player. You are going to get an exclusive interview with the famous mini-mart killer. Why don't you give yourself up publicly? Because they'll kill me in jail before I go to trial. Alright. I'll interview you. And then we use the interview as leverage to get you to another town, deal? Maybe. Look, I'll call you back, okay? -When? -When I feel like it. Oh, by the way, if I find out that you've been talking to the coppers, you're going to acquire a nice little slit across your pretty little throat. Okay? Do you got that? [dial tone] [phone rings] -Hello? -Jill Weatherby, please. Boss, you're not going to believe what just happened. I know I can't believe you're still in that hick town. Listen, you know the killer that escaped? He just got through calling me and he wants me to do an interview. -Are you nuts? -Dead serious! He's going to give me an exclusive interview. Why you? I don't know and I don't care as long as I get it! You're in way over your head. I think I better send Jim down. If you do, you'll read about it in another magazine. Alright, alright. Just be careful. -I always am. -My ass. Bye, boss. [serious music] [Zeke] ...you're going to acquire a nice little slit across your pretty little throat. Okay? Do you got that? [inaudible] Cliff! Cliff! I want the policy enforced. I haven't the authority to do that. The hell you don't. I can understand how you feel, I feel the same way. Then change it. There's too much pressure. This is national news, if mean, if we slip up, everything we worked for could go down the drain. You know, I'm tired of you guys sending policy that we cops in the street have to dish out. Madlock, that girl reporter from that magazine is asking a lot of pointy questions. -This doesn't concern you. -I'm sorry. The mayor and I have already discussed this. You two are going to have to split up -until after the inquiry. -What? Hey, I guess we're going to get traffic duty, too, right? That's right, however, we suggest that you, because of what happened to your sister, take some sick leave, maybe a couple of weeks off. "Suggest?" Take it more as an order. -You've got to be kidding. -I wish I was. This whole thing has gotten out of hand. The only thing out of hand here is yours and the mayor's thinking. I know you've gone through a lot, Madlock, but don't push me! I wouldn't think of it. Report to Sergeant Wilcox. He has your orders. You got something to say? Well, if it isn't cub reporter. I am really sorry about your sister. Can I come in? I really don't feel like being interviewed right now. I'm not interviewing, I just want to talk. Alright, if that's the case, come on in. I doubt we'll make good conversation. I heard you were taken off duty. Well, word sure travels fast. It just happened two hours ago. Well, I don't think it's right of them. Oh, can I quote you on that? You know, I'm not a reporter twenty four hours a day. Well, excuse me, I guess I haven't been very nice to you. Not terribly nice now. Well, I guess that comes from being an asshole. I don't think you're an asshole. Well, maybe you ought to call some of my ex-girlfriends and let them tell you about it. Would you like a coke or a beer or something? Coke would be great. Coke. Coke we got. Is this a picture of your wife? Which one? On the table? Yes. -Yep. -Pretty lady. Your son was a good-looking boy, too. Yeah, my sister was a beautiful person, too. Look, Ms. Weatherby, you didn't come all the way over here to ask me about my tragedies, now what the hell do you want? I did come over here to give you my sympathies about your sister. Well, I won't lie, I need your opinion about something. What? If the mini-mart killer turned himself in, would he go to trial? You're asking the wrong guy for that, B. No. I want to know what you think. Why? Why are you so curious about it? -It's a viable option, isn't it? -No. Not with him it's not. He'd never do it. How do you know? Well, do you have information on the contrary? No. Then what the hell did you come over here for? My sister was just killed by this guy and you want my opinion? -I'm just curious. -Oh, you're curious? You know, you're the type that would put a camera on some guy who's just lost his son in a drowning. Or a woman who's just lost her baby in a fire? Get out of here. Get out of here you bloodsucker. -Get out. -I didn't mean-- Get out! I really am sorry about your sister. I bet. [train horn] [phone rings] -Hello? -Hi. Did you miss me? Who is this? You know damn well who this is? This is the guy that's going to make you famous. I wouldn't be so sure of that. Have you thought about my preposition? Yes? And after a little research, I don't think you would get a trail. I told you the game's in this town were rigged! Okay, here's the game plan. At midnight, I want you to meet me in the back alley behind Jim's Deli on fifth street. Jim's Deli on fifth. How will I know how to approach you? You won't, I'll find you. After I've made sure you're not trying to set me up. So will I do the interview there? When we're on the road. Wait a minute, that wasn't the deal. Hey, deal's change. No way. Look, do you want the story, yes or no? Come on! Come on! I haven't got all day. Okay, I'll be there. By the way, if you try to screw me over, just remember your pretty little throat. You got it? [ominous music] [sleuth music] [music continues] [music continues] [Zeke] How's it going, Madlock? Give me the gun. Now, walk towards the girl. What are you doing here? I think the question is more like what are you doing here? It's not nice for teammates to put each other down in the middle of a game. You two have both given me a chance to hit a grand slam home out of this town! I see you got a shave and that shirt looks familiar. I figured it was time for a new uniform. You, get over on the other side. Come on! Let's go! And you, you're driving. Let him get in first. Alright. I want you to drive south towards Jackson. Come on! When we reach the roadblock, Madlock, you say nothing to nobody unless spoken to. If they ask us any questions, the broad and I are reporters. Anything, anything goes wrong, and I start shooting and ask questions later. Do you understand? -Are you going to kill us? -No. You're going to make me famous, don't you remember? What about Madlock? If he behaves like a nice little boy, maybe I won't hurt him. And just remember, I'm back here. [serious music] [chatter] Oh, hey, beautiful! Partner! What are you doing with her? I got to take these two reporters to the airport in Jackson. [Jeff] Oh, good golly. It's a little late, isn't it? We got to meet some friends on the redeye from Chicago. Oh, okay. Go ahead. That is just fine. Now, at the next big intersection, I want you to make a right. That's highway 45. I thought we were going to Jackson. Well, there's been a slight change of plan. We're going to Coopersville. They got a great little ballpark there. Can I have a smoke? No. Don't you know that this stuff can kill you? Great, I'm having a nicotine fit here. I'm with him, no smoking. Who's side are you on? [laughs] Okay, the ballpark should be coming up soon. It's just on the outskirts of town. When you see it, I want you to pull in. Get out of the car and put your hands on the roof. Stay over there. [gunshot] Let's go. I thought you were going to give yourself up. Winners never give up, do they? Is that what you call yourself now, a winner? My, my, my! -I thought you're on my side? -I was never on your side. I just wanted you to have a fair trial. Lady, you just wanted the story. You wanted the byline of Jill Weatherby splashed across the nation as the broad that got the scoop. Yeah, well, what happened to our deal? You should know better than to trust a player on the opposing team. Let's go. Get in. Let's go, Madlock. Move it! Give me the keys. Move. Over there. You know, it's too bad we really didn't get to know each other. We could've become good friends. When I make my move, run. He'll follow me. [gunshot] Move it. There's a ramp up ahead. -Go to your right. -[Jill] To the right? What do we got here, an echo? Move. For a small town, this ain't a bad little ballpark. We like it. I bet you do. Why'd you bring us up here for? Oh, I figured they wouldn't smell you until the next home game. Does that mean you're going to kill us in cold blood? No, no, no, I'm a sporting guy, I'm going to give you guys a chance like you didn't give me. Stay right there. Go for it. That's not much of a choice. Oh, it's the only choice you've got. [tense music] [gunshot] Oh, shit! [tense music] [gunshot] [door squeaks] [door squeaks open] [yells] Bitch, Madlock! You're a dead man! Oh, what do we got here? Some field lights. [tense music] Yoo-hoo! Oh, Madlock! I'm not going to kill you quick. I'm going to make you suffer! You're going to beg me to kill you! What's the matter, Madlock? The door's locked? Come on out! [gunshots] Come on out and play! There's no sense in hiding, Madlock! Come on out and take it like a man! Come on! 'Atta boy. Come on! You know, I was getting to be a little bit worried. But I'm glad we're going to be able to finish the game. Drop the gun or I'll shoot! My, my, my! Look who we got here! You're supposed to report the news, not make it! Stay right there! So you want to be a player? Well, go ahead, shoot. Stay back, I mean it! Come on! Come on! You're in the big leagues! You got to take a chance so shoot! I'll shoot! I swear to god, I'll shoot! I'm still here! [laughs] You didn't think I'd give you a loaded gun, did you? I could've gotten shot! How can you be such a slime? Oh, I find it makes life very interesting. Come on! Come on up to the batter's box. It's the final of the night! I'm afraid our little game is going to have to end. [serious music] Don't you just love sports? It's the bottom of the 90. Dodgers leading four to three. Runner's on second and third. Hershiser barrels in! Checks in with the catcher. Checks the runner over at third. [spits] Into his wind-up... And the pitch. [tense music] [gunshot] How'd you know? Partner, you always drive, remember? Yeah. [serious music] I guess this means that you're the winner. With you, nobody wins. Madlock! [gunshots] It's over. Is he dead? I'd say so. Damn! There goes my exclusive! What? You just killed the biggest story of my life! Did I miss something here? I thought we were trying to kill the bad guy a few minutes ago? Look, I won't blow the cover of your town if you will agree that we were working in conjunction to apprehend the killer. What are you trying to say? You see, that way, I get my story and your town remains the same and... Well, you'd become a great big hero, what do you say? -Give me the keys. -Not a chance. Remember the mini-mart? And the drug house can all be forgotten. You don't have much of a choice. Give me the keys. I'm supposed to trust you? Yeah, this time you can. Hey, lady. Where do you get your morals? The same place every good reporter does. [reporter] In the pre-dawn hours this morning, the last of the mini-mart killers met his demise in a shootout at Coopersville Ball Park outside of West Bend, Missouri. This, after alluding police for nearly a week in the community of Edmond, Missouri. Jill Weatherby, a reporter for Populous Magazine, worked closely in conjunction with the local police department in what was considered a dangerously bold attempt to lure the killer from hiding. Although details of the actual plan were guarded, the mayor's office issued a statement applauding the efforts of Cliff Madlock and Jeff Evans as the officers at the scene. Zeke Avery, the killer, who's ironically, an ex-minor league ball player, who is on parole after serving time on sentences including rape, assault, and armed robbery. [ending music]
