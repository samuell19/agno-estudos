So in "My Last Duchess", the narrator keeps a painting of his murder victim behind a curtain that only he has the power to open. Student: Psycho. Yeah. A total psycho, but a very charming one. However, in "Porphyria's Lover" the murderer is actually a madman who wants to prolong a perfect moment with his lover by killing her. [DING] On that note, your papers are due on Friday. Do not forget - especially you. Goodbye. Bye. [door slams shut] [gasps] Oh my god. You scared me. [laughs] Hi. Hi. I just could not wait another minute to see you. Well, we.. did you come here to have lunch with me? Uh, you know, tempting as that is, I've actually got to get back to work. So, hold on a second. You came all the way here to give me a kiss? Yeah. I kind of did. Oh my god, you're amazing. Mmm. Wow. Some kiss, though. Yeah. It was. [inhales sharply] Raf... [laughs] You forgot your coat. Hey, are you, uh, free tonight? Yes. Yes, I am. Violet is going to a party and then she's spending the night at a friend's house. We'll have the whole night to ourselves. I'll call you later. -Okay. This is so pretty. Had it.. hold on. Oh, I can't quite hold... This is really hard. [laughs] Um, hello. [gasps] You found it! -I did. Promise me you won't get anything on it, okay" -Promise. And you have to clean your room tomorrow. -I promise. Okay, good. [phone ringing]. I'll get it. Need some help? -[laughs] Yes. Oh. Hi, Raf. Mom, it's for you. Raf, she'll just be a second. Hey. -Hey, Violet. Hey, so I hear you're going to a party tonight. Is that guy you like, Mike, gonna be there? Um, yeah. I mean.. I mean, I hope so. Well, just remember what I told you. Always gotta play- -Play hard to get. I know. Did my mother tell you to say that to me again? [laughing] No way. It's true, though, Violet. Guys, they, uh, they love the chase. Okay. Um, now Raf, I'm going to give you a little bit of advice, okay? Hit me. -You can let life lead you where it wants sometimes. Not everything has to be perfect. -Duly noted. Have I told you, Violet, you are wise beyond your years? -Thank you. -Yes, hard to get. Hard to get is good. Play very hard to get. I love the advice you give her. And I loved that kiss. Me too. So listen, the girls are going to leave soon, um, why don't you come over around eightish? Yeah. About that... um.. Listen, I just got a call that I have to fly to Tokyo in the morning and I got a ton of work I gotta get done before then. So... Um, okay. -But I'm going to make it up to you. when I get back, I've got a really special night planned for us. I'll miss you. Yeah, yeah, I'll miss you- I'll miss you too. Um, travel safe. Bye. We're off. Seriously, already? -What? Get over here. [car honking] That's Carrie, we gotta go, we gotta go. -Okay, fine. Go. But, no texting and driving. I'll tell her. You girls look out for each other, and don't go into any rooms alone with boys. I know. I know. Mrs. Fieri, you don't have to worry. Violet can use the safe word that we use when we need rescuing, like if a guy gets too aggressive. Or like super boring. -It's not funny. We just say "cotton candy", and that's our clue to get each other out of there. Cotton candy... that was your safe word when you were a little girl. Yes. You remember. I love you. Okay, we're going. Stop, you're ruining my makeup. -Okay, girls. Have fun. We will, bye! -But not too much. [laughing] Hey, Cam. Hey. Brunch tomorrow? Yeah. I'll bring the bagels. Yes! [door closes loudly] Raf? Raf, are you here? Raf? [loud noise from upstairs] Raf? Raf? [door closing downstairs] [sigh] [loud noise] [dog barking in the distance] [knocking] Raf? Are you in here? Hello? What is this? Hunter... What... [loud camera shutter] [loud camera shutter] [suspenseful music] [loud camera shutter] [suspenseful music] [gasping] Oh my god. What is going on? [rapid loud camera shutter] [door closes] Ah.. [door locks] Camille, Camille... It wasn't supposed to happen this way. Rafael, what's going on? what is this? You've ruined it. I had a big night planned for us when I got back from Tokyo. Now it's all ruined. So I guess tonight's gonna have to be the night. Rafael, you're not making any sense. You're scaring me. What's happening? The night for what? Actually, tonight might be perfect. You're obviously ready... or else you wouldn't have come over here wearing that... if you weren't ready. Ready for what? Now Camille. I need you to tell me that you love me. What? [sobbing] Don't act like you don't know. I saw it in your eyes, earlier. You were ready to give me your entire self, not just your body, your heart. The way you looked at me after you found that ring... In fact, why don't you just put this on? [suspenseful music] Oh my god. -Just put this on. [crying] Oh my god, you're insane. Not. Insane. Camille! [suspenseful music] I just enjoy the hunt... the thrill of the chase... and, of course, the kill. I need you to tell me you love me. Just say those words. [phone ringing] It's Violet. It's Violet. -Do not answer that! Hi, baby. [dance music] Mom? Is everything okay? Yes, everything's fine, we're being totally safe. It's fine. Mom, are you okay? Oh baby, I'm fine. I'm just a little bit tired right now, that's all. I'm just going to lay down, maybe have a glass of wine and some of that cotton candy we got. [ominous music] I love you, Violet. I love you too, mom. Hey, Jonah just came with a really cute friend. Lisa, my mom just said "cotton candy" on the phone. You think she was saying it as a joke? No, there's no way she'd say it as a joke. She taught me that you only say the safe word if you're in trouble. I'm going to call 9-1-1. [ominous music] Yeah... That's good. Now, say the words, Camille. Say the words... Say it. You want me to tell you I love you? -Yes. You know I love you. Rafael, put down the knife. Please. Please... Auugh! [suspenseful music] Help! Help! Please help me. The guy in there is trying to kill me. [door bangs open and shut] I was so scared. I'm so glad you're okay. -Thank you. I love you. Okay. You can relax. We found him. [exhales] I'm-I'm so glad that he's going to be locked up, right? Like, he can't.. he can't get out and come after me again? We're going to do everything that we can. Now we found a lot of evidence at his house, but there's one thing that we need to ensure that we get him, and get him all the way... Your testimony. Well if.. if that's going to put him away, then of course. Of course you have my testimony. -Great. I was terrified. And everything is-is kind of a blur. He put the knife up to my throat, and then he tried to kill me. And is this the knife he was holding? Yes, it is. ♪ You really have nothing to say? Well, in that case, we'll proceed to sentencing. I hereby sentence you to serve eight consecutive life sentences with no chance of parole. One for every one of the brutal and callous murders you're being convicted for. And though you're not human enough to give us the locations of all your victims, at least the families now have some form of closure as to what happened to their loved ones. I must say that I'm happy that society will never have to see your face again. [bangs gavel] [ominous music getting louder] Oh, yum! Mmm. What do you think about this? Um, for your Sweet 16 party, what if you invited a bunch of girls and you did like a spa day or something, there's an article in here says it's like- spa days are like a big Sweet 16 trending thing now. It's like supposed to be super cool. Uh, are you sure it doesn't say a Sweet 60 party? Might be fun for the two of you. [both gasp] That is so rude. That is.. -Nah, I'm just kidding, I'd just rather have something here and just maybe invite some friends and like maybe- and Jolie, you could make, um, those little cakes that you made for mom's birthday last year. I would love to. Yeah? Oh, awesome. -Yeah. Okay, I just want to text Lisa to make sure she thinks that sounds cool. -Make sure she thinks it's good even though you have like forever to decide. [doorbell] "I gotta do it now!" Hold on. I'm just excited! [laughing] Hi. Camille Fiore? Mm-hmm. I'm agent Halloran, this is agent Kramer.. with the FBI. Okay. May we come in and speak with you please? Why? It's about Rafael DuPont. He's escaped from prison. And judging by the drawings that he's done of you in jail, we believe that he's coming after you. So you think that these sketches are the reason that-that Rafael is after me? -Yes, they are. -It's not just that. Serial killers don't like to leave unfinished business. You're the one who got away, so to speak. I-I don't, I don't understand. You told me that if I.. if I testified that he would be put away for life. That's what you told me. He's a very intelligent man. We believe that he started planning his escape the moment he entered prison. He seduced a guard and she helped him escape. I'm sorry. Due to the fact that it was your testimony that helped secure his sentence, we'd like to temporarily offer you our protection. Okay. -A new identity. A new city. A new life. Just until we can get him into custody again. Wait, you're talking about witness protection? -No. No-no. We-we can't, we can't do that. We're not just going to move and go to a new city. This is where our lives are and this is home and where school and-and my friends and we shouldn't have to go away. We're not the criminals! Tell- tell them that we're not gonna go. Oh. I'm not going! I'm not! [door slams] Okay, she's right. She-she's right. Our lives are here, my job is here, my dad is here, he's very ill, he's in a nursing home. I.. I see him every week. I-we can't leave. I mean, Cam, I could visit your dad. I would go every week, just until you got back. The WITSEC program has successfully protected over 18,000 people.

[trunk slams shut] [car starts] Here's your new ID cards - social security, birth certificates and license under the names Lillie and Emilee Connors. I'm also going to give you one of these. My number's already programmed in under "Uncle Frank". -Okay. Is one of those for me? -Yeah. Not like I have anyone to call. Nope, not yet. Now you both know how important it is to not contact anyone from the past, right? -Yes. I know. I'm not stupid. Violet? Violet! I'm sorry, she's not normally like this. It's just... It's perfectly normal. She'll be fine. Once she starts school she'll make new friends. Speaking of which, your daughter's modified school transcripts haven't come in yet. As soon as they do, she can start. Until then, just get settled in and start practicing your new identities. Are there any leads on Rafael? Have you heard anything? -No. Not yet. But I don't want you to worry. Everyone on this team is working on it. As soon as he shows his face, we'll get him. -Okay. Very nice... Yes, very nice, Mr. DuPont. It's all looking like it's healing up very well. It's only been ten days, but it all looks very good. The cheek implants, the chin, very nice. You'll be able to have those bandages off and go out in public in no time. I must say I've never done such an extensive facial revision before. Once those bandages come off you'll be completely unrecognizable. You'll be able to leave the country without fear of being arrested.

Here we are. You all ready for your first day of school? "Hi, I'm Emilee Connors from Miami, Florida. Go Dolphins." Okay, listen, if um, if anybody asks you anything today that you can't answer, just turn it around on them 'cause people like to talk about themselves, and if you run into any problems, just-just come and find me. Um, I'm in room 202. -Great. Nothing like having your mom at school in order to make new friends. Don't come in with me. Brill? -Here. Corbin? -Here. Chartier? -Here. Connors? Lillie Connors? Oh.

Come on, babe, it's gonna get better. It really will, this is just the first day. [bell rings] I'll meet you in the parking lot after school. Hey, I'm going to run in and get some groceries, do you want to come with me? -No. -Okay. Keep the doors locked. Violet? Violet? Violet! We'll find your owner. We will find your owner. Violet, you cannot run away like that, not with everything that's going on, babe. Okay, okay, mom. But look who I found. It's just I saw this dog walking around and just- isn't he adorable? Look at him! -Yes, he's adorable. Whose dog is it? I don't know. I just saw him walking and I asked around but nobody knows who his owner is. -See if he has a tag. Oh, good thinking. Oh, yep, there is a number. -Okay, hold on. -Hello. Hi. Uh, we have your dog. Wha-ha-ha - you found him? Oh, thank goodness. I've been looking everywhere for him. Thank you. Whereabouts are you guys? I'll come get him. Uh, we are across the street from the ice cream shop on Main Street. Okay, perfect. I'll be there in two minutes, thanks. Yes. Yes, you're so sweet. Hey, buddy. Hello. [laughing] Hey, buddy. Hey. How you doing? I can't believe you found him. Thank you so much. I mean I don't know what I'd do if anything happened to Hemingway, he's like my little baby, you know? Hemingway? Yeah. Hemingway. I know it's a ridiculous name, but I'd just finished reading The Sun Also Rises so it was the first name that came to mind, you know? No, no. It-it's a great name. -Yeah. Well, I'm Brian Whitaker, by the way. I just moved into my granddad's ranch up on the corner of town here up on Waring Road. -Oh, well, I'm Emilee, this is my daughter Lillie, and uh, we are also new to this place. Oh, yeah? Where you from? Um, from Florida, um, yeah. Florida? Wait a minute, I'm from Florida. I've worked there a lot. What part? By the ocean. You- you said you're not from here? No. No-no, I'm, like I said, I'm here to see my granddad, he wasn't feeling too good, and, well, there was no one else to look after him so here I am and unfortunately, things took a turn for the worse. The doctors recommended that I put him in a home. So, yeah, that's what I'm dealing with right now, I'm not sure if it's a mistake and- I don't know. Yeah, yeah, we totally get that. Yeah. Well, my dad is also in a nursing home, he used to live with us, and then his dementia got really bad. It was probably the hardest decision I ever made - but.. it's been great. They've been wonderful to him. Yeah, they're-they're so great to them, they take them on field trips all the time. Like last month, for example, they went to see the Philadelphia Orchestra. The Philadelphia Orchestra? From Miami? [laughs] That's quite the field trip. Yes, but the Philadelphia Orchestra came to Florida and then they took them on this field trip. He had such a good time. -That sounds great. Well, I'll tell you what. I'm about to go get some ice cream. You ladies care to join? -Oh, no thank you, we really have to go but it was a pleasure meeting you, Brian. -Thank you, thank you. Okay. All right. -And thanks. Yes, of course. Bye, Hemingway. Say goodbye. See ya. I'm so sorry, mom. I don't know how I made such a stupid mistake. -Oh, baby. It's all right. It's fine. I've been doing the same thing all day. I don't even know where I am anymore. -It's just so hard to meet new people and keep track of all the lies I'm supposed to be telling. -Hey, it's okay.

So not only do we have to completely start over, but we don't get to visit grandpa when he's dying? -Sweetie... Sweetheart. Hi. Oh, hi-hi. Teenagers. Yeah. Yeah, she's- she's having a really hard time adjusting. I-I think it was a mistake moving here. -Oh no, come on, I wouldn't say that. Eh, look, to be honest, the only thing she really needs is a good day of horseback riding. Really? Is that what she needs? -Yes, maybe you both do, if you want me to be honest. Really? -Yeah. I know you're from the big city, Emilee, right, but I'm gonna let you in on a little secret, okay? Horseback riding can solve a lot of problems. I-I did not know that. -Well, it's true. And look, for what it's worth, we offer riding lessons for the kids at the ranch, and I don't know what to tell you, you know? Try it out, maybe she'll love it, Maybe you both will. What do you say this weekend, give it a shot? I say we'll give it a shot. -Okay. We'll do it. -Okay. Good to see you. Good to see you, too. -Okay. Bye. You see the trick is to actually have the horses get to like you before you ride them. Right there is good. [gasp] But how are they supposed to get to know us if we're all the way over here? Well, you see, horses are very smart animals. They can read people from very far away. They're prey animals, humans are predators, so the horses have to read people very carefully. I mean, come on, you've heard the saying, right? You can never lie to a horse. We're doomed. -You want to say hi? Yeah. -Come on... There you go. Hi. -Hi. Hi, beautiful. -What do you think?

You're making a mistake, man. I don't think so. [handcuffs locking] Let's go, come on. Move it. He's all yours, sir. It's not him! This is not Rafael DuPont! I've been trying to tell you guys. My name's Colin Burns, I'm a journalist. I've been searching for the Hunter. Look, check my back wallet. I have all my info in there, newspaper clippings with my name on it. My face is on there. See? Colin Burns. Right there, right there, right there. Mmm..I um, I have so much going on right now, I just, I can't, I need to take things so slow, it's... -It's okay. I'll wait as long as you want. Okay. I want you to know something. While I'm around, no one will ever hurt you again. Okay. I'm gonna go get another bottle. [fire crackling] Ahh.. [sinister music] I-I don't understand, Marshal. I mean, it had to be Rafael, it had to be him. He knew my name. He knew my real name. -That's because he's a reporter. The same guy who wrote those articles on the Hunter back in Philly. Now he was able to track you down because your friend called you on a burner phone that you were forbidden to have. The good news is we have no reason to believe that Rafael knows where you are. Okay, well, that's good. -All right, the FBI's plane just landed. They're going to question him and I'll keep you posted. Okay, thank you, Marshal. [exhales] So seriously, guys.. You really aren't going to arrest me. Are you? For following a story? [handcuffs clanking] Well, that's up to you. We have you on a lot right now. Home invasion, assault... But if you were to give us something useful.. Okay, fine. How exactly do you know about this place? See the name of the motel? Ring any bells? Oaktree Inn. It sounds familiar. -Yeah. It's the place where Rafael's mom used to work as a maid. Remember? Yeah. -Yeah. ..where she was murdered when Rafael was a little boy. I remember that. In room, uh, 203. -Yeah, I must've just missed him. The maid was about to clean up, so I, uh, rented out the room for the month so nothing would get disturbed. And you didn't think about showing it to the police? Just went ahead and destroyed all the evidence? Hey, I didn't destroy anything. I kept everything the way it was. I just wanted to have some pictures for my book. Especially of the bloody bandages in the bathroom. Think he was injured during the escape? -Could be. Let's get forensics in here. -Let's check the local clinics and hospitals too. If he was that badly injured, he might have not gotten far. Got anything else, for us? Well, I don't know how much this will help you, but I've been working on a theory. From everything I've seen over the past years, the Hunter needs his victims to fall in love with him before murdering them. Otherwise there's no satisfaction in the kill. [Camille laughing] -What? Next time I'm picking the movie. I know, you should. I mean, how was I supposed to know it was gonna be so violent? [Camille laughing] So, tell me, any news on that crazy ex of yours? -No. I can't imagine what it's like to be consistently looking over your shoulder. -Yeah, it's really hard, but you know what? It's harder for her. Ah. Kids are resilient. You know the good thing that has come out of all of this is that I met someone who I have so much in common with. I gotta tell you, I feel the same way. I mean, I've only known you a few months but it feels like I've known you forever. -Yeah. So, what are you doing on the weekend? Um, that's Valentine's Day. Oh, yeah, it sure is. And let me warn you, I make a mean coq au vin. Seriously? -Yeah. That's my favorite thing. -Oh, come on. It's my favorite. [laughing] Um, it's a date. -I'm glad. You're amazing. I'm sorry sweetie, I said no. Come on. Mom. Mom, it's not fair. You can't just say that I can do something and then change your mind last minute. No, honey, that's life. Things like this happen. You're not going. But they're literally on their way to get me. No, sweetie, I said I had a really bad feeling about this, and I do - do you understand that? Mom, it is going to be completely safe. Her older sister's gonna be there. We're just camping. I said no. You know, this-this whole witness protection thing I think has made you crazy. 'Kay, maybe you're right but you're still not going. Well, I hate you. -Of course you do. Dammit. [phone ringing] -Hello? Hey. -Hey, Emilee. Happy Valentine's Day. Did you get my flowers? I did, I did, thank you so much. They're beautiful. I'm looking at them right now. Great, that's great. So uh, what time you think I should come get you tonight? Yeah, that's why I was calling. Um, I'm not going to be able to make it tonight. Sorry. Well, is everything okay, Emilee? What happened? Nothing happened, really, I just, I don't know. I just told Lillie she couldn't go camping, I have a really bad feeling about tonight. Yeah. If horses can feel vibes maybe people can as well. Although... What do you mean? -I don't know, Emilee, you know, I'm thinking maybe if there really is this lunatic out there, perhaps it's better that Lillie's in the middle of nowhere with all her friends. I'm thinking she'd be safer out there. Maybe it'd be more difficult for him to track her out there, you know? You know what? That is a really good point. I didn't even think about that. You know what? it doesn't matter anyway. Her friends have already left and I can't take her because I can't miss my first PTA meeting. It's okay, I can give her a ride. I'm not doing anything. No. No. No. I would never ask you to do that, it's fine. No, no, it's okay. It's my pleasure. Be there in five minutes, okay? Really? Thank you. Thank you so much. [honking] Okay, bye mom, I love you. I will text you every hour, I promise. Bye. [crickets chirping] Here. Water, it's a long trip. Oh, thank you. Mmm. Are you sure that we're going the right way 'cause it looks like we're in the middle of nowhere. Oh, no, no. It's the right way. You can put on some music if you want. -Sure. [country music] [shuts music off] What's up, you don't like that song? No, I do. It's just it reminds me of someone, but it's over, so... I wouldn't worry too much because if you're meant to be with Mike, you will find each other again. Did I tell you his name was Mike? No, no. Your mother mentioned it to me. [suspenseful music] [tires on gravel] What's going on? Why'd we stop? We got a flat, you didn't feel it? [door shuts] [suspenseful music] Why don't you come out and give me a hand? [suspenseful music] Thank you so much for coming in, I really enjoyed meeting both of you. Thank you. Hi. All done? -Hey, yes, I'm all done. Good, good. Hey, what happened? Well, it looks like a little grease. Oh, yeah, must've happened while I changed the tire on my car. -Oh, is everything okay? Yeah, yep-yep. All good. It's me you gotta worry about now. [laughing] Um, thank you for that. It's no problem at all. And, well, if I must be honest, I did have a secret motive all along. -What? Well... I wanted to have you all to myself tonight. I like that. This is amazing. Where did you learn to make coq au vin? [laughing] Well, I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you. [laughing] Champagne? Yes. I'll be right back. [sinister music] Oh my, god. Wow, that is beautiful. Brian, this is seriously the best Valentine's Day. Well, it's not over yet. Well, the thing is, Emilee, I, uh, I'm very well aware we haven't known each other that long. But you gotta admit the last couple of months have been pretty intense, right? Yeah. -Yeah. Look, I guess what I'm really trying to say is that, um, I've been suppressing my feelings. I've been suppressing the way I really feel toward you because of what you've been going through. And well, I guess I've made a decision not to deny the way I feel about you anymore. [phone ringing] I am so sorry. That could be Lillie, give me one second. Just one second. Sorry. Hello? Agent Halloran? Camille, I'm sorry to call you so late. We've had a development and I wanted to fill you in. We were able to track down the doctor who worked on Rafael. His remains, actually. He died a few months ago in a fire. Does that mean.. did Rafael kill him? -We think so. But this doctor, he's a plastic surgeon. So we're thinking Rafael wasn't actually injured in the escape. We think he may have altered his appearance. He-he changed his appearance so... Listen, I'm not trying to scare you but we don't know what Rafael looks like right now. Now if he did alter his appearance enough, he might be completely unrecognizable. So I might not know who he is if I saw him? -We did find a hotel clerk and he saw Rafael when he was checking out. He's going to do a sketch for us so we'll know what Rafael looks like soon, I promise, and I will email that to you as soon as I have it, okay? [gasping] Okay. And in the meantime, I'm sending the Marshal to your house to pick up you and your daughter. Wait-wait. We're not home right now, I-I need to go and get Lillie. I'm going to go pick her up and then we can meet the Marshal at my house. Okay? Okay. Thank you. [gasping] Are you okay? What happened? I couldn't help but overhearing the stalker changed his identity? I-I need to go get Lillie and I need to go home. I'm sorry. I need to call her. She's not answering. Lillie, Lillie, if you get this, please call me back, I'm coming to get you right now. I feel like I'm gonna be sick. [suspenseful music] [door closing upstairs] [ominous music] -Hey. [gasp] I'm sorry. I just need a minute. -Sure. But it seems you found my deep, dark secret. What do you mean? -That I'm a sentimental fool. It's my granddad's room. Hey, granted he'll never see any of these clothes again, I just can't bring myself to get rid of them. Look how organized this guy was. He was ex-military. I'm gonna miss him. Did that sketch come in? Check your email, maybe-maybe the sketch has come in. -Yeah. Yes. Does he look familiar? -No. The email says that I need to get to a safe place and I need to get rid of my phone. Yeah. That makes sense, Emilee. Okay. Listen, I know of a cabin a couple of hours from here. My friend owns it. If you like, I can take you there. -Okay. Okay. But you have to do everything the FBI tells you to do. -Okay. I need to call Lillie. I... Call from my phone, okay? It's safer. Call on the way. Let me take that. -Okay, we need to call her. Okay. Come on... Come on. Yeah, that was the man. -Okay. Email it to Camille immediately. [suspenseful music] [fire crackling] [fire crackling] [car stopping] Okay. I'll be back in a minute. Violet? Violet? Violet? -Hi, hi. Hi. Is this Ashley's Sweet 16 party? Yeah, it is. I'm Joy, her older sister. Great. I'm here to pick up my daughter, Violet. Violet? -Yeah. There's no one by that name here. Of course there is. she was just dropped off two hours ago. Violet! Mom? Violet! Mom, what are you doing here? -Get your stuff, we gotta go. Come on, get your stuff. -Okay. Okay. Violet? I thought your name was Lillie. Oh it-it's like a nickname. We have to go. Tell Ashley I said bye. Okay? What's going on? The phone, Emilee. Give me your phone. Mom! Go, I'll explain later. Wait, so you're saying that we have no idea what Rafael looks like anymore? No, sweetie, we do. Agent Halloran texted me a picture but I didn't recognize the face. -Well, can I see it? The sketch, I mean, maybe I have seen him around school or in town or something? No, sweetie. I don't have the sketch anymore because I don't have a phone. But I'm telling you, if Rafael was at this school, I would've recognized him, I know it. Babe, we're going someplace safe. Let's just.. let's both try to get some sleep, okay? And I'll just, I'll wake you when we get there. Did you tell Agent Halloran where we're going? No. No. But as soon as I get to the cabin, I will. Hey, it's me. I'm at the house. She's not here. [jarring music] Hang on a sec... Oh, man. I think she's with him. They could be miles from here by now. If she's even still alive. [sinister music] [coughs] You're still up? You're not sleeping? Oh, no, I-I can't. Um, mom, how are you going to call Agent Halloran if you don't have a phone? -Brian has a phone. Oh, uh, cool, c-could I borrow it for a sec? -Yeah, sure, of course. Ugh. It's out of juice. Who were you thinking of calling anyway? Oh, no one. I just, um, I wanted to look at the news and see if maybe they caught Rafael or something. -Hey, maybe there's something on the air. Let's have a look. Oh don't-don't worry about it. [radio news station] Uh, okay, it-it's really okay, forget about it. Mm. Actually though, I am.. I have to pee really badly, could-could we pull over there, please? That's not a bad idea. Hemingway probably has to pee too. -Okay. I'm coming with you just to make sure it's safe. Uh, okay. Come on, Hemingway. Let's go. Gotta pee? You're good. You want me to wait for you? Oh, no, that's-that's totally fine. Thank you. -You sure? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I-I'll be back. -Okay. [door slams shut] [ominous music] What? [slams phone down] [suspenseful music] Hey, mom? How long 'til we're there? I don't know. Don't worry, we're almost there. We're almost there. It won't be long. Hey, mom. Can I just talk to you for a second? -Can you help me with the bag, please, sweetheart? Uh, sure. I just need to talk to- -We really should get you inside to the cabin. I think she's with Hemingway. -Oh. Right this way. You'll be fine. -Where is she? Let's get you to your room. We'll see you later? -Yeah, I'll meet you guys inside, I'm taking him to pee. -This way, right this way. A little bit of a hike just to the front. -Okay. It's pretty, yeah? -Mm-hmm. It's been in my friend's family for years. So, this is your room. What do you think? -It's, uh, it's great. Thanks. Phew. I just have this really bad headache. Are you drinking your water? Because you really should be hydrating. [sinister music] You. You're... -Shh. I have to go talk to my mom. I have to m-mo-... Shh-shh. I really.. need to talk.. to my mom. Shh. [door slams shut] Hey. -Hey. How's Lillie? -She's okay. She's, uh, all settled up in her room. -Oh, good. -Sound asleep already. Can you imagine, no phone, no internet. Why stay awake, yeah? -Yeah. Whew.. Brian, you've been amazing. It seems like you're always coming to my rescue. Yeah. just happy to be some help, actually. And hey, the good news is that no one's going to find you out here. Yeah. [sighs] You know what I would kill for right now? -What's that? A glass of wine. Hmm. Well, it just so happens that I'd kill for one too. I'll be right back. -Okay. [door closing] Here you go. -Ahh. Thank you. Thank you, thank you. -Sure. Cheers. Cheers. [glasses clinking] [sigh] You know, as awful as this whole thing has been, it would've been so much worse without you here. Well, I'm happy to hear that because.... Well, look Emilee, I know I haven't known you too long, it's only been a couple of months, I know that. But I also know that we've gotten pretty close these last couple of months, yeah? Yeah. -Yeah. And look, maybe it's because of what we're going through, I don't know. But, what I do know is I don't want to lose you and that I love you. What are you doing? Emilee Connors... What? Will you marry me? I mean, um, Brian I... of course I-I feel the same way, I do, it's just there's- there's so much going on in my life right now, I don't know if I-I... Of course, of course I love you. But you don't trust me because of him, I understand. No, I do. I will. I-I do. Well, I love you. I love you. I will marry you. Yeah? Yes! [laughs] [laughs] Come here. -I can't believe it. Just give me your hand. -I'm shaking. [laughing] Now we have a reason to celebrate. What did you- did you bring champagne? I did. [giggling] [suspenseful music] Camille, I need you to tell me that you love me. Why don't you just put this on? [ominous music] Hi. Where's the champagne? Champagne? Come on, Camille. Don't you think it's time we stopped pretending? What do you mean? What am I talking about? Hmm. I mean, it's almost like we're meant to meet each other again, don't you think? Oh my god. No. You know what's funny? You knew I was looking for you all along but you fell in love with me again. You changed your name, your identity, you moved around the country and still you fell in love with me. Again. Shh. No! Please don't! please! please! Please! Please don't do this. I've gotta tell you, the last couple of months have been very, very precious to me. You were so suspicious. You were so withdrawn, yet day by day you opened up to me. You did. But still I wasn't sure what you were gonna say when I asked you. But when you said yes... that's a memory that you and will share forever. Actually, it's a shame this has to end.. but most things do. [clanking] Auugh! [fast suspenseful music] Violet! Wake up! Violet, wake up! Baby? Baby? -Camille? [knocking on door] Violet! -Open the door! [banging] Violet! [door crashes open] [door slams shut] [gasping and crying] You are really ruining a wonderful moment. Please... Don't make me do anything you're gonna regret. Do not hurt her! Do not hurt her, I will do anything you want me to, please. Please.. please. [suspenseful music] [spraying] Auuugh! [bangs against the door] [cutting sound] Ugh.. Uhh.. [gasping] [blood dripping to the floor] [thud]
