How'd the drop go? It was good. I fuck your mothers. Oh, you just made my day. Why did you do that? Well, you saw him. He was coming at me! What was I supposed to do? People just don't respect mothers anymore, do they, Vlad? Shit! What the... I don't wanna hear it. Pick up this Russki asshole and throw him in the back of the truck. Fuck is this? This doesn't have to get messy. We're both reasonable people. It doesn't have to go this way. But we can take it that way if you want. I am a cold-blooded, heartless machine of a man... You don't buy it, do you? It's okay. I don't think I do either. Come on, Brooke. Here we go, here we go. Here we go, here we go. Oh. Hey, Barry. Thanks for calling me back. How are you doin'? Oh, yeah. I... I do hear that. No, I-I hear that. I heard that, uh, they were bringing both shifts back on at the end of the month. - Hi. - Yeah. Hi. Well, you know, you can pay me whatever you can now, and then, when you get paid in a month or two, pay the balance. Well, I do know where you live. Yeah, take care, man. If you mess with my system, Robert Mitchell... Jaansen Supply needs to go on the top. There is no top. Okay, these are outstanding payments and these are just deadbeats who can't or won't. Barry got laid off again. Barry drives a $70,000 truck. Yeah. Robert, you are a good guy, but you can't keep running around, like some sort of septic-tank Robin Hood. Okay, we have a baby now, hon', and... What do you want me to do? Am I supposed to let these people swim around in their own... Yeah, well, maybe if you did, they'd dig a little deeper. People are struggling. So are we. Babe, the mill called, and they want me to put in some part-time hours here at home. I guess the accountant in the city just isn't cutting it. We talked about this. You said you wanted to take care of Brooke for the first couple of years while I worked and I fed the family. We need the income, babe. Especially since you won't collect from the people for the work that you do. Robert, it's something coming in. Can we discuss this later? I'm doing a re-pipe up at Tim Witner's House. At least we know he's good for it. No, we need to talk about this now. Look, I can't handle this now. Bobby, please? No! Let's... Let's discuss this later. Well, that could have gone better. Oh, come on, baby. Come on, come on, come on, come on. Ah. Good girl. She's right. Septic Robin Hood. Morning, Brett. Just give me $10 of regular, - and don't go over, please. - You got it. Fill her up, Brett. Hey, Bobby! How's it going? Eh, I can't complain, Jo. Who'd listen? Get this. They got us going 45 minutes out of town to investigate a bunch of missing trees. Jordan? Yeah? Get me a cup of coffee. Okay, boss. Hey, Bob. How's life? Oh, baby's good. Carrie's not too happy with me at the moment. I've been extending credit to everybody, and... Here we go. ...acting like a bank. Thanks. We can't afford to do that. Well, you're a good guy, Robert. But do the good guys ever win? I'd like to think so. You know those movies with John Wayne, when the good guys come out on top? "Well, keep it up, partner." Thanks, pilgrim. Y'all be careful out there. Are you doing your John Wayne impression again? Get in the car. Oh, no, no, no, no. Come on, baby. Come on, come on. We can do this. We can do this. We got this. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Okay, come on, come on. Great. This is Carrie, leave a message. Carrie, listen, about this morning, I'm... Can we try to be cool this time? Yeah, yeah, yeah. How are you doing, Timmy Witner? What is this? This, is where we ask you to get into the truck. We need to talk to you. If a tree falls in the forest, does anyone hear about it? The federal government heard it. I'm Sheriff Higgon and this is my deputy, Jordan Pacer. Hey. Pleasure. Helen Masur, FBI financial for... Yeah, special agent. Portland. We do get emails out here, you know? Sheriff, she's just here to help us with our missing tree. Hey Jimmy, get the tape. Gotta set up a perimeter. Two trillion dollars a year. I'm sorry, what's that now? That's the money side of this thing. Timber, fishing, and wildlife... Poaching is big business. That's a hell of a lot of money. Well, they ain't exactly setting up shop on Main Street. Hard to find these folks out here. It's more a matter of following the money rather than the people. You don't think these guys are following the rules, do you? Doing things the right way, so they can all afford to compete? Not a chance. And, as you know, this is old growth. Protected land. Well, glad to have you here. We could use the help. Two trillion dollars, Sheriff. That's organized crime. That's guns and drugs and murder. And they're certainly not paying taxes, which, last I checked, is your paycheck and mine. Sheriff, you'd better come check this out. Where is it now? Main line, main line... Okay. Here we go. There you are. Damn it. Guess I have to fix that now. What do you idiots want? Get him up. Where is it? I'm not fuckin' around here, Tim. Where is what? Hmm. The money. We know about the bags, and the trucks, and the outlaw tree cutting you've been doing. We know you've got money somewhere. Now is the part where you tell me where it is. I don't know what you're talking about. Goddamn it. This guy still doesn't think that we're serious. Why don't you go out to the truck? Bessie? And get me Bessie. We know everything about you, Tim. We've been watching you. We got the pills. We've been through your house... Your office... You didn't know that, did you, Tim? We're professionals, Tim. We know you've got cash here somewhere... so... You're the professionals? God help us. If you leave right now, I'll pretend like I don't remember your stupid fucking face. Where... is the fucking... money? Fuck! Cocksucker! Fucking one-eyed Willie. Son of a bitch. Fucking... You like watching TV, Tim? Hmm? Catch a ball game? Maybe watch the fights? 'Cause you got about ten seconds before I turn you into a radio, man. You're gonna tell me where the money is. And you're going to tell me right fucking now. Got her! Damn it! If you keep killing everyone before they tell us where the money is, how are we ever gonna find it? I know! We... I know! We were supposed... I know what we were supposed to do! How are we gonna find the money now? Cover him up. Tired of looking at his stupid face. Don't worry about it. What the... I know where the money is. Shh. Shh. Shh. There's gotta be a hatch door or something. This house is basically on fucking stilts. Get him! Oh! I got him! I got him! Dooley, pull him out! Move, move, move, move! Dooley! You stupid son of a bitch! Fuck that. Fuck! Fuck. Look at this. Come look at this. Huh. Looks like they screwed up. Got too close to the edge. Most of the time, when these poachers pull one or two trees, they chop it into pieces and pull them out in a pickup, but this is a full-sized hauler. This operation has some money behind it. Yeah. I see that. Hmm. Listen, you don't have to escort me. I can find my way around town. What do you got? Two traffic lights? I'm not gonna get lost. Nah. I'd love to show you around. I love being a cop. When I was kid, I used to write fake tickets for my friends when they'd leave their bikes on their lawn. If there's something illegal going on in my town, I'd really like to know. I mean, you're a fed, and I'm a cop, but, like, I feel like we're on the same team. You're on the phone. That's fine, yup. Some news about our friend in the forest. His name's Vladimir Popov, 38 years old, two counts of possession of a controlled substance, three counts of assault with a deadly weapon, and the laundry list goes on. Vlad wasn't a local, was he? Dead guy? No. I've never seen him before. Hmm. What's the closest lumber mill to here? Tim Witner's? Tim Witner. I need to make a call. Okay. Oh, it's bad! Man, my hand. I gotta go to the hospital. You ain't going to the hospital. I-I... Put it out of your head. We're here, and we're gonna be here for the duration. You hear that, friend? We got nowhere to be until this is over. Who the fuck are you? I'm nobody, man. I'm just the plumber. Well, bad luck for you, then, plumber. You got something down there that belongs to us, don't you? I don't know what you're talking about, man. Why don't you just give it to us, and we'll let you go. Really? Truth is, man, you're not worth the effort. You give us our money, and we got no reason to stick around. How can I trust you? Let me run down the situation for you, friend. We're in a house in the middle of nowhere. We got nothing but time. You're the one that's stuck. You must be bleeding. So you tell me how long you think you've got. Why don't we get you out of there? Get you some help. As far as I'm concerned... we can just sit here, have a drink, wait for you to die, and then kick open the goddamn hatch and take our money. Sterling, I can't just keep sitting here. Listen to me. We don't know who that is down there, but he's alone, he's hurt, and he's scared. He ain't gonna make it that long. Okay? Drink up. Let me see it. Look at me. Look at me. Let me see it. Open it. This is gonna hurt like a motherfucker. I am sorry. Sorry? Timber poaching? Tim Witner? I made a call to Washington on my way to your station. There is a pattern of financial discrepancies. So you thought he'd just run an illegal timber operation in my town? And what, I wouldn't know it? Hell, come on, lady. We know every damn person in this town. Through and through. Before you start accusing and slandering people, I wanna get some hard evidence. Look, Tim is a pillar of this community, running a successful business, and I don't want you to ruin his or anybody else's life on your hunches. It's not that shocking. Look at the opioid problem you've got here. It's all linked. The money. The trees moving. The drugs. Eh, makes sense. Sorry, boss. So I'm checking in before I dig deeper and make a call up the food chain. In the spirit of co-operation. Look. I understand that we're coming at this from slightly different angles... Yeah, different angles, but yours being the high and mighty one here. I wanna see Witner's operation. I need to talk to people and have a look around. Fine, go ahead. Watch 'em saw logs, for crying out loud. You ask me, I think what you're looking for is in this computer. We see the bad numbers, then we make a case from that. What he puts out there for us is not necessarily what's going on behind closed doors. You get me? Financial discrepancies. She's right. She's got a point. I suppose she does. All right. Well, let's look into these financial discrepancies, shall we? Fine, but stay in touch. Oh, and Trisha's making tuna casserole tonight and you know how she gets when you're late. You got it, boss. Hmm. Come on. He always like that? Wade? That's just small-town shit. He really cares about this place. Wait. Come on. Has he got a connection to Witner? Yeah, sure. We all do. Tim's kinda like the unofficial mayor of this place, so it's a bit tough watching you try to take him down, when he's the person who's been keeping the town afloat. I am not trying to take him down. I know, the numbers. It's not personal, but around here, everybody knows everybody, so, it does feel kind of personal. Well, then I guess it's time for me to get to know some people. Okay. Okay... Okay. No, no, no, no, no, no. Hey, Jeff. Afternoon. I'm Agent Masur with the FBI. Need to ask you a few things. Yeah? Okay. What's up? Heard about anything interesting happening in town lately? Interesting? Here? Anyone making bank? Any extra drinks flying around the bar? Any of your pals got new trucks? No. Hell no. Just Tim. Tim? Tim Witner? The owner? If you know something, Jeff, you just need to tell this nice lady. I just move product. Bring it in raw, cut to order and deliver. Clock-in, clock-out, go home. Sorry I couldn't be of any help. Okay. Well... Touched a nerve there. Seems so. Let's see what other feathers we can ruffle. Excellent plan. Carrie! Hey, Mama. Hey, Jordy! Let me see that baby. Oh, she's an angel! Oh, this is Helen Masur. She's from the FBI. Hi. Uh, Carrie Mitchell. Do you work for Mr. Witner? Yeah, I do. I've just... I've been on maternity leave the last five weeks. I'm just picking up some part-time work from home now. Gotta make ends meet. Right? It's tough, though. I just wanna spend as much time with this little monkey as I can. Do you have some time to talk here, just for a little bit? Is something wrong? Oh, just want to ask you one or two questions. It's okay, Carrie. We're just looking into some... financial discrepancies, I believe, is the term. Uh, yeah. I mean, I am the bookkeeper, but I haven't been around in a few weeks, so I don't know if there's anything I could do for you, or if I'm even the right person to talk to. Oh, I think you're exactly the right person. Okay. Hey, Ster, you wanna help me get Bess loaded? My hand... Forget about that medieval bullshit. It takes ten minutes to load. How you doing, plumber? You still alive? Breathing? I'm hanging in, man. How about you? You know, I just got back into town. I was away for a while. A little vacation, if you will. Fourteen years in the cooler. Fourteen fucking years. I learned something on the inside. A man's life can be bought and sold. How much, plumber? Don't ignore me. You don't need to make that mistake. Yeah, well... it wouldn't be the first. Let me tell you something about mistakes, amigo. We ain't friends. We could be. I want you to think about all the mistakes that you've made. Think about what you'd do with a second chance. I bet you've got a wife and kid you wanna see. This shit is simple from where I stand. You got something down there I want. I'm selling you a happy tomorrow, plumber. I'm selling you a chance to fix all those mistakes. A chance to live the rest of your fucking life. You interested? Look, man. You killed Tim. You shot me with a crossbow! I can't trust you. I get that. We got off on the wrong foot. See, my partner and I, we're in a stressful situation, but we don't got nothing against you. I cut him up pretty good. Yeah, well, bygones. What do you need to feel comfortable? Leave! What's that? Walk away. Once you're gone, I'll leave the bag and I'll go. You come back in an hour, take the money. It's that easy. You really think that'll work? You asked. I mean, I guess we're just gonna have to take this... That hit you, plumber? Come on, man. Speak up. Kill that shit. You counting my shots down there, plumber? Hmm? You think I'd bust my nut and then I'm gonna go home? Don't you worry, baby, because I can go all night long. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry, baby. You're right, I shouldn't have been so soft on everybody. You're always right. You and the baby... you're all that matters. You say something, plumber? I didn't catch that. Okay. This place has been here for 70 years. Really? Yeah. Let me know if you need to talk to these people. These are the main accounts. I don't see anything wrong with the numbers, do you? - These are your numbers? - Yeah. Up until about six weeks ago. I mean, do you really think Tim is up to something shady? I think he's in a tough business. I think there's a lot of regulations, and when the numbers don't add up... It might lead to taking shortcuts. I can assure you, Ms. Masur, that my numbers are clean. Is that your intimidating look? What's this? Fuel. That look right to you? Hell if I know. It does look high, though. Can you get us backups of these? I'd like to have my forensic accountants take a look. Uh... What? Look, you asked me in here because you wanted to ask me a couple of questions, maybe look at some numbers, and I'm fine with that, but whatever this is... Look, I've known Tim my entire life, and he might... Look, Tim is not doing anything shady, okay? He's not a thief. And I don't feel comfortable having the two of you in here, in the system, without talking to Tim first. Okay, so if you guys could leave, I need to feed my baby. Thank you, Jordan. He might what? You said you've known Tim your entire life and he might... Nothing. What might he do? Nothing. I didn't mean anything by that. I'm sorry, Carrie. Mrs. Mitchell, you seem like a genuinely good person. I appreciate you helping us out. Hi. Hi, you. I still think she knows more than she's letting on. I think she's a pretty honest lady. I don't think she'd hold anything back from you. I don't think she would tell us anything she doesn't think her boss wants us to know. I don't think that's who she is. Who's that? That's Gerald Simmons. He's a good kid. He just does lots of dumb stuff. Hey, Gerald. Hey, Jo. I'm Special Agent Masur, FBI. How you doing today? Hey! Shit. Gerald, wait! Oh! Gerald! What are you doing? Stop right there! Stop! Just stop for a second! Stop! I just want to talk to you. Shortcut. What is your father going to say about this, Gerald? - Jordy, I didn't do anything. - Why did you run? Ah. Look what we have here. Shit. Ooh, how many is that? Two? Six? 12? That's intent to distribute, Gerald. Okay, where'd you get them? Jesus. Where'd you get the pills? Hey, Duane! How are you? Aw, shit, please don't do that. I got your boy here. Yeah. I hear that. I hate to be the one with more bad news, but I'm afraid it's about Gerald. The Russian. Name. His name is Vlad. It's Vlad. Yeah, Duane, I had to chase him down. Yeah. He's real fast. Yeah, the usual. We'll check him in and you just come to the station. Okay, bye. Pitiful. I can't find him. I'm gonna keep his ass occupied. You are gonna go back out there and find a fucking way in. But, um... He is one man and he is shot. Look at you. You're a specimen. You are a bad man. That little prick doesn't stand a chance against you. But he's got a knife. There. You're even. Last chance, plumber. We can still make us a deal! Fuck! Fuck. Oh, shit. Fuck. If you fire that goddamn gun one more time, you'll be sorry. I warned you. I am going to kill you. I'm gonna fucking kill you. Hey, asshole, over here. What the fuck? Jesus Christ! That's our money! Put it out! Fuck it! Put it out! Ah! Sterling! Sterling! Sterling! Sterling! Jesus Christ... Damn it! Put it out! Put it out! Oh, God! Oh, God! Put it out! Put it out! Oh, shit! No. Oh, no. Tim... Hey, Carrie. Hey, Jordan, I was just... Checking in, yeah. Anything on your side? Yeah. I'm taking another look at the books at the lumber mill, and there's a bunch of secondary accounts set up in the last few months, and I think I found something. Seriously? Who is it? It's Carrie. It looks really bad. Like, cooked-up fed BLM timber contracts, and also some odd health care disability payouts. I mean, and then it all gets siphoned through the mill account. It's a lot of money, Jordan. I mean, it's the most money I've ever seen, and then it's gone, like, a week later. Okay, we'll come to you. No, everything's gonna be fine. You just sit tight, and I'll come get you, and we'll go through everything with Sheriff Wade and Agent Masur, okay? Okay. I'll see you soon. You've reached Mitchell Plumbing. Please leave a message... So Carrie's kind of freaked out, so why don't you take Mr. Pill Popper inside and I'll be right back. Son of a bitch. I am going to fucking end you. Oh, yeah, I know. You're going to kill me, huh? Whatever I do, you're gonna kill me, if you can. You'd best believe that I can. Well, here's the deal... You're... You're making deals now? Fuck you, plumber! You're not getting the money. That's it. If you make a move, you'd better make it work fast, because I can promise you, with my dying breath, I will make sure that you get nothing. Bullshit. The deal is this... If you walk away, like I said before. In a couple of hours, you come back, I'll leave you some of this money. Some? Some of it? That's as good as it gets. Who in the fuck do you think you are? I am a cold-blooded, heartless machine of a man, and there's no world where you walk away from this. So that's it? Hmm? That's the deal on the table? That's the deal. I don't think you understand who you're dealing with. I'm a plumber. I deal with pieces of shit all day long. Ha! Fuck you! Twenty grand. I hope it was worth it. I got him! Hold him there! What? Move! Motherfucker! Ah! Bastards! I'm out of fucking bullets. Who you texting? You know. Oh, shit. Yeah. We could use a little bit of help. I can't believe Tim is in on this. Where's Robert? He's up at Tim's. I mean, do you think he's in danger? No, but I've got to get up there and bring Tim in for questioning. Okay. I'm going to Tim's with you. Goddamn. You good? I'll live. Guy's no pussy. He's dug in there real good. Hey. Look! Here. Now we're talking. Aha! Here. A few more. All right, come here. Let's make a plan and end this cocksucker. I knew you were stupid the day I took you to the ER. About a mile away, the Petersons have a giant German shepherd. And shithead here, walked by a fence and shot BB's at him. But I told him, "One day that dog's gonna get you back." And sure enough, he did! That dog hopped that fence, chased him down, and ripped him around like a rag doll. I knew then you were stupid. You know we found your friend, Vlad, this morning. Dead. Boy, you're in some deep trouble here. Now, if you know something, you'd better speak up. How long you been working for Vlad? I think we can pin you for the distribution of narcotics. That's minimum five years. Are you poaching, Gerald? Huh? I only did a couple... Where were you early this morning? I was at my cousin's house. Did you kill Vlad? No, he couldn't have killed Vlad. Or did you, Gerald? Did you? Look, there's... There's a couple of guys who do this. We go out around 4:00 a.m. It's a skeleton crew, no machines, just chain saws. We take down a couple of old-growth trees, drop them off at Tim's mill, we get a bag of oxies. That's it. Wait for a phone call to do it again. Stupid. All set, then, to do it? All set. Any second now. Any second. Fuck. Sterling, won't it burn the money? Maybe some of it. You got a better fucking idea? Holy shit! Yes! Huh? I bet that did it! He must be dead. Yeah. Well, you're about to find out. No, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey. No loose fucking ends. Right? Right? You got it? You got it? Yes! Now get in there. Bring me that fucking money. This is just... this is just insane. You know, the worst part is, is that it was happening right underneath my nose and... You know I had nothing to do with this, right, Jordy? I know you had nothing to do with it, Carrie. We'll figure this out. Okay. Plumber? Hey! Come on, give up! There's nowhere to hide! You're done, man! Plumber! You've got our money. Plumber! Where are you? Plumber! Yoo-hoo. I got him! I got him, Sterling! I got him! Yes! You're gonna die, plumber! Where's my gun? Are you dead? D-Dooley? D-Dooley! Dooley! Fucking Dooley! You're not dead. I'm fucking coming for you! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fucking... Okay, okay. Stay down. I'll let you know when it's safe! Okay. Sheriff's department! Keep 'em where I can see 'em. Oh, shit... Well, that took longer than expected. Yeah. I got your text. You killed Tim! What the hell is going on? You are such an idiot! This was not the plan. I don't give a shit about the plan. Okay, this was supposed to be a real simple rip and run. All due respect, you don't know what the fuck you're talkin' about. What? Jordan, this is Wade. Copy? Wade? I think you'd better get down here. I think something is going on. Tim's place. Stay put. I'm on my way. You idiots. I had this all planned out. Jesus Christ, you two are soft. He's just a plumber. Keep talking. That plumber is goddamn ex-military, or a fucking Navy SEAL, or some shit. Okay, he wasn't even on the varsity football team, okay? I know Bob Mitchell. And where the fuck is Dooley? He went in there with that plumber. He ain't coming out. This is ridiculous. He's just a goddamn plumber. I got this. Come on. What? I can't believe I fucked you! Sorry, Carrie. Nothing personal. Jordan, what's going on? There's a lot of money at stake. Jordan, what are you doing? Ow, ow. You're hurting me! Meet the plumber's wife. Who are you? No. No. I'm a friend of your husband's. So now that Dooley's gone, you figure, what, a 50-50 split? Half? You get half burned? Half shot at? Half drilled on? I am the one with all the blood on my hands. I set this up. I knew I shouldn't have brought you in on this. You've been a loser since the day I met you. Everything you touch turns to shit. Bobby! Hey, Bobby! I got your wife! You had one job. I don't know why I thought you could pull it off. You limp-dicked pussy. You should suck my dick for 10%. Fuck... That's a gunshot. Pull over. Yeah. All units, gunshots at Tim's place. 10-71. 10-71. Copy that. All units, 10-18, 10-20... You shot me with my own fucking gun. Fucking piece of shit. See, now that makes the math a lot easier. Tut-tut-tut-tut. Mm-mmm, mm-mmm. Bobby! Come on out, plumber! It's all over. Hmm? Where are ya, boy? Bobby! Come on out, plumber! It's all over! Hey, asshole? Bobby... Look at you. You have made some bad decisions, plumber. All you had to do was die. That's it. Carrie. Bobby. Oh. What do you think he's gonna do with that? Who's the guy with the blowtorch? Robert. What's he doing? I soaked this in paint thinner. If you hurt her, or anything happens to me, I drop this, and all your money goes up. You really wanna do that, plumber? You really wanna watch her die? You see a clear shot? It's kinda funny, because you did all of this, and you're still just a fucking plumber. Yeah. And you're still just a piece of shit. I'm a piece of shit? How's about we stop fucking around and you give me my fucking money? Go on. Do it. Bobby! Are you okay? Thank you. Carrie. I'm sorry about this morning. I should have never left like that. Oh, it's okay. It's okay. I just didn't know if I'd ever have a chance to tell you. You and the baby mean everything to me. I love you. I love you. I'll get you home. Okay. I just spoke with Carrie. If only you had stuck to writing tickets for little kids on bikes, you might have made a decent cop. Go fuck yourself, Helen. Damn shame. Hey, you did all this? Who the hell are you? I'm just the plumber. This doesn't have to get messy. I am a cold-blooded, heartless machine of a man. You still don't buy it, do you? Oh, that's okay. I don't think I do either. There she is, there she is. Oh, oh, oh. I got a phone call. Oh, hey, Barry. Yeah. Thanks for calling me back. How you doing, man? Barry's calling. He wants to come over now with the money. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Sure, Barry. Thanks. Hey, Barry. How's it going? Yeah. I know, I know. I know it's crazy, what happened at Tim's. No, no, it's okay. It's okay. No, you just pay whenever you can, okay? Ow. Okay. "Here's to the good guys." Carrie! Bobby? You're not gonna believe this. What is it? Holy fuck!
