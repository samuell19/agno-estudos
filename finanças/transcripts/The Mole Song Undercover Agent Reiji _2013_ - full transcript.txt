What's with the look, punk? TODOROKI The Chairman TODOROKI The Chairman What do yakuza need? What do yakuza need? They need to be funny HIURA The Mediator HIURA The Mediator Yakuza or not, the rich win. Yakuza or not, the rich win. You have to play the game. TSUKIHARA The Observer TSUKIHARA The Observer You lit the fire, Reiji. You lit the fire, Reiji. Go smoke them out. AKO The Father REIJI KIKUKAWA The Son REIJI KIKUKAWA The Son Until a few months ago, I was a cop in a police box. Until a few months ago, I was a cop in a police box. The decision's final. You're fired, Reiji. But, sir... I have a question. "Why?" The real question is... "Why weren't you fired earlier?" Huh? You graduated with the lowest score in police academy history. You worked in a police box for five years. You annoyed the residents, created countless scandals... and you hold the record for official complaints. Pervert! Then, yesterday... you pointed a gun at an innocent bystander! Innocent bystander? He takes advantage of young shoplifters. He's a dirty piece of slime! Show me everything! Or I'll call the police. Shoplifting may be a crime, but people who prey on the weak are rotten to the core. Don't get me wrong, I'm a pervert, too. But I'm not a twisted pervert! If I catch you again, I'll shoot you for First Degree Decay of the Soul! Reiji, the man you tried to lecture with your weapon... He's Mr. Yoshioka, the City Councillor. - "City Councillor"? - That's right! I went to the Chief of Police and told him to sack you. That was gross misconduct, you halfwit asswipe cop! So, you're fired. - I humbly decline. - It's an order! Sir, this is wrong. We're police. I'm your superior. I order, you obey If I say a crew's pink, it's pink! Right?! All crows are black, sir! - What? - Black is black, right is right... and wrong is wrong! A cop with morals? Totally inappropriate. He's no innocent bystander, he's a criminal! Can't you tell the difference?! Congratulations! - Huh?! - You passed. Passed what? I'm back? Of course not. You're fired. Gross misconduct. Why?! Because you are remarkably inept as a policeman. And you're exactly what I've been looking for. Congratulations! Ouch! What the hell was that?! Reiji Kikukawa, I hereby order you to become an undercover agent. Undercover? How slow are you? You're going to infiltrate a crime ring, and attack them from the inside. But I'm fired. "To deceive foes, first deceive friends". We'll tell everyone you've been dismissed for misconduct. So... you can't have this! Or this, or this! Reiji Kikukawa! Fresh air doesn't suit you. But you will shine underground! You're like a mole! So, where exactly am I going? - (mumbles). - Huh? The Sukiya-kai. Murder, drugs... and human trafficking. The nastiest syndicate in Kanto? No... It's the most nefarious criminal organisation in the country! But what happens if... I'm exposed? Something like this? Hey! Stop it! That... tickles... There it goes! Farewell! Don't think about it. What? And we need to keep this our little secret. It's a top secret mission. Top secret? For a drug-free Japan. You'll infiltrate Sukiya-kai, and arrest the fourth generation boss, Shuho Todoroki! Shuho Todoroki? That is your mission! This is Shuho Todoroki. What was the other one? So, to obtain conclusive evidence against Todoroki... Wait a second! Let me see. Thank you, sir. "I'll teach you everything if you play nice." Give it back. "Gentlemen's Club Moccorina... Kazumi"? Who's this? Your private instructor. Special Agent Kazumi will teach you... all the "ins and outs“ of undercover work. Yes, ma'am Meowww! Oh, my... Instructor Kazumi! Ready for some lessons, huh? What's up, rookie? Hup! I must confess... This is my first time in such a place. What? Don't tell me... You're a brothel virgin? I'm sorry! I mean... You see, Ma'am... Before we start, may I... Fall in love? Idiot! Listen up! This is training! But, Ma'am... Please listen! I made a vow that my first time would be... with someone I truly love. You've never been with a pro, or an amateur? Forgive me, Ma'am! Okay "Lesson one: Go take a shower." Yes, Instructor! What's going on? I should've gotten fired a long time ago. If I could train like this every day... Instructor! So that's how this all started?! Are you police? Cop, Fight? Sukiya-kai! You're an undercover punk! This is all a mistake! Can I take the freeway? Of course not! Reiji? Junna... He got fired? Oui. But... Reiji... Why was he buck-naked? You win... I'm a dirty police dog. Ah, he spilled his guts. If I really was a yakuza, you'd be dead. You're not a yakuza? I'm Kazumi, your private instructor. Kazumi Akagiri, Police Department. Pleasure to meet you. Moccorina... Kazumi? A shower will wake you up. Wait! Wait! Wait! Ouch! This hurts! Feel refreshed? - Kill me. - What? Just kill me. I'll curse you to death in hell! I'll never forget your face! Kazumi Akagiri! "I'm gonna fry you for Aggravated Insult!" You passed. Passed what? I've had more than 20 trainees. They all begged for mercy But you accepted your fate. Did I just accept my fate? Maybe you can bring Todoroki down. Don't be scared. Stay firm, and you will prevail! Yes, sir! Kurohinoki-gumi Kuro...? ...Gumi? Kurohinoki-gumi. They're Sukiya-kai. Hinoki? Sukiya-kai? You start now. Be a good mole, Reiji. What the hell?! Hey well, um... What the hell are you doing? Why are you buck-naked?! You rammed my car 'cause you want to work for me? Impressive. You treat girls the same way? You just rape 'em? Answer him truthfully or I'll castrate you! Shut up! Who asked you'? Name? Reiji Kikukawa! Crap! I used my real name! You want to work for me? Yes, sir! I pledge my life to you! Okay. To brighten things up, shoot him. Huh? Here! Rumour has it this guy's a police dog. Right, Hidaka? Boss... I don't understand. Search him! Hidakaaa! Hidaka...? I'm Hidaka. Nice to meet you. I'm Kikukawa. I'm going to be a dad soon. My girl's pregnant. So... I want my baby to grow up in a safe and happy world. That's my dream. Is he... a mole, too? If you kill him, I'll take you on. Serve five to six years, and you're in. - Save me. - But... if you don't, I'll have to kill you. Don't kill me. I have a young child... You have no choice! He's going to die either way If I kill him, I'll go to prison for murder. If I don't, they'll kill me and I'll go to hell. What should I do? For a drug-free Japan. You'll infiltrate the Sukiya-kai, and arrest the fourth generation boss, Shuho Todoroki! I can't do it! Don't move! Wanna try me? I'll blow his brains out! Hidaka! Let's run! - You're saving me? - Of course! Get yourself together, and stand up! You passed. Huh? You passed! Well done! How many times do I have to pass to actually pass?! The Chief approved, so this is it. What Chief? This is Doppo Fukuzumi, Chief of the Drug Enforcement Agency. My mouth's bleeding, but it's smiling, too. I'm quite overcome with hope and joy You passed the final test. Stop it. Cut it out! I don't want your damn applause! Okay! But... What about him? HUH?! This bottle's made of candy like on TV. It was full of fake blood. Fake blood? They were blanks, but if you shot me, you would've failed. He who kills a cop may save his life once, but treachery will soon be avenged. What's with all the preaching? I was really worried about you! A glass eye? Undercover work isn't easy. If you're exposed, they'll torture you. Put this on. It's a present from our department. "A Bad Boy Suit from the DEA". Policemen are prohibited from participating in undercover operations. DEA agents can go undercover, but there's a catch. We can only go for drugs. Japan is behind. Undercover work is legal for all kinds of crime in the USA. But now, here we have a man, backed by both the DEA and the Police, yet he's affiliated with neither. Indeed, he's the ultimate non-existent undercover agent. Reiji! You are a Super-Elite Mole! I am? One, two, three, start! Mo-Mo-Mole! Mo-Mo-Mole! Let us tell you the “Rules of a Mole“. THE MOLE SONG - Undercover Agent REIJI - Let us tell you the "Rules of a Mole". THE MOLE SONG - Undercover Agent REIJI - THE MOLE SONG - Undercover Agent REIJI - - Okay! Okay! Okay! THE MOLE SONG - Undercover Agent REIJI - THE MOLE SONG - Undercover Agent REIJI - - Let's all recite the “Rules of a Mole". Let's all recite the “Rules of a Mole". Okay! Okay! Okay! Rule One! Never reveal your true identity, even under torture! Okay! Rule Two! Always beware of female pheromones! Okay! Rule Three! The sweetest-sounding words are always traps! Okay! Rule Four! If you keep your resolve, nothing is scary! Okay! The Sukiya-kai are the Wholesalers of Evil! Shuho Todoroki is at the top! Bust him, go deep! Go deep, bust him! Mole! Mole! This is the Mole Song! There's no second verse! Okay! So that's how I ended up... going lo an illegal casino. lt's run by the Akogi-gumi, an arm of the Sukiya-kai. Tiger Jaguar! Ready? Tiger Jaguar! Tiger! Jaguar! Enjoy yourself. Whoa! Keep it cool, Reiji. You're here to seek out the yakuza. Pick a fight, then impress them with your machismo. Just prove you're yakuza material. Cheating at our casino? You have some nerve! Chop off a finger to atone, punk! A finger? You want to see atonement? This is how it's done! I underestimated you. Huh? Uh-oh... You tried to pull a fast one? That ain't fake blood. Brought your own knife? Who do you think you are'? - I said, I didn't cheat! - Hold him. I've always wanted to take a crack... at human balls. Balls? Will they fly? Or just get crushed? He'll probably die of shock. Testes shot. Sounds fun. This is your last chance. You... cheated... didn't you? Didn't you'? Rule four! If you keep your resolve, then nothing is scary! Swing away! You little shit! - Ouch! Owowowww! - Die! Let me introduce... my rock-hard head! You wanted to see atonement? This is how it's done! "I underestimated you," right? Hey! Get up! We're not done! Let me into the Sukiya-kai! - Hey! - Hebishima. Hem, get up. You failed arithmetic, but I gave you a casino. I trusted you to be strong, but look now. You let an amateur whip your ass. Wow, that's funny! Boss? Your nose is so crooked, what would happen if I turned your nose upside down? Humour me. Urn... I guess... What? Well... I wouldn't like it! You're not funny. If your nose was turned upside down... Everyone knows, you'd stick flowers in your nose. What? Then you'd attract some lovely butterflies. Like a double-bud vase?! What do yakuza need? They need to be funny What's with this guy? So... Tell me a funny story... Mr. Phony. Are you a police dog? What's going on? He won't answer the phone. He's even ignoring my sexy photos! Junna, I asked the manager. Kikukawa packed up and left. He said he'd found his calling. His calling? Tell me, who's this on your cell? Junna?! “If you don't respond soon, I won't pop your cherry!“ How cute! Who are you'? All I know at the moment is... you're a virgin. Can't hear me, Leopard Boy? I can hear you... Butterfly Boy That's not funny Rule One! Never reveal your identity, even under torture! I've had enough. Time to die. Shoot him. Go ahead. Am I going to die? Shoot him. I really wanted... I really wanted to have sex. Junna... No way! This can't be the end of me! Nope... I ain't giving up yet! No! Go away! Please, stop it! Shoot me. Shoot! Bang! Bang! Boring bitch! The only thing you'd hear crying at my funeral would be crows. You're just as boring a bitch as she is. To be honest... I'm a hell of a lot funnier than you are! You gonna make me laugh? I'm gonna show you a butterfly... A butterfly you've never seen before! What? A butterfly I've never seen? What kind? This kind! It's a butterfly? I'll pull out all the butterflies in my stomach... and tie them in a butterfly knot! What?! Butterfly knot butterflies? Butterﬂies ﬂutter in the field... Butterﬂies ﬂutter... It's a "Gutterfly". Gutterﬂy.. Gutterffff.. Far out this hurts! You're funny... You're a caterpillar! I know it! And you're ripe. You'll turn into a swanky butterfly! I'm more of a mole person... I'm impressed, Brother. Brother? Let's exchange vows. We shall become Brothers, bound by a bond thicker than blood. All right. Masaya Hiura, a.k.a. “Crazy Papillon“. He's Akogi-gumi, of the Sukiya~kai. He's their number two. Now I'm really... a mole! How are the wounds? Better We're celebrating my return to health tonight. Where? Kabuki-cho. A club called 'True Love'. Hmm? Sounds expensive. The Sukiya-kai's source of revenue. It's a synthetic narcotic: MDMA. It's a "casual" stimulant. It retails for 5,000 yen a pop. They make billions each year. Try counting how many pills out there, pal. Why haven't we busted 'em? It's sold on the net as a 'diet pill' for kids. We can catch the small fry, but we can“! trace it back to the yakuza. I know it's them. The big boss of the Sukiya-kai uses it himself. You'll have to reach the heart of the organisation to get him. You are the only one, Reiji. We're counting on you. What's up, Brother? Nothing. Excuse me, gentlemen. Let me introduce Yuri and Yura. - Welcome. - Junna! They just started today. Welcome. “Welcome," my ass! Why the hell are you here? Straight back at you! Why'd you ignore my sexy shots? Why come to a place like this? How'd you know I was here? A girl named Kazumi mailed me. Kazumi? Kabuki-cho. A club called 'True Love'. Asshole! I was scared, so I brought a friend. We ended up being recruited! I was worried about you, Reiji. You never called me back. And who's Kazumi? Shut up. What's it to you? How much does she know? Don't tell me you're quitting the force to become a yakuza. She doesn't know anything? Yakuza are so cheesy You should keep your hands clean. She knows so little, it's scary! What's she talking about? Brother! He heard everything? Yakuza need to wash their cheesy bits? He only heard the last bit! Take a good look. This is my ultra-clean Pearl Cobra! What? How boring. What will my cobra do, now he's awake? Brother... Put him back to sleep. Oh, okay. By the way I have a question. This is a rare Mexican butterfly... It's not about butterflies! I heard most yakuza make their money from drugs these days. It's just a rumour I heard. But I was wondering... Is the Akogi-gumi clean? Did you come to me for the drugs? We don't do drugs. "Drugs are the root of evil." That's my father, Masayoshi Ako's motto. Don't ever mention drugs to me again. All right. Sorry. "Don't they teach girls manners in Tokyo anymore?" Meow! Let me go! No! When a new cat comes to town, the purrfect way to welcome them is... to let them drink saké from your pussy, meow! What are you doing? Who's the tomcat? Reiji... Go fall down a slippery lane, Bowling Ball Head. Bowling Ball Head... Who do you think I am, meow? I'm No.3 at the Chibiki Family of the Hachinosu-kai. Issei Nekozawa, meow! I see. I don't think so. Hachinosu-kai is the biggest yakuza clan in Kansai! Hachinosu-kai and Sukiya-kai enjoy a peaceful co-existence. But their new director, fifth generation boss Aiko decided: It's time to take over Kanto. So you want me to knock off Shuho Todoroki, meow? Patience, Neko. Your role is... to create a spark that'll ignite a war. Spark, meow. Leave the guns. We want them to make the first move. Thanks to you, the war between Hachinosu-kai and Sukiya-kai is... About to explode! May I have your name, purrty boy? I'm No.2 at Akogi-gumi, of the Sukiya-kai... Masaya Hiura. So you're the 'Crazy Papillon', meow? You're a spark, meow. You've finally made your move? Shoot me! I'll drive this pick into your heart as I die! Don't forget your cat-talk, Baldy-locks... - Don't call me that! - Brother! I'll take care of... Baby-size Baldy Locks. Baby-size Baldy Locks?! If Papillon makes the first move, there'll be war. That's just what they want! The only way out is... Mole Vs. Cat? That's funny Okay I'll give you three minutes. Three minutes? I have to neuter the bald pussy in three minutes? Red eye drops, meow! Brother! Help me! It's only been 20 seconds. But the situation has changed somewhat! I can't see a thing! Kazumi... Call Kazumi! Who's Kazumi? Cut the lights. Bring it on, meow! I can't see... But... I'm a mole. I have a third eye! Third eye? That's right. My third eye is latched onto you, and it'll never let go! You're seriously funny I'm over here, meow! You owe me a finger. How about I chew off four at once! Where are you, meow? Where?! Don't move! Mole... Come out! There! My secret weapon: the Mole Punch! What? Take this! Brother! We won. Time to go home, boys. Your fangs gave you away. You saved me from shooting a Hachinosu. Manager! The Akogi-gumi will take over this club, starting today We got a new revenue source. Let's go report to the boss. I'll arrange a Sakazuki. Sakazuki? Wait. I think everything just clicked. You talk about "revenue" and "bullets", but you're really an undercover... Way to go! Sweep her off her feet, cherry boy Reiji... This is the guy I told you about. He handled the idiot from Hachinosu-kai. He helped us avert an all-out war. "Blowfish Milt". "Eye of Tuna". "Crocodile Egg Yolk". He also gave us a new revenue source. "Squid Viscera". "Turban Shell Liver". And this... The secret ingredient. And blood. Deer blood. He's fresh and ready He'll be my right-hand man. If you say so. It's time we based the Sakazuki on contribution level, anyway You! Drink up. It's huge! Is this it? The sacred drink of allegiance, Sakazuki? Yes, sir! If I swallow this... I'll officially be one of them. Gross! Handmade by me, Masayoshi Ako. That stuff's pretty good for you. It wasn't the Sakazuki?! There's no rush, Brother. When we do Sakazuki, it lasts a lifetime. I know that. But, as we sit here, drugs are killing kids out there. Don't ever mention drugs to me again. Papillon seems to be clean. But I can't be sure. He took the bait. Is he the rotten one? We can talk openly here. So? Wanna buy some? I'm not Sakazuki, but it's my version of a contract. We sign it by staking our lives. One bullet each. A 20% chance of death. Pull the trigger to seal the pact. This guy is crazy! Don't underestimate me. You can still pull out. Is he testing me? Or is he serious? Five. Four. Three. Two. One. The pact is sealed. You were the first to actually pull the trigger. From now on, we're equals. Betrayal is punishable by death. Take this in place of a contract. OK, partner. I get my supply from a third party We take it retail. So... The Akogi-gumi do deal in MDMA. No, the group forbids it. No one knows, not even Hiura. So Mr. Ako doesn't know either? Actually I work under his direction. Only the boss and I know of it. He won't get away with this. I'll bust him right now! Calm down! Our target is Shuho Todoroki. We'll give Tsukihara a little more rope. Reiji, how can we help? Do a thorough background check on Tsukihara. Good job, Refit. You've gotten to Ako. You're almost there. What the hell?! Reiji? What's wrong? Longtime, no meow. You! Like my purrty new fangs? What's this? Don't play dumb, meow. Isn't this a sad sight, meow? You shot all my tomcats. How could you forget, meow? This is bullshit! You don't mind, meow? After all, you started it. I'm gonna send your purrty little head to the Akogi-gumi. They can accept that as a declaration of war, meow! If I crush the Sukiya-kai, I'll be promoted to No.2 No hard feelings, meow? Too bad! What? Hello? Nekozawa speaking. It's me, Neko. That boy Kikokawa... He hasn't done the Sakazuki yet. He's still an outsider. But... two of my men are quite hurt. Shut up, idiot! Baldy-locks. Baby-size. Today's your lucky day I'll only kill you half-way! Damn. That was too easy Your leopard print's funny You're the Hachinosu-kai pet? Any last words before I roast you? See you in hell. I'll make takoyaki balls for you. Takoyaki balls? What do you mean? There wasn't any deep meaning... Huh? What's wrong? The world needs funny guys like you. If you ever want to play again, you're welcome. I'll kill you the moment you complete your Sakazuki! So the war starts... as soon as I'm “in". You're a target even before your Sakazuki. I'm impressed. On the other hand... we could offer him as a sacrifice and strike a deal. Unfortunately I've been itching for a fight. They can shove their deal! The Hachinosu-kai aren't even in our league. I knew we'd all agree. That's why I brought these gifts. I even included this one from the US military Check this out! Are you kidding? Why didn't you arrest them for illegal arms possession? Who took away my badge? Me. Yakuza thrive on conflict. I gave them... the perfect opportunity. What should I do? Tell me. Run. Abort your undercover mission. So it was all for nothing, huh? - Kazumi. - You did good. All for nothing... You can have your job back in a couple of years. Unable to make a proper decision... I helped with some debt collection jobs. Clan wars cost money. We had to collect on as much debt as possible. As I said on the phone, times are tough. Brother. Do you have a pilot's license? Welcome to Aoushi Island Welcome to Aoushi Island Name: Akio Sakuno... Name: Akio Sakuno... Debt: 40 million yen. We go way back. He introduced me to this world. He was a swanky guy. But drugs destroyed him. Drug users are losers. They drag everyone down with them. Your friend lives on this island? He had so much debt, he had to disappear. He may be dead. But his parents are still alive. I'll make them pay But they're innocent. Don't make me repeat myself. If war breaks out, we'll need money Yahei & Shizue Sakuno One look and I knew... there was no way they could cough up 40 million yen. Come back later? Are you the parents of Akoi Sakuno? Yes. We are. Did Akio do something? He asked me to give you this. It's about two million yen. He said to tell you he's sorry He hopes this will help. Really? That foolish son of mine? Where is Akio? What's he doing? Your son... He's in the Amazon rainforest, chasing butterflies. Excuse us. Brother, I'm with you. I wanna see how long I can keep up. Huh? I'm not good with words, but... I want to live a life so cool, I give myself goose bumps. I made my decision. Goodbye... Junna. It's time. I've decided to take the Sakazuki. I'm gonna take out all the vermin... that destroy our world with drugs. That's a cause worthy of my life. Here he comes. Shuho Todoroki! The ultimate target of the undercover operation. I'm gonna cuff him... with the metal of justice! What's with the look, punk? Who the hell are you'? He's the one I'm giving This kid'? Why'd you give me the eye'? Because... I'm out for you. What? One day... I'll be right behind you. I'll overtake you. And then... I will become the ultimate man! For this day and age, he has a lot of passion. Brings back memories, doesn't it, Ako? Yes. From now on, you'll be under our protection. But betrayal is unforgivable. Once you take Sakazuki, you're yakuza to the bone. If you betray us, you'll disappear, bones and all. They missed the mark with the 'betrayal' bit. I'm a mole. An undercover cop. Hello, sir. Don't get too big-headed. Today's the big day huh? Memorised your lines? What the hell? You'll be okay? Yep. Hiura, it's time. Fire yourself up! Don't mess it up, partner. Masayoshi Ako is to become the Father. In acceptance of this role, He will drink from the Sakazuki cup, and share it with his adopted Son. Please do so now. This is a binding oath. Once you drink from the Sakazuki cup, you become the Son oi Masayoshi Ako. According to the Code, if your Father says a crow is white, you must accept it. It is a world defined by strict rules. You must tolerate any hardship, and resolve to serve your Father. If you are ready to take the oath, drink it in three-and-a-half sips and make it part of your body. I can never tum back. What will become of me? Please do so now. I'll never know unless I try it! I said, three-and-a-half sips! This is where I recite my lines. First tuck the cup into your sash! Make it part of your body! Part of my body... Deep inside... What?! Brother... You idiot!! Spit it out! Out! I'll kill you! Spit it out, you idiot! I'll kill you! The Sakazuki of Masayoshi Ako is now... is now deep inside me! The Sakazuki has... become one with my blood and bones! I'll be a good Son! Father! Please take me in! Brothers. Please excuse his breach of etiquette. His manners are despicable... but I witnessed the union of the Sakazuki and his soul. Father, Masayoshi Ako. Son, Reiji Kikukawa. I have witnessed your Sakazuki. Papillon, finish it. In my capacity as Mediator, I hereby conclude this Sakazuki with three claps. Please lend your hands. Congratulations! Congratulations! Bring it on! And then... the war began. I'm going to kill that punk, meow! You're the pride of the Sukiya-kai. We won't let anybody touch you. Kill 'em all! Cover Mr Hiura! Time to die... Kikukawa! What's wrong, Brother? Brother! Brother! You bald-headed pussy! Brother! Why?! Why? Why did you protect me?! I'm... I'm an... Idiot! Take it easy Brother. I knew... this would happen, sooner or later. I've sown... some pretty bad seeds in my time. Bad seeds? Good seeds... and bad seeds. You reap what you sow. That's life. I'm sorry I'm... Make your mark... in the world, Brother. Brother! Are my butterflies... still flying? Yeah, they are. They're flying high! That's good. In order to justify the war, the Hachinosu-kai distributed a proclamation. They sent it to affiliates nationwide. And they also sent it to the police. Wanted: Reiji Kikukawa Akogi-gumi, Sukiya-kai "Kikukawa seriously injured two unarmed Hachinosu-kai members. "He was then initiated as the adopted Son of Masayoshi Ako." What's the plan? What can we do? This was distributed to police nationwide, right? Look at you. Will you ever fly again? I'll avenge you, don't worry. What is it, Tsukihara? The Russian mafia wants us to buy a million units of MDMA. What? A Kansai clan tried offering 800 yen per unit. That was too cheap and too risky so they came to us. Which clan? The Hachinosu-kai. Nekozawa. But... I thought... we didn't deal in... We don't. However... this is a chance to get revenge on the Hachinosu-kai. And the profits will be huge. Two birds with one stone. If this job goes well... I'm sure Hiura will be happy too. Right, Papillon? And... since you can't fly anymore, Tsukihara is now my No.2. No objections, right? Injured beasts must leave the herd. That's the way of the yakuza. I'm counting on you, partner. I'll become my Brother's wings. I'll bring them down... even if it kills me. They're starting to sag. Why do they end up here? What?! Junna. Reiji? Junna... I wanna have sex with you! - Let me have sex! - Huh? Let me! No. No! Where are you going? Let me know if you change your mind. I don't understand. My feelings haven't changed. I want you! I don't get it. Tell me! A man very dear to me... was shot. Did he die? But... he can't fly anymore. So? So... Why did you come here? Why do you want to sleep with me? Every time I faced death, I saw your face. I recalled your face... and thought, "I don't want to die a virgin!" You kept me alive. Because I love you. It has to be you. I'm prepared to die! So I came to see you. Never mind... I'll die a virgin yakuza. Let's do it... Reiji. Junna... But... Never underestimate... a virgin's preparedness. Already? Sorry. Stay still. It feels so good, just holding you. You're hard again! Again? Sorry. It's okay. Stay still. Oh my! I came back to play as promised. Seriously? No, I'm fine... but I am close! I held on! Okay! A little longer! I love you, Reiji! Don't say that! The Sukiya-kai are the wholesalers of evil Shuho Todoroki is at the top! Bust him, go deep! Go deep, bust him! Mole! Mole! Enough already! There's no second verse! Go away! Reiji! Go away... Reiji! Crap! What? Nothing. Why aren't you looking at me? Is it true they're buying Russian MDMA? Yep. A million units. Are you kidding? That's more than we confiscate in a year. Eat up. Tsukihara is going to undercut the Hachinosu-kai. Tsukihara? What? What's our ultimate goal? To put Shuho Todoroki behind bars. Then it's essential we arrest Tsukihara, too. Because Tsukihara is... Todorokis illegitimate child. Illegitimate child, indeed. Born to his mistress, he made Ako take him under his wing. Now Tsukihara runs Todorokis side businesses and finances. Selling and profiting from drugs. Todoroki's a bad-ass alright. Even his child-rearing's dirty So Reiji, I suggest you eat up and run hard. Time to flee. Again?! Wanted: Reiji Kikukawa "Attempted murder"? Pretty impressive. The Hachinosu-kai want me dead... Now the police want me, too? The Chief couldn't ignore the faxes they sent out. Couldn't you stick up for me?! But that would mean exposing you as a mole. All your work would have been for nothing, Reiji. - Can I have some more radish? - Okay By the way your "Brother" was abducted from hospital. "Abducted"? The CCTV caught a guy covered in leopard tattoos. It's him! Reiji, you look different. The look in your eyes... Oh, did you finally lose it? So... Big difference, huh? Thought so. Reiji... I'm so glad... I saw you before I died. Reiji, take this. For good luck. Hold it tight... As though it's me. This is... Why?! What's his problem? Shut up! Calm down! I won't tell anyone. Just tell me, partner. Trust me! If something happens, I could help you. How do you get the MDMA? There's no way the police or the DEA can find it. Dogs. Tsukihara's running a dog food business in Yokohama. It's a cover for his drug business. Reiji got a hold of this. There it is, MDMA! Smart guy. Good job, Reiji! This is our best ever chance to bring down the Sukiya-kai. What's the "go" sign? Haven't you seen it yet? I'm looking at it now. Then you can guess. I pass. An orangutan! This is where the ship will dock. Tsukihara will be watching them unload. The DEA will be here. Police Crime Unit here. Give us the sign when they complete the transaction. This is the sign. But Reiji, there's one problem... We doubt Nekozawa will keep quiet. After all, you're his main target. He will come after you. We want to protect you... But unfortunately we can't. Why not?! No one, other than us, knows you're a mole. The police will be out to nab you, too. The only way to prove your innocence... is to bring down Todoroki and complete your mission. Or, if you could end the war between the Hachinosu-kai and the Sukiya-kai, you could prove your own innocence. Listen, Reiji: a million units of MDMA will destroy thousands of lives. I know. Drug users are losers. I know, but... Rule Four! If you keep your resolve, nothing is scary! But I'm scared shitless! Good seeds... and bad seeds. You reap what you sow. That's life. Make your mark... in the world. Brother. I'll do it. I'll bring down Shuho Todoroki... and the Hachinosu-kai! "Sounds good!" Let's get outta here. Good job, Nureyev. When the goods leave the ship, we'll transfer 864 million yen. We'll unload at 6 pm. Reiji. Be tough, go all the way And then... run. Crime & Punishment I'll catch the goods in customs. You have to make sure Tsukihara pays, so we'll have hard evidence. Then it's 'Orangutan Time'! Huh? What's going on? It's dog food! No MDMA? It can't be! They fell for it. Your guys must be panicking. Fell for it? What are you talking about? I won't tell anyone. Just tell me, partner. Spoken like a true police dog. And you took dog food from the Yokohama warehouse. We caught you on the security cameras. Go! We're heisting your heist, meow! Cops? Nekozawa, from the Hachinosu-kai? You got the wrong cat. We're just... doing an emergency drill, meow. Emergency drill? - We're sorry Nekozawa isn't a very good liar. - Idiot! It is Nekozawa. Arrest him! Meow! Akagiri! What's wrong? Did you find the goods? Not the goods, the cat! The bald-headed pussy? Let's go in, before it gets confusing! - But... - But... - Whithout... - Without the goods... They can't arrest me. You knew all about it, but you didn't come after me? Was there ever a transaction? The transaction is real. It's nearly complete. Nice try. What? It's time, sir. Okay Double-check. I'm sure. They're leaving the ship. Now they're swimming. They're swimming? Who are? How? How are they bringing the MDMA ashore? We've confirmed your payment of 864 million yen. It was a pleasure. Sorry partner. This is bad. Real bad. They're swimming? No way! Dogs? There are so many dogs! Are you serious?! That's so stupid! Who's stupid, meow? Baldy! I'll kill you, goddammeow! The dogs... I have to tell the Chief! Is that an orangutan? Should we go in? No! That's not an orangutan! He's spinning around... Once. Twice. Three times... Ruff! It's a dog! He's mimicking a dog! And? Catnip! Shit! He's a dog. He's carrying stuff on his back... - He's running away? - No! He's swimming! He's doggy-paddling! They're carrying the drugs? Can't be. Akagiri, go after the dogs and confiscate the drugs! We're going in! Let's go! Don't forget our first priority! Make sure we catch Reiji Kikukawa! Me?! Sorry Refit. In order to provide Japan with a better future... you're getting sacrificed. I am... not a virgin anymore! I'm a man! And a man never turns his back on his enemy. Bring it on! I'm not letting you steal the show! You... Kuroken! Where the hell were you, meow? I dreamt of a rare butterfly. Butterfly? Papillon? He can't fly anymeow! I wonder if that's so? Butterﬂy, butterﬂy... Butterﬂies ﬂutter in the field... What's with the creepy music? No way... It's a Resurrection Song! Resurrection? Yo, Brother! You're making quite a scene. I know that voice... Papillon? But you have legs... He does. They grew back? Idiot! I ordered them specially! Papillon. Brother! Masaya Hiura is back on track! Outta my Way! He's a monster, meowww! That's too amazing. What's with your legs? Let me explain... I'll only say this once, so listen carefully A doctor who didn't speak Japanese... made me some bad-ass prosthetics. The end. Huh? That's all? What do yakuza need? They need to be funny Well said, Brother. It's time to go crazy! Leave 'em to me! Go get him, Bro! Outta my Way! Well done, Reiji. Kazumi! You did good. Mission accomplished. Thanks to you, we confiscated the MDMA. You saved thousands of lives. You did great. Now run. What about Tsukihara? Leave it to us. Take a vacation. Go! I can't leave it to you. What? I'm bringing him down myself! I have to! I'm bringing him down. Don't die, mole. I'm not giving up, meow! You're funny bald pussy! Don't call me bald, meow! Idiot! I'm going nowhere. Then I'm coming to get you. Partner... We had a promise. Betrayal is punishable by death. You rotten... That's right... I'm rotten to the core. Does it hurt? Cry. Beg for your life. Then I'll shoot you. Even if I die... I won't let you get away You... would look great behind bars. Try it. Are you immortal? Of course not. That really hurt, asswipe! Reiji Take this. For good luck. Hold it tight. As though it's me. This is... Please... don't die, Reiji. Love is stronger than bullets! Apparently. Give me a break, Kikukawa. Now it's my turn. I only need one shot. Tsukihara! You've spread drugs all over Japan. Now you'll pay for it! Just kidding. Live... And atone for your sins. Tsukihara wouldn't confess to taking orders from above, even if his life depended on it. He'll protect his Father and take all the blame. That's the Son's duty, in his world. I didn't bust Shuho Todoroki. I didn't even bust Masayoshi Ako. But I dealt a blow to the Sukiya-kai. The Chief of Police commended me. However... I did help end the war between the Hachinosu-kai and the Sukiya-kai. And with the mission successfully completed, I was free. Junna... I'm coming home. I just thought of something funny, Brother. Toma lkuta Riisa Naka Takayuki Yamada Yusuke Kamiji BRING IT ONNNN!! Mitsuru Fukikoshi Kenichi Endo Sarutoki Minagawa Koichi Iwaki Ren Osugi Takashi Okamura Shinichi Tsutsumi What?! I'd like to point out... Our Sakazuki is now void. What? You promised there'd be no drugs. You broke that contract, and that breaks all contracts. I'm starting my own group. What? What did you say? And the No.2 of the Hiura-gumi is... this guy, Reiji Kikukawa. Me? Your No.2? Now I'm in real deep! Where are we going, Brother? First, we'll dominate Kansai. We're taking over the Hachinosu-kai's HQ. And, after we dominate the west, we'll crush Shuho Todoroki and the Sukiya-kai. What do you think, Brother? Sounds like fun! I'm coming for you, Janna! No, actually, I mean... Shuho Todoroki! I'm gonna throw your ass in jail!
