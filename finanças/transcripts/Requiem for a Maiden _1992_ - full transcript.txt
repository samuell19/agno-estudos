And you will sleep like a baby. Lie down. Did you hear me? Lie down. That's it. Close your eyes and sleep. Do you understand? Close your eyes! What do you want? Are you staying with us? No, I'm here only for the night. - You aren't staying here forever? - As if I would. Quiet! And sleep! That's Péťa. You have to obey her. We have to go to sleep. You're staying here. I know you are. I'd have to be simple to stay here. Marika Fárová, born 1968, mother died when she was four, lived with her father, October 25, 1983 he brutally raped her. Come on, they've opened up. Silence! Put your hands behind your backs. Do you hear? Let's wait for breakfast. Get your hands away from your face! Leave that marmalade alone! Don't pick your nose! She's new, they brought her in last night. There will be trouble with her. Don't play with the marmalade! Stop staring and eat! Božíková, stop talking and eat! Come on, stop playing and eat! - Are there all girls here? - Take the roll in your hand! - Who's the one that keeps ranting on? - Take the roll in your hand and eat! Jesus Christ, that's so much work with you! Let's go, quickly! Come on! Up, down. No one's playing the cripple! One, two. One, two. Down, up. One, two. Keep the pace! Faster! One, two. One, two. Up, down. One, two. One, two. One, two. Keep the pace. - You've got to exercise! - I'm not doing this. What are you waiting for? I'm not some trained monkey. You're bawling like an idiot! You'll do what they do. I'm not catering for some crazy. You're the crazy one and I'm going to complain about you. One, two! Good. Put your clothes on. Sit down. What does this remind you of? - A butterfly. - A butterfly, good. And this? I don't know. A bird with long ears. A bird with long ears, very good. And this? Fire. Fire. I haven't heard that before. Good. Now, read these numbers. If you're looking for your room, it's one floor down. But someone's crying. Can't you hear it? She's sick, like all the girls on this floor. If you slept like the others you wouldn't hear it. Why is it locked? She might have fallen out of bed. Go to bed, little girl. You had to obey your father as well before he... If you're good, you'll like it here. - Good night. - If you can't sleep, count sheep. When I was young I used to count sheep, too. The first sheep jumped over the fence. The second sheep jumped over the fence. The third sheep jumped over the fence. Leave it, it's for the carers! See how clever you are. Would you like one, too? Take one. You have to breathe it in. Are you crazy? What if she'll like it more than I like her? Tidy all this up! Hurry up! "Lenin"! "Lenin", you idiot! I said "Lenin"! You'll get shower again. Put it in there! Come on! Did you draw this? It's nice. Why do you keep drawing the same door handle? - Well, girls, finish up. - Hurry up, into line! Péťa, get the tools together and we'll go and wash. Quickly! Come on! - He wears striped trousers. - Give it to me! And polished shoes and goes round with girls from the factory. Look. - The princess... - The princess at the ball she lost her beads, her dad, a mighty king, called Honzík. The princess at the ball lost her beads. Her dad, a mighty king, called Honzík. Give her the beads. Don' do that. May I clap? Quiet! Bedtime! It stinks here! What have you got there? Where did you get it from? You can't have that here. Who put it on for you? Where did you get it from? Give it to me! You could hurt yourself. You can't bawl like that here! Péťa! The princess at the ball lost her beads. Here's a nice snack, eat it up! You'll calm down. - Don't I bother you? - Péťa, put her to bed. Marika, I'm sad. Come on. Thank you. One is the way to Tábor, the other is the way from Tábor. Where is a telephone here, Johanka? A telephone. You take it in your hand and talk into it. You hear someone on the other end. - Who? - The person you're calling. - Who? - Quiet! I need to sleep! Come on. There. - Hello. - What are you doing here? What are you doing here? What are you grinning at? Be quiet! Quiet! - Help! - Shut up, someone will come. Quiet! Be quiet! Be quiet! Be quiet! - Let her go! - What, she... Wait! It strings! Shut up, or Procházková will come. And you'll have to explain why you wanted to do in the repairman. I'd like to know what he was repairing around here. - How's my behaviour? - Dainty. - Thank you. - You forgot your tools, didn't you? There are some jobs I don't need special tools for. You know, girl? That's it, girls. Off you go to bed. - I need to make a phone call. - Really? Where to? To the Hradec children's home, where I belong. There's a phone over there, if you can manage it. This is an internal phone. And that one's locked. If you don't let me phone, I'll tell them about your friend. What have you done? Do you hear me? What have you done? - Shut up! - Get her injection! I don't want anything to do with what goes on here. Or with your pills and drugs either. They've used up the same amount for the whole of last year. As if they we're using it for a herd of elephants. We're not going to stand this from you, doctor. To make things clear, it is within my power to punish any of the girls. When the new training head comes, let her do as she wants. It's shit-all use anyway! That's where you're very wrong. You can't do what you want here. And you can't use these as punishment. They're for calming the girls down! Only girls on the list approved by you get the shower. Two years ago there were only four girls on the list. Now there are thirty-five! Well, it's more of them. What can I do? Volfová's supposed to take care of it. I can't do everything. There's no record of the injections in the punishment book. You show up here once a week. Once every three weeks. And you think you can tell us what to do? František, here's a test done by one of your girls. It's a completely normal test, over 100 points. It must have been done ages ago, I don't know whose it is. There are some things no one can understand. Like, how can a doctor have so much alcohol in his blood? Goodbye, František. So everything's all right here? Come in, Líza, and see what a great deal I did today. I swapped an Aero for this lovely Bugatti. It's a 2300, from 1934. Look at those lights. I've been looking for this for ten years. Hello. What are you doing here? What do you want? - Did someone send you here? - I came here to ask... I don't belong here, I should be in Hradec. I thought you could have a look at my files. I'm Marika Fárová. - Say it again. - Fárová. Fárová. Fárová Marika? I've never heard that name before. I don't know. The National Committee sent you to this institution. There're some crossings-out here. Must be the date. What a fucking mess! - Who sent you to me? - I did. I don't belong here. I'm not like the others. Yeah. Is Kubyová there? No? Well, you come, then. Quickly! The wards are wandering around up here. One's standing right in front of me. Come on! If you misbehave you'll have to be punished. Take this pile out to the cart. Yes. Do it like this. Wait. I know you're different. They bring them here and they take them away again. Yeah. I'll help you. Johana! Where are you meant to be, Johanka? Who are you meant to obey? Your carers who look after you or your friends? You'll have to be punished. - Go and get it ready. - What'll you do to her? She'll get some pills. Help me! - Me? - You won't help me? What are you waiting for? You're only getting some pills. Sit down. Take your shoes off. That's it. Legs up. That's right. Monkey's going to sleep, too. Now, go to sleep! Goodnight. Get up, you can make a phone call. That's your reward for not telling on us. The old bag would give us anything today, she's celebrating. - What is she celebrating? - She's going to America to see her son. - She won't be here anymore? - Only as a ward. Here you go. Hallo? Hradec children's home? This is Fárová Marika. I'm supposed to be with you but I'm at Na Šancích. I'm supposed to be with you. Social welfare told me. I know what the time is. This isn't a joke! - Wait, quiet! - What's the matter? - Procházková. - Who? - Procházková. Hurry up! - Wait! You hide here! Quick! The wine! Where have you been, Zdena? We're celebrating, we're drinking! You look so nice today, madam Procházková. Come on! Well, I'm almost sorry I'm going. I want to go on celebrating. What are these keys doing here? Where are you calling now? Don't tell me you're calling your boyfriend. He's somewhere here anyway. I wanted to call Hradec for Fárová. What's going to happen to her. She was sent here, her papers are here and that's that! I'm going to call to say I'm celebrating. You only get a chance like this once. I mean... The prick! I couldn't hold out any longer. Where did you learn such good English? Viki just needed to make a call. All the phones are locked, every penny is saved but you call to America every day? That's great. - Good, right? - That's great. How come you keep a hunk like this for yourself? Such a cock ready for plucking, such a sweet lollipop! Hiding the mentally ill as well! Come out! Look, Fárová, before I shut you in the cage, have a drink with me. - She couldn't sleep. - Yeah. - Thank you. - Thank you. Here! Down it like the imperial officers! Enough! Well, Marika. You've got a lively imagination. Social care institutions aren't ghostly castles. She says she belongs here. Right, Marika? They're all mentally ill children. Zuzana, would you speak like that about your friends? Five more girls are to come here but no Fárová. - How come? - You're not here. - My name must be there! - Perhaps they forget about you. Girls, go to your room, take her to dinner and then we'll see. - Thank you. Goodbye. - Bye. Goodbye. Hold your hair up. Let's see. Well. Do you like it like that? Take it. I can have as much of it as I want. - Thank you. What's that? - That's a hair spray. What's up? - Bastards! They want to send me back! - Wait, that's bullshit. Your carer didn't believe a word I said. Bye. And thanks. Where can we find comrade Burešová? Yes, I... Up there on the left. Sit! Where are we going? Where are you taking me? - Tell me where we're going! - Why did I get into this? I'm not going back. Stop! I'll jump out! Get back! What are you doing? Shut the door! Help! We nearly get ourselves killed. What a pity. Hi. Come in. Over there, go. Sit down. - Miss! - Yes! - We'll have two tonics and a coffee. - Yes. Coffee for your girlfriend? - For my girlfriend? - Yes. Of course, Viennese coffee. Right, darling? I think you're talking out of the top of your head. If it was as bad as you say, someone would've complained. Or Zdena would have said something. No one cares what's going on in a place like that. Do you know where Krocová used to work before? At an abattoir. Procházková was thrown out of the army for drinking. It's better with a spoon. Wait here. Let's go, I've got something to do. - Where are we going? - To some friends of mine. Let's go. I'll just go and pay. Can I pay? And I'll take that box of chocolates. Thanks, bye. Where are we? - You bastard! - I was thinking about it. I believe it would be better like this for all of us. Bullshit, better only for you. If you obey them, if you don't provoke them, they won't punish you. You have to go there, you have no choice. - What if I lived with you? - They'd get me for kidnapping. You belong here with those women. They're responsible for you, not me. You can't do anything about it. Here's my work number, call if you need me. Come on. It'll be all right. I'll find out where you're supposed to be. I'll make some calls, all right? You may even get used to it. Wait, I almost forgot. Give this to them. Give it to the one who you annoy the most. - It'll work, you'll see. - Bye. INSTITUTE OF SOCIAL WELFARE NA ŠANCÍCH Off you go. Take care! We have to maintain the positive things in this home. Procházková maintained authority, which was good for us, but she treated all the girls the same. We have to treat each girl individually. So, Fárová Marika must be punished in a specific way for her escape. Comrade Suková, think up an interesting punishment and write it in the book. That doesn't make sense. We can't punish her if she has faith in us now. She made an effort and came back. We must forgive her, it's our duty. As regards your punishments... Our punishments, you mean? We're all responsible for what's going on here, aren't we? Fárová's only here temporarily. She'll be treated like all the others while she's here. I think she does belong here. Thank you. I'm sorry I ran away and caused you problems. I've brought you a present. You've disappointed me. Greatly. Have some. Péťa, take two, you're the boss. Yeah, I'll take some. Help yourselves, don't be shy. - Did you buy it? Thank you. - No, I got it from a handsome prince. In a beautiful palace. There was chocolate everywhere. And we got into his carriage and he touched my ass. Fárová, what's going on here? You don't know sweets aren't allowed in the rooms? What are you doing? What've you got there? Show me! Show me! You pig! Péťa, throw it away and clear all this up. Do you hear me? No. What do you mean, no? You little shit! Just swallow the holy water! Turn it off! Oh my God, it's you, Mrs Suková? We thought you were one of the girls. Just look at them. Who eats sweets won't eat at all. Eat up, you've had your punishment. Let's go, quickly! Come on! One, two, move it! One, two. Stop giggling. One, two. Keep running! One, two. Keep spacing! One, two. - Excuse me. - Get into line with the others. Has Viki called? He said, he would call someone to get me away from here. I've had enough trouble because of you. Ask Volfová, she decides, not Viki. He's only a waiter. What can I do if I can't write or call anyone? Just be glad we brought you back from Hradec. If the police did, you'd be stuck in the cage for a month. Watch out! Don't you know where you're supposed to be? Here are those two girls from room four. You think you're not a moron? We'll make one out of you. - Let me go! - What are you doing? - What's the matter? - She's having a fit. Let me go! No! I want to see the vial of what you gave her. We couldn't find it, she made such a mess here. - How long has it been? - It's been about four hours since the fit. Right, Jiřina? - What that's from? - Why do you ask? You don't recognise a bruise when you see one? Fárová is one of our worst wards. We have to control her. Do you understand, doctor? The regulations of the social care institutions state that the use of physical force has to be immediately recorded in the ward's book. Have you got it? I don't have time for your pearls of wisdom. We're here more than at home, dear doctor. These are our children! Have you got any? Do you know what they are? Where are you going? You're going to leave her like that? No way! She has to get moving! Come on! Get up! Let's go. - Hotel Sport. - Hi, Viki, it's me, Marika. Viki, please, come here, I can't take it anymore. I don't know what to do. Please. When shall I come? I don't know. Tomorrow night? - Tomorrow night? - Yes. You're great, I'll be waiting. Johanka, see what I've got. Look. - A clown. - No, it's lipstick. I want to look nice. So he'll like me. How do I look? Very dainty. Hide it somewhere, Johanka. Let's go. - Hello. - Hello. I wanted you to like us. Let me see that, Johanka. Don't be afraid. It's nice, isn't it? Who lent it to you? I found... I found it. You'll have to go into the cage. Won't you tell me? It's mine! I'm telling you, it's my lipstick! Do you hear me? That's my lipstick! No! - Hi! - Quiet! Quiet, right. I'll put my leg through. Is Zdena here? - No. - That's good, then. I locked up the pub and I'm here. Did you call someone? Did you arranged anything? I'm filthy. I have to wash before I talk to a lady. What's the matter? - Aren't you afraid of them? - Whom? Those women here? Afraid of them? That's funny. Wait. Viki, you're the only one I trust here. I'll give you a letter, a very important letter. Read it and give it to the welfare people. You've got sad eyes again. What are mine like? - Watery. - Watery? You're surprised I came, aren't you? No, I believed you when you said you'd come. You did? That's nice of you. You're prettier today. You look older. There's someone here. So she brings young men in here. - We'll see about that. - Good evening. Why are you doing this? Is this really necessary? You've got real taste, Viktor. Marika's one of our worst cases. That's not true! Don't believe her. She's the mad one, she's not normal. Wait. But I came to see Zdena. She's not here, she had the morning shift. Let's go, Viktor, I'll take you to the main entrance. Bye. It's not Marika's fault. I usually come through the window. It's weird, isn't it? Well, it is. Let me tell you, it must be difficult to tell if someone's mad or not. They've been saying I'm mad since I was a kid. What has she told you? She must have said some stupid things. - Who? That girl? - Yeah. She did say something. She said she didn't like it here. But you can't believe everything. Did she want anything from you? She just asked to me send a letter. Maybe to her family. - Have you got it? - No, she didn't give it to me. Where's the letter? - Show me your pockets. - No! No! I knew that bitch would be dangerous. Come on, Jiřina. How did you get that? You have to be strong, Marika. Evil will be punished. Always. You have to have faith, Marika. That's the main thing. You have to believe in yourself. And you have to know there's a greater force that is driving us all. Comrade, don't you know that without permission the wards can't stay in bed during the day? You're breaking the disciplinary code. I don't want to see you here again. Madam, I'm telling you, don't push it. I've been here for 17 years and I've been through a lot. But this is going too far! I've kept silent until now. - You'll get a chance to speak soon. - Fárová doesn't belong here. Just pray she doesn't talk. Staff without qualifications. A high death rate! And you're responsible! - Enough! - I want to adopt Marika. You know she was never deprived of her rights. I'm going to file a complaint against you. Well, well, Mrs Suková. - You're still here? - Where're Fárová's papers? I don't know. But there's a letter here. - What letter? - From welfare. If we want to move her to Hradec we have to write her medical opinion. Do you know her? Is she a difficult case? Yes, she is. I'll sort it out. Where're you off to? - Madrid, great, isn't it? - Madrid. That's wonderful. To a conference on handicapped children. I'm even giving a conference paper. Institute of Social Welfare Na Šancích. Yes, of course. What? - What's going on? - I don't know. They're coming here. Quick! Get everything in order! Or Madrid's fucked! Look at him. He's a funny clown, isn't he? Hello. - Is Anna Suková here? - That's me. Police, come with us, please. - That's good. Next! - Come on. Take that off. What now? Come quickly! - How's my behaviour? - Fine, but we've got to go! Marika! Marika, do you hear me? Open the door! You know it's no use so don't be silly! Marika, listen, we'll go away from the door. You don't have to be afraid. Open the door and you both come out. We're going away. Marika! Come on! Come on! Marika! Open the door and go to bed. Agreed? We're going away. Marika! Did you hear me? Let's go. Hurry. Wait. Go over there. Věra, where are you? Věra! - Jiřina! Here I am! - Věra, where are you? Here, in the drying room! The girls are here, too. Come here! Jiřina, come here! It's all over! Věra! Věra. Wait here. Get up, girls! Fuck! - Come quickly! - What's going on? It's on fire! We've got to get out! Volfová's dead! Hurry! Move! Hurry up! - Milada, that must be everyone! - But there is still somebody upstairs! The second floor is locked. We have to wait for the firemen! Johanka, stay here, don't move! Do you understand? Stay here. - How's my... - Dainty. Where are you going? Marika. - Why don't you do something? - There's no water. Do something! There are people up there! - Can't you see the bars? - You can get up there. You go up there, then! And don't get yourself dirty! Come down! Don't risk your life for those imbeciles! It'll be better for them like this. Go and have it away with them, then! What did you say? They're dying up there! Do you hear me? Come up there with me! Come up! Marika! Marika! Marika! Johanka! Marika. Twenty-six wards perished during the fire in 1984. Volfová and Procházková were sentenced to one year's imprisonment for negligence. Krocová received nine months' conditional sentence. Marika Fárová was sentenced to five years for arson.
