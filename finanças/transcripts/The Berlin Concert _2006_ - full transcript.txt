It's the familiar story of the shepherd. The poor boy wanted to tell it but fell asleep. In sleep there is forgetfulness. How I envy him! I too would like to sleep like that, in sleep at least to find forgetfulness! I keep looking only for peace. I'd like to be able to forget everything. But all my efforts are in vain. Before me I see always her charming features! Peace has been taken from me alone. Why must I suffer so much? That woman! She still touches my heart! Fatal vision, leave me! You hurt me so much! Alas! Oh, dear daddy, I like him, he's handsome. I want to go to Porta Rossa to buy the ring! Yes, yes, I want to go there! And if it's useless to love him I'll go to the Ponte Vecchio and throw myself into the Arno! I'm pining, I'm tortured! Oh, God, I could die! Daddy, have pity, have pity! Ah, appear! Appear, star of my heaven! Golden bee, whose honey is love! Raise these shadowing veils that conceal your charming face! Raise these shadowing veils and let me show to all the rising sun of your face and your gaze, your starlit gaze. Appear! Appear! Yes, appear, sun of my eyes, the only truly precious treasure, the only thing that sparks love! I have captured you and you have captured me. Be my victory prize! Anahita! Raise these shadowing veils that conceal your charming face! Raise these shadowing veils and let me show to all the rising sun of your face and your gaze, your starlit gaze. Appear, Anahita! Now as the darkness deepens all harsh sounds die away. Now my turbulent heart finds peace in this embrace and calm refreshment. Let cannons roar and all the world collapse if after the immeasurable wrath comes this immeasurable love! My splendid warrior! What anguish, what deep sighs and high hopes have strewn the path to our glad union! Oh, how sweet to murmur thus together! Do you remember? You used to tell me of your life in exile, of violent deeds and suffering long endured. And I would listen, transported by the tales that terrified but thrilled my heart as well. I would describe the clash of arms, the fight and violent thrust toward the fatal breach, the assault when hands clung to bastions amid the hissing darts. Then you would lead me to the glaring desert, to scorching sands, the country of your birth. Then you would relate your sufferings, tell me of chains and slavery's agony. When I told my story, your lovely face was softened by tears, your lips by sighs. Upon my darkness shone a radiance, heaven and all the stars in benediction. And I descried upon your dusky temples genius's ethereal beauty shining there. You loved me for the dangers I had passed. And I loved you that you pitied them. I loved you for the dangers you had passed. And you loved me that I pitied them. And you loved me. - And you loved me - And I loved you - that I pitied them. - that you pitied them. Let death come now! In the ecstasy of this embrace I meet my hour of hours! Such is the rapture of my soul, I fear, that never more to me may be vouchsafed to know such bliss in all the hidden future of my fate. May heaven dispel all cares and may love not change throughout the changing years. To that prayer of yours may the heavenly host reply, "Amen". "Amen" be the reply. Ah! Joy floods my breast so piercingly that I must lay me down and pant for breath. A kiss. Othello! A kiss. Another kiss. The blazing Pleiades sink beneath the waves. The night is far advanced. Come. - Venus is radiant! - Othello! From the depths of the holy temple, decked with gold and flowers a woman appears. I can still see her! The kneeling crowd looks at her, astonished and softly murmurs: Behold, it is the goddess who rises out of the darkness and stretches her arms toward us! Her veil is raised! O vision! O dream! The crowd is on its knees! Yes, it is she! It is the goddess most lovely and most beautiful! Yes, it is she! It is the goddess who steps down among us! Her veil is raised and the crowd is on its knees! Through the crowd she opens a pathway! Her long veil already hides her face from us! My eyes, alas, follow her in vain! Yes, it is she! It is the goddess who has just brought us together again. And, ever mindful of my vow, like a brother I will cherish you! It is she! It is the goddess who today reunites us! Yes, let us share the same fate! Let us be friends to the death! They all say it's a lie that I love you because they've never seen me in love. I swear to you that even I don't understand why your gaze has enchanted me. When I'm close to you and you are happy I wouldn't want you to think of anyone else. I'm jealous of even the thought that I might remind you of some other love. Swear to me that however much time goes by you'll never forget the moment when I met you. Look at me for there is nothing deeper or greater in this world than the love I gave you! Kiss me with a loving kiss as no one has kissed me since the day I was born. Love me, love me to insanity and then you'll know the bitterness I'm suffering because of you. I myself don't know why people speak at once of love when they come near me, look into my eyes and kiss my hands. I myself don't know why people talk of the magic that no one can resist when they see me, when they come past me. But if the red light is glowing around midnight, if everyone is listening to my song then the reason becomes clear. My lips kiss with such passion, my arms are soft and white. It's written in the stars: you should kiss, you should love. My feet glide by, my eyes tempt and glow. And I dance as if entranced for I know: my lips kiss with such passion. In my veins flows a dancer's blood for my beautiful mother was Queen of the Dance in golden Alcazar. She was entrancingly beautiful. I've seen her often in my dreams. She beat the drum for wild dancing, then all eyes burned bright. She's been wakened anew in me. We share the same destiny. At midnight I dance as she did and feel only this: my lips kiss with such passion, my limbs are soft and white. It's written in the stars: you should kiss, you should love. And I dance as if entranced for I know: my lips kiss with such passion. The swallows have flown from my cold, sunless land, seeking springs of violets, nests of love and happiness. My little swallow flew off without leaving me a kiss. Without saying goodbye she fled. Do not forget me. My life is bound to you. I love you more and more. You are always in my dreams. Do not forget me. My life is bound to you. There will always be a nest in my heart for you. Do not forget me! O gentle maid! O sweet face suffused with the light of the rising moon! In you I recognize the dream I'd like to dream for ever! Ah! Love, alone command me! My soul is already a-throb with the sweets of passion. Love, alone command me! My soul is a-throb with the sweets of passion. Oh, how sweetly his flattery falls upon my heart. - Love, alone command me! - Love trembles in a kiss! No, I beg you! You're mine! Your friends are waiting for you. Are you already sending me away? I'd like to say but I dare not. Tell me. Suppose I came with you? What? Mim√¨! It would be lovely to stay here. It's cold outside. I shall be near you! - And when we return? - Wait and see! Give me your arm, my dearest. I obey, my lord! Say you love me. I love you! My love! My love! Inside this little room, so cold and dark, where once the sun would enter, I am now alone, in fear that my heart is wasting away. The fear that this sickness will destroy me and I'll never see Naples again, I'll never see you again. I wish I could go back to you for just one hour, my Naples, to hear you singing with a thousand mandolins. I wish I could go back to you as before, my love, to be able to kiss you, to feel your embrace. This fever that never leaves me, this fever won't let me live any more. I wish I could go back to you for just one hour, my Naples. I wish... I wish... I wish... But I'm in torment! Only you, you're the only thing I'll see for ever, in my eyes, in my words and in ev'rything I do, nothing else but you ever! And there's nothing for me but Maria, ev'ry sight that I see is Maria. Tony, Tony... Always you, ev'ry thought I'll ever know, ev'rywhere I go you'll be! All the world is only you and me! Tonight, tonight, it all began tonight. I saw you and the world went away. Tonight, tonight, there's only you tonight, what you are, what you do, what you say. Today, all day I had the feeling a miracle would happen. I know now I was right. For here you are and what was just a world is a star tonight! Tonight, tonight, the world is full of light, with suns and moons all over the place. Tonight, tonight, the world is wild and bright, going mad, shooting sparks into space. Today the world was just an address, a place for me to live in, no better than all right. But here you are and what was just a world is a star tonight! Goodnight, goodnight, sleep well and when you dream dream of me tonight! The moon is high on the sea. Mamma mia, we'll be leaping. It's the perfect time for dancing. Plenty of lovers will be there. Quick, come here, girls. Dance in a circle. Each one of you will have a cheerful, handsome lad. While there's still a star in the sky and the moon is shining the loveliest boy and girl will dance all night long. Leap, leap, turn, turn. Every pair turn around. Step forward, step back into the darkness. Close in with the blonde girl, in and out with the dark. Follow on with the redhead, on the spot with the mousy. Hurrah for the circle dance. I'm a king, I'm a sultan. There's nothing like it in the world. It's the greatest pleasure there is. When I walk out, when I walk out alone along the street people stop and stare and they seek out my beauty from head to foot. Then I relish the sly desire which shines from eyes and can infer hidden beauties from outward charms. Thus the breath of desire whirls around me and makes me happy! And you who know, who remember and fret, why do you shun me like that? I know full well you'll not tell your sufferings. You'd rather die than speak of your torment! It cannot be; she's a good woman. She cannot be a wicked woman. In her eyes I have seen something special that tells me she is not a fallen woman. She cannot be a common temptress who has poisoned my life. It cannot be for I saw her pray, I saw her love, for I saw her weep. Eyes that shed tears cannot lie. Wicked women do not look like this. I saw two tears trembling in her eyes and I thought they trembled for me. Bright light of my dream, show compassion on my love. For I cannot pretend, for I cannot be silent, for I cannot live. Let's drink from the joyous chalice where beauty flowers. Let the fleeting hour to pleasure's intoxication yield. Let's drink to love's sweet tremors, to those eyes that pierce the heart. Let's drink to love, to wine that warms our kisses. With you I would share my days of happiness. Everything is folly in this world that doesn't give us pleasure. Let's enjoy life, for the pleasures of love are swift and fleeting as a flower that lives and dies and can be enjoyed no more. Let's take our pleasure while its ardent, brilliant summons lures us on. Life is just pleasure. If one still waits for love. I know nothing of that. Don't tell me. But there lies my fate. Let's take our pleasure of wine and singing and mirth till the new day dawns on us in paradise. Yours is my whole heart. Where you are not, I cannot be. Just as the flower wilts when the sunshine does not kiss it! Yours is my loveliest song because it blooms from love alone. Tell me once more, my only love, oh, tell me once more: I love you! Wherever I go I feel you near. I would drink in your breath and sink at your feet in adoration, at your feet alone! How wonderful is your shining hair! Beautiful and dark with yearning is your radiant gaze. If I hear the sound of your voice it is like music. Yours is my whole heart. Where you are not, I cannot be. Just as the flower wilts when the sunshine does not kiss it! Yours is my loveliest song because it blooms from love alone. Tell me once more, my only love, oh, tell me once more: I love you!
