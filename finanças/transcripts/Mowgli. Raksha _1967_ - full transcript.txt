Snesarev Director of Production: A. Zorina Man? A man's cub? Man? I have never seen one. He is completely naked! Give me my quarry! The man's cub is ours! Don't you understand? It is I, Shere Khan, who speak! And it is I, Raksha the Demon, who answer! The man's cub is mine, and only mine! Now go away, or I'll tear you to pieces! We will see what the Pack says on the Council Rock! And what will the Jungle say? So this is a man's cub. Now, was there ever a wolf that could boast of a man's cub among her children? I have heard now and again of such a thing. Shere Khan speaks this much truth... The cub must be shown to the Pack. Lie still, little frog. O... little frog! Mowgli! I will call you Mowgli! Mowgli! Mowgli! Mowgli! Mowgli... Mowgli. Right... But what will our Pack say? Among the wolves lives... a man's cub! We don't care. Mowgli! A frog! A man's cub! Mowgli! Mowgli! Bananas! Bananas! Bananas! Sahi! Sahi! Sahi! Sahi! Sahi! - Oi!.. - Oh!.. - Oi!.. - Oh!.. - O... - Oi!.. - Oh!.. A man's cub has appeared in a wolf pack! Mowgli appeared!.. A man!.. So what? What do you mean, so what? The Jungle is disgraced! Stop this idle talk. O magnificent Bagheera! You're the one I've been looking for! Can you imagine? A man is living with a wolf family! A man? That's interesting. And where did he come from? He's the quarry of Shere Khan! What?! That murderer is hunting Man again?! Sahi the Porcupine passed through here. Whoever is the first to pick up the trail and find Sahi A family of wolves have adopted a man! They have adopted a man! Oh! I told you to find Sahi, not to grab him. You never finish listening to my instructions. How many times do I have to tell yo? Wolves! Man!.. Wolves! You are a Free Tribe, but one of your families took in a man. - Disgrace! - The Jungle is disgraced! - A man in the Pack! - Throw him out! Throw him out! Out! Out! Quiet! Quiet! Like I said, a disgrace! - How can this be? - What will happen now? A man among us! Enough. Settle down We will do as the Pack Council says. They're coming! They're coming! I think... Look well, O Wolves! Aa-uuuu! Well, they seem fine hunters! But there is a man among them. I am against the man. Yes, they will make good hunters, but the man must go back to his own pack. Who speaks for the man? Who else speaks for the man's cub? This is my quarry. Give him to me! Who speaks for the man's cub? He shall not be killed! He shall live! This may be my last fight, but he shall live! Man... Man's cub... Mowgli... l speak for the man's cub. He will be useful to the pack! I myself will teach him. This is my quarry! Who else besides Baloo? Gve him to me. Akela... and ye the Free Tribe, the Law of the Jungle says ''Each creature for himself." That's the Law of the Jungle: ''Each creature for himself." - That's right. - Each creature for himself. Quiet! Quiet! Are you cannibals? Only Shere Khan and his crony Jackal are capable of that. Yes. Thats right. That's right. The Law of the Jungle says that the life of the cub can be bought at a price. Speak, Bagheera. To my words I will add one bull... Yes! That is in accordance with the Law. ...a bull I have just killed. What do you say, O Wolves? What does it matter? Let him run with the pack. He will burn in the sun, anyway. He will die in the winter rains. Where is the bull, Bagheera? There, at the river bend. I will only be a minute! I'll go see where they went. Let Mowgli run with the Pack. Train him well, Father Wolf. That's all right, I'll get you later! Roar all you like... but the time will come when this cub will drag you by your whiskers, or I know nothing of Man. This is the first of the Mowgli stories. (subtitles from FBJ, edited by Niffiwan)
