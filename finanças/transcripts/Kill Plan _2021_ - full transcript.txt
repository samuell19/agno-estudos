Steady with the cargo. We don'’t want any accidents. So, how long have you been a... A hired gun? I was going to say private security. About 15 years. I bet you'’ve seen some pretty good action. I have experience. What was that? It'’s not for you to worry about. Listen, I don'’t know and I don'’t care what'’s in those crates. What I do want to know is whatever inside is secure. I was told I was protecting it, not protecting us from it. What are you doing? It'’s not me. It'’s coming from the back. You need to let me know what'’s inside those containers... now! Ozzie and Harriet. What? We call them Ozzie and Harriet. They'’re a genetic experiment. You made these things in a lab? Allosauruses. What? Dinosaurs. You need to stop this vehicle now! Not an option. Do what you can from back there. I don'’t even know why they'’re like this. They'’re supposed to be sedated! Don'’t shoot them! You all right? Yeah. You'’ve got blood on your lip. Status report? Harrison, I repeat. Status report. Are you okay? Wait! If they'’re out, they will kill us. Oh! Give me your hand. You have to go! Give me your hand! Come on! We just have to wait. Listen. What'’s going on? They called each other off. We have to get them back! They just tore apart one of my men. We have to put them down, Oh, no. We need them alive. I think it'’s time to call in your team, and that'’s an order. Joy here. It'’s me. We have a situation. Understood. How severe? Top scale. How many do you need? Full team. Copy that. Four of us. Negative. Five of you and that includes Deacon. Are you sure about that? You know I don'’t trust him. Right now, we don'’t have a choice. Copy that. Five of us. I'’m gonna send you coordinates. Assemble the team asap. This is no ordinary assignment. The prey you will be hunting is different from anything you'’ve ever encountered before. Be armed and ready. Proceed with extreme caution. Copy that. Those are two of the most valuable creatures on the planet right now. And two of the most dangerous I'’ve ever seen. I'’m not going anywhere, as long as they are out there running around free, Hopefully, they stay put. Are you all right? Yeah, I think so. I just haven'’t seen them do anything like this before. No one should ever have to see anything like that. It'’s not like that. I'’ve seen it pretty bad. This is different. They'’re usually nocturnal. You'’ve seen this before? A lab accident once. They were running a similar experiment at another facility. But there was a problem. We had safeguards in place, but no one ever thought it would escalate like it did, how lethal the subjects could get. It was a disaster, a bloodbath. And this wasn'’t just scientists in lab coats or tech people. It was trained security guards, experienced former military just like you. Even they couldn'’t stop it. Kill me. Kill me! Shh! Slow down. Come on... We thought we had fixed everything that went wrong. We thought we could learn from our mistakes and implement fail safes in case it ever got out of hand again. At least it wouldn'’t be like this. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Just relax. Good, good, relax. That'’s all right. You did enough damage today, okay? I'’m gonna take you back, okay? Relax. Relax. Steady, steady. Stay! Good. That'’s it. Steady, girl! Stop! No! We anticipated that it would be worse. I have a full team of armed mercenaries which, by the way, your company had on retainer for, on their way to intercept your dinosaurs! They killed my man and did this. Pack up, let'’s go! -And do what? -Do what? Get back the product. That'’s what we'’re here for, right? That'’s what you were here for. We have a chance to keep this situation contained. If they expand beyond the edge of this industrial park, they'’ll be in a heavily populated residential area! Pack up, let'’s go! What about your team of buddies? They'’re on their way. Mr. President, we have a bidding war going on. And I realize we have a history. My clout will get you in the room, but that'’s where it ends. Mr. President, normally a country with your GDP wouldn'’t even be considered. Of course, they'’re guaranteed. We'’re running a field test as we speak. Just follow the link I sent you and wait for my announcement. Hang back. I want to scope around and make sure they'’re not waiting to ambush us. We'’re really exposed out here. We need to find a place where we can set up a tracking system. Copy. Hold back while I check the alley. See anything? We should be safe in here until the team shows up. Stay alert. it'’s possible the targets have already infiltrated the building. In that case, we'’re screwed if the team doesn'’t show up soon. Hey, what if you tripped the alarm? I wouldn'’t worry about that. No one'’s been here in a while. Let'’s go. This should work as a temporary command center. You two set up. I'’m gonna go check the side room. Listen. The information you give these people is on a need to know basis. And they don'’t need to know anything. I'’ve seen these jarheads, what they do. They just wanna blow things up. They don'’t care about my investment, but I know you do. Look, they need to know what they'’re up against. if they'’re going to bring them back to us alive and not get killed while trying. Enough, Elaine, enough. Just do your job. We'’ve got no time to waste. I just need five minutes to have the entire area mapped out on our GPS systems. Good. Looks like someone dragged this here to block the entrance. Guys, look at these tracks. Why don'’t you pull around? See if we can get around this thing. What do you think could have made those? Uh, perhaps is bear. A bear that knew enough to drag this hunk of metal in our way? Whoa! What the hell was that? I'’m guessing it'’s the entire reason we'’re here. This looks like the building. It'’s unlocked. Let'’s take it slow. Are you about to tell me that we'’re actually hunting dinosaurs? It'’s a little bit more complicated than that. How much more complicated? You'’re about to find out. I only see four of you. Where'’s Deacon? Yo, Deacs, if you'’re on the comms, we'’re setup in the central office. We need you in here now. Right here. You'’re late. Wasn'’t on call like the rest of you. Well, there'’s a reason for that. We didn'’t want you here. It wasn'’t your decision to make, so I'’m here now. Then try to stick around this time and don'’t leave anyone behind. Enough! If you are here, that means nothing else matters starting now. This is a Code Red. You all knew Harrison. This is what'’s left of him. He is now gone and your mission is to hunt down and retrieve the highly dangerous and highly unique creatures that tore his body apart before devouring him. If you are here, that means any problem or difference you have is now over. Is that clear? Yes, sir! Great. Let'’s get to work. We have to move quickly. The longer we take, the more lives lost especially with those things move into those nearby residential areas. This is Elaine Kelso. She has all the information we need on our targets. Her and I will be eyes and ears back at base camp. She is an expert on everything you need to know about what you will be hunting. Ms. Kelso, please tell my team what they'’re up against. You are dealing with two genetically-grown live and fully matured allosauruses. And you have seen them in action. Yes. Like grizzly bear with body armor! Because these are highly valuable assets, you are to only use deadly force as a last resort. Instead, you'’ll be using some specially designed AR-15s with a high-impact tranquilizer round. AR-15? What? We'’re hunting deer? Sir, you know we work best with our own weapons. You will adapt, soldier. Remember what you were hired to do. I don'’t like this one bit. It'’s not for you to like, Deacon. You'’re here to follow orders. Are you going to have a hard time doing that this time around? No, sir. As I said, you are only to use deadly force as a last resort. And I know some of you are as deadly with your hands and feet as you are with swords and guns and knives. Last resort, soldier! Yes, sir! Each of you will also be wearing a live-linked tracker so we can monitor your every movement from here. We'’ll sweep the outside of the building first. See if we can force them into an enclosed area. We'’ll split up into usual two teams, Red east, Blue west. Are we clear? Yes, sir! Let'’s go. Be careful. Red Team, head east! Blue Team, with me! Comm check, Joy. Check. Gordon. Check. Yeah, it'’s me. We'’re running a little late. Well, don'’t screw this up. You know how valuable this product is. And how important that this test goes smoothly. Yes. They'’re already on them right now. We'’ve worked too long and too hard to just watch this thing fail. Now you realize how important it is that this test succeed. Okay. Will do. I don'’t want to have to send in the drones, Simone. Okay. Bye. Red Team heading east. So far, no signs of the target. Got you, Red Team. All right, listen up, everyone. We have approximately 3,200 civilians only five clicks away from here just to the north. We need to bring those targets alive. But our main goal is to make sure they don'’t get out of the industrial park. Stay alert. Stay frosty. Don'’t assume that a dinosaur can'’t catch you by surprise. I repeat, no matter what you do, keep them from getting out. -Copy that. -Copy that. Copy that. Mutant dinosaurs? Yeah. I still don'’t know how that'’s even possible. With enough money, everything'’s possible, even dinosaurs. Keep the chatter to a minimum, Red Team. Just find the targets. We heard screaming. We'’re going to check it out. Copy that, Red Team. Our initial scan showed no signs of civilians present. Use caution, but find out if we'’re already looking at civilian casualties. Base, we have a handprint. Appears to be blood, no bodies. Copy, Red Team. Watch your six for those grizzlies. There'’s literally nothing. Did they eat them? I don'’t know, but if this is human blood, there'’s no way they survived. I'’m gonna go find higher ground. Try to see them through my scope. Good idea. I'’ll follow the tracks. Gordon, why are you breaking apart from your partner? Where are you going? We need eyes in the sky. He is a sniper. That'’s why he'’s here. Copy that, Red Team. Give me a visual from above. Let me know what you see. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome. You have all been invited for a very specific reason. Your GDP allows you to purchase the product we'’re selling. Now in the interest of security and confidentiality, all participants will remain anonymous whether you purchase our product or not. Now what exactly are we selling? Genetically-enhanced dinosaurs with advanced combat abilities. This miracle rides on the backs of those that have come before that paved the way. These military prototypes have been developed from the initial experiments of Dr. Martinelli at the Triassic Research Facility. This is unlike anything anyone has ever seen before. Not only is it the most significant breakthrough in modern science at the cost of hundreds of millions of dollars, but it is also the biggest breakthrough in biological warfare since the invention of gunpowder. No longer will nations need to send... Oh, my God. ...their young men and women onto the battlefield to die for their country or their cause. PTSD, collateral damage and all the horrors of war and conflict will become a relic of the past. Mr. Hagan, this is Dr. Ovidio, our chief immunologist. He takes care of the animals and make sure their organs are appropriate for transplantation. Charles. This was all I ever wanted when I was like nine years old. And now here you are after millions of years of extinction. Don'’t get near it. No, it'’s okay. This is G-48. She'’s actually responsible for the whole G series. I have to admit, Marissa, I was more than a little skeptical you had real live dinosaurs here. That'’s why I had to come. I didn'’t believe it, but now... We make miracles happen here every day. This miracle, my friend, is our new and improved product. The bidding will start at $500 million dollars each. We have two currently available. Why so expensive? You will be purchasing the most ferocious combat soldiers to ever walk the face of the earth unencumbered by morality or ethics. Now we'’ve arranged a little demonstration for you. I'’ve hired the most deadly mercenaries that money can buy and pitted them against our allosauruses. If you watch on your computer screen, you will see live and in real time just how valuable an asset this is. Enjoy the show. This place is creepy. Oh, it'’s old and quiet. Old and quiet is always creepy. It'’s not what I mean. It'’s empty, sitting in the middle of nowhere. There'’s nothing here. Just us and those things. There! Broken glass. We found something! They'’re here. How can you tell? These edges, they'’re fresh. If this glass was broken any longer, then there'’d be dust and dirt covering the edges. -Hmm. -This is new. They'’re either inside this building or they were. Be on the lookout. They tend to stick together. But that doesn'’t mean they always will. But they usually hide where it'’s dark and maybe a little damp. What do they want with someplace dark and damp? They'’re nocturnal and that'’ll remind them of the lab. They need to know. Know what? No, they don'’t. How much do you want to keep from them just to protect secrets that could help them to help us? Tell me. Uh, if there'’s something I need to tell you that'’s important, I'’ll let you know. I decide what'’s important. That means bringing your creatures back alive and keeping my men safe! Now tell me! One of them is pregnant. And you weren'’t gonna tell me this? Doesn'’t that make the assets more valuable? Of course, it does. Transporting two allosauruses to Costa Rica is tough enough, let alone two with an egg. An egg? No, not an egg. Nothing anyone has even seen before. We'’re talking about life created from life that was created in a petri dish. Don'’t you get it? Elaine has made dozens of them, but they all failed. Sterile, they died. What this is is something the world'’s never seen before. What? One that can get another one pregnant? No, not just that. Survivors. These are the only two test subjects to ever leave that building alive. Go for Deacon? Deacon here. One of them might be pregnant. That'’s supposed to mean something? Mama bear. Things could get hairy. Copy that. You okay? 100%. You brought some shit up earlier with Joy when you first saw her. I need you to be on your game. We'’re good. I'’m counting on it. Base, we got more blood. Go, Red Team! Same as before. Lots of blood, no bodies. They'’re building a territory, setting up their own perimeter. Like soldiers. More like wolves. Help me... I'’ve got a civilian! I repeat! I got a civilian! He'’s down and needs medic immediately! Wait, no. No, no, no. That doesn'’t make any sense. They wouldn'’t do that. What do you mean? They wouldn'’t have left anyone there. They wouldn'’t have left him alive. You'’ve seen this before? Red Team! Stand down! Back up and stand down! What? I said I'’ve got an injured civilian! No, they'’re luring you in. It'’s a trap! Red Team, fall back! That'’s an order, fall back now! Listen to me. Get out of there now! Too late for that now, Sarge. Red Team, come in! Red Team, do you read me? Nick! Nick! Do you hear me? Damn it! Base, Red Team clear. Not sure what happened, target just stopped its pursuit. Copy that, Red Team. And the civilian? Target took him, snapped the guy'’s neck. Target'’s headed north, I'’m below, Gordon'’s still above. Copy that, Red Team. Gordon, check in. Nick, you good? -Whoa! I got one. I'’m pinned down behind some trash. Weapon'’s out of reach. Gordon, what'’s your twenty? I'’m at the tall building, north of where I left you. Half a click. I'’ll be there. Gordon needs help. He'’s pinned down. Hey, Gordon? Find something to hide your scent. It'’ll be your best chance. I'’m on my way. Nick, take it nice and slow. Stay out of sight and see if you can approach from around the back side. These dinosaurs have excellent hearing, so keep your voice low on comms. Copy that. I'’ve got eyes. I'’m just around the corner. Copy that. On the count of three, we'’ll both jump out and fire. He'’ll be at your twelve. Three, two, one! Damn it. Where'’d it go? See it? Where the hell did it go? It'’s another trap. Are you kidding me? No. It'’s Ozzie. He'’s protecting Harriet. What does that mean? He'’s the male. He'’s leading them away from Harriet to keep her safe. He'’s gonna wait until they'’re further away from her before he attacks again. Red Team, get out of sight immediately! You can'’t see the target, but he sees you. Take cover and wait. The tranqs don'’t work! They'’re bouncing off his skin! Try shooting on the nose. It'’s the softest part of the skin. Now you tell us that? We lost it. It got away. What do you mean, you lost it? I mean we lost it. Target'’s on the move again, headed southeast. Damn it! -Sarge? -Yeah? I never seen anything like that before. Those tranqs might as well have been rock salt. Barely slowed it down. Copy that. Watch your six. Listen up, everyone. We aren'’t dealing with grizzlies here. These are polar bear. I repeat, these are polar bear. Copy that. What does that mean? A grizzly bear will do anything to protect its cub and its territory. But they won'’t actively hunt humans. And a polar bear? A polar bear is the only animal that will actually hunt and eat humans. Blue Team, stay alert. We don'’t know where either target could be hiding. -Copy that. -Copy that. Gordon, which direction did it head? Southeast toward the edge of the perimeter. Can'’t see it. That thing is fast and sneaky. I'’m all set here. Okay. I'’m going hunting. Oh, Nick, try not to get eaten. I'’ll try. Here. This is the midway point between where we saw the broken glass and where Red Team engaged. If one of them headed southeast, this is the spot to cut it off. You'’re the tracker. I thought you were dead, you know. What? Pakistan. I thought they killed you. Is that why you abandoned me there? I didn'’t abandon you. I mourned you. They sent me your dog tags. I didn'’t know a thing that happened for six months. And even then, you didn'’t reach out. I couldn'’t. We had our orders. There was a reason it was a two-person crew, and it was to keep things quiet. We couldn'’t even contact our team. Yeah, but I did and that'’s how I got out of there. They got me out when you left me for dead. Karl? I thought you knew me better than that. I know that you and I made the same mistake that nearly got me wiped out and you thinking for six months that I was dead. You and I got too close. Yes, we did. I'’ll not make that mistake again. And I want my dog tags back! Those were supposed to go to my mother. -You know what-- -Hey! You two knock it off. We'’re not here for this. We'’re here to catch dinosaurs. All right, listen up. Look for the chalk markings on the buildings. X means trip wire, O means motion sensor. Got you. Mind the X. I have a visual. Take the shot, Gordon. Aim for its neck. Softer tissue. Don'’t kill it, sniper! Got it! Oh, please tell me you used tranquilizer. That'’s a negative. I used all my tranqs. Oh, God. Status report now. On our way. They said the tranqs don'’t work. No. They said to shoot it in the nose. Yeah. Maybe I can shoot through the eye with a tranq? You should not get that close. How close is too close? I think my incident at the garbage was a field test. You telling me we don'’t know what it takes to take these down? I mean, it'’s not moving. It'’s probably dead. Plug it a few times just to be sure. What if it'’s playing dead? Would it do that? I'’m not sure I want to get any closer. Not the time to get cold feet, Deacon. We need to bag this thing so we can go home. I'’m going in. No! Deacon! Stay with me, Deacon! Don'’t you leave me, Deacon! Ah! I'’m out of tranqs! Go, go! Deacon! No! Deacon! Deacon! We have to leave him if we'’re going to get them later. Damn it. It'’s V! The mercs are dropping and they'’ve hardly made a dent. Yeah, it'’s happening faster than I thought. She'’s ahead of schedule. Pick up the pace. Yeah, it means she'’s gonna be much more angry and much more protective. All right. Keep me informed. I gotta go. Will do. Bye. As you can see, we'’ve lost our first mercenary. And the current bid, $650 million. I hope you have an underwriter for that. $700 million. What'’s going on? Nothing. What? Your team might not have everything. What do you mean? I mean, there might be a failsafe. Are you kidding me? It isn'’t guaranteed to work. What kind of failsafe? During the embryonic stage, we implanted a microdot, of C4 activated by an electronic receiver. C4, as in explosives? Right. Where? The brain. They have a bomb in the brain? Yes, but that was before they had any real value. Now that we know they can conceive, they'’re worth 10 times the amount that was anticipated. And you were just told to forget about this? Yes. Tell them, or we walk, and you bring in someone else to clean up. Team? -Red Team, go. -Blue Team, go. Simone needs to be told first. Told what first? When were you gonna tell me that they have bombs in their brains? Hopefully, never. They need to know there'’s a failsafe. That was put in before we knew the potential of these creatures. So? Unless absolutely necessary, we don'’t tell them. It'’s too late. Copy that. Bomb in the brain. Well, it doesn'’t matter. We haven'’t tested it. We don'’t even know if it works. There is a password and radio frequency as a last resort. But this is not it. This is not the last resort. Now continue your sweep. Is there anything else I need to know? You didn'’t even need to know that. Screw you and your bank account. Give it to them. Team? Do it and you'’re fired. And you lose your shares, too. Give it to them. Everything I know about you, everything you do, everything you did... What is she talking about? Yeah. Elaine, why don'’t you tell him? -Just tell him. -Shut up. You'’re going to go to jail for a very long time. Listen to me. I don'’t care what you'’ve done. If my people come back alive, I guarantee I will not betray you. If they die and those two creatures running around free, there are thousands of lives on the line. Help me help them. Listen up, team. The frequency to blow the charges is 165.91250. You just signed your own prison sentence. 91250! 250. How do we use it? Well, we don'’t have any way to use in the field. But perhaps I hook up the sonic gun to the radio tower. Yes, this I like. If I can discharge the weapon in just the right frequency, ah, perhaps we set off charges in their heads. You'’re a genius, Karl. Oh, I know. All right, let'’s do this. We think we have a solution. Karl can sync a sonic sidearm to the nearest radio tower. He can then isolate the frequency to match the detonator in the dinosaurs'’ heads. All right. Then let'’s do it. From now on, this is not about retrieval. This is about survival. This is now a search and destroy mission. Nothing has changed. I want them back alive! They never agreed to a suicide mission. You heard me. Use whatever means necessary. Copy that. Let'’s do this. For Deacon. For Deacon! For Deacs. Joy... Let'’s watch some heads explode. Status report. Well, they figured out a way how to hurt them. One of them has a sonic gun. Yeah, they want to blow the charges in their heads. Precautions should have been taken for that! How did they find that out? Elaine gave them the code. This isn'’t good. All right, I'’m going to add a randomizer. The frequency will change every 15 minutes. I should have thought of that in the beginning. The sonic gun seems to hurt them somewhat. Finally some good news. Well, not enough to kill them, though, of course. Enough so they don'’t kill you. All'’s quiet up here. Copy that. Hold your position. Nothing wrong with maintaining the high ground while we make our next move. Have you done a clean sweep of the area? Of course. Why? Stay frosty. There might be someone else around. Like who? I don'’t know. Janitor? Security guard? Homeless? I think they took Deacon this way. What do you got? Nothing yet. Just dog tags. Deacon'’s? No, mine. -Hold on. -What'’s that? It'’s Deacon'’s communicator. It looks like it'’s up again. And... look. It'’s tracking him. Joy, we got the signal from Deacon. It'’s faint, but it'’s alive. You'’re looking at the northeast corner of the ground floor of the largest building right at your 11. -Do you read me? -Gotcha. Proceed with caution. Polar bears. Got it. I'’ve got eyes on Nick. We'’re moving into the basement. Quiet. They'’ve dragged Deacon'’s body into this building. He'’s still alive. There he is. We need to get him out of here. Wait! -We have to do something. -We can'’t let him go like this. -I have an idea, follow me. -Okay. Let'’s go! Nick! Where are you going? I'’m gonna distract him! Ah! Situation report? It'’s a disaster. I'’m going to have to start from scratch. Hurry up. Nick is trapped. Nick, what are you doing? I lost my pack! I'’m engaging the target! With what? With nothing! Does that mean he'’s unarmed? Are you crazy? -Joy, can you engage? -I'’m on my way. Copy. Nick won'’t be able to hold him back for long. Nick! How'’s it coming, Karl? It is taking longer than expected. The circuitry is a mess. Some of the wires are unplugged. It looks like some are ripped out and they'’re missing. I am doing the best I can with what I'’ve got. In case you haven'’t noticed, we'’re getting our asses kicked out here. I'’m on it, I swear! Fine. Keep me posted. Implement Omega Plan. Wait for my signal. Anyone in the control room? Negative. Us neither. It'’s the other one. It'’s eating Deacon. What now? We have to wait. It'’s gone. Tell me it was the male! Tell me you shot the male! We need the female alive! What'’s going on? I need a status report. Talk to me. Joy and I are safe for the moment. That'’s good news. The bad news is even a bullet to the nose will only slow these things down. We'’re in a cargo van in the southwest corner, beaten but able. Copy that. When it'’s clear, get out of there and get back to the tower with the others. We'’ll retreat back to base. Copy that. I'’m not retreating. It'’s only temporary. You heard what Elaine said. They are nocturnal, and they were sedated. Yeah. This is what they'’re like when they'’re weak. Think about that. Jesus. It'’s like watching panthers hunt. They'’re just sitting there, they'’re resting. That'’s why they keep retreating and then coming back. They are gonna wait until night and then they are gonna pick us off one by one. And then they will go where there'’s easier prey to get. And they'’ll eat their way through it. They know what we'’re doing every step of the way. How do they know that? We underestimated them. I'’m out of rounds. Me too. Is it back? Worse. It'’s the other one. How do you know that? '’Cause you shot the other one in the face. What'’s happening out there, Joy? What do you see? We have the female. It is not the male. She'’s just watching us. She is not attacking. She'’s just watching us. I know that sound. I'’ve heard it before. She'’s calling the other one. Joy! Nick! Get out of there now! She'’s calling the other one! They have lured you to where they want you! I repeat, get out now! That'’s a negative. We have no escape. I have a visual on the target. Take the shot. I got you, you son of a bitch. Run! It'’s retreating. Get up here before it comes back. I'’ve only got two rounds left. Unless we can find a magic spot for me to hit, I'’m just about out of options. Over. Copy. Hold your position. Joy, incapacitating the male will hopefully buy us time to come up with our next move. We only have about half an hour to find the female before the male wakes up. The night is coming fast. We made it. We'’re at the tower with Gordon. We'’re okay, awaiting instruction. Copy that. All right, we better move this along. I'’m not doing much with only two shots left to take. We'’re out, too. Is there anything you haven'’t told us that could help us with these things? They'’re smart. We know that. Damn it! Stop! Not just smart. We made them smart. How smart? During the embryo phase when we were experimenting with the prefrontal lobe, we managed to increase the size of the cerebral cortex to that of a human'’s. What does that mean? It means we made him smart, but they exceeded our expectations. We didn'’t count on the fact that they would learn and adapt so quickly. They became highly efficient practically overnight. Efficient at what? This. War, combat. They'’re intelligence grew to the point where they started using complex deception to herd the humans where they wanted them. Those lucky enough to survive the initial onslaught were faced with becoming prey to a highly efficient predator, one without conscience, morals or mercy. The dinosaurs adapted so quickly, they became experts at deception and manipulation almost instantly. In that facility, they became the dominant species. The same thing happened when I tracked it to Deacon. It'’s like they wanted us to go there. It'’s known where we are gonna go or it'’s taken us where they want us to go. Or where they didn'’t want us to go. There'’s more. During the process, the amygdala ended up growing too. What does that mean? It means their fight or flight response is greater than a human'’s. Yeah. Karl, how close are you? I am close. Another minute or two, please. What the hell is going on? Are those mercenaries dead yet? Give me an update! What the hell is taking so long? You told me these dinosaurs were gonna wipe '’em out in no time! Pick up the pace! No. Who is this? Talk. Ah, so you'’re the clever one. These are not just genetically enhanced dinosaurs. They'’ve been bred to be superior soldiers. And now they can breed on their own. When we increased their intelligence, they learned to respond and to react to the most complex battlefield scenarios. Maybe they'’ve become more aggressive. All of the strengths of a lab-developed allosaurus, but with none of psychological problems, or so we hoped. How many laws have you broken doing all this? Laws? People at my level are not subject to the laws of government. Now you and your associates, well, that'’s a completely different story. Is this true? No. I'’m worse than both of them. They'’re just the money. They broker the deals. I made the actual weapons. You knew about all this. You'’ve seen this. All this time, I thought it was you. You'’re just a suit. You'’re a scientist. This is your work. You have no idea. This is my life'’s work! You think I give a damn about them? Please. So we'’ve all been expendable. This was all your plan. No. Not for me. This was not my plan! None of your plans have worked today, but yours have. What are you talking about? That phone call. We were all the field test for your weapons! Wait. What do you mean we'’re the field test? We were only called in because the transport went sour. I found this after the truck crashed and I thought it was Harrison'’s. But he wouldn'’t carry any thing like this. He'’s never dealt with explosives. What is it? This is what is left if a small receiver for an explosion. You blew up their cages and you didn'’t even sedate them. Would you send your soldiers into battle sedated? You son of a-- Sit down! You'’ve got plenty of blood on your hands. You knew about all this. This industrial park? This is all yours. Simone: Yep, we own it. This is all by design. But what if it didn'’t fail? What if you actually succeeded doing all this? It wasn'’t part of the plan. You were always the B team. What does that mean? It means we were never supposed to walk out of here. I'’m guessing a drone strike? We used the same tactic on a decoy mission in Beirut. It didn'’t work out then. At this point, we need to finish the job, or none of us walks away from here alive. I have to check on something. Those dinosaurs could have easily torn us out of that van. I want to know why they didn'’t. I get it now. It'’s where they don'’t want us to be. -Nick, where are you going? -Are you out of your mind? Gordon, you got two rounds left? I need cover. Copy that. You'’re crazy to be out there, amigo. Copy that. The dinosaurs were listening. They have Deacon'’s comm unit. They heard everything we were saying. They know where we were because we told them. That'’s why I thought Deacon was alive. His comm wasn'’t even near his body. They turned it on to lure us to him. This is better than I could have ever imagined. They can understand us? I think I have it! Good, light it up. The dinosaurs are on the move. Karl, just press the button! Activated! It'’s just going to take a few minutes to reach maximum voltage. Copy that. Keep us posted. They'’re here. Don'’t blow the dinosaurs! I repeat, don'’t blow the C4! Why not? Do you even know what'’s in these buildings? No. What? Ammonia Nitrate! It'’s the same stuff that blew the hole in Beirut! If you blow the C4, it will activate the chemical and blow up half the state! Did you know about this? No. Karl, abort! Karl, abort! It was a pleasure working with all of you. Karl! Karl, come in! Did he turn it off? Unsure. I'’ll go check it out! Wait, wait, no, no, no, no, no! What is it? The Oxen Valley plant. It'’s only five miles from here. It'’s in the blast zone. Oxen Valley? It'’s a nuclear power plant. Jeez. Somebody has to get up there and stop that signal before it blows and kills us all! Everybody get that? Randomizer complete in one minute. I'’m on my way. Gordon, I need you to watch my six. They'’re not far behind. Copy that. On it. I'’m on the stairwell! Dinosaurs! Gordon! I need cover! Roger that. Getting into position now. Three, two, one. Frequency randomizer failed. Connection was lost. No! Nick, we'’re almost at 90%! You need to get there now! I'’m looking for a remote override. Hurry, Nick! The targets don'’t seem to be in pursuit. Run, Nick! Come on, Nick. Faster, amigo! I got it! Good job! Karl'’s dead. One of them got him. What about the one on your six? It retreated back towards the van. We got lucky with this one. But I don'’t think Karl messed up. What do you mean? I mean, the setup is perfect. There'’s no reason why it shouldn'’t have worked. We should all be dead right now. The sun is gonna set in less than an hour. We need a new plan. We have another mercenary down. The current bid is $750 million to an undisclosed African nation. $775! Of course, we can deliver within the year. Damn it, Simone! You couldn'’t wait? Contingency? What is this? You don'’t understand. You and I don'’t matter. There'’s too much at stake. The dinosaurs must survive. What did you do? Drone strike. To take out the dinosaurs? No. Us. This just gets better and better. Joy, I think our problem will be solved in the van. Can you get there? To the van? Yeah. What am I looking for? We were in the van they didn'’t attack us because they hid their egg in the van. Joy, I want you in and out of there as fast as possible! These dinosaurs have been one step ahead of us this entire time. It might just be a trap! Joy, I know I don'’t have to tell you how valuable that egg is or what those dinosaurs will do to you if they catch you trying to take it. Copy that. I'’m back in the van. Nick was right. The egg is here. Joy, listen to me. You can'’t fool them twice. They learn. Do you understand? They will kill you. You need to get out of there! What happened to the experiment at Triassic? Were there any survivors? Yes. Two. But every other warm body in the facility was systematically picked off one by one. It wasn'’t just that the dinosaurs got loose and attacked. They planned it. They studied us while we were studying them. They learned our schedules and our protocols. They waited for the right moment to escape. They were always one step ahead of us. They didn'’t just want to get out. They wanted to hunt. They wanted to kill. They could have escaped sooner and never have been caught. But it wasn'’t just about survival for them. It was personal. It was a massacre. That anyone made it out alive was just dumb luck. The fact that two people did is a miracle. The second survivor was a lab assistant. She suffered such trauma from it all, she just disappeared. They say she'’s like a hermit living out in the middle of the woods somewhere. And all she does is talk about revenge against all of us and everything we created. Wouldn'’t you? Several corporations went down in flames and much of it is attributed to her. But it was important for us to keep trying and learn from their mistakes. I see the male! You want this, don'’t you? I don'’t think so. -Gordon? -Got you. Yes! The male is down! I repeat, the male dinosaur is dead! Roger that! Well done, soldier! No! No, you can'’t back out! We have a deal! We have a deal! Oh, come on! Activate Clean Sweep. There'’s no way you'’re going to be able to get out of this. We already killed one of your dinosaurs. It'’s only a matter of time before we gets to the next. That'’s it! You'’re done! Oh, my God! Simone killed Luis! What happened? Simone shot Luis and he killed her before he died! Shit! Shit! Listen, do you know how to turn off the drones? No! Simone was the only one with clearance. I don'’t think I'’m alone. There'’s nowhere to go. I'’m trapped. Nick, put your comm up to the PA system. Go! Hey, dinosaur! I know you can understand me. We have your egg. You know where we are. Come and get it. All right, she'’s on her way. I'’m out of ammo. I'’m no good here. Everything looks good here. The traps are still set up and the explosives are alive and ready. Do you have it? Yeah. Joy? Joy? We'’ve been double-crossed. Luis and Simone are both dead. She killed them both. Gordon, you gotta get out of there. Copy that. Just grabbing some more fire power. I'’m on my way. Give me the egg and this all goes away. Is that why you gave us the wrong frequency? Don'’t make this harder than it has to be. What about the drone strike? Just give me the egg. No. If I'’m gonna die, you'’re gonna die here with me. Nobody wants that. Call off the drone strike! I can'’t do that. I don'’t believe you. Simone wasn'’t leading this operation. You were. Call it off! Damn it. Uh, I stabbed it in the eye. She'’s half blind, she'’s pissed and she'’s coming to you guys! If it gets here, it'’s gonna do everything in its power to protect that egg! And I'’m gonna do everything in my power to make sure it'’s dead! I'’ll still have the female, she'’ll just lay another egg. Not without a male, no. The drone strike will kill it. And thanks to the nuclear power plant, tens of thousands of other innocent people will die including us, if you don'’t call it off... Which is what you want. If both the dinosaurs are dead, the drone strike will be aborted. But you'’ll still have the egg, which is more valuable anyway. Hand over the gun. You know, that'’s the most expensive egg in the world. Let'’s make it worthless. What'’s your ammo situation? Three 9ms. I'’ve got nothing. What are we gonna do? Give me the rest of your ammo. I'’m gonna wait in the safe zone. When that thing finds me, I'’ll destroy the egg and it will want to attack and have to walk through the traps. The explosives will go off, killing it. Wait a minute. And you, too. Wait, are you serious? No! There has to be another way! There'’s no time. I have my katana. This one is bigger and you are wounded and exhausted. There'’s no way you will win head-on. Besides, you need to be the one to get her out of here and deliver her to the cops. We can'’t all these people die today for nothing. People need to know about this. Come on! Let'’s go! Don'’t touch me. I can do it myself, okay? Oh! I know you can hear me, whoever you are. Elaine is dead. We have the egg and your dinosaur is blinded. Your experiment has failed. You'’ll have nothing. You'’re finished. Now, wait a minute. Don'’t be rash. You and I, we can make a deal, just the two of us. I can make you a very, very wealthy woman. I don'’t think so. Don'’t be silly! For God'’s sake... look, you bring me the egg and the dinosaur alive. I swear to God, I will make you one of the richest... richest women... richest people in the world! You don'’t know what kind of money I'’m talking about here. Enough that you don'’t care how many people you kill to get it? If those dinosaurs are dead, the drones don'’t just stop coming! They'’ll be redirected to this building! They'’ll come back here and they'’ll blow it up and a lot of innocent people are gonna die! Don'’t you understand? You'’re lying. It'’s the ultimate failsafe! It'’s designed to keep the technology from getting out if the test fails! Don'’t you get it? The test did fail! You failed! Come on! No! Remember me, you ugly bitch? Take cover! Operation Clean Sweep is complete in Ten... nine, eight, seven, six, five... Oh, God! four, three, two, one. Gordon? Yeah? Are you okay? Oh, yeah. Never better. Good. What now? Think I'’m just gonna watch the sunset. Cool. You gonna lie down?
