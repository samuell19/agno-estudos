THE BOOK OF MARY What do you think? You'll escape routine if you're alone? No, that's not it. But I just can't stand this deal, putting up with anything as long as we stay together. You always come back to that. Admit it you are so afraid of being abandoned, you're fleeing into loneliness. You should know by now. Since you're here for once let's be serious. Seeing you is hardly a blessing now. Even for Mary. It's no good. And I?ve had it. I can't work, I can't sleep. I see, if we separate you'll sleep again? You see how brutal you are? You're brutal too, in your way. You won't face up to things. Listen Paul, you?ve cheated on the contract from the start. You can't brush that off. I think it takes constant inventiveness to succeed. In your line of work, you've lots of time for that. It doesn't interest you, that's all. So we play it safe and stay together. What does that do for the child? Loving's not investing. You can save too, not just give, or expect everything from one person. The way you've set things up, you could talk that way. You're never here. I spent much more time at home. I put a lot in and get little back. We've been over this so often. What other way is there? Before you didn't work, you took care of Mary. But now we're closer to an even footing. I don't agree. I'm still here for serving, caring for things. That's a mother's job, not a woman's. I am tired. Things have got to change for a while. You're so impatient. May be. What I know now is... that I don't need to be dominated to feel understood. I no longer need to lose. I don't see where that gets you either. I don't know. I want to see clearly. I wish you understood. Understanding's scarce. Truth is often deadly. Your truths are fatal, So don't complain afterwards. I'm not complaining, just trying to see clearly. Why is everyone so scared... ...of clarity? Your eyes hurt? No, I'm alright. I don't need your total sincerity. It's comforting, but not interesting. Let's not start again. No, let's not. But try to understand sometimes. For 10 years we've copied. Now I want to invent. No one's stopped you. Anyway, women don't invent much. Even the soul was invented by a man. You're really encouraging. You don't need encouragement now. We can see how well you do on your own. Good morning! We continue with our operation. Now we cut the eye in half. It's black, if you can see that. I put this inside, it's the pupil. The pupil, seen from outside, magnified, of course, is brown. The eye is enormous, but the pupil takes up a lot of space. The rest is water. Water, yes. The pupil floats like a baby in the belly of its mother. When you look at things, it's because of the pupil, because it floats, and when we move as you see, it shifts. Understand what I?m saying? It's complicated, a bit technical. Yes, it's mechanical and technical and at the same time surgical. You operate once for this illness. If you do it twice, the patient dies. In any case the eye withers. It's a very serious operation. Yes, I entirely agree there. You undergo it after you've almost been sick. Because this gentleman, you see his eye, has been completely... shaken, see? It's had a shock. The eye's been completely terrorized, so... we can't do much for it. Well, that's all for this program. Good bye. Spoken to Mary? Not yet, but I'll speak to her, of course. And you'll have to tell her what keeps you so far from her, and from me. You've thought of what it'll mean to her, shuttling between parents? Stop talking as if it was all my doing. Silence, please. My spirit with a heavy fear forebodes In black battalions, stray ghosts ride Driving me on to moving roads closed in by bloodied skies on every side. How strange and wicked was our act? Can you explain my trouble and my fright? Silence! I said, silence! Who can tell me... ...what Baudelaire meant to express in this poem? If you weren't asleep, that is. Get out your notebooks, I'll give you some dictation. Hurry! We have other things to do. My spirit with a heavy fear forebodes... Heavy fear, black battalions, with two "t's", and stray ghosts... Silence! Yes? Mary, I have something to tell you. All right. Go on. And make sure you've made no spelling errors. I have to talk to the principal. I'm sure you know what it is. Dad's going to live elsewhere. Not for a long time. Until winter, for example. Right. To continue: that seek to lead me on shifting ways... Mary! You'll see dad on weekends and holidays. Anyway, it's not for long. Have we committed a strange act? Explain if... It's not that we don't love each other any more. On the contrary. But if he stays here we'll quarrel. There's no cause to worry. I'd tell you if there were. Believe me, you can trust me. Why don't you want us to go to Capri? Because you're an ass. You scare me, Paul. I've arrived earlier than I predicted. Do you need help? Don't just stand there, answer me! No, not necessary. I'll just take two or three things. Won't be long. I'm in a hurry, Mary. You go to Capri, Paul. See you Saturday, OK? Tell me... ...about when I was little. Again! Go ahead. You seem especially fond of hearing that. You're right. It's the strongest memory of love. It's hard to recover that strength without going backward. It is thus. You just have to be able to give and accept. I'll prepare something to eat. See you downstairs. Dry your hair well. Mary! Hello. Hello. What's up? I'm taking a train. Where are you going? To see my father. Doesn't he live here? Not right now. - Your folks divorced? - No, they're not. - Is it your bear? - Yes. In any case... I am glad my parents are not divorced. You have no luck. That's enough. Hello, Mimi. My name's not Mimi, it's Mary. Where you going, Mimi? To see my father. That's right, he's gone away. It's good for him, a little... It's no big deal. Of course not. and you can travel with your bear, so it's no trouble. It's not a bear, it's a panther. Certainly, you're right. I'm a dumbbell about animals, I don't know. And where do you go? Passing the time. I'm on relief. I'm not working these days. I stay at home. I have a lot of housework, I like my place to be clean, you see. - Get bored? - Not at all, because... I study my own case. And I have my afternoons programmed. I go out... ...on my bike, my moped, whatever you want to call it. It takes me everywhere. I get back at 7 or 9 in the evening. If the weather is good, I tike my time, I stop where I please. Forever damned be the feckless dreamer who, in his stupidity, first strove, enamored of an insoluble and sterile problem to mix honesty with love. Have you studied triangles? We've just started. I have to know the 4 types for Monday. Know what a jagged line is? One that changes direction. Yes, but how? By forming angles. And an angle? It's when the lines close. And when they meet? That's the vertex. Also called an intersection. An angle's like this. Yes, but also like this. No, it's like this. To get that, you first need this. All right. There are 4 kinds of triangles. The right-angle triangle, It looks like this. The side opposite the right angle is the hypotenuse. The equilateral triangle is the one that has three equal sides. The isosceles triangle You listening, Mary? The isosceles has two equal sides and the scalene has three unequal sides. Draw them, helps you to remember them. Are you hungry? Yes, terribly. Want a bite? That the concerto I liked so much? Yes, that's the one. Don't recognize it? Oh, yes. No, not really, in fact. Sounds like talk, don't you think? People in a discussion. Agreeing or disagreeing? A bit of both. Changes of mod, icy, exasperated, I demand. fire, fire, attention, error, horror, suffering... Hey, calm down. There's a Mahler symphony I can't find. Ask mom for it next time. OK. Mary, bring your pajamas, too. and don't forget your toothbrush again. We've got to go now. It's time. You ready? What? Mary. Come, Mary. Are you dead or just tired? I am dead. But everything that happens should interest you. You are so curious. You surprise me. It's not like before. Nothing can stay the same. It becomes, It becomes, It becomes different. When a thing stops moving, it's dead. You must have confidence, Mary. Sure, still, it's not like before. In French, Mary is "Marie". Know what it makes? What? A-I-M-E-R : to love. Ah, yes. You're beautiful! Your dress is beautiful! We'll be late. We must be going. The hairdo becomes you. Think so? It's not my favourite. You're darling, really. I'll leave you the number. If something comes up, call. Anyway I won't be home late. Don't forget tomorrow. I get to go out. I haven't forgotten. We should've gone already. I have to go, dear. Don't watch TV too late. I'll kiss you when I come in. Good bye. It would be killing the unification of Europe in the egg. This business must be smothered, in the egg. Can't make an omelet without breaking eggs. So I don't know. I don't know what to say. Get lost! It's the only way.
