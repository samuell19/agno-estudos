They're laughing at your name. So what? Laughing is good. Your elevator is broken. You fat tourists. I could give you idiots authentic Greek items made by my grandmother. But you dummies want this cheap crap. This junk is made in Korea. By prisoners. For you, I'll double the price. And to your guide, a kickback. Twenty Euros. Orgy! I get the tour guide!
