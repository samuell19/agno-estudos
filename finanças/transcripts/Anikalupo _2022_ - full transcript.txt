When someone dies in Yoruba land, they are not buried. Rather, the sacred forest is where the corpse is taken to. When someone dies, it is said that they go to rest. They rest... That is how the dead were buried in Yoruba land, before the turn of time. Times changed and now we dig the ground to bury the dead. The Ifa says that the Akala bird has the power of resurrection. When people die in an untimely way, The mystical Akala bird has the divine ability to resurrect them. But if the person's time is due, then the mystical bird allows them passage to the great beyond. In a verse of Ifa's divination, called the "Idin'osun," A courageous child dressed in the form of Akala, consults the oracle for the King of Oyo and tells him to make a sacrifice so that his palace will not be razed by fire. A disobedient child, is one who hears the flutter of the wings of the dove in flight. The oracle is consulted for Saro, a friend of Elemele. Salagereje. Eventually, the protector becomes the sacrificial lamb. Everyone come around, can you not see the prophecy has been fulfilled?! What is the cause of your death? Young man! You look like you've traveled a long way to come and see the festival. I'm not here for the festival. What festival? And you look so dirty. Well, stay on the right side of the law. - Keep moving along. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Be careful! Our mother. Welcome. Welcome. Be careful. Do you understand? Who is this? Go and get to work. Good day. Who are you? Where do you come from? I'm just a traveler. Good morning. - A traveler? - Yes. I needed a place to lay my head for the night, nothing more. I will leave now. - Don't go anywhere. No, I'm not upset. - Don't be upset. - A traveler... - Yes. In Oyo is not a strange sight. The people of Oyo welcome strangers. Where have you come from? - I am from Gbogan. - Gbogan? Yes. But I have lived in many places, as I seek new markets for my business. Business? What kind of business? - I am a weaver of aso-ofi cloth. - Aso-ofi? Yes. I learned and worked with the best, in the town of Iseyin. - Really? - In fact, I am an expert in this field. - Really? - Yes. Okay then. You are very lucky. And if you prove yourself quickly, you will find fortune here in Oyo. Thank you. - What is your name? - Saro. - Huh? - Saro. My name is Saro. Saro... Saro, the aso-ofi weaver from Gbogan. Yes. Don't go yet. Let me get you some food. Yes. When you finish your food, - you can then move on. - Thank you. - Thank you ma. - No need to mention it. Stand up. You'll go help me buy... Is that what you came here to learn? Huh? Bastard! Your Highness. You summoned me. To be forewarned is to be forearmed. If we fail to prepare, we are preparing to fail. Yes, Your Highness. Our neighbors have started in their usual ways. Which neighbors? When did we conclude on the issue of taxes? That must be the Tapa tribe. - Oyo high chiefs! - Your Highness. Your Highness. Your Highness. Oh Ancient One! Long live the King! I would advise that... everybody goes home, sleep over it and have a rethink. By this time tomorrow, if we go to war or not, we will know. - Let's take our leave. - Your Highness. - Ah! Hairdresser. Welcome. - Good day. Good day to our mothers. - Hairdresser. Good day. - Thank you, ma. - The royal hairdresser. - Thank you, ma. Who have you come to make beautiful today? Queen Arolake sent for me. - All is well with you. - Amen. - Do a good job on her hair. - Yes, ma. - Thank you, ma. - Oh please. Er, Princess Kikelomo! Please go call Queen Arolake. Please sit back down! Which Kikelomo should go and call Queen Arolake? Does my child look like a slave? Everyone knows me in this palace, I don't go past my boundary. I don't dabble into other people's business. Please, for God's sake, if the hairdresser wants to make Queen Arolake's hair and can't go and call her herself, then Queen Arolake should come out. And if she can't come out, she should conceive a child and send them on errands. Failing that, you can send your own children on errands. Yes. Please send your own children on errands. - Queen Arolake! - Princess. Yes? Your hair is really soft. Er... the hairdresser you sent for has arrived. Good. I'm coming. Queen, let us be! Both of you, would die of your jealousy. You were both wedded after me. And someone else will be wedded after you. - Mother, do not shout. - Take it easy, mother. You're more than that. Look, Queen Arolake, you came to this palace. They have their children. I have mine. And you will also have yours. Amen. You won't be barren in this palace. Our mother the soothsayer! It's okay, we shall see. Saro, the aso-ofi weaver from the village of Gbogan. - Is my meal delicious? - Yes. It's good. So, have you thought about what you're going to do now that you're here? Why? No need to think about it. I am going to continue my weaving work. I don't know how to do anything else. I heard you. I know. I know you're an aso-ofi weaver. But I don't see any sign... I don't see signs that you are ready to work. Or do you have money somewhere and you're not telling me? No, I do not have money. Right. I thought so. That's what made me ask you. Er, Saro, why not work here for a while? When you work, you'll make money, you'll save up and then set up your trade. I had hoped to find a weaver here who would be willing to partner with me for a start. Saro, the aso-ofi weaver from Gbogan. How childish. You are very funny. If you accept my suggestion, I can offer you work. When I offer you work, you'll make money. You'll save up. Before you know it, you'll start your own business. By yourself. Is that alright? Alright, no problem. What kind of work is it? - Well done, everyone. - Thank you, ma. - How's the work going? - Very well. - Has the woman come for her pots yet? - She has come for them. - Does she want more? - Yes, she does. - Okay, that's good. - Welcome, ma. - Well done, well done. Is the clay good? - Yes, it's good. Very good. Well done. Thank you. Well done. - We have a visitor. - Great. - Thank you, ma. Well done. - Well done. His name is Saro. Saro... - Yes. He came to join us in our work. - That's good. You'll work together. - Welcome. Welcome to our team. - Thank you. Saro... They say, "Make hay while the sun shines." This is the work. Look here. I know. I know it's hard work. But it's an honest job. You will get paid daily. And food will be provided twice. Daily. Before you start work and before you leave at dusk. Molding clay? Saro... Our friend, look... our work is being shared equally here. If you start a section, and you don't like it, you can join another section. And you'll get paid. We make our money molding clay. - Well done. - Our mother. You see, Saro, it's up to you now. - Good day, ma. - Well done. Queen. Queen Wojuola. Who is it? Queen Arolake, good day. - Please, can... - What is it this time around? I only wanted to ask if I can get my big mirror back now. The mirror that you borrowed some time ago. - Your mirror? - Yes. The mirror I used and gave back to you immediately. You didn't give it to me. Well, as you can see, I don't tie mirrors around my neck or waist. When I return to my chamber, I'll look for it and bring it to you. Do you hear? Some people are not tired of looking only at themselves day and night. You, in this palace? We shall see. - Take it easy. Good night. - Good night. Thank you. - Good night. - Our visitor from Gbogan. I am no one's visitor. - Alright. Good night then. - Good night. Don't stay too long before you head home. You know what they say happens in the market at nightfall. What do they say? If you stay, you'll find out. Hurry! We don't stay late at the market. Ajiun's mother, can't you wait for me? - Your Highness. - Hmm? My dear Wojuola... The one with the sweet voice. The offspring of great musicians. Your Highness. Why did you neglect me? - Me? - Yes. It's been a while since you visited my chamber. You must have noticed something to say this. You're my favorite. Why would I neglect you? I could never neglect you. Don't you know how far we've come? Your Highness, you say I'm your favorite. Yes. Why then is it that whenever we're looking for you in the palace you're always in that girl's... that young girl's room. Your Highness, I wouldn't want to go into details. - Wojuola. - Your Highness. - It is true. - Wojuola. Your Highness. I thought that coming to your chamber tonight would be calming and make me have a sound sleep. I never knew you would bore me with talk. - Look... - Your Highness, please do not misunderstand me. You see, this life is not as hard as you think. Your Highness, please do not misunderstand me. Life cannot be relied upon. There is no love without jealousy, Your Highness. Look, I'm very tired tonight. You're really getting dressed. Your Highness. Your Highness, please stay a little longer. Come back. Please... Look, excuse me please. My dear Arolake. Your Highness, please do not touch me. - Why? - It's not my night. Who told you such? Every night is your night with me. Huh? Come on, come closer. Ah. No, Your Highness. I don't want any trouble. What trouble, Arolake? Who would trouble you? Wait a minute, what have you done to me lady? What have you done to me? Hmm, my dear Arolake? - Look... - We can't do this. What does that mean? Huh? - Okay, it's my time of the month. - That can't be right. Don't come up with that now. Since when? - Hey? - It's really true. I'm not lying. - Really? - It came a little early. I think it's the different fertility herbs I've been taking recently that keeps changing my cycle. - Fertility mixtures? - Yes. Well, if that's it, there are ways around these things. - Don't worry. I know what to do. - Really? - Come on, come close to me. Tsk. - Your Highness. - What is it? - Your Highness, don't behave like those... Excuse me, please. Please, who amongst you bears the name Saro? It's me. Take it. Our mother said I should give it to you. Thank you. - Alright. - Thank you. Hurry up. - What are you people gawking at? - Hey. It baffles me too. Take your own food and be grateful. Will you all eat or not? Here it is. Are you taking it or not? - Come and take it. - Take this. Don't push. - Here it is. Take your meal. - Please, pass it to him. - Where's my own food? - Give us our food. - The food is almost finished. - Give us our food. I want something like his own. - Older Queen. - Younger Queen. - You found it... my mirror. - Yes. The mirror. Such a beauty. Just like you. Thank you for bringing it. You could have sent it through one of the little ones. I wouldn't want them to drop it. I know how valuable it is. Our husband paid a high price for it. The King's favorite glows like the moon. Why is it only you the best gifts are given to? My Queen, you're the King's favorite. The rest of us don't entice him. - Is that so? - Yes. Then why does he abandon my bed only to creep into yours whenever it's my turn with him? Are you surprised how I got to know? You miserable woman. - Witch! Full of hate. - I am not a witch. And even if I were, I would use my powers for better things than luring some old man who... What? Go on, complete your statement. Did I hear you right? The King is just an old lecher to you, isn't he? A King who rules over all means nothing to you anymore? Please, my senior, do not misunderstand me. You see, I don't know what you heard. Believe me, I did not entertain the King out of turn. That's alright. You don't have to beg. Don't bother saying anything. We all have our uses here in this palace. For some of us... are you listening? We are to bear royal sons and daughters. But you... you have a different use. You're just for the King's pleasure. Oh yes! You're useful for nothing else. This is a warning. Listen carefully. The next time it is my turn for the King to be with and he goes missing and I find out he's in your chamber... I'll deal with you. Senior Queen. Please, my mirror. Take your mirror. Faster. Our friend from Gbogan! Good morning. She's a married woman, you know? Who? Aw a run. Aw a run has the form of a woman, but she is really a man. Why are you telling me this? It is my duty to tell you. You are a newcomer in these parts and you are young. In fact, I would have said you're stupid but I do not want to insult your maker. Aw a run... Seven years ago, she simply packed her things and left her husband's house. You are not the first. Yes... All the men working for her were once her lover. This is your time. Okay? Does anyone around here know about me and her? That, I don't know. Most people around here do not gossip. They mind their own business. - Oh really? - Yes. But not you, right? Really? It's not your fault. It's really not your fault. I blame it on my conscience that compels me to tell you the truth. The woman you're involved with is a man-eater. Are you listening? She loves young, good looking men like you. She sleeps with them, and turns them into slaves. Keep quiet! What nonsense are you saying?! It's not your fault. Okay? I've done my part. Keep at it. Hmm? Come on, hurry up! Hey! Here she comes. Roaming heedlessly like a sheep. - Here she is. - Pick them properly. - Ah, shame. Started acting up. - Take it easy. What?! What?! Denike! Anike! Haven't I warned you not to go close to her again? - Take it easy! - Come on, leave this place. Go sleep if you have nothing to do. Get inside! Can you imagine, ma? You really have to calm down. Her beads scattered and they are helping her pick them up. Is it a crime to help? Why did you beat innocent children? What is it? Excuse me ma. Everyone in this palace, knows me. I do not cross my boundaries. And I do not poke my nose into people's affairs. What is it? Why should my children help her pick her beads? Are they her slaves? Who says this a matter of slavery? Her beads scattered on the ground. Have your children sinned by helping her pick them up? - You really do need to calm down. - So what if her beads scattered? So what if her beads scattered? Clearly her hands are hurting her You know the beads are too heavy for her hands, she can't carry them herself. Please, my dear, hope nothing is wrong with you? I didn't cause her not to have a child to send on errands. Please. Hypocrite. - Your Royal Highness. - Who is it? Your Royal Highness, it's me Ogunjimi, your servant. Come in. Your Royal Highness. - I hope there's no problem? - Your highness, Queen Arolake is feverish. - Arolake is feverish? - Yes, Your Highness. - What kind of fever is it? - I do not understand it myself either. Arolake. Why don't you let me... What is wrong with you? My wife, Arolake. What is it? Arolake... You're deceitful. Come on, let's go. I'll wake up and bathe and be fashionable I'll wake up and bathe and be fashionable I'll wake up and bathe and be fashionable I'll wake up and bathe and be fashionable Me, Saro Me Saro, I will bathe Even more than the women I'll wake up and bathe and be fashionable - Good day. How's it going? - Welcome. - Good day sir. - Welcome. Good day. - Are you Saro the aso-ofi weaver? - Yes, of course! Aw a run told us we will get very good aso-ofi from you. Yes, let me show you some of them. Yes. - Here they are. - Let me see. Here they are. Isn't this good? Are you out of your mind? It's very beautiful, mother. Queen Arolake, I have come to give you your herbs. Who is that? Come in and show yourself. Who are you? I have never seen you in the palace before. I am new in the palace. The herbs were delivered to the kitchen and I was sent to give them to you. How about Doja? Where is he? I have no idea. I was only sent to bring this to you. Okay, then. Thank you. Wait. Come take the calabash back with you to the kitchen. This hairstyle looks good on you. - I know it's what you love. - Yes, that is very good. - Akano Erin. - Yes? - Yes this is really me. - You've really changed. - So I'm getting bald? - Yes you are. Don't you know it means wealth when the head gets bald? - Really? - Yes, wealth is for us. Who goes there?! - Where? - Someone is here. Who is there? Be very careful, please. Where did you see him? Who are you? Can you hear? Please be careful. Will you take the torch? Yes. Take it easy. - Do you see anything? - No, I can't see anything. - Then it's the breeze. - That's good, then. Drop the torch and come in. Come in, time is running out. - Aw a run! - Yes that's me. I said come in. - Alright. - Okay, go in. Boss. - Won't you sing for us today? - Entertain us with your music. Are you both alright? I should entertain you with my music? Have you finished your tasks? Running your mouth uselessly. Just finish the work I gave you, come and arrange this stuff by my legs. I should entertain you guys. Good afternoon. A lot of work is going on here. - Welcome, mother. - Mother. You both will succeed. - I hope you all are well. - Yes, mother. Babarinsa, hope your mother is well. She is well, thank you. - She's healthy? - Yes, she is. Very good. Adigun? I see you too. Well done. Take care. Saro? Don't I deserve your greetings? I greet you, welcome. Babarinsa... Come. Come. - Adigun. - Ma? Come over too. Come this way. Go to the Kolanut seller and get me some. Hurry back. Don't stay long. What's wrong? I'm talking to you. Who were you with last night? Who was that man? Saro. So it was you. So, that was you creeping around my window last night? You're such a fool. Saro. How dare you open your dirty mouth to question me? - You? I said it. Yes, of course. - Me? - I said it. - Dirty mouth? Saro. It wasn't a mistake. I meant what I said. That's right. Look at me. Not only is it that you have a dirty mouth... it also stinks. Your mouth smells. It's rotten. Yes, I tell you. Look at me properly. Whatever I do, no one questions me. I can also do whatever I like with anyone I please. And no one dares question me. Wait a minute, Saro. Did I tell you that I need a husband? Or did I ask you to help out? Which of them did I do? Ah, Saro. Do not bite off more than you can chew. You hear me? Tread carefully and face your work. The woman you're involved with is a man-eater. Are you listening? She loves young, good-looking men like you. She sleeps with them and then turn them into slaves. I greet you all Oyo high chiefs. Your Royal Highness. This empire will not be destroyed. - Amen. - Amen. Akiniku has just said something important about the slave traders. Wait, where exactly are we headed? Your Highness. - The King with the beautiful beads. - Thank you. - Your reign will endure. - Amen. Your Highness. I greet all Oyo high chiefs. - Our mothers, you shall live long. - Amen. As soon as I heard that they were coming, I came to tell the King. But before I told him, I had already positioned armed men in all the nooks and crannies of the village. Where there were two men, there are now four. - Well done. - Well done. Where there were ten men, there are now 20. They've all been multiplied. I don't know anywhere else they would pass through to come and enslave the people of Oyo. - Let's see. - You're a strong man. Well done, achiever. Your Highness. Your reign shall last. - You shall live long. - Amen. We've been trading in this village for a long time. Anyone can work hard and earn their reward. They can build a house, marry and then have children. Then take care of the children. When it's time for the father to rest, at an old age and enjoy the fruit of his labor. They then lure the children and sell them off to slavery. Have you ever seen an enslaved child go back to their village? - None. - None. So please let's take it easy. Slavery isn't good. Do not for once give it a chance. Do not take any chances. Please, let us not complicate simple things. How? Why is it that we always go ahead of ourselves? Why? Those coming, the white people that said they would partner with us... Why don't we just listen to them to hear what business they want to partner with us for? Isn't it the white people that are coming? Don't go there. Don't even think about it. Why would you even say something like that? Do you mean children that would be useful for us in the future, should they be sold off? Come on! Look, I'm getting scared already. I'm scared already. Let's be wary. So no one would expose us to our enemies. That's how it would be. Let's be careful. - Baba Oloye... - Slave trade is of no advantage to us. Do not repeat what you've just said. It's the wrong end of the stick. Slave trade is just an official way of kidnapping. Do you think anyone sold into slavery ever comes back home? - They never return. They're taken forever. - Such a person is forever gone. Your Highness. We live amongst the villagers. We see and know everything. There's nothing happening in this village that is news to us. Everything is clear to us. We can assure you that, by the grace of God, you shall live long on your throne. - Amen. - Amen. Oyo high chiefs. Your Royal Highness. Saro... I'm begging you. How long would I beg you before you forgive me, Saro. Saro. Do you want to marry me? Saro. Don't do that. Even if I decide to marry again, ah, Saro, it's not someone like you. I can't marry you. Take a look at me, Saro. You are too young for me. You can't marry me. Saro, please. I wish for you a woman... that'll love you, respect you, take care of you, treat you like a king, and bear you children. That is the kind of woman I wish for you. Saro, when that time comes, you will have my blessing. Do you hear me? I'll support you. I'll also give you my all. You hear me? But then, let nothing come between us. Do you hear me? Come on, hug me. Let go of your moodiness. Don't be like that. Saro... I have good news for you. I have really good news for you. I learned that the king's wives and other royal women are in need of new clothes. Yes. So I recommended you for the job. - Honestly? - Yes, honestly. That... I, Saro, would make new clothes for the King's wives. You are expected tomorrow at the palace. - I could be on my way immediately. - Come on! How come? Let's make love until tomorrow. You're expected tomorrow. - I, Saro... - Yes, you Saro. Come on. -The son of Tewogbola will make aso-ofi -Yes. - For the royal household? - Yes. - Ah, Aw a run. Ah, Aw a run. Ah. - Come on. Yes? - Welcome, Queen. - Well done. Trust all is well. Welcome. - Did you come with the best ones? - Look at these choices, Mother. - Yes, of course. - Good day. - Nothing shall happen to you. - Amen. Young man. - You're said to have the best of clothes. - Yes, of course. Ok, let's check them out. They're good indeed. - This isn't colorful. - It's really not bad. - Do you have another design? - These are the aso-ofi here. - Give her that design. - They are many. There are many of them. - Oh yes! - This one is good. What do you think? - Do you still have this design? - Yes, it's available. Mother, is that your choice? What exactly is the problem? Why can't I wear it? It would look so attractive. Bring the princess's own. - Do you like this one? - This is good. This would really look beautiful on you. Take them. Alright. Keep this for me, okay? What about the other royal children? They would be dressed accordingly. Meanwhile, keep this for me. Do you hear me? Keep this for me. - We too would pick these ones. - We would pick these ones. The princess will take this one. Yes. It's for the princess. That's good. - Thank you very much. - Thank you. Thank you. Please don't mix them up. Please. Thank you. That is the one our mother picked, the other one is the one we picked May God have mercy on you. Children of the king, good day. Take it easy. Young man, there is one more Queen. - You wait here and I'll go and get her. - Alright. Whoever is following me, man or beast, show yourself! Queen! - My mother. - Yes, I'm listening. I'm so happy about the clothes we're about to buy. Didn't you see how good-looking the man is? Just like the fabrics he brought. They all look so beautiful. It was so difficult to choose. He's so handsome, mother. Just say you like the man. - Mother... - Keep quiet. That's not what I said. Am I lying against you? Mother, is it because I said his clothes are very good? Mother. Oh please. Don't you know, I gave birth to you. No matter how old you are, I'll always be your mother. Do you think I didn't see you? I saw both of you looking at each other romantically. I was not looking at him romantically. Maybe he was looking at me, I don't know. But then I, Omowunmi Ayanladun Omofadeke, I wasn't looking at him romantically. Continue deceiving yourself. Truth be told, he is so handsome. I wonder if he's married. So who would confirm that for us now? - My mother. - Yes? I think I want to change some of my choices. Can you have him come back so that I can look at the designs again? And then pick another. Of course, why not? - Is that all. - Thank you, my mother. Where have you been? You scared me. Saro. Where are you coming from? Why are you questioning me? Do I ask you where you go? Well... I stopped to see some friends. Really? Saro. You are lying. You don't have any friends. Since when do you have friends? I have many friends. - Oh really? - Yes. Let me tell you, my friends are many. - Really? - Yes. Very good then. Queen Arolake. - Who is it? - It's Omowunmi. Come in. Princess Omowunmi. Are you here to steal my beads? Not at all. I came to drag you out of your room where you hide every day. Listen, how come you don't come outside to get some sun into your skin? So your skin can glow more? I don't really like the sun. I like the moon better. The moon is a gentle lover. I don't know about such things. Soon enough, you'll understand. Wait till your father finds you a man, a handsome prince. Not on my life! No one is going to choose a husband for me. I will choose for myself. Okay. That is good. Here. Ah, for me? Thank you. I'm grateful. It's so lovely. I keep making them but I can't sell them. And I certainly can't wear them all. Maybe some of the other princesses may like to have them too. You have a point there. Do you have interest in any young man at the moment? When last exactly did you see any handsome man, any eligible man at the palace? Apart from the aso-ofi weaver that came the other day. - You like him? - No, not at all. I'm just saying he is at least interesting and handsome. He is even coming to the palace this evening. I want to look at those designs again and choose more carefully this time. Really? But you said you don't have eye for any man. The fabric or the fabric maker? You're a jester. Be gentle with my legs! So you really haven't found anyone you like yet? These ones are beautiful. I'm thinking about adding them to the former ones I picked. Queen! Queen! Queen. Where did she go? Queen. Where were you? I was looking for you. Er... Tsk. I only went out for some fresh air in the moonlight. Remember I told you the moon is my secret lover. So what did you want to see me for? - Nothing. It's past now. - Okay. - Goodnight. - Goodnight, friend. - Take care. - See you tomorrow. - Well done. - Welcome. Saro. You have the right to be mad at me... Saro. Who is mad at you? Please, I'm pleading. I don't know what made me behave like that towards you. I said, who is mad at you? Definitely not me. Then why have you stayed away from me? Even if we quarrel, should we stay apart for so long? I mean it, I'm not mad at you. I'm only scared for you. Because, you're taking on more than you can handle. Saro... you've been taking something that is not yours. - That's all. - Is that so? What do you mean? I am telling you this because I don't want you in trouble. Saro, I warn you. Please, kindly take your leave. Calm down. Don't say anything, I'm begging you. At least I'm here already. Let's enjoy the moment. How do you manage to come and go without being seen? Like a snake, I can slither in and out of anywhere I want to without being caught. Okay, I'm sorry. My personal bodyguard covers for me. What? What did you say? Your guard knows you come to see me? - At this time? - Not at all. I tell him I'm going to see my mother. We left the palace together, but we didn't get here together. I gave him some money and told him to go enjoy himself, then I came here. Saro, I know... I'm scared too, but then, I was missing you and had to see you. So one can be this happy. This is the closest to happiness I have ever been. Yes, I came to thank you. Everything has been going on fine and well. I'm calm and happy. Thank you. Thanks to God Almighty. You're welcome. - That's how it ought to be. - Exactly, Your Highness. If there's to be conflict within the community, it's the duty of the King to settle the matter. I was only 15 when I was married off to the king. Isn't this Arolake, the child of yesterday? The exact one, she's the one. - She's all grown now. - Your Highness. - I could take her as wife, right? - Ah, Your Royal Highness... Ah, I'll do what the King wants. I tried to kill myself. But I wasn't successful. I felt so trapped, like someone in a permanent jail. I am so angry, and I am so sad. I have known nothing but hatred from the other Queens. Recently... - Someone tried to poison me. - What? Poison? Arolake, you must not die! You must not die. Drink some out of it. Even if it's a bit. Well done. Alright, vomit it. Alright. You mean you went through all that? I've also been through a lot in my life... Saro! I was only six when I was taken away - to work off my parent's debt. - Come on, let's go! Coming to Oyo was the turning point for me. I've been able to make profit from my hard work here. So I've decided, it's either I make it here... or I die while hustling. One must happen. Your labor will not be in vain. Oyo has been kind to you. Oyo has been kind to me, indeed. But... the day I set my eyes on you was the day I said to myself that, if this kind of beauty could belong to me... only death would separate us. - Honestly? - Indeed. - Saro... - Hm? Let's run away. What did you say? You and I, let's pack our things and leave town, right now! Come on, no. Saro, don't be scared. We can do this. Do you know what you're saying? We should run away? To where? Anywhere but here. Look, I know where the King keeps his money and his treasures. I can hurry to the palace and take something substantial for our journey. I don't support this. If the King discovers... Saro, calm down and listen to me. There is no way I'm going back to that horrible life. Not after all I've heard from you tonight. I'm certain destiny has brought us together. And we can make it together. Saro... I am telling you this because I don't want you in trouble. Saro, I warn you. Arolake, Arolake, let's elope. Yes. But it has to be tonight. I will hurry to the palace to get my things. - Arolake! Arolake! - What is it? Don't make them suspicious. I'll be packing my things here. Princess Omowunmi. What's the matter? Hope there's no problem? What is it? Where are you coming from? I... I went outside for some air. Your lover. What did you say? Your lover, the moon. "The moon is a gentle lover", you said. Oh, I didn't know that's what you were referring to. Don't pay attention to some of the rubbish I say sometimes. Just tell me what's the matter? I said where you're coming from? I already told you. I said I went to get some air. Liar! My mother was right. You're a whore! Husband snatcher! Omowunmi. 'Mowunmi. My mother! My mother! Omowunmi! - What happened? - My mother! - What happened? - My mother! Speak up, I'm listening. What happened? - What did I do? - You're wanted at the palace. Saro the betrayer! Saro. What a pity. People of Oyo. Your Royal Highness. Oyo high chiefs. - Your Royal Highness. - Your Highness. This is a betrayer. Oyo welcomes everyone from far and wide. Oh yes. We did welcome you. And you had the guts to pierce the eye of Oyo with a sharp stick. Not even a king dares try this with me. But you, a stranger had the guts to. Oh yes. Who sired you? - A king does not suggest. - Yes. - A king decrees. - Yes. - You guards... - Your Highness. Take this criminal, and treat him accordingly. Long live the king. Saro the betrayer! Saro the betrayer! - Saro the betrayer! - Beat him! You're such a betrayer! Betrayer! You're such a betrayer! Betrayer! You're a betrayer. Anyone who betrays must be killed. Betrayer. You're a betrayer. Betrayer. Useless betrayer. Since you want to be a betrayer. Saro. Saro. Sorry. I'm sorry. Please let's leave. They're gone. Let's leave. Saro. Look at me. Saro. Let's go. Please stand. Saro. Saro. Saro. Saro. Saro! Saro... Arise, mortal. You don't deserve to be alive. Go back to your death. Sorry. Stand up. Let's go. Sorry. - Arolake... - Yes? I'm tired. Please, let's sit over there. Let's sit there. I'm feeling so drowsy. - I feel pain all over my body. - Sorry. Here, please. I can't go any further. Take it easy. Sit. Sit here. I am tired. I can't go any further. I just hope we don't die here in this forest. Saro. My entire body hurts. I am so hungry. We should have just stayed and been killed. Arolake, don't think in such a manner. Don't think that way. Sit here and wait for me. Let me go check if I'll find for anything we can eat nearby. Where? Where are you going to find something for us to eat? Let me check the surroundings first. Maybe we will see something to eat. I can't stay alone here. What if you miss your way and can't come back to me? I won't go far, I won't get lost. I'm coming. You just relax. You hear? I'm coming. - Saro. - Yes, Arolake. Please do not abandon me. I can't abandon you, Arolake. I can't leave you, no matter what. I'm coming. Just keep resting, I'm coming. Food. Pele. Where did you find pawpaw? - Close by. - Thank you. Bring yours. Mine looks softer than yours. Let me help you peel yours. You can't peel it. This one is hard. What did you hide when I was coming? Nothing, I didn't hide anything. You'll eat it gently. - What did you say? - Do not eat... the thing... inside. The seed. Hey! A river! Take it easy. Take it easy. Don't fall. Don't fall. - Let me help you out. - Thank you. Alright. Here. Don't make me fall. Arolake, let's keep moving. Let's just forge ahead. I'm sure we'll get to a town soon. Isn't this a cassava farm? - Good day, travelers. - Sir. - Good day. - Sir. Where are you going? Where have you come from? We are glad to see you. Please is there a village nearby? Ojumo Village isn't far. But if you keep walking on foot, you won't get to Ojumo before dark. We have no choice. We'll keep walking on foot. Okay. You travelers, hear this before you take your leave. They say obedience is better than sacrifice. If you can find your way, I'm fine with that. But I want you to understand this, this road is plagued with slave traders. There are very many of them. If you continue, the both of you will surely get captured and enslaved. Sir, please what do we do now? The thing is... I have a hut in the forest where I stay when I hunt late into the night. If you like, you can come along with me and sleep there. And by tomorrow morning you can head to Ojumo village. No. I can't return into that evil forest. Hold on. Who are you both? What are your names and where are you from? - Sir, please. - Huh? Let's just say we've come from a far place. It's very far. Please. We're going to the village - Please, sir. - Good. Please. If you want to, follow me to my hut in the forest. If you like you can go. You'll be turned to slaves. War is upon us and has nowhere to go. There are consequences for every action. Whatever sacrifices they make would not succeed. Greetings, travelers. - What's your name? - Saro. - Saro is your name? - Saro. Saro is my name. - And your wife? - It's Arolake, sir. Arolake. Take this from me. Look. You can relax. Here's a seat. Do not be scared. I want to go hunting. But I'm not going far away. Er... If you're really tired, and you feel sleepy, you can go in, to the hut. And if you want to ease yourself you go into the forest. This is a pot, there's water in it. You can roast yam to eat. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Don't be scared. - Thank you. He who fights and runs away lives longer. The warrior that dies has lost everything. I am like a small leaf that cannot be used to wrap corn meal. Good day. - Welcome, hunter. - Greetings. - Good day, sir. - Good day. - Welcome from your trip. - Thank you. Thank you. - Ogun reigns. - Ogun reigns, he reigns. Thank you. - May our day be fruitful. - Amen. We are home. If you like, you can decide to stay with us. My house is your house. If you prefer, you can continue your journey. - All roads are clear for you. - My child... Akin! Have mercy! Have mercy! Akin! What's wrong? Why the wailing? Excuse me! - Sorry. - Ah, Akin, our dear child. Mopelola. They brought him from Oluyolu wailing all the way. This can't be! Akin. Akin, my child. This can't be! Akin! Akin! Get up and look at me. Akin, I ask you to rise and stand! Oh Akin! - Ah, what a pity. - Akin! - Akin is gone? - He's gone. Do I really deserve this? - No, not you. - Not you at all. Oh death, you have arrived When we're born Our destiny is supposed to... Akin has died, Akin has died - Saro. - Yes? What is it? Our lives are about to change. How? Remember I told you I saw how the mystical bird brought you to life? Yes. - Take this. - What is this?! Don't shout. Akala's power. Akala's power? This is what it used to bring you back from the dead. When I chased the bird away from you, this dropped. And I picked it up. Here, take it. No. Why should I collect it from you? Saro. Listen to me. Now is not the time to be afraid. I never wanted to tell you. I was waiting for the right time. And here it is. - Take it and be a man. - I can't touch it. Don't you understand yet? This is power. A very great mystical one at that. This power will change our lives. And I believe God blessed us with it. Just imagine, what do you think will happen if the world knows you have the power to raise the dead? Akin is gone! Oh my God! Who will console me? Who will console me? Who will console me? Akin, stand up. Akin, stand up! Oh Lord! I should accept this? Arise! - Help! - Help! - Help me! - What is this? My darling... Akin! Akin. Akin. Visitor. I don't know how you did it. I never knew any man existed on earth created by God gifted with the power to resurrect. Yes. Welcome. - Let's just be thankful. - We thank God. - I thank you both. - We thank you. I thank you. - You both won't weep over your children. - Amen. - Alright. - Thank you. Look, visitors... This is palm wine. When you're done eating, you top it up with this. We tap only the rich palm wine here. The wine from the oil palm. We cherish the one that grows by the lake. Good day, hunter. The King's mouth piece. We hear you host a resurrect or. Er... yes, King's mouthpiece. He's summoned by the palace. - Hope there's no problem? - No problem. Okay then. We'll follow you once he's done eating. No. Just him. Or do you now raise the dead? No. Get up. I am the King's mouthpiece. Anything I say is from the king. When we get to the palace, bow down, and answer all questions clearly. Understood? Stand up. Hurry up. You, relax and keep eating. Relax. Anikulapo is with us We can't be scared of death Anikulapo is with us We can't be scared of death Anikulapo is with us We can't be scared of death Anikulapo is with us We can't be scared of death - Your Royal Highness. - Welcome. - The King greets you. - Thank you. Are you the man called Anikulapo? Look, our friend, speak up so the King can hear you well. My name is not Anikulapo, great king. So what is your name? And where are you from? Saro is my name, Your Highness. And I am from Gbogan. Gbogan... Gbogan... You are far from home. Yes. I have traveled through many lands. I am only passing through your land, King. So, you really did raise that boy to life? Yes. In the presence of many witnesses. And you can do it again? May death be far from us, great king. - Amen. - Amen. But there's nothing God cannot do. Please, our friend. And where, pray tell, did you get this kind of power? It's the truth. We were all scared. I've only heard it in stories that the dead can be resurrected. But for witnesses to testify that someone resurrected the dead, you are the first. I don't know any man, dead or alive, who has this kind of great power you possess. Even though I'm yet to witness it. But then, I want to encourage you to spend some time with us. Er... Live with us. Be friends with us. We love visitors. Isn't that right? That's the truth. We love and welcome people. Look, There's nothing you bring into our village that we don't accept. And you shall not be ashamed. - Thank you. - Your Royal Highness. Please I will like to suggest... that we inform the chief priest Fakunle of this latest happening immediately. Thank you, Your Highness. Thank you. Thank you. Listen, what does the King look like? They say he is dumb. Come on. Arolake. He is not dumb. I heard he has a mouthpiece. Yes. What I heard is that, it is an abomination for him to speak in public. He also speaks to the chief priest during rites and propitiation. Then why doesn't he speak publicly? Or was it an heavenly judgement? Let me not lie, I do not understand it either. Some people say... he swore an oath a few years ago exchanging his tongue for power in order to conquer his enemies. Some people also say, he spoke last when he saw his father being slaughtered like an animal during a war. What a pity. That's so bad. But only God knows which is true or false. Who knows? My guardian. We are now successful. Here it is. So what next? - Now we just live. - Yes. - In happiness. - Yes. And joy. So what next? It's the truth. Yes. However, I'm thinking about work. - Work? - Yes. What will we eat? We will starve. Saro. We can never starve again. - Don't you understand? - Help me understand. Explain it to me. Will I spend all my time raising the dead? Or will I ask people to give me food in exchange for raising their dead? - I'm only asking. - Saro, the aso-ofi weaver. - My love. - My love. - My wife. - Be patient. A patient dog eats the fattest bone. I'm patient but I can not see any job prospects. Anikulapo! Anikulapo! Please, save us. - Anikulapo! - Anikulapo! - Drop him. - Anikulapo! Help us, please. Anikulapo! - Saro! - Yes? Wake up. You are being called outside. - Anikulapo! Anikulapo, save us! - Who... Who is that? Anikulapo, save us! Please. Please, save us. Save us! Help me. Look, please stop crying. God will make him succeed. Amen. Akano's mother. Help me! - Look at your child. - Help me. Help me! Arise! Thank you. We're grateful to you. - We're grateful. Thank you. - Thank you. - We're grateful. - Thank you. We thank God. - Okay, stand up. Rise. - Leave her. Anikulapo performs wonders in our village We've come to thank you Anikulapo performs wonders in our village We've come to thank you Anikulapo performs wonders in our village We've come to thank you Anikulapo performs wonders in our village We've come to thank you Arise! What?! Anikulapo, I'm grateful! My brother. Akanmu. Oh, thank you. My mother. My mother. - Thank you, Lord. - Grandmother. - What is it? - Lord, thank you. I told you to let me rest in peace. - My mother, please don't go yet. - Don't go yet. - What exactly is it? - Don't go. Who exactly asked for your help? - How many are left? - About six more. Yes. It's exactly six. Or should I make it four? - Please make it fast. - I'm sorry. Good day. Welcome. Your Royal Highness. Wisemen of our town, I greet you all. As we all know, two heads are better than one. It is about the strange man who came to our village and calls himself a resurrect or, Anikulapo is what I want us to discuss. Because if I give a dog advice and he doesn't listen, the dog will be shot. A ram that doesn't listen will be lost to someone's sacrifice. Any person who I give advice to that doesn't take it, leave him alone to do what he pleases. He will reap the fruits of his deed. It was divined that when Orunmila was going to learn how to swim from Olokun, he spent at least four years learning preliminaries, another six months in the next stage. He spent another 16 years learning to swim in the rippling waves of the ocean, struggling despite the dangers. Can you not see the fire of repercussion is burning? Let us allow him to leave. Sir. Sir. Please tell me, what has Anikulapo done to offend you that made you come report him at the palace and also decide that we send him away? Why do you want him sent away? Stop calling him Anikulapo. He is Anikulapo! Does he have death in his pocket? Or does he control death? Someone who will die soon. Otun, don't you understand? Don't you know why this man acts this way? - Oh please. - He is just jealous, that's all. - It's jealousy, alright. - Me? - It's jealousy. - You're jealous of him. - My goodness. - With all the power you possess? At your age chief priest, you then recited such a long and winding divination chant because of this little matter. Come on! You're just being an hypocrite. What is the worst thing he has done? We don't understand. Please think of the future. Because everything you do, will be recorded in history. Chiefs, let us be patient. You know chief priest Fakunle sees beyond all. What he has said might actually be the truth. They say I'm jealous. Jealous of whom? When did I become so useless to you all? Er... Everyone, Chief priest Fakunle, the other chiefs don't mean to humiliate you. They're trying their best to understand you properly. We all know the kind of person Anikulapo is. Also, all he has done in this village and in the neighboring villages. Does he do it for free? After all, he gets paid for it. He is just so free within the village. You don't know where he came from. You don't know the source of his power. Tell him to bring the gourd so we can examine it. - Omowon! - I'm coming! - My eyes. - What's wrong? - What happened? - Omowon. Something fell into my eye. Please blow it out. Come closer. Closer. Come closer! Blow it out. Ah. My eyes. - I can't see. Can't you blow it properly? - I've blown it. Okay. Don't rub it. Don't... Oh no! Welcome. Your Royal Highness. - The King greets you. - The King greets you. Thank you. Thank you. It seems like... Thank you. Anikulapo, the King greets you. No one can deny the greatness and extent of your contribution in this village and our neighboring villages. - Yes. - Thank you. The King blesses you. Amen, amen. However, we are bothered... and seek to understand in detail what kind of power you possess and its source. My power is from God. - Your Highness. - That's all. It is true. Everyone knows that God is powerful. This power you use, did you learn it? Or you inherited it? What the chief priest wants you to make us understand is, what is the real source of your power? Have I committed any offense? No, not at all. You didn't offend anybody. With all of your good deeds. I feel attacked by you all. Attacked? Do not think that at all. No one is attacking you. In fact, we love you in this village. And we see all you do in this village, and our neighboring villages. It is said that when two initiates meet, they exchange coded greetings. Do you understand? He just wants to know, the source of your power in full details. And that there won't be any dire consequences for this village and our neighbors in the future. - That's all. - Nothing more than that. You've offended no one. You've offended no one. - No one can say you've offended them. - Let's not beat around the bush. I do not have to tell anyone the source of my power. I won't say it. Surrender the gourd to us. Would it work if anyone else tries to use it? Wait a minute... Not at all. Really? Why should I do that? When I'm not possessed. Possessed? Chief priest, would you surrender your power to someone else? Anikulapo, this matter isn't so serious. We are just being curious. The chief priest only wants to examine your gourd to know if the power is harmful to the people of Ojumo. If you want me to leave your village, I will leave. - It's not like that. - I thought as much. But for me to surrender the gourd to you, it's not possible. If anyone aside from me Saro Tewogbola, touches the gourd, such a person is ready to die untimely. Lord, do not let us die untimely. He will just leave. -Your Highness -He speaks the truth. - Your Highness, it's the truth. - He speaks the truth. Did you hear it? - He is leaving already. - We can't let him. - He is leaving already. - Call him back. He's leaving. - Has he made any sense? - You are too mean. Hey. Hey. Omowon, hey! Stand up. What's the matter with you? What's wrong? You are pregnant. What? Don't you know you're pregnant? It's not a problem. Whoever is responsible needs to know, and take responsibility. Right? Can't you speak up? Good day. Welcome. You've been gone long. Thank you. What is going on here? Nothing. This doesn't look like nothing. What's wrong with her? What did you do? Speak up! - She's pregnant. - What? - Omowon. - Yes? You're pregnant? Really? - Saro... - Yes? What have you done now? Ma, forgive me please. Please ma, please forgive me. Omowon, you can take your leave. Arolake. Please don't take this to heart. It's not a big deal. It's not a big deal? Saro? It's not a big deal? Arolake. We ought to have had this conversation. And I guess it's time we did. It's true. I impregnated Omowon. Arolake, it's our child. The child is for all of us. Come to think of it, my love is and will always be yours. Always. No matter what. But for how long will we remain like this, Arolake? Without children in our home, Arolake? You also know that to build a strong household, we need to have children. You know this. Arolake. Arolake, please. Arolake, think about it, please. We all have our duties in the palace. Some of us, are you listening? Our duties are to give birth to royal children for the king. But your duty, it's different. You're just for the king's pleasure. Bimpe, let's go. I'm coming. You look... Bimpe, you look good enough. Please, come help me adjust my cap. Check if it fits. Looks like it's bigger than my head. Or it isn't? My husband, my darling. It fits your head perfectly. Come here. Where are you going? What is it? - What is happening again? - Why is it that you're always beating my children? You must find a reason to make them cry. Give her to me. Let me have her! What is it? What is wrong? What is going on here? I didn't stop you from giving birth to your children. Sorry, it's okay. It's okay. You keep making the children cry always. Omowon, that is enough! It's okay. Why did she beat my child? Is it because of her useless beads? - I say it's enough, Omowon! - Nonsense! Sorry, dear. Sorry. It's okay. You should keep your things out of the reach of her children. Sorry, my dear Banke. Sorry. Now the child is crying again. She should keep her things properly, away from the children's reach. It's enough. The next time anyone lays a finger on any of my children, it won't go down well between us. - Nonsense. - Omowon, I say it's enough! It's okay, my baby. Play with your elder brother. Where are these boys? Er... Mongudu! Master! Come help her pick her beads. It's okay. I don't need help. What did the poor man do to you, pretentious Queen? Why did you say such a thing? A matter we discussed secretly and you just blurted it out like that. And so what? Please. How is that a secret? That she is barren or was once a Queen? Please let's be on our way. Stop making a big deal out of nothing. You eventually revealed my secret to that little wench you call a wife. Right? Arolake. Listen, it's not what you think it is. - It's not what I think it is? - Yes. It's not so. No problem. Hear me out. Is it not enough that you broke my heart and neglected me? Is it not enough that you turned me into an object of mockery before your wives and everyone? - Do you wish to kill me too? - Come on. Kill you how? What do you think will happen if word gets out that the fugitive wife of the great king is alive and lives as someone else's wife in Ojumo? Arolake, you have nothing to worry about. I didn't really tell her anything. If I put you in danger, wouldn't I be in danger too? Or do you think I'll be less in trouble? Come on. My guardian, Arolake, let me hold you... Get away, please! What a shame. What a fool I've been. At least, as the wife of the great king of Oyo empire, I was the favorite one. The king's favorite. Like the moon, above all others. And he loved me. He loved me so dearly. I've now become an object of mockery to you, you highly ungrateful beast of a man! What?! How dare you say that?! You dare talk to me like that? Arolake. My husband, you're awake. The king's messenger is here to see you. Your Royal Highness. I've seen your messenger. The King greets you. Truly the King sent for you. You can see what's happened. The prince is dead. Really? This can't be. Ah, he died. Have mercy. Please bring my son back. What a pity. Have mercy. Anikulapo. Please, resurrect my son. Anything you so desire, in this village and anywhere else will be given to you. Just bring my son back, Anikulapo. This is too much, Your Highness. It is too much. This is an easy task. I'll resurrect your son, Your Highness. And it will not cost you much. But first, allow me the privilege of a private meeting with you. - Easy. - Take it easy your highness. Easy. Your Highness. - Take it easy, your Highness. - My Lord, easy. Take it easy. Take it easy. Your Highness, take it easy. We do not know what he requested. Anikulapo. So you had the guts, my daughter. That's what I want. I'm not asking for much. I only want the princess as my wife. I have been paid way more than that by people who appreciate my power. How much more from the King. Anikulapo. You're very bold. Come on! You ungrateful man. After all I've done for you and everything this community has done for you, so, this is how you'll repay my kindness? Ungrateful in what way? What special thing did any of you in Ojumo do for me? What do I have in this land that I didn't earn? Come on. The way I see it... are you listening? You are the ungrateful ones. - Ungrateful fellow. - Abomination. - The gods must not hear this. - Anikulapo! - You utter this? - Look, listen to me. This offer is not up for discussion. I will resurrect your prince. But afterwards, you will give me your daughter's hand in marriage. When you are ready, Your Highness. Anikulapo will be waiting at home. Anikulapo, please help me resurrect my son. - Let's give the princess to him. - Please. - After all, she doesn't have a husband. - Please. Accept my condolences. No! You don't have to draw your dagger. Let the prince's death be worth more to us than marriage. Please. Let him resurrect him. Let him marry her. Wake my son, Your Highness. Your Royal Highness. Help me wake my son.
