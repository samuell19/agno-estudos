What the fuck is that? That means that it's right when you're pregnant. Where did you get this? In the bathroom. I was peeing in the bathroom, and I found it beneath the toilet. Did you piss on it? Well, I was standing... I was, you know, hovering because the toilet is gross, so I was peeing, and then I looked down, and I saw this right beneath the toilet, and I... I think I might have, like, dribbled on it or something. There's piss on it, and I might have been... I might have dribbled on it because... Who you fucking? Well, nobody right now, but i... I heard on the discovery channel that sperm can live a really long time. When's the last time you fucked anyone? Like 6 or 7 months. It's not yours. No, honey. That's not mine. See? It's mine. No, it's not. It's not. Girls, this isn't yours? Ange, honey, you know what? You know, you didn't piss on it. Well, I've been wanting to get pregnant. Hey Jessie, is this yours? Get your hands off of my shit for one minute, Jessie. I'd appreciate it. Thanks. Jasmine, it may have piss on it or not because i... That's the thing! Ange, don't. Why do you want to keep it if someone pissed on that? It's not yours. OK, kids, going uptown! Stormy, what do you get for a blow job? $100. OK. Why? Just make it... Just give it to me. Jo, is this yours? What is it? Look. Hello? It's a... What do you think it is? I don't know what the fuck it is. What is it? It stinks. Get it away from me. Sit down. Sit down. What? Are you pregnant? What? Are you pregnant? Do I look like I'm pregnant? No. I'm not pregnant. What's going on? Because angel found it, and she thinks it's hers, but it's obviously not hers. Well, if angel found it, it's probably hers. Angel, honey, are you pregnant? Jo. Congratulations! Jo! Angel! You'll make such a good mother. Just don't leave the baby in the park, OK? Jo, sit down. Will you look at me? Are you pregnant? No. How late are you? I'm not late. I'm not late. I'm not late. OK. So she's not pregnant. Will you just leave your hands off of my pills? What the fuck is the matter with you people? How late are you? I'm not late, OK? All right. I got... Can't... give me this. All right. What's that mean? It means you're pregnant. It's a... it's a plus. That is a little blue plus sign right there. All right, sweetheart. I'm not a moron. I read the box, OK? All right. It's a plus sign, OK? Are you gonna keep it? No, I'm not gonna keep it. I'm gonna throw it away. That's disgusting. What do you think? No. You know I think, what happened is I got a defective e.P.T. Because it was in my... It's so beautiful.

Hey, Bobby. Bobby, have you seen Charlie? Yeah, I've seen him. He gave me a tip. Fucking asshole. I have to arrange something with him. You really want to know? Yeah. Why? What happened? Come on. Let's go for a smoke. Why? What happened? What... Asshole! God! The motherfucker! I mean, what am I supposed to do now? He told me that he was gonna come to the meeting with me. I get him something, and then he was gonna be my fiancé, and he made me a promise. He told me to my face. He said, "I'm gonna come with you," and then he goes off with the first fucking little... Well, you need the leech? Here. Here. Calm down. Oh, fuck, and I need him to show that I'm, like, you know, a whole person who's gonna get married and stuff so that... Sit down. Sit down. Sit down. Relax. You can do a lot better than Charlie. Some kid's gonna be real lucky to have you as a mom. See, he wasn't even gonna be there with me. He was just gonna go to the interview. Now what am I gonna do? Give me that fucking tip he gave you. What the fuck you doing? That's my money. That's my money! That's... That's Charlie's money. Here. You can have this. Dickhead. Tell you what. And I'll give you a ride home, all right? I'll love you a long time, Bobby. OK. Miss Willow? You can come in now. Thanks. Miss Willow, why do you want to foster a child? Well because I really love children and I really feel that I could give them a safe and happy place to be while they're waiting for their parents to get out of rehab or jail. These... sometimes the kids do come from very disturbed backgrounds, and it's important to have a safe and secure environment and someone with an open mind. Yeah. I have a very open mind. It says "the hand of friendship has no color." Like, I don't look down on Michael Jackson for changing the color of his skin. We have people in my building that are... there's 3 lesbians living in one apartment, and all of them sleep in the same bed, and they're, like, the most normal people they're... even though they sleep together, they're so nice. I'm sure they... Actually, you live in the same building, so this is an apartment on... Whitset? No. It's right around the corner from whitset. That was the direction. OK. So... OK. And so, how long have you lived in Los Angeles? 6 years? And where did you grow up? So you moved here from Oklahoma? Well, no, i... I was in las Vegas. What were you doing in Vegas? I was engaged. Did you get married? I would have, but he didn't want to marry me because I... He was a very wealthy man, but he had some character flaws. Some char... well, like, what kind of character flaws? He liked really young women. I can't imagine him finding someone more younger or attractive than you. Well, thanks, but when I turned 25, I was just kind of kicked out. Do you have a significant other now? That Charlie. He's my fiancé, and he was gonna come with me today, and I know you might be worried that he's not here, but he has a big record deal, and they needed him in New York because he might be doing some music with yanni or some other people. That's very... That's very soulful. OK. It's very soulful. What do you... What do you fear most in life? What does that bring up for you? Not being able to live. And what about the most pleasurable thing? Love. Love. Yeah. Miss Willow... What do you think... What do you think you can give a child? Well I have a Teddy bear that I had when I was a kid, and i... i... i... I make a really good fluffernutter sandwich. You are... you're... You're very charming. I want you to understand something. Fostering a child is not a hobby, and it's not like an activity... Oh, no. I know. It's very... it's serious. It's an occupation, a commitment that you're gonna make. I... I have too many hobbies already. OK. Jo, would you look at my ass? There's something in it. It stinks. Is it warts or something? No, it's not. No, sweetheart. You just cut your asshole, that's all. You should just put a little solvent... wait. You might feel sorry for me because I only made one dollar.! Please. Jesus, angel. Way to go. Put some aloe Vera on that, Jasmine. I've been thinking about little Jo because I think it would be really easy to remember because it's like your name.

We're gonna kick it into the next gear right now because coming to the stage is our resident wild child. It's Jo! Come on, girl! Yeah, do it! Get on that pole! Yeah! Yeah! Right here! Get on that pole! Jo, it's enough. Dave, Dave, get over here. Get her off the stage! What the fuck is the matter with you? What the fuck is the matter with you? What the fuck is the matter with you? Get her off the stage! Jo! Jo, get off the stage! Get her off the stage now! Get her out! Get her off the stage! Angel, get out onstage! Get onstage! I think you need to calm down, all right? Angel to the stage. Angel to the stage. Get on now! All right. OK. Here we go. Jo! Oh, fuck! What the fuck?! Get off me! Take your hands off me! What the fuck is the matter with you? Is this her shit? Is this her shit? Yes. Is this her shit? Get the fuck out! Get out of here! You're a big man, aren't you? You're a big man! Get your hands off me, you shit! You shit! Let her go! All right, Dave. Keep her out of here. My stuff! I want my stuff, Jessie! I want my stuff! Give me my stuff! Here's your bag. OK. This one's from me. "Pale shades of gray "left the clouds above the bed have filled. "There is no smile in this room, "no laugh during love. "A pall gently descends over the space "once a sanctum, now a hollow shape "as the sun rises and my eyes fill with black." Thank you. I've got a very special surprise for us today. I decided to bring up a special mystery guest, and it's someone who's actually never read before, I want you to give a really big encouragement. Let's hear it for Jasmine. Jasmine... Come on up. You don't want to read? Come on up. Give it a try. Let's give her encouragement, guys. Yeah! We've all been there. My name is Cathy. "If, in the skylark tonguing afternoon a drift of hair, "it's only love but gone in the way of everything. "If, in the morning of your soul "a brush of tenderly imagined lips, "it's only love but gone in the way of everything. "If, in the messy cocktail dregs of a midnight glass "a teardrop falls, "it's only love but gone in the way of everything. "If, in the singing twilight of the dawn, "you give your heart unwanted, "it's only love but gone in the way of everything. "Then what in the hours of your life is love? "It's here and gone... And gives its name to everything." All right. Well, that's it for today, so we'll see everybody next time, and thanks a lot. Why did you call my name? I didn't ask you to call my name. I don't even know you. That poem was really great. Cathy, i... It was really great. I don't know what to say. Yeah, well, thanks. Look, have you got any more? You got to get up and read. I mean, that's all. You got to get up and read. Why? Because you're good. I hate to disappoint you, but you're really good. Who is it? It's... It's me. It's you? Yeah, it was sitting around my apartment. That's me. This woman I used to be with... Maria... She's beautiful. She was a painter. She painted that thing. She was north African. She had this pretty heavy accent, man, and lived in Paris, New York... And she had me sit 5 weeks... 5 weeks to do that thing. You sit still for 5 weeks? You can't sit still for 5 minutes. Yeah... And she would talk to me. She would talk about... Shapes and colors... Light, shadow... All the stuff, you know... Painter shit, you know? And then she would use all of that, and that's what popped this thing to life. Like, she could look at your body, and she would paint you, but she would bring out shit that you never, ever see, you know what I mean? She was a wild girl, too, man. When she got tired in the afternoon, she'd say, "Eddie, want to eat?" I was alone in this room, and... This apartment with this guy I used to live with in Seattle... So I would just, you know, sit and read all day, and one day, I just couldn't stand it any longer, and I, you know, shut all the blinds, and... And I was, like, bawling my eyes out, and I wrote it. I tore it up. I can't believe you want to hear this stuff. Were you stripping then? Yeah. Yeah, I was working up in Seattle. This kid who works for me said he saw you dance. Oh, yeah? Yeah. In this dream I had last night... That I got in a fight with down in San Diego? I don't remember him on purpose. My hand just cutting him, cutting him, cutting his face, man, blood just getting on everything, blood getting all over. Then I couldn't wash my hands. Remember that phone call? The girl crying I played for you the other day? Erase it. No, I would have erased it last week. I would have said "fuck the bitch," man, but... I don't know. This week, I can't say fuck the bitch, you know what I mean? You got some herb with you? Yeah. Why don't you roll us a joint? So do you... do you go to strip clubs? Yeah, you don't seem like the type. Yeah? What's the type? Yeah, there's this kid who works for me... Oh, yeah. He's the kind of kid that goes. Yeah, he said you were on a billboard. Yeah, the blue iguana has a couple. I'm only on one of them since my tits are small, but I'm going to get them done. So are you the kind of guy who likes big tits? I'm not really used to that line of questioning, to tell you the truth. Do you have any other writers at your club? You know, maybe we could change the whole venue. I don't know what you're doing with me. You should be with, like, that French girl. She's a good poet. I really want to kiss you. No. I really want to kiss you. I want to kiss the poet. Do you have a problem with me dancing? No. Angel... Yeah? I have something for you. Again? Oh, my god! What is it? Open it up. Wha... My gosh! That is lovely. Look at that. Look at that. My god. Jewels. Yes, it's jewels. And look... Charlie? Charlie? Hey, baby! What a minute! Guess what! Charlie! Charlie! They don't want me. Charlie! Want to know why? Because I hang out with skanks like you! Charlie! Please stop it! You're hurting me! Charlie! Aren't you pretty? Just fuck morals! Charlie, I'm sorry! Come here! I'm sorry, Charlie. I'm sorry, Charlie. I met someone. OK. What's his name? Dennis. Dennis, and... And... And I think... I don't know. He's a poet. He runs that thing at the coffee ground, and... He likes my poetry, so... So you're gonna go to San Francisco with Dennis? Yeah, he invited me up there. There's this big slam, and... And you're gonna support him stripping? No. I don't know. No. I thought we'd just kind of write together, and... Does he know what you do? He's, like, totally fine with it. He really fucking loves my poetry. So he thinks that I can, you know... I don't know, get published or something, you know? Does he love you? I just met him, like, 3 days ago. I think that you should go to San Francisco with Dennis the poet, who you met 3 days ago and write poetry and support him. I need some more fucking cigarettes. Bad! You are bad! You are very, very, very, very, very bad! Very bad! Very bad! I've had a bad week and been terrible. I don't care about your week. Do I give a fuck about your week? I don't care about your week. Are you hungry? Yes, mistress, starving. All right, there you go. Bless you, mistress. Thank you. It's time to take the little wormy for a walk. Get down on the ground and crawl! Crawl! Crawl! Crawl! Crawl like the subhuman creature that you are! You're a fuck... All right, you just stay right here, OK? I'm fine. Jessie, what are you doing here? I just thought... it's 3:00 in the morning. I just thought that maybe you needed a little company. Well, sweetheart, you thought wrong. I have company. Good-bye. Who is that? Jessie! Jessie, I'm right in the middle of something. Can't you tell? I have a life. Can you go, please? Angel said you might need some company on account of the baby and all. Company is the last fucking thing I need. You've got to go. Good-bye. No. All right. Don't talk to him. He's being punished, OK? Anyway, he doesn't exist. He's just a little, pathetic worm. Get down on the floor! Did I tell you to sit up? Get down on the floor! I don't need any conversation from you. Jessie, come on. Get up off the floor. I have, mistress. I've been terrible. All right. Stop! Stop, all right? Stop! You, don't talk to her. Don't talk to her, OK? Can't you see we're in the middle of something? Jessie, come on. Here. Sit down. Sit down. Does this pathetic thing look like something I would have fun with? This is not a friend of mine. This is a client. Do you mind if I stay? Shut up! Get down on the ground! Right away, mistress. Are you hungry, worm? Oh, yes. Drink! Drink the fucking vodka! Keep your head on the... Jessie! Don't you drink that. It's dirty. Get up. No, you are not having two mistresses this evening. Jessie, that does it. You've got to get out of here. Go on, go on. Get out of here. Go on. No. No, Jo. Please let me stay. Jo, I have nowhere to go. Let's not get all melodramatic. All right. Come here. Get up. Stand up. Do you mind if I stay tonight? See, he doesn't mind if I stay. Your opinion does not count. Jessie... What the fuck is this? Who did that to you? No, I just want to have a slumber party. Do you want to have a slumber party? Can you stay out of this, OK? I want to have a slumber party. Don't. You don't know where he's been. You need to lie down and sleep it off. This is not a place for kids. Come on, Jo. I want to play. You can stay here, but you can't stay here for more than one night, because I have, frankly, a life. But I want to play, Jo. No. No. You lie here and be really quiet and don't bother me when I'm doing my business with the nice man, OK? Just when you get back... ♪ there's this girl Cecilia ♪ ♪ Who was a sweetheart ♪ as a child Officer? Officer, could... Could you help me take a picture of my... I want to take a picture of myself in front of this billboard. Is that you? Yeah. Really? I'm a lot smaller in person, but... I think I'm only getting my hat. You realize you're not supposed to be down here? Sorry. I'm gonna leave as soon as i... I just wanted to get a good shot of my... All right. My picture. Thanks. Is it ready to go? Yeah. There.

You know, the guy who was Herman munster. No. No one's ever told me that before. You do. I really liked him. He was, like, the great... fuck! Shit! I fucking locked my keys in my car, and I've got to be at work. Oh, no. Damn it. Do you have a hanger? This side's open. Will you unlock this door for me? Sure. Thanks. Yeah. This right here. This is the lock right... Ma'am, is this marijuana? It's just... it's an herbal cigarette. You want to step around the side of the car, please? I... I did not inhale. Step around the side of the car. This will only take a minute. It's probably just oregano. You should probably have it examined because I don't even feel stoned. I will have it examined. It'll just take a second, OK? Do... do you have to handcuff me? But you can find me at the blue iguana, like, every day. I'm really a good person, ma'am, I'm just gonna ask you to stand still just for a few minutes, OK? OK. I'm just gonna take a look in the car OK, but it's just that I have responsibilities and children that I might need to be a role model for, and if I get a record, it would be really bad. Where... is this your purse? Yeah, that fuzzy... the pink... This? Yeah. Officer, is there any way you could maybe... I got an extension on it, and I'm gonna... It's the one that says "bad motherfucker" on it. Did you ever see Pulp Fiction? Well, you know, John Travolta's career came back after that. I was sick when they took that picture. Officer... A lot of bills, ma'am. Yeah, they're all ones, but... You can have some. What are these? They're my friend Jo's vitamins for her pregnancy, I think. Is there any way that officer, that maybe you could forget about this, because I'm really a good person. You know, you could come down to the blue iguana, and they let L.A.P.D. In there all the time for free because we're a really clean club. And Eddie gets mad... Our manager... Sometimes he can't even get them out of the club and my friend Jo, she works with a lot of L.A.P.D. Guys, and... She's really beautiful. I'm sure she'd... I'm gonna ask... Well, I'm happy to hear that. I'm gonna ask you to stay by the car while I go run the license and registration, all right? But, officer is this gonna be, like, on the news or anything? No, no, no, no, no. Because I don't... I really can't... I don't... I've always wanted to be in the enquirer but not for, like, getting arrested. I thought maybe if I had, like, a handsome hunk or a nice dress or something... Is there... is... Shit! It won't take a minute. OK. Shit! Hi, Eddie. Where's Jasmine? She wasn't feeling too well.

"When light shattered across the floor "and briefly there was a thunder between us, "if your eyes had held water, "it would have not spilled, "and when we peeled aside the dreams, "the skin underneath was still young. "You smoothed aside the words and said, "it's there, the light. When you want it, it'll be waiting for you." "A certain peace came into your eyes... "That this was no different, "that this was so different, "yet every bit the same. "And your hands stilled with satisfaction. "You did this without touch... "Your hands stood, shaped like shelters. "All around me, there was room, "the hallways outside were like caverns. "And around the corner and down the stairs, "there lurked, as always, light... As ever, light." Is it about a guy? No. Is it about you? No. Maybe. I'm sorry. I just had a bad day. Do you have a light? Yeah. What's it about? It's about... It's about... You know how... You know how, like, when you're in here, and it's always dark. It's always, like, 1:00 in the morning. It's about, you know, morning... Stuff inside you. Stuff inside you. Me, too. It's a nice poem. Thank you. You know what a cryptographer is? I never paid attention in school. It's a code breaker. During the war... That's what Harry was. There are only two or three of them in the whole world, and Harry was one of them. He was the best, man. That shit's gonna kill you, boy. Hope so. Want to get something to eat? Sure. You know, I'll give that old Jew one thing. Hope to god when I'm that old, I still love pussy like he does, even if I've got to use binoculars to see it. Have you ever sang? Yeah, like in public, in front of people? Yeah, a long time ago. You did? Did you get nervous? Yeah. Yeah, because Jessie's going over to dimples this afternoon. You know, the place over in Burbank... karaoke... And a bunch of the girls are going, so... What, our girls? Jessie said everybody can sing, so I thought, you know, what the fuck? Our girls can sing? Yeah. Goddamn. This Russian motherfucker got shot... And some shot. Right through the heart, in the window of his house over in woodland hills. Damn! Quick way to go. So, I thought, if you weren't doing anything, if you drop by, we could, like, do it together, like a duet, a frank and Sammy kind of thing. What time is that? 3:00. No, man.
