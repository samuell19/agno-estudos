I won't be until after lunch. No, I'm not sick. Fucking. Visions. Energy. Dedication. Three career-promoting words. Here are the other two: "Listen to me." Things are starting to change. Change with them - or leave your pass and disappear - the best TV company in the world. Soft thinking is the job of the sheep. The fox collects the creams from the top. Second, the best is not an option. Receive the message! - Sorry. So? - My egg is ready. - Fuck me now. - Fuck you? I'm just meeting. Sorry, Nigel. One colleague has not yet received the message. Sorry. EMERGENCY EXIT BABY FEVER Good morning. Did the lady order a pan service? Yes! Yes! Yes! - What the hell have you been? - At an important meeting. Horizontal deep penetration. Good. You haven't missed much. Some idiot sounded the alarm. When trying to make a baby - a woman's egg is like cooking an egg. Timing is difficult. You just have to seize the opportunity. - Sorry but now was the right time. - It's a pleasure to help. - Isn't it beautiful? - Yes, I think so. Not comparable to our wedding. Hey? Quick "I want" and snacks in the park? Picnic and sonnet. The most important thing is not how, but with whom you get married. - I have been lucky. - So do I. Do you still feel lucky? Despite everything? I'm lucky because of everything. You are everything to me. In adversity and adversity. I hoped it would work. The church was close by. Maybe next month. - You promised to try. - I can't write a diary. It is not a diary but a letter to yourself. Maybe if we wrote about our thoughts and feelings - we would not feel so at the mercy of destiny. I didn't come up with anything to write. I'm not going to talk to Sam about it. It also applies to him - and he handles the matter in his own way. He bought this lovely William. The diary has helped me. If you cry, I write about my thoughts. However, as I write about my thoughts, I begin to cry. No dice. My imagination is as fruitless as my testicle. Do not say that. I'm sorry, Lucy. I did not mean it. It was a silly joke. Everything is going to be alright. Wait a minute, I'll see if you ovulate first. - I was thinking of studying accounting. - He's like a short Brad Pitt. - We would save a lot of money. - Short red-haired Brad Pitt. - What if you bump into fat? - I'll take the baby to work. No can do! No milk leaking breasts are needed here. Under European law, you are obliged to arrange treatment. Shut up, you fool! I'm a vegetarian and heroin use have finished. I'm not on chicken but on tofur granules. Ota kokokuvaa. - Heroin stuff before 9 p.m. - The new boss wants that. - Drug jokes to the top. - You should like Nigel. - Should make more movies. - Rewind to the vomiting site. I thought you wanted to write a movie. Here is your chance. Lucy says little Cuthbert is wonderful. He cannot speak, drink milk or control his gut. Hello? - Those don't work here. - Duty calls. I have to leave control in your hands, George. It's a matter of care. Cut for a couple of minutes, then on the beer. This is Cuthbert. I'll call him a plum, you'll probably see why. I would laugh, but I would tear the stitches that were put in after I got him. You should have greased your perineum with Vaseline. - Is there an animal in that? - Just a little chicken broth. It is not worth eating. Decaying meat stays in the intestine for a month. You can't get pregnant if you're full of rotten meat! - How's work going, Sam? - He hates his job. - You think life flies past you. - Relationships require sacrifices. Women sacrifice the most. Now think of Lucy, too. - You didn't graduate, did you? - I read Shakespeare by distance learning. I don't have a brain anymore, just a mushroom full of milk. If you have a problem, Sam, it's up to you. It's not anyone else's fault. You must not stand in the way of your happiness. My hands just miss. I have to look at my innermost being. But I don't have one. - Write about something you know. - I do not know anything about anything. - Write about your feelings. - I do not feel anything. That's God's way of saying - - you are not a writer. - Don't listen to him. I'm serious, Lucy. Western culture is the only - who has lost all his fertility rituals. The only culture where the birth rate is declining. Hello! - Now we have to... Listen! - I'm listening. We need to harness the ancient power and mystique of your vagina. The air is full of pagan spirits. There are them everywhere. Why not take advantage of them? Court! Court! Do not laugh. It may have worked. I can't leave anything untried. Druscilla talked about alternative therapies. Visualization group, aromatherapy massage. If you fuck a character in Dorset on the penis can get pregnant. Is there anything closer, like Brent Cross? Primrose Hill has some good power lines. Let's find out one thing: I guess you're not going crazy? Do you? Cheers, Carl. We are glad you decided to choose us. Thank you, Sheila. After this silly celebrity chore - I have felt more product than the actor. I want to grow up as an actor, take on challenges. The dream of a summer night is made Welsh in North Wales. At least it's challenging. I want a job that is in London, mostly in English. Or en francais... Tai italiaanoksi. No niin, Carl... Welcome. Should I dress like this? We just look like Addams Family. We need to bring out our ancient sexuality. Like timeless horny animals. - For God's sake. - What? I stepped to largest dog a row, upon which I have seen. There is no guarantee of a mortal dog. I sank to my knees. - Shut up, Sam! - An elephant who escaped from the zoo. I didn't like these shoes. - Isn't it beautiful? - Yes it is. This makes you feel so small. But what we came here to do - is as large as the universe itself. New life, Sam. - It was wonderful. - The knees just hurt. It is reminiscent of a scene from a Midsummer Night's Dream. - Is there sex under the power line? - No, I mean magic. Hermia and Lysander fall asleep in the enchanted forest next to each other. - Do you remember that point? - Twilight. I remember reading sonnets to me. I tried to impress. You don't go to that thread anymore. Pants on the leg so we are not arrested. Film is the art of the millennium. British films are in. Last year, three films gained popularity in the United States. What am I trying to say? Can you guess? - We should make movies. - Thank you, George. I need scripts, smart and provocative. Hands that define the spirit of time. Follow the signs. "Thank you, George." Come now. The green light is on. My heat is optimal. - I guess I didn't interrupt anything? - Not really. Let's get started then. Where has it gone? Yes, it still excites me about this. - Is anything going on there? - Certainly not if you ask about it. In the morning, a towel could have been hung on it! Anyone gets it when they don't want it. The door knobs of the bouncy castle are also harder. - Do I breathe a little life into it? - If it doesn't hurt. - Well done, my orh. - I think it should be taken care of. Do you have to land around? Do my sperm just swim downhill? We must use all means. - Do you have to leave already? - I have to go to work too. - BBC's main lunches. - It feels so mechanical. According to Druscilla, a gentle massage promotes fertility. Drusc has a crazy witch-akka. Where are my socks? It would be nice if there was more mystique and romance in life. Right, mysticism. Gotcha. Hi, I'm Sam Bell. How are you? Nice to meet you. Sam... If the BBC is serious about producing comedies - Kiss My Ark is the company you want to work with. - Two words: Zeit and Geist. - Tomorrow's comedy today. Well done. That's what the new production manager wants. Sick Junkie is a comedy about just ordinary young people. Everyone is a junkie. Welsh, Irish, Scots. We follow their weekdays for a week. They cannon heroin in their eyes, giving birth in toilets. They get AIDS and look for an intact vein in their genitals. Kill a social worker, buy stuff for anal sex. The stuff has been mixed with bleach and they will die. Do abortions. They are being raped by the police. Do I understand correctly now? So this should be a comedy? It's a full comedy, but based on reality. What really happens, and no escapist shit. Thank you. It's not about whether I shouldn't. Not at all. - "I hate" is closer to the truth. - Well that's good. - Not in this case. - What do you mean? I don't think the BBC's job is to fund cynical stories - depicting real life - so that the fashion pellets that make them can jump to work in the US. That hell of an English soap. Do you want a movie or not? I will contact. I wish Sam was more romantic. I don't want any Carl Phips - not that he's a Pull - However, he smiles so lovely even though I am a poor thing. You look great, Lucy, if I may say so. After all, I was just wearing a short skirt and a tight top. I looked awful. Stupid to claim anything else. Am I massaging you now? Rose and iris promote estrogen production. Rub gently but vigorously on the back and back. - Rub gently. I'm not dough. - I'm thinking about something else. - Before, you liked my ass. - It's not a question. - I just have worries. - So you don't like me. You'd be sure to rub the oil on Cameron Diaz's butt. - Maybe, in theory. - Do so. Don't let me stop. - I'm not going to do that. - But she's charming to you. It doesn't matter. Charm does not mean infidelity. - So you want other women. - I don't want to. The fact that men are faithful is proof of love. If you're about desperate, then just let go. I book tickets for the Frenzy of Love show at the Barbican. I am writing an essay for a Shakespeare course. For God's sake, do you do it voluntarily? - You don't want to join? - It would be nicer to watch the paint dry. Sam... I would like to talk about our sex life and having a child. Basically the same thing. That doesn't bother me. We have a problem. It's time to go to the doctor. Psychologically, it's a pretty big step. We may have to admit we don't have children. We don't have children. Alan likes him. - I need to give a sperm sample. - I do not want to know. Don't sober up. You have produced a giant baby, Cuthbert. Sperm is like a fart. It doesn't matter if it's yours. If only I fail and I find out there are no coincidences in the swamps. - Motherfucker! - How do you know? I just found out you loved Ewan Proclaimer. You proud asshole too. Proclaimer is the latest peak. He is a God-given antidote to the bull produced by your department. - Why did you love him? - Because his idea was bad. I made a favorite decision. I guess that's my job? Yes, it's your job. For now. You are jealous. Where is your own script? Where is Sam Bell's masterpiece? Nowhere. In the same place you are and where you are going. I messed up my cause at work. - I might lose my job. - Oh no. Maybe everything will turn out for the best . Maybe it's an opportunity. - An opportunity to do what you want. - I want to write again. I just don't know where. What happened? - Did that hurt? - I fell with my bike... Don't touch my son! You must not touch my son. Don't be paranoid now! He was just trying to help. Damn. For some, the world revolves only around their beloved children. I wouldn't be like that. - Except, of course, you would. - Probably. If I had the chance. - Now I came up with! - What? A topic to write about. I should write about us. A comedy about a childless couple. Of course! A modern tragicomic story - life and its absence. Sad jokes, they are the best. About sperm tests and imagination exercises. The couple's sex life breaks down, the woman only thinks of the baby. - She cries when she sees the baby clothes. - No, Sam. - Don't like the idea? - How can you even consider that? No, you're right. It was a silly idea. - I just wouldn't stand it. - Why should I. But you said I should look inside. I did not ask to make our tragedy a laughing stock. That's right, you don't. What could Carl read at the gala for the warriors? You know Shakespeare, don't you? It must not be too gloomy. The subject is love. The gala being televised should be positive and sexy. - Don't Sheila now. - Don't forget to think about your career. - Lucy? - Would an eighteenth sonnet fit? It's a little sweet - but the most beautiful love poem ever written. - How does it go? - You must have heard it. Sua summer day would I compare But you are gentler Spring wind buds grate And summer time is too short May the eye of heaven burn hot So often its splendor dims And everything beautiful will eventually disappear Coincidentally or through destiny But your eternal summer Never fade away You never go in the shadow of death When you grow into eternal beauty - Wrong number. - As long as the person is breathing So live this And give you life You're about to turn me back straight, Phipps. Thanks for the tip, Lucy. You are so wonderful... When you help these orphaned children. So. - Are you going to sleep soon? - Soon. Don't monitor too late. There is an early meeting tomorrow. How could I forget? - Do you want me to help? - Thank you for the offer - but the seriousness of the situation requires the expertise of an expert. - Alright. Then think of me. - Women! Can a man be unfaithful when he is alone? You think Cameron Diaz. Did I! According to some psychologists , a lively imagination - is an important part of a monogamous relationship. I will not discuss this further. According to the invitation, Steffi Graf, the girls of Corrs and Baby Spice. I'm sorry about the film-from the idea - - but I guess you understand? - Sure, of course. Good night. - Am I taking this to the bathroom? - Yes please. Tomorrow I'll give you a sperm sample And the cup is waiting on the shelf Tomorrow I'll give you a sperm sample And the cup is waiting on the shelf I sit in the bathroom And I pollute myself Less than I hoped. - Did you get everything to come? - As much as I could. What a disappointment. Like a little bird sneezing. If only I would continue it with water and flour. Would not it? Best left. It must be taken within 50 minutes. In pants, it stays warm. I hope I don't get under the car. Bye then. Taxi! - I have an important meeting. - I have sperm in my ass. Sam Bell. I have delivery. Let it go deep... I got it. Good morning. So for the sake of the Creator. When he was younger, he was a master of masturbation. Now he is like being hanged from his testicles. But does Sam support you? I guess he'll take your needs into account? Of course. She is wonderful, in her own way. - Look, there's Carl Phipps! - Where? Sorry, my plate is dirty. I guess that's my main course. This then is a film art genius who thinks that I am - "tasteless, cynical exploiter." - So the fax arrived. - Ewan Proclaimer, George. - Hey. - What's up dude. When was the last time you wrote, my backward Englishman? You never, right? And why? Because you are a talented piston. A parasite that fattens the ass to the spikes of others - and wishes himself a better fucking hell. About well no one could say that, dude. - It was a great hand, of course... - It's shit and I threw it away. I already knew it before you but nonetheless - My shit shit on your shit because I even write something. You tell shit writers they write shit. You're pretty pathetic. Bastard. - I will disappear. - I like him. Great color choice, by the way. - You look first. - This is not a final exam. The result of the blood test is good. I was apparently ovulating. Then the fault is in me. I am a eunuch. Look, I can't. "Samuel Bell's sperm sample: 30% lazy." "Lazy"? Is that the word they use? Why not "relaxed" or "unhurried"? - Casual sperm would be rockier. - "Low mobility." That's already outrageous! - "41% are moving in the wrong direction." - They're in a plastic jar! There is no right direction in that. Sperm is lazy and stupid. For years I stumbled back and forth towards my cock. "Assessment: Normal." So here it is said. Your sperm is no worse than anyone else. Great! The score is now 1-0. Sperm test passed. Developable but good result at this point. Would you go for lunch? Carl Phipps came into the office and was as gloomy as Byron. He was like a gloomy lord whose castle has been deprived of him. Her aftershave smells like Kanerva! I was as cool as a file. You are nice when you ask, but I'm here alone today. Sheila has bronchitis . As a medicine, set 40. He coughed something that looked like a pond dweller. Joanna is in Los with Trudi Hobson . Some action movie. A sequel called Shit 2 or something. - Everyone has the right to a lunch break. - Yes, it is. I'm celebrating. An American big movie. Want to chat. Aromatic oils... I took the course once. Therapeutic massage. I have an official qualification. In Shiatsu and reflexology as well. I don't get enough of alternative therapies. Beautiful. This is really nice, but if you want to party - Don't want to party with someone important? That's what I do. Creator! My neck starts to itch again. As a teenager, if the boy approached, the neck was immediately reddish. What do you mean, Carl? Unbelievable that I write like this, but he caressed my palm - which, as far as I know, means, "I would love to put you now." And why do birds have such naughty names? Haarapääsky, punarinta... Is he more fun or have I just stopped resisting? Lucy and I are having a post- intercourse test. After having sex, the doctor looks at the aftermath. Why do you think I want to know that? Your doctor will see you now. Pooter is a medical student. Does it matter if he watches? Of course I want some silly teenager - tuck open the applied vagina. No, of course not. Good. This, Pooter, we do not need today. This may be necessary later. And this is necessary. On a moped, I save 17 minutes every day. Admittedly, I say that. See how everything is... Try to relax, Lucy. Try to relax yourself with a trumpet in your ass. I try. That was it. There is now a little slipperiness at the lower end, due to the ointment. Don't be embarrassed, it was me. - A children's program? - Exactly. Tea water for children. We aim to develop light entertainment in this area. You want me out, but this is cheaper than firing. Hello? Melinda! Now doesn't really fit... Oh no. Suspected meningitis. We will only receive the information later. Nothing is known now. Thanks for coming. I was right. I lost my job. We don't have to starve, I move on to children's programs. - Melinda may lose her child. - I know. What can we do? We do nothing. If we are childless, there is no need to endure such a thing. - Yes, think positively! - I'm not that... How else did it go? - How did the test go? - Well, it went well. Medically, we are compatible. Hey, Lucy. Sheila and Joanna are... You have cried. What's wrong? My friend's child may die. Suspected meningitis. Come sit here. The majority of suspected cases are just that: Doubts. - How do you know that? - I've starred in the doctor sometimes. In these cases, the symptoms are often quite vague. Sometimes the right cause doesn't figure out, the baby just gets better. Babies are tenacious. Brave... Although they don't look like it. Carl, I... I like you, Lucy. Too much, I guess. From now on, I will try to keep more distance between us. That's the best thing. If you want to chat... Okay? Do you want a piece of cake, Mrs. Turriainen? Us us. Hall hall. I don't like that the Turrians live a completely heterosexual life. What do you think, Sam? You're the boss. You decide. We need to negotiate with the target group. Well. Thank you for coming. You make us a television channel. The BBC is yours. So... Do you have any comments? Anything. Is there any other little damage? That's what you see. They really like you. Why are you awake? What are you writing? I didn't get to sleep and thought to write in my diary. As you said: A letter to myself. - Can I read it? - Absolutely not. I know it's private. I would die if you read mine. I'm going to sleep now. Some have sex on a lime man's penis. - The heat has finally dropped. - That's good! Maybe I'm reminded like this that I can't live without him. That's fantastic. Gloomy, dramatic... - When did you write this? - You know how creative I am. Sorry I'm late. - Cuthbert is reportedly safe. - Not from me. He returned my Baumler suit. Everyone has liked your hand. How does Lucy feel? This is pretty personal. - As the back side of the pads below. - Miracle that you can write. He has not given permission. He asked to forget the story. - He will kill you. - But I couldn't forget the thing. I hate my job. Have you seen the Turrias? Cuthbert doesn't want to watch it. The script is the best thing I've done in years. Lucy understands. That's my story, too. Another one? I can't anymore. Forced. The test tube in fertilization has its own tests. It is not the end of the world. You don't have to fuck a hedgehog. I'm undergoing hysterosalpingography! I masturbate in public. What could be more awful? Application and scraping, cold metal objects - and be pumped full of air. UK every doctor staring at her pussy on a daily basis. Oh, you're invoking that woman thing. Will William have fleas? You scrape yourself all the time. It just tickles me at certain points. Probably an allergy. Nowadays, he just wants to write in his diary. I should be happy when he deals with his feelings - If only he would share them with me. You don't have to fuck a hedgehog. - Whether you are suddenly excited. - I just want to get acquainted. I didn't even know what laparoscopy was before. Damn. I forgot to shave my bikini line. That sounds ridiculous, but I want to look good. - That's good. That's fun. - It's not fun, Sam. - The whole thing is humiliating. - Of course. Sorry. The bed is ready, Mrs. Bell. - Wish luck. - Good luck. Laparoscopy, shave bikini line. Looks good. You have great guts. Beautiful, really beautiful. And a large colon too. Definitely works great. Large, porous stools. Well done. What do we have here? Endometriosis, abdominal attachment - malignant fibroids, cyst, abdominal disease - - congenital defect in the womb... - Dear time! And you don't have any of them. And excellent intestines. You've just ovulated, which is great news. Omelettes cannot be made without eggs. By omelet I mean baby. That was it. Everything looks good, there is nothing wrong. I'm not pregnant. Except you're not pregnant. We don't know why you don't - - but that is good news. - Is it? You could have had a Pavarotti-sized cyst. Everything feminine should have been removed from the sides to the knees. It is called unexplained infertility. Or in technical terms: No damn smell. Very ordinary space, indeed. In the world of unintentional infertility, therefore. - Is it too wonderful? - No, that's really good. - It's personal. - It becomes more personal. You dramatize your life, you and Lucy. - What happens when he finds out? - Most ideas don't come true. If this is filmed, I will think about it then. Until then, it's a crazy dream and we have permission to dream. Is not it true? The door is open. Hey. Welcome. I included an agreement you wanted to discuss with me. That's what I said to Sheila. It's a standard contract, quite simple. It is a standard contract. - I am not interested in the agreement. - Sheila said that... I know what I said. - What do you mean? - I wanted to be with you two. - I'm married, I love my husband. - You're lonely. - I'm not. - You are, and so am I. And... I've tried to stay away from - but I can not. Please stop... Make love to me. I'm in love with you. You don't mean that. I mean. I can not. You are lovely and beautiful but I love my husband. It's not exciting, but nothing is forever. Is not it? A sad way of thinking. I'm sorry, I have to go. Are you calling a taxi? Toki, totta kai. I'm sorry, Carl - but I love my husband. I won't meet Carl anymore. There is such a bad conscience. I don't want Carlia. I want Sam, he's the only one I want. And that we have a child. Dear God, if you read this: Let the in vitro fertilization succeed. I so desperately want to have a baby. There was rubbish in my eyes. There are problems with the hand. It's too manly. - "Manly?" - Colin masturbation is fun - but Rachel worries us. He is too superficial. He has good replicas, but the perspective is masculine. Would we get a woman as a second screenwriter? Have you gone crazy? Rachel can be improved, it will be arranged. - That's my story! Me and Lucyn. - Exactly. You have to tell Lucy. Blame the female writer for everything. No one robs my script. Then destroy your marriage. But a woman's voice needs to be included. Leave it to me. Was there anything else? Would not it? Thank you. Whatever happens, I am going to stay a mentally healthy woman. I read to my child Beatrix Potter and Winnie the Pooh. The gear cannot be changed if the legs are crossed. I found myself looking at baby clothes again. Sometimes when everything feels overwhelming - I pray. Hei, Lucy. Was it a nice bath? Good. - Are you well? - Yes, just fine. You haven't had dandruff before. Psoriasis. The skin is dry and flaky. It cannot be cured. Arrested Development. It often strikes when there is stress. Do you have stress? No! So nothing. I have no worries. - Action! - I want freedom. - I demand security. - I'll do what I want. Tajuutteks too? Across. Rampant reign. Let's go to lunch. Tamponimainos. To pay the bills. I got your hands on it. You can be a shit dude, but talented. Needs healing, but I will film it. When do I get the rest of the hand? About six weeks. This should stop ovulation. In a month and a half we can be older. It's best to start hiding breakable valuables. Cuthbert did not intentionally break the model. He crawls. When not screaming, Shit or vomit. - That looks awful. - I think it's the highlight of the day! You better get used to it. You have to prick me too. That would be a funny scene. What did you say? If anyone could see it, it would be funny. If someone saw from the window. This thorny thing is great. We show a peak on the screen - which is not a heroin spike. So original and liberating. It has not been done for years. It could be more fun. Even if the hormones mix with Colin's hepo store - and Rachel would prick them instead of drugs? Have fun. Except that Colin doesn't use drugs. - Would not it? Are you kidding me? - En. Fascinating. So is it true that you practiced pricking? - It's true. - Absolutely insane. Adults learn to use the syringe. Totally unbelievable. The orange did not seem to feel pain. It shouldn't hurt if I do it quickly and decisively. Are you ready? One two Three... The hallways pulsate with repressed sexual energy. Love channels with doors. Add light to make it look sterile. Absolute umbilical cord but cold, calcified and dead. How is the division of roles going? It's starting to be in a hurry. The actors are like cattle. - How old is the girl? 22? 23? - Closer to thirty. Leave it undefined. She must not be a teenager - but even somewhat naive looking. Anything from a mature 19 year old to a young 25. I'm just asking you to handjob, not marry a hedgehog. I'm undergoing hysterosalpingography! Thank you... Tilda Bustle. 175 cm, 75B. Horse riding, martial arts. That was touching, Tilda. You have depth. Thank you. Next. - Everyone is too young. - Isn't that awful? - Is the place booked for the whole week? - Is. Good. Brilliant. Picture, sketch... Use this. Good. I can already see it in the eyes of my soul. Sam! Such needles did you use? It is injected into a muscle, normally in the buttocks. It hurts. The name of the film should be My Ass is an orange. - Its name is Pure. - Yes. For now. Sam is better at his job, but not at sperm tests. I took the draft contract to Carl Phipps today. I'm afraid it ever since when he kissed me. - What are you doing there? - Nothing! He had planned it, but it was my fault too. I went to the bedroom with him. He took off his shirt and asked me to stay. I said I love my husband and he called a taxi. Thank God nothing happened. At least almost. Why are you staring at me like that? One last remark. If you can. My sperm is stupid. For years I stumbled towards my cock. It's lazy, sluggish, and doesn't know where to go. Like a tavern full of men. That was great, Carl. Really great. - It can become something. - Petra, Justin... - Brilliant. Bravo. - Thank you for coming to the test. No one is too big. Especially if Ewan directs. What an asshole. - What did you like? - In view of the threats of rainforests - was unecological to give some woody performance. - Tight, stiff... - Absolutely convincing my Englishman. Couldn't you do something about that psoriasis? The worst thing about incurable disease is - - that everyone knows the cure. - Cousin had psoriasis. The naturalist recommended banana peel for the entire skin. That's what you see. - If you told Lucy... - Dandruff is more pleasant than death. Lucy has suggested alternative therapies. Lots of mucus. Very slimy. Very warm inside. Very dry, very slimy. Too much mucus. Too slimy. No tomatoes, no meat. Plus... Make tea. I saw a lot three times a day. Then drink. I put six needles in your acupuncture points - and twelve needles for anus. It helps to relax. You are excited. Unbelievable that all of this is made into a movie. Infertility is made into a film. We got a hand. I didn't read it, but embarrassed when I stopped you from writing. Do you mean I should have written about it? I couldn't stand it being based on our own lives. It would have been too personal. One of our actors, Carl Phipps, plays a husband. He's definitely good. Nice and sensitive actor. - Sam! - I'm sorry. Good God, let me get pregnant. I want so badly. Would it be better if I was closer to the camera? Let's try. - Good God, let me... - I thought I'd try a dialect. Just try. Start: "You don't even want kids." - You don't even want kids. - Theoretically, no. - It does not work. - It was just an idea. Once again, when you're ready. Theoretically, I - but as part of you, as an expression of our love - I want it more than anything else. But if we don't have children, it doesn't hurt either - because we still have each other. Our love is no less perfect. This is already almost perfect. This is an important monologue, Nimnh. - This is the crux of the story. - I cried when I read this. Good girl. When you are ready. As I approach the day I see or don't see a version of myself - the longing within me takes on an almost physical form. Morning sickness due to infertility and deficiency. When I see a young mother, I feel joy and despair. I don't know why women have such a deep need to create life - why they long for the comfort of their own flesh and blood. But I know they miss. Feeling that many women with children - never experience. Woman's deep grief - and the fear that children will never get a life. Well done. You've really reached the right mood. We need to talk. Sam wants his hands back. - It's mine. - Is not. We bought it. - I haven't written the final scene. - Someone's writing. I'll kill you. This is my life. - Is the wife a problem? - Take it easy. Sam. Listen. You have written something wonderful that needs to be shown to people. It's your art and you have to suffer for it. That's just the way it is. - You don't realize. It's worse. - Lucy understands. You are a writer. I'm not! I am a plagiarist and a thief. I am the worst villain of what is. That woman's voice. I didn't invent it, I stole it. - How did you "steal"? - It's Lucyn. Lucyko wrote it? Kind of. I read his diary. It was on display. I could not resist the temptation. That's even worse. You have to tell him. It will not work now. Because of the treatment, her hormones are mixed up. He is hypersensitive. I'll tell him soon. When I know how the story ends. Well. I hope your fitness is good, the journey is long. Now we have arrived. Please visit here. Just jump on it, spawn off and pull this to your neck. Back a little sincere, but the doctor needs to get access. Now we need your input, Sammy. Deposit here like this. I say when the checkout is free. I'll see you soon. An uplifting little garment. Suitable for premiere. What premiere? What do you mean? For any premiere. Take it easy. It was a joke. Now to the men's room. Seize Partner, fist mambo begins. - I will not make this happen. - Let's try something. I know you don't like Carl, but this is an important scene. Tell me how you see it in your mind. - Ewan? - Not now. This is an important moment for Colin. A lot is at stake. His wife, who he really loves a lot - has gone through six weeks of humiliating treatment. The ovaries weigh swollen and make it sore. He has traveled through London to queue with others - that his most private part is being invaded. Because she desperately wants to have a baby. Yeah yeah. If her husband does not ejaculate successfully - all his troubles have been in vain. These pressures on his shoulders - Colin has to sit alone in the room - and to do his duty to his beloved wife. Alright. Of course we can't show him handjob - so you have to express everything without words. Just like that. Brilliant. Keep that look. Action. The white dot on the screen is the needle. I place it next to the follicle. Now it's bursting. We remove the fluid that becomes the egg. Like so. Few can see the image itself as three cells in size. Maybe these don't get either. Let's give Dick and Debbie positive energy. - Dick and Debbie? - That's what I call them. - Is that a good idea? - They are fertilized embryos. This is already a big step for us. We have made a lot of progress. But the chance is one in five. I know, but the 20 percent chance isn't bad. Just think. They were alive when these pictures were taken. The two lives we have created. They just have to last a few more days. They just have to persevere. Share it, Dick and Debbie. Share it, Dick and Debbie. Well, girls, let 's practice now. Training! Well. The back is pricked and the vaginal needle is in place. Hopefully, they will realize what I have done for them. - One day you may tell. - The chance is one in five. Your child would be one in a million. When it's all over and this gets a happy ending - I want to talk with you. I love you, Sam. - Okay, that's great. - Everything is going to be alright. Everything will be fine. It has to. May I have Sam Bell. I'm his wife. This is important. Where is he? Let's start with the picture from behind Rachel. Try to highlight his vulnerability. Let's describe it now. No jaa... An uplifting little garment. Suitable for premiere. Sorry. No, that was good. Next - comes a really touching moment. A half-crazy, emotionally disturbed woman - jokes even though his heart breaks. A close-up of this is taken. Listen, Nimnh - this scene culminates his drift into madness. Trust Sam's script. A doomed attempt to remain a mentally healthy woman. Beatrix Potter and Winnie the Pooh fantasies. Sometimes he prays. She is considering having sex on the character's penis. Her sex life is a series of clinical performances. Sam, you shit too! Heartless pig! I have a menstrual period. We failed. They are gone. Of course, don't be embarrassed, however, he will tell you soon. - What is happening here? - Ask him. He tells. - You have used everything! - Sorry - - but we should film. - Lucy? Don't come near me. You read my diary. You stole my thoughts. You don't have to read this in a diary: I hate you! More than I can imagine! I don't want to meet you and I will never talk to you again. Lucy... I hope you looked closely. That is the intensity we are seeking. Listen, Lucy. You overreact to failure. I was going to tell. Let me explain. - I really hate you. - Don't do this. You read my diary. I wanted to have your children. I do not want anymore! Good thing Dick and Debbie died. I didn't see Sam for a long time, I didn't even apply for a divorce. I was a little crazy. I even had a relationship with Carl Phipps. It could have changed my life. - Are you nervous? - A little. You rarely get a premiere that you have written yourself. Sam is noble when you share it with me. You are gorgeous. Catherine Walker's haute couture is so wonderful. What you said on the phone... I'm not going to oblige you to do anything if it turns out... Lucy dear, don't think about it. I will do my duty. I am damn excited. It's just a surprise. You said you couldn't... That's what I thought, but now it looks like - maybe I can. And it's wonderful. It's... It's really great. Come lets go. Shall we? You've been dreaming since this little boy. Good thing you came. I would have been pathetic with William. - I don't mind Melinda, do you? - No, we'll meet him there. I read your new script. It's good. All too. Do you miss him so much? Stupid question. This is going to be a fun evening. The nude seizures were wonderful. We Celts are passionate. - I hated every second. - That's a hit movie! Of course, my people have talked to the Bond people - but I want to jump bungee jumps with a Peruvian tribe. Don't get me wrong. The movie was good. I deserved worse. God, those Englishmen are strenuous! - You look dazzling. - You look like Rasputin. Great movie, Sam. - You wrote the best pieces. - Don't go crazy. I identified four replicas. It 's your movie. You would be proud. It wasn't worth it. I learn a lot. I wish you had told me about your feelings. It would be nice to meet and chat. William misses you. I do not know. Maybe someday. All right, William. At the ready? Now! We already agreed on this. Ulise. Ulise, pöhkö koira. Ulysses! Come on, Sam. Lucy! Please listen. Love is not love Which always changes shape No, it's a fixed star Which never slips Every walker is guided I am in the park tomorrow. And every day. Thanks a lot. You were great. - You look wonderful, like a dream. - Do not say that. No worries. I know. Sheila said. You are expecting a baby. He shouldn't have told. It is at an early stage. I haven't seen a doctor. I'm going today. That is great news. You deserve it more than any woman I know. Of course I would like to list Phipps. I am jealous. Carl doesn't want a baby. He doesn't even want a relationship. And I don't want to be with him. I am happy, but I did not want it this way. Too bad we don't... Anyway, goodbye, Sam. Hi then, William. Come back, Lucy. Please. I made a stupid mistake, and I've regretted it ever since. - Please come back. - We can't just keep going. Especially if I'm expecting another man's baby. I will grow it. I'll take care of it. - I am the father of it. - You don't even want your own children. You live for writing. Isn't that supposed to change? I said I was going to father it. If I have to suffer a lifetime - can't I suffer with you - Is that a replica of your hand? - No. Or in fact it is. But I still mean it. Please. You have to shave that beard. Should not have been excited about the result of the home test. After all, it says it could be wrong. But the doctor said you could be pregnant. Possibly for a while. But not anymore. What do we do now? We've only tried it once. There is nothing wrong with us. So I suggest that - we love each other - completely and unreservedly for the rest of our lives - beautiful day by day. And they tried... And tried... And tried. - Where is that fertility symbol? - On a hill in Dorset. Do I drive a highway or follow power lines? Maybe yet?
