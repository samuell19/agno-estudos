- This is De'Andre, say hi, baby. Look at that smile. I love my baby boy with all my heart and all my soul. He wasn't brought into this world to be chased by no white police, or to be shot and chased down like no goddamned dog either. He also wasn't made to be in nobody's prison. I love my baby, don't fuck with mine. You're so perfect. Robert get over here. - I'm really happy you came to De'Andre's birthday party. I wouldn't have missed it for anything. - I just hope they turn out to be best friends. - Me too, I have a feeling that they will. - Long as you don't go moving out the city on me. - It's not in the plans, I'm in school right now working hard on my nursing degree. You know, something I can always make money doing. - Long as you don't go moving to like, Lancaster or Vegas. - Girl, I'm not moving to no hot ass desert or the South, that's out. You see my baby right over there, little Robert, he don't fit in into nobody's South. - Soon Robert and De'Andre gon' be little men. I just wanna be able to support him. - People be moving to the hood for low-cost rent. If it's too good to be true-- - I rather work two jobs and do what I gotta do than to have my boy end up in that trap. That endless trap that his daddy is going through. - I know what you mean. - It's like that man license being taking away for child support, I ain't even tell on him. With early convictions to get you into the system early and lightning fast. I wanna avoid all of that. - I be doing the same. Working, not selling my pussy for a few lousy dollars. I can't do it. - Hallelujah, 'cause we damn sure better than that. - A lot better. What's up with your girl? I heard she a striper now and can't keep that shit out her nose. - She's all right, she is my friend. Okay. - I mean, you really think she wanna be doing that stripping shit? She hate it, she just feel like she gotta do what she gotta do. - She need to check in somebody school, you did. - School is not for everybody, Angel. - Hoes need to pick up a book and get they reading levels up. - What's wrong Ebony? - Nothing much. I have goals, I fell like I got pregnant too soon, I know my child needs his daddy. That's something I know. I have so many things I wanna do. I wanna be rich and I'm not talking pay check to pay check neither. - That's what's up Ebony. So just promise you not gon' move out of LA on me. I promise girl. - Dear God, please grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change. Give me the courage to accept the things I can and the wisdom to know the differences.

Do you know why? - Why? - Because black men and their sons are the most incarcerated people on this planet. We incarcerate more black men than Africa at the height of apartheid.
