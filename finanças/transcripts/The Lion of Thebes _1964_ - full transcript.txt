Nikusor sync 22 centuries before the birth of Christ: in the 10th year of the Trojan War. After 3,500 days of siege, The Greek army has finally defeated the city's heroic resistance. Troy burned down completely and its inhabitants were killed All this for a woman: ELENA. Poets and historians have described this story of which, Even today, the world remembers it But very few know what Elena's fate was when, after the destruction of Troy, fell at the mercy of her legitimate husband Menelaus, king of Sparta. Some poets from the time of Homer and anonymous chroniclers 4,000 years ago, they gave time the legend of her life. This story is taken from those ancient documents, And it's not lost in memory yet. Near the Egyptian coast, a thunderstorm caused the Spartan fleet to sink on its return from Troy ... Arian ... Where are we? We're safe, Elena! THE LION OF THEBA Translation and adaptation: Cristian 82 Added lines, text and diacritical marks: d'Artagnan Let's stop here ... I can't go on. You have to try to move on, Elena. We could be near a city or on a caravan route. You will see that the gods will help us. The water! The water! I can't go on, Arian. It would have been better ... if he had died in the wreck, like Menelaus, and the others. Please ... leave me here. I can't go on, save yourself! Elena! Elena, I beg you! You have to try to move on. We will be safe soon. I know that! Elena, private! Down there, it's an oasis! Where? I see palm trees in front of us! And where there are trees, there will be water! I'm dying for seven! Where's the oasis? I don't know. He seemed to be in front of us, but now I don't see her. It must have been a mirage, Elena. Come after me! Wine! Rescue Me! Rescue Me! Elena, what happened? Arian, what's with these flames? You have to turn them off. The city is on fire! Help! Save yourself! The Greeks are behind the palace. Save yourself, Elena! Stop it! Back! This is Elena, the queen of Sparta. Our queen! She was your queen ... But that was 10 years ago. From now on, I want you to remember it as a living symbol. of the glorious victory of the Greeks over the Trojans! Yes, it's been 10 years since then, Elena. The passage of time has left no mark on your face. but you betrayed your homeland ... and your king. You have to pay for the betrayal, Elena. It's time to pay for your sins ... but not with your life, no! Get her out of here! Money! Elena! They will bring us some money! We'd better find out what the others think. A woman like that would be worth 100 talents in the slave market! Even double the amount. She will bring us her weight in gold! Do you think so? And he? It seems to me that he is a warrior. It's over. And besides, he's sleeping. One shot, we're taking him out of the game. All right! No sense in telling you now - I don't wanna ruin the suprise. Elena! Elena! Elena! If anything happens, run to the horses. Thebes is threatened by a great danger. The entire army is in danger of being surrounded and destroyed. The armistice I made with Menophis, will expire soon. Yusuf's army, took advantage of the armistice to improve and strengthen its military position, by supplying weapons and troops brought from abroad, while we ... We have learned to sleep with the illusion that we can withstand an attack by enemy forces, by strengthening the walls of Thebes. This is crazy. We can't stand a siege. Do you want to witness the destruction of our city? When looting and destroying our homes? I admire your rhetoric, Tutmes, but I do not accept criticism of my methods. I let you talk, because we are relatives. I know you're a brave general, but you look like my other generals. You only dream of military glory and honor. We will not win this war if we remain hidden in the city, but only if we anticipate everything and attack the enemy by surprise. A wise leader should know how to be patient, And act smart. Now mi-e team√£ the Menophis. He's too old. He will never have the strength or the ability to win a war. Listen to me, Ramses! You 're still the leader of Thebes, but if you don't let me fight my strategy, it won't be long before you lose your throne, And we will kneel before Menophis. Enough, Tutmes! I have neither the time nor the patience to get along with you now. His so-called state affairs. A marriage with a woman he doesn't even love to make him an heir who will never lead Thebes! I call on you, Jesus. Your wisdom and intellect it can help Pharaoh to change his mind. A great pharaoh needs no advice. I think you know how proud and ambitious Menophis is. Today, he rules Lower Egypt, but tomorrow ... In the plain of Thebes, he will unite the two kingdoms into one. The weakness of Ramses will bring the destruction of our kingdom. We must unite now. No one has the right to think and oppose the plans of the great Pharaoh. You seem to forget that he is Pharaoh, by the will of the god Amun, which guides and inspires their decisions And gestures. Your Highness, look at the beauty of this gem. There is no other like it in the whole world. Such a crown can only belong to the future queen of Egypt. If you like it, take it. Is beautiful! I'll wear it for you when we get married! Excuse me, Your Highness! What happened, Sinai? A strange woman, a stranger, insists on being received by you. Who is the woman? Refuse to talk to anyone other than Your Highness. He claims to be a queen and more than that, he insists that she is Elena, the queen of Sparta! Very funny! I hope you received it with all the honors it deserves. Did you hear that, Nais? We should rejoice and receive the beautiful Helen of Troy! I think he's completely insane. Go get rid of her. Wait a minute, Sinai! Why get rid of it? Get it! It could be funny! If you enjoy! Send her here. I warn you, Mom! If Elena of Troy turns out to be beautiful , will I fall in love with her? If it's really Elena, watch out for Ramses. It is said that her beauty brought bad luck to many men! Gods guide you, Ramses! You may find it strange that I appeared like this, but it's even weirder that I made it to your palace. Don't you expect me to believe your incredible story? Even if I know your unusual beauty, she is more than worthy of Elena of Troy! I'm Elena from Troy. The wife of the king of Sparta! You forgot that Elena lives in Troy, And that Menelaus has been under siege for many years? Will you still lie to me? Too mint now, Ramses. The war is over, and Troy was utterly destroyed. We were returning to Sparta when a violent storm destroyed our ship. And ea! And Elena! Your Highness, I swear I'm not mistaken. I've been to Priam's court many times, I sold her a lot of jewelry! The ring the queen wears on her fingers is the one I sold her! - Are you sure about that? "As confident as you are Pharaoh!" Your story seems unbelievable. Can you identify this man? Yes, I think it's ... It's Rouh, the merchant! Elena of Troy, Welcome to my kingdom! And please forgive me, I was so stupid to doubt you. - You've already been forgiven! "Leave us alone!" Let's all go! You are not, Jesus! Who is this man? It's Arian, a Greek prince! She fought with my husband for years. I owe him. Then he has all my respect! Strange... on your way to Sparta ... and your ship sank on the coast of Africa! Did Menelaus plan to pay us a visit to Egypt? No, I don't think so. Then what are you looking for on the coast of Egypt? Menelaus never revealed his plans to me. And you who fought with him for many years ... didn't you know what your king's plans were? I don't think he had any plans other than to return to Sparta. Forgive me, these questions have tired you out. I will make sure you have a well-deserved rest. Princess Nais will arrange everything. With pleasure! I'll take you to your room. You will need new clothes. These clothes are not worthy of a queen. I am grateful to you. But I want to ask you something. I would like to be accompanied to Sparta as soon as possible. I will fulfill your wish, whatever the repercussions. If Menelaus were still alive ... I would envy him. Now that I've seen how beautiful she is, I understand why the Trojans have lost all hope in battle. Oh, you are my guest! I offer you my hospitality too! All my servants are at your service. This is a necklace that matches the color of your eyes! Listen! Rumors of your beauty have reached us. My beauty only brought me bad luck! May the gods be glorified, for I was fortunate enough to find refuge in Egypt. Elena! Pharaoh is here! No Please! Please stay! Get out! I see I'm at the right time. I wanted to show you my most precious jewelry, You can choose the one you prefer. Your hospitality is more valuable than any piece of jewelry. You confuse me! You're not Elena, the daughter of Zeus and the most beautiful woman in the world? Please don't deprive me of the joy of putting a necklace around your neck. Listen to me, Ramses! Please! Say it and I will fulfill your wish! I can't afford to give orders to a pharaoh. I am a sincere woman, like many others And I'm grateful for what you've done. Will you allow me to return to Sparta as soon as possible? It's the only wish I want you to fulfill. I will fulfill your wish, as I promised you! But my kingdom is in great danger. I'm afraid the roads are unsafe, And if war breaks out, it is not known what will happen. For now, it would be wiser to stay here. I assure you you'll have everything you want ... as long as you stay here. I see you're not at all calm. That you are not satisfied! But you will, I'm sure of it. How dare you get in here? Guards! Arrest this naughty slave! Let him go, right away! Arian, he's not a slave. She will stay with me, as she has always done. As long as I want. I speak as queen of Sparta, and that is not a wish. It's an order! I'll do as you wish! It is a flagrant violation of our tradition, as a foreigner to wear the costume reserved for the queen of Egypt. Maybe our wise Pharaoh, He wants to be kind to her and make her our ally. Humanitarian policy is the power of Egypt! Elena, I'm giving you this necklace in honor of your beauty. The gemstones are joined by three rings. The first means loyalty. Second, friendship. And the third, love. It is said that the one who wears it it will be tied for the rest of your life to the one who offers it! And a beautiful gift, but I can't accept it. But why? Are you afraid that you will compromise? Please forgive me, but I can't accept this gift. Ramses, I think it's impossible to offer. I think you are aware that this necklace is part of the treasure of our country, It can only be worn by the queen of Egypt! And what makes you think that Elena will not become our queen? Let me retire to my room. It seems that my presence is neither necessary nor appropriate. Sure, if that's what you want. You are free to leave. Let's continue the party. Let the gladiators be brought! A beautiful golden vessel, offered by Pharaoh, will be the prize of the winner. The gladiator who will be able to throw his opponent into the pool, by any means, he will be the winner of the prize offered by Pharaoh. Where am I? Here, master. If the Spartan accepts the challenge, you know what to do. Yes, step. Gour! Here you go! You are a born fighter! Is there anyone among us who can measure up to Gour's power? I have heard that the Spartans are undefeated in battle. Is that true, Arian? I am willing to give the winner as a prize something that I value very much! This valuable dagger ... which once belonged to the "Lion of Thebes". Maybe Arian is a Spartan who prefers to be cautious rather than brave. You're wrong! I gladly accept! All right! If you win, you will also receive the title of "Lion of Thebes". He was the greatest warrior in our city. You took a big risk, Arian. Please forgive me! Take this, it's yours! Long live the "Lion of Thebes"! Long live the "Lion of Thebes"! Long live the "Lion of Thebes" ...! Long live the "Lion of Thebes"! Long live the "Lion of Thebes"! Believe me, Nais, no one in this palace He's not as worried about you as I am. I appreciate your anger and hatred for Elena! I am grateful to you, but I wonder how you want to help me. I cannot lead the heart of Pharaoh, But I can give you some good advice on how to get it back. I'm afraid you came too late! Elena will be the queen of Egypt! She will not be queen! Are you going to kill her? You know Ramses won't be able to forgive her death, but you can provoke her ... insult her, to prove to the whole court that you claim the right to the throne. E¬∫ti o prin√æes√£ And Pharaoh's cousin, don't forget that! Elena is there ... in the garden. Take advantage of this opportunity. Du-te, Nais. Want... I trust that when you return, you will be calmer. Then I'll tell you ... what to do. Want! Good thing we're meeting here! "Are you serious?" - Normal. And I hope there will be no resentment between us. Get out! I'm listening to you! Nais, not as an enemy! Then what are you to me? I was invited here, As a guest who sought refuge in a disaster. You came to take my rightful place. - You don't understand. - This is the truth! You want to become the queen of Thebes. Now...! I just want peace of mind! I don't think you'll find that here. I swear I'll make your life impossible! If you have this power ... Why don't you use it to help me leave the palace right away? Do you really want to leave? Yes rightaway! It is impossible! Pharaoh will never let you go. Elena! Ramses, I want to talk to you. Please trust me ... Nais! Did this woman upset you? Nais is not to blame because he loves you. I want to get rid of her love. And I tell you that your behavior towards her is indescribable in words. Guards! Leave us alone! Why do I see contempt in your eyes? Didn't I try to give you what all women ask for? I didn't ask you that, and I won't do it. I just want freedom and you stole this right from me. Your spies are following me everywhere, and you put Arian's life in danger. Arian, the man you should hate. I see I'm not wrong! You really love him. I had my destiny ... and he has all my respect. My heart has not felt any other feelings for some time. But your crown has been taken away ... And I'm ready to give you another one. Give me hope And I will give you all my love ... And my kingdom! I'm asking you one thing. Let me go. You promised me. The gods are my witnesses. Whether you like it or not, you'll stay here! I'm willing to wait. Wait a minute, Ramses! You're playing with death! We will never be able to escape. I'm going to think of something. We are under surveillance. They will kill you! Not even Ramses's guards will stop me. We must try to gain time. It shouldn't be hard for me to keep Pharaoh busy. Ramses is a tyrant. His word is law. He feels that he is a god and that everything is possible for him! great My trouble is not over yet. How many people have ... betrayed ... plotted and killed for me? My beauty! How many times have I had the opportunity to be comforted ... ... it never brought me any happiness. Don't let that upset you, Elena. I remember the first day you came to Sparta. As a queen, you shone like the sun. I was one of your bodyguards. There were 300... And I swore to protect you as the most valuable gift from the gods. I fought for you for 10 years ... I wiped the imposing city of Troy from the face of the earth . Secretly, you were our pride, everyone's pride. My comrades died happy for you They took the image of your beauty with them to the grave! Elena! Good, Money! The gods are playing with our fate, But why did they decide to stay with me alone ? Why, Elena? I don't know, Arian. All I know is ... I'm grateful to you! I love you! Elena, I love you! Jesus! You've finally arrived. You're late. All roads are guarded by Tutmes' soldiers. The search for spies continues. Have you been seen by anyone? No, but we have to be very careful. Tutmes doesn't trust anyone! That's the message from Menophis. Read it! You will see, you will be surprised by the content! We're lucky he's still on our side. Menophis finally got the help he was waiting for. Why do you think he lied, Elena? Elena is trustworthy. He doesn't know the truth. Are you going to tell him the truth? That would be too dangerous. Let's go! It's time to dump her and move on. I'm sure you understand what needs to be done. - Now it's your turn. - Agree. But what is your interest? Saving Thebes. A war is imminent, And Ramses is not aware of that at all. You need to get ready to act by tonight at the latest. I trust you. And don't forget! Nobody needs to know about our little date. What do you want? My mistress sent me to you. - Who is? "You'll know when I take you to her." Listen, I don't like mysteries. What is it about? It's about a stranger. - Elena? - Yes! My mistress wants to help her. I don't know more! Come with me. Trust me! Come on, only! Follow me. You can come in. Want? Why did you wake me up in the middle of the night? You'll find out soon. Sit next to me. I want you to give me an explanation ... and right away. You are not very kind, although I have called you to give you freedom, to you ... to Elena! Listen to me, okay. I can give you a chance to get out of here, but will Elena want that? He wouldn't like anything more. Good luck otherwise... I would have ordered her killed! You may have noticed that life is not very important here. Enough with this nonsense. Tell me, how can you help me? There is a secret passage leading from the palace to beyond the city walls. What if it's a trap? I'm going to announce my marriage to Ramses, And in order to regain my place with him, Elena must disappear from Thebes. Very well! We have to take risks, we have to trust you. I'll arrange to talk to Elena right away. When do we need to be ready? You'll have plenty of time to warn her. And don't forget! Come as soon as possible! You? What are you doing here? I will release you on one condition. I warn you, Ramses, it's dangerous to force my hand. Pharaoh of Egypt is not afraid of a woman's threats. We have to get out of here. Take me from here! We will soon be away from this place. Please don't cry. It's not worth crying that he's dead. Whose death are you talking about? Why are you trying to deny it, Elena? I saw his body. Now Ramses can't hurt us anymore . - Ramses? Dead? "Weren't you with him a few moments ago?" Yes. They told me you were detained and that you would be killed if I did not wait for him. When I realized it was a trap, I managed to escape. But he was alive then. It doesn't matter who killed him. Come over! Let's get out of here right away. Where's your dagger? I lost it... ... in Nais' room. - Want? - Yes! She is the one who helps us escape. Let's go. I'll explain later. Around here! Don't tell Nais about Ramses. Maybe he knows more than we do. Quiet! There she is! You have finally arrived! Listen to this! Ramses must have discovered that you ran away. The palace guards will be coming after you soon. Hurry up, follow me! Look with your own eyes, And decide who is to blame for this heinous crime! This is the dagger which our pharaoh offered to Arian. It is clear that the killers are the two strangers. The gates of the palace should be closed immediately! The guilty must not escape the punishment of the god Amon, And our justice. You two come with me! I want to have the pleasure of catching them myself! Follow me! To reach the exit, you need to follow these signs. The snake's head will show you where to go. Thanks Nais, I get it! But what will happen after we get out of here? No need to worry. At the exit, someone will be waiting for you with some horses, which will accompany you to the caravan route. I will never forget what you did for us. Around here! That's the way it is. Do not be scared! Quiet! Wine! Where are Elena and Arian? I don't know, I haven't seen them. It should be at the palace. Not! They ran And you know that, because you helped them escape. - Not! Not true. - Yes. Nais, they just killed Ramses! Ramses? Our pharaoh was stabbed to death with Arian's dagger! That's impossible! Arian forgot his dagger here. And where is he? A dispƒÅrrut! Then someone must have taken it. Do you know if anyone came in here? - Yes. - Who? Tutmes! He came immediately after Arian left. Tutmes...? Of course ... Now I understand why the alarm went off, without even looking at Ramses' body. Then I think you already know about it. All I knew was that Arian had forgotten his dagger in your room. but I didn't know who ... took it. Mothers! You are in danger of death. You are the only witness who can expose him. He's going to try to kill you. Come with me. I'll find you a safe hiding place, please! I may need you soon . It's awful! I fell into a trap! Around here! Quick! Stop them! Not! Not! Arian, help me! You will pay for your murder with your life. Get her out of here! Not! Not! Arian, help me! You will be locked up here for the rest of your life! Slave ... spartan! Tebani! Take it easy! Tutmes, the rightful heir to the throne, will speak to you! Tebani! I have gathered some indisputable evidence against the stranger who has soiled her hands with the blood of a terrible crime. The killer is Elena from Sparta! Now listen to me! I, Tutmes, I solemnly swear that justice will be done. Throw that sword, Arian! I know neither you nor Elena You did not assassinate our Pharaoh ... I came here to help you. I don't understand. I'll help you get out of these caves. I will give you clothes, and my men will bring you out of Thebes. but only one condition. What's this? Go to Menophis' camp immediately. His troops are now commanded by Menelaus. - Menelau? - Give... him! He managed to escape and reach the city of Sais. He is now in command of Menophis' army . I know what you're thinking. You fought bravely and suffered for Elena, and now ... You will have to give up your love for her. You see, Arian, for a great love like yours, It takes sacrifices, and sometimes ... even giving up. Elena's life ... is really in your hands. I, at this moment, I can't do much for her. I get it. Let's go! Wine! Tebani! Menophis' army is about to attack our holy city. Get ready for war! Our invincible Pharaoh Tutmes, it is now under the command of the army. This is Tutmes' plan of attack. Take it to Menophis, and don't forget ... that every hour of delay can be fatal to Elena. Don't worry, I won't waste my time. But you, why are you doing all this? Because I'm a bone to the bone And I want the one who fights for a just cause to win. The only legitimate pharaoh ... is Menophis, And I have always been a loyal servant. Now, leave! May the god Amon protect you! There is not the slightest doubt about the guilt of the woman here. He committed an heinous and premeditated crime, And I will show you that in order to carry out his crime, The killer managed to get the help of two accomplices, Arian ¬∫i Nais. The first got the murder weapon. Nais, he tried to help them escape, revealing to them the location of the secret passage under the royal palace. Today we have ... one of the assassins here ... ... in front of us, because of our intelligence And the lightning spirit with which Tutmes acted. There were many factors that led to this heinous crime. The fact that Elena was above suspicion ... And the fact that he gained Pharaoh's trust from the beginning. But also the convenient location of the apartment ... where the woman lived. The killer had to go through only one door. Elena went through the door with a dagger in her hand. I have the real proof in my hand that Elena is guilty. Arian's dagger! Elena of Sparta, Do you have anything to say in your defense? I'm innocent! But if you want me to die, I'll show you how a queen dies And a spartan! Let me in! I have to go in! - Tutmes! - What will you have? "You will have bad news, great Pharaoh." "Let him pass!" Talk about rubbing salt in my wounds - d'oh! The army loyal to Menophis is in the desert and is preparing to attack the city. I am under the command of Menelaus, king of Sparta! Menelau? Yes. The pact has been violated And the army is protesting against your leadership. What an impressive story. You were sent to Thebes, not just as a survivor of the shipwreck. but as a spy! Menelaus and Menophis sent you here on a mission to discourage Ramses not to start a war, or to flatter him. or to reveal our military secrets, And finally ... kill him. Arian's escape coincides with the assassination of our pharaoh, And in violation of the covenant. It is the most conclusive proof of her guilt. I ask you to judge her on behalf of the Theban people, And find her guilty of murder! I ask that Elena be executed as cruelly as possible. To be crushed alive among the huge stones. This is the punishment reserved for traitors ... And the assassins! Vorbe¬∫te, Xesostus ... In your capacity as a bishop, he pronounces a just sentence! M√£ opun! Do you dare to defend this woman? Of course, justice appears. Neither Elena nor Arian murdered Ramses, and I have proof! Aleph! Bring Nais! Pe Nais? Do you think they will have something interesting to tell us? Yes! The name of the real killer! I doubt it. Talk about rubbing salt in my wounds - d'oh! Don't be afraid ... ... Tell us everything you know. Traitor! G√£rzi! He is in charge of Menelaus and Menophis in arranging the plot. And he's the one who helped Arian escape. Arrest the traitor! Take her to the execution site ... Make sure that the sentence is carried out immediately. From this moment on, they take full power And I swear that Ramses' death will be avenged! I will destroy him and wipe Menophis off the face of the earth. And all his allies! We'll see if Pharaoh will believe everything you told me. This man claims to have an important message for Pharaoh. - It comes from Thebes! - Wait here! Remember well! If you lie to me, The horses will have a hearty dinner tonight ! You can come in! Where is that message that you claim you have? Read it! E trimis de Xesostus! If this is to be believed, it would be of major importance. Do you suspect me? It says here that you are a Spartan. - Is that so? - Yes. "Are you coming from Thebes?" - The message proves it. Were you a soldier in Menelaus' army? I was his lieutenant. I imagine they should know you very well. We'll see! Not! Stay here all! Pharaoh Menophis! What's up now, Menophis? I don't talk about battle plans while I'm eating! Go ahead, now! Who is this? What he wants? It's spartan! I think you should recognize him! All the gods! I think you're kidding me! Money! Come on! Eat something with me! Take a seat! Almighty Zeus! Who would have thought !? Your Arian just brought us a message that is very important, And we will decide the moment of what we have to do. What nonsense is the old man still telling? You, a messenger? From where, from the grave? Drink this! Drink! Why don't you open your mouth? Did you shut up? Elena is alive! That woman has 70 lives. Not even the deepest waters can kill her! Where is it? "In Thebes!" - Why is he in Thebes? After the ship sank we were found in the desert by a caravan, then the pharaoh offered us shelter! It's normal. Ramses has always had a weakness for beautiful women. Ramses is dead. 3 days ago. - He was murdered! - Was he murdered? Of whom? I don't know! But Elena and I were charged with murder. I managed to escape, but Elena is still a prisoner. This does not matter. We'll release her soon! But we must act immediately. It is impossible. But she can be killed at any moment. I came to ask you a favor. I know you have an army at your disposal. We must go to Thebes immediately! That would be crazy! I made my war plan, and I can't change it. Menophis is an incompetent and grumpy old man, and I appreciate his generals even less than he does. I am the commander and you will see that everything will go the way I want. Listen to me, Arian! You know that Menophis sent grain to the Spartan people While we were engaged in battle against the walls of Troy, But I decided not to pay a debt to change the course of the ship to come to Egypt. I can tell you this because you, personally, were my most loyal soldier. The only thing that interests me is the treasure of the pharaohs. And when I conquer Thebes, if you fight with me again, It will be child's play to eliminate Menophis. Talk about treasures ... while Elena is in danger. It's not my fault he got involved in another disaster. It's not the first time, and I don't think it will be the last! I'm wrong ... Or did this woman turn the invincible Arian into a fighter? I thought you were my king too! You bastard! Money! Maybe you need time to think. You have until tomorrow morning. If you decline the offer to ally with me, I will inform Menophis that you have come as a spy for the Thebans. You can go! What will you have, Menophis? Here is the message of Jesus with Tutmes' war plans. How are you going to save Elena? I'll leave it to fate! Maybe we can get there in time. There's something else you don't know. I have received reports that the Theban army has already left the city. Then we'd better get ready to leave immediately. We'll be in the Gw Alum Valley tomorrow. Our attack will take Tutmes by surprise! - Everything is going according to our plan! - It's my plan. In two days we will enter Thebes. Stop it! We are too far from our lands. Cursed be this deceitful wilderness. The distance is misleading! There! Look! The god Amon! Quick! There is no time to lose. It's Menophis' army. Tutmes must be informed. We need to get back to our camp. On horses! We have until tonight to reach the Gw Alum Valley. Let's go! Let me pass. I have news for Tutmes. What happened? Menophis' army was seen near the Gw Alum Valley. Gw Alum? How can this be? I saw them with my own eyes. He's trying to surprise us. It is clear that a traitor told them our plans. Our only alternative is to attack them by surprise. Immediate! That's the alarm! Take your weapons! We are under attack! Take up your positions! To Gw Alum! Before! Stop it! Back to camp! Forward to Thebes! Tutmes, the battle is lost. We'd better retire immediately. I will not give up Thebes without fighting! Call the withdrawal! Back to our camp! Retreat! - We have to follow them. - It's time to mobilize! Thebes should not be difficult to conquer! We must not give them time to mobilize. Attack them! Before! In a few minutes, the effect of the drug will disappear. Start running when she is conscious. Pharaoh wants to be aware during the execution. Keep going! Who are you? Arian! Arian! Before! Before! Hit her in the middle. We have to get in. With power! With power! Faster! Faster! Grabi√æi-va! Grabi√æi-va! Take everything to the tunnel! Hurry up! Gather everything! Grabi√æi-va! After me! If you kill me ... Elena will die too. This is a threat that means nothing to me, Tutmes. Where's the treasure? Tell me, if you care about your life! Where's the treasure? I'll tell you ... but on one condition. Yes. I promise you freedom, but speak up! Is there! In the sanctuary of the Pharaohs. I'll take you there! I can find my own way. Now she's mine. It's all mine. Money! - Elena ... - Where is she? You can't hear her ... She's in the death room. There is no time. Save her! Go fast! Elena! Money! Arian, be careful! Money ... Money ... Oh, Arian ... I missed you! Like the blind man who wants light. As I see it, you are both determined. Yes, Menophis. Elena and I thank you for the offer, but we want to be free to go where we want. We decided to leave immediately. What a shame! A woman like Elena, It would be the most valuable jewel in the kingdom of Egypt. What do my advisers have to say? Elena, she's the best queen And there can be nothing but a queen. You're wrong Menophis. For the first time in my life, I do what I want to do. To be a simple woman. And a happy one! I wish this with all my heart! Nobody wants to change the end of this story which ends so beautifully. I don't want to either. I am too weak and tired to measure my strength with the "Lion of Thebes." Translation and adaptation: Cristian 82 Nikusor sync Added lines, text and diacritical marks: d'Artagnan S F √Ç R ¬™ I T
