(engine purring) - [Voiceover] Where they going? Why they backing up so much? - [Voiceover] Hey, forget it, let's start without 'em. - You know, it would embarrass him to even race against a girl? Let's do it. - Yeah? Okay, great.

Go, we got 'em, go, go - [Voiceover] Keep your hands on the wheel. - They're coming up, got 'em, we got 'em. - Keep you eye on the road. - God, man, I just wanted to see. - keep your eye on the road. I'll tell you where they are. - All right, all right. - [Voiceover] Watch where ya going you almost bottomed out over there. - [Voiceover] Would you look out? - [Voiceover] Whoa! Oh! - All right, all right, good, good. - Come on, come on, they're coming, come on. Got 'em. - Right there, now, man. I let 'em gain on us. I just let 'em gain on us. Oh my god, it's a girl! - What is-- - We're racing a girl. - Come on, we can't let 'em beat us, come on, now. - Punch it. - [Voiceover] Oh no, I'm-- - [Voiceover] Oh, watch it, oh no. - [Voiceover] How could you let a girl get in front? Come on, come on, get 'em, we can't let a girl beat us. Keep your hands on the wheel, let's go. - [Voiceover] I can't let a girl beat us. We'll never be able to go back and face everybody. - Come on, come on, man. Get 'er on the inside, get 'er on the inside. - [Voiceover] Oh, we're going up. - [Voiceover] Come on, give it more gas. - [Voiceover] I got it floored already, man, come on. - [Voiceover] Turn right here, we got 'er right on the inside. - You just keep your eye on the road. I'm watching. - Whoa! Almost lost the car, whoa. - You be careful, you're gonna drop your tranny and your old man's gonna go wild. - What are you my mother, come on. (the cougars groaning) - [Voiceover] What are you doing? Oh no. Look out, man, oh man. - I can't believe you did this. You see what she did, man, she cut me off. - Hey hey, come on, man, what you just did? - I couldn't help it. - She's all the way down there. What you just did? I can't believe I can't trust you, where did they go,, down there? - Hey, I wasn't the one who challenged them, you did. "Hey, I'm gonna take you on." - That was a girl driving - I'm the one who's driving. - Own that bitch. You did it, I don't believe it, I don't believe it. - [Vicki] I knew I could. - We're really stupid, man. We really are stupid. (upbeat music) - You know, football class is really fun. Cutest guys are always coming to see Coach Walker. - Brian is really gonna be surprised when he find out how much I know about the game. - Hey, Gina, what's with all the bananas? - I'm practicing something. I read about it in a book. - Whatever it is, it looks fattening. (laughing) Hi, Brian. You hear about Jimmy's party? - Oh, yeah, but I'm doing something else that night. - Oh, like what? - Hey, girl's football, what a joke. I mean, the coach should just have you watch me in action and then you'd see what football's about. - Yeah, we're good for beginners. I mean, I can tackle a guy. Vicki's great, the coach said so. - Right, our next quarterback. - Brian, why can't we-- - Pete, let's cut class and go watch the girls play football. - [Pete] Yeah, okay, that'll be fun. - Bye, you moron. (indistinct chatter) - Brian! - Susan, hey, hey, hey, hey, wait. Susan, a public place? - What's the matter? What are you acting like that for? You sure liked me Saturday night. - Oh, Susan, come on, I like you. - Yeah? - Yeah, yeah, I'll see you later, all right? You're really good, later, Pete. - See ya. - See ya. - What in the heck where you doing with him? Now, Susan, I never twisted your arm to go with me. Now, if you don't wanna see me anymore, just be honest and say so. - Joe, I don't wanna see you anymore - So, you got a game Friday night? - I got an exercise game this year. (indistinct chatter) - [Voiceover] But he's playing another girl. - Oh, no, listen I got an extra size for you. - Press together really hard. - Hey, Gina, how you get this on? Here, catch. - Oh, god, football, how yucky. I hate these classes. - Oh, damn, how did I get stuck with this thing? Why did those girls have to do this to me? - Isn't it great having classes with Coach Walker? - Stupid Board of Education. Why did they have to do this to me, why? - Just 'cause you and Brian are going steady, you know, not all the of us are lucky. - What are you doing in here? - I'm just looking. - Yeah, we know, we know. Look what we found. - What was he doing? - Well, hello. Get over there. Honey, come on. - Why'd they have to stick me with these girls? (girls giggling) Goddamn it! Where are they? (boy groaning) I'm gonna get them out of there, if it's the last thing I do. (indistinct chatter) Out on the field, now! Now, you throw your full weight on that man. - All right! - Pay attention. What a waste of time. Your bodies aren't made for this game and your minds aren't either. Now, where was I? - You said we should throw ourselves on a guy, right? - Ah, no, I meant the player you're tackling. (girls laughing) Let's line up. A-squad in front. B-squad, ten spaces back. (whistle) - You gotta be kidding. - Ready on the numbers. - One - One. - One. - Two. - One. - Three. - That's Joanne, Marilyn, Vicki, Michelle, and Betty. - That's not Betty, is it? - That's Betty, all right. Remember I would know. - Man, how you manage to get all these chicks is a mystery to me. - Oh, it's easy, they can't resist me 'cause I'm wonderful. - [Coach] Come on, move it out there. Andrews, what are you doing there? Straighten that out. Andrews, they're not all that difficult. Come on over there, come on, let's go. Gotta work, get around there, break them up. Come on, girls, shake it up. - 14, 15, 16, 17, 18-- - [Coach] Come on, let's go, let's go. Come on, Andrews, don't turn around with those. Come on, move, let's go. Let's go wide like you were in costume. All right, Jackson, you're really moving your arms there. - 21, 22, 23-- - Come on, Andrews, get on with it, come on. - Girls shouldn't even be out here. - All right, take a knee. Okay, I'm gonna show you how to tackle. This is very important. If you don't know how... Jackson, stand up, pay attention. Now, this is a shoulder. (girls laughing) Now, if you don't use this properly and you don't know how to tackle, you can't win football games. You take this shoulder and you hit 'em hard and hit fast and you grab 'em around the side, you see the-- (girls laughing) Will you stop that laughing? Come on, Andrews, shape up. All right and now, for instance, if you tackle me... Oh, come on. - Look at the coach. - Come on, stand up. Give me my hat. Come on, cut it out. You girls drive me crazy. - I must tell you, I came back with the greatest recipe for a ratatouille provencal - I heard that she's got an new boyfriend and he still gets into hospitals. - That has 30 or 40 ingredients in it, but it's the most-- - It's, excuse me, it's quiet. I'll go back there to check on 'em. - Okay, dear. - [Voiceover] I wanna dance, I mean, really. - [Voiceover] Put some music on. - Look, wait a second, I'll go outside and wait by the door, when she come down and goes back upstairs again, I'll come out and tell you. - Real punch. - This party's boring. - The kids are having a marvelous time and they're so well-behaved. - The coast is clear. So, it's party time, let's go. (people cheering) (indistinct chatter) - Wait, not so fast. - Yo, can I get a deuce? - You want a deuce in here? - Woo! - All right. - You don't even know what the party's about, it's Jimmy's seventeenth birthday. (slow music) - Is he going on to college? - Of course he is, he has all kind of aspirations about writing, very creative guy. You remember when he was a little shaver. - You know these parents that complain about their kids and the pot, I don't know, we're very lucky and I think we can take credit for it because when we were young, we were brought up right and now, it's showing with our kids. - Get that lamp, please. - I remember when I was 16, I had a party and that's how we behaved. - Why not? Nobody's gonna know. - I just don't think we should. (knocking) - Is anybody in there? - Don't pay attention, she'll go away. (knocking) - Somebody's in here. - Come on. - No, I mean, someone could walk in here. - We'll be quiet. - [Voiceover] What, oh, wait is this? What are you doing? - [Boy] You love it, don't give me that. - [Girl] Real hot stuff. - [Boy] You're not the only one who thinks so, you know? - [Girl] Come on! - [Boy] You want this body. - Okay. Not this. Okay. (knocking) - Hey, can you hurry up in there? I have to go. - We'll be right out. I'll be right out. - [Girl] Wait a minute, okay, I'll do it.. - I don't, I mean it's okay, come on. - I got the cake, everyone, turn on the light. - Hey! - All right. - Come on, Bill. - What's going on? - Come on, this is your chance. * Happy birthday to you - Sometimes when I hear him talk, I can't believe he's only 17. * Happy birthday, dear Jim. - You know, at 17, he really knows so much. (cheering and clapping) - He's such a remarkable kid. (laughter) - And I'm awfully proud of him. (upbeat music) - It gives me no pleasure at all to tell you that last week's quiz was a disaster. I feel that we should do better work in this class than we are doing. Today, we are going to be studying the civilization of an ancient... - Mitchell, Mitchell. - Mitchell, smoking is not allowed in this class or anywhere on the school grounds and you know that, please. - Yeah, yeah. - That was it. (laughter) - It's out. - Now, the study of ancient Greece is very important to our understanding of the rise of our own western civilization. This map clearly shows the relationship of Greece to the eastern cres-- (snapping) To the eastern crescent which was a land of the Phoenicians. Now, then, I am sure from last week lesson, you are aware of the many contributions to our society that can be traced directly to the Phoenicians. What was the major contribution of the Phoenicians? Come now, I'm sure someone must remember that. Robert, Robert! - Yeah, yeah. - What was one of the major contributions of the Phoenicians to western civilization? Robert, stand up, we can't hear you, dear. - I forgot, I forgot. - Well, we're never gonna make any progress, if you forget everything the day after it's gone over here in class. Obviously, you're not studying in this class. Now, if we are to learn anything about western civilization, it is very, very important-- - Oh, I smell smoke. - Oh, oh, oh! - Ms Arganon to the rescue! - I want everybody to stay calm. I want everybody to stay calm, here. - You're doing a good job. - No, I want everybody to remain in their seat. So, everybody please be seated until the fire is out. - It's a fire, man. - Somebody, please help. Does anyone know how to open this? Will somebody please, will somebody please? - All right, Pete, the man. (clapping and cheering) - [Voiceover] Man, that natural fireman. All right, a natural fireman. (bell ringing) (indistinct murmuring) - Breath like you wouldn't believe, I mean, bad breath. - How come people close their eyes when they kiss? - To keep from going blind. - Really? - No, she's just kidding. - I'm not, it's bad for your eyes. - Hey, you wanna stop for a soda? - No, I'm gonna wait here for Brian. - Okay. - I wish I had someone to wait for. Hey, wait for me. - [Brian] You bit me. - [Girl] Oh, that was nice. Let's do it again. - [Brian] You wanna do it again? - [Girl] Yeah. - So, this Saturday night? - What about it? - Hey, I can do it standing up, sitting down, you name it, I can do it. - Well, it looks like we're gonna have to continue our conversation some other time. I'll see ya. - Oh, yeah, see ya later. - Who was that? - Vicki, hi. Okay. Listen, Why don't we go some place where we can be alone. - You really think I'm stupid, don't you? - Vicki, what's wrong? - What's wrong? We're supposed to be going steady, but you're not. - Come on, don't be that way. Look, you know I'm crazy about you. - Oh, Brian, you know, it's so stupid of me to believe you, but not anymore. Now, look, I don't need-- - Come on, don't be foolish. Oh, you've been listening to all those lies about me from your friends. - Brian, I don't have to listen to anybody. I can see for myself that you're screwing around and to think that I loved you. Well, I quit. - Listen, baby, nobody quits me. I do the quitting around here, let's get that straight. - Oh, yeah. Well, screw you, Brian. - Hey, what are you looking at? Want me to stomp your ass? (arcade buttons clicking) - Terri, can I ask you something? - Yeah, sure, go ahead. - What about sex? - What about it? What are you asking? - Well, I don't know. Everything, I guess. I don't know where to start. I mean, I'm flunking my sex-ed class. - What makes you think I know anything? - You won. - I won! You won it, you won! - I won! - I just saw Brian's car and don't mention Brian's name to me. - Oh-oh, you sound angry. - Brian is such a rotten, low-down, son of a-- - Oh, look who's here. - [Vicki] We've broken up. He's screwing around with every girl in sight. - That's not true, Vicki. He's not screwing around with me. - Hey, Vicki, hold up! Hey, Brian wants to talk to you - Screw Brian! Say his name one more time and I'm gonna roll this right through your neck. - [Boy] Vicki, listen, I don't know what's happened between you and Brian, but-- - [Vicki] I am warning you just cut it out. - Somebody's tickling me. No, no, somebody's ripping me off. Vicki, please, let me go. - Oh, the big bad Cougars. So, this is what you guys do when you're not playing? - We're only kidding, man. Come on, no harm done. - Yeah, we weren't gonna keep the things. We're just joking, you know? - Yeah, yeah. Well, just to make sure you don't shortchange him, empty your pockets into here. Come on, dish up. - All right, man, all right. - There's enough to get home, huh? - Come on, those five dollars is mine. - What's this? - I mean, these are my Trojans. I need these. - Put 'em in his pocket. - Aw, come on, man, I need 'em. Besides, one of them is used anyway. - Used? - Yeah, I'm sentimental. - Man, take this crap and get lost, all right. - You think you're bad, don't ya? We'll see you on the field. - Yeah, man, first game's coming up soon. - Vicki, he's the one you're angry with, not me, please? - He better not try to say one word to me. - Look, all guys screw around, guys are like that. Brian's captain of the team. I wouldn't give up a guy like that. - [Gina] I wouldn't give up any guy. (somber music) - You're disgusting. What are you selling homemade hepatitis? - Oh, man, you are always on the rag, you know that? Here, have a rag, huh? Well, I got moves. Sexual Astrology, Jesus. - What in the hell is going on here? What the hell is this? What is this? - What's going on? He's a pig, he's disgusting. - Man, I took a shower today. - Just get outta here. Get outta here. I don't even want you, you pig. - Me? She did it! - [Boss] Get outta here! - Wait a minute. - Get outta here. Get the hell outta here, go on. - All right, I'm going, I don't need you and you know what, I know about you two. That's right, I know about you two. - I'll give you a wave about this. - You're an idiot. (murmurs) - Little boys with dark hair and blue eyes really turn me on. I'll help you. - [Brian] Pete! - Hey! - Damn, man! Bet you smell like this when you get home. - So, what? I got 240 bucks saved already. Pretty soon you'll be eating my dust in the road. - With grease, I wouldn't go near dust if I were you. - Want a burger? I can put one on the grill. - Yeah, me eat something you cooked? Yeah, I know you don't wash your hands. - What about a beer then? - What, you sell beer here? - No, but the boss has a private stock. We can down a couple and I'll replace 'em when I go for lunch. - Go for lunch? - I don't eat here either. - Yeah, I'll take you up on that, Peter. - Baby blue eyes, you should drink milk, get those strong teeth. - [Brian] Vicki, is really busting my chops. - [Pete] Yeah, girls can sure be a pain. - Oh, you telling me. When it comes to girls, you gotta keep 'em guessing, keep 'em on a defensive, and never tell one you love her 'cause that's when all your troubles begin. I'm telling you from experience, man. - Pete, I've had it with you, again now. This is the last time. The dishes you're breaking, you're costing me every day. You know, those are eight cents a piece. - I'm sorry. - You're sorry? I'm sorry! What good are you? You cost me more than you're worth. You're just nothing, I'd rather do it myself. Do you understand? You're stupid! - I'm sorry. - I'm sorry... Watch yourself. (groovy music) - You know that job is really getting to me. My boss is such an asshole and he's always yelling at me. No matter what I do, nothing's right. - Look, you gotta straighten yourself out, you got a bad attitude. - I want the job, I gotta keep the job. - Hang in there, you almost got enough money for that car. Before you know it, you'll actually have the car and more girls after you than you'll know what to do with. - I hope so. - Come on, let's ride around. Let's see if we can find anything. - I tell ya, I'm not gonna be here much longer. - And where ya gonna go? - Well, as soon as I... As soon as I make enough money, I'm going to Hollywood. - Hollywood? - Yeah! - Why ya gonna go to Hollywood? - 'Cause I'm gonna be a star. - You're gonna be a star? - Yes! I have a lot of talent. I just don't have enough money. One of these days you're gonna pick up one of these magazines and you're gonna see me. Just like any of these people except I'm better than they are. - Why would you wanna be in one of these magazines? - 'Cause I don't wanna be doing this the rest of my life. - Are you gonna do this the rest of your life? - No, are you kidding? - What ya gonna do the rest of your life? - I don't know. - Vicki, it's crazy! - What do you wanna be on the football team for? Football isn't for girls. - Nobody is going to talk me out of it - You're just-- - I've made up my mind! - You're just doing it because of Brian. - No, I'm not. Well, yes I am, but only because I want Brian to recognize me as an individual. That's why I'm trying out for the boy's football team. - [Terri] Fine, come on. - Absolutely not, never, let's not play jokes like this. - But Coach Walker, I'm not joking. I just wanna try out for the team. - Do me a favor, go away. - But don't I have the right to try out for the team? - Look, if you keep up this nonsense, I'm going to send you to the principal's office. - That's okay, I'll go there on my own. (whistle) - What? - But I'm serious, I just wanna try out for the team. I've taken the class all last Spring and Coach Walker said that I was a better kicker than most of the junior varsity team. - Football is brutal. - I'm in good shape. - Yes, you're in excellent shape, but every semester, boys break their arms and they break their legs and they lose their teeth and-- - I know, but I'd still like to try out. - Look, why don't we just forget about this and you go back to class? I mean, why on earth would you wanna play football? - Why would anyone wanna play? - What would your parents say? - Dad doesn't like the idea, but he says that as a lawyer, he'll defend my right to try out. - Oh, well, really? You don't know what a mess you're causing. Dismissed. - So, you'll allow me to try out for the team? - We'll see what the school attorney has to say about that, dismissed. - Yes, sir. - Get me the school attorney. (indistinct chatter) - Gentleman! You will notice that we have a young lady among us. - Yeah, all right. - This is Victoria Mason who for legal reasons has been given practice status on our team. - What! She's a girl! - Girl on the football team? The other teams will think we're faggots. I quit! - Hold on, all of you. Sit down. I'll have no quitting here. I'm sure Victoria will soon agree that this is no place for a girl. - How we gonna play with a chick around here, coach? - [Voiceover] Yeah, it's a man's game. - A guy could never get practice status that easy. I mean, we had to work for it. - Yeah, work for three months. - Keep your broads out of our game. - Hey, sit down a minute! Cut it out! Gentlemen, please! - Come on, man, I had nothing to do with it. - We have to give her status to keep our funding. She has us by the, oh, let's watch our language. - Shit! - Practice on Monday immediately after school. - Vicki, I don't know what you're trying to do, but-- - Look, Brian, I have nothing to say to you. - Vicki, quit. Like right now, go in there and tell him you're gonna quit. - Like why should I? - 'Cause I said so. - Yeah, see you at practice. Hey! - Vicki! - Hey, come on, just leave me, leave me alone. - What are you doing? Stay out of this. - You just leave her alone. - Get your damn hands off of me. (boy groans) - All right, yeah! - Hey, come on, man. - Get off of him! (indistinct yelling) - Hey! Get up! I don't know what this is about nor do I care to know, but let this happen again and you're both off the team, I mean that! Now, let's clear out of here. - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 2, 3, 4. - [Voiceover] Set hut one, hut two. (screams) - She actually came to practice. I can't believe it. - Yeah, this'll be her first and last day, though. She'll never make it through this. I got nothing against you, just quit. It gets rough out here. (whistle) - That's all for today. - Good workout. (vicki breathing heavily) Hey, that was really some workout, huh? - Yeah, is it always like this? - No, sometimes it's worse. Everybody's surprised that you're holding up through this. - I'm sure. - Well, it is a little strange for a girl to be trying out for the football team. Especially when her boyfriend's captain. - He's not my boyfriend anymore. - Sorry, I didn't mean to pry. - It's okay. - Hey, you know, you're really not a bad kicker. Pretty lousy when it comes to receiving, though. - I need more practice. - Maybe one Saturday we can get together and I'll throw you a few. - Oh, wow, that would be great. - I gotta get going. I'll see you tomorrow. - Okay. - Bye. - Yo! What were you doing talking to that girl, Vicki, after practice? - We don't want a girl on the team, right? - Yeah. - Well, I know how to get her off. - Let's put it this way, she's Brian's girl and if he couldn't get her off the team, how can you? - Look, she's not Brian's girlfriend anymore. I'll get her off. - If you can do that, you'll be the most popular guy on the team. - I know how to deal with girls like that. - You really did that? - Gina, you shouldn't worry about it so much, practically everybody does it. - Even the principal does it. I guess most people do it. I'm still scared, I don't know what to do. - Do you have a date? - No, I just thought I should prepare myself. Vic. - [Vicki] Looks like it's time for us to go. - Hey, Vicky, I wanna talk to you. - Look Brian, I really don't think that there's anything for us to talk about. - So, that's it, huh? You never wore my ring. - I threw it away. - You what? You throw away my ring? And there I was being nice to you, letting you show the world that you're going, you threw away my ring? - Yeah, I did it a long time ago. - Let's just forget that I even thought we could get back together. Hey, you're not the only girl in my life. I'll see ya. - I wish I had guys like that after me. (upbeat music) - There he is. - Hey, don't get to close, man. Your face might spoil the food inside. - Hey, I'm getting sick and tired of your wise-cracks, man. - Yeah, me too. You know, I think I want some ice cream. Let me have a vanilla, please. - Hey, I wouldn't do that if I were you. You guys are so stupid, you might forget to swallow. - Oh, yeah, you try and stop me. Vanilla, please. - Two double strawberries, please. You like strawberry? - Calling you out, Jack. - Now, you gonna get it. - You know... You know, I'm a lover, like I mean, I'm not a fighter. I'm not into that I don't like violence thing, you know? - You all right? - Yeah, I got it. (boys groaning) - Give me another one. - Hey, wait a minute, who's gonna pay for all this? - Hey, break it up, come on. Come on, boys. Yeah, yeah, oh man, get up, turn around. 'Cause what the hell is going on here? Will you tell me what's going on? - Listen, no, we just playing. Playing, you call this playing? What's going on here? - Nothing. - Nothing? What are you fighting for? - A friend of mine. - This a friend of yours? - Yeah. - I want you to settle this difference outside off the property and if you can't settle it, I'll take care of all three of you with this, you understand? Do you get me? - It's all right, yeah. - Knock it off. - Get ya outside, Jack. (romantic music) - I was thinking that I hope that we keep seeing each other. And... that you... - Quit the team? Oh, you, too. Well... We can go on seeing each other, but I am not gonna quit the team. - That's just what I thought. You're stubborn. - Oh, I thought you said I was okay. - Yeah, stubborn and okay. - Be cool, man. Well, all right, cool. Got them suckers back. They have it now, Jack. - Let's see what we got. - Hey, get his shoe. Do you hear that? - Hold up. - What are you doing? Oh, that's beautiful. - Look at that. To think I flunked art, you know? It, oh man. Something wrong with you. Oh, cut that mother. - You think that's Brian's? - I don't know. - [Cougar] Yeah, it is. - Oh, yeah. - Hope it is. - Definitely ruin his image. - Yeah, I think he's gonna get the general idea. - [Cougar] Yeah, it's your style, man, just. - Oh, this sucker's gonna be in bad shape come Saturday. - I hope this guy likes to wear this shoe 'cause he ain't, he ain't getting it off. - He's gonna be slippin' and slidin' all over. - Oh, Jesus. - Hey, how's this look? - We definitely, definitely have talent. - Without a doubt, without a doubt. - Hi, Mrs. Mason, yeah, it's Brian Caldwell again. Yeah, is she there yet? Thank you. Vicki, now don't hang up, listen. Just give me a chance. I wanna work things out with you, okay? I just wanna talk, I just wanna see you. - Hey, girls, what's up, anything? - Nothing, otherwise, would we be sitting here? - Look at him, he's so cool. Be right back. - I'm never gonna learn. You and Terri won't tell me anything. - Stop worrying, it'll happen. - You always say that. - They're going to the drive-in, they got beer. Hey, real cool, you know what I mean? Mac will pay, too. - Where's Mac? - Oh, he's out in the Thunderbird. - He's so cute, I saw him in school. - I can't go, I'm in training. - For God's sake, Vicki! Please don't tell 'em you play football. If we're all crazy, we'll never get them. - You go ahead, I'm gonna go home. - Okay. - Oh, boy! I'm going out with Mac. - Come on, girl! - Woo! - [Voiceover] We will never forget. You cannot escape your destiny just as I cannot escape mine. - [Voiceover] What you say is very true. Very true, if only I had a way to get the power I seek out, I'd show those fools out there-- - Why don't you come a little closer? - Oh, Pete. - My name's Mac. - [Voiceover] Who caused the accidental trial which crippled you where you are now. - [Voiceover] Yes, yes. Yes, it's all clear now. - The hair, the hair. - [Voiceover] But what does this mean to you? - [Voiceover] I have in my possession-- - Hey, Gina, look who's over there. It's Vicki and Brian. Hey, come on, let's go over and have a few laughs. - Oh, come on, I think it's nice that Vicki and Brian got back together. Come on, don't spoil it. - [Voiceover] Had secretly buried a monster hoping to resume these experiments at a later date. He also was the man who discredited you for fear that you had knowledge of his work with the monster. - [Voiceover] When Groden returns, he will be-- - [Voiceover] Relax, doctor, I will give you orders and you will follow them. - Nice and hot. - You're so nice and warm. - [Voiceover] I think you will find that working with me will be the more intelligent decision, doctor. - [Voiceover] I cannot wait, I will help you now. - [Voiceover] Prepare your laboratory. - [Voiceover] Yes, and all those who would meddle in the destinies of Frankenstein and Dracula will see an infernal bloodbath the likes of which has not swept the Earth before! - Hey, sunshine, how you doing? - What, I, what happened? - You fell asleep during the second picture. - Oh my god, Brian, it's 7:30. Oh my god. - Vicki, where you going? - My father's gonna kill me. - Vicki! - I have to go and and call them or something. - Vicki! - Where's the telephone? - Wait a minute. - Where's the telephone? Brian, I gotta get to a telephone, wait. - Slow down, would ya? - No, I think there's one this way. No, Brian, I really have to go. - Come on, Vicki, slow down. What are you doing? - I don't even have enough to make a phone call. I have to call them, they're gonna be worried. - Hey, look, come on, I'll take you home. Come on, it's no big deal, I'll-- - Brian, then I have to go right now. I have to go right now, Brian. My parents are gonna kill me. My father's gonna be so angry with me, They're not gonna believe me - Give me five minutes. All right? five minutes. - Five minutes for what? - Well, we came here in a car, didn't we? - Yeah. - So, you fell asleep, come on, five minutes, we'll talk. - All right, I give up, what do you wanna talk about? - Come 'ere. - Why? What? - I've been thinking. - About what? - About you. - What about me? - I really missed you, Vicki. I thought about that time when I asked you to be my girl. - Your girl, Brian Caldwell's girl. All yours like your car. Only your car got a better deal. - Vicki, it's not like that. - No, it's not like that, not any more it isn't. Not gonna be. - Vicki. You're really special to me. - Oh, how many girls have you said that to this week? - To one, to you, and that's it. What do I have to do? What do I have to say? How can I get you to believe me? - I really don't know, Brian, I really don't know. - I wanna make it up to you, Vicki. - Well, first, I think you gotta make it up to yourself. - What do you mean? - Well, I mean, like maybe you should ask yourself why you do the things you do? Like why you gotta make it with all the girls and why you always gotta be so damn cool? - Look, Vicki, I'm really sorry for what I did. I know I hurt you and I know that's why you joined the team. - Oh, that's not why I joined the team. It's more than that. - [Brian] You did it to spite me and because you were hurt. - No, Brian. Listen, like when I first wanted to join the team, I was no longer Vicki Mason, I was a girl, a sex, not a person. No one was even interested in giving me a chance to prove myself and everyone, including you, didn't want me on the team just because I wasn't a guy, whether I deserve to be on the team or not. Well, that doesn't make sense to me, Brian, because I'm a person. And I hope you understand, you know, like not just for me, but for yourself. - Vicki, I want you and me to be close again. - It wouldn't be easy, Brian. - I know that. I wanna try again. - Do you really? - Yeah, yeah, I really wanna try. - Well, maybe, I'd be willing to try. - Well, I'm willing to try. - Well. Can you take me home now? (indistinct chatter) - Fellas, that was a good practice. - Oh, yeah, sure was. - Ah, mother, who did this? I'm gonna kill 'em. - What? Somebody put peanut butter in my cleats. - What's going on here? You know how much it cost to replace these things? - It's the Cougars, they're trying to break out spirit. - You think I put peanut butter in my own cleats? - Hey, we should get 'em. We go over there and even the score. - [Coach] You'll do nothing of the kind. Enough of this, we'll get 'em on a football field in an honest game. (funky music) - Hey, Frankie! - Hey, Brian. - How you doing, man? - So, what's this about peanut butter? - Yeah, can you handle that? - Hey, they never did that to us. - We gotta get him, man. This is Big Frank. Pete, my good buddy. - How you doing there, champ, good? - We gotta get em, man, you have any idea where they are? - Yeah, they're probably at the junkyard stripping down cars. I always see 'em when they're passing by. - Hey, Gina. - [Gina] Hi, Pete, what's up? - Oh, nothing much, just me and the guys, we're gonna teach the Cougars a lesson. - Can it on the noise. - What, I'm gonna wake somebody up? - Will you can it on the noise? - When we get through with 'em, you won't know them from the rest of the junkyard. - [Gina] The junkyard? - Well, of course, where else would you find the Cougars? - Is that a radio in the car? - Yeah. - Take it out. - All right. - Hey, you want the carburetor? - Yeah, we get about 10 bucks for it. - Yeah, if I can get it out. - Over there. Hey, that car over there, that's my car. - Oh, man, how'd they get it? - I sure don't know, but it's my car. I'd know it anywhere. I built it myself. - Yo. - What? - We get about 20 bucks for this. - [Cougar] All right. - That's my alternator you got there. - Who are you? - That's my alternator you're holding in that grubby hand of yours. - Yours? - Yeah, mine. - Nothing personal, you can have it back. - Hey, man, this is our territory, you know? Please, come on, man. - Put 'em down, put 'em down. - Here. My car, there's nothing left. They stripped it all, those guys, they took everything. (engine starts up) - No, all we wanna do is talk, right? - We don't wanna talk, all right talk to me? - Talk about kicking around. - All right, then, oh. - [Voiceover] No, man. - Brian. Hey, what are you guys doing? Brian, come 'ere, I wanna talk to you. Brian, can I talk to you? - Yeah, what are you doing? - Hey, come 'ere. - Vicki, what are you doing here? - Bobby, come 'ere, come 'ere. - [Gina] Peter. - What are you doing? - What are you doing, huh? - I don't know, we're just having some-- - I mean, come on, you could get hurt. And where would I be, huh? - Peter. - Look, you don't know what they did to us. - I don't care what they did to you. - What are you doing? Why didn't you stop this? You're all gonna get killed. - No, we're not, there's only two of them and there's six of us. - Oh, come on, Pete. - Vicki, I don't think this is any of your business. - If you don't stop this ridiculous fight, you're gonna be riding in your next car all by yourself. - Okay. - Hey, look, don't ever let it happen again. We're gonna let you go this time, but don't ever let it happen again, all right. - Brian, I don't know. - You're lucky if you ask me. - I mean it. - Don't ever let it happen again, ever. (upbeat music) - I didn't know it was his car. - God, me neither. (clanking) - Great, we're losing all the stuff. - Oh, now we gotta stop. - We can't stop. - Hey, hey, man, what do you want from us? We didn't do anything to you. - Okay, guys, what are you gonna do about my car? - We didn't know it was your car, man. - We didn't know nothing. - All I know is my car is now in bits and pieces and when I think about that I get very angry. - We'll make it up to you. - That's right, man, we will, I swear. - I don't see how except-- - Except what, just name it. - We'll do it, man, we'll do anything. - Anything? - Anything, I swear. - Well, the only thing you could do is to put my car back together the way you found it. - We'll put your car together like brand new, I swear. He swears, too, right? - I swear, I swear, man. - You can start by picking the stuff up off the road. What do you wanna do? Cause an accident or something? - You didn't tell me it was his car. - I didn't know it was his car, man. - Is he still walking behind us? - Yeah, he's still there, man. - Just keep walking. (cougars humming) (lively music) (whistle blowing) - Our first game's coming up on Saturday and I wanna make one thing clear, you're not playing that game or any other game, you understand me? - You mean, I'm not gonna-- - It annoys me like hell that you'll even be sitting there on that bench. You're not playing. - But Coach Walker, I have really-- - You and your father can take me to court, I don't care, you're not getting any further than that bench. - I thought you said I was a decent kicker. - I'll admit that, but that's only part of what this game is about. - Yeah, but I've been practicing on weekends, too. - I've been playing this game for over 35 years. I love it, the power, the force of it, it's a man's game, one of the few left. - Well, things are changing. - Eventually, somewhere, some of you will get in and then the changes will start. The equipment, the rule, the style, they'll still call it football, but it won't be this game. - You mean, after all the stuff I've done, I'm gonna be on the bench all season? - Either that or quit altogether. You're a fighter, I admire that, but I'm a fighter, too, young lady. All right, let's go. Come on, let's see it. (whistle blowing) (indistinct chatter) - Brian, I really wanna be in that game. - Oh, come on, Vicki, it's not such a big deal. You know, it's only a pre-season game. - No, I deserve to be on the team, I earned it. - You know, maybe you get to play in the next game, you know? - No, he said that I can play in any of the games and that his word was final. Oh, I don't know what to do. - Well... maybe I can talk to the coach. You know, I am the captain of the team and you know, I have say. - Yeah, but aren't you worried about what the guys are gonna say? - The guys? Hey, hey, hey, no, listen, I'm the captain and what I say counts and I'm not worried about what anybody thinks. I'll talk to the coach. (upbeat music) (telephone rings) Vicki? - Brian, where are you? Aren't you at the game? - Yeah, yeah, I'm at the field. It's gonna start in about 10 minutes. Listen, you still wanna play on the team? - Brian, are you kidding? - No, I'm serious. Listen Vic, here's your chance to prove what you've been trying to prove, only you gotta give something up in return. - What do you mean "give something?" - I talked to the coach and he agreed to let you play in this pre-season game against the Cougars, but after this you gotta quit. - Now, wait a minute, I'm not just-- - He won't let you play, otherwise. Listen Vic, you could be the first girl ever to play in a high school football team, now is that worth giving up something for? - All right. You tell that bastard it's a deal. Damn, I haven't got my car. It's at the mechanic and I'm here all alone. - Look, Vicki, if it's important enough to you, you'll get here, you know? I mean, you'll walk or you'll run or you'll hitchhike or whatever, but you'll get here, I'll see ya later. (engine purring) (indistinct chatter) All right, baby, hop in. We're gonna ride, we're gonna ride. - [Vicki] Excuse me, it says road closed. I don't have time to take a detour. - [Man] No, it's okay, it's a shortcut, just relax. - [Vicki] No, it's not all right, I'm really in a hurry. - It's okay, we got time, we got time. What's the hurry? Let's park here a while. - I really have to go. I'm in a football game, I'm-- - In a football game? - Yes. - A specialty kicker? - Yeah, thank you very-- - Oh, I got a specialty. Stay here. Stay here a while. - Thank you so much for the ride. - Oh, come on, hey! (indistinct chatter) * And away we go - Do you think that you can go a little faster? - Hey, what's what? - Could you go a little faster, please? - Past it, oh yeah, I'm past it now. - No, could you go a little bit faster? I'm in a hurry, I'm going to a football game. - Oh, had one, had one once, yes. - I'm playing on a football game. I have to get to-- - You're playing a football game? I knew when Joe Namath put on them panty hose that was about the end of it. Don't worry, you youth, always in a hurry. When you get to be as old as I am, why you'll find out that life is a race to nowhere. That's what you'll find out, yeah, sure. - Don't you know it's illegal to hitchhike in this city? - Yes, I do, but I'm on my way to a very important football game. - You can watch school football any time. - No, I'm not gonna watch it, I'm playing it, I'm the specialty kicker. - You're kidding? - No, we're playing against the Cougars. - The Cougars, they're a bunch of wise guys. I run those guy in to one thing or another all the time. Get in the car, get in. - Great, thanks. (lively music) (sirens blaring) Thanks a lot. - Good luck. - Say, isn't that a girl over there? - There's a girl over there. - So, let's win this game. - What number she wearing? - Let's get rolling. - Yeah! - [Voiceover] Hey, coach, you get him out. - Come on. Yeah, woo, yeah, they did it. (indistinct yelling) I'm gonna send the girl in. - Are you kidding, coach? - This may shake her up, embarrass her. Mason, come up here. Get in there and get that point. You wanted to play, now you're playing. - All right, yeah, okay, yeah. - I don't believe it. - I got something for ya. - Yeah, I got something for you, too. - I thought you said you threw it away. - I lied. - You're something else.
