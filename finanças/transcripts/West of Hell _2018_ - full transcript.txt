Next stop Atlanta! All aboard! Train departs in five minutes! Are you Annie Hargraves? Daughter of Stefan Hargraves? I don't know who that is. I have a bodyguard escorting me on this train ride. He's the best mercenary in Georgia. He'll be here any moment now, and he won't hesitate to blow your head off. I told you not to talk to strangers Annie. Annie, that's a lovely name. You look just like your father. I'm Jericho Whitfield. And why don't you head to the back of the train where you belong? Last call to Atlanta! Last call! You know what, okay I'll leave you nice people be. Doors are closing! Last call to Atlanta, last call! Doors are closing! I suggest you leave that package here too. And what if I don't? Well, I would say we have ourselves a situation. I'll say, that we do. Make a run for it. Best through the dining car. Now you listen up, you listen up real good. My name is Roland Bursley, once a rebel captain, now a mercenary. Now payday motivates me Jericho, that girl you're tracking, I don't care if she lives or dies, but the reason why we're in this scrimmage is because her daddy's paying me $500 to get her safely from here to Atlanta. Then you're in my way mercenary. Jericho Whitfield, is that your name right? It sho is. We can end this here and right now. You hop your ugly ass off this train. I won't follow you. I don't intend to lose that $500. Pays for that. Yeah, you just give me Annie Hargraves so I can scalp and kill her with this here knife. And then you can take me to the Atlanta authorities and collect your $1,000 bounty on my head. Roland, we got ourselves a bargain? Let me go, please. Just a minute. There you go Jericho, one Ms. Annie Hargraves, now remember, be quick about it. If I were you I'd step aside. Pleasure during business with you. Mm-hmm. I was bait. Yeah, now don't talk to me for the rest of the train ride all right. I'm here for a payday, not to have a conversation. Desi he's getting the floor awful dirty. Can you get a rag and clean that up? Yes Ms. Grace. They'll be a lot more blood to clean up after I break free. Shut up. We will keep him on this train 'til we get to Atlanta. And I will escort him safely to the cattle post. He will get a safe trial. Then you'll hang. Come on. Nah you, you stay. It's a bitter pill ain't it, living a slave. Come with us, I need eyes on Jericho. He ain't liable to hurt his own kind. Go. Sit. You sit too. Now, the bad news is, I'm not gonna kill you. The good news is, I'm gone be a thousand dollars richer when we get to Atlanta. Holler if he tries anything funny. I'm gonna be over here. Culture. I thought you had your bounty to worry about. Jericho ain't going nowhere. And what if he breaks free and shoots me dead? Then I guess I'll be 500 short. See you in Atlanta. Don't bother me. What's your name? Desdemona. A lovely name. I don't talk to crazy criminals. I'm simply a minister of justice to those who would have us in chains. We have the same scars. You should help me Desdemona. We're on the same side, look. Enough of you Mr. Jericho. How long did that white lady own you for? Grace's daddy owned me for 30 years. Grace owned me for three, but I'm a free woman now. She pays me a fair wage. You'll always be her slave. What are you doing with a little girl's corn husk doll? Who's is it Jericho? I told you not to bother me. I thought I told you to stay put. Thought you were in trouble. How did you expect to get me out of it? Ah. I have a deal that I'd like to propose to you Desdemona. Why would I strike a deal with you? Because I can give you something that you want. Untie me, let me go, let me finish what I came on this train to do. I can also throw in Ms. Grace for you. I'll scalp her and kill her, on your behalf. No blood on your hands. You'll never have to hang you head low again. Can you get a rag and clean that up. Desdemona shut your mouth, Desdemona shut your mouth. I won't let you kill Ms. Grace. And I won't be an accomplice to that poor Annie girl's murder. Well that's a damn shame Desi. I thought that we would make a good team. Now you're just a coward, standing in my way. Okay, I'm not gonna kill you, I'm not gonna kill you, it's just gonna me a little. Shit, I suggest you hide. That's my gun. You're not stopping me. Stay down mercenary. I see you Annie Hargraves. Let me tell you a story. Your daddy used to own me and my family. Myself, my wife, and my beloved daughter. He was feared throughout Atlanta, for scalping slaves who had the audacity to run away. One day we decided we had enough. And we staged a little rebellion of our own. Killed all the overseers, but yo daddy, he went out and he got some more men and put an end to that little rebellion party. I had to watch as my daughter was scalped and her bloody body was thrown into a muddy ditch. And from that moment on, I have scalped 48 slave owners and their next of kin. From the moment I saw my baby girl bleeding out in that ditch, I made a promise to myself, to find and scalp the first born of Master Stefan Hargraves. You have my daughter's eyes. Thought I took care of you. You know what, hold this. Father don't let them kill me. Father don't let them kill me. Father don't let them kill me. What the hell is that? Don't let them kill me Father. Don't let your guard down. When he comes back we'll be ready. Bad dream Father? Help me, there's something wrong. Why didn't you help me? Do something Mama. Do something Mama. Jericho won't scalp me, not as weak as I look. You ever used a blade? Once. You do it like this, hold it tight. Here, here, here. Strike one of those if you want to bleed a man out. If you kill me, you'll lose that $1,000 bounty on my live head. You're quite the mercenary Roland. Oh what, you gonna waste your bullet on little old me? Yeah why not? Because there might be something scarier than the both of us on this damn train. Something that can kill us before we can kill each other. Why don't we do some investigation together, shall we? Who are you? The other passengers need to see this. Go 'head, go ahead and get that chair there. You, sit. Who is that, I thought we were the only ones on this train. I'm staring at the face of a Yankee I killed in '62. This man has been dead for 10 years. But he don't look so dead now. What I want to know is, why? A Yankee, is that all I was to you Roland? So you came all this way, under the dirt and trails to just say hello. Hi. Did your coffin get uncomfortable for you? You know I didn't get no coffin. I didn't expect that. Sellah? You are not Sellah, I know you're not her. All I ever wanted Grace, was for you to call me your sister. She's got a nigger sister. I'm guessing her daddy had his way with Desi whenever he wanted, whether she wanted to or not. Left you with a precious little half sister. I cared about you Roland. Do something Mama. You're not my daughter. You're a monster. Help me. My daughter died eight years ago. Why didn't you help me? Be a good girl Annie Hargraves. You don't talk to her. I am not your good little girl! Get off me Roland, get off. Get outta here now! We're gonna make you talk. You look human, I'm gonna see if you die like one too. You let go of those chairs the ropes cut this trigger and this gun will blow your head clean off. The last guy I did this to, he lasted a good three minutes. How long you got? What are you? What the hell do you want with us? I'ma make this a little hard for you. Now you were saying? You could have spared me. I was your... I'm gonna ask you this one more time. What the hell are you? No Jericho, Jericho that ain't her, now just don't let her move. Get away from me! Oh no, I don't mean you any harm. I can't believe anything that comes out of your mouth Jericho. You're a monster. No, you didn't marry a monster, you married me. You took it too far. I just did what everybody else was too weak to do. You killed women and children, you're a monster, a monster. Shut up! Monster. What ever you think you're holding in that thing ain't her. Jericho, if you still love me you'll let me go. No, Jericho, Jericho it ain't your wife. Get your hands off my wife. Get away from her! Jericho, Jericho what are you doing? I didn't know you were so soft. To find that Jericho Whitfield turned you into a blubbering mess over a bitch who didn't even want him anyway. You're pathetic. You're not who you look like are you? What are you? You the devil? I work for him. You don't even have anyone, hell you don't even love. They're be nobody to mourn for you at your funeral. Hell there won't even be a funeral. You just as soon as killed that girl for $500 as well as protect her. Well do you enjoy it, working for the devil? I didn't at first. But you grow to enjoy the power over people. You're a mercenary Roland, that's all you'll ever be. What does it feel like? I can show you if you like. You're right about me, but we have to kill that thing. If you want to get off this train, we're gonna have to kill each other later. Get away from her. Can I get a moment of your time Father? What do you want from me Jericho? I saw my wife, she left me years ago when I became a killer. I just want to confess my sins. You're wondering who that was back there aren't you? The silver haired man, the shape shifter. No, you don't have to tell me nothing. My husband was murdered last month. Authorities said Indians killed him. So my father hired you to escort me home. My father looked all over the state for a suitable husband for me. The best match he found was a man from Delmar. Nathaniel Hickson. I moved into his house after the wedding. My father made me promise that I would try to make it work out. Then one night, he wanted me in his room. But I didn't want to, but he wouldn't back down. He told me to be a good girl. So I took a lamp and I smashed him in the back of the head. And when he was on the ground, I took a piece of glass and I cut his throat, ear to ear like a cow. Everybody on this train is wallowing in guilt. And all I can think about is getting my hands on Annie Hargraves scalp. Does that make me a sinner? People only confess their sins when they want to be redeemed. Is that what you want? Look at you, are you a new man with restored faith now? You mind if I have a word with Ms. Hargraves? And just so you know it, I won't be taking my eyes off you. If you go for the silver little knife of yours I will blow your brains out. I can scalp you and have my revenge or let you live and choose a noble path. I'd like to show you something. Whoa now, keep your hands where I can see 'em. It's not. Show me what you got there. You got a weapon in there? Move away from Annie. Let me take care of this Roland. You won't do what needs to be done. Is that right? Now you're gonna tell me what is in the bag. The reason I kill crackers like you. Oh hey, hey, it's okay. All right let go, you're wrinkling my suit. How are you still alive? Oh, oh. Sinners, when you boarded my train, you left the immortal world. You have arrived in my kingdom and entered into the life full of despair. Sinners, when you boarded my train, you are all dead, my train. You have reached my kingdom. Annie get back on the train. I wanted to see Hell for myself. What did a woman like you, do to be sent to Hell? I did nothing. Oh we all did something. Grace sold my daughter to a slave master, a cruel master. She was always jealous of Sellah. Well you should have strangled Grace then and there. I was too scared to stand up to her. Didn't say a thing. I was practically Grace's mama. I raised her since she was born. Coulda saved my girl. Her new master beat her 'til she died. And that day they sold her, Sellah begged me to save her. Convince Grace to let me stay Mama. But I was too afraid, that's why I'm damned. 'Cause I did nothing. Passengers, you can still choose your path. Pass like us and you can bargain with me for the fate of your soul. I won't be a sitting duck, I will not await damnation on that cursed train. Satan cannot judge me, I'm a man of God. Oh! No. I'm here for your pleasure, lover. I forgive you for what you did. I made you break your vows. Do you want to kill me? I tempted you. I understand. No, no, no! No! Welcome passengers, I wouldn't do that if I were you. Yeah, why not? You'll take your test, hell's armies will be on your side and make you cry, like the priest. The first test is simple. Choose whoever you want gone amongst the five of you. The person you believe most deserves damnation. Write it on this slip of paper. Whoever you have chosen will be taken away. Everyone else will go on to the next challenge. Everyone, write down Jericho. No, we each write our own names. That's the only way to make it fair. Shut your mouth Desdemona. Tell me, who has made the lives of every person on this train miserable? Who is the most vile and repulsive murderer on this train? Has hurt every last one of us. He's a rebellious slave who doesn't know his place. You are a disgusting, vile, mangy, nigger. Know your place girl. We will all write our own names. Everyone'll have a fighting chance. And that's the way it's gone be. Who will pick the name? I will. Desdemona. It says Desde... You thought she'd be redeemed? Or I shall say we're still not saving souls. You have no reason to be good. Split up into pairs of two, your next challenge awaits. I will ask you three questions, if you don't tell the truth you will experience pain worse than you could ever imagine. All right, ask away. Are you a good man? Nope. Who was the man you saw, the shape shifter? He was a Yankee soldier. I don't know who that shape shifter was, coulda been any man or anything. How did you know that Yankee soldier? I don't know. Roland, just tell the truth. Roland, tell me the truth. I don't know who he is. I don't know who he was. I'm not gonna tell 'em. Roland just talk. All right, I can do it. He was my brother Wesley. You, you killed your own brother? We were fighting for opposite sides. I was a rebel, he was fighting for the North. He cried for mercy. I didn't listen. You better get away from me Annie. It's nothing worse than killing your kin. Don't be like me. I'd rather be a killer than a whimpering victim like your brother. You did the right thing. The challenge is your choice. One of you must face the devil and then bargain for your soul. The other must face their past, and if you led a good life, you will forever regret your last days. Choose your paths, one the devil, one the past. Now I know you don't much like me Jericho but I think we should play this one fair and square. My past is safe, I never killed anybody. I'm not a murderer like you, whether you face the devil or your past Hell will have no mercy on your soul. I will face my past, I have nothing to fear. No! Now you will face the devil. You meeting the devil? When the devil summons us, we have to strike a deal. Do you think the devil's just gonna let us waltz back into earth, let us finish our final days in peace? It's called a bargain Roland? He's gonna want something from us. What do we have to offer? You're a mercenary, you're used to doing things people couldn't bear to do themselves. What about you? We can work together, do the devil's dirty work. I'd be good at it. We make a good team, don't you think? When you walk in there, you do not stick your neck out for me. 'Cause I'm sure as hell not gonna stick my neck out for you. That's fine. I can handle myself. You have a yearning to go back and make things right with your wife. I'm willing to let you go back. What do you want from me in return? I'd like you to walk to the next compartment and bring me Ms. Hargrave's scalp. That's what I'd like. And if you do, you can go back to your wife. Perhaps you can make things work out. If you don't bring me her scalp, you'll answer to the hammers of hell. Father don't let them do this to me. Don't let them kill me Father. Get away from me. I can't believe anything that comes out of your mouth Jericho. You're a monster. I made a promise to myself. I'd sooner stick this knife up your white ass. I ain't your slave. Not like this. Not like this. Master Stefan, not like this. Let her go. Your daughter will be scalped before your eyes, again and again and again for all eternity. I hear your amenable to making deals. You heard correctly. Let me and Roland go back to earth. And after I'm done living my life, I'll be your mercenary for the rest of eternity. If you go back to earth, you'll do it on my terms. You'll be a good girl Ms. Hargraves, a good girl. I had a different deal in mind. What's going on? Hold her down. Stop, let me go! Deal. You will live your full life on earth, he gets my soul, that's the deal. I go to Hell, you go back to Georgia, you live your life. No stop Roland, that's not what I want. I have to pay for my crimes, you still have a choice. A deal is a deal. Go through that door and choose life. It's on the other side. Go back to a life where you are weak. If you stay here, you can be my mercenary. You will hunt and torture the damned. You will be powerful, feared. Let her go Master Stefan. Make me your mercenary. I understand what you did. You did it for me. You're a good man. I will always protect you. ♪ Like I seen and heard an awful sight ♪ ♪ The lightening flashed and thunder rolled ♪ ♪ Around the doomed and bellowed souls ♪ We ride at the hour, prepare the train.
