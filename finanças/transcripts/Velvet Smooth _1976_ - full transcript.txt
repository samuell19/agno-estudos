(light funk music) (bells on door ringing) (bell ringing) - Just a minute! (bell ringing) All right. I'm coming, I'm coming. (intense orchestral music) (grunting) (man humming) - [Man] Thank you. (man humming) Eh, no! - One, two. Now run straight home. - Bye. - Bye. (grunting) (ominous orchestral music) - [Man] Here. - Done? - [Man] No sweat. Three up and three down. - [Man] Don't no sweat me, man. I want details. - [Man] No time now. Pretty heavy. - Right. - [Man] Ready for the big score. - [Man] I'll tell you when. - [Man] Okay. I've gotta split. - [Man] Just be handy when I need you. (knocking on door) (door buzzing) - Book, baby. I've got business. - Oh, King. - Come on, mama. Behave. - King. - Go ahead. Three good people got hurt today. We lost bread and slips. With this heat, we better pay the regulars who claimed they hit. - You're talking some big bucks, man. - No shit. This whole scene is costing. Can you dig it? - Hey, there's no line on them at all. - We don't even know who's behind it and where they're coming from. - I want answers, bro, and I want them fast. - We've been trying. - Trying, my ass. Trying don't mean shit. I pay big bucks for you to keep my territory running smooth. - They come out of nowhere. They hit hard. They hit fast. And then they split. - Ain't even any rumors on the street. - Let it be known how well we pay for information. - Calvin, change the routes, change the pick ups, and change the drops. - That's no small job. You think we can outrun them? - It can't hurt to throw a few curves. - If you can't protect the old routes, what are you going to do with the new ones? - Things have been cool for a long time. Then zap. All of a sudden, get ripped off all over town. Somebody wants this territory bad. - You don't think changing the routes will solve the problem, do you? - No, but it should buy us some time. Buy as much muscle as we need to protect our people. - We can't be at every newsstand and stor in town. - Cut the bullshit. Get out and do your job. Check in later with Calvin for the new routes. (door buzzing) - He's right, King. You'd need an army. - Then we'll get an army. - Well, who's gonna pay for the army, man? That's gonna bleed us, too. - This is the only way. Get out and figure out those new routes. (light funk music) (phone ringing) - [Velvet] This is Velvet Smooth.

The door's open. - Mm, mama. Looking at you sure makes business a pleasure. - Keep looking, baby. I get paid by the hour. Drink? - I could use one. - Word has it, you've got big troubles. - That's why I called. - I didn't figure this was a social call. I heard the newsstand was ripped apart. And Eddie got pretty beaten up today. - You don't miss a trick, do you? - That's a word I rarely use. My business is to know what's happening. - I'm getting up against the wall, mama. I'm being ripped off all over town. I mean, my whole organization is shaky. - You say the word, and I'm in. - I said the word when I called. - All the way? - I've got no choice. You name it. - I have to know every step of your operation, top to bottom, players, runners, bag man routes, the works. - You never needed that information before. - You never called me in on anything this big before. - Okay. Calvin will lay out the whole operation for you. - You got any ideas? - I'm blank. Whoever it is, is a stranger trying to move in. - And succeeding. - Right. - Is there anybody in your organization you don't trust? - It doesn't figure to be inside. We've got a good thing going for a long time. I don't screw my people, and they don't screw me. - Money and power do strange things to people. Don't discount anyone. You've been around too long to trust even your own mother. - But I'm trusting you, lady. - I'm on the case. How soon can I start looking at the operation? - Right now. Martinez is out making collections, and Calvin's back at the office coming up with the new routes. - You're covered, papa. Move out, bro. I've got work to do. - Call me, first thing. (phone ringing) - Hello. - [Velvet] I need you, right away. - Aww, you have to be kidding. - Get Frankie, too. - [Ria] Aww, come on. I have an exam tomorrow. - Hey, play lawyer some other time. This is really big. - Sounds heavy. I'll be right over. - I'm waiting on you. - Okay. I keep so busy I'm never going to get my homework done. Ah. (phone ringing) - Hello. Aww, shit. You're putting me on. It's after midnight. It's for you. - You're busting up a beautiful night, Ria. What's happening? Right on. I'm on my way. - Aww. - Sorry about that. - Aww, Frankie. Aww, shit. What am I supposed to do? Damn. (light funk music) - Mm, mama. Mm, mm. Woo whee, woo woo, mama. You're looking good. Oh, you got a sweet ass. - Right on. Right on. - [Man] Hey. - Do it, girl. All right. (light funk music) (knocking on door) - Hey, come on in. - [Ria] Hey. - You keep hitting those law book, Ria, and you'll be on the Supreme Court by next year. - We always wanted someone on the inside. - Mm-hmm. - Okay, Velvet. Fill me in. This sounds good. - Did you get Frankie? - Oh, yes. I certainly did. - Hmm. - She'll be here any minute. - Coffee? Help yourself. - Thank you. (knocking on door) - It's open, Frankie. Come on in. - Hey, what's happening? - Hey. - [Ria] Frankie, you made it. - No biggie. You interrupted Darren. (laughing) - King Lathrop was here. We've got big troubles. - That's no news. - We've been hired to pull him out. - That's big time action. - We're a big time crew. - Right. - Ria, King's accountant, Calvin Christopher, is waiting for you. I want you to go over King's operation piece by piece. If there's a dime in the wrong column, I want to know it. - What about people? - I'm hoping something will grab you by the way the whole thing is laid out. Frankie, Martinez is out making collections. Shadow him. Check out every move he makes. He should be leaving King's in about 15 minutes. Don't let him know you're there. - I'm cool, mama. I'll just go out and do my thing. - What are you doing, Velvet? - I'm going to head up to Mat's place. There's always information where the action is. - Don't bruise your knuckles on the craps table. - Tonight's all business. See you later. - Okay, bye. - Bye. (suspenseful orchestral music) (grunting) (light funk music) - Do you think anyone's holding out? - It's all there. Why don't you figure it out? - You know, you're really a pleasure to work with. - Hey, you're not here at my request. - Hey, I thought we were on the same side. - I don't need any help doing my job. - From the looks of things, if you don't get some help, you want have a job. - Well, King should be by muscles and not secretaries. - Hmm. You'd be amazed at my skills. Now let me see the new list of routes. - Nuh-uh. Nobody sees that. - Don't argue with me, Calvin, just do it. - I'm still working on that, but I should be finished by tomorrow if you feel like prying some more. - Hmm. Don't worry. I'll be back. - Not if I have anything to say about it. - I'm sure you won't. (phone ringing) - Hello. Yeah. Hold on, I'll be right with you. Excuse me, this is private. - Naturally. - Yeah, what's happening? Yeah, my guest just split. Oh, wow. They really blew it. They didn't even get the bread? I know that puts us behind schedule. Right. Yeah. I'll set that up right now. Right. (light funk music) - Hey, boy. You look good today. You wanna try one time? - [Dealer] No more bets. Lady coming up. Here we go, here we go. Number nine! Yeah, baby. - All right. All right. - [Dealer] All right. The lady's a big winner here. - That's nice. Thank you, boys. It's been a pleasure. How you doing? - Slow night. - Any new faces around? - Why? You looking for somebody special? - No one special. Just a few things happening I'd like to check out. - Yeah, well, why don't you check with Digger. He's over at the wheel. - [Velvet] Hey, look who's here. - Woo, I love it. Mama's here. - Hey, player, what's shaking? - Mean scene, mama. Mean scene. - Right, that's why I'm asking. - [Digger] You know there's some big goon dudes in town trying to make King into a pawn? - Any ideas? - Best kept secret in town, baby. - [Velvet] Notice any new faces around? - [Digger] No new faces. I'll give you a ring. - [Velvet] Give me a ring if you hear anything. - Any minute, baby. - Keep in touch, bro. - You know what I mean. - [Mat] Hey, baby. What a pleasant surprise. - Unfortunately, I'm working. - Working with my chips, as usual. - You gonna buy me a drink? - Sure, baby. Any time. I knew you were working. - Figures. - What's up? - I suppose you heard about King. Well, his problems are now my problems. - That's a hard corn, baby. Can I help? - Have you seen any strange dudes hanging around? Notice any unusual action on the street? - Everyone is getting a little edgy, but no one knows where it's coming from. - I know. All I've done is hit blank walls. No one seems to be holding out, but they just don't know. Well, off to the wars. - See you later? - Sure. I'll need a little R&R. (light funk music) (suspenseful orchestral music) - [Man] Listen, bitch. You listen good. If you don't drop King from your client list now, we're gonna drop you. Do you hear me, bitch? - Fuck you! - [Man] It's your last chance, ho. (grunting) (laughing) - Fuck you. (grunting) (grunting) (grunting) (grunting) (grunting) (grunting) (grunting) (grunting) - [Man] Get out of here. (grunting) (grunting) - Okay creep, who set me up? - I don't know, I don't know. Ow. I don't know! - Don't jive me, man. Who set me up? - It's all done by phone. I don't know who it is. - Don't hand me that shit. - It's the truth, man. I just got out the slammer. It was easy money. No questions asked. (grunts) - Oh? (grunts) - [Ria] Good night. - Unexpected visitors. Looks like open warfare. - On two fronts. Calvin really gave me a bad time. - That's strange. He did show you everything you needed, right? - Reluctantly. It was obvious King laid down the law to cooperate with me. And Calvin resented it. - Any reason for him to be uptight? - Everything was in the right place. It certainly looked legit. But he really seemed like he was trying to hide something. I don't know. He just sent off bad vibes. - Nothing you could grab onto, though, huh? - No. Not really. The only thing that wasn't complete were the new routes. But it figures he wouldn't have time to finish them. I think is going to queer our deal with King. - No sweat. King knows where it's at. (phone ringing) Hello? - Been trying to get you. Martinez is home free. He has no idea why, but he is. - What does that mean? - Uh, some heavy dudes backed him in a corner. I did a little cleanup job and his prayers were answered. - [Velvet] Are you okay? - Yeah. A little rough around the edges, but I'll survive. - Did you get a look at any faces? - Yeah, but they're not from around here. I didn't recognize any of them. Uh, Velvet, if nothing else is happening tonight, I have a very sick friend in bed. - Send him my regards. - All right. (knocking on door) - Good morning, mama. - How you doing, papa? Nice seeing ya. - Uh, Guess you had a busy night. - We all had our hands full. - I've got a fresh pot of coffee. Want some? - Sounds good. - [King] How you take it? - Anyway I can get it. (laughing) - King? - Not now, woman. I'm busy. - I can see that - "I can see that." - I guess you had your hands full, too. - I always try to keep busy. Come on. Fill me in. - I mixed things up pretty good last night. - Oh, really? I heard things are good at Mat's place. - So you had your own little detective agency working, huh? - Right. - Things were quiet at Matt's, but they got a little more interesting when I got home. - Okay. Lay it on me. - There was a welcoming party waiting. Five bad ass dudes. - Shit. - They were sent to warn me off. - By who? - That's the wild part. They didn't know who sent them, and their main man wasn't there. - Well, whoever he is, he really gets his info fast. (chuckling) - But in Frankie's case, not fast enough. You heard. - Martinez didn't know who it was. He described a female whirlwind. When Frankie stepped in, he put his ass in gear and ran. Is Frankie okay? - She's all right. That was a new route for Martinez, right? - You know it was. Top of the list. - Who else but Calvin knew the routes? - Me. And I guess, Ria. Hey, Velvet, what are you getting at? - Calvin played a very strange scene with Ria last night. - What do you mean, strange? - Maybe hostile's a better word. - You know he's a tight ass. He called me this morning after Ria left morning about us opening up for big trouble letting anybody know our system. - Ria felt it was more than that. - Hey, he's my man. He's been with me from the beginning. Listen, Velvet, we grew up in this thing together. Calvin does his thing, and this is the first time I've interfered. It figures he'd be uptight. - I don't know. It's just something. - Good, oh, Miss Smooth, good morning. - [King] Grab some coffee, bro. We're trying to figure last night. - I don't need any help. I can figure it out. - Oh, cut the shit. Velvet works for me. We're in this together, bro. - Yeah. We've done all right. We've come a long way together, without any broads nosing around our business. - Hey, brother. We're looking to help. We couldn't give one shit about the numbers game. - Hey, look, King. I don't care about Velvet working the streets or any place else she can help. She can't help my end, now keep her out. - Slow down, bro. - Look. It's got to be my way. Or maybe you don't trust me anymore. - Okay. You got it. Understand? - You make the rules, baby. It's your turf. - Now that that's settled, I can get to work. - Don't worry about Calvin. He's cool. (light funk music) - Take care. See you next week. - Hope you have a nice day. (suspenseful funk music) (grunting) (grunting) (grunting) (grunting) - Code 37. Requesting ambulance and assistance. (speaking foreign language) (siren wailing) - [Ramos] That's the route kid. That motherfucker, he needed to die. - All right, what's the kid doing here? (all chattering) Anyone see anything here? Who was the first one here? - [Girl] We were. - You were? - Yeah. - You didn't see anything? - No. - [Barnes] No witnesses, huh? - What happened? - I don't know. That's what I'm trying to find out. - [Officer] Back it up! - No one recognizes him? No one knows him, huh? Who was the first one, stay back here, would you mind? Yo, stay back here. - [Officer] Go ahead. - Get back here, buddy. Over here. Take care of this. Keep these people back here. The ambulance is on the way. - This guy doesn't need an ambulance. He's just taking a quick trip to the morgue. Where are the guys from the lab? - They on the way. - Any witnesses? - No one saw it happen. - Right. Just like my brother's an only child. What did you do, make a public announcement for witnesses? - Well, I asked around in the crowd. - You nitwit. Why didn't you take an ad in the newspaper? - Hey, what's bugging you, lieutenant? - You know people down here clam up when they see a cop. You don't make public announcements for witnesses. They cleaned him out. - Hey, you think robbery what the motive, huh? - No. Write in your book it was a 1040. This character was a bag man for King Lathrop. - Numbers racket. - Brilliant. Another month or two and you might learn what's going on in this precinct. Bust up this crowd. - Say, lieutenant, how did you know that was one of Lathrop's men? - When you've been around as long as I have, you get to know every face. - Really? Okay, bust up this crowd. - Okay. Bye bye. (knocking on door) (door buzzing) Lieutenant Ramos, what are you doing in this neighborhood? Come on in. - As usual, King, this is not a social call. - That's right, Lathrop. - Cool it. - I'm sorry, lieutenant. I haven't been introduced to your new partner. - That's right, King. King, this Sergeant Barnes, the next police commissioner. - What can I do for you, Ramos? - Your boy Rodriguez got it. - Sorry, lieutenant. Familiar name, but I just- - Don't give us that crap, Lathrop. - Don't play games with me, King. I know you've got big trouble down here, lately. - I don't know what you mean, lieutenant. Things are cool in the neighborhood as far as I know. - Who do you think you're kidding, Lathrop? - Kidding? You're the only joke in this room. - Listen, you, I'll bust you- - Easy. You're stepping all over the man's Constitutional right. - You try that again, pig, and I'll chew you up and spit you out. Nobody pulls that shit on me. - Relax, King, or I'll bust both of you up. - All right, lieutenant. Let me lay it out straight. Sure, I know Rodriguez, and I'm sorry he got hit. But I don't know who iced him or why. - The picture of innocence. - That's it for now, King. But hang loose, because I want to see you again. - Drop in any time. Sergeant Barnes, it's been a pleasure. Calvin, come in here. I've got some important business. - If I'd known Rodriguez was on the street, I might have been able to help. - It hurts. He was a decent guy. - There was no way of knowing. He wasn't on Calvin's list. - Maybe that's why his name was missing. - Then you think my feelings were right. - I thought so, right from the go. - No way to get King to see it? - He's convinced that Calvin's completely loyal. - There's a pretty dangerous petition to take. - Hmm. - Let's figure out a way to set Calvin up and prove it, one way or the other. - Yeah, but Calvin's a number two man who will always be a number two man. I don't think he has the balls to cross King alone. - Then who the hell could he be working for? - Find out fast. - Tough enough, getting ripped off. - Right. - But when we lose a key man, I guess that means war. - Right. - What's the next move? - Finding the enemy. You have any ideas, Calvin? - [Calvin] Ah, no. It beats me. I just can't figure it out. - I've got a few ideas. - [Calvin] You mean that bitch, Velvet? - How do you figure she's involved? - Ria saw the new routes. They knew where Rodriguez would be. - Rodriguez's name wasn't on the list you showed Ria. - What're you trying to say? - Let me ask you this, why would Velvet save Martinez's ass, then turn around and ax Rodriguez? - What are you driving at, King? - You're into logic, Calvin. What does it tell you? - It tells me you're talking in circles, King. - Logic tells me the trouble's right here. - You mean, someone on the inside? - Not someone, you, fucker. - What are you talking about, man? - I'm talking about my old friend, my brother, Calvin Christopher. - You're crazy, King. I wouldn't hurt you. - Motherfucker. - No, King, you're wrong. - There's no other answer. It's gotta be you. (grunting) Good man, Calvin. - No. Please, please. Please! Please! - I'm gonna give you a break. I'm gonna let you live. But if I ever see your ass, I'm gonna break your fucking face with my bare hands. You hear me? Now get the fuck out! (phone ringing) - Three to one it's King. Velvet Smooth. - Velvet, I've just cleaned house. - We've been discussing just that. It was Calvin, wasn't it? - [King] Yeah. I almost killed him. - I'm surprised you didn't. - Open up a bottle of champagne, then sign up for unemployment. - Do you really think that's the end of it? - [King] You know it, mama. I just cut out the cancer. - You think Calvin was in this alone? - It figures. - I'm not just looking for work, baby, but my intuition tells me that Calvin was not the main man. - I don't buy that. Let's just call it a day. - [Velvet] You're the boss. - See you later, mama. - Just dumped Calvin, right? - You heard it. As far as King's concerned, we're off the case. - Are we? - No way. - Where do we go from here? - Let's start with the night off. - Good. I have a lot studying to catch up on and a week's worth of laundry to do. - And I have a lot of laundry to undo. - I hear you. I'll see you in the morning? - Say hello to Mat. - Night. - Bye. (gamblers cheering) (light funk music) - Velvet, baby. - Hey. - How are you? - Fine, and you? - Beautiful as always. - Thank you. - Let me get Mat. - Sure. - Hey, baby. You get what you were looking for? - Tonight, I'm here to party. - Ah, you must have wrapped things up pretty quick. - They don't call me Smooth for nothing. - Hey, lady, you keep talking to the help, and I'm gonna be out of business. - Is that any way to greet your best customer? - How about if I buy my best customer a drink? - You're on, papa.

(gun firing) (suspenseful orchestral music) What the hell did you do? - [Barnes] I warned him, but he refused to stop. - He refused to stop so you shot him? - I fired a warning shot but he kept going. - Warning? He didn't have a chance, pig. - Listen, Lathrop. If you're looking for trouble, I'll give it to you. - Put that gun away, you dumb son of a bitch. You've caused enough damage for today. - Damage? I was carrying out my duty as a police officer. - Huh. You better watch your ass on the streets, baby. Everybody hates a trigger-happy cop. - He wasn't even armed. - He should have stopped when I warned him. - That's funny. I didn't hear any warning. - Listen, you. I don't have to explain to anyone. - Except to me, right? Call the wagon. Clean up those people in the back room. Don't forget to read them their rights. - What about these four? - These four concerned citizens who were trying to help the department? I'll take care of them. This was really stupid. I should lock you all up in the slammer to cool down. - I guess my problem's over. Permanently. - Let's hope so, but I really doubt it. - All right. Beat it out of here. I've got a big mess to clean up. - Next time. (light funk music) (groaning) (knocking on door) - Every time. If it isn't the phone, it's the doorbell. I wonder who the fuck it is now? Oh. (eerie ambient music) (screaming) (phone ringing) Hello. - [Man] King? - Who is this? - [Man] This is your new partner. I take it my calling card has arrived. - You son of a bitch. - [Man] Cool it, bro. I mean business. I've been picking apart your operation for a reason. That reason is simple. I'm taking over your numbers game. I'm taking over your whole territory and everything in it. - Listen, you- - [Man] I'm gonna give you a break. You're a bright boy, King. So I'm going to give you a chance to keep a nice piece of the action. - What'd you have in mind? - [Man] It's about time we meet face to face. I want to make a deal. - Okay, brother. You name the time and place. - [Man] No time like the present. Meet me on the roof of the MPA building, alone. - I wouldn't have it any other way. Huh.

Law and order, you know? My laws, and my order. - Double-crossing pig. - Listen good, Lathrop. I let you live because I could use you. - Nobody uses me. - You're not as smart as I thought you were, Lathrop. Shut up and listen. I've got you by the balls, and you know it. I'm willing to let you keep a percentage of the operation. And all you gotta do is meet my price. - You gonna take care of me like you took care of Calvin? - Calvin? Calvin was a fool. He panicked. - I deal dirty, but I don't deal with scum like you. - Deal with me or die. (light funk music) (grunting) (shouting) (grunting) - Fuck you. (grunting) (grunting) (grunting) (grunting) (screaming) (laughing) (grunting) (grunting) (groaning) Barnes! (phone ringing) - Lieutenant Ramos. - [Velvet] Ramos, it's Velvet. - Trouble? - I don't know. I've been trying to reach King all morning, and there's no answer. He's always been home at this hour. - [Ramos] Relax, beautiful, he's a big boy. - I don't know. I've got a gut feeling. There's been too much happening. - If you're that uptight about it, I'll get ahold of Barnes, and we'll check out the neighborhood. - No. I'd like to talk to you. - [Ramos] Start talking. - Not on the phone. I'll be down in a few minutes. - Anything you say, beautiful. (police radio chattering) - Sir, I'm walking down the street. This guy bumps into me. And all of a sudden, my wallet is gone. - What'd he look like? - I, he's, I don't know, he's about your height. But you know, close to that. - Color of his hair? - Uh, dark. Dark. I filled that all out on the- - You don't know what he looked like? - I put that on the form. The guy- - I don't like what's been happening, Ramos. - No sweat. It'll cool off. - I'm getting pressure from both sides. The heat's on from downtown, and the activity in the street looks like an all-out war. - They've got no beef downtown. We collared half a dozen yesterday. - Yeah, but they're all small potatoes except for one guy, and he's on the slab. - That couldn't be helped. - Don't hand me that shit. Every man in the precinct's a little uptight. When an unarmed man gets shot in the back, it makes the whole department look bad. - You worry about public relations, and I'll worry about the streets. - Ramos, we've been knocking around together for a long time, so I'll play it your way. But don't fuck up. - I haven't blown it yet. - [Velvet] Howdy, captain. - You don't waste any time, do you? - Hey. - What's on your mind, Velvet? - I've been feeling I'm being left out of something. - I'll leave you two alone. I've got some, uh, public relations to worry about. - Dammit, you're breaking my arm. - Hey, punk quiet down. - Fucking pig. - Did you read him his rights, yet? - Yeah. - You have the right to remain silent. (grunting) You have a right to an attorney. Take him out of here, will you? - How much do you know about your new partner? - Well, he's hot-headed, he makes mistakes, but I think he's going to be all right. - But he's trigger-happy. - The first time since he's been on the job that he's used his gun. - You remember the first time you shot someone? - Yeah, it shook the hell out of me. I dropped to my knees, held the guy in my arms, and then I put him down. - That's what bothers me. Barnes didn't blink an eye. - [Ramos] What are you driving at, Velvet? - I'm not sure, but I think Barnes got rid of Calvin. I think Barnes is working for somebody else besides the department. - That's pretty heavy, Velvet. - I don't make those kind of statements lightly. - I don't buy it. - Where's the bright boy now? - I don't know. I haven't seen him all morning. - That's strange. I haven't been able to reach King all morning, either. - Bullshit. One thing has nothing to do with the other. - I think it does. That's why I'm here. - I just don't buy it, Velvet. You're drawing at straws. - At least trust me enough to check it out. - I'll check it out, but don't expect anything. - I never expect anything. I'll see you later. - Hey. What's your rush? I'll buy you a cup of coffee. - Thanks for the offer, but I'm going back to look for King. Oh, excuse me. - By no means, baby. Excuse me. - Hey, Barnes, come on in here. Where have you been all morning? Jesus Christ. What the hell happened to you? - I'm all right, lieutenant. It was just a little smash up. - What did the other car do, hit you in the face? - The dumb son of a bitch hit me from behind. I went, bam, through the windshield. I'm okay. I was nothing but an accident. - Did you see the doctor? - Yeah. Good old Snyder patched me up. Hey, lieutenant, if you don't need me right now, I am a little shaken up. - All right. Take it easy for the rest of the day. Catch up on some of your paperwork. Then go home. - Thanks, lieutenant. (phone ringing) - [King] Barnes, don't interrupt. Just listen. I want to settle our business. Meet me right away at the old warehouse. Come alone. - King. Hold it, King. Round up everyone. Meet me at the old warehouse. (suspenseful orchestral music) King! Where are you, King? Lathrop? Is that you, Lathrop? I thought you wanted to finish our business. - Put that gun away, Barnes. - I can't do that, Ramos. You shouldn't have followed me here. Now you're a dead man. - You're not gonna be that stupid, are you Barnes? - You give me no choice. (grunting) Where the hell is Lathrop? What're you doing here? - You tell us. - Shit. I knew it couldn't have been him on the phone. - Why not? - You figure it out, bitch. - I'm gonna come down on you so hard and mess you up so bad that you're gonna beg me to stop. So you're gonna tell me everything I wanna know. - Fuck you. - Easy. Let me take care of this, Velvet. - Get out of my way, he's mine! - Get these son of a bitches! (all shouting) (intense orchestral music) (grunting) (grunting) (grunting) (grunting) (shouting) (grunting) (shouting) (grunting) (grunting) (screaming) (screaming) (grunting) (screaming) - What did you do with King? - He won't cause any more trouble. King is dead. - He's what? - Dead, lady, and I did him in myself. (grunting) - Ramos, King is dead. - Yeah, I heard the whole thing. You knew it was Barnes all along, didn't you? - I had a gut feeling it was him, so I figured I would set him up and let him do the rest. - It puts me in a tough spot. Everything was going so smooth, so slick. Now that King's dead, I'll have to have to get another front for my numbers operation. (light funk music)
