[theme music] [piano music] [indistinct chattering] Mm, mm, hold it, Al. - Are they still out there? - Um-hmm. Funny what some people will do for an autograph. - Bless them all. - And how? Like I was saying, Al.. Hmm? I'm sorry we can't make it. The minute the concert's over we're grabbing a plane for San Francisco. [piano music] [orchestral music] [music continues] [audience applauding] Thank you for that wonderful reception, ladies and gentlemen. It certainly has been a thrill to play for all of you here in Chicago. And as you've probably noticed, most of my musical numbers have been directed at the grown-ups in the audience. And I'm very pleased to see that we have some of the younger generation here as well. And I'd like my young friends to feel that they could make a request, too. What would you like to hear? 'Moonlight Sonata.' [indistinct shouting] - Chopsticks! - Rhapsody in blue. There's a little girl trying to get through to me. What's that, honey? Would you please play "Chopsticks?" Would I please play "Chopsticks?" For you, "Chopsticks." Thank you. [audience applauding] ["Chopsticks" playing] I can do better than that. [music continues] - What did you say? - Uh.. [music continues] [audience applauding] [whistling] [instrumental music] Tony, how would you like to ride an elephant today? - An elephant? - Hmm. It's for the opening of the circus, publicity stuff. No, thanks. I'll take a taxi. - Any other calls? - Two. Would you like to king of the Avocado Festival? Uh-uh, it's fattening. Or open a new aquarium? And get seasick? It's not for me. So I've told them. Would you like some more coffee? Please. - How are all your pen pals? - Fine. - What's this? - Hmm? Oh, the tickets to the big fight tonight. Don't you remember you asked me to write for reservations? - You promised to take me. - Oh, of course. - It should be a good fight. - Yeah, you bet. - How are you betting? - I don't know yet. - Was there anything else? - Um, that's all. Oh, except a wire from New York. Sam has it. It's a Mr. Aldrich. - Aldrich? - Uh-huh. I'm glad you told me. - Sam, where is it? - Where is what? You know, the wire from Aldrich? Well, can't a man even take his bubble bath in private? - Where is the wire? - It's in the pocket of my robe. Thanks. I didn't wanna take your mind off the show. Oh, never mind. - This is it. - Yeah. - This is it. - Yeah. Marion, listen to this. "Flying to San Francisco for your Saturday performance. "Make reservation for me. "An open date for Carnegie Hall appearance being held for you. "Hope you are prepared to discuss terms. J.R. Aldrich." - That's wonderful, Tony. - Yeah, I've waited a long time. Waited a long time for what? Carnegie Hall? What's it got? 2,700 seats. Tomorrow, you're playing the 12,000. Look, Sam, I'm happy to play for the 12,000. But the 2,700 in Carnegie Hall are a challenge. They've judged the finest. Tchaikovsky, Paderewski, Caruso, Rachmaninoff.. And Benny Goodman. Can't you get it in your head? This is the chance I've been waiting for. A chance to give an all classical concert. But you play classics now. You also play pop tunes and folk music. You give everybody something. You give pleasure and comfort to the millions. Why should they lose you to the thousands? I've told you a dozen times before. A pianist hasn't arrived until he's played in Carnegie Hall. Once I play there, I'll have a new career. - We'll all have. - Then you've made up your mind? Yeah. Don't forget to wash behind your ears, Sam. Have you got Zwolinski's address? - Your old music teacher? - Yeah. He's still up on Telegraph Hill. He's been up there roasting people since The Great Fire. - I'm going up to see him. - 'Why?' He can help me with some of my numbers. After all, I wanna be at my best here and in Carnegie Hall. Fine, how long are you gonna be? I'm not sure. Don't forget the fight's tonight. Get Sam to take you. I'll try to make it next time. Next time! Well, that's something to look forward to. He's been saying next time since John El took on the Corvette. - Room service, please. - What did you expect? I expected to to go over tonight, that's what. Room service, it's Mr. Warrin's suite. Would you send a waiter up for the tray, please? Thank you. How long have you been working for Tony? You know very well. Four years. Hmm, and how many of those years have, uh.. ...have you been in love with him? - In love with.. - Yeah. Three, three and a half, or four? T-there's no crime in, in liking someone. No, but there's a crime in not doing something about it. I can't just throw myself at him. He'll only step over me on his way to the piano. [bell ringing] - Hello. - Yeah? Is the maestro in? He's taking his constitutional. He'll be back. I wonder if I could wait for him. You don't look like the criminal type. Ha! Sure, come in, come in, and make yourself at home. And you'll excuse me for keeping on with me work. I've got to take care of me other tenants. Oh, this house is too much for the likes of me. 'People coming and going..' [piano music] [doorbell ringing] Come in. Perhaps I should have telephoned first. Perhaps you should have. I'll come some other time, Mr. Zwolinski. Zwolinski? What makes you think that I... That you'd bother with a beginner? - Well, no, I... - I'd never impose, believe me. It's my family and friends. I'll be frank with you, Mr. Zwolinski. When your family has money, you.. You're supposed to be accomplished. So I became accomplished. I learnt to paint, to ride, to dance. Even tried to play the piano. All my relatives tell me I'm very good. Confidentially, I'm not. Some people are just born listeners and I'm one of them. My family won't be convinced until I get a letter from you saying that I should stick to Mediterranean cruises and canasta. I feel silly bothering you. I think I'll leave. Wait. Sit down. Sit down. Zwolinski is interested. Sometimes even a pretty face can have talent. We shall see. Play something. I don't know. What should I play? - Anything. - Alright. [piano music] No, no, no. You're tense. Relax. Let yourself go. I'm sorry, I've told you I'm not... Play. Zwolinski is listening. [piano music] Please, please, my dear, young lady. What are you doing to my piano? Teasing it? Flirting with it? This is not a scrabble board. Where did you practice your scales? Reaching for martinis? - I've had enough. - You've had enough? If I can take it, you can take it. Get up, get up. You're just playing notes. There's no feeling. You gotta put your heart into your hands. - And practice. - Practice. Always practice. I'll show you. [piano music] [Anthony] 'Yes, practice and listen to the masters.' 'Who've you heard?' Everybody I can. I'm going to Anthony Warrin's performance tomorrow night. - Have you seen him? - No. Only his records. The man is a genius. An authentic genius. - Zwolinski speaks. - I agree with you. He must be a wonderful person. Yes, he is. You are a woman of good taste and rare judgment. I think that's lovely. Lovely? Ha! 'That's a matter of opinion.' Professor Zwolinski, am I glad to see you! - How are you, my boy? - Fine, and you, maestro? - Never better. - Good. I see you still remember a few tricks I taught you when your name was still Waridovski. Yeah, since I changed my name, I've added a few of my own. Yes. You look wonderful, Tony. - Thank you. - Wonderful. Happier, richer. - Fatter. - Yes. And such beautiful clothes. You still have imp-imp-imp... - Impeccable? - Yes, uh, impeccable taste. Who is the young lady? Oh, uh, a-an old friend, maestro. - Miss, uh, Miss, uh.. - Linda Curtis. Miss Linda Curtis, Professor Zwolinski. - How do you do? - How do you do? You're very fortunate, young lady to have the great Anthony Warrin give a concert, just for you. - Anthony Warrin? - Yeah, l-look. I'm sorry, I.. Let me explain over lunch, huh? - Oh, I'm sorry but... - Good. - You will excuse us, professor. - Certainly. [Linda] 'Glad to have met you, professor.' I'm glad, too. But I don't understand you, Tony. 'You come, you go.' 'Why did you come?' To improve my technique, maestro. But perhaps, it's good enough. - Did you enjoy your dinner? - Delicious. - How did you like the lasagna? - It was excellent. Good, and now the bill. So, 2.25.. - 8.75. - That's funny. What's funny? I seem to have left my money in my other suit. The other suit, huh? - Do you have a pen? - What for? - I'll write a check. - No check. - Why not? - 'Cause I no take no check. I only take cash. COD. You don't seem to understand. I play the piano and I'm... Oh, you play the piano, huh? - Yeah. - Good. So my little bambino. Come on, pay the check. Wait a minute, I'm Anthony Warrin. And I'm Mario Lanza. Cash. - Here. - Oh, thank you, lady. Ah, thank you very much. Ah, come back again, lady. Hey, buster, if you come back with her please, wear the other suit, huh? [muttering in Italian] [audience applauding] Ladies and gentlemen, we're pleased to have with us tonight the great pianist, Anthony Warrin. [audience applauding] I think if we gave Mr. Warrin a great big welcome maybe he'd honor us with a number. [audience applauding] Well, this is a surprise. I'm very, very happy you called on me because I enjoy your company and the wonderful music. - Hello. - Hello. Where are you girls from? San Francisco? - We're just tourists. - Oh, I see. You know, I love a room like this. It's so friendly and intimate. I almost feel I can reach out and touch you. Do you mind if I touch you? [audience laughing] Do you wanna touch me? Go ahead, come on. A little higher, honey. Up out here is where I get the message. [laughter] Ah! [laughter] You don't mind if I don't play right away. I'd rather enjoy this. [laughter] What's the matter? You feel alright? Oh, I feel fine. But I think I'm going to faint. [laughter] Before you do, is there something special I could play for you? Just play. Anything. Okay, well, how would you like to hear my favorite kind of American rhythm? [audience applauding] [swing music] Now, that's the way Boogie-woogie started out. With the left hand playing down there all by itself. And someone came along and thought it would be a good idea if the right hand could do something. And then it began to sound like this. [music continues] [piano music] And along came a variation. They call this one the walking base boogie woogie. It walked back and forth like this. [upbeat music] [music continues] Now, this next part is what they call a boogie woogie break and you'll notice right in the middle I stop playing for a moment. And that's because...there isn't any music for that part. [all laughing] [upbeat music] [male #1] 'Hey!' [music continues] You know every time I play that little break it seems to bring out something out of certain people in the audience. And this time if you feel the urge to shout "Hey" just let it out. [music continues] [in unison] Hey! You wanna do it again, don't you? [music continues] [in unison] Hey! I got an idea lets have the ladies do it all by themselves this time. Okay? [upbeat music] [in unison] Hey! [music continues] Okay fellas, now it's your turn. [music continues] [in unison] Hey! [music continues] You know its always fun to do boogie woogie with only eight beats in the bar. I'd like you to hear a little invention of my own it has 16 beats in the bar. [upbeat music] [music continues] [all cheering] Wonderful. [whistling] Encore. Encore. It'll take you up to the second floor the art museum. Where my assistant upstairs will tell you all about the Dutch art exhibit. Step right into the back of the elevator it's a nice friendly group.. Not you, bud. Alright. Rev her up. Look, pal. I know who you are. If I'd have tipped off those women you'd been signing autographs all afternoon, right? Right. You're here to have a good time, right? - We certainly are. - It's very kind of you. Oh, that's alright, lady. But I think you owe me something. - I do? - Yeah. Now, look. - I like good music. - Oh, that's fine. You can use a couple tickets to the concert tonight. Oh, I sure could.. Oh! No, not tonight. - Tonight's my bowling night. - Oh! But I'm not against a little day time music. - Day time music? - Yeah. Come on. Follow me. Well, come on, lets go. - Say listen... - No, not now, bud. Step right in here. Go ahead. Go ahead. Some layout we got. Just look at 'em. - 'Aren't they beautiful?' - 'They really are.' 'Yeah. Well, lets go.' Play. You don't expect me to play these pianos, do you? Well, why not? Go on get in the ring go ahead. Atta boy! You too, lady. [pleasant music] But isn't it against regulations? - Who's gonna know? - Oh, go ahead, Tony. Besides it'll be fun and remember you owe him something. - Yeah the lady's right. - What happens if we get caught? I get fired. Ha ha ha. Go on help yourself. [music continues] "Frederic Chopin, played this spinet in Paris during 1841." "Ignacio Jan Paderewski, on this piano he made "his spectacular American debut in 1891 "at Carnegie Hall." [piano music] [music continues] Gee, that's pretty. Very pretty. Yes, it is. I wasn't speaking about the music. Linda...how long have we know each other? Only about 26 hours. Twenty-six hours. That's not a very long time, is it? No. But under certain conditions...you might say it was almost like.. Like knowing a person a lifetime? Exactly. [Melvyn] 'Okay. The intermission's over.' Lets go. Where to now, buddy boy? Right this way. He's beginning to sound like my manager. Here you are. You can take you pick. Liszt or Mozart. I'll take Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Oops! Well, sure he's all yours. [piano music] Linda, did you know that Mozart was a musical genius at the age of six? No. He became a great composer. He was decorated by the pope. It's a very unusual sounding piano. Yeah, it's got a nice tinkle to it. Well, it's not really a piano, it's what you call a harpsichord. [music continues] Linda, did you ever wonder what it would be like spending a lifetime married to a musician? No. Why? It wouldn't be easy. Why not? Got a union haven't you? Sure we have a union. Say do you mind if I talk to the young lady? No, not at all. What were you about to say, Tony? Well, it's a rough life for the woman. Travelling, recitals. It's not easy competing with a concerto. I would say that depends. On the woman. - It could work. - Sure it could. - Linda, I... - How about a little Liszt? Say, buddy boy, what's your name? Uh, Melvyn. Figures. You think that's bad you ought to hear my middle name it's even worse. Uh, how about playing a little "Liebestraum?" [playing "Liebestraum"] [music continues] [music continues] "Liebestraum. Dream of love." You're right, Linda. It could work. Are you proposing to me, Tony? What do you think he's doing? Lets get married right away. Oh, I want to. - But.. - But you need time to think? Of course not but.. I have old fashioned parents, they're waiting for me in Banff. They're expecting me this weekend. I really should let them know. - Why don't you call them. - Oh, no, I couldn't. Why not? It wouldn't be right. I'll see them. I'll go tomorrow, tell them and.. ...I'll marry you whenever you say. I say the sooner the better. Well, that's settled. My 'ol lady was right. I should've taken them piano lessons after all. [instrumental music] Ah, some house. Quite a batch of telegrams. You're very popular in San Francisco. What time is it? Eight forty. I'm not going to keep those people waiting any longer. - Mr. Aldrich said he'd be here. - Well, he isn't. So, we'll just forget about him. Will you let the manager know we're ready to go on? Sure. - Is he out there? - Not yet. - You're all set? - Yeah. Hit it, Charlie. Go out there and rock 'em. Okay. - Good luck. - Thanks. [piano music] [music continues] [orchestral music] [piano music] [orchestral music] [piano music] Oops! Oh, I'm sorry. Do you mind? Oh! [piano music] [music continues] [crowd cheering] [piano music] [crowd applause] - Oh, I'm sorry. - It's a pleasure. Fate. We were meant for each other. [all laughing] [indistinct chatter] Here we are. I'm not sure I should accept gifts from a stranger. When you've sat in a mans lap, you're hardly a stranger. My name's Howard Ferguson. Sergeant and unheroic. US occupation, force is Japan. I'm Linda Curtis unaffiliated. Japan you said? You're going or coming? Coming. I'm heading East for discharge. - You must be very happy? - Oh, I am. Cherry blossoms and geishas are fine. But after a while you get to miss the Giants the automat. I also miss writing. Writing? Are you doing a book? I haven't got the rank. You've got to a general to write books. No, I meant music. Am a composer. A sort of composer. - Popular song? - Oh, strictly heavy weight. I'm working on an American opera. That's why I came here tonight to get back into music again. I'm a great fan of Anthony Warrin's. We have that in common. He respects the classics. But from a sitting position, not from his knees. What's your opera about? It's about a Evangeline. I'd like to play it for you, if I ever finish it. I'd love to hear it. We better get back. I don't wanna miss a second of it. [instrumental music] [music continues] [crowd cheering] - Great mob. Drink some water. - Thanks. And you want to give this up for Carnegie Hall. - Take a bow. - 'Mr. Warrin.' Mr. Aldrich, how are you? I'm fine, but I wanna apologize. We were grounded by fog for several hours. I thought we'd make it, but otherwise I'd have phoned you. Well, that's alright. You know my secretary, Miss Moore. - How do you do? - My manager, Mr. Dunne. Hello, Dunne. I'd have given anything to hear you. You don't have to. I'll play for you. How about a little Chopin? You've been out there for three hours. - Aren't you tired? - I'm not. They don't sound like they are either. I'll see you. [crowd cheering] [piano music] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [crowd cheering] Bravo! [cheering continues] [cheering continues] Mr. Warrin, you still haven't given me your decision? Decision? Mr. Aldrich has an open date four weeks from tonight. The stage is yours for a concert. And I hope you'll say yes. I've waited a long time to say yes to Carnegie Hall, Mr. Aldrich. - Then it's date. - It's a date. - You better change now. - Okay, Sam. - Excuse me. - Pardon me. - Tony. - Hmm. The way you cut that number short out there.. ...was anything wrong? No. Nothing. Are you sure? Sure. Nothing at all. [knock on the door] Come in. - Oh, Tony, you were wonderful. - Linda. - Oh, I'm so proud of you. - I'm glad, honey. I saw you sitting out there. Couldn't miss that red coat. Sweetheart, I want you to meet my secretary Marion Moore. - This is Linda Curtis. - How'd you do? Here comes the other half of my family. This is my manager Sam Dunne. Linda Curtis, Sam. - Hello, Sam. - How'd you do? - How did you like the concert. - I loved it. - How much? - This much. Enter one blonde. [car horn blaring] Now, Tony, another 30 seconds and you'll have a new public. I hope you're right. You got nothing to worry. Go out there and put 'em in the isles. See you downstairs. Lets go, folks. - Good luck. - Thanks. By the way, I meant to tell you. We just learnt all the music critics accepted. All of them. That's great. I got 'em seated in the third and fourth rows. - Now, give it to 'em good.. - What did you say? [voice fading] I said I got them all in the third an forth rows.. Sam. Sam, tell Aldrich to hold the curtain. [no audio] [no audio] It's no use. 'Tell 'em to go home.' I'm deaf. Stone deaf. [dramatic music] It's almost an hour, isn't the doc through yet? Just about. What does he say? Nothing yet. Well, doctor? It's just as I thought. Thank you. Otosclerosis. Hearing will return ...temporarily. But deafness...will continue. Unless...we are able.. ...to successfully...operate. What's the risk? "Fenestration." Is that the name of the operation? "Fenestration is a very delicate operation "and in special cases highly dangerous." 'Am I one of the special cases?' "If surgery is successful hearing is completely restored "If surgery fails.. I'll be totally deaf for life. 'It's quite a gamble, doc.' What of I took a rain check on the operation? You said my hearing would come back, for how long? "Hearing will return briefly for indefinite periods until one day disappears completely." [melancholy music] With the operation, it's all or nothing, is that right? Well, doc. What do you recommend? [music continues] I don't like long shots. I'll think it over and...when I make up my mind I'll let you know. [music continues] There's a window inside the inner ear leading to the auditory nerves. In Mr. Warrin's case, his window is blocked by a boney growth. Sound has trouble getting through. In the operation we cut a new window, next to the closed one. The nerves are found intact this restores hearing. And...an operation is his only hope? Positively his only hope. If you need me for anything call me. - I'll see you to the door. - I'll find my way out. Oh, one more thing. He's apt to become depressed and irritable If he decides against the operation, he ought to learn lip reading. 'It'll divert him, take his mind off himself.' If he learns to read lips, he'll get along much better. If you can talk him in to it, I'll send a good teacher. Well, fine. - 'Goodbye.' - Goodbye. And thank you, doctor. What're you doing? I'm gonna tell Tony what's good for him. - Is he still writing to Banff? - Every day. - Good. - Why? I'm going to phone her. She ought to know what's going on, she should be here. Yeah. I guess you're right. [tires screeching] [Howard] 'Hello.' Hello. Well, I'm sure glad I waited for you. You don't seem to happy to see me. I didn't recognize you. You look so different. I wanted to wear the stripes but the colors didn't blend. Move over. Unless you want me on your lap again? You look wonderful. I phoned you several times but you were still in Banff. - You phoned? - They said you'd be back today. And on your way to this address, so I thought, I'd surprise you. Well, I am surprised. Who told you I'd be here? Didn't you know, I've got Mata Haris all over the place. Oh, I'll have to improve my security. How's the opera? Oh, it's stuck on a high note. But you're in luck, I've got time to spare. Are you very busy right now? I've an appointment. I'm already ten minutes late. Can't you be an hour late? It's with Anthony Warrin. Oh! Anthony Warrin. Let's not keep him waiting. He's doing alright. Yes, he has a lovely place. I didn't mean his place, I meant you. So far I'm just a friend. Who better get upstairs. Linda. According to my book a friend is a companion, comrade chum, confidant or mate. What kind are you? Well, according to my book, a friend is a person for whom one has great attachment. I'm that kind. So long, friend. So long. - Hello. - Hello. - I'm glad you could come. - Is Tony in? Yes, before you see him, I wanna talk to you. You told him I was coming, didn't you? Yes, I did. He didn't wanna see you. He didn't wanna see me? That's right. I don't understand. - Sit down and I'll tell you. - I wish you would. I thought something was wrong, when he wouldn't talk to me. He couldn't. You see he can't speak on the phone because he can't hear what's being said to him He's deaf, Linda. He's deaf? Had some trouble before but no one thought it would reoccur but it did. Is it permanent? Unless he has an operation. Yes. Why didn't somebody tell me about it? He didn't want to, so I couldn't. But you did. Yes. Because I was thinking of him. Why don't you go in, the door is open. [pleasant music] I love you too. But that's not the point now. That's the only point that interests me. I can't hear you, Linda. Oh, I'm sorry. Maybe it doesn't matter to you, but it does to me. [music continues] You're wrong. I haven't given up, it's just that I don't see the sense in playing the piano anymore if I can't hear. It's impossible. Nothing's impossible. We can do it together. We'll get married and I'll help. Oh, I'm sorry. It won't work. Let's be sensible. When I asked you to marry me in San Francisco it was different then. I had my music, my career. I had something to offer you. [pleasant music] It was you.. The person not a pianist. If you decide against the operation.. At least try.. ...lip reading. That's just it. I need time to think. Time to make a decision. Give me that time. Go back to Banff to your family and let me work it out. Let me work it out alone. Relax. Now. As I wrote for you here.. "There are four groups of consonants. "There are those formed by the lips and shown by the lips. "Such as P, B, M. Pha. Bha. Mmm. "Then there are those formed and shown by the tongue only. "Such as TH, T, L. Tha. Ta. La.. Now. May, pay. Mark, park. You said, May, pay. Then you said, Mark, park. "It is a far, far better thing that I do. "Than I have ever done It is a far.." "Far better rest that I go to than I have ever known." Sydney carton. "A tale of two cities." How am I doing teacher? Young man, you just skipped a grade. Make it two grades. It's been exactly 12 weeks. In all my experience I've never known anyone to progress so rapidly. Not rapidly enough, Mr. Rojeck. I'm still shut out. Shut out? I don't understand. Well, Mr. Rojeck...I spent a lot of time looking down into the park. All those people. 'I can't read their lips.' [Mr. Rojeck] 'The people in the park?' Well, of course you can't read their lips they're too far away. No, they're not. - Not with binoculars. - Binoculars? You see, I don't go out. So I bring the people up here with these. 'But I can't understand 'em.' I guess I'm not good enough yet. Well, even if you were good I'm not sure it's possible. Oh, it's possible. I got these in Europe. And the man who sold them to me said that the Germans used these in Turkey during the last war. Oh. The hired deaf-mutes to sit opposite open restaurants and lip read the private conversations of our diplomats. I believe you're right. I did read something about that. Try it. You'll see what I mean. It's amazing. These are powerful lenses. What do you see? I see some boys playing football. Can you tell what they are saying? - 'Well, yes.' - Signal 7, 15. 'The quarterback's calling signals.' 7, 15, 32. Hike. 8, 6.. Hut 'There's a forward pass.' 'Oh, it missed.' Little boy watching tried to get it. 'Uh, the other kids are laughing at him.' [Doc] 'Why?' [Tony] 'He's crippled.' Children can't be cruel, but they don't mean it. Well, it's uncanny. These glasses bring them right up as big as we are. So it is possible. Yes. But I spent years at lip reading. For you to do it, it would take a lot of time. I've got nothing but time. [instrumental music] - Oh, good morning. - Good morning. - How are you doing today? - Fine. Our little friend has a seed on a 50 yard line. - Oh. How is the game going? - Not so good. They've been arguing for the last 15 minutes. - About what? - The usual thing. Naturally the kid who owns the football wants to be the captain and the other kids won't let him. [chuckles] Oh, he's tellin' him again. "If I can't be the captain you can't use my football." 'Well, there he goes with his football.' 'The games finished.' And you finished the course. You've overcome a great handicap, Mr. Warrin. From this day on, you can live a normal existence carry on conversation, be with friends, have a family. Yes, you're to be congratulated because with lip reading you can hear again. Yeah. Yeah. I can hear people. But I still can't hear that. [instrumental music] You didn't eat breakfast. I wasn't hungry. Anything from Linda? Oh. I'll give her a break. Six letters in seven days. On the seventh day you shall rest remember? Tony, look, I'm gonna take a walk. Why don't you come out with me? - No. Thanks. - Why not? I have company. Ludwig van Beethoven, his life and deafness. Well, I'm sure he didn't sit and brood over his deafness. You don't think so, huh? Listen to Beethoven "Recreation in human society. "Conversation. Confidential outpouring-ness. "None of these are for me. "I must live like an exile." He wanted to kill himself only his art held him back. I don't even have my art. And you ask why I brood. Well, I still ask it. Because you're quitting and Beethoven didn't. He wrote some of his best after his deafness. The Kreutzer Sonata. Eroica, The Ninth. And some of his greatest quartets. It's not the same. He wasn't a pianist he was a composer. He was more. He wasn't only a composer he was a courageous man. And you can be too. Tony, you can do anything you wanna do. Why must it be the piano? You can compose. Remember that melody you were working on? The one you came up with in Miami three years ago. Well, I'm gonna tell you a secret. Come I'll show you. What is it? I've written some lyrics to it. Me a song writer. Don't laugh. Now, you sit right there and I'll find the lyrics. Look, can I just read the words? Now don't be difficult. No music, no lyrics. Play.

The words are fine but there's no music. - Playing what I can... - You've got to play, Tony. Your deafness is just another test. You got to face it. - A test? - Exactly that. You faced a test once before and you overcame it. I know because Sam told me. You were down and out starving remember? Didn't fold up then you fought back. You played music everywhere for anyone who listened. You got where you are because where you refused to quit. And I won't let you quit now. End of sermon. And I guess end of my chances of getting a raise. [melancholic music] [music continues] [piano music] [audience applauding] [audience applauding] [music continues] [instrumental music] [music continues] Tony! What are you trying to do? I look at you and I don't understand how much of a coward can one man be? Alright, maybe I am a coward. Maybe I don't have the phony heroics you like to see in people. But I know how I feel inside. And I know how the people down there feel. And it makes me wonder. Wonder about God. A God who hasn't time. Hasn't time to help anyone who needs him. [dramatic music] [music continues] [music continues] [instrumental music] And, dear God one more thing. I know you got lots on your mind and.. And maybe I shouldn't be reminding you but.. You know, I missed the football season last year and-and I kinda thought you'd help me this year. But, so far.. Well, I've missed the first two games. I guess, you've just been too busy. [instrumental music] [music continues] Hi. - Good morning. - Bird watching? I've just keeping eye on your friend. Is he looking at the football game again? That's right. Poor kid. Maybe. At least he has faith. Faith? Praying everyday just because he wants to be a quarterback. Just a quarterback. I guess it's that time. We better be getting to church. Well, I'm not going, grandpa. Why not? 'Cause I don't believe it anymore. You don't believe what, Alvie? That-that praying can help. Of course it can. It can get miracles. I don't believe that praying can get anything. [dramatic music] Alvie needs lot of money to become a quarterback. Talk to his grandfather and get their address. Tell him that I'll have the money for operation by tomorrow morning. They're most likely wanna know who's paying for it. Just say a friend. Now get down there before they leave. - Or you won't get that raise. - Right, boss. - Morning, Sam. - Yeah. How is our human radar this morning? You see Lady Godiva yet? Whatever he's been seeing sure works up an appetite. Had grapefruit, four eggs, six pieces of bacon and three cups of coffee. - Some breakfast. - Hmm. Oh, and-and a stack of cinnamon toast with jelly. - Good morning. - Good morning. Here's a letter from Banff. Good. It's a letter from Linda. Oh, I'll read it later. I've got a date with Mrs. McGinley. Now who is Mrs. McGinley? An ingenue or a character bit. Mother type with a problem. She come here every week to meet her daughter. Her daughter struck it rich married a wealthy broker named Cosgrove. Lives with his family in West Chester. You say the daughter lives in West Chester? Mm-hmm. Then why doesn't she meet her mother there? Instead of in the park? That's the problem. Ah! There's Mrs. McGinley. And here comes the daughter. - Hi, mom. - Hi. My you look pretty. You say they meet down there every week? Every week. I still don't get it. Oh, no, Sarah. I don't want it this week. I appreciate it of course but it's-it's not what I want from you. Oh, mother, you're not going to start that all over again. I just don't understand it. Seven months since you ran off and married him and I haven't met him and I haven't met his family. But I've told you it takes time. What time? Why? I'm your mother. I'm in New York. Won't they ever ask you about your mother? Of course they do. I've told them all about you. All about me? Well, not exactly. Mother, how can I explain it to you? I wanted so much to marry him and I wanted his family to approve. So, when it started I-I made up things. All kinds of things about our background. And I told them you lived in the West. Mother, I'm sorry. I told all those lies. But it's done. And soon when I feel a little more secure I'll bring you to West Chester and you can meet them. What's going on? Plenty. Do you want to tell us? Later. Don't misunderstand, mother. Dick likes me for myself. The Cosgrove's do too. Sure they do. You're a McGinley. Now-now no more fretting. I'm sorry if I upset you. I, uh.. I guess I just get lonely sometimes. I'll be alright. You better run along now. You'll be later for your lunch. Will you take the money, mother? Please. I better. I'll see you here next week and we'll have a wonderful time. We'll go to Movie City and.. Well, we'll have lunch first. You are a darling. I love you. Bye, Sarah. Oh, and, Sarah. Uh, you're getting too thin. Don't try to look like those society girls you eat three square meals a day. Okay, ma. Next week? A small American tragedy. Mrs. McGinley gets everything from her daughter except recognition, respect and love.

Hiya. You alright? I'm fine. - You sure? - Sure. I'm just through with lip reading for a while. - Through at lip reading? - Uh-huh. For how long I don't know. But if it's alright with you I'm gonna spend the rest of the night playing the piano. And if it's alright with you I'm gonna spend the rest of the night listening to you. [music continues] I'm sorry, mom, but we'll have lunch and the show next time. - I promise you. - Mm-hmm. I just forgot all about the charity carnival when we made out date. Cosgrove's are coming in at 6:00 and the Mrs. Poindexter is expecting us early. I have a 100 things to do before then. I would have invited you but.. Well, it's an invitational affair. Hmm. You know, Mrs. Poindexter's friends? Don't be silly, what would I be doing there? You run along, baby. [chuckles] Look, you go home and call one of your neighbors and invite her to Movie City. I read the reviews take three handkerchiefs. - Bye, mom. - Bye. [dramatic music] [instrumental music] [music continues] [applause] 'Ladies and gentlemen I'm delighted to announce' a special attraction at booth 9. The world famous Anthony Warrin's here in person to play requests. Uh, booth 9, pardon me please. My dear, how did you ever manage to arrange it? Oh, I just arranged it. Oh, how clever of you. Well, let's go. Mom, pop. Oh, sure. [applauding] This young lady will accept your request and your money. The line forms on the right. One at a time, please. [indistinct chattering] Alright. Waltz and A flat. Uh, who? - Chopin. - C-H-O-P-I-N. C-H-O-P-I.. - Here it is. - Well. Chopin's revolutionary etude. Another Chopin? I never heard him on television he must be on at the same time as Ed Sullivan. - Next please. - Here you are. - Oh, there. - Thank you. Oh, what can I do for you? I should like Mr. Warrin to play the Scherzo Movement from the B flat minor concerto of Brahms. Oh.. How can he play it if I can't spell it? Come again. The Scherzo Movement. Now which one do you want the Scherzo or the movement? Why, I.. Let's give her both. Fine. Thank you. Come again. Next. I would like for Mr. Warrin.. Mother. Sarah, my child. What a surprise. Is this your little girl? Yes. Sarah, this is Mr. Warrin. - How do you do? - How do you do? Um, mother, Mr. Warrin this is, my husband. - I'm happy to meet you, mother. - Me too. - Mr. Warrin. - Hello. And, um...my mother-in-law and father-in-law Mr. and Mrs. Cosgrove. [in unison] How do you do? - And Mrs. Poindexter. - We've met. Why, Sarah, why didn't you tell us your mother was in town? - Well, I didn't... - I hate to break this up. But, uh, business before pleasure. - Now who made the last request? - Uh, Mrs. Poindexter. You remember she wants the, uh.. Movement with the skirts.. Wouldn't you rather hear the Beer Barrel Polka? - Beer Barrel Polka? - Yeah. A wonderful idea, Mrs. Poindexter. Good ol' American folk music. Oh! Oh, indeed yes. [laughing] Hey, you boys, in the band if you're not busy jump in. [piano music] [music continues] Do you dance? Oh, yes. But I haven't for a long time. - Shall we? - Why not? - Do you mind? - Oh, no. - She's great. - She certainly is. Where you been hidin' her? Sarah, make her stay with us don't let her go back West. Well, it's very kind of you. I'll see what I can do. [music continues] [applauding] Sarah, do you have a request? Well, I was going to ask for Rhapsody and Blue. Rhapsody and Blue it is. In honor of your mother's arrival. [applauding] [Warrin playing "Rhapsody and Blue"] [piano music] [music continues] [music continues] [instrumental music] [music continues] [piano music] [music continues] [instrumental music] [music continues] [applause] [applause fading] Well, you certainly straighten things out for Mrs. McGinley. Hey, what's the matter? I'm back to lip reading again. Lip.. I'll tell Marion to get the doctor. No, don't tell her. Don't tell anybody. Let's not spoil Christmas. Well, how does it look? Oh, beautiful. I think it's even prettier than last year's. Yeah, I do too. But it needs just a few more ornaments. Oh, maybe so. Well, I think this is the last package. Mm-hmm. Look, do you think she'll like it? It's lovely. Any woman will be proud of it. I hope you're right. Say, you sure you can't stay? - Linda'll be here in a minute. - No, honestly I.. As I told you I have to have dinner with my relatives. I don't just mean dinner. I meant the job. Oh, it's been wonderful working for you. But after tonight you'll have Linda. She'll manage for you very well. Hmm. Linda's one thing and your another. Three is a crowd. Besides I'm not getting any younger. And I can't afford to work for a boss who isn't eligible. - Well, I better be going. - Wait a minute. Merry Christmas. - I hope you'll like this. - Thanks. Make belief you won the Irish sweepstakes. Get yourself something practical like, uh swimming pool with six diving boards or an oil well. Maybe a long trip. Long trip? Sounds good. Oh, I almost forgot something. Merry Christmas. Thanks. It's uh.. ...tough to say goodbye. Yes, it is. - 'Bye, Tony.' - Bye. [dramatic music] She wouldn't have gone if she'd realized you couldn't hear. That's why I didn't tell her. It's better this way. Yeah. Maybe. [dramatic music] [music continues] Can't you understand. The way woman feels and the way she acts are sometimes two different things. It doesn't makes sense. Everything doesn't have to make sense. Didn't make sense when I let myself see you in Banff. Didn't make sense when I finally admitted I loved you. Then tell him the truth. No, Howard. I just can't. Why not? He's terribly ill. [scoffs] So he's ill. I read about in paper. He injured his hand it'll heal. Before he knows it he'll be back with his music and his public. It's not his hand. It's his hearing. He's deaf. [dramatic music] [instrumental music] There you are. - Cheers. - Cheers. [clears throat] And also.. This doesn't make it any warmer out here. - Let's go inside. - We will in a minute. I wanna talk to you. If it's about us fine. But we've already talked about the weather and the view... - It's about us. - Good. Maybe. Linda, when I sent you away it was because I wanted time to think about myself, but mainly about us. You sound like a man who's going to be difficult. I'm afraid I am. What do you mean? Well, after I learned to lip read. I used these to look in to the park. I became involved with total strangers. I learned a good deal about people. For instance. There's a man dressed as Santa Claus. A little boy is asking him "Why there are so many Santa Claus tonight? He's having a tough time trying to explain. [dramatic music] And there's a young man seated on a park bench. He's smoking and thinking. He seems awfully lonely for Christmas eve. Perhaps you'd like to look at him. He's right there under the light. [music continues] You saw us down there. Yeah. I didn't mean to. But I did. And I'm glad I did. For your sake and for mine. Oh, Tony, when I met him I never dreamed... You met him and you fell in love with him. Things like that happen. Happened to you. But you and I agreed... We agree, we made a promise. But a person can't marry a promise. You belong with him. You know it is cold up here. It is even colder down there in the park. Why don't you go to him? Tony.. Merry Christmas, Linda. Merry Christmas, Tony. [instrumental music] Tony, come on in. I want you to meet a couple of nice people. Make yourselves comfortable. This is Mr. Hunt and Little Alvie. - Hello, Alvie. - How do you do, sir? How do you do? Pleasure to meet you. Thank you. I want you to know how much I appreciate everything you've done. And how are you feeling, Alvie? Fine, sir. I've been practicing how to kick and I'm gettin' pretty good too. Lou Groza just better watch out. Yeah. Sam, didn't we have something for Alvie we were gonna deliver tomorrow? Yeah. The red one. Come here, Alvie. Gee, thanks! Gosh, it's big. I know it's not right to open it before Christmas but.. ...but do you think it'll be alright if I took a little peek? - Well.. - What do you think, grandpa? Maybe you better wait till tomorrow, Alvie. Oh, let him open it now. Might be something that melts or spoils. - Alright, go ahead. - Good. - Wow! - Try that. - How does it fit? - Perfect. There's something else. Wowie! How do I look, granddad? Oh, you look fine. Mr. Warrin, I think Alvin's too excited to tell you but he's forgotten something. Oh, no, I haven't. - It's for you. - Thank you, Alvie. Should I wait until Christmas to open it? - No. Go ahead. - Okay. Oh, it's beautiful. Yeah. Lift the lid. [playing "silent night"] It's playing "Silent Night". - What did you say? - It's playing "Silent Night". That's one of my favorite songs. Mine too. Unwrap that. [Silent night music playing] I wore it in the hospital. So I wouldn't be scared. And I wasn't either. [music continues] [instrumental music] Well.. ...we should get the big news any minute now. I got a wire from Marion. It's in the drawer. She must have read about it in the papers. I'm glad she sent it. It's almost like having her here. I wish she were here. [door opens] Good morning, Mr. Dunne. - Good morning, doc. - Tony. [Doc] 'Now we're going to see what the score is.' Scissors, please. [intense music] [music continues] Now, Tony, can you hear me? Can you hear me now, Tony? [intense music] Hand me the flash light, please. [scissors clanging] - What was that? - I'm sorry, I dropped.. She dropped the scissors. I heard it. I heard it. Thank God! I can hear. [applause] [orchestral music] [music continues] [music continues] [piano music] [music continues] [music continues] [piano music] [orchestral music] [music continues] [piano music] [orchestral music] [music continues] [music continues] [applause] Magnificent, Mr. Warrin! Absolutely magnificent! - Thank you. - You have a new career ahead. Many years of classical concerts you can forget all about that other audience. I don't think I have to. I think I can have them both. - What do you mean? - Go and show him, Tony. Yeah. Don't go away. [applause] I'll never forget this wonderful reception you've given me this evening. I'll never forget this evening. But it would not be complete unless I can play some of my old favorites for some of my old friends who are in the audience tonight.
