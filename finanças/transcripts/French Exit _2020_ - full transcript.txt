[PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] [DOOR OPENS, CLOSES] [FOOTSTEPS] [DOOR OPENS, CLOSES] [DOOR OPENS, CLOSES] HEADMASTER: Mrs. Price, you can't just show up unannounced in the middle of a semester and remove your son from the school. FRANCES: Well, I don't want to fill these out, and I'm not going to, and I'm afraid that concludes the tune. Good morning. What do you wanna do? I don't know. You wanna come away with me? These rules are put in place for a reason, Mrs. Price. - What about my clothes? - I'll buy you new clothes. [♪♪♪] [CLEARS THROAT] Did you drink to the brink of sound reasoning? [DOOR OPENS, CLOSES] Were you driven to insomnia by the violence of your muse? No. Menstruating? [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] How are things with Susan? We're in our holding pattern, as if you didn't know. Mm. Oh, to be youngish and in loveish. Will you see her today? [INHALES SHARPLY] I can't join you anyway. Mr. Baker insists on a meeting. Another plea for thrift? Wait and see. It's all gone. What's all gone? Not the money in my account. It's... not your account for long. - It's in my name. - The name, you get to keep, but every penny in that account, in addition to the investments and properties, are going back to the bank. The properties? You'll be locked out on the 1st of January at the latest. Certainly I'll be able to keep the money - I brought to the marriage. - [SIGHS] That was shuffled into the estate a long time ago. And it wasn't... excuse me, a very large sum. And Malcolm's legacy? No. I spoke to you about this as a possibility for seven years. And then an eventuality for three. What did you think was going to happen? Frances, what...? What was your plan? My plan was to die before the money ran out, but I kept and keep not dying and... here I am. All right. [INHALES SHARPLY] It's all been settled, then. [SUCKS TEETH] So... now I want you to tell me what to do. - Do? - Yes. Tell me, please. Um, what can I say? T-take a loan from a friend. Mm, impossible. Name something else. There's only one thing you can do, Frances. Sell it all. Sell the jewelry, the art, the books. Sell them privately, quietly, cheaply. Bring me the checks, and I'll have it all transferred to cash for you. And then what? And then... whatever you wish. - [CAR HORN HONKS] - Hey, watch it. [♪♪♪] - Susan... - What if we went to Frances, and we told her about our engagement? You know? Together. What, you and me? Together. Yes. - When? - Now. Talk to my mother together now? No. - Why? - It's a bad idea. The only way it will work is if I tell her myself. What exactly are you afraid of? The same thing you're afraid of. I'm... I'm gonna tell her now. [KNIFE BLADE SCRAPING] [DOOR OPENS, CLOSES] [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] Listen, there's something I need to talk to you about. Are you cooking? No. I just like the sound it makes. What is it? What's that, Mr. Mumbles? Well, my news trumps yours. Are you ready for this? We're insolvent. We've nothing left. Nothing... left. [GASPS] [LAUGHING] [SNIFFLES, CRYING] [♪♪♪] [MEOWS] ANALYST [ON TV]: ...precious metals because they're long-term assets. I mean, gold is money. So if you wanna hold gold, you hold gold as a reserve asset. You don't buy it today and sell tomorrow. About my fee. A straight 30 percent. And that is non-negotiable. Oh, isn't it? Nope. Mightn't it be? Well, it's going to have to be if you wanna work with me. Twenty-seven percent. I'll give you 15 percent or I'll thank you for your time. - Twenty-five. - Oh, Mr. Rudy. If you name another figure that isn't 15 percent, I'll go to 14. Name another, I'll go to 13 and on down the line until your payment and your sole function in regard to my life disappears altogether. Well, that's no way to negotiate. This is a tricky job. It could, uh, be detrimental to my reputation. Your reputation? - That's humorous. - Is that right? Have you heard any rumors regarding my mental health? No. Well, I heard that you were odd. - Odd. - Odd, yes. Difficult. - Difficult. - And, um... then there's the story about your husband. Oh. Which story is that? You... finding him. Yes? - You know. - Oh. I found him, but then I... I left the body for a while, didn't I? - [CHUCKLES] - People still talk about that? - Sure, they do. Of course! Heh. - Well... Well, I'm going to tell you a private truth now. I'm more than odd. There's a goodly part of me that wants to set this building on fire with myself and my son locked in. What do you think of that? Um... [CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY] That's, uh, none of my business. Mm, I say it is. Because if I don't get my price, this goodly part of me will become ever more goodly. [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] JOAN: The hens are clucking, Frances. FRANCES: Are they saying I'm broke? JOAN: They are. Are you? [SIGHS] - [CRUNCHES] - [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] - A plan is coming to me. - Mm. Possibly idiotic. I don't know. But the more options the better, right? Mm-hmm. What about my apartment in Paris? I haven't been there in a year. It's just sitting empty. Mm. To get out of New York is the thing, honey. It's sensible. Sensible. - Sensible. - Sensible. Ow! [CHUCKLES] - I'll get this. - No. Frances. Thank you. [♪♪♪] SYLVIA: The check bounced again, Mrs. Price. Mrs. Price? [DOOR OPENS, CLOSES] C-could I have cash? [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] Do you have any cash for Sylvia? - How much? - Six hundred. Thanks, Malcolm. There's been a change in plans, pal. Oh? I didn't know there was a plan to begin with. Yes, well. It's been decided that we're going to go to Paris. - We are? - Mm-hmm. For how long? Mm, difficult to say. Perhaps for the rest of our lives. [♪♪♪] - [DOOR OPENS] - [RAIN FALLING] [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] [DOOR CLOSES] [MALCOLM CLEARS THROAT] So, what do you have to report, Malcolm? Have you told your mother about our engagement? I want to. The thing that I can't figure out is whether or not you expect me to wait for you. Of course I do. But that wouldn't be very chivalrous of me to ask, would it? Is chivalry an interest of yours? [SIGHS] I have many interests. Would you describe yourself as a coward? No. How would you describe yourself? I don't know that I'd bother to in the first place. I want you to know that I am trying to fall out of love with you. - Susan. - What? I'm going to Paris. Paris. When are you going to Paris? Soon. - How soon? - I think tomorrow. You think tomorrow?! When are you coming back? That's the thing. I don't really know. [SIGHS] Well... It's all very moving, I'm sure. - What? - Your devotion to a woman who didn't hardly introduce herself to you until you were 12 years old. Your refusal to live beyond the rules that she's written for her own benefit. You don't bring flowers to someone you're saying goodbye to, Malcolm. Please leave. [DOOR OPENS, SHUTS] ♪ And I'm starting To feel the pain ♪ ♪ So I'm getting ready For the heartbreak... ♪ All good things must end. HOST: But are you certain you have to go? Yes, and we're very sorry about it. What a shame. We were having such a lovely evening. Were you really? Oh, such a lovely evening! And I do hate to go, but it sounds like we've got a proper emergency at home. And what can be done in the face of that? Nothing. [CLEARS THROAT] [♪♪♪] FRANCES: I'll miss this. What? This. MAN: Got anything to spare tonight, folks? Possibly, we do. But may we ask what you need the money for? I guess I'd like a little wine if you wanna know. Mm. What's your name? - Dan. - Daniel. What would you do if we gave you $20? [WHISTLES, CHUCKLES] I could get a gallon of Three Roses, a pack of cigarettes and... a weenie. And where would you take it all? - Back to your room? - I'd take it into the park. That's where I sleep most nights, in the park. Mm. So you'd... lie under a bush and smoke your cigarettes and drink your wine. And look up at the stars. Why not? OFFICER: That guy wasn't bothering you two, I hope? Looked like he was putting a bite on you. Who? Daniel? No. Not at all. He's a friend of ours. [CHUCKLES] I thank God for the fact of a man like him. Not that it's any of your business. Let's. [♪♪♪] - Why Euro, Frances? - I'm going to Paris. Oh, that's right. You talk the talk, don't you? Oui, petit cochon. "Little prince." I'm going to miss you, Frances. Won't you all.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I... [SOBBING CONTINUES] MADELEINE: I shouldn't have done it. Ugh. What?! [PEOPLE CHATTERING] [PIANO PLAYING SOFT CLASSICAL MUSIC] WAITER: Excuse me, um... Whose cat is this? [MEOWS] [CLEARS THROAT] I'm Malcolm. Will you tell me your name? - Madeleine. - Madeleine. Will you have a drink with me? No. Who's this person? Madeleine. She tells fortunes on the ship. - What's she doing? - [MEOWS] Oh. I'm sorry. Do you not know? We know. We're going to lie down. Will you come visit us later? What's she paying you? - Paying me? - Aren't you her gigolo? Oh God, no! That's my mother. Oh. Excuse me, but you'd be surprised at how common it is. [WOMAN WHOOPS, LAUGHING] What was that woman so upset about before? A third of the people onboard this ship are in the presence of death. But if I say a single word about it, off I go. You told that woman that she's dying? She'll never see land again. [CLEARS THROAT] Dry gin martini. Two. [GASPS] Okay. [♪♪♪] Okay. [GIGGLES] I won't be needing these. FRANCES: It's like retirement in a way. Though, no, I've never worked a day, so, what mantle is being retired even? [SIGHS] I'm not sure how we're going to get you into France. [MEOWS] All that lovely money. [DOOR CLOSES] [ANNOUNCER SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY OVER PA] I understand you're moving to Paris. FRANCES: Mm-hmm. Are you very excited? Mm, I suppose I should be. I admire you carving out a second act for yourself. - Bravo. - Thank you. But it's the third, if we're to be honest, or the coda, if you'd rather. Is it true that it's five miles to the bottom of the ocean? At its deepest, it's shy of that, but only just. Mm. Five miles is an uncommon depth, however. Where we are now, it's more along the line of two miles. You can take some solace in that. [FRANCES CHUCKLES] FRANCES: A little bit. Are you all right? - I'm the ship's doctor, right? - Right. Well, yesterday some moron posing as a gypsy told one of the passengers that she was dying. Which is bad enough. But then the woman really did die. Do you mean Madeleine? The gypsy? Yeah, I think that was her name. You know her? [SCOFFS] Well, they just threw her into the jug. The jug? The brig. Can they do that? Goddamn right, they can! A middling lawyer could prove that your buddy murdered that woman. The threat of violence leading to cardiac arrest. [SNAPS FINGERS] These old birds, they spook. Just say boo at them. And with death on deck and in a contained environment, they freak fucking out. I've seen it. It's grim. I could show you something very terrible, if you'd like. [DOOR OPENS] MALCOLM: What happened to them? BORIS: Oh, just that they died. We've been at sea for three days. Two bodies a day. That's the industry standard for an Atlantic crossing. Ahh! I don't want any. - But you have to. - Why? Because it's fun! You and me, drinking drinks. Thank you for showing me all of this. I won't tell anyone about it. Yeah, tell who you want.

[CHUCKLES] FRANCES: Your father and I stayed around here in a hotel for our honeymoon. MALCOLM: I can't imagine you two on a honeymoon. FRANCES: Yeah. It was all the normal things. Hotels and the flowers and the champagne. It's strange to think he was actually fun. But in the beginning, he... He really was. [DOORBELL BUZZES] [GASPS] Hey! You made it. Come in. Let me take your coats. Oh. Thank you. We're not early? No! You're right on time. But where are the others? It's just us. Would either of you like a martini? I've been waiting all day for mine. - I would like a martini. - All right. Frances? [FOOTSTEPS RETREATING] What the fuck is going on here? REYNARD: My husband died this summer. After, I realized that our friends were actually his. And not only that I didn't like them, but they didn't like me, either. I don't miss them particularly, but I miss the noise they made. That's why I invited you over. Ah, you want us to make noise. [CHUCKLES] No, um... I'm... lonely. How'd he die? - He choked to death. - [CHUCKLES] That's a new one. Please don't be cruel to me. It was difficult to get up the nerve to ask you over. I suppose I... I don't see why we're here, is all. Just, I was curious to meet you. Of course, I know who you are. I grew up in New York City, and... You know, we're the same age, about. We just thought you were so wonderful, my friends and I. So wonderful. And when I heard you'd come to Paris, I thought we might become friends. I appreciate that. But the fact is, I've no need of friends in my life at the moment. [CLEARS THROAT QUIETLY] Well, that's... I'm sorry to hear that's the way you feel. But... you're here now. And I've made a cassoulet. And I vote we make the best of it. What do you think? Malcolm, shall we make the best of it? Of course. Would you like another martini before the wine? - Yes, please. - Okay. All right. You're being a dick. Isn't it awful? All right, I'll stop. I'm sorry. Ugh. [SIGHS] You know, he died in that very chair. Here. Uh, what, may I ask, did he choke on? Ah, lamb. Ah. And have you eaten lamb since? No, but you know, I never liked lamb much in the first place. FRANCES: Yeah, no. I don't, either. The gamy meats somehow summon the fact of the animal's existence, which puts me in mind of its death. REYNARD: I've never thought of it before. Whereas a steak is simply a steak. Yes! That's right. I was just going to use the powder room myself. I won't be a moment. - [SNIFFS] - [FOOTSTEPS RETREATING] [DOOR CLOSES] Go look in the freezer. What? - Go look. - Why? Go look. [FREEZER DOOR OPENS, CLOSES] I've never understood them. What's to understand? Is it something one uses alone or with someone there to... help? Either or. Hmm. But why would you want it cold? That's the mystery. - [DOOR OPENS] - [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] [CHUCKLES] I'm a little crocked, I think. Malcolm, would you mind serving the cassoulet? Thank you. I'll scald myself if I try. Everything's ready for you in the kitchen. It, uh... Becomes like water, doesn't it? Heh. Mm, it's better than water. [LAUGHS] Can I share a recollection I have of you? - All right. - Uh, it was about... a dozen years ago, in the months after your husband's death. I was eating with a group at Le Circe. And a man at my table was speaking poorly of your husband when you came in. Oh, you looked so smart. We couldn't help but stare. Then, you passed by the table. The man stopped you and said: "Mrs. Price, I knew your husband well. And it's all I can do not to dance on his grave." Do you remember it? No. I don't. Oh, really? And what did I say to him? That's the thing. You didn't say a word. You drank his drink. Straight Scotch. And you stared at him with a look of... absolute indifference. The poor man... didn't know what to do. He was so ashamed. I'm sorry I was rude to you. [WHISPERS] Oh... My life has... fallen completely to pieces. And I'm up... set about it. I... I... know just what you mean. I'm sure you do. - [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] - Oh. Here comes Malcolm. Sustenance! [♪♪♪] [CAR HORNS HONKING] - SUSAN [ON PHONE]: Hello? - MALCOLM: Hi, Sudsy. What are you doing? It's 6:30 in the morning. MALCOLM: Right. Shit, I'm sorry. SUSAN: Where are you? MALCOLM: I'm by the canal. I'm calling because I wanted to hear your voice. Here it is. Here is my voice. TOM [ON PHONE]: I'm out. Who's that? SUSAN: Tom, wait. - Good luck today. - [DOOR CLOSES] Good going, Malcolm. Were you expecting me to mourn my loss in perpetuity? - Yes, I was. - Well, it's beyond all reason for you to try and make me feel bad about this, - so don't you dare. - Fine, but... [SNIFFLES] Who is this person? Tom? I've told you about Tom before. He was my fiancé in college. What were you wishing him luck for? He has an important meeting today. Oh, an important meeting? - That sounds important. - Enough, Malcolm. Listen, he says he wants to marry me. Hello? Uh... Do you wanna come visit me in Paris? - Did you hear what I said? - Yeah, I heard you. But you're already engaged to me. That's polygamy. It's illegal. - Malcolm. - It's a felony. - Malcolm. - What? Will you... Can you please not call here? At least not for a while. I've been feeling better in the last couple of weeks, and I'd appreciate you keeping some distance. Hello? [LINE CLICKS, DISCONNECT TONE BEEPING] [♪♪♪] - [HISSES, SNARLS] - Ouch! [BREATHING HEAVILY] Is he back yet? No. Does that hurt? No. Thank you. What are you thanking me for? [♪♪♪] REYNARD: Perhaps you could take Small Frank's departure as a signal to welcome another animal into your lives. A kitten is an agent of great good. I didn't want a cat in the first place. I don't like cats. It was only that Small Frank impressed himself upon us. And there was nothing to do but endure him. All right, but if you feel that way and now that he's run off, can't you simply let him go? No! REYNARD: Oh. [WHISPERS] I've upset your mother. - [DOOR CLOSES] - Well, she's upset in the general sense. We're out of champagne. Do you ever feel that you've had adulthood thrust upon you at too young an age? And that... you're still essentially a child... mimicking the behaviors of the grown-ups all around you so they won't uncover the meager contents of your heart? The witch you fucked on the boat. Malcolm fucked a witch on the boat over. - [POPS] - She understood him, didn't she? - I think she did. - Well? Why can't we ask her where he is? I don't know that she'd know, and I don't know how we'd find her, either. I would like for one of you to please explain - what you're talking about. - Well, the fucked witch and Small Frank were connected. Let's not call her that. She understood about him. What is there to understand about Small Frank exactly? I'm puzzled, and this is what's puzzling me. [SIGHS] It's not something we... typically discuss. But the long and short of it is... that my dead husband lives inside of that cat. [LIGHTER CLICKS, LIGHTS] Is that a fact? An unfortunate fact. How do you know this? It's an understood thing. Can you make it understood to me? I don't know. I wish you'd be good and take my word for it. I'll try. Frank ran away because I told him something he didn't like. REYNARD: And what was that? I'm sorry, but I choose not to say. Anyway... I believe she might be able to help and that we should seek her out. - Seek out the fucked witch? - That's right. Let's find something besides that to call her. How do we find her is the question. - I got it! - [CLANGS] Ooh, ow! [EXHALES SHARPLY] Private investigator. Who may I do what for? I and my son need to find a girl. A young woman. She's a clairvoyant from the United States living in Paris. Or is she not living here, but visiting, Malcolm? - I don't know. - Anyway, she's around. What is your relationship to this woman, madame? Uh, none whatsoever. My son knows her, though. Carnally. [CHOKING GURGLE] [COUGHING] It can be helpful for me to understand the nature of your desire to find this person. Well... we've lost our cat. Yes? And this woman, we believe, might be of some assistance in locating him. She knows the cat's whereabouts? Not at the moment, but, uh, it's come to our attention that this woman can speak to the cat in her mind, you see. What is the name of this woman? Madeleine. We don't know her surname. This is far too much, madame. Keep it. It's like a tip. Just you find our little witch for us, all right? All right. [♪♪♪] [INDISTINCT CONVERSATION] FRANCES: I saw a man's penis yesterday. He was pissing in the park opposite the apartment. Have you noticed men simply take them out and use them here? There's no harm in it, I suppose, but it... Well, it does take some getting used to. Yesterday's was memorably large. What a gift that must be for a man. What a lottery life is. Well, it was nice to see it, I'll admit. Oh, Joan. When the money runs out, I'm going to kill myself. But I want you to know that you were the only one, other than Frank, when he was himself, and Malcolm. Please, will you take care of him, if you can somehow? I've always admired your heart. Your heart is the rightest of all. [GIRLS SPEAKING IN FRENCH] [LAUGHING, CHATTERING] [IN FRENCH] Madame, this is too much. [♪♪♪] REYNARD: I don't know who's famous anymore. These people are all strangers to me. - [CHILDREN CHATTERING] - [MEN SPEAKING IN FRENCH] [SPEAKING IN FRENCH] [MEN ARGUING IN FRENCH] [ALL EXCLAIMING] - [KNOCKS ON DOOR] - REYNARD: Entrée. Would you mind telling me the story? FRANCES: Oh. All right. Well, uh... Well, I was... I was leaving for Vail that weekend. And the car was idling in the street. And the driver was loading up my luggage. And I remember thinking, heh, it was silly to explain to Frank that I was going, because he wouldn't care, and what was the point? But I decided I would tell him. And... up the stairs I went, and he was dead. In our bed. There was a cat... sitting on his chest. Uh... licking his face. Making the most awful noise. But I couldn't seem to feel anything but a sense of hopelessness and... I mean, that there was nothing to be done. And then came the feeling of just wishing to go. And then needing to. When I returned Monday evening, he was exactly where I left him. Only he was blown up like a balloon, heh. And the color of one too. Well, I called the paramedics, who called the police. When I returned home from the precinct... paparazzi were on the stoop. And so was the cat. He followed me inside as though it was a natural thing. I knew just to look at him. [THUNDER RUMBLING] [♪♪♪] [THUNDER CRASHING] [MEOWS] MADELEINE: Franklin? Franklin? Are you there? We're here with you, Franklin. Won't you please speak with us? - FRANK: Who are you? - [GASPS] Madeleine. We met on the boat on the way to France. Do you remember? - What do you want? - Just to speak with you. I'm here with Frances and Malcolm. Hello, Frank. - Hello. - How are you? Well, you know. Malcolm? - Yeah, Dad? - What's this all about? - All what about? - The hocus-pocus. Just that you ran off, you know? We were curious where you'd gone off to. No one place. I'm behaving nomadically. REYNARD: You're living by your wits. I admire that. Who said that? Madame Reynard is my name. I'm so very happy to meet you. I'm a great friend of your wife and son. Honestly, they've had a remarkable influence on me. I believe that friendship is a greater force for good than any religion ever was. Don't you agree? Frances, please! Why'd you run away, Dad? Good question. Great question. Why don't you ask your mother? Why did Dad run away? It's pretty complicated. - It's not that complicated. - Where are you, Frank? - [THUNDER RUMBLES] - I choose not to answer that. - Does anyone wanna know why? - JULIUS & REYNARD: I do. - I do too. - I do and I don't. It's just a small matter of Frances' intention to kill me with her bare hands. [SCOFFS, LAUGHING] - Hey, Malcolm? - Yes, Dad. What do you think of all this? Your mother wants to kill your father. Yeah. Any thoughts on it? To be honest, Dad... I'd just as soon not get involved. Nice. That's nice. That's family for you. I guess what I mean to say, Dad, is I don't think it's really fair for you to ask me to weigh in on this. Considering the fact that I don't know who you are. Have never known who you are. And not because I didn't want to. But because you never so much as parted the curtain for me. Never showed me the slightest preference or kindness. Even as a child, when I worshiped you. And all I ever wished for was for you to take me by the hand and walk me through any motherfucking park, pat me on the fucking head. For chrissakes, was I that repellent a creature to you? [GLASS SHATTERS] What's eating him?! He just told you what's eating him, Frank. He hates you. Fuck you.

[IN ENGLISH] Yeah, forgive me for my state. I am normally quite handsome. Not just my friends would say it. Mm. Do you know, I... I saw what happened yesterday. - Is that right? - Mm. What did you make of it? Just that I thought you behaved very bravely. How is it that you're not in jail? Thick wrists, madame. I just slip out of my handcuffs like Billy the Kid. I've changed my mind... about the orange. Only the finest orange for you, madame. The finest, most delectable orange in this sack. For you, my guest. The mysterious, beautiful woman in the window. Hold your hand. May I have some of your orange, madame? [CHUCKLES] I'm very ill. I haven't got much longer to live, actually. You'd be doing me a great favor if you would accept this. - Why? - It would make me happy. Won't you take it all? No. See that man over there? He'll take your money.

I can't say. - May I ask who you are? - Madame Reynard is my name. - How do you do? - I do well. In fact, I do very well. Where will you be staying? It can be difficult finding a hotel at the last minute. This is my apartment. Who is this horrible woman in my home? [FRANCES CHUCKLES] FRANCES: Give her a chance. She isn't so bad. Since when do you humor your admirers? Strange, isn't it? Perhaps I'm... simply tired. Yes, I think that's what it is. And this? Well, I have no idea how that was sent. Its delivery doesn't concern me so much as its contents. A low day and the mood has passed. Has it? Yes, dear. [♪♪♪] It's very nice to meet you. Likewise, it's a pleasure meeting you. I slept in. Who are you? Ballpark figure. How many people are staying here? - This is it. - [KNOCKS ON DOOR] - Entrée! - [DOOR OPENS] Well! But this is everyone. I promise. Oh, before I met Susan, I thought I knew what it was to be in love. Said it and meant it. Heard it said to me and so glad to know. But... what are those feelings compared to this? This... This is something else. This is... a love poets aspire to. - Are you a poet? - I work in finance. There is, I feel, a certain, uh, poetry in numbers. - Gross. - What did you say? I said, gross. I asked Susan to marry me, and it was looking good. Then she gets this early-morning telephone call. Since she hung up the phone, I've been playing catch up, trying to figure out what she wants. And if I'm not mistaken, she wants him. - REYNARD: Well? - SUSAN: I thought I was happy. I... I was happy. But then Malcolm called... and now, I... I don't know what I'm doing. What am I doing, Malcolm? I wonder if you could take your head out of your ass - for just the briefest moment. - Wait. It's a complicated situation, but I believe we can express our respective points of view - while maintaining our dignity. - Bravo. Which isn't to say we should hide our emotions. - REYNARD: Oh, never. - For example, uh, I feel that I could kill Malcolm. Actually murder him. Here and now. But no. I won't do that. You're lucky. I've always been lucky. REYNARD: Have you? I've been neither lucky nor unlucky. I've been luckless. I've been incredibly lucky at times and... well, tragically unlucky at others. I've only been unlucky. But I have a sense that this will change suddenly and permanently. Anyway, that's what I tell myself. I've only been unlucky. And, heh, I believe I will always be. [♪♪♪] It's not big enough for the two of us. No, it's not. I talk in my sleep. That's all right. Also, I gnash my teeth. - All right. - [CLEARS THROAT SOFTLY] And I have sleep apnea, and sometimes I sleepwalk. If you see me set out to wander, - you mustn't wake me. - Okay. Sweet dreams, Madame Reynard. [WHISPERING] We're just... [LAUGHING] ...two little old ladies. [BOTH LAUGHING] [♪♪♪] Saffron is not on the list. It's a needed thing. And three bottles? We'll use it. Later or sooner. [BOTTLES CLATTERING] Darling, would you please grab us a cheese plate? Pardon. [IN FRENCH] Do you have something for... [IN ENGLISH] Five hundred? [IN FRENCH] - Case or bottle? - Bottle. [REGISTER BEEPING] [CASHIER IN FRENCH] €2012.73, please. We'll need these delivered, is that all right? CASHIER: Oui, madame. JOAN: I told Don I had to run to Paris because I thought you might kill yourself. He was fiddling with the remote. He told me: "Tell her hello if you get there in time." - Hmm. - I had a moment earlier this year when I realized, when you get older, you don't even want love. Not the kind we believed in when we were younger. Heh, who has the energy for that? When I think of the way we used to carry on about it. FRANCES: Ugh, I know. JOAN: Men and women throwing themselves out of windows. What you want is to know someone's there. But you also want them to leave you alone. - I have that with Don. - Hmm. We allow ourselves contentment. And a heart brings us ease in its good time. It's a nice thought. You don't agree with me? It hasn't been that way for me. JOAN: I'm sorry I just find the whole thing so contemptuous. The very idea of a suicide note. The idea of suicide coming from you. And it's such a cliché, isn't it? Someone so bright and promising killing themselves after the glamour has passed. [SIGHS] Well... for one... that's an extremely shitty thing to say to me. Two... the glamour passed a long time ago, and you know very well that it did. [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] Third... Three, yes. My life is riddled by clichés. But you know what a cliché is? It's a story so fine and thrilling that it's grown old in its hopeful retelling. People tell it. Not so many live it. JULIUS: Two, three, go! [BOTH GRUNTING] REYNARD: I can't claim to know either of you well, or at all. But I can see you're above such petty jealousies. Ugliness begets ugliness. I volunteer we strive for grace. Neither of us is bothered, Madame Reynard. You say that. But obviously, you don't mean it. But I'm not in love with Malcolm. To be honest, I don't even like him very much. [ARM CRASHES ON TABLE] TOM: Malcolm. Ready? Go. - You win. - Come on! Do it right. Two, three... go! - He's not even trying. - You're the big winner. It's not winning if I win like that. If I win... you take your bags, and you leave. Alone. [CHUCKLES] - [HANDS CLAP] - JULIUS: Okay. JULIUS: Ready? Two, three, go! Wait a minute. What did I win? Nothing. Everything is exactly the same as it was before. [REYNARD SNICKERS] REYNARD: This... This reminds me of the performance artist I saw on the television. She walked the length of the Great Wall of China. Then, she broke up with her boyfriend, and then... people paid good money to see her go to the bathroom in a bucket. [SNORTING CHUCKLE] In a museum. I used to worry about my not understanding modern art. Huh. TOM: I don't like you people. I don't like these people. They're not normal people. Ooh, couldn't you please find it in your heart to like us just a little bit? No. TOM: Where's your bag? - Time to say goodbye, Susan. - [LUGGAGE ROLLING ACROSS FLOOR] - Susan. - Tom... [ALL GASP] [SIGHS] [ALL GASP] We're leaving, Susan. SUSAN: You go ahead. No, I'm really gonna go. This is your last chance. It's now or never. Never, please. Thank you. [DOOR OPENS] Um... I sing to use the waiting My bonnet but to tie And shut the door Unto my house No more to do have I Till his best step approaching We journey to the day And tell each other how we sang To keep the dark away [REYNARD CHUCKLES] [♪♪♪] I'm bothered by the thought of you hating your father. I don't like you carrying that around with you. Also, I don't quite feel your father warrants it. This coming from the person who wants to strangle him? [CHUCKLES] Can I ask you a very dramatic question? Yes. Why did you have me in the first place? [INHALES DEEPLY] Well, that is... dramatic. Well... it wasn't planned, of course. I thought I couldn't have children. Had never wanted one. Then, when it happened, we thought... your presence could help us come together. And, well, you were a last-ditch effort, in effect. But then, when he saw you, it... I don't know, clarified something for him. And he turned away forever from you and me. Both. But I shouldn't hate him? [SUCKS TEETH, SIGHS] Your father is an emotional moron. But he isn't evil. What happened when you saw me? Oh. I've never been so hurt... by something in my life as when I saw your face for the first time. Why? Because you were your father. Because you were me. Because you were all three of us. So ruinous. And why did you come to me when you did? That was strange, wasn't it? Heh. It was unexpected. I wanted you to come, you know. But I wanted you to come for so long that when you finally did, I was confused. I'm sorry. I know. But don't be. I was happy. Really. - Were you? - Yes. I didn't know you were you. I'd have come right away if I had. I'd never have let you go in the first place. You understand what it did for me. Yes. - I hope you do. - I do. [♪♪♪] I love you, pal. I love you too. Good night. ALL: Good night. [DOOR SHUTS] [DOG BARKING IN DISTANCE] - FRANCES [WHISPERING]: Madeleine. - Mm. - Madeleine. - Mm. [REGULAR VOICE] Were you sleeping? - FRANK: No. - What are you doing? Just sitting here under this bench. Well, I was just thinking about you. I thought I'd give you a ring. [CHUCKLES] Don't you wanna know what I was thinking about? - All right. - Three things, actually. Do you remember our first date? I don't. No. Yes, you do! You took me to Tavern on the Green. You ate your cupcake with a fork and knife. No? - No. - Why did you do that? The fork and knife, I mean. [SIGHS] I don't know, Frances. - Who knows? - [SUCKS TEETH] [SIGHS] The second thing is I'm feeling badly about our last conversation. And I want you to know I don't hate you anymore. It's late to be telling me this. Late at night, or late in life? Both, but mainly late in life. I can't understand that as an attitude. Your wife of long years, who only days earlier wanted to murder you, has had a sudden shift in feeling for the good. Is that not noteworthy? - I guess so. But, Frances... - What? - I'm a cat. - I know that. I'm a cat. And I've got worms and fleas. And, you know, I'm not much concerned about anything besides the unhappy fact of my horrible, my truly horrible, miserable fucking existence. I see. Well... are you ready for the third thing? Heh, sure. When I came to Paris the first time, do you remember what I told you about it? About how I felt... startled to be here? I remember you telling me. Oh. You remember something. How nice that is for you. And me. Oh, it's nice for the both of us. Hail, hail. Well... I figured out what I was startled by. And what's that? I recognized Paris as the eventual location of my death. What does that mean? Something... in the sight of this city... sent up an alert. It was the presentiment of what was to come. Do you see? - Frances... - [BLOWS] Thank you. That's all. [♪♪♪] [DOOR OPENS] [DOOR CLOSES] [MAN SPEAKING IN FRENCH] Excuse me. [IN ENGLISH] Are you all right, madame? Why wouldn't I be? Just that it's quite late to be out. You are. That's true. I've lost my cat. Yes. You've got the look of someone who has. And that's why you are out so late on your own? You want me to help you look? No. No, thank you. [♪♪♪] Frances? We'll fan out and meet back here in an hour, right? - All right. - Right. REYNARD: Susan, will you stay here in case she comes back? - Madeleine's bag isn't here. - Well, there you go. Frances probably walked her to the train. Malcolm, put your coat on. [♪♪♪] [GATE CREAKS, SLAMS] [RUNNING FOOTSTEPS] So how was it? - How was what? - Your educational experience. - I don't know. - Don't say "I don't know." Of course you know. What was it like? Not really very much fun. Didn't you have any friends? Some. But you found the relationships unfulfilling? I don't... I don't... What was the food like? The food was awful. Your father's dead, pal. I know. How do you know? Kids told me. They showed it to me in the paper. What did the papers say? - That he died a while ago. - About me, I mean. What did it say about me? It's okay. Go ahead. - It said you were arrested. - Mm. Why was I arrested? It said you didn't do what you were supposed to do. Look. What was done and what was not done was done or not done for a very good, very real reason. - All right? - All right. And what you have to understand is that I was not wrong. If this is going to work... you and me, I mean, you're going to have to take my word for that. All right? Okay? Okay. - [ENGINE STARTS] - What was jail like? Not really very much fun. What was the food like? You're getting it. Now, let's have that tie. - Why? - Oh, it's... Ugh. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪]
