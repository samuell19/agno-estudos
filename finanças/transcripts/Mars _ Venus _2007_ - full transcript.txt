- Mommy, I had a nightmare. - No, Emil. - I dreamt about The Big Bang. - It's the middle of the night. - I want to sleep with you. - Is it morning? - Come with me and look at the boat. - Where is the wrapping paper? - Don't be so negative! - I have a presentation in 40 minutes. Oh, my God! There's a field trip today. - Are you wearing that sweater to work? - Yes. What does sensitive mean? - What are you reading? - A book about planets. Aunt Camilla left it here. Remember to pick up the mats from the cellar, "If we aren't aware of our differences,- " - men and women can easily get into conflicts." "We get disappointed time after time." "We do not take time to communicate about the differences between us." - Have a nice day! Bye. - Bye! Have you fallen asleep? I'll just get off here, or I'll be late for my meeting. - Bye. - Bye. - Good morning! - Hi. - Thanks. I made it today, too. - Not bad. - Are they here yet? - Yes. We'll summarize afterwards. - Ida Birkeland. Architect. - Chief town planner, So... This is the new harbour area around Tjuvholmen. - How did it go Friday? - We stayed until three thirty. - Did you have a good time? - Oh yes. Great. You wanted to see me? Three people? You said that no one in our department would have to go. You knew this was going to happen. You will have to start looking into it. It's part of your job. So you want to present it in a more visual manner? Yes, and also visualise how people use the area. Show that it's the people that shape the area. Not the other way around. We have to have the best presentation. It depends on how strong our idea is. Okay. When? The deadline is Midsummer's Eve. I can make it! I'll do it on the weekends. And in my spare time. Look here... Erik, Erik! Hi, fatty. - Coal. - Right? - This is Ada. - Hi. Mathias. - Look at it. - Great shape. - The guys can pitch in a few weekends. - 120.000 is a lot of money, though. And when lately did you use any money on yourself? - Should we buy the boat? - Yes! Of course! - I'll have to talk to Ida about it. - Does she make all the decisions? Did you just wash these? What? - My God, the place is a mess. - Yes, I did wash clothes. Can't you get them off to bed now? - Does she make all the decisions? - No. Mathias. Stop it. I'm trying to work. - Isn't it nice? -1 guess so... Just not right now. Stop it! Stop it... Damn it, Mathias! Don't you understand how important this is to me? You are ruining everything. T've tried to talk to you about the boat. This is important to me. A boat? There are other things we need first. What's with you? Would you be happier if we got a slightly larger apartment? - I don't have time to discuss it now. - This boat is for sale now! - We have to talk about it now. - Aren't there thousands of boats like that? No. There's only one. Ida, we don't do anything together anymore. With a boat we could go away for weekends and during vacation time. And spend all spring getting the boat ready? - It's a great project. - Oh, yeah? Like our bathroom. - Hi there. -1 have glue everywhere... Don't be silly. - Aren't there thousands of women? - No. Just one. We discussed the presentation of Tjuvholmen at the board meeting. You're right. We have to stay one step ahead. - Really? - Remember to make room for the bricks. - Will we give it a go? - Yes. And it will be a separate project. Separate budget, project development and supervisor. We just need the the right person to supervise it. - Maybe we should talk afterwards? - Yes. QOvertime? But, Ida. Last night we agreed to go and look at the boat. What kind of boss let's you know the same day? I'm in the middle of a meeting. Okay, fine. Bye. - Are you sick? - Look what I've found! Barcelona. You and Mathias. I'll take the rugrats. - Not today. He's pissed off. - This is a two- for one offer. Two tickets for the price of one. - Not today. - It's an offer you can't refuse. Put on your shoes. - Hi. - Hi. You deliver and pick up? You're like the perfect father. Well, Ida has a lot of work these days, so. Hope she realizes how lucky she is. Well, I'll tell her she has the perfect guy. I said, perfect father, Oh? Well... Bye. You have all the qualifications to supervise the project. You have to trust what you know. - Administration is not my strongest side. - But you have the know- how. It is all in the presentation. You can't talk down the price on this one. You've got your GPS and map machine. VHF, of course. And brand new sails. If you want the boat, it costs 120.000 Everything you could dream of, You shouldn't miss this oportunity. I just wish my wife could see it. T'll give you some advice. When you look at a sailboat, check the finish. That's the first to go. Look here, an even, dark color. Shiny on top. All new ropes. - T'll call him back. - As I was saying... You have reached Ida Birkeland. Please leave a message. S0? What did the dragon say? What? This is a hands- on project at all times. It's important you get support from home. Of course. Hello! Sorry, I'm late. Crabs? - Haven't you eaten? - No. I was waiting for you. - How nice. - You must be starved. - Yes. Are they both sleeping? - Yes. Well done! - I've got something to tell you. - Me, too. Guess what I've done. I said it first! - I don't know. Guess what I've done. - It's a surprise. Look. - Barcelona? - Yes, this weekend. - You just did this without asking? - It's just you and me. - But we can't. - Why not? I've taken care of everything. Agnete is babysitting. We can just go. - Yes. - Yes. But I've bought us a boat. - Don't kid around. - It's true. It's beautiful. Perfect for the four of us. - Tell me you're kidding. -I'm not. You're insane. Doesn't it cost 120.000? - 115, - Have you done it? - Ida, can't we talk about it? - You can't just go and do that. - Let's talk calmly about this. - Now way! - You're not allowed. - Not allowed? - Did you sign the contract? - Yes. - It's not your money. - No, itis ours. You have any idea how much work is involved? You never finish anything. Not one room in this apartment is finished. And when am I supposed to do it? What about your masters thesis? - Damn it. - You never finish... -1 do my best! - What do you think I do? "Men and women are not aware that they have different emotional needs." "Women need understanding, respect and appreciation." "Men need trust, validation and encouragement." "Both mistakenly assume that the other has the same needs and wishes." Ida, I really wanted that boat for us. So we could share something nice. Things are not going well anymore. All we do is fight. I don't know... I can't live like this. If that's the way things are for you, - - then you can just fuck off down to that boat of yours. Where's daddy? - Hello. - Hi. Did you get thrown out? No. We're just remodelling the bathroom. Everything is chaotic. - You're doing it yourself? - Yes. Lots of work. Hei, Mathias. It's me. Can't we just go on that trip? Please. It would be good for us. I meet you at the airport. Agnete is picking the kids up and everything. Please. See you there. Bye. Damn it. This is Ida Birkeland. Our right brain. - Kate Wallin. -Ida. The Lgvenskjold yard. The bank square in Horten. Everything is up here. I know that program very well. T used it when I worked at the headquarters in Berlin. Is it stuck? There. - Thanks. -How nice. - Looks a bit like the Town Hall square. - Do you think so? - Is that what you are trying to recreate? - Not really. I'm trying to do something new. One can always copy something timeless. Super- duper! Kate is in charge of logistics. So let's hope we become good buddies. I studied in Stockholm in the 1980's. Still remember my Swedish, you know, buddy- boy. -So I hear - Thanks, buddy- boy. - Shall we go and talk to Beate and Luigi? - Yes. Nice to meet you. - Same here. - Take care. You do realise I'm building a house? And that I have three children? I know, but we'll be working with the Unemployment agency to find a solution. Final call for SAS Braathen Star Alliance route 5116 to Barcelona. All passengers are requested to proceed to exit 17. The exit is closing. Robert, it's not easy for me, either. I really feel sorry for you, since you are forced to fire me. Enjoy your sailboat. - I used seniority. What would you do? - Fucking ass licker. - Why didn't you show up? - I made it clear I didn't like the idea. - Moving in? - No. Typical that you would think a trip to Barcelona would solve our problems. That's not how I meant it. - Are you planning on living in the boat? - Maybe. For a while. You can't. You have two kids. They can move in here. I've bought sleeping bags. - What are you saying? - T don't know. Listen... It's just you and me. I love you. Baby... Don't you love me anymore? - What do you want me to tell the kids? - That we have to think things through. Mathias, no one breaks up because of a stupid boat. If it was just a stupid boat, maybe you could've let me enjoy it? - I was willing to discuss it. - No, you weren't. - Viggo has read an entire book. - He has? I doubt it was as difficult as this one. Isn't it your bedtime soon? - What does "sad" mean? - "Sad"? (sounds like "semen‚Äù.) If a man and a woman fall in love- - then the man often wants to put the penis in the woman. - And things come out. That's called semen ("sad"). - I thought "sad" meant uhappy. - Unhappy? - In English. - Yes, it can be that, too. - Like in, "I'm very sad." - Mommy and daddy are "sad". What's happened to you? What's happened? If he can't see how much you put into this relationship, he doesn't deserve you. - There's some problem at his job. - If 50, he has to face it. He can't just run off. Its me too. If only I had understood how important this was for him... You're doing it again, taking responsibility for him. How much did the boat cost? - I don't know. 120.000 or something. - 120.0007 Do you have that much? I would've bought a motorcycle instead. You've put up with too much. I couldn't have taken it. I'm pretty glad I'm single. - Typical you. - Well, Tam. You can have sex with who ever you want. And so on... "When a man is under a lot of stress, he pulls back into his inner cave." "He becomes more and more distant, forgetful, rejecting and absent- minded." "She realises that he is upset, but misunderstands." "She expects him to open up and talk about his problems." "Like the Venusians do." - Hi. - Hi. - Cold? - No, no. - Is it your boat? - Yes. Fool. - Hi. - Hi. - Was it nice? - What? - Barcelona. - Yes, very nice. I've calculated Labrador contra Blue Pearl. Great if you could take a look at it. You know, the square in front of the church in Boras, it's Labrador. - T'll look into it later. - Do that. - It won a prize for best public room. - I said I'll look into it later Okay. - Hi. - How are you doing? - I hear you've had some problems. - Some problems? - Difficult woman? - No... I feel a bit silly, but... Any how, Mathias is launching the boat on Friday. He was wondering if it was okay if... Well, he wants the kids to be there. So they can be a part of the big day. So I take care of the everyday life and you take the celebrations? Ida, I don't want to get in the middle of this. Mathias asked if I could talk to you about this. So T am. I see. You can tell him he can't. - My God, Ida. People get divorced. - I'm not divorced. - No. Not technically, any way. - I'm not divorced! Of course you aren't. - We don't finish until 3 oclock. -1 know, but we have... What if every parent did this? - We are launching the boat today. - Today is a bad day, actually. Emil is the head of the green group this week, so it's very important he is here, I understand, but... Emil, get your stuff and come. - We're working on an ecological project. - It's a big day for us, you see. Say bye. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - What about Mommy? - Yes? Mommy's not making the decisions here. Okay. For just this once. Okay. - I want to get in first! - Come on! Erik, there's water coming in! - Lift the boat! - Bring it up! Start the pump! Your sister's here. - What's happened? - I don't mean to bother you, but. Viggo's father has a day cruiser. And now it's all over. I've spent the entire winter in that stupid cabin. - I hate that cabin! - T know. It was supposed to be great for us as a family. Yeah, right! And then he calls and says, "I have to work overtime, dear." Sure! - You don't deserve that. - I thought everything was just fine. - Short way to school. New kitchen... - I have to pick Emil up from school. - What? - Yes, he told me about the boat. It's exciting for Emil. It's so important for him to identify with and be in control of the elements. So I said it was fine. You know, the bonding between father and son. It's top. Tip top. Bye. Male bonding... Mommy! The boat was great! I got to steer. And it almost sank. - No, no, It just needs adjusting. - Daddy got real mad. Just relax. It's just a little leak. We wore life vests and were right by land. Next time you pick them up without clearing it with me... I tried to. Do I need permission to spend time with my own children? I know where you can sleep. The kitchen table folds into a double bed. If you think I'll ever set foot in that boat, you're mistaken. It's up to you. - Say bye to daddy now. - Bye. Your ATM card is now cancelled. Press 1 to return to the main menu. - I know there's money on the account. - That's the fourth time you've tried. Would you mind putting the things back yourself? A lot of customers are waiting. - Step out of the queue, please. - All right. We'll be adjusting the outer fagade elements. Look here, it's not much. And we'll be cutting the edges. It'll give us a much better visual profile, S0 We can create... - What are you doing here? - Collecting my credit card. - You have no right to cancel my card. - You can't use 120.000 without asking. - Give me your purse. - Stop it. - Relax. - Is it any of your business? Are you the great hero who will defend her? - Just take her home and fuck her. - What are you talking about? I can recommend that one. A bit loose in the cunt, but gives good head. Now you've really made a fool of yourself. Bye. I'm on my way. My car was stolen last night. I just have to let the kids off. We'll have to fix this somehow. Let's go into my office. Of course it has to be fixed. The union is strong here, you know. - Just the idea of coming on a Friday... - I used all Sunday to finish the report. - It's your job. - Yes. Robert quit on the day. I've tried to clean up after him. Is this my fault now? Your style is just a bit crude. I'm not going to tell you how to solve matters. I think T'll choose Robert's solution. I quit. - No. - I thought we were downsizing? Thanks and goodbye. We manage just fine. Don't we? Just the three of us for a few days. - And your birthday is coming up soon. - Yes. I can't bare being there, knowing that he has had sex with her on our sofa. In my home! That's what hurts the most. And Stian has probably spoken to her about me, too. That's my cup. What is it? Am I boring? Am I... in bed? Oh, Camilla... Emil? Are you eating candy? - Yes, they are. -1 see. - When is Mathias coming home? - He's working on the boat. And he has to think things through. Ida? Why haven't you said anything? - Hi, Ida. - Hi. Good of you to come. Where's Mathias? He was supposed to be here. It's important that both of you are here. - We can just start. - He's been told, so... Well. T guess you know what I wanted to see you about? No. His stuttering. I think I know what it's about. Stuttering? I've never heard him stutter. It's not much, but he said something like, "The b- b- boat is sinking." And, "The p- planets g- go around the sun." Or more like, "Su- su- sun. P- p- planets." Well, maybe not quite so much, but... Anyway, I thought we should take it seriously. Of course. - He didn't show up. - What? - Without any message? - No. Nothing. He must have a good reason. Like he doesn't give a shit that Emil stutters. Listen, Mathias does care for Emil. And for you. - He always lets me down. - So you are not going to try anymore? - I'm not the one who moved out. - You refused to let them go on the boat. - He does what he wants anyway. - Fine. Just get meaner and meaner, so you end up divorced. That's what you want. Hi, daddy! Daddy! - Hello. - Hi. - Did you buy life vests? - No, Camilla did. - Did you wash it? - Yes. Don't step there. Sorry. - Why didn't you come to the meeting? - Emil, put that back. Great. Let it be there. - What meeting? - At the school. I sent an e- mail. - But I have a new mail address. - Why? I quit my job. - What? -1 quit. - You quit? - Don't step there. - Have you gone completely insane? - I think life is more than just work. What are we supposed to do now? Sell the apartment? I can't just sit around and wait. You'll have to make a choice. - What kind of choice? - You'll have to make your mind up. If you think I'm selling this boat then you've misunderstood what this. Hi. Let's see... eggs and tomatoes and beer. They didn't have the aspirin you asked for, s0 I got another type. - Thanks. - See you. Oh, hi. Bye! You've made your choice then. Hi, Ida. Are you working? - Yes. - Is everything alright? - With me? - Yes. Please let me know if there's anything I can help you with. What did you do, when you got divorced? - Formally, you mean? - Yes, or... - Hi. - Are you working as well? Yes, we're just going over the Tjuvholmen project. - Just looking through it. - Without me? - Isn't that my project? - Of course. You're in charge of it all. I just thought you might need some help. Ida! Come here, I've something to tell you. I spoke to Stian. He's coming for us tomorrow. He was so sweet. He cried, Ida. Oh, he loves me! T'll get you some food. What matters is that we have a house and soon two kids. A life together. But we have to get a new sofa. Or at least reupholster the old one. We must be able to forgive each other. That's really important. It's us, you know. - This is what you wanted, wasn't it? - Yes, but mediating is so... Serious? My God, what did you expect? It's all I have. No. You still have the boat. - What? - You still have the boat. - "You still have the boat‚Ñ¢? - Yes. Don't you get what this is all about? The boat. Really... You've never had a relationship that lasted more than two weeks. Fool. - Want another one? - Yes. - Hi. - Hi. You look nice. - That girl by the boat... - Third floor. She could've been my father! I mean, I could have been her father. So, she's not interested? - How's the project at work going? - Are you interested in that now? T've always been. I've just been a bit anoyed that you earn more than I do. - And now you don't earn anything. - I'll get another job. We have Emil and Selma. Can't we talk before going in that office? Ida. Please listen to me. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have bought the boat without your consent. Can't you listen? Please. I'm sorry! T'll sell the boat. If that's what you want. - It's not about that anymore. - What is it you want then? Read this. Ida... "When one is upset, disappointed, frustrated or angry- " "- it's hard to communicate in a friendly manner." "When negative emotions arise- " "- it's easy to loose feelings like trust, understanding and respect.‚Äù There's something we need to talk about, Emil. Mommy and daddy are not boyfriend and girlfriend anymore, Like, you prefer to be with Viggo, right? While last year you enjoyed staying with Truls more. Grown ups are like that too. We also change. A lot. Sometimes it's best for all that mommies and daddies don't live together. That doesn't mean that they don't love their kids. - You see? - Yes. It has nothing to do with the children. Do you understand what I'm saying? Mommy and daddy may have behaved a bit stupid towards each other lately. You can be stupid with Selma sometimes. It doesn't mean you don't love her, - Do you understand what I am saying? - Yes. Me and daddy love you just as much as we always have. - You know that, right? - Maybe daddy is gay? No, he's not. - Are we poor now, mommy? - No. Ida! What? What do you want? She didn't need the Corolla. - I've got to go. - You have to go? To the bathroom. Ok. Why can't you stop following me if you don't have a damn thing to say? Stop it! The kind of women you hang out with, it's embarrassing. Small girls like that. You're fucking pathetic. Just a minute. Can't we just move on? Can't I, without you fucking invading my life? You ruin everything! Just fuck off! Ida? - Don't. - You're not ready for this. Fuck me. Please. You're not ready for this. Know what I mean? No. Yes. Okay. - Hi. - Hi. - You're still the perfect father, - I don't think so. Are you alright? Well, you see... Ida and I have agreed to... - What can I say? - What can you say? I'm divorced, too, 50 I know what you mean. Look at them. Hello! They play well together, It's a fine place to live. Do you want a beer? Mathias, could you rub me on my arm a little? - Alittle harder, - Like this? Rub my neck a little. Like that. Perfect. More. - Scratch my back with your nails. - Like this? Harder, Like that. Yes. Quch. Don't bite! - They're really pleased! - Then I'm happy. - Can I see your sketches? Nice. - Should we celebrate? - I feel sick. - It'll pass when we get to the boat. - Linn, look, there's Emil. - Hi. - I tried to call you. - What? - You didn't answer your cell phone. - Yeah, I saw your number came up. Why do you think I went with you in the boat? Just forget that number, Come, Linn. Impotent fucking asshole. - Hi. - Hi. Wow! Check it out. Pine doesn't go out of style. I was thinking laidback funky. Rocky fusion, hippy chic. - It's more like rocky horror picture show. - Isn't it called "shabby chic"? "Number four: Put the screw in from behind." - Are you that far yet? - We have to do it properly. You suggested we should work instead of drink. I said we could do both. - Even I see that the one ontop is... - Yeah, it's a bit crooked. Don't play with that. - It's not just yours. - Yes it is. Just daddy's. It's mommy's too. - It's ugly here. - Don't say that. It's nice here, isn't it? - You're stupid. - Fine. Don't wake up... - I want to sleep at mommy's. - Come, I'll show you where we're going. Viggo's father has a new girlfriend from Poland. There. We'll put that here. Don't play with it, okay? - What's a leverage? - Take a sip. - You can drink 5 units a week. I Promise! - No, a day. Why did you buy an Ivar shelf? Billy shelves are a lot nicer. Okay, let's take a break. - I think... ouch! - Are you all right? - Where is he? What happened? - He's fine. He'll be fine. He cut his main artery with the drill. Totally idiotic. It's my fault. I wasn't paying attention. I went on deck to fix some stupid ropes. I'm sorry. You're going to be just fine, sweety. - You're birthday's coming up soon, too. - Yes, it is. How do we do that? I don't know. - Let's do something fun. - Maybe in the boat? I don't think that's such a good idea. - Is that what you really want? - Yes. It's on Mid Summer's Eve, you know. We could be on the quay. Mommy doesn't even have to go on board. Let's do that. Hi, Jon. Hi, Ida. - How's Emil doing? - Fine. Well, better. If you need Kate's help, just ask. She's pretty good with that program. Ove, I'm fine. There's two days left. - Just let me know. - Thanks. A lot is at stake here. For all of us. Come on. - Hi. - Hi. I thought I'd stop by with this. So it's here when he wakes up tomorrow. - It's heavy. This will make him happy. - Yes. I just wanted him to have it in the morning. Like he's used to. - See you tomorrow, then. Bye. - Bye. - Wait. - Yes? Why not sleep over on the sofa? Then you'd be here when he wakes up. For his sake, I mean. - For his sake, yes. - Yes, of course. - That's probably a good thing. - Yes. It's what he's used to. I'm on my way to bed now, anyway. - Comein. - Thank you. Sorry, I was just. - Are you shy? - Yes, maybe a little. - Can I ask you something? - It depends. Have you had sex with anyone else? - No. Not that it's any of your business. - No. "Deep inside a man is afraid that he is not good enough." "He's afraid of failure. The woman misinterprets the man's silence." "She thinks he doesn't like or love her" Happy birthday to you! Happy Birthday to you... Daddy! - A telescope! - It's from mommy and daddy. - Together. - From the both of us. We're done with that now, so hand me the balt. Mommy has to go to work now. Have the best birthday ever. See you tonight at the party, right? I'm looking forward to it. See you on the boat sweetheart. Bye! - Should we just slam the door shut? - Yes. That's fine. Bye. Just give me... - Problems? - No, I'm fine. - You must save often or you get trouble. -T'm in control! - Happy birthday to Emill - I have to finish here first, Is it your birthday? Just let me know if you need help. - I've put on the purple. -It's a kid's party... - Is he seven or eight? - Six. Let's talk later, Agnete. Bye. Hi. Yes. What? Birthday candles. Yes, okay. T'll be there soon. I'm almost done. - Was that mommy? - Yes, she's on her way. Yes, yes, yes! - Beer at a children's party? - Please help your self. - Didn't you bring Tonje? - No. That didn't last. - I've decided to take it easy now. - Oh yeah? Skip all women stuff and take it easy. Ida, tomorrow will be great! A lot of people are coming. - Are you ready? - Yes. Keep up the good work! Hi. I'm just about done. Maximum another half hour. - Why is everything upside down? - That's how telescopes are. But when you look at the stars, it doesn't matter. Viggo! - Happy birthday! - Thanks. - How are you? - I'm allergic to strawberries and nuts. - And no lactose. - Fine. Welcome. Kate? First of all, we'll have to get this transferred to another computer. - That'll take half of the night. - Tt will. But it will work. What the hell do you want me to say? Emil is asking for you. Everyoneis. - Where's your mommy, Emil? - She'll be here soon. Two hours ago you said you were in the taxi. Damn it! What are you doing? Hello? - Who's birthday is it? - My son's. - The one who cut his artery? - Yes. Emil. Ida. You have to go. T'll fix this. The job is already done. T'll take care of the rest. Yes. I can do it better than you. - But it has to be finished tonight. - I mean it. Go. Gol Be on your way. Run. Bye! - Ida? - Happy birthday to you... - Camilla, shut up a little. - Are you having fun? We can sleep by our islet. And sail on tomorrow. Can we call her? Well... We're out of range here. And I packed away the phone. Emil. She had to work. That's the way things are sometimes. - Stupid job. - Yes. Mathias. Hi, Emil! Sorry, sorry, sorry! Where are you? Mommy's coming now. I promise. I do. - Where's Mars? - Do you see the big star up there? The two tiny ones next to it? Under them, the planet that's a bit red, that's Mars. Where is Venus? We can't see Venus now. You can only see it in the morning. - Can we see it tomorrow? - No. I expect we'll be sleeping then. We can get up early another day. - Don't they ever see each other? - Who? - Mars and Venus. - I don't know. - Mathias, this was an exception. - There've been a lot of them lately. I know. But I want that to change now. I don't know, Ida. I have trouble trusting you right now. - I have to call Kate. - Are you calling work now? Yes. There's one final thing I have to fix before tomorrow. I understand that this makes problems. But I want to stay here. The job is done. It's just the presentation left. You can manage it. I understand, but T don't want to. I want to stay here. Tell the mayor I said hello. Can I sleep on board? - Good morning. - Where are we? Isn't this where you're supposed to be? Goon. This is how we envision the neighbourhood around this square. But no matter how perfect we create it, it's the people that bring it to life. Because that's what people do. This was a collaboration and our entire office has contributed. A special thanks to Kate Wallin, you are simply fantastic. I also want to thank the man that has been by my side and sometimes hasn't. The one that means everything to me and that I can't afford to loose. Mathias, I love you.
