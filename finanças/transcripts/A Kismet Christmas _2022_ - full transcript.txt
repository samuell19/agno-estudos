But when they get to the stone wall, two things happen at the same time... Doyle steps out of the shadows, looking for a fight... and Isabella feels her kismet fading." That's it! Your exclusive sneak preview of book two. You're the first to ever hear it. I know, I know you're so eager for the next book, but all I can say is... it's coming soon. If I say any more, that man over there, my agent, Benny, will yell at me. She's right. I will. But I'm not all bad, because... I have some very exciting news about the Isabella Christmas contest. So many of you guys wrote in and I'm thrilled to announce that Sarah has chosen a winning letter. She'll be traveling to the winner's home town to announce their name, so, people of... New Britain, get ready, because Sarah Grace is coming! Wow. New Britain? Maine? New Britain. Maine. Okay, if anybody wants their book signed, come on up here! Hi! What's your name? Thank you so much. We had a blast. Okay, I saw your face. What's with New Britain? How big of a problem? Uh, it's kind of a big problem. New Britain is my hometown. Sort of. Well, you've never said anything about this before. Well, it ended badly. How badly? Are you sure you want to hear this? Oh, I think I need to hear every last juicy detail. It was Christmas... ...and, like always, I went to my grandmother's in New Britain. I was... a late bloomer, but I had a deep, deep crush on the boy next door. Ooh! I love where this is going. Miss Raylene! A kismet cookie? I thought you were married. Wait! Wait, wait, wait. Are you saying kismet cookies are real? Benny... I'm telling you this story once. You can listen, or you can interrupt. Sorry, sorry. Keep going. I'll have you know, this cookie is for my niece... who can't see a good man if he's standing right in front of her. What Raylene means is, she's sticking her nose where it doesn't belong... again! What about you, Miss Patsy? No cookie for you? Sarah Collins, you just arrived, and already with the sass? We missed you, Sarah. Now, get inside. Your Gramma Mia's been baking all day, and she needs you. Okay. Hey! What? Sounds like you need some silicone spray on those hinges, Sarah-Bear. You know what? You could stop calling me that at any time, 'cause I knew it was a dog, not a bear. Oh, sure you did. That's why you broke the land-speed record getting inside, screaming, "Bear! Bear! Bear!" You done? How's your best-seller going? Oh, it's... you know, whatever. I... Well, if you need any help brainstorming ideas, you just holler at me, okay? Okay. Wait, no way! You're selling Night Runner? Yup. Time to grow up, get something a little more practical. You? Grow up? That'll be the day. Hey, Sarah-Bear. I'm onto you, Travis Walker! Gramma Mia! Oh! - Hello! - Oh, ho, ho! Welcome home, darling! Oh. Oh! - Merry Christmas. - Oh, Merry Christmas! Okay, well, don't just stand there. Get yourself an apron and help me with all of this. - Okay. - Oh! You can start by taking those out and put the fresh ones in. - Okay. Have you called the police? 'Cause this place looks like a crime scene. Oh, you know that it's only on Christmas Eve that my kitchen looks like this. Okay. How long do I set the timer for? Read the recipe! Oh. The recipe says "take them out when they seem done." That's right. You know how this works. The kismet doesn't happen unless you really believe in the magic. Oh, no, no! Don't peek! Use your heart, not your eyes. Okay. Sorry. I saw Travis on my way in. Oh? Did he tell you his news? Yeah. I can't believe he's selling it. That car's like his baby. I'll get it! Oh. Hi, I'm Helen. Hi. I'm Mia, and this is my granddaughter, Sarah. Are you here for a kismet cookie? I guess so. My friend Angie says... I don't know. I'm not a big believer in this kinda stuff. Well, why don't I tell you the legend, and then you can decide for yourself? Okay? Come on in. So, a hundred years ago, my great-grandparents moved here, and they bought this house, and before long, there was a wealthy man in town who wanted to marry their-their daughter... my Nana Sue. Now, the man was very nice, but Nana Sue didn't love him. And Nana Sue promised her answer by Christmas, and on Christmas Eve, she bumped into this wall and discovered this hidden cabinet, and, inside, she found the recipe for kismet cookies. It said, if you follow the recipe exactly, you'll dream of your true love. So she made the cookies, and wrapped one and put it under her pillow, just like the recipe told her to. And that night, she dreamt about the grocer in town who always made her laugh. So the next morning, she marched into town and she knocked on his door, and she wanted to know if he had anything to say to her, and it turns out, he did. He'd always loved her... ...But he didn't think he could compete with the wealthy man. So, then, two weeks later, they were married... my Nana Sue and my Grampa Joe. And ever since then, the cookies have worked. Okay. I'm sold. It goes under my pillow? Uh-huh. Tonight. You'll see. - Mm-hmm. What's Travis up to out there? Nothing. I don't know. Just, I guess fixing my car. Well, um, this is the last kismet cookie of the year. Gramma! Are you looking for love? Oh! No, honey. No, you know your grandpop was my one-and-done. The cookie just helps me dream about him. I wish you'd let me try it. Oh... I know you do, sweetheart, but... ...it's too soon. This is the time of your life when you should be writing about crushes and sweeping romantic stories in your journal. Besides, it doesn't matter. We've given away all the other cookies. Tomorrow's Christmas! Oh! Sarah! Merry Christmas. What would you like for breakfast? I can make you... Don't be mad, but I saved a kismet cookie for myself. I put it under my pillow last night... ...and I know who my true love is. Oh, Sarah. Sarah, wait! Travis. Hey, Sarah, what are you doing here? I need to tell you something. Can it wait? You know the kismet cookies? Yeah. Yeah, well, last night, I put one under my pillow. I know I wasn't supposed to, but I did, and I dreamt about you... and that means that you're my true love, and we're supposed to be together, and I know how that sounds, but I... You're getting married? Yeah... Look, I'm sorry, I should've told you, but... this is a good day for me, okay? B-Be happy for me. Sarah? Sarah! I'm sorry, honey. Oh! Sarah, I-I understand. I do. And I hate that it broke your heart, but... ...be absolutely sure that you don't believe in the kismet anymore before you do that. So kismet cookies are real? No. Clearly, they're not. It's a fairytale I believed in as a kid, and it gave me the idea for the book, but instead of predicting love, in the book, the cookies turn you into a mini-superhero. 'Cause that's what I needed to be at the time... strong and confident. So what happened? The next time you saw the boy next door? Oh, I didn't. My dad got there soon after, I begged him to take me away, so we went to a ski lodge. Gramma Mia says they moved to Florida a few years ago. And you haven't been back to New Britain since? No. Okay. As your agent, I'm going to advise you never to tell this version of the kismet story to anyone. Can we please pick a new winner? No. It's too late. We've already told the mayor of the town, and he wants to announce it at some "Christmas in the Park" thing. Dickens. Huh? "Dickens in the Park." A Christmas Carol? Dickens? New Britain? Get it? Everyone dresses up! - Love that. - Wait. Do they know that Sarah Grace the author is really Sarah Collins? Well, I haven't told anyone, so, unless Gramma Mia has... Gramma Mia doesn't tell anyone anything, clearly. Perfect! So there's no problem. You... can go do the Dickens thing on Saturday, you can head over to Gramma Mia's place, lock yourself in, she can feed you, and you can crank out book number two. I know. I know. First draft by January third. Don't make it sound unreasonable, my friend. They have given you two very generous extensions. And I'm close. I swear! I'm 80% done. I just... need to figure out the ending. Sarah, is that you? Oh, my gosh! Welcome home. Thank you. And thanks again for keeping this low-key. What? What? - Is that our girl? Oh, look at you! It's so many years! Oh, my g... You've got to come by the candy shop and see all the changes I made. And I haven't been able to tell any of my customers I know the great Sarah Grace. - Oh... - And you know how hard it is for me to keep a secret. I've been in such a state! You, I mean... It's officially a time capsule. Sarah! Get dressed. We're leaving soon. Here we go. Oh, my gosh. Oh, wow! Oh, it looks incredible. It's exactly the same. We're here! We couldn't get my hat to stay on! It kept flying off like a Frisbee. So, are you ready for this? Me? No, I'm never ready. No. But my alter-ego Sarah Grace is just fine. Which reminds me, I need to take a photo for Benny. - Oh! - Everybody, get in! Patsy... get in there! Thank you. Perfect. Okay. Is that Mayor Schebly? Oh, yes. That's our mayor. Right, Patsy? Hello, hello, hello, ladies and gents! Okay. Cover me. I'm going in. Okay. Merry Christmas! And now the moment you've all been waiting for... here she comes... Sarah Grace, author of Isabella's Kismet Cookies! We are so excited to have you here in New Britain. And you came all dressed up! Of course! Thank you so much for the warm welcome. I'm so pleased to be here. Ooh... is that... what I think it is? It is. As you know, children from all over the country wrote in, telling me about projects they wanted to do that reflected Isabella's spirit... and the winner's name is in this envelope. Would you do the honors? I would love to. Ahem! Are you ready? And the winner is... Jasmine Walker! - Yes! Come on over here! Hi, Jasmine! I loved your letter, and your book project sounds like it embodies everything I hoped Isabella would mean for kids your age. I love you so much! Jazzy's... Jazzy's had her fingers crossed ever since we found out the winner was from New Britain. Father Christmas is my dad. Sarah Grace, Jazzy, would you be willing to pose for a picture for our local paper? Of course! Jasmine... wait, do you go by "Jazzy"? Yeah. Well, you first, Jazzy. Come on! Let's go! Okay... settle in... All right, camera's over here, Father Christmas, okay? All right, and everybody say "Merry Christmas!" Merry Christmas! Yes! Thank you, Sarah Grace, and thank you, Jazzy. Good job, Jazzy. Oh, thank you, thank you. I remember that smile. Hey, Sarah-Bear. Sarah? Sarah... Oh! Sarah, please don't leave. Oh... you said you'd stay for Christmas. And you said they were in Florida! No, I said Mr. and Mrs. Walker were in Florida. Can you split that hair any finer? Uh... Sarah... Sarah, I-I realize you're still upset, but, darling, it was a lifetime ago. If it makes you feel better, Mia didn't even tell me about the wedding either. I get not telling Raylene, but me? Ha! Say what, now? Sarah, wait. It was Travis's story to tell, and he should have told you. He had a lot on his mind, and probably had no idea you were nursing a little crush on him. - Okay... - And, plus, I didn't expect you to hide that cookie, a-and... Well... It's all in the past, darling, and this year, more than any other year, I want to have Christmas in this house. W-What do you mean, "more than any other year"? Come in! Sarah! Oh! Where'd you go so fast? I can't believe we're neighbors. We are? Wow. Oh, that's news to me too. Yeah, I bought the place from my parents when they retired. It's just the easiest thing for all of us. Right. Is that yours? Are you leaving already? Um... No. No. Um, I... I... haven't unpacked yet. Yeah. I have to carry this upstairs. I can help you. Oh! You... I... Okay, Jazzy. Jazzy. I got that. You take the little one. There you go. This is really unnecessary. Okay. Roasted chestnuts still your favorite? They are. Thank you. Go ahead. You can ask her. Ask me what? Would you help me with a book project? The one that I wrote to you about? Books for kids? That's one of my favorite things. I go to the library every week. Did you used to go there when you lived here? The library? All the time. But I didn't live here, Jazzy. I just visited for Christmas and in the summers. I stayed here with Gramma Mia, and because she was a teacher, we had the same time off. Where was your mom? She died when I was very young. Jazzy? Remember that conversation we had about other people's business not really being yours? Sorry. That's okay. Hey. Do you want to show me the way to your project? Yeah. When you were little, did you and my dad play together? Sometimes, but your dad is a lot older than I am. Four years is not a lot older! It's a lot. He looks way older than you. He does, doesn't he? But, to be fair, the beard isn't helping. Yeah. Too early for wine? That's a rhetorical question, right? Red, or white, or... both. - Yeah. Come on. Everything's in here. Sarah? Um... Nice save with the suitcase... but I get it. I don't blame you for wanting to leave. I'm sure this was all a bit of a surprise to you. But thank you for staying. It means a lot. To Jazzy. Mm. Jazzy's mom? Oh... well... Come on, you two! Okay! Just a second! Just gotta get out of these scratchy Father Christmas duds. What? Don't look at me like that. Let me try it. How do I look? What do you think? Runway model, hmm? Gorgeous. Oh, it looks better on you, even. Daddy, when you were little, did you really let a skunk in the house? I sure did. Right through the front door. Why? Beats me. Who knows why eight-year-old boys do anything. The skunk was on the front porch, I opened the door, he strolled right in. And that skunk was the worst thing I've ever smelled in my entire life. But that wasn't our only close encounter with nature, was it, Sarah-Bear? Why do you call her that? Hey! Let's work on your project first, and then we can tell more embarrassing stories. Okay! If I remember from your letter, your project makes it easy for families to donate books at Christmas. Yep. It's called "Let's Read at Christmas." - Good name! - The kids of New Britain donate books to kids from our sister city, who aren't as lucky. They don't have a huge library like we do. And what are these ornaments we're cutting out? Kids decorate them, and put the name of their gift book on the back. And then they hang them on the Christmas tree in the community center. Families can pick one. Or two. Or three! And buy the book to donate. The books get wrapped and donated on Christmas Eve. And who's wrapping all these books? Well, Jazzy is very good at volunteering my time. No, I noticed that, Father Christmas. Exactly. And where are you getting all the books? Are you working with Miss Raylene? Mm-hmm. Miss Raylene's already picked up a bunch of the most popular titles, and she'll grab some more once she finds out what the kids ask for. She's selling them all at cost, which is great, so... Well, I can talk to my agent, Benny. I'm sure he can overnight a stack of books. Really? That would be great. Well, it's good to be Sarah Grace. Do the book people know your real name? They do. But why do you use Sarah Grace instead of Sarah Collins? Oh. Um, well, when people ask me that, I tell them that Sarah Grace just sounds more... elegant, but the truth is, I first had the idea for the book when I was only 17, and I was very... awkward? No. And very lonely, and... I just wanted to be someone else... ...someone who went through life with a lot more grace than I did, so I created an alter ego so I could pretend to be someone who was confident and funny and graceful... and just not at all lonely. But why were you lonely? A... a lot of reasons. But here's the funny part. It all worked out. And without it, I never would've written Isabella. up, Benny. So the boy next door is still next door? Is he still breathtakingly handsome? Even more so. Oh, and you'll never guess who his daughter is. Stop. The contest winner? Ding-ding-ding! Of course she is. Well, this just gets better and better. I'm gonna need to see pictures. No. I cannot make that promise. All right, I gotta go. All right. Well, I'm here if you need me. Bye. Would you like to stop at Patsy's shop with me? Is that even a question? Ho, ho. Oh, it looks exactly the same! Mm-hmm. And everything tastes just as good as it always did. Well, I don't know if I trust you on that. I think further testing might be required. Chocolate peppermint fudge. I tweaked my recipe last Christmas. Mm! This one may be my favorite yet! Oh, ho. Darling, you have said that about every one. And I've meant it! Miss Patsy, nothing compares to your candy. Come on, spill. What's your secret? Oh, that's easy. I use the best chocolate, real vanilla, and, of course, my secret ingredient. What's your secret ingredient? Love. "Love"? That's your secret? Yes. Love. When people cook or bake these days, they've gotta do it as fast as possible so they can get to the 20 other things that need doing, right? But not Patsy. She has a close personal relationship with everything she makes. Especially the fudge. Well, there is love in this cookies-and-cream. I can tell you that. Believe me... if there's love, there's no magic, honey. Just like the kismet cookies... well, that and the fact that there's, you know, something a little mysterious about you Collins women. Or maybe magic just doesn't exist. Honey, just because you had a dud batch doesn't mean that other people haven't found true love. Maybe you were just too young, or maybe... because you weren't exactly honest with your gramma, you neutralized the magic somehow. Well, whatever happened, it's gone now. So, uh, you two ready to meet Raylene for a little tea time? Mm-hmm! "God bless us, everyone." - Very Dickens. - Classic. All right, ladies. Let's hear it. What is the dumbest thing you ever did for love? Sarah, you can sit this one out, because we already know about you already. Oh, everyone's favorite wedding crasher, that's me. - Oh... - Okay. I went up to a boy that I barely knew, in front of his friends, and I told him that he's gonna marry me because I put a cookie under my pillow and then I had a dream about him. - Oh... - Gramma, that same move didn't exactly work for me. Well, these cookies don't come with a guarantee. I don't think I've ever done anything really stupid for love. What? Don't worry about that. There's still time. Hello, ladies. Ahem. - Oh! - Hi. Speak of the devil. Sarah Grace... you're just who I've been looking for. I come, hat in hand, to ask if you would mind being part of our holiday scavenger hunt tomorrow. Scavenger hunt? Oh, yes! You could be the answer to one of the clues! Yeah! - People get a list of riddles to solve, and then they take a picture of the answer, and the first person to take all the correct photos wins. Fun! I'd love to help. Where should I hide? Well, my bookstore isn't on the list yet. Perfect. Can you be there at ten? - Absolutely. - Thank you. Oh, Albert, before I forget... I've got your favorite... cookies and cream. Thank you. That's, uh... I really need to figure out a way to pay you back for all the sweets you give me. Oh! Maybe you could invite her to dinner. All righty, then! See you at the scavenger hunt tomorrow. See you. Oh! You guys! Stop it. We have a definite "maybe"! To the dinner! - Dinner! - To the dinner. In my defense, Jazzy, it was very dark, and Boomer was a large black dog, so he looked just like a bear, and he was running directly towards me. Jazzy, I have seen Olympic-qualifying track meets where people did not run as fast as Sarah did, okay? Is that where you got the idea for the bear character in Isabella? It sure is. I can't wait for you to finish the next Isabella book. You and me both. Hey. Who's that? She's new in town. I'm gonna go say hi. Do you know who that is? You don't suppose she's telling her that I'm Sarah Grace and my grandmother lives across the street? Probably... seeing as how she's told everybody else in town. You know, maybe you should start wearing sunglasses and then... I can walk in front of you and be like... "Excuse me, excuse me. Miss Sarah Grace has no comment at this time." That would be perfect. That'll be really good. Okay. So, Jazzy has been writing Isabella stories. Dad! What? Look, I'm just glad that someone's giving Isabella some new adventures. Is that okay? To write stories? I mean, no one else reads them. Of course! It's called "fan fiction." I used to write a lot of it when I was your age, especially about my favorite book. A Wrinkle In Time. Sorry, how do you remember that? I was your sounding board, remember? Well, yeah! When Sarah would get stuck, we'd go to the end of the pier and just talk the story out. We spent a lot of time brainstorming. Did you help write the stories? Me? No, no. I just listened. That's not true. You gave suggestions sometimes. Yeah, but you would never take them. Well, I didn't say they were good suggestions. - Hey... - Wait. How do you know that I never took them? Because I read every single one of your stories. What? Yeah, don't you remember? You kept 'em in a notebook in that tree in the backyard. You mean the book marked "Private, keep out... especially Travis"? That's the one. I thought you meant some other Travis! Oh. Oh, I see. Uh-huh. Sarah, are you coming to the scavenger hunt tomorrow? Well, I'm in the scavenger hunt, so I'll see you there. If you can find me. All right, kiddo, it's getting pretty late. Why don't you head home, get into some PJs, and I'll be right there, okay? Can we have book time? One chapter. Look both ways when you're crossing the street. Got it, Dad. You say that every time! When she started reading on her own, we kinda missed our nightly book time, so now we... we read side by side. That is unbearably sweet. Yeah, but we blow through books at a crazy rate. Thank goodness for library cards, huh? Yeah, if only you'd used the library instead of reading my notebook when it was very clearly marked "Not for Travis." You wanna know the crazy thing? Your fan fiction was so good that I ended up checking out the original books at the library. You are actually the reason I got my first library card. Oh, um... You know, Sarah, I just wanted to say that... Come on, Dad! These books aren't gonna read themselves! Who is this kid? Don't ask me. She's all you. Yeah, I know. Okay. I'll see you tomorrow? Yeah. Yeah. 'Cause I live... I'm staying here... - Right. - And you're, uh... - Okay. - Okay. Hear ye, hear ye! Welcome to the Christmas Scavenger Hunt! Hurry up and grab a piece of paper, if you don't already have one. Now, you know the rules. Follow the clues, take a picture of each answer. Where's Sarah? Well, she could be anywhere. That's part of the fun. Okay, look at the first clue. "The teller of stories..." - That's her. - Mm-hmm. "...in the place filled with stories." She's totally there. Totally. The first team back with a complete set of photographs... ...wins a pound of assorted fudge from the Candy Corner. I want that fudge! That fudge is ours. On your marks... We got this. Get set! Go! Okay, okay, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming. Hey. Knew I'd find you here. Where's Jazzy? She's looking for you, tearing the place up. It's just as good as I remember. Ah! Looking for a little inspiration? Always. But I do have a few ideas, which is exciting. That is exciting. I mean, it makes sense. When you were in New Britain last time, you got inspired for the book, so now that you're back in town, maybe it'll inspire you again. Gotcha! Take our picture, Dad. Please? Okay, good job. Well, get the whole team. All right. Say "cheese"! Cheese! Did you let them follow us? Have I taught you nothing about competitive scavenger-hunting? I'm sorry. I tried to throw them off our trail. All right, well, you're grounded. Okay, what's the next clue? "A red wreath where you might find a spotted dog." Fire station! Shh, shh. Fire station. Go, go, go, go, go! - Good luck. - Bye! Come on, Dad! Nice mini-van. Hey, now! Moon Boat is a great ride. "Moon Boat"? Yeah. 'Cause she's the color of the moon, about as big as a cruise liner, so "Moon... Boat." Get it? Mm. Mm-hmm. Hey, are you coming to the community center later? Father Christmas is gonna be there. Then I'll definitely be there. Plus, I have to see how Jazzy's book tree's going. Oh, yeah. She is convinced that, out of all the ornaments on that tree, you are going to pick hers. Well, I will do my best. Good. Here's a pro tip. Hers has a big glittery "J" on it. That should do it. Thanks. Hey, Sarah-Bear! Oh... I'm still onto you, Travis Walker. One thing they don't tell you about owning a house is that you will be constantly cleaning the kitchen. I mean, even if no one's home, you'll be cleaning the kitchen. Well, I've heard that, in some parts of the world, people can leave a dirty spoon in the sink for up to 30 minutes, and the Earth just continues to spin on its axis. Oh! That is absolutely not true. I mean, civilization as we know it would end. Uh... are these your cookbooks? Oh, yeah. Uh, yeah. Take whichever ones you want. Well, why are you decluttering? I just... I have too much stuff. So, are you rekindling things with Travis? There's no rekindling. Something has to be kindled in the first place before it could be rekindled. Hmm. Hey, Sarah! Please thank your agent for me. Five monster boxes of books arrived today. Oh, good. I'm glad a lot of them are Isabella. Now that everyone knows that Sarah Grace is our hometown hero, they're even more popular! Do you want to come by later and sign some of them? - I can do that. - Oh, that's-- Miss Raylene? Hmm? What's the story with the mayor and Miss Patsy? Those two. They were high-school sweethearts, and then Patsy left, went off to college, started her career. The mayor lost his wife a few years back, so he came home to New Britain. There's serious chemistry there. That's the problem. They're such great friends, I think both of them are worried about torpedoing their friendship. Mm. I tell you what... I wish there was some way you Collins women could make those kismet cookies again this year. Then maybe we would find out once and for all. - Mm-hmm. - Ah. Excuse me. Jazzy! Oh. Your tree is a hit. I want to give someone a book for Christmas. Can I pick one? - Yeah. - Yeah? I think... I... want... this one! That's mine. Is it, seriously? Let's see what book you asked for for Christmas. Isabella's new book? I know you can do it. You're the best writer in the world. "...and it was always said of him that he knew how to keep Christmas well, if any man alive possessed the knowledge. May that be truly said of us..." "...and all of us. And so, as Tiny Tim observed..." Everyone? "God bless us... every one!" Merry Christmas! Ho, ho, ho. Excellent work. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Oh! - Great work, Daddy! Thank you, Jazzy. And that concludes my duties as Dickens Day Father Christmas. I will be very happy to let somebody else wear this itchy thing next year. But you've become so civic-minded. Parenthood, man. All right, I'm gonna go get changed. I'll catch you later? Hope so. 'Kay. My name's Helen. You probably don't remember me. No, I remember you. You came by for a cookie. Yeah! You know, I was skeptical about the kismet. Sleep with a cookie under my pillow? That's just goofy! But I did it. And I dreamed of my husband that night... ...so when I met him the next year, I knew he was the one. - Really? - Mm-hmm. And you have a little one? Two children! Christopher's in the candy shop with my mom. And that's July. Congratulations. Thank you. I cannot believe that crazy cookie worked, but it did. It was magic. I just wish your grandmother hadn't stopped making them. We need all the kismet we can get. Thank you. Come on in. Oh, what are you doing? Oh, these are some... not even all... of the books that Jazzy brought home for her project. She was bravely trying to wrap them, she got about three in, and then fell fast asleep on the table. I just put her down, actually. Oh, okay, well, give me some paper. I can help. - Okay. Great. Thank you. - Yeah. We don't have the Isabella books yet because Miss Raylene said you were going over tomorrow to sign them. Yes. I am, I am, but I need to talk to you. What am I supposed to do about this? Jazzy wants to gift the new Isabella book, and I don't know, wrapping up a little "I.O.U." feels like a major Scrooge move. Okay, well... this may be a radical idea, but hear me out on this. Okay. Jazzy doesn't always have to get exactly what she wants. I know, I know. Crazy idea. But I don't want to disappoint her. Honestly, she was probably just trying to encourage you, not put pressure on you. It just feels like pressure because there's already so much on you. No, here's the thing, Travis. I don't feel inspired much anymore, and if I'm not a writer... I don't know who I am. I can't believe I just confessed that to you. Well... I'm your oldest friend. If you can't tell me, who can you tell? Bet you probably never thought of it that way, huh? No, I didn't. Uh... so, listen. I've got this pound of fudge that we won from the scavenger hunt... Wait. You won? Yeah, of course we won. What, did you doubt us? No, of course not. You want to break into it? I'm good, actually. - Oh, really? Okay... - No, I'm good... yeah, good at breaking into it, yeah. It never ends. Sarah? I, um, I'm gonna go to town to run some errands. Do you need anything? No, I'm good. Thanks. Okay. Gramma Mia? Do you remember Helen? She was the woman who came by for a cookie the last time we made them? Oh. Um... Was she the one that was really skeptical? She was. Yeah. I-I saw her at the Dickens Festival yesterday. Oh. With her husband. The man she dreamt of that night. Hmm. So, um... ...what do you think that means? I mean, if her kismet worked for sure... Then maybe the cookies worked? And I wish that I had never... I feel like... when I ripped up that recipe, I... broke a connection to this town and our house, and even to you. Oh, ho, ho, my Sarah. Are you kidding? Oh, darling. You could never break a connection to me. I love you for ever and ever. And ever. But still... don't mess up my kitchen while I'm gone. Benny. Nice picture. Jasmine is adorable. But listen. We gotta talk shop. I had a meeting with Hal today, and he said if you don't meet the deadline this time... ...I'm sorry, but he's gonna bring in a ghostwriter to finish the book. It's our brainstorming spot. I know. I thought I'd find you here. All these years, and this view hasn't changed. Also, why are you wearing that uniform? 'Cause I work for the forestry service, for six years now. - Oh. - It's my day job. It's how I make a living in between all the volunteering gigs that Jazzy signs me up for. - Huh. - Man, Gramma Mia really didn't tell you anything about me, did she? No. And I think Gramma Mia's keeping more secrets. Is that why you're here? No. I heard from Benny. It's not good. They might hire a ghostwriter. Really? Ooh. That is not good. How close to being done are you? I'm pretty close. I'd say 80%, but the ending does not make sense, and I can't just find it. So, let me get this straight. You decided to tackle this issue by walking down here and not writing? Well, escape has always been my favorite form of self-preservation... as you well know. Oh, I remember. You know... way back then, if you had asked me to predict what your life would become, I could've nailed it. Successful writer, traveling around, beloved. But my life? This is not what I would've predicted. But I'm good... you know? Christmas always makes me sentimental. I'm sorry. How long did your marriage last? Not very long. Where is she now? Crystal is traveling around with her band. Living the life she loves... so am I. But she checks in a lot. Jazzy knows her mom loves her. There're no bad guys here, Sarah. There's just a lot of people who care about one amazing little girl. You turned out to be a good dad, Travis Walker. Thanks. But sometimes I think I try too hard. I mean, I don't have to be "Father of the Year" every year. Right. Well, you have been known to be competitive. Me? Only since birth. Okay, so here's the deal. Jazzy's been invited to a sleepover. It's her first one, and I don't think she should go, 'cause she's too young, but she desperately wants to go. You didn't do sleepovers at that age? Yeah, of course I did, but this is completely different... except for I know it's not. All right. They don't pay me to sit around enjoying the view with a beautiful woman. I'm outta here. Hey. Thanks for the lollipop. Oh, yeah. You bet. Oh, and if you're around later, you could come with as I surrender my innocent child into the hands of complete strangers? I'll be your rock. Thank you. Are you kidding me? Snowball? Man, some people never grow up, I guess. Yeah... that's me. Okay, Jazzy. This is a big moment in your life... Okay, bye! Okay. Well, have fun. But don't be afraid to call me if you feel sc... - I will. Promise! - I love you! Okay! Hey! I am so excited. This is gonna be the best sleepover ever. They're nice people, right? Right? Oh... I ran a background check on the family. - No, you didn't. - I did. I did, and then I ran their prints. - Yeah? - Mm-hmm. The entire family's squeaky clean. Really? No parking tickets? None. Then I called up old friends where they used to live, and I got personal recommendations for all of them. Thank you. She's not gonna last all night. I'm gonna call me around 10:00. - Travis? - Yes? Start Moon Boat and get out of here. You can't stay parked here. It's very creepy. You're right. Okay. I gotta pick up that tree anyways. Wait. - What? - You didn't get a tree yet? N... my Father Christmas responsibilities were greater than expected, so I didn't have time. I'm gonna go get it now, but first, I'm gonna drop you off at home, so you can write. Okay. Fair enough. Wait. Hold on. What? I need you to drop me at the Bookmark instead. I need to sign those books. - Oh, fine. I don't know what I'm gonna do! I'm here! I'm here. What's going on? Slight situation. The mayor invited Patsy to Christmas dinner. Oh, sweet! I mean... not good. Very bad. Well, Albert and I have been best of friends for years now. Okay, well, maybe he's inviting you to join him as a friend, because you're alone and he has a whole turkey. Do you know Ethel Kaye? Owns the jewelry shop? No. Well, she's good people. And she told Mary Alice, who told Carol, who told me that our mayor was shopping for an expensive necklace. Oh... And... that's a bad thing? Well, a necklace is gateway jewelry. I'm sorry... what? It's gateway jewelry! He gives her the necklace. If she likes it, he tries a... bracelet... - Mm. - ...or maybe he ups the ante and goes straight for the diamond ring. Oh! You could be engaged by New Year's! Oh! Raylene... I just... I need to know if-if Albert is-is "The One," or if I'm just some crazy old lady with delusions of finding true love again. Patsy and I were hoping Mia could bake kismet cookies again... just one batch... so she could be sure before she heads over there for Christmas dinner. Unfortunately, I just can't do it from memory. I mean, that was a very complicated recipe. I'm sorry I ripped up the recipe when I was a teenager. Oh, no, that's okay. That's okay, sugar. We know your feelings were bruised, but kismet cookies are a part of Mia, a part of your house, a part of this town, and like it or not, a part of you. I know! But they're also not real. We all know that. Right? Mia? What do you think? I think... ...our house gave Nana Sue that recipe a hundred years ago for a reason. And I think if we're supposed to have that recipe again this year, then... we will. But... But right now, you have a big box of books to sign, so come on, you get started, and the rest of us will wrap as you go. - We will. - Okay. Uh... Right here. "What should we do, Isabella?" everyone asked. Isabella said... ...I don't know. - Hey. - Hi. Christmas crisis. Oh, what's wrong? Uh, Jazzy wants a sweater for Christmas. Okay. But I'm pretty sure the window of time in which, I, as her father, can successfully select her clothing, or anything else, is rapidly closing. Soon, I will know nothing... about sweaters or anything else. Yeah, that's probably accurate. - Yeah. So... - Okay. Option... one. No? - Meh. Okay. Okay. Okay. That's fair. Number... two? Mm... nice sweater. - Yeah? Atrocious color. You could put a golden retriever puppy in this sweater... and it wouldn't look cute. Okay. Well... we're down to... number three? And the third one was just right. - Yeah? - Yeah! Great. Okay. Thank you. Sure. All right, I'm gonna return these other two before the store closes. Thank you. Okay. Uh, you know what? I... I'm not getting any work done here, so I could... come with you? - Okay. - Okay. I mean, returns are, like, they could be really challenging. Okay. Thanks again for this. Of course. And you're sure about the scarf? Absolutely. 100%. She'll love it. But keep the receipt just in case. Oh, did she text you? Not yet. Well, she's not going to. She's having fun! Oh! Christmas trivia. Oh... that gift certificate would make an excellent stocking stuffer for a certain bookworm I know. Okay, well... should we go win it for her? Next category is... Christmas movies! - Ooh! - Number one... Christmas isn't Christmas until Hans Gruber falls from Nakatomi Plaza. Name the movie. Die Hard. So, did you get your tree yet? Mm-mm. I got caught in sweater limbo. It's so weird that you don't have a tree. Are you judging Father Christmas? No, I'm judging a guy who works in the forestry service. I don't know, I feel like maybe you saw a nice tree or two in the past few weeks. I feel like you're taking a tone here. I'm not taking a tone! I think you're taking a tone. Question two... a young boy tries to obtain an article of clothing for his sick mother. Name the movie. Oh, um... The Christmas Shoes. Wait-wait-wait. Are you sure? Isn't it the one where there's, like... Are you... questioning my Christmas movie expertise here? Mm. You're right. You're right. I'm sorry. - Thank you. - Never. Thank you. Ah! Here she is. Text from Jazzy. You ready to go pick her up? "Can I go skating with them tomorrow?" Are you laughing at me? I'm just saying, you know, at the risk of stating the obvious... you've raised a happy, well-adjusted kid who's starting her second decade of life, in which her main purpose is separating from you. Was that intended to make me feel better? 'Cause... Look, I'm just saying... with all the expertise that comes from, you know, never actually having my own kid... maybe you could just... relax a little? I don't know, you're a good dad, and the criteria for that changes over time, and maybe this is one of those times? Okay! Here we go. In this modern-day Dickens tale, Bill Murray plays the star character. Scrooged. It's definitely Scrooged. whd ...something... ...something cool. What's up? Oh, good, you're awake and dressed. It's nine in the morning. Yeah, but I know how you creative types are. Up all night, living on coffee and chocolate. Oh! Well, I know how small towns are. You better be dressed by nine, with the front room picked up. - Hmm! - Hmm. Okay. You're gonna need your coat and your boots. - Wait, what? - Let's go. Where are we going? Well, it's Christmas Eve tomorrow. Yeah? Well, remember that whole "Travis doesn't have a Christmas tree yet" fiasco? Let's go cut one down. Now? What, are you working? - Sort of! - Uh-huh. That's what I thought. - Yeah. Come on. You can help me pick one out. We'll put your boots on on the porch. This is very abrupt. We left town at least half an hour ago. We're passing lots of trees! Lots of trees. I'm just saying. Look, there's a science to this. So, how does this choppy-down tree thingy work? Do we just pick one? "Choppy-down tree thingy"? Writers have a way with words. Well... first... you're gonna need gloves. Look at that. You actually keep gloves in your glove compartment. Yeah. You don't? I live in New York. I don't even have a car. Right. Oh... wow. Travis, this is gorgeous. Yeah, it's nice, huh? Oh. Yeah, and everything's so quiet. Well, if it makes you feel more at home, I could honk the horn, yell at you to get out of the way... Hey! I'm walkin' here! That do anything for you? I'm good, thanks. Okay. Are you sure whoever owns this cabin is cool with us cutting down one of their trees? 'Cause I've seen scary movies that start this way. Oh, yeah. We go way back. He doesn't mind. Come on. Let's go cut down a tree. Okay. And, uh, what's the bear population like here? Asking for a friend. Uh... there's a few. Oh. Do you always cut down your own tree? No, but I started so late this year, I figure I better finish strong, so... Ooh! Oh. That one. Over there. Whoa. You okay? Yeah. I'm fine. Okay. So, uh, which tree did you risk your life for? That one. You sure? A hundred percent. All right. Have at 'er. Oh! You wanted... I just... I don't know if I mentioned, but... in New York, I kind of, like, do writing-based activities-- All right, all right. All right. I see. You sure? It's perfect! It really is a great tree. When my writing career dries up, I could be a lumberjack. Or is it "lumberjill"? Can I show you somethin'? Sure. The reason I know the owner doesn't mind us chopping down a tree is because my great-uncle Steve used to own this place. Oh. So, my uncle Steve passed two years ago. Two years? He must've had a great housekeeper. Uh, well... here, can I take your jacket? Okay. Yeah. Here. Thank you. Travis? Yeah? What's going on? Well, um... I inherited the place. This is yours? It is. But I don't remember you having a family cabin as a kid. Well, my uncle Steve wasn't the friendliest guy, but he worked in forestry, so when I joined up, we became closer, and he left the place to me. Jazzy must love it here. Yeah. She does. Oh, that reminds me. Can I see your phone? Thank you. May I have that back? No, you may not. Travis? What are we doing here? I need to get back and write. Okay, look. Look, look, look. Last night, I was thinking about your writer's block, and I was driving myself crazy trying to think of a way to help you, and this is what I came up with. I don't understand. Look, obviously, I can't finish your book for you, but I can... clear the road. I can feed you, and I can be here to bounce ideas off of, just like we used to. I just figured this was... a lot warmer than our brainstorming bench. But... What? But what about Jazzy? Jazzy? She's ten! She can fend for herself. Gramma Mia's gonna pick her up after her sleepover, they're gonna do some last-minute shopping, and they're gonna help out at the Candy Corner. This whole thing is a group effort, Sarah. But... I don't have my laptop. Well, you didn't have a laptop when you wrote before. I bet you didn't even have it when you wrote Isabella. Well, you're right. I didn't. We're going old-school here, Sarah. And... I picked this up. So we're stocked. What are you doing? Oh, um... I'm making a garland for the tree. It's kind of a family tradition. You're making a garland? Yes, Sarah, I have a daughter now, and I... I do crafts. This... this is me. But quit stalling! Tell me what you got so far. Come on. - Okay, okay! Well... I left off when Roger was having some issues, um... Roger helping Isabella find her kismet was genius. Thank you. What? What? No. Are you kidding? All right! Yes! Yes! Yes. You did it. Congratulations. No. We did it. Thank you. I'm gonna type this up when I get home and send it to Benny in the morning. Okay. Oh, um... ...it's my daughter texting from Gramma Mia's phone, asking me politely where her Christmas tree is. We should to go. Yeah, okay. I'll get the fire. - I'll clean this up. - Okay. It's Christmas Eve, you know? I have a life. No, you don't. Besides, I have a Christmas present for you. You can open it early. What is it? Check your email. Oh, if you were here right now, I would hug you! Can you read it right away? Because I think it's good, but I'm a writer, so I'm also needy and thin-skinned. Yes, you are, and yes, I can. Okay, bye. Wait, wait, wait! Wait. Did Travis help with this? He took me to a charming cabin in the woods, confiscated my phone, and fed me fudge and coffee 'til I was done? That man is a walking, talking chef's kiss. So maybe that cookie was right after all. Read the book, Benny. Reading! Right now. You should see our Sarah. You'd be so proud of her. And she's here for Christmas. Oh, I miss you every day. Oh... good morning, darling. Morning, Gramma. I get a little sentimental on Christmas Eve. Um, listen, I have some errands to run, but I won't be gone long. -'Kay. Okay. Oh, Raylene called. Patsy's in a tizzy. She doesn't know what to bring to the mayor's house, so, uh, duty calls. Okay, see you later. See you. Okay. You amazing, amazing house... I'm in a pickle here. It's Christmas Eve, and I want to give my grandma the one thing that she really wants, which to dream of Grandpop again. And Patsy needs help too. And this might be our last chance, because I think my grandmother is leaving us both. And, if I'm being honest, I want to see if I dream of Travis again. Okay! Okay. Can I see if Sarah wants to help us put the angel on top of the tree? Yeah. Seems only fair, since she picked out the tree. Sarah? In the kitchen! Sarah, do you want to help us with the angel on the... You made... kismet cookies? I did. Are those the true-love kinds? Yes. They are. I'm going to deliver one to a friend. I'll catch up with you later, okay? Half a pound of peppermint crunch. Thank you. Merry Christmas. Sarah! You look like someone who could use some more fudge. Merry Christmas. Oh, my... It looks exactly the way I remember it! Oh, honey! But how did you...? Well, Gramma Mia was right. We are meant to have that recipe. Oh. Oh! Sweet dreams, Miss Patsy. Oh! Thank you, honey. I might have a service issue in the square or something. If you squeeze that phone any tighter, it's gonna turn to dust. Well... I just don't know what's taking Benny so long. I feel like he really must hate it. Oh, yeah, that's the only possible explanation. Unless, of course, he's already here, and you just happen to randomly bump into him. Benny! What are you doing here? I have to meet family tomorrow, so I added a stop... because we need to talk. I read the manuscript. Okay. And it's... ...spectacular. I'm sorry. That was so mean. It is every bit as good as the first. Dare I say... better? Oh! Oh, oh. So sorry. Travis, Benny. Benny, Travis. Hi. Nice to finally meet you. You too. Benny, I cannot believe that you're here. Do you need to stay with us? No, I booked at the B&B. I have an early flight. I just wanted to see your face in real life when I told you. And I wanted to see... this town. And maybe finally meet Gramma Mia? Oh, okay, well, um... I think that could be arranged. Come, come, come. Come on. So, wait, did you actually bake kismet cookies? Yeah, I did. But I thought the recipe was... Don't even. I can't explain it. Well... did you save me one? Seriously? You want to try it? Jaded literary agents need love too, you know. Um... you know, I'm gonna go back to the B&B and make some calls. I'll text you later. - Okay. - Okay. Gramma Mia? Hey, darling. - Hey. - Hi. I found the recipe. I know. Hey! Where are the cookies? Oh, they're gone. I mean, you told Patsy, so Patsy told Raylene, and Raylene told... everyone... Yes, it was... it was like old times again for a few minutes. I mean, there was... there was a line out the door. I forgot how much I missed it. Well, we can do it next year, right? We can bake all day. You're selling the house, aren't you? That's why you're sorting everything. Yeah, I am. Are you okay? Please be okay. I really need you to be okay. Oh, my gosh, I am so okay! I... oh, I'm fine, darling. I-I-I'm fit as ever. I just... I just miss teaching. I miss... I miss helping children. So I've signed up for, um, for a program for seniors teaching English abroad. I just didn't know how to tell you. Okay. What about the house? Oh, it's... it's just too much for me now. But the kismet needs a Collins woman here. - Well... - I think. I suppose you're right, but... ...maybe this really is the end. I guess... Patsy will have our last kismet cookie. Except... I saved one for you... in case you wanted it. No. You keep it. I made it for you, 'cause I want you to dream of Grandpop again. Oh... ...are you sure? I'm sure. Thank you, darling. I love you. Did you know that she was planning to sell the house? Well, I suspected, but I didn't know she was gonna go teach. That's kind of excellent. Well, I know, but... What? What? What about the kismet? When I was little, I knew... I just knew... that it was all real... like, the cookies, and that we were special. But when I... You had the dream about me. Yeah, it all... pretty much crashed down. Mm-hmm. And I started thinking that it was just some fluff that my family told, and the whole town went along with it. But... now? Now, I don't know what to think. I mean, this town... and the cookies, and, I don't know, all the people, like... ...it feels like home again. Mm. Travis, I don't even want to tell you how long I spent struggling to write the second book. Like, struggling. But I come here and... wow! suddenly... there are ideas in here that I've written down for the next three Isabella books. Three! I don't want my grandmother to sell her house! I don't want some stranger living there. I don't want some stranger living there either. I want you living there. Me? Yeah. I bet Gramma Mia'd give you a great deal on the place. Oh, well... I'm leaving soon, so... My life's in New York. But, Sarah... ...what if... that cookie was right all those years ago? If I promise not to marry anyone tomorrow morning, would you stick around, and... and maybe we could find out? I-I... I cannot do this right now. I don't, um... good night, Travis. - Sarah? Sarah! - No. Good night. Hey! Sarah, wait! Sarah! So we're back to believing that kismet's real? Probably? I don't know. Maybe? Uh... But all the cookies are gone, so you can't prove your theory? Right. Is it too late to bake another batch? Well... 1:15 a.m. Merry Christmas. Well, seems like you have two choices. One, you come back to New York and make your agent very happy, you stay single, and maybe get writer's block again, and some stranger moves into Gramma Mia's house. Or two... you move here, to this cute town that inspires you, in a house that you seem to share DNA with, and the handsome guy you've loved since you were a kid, who clearly feels something too. It's a cripplingly difficult decision, I know. But, Benny... But, Sarah. What if none of it's real? Oh, but what if it all is? Ooh! Merry Christmas, darling Sarah! Merry Christmas! Gramma Mia... I have two questions for you. Okay. Did you dream of Grandpop? All night. Oh... - Then the recipe worked. - Yeah. Okay, second question, then. How many cookies did you give away last night? All of them. But how many? Um... seven or eight. Why? Well, I made 12. So one for you, one for Patsy... But that means that there were ten of them on the counter. Oh, no, there were definitely not that many. Why? Well, I just found one under my pillow... Oh! And if there were two of them missing, then... that means... Jazzy! Did you dream about Travis? Sarah! It worked! Oh, that's fantastic! Oh! Mia, have you come clean with your granddaughter yet? Oh, she has. Wait! You have, right? There's not more, is there? Because I can never tell with you. No, that's everything! I just wanted to come by and thank you. I'm so relieved. And happy! And excited! Oh, I want to see that necklace! Oh, I'll come by later. I promise! Merry Christmas! Okay, so... before we open presents, let's go next door and give Gramma Mia her gifts, all right? And then when we're over there, I'd like you to apologize to Sarah for putting that cookie under her pillow. Hey. Jazzy. You don't have to give me sad-face. I just want you to take responsibility, okay? Okay. Merry Christmas. Anybody home? Yes! In the kitchen. Merry Christmas, Gramma Mia. Oh! - Where's Sarah? - Jazzy. Oh, she's not here. What's that? Oh, that's the second Isabella book. First draft, hot off the presses. She used her real name. Yes, she did! And she left that for you. She left it? Mm. Yeah, before she went to the airport. The airport? Daddy, is she leaving because of something I did? Oh, no, no, no, sweetie. No. I think she left because of something I didn't do. Come on! - Daddy, we have to catch her. I know! Let's go! Wait! Wait, you don't underst-- Sarah, I'm so sorry about the cookie! Please don't leave! I'm not mad at you, Jazzy. It's okay. Gramma Mia said you were going to the airport, so I thought... Oh, I... I gave Benny a lift. He had an early flight. So you're not leaving? No. No, I thought I'd stick around. Do some more writing. Maybe buy Gramma Mia's house. Unless you got married while I was at the airport? No, ma'am, I did not. Jazzy? Come on. Why don't you and I go make some breakfast? But I already ate. Oh! Did she put a cookie under your pillow, too? Oh yeah! And did you dream about me? It doesn't matter. Look, I don't need a cookie to tell me that I'm in love with you. It doesn't matter what I dreamed. You totally dreamt about me, didn't you? All night long. Did you? You want to know what I remember about that infamous not-really-a-bear attack? Um... screaming? Running, locking the deadbolt? Before that! There was a split second where you didn't know it was a dog either. And you stepped in front of me. You remember that? Yeah. You stepped between me and the bear. That was the day I fell in love with you, Travis Walker... ...and it's been every day since. Of course I dreamt about you again. It's kismet. Merry Christmas, Sarah-Bear.
