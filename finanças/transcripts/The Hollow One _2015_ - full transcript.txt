Yeah? Hey, Mike, it's Jeff Nida from... Who? It's Jeff Nida... What? It's Jeff from Nida Investigation. Oh hey, Jeff, sorry, hey. Did you get the package? Yeah, yeah, the package. Yeah, yeah, I got it. You wanna keep digging? What? I mean keep looking. Oh, no, no, I don't think so. No, maybe, I don't know. She's already pissed off enough as it is. Yeah, well... I don't know what she expects. We've been married for 20 years and I have no idea where she came from, who her family is and how she even got here, and I got two daughters who want to know their heritage. What am I supposed to do, Jeff? I say we keep looking until you find what you need. Hello? I say we keep looking. Hello? Call me back when you get to... Ah, shit. Print that. Yeah, I will. Hey! I want you home early tonight. I gotta work tomorrow. Okay. And no drinking. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ow, Mom, you're pulling. Ooh. Sit still. All right, there you go. Ah, thanks. Finish up. Dad's outside. Oh, good, he's been gone all... Have you decided what you're going to wear tonight? Mmm. I was thinking, I don't know, boots and a dress? A long dress? Yeah, you know, like... This long? No, no, no, that won't work. Something a little more conservative. Okay, Mom. Okay, okay, all right. Well, have fun, okay? I love you. I love you. Be good. I will. Your dad's worried about you. You guys don't need to worry about anything. Hey, that's our job, we're parents. Yeah. Thinking about getting ready? That's what I'm doing. Hey, Beautiful. Hi. How was your day? It was good, how... Was yours? Hey, what are you doing? Dad, I'll be right down. Matt's waiting. Talk to your sister? Uh. Yeah, she's gonna drop me off at Beth's, so, yeah, we're covered. Cool. So you'll just give me a call tomorrow and, uh, we'll come pick you up when you're ready? Okay. Okay. What's that? It came. You got it? Jonesboro PD let it go. I had them send it out. Did Mom find out? Well, I had to forge a few things here and there. Really? Yep. Well, did you open it? What's in it? Was Mom in prison or something? I don't know. I don't think so. Let's go find out. All right, let's see what we got. I can't believe you found something. I know, it was just dumb luck. Whoa, what's this? I don't know. It's kind of heavy. They look like research notes of some kind. Huh. Here's the date, 1988. And a name on top, John Mallen. Maybe your grandparents were archeologists or something. John Mallen. These look like dig notes of some sort from a trip to an old Russian mine or something. Maybe they found some ancient, but high-tech artifacts? These look like springs. They do look like springs. "We've uncovered an astonishing collection "of metal artifacts dating between 20,000 to 300,000 BC." What kind of estimate is that? Look, I've carbon-dated this piece of metal and it's anywhere from five days to five trillion years old. It's a bunch of bull. Dad. You don't carbon date metal. Rachel. How long you been standing there? The point is I don't think there should be metal that's been machined that's even 20,000 years old. Yeah, I got that part. See how it twists? Look at this. Hey, Anna, we gotta go. No, wait, you gotta see this, it's crazy. Matt's waiting. Anna, I'm serious. You go ahead, I'll get this all organized and we'll go over it in the morning, okay? Don't tell Mom. You have to wait for me, promise me you'll wait. I promise. She's not gonna like that. Who asked you? Oh, okay. You know, we don't know everything about your mom, Rachel, and I think I have a right to know, okay? Okay. Sorry, Dad, please call me if you find anything. This is awesome. I will. You be safe. I will. I love you. I love you, too. No drinking. Yes, Sir. Mom's coming. Oh, shit. Hey. What are you up to? Oh, nothing. Oh, really? Really. Yeah, I was just going to, uh, change and get something to eat. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Well, I'm gonna go take a shower. Okay, take a shower? Yeah. By myself. By yourself. Yeah. All right. Cold chicken in the fridge waiting for you. Cold chicken? Mmm-hmm. Great. Shit. Hand 'em over. Hand what over? Hand what over? Yeah, I'm not sure I know what you're talking about. I think you know exactly what I'm talking about. I do? Mmm-hmm. Hey, that's not the keys. Gross! Come on. Got 'em. Gosh. Every time. Every time. Michael! Michael? Michael? Don't move. It made me put it on. I need you to give me what's in your hand. I just wanted to know who you were. Why did you run? There is no solace here. You can't have them. Her mind is free and full. I will break it and it will be mine. You okay, Sleepyhead? I don't feel so good. Are you gonna make it? You want me to pull over? Are you sure? 'Cause if you throw up on yourself, your dad's gonna kill me. And if you throw up on my car, I'm going to kill you. Aw, shit, Ray. Hey, are you okay? Come on, Ray. Hey, hey, hey. Out the window. Come on, out the window. Please, please, please, come on. Oh, God. Fuck, Rachel! Shit, shit, shit, shit. What happened? Rachel, we hit someone. Oh, God. Mom? Oh, my God, Mom! Rachel. God. Fuck, Rachel. Take it. What? It's yours now. Don't let him know you have it. Dad? Promise me. What are you doing out here? Promise. Mom... Mom. Mom? What have you done? Rachel, I... What have you done? Oh, fuck. Rachel, you are diseased. Rotting from within. I can save you. Hey, Sleepyhead. Hi. Hey. What time is it? It's pretty late. I was waiting for you. I know. You wanna go to bed? Mmm. Okay. I'll see you in the morning. Get some sleep, okay? Mmm-hmm. Mike! What the fuck? Mike, it's Jeff from Nida Investigations. Mike! Mike! Mike? Man, I've been calling you for months. I've got some stuff you gotta see. Mike. There's more, Mike. Much more than I thought there'd ever be. Mike, you gotta hear this. Mike? Oh, shit. Mike. Kill him. Holy fuck! Mike? Ow! Mike! It's not getting any better. No, not really. She still can't remember anything about that night, I wish she would just tell me what happened. Seriously, why won't you just tell me? No. Not after what Dad did to us. She won't talk to him. I don't know that she ever will. I don't know. We'll see. You know how she is. I don't... I don't know. Listen, I gotta go, okay? Bye. Who was that? Who called? So, where were you last night? Okay, so it's not someone from school or you would just tell me. You weren't at work because I called. And it can't be Dad because he doesn't call us. Ray... So who does that leave? You know who it was. Listen, he can't get a hold of his parents and he's worried. Hey. He got out, you know? Today. He got out this morning. What? He's on his way home. It's only been a couple of years. You know, I think we should go home. He got five years, it's only been a couple. You know, we've waited too long. We have to go back. Why didn't you tell me? You know, that night, Dad found something. It was this piece of metal, and it was really old and weird, and, you know, I think it has to be important. Did you call him or did he call you? Are you even listening to me? You should've told me, Anna. We have to go home. Let's go home. This time we'll stay until we get some answers, okay? And maybe it will help you remember, but we have to go back. I'm not going back there again. Well, I'm not giving up on Dad, not after everything we've been through. It's a three-hour drive. I don't care. I'll drive. I want to go home, Ray. This is our home now. Get used to it. Help me save her from the deep. Come home. You're not real, you're not real, you're not real. I'm waiting. Hey, Eaton. It's been a while. John. John, you okay? ♪ Help me, Lord, if I had my way ♪ A woman of your kind and kin? ♪ Samson, will you please your mother's mind? ♪ His truck's here. Anna. Hello? Dad? What the fuck? Well, he's not here, I'm gonna check outside. Enjoy the smell. Stan? Hey, Stan. It's Matt Hoffman. Stan, have you seen my parents? Stan, I can see you in there I just want to know if you've seen my mom and dad. Hey! Stan. Stan! (Ghostly Voices) Matt said that she was beat up and bloody before she was hit. Why was she beat up, Dad? Did you hit Mom? Did you hit her? Did you hit her? What did you do? What did you do to Mom? Why do you have that? Why do you have it? Give it to me! Do you think I want you here? Dad, what are you doing? Why are you doing this? We are not going anywhere. You think I want you here after what you did? Me? I didn't do anything. Matt did this. I didn't do anything. Get out of my house. No, Dad, please, please, please, please. I need you, I need you, I can't do this alone, Dad. Get out of my house! No, I won't. If you come back here, I will kill you. What? Get out of my fucking house! Hello? Dad? Ray! Anna. Hey, you. You know, I think you got something dead in there. Cats probably got a rat or something. Yeah, maybe. Hey. Hey, what were you doing in there anyway? I hate that place. Took a shortcut through the field. Hey, Ray, hold on a second. Rachel, come on, please. Just stop for a second. I need to talk to you. Don't touch me. Okay, I just need to find your dad, okay? Then I'll be gone. I won't ever come back if that's what you want, I promise. But Rachel, there's some seriously weird shit going on. Ray. Rachel? Your parents, are they okay? Did something happen? I don't know, honestly. They weren't there. The place was a mess. There were these weird like half-full milk cartons all over the place. Oh, yeah, we found a bunch in the kitchen, but they were just empty with the tops cut off. Really? Yeah. I... I don't know. We haven't found Dad yet though. His pickup's here, but I thought maybe he's in the field or the barn, or something. Okay, do you mind if I stay? I can maybe help you guys look. Yeah, of course, please. I'm so happy to see you. Yeah, me too. Rachel! Well, now we know where it's made. Dad's making it? It looks pretty fresh. What is he doing with this stuff? I don't know. I mean, it could be pig's food, but... Looks like he might have made this batch a couple days ago. So he's here? I don't know. You guys got power? I haven't seen any lights on. I don't think so. There wasn't anything on in the house. Okay, I think I'm gonna go check out the generator. It should've kicked on if the power turned off. Is that blood? There's enough gas for a couple of hours, but that's about it. We found some blood. That's not good. Jeez, your dad's been busy. Hey, look at the pictures. What is that? Looks kind of like a cigarette burn. Guys, it's on all of them. Oh, my God, is that a knife? Oh, shit. Oh, my God, Dad. Hey, hey, it's okay, I'm sure he's fine. No, no, we have to find him. What if he's hurt? What... There's no one here to help him. He's all alone. I know. We'll find him, okay? We should probably call 911. Yeah, I'll do it. Okay, call the clinic, too, just in case. Okay. Rachel, I don't think you guys should stay here tonight. It's not safe. I'm not going anywhere. Let's just head back to the city. You know, we can come back tomorrow once we've gotten some help. I'm staying here, I need some answers. Well, at least let me help you. You've done enough. Matt. Matt, come on. Matt, stop it. Hey. Matt? Hey, Ray. Dad? Rachel. Help. Hey, Rachel, hang on. Rachel, will you talk to me? Please? Do you ever ask yourself why you can't remember? What? That night, don't you wonder why you can't remember what happened? This is not about that. Yes, it's all about that. No, it's not, it's about you and your problems and all the bullshit around what you think happened that night. Everything that followed is on you, so just stop. That's not true, okay? And you know it. I paid the price. We all paid the price for it, you selfish prick. You destroyed everything. You don't fix that. You don't take it back. I know it wasn't your fault. Okay? It was an accident. Just get away from me. Ray, no one could have stopped in time. No one. You left me alone with nothing. I would never leave you. Babe, never. You know why I had to go away. You know. It's not a big mystery that needs to be solved. You already know. Just... Just leave me alone please. Ray, hey, Ray. Look, we all suffer, all right? Some more than others, but how you're feeling right now, it's only temporary. Okay? As soon as you realize that, everything will be okay, because there's people that love you and will do anything for you, then you can start to move on and live your life. It was an accident, Ray. Please stop. Don't do this. Ray. Ray. Fuck off. Hey, the phone's dead. Okay, um... I think I'm gonna try to go out and get a signal. Okay, do you want me to go with you? No. No, no. Stay here and keep an eye on Rachel, and look out for your dad. Okay. Do you mind if I take the car? Yeah sure, the keys are in it. Okay, great. Oh, hey. Yeah? You know that metal thing that you talked about on the phone? I think Rachel has it. What? Yeah, she's got that and some other stuff. Really? I think so, but I don't know for sure. Be safe. Okay. Be back in a few. Yeah. (Whispering) (Whispering) Ray, are you okay? Hey, what's wrong? Hey. You okay? I don't know. I don't know what's real and not real. I don't know what happened. I don't know why I feel the way I feel. I don't know what's wrong with me. I know. I know, I know. I mean, it feels real. Everything feels real. You, this place, being here. I just... There... There are things that I... Hey, you didn't do anything wrong. I didn't? Then why do I feel like this? He still loves you, you know. I know. I'll be fine. I just... I need some sleep. Okay, then stay here. Sleep. I'll keep looking around till the police come. Okay. Okay. I'm right downstairs, okay? Okay. Can I take that? Yeah, of course.

Are you really here? Yeah, Daddy, it's me. Your mother, her father... He found something deep within the Earth. Buried far from sight. It's older than life. It's older than this world. When it woke up, your mother tried to stop it, but... But how can you stop what's beyond understanding? How can you know what to do? What it wants? What it is? Your mother tried but it killed everyone she ever loved, so she ran and hid. But I brought it back here. I brought it back. Oh, God, the things it made me do. Feed it, to care for it. It wants you now, Ray, and I don't know why. But it's killing me to get to you and I can't stop it. I've got nothing left. I just wanted to know who she was. It's here. Run. You must remember your sins so you can be free. I can't find it. We should just take him upstairs and wait for Matt. Ray, come on, help me. Help me, come on. What have you done? Rachel. Oh, my God. Hey. Ray, you okay? It's gonna be okay. Oh, my God, Ray. Hey, Ray, come on, you gotta see this. I saw this in the notes. Hey, I'll be right back, okay? There is still time for atonement.

Come on. You don't need these. What's wrong? I remember everything. Oh, Babe. I was driving. It's okay, Rachel. I'm here. Everything's going to be okay. Dad? You didn't tell me. Why didn't you tell me? I'm sorry. I tried. I didn't know how. I tried. I tried. I didn't know how. I'm so sorry. Why did you do it? Because I love you, Rachel. I love you. I think my mom changed her name. What? I think her whole family was murdered. How do you know that? Oh, shit. We're gonna lose it. Lose what? The power. Come. Don't be afraid. Rachel, hey. Rachel, where you going? Rachel. Hey. Come on, Rachel, follow me. Oh, Dad. No, no, no, Anna. Wait, stop. There's something wrong with them. So? We can help him. Daddy. Stop! Stop! Stop, Michael!

Anna, I'm really sorry, but we can't stay here, okay? Come on, we gotta go find your sister, come on. Come on. Rachel! Anna? She's headed for the barn, come on. What are you doing? There are these symbols on the device and it looks like they line up and it has to mean something. Anna, we don't have time for this, come on. I think it fits in this thing. Anna, we don't even know what this thing is, okay? It could be a whistle or a fucking bomb. No, this is important. Then let's bring it with us, but Rachel needs our help. Come on, come on, come on. He's waiting for you. Okay, you gotta listen to me. If I'm not back in five minutes, you leave. Do you understand me? You go and you get help and you bring it back. No, I wanna come with you. Anna, I'm not in the best shape, okay? I can't take care of you and your sister. I can take care of myself. I know you can, but somebody's gotta bring back help, okay? You can do this. Wait here. Anna, lock the door, lock it. Oh, my... Oh, my God. Oh, God. God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Shit. Oh, God! Oh! Oh... Fuck. You are what he desires. Rachel? Flesh and bone. Ready to serve and be loved. I am hollow and empty. You will fill me, so I can become like you. Rachel! Rachel? Rachel! Rachel. Rachel, Rachel. What are you doing? Come on. We gotta go right now. It wants me to help it. I don't care what it wants, Rachel. Anna and I need your help. Come on. Hey. Do not fear me, Rachel. Your fate lies beyond them. You will show me what your God would not, so I may understand my existence. What are you? Let go of them, Rachel. Commune with me. You stay the fuck away from her! Rachel. Rachel. What? Put it on your neck. Rachel, hey. What? Rachel, Rachel, no, look at me. Look at me. Hey, I don't know what you're hearing or what you're seeing, but it's not real, okay? It's a lie. Look at me. It's me. It's Matt. I'm real. Focus on me, I'm right here. Please remember, Rachel, I need you to come back, please. Please, I need you to come back. Matt? Yeah. What am I doing here? I don't know, Babe, you just came out here. Look, hey, I need you to look at this. Do you know what this is? Come on, Babe, think. It fits on the top, that's what she said. Fits on the top... Okay. So, what's this supposed to do? Matt. All right. Behind you. Matt? Ray? Anna! No, I need the medallion. Dad? Daddy, stop! Dad, let go of him! Stop it! Just stop it! Daddy? Daddy! No! Anna. Take this. Anna. Hey, Anna. You're okay, Anna. Everything's gonna be fine. You need to take this, Anna. Okay, here. This too. If you will not help me, then all will suffer. Matt! Shit. Hey! Is this what you want? Rachel, no! To control what you can't have, you fucking coward! You cannot have them, but you can have me. Don't! (Indistinct Voices) Finally, we are one, you and I. You will see what you want to see. What is a light that radiates fear, anger, love? Guiding every soul to death. Why did he destroy us? We only came to see him, to worship him. You will show me what he sees in you like your mother would not. So I may become what he desires. So I may become... Like... God! Keep going, Anna. Come on. Keep going, make it work. No! What just happened? I think I did it. Did what? What did you do? I... I don't know. I... I just did what was in the notes. What did that do? Where did it go? I don't know, but it's gone, isn't it? Ray, did you put that on your neck? Did you put it there? Why did you do that? Ray... Rachel, what did you do? Why would you do that? I don't know. I just did it. Oh, my God. Are you okay? We're gonna find a way to take it off, okay? Don't worry. Yeah, there's so much stuff in those research notes. I'll read through it all. I'll find something. Okay, can I see that? We have to get rid of it. We have to hide it somewhere where nobody can find it. I'm staying here. You can't. That thing is controlling people. I've got to do something, I can't just leave them like this. What if it comes back? It comes back. No. Be careful. Sorry. Sorry, are you okay? I'm fine. I'm more worried about you. You don't have anything to worry about. I love you. I love you, too. You girls have to go. The gas can in the car should be enough to get you far enough away. Okay. Hey, be careful, okay? I'm not sure that's gonna help. You guys call for help as soon as humanly possible, okay? I mean, as soon as possible. Yeah. Good luck. Ray? Don't let anyone take that thing off your neck. Wh... Why? I took it off Eaton. I think it killed him. So until we know anything more, just don't touch it, okay? Okay. See you soon. Take care of each other. The notes. I left them in the house. I should... I should get those. Hey, you okay? Yeah. (Whispering) Get back! Get back! No! You're mine. Now, see what we have done.
