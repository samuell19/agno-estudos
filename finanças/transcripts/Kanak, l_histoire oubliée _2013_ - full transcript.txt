FRANCE ? WORLD CUP 1998 I think it's a bit of a shame, bringing foreign players in as "the French team?. I notice that players in other teams sing their national anthems loudly and with pride. But most of the players in the French team either don't sing it or don't know it. KANAK THE FORGOTTEN HISTORY NEW CALEDONIA 1988 Hi, Gerald. OK, Marc? Are you here to see Max? No, I'm here to see Karembeu. Christian? You want him? Not bad, not bad. - Who? Me? - But you're wasting energy. - You need to channel it. - Who are you? - Hello. - Hi, Max. Come to sing the papers. OK. - Can we talk? - Sure. You've got quite a reputation. What position do you play? Any. I just like playing. I noticed. That's the problem. You're all over the place. You're a sweeper. Not a winger. Max is going for a trial at FC Nantes. Do you want to go? You're as good, if not better. I just play for fun. Just think about it. We've got another 3 months. If we start now, I can train you up. I'm not sure my parents will agree. Study's the priority at the moment. Your dad asked me to come to see you. It's noon on RFO Nouméa. Coming up: news, with Baptiste Zimako. Uncle Edmund, it's me! Samy! OK? Cousin! How are you? What are you doing in Nouméa? I'm going to provide backup. I'm taking a boat with your dad. Samy, time to go. OK, son? Marc Kanyan? What did he say? He wants me to try out for FC Nantes. That's great. You're great-grandfather went to France in 1931. Yes, but Mum will never agree. Since the others went, she needs me. I'll talk to her. Start training with Kanyan. Get yourself in top shape. But keep it between us. Be careful in Ouvea. It's dangerous. Don't worry. I'll call Kanyan and tell him to go ahead. If you're going in 3 months, we need to work fast. She's checking you out. Shut up! What are you waiting for? Get in there! I'm in no rush. Let's take the Algerian example. You can win militarily, but lose politically. Victory lead to a dead end. - Sorry, can we say something? - OK. Though I'd rather you'd knocked. The demo tomorrow is 2pm at the Cocotiers. It's really important, with the presidential elections coming up. We have to make our voices heard. We need you there. Tjibaou and the FLNKS will be there. Independence for Kanaky! Easy, Nicolas. Thanks. I don't think there'll be a free Kanaky any time soon. France won't give up New Caledonia. Not just for the nickel. Imagine if they gave you independence. They couldn't stay in Corsica or the Antilles. Neither the left or the right want it. So we've got no chance. I'm trying to help you understand your island. Quiet, please. I don't suppose you're coming. I am. Why? Wow! The big chief's son at his ﬁrst demo! Just don't tell your dad! My dad's for independence. But through education, not violence. Yeah ? all talk. Go, go, go. 4 min 13 a kilometre. That's good progress. Can I go? The whole school's there. We're not done. No ball today. Come on. And get some shoes and get used to them. You won't be on the beach in Nantes. It's heating up. It's a peaceful march. The cops are just showing out. Christian, from now on, football's what counts. Here. This came from Nantes. Departure: 30 June. Return: open. - Anything about Max? - He didn't make it. He's going to try Quimper. Did you do your permit? It just needs a photo and signature. It's a shame about Max. That's why you need to train and be the best. And get that permit posted. OK. Sprints, now. Get ready. Manoa. Are you bleeding? What happened? It was the cops. They wanted us to go, but we wouldn't, so... They charged us. - Where were you? - With my uncle. He's always your excuse. They hit the Ouvéa police station. Delphine Chenin has the details. No news of the 27 officers taken this morning at Fayaoué station. Fayaoué is Samy‘s unit. Independence activists moved in at 7am, surprising territorials and 30 other officers in the area. 3 ofﬁcers were killed and 5 people were injured. - Who's Samy? - His cousin. He's a police officer. He loves him. He saved his life when they were kids. - So? - No answer. Damn. I hope he's OK. It's Laﬂeur‘s guys! Come and get some! They don't need a classroom! Wait, wait. Are they off? They didn't talk to us. They've got enough to work with. They don't care! Maybe they knew. Aren't they staying? They're checking the area. - My arse! - Mr Peyrac! Don't worry. We'll stay with you tonight. We still need to get organized. Get what you can. Ladies ? lock yourselves in your dormitory. When will it stop? The hostage-taking was just the start. See? Violence makes it worse. ls it better to take a beating and just do nothing? It's kicking off. It's time to pick a side. My parents are here. Do you want a lift? I can't get through to mine. I'm going to Canala. Are you going to stay long? No. I don't know. I've got stuff to do. - Call me, if you come back. - Sure. Let's go. Overseas Minister Bernard Pons condemned today's killing of police ofﬁcers with machetes. Only one ofﬁcer was killed with a machete. - The others were shot. - How do you know? Why would they lie? Listen to Radio Kanaky and you'd know a bit more. I told you, the soldiers couldn't get through. - Kanaky! - Kanaky! Let's go! I'm worried about Samy too! The blockades won't hold. The soldiers will get through. They'll get a nice welcome. See you, then. Goodbye, sir. Hello, Abel. Peace be upon you. Revise the imperfective subjunctive. Dictation on Monday, kids. What are you doing back here? School's closed. - I tried to call. - What about training? Mr Kanyan said I could come back, for Samy. Any news? Coming back was dangerous. Thanks, Abel. - Hello? - Didn't they give the names of the dead officers? Samy was in the barracks. - He's OK, but... - What? - Come on! - Christian! He'd only just got there. He didn't know anyone. What are they going to do now? Calm down. They won't hurt a big chief's son. Does Mum know? I'm waiting to tell her. It's good to see you, son. - Did you hear about Samy? - That's why I came. I'll give you a shopping list. Hi, Granddad. Hi, Lali. How much does she want? Four . Karembeu. - There you go. - Thanks. Hang on. I need to go out. I'll give you a lift. It's 4pm. Baptiste Zimako has the news. The Ouvéa hostages have been split up. Efforts to locate them have proved unsuccessful. Tension in Grande Terre is high as soldiers try to take Canala from the rebels. 160 officers, including 20 from special operations... Come on. Cana|a‘s not important. The hostages aren't there. Since Machoro died, they're worried about escalation. Congratulations. Your dad told me that your football is taking you to France. I'm really haPPY- It's not my main concern, right now. What's France like? No idea. I was born here. And I'll be dead before I can go. What's this plane ticket for Christian? You went behind my back. I meant to say. He's not going to France! His future might be there. Right! How many years did you play without earning a penny? Football isn't a job. France is different. The players make good money there. - Look at Antoine Kombouaré. - He's not my son! Lali needs to study. Football almost cost him a year. I want him to succeed. He can graduate in France. - I care, too. - He'll graduate here, then we'll see. The bigtime is waiting for you over there. The army's not far off. They'll crush the rebels. I heard shots. They want this over before the election. - Go to bed. - What if the army gets to Canala? That's enough. Go in. Start the generator. The power's off. - And the phone. - Shit. - So? - We got through ﬁne. It's busy, but no trouble. The booths are shut. Auntie Mailou wants Christian to help in the restaurant. - ls she opening? - Apart from a bit of graffiti, it's fine. - Can I go? OK. But don't hang about. Curfew at 9pm. Hey, Christian! Remember Dom, Gaby and Pierrot? Of course I do. What's up? I'm going home before the curfew. Bye. I'll come too. We'll go by Guéwé's. There are soldiers that way. I don't care. It's our land. Guéwé‘s only just died. Vultures! The land belongs to us, not the whites. What do you care? What? I know what you and Kanyan are planning about France. I thought we had no secrets! You're no brother. - I just want to try out. - Right! France treats us like shit. If I get to be pro, I'll speak for us. - Like your granddad in 1931? What's your problem? You don't know how it was for those guys. Let's hear it, if you know so much. I heard they got shown in zoos, like animals. No way! Why would the chiefs lie? That's just independence propaganda. The French have always treated Kanaks as sub-human, uncivilized savages. I've got proof. Hands behind your head. You heard me. Why are you out? - Why? - We just ﬁnished work. We're going home. What are you up to? You know there's a curfew. We had to work a bit longer than we expected. They're clean. Get out of here, before I change my mind. What more do you need? Those aren't our huts. That's chief Calé. He was part of the troupe in 1931. There's no date on it. I have to go. See you tomorrow. Right. Bye, champ. Téé Kanaké, the ﬁrst man, went into the sacred tree. He followed the roots into the underworld, to the land of the dead. Deep down in mother earth, he turned into a snake. Since then, the roots of the sacred tree have grown upwards, to enable Téé Kanaké, the bearer of universal knowledge, to inspire and watch over the Kanak people. Time for bed, children. - One more story! - Time for bed! Do you have granddad's pictures? That was the yam festival, in 1929, when your great-grandfather joined our clan with the Nondo clan, by marrying off his oldest daughter. It lasted a week. And the Colonial Exhibition in Paris? They were welcomed like kings. And the others? What others? I remember another one of granddad and some others. They were sitting in front of a sort of hut. I only had one photo from France. This one. Now go. I'm tired. The ﬁrst round of the elections has concluded. Frangois Mitterrand has 34.11% of the vote against Jacques Chirac‘s 19.96%. Raymond Barre has 16.54% and Jean-Marie Le Pen has broken through at 14%. Mitterrand got 34%. Good. The right will hit hard in the 2nd round. There are people from the FLNKS to talk to you. - With news from Ouvéa? - No. - Why did they come? - Christian! It's men's stuff. They want to take Canala from the authorities. They want all the Kanaks with them. That's crazy. Don't take part in the demonstration this afternoon. I know that many of you are angry and worried. Please be patient. Violence has never helped our people. This morning's result is encouraging. If the left wins, there'll be dialogue. So stay at home with your children. Independence for Kanaky! Independence for Kanaky! Get involved! - It's kicking off! - Bring it on! Move! They've got tanks! See where non-violence gets you? My arse. Not now, Nicolas. She's dead, for fuck's sake. Come on! There's news from Ouvéa. - They've released a hostage group. - Samy‘s? No. In the south. The army has encircled Gossanah village. The men have been separated and tortured to reveal the 2nd group's whereabouts. The Kanak people will respond to this torture by putting up more blockades. We warn the French government... Let's go. We need to move. - What are you doing? - This means war. Shit. Your dad. The radio said the hostages were free. - Including Samy? - No. We've been looking for you. Auntie Mailou saw you at the demo. Are you crazy? - They shot a girl. - I know. It's awful. It's never been so violent. Come on. Sorry. I don't want you hanging around with Nicolas. Marcellin will take you back to Nouméa, to train. What about Mum? I'll talk her round. - I hope it'll all be OK. - Me too. Kanak Cannibal "Cannibal? We interrupt with a news ﬂash. This is the long way. There's no blockade. - Baptiste Zimako. - The latest from Ouvéa: according to sources, the army has located the hostages in a cave in Gossanah. An encirclement is underway. If this is... What about Samy! I'd have told you, if we knew. Focus on your training. - What's the plan? - The usual. Sprints and long distance on the beach. Strengthen your body and mind. You'll need to be strong, in France. Why? You said the Kanaks get a king's welcome. - What's up with you? - Nothing. We don't know much about the 1931 trip. Did they stay in a hotel? Granddad never said. How did the French react to them? There weren't many blacks in France. Who knows? And who cares? Just forget about it? Come here. Let's have a break. You need it. This can't go on, Christian. I like this place, too. And defend it? my way. Fight for your identity. But you need to play. - Right? - I think so. When someone goes to France, our reputation is at stake. I know it's an honour. I'm sorry about your cousin Samy. But when you get out on the pitch, leave your problems behind. If you can't, you may as well stop now. I can. Good. Then prove it to me. Do you know her? She's a classmate. She's too early. You've got an hour of ﬁrst touch to do. What do you know about the Colonial Exhibition? Our ancestors went to show our traditions and dances. They went up the Eiffel Tower. - Do you believe that? - Why do you mention it? Let me show you something, but keep it a secret. I promise. I found this in my granddad's stuff. - Postcards. - Look closely. "Cannibal." That's my great-granddad Willy. Why does it say "canniba|?? I'd like to know. Where are you going? Peyrac‘s a history teacher. - Where did you get these? - At my granddad's. It can't be the Colonial Exhibition. Look how they're dressed. The huts aren't like ours. They're like African huts. And the clothes aren't right. What happened at the exhibition? You're a history teacher. You must know. If you do, then tell me. It's my history ? my granddad's history. Nicolas says they were shown in a zoo. I have a right to know. I only know what you do. What we're told. Kanak history is hard to establish. Everything's handed down orally. I've never seen any other photos. OK. Let's go. Wait, Christian. I'll try to ﬁnd out. But I'll need the photos, so I can make some photocopies. Thanks. I have to get back. Forget about it. I'm sure you're imagining things. The ﬁrst time isn't easy. What? Your friends told me. I think it's cute. Stop it. - Don't you like me? - I do! - What are you scared of? - Nothing. - OK, I get it. - Manoa... Don't take it like that. I'm going to France. Maybe for a while. I don't want you to get hurt. Or me. You're not gone yet. I am, in my head. - And I don't know for how long. - I'll wait. I may not come back. Then I'll come. Come on. We're only 17. Manoa... 6 officers and a Melanesian colleague and a magistrate went to negotiate the rebels' surrender. But they were surprised. Captain Legorjus, from the GIGN mission, tried to negotiate. The cave cannot be taken while the rebels' supplies hold out. The Defence Minister suggests contact could be made via the captain's radio. Negotiation may be possible and reinforcements are being sent. Tension remains high in Grande Terre. 20 Melanesians were arrested in Nouméa. Canala remains the most heavily affected area. While the government in Paris... You'd be better off complaining to your own people! Everyone out. Line up. Quiet! Line up! Papers! He's injured! Stop him! Sorry, no entry. Really? I know him. He's with me. - What's up? - The road's blocked 3km on. I'll lose all my merchandise. We'll take another way. They won't let me through. You'll be ﬁne, with me. There's been trouble between our two communities, but I'm afraid this is serious. Lots of Kanaks want us out. There's a difference between whites like you, who've always lived here and respected us, and the arrogant whites that want our land and think we're stupid. Unfortunately, not many make the distinction. Relax. We're almost there. We'll go along the east coast. And you'll have to take care of me! Oh, shit! - Where are you going? - Canala. Canala? Who's he? My assistant. - What's his name? - Karembeu. Karembeu? Are you related to the mayor of Canala? He's my uncle. Fucking trouble-maker. Get out. Take it easy. This guy is like my own son. - What's that? Are you on the Kanak side? I'm not political. Well you should be. That vermin - bunch of layabouts. We've taken them from the stone age to the atomic age. I've got business. Can we go? You can. But not him. Get out! OK? Thanks. I hope this won't be a problem. Don't worry. Those guys are all mouth. Relax. Have a nice weekend. Dad will be angry, but I couldn't stay in Nouméa. He's in Houaﬂou, with Marcellin. I'm sick of both of you. I can't deal with everything. Sorry, Mum. - Any news about Samy? - Just what's on the radio. - ls that washing? - Yes. Let's have it. I'll put it on. - Are there any stamps? - In the box on the desk. We don't want you here. What's got into you? Your dad was lecturing my parents. I'm a bad inﬂuence on you. I'm big enough to make my own decisions. I don't want trouble. Get out of here! Free Kanaky! Dom, Gaby and Pierrot come to Nino‘s. Don't let anyone past. Coming? - Who's Nino? - A freedom ﬁghter. Hi, brother. - Who's this? - Christian. One of ours. Over to you. We'll show them who makes the laws. - Yes. - Down to the river! What are they doing? Where are they going? Stop with your questions. They're coming! Kanaky! Fall back! Take cover! Get back in the van! Let's go! - To victory! - Yes! They won't be back on the road any time soon. - Nice one! - He's a good leader. You could have warned me. What for? It wouldn't have mattered. You'd have gone. I like to know what I'm getting involved in. Here. It's good stuff. It'll relax you. Forget it. He's "no drugs, no alcohol, no sex?. Take it easy. I was only kidding. You're cool, but you're a bit uptight. Less go and catch some shrimp. Shit. - Why aren't you in Nouméa? - I'm not a kid! Do you think Nino will make you a man? You're lucky Dad's in Houaﬂou. What are you thinking? He's no good. All that's just a cover for his hatred of white people. What's in it for you? You should do right by Dad. Dad, Dad, Dad! I want to be me! You want to be like him so much. What? You're old. You gave up on being a sailor to teach, like him. How can you stand by, with everything that's happening? It's been hard for you. I'm not going to say anything, but you should get in line! Lali, breakfast's ready. I'm not hungry. A problem here means a problem here. Uncle Kain is in Ouvéa. Don't tell Dad that I told you. Samy‘s OK. He's negotiating with the rebels now. It'll sort itself out. I'll get it. Hello? Mr Peyrac? OK. Thanks a lot. Who was it? Kanyan. He wants me to go to Nouméa. Good. I'll take you to the coach. France didn't bring the Kanaks over. The Colonial Federation arranged it with the governor of the island. I found this in the archives. "Rental contract"? Like slaves? Your ancestors got had. The contract was completely disrespected. They weren't show at Vincennes with the others. People paid to see them in huts, at the zoo in the public gardens. And they pretended to be cannibals, rather than dancing? is that the inscription you dreamed of? "Kanniba|en". Does that mean "cannibalT? Yes ? in German. What were they doing in Germany? The Federation needed money. They sent them to Hamburg zoo to replace the crocodiles. How could they let themselves be humiliated? They were trapped. They could have rebelled. And my dad and granddad knew... How could they have lied? They must have had reasons. Your culture is based on forgiveness. - No one's asked for it. - It'll come, in time. France is starting to acknowledge its mistakes, the slavery and colonization, the Algerian war. It needs to acknowledge things here, too. Or the violence will go on. Lali! There's news from Ouvéa. They went in at 6am. 19 rebels were killed. - How's Samy? - He's ﬁne. The hostages are safe. Where is he? They were all sent here, to the naval base. Uncle Kain is coming. The families can see them. Can't they come home? I think they're being kept off-camera, at least until the elections are over. Follow me. - Not you. - He's my cousin. Parents only. That's the order. What's happening? Samy‘s going to Wallis-et-Futuna. - When? - This evening. Why there? Let's go. Christian wasn't allowed in. Even his mother wasn't allowed to hug him. I've never seen him like that. He was crying and saying it was his fault they were killed. I think he convinced them to give in, but they still attacked. Rumours are going round that the soldiers used grenades and ﬂamethrowers. The leader and two of his guys were brought out injured but alive. And then executed! They killed 2 officers. They wanted revenge. ls that why the witnesses are at Wallis-et-Futuna? Including Samy. For them, Samy‘s a Kanak, more than a policeman. Lali, I'm taking your aunt and uncle to the airport. I'll drop you at the training ground. Mitterrand has been re-elected, with 54% of the vote. Chirac‘s had it. Let's hope Rocard becomes Prime Minister. The right really messed up. 19 people dead. But I heard that the soldiers are going to be let off. - And the hostage takers. - Yes. The ones that survived. - I made some food. - I'm not hungry. You haven't eaten in 2 days. - I said I'm not hungry! - Lali! Go and get him. I'm happy for you to go to France. 3o? Aren't you happy? Yes, yes. What are you doing? We came from Lifou, for my sister's birthday. - Have a drink with us. - Thanks. - To Lifou! - To Lifou! Bye! Did you sleep out? - Where were you? - On the beach. - And the curfew? - No one saw us. nus"? We need to talk. Do you know who called? Kanyan. You haven't been training. You didn't send your permit. What's going on? I can't keep covering for you. - Where's you permit? - I'm not going. What? I'm not going to that shitty country. That's your country. After all that trouble with Mum, you're not going? - Why are the big chiefs here? Checking in, after the crisis. After? And the dead freedom ﬁghters don't count? - That's a rumour. That's why Samy‘s in Wallis-et-Futuna. How do you know that? Don't talk about it. It could spark something of. The big chiefs don't want that. They're starting. I haven't ﬁnished. Stay here. Samy‘s in Wallis-et-Futuna, because he saw the killings. They're a bunch of murderers. The chiefs don't want it mentioned yet. - Why not? - The colonial exhibition. In 1931 our people were shown like zoo animals, forced to play cannibals. The chiefs made up a story to stop us rebelling against France. See? - You wouldn't believe me. - Like cannibals! Now they're taking our land and nickel and testing their bombs. If your dad and his people won't get rid of the whites, we will. Right now. Go ahead. - They're Kassard‘s. - Who cares? Go on! Shoot! Shoot! Give it! We'll do all these fucking farmers. Kassard‘s a good guy! They're all bastards! That's enough! I don't want to ﬁght you! Your dad and your whole family are cowards. Stop. Stop! GO. Or I'll kill you. Thanks. I'll be back. Thanks a lot. - You chose right. - I hope so. Christian's gone. I found this. He's stopped training. He doesn't want to go. Why didn't you tell me? I was dealing with it. Hi, Lali. - You have to go. - My mind's made up. We're all upset by what's happened. Take a step back. Don't waste your talent. The big chiefs are still under the white man's thumb. Marcellin told me everything. Are the freedom ﬁghters right? ls violence the only way to independence? You have to ﬁght! Like in Ouvéa? Under colonialism, the revolts were cruelly put down. Our people were decimated. If we hadn't been pacifists, there'd be no one left. Better dead than slaves! I'm sorry they've got to you. No one's got to me. I'm not a kid anymore. I know about 1931. How could a big chief accept to humiliate himself like that? And then it was all hushed up, like you're trying to hush up Ouvéa. You don't know so much. Hello, Ate. Hello, Paul. Hello, Lali. I hear you've got questions about our trip to France. Come here.. I'll leave you. I was your age in 1931 and I was happy to go to France. Aren't you going to France? Leave your brother alone. Did you change his mind? Give him time. Yes, I know, Marc. I don't know if he'll change his mind. He won't talk about it. Yes, OK. Thanks. Mr Kassard! |‘m sorry. I couldn't stop them. It wasn't against you. We know you're with us. Don't be sorry. I told you it was impossible. Are you going? I'm not Kanak. I'm not really white. I'm not really French. We're going to try our luck on the Marquesas Islands. What about you? You only live once, Christian. Do what's right. For you. Jean-Marie Tjibaou makes history, shaking Jacques Laﬂeur‘s hand. It's 26 June 1988. The FLNKS and the RPCR have signed an agreement under the aegis of Prime Minister Michel Rocard. The territorial status is ﬁxed for the next 10 years. This came, from Samy. I'm ﬁne. Good luck, champ. See you soon, Samy Maybe it'll change his mind. Wallis The army's assault on the hostage takers resulted in... Joaquim, sit up straight. Sit up straight. Dad. Granddad. My family. Thanks for believing in me. And for everything you've done for me. Mum, thanks for letting me go. I know what it means to you, that I'm taking the Karembeu name to France. I hope I'm worthy of the honour and of the values you've taught me. Thanks, Christian. Granddad, Mum, children, Christian is leaving. We have to let him. Christian, go with a glad heart. You really scared me! Was that your Maradona act? Come and sit down. I'll get the food. It was a great honour for me. I owe it all to you. - I'd like to apologize... - Forget it. But do a good trial. My reputation's at stake! I'll do my best. Will passengers on ﬂight 728 to Paris make their way to the boarding gate. - Where's Marcellin? - He's buying something. Passengers on the UTA ﬂight to Paris are invited to board now. Be careful in Paris. It's dangerous. There are attacks. Eat well. Sleep well. Don't ﬁght. Listen to your teachers. OK, Mum. You going to see wonderful things. The Mona Lisa, Les lnvalides, the Eiffel Tower. - I'm going to Nantes! - That's nice too. - And... - I know. No alcohol, no smoking and no women till I'm older. And no politics. Thanks. Goon Have a good trip, Lali. Don't leave without these. They didn't have any wrapping paper. - That's a month's salary! - Dad helped with it. I know we've had our problems recently, but I'm proud of you. Have a good trip.
