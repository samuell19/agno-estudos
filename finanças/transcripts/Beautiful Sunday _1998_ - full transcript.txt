Su-yeon! Why did you find me again? Su-yeon, what are you talking about? I thought it couldn't be. Why are you doing this to me? It's not you, right? Why can't you speak? Tell me it's not you! Do you know what I had to go through since that day? Did you know I had to give up everything because of you? I was about to get married! Tell me! Tell me! You bastard! Please calm down and listen to me. Calm down? I'll explain everything. I must have been out of my mind. I didn't know what I was doing. I must have gone crazy. But Su-yeon! I love you. That is still true. How can you do that? Is that love? Then what am I? You are not even human, you crazy fuck! Su-yeon, Su-yeon... Su-yeon! Su-yeon! Su-yeon! Su-yeon! Su-yeon, Su-yeon... Su-yeon, Su-yeon... He's asking for the money and the stuff. So are you asking me... ...to cough it up? Det. Kang. I don't even know what's going to happen to me. Wake up! Do you think he will stop here? There is no other way! No other way? Stupid fuck. Do you want a piece of advice? If you don't want to get hurt, Cut the bullshit and take care of him first! Sang-tae was released sometime ago. There is an information that he's doing the business again. It seems like he's involved... with Hyun-suk's murder. Do you have any info? According to the D.A.'s report, ...the amount of drug confiscated with Sang-tae's arrest... ...was 2kg, not 200g. And the rest has disappeared. Are you saying Hyun-suk snatched it in the middle? There is a possibility. Then there must be a snitch in the middle. It could be Hyun-suk or... Wasn't Det. Kang in charge of Sang-tae's arrest? Don't jump to conclusions! I know you all are very tired. But stay alert and... ...locate Sang-tae's men first. And search all the bars and clubs. Damn, why did he have to make trouble? Isn't it enough to get a medal and the stuff? What more does he want? Det. Lee! Did you see it? What? Did I say something wrong? Don't insult Det. Kang because he isn't here. What? How dare you... Why? Did you get a share? What are you doing? No cases are being solved lately... You two are not from the same town, or from the same school... but what we hear is that... you and Ki-chul are very close. I have nothing more to say. We heard your wife has been hospitalized for a long time now... Paying the bill must be tough. Don't you have better thing to do? Take it. Hello. It's me, Sang-tae. Let's meet. Meet me at 10 o'clock at the freezer plant. - Don't do anything stupid. - I got it. You went to see Ki-chul a few days ago, right? I had some questions to ask for the investigation. Okay then. Everybody has something to hide. Just don't do anything suspicious. My, my. The great detective is sweating and shivering... Do you know what this is? Hyun-suk ratted everything about how you two did it. I may turn this in, if you don't play along. If you turn that in, do you think you'll be safe? Do I look that easy? Son of a bitch! Let's see how long you can hold it. Ah, there is one more thing. Aren't you curious about who did that to your wife? Why, surprised? What are you so surprised about? You motherfucker! I know that even after serving three years in jail. But a cop like you can't even catch that mugger. Isn't that a shame? And I'm just curious... You know I'm a crazy motherfucker. If you don't want to rot in jail, go tell Ki-chul! You may walk out of jail, but not from death! Okay? Ah, I'll take a good care of your wife. No, after I kill both of you, I'll kill that bitch too. So she can keep you company. You son of a bitch! I'm sorry but I can't show you. What? Why not? The patient asked not to show it to anyone. Why can't I take a look at my wife's medical record? I'm sorry but there is nothing... Look. I am the father of the baby she's carrying. Why can't I see it? God damn it... - there is no problem with moving date? - Yes. You are lucky to have a new tenant right away. - The amount of correct? - Yes. # Happy birthday to you... # Happy birthday to you... # Dear... # Dear... # Happy birthday to you... There is something on the cake. What can that be? Wow, it's a ring... It's very pretty. Is it Mi-jin? You left your phone, didn't you? Su-yeon, I'm sorry. I'm not going back. So go back now. I'll repent for the rest of my life. I can't even breathe just looking at you! How can I live like that? Just leave me alone! I can never forgive you. Never! I know you can't forgive me. But what about our baby? Don't worry. I had an abortion. I was scared and afraid that I might have a child like you. Why do I have to live like this? Why do I have to live like this? You didn't do that. How could you...? Su-yeon! Su-yeon! That's not true, right? It's true, so go back! Go back now! If you don't, I'll kill myself. Let go! Let go of me! Su-yeon! Su-yeon! Su-yeon! Su-yeon! Su-yeon! Su-yeon, I left my cellphone. Somebody home? Su-yeon! Su-yeon! What happened? Su-yeon! Su-yeon! Who the fuck? Motherfucker! Hello. You bastard! Stop! Motherfucker! Let go! - You're a dead meat now! - Let go! Who the fuck parked like this? Motherfucker... Hey, where the fuck... where the fuck... Hey! Yoo... Chang-won! Who... who's there? Plea... let me go... - Did you call Det. Kang? - Yes, he's coming right now. Chief, isn't it strange that Ki-chul and Sang-tae got hit few days apart? Yes. Good job. - this is detective Min. - I'm Cho. Yes, nice to meet you. Who found the body. The body was found during a search after a report was made. A report? About 5:30, the orchard owner saw the suspect. He said the suspect ran away after trying to kill him too. And the victim's vehicle was found... ...about 10km away from here. Let's take a look at the scene first. Since the lower torso has already been paralyzed, it has been about 8 hours. Phew... His face is a mess! Anything yet? Everybody just stay low, until contact you again! Boss, should we just kill them all? You crazy fuck! We don't even know who did it! Stupid bastard... It's not the time. Where the fuck did the car disappear to? Damn! - Hey, Min. - Yeah. - you finish this up. - Yes, sir. Hello? Is this Detective Min? Yes, speaking. Who is this? This is Yoo Chang-won. Let's meet. Who did say? I have a juicy information about Sang-tae and Ki-chul's murder. You fucker! What do you want? Let's meet at the auto junkyard where Sang-tae's car is at. Why there? You'll know when you come. And you must come alone. Okay. What time? I need to know where the junkyard is before I can set the time. Come to the junkyard at Kyesan-dong. It will take me some time, so let's meet at 8:30. Okay. Bingo. Bingo. Bastard, why isn't he here? Fuck, what are these? The customer is not answering the call... What's going on, damn it! # Lonely night, # what's shaking my window? # Sleepless... Sir! Did everybody take a day off? Why is it so quite? Is it because it's Sunday? The number you have dialed is... Who are you? I hit a woman. She was a hooker. Why did you hit her? You must have done something bad to end up here. I walked in here myself. If you went to fuck, just fuck and go home. What the fuck did you come here for? I'm not in the mood to listen to your jokes. Beat it! I'm not joking. What is it? Are you messing with me? What do you want? Do you want me to turn away? Or do you a favor and give you a light charge? What charge do you want, then? Bye. What are you doing? Let's do it. I just want to talk. I haven't had many customers today. So let's do it quick. Okay? Why, don't you like me? Call someone else then... Fucking shit... Look at me when I talk to you! What are you doing? Is this a show? I really just wanted to talk. If you just wanted to talk, why the fuck did you go to a hooker? You are a psycho, aren't you? I needed someone to listen to me. If I just poured out what was on my mind, perhaps I'd feel better... To you, the reports we write is something to take down... ...what you motherfuckers babble about...? It's fine, if it's not. Hey, you! You are at the police station! I know that well. Oh, tough, aren't you? Why did you hit her instead of talking? I killed her. And, so... You killed that hooker? No. Fuck, are you messing with me? Who did you kill? I asked you who did you kill, you son of a bitch! I killed... ...my wife. What? I didn't plan to kill her. It happened accidentally. Your wife? Accidentally killed her? I was really out of my mind then. When was it? 5 years ago. Why are you turning yourself in now? You could have covered it up. I wanted to, if I could. But I couldn't. Why not? Because I'm a human. You felt guilty, huh? If you have committed a crime, you deserve a punishment. How did you kill her? Is how I killed her, more important than the fact that I actually killed her? I did kill her with these hands. This is not a place to confess a crime, but a place to keep a record of crime. And that's my job. - you know Yong-jun, right? - Yes. He's working at the club 'Crown.' He should know where Chang-won is. What's going on? Hey, Min! Min! Have you ever loved someone to death? Crazy fuck! Love? I've loved criminals to death, you piece of shit! That's cop's love. Must have been a terrible love for the criminal. What the fuck! Am I a navigator? Why does everybody come to me? I don't know. I don't! Speak up, damn it! Okay, let go first. I'll talk if you let go. My god, you're quick. If you ended up marrying her, isn't it a happy ending? I also thought everything could've been forgotten. But... That was all... These dirty hands swallowed whatever was left. What the... who the fuck? Assholes! Hey, who The fuck broke The mirror? Yes? Stay alert, you prick! That's a strange habit. The hands are the farthest body part from the heart. That's why you don't know what they're doing. Don't forget where you are. You are at the police station. And you are a criminal! In an hour, you're going to kill me. Sir, this is Min. Did you hear from Det. Kang? He's at the office, why? He's pissed drunk and sleeping at the office. The more I loved my wife, the consequences got more brutal. Cut the fucking bullshit and speak up! What did you come here for? You motherfucker. Who do you work for? Is it Ki-chul? Or Sang-tae? At least once... Shouldn't love be able to forgive anything at least once? What a crazy fuck! That's not love! That's fucking obsession, you asshole! Obsession? Obsession... Then someone can rape a woman in the name of obsession. I'm just curious... Why did you try to kill such a pretty wife? And you're a cop. Wounds may heal. But sins can't be erased! # Wow, money! Money! Your secret has been revealed because of Yoo Chang-won. Even Det. Min should know everything by now. You must take care of him to cover up everything. Isn't that right? Why? Can't do it? If you can't, I can do it for you. No! No! Who are you? Me? You! The memory you want to forget! Cut the bullshit! I don't know you. Sure, you want to deny it. You always wanted to. You don't know me well enough. It doesn't mean shit to me to kill a piece of shit like you. You motherfucker! It doesn't mean shit to me! Get it? Don't look at me like that! Sure, kill me. Then you'll be in peace. All you have to do is pull that trigger. Do you have any regrets? This is the only way to be forgiven. For both of us. I'm not afraid. If you shoot me, you'll be in peace. So shoot me! Shoot! Shoot! Shoot me! Son of a bitch! Motherfucker! Detective Min! Inside... No! Min-woo! Min-woo, don't do this! No! Min-woo, no! Right... I want to kill you. And rest in peace now... Who told you about Su-yeon? Okay. I'll take care of it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Su-yeon, I'm sorry. Get your dirty hands off of me! I'm sorry. I'm sorry... Go away! Please go away! That can't be. Right? Su-yeon, our baby... - Back off! - I'm sorry. I'm sorry... - I'm sorry. - Just go! Chief! I left you a heavy burden. I think it's time to pay... for my sins. Please take care of Su-yeon. Wish everything can be forgiven with my death. I'm really leaving you now. So please get well. Please get well. I really loved you. Please believe me. I really loved you. Su-yeon! Will I be able to forgive myself?
