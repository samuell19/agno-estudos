Come on then, come on come on Come on then Come on Kate, come on girl Come on, come and see your calf Come on then girl. Come on then. Hello puss. Come on then Kate. Come and see your calf. In you go. That's it. How are you Kitty? Alright? What's that then? Is that a calf over there then? You're a daft old thing, ain't you? Eh? Come on. Come on then. That's it, push up. Come on then. Good girl. Come on then. Up you get. Hello little fellow. Come on then. Let's put you up in the pen. Come on then. That's it. You're a little calf you are, aren't you, hey? A little fellow you are. Come on then. Come on, out you come. Alright. Come on then little fellow. You're as good as gold you are, aren't you, hey? Are you wondering where you're going? Let's see your mates. Hello little fellow, a new mate for you. That's it. Here you are mate. I've always drunk milk and I love our milk I always have done As a boy I used to drink a pint without thinking about it Whereas whenever I've stayed with aunties or uncles in London or whatever having to drink shop milk it just tasted horrible I just didn't really like it at all Even though it is milk and I am passionate about milk The milk that the consumer is getting in my eyes Is pretty unpleasant st... well I shouldn't say it's unpleasant stuff not doing the dairy trade any good at all but It is not what I think milk should be. Come and get your raw milk! Raw milk, raw cream, raw butter It tastes fantastic! Come and get your organic raw milk here! Hello. This is raw milk, unpasteurised milk, straight from the farm. - Fantastic! - It tastes wonderful. We are quite a small herd these days, we're 72 cows, which is quite small And also our cows live a long time The average age in the country is about six years Ours is about nine or ten. Is it because they eat properly? Because we're very relaxed with the cows We don't push them hard So because they are a lot happier, they are a lot healthier And that comes through in the milk I'll finish it then Yeah, go on - It will be good for me Yeah. It is good for you! It clears up eczema, hayfever It lowers your blood cholesterol as well So amazing stuff raw milk. It makes you look twenty! That's right. I'm really ninety! The calf doesn't have her mum to suckle It will be the first time that she has her mums milk But out of a bucket and not straight from the mum Come on then. Up you get. I know your calf's in there Hello little fellow! Come on then That's it. You suck my fingers! They're being really excited Because they know there's milk there They're not sure how to get it Because it is not out of a teat No? It's not going to happen? It is the toughest day in the year for the mum That's about it. You did pretty good. Didn't you, hey? So we're not so bad after all. We're going to give you your food from now on. We've looked after your girl very well She knows her calf is in there It's the first time she hasn't gone in with her calf But she'll be a bit upset, because she... They're really talking to each other, aren't they? Yeah. That, I'm afraid, is life A cow has to have a calf to have milk Given that situation, we have to manage it as best as we possibly can for the cow In terms of minimising its stress When we separate the cow from the calf But it has to be done. You cannot have calves on cows forever They've got to be taken off the cow at some point - Yes? - Hello, it's milk! Just a minute This is Ida, who is on the milk bottles We want to do some promotional shots in Eastbourne where we're going to start a new milk round And we want to take Ida into Eastbourne But she's not halter trained at all None of our cows are halter trained at the moment So we're going to have a go at putting her on a halter And now I am just making friends with her And bribing her with a bit of food Get your head out of it! Come on! God, you're strong Get your head out of it. That's it. Good girl! That's a good girl Alright - Actually, can you open the gate, Paul? - Yeah. Come on girl. Come on then. Let's get you used to walking Shall I take the food? Yeah, that's a good idea Just hold it like a yard in front of her That's it, give it a shake and she'll... That's it Keep walking her round You are not bad, are you? We can do what we like with you, can't we, hey? Aren't you being good? She's not trying to get away or she's not bothered about the halter No Alright, okay then Ida, we'll let you go You can go up the field with your mates You're quite a pretty old thing really, aren't you? Thank you! Yeah you are as well, Paul Come on then, come on then. Come on then. Come on Ida, you're getting your photo taken from over there Hello Ida, hello. Hello darling! We could be all day here, couldn't we? Actually there's going to be more people as it goes along You're beautiful, aren't you? I hope they're going to give you a special treat when you come home We've got some feed here. Here you are. You hold your hand out flat, she'll take this off your hand. Is this a new venture for you? We've got a door step delivery in Hailsham and we're going to start one in Eastbourne It is going to be raw milk we deliver. Unpasteurised. So is this unhomogenised as well then? Yeah, well this has only been filled this morning In a few hours the cream line will be about down there And you have that on your cereal You've done really well, haven't you Ida? There's a good girl You've done really well, haven't you, hey? We've never had a cow from the Hailsham herd up here before Smelling a bit of sea air You are a good girl, aren't you? You like Eastbourne, do you? Come on then girl. We'll go home now You really like it up here, don't you? Come on then, we'll go back home. Come on, Ida! It will be better to back the trailer up to her! Yes, that's it. Well done Paul. Come on, Ida! Come on, Ida! I think Ida just wants to live here now Like a lot of people she wants to retire in Eastbourne Back with your mates again You'd think they hadn't seen each other for a long time Go on. Your mates again. Got all her fans, come to say hello to her. Yeah, that's given us maybe some ideas, we'll use Ida more. 'cause you lot, I don't think you lot are going to be as good as Ida. As much as you'd love to get the sea air. Have you come and say hello? Do you want to go back to Eastbourne, do you? Hey? Do you like that? But you haven't been milked, you're going to get milked this afternoon now. Which should be alright, you haven't got a lot of milk, have you? Coming to the end of your lactation. We've got a heifer that calved in this field. She calved a bit early and had a big calf. And the calf was dead And she's got paralysis in one of her legs and hasn't been able to get up I can't see her at the moment which means she's probably laid right out She's sort of on her side and can't get up I imagine It's a nice heifer, so we don't want to loose her. Hello girl Are you struggling again? You've moved quite a bit though I'll give you a push up in a moment You want to try and get up? How did you get over here then? Did you walk over here? Did you? Up you get then, come on, up you get You don't want to know, do you? Okay, I'll give you some grub Are you thirsty? How are you going to behave with me now? Are you going to be alright with me? That means "Get off! I don't like that". Isn't it? Now you've got your grub you can shake your head at me, can't you? There's a good girl. It ain't too bad, is it? You wouldn't have let me do that with you earlier on, would you? Let's hope you get better You are a pretty little thing really Within a group of animals you'll always have a friendly one And you'll always have one that doesn't want to know you at all But if a friendly one follows you And two or three then follow that one and then the rest follow then you've cracked it It is harder than it was in the past because the numbers of cattle per stockman are a lot higher now I think the average numbers per stockman is something like 150 cows per stockman now Whereas 20, 25 years ago that would have been between 50 and 75 probably Our ratios here are like what they used to be That's why we've still got that relationship, but it gets harder once you get into big numbers To know your cows individually and to have that relationship with them. Are you going to get up? Do you want to give it a go? What are you thinking about? Don't you like me sitting here? What's going on? Are you going to give it a go? I'm surprised you haven't drunk anything Come on then, come on then. We'll leave you, shall we? Shall we leave you? I've got cows to milk Come on, Kate. Come on then. That's it. Well done. She's over there, she's walked about 100 yards from where she was earlier Brilliant to see her up The only trouble is she's walked 100 yards that way and I want her to walk that way to join the herd Which is going to take a bit of doing, but anyway She's over there, we've seen her and I'm really thrilled that she is up again after a week of being down Which way are you going to go? Are you going around the trees then? Or are you going to follow me? Come on then. Come on then. Good girl, that's it. You know where you're going now, don't you? You lot had thought you're coming out, didn't you? Tough. You're not. The only thing is, because she's a weak cow, some know she's a weak cow and bully her a little bit But they are more interested in coming out She's alright She's just going down into the field now Which is good Hi Dad, it's me I still have to come and bottle I'm just going to have a bit of tea first Okay, see you later, bye Oh bugger I'm not very domesticated Is my saucepan alright? Yeah, it's fine Our saucepan, darling You put the heat on and then you don't put anything in it How do you know? I can hear it You've got a very good hearing when you want to haven't you, darling? Pardon? You have got a very good ...yeah... Case in point Is it a nice bath? - Yes, thank you. - Good. Are you sure you don't want a glass of wine? - I have one. - Have you? Claire cooks everything really. We don't have any ready made stuff Use our own beef, which saves a fortune The boys enjoy that What have you got then? What have you had? You had that quickly, didn't you? It's alright. A big calf. That's quite a good size calf and she did well to have it on her own But it's a bull calf, a friesian bull calf So that on most dairy farms that little fellow would be shot at birth, taken away and shot It doesn't see its first day But we keep all the bull calves and he'll grow to become a beef animal So he'll have about two and a half years on the farm He was quite a big fellow, that went in. He was about three years old, old Kato. Something like that, I reckon He was never very friendly, not like some of the others Some of the others you go up to and pat, but he was always a little bit wary I don't know why. He was castrated That normally quietens them down He had a bad infection in his foot when he was about a year old Which we trimmed and that cleared up I don't know how he'd done it. He cut the back of his hoof in some way Otherwise he's been fine Kato has had a pretty brilliant life for a dairy bull calf born on the farm Alright, Tinky It's me, you daft dog. What have you got then, girl? Bull calf You are a big old fellow, ain't you? Can you get up already? Shame it's not a heifer calf. We've had lots of bull calves recently. What do you think then, girl? I can't think which one that is. It must be your 6th or 7th Oh my goodness! Come on then, up you get. A little friesian heifer calf. Quite a good size. They don't normally calve down here Come on then. Follow your mum. We better walk you up the farm. That's a surprise? Yes, it's a surprise. It's a bit early. Its still got a very fleshy navel Oh, don't clear off You look out Tinky. She won't like you being about. That's it. Follow your mum. We'll get through these rushes, in a minute You'll see where you're going a bit better then Bess, you're right in the way. It's your calf, girl. Come on, you. You're going the wrong way. Come on, trouble maker. Go on. Hello trouble. How are you then trouble? Get up, go on. You would think she was the mum Come on you, come on. Up you get. Being all possessive. You keep going, little fellow. Come on, it's not your calf. It's your calf, isn't it girl? You won't have yours for another two weeks yet. Or three weeks. Come on, go and join your calf, go on. Good girl, that's it. I'll put you some fresh straw in in a minute. That's good. Come on then. Oh, you dozy... you dozy animals. Are they going through the brambles or coming back? Well, stuck in between. Poxy animals. What a job that was. Hopeless, wasn't it? O dear, oh dear. Fit as a butcher's dog. [crows calling } I wonder whether she's dislocated her hip That's enough, Bess! Hello, it's Steve Hook from Longleys farm, Hailsham Could I have a vet to look at a cow this afternoon please? She calved a few days ago, quite a bad calving And she had paralysis in her back right leg She was walking two days ago, in the field But now she won't get up at all Her leg just doesn't look quite right Half two? Great, okay. Yeah, that's great. Thanks very much. Okay, bye. Potentially she has eight years of milking ahead of her It's right at the start of her production life that we're going to lose her If the leg's no good But if she can't walk to the milking parlour and get milked, then she'll have to go Right. Let's get you some water. Hello trouble We've lifted her up I think she's got a dislocated hip She's got a dislocated hip? If you go on here... listen You can hear it clunking Well, basically she's got no chance really The annoying thing is, there's probably actually nothing wrong with her She's great And she's a second calver as well Just sort of really getting to a good part of her life Oh well. It's a bit of a bugger, isn't it really. But at least we know now. Oh well You just feel a bit robbed really It's not a nice way for a cow to finish its time on the farm But you have to do it If the cow is in pain and can't get up, can't walk And there is nothing that can be done for it You have to have her put down And that's the end of it It's not very nice like... you know, when Ida goes, that'll be a very sad day Because she is... there is a difference between Having a great relationship with the cows Being able to stroke them, and go up to them and they're alright with you and so on That's one thing, but then A little bit further on from that, they almost become a pet, which is where Ida is And that is where it becomes harder Just that little bit of a closer link or relationship But then Ida, she might end up staying here as an old girl and see her days here I wouldn't be surprised Hello girls. Milking time. I don't know where Ida's got to Probably at the back there somewhere Yeah, she's at the back Come on, Ida. Come on girl. What are you doing then? Are you going to come and say hello? You remember Andy, don't you, hey? You remember the cameraman? That brings back memories of Eastbourne, I expect? Doesn't it? You're daft old thing, ain't you? Go on then, in you go. You're not going to Eastbourne today. Hello you lot, you must be pretty thirsty. Water. You need some water, don't you? I went to a farmers' meeting not so long ago Only a month ago And a chap, he farms in Oxfordshire He reckoned that TB was spreading down the Thames About 10 miles a year He's never had TB in all his 60 years he'd been farming And they just got it The day I saw him he had 50 cattle being killed for TB And he was, you know, really upset about it Why on earth can't TB be eradicated? If TB was eradicated then the badger population would be healthy And the cattle population would be healthy Why isn't it eradicated? It's not eradicated, because... there's an uneven policy in terms of eradicating it In that cattle that have got TB are being killed Badgers that have got TB aren't being killed That's where the imbalance lies Come on. Push up. That's it. Hopefully we won't have any conclusives or any reactors And then we can say, be on the next invoice We've just had a TB test TB is the one really, because the way that's... That's going to be in the news - Oh, she's a bump, is she? - She has, yeah. No, that's fine. She's got two lumps but the avian one is much bigger So that's fine Alright, so that's alright then It does worry me when I see you stopping and writing things down Come on then Come on then Come on then There's always one Come on then Come on then That's it! That wasn't too bad We've just passed out TB test Animals are TB free Which means we've got another year of selling organic milk as raw milk Alright girl You're not coming out What number of calf will this be for her, Steve? I don't know, number eight? Something like that. If Ida does't get on with it soon I'll put some ropes on its feet and start to pull And then she'll start to push... anyway Alright girl, alright Good girl, that's it. You start pushing. Alright, there's the nose It's alive Popping its tongue out Come on, Ida Have you got another little Ida, have you? Come on, Ida. Keep pushing, girl. What I've seen of its face so far, it looks like its mum Got that white sort of blaze down the middle of its face Come on, girl, push, push, push Push, girl, come on, push Once you get the head out, it isn't too bad Come on, girl, push. Come on, let's have the head out. Nearly out, isn't it? Come on, nearly there Nearly My feet keep slipping Nearly out! Come on push girl. I'll pull and you push. I can't pull you there. Too close to the wall. If I can't get it out, I'll have to get a jack on it And you sort of ratchet it out then. Just the head. As soon as the head comes out, she'll be away Come on, Ida, keep pushing girl. Yeah, go on Come on girl, one more big push Here we are, look! Well, it's got Ida's face. Come on girl. Keep pushing. Come on, we need to get the shoulders out now Come on, Ida, push! A bit more, come on. Can't have you stuck on the hip Bull calf, isn't it? Yeah, a bull calf. Here you are girl, look what you've got then. You're a good mum, ain't you? Straight in there. A bit disappointing its a bull calf. Well very disappointing. It'd be nicer if it was another little Ida So he'll end up being a beef animal, this one. Sad really. Most dairy bull calves get shot at a day old. He's got the genetics of producing milk but he's a male, so hasn't got a home. You must be worn out Ida. All that licking. Right. Another cow calving up there. Oh my word. We've got another cow calving. But the heifer, she's holding her tail up, which is a sign. It's gone a bid mad suddenly. Come on girl, keep pushing. Do you want to see what you've got then, girl? What have you got? Heifer. Hello darling. Yeah, carry on without me I've just calved two cows and I have a heifer about to calf as well It's all gone a bit manic Yeah okay, bye. Been waiting for me, are you? Mind yourself That's it. Round you go. Round you go. Go on then. That's it. Round you go. Come on then. Come on, Myrtle. Come on, Kate Come on, Ruby. And you're another Kate. Come on, up you get. You know, you work hard, keeping a herd of cows And the milk goes away in a milk lorry And you get paid 27 pence today for our milk 27 pence per litre And it's costing us 34p a litre It's just money literally down the drain And it just makes you mad really Why on earth can't we be paid a sustainable price for the milk that we produce Instead of being ripped off and forced to struggle Running at a loss and living of benefit? What's the point of going down that route? The tax payer is paying for it really The tax payer is paying for cheap milk We're getting paid below cost of production The supermarket earns loads of money, profits out of us We can't even pay ourselves a wage out of the farm So we claim working families tax credit to live It's just bizarre really Why on earth can't we farm Work our 60 or 70 hours a week farming Produce a product which is a high quality product that the supermarket buys But why don't they pay us a price That allows us the dignity to pay for our own way of living I don't know, that's what makes me angry It really does The family farm is dying very quickly in this country And as a result there's a whole generation That's not coming through onto farms to work And all those skills are being lost All those stockman skills, husbandry skills just aren't around People just aren't going into it any more, because there isn't... what's the point? You know, y ou work hard for nothing So, why do it? I get asked that several times And the only reason we do it is because we have found a way out By retailing direct And it's given us a chance. It's given us the chance to stay here Right, here goes So that's that And then they fill up again. You put the next six in. Well yeah, you do this It's filled them up to the right level Those ones are pretty good Well if we... Let these five go through And that one will catch up next time They're all filling quite well now We're bottling in the new bottling plant We've done 200 in 25 minutes Yeah, okay bye. Willy Wonka bottle, that one. It's a Willy Wonka bottle, it hasn't got any markings on it Anybody who gets to see the Willy Wonka bottle can come and see the Hook milk factory Come in - Hello See what you think Oh my goodness! - Haven't you seen it before? - No! - It's all sensitised? - Yeah, and they all fill to the right level. Oh my word! This is amazing! Well, we started half an hour ago And you've done 200 in...? We've done nearly 300, haven't we? 300 in half an hour? Yeah, you can all have a go Hold on, hold on... oh yeah, you can press it now, go on That's it. What's the red button do, dad? - What does that button do? - Uhum, yeah... Alright, press the green one again! That's it! Where' the milk coming from? It's pumping it in all the time. Press the red one - Hey? - Where's it from? - It's pumping straight from the milk tank. - Cool! Alright, okay, push that forward Giles! Push it right forward, more, more, as far as you can reach You got it, now pull it back Now press the two green ones! Yeah, result! You can do this job! That's it! Six more bottles, boys. Press the two green ones again, well done, that's it Giles! I'm pretty pleased with it really. It's going to change things quite a lot. And it does seem a bit more professional suddenly. Ow! That was my head, that was. - It's not the right height, is it mate? - No. Right then! You're not coming out today, you lot aren't. Only this lot. You're the lucky ones, aren't you? That's got you all stirred up Look at this one She's biting my elbow Saying "come on!", weren't you? You're going to keep biting my elbow telling me to get on with it? She is literally having a go at my elbow then Reminding me that I was... Come on then, come on then! You're coming out now then? I know, I know. Alright, let's open some gates! We're just going to let you into the yard for a start You're not going into the field straight away Alright then girls. Are you ready to go out then? Ready for playtime? Aren't I rotten, hey? In all winter, haven't you? Now you want to go out, don't you? And you are wondering why I'm not letting you out Are you going to come out then? Are you ready Myrtle, to come out? Come on then! Come on then! Take your time! Look at Nelly! They picked up some dust coming through here, didn't they? Come on then girls, come on then! Come on Ida, that's it, c ome on girl You're missing the fun Come on then, this way Here we are. Come on then, come on then Hello girl Hello Ida Alright, let's put a halter on you first Hello girl That's it. You've had this done to you a few times, haven't you, hey? - Do you want her standing up? - No, fine. That's it, okay. Good girl, Ida! Do you want to stay down here today then? I don't really remember you being ill - Have you seen her passing any dung? - Yes, it's been very liquid. - Her breathing is a bit... there's a bit of effort there. - Yeah? Nosey lot over there. They wondering what's happened to you. There's quite a lot of noise coming through. I'm not sure if it's definitely her heart, but if it is then it's really fast. Right. A bit strange. So she's not giving us many clues at the moment. No. She is definitely in pain And I'm a bit worried about that odd noise. Possibly a wire. A wire? - Yes, as in she's eaten a wire. If she has eaten a bit of wire or something like that - there's not much you can do about it, is there? - No. A little bit dirty, but not very. Could she've eaten a bit of plastic or something like that? Would that do it? It's normally a wire, because it perforates through Especially if I can hear strange heart sounds It might be that it worked its way from the rumen into the heart Into the region of the heart Blimey! Come on, Ida! Oh, you're on my foot! Steve reassures Ida Good girl Are you in? Is it anything to do with her age, do you think? Because she's 12. - It could be heart failure. Possibly. - Yeah? But it doesn't explain the pain Normally a pain like that, combined with heart noises, is generally a wire. But all you can do really is try and feed her up. Try the anti-inflammatory and see if that gets her eating a bit more. Yeah, yeah. We'll check on her in a couple of days and see how she's doing. Okay. - Fingers crossed. - Yeah. Thanks, Nicky. Hello, Ida! How are you this morning then, hey? These flies are a pain, aren't they? I'm going to give you a drink of this stuff Good girl. Keep swallowing. Try and get your rumen going a bit. You're not happy, are you, hey? You're not happy. You're just not happy, are you? You're not even chewing your cud. Hello Mike. Just a quick one Have you got a metal detector? Come on then. Out you come. - She's stayed in the shade, hasn't she? - Yeah That's intelligent The rumen really is... Yeah, in there. - That's a lot, isn't it? - Yeah. It starts up here somewhere. Yeah, but it does come right up in here, the rumen. Yeah, so it goes in there. No, it's right up in her neck! It's even up here! I wonder if it's something in her throat then? It's right up here. It starts there. Maybe that's why she's not eating? If there is a bit of wire in her gullet. Well Ida? Try not to stand on my foot! I'm going to phone the vet, I think. You need to nose her - Gosh, she's been eating a lot of mud. - A lot of mud? She must have! Mouth's full of mud! No. I got down to there Which I'm actually quite surprised I did - Nothing. - Nothing? Okay. I mean she still looks quite good Just that she is so hollow I wonder where she's hiding today? Oh, she's over there, I think. I've got something a bit different for you today, girl. I got you some yogurty milk I'll give you your jabs first I know you won't like it Sorry about this, girl. Good girl I'll give you a dose now See what you think of that girl. Do you want a drink? Or shall we tube you? Here we are. Don't you fancy that? You don't really, do you? Let's see. What's that then? You're making a few more grunts and groany noises today, aren't you? Have a drink? Do you want to have a drink? Have a little taste! You're not happy, are you, hey? You're not happy today, are you? Not want a drink of water? Water! Do you want some? I didn't bring you any cake down, did I? You might have eaten a bit of cake. I didn't think about that. You just don't fancy it, do you? I have to leave you I'm afraid. I've got to be somewhere else really. See you later, alright? Hello, I've got a dead cow which I'd like to be collected, please. In a way it's nice that she died down on the marsh, with all the other cows around her She didn't die alone down there She had all the milking herd around her last night All her mates Today she's going to be picked up and be taken off the farm So it's the end of an era really Yes she was a symbol of what we do really She epitomised what we try to do Not a great producing cow, lived a long happy life And had a great relationship with us all on the farm She was just a lovely cow But all the cows, when they go, it's the end of one of the characters Because they're all characters And when they go you lose that character But then as time passes you have happy memories Like her mum, her mum was fantastic and it was very sad, when her mum went But then later on, you just have happy memories of the cow And then you just think: yeah, Ida, she was a great cow, she was one of our lovely cows And then characters who aren't even born yet come to the fore And it all happens again So like everything on the farm, it's a cycle You've got to appreciate the bad moments to enjoy the good and vice versa It's not an even thing all the time Yeah, but she, she had a good life She's the only cow that's been to Eastbourne, for example But yeah, life moves on. It'll be another Ida or another Kitty Or one of the others, that takes the mantle Becomes the new queen of the herd We'll wait and see who the lucky lady is. Morning girls! Are you all here, are you? Are you all up here? Let you in the milking parlour, I think. Looks like you are all up here! Blimey! Mind yourselves!
