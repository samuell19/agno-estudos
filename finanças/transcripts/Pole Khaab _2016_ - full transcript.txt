Watching this movie is not recommended for people under the age of 18 - Hello. - Hello. Give 10 to the poor boy! He's written as much as a 6. I gave him 9. Will you take me to school today? I want to go to the agency and take you too. Eat something. BOOSTAN CAR RENT AGENCY DAY AND NIGHT - Hello. - Hello. Sit down. I'd told you about him. An old friend from the same neighbourhood. - Shahab and Mohsen are the same. - Thank you, Mohsen. - Tea? - No, thanks. He talks highly about you. Hello, Mrs Qadimi. Right away. Where does she go? Siroos! Why Siroos? Mrs Qadimi. Bye. It was my turn. - She says you overcharged her. - What? She doesn't want you. What the heck! Loony woman! She gave a 50,000 travellers cheque. I returned the change. I took her stuff from the boot and she asks for the rest. Am I responsible for her mind? She is old, OK. She mustn't nick me. She remembers paying but doesn't remember taking the change. - She must nick me? - Don't go her trips any more. I won't. I'm not in the mood. - Smoke outside. - I haven't lit it yet. - Sure you don't want tea? - Yes. That is mine. Goes to Farmaniyyeh. Shit luck! I've been waiting long to go somewhere near? - Farmaniyyeh! - It is near. They are near. I'll be back in a jiffy. Take the petrol card. Have tea. Bye. - You are married? - Exchanged vows two years ago. - You did the shittiest thing! - Everybody says the same. You shit on your life! What do you expect others to say? When do you come? Makes no difference. Whenever you say. - Dayshift, nightshift? - Whenever you say. - You're making fun of me? - No! I sleep a little. So it is up to you. What marriage is that? No difference between day or night? - Heshmati! - He's coming. Come, dammit! I have a few relatives in the neighbourhood. I don't want them-- Tell Heshmati to block their numbers. We haven't got our licence yet. Be careful. I sure will. What do you want from God? You've been begging Him for 3 hours! It wasn't even 5 minutes. Take the phone. He thinks they'll give her that ugly girl if he says prayers! Something else. How can I put it? Nobody comes here to ask for me. You've cheated someone? You're in debt? Yes. What did you do? My partner took everything overnight and left me with more than 300 million debt. My mother's stepbrother. A brother spills his brother's bowels on the street for 1000 tomans. You want to pay that big debt by working in this darn place? What can I do? Sit at home- Where are you going? I have something to do. I'll be back soon. My car is on lease. Must pay the instalments. And I have bosses in the street everywhere. I'll do this for the time being. Everybody says the same. 'For the time being'! - This is Mr. Behroozi. - Hello. What'll happen tonight? Obvious! Tractor will win. Tractor rules! There is everything here. Tea, clothes, everything. Shahab! Your first trip. I wrote the address. You know around? Yes. Goodbye. Hello, sir. Don't pay attention to what he says. He says something when he is high, something else when he goes cold turkey! I don't care. Don't get angry. It was my duty to explain. He is fine now. But sometimes he bites like a dog! Hello, sir! Let's do it. I must go. It'll be late. It's very cold. - Wanna get high? - No, I can't sleep. And must see Neda today. Loony woman gave a 50. I told you? Yes. Never mind. Let it go. If I hadn't, I'd have thrashed everybody now. - Father slept so early. - Yes. - What time is it? - 1:00. - Your father didn't call? - No. You said he's gone to Dubai. It's very cold downstairs. Go to the room. It is warm. No, don't turn it on. It is good this way. Why you always put on my clothes? I like it. You like my smell? Saffy Neda didn't leave too early last night? Yes. Because of her father. His excessive zeal is a problem too. He doesn't recognise even exchanging vow. He doesn't consider your situation. If he knew my situation, he'd have got his daughter's divorce by now. He's told Neda 10 times to finish it. They argue every day. Neda hasn't told him anything, surely? What can she say? Eat your breakfast. You'd better talk to him and find out what he wants. - We've talked a lot. - Well? He says, "You proposed very classy. Get a house and take your wife home." Nobody knows what use the wedding is! He doesn't understand. You haven't talked to him recently. I want to. I'll tell him I'm going to prison up to my ears in debt! That is my new problem. Don't upset yourself so much. How he swindled us easily! - Where have you been? - Took me all over the city. He left to come back but didn't. - You were fucked up? - Go away! He is right. Go gave me a trip for Za'feraniyyeh last night. But she went to Navvab. I swear she said Za'feraniyyeh. I don't want to tease you. You don't. The girl wants to sound classy in front of her friends and says... ...her mother lives in Za'feraniyyeh. But she wants to go to Navvab. And I'm the clown here! Shahab! Your trip. - Yes? - You asked for a car? - Wait a few moments. - Sure. Look at their red lights! It jumps from 200 seconds to 3 and stays there. They are sick to tease people! I hope That I get out of this country very soon. and get rid of the smoke and traffic! Why are you so quiet, boy? You are shy? You're going abroad? Yes, Paris. Then America. Have a good journey! Very nice! Damn them! They make me sick! You know what, son? There must be an earthquake to kill half of these people! The traffic problem will be solved and we can live comfortably. We have bad people. Dirty, rude, liars. Look at the police! They can only give tickets. He is a dickhead. You can leave. Why have you stayed? Because I love Shemiran. Maqsood Beik St gives me serenity. I've been abroad too. Nothing's happening in the damn place either. I love this mountain. But nothing can be seen of it! Who is it? Creditors again? What do you want to do? How many times do you ask? I want to go to jail. Go to jail! Here. You may have to pay. - Take it. - I have money. OK, take it. What does his fiancé do? Filthy rich! Guess it's them. Hello. I'll park and return. What's the matter? Why are you like this? What should I say? What do you have to do in the morning? Nothing We could stay a few hours. Indeed! I am so worthless to you you wanna go to a trip in this situation? You are so smooth It isn't bad to socialize a little. Even when someone respected us and invited us over for one night, but you won't come. - Yalda knows my situation? - What situation? Don't pretend. One look at her and I know she knows everything about me. My debts, working at the agency. - You've told her. - I didn't. And she has told her fiancé. You took me for a fool? Yes, I told my friend. You'll burst if you don't talk. That is why they look down on me. Because they know I'm miserable and penniless. I talked to Yalda only once last month when I was very sad. - So don't say you didn't. - That's all. And I don't understand what you're saying. I think you're delusional because he was rich. You were hostile to him for nothing. I'm not a fool not to notice. He is wealthy, why do you want to pay? To say you are proud? He would pay. Why did you give me this? I thought you might have to pay, not to rush to pay. I'm just finding out you talk like that in front of me. Talk how? You stared at him and laughed to his jokes you made his confidence so high. He is my friend's fiancé. It is the first time I see him. What should I do? And you are sour as vinegar! You know nothing about public relations. - You didn't let him get close. - But you do let that well! Watch your tongue! I'm different from them. Your father is right. You are young and want such things. - You are influenced by your father. - And you are influenced by this job. You're all the same. Your mouth waters when you see money! And you can only find faults with others. Take a look at yourself! He took your money and left. Don't worry. You'll find some inside trader too. Yalda an old one, you a young one! Go to the crooks team. Open the door! Open up! I know you are in there. Don't you hear? Yes? He isn't in. I'm his father. All right. I'll come to the door now. He'll come next week. He wasn't a bad guy. We'll wait a little and then go. What do we do next week? I've talked to Farahani. We'll sell this house and give his money. - How much? - 143. Who is it? The real agent, I think. Answer it. Yes? Hello. ((Chatting about the house)) What will you do if you sell the house? God damn the man who made this trouble for us! - Your father is fine? - Yes. I shouldn't have let them do that business. But I did wrong! The yard is this way and the kitchen. Hello, sir. Please be seated. You saw everything. Anywhere else you want to see? - No, we want to build apartments. - Then no need to see. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. They can only demolish for a new construction! How Much? Almost 400 million okay I am going to rest upstairs No... Have you told about the wedding to your father? Not yet Yes he would He in wondering about us and he asks why do you keep on waiting for your wedding and you don't even know what you are doing Is working in a taxi service going to help us now? Let me go first Why are you in such a hurry What can I do when he's gone to Canada with my money? The old man is selling his house at 70. I can't take pocket money from him. By God I was willing to go to prison. He didn't allow it. We'll rent somewhere. Just convince your father. Okay What's the matter? Where are you going? Home. It's late. What do you mean? Neda! Where are you going at this hour? Don't come after me! I'm talking to you! What does it mean? Neda! - Hello. - Hello. How are you? We were talking about you. - They call you Shahab the Classy! - Why classy? Because he is classy. Mr. Berenji! Will you go to Bahar? No, my car has broken down. - Siroos, you go. - Right away. I had a fare last night. A real tart! Smoked coloured cigarettes. Gave me a red one. I said, "Thanks. But you must smoke that because it matches your lips and mouth!" Oh sis Even shit is not becoming to my lips; He is so funny He doesn't know his limits He speaks about sexy stuffs all the time He is jackass! - Was it funny? - I didn't laugh. The girls in the car are like one's own sisters and mothers. - Tea? - No. Mr. Berenji! Bokharest Ave! My exhaust pipe is ripped. - Your exhaust pipe ripped? - Badly! What is it to me? He's very rude. He shouts. - Chegini is your own fare. - Don't shout! I must beg you for a trip? I'll go to Chegini. Nice fellow. - Educated! - Just like you. Educated and high class! He's a real colonel? No, he was an orderly! But he sports a colonel moustache and calls himself a colonel! Turn it up. Turn it up. over and over. yeah. Hey! Animal! What's the matter with you, sissy boy? What is it to you, skinny? Listen, beauty! Behave if you want to work here. Forget it. He's become our headteacher! - They are stupid. - Yes we are. Why are you bickering with them? Don't look for trouble. Do you know them? He lives beyond the shanty town. Wherever! They beat you to death in a gang. They'll bury you there too. They all go to the police and say they killed you. They can't! There is law. There isn't! Open your ears, close your mouth. - Don't play Robin Wood for me! - Robin Hood! I said the same! Any child knows that. I heard you had trouble. What do you want to do? 400 million debt and it goes up. What can I do? Eat me! Slap me! Who's talking about you? - How much is it? - No need to pay me. Just behave properly. Leave the damn mobile! It is Neda. So much debt! Even when someone marries a girl whose father is filthy rich, after all he regrets it like shit. I love her. Does she love you too? Sure she does. Or she wouldn't stand up to her father for me. Come on! Who falls for the like of us? Mohsen, go to Qadimi. She is going to the shops. She can go alone! Why she needs me? She's talked behind my back. You go. You go, Shahab. Miss Polite is going to buy the whole world! Don't say that about the boss clients. Or he'll halve you! It isn't a lawless city. I gave a 50 traveller's- Forget it! You said that 100 times. She is our rich client. Give me a cigarette. Rich! What the old widow has? - Just a house. - Shut up! She was my client for 6 months. I took her son from the airport. He cried blood because of his mother. What are so many keys hanging from her? He said his mother has 6 houses and gets their rents. She has a wardrobe with $200,000 cash in it. He said he didn't take a shower abroad not to pay the water bill. Don't talk nonsense. They've left the father in a rest home. Poor man lives on the government's help. He is old as an old donkey! He says he doesn't marry because he doesn't have money. And she dresses up and bosses people around in the street. Who does she think she is? She thinks she is the queen bee! You used to call her 'madam' all the time. Here's an agency. You must respect the customers. I'm a driver not a porter. Once I carried her shopping bag for her. My bladder was bursting. I asked if I could use her toilet. She said no. Go, Shahab. He'll talk the same till morning! I'll smoke it and go. She'll turn you to lime till you return! Your fruits are all rotten! Rubbish! Don't say that, hajja. They are God's blessing. I'm not a hajja! Take it. It is too much, mother. Thank you. Give the rest to your mother! He is my age and calls me mother! Everybody calls you mother in this country! The richer they are the meaner they become! - What her husband goes through! - Never mind, go. Put it here. - Thank you. - Welcome. Wait! - You paid in the car. - No, I didn't. You did. Here it is. - You sure? - Yes. I can't concentrate in this hectic city! You lose yourself! I'm young but I don't remember what late today. It is because of air pollution. But you are a good boy. Not everybody is like you. Very kind of you. Don't you hear? Nothing to do with kindness! You are good. - Close the door. - Sure. Goodbye. Can I use the washroom? - Why not? - Thank you. - Here you are. - Thank you. Shahab, there is a Bank Melli nearby. - I want to pay my Exit Toll. - Sure. The police officer was very handsome. Men become handsome when they wear a uniform. Here's Bank Melli. - Let me park somewhere. - Thank you. Save my number because the warden is here. I might have to drive on. Be my guest. - You didn't have a smaller note? - Keep the change. The problems you said, everybody has them. I'll call you. Okay lets do this Suddenly you will disappear They will look after you and will get worried about their money And then your father can buy all of your debts by 10 percent And he will get your cheques back Where is my cigarette? My father won't do such a thing Oh God thanks a lot here there is an old woman who does not know what to do with her money and here we are waiting for a passenger for a trip; Is she wealthy? She was my passenger before, I used to take her to exchange her money everyday 3000 dollar for her pocket money. I told you that I took his son to airport once he told me that they use to call her mother 6 million dollar woman. Ohhh That's why she complained behind my back to the manager. I'm going to buy cigarettes buy me some Don't get involved with those drivers Calm down. What's the matter? Hello! What's the matter? Sit! What's the matter, Neda? What? She's had a fight with her father. What does he say? What do you expect? He's found out everything. - Do you want me to call him? - No, thanks. He doesn't know I've come here. He'll upset you too. OK, then. What does he know? I told him we won't get a house or afford the wedding. We argued and I told him everything. Everything? Shouldn't he know what's going on? It's getting two years. Bravo! You started telling the truth right now! I'll go. He'll come now and make a scene. What does he want? I don't know! He wants to talk to your father. It's obvious what he wants to say. What's the matter with you? It isn't his first time. What do you want to do? I'm thinking. You are? You want to think? You are really cheeky! What are you doing? Why did you panic? Where you took it? What are you saying? You're imagining thing. Yes, I am. You use crystal and I imagine things? - Shame on you! - Quiet! So that is the reason for your shitty behaviour! You did that in the restaurant because of this! First ask if it is mine. That's all we needed in this situation! It isn't mine. Don't take me a fool because I'll feel sick with myself! I should've ended it when I saw it for the first time. Lower your voice or I'll beat you! Shut up! You swore to your mother's soul. Shut up, I said! Nothing matters to you. You swear falsely. My father is right. You won't get right. It's no use. You've surely told your father too! No, I didn't because of my own reputation. He hates you so much I don't need to say anything. What is it? I'm sorry. Goodbye. Wait. Where are you going? Hello, Mr. Farahani. This is Ebrahimi. The buyer you talked about, his money is ready? Yes. Tell him to come. Today is fine. I'll be waiting. Thank you. Goodbye. We'll borrow some money and give that jerk's money. I called everybody I thought might do something. I begged, I implored! But nobody gave anything. People have all become businessmen, economists! One says dollar has gone up! The other says Euro has gone up! Only I don't know what the hell to do! Wait! Neda's father called last night. What did he say? Divorce! You don't know that jerk. I'll talk to Neda. You've dressed up so well Where are you going? One of my fares, Mrs Qadimi, is going abroad. She's thrown a party and invited me too. I said I couldn't go, but she didn't accept. She is a good woman. OK, go. You have nothing else to do. But tell me. Have you called Neda? Where am I going? Neda knows her. I see! - Hello. - Hello. - Here you are. - How nice! Where is Neda? Busy with her exams. Couldn't come. What a shame! Come with me to the kitchen before the guests arrive and help me. Sure. Put the tumblers on the table while I make salad. No, take the glasses first. They are dusty. Use a handkerchief. Sure. Not that! That one! It is your fault. I told you to bring your wife to help you, but you didn't. You'd better wash them. Who can it be? Must be Latifeh. Always comes an hour early! Yes, it is her. - Hello, Latifeh. - Hello, Manizheh. - How are you? - Thank you. Engineer didn't find out you were coming here? Never mind him! He'll come and say why I talked to this, laughed with that! - Let us be happy for a night. - Never mind that jerk. Come in. Be careful you don't tell him anything. - Hello. - Hello. Shahab, Mrs Samavati belongs to one of the noblest families in Tehran. Nice to meet you. I'll get ready. Excuse me. It seems I'm very early. - Can I do something? - No, Shahab is here. Shahab, wash the fruits too. How long have you been working for Mrs Qadimi? Work? I've just met her. Latifeh! Come help me. Coming. - Manizheh, put it in the safe. - It is the title deed? Bring whatever you have or that jerk will smoke them all! Come on up. - What is his name? - Shahab. Men are all the same. Old or young! Don't look down on him. He is young. - Why did you barge in, boy? - I thought you called me. - No! - Sorry! Mr. Behzadi, don't you need anything? I'm fine. Mr. Moshiri? Shahab, drink for Mr. Moshiri. Why don't you start? Shahab, don't let the glasses remain empty. Take some for Mr. Moshiri. For that blond woman on the sofa with a nose job too. Sure. Watch the doorbell too. I've ordered dinner. Put these dishes in the washer too. - Where is your usual servant? - The bastard left me in this situation. I had to call Shahab, but he didn't bring his wife. He is good. Introduce such cases to me too. Shahab is a gentleman. He is like my son. How is your own son? - The loser is still a burden on me. - Don't call your own son a loser.. Men are all son of bitches. Unless proven otherwise! It is the food. There is money in the first drawer. Shahab! take these dirty dishes. Don't you need anything? I'm tired. I hope they go sooner and I get rid of them! I can help if there is anything to do. You just sit and laugh with Mr. Sa'adati! - Me? - No, me! - Here you are. - Thank you. Shahab, dear. Take this. I've come to a party, not to work. Come on! Don't be shy. You'll need it. Wipe the sweat. Why do you sweat so much? Bring your wife for help next time. She is our bride, you know! She must help too! - Sure. - Thank you. Mop the kitchen before you go, dear. It is sticky. Thanks. Don't you fool me mahmoud! I'm not an Idiot I am not a cheater. Get out of my way. Shahab! You want Mohsen? - He isn't in? - He left. He is looking for crystal. Shahab! What? - You want work (crystal)? - Do you have it? Asking me? Come. Turn it on. Fuck you! Hello. Mrs Qadimi, you aren't in? I'm Shahab. I won't go to the agency for a few days and my mobile is one-way. It is my father's mobile. Call this number please to go to the airport. Hello, madam. I'm coming. Cigarettes? One box? Sure. - Hello. - Hello. - You were in the gym? - Yes. You look paler. Did you get cigarettes? I forgot. We'll get it when we're going. No problem. We have 10 minutes. - I'll make a few calls upstairs. - I'll smoke then. - Smoke outside. - Sure. OK, dear. See you. Bye for now. Shahab? Shahab? Manizheh? My God! Message from NEDA I'M PREGNANT Shahab? Shahab? They called from the agency a few times. You've been sleeping for 40 hours. What's the matter with you? You're ill? I'm not well. Stay at home today. I'll go to the agency. I'll give Misaqi's money today. Dirt bag! Never mind. We'll be rid of him. I wish you hadn't touched the money from the house. If the first cheque hasn't gone to the bank, it will be easier to call off the deal. What miracle are you waiting for? You're carefree. Keep it for now. There might be news of him. You said he'd gone to Canada to seek asylum. He's talked to Mohsen. Mohsen has asked him why he did it. He's said, "I haven't swindled Shahab. I'll call him." I don't believe it. Wash the boot too. Wash everything. It stinks! Don't you forget my tip. You move corpse with this car? It smells like dead sheep. - What? - Your car's a hearse? Yes, there was a sheep. Yes, I'll send it now. Siroos! - Is that how you work? - I was ill. - Why you didn't call? - It happened suddenly. - Where have you been? - I was badly ill. I called your father. What is it? I want a little work. Work! You know what I mean! I'm watching you. I introduced you here. You used it with those yobs? - I want only a few grams. - Indeed? I just offered you once. I don't want them to give you rubbish. - I'll bring you after my trip. - I want it now. I'm not OK! You have withdrawal symptoms. Go sit in the car. Get the key. Smoke outside! I'm going out. I'll leave. I won't stay here. I'll go when the schoolchildren service finishes. What job is it? Driving round the clock some filthy rich people for peanuts! Three grams. Use less. Don't look at me. I'm different. I'm careful. I haven't lost one gram, but you're losing weight by kilo. You see me and think nothing will happen. And when I talk to you, you hit the roof. - Hello. - Hello. - You ruined him too? - Yes, he is ruined. Hello, cool guys. Give it here. What are you doing? - They say the fag and babes-- - Cut the crap! Smoke! Heshmati is not in one day and it is how our office is. - What if someone steals everything? - Steal the papers? Anybody knows anything about Mrs Qadimi? - You, Shahab? - I was ill for a week. He was ill. - Wasn't she your fare? - What's happened? She's disappeared. Where did you disappear her, naughty? Stop the nonsense! The police were after her here. She had a ticket to go abroad but she didn't. One of her friends has gone missing too. Her husband is looking for her. They might be together. Most probably some men raped them, and dropped them in the dam reservoir! Why do you talk nonsense? The Criminal Investigation officers were here. Colonel talked to them. You tell them. You didn't go to school? You're distracted. I am off today. I'll get it. - Might be a creditor. - Doesn't matter. Yes? Yes. Yes. Sure. One of her friends has gone missing too. You are Shahab Ebrahimi from Boostan Car Rent Agency? Yes. - You know Mrs Qadimi? - Yes, how come? You didn't hear anything in the agency? I heard some things, but not completely. You were her driver. She's gone missing for some time. What does it mean? - When did you last see her? - The last time? I took her to some currency exchange shops. Is that all? There was a party in her house too. I went there to work, but I don't want my friends to know. What else? I took her here and there a few times. Nothing special. Sure? You can ask the agency. They have the slips. - Is this your number? - Yes. What about these? Do they look familiar? No. You're not going on a journey now? Journey? I took her to buy dollars for her trip abroad. Is there something to worry about? - How come? - You've come here. If there was something to worry about, we wouldn't have come like this! I didn't think it was so serious. I'm at your disposal if you need me. We will come if we need you! Bye. Hello? Neda. I was with you on 16th. 16th! 16th! I'll tell you. Bye. - Who was it? - Wrong address. I see! Why do you look? The tablet is stuck in my throat. I'll go out for an hour. What's the matter with you? Wait! Why are you doing this? What is the story of 16th? Didn't your father wanted our wedding to be in a garden? I don't want a wedding or garden. I don't want anything! What is the story of 16th? Say it! We didn't have money to have a wedding till yesterday. Now you want it in a garden? - Where do you think I was? - You tell me. - Will you believe me? - Yes. - In the agency. - Agency! You said you'd believe. What should I say so you believe me? I don't know! There was a misunderstanding. The officers came to the agency and- And you said you were with me! Listen! I'll send the car right away. Colonel! Yes sir. Go your last trip. What were we saying? They questioned me at the door. When, where. What is it to me? You were her driver, after all. They must ask you. Her son has returned. He is after the case. He must come. Mohsen was right despite his stupidity. She was very rich, right? - Is he a real colonel? - Dunno. The guys call him colonel. When your father came here yesterday, they were talking for two hours outside. He'd become so talkative. My father came here? You know him? I don't. Mohsen said he was your father. Colonel and Berenji talked to him for an hour outside. They were talking with each other for hours. your father is a charming person. - Thank you. - Bon appetite! After some time, there was smell of food in this house. - You didn't eat much. - No, I had enough. - Bon appetite. - Thank you. Why don't you eat anything? - A little help won't kill you! - I'll be back now, darling. What did you want to tell me? Shahab says we have a wedding soon and then go to Turkey immediately. Your going has nothing to do with the coming of the postman the other day? Which day? What's going on, Shahab? Why have you become so unruly? Farahani is my friend, but you cancel the deal in a way I don't find out. I know he is keeping everything from me these days. What have you done? What are you doing to yourself these days? Are you paying attention? I am worried for you. Don't be. I gave you the title deed and told you everything. I'd tell you about our journey too. We will take you later too. Thank you very much! Very kind of you! What? What crime have I done again? You are my wife? You didn't want to tell him in the end? I mustn't tell you anything. You drive me crazy. Why are you talking nonsense? Stop it! Don't you want to go? - Your daddy won't say anything? - You're telling me to get lost? You think I don't know why you look like that? - Why you behave like that? - Don't be funny! You told him everything. - What are you keeping from me? - What are you saying? Get changed. I'll give you a lift. I don't want to! I have a car. My! - I don't know you any more. - My God! Are those eyes the same? Your eyes have changed. They aren't kind any more. No, they aren't kind any more. What do you want to do? Nothing. You know well what I'm saying. Ebrahim! ((Abraham!)) Abraham! I heard You, my Lord. Reach not your hand to your son. I know that you are faithful to your god. I wasn't paying attention. The chain was closed, but I thought it was open. I drove into it. The bonnet, bumper, everything tore apart. I'm ruined. Do you need money? Hello? What's the matter with you? Leave me alone, Neda! It is a loan or bribe? You think I'm a jackass? I don't understand anything because I laugh? Boostan was saying something about the old woman. Your father came to the agency. CID officers came to your house. Yes? Hello. I'm in the agency. I'll come late. Is it important? OK dad. Don't leave the key in the hole. Bye. I'm not your friend? We haven't been friends for 20 years? Have I not always backed you up? You hide it from me? Even if you've done a crime, I'll back you up. What did you do to the old woman? Beat her? Where is she now? Shahab! Tell me! I finished her! What did you do? Did her in. She invited me to a party one night. I was lucky Neda didn't come. The old lady took me as her servant. She asked why I hadn't taken Neda to help. I was belittled so much. You were belittled. What then? The last night I went to take her to the airport. I went in. I don't know why she trusted me. I bashed her head with a sledgehammer. You bashed her head with a sledgehammer because you were humiliated? She fell on the ground. Don't tell anybody. My God! Don't tell anybody. My God! She was still dying at the same time the doorbell rang. It was her relative. I panicked. Her body was in the hall and she kept ringing. She would draw everybody there. I didn't want to be caught there. Just wanted to get out. I opened the door and she came in. Both of them? The key was hanging from her neck. I'd found out in the party. I can't believe I've done such things but I haven't killed myself. Where are the bodies? Got rid of them. Where? Pol-e Khab, Chalus Rd. Whatever you said was right. What did I say? I walk and talk fucking nonsense! You did that because of my crap? She is dead. By God I don't know what happened- Father?
