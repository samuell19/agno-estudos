The Buddha believes there are eight bitters to suffer in the six paths: the birth, senility, illness, death, entangled with disgusted persons or matters, separated with the beloved, failing to get what is sought for or a flourishing sadness. Life runs in cycles like a wheel, we're all enveloped in the cycles. AUGUST 1986 GRAVE OF THE HUO NIANJUN Mom, if grandma knew I was moving back to the mainland, she would feel glad. The day finally comes. Yeah, it's been seven years. Meng, pick some thick clothes, as the winter in Beijing is very cold. Will Papa like me if I wear colorful dresses? He likes you with whatever you wear. Meng, haven't you finished picking clothes? I'm looking for my grandma. Grandma, won't you go with us? No, grandma won't. I've been accustomed to living in Taiwan after such a long stay here. Then I'm not going either. I'll stay with you. You silly girl, don't forget if you go to the mainland, you'll see your father every day. Meng, are you bothering your grandma again? - Is everything ready? - Yes. Mom, don't worry. I know I'll be happy. Yitang is your own choice, Mom believes your choice is right. This key is for our No. 81 ancestral house. It was left to me by your grandma years ago. Now it's yours. Meng, don't be as stubborn as your mom. She didn't live in the decorated new house, but in the ancestral house within the second ring road. No. 81 is our ancestral house, isn't it good for fallen leaves to return to the roots? It's easy to say so, but it makes Mr. Zhao very busy. - Have some. - Thanks. JINGCHENG NO.81 Come on in. Look! What a magnificent courtyard in your house, with such nice lighting! What a magnificent western design. So special! How can it be an unlucky house? I wonder if your ancestors were very rich. - The hall is over there, come with me. - Ruoqing, your ancestors had a good taste. There's a lot of furniture inside, they are all valuable antiques today, so I kept them all. I've been here so many times that I almost see it as my own home. Come on and have a rest. - Drink some water. - Okay. Pour a glass. - Here you go. - Thanks, aunt. - Would you like some water? - Okay. You're home now, Mr. Zhao. Uncle Gen. This is my wife, Ruoqing. She comes from Taiwan. Mrs. Zhao? Then what about the Miss Glaze... It's me. I'm just a passerby and I'm helping him. I'm too old to be clear-minded to distinguish them. I have to stop bothering you. If you need anything, I'll be in the ancestral hall. - I'll go then. - Okay, thank you for your help. This Uncle Gen is really somebody. When he was Meng's age, he was already working in your ancestor's home. He's almost 80 and has never left this house. Sleep well by your own. - Good night. - Good night, mom. Sleep now. What's up? I feel there's someone else in the house. Really? It's your fault. Since you're not by my side, I'm hallucinating. Really? My great writer, as you said, I'm your inspiration. When you open your eyes in the future, I'll be by your side. Glaze Printshop had a composing issue. Hurry here and resolve it! I have to go out. There's something to address in the printshop. Yitang, do you and Glaze have anything hidden from me? What are you talking about? I'm going to talk about work with her. It's so late now. Can't you talk tomorrow? Your new book is being printed in the printshop now. There's some problem in the composing. Shouldn't I go to address the problem? You always put work first. What am I supposed to do here? Actually, I'm the same with you. Once at work, I utterly forget about the people and matters around. The author is like Zhuangzhou's Dream of a Butterfly. It's unclear whether Zhuangzhou becomes the butterfly... DREAMING BACK TO BROTHEL ...or the butterfly becomes Zhuangzhou? Maybe between the false and true, there's never a boundary. Hurry up... Hurry up. 1933 ZUIMENGLOU CLUB What did you see? As mild as a jade. Sister Dieyu, Sister Dieyu. It's so boring if we're the only ones dancing. Yeah. - Let's dance together. - Yeah. - Stop teasing Mr. Huo. - Please don't. - Come on. - You don't amuse him anymore. Mr. Huo is so handsome. - What kind of gifts do you bring to us? - Right. - Right. - Well, let me question you first. About what? Last time I taught you how to say "I love you" in English? I remember, I remember. - You're such a loser. - What's a loser? It should be "I love you." I love you. What about teaching you "I love you" in French today? - Good idea... - Good idea... If we know how to say "I love you" in French, we can go to the Paramount Hall in Shanghai. Let's dance. - I'll go with you. - Come on and listen. Je t'aime. - Re Dan... - Re Dan... Young master, you can't just say - we want real gifts, don't we? - Yes... - Gifts. - Gifts, we want gifts. Okay, here they are. - Real? - Real? It's from France. It's brought back for special purpose. - What's this? - Silk stockings. - Silk stockings. - For the leg. For the leg. Everybody's got one. Great. Let me have a try. Well, a pair is missing. A special gift for a special person. What's this? French perfume. When I first smelled this in France, it reminded me of you. Sleeky! Je t'aime! Time flies. It's another spring. Amid rises and falls, the ancestral manners persist. It's time for ancestor worship. Begin. To the commanding ancestors of Huo Clan, we have successfully opened the 38th shop of our Tea Stall in Tianjin. Blessed by our commanding ancestors, Huo Clan can enjoy the prosperous business and flourishing offspring. Today Lianxiu leads our clansmen to sincerely offer our filial piety to you all. The first bow. The second bow. The third bow. Ritual completed. ANCESTORS' VIRTUES LEAVE A GOOD NAME Lianxiu, since you manage the business of Huo Clan, our business is getting better and better. Just for this, we elders all feel more delighted and satisfied. As the firstborn of the family, Lianxiu has the responsibility to do so. But, Surong hasn't given birth to a child, Lianping isn't always well. Lianqi, honestly, isn't a serious person. For so many years, Huo Clan hasn't witnessed a male offspring. As the firstborn of the family, you should consider the succession of Huo Clan. The Fourth Uncle, I'm bothered by this too. Surong, I hear there's an epiphanic Bodhisattva Temple east of the city. You can invite an offspring-granting Bodhisattva, and have some TCM. I'm sure you can have two children in three years. - That's enough. - All uncles, as we gather today, I also want to take this chance to discuss one thing with you. My parents passed away too early. The family was supported by my eldest brother and eldest sister-in-law. In recent years, I have been studying abroad. Now, I feel it is time for me to share some trouble with them. Today, I would like to invite all of you elders to speak for me, let me marry a good wife. Wife before career. So I can bring honor to our family. Do you want to marry? Is there a girl you love? - Yeah, I have a congenial lover. - Who? Her name is Lu Dieyu. - Lu Dieyu? - Who? - Which notable family is she from? - How can it be her? Tell us. She is a starring girl in the whorehouse Zuimenglou Club. Ouch! Third Young Master, how come you will marry a brothel woman? This undermines social morals. - Absurd. - My dear brother, are you serious? Don't be silly! How come you can fall in love with a prostitute? - No, you can't. - Dieyu was reduced to a brothel just because she was born in a poor family, but she is more faithful and righteous than anyone I know. You should not go far beyond making accidental amusement with girls in a whorehouse. Our family has kept noble and innocent for many generations. To marry such a woman will be a shame to our clan - and even become a standing joke. - My dear brother, now, times have changed, everyone is equal in the world and has the right to freedom of marriage. That set rules of our ancestors should have been thrown away. What? I really should not send you to study abroad. You see, you even don't care about our ancestors. Are you still a human? To be a human, I must not let myself down and live up to the heavens and the earth. Lianqi, if you really love this girl, our family will help her be redeemed. After you get married with your legal wife, - we'll take her back. - Shut up! Eldest sister-in-law, thank you for your affection, but I Huo Lianqi is determined to marry none other than Dieyu as my legal wife in my lifetime. Lianqi... if you dare, you must not step into the Huo family any longer. Eldest brother, don't get angry, take it easy. Eldest brother. Third brother. Second Young Master. - Lianqi. - Spitting blood again. Hurry up... Meng, why did you wake up again? A sister is coming to play with me. A sister? Where is she? She says she wants to play football with me. Where is the little sister you mentioned? At the end of the corridor. Mom, this is the little sister. - Yitang, where are you now? - I'm in a meeting. - You're not asleep yet? - When will you be back? A boss wants to invest into our company. There are a lot of conditions to discuss. Remember to take your medicine before going to sleep. - Come back immediately after the meeting. - Okay. Kiss Meng for me. I hope Mr. Xu can marry me. So shameful! So shameful! As an emotional person, Mr. Xu keeps to his words. - Good writing... - Here you are. - Thanks, sister. - Look, Dieyu is so talented, no wonder the third young master of Huo is in such deep love with you. See, we all have different ideas, but they can be summarized in eight words. You all should remember we will learn to write in the next life. Only this can bring us a good marriage. Yes, learn to write. Sister, what's your dream? - Speak it out. - What's your dream, sister? - Let me see what's written. - Me too. Yeah, what are you looking for? - We don't know the words. - We can't read it. Hope I could meet the one to... spend the rest of my life with. - What's the meaning? - It means they never separate. Dieyu, Dieyu. Huo's family sent someone to redeem you. What? - Redeem, really? - Can't be better... Listen to me. Beside it, what a pile of betrothal gifts! Even the chaplet and official robes - are sent for you. - Congratulations, sister! - You're really lucky. - Congratulations, sister. Congratulations, sister. We don't want to separate with you. - Do I look pretty? - What about me? - You all look gorgeous... - Ready. Three, two, one. - My eyes. - So glittering... Hey, mister, What are you looking for? Haven't you met a beauty before? Miss, I didn't intend to offend. I've travelled to so many countries, but I haven't seen anyone prettier than you. Can we keep this moment? Three, two, one. Hope I'm the star and you're the moon, We're together every night. - So beautiful! - Sister Dieyu, you look really beautiful today. I'm more than envious! Here's the bride! Marrying an offspring of Huo's is the luck of several lives. DOUBLE HAPPINESS Perform the formal wedding ceremony. Let's welcome the groom. There must be something wrong with Huo's Family. Dad, what's this for? All distinguished guests, since my younger brother suddenly got sick, we have no choice but resort to the tradition of a rooster for the groom. - I hope you won't mind. - Where is Lianqi? - Where is Lianqi? - Please make salutes. Where is Lianqi? - He's ill. What's his illness? - Please make salutes. First kneel for the heaven and earth. - Second kneel for the parents. - What do you do to Lianqi? I want to see him. Couple kneels to each other. I wanna see Lianqi. - Ritual completed. - Release me. Send them to the boudoir. I wanna see Lianqi. Release me. LIBATION Be quick. Get inside. Where's Lianqi? Where's Lianqi? This is our second young master, Lianping. We planned to have this marriage to bring good luck to him. It's so regretful he's got serious tuberculosis, and can't wait for the marriage. He died this morning. How ill-blessed! I wanna see Lianqi! I wanna see Lianqi! - Lianqi. - Lu Dieyu, don't you want to marry a Huo's offspring? Now your dream is fulfilled. Tonight, you just stay here with Lianping. - Change clothes for second young mistress. - No, I don't want this, I don't. I don't want this! Release me. Release me. Let me go. Second young mistress, you're already married to our second young master. You also have to remember, from this day on, you are sister-in-law of Lianqi. Huo's Family is not a place you can come, or leave as you please. You're not a human! Release me. Send second young mistress to the coffin to spend the bridal night. PURE LAND BUDDHISM Release me. Release me! Release me. NUMEROUS MOUNTAINS DO NOT SPEAK AND BOW THEIR HEADS COUNTLESS RIVERS SING LIKE PLAYING THE FLAGEOLET TOGETHER - Dieyu. - Lianqi. Lianqi. It's okay you've come. It's okay you've come. How can my eldest brother do this to you? How can he bully a weak lady like you? Huo's family refuses to allow me to marry you, I'll marry you deliberately. My second brother is the one who loves me most. If he's still alive, he won't let this happen. My dear brother, please testify for us. I, Huo Lianqi, and Lu Dieyu, are marrying today, and will never separate. ...IN A FRONT OF A BUDDHIST Wake up in the morning, last night was a dream. When the beautiful dream ends, the nightmare simply starts. Mom, mom. Mom. Meng. Save me, mom. Mom, save me, mom. Mom, mom. Meng. Meng. Meng. Mom. Meng. What are you doing here? Mom, I'm scared. Can you sleep with me for my company? - How can it be you? - Yitang has something to deal with. He can't come. He asked me to keep you company. He asked you to come? Yeah, I also brought a bottle of red wine. You live in such a big house alone, you must be scared at night? I really think the house is weird. But when we come to do cleaning, it's said to be haunted. Haunted? What happened? I have no idea about the details. Don't you see anything strange? No, I don't. Oh dear, I don't believe there's ghosts in the world. I know you are brave. If I'm asked to live in such a big house, I have to ask Yitang to sleep with me every night. Cheers... You really think I'm afraid of such things? From the first day I met you, I knew you dared to think and do as you please. Like giving birth to Meng before marriage to Yitang, for instance. We all think you don't care about the certificate. How is it possible to not care about it? Waiting for so many years, is just for that certificate. Dear Miss, you're too naïve. This is not Taiwan. Unless both parties sign the divorce into effect, a law suit could be raised. As you know, how can an important person, like Yitang, appear in the court? That's why it's been delayed to now. THE TENTH ANNIVERSARY DREAMING BACK TO BROTHEL Thanks, all the guests, for coming to the new book launch of Miss Xu Ruoqing. Dreaming back to Brothel is the first book marking Miss Xu Ruoqing's return to the mainland. Our group is very confident and looking forward to the sales of this new book. Besides, Miss Xu and I has been friends for many years So, for personal or business purposes, Wenchuan Group and I will make every possible effort. Let's welcome Miss Xu to say something to us all. Xu Ruoqing is the concubine of Zhao Yitang. Miss Xu, I've read your works. - My pleasure. - My works are also primarily about extramarital relationship, cohabitation, and concubine. - She's a concubine herself. - Concubine? She does wishful thinking. She's a concubine herself. Don't you know? She's a concubine herself. There're many legends among the brothel girls. Nowadays we call them the concubine. - Miss Xu. - Concubine. Since you can write about brothel girls, you must have real experience? - She's a concubine herself. - Concubine. Concubine. This is not Taiwan. Unless both parties sign, the divorce can go into effect. How can a person like Yitang appear in the court? That's why it's delayed up until now. Ruoqing. Ruoqing. - What's up? - I feel sick. I'm not like a writer, I'm like a concubine kept by a coal dealer. Today the film begins to shoot. I, the concubine, am the heroine. How can you think this way, Ruoqing? I'm asking you, have you divorced from your ex-wife? If you haven't, I'm a concubine. I've told you before, I can stay in Taiwan and not come here. I cannot accept this relationship. I'll take you to see her. Moxuan. Hello, Miss Xu. Hands of a female writer are always unusual. So soft! I've read all of your novels, I can say I'm your fan. Thank you. Sometimes, the reality is more dramatic than novels. Do you agree? Life is like a drama. When I see you, I start to understand why Yitang will leave me. Men have different women through their life. When Yitang started his own business at a young age, he needed a woman like me to support him. Now, he's successful, he needs a woman like you to show his status. Yitang, am I all right? We divorced because we didn't love each other any longer. I hope you will allow us to be together. Allow for you to be together? Allow for you to be together? Allow for you to be together? It's time to take her medicine. There's no such thing as couples who don't quarrel. My situation today is yours tomorrow. Excuse me, but the patient needs rest. Mom, I saw a red butterfly in the courtyard. So beautiful! Can you help me catch the butterfly? Okay. Let's go! Mom, help me catch butterflies. This is it! Be careful! Slow down! Mom, come on and help me catch butterflies. I wanna move back to No. 81. It may be a mistake. But there's a voice somewhere calling on me all the time. Come back! Through days and nights, over mountains and rivers, you're put in front of it. This is perhaps the destiny. Mom. Meng, let's go up. Mom, butterfly. Mom will help you catch them. Lianqi, it's been over a month in Huo's family. Sometimes, I even recall the days in Zuimenglou Club. Because when I lived there, I could see you every day at least. I'm not scared. As long as your face shows up in my eyes, I can sustain my life. Waiting. Miss you as usual. Look forward to your return. Reply as soon as you see the letter. Dieyu. LU DIEYU Lianqi, see the words as my face. Unexpectedly, I'm pregnant. I believe this must be the gift given to us by the God. I just don't know how Huo's Family will treat our child. Look forward to your return for our family union. Reply as soon as seeing the letter. Dieyu. The doctor says she's been pregnant for one and a half months. - It's right when she steps in the house. - Impossible! Lianping had clearly laid down in the coffin that night. If they had sex, this would be a ghost child. Maybe it's a love child. Lianxiu, whatever the reason is, a widow got pregnant through ghost marriage. It's a big taboo! Of course, a child of unclear origin cannot be given birth to. Stop it! I think this is Lianqi's child. As we all know, Lu Dieyu had been dating Lianqi for a long time before this marriage. So, all the elders, I think this child deserves a life. He's the kindred offspring of Huo's Family. It's okay, but the gossip is worrying. - Keep it at a low profile. - I know. Butler, ask someone to clean up the basement for the delivery of the second mistress. They shall not be visited without my order. Serve her to take the antiabortifacient at the prescribed time. Yes. Let me take her there. I cannot believe the first person to care about me is the eldest sister-in-law. She asks the servant to arrange for my clothes and take me to the basement. Although the basement is simple and crude, compared to the outside world, it's more quiet and free for me. When the Boxers arrived in Beijing, grandpa built this house for the whole family to avert this uprising. You just stay here to nourish the fetus. Dieyu, you're a wise girl. When you give birth to your child, you will somehow have a dependence. I'm leaving. Eldest young mistress. I'm coming to visit Dieyu. She... is fine, isn't she? Yes. Second young mistress, Second young mistress. - Thanks. - Not at all. Dieyu, I received letters forwarded from the Zuimenglou Club, it's hard to calm down my excitement. It's hard to imagine that since the hasty separation, a winter has passed. Baby, your dad is called Huo Lianqi. Although he's always late. He never breaks a promise. We're here, away from anyone's disturbance. Your dad is sure to pick us. It's delivered, delivered. Eldest young master, second young mistress has given birth to a child. - Boy or girl? - You all wait here. I'll check on it. Boy or girl? Congratulations, eldest young master. It's a girl. Okay, have a rest. The nearest and farthest is the distance between east and west, the deepest and shallowest is the brook. The highest and clearest is the sun and moon, the closest and most alienated is the couple. Only by thinking of spending the rest of my life with you, can I bear this momentary separation. Without a clue where our love started, we've fallen in deep love. I cannot bear missing of you. When I return from studying abroad, I'll give you the rest of my life in return. Mom, you're writing letters again. Whom are you writing to? I'm writing to your dad. Who's my dad? Your dad is a handsome man, good-looking and talented. Where's my dad? He's gone to somewhere too far away, but he'll come back to get us soon. Is that okay? Nianjun, this rattle drum is for you. - Thanks, uncle. - You're welcome! Writing letters? Surong, I'm really worried about you. You see, it's okay if you fail to deliver this child, but now you're losing the person. - Well. - Put it aside. Nianjun grows up day by day, she looks like her mom, so lovely! Sister, this tonic is filled with marijuana. As long as she takes this for a year or so, I'm sure she'll go mad and incoherent. Will this be too mean-spirited? Sister, we're not killing her. If you don't make up your mind now, your position will be replaced. Surong, don't hesitate anymore. Okay, Surong, send this soup to Dieyu. For those years when Dieyu was married to our family, you cared even more about her than me. Don't be jealous! If you don't dare, let's do it. What are you doing? Hey! Ruoqing. You don't cast yourself too much into the creation. Don't write desperately. It's not okay to simply rely on hypnotics. Come on! Okay. Have a good sleep. It's okay. I'm here. Okay. Glaze, let's go! Haven't you confessed to her? It's not the right time. Ruoqing, how could you be here? I saw your new book launch days ago. I was thinking "How could this person forget to find an old classmate to talk about the old days?" Now you're a famous psychologist, it's not expensive, but you need to make a reservation. Except for talking about old days. But I'm really seeking treatment here. Since I moved to No. 81 house, I haven't slept well at night. I found a box days ago, which is filled with photos and letters. I often see strange things. What's up, my writer? Why not go to bed? You're still writing stories? Where have you been all night? You've drunk a lot. I was just socializing with a couple of clients. It's unavoidable to drink. You know, doing business, is like a prostitute. You have to accompany the boss. You don't do it separately, it's harmful. I'll have a shower. GLAZE Yitang, you can't have your cake and eat it, too. It's time to decide. Take it easy. Who am I? I have a meeting with an important friend. Let's chat when we meet. What happened? My mistress is in such a hurry to meet me. I'm busy to death. Your new book is finished, isn't it? Let's order first. Waiter. Mr. Lee. I know Mr. Zhao's temper best. Don't worry. This time it will be fixed. Okay... I'll call you back later. - One piece of this. - Okay. Please hold on for a second. I'm thirsty. Waiter, fill my glass with water. - That's okay. I'll just drink this glass. - Let's drink our own. Ruoqing, what do you want with me? I have no friends here, I just want to chat with you. Are you okay? I'm okay. But my friend, she found out her husband had an affair with his female subordinate. She's asked me what to do. Tell her she can divorce. What else can she do? Her husband doesn't confess this. Maybe they can redeem the situation. You should tell her ASAP, don't be naïve. All men have crooked hearts. He can cheat for once, and for twice. Divorce ASAP, divorce. - But they already have a child. - Children are just an excuse. Think it over. If the child lives in a family without love, where the parents quarrel every day, how can he be happy? What if she doesn't want to unmask it? Well... you can't have your cake and eat it, too. Men will make decisions someday. It's better for you to make decisions than to face the decisions he made. Your noodles. But I still don't understand why there are so many bitches in the world who have to accost other women's husbands. So disgusting! Waiter, what's your problem? Why did you give the things I ordered to others? What do you mean? It's okay. Anyhow, I haven't finished eating. Ruoqing, you can eat first since you're hungry. You enjoy taking others' things, don't you? What do you mean? What did you invite Yitang out for last night? - It's for business. - Business? - Does business require hugs? - Ruoqing, you're mistaken. As a matter of fact, last night... - You promise you don't tell her. - Why? She's been a bit mentally disordered recently. You'd be making her sad if you told her about this. You'll trust me in no time. Don't worry, I'm a good drinker. As long as they're willing to invest into our company, I'm ready to risk anything. Thanks, I have to owe you in my life. That's the story. Do you think I will accept this? Let me tell you, your husband and I are only common co-workers. I'm willing to give him support in work. That's all! Besides, do you need me to remind you? Who introduced you two to each other? It was me! If I want to have something with him, I won't introduce him to you. Thank you for your kindness. My new home is laid out by you. You even selected the bed sheet. Who knows if you have had sex on it? - Shut up! - You make me so sick. Xu Ruoqing, are you mad? Your husband's company is facing heavy difficulties, don't you know? You don't even care about it. To care for your feelings, he refused his ex-wife's help. What about you? You live in your own imagined world all day long. Jealous and envious. Let me tell you, it is you that shall be woken up. I doubt Yitang is having an affair with his ex-assistant. This female assistant happens to be my former best friend. I fell out with her days ago. Do you have any evidence? No. You're so suspicious. Do you believe there's ghosts in the world? Yes, and they will show up at any time. They live right in your mind. When you think about them, they will knock on your brain. I'm living in the well-know unlucky No. 81 house. Have you heard about it? You think too much. Sleep for a while at my place. Is everyone here? Yes. Eldest young master, please take a seat. - Hurry up! - Okay. Hurry up! Look over there. Where are Dieyu and Nianjun? - Nianjun. - Come on... - Give her some space. - Come on... - Come over here, Nianjun. - This way, second young mistress. Nianjun, Let's take a photo of the whole family. Okay. One, two, three. LONG STANDING AND WELL-ESTABLISHED HUO LIANPING'S SPIRITUAL POSITION Finally, you're here. Uncle Gen, how did you know I'd come? I've been waiting for you to come. You really look the same. You mean Lu Dieyu? She's your great grandma. I've been guarding this house for so many years, I thought Huo's Family would never come back. Uncle Gen, what on earth happened later on? The letter was left half finished. I was 13 that year, and Nianjun was only 6. Lianqi is dead. What? ARMY WARTIME OFFICIAL SOLDIERS DEATH CERTIFICATE Impossible! Lianqi writes to me every month from France. I even received his letters days ago. How could he be dead? It was written by me. YOUR LIANQI - You're talking nonsense! - I've known that on your wedding day, Lianqi went to your bridal chamber. Lianqi begged me to allow for your marriage. Eldest brother, I was too impulsive that day. I feel so regretful now. I never begged anyone, Eldest brother, please think about the second brother, please allow for my marriage with Dieyu. I still remember when father was still alive, he always taught us: "a harmonious relationship among brothers will help the whole family's prosperity". If you really feel regretful, go back to the hotel to pack your bags, go back to your home. Your marriage with Dieyu, we'll talk about it when returning home. Thanks, my dear brother. It's unexpected on his way to the hotel Lianqi was found to be an able-bodied man. FAMILIES SET OFF COUNTER-JAPANESE FAMILY LINE TO DEFEND THE COUNTRY PEOPLE I dare not say. I'm afraid you couldn't accept it. Beloved Dieyu, I miss you, I can hardly bear it. I asked Gen to send this letter to you, you'll definitely believe this letter is written to you by Lianqi. Your letter. You're my love, enchanting and eye-catching as today, It will never change until death. Impossible! I don't believe it! You must have stolen our letters. You told me in recent letters, you would like us to live a happy life. Do you know? It's also my dream. I've been sustaining the whole Huo family alone for too long. So tired! I always have an immature idea to take you away, to leave here, to live where we belong, to live a quiet life we want. I still remember, you told me in your letters that you chose to be with Lianqi only because of his appearance and talent. But seven years later, his appearance becomes blurred. The smell of his perfume also fades away. Only the letters are true. Every word in the letter is care and affection. When you feel lonely, it's the only thing to rely on. You're in deep love with this loyal and single-minded person. You're willing to have heartfelt connection with him for a whole lifetime. You're in love with he who writes those letters. The author is not Lianqi in fact, but me instead. You're a liar! You've been lying to me for so many years. I don't believe you. Lianqi is not dead. You go away! Uncle Gen, did the No. 81 house become haunted at last? Can't it be that the great grandma... Such an improper couple! Lianqi, we've been apart for seven years. If you are the one that receives my letters. You will reply the same, won't you? This is the new bridal dress, made especially for you. I'll wear it for you now, okay? Lianqi, even though you broke your promise, wherever you are, I'll always be your bride. Lianqi. Is it you? Lianqi. Lianqi. Lianqi. Can you take me away from here? I'm tired, really tired.

Eldest young master sold all the assets of Huo's family, and took Nianjun to Taiwan. He said he would take care of Nianjun for Dieyu to atone for his wrong doings. From then on, I never saw them. A noble family collapsed for this Lu Dieyu. This is maybe what they call the trouble-making beauty. Mom, mom, I'm sleepy. Playing tired?

You don't understand at all, because you don't have, or know, love at all. I just don't understand. - What charms does she have? - Let it go, okay? Just treat those of us destined to be a couple in the previous life. Destined to be a couple in the previous life? I am your legal wife, aren't we destined to be a couple in the previous life? Excuse me, okay? Can you allow for us? Then who will allow for me and our daughter? Xu Ruoqing gives birth to a girl for you, what about our daughter, Shishi? She's not your daughter?

Shishi and Meng - are already as intimate as sisters. - What did you say? Shishi has been living in the boarding school, hasn't she? I picked her up. I also asked Uncle Gen to take her to No. 81. Do as I suggest, and No. 81 will be yours. Do you agree? - You're really ill! - There's no couples who don't quarrel! The course of nature goes around! You're mad! Just now, when you were asleep, I checked your common medicine. It's not ordinary diazepam. It contains a great amount of LSD.

I miss you. Dad. - Dad. - Meng. I'm sorry. Are you okay? That's okay. Shishi is the child of me and Moxuan. I already know this. Uncle Gen. Third young master, they're all back. That's Huo Lianqi? Isn't he dead? - Don't come over! - Ruoqing. The eldest young master travelled far away that year, and left me to keep this house. Actually, third young master survived the war. On every death sacrifice of the second young mistress, he comes back. Today is the death sacrifice of Lu Dieyu. Third young master, Lu Dieyu's come back, but she's changed her mind. She's no longer the Lu Dieyu of you. They'll drive us away. What are you coming back for? If you don't come back, this house is ours. - Okay... Uncle Gen. Go... - Let's go... - Let's go now. - The family was ruined by you. Go! Let's go quickly! Go! Don't look anymore. Let's move! Buddha believes the cycle through six worlds will never end. In the earthly world, so many men and women are overcoming difficulties for only one thing: to spend the rest of their lives with their beloved. Did you find your beloved?
