RENOVATION I thought you re-lived your whole life as you died. I only see how we all... ...never have any real contact. He's not there any more... What do I care? I hate her. She's a career bitch. She injects poison into women's faces. Into her own, too, I bet. Every now and then she suddenly hugs me... ...and tells me she loves me. And feels my face as if I'm some sort of alien. Cry-baby! Swilling down his pills with red wine. Forever blubbering. Loser... Enjoying yourself? I just saw a classmate of yours. What's her name... Marije. Why not talk to her? She's nothing to me, that cow. Hey Tom. Just behave, will you? Don't drink so much. Your interview... Right now? - Yes, right now. See you later. Sweet of you to dress up so nicely. I'm very proud of you, really. You enjoyed yourself, too, didn't you? You're not okay? All those people... It's all a bit much for me. Jesus Dad, cut the crap. Tom! - What? It's true, isn't it? I want to leave. In that case, I'll go. But it's my day. Sorry, but I... Alright, you go. I'm staying. On your own? - Yes. There's some champagne left. I'll celebrate on my own if I must. Tessa, come home for a drink. - Please, go. I'm staying here. I thought it was you. - And I thought just the same. Where's the rest of the family? Gone home early. Not a quarrel I hope? - Oh no. And your... erm... family? That was just an acquaintance. I saw you on TV. You're doing well. - Thank you. What are you doing these days? I'm a building contractor. And I invest a bit in real estate. I'm finding them a bit of a nightmare, contractors. For a year now I've been living in a workshop of straw and loam. And all I have to cook on is a pitiful camping gas stove. But wait for the result! Then you've hit on a wally. I build a whole house from scratch in six months. Cheers then... - To our reunion, Tessa. Yes? Tessa, I'm totally... I feel so miserable. Why don't you simply go to bed? I wanted to have a drink together with you. I'm waiting here for you, is that so silly? I'll be there. Why is it taking so long? What? - Your house. I don't know if I should tell you. Is it a secret? - No. My husband's at home after a burn-out. He wanted to do some manual job, to build something. Shift bricks, dig in the earth, do wood-work. He wanted to work with natural materials and put all his love into it. So you said: good idea. Start demolishing our house. No... I didn't give him a sledgehammer and tell him to bash it all in, no. When he was doing a course he met a contractor who'd help out. What kind of course? - Never mind. Don't be ridiculous. The Return of the King. For men who've become impotent? - No. Men who want to work on their identity. And there he met this holistic contractor. Then they started the renovation. - And you're still eating sawdust. In case you need help. I'll take over tomorrow if need be. But you can also call me for other things. I think I'd better go. Then there's nothing left for me to stay. Are you here by car? Shall I give you a lift? - I'll take a taxi. I'm here quite often so I'll walk out of here on my own. Until we meet again then. Great talking to you again. Been home long? Why aren't you in bed? Oh, I'm in for another sermon. I wanted to wait up for you. Until you got home. Hi... - Hello, Hylke. So, we've got our job cut out today, mate. Hi... - Told her yet? No... not all of it yet. Told me what? It's the roof. The rafters suck up moisture like sponges. If we don't do something it's all going to collapse. What a surprise. But I'm sure you have a simple solution. Rogier and I would really like... ...a completely new roof. We're thinking of a floating construction of Finnish wood and a Spanish thatch. It's an extra investment but the return is tremendous. We can do a lot ourselves. - Like you've done so far. I have measured it so we can order. Start ordering? Really, you've no idea how thoroughly fed up I am with all this. We're way over budget and we're not even halfway there yet. You know what? I want a second opinion. Don't get up on your high horse. It's nonsense getting someone else in. But there's not going to be a completely new roof. Finish it the way we agreed. I'm going to have a shower. I'll go to the clinic for it. It's Saturday. - Yes, I know. What are you doing here? I was in the area. Charming. I heard it was for sale and I didn't understand. You can't have heard that. I've got a five-year lease and first option to buy. So my estate agent is talking nonsense. Why didn't you buy it yourself? The owner wouldn't let me. I think he wanted to wait for house prices to rise. I'll pop in and see him. I'll offer half in cash. They love that now. Put a few luxury apartments in. They sell like hot cakes. I'm joking. What's this used for? Facials. Chemical peelings. Laser treatment. Anything that doesn't require carving. You do that yourself? - No, I have my specialists to do that. I do the operations. Breasts, buttocks, bellies, the whole lot. Yes. If necessary, we could do open heart surgery here. Speaking of the equipment? I could do a minor appendectomy. We're all trained in general surgery and only specialise later. Clever choice, plastic surgery. Gap in the market. Never thought of that. You have no idea how many people get mutilated. It's wonderful to be able to restore them as perfectly as possible. So why did you stop? All those nightshifts, weekends on duty, endless staff meetings. And the money. And because of the money, yes. And? - And what? You made your pile? Everything you see, belongs largely to the bank... ...and the bit of cash that's left... ...goes down the bottomless pit called renovation. So no... Yet you're not happy, I see it in your eyes. What's that to you? If your mother hadn't thought me an upstart, it would have been different. I don't think so. - I do. You became a surgeon because your father was one... ...and you married a medical type to imitate your mother. It was entirely my own decision. - Yet you're stuck with a burnt-out husband. Who demolishes your house, spends your money, and is no help in your business. Johan, please stop it. Sorry... All I'm saying is: if you need help... I don't need help. - I'll be there. You kiss as deliciously as you always did. Idiot. I do think... ...it's stopped raining. Rogier... Hello. Hey, Tessy. Why... why can't you love me any more? I do love you. No. Rogier... I talked to Head Office. The current situation forces them to set priorities. And that means? Our bank has to cease doing business with you. Per when? Next month. But I have to pay my staff. And I've ordered new equipment. One could tap the market. Or merge. We feel mergers are the future thing. The man from MediTech wants to have a payment... ...before delivering our order. Tell him to be patient. I'll phone him next week. He will think that's too late and we urgently need the things. We'll find another supplier. I want you to do something to my double chin next time. I may find a new husband then. - You'll find one anyway. You have such a nice husband. - Yes, he's a darling. The way he broke off his career to support you. Marvellous. Few men can tolerate a successful wife. You'd better cherish him. - I do just that, madam. A change in the bank's strategy, he said. So the bank doesn't trust your business. Whereas I think that the future is yours. He also said they don't take any risk if they have any doubts about the books. You didn't do your own amateur bookkeeping, did you? In other words: you do have a creative accountant? The renovation is running up bills. How much? About two hundred thousand. Clever. Why are you telling me this? Doesn't Rogier know? Or can't he help you anyway? And you think I can help you. I will help you. Why would you do that? Because I've always kept that weak spot for you. And you for me, I think. Perhaps we need each other. I've got money and you are the best plastic surgeon in the country. I don't mind investing in it: A new chain with you at the head. Because you're good. And you're a woman. That works. Together, we could be multimillionaires. No. It's very simple. I pay off your debts and you repay me when you make a profit. You've worked it all out, haven't you? - Yes. Yes, I'm your salvation. Are you married in community of property or without? What difference does it make to you? If we throw in our lot together, that's important. Your husband could be financially awkward if you don't watch out. You don't earn anything now, but you're worth a lot. Listen, I love daydreaming with you about the future of my company, but... ...don't ask me to get a divorce. Did you hear me use the word divorce? How else do I get rid of him? Well, I don't know... Hello love, we've something to celebrate. - What is it? Funny how sometimes a person crosses your path who was just what you needed. I met this lady... ...and I'm sorry but she was a very attractive lady, too. She runs a company that brings Polish workers into the country. What she said about it sounded really good. - Wasn't that just what you didn't want? Exactly, so I did ask if they were used to working with ecological materials. She said they work with any material and that they are willing to go into it. And they really go in for perfection. Perhaps she can come round and provide a quotation. I thought so, too. I just wonder if Hylke will find it a good idea. Listen, it's our house and our renovation. Phone Hylke and that lady of yours. Hi Ellen, can I speak to Hylke? My condolences. There's our ministering angel, I believe. I'm Maugosha Zylicka. - I'm Tessa van Asselt. Johan Schouten, of Condor Building Contractors Ltd. I'm Maugosha's partner. Aha, you're married. No, we're not. Mr Zylicka... My husband is dead. Sorry, I... You couldn't have known. What are you doing here? I thought you might need some support. Thought about our collaboration? - I'm not doing it. I intend to keep my independence. Independent and in the claws of the bank? I offer you debt-free independence. You're still as peremptory as ever. I can remember you finding that delicious. However, let Maugosha do the renovation and it'll be finished in no time. Her husband ran the company before she did. He was probably the victim of a robbery. A lot of money disappeared. Was he killed? - Yes, stabbed to death. He was found in a burnt-out car. He must have been up to something. - Maugosha doesn't think so. Do you think it's a good idea to team up with those Poles? Come on, Tessa, you want the renovation to be finished. Those men work very fast and very well. It'll be perfectly all right. Is very beautiful, I think. He's asking when you want them to start. Now, please. - Sleep where? We sleep upstairs, but you'll do the living room first. He means to ask where his men are to sleep. Do they all have to sleep here? - Yes. It doesn't matter where as long as it's dry. It must be the custom. It comes as a bit of a shock. Do I have to cook for them as well? No, they cook their own meals. They can sleep in Tom's cabin and he can sleep here. What's come over you? We can't do that to Tom. It's only a month. Sorry, but are we in agreement? Then I can start planning. Perhaps you can sleep at the clinic? You'll have privacy and we can carry on here. Yes... yes, that's maybe for the best. Only the best is good enough for you! I want to see you. J. Come on, you learn to drink and be a man. Yes, darling. - Tessa? What did you say to Johan? - I don't know what you mean. The men have downed tools because you don't want to pay cash. Maugosha is angry and she says you phoned Johan. You take decisions, but you don't care what happens here. It's a misunderstanding. You ring Johan double quick and tell him the money's coming. Idiot. Hello, sweet. Could you send those men back? There's a misunderstanding. They claim I'll won't pay them. I heard as much. I'll see what I can do. Then will you tell me you'll team up with me? You're not blackmailing me are you? - No, it was a joke. But they do want to see cash or they'll start somewhere else. We have a contract. Pay them cash and they'll be back tomorrow. Are you at the clinic tonight? Why? - I'll come round at nine with a surprise. 250,000 euros. Now you can pay your creditors, the Poles. All that sort of thing. You'll get the same next week. - Is this black money? I made a lot of money. It's not your concern. What do you want in return? Have a guess. Why worry? There will be a legal contract and half a million in your account. This money is our secret. - Is it drugs money? Don't be silly. What am I to tell my accountant and the bank? You should have a new accountant anyway. I've got a very good one for you. He'll tell you about creative invoicing. I'm offering you a way out. Money is freedom. That's my view. So grab your freedom. You're selling shares. We're in business together. Would you rather go bankrupt? We are going to solve your problems. Us together. Your clients deserve top-to-toe treatment in your establishment. While you're recovering from an operation you might as well have your hands done. I know someone with two beauty salons in town. Top locations. You should see them, really. - It's not a bad idea. But I'm not sure it suits me. And I have the ultimate say over what happens in my clinic. Not you. - Of course you decide. But it's nice to do some brainstorming together. Do you really still love your husband? We have a son together. Soon he will no longer be a problem. Why's that? Maugosha can give him the necessary love and attention. You are a burden to each other. You're stifling each other. You're only with him because you think he won't manage on his own. So that's taken care of now. Shall I have my solicitor draw up a contract? What's the matter? I have a premonition. I wanted to warn you. What about? - Maugosha. It may not be what it seems. We may be ruining everything. I'm scared. Sorry, I don't know what you mean. That I'm ruining everything. What are we ruining? Why must we talk about it in the middle of the night? I have to get up at five thirty. As you know. - Never mind then. Forget everything I said. Just go back to sleep. Sleep well. There you are. - Thank you. Kimmy from Kimmy's Beauty Centre. Great that we're going to collaborate. That's a surprise. We have also been thinking about a beauty concept that covers everything. Right? - Yes. Do you know where I met her? At a business fair. She was doing people's nails. So fast, so efficiently. Fantastic. I thought: That's what modern Dutch women need. Beauticians who just do their job well. No chatter, but scrub. In my special field, personal attention is very important. It wasn't meant as an insult. I can see why Jo wants you to be in on it. You have to provide the class. He thinks I'm too... cheap. But he can count on me. As to you, only time will tell. Don't meddle with things that concern only Johan and me. Oh darling, you can't fool me. You hit the sack with him. You're fucking your way up. - Pardon? I think you're wrong. And anyway, you're not allowed to smoke here. They won't say anything about it. Not if Johan is with me. And don't think you can win Johan over. I'm keeping my eye on you. Johan, can I have a word with you? Alone. What's up, darling? I don't think it's such a good idea. With Kimmy, you mean? - I won't do it. I don't see... What won't you do? - I don't really want to work with you. I believe in quality, not quantity. What's quality when the tax office enquires about your black money? Just let me arrange everything and you will be a rich woman. Understood? What if I don't accept? Forgot the contract we signed at the solicitor's? Jesus Christ. Yes? Sorry about just now. Too much wine. - Better stop drinking then. You're right but... They're putting pressure on me, and I took it out on you. I shouldn't do that. Sorry. Who are 'they'? They don't give me time to build it up gradually. They want their money back. The money you gave me, wasn't that yours? The money I lent you? - Invested. No, it's theirs. I only wanted to say: Don't worry. I know exactly how to deal with them. If something strange happens... - What kind of strange? They may come round to your house. Put you under pressure. I'm going to stop with this. Tell them I'm going to pay off my debts. A million with interest? You'll never raise it. But listen, darling. We do this together. I'll keep them at bay. In a few weeks all will be normal again. If anything strange happens I'll ring the police. Ringing the police is a very bad idea. I mean: You're not alone in this. Think of your family as well. Don't worry. I'll phone you soon. We inspected the house without you because Maugosha has to leave. Shall we go through it again quickly? - Yes. I'm not in so much hurry. He said he was going into town with a girl friend. The girl Marije, who came to the reception with her mother. Maybe they'll be an item. The house is looking wonderful. I'm so looking forward to furnishing it again. Maugosha told me you'll call your clinic Tessa's Aesthetics. You don't tell me anything any more. Have you been to bed together? In that case, don't play the victim's part, do me a favour. You'll be saying next that I drove you into her arms. Yes, that's what you did. She sees me, she values me, she listens to me. She does me a world of good. You've no idea how lonely I felt. Have you any idea how I felt? Now what do we do? I don't have to tell you how harmful it is to children. What is? Adultery? Divorce? Both. It must be worse to grow up with parents who are unhappy. Do you want a divorce? I don't know. I have to think. If you think we can survive this I'll stop seeing Maugosha. And we'll stay together. Also for Tom's sake. Mamma, I'm going to die. Mamma... You have one new message. Mamma, I'm going to die. Mamma! Hi, it's Tom. Leave a message after... Jesus Christ. Marije! Your mother said you'd be here. I'm looking for Tom. He never comes here. - Where does he go? He never goes out. He said he was... chilling out with friends. Any idea who? He has no friends. I saw him with a weirdo. In the Squad. What did the man look like? Dirty. With a Russian accent. I had a voice-mail from Tom. He sounded drunk. He doesn't answer now. Wasn't he going into town? So he's not at home yet? He's sixteen. You're bit late with your sense of responsibility. You're not at home either, right? Nearly. - Stop your miserable lying. I was to phone you if something strange happened. You would protect me. If anyone lays finger on Tom... Calm down, what's happened? Tom is gone. He left with one of your Poles. They're not mine, but Maugosha's. Have you tried her? You bastard. Right now she's in bed with my husband. That's what your hired her for. - Finished with your complot theories? I'll make some phone calls. He'll be smoking dope somewhere. Dope? - I'll make sure he gets home, okay? I've got him. Thank God. Pass him on to me. He's asleep and I can't get him to wake up. I'll be there in no time. - No. Take him to First Aid. Isn't that overdoing it? - Take him to First Aid, Goddamit. West End Hospital. I'll be there. Dr Van Asselt? - Has my son been brought in? He's unconscious and on his way. I want you to call Dr den Ouden. He's not on duty. - I want you to ring him. Now. Put him on the stretcher. On his side. Give me your penlight. We'll pump out his stomach. - I'll take him in. Tessa, what's up? - Intoxication. Alcohol to start with. I'll see to him. Johan rang me. Stenjek found him. He was lying in our own garden. But I was there just now. Where is Johan? I had that terrible premonition. He needed me so much. At the disco I talked to a girl and she said that he... ...never went out... ...and that he has no friends. We don't know anything about him. We know absolutely nothing about him. He's out of danger. But he'd ingested a large amount of alcohol and probably GHB. Yes, it was touch and go. Can I see him? - Yes, go ahead. What happened? They found you unconscious. You had drunk too much. Can't remember. I want to sleep. - We'll stay here. Okay? There's no need to worry. All will be well. Hey, where is he? Where is he? Again his voicemail. - I understand in a way. He's ashamed of what happened. Let's simply wait till this evening. We'd better just go to work. - Go to work? What else? - How about looking for him? I wouldn't know where. He's somewhere licking his wounds. How do you know? He's only just been treated, for God's sake. They pumped his stomach out. He could have been dead. All kids experiment with drink and drugs. This kind of thing happens. Tom didn't do this himself. They've made him drunk. Always defending him. - He's not the type, certainly not for GHB. How can you be sure? I know I've made mistakes and overlooked signals... ...but I'm dead sure Tom would never take such drugs. It's the Poles who did it. They fed him alcohol on purpose. You won't believe that of course. You and your mates and your bloody girlfriend. Tom here. Hi, it's Tom. Leave a message after the beep. Tessa van Asselt. - Eug?ne Krijgsman. Call me Eus. Tessa van Asselt. - Martina Solowska. Take a seat. Martina doesn't speak Dutch, so unless you speak Polish, I'll do the talking. You translate for your... girlfriend? Well, I don't speak the language either. We mostly use sign language. We've become very good at that together. Look, Martina's breasts are fine as far as I'm concerned... ...but she would like them a bit larger. You want bigger, yes? And that's why we're here. Because you are the best in the field. I find this rather a difficult situation. You doing the talking. You must think I am here to have Martina re-shaped to my wishes. Martina, you want this, don't you? Yes, I need. Twenty. What does it cost, roughly? - That's not how it works. I must first be absolutely sure that this is what she wants. Better come back with a sworn interpreter. So you decide who gets treated and who doesn't? Are you God or something? If Martina wants me to operate she must convince me first, such are the rules. You know... ...if I take my Porsche to the garage... ...and I tell them I want a Range Rover... ...they don't tell me: You've already got a lovely car. We won't do it. I am not a car dealer. So I won't be able to help you any further. I think we have finished our discussion, Mr Krijgsman. I don't think so. I don't act the boss, I am the boss. He who pays the piper, picks the tune, you see? No, I don't see. So you're even stupider than I thought. Your boyfriend put my money into this establishment. He thinks... ...there's money in this business... ...but if I see how you deal with potential clients... ...I don't believe him. I'm very sorry if I offended you. I just stick to the guidelines to prevent excesses. So... ...you consider us an excess? If you come along with an interpreter... I want my loan back within three months. With interest. That's 50% in the first month, and 100% in the second month, etcetera. Johan called it an investment, not a loan. Didn't you tell him yourself that you'd rather get out of this deal? Didn't you just show me that you're no use as a money-maker? What do you really want from me? I told you... My money back. You know I can't do it so quickly. Yes... you will just have to find a way so that you can. The poor boy... Neglected, because his mum works too hard... ...and his father is exercising his dick. No wonder such kids take to drugs. And yes, well, it can suddenly be too much. Last night was just a foretaste, Madam Doctor. Finishing the job will be no problem at all. What do you want me to do? Bigger breasts for your girlfriend? - For a start. I'll be back this evening, with an interesting proposition. Rogier? He's in danger. Tessa, calm down. I know he is in danger because I'm the one who caused it. Tom just rang me. He phoned me. - And what did he say? He's okay, he's with a friend. No no, they're forcing him to say so, they've got him. And they are blackmailing me. Who are they? The Poles? It's people who want money from me. They all work together. Who is the friend where he is now? He wouldn't tell me. Of course he knows we'd be round there like a shot. What's that strange story about money? Nothing... it's nonsense, never mind. Were are you now? - In the clinic, of course. Would you like me to come and fetch you? No, that's not necessary. I think it's a good thing that Tom is dissociating from us. At last he's showing signs of puberty. Better not ring him. It's better that way. As soon as he rings me, I'll contact you, okay? I recognise myself in you, Tom. I was a loner, too. But you should turn it to your advantage. Being bullied teaches you to exclude your feelings. Always useful later in life. I trained myself to be hard and now it stands me in good stead. There you are. - Great. It's good that you choose for yourself. Gets you peace of mind. Put her at ease. Don't tell her you're here, or I will get the blame. Yes? - Hey, Tommy. Have you talked to Dad yet? Yes, but I just wanted to hear your voice. Where are you? Are you with Stenjek? - Mum... Are they keeping you? Tell me if it's so, just give me a sign. - Mum, pipe down will you? Sorry... How are you feeling? Better than last night. Mum, I'm hanging up. - Wait! Yes? Will you ring me tomorrow, please? If you are in trouble, you can talk to me about it. Yeah, okay. Bye then. So, you've made her happy again. What would you say to a gentle, ice-cold beer? We've got big problems. - We? It's me who's got problems, thanks to you. What are you really doing here? I want to be here before him. To protect you. Protect? Where is Tom? What's up with Tom? Isn't he in hospital? - You know damned well where he is. Good evening. Cheeky little wine. We'd like one too, eh Johan? Certainly. I don't know what the bright idea is... ...but I won't do anything if my son isn't back on the doorstep at nine morning. Look... That's what I like. True mother love. The mother of Sosha... ...would also like her girl in good health back on the doorstep soon, but... ...the chance is very small. Sosha has a deficient liver. She's been waiting for a new liver for ages. Is she a relative of yours? - Does that matter to you? He's been waiting for a new kidney half his life. It doesn't look as if he's going to grow old either. Look Tessa, my girls all want something. New breasts, new buttocks. If you're at it anyway... You don't mean it. You remove the desired organ. What happens to it, is our business. I will never do that, never! I'll never do it. The girls are cooperating of their own free will. It's a chance of a better future for them if they get a reward. Why don't they register as a living donor if they want to save somebody's life? Martina's gone through their screening. They refused her because they doubt her motive. Funny, right? The authorities try to help as few people as possible. So we jump into the gap. - I won't be part of it. Why does she have to wait? Why should she die when there are people willing to donate an organ? This girl can be saved and you're going to do it. I don't even know how to remove part of a liver. Ah... you'll find out easily enough. All you have to do, when you're giving Martina new breasts... ...it is to cut off part of her liver, put it in a cool box and give it to us. We'll make sure it gets to Sosha. And where is Sosha if I may ask? - In a private clinic. Abroad. What makes you think I'm even capable of doing it? I haven't even got the equipment. - Don't lie. You boasted about your operation theatre and how good you are. If the operation succeeds, you'll get fifty thousand per organ. With about thirty of such interventions you'll have repaid your debt. I thought you wanted to see your son again. What do you think his organs would be worth? Your son, dear Tessa, eats out of my hand. He has no idea that he could be dead any minute. My husband is dead. I can't do such an operation on my own. And I couldn't ask my own staff. What do you need? - One assistant at least. We can see to that. - I want Maugosha. Why her? - I know her. She speaks Dutch and Polish. Very important in this case. It will be seen to. Tomorrow evening at ten. Is the operation theatre free, doctor? Believe me. Flee if you can. Good idea. Fried eggs. It's Tessa. It's an emergency. Can you come here and not tell Rogier? I'll be back soon. What's the matter? - I must talk to you about Johan and Eus. You're the only one who can help me. I hope I'm not mistaken about you. My child is in danger and so am I. Please. - Where do we meet? Emma Park playground, do you know that? - Give me half an hour. Thank you. Thanks for coming. - Let's go for a walk. Johan is going to phone you and ask you to assist me at an operation. I asked him to do that. It isn't really true that you can help me, but... ...I wanted to ask you to help me with something against Johan. I don't want to listen any further. - I think... I think it was Johan who killed your husband. Is that true? And I think he also killed Hylke. Johan and Eus want to involve me in a very dirty game. Do you know about it? Say something, Maugosha. - They're always involved in dirty games. It's better not to speak of it. Even if human lives are involved? - Yes. Then too. I'm a doctor, I can't do that. And what they're asking me to do... You'd better do it. It's better to surrender. You got involved with them. You can't back out. They will do what they say. Look at what they did to my husband. Sorry, boss. Why did they kill him? - He had talked to the police. About the girls. - Girls? The girls they put behind a window with a red light. In Poland, life for women is... ...difficult. They all want to leave. I could arrange that with my husband. He worked in Holland with Polish workers. Through me they could become dancers or models. And find a good husband. I didn't know Johan and Eus yet. I found out about the girls when I came to Holland. What about the police? Didn't they come into action after the murder? They are far too clever. They have many people in their power. Mum, open up. Mum! Mum... Oh, darling. Mum, look a this. Here. I found this at Johan's. Oh, my God. We must phone the police. - No, I'll handle this myself. Oh, I'm so happy to see you again. Oh, my angel. Come along. I know it's you. Listen: You've got your son, but that doesn't mean he's safe. If that operation is not successful tomorrow he'll be the first to be done in. When shall I give you another screw? You must be ready for it. Do you have children? That's why. - What do you mean? That's why we must remain silent. For our children. No, Maugosha. It's the reason why we must act. It's different for you, but my Sosha is small and ill. Your Sosha? - A lot of money is needed for her cure. That's why I must do what they tell me. Johan and Eus showed me the photo of your daughter. I'd give anything for her, my life, my soul. In Poland she'd have been... Johan brought her to Germany and said he would have her treated. He's only saying that. But Johan and Eus are putting her life in danger. I don't know if I should tell you. But they are going to use her as a guinea pig. Tomorrow evening I am told to remove part of a girl's liver for her. But that's good news. - No. They have no idea what they're doing. They're not interested in your daughter's life or hers. It could be her death. All they're interested in, is money. We have to stop them. Sosha will live. That's the most important thing. She only stands a chance in the very best hospital, specialised in transplantations. With the liver of a properly screened donor. When this is over, I will take care of her. I swear it on everything that is dear to me. What do I have to do? You have connections. You must have. We need guns and men who can handle them. Gerik and Aleksy. - What about them? They're ex-commandos. Duinhoeve Clinic for Cosmetic Surgery Darling... You must stay in my office this evening. With the door locked. - Why? Don't open to anyone but me. Will Johan be there? - And some others, but they mustn't see you. Why won't you tell me what's happening? - Please don't ask. I'll explain when it's all over, I promise. Come on. You're only to use this in an absolute emergency, okay? Look, here you release it. - I know how they work. Gerik has one. We took shots at tin cans. That's how they do it. Sweetie. The door stays locked, okay? Johan and Eus told me to be here and look over your shoulder. And you phone Johan when he can come and collect this. Are you going to let me in or what? Chic! - I don't need your compliments. I want to mark her breasts so we can start. - You do that. How big? Don't worry. We're getting changed. You'd better wait in the doctor's room. You didn't understand. I am to be there at the operation. I don't advise it. It's quite a bloody procedure. I don't mind. I'm dying to see how it all goes. May I? Thank you. Will you tell her I'm putting her to sleep? Why don't you do the liver first? - I keep the difficult bit to the last. You're pulling a fast one on me. You're not going to do the liver. Don't move. Ouch... You cow! It's me, Tessa. There's a small complication. Kimmy fainted at the sight of blood. Yes, she told me she didn't mind, but... I was to ring you when I'd finished. I've opened up Martina... ...so you'd better be here in half an hour. I'll show you before it goes into the cool box. Okay, see you soon. Are they coming? - They're on their way. Why is it taking so long? - I don't know. It's done. I'll ring the emergency number. - No. I'm going to look first. - Why? We must be sure. Don't move. Finger off the trigger. Your friends never checked whether they did it properly, did they? Where were you trying to go? Oh, because she can't stand blood, you tied her up. Sit down next to her. Is this your plan? Good plan. I wanted to get rid of Eus for ages. Now you and I get all the cash to ourselves. You won't have started on the liver yet? I thought you might want to see how I did it. I want Tom to be there so we can be sure you do it right. Because if it goes wrong, he gets the bullet. Where is that loser? He's not here, he's in a safe place. If you want to save your own life and his, you take me to him. You stay here or you're dead. It was getting too much for me. Especially because it all went so fast. You see? But maybe trade in organs isn't such a bad thing. I'm so sorry. I love you. I love you. How can I make it up again? From now on I'll do anything you want. Tommy. It's me. It's all over. He promised me he'd stay here. I think he's gone to the police. Go immediately. No one must know you were here. Did you really think you could fool me? Yes, there's been a shoot-out. Duinhoeve. Just my son and a patient who's in night-time nursing. Of course I'll stay indoors. Of course. And suddenly we heard those shots. I thought it was fireworks at first. - It's such a remote spot. I sometimes see cars in the night. I've no idea what they're up to. It's a scary thought, right in front of my door. I've reported it to the police sometimes, but... I've never seen them patrol here. I can ask my men to help you. - That's not necessary. I'll do it together with Tom. I... - It's... It's all right like this. Where are Gerik and Aleksy? Where they belong, with their women. The police will never find them. This is for them. And this is for you. He's the best transplantation specialist in Europe and he has donor for Sosha. Thank you. The Investigation Department has been round six times. They did their best, but they never found anything. A gangland murder, the police call it. They didn't get any further. Nobody knows our secret. We were very clever, my mother and I.
