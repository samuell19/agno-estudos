IT HAPPENED ON JULY 20TH That's how July 20, 1944 began. It seemed a day like any other. Bombs by night. The inferno of total war. But today brave men would try to end the terror and save what was left of Germany's honor. Gentlemen, the new government has been formed. The old unions will take over the factories. The rest is up to you and the army, General. We've occupied key positions. We can strike like lightning from there. Success depends on convincing the officers. And their oath to Hitler? - Once he's dead, the oath is void. - If he doesn't get away again. The three failed coups cost precious time. Peace is still possible. The enemy's not in Germany yet. But for how long? It all depends on the terms the Allies offer. If they continue to insist on unconditional surrender... Professor! Finally! Come with me. - Couldn't come sooner. - Any news? Yes. They insist on unconditional surrender even if Hitler's dead. Then we may as well forget about the whole thing. - Ask Germany to commit suicide? - It's so near-sighted of them! America should know... if the East invades Germany Europe is lost. Getting rid of Hitler this way invites future disaster. We're willing to make sacrifices, but for what? Our own fate and Allied peace terms are of secondary importance. What matters is that mass murder... is being committed in the name of the German people. It is our duty to stop this by all means. Neither God nor conscience can absolve us from this duty. You're impatient, Stauffenberg. I'm not impatient, but this last hour... I've waited for this moment ever since I resigned in 1938. At the time, I still hoped this protest could avert the war. More coffee? Yes, please. It's going to be hot today. We've gone over it many times. Thousands like us have sat thinking in darkened rooms. Deliberating on how to avert disaster. Millions are counting on us... Waiting for you to act, Stauffenberg. It is our plan, even if I carry it out. If it fails this time, the German people are doomed. - All would be in vain. - No! Even if we only show the way. Others might follow our lead. What we are doing, what we must do... is actually an act of penitence. I was never as sure of that as today. Time to get ready, Claus. - What time is it? - 6:30. Car's coming at 7:00. Stauffenberg, not only are we in your hands, but the whole German nation. This Stauffenberg, will he stay when the bomb goes off? No. We can't afford to lose him. No one can take his place. Not there, and not in Berlin. I was very clear to him about that. He must return. Dare we act before we know for sure if the attempt was successful? When to carry out the plan is no longer our decision. Leber has been arrested. Goerdeler's hiding from the Gestapo in Potsdam. We might be discovered any day, any hour even. Success today will put a quick end to the senseless bloodshed. We'll be saving not only Germany, but all of Europe. That's worth even the greatest risk. You're right. We mustn't hesitate any longer. I've been thinking of Halder. He said a military setback was crucial. Otherwise the masses won't support an uprising. We've certainly had severe setbacks every day now. Waiting longer would make our position untenable in cease-fire negotiations. By the way, do you think Fromm will join us? I doubt it. We can't let him command the replacement training army. H?pner will have to. He's meeting Olbricht soon. - Olbricht's a good man. - He's 100% reliable. - Will you wear a uniform? - No. I don't want the new state to have a military cast. I absolutely agree. Who actually procured the bomb? It was Stieff. An English model. Salvaged. - Will it work for sure? - Yes. Has an acid release timer. Not accurate to the second. But quiet and absolutely reliable. Here. I had the handles covered in rubber. For a good grip. Thanks, Berthold. Isn't that a bit reckless? Only ten minutes? Is that enough time? I know the place perfectly. Ten minutes is plenty. Here's Keitel's post, and the SS guard around the F?hrer's bunker. Two minutes for the walk, one for the check, one to the bunker. That's exactly four minutes. And three for the way back is seven. So what? Leaves three to get rid of the stuff. You forget 30 seconds to activate the fuse. And 15 for the car to start. So you have two minutes. Two minutes can be a long time. At least take my stopwatch with you. So you can check the time. Claus, I ... Berthold, don't... Understand that I worry. You're my brother. And you're needed in Bendlerstrasse. If you don't get out, we're lost. I'll make it... God willing. - Good morning, Frieder. - Good morning. Otto, what is it? Breakfast is ready. - Mother, did you see that man? - No, who? There was a man in the church. An officer with an eyepatch. A face I'll never forget. He has an account to settle with God. Don't talk, Otto. Come to breakfast. No, no, Mother. There was something strange about it. He had some kind of problem... There's no other solution. Innocent people may have to die so that millions can live. We can be back by 16:00. Coronel, the plane to Rastenburg is waiting. - I'll take you. - Thanks. AW 172 to East Prussia. AW 172 to East Prussia. Courier to F?hrer's headquarters. Reporting AW 172. Destination airport Rastenburg. Reporting takeoff at 7:02. Over and out. Stauffenberg's is not the first attempt on Hilter's life. But a strange chain of circumstances has saved the dictator time and again. - Good to see you, H?pner. - 9:00 and already so hot. What a day we wait... What about Moss and the armor school? Moss will make sure the tanks roll. Good. Everything's arranged with Hase, too. We can rely on the guard regiment and the city garrison units 100%. I have to leave for Bendlerstrasse. Excuse me. I need to talk to my wife. Eva! Maybe you can allay her fears. She thinks she'll never see me again. Sure I can. When shall I be at Bendlerstrasse? - When you wish, come with us. - No, I prefer to go by train. You had better not be seen with a disgraced general today. - Good morning, Mr. H?pner. - Good morning, Mrs. Eva. Your suitcase is ready. Right there. Thank you very much. When will you be back? Shall we go out for dinner? I can't say yet, dear. I'll call you before tonight. Shall I have it ironed? Thank you, Eva. It's not a parade. I understand your bitterness. The reason you took off the uniform was honorable. And when you wear it today it will be like old times. Robinson, ask if the plane is needed after Berchtesgaden. Yes! - Is AW 172 from Berlin here? - Just landed, Captain. Hello. Stauffenberg wants his plane ready for the return flight at 12:45. - He's expected back in Berlin. - No problem. - Steffen, take care of that. - Yes, sir. The Wolfsschanze sent a car for you. Yes, the driver just reported for duty. - We've been announced. I believe. - Yes, Colonel, we got the message. Car can go through. Passenger vehicle WH 49 A 15... carrying Count Stauffenberg and von Haeften. Passed outer gates at 11:07. Over and out. Identification, please. Thank you, Colonel. 11:13, Colonel Stauffenberg and First Lieutenant von Haeften. - Wait till I'm back. - Wait till the Colonel is back. Count Stauffenberg, General. I'll talk to him outside. HEAD OF INFORMATION SERVICE GENERAL FELLGIEBEL - Hello, Stauffenberg. - What's new, General? - M?llendorf! Greetings. - Haeften! How's Berlin? There's extra iron in the air. Moreover, as hot as here. Great weather, isn't it? Must be specially in Mussolini's honor. We're expecting him at 15:00. on the special train. There's a big to-do in his honor. Olbricht will launch Valkyrie when you call. Yes, it's important to act immediately. Use the initial confusion. - Going back to Berlin today? - Hope so. As long as no one ruins our plan. How long can you block communication? Depends on the situation. But two hours for sure. If he dies, I might finish it off completely. The message center can be blown up, but... We have to wait and see what happens. - General, your connecion! - Coming! Well... Good luck. You, too. You can do me a favor. Breitsprech made me some boots. Exception for an old customer. - They're finished. - I'll bring them along next time. M?llendorf, is the beer all gone? - No, a new batch came in. - Let's get some. - We could use a drink. Haeften? - I agree. - May I give you a hand. - No thanks, I can manage. Got the list of who receives a copy, Kerzen? All here, General. Special orders, too. Shall we say that radical SS factions are trying to seize power? So they don't question fighting the party and the SS. Beck will say whatever necessary on the radio. - Who'll occupy the radio? - Cadets from D?beritz. - Who's the commander? - Hitzfeld. Good man. I was just in D?beritz on Saturday. 12:20. Stauffenberg must be with Keitel right now. Field Marshall, Colonel Stauffenberg. Tell him to come in. At your command, Field Marshall. How are the interception units shaping up? Personnel is no problem, but we're poorly equipped. The F?hrer explicitly ordered they be ready for action. We only have vehicles for 60% of troops. May I show you the documents? I beg one thing of you, Stauffenberg. Don't paint things too pessimistically to the F?hrer. The Duce's coming. It's crucial that we humor the F?hrer. Time for the briefing. It's now 12:27. Come, Stauffenberg. What's keeping you? We're waiting. Coming. - I forgot my briefcase. - May I? - No, thank you. I'm fine. - Excuse me. What is it? Gentlemen! It's 12:30. We can't keep the F?hrer waiting. - He forgot his briefcase. - Hurry up. Where are you going? Not to the bunker? No, the conference barracks. The bunker's being repaired. One moment, please. I'm expacting a call from Berlin. - Get me when it comes in. - Yes, sir. Troops of the 3rd and 17th Siberian armies... have managed to advance across the Duna River. What's been done about it? I demand that it be taken care of. That's an order. - Continue. - F?hrer, Stauffenberg will brief us. - On interception units. - Thank you. You're next, Stauffenberg. Continue, please. The Northern Group of Armies suggests... that we withdraw troops in vulnerable positions. We should form new lines of defense in this area. The troops withdrawn from Yugoslavia can't be desployed for five more days. Our defenses here are already fairly good. 50 km of trenches per division. Trenches held by German soldiers. By German soldiers, General. Please remember that. Continue. I have to call Berlin. I'll leave my briefcase here. No call from Berlin yet, Colonel. - All right. I'll be right back. - Yes, Colonel. No, the other map, No. 156. - Where's Stauffenberg? - Making a phone call. Go! Get General Olbricht in Berlin for me. Right away, sir. It's Berlin. Hello, Berlin? Olbricht? Where? Tell him: operation completed. I'm cutting all communications. Hello! Hello! I can't hear you. Please repeat. Cut off all communication lines and give the command... - to all telegraph stations. - What reason shall I give? Say something terrible happened. Assassination attempt on the F?hrer. Block everything. Hello! Say something. Hello! What's this? Was that Wolfsschanze? Couldn't hear. Very bad connection. Hello? Operator? Get me F?hrungsblitz Wolfsschanze. There's no answer. - Keep trying. - Was that Fellgiebel? Possibly. That will be all. What? You can't get through? But I must speak to Fellgiebel. - Try corps headquaters in K?nigsberg. - What's the code word? No idea. I can't get through now. That can only mean Stauffenberg must have been successful. Let's launch Valkyrie immediately! If it's a false alarm like last week... and I launch Valkyrie again in vain our last chance is gone. I must know what's going on. Olbricht! Yes. Keep trying. I'm waiting. No answer from Wolfsschanze. Sorry, we can't let you pass. - May I use your phone? - Yes, Colonel. - The camp commander's number? - 017, sir. General Stauffenberg... the guard won't let me pass. You know I'm under orders from the F?hrer. Yes. Thank you, General, sir. - You heard it. I can pass. - Yes, sir. The car can go through. No vehicles allowed through, Colonel. - But security just let me through. - I have my orders, Colonel. - Come with me. - Yes, Colonel. - The camp commander's number? - 017, Colonel. M?llendorf? Here's Stauffenberg. The guard won't let me through. I'm in a hurry. I'll hand you over so you can tell him yourself. - Guard Post No. 1. - Let Stauffenberg pass. - Over. - Yes, Captain. Your weapons, Colonel. Go ahead, Colonel. Lift the barrier! Vehicle can go through. He must have been hit. Absolutely. Such a heavy detonation. Berlin must have sounded the alarm. That one-eyed colonel left just before it went off. - Colonel Stauffenberg? - Yes. He said there would be a call from Berlin but he didn't wait for a connection. Report that immediately. The guy's joined the Reds for sure. Damned quiet here. Valkyrie should be in progress. The car isn't here, either. - Can I make a call? - Follow me, Colonel. In the meantine, I'll get us a car. Go ahead, Colonel. - Can I have some privacy? - Of course, Colonel. General Olbricht, quick. Stauffenberg reporting back. All's well. I'm absolutely sure. What? You didn't launch it? That means we lost three hours! We had no reliable information. No, there was no call from Fellgiebel. Of course. We'll launch it right away. Gentlemen, the time has come. Hitler is dead. We finally did it. Now we can get started. You know what's on the line. We're a handful against hundreds. Our firm belief in a good cause must outweigh our small number. Then we'll convince the others. God help us. Kersten, launch Valkyrie. Issue special orders. Make sure Colonel General Beck is picked up. Ollendorf, you take care of the assault troops. You relay orders to acting corps headquarters. Schulenburg, you phone the orders through to save time. You have the orders sent per teletype to acting corps headquarters. Yes, sir. What happened? You don't seem happy we've finally achieved our goal. I think of all who lived for this day and who are no longer with us. Valkyrie was the code word... for the mobilization of troops... to suppress civil unrest. Send this by teletype. You reserved three, right? But it doesn't say "urgent". - Ask Major Kersten, then. - Yes, Captain. Yes, Major. Over and out. - Where's the LDN? - Yes? There are special orders for Valkyrie. Secret and top priority. Gerstig, come here for a minute. "Occupy all Party, SS security service and Gestapo offices." "Arrest all Nazi leaders down to the county level." "Lock up all concentration camp guards." "Prisoners are to await further orders." Seems to be a lot going on. - Who signed the special order? - Von Witzleben and Stauffenberg. But General Witzleben hasn't worn a uniform in years. We do whatever they say. Heil! Yes, Lieutenant. - Lieutenant Schulipp? - Sir. - Occupy the palace. - And secure bridges of the Spree. - Yes, General. - Schulipp? - Yes, Sir. - Cover the telegraph office. - Your base is the arsenal. - At your command. - Major Remer. - General. - Send guards... to Bendlerstrasse immediately. Block off the Government Quarter, Brandenburg Gate, Potsdamer Platz. and Prinz-Albrecht Strasse. Disarm Waffen-SS and Leibstandarten. Nobody goes through. No minister, no general. Yes, sir. Set up your command post here at garrison command. When everything is ready, arrest Goebbels. If he's not in the ministry, you'll find him at home. Excuse me, General. Explain the situation, please. You understood me, Major Remer. I expect your report by 18:00. Thank you, gentlemen. If I may say something, General, shouldn't Remer have been informed? I think it's better if he knows nothing. Alarm! Nuremberg, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Vienna are informed. Thank you, Kersten. I should go see Fromm. Might be no news for a while. Shouldn't you wait for Stauffenberg? No. Fromm will know any minute Valkyrie is on. Yes? Excuse me. How many tickets do you want reserved for tonight? What tickets? For the film. The National Socialist convention. Tell the propaganda officer he can kiss my ass. Oh, pardon me. It's possible to equip a unit with SFA 14F. Yes? What is it, Olbricht? - I need to speak with you privately. - It's so urgent? Please wait a minute outside. Well? General, we just got word. Wolfsschanze reports... the F?hrer has been assassinated. - Who told you that? - Fellgiebel himself. I suggest we launch Valkyrie immediately. First I have to be absolutely sure. Speak to Field Marshal Keitel then. F?hrungsblitz Wolfsschanze, Field Marshal Keitel, please. I'll wait. I doubt you'll get through. Why? There's no way I can order a state of siege on my own initiative. Yes, Fromm here. Field Marshal? What's going on at headquarters? Wild rumors abound in Berlin. I was just told the F?hrer has been assassinated. So he hasn't. No, no. There was an attempt on his life but the F?hrer isn't hurt. Ask him where Stauffenberg is. By the way, where is Count Stauffenberg? I see, you don't know. No, that's all for now. Over and out. - You really think Stauffenberg...? - Who else? We've made arrangements. - Not your job. - Protecting him? What do you mean by that? How dare you! Then leave him to me. May I? Get me the main office, Reich Security. No, Berlin. It's urgent. If Keitel's right, we must halt Valkyrie. - Impossible! - We won't stop it now, it's underway. - Just consider... - It's too late! Stay calm! Stauffenberg said it was successful. With absolute certainty! General Stauffenberg's coming! - Gentlemen, what's going on? - Is Hitler dead? I saw the flames myself... I'm absolutely sure. He must be dead. Fromm just talked to them. Wolfsschanze says he us unharmed. A lie. They want to gain time. Our plan must be executed before the lie spreads. Whatever, the die has been cast. There's no way back. Fromm has to decide. There aren't enough new assault rifles for the new divisions. We'll have to use salvaged French and Czech guns. - Is there enough ammunition? - Just for initial issue. Reporting back. I must speak to you, General. On the same matter? Gentlemen, if you don't mind. What is there to say? Hitler's dead. I was there. The situation was so clear that we already launched Valkyrie. You did what? And who is "we"? Who gave the order? My chief of staff, Colonel Kersten von Durnstein. Go get Kersten now! Kersten! - General. - You ordered Valkyrie? - Yes, General. - Without my approval? You're under arrest. We'll proceed from there. General, I set off the bomb myself. I placed it directly next to Hitler. There's no way he can have survived. Stauffenberg, the plot has failed. You will shoot yourself immediately. I will do nothing of the kind. It's time to act. If we don't act now, the German nation is doomed. You're involved in this coup? It's not a coup. It's our last chance... to save Germany. You know that, too. I'll have you three arrested. You misread the situation. - We will arrest you instead! - You've gone crazy! You'll deal with the consequences. Take the fourth General away. He's under arrest! It's a shame you're not on our side, Fromm. You're making a dangerous mistake, H?pner. Hitler is alive! I can't go along with this. Guard battalion on duty as ordered. Officers come to me. Company... Halt! At ease! My base is Garrison Command. Unter den Linden Boulevard. - Any questions? - No, sir. All right, then. Than you, gentlemen. Get in the trucks. It's 19:11. If I'm not back by 19:30, storm the place and get me out. Let's go! First squad to the right. Second to the left. March. Major Remer. What...? What brings you to me? I assume you've come to brief me on the situation. I have orders to arrest you. Yes, the F?hrer himself. You can talk to him yourself. Goebbels wants a direct line to the F?hrer. - Do you hear my voice, Remer? - Yes, F?hrer. - Convinced it's me? - Yes, F?hrer. Don't lose time, be brutal if needed. Yes, my F?hrer. I'm counting on you, Remer. Heil! Heil, my F?hrer! If they don't know what they want, how are we supposed to? What's the matter now? We're to assemble in Goebbels' yard. - And who'll be on guard here? - It's not our problem. - Lend me your knife. - Hurry. Four men waiting to see Olbricht already. Just a minute... The Thousand Year Reich will be over in a minute. Heil Hitler! I'm looking for General Stauffenberg. - Sorry? Looking for Stauffenberg? - Yes. Please come with me. Hands up! Oh. Now I understand. Who alarmed the guard battalion? They're marching on Valkyrie orders. Valkyrie? I must speak to Fromm. What's going on here? Where's Fromm? I'll have to do, I've taken his place. - On whose orders? - Colonel General Beck. I refuse to follow your orders, Herr H?pner. Be sensible, they're on the way. This is... It's treason! Is it treason to believe in a better Germany? You want to watch it go to the dogs? See our honor besmirched? The honor of all Germany? Stopping that is treason in your eyes? Is that treason? I swore an oath and I'll keep it. An oath? To whom? To a man who has broken his oath a hundred times over! Or did he keep to his oath on the constitution? Has he been faithful to what he swore? - Any further discussion is pointless. - I agree! Hand over your pistol, please. The state of emergency is lifted. Special orders are canceled. This applies to all orders signed by Witzleben, Fromm, and H?pner. Issue counter-orders immediately. Himmler wants to know what's going on in the Bendlerstrasse. I can't reach either Fromm or Olbricht. What's your plan? Wait till they call YOU? Not in that tone! Why hasn't Goebbels issued a denial? Hitler has to speak over the radio. Let us worry about that. A recording unit is on the way already. Look at this. All orders by Witzleben, Fromm, and H?pner are canceled. Signed Field Marshal Keitel. Chief, Wehrmacht High Command. We're caught in the middle... The contents aren't our concern. It's our duty to relay all orders. Here are Witzleben and Stauffenberg. Here's Keitel. But only one side can be right. Till we know which is, we relay both. Let them talk. Never mind the counter-orders. Keitel's a pushover. We must pre-empt Himmler and the SS. Every hour counts. Thank you. This is Stauffenberg. Haueisen! No! Only our orders are valid. Only orders signed by us. Tell your boss. Don't disappoint me, Haueisen. Colonel, I have Paris on the line next door. I'm counting on you, Haueisen. Over. Why haven't the D?beritz cadets occupied the radio stations? General Hitzfeld's not in. We're trying Colonel M?ller. So make sure to use pressure. - Heaften, see to it we get the radio. - Yes, General, sir. H?pner speaking. Just a moment. General Kienzel refuses... - to call back the exposed forces. - Is that him? - Yes, from his fighting position. - Give him to me. Beck speaking. Why haven't you retreated? You said you can't hold your position. Retreat behind the Danube with all troops. - What about Paris? - All set. His death isn't confirmed yet. But death is certain for thousands if you don't retreat. I beg you, Kienzel. I beseech you. You must do it. Don't hesitate for a minute. Over. - What does he say? - He's still undecided. It's going well in Paris. St?lpnagel's in charge. This is the German Radio Network. Pay Attention! Important news from the F?hrer's headsquarters. This afternoon there was an attempt to assassinate the F?hrer. The assassins failed. The F?hrer was not injured. He will address the nation tonight on the network. So we don't have the radio. That's Goebbels' work. Damn it! How is that possible? Remer was supposed to arrest him. Schmitt-Thiel, send a reliable officer. He's to assemble a patrol and arrest Goebbels immediately. - Haeften? - Yes, sir? Bring these to the message center. FRR to all military commanders. That they may pass all the plants. I want all these streets blocked off. - Rockwitzer Allee. - Yes. - Warschauer Allee. - Yes Also mobilize 6% of Infantry Battalion. Till now we could play dumb. But now it's on the radio. We must follow our conscience. Let's say our convictions. Sounds better. You have to make the decisions now. I'm not sticking my neck out. Send this out: Stop all orders by Stauffenberg, H?pner, Beck, and Olbricht. Relay orders from Wolfsschanze only. And the phone? Attention teletype operators: All orders signed by... - These orders go out right away. - Right away, sir. What's this damn racket? Can't hear myself think. And if they discover we're not sending anything out? - Wolfsschanze is far away. - Shot or promoted, that's the question. But I'm betting Hitler shoots faster. Mayerhofer, double sentries at all entrances. Wendland, you get some machine guns. Nobody gets in here except those bringing orders. At your command, Lieutenant. Olbricht wants weapons to defend Bendlerstrasse. Against whom? Who are we fighting? I say Olbricht has led us astray. Let's ask him what's going on here. We'll hang if we don't take a stand. A court-martial won't buy: "Our heart was with the F?hrer." Comrades, no more hesitating. This is an attack on our F?hrer. Stop! New orders from the tank inspectorate. Valkyrie obsolete. Unit returns to barracks. Await further orders. Hitler has appointed Himmler head of the Replacement Army. He has been empowered to take whatever steps are necessary. Anything new? Himmler's head of the Home Army. Well, now we know where we stand. Lieutenant! Lieutenant. - This just came in, Major. - Thank you. Lieutenant Rohr, the F?hrer has promoted you to captain. - You're Pelke? - Yes, Major. The F?hrer has promoted you to lieutenant. So. Would you do me the same favor? - That would be very kind. - Maybe Triba can... I'm in a huge rush. I have to see the ordnance officer. Well, Frenzen? Unfortunately, I was not successful. I couldn't muster troops to arrest Goebbels. Remer defected to the other side. His command post is in Goebbels' villa. And the tanks? Turned around. They're assembling at Fehrbelliner Platz. That means Himmler is marching on Berlin with the SS. Our backs are against the wall. We have no choice. We have to make it work somehow. Colonel... You can go home, son. I don't need you here anymore. I ask to be allowed to remain with you, Sir. This message is for Colonel Wolf in M?nster. Be careful. Don't get into any trouble. - Please, Colonel. - That's an order. Yes, Colonel, sir. Good luck. My sitting around here is no use. I want to go home and sleep. If you're worried I'll make phone calls, I give you my word I won't do a thing. Please accompany the gentleman to his apartment. Colonel M?ller of the infantry school. NOW you come. D?beritz Infantry school ready for action. It's 22:50. Sorry, I was on an inspection tour. And General Hitzfeld went to a funeral. A funeral. You may be just in time for a funeral here. I don't understand, sir. The cadets will shield Bendlerstrasse. Yes, General, sir. What's going on out there? Haffner, look to see. - Haeften, check what's going on. - Yes, sir. We won't march against the F?hrer. We're not stupid. For or against the F?hrer? Heil Hitler! Overall, you've misled us. We want to know who we're fighting. Clear positions! You've abused our loyalty as soldiers. Where's general Fromm? We want to see him. You're armed, we're not. You can see Fromm, but first... Just a moment, madam. You wife, General. Eva? There's no need to worry. No. We just have to wait and see. I can't talk now, maybe I'll call later. So. Good-bye. Good-bye. So what's up with General Fromm? This is the last time I'm asking. Stop or I'll shoot! You're holding Fromm hostage! Release him immediately! Put that gun down first. I don't take orders from you. So where is General Fromm? He's upstairs in his apartment, if you want your... Well, gentlemen. Now you'll get the same treatment I got from you this afternoon. Werner, don't. It's over. Lay down your weapons. You're under arrest. Don't do this to me, your former superior. There's only one thing for me to do. I'll do it myself. Give me your pistol. I remember how it used to be. We don't want to discuss that now. - I ask that you act. - It was different then. Soldiers didn't follow orders blindly. They heeded their consciences too. And you, gentlemen... If there's anything you want to write, you don't have much time left. There's so much I'd like to write but there's no time left. In a few minutes, they'll come to take me away. But I want you to know I am absolutely calm. Everything small sink ends. Everything unimportant is fading away. The struggle is over. Now I will rest. Your love, that has surrounded me all my life.... Gentlemen. Are you ready? Please make haste, Olbricht. The waiting is hard on the others. I'm sorry, H?pner. I can only give you a choice between two options. Prison while you await trial, or... Thank you, Fromm. There are some things I want to say. Not to you... but to the court and to those whose judgment of me matters. Fine. As you wish. Take the gentleman away. The court-martial I have convened... has sentenced the following officers to death: Infantry General Olbricht... Colonel Kersten von D?renstein... this colonel, whose name I have forgotten... and this first lieutenant. The death sentence will be carried out immediately. Place your trust in God. In a few minutes, we'll know more about Him than you do. Column... right! Forward... march! Squad... halt! Left... face! Order... arms! Light! We need more light. Pull the truck up! In the F?hrer's name: Get ready! Release the safety! Long live sacred Germany. Fire! They were but the first four victims of July 20, 1944. Hitler, in blind hatred, ordered the executions of thousands more. And the war continued. Millions of men, women, and children would still lose their lives. Now it's up to us to ensure they did not give their lives in vain.
