Jeremy! I feel that. Garland, Grace. Two tours in Afghanistan with the Third Marine Expeditionary Force. Silver Star. Soldier's Medal. I'm guessing the Marines are sorry to see you go. Thanks. I'm gonna miss them, too. Welcome home, Captain, and merry Christmas. Hey. Where'd you come from? Hi, you. Okay. I'm okay. Hi... I'm terribly sorry to bother you, but I have been in an accident. My car has just... Hold on. You're bleeding. Please, come inside out of the cold. Let's make sure you're okay. - I hope you like earl Grey. - Sure. Okay. Let's take a look here. It doesn't look too bad. Some antibiotic cream should do the trick. So, something went wrong with your car? There was this terrible noise and then tons of smoke. I tried to stop, but I must have hit some ice. Where's your car now? It's stuck in a snowbank at the edge of your field. How's your neck and shoulders? Any whiplash? No. I'm fine. Any blurred vision? How many fingers do I have up? Three, I think, or else you really are a Boy Scout. So, this dog appeared out of nowhere and it felt like it was trying to help me. - I followed it back to your farm. - You followed it here? Yeah. She ran around the back of your house. - White with a brown patch? - Over one eye? There you are. There's my good girl. - What's her name? - Justice. That's a good name. Yeah. You're just about perfect, Justice. Are you a vet? No. I mean, yes. I'm a veteran, but I'm not a veterinarian. I work with dogs, though, or I did. I was explosive detection and search and rescue for a K9 unit in Afghanistan. Are you home on leave for the holidays? No. Honourable discharge. So, I'm out. But... I have to admit, the thought of the holidays makes my heart ache a little. Why's that? The Marines needed to keep my dog. Good dogs are hard to come by and, boy, mine was the best. What does that have to do with the holidays? My dog's name's Christmas. So, now everything from candy canes to reindeer remind me of him. Look at that. She likes you. - Do you think so? - I do, and Justice is a great judge of character. Yeah. - I'm so sorry about your fence. - I am really sorry about your car. Just bought it 48 hours ago. - You're kidding. - Nope. Well, if it's any consolation, my uncle owns the best auto repair shop in town. Come to think of it, it's the only repair shop in town. - Seriously, he's very good. - Okay. Well, Grace, I've seen less trouble. But, then again, I've seen a whole lot worse. Your engine blew a connecting rod and that requires a major teardown and I'm going to have to replace the cylinder head. That sounds terrible. Well, now, the transmission was not affected. That's good news. Of course, when you went into the ditch, you damaged the lower control arm on the passenger side and I'm going to have to replace the shock absorber. But once that's done, you just need a front end alignment and she'll be good as new. How long will all this take? Well, it might not be this year, but lucky for you, next year's only three weeks away. Three weeks? What am I gonna do? I can't stay here. I'm sorry, it's a busy time of year. I might be waiting a week just for your parts. - You got family expecting you? - No, it's just me. I mean, I have an older brother, but he's a commercial fisherman in Alaska. I guess you got plans for the holidays. Well, no, not really. I have a job waiting for me in Cincinnati that starts in February. Then I tell you what, you could do a whole lot worse than being stuck here. Rivers Crossing at Christmas is pretty special. And having said that, I will put a rush on your parts and make sure you're in Cincinnati by Christmas. Thank you. Appreciate it. Grace, I have a comfortable cottage out back of my house. You're welcome to stay there for the time being. Sure beats the motel on the highway. I couldn't possibly impose. No. It's no problem at all, really. I'd be happy to help. I don't know. If you'd like, just come back and check it out, then decide. Okay. Thank you. Thanks, Uncle Roy. - You got it. - Thank you. - It's so cute. Thanks. - I'm glad you like it. Here it is, your home away from home. What is all this? I don't get too many guests, so I, turned it into my version of a man cave. - Are you a lawyer? - Judge. I'm the municipal judge here in Rivers Crossing. - You're the town judge. - Guilty as charged. My mom likes to joke that, as a baby, my first word was "jurisprudence". Here I thought you were a farmer. That's me, sowing the seeds of justice. Anyway, despite the pointy-headed decor, I really do hope that you find it comfortable here. And I always leave the back door to the house open, so help yourself to anything in the fridge. Thank you. Really, it's very generous. - Please, make yourself at home. - I will. Well, goodnight, sleep well. I wouldn't worry, Your Honour. If I suffer from insomnia, I can always crack open one of those law books. Right. Tomorrow's Sunday. I'm wondering if maybe you'd like to join me for church in the morning. Since you're gonna be stuck here for awhile, it might be a great opportunity for you to meet some folks, get a feel for the town. That's really kind of you, but I don't have anything appropriate to wear. - But thank you anyway. - No problem. I'll be right back with your bags. Joe, I'm just curious about the Santa suit. 'Tis the season. Ho, ho, ho. Morning. Good morning. - Sleep OK? - I did, yeah. Yes. How do you like your coffee? Cream or a little milk, whatever you have. My sister called this morning, and I hope I wasn't being too presumptuous, but I asked her... Joey! Hi. You must be Grace. - I'm Katie, Joe's little sister. - Hi. I am so sorry to hear about your accident. But don't worry, you are in good hands with Uncle Roy. And Joe tells me you were in the Marines? That is so interesting. I can't wait to hear all about that. And thank you for your service, really. Of course. These are for you for church. Hmm? What luck. Looks like we're almost the same size. Came prepared. Come on. This'll be so much fun. Did I mention that I own the hair salon in town? After all that time in Afghanistan, you deserve some pampering. What do you say? Breakfast? Me too. I don't know why, but my sister never looked that good in that dress. I love you too, Joe. You can now officially lower expectations for your Christmas gift this year. It's getting late. I've got to run. Thank you again, Katie, so much. It's been awhile since I got dressed up and it feels really good. Well, you look amazing. So great to meet you, Grace. I'm super happy you'll be in Rivers Crossing for awhile. That lipstick colour is perfect for you. See you in church. And don't let Joe be late. Mom hates that. Bye. - Thank you. - More than welcome. - Hey, she's lovely. - Yeah. Hey, Aunt Nellie, aren't you supposed to be in church? Is that my Joey? The good Lord will have to wait. I have too much to do and too little time to do it. Hello. I don't believe we've met. Sorry. Aunt Nellie, this is Grace Garland. Grace, this is my favourite aunt, Aunt Nellie. Don't listen to him. I'm his only aunt He had to like me. - Nice to meet you. - Pleasure is all mine. So, what are you doing out here with measuring tape? I tossed and turned all night because the Christmas committee ordered new ornaments and I was worried sick that they wouldn't be the right size. - And what have you determined? - They're perfect. Break out the eggnog. Christmas is saved. You be good or you'll get a lump of coal in your stocking. Hey, I'm good. I'm good. You know, those ornaments should have been here two weeks ago. And don't forget about Wednesday. Remember, you volunteered to help finish decorating the town? - I will be there with bells on. - You're invited, too. Practically the whole town pitches in. It'll be so much fun. They'll be hot cocoa and cookies. There's nothing like Christmas in Rivers Crossing. That's what I've heard. But I don't think I'll be here through Christmas. I'm just waiting for my car to get fixed. Your car? Something's wrong with your car? Well, that's a long story, Aunt Nellie, and we should get going. I don't want to be late for church, you either. See you later. - Bye. - Bye. Be careful where you're going now. Scoot down. Grace, this is my mom Fran, niece Addy, nephew Tyler, you know their mom Katie, Uncle Roy you've met, and there's Aunt Nellie. Everyone, this is Grace. Good morning, folks. I am so happy to see all of your smiling faces on this blessed day. Please stand and open your hymnals to page 315. Don't look now, dear, but I think your friend might need some rescuing. They found out she's single, she's a vet and she's staying in your guesthouse. It's a perfect storm. - Oh, boy. - Yeah. Thanks, Mom. Joe, can you help me unload the car? I have some food and clothing for the charity drive. I need to get it into the vestibule. Yeah. Just a minute. I'll be right back. Okay. The choir practices for weeks in advance. It's a very special Christmas Eve service. Say, you wouldn't be a soprano, would you? 'Cause we could really... Excuse me, Reverend. Can I borrow Grace for a moment? Of course, Joe. That's quite the impressive young woman you found there, Joe. I'm sorry about the small town inquisition. It's okay. Everyone's really nice. I just... I'm not sure I'm ready for so much civilian life all at once. I can imagine. Listen, I've gotta help my mom with some stuff here. Do you want to just take the Scout back to the farm? I can catch a ride back with her, and I'm sure Justice will be very happy to see you. I'll be happier to see her. Why don't you slip out the side door there and I'll provide you a cover? - You'll thank everyone for me? - Done. Are you aware of the deep concern in this parish over your marital status? Don't you have someplace to be? Thanks again. Morning. Good morning, Officer. Is there a problem? Are you aware you were travelling 35 in a 25 mile an hour zone? May I see some identification, please? Could you take your driver's licence out, please? You mind telling me why it is you're racing the judge's truck through town? Well, maybe because Joe was kind enough to lend me his car. And why would he do that? Because I'm stuck in this town and I'm staying with him until my car gets fixed. You're staying at the judge's house? - In his guest house. - Is that right? Everything all right, Sheriff? Nothing I can't handle, Judge. You missed a good sermon this morning, Cooper. Hi, Mrs. Peterson. I think I caught it earlier. I was at the seven a.m. service. - It was "Christmas comes once a year". - That's the one. Carry on. See you back at the house, Grace. - So, you're a veteran? - Captain Grace Garland, Third Marine. Have a nice day, Captain. - Joe? - Hey. You made it. - Did you get a ticket? - No. After you left, he let me go. Great. So, I'm headed to the Army base with my buddy, about an hour from here. - Maybe you'd like to join us? - Why? What's up? We volunteered to hand out Christmas trees to vets at the base. Cooper's wife Sheri is the local coordinator. She served in Afghanistan, too, and just thought maybe you'd like to meet her and see some other vets. Mainly, she wants to see Justice. She just puts up with me and Coop. Hey. You! - That's your friend, Cooper? - Yup, for better or for worse. Watch out, watch out! Good girl! - Hi, hon. - Hi. You look especially good today. But then again, I do love a woman who hands out Christmas trees. Yeah, well, you better say that, you're my husband. Sheri, this is Captain Grace Garland. She's staying with the judge for a while. Nice to meet you, Grace. Is there a story here? Yes, but not the one that you think. Well, I've love to hear all about it, but right now, we've got work to do. Let's go! I got more Christmas! It was my last patrol before shipping out. We were looking for survivors in a collapsed building, and my dog had already helped rescue a 10-year-old Afghani girl, pregnant mother. I mean, it was a good day. It was a really good day. Then, out of nowhere, we came under fire. There was an explosion, and... I was knocked off my feet, there was dust everywhere. I was disoriented, and I was exposed to enemy fire. My dog pulled me into safety. I think Christmas probably saved my life. A week later, he was reassigned to a different handler and I was shipped home. - Coffee? - Yeah. - Can I ask you something, Grace? - Sure, I guess. Why Christmas? Why did you name your dog Christmas? Because he was delivered to my barracks on Christmas Day six Christmases ago. That explains it. He was a mistake, actually. I was supposed to get a trained nine-month-old Lab that November, and instead, I got a nine-week-old puppy on Christmas Day. It was a clerical error. It was the best mistake the Marines ever made. Sorry to keep you waiting, Captain. Your dog's been stationed out in Kandahar with the 101st Battalion, Eighth Marines. Okay. So, he's okay? As far as I can tell. - I'm sorry about your dog, Grace. - Thanks. I'm just glad to know that he's okay. Look, there's a woman in town that fosters rescue dogs. We could stop there on the way home. Thanks, I don't think so. Christmas wasn't just any dog. He was my partner, my friend, my family. We worked together every day for six years. I mean, he got me through that war. I know some people. I've got friends with military connections. Maybe I could help. I appreciate it. I do. The thing is, there isn't anything anybody can do. I just have to accept the truth. Christmas isn't mine anymore. Oh, what do you think about that? Huh? Yeah, that feels nice. Oh, you're so pretty, huh? Would you want to go for a long walk today? That'd be nice, huh? Or we could go shopping, get you a new Christmas collar 'cause this one's looking a little worse for the wear. Yes! Good morning. - You're up early. - Well, blame the military. Rise and shine. I made some coffee, if you want some. Thanks, yeah. I believe I do. You know, you're going to spoil my dog, and then, what'll I do? Well, this one deserves to be spoiled. She's a sweetheart. A little cream, no sugar, right? Thanks. So, I was wondering if maybe you would like to join me for lunch today. I could drive my grown-up car and you could drive the scout. You have a grown-up car? I do, but I keep it hidden in the barn. Makes sense. What time for lunch? Well, how about we meet on the courthouse steps at high noon? Will Gary Cooper be there? It's getting late. I got to jump in the shower. I forgot to feed the dog. Don't worry about it. I'll feed Justice. - Really? - Yeah. Okay, well, her dry food is under the sink, and then, I have some canned food in the fridge. Now, I usually use a spoonful of the canned food, and I mix it with hot water, and then, I add about 3/4 of a cup of the dry food. What were you saying about not spoiling your dog? Well, maybe a little. - Yeah. - Yeah. Ready for some breakfast? I bet! How's that sit with you, Dorothy? Does that sound like a fair compromise? Yes, it does, Your Honour. Thank you. For that which is equitable seems to be just, and equity is justice that goes beyond the written law. That's Aristotle, folks, for those of you keeping score. Case dismissed. So, you got this speeding ticket on your way home from basketball practice? Yes, sir. - Is that what you call a fast break? - No, sir. Lawrence, I'm gonna give you an early Christmas present. Instead of giving you a violation, I'm gonna ask that you spend your next two Saturdays volunteering at the food bank. How does that sound? That sounds good. Thank you, Your Honour. Now, do you think you might give me a little Christmas present in return? Yes, sir. Good. What I want from you is a promise that you'll go to college. - Are you gonna play ball in college? - I don't think so. I'm not that good. I see. Well, that's okay. Getting a good education is what really matters. At any rate, keep up the good work, keep up the good grades, and go out and make us proud. Thank you, Your Honour. I will. Case dismissed! It must be hard on you being away from your family for so long. Well, it's just me and my brother now, and he's got his own life in Alaska. We exchange a lot of email, though. I can't tell you how impressed I am with how you run your courtroom. Well, thank you. I've never seen a judge like you, not even on TV. I'm gonna hope that that was a compliment. It was! I'm curious, how do you become the judge in your hometown? Well, I didn't plan it that way. It just kind of happened. But I hope I'm not staying much longer. What do you mean? I've applied for an appointment to the district court in Chicago. - I'm expecting news any day now. - Fingers crossed! - You must be excited. - I am. It's been a long time coming. I'm pretty sure River's Crossing is going to miss you. - You think so? - I do. I also get the feeling that you're going to miss River's Crossing. - Thank you so much. - Thank you. Thanks, hon. Hey, Joe! How's my favourite judge? Still banging the gavel. How about you, Colonel? You know, trying to stay out of trouble, but it's not easy. Hey, did you hear Marnie's coming home for Christmas? No, I hadn't heard. Yeah, yeah, Margaret and I are thrilled. Better yet, she's coming alone. Apparently, she and David called it quits. You should stop by, Joe. I'm sure she'd love to see you. Thank you very much for the invite. I appreciate that. Colonel, I would like to introduce you to Captain Grace Garland. She's recently back from Afghanistan, and visiting River's Crossing for a few days. Grace, this is my good friend Colonel Mike Radcliffe. Pleasure to meet you, Captain, but, don't let him pull your leg with that "good friend" nonsense. The judge here was supposed to be my son-in-law. I better get Margaret her lunch before she starves to death. Come by the house, Joe, huh? - We'll share some Christmas cheer. - Sure. - And welcome home, Grace. - Thank you, sir. - You bet. See you, Joe. - Good to see you, Mike. All the best. You know, I feel like I should explain that encounter with the Colonel. That's okay. You don't have to explain anything. I was engaged to his daughter, and well, he was pretty happy about that. But then, last summer, she broke up with me and she ran off to Chicago with the town's former prosecutor. - I'm sorry, that's awful. - It's okay, I'm over it now. Oh, darn, I'm gonna be late. I gotta run. I'll see you tonight! Thanks for lunch! Here comes my specialty. - Triple cheese, double-baked eggs. - Can't wait. You want some orange juice? Yes, ma'am! So, how did you end up with a career in the military? Well, it's a long story and it's not all that interesting. Try me. Well, the military offers a great opportunity to get an education, so I applied for an ROTC scholarship. - What'd you study? - I studied engineering. And then, after graduating, I worked for two years creating and maintaining a geospatial database for the Marines at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina. - Sounds interesting. - It was... a great experience, and it was challenging work. But ultimately, it wasn't for me. I realized I didn't want to be sitting behind a desk. I always loved dogs, so I got myself transferred to Search and Rescue. Then, the Marines sent me to Afghanistan. And how was that? Loved Search and Rescue. Explosive detection, not so much. Is that why you left? One day of soldiering is like ten days of civilian life, and after six years, it changes you. It was time, but... leaving my unit was one of the hardest decisions I ever made. I can only imagine. - I'm starving. Let's eat. - Me too! Okay, you ready? Where is it? Where's it gonna be? Okay, find it, find it! Good job! Good girl, good girl. You did it. What a good girl. That's, that's impressive. We're just having fun, and it's good for the dog's concentration. Maybe I should try that sometime. Hey, I'm gonna head into town and meet with Aunt Nellie. We're putting up Christmas decorations today, you want to come along? I think I'll pass. You do realize that Aunt Nellie will disown me if I show up without you? Normally, I would say that's hyperbole, but in this case, I believe you. All right, Justice. I guess that means fetch is gonna have to wait 'cause I'm being summoned to a higher purpose. You have no idea. This is the time of year that we get River's Crossing - all gussied up for the big event. - Big event? The Winter Wonderland Festival. It's the highlight of the year. The whole thing culminates right here with the annual Christmas Eve potluck party. In the barn? Trust me. You'll barely recognize this place come Christmas Eve. Well, I guess that would explain all the decorations. You don't know the half of it. We better get going, though. Aunt Nellie hates it when I'm late. Lead the way. You're late! I know, I know, but I brought reinforcements. Look who's here to help. Hi, Grace! I'm so glad you're here. This is quite the operation you have going. Well, we like to think that we're second only to Santa's workshop. You ready for your assignment? Yes, ma'am. Ready, willing and able. Same as last year, light bulbs on Main Street? Bingo! So, the guy shows up in my courtroom wearing his Santa costume. White beard, big belly, the works. I mean, it's like a scene out of Miracle on 34th Street. - No way! - Yes way! And then, he looks me square in the face, and he says, "But Your Honour, I swear, Santa didn't do it!" - He didn't. - He did! And then, you're not gonna believe this. He insists that he has elves that will corroborate his story. Yeah, sitting on the bench in River's Crossing can be rather entertaining. Apparently. So, what about you? Now that your military career is over, what are your plans? Well, I have been offered a job at an engineering firm in Cincinnati, where I grew up. It's entry-level, but you know, after working Search and Rescue for a few years, I feel lucky to have the job. - So, back behind a desk, then. - Yup, but after combat duty, I'm ready for a little less excitement. And where would you like these, Your Honour? Those just go down the street. Here, let me take that from you, and... follow me! - Hey. - Hey! I can hardly believe it. Last year this time, I was in Bagram. No way! I was in Bagram last Christmas, too! Feels like another lifetime ago. Yeah, I can relate. It's been a big adjustment being back stateside. I really miss it. Well, if you need a dose of the military, you can always join me at the base. We're delivering trees for at least another week, and we can always use volunteers, especially a vet. Someone who's been there. - I might just take you up on that. - Good, and bring Justice if you do. I just heard you used to be Search and Rescue. I can't believe nobody told me! We used to have a very active Search and Rescue program by the sheriff's department, but Ike Monrow, the head of our SARS department, retired last year. We're still looking for a replacement, though. Don't look at me. I'm out of that line of work. Come on, never say never. We should at least talk about it, right? Have dinner with Sheri and I tonight. You can even let Joe tag along here, if you'd like. No, no. We've got plans tonight. - We do? - Yup. That is, if you're down for a little Christmastime tradition. - I will need your shoe size, though. - My shoe size? I think I'm the only person in this town that can't skate. What do you mean? You're doing great. Yeah! Well, at least there's room for improvement. Who's that? Hi, Joe. - I was hoping I would see you here. - Hey, Marnie. How are you? I'm great. Back home for the holidays. I heard. I ran into your dad. Marnie, this is my friend Grace. Grace, this is Marnie. Hi, Grace! So nice to meet you. Sorry. Just a little, wobbly. Don't worry, you'll catch on. Do you mind if I steal Joe for a quick skate? Well... I'll be right back. She won the Junior Olympics figure skating in high school, but you could play hockey with her Christmas cookies. Can't bake a lick. Okay, I'm heading to the concession. You want anything? - Some hot chocolate, please. - One hot chocolate, coming up. - With whipped cream! - You got it! Joe, can I talk with you? Because I think I'm going to fall to pieces if I don't say something. - What do you mean? - About what happened between us. Seeing you again, skating together, it made me remember just how much we've shared, and how much I've missed you. I know I don't deserve it, but I hope you can forgive me for what happened with David. I was so confused. Marnie, you left me for another man. I know, and I am so sorry. I think I just wanted to get out of River's Crossing. I couldn't see myself staying here the rest of my life, but honestly, I thought about you the whole time I was in Chicago. You know, that was a lot of fun. Thanks for being such a good sport. I'm afraid I got more bruises than I can count. Do you need some ice? No, I think I've had enough ice for one night, thank you very much. - Thank your sister for the skates. - I will. - How was it seeing your fiancée? - Ex-fiancée, and to tell the truth, it was bittersweet. At one point, I thought I was going to spend my life with her. That's over now. Relationships are complicated, aren't they? Yeah, I guess they are. How about you? Are you in a complicated relationship? I was, but he was transferred to the base at Okinawa. We tried to make it work, but long-distance is really hard. Yeah. Would you like to stay for a cup of tea? No, thanks, I'm pretty tired. Thanks again, that was really fun. Don't you think you might be overdoing this Christmas thing a little bit? Overdoing? Didn't I tell you my motto? No, I don't believe you did. You can never, ever have too much Christmas. - Is that right? - Absolutely. As a matter of fact, I am on my way to my mom's to decorate her house. You want to join? Seriously, Joe, what's with all the decorations? Well, probably because my dad loved Christmas. It was by far his favourite holiday, and he always did up the house in a major way. And now that he's gone, I try to carry on that tradition. And it makes my mom happy. I hope you two are hungry! Lunch is ready. Sorry about the mess. Grace, I hope you're okay with tuna melts and tomato soup. This looks perfect. Well, Joe will have to bring you back some night for dinner so I can make you a proper meal. Are you kidding me? I dreamed about eating meals like these when I was in Afghanistan. Well, I hope it's okay. And thank you again for helping this guy decorate my house. Happy to help. So, you must be a proud mom having a judge for a son. Doesn't do me any good. I still had to pay a traffic ticket. Mom, I didn't want to set the wrong precedent. She still hasn't forgiven me. He knows I'm just kidding! I couldn't be prouder. You know, he graduated Northwestern Law, Order of the Coif. That's just a fancy way of saying that I graduated top of my class. All of the best Chicago firms made offers, and he turned them all down to come back to River's Crossing. Joe gave up a lot when his dad died. Instead of starting a career, he came home to help me through a really tough time, and I love him for it! Now, who wants coffee and fresh-baked cookies for dessert? Grandma! We got here as soon as we could! Have you made the snowman cookies yet? No, I haven't. I was waiting for you two! I get to put the noses on the reindeer. That's my job every year! Yes! Uncle Joe. Do you want to help us decorate? Grace can help, too. Does Santa live at the North Pole? You bet he does! - What's the big hurry? - Believe me. You do not want to be late for the Christmas tree lighting. I thought you were late for everything. Not for this! It's the start of the Winter Wonderland Festival. How old are you again? You'll see. Welcome, everyone, to the official start of the Winter Wonderland Festival! As your Christmas chairperson, I am delighted to tell you that this year, River's Crossing is fortunate to have a very special guest in town. She is a decorated veteran, recently returned from Afghanistan, a friend of our own Judge Joe's, and soon to be this year's Santa's Special Helper! Give a warm River's Crossing welcome to Captain Grace Garland! Come on up! Come on up! Now, it's time to take the River's Crossing Christmas pledge. - Are you ready? - I guess I am. Do you promise to light the town's Christmas tree, thereby lighting the spirit of Christmas in the hearts of every single soul in River's Crossing? It's not difficult a question, dear. I do! Yes, I now appoint you Santa's Special Helper! Let the countdown begin! Ten, nine, eight! Seven, six, five! Four, three, two, one! So, this guy gets all of his trees from a local farm that donates over a thousand Christmas trees to veterans every year. So, I always get mine here. Are you a blue spruce or a Fraser fir kind of guy? It all depends. I let the trees speak to me. We'll know the right one when we see it. This'll be interesting. I really enjoyed lunch with your mom and the kids yesterday. Well, they certainly like you. But then, you are pretty likable. My mom went through a pretty rough patch after my dad passed, but she made it out the other side, and now she's pretty much back to her old self again. She seems happy. Yeah, I think she is. I finally feel like I can leave River's Crossing and resurrect my career. What are you hoping to accomplish? District court judge would be a nice place to start, but I hope to go further. Really? Yeah, once I get to Chicago, the sky's the limit. I know you can't compare serving a small town like River's Crossing with being a district court judge in Chicago, but from my perspective, you've got it pretty good here. I know, but I've always wanted to do more important work. You are doing important work. I've been to your courtroom, and you make a real difference in people's lives. Yeah, but I want to weigh in on the big issues. And I would like to be able to get a cappuccino, or eat some sushi, go to the opera. The grass isn't always greener, you know, especially in a big city where I'm pretty sure it's mostly cement. - Wait a sec, what about this one? - You think so? Yeah! - It reminds me of someone. - Really, who? - Isn't it obvious? - Beautiful, complex. "Grace-ful". - Good one. - Thank you, thank you very much. All right, let get this baby home. Let's do it. Hi. - Thank you. - Thank you. Told you. And you would give this up for $6 coffee and cold fish. It's looking pretty good. I think it's even better than last year's tree. What do you think about the angel? Do you like it? - I love the angel. - Yeah, me too. That's it, we're done! This is our tree. You know, I think we make a pretty good team. Are you okay? What's wrong, Grace? I can barely remember my parents, but... it was okay because Gramps took care of me and my brother, and he was kind and sweet and generous, and he made Christmas so special. He would make these snowman pancakes on Christmas morning with marshmallow eyes and chocolate buttons. You see, the thing about this holiday, especially now with my dog. I am just so grateful for the warmth and hospitality that you and your family have shown me, especially this time of year. Yes! Grace, you have a phone call. It's Katie. She wants to talk to you. - Hello? - Hey, Grace! How are you? Your brother's a sweetheart. He's taking such good care of me. Oh, he better be. Hey, look, I'm calling to see if you can help me with some Christmas shopping today. Don't worry, I promise the shops in River's Crossing are adorable, plus there will be lunch involved. - Are you sure? - Sure I'm sure! - You do remember how to shop, right? - Well, you might have to hold me back. I haven't been outside a PX in quite a while. Okay, see you there. Now, Grace, I want you to know my offer still stands. Like I said, you'll head the entire department and oversee everything, what do you say? It's a very generous offer, sheriff, but I've got a job waiting for me in Cincinnati. Don't make me arrest you. - Merry Christmas, Cooper. - Merry Christmas, Grace. - Just think about it, all right? - Yeah. What was all that about? He wants me to head the Search and Rescue department for the county in River's Crossing. No kidding! That sounds pretty amazing. - Yeah, it would be if I lived here. - Well...? He's never had a glass of eggnog since. Yeah, I bet! Look at this one! Isn't it gorgeous? I just love the colours. What do you think, Grace? Grace? I'm sure it's nothing. Do you think he still loves her? I don't know. I don't think so. Enough about that. Let's get back to shopping. I've got a better idea. Consider it a little early Christmas present, and a foolproof way to lift your spirits. Come on. After Peter left, I had to adjust to being a single mom. It wasn't easy, but I was lucky because my mom helps a lot, and Joe stepped up big-time. He's become a real father figure to Addie, and Tyler too. She sure seems to love her Uncle Joe. Oh, yeah. The sun rises and sets with Uncle Joe. So, what about you? Are you happy to be out of the military? It might sound a little strange, but I actually miss the Marines. Yeah, I had great friends. Family, really. And I had a job that was important. People's lives were at stake. Now, I don't know what I feel. A little lost, I guess. Have you thought about what you want to do now that you're a civilian again? Yeah. Stop having dreams about the war, and not feel like an alien when I do ordinary things like go to the grocery store. I can't imagine. You know, I never thought what life would be like after I got out, or how alone I would feel. Well, maybe you should consider Cooper's offer, stay in River's Crossing. It's a friendly place, and I can introduce you to a lot of friends. That's super sweet, thank you. I'm just, I'm passing through. They're gorgeous. - Thank you. - Merry Christmas. Hey. Hey, there you are! How'd it go? It was fun, Katie's great. - How was your day? - Better now that you're here. I did a little shopping of my own today, and now I'm getting a head-start on my wrapping. I'm usually not doing this until Christmas Eve. Good for you. I saw you in town today. You did? Yeah, you were with Marnie. We were in the shop across the street. Oh, yeah? It's funny, we just happened to run into each other. It's a small town. Katie gave me an early Christmas present. Nice! Hey, you want to help me cook dinner? I've got some chops and some greens in the fridge. No, I don't think so. I'm not very hungry, but I was wondering if we could stop by Uncle Roy's tomorrow and check on my car. - Yeah, of course. - Great. Good night. Night. Uncle Roy, you have a visitor. Hey, there she is! How are you, Grace? Have you been enjoying your time in River's Crossing? I really have. Everyone's been really welcoming. Well, word might have got around that you haven't had a real Christmas in quite some time. I don't understand. How... Let's just say that Nellie is very good at spreading the word. And we appreciate the sacrifice you made for our country. Thank you. I hope we're not disturbing you, but I just wanted to check and see when you think my car might be ready. I have good news on that front... and some bad news. It's good and bad news. Okay, I'll take the good news first. I was able to rebuild your engine, and replace the cylinder head and the shock absorber. Well, that all sounds great! Can I get the car now? What? Nothing, just... right! There's bad news, as well, which is that the control arm has not arrived yet, and so, I really tried, but unfortunately, your car will not be ready until after Christmas. Oh, really? There is a silver lining. At least you'll be here for the Christmas festivities. - Are you ready for the big festival? - As long as no elf hats are involved. - I can't make any promises. - Oh, well. I do, however, need my Santa suit. The North Pole requires my services tonight. I've got three separate shifts at Santa's village. Will you be okay with Katie and the kids while I make like a jolly old fella? Of course. - What do you think? - I think red's your colour. Hey, Judge! You ask Santa for a new gavel? Merry Christmas, Judge! Is there anyone in this town you don't know? This is amazing. - You can go talk to her, you know. - Oh, no, thank you. I'm very happy right here where I am. Uncle Joe! - Uncle Joe! - Hi, Grace. - Did I die and go to heaven? - Very funny. You look adorable. What's it for? She's the lead in this year's Christmas play. It's called "Heaven Can't Wait". It's pretty funny. Well, we can't wait to see it, but right now, I have some Christmas business that I need to take care of. Do you think you guys can stay out of trouble while I'm gone, especially my little angel here? It might help if we had some caramel corn to keep us occupied. Oh, yeah, Uncle Joe! Caramel corn is an excellent idea. Caramel corn, all around. I hear Caramel Christmas Crunch is the way to go. - Okay, see you later! - See you guys later. - You don't get dizzy, do you? - I don't think so, but I haven't been on one of these since I was a kid. Last Christmas for me. - Are you warm enough? - Perfect. I think I'm the one who's going to get dizzy. But maybe it's just the company. You know, your face lights up when you smile. - You think so? - I know so. What are the odds? I mean, what are the chances you would knock on my door and the two of us would end up here? Maybe it's just dumb luck. You could talk to Justice. She did have something to do with it. I guess I'm gonna have to thank her, then. I already did. Hey, there you two are. Did you have a good time on the ride? - Joe got a little dizzy. - It was all her fault. She kept telling the reindeer to go faster and faster! Can I get you some hot cider, warm you up? Yes, please. Hey, I'll be right back. You know, Joe? I don't think I've ever seen you this happy. I know it's none of my business but if you ask me, she's a keeper. So, don't screw it up. You know, you are just full of great advice. Yup. Hey, Joe! Aren't you due at Santa's village? Five minutes ago! I got to go. I'll see you at the big Christmas tree in an hour? Okay. I swear that boy was born a week past his mother's due date, and he's been late ever since. - Ready for that cider? - Yes, please. Hey, Grace! Have you seen Joe? You just missed him. He went to Santa's village. Oh, darn. I was hoping he could help. What's the matter? Addie is struggling with a bout of stage fright. She doesn't want to be in the play now. - Oh, no! After all that practice? - I know! I thought maybe Joe could talk to her. She always listens to him. Could I be of any help? I don't know, maybe. It's worth a try. Okay. Sweetie, I thought you were excited about the play? I was, but I don't want to anymore. I'm afraid I'm going to forget all my lines. Sweetheart. You have been rehearsing for weeks now. You know your lines backwards and forwards. My stomach hurts. You know, Addie, everybody's afraid sometimes. I mean, I was afraid every single day when I was in Afghanistan. But I thought you were brave. That's what everybody says. Soldiers are brave. They say that because we do our job for our country, but that doesn't mean we're not afraid. - Really? - Absolutely. Bravery is doing what you're afraid to do, what you think you can't do. There isn't any courage at all if you aren't scared. What do you think? You want to try being brave? Yeah? Good. Merry Christmas, boys and girls! I bet they don't make Santas like that in Cincinnati. No, they don't. Come on, let's find out what you want for Christmas. You could stay, you know? I have to admit it's hard not to fall in love with this place. Do you see Rudolph flying up there? Merry Christmas, everybody! So good! Was I brave? You were very brave, and you were very good. Unbelievable. You were amazing! - Did you like it? - More than words can say. I am so, so proud of you. I love the part when you sang the solo. And the part when she was bumping into the other angels? Yes! I was laughing so hard tears were running down my cheeks. - Really? - Really. Congratulations. I should take this. Addie... Hello. Yes, this is Judge Joseph Peterson. Yes. Thank you. This is an incredible honour. January 5th? Yes, I can make that work. Absolutely, of course. Thank you again, and Merry Christmas. That was Chicago. I just got appointed to the district court. Congratulations. That's amazing news. My first day on the bench is January 5th. This is incredible. I didn't expect this to happen so soon. I got a lot to do. Don't worry, you'll get it all done. But Uncle Joe, Chicago's so far away and you already have a job. I'm sorry. I didn't want you to find out like this. Call him back and tell him you have to stay here. Tell him you have to be a judge here in River's Crossing. I am so sorry. I really am. I'm gonna miss seeing you every day, too. But it's gonna work out, you'll see. I'll come and I'll visit whenever I can, and you can come visit me in Chicago. - I don't want you to go. - Addie, I am so sorry. Let's not let this ruin your big day. Let's go see your mom and your grandma. They're waiting for us in the lobby. Yeah. It's okay. - What's the matter, Addison? - Is everything okay? I just learned I got the appointment in Chicago. She was there when the call came in. Sweetie. This a big deal for your uncle. Come here, let Grandma give you a big hug. We all know how much this girl loves her uncle, but you know what, pumpkin? He's gonna come back and visit, and right now, we have to be very happy for him because it's important to Uncle Joe. Can you try? Okay. How about this talented niece of mine? Was she terrific, or what? I am so proud of you! You remembered all your lines. And these are for you, Addison. Congratulations. Mom, is it okay if Grace helps me change out of my costume? Of course. Do you mind? I'd love that. Come on. You know, for such a smart guy, sometimes, Uncle Joe can be pretty dumb. He thinks being a judge in Chicago is more important than being a judge here, but he's wrong about that. Why do you think that? Because he's the smartest, best judge you've ever seen, and people here really appreciate him. Everybody in River's Crossing knows him, everyone loves him, but I love him most of all. I know this is really difficult, Addie. But your Uncle Joe has worked really hard for this, and sometimes, when you love someone, you have to try to be happy for them, even though it might hurt on the inside. Are you going to miss him too, Grace? Yeah, I think I am. I thought so. My mom says you're the best thing that ever happened to Uncle Joe. Did she? I mean, I'm only 12, but isn't love more important than a job in Chicago? You're pretty smart yourself there, kiddo. Do you think some hot cocoa would make us feel better? I think that's the best thing I've heard all day. Let's do it. What a wonderful night this has been. Congratulations, son. I am so, so proud of all of your accomplishments, and now this. - I couldn't be happier for you. - Thanks, Mom. Hey, come here, you! Give me a hug. - Uncle Joe? - Yeah. Grace and I talked about you leaving for Chicago, and I want you to know that if that's what you really, really, really, really want, then I'm gonna try hard to be happy for you. Thank you, Addison. And Grace. It really means a lot to me. That's about the best Christmas present I could ever wish for. Well, there might be a tie, too. You have no idea how much I'm going to miss all of you. I'd better go. Aunt Nellie and Uncle Roy are going to need help coaxing Tyler off the carousel. Did I mention how sharp you look in that red suit? - You think so? - Absolutely. It's very becoming. The white beard, the big belly, it somehow works for you. Well, I can tell you one thing. It's been one heck of a day for old Santa. I don't know. It seems to me like your dreams are finally being realized. Yeah, but now my dream seems kind of different now that it's become a reality. Well, Santa's a wise old fella. I'm confident that he'll figure it out. Well, here we are, safe and sound. Do you want me to hang that up for you? Thank you. Grace, can I ask you something? Sure. What do you think I should do? I can't tell you what you should do, Joe. I think you have to search your heart, and figure out what's most important to you. Right. I should let you get some sleep. Don't worry. Things have a way of working out. I hope so. Night, Grace. Good night, Joe. Sleep well. That is wonderful news, Marnie. I am so excited. Have you spoken to your dad about it? Does he know? What does he say? Really? I love you so much for this, Marnie. I am... I am so excited that I am over the moon about this. Yes, of course. Hey there, sleepyhead. Want some coffee? No, thanks. I'm... Maybe I'll get some later. - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. I just, I'm feeling... I'm feeling a little off this morning. - Can I get you anything? - No, I'm fine. Gee, I hope so. I mean, it's Christmas Eve. Yeah. And we have the big party in the barn tonight. How did it get to be so late? I got to run. If you need anything, please call me. Merry Christmas, Justice. You take care of Joe now, do you hear me? You sweet dog. - Hey. - What's up, Grace? - Can you do me a favour? - Oh, it depends. Can you give those keys to Joe and tell him that the scout's parked out front of the cafe? I guess, sure. You heading off somewhere? Back to Cincinnati where I belong. - What, like now? - Yeah. - Bus leaves in ten minutes. - Well, no, no, no. Grace, what about Joe? I mean, tonight's the big party, tomorrow's Christmas. You can't just leave. - Come on, what about your car? - I don't know. I don't care. I'll get it some other time. This is crazy, Grace. You can't just leave! I'm really sorry about the Search and Rescue program. What you were offering me was a dream come true. Then, don't leave. Okay, you're the perfect person to head the department. I can't. I don't belong here. You're wrong about that, Grace. You do belong here, and I'm not the only one who thinks so. Please give Sheri a big hug for me. I don't know how you got so lucky, but you have an incredible woman there, and please tell Katie and Addie and Fran, and Nellie and everybody, please tell them all thank you so much because I'm going to miss them more than they could ever know. Grace! Please excuse me. This better be good, Coop. You know where I am. Joe, did you know that Grace is heading back to Cincinnati? - Yeah, sometime after Christmas. - No, today! What do you mean? Why would she do that? I don't know, but for some reason, she feels that she doesn't belong here. She's getting on a bus right now. - You got to stop her, Coop. - How am I supposed to do that? I don't know, but you gotta help me out here. Under no circumstances is Grace to leave River's Crossing. - Well, Joe, it's not like... - I'm counting on you, Coop. Just make it happen. We're gonna pick this up on Monday, folks, after Christmas. Court is adjourned. Just be a minute, looking for someone. - Grace, I'm sorry to disturb you. - What are you doing here? I'm here to bring you back to River's Crossing. Why? I can't exactly say, but it's important. It's really, really important. - You can't be serious. - I'm asking you as a friend. Because if you don't, I'm pretty much guaranteed to have the worst Christmas of my life. So, what do you say? Please? Cooper, what are we doing here? It's Christmas Eve, Grace. Come on. Here she is. Thanks, Coop. Merry Christmas, Grace. What is all this? Grace, the truth is I am crazy about you, and I want to assure you that I'm not going to Chicago or anywhere else. You're not? No, and between you and me, I don't like sushi that much, anyway. I don't understand, Joe. I heard you on the phone with Marnie. I'm getting to that. Christmas! Christmas! Hi! Christmas! My sweet! You're really here! I can't believe you're here! That's my good boy. Yes! How did you do this? Thank you, Joe! Thank you so much. I'm sorry for the subterfuge. I didn't want to tell you until I was absolutely sure that we could get Christmas to River's Crossing. It was Marnie and the Colonel who made it happen. Thank you! I can't tell you how much this means to me. Whoa! At ease, Marine. I don't know how you did this. I didn't think I'd ever see Christmas again. I pulled some strings, called in some favours, and got her qualified for early retirement. No mission too difficult, no sacrifice too great. I found out this morning that Christmas had arrived from Afghanistan with a representative from American Humane, and I called Joe right away to let him know that he was safe and sound. He's all yours now. Your car's been ready for days. - I can't believe you did all this. - This is River's Crossing. People care here. And they love a good Christmas party. Welcome to River's Crossing, Christmas. - Hey, that job offer still good, Cooper? - Job's yours, Grace, as long as Christmas is part of the deal. Merry Christmas, Grace Garland. Merriest Christmas ever, Joe Peterson.
