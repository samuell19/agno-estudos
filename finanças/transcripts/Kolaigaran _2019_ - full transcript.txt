"He is a murderer." "He is a murderer." 'KOLAIGARAN' "A murderer.." "A murderer." Hello. - Sir Prabhakaran has turned himself in at R1 police station. We haven't taken his confession statement yet. ADGP wants you here immediately. I shall inform the area VAO too. No, wait until I reach there. Okay, sir. Sir, he doesn't look like a killer. We haven't informed the VAO yet. I heard you ordered not to. But why, sir? First, let's hear his confession. Go ahead. 'Smoking and drinking alcohol are injurious to health.' "Don't take my life away.." "The marks of your love in my heart won't heal." "Don't you run away after breathing fire into me." "The taste of your kisses will remain with me forever." "Here I am, standing thirsty for your love in the middle of a sea." "I'm shivering. Don't you see me?" "You are the only one in all my dreams and I am.." "Waiting for you, my dear! I am all alone!" "Waiting for you, my dear! I am all alone!" "Don't take my life away.." "The marks of your love in my heart won't heal." "Don't you run away after breathing fire into me." "The taste of your kisses will remain with me forever." "Here I am, standing thirsty for your love in the middle of a sea." "I'm shivering. Don't you see me?" "You are the only one in all my dreams and I am.." "I am all alone!" "I am all alone!" "When you are not around, I can feel the darkness surround me." "It's because you are my light and you are all I see." "Why can't we unite?" "Where did my love fall short and went in vain?" "So far away from me.. Is that you?" "Can't we eliminate this space between us" "and make our dreams come true?" "Even the sea can't match the love we have for each other." "Don't look for me. I'm just a sacrifice in your love." "I will neither let go of you nor forget you." "But where do I look for you?" "Waiting for you, my dear! I am all alone!" "Waiting for you, my dear! I am all alone!" "Don't take my life away.." "The marks of your love in my heart won't heal." "Don't you run away after breathing fire into me." "The taste of your kisses will remain with me forever." "Here I am, standing thirsty for your love in the middle of a sea." "I'm shivering. Don't you see me?" "You are the only one in all my dreams and I am.." "I am all alone!" "Waiting for you, my dear! I am all alone!" 'Last night, in two separate incidents on the East coast road' 'two youngsters from Chennai' 'were brutally attacked under mysterious conditions.' 'They were in a life-threatening state when found by the police.' 'Further, a complaint was lodged..' 'The nomadic males will have to fend for themselves completely.' 'The unconscious youngsters are admitted in the hospital.' 'While the identity of the attacker is still a mystery' 'it has been reported that the duo could be a part of some gang.' 'Because the police have found out that there are already cases' 'registered against them in the police station.' Bye, Mom. Hello. Hi. Hi, Roopa - Hi. So, did he again step out at the same time as you did? Look, we can call it a coincidence if this happened once or twice. But how does he step out at the same time as you do? That too, every single day? Don't you think it's too much? Why should we think about it unnecessarily? He doesn't seem to be a bad person. Do you know what I feel about it? He wakes up, gets ready waits for you to step out and only then he steps out. I'm sure he is interested in you. It's okay if he is in love with you. But if he turns out to be a stalker or an obsessive lover then it's dangerous. Please be careful. I guess you're watching too many movies. Stop scaring me early in the morning. Shut up! Didn't Prabhakaran come to office today? He informed you yesterday that he would be on leave today. Did you forget? I would have remembered if he had asked for my permission. But all he does is just give information, right? Isn't he a bit strange? He comes in, minds his own business and leaves. At times, it's scary to even talk to him. Hello. - I found the address, sir. I will share the location now. But please do not reveal that I helped you. Sir. What happened? Kotai is no more. Babu? - He is still comatose. If he wakes up, we can find out who did this. But it doesn't look like he will wake up. 'In 0.1 mile, take right.' 'You have reached your destination.' Bye, Mom. Hi. - Hi. No, mom agreed. My dad is.. Mr. Senthil. - Yes, ma'am? Drop me here. - Ok, ma'am. Roaming around town.. Shall I marry someone else? I will thrash you. Bye, Roopa. - Bye. Open the door, Dharini! Dharini? - Mom. Dharini.. - Mom.. Dharini. What happened? Vamsi.. Vamsi is here, Mom. What do you mean? I had been to the supermarket. I saw him there. I am sure he is here for us. Could it be him? I don't know. But I escaped without him noticing me. Who is it? - The EB guy, ma'am. Hello, control room. Sir, I'm calling from the warehouse road at Vyasarpadi. There is a corpse lying in the ground next to the warehouse. Control room to Vyasarpadi patrol. Control room to Vyasarpadi patrol. Vyasarpadi patrol reporting. Our location is Erukkancheri high road. There is a gathering at the warehouse road. Please check and report back. Vyasarpadi patrol to control room. We are at the spot. It looks like CrPC suspect. Please send in more force. Sir! Did the crowd contaminate the crime scene? A few people were here before us. Once the force got here, everything is under control Everything is in order, sir. Who gave the information? - Someone staying here. They called 100. Did you call for the ambulance? - On its way, sir. What about Rani? - Informed. On the way. Sir, Rani is here. Give me a pen - Sir. Here you go, sir. Sir, ADGP is here. - Oh. Sir! CrPC suspect, sir. The body is burnt. The face is damaged to the extent that it is unrecognisable. But it doesn't appear to be done by a gang. We can move further in this case only after identifying the corpse. Not committed by a gang sounds dangerous. I want you to form a team at once and start the investigation. - Okay, sir. See how quickly you can identify the corpse. - Yes, sir. Get me the report as soon as possible. - Sure, sir. Bring in that person who saw it first. I was the one who called 100. Last night, I was on my way back home after work at around 8:30. I noticed something was burning at a distance. I thought the kids must've set the garbage on fire. But when I saw in the morning, it was a corpse. You may leave. - Okay, sir. Sir, Rani couldn't sniff out any clue. What do we do now, sir? - Murali. - Sir. The trouser worn by the deceased was tailor-made. It's half burnt. 'ABAD' can be seen on the tailor's label. Maybe it's 'Hyderabad', 'Allahabad'.. Something like that. So, the deceased might not be from here. You do one thing.. - Sir. Check if any hotel or lodges in the city have filed a missing person complaint. Okay? - Okay, sir. - That'll be good for now. - Sure, sir. Hello. Hello. Hello. It's me, Prabhakaran. Tell me. I hope everything is fine there. I hope everything is normal. - Yes. There is no problem here. Tell me. What is the matter? Dharini.. - Dharini? Dharini is quite scared. Pass the phone to Dharini. Tell me. Are you very scared? No.. Yes - Keep this in mind. The calmer you are the easier it will be to handle this issue. I am sorry. One more thing. The police have found the corpse. You must have read about it in the newspaper. But there is no need to fear. Everything is going on as per the plan. Apart from us, does anyone else know that we are communicating? No. No one knows. Please maintain it as it is. Do not reveal anything to anyone. If you have anything to tell me do so when I call you. Sounds good? - Okay. Fine, I'll hang up now. Just a minute. Please tell me. Thanks. Thanks for everything. It's okay. The victim was strangled to death. Then a rock was used to disfigure the face. The body was set ablaze. If he was set ablaze when he was alive he would have inhaled the smoke. But there is no smell of smoke in the lungs. What was used to strangle the victim? Must be a cable or a wire. Look at the skull. It's completely smashed! It has been smashed in a way that it can't be reconstructed. He must be very strong. Otherwise, it's impossible to do this. Doctor. Can you tell us the date and time of death? February 6th. Between 8 to 9 in the night. Is it approximate? Accurate! Get me some coffee. - Okay, sir. Any leads, Karthikeyan? - Sir.. We cross-checked the fingerprints with the criminal records and we found no match. There is too much sugar.. - As per the forensic reports the corpse was set ablaze using petrol. - Sir. Everything has taken place in a hurried manner. The entire body wasn't doused in petrol which is why it is half burnt. Sir, it seems like an amateur killer. Yes, sir! We'll keep you posted. Sir! Sir. - Thank you Sir. A guest is missing from the Picnic Lodge near Central. But his luggage is still in the room. The lodge didn't file any missing complaint. We found out while inquiring. The missing guest's address shows that he is from Hyderabad. Where are you taking me? I asked you where you are taking me. Listen, if I don't like the place you are taking me then I will be pissed off! And if I get pissed off, our whole day will be spoiled. I hope you don't want that to happen. So, please tell me. Where are we going? Hey, I'm more concerned than you that this day shouldn't get ruined. So, don't worry about the place. I'm sure you'll like it. I will like it for sure. But I hate surprises. So, please tell me. Where are we going? This is the name and address of the guest. The entrance to reception and room are different. So, only if the guest drops off the room key with us we will know that he has stepped out. Okay. So, until what time was he in the room? Sir, we thought he was in the room till yesterday morning. But only in the evening we found out that he wasn't. Immediately, I asked his luggage to be removed from the room. I would like to see the CCTV footage. Sir, this hotel is exclusively for elite customers. So, we haven't installed CCTV cameras for their privacy. What's your name? - Vignesh, sir. Jagan. - Sir. Give me.. - Here - No, thank you, sir. Take it, man! What do they mean they haven't installed CCTV? - Unbelievable! You guys are too innocent. It seems, even the best hospital doesn't have CCTV. Didn't the people believe that? Yes, sir. We totally forgot about it. That's our fate! - Sir.. Just a minute. What? - The manager lied to you. Good boy. When I checked on February 6th, there was no one in the room. The business was dull, so he let the room be in the guest's name for as long as possible. The advance he paid got over yesterday. That's why he asked me to clear out the room. Please don't tell them that I revealed this to you. Shall I open the door, sir? - It's okay. No need. Jagan. - Sir.. Ask the forensic people to come. - Sure, sir. You may come in, sir. Okay. Let's get started, Muruganandam. Anything interesting? The corpse's fingerprint and the fingerprint from the hotel are a perfect match. We also got a hair sample from the hotel. It's a perfect DNA match with the corpse. The victim's name is Vamsi Kabirdas. The younger brother of a minister in Andhra Pradesh Mr. Sathyanarayanan Kabirdas. We inquired about the victim. He has a very bad name. For a long time, he had his eye set on the daughter of his brother's secretary. Her father handled things until the time he was alive. But after his death, he tortured her mom and her a lot. Unable to bear his torture, they moved to Chennai. He was searching for them for the past two years. Recently, he found out that they are here and he came to Chennai. And he has been murdered. Case of stalking, sir. We can nab the killer soon. Sathyanarayanan has already received the information. I have been requested to hand this case to my best officer. Vijaykumar. Distribute all the cases handled by Karthikeyan to others. I want his full attention on this case. Okay, sir. - And, sir. We have found out the whereabouts of that woman and her daughter. So I'll start my investigation from them. Who is Lakshmi? - That'd be me. We are coming from the police station. The inspector is here for an inquiry. Please come in. What happened, Mom? - They are from the police station. They want to do an inquiry. How long have you been staying here? Two years. Who all live here? Just my daughter and me. Your husband? Her father is no more. And your husband? What was his occupation? He was Minister Sathyanarayanan's personal secretary. At Hyderabad? Yes - So were you staying in Hyderabad earlier? Yes - What's your occupation? I don't work. My daughter's working. At Wonsoon. As a customer care executive. What was the reason for shifting from Hyderabad? Due to the minister's younger brother. I don't understand. We had to shift here because of Sathyanarayanan's brother, Vamsi. Why? He.. His character is not good. He came to our house often and misbehaved with us. We had to go through a lot of torture because of him. We couldn't seek anyone's help. So, we secretly moved to Chennai. Sir, what's the problem? May I know why we are being questioned? I'll tell you. But before that.. When and where did you see Vamsi last? It must be around two years ago. We haven't seen him ever since we came here. Really? Yes. Where were you both on February 6th and what were you doing? Feb 6th.. Last Thursday I had been to the office. When did you return? Evening around 6:30. Usually, the workload is more on Thursdays. My friend, Latha, had dropped me off. Can you recollect what you did after you arrived home? I didn't step out. We were at home. Okay. It's nothing.. Vamsi had come to Chennai looking for you. And he got murdered. Upon inquiring we got to know that his character was not good. Don't you worry. These are just basic formalities. I'll come and meet you if need be. Please cooperate. Are we done here? - Yes, sir. Thank you so much. Jagan. - Sir. Wait downstairs. I'll be back in five minutes. - Okay, sir. DCP Karthikeyan. Can I talk to you? Sorry to bother you. How well do you know the woman and her daughter living across? Not much. Whenever I see them, I smile. That's all. Apart from that, nothing much. Why do you ask? Well, it's related to an investigation. And on February, I think on the 6th.. Did you notice anything unusual? Define unusual. Any visitors they had, any noise, something like that. I usually return home at 6 p.m. after work. After that, I don't step out. So if they had any visitors when I wasn't home, I wouldn't know. And I didn't hear any unusual noise. Okay. Okay! Thank you so much. - Thank you. I believe they are telling the truth, sir. Sir, I don't think they both could have done this. First, cross-check and find out if that girl is speaking the truth. What is her friend's name? - Latha, sir. Latha. Inquire her. - Okay, sir. Hello. It's me, Prabhakaran. - Tell me. Did an inspector come to your house yesterday? Yes, he did. What did he ask you? He asked us exactly what you said he would. What was your reply? I told them exactly what you had asked me to tell. Do you think he believed it? That's how it appeared. Because after that, he didn't ask anything more. Is there anything else? What do you mean? Nothing. Don't worry. All these problems will come to an end soon. I will hang up now. Do you think he believed it? That's how it appeared. Because after that, he didn't ask anything more. Don't worry. All these problems will come to an end soon. 'Will all the problems truly come to an end?' 'Or am I giving them false hopes?' Why are you thinking too much? What did you ask? I asked why you are thinking too much. I trust you more than you trust yourself. Until you are here, nothing will happen to me. Got it? You are too good at reading my mind. I don't know about others. But I can read your mind very well. Do you really know me that well? "Come closer and let me feel that soft hug of yours." "Come closer and let me feel that soft love of yours." "Come closer and let me feel all of that softness in you." "Come closer and let me feel that soft hug of yours." "Come closer and let me feel that soft love of yours." "Come closer and with all your softness, make me feel alive." "Let me feel that soft kiss of yours." "Let's put an end to the shyness between us." "Do you hear my heart" "calling out your name?" "Come closer and let me feel that soft hug of yours." "Come closer and let me feel that soft love of yours." "Come closer and with all your softness, make me feel alive." "Every moment without you, burns me down slowly." "Come back to me and save me." "These sleepless, lonely nights are new to me." "Come back to me and make my nights worthy." "You're the glow in me" "that makes me shine like a star." "All my silence means is" "for us to unite once again." "I'm lost and struggling in an ocean of dreams." "Come back to me and save me." "There are millions of ways I would like to express my love." "Only if you could understand my loneliness." "We are one soul with two bodies." "I realise that now." "I know you are waiting for me." "I promise that I will shower all my love upon you." "Come closer and let me feel that soft hug of yours." "Come closer and let me feel that soft love of yours." "Come closer and with all your softness, make me feel alive." "Let me feel that soft kiss of yours." "Let's put an end to the shyness between us." "Do you hear my heart" "calling out your name?" Okay. Okay, hold it. Hold it tight. Okay? Call grandpa when the fish takes the bait. - Okay. So, is it only your doubt or everyone else in the team has the same doubt? Only I doubt it. Why didn't others have the same doubt? They think two ladies cannot commit such a murder. And again, the way they answered us didn't give rise to any suspicion. When did the murder take place? On February 6th, between 8 to 9 p.m. Where were those two ladies at that time? - They were at home. And that makes me suspect them even more. So, benefit of doubt? Isn't it? I understand it's a gruesome murder. Even I don't think they both would have committed it. They say that they moved places to keep away from him and did it without his knowledge. If they had committed that murder, they wouldn't have said so. Because then there would be a strong motive to commit the murder. Didn't it cross your mind? - Grandpa.. You got the catch! Good.. Sir, I've discussed many cases with you even after you got retired. But this is the first time you want to visit the crime scene. Why, sir? You strongly doubt the woman and her daughter. But I don't feel they would have done this. So, I shall investigate this case from my end. Most welcome, sir. And, sir. The corpse was found here. A local guy was crossing this route around 8:30 p.m. That's when he saw something was on fire as per his statement. The time quoted by him and that of the autopsy are in sync. So, the accused should have committed the murder before 9 p.m. and fled the place. Since it rained the previous night we couldn't find any clues in the ground. I don't see any link between the suspects and place of crime. Do you think two women could have committed this? Indeed that is impossible but someone could've helped them. A man? - Perhaps. Didn't you tell me that apart from them there is no one in their family? To lend such help, one must be a brother or a father. Why can't it be a lover? Not just that, the victim was strangled to death. Now, that can be done by two women. They could've executed it somewhere else and later shifted it here. Then they could've burnt it, right? Still, they would need someone's help to do that. I look at this as a well planned and executed murder. No, sir. I feel that the murderer is an amateur. How can you say that? They have tried hard to hide the identity of this corpse. But the evidence from the clothes and the fingerprints are enough to confirm the identity. These are the few things the criminal was totally unaware of. Sir, it's a call from that girl's office. He has a point. Sir.. That girl's friend, Latha, is back from her home town. We can go to meet her tomorrow. Sir, Vamsi's mobile signal was last found at Vyasarpadi on February 6th and then it went dead. Also, that girl's call records have been checked. She doesn't seem to talk to anyone regularly over the phone. She met a guy at the mall yesterday. He was her friend's boyfriend. How long has Ms. Dharini been working here? For the past two years, sir. Excuse me. Here she is. Please take your seat This is Latha, Dharini's team lead and her close friend. Hi, Latha. How are you? - I'm good. A few questions and then you may leave. No issues. - Good. Okay. On February 6th, you had dropped off Dharini after work. Is it true? Yes. Usually the workload is more on Thursdays and so we leave a little late. I drop her regularly. Does Dharini have any boyfriend? Boyfriend.. No, she doesn't have any boyfriend. She interacts and socialises with office colleagues. But again, she keeps a distance from everyone. Does she really not have a boyfriend? No. How can you be so confident? Any idea about this investigation? She told me that someone was murdered. Someone Dharini knew. His name is Vamsi. Didn't Dharini tell you anything about Vamsi? She did, but recently. Aren't you a very close friend of Dharini's? - Yes. And you say that she didn't tell about Vamsi until recently. Similarly, what if she is hiding about her boyfriend? I can empathise with her on why she didn't tell me about Vamsi. But if she has a boyfriend, I'm sure I'd have known about him. If she had a boyfriend, Roopa and I would know it for sure. Who is Roopa? So, even you don't think Dharini has a boyfriend? No, sir. In fact, I keep pulling her leg all the time. She won't even react to it. How do you pull her leg? There is a guy living across her house. He steps out exactly at the same time she leaves for office. Every single day! So, I keep pulling her leg saying that he is interested in her. But she never paid much heed to it. Prabhakaran. He works as a supervisor at Casa Grande. His work starts at 10 a.m. Then why does he come out when she leaves for work? That too, every single day. Definitely, there is some link between them. We didn't doubt it because they are neighbours. Just because both of them step out at the same time we cannot conclude that there is something between them. Even if they don't talk to each other while stepping out we can still find out if there is something between them. Sir, her office pick up is here. There she is, but what about him? Hi. The cab left but he isn't here yet. Sir, there! Sir, looks like he steps out every day to jog. Sir regarding Prabhakaran's details that you had asked for.. I was checking online. You just won't believe this! 'Contract killer, Aali, caught!' 'Aali was the primary accused in an MP's murder.' 'He was arrested by Prabhakaran IPS.' 'All the higher officials' 'appreciated him on achieving this feat.' "With God by his side, he is a one-man army!" "He wields a weapon like a warrior and fights courageously!" "With God by his side, he is a one-man army!" "He wields a weapon like a warrior and fights courageously!" Hello. Hello, sir - Tell me, Karthikeyan. You call only when you need something. Sir, how have you been? I'm fine. Come to the point. No formalities. Well, an IPS officer named Prabhakaran.. I guess he was in service two years ago. I just need some information about him. Give me two minutes and I will call you. Thank you, sir. Thank you so much. Sir! - Karthikeyan.. Officer Kola Venkat knows Prabhakaran very well. I'll send you his number. Talk to him. Okay, sir. - Kola Venkat here. Venkat, this is Karthikeyan from Chennai. How are you? - Yes, I'm fine, sir. Venkat, I would like to know about Mr. Prabhakaran. Mr. Prabhakaran isn't serving the department anymore. Fine, can you share some details about him? He is a mentor to everyone in our department here. Even today, we follow his footsteps on how to handle murder cases. All of a sudden, he resigned from the force. Truth be told the department still misses him. He is a mentor to everyone in our department here. Truth be told the department still misses him. "With God by his side, he is a one-man army!" "He wields a weapon like a warrior and fights courageously!" "With God by his side, he is a one-man army!" "He wields a weapon like a warrior and fights courageously!" "Eyes like an eagle and paws like the tiger." "Mess with him and he will knock you down." "Gangsters fear him and even the outlaws" "follow the rules when he is here." "He has a 'Never give up' attitude." "His hunting adventures never stop in the land of predators." "He always fights against injustice." "He never rests until justice is served." "With God by his side, he is a one-man army!" "He wields a weapon like a warrior and fights courageously!" "With God by his side, he is a one-man army!" "He wields a weapon like a warrior" "and fights courageously!" - Prabhakaran! Drop your weapon and proceed upstairs! Or else, I'll finish off your men! Prabhakaran! Now that you've finished off my men I will come back for revenge! I'll make you regret! There he is. - Thank you. - Thank you, sir. Hi. How are you? I'm fine. Well.. I had visited you two weeks ago, at your home. I hope you remember. Tell me. What is the matter? Nothing, just.. I came to know that you were serving the police force in Hyderabad until two years ago. So, I thought you would help me out. May I know how you came to know about me? I spoke to Kola Venkat. How can I help you? Dharini, open the door! We suspect the woman and her daughter. But we are unable to move the investigation any further. Since you live right across their house and I have heard that you have a strong investigative mind I thought you would share some information. What kind of information? - Anything. Anything at all. Anything that you'd have noticed by chance. Nothing of that sort. See, my point is if the woman and her daughter had committed the murder they couldn't have done it all by themselves. Someone must have helped them. If you had noticed someone visiting them or any description about them please tell me. If you doubt them so much you could try third-degree investigation, right? Or why don't you try the Truth Serum? Third-degree.. Well.. I suggested that since you asked for my help. I don't know what else to say. Excuse me. "He is an all-rounder, he is ferocious." "He pounces like a preying beast." "Obstacles don't bother him." "Even if it is the whole world against him" "he keeps advancing based on his instincts." "You can't hide from him. He'll nab you like an eagle nabs its prey." "He is daring enough to call out the lord of death for a face off." "With God by his side, he is a one-man army!" "He wields a weapon like a warrior and fights courageously!" "With God by his side, he is a one-man army!" "He wields a weapon like a warrior and fights courageously!" "With God by his side, he is a one-man army!" "He wields a weapon like a warrior and fights courageously!" I was discussing this with Jagan. I hope he must have told you. Regarding Prabhakaran, right? We don't know if there is any kind of contact between that girl and Prabhakaran. But he has followed her everywhere. Sir, he is an ex-cop. Quite intelligent. He very well knows how we'll perceive things and what problems can come up. Except for the fact that he followed that girl everywhere he hasn't established any other kind of contact between himself and that girl. Sir, if Prabhakaran had really helped them then how could he make such silly mistakes? We got evidence from the clothes and the corpse's fingerprints. He couldn't have been so careless. So do you strongly believe that it's Prabhakaran who helped the woman and her daughter? Don't you feel so? Well, if Dharini had any kind of contact with Prabhakaran then why would he follow her? That piece doesn't seem to fit in the puzzle. Mr. Prabhakaran. If you're looking for my help then I'm sorry. I'm not interested in helping you in this matter. Moreover, I don't know anything else. I'm not here for your help. I know you don't like helping others. I came to tell you something. The first murder case I handled after joining the department.. I solved it in a jiffy. It was the situation that made the murderer commit the murder. He had a beautiful wife and a two-year-old child. He had a happy family. But the guy who died was not a good person. He was a seasoned criminal. After solving the case, I was in a small dilemma. That is, the murderer was not a professional killer. So, there is no chance that he would repeat the same. What would happen to his family if I put him behind the bars? Should I arrest him or forgive and let him go free? Fine, for a second I thought I'd forgive him and let him go. But within a week, I realised something. Everyone who commits such crimes will have a justification for it. And if officers like me think of forgiving such criminals then most of the murderers will be roaming free. So, I came to a conclusion. I didn't want to re-write the law and order. It's already written. According to the law, murder is a serious crime. I put him behind bars. He is still in prison. I hope you understand why I am telling you this. Do you have anything else to say? I am done. We are here to meet the inspector. - Please wait. Inform them once the inspector is here. - Okay. Sir, how may I help you? Why do you get into such a mess at this young age? I have committed a murder. I am turning myself in. Sir, Prabhakaran has turned himself in at R1 police station. We haven't taken down his confession statement yet. The ADGP wants you here immediately. Sir, he doesn't look like a killer. Dharini is my girlfriend. Dharini and I are lovers. But except Dharini and myself, no one else knows about it. Because that's how Dharini wanted to keep it. We won't meet often. We talk a lot over the phone. I don't understand one thing. I wonder why Dharini wanted this relationship to be a secret. The thing is.. Dharini doesn't trust anyone so easily. Even though, she said that she loves me only after she trusted me completely she told me about Vamsi. Vamsi had made her life a living hell. The fear that she had for Vamsi.. Later, I got to know how badly she was affected. I am ready to do anything for my beloved Dharini. But.. I couldn't find a way to get rid of her fear. On February 6th, Vamsi came looking for Dharini. Do you know in which apartment does Dharini stay? I hadn't seen Vamsi before. But it was quite easy for me to recognise that he was Vamsi. Dharini? It's been a while since they moved to another place. There is no need for him to doubt me. At the same time, he didn't have to trust me either. If he inquires someone else there he'll find out that Dharini still resides there. In order to prevent that from happening I must make him trust me. And make him leave from there at once. My mind started working faster. How come you don't know that she has moved? So, if I start asking him questions then instead of doubting me he will get into a defensive mode to prevent me from doubting him. He reacted exactly I expected him to. - I know her from Hyderabad. After she moved to Chennai this is the only addressed I had. It's been long since I spoke to her. That interval was all I needed to plan what I should tell him next. They moved to Vyasarpadi. I'll tell you the address. Note it down. It's quite far from here. She'll be home by 7 p.m. - Okay. It'll take that long for her to come back from work. Take down my number. If you can't find her house, call me. Nice. - It was I who helped them a lot while shifting. Mention my name and she'll know. For sure! - Number? My primary aim was to chase Vamsi away from there. But in order to get rid of Dharini's fear of Vamsi he must not exist at all. This idea struck me a little late. So, I chose a perfect place to execute Vamsi and gave him this address. I was well prepared. I reached before him and was waiting for him. Vamsi did exactly what I expected him to do. That is, instead of going straight to the address that I gave him he would observe from a distance to confirm if Dharini was really living there. Disposing of the body was difficult. Instead, I thought disfiguring his face would be the best way out. I smashed his face repeatedly with a rock. I smashed it to the extent that I lost the count. But every time I smashed I was relieved that Dharini would live happily hereafter. Everything was executed perfectly. I returned home, thinking no one will ever crack the case. I didn't want Dharini to find out about this. But your suspicion.. It fell on Dharini and her mother. I did this to save someone but when she got trapped in another problem I felt that turning myself in was the best option. One coffee. Sir, he has confessed to the murder. I had a doubt on him. But I never expected them to be in a relationship. I am not sure, sir. Karthikeyan are you on your way to question that woman and her daughter? Yes, sir. - Don't handle them roughly. Go a little easy on them. Jagan and Murali. - Sir. Go to Prabhakaran's house. - Okay, sir. Rest of you, come with me. - Okay, sir. What is the relationship between you and Prabhakaran? I don't understand. Prabhakaran has turned himself in. He said that he is in a relationship with you. He has confessed that he murdered Vamsi for you. Me! Are we in a relationship? I have hardly spoken to him, sir. I see him every day when I leave for work. We exchange a casual smile and greetings. Apart from that, we haven't spoken at all. Moreover he claims to have called you often from his landline phone. We traced all his call logs. And you have been receiving regular calls from his number. Those anonymous calls.. We had no idea who was making those calls. We keep receiving calls regularly. If we attend it, there'll be no response from the other end. Once we hang up we keep getting repeated calls. At times, we just leave the receiver away from the phone. We have enough problems already. I didn't want to make an issue out of those anonymous calls. We never told or discussed with anyone about those calls. Wait.. You claim to have no relationship with Prabhakaran. You never knew who made those calls. Then in that case how did Prabhakaran come to know about the issue between you and Vamsi? Well.. Even we have no idea about it. Sir. Just a minute. Did she claim to have no relationship with him? Yes. Did they say that they keep getting anonymous calls? Yes. How do you know this? Sir, have a look at this. What's that? What's this? - Sir. I was listening to everything that was going on over there. Is it? - Yes, sir. Sir. Sir, now I am in the hall of that lady's house. Now, from the hall I am moving to their TV room. Moving on from the TV room to their bedroom. Now I'm in their bedroom, sir. Now again, I'm moving from the bedroom to the hall. Moving into the kitchen. Now I'm in the kitchen, sir. Okay. He must be a psychopath, sir. When you told me that he claimed they were lovers I felt that there was no possibility for it. Will that girl confirm the same? That you both are in a relationship. What's there to confirm it? Of course, we are lovers. How long have you both been in this relationship? I'll like the place for sure, but I hate surprises. So, please tell me. Where are we going? I like you a lot. I know you like me too. But we never uttered a word about it so far. I cannot keep it from you anymore. I would like to marry you. She didn't give me a reply. But it was after that we both became very close and attached. It was only after she started trusting me completely she slowly told me everything about Vamsi. I kept worrying about her all the time. Even without telling her she found out that I was worried about her. I guess she actually liked it. Do you really know me that well? I love you. She isn't like any other ordinary girl. But she confessed her love for me. So, imagine the love she would've had for me. Imagine the trust she would've had on me. In order to save her not just one murder I'm ready to commit any number of murders. Dharini's happiness means a lot to me. He is highly delusional. All that he is saying is a part of his imagination. I couldn't make him understand that it's not the reality. Such patients behave quite normal. But his actions are extremely dangerous. Like you just saw. I recommend immediate treatment. Still, he is very dangerous. Get the papers ready and I will sign it. Excuse me. - Yes, sir. His actions and on contrast, his deep silence.. Very weird. Karthikeyan. Sir. - I think the case is closed. Who is it? - The EB guy, ma'am! The case isn't closed yet, sir. Could it be him? I don't know. But I escaped without his notice. Who is it? The EB guy, ma'am! Mom! You wretch! How dare you! You thought you could escape from me! If I cannot have you then no one must have you! Oh, no! Let go of her! Leave her! Oh, no! Let go of her! I said, let go of her! How dare you escape! Die! Die! Oh, no! You want to run away from me, is it? How dare you! Dharini! Let go of me! Leave me, Dharini! Leave me! Who is it? - It's me, Prabhakaran. Your neighbour. Please open the door. What do you want? I heard some noise. Any problem? N.. No.. A rat. My mom screamed out of fear on seeing it. That's it. Have you killed? Did you kill the rat? No, it escaped. It's not a big deal. Thank you. Fine, okay. Hello. It's me, Prabhakaran. I live across. Do you think both of you can dispose of the corpse all by yourselves? Don't worry. No problem. I'll hang up and talk to you in person. Do you hear everything that goes on here? I heard a heavy noise. So, I came and knocked on your door. When you opened the door the chain on the door was cut and you looked very scared. When I peeped in I saw two feet. If someone was hiding in here there was no need for him to lie down here. Based on what I saw and heard I predicted that this would've happened. My prediction was correct. What are you going to do next? I'll turn myself in. I killed him. I'll turn myself in. - Mom, what are you saying? You're innocent. - Dharini, shut up! I committed this murder to save my daughter. I shall turn in. One person couldn't have done it all alone. The police won't believe if you say that you did it all by yourself. They will arrest her too. - Oh, no! My daughter's life must not get affected. I.. What should I do? It's your wish to turn yourself in. But if you want to escape then this corpse must be disposed of. You cannot do it yourselves. You need help. I shall help you. But I need to know who he is, what the problem between you two is and why he came here. Do as I ask you to. You believe this is what happened, right? No, sir. This is what exactly happened. - No, Karthikeyan. That's your assumption. You don't have evidence to back up your theory. But I have the evidence to prove it otherwise. What evidence do you have? According to the autopsy report the murder took place between 8 and 9 p.m. Nothing is wrong there. Do you agree that the doctor's certificate is correct? Sir. Then whatever you said must have taken place in her house between 8 and 9 p.m. Isn't it? Yes, sir. It must take an hour to reach Vyasarpadi road from her house. That time can increase during peak hours. I found out where they were when the murder took place. The girl has called for drinking water can at 7:30 p.m. Upon tracing the call using the mobile tower it was near Anj Vilaku, at Mambalam. The guy who answered was in the same area too. When that guy came to their house to deliver the water can the time was 8:20 p.m. That guy's statement is another proof that the woman and her daughter were at home. If the incident had happened after the guy left then they must have gone to Vyasarpadi after killing him. A guy who crossed that spot around 9 p.m. saw something was burning on the road and you are the one who told me this. In that case do you think it is possible to kill Vamsi and burn him at that spot within 30 minutes? Impossible. The woman and her daughter are not murderers. It's indeed Prabhakaran. You are not agreeing to this. How could they have done it with so many evidence pointing towards him? Answer me. According to the autopsy report the murder took place in between 8 and 9 p.m. When that guy came to their house to deliver the water can the time was 8:20 p.m. That guy's statement is another proof that the woman and her daughter were at home. Do you think it is possible to kill Vamsi and burn him at that spot within 30 minutes? The woman and her daughter are not murderers. It's indeed Prabhakaran. "He is a murderer." "He is a murderer." Mr. Prabhakaran didn't come to work on February 5th and 6th. Thank you. - It's okay. "A murderer!" I'm ready to commit any number of murders. Dharini's happiness means a lot to me. Did he want us to identify Vamsi's corpse? How does he benefit from it? I don't know, sir. But one thing, sir. If he really didn't want us to crack the case he wouldn't have been so careless to leave the fingerprints and the clothes as clues. Only flowers? Don't you want sweets? I will buy everything, dear. Don't you sleep off after having food. Wait for me. I thought it was my phone, but it's yours. So, whom were you talking to all this while? Of course, I was talking to your wife. Jagan! - Sir. I need all the newspapers from February 6th to 20th. - Yes, sir. Kola Venkat, I want Prabhakaran's family details. Sir, the case is closed. Do you believe at least now that Prabhakaran is the murderer? Everyone said that you are the murderer. Only I believed that you didn't murder or were delusional. I said that you were making a fool out of everyone. But in the end you made me look like a bigger fool. Because you did the murder. That's what we had been saying since the beginning. That he is the murderer. Just because Prabhakaran committed a murder doesn't mean that the woman and daughter didn't commit any murder. Even they have committed a murder. I don't get it. I checked all the case records when you were in the department. Out of 45 cases, 34 were unsolved. You earned a name as an able officer. Yet, how come you have such a poor track record? I inquired Kola. So many unsolved cases. How? It's unsolved only as per the records. You don't know about Mr. Prabhakaran. He doesn't follow the law and order. He has his own laws. He won't arrest a criminal immediately after he finds him. He'll first find out why that person committed the crime. If he feels there is justice in it, he'll warn and let him go. But he'll always have an eye on that criminal. He doesn't care about the track record. If a chance is all one needs to reform he will give him that chance. The Prabhakaran that Kola Venkat defined and the Prabhakaran who asked me to investigate the woman and her daughter using the third-degree had a vast difference. That's when I made up my mind that you are involved in this murder. But I didn't know how and to what extent. The moment you turned yourself in and confessed to committing this murder that's when I confirmed it. That it was that woman and her daughter who committed this murder and not you. But his confession statement and the modus operandi of the murder are in sync. No, sir. If Dharini had told Prabhakaran about Vamsi and asked for his help he wouldn't have suggested murder as an option. Then how did the murder take place? This is how.. The murder took place before Prabhakaran got involved in it. So, they didn't have any other option but to hide it. Karthikeyan, first you said Prabhakaran committed the murder. Now, you say it's the woman and daughter. What are you blabbering? They both have done it, sir. But Vamsi was murdered by that woman and her daughter. You are confusing me! You've lost! Why don't you accept it? Moreover, on February 6th, the day of the murder that woman and daughter were at home between 8 and 9 p.m. Nothing happened there and there is strong evidence. Explain that! I'll tell you. The murder wasn't committed on Feb 6th. It was on Feb 4th. - What? You had planned it brilliantly. The evidence from the murder site that is the fingerprints and the tailor label.. All these days, I believed it was a mistake from the murderer's end. But recently, I found out that they were left there as a part of the plan. On February 4th, the woman and her daughter murdered Vamsi. On Feb 6th, you had committed another murder. And that's the corpse. We all believed that it was Vamsi's corpse based on the evidence you left behind. What about Vamsi's corpse? What did you do with Vamsi's body? You disposed it in the outskirts of the city. That comes under a different jurisdiction. Hence, it was not linked up to this case. Apart from that, no one noticed it as it came as a very small article in the newspapers. If Vamsi's corpse could have been easily disposed why commit another murder? To trick the police! Vamsi is a minister's brother. The minister won't rest when he finds out his brother is missing. He'll search until he finds him. So, the case will never close. And at some breaking point during the investigation that woman and her daughter would have confessed Vamsi's visit and the incident. So, Prabhakaran wanted to save the woman and her daughter and close this case. Hence, the second murder. And that is the intelligence of Prabhakaran. So, did he do all this just for the love he had for that girl? That too, for a one-sided love? You have no relationship with that girl. Then why did you take such a big risk for her? You have committed another murder for her. Whom did you murder? Only you have the answers to these two questions. But you aren't going to agree to anything I just said. As far as I'm concerned I don't see any light in this case. It's a dead end. Didn't he react at all for whatever you said? Sir, he didn't expect that I'd come this far in the case. If I had cracked it, I think he knows what to do. There is no use proceeding further. Case closed. Sir! - Yes! You have no relationship with that girl. Then why did you take such a big risk for her? Why must you turn yourself in for my sake? You have committed another murder for her. Whom did you murder? You have no relationship with that girl. You have committed another murder for her. Why must you turn yourself in for my sake? I won't agree with it. I need to have a word with you. I am going to turn myself in. But.. Didn't you say that no problems would arise and it would be easy to get out of this? No. Everything is happening as per the plan. If you have to turn yourself in to save us then I won't allow it to happen. We will turn ourselves in. Dharini. Listen to me. I'm not turning myself in for the murder you guys committed. I have also committed a murder. Do you remember the time I saw you first? Sorry. We just moved into the opposite flat. We have two huge luggage. My daughterand I aren't able to lift it. Can you please help us? Sure. Come on. That was the first time I saw you. But I have seen someone who looks exactly like you. I knew her. We lived a life together. Will you marry me? I promise I'll take care of you. Yes. - Really? I love you, Aaradhana. I love you too. 'Aali, head of a famous gang' 'had murdered the ruling party MLA, B L Reddy and got arrested.' 'Reports say that he escaped from the prison last night.' 'Four officers, who were on duty have been suspended.' 'Prabhakaran IPS' 'was the main officer who led the mission while nabbing Aali.' 'Police sources say that Aali had escaped' 'from prison with the intention to take revenge.' 'Hence, the security has been tightened at Prabhakaran's house.' 'Aali is a prime accused in many murder cases.' Why are you thinking too much? Do you think that he'll end up harming me to take revenge on you? Nothing will happen to me until you are with me. "You are the soul that is filled in me in the form of love." Really? I trust you more than you trust yourself. Got it? Hey! What's your problem? All the doors are locked. Don't you get scared and scare me in turn. If you are so concerned, you could've reached home soon, right? I am Prabhakaran's wife. Who'd have the guts to attack me? Aaradhana? Aaradhana? Aaradhana! "You are the soul that is filled in me in the form of love." "You now live in my memories and in the form of pain." Every day, when you leave for work I also step out for this reason. You look exactly like her and every time I look at you I feel like I'm looking at her. I was on the hunt to avenge her death by killing her murderer. Tell me, where is he? - If I say that, he'll kill me. If you don't say, I'll kill you! Now, speak up! Tell me! Where is Aali? Speak up! Where is Aali? Aali.. Aali is in Chennai! I took my revenge on him. I used that murder to save you. The murder you committed was an act of self-defence. What I did was the vengeance to take revenge. There is nothing wrong with me turning myself in. I would've turned myself in without telling you all this. But I don't want you to live a life filled with guilt. That is why I'm telling you this. You must do me a huge favour. When the police come and question you tell them what I tell you. I have accordingly set up a few evidence. I couldn't save my beloved Aaradhana. Turning myself in for you is something I choose to do. I need this. Please. You have no relationship with that girl. Then why did you take such a big risk for her? You committed another murder for her. Whom did you murder? Prabhakaran, if I can find out so much do you think I wouldn't have found the answers to these questions too? The sacrifice that you have made for that woman and her daughter is a great deed. It shows that you are not just a good police officer but also a good human being. I respect that. As far as the department is concerned, let my findings remain a mystery. I won this battle as a police officer. But in the name of humanity you have won! Salute! "He is a murderer." "He is a murderer." "A murderer!" "A murderer."
