THREE LETTERS NAMES OF SOME CHARACTERS IN THIS FILM DUE TO LEGAL REQUIREMENTS I think you are serious with this girl. It looks like that for now. It's been three weeks, though, as if we've been meeting for 10 years. Looks like a good girl. - He liked the desire very much. I noticed him. Their heads sat down. The nation, my son, fuses right away. They even started gossiping while we were away. By the way, I like the house very much. Very nice. The text comes here every two to three months. What a pity. Just because they will be excited ... ...animals become their souls. Salih had never told me about curiosity. The text got him used to. Salih is the newest hunter. Salih. Will you start working immediately? I will start, where will I find a job, son? - We don't have a family company like you, son. - Boy, do you have me? Let me start working, I will not stay for a month or two, take you with me. The responsibility of the big company is already up to me. How can I manage it on my own? Thank you, Metin. My son is most happy for my mother. Since elementary school, "My son will be an engineer." He would keep saying. Mothers are important, of course. Fuck. Are you idiot, son? Take care. It happened when my son was taking this. Pay attention to that safety. So, when is the wedding fortune? Actually this was going to happen, but ... ...we lost the father of Metin. So we had to postpone it. My condolences. Thanks. We always talked about me. Tell me a little bit. How did you meet Salih? I liked one or two photos he shared. Then he followed. We met like that. So you took the first step? It was a little like that, yes. Do you believe in fortunes? Look at you that way. I will go like this. -OK. - Take care, don't have an injury. -Okay okay. Look, the heart begins under the ring finger. This shows that you are in love easily. This life, this is destiny. Those who have a long life line say they live long. Look, this is a bidirectional line of fate. This is for your own happiness ... means you are a person who can easily change your life. AFTER 5 MONTHS I went shopping today. I bought a few things for mom's invitation. You're exaggerating, Şermin. We are not going to the fashion show. The meal is after all. How do you think? Not too exaggerated, right? Sermin has 10 more days. What is this of you in a hurry, I do not understand. Mon dear for ten days. So what? Here is Metin, when Salih accidentally shot himself ... thought he was dead. When the cops came, they understood. Turns out she was alive. It's terrible. Then the text left you and became with Salih's girlfriend, huh? He got engaged. I will ask something. Did you meet this girl? We met the day before the incident. He told Salih that he was in love like crazy. It's really interesting. What happened then? Here we went to the police and the court together. They were sincere at that time, hidden from me. Even one month after the event ... ...they started to be together. Oh, now. Come on, I can't say anything to the girl. The girl bitch is obviously. But your fiancee? Come on, he doesn't have respect for you ... Doesn't he respect his friend who was injured? You don't know people. But this will happen to you. I have had nervous breakdowns for months. I live with pills. That's how people become murderers. Pain is coming into my brain from thinking now. Look. It's been four months. I settled in my mother's old house. I couldn't even arrange for myself. Is it easy? What happens to you even when you leave your human beloved? ...very annoying. What does Salih do? Are they going to visit him? Did you see? They all forgot. It hasn't even been five months yet. They forgot. You know, the best doctors would have you operated? It's all lies. They all turned out to be liars. What happened to my poor puppy. They came, they cried here, they whined. They shed tears from lies. What happened then? All fell into their own troubles. They left my baby crippled. Alone with the rootstock. But from those who did this to you ... ...I will bring wick from the nose of all those who left you alone on this difficult day. You will see. Your mother will punish them all. They will also experience the hell you live. God help me my baby. My life I'll ask something. Did your mother invite Arzu to dinner? Sir Aziz? Metin Bey disturbed. They came to the demolition from the municipality, sir. If you come here. What destruction Aziz at this hour? What was the problem? I don't know, sir. You better come. We can't figure it out. Okay Aziz, okay. I'm leaving now. Aziz from the workplace. There was a problem. What problem is this, evening and evening? I do not know, Şermin did not say. I'll be right back. If you stayed tonight. Either my mom makes a definite event. "You've already come for two days, and you're staying with your friend." He says now. Otherwise I would love it, you know. I missed you. Good thing you came. I missed you too. Have a good trip. Thanks. Good trip to you, little one. Say hi to your wife too. - We haven't met yet, but .. - Tell me, dear. - See you. -Goodnight. Here's Metin Bey. Aziz I came, no one is here. Pardon Metin Bey, where did you go? Aziz just called or said "You have to come urgently." He said. I did not call you Metin Bey. Aziz, are you kidding me? Who called you if you didn't? I do not know. I didn't call, sir. Hello. Saint. God damn you, Aziz. What the hell are you doing again? Khalil! Ismet. Son, who's there? Give a sound. Let me fuck your job. Work. I fuck you. Son, where does this sound come from? Are you kidding me? Khalil. Khalil. Help me. Fuck. Who is there? Help me. Help me. Are you okay? What happens? Be completely calm. I'm opening. - Help me. - Are you okay? Help me. Calm down. Did you see? Your friend Salih ... ...lives like you because of you. He lives like you because of you. He lives like you because of you. Look at this house. He left you alone. They never stop, look for months. Come, son, come. We take care of ourselves. They left you in the middle. Who is it? Text's fiancee. You got sick like this because of them. None of them would have happened if they hadn't taken you there. All of them will be punished. Do not worry. Your mother will punish them all. Not hungry. It looks through the hole but does not open. He doesn't want to open the door. He knows your crime. That's why it doesn't open. He knows what happens when he opens it. He thinks we don't understand. We know you're at home. Who are you? Let's go, son. We'll come again later. You left my son like this! My son suffered. Because of you. Look! Look! Look! Text? Şermin, we came. Come on down. We are waiting for you. The Şermin. Come on. Text? Why did you go like that? What happened? - Nothing. Have you had a dream? When did you come? It's been five minutes. I didn't want to wake up. Text. Sir dear? How is Salih? I do not know. So does he remember what happened? Or does it feel? I don't know, Şermin. I don't want to learn either. Close this thread. How many times did we talk? Sometimes "I wish he had died in that accident." I say. What is the point of living like this? Close your sherm, please. There is something that bothers me. Even though I don't want to think about it, it always comes into my dreams. Salih is no more, Şermin. No matter whether we think about it or not. What are you trying to do by opening this subject every time? - I do not understand you. What do I mean, what am I trying to do? I just want to talk to you. Is there anyone else to talk to? Did you think me idiot? You still think of it. You can not forget. This is all I understand from this conversation. Nonsense Text. What do you mean "You still think of him?" Does your ear hear from your mouth? I'm just suffering remorse. So. Remorseful? You or me? You don't understand me, Şermin. Salih is my 12 year old friend. Just because we are with you now ... ...I feel so guilty. But I try to forget this and what happened. I don't want to think about Salih before marriage. Because if it heals now ... ...if he gets out of bed and spits on my face ... I don't have a word to tell him, Şermin. Is it like me? I feel guilty too. Let's feel how we feel. We will never change these things, Şermin. So let's close this issue now. I think he doesn't feel and remember anything. It is best for both of us to think so. Come. You Czech. You will all suffer, one by one. You Czech. I came to buy my remaining items. Did you talk to Metin? We are not talking to Metin. I will take my things and go. You can't enter the text while you're not at home. Sorry. Well, call me then. I can not call. So busy. Look. I don't have a problem to make a problem. I will take my things and go. You can't go inside. I can never deal with you, honey. Let's. What kind of trouble are you? Look at you. You're not ashamed, are you? If you have any problems, do it yourself with Metin, okay? When you have Text to get your belongings, you will come home. Let's. Don't be rude. I'm not doing naughty stuff. Pull your foot. I will close the door. Pu God damn you. Bitch. Idiot loser. Silly. Welcome to Metin Bey. - Call me, call me Aziz. -Of course sir. Welcome, Metin Bey. - I found it nice, Aziz. -You called me. Sorry for what happened yesterday. I missed alcohol a little too much. I didn't know what I said on the phone. Estağfurullah Metin Bey. Okay, come on, nothing else. I called to say this. Good day Sir. Oh, Aziz. Look.

Not bad. How are you? No, what happened? We need to talk, Metin. OK. I am listening to you. It's not something to talk about on the phone. I'm not good at the moment. We need to talk face to face. Ok, I'll arrange it tomorrow. I'll let you know. OK. Ll see. Amine. He was a very clean-faced boy. How is it? He accidentally shot himself. Nonsense in his head. Doctors couldn't take it off. The surgery was very dangerous. Pity. - Allah save him. -Amine. Have you read? - We read it, sister. -God bless you. Thanks. Thank you dear. Hatice. Is that the man you said will not come in the evening? The future sister. I spoke, don't worry. He said I would bring the night, but he said he would come late. It does not matter late or early.

Where are you, Nazar? Evil eye? You forgot me. You would help? My daughter, your bird is here. He did not escape. I bought it from your house. Did Arzu call you today? Yoo. Why are you between? He came to take his things. "You can't go inside." I said. What item does he have here? I mean, let me know, dear. It has a two piece thing. Why did you stretch it? I wish you were. Do you think it is normal Metin, come like that because of pat? Without notice. I'm nervous. No, I don't understand why? So... ...I do not know. We never spoke after leaving, but ... I didn't understand why. OK. "You can't enter text when you're not at home." I said. If he calls you, be aware. OK. Good thing you came Thanksgiving. You said don't come but I couldn't bear it. I think of these drugs. I started to see ridiculous dreams. I'm afraid to be alone now at home. It's easy to say but if you don't use it anymore? I'll leave. I hope I will quit. Text. Why did you leave Arzu and be with me Metin? Why did you leave Arzu and be with me Metin? Salih is very angry with us Metin. Salih's mother cast a spell on us Metin. Salih is now with me in the room. Text? The Şermin. What's going on with us, Şermin? Here you are. Sir, come on. Welcome. Türkan sister, I brought Nesret Hodja, which I mentioned to you. Thank you, Hatice. God bless you. Where? Above. You go now. Thank you, Hatice. Thank you dear. Here you go. This job is very dangerous. Are you ready for this? You are responsible for this job. I will only show you how to do this job. If you get caught, you won't know me if you get into trouble. OK. Okay, teacher. This is not magic. It's not black magic. Red is not magic. Nobody believes this. But those who live do. Your son will also experience this. Thank you, sir. Did Hatice tell you about the cost of this work? It had. Here you are. Okay, right? OK. In your son's dreams and dreams ... ...will live what you want. He will marry if you want. It will have a child if you want. Just tell them what you want him to live. However, this job is not that easy. I need a vow for this job. I will tell you everything. My daughter. My house is over there. Can you help me I brought your things. Are you happy? I don't want to talk about this. There are things that do not bother me Metin. I want to talk. Desire, look. I told you before. What pattern, what you do are right. I have nothing to say to you. It doesn't matter whether I'm right or wrong. There are things I want to learn. And I will not be good without learning. OK. I'm listening. Tell me. A five and a half year relationship ... ...how does it end in a moment? Desire, as I said, has nothing to do with you. What does it mean, "It has nothing to do with you"? Who has nothing to do with me? Did you fall in love at first sight? Salih's situation made us very sad. You know it, too. He never left me alone. Do you help Salih Metin? I was wondering. I was actually. But then we talked to Şermin ... ...and we decided that I shouldn't help. Why? Because this situation made me feel very guilty. And so long as we don't take Salih out of our lives. We couldn't be happy. I have never heard anything more ridiculous in my life. Text. He was your best friend. He needs the money you send. Can not you see? Desire. It was an accident. I had no crime. Don't act like I hit the man. Salih is my 12 year old friend. It was very difficult for me to get over this event anyway. You know it, too. We thought and decided not to go. This much. I have nightmares at night, Metin. How can you sleep when I can't even sleep easily? Shame on you. I used to clean every day. But now I'm old girl. I can not. Good thing I found you girl. Health to your hands. Everywhere was immaculate. You're tired, baby. Let me brew a tea. We drink together. You rest too, will you? OK, sister. Good. Okay then. Don't let your knees cross your toes. A little more in the waist pit. - Is it okay? -Is happening. Slowly. Bend, bend, bend. I'm tired but it was worth it. Thank you. I saw you here for the first time. Yo, I'm actually coming, but ... - ...that means we didn't come across. -I am here during the week. OK. Then I'm going. - See you. See you, Gökhan. Goddamn woman. He lives in my house. He took my house. He also took the man I loved. When Salih is crippled ... ...Metin approached Metin because he was rich. Look, I'm calling, not on my phone. Has it closed? He hung up. Maybe he saw me. How will he see? Shall we get out of here? Stop. Wait a bit. Did he see me? I see. What will he do? To go. Will it run away? Wondering. He was very scared. Look, it will come out of this book. I'm sorry if I see him. My daughter open your eyes. My hungry girl. Dead. Fuck. Text. I'm inside your brain, Metin. I'm inside your brain. I'm inside your brain, Metin. I'm inside your brain, Metin. Come on. Salih. Text. You're all alone, Metin. You're all alone, Metin. Save your collar. It's too late. You left me alone. Save yourself. Save yourself. I'm inside your brain, Metin. I'm inside your brain. Save yourself. Save yourself. Salih. Text was accident. You have no crime. Look, have you seen? My son can't walk. She's been in a wheelchair, baby. Desire cannot act like him. It was just like Salih. He can't move. Why can't she stand, Aunt, Salih? Salih accidentally shot himself. All nonsense came into his brain. So it was paralyzed. Desire cannot act like him. Look, look there. Remember. He looks at us. Text, bring Arzu. He can't come. Go get him. Go get it. Text will help you Arzu. Do not worry. Go get him. Bring it. You need to drink these drugs, Arzu. Salih. When you bring the text, you give these drugs to Arzu. He is very upset. Pity. My son shot himself. I'm still in Zeynep. I will stay here. See you in the morning. ARROW. There are ... ...but you are not. I'm inside your brain. I'm inside your brain, Metin. I'm in your brain. Let's face it. If you do not go, I will go crazy, Salih. Or am I crazy? Come Text. You know where to come. Only you didn't lose, Salih. I lost it too. You are trapped in your body. I... I... I'm imprisoned in my soul, righteous. I'm inside your brain. I'm inside your brain. I'm inside your brain. Come on. Help me, Salih. Help me, Salih. Help me, Salih. You're fine, Metin. You're good. You're fine, you're fine. You're good. Did you do what I said exactly as I said? I did. I did but it didn't. They may not want the voting, they may not like it. Think of it like a baby you want to be born with. You will continue until you find the right devotee. But if your son doesn't want what you do ... never continue. This annoys them. Yo, my son wants it. The girl didn't understand what happened? No. He did not understand. When he got sober, he didn't remember anything. Be careful with these things. It wouldn't be good if he told others. Hello Türkan sister. Welcome. Come on, late. How is Salih, sister Türkan? How come girl? As you can see, here it is. I hope it will be fine. I do my best to be good. I saw you in my dream last night. What's up? Why did the text not come? You have never been through. I also wanted to talk to you about this. Will you come out with me for a minute? OK, girl. Come. Come sit. I wondered. Let me see what you will tell. We broke up with Metin. What? It's been four months. Why did you break up? Metin and Şermin are engaged. Salih loved them very much. Good thing you didn't say it inside. He would be sad, baby. I would not be comfortable if I did not tell. You did well, girl. I had never seen that girl anyway. You go now sit next to Salih. I am coming right now. Come on girl. I will stop by Salih today. OK. What will I ask you sister? I found this in the garbage bag in front of the door, but ... ...I do not understand. You sent me the last day images of Salih by phone. Yes? I pressed them to keep a memory. Then I ripped it so I couldn't stand to see it. Understood. I'm inside your brain, Metin. I'm inside your brain, Metin. I'm inside your brain, Metin. Come on. Come on. Let's face it. I'm not here, Metin. I'm waiting for you where I was shot. I'm waiting for you where I was shot. I'm waiting for you where I was shot. You can't take me out. You can't take me out. You can't get me out of the text. You can't get me out of here. You Çıkartamaz. Come on. Come Text. Come Text. You know where to come. You know where to go. - Welcome, mom. -We found it nice, girl. - Kiss, don't kiss. I am sick. -Get well soon. Why are you late? I couldn't find a car. They don't want to come here at this time. I was just calling you, "I'm not coming." Someone stopped. Why didn't they want to come? - How can I know? - Late, late mother. What does the text do? Well, what do you do? A little work has gone on today. I said I'll call you when you're not at home. How was Salih? Do you get news? Pity. I feel very sorry for that child. I wish you would stop by occasionally, girl. I'll go to a sink. Ok mom Mom? Mom? Salih's mother learned that you are engaged with Metin. My daughter if you hadn't done anything like her with her best friend. Your heart is black with evil. That's how your mother gave your punishment. His heart is black like yours. It's full of evil. MY MOTHER Salih. You accidentally hit Metin. You have no crime. Salih started talking two months after that night. Fuck. Fuck. I ate shit. I ate shit. I ate shit. I ate shit. Uncle. Uncle. Uncle. Uncle, get up. Uncle. Uncle. Uncle. Get up. - Text. -Uncle. Uncle, get up. What happened to the text? Son, what happened? I shot him. What are you saying son? How did you hit it? Uncle. Uncle, get up. Text. Son, this man is dead. Uncle. Uncle, get up. - What are you doing? - Boy, I'll let you know. Let's call for help. - To the gendarmerie ... - Who will you inform? What are we going to say? Are you crazy? Don't you see the man's condition? Son, calm down. You hit it by accident. You have no crime, Metin. Look, you hit it by accident. Okay? Look at me. Look at me, calm down. - Be calm. You hit it by accident. I -Kaçal. - Where should we escape my son? Nonsense. -Sa Salih, let's run. Calm down, Metin. We are guilty when not guilty. Sit down. Sit down. Let's think about what to do. My life ends, Salih. Help me, Salih. -Look at me. - It's been by accident, okay? Help me, Salih. It happened by accident, okay. Help me, Salih. Ok Metin, stop. Calm down. Uncle. Uncle. Salih. Just leave that phone. What are you doing son? Nonsense. - Download that weapon. I said just leave! I said stop it, Salih. I said let him go. I said leave Salih, let go. This movie was shot in the direction of Salih. I said salih leave. Those who do this ... ...I will bring wick from the nose of all those who left you alone on this difficult day. You will see. Your mother will punish them all. They will also experience the hell you live. If the sky (the sky) and the supply (earth) were involved to unfairly pour the blood of a competent servant ... God would throw them both to hell. Hadith-i Sharif
