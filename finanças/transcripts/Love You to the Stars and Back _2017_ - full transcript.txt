Mika, my dear. Hi, sweetie. Look. Aunt Sheryl cooked this for you. All of your favorite food. Yes. Including spaghetti with meatballs. That's your favorite, right? Well... Mika. You're going to be a big sister. Your Aunt Sheryl is pregnant. Mika, slow down. Mika. I'm sorry, I'm full. Excuse me. Mika. Mom's cooking is still better. You know what? I feel like... the aliens are going to abduct me soon. I've been getting sick a lot lately. - Mom! - What? We'll all be abducted by aliens anyway. And it's a privilege to be taken by aliens. It means that you're special, and that you deserve a better and a happier place outside the Earth. So when it happens, remember to look up. I'll be there with the aliens. Mom... Mom? Mom, I'm here. Mom? Dad is also here. Mom? Mom... Doctor! Mom... Doctor! Mom? No! Patient's not breathing. Patient has no pulse. - Begin CPR. - Yes, doctor. - Mika! - No! Mom! - No! - Mika! - Mom! - Enough. That's enough. Mom... No... Time of death? 10:06 a.m. They're real. Nothing is impossible in this world, Mika. You just have to believe. Okay? DEAR MIKAELA CONGRATULATIONS, DEAR! MERRY CHRISTMAS, DEAR! Let's get started. Drive safe. Miss, are you an alcoholic? I'm not an alcoholic, just going through something. Ma'am. Ma'am! Ma'am! Ma'am, please open! Ma'am, we need the parking space for the real customers. Sir, I'm sorry. I fell asleep. I ate the stuff I bought as a real customer. Yes. Okay, ma'am. Go away, bad spirits! Go away... Success! Hey! What did you see? Did you see it? - No. I didn't see anything! - Pervert. - Miss, wait! - Pervert! Disgusting! - Police! - Wait! Let me explain! - Police! - Miss! Miss! - I swear I didn't see anything! - Stop following me! Swear, I didn't see anything! Miss! - Here. - Thanks, bro. Bro, just explain it to Mom, okay? - Yes, just be back right away. - Yes, bro. Are you sure you don't want us to drive you? No need. I'm fine on my own. Okay. If there's a problem and you need backup, text me right away, okay? - Caloy? - All right. - Hey, hurry. Go. - Go. Take care, Caloy! - Caloy! - I said remove this. - Hey! - This kid is really crazy! Caloy! Gosh! Wear your mask! You keep forgetting! All good? Take care! - Bye! - Caloy? Mom, why? Where's Caloy? - What? - Caloy? - Where is he? - That's right. Where's Caloy? What do you mean... Oh, God! Caloy! You... - That's Caloy! - No, Mom. I'm already hungry! - No, Mom. You're just hungry! Let's go. - I'm hungry, Mom! - Wait! - That's not him! - Why did you let him go? - We didn't let him. - We didn't! - Did you allow him? - No, we didn't! - Let's go, Mom! Hi, Caloy! Are you going back next semester? When we get the money. Here. Thank you, sir. Hurry up. Go away, bad spirits! Go away, bad spirits! Success! Hey! What did you see? Did you see it? No. I didn't see anything, miss. - Pervert! - I didn't see anything! How will I see anything with all these bushes? - Your poop stinks! - Can poop even smell good? - Stop following me! - Miss! - I said I'm sorry! - I'm going to call the police! - I didn't see anything! Nothing! - Stop following me! It hurts! Sorry! I'll bring you to the hospital. Do you know where it is? No! No need! - What? Let's go! - I'm okay. I'm all right! - I can stand properly. - You're not okay! - No, I am. See? - No, I'll take you there. Miss, you don't have to! I know... Miss Beautiful! Oh, God! That hurts! Just take me to where I'm going and we can call it even. I won't sue you! - Seriously? Sue me? - Shh. Anything you say or do will be used against you. What? I'm fine, see? - Let's go! - No! - Come on! - No... - Get inside. - I said I can walk. My bike. Yuck! It stinks! I got it. - I said I got it. - I'll help you. I can do it. Okay, just hold the door. There! Oh, God! Great! Do you have ice? My God! That's a huge bruise! I'm bringing you to the hospital! - Relax. It's just a bruise. - No, that's something! - I just need ice. Do you have ice? - In my jug. There's ice. I'll get it. Just drive. Hey! Eyes on the road! That's a huge bruise! I just need ice. Look. - Wear your seat belt. - No. It's heavy. Wear it! What if we get into an accident? Are you saying I'm a bad driver? I'm saying, what if we get into an accident? Then so be it! - Let me die! - What? Hmm... Now can you wear your seat belt? I'll do it. I can do it. It feels good to wear a seat belt. See? So when you suddenly hit the brakes, you won't hit the dashboard. See? It's okay now. Where will I drop you off? Is it far? You want to be rid of me now? I'm only asking because we might reach the end of the earth and you're still here. You're funny, miss. You can be in a comedy show. - Are you making fun of me? - It's so funny. You think you're funny? You're so sensitive! Mister, I didn't offer you a ride so we could have small talk, okay? - And? - You're lucky that I bumped into you. Others would have just left you. Carabaos would probably be feasting on you now. Miss, carabaos don't eat humans. Mister, there's always a first time. Not when it's really impossible. - What? Mister! - What? - Didn't they teach you? - What? - Nothing is impossible in this world! - What are you talking about? - Many things are impossible! - No! - Yes! - No! Is it possible to snow in the Philippines? It's not, right? It's not impossible with global warming. Wasn't there a country that had snow for the first time? Is it possible for crows to be white? - No. - There are human albinos. I'm sure there are also albinos in crows. - Is it possible... - What? Is it possible that? - Wait! Is it possible... - What? Is it possible? Sir, whatever it is, it's possible! Okay? Even Trump became the President of the United States. I'm telling you now, nothing is impossible in this world. Wow! You're a big talker. Carabaos don't really eat people! - They do! - They don't. Carabaos are vegetarian! - I know what you're saying. - They don't eat meat... My God! Stop right there. I'll ask that guy over there. - Who are you going to ask? - I'll ask him. - You're gonna bother someone? - Can we ask you something? Do carabaos eat humans? - No. - There, see? They don't! - He didn't even say anything! - Thank you, sir! Love you! Sir! Let me! - No! He said no! - Sir! What if a human body decomposes and becomes fertilizer? A carabao won't know that there's a human body in what it's eating. Of course it's still going to eat it. Right? - Well... - Yes! He said yes! Hey! He didn't say anything! - Thank you, sir! - For what? - He didn't answer! - Silence means yes! I love you, sir! I love you more! - Shh! But... - Let's go! But fertilizer is different from a human body, right? Miss Beautiful, we're talking about humans, not humans becoming fertilizers, right? Yes, but, sir, the fertilizers came from humans. It's just in a different form. Sir, am I right? A fertilizer is a fertilizer! A human is a human! - Right, sir? - There are still - human ingredients in the fertilizer! - Ingredients? - Stop it. He's already confused! - You're confusing him! Enough! If you two want to fight over carabaos, don't involve me! I have better things to do! You're wasting your youth! And you! If you get pregnant, then it's going to be such a pity for your parents. You don't even have a job! What a shame! You're too young to flirt around! You're fighting over carabaos! Sir! First of all, he's not my type! And second, it's better to be interested in carabaos - than other nonsense on the internet. - Hey, enough. Is it our fault that - our generation has Facebook? - That's enough. - That's the problem with you older people. - Shh. Enough. He's gone. You think we're shallow, that all we know is taking selfies! If you had it wouldn't you take selfies during the EDSA Revolution? - Enough. - I'm not yet done! - I'm going to pick a fight! - Fine. Go ahead. Hey, mister. Don't turn your back on me! Water. Water, please! You used this when you pooped! You used this for cleaning! - This isn't it! - Disgusting. You used that! - I'm going to punch you, too! - No. - You're just like that guy! - See? Here. - I'll hit you! - I'm drinking from it! You're disgusting! Caloy. Mika. So I'm not your type? Tell me. After everything, that's what you remember? So what? No. Is that a problem? Well... no. Why? Am I your type? Uh... Silence means yes. Hey! I just wasn't able to answer! Why would you be my type? Gross! Type? Type? Type? Oh, poop! - Sir? - Sir! - Get in, mister! - We'll give you a ride. - Sir? - Let me talk to him. Sir! We're sorry about what happened. - We didn't mean to bother you. - Sir. Don't worry. - We'll bring you to your destination. - Please, get in. The next town is still a long way from here. When you get there, your chickens might turn into fried chicken! Fried chicken! What? What about my chickens? - Caloy will take care of them. - What? Why me? Mister, what are those chickens for? A birthday party? Or a restaurant? Do you own one? Or maybe you have... Left! Turn left! Your chickens! That's ours! Hey! That's mine. Come on! Let's go! This is mine! This is mine! - That chicken is mine! - Yours? - You're too slow! You were just staring! - That's mine! I'll give that to him! I'll do it! - You're too slow! How will you get it? - Give me the chicken! I got it! Not you! Fine, it's yours. Kid! There's one more! My son will marry the former mayor's granddaughter. We will give these chickens to them, so they won't speak ill of us. I promised ten chickens. There are only six now. Sir, I'm sorry. I will explain to them. - I'll do it. You might just yell at them. - No. I can do it! - I'll talk to them. - Let me explain. - I can do it. - I'll do it! - I think... - Go straight! - Okay, you explain, sir. - I think that's wise. Hey. That's the monster's lair. - Sir. - Oh, no. Sir? Sir! Sir? Hey, mister! Sir? Lord, have mercy on me. Amen. - Good day... - You're late, Berting! It seems like today's event is not important to you. That's not true... Don't you know that time is money? Don't you know that time is gold? - Gold? - If you do not respect my time, then you do not respect me! Hey, what are you doing? She'll eat you alive! Good morning, ma'am! I'm sorry to interrupt, but I just want to explain Mr. Berting's side. We passed by Mr. Berting when he was on his way here. He was carrying ten chickens under the heat of the sun. So we let him ride with us. But please know that in the short time that we were with him, we know that he is a kind man. Time is gold. And time is money, yes. But a heart of gold is as precious, too. Nailed it! Yes! - Leon or a! - Yes, ma'am? - Make tinola out of those chickens! - Yes, ma'am. - Dear in-law. Come in. - Yes? Here. Here's another one. You were so good! Are you "Master of English"? Did you see the old lady's face? She's going to get a nosebleed because of you. "Time is gold. Time is money. Yes. But a heart of gold is as precious, too." Thank you. What? - Let's give it back. Come on. - They'll just turn it into tinola. I feel sorry for it. What are we going to do with this? Baby. Come here, baby. It's okay, baby. You're safe here. The old lady won't eat you anymore. You know why? Because we're here. Your mommy and... daddy! Your mommy! Baby, Mommy is here! What did you say? Mommy! Mommy is here. Not just that. Mommy... Mommy and Da... Daddy! Come here, baby! Come to Daddy! Daddy! I'm your daddy! So, Mommy and Daddy? I knew it. I'm your type. Daddy, baby! Daddy, baby! What should we name it? What about Whitey? Hello, Whitey! How are you, Whitey? Where's the light? Point to the light! There's the light, Whitey! Point! No response. That's a dog's name. What about First? It's my first chicken. Hello, First! Right? How about Lasty? I'm sure that will be my last pet. Chicken joy? I don't think so. Goldie? Goldie! Oh, Goldie. Your full name is "Time is Gold, Time is Money!" Close, open... Hello, bro? How are you? I'm good. You? Did you get there already? Not yet. But I'm okay. I'll text you once I get there. Have you eaten? You said you would make a stopover to eat. You'll starve yourself. No, brother. I ate quail eggs. Quail eggs? Are you allowed to eat that? I'll eat a proper meal later. I'll text you. How's Mom? As usual, she got melodramatic. She wants to follow you. How typical of Mom. I'm going to be okay. I'll text you as soon as I get there. Exactly. I told her that you'll be quick and you'll be back safe. Your sister left later than usual to calm her down. I needed to leave early. I'll go to the charity office for your application. Luckily, I was able to board a bus right away. Didn't you bring a car? No. A buyer will look at the car later. Didn't I tell you not to sell your car? That's your first car! Don't worry about it. It's my car, remember? All right, Caloy! Take care! Don't forget to eat! Okay, bro. Take care. I love you. I love you, bro! I was hoping maybe we could eat. There's food in the back. A lot. I was hoping for a proper meal. Gosh! You're too picky! Kids in Somalia don't even have anything to eat. Sorry. I really can't eat junk food. What are you? Seven? That's what the doctor told me. Your doctor's a killjoy. What's your illness? Cough? Tonsillitis? Cancer. Cancer. What do you mean cancer? You're funny! You can be in a comedy show! Cancer? What? Why did you stop? Are you serious about having cancer? Actually, acute myeloid leukemia. Is there a problem? You have cancer? Uh, and so... You have cancer! Shh! Be quiet! Goldie might hear you! So what if I have cancer? That's cancer! - And? - Not just cough, not tonsillitis! - But cancer! - And then? Am I the only one who has a problem with cancer? Cancer is only a problem if you make it one, okay? Why do you know better? Are you the one with cancer? Wow! What stage? There are no stages in leukemia. Is it terminal? Based on research, 12 months to live. - Twelve months to live? - Yes. And if we don't eat now, I might only have 11 months. Goldie, we're going to eat! Baby! My baby! Here is the menu do and carabeef jerky. Thank you, ma'am. Are you sure that cancer patients can eat carabeef jerky? I'm sure. Let me just remind you, that almost killed us earlier. Shh. Miss Beautiful, if you don't want to eat carabao meat, then don't order it! No one is forcing you. I'll eat this because this is a rare experience. If it's not good, then it's not. But what if it's good? It's so good! Yummy! The taste lingers! It's so good! Fine. I'll eat it. Just stop that. - It's good, right? - It tastes bad! - Did you die? - No! See? There you go! Not yet! Who's that? Excuse me. Hello, Dad? Mika, where are you? Why didn't you come home? Pa, we have no class today. Where are you? The help told me you didn't come home. So where are you? Dad, I'm an adult now. I know what I'm doing. What? An adult? Dad, just let me be. Mikaela! What is this? Go home now. Dad, if this were Mom, she would just let me be. Dad, I'm sorry. I already miss Mom. My mom also didn't allow me to leave. She knew that I would go to my dad. My mom... is mad at my father. The last time I saw him... Actually, the last time he showed up... I was ten years old. Before he left, I asked for this watch. He didn't want to give it at first because it's a Rolex. My father is kind of a show-off. Handsome. Good with the ladies. English-speaking. I told my mom... "Mom... I have leukemia. Eventually, I will die. We just don't know when. But, hopefully, before I do... I would see my father." And so... My mom told me that my father's a jerk. And she just doesn't want me to get hurt. I told her... "Mom, if he's a jerk... then he's a jerk. He's still my dad. I accept him for who he is." But you know what I think? Any father who finds out that his son is dying... will no longer be a jerk for his son's sake. - Do you have your father's address? - Yes, I do. Oh, here. Just drop me off at Calaca. They say it's just nearby. I'll just ride my bike going there. No. I'll bring you to your father's house. No need. I can manage. How can you ride your bike when you're injured? My foot hurts, but I'm not injured. What if you get tired? Wait. Do you pity me? No. No, you pity me. It's okay. I'm used to that. When people learn that I have cancer, that's all they remember about me. "Caloy? The one with cancer?" "The one who's dying?" Then they pity me. And take care of me. I have cancer, but I'm not yet dying. I can even bike from here to Calaca. What a long speech. I'll take you there not because I pity you, but because I want to. - Let's get started. - You just want to be with me. - Seat belt, please. - Yes, sir. Why are you going to Mt. Milagros? Are you a mountaineer? No. Why are you going there? For camping? - Stargazing? - No! - Why? Is it a secret? - No. So why won't you tell me? You're so unfair! You might laugh at me. I won't laugh at you. Promise! Hope to die? Gosh! I promise but I won't swear with my life. Sorry. But, really, do you promise? Promise! Others promised that they wouldn't laugh, but when I told them, they laughed anyway. What a long speech! Mika, if you don't want to tell me, then don't! - Stop... - I want to be abducted by aliens. Aliens? You find it funny. You find it funny. It's obvious. Aliens? Are you a second-grader? Who would believe in aliens? Aliens! Aliens! What kind of music is that? Sounds old! Is there something more upbeat? Like... That's Mom's favorite. Ah. Sorry. It's nice. ♪ Just give it a try ♪ ♪ Though I'm like chasing rainbows In the sky ♪ ♪ I wanna hold you in my dreams ♪ - ♪ And make believe that it's true ♪ - Where's your mom? She's gone. She got abducted by aliens. ♪ 'Cause you're a star ♪ Sorry. It's okay. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. I'm sorry. - Stop that! I'm driving! - Hey! - Hey! - Caloy, stop it. - Hey. I'm sorry! - We'll get into an accident! Caloy! - I'm sorry! I'm sorry! - Stop! Ugh. The stench stayed in my nose. Your fart stinks! Don't blame your fart on me! It wasn't me! It was you! - You farted! How can it be? - That's you! Did you hear it coming from... Let's stop at the next house so I can use their toilet. I think something came out. Do you have IBM? Your poop stinks! Why? Does your poop smell good? Come on, let's go. - Let's eat! - Yes, ma'am. It's bad to say no to God's graces. My dear, we have visitors. - Caloy and Mika. My daughter, Ronnabel. - Hello! - Hi! - Come on. Sit down. You're eating so little. You haven't eaten all day. You might faint during the prom later. You'll get dizzy. I'm not going to the prom, Mom. Why? The gown will go to waste. The rent is expensive. I borrowed money for that. I'm sorry. I'll just stay here, Mom. Stop that, Ronnabel. It's embarrassing. We have visitors. Eat your food. - Thank you. - Yes, ma'am. Thank you! - Thanks again! - You're welcome. - We'll go ahead. - Hey. Goldie. Oh, shh, shh. Are you tired? - Do you want me to drive? - No, I'm okay. It's okay. I'll drive. Mika, don't worry. I won't crash your car. This is my mom's car. I don't let anyone else drive it. You know what? There's a philosopher that told me that there's always a first time. I know what I'm doing. Continue straight ahead for 500 meters. Just straight ahead! Straight ahead. Straight ahead! Straight ahead! You're going to crash my car! I'm just joking! Relax! We only have a few hours left together. Make the most of it. You'll see. You might miss me. I won't miss you. Maybe you'll miss me. What if I tell you that I will? You have reached your destination. We're here! I'll just change. You might get surprised when you see my abs. Just kidding. Oh, you seem amazed by my body. Does it look good? Sorry. I'm kidding. Thank you. That's nothing. Thank you, too. Why? Well... What is it? What? I'll just get my bike. Okay. Well... Uh... what? Well... Oh, what? What? Your helmet. Yes. My helmet. Thank you. Can I get a hug? How can I help you? Good afternoon. May I speak with Atty. Carlitos Manansala? Oh, I'm sorry. He doesn't take clients here. I'm not a client. Please tell him that I need to speak with him. It's important. Who are you? Tell him it's Caloy. - Caloy? - Yes. Caloy. - Caloy. - Yes. Caloy! Hey! Stop it! I'm driving! Stop! We'll crash! Hey! You're making me miss you more. Stop it. Well, Caloy who? He doesn't know anyone by that name. Carlos. Tell him I'm from Lemery. He'll know who I am. - Carlos. - Yes. Thank you! I lied to Caloy. The truth is that I'll miss him. Maybe if I told him, I wouldn't feel this way. Don't worry, I'll text him. Shit! You're right! I didn't get his number! Did you get it? How could you be mad? You didn't get it either. I'm sorry. He's busy. He can't come out to meet you. - It's better if... - Tell him it's Caloy. His son with Linda. Please, ma'am. What? You want me to go back? Go back to Caloy? Are you sure? Isn't it embarrassing? Fine. You're sure? - What happened? - He wants you to leave. He doesn't know anyone named Caloy or Linda. Please. Don't give us trouble. Ma'am, please. I traveled far. Come on. Even just a while. Three minutes. Just three minutes. Please, ma'am. He wants to give you this. Tell him his son wants him to have this. I don't need his money. What will I do with that? Tell him that if I needed money, I would have sold his watch. He's really a jerk, isn't he? Tell him he's a jerk! My mom was right! My father is a jerk! Damn it! Tell him that! Caloy! What happened? Seat belt. Caloy, seat belt. Let's go. - Put on your seat belt first. - Let's go. Do you have chips? How about beer? Caloy, you can't have that. Caloy! Caloy, you can't have that. Caloy! That's bad for you! That's bad for you! Hello? Caloy? Hello, son? Hello, Mom. How are you, Mom? My God, son! Where are you? What? Have you eaten? Have you taken your meds? What's happening to you? Caloy! Mom, I'm fine. I'm still your good-looking son. Stop kidding around! So? Did you see your... good-for-nothing father? Your jerk of a father? No, Mom, he's okay. He let me inside his house. He hugged me. It's like he missed me a lot. He's just faking it! Don't fall for that! He even offered me juice. He's okay. There's no problem at all. Son... can you please come home so you can see your Aunt Judy? Aunt Judy? Mom! Didn't I tell you not to borrow money from her? Didn't she insult you before? She even called you a bad mother. Remember? When we borrowed money for my chemotherapy? I don't mind it. What's important is your treatment. Okay. Okay, Mom. Mom. I love you, Mom! I love you, too! Come home! Take care! I love you, Mom. You can drop me off here. No, Caloy, it's okay. I'll take you home. - No, just drop me off here. - No. Caloy, I'll bring you home. - Drop me off here. - Caloy! I'll bring you home! Just drop me off here! I already said... Caloy! Thank you, Mika. You can go now. - Leave, Mika. - Caloy, don't... please talk to me. I said leave, Mika! - No, I will listen... - Just go! Go! Caloy, I will listen. Why can't you just leave me alone? I told you to leave! Talk to me. I don't want to talk! Leave me alone! Go! Caloy, talk to me. What? Can't I really have what I want? I just want to be left alone! It's okay. Caloy, I'm here for you. I'm so stupid! I'm so stupid! Stupid! You're a jerk, Dad! You're a jerk! Why didn't I listen to Mom when she told me that you're a worthless jerk? You're a prick! God! What is this? You neglected me once again! I just wanted to talk to him! Why can't you grant that wish? Let me go! You're all the same! I thought my cancer was gone. I thought it was gone. Caloy... Why me? Answer me! What did I do wrong? I'm a good person! I'm a good son! Why didn't you give this to bad people? Why me? What kind of god are you? What kind of god are you? Answer me! Answer me! Caloy. Why are you crying? You don't want me talking to your god that way? You don't understand how I feel. Take my place! Take my cancer! You want that? Go! Please, Mika, leave! - No... - Leave me alone, Mika! Just go! Why won't you leave? - No! - You won't leave? No! Don't do that! - Leave me alone! Go! - Don't do that! - I'll go. Just don't do that. - Leave! - I'll leave you! Don't do it, please! - Go! - Go down! - Leave! Leave! Caloy, let me... Get my medicine. It's in my bag. Get up. Please. I'm okay. I'm fine. Thank you. Where do you want to go? To Mt. Milagros. Where the aliens are. Are we far from Mt. Milagros? According to the GPS, it's 34 minutes away. And then what will we do when we get there? We'll climb to the top. Then we will stand there. One meter apart is the recommended distance for two people to call. We'll close our eyes. If you want, you can raise your hands. And then... we'll begin to chant. What's the chant? Ashira grevinda mama ajaarum. Ashira grevinda mama ajaarum. Where did you get that? I made it up. You just made it up? Hardcore! Actually, you don't really need a chant to call the aliens. They will arrive whenever they want, right? But I thought I'll have a better chance to be noticed with a chant. Ashira grevinda mama ajaarum. Ashira grevinda mama ajaarum. - Ashira grevinda... - Wait, slow down. - Ashira grevinda... - Ashira grevinda... - Mama ajaarum. - Mama ajaarum. Ashira grevinda mama ajaarum. Ashira grevinda mama ajaarum. Ashira grevinda mama ajaarum! Ashira grevinda mama ajaarum! Ashira grevinda mama ajaarum! Ashira grevinda mama ajaarum. So when the aliens abduct us, what will happen to us? Nothing is certain. Maybe it will be different from here. No more sadness. No more pain. Mom told me that she'll be there. Are you sure? There might still be pain. Nothing is sure. But sometimes, you just have to believe. Is that Ronnabel? Yes, it's her. Ronnabel? Why are you on your way back home? I decided not to go to the prom. Why? A prom is a once-in-a-lifetime experience! I just went there to sign the attendance. So Mom won't get mad, but I'm fine. I'll just go to bed. Tell us the truth. Because... my crush is going to graduate soon. So? He doesn't like me. How can you tell? He doesn't even know me. You won't go to the prom just because of that? I don't know with you, but from where I'm from, if you like someone and he doesn't like you back, nothing should change. Even if he tosses you out. Even if he doesn't know you. If you like someone, then you like someone. Should we bring you back to the prom? I'll only go if you come along with me. Good evening. Picture? Sure. Let's go. Smile! Selfie? So where's your crush? Shh! Caloy. Do you have a crush on Mika? - Dance with her! - No! What if she says no? What if she says yes? So that's your crush. - What? - It's him! - He's making you blush, right? - Caloy! ♪ I couldn't believe ♪ ♪ That I'm spending time with you ♪ ♪ I dream of you ♪ ♪ In every waking day ♪ ♪ It may seem impossible ♪ ♪ But I know it will be you and me ♪ I have a plan.

Hey! Why are you stripping? Didn't you know that when you're lost, you have to wear your shirt inside out? What gimmick is that? That's not a gimmick! My mom said that when you're lost, you should ask for help. Who will you ask in the middle of nowhere? - Do you see someone I don't see? - Don't scare me! Just wear your shirt inside out! No harm in trying. Stop it! Just do it! Don't peek. - Hey! I just told you! - What a jerk! And why would I take a peek at you? You might want to see my abs! What abs? You don't have abs, Caloy! Sometimes, you just have to believe. You have a lot to say. Just get dressed. - Just wear your shirt! You talk too much. - One, two, three, four, five... Oh, no. I'm missing one. Are you done? Are you done? Your turn. Face that way! You think I'm interested in your body? You're more muscular than me! Just face that way! I'm already looking away. Make it quick! Don't look! I'm not looking! Just get dressed! Just the shirt. No need for the pants. What? - Are you done? - Yes. Your trick doesn't seem to be working. Mt. Milagros, here we come! Bye, Goldie. Are you ready? For what? To get abducted by aliens. Can I make one last phone call? Sure. Hello? Hello, Mom? Where are you? Come home! It's already late! Mom, I'm all right. Don't worry. Have you taken your meds yet? Mom, I'm okay. - Hello, Dad? - Are you okay? I'm fine, Dad. Please come home! I'm worried about you. Dad, I'm fine. Don't worry about me. I'm okay. I'm sorry, Dad. I love you. I love you, Dad. Bro, thank you for selling your car. It will really help. But I want you to use the money to buy a new car. You'll need that for your job, right? - The girls like that, too. - Jerk! I love you. I love you more, bro. Mika? Sheryl, I'm sorry if... I'm sorry if I wasn't nice to you. But I want you to know that... what's important for me is that Dad is happy. And I can see that you're making him really happy. I know. So thank you. - Mom... - Caloy, come home! You took care of me your whole life. Now, you should put yourself first. Caloy, come home now! I love you so much. What's the chant again? Ashira grevinda mama ajaarum. Ashira grevinda mama ajaarum. Ashira grevinda mama ajaarum. Ashira grevinda mama ajaarum. Ashira grevinda mama ajaarum. Ashira grevinda mama ajaarum. Mika! Helicopter. Will the aliens... only arrive tonight? What about tomorrow? - Tomorrow is okay, too. - Let's try tomorrow. AUNTIE SHERYL Whoo! Can't sleep? Yes. Thanks. Last beer before the aliens take us. Game! So good! What are you thinking? I'm thinking... if the aliens will take us tomorrow... I'll miss out on a lot of things. I want to go to Disneyland. I'll miss out on that. I haven't even been to Palawan. I haven't tried skydiving. I want to meet Kobe Bryant. We'll play one-on-one. I haven't climbed Mt. Everest. I wonder what it's like to get a tattoo. They say it's painful. I wonder what it's like to be in love. They say it's the best feeling in the world. But when you get hurt, it's also the most painful. I know. You know what? That feeling... of overwhelming joy... of not wanting to lose her... of not wanting the moment to end. You feel the most alive. You want to be near her. You want to kiss her. Just like this. I'm good! I don't care if I don't ever go to Disneyland. IF YOU WERE HERE, WE WOULD HAVE BEEN CHAMPIONS Caloy! Caloy! Don't be lazy! Let's go! Caloy! Don't be unfair! You said you would wait for me! Caloy! Mika, good morning! Let's have breakfast! - Caloy... - No, I'm okay. I'm fine. Caloy! - Hey, you need to get up. - No. What do I need to do? - Can I help you... - No, I'm okay. - Caloy, get up. Please. - Mika, I'm fine. There. Get up! - Help! We're here on the third floor! - I'm fine, Mika. Caloy, where's your phone? Why? - Your phone. - I'm a mess. It's okay. Come here. Caloy, please. I can manage. - No! - I said I'm okay. Where's your phone? Why? Why do you need it? I'm sorry. - Mika! - No! Mika! - Caloy, I'm sorry. - What are you doing? - I'm sorry. - Don't call them, Mika! - Caloy, I need to. - Don't call them, please, Mika! Caloy, I'm sorry, but I have to. - No! Don't! - I need to. No, please, don't! I don't want them to know! - No! - They need to know! Mika, please! Mika, please! Mika, please! Stop! Caloy, sorry! No, Mika, please! Caloy! Hello? Hello? Hello? - Hello? - Mika! Is this Caloy's brother? He's having an attack. I'm taking him to the hospital. Mika, no! I'll meet you there! Okay. Caloy! Get up, Caloy! Please! - I'm sorry. - Do you know what you did, Mika? Caloy, I'm sorry. You ruined my plan. They'll take me to Manila for my transplant. - Do you know how much it costs? - No! Do you know the success rate of a bone marrow transplant? Fifty to sixty percent chance! We'll spend 4.5 million just for that? - Why did you tell my mom? - Caloy. I'm a burden to my family, Mika! Why do you always decide for me? Are you the one in pain? The one going through the treatments? The one who has to endure the surgery... We're all willing to risk that 50% chance to keep you alive! Seeing you in pain hurts us, too! We won't give up on you because we love you! I love you! So let's go! Help! We're here on the third floor! Caloy! - What's going on? - Please, help! Get up, son! Nurse! Nurse! Nurse! Please help me! Caloy! Wake up, Caloy! Leave it to me, ma'am. He's bleeding! Where is Caloy Enriquez? Miss. Thank you very much. What happened? - Thank you. - Caloy? Son? What happened to you? We already have 4.5 million. We will go to Manila, okay? We arranged your bone marrow transplant. Bro, we'll take care of everything. Don't worry. Ashira grevinda mama ajaarum! Ashira grevinda mama ajaarum! Ashira grevinda mama ajaarum. Ashira grevinda mama ajaarum. I'm begging you! Take me! Ashira grevinda mama ajaarum! Ashira grevinda mama ajaarum! Ashira grevinda mama ajaarum. Ashira grevinda mama ajaarum. Ashira grevinda mama ajaarum. - You can do it! - Son, you can do it! - You got this! This will be quick. - Keep fighting. We love you, son! We'll be right here. - We'll be waiting. We love you. - I love you, bro. - I love you. You can do this. - We love you! You'll be okay! Lord, please. Lord, please. I'm Dr. Ledesma, I'll conduct the surgery. Nurse, check the vital signs. - Administer oxygen. - Okay, doctor. Ashira grevinda mama ajaarum. Ashira grevinda mama ajaarum. Ashira grevinda mama ajaarum. Ashira grevinda mama ajaarum. Ashira grevinda mama ajaarum! Ashira grevinda mama ajaarum. Ashira... Ashira grevinda mama ajaarum. Ashira grevinda mama ajaarum! Ashira grevinda mama ajaarum! Ashira grevinda mama ajaarum! Ashira grevinda mama ajaarum. Ashira grevinda mama ajaarum. Caloy. Mika. If there's a problem and you need backup, - text me right away, okay? - Okay. I promise, but I won't swear with my life. - Hey, I'm sorry! - We'll get into an accident! Caloy! - I'm sorry! - Stop! Caloy! I love you very much. I love you, son! - We'll just be waiting. - We love you, Caloy. Okay? - Please don't. - I love you! No... I choose to stay. Mom. Caloy. Caloy... - Caloy. - I love you, Mom. I love you. Caloy... I love you. I love you, too. Thank you, Mom. Goldie? Mika? - Mika, I'm here. - Caloy. Mika is not here. But, yesterday, during your surgery, she left this chicken. She told us that Goldie should be here when you wake up. Where is she? She left. But she gave us money. She told me not to tell you about it. But it was a big help. And... here. She left this for you for when you wake up. Caloy, I didn't see the aliens. They didn't take me. At first, I thought it was because they weren't real, or because they didn't want to take me, but now, I know why. They didn't take me because the truth is, I didn't want to go with them. I love my mom very much. But I realized that I am still loved here on earth... by Dad... by Auntie Sheryl... by my future sibling... sometimes, I think you might love me, too. You can drop me off here. I'm sorry if I'm saying all of this through a letter. May I ask a question? I don't know if you still want to see me after everything that happened. And she has bangs like... - I hope you survived, Caloy. - Her hair... - I hope you didn't give up. - No, sorry. I hope you're able to read this. Thank you for everything, Caloy! Even if it's impossible, I still pray that someday we'll see each other again. Maybe on the road again, at the mall, or in our dreams... or at Mt. Milagros. I'll always go back there. That's our place. Yours and mine. I just hope we'll see each other again. No. We will see each other again.
