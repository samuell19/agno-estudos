My husband is back! - Your husband? Why didn't you tell me earlier? I told you! You just pretended not to understand. I'm deaf! When I hit on you, you should've said! Hurry up! My husband hates cops! I hate other people's husbands too! I'll hide. Gotta hurry. Oops! Nowhere to hide this time. Damn. My wife's woken up. Exhale. Inhale. Exhale. Inhale. Inhale. Exhale. Inhale. Exhale. Inhale. Exhale.

Take a rest as you're still not feeling well. Hey, hey! What babe kept you away till now? Don't worry. She's just faking it. - I've got a mistress tucked away. - There's no reason for me to stay. She was waiting up for you downstairs until she fainted. - I revived her and she's ok now. - I'm big dumbo. - You look like one. Where are you from? - Hakka. You're from hakka? Me too. - We're the same. - Take care of your wife, I'm leaving now. Wife! I'm so sorry. I won't fool around any more. Lucky we ran into one of ours, huh? Wife! Wife! You've fainted again! Wife! Wife! Wife, wake up! Wife! - Good morning. - One horlicks, two breakfasts. - Two... breakfasts. - How much is it? - It comes to $20. Thank you. - Thanks. - What are you having today? - Whatever it is, it's wasted on me. One glass here. Two breakfasts. Two horlicks served in one glass. - Chopsticks won't replenish me. - Ok. It's good for the health. It's a special recipe. Bruce Lee taught Jackie chan. Jackie chan taught Alain delon, Alain delon taught Stallone. Stallone taught ti lung. Ti lung told me. Didn't he tell you? Oh well. - Wow! Skinny, look at him! - I eat them too! You only drink raw quail's eggs! No wonder you're so tiny! Sanwa bank Don't move! This is a hold-up! Robbery! Robbery! Robbery! Robbery! Robbery! Police! Freeze! - Police! Don't move! Freeze! - I'm a cop too. Lock him up! Pal, give... give me a glass of water. - Here you go. - Thanks. Mr li, got the hiccups? Have some water. It's useless. I had some already. My grandma said a good scare would get rid of hiccups. Sis, do... do something to scare me. - Rob... robbery! - It's not working! - Freeze! - Don't bother me! Force him inside! Don't come any closer or I'll kill him! - Freeze! - Oh! Don't try anything! I'll blow his head off! Walk inside! - It's not my fault! I'm just a passer-by! - Don't try anything or I'll kill him! - Shoot then! I'll definitely kill you! - What? If you kill me, I'll kill him! Fine! I don't know this jerk. I'll count to three and we'll fire together! You asshole! Why are you doing this to me? One. Two. Three! Don't move! Guys, lock him up! - This jerk peed in his pants. Who is he? - Don't you know him? - I should know him? - He's undercover. - A sergeant? - Yes. Call an ambulance. I've got to go. Ok. Poison snake ping is on his way. - Big brother. - Why are you late? The thais moved a bit slow. What's going on? No problem. It's fine. Brother ping! You watched me load the merchandise. Fucker! This jerk dared to pull a trick on us! You shouldn't have killed the thai. How can we trace the merchandise? I'll get some merchandise. I'll take whatever I can get a hold of. I will recover the merchandise. You can kill me if it's short. I won't be played that easily. Fail - brother. - Our transaction - monitor it closely. Yes. Ping. Get the merchandise back immediately. Yes, brother fai. Marie-Donna, your older brother's here. My brother? Keep dancing. - Brother, it's nice to see you. - I have something to say. - Mum's asked you to go back. - Let's not talk about that now. Sit down. - I almost got killed. - What? That thai guy tried to betray me. - Then how did you get away? - I killed him. What? Brother, you killed someone? I had no choice. I can't stay in Hong Kong. Once I earn some more money, then I'll come home. You still want to continue doing this? Of course. That's worth tens of thousands of dollars. The address is inside. Deliver it for me. Brother, that's very dangerous. I know. I'll risk it one more time. Let's stop, brother. There's still one more big transaction on the 29th. If I succeed, once we get home, we won't have any worries any more. Did you two find the body? Yes. We found it as soon as we started digging. - Yeah! - Mr pak, I found a passport. Where's 4198? - Did you two discover the body? - Yes, sir. Where is he? - He's still in hospital. - Get him back right now! - You are a rare beauty. - Get in bed or I'll get a major scolding. The doctor said I need psychological and physiological help. Come on, let's go see a film. Don't make things up. The doctor won't let you out. - The doctor goes drinking with me. - Get in bed. - Let's get together. - Someone's here. - Yes, madame! - Here I am. - Mimi. - She's got you now! - She's my sis. Think about it. - Your darn tricks! - You don't change! - How are you? They said you were injured on duty but you're just lazing around. Why shouldn't I? That asshole scared the lights out of me! - Sergeant! Are you all right? - I'm fine. Thanks for asking. Hold this. You son of a bitch! Asshole! Taking advantage of my sister! - I didn't! - Don't fight! - Have a good rest! - Stop! What are you doing? - It's his physiotherapy. - This is a hospital! - What are you doing? - I'm doing physiotherapy. Even if you're doing physiotherapy you shouldn't wake the other patients. - Go back to your bed. - Go back, brother. - Sorry, Peter. - Ok. No problem. - I'm going to slice him up! - Why are you so pissed off? And why did you start a fight? That bastard stuck a gun in my mouth! He was the robber? He is cid! Help me write a damning statement to report his behaviour! I don't know what to write. Why don't you write it yourself? I don't know how. You went to university! - Show a little self-control. - There still wouldn't be any peace! - Give it a try. - So you're not going to write it for me?! - Fine, I'll write it! - Write something serious! Uncle Jim, take a look. No need to read it. I'm your nephew, please report his behaviour! I've been a cop for 11 years but I've never been this embarrassed ever! He almost got me killed! You have to report his actions! Send him to hell! Ok, ok. Why are you so angry? What's the big deal? I'll let you in on something. Work or personal stuff? - Personal, of course! - Yeah? Your father looked after me when he was alive. Haven't I looked after you? - Yeah, right! - You're saying I've not looked after you? If you had taken good care of me, then I wouldn't still be a sarge after 11 years under your command! You're the one who hasn't shown any potential! You chase girls, avoid responsibility or blame others! Someone points a gun at you and you piss in your pants! The whole station knows about it! Don't shout! Even those who didn't know about it know now! What are you all doing standing around here? See if I won't send you all on graveyard patrols! You don't have to be so mad. I've found a model cop to be your partner to make up for your inadequacies. Uncle Jim, don't send me a heroic type - I can't afford a burial plot. Lucy, ask 20396 to come in. Right now. Hey! Hey, uncle Jim! You've got to be kidding! 20396, report to your sergeant. Oh, we've met before. I've already encountered him. Last time I ended up with shit in my pants. No thank you! Uncle Jim, this way please. Are you kidding around? You want him to be my partner? In other words, you just want me to retire. A job like this? You can shove it. You're really simple and naive, aren't you? Look at him. He's a model cop. If anything happens, he'll get blamed and you'll take the credit. Still think I'm not looking after your interests? You're right. That sounds good. Let me go over and say hello. Sorry. - Sorry, you're one of us. - Please excuse my actions too. - What's your surname? - Tso. - How should I address you? - Michael. Oh, Michael tso. Francis li. - Oh, Francis li. - Yeah, Francis li. That's more like it. You two are partners now. Do you know how I managed to go from being a constable to a chief inspector? By kissing ass and telling tales. Don't say it that loudly. Your father taught me to do that. The important thing is to work on a big case, then your superior will appreciate you. If you're appreciated you can rise up to that rank. Sergeant, you're out of hospital? Thank you for your concern, sir. I just got out. Chief inspector pak, any news on the murder of the thai? Not yet. The guys from the other district aren't up to scratch so our boys are stuck. Tell them to take a different approach. I suspect this murder is linked to the thais' drug smuggling. So, you must follow it closely. It could turn out to be a big case. Did you hear that? The commissioner said it's a big case. You have to be super alert and on duty 24/7. Uncle Jim? Sergeant li is famous for being lazy, will there be a problem? Under my direction, sergeant li is a very able worker. - It's not a problem. - Ok. - What? - Where are you going to look for leads? - All over town. - Are you stupid? This is a big case so you think leads are everywhere? - What else can we do? - Get in the car. - Wow! Cool ride. - Hey, don't touch it! It's expensive. How long have you been a cop? Quite a while - three and a half years. No wonder you think leads are everywhere. Wow, it's got some horsepower! Hey, come over here! You want to die? Leaving fingerprints on my car? Ok, no problem. I'll wipe them off. Come on! - Young man, don't go after my sister. - I haven't! I haven't even dared to think about it. That's good. My sister is expensive goods. You look too much like a thug. Ok, sergeant. Stop! - What is it? - Against the wall now! - Spread your legs! - Hey, I'm sorry! - What are you doing? - He looks like a thug! - He's my neighbour! I'm so sorry! - Let's go! - Looking thuggish isn't a crime! - Asshole! - I'll kick your ass if you don't shut up! Well? - Hey! Take a seat. - Jenny! - Mr li. - Draught beer, please. - Ok. - Two glasses. - Ok. Sergeant, you said we were going to get some leads. - Bro, can't I grab a beer first? - Yeah. Brother loong! You didn't have to serve us. How can I not serve big brother li myself? Don't kid around, brother loong! I look you up whenever I've got a problem. Shake brother loong's hand. Little Michael. My new partner. Hey! Are you trying to make trouble? He doesn't know his place. I apologise, brother loong. What's up? What have you heard around town, brother loong? - Lots. - A rookie cop held a gun to you and you peed your pants in fright! How can you show your face around town? Don't shush me! If it had been me, I would have punched him out! - I can't, he's very muscular! - So what? Imagine beating an ox! It's better than being laughed at! You're kidding, right? We're bros! How can you spread gossip about me? - Michael, what can we do? - Not me! It was on TV! Hey, brother loong. I've already apologised to sergeant li. Please stop talking about it. I see, it was you who messed around with him! - Is that true, little brother? - Let it go. I'm used to it. No one messes around my little bro. If he's upset, I get angry! Let me repeat myself. Sorry! Little brother, don't act like a fool! You're just another ox of a drone! Hey! Hit me again and I'll arrest you for assaulting a policeman! What? You're charging me with assault in my own pub? Idiot! You're an idiot! Arresting him in his own pub? Brother loong! This guy is a bit crazy, he picks fights all the time. I've never been afraid! Fine! Tell him to set aside his gun. Let's have some fun! - Brother loong wants to play. - It's just for fun! Fine! For fun! Sergeant, hold this. Sorry for the trouble. Don't get so serious. - You can all sit down! - Keung, close the doors. - After the fun, I'm buying a round! - The boss is buying a round! Brother loong, why don't I hold it for you? - You in the red shirt! Help move the table! - Coming! Coming! Teach me something, then. You're lucky to be in one piece! Brother loong, congratulations! You're still in excellent shape! Not really. This young man is pretty good. Come on! Get up! I haven't lost yet! Come on! Forget it. Why don't I buy you a beer? Ow! Get up! Come on! You don't have to let me save face! Beat him up, brother loong! We can call it quits now. Come here! I'll buy you a drink. Hey! Are you pretending to be cool? We want to learn what brother loong knows. - Come on! Come over and have a drink. - Ok, brother loong. Three glasses of beer. Here. You only look me up when you're in a jam. What have you heard lately? A recent shipment from Thailand has been doctored. - The vendor was even murdered. - Which group did it? The shipment is already on the market. You figure out the rest. - Where did the shipment come from? - What the hell? Raising your voice like that! Kid, the cocaine business is very high-end nowadays. Check out the new hotel in tsim sha tsui east. Hey, the cakes here are pretty good. Yeah, the cakes are pretty good. Try a piece. Sergeant, this is going nowhere. We've been here for over an hour. Nothing's happening at all. Did brother loong give us a false lead? You think "guilty" will be written on their faces? You idiot! You're right, but how long do we have to wait? If nothing happens today we'll wait again tomorrow and the day after tomorrow and the day after... - How else will you become sergeant? - Fine, we'll wait then. Hey, she needs to pass. I'm sorry. Miss, table for one? - Yes. - Please take a seat. - Would you like a drink? - Fresh milk. That's it. I can see she's something. I don't need you to point her out. Something's out of proportion. Something's up. - I'll interrogate her. - Hey! You're going to scare her witless. I've got a plan. Move aside. Watch! Don't take your eyes away. Don't take your eyes away. Ohl! - Where's my glass? - Where's the glass? Where's my glass? Where did my glass go? The glass fragments didn't get thrown out. Miss, help me look. Where did the glass go? - Would it have gone in the handbag? - Hey! Magician! It's over here. Miss, I was just fooling around. Hey! Waiter! Bill, please. Hey, don't stare. - It's real. - Of course they're real. Thank you. It's $15. Sir, did you grow up on formula milk? What? Yes. How did you know? No wonder you stare at boobs so much! - Fuck you. - You're swearing at me now? No! He said, "do you know me?" I don't speak any damn english! What are you laughing about? What just happened? Plenty! The fact that she snubbed you. Don't kid around! The handbag earlier didn't have a "v" on it. Now it does. - A"v7? - Go follow her. Get the bill. - Waiter, the bill, please! - Waiter, no need for change! Sir, can I help you? - How much is this? - It's new. - It's $2,290. - Wow! Are you giving it to me? That's funny, sir. It's worth it even if you only wear it once. Why don't you try it on? Miss, can I help you? - Can you do me a favour? - What is it? Two perverts are following me. It's those two. - Take these into the changing room. - Ok. A new trick. She's using her bra to pass the goods. I suspect her breasts are fake too. Gentlemen, what can I help you with in the lingerie section? - Ah, I need to buy a bra. - A bra? - Is it for your home use or for going out? - No, it's for my wife. What's the size, then? How big is she? - I forgot to measure. - Like Elsie chan? - Not that big! - Then pat ha? - She doesn't have any! - Anita mui? Her breasts change. - Then is she as big as me? - You're too much! - What's the size? - I think... I see it over there. - What's the size? - Let me take a look. - This is it. Get ready to arrest her. - Got it. She's still here. - Pervert! Pervert! - No! No! Pervert! Pervert! - Stop shouting! - Pervert! Beat them up! They're bad men! - You have to teach them a lesson! - Perverts! Cid! Cid pretending to be perverts? We're cid! Perverts?! - Hey! She's gone! - She's gone? Kwai fong, wo tong tsui road, please. She left in a taxi. - Pal, we're cops. - What is it, sir? Does that taxi belong to your company? - Yes. - Where is he taking that passenger? Ok. Bonehead, bonehead! Boy with glasses calling! - What is it? - Where are you? I'm on ferry street, going to kwai fong, wo tong tsui road. - That's a good gig. - Not bad. Going to buy me dinner? If so, I'll finish early. Tell him there's been an accident at Mei foo bridge. Tell him to use the castle peak road. There's an accident at Mei foo bridge, use castle peak road. That bad? Hey, miss! There's a car accident on Mei foo bridge. - We'll use castle peak road. - I just need to get there quickly. Keep the change. Who is it? - Who is it? - Brother, it's your sister. Shut up! Police! Open the door! Hey! Be careful! I'm out of bullets! Don't move! This is outrageous! Let me go! This is outrageous! - Get out of the way! - Stop or I'll shoot! Don't shoot! Get out of the way! Police! - Move! - Freeze! Police! I'm out of breath! Freeze! Don't do anything stupid! Don't do anything stupid! Fire away! I'll risk his life against yours! If you kill him, I'll kill you! I don't know him very well anyway, fire away! Get out of the way! Freeze! Your ass is really pale! You're one asshole out of luck. - Don't move! - Go and arrest him! - Don't come down! - Don't do anything stupid! I'm going to beat you to a pulp! Just try and hurt innocent people! Heard that! Trying to get away from us?! How can you get away wearing just underpants? Run, then! - Throw your trousers down now! - I'll throw my cap down! - Release the girls! - Release them! Throw them down or I'll shoot them in the head! - Throw them down now! - Take it easy! I'll throw them down! 20396! Take off your trousers! - Why me? - I'm the sergeant, take off your pants! - They're on the way! - How will I face people? You're responsible for two innocent lives! I can just shoot him dead with one shot! - Hurry up! - Remove your pants! - Fine! I'll do it then! - Hurry up! He's taking them off now. Don't hurt the girls! Throw them down! You want to play tricks on me? I'll kill them! Bro! There's still one more pair. Wait a second, ok? Damn you, you set me up, didn't you? No, sergeant. It's windy. Windy? I haven't felt the wind today! - Hurry up! - I'm taking them off! Even the desperate need to catch their breath! How can I face the citizens of Hong Kong now? Here! Don't come down! - Sergeant! What shall we do now? - Don't hurt the two girls! Go to hell! Hey! Follow him! Chase him down! Police! Get out of the way! He's down there! - Freeze! - Bro, don't! Don't! Start the car! Start the car! Drive faster! You asshole! Watch where you're going! What are you honking for?! What?! Outrageous! Running around with no trousers! What? I've got something even more outrageous! Look! Oh! How embarrassing for the royal Hong Kong police. Hey! Look, people! Nothing to see! I've got nothing to show! - Brother, you were brave! - What? - You lost your trousers for him! - Shut up! Let's go! It's the pantless wondercops. "Pantless"? Look, I'm wearing two! Yuck! Sergeant, please go ahead! - Hey! It's the detectives with good legs! - Sergeant! - Haven't you had enough of a laugh? - Don't get so mad. Everyone's happy. - I'll press charges! - Shut up or I'll hit you! Sis. - Well? - What crime have I committed? You had better let me go! If you tell me how you got the money in your purse, I'll release you. My godfather gave it to me, so what? "Your godfather gave it to you"? I think it's payment for smuggling drugs. Don't make up false charges. Smuggling drugs? I'd be jailed for that! - Then how did you get it? - I sleep with men. Wow! You make millions from sleeping with guys? Didn't you know? I'm made of gold. Gold? Hey, sis! She says she's made of real gold! Let's take a good look. Ha! - It's gold plate! She's not even worth $150. - That's too much. Hey, stop moving or we'll charge you with assaulting a cop. - Hey! - I'll get you, you jerk! - Let me go! - Don't overdo it. Get out of my face! Don't move, bitch! What do you want from me? I know about your background and your brother's. You swam to Hong Kong from China. You're a green card holder. Ping was a suspect in a drug smuggling case but we don't have enough evidence. Now he's wanted for assaulting a cop, resisting arrest, drug smuggling and attempted murder. Tell me where your brother's hiding or I'm not letting you go tonight. Let me go or I'll charge you with rape and indecent assault. Rape and indecent assault! - Rape and indecent assault! - Shut up! Be quiet! Rape and indecent assault! - Rape and indecent... - What's going on? - He's committed indecent assault. - Like this? How? It's because I have money in my bag. I'm warning you - tone down your attitude! This is a police station. - So what? - Shut up, bitch! I'm not releasing her tonight. - Watch her. - Ok. - Hey! Let me go! - Sit down! Stop being difficult! - I've got an idea. - What? This case isn't small potatoes. Everyone knows that! It's as obvious as mothers being female! You've always been good at getting women. - Not as good as you. - I'm being serious! Go on! Use some of your flair and charm! - She'll tell you everything. - That's underhanded. Does it sound like a bad deal to you? - Elsie chan's are bigger. - That's not all. Even for the hotel room. That shouldn't be a problem, right? I'm afraid of catching aids. Use condoms. How many do you need? Two is more than enough! Two is already more than enough! Spit it out or I won't let you go! - Sis, let her go. - Sergeant, you're letting her go? Of course we're letting her go. She's innocent. Hey! Are you setting me up? No, no! It was all a misunderstanding. Sis, drop all the charges against her. - Sis, thanks. - My superior explained your background. After I heard him I felt bad. I feel sorry for you. - So I can go? - Of course you can. Get your stuff from the officer on duty, sign for it, then you can go. - Hey, miss! - You're changing your mind? No, no. I want to make it up to you. I want to take you out to dinner. Fine. Go by yourself! - I will. - Sergeant, are you on something? You can't possibly want a piece of her?! I've royal permission, so am I allowed to pursue her or not? Well, can I or not? Yeah? Are you sure the person you did the swap with was poison snake ping's sister? Poison snake ping arranged for us to meet yesterday. Boss, can you trust this girl's word? Mr law, I've worked for the boss for a long time. You just didn't know about it. - The boss didn't trust ping. - Bitch! Only you trusted him implicitly. Mr law, be more careful with your underlings. Damn bitch! I take full responsibility for what poison snake did. I'll settle it to your satisfaction. - Put more strength into it. - Put more effort into it! - Put more strength into it! - More effort! Put more effort into it! Wow! - That's nothing. Add more weight to it! - Ok! There's Marie-donnal! Hey! Michael tso! - Michael tso! - What? Not you guys, just him! Michael, come on! Hey! Marie-Donna's inside. - Hey! I don't see her. - You're blind! - Blind! - But I really can't see her. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. There's a lot of money in here. Oh? Really? You've got guts. - What? - I'll help you get the girl. I don't need your help getting a girl! Wait here! If you see her come out of here, call me. If she leaves by the front door, then ignore me, ok? Really! - This is for you. Don't say anything. - Ok. Hi, Marie-Donna! I don't know. I don't know anything. Hong Kong is paved with gold, you should try to make money here. But you have to know where to make your money. What I hate most in life is someone stealing from me. What's your opinion? Well? Stealing what? Who are you? You're pulling my leg. You don't even know who I am? Yet you know to sell my cocaine. Well? What do you want? What? What do I want? Tell me where your brother poison snake ping is now. Stop! - What's your relationship with her? - None! I'm cid! Cid? Don't! - So you betrayed us to the cops, huh? - No, I don't know who he is. Miss, where is Marie-Donna? She should have finished her class. Maybe she's taking a shower. - May I ask who's asking for her? - Brother Mark. Brother Mark. Please fill out this guest survey, then take a seat in the waiting room to wait for her. If you don't want to fill in the form, I can do it for you. There's no need for you to fill it in. You're welcome. You're very welcome. You're really adorable. You dare to assault a cop? Fai! Don't do anything stupid! Leave him! Forget it, let's go! Don't kill him! Sir! This is the women's section! I know. Why are there so many guys in here? It says this is the women's section. Marie-Donna? Hey, hey! Michael tso! Michael tso! What happened? Was there a fight? - Sergeant, follow those men! - What's so important about them? - These guys wanted to kill Marie-Donna. - Why didn't you tell me earlier?! I was fighting! How could 1? Let's get them! I don't think so. They've gone for lunch. Do you need me to call an ambulance? No! They're just scratches. Of course not. Don't tell people you were beaten up, say you were mauled by dogs, otherwise I'll have to write a report. Hey! Hey! Wake up! Hey! - Do we need to call an ambulance? - You're so dumb! She's our source. If our superiors find out, we'll be in trouble. Do you want a promotion? Then carry her home. - Fine. - Come on! Big brother! Let's go to this address and flush him out. Does it hurt? Mind your own business. Go back to your room. - Who would you like to speak to? - Master ping. - Wrong number. - I didn't get the wrong number. - I'm your big brother. - How are you? I'm good, otherwise, why would I call you? - What is it? - The merchandise from Thailand. Big brother, I'll call you when I'm free. - Why did you hang up? - Big brother! - What happened? - What's going on? - Someone hit you. - Where am I? - My home. - Your home? Where's my bag? You were half naked. Never mind your bag. Where are you going? - To get a glass of water. - Over there. - I treated you well. - Big brother! Why did you steal from me and contact the cops? - I didn't report you to the cops! - How much does your sister know? She doesn't know anything. She's only acting as my courier. Shit! No one's answering. Be careful what you say. - Who do you want to speak to? - Something's wrong! What happened? Tell me. Someone stole all the money. I know, let it go. Did those guys come to look for you? No, no. - Brother, you should leave. - Tell her to come here now. Brother! Why aren't you saying anything? Please stop doing this. It's very dangerous. Mother asked you to go back to the village. You're her only son. Why are you so quiet? Sis, leave now! Brother? Brother! No! No! No! - You reported me to the police. - I didn't! - I'll give you a sendoff with firecrackers. - No, let me explain! No! Help! Help! Help! Good night, master ping. - Sergeant, it doesn't look good. - Go see what's going on. Hey, sit down. - I'm police too. What happened? - Ok, come over here. His hand was blown up and he was shot in the back several times. Take the body away. Hey! Sit back down! It was poison snake ping. - Bro... - Do you want more trouble? Just sit still! - Brother! Brother! - Stop crying! Let's talk after we get back. Stop crying. Why cry? Your brother had a relatively easy death. He smuggled drugs. He was bound to end up like this. If you don't cooperate, you'll end up like him. Well? Did you hear what I said? - Bitch! You want to throw a tantrum? - A tantrum? If you wanted to arrest me you should have. Why did you tail me? Why did we tail you? To protect you! Protect me? Bullshit! I had a deal with mr law. Without you my brother wouldn't have died! Drug smugglers always end up dead, your brother was lucky. You caused his death yet you're jeering! You... Shit! Accept the consequences! No drug smuggler lives happily ever after! That's your fault! You didn't have enough evidence. Why did you hassle me? "Hassle me"? As if you're worth the hassle! Eat shit! Sergeant, she's a woman. I won't hit other women but this type needs a beating. Get some antiseptic! - Antiseptic? - It's in the kitchen. Still pretending? Get up! Go to hell! - Sergeant! Are you ok? - I'm fine. - Give me the antiseptic. - Sergeant, stop playing around. I don't want to do this! This bitch is forcing me! Go outside! Get out! - It's not a good idea. - Don't come back in until I say so! Fucking bitch! Get up! Selling coke, huh? Have some, then! Selling coke? Well? It's just cornstarch! But even that can kill you! Spit it out now! Who did your brother work with? Talk! - I don't know. - You don't know? Are you awake now? Think it over carefully. - Why are you out here? - Your brother is interrogating someone. Interrogating someone? You eat first, then. - Brother, the food is getting cold! - Wait outside for a bit! Michael, don't try anything! Here. Have a hot cup of tea. I haven't persuaded you to co-operate. Imminent death is what you're facing. Think it over. Sergeant, fuk shing water pipe manufacturer is a big business. If you're wrong you'll be held responsible. Yeah, can we trust Marie-Donna's tip-off? Yes but you have to be able to give her what you promised. No problem. We can get the plane ticket and reward money but it's her passport... - What? - You're crazy! With her background she can't emigrate! - It'll be very dangerous for her here. - I can't help her! No way! She's putting her life at risk! What am I supposed to say to her? I didn't make the laws, her royal highness did! So what can I do! If you had told me earlier then I would have taken your place! Fine! No problem! Take a seat! Are you fighting or working? I'll talk to the department of justice. I'll get this sorted. Call everyone back for a meeting. This time we'll get them all! Stay alert! Don't forget your bulletproof vest! Yes, uncle Jim. 3.5 million. Where's the merchandise? In the water pipe? You didn't expect that, did you? Bring it down! - Who are you? - Police. I'm here to enforce the law. Freeze! - Nobody move! Freeze! - Freeze! Freeze! - Well? - Freeze! Don't move! Freeze! Michael, what are you waiting for? - Sergeant, it's real! - I understand! Freeze! Freeze! Don't move! Freeze! On the ground, all of you! - Lie down! - Lie down! Stop the car! Hey, stop the car! Don't try to escape! Michael, don't let them get away! - Stand in front of them! - You can't escape! Michael, bravo! Michael, hold on tight! Be careful! Don't worry, I'm well known as an excellent driver in the force! Oh no, this is it for us! Where is he? There he is! Michael! Cuff him! You've been doing evil deeds long enough! Are you all right? - Would I be standing here if I wasn't? - Where's the criminal? - Underwater. Where's the other one? - I've cuffed him. He's back there. I'll watch for him. Call for a crane. Come on! Go! Go, go, go! Go! Up! Go on! Move it over there! That's enough! A little bit more this way, a bit more. Hey, there's no one in there. I was guarding it the whole night but no body floated up. Tell everyone, I want him arrested dead or alive. If you can't find the body, let's call it a day. Everyone, yesterday we acted on a tip. The ambush was led by chief inspector pak and I. Two groups of suspicious people were found there committing a transaction. Hey, you two just got back? - The press conference is starting. - That's not important. - The boss took all the credit. - I'm used to it. You'd better go in now. The market price for this large haul of drugs is hk$ 34 million. - The guns used by the criminals... - I'll step out for a second. Are better than what the police use. Hey! You two did very well indeed on this case! - See how happy our boss is! - Of course he's happy, but we're not. - Why not? - Come outside and talk. - I'm being photographed! - So what? Uncle Jim, what's going on? What won't wait until the end of the photo op? Why aren't we getting our photo taken? Now we won't get promoted! I've already recommended you and it's been approved. You're an inspector and you're a sergeant. We're going to celebrate now. - I'm going to get my photo taken. - Don't go yet! - What now? - You still owe us. - Now what? - Marie-donnal! That's right! All of Marie-Donna's stuff is here. - Plane ticket, passport, reward money. - Are they all there? - They are. - Then let's go! - Bye! - See you! It's very tasty, Donna! It's not that tasty, I haven't cooked in a long while. Will your brother like it? If it's to my taste it will be to his too. It would be ideal if you could be here every day and... - Cook for you two, right? - Don't you want that? Hey, see if the chicken is ready. You and your brother are both very nosy! Here's a toast! - Cheers! - Cheers! Sergeant, I hope you keep getting promoted! - Wait a minute - it's superintendent! - I see. - I hope you do too! - Thank you! Did you both get promoted? - We both did! - Congratulations! Wait a second. We need to thank miss Donna - she was the reason we could solve the case and get promoted. - Let me toast you. - No, no... I need to thank you two for giving me a fresh start, - I should toast you two. - No. - We should be the ones. - Can we eat now? - Yes. Let's eat. - Ok. Let's eat, then. - For you. - Thank you. It's good. The second I tasted it I knew my sister didn't make this! It's a shame Donna can't stay here. I'd love to eat like this all the time! Uncle Jim says your record isn't clean! He said it would affect my future! So what if I don't rise through the ranks?! It's not as if I'd die from it! But I'm a bad boy! I like sleeping around! I don't like being with the same woman! The person who knows me best is my sister. Right, Mimi? I do put my foot in my mouth. I'm sorry. But here's something to be happy about. Come on. What we promised you last time. Our superiors already authorised it. See? Australian passport. Plane ticket and reward money. Don't look at it now. Let's eat first. I'm going to miss Hong Kong a little. You don't have to leave now. You can stay a few more days. - Yeah! - My sister lives by herself anyway. Yes, yes. I'll get bored to death if I stayed here any longer! Hey! What's up with her? What? Is she happy or not? - She wants you to go after her. - As if! You've hurt her feelings! I didn't mean to. You took her plane ticket out - you're asking her to leave. What should I do now? - Go in and explain. - Go cheer her up again. Go on! I see. I understand. You two just want me out of the way. You badass! Come in. Hey! I was just joking. You're really packing? If I don't leave now, my flat will become so dirty it'll attract mice! I want to go home and start packing, then I'll visit my brother's grave tomorrow morning, and book a seat on an aeroplane. Still, you don't have to be in such a hurry. If I don't leave now, I'm afraid I'll lose control of my emotions. I understand. If you need anything when you get over there, write to me. - No, you've helped enough already. - You're talking nonsense again. Yes. I want you to promise me something. What is it? I'll only tell you after you promise me. Ok. Tell me. Less fooling around with women from now on! Ok? Ok, I'll watch my pennies from now on. - You're packed. Where are you going? - I'm leaving. - Leaving? - Yes. Donna, finish dinner before you leave. - Yes, finish dinner first! - No. See you at the airport tomorrow. - Ok, I'll walk you out, then. - Ok. Bye. Hey, behave yourselves, ok? I'll be back soon. My car is over there, I'll give you a lift. There's no need. I can take a taxi. - Are you sure? - No need. There's a taxi. I feel a little sentimental. - What will you miss? - You! Write to me if you have time. Mei foo, please. Look out! Brother! Michael! Brother! Michael! - Don't shoot! - What about Mimi? Let's see how Donna is first. Come on! - It's very dangerous! - It's fine! Here's an ambulance. Look! I heard gunshots, so I rushed down immediately. I saw Marie-Donna lying on the ground. - Let me answer the phone. Hello? - Mr li. - Who is it? - Are the cops there? No. Let me go into the bedroom to speak to you. - Where's my sister? - You're very concerned about your sister. - What do you want? - To exchange big brother for your sister. I can't authorise that. You can't authorise it? Should I burn her to death or have foreigners gangbang her? Don't do anything crazy! Brother, save me! Brother! Save me! Brother! Save me! No! - Mimi! - No! Brother, save me! Don't! Mimi! - Get away from me! - Mimi! Mimi! Pretty, your ass! Don't you harm my sister! Do you hear me? - Well? - Listen to me! If you harm my sister I'll kill your big brother! Stop! Ok, if you don't bring my big brother to us before dawn to 18 castle peak, the ocean windsurf equipment factory, to make an exchange for your sister, expect to collect a corpse! Hey, what did they say? They want to swap - their big brother for Mimi. Their big brother is already in the holding centre's hospital, we can't take him out! You want to watch Mimi die?! - What can I do? We'd all go to jail! - She'll die! So what? It's an emergency! You have to make the impossible happen! Sir, we're finished outside. Leave the scene, then! What do you want to do? Let go of me! I can't do anything about it! You can, it's just whether or not you will. - I can't do this! - Consider it returning a favour to my dad! - We could all go to jail! - For Mimi, we have to risk it! Let's go! - I'm going in for a bit. - Sorry, sir, we have no orders. There's been a new development. I have to get a new testimony. I'll take all responsibility. I told you I'll take all responsibility! - Hey! You're... - Shut up! - What? - Get up! Sergeant, it's very quiet. Stay calm. Brother, help! - Mimi! - Stay calm! - Where's my big brother? - Let my sister go first! Let him out! Get out! Cuff him! - Release her and I'll give you the keys! - Don't try anything! Let me go! Let her go! Drop it! Wait for me! Follow me! Freeze! Don't move! Where is my sister? Run for it! Fuck off! Go to hell! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! You come over first! Fucker! You want to make a run for it! Everyone inside, attention! You have been surrounded by the police! You have one minute to lay down your weapons and come out! - What shall we do now? Rush in? - Let's wait a bit longer. You two shitheads. Come over here! Take him back! Let's go! Chief inspector pak. Write up a report tomorrow. Do you know what to write? We sent out two brave cops and solved this international drug smuggling case, and I planned the whole thing - you could mention your name too. Prepare for a press conference. You heard him. Write me a report first thing tomorrow morning. Get ready for a promotion. Mimi, we got lucky! - Fuck you! - Take it easy! > You break all the rules! Wow! You seem like an old hand! > You're really beautiful! Hey! I pass out when I see you! > You're very competent! Hey! You seem to be the man! > You never say, "that's enough!” good! You always party to the end! > Why are you so cool? You're very good-looking, you've got what it takes! » tonight you have to give it your best to fight those guys! That's settled then! > Show me how cool you are! Show me how good you are! You are cool! Come take a look! > Even a tiger > even a tiger has to fight to the end! > Even a tiger, even a tiger
