* I'm going steady * With a dream * I'm going steady With a dream * The boy who's the hero Of the team * The other girls all tease me * They're jealous 'Cause they know * The school Prince Charming Is my beau * He gave his pin to me * Then tenderly * Taught me what it means To kiss * And when he parks his car * Beneath our star * We'll wish We'll always love like this * I'll be a lucky girl indeed * The girl most likely To succeed * The day when I will marry * The dream that I adore * The boy that I've been * Getting ready for * And we'll be going steady * Evermore Dad... The answer is still no. Oh... Now Gordon, the least you can do is discuss the matter with your daughter. There's nothing to discuss. The idea... a bunch of teenage kids going up to Reno for the weekend? You make it sound like a gambling spree. They're only going to a basketball... They're only going to a basketball game, and no 17-year-old daughter of mine is going gallivanting around the country to a basketball game! Dad, look, it's not just any game. Do you realize what an honor it is for Park Central High to be invited to play Temple High? They're the Nevada state champions! Oh, Daddy, half the school's going out to the game. And you are going to be among the half that stays in Pasadena. You'd think I was still a child! I'm 17 and a half! Older than some girls when they get married. You gonna bring up Aunt Lola again? Well, why not? Look, she was only 16 when she ran away to South America and got married. Why, it was the most romantic, the most beautiful... I just wish you'd forget about her. Besides, I pity the husband you ever marry. The poor fella. It takes a lot of doing to make a good wife, you know. Making beds, washing dishes. Things which you blithely allow your mother to do. Look, I'm not talking about housekeeping. All I wanna do is go to a basketball game! Now dear, tell me. What is it that worries you about this trip? Everything. You know what kids that age are apt to do when they get together. At a basketball game? You know perfectly well what I mean. There's going to be a dance afterwards, isn't there? But Dad, it's not as though I'd be going with a complete stranger, instead of Calvin Potter. Calvin who? Potter, dear. You remember. The tall, thin boy with the jalopy? Are there any other kind? Your daughter has introduced me to at least five hundred tall, thin boys with jalopies. But Dad, Calvin's different. We're going steady. - You don't say? - Mmm-hmm. And he's not only nice-looking and dreamy, and a B-minus student, and a careful driver, but, gee, he'd be the star of the basketball team! If the coach would only let him play. Sounds like a real talent. - Oh hi, Calvin. Come on in. - Hi, Julie Ann. Good evening, Calvin. Hello, Mrs. Turner. Mr. Turner. Father, you remember Calvin. Good evening, young man. Calvin, tell Father about your four new tires. Oh! They're six ply, safety-tread, nylon cord, guaranteed 20,000 miles... I am sure they're very nice... The rest of the car is in good shape too. I just had my brakes adjusted, my front... It's practically a new car. Is that it out there, the one being held up by the curb? That's it. Oh, Calvin, it looks like a lovely car. It'll make Reno without even breathing hard. I wish you godspeed, my boy. - Thanks, Mr. Turner. - However, Julie Ann won't be along. She won't? She's gotta be, because, well, if she's not there... The whole basketball team's expecting her. Calvin, I'm afraid they'll simply have to dribble on without her. But Mr. Turner, if she's not there, it just wouldn't... - I better go, huh? - Calvin, I'll call you later. I'm sorry, I... See you later, baby. That kid should do great in the housewrecking business. He's only clumsy like that around Father. Around me? Well, you terrify him! Maybe Calvin's a little clumsy, but at least he's a good driver. Hold it, hold it. For this tenth and last time, the answer is "no." And I don't care if his car has radar controlled. I don't care if he's been promised a police escort all the way from Los Angeles city limits to Reno! You are not going on that trip tomorrow morning! That is final! Mother... Dear. Give me a chance with him. Tomorrow morning is still a long way off. Oh, thanks Mom. We still have that record? Must be 20 years old. 21. We danced together to that in 1936 at the 4th of July picnic. Now they don't write music like that anymore. Makes you wanna dance, and... Hey. Care to dance, hon? I'd love to. Sure was nice of your dad to let you come. I knew he'd give in. But it usually doesn't take Mom till 4:00 in the morning to make his change his mind. My old man never cares where I go. What bothers him is I always come back! Hey, it looks like it might rain. Maybe we better put the top up. Ah, don't be silly. Never rains in California this time of year. I knew it! - Well, pull over so we can put up the top! - Oh, yeah. Time out for Park Central. Score: Temple, 67, Park Central, 64. Gee whiz. We're three points behind and only one minute left. If that coach would only put Calvin in... Are you kidding? Calvin's only scored eight points all season, and two of them were for the other team! I thought you were his friend. My loyalty is to Park Central High first. All right, Joe. Not you! Joe. All right! Let's hear it for Park Central High! One, two, three! P-A R-K C-E-N T-R-A-L - All right, you. - Thanks coach, you won't be sorry! Not you, Calvin! Calvin, come back here! It's Calvin, it's Calvin! Ah, now our goose is really cooked. Throw it! Not their side, our side! Hey Calvin, that was the shot of the century. Yeah! - Wasn't he wonderful? - Just lucky, that's all. Don't forget, Calvin, you promised me a dance. Okay, Anne. Calvin. You promised to dance with me. Well, um... Okay, gee. Okay, later. - Hello, Calvin. - Uh, hello there. Wow! A person would think you're public property or something! Hey, where we going? Someplace where all those jealous females can't roll their eyes at you. You know, Calvin, this has been one of the nicest days in my whole life. Me too. - Julie... - Yes, Calvin? Julie, I love you. I love you too, Calvin. - You do? - Mmm-hmm. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we could go on like this forever? Forever and a day. You know, right now... Right now I feel like Aunt Lola. Daring, and wanting to fly away on the wings of love. Oh yeah, the Aunt Lola who eloped when she was 16. Mmm-hmm, it was like in a storybook. With a beautiful, sad ending. Her husband died in South America, and he left her a lonely, beautiful widow. You know, that could be us if we were brave. - What? - Oh, I don't mean you have to die! Calvin? Did you know that in Nevada, a Justice of the Peace will issue a license, and... ...well, they'll marry you any old time. - Any old time? - Mmm-hmm. Here, hey. Sign right here. Right there. And give it to him. You sign here now. Right there, below her name. Don't suppose you, uh, brought a witness along either? No, sir. We're eloping. Oh! Well then. It's all right. Our temp, she can witness it. Ahem. Hold hands. Do you solemnly swear to tell the... Oh, yeah. Do you, uh... ...Julie Ann Turner, take this man to be your lawful wedded husband, to love, honor and obey, in sickness and in health, till death do you part? I do. Do you, uh... ...Calvin Ashley Potter, take this woman to be your lawful wedded wife, to love, honor and obey, in sickness and in health, till death do you part? I do. Uh, the ring. The ring! Oh, here, your school ring will do. - Here you go. - Put it on her finger. Oh yeah. Now, take her hand. By the power vested in me by the state of Nevada, I pronounce you man and wife. Well? Kiss her, son. Oh yeah. That'll be $5.00. Oh yeah. Have you children any place to stay tonight? Because it so happens our honeymoon cottage is available. You mean for the two of us? That's the way it usually is, son. Oh yeah. Only $8.00 till morning. Uh, well, all right. $5.00, then. $5.00. Well, uh, I'll go get the bags. You're supposed to carry her in, son. Oh yeah. Oh, here. Well, good night! Be sure and close the door when you leave in the morning. But Calvin! It's only a bed! Hey, Woody, there they are! Well, it's about time! - Hi, kids! - Hi! What happened to you guys? Fine thing. One minute you're dancing, and the next minute you've disappeared... Woody! He's so unsophisticated. All right, you two. Where were you? - Come on, hop in the car. - We'll tell you all about it on the way back. I padded your side of the bed with pillows, so Mrs. Paige thought you were there when she checked. Thanks, Olive. Julie Ann and I have something to tell you kids. If you promise not to tell a soul. Calvin and I were married last night. - Married? - Married? - Married? - On the level? - Right. - Oh, I think that's wonderful! Oh, Woody, they're married. Don't look at me like that, Olive. I'm only 17. I'm not even over my acne yet! We'll get to you later. Oh gee, kids, I can't tell you how thrilled I am. Gee, thanks Olive. Julie Ann, can I ask you a favor? Sure, Woody, what is it? Well, can I be around to watch your old man's face when you tell him? Gosh, we forgot about our folks! I'm not worried about Mother, but golly... Father doesn't adjust to new ideas very easy. Oh well. We'll think of something. Sure you will. Oh, by the way Julie Ann, does your father still have the hunting guns in the den? Well, we're back. Look, darling, I've been thinking. We already made Woody and Olive promise not to tell a soul. Suppose... Well, suppose we don't even tell our families. Never? Silly. Until after graduation. - Well, that's not until June. - Exactly! That'll give Dad four whole months to get to know and love you, like I do! Besides, golly, by then we'll be out of school and everything. You mean we have to go on living apart until June? Gee whiz. What's the use of being married? Oh darling, we've got our whole lives to be together. You two coming in? Oh, hi Dad! Now remember darling, try to act nonchalant, and please, put out a special effort to get on the good side of Dad. 'Bout time you two got back. I only hope I can find his good side. Hi, Dad. - Hello, dear. - Hi. Did you have much trouble getting out of the overturned car? The what? - Hello, Mrs. Turner. Mr. Turner. - Hello Calvin. Come in, Calvin. Gee, we had a terrific time. - Didn't we, Calvin? - Yeah! Gee, you know, Calvin was star of the game last night. - It was nothing. - We read about everything in the morning paper. That's it, ladies and gentlemen. - Everything? - Yes, that your shot won the game! - Oh. - How was the dance, dear? - Oh, wonderful, Mom. - Good. Reno's such a nice town. Did you go anyplace afterwards? Afterwards? Oh! Oh, no place to speak of. It's the main event. You children must be starved. I'll fix some sandwiches. - Both boys are undefeated. - Both have a knockout block. You know, this pictures keeps getting narrower and narrower... Guess I have to call a repair service tomorrow. Why do that? All you have to do is turn an adjusting screw in the back here. - Is that right? - Sure. Fix our set at home all the time. In this corner, wearing black trunks... How's that? The width is fine. However, the picture is now two inches high. And in this corner, wearing white trunks... Gee, Calvin, knobs are beginning to flip! Young man, perhaps you'd better let me... No wonder! You've got a loose wire here! All I have to do is attach the wire to this post... I guess I touched the wrong wire. - Oh... - Guess you did. Gee, I... ...I'm awfully sorry, Mr. Turner. I don't suppose that you'd like to come over to my place and watch the fights on the... Didn't think so. Oh Calvin, you're not leaving? I'm just fixing the sandwiches. No thanks, Mrs. Turner. I kind of lost my appetite. Well, uh. It was a wonderful weekend. Good night, Calvin. Hey, Mom? Is Calvin here yet? Not yet, dear. Again? Why doesn't he move in and get it over with? Now, Gordon... Don't "Now Gordon" me, Grace. Ever since they took that trip two weeks ago they been as close as Siamese twins. He picks her up in the morning. Brings her home from school in the afternoon. And he hangs around here every confounded evening. Aren't we even entitled to Saturday and Sundays off? I don't know what you have against the boy. He's polite. He's friendly. He's thoughtful. He even bought you a box of cigars for your birthday. Yes. Incidentally, I tried one of 'em. How were they? Grace, I think the boy is trying to do away with me. No, really, it's just that I have nothing against the boy personally, except that he's an idiot, of course. It's only that I think we should break up this relationship before it becomes serious. Oh darling, don't worry. Before Julie Ann ever gets married, she'll have dozens of steady beaus like Calvin. May the good Lord help us. Anybody home? Oh, hi Mr. and Mrs. Turner. Hello, Calvin. Goodbye, Calvin. Excuse me Calvin, I have something on the stove. - Hello, you husband, you. - Well, hello. Well, graduation's almost here. - I don't think I can last that long. - Sure you'll last. Look at the graduation gift you're gonna get. Yeah. Grace! The battery's dead. - What is it, dear? - I say, it's the confounded battery again. I'll be a half hour late for my appointment before I can get a booster here. - I could give you a push. - Oh, that's a pretty heavy car I have there. Say, uh, maybe Calvin could get a running start? It was only a suggestion! Don't mind them, dear, they're only men. Besides, the bumper of your car is too high to push me. Well, I've got a better idea. Since you're in such a hurry, you can use my car. Your car? Hey, that's a wonderful idea! Gee, we don't need the car anyway. We're just gonna sit around the house and listen to records. Well, I suppose I could. You know how to drive a car with a standard gear shift, don't you Mr. Turner? I think I can handle it. Oh, uh... ...there's only one thing. The car's been temperamental lately. You'll notice a lever marked "Choke." If the motor starts missing, don't pull it. You see, the last kid who... My boy. I have been driving for over 30 years. But you don't... In fact, my first car was an earlier model than this one. But Mr. Turner, there's a... there's a kid that... Okay, buster, pull over. What happened to you? Nothing to compare with what's gonna happen to you, wise guy. Now pull on over there. Yes, sir. Dad at least give Calvin a chance to come over and explain. Explain? He's fortunate that I'm giving him the chance to continue breathing! - Oh darling, he was only trying to help. - Look at this headline. Just look at this headline. "Blackout on Main Street." "Gordon P. Turner, prominent Pasadena hardware dealer, "pleaded guilty this afternoon in municipal court "to charges of creating the worst local smog condition "in the history of downtown Pasadena." And look at this picture of me in court! I look like Dillinger. Oh, who's that? - Oh, hi Woody. - Hi, Julie Ann. - Hello, Mrs. Turner. - Hello, Woody. Mr. Turner. - I see you've seen it. - Yes. I've seen it. Mr. Turner, I'm here in regards to a former friend of yours who's in trouble, due to a misunderstanding through no fault of his own. - A former friend of mine? - Yes, sir. And he asked me to explain to you that... ...that smoke screen deal was on the car when he bought it, and... Just a minute. Stop right there. ...and he tried to explain it to you... Now, Woody. You may tell my former friend that, number one, he can find his car parked behind the Pasadena Police Station. Number two, it has been rendered harmless by the local authorities. And! Number three, that if he or his car come over here again, I will not be responsible for the condition they are in when they depart! Well, I tried. Boy, it's a good thing I decided not to go to college. I'm too dumb to pass Latin and too small to play on the football team. You're going to chemistry class, aren't you? What's the use? Too upset to concentrate. Well, look at it this way. Maybe you'll make a mistake and blow up the whole school. Woody, it's a pretty sad state of affairs when a husband can only see his wife during school hours. Yeah, that's tough all right. Most of your classes aren't even together. Do you realize I can't even get her on the phone when her father's home? Oh jeepers, the enemy approaches! - But why not? - I can't, Beth... - Look, hold these, will you? - I can't! - Julie! - Hi. What are you doing here? You're supposed to be in English. I got excused early to go... Where's Woody? That little rat was supposed to meet me here for lunch, and he never showed. Julie Ann, we've gotta do something. These last few days have been miserable. - It's inhuman! - I know. In four evenings I've seen you once, when you went out to mail a letter. Look, Dad's bound to cool off pretty soon. Honey... Honey, I've been thinking. I think we oughta go to your father and tell him the whole story tonight. Please, Calvin, that wouldn't solve anything. Come on, Julie Ann. We're gonna be late. Where are you two going that's so important? Wouldn't you like to know? Look, Calvin, promise me you won't do anything foolish. I promise. Okay, Woody, they're gone. What's your combination? Woody? I found half a sandwich in here I didn't know I had. Hey! Hey, wait a minute, that's my locker! You little... I guess this is the place. Nervous? Yeah, a little, I guess. Let's go in. ...and as I was coming out of the dentist's office I saw Olive Nelson, going in to see a baby doctor! That's right. And Betty says she's positive it was Olive Nelson! And Joan said that Betty said she was positive it was Olive Nelson! Can you imagine? Olive Nelson, expecting a baby? My goodness, and she's not even taking Home Economics! Good. Now see if you can round up Woodrow Simmons and get him down here. That's right. Olive Nelson is on her way down, Mrs. Vick. The idea! A girl of her age. Mr. Ahern, I must remind you that at the last faculty meeting I said no good would come of longer lunch hours. Come in. Hello Miss Fisby. Did you wanna see me, Mr. Ahern? Yes, uh, sit down. Olive, I want to ask you a question. Are you... uh... Did you... Did you or did you not visit the office of Dr. Phillips, an obstetrician, yesterday? Uh, Dr. Phillips? - What's he look like? - Olive... - Yes sir. - Oh. And, um... Are you or are you not, uh... Were the results negative or positive? Oh, positive! But you see, Dr... oh, Mr. Ahern, - I only went there because, well... - Yes? Nothing. Come in. Yes, sir? Woodrow, you and Olive have been keeping, shall we say, steady company for several months now? I guess you could say that. I take it he's the father. I'm the what? Come in. Mr. Ahern? I'm sorry Julie Ann, but I'm busy right now. Excuse me, Mr. Ahern, but I think I know why Olive's here, and it's all a mistake. Boy, you can say that again. Mr. Ahern, could I speak to you alone for a minute? - Well, uh... - Please? Very well. Return to your classrooms, please. Thanks, Olive. Hey, what's going on, anyway? Well, now. Mr. Ahern, I'm the one who went to see the baby doctor. You see, well, Olive, she came along merely as a friend. I see. And you're expecting the baby? Yes, sir. I must say, you seem mighty proud of it. Oh, I am! It's my first, you know. I should hope so. And, uh, who is the father? Well, I'd rather not say, just yet. Well... uh... I'm afraid I must insist! Really, Mr. Ahern, I simply can't tell you. The father himself doesn't even know yet. Oh... uh... Well, Julie Ann, shielding the boy won't help matters. It's not that! It's just that, well, I felt that, with all his other problems, the shock would just be too much for him. He's a Park Central student, I presume. Oh, yes. Gee, he's a wonderful boy. I'm sure he's going to make a wonderful father. Miss Turner, I shall expect you to return here tomorrow morning. With your parents. My parents? But Mr. Ahern, they had nothing to do with this! Yes. Well, uh, nevertheless. I was afraid to tell you. Besides, I wanted to wait until maybe Father got to like Calvin a little better. Well, I can see your point. I'm sorry, Mom. I know you always expected to make my wedding dress, and... Believe me, Mom, I wanted you at my wedding, but... Oh honey, never mind. What's done is done. And besides, I think Calvin is going to make you a fine husband. You do? - Really, Mom? - Of course I do. I'm very fond of Calvin, and your father will be too. Oh Mrs. Turner, you are a peach. Well. I suppose we have to tell Father tonight, don't we? Yes, I suppose we do. Are you gonna tell him everything? At once? Well, that's something I'll have to decide. You just leave everything to me. Right now I have work to do. You know, it seems to me tonight would be a very good night to stuff your father with his favorite meal. - Enjoy your dinner, dear? - Oh. Delicious. Grace, there is nothing quite like your pot roast. Here, Dad. I thought these might make you more comfortable. Oh, thank you sweetheart. Well, this is my idea of a perfect evening. Just had my favorite dinner, I'm surrounded by my favorite family, and I'm about to light up one of my favorite cigars. What's the matter, dear? It's one of those cigars that Calvin gave me. I'll say, speaking of Calvin, it's been nice and quiet around here recently. Don't let it worry you, dear. You'll miss his attentions for a few days perhaps, but one of these days you're gonna meet some nice, normal young man. Father! What'd I say? Um, Gordon, there's something you should know. Grace, has that boy been coming around here again? - Oh no, dear. - Well, that's good. Say, there's an article in here about Abner Priestley, he's going to be the guest speaker at Julie Ann's graduation. Gordon, Julie Ann and Calvin are married. We went to school together, you know, then he went up to San Francisco, became a very successful insurance executive. I said that Julie Ann and Calvin are married. Grace, that is a feeble attempt at humor if I ever heard one. They were married that weekend in Reno. That's nice. Good man to listen to, that Priestley, you know. He's a self-made man. Well, I must say, you're taking the news nicely. Grace, you are joking, aren't you? You mean that they're really married? That my daughter is married to that... ...teenage idiot? - Now, dear... - I don't believe it! Darling... Julie Ann! You may as well accept it, it's an accomplished fact. Do you mean that my daughter and that boy are... - Yes... - Oh! Potter, Potter, P-O-T, Potter... Hello! Mr. Potter? This is Gordon Turner, Julie Ann Turner's father. Yes, I know I'm yelling! Now you listen to me. You get your wife and get right over here, and bring that... ...that monster of yours along! Gordon, acting like a madman will get you nowhere. That's better. - Now, please, let me finish. - Finish? Oh, don't bother. Nothing can top your last news flash. Very well. I'll see how Julie Ann's getting along. Grace. Now you know what can happen at a basketball game! So. - Good evening, Mr. Turner. - Come in. Uh, Mr. Turner? This is my mother and father. How do you do. And this is Mrs. Turner. How do you do. - Won't you come in and sit down? - Thank you. Oh, well, it is a nice evening, isn't it. You! Now, dear... Calvin told us all about it on the way over here. Oh, well you know that your son took my little girl to the next state on the pretext of seeing an innocent basketball game, and... - You fiend, you! - Good heavens! Gordon, please. Right over here. What's done is done. All we can do is treat the matter constructively now. Well, they did get married. But the fact remains that they lied about their ages, and they got married without our consent. Now why my daughter would do a thing like this, I do not know. Insanity does not run in our family. However, that's beside the point. The only thing to do is to get an annulment quietly and rapidly. But I don't want an annulment. I like being married. We don't like being married to you. That's not true! I love Calvin. And Calvin loves me, don't you Calvin. Gosh, honey, you know I do. Now, Julie Ann, that's enough. You are getting an annulment. Now just a minute. It seems to me that we should have something to say about this. Oh, yes, you should have something to say. Why don't you tell that child-snatcher of yours to come to his senses too! He's no child-snatcher, he's a good boy. - Ha! - Ha yourself! You and your daughter can just consider yourselves lucky to have him. Lucky? Inheriting... this? You've called him all the names you're going to. I have some pride! George! Wait a minute, will you two remember you're grown men? Well, he isn't. Not if he thinks those two kids can stay married. Dear, there's a slight complication that makes an annulment quite impossible. - What? - Julie Ann's expecting a baby. A baby? Did you hear that? I'm a father! I know all about it, dear. A baby? Do you realize what you're saying? But that's ridiculous. That boy, the father of my grandchild? Grace, I just won't have it. You won't have to, darling. Julie Ann's quite capable. Me! Calvin Potter! I'm a father! Well, not quite. Why me? I've led a good, clean life. Never cheated in business, and always given money to charity. Why did it have to be me? It's frightening the way children grow up so fast nowadays. Just a year ago, Calvin was so active in the Boy Scouts. Um, congratulations son. - Thanks, pop. - Thank you. Well, I think the only practical solution to this problem is for Calvin to move in here with us. Until graduation. Me? Move in here? Well, uh... Gee Mom, I think that's a wonderful idea! Well, after all, you are man and wife. I think you should live as man and wife. Does my suggestion meet with your approval Mrs. Potter? Whatever Calvin likes is fine with us. Yes, but... ...I'm afraid that Calvin can be a little absent-minded once in a while, if you know what I mean. So please don't let him forget to... ...to brush his teeth, now will you. Ah. No. Uh, about my moving in here. How would it be if Julie Ann and I got a little room someplace? Now, only at first, mind you, and... A little room someplace? No daughter of mine is about to live in a little room someplace. Calvin... You know, setting up housekeeping nowadays is an expense. And you are still in school. Things will be different later on. Gee, Calvin, we'll have a great time living here. Sure, I know, I just... It's all set, then. I suppose you might as well get your things and move in tonight. Tonight? Gee, Calvin, did you hear that? Oh, my dear. You're just the prettiest daughter-in-law that anyone could ask for. Thank you, Mrs. Calvin. I think Calvin's a very lucky boy. Thank you, Mr. Potter. Calvin, you'd better come home and get your things together, dear. Good night, Mr. Turner. Mrs. Turner. I'll see you out. - Good night. - Good night, sir. And it started out to be such a nice... quiet evening. - Hi! - Oh! No! - Calvin, that's quite a load. - Oh, this is nothing. I'll bring over the rest of my stuff tomorrow. Come on up, Calvin. Okay. Put it under my chin, would ya? Thanks... ...Dad. From the looks of it, that boy thinks that getting married is like joining a fraternity. Now, dear, we're going to be all the help we can. Yes. You never spoke a truer word, my good woman. Gordon Turner, what are you plotting? I'll tell you what I'm plotting. As soon as that big oaf unpacks, I'm going upstairs and I'm going to have a talk with him. I'm going to tell him precisely what is expected of a son-in-law of mine. Darling, the least you can do is to give them the chance to work out their own problems. Work out their own problems? Dear, do you realize that they're still adolescents, they're still in school? All right. So they had to run off and get married. Now they're going to find out about the facts of life. It's awfully quiet up there. Gordon, you've got to make me one promise. And that is that you'll give Calvin at least a few days to get settled. Before you have that little talk with him. All right, I'll give him a few days. But let me warn you, Grace, that I... Uh, does this marriage have your parents' sanction? Oh yes. Calvin even shares my room at home. Mr. Ahern, there are a few things I'd like to discuss with you. To begin with, we feel that we should be in the same homeroom until graduation. The same homeroom. Yes, and we'd also like to be in the same Algebra, Chemistry and English class. Well... How about gym class? 'Course, gym is a thing of the past for Mrs. Potter. Mrs. Potter! That's the first time anybody ever called me that. - Oh, darling. - Come on. Well, I must say this is all very irregular. Mr. Ahern, as one husband to another, surely you must approve of a student's desire to be in the same classes as his pregnant wife. Naturally, Mr. Potter! Uh... Calvin. What's happening now? Mr. Ahern's wiping his forehead again. Isn't it romantic? They're actually married! And expecting a baby! I'm so happy for them. Now, there are just one or two other little things. Oh yes, Mrs. Potter will need a break... around 11:00 each morning for cookies and milk. - Oh Calvin, I don't think that's... - Now, Julie Ann. Oh yes. Mr. Ahern, have you ever thought of starting a course at Park Central on how to be a father? More corn, son? No thanks, three helpings is plenty. Hasn't Calvin a marvelous appetite? Remarkable. I'm preparing a ham tomorrow, would you care to watch? Whatever for, Mom? Well, I sort of thought it was time you became interested in preparing some new dishes. I will Mom, but what's the hurry? Calvin loves your cooking, don't you dear? I sure do. Maybe it wouldn't be a bad idea if you watched how your mom does it. Oh, stop talking like a husband. - May Calvin and I be excused? - Yes, of course, dear. - Oh, Julie Ann... - Yes, Dad? Would you mind asking Calvin to cut down on his bath time a little? Say, to only one hour or so? Sure I will, Dad. I'm sure he doesn't mean to inconvenience you. Every time I want to get in and lather up and shave, or wash up, that kid is in there soaking himself. What's he trying to do, shrink? You know, I do wish Julie Ann would take the job of being a wife a little bit more seriously. I'm more worried about her husband. Grace, do you know, in the past four days I've seen that kid eat more food than I do in a month? No wonder his family's glad to get rid of him. He's a bottomless pit. He's an enthusiastic, growing boy. Grace, I'm going to have to have a talk with that boy before that marriage gets completely out of hand. Darling, they've only been living together four days, give them time. I see the handwriting on the wall. What does that boy know about marriage and providing for a family? The only experience he's ever had is dribbling a basketball. He is going to be a father. Yes, and I'm going to be a grandfather. And no daughter of mine is going to end up in some, some... ...midnight mission with my grandchild. Calvin... Father's a little upset about your spending so much time in the bathtub. He is? That's too bad. The bathtub's the only place I've ever been able to do my English themes. I'm afraid you'll just have to try someplace else. After all, we're inconveniencing Dad enough as it is. I know that. And Julie, I don't think it's fair to either your father or me, our living here. Your dad's being imposed upon, and as for me, well, here I am married, and I have to act like a son or something. After all, Calvin, it is his house. Exactly. And that's the reason I think we should get out... - I hope I'm not interrupting anything. - Oh, 'course not, Dad. Where'd this come from? Oh, they're the ones I gave you. I found the box shoved under the sofa, I figured you'd mislaid them or something. Oh, Gordon's been looking all over for them, haven't you, dear? Oh, yes. All over. - Here, I'll light it for ya. - Oh, that thing doesn't work. Aha, I fixed it! Thank you, Calvin. Nothing like a pure Havana cigar, is there? Julie Ann, would you care to help me clear the dishes? Okay, Mom. Calvin, I think it's time that you and I had a little man-to-man talk. Yes, sir. Now, to begin with, I'm not too happy that you and Julie Ann got married, and especially so young, but you are married. And so, I'm going to help in any way I possibly can. Uh, that's very kind of you, sir, but I feel that as soon as I graduate I'll be... No, no, Calvin, just a minute. Marriage is a serious business. Yes, sir. As I started to say... And I don't suppose that you have anything in mind for your life's work. Not exactly. I figured that I'd get a job after school and then, in June, make up my mind about a permanent occupation. Maybe real estate, or insurance, since I like going out and meeting people so much. I'm not worried. You may not be worried, but I am. Young man, do you realize that you're still in school, and that my daughter is about to have a baby in less than six months? Gee, Mr. Turner, I'll take good care of her and the baby, believe me. What people hope to do, and what they accomplish often turn out to be two different things, Calvin. Sure, I know that. And so, Calvin, to make sure that what you hope becomes a reality, I'm going to take you into the business. - The business? - My hardware store. Daddy, that's wonderful! Well, of course he'll have to start at the bottom, as an apprentice clerk. Gee, thanks, but... Oh now, don't thank me, Calvin, and don't begin to think that the hardware business is easy. Like all business, success is composed of hard work, long hours, and, above all, the will to learn. Well, that sure is swell of you, Mr. Turner. But, um... well, to tell you the truth, I've never really been too interested in working in a store. Calvin! This is an opportunity you can't afford to miss! Oh, thanks Dad. Well, I'm glad someone seems enthusiastic. Calvin, you'd better start working at the store after school. There's some 10,000 items in inventory to be learned by heart. Honestly, Calvin. Look, all I said was, "Won't it be nice when we have a place of our own." You as much as said you don't like living here. Julie Ann, I don't get it. Sometimes you act as if you're afraid to leave your mother and father and live alone with me. The idea! Oh, Calvin Potter, that's not it at all! Well, what is then? And what's more, you are being narrow-minded, unappreciative and unfair! Unfair? Look, all I said was we should stop imposing on your folks and get a place of our own. Especially now that I'll be working. I see no reason why we can't go on living here. At least until after graduation. I thought you wanted to be like Aunt Lola. Free, running of to South America on wings of love. We can't afford to go to South America. Don't get me wrong, I like it here. But I just think that... well, we are married, and I think married people should try to be alone a little bit more than we are! That's right. We are married, and right now I feel like being alone. Good night. Our first quarrel. I wouldn't let it worry me, Calvin. Little arguments come up in every marriage. By tomorrow morning, it'll all be forgotten. What about tonight? Oh, tonight, oh... Oh, I know, I'll sleep in with Julie Ann, we never get a chance to talk anymore anyway. Where will he sleep? I'll just change the sheets, and you two can have our bed. Oh well now, just wait a minute, Grace. Calvin and me? In the same bed? 'Course! That's all right, I'll go sleep on the sofa in the den. - No, you certainly will not. - No, no, no, I'll sleep on the sofa. Nobody's going to sleep on that sofa because the way it curves, you wouldn't get a wink of sleep. Well, I'll go and wash up. Okay, dear. Grace, if you think I'm going to sleep in the same bed with that, that... Good night... ...Dad. Good night... ...son. What is it, Grace? Oh. I hated to wake you up but, um... you were snoring something awful. Well, if it isn't my two favorite hardware executives. - How's everything down at the store? - Oh, fine. Yeah. Swell. Come on up, Calvin. - Uh, how's Calvin... - Don't ask. Don't ask. After 10 days at this store, that kid doesn't know the difference between a 5/8" wood screw and a 3/4" steel flat top. Grace, he is hopeless. - Oh, I'm sure he's trying, dear. - Very trying. You know what happened today? A woman came in looking for a plumber's friend. Calvin asked her what the man's name was. Darling, Calvin told you he wasn't interested in the hardware business. He is going to learn the hardware business and like it if it kills both of us. And it might. Yes, bill, bill, bill. Water bill. Same old stuff. Binder Weed Mortuary? What's this? Oh, it's the children's report cards. They sent Calvin's here too. B, A, A, - B, A. - Good, aren't they? Hi. This is a very good report card, young lady. We thank you. Here are your grades, Calvin. C, C, C, C-minus, D-plus. I thought old Fisby would give me at least a C-minus in Latin. - Oh, it's not bad... - Calvin! Those grades are simply disgraceful! - Really, Gordon. - Well, they are. Four C's and a D! I don't think they're that bad! So Calvin doesn't get very high marks. Grades aren't everything. - Of course not. - Thank you, but... Well, I don't need anybody to apologize for my grades. Young man, grades reflect both ability and interest in learning. Now how would it look if Julie Ann graduated from high school this June, and her husband flunked out? - What would you say to that? - Well, who's flunking? You might! Unless you start using that head of yours for a change! Mr. Turner... I lived with my parents for 18 years, and they never spoke to me in that tone of voice! Why, I'm sorry, Calvin. I guess I'm a little overtired. He didn't mean anything by it, dear. He just thinks of you as a member of the family. Sure, sure. I just wish that certain people would start to realize that I'm a man, not a child. Gee, Calvin's certainly getting touchy, isn't he. Dear, growing up is often a very painful process. As you can see, it's rough on the parents too. Aunt Lola! You've changed! You're a whole lot prettier! Thank you... Mom! Dad! It's Aunt Lola! Lola! What are you doing here? When you told me that Julie Ann had married and was expecting, I just had to come! - Well, if it isn't Lola. - Gordon. You've put on a little weight but I... ...I must say, it becomes you. Oh, just look at her! Now tell me all about... Wait a minute. I got a little soap on you. - Oh no! - I was going to shave. - Thanks. - Oh, doesn't she look beautiful. Where's that Calvin that swept our Julie Ann off her feet? He left the store early to go and get a haircut. It was two and a half hours ago. Oh, he'll be right back. This is for you, honey. A wedding present. Thank you! A little late, but all the luck and happiness in the world. Oh, thank you, Aunt Lola. Take it upstairs, honey, and open it when Calvin gets back. Let's not stand here, let's go and sit down in the living room. - Where are your bags? - At the airport. - Oh, Gordon will pick them up later. - Good. Sit down and tell us all about your trip. Nothing to tell. Took a sleeping pill on the plane, when I awakened I was here. Just can't believe she's married and everything. She is, all right. Decided to take after you. - Gordon! - You don't seem very pleased. You'll understand when you meet her husband. Bad enough that he's a boy. He has to be mentally retarded also. Oh, that's not fair. Now, look, The kids gets married without money, without experience, without a job, without anything. And what do I do? I take him into my business. I give him a home. I treat him like my own son. Does he appreciate it? No. Perhaps he's like to be on his own. He would starve on his own. And my daughter with him. Hi. Sorry I'm late, but... - Oh! Lola, this is Calvin. - Hello, Calvin. Aunt Lola! I sure have heard an awful lot about you. Good, I hope. I'm, uh, sort of a black sheep in the family. Hi, sweetie! - We've been expecting you. - Hi, honey. I would've been here earlier, but... - I got a job. - A job? Calvin, I was under the impression that you already have a job. Well, I was given a job. This new one isn't much, it's only a job working after school until graduation But it's a job I got all myself. Oh darling, that's wonderful. Now, how many young men Calvin's age have two jobs? If you'll excuse me... Of course, you want to freshen up, I'll take you upstairs... - No, I know the way - Oh yes, of course you do. Young man, just what kind of a job is this? Clerking at Walton's Market. This is beyond me. If you're going to work at this grocery store, how are you going to have time for the hardware store? Well... Well, I'm afraid that I won't be working at the hardware store. - You won't? - Calvin, are you sick or something? No, I never felt better in my life. Look, I don't mean to appear ungrateful. You people have been great about everything. But, well... ...I've decided that I'm just not too interested in the hardware business! Well! And I've also decided that Julie Ann and I are going to move into a little place of our own after graduation. Get out on our own like other young couples. The boy's irrational! Calvin, you're just being stubborn! Other kids our age would give anything for the opportunity Dad's giving us. Well, we're not other kids, and I'm not interested. Well, I am! Julie, Julie, I love you. I love you very much, and I always will. But it's no good this way. It's time for you to decide whether you're going to grow up and be a wife, or remain a little girl for the rest of your life. I was afraid of something like that. Well, could have been worse. Could have had a cake in the oven. Here you are, Woody. Are you sure you won't eat with us, Calvin? No thanks. Four out of five nights is plenty, even if your mom is the best cook in town. Are you going to sleep in this car again? Why not? I've got all the comforts of home, right here. My clothes, a radio. Heater, blankets, a pillow. - Where do you wash up? - In the gas station. I take showers in the gym at school. I don't get it, Calvin. Okay, so you left the Turners because of a matter of principle. Why don't you move in with your folks? Woody, a married man doesn't run home to his mother. Why don't you go and make up? They were looking pretty sad when I went to pick up your clothes yesterday. It's not as simple as that, Woody. It's funny, you and me being such good buddies. We're exactly the opposite. What do you mean? Well, the only way I'd get married, is if they threw in a free place to live and a job. Go home! - Bye-bye. - So long, Woody. Woodrow... No one shall look at this examination until I give the word. Everybody ready? You have one hour in which to complete your final examination. Go. - Good luck. - Thank you. Silence, please. Oh, my goodness. What is it, Julie Ann? I think I felt a little twitch, or something. A twitch? Mrs. Armstrong! Stop the examination! - What? - Call a doctor! Don't move, honey. Everything's going to be all right. - Calvin, please. - Boil some water. Quick! - Boil water, oh dear! - Calvin! Calvin, it's just a little twitch, it's not for six months yet. Six months? Well, uh... Don't these things happen early sometimes? Calvin, I am perfectly all right. - The idea... - Julie Ann. In case you've forgotten, I happen to be the father. Thank you for your interest. You're welcome! Would someone mind bringing me a glass of water? I think I'm going to faint! Well, how does it look? Let's just say that my daughter will be the most beautiful gal at that graduation tomorrow. There now, take it off, dear, and I'll stitch it up for you. Gordon, could you take that back in the kitchen? - Oh, Julie Ann. - Yes, Daddy. Don't worry, honey. Calvin will come round to our way of thinking. At the moment, Father, I really couldn't care less. Gordon, how are you going to realize that we're not going to be around to protect her the rest of her life? Grace, now that's exactly why I'm helping the kids while we are here. No daughter of mine is going to scrimp, and to do without the way you did when we got married. Oh, really... Don't you see that the scrimping and the doing without when we were young, this gave our lives the meaning. Oh, nonsense. Look, you built up that hardware business from a mere hole in the wall, and you're proud as a peacock of your accomplishment, and you've every right to be. That's the chance that Calvin's asking for. Just to be allowed to be responsible for his own success! Grace, I'm only trying to give him the benefit of my own modest success. Now, is that so terrible? If I could just make you see what you're doing. You're keeping our daughter from standing on her own two feet, as a wife, and later, as a mother. Don't wait up for me tonight. Oh, Lola. You look beautiful. I have a date with Abner Priestley. - Oh. - Abner Priestley? He's here to speak at the graduation exercises. Oh yes, I know, I know. I just didn't know that you two were acquainted. He's a very important man. And quite charming, may I say. Well, have fun, dear. Good night, Lola. Good night, you lovable old Gordon. Abner Priestley. Wonder how she met him. Well, it could be that he met her. I just hope that she remembers to behave like a lady tonight. Why shouldn't she? Lola's the... ...impulsive type, you know that, Grace. Gordon Turner, I'm just beginning to realize something about you. What's that? In every way, in your attitude toward Lola, toward the children, toward everything, you're as old-fashioned as outdoor plumbing! I'm what? You used to have some fire, some courage... ...once. Now you're just a... ...an arch reactionary! Now look here, Grace... To put it bluntly, you're a big square! Well! I don't have to listen to this. What are you looking for? I've found them. They're my earmuffs that I wear to the mountains on hunting trips. Ohhh! A very good idea! It's apt to get quite chilly sleeping on the sofa. In the den! Seymour Club. Olivia Manners. Olive Nelson. Julie Ann Potter. Calvin Potter. Thomas Pound. Mary Putnam. Janet Randall. He'll straighten out and come back, now don't worry. Then you'll change your tune to me. You won't think I'm such a monster. Gloria Ridge. Are you listening to me? We're all listening to you! Nancy Silver. Woodrow Simmons. Meryl Simpson. Ladies and gentlemen, we are indeed fortunate to have with us today as our guest speaker, Mr. Abner R. Priestley, founder and president of the Acme Insurance Company of San Francisco. Mr. Priestley! Mr. Ahern, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls. This evening I would like to say a few words on one of my favorite subjects, a subject the importance of which cannot be overestimated. I call it the task of growing up. Thinking back to the time when I myself was about to go out into the cold world, I can still remember my mixed emotions. I was apprehensive. I was a little scared. Scared, did I say? I was terrified. And yet, at the same time I was eager. I was apprehensive because the time had come to throw off the cloak of protection given me by my family. I was scared because I knew not what lay before me. But above all, I was eager because I was on the threshold of adulthood. That marvelous, frightening, exciting stepping stone of life which separates the men from the boys, the successes from failures. Without doubt, the most important stepping stone of our lives. The stepping stone that each mother's child must someday be prepared to tread, and the one which modern parents unfortunately have a tendency to dread. Yes, it is difficult, terribly difficult, after being a carefree student, to accept the responsibilities of adulthood in the outside world. I repeat, it is difficult. But as parents we can't forget, and as newly crowned adults, each of you must remember this proven fact. It is those who gain that necessary maturity and independence of thought and action who achieve success. Not only in our business world, but in their personal lives as well. Gee, sure sounds successful. I wonder if he's got a daughter. Calvin! Darling, can you ever forgive me? Forgive you? Sweetheart, I've acted like a spoiled brat. From now on, you're the boss. Now you listen here, this family has no boss, it's strictly a partnership. I'll even learn to cook. Even if it kills both of us. Well, please don't start practicing until after little Junior comes along, huh? Abner! Thank you, Mr. Priestley. - Did I leave anything out? - The speech was just perfect. Well, let's hope it reached the right people. Who would've suspected when you suggested coming up to my hotel room that night that your motive would be to rewrite my speech. I like those kids so much I had to do whatever I could. You're quite a remarkable woman. Perhaps next time I come down... Mr. Priestley... Well, if it isn't my two young married friends. Mr. Priestley, we can't tell you how much we enjoyed your speech. Golly, it was simply... ...simply super! That's a compliment if I ever heard one. Gracious, look at the time. Goodbye, Lola. Or shall I say, if we meet again? Have a nice trip, Abner. Mr. Priestley, you said that young people our age should be mature in order to be successful. - I did. - Well, look at me. Here I am only 18, and I not only have a wife, but I'm practically a father, and I graduated less than five minutes ago! Don't you think that makes me mature? Calvin, I'd say that makes you outstandingly mature. I wonder where Julie Ann disappeared to in such a hurry. I was wondering the same thing. Um... ...Grace? Yes, Gordon? I've been a fathead. Oh? What about? Oh, you know very well what about. It's those two kids. I should have kept out of it. Priestley was right. Much as I hate to admit it, you were right. I was wrong. We all make mistakes, dear. Mine are such lulus, though, real lulus. I just hope that marriage isn't botched up permanently. You know something? I have a feeling it's being mended right now. I hope so. You know, Grace, it's not easy to admit at the age of 47 that you don't even have sense enough to know what's best for your own daughter. Darling, you're wonderful. It takes a real big person to admit he's wrong. Then you're not angry at me anymore. Grace Turner, I'm very glad that I married you. Are you sure you're not buttering me up just so you won't have to sleep on the sofa anymore? Could be. I don't like it very much. Neither do I. Necking again! Oh, Julie Ann. Where have you two been? - Hi, folks. - Hi, dear. Hello, Calvin. It's nice to see you. Very nice. We have some terrific news for you. Tell 'em, Calvin! - You tell them. - What is it? Calvin cornered Mr. Priestley, and got a job with the Acme Insurance Company! It isn't much to start, but I'll be learning the business from the ground up. - Oh Calvin, that's wonderful news. - Thanks. Congratulations, son. Of course, we'll have to move up to San Francisco, but that's only at first. That's because the main offices are there. - San Francisco? - Ah, so what. That's only a day's drive from here. Insurance, eh? Well that's a fine, lucrative profession. And Priestley is certainly the man to learn it from. I've always been interested in the insurance business. Ever since my Uncle Dave collected $10,000 just because my aunt died. - Hi, everybody! - Hi, Olive! - Guess what? - What? - I'm engaged! - Olive, that's wonderful! Come in here, whistle bait! I'm lovely, I'm engaged... How'd it happen, Woody? Oh, I proposed, and... well, after a small chase, Woody accepted. I believe it. I've been planning it for years, you know. We even have a place to live! Yeah, all I have to do is cut two acres of grass a week. - You mean you... up in the garage? - Uh huh. Gee, come on kids. Let's go, we'll be late for the dance. Don't pull the material! We're not married yet, you know. - Excuse me one second. - All right. Incidentally, Dad... Yes, Calvin. Don't renew any of your old insurance policies until you talk to me, huh? - Okay, son. - Good night, folks. Good night, Calvin. - Bye, honey. - Good night, dear. - He's a nice boy, isn't he? - Yes, he is. Only I hope he never buys me another cigar. * I've been a lucky girl indeed * The girl most likely To succeed * For I'm so glad I married The dream that I adore * The boy that I've been Getting ready for * And we'll be going steady * Evermore
