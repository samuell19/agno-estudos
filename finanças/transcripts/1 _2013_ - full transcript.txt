I didn't have a bru/se on my body. I didn 'f have anything at all. I looked up, and I saw a red flag. That's /uckyu fhey've stopped the race. Back then, we had the restarts, and... also we had spare cars, so your mind goes, "Get in the spare car. ". And new ear plugs! (man) Yes, okay. And new gl... and new gloves! (Brund/e) And so, you can 'f start until you've seen Professor Wafkins. "Where's Sid? Anybody kno w where Sid is?" I ran towards him like crazy. I got there, and he said, "I can see you're okay. I've just wafched you run 300 meters. What's the date?" I said, "It's the 10th of March. ". He said, "Then you're fine. Get in the car. " (Brund/e) There is no doubt about if. A few years before, I would have been a dead man. (Brund/e) We want to see something except/anal, breathtaking, that we think we can't do. We want to see g/adiafors, Warriors. And /ez”s face if, we do like to see a bit of a show. But we don't want to see deafhs. (ma/e reporter) Miracle of miracles! This is well nigh unbe/ie vab/e! Martin Brund/e gets out of the car, and he's seemingly a/I right. (Brund/e) If is incredible how this changed, and suddenly if became unaccepfable to die in the name of sport. JJ” (narrator) Grand Prix is like the Olympics of motor sports, with the cars in a/I national colors, blue for the French, green for the British, red for Ita/y, and white for the Germans, until Mercedes stopped using pain! On those silver arro ws. (ma/e reporter) Michael Schumacher wins and becomes the most successful Grand Prix driver of a/I lime! (ma/e reporter) The silver cars that are the pride of Hit/er Germany. (man) Alfa Romeo wins, driven by the fabulous Nouva/ari. (ma/e reporter) What a feeling for Fernando Alonso! He wins the Italian Grand Prix af Monza. (man) As the French announce their search for the fastesz' man in a new world championship series to be entitled Formula 1, with the inaugural race to be held at Silverstone. Enzo Ferrari for one is no! Impressed with the new wave of British motor racers. Ll Commendatore has labeled the new independent designers "garagistes", the men who cannot build engines. Fangio is beaten in Buenos Aires by former feammafe and fastesz' rival, Stirling Moss, in a Cooper funny car, no less. What Courage by these men, to push these cars and themselves to their very lim/fs! But that is Formula 1. (ma/e narrafor) Formula 1 was born in a bygone time when boys' heroes reigned in the sky. (Nigel Manse/I) When you're young, you wanted to be a Formula 1 driver. You wanted to be an asfronaut, you wanted to be a fighter pilot. (Damon Hill) After the Second World War, the mindsef of going off and doing something courageous in a vehicle, this just naturally flo wed into what became Formula 1. (Martin Brund/e) when you see photographs and film of that era, the seriousness of them is awe inspiring. I grew up in that world. My dad was world champion '62, and I was two. They a/I had this genuineness about them. They all were the real article. (John Watson) / certainly had respect to those that went before me. Some of them were my confemporaries. I me! One time probably, in my vie w, the greatest Grand Prix driver ever, and that includes people like Michael Schumacher and A yrton Senna. Fangio. Fangio. Fangio. Fangio. Fangio. Juan Manuel Fangio. (narrator) The first big name in Formula One may ha ve been the best driver ever. Fangio would win five world iii/es, a record that sfood for 40 years, surpassed only by Michael Schumacher. (Schumacher) Whene ver you drive those cars that Fangio had to race in, it's very sca ry. (Fiffipa/di) You have to hold yourself on the steering whee/. No safety belts. The helmet was just like a hat... gogg/es... and you had to be bra ve. (narrator) The most celebrated driver in a dangerous time... survi ved. The year Fangio ref/red, 1958, the Formula changed. The sporfs governing body announced from Paris that Formula One would crown two world champions each season. One title for the fastesz' driver, and another for the manufacturer of the fastesz' machine. (Mario Andreffi) This was the evolution, you know? Each team has to fake engines, take chassis and technology to the absolute limit. (narrator) /n this ne w competition, The British began to challenge the Old World continental po wers. (John Bernard) AI/ the English feams were considered to be the garagisies by Ferrari and the other racing teams. (narrator) One Englishman would se! The pace of progress, in racing and the entire automat/ve world. (Co/in Chapman) We basically go racing 'cause I like if. I like the compefifiveness of if, I like the comradeship of if. And I also like the technical fallout that comes from it. (John Surfees) Colin Chapman was a great character, if at times a bit cavalier. (chuckles) Oh, I don't know about that. (narrator) Colin Chapman was an engineer who learned to fly, an enfrepreneur who made /ighfweighf sports cars for the public, as well as for Grand Prix under the name Lotus. In those days, Lotus was an ouf-and-out racing car. (Clive Chapman) My father, he was always push/ng the en ve/ope. Good engineering means you've designed something to its limit. Colin was the ma verick of a/I time. He was a genius. He was the team owner that you want to drive for. (narrator) By 1963, Chapman had designed the fastesz' machine in Formula One. And he had the fastesz' man behind the whee/ of a Lotus. (Sir Jackie Ste warf) Jim Clark was the best racing driver I ever raced against. The whole exercise was to be as good as you can get on the limit. And Jimmy drove in such a way that he was ne ver over the lim/f. He was ne ver errafic. He was ne ver specfacu/ar. He was specfacu/ar/y fast, but in an unspecfacu/ar fashion. If was smooth and clean and beautifully hand/ed. (narrator) He would win more Formula One championship races than any driver before him, finishing in second place only once in his career. (Sir Jackie Ste warl) He was a country boy. He was a farmer from the borders of Scotland, quiet and almost innocenf. (Jim Clark) I'd like to get back here much more often. It's, uh, great re/axafion to get back here, And very much the opposite from racing. (narrator) Clark became the face of Formula One, with another champion, Graham Hill, playing his affable foil. (Damon Hill) E veryone was quite close. Jim Clark had been to our house, and I knew Colin Chapman sort of the same way as I knew my dad. They sounded the same, and they had the same mustache. (Sa/ly Swart) Colin was an extreme exfro vert, great fun to be with, but very different in character to Jimmy, really. Jimmy was quieter. But they were like brothers. (narrator) Together, they were racing on the lim/f of manmade speed and ingenuity. They won four world Championships between them, and a record five British Grand Prix. But for a/I their success, they failed to fake the checkered flag at the most famous motor race of all. (narrator) Fast cars and courageous sou/s from a/I over the world have been racing through these Streets since 1929. (Damon Hill) Monaco is ferrifying. You cannot be/ie ve it's possible to hold a motor race round Monaco. (Jody Scheckfer) In the first few laps, you stick your head up to see where it went, 'cause it's just guardrails that you can't hardly see. You're millimeters away from barriers. (Jensen Button) You either do a /ap that you're so proud of, you're always wondering if you could ever go through that again, or you end up in the wall. (Lewis Hamilton) The danger aspect to this is one of the parts that drives us racing drivers. It's something we love. (narrator) One man mastered these Streets like no other driver in history. (Jo Ramirez) Monaco was a special place for Senna. He was the best in the world. (Jo Ramirez) His concenfration on one /ap was just uncann y. (narrator) A yrton Senna won Monaco a record six times, one more Victory than the man with the derring-do mustache. Graham Hi/I came to Monaco in 1966 to defend his third straight Victory. (Graham Hill) It's a fremendous race and a great one to come and watch, and if anybody's going to come and see a Grand Prix, this is really the one. It's such a nice place to be an ywa y. (Stirling Moss) To come to Monaco and talk to men is a waste of time, so excuse me. That's when motor racing was really dangerous, and sex was safe. (Mario Andreffi) Sti/I today, what defines Formula One is the sense of prestige. It's an event. Kings want to be there. (Princess Grace of Monaco) For me, it's a fhril/ to see an expert at work. Upon meeting Graham Hill, you like him. Watch/ny him made me become more interested in racing and what these men were doing. (narrator) /n those days, Hi/I's fiercest rivals were also his closest friends. [chatter and laughfer] (Sir Jackie Ste warl) The inf/mac y was incredible, from the racing drivers to the mechanics to the wives and the girlfriends. The camaraderie was very deep. (Sir Jackie Ste warl) We went on holidays together. We //ved together. We fra ve/ed together. (Br/gifte Hill) You felt very much part of this family gro wing up together. Motor racing was just a part of it. (narrator) The drivers farmed a trade union, the Grand Prix Drivers ' Association. The women soon followed suit with the Doghouse Club. (Damon Hill) Well, the doghouse club is where I was kept growing up with the wives and girlfriends of drivers. What do they call them now? Wags, I think. (Br/gifte Hill) Betty Brabham sfood up at one dinner, and she said, "Jack's in the doghouse. ". And they all realized they were all feeling very much the same way. (Sa/ly Swarf) They were always playing with engines or something like that, and not paying nearly enough attention to us. (Bette Hill) The fact that he's going to work a/I night on his car, and then it's going to break down after two laps. You have to love this man to be a good wife of a racing driver. (Br/gifte Hill) The wives did the /ap scores, and that would decide the grids, because there was no real sort of official time keepers. These kind of s/ighf/y romanfic memories that everyone's got of the whole thing. (Br/gifte Hill) We just were a clan to ourselves. (narrator) They fra ve/ed by cara van, to wn to to wn, country to country, for six months straight. Even the most celebrated drivers raced in the lesser Formula Two series in the off weekends to keep this family Circus on the road. (Mos/e y) / dro ve Formula Two with Bruce McLaren and Jochen Rindf and Jackie Ste war! And Jim Clark, all sorts of top drivers of that era. I got the shock of my //fe because they were puffing the brakes on at about the point going into the corner that I was taking them off. (John Surtees) There is a point where you don't think you should fake if beyond, when you're on the edge, and you're just pushing your luck a little. (Mos/e y) The problem is, when you push if to the lim/f, it's irresisfib/e, and as soon as you've done if, you want to do it again. (narrator) The charismatic young Italian, Lorenzo Band/ni, racing for Ferrari, died after a fiery crash af the 1967 Monaco Grand Prix. This was the beginning, when the evolution of the machines began to overtake the standards of the tracks. The seeds had already been so wn for an upris/ng within the drivers' ranks. Just months before Bandini's death, the FIA changed the formula for enfrance. (Max Mos/e y) They doubled the size of the engine and more than doubled the power. (Sir Jackie Ste warl) They were just racing on the same tracks as they had done almost pre-war. The racefracks hadn? Changed. The medical facilities hadn 'f changed. The marshaling hadn 'f changed. And suddenly the cars were going almost twice as fast. (narrator) That same year, Colin Chapman con vinced the mighfy Ford Motor Company to Invest in a powerhouse engine for his new, even lighter design. He signed Graham Hi/I to drive for Team Lotus, a/ongside his old riva/ Jim Clark. The number one man in motor racing started selling space on his racing machines, like billboards in motion. Sponsors meant money. Money meant making belter cars. He'd paint the car any color you wanted, as long as he could have more resources to realize his ideas. (narrator) For the 23 drivers in the grid, sponsorship meant exposure. Soon, every boy's hero was a racer. (Maurice Hamilton) My first real hero was Jim Clark, no question about if. To me, he was the guy I would like to have been. (narrator) One of Jim Clark's first drives in the red-and-go/d colors of Gold Leaf Tobacco was in Germany. (Max Mos/e y) If was a Formula Two race. If was 1968, at Hockenheim. In April. And I was on the grid. [P.A. announcements in German] [P.A. announcement in German] (Sa/ly Swart) The whole world stopped when that happened. (Damon Hill) You don't understand when you're young what's going on. But I remember watching the television when Jim Clark died. (Blue Peter) As you have probably heard, yesterday Jim Clark, racing driver Jim Clark, was killed in Germany. I believe he was a friend of yours. Yes, he was a good friend of mine, Peter, and I think, you know, I'm very sad about it, and everyone involved in motor sport all around the world will be very sad. He was a very fine driver, wasn 'f he? Yep, I think one of the greatest, perhaps, uh, perhaps the greatest yet. (Sa/ly Swart) /t was a deflating tire, that's what Colin thought. He was really, really de vastated. He was never quite the same after that. (Co/in Chapman) This is the fragedy of motor racing, is when you do get close to a driver and there is an accident, of course if... if hurts you so much more. He was, I would say, my best friend, best friend I've ever had. (Max Mos/e y) There was no barrier, and the car went in full speed info the frees. I'd always explained to my wife that as long as you were reasonab/ y careful, it was all perfectly safe. (Sir Jackie Ste warl) We suddenly realized that if Jimmy died, [Sigh] God, anybody could be killed. (Sir Jackie Ste warl) /n 1968, we had a driver die every month on the same weekend for four consecutive months. And we were racing on the fifth weekend in circumsfances that we should ne ver have been allowed to go out in. You cou/dn 'f see 60 meters of visibility because of the fog and the heavy rain. And the very first question I asked when I got out of the car was, "Is everybody okay?" (Max Mos/e y) /f you spoke to the FIA or the organizers and you said, "This is really very dangerous, " fhey'd say, "Well, if you think motor racing's dangerous, "slow down a bit. Don 'f drive so fast. It's entirely up to you. " (Sir Jackie Ste warl) They were blind to the real/fy. They didn 'f know those drivers. They didn't know the drivers' wives and the drivers' fathers and mothers. (Max Mos/e y) / thought to myself in those days, if ever I get info a position of any power in this world, I will do something about it. (narrator) One month after Clark's funeral, Graham Hi/I climbed back info his Lotus and won the Spanish Grand Prix. (Damon Hill) What my dad did with Lotus, he re-galvanized the team by no! /effing this fragedy be totally desfructive to everything. (Max Mos/e y) /n '68, Graham Hi/I went on, and he still won a world Championship. [cro wd cheer/ng] (Max Mos/e y) And you just realized this was another world. The drivers could just go on. Some just don't care about risk. (presenfer) Down from the Via/one, 185 miles an hour, four cars virtua/I y together, and down to the Parabol/ca they come. Can Ste war! Hold the line on this, the last /ap? Somebody's cha//engingu it's Rindf going through! Jochen Rindf takes the lead in the Parabol/ca, on the last corner of the last /ap. And it's going to be a fringe factor to win. If must be! /z”s... iz”s over the line together! And it's almost a dead heat! It's Jackie Ste wart, Rindf, Bella/se, and McLaren! Nobody has ever seen the finish of a motor race like that! I won the race by about this much, from Jochen Rindf. And the crowd went absolutely bananas. They sudden/ y were on top of us, and the police were trying to keep them back. We ended up by locking ourselves in a tai/et! And they were still outside banging the doors, trying to get in. [cro wd shouf/ng] There was no more enfhusiastic a cro wd of specfafors than that of the /ta/ians. They really follow the motor racing with a passion. They're so spirited, fhey're so enfhusiastic. From that point of view at Monza, it's certainly the capital of the world. [opera singer singing in Italian] (man) It's one of their beloved Ferraris in the lead, and another of them in second place. The fifosi a/I around me are erupf/ng. The Ferrari flags are flying. The counfing horses are count/ny. And Michael Schumacher wins in Ita/y! (narrator) Since 1929, Ferrari fans have come to Monza. The tifosi, fens of thousands strong, cheering, Cry/Dg, for a German, or a South African, or an Englishman. The Italian fans stormed over and lifted me up and carried me down to the podium. If was incredible. In my early years, / sfrugg/ed to sort of understand what if means, Ferrari. Yeah, okay, it's a race car. Yeah, right, it looks good, but didn't understand about the history. Enzo Ferrari, il Commendatore, created a a' ynasty. In the first two decades of Formula One, his powerful engines had delivered six championships. Ferrari had also lost six dri vers. [speaking Italian] By 1969, Ferrari, like every other team on the grid, was chas/ng Chapman and Lotus info a bra ve new world. (Sir Jackie Ste warl) Suddenly, we were running biplanes. (Max Mos/e y) When the wings came, if was a step change. The aerodynamics gives the fire more grip. That enables the car to go faster round the corner. Obviously, the drag from the wings makes the car go slower on the straight, but peak corner/ng speeds went up. (Mario Andreffi) Obviously, as you increase the corner/ng speed, things become more dangerous. This was the evolution of the sport. You cannot stop progress. (narrator) The first team to fake advantage of aerodynamics was Lotus. (Herb/e B/ash) / remember Colin Chapman arrived at 4:00 in the morning, and he'd suddenly had this dream... huge wings. (narrator) /n Spain, at the second Grand Prix of the '69 season, Chapman ordered his mechanics to expand the wings the morning of the race for his defending champion, Graham Hill, and his new driver, a German-born Formula Two star named Jochen Rindf. (Eddie Dennis) We could see from the pils the wings appear to start to buckle. Graham's went first. One of the boys ran back to try and signal Jochen's car. (narrator) Rindfs wings collapsed at the same turn in the track. Hi/I escaped unhurf, then foughf to pull his young feammafe out of the wreckage. Rindf suffered a broken nose, a fracfured ja w, and shatfered confidence in the man building his cars. /f Jim Clark had been like a brother to Colin Chapman, Jochen Rindf was like a petulanf son. (Eddie Dennis) Jochen had a few ups and downs with the o/d man. (narrator) Orphaned when he was just 15 months old, he assumed his family inheritance at 18, and started buy/ng racing cars. A2' 25, he married a fashion model, Nina Lincoln, the daughter of another racer. (John Miles) Jochen was acerbic, ap! To react very sfrong/ y to situations. [speaking German] (Eddie Dennis) On one or two occasions, Rindf wouldn't actually drive one or two cars because he felt that the design of the car was unsafe. (Max Mos/e y) Drivers, when fhey're young, they will drive whatever you give them. Jochen Rindf was complete/ y different. (Eddie Dennis) / can remember at one point he put a dollar sign on his helmet. He was looking for someone to buy him out of his contract. (Max Mos/e y) Jochen, he had this m ysterious manager cal/ed Ecc/esfone. (John Miles) Rindf and Bernie were always playing cards, and he had a sort of a live-wire, sort of businessman feel about him. (Herb/e Blash) Bernie could handle Colin Chapman. Normal/ y people went up to Colin and they were more or less on their hands and knees. He wanted Jochen to drive a car that Jochen didn't want to drive, thought it wasn't safe. They had a few argumenls over that. AI/ these cars were super light and probably no! Safe. It was certainly going to be quicker. (narrator) /n 1970, Chapman un veiled a ne w-look Lotus for his sfee/y young driver that would bring Formula One info the modern age. (John Miles) The wedge shape, the side radiatorsu if was a/I highly advanced and amazingly... fragile. [screeching fires and crash] The car was being developed at race meefings in the back of frucks. A lot of things fell off, broke. (John Bernard) The whole safety thing wasn? Even an issue. Let's no! Beat around the bush, a designer's first requiremenf is to make it fast. Being quick comes first. (narrator) One month info the 1970 season, Rindf se! Aside his reservafions and sent Chapman's new Lotus roar/ng info the history books. (Sir Jackie Ste warl) Jochen Rindf and I were the two fastesz' drivers, that'd be fair to say. I saw a lot of the back side of his car in 1970. (narrator) They came to Monza with almost twice as many points as the second place team, owner/dr/ ver Jack Brabham. A2' practice, we often decided to fake the wings off the car. If was a/I to do with straight-line speed. At Monza, you gained more down the straight. (Eddie Dennis) 75 percent of the drivers fake the wings off. The wings were off my car, and the car was absolutely, for me, undrivab/e. It's the first time I've been really, really frightened in a racing car. Jochen felt the only way he was going to go really fast was to get rid of the wings and sort of hang the consequences. (Eddie Dennis) But the 72 had ne ver been raced without wings. (Sir Jackie Ste warl) / ran back to see Nina, his wife, to tell her what was happening, but I didn't know what the situation was with Jochen, but I certainly didn't want to worry her. Bernie and I ran down to the Parabolica to see what we'd find. Jochen had gone by then. (Eddie Dennis) If comes over you that you're the last person they talked to. You search your brain to see if there 's something that you've done wrong, but Jochen, he said, "Leave the wings off, " he said, "for sure. " [speaking German] That you would stop racing. [Rindf laughs] (narrator) One of the first men to openly question the safety of his sport was silenced at the age of28. Two months later, his widow was awarded the world championship, the only posthumous title ever won in Formula One. Thelesson of Jochen Rindt was that had he had even basic proper medical attention, he would have survived. (Sir Jackie Ste warf) The Grand Prix Drivers ' Association had a really good articulaled vehicle with everything on board. The people did no! Put him info that vehicle. They took him to the wrong hospital, and the time he'd got to the right hospital, he'd died. (narrator) Jochen Rindf was the third Formula One star to be killed that season. Bruce McLaren was killed at Goodwood. Ninefeen days later, Piers Courage was killed in the Dutch Grand Prix. (Andreffi) Those were fragic times in so many ways, because we 'a' lost some icons of our sport. (Ecc/estone) He had an accident. As far as the world knew, that's what happened. He had an accidenf and got killed. And nobody really looked behind it, wh y the accidenf happened and could somebody have done something to stop if happening. (Mario Andreffi) If always took some kind of a fragic event for us to say, "You know what? We can do better. ". We're getting smarter and smarter about these cars. We're able to make them go faster. Why can 'f we use the same know/edge to make them safer? (Keon Vergeer) There is a parallel between Formula One racing and space. As a kid, I followed a/I the moon miss/ons. (NA SA fechnician) Five... four... three... two... one. /gnifion Sequence... (NASA fechnician) Liffoff/ We have a /iffoff/ (Koen Vergeer) If was the same time they sent men in rockets to the moon. They are carrying fire inside these machines. They are driving over the edge... info new worlds, getting beyond boundaries. Also about //fe and death. [specfafors cheer/ng] (Koen Vergeer) And that's Formula One, too. You knew when the season started, one or two of your heroes would be killed. (narrator) Koen Vergeer was among the legion of boys worldwide who became obsessed with Formula One during its most Violent decade. He was just 11 years old when he saw his first race, the Dutch Grand Prix at Zandvoorf. (Koen Vergeer) We went there by fra/n, and you go info the sand of the dunes. And nothing is organized... no signs at all, nothing. You can be lost in the dunes, if you want to. And after a half an hour, you find the track. (John Hogan) /n the early '70s, Formula One was really a little bit of a circus act. (Maurice Hamilton) You'd go to a Grand Prix. Uni/I the cars cars came out to practice, you wouldn't know who was going to turn up. (Padd y McNally) Each team would negotiate with the individual promoters at these various circuits. (John Hogan) /n fact, the organizers paid the broadcasters to show the Grand Prix. The whole business was much more informal in those days, so even as a fan, you could literally go into the paddock, and there were your heroes. (Koen Vergeer) Jacky /ckx was my hero. He had his mysterious name. (narrator) Jacky lckx, the baby-faced Belgian, with Ferrari in 1970, was the one driver who could have caughf. Jochen Rindf for the championship. In truth, /ckx came per//ous/y close to becoming the fourth casualfy of the season. [spectators screaming] (Jacky lckx) Being burnf is one of the most painful things you can ha ve. You can be broken, you can have a/I sort of things, But being burned, it's really... it's terrible. I ne ver thought if could happen to me. It's not going to happen to me. You always think it's going to happen to the other driver, not to you. It was never going to happen to me. (Sir Jackie Ste warl) A lot of drivers have the phi/osoph y that it's always someone else who has an accident, it's never themselves. But of course you're always on the very fh/n line between survival and even disasfer, or certainly death. (narrator) Jackie Ste war! Had a huge accidenf at Spa. He was frapped in his car ups/de down, and he was soaked in fuel. (Max Mos/e y) The great fear was fire in those days. Those cars were a/I effecfive/y a mobile bomb because in an accident, the fuel went everywhere and caughf fire. (Nigel Roebuck) When Jacky had his accident, no one was wearing seatbelts. That's because they preferred if they hit anything to be thrown free from the car. It's proof of how amateur we were... organizers, teams, and drivers. (narrator) Both Jack/es had been caughf out and escaped, only to become abso/uie rivals in the re vo/ufion. (narrator) /ckx won at Zandvoorz' in 71, while the other Jackie won his second world title. We were in total opposifion. Pure competition. (narrator) The flying Sco! Became cha/r of the Grand Prix Drivers ' Association, and as world champion, the de facfo leader in the upris/ng. You're all wearing seatbelts because in these cars, an unfastened seatbelt is no good. (narrator) While Baby Face refused to join the union. Jacky was no! A be/ie ver in the safety movemenf. (John Watson) Jackyjusf didn 'f want to be part of the GDPA because if didn 'f quite suit the image of Jacky lckx. [vintage audio] (Jacky lckx) / was no! Part of if because that's the way I am. (Nigel Roebuck) What he didn 'f like was fhreats. You know, "We will not race tomorrow unless you do this. ". You know, union fact/cs. (Max Mos/e y) The FIA in those days was very weak, and an ywa y the FIA cons/sted of the organizers, so there was no proper Organization. (Sir Jackie Ste warl) For me, if was a very simple, black-and-white case. You know, we had to get the race tracks themselves to recognize they needed to do more, had to put more fenc/ng up or more barriers up. It was all costing money, and they had never had to spend the money on the race track before. (narrator) Ste war! Became the new face of Formula One, as sfee/ armco barriers were installed at places like Zandvoorz' and Silverstone. Max Mos/e y became a consfructor and team owner with March Engineering. Bernie Ecc/esfone joined him in the paddock as an owner, after bu ying Jack Brabham's old team. And on the wings of aerodynamics, a new stable of young guns arrived to fil/ the empty dri vers ' seals. We were very aware then that the drivers had massive respect for each other because they kne w, a bit like fighter pilots in World War ll, that they might not come back. There was Jody Scheckfer of South Africa, the quiet Austrian, Niki Lauda, John Watson of Northern Ireland. Other British hopefuls, James Hunt, Da vid Pur/e y, and Roger W///iamson. The super Swede, Ronnie Peterson, the American playboy Peter Re vson, whose family created Re v/on Cosmetics, and the Renaissance Man from France, Francois Ce vert, handpicked by Ste war! For team owner Ken Tyrre//. [speaking French] (Sir Jackie Ste warl) He was like a young fighf/ng cock. He was enormously good looking, had an incredible pair of eyes, and, uh, did a lot of damage with the young ladies. (Jo Ramirez) Francois absolutely /do/ized Jackie. (Padd y McNally) He was almost up to Jackie's standard at that time. We had probably one of the strongest feams that would have been in motor racing. Everything I knew about the sport, I was passing on to him. What do you think about Emerson as a pilot? Who? Emerson Fittipaldi. Who? You know, the guy who won the world Championship. Oh, yes! Ha ha! (narrator) Colin Chapman had his fourth world champion in eight years, a brilliant young Brazilian named Emerson Fiffipa/di. (Emerson Fiffipa/di) We were, like, 21 drivers establish/ng Grand Prix racing. Your odds are 7-fo-1 to survive. Colin fold me, "Emerson, / don't want to get too close to you," "and you know the risk you have." "At any time, / can /ose you. " (Chapman) Cevert's going to be your danger, I reckon. You beat him, I reckon you'll win the race. That was Colin Chapman. (John Watson) My first Grand Prix was in Silverstone, the British Grand Prix. Graham Hill walked into the room, it was like... almost like a god walking in. But if you can 'f compete with them and get info that car, and go out and literally "put your cock on the block," then you shouldn't be in it. (man) The cars now coming up onto the grid, and fhey'// only be held there for seconds before the flag fa//s and the start of the race. (Scheckfer) A2' the beginning, you were just trying to prove to yourself and to other people that you were fast enough. (man) The flag's up. (man) Jackie Ste war! Going through on the inside, behind Ronnie Peterson. Jackie Ste war! Made a blinding start. It's sti/I Peterson, just holding Ste war! Out as they go through copse for the first time. (Jody Scheckfer) What a driver is there for is to fake if to the lim/f and keep if at that lim/t, and that's in every part of every corner. It's keeping it right on that limit. (man) And then Francois Ce vert. Jody Scheckfefs lost if. Jody Scheckfer has been hit, a multiple shot at the end of the first /ap. Jody Scheckfer, with the McLaren. (man) They're stopp/ny the race. Here comes Jackie Ste wart, ferrib/ y fast, and Ronnie Peterson coming up, ferrib/y fast. (Scheckfer) It's a lot of adrenaline's gone info you, and you're near/yjust laughing a/I the way to the pils until you tell the guys what the bloody hell happened, you know? Eleven cars ref/red, but no one was killed. Very lucky. Silverstone, which was one of the biggest, if no! The biggest accidenf in Formula One, brought if home to me... to win, you've got to finish. (man over P.A.) Two minutes to go... The next race was the Dutch Grand Prix at Zandvoorf. (Vergeer) We were up on a hill because my father could film very good from there, and then you could walk down to a fence. Behind the fence was the armco. As a kid 11 years old, I want to be in that vortex of sound and color. [engines roaring] (Koen Vergeer) The sound goes through your bones info your stomach some where, and I remember the first time I saw the cars coming. I thought, this is my world! (narrator) Eight /aps info the race, there was a single-car collision with the ne w/y installed armco barriers. (Koen Vergeer) / saw a car flying through the air, and I looked straight info the cockpit. But if was in a flash, and the car shatfered on the aspha/f. 1973, when I had March, it was Roger Williamson. One of our cars. He was a close friend. (Jo Ramirez) Da vid Pur/e y stopped his car, got off, and he was trying to lift the car. And there was all... lots of people just watching. Nobody came to give him a hand, and he was desperate. (Sir Jackie Ste warl) We passed if every /ap. Yellow flags were being flo wn to slow us down, but the race was never stopped. In those days, they didn 'f stop races. (Jo Ramirez) Jackie was probably the greatest ambassador the sport has ever had, and he was a great pioneer of safety, but if he had to drive, he would jump in the car and drive. (Sir Jackie Ste warl) When the visor goes down, you escape from the grief, the dramas, the froubles, the pain and suffering. And if was only when you came back, you know, the visor went back up, that real/fy, you became aware of, again. (man) W///iamson's dead. There's no /ap of honor. Quiet presentation. It's clear that, in racing, we are a/I the same. In life, we need just some extra luck. (Koen Vergeer) For me, at 11 years old, if was ferrifying, but also fascinating, what was happening there. I think they thought we were g/adiafors, and if you went into the Coliseum, you knew there was lions in there, and that chances are you wou/dn 'f get out. (Koen Vergeer) I really began to cry, but at the same time, I thought, how can you cry about someone you knew nothing about? (Max Mos/e y) He was an ordinary working-class /ad who'djusf done if by his own talent. Those things have a big, big effect on you. (narrator) The year Roger Williamson died, the FIA established mandafory on-frack rescue equipment and fire regu/afions. By then, the Doghouse Club was raising money each year for the families of fallen drivers. (Max Mos/e y) Because there were things that could be done, maybe if was immoral, but on the other hand, / cou/dn 'f say, because there were people who wanted to do it. (narrator) The only requirements to replace the fallen on the grid were gufs and money. (man) Lord Alexander Fermor-Hesketh, the third baron of Heskefh! Lord Heskefh was 22 years old when he farmed Heskefh Racing. (I ord Heskefh) / got info racing enfire/ y accidenfa/I y. I'd just me! The preffiesf hooker I'd ever, ever met in my life, and I saw this posfcard counter, and if had this charm/ng feddy bear. I drew onto the feddy bear a crash he/mez' and a Union Jack. (ma/e spectator) / think if has an afmosphere of the old-type Grand Prix feams, and, uh, I think that anything truly British deserves Supporting. (I ord Heskefh) We were there to have some fun. That was about if. (Maurice Hamilton) They were s/ighf/y upper class, weren 'f the y? Lord Heskefh and so on. The more serious journalists thought that one didn't come in and do Formula One racing like this, and drinking champagne and having fun. Not on. (man) We don't want any pictures, we don't want any pictures! Ha ha ha ha! (I ord Heskefh) We've got a driver in F2. He hasn? Got a very good reputation, but he is very, very fast. His nickname is "Huntman Shunf, " 'cause he tends to crash cars. (John Hogan) If was no! Dissimilar from a man owning a very expensive horse, and his jocke y happened to be James Hunt. You want to... you just want to get a level? So if/ say "shuls and fuck" and a/I that sort of stuff. Oh, dear. Well, cancel if, then. Can we rub that out? (Jody Scheckfer) He drank a lot and smoked a lot of funny things. He had his fun. He had girls to die for. (John Watson) He was the kind of thing you'd read in your com/c when you were a kid gro wing up and dreaming of being a Grand Prix driver. James was the epitome of everything a kid would want to be. (Jane Birbeck) James was so affracfive as a person. He noz' only affracfed girls, but he also affracfed a lot of... a lot of, uh, men. I mean, I don't mean like that, But he just had that ability to charm people, and freedom within himself, that some people found a little unnerving. (woman) When you go around with these racers, you start to know almost everybody here. It's like a big family for you, and you get your big interest with. (Emerson Fiffipa/di) If was a lot of fun. /f was a fransifion in the world of young people... the sideburns, the be/I bottom frousers, the hippie time. (narrator) Four hours west of Woodsfock, New York, Formula One hosted an outdoor party every year for two decades. (Maurice Hamilton) E verybod y used to stay af a place cal/ed The Seneca Lodge, which was a Hunting /odge. With a/I the American whoopin ' and ho//erin', it was a great scene! (narrator) The Glen had a reputation as a place for champions. Jochen Rindf won his first Grand Prix here, as did Emerson Fiffipa/di. Francois Ce vert won in 1971, and was runner-up in '72, to his mentor. In 1973, the Tyrrell team came to the Glen with Jackie Ste war! Having already wrapped up his third world championship. (Sir Jackie Ste warf) By 1973, I had decided that my last race would be Watk/ns Glen, my hundredfh Grand Prix. (Jody Scheckfer) Jackie's refiremenf was sti/I hush-hush at that time. (Sir Jackie Ste warl) Only three people kne w. Francois didn 'f know, or even Helen. I didn't want to fell my wife, "because I didn't want her sa ying, "If it's this dangerous, "why don't you stop now, and then we'll be happy?" Oh, it's a fantastic feeling, even the other one, because, uh, the roof thing I've got is so smooth and de/ighfful, it's even a nice impression for the driver. You know, it's... Vrroooom! Very...! Ce vert was sort of thinking he was ready to be a number one driver in his own right. He se! Out to prove if in qualifying that year, at the Glen. [vintage audio] Ce vert. Blood y hell. [Sighs] (Jody Scheckfer) / was the first one on the scene, and /jumped out the car to try and help him. I remember then trying to get his belts, and then just turned around and I knew if was a/I over. [vintage audio] It was the most horrible sight. Iwouldn't want anybody to see that, ever. (Jo Ramirez) Nothing broke in the car. It was just going too quick. He hit one barrier, then he went across the circuit, hit the other one, and that turned the car over. Maybe the barrier would have been a little bit higher, then he would have been okay, but we will never know. (man on P.A.) Because of the Incident on the circuif, practice for today for Formula One cars is now concluded. (Emerson Fiffipa/di) Wen! Back to the pils. I didn 'f say anything to Colin, to my wife. I just walked info the parking place, where there was nobody. And I want to pray with God and say, "What I'm doing here? Help me." (man over PA) Genflemen, remain standing, please, for the playing of the national anfhem of France, in memory of Francois Ce vert. [La Marseillaise playing] (Sir Jackie Ste warl) / chose no! To race the next day out of respecf to Francois. Nothing to do with my own personal concerns. If was an unfortunate way to end a career, but in the other way, maybe if was part of wh y / ne ver wanted to race again. (Roy Topp) / think if was the right thing, no! To race. Very sad. (Sir Jackie Stewart) / was just so angry that the sport could do if in this way, and continue to do if in this way, and not sufficiently change itself, to put its own house in order. (John Watson) There's about 15 minutes or so before the race, so I was hang/ng around the pils, and Bernie said, "Well, what are you doing? What are you doing?" I said, "Well, Francois's dead. ". He said, "Well, so what? "He died doing something which," "up until that fracfion of a second," "was giving him the greatest joy, pleasure, fulfillmenf." "You're a racing driver. Get out and do your job. " (Francois Ce vert) Every man in the world is looking to make from his passion his business. That's what I have done. I cannot be more happy. Everything I do about my auto racing, I enjoy if. Anything. Because if is my passion. (I ord Heskefh) When the guys flying the Mustangs came back in from five or six hours over Germany, and they probably lost 75% of the format/on, they went to the bar. And they went to the bar with a very good reason. [re ve/ers whooping] Sometimes you have to get up in the morning, look in the mirror, and say, "Are you prepared to put it on the line?" "Are you prepared to actually lose your life today?" Because if you're not, you have no right being there. (Emerson Fiffipa/di) I said to myself, "I need to forget everything that happened before," "because I love this sport." [specfafors cheer/ng] (Jo Ramirez) If is like a drug. Once you get in if, it's even more difficult to get out of if. (narrator) /n 1974, Emerson Fiffipa/di began to fil/ the Void left by Jackie Ste wart, both as the fastesz' man and the voice of reason. JJ”. While sfee/ armco now ringed most circuits, two more drivers had been killed after collisions with the barriers... the American Peter Re vson, and a young Austrian driver in only his second start, Helmuth K oinigg. (Max Mos/e y) The marshal/ appeared with his he/mef. His head was still in it because he'd gone under the barrier and it just took his head off. It was like it was a nightmare. (Emerson Fiffipa/di) I remember Barcelona. Friday morning, after practice, I saw the armco barriers held with just bo/fs, no nuts, and wire. And I touch one. I kick, and fall. (narrator) Fiffipa/di, now with McLaren, refused to even practice. The organizers of the Spanish Grand Prix fhreafened to impound a/I the cars in the grid if the defending champion did no! Drive. (Max Mos/e y) / thought, this is a world sport. I cannot believe that a world sport is run like this. (Max Mos/e y) So the drivers had a meeting in the Texaco motor home. (Fiffipa/di) We had to fight with the organizers. I mean really fight. (Nigel Roebuck) The track was sort of in the hills above Barcelona, and Friday afternoon, there was Silence. [birds chirping] [distant race engine revs] Then there was just one car, just one engine. [engine roars] Somebody said, "It's got to be lckx. " (narrator) While Jackie Ste war! Had stepped aside, the other Jacky was sti/I on the title hunt. Baby Face /ckx had taken Fiffipa/di's place af Lotus. (Jacky lckx) With the racing, frankly, you have to be individual/stro, in a way, and also selfish. (Max Mos/e y) The Pa v/o vian Reaction to the sound that they could hear, that was it. Then they a/I got in there and drove. [engine roaring] (Nigel Roebuck) If was a very, very fense afmosphere, extraordinarily tense atmosphere. The actual team mechanics were bo/fing these barriers together. (narrator) On race day, Fiffipa/di held frue to his word. (Emerson Fiffipa/di) / did one /ap and come in, as defending world champion. I went back to Geneva, and when I landed, Swiss TV waiting for me. I didn't know what happened in the Grand Prix. (narrator) The rear wing of Rolf Stemme/en 's Embassy Hi/I Lola broke off, sending the car info the barriers. (Nigel Roebuck) We're about 25 /aps info the race, and I can remember sa ying to the guys with me, "Jesus, that's Rolf. He's in the crowd." (narrator) Stemme/en survived, but four people were killed. [Emerson Fiffipa/di speaking French] (Max Mos/e y) Once drivers start worrying seriously about safety, you know that their fastest days are over. (Mos/e y) /f you took a/I the Formula One drivers, even the current crop of racing dri vers, "and said, " Here are two cars. That one is very safe. "That one 's exfreme/ y dangerous. "If you crash in if, you'll probably get killed. "But the dangerous one is two seconds a /ap quicker. ". There would be no discussion about which one fhey'd drive. They'd a/I get in the dangerous one. That's why it's the people running the sport have to take responsibility. (narrator) Just weeks after the failed strike in Spain, the most unlikely rivalry would spark along the Dutch coast at Zandvoorf. A battle between two drivers would help turn the tide in the re vo/ufion. (I ord Heskefh) Practice Friday, fantastic. Saturday, blue sky. Wake up Sunday morning, and suddenly it's piss/ng rain. Absolute pour/ng rain. (I ord Heskefh) E veryone else had their spanners out, wings are going up. "I look at the car, I say, "Look, we know "absolutely fuck-all about how you set a car up," "so we'd better leave it just the way it is." [engines roar] (I ord Heskefh) James does four laps, and he's in front of both Ferraris. (Koen Vergeer) When James Hunt approached, a/I the cro wds went to the fence. "Yeah, there he is again! There he is again!" (I ord Heskefh) You'd suddenly see white car, red car, (Vergeer) ...Niki Lauda in the Ferrari... Getting closer, getting closer. (Vergeer) "Yes! Keep him behind, keep him behind!" (I ord Heskefh) And then we won. (narrator) James Hunt held off Niki Lauda in his po werfu/ Ferrari, and gave Team Heskefh their first win after three years of trying. That's just brilliant. You know, the David and Goliath... fantastic story. (narrator) The playboy ga rag istes had pre va//ed over the most stor/ed team in Formula One. (I ord Hesketh) Party bas/call y started in the back of the truck. It's fair to say that eventually / went into blackout. If was special, 'cause the only guy who ever, ever took me seriously was the Commendafore. But then he was the only guy who counfed. (narrator) Mr. Ferrari was the most decorated man in motor racing. He 'a' famous/ y said, "Aerodynamics were for people who could not build engines. ". But he also hadn? Won a title since 1964, until Lauda. (Niki Lauda) You know, in Ita/y, there are a lot of emot/ons around the racing team. If you win, it's quite easy. If you lose, it's quite difficult. (John Watson) Niki was a ole ver guy. He was a good operafor. Probab/ y the ideal Ferrari driver. (Emerson Fiffipa/di) Niki's very technical, cool. James, even being English, he was very emot/anal. He 'a' come in my motor home before every race. "Emerson, can I use your toi/ef?" I'd say, "James, come on!" (narrator) With one epic win under his belt, Hunt left the fedd y bear behind for a chance at the title. He signed with the '74 world champion consfrucfor, McLaren. Those days, you got five years, with the death rate and everything else. He had a new future. (Jane Birbeck) The McLaren outfit was very sfrucfured. E verybody wore uniforms, but James just wore whatever he wanted. (narrator) While Lauda took the role of champion, leading the charge for safety in the drivers' union, Hunt became the new face of Formula One. (McNally) / don't know whether the drivers today go out and have a party till 3:00 in the morning and jump into the car. Who else could do that? (Freddie Hunt) / don't think you can get to that /e ve/ being, you know, just who you want to be. You have to be, to a certain extent, what... what a racing driver's supposed to be. You know, quick. (narrator) Hunt took po/e position in qualifying for the first two races in 1976, while Lauda took the checkered flags. I think they respected each other, but there was a need. Niki really wanted to be a cool guy, and he wasn? Quite a cool guy, and he used to wind James up whenever he had the opportunity. (man) What about this fellow James Hunt this weekend? Well, James Hunt won his Grand Prix in Holland, so I think he's a very, very strong competitor now. (Barnard) Niki would psych the other drivers out just by fa/king to them. I mean. (narrator) Hunfs first win came in Spain, but if was taken down when the wing on his car was judged too wide. I don't know how wide it is anyway, you know? I didn't even know there was a rule about it. I just drive the damn thing. (narrator) A2' Monaco, Lauda took the lead at the first turn, and ne ver looked back. If was his fourth win in six Starts. (Jody Scheckfer) He didn't seem spectacu/ar/ y fast, but he won races, and you could re/y that he's not going to do anything stupid. (narrator) Hunt stormed back in France, and after a dispufed start, took the checkered flag before a home crowd in Britain. (man) The Victory flag's cinched, and James Hunt crosses the line to win the British Grand Prix! James, fhey've changed the regu/afions concerning the wings, and yet you're still extremely fast. How do you do it? Big balls. Forget it. Can't you print that? We can't print... But it's true! (Icyx) The difference between drivers is maybe the quantity of desire you have to win races, because the falents are equal. That includes whatever the weather is when you're at the race course. Monza, Spa, Monaco, they were quite famous tracks. But one was reckoned as a symbol of pure driving. It's the highest possible challenge. JJ” (narrator) /n the shadow of German y's Eife/ mountains lies a monsfrous race track, 22 kilometers around. (Jacky lckx) 168 Corners. A2' the time, 17jumps. So you were flying 17 times at the Nürburgring. (Sir Jackie Ste warl) /f a car went off the road, you ne ver saw if. It just disappeared into the trees or the bushes, or down a ra vine. Hit/er built if in the Depression. If is the most challenging, the most re warding, the most dangerous, the greatest racefrack in the world. (Jacky lckx) To win at the Nürburgring, that means that's the race of your life. (narrator) /n 1976, the defending champion and points leader Niki Lauda cal/ed on his union to bo ycotf the Nürburgring, cifing unsafe track conditions. They cou/dn 'f marshal if. It would take an army of firefighters to do any good. [man over P.A., vintage audio] (narrator) Hunt cast his Vote to race. Lauda was defeafed by the s/immesf of marg/ns. One. (Brett Lunger) I came round the turn and he was sideways in the middle of the track. His car was on fire. (man) There's Brett Lunger getting out of the Surtees and info the flames. (I unger) The Ferrari had different be/ts and different systems. Art Merzario had driven a Ferrari. He was able to get in, undo the be/fs. I was on top of the car, and I grabbed Niki's shoulders and pulled him out of the car. (man) Lauda is finally dragged clear from the burning Inferno. The race of course is stopped. I remember him saying to me, "What's my face like? What's my face like?" In fact, he didn't know he'd ingested a lot of fax/c fumes from the burning resin and fiberglass of the bodywork of the car. People were already fa/king about him in the past fense. We were both certain that when we turned the radio on, we 'a' hear the morning news sa ying he was dead. (Lauda) / cou/dn? See anything. / was just listen/ny. Must have been in the hospital. My wife came into the room where I was lying, and, uh, she started crying, so... which didn't certainly help me. I told her afterwards, "Listen, why did you cry when... when you come in?" "Because I felt bad." She said, "Unfortunately", "I only recognized you on your feet." Because I was burned so bad, in my head and everywhere, that she had a shock. And that was the real issue at the time, so I thought, "Shit, I must fight now to stay alive." Five weeks later, I was back in the car in Monza. (Brett Lunger) Niki walked down the pit /ane to where my team was, and he said, "Brett, thank you." And then walked away. (Niki Lauda) / knew the risk / was getting myself info. The easy way back is to drive as quick as possible. Don 'f wait. As long as you wait, is more worried you get. [spectators cheering] He finished fourth and, you know, kept his world championship hopes alive. That's the most courageous thing I've ever seen. Lauda! Lauda! (Hunt) After a/I he's been through, I would like to see him right at the front, fighting and, you know, unblemished. (Maurice Hamilton) Back against the wall, James Hunt went out and he won these two races through just sheer deferminafion and grif, but there was something mag/cal about what Niki Lauda was doing. He was a very fough compefitor, but most people questioned his sanity. (Jane) That accidenf gave him charisma. (Jane Birbeck) They became... I hate to think what sort of buddies they became. Like playboys together, if you know what I mean. (man) Good afternoon, and welcome to the Japanese Grand Prix. This is the most exciting finish to a Grand Prix season in over len years. It's down to a fight for the championship between Hunt and Lauda, with Lauda just three points ahead. What an incredible end to the season! (John Hogan) They ended up going to the Japanese Grand Prix, and everybody wanted if, and the broadcasters of the world said, "Ah, that's good! Lez”s... /ef's..." "Oh! We don't have the rights!" "Oh! Now, how do we fix this?" [spectators cheering] (narrator) By 1976, Bernie Ecc/esfone and Max Mos/e y had become friends and parlners in the Formula One Consfrucfors ' associafion, the loose confederafion of garagisies, independent car builders. (Max Mos/e y) Bernie was complete/ y sfreefwise, an absolutely brilliant tactician. (Nigel Roebuck) Didn 'f fake Bernie that long to work out that the organizers were making a lot of money, and fundamentally the teams were getting screwed. (I ord Heskefh) Bernie came in. He said, "I have bought all of the world's." "TV rights for a mi///on dollars. ". There were len feams. "You can a/I have 10% for 3700, 000." (I ord Heskefh) Nine idiofs sa! There... "Think how much testing I could do with $100,000." I said, "No, thank you", and everyone else said "No, thank you," and that's how Bernie got control. Pathetic, really, but then that's how great fortunes are made! (narrator) While the Brabham owner would eventually sell his team, he has mainfained control of the sporfs Commercial rights ever since '76 and the Showdown in Japan. (John Hogan) Bernie said to the broadcaslers, "You can have the rights going forward," "but you've got to show every Grand Prix." (I ord Heskefh) As they say, the rest is history. (Niki Lauda) /n Fuji, if was raining a/I day long, that we could not drive. A2' four in the afternoon, the race director came "and said, " We have to start the race now because the television time." But I said, "Look, the rain is the same. " (Ecc/estone) Those early days, things were run a little bit more like a dictatorship rather than a democracy. It was me that said, "We're going to start, no matter what." (man) And the Japanese Grand Prix is underway! James Hunfs got a superb start. That's exactly what he wants to do, get in front of a/I those cars, because when you're in the front, you don't have that spray. When you're stuck behind in second, third, fourth, or where ver, you have this massive p/ume of spray in your face. It's Impossible to see anything. James Hunt in the lead, in the Marlboro McLaren. This is the start he needs. (Mario Andreffi) The visibility, especially at the beginning of the race, was no more than 20%, at best. (man) Look at that mist! How can they see anything driving in these conditions? (Scheckfer) 180 miles an hour, You're listen/ny, and then you're watching your side of the road, and if the car in front of you stops, you're going to be in trouble. (man) There's Jody Scheckfer, going down on the inside. Perhaps he fhinks there's belter grip down there on the inside. And there, Lauda, in the pils already, having a cockpit conference with Forghieri, the leader of the Ferrari team. What's happened to Lauda? Niki decided to stop. (man) And there is James Hunt for the lead, and Lauda seemingly out of the race already. He stopped. That was it. In the entire 40-odd years I've been involved, that's the only time I can remember a driver aclual/ y stopping because the conditions were so dangerous. Just incredible. (man) He 'S Spinning: [Jumbled remark] Out of the race completely, and out of the world championship! (Jody Scheckfer) If takes big ba//s to make a decision like that. Some people may think it's cowardly. Um, I think it's probably the opposite. (Watson) He went against all the things that being a Grand Prix driver at Ferrari are about. In other words, you drive for Ferrari, not yourself. And if you've got to die doing it, so be it. Die, but at least die trying. Ferrari were actually embarrassed for him. You know, "No, the car is, the engine is finished," and all the rest of it. Lauda actually got angry when he heard them doing that and fold if straight. (Koen Vergeer) He was the one who res/sted the myfh of Ferrari. And he said no, no. Who said that before to Enzo Ferrari? To these days, I think / would ne ver forgive Niki Lauda. That particular moment, he thought it was too dangerous for him, and he forget the 50, 60 people from Ferrari he/ping him to achie ve. The thousands of people in the whole of Italy... he forgot a/I of those people in that time, and their beloved Lauda, he become selfish and he said, "No, I don't want to drive. " (Niki Lauda) I don 'f regref if. But I already saw what can happen. (man) And so we've got about four /aps to go, and James Hunt is sti/I second. (Hamilton) The championship wasn? Seff/ed there and then when he stepped out of the car because James had to finish third or higher. (man) James Hunfs in the pils with one ba/d fire and the other is flat. But there is Mario Andreffi, in the lead. Now, where does that lea ve Hunt as he exits the pits? Is Hunt sti/I in the top two Hunt? James Hunt, racing for his life. I think Hunt is currenf/ y fourth. And there's Hunt, going past Alan Jones. That will put him info third place, and info the world champion title! Will his car hold together? James Hunt... and Mario Andreffi takes the flag, and here comes Hunt! James Hunt has done if! Hunt is the champion! When he got out of the car, James didn't know if he'd won the Championship. He thought he'd finished fourth. [vintage audio] Hunt was world champion in the end, by one point. Dramafic Formula One folklore. /z”// be there fore ver. (Freddie Hunt) When I met Niki, the first thing he said to me was, "I /o ved your father. ". And, I mean, I think Dad quiz' at the end of the season. He wished he could have shared the championship with Niki. They both lived to win, and he wanted to share it with him. But he couldn't, obviously. There can be only one. That was his shoot/ng star moment, I think, and if was the seminal changing point in Formula One. (narrator) The fairytale end/ng belonged to Hunt, but if was Lauda's decision to quiz' with the championship on the line that helped change the sport fore ver. /f the fastesz' drivers refuse to race out of fear for their lives with the entire world watching, there is no Formula One. (Watson) We understood that culling racing drivers is not a good deal. The public doesn't want to see these heroes dying on television, dying in your living room. (man) This week's big event is the British Grand Prix. Really, safety came about with money. (John Hogan) And that was a/I to do with the television. That was the real breakthrough. That's no! Really frue. The money helped, but the whole point about safety is it depends on the attitude of the people running the sport. (narrator) The new men taking the lead in the fight were Survivors in their own right. /t was obvious that something needed to be done. A decade after Jim Clark's death shocked the world, Bernie Ecc/esfone quief/ y hired the leading neurosurgeon in London as the official race doctor for Formula One. This was Bernie's idea, to take on this permanent doctor, Professor Sid Wafkins, a renowned brain surgeon. (Dr. Sid Wafk/ns) The first year with Bernie was a very difficult year because nobody wanted Sid Watkins at the circuit. (Jody Scheckfer) The y've got their own doctors, and they don 'f like some Englishman coming along and saying, you know, "We want to do this." (narrator) A2' the German Grand Prix in 1978, Dr. Wafk/ns' fourth race, the organizers banned the track doctor from race control just moments before the start. Bernie says, "Well, pack the cars. We 're lea Ving. ". Race control rep/led, "What am I going to do" "with 80,000 Germans who are here?" And Bernie said, "You can go and tell them to fuck themselves." And they said, "The doctor can come back in. " (narrator) If was always said that Sid Watk/ns was the only man to whom Bernie Ecc/esfone always deferred. (narrator) Four races later, Dr. Watk/ns learned firsthand the hardest lesson in Formula One. [announcer speaking German] [specfafors reacting] [announcer confinues speaking] (Jane Birbeck) We wafched if on TV. James pulled Ronnie out of the car. I was pre vented from getting there by the police, for about 20 minutes or so. I mean, if was abso/uie ma yhem. (narrator) The super Swede, Ronnie Peterson, had both of his legs crushed in the pileup. E venfually, Ronnie went off in the he/icopfer, and we resumed the start. (narrator) Colin Chapman won his se venfh and final world championship with Mario Andreffi. He also lost his fifth driver. Peterson died the next day, after suffering an embolism. That was just a sword through my heart. He should no! Have died from that. /f Dr. Watk/ns was in charge at Monza, Ronnie Peterson would probably be sitting next to me. (Koen Vergeer) Peterson was one of the guys on my first race. AI/ the others disappeared. They had stopped, or they had died. On that day, when Ronnie Peterson died, my childhood approach to Formula One ended. If was a turning point for the sport, too. (narrator) From that race on, Dr. Watk/ns began riding in a safety car behind every start, for the most dangerous /ap of every race, so he could be on hand in the event of an accident. My job was really to look after the drivers, and that's what I did. (narrator) He sfandardized medical response within Formula One, mandafing permanent medical facilities af each circuiz' and he/icopfers on hand for every race and practice. Sid Watk/ns was the man. Formula One sti/I lost four men in four years. (man) An outstand/ng driver lost his //fe through what was, in my opinion, a pure motor racing accident. (narrator) But only two drivers were killed over the next 12 years. Each death was me! With scrutin y by the men in charge, And a haunf/ng refrain by those who knew too well the price of g/ory. It's ferrib/y, ferrib/y sad, but it's always happened and it always will. It's just intrinsic to Formula One. (narrator) Uni/I one. (Martin Brund/e) I was driving in the race, and if was a really strange time. We hadjusf lost Roland Rafzenberger a day earlier. And everybody Starts looking over their shoulder and looking round at what's going to happen next. (Jo Ramirez) And I remember that evening that we were ta/king about, yep, if was Rafzenberger. If was, like, his first race. No! For one minute / thought if could ever happen to Senna. (narrator) The three-time world champion had become the new face of Formula One, the one driver who could fina/I y challenge the great Fangio. (Eddie Jordan) You had this great vision of a megastar in A yrton Senna. He was re vered. He was probably the most popular world champion because he had everything, and he brought great style to Formula One. He brought it to another level. (Dr. Walk/ne) He was one of the most geni/e people that you could imagine. He was getting older, and he was starting to campaign hea vi/y for safety. You've seen Rubens? He's all right. He's all right. He's shocked, of course, but he's all right. (Dr. Sid Wafkins) On Sunday morning, just before the race, I said to A yrton, "You know, you're the fastesz' guy around." "Why don't you quit?" He said, "/ can 'f quif. I have to go on. ". Maybe I should have been much more se vere with him. But then, you know, you've got responsibi/ifies to a/I of those... all of those boys. And they were boys to me, see, since I was so much older than them. (Lewis Hamilton) I was 9 years old, and my dad fold me that A yrton 's crashed and he's died. I think as a kid at that age, it's always difficult to understand what that actually means. But I went round the back of the car, I remember, and I cried. I cou/dn 'f let my dad see me because, you know, you don 'f let a man see you cry, But I remember that day, and I really was affected by it. Sti/I today, I say he's the greatest driver ever. (Maurice Hamilton) The biggest difference between the death of Jim Clark on the 7th of April, 1968, and A yrton Senna on the 132' of May, 1994, is that the world needed to know the answer as to wh y this had happened. Why is this man dead? Why is motor racing so dangerous? The death of A yrton Senna was relayed by television info the living rooms of millions of people around the world, to people who didn't really know about motor sport, but knew of him. Somebody had to be blamed. (narrator) The new president of the FIA had been on the grid the day Jim Clark died. I think it's distressing that so much of the press doesn 'f appreciate the rea/ifies of the situation. (narrator) Max Mos/e y had ascended to the ultimate position of power within the sport just months before Senna's death. (Mos/e y) They were absolutely concenfraied on, wh y did Senna have the crash? Tofal/ y irre/e van f. It's a sport done at the limit of human and mechanical ability. When you do that, you're going to have a crash. The interesting question isn't wh y he crashed, it's why did he get killed? (narrator) Mos/e y cal/ed on Dr. Watk/ns to lead a scientific examination info every aspect of the sport. (Schumacher) Max had a clear message, sa ying that whatever is happening to a car, there should be no reason to die in a car. [spectators cheering] (Martin Brund/e) / remember going up in the air. My first thought was, "Please don 'f let me go in the frees, " because, you fly, you die, info the frees. Then if Starts to roll. If fee/s like being in a tumble dryer, a washing machine. When if stopped, I could feel this liquid running down info my overalls. I could smell fuel, and I thought I was going to catch fire and burn. (man) This is what we feared at this corner, and that was very nasty indeed! (Damon Hill) That's the first big accidenf since A yrton Senna, and the whole world was watching. (Brund/e) If was the first race where fhey'd raised the headresfs, up beside the driver, and that played a big role in me no! Being injured at all. No! Only was he alive, but he got back in the race. [spectators cheering] And it struck me then that we 'a' moved on, that the whole aspect of it had changed. (Mos/e y) What happened was the affifude changed, and Senna gave the impetus to really go info safety on a scientific basis. (narrator) In an arms race for speed, no expense has been spared for survival. (Lewis Hamilton) Never had that fear. Never been worried about death or the danger of getting hurt. (Sebastian Vellel) 270 kilometers an hour through the Corners. Ah, it's unbelievable. Sometimes if you just look outside, left and right, you think, am I crazy? It's almost like you have control of the danger. (Bern/e Ecc/estone) There 's probably as many accidenfs today as there was then... but the results of the accidenfs are complete/ y different. [remarks from race announcer] (ma/e reporter) Have you seen the accidenf on TV? Well, yeah, I... l have seen it also live, when I was there! But, uh... [onlookers laughing] (Sir Jackie Ste warl) The modern-da y driver will ne ver know, and I hope and pray that they ne ver find out what if fee/s like to have the consistency of death surrounding you. (Jacky lckx) The idea was no! To race and die, the idea was to race and to last as long as possible. After a/I I have said about Jackie Ste wart, I really did appreciate what he started. (Nigel Manse/I) Emerson and I have been fa/king about if today, actually. We're very grateful to be alive, to have actually won the races we've won and driven. (Jacky lckx) / think we all did something unbe/ie vab/e, at the abso/uie lim/f of the job. In our days, we knew if you made a misfake or something broke, you had a good chance you wou/dn 'f get out of if. (Emerson Fiffipa/di) AI/ these drivers, they had a glamorous life, and they were incredible. I love my sport, and if was awarding to be with my friends. (Andreffi) I'm knock/ng on wood every day that I was one of the lucky ones that really dodged the bullets. (Mos/e y) /n the end, we were able to use a/I these de ve/opmenfs to /ifera/I y re vo/utionize the crash safety of the ordinary car industry. (Mansa/I) That's why it's such a fantastic sport. If pioneers the evolution of the car, and going faster. But safefy's got to come first. Three thousand people get killed every day on the roads worldwide. To make a one per cent difference, even one per cent, is 30 people a day. Real/y, that alone justifies everything that's come from Formula One. But, you see, one's always haunled by the past. Max be/ie ves everyone should //ve to a hundred. I don 'f look back, aclual/ y. I look forward. Yesferda y's yesterday. (man) Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! We are world champions! World champions! (man) Oh, no! Mark Webber's gone right up there! Oh! Mark Webber's gone completely over the top there. (male vocalist) .U A/I this fee/s strange and unfrue .U .U Ana' I won 'f waste a minute .U
