A DOG'S DEATH WE'RE GONNA MISS YOU. The Left always had this childish idea that poverty causes crime. The country's economy has only grown over the last decade, but crime has raised. Crime recidivism is around 60%, as prisons do not rehabilitate. 600 people are sent to prison each year, almost 2 per day. 40% of them are below 25 years of age. From the year 2006 until now, imprisonment has grown... Hello? Okay. Who was it? Nobody. A beggar. Don't give them anything. Or we'll never get rid of them. Okay. Carry on. I'm here if you need anything. -Can you make the ligature? -Yes. Could you hand me the tape? Don't move, honey. How old is she? Four or 5, not sure, she lived on the street. -You got her? -Yes. -Weight? -12 kilos. Sorry. -Take that call. -Thanks. Alright Cuki. Good girl. Stay still. Come here. Everything okay? Yes. I'm sorry. I'll get her ready. What a relief. I thought they had gotten stolen. Imagine, changing locks and all... Sorry to interrupt, Mario. -What is it? -Cuki died. How can she die? I'm sorry. These epileptic reactions are unpredictable. It's difficult for us... ...to predict them. They don't show in the studies. We can never really... Would you like a glass of water? We work with a service... for cremation. Then the ashes you just... -I don't know... -That's what people choose. We take care of everything. You just... Sign here. Guadalupe left for Verónica's house. I called her but got no answer. They're not here, I checked everywhere. Every time she comes things disappear. And how are you? Kisses. It hurts to see a big Uruguayan football team, a big team in South America and the world play so poorly. They were unable to win a game they had under control at the start of the second half. They had chances to score, but Gutiérrez as a striker... He can play the local tournament, but for international matches he's... How could I put it? A bit heavy, lacking rhythm... slow in his performance. This team from Argentina is far from marvelous. It's an average team in its league. They could have perhaps won this game, not an easy victory... But they could have tied it at least. This is stuck, doc. Wanna try yourself? We can just stick it in with the bag and all. Our team is losing again. Right doc? We're playing so bad. Total lack of strategy. We need Gutierrez to run. He can't run. He lost his stamina five years ago. Will you want an urn? Their goalie hasn't seen any action, they haven't shot on goal. Not once. Hi, sorry to come this late. It's done already? What is it? -This is Alicia. -Why did you cremate her so fast? That's how it's usually done. It takes a while. A vet friend of mine told me it's very odd that a dog dies of an epileptic seizure. That's what the studies showed. I can give you the clinical history. We wanted to do an autopsy. There is no autopsy for dogs. -We just... -Now we can't do the autopsy. You cremated him in a hurry. Nobody cremated nobody in a hurry here. -She signed an authorization. -You signed an authorization? Who owns the dog? I'm gonna talk to some people, and see what they say. Good. If you have doubts, get an opinion. Have them talk to me if necessary. I just came to give you this. Careful, it's fragile. Good night. This lame fuck is lying. Uruguayan teams always had strong, tough defenders. But here their striker easily eluded a midfielder... Where were the defenders? Their forward got in and did whatever he liked while nobody helped defend. But again, even if you do defend and don't let them score, if you don't hurt the opponent not even once, because their defense blocks all your shots all those weak out swingers... That may work locally but not at an international level. That won't get you any titles... When can you take time off? I don't know. They have specials, the Caribbean, Europe. But we need to know when you can take time off. I told you, I don't know yet. Well, try to figure it out. All good today? Yes, all good. -You okay? -Yeah. -What was that? -I don't know. -Did you see anybody? -No. Let's go inside. Let's go. New police reports show a growing female presence leading organized crime groups related to narco-trafficking. We're discussing today the role of women in narco-trafficking organizations. Welcome Gabriel. The history of women in narco-trafficking is as old as the business itself. There's the case of Griselda Blanco, for instance, the so called Cocaine Godmother... She created the system of routes. She gave Pablo Escobar the first routes so that he could grow and become a big narco trafficker. Yes? Hello. Have anything to give away? No. We don't have anything. Sorry. Bread, clothes, anything. The lady of the house is not here. And you, won't you give me nothing? How was your day? It was good. Yours? Good, quiet. Hello? Veronica, it's us. Get the car in the garage. It's OK. We'll leave it here. As you wish. Come in. We'll pay for one of them. After 40 years of work, let us give you a present. Right, Dad? I'll put that in the fridge. -Don't get him excited. -It's okay. Guadalupe, put this in the fridge. Did you get the travel specials I sent? Yeah, your mother told me, but the dates are limited. You travel when they want. Is that a problem for you now? Well, it still is for me. Excuse me. Those specials are tickets nobody wants. What? No! Nice little puppy! -Do you need help? -No, don't worry. You just sit, watch TV if you like. No, no teeth. Don't eat my hand. Leave your cellphone, Felipe. Come help me. Mom, are you still there? Do you need anything? Just one. OK? Stay still. -Easy on the mayo. -It's dry. Too much. What's this, Dad? What is it? Mario. A woman on Facebook says they killed her dog at Dad's clinic. No, it's nothing. What? She makes all these claims. What happened, Mario? The dog had an epileptic seizure and died. It's nothing. Lots of comments here. Insults. Excuse me. Should I take the dishes? Thanks, Guadalupe. Coffee? It's a bit late for us. -Don't you think? -We have the ice cream you brought. They could come to our place for dinner for a change. You didn't tell me a dog died on you. What do we do? Stay here, I'll go in. -Aw, they took the TV. -Shh... What a mess! -Hey! -What are you doing? Give me that. -Wait. -Let go. The chocolate too. This country has become unlivable. It was our mistake. The side door was unlocked. I told you. You need to move to an apartment. That house... I'll give you a set of keys. So you can come and go. Thanks, it's not necessary. Thank you. Do you lock the side door? In general, do you check that it's locked? I always lock it. Thanks Lupe. We're preparing the room downstairs. So you have privacy. As you wish, it's not necessary for us. Is everything ready? I just have to bring the blankets. I'll get them. You go to sleep. Thank you. Come, Mom. It's nice. It was a mess, but we tidied it up a bit. Come, I'll give you a blanket. Let's go. Make yourselves at home. If you want to watch TV, go upstairs. Anything... Thank you. That's the pool pump. I'll show you how to turn it off. This one shuts off everything. The large blankets are getting washed, but we have Feli's. I hope you don't mind. How do you watch these cameras? With an app on my phone. I'll show you later. We always check everything. They must have had a key. How did they know where the alarm was? I don't know. Thieves know those things. The way that beggar talked to me was very strange. She thought it was her she was talking to. They all talk like that. Don't worry about it. These people say yes to everything, but you never know what they're thinking. What people? Let's go. What are you doing? Let's go. Wait. Come watch this. Go away Axel! Why don't you stop all this? Don't you see it? You need to calm down. You just don't dare to ask. I don't dare to ask whom? Look, nothing happens. She must have heard you. Let's go home, we need to start tidying up. I'll stay here. I'm tired. Good. Have you lost something? No. Hello. Guadalupe? Hello? Guadalupe? Guadalupe told me she gave you the keys. Is that true? The house keys. Who is this? Did she? -What happened to her? -Nothing. She can't talk now. Who are you? Why did you take Guadalupe's phone? -No... -I need to talk to her. Why doesn't she have her phone? Who's this? Everything okay? There are no stains on the bed sheets, only in the quilt. We're trashing the sheets anyway. Okay. Go! Go! All good out there? Hello. What happened? Stop animal abuse! Stay here. You criminal motherfucker! Is she working illegally? Hey sister! Stand up for your rights! We know where you live, you fucking murderer! We're coming for you! Let go of her! Have they done anything to you? Son of a bitch! Yes, I'll take care of it. We'll talk later. Yes. Oh, perfect. I hadn't gotten that last part. Yes, they're here. No, they're fine. Okay. Let's do that. I'll look for your call. Thanks for everything Cesar. Say hi to Adriana. Ciao. Okay. Cesar says he'll file a libel complaint tomorrow. We can claim lost profit as the clinic is closed. You're losing money. Should he go ahead? Yes. One of them said they know where we live. How can they know? I don't know. Maybe they broke into our house. Do we have any evidence? Did you say anything to them? I tried to, but they wouldn't hear it. What do you want me to do? They're playing smart. Nobody teaches them a lesson. Eat up, Felipe. Excuse me. Did you happen to see my cell phone? I'll call you. -Don't bother. -It's no bother. Do you hear anything? Maybe it's in one of the bedrooms and we can't hear it. Can we finish our dinner? Yes, don't bother. Really. Check in those drawers. Behind the computer? Behind the desk? Move it... Let's see in Feli's bedroom. Oh, voicemail. I'll call again. Let's look in Feli's room. Look behind the bed. And behind those toys? By that ball? It's not here. Did you look properly? Let me call. Don't bother. Yes, I looked properly. Can we finish dinner? Yes, please. Is something the matter? What is it? We could have made a little harder effort in finding Guadalupe's phone. She loses everything. She'll find it. Eat up, Felipe. I'm not hungry. -Listen to your mother. -Eat your food. Let him be. He's not hungry. Good. Don't tell me you're hungry later. I'm off to bed. Report them to the Board of Veterinary and expose them publicly. Your dog can't talk anymore, but we can stop these bastards. What an s.o.b. I'm sick and tired of saying this. I don't know if you feel the same way, but hearing the coach say that they received the goal at the team's best moment... They played a horrible game. What best moment is he talking about? He says the goal was unexpected, but it really was only a matter of time. Sometimes you agree with the coach's reading of a game, but I don't know what he saw here. The team had no determination whatsoever... Come here Axel! Come here! What happened? I don't know. We must call the police. Yes? It's not your fault. Who told him to sneak in here? This place is full of cameras. Do you have your cellphone with you? You can't see anything there. There's nothing there. Really, there's nothing. We can't be together anymore. I love another woman. Don't call me. What are you doing? We take him home and then we see. He won't fit there. Go check if someone's coming. Good morning. Axel. Axel. Axel, come here. Let's have breakfast. Everybody's up. You need to change. Cesar just wrote to me. He filed the complaint. Now we just wait. His colleagues say these people don't have a case. -Everything okay? -Yes. I was going to clean the room downstairs now. If that's OK. No, we're gonna use it now. As you prefer. Yes, I prefer that. Well, let me know if you need anything. Can you wait here so she cleans downstairs? It'll take a minute. Dad? Guadalupe's been helpful since you came, you could show some consideration. I'm talking to you! -Can we eat in peace? -I'm talking to Dad. I know it's a rough time for you, but you can't come here and treat people like that. You need to respect how we treat people here. What? I can't help you if you don't tell me what's wrong. Tell me what's happening. It will be good for you to talk. Vero. -Vero! -Not now. Everything OK? Yes, just go away. -Talk to your father. -I can't now, Juan. -Should I do it? -No. You can't stay angry at each other. Come here. Get in. What a pity! So young. Poor little thing. You go now, we'll take him. But it must be heavy. I'll help you. No, you just go. I got it. What was its name? Axel. -Do we put it on the table? -No, just open. It goes with the bag and everything. I'm sorry. Just a second. Subtitling: FAST TITLES MEDIA
