"Our story takes place in Southern California." "The problem with which it deals .." "Belongs not to any one city, town or country." "But is of our times." Mrs Hunter. - Yes? Long distance. Mr Hunter on the phone. - Thank you, Martha. Martha, the things are in the back seat. Yes, ma'am. Hello darling. How are you? "Wonderful. And you?" Fine. How did everything go? "Better than I expected." Oh, I'm so glad. "I'm flying home tonight." You are? Why, that's wonderful. I wasn't expecting you until next week. What time does the plane get in? - "Much too early for you to get up." Oh no, I'll meet you. I want people to see my husband abuses me. "At six-thirty?" But I don't mind. I've been up at six-thirty before. Besides, it will give me a good excuse to leave the party early. "Party, tonight?" Yeah, Paula is throwing a shindig. "That nitwit." Why honey, she's your cousin, not mine. "So watch yourself." Aright, I'll see you in the morning. Oh, Bob. Don't eat anything on the plane. We'll have breakfast together. "Okay." - Bye. "Chris, darling." - Hmm? "I'll be counting on the minutes." Well, that's nice to know. "I've really missed you." - Bye. Martha, we'll have an early breakfast tomorrow. Mr Hunter is flying home. Wonderful. Tell Agnes to be sure to have lots of waffles and bacon and coffee. And just loads of that blackberry jam. Why don't get so excited. He's only been gone a week. It's been ten days. - What difference does three days make? Martha, you will never know. I laid out your things for the party. - Thanks. Good evening, Mr Hannaford. - Good evening, George. How is the party upstairs? Still going strong? If an atom bomb went off they wouldn't even hear the explosion. Well, don't take it too far away. I won't be long. Okay, sir. They need them like they need a hole in the head. Nourishment, anybody? Larry. - Chris. What are you doing here? - Practising being a hostess. Drink? - No thanks. How did you crash the charmed circle? I didn't know you and Paula were so friendly. Believe it or not, Paula invited me. Bob still out of town? - Yes, but he's flying home tonight. I'll bet it's been a long week. - Too long. Mr Hannaford. About time you got here. A fine thing, trying to give a party without the guest of honor. Sorry, Paula. I've been so busy. I have to work so hard in the morning. More divorces? What is American marriage coming to? - You should know. Oh my, how acid we are tonight. Come on. Have a drink. That'll sweeten you up. No thanks. I just came to make my excuse. Oh, you're not going to get off that easily my boy. Listen, everybody. Quiet, please. The time has come to tell you why I gave this party. Come in closer. Six years ago I committed a crime against society. I married a man. Well, imagine. Anyway, I've taken my punishment and today I was pardoned. For the parole. - Divorce. Don't be crude. Now I want to pay a tribute to the man who made all this possible. Larry Hannaford. Larry, take a bow. Am I embarrassing you? - You are. I'm so glad. Besides, I only do the paperwork. The rest I leave to the ladies. Don't you believe it. This morning he stood up in court and made a speech that belongs to history. In twenty minutes I was a free woman. I am now again on the open market. Do I hear any bidders? My hair is my own. My teeth are my own. Practically everything is my own. Speak up, gentlemen. Go on. Tell them. Tell them all about it. Tell them how wonderful you are. And then I'll tell them a few things. Well, the corpse of the post-mortem. What's the matter? Did I forget something when I packed your things? What do you want? I want to sock you right in the jaw. Roger, you shouldn't have come here. Neither should you. I didn't expect you dance on my grave. I thought you were a friend of mine. I am. Come on, I want to talk to you. Well, why is everyone standing around? I've got news for you. The party goes on. Put your eyes back in, Claire. This is private. Good old Chris, my favorite in-law. We both married the same family only I got the sour apple. You're not in the family now, junior. So take a walk. This isn't your home anymore. It never was a home. You wouldn't know what a home is. Well, I know what a scandal is. - Paula, please. You only make it worse. Don't bother, Chris. I'm through letting her ride me. I've got a few things to tell her assembled friends. Roger, it won't do any good. Listen, dear ex-mistake. It took me six years to make up my mind to leave you. Now you get out of here or I call the police. Paula, stop. Can't you see he's sick. Sick, my hat. He's fractured. At least give him a chance. - Taking sides, Chris? I'm trying not to. I know how to handle him. - Lower your voices. Come on, Roger. I'll take him home. Thanks. I'll get by. You helped me enough in court. It wasn't Larry's fault. Come on. - Get some fresh air. Fresh air? This whole place ought to be fumigated. Stay away from that crowd, Chris. You don't belong with them. They're no good. They got no respect for anything. Decency, marriage, anything. He has a point there. - You stick with Bob. You got the right idea. Bob is a swell guy. You know where he lives, Larry. I ought to. I've sent him enough legal documents. I know. This is part of my work. I'm very proud of it. Come on, Roger. Goodnight, Chris. Say hello to Bob for me. Goodnight, Larry. I will. "TWA flight 36." "Leaving concourse number 14." "Gate 12." "TWA flight 36." "Leaving concourse number 14." "Gate 12." "Passenger Harold McCord." "Please report to TWA ticket office." "Passenger Thelma Benson." "Please report to TWA ticket office." "Passenger Gerald Alexander." "Please report to TWA ticket office." Get me that bag please. Right on top. - Yes, sir. How about a statement, Mr Hunter? What do you know of this? I'm sorry .. Mr Hunter. - Agnes. What's the matter? What's going on here? - I don't know how to tell you. Where is Mrs Hunter? Is she alright? Never in my whole life .. - Come on, tell me, is she alright? She's alright, Mr Hunter. She is upstairs. Your friend Mr Hannaford is with her. - Oh. We spoke on the phone. Reynolds. Detective Lieutenant. Homicide Division. Homicide? You said there had been an accident. What is all this? - Well, I wish I knew. Maybe you can help us out? Take a look in here. Hey, Lieutenant. Can we come in now? In a few minutes, boys. Know him? No. Who is he? How did he die? Well, from what we've learned so far, it looks like your wife killed him. That's impossible. Why should she? That's what we're trying to find out. Ever see this before? Yes, it's a souvenir I sent home from Japan. Well, that's what did it. Your maid here says she heard a scream in the middle of the night. Came running down the stairs. She and the other maid .. Saw this fellow laid down and Mrs Hunter leaning against the wall holding this. That's right, Mr Hunter. It was just horrible. Her dress was all torn and her hands were .. Covered with blood. Just horrible. Never in my whole life .. Didn't she say anything? Did she say what happened? No, sir. No sir. We turned on the lights and she just fainted dead away. Then we carried her upstairs and called the doctor. It seems they also called Mr Hannaford. When he got here, he called us. And between him and the doctor we have not been able to get a statement yet. We didn't know what to do. She was all broken up. The doctor had to give her a sedative. Reynolds, I'll talk to you later. I must go and talk to my wife. Oh Mr Hunter, I'm so glad you're home. Me and Martha, have been half crazy what with all their questions. Larry. - Bob. Chris. Chris, darling. Bob? Is it really you? - Yes darling, it's me. I thought you'd never get here. - There, there. Oh Bob, I'm so afraid. You have nothing to be afraid of, darling. I'm here now. I'll take care of you. Hold me tight. Hold me very tight. It's alright. - Bob. It's alright, darling. Well, how is she? She'll be alright now that her husband is back. Did you get a chance to speak to her? I didn't get the details but she'll give you her story. No. No, thank you. He seems like a nice fellow. Bob? They don't come any better. An old friend of yours? Went to school together. Stanford. How long was he overseas? A little over two years, I think. - Uhuh. Were they married then? Yes. Just before he shipped out. How long has he been back? Ten or eleven months. And they get along pretty well, you'd say? No. I should say very well. Very well indeed. If I were being questioned Lieutenant, I would add that you'll go a long way .. Before you meet a couple as happy as these two. No, I wasn't trying to question you, Mr Hannaford. Just making conversation. Naturally. By the way, what is his business? The building business. He builds houses for people to live in. That's why he went up to Oregon, to make arrangements to build more houses. Better houses. Is she better, Martha? - Much. I wonder if she's ready to talk to us yet. I'll see. Come in. Come on in, Larry. Do you feel like talking to the police now, Chris? The police? Yes. They would like to get a statement. Well .. Can't they wait, and give her a chance to get dressed? They've been waiting a long time, Bob. After all, a man has been killed. She didn't do it deliberately. She certainly had a good reason. I'm sure of it. But that is what they want to find out. It happened, didn't it. I was trying to think it hadn't. Look, Larry. She's in no condition to make a long statement right now. She'll have to do it sooner or later, Bob. Take my advice, Chris. Do it now. What about it, darling? Alright. If you think I should. Don't mind me, Larry. I'm sure you know what you're doing. Thanks for taking over. I'll do whatever I can to help. Well I guess he might as well come in now. Yep. Alright, Lieutenant. Won't you sit down, Lieutenant? Thanks. Mrs Hunter will be out in a minute. This must be the dress she was wearing. Lieutenant. She's had a bad shock. I hope .. Don't worry, Mr Hunter. This won't be a third degree. I just want to get the facts. Chris, this is Lieutenant Reynolds. How do you do, Mrs Hunter. I'm sorry to bother you like this, but .. Well, we have a job to do. I'm sure you understand. Yes, of course. Sit over here, Chris. I won't trouble you with any more questions than I have to. Now suppose you tell me .. Just exactly what happened from the time you got home last night. Well. It .. isn't very clear. As well as you can remember it. Take your time, Chris. Well. I got home about one-thirty or two, I'd say. Put the car in the garage and came around to the front entrance. Did you notice anyone as you drove in? - No, I didn't. He must have been hiding behind a tree or in the shrubbery. Anyway, when I opened the door I heard a noise. I turned and he was standing there. Is that when you screamed? - No. Why not? Weren't you frightened? Yes, but I .. I didn't have time. He put his hand over my mouth and shoved me inside. Go on. Well he .. he closed the door. He warned me not to make any trouble. - He threatened you? Yes. - With a gun? No. Did you find a gun? No, just checking. Go ahead, Mrs Hunter. What happened then? He asked me for my jewellery. Your jewellery? - Yes. I suppose I should have given it to him but .. He kept staring at my engagement ring. I didn't want to give that up. Surprising. Trying to pull a job like that without a gun. What's surprising about it? A lot of them work that way. Especially the smart ones. If they're caught the punishment is usually less severe. This is more like a hold-up than a burglary, Hannaford. A man wouldn't try a job like that without .. some kind of a weapon. Say, this fellow must have known that Mr Hunter was away. Why do you say that? He wouldn't have tried it if there had been a man in the house. He must have been watching the place for quite some time. Had you ever seen him before, Mrs Hunter? No. Are you sure? - Yes. Hanging around outside, maybe? - No. Try to remember, Mrs Hunter. It's very important. No, no. I had never seen him before. All I know is he's dead. He's dead and I killed him. - Chris, don't. Don't blame yourself, darling. It wasn't your fault. Look Reynolds. You asked her to say what happened. Why don't you give her a chance? I'm sorry, Mr Hunter. I'm simply trying to get things straight. Now Chris, get a hold of yourself. You've done very well up to now. I'm sorry. Good. Now you say he asked for your jewellery. What happened after that? I didn't know what to do. I thought if I could get upstairs. Wake the servants. I tried to make a run for it, but .. He was too quick for me. He caught me. Pulled me back. I stumbled and almost fell into the living room. Go ahead. He was furious. He came after me. I screamed. And he grabbed me again. I tried to fight him but .. We hit against something. The lamp was knocked over. Suddenly I was at the desk. And my hand touched the knife. Then I .. I didn't mean to kill him. I didn't want to. But I thought he was going to kill me. I had to do it. I had to do it. Chris, darling. Darling, don't. It was the only thing you could do. You showed a lot of courage, Chris. I know it's a terrible thing. I know how you feel, darling. There, Chris. Take it easy. - Well .. there you have it. A case of justifiable homicide. Wouldn't you say, Lieutenant? You're the legal expert, Mr Hannaford. It must have been quite a struggle. Any idea who he was? No. Just a name so far. Tanner. Michael Tanner. It may be his own, maybe not. We found a couple of bills addressed to him. 1-4-7-2-5 Laurel Canyon. I've put a man on it. Well. I am .. I am sorry we had to put you through all this, Mrs Hunter. There is just one more thing. I'd like a written statement. If you folks could come down to my office around noon, say? Homicide Bureau. City Hall. Certainly. We should have some information by then. [ Police siren ] What's that? It's probably the ambulance from the coroner's office. He's still in the house? Don't worry, Mrs Hunter. We'll have the body removed at once. By the way, hold on to the dress. Don't have it cleaned. We may need it later. Thanks again. - Thank you, Lieutenant. Larry. You will come down-town with us, won't you? Of course. - Why don't you stay for breakfast? I'll be around. I'd better join the reporters. Chris. Chris, what is it? What's the matter? Are you alright? Maybe you'd better get back in bed. - No. No, I'll be alright. Your hands are so cold. Here. Chris, try not to think about it. It's over now. Forget it. It's not much of a homecoming for you, is it? Not the kind I'd planned. You were so happy yesterday when you phoned. I'm still happy. Why shouldn't I be? Sure, this has happened, but you're alright. That's all I care about. Suppose my plane had cracked up and I'd have been lucky enough not to be hurt. We'd be shocked and scared like we are now, but .. We wouldn't let it bother us too long, would we? Darling. What if this had turned out the other way? What if you had been killed? When I called from the airport and they said there had been an accident .. I could only think of one thing. That something had happened to you. I was sick. All hollow inside. Chris. You're alive. You're safe. That's all that matters. Morning paper. Paper, lady? Morning Examiner. God. Michael. Hello, Morrie. - Hello, Mr Hannaford. We're here to see Lieutenant Reynolds. Mr and Mrs Hunter. Why don't you sit down. I'll tell him you're here. Thanks. Yes? "Mr Hannaford is here." "With Mr and Mrs Hunter." Alright. I'll see them in a few minutes. Well, Mrs Tanner. You .. You say you work at Miller's Department Store. Is that right? Yes. And you live at ..? 184 North Terra Road. When did you move from Laurel Canyon? Laurel Canyon? We never lived in Laurel Canyon. There must be some mistake. Has Taylor come in yet? - "No he hasn't Lieutenant." I want to see him as soon as he gets here. Now your husband. What .. What did he do for a living? He was an artist. A sculptor. - A sculptor, huh? You mean statues, that sort of thing? How did he make out? Was he successful? Once in a while he'd sell something. We managed alright. Your job helped out. Yes. Has anything happened lately that would .. Make you want to get hold of some extra money? Nothing that I know of. You say you left the apartment about 10 o'clock last night. Did he tell you where he was going? Huh? No. Well, when he didn't come back weren't your frightened? No. He was always doing things like that. This wasn't the first time then? Mrs Tanner? - No. Sometimes, he .. He'd get into a mood and .. and stay away for days. Didn't he ever tell you where he'd been? I didn't ask him. He always came back. That's all I cared about. Now .. he'll never come back. Gentlemen. Come in, folks. Mrs Hunter, this is Mrs Tanner. Mrs Michael Tanner. The wife of the dead man. This is Mr and Mrs Hunter and Mr Hannaford. Sit down, won't you. It's alright. I've been having a talk with Mrs Tanner. She tells me her husband was a sculptor. While he didn't have a large income, still he .. Wasn't in desperate circumstances. That makes it a little difficult to understand what happened last night. Mrs Hunter, you told me this morning that .. When he got you inside the house .. He warned you not to make any trouble and then asked for your jewellery. What did he actually say? Well, I .. I don't remember exactly. I think if you try, you will remember. Lieutenant, Mrs Hunter came here to co-operate. If you're going to start .. - Bob. Reynolds, these questions are very hard to answer in front of Mrs Tanner. We all want to get at the facts. That's why I thought if we can get together .. You have the facts and I object to these tactics. You'll go on record as objecting? Under the circumstances, yes. Are you acting as a friend or as Mrs Hunter's attorney? Both. - Larry, please. I have nothing to conceal. I think I can tell you. Thank you, Mrs Hunter. As well as I can remember. He said. "Hand over your jewellery". You lie! She's lying. I know she's lying. - Mrs Tanner. My husband was no thief. He never stole a thing in his life. You killed him! Your murdered him! You know you did. Leave me alone. Leave me alone. She killed him! I know she did. Leave me alone. Leave me alone! I'm sorry. I didn't know she'd go off the handle like that. You might have expected it. A woman can only stand so much. Exactly. I thought we came here to give a written statement. We'll get to it. Only this jewellery business bothers me. You see Mrs Hunter, we haven't been able to establish any motive for robbery. Or proof beyond what you tell us. Tanner has no criminal record. He's never even been arrested. What are you getting at? Maybe robbery wasn't his real motive. Maybe he'd been following Mrs Hunter for quite some time. These .. these fellows do that every now and then. They see an attractive woman and they .. Well Mrs Hunter, I know women don't like to admit it. It's unpleasant and distasteful. But I'm trying to pin this thing down. I'm trying to find out just why .. Tanner waited for you on a night when Mr Hunter was out of town and .. Forced his way into your house. Now, we've had quite a few of these cases recently. Maybe Tanner is the man we're looking for. Mrs Hunter. Did he try to attack you? Chris darling, if there was anything else, tell us. There is nothing for you to be ashamed of. I can't say. I've told you all I know. Well, I won't keep you any longer. We've just got some information that may clear the thing up in a very short time. Are you in a position to tell us what it is? Well. It looks like Tanner was a pretty shady character. Despite not having a police record this may not be the first job he's pulled. We'll let you know as soon as we have something more definite. Now Mrs Hunter, if you go along with the secretary she'll take down a statement. Thank you. Not at all. You've been very patient. By the way, Hannaford. Will you be in your office this afternoon? - Yes. I'll give you a ring. - Right. Send Mrs Tanner in. Darling, hadn't you rather have lunch at home? I don't mind. - Now look you two. Best thing, forget about this as soon as possible and go on living as usual. Come on, I know the head waiter in here. We might even be able to get a table. Well did you get her? Did you get Chris? - No, the line is still busy. I'm sure the maid is dictating the whole thing to a confession magazine. We'll be reading about it under the drier next month. She'll probably call it: "I was there" by Mrs Hunter's maid. Well if I came home and found a strange man in the house. I wouldn't know what to do. You'd give him 48 hours to get out. What about that weekend at Arrowhead when you were supposed to be with me? Joan. Really girls. It's a shame to waste two perfectly good mouths on you two. Well it is revolting publicity. Don't suffer so, darling. After all, it's my relatives who are being splattered over the front pages. Well, personally of course, I .. What's the matter? I don't believe it. Mr Hannaford. - Hello, John. A table for three? - Please. There is such a thing as being too self-controlled. Ah, we're in for it. There is Paula. Unless she is paralysed, she'll be with us in ten seconds. Five. Excuse me, I must go over and say something nice. Where are you going? Why, it would be dreadful if she thought we were avoiding her. She'd be so hurt. Don't worry, dear. We'll act perfectly natural. Well, not too natural. They might throw us out. Bob dear, I am so glad you're back. Paula. - Hello, Larry. Chris darling, I've been trying to reach you all morning. If there is anything I can do .. No thanks, Paula. That's sweet of you. I was terribly worried. - Yes, darling. But I must say you look awfully well considering what you've been through. Really, Joan. I could bite my tongue in half. - You'd have plenty left. Paula, thanks for the interest. It has been a rough start. If you don't mind .. You would like us to leave? - Yes. Well, I don't blame you for not wanting to talk about it. It must have been absolutely hideous. I died for you when I read the morning papers. And the things some people are saying. - What are they saying? Oh, only the ones who don't know Chris. Of course, I denied everything. - So did I. - Me too. Denied what? What are you talking about? Bob, I really don't care. Well you know how some people can be. Paula. - Yes, dear. The story in the paper is true. If you know anyone cooking up gutter-gossip .. For his own amusement, tell him to drop it. Because If I hear about it .. - I will, if I hear one thing, I'll .. Well, I will. That's all. - Paula. Isn't your cocktail getting cold? I've finished it. Then why don't I buy you another. All of you. At your table. We'd better go. The boys are getting upset. And Bob dear, don't be distressed. I've always said if there is one person in this town you can trust it is Chris. Thanks, Paula. I knew I could count on you. Well, naturally I'm on your side. It might be better if you weren't. Come on, girls. I feel a cold wind. Those witches. They ought to be measured for broomsticks. Mr Hannaford. Telephone. Your office is calling. Thanks, John. Chris, darling. - Can we order now, please? Here, you answer it. - Hello? "Mr Hannaford?" - Yes, Miss Prior. "I received an odd call a little while ago from a man with a foreign accent." Well, what did he want? - "He said it concerned Mrs Hunter." Mrs Hunter? "Yes, he sounded awfully strange." - Well, what about Mrs Hunter? "He spoke of the accident last night." - Yes. "He said you'd better call him." - Didn't he leave his name? "No. Just an address." "I'd just ignore it." No, no. I'd better check on it. Give me that address again. "2500 Santa Monica Boulevard." Thanks. Thanks very much. "Yes, sir. Goodbye." I'm awfully sorry. I'm afraid I must skip the lunch. Something has come up. Can't you even stay for a drink? - Got to run. Anything wrong, Larry? - No. You know us lawyers. Neither rain nor shine can keep us away from a writ of Habeas Corpus. I'll stop by on the way home. You'll be with Chris all afternoon, won't you? Yes, I will. - Fine. Well, goodbye. Goodbye. - Thanks, Larry. You don't have to go home with me, darling. I'll drop you at the office. I'm not going to leave you alone today. - But I'll be alright. You sure? - Perfectly alright. Well, I could use a couple of elves. Depressed? - No, but .. Don't let the ladies' hatchet society bother you. I've seen them operate before. Paula says a lot but doesn't mean anything. You don't know how unkind those girls can be. I've seen them. I've heard them. I'd hate to think of someone coming to you with gossip about .. About what? - Oh, anything. They're capable of anything. Darling, it goes in one big ear and out the other. I'm like the third monkey. Hear no evil. Here we are. There will only be two of us. Darling, here is to us. And the three monkeys. Good afternoon. May I be of assistance, sir? Are you the owner of this place? - Yes, I am. I received a call a while ago. My name is Hannaford. - Oh, Mr Hannaford. Yes, yes. I'll be right down. I am very sorry I didn't recognise you but we have never met before. Well, mister .. - Barrow. Martin Barrow. What is it you want, Mr Barrow? Me? I don't want anything. It occurred to me that I might have something that you would want. I hardly think so. You mustn't judge my little shop too hastily. I have many valuable items. Collector's items. In fact several years ago I picked up a little painting .. Mr Barrow, I'm sure you didn't invite me here on a shopping tour. Please get to the point. If you will follow me please. I must apologise for the untidiness. I hope to move soon to better quarters. In fact I know a little shop in Westwood. A lovely place. If I can raise sufficient funds. Do you recognise this? I can't say that I do. Look at it closely. Don't you think it bears a striking resemblance to Mrs Hunter? What if it does? The late morning papers quoted Mrs Hunter's statement to the police. If I remember correctly she said the man was a burglar. And she had never seen him before. That's right. Did you notice the name of the artist? It indicates that Mrs Hunter's statement was maybe not in every respect accurate. Not necessarily. He could have done this from a photograph. Not Michael Tanner. I knew him quite well. Naturally I was familiar with his method of working. Notice the very fine details. Each feature is painstakingly executed. You can't get such a perfect resemblance from a photograph. Don't take my word for it. Call in any expert. They'll tell you the same thing. This was done from the living model. Perhaps he saw her somewhere. And made a sketch of her. Mr Hannaford, you don't really believe that. I don't think you'd find one man in .. Shall we say, twelve? Who would believe it. It's a gorgeous thing. I'm sure Mrs Hunter would love to have it. Possibly. I'll speak to her about it. - Yes, yes. Excuse me. Would you also tell her that I would be willing to make a special price for her. Ten thousand dollars. Ten thousand dollars? Just why do you think it is worth that much? Because the artist is dead, Mr Hannaford. You know how it is with artists. No-one appreciates them when they are alive. After their death, up goes the price, always. Think Rembrandt, C?zanne. Well .. you will admit .. This would be more valuable to Mrs Hunter. Than it would be to the police. I see. In other words, you are attempting blackmail. This is putting it a trifle too strongly. After all .. Extortion is a very serious offence. You can go to prison for it. One to ten years. Did you know it? This is no question of extortion. I am a dealer in fine art. I have been practising law for a good many years, Mr Barrow. I am sure I understand the legal technicalities much better than you do. I have the right to put any figure I see fit on the items in my gallery. Maybe the police won't see it that way. The police? - Yes. I may talk to them. You wouldn't. Believe me, if you proceed any further with this, I will. But Mr Hannaford, please consider the matter more calmly. If it is a question of price we can make some adjustment. There is no need to act hastily. [ Doorbell noise ] Shut up! Get Mrs Hunter on the phone right away please. Oh Mr Hannaford, I'm Mrs Keaton. Oh yes. I telephone you yesterday. - I'll be with you in a few moments. But I .. Dear, I hope it doesn't take too long. I can't put off this divorce another minute. I want to give the papers to my daughter as a Christmas present .. When she comes home from college. Yes. Yes, I'll give him your message. Alright. Goodbye. Good afternoon, Mrs Hunter. - Will you tell Mr Hannaford I'm here. Certainly. Mrs Hunter is here now. I'll be right out. - And last night .. I believe I have all the facts, Mrs Freedley. I'll speak to Jane first thing in the morning. You've got to persuade her not to go through with it. She's only nineteen. And he's such a nice boy. She'd be making such a terrible mistake. If a girl sees her mother get 2 divorces she likely thinks it's the thing to do. Oh, I suppose so. But wait until she gets to be my age. Good day, Mrs Freedley. - Good day. Come in, Chris. Isn't she the one ..? - Yes, Mrs Freedley. You got here very quickly. You sounded so serious. Is it that important? - I'm afraid it is. Sit down. No calls please. Chris, this morning after we left Reynolds' office. Everything appeared to be very simple. To me, your story was honest and straightforward. Sometimes you were hesitant, but I attributed that to an emotional upset. I am fairly sure the police felt the same way about it. Yes. The most important fact in your statement. Was that you had never seen Tanner before. That he was a complete stranger. Are you positive of that? Well, I .. Try to think back. Could you have met him someplace and forgotten? I .. I don't think so. Larry, what's happened since I saw you? The message I had at lunch today was from an art dealer named Martin Barrow. He runs a second-rate shop on Santa Monica Boulevard. He wanted to sell me a piece of sculpture. But he's asking a tremendous price. A blackmailer's price. Blackmail? I don't understand. - It's a head. Of a woman. Done by Michael Tanner. The woman is you. Why, it's absurd. It can't be. What does it mean? - That's for you to say. Perhaps he saw me or saw my picture. I suggested that but I didn't believe it. Nobody else will. It's too coincidental that the burglar killed in your house last night .. Was the sculptor who chose you as his model. Chris, look at me. You did know him, didn't you? Yes. I did. Chris, you know how I feel about you. Not only as Bob's wife but as a very real friend. But right now you're no different than any other client. It?s my job to defend you but I can't do that unless you tell me the truth. Your knowing Tanner changes a simple burglary into a thing much more serious. And I've got to know what that thing is. Do you understand? Alright now. Let's get the story straight. Where did you first meet Tanner? In Santa Barbara. I was spending a weekend there. And Bob was overseas? Yes. Go on. It was in one of the art shops. He was showing some of his work. We had a conversation. Quite casually. When I came back to town he called and said he'd like to do a head of me. You agreed? Well, I was flattered. I thought it would be nice to have. There didn't seem to be any harm in it. Were you to pay him for it? - Yes. When it was completed. What happened? Why didn't you get it? I .. I stopped before it was finished. Why? Well. After the first two or three sittings .. He started paying me little compliments. You know the sort of thing. Nothing serious. He became more and more personal. I sent him a check. And refused to see him again. But you did see him? Not because I wanted to. Wherever I go. To do the shopping. To the hairdressers. Somehow, he'd find me. I begged him to leave me alone, but he wouldn't. Did this keep up after Bob came home? Once or twice. I told him my husband was back and .. And out of the Army. And it seemed to frighten him. I hadn't seen him for months until last night. He must have read something in the paper about Bob being away. He'd never come to the house before. I ordered him out. But he wouldn't even listen to me. He tried to kiss me. To make love to me. It was .. Why didn't you tell all this to Reynolds or to Bob or to me? Why did you lie? I was afraid. Afraid of what? There's nothing incriminating in your story. He tried to attack you and you killed him in self-defence. Well. It wasn't that. I was afraid of what people would say. You know how they talk. You saw Paula and her crowd today. They are dying to make a scandal out of this. I couldn't let that happen. I had to lie. - Nonsense. Those silly girls, they can't hurt you. But lying to the police can. Listen, Chris. You made a bad mistake. We must correct it as soon as possible. What do you want me to do? - Tell the truth. Then we'll get Bob over here and we'll explain things to him. And the three of us will go to Reynolds. I'm sure he'll understand. I'll call Bob. - Wait. I don't want to bother him now. He's so busy. He has so much on his mind. But we shouldn't wait too long. - But I .. I don't want to tell him here. He's been so nervous and jumpy since he came back. I don't know how he'll take it. Bob is no child. He loves you and trusts you. No, Larry. I'll tell him as soon as he comes home. It's better that way. Well. Whatever you wish. He'll be home early. I'll call you. Alright, Chris. Goodbye. Oh, good afternoon, Madame. Mr Barrow? - Yes? I'm Mrs Hunter. Mrs Robert Hunter. - How do you do, Mrs Hunter. I believe you have a piece of sculpture. My attorney said you wanted to sell it. He did? Well that's strange. I offered it to Mr Hannaford. He didn't seem interested. I am. I am willing to buy it. How much do you want for it? I'm sorry. I'm afraid you are a little late. Late? - Yes. You see, Mr Tanner left it with me to sell on consignment. When I read the morning papers I realized that you might want it. But I didn't want to disturb you on such a delicate matter. Where is it? What have you done with it? In as much as Mr Hannaford was so violent in his manner. I turned it over to its rightful owner. Mr Tanner's widow. Oh, Mrs Hunter. What time would you like dinner served? What's that? Would 6:30 be alright? Martha, were there any calls? Just some of the newspapers. I told them to call Mr Hannaford. Thanks. Oh .. Please don't say anything to Mr Hunter about me. I don't want to worry him. Of course, Mrs Hunter. [ Buzzer ] Good evening, Mr Hannaford. - Hello, Martha. Is Mrs Hunter in? - Yes, sir. Larry. Hello, Chris. Have you talked to Bob? - No. He hasn't come home yet. I tried to reach you but you'd already gone to Reynolds' office. Does he know? Know what? - About the statue. Reynolds. Of course not. Well, why did he call you? What did he want? Nothing important. They've set the date for the inquest. Oh. Why? Why do you ask? Larry, you've got to help me. Mrs Tanner has the statue now. Barrow gave it to her. Mrs Tanner? - Yes. You know how she feels about me. She'll take it to the police. We must stop her. When did this happen? How do you know? Barrow told me. I went to his place. You went to Barrow? When you left my office you said you were going home to talk to Bob. What made you change your mind? - Well, I .. You never intended to tell Bob, did you? You weren't going to the police. You lied to me. Larry, please. Chris, what are you afraid of? What's behind all this? Why can't you tell Bob you knew Michael Tanner? Because I .. Stop asking questions. Bob must never see that statue. Isn't that enough? Yes. Quite enough. I'm beginning to understand. I should have suspected. I wouldn't even let myself think of it. But why not? You're no different to the cheating, sly women who parade through my office. Except that you're more of a hypocrite. You can't say anything worse than I've said to myself. But. If you knew how it happened .. I don't want to hear all the petty details. I've heard the same story in a dozen courtrooms. I know all the shabby tricks and tearful excuses. I only want to know what else you're guilty of. What do you mean? You told me you didn't know Tanner. I believed you. Then you told me you only knew him casually. I believed you again. Now, I don't know what to believe. You said you'd tried to avoid Tanner for months. You ordered him out the house. I have only your word. He attacked you and you struck back. Again, you word. That might be good enough lacking any other evidence. But your behaviour today is that evidence. Everything you did since you came to my office has been an admission of guilt. Do you realize what a clever prosecutor can make of this? If it's true that you were intimate with Tanner and lied about it. It could be true that you asked him to your house. If he came at your invitation. It could also be true that you didn't kill him in self-defence. And if you killed him for any other motive. The charge might very well be first degree murder. No. No. It couldn't be. It isn't true. Larry, I couldn't tell you the whole truth. I was ashamed. But I didn't lie about that. He was trying to kill me. He would have killed me. You've got to believe me. I don't know why I should. Whatever you have done, I .. Don't think you're capable of murder. I've made quite a mess of things, haven't I. Yes, you have. I'm sorry. For Bob. Not for me. He hasn't deserved this. I know. The only thing that's made me want to go on. Was the thought that .. Somehow I could keep it from him. And I'm not going to give up now. I must get that statue. Will you help me? Why should I help you? I'm not asking just for myself. I know what this will do to him. It comes a little late doesn't it. This noble concern for your husband. Alright. I'll go to Mrs Tanner. You realize what you're getting into? If the police find out you tried to suppress evidence. Nothing will convince them that you killed in self-defence. I have to take that chance. Then let me warn you. If you tell the truth now you may lose Bob. But if you go to Mrs Tanner you're risking your life. If I lose Bob. My life is over anyway. Do you know how much money they want? Ten thousand dollars. That's a lot. Where could you get it? I have some in my account. I'll get the rest somewhere, somehow. If you've made up your mind there is nothing mare I can say. I am sure the statue is still for sale. Barrow wouldn't give it to Mrs Tanner if he thought she'd go to the police. But don't you call them. That would be dangerous. Let them call you. Chris. - In here, Bob. Hello, darling. How are you? Hello, Larry. - Hello, Bob. Anything new? Nothing especially. I just came by to tell Chris the inquest is set for the day after tomorrow. Oh. Did they find out anything more about Tanner? Yes. It seems he had a little studio in Laurel Canyon. His wife knew nothing about it. And he was pretty heavily in debt. Reynolds seem to think that accounts for the attempted burglary. Sounds reasonable enough alright. I must say those boys certainly do work fast. What do you two look so gloomy about? I guess we're a little tired. It's been a pretty hectic day, especially for Chris. Of course. Suppose I mix you a drink? Both of you. Not for me, thanks. I must be going. Why, what's the rush? Why not stay and have dinner with us? I'd like to get to bed early. I didn't have much sleep last night. Let's make it some other time. - Alright. Goodnight, Chris. - Goodnight, Larry. Goodnight, Larry. See you tomorrow. Sorry I was so late, darling. I got busy at the office and the first thing I knew it was almost 6 o'clock. That's alright. I understand. You know, Larry is a wonderful guy but I'm glad he didn't stay to dinner. You do look tired. We'll make this a quiet evening. Take the telephone off the hook. If anybody comes to the house, Martha can chase them away. Come here. I have this to show you. I haven't told you anything about my trip up north. It was very successful. Of course, I had to practically subsidise the lumber company. And throw in my right arm but it is going to be worth it. While I was away the boys had a chance to finish the sketches. Now you can see what the houses are really going to look like. What do you think of them? They are very attractive. We'll have four different types in each block so the development has variety. If all goes well I'll put up 1,500 of these in the next 12 months. That sounds wonderful. I'm awfully happy for you. For us darling it is going to be a great year. And don't think you haven't helped. I know since I've been out of uniform I've been pretty thoughtless. Left you alone, charged around. Thought only of my business. When I should have thought of you. I had to make up for those lost years. I know. I tell you. Once this deal is set. And the inquest is over, why don't we get out of town? I'll take you up to that Oregon country. I've seen it Chris. It's beautiful. Take a couple of weeks. No .. No business, no worries, no people. And we'll have a real honeymoon. Only this time I won't have to go back to camp on the morning train. Would you like that? I'd love it. It's working out beautifully. Our position couldn't be better. You should have seen her face when I told her that you had the statue. She almost collapsed. She would do anything to get it now. We can double the price. Even triple it. Well? There won't be any price. What do you mean? - I'm not going to sell it. Mrs Tanner. You can't do this. You agreed, you promised. I've changed my mind. I'm not letting her off that easily. I'm taking it to the police. But what about me? Don't you owe me something? I don't owe you anything. But Mrs Tanner, you wouldn't have known of this if I hadn't brought it to you. I did it for your good so we can share. Her money won't get me what I want. Buying the statue means nothing to her. I want to see her suffer the way I've suffered. I want to see her life torn .. Please Mrs Tanner, don't get excited. I know you are in a great emotional distress but .. Let's be practical. What will you gain by going to the police? You don't for one moment think they will give her the extreme penalty, do you? Why not? That's what she deserves. Yes, but they are prominent people. They have influence. Let me tell you a thing. If she went to trial they'll put you on the stand too. Let them. That's what I want. To put yourself in the hand of that attorney? You may have to tell the whole what kind of a man Michael was. I know. He was your husband and you loved him. But no-one knew more than you how cruel he was when he was angry and drinking. And remember. We don't really know what happened at her house. After all, there was a struggle. Maybe she was forced .. - I don't care what happened. He's dead and she killed him. I'm going to make her pay for what she's done. I have a suggestion. If you really want to cause her the greatest anguish. Why not show this to the husband? Don't you think he would pay to avoid a scandal? I am not thinking of the money. I am thinking of what he will do to her when he finds out. There is nothing more unpredictable. Than a husband betrayed. Shall I .. Get in touch with him? Hunter Homes Incorporated. Yeah, hold on a minute. I'd appreciate your getting these out to us as soon as possible. We'll do the best we can. The layout looks great. - Thanks. Mr Hunter, this just came for you. It's marked "personal". Mr Wilson is on the phone. He'd like to talk to you. Thanks, Ray. Hello Charlie. - "How are you, Bob?" I'm fine, thanks. I couldn't be better. "Glad to hear it. How's the wife?" - Oh, she's alright. Of course, it was quite a shock but she's bearing up well. "How'd it go up north?" The trip was great. Everything turned out just the way I wanted it. "Sounds a big deal. How did you swing it?" Well, I put up $15,000 cash, got a loan on the house for another twenty .. And the bank is putting up the rest of the money. As a matter of fact I'm going down in about an hour to sign the papers. "Well this is what you've been waiting for. 1948 should be terrific." Oh, yes. It ought to be a great year. "As soon as you can relax, I must talk with you. Something important." Right, Charlie. - "Give me a ring." Yeah, I'll give you a call. "Well, good luck." - Thanks. [ Buzzer ] Yes, sir? Who did you say brought this? A special messenger. One of the regular companies. Did he tell you who gave it to him? No, he didn't. Oh, that's alright. Thanks. Yes, sir. Darling, I didn't realize how serious it was until I read the morning papers. That Tanner was really an odd one. An artist to begin with. I was engaged to a painter once, and I know. Thank heaven you had a knife. Of course, sculptors are really the worst of the lot. I suppose it's the clay that gets them. Did you see his wife's picture in the paper this morning? "Miss Frump" of 1933. You can't blame a man for doing anything when he's married to a face like that. Of course, it's not as if he were the only one. Every morning you open up the paper. There is another body found on a weed-covered lot. Trust me, the day will come when parents give their daughters brass knuckles .. Instead of a wrist watch for graduation. Now you know I'm the most broad-minded person in the world. But you can't make me believe that sort of thing is really fun. So you know they must be maniacs. Chris. Yes? Darling, you weren't even listening to me. I'm sorry. Would you like some more coffee? - Heavens, no. I'm meeting the crowd downtown. I want those cocktails to have plenty of room. My goodness, you're nervous. Stop looking at your wristwatch. Unless of course, you'd like me to leave? Of course not. - Well, I have to run anyway. I didn't mean to mooch lunch. I just dropped in to apologise of the way the girls acted yesterday. Isn't that Joan stupid? Poor dear. She's just not smart enough to be an idiot. Don't bother to show me out. I know the way. I always look for the exits in case of a raid. Chris, I know you won't believe this. I'm awfully sorry about all this. Too bad we were never friends. Of course, I know you don't approve of me. But then I don't approve of me either. By the way, I read in the paper about the inquest. I'll be there just in case you need moral support. Thanks, but you needn't. Nonsense. I'm as curious as can be. I always wanted to go to morning court. But I thought they'd think I was the defendant. I look so guilty in the morning. Bye, love. - Goodbye. "Hannaford and McGuire." May I speak to Mr Hannaford please. "Who's calling?" - Mrs Hunter. "One moment, Mrs Hunter." Yes? "Larry?" Hello Chris. Have you heard anything yet? "No, I haven't. What about you?" Not a word. I don't understand. Something must have gone wrong. "They could have called me by now. They've had all morning." There is still time. I'm sure you'll hear from them. "Chris, I wouldn't worry about it." Larry. If I don't hear soon. I'll go to her myself. Just a moment. That would be the worst possible thing you could do. But I can't just sit here and wait not knowing what's happening. Can't we do something? I'll go over to Barrow and see what I can find out. I'll call you later. Promise me you won't go near Mrs Tanner. "The police might be watching." Alright. - "Goodbye." Not very elegant, is it. Of course, you understand that I don't live here. Good afternoon. I believe you've met before. Yes, we have. Won't you go inside? I don't quite know how to begin. May I take your hat and coat? Of course you have been informed that Mrs Tanner's husband was a sculptor. Obviously you haven't seen this before. I realize what a shock this is to you. What pain and heartache you must feel. What any husband would feel. But the truth unfortunately is the truth. As Shakespeare so aptly remarked. "O curse of marriage." "That we can call these delicate creatures ours." "And not their appetites." Mr Hunter! Don't! Let him go. He's telling you the truth. I tried to spare you the knowledge of this. I thought you had the right to know. What's Hunter doing in here? Bob, is that you? Yes. I didn't hear you come in. What are you doing home at this time of day? That's a little early for you, isn't it. Is it? Bob, what's the matter? - Nothing. Don't you feel well? When a man is kicked in the stomach and wishes he was dead, should he feel well? What is it? The deal, didn't it go through? No. I have given up the idea. But why? You can't .. - What does a man work for, anyway? His wife. His family. Well, I don't have a family and now it looks like I don't even have a wife. If you've heard anything about me, say it. A man by the name of Barrow took me to see Mrs Tanner. They thought I had a right to know. Well, aren't you going to deny it? What are you waiting for? Come on, say it isn't true. Say you're not a liar, that you weren't unfaithful. Tell me Michael Tanner wasn't your lover. Go ahead. Deny it! I can't. How many more were there? How many I don't know? There was no-one, Bob. No-one. - Why did you kill him? Why didn't you get rid of me? It would have made more sense. Please, Bob. He didn't mean anything to me. Then why, why? - It was a mistake. A horrible mistake. I can't say anything that will make it easier for you. But I want you to know the truth. It happened a long time ago while you were overseas. You must believe that. I'm not trying to hid anything anymore. Why didn't you tell me all this before? Why did you let me get it this way? At least you could have been honest with me. I wanted to. I'd hoped the time would come when I could tell you. When you could understand .. - Understand? Is there ever a time a man understands when his wife's been unfaithful to him? Yes. When there is enough love and closeness. Then there is no need for secrets. No matter how awful they are. How painful to hear. But we never had that. How could we? There wasn't time. We knew each other only two weeks before we married. Then you were gone. - It didn't take you long to forget. I didn't forget. I didn't want to. But you were 6,000 miles away and I was alone. There was nobody. Oh, Larry, Paula. Her friends now and then. During the day there were things to do. But at night I sat alone. I ate alone. I went to the movies alone. I took a walk alone. That must have been tough. They should have given you a special medal. Oh, you won't understand. No man could. But ask any woman who has sat and waited. Who tried to hang on to something real when there seemed to be nothing real. Millions of women waited. They waited decently and loyally. They didn't cheat. I'm not making excuses. There is no excuse possible. I'm just trying to tell you what happened to me. How it happened. I was willing to wait. I thought I was prepared for it. The men I met around town didn't worry me. I was on guard against them. But this man didn't seem to be like that. When he said he wanted to do a head of me. There was nothing personal in it. I thought it would give me something to do. I was there one afternoon. It was the day before New Year's. I had nowhere to go that evening. Even Larry hadn't called. He asked me to stay for dinner. I hadn't heard from you in weeks. I was worried and blue. I stayed just to have someone to talk to. Just to get away from myself for an evening. Instead, I .. - You don't have to go on. Then those letters I hadn't been getting from you. Six of them came in the same mail. I read them. I read and re-read them. Suddenly I felt ugly and dirty and sick. I couldn't stand deceiving you. I wanted to write you and tell you what I'd done. But I couldn't write it. I had to wait until you came back. But when you did, you were so happy. I couldn't tear that down. I couldn't tell you then. I thought that later .. But later never came. Then, the other morning. With the police. I wasn't thinking of that. I wasn't thinking of anyone but you. I couldn't let you be hurt. I had to lie. I suppose you expect me to forgive you? No. I don't expect anything. I guess I'm not civilised enough. The whys and wherefores don't seem to matter to me. It happened and that's all that sticks in my mind. I'll buy the statue for you and stay in the house until this mess is forgotten. Then I'm getting a divorce. If that's the way you want it. That's the way I want it. [ Buzzer ] [ Buzzer ] Good afternoon, Mr Hannaford. Martha. Chris, I went to Barrow's but the place was closed. I don't understand. It doesn't matter anymore, Larry. Bob knows. How did he find out? Did you tell him? No. Barrow and Mrs Tanner. Where is he now? In the study. He is going to buy the statue. We mustn't let him do that. He needs the money for other things. I want to go to the police, Larry. Will you come with me? Of course. Well Larry, what are you doing here? I've just had a talk with Chris. We are going to the police. She wants to make a confession. Did you know about this? Yes. Well, that's great. The rest of the world won't know about it. This is going to be handled my way. There will be no confession. Bob, you don't realise Chris is .. - I don't want any advice from you. Don't blame Larry. When he found out about it he begged me to tell you. Did he? [ Buzzer ] Mr Hunter? Hello, Lieutenant. - May I come in? Certainly. Well, I'm glad we're all here. It makes things simpler. I had a little talk with Mrs Tanner after you left. Mrs Hunter, I'm afraid you will have to come with me. You are under arrest. What is the charge? Suspicion of murder. "A surprise development in the Tanner slaying occurred late today." "When the District Attorney's office ordered Mrs Hunter held for murder." They booked Tanner's widow and the art dealer for conspiracy. No, I'm trying to get a hold of Reynolds now. How about a statement? Do you stand by your wife? - I have nothing to say. Women like her think they can get away with anything. It says they had a love nest in Laurel Canyon. Get a load of that Hunter dame. I will prove to you ladies and gentlemen of the jury by the evidence presented. That the defendant is guilty of murder in the first degree. Is this the knife the defendant held as you saw her standing over the slain man? Yes, sir. Lieutenant Reynolds, this dress has been identified .. As the one the defendant was wearing in her struggle with the deceased. Isn't it true it was in its this ripped condition when you arrived on the scene? Ain't the Hunter case exciting? Yeah, I love highbrow murders. How long were you married to Michael Tanner? - Six years. How did he treat you? - He was always good to me. Then you were happily married? - Yes. Had you ever sold any of Michael Tanner's work before? - Yes. What was the price of the last work of his that you sold? Seventy-five dollars. - How much did you ask for that statue? Ten thousand dollars. - That's all. And now, Mrs Hunter. When your husband went overseas, you were well provided for? Yes. You received regular monthly allotments? - Yes. How many cars do you have in your family? Two. - How many servants? Two. So while you were being supported in comparative luxury .. And he was fighting to protect you and his country. You were deceiving him with Michael Tanner. Did you write to your husband? Yes. - Did you tell him about Tanner? No. Why not? Didn't you think you owed it to him? I didn't want to hurt him. - You didn't want to hurt him? You mean, you realized you'd lose a very comfortable living if he divorced you. I object to that, Your Honor. - Sustained. You say you broke with Tanner some months before your husband returned. Yes. - But you continued to see him? I couldn't avoid .. Did you see him after your husband came back? Once or twice. - He visited your house? No. Did you visit him in Laurel Canyon? - No. Then where did these meetings take place? Well, on the street. Did any of your friends ever see you with him? I don't think so. - Then they were secret? No. Mrs Hunter, you saw Tanner frequently for a period of months in public places. You were not observed and you still maintain they weren't secret rendezvous? They were not. You never encouraged Tanner? - No. You ask us to believe that a grown man pursued you for months. Made a spectacle of himself after you said you were through with him? - Yes. You say that on each of these meetings pleaded with him to leave you alone? Yes. Did he refuse? Yes. - Did he say he loved you? Yes. - Did he make any public scenes? Now and then. - Didn't this frighten you? It made me .. - Did it make you angry? Did it put you under much strain? - Yes. Nevertheless, you did not tell your husband? - No. In other words you were determined at all costs to keep the truth from him? Objection. Sustained. Mrs Hunter. When was the last of these accidental meetings? Several months ago. So until the night he came to your home you hadn't seen him for some time? Yes. - Did you ask him to the house? No. Didn't you phone him and tell him your husband was safely out of town? No. Isn't it true that on that afternoon your husband called you from Portland? Yes. Didn't he tell you he was coming home three days earlier than he expected? Yes. - And it upset your plans? Didn't Tanner come at your invitation? And didn't you try to get rid of him as your husband was returning unexpectedly? That's not true. And didn't he refuse to leave because he was blindly infatuated with you? And you killed him. Because as long as he lived he was a threat to your happiness and security. I object, your honor. That is not a proper cross-examination. Stop talking! Now tell us, Mrs Hunter. Were you living in this city at the time of your marriage? No, I was here on a vacation. Did you do any kind of work before you were married? I was a fashion editor for a magazine. The house you are living in at present. Did your husband buy it for you? No. It was left him by his mother. Did you hire the servants? No. They had been with the family a long time. When Mr Hunter went overseas did you consider taking a small apartment? I object. This line of questioning does not prove or disprove any issue in the case. Why, Your Honor. This subject was opened up by the prosecutor himself. He considered it sufficiently material to go into on cross-examination. And I submit that the witness is entitled to explain on redirect. The witness may answer the question. I will restate the question. When Mr Hunter went overseas did you consider taking a small apartment? Yes, I did. But my husband asked me to stay in the house and keep the servants on. What did you do with your time? During the day I worked for the Red Cross. The USO. I did what I could. Did you go out much during the evening? No. I have very few friends here. You were lonely now and then? Yes. Did you write about this to your husband? No. - Why not? Well, it seemed so trivial compared to what he was going through. I didn't want him to worry. In other words .. You made your letters were as cheerful as possible so as not to distress him? Yes. And was this the reason you did not write him about Michael Tanner? Yes. Now, Mrs Hunter. Did Tanner attempt to blackmail you? No. Did he ever threaten to expose you to your husband? - No. What was his attitude when you first said you didn't want to see him again? He said he didn't believe me. He thought I was leading him on. But as time passed he became more difficult? When he began to realise I meant it. Did you tell him you were in love with your husband? Yes. - What did he say to that? He said I didn't love my husband. That I loved him. That I'd come back to him. What was his reaction when you told him Mr Hunter was out of the service? At first he was frightened. He didn't bother me for a while. Was he resigned to not seeing you again? No. He said that no woman had ever walked out on him before. That I wouldn't either. Do you believe that in the mind of this jealous high-strung man .. Your continued refusal to see him became an overwhelming obsession? Your Honor, I object. This question calls for the opinion of the witness who is hardly qualified. And I object to the infraction counsel uses when he says "hardly qualified". Gentlemen. Both counsels seem to have injected a personal element in their remarks. This will not be tolerated. Objection sustained. Now Mrs Hunter. I want you to tell the jury in your own words. Exactly what occurred in your home on the night Michael Tanner met his death. When I came home. About 1:30 or 2. The defendant has told us a pathetic story. She's tried to paint herself as a lonely and tragic victim of circumstances. But let me remind you of the facts, ladies and gentlemen of the jury. Christine Hunter deceived her husband while he was overseas. And continued to deceive him after he got back. Then, after she had killed her lover, she lied to the police. And by her own admission suppressed evidence to continue that deception. Even after her arrest she made one desperate effort to save her skin. By signing a supposedly frank confession. Bringing forth the preposterous story of self-defence. Is this a woman you can believe? A scheming liar and a shameless cheat. With these sins on her conscience, would she stop at murder? Ladies and gentlemen of the jury. I ask that you find the defendant guilty of murder in the first degree. I don't think I like him. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the physical evidence in this case .. Completely corroborates Mrs Hunter's story. The condition of the room. The torn dress. The fact that Tanner was wearing his overcoat. All these bear witness that he forced his way into her home, attacked her .. And she killed him in self-defence. Nevertheless the prosecution contends that her story is untrue. And she is not to be trusted as she lied to the police and deceived her husband. But let me remind you. She is not on trial for infidelity, nor for lying. She is on trial for murder, and of that she is innocent. I don't intent to make light of the fact that she was unfaithful. But bear in mind that she acted under unusual and powerful circumstances. Have we forgotten the war so quickly? Have we forgotten how many lives were dislocated? How many personal casualties took place far from the battlefield? Mrs Hunter wouldn't have been unfaithful if her husband hadn't been overseas. If there had not been no war she would not be in this court today. Therefore, I beg of you, ladies and gentlemen. In arriving at your decision. Do not allow the defendant's unfaithfulness to cloud the issue. The punishment for that sin must be decided by her husband and society. The facts show clearly that she was attacked by Michael Tanner. And as she had the legal and moral right to do .. She defended herself. That evidence stands uncontradicted and will support only one verdict. That of: not guilty. [ Buzzer ] [ Buzzer ] Well. Paula. Mind if I come in? - Of course not. Has anything happened? Is the verdict in? No. The jury might be out all night. Larry knows I'm here in case anything breaks. I don't know what's taking them so long. It's obvious she's innocent. They probably just want those free meals. Come on over by the fire. It's nice to see you. A best-seller doesn't make very good company on a cold night. Have you had your dinner? No. Sit down. I'll see what I can rustle up. I was just having some coffee. Here you are. Best hash-house style and the price is right. I think I ought to warn you. This view is very deceptive. I moved here to get away from trouble. It followed me right up in the elevator. Apparently yours came up the same way. I'm glad to see you act like a human being for a change. I'm sorry. You don't have to be formal with cousin Paula. Come on. Inside. I hope the chamber of commerce will forgive me, but it's cold out here. Coffee and a cheese sandwich is the only things I can make without a cook book. Cream and sugar? Hmm? No thanks. There you are. It may not be good, but it's strong. Well, what are you going to do about Chris? If the case goes against her, Larry will handle the appeal. No, I mean if they free her. I don't know. Paula, I trusted her and .. I still can't understand her. You never liked her, did you. - I detested her. Maybe it was a slight attack of bad conscience. She seemed a little wholesome for my taste. But If you came here because you thought I'd say something nasty about her .. You're out of luck. I know, you're afraid you've been a little hard on her and .. You want someone to tell you how mean she was to you. Oh, skip it. I'm not going to blast you tonight. Go ahead, it's better than that silent sympathy I'm getting from everyone else. Alright then. Sure, I'm sorry for you. But I'm sorry for her too. I went to see her and believe me that jail is no place to spend thanksgiving. Yeah, that's kinda rough. Oh, she's not complaining. She's bearing up very well. She's worried about you. Doesn't think you look so well. She really loves you, Bob. She should have thought of that before. Two and a half years is a long time. I managed it. - In the South Pacific. Try it on Wilshire Boulevard. Is it my fault I was sent overseas? Listen, you knew you were going when you met her. Let's face it. That's why you married her. I married her because I loved her. Sure. For two whole weeks. How long was that supposed to last her? What you wanted was a whirl and a memory. You wanted a beautiful woman waiting for you. And you didn't want anyone making time with her while you were away. So you hung up a "no trespassing" sign like you'd stake a gold claim. You didn't marry her. You just took an option on her. She could have said no. - While the band was playing? Listen, I was there. I saw you making with that .. Uniform and that "today we live" routine. And then you were off. - Oh, Paula. Do you think a woman can make a career out of looking at a picture? She needs more than a wedding ring and a letter a week to hang on to. And when you came back, did you give her a chance to explain? Did it ever occur to you that she'd been under a strain too? And she might not have been strong enough to stand up under it? You've always been proud, Bob. Too proud to admit that your wife could be anything but perfect. What's a wife supposed to be? A human being, and that's two strikes against anybody. No, I'm not condoning what she did. It was wrong and it was awful. But do you think you couldn't trust her now? Or is it still your manly pride? A man can't throw his pride out the window. - He can try. I've made half the mistakes in the book. I spoiled my marriage because I thought it was something you tried out. Like new drapes for the living room. If it didn't work out quite right you did it over in the spring. But Chris isn't like that. If you give her half a chance she'll be as good a wife as any many could want. I'm sorry. I'm not the forgiving type. No-one thinks he is. The moral aspects of the case don't stop you loving her do they? I'll get over that. - Sure. And how long will it take to find a girl who'll make you as happy as she did? [ Telephone ] Hello? - "Paula, this is Larry." Oh, hello Larry. - "Have you seen Bob?" He's here. You want him? "The jury is back in." - Oh. "Tell him Chris has been acquitted." I'll tell him. - "I'll take her home." Sure, Larry. Thanks. Well, Chris has been acquitted. Oh. The least you can do is go home and congratulate her. Yeah. Hello Larry. - Bob. I'm glad about the trial. You did a fine job. I'm very grateful. Thanks. Where is Chris? Upstairs. She'll be down in a minute. She's packing. She doesn't have to do that. I'll go to a hotel. It's not a matter of going to a hotel. She's leaving town. You mean, tonight? I was lucky to get a reservation. Where is she going? She wants to stay with her sister for a while. Goodbye, Martha. Goodbye, Mrs Hunter. Take good care of yourself. Bob. Chris. Larry just told me you were leaving town. Yes, I am. I didn't know if I'd see you. I left a note upstairs. Isn't this kind of sudden? Not exactly. I've had plenty of time lately to make plans. But there are a lot of things we ought to settle. If it's about the divorce Larry knows where to get in touch with me. There is no rush about that. I can wait until it's convenient for you. There is no need to postpone it. I asked Martha to pack my trunks. I'd appreciate it if you'd send them on. Of course. I also gave her the car keys. But it's your car. I could send it on to you. No thanks. I won't need it. Well, what about the house? The furniture and things? They are as much yours as they are mine. Whatever you decide. If there is anything you want .. - No. Nothing. Larry, shouldn't we be getting to the station? We still have a few minutes. Since neither of you seem interested in the details of the property settlement. I suggest you use the time to discuss something more important. There is nothing more to discuss. - Are you sure? Look, Chris. I'm not trying to tell you two what to do. You are both grown up and intelligent. But a great many people come through my office with marriage problems. I give them the best advice that a bachelor can. I should at least do as much for my friends. There is no problem, Larry. Bob wants a divorce and so do I. I know. I know. That was understandable at first. Bob was hurt and disillusioned. You accepted his decision as you felt you hadn't the right to do otherwise. But now that you've both had time to think. Do you still believe that divorce is the best solution? It's .. it's the only sensible one. Do you, Bob? Under the circumstances I suppose Chris is right. But you are not positive? Larry, please. Let's not talk about it. I know it's painful. But believe me it will be a lot more painful if you two try to live apart. Remember you had the makings of a good marriage. You had fun together. You respected each other's minds. There was a love and consideration that was growing every day. That is something rare and valuable. You can't throw it away and forget about it. We have to forget it. There is nothing left. I don't believe that. I don't believe those things can destroyed so easily. You can't expect us to pick up the pieces and go on as if nothing happened. I didn't say it would be easy. You will face many difficulties. Some people will call you a weakling if you take Chris back. Some will never accept her. She's a lot of payments to make for what she's done. Perhaps you couldn't go through with it. But if you could, you'd have something fine. A marriage that's been tested and found right and good. Sure. Take your problems to the divorce courts. You have plenty of precedent. 3,000 people a month in this city .. Run out on their marriages as they haven't the courage to make them work. But that's not for you. What would you gain? Nothing but a sense of failure and frustration and bitterness. A divorce that isn't necessary is cowardly and shameful. Every marriage has it's challenge. You've had the most violent. When you stood at the altar you didn't just accept the virtues you both had. You agree to live with one another's weaknesses and mistakes. And that takes strength and tolerance. And understanding. Chris, if you're willing to talk of it. - You could never trust me again. I didn't say that. But it wouldn't be fair to you. What I'd done would hang over you for the rest of your life. I'd still like to talk about it. Good. Well, here are the ti?kets. I don't think you'll need them. Goodnight. Goodnight, Larry. Oh, by the way. I usually charge clients of your standing around $2,500 for a divorce. In this case I really wouldn't m?nd losing the fee. * steve d *
