Hello don't forget the lecture today attendance is mandatory I know still sleeping? I haven't been sleeping well recently lots of dreams stop reading that guy's novels he was insane bullshit! See you later then mom, I'm off to school don't forget to come back home for dinner tonight I remember it's the anniversary of dad's death he hasn't been able to enjoy my cooking so you take his place should I follow in his footsteps? Never! A seaman is like a dead man to us you are my only son you are my only mom I will be with you forever you also have your girlfriend Joey invite her for dinner tonight I haven't seen her for a long time alright. I'm gonna be late I have to go. Bye excuse me. Thanks I thought you wouldn't come this is my final year. Can't afford any mistakes lam not you. I have to earn a living how is auntie doing? As usual, she loves to keep herself busy she invited you for dinner it's the anniversary of my dad's death that means we have to pray to that alter ancestors worship is different from idol worship if you don't come again, she'll think we have broken up we have you have fallen in love with that Japanese writer even with someone long dead you are still jealous this is very kind of you like what they always say in Greece time is the best cure indeed class, attention please today is the first lecture for the cultural studies class this year we are honored to have the distinguished professor Antonio ming as your instructor he is a famous scholar in the areas of ancient Greek culture and utopian thought visiting from the Australian national university wishing you all a great course this year thank you Dean I am Antonio but you are welcome to call me brother ming to get things going, let's do a little experiment those of you who are gay, please raise your hands none? Okay, how about those of you who have had either gay sexual experiences or dreams? Also none surely some of you must have gay friends or at least empathy for gays? Let me put it out there then; I am a homosexual! The ancient Greece of 2500 years ago was the era of socrates, Plato and Aristotle it was a period in history when mankind achieved the greatest leap in spiritual civilization our understanding today of freedom, democracy and government is mostly coming from the theories of those great philosophers what's that got to do with homosexuality? In those days all grown men not only had wives but if they were to be fully respected, they had boyfriends too the more numerous, the younger the more handsome and the more intelligent the better why? In those days, the exchanges between men from metaphysical intelligence to physical sex were not only legal, but also perceived to be noble professor can you please take down that image? Miss I think you are an adult and yet you are uncomfortable viewing a male's body? No I just think you should respect the religious beliefs of some of us here are you catholic? Yes homosexuality is a sin. Preaching homosexuality is sinister but didn't your pope recently say that "lf a person is gay and seeks god and has good will who am I to judge them?" Who are you lady? In "the Republic", Plato said that in an ideal community where schools flourish only music and mathematics should be taught there is a famous quote from socrates "an unexamined life is not worth living" come in professor please, call me brother ming yes, brother ming I came to apologize for my girlfriend's impoliteness what's her name? 309v is there a reason that one person has to apologize for another living one? You are right but she has always been like that why didn't you leave when she left? That's another reason why I came oh? Young people these days seldom read the novels of mishima yukio really? It has been a while since I last read them too it maybe time for me to revisit his work especially the final pieces, the tetralogy professor, no, I meant brother ming ls there a link between mishima's suicide and the martyrdom of socrates? Mishima was very complicated though he tried his best to explain himself he could hardly be understood socrates was far more simple and straight forward the reason for his martyrdom was similar to that of the ancient Christian, Saint Sebastian these people chose death as they believed they couldn't live a poetic life any more poetic? They were poets those poets cared only about god's appraisal not the perspective of the secular world I think that the reason you came to see me is that you are attracted by the works and the physicality of homosexuals so you are confused I have a girlfriend and I don't doubt my sexual orientation but I have the same feelings as the young mishima like the fascination with our own bodies masculine male bodies have been showing up in my dreams following today's lecture I decided I want to learn more about this aspect of myself what is your name? Hins gao ming means brightness and gao means brilliance we will be a good match you two quarreled again? We will be okay in a few days honesty is a virtue I know like what you say you lie once, you cover up for life morn don't you have anything you've hidden from me? What do you mean? I mean, dad is long gone haven't you ever wanted another partner? You want to dump this burden called morn? I see my dad often in my dreams I can't imagine there being one in real life I also feel anguish for what you have been missing but it is all fate try this a drink, lady? We have asahi and 1664 on tap I want the French one one moment are you studying nearby? No I am actually a transport worker I work part time here at night no wonder you have such a good figure sis, so what do you do? Sis? Do I look that old? You look 25, but I am only 22 you are 22? Then I am 18 see you bye hey handsome I'll buy you a drink I can't drink at work when will you be off? We stay open until the last customer has left then, I am off so by this logic I can never buy you a drink? Right but maybe you are smart enough to figure out a solution for me I am swan lam hins hins? That sounds familiar haven't we met? I wouldn't forget if I have ever met such a beauty you kind of look like my morn Jesus! In just an hour I have aged into a morn I suppose you are Joey? I am swan I am the substitute teacher you may call me sister swan you sing. I'll accompany you "at that moment" "love was fading" I am sorry it doesn't matter let's do it again would you rather your rival in love be of the same, or opposite sex? I don't want rivals I would rather turn them into friends sis, you are avoiding my question if I really have to choose I would rather it be a man why? Isn't it more shameful losing out to one of the same sex? Strange logic if you apply normal logic to abnormal matters you may never get an answer answer... Brother ming! It's you! Why are you here? Are you looking for Antonio? Yes you are his student? Yes it is still early you can wait for him there any chance that you are the "mishima yukio" boy? So he did mention me! You are his... Lam... His research assistant what a coincidence did he say anything about me? He sure did why are you so interested? For sure, every student would care about his teacher's feeling towards him in what way? Any... way but, forget it why are you nervous? Do you have feelings for him? You are being provocative what is the worry? I have feelings for him too we are in the same boat I could be your adviser so Open up to me and tell me anything but there is nothing to tell. We are innocent why do you care about views of others? And besides, what's the big deal about being bisexual? You live only once but can experience two different kinds of love and lust isn't it the utopia of life? How wonderful! You are going too far how about your girlfriend does she know? If something were to happen, i would tell her for sure although I am not religious, i will never lie to her so cute! You are my type yet the most important thing is to be true to yourself once you have lied to yourself you can never say you are not a liar well? Have you been introduced? Sure we are like old friends already we are just done later she is very attractive isn't she? Got some free time on Sunday? Let me help you to expand your horizons don't be shy this boat trip is especially for you I had no idea there would be so many people and all so... bold that's the way to help you understand come on your turn! We are playing cards you are? Oh, you got a friend I'll go take a shower what do you mean? What do you mean then? Who is he? A friend fflend? Who on earth would bare it all in a friend's room? Is there a problem? Don't you like it? Do you even care? Shall I introduce him to you? Who knows... What the hell are you talking about? Do I need to elaborate? You fell in love with that faggot you are no longer a man stop it! We are not married yet god won't allow it ls there anything your god actually allows? Can we not argue about this, please? How about I use my hand... Leave me alone for awhile ls everything alright? It's okay someone changed her mind and come back for my lecture please leave my boyfriend alone you mean hins? I can't leave him he came to me it is useless for you to keep tormenting him he likes girls and he loves me only love? Corinthians 13:5 says "love is patient and kind love does not envy - or boast..." - Enough! A scholar like you should be popular among girls why do you have to commit the sin of homosexuality? Sin? It is the church in the secular world who rejects gays not god god created heterosexuality, bisexuality and homosexuality in what order? Are you telling me you know the answer? Let's say it is all love even if you do really love him but then do you have to compete with me? We've been together for three years he isn't your type I appreciate a good intellectual discussion like this how about we don't compete which lets him love us both and how about if you and me are in love as well? Ridiculous! How could such be shared? You mean love has to be unshared and exclusive? If you have brothers or sisters would your morn love only one of you? You are being sophistic they are two different things the truth is revealed through debates many so called doctrines falter in the face of intellectual examination Lenin once said "prejudice is further away from truth than ignorance" I give up lam not fighting you on this let's compete in something else then I suppose you play piano? Let's have a duet Beethoven wrote this for his 17 year old student they had a love affair which were not acceptable in the secular world they could only express their love through music the manuscript was found years after his death was such love a sin? Is it possible for love to be a sin? I'm going bye we are closed I'll wait for you in the yard may I have one? Sure I wonder if I should see him again so the boat trip didn't go well? He told you everything you can tell me everything too lam a pretty good listener I want to understand the world and myself as well but by going deeper I am worried I will turn into another person and do something I will regret and then? I may lose my grounding and not be able to find my way into my new world you are beginning to speak like him maybe I don't deserve such a teacher if he was a girl or I were one, everything might be more natural let me tell you a legend among the students of socrates there was one extraordinarily young and handsome whose name was alcibiades alcibiades the name of this city, means "city of angels" you must have been to a lot of places? I have been to eighty countries and then I found an utopia, right here eighty! Oh, right you said there is a gym down there I want to work out you might want to walk around too and I will take you to dinner later I am going to rest for a bit you efljoy okay hey toffi I am back the swimming pool is great I came back to get my swim suit so this is your "city of angels"? Utopia? Instead of cursing happiness why not be part of it? You intended me see all that right? I guess it was just meant to be you want me, don't you? Is it not obvious? I would exchange it with the most precious thing in my life what if I decline? Then life would be less poetic yours or mine? Mine or maybe ours ls that the temple of dawn? That's right temple of dawn where Mr. Honda visited Princess ying in mishima's novel so it is real, look! The temple of dawn does exist! I can't believe I am seeing it this is not a dream, is it? Such a kid wait till I take you to the golden pavilion and even the Ganges I wonder how excited you will be... Do you believe in reincarnation? Does this scene remind you of the dream of Honda? Yes from this paragraph: "All ideas and all gods were jointly turning the spiral nebula like gigantic wheel of samsara carrying masses of people who were happy, angry, sad or joyful just like us, unaware of the rotation of the earth unaware of the effects of samsara it was like a Ferris wheel at night all decorated with lights in the amusement park of the gods" if only we can live our lives like those poets writing and leaving behind such beautiful poems whether there is an afterlife where we may reincarnate to would they matter at all? Right a student of socrates alcibiades told his teacher "i tried everything to get intimate with you, all for your wisdom instead of being ridiculed by a Sage for not seizing the chance of my life I would rather be insulted by all ordinary folks of the world until I die" tell me what is love? Tell me! Isao why are you angry? Lam not angry at anything! You came to say farewell isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't... I just can't take it I don't want to live life is meant to be painful pain is the foundation of life the bigger the pain, the wiser we become sis you must have the wisdom teach me how to forsake love I can't I can't do it sis l. Have just done the least poetic thing possible It was my own initiative nothing to do with my teacher that is not the point, kid you are not 21 yet legally you are still considered underage for having sex with a man you broke the laws of Hong Kong what?! Better learn the law before you become gay my teacher just returned from abroad and couldn't have known this ls ignorance an excuse? This is not a TV drama the law exists without favoritism or mercy he is the adult in this. He will face quite severe charges imprisonment is inevitable sign this confession I have nothing to declare write it down you please you are a man of stature how can you partake in such immoral acts? I may have violated your laws but I am not sinful hins gao somebody bailed you out pack your things and come out he is back how was your trip? Why didn't you call me and let me know you would be late? I wondered what happened to you something did happen but I can fix it don't worry, morn you're leaving again! I will be back for dinner boys won't stay with you forever defendant Antonio ming is alleged to engage in sex with a man under 21 years of age he is to be remanded in custody, with no bail, pending trial the other defendant hins gao is alleged to have participated in gay sex while under the age of 21 he is to be released on bail to await further investigation the aforementioned hearing will take place in 14 days lift up your head, man there is nothing you cannot conquer 21 years old, why precisely 21? It would be fine if only you were one year elder wasn't Hong Kong under British rule? People in britain can choose their sexual pleasure from the age of 16 onwards we are the ones to belittle ourselves by accepting this discrimination hins, it's a pity you were born in Hong Kong I was not born here! My dad was a Hong konger, but my morn was a mainlander they gave birth to me in China before coming to Hong Kong my dad was a seaman, who ran into a wreck my morn told me... Hey! She told me that I am actually a monkey the birthdate on my ID was amended for some reason monkey? Then you are already 21! Morn ls there anything you couldn't forgive me for? I can see you are troubled by something tell me your mom can handle anything mom, you didn't answer my question son you are a man and mature enough to make your own decisions whatever you have done, right or wrong, your morn will always support you if I really have to pick something then it would be for leaving me I have had a relationship with my teacher that kind of relationship? How terrible! The teacher is out of line I bet she is not older than me probably... not how about Joey then? Have you broken up? No We won't you are cheating on her? You men; You're all the same! My teacher... Is a man what?! Good man you knew everything up there, right? You will forgive me I, leung yi zhun, solemnly, sincerely and truly declare and affirm that the evidence I give in this court is the truth and nothing but the truth your honor I have only a few simple questions for Ms. leung, our witness Ms. leung there are two mainland birth certificates of the defendant can you please tell us why there can be two certificates for one person? Hins this is the only thing i have ever hidden from you it has been more than 20 years now yet it is still like yesterday in my memory a few days after my wedding who's that? Shu Juan help me, sister zhun take care of this baby for me they are coming to take me! Shu Juan! My best friend shu Juan rushed to my home with her new born son a young life was gone, just like that the poor woman was dumped by her man after becoming pregnant she lost her mind after giving birth to the baby I had to follow my husband to Hong Kong but there was no way i could leave this poor baby behind amid the confusion an idea occurred to me my husband was a merchant seaman who had to leave on a journey shortly after our wedding night he was then going to be gone for two or three years I got a friend in the hospital to make the baby a new birth certificate the birthdate was set at ten months later I then brought to my husband this "joyous news" as well as hins who would then "reunite" with this supposed father of his can you tell us then the exact birthdate of the defendant? 28th march, 1992 which means the actual birthdate of the defendant was about ten months earlier than that on his ID card ls that so? Right your honor, I have no more questions Ms. leung the fassbender like story you have just made up is very intriguing indeed I don't know this term but I never lie you never lie? Didn't you start lying 20 years ago? Indeed“. I thought I could hide the truth forever you lie once, you cover up for life do you also know that counterfeiting documents is a serious crime? It could put you in jail objection, your honour the prosecution is raising an impossible accusation that's alright I knew this lam willing to pay for my wrongdoing but I can never let my son bear the responsibility Ms. leung didn't you just claim he is not your son? What are you talking about? Although he is not my son by birth he will always be my son! Morn mqm! Lam going to jail finally I can rest and do some studying maybe morn, you will be alright a lawyer friend told me that even if you are found guilty it would be a light sentence for telling white lies lam not so sure about that these days, Hong Kong resembles China in the old days anything can happen you better fly away if possible I told you I won't leave you don't forget to feed the tortoises my friend also told me that on the basis of civil laws and human rights and by dealing with some procedures I could be spared of being repatriated back to mainland China that is great news! That was my only concern men should be explorers your mom won't be holding you back for long maybe I will find a soulmate after I am released from jail mom you are so beautiful you're going to tie up this street with your admirers stop bullshitting beauty belongs to the young once it's passed, it shall never return my teacher also said that once you and your teacher will you continue? Perhaps because your dad passed too early and I wasn't sure how to raise you it is not like that actually there are many kinds of love we just... I know that too I have also read "the dream of red mansions" even that son of nobility had slept with men too love yourself and be respectable your mom isn't going to worry about this anymore they are your blood parents you'd better keep it better learn the law before you become gay I don't need this there is nothing missing in my life Are you kidding me? The teacher was not guilty but the mother was! What's wrong with this world? Luckily she isn't being imprisoned otherwise there is no justice sis, you are so talented we are blessed I am the blessed one there is a cantonese saying: "Good at the kitchen and the living room" for my kind of man add to that "good in the bedroom and the classroom" what a perfect woman shall we really tell them? What's the secret? Don't you have any idea who I actually am? My god! Sis swan, you can't be... Mrs. ming! The stupid kids finally got it we have been married for over a decade you may now call me madam ming but, you'd better not we would rather die than age time builds a relationship, but sensuality comes from unfamiliarity after being together for years, we both need new excitement we also miss the feel of young flesh I let him be socrates and enjoy the role of his accomplice you... Are the new blood having been seduced into joining... Our utopia of love and lust let's have the last class don't just watch practice among yourselves brother ming was dismissed by the school this is not the place for us we shall look for our utopia elsewhere are you really leaving? Back to Australia first, then to Thailand shall we go with you? Hins has to take care of his mom, right? Right we better stay to open up new ground and new minds for this utopian ideology that's what my good students would say Class, I am your lecturer but you are welcome to just call me hins if anyone of you is a homosexual like me raise your hand let's give this classmate a big hand in an ideal community where schools flourish only music and mathematics should be taught there is a famous quote from socrates "an unexamined life is not worth living"
