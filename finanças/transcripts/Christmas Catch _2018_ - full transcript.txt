♪ ♪ (indistinct laughing and talking) (bell ringing) And that's when I told my mother that I didn't know yet if I would be bringing someone to Christmas dinner. Well, our bad guy is kinda cute. Maybe you should ask him out to Christmas dinner. Ha! Yeah, she'd love that. The first time I bring a date to Christmas and he's a two-bit counterfeiter. Hey, at least he has the money for a nice bottle of wine. We've been here over an hour. Any longer and I might buy a tree. Don't you already have two in that tiny apartment of yours? Right, maybe I'll get you one. Do you prefer the White Pine or the White Spruce? Which one's which? It's easy, pine trees bear needles in groups of two to five and they tend to be longer. So they're harder to decorate but gives you fuller look in the end. Why do you know so much about Christmas trees? Ah, because Christmas is the best time of year and the tree is the best part of Christmas. You're almost as bad as your mom. (big sigh)I just want our buyer to show up so we can arrest these clowns. I'm freezing my jingle bells off out here. Give it a few more minutes, then I'll take another shift. (Man in background) I've been waiting here for over an hour. We might not have a few more minutes. Our guy's about to bail. What do you want to do here Reid? Stall him, Mack. We need him to stick around until the buyer shows up. Okay, any ideas genius? Tell her to flirt with him. Ah, that's not a good idea. What did you say? Oh, nothing. Brian had a terrible idea. Yeah, well come up with something better. Our guy's about to leave. I'm telling you, have her flirt with the guy until the buyer gets here. (Mack) We need to hurry guys. Okay, Mack - flirt with him. What? That's right, we think you should flirt with him until the buyer shows up. Seriously, that's your plan? Well actually it's Brian's idea. I think it's a horrible plan. Because it is a horrible plan. I know you can do this, Bennett. There's no way that she can do this. Why is it such a terrible plan? Because you have never seen Mackenzie Bennett try to flirt. Come on. Is it that bad? You ever seen the video of the Hindenburg going down in flames? Hey, I'm not Hindenburg bad. Really, what happened to Peter? Again, bringing up Peter? (big sigh) Watch this. Stop doing your sexy walk, Mack. Hey. What? Can I help you find a tree? Do you work here? No, but I do know a lot about Christmas trees. Why? Because Christmas is awesome and so are Christmas trees. Tell her to lick her lips. I'm not telling her to lick her lips. (Man) Are you licking your lips? (Reid) Top lip Mack, top lip, top lip! Maybe wink at him. Ma'am do you need help? Oh, no he didn't. Excuse me? Did you just call me ma'am? -No. -Yeah, ya did. Listen buddy, I'm 32. That's only two years older than... -I mean... -Wait, wait. Why do you know how old I am? -You're a cop! -No. We've been made, he's on the run. (Mack) Meet me at the back of the alley. (car brakes screeching) (car stops suddenly) (Man) Ahh! My arm! Ahh, my arm! (grunting and groaning) Reid, did you see that tackle? Gotta be one of my best yet. Yeah Bennett, nice tackle. Ahh, my arm! You broke my arm! Settle down. I didn't break your arm. Santa? Detective Charles, if you don't have your report on my desk in an hour, I swear I'll make you work Christmas morning. And I don't care how cute your twins are. (Det. Charles) Yes Captain. Right away. Right away. And you two. I'm actually mad at you. Get in here. You broke his arm. What, neither one of you chatter boxes has anything to say? -We were... -Not you, arm-breaker. What the heck happened out there Parks? Well, a, ah, situation arose where the entire mission, ah, hinged on, ah... I'm dying of anticipation here. Detective Bennett's ability to flirt. Flirt? Yes, in order to keep the suspect around for the drop, Mack suddenly had to flirt with him. Good grief, she had to flirt? That sounds like a plan that idiot Brian would come up with. We're lucky he only ended up with a broken arm. Okay that's enough. Mistakes were made, I apologized, but we got them. Correction, we got one of them, and we're lucky he had the counterfeit money on him. How bad was the flirting? It was pretty bad ma'am, a man's arm was broken. Hahaha, guys. Very funny. (Captain Bennett) It's not funny. Do you know how many of my friends have grandchildren and you can't even get a date to Christmas dinner? My dog, Bunchy, has more dates than you. Mom! I don't care that I am your Mother. In this office it is Captain. Yes ma'am. Is it the shoes? It's the shoes, isn't it? The shoes aren't helping the situation Captain. I'm right here. There must be something we can do. I've tried. But... But what? She's going to an event tonight. A Christmas singles' mixer her friend is having at the coffee shop. Give the woman some hope. A Christmas singles' mixer. I like the sound of that. You like it because the word Christmas is in there. I'll keep the paramedics on standby. You two are jerks. I have work to do. -Ah, Mackenzie. -What? All kidding aside, tonight... Yes, "Captain"? Wear a different pair of shoes.(chuckles) (big sigh) ♪ groovy music ♪ (indistinct chattering) Well, look who finally showed up. -And wearing heels? -Wow! Who are you and what have you done with our friend? Hahaha guys. Very funny. -I'm sorry I'm late. -That's okay. -Great turnout Ken. -Thanks. Well, I'm just glad you got here before all the cute guys left or got hit on by Jess. I swear it's like shooting fish in a barrel. Well, don't look too excited. Just thinking about work. Oh hey. How is that cute partner of yours, Reid? Still like a brother to me. And you can't date him either. Really? I'll let you know if that changes. All right. Stop being such a hopeless romantic. Okay, look, we have a coffee shop full of single men here. Uh huh. That's all I want for Christmas. There's gotta be one here for you. -I just... -What? I don't think I'm going to meet the man of my dreams at some cheesy Christmas singles' night. Ouch! No offense, Ken. None taken. But Mack, you gotta open yourself up to meeting guys no matter how it happens, right? Like Jess does and look at her. Exactly. And look, no matter how much you want it, you're not going to meet Mr. Right the same way they do in the movies. That's right. But even my parents, with my mother as tough as she is they have a great story of how they met. Um hmm. Look, how about I go over there and ask those guys to come join us? The one in the reindeer antlers looks nice. I don't want my friends to have to find some reindeer guy for me. I want the way I meet a guy to be magical, I want it to be... (Ken and Jess together) Serendipitous! (Ken) Oh oh oh... It looks like Santa dropped off my gift early this year. (cell phone rings) It's work. I gotta take this. Hurry back. The young one here works fast. (Mack) Yes, the force is strong with this one. (Jess) Are you Christmas? 'Cause I want to marry you. (cell phone ringing) Hey Reid. (Reid) So how's it going at the coffee shop? (laughs) Great, it's a sea of hair gel and cologne in there. Just give me a second. Beautiful! (chuckles) Are you drooling over a guy? (Mack) Not a guy. A Christmas tree at the station. (Reid) You talk to anyone yet? Mack? I gotta let you go. Whoa, Whoa! Are you okay? Are you hurt? No, I'm okay. Only because you caught me. Ha, lucky timing. I'm sure there's a joke in there about you being a great catch. (Mack giggles) I'm Carson. Hey Carson, I'm Mackenzie. -Nice to meet you. -Nice to meet you. You know, I'm on my way to this Christmas singles' night to hopefully pick someone up, but I'm not sure this is what I had in mind. (they both laugh) Ah... So you're into the singles' night? Ah yeah, it was my buddy's idea. Um, are you here for the singles' night? Yeah. No. Well kinda. My friend Ken owns the coffee shop, so just going to support him. Oh, so you're not single. No. I'm very single. Just ask my mother. Is your ankle okay? I'm sure it's fine. 'Cause you look great in those heels, but they seem rather dangerous. Don't blame the heels. If you think I look good in them then they're doing their job. You're beautiful. It's not the heels. (cell phone rings) Looks like someone's trying to get a hold of you. I don't care. Can I tell you something? Sure. You ah, you have glitter in your hair. Of course I do. It's so typical of my dating life. Is this a date? No, no. I just meant... (cell phone rings) Shoot. Look, I was just kidding. Um... You know, running into you tonight was more... Serendipitous than anything. What did you just say? Serendipity, it means... (both together) A happy accident. (text notification) Is everything okay? It's work. I'm sorry. Thanks for catching me. Anytime. (door slams) I hope this is important, Reid. -Counterfeit man. -What? The other perp we were waiting for at the tree lot, we found him. Ugh. Just my stupid luck. Oh, no. You look so nice. How'd it go? Well, it was going amazingly well until I got a thousand texts messages from, hm, let me see here... You! Counterfeit man! This is so ticking me off right now. You wore heels! Yeah well, a lot of good they did me. (Reid) That's him? (Mack) He messed up my chances with the perfect guy? I got this. (door slams) Just don't beak his arm. (Carson V.O.) Running into you tonight was more... Serendipitous than anything. (Mack V.O.) What did you just say? (Carson V.O.)Serendipity, it means... (both together V.O.)A happy accident. (alarms goes off) Hi, I'm Mackenzie. Hey, I'm Mackenzie. They're not even that comfortable. It's actually kind of like, easier to walk in them. Take you down to the station. Good job last night guys, especially you Mack. You really showed some progress. Thanks Captain. I'm kind of proud of myself too. I went out on a limb, wore heels, talked to a cute guy... Detective, what are you talking about? The coffee shop guy I met last night. Well congratulations, but I was talking about the perp you managed to apprehend without breaking an arm. Oh. Thanks. But I'm glad you met a cute guy. Way to multi-task. In my office, now. Ah, this is Ms. Robertson. It's Special Agent Robertson, Captain. Thank you. Of course. This is Special Agent Robertson. She's with the FBI. This is Detectives Bennett and Parks... It's a pleasure to meet you both. Special Agent, would you like to sit? That's a lot of Christmas trinkets. I prefer to stand. Agent Robertson, what is the FBI doing in our little police station? Oh, the FBI would like our assistance. Captain, doesn't your precinct have rules against such displays of holiday expression? Religion and all. The Captain views those regulations more as suggestions than hard rules. How can we help you, Special Agent? Well, the FBI has been keeping a watch on a person of interest for almost a year now. Mr. Mills. He recently moved to your city. A criminal moved to our city and you didn't inform us? Holly Christmas pound cake! We're informing you now, Detective. Last year during the holiday season, Mr. Mills and his now ex-wife, known only as Bethany, lead a diamond heist that went sideways. They made off with a diamond encrusted reindeer. The ex-wife fled the country. A diamond encrusted reindeer? That sounds beautiful. Actually, it's horribly tacky. But it's worth just north of three million dollars. And this Mr. Mills, why didn't he leave the country too? The FBI could never prove his involvement. But we're hoping that a stakeout might lead us to some new information and possibly the reindeer. -A stakeout! - Detective Bennett. If we find that reindeer, we can prove his involvement. So why does the FBI need us? You guys don't have your own cameras and binoculars? The FBI is spread a little thin, Detective, terrorists and all. Besides we feel that a local law enforcement with local knowledge would help us out greatly. And why now at Christmas time? Well like most retailers, jewelry stores sell a much higher volume of product, including diamonds, during the holiday season. The FBI believes that Mr. Mills will either try and sell the stolen reindeer, or even worse, get together his old team and rob another store while there's inflated inventory. If the FBI would like our assistance, we would be proud to help. So, you want my partner and I to spend the days leading up to Christmas sitting in a dark room with binoculars? Exactly. You are not to engage with Mr. Mills in any way. If you or your partner find any evidence of the diamonds, please, call me immediately. Captain... It's our pleasure to assist the FBI in any way that we can. Good. -Isn't it? -Of course. Carson Mills, 32. All his information is inside of these files. The house across from Mr. Mills is for sale, but we have rented it for you. -Mack, you okay? - Mm, hmm. (big sigh) You have the worst luck, Bennett. I know. And stop looking at his photo. -Ah, he is cute though. -Right? Alright, we've got a job to do. Great. We're professionals. Exactly, law enforcement professionals. Right. Now what do we do? Well, Brian just confirmed the subject is at work, so you help me unload the gear. So that's his place, huh? Yup. And this is us. Home sweet home. Oh! We should decorate inside too! Nope. It would help with our cover. No it won't. It's already decorated! Great. This seems to be the best vantage point. We've got a clear view to his front door, kitchen and what seems to be his bedroom. Let me see. Bennett. Bennett! Hey! How are we going to handle this? Handle what? Well you obviously like this guy. A lot. Yeah. And now you want to look through a telephoto lens into his bedroom. Usually we arrest people for this. We're not stalkers, Reid. We're law enforcement officers doing our job. Too bad your dream man is a suspect. This would be a great way to learn all about him and help you date the guy. Well, after last night I just figured he was a funny, smart guy who loves Christmas and is a great cook. Oh, he cooked for you, did he? No, I just figure he's great at it. But now we know Mr. Right's a diamond thief. Well the FBI said they could never prove his involvement. I appreciate it partner, but the only thing worse than my inability to flirt with a cute guy is my inability to find a good one. Let's be real here. I'm never going to go on a date with this man. (phone rings) Bennett. (Carson) Hi. Is this Mackenzie? Speaking. Who is this please? This is Carson. We met outside the coffee shop last night. You fell, I caught you. Hello Mackenzie. Are you still there? Yes, yes I am still here. So nice of you to call. I hope you don't mind, but after you left I asked around and your friend who owns the coffee shop gave me your number. He did! Great. I hope that was cool? Sure Carson, that's totally cool. What else did my friend tell you about me? Oh, not much else. He had to grab another friend of yours who was hitting on one of the baristas. Seems about right. I swear, I'm not some stalker. It's not like I know where you live or anything. Hahaha. Listen, Mackenzie. I know it's weird, me calling you like this. But I really thought we had a connection last night. Me too. It was, ah... Serendipitous. It was. I'm sorry I had to jet like that. I know this is going to sound out of left field, but... is there any chance you'd go out with me? (phone disconnects) (recording device turned off) (Carson V.O.) I know this is going to sound out of left field but... is there any chance you'd go out with me? And that's when I hung up. I didn't know what the protocol was here. So how long have you known the subject? I met him last night. Last night? At a singles' mixer her friend was throwing at a coffee shop. So you're single then, Detective. You could say that. Look, I'm sorry. I should have come to you as soon as I realized who this guy was. Yes, you should have. But we only talked for like a minute, not even. And Bennett realizes that she can't pursue anything with this person. I wouldn't be too sure about that. What? Detective Bennett, as flawed as her decision was not to tell us, has actually put herself in the unique position to help the investigation. How? Detective, I'm ordering you to go on a date with this man. Immediately. What? Aw man. This is crazy! Yeah, it is. -I mean, can she even do this? -Yes she can. Think of it like date boot camp, Bennett. I'll be guiding you every step of the way and by the time we put him in jail, just in time for Christmas, you'll have a black-belt in dating. You're loving this, aren't you? I always love a challenge. Alright, so how does this work? Well, when a man and a woman like each other very much... I'm serious! Think about it. You're going to have a team of people helping you, watching your every move. You can even wear an earpiece and I will talk you through everything. I'm not that bad at dating, am I? Really? I'm a grown woman. Yeah, what about Myles, huh? Why do you always gotta bring up Myles? Did his eyebrows ever grow back? Yes. I think they did. (door opening and closing) We've got a lot of work to do. Hello! You need festive Christmas mugs. Hi? Oh! Okay. Let's see. What can we do? Umm... Mom, Mom! This is so bizarre. I don't need your help to date a guy. Really? How is that young man's mustache? Has it grown back yet? Eyebrows. It was his eyebrows. Really? I'm going to need therapy after this. Pumpkin, I know I'm your mother, but I'm also your Captain. And I'm sorry if I gave you the impression that this was a choice for you. Fine. But no more of this "Pumpkin" stuff while we're working, Captain. -Good. Let's get to work. - What's the plan? Well I have a gift from our FBI friend. A warrant for interior surveillance. Cameras inside his house, really? Listen, you've been ordered to date this guy, he's dangerous. I'd feel better if we had eyes on him. Really? This guy? I want eyes on you if you manage to get inside the house with him. That's crazy. Why would I ever be in there with him? Ah, well, when a man and a woman like each other very much... Mom! Listen, nobody expects you to get that far with this guy, especially anybody who knows your dating history. Reid! But just in case he invites you into his place for dinner, or to watch a movie. Fine. Anything else? Eyes and ears apparently. This warrant includes a wire tap for his home and cell. This should be fun. (phone ringing) (Carson)Hello? Hi, Carson? Yes. Hey, it's Bennett, ah I mean Mack, um Mackenzie. Ugh, sorry, it's ah, Mackenzie Bennett calling, my friends call me Mack. I'm glad you called, Mack. Ah yeah. Sorry about the phone call earlier, my, my cell's been acting up. No worries. We've all had bad cell days. Um, earlier you were mentioning a.. A date? Yup, that's the word I'm looking for. Um, I would very much like to date, I, I mean go on a date if the offer's still open, I mean I would if you want to if not I don't... Mackenzie. Would you like to have dinner with me tonight? Yes. Great, should I pick you up, or I can give you my address and you can stop by my place? Oh, it's okay, I know where... where... Where a good restaurant is. We could meet there? Sounds great. What's it called? What's it called? Oh, it's ah, the restaurant yeah, it's, um... Marco's. Hey I like Marco's. Well I hope you would if you're suggesting it. Yeah, it's ah, it's Italian, and they do this crazy Christmas-inspired menu every December. It's great. Love Italian. And cheesy holiday-themed menus. (laughs) Me too. And it's not far from you. How do you know where I live? I don't, I meant it's not far from where I met you, at Ken's coffee shop. I guess you live nearby? Maybe not? Anyway, Marco's is right down the street from there. I gotta go now. Gotta let you go, I mean. Okay, I'll see you at Marco's down the street from Ken's tonight at 7? Okay, sure, yup, gotta go. Bye. (call is disconnected) Wow. This might actually be harder than I thought. That was like a master class on how not to ask someone on a date. Don't worry Mack, we'll destroy these files as soon as the operation's over with. Don't be silly Detective Parks, you know we can't burn evidence. We'll have to keep them... And offer them up for scientific study. Yup. (big exhale and sigh) Everything looks clear. Carson should still be at work. (lock clicks open) What in Santa's workshop is this? (laughs) Joy to the world! What? What do you guys see? You'll have to see this for yourself Captain. I want cameras in the living room, the hallway, the kitchen and the bedroom. Isn't this the most incredible thing you've ever seen? Kind of weird, for a single guy, isn't it? No, it's sweet. I mean, how could a guy with this much Christmas spirit be a criminal? I'm not sure the two are mutually exclusive. But I vote that it's weird and doesn't work in his favor. Oh, you're just a killjoy. You know, you're worse than that Special Agent lady. (Captain on radio) Why don't you two geniuses get to work? There, it should be on. Huh! Holly Christmas kitchen! (tiny bells ringing) Okay. All powered up. Mack? Mack! We use to have these exact same ornaments when I was a kid. You good Bennett? Yeah. Be careful. Don't fall for this guy. What? No? What are you talking about? He's the bad guy. I can't wait to throw the cuffs on him. Uh huh. I'm good Reid. Just watching your back. (door opens and closes) This is so not a good idea. Don't worry, Bennett. We'll figure this out. Are those overalls? Over 25 years in law enforcement and this may be my greatest challenge. When I came to work today I didn't know I'd be ordered out on a date. Well, you'd better shake your reindeer tail, because it's less than two hours until your date. Shoot. Where did the time go? (phone buzzes) I don't know. But you gotta figure out another outfit otherwise this operation's over before it gets started. It's not that bad, is it? (hangs up phone) Jessica's outside. You. In that car. Now. - Jessica's here? - She has her orders. And I need you at the restaurant before the subject arrives. Make sure you keep eyes on her. You got it, Captain. Hustle people! This date is going to need extra effort. Oh, for Santa's sake! No! Uh, uh, back, please. Hey, this is... nice. Yeah. Do a little turn. No. Honey, your entire butt is out. Really? Okay, let's try again. Let's start over. ♪ high energy music ♪ Okay. Nothing's working. Ken! -Yo. -Help! Ken. Fast. Which one? Which what? Which one? Oh, which top? For my date. Now. Oh, ah... White shirt - classic, clean lines. Love it. But it's not a court appearance, Detective. So... No. Oh! Where do you wear that one? Sunday school? What are you, twelve? So that's a 'no?' That is a 'no' seven days a week. Oh oh oh oh! Please! Leave something to the imagination. Oh, it shrunk. But it stretches. That's another 'no.' Really? I've always liked it. 'Always?' What? Since the late '90s? Whoa! Finally. Tell me that fits you. Hands up, lady. Oh. No. That's the head opening. Keep your hand there, don't move. It fits! It fits! Okay! Yes! Yay! We have a winner. Now go get your jacket, the black one that I gave you for your birthday. Oh, I love that jacket. (Ken) Oh thank you! Come on Mack. (text notification ringing) He just entered the restaurant. You got your shoes on? Maybe if I didn't have to check my phone I'd be able to get dressed quicker. Excuse me. You dropped this. Nice. Nice! Okay, and... ready. Okay, okay, okay. Purse. Brush. Wallet. Lipstick. Okay, break a leg. I need coffee. Bye bye. Oh hey, can I get you anything? -I'm good. Thank you. -Okay just let me know. -It's about time! -Enough with the texts already. You think I just roll out of bed looking like this? How do I look? Better than expected. But you should get the approval of the Captain first. How do I look? (Captain Bennett) Mackenzie, you look beautiful. Thanks Mom. Parks? Ah, right. Would you do me a favor and wear this tonight. It would mean a lot to me. Mom, it's beautiful. Is it a family heirloom? It's department issue. There's a camera in the locket. Parks and I need to have eyes on you all night. Oh. And one more thing. It's Captain. Let's go get this guy. Copy that, Captain. Look, Carson's in there, he's been waiting for a while. -You ready? -Ready. Wait! Wait. Put this in. We'll both be in your ear. Okay, you really need to hurry. You got this! (indistinct chatter) Hi! How's your connection, Captain? Can you see clearly? Oh yeah. This oughta be interesting. You look beautiful. Thank you. You look quite spiffy yourself. -Sorry I'm late. -No, no need to apologize. I love this place. Yeah, lots of Christmas spirit. Like I said, I come here every year. Well, I hope you don't mind, but I took the liberty of ordering some Cabernet and some cheesy bread sticks. Moi, they are so good! You're doing great, Mack. Get him to talk about his ex-wife. Maybe it will lead us to the diamonds. Good call. So Carson, tell me a little about yourself. Ever been married? Kids? You're not still married, are you? Ah... Okay good, but in the future let's go one question at a time. (chuckles) No kids and no current wife. No "current" one? Ah, ex. (Captain) Good. Keep him talking. Ask him what happened. What happened? I mean, if you don't mind me asking? I never could figure that one out fully but I have an idea, a theory, nothing concrete, though. (Mack) Was she cheating? Have you tried the cookies, Detective Parks? Oh! Oh yeah. Hmmm. (electronic blip sound) So fresh! Captain, you have outdone yourself. Do you have any napkins, Captain? Yeah, of course, I'll have the SWAT team just fly some in. (chuckles) Do you think the ex-wife was cheating? Was she cheating? (Captain) Why did she ask about cheating? The cookies are on the button. Ah, we didn't mean to ask that. We didn't mean to ask that. We? Sorry, I mean me. I didn't mean to ask that. (Captain) The cookies were on the button. Sorry. -Sorry. -What? Sorry, I shouldn't be asking such personal questions, especially on a first date. No, it's, it's, Mack. It's okay. Look, I'm a big boy. Um. Was she cheating on me? I don't know. It's possible. To be honest, I wouldn't put anything past her, so. What happened then? She lied to me. I'm sorry. It's okay. Better I found out when I did. We were only married for a short period of time anyway. My friends really helped me get through that time. Actually it was my friends who encouraged me to go to the singles' night at the coffee shop. Well now I really like your buddies. Yeah, honestly, they're a great bunch of guys. You have friends like that? Yeah, um, Jessica and Ken from the coffee shop. And two others in particular. Good buddies, huh? They've always got my back. You know, my friends reminded me that life's short. You got to make the most of it, take chances. It's amazing how fast time can fly. Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it. Did you just quote Ferris Bueller to me? -Wow, I'm impressed. -You should be. What's going on here Parks? He just quoted an 80's movie and your daughter picked up on it. I thought it was my connection. (Reid) No ma'am. Good Christmas, they're meant for each other. I can't wait to tell Bunchy. Thanks again for dinner, and, um, lunch tomorrow. My pleasure. I'm just glad we had a chance to talk, you know. It's not everyday you find someone as weird as you are. Wow, look at that. I have the same figures at home. I used to have the whole set as a kid. Actually, I still have them. Well, all except for Mrs. Claus, but I lost that one. Really? Mrs. Claus is really hard to find. (loud banging from van) -Did you hear something? -No. Really, something made a noise from inside this van. It's a work van. I'm sure we just knocked a wrench or something off a shelf back there when you leaned in for a kiss. Speaking of that kiss. (intake of breath) I'm moving a little too fast. I get it. Thank you. Well I'm up here, but where's your car? I'll walk you to it. Ah, that's okay. I... I'm going to go say hi to Ken. You sure? Yeah, maybe grab a free coffee and talk about you behind your back. Smart, beautiful, you like 80's movies, and you have a hook up for free coffee. I like where this is heading. Well, say hi to Ken for me, and uh, try to make me sound good. You know like, charismatic and stuff. You got it. Good night Mackenzie. I'll call you tomorrow? Can't wait. (door opens) Really? (Captain Bennett)Parks did it. (door slams shut) Oh! Hello! (Mack) Coffee, yes. Good man. Cream or milk? Cream. And sugar! Hmm. (Mack) Everything bagel? Really? We can work around it. Okay. Crunchy peanut butter. My man! Mack. Morning sleepy head. Anything to report? You snore like a freight train. Anything on our boy? He got up half hour ago, took a shower. Probably leave for work soon. Anything else? -I made coffee. -Ah, you are the best. But I drank it all. I hate you. -Blah! -Blah! You've been up for a while, I can take over if you want to get some shut eye. No, it's okay. Why don't, ah, go make some more coffee, or go grab some? -You sure? -Yup. You seem pretty focused on that window. Just doing my job. So what exactly is our boy doing? Don't worry about it. Let me see. Oh Mack. Just checking out his Christmas decorations, huh? Yeah. They're really pretty. (computer notification sound) That's your computer. Are you gonna get it? (computer notification sound) Good morning Detectives. Morning Captain, Agent Robertson. Anything to report? Carson's just getting ready to leave his place now. Looks like he's going to work. You mean the "subject," Detective Bennett. Yes ma'am. I filled Special Agent Robertson in on the date last night. (Robertson) Oh, yes, thrilling stuff. Christmas wine and bread sticks. They were delicious. I go to that restaurant every year for that meal. Do I look like I care, detective? Actually, I can't tell. Regardless, our warrant won't allow us access to his workplace. I need more information on the ex-wife, and anything you can get on those diamonds. Yes, ma'am. Ask him out on another date. Soon. Today if possible and get me something I can work with. I'll try my best. If you can't Miss Bennett, I will pull you two from the case and find detectives who can. Do I make myself clear? Yes ma'am. (off beep) She's pleasant. She doesn't have to be. She's in charge of the operation. -I know, it's just... -It's just what? Does he really seem like a criminal? Listen, if we don't get you on another date with him ASAP that FBI agent is going to find him a new girlfriend. I know! Should I do lunch? Nah, lunch dates are for friends. Good call. Coffee? Coffee! (Reid) And we know the perfect place. Now wait, is he like a murderer or something? No! It was stolen diamonds. So he stole a whack of diamonds? Or his ex-wife did. A diamond encrusted reindeer and then she skipped town. And we still don't know if he's involved yet. -Wow. That's crazy. -I know, right? (Reid on earpiece) Alright Mack, he's coming. Okay, he's here. Remember, you cannot let him know I'm a cop. Don't worry about me, remember that summer I did Shakespeare in the park? I got this. -Wait, what? -What? -No! -No what? -Hey Ken! -Hey! Hi hi hi! Nice to see you again. Mack, you as well. Yes, lovely to see you too. Again. (laughs) Carson, can Ken here get you something? Just a coffee, please. Black. Okay! Coffee for the lovely man. (they both laugh) That's a hint of an accent, isn't it? No, he's just coming down with a cold. (Ken clears his throat) He really should be at home resting, but since he's here maybe he can get that cup of coffee? Uh huh. He seems pretty fun. Did you tell him all about our date last night? Remember Mack, you told him you were going to the coffee shop last night after the date. Yes, last night I came here after our date and told my friends all about you. That's right. Wish I could have been a fly on the wall for that conversation. Well you came out looking great. I told them you were charming, sweet and funny. So basically you just lied through your teeth. (they both laugh) Here you go. Wow! That looks interesting. Si Senor. (coughs) This is our famous Iced Christmas Snowflake Peppermint Mochaccino. Thanks. This looks and smells amazing. What do I owe you? Don't worry, he'll put it on my tab. There you go. So how long have you known Mack? Ah... we met, ah, at self defense class. Right? That's right. Sounds fun. Yeah, it was fun for me and you know, Mack was brushing up on her skills from the academy. Academy, what academy? -Ah space... -Space academy! Ah yeah. I wanted to go to space academy but I ended up spending the summer working at my Uncle's T-shirt printing company. Space academy! What? You wanted to be an astronaut? Yup, astronaut. An astronaut? That is a believable cover Mack. But remember Ken, I never ended going to the academy. Yeah, I remember. No academy. Yeah. I got to go. Hey, can I ask you something? Yeah? Am I crazy, or did last night just go really well? You're not crazy. Last night was a great date. Detective, remember you're on a stakeout, not a date. Right. So last night my friends were asking more about why your wife left you. Because you seem like... such a great guy. Well, thanks for the vote of confidence. But... I wasn't always that good. Really? Bad boy? No nothing serious. Just a few things as a juvenile. I had friends who stole things. Radios, jewelry. I didn't steal anything myself personally, but I knew guys who did, and I knew guys who wanted to buy stolen things. So you fenced stolen property for high school buddies to make a few bucks. Long, long time ago. Did your ex-wife like that about you? Maybe a little too much. Now it's your turn. Ever married? Nope. I find that incredible. I mean someone as amazing as you has never been married. Well my friends would say I'm horrible at dating. I'm always telling people how I feel about them and putting my foot in my mouth. I get it from my mother. Anything you want to say, Detective Parks? (pretend cough) No ma'am. Didn't think so. Oh no. What is it? He a friend of yours? Hardly. Okay. Then why is he trying to get your attention? He was a, he was an acquaintance of my ex- wife's. Get a shot of that man's face. Do you want me to run it through our database? No need. (Captain) On your toes Mack. That guy is David Sommers, a well known safe-cracker in the business. Carson. Dave. Nice to see you. I doubt that. You're not Bethany. No, I'm Mackenzie. What brings you here, Dave? Ah, I was just here to see an old friend. I mean what brings you here to this neck of the woods. Oh. Work. I'm here for work. Maybe you should get back to that then. Is that any way to talk to an old friend? David, we were never friends. Yeah. You're right. I was always better friends with your ex-wife. Hey, is she in town, by chance? I wouldn't know. Now if you wouldn't mind, I'm in the middle of something. Yeah, I see that. Look, I don't know this Bethany, but she's the ex. We're on a date. Maybe it's time you left. (Captain Bennett)Get in there Parks! You heard the lady. She asked you to politely leave. Now do I have to ask you to leave, not-so-politely? Because I don't remember that working out so well for you the last time. I'm kinda liking this not-so-polite option. Can I get in on that? Like I said, just here to say hi to an old friend. See you soon. So sorry about that. Oh, it's totally okay. You were kind of tough back there. So were you. Listen Mackenzie, I gotta go. Are you sure? Yeah, uh, I should get back to work. Just say thanks and goodbye to Ken. I'll call you... What was that all about? I don't know. He wasn't big time by any means, but he was a safe-cracker, that part I remember. Which would explain why Carson knows him. Okay, we don't know anything for sure. It could all still be his ex-wife. It's possible, but this definitely does not make him look good. Also, he said he was going back to work but we tailed him back to his house, in the middle of the day. Mack, I know you like him, and maybe in another time and another place something could happen. But I think Special Agent Robertson's right. I think you need to separate yourself on a personal level. (computer pings) Great job team. This David Sommers character is exactly the type of information we're looking for. Thank you Special Agent Robertson. Any other news to report? We followed the subject back to his house. And we picked up a call from the wire tap where Carson... I mean the subject called into work sick for the rest of the day. Good stuff, we have him scrambling. We still don't know if he was in on the diamond heist. Ma'am. Detective Bennett. He just ran into a person his ex-wife used to work with. If this Dave guy used to help her break into safes, it would only make sense that Carson would've met him at some point. You're getting attached to this Carson, I get it. But you need to be careful. I just want to make sure we keep an open mind. Well like I said, he's scrambling and if we keep the pressure on, he'll crack. -But... -But nothing Detective Bennett. I'm ordering you to go on another date with him as soon as possible. Ah, but Special Agent Robertson. What's the rush? This Carson could actually be dangerous. Detective Bennett, do you wish to step away from this operation? No ma'am. I didn't think so. Now go on another date with him. Fast. (beep as computer is turned off) Okay, well I'm going back to the station. Call me if this guy does anything. -Yes ma'am. -Yes ma'am. Be honest Reid. Am I crazy here or does he just not seem like a criminal? I don't know partner, they come in all shapes and sizes. Usually not this good looking but... Ahhhhh. There's gotta be something here we're missing. (computer keys clicking) Looks like your boy's up to something. What? He's about to make a phone call. This late at night? To who? (phone ringing) You. Hello. (Carson) Oh, hey Mackenzie, it's Carson. Sorry to call so late. I thought I'd get your voicemail. That's okay. What's up? I just wanted to apologize again for leaving so abruptly today. Don't sweat it. No, it was rude of me. It's just seeing that guy David... It just brought up a lot of bad memories, you know. Yeah, I can imagine. But like I said we're cool. Unless you feel like making it up to me. I would love to. Great. Mackenzie. Yeah. Would you go out with me? Meh, I'll think about it. Of course, I thought you'd never ask. Okay. Tomorrow night. My place. Um, your place? I'll cook you dinner. Uh - sure, that sounds nice. Let me give you the address. It's 118 North Street. It's right by the old post office, you know where that is? I think I'll be able to find it. Great, tomorrow at eight. Great. (beep as call is disconnected) Well, this should be fun. Aw man. So you really are pretty crazy about Christmas, aren't you? Guilty. It's nice to find another adult who loves Christmas as much as I do. Actually, I went to my storage unit once you accepted my dinner invitation so I could grab a few more decorations. I always save these ones for last. Wow, you have a storage unit for your decorations. I'm impressed. Well I needed one for the move, and yeah, a lot of it is filled with Santa Clauses, Christmas trees, Snow Men, Reindeer. -Really? -Yeah. Yeah, Christmas just brings back such great memories from when I was a kid. I love it. And these really are beautiful ornaments. Actually, this one right here is pretty important to me. Why is that? When I was about nine or ten my mom, she bought me this "paint your own Christmas ornament kit". And she helped me paint this one. It's beautiful. No, it's not. But I put it up every year to remember her. Your mother passed away? Yeah, in my junior year. It was a car accident. I'm sorry. That's when I started to get into trouble. But that's behind me now. Here's to moving forward. To moving forward. (kitchen timer goes off) -I should take a look at that. -Uh huh. Wait here. Mack. I hate to break up this party, but you've got to speed things along. How did your ex-wife ever let you go? Maybe I'm a horrible cook. That's not it. I can tell by your empty plate. No no no no. Don't let him avoid the conversation. Keep pressing. But seriously, I want to know. Bethany was a firecracker. A firecracker? She was exciting to be around and she liked to be around me, at first. But... But I was trying to move away from a certain life, and she was running toward that life as fast as she could. The criminal stuff. That guy from the coffee shop yesterday. He and other people use to hang around with Bethany a lot. She was smart, too smart sometimes. Okay. She'd tell them how to steal things. At first just here and there, for the fun of it. She'd tell them how to do things without getting caught. Did she get in trouble? She convinced the guys that they should try for one big score, you know the kind you can retire on. Sure. They robbed a diamond buyer last Christmas. They stole this diamond encrusted reindeer. One or two of the guys got caught. David obviously didn't. And your ex-wife? She just left. When things got hot, she didn't call or write. She just walked away from me without even saying goodbye. I'm so sorry Carson. You know I ah, I never really realized how deep she had gotten into that life. I really didn't know her at all. Thanks for sharing that with me. Well, you're the first woman I've told. Actually you're the first person I've gone out on a date with since she left me. Really? The first? Well at the risk of sounding cheesy, I, I just didn't think I'd be able to trust anyone else until I met you. Oh, stop it. No, seriously. A woman as beautiful as you, who loves Christmas and my cooking. (phone ringing) I should answer that. Excuse me. It's kind of late for a phone call, guys. Who is it? We're not sure Mack. Hang on. What's going on? (Captain Bennett) The wire tap's not picking up the call for some reason. Is the gear malfunctioning? (Reid) No, the gear is fine. We need to hear what's happening on that call. (door closes) Sorry, didn't mean to scare you. Oh, that's okay. It's a little late for a phone call. Is everything okay? It was Bethany. Bethany? What did she want? Oh, you know the usual, hey how are you, happy holidays, how's the family, your girlfriend's a cop. Brian! Have backup on standby to go in and hold for my signal. That's crazy, Carson. Don't! Because Bethany is a lot of things, but she's always right on the money about this stuff. Ah, no, Carson, she's messing with you. I'm not a cop... Please don't, don't lie to me Mackenzie! Okay, um... I'm a cop. A detective actually. We've been watching you for a few days. Why? This doesn't make any sense. The FBI asked us to do a stakeout. They think that you helped your ex-wife steal the diamond reindeer and that you still have it. What? The diamonds? The diamonds? But Bethany took the diamonds when she left me. Well they think you still have it. But when we met, outside that coffee shop, how did you... It wasn't planned. We actually met that night. And it really was serendipitous. Oh man. And when they found out that we met the night before... Oh please. Please! They ordered me to go on a date with you. But I wanted to. I really liked you. And I still really like you. They ordered you? I'm so sorry. Can you please just give me a chance. Mackenzie, I want you to get out of my house. Carson please. And I never want to see you again! (door opens and closes) Stand down Brian. She's out of the house, safe. (door closes) I'm sorry. (Mack is sobbing) Was that really that difficult? Was it? Really? A police officer! You went and told the man you were a police officer! There goes all our dates! There goes all our information. Do you guys have nothing to say for yourselves? ♪ sad piano music ♪ (sounds of electronic equipment being shut down) (suitcase closes) ♪ sad guitar music ♪ ♪ sad guitar music ♪ Still nothing from him, huh? Can you blame him? Not really. What I did was horrible. And even worse, I did it to a really nice guy who didn't deserve it. How's the FBI lady? Oh, she's super ticked. And your partner? My mother put Reid and I on administrative leave. (Ken) Oh. Do you still get paid? Yeah. Oh, it's like a paid vacation? Sure doesn't feel like a vacation. I haven't slept in days. Well you do look like crap. (they both laugh) (Ken) Why don't you go get some rest? It's Christmas Eve, I almost got fired, I hurt a guy I was falling for, and now I'll never find anybody. I don't think I can sleep. Don't worry, I'll set you up with someone. I appreciate it, but it's a little too soon. So, you're closed Christmas Ken? Thank goodness, yeah. But I'll come back anytime to make you coffee. -Thanks for the ice cream. -Sure. Mowah! (Reid) Don't worry, we'll be back on the job in the new year. Your mom just had to put us on leave for the optics. Yeah, I get it. I know it's hard. Carson seemed like a nice guy but, try to forget about him. Easier said than done. Administrative leave isn't that bad. It's like a paid vacation. So I've heard. (dogs barking outside) No way. Is everything alright? Mack, what's going on? (fingers snapping) Well done, coffee girl. Isn't that sweet? Running to rescue your new boyfriend? We're just dating. It's kinda casual. Ahhh. Actually, to hear Carson's point of view, it isn't even that right now. Typical new relationship bumps. He said you were feisty. He actually likes you a lot. Well and he hates you too. Listen, I'm a cop. You don't want to do this. Just let me call an ambulance. Why would I do that? (footsteps approaching) Because Special Agent Robertson from the FBI just walked in behind you. That special agent? That's my partner. Agent Robertson? She's not an FBI agent, that's Bethany. Oh don't look so shocked detective. David here is a great safe cracker, but he's also one of the best document forgers I have ever met. Mack, run, try to get out of here. Your mom, all it took was a phone call from the "FBI". A few forged documents and that woman was so eager to work with me. I swear she would have fetched my coffee if I'd asked. Watch what you're saying lady. Oh, don't worry. I'm only here for my diamond reindeer. Then I'll leave you, your mom and pretty boy here alone forever. I don't have your diamond reindeer Bethany. I never did. You've had it all along darling. You just didn't know it. What? You see, when the heist went south, I knew I had to lay low for a while, and I didn't want it on me, just in case I got caught. So you hid it somewhere until things cooled down. Exactly. But Carson just moved here. Imagine my surprise when I went to our old house and found a lovely Korean couple living there. You weren't very hard to track down. But I still couldn't find that one special object that I hid the reindeer inside of. For a minute, I actually thought he might have found it. So you figured you'd get us to do your dirty work. She does catch on quick. So where is it then? Inside the one thing I knew he'd never throw away. Little Carson made this for his mommy before she died. (smashing sound) So Carson never had anything to do with the robbery? Carson? Involved in the diamond heist? Ha ha ha. He's an idiot. The minute he found out, he made an anonymous call to the authorities. That's what spoiled our getaway. Merry Christmas to us. (Carson) What are you doing Bethany? Just finishing some unfinished business. What's your plan? Well, I was thinking of... Killing the three of you, making it look like you all killed each other. And find a beach somewhere and no one would be the wiser. Well, thank you for finding my reindeer for me. I appreciate it, but they're playing my song, so I've gotta run. (Captain) I wouldn't do that if I were you. We have a real good view of this house, so trust me when I say, you're surrounded. (gun clatters to the floor) (Officer) Hands up! Behind your back! Let's go. Let's go. How did you know I was here? A mother always knows. The back is clear. Well that, and your partner called me. (sirens in distance) Is he okay? I will be. (Captain) It sounds like the ambulance is almost here. (sirens in distance) I'm sorry Carson. It's broken. Not this. That. (sirens stop) It's for you. Here's the reindeer. Carson had nothing to do with it. (Reid) Would you look at that! I believe you Mackenzie. Well, I guess administrative leave is over. So would you put this beautiful reindeer into evidence? Yes Captain. (Paramedic) Ready? Let's get him on the gurney. Okay, let's go. Well, are you going to open it or what? (Carson V.O.) Mrs. Claus is really hard to find. Go be with him. Yeah, we got this. Hmm. -Good taste. -Oh yeah. I'd hang that up. -Hey! -Hey. I can't believe you found it for me. Well I knew it would mean a lot to you. You mean a lot to me. (Captain) Bennett! Mom! What? Don't forget Christmas dinner's tomorrow night. You have to bring a present for Bunchy. He likes liver treats. And hats. And maybe you could bring a date for once? Carson, would you like to go on a... (ambulance door closes)
