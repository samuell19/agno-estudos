Love and confess ... [birds singing] [male narrator] At the dawn of time, a profound discovery was made about our planet. [apes hooting] [grunts softly] [sniffing] It was boring. [mutters inquisitively] [sniffing] But boredom makes you think. [mutters inquisitively] And thinking gives you ideas. [grunts] And what was the first idea? I'll tell you what the first idea was. [Richard Strauss' "Thus Spoke Zarathustra" plays] "Must... kick... ball." [grunting] And so soccer was born. -[grunting] -Soccer made us compete. And soccer made us work together. [grunting] -More or less. -[grunts] [loud hooting] In other words, it made us... human. [grunting] Soccer isn't just a game. It's who we are. [whirring] [thunderclap, whooshing] [grunting] [panting] [grunting] [grunts, panting] [grunting] No! [thunderclap] [Matty] Dad. Dad. -Hey, Dad. -Huh? What? Wha-What's up? Mom wants you. Okay, I'm on my way. -[squeaking] -[woman] Jake! Is Matty out there with you? Honey, it's getting late. -[Jake] Hey, you heard your mother. -[gasps] Off to bed. Sorry, buddy. [sighs] [Jake] Matty seems sad. Has he said anything to you? [woman] He hasn't scored a goal all season. -He wants to quit the team. -[Jake] But he loves soccer. [woman] Yeah, but he thinks you're disappointed in him. [Jake chokes] But I'm not. I would never... [woman] Honey, I know that, but he doesn't. Go talk to him. -[Jake clears throat] Hey, Matty. -[video game chirps] -[gasps] Mmm. -You still awake, buddy? No, I'm asleep. -[Matty sighs] -Oh, good. Ooh, soccer. How does this thing work? [game beeps] -Uh-oh. -[male computer voice] You lose. -Oh, come on, Dad. -[male voice] Game over! I was just about to win the game and you lost? -[breathes heavily] -Ah, look who's awake. [sighs] Your mom told me you want to quit the team. -She did? -Married couples talk. -I'm sorry you had to find out this way. -[sighs] I want to tell you a little story. [sighs] Do I have a choice? [Jake] Uh... no. Now, it all began in a quiet little town not too far away from here. [Matty] Boring. [Jake] If you keep interrupting, it's just gonna take longer. -[Matty sighs] -Now, where-where was I? Oh, yes. Now, in this town, there was a cafÃ©. [overlapping chatter] Okay, so here we got a pretty tough one. What's a three-letter word for an annoying thing? -Hmm. "You." -[man] Oh. -Let me try that. -[grunts] -[man] Y-O... Hey! -[grunts] [man] Hey, what's the next one here? We got, uh... 27 across. -[music plays over headphones] -Oh. [scoffs] [Jake] And in this cafÃ©, there was a busboy named Jake. [Matty] Come on, Dad. Is this story about you? [Jake] No. Jake is a fairly common name. [man] Does anyone even work here? I'm hungry! Uh, yes, sir. I'll be right with you. [Jake] Every day was pretty much the same for Jake until he met her. [gasps] [boy munching] [girl sighs] [giggling] [grunts] [sighs] Hi. I'm Laura. Oh. [chuckles nervously] Hi. I'm Laura. -Mmm, mmm. -Uh, no, I mean, I'm Jake. [chuckles] Sundaes are great. I like strawberry. -And I like what you like. -Mmm. [singsongy] Uh, Laura's got a boyfriend! Laura's got a boy... -I can't feel my nose. -[Laura sighs] I can't feel my brain! She hit my nose into my brain! -[boy yelling] -Hey, do you want to see something cool? Of course I would. -Moose, can I take a break? -No. This is my foosball team, the Underdogs. Really? What do you mean, your team? Oh, I made all these players myself. So you did this? -They're amazing. What are their names? -[Jake] Oh. This one here is called Angry Mike. Don't ask. He sends it over to Rasta Chris, who passes it to the left-hand side to Igor, the Crushin' Russian. He looks out for a clear shot, but the Rippers cut him off! So he launches it back to the Mustachio twins-- Nino, [with fake Italian accent] who talk-a like this, and Gino, [high-pitched, fake accent] who talk-a like this. Gino passes it back to our team goalie, Bruno the Bouncer, -'cause nothing gets in. -[gasps] The ball flies over to Dr. Gregory Chan, DDS, soccer star by day, dentist by night, over to Jerry Curls, oh, and then to Ziggy, who hails from Berkeley, California -and meditates twice a day. -Yeah! And on to Rico, the self-proclaimed "most beautiful man in soccer." Last but not least, the team leader and my friend, Captain Skip, who scores more than anyone on the team. He shoots. Boom, he blasts it by the Rippers! -Goal! -Goal! [both whooping] [Laura laughs] [Jake] The Underdogs always win in the end! [Laura] Roar! -Yay! You're so good! -[door opening] [loud male laughter] How does he do that? [boy] It's like he and the ball are the same person. -Shut up. -[laughter] [Jake] And then there was Ace. His hobbies included picking on nerds, picking on the elderly and picking on Jake. He talked with a British accent, but I'm pretty sure he was from Orlando. Hey, Ace, pass it to me. Uh, I'm not sure I can kick it that far. [Jake grunts, laughter] Hey, Emo. [whooshing on game] Think fast. -[laughter] -Ugh. -And he's such a pest. -Hmm? Well, if it isn't the star foosball player. -Want to play? -No. Aw. You won't play? Aw. -Come on, kid. Play him. -[imitates chicken clucking] -Come on, Jake. -[boy] Ooh, he's scared. You can't let him intimidate you. This is it. It's your game to win. It's your table. This is your time. Ace is just a big bully. Take him down. He'll play! [sighs] [inhales sharply] -[sighs] -[Ace] Come on. Drop the ball. Let the domination begin! -Oh! -Goal! -Yeah. [Ace] Don't worry. It will be over soon. If you really want to help him, Laura, tell him to quit. I'll go slower this time to give you a chance. Yeah. Give him a chance. That's good, Ace. -Goal! -Yeah! -I try to lose, but I just can't. -[laughter] Come on. What are you waiting for? [boy] Nice. Like I was saying before, -the poor boy's nothing but a chicken. -Jake. [imitating chickens clucking] [sighs] [boy] Baby. -Aah. -Hey, chicken. You baby chicken. [boys imitating chickens clucking] [laughter] [boy imitating chicken clucking] [groans] [grunting] Hmm. Goal...! [laughing] Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah! Goal! Just shoot! Tied. And there it is! Goal...! No! We can stop now. No ties. Winners win. If you insist. [whooshing] [Laura] Come on! Come on, shoot! Shoot! -Yay! -Game over. -[laughs] Yay! -Yeah! [indistinct shouting and cheering] -[man] Jake! -No! -Boo-yah! -He was cheating me! I can't lose! I never lose! -Best two out of three. -[groans] No, three out of five! This can't happen! -[applause and cheering] -I demand -a rematch. -[grunting] -[cat yowls, glass breaking] -[grunting] Yeah! Jake! [whooping echoes] That table was rigged! Anyway, I play real soccer! I'll make this town... [grunts] ...like me -whether they like it or not. -[shouts] [crowd chanting] Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake! [Jake] When Ace left that night, everyone thought they were finally rid of him. For seven years things were peaceful in the town. The sun rose and set every day. -[whistling sound] -The birds still... uh, chirped. And as for Jake, he still won every game of foosball. Skip passes to Rico, who juggles the ball while smiling rakishly at a woman in the crowd. Come on, Rico. Get your head in the game. All right, I'm ready for an opponent. Who wants to play? Anyone? -I'll play with my eyes shut. -[fly buzzing] With one hand, if you want. How about no hands at all? Huh? [sputters] Hello, everyone. Hey, what's going on? Some big news. Look! I got into art school! I wanted to tell you first 'cause you're my best friend. -You what? -I know! I'll get to study graphic design, painting, computer animation. I don't know what I'll end up doing with my degree or where I'll do it, but I do know that there's a whole world outside of this little town, Jake. I mean, maybe I'll come back here someday, maybe I won't, but at least if I do, I know it'll be my choice. In the meantime, I get to see new places and meet new people, and.... Jake? I'm... [clears throat] I'm very happy for you. You don't seem happy. Me? No, no, I'm good. I'll be just fine. 'Cause I'll be here. I'll be here, doin' what I do, which is nothing at the moment. [chuckles awkwardly] But, you know, Laura, there's something I've got to tell you. I-I've been meaning to do this for a long time. Uh, but just... I haven't been able to say it, uh, before, so I guess I'll try to say it right now. Um... [clears throat] I... [horns honking in distance] -[helicopter blades whirring] -Hmm? What's that? [indistinct chatter] [gasping] [woman] Is that One Direction? [man] No, it's Danny DeVito. [man 2] No, that's a hobbit. [grunts] [murmuring] [chuckles softly] Good evening to all you inhabitants of this charming little town. Years ago, a boy lived here who was destined for greater things than any of you. So he became the greatest soccer star the world has ever known! But he's not just a great athlete. No, no, no. He's a great man. And I'm only saying that because he pays me. Seriously, I get ten percent of his income. I'm also paid to say this. He's the one with the foot of gold. He once scored a goal in a game he wasn't even playing in and once bent it around Beckham. What's not to adore? And so, without further ado, -look to the sky! -Huh? [rock music playing] Don't run! You'll miss his overproduced entrance! â™ª He's a man-made wonder â™ª â™ª Like a tornado â™ª â™ª Gonna blow you away now â™ª â™ª Faster than lightning â™ª -â™ª Without even trying â™ª -[grunts] â™ª Are you ready for this? â™ª â™ª He's a force of nature â™ª â™ª Finger of fate, yeah â™ª [agent] Ladies and peasants, please welcome the man who never loses, the two-time World Cup winner, the six-time International Soccer League MVP, and one-time winner of the Westminster Dog Show, he's your hometown hero, Ace Remacho! -[cheering and applause] -â™ª It's a whole new era â™ª â™ª For the solar system â™ª â™ª A brand-new religion â™ª â™ª Hope you're ready for this â™ª -â™ª He's a force of nature â™ª -[gasping] â™ª Finger of fate, yeah â™ª â™ª With the power of a hurricane â™ª â™ª Gotta deal with a force of nature â™ª [Ace] Thank you, my little town. Thanks a lot. I'm sure you're thinking, after all these years, "Ace must've forgotten about us." Well, yeah, I did. Totally forgot. But parachuting down, it all came back to me. -[chuckles, sighs] -[crowd] Aw. That's why, after years of superhuman success, I'm here to give back to my little town. Hey, why do you keep calling this place your little town? Well, because it is little. And this... -says it's mine. -[gasping] -[woman] What?! -[murmuring] What do you mean, yours? Let's see what the mayor has to say about this. Of course. Ask him. [crowd] Huh? See you in Rio, Ace! [whoops] [engine starts] -[gasping] -People love getting helicopters. You should've seen the smile on his face. Now, where was I? Oh, yeah. So say good-bye to the town you knew and hello to the future site of the largest stadium in the world! [announcer] Big Ace Arena! -There will be new shops, -Shops! -restaurants, and photo ops! -Restaurants! -[wolf whistle] -[announcer] Photo ops with Ace! How about a kiddie coaster? Whee! [announcer] Whee! All in celebration of the world's greatest, most important superstar, me! [announcer] Him! Ace...! [cheering and applause] But that stadium would ruin our town! [woman] Ace, will you marry me?! [man] Whoa. Those steps are sweet. -[gasps] -[Ace] Now, you, I didn't forget. And as for you... -[fly buzzing] -[inhales] -[gasping] -[squish] -Mmm. [chuckles] The renovation begins now, starting with the cafÃ©! [gasping] No! -[shouting] -Excuse me! Sorry. [gasping] No, you can't do this! [grunts] Cliff! Gordon! Everybody out! Emo, come on, man, we got to go! [shattering] No! [breathing heavily] No. No. No! [grunting] [humming] -[grunting] -[shouts] [grunting] So how you gonna beat me without your precious table? [whirring] Aah! No. [grunting] Aah! My table! No! [grunts] Take it away! [laughing] [shouts] Huh? [whirring] Ace, wait, you can't do this. Uh, are you flexing? This is your town. They're your people! My people? We'll see. You have a lot of history here. Stop! History is the problem, so I'm erasing it. [chuckling] -[chuckling] -Bring me that table. -I'll show him how losing feels. -Don't walk away from me! I'm still talking to you! Destroying a whole town because you lost a foosball game is stupid! And, anyway, no one even remembers that dumb game! Should we go to my place or yours? Huh? Excuse me! Sorry! -Mine it is! -No! [Jake] Laura! Laura! [whirring] [crying] [sniffles] [crying] [Jake] It was the worst day of Jake's life. But sometimes when we think all is lost, we find a little bit of magic in the most unexpected of places. [man] Goal...! [gasps] [mumbling nonsense] [gasps] [groans] [gasps] [sputters] [grunting] -[Jake crying] -[gasps] Jake, hello! [crying] [grunting] Hmm. [squeaking] -[grunts] -Laura. [groans] Hmm. Uh... [grunting] Jake! Down here! [grunting] Jake, look down! -Huh? -Down here! On your loafer! Hello! -Ah. -Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! -No need to faint! -Huh? I'm just a simple inanimate object that's come to life! Skipper? It can't be. Yeah, it can be, 'cause it's true. Can you believe it? You got magic tears, I guess. And you got me right in the face. If only you'd cried on me sooner. Think of everything that I can do for you. -Come on, get up. -Maybe my blood sugar's low. Or maybe I'm just dreaming this whole thing. -Oh, boy, this is bad. -[whirring] -[Skip] Yeah, it's not great. -[groans] But on the bright side, no work tomorrow. Yay. This is the worst day of my life. No, no, no. Jake, listen to me. This is an opportunity. We got to find more stuff for you to cry on, like a Barbie or a Malibu Barbie or-or both. -My life is over. -No! What we should do is get the team back together. -The team's gone! -[shouts] Laura's gone! Now I'm talking to you, -so I guess my mind is gone, too! -Aw, Jake, don't be like that. You're just going through the stages of grief. First there's depression, then denial, then something else. It doesn't matter! 'Cause I'm pretty sure the last stage is getting the team back together and saving the town! [chuckling] Right. Stop Ace. Are you crazy, too? Why am I asking? Of course you are. This whole thing is crazy. How is it even possible I'm sitting here arguing with a talking lump of lead?! Lump of lead-- seriously? -Yes. -Well, technically, you're a bunch of water held together by skin, but I'm not throwing your biology in your face, though I should. Now, you listen to me. Don't just sit here feeling sorry for yourself. We're the Underdogs, and we don't quit. We're at our best when things look the worst. So, Ace shows up, destroys our table, embarrasses you and then laughs in your face... [imitates cackling] Are you gonna let him do that to you? No, it's just... -no, I... -What? Do it for Laura. What would I say to her? I'm like... [babbles] Yeah, with Laura, you're like... [babbles] [chuckles] Yeah, yeah. -Not good. -[sighs] So, you're not so smooth with Laura, but when it comes to Ace, I think you know what to do. -Beat him again? -With the team! -That's right! -Where are they? Well, they're... Oh... No idea. Well, that's a problem in an otherwise good plan, so how are we gonna solve it? If you were Ace, what would you do with a bunch of little foosball players that you blame for ruining your life? Okay, if I were Ace... what would I do? I have no idea. If you recall, I came to life, like, four seconds ago, so where do big people put broken stuff? I know-- they're at the dump! -At the dump? -The dump! -Let's take your car! -I don't have a car. -Then to the bus! -Yeah, come on. Actually, I don't think you can take the bus to the dump. [Skip] Fine, then we'll just Uber. They have water. And mints! Where did you learn to fly? YouTube. I also have watched a video of a cat playing the piano. I'll send you the link. Oh, paparazzi. Let's see how close we can go. [shrieks] Live at Ace's mansion... Run for your lives! [shrieking] [chuckles] Oh, how will we find them in this mess? This is crazy. Rico! Ziggy! [Jake] So Jake and Skip found their way to the dump. [Matty] Ugh. The dump? That's just gross. [Jake chuckles] Tell me about it. But you'd be surprised the lengths you'd go to for your friends. [grunting] [exhales] Whoa. The wonders of Planet Earth. I never imagined it would be so beautiful. Ooh. [chuckling] Uh... -[squeaks] -Oh! Rico! Wake up, dude! Things are not chill! Aah! Help! Whoa! Slow down, Mr. Rat! We're all on this journey of life to-ge-ther! Aah! -Aah! -[Rico whoops] [squeaking] Aah! Hey! Hey, look, Ziggy-- Rico can surf. I'm freaking out! [screaming] [Rico whooping] Oh! [moans] [grunts softly] [all moaning] Ziggy! Rico! Aw, Skipper! -Rico almost died, but then he didn't. -Yes? Oh, man, I can't believe how good it is to see you. Uh-huh. Oh, my God, guys. Hey, we're alive! Aah! -[Ziggy] Yeah. -[Rico] As always, the sight of Rico -inspires a dance of joy. -[laughs] -Team song, go. Hey! -Team song, go, everyone. Hey! â™ª Hey, olÃ©, olÃ©, olÃ© OlÃ©, olÃ©, hey! â™ª -[Ziggy] Why is Jake so sleepy? -[Skip] Oh, he's having a rough day. I'll tell you about it later. -[Ziggy] He seems down in the dumps. -[Skip] Nice. Man, it feels so good to finally move. Yes, sir, I feel free! -Like I'm wearing boxers. Yeah. -Look at you. Of course you are looking at me. Everyone likes to look. Rico is the star. Come on, Rico. You may be an excellent player, but I'm the star of the team. Uh... Oh, sure, Skipper. Rico got confused. You are the star. [chuckles] Hey, let's humor the guy. He's gone loco. Uh, Rico, I can still hear you. You moved, like, four inches away. -[laughs] -[laughs mockingly] No, I'm serious. Sponsors come to Rico for everything, so if you think for one moment all those people who want me would prefer you, -then you're crazy. -Are you kidding? Is all you think about sponsors? Sometimes I wonder how you get that big head -into your jersey. -That's what beautiful women are for. The world does not revolve around you, even if your head is shaped like a planet. -[clears throat] At least Rico's hair isn't painted on. Bro, your hair is glued on. And while we're on the subject of hair, -Oh, keep dreaming. Rico's hair... -it was designed -to be aerodynamic and as a result, -...doesn't need dye. -it never gets in my face. -It is beautiful just the way it is. Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys. Please. [inhales] Breathe out. It's obvious to me that we should all pause -and meditate on how... -[groans] we're all made from the same mold. 'Kay? [inhales] Mmm... You know what? I think you're jealous. [imitates siren] We have a delusion alert coming from Rico's left. There's no such thing as a delusion alert. Please. -I've had as much as I can take of this. -It's obvious. -You cannot be serious. -You've always been jealous... -You know I'm the best player... -of having to be in the shadow -on this squad! -of my beautiful looks. -Of course you won't admit it. -Enough! This fighting doesn't help at all. We need to have a plan. Sensing some tension here. Let's share stories of pain. Me first. Sometimes, when I kick the ball, I cry inside, because it's like -I'm really kicking me. -Dumbest thing I've ever heard. -Rico doesn't comprehend. -Come on, Skip, man, -don't use angry words. -You know what? Hope I'm not interrupting boy band practice. It's you. What's with all the anger, dude? Where are my mates? Having a long talk with your barber. [all laughing] [low grunting] Not so tough without your team of goons, huh? I've played soccer moms tougher than you. -Don't talk about soccer moms. -Ooh! Those women are making a difference -in children's lives... -[squeaking] What's the matter? What's wrong with you-- -cat got your tongue? -Not a cat. -Rico thinks we should run away. -[gasps] Uh, maybe rats can't see you if you don't move, so, Rip, just stay right there. This is where Rico exits stage right. [shrieks] [all screaming, panting] Over there! [grunts] Come on, Ziggy! No! -[vehicle approaches] -Hey... Huh? Ooh, who's that? Oh, no. [groans softly] [Skip] Oh, Rico, I can't believe it! I never told him, but I think we were twins. -[both] Huh? -[Skip] Didn't you ever notice? We had exactly the same face, the same body. We're like the same person... except with different hair. Oh, Rico. Oh, my Rico. Skip, we all feel your pain, but Rico wouldn't want us to be sad. He'd want us to celebrate his life. I think, if you listen to the wind, you'll hear his voice. [Rico in distance] Hey, muchachos! [squealing, neighing] Ugh. The rat is not a horse. He's such a show-off. Whoa. [squeaks, neighs] Whoa, steady, Gordita. Good girl. [laughs] See? Rico triumphantly returns. [laughs] Finally. Now can we go? We've been sitting around, waiting for you while you play with your new best friend. Is he always like this? It's not his fault. He has a very elaborate backstory. -Whoa. -[squeaks, neighs] Are you guys still behind Rico? [all] Yup. [Rico clicks tongue] Rico spies with his little eye something that begins with... [gasps] The rest of the team! -Let me see. -Shh. [Ziggy gasps] That creepy guy's gonna steal it. We got to tell Jake. Whoa. -Hmm. Go on. -Yeah, boss? Just find that stupid table! Huh? Oh. [agent] First he says throw it out, -now he wants it. Huh? -[horn honks] Hey, what the... Learn to drive! Oh, no, I know how to drive. I just don't know how to stop! -[honking] -Whoa, whoa, -get out of my way! -Aah! -Aah! Whose house is this? I'll tell you whose, it's Jake's house! You guys see that? I'm taking care of "bidness" up in here. I don't condone violence, but that was pretty dope. Thanks, I just wish Laura could've seen my mad skills. -We found the table. Let's go. -Wait, are you guys riding a rat? [Rico] Gordita, away! No! He's got the table. Wh-What do we do? Everyone off. This is my moment. Rico to the rescue! [grunting] Aah! [yelling] [panting] [grunting] [exclaims] [yelling] Not the hair! Not the hair! No! Rico, no! No, I've lost him again. Come back. Come back! And you there-- where's your loyalty? Rico loved you and cared for you. -Bad Gordita. Bad. -[squeals] Look-- he left us a trail. Follow that fro! The trail runs cold. -Now what? -[children shrieking, cheering] [Rico] Go away. Rico said to tell you he's not here. -Rico, is that you? -No. Rico is gone. But he left you a message. He loves you very much. -[crying] -Would you get out here? -Stop hiding like a big baby. -[grunting] Don't! Look away, look away! -Look away! Why, why me?! -Grab him! -Why me? -Rico, come on. Pull yourself together. All my hair products will be useless to me now. We'll find you a nice hat to wear. I don't look so good in hats. I could take you to my barber, introduce you. Have you looked in a mirror lately? [indistinct conversations] -[Matty] So he found Rico? -[Jake] Yup. [Matty] And he was with Skip and Ziggy? [Jake] Both of them, and even Rip. [Matty] And the rest of the team? [Jake] Hold on, buddy, we're getting there. -I don't even know where to start. -Ooh! We're gonna have to split up. I'll search the rocket ride. -[grunts] -Wait, wait, wait-- I-I think I hear them. [man] Oh, man, this is gonna hurt bad. [Jake] Guys, look-- the shooting gallery. Didn't your parents tell you not to point things at people? -[shot] -[all] Whoa! No! That's my team! Don't shoot! Hey. It's Jake to the rescue! Jake! -Our shepherd has come at last! -Hey, hold it! Guys, we got five more! -[grunting] -[crying] No, no! Rico feels naked. Without curls, -Rico looks like a baked potato. -Rico, why don't you try to see this as an opportunity? Don't let your looks define you. Let go. Let that inner beauty out. [barker] Come on, kids. -Test your skill. -[gasps] [barker continues indistinctly] [sighs] â™ªâ™ª Hmm. â™ªâ™ª Hey! Hmm. [grunts] Mm-mm. [humming] [meditating] [giggling] Mmm! Ah. [gasps] Aah! [gasping] [announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, welcome to the Dancing Puppet Theatre! [cheering, laughter] So you think you can dance? Take a look at this little lady! [panting] [gasps] 'Stache! [panting] [grunting] No! [woman] You lost another balloon? This is why I won't let you have a puppy! [groans] 'Stache! Oh, what have they done to you? I am a hood ornament on the freight train of shame. I'll free you. Now, where's your brother? -Up above. -You mean your twin brother's in heaven? No. Literally. He's up there. [in distance] Buongiorno, Skip! I hear his voice. Give it a minute. [screaming] -Hey! -Mustachio, grab my hand! -This is not-a your best idea, Skip! -Nothing's gonna tear -this team apart! -[Gino screaming] [grunts] Stop screaming. We did it. We did-a nothing! Take a look-a down! Oh, my. [whimpering] What do we do now? We could always try-a screaming again. Mmm, not a bad idea. [screaming] â™ªâ™ª [children cheering] [cheering and applause] -[screaming] -[Skip] One, two, -three! [grunting] -[grunting] Again. -One, two... -[grunting] It's no use, boys. -Leave-a me here. -Don't-a talk-a crazy. I'm-a holding this whole thing-a together. -Without me, it go boom. -If you-a stay, I-a stay. Oh. So you're going to hold on to my tushie forever? [screaming] [Gino] This is fun. [whooping] [screaming, shouting] [brakes hiss] [shouting] [gasps] The table! â™ªâ™ª [grunts] Ta-da! Wow. Nothing says "I don't have an overinflated ego" like a giant statue of yourself. Right. Anyway, this one's a tribute to my shoulders, -where I carry the load. -Yep. -I can almost smell the load now. -Can you believe when I was a kid I couldn't even spell "art"? [chuckles] I've grown so much. Here's one of me throwing a Frisbee. You mean a discus? [laughing] The sculptor called it that, too. Some people don't know anything about sports. [groans] I had this one made because I've always wanted to watch myself sleep. It's the one thing I can't do. Don't you think I look like an angel? I find it quite moving. Look, goose bumps. And this one? No idea. Smelling my hand? [crickets chirping] [Nino] Eh, Gino, is this our table? [Gino gasps] It is, Nino! It's our table! -Skipper! -Huh? Bruno! [panting] What have they done to you? It's humiliatin'! They put me on Rip's team! Get me down! But that's crazy! And wrong! Help me, guys! -[Rip laughs] -You did this, you filthy snake! There you go again. Why are you always trying to make me -the bad guy? -Because that's just what you are, bro! -Never been your bro, mate. -Well, I've never been -your mate, bro! -Back off! The truth is, you're no better than me without Jake, -and you know it. -You leave him out of this! -[Rip growls] -Stop it! Do you guys hear yourselves? You're always at each other's throats, but you have much more in common than you think. -It is time for a little therapy. -[sighs] -Let's put this to rest once and for all. -Huh? -What? -Let's say something honest. -Okay, Skip, you start, huh? -Huh? [mumbling] Mm, I suppose... -Speak up now. -Well, he's... -And really feel it. -Fine. Jake's our coach, not yours! Good stuff. Now you, Rip. Well, why is he just your coach, hmm? -Can't he play with us as well? -[players mocking, scoffing] Oh, what? Shut up! I have feelings, too! Careful with Bo Peep. She's a delicate flower. -[laughter] -But, really, -who wouldn't love that face? -[laughter] [player] This is fun. Maybe next time I get to be Bo Peep, you know? [laughing] You know? Oh, you don't know. -[Rico clears throat] -Huh? -[Rico] Ladies and gentlemen, your attention, -please. -[Jake] Rico? Is that you? It's time for Rico to chase his dream of being an actor. My dream is to use your head as a soccer ball! Me, too! I'm gonna rip silly wig off and bit you! [Rico] Listen to you. This is why Rico is moving on. I have learned there is no jealousy in show business, only harmony and applause. Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap... [Skip] Rip, you're so right. Nobody gets how hard it is to be captain! Hey, at least your guys have names. A lot of mine -don't even have faces. Right? -Makes it even more impressive -that your guys actually listen to you. -[chuckles] -Thank you. -Seriously. I mean, that's the, uh, essence of leadership. Without us, the dummies would probably keep kicking it in their own goal. -[Skip and Rip laughing] -Mamma mia. Their own goal. We should totally tweet that. Whee! This is fun! No, no, no, no, no, it's not! Put me down! -Oops! -[grunts] [laughs] My dream's come true, and so can yours. I want to break this to you gently. I never, ever liked you, and I never will. You're a really terrible person. I don't follow. Why are you using such big words? Let me try to be as clear as I can. To me, you're just a bully. That makes even less sense. I had plans for our future. Whoa. Whoa. [crickets chirping] [yelling] [players yelling] Don't forget about Rico! I've come home, muchachos! Hey, is that Rico? I was beginning to think we'd never see you again! And here you are! Don't be silly. Rico will always be by the side of his brave team captain. At least until he lands a big role on Broadway. You know? You're a little delusional, but I love you. Hey, you guys ready to play a game? Hey, Jake! Give us a ball! We're all ready to play! Let's go! All right, guys, it's game time! [player] All right, let's do it! -Hey, put it there, man. -Nice. -[Skip] Do it! -Yeah. -Well, mm... -[player 2] I'm ready! What are we waiting for? -What do we do? -[Skip] Guys, the ball's not gonna come to you! You move to the ball! [growling] â™ª Love and happiness â™ª â™ª Kiss me alive, I must confess I'm feeling strong â™ª Oi! [grunts] â™ª I like to get my fingers â™ª â™ª Burned... â™ª -[indistinct shouting] -[grunts] [grunting] [shouts] [chuckles] Hey, Jake, did you see that play? -[indistinct chatter] -[player] You used your hand. [sighs] Are you still worried about Laura? Why don't you just leave me alone? How about you just get over it? We're here for you. Laura's gonna be fine. Really, Skip? And how would you know? She's leaving anyway. Who cares? Yeah, that'd be great if I wasn't in love. This isn't some game for me. I've got to find her. [sighs] Hmm. [Rip] Is he all right? What's wrong with him? Jake's team isn't whole without Laura. Dude, my heart feels like lead. I would cry, but I don't know how. Rico has a hole right in the middle of his chest. A big hole. I cannot think of clever pun but also feel sad. -Hmm, hmm. -Hey, look! It's the car from the dump! [Rip] It's Ace's agent. What's he doing out here? [Skip] Probably searching for us. Ace must have sent him. -We should tell Jake. -...nine more times, go find those players! Come on, boys. Jake! We just saw Ace's agent! He's still looking for us. There's got to be a way to get him to lead you to Laura. -We need a plan. -Jake, we're here for you. Tell us what we need to do. He's here. Shh. Now, this is what we call a collector's item. But I'm sure we can make a deal. Give me the screwdriver. â™ªâ™ª [exhales] [squeaking] [chuckling] I don't understand this fascination with toys. Why can't he just have a gambling problem like normal superstars? [squeaking] To Ace Land, and step on it! [Jake] He calls his house Ace Land? What a tool. -[tires screeching] -[gears grinding] [indistinct clamoring] [Skip] Jake, smile. Uh... [Skip] Wow, look at this place! Are we sure Laura wants to be rescued? -[Jake] She deserves better. -[Skip] Than this? [player] That house is awesome. -Ace, what are you doing? -Hmm. Thinking. Well, stop it. You'll hurt yourself. I got you a surprise! [grunts] Give me! Give me! Give me! These are what I've been waiting for. Huh? Where are the others? I, uh... What do I even pay you for? Get out! What's the matter with you? They're harmless toys. With me? These toys represent my only failure, which I'm now going to erase. [panting] No! No, no, no, no, no! Laura! Laura! Oh, no. Not again. I'm too late! No! [groaning] -We're here. -We couldn't have walked over? I need to increase my carbon footprint. Mm. [whooshing] -[rhythmic squeaking] -What is this? The future of sports science, Laura, genetic engineering. First, I had someone explain to me what that was, and then I had a brilliant idea. What if you combined animal DNA with sports equipment? [Laura] That's insane. Ah, that's what they said about Einstein. No, they didn't. They said he was really smart. Please don't talk when I'm talking. Anyway, I hired the best minds money could buy to bring it to life. -[bird squawking] -[laughs] I give you the pigeon mascots! Don't get too close. So, now I'm gonna try combining the foosball players... -with my shoes. -You've lost your mind. These little men were responsible for my only defeat. When I mix them with my shoes, I'll be completely unstoppable. What are you doing? No! -Please don't! Stop! -[groaning] [Ace laughing] Whoa. -What's he doin'? -Shh. -Using his head. -Oh. Something you should do every once in a while. Just watch him. It'll be good for you. -Hmm. -Right now he's in the zone, analyzing every angle. Hmm. 'Cause sometimes the most complicated problems -have the simplest solutions. -Hmm. [indistinct whispering] [Rip] He's figuring it out. Calculating and... We do not have the code to the keypad. I don't know what to do. [grunting] -Oh. -That's not exactly what I had in mind when I said, "Use your head." [indistinct, overlapping chatter] Wait. Stop! Just show me more inventions or animals or muscles, anything. -Show me around. -Sure. Underdogs! [grunting] Oorah! -[indistinct shouting] -Underdogs! [grunting] [Skip] A little late on that, Jake. Got any more bright ideas? -[mockingly] "Got any more bright ideas?" -Ooh. -[glass shattering] -Aah! Jake to the rescue! [choked groaning] -[gasps] Come on, Ace! Let him go! -[Ace chuckles] -Please! You're hurting him! -You leave her alone! -It's just his neck. -You bully! I love her, and she'll never love you! [Jake choking] Ooh. Hmm. [grunting] [for crunch] -Don't tell me you still like this loser. -[Jake groans] You're the loser! Hmm! -[Ace chuckles] -[muffled groaning] No. No! -[Ace grunts] -No! [groans] Over here, grab on! Oh. No, never mind! Let go! I will crush you! [groans] [whimpering] [Ace groaning] -Laura. Laura! -Huh? [groaning] -Whoa! -[groaning and panting] -[bird squawking] -[whimpering] Do not attack! Rico is friend to all creatures! -Come on! -[grunts] Let's go! [grunts] No! [yelling] [grunting and yelling] [slow-motion groaning] Wait for me, Laura! Oh. Laura! [grunts] [Ziggy] Hey, Skip, we're coming! [panting] [bird squawks] -Let's go! -[grunting] [Rico] Welcome aboard Air Rico! [bird squawks] Whoa. -I believe I can fly! -[alarm sounding] [metallic creaking and hissing] [bellowing rumble, high-pitched squeak] â™ª OlÃ©, olÃ©! â™ª Om. [sobbing] [sputtering] [laughing] Far out! [coughing] -[sirens blaring] -[woman] Tell us, Ace, are you all right? [Ace] I'm okay. I'm fine. Rest assured, I was able to save what was most important. -[woman] What's that? -Me. -[groans] -[Ace] I just want you all to know this in no way affects my plans to destroy the town. So no worries. That's still happening. -[indistinct chatter] -Are you all right? Fine. How about you? You okay? It was scary. [sighs] There's something terribly wrong with Ace. Like, oh, my gosh, he lost one foosball game to you, and the guy just can't let it go. Does that mean you don't like him? Of course I don't like him, Jake. You're so not getting the point, are you? The point is, he's destroying our town, and we just can't let him do that. There's only one person who's beaten Ace before, and that's you. You have to figure out a way to do it again. [Ace] I don't know if you've noticed, but I've increased my squat to about 880. Maybe I can. -[gasps] -[woman] The explosion...I hear this. Hold on! I beat you once. Everybody knows I've never lost at anything. Well, you did, and that's the truth. -[gasping] -I'm challenging you to a rematch. [people gasp and sigh, Laura chuckles] [indistinct chatter] Do you want a piece of me? Absolutely. Then I accept the challenge, but this time, I'm not messing around. You want to man up? Let's play real soccer. [laughing] [woman] Are you going to accept the challenge? But I'm not... Uh, well.... You always were a coward. -[woman] Is that true? -[man] Are you a coward? Fine. Let's do it. Wait a minute! If there's nothing at stake, let's at least make it interesting. If Jake wins, we get our town back from you. -There's something to play for. Hmm? -[woman] Oh. Winner gets... the town. [man] Sassy girl just challenged you, Ace. Hmm. [woman] Will you accept that challenge, Ace? [chuckles] With pleasure. -[helicopter whirring] -Oh, great. [Wagner's "Flight of the Valkyries" playing] [Jake] As the stadium was being built, Jake and Laura began to recruit a team, hopeful that with their homes at stake, the town would rise to the challenge. Oh, hi! We're forming a team, and we're here to recruit you. Yeah? Sure. Who we playing? -Ace's team. -[door slams shut] Uh... Oh. Hmm. [door squeaks open] You look like you have great reflexes. -I don't. -[Laura] That was really fast. [Skip] Boo! Ace's team! Muscles and good looks are overrated! Boo! You guys are goin' down! So, have you given any thought to what you're gonna do if they don't go down? â™ª Feels like I need an army â™ª -Ah! Mm. [laughs] -â™ª Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah... â™ª -Want to... play... -Soc... -...cer? -No! You mean you'll play? -Of course. -Yeah. -â™ª Now my intention is clear â™ª -Ace! Ace! Ace! Ace! -Ace! Ace! Ace! -[grunting] -[grunting] -â™ª What was out of reach â™ª â™ª Is now so near â™ª â™ª I need you, I do â™ª â™ª You know I really do I hope you need me, too â™ª â™ª I want you, I do You know I really do â™ª [whistle blows] -â™ª I hope you want me, too â™ª -[gasps] [panting, grunts] â™ª We should be on the same side â™ª â™ª So just come on over tonight â™ª â™ª 'Cause I need you â™ª -â™ª I do... â™ª -[Laura] Jake? -I found you a goalie! -Hi, Jake! Aah! Freddie, I hear you're the fastest guy around here. -Is that true? -Can I borrow your pen? Hmm? Ooh, sneaky. This man isn't going anywhere. He's in my custody. You know, you really have a body built for soccer. -Mmm. -â™ª I need you, I do â™ª â™ª You know I really do I hope you need me, too... â™ª I hope you don't take this wrong way, Jacob, but you haven't got a prayer. This is important, Father. I need a defender. Do you happen to own a pair of cleats? -â™ª So just come on over tonight... â™ª -[laughing] Ooh! I feel the wind beneath me vestments. I just don't understand how it is you found me. I live alone, I'm off the grid. I completely reject society and all human contact! But we're desperate. And if Ace wins, the town will be totally ruined. Then we'll have no choice but to move in here with you. What? What?! No! â™ª Oh-oh, oh, oh Oh, oh-oh, oh â™ª â™ª Oh-oh, oh, oh Oh, oh, oh... â™ª Now I've asked every guy in town, but we still need one more. What do you say? Ooh, ooh, ooh. How about my nana? I know a gentleman should never ask this, but, uh, what size jersey should I get for you? Hmm? â™ª Oh, oh, oh... â™ª A little to the left! No, to the left! Your other left! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Eh, close enough. There you are. Jake? [grunts] What's up? You ever been scared? I'm sure it's just me being all crazy. Real courage... [grunts] ...is when you're scared, and you keep fighting. [groans] I'm mostly scared that I just won't be good enough. You got to believe. It's what... Yeah, "believe." Easy for you to say. If we fail, it's all my fault. [Laura crying in distance] You're not doing it alone, Jake. [Laura crying] [crying] -Hey, what's wrong? -Nothing. This is nothing to cry over. Yes, it is. This whole thing is my fault, -and I'm scared for you. -Scared about what? How could I live with myself if you or anyone else gets hurt out there? I opened my big mouth and made a bet -you can't even win. -We'll be fine. You'll see. What happens if we lose everything, Jake? Where will everyone go to live? Hey, you just got to have faith. That's something you gave me a long time ago. I was terrified when I first played Ace, but your belief made me strong. Do you really believe we have a chance? I don't know if I'll be any good at soccer, but there's one thing I do know. That you and me... make a great team. [chuckles] -[feedback from speaker] -[agent on speaker] Hey, Louie. Test out the scoring cannon. That's the lights, you idiot. -[music starts playing] -That's the radio! I'll see you tomorrow. [agent] Did anyone ever read the manual to this place? â™ª Well, the morning tide fell softly â™ª â™ª Till the end of night â™ª â™ª For us â™ª [giggles] â™ª Yeah, no matter the score â™ª â™ª We'll belong on the shore â™ª So you gave that beautiful speech and she doesn't even give you a kiss? A hug was good enough. You're such a romantic. â™ª With love â™ª [humming a tune] [exclaims] [wild cheering] [announcer] Welcome to the first ever game in the most epic stadium in human history: Big Ace Arena! [announcer 2 chuckles] That's right. Built in only seven days by Extreme Stadium Makeover. Is it safe? I mean, come on, dawg, who cares? Let's play some soccer! -[indistinct chatter] -I tell you, working for stars can make you crazy. You know what he demanded this morning? A pet panda. I said, "Why?" He said, "Because everyone loves pandas and everyone loves me." -So now I got to call China. -Okay. Roll the sing-along. [male singer] â™ª Our eyes have seen the glory â™ª â™ª Of the legend known as Ace â™ª â™ª He was born here in our town â™ª â™ª Then dropped a stadium On our face â™ª â™ª If you think that you're a winner â™ª â™ª Wait till you see his trophy case â™ª â™ª He'll beat you every time â™ª â™ª Glory, glory, Ace Remacho... â™ª [announcer] And now, the coach, captain, and the man who needs no introduction, but because he's an egomaniac, we have to... Ace Remacho! [announcer 2] And there's referee Christofero Bamborini. [announcer] And now let's meet the Townies. [announcer 2] Uh, they're down there, below the belt. [announcer] Uh, Cliff "Clifford" Jackson. [announcer 2] Father Patrick Fitzpatrick, -aka Benjamin Button. -Well... [announcer] Freddie "Fingers" Finkis. [announcer 2] And Rufus "The Wrecking Ball" Peterson. [announcer] And that emo kid who never says anything. [announcer 2] Gordon "The Walrus" Reilly. [announcer] Who's fixing his dentures. Officer Russell "The Muscle" McFine. He'll take no prisoners. [announcer 2] And here's Richard... -[announcer] "Moose"... -[announcer 2] "Double Decker" Diesel. That's a big dude! [announcer] We don't know who this guy is, frankly, because he won't tell us, so we call him Stinky. [announcer 2] And here's, uh, well, they're only listing him as "Bob." [announcer] And there's your team captain, Jake Hoffer. [announcer 2] He looks scared! -[shutters clicking] -[cheering] What are you doing? No idea. But it's fun to do, isn't it? [growls deeply] [high-pitched growl] [whimper] [announcer] And it's game on. Stinky taps it to Jake, who passes it to Jackson. Jackson to... -Bob. -Hey! [announcer] Bob seems confused. Moose would like it. Moose has got it. To Reilly. Over here! [announcer] Now the priest would like the ball. -[grunts] -[Jake] I'm open! -Oh, come on! -What are you even doing? -Pass it! -Rico commands you to pass! Pass it now! [announcer] And there's the long pass to Jake. [announcer 2] Either he's strategizing or he needs a new pair of pants. And... [grunts] [announcer 2] Oh! Call the deli, 'cause he just had a dirt sandwich. [announcer] Ball's sent up to Bubaye. -[grunting] -Watch him toy with the defense. Oh, do you want to play with fire, Scarecrow? And what about that right leg? That's a cannon! -He sends it towards the goal. -I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it... -[whistle blows] -[cheering] He got it. [announcer] Goal...! [announcer 2] And Ace makes it one to nothing. His love life is about to be lit. Come on, everybody. Don't be discouraged, Rufus. Come on, we still have 89 and a half minutes to go. [announcer] Back to the action. Jake to Stinky. Stinky to Jackson. Sends it over to Fingers. Fingers is eyeing McFine. And then he... He's making a break for it! What... -Oh, what... - [groaning] [announcer] That's some fine police work, but not very good soccer. [announcer 2] They are not good at soccer. But they are good at looking pitiful. [laughs] [announcer] And Moose launches one. [announcer 2] Let's go to Jerry in the blimp. Jer, how does it look to you? [Jerry] It's heading right for us! The blimp is made of very fragile material! [screaming] -Oh... -Oh... -[explosion continuing] -[announcer 2] Jerry is on fire! [Jerry] I'm okay! [announcer 2] Folks, now, I knew this game would have fireworks, but not like that. It is a barbecue out there. [announcer] That is not funny. Uh, sorry, America. Now back to the action. Beautiful pass upfield. This is looking way too easy. Ace jukes McFine. And he hurdles two defenders with ease! [distorted] Oh... Time out, referee! -[whistle blows] -[announcer] Goal! -[cheering] Ace has done it again, making it two-nothing! Or is it two-nil? Oh, what a mistake by the goalie. Goal, yeah! Yeah. [announcer 2] And here's a fun fact about Ace. That coffin-shaped goatee is insured by Allstate. -It's kind of too easy. -It's a blowout, -no question about it. -Got to check my Instagram. -What, no more Facebook? -Slow down, Ace. What for? We're killing 'em. You're gonna lose the viewers if you don't make it seem competitive. Nobody's gonna watch. Don't forget to give 'em a show. Thanks for the advice, but I think I'll win now. Of course you're gonna win it, Ace. You just got to keep it close. But only for a while. â™ªâ™ª [grunting, moaning] [groaning] [grunting] Oh! [grunting] [growls softly] [deep growling] â™ªâ™ª [growls] [grunts] [all] Ooh! [distorted groaning] [whistle blows] That was a foul! And a sin. I'll confess later. Moose, you need some ice? [growls softly] Rico doesn't know what to do here. You have to stick with it to win. But in this case, I don't believe that's enough. Jake says the Underdogs always come through. But they don't stand a chance in this game, Skipper. Rico doesn't think Jake knows what he's in for. -[whistle blows] -Ace's team is stacked with all-stars. [exhales] So we need to even those odds. It's true. We can win together. Let's show Ace Underdogs can't be bullied. -Let's show him now! -Now! Do it for the town. And for Jake. [all] Underdogs! â™ª We are brave â™ª [all shouting] Go! â™ª Even though we might be afraid â™ª â™ª To place it all on the line We won't hesitate â™ª â™ª We've come too far â™ª -Go now! -[all shouting] â™ª 'Cause we are brave... â™ª Uh-oh, this is gonna sting. What?! [screaming] â™ª We are brave... â™ª [grunting] [screams] [announcer] Oh, Bubaye has hit the dirt for no apparent reason. [agent] Something's not right out there, Ace. Go over and check. Enough out of you. Holding me back. [announcer] The All-Stars are on the attack once again as they pass the ball in between that emo kid's legs. Let's go! [announcer] Jolson, over to Ace. And hold on tight, because here comes Ace bearing down on the goalie. And Ace could... go... all... the... Wait, that's-that's football. [grunts] [shouts] [grunting] -And it's off the post! -[shouts] -[cheering] -Hmm... -The Townies have dodged a bullet! -[birds chirping] -[exhales] -Ace, but... -You're useless! [grunts] All of you! [announcer] The Townies on the attack, looking to cross midfield for just the second time today. -And here comes Moose. -[Ziggy and Skip grunt] -â™ª If I could fly â™ª -Whoa...! -â™ª Then I would know â™ª -[announcer] Into orbit! â™ª What life looks like â™ª -â™ª From up above and down below â™ª -Wow. From here, the field looks like a foosball table, like they're the players and we're turning -the rods. -I see what you mean. Wow. Wonder if we look this way to Jake. It's incredible. Oh. I just wish this moment would last forever. Your cosmic mumbo jumbo's finally makin' sense to me, -Ziggy. -Oh, thanks, Skip. -You really mean it? -Not really. Um... -[Skip and Ziggy screaming] -[grunts] -[grunts] -[gasping] No! What? No. [Ace] Get up! -You're embarrassing me. -[whistle blows] Don't whistle at me, ref. This is my town. [announcer 2] And hold on! Fingers just stole the ball! What? [grunts] [Rip] Say hello to my little friend! [announcer] Air kick to Stinky! To Fingers! All the teamwork! -Over to the emo kid! -[grunts] Oh! Emo goes down hard! [hissing] -Oi! Creep! That was a cheap shot! -Pick on someone -your own size! -You mean us? That should be a red card! â™ªâ™ª [whistle blows] â™ªâ™ª [grunting] [announcer] Goal...! -[whoops] -[cheering] Goal...! -Yeah! Goal! -Yes! [cheering] [announcer] The Townies have scored on a free kick! Do you believe in miracles?! Yes! [announcer 2] Hey! That's not your line, man. -Don't be a plagiarist, man. -[panting] You okay, Cordoba? [grunts] I have seen things, my bro, I can never unsee. -Hold on. It's not over yet. -Ha! We still need one goal to tie. -What's the matter with you guys? -[whistle blows] [announcer] Ace seems to be blaming his own team again. -And Jake steals the ball! -[shouting indistinctly] -He passes it to Reilly, -Hey! -with Culbertson right on his tail! -I'm comin', Stinky! I-I got it! I got it! [announcer 2] How does he bend it like that? And that? And that?! Amazing! It's almost as if there's invisible players on the field! That little shrimp made you look like an idiot! [growls] [panting] [shouts] [whistle blows] -Hey, Coach. -What are you doing here? It's okay. Play it cool. We're evening the odds. The boys and I are on the field, and we're gonna help win this game for you. No. No, cheating is what Ace would do but not us. Are you loco? We're helping you to save your town! I'm gonna do this my way. Everybody knows that you can't beat Ace alone. -I believe in myself. -You need the team! We have a team. â™ªâ™ª [panting, wheezing] Come on! I'm ready. Come on! [panting] â™ªâ™ª [cheering] [grunts] All right, boys! To the sidelines! â™ªâ™ª [whistle blows] [announcer] Bob makes a perfect pass to Finkis. Fingers takes it. Over to McFine and back to Fingers. He crosses it low. -[grunting] -Here comes Stinky! How many legs are in there? They'll never get a clean shot! What?! Goal! -â™ª Say Geronimo â™ª -[cheering] â™ª Say Geronimo â™ª -â™ª Say Geronimo, say Geronimo â™ª -Hmm... â™ª Say Geronimo, say Geronimo â™ª -â™ª Can you feel... â™ª -â™ª Say Geronimo â™ª -[announcer] The home team ties it up! -Yay! -They may actually win this thing! -Yes! [panting] â™ªâ™ª [groaning] [grunts] -[grunts] -How much time left? -Enough for a miracle. -[blows whistle] Are you kidding me with that call? I know your mom! -[groaning] -Ooh! [announcer] Here's a pass to Fingers. Back to Jake. The town is going for broke. The goalie and his entire defense have joined the attack. -Townies giving it everything they've got. -[grunts] Jake to that emo kid, who sends it right back to Jake, who sends it on to Fingers and back to McFine, who's barreling down to the goal! -He takes the shot! -[grunts] -No, it's a pass to Jake! -[grunts] -Jake shoots! -[gasps] â™ªâ™ª Oh, he hit the crossbar! -He hit the crossbar! -[panting] That could've been the go-ahead goal! Oh, my! -[Ace grunts] -[crack] -[Jake shouts, moans] -[gasping] [gasps] Jake! -No! Dirty cheater! -[grunting] [announcer 2] Oh. Now you just hate to see that. -Now, this ain't the UFC! -[announcer] But the ref didn't see it! He says... he says play on! Oh, no! Ace is making his way -down the field towards an unguarded goal! -[grunting] -He's all alone! -No! [panting] Thank you! [chuckles] [announcer] But wait! Here comes Jake! [panting] -Can Jake catch Ace? -Mwah! Huh? [grunts] [crowd cheering] [Jake panting] Ace is entering the box! â™ªâ™ª [gasps] â™ªâ™ª [blowing whistle] [exhales] [clicks tongue] -[sighs] -Do you hear that, Skipper? Should be music to your ears. What is wrong with you? There's nothing to hear. That's the point, Skip. Ace won, but no one's cheering. Hmm? [wind blowing] -[sighs] -[chuckles] I won. I won! Goal! Goal! [laughing] [whoops] Back of the net! I won! -Come on! [laughing] -[Laura] Jake! Jake! -I'm here. Are you all right? -Thank you! Thank you! Yes! -We almost won. -Yes, I'm the greatest... Jake, just look around. You did win. â™ªâ™ª -Mwah. -[cheering] -[kissing] -[chuckles] [chuckles, gasps] [chuckles] Mwah. [cheering] Here you go, kid. Great game. [Laura chuckles] [cheering] Who are you applauding? The applause should be for me! Didn't you see me win? Are you people blind?! -I won! -So happy for you. And speaking of being happy, I quit. What are you talking about? You're just an agent. You do as I say! I'm the star! Stars fade away, kid. I got to tell you, you finally showed the world the real Ace. And they don't like you. [exhales] [chuckling] Oh! [laughs] [chuckling] [Ace] But I'm the star. [grunts] -[chuckles] -[cheering] Oh. â™ªâ™ª I'd give you my jersey. Too bad it's painted on. -Nice, bro. -Oh. -How about a hug? -[laughter] Oh, that's beautiful. [announcer] What a sight! Don't ask me how, but the Townies managed to get back into this game and hold their own -against the biggest superstars in the world. -Oh. -Yeah. [announcer] It's almost enough to make you believe in magic! [sighs] And then what happened? The next day, everyone decided to build their own town rather than stay in the one that Ace had taken over. No one cared you lost? You're right. We didn't win, but that's not what mattered. We still went out there and tried. -Still don't like the ending? -I guess it's okay. It's kind of hard to believe the whole story. Magic toys and all? Well, whether you believe the story or not, it's up to you. The point is, you don't have to be the best. -You just have to do your best. -Did you tell me that whole story just 'cause you don't want me to quit the team? It's just a story, Matty. Time for bed. Good night, buddy. [Rico] Rico thinks we need new team colors. Oh, blue would go with Rico's eyes. [Skip] We're not changing our colors. Am I right, Jake? [Rip] I'm red. I only wear red. -[gasps] -[Jake] I've kind of become attached to the green and yellow. Exactly! Why mess with a good thing? [Rip] Oh, yeah, play favorites again. Why not? [all gasp] [gasps] [chuckles softly] [chuckles softly] So you want to... play? [Matty] Hey. [chuckling] Okay, the Underdogs are up two to one, and I'm just trying to get everyone out there -to work to their full potential. -Mm-hmm. -The Rippers could use a coach like you. -[chuckles] [Skip] All right, Rippers! You finally got a coach! -No more excuses. Let's play! -[overlapping chatter] Dad, will you come to my game tomorrow? -I wouldn't miss it for the world, buddy. -Let's go. [player] Over here. Pass it! [Jake] So, Matty learned one of life's biggest lessons. At the end of the game, it's not the numbers on the scoreboard that count. It's who's at your side. â™ª Been around the world, I was 17 â™ª â™ª My mother in the seat Riding next to me â™ª [foosball players] Underdogs! â™ª The things I've learned From a broken mirror â™ª â™ª How a face can change When a heart knows fear â™ª â™ª For all the things My eyes have seen â™ª â™ª The best by far is you â™ª â™ª If I could fly Then I would know â™ª â™ª What life looks like From up above and down below â™ª â™ª I'd keep you safe, I'd keep you dry â™ª â™ª Don't be afraid, afraid â™ª â™ª I'm the satellite â™ª â™ª And you're the sky â™ª â™ª Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh â™ª â™ª Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh â™ª â™ª I've cafÃ© crawled Through Amsterdam â™ª â™ª Been around the world With a punk rock band â™ª â™ª And I've seen London And I've played Japan â™ª â™ª I've been knocked down I got up again â™ª â™ª For all the places I have been I'm no place without you â™ª â™ª If I could fly Then I would know â™ª â™ª What life looks like From up above and down below â™ª â™ª I'd keep you safe I'd keep you dry â™ª â™ª Don't be afraid, afraid â™ª â™ª I'm the satellite â™ª â™ª And you're the sky â™ª â™ª Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh Oh, oh, oh â™ª -â™ª The sky â™ª -â™ª Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh â™ª â™ª Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, Oh, oh, oh â™ª â™ª I'm the satellite... â™ª â™ª Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, Oh, oh, oh â™ª â™ª And you're the sky â™ª â™ª Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, Oh, oh-oh, oh â™ª â™ª For all the things my hands have held â™ª â™ª The best by far is you â™ª â™ª If I could fly, then I would know â™ª â™ª What life looks like from up above and down below â™ª â™ª I'd keep you safe, I'd keep you dry â™ª â™ª Don't be afraid, afraid â™ª â™ª I'm the satellite â™ª â™ª And you're the sky... â™ª â™ª Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh Oh, oh, oh â™ª â™ª And you're the sky â™ª â™ª Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh Oh, oh-oh, oh â™ª â™ª I'm the satellite â™ª â™ª Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh Oh, oh, oh â™ª â™ª And you're the sky â™ª â™ª Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh Oh, oh-oh, oh â™ª â™ª And you're the sky â™ª [rhythmic clapping] â™ª Feels like I need an army â™ª â™ª Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah â™ª â™ª Someone to stand beside me â™ª â™ª Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah â™ª â™ª Now my intention is clear â™ª â™ª What was out of reach is now so near â™ª â™ª I need you, I do, you know I really do â™ª â™ª I hope you need me, too â™ª â™ª I want you, I do, you know I really do â™ª â™ª I hope you want me, too â™ª â™ª We should be on the same side â™ª â™ª So just come on over tonight â™ª â™ª 'Cause I need you, I do, you know I really do â™ª â™ª I hope you need me, too â™ª â™ª With the loudest voice I'm calling â™ª â™ª Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah â™ª â™ª Shout back, let 'em hear the warning â™ª â™ª Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah â™ª â™ª Can't find the world on my own â™ª â™ª No, I can't do this on my own â™ª â™ª I need you, I do, you know I really do â™ª â™ª I hope you need me, too â™ª â™ª I want you, I do, you know I really do â™ª â™ª I hope you want me, too â™ª â™ª We should be on the same side â™ª â™ª So just come on over tonight â™ª â™ª I need you, I do, you know I really do â™ª â™ª I hope you need me, too â™ª â™ª I need you to help me â™ª â™ª Come on, come on, come on and help me â™ª â™ª I need you to help me â™ª â™ª Come on, come on, come on and help me now â™ª â™ª Stand with me now â™ª â™ª Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh â™ª â™ª Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh â™ª â™ª I need you, I do, you know I really do â™ª â™ª I hope you need me, too â™ª â™ª I want you, I do, you know I really do â™ª â™ª I hope you want me, too â™ª â™ª I need you, I need you, I need you â™ª â™ª I need you, I need you, I need you â™ª â™ª Oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh-oh, oh â™ª â™ª Oh-oh, oh â™ª â™ª Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh â™ª â™ª Whoa, oh, oh â™ª â™ªâ™ª â™ªâ™ª â™ªâ™ª
