It won't help them a damn bit. All that wailing and praying. Something different must be done, if you ask me. I'm not asking. -No, you daren't. But you know who's to blame. Don't act so sanctimonious. Everybody knows it. And not one who says it out loud. Moenen. In here she dares. -It doesn't give a damn. Whatever those bigots do, it doesn't give them a damn. With whom the plague came, that's how it will go. The plague didn't just come overnight. It all started the day Moenen arrived at the inn. I'm telling you, everything started with Moenen. And she, that slut... must burn. -Mariken? No, not her. Mariken had nothing to do with it. Get off it, Berthe. -Had nothing to do with it? Who sleeps with dogs will rise with fleas. Mariken, you must leave before it's too late. Why? -They're after you. They're after you. They'll grab you with Moenen gone. I'm innocent. Why would I? -You were with Moenen. When they saw Mariken, they saw Moenen. In the whole of Antwerp. What should I do? No one can leave the city. If you stay, you'll take the blame for everything. I'm scared. They want blood. -I don't want to die. How can they blame it on me? -There are worse things than dying. I'm not like you. I want to live and redo everything. You're... Hello, Berthe. -What do you want? Get lost. No civilians by orders of the bailiff. -I come from the Clarissa Monastery. Nor relatives. Our orders are to let no one pass. -Mother Superior. Berthe, Berthe van de Saspoort... also called Berthe the Night Cat... is accused of having sold her soul to the devil... and thus have brought a curse upon the city. He brought the plague. That devil. Moenen. -She's a whore. It's true, she has night eyes. -Was she sleeping with Moenen? Did you sleep with him? -Where's Mariken? Is she in the city? -Did you bewitch her? Or didn't he want you, a soulless whore. And then you sold him Mariken. You will burn for that, witch. Not you, I'd rather perish. I know who you are. You're Moenen's, with the one eye. You're delirious. -Don't touch me. I've seen you together, on the street. The taverns, eating, drinking, fornicating. You crawled for him like a bitch. -Hush now. That monk's habit won't help you. You'll perish just like me. Like everyone. You don't know what you're saying. That was someone else. Moenen has bewitched your soul. He's going to... You don't stand a chance. I'm sure of it. We know she's in there. -We want in. By orders of the bailiff... That slut. She's the one who brought the plague in here. You can only leave the city as a corpse. -She brought the plague in here. Make way. Make way. Goddamned, why do they piss on us? -That whore Mariken must be here. There are only drifters and stiffs here. -Right, that's bullshit. That slut had better not escape or you'll die, got it? And Berthe can burn at the stake. -The gates are closed. We're going to burn the place down. -There's nothing here. Nothing. Burn her. Burn her. Burn her. There are worse things than dying, she said. But what is living then? -What that is, Mariken? A game. Of life and death. It will never let you go. It rips you apart with its invisible claws. You know what dying means. And what is living? Life seemed so easy. A farm... Trees around it... Plants... Birds... An old wise man, who was my uncle. And now only death. Let the dead, bury the dead. Or was it the other way around? The living, the living. I don't know anymore. Nothing anymore. Perhaps the dead are the living. And the living, the dead. If it's getting late, towards the evening, then go to my sister's. She'll provide you with shelter for the night. Do not return if it's getting dark. -You think life is full of danger. It is. -Don't start again. Please go by your aunt's... -I'll see. Bye. Hello sweetie. Moenen. Whose is this? Come on guys, let's redo that scene. Mary and God. Come on, hurry up. Oh child, as I look upon the people, I'd almost plead... Wait, wait, wait... A high voice. The canvas. We don't have the whole goddamn day. Oh child... As I look upon the people... I'd almost plead for it to go away. That all is gone. That everything could once more, as was intended in the beginning,... could be repeated. Then God says: They shall die of sickness... They shall die of sickness, grief and death. Much lower man. You're God. They shall... -Yes, yes. They shall die of sickness, grief and death. Everything one can do unto others... will time and again be their share. -Be their share. Will time and again be their share. -They will pay for that. It's going to rain. -Yeah. Just know I'm not playing, if it rains as in Aalten. I was soaked to the bone. -Come on, hurry up. Plenty of girls to warm you up in Nymwegen. Just sluts with fungus on their thighs and tootless mouths. They hide the rest when comedians arrive. Just shut up for once. Hares and rabbits. Top heavy. Beautiful roosters. Beautiful hares and rabbits. Beautiful roosters. Observe carefully. And no effect on the jaw. Guaranteed. Every month... a brand new tooth will grow on the empty spot. Here you go. And now you. -Let me go. Let me go. I don't want to. Let me go. No, I beg you. Let me go. Let me go. No. Beautiful hares and rabbits. Top heavy. Buy them. Oh child... As I look upon the people, I'd almost plead for it to go away. Oh child, as I look upon the people... Here you go. -Keep going on like that... and you'll lose your voice during the play. Silence. Silence. Citizens of Nymwegen. Cease your earthly activities. Behold this play and listen... how God the Father, great and good... stages his creations. Performing a play of life and death... in the short time between cradle and grave... and through her advocacy... our Mother Superior. There where the good separate from the bad. Behold this play and listen how... How man hardens himself, how man dooms himself. How everything's coming to an end. What was heaven yesterday, is hell tomorrow. Today life. Tomorrow death. Behold it all and listen... how the Evil called by 100 names... the Horned Goat... the Split Hoof, the Black Death... the Evil Eye... or just that, what people call World... buys the souls, and dooms the souls. How he lurks and seduces. And wherever he goes... leaves behind a trail of blood and death. Aunt Agnes. Aunt Agnes, open up. It's me, Mariken. No talking. -No... We're almost there. -Come on men. Hey Goldy, where you going? -To the inn. Want to come? Your eyes are too big for the dark, my love. I want to be alone. -You're far too beautiful to be alone. Come. -No man can help me. Bah, man. But Moenen can. Neither can you. -Because you're afraid... and it's night. You're seeing unknown things. I'll teach you to know them. I'll teach you to laugh at the fear of others. To approach them and suck them dry. As a butterfly with a flower. Isn't a butterfly more than a flower? I've got to go. Nobody loves me. -Do you want me to help you? Yes. -You have spoken. Come on then, little night butterfly. What's your name? -Mariken. A Marylike name... Come on up. Hurry up, Mariken. Around it. I want to. -Not true. Just listen to that scum. Let's rattle their cages. Come on, get into the cart. Behold the Hell. And listen carefully. How I, known by 100 names... -To arms. Come on, to arms. The Horned Goat, The Split Hoof,... The Black Death, The Evil Eye,... burn the souls, and doom the souls. How I lurk and seduce and leave behind a trail of blood and death. Where's the king with his crown? In Hell, with all its dangers. Where is the virgin they adored? She burns. Hanged by the tongue. And the soldiers at the gate? In Purgatory. Smothered in their hornyness. What sang yesterday and was hot in bed... tomorrow a skull, a rotting skeleton. He's making a run for it. Grab him. Where are we going? -South. First Den Bosch, then Antwerp. The cart.. Did you think I'd leave you alone? I don't want to go inside. -I'm here with you. Hey, where did you find her? In a cesspit? They had a little screw in the gutter. Jesus Christ. You can't grab her even with pliers. Are you the laundry woman here? Get her cleaned. Very well. Come. Water in abundance. -Even a rag must be cleaned. I bet the pastor would also like to baptize them this way. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Evil Eye. Amen. You forgot your christening gown. And you get this dress, for being the most beautiful in the entire nation. That the ladies of Antwerp see green with envy. Well well. Hey. My dress. That slut is wearing my dress. Then you shouldn't let yourself get screwed out of your clothes. Keep out of it, you whore hopper. Here, for the effort. He gave it to me. Give it up, you dirty scum. Moenen. I'm going outside. Devil. You look so lovely. For you. That's what you want, isn't it? That they kill each other. the virgin, the whore and the wife laid their hands on his cheek they said it felt like a fire like a glowing fire in his body but his one eye stared black, nd his heart was as cold as ice the virgin, the whore and the wife took their clothes off the virgin, the whore and the wife, laid themselves on him but they didn't get past his skin his blood stayed as cold as ice You're scaring me. -Oh little one. Just calm down. Don't be afraid. When you're mine, you'll never be afraid. I don't want you singing that. and they said it felt like a fire like a glowing fire in his body but his one eye stared black and his heart was as cold as ice and they said it felt like a fire like a glowing fire in his body but his one eye stared black and his heart was as cold as ice The dress had to be blue and of a soft fabric. Just what I wanted. Always have. But tell me how it's possible... you already know everything about me. And what do you know about me? I have no bread, my lord. -Begone from here. Give alms to a poor fellow. You heard what I said. Away with you. Leave me alone. My lord. My lord, have mercy on this poor man, my lord. Begone. Must an honorable merchant be pursued on each and every road by you scum? I have a wife and 7 kids. Please, for the sake of the Mother of God. Here, take this and leave me alone. Thank you, my lord. God shall reward you. My hands are bound. I can't control them. Your Majesty. Mercy. Mercy. -And with his 7 little children,... 7 little souls are drowned. -No... Drowned. Seven little souls, drowned, drowned, drowned. Now that's a city, Anvers. Antwerp. -It's French. I'll also teach you that. The Gilden Tree Is this the Gilden Tree's stable? Come on, hurry. Help us please. Help... What was that, Moenen? Were they imprisoned? Shouldn't we do something? -Yes... Always make sure, you know more than the other. Come. Look at her. What a hot one. Damn. She's far too hot for the one eye. How can I help you, sir? -With whatever you want. But her... I want to eat her. -The best table in the house. Game, pie and some beer. And some jugs of red wine for everyone. Jesus. That mouth. -Mother Mary. She's a hot one. Tonight he will get the knife. Right away, sir. Right away, sir. You see, Mariken? Make them crawl. For your pretty eyes and my fat wallet, they'll do anything. If I asked them how many eyes I have... They'd say: All two sir. All two. Both for just a couple of coins. You must always be ahead. Buy them before they know they're being bought. Get them in trouble and see how they get out of it. Quietly watch them sink away. That's the whole secret. If you succeed, you're mightier than anyone else. Hey Tédé, it's my turn to throw. Strange... I could have sworn... Have a drink on me. We buy our own drinks. What do you want from us, when you can sit at that table? You don't walk away from such a woman. She won't from me. Even if she wanted to, she couldn't. You're very sure of your case, one-eye. Who could know better? Don't they like dancing? -Not horny enough, shit-eye? He doesn't even know what it means. Don't you dance the egg dance here? Put them on the table. I'm paying. Come on, Tédé. Not even a witch can succeed. -Your feet are too big. The next one. -Show us what you can do, Goldilocks. You're the prettiest little chick I've ever seen. She's a tough one. She steps on those eggs as she steps on people's hearts. She's a knockout, isn't she. Music, music. Come on, play on, play on. Mariken... You see you know more than them. Those two at the stable, remember. Listen everyone. In the Orient... Do you know what the Orient is? A clairvoyant there taught me the art of fortune telling. Fortune telling, he? Tédé wants the truth, Tédé the doubter. -Fortune teller? He can't even find the flap of his fly with his one eye. There's one number missing from your stone, Tédé. The number shown by the Kabbalah, with the letters of your name. Tédé, T and D. The Death. The rat in a tight spot. The knife at your throat. The plague in your blood. That's all called TD. Death... Darkness... Demon. Can't you be more cheerful, Moenen? It's just a game. The riddle of that jerk, is a barn. I will tell them that. It walks on four legs under a reed roof. It makes noise but doesn't say a word... Behold, there it comes through the port. Be careful with that suitcase. Hurry up. Wait till he gets on top. You'd wish you were him. I hope everything's in order, sir? Come on, off with you. And no mucking about. Old fatso. Has no one ever told you how beautiful you are? You are beautiful. As chaste as a beguine. As if she doesn't know what she has between her thighs. Or is she playing ignorant? -Like hell she is. Did you notice they couldn't take their eyes off you tonight? Neither could the wenches. And once you know that... That their eyes will undress you wherever you go. That you can get them anywhere you want. Then you'll be more beautiful than anyone else. What's taking him? He keeps talking. The wiser they are, the longer it takes them. No screwing around but work is what I always say. Goddammit. We also want to take a peek. She's not a virgin, is she? Sweet Jesus, if that were true. It's a virgin, as surely as I'm standing here. What are you afraid of? Let me look at you the way you are. As no one has ever seen you before. That bitch. Pretending she's happy for him. Maybe she is. -No, that's to wind him up. She's doing a good job. -With me she definitely is. To make dresses for a figure such as yours... fairer than the countesses at the court in Brussels... that's every cutter's dream. I'm not here for your dreams. You're not looking, Moenen. I can't make you forget the countesses at the court, can I? I want you to see me. Do you really think you alone possess him? Of course I do. -You're possessed. By him. That's different from to possess him. I know that. Then why do you allow it? Why do you act blind? But I possess him. -You're blind. You're possessed by him. Blind. -You don't scare me. I don't want you... -So what? I don't want him... -Tell him that. I know what it means to be possessed. It means burning and never be free again. And you, I don't want... -What do you want from me? We always lose. -Leave me alone. Whore. I'm strong. Thanks to him. You shouldn't talk such nonsense. I love him. And enough to... But your love isn't enough for him. The oracle speaks. Don't laugh at me. Who wants to possess life, loses it. Where did you get that? Who says that? -My uncle. He said: Don't expect too much of life. Do you want money and power? Ambition and jealousy will be your share. Never love... You're uncle said that? But love makes people do things that makes them powerful. Don't you agree? Very beautiful, but is it true? Your power over me, isn't that love? -Do I have that? So much, it hurts. So deep that should you leave me, I couldn't keep on living. That's how I want you. You know I want to hear that. Berthe says I'm possessed. Blind. That I don't know what you really are. And, that I... And that I shall fear myself. People like Berthe and your uncle the pastor, will always say such things. But not I. -They can have the Plague. You can't enter. I have a visitor. Wouldn't be a first, two at the same time. I hear you like to chat with Mariken. -What's it to you, one-eye? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Hello. -Tell him to fuck off, Berthe. Do you want me to cut it off? It will never itch again... I asked... What's it to you, one-eye? I'll tell you. I'm a free person. -Leave her alone. Or wait till she finds out for herself. And by that time, it'll be too late. An alms, my lord. For a poor soldier who has lost his legs on the battlefield. My lord. My lord. Citizens of Antwerp. Cease your pious and devout talks. And leave all those higher debates to the nuns and prelates. Let the jugs go around and help yourself. The sun is at its highest hour... The great thirst. The great fire. The gun, armed and ready. The girls, soft as an oyster, and their beds spread for horsing and riding. Life is a devilish game. And we the comedians, who play on a slippery floor that creaks on all sides. Forgotten... Eat and drink the wine. Forget what tomorrow can bring thine. The warm body, the soft skin. The fat belly, the full throat. A shriveled skin, that smells and rots. No no no, be good my lads. Don't enter the pub. No, that place isn't for you... Well what... What did he say? Jesus, Mary. Now that's quite a different little lamb. We can't touch her. Only a goat may plow her. Very regrettable. Do you know what happens when you stare like that, fair one? Hey oldtimer, have you gone completely mad? Show us what you have there. With his bare ass in public. You wouldn't go away again. Don't I always come home? You know that. -Do you call this home? This here? Why can't we leave? We've been here too long. This house reeks of Death. It frightens me. I want to leave. -Where to? You're enjoying it all. I sense danger, something I can't stop. -You're babbling. Who's threatening? -I sense hate everywhere. With me you have nothing to fear. Didn't you say: Even when you're not here, you're still with me. Yes, I did. If only I knew where to find you. Why am I not enough? -That's my business. You can't belittle me. -What's little, stays little. Go away. Bastards. Go away. Why not, fair one? When the goat's away... What a goat devours, the other also devours. Moenen. Help. It was Tédé. It was him. Swine. Moenen... Don't leave me alone. Don't leave me alone. What a bunch of misery. A place of ruin and death. Jesus Almighty, the pillmonger. Behold, how the black plague has already poisoned the blood. How liquor and abuse has affected their liver. How their spleen swells up under their belly. How their godforsaken lust... has softened the marrow in their bones. How they are but a mere shadow... of the first man and child that walked through the earthly paradise. How all diseases are revealed, in their faces and limbs... against which the wise of old times, the brilliant Aristotle... and the great Plato have warned. -Stop it, goddamned. Just look at yourselves for once. Your still young limbs filled with hate and weakness. Your minds intoxicated. How your body hangs, in between your friends. Just stop it, you quack. -You. Yes, you. Look at yourself. You have fallen prey to alcohol. Jesus. -The loser really hit the bottle. This potion... -I've never seen Tédé so drunk. Brewed from healing herbs, it protects you from the Black Death. Where in God's name should we go? To the marsh? -That's fine. No one goes there. You fools. Did you really think he'd leave it at this? So what? Only one can do with us as he pleases. Moenen. He has used you, so that all goes as he pleases. You shouldn't let him frighten you. No ordinary man can frighten me, but he's different. What is he then? May the devil take him. They will die of sickness, grief and death. All that one man can do onto the other... will time and again be their share. Against what has she sinned? Where's Moenen? -Where's Mariken of Nieumeghen? We must get Berthe. She knows too much. Mariken was here when Moenen left the city. Everything's his fault. Moenen, my lord. Moenen with the one eye. But you let him in your bed. -That's true. Yes, she was part of it. -He lies. I had nothing to do with it. A whore's word doesn't count. Evil wench. Moenen was seen in her room. If that's proven, she must burn. -Burn? Burn. Burn. Grab her. The living... Now I know. It's the living, that bury the living. The dead do nothing. Without evil, they sleep in between all the other things that died. What happened? And why? I loved them. I loved the children in the area... the women in the cornfields, the little man singing outside. When did I stop loving them? Why? Didn't I love them? Because you weren't alive. Now you know how they truly are. Not you. You've never seen them like I have. People... You travelled... before you started to live. And where you're now... you dream of them. I want you to take me there. Come. You have to stay with me and show me the way. Because maybe there I will love them again. The legal proof has been provided that Berthe of the Saspoort... has sold herself, with body and soul, to the devil. To that I shall testify, as sworn under oath. That she shall be shown to the public, chained by hands and feet. And then outside the city gate... according to the rules of the law... shall be burned as a witch on young brushwood until death follows. Filthy witch. Whore. Oh child, as I look upon the people, I'd almost plead... Are we starting? -With Mary, just after God. Come on, I've been wearing this mask for half an hour. Oh child, as I look upon... Come on, lets go. Oh child, as I look upon the people... I'd almost plead for it to go away. That all is gone. That everything could once more, as was intended in the beginning,... be repeated. And then comes God... They will die of sickness, grief and death. Everything one can do unto others... will time and again be their share. My righteousness shall withhold no one, in repentance they are saved. Dying is standing still. But no. These are the devil's words. Did you really think, you could go on without me?
