Yeah he looks like a junkie. [Mouse] That's how come he killed her. Killed who? His mother, she was getting his cocaine so he iced her. [Whitey] Wow. (all talking at once) Hey wait a minute, you're forgetting something that I'm the leader of this gang. What gang? [Kurtz] You kids get away from that fence.

[Professor] It's gross then, quit playing them. [Kurtz] We thought we'd let you stay next to me and my bunk. This is the Robert Louis Stevenson wing. This is your bunk. [Piper] Great. Cut that out. Here's your uniform, now unpack. [Mouse] He looks like a monkey. How come you got bars on your windows? That's to keep you from slipping on the highly polished floor, falling out the window, and contracting an abrasion, contusion, laceration, or puncture. If you ask me, I think he looks like a jerk. Girl I swear you are all mouth. So what do you bet he makes a run for it? [Mouse] He gave him Sherman's old bunk. What ever happened to old Sherman? They sold him off a year and a half ago, remember? Oh yeah. They did? Hey Whitey, before you was born did your mama do a lot of acid? Give me that. Hey you touch that, I kill you. That's my mother. Oh. Oh, Kurtz! [Kurtz] Get back here. [Joey] Wait up you guys, I gotta tie my shoe. Morning, Sister. (woman screaming) Good morning. You wanted me? I'm Dr. Bender. I'm going to be your psychiatrist, Piper. Sit down, take your shoes off. Let's be pals. You like to play gin? What's wrong Piper? Something's bugging you, something way down deep. You can tell me, I'm Dr. Bender. I'm going to be your psychiatrist, Piper. You got not bars on your windows. Tell Dr. Bender what's wrong. Is it sex? I'll tell you what, now Piper, you tell me everything you know and I'll fill in the gaps. Whoo Piper. Protein see? Oh you kids are so wild. [Woman On TV] Oh, the high seas. Okay stand up, we gotta get all the energy we got.

Nurse Bates, please. You're supposed to say grace. Oh, drink your milk kiddies, it's good for you. Dearest God, bless this food. May it strengthen our little bodies and help us to grow. And God bless Mother Celestina for founding the home, dear mother. (calm music) (flatulating) (people gagging) That's about it Lord. Amen. (all shouting at once) Mouse pissed on some broad, pass it on. Mouse pissed on some broad. Mouse pissed on some bread. Mouse pissed on that bread. Bread? Announcement. Children quiet.

Who did that? Tasty spuds. You're seven minutes late. Sit down Piper, and don't start. (upbeat jazz music) Boo. That's Mouse's seat. Oh yeah, who's Mouse? Hey, what are you looking at pervert? We've already said grace, Piper. You may say one of your own. One of your own. (upbeat jazz music) [Chubby] What a schmuck. I hope you realize you're going to eat that young man. All of it. I'm not hungry. Looks good to me. Can it, Chubby. Piper, eat. (plate bangs) (children moaning) (dramatic music) Kurtz, escort Piper to the meditation chamber please. With pleasure. (dramatic music) Come on baby, come on. I'll crush your skull like a pie crust. Son of a bitch electrocuted me. We now have two in the meditation chamber. Anyone care to be the third? (plates banging) (whistle blowing) (all shouting at once) (somber music) What'd you do that for? This ain't no fish fry. Hey man, you're a racist just like me. Put it there, man. You know I can't stand white people. You really kill your mother? I what? We hear you orphaned yourself. And here did you hear that? From him. And where'd you hear that? Have you been lying to me again? Would I lie to you? [Blackie] You'd lie to your own mother if had one. All right kid. Man I ain't no goddamn orphan, I'm an undesirable. Then why they ship you here? Got an unfit parent, what you call ward of the state. But not for long. You mean you're gonna break? We're gonna break too, right guys? Yeah right. You kidding me? You guys could never hack it on the outside. You got no street smarts. Hey, them fighting words white boy. Hey, who said that? Me. Oh sorry, couldn't see you in the dark. Look you're cruising white boy. Oh no, scare me to death, scare me to death. Hey, pick on somebody your own size. You a boy or a girl? What difference does that make? Yeah, obviously a girl. Typical homo, can't even tell the difference. You guys are so lame. You got a lot to learn. Yeah, too bad I won't be around to learn it. (all shouting at once) [Robot] Good night Kurtz, sleep tight. Don't let the bed bugs bite. [Kurtz] Silence. (harmonica playing) [Larry] Kurtz, Frank said the F word. [Frank] Did not. [Larry] Did too. [Frank] Did not. [Larry] Did too. [Frank] Oh fuck you Larry. I'm not the one that wipe smeared. [Larry] I know, you used all the toilet paper. Oh shit. [Frank] The odor's coming out of your sleeping bag. [Larry] It's not, it's coming out of yours. That's why it's all brown. How many men have you killed? Don't you ever give up? Just tell me how many. Seven. How many with your bare hands? 11. Silence. Pretty good. (calm music) ♪ Jesus loves me this I know ♪ ♪ For the bible tells me so ♪ You're gonna break huh? Take me with you. You're nuts. I got a plan. You got a plan? You don't even got hair on your cock. Gonna need money. Look, my mom's got tons of money. Okay. Good luck. [Professor] Could you please send me some water? Now Piper. Apparently the judge thinks you're a pretty rotten kid. It says here that when you were six you were sticking up lemonade stands with a gun. It was a staple gun, Oh really, have you ever had somebody put a staple in your eye, have you ever felt what that was like? Have you ever sat on a jackhammer? Did you, did you enjoy it? Excuse me. Now Piper. (whoopie cushion expels air) I noticed you list your mother's occupation as entertainer. What kind of entertaining did she do? Don't talk about my mother. I want you to talk about her. I love my mother. You and the Dodgers. (punch lands) Whoo, Piper. You little rascal, you messed up my makeup. (air horn blows) Oh shit. (horns blaring) (dogs barking) (all shouting at once) (80's rock music) Guys the fence, warn him about the fence. Man he's gonna fry for sure. (electricity crackles) Oh man. [Joey] Is he dead? Bates, pick him up, dust him off, and throw him in the meditation chamber. Yes Sister. Why don't she come out here walking through this field? Shit my feet hurt, these damn weeds. Piper, let me find that little motherfucker, I'll kill him. Did I hear cheering? I thought I heard cheering. So what if you did? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Thanks for telling me about the fence you guys. [All] You didn't ask. This is the the last time I ever stick up for that ingrate. Yeah. Shut your face. Hey bite my hiney. [Joey] Your mama. (punches landing) Get of me. You guys don't fight fair. I like that. Blood brothers. Too corny. Listen asshole, real blood is never corny. (calm music) What did you cut that one for? My favorite. (groaning in pain) Let's see if the man's afraid of a little of my blood. (80's rock music) You guys mind if I fake it? Yes. I can get a bloody nose just like that. (80's rock music) Hey, it's pretty good, all right. Aren't we supposed to say something? Family. [All] Family. From now on, it's us against them. Who's them? Okay, everybody out. I said everybody on the floor! (pots banging) Have one. I've had enough of that stuff. [Chubby] Who sat on my food? [Kurtz] Now remember children, today is visiting day. That means we should all be in a clean uniform, on our best behavior. We should all stay close to our bunks. We'll be meeting some lovely prospective parents. Here want to look? [Joey] Where's Sister Serena this morning? She went outside about 10 minutes ago. Hey something's fishy. Yeah, the egg. [Mouse] Gross it's an egg paddle. This is the cafeteria. Don't get up. Our children are raised on a high protein, low fat diet. (fly buzzing) And they love it. Of course the Bleeding Heart child represents a very special challenge to today's modern parents. Some of them are extraordinarily bright, and terribly damaged. Nice red head. [Whitey] If she likes red heads. Well, let's see I'm sure we'll find something. [Piper] Yeah like lice. How about something a little south-of-the-border? No, we already have a gardener. Oh, well, let's see, how about a blonde? [Piper] How about a kick in the teeth? (fly buzzing) Fingers are hurt, gnarled. And we have blonde. (laughing) Of course, silly. Already, yeah. Oh hi, cute. [Warren] Oh my God. They're a matching set. We can't have half of the set? No. No they cannot be separated, take two. I love the clean one. Well, how about this, nice conversation piece? Oh little munchkin, sweetie. Darling, he's adorable. Yeah? (flatulating) Is that a major gastric problem he's got there? Oh no no, no it's cafeteria food. It's nothing disgusting? Oh no no, you take him out, start him on ice cream, it'll smooth right out. Great news. (burbs) He is, he is adorable. But, you think he will match the other two? I don't think he should. I think it's better if he stands out like a sore thumb. Don't you? I mean. I think it's got much more impact if we make it painfully obvious that he's adopted. Well, we've already had a bid on this one. Oh, well we can top it. Really? Say cheese. (camera clicks) [Mother Celestina] Say what? Here son, let me put your things in the trunk. All right you hang on to that. [Professor] Eat your heart out justice. I can't believe it. It's because you're so damn cute. I am not. You are too. Well anyway, I already got a family, right guys, guys? Garth has been having some problems. But we just thought it was time to get some new blood in the family. Now Sarah's perfectly normal mind you, perfectly normal, my Sarah. Oh look, he's got a little football helmet. A macho little thing isn't he? Beautiful car. It's yellow, yes. Beautiful color. You like it? It's mine. [Warren] German made. Incredible resale value with these things. But as you say, who's selling? God is your mother a dog. Boy you'd think with the price of gasoline today that little beaner could at least catch the headlights as well as the windshield, wouldn't you dear? [Gladys] Lovely dear. Thank you, thank you. You didn't have a chance man. The way sardine face was pushing you. She was desperate man, she hasn't moved a kid off this lot since the Christmas rush. The inventory's been stacking up.

Piper, did you say something? Yeah, eat me. Amen. (all shouting at once) Well isn't this nice? All of us together, calm, civilized, sharing. Darling, since when does Carnation have to cook him a special meal? Oh, there's no cooking involved dear. After all, he eats it raw. This fish was frozen. [Sarah] Nice diapers, Garth. (record scratches) Are those prescription sunglasses, son? No. Would you mind taking them off? Yes. Bartholomew, are you done with your artichoke? [Mouse] Yeah. Then would you ring for the soup? What? I said why don't you ring for the soup? I don't get it. You pick up that little bell right next to your plate, and you ring it, and Carnation brings us the soup. Why don't we get our own soup? Well we could of course. But it's nicer this way, don't you think? Nicer for who? Oh just ring the damn bell. Oh. (screaming) Oh Jesus, that's a Tiffany bell. (all shouting at once) Come on, spit it out, out. (all shouting at once) It's coming out young man. Doctor he's choking. Well, for God's sake call an ambulance. [Mouse] Let me go. Cough if up, you little fart. (speaking in foreign language) (silver clattering) They were stealing our silverware, oh my God. If I find the key to the rolls in there, you are history. [Gladys] You wouldn't believe what happened. Bartholomew swallowed the bell, the dinner bell. Did seem at all depressed? [Gladys] I don't know, why would he do something dumb like that? [Sister Serena] Has he at any time expressed a desire to kill himself? Well, I suggest you make arrangements to have his stomach pumped, immediately. He's taken the old dive for the medicine chest. Swallowed every pill in sight. Oh no, I'm afraid he's yours. [Gladys] No. [Sister Serena] Check your contract. You have him a minimum of a year, and don't you dare give him back to me dead. Gees, he's just a little kid. We've got to rescue him. How? We've gotta escape first, come on. How many did you give him? 10 milligrams, he's out like a light. Well, give him 10 more. What do you want to do dear, put him in a coma? Just for a year. Warren. Gladys. [Blackie] Are you sure he tried to kill himself? [Joey] They're pumping his stomach right now. (dramatic music) [Whitey] Well, maybe she's just a really rotten cook. [Blackie] Shut up, Whitey. We never should've let him go. (dramatic music) Yeah, but we're gonna get him back you guys okay, tonight. We have to figure out a way to get over that fence. What if we drugged sardine face? And Kurtz. And bag Bates? What if we just kill them? Stay out of this. Hey, wait a second you guys. What if we kill the fence? Don't be stupid, you can't kill a fence. I mean we can go down to the basement, we can kill the juice. (dramatic music) (liquid flowing) [Joey] Don't forget to put the seat down when you're done. (keys clacking) You asked to see me, Sister? Yes Kurtz, come in. You look tired. Drink? You know I can't drink. Well, I think things have been going very well lately. Don't you Kurtz? What do you think? I love you. Don't be silly. I'm a nun.

Yes Sister, what you want? I thought I told you to clean up that kitchen. I just clean up the goddamn kitchen. [Joey] It looks filthy. Hey listen baby. I gotta go mutilate some little kids. Hey, I see you in the sack tonight all right? (mimics sucking) I love you. - Ta da. - Perfect. No way, you guys got a mess up the kitchen. Blackie, come on. You're going the wrong way. [Joey] Yeah, but Pepe went the right way. [Piper] Come on Whitey, we'll get the fence. (80's rock music) Pepe, is that you? Listen you ugly bitch. You get the hell out of my life or I'll punch your freaking face in. How dare you. (80's rock music) (speaking in foreign language) (80's rock music) What the hell are you doing?

[Joey] If we get disguises, they're never gonna find us. (calm music) Now what? We gotta go north. [Piper] Oh great, which way? This way. Some method. Actually it's flawless. You see, the ocean is near here somewhere running on a north and south axis. The prevailing daytime convection current is an offshore wind going perpendicular to the coast, making the ocean there, and north this way. Perpendicular to the axis? That's right. [Whitey] Well in that case you guys, let's hit it. [Joey] Hold on you guys, I'm gonna wet my pants. [Piper] Perpendicular to the ocean, huh? Yeah, an ocean of weeds. [Joey] I can't believe we swallowed that line. [Blackie] Yeah, well I can't believe you swapped spit with a rat. [Whitey] I can't believe that... [Piper] Whitey, don't try to talk and walk at the same time, you can't handle it. [Joey] I wonder how Mouse is doing. [Whitey] What if he's dead? Get on. Wait a second. Smart. Wouldn't want to see that little brain spattered all over the highway now would we? (80's rock music) [Joey] I'm thirsty. [Blackie] Ah man. [Piper] I thought you had to pee.
