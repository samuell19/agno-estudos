based on true events It looks like worms actually. It looks like... gold... Some more eggs, because... More eggs. Are you serious? You're the one, who does... I said you're helping me. Stop. It's sticky! I'll make chocolate cookies. More, more, more... And stop! - Wait a minute... - Unfortunately this cake is gonna be on. We need flour! What the hell... Thank you very, very much. We need flour... CAT IN THE WALL Watch your step, bitch! - What a fucking idiot! - Shut up! It's like... No! I need to do something. I'm not expecting this. Are you serious, how...? Jojo, sweetie, what happened? - Look at it! - What are you making? Cake. For the boys. - It's a disaster. - Is it? Where is your uncle? Vlado! What's up, brother? We're making a cake. What cake? A cake for Halloween. Please, what Halloween? Have you seen the state of the kitchen? It's superb! So what? Let's put it in the oven! Let's make a train track! Listen, someone pissed in the lift again. I've had enough! My bags are dropped all down the stairs. I can't take it anymore! - Wait a minute! - Everything's fine! To top it all, the Polish woman got the Bussey Building Renovation Project! - But easy, next year... - It isn't your job to clean... - Let me clean it up. - Give me the mop... I'm sick of it... I want to clean it! Such filth! We'll die in this filth! The Polish woman got it! They gave it to her... It's not your job to clean the lift! She won the commission, so I'll clean! I should have won the project, but no! I won't make it as an architect in this country! Look, I'm freezing, I'm going inside. Wait, go downstairs and pick up the food. Come on. Let's pick it up. What are you doing? Come on, man, please. Quick, people are coming. Here. It's just me carrying... Come on! Give me the... C'mon girls. Who dropped toys down the toilet? - Jojo, where's your other sock? - I don't know where it is! The frog is in the toilet. Oh no, the frog. I'll live there one day. Pardon? Better buy something on the moon. With this gentrification... Exactly with this gentrification. Brother, you use such trendy words. - Do you know what gentrification is? - Of course, I know, it's my job. - What does it mean? - Improvements and rising prices. - Gentrification, sister, is when... - Yes? ...middle classes move in the working class' neighbourhoods and change the local character. And you read that in some Socialist dictionary in Peckham Library, didn't you? Indeed. - You spend too much time there. - Too much, yeah. While others kill themselves working in the zombie apocalypse. - What are you trying to say? - What am I trying to say? - Are you suggesting something? - Yes, I am suggesting something. What? That I am a zombie? Who's paying your bills? The zombie. And who's looking after your kid and deals with the boiler man? Stop. Wait. A crocodile. Nice one. Do it like an eagle. Do it like a... an elephant. Do it like a cat. Wait, think about it. A cat. Here your Mum will do a project. What do you think? - I don't believe you. - You don't believe me? - Yeah. - Look at me. I will get it, boy. Can I ask you something? Why do you think you have to talk about Marxism, Trotsky, which is past, which didn't work? I think those ideas are more relevant today than they've ever been. They'll always be relevant if you talk about Nietzsche and all these people. They'll be relevant forever like Shakespeare and all that. - Where are you coming from? - From Bulgaria. So, could you describe that as Socialism? What do you think about east Europeans coming to live in your country now? I'm not in the habit of protecting my workers on national basis. We're saying that those east European workers are your brothers and sisters and your bosses are a shared enemy. Hi, Irina, I'll just give you some information about the works. - Come in. - No, I'm really busy. Just for a minute, please, I wanted to ask you something. OK, just quickly... I was just about to come to your house but you came so that's fine. Just bear with me a second, I'll make a cup of tea. It has to be quick now. - Have you seen all the scaffolding? - Yeah. You know about the works? - Yes, just a second. - What do you want - tea or coffee? - I'd love a coffee, please, two sugars. - And milk, thank you. - No problem. Yes, I've seen the scaffolding, but I don't know what they are doing there. - There's a lot of work to be done. - Is it? I killed him there like... Look, when I spawned in the server I saw a mini creep he exploded. Yeah but d'you know, the biggest creeper ever I killed in Minecraft is the Spider and I turned him into a big Zombie. I think I might be able to get it from upstairs, just bear with me a second. Hi. Hello, Ghost! I am the black witch. You are definitely not a zebra, ah... a cook! Trick or treat? - There we go. - That's a solid treat. Come on, kitty. What's up, dear? Sweet pussycat, what are you doing here all alone? Who left you all by yourself? What's up? Look what I've found. A librarian. Let's see. This? "The British Museum recruiting librarian". And... - A teacher? - And it's close to here. That's good. You can be a history teacher, which is absolutely great. But you have to take a one-year training course, pedagogical... It's called postgraduate. But I've done all this in Bulgaria. Here they recognise our university degrees, but not our work experience. And your work experience was only six months. They wouldn't accept it. Study this. - I have work to do... - Wait, stay here. I can't. Wait, what postgraduate course? How many postgraduate courses should I take? I have a Master's degree from Bulgaria! They want you to build a teacher's profile or something like that. And if you apply for this scholarship it won't matter, because they only care to take your money. "Postgraduate course" means "Master's degree"! I have it! So do I, but now I have to finish the damned project... I'm sick of working in bars, you know. Read it. If you don't understand something, tell me. Let me do my work. If it's so hard to find a job here, what are all these people living off? Brother, are you pretending you don't know? They are on benefits, that's what. Why can't we live off benefits too? And not waste our time anymore. What are you talking about? Why did I leave "Bulgaristan"? Because of the mafia and arse-kissers. I didn't come here to be a leech! I'd rather be a zombie than live on benefits! What was that? The ginger one. The cat - you saw it too? - Wait, not that salami! Don't you dare. - Just one slice. Don't you even think... It'll come every day! It won't! It's perhaps starving. This is a cat! It can find food alone! It'll start coming every day and Jojo will see it... I told you, no salami! Stop this! Where are you going? Good luck with your project. What's happening? Could you do me a big favor and help me with updating my CV? If you've got some time. - Now? - If possible. Five minutes. OK, come in. Here you go. - Careful, it's hot. - Thank you very much. How often do you have to go and do these? - I just went on courses. - Like what? When I'm unemployed I just go down to those places and study. Every three months or... - Whenever. - Yeah... They call you and you just have to go and update. My God, that's great. But it's only carpentry? No, that one was brick laying. - The other one's... - One's... through a computer. Oh, I see! And then there's... All different ones. Yeah. - Painting and decorating? - Yes. - Tiling. - And tiling? Yeah... Plumbing. When you come as a carpenter, you've got to learn every trade. - Really? - Yes. Wow, I never... Because... when you go on sites, you find that the main manager on the site is an ex-carpenter. They've got to know all these trades... They do? ...and read drawings. Basically, we need to give them an idea when they go for three minutes... They go - yeah, alright or no, not alright. "We're gonna call this man, because it's easy to read..." We've got to wash him and he's got to live with us! Let's show mum what we found outside. This is Paddington Bear. Very good. However get out in the other room. I don't have time for you now. We must wash him and he must live with us. Bravo. Please wash him, wash yourself too. Leave me alone. My deadline is tomorrow and I'm going mad. And on top I've got an extra shift at my stupid work. - Alright! - It's not alright. - And calm down. - Quiet! I simply had enough. I need silence! This work will drive me crazy. No! Wait pussycat. Ah, where's your home, sweetie? Go home. No, no, no... Don't go upstairs! I've got to... Apple and raspberry? Yeah? Would you like glass with ice or just a straw? Yeah, and... Here we are. Sorry? I've not put it on, I will now. Sorry. Paying on the card, yeah? Come here, sweetie... Here, kitty, kitty, kitty... Let me see where you're hiding. Kitty, I'll give you something. I felt sorry for it. Little bit. It's dusty down there. Watch over that side. It ran away. In the kitchen. There he is. The cat's "traveling" very slowly... I can't believe this! I will sleep next to you. With me? And the cat. Nice. Here we are with the kitty. The Owl and the Pussy-Cat... went to the sea. - ...in... - ...a... - ...beautiful... - ...pea... - ...green... - ...boat. Yes. - They took some... - ...honey... ...and plenty of money... I have to say "plenty of money". Oh, sorry. Again. - They took some... - ...honey... - ...and... - ...plenty... - ...of... - ...bunny. Who is Debby? You know Debby. She lives in flat 32. On the first floor. - I don't know them. - You do, you know Debby. Her son is Jack. They've got the pit bull. - Them? - They've lost a cat, as far as I know. Right, OK, so... Are you sure it's them? They've got all the animals, it must be. Because nobody asks anything about a cat. There's no big deal. Just give them 50 quid. But, anyway, you've got more important worries here. All your bills coming up. You do realize how this works. - Tell me about this one. - Hey, Sharon, how is it going? I'm just delivering the leaflets about the major works. - Did you get a new pet then? - Yeah, just got it microchipped. And the cat has a passport. It can go on holidays now. Oh, how lovely. - He is a gorgeous ginger cat, isn't he? - Ginger, you see? That's how we should have called him. Ginger, not Goldie. Because he's golden. He's golden. Isn't he gorgeous? He's very soft, isn't he? Young lad, he has his reasons. - Come, you. - Did he like the vet? The cat's running away. Come back, cat. Want some more tea or coffee? No, I'm fine, thank you! I'm going to have to go soon. You've got all these bills coming. You do understand about your charges? What is it? OK, right... What's happened is some of the balconies have collapsed, so they have to rebuild them. The windows have to be done, there's new doors... The Council will charge the leaseholders for a portion of the works. You're going to have big bills coming. You do know that, don't you? Have you written to the Council? You need to write to them and ask... God, how can they do that? You must've known this when you bought your flat. No, I didn't. They'll actually top it up... My bills are gonna be like what? 30,000? It is going to be a very big bill. It could be 25,000, 20,000, 30,000, I don't know. So, basically all the flats will get the new windows, and only few people like me... We're gonna pay for all the flats! No, you're not going to pay for all of the flats. You're going to pay your share of the bill. But not all of the people living in this block will pay... No, tenants don't own their properties. It'll add value on yours. That's what I mean. What am I supposed to do with this, if I don't want that to happen. I didn't ask for it. Why do I have to pay for it? "Antep..." "Antepenultimate". "Antepenultimate". Cold War warning as Russia hits back at Britain Easy! I'll take your guns and I'll put an end to this war! - Do you hear me? - Yes! Enough! - Do you live here? - Yes, 49. Who always wee-wees in there? Is it a dog? Right in the corner there's a stain. - Is it a dog or is it a person? - It's a person. A couple of weeks ago... You see, this side of the lift? That's my kitchen. - There. - It happened there. But why they do it in the lift? Inside it. Why do people kill people? I mean, you know, just brains. This lift has become a toilet. I'm sick of carrying bags up the stairs! - What's happened with the project? - Nothing. - Why? - I've had enough! My pathway project went down the drain but... I'd better win the coffee shop project. You'll get something eventually. Even if I do, I don't know how much it'll help with the bills. £26,000 for the repairs! I don't know what we're going to do! That's it. We'll be paying for these scroungers! They lie about all day, get their benefits, smoke weed! I always thought that this bill is for the whole building. Brother! The entire bill is a million and a half. This is divided between us, the flat owners. The ones on benefits pay nothing! That's the situation. And they receive new bathrooms and kitchens for free! I'll call Kiro for the job with the TV aerials. Nice to know Kiro. You can be installing aerials all your life, till retirement, till you die you won't be able to pay this. For two windows - £26,000. As if they are made out of gold. And they say - Bulgaria is a corrupt country. The Council launders money freely. It's because their lower-middle classes don't dare to oppose. They can put their pants down... You know, like the Russian when the White Army came and then the Red Army... In both cases - you bend over and take it! Very strange. What is the next number? Next one is 27. Why is this 4, 5, and then 26? What's the logic? Why have they burned this thing, what kind of people live here! Have you got a letter like this? Are you renting, because I've got the names... What number are you, 65? I'm not on your list. The bill about all this work? The bill that came from nowhere? - No consultation, nothing? - Yeah, exactly. I'm organizing a meeting with all the leaseholders, if you're happy to join. Excellent idea. I'm more than happy to join. So that'd be great, if you just put your e-mail here. I work in the week. It could be in the evening or in the weekend? Weekends it's better. Maybe on the 4th. - In the afternoon. - That'll be absolutely fine. It's insane the way the Council is treating us as cashpoints. - They do, don't they? - Absolute madness! - Absolutely disgraceful! - We got a lot to talk about. - Yes, exactly. - Hello, young man. - Thank you very much. - Good to see you. See you soon. - I found 45! - Where, show me! We just had our windows done... Did you, how was it? They were really good but it will take a long time to get the dust away. They were good, and it's nice to see something positive. But yeah, let's go. So, after three. Yes, thank you very much! - Bye-bye. - Bye-bye. Don't think you, little... It's a subway. What the heck just happened? Guys, take a look at this. You'll see, we'll be next. They wouldn't do such costly work, if they were planning on demolishing the building. They'll recoup their money easily. My cat. I came to take it. So you like climbing... You like it! Nice to meet you. I eat you. Oh, my God, he wants to go on me. Oh, my God... Boys, what are you doing there? Get back here, quickly! - We took the cat for a walk. - Come up quickly! We'll fix a spool on the wall and put him in a basket and we'll lower him down from the window. Basket? Home, now! I am not coming home. Don't you talk back. Come home, now. Come on, quickly. Come on, Jojo. Let's go. Jump down. Jumping down. What's up with you? - Are you retarded? - What's your problem? How should I know not to take it out? It's a cat, not a dog! Where do you think you are? Mummy, someone's knocking on the... Do you live here? Do you have a cat by any chance? Sign here. This is for the lion. The mail. What? We have cat's litter! I'll tell you what! I've had enough of you! Go. You go too. It's a bit boring - you pay for petrol, waste time, you can be at another address. - You make an agreement... - They don't care. I've no idea where we are. In the middle of nowhere. A Roma guy calls you and asks you to come now. You say - I can do it next week Tuesday. He says fine but can you do 10 in the morning? I say - 5pm. He says fine. I've got two men drilling here, and making noise. They're ruining the building. No, the girl hasn't let them do so. Can't tell me where they're coming from. They're rude and aggressive. If we don't get a signal... It'll be a typical disaster. You're not allowed to come here and make noise... A typical Roma disaster. I'm going to talk to the neighbours. Because I need to find out who ordered it. This is outrageous. You haven't even asked my Dad. It doesn't work like this in this country... You never know which of the darkies are going to stir up problems! Come to the door and ask the girl together. Why should we come to the door? We've already been upstairs. I was upstairs talking to this girl. She can't tell me what you're doing here. - The neighbours hadn't even ordered it. - Speak with them again. - You don't have a permission. - We have job to do here. My dad owns the building. Here is the notary of the property. I'm calling the police. And the local authorities. You've got the baddies' accent! The darky hated it. Where did she spring from? Do you think there are going to be problems? No, it's their problem if they have nothing to do. - If the police comes? - What can they say? The Owl and the Pussy-cat went to the sea... in a beautiful pea-green boat. Let's take turns? - They... - ...took... - ...some... - ...honey... - ...and... - ...plenty... - ...of... - ...money... - ...wrapped... - ...up... - ...in... - ...a... - ...five... - ...five... No, you're copying me. Sorry, I copied you. Let's start over. We've got the owl and the pussycat. Are we gonna marry them? You are making... Go and get the fucking cat! You did steal it! - Listen to what you're saying! - The cat was on the stairs! It costs 10 pounds, yeah... 10 pounds to get a cat. But no - you fucking thieve it! Go get it! - The cat was on the stairs! - Look at me! - Go get the cat right now! - Go and get it! - Are you being serious right now? - Arsehole! - What's going on here? - He's taken the cat! - You have taken our fucking cat! - The cat was here on the stairs. In the middle of winter and we kept him warm and fed! - Get lost! Get our cat! - It's not your cat, actually. Go ge'it! - Has he called me a gay? - No, he said, "Go get it!" It's not your fucking cat! Give us the cat! - What are you doing? - What do you mean? - Give me back my cat! - You've taken our cat! - Give her the cat! - This is ridiculous. - This is not your cat! - Go and get it! - Go inside and get the cat! - This is not your cat. - Give us back our Boo. - You're scaring my baby. - That's ridiculous... - What's ridiculous? That's our cat! Don't be scared, just stay here and play. Don't shout at my face. Step back. Now, listen... Right, legally I'd say this cat is ours, because we've put a chip in it... But did you leave a note about a cat? - To whom? - To us! Can you fucking read? Who do you think you're fucking talking to? College kids, racists! Go back to the country you came from! - Racists... - Go back... Which part of Africa do you come from? Yeah, which country are you coming from? I was born in Essex! Give me back my cat! - Can you bring out my cat! - Shut up! Don't talk to her like that! You come over here, you suck up our benefits. - And now you take her cat as well! - What? Oh, my... - Go back home! - Oh, my God! Now, listen, you're talking about benefits? You're talking about benefits to me? You're sitting all day on your fucking arse, and scratching your balls there, and I'm working to get your benefits in your freaking pocket, you know? So shut up! I'm calling the police, man. You're in for it now! - This is not your cat. - Yes, it is. Now we're screwed. Give them the stupid cat! I'll give you the fucking cat! No, don't! - Let's call the police. - Hold on! Go and call the fucking police! Police will deport me? I just got some work... I'm here with my wife and my 8 months old son. And my sister is shaking with fear. Where exactly? We're in front of flat 49, on the top floor. First entrance on the right. You guys, are in for it now. Yeah, Whitby Street, SE14 7JN. We didn't have to do this, but you didn't bring out the cat, did you? Let's see who has actually left the cat for three days... Three days staying over there. Wet, shitting itself - nobody cares. It was freezing in the middle of the winter. I'm not gonna set a foot inside this place, until the police get here. I ain't thief. But we're getting attacked in our own block of flats. We're not attacking you. You learn five English words and now you're top dog. Who the fuck, is that your mum? Sorry to trouble you. Are you wrecked again? Let me settle this with the people quietly! Now sorry that your kid's upset, but that cat was a present to my daughter Phoebe. She's only a kid too. She's only 12. Don't you remember that Jojo used to play with her in the backyard? Phoebe, you remember, don't you, Phoebe? You used to play in the backyard with Jojo. They don't understand. They don't realise. - They do understand. - They don't understand. I need to talk to them. - The cat's gone. - The cat's gone? Not my cat! Wait a minute, it's not. - It's really gone, darling? - Yes. Let's go and find out. I'm sure it's in the flat, it's not gone. - It better not be true! - We're going to have a look. So, not there... - I'm not sure it's gone actually. - Boo! Boo! I think he's in here. Alright, OK. He's in here. - Boo! - Boo. I'm gonna fucking lose it. Calm down, the police are coming. Don't go in there, stay out here. I don't want any more trouble. This is a piss take, Jack! A freaking piss take. We'll sort it out, alright. I don't need any more trouble. We looked in that drawer, it's not there. I don't know where to look. Where is he? Here, kitty, kitty, kitty! Jojo, is the cat there? Did you see it? Jojo, can you see anything? I'm gonna go and get Chucky, he'll sniff him out. We'll be back in a minute. Come on, Phoebe. Right. Let's do that. So, who's Chucky? That's their pit bull. I've nothing to say. - Jojo... - Here, kitty, kitty, kitty! Hide in your room. Goldie... Close the door and stay there. C'mon, Chucky, c'mon darling, let's see if we can find Boo. Get him out here. Allright, OK. In here, love? Yes, if you can... You see Boo? Where's Boo? Where's Boo, our cat, gone, hey? Why? Find Boo, go on, Chucky! What can you see, Chucky? What can you see? There's something going on up there. You can see there's nothing there. I can see that, but... Why would he be like that? - Something's going on, isn't it? - What is it? I don't know. Oh, my God! Oh my God, why is he barking? I don't know, we need to check. Something's going on up there. - Right, Chucky! - Can I go? What is it, darling, let me see. - There is a... - What? - What's there? - Is Boo there? There is a freaking hole behind the boiler, Vlado. Well done, Chucky! Is it Boo? Yes, it is. Get your arm in, have a go, love. - The boiler. - It's really, really deep, actually. Goldie, come here! Wait a minute. - C'mon, c'mon. - Grab him by the neck! I'm trying. Come on, darling. Grab him by the back of the neck. - You can't get him? - Let me try and get him. Let Phoebe have a go. I think we've got a problem, Vladimir. C'mon, Boo. Boo! Come out, Boo. Boo, come out. Boo! He's not Boo, he's Goldie. No, he's Boo, he's my cat. He doesn't have another name. He's not gonna come. It's not coming, Phoebe? Because he's using his claws. If he won't come for Phoebe, he won't come for anybody. - Come on, Boo! - No. Come on, Phoebe, come down again. He will come down in his good time. You tried your best. He just doesn't want to come out. - But I want my cat! - And how you gonna get it? And he will be happy when he comes out and sees you properly. What a shock, hey. I think he's gonna come out at some point. What we'll do, Irina we'll come and have another look tomorrow. We'll get him out, don't worry. But he's not doing any harm. - Yeah, I know... - You know... I think the cat had a spoon... ...in the mouth and dug there... Yes, yeah... with the spoon a hole. - Really? - Yes. - And who told you that? - He. Your uncle dug a hole there or actually, didn't do the hole properly with the boiler man. They've scared their own cat so badly. Poor him. He's probably still frightened. I'll leave food here by this little hole. What little hole, brother? This is an architectural wonder behind my boiler! What have you and Ian created? Such a shitty job. Listen now. Listen to what? - Ian is not a brick-layer. - Then what is he? Ian is a plumber or something. Besides, the old boiler was much bigger and it fitted further inside the wall. - This one doesn't! - This doesn't... - No one's going to climb up there... - This doesn't matter! ...to check is there a hole or not. Just be glad the police didn't turn up, because then it would've been me in that hole to be left food there for the night. Why the hell did you put the cat litter here? We have to find a way. I can't believe there's no other way to find... Questions have been asked in Parliament. The Council is the Government and the Government will be taking itself to Court, and it can't do that. Any attempt to fight is just doomed. There must be some success stories, right? Somewhere... - Remember David Cameron's nanny? - It's true. She had about 20-25,000 to pay. She contested it, went to court, did the whole thing and ended up paying £160,000. And I think she lost her flat. This is David from 67. Pleased to meet you. I'm David from number 67. We're from 22. You know, a few years ago I had a flat in Hackney. I had squirrels in the roof that were everywhere. They destroyed the brickwork, the wiring, everything. I went to the Council, I explained the problem. They've sorted it out. They put a scaffolding up. - 13 months that scaffolding was up. - For squirrels! The work was so bad, I took photos, I took everything. I showed it to them and I got a compensation for it. The whole amount? Not the whole amount. It took a long time to get reimbursed. There was something, I'm a bit vague on this but we did query it and I think, but please don't quote me on this they did do a repair job but they didn't do it well and they didn't pick the right materials. They get the budget for the year. If they don't spend it they lose it, they can't put it to next year. That's what's ridiculous. They've got a set amount, it's got to be gone or they lose it. To compensate you for the problems. It's very hard to know what their plans are, but... This is Alma. Daniel. Daniel from 52. Hi, I'm Claire from 60. - Claire? - Claire. Camilla, 73. - We're from 22. - I remember you. We've met before. - Hi. - Hi. - And you're Roger. - Yes, I am indeed. At least we're not being knocked down. - That remains to be seen. - Well, not imminently. Repair seems the minimum they can put in place. I'm still for they want to knock us down. They could sell part of the freehold to some rogue or dodgy landlord who holds a freehold. We're on their list of places to knock down. They submitted that list. Agenda 20 or something like that. Essentially it gives guidelines for regenerating city areas, expensive inner-city areas. Gentrifying? Gentrifying, if you like, but it really means taking indigenous population - likes of you, me, social housing especially, and moving them out. You can't just march them out. You've got to give them incentives to move like high service charge costs or poor road development, inconveniences. - Urban cleansing? - Absolutely! Who is the boss, by the way? Irina. - You're the boss. - No, I'm just a foreigner here. I feel like a foreigner now. - Anyway, take care. - It's allright. - Thank you, David. - Why do you feel like a foreigner? I'm in the process of being stripped of my European citizenship. Brexit issue. I'm applying to become an Irish, actually. It won't make any difference. Brexit will give us a little bit of democracy. Well, I agree. If the Union had listened to Cameron, and given him a few... at least treated him with respect, showed that they were capable of flexibility... I voted to leave because of that. I believe in expansive identity. The thought of being trapped in Britishness is appalling. Trapped on our island, as we will be. I'm looking forward to becoming an Irish citizen actually throwing away my British citizenship. I don't think Brexit is the return to nationalism. This country's always been a multinational country. We've always been and remain an international country. We just want to take some of the decision-making process back. We've been in Europe for a long time. It hasn't been a successful project! - This will be part of a national debate. - Can I just say something? Let's say this block is built in 1950s and it wasn't when the EU was in as it is now. My question is, English people, Irish people, whoever was here built it, why they built balconies on the first floor, not on the last one? Why is this? They ran out of balconies. I think you should train English people as well... If you're on the top floor you've got a balcony in the roof. There were people living in that roof space. It's like a cathedral in there, it's huge. I think it was a bunch of Albanians, actually, and they were having open fires in there, camping. They eat squirrels anyway. I'll see your squirrels and raise you an Albanian. Don't tell David, don't say that to David. - No. - Oh, my God, this is insane. This building used to be something special... I've always thought it has the grace of an ocean liner. Really, the good ship Juniper house. If I want to sell this flat... I don't want to sell it. So what they can do about it? If it's true we're being knocked down. They'll do a compulsory purchase at market value. Not the actual price. Probably about half of what you can get if you sold it privately. Still if I refuse to leave the place - what, they can't do anything. They'll probably end up bricking you into your own flat. There's not much you can do. Seal you in. Like a cat in the wall. Goldie, kitty. Here, kitty, kitty! Goldie, why man? We can catch Sky TV. I'm a minicab driver. A taxi driver. - Time has just flown by. - Yeah... Time flies when you're having fun. I wish time flew in Bulgaria... and not just other places. Yes, not just elsewhere. When you get... a moment's break... Yes, I've already got a holiday planned. Be careful here. Be careful. Be careful, there is a ladder. Yeah? You're good to go, yeah? Be careful. Hello? No, no, they've come home. Yeah. - Mother. - Have you finished? Yep, no more work for today. Channel 11916. Hi, Irina. Thanks for coming. Come in. Yeah, alright, Chucky, pack it up! Don't worry about the dog, come through. Yes, allright, Chucky! Come through, come through. - Make yourself at home! - Thank you. Still behind the boiler, is he? - Yes, he is. - Oh, dear. Would you like a cup? - Sorry? - Would you like a cup? - No, thanks. - No? No, I'm fine. Would you like one? No. Not today. I'll use it for medical purposes. Pain relief. See, I suffer from severe depression and I can't get out of bed in the morning for tears. You know that adventure playground at the bottom of the street? We go there with the little one. He loves it. You better keep your eyes peeled. Why? Six boys took turns with Phoebe in that park. And that was just the beginning. Did it for months and I didn't suspect a thing. At that time, I was trying to stop her father from leaving us again. And how did you find out? - Sorry? - How did you find out about it? Well... I began worrying about her weight. She was gorging herself day and night and then having these fits. Fits? Jack was being a pig. - Knocking us both about, regularly. - What? And then he came to live here with that woman and the baby. We could say nothing. What you gonna do with Phoebe? Phoebe? I try to distract her. Enrolled her on an IT course. But that cat was her only joy. A present from her father. Give me one. - You want one? - Yes. Yeah, my pleasure. There you go. It's only a little one. Not very strong. Three or four more toys to arrange... There's no more room. Boo, come out! Hello. Good evening. Mister Goldie Ginger please appear now! Sorry. If you give him wine, he won't drink it. This isn't wine. This is lemonade, made out of grapes. Wait a minute. Did he fall asleep? What's going on? Nothing. He's fallen asleep. Do you see a cat? Come and see. Oh my God! - What? - That is amazing? What? You're a big boy! Do you see the violets? - Yes, I see him. - What did he tell you? That he won't come out. Why? He's turned into a dog. South East Peckham rescue. What's your emergency? Yes, it's about the cat I've got in the wall behind my boiler. This cat is gonna die. Probably it's dead actually! Your pet will come out of its own accord. No, I'm sorry, but I need somebody urgent. It's an emergency! Can somebody come urgently? We're not sending services out today in this snow. I know it's snowing, darling, it's not a real snow there, is it? It's just some flakes. Do you know what snow is? I'm sorry, are you telling me... I need you to calm down, madam. Ok, I'm just gonna calm down and I'm just gonna ask you. Are you telling me, because of the snow, the whole country is now... As I have explained madam we're working with reduced services... It's gonna collapse, isn't it? Because of the freaking snow outside! That means the police is not able to come, that means the fire people are not able to come and save other people dying! Do you know what's happening now? If somebody's stuck in their house, not able to come out because of the fire they're gonna die. Is that what you are telling me? No, you listen to me, lady! Now listen to me! Because of this freaking snow, you're telling me somebody's fucking shot in the head outside, nobody's able to come and save them, is it? And somebody's raping somebody at the moment in the fucking park and because of this freaking snow you're not able to move! Is that what's happening in this country? I need you to calm down. No, I'm gonna calm down, if you calm down! For fuck's sake! Let's plug the hole, because I can't let him go! Here, here, here... Goldie! Give me a tissue. I'm sad too. There's no other way. Joe, you got a rubbish bin, mate? Quite fairly lights out, boys. Save the frame, same whites out. You look so worried. It's just such a good wood. It's shame that... You know, they could've left these ones. It's all about maintaining, that's what it is. But that's still working, the others maybe not. They haven't got around to painting them but they're too old, that's what they're saying. You'd never paint them, would you? Too high. That's what they're saying about them. It's not about painting, they were absolutely fine. For 30 years they've been here. And I don't understand why the Council is just wasting money. Uh. Just... We live in a bloody wasteful society. Go through it. Hit it. The same thing happened to my great granddad. After the Second World War, the Communists came and wrecked his house. You can't live in a nice house, if you're a true Communist. So are you also taking... Is it just going to be one window? Yeah, all this frame comes out, the whole lot comes out. I've got a new frame going back in. A nice new frame. Do you have the same frames at home? - Sorry? - Do you have the same frames at home? Yeah, yeah... You never knew him. Grandpa Doko. He's your great-great-grandfather. - Screwing away. - What? - Screw it. - Where? Hammer it in. You're too fast. I don't know what they're teaching in school, but you're too fast. - I tell you what. - What? I use the lift, you race me up the stairs. Whoever's first gets the chocolate in the fridge. Go! I won! Again - to the next floor. - I'm really sorry. - I should've known it was you! - I'm sorry, is the kid okay? - Yes, just fine. - We were just playing this stupid game. - I don't care! Sorry. Please, can I come to your place and stroke Goldie? It's Boo. No, he's golden. They don't live here anymore. They've been moved to Zone 6. Hopefully they'll do the same with you soon. We're the owners of the flat and we pay for all this. And to be honest, we can stay here as long as we fancy. Do you know where number 72 is? - That's me. - Rhianna Stevens? - Here Miss, this is for you. - Thank you. Hopefully, they'll get rid of you soon. And we can have some peace around here! We already gave you back the cat, why hold a grudge? How was work today? Not bad, but too much work for 35 pounds. I think I'll soon quit these antennas. I quit my job. And now what? Nothing. I realised I haven't fed my soul. And I haven't done any drawing for ages. So... Are you happy? Are you happy? I know you're not happy with that picture in front of you. I don't know, I'm too busy to actually... - Worry about it? - Yeah. To realise if I'm happy or not. I'm always happy. I think I'm happy now doing this... This is what's good for me. This bloke's been caught wanking out of his window. What a tosser! What's his name? All right! Here he comes. Did you forget your keys? Mr. Vladimir Tossoff? - Toshev. - Toshev, sorry. We run allegations from a neighbour of yours. We gave them back that cat a long time ago. It's nothing to do with a cat, Sir. What's going on? What are you doing? Mr. Toshev, we're arresting you for indecent behaviour. - You don't have to say anything... - That's ridiculous. ...but it may harm your defence... Excuse me, what's going on here? I'm his sister. Yeah, what's going on? - You understand what I'm saying. - No, I don't. What's going on? Excuse me, is this your child here? Jojo, go back to bed at once! Sit down. Look at the camera and answer clearly, do you understand? Sorry, we've been trying to call you for... Do you know how many days? Alright, Mister Tossoff... What? Toshev. Sorry, Mr. Toshev, we've had a complaint from a neighbour across the way, Rhianna Stevens. That's what we've been trying to call you for. I told them so. Yeah, this bloody cat, isn't it? You've been accused of aggressive explicit behaviour. What a nonsense! She's grassed me for the cat. We've just argued a little bit for the stupid cat. - It's nothing to do with a cat. - What is it about? In this country it's a very serious offence. More serious in fact, he can go to prison for this. We just found their cat, we gave it back to them, we argued a little bit. You should be getting on with all the crimes out there, really. This is Peckham, man. Everybody's going out naked in this place. It's full of perverts out there and she probably is one of them, anyway. It's full of idiots out there exposing or whatever they're doing, raping children and stuff, you know. - Can you be quiet, please? - Yeah. My colleague here is gonna ask Mr. Tossoff, Toshov, sorry, sir, some questions. Be quiet please. Sir, where was you between the hours of 9 AM and 11 AM this morning? I was at home. - Do you work, sir? - Yes. What do you do? I install TV aerials here but I'm a historian. He's a historian. Sorry. You wouldn't be installing aerials in the evening, would you, sir? No. Where was you on Tuesday, the 21st, in the evening? I can't remember. - You can't remember, you're sure? - I can't remember. And I still don't understand what I'm accused of. What am I being accused of? Just, let me... - They are accusing you of exhibitionism. - What? That you flashed your dick to the neighbour... Bullshit! Tell them it's because of the cat! I already told them a thousand times it's because of the cat. Yes? Keep in English or I'll do you for obstruction! Sorry. If you speak in a foreign language again, I'll arrest you for perverting the course of justice. It's a very serious offence as well. In this country this man is gonna go down. We gonna question him about it. No, but that is ridiculous because this is not true. You've got the wrong man, this is ridiculous. Or she's a liar because it's full of idiots like that... Someone might get killed while you waste your time here! We understand this. Ma'am, can you be quiet, please? We're gonna take you down to the station where you'll have further questioning. You can't take this man out of here. You have no evidence. This is an innocent man, academic first of all... We take him down to the station... You can't take him out like this. You don't have any evidence. - We'll take him to the detention centre. - What do you mean detention centre? He'll be questioned by the detention officer and will be held over. This is an intelligent man. We're European citizens! You're treating us like garbage! We have the right to stay here as European citizens, we're not bloody refugees. Jojo... C'mon, we're going to bed. Take it easy. I want to know if uncle is alright? He's alright. Nothing's wrong. Where did these policemen take him? I will sort it out. Sleep now. Sleep now. What is he doing? - Who? - Goldie. - Goldie? - Yes. He's probably chasing mice. He is a cat and they chase mice in the dark. I've not even seen a mouse in my life. - Never? - Never. And I've not seen a dolphin either. A dolphin? And even... And even... I haven't seen a dolphin either. Let's sleep now.
