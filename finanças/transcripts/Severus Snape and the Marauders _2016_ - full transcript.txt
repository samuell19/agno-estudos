Oy, have I seen your I.D.? Obliviate Oy, have I seen your I.D.? Obliviate Difficult day? Let me get you another one. Yeah, what do you care? I enjoy a good story. Trust me it's nothing special. Try me. There's no more owls or N.E.W.T.S or Toads or flipping stupid choir! We're free, we have our whole lives ahead of us! Professor slughorn made a shrinking solution and made Amelia three feet tall. Are you going to the party tonight, then? Remus? I think, well... You should be The answer is yes. With Mary, right? How'd you find out about that? Have you not seen the letters? We've all seen the letters. We assumed you did. They're not letters! They keep sliding under our door. No, they're love letters. They're howlers. (laughing) You'll take Mary, you're going to take Regulus No Regulus has another date with Slughorn, I'm sure. And Peter, who are you taking? I think I'm going to go Stag for once. Oh wow. You gonna take your shirt... if you changed your shirt... I like it. I'm trying to be honest. It's terrible. It suits me. Put a vest over it. Vests are in. I hear girls are warm too, just so you know. Yeah, warmer than vests. Almost. You alright, mate? Yeah. You don''t look so good. Favorite time of the month's coming up. Oh come on, that's not for three more days. We've got our routine down. Yeah don't worry about that now. We are here to celebrate! Hogwarts no more! That's right, cheers. We can finally ditch those dingy robes and sport something a little more respectable for the order. Just a bit of a chore is all. Yeah, we got you covered, mate. So where's Lily? Not like her to be late. Oh she'll be around. It's her favorite pub. Finally warming up to you, eh? Reckon you'll be settling in with a mini Potter? No, not likely. But, she um... I don't know. She made me see things different. Like maybe there's more to life than Quidditch and map building, I suppose. Is not! Best thing we ever did was making that map. Reckon it will make us legends. And that map wouldn't be anything without me. Yeah so you won't stop saying. I imagine things are gonna change. Yeah sure I mean everyone's gonna go their own way and get jobs but we'll stay together. I don't mean it like that. I mean with what's coming. Some might fight with us. Some might get killed. Some might fight against us. People we went to school with facing us on some battlefield. All I know is, we're not going anywhere. And not one Death Eater's gonna have a row at us, so long as we're together. But what if it's a friend facing us? Someone under the imperius curse Or worse, someone who wants to be there. Someone like- -Snape Exactly. No, I mean, he's right there. What do you think he's doing here? I reckon I know. You wanna have a go at him? What?! No... Are you serious? No, you're Sirius. Come on, we're not gonna see him again anways. Are you mad?! Right here in the pub? No. We'll take him elsewhere. Come on, James... Yeah I'm all for a row while we're in school but, I don't think they've got shared cells in Azkaban. Look you said it yourself, we're all going our own way Which way do you think he's gonna go? Slimy git does like to chum with my cousin. Yeah, so lets take care of him now. We're not gonna kill him! And beating him up is only gonna piss him off worse. Look, after what you did Oh what I did?! Oh when I save him from you after he went sneaking about. Can't we just enjoy our drinks? This isn't about Snape and Lily, is it? No! Of course it isn't. If that's why you want to start trouble... Look we need to make sure he fears us when the time comes. I'm gonna do it. Do you understand? Now what about the rest of you? You know I've got your back, mate. Peter? He's known more curses since his first year than any of us do now. We'll be fine as long as we're together. Right. As long as we're all together. Remus? It's a real risk, James. Yeah. We're used to taking real risks. We're not gonna hurt him. We're just gonna scare him. Of course we are! Come on, come on! Alright Snivelus, watcha doing here? Nothing. Don't look like nothing, are you trying to get a drink? Oy, have you seen his ID? What do you want? You're not welcome here. I'm minding my own business. It's a shame that I mind it too. Leave me alone. Come on, Snape. Give me an excuse. Come on! Do you see this bloke? He's a slytherin, recently graduated. You best stay on your guard around him. You all take it outside or I'll have the lot of ya splinched! Four against one. Very brave. Oh I don't need them, they're just spectating. She'll never forgive you, you know that? I reckon that's why you're here. Try and mend things after what you called her. A mudblood! Should have called someone else a werewolf. Or perhaps the ministry would like to know! Remus: James! This is going too far. Out of here, the lot of you, now! Fine. I'll give you what you want. But not here. I know the perfect place. Gentlemen? Come on, then. James! Still not bloody used to that... I'm quite fond of this spot. Lily loves to snog here. I'll make you a deal, Snivvey. If you beat me, I'll stay away from Lily. but if I beat you, you stay away from Lily for the rest of your life. She's not some prize to be won. Then you forefeit. That's fine by me. Come on, Snivvey! Give me a good one, right to the jaw. Come on! No? Sneaky. JAMES! Expelliarmus! He said he could handle it! He's already lost the match. He's gonna kill him! Remus: Snape! Sirius, Stop! Bloody hell... Peter, get in here! Peter, now! Ready? Together! FIENDFYRE!!! Fan out. Legilimen Having fun yet? He's a bit tougher than we expected, I'll give him that. Right you get him on the right, I'll flank him on his front. On the count of three. One, two, three. Remus! Surround him! Snivvelus, Snape...Snivvelus Snape... JAMES: How'd the exam go, Snivvey? LILY: Leave him alone! SIRIUS: What are you gonna do, Snivellus? Wipe your nose on us? LILY: What's he done to you? SIRIUS: I was watching, his nose was all over the parchment. LILY: Fine. I won't bother. JAMES: It's more the fact that he exists. LILY: I can't pretend anymore. You've chosen your way... LILY: And I've chosen mine. CRUCIO! SECTUM SEMPRA! Right. Well I guess we know who the big cheese is here I, um can...appreciate... a good wizard, with the right talents... Perhaps, I could... Learn. from a strong wizard, such as yourself. Alright, Severus! Alright. It's Severus now, is it? Just, please... Severus, please. Severus, please. Please what? PLEASE WHAT?! Please spare you? Is that what you want, Potter? You think you can hex and curse me all these years, Take away the one person that I ever cared about then you think that you can just brush me off? You have no idea what it is like to be me. You have no idea what it is like to lose something! You're right. Alright? I'm sorry. You're sorry. You're sorry! Now that I've bloodied you up! Now that you fear me. Well don't worry, Potter. It won't last much longer. No, Severus, don't. Goodbye, Potter. Severus, Please! AVADA KA- Have you gone mad?! What are you all doing?! Lily, I... You think that one last row would solve everything? and what were you... What have you done? WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?! I will never forgive you for this! You tell me what you've done. You tell me right now! JAMES: We started it. He came to the bar to see you, and we...tried to scare him off. You... All of you... What were you doing there? I just came to try to say- To say what?! To say that I'm sorry! I don't deserve to have you as a friend after what I called you. I know that. I've lived with it these past few years. You were my best friend and I ruined it. I ruined it after calling you that terrible name that I don't deserve to call anyone! I just came, to try to tell you how horrible I was, and how grateful I am that you were there for me when no one else was. I'll never bother you again, Lily. I hope that you can just... LILY: You still fancy the dark arts. And you still consort with people like Bellatrix. Show me, Severus. Show me, and I might forgive you. I hope to see you again. And that's all there is to it, really. Hmm... Well I imagine you did enough to keep them scared of you. Yeah. Well they won't be coming back to this pub again, anyway. I understand. I know what it feels like to be subjugated. For others to Fear you for your talents. Do you? I do. In fact, I think you have exactly what I'm looking for, Severus. What do you mean? For our ranks. What ranks? Who are you? You know who.
