He's going to meet his grandpa. How bad can it be? Surely that's more interesting than going fishing, right? Abby? Abby, you there? You alive? Yeah, I'm here. I thought the call dropped and someone went all Deliverance on you. - You there, Sash? - Yeah, I'm here. You sure you're okay? Abby? If I knew you were gonna be this nervous about it, I would've volunteered to come with you. Just a lot on my mind. I haven't told him. Well, he's definitely gonna know when he sees you get out of the car. Focus on the road and drive safe. All right? You're responsible for two now. That's true. Just let me know when you get there. So I don't stay up all night worrying. I mean, what's the worst that can happen? I piss him off and we don't talk for another five years. Hey, maybe we're over thinking this and it's gonna be fine. Just don't forget to call. All right. Love you, girl. Top of the hour, we have breaking news for our regional weather service. All counties from Bradford up to Washington County, prepare for incoming severe weather system. Snow, ice, hail and dangerously low temperatures that could... Abby? Abby! Abby? Oh my God. Abby. Oh, God, look at you. Oh, let me see. Let me see. Let me... You know, you look a little cold. Why don't we go inside? Thanks. Still drinking, I see. Yep. Helps me get through the days up here. What's in this? Why? Is something wrong? No. It's good. Then why would you want to know what's in it? Touche. You know, um, back home, you had other things to get you through the day. Job, music, friends... I have a lot of things up here. Plenty of things going on to keep me busy. Yeah. I can see that. I hunt my own food. People down in town, they pay me very well for the skins and any meat that I may not need. You sell skins? What, like it's 1865? I get by. It's not a way to make a living, Dad. I said... I get by. Seriously. What's in it? It wasn't like adorable and floofy, right? Well, I guess that depends on where a, uh, winter bunny, fits onto your adorable and floofy meter. - Dad! - It's okay. Look. This will make you feel better. He was not a nice bunny. I mean, he was an asshole. I don't know what he'd been up to, but he came hopping out of there after something really fast. Still laugh at your dad's dumb jokes. That's good. So... when are we gonna drop the small talk and talk about that. About what? Look, you sprung this on me. This... this "it". That's 'cause it's not an "it". It's my baby. Your grandchild. You just brought this in. I knew nothing about it. And we haven't seen each other for over five years. It's not my fault that we haven't seen each other for five years. Oh, yeah, you know what? Just drink up, okay? That's exactly why I came all the way up here to watch you do. This was a mistake. Who was it? What? Do you even know who the father was? Do you miss her? Every second of... ...every day. I hate how she was taken from us. And I hate that I messed up everything. No. No. Dad... Dad, she loved you. You were everything to her. You did everything you could, okay? You two were everything I ever wanted to find in somebody. Sorry. I'm so sorry. Okay. I didn't understand it then... but I do now. Okay? Hey, here, give me your hand. Here, feel it. There. Oh, God. Oh, God, it's kicking. It's... it's a boy. It's a boy. It's a boy. I was hoping if I came up here, I could convince you to come and find out what it is with me. No, I don't need to. No, we don't know to. It's a boy, it's a boy. Daddy. Oh, God. Ah, sweetheart. You know... you look so much like your mother. What are you doing? Sorry, sweets. I didn't mean to wake you. No, you didn't. I, um... I have to pee. In fact, I always have to be pee. You know, when your mom was pregnant having you, she couldn't go for an hour. I mean, poor woman told me that she hadn't had a good night's sleep in years. She only carried me for nine months, Dad. I think it had something to do with those terrible twos. - They went until you were... - Five? Twenty. Ah. Nearly forgot. Look what I found. Remember this? You kept this? Yep. I couldn't throw away my baby girl's favorite hobby. Favorite when I was a tomboy. Yeah, you all go through that, you know. I've been thinking. Maybe we could go up to the lake, rug up, and we could probably get some really good quality time together in. Like the old days. You and me. What do you say? Come on. What do you say? Sure. - Oh, one more thing. - Hmm. All those friends of yours on your telephone? Yeah. Think you can leave them here. Yes, Dad. Thank you, sweetie. Let's get this show on the road. Wait, wait. - You're driving. - What? Yup. Um... Ah, does it have a stick? Has the nubs. Oh, come on. A nub? Oh, please, God. You know... no matter how much I miss you, I really love this. Do you miss anything else? Yeah. Fast food. Aw, fast food? That's what you miss. A big, greasy, bacon, double cheeseburger... - Aw! - ...with mayo. Slide in an egg. Boy, that is so good, - that is so good. - Yeah. So you miss, like, heart attacks. Uh, what is it that you kids say? "Here for a good time, not for a long time." Who says that? I never said that. You know, I'm not going to die anytime soon. Especially not at the hands of a greasy beef... behemoth of a sandwich. Ugh, no. I'll stick with my salad. - Thank you very much. - Ugh. - Salads? - What's wrong with a salad? You ever had a Cobb salad? Oh, yeah. What's wrong with a salad? You know, I'm not a fan of the food my food eats. Okay? Okay, so your food eats Cobb salad? - Don't they? - No! Very smart rabbits. No, they do not, Dad. - Dad! Dad! - Oh!! Abs? Abby? Abby, you awake? Abs? Abby? You awake? Yeah, I guess. Sweetheart, I know it hurts. I Know it hurts. Don't touch it. Don't touch it. Let's just... Abby, listen to my voice. Come on, baby, listen to my voice. Abby? Listen to my voice. Come on, baby. Abby Jane! You've got to relax. Be calm and listen. Can you move? Come on, baby. Try. Could you move? The seat belt. The seat belt's locked. Seat belt! Jesus! All right, let's... Let's try to get some of this off you. Okay. Oh. I'm sorry, baby. I'm sorry. Okay. Okay. Listen to me. This is what we have to do. All right, you listening? We've got about two hours before sunset. Okay? When the sun goes down, it's going to get really, - really cold, really fast. - What? What? It's already really cold. I know, babe. I know. You're bleeding, and that's really bad. That's serious. But we've got to concentrate. We've got to figure out how to get at least one of us free. Do you understand me? Okay, okay. Abby, Abby, on the floor. Can you see the knife? It must have flown up here, when... when we hit that tree. Do you think you can reach it? Okay. Almost there. No! No! No, no, no, no... - Careful! - Dad! . It went under the seat. What... what are... what are you doing? Hold on. What's that? - We need to turn the car on. - What? Turn the car on. Okay. What are you doing? I hope this works. What are you... what are you trying to do? Hold on. Just hold on one second. - What? - Let me try this before I get your hopes up. Okay? Okay. - You've done it. - Okay. You've done it. - Come on. - Here. Your turn. Come on, you, come on. Come on, you. Okay Come on, you! Hang on. Hang on. Hang on. Just a minute, just a minute. - Oh, yeah. - What... what are you doing? I'm going to defeat this. Not gonna beat me. Just watch. - It's okay. - What... You! Dad! Oh, God. Get the out... Come on. Get out. Get... Okay. - Dad? - I'm okay. Just give me a minute. I'll come around to you. Dad? Dad. Come on. Dad. We've got a problem. I don't want you to panic. A little late for that, don't you think? Your side of the car that hit that tree? It's on the edge of the embankment. What? What? No. There's no safe way that I can open that door. If you try to crawl over this side to get out, you're going to carve yourself up. Sweetheart, you're losing a lot of blood, and that's really dangerous. And I can't allow you to do that. Not for you or for your baby. Can you see a walkie? What? - Yeah, I see it. - Good. Can you get it? Come on, babe. You can get it. Come on. Here. Here. Hello. Hello. Can anyone hear me? Hello, is anyone there? This is Grant Simpson. My pregnant daughter and I've had an accident. We slid off the road onto the embankment. She's trapped in the car about six miles from County Road 11. I need emergency medical assistance. Hey, Dad. I don't think anyone can hear you. Can you see the other walkie, Ab? Can you get it? Come on, baby, try. Come on, try. Come on. You can do it. Come on. - Check, check. - Yes. Yes. Check, check, check. Yes. All right. I'm going to leave for help. - What? - We've got a storm coming in. Now listen to me. Your body is probably having a really hard time keeping you warm. Your body goes under 95 degrees, you're going to go into hypothermia. You're starting to shake. It's already happening. Now you're going to get disoriented. You're not going to be able to talk. You're not going to know where you are, you're gonna lose your memory, then you start to hallucinate. God, if I can get to help, if I can get someone, something here before that happens, I can stop it. Do you understand? Do you understand me? Yeah. I understand. I understand. Please keep yourself warm. Okay? I love you. I'll never leave you. I'll never let you down. Not again, ever. Okay. Okay, baby. How do I get out of here? Reports from work. Useless. No. Heat. Heat. Okay, uh... Come on. Okay. Okay. All right. Okay. Okay, baby. You're gonna be okay. Okay, baby. How about some music? Dad, can you hear me? Are you there? I'm here. I'm here, Abs. Are you all right? I... I just wanted to make sure you're okay. Yeah. Possum. Can you not use the walkie unless it's an emergency, or you need something? I don't... I don't want to use all the battery. I... I understand. Okay. Over. Over. All right. All right, baby. Give... give mommy a second, um... Okay. Oh, God. Okay. Oh. Oh, gross. Oh! Okay, mummy's trying. Mummy's trying. I'm sorry, baby. Dad. You there? Dad, can you hear me? Dad. Probably just out of range. Yeah. That's what it is. He's getting help. Everything's fine, everything's fine. Probably getting help. But... but everything's fine. Please, Dad, please, please answer me. Are you there? Please! I'm having contractions. Please, please answer me. One, two...

Dad's coming back with help. Just gonna keep you warm, we can keep you alive. Keep you alive. Oh, my God. Okay, all right, this. Okay. Okay. One, two, three. Okay, okay. Oh,! Oh,! Okay. Dad. Dad, come in. Dad, my water broke. Dad, you said you wouldn't leave me. Please. Abby? Abby, you okay? What? Dad. I'm sorry. I can't understand you. You... Hello? Possum, if you can hear my voice... ...the storm's moving in very quickly. Make sure you keep yourself warm and your... The little one. Oh, God. What do I... Just know that I'm coming... as quick as I can with help. All right? I love you. Um... I love you so much. Okay, okay, okay. Okay, baby. This is gonna hurt. Just hang on there. Okay? Okay? Okay.
