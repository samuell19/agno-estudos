You shall not kill The events told in this film did really happen. The process described was held May 5 1949 at the Court Martial of Reuilly. "...everything can be rescued by peace, everything is lost by war." (Pius XII.) "...we make this admonishment ours, once again extending it on all those who are carrying, on their conscience, the heavy weight of responsibility public and known.. (John XXIII.) "Why do I still go to war" "after what I saw, with what I know?" "Where are the heros of war today?" "They have gone too far searching for the truth." "Every spring, the storks return." "And how often, with stout heart, I saw them passing by." "They cradle for me old reveries," "illusions of a child of whom nothing is left." "All the flowers died in the rifles of our fathers," "Cornflowers, corn poppies from a devastated garden." "By now I have understood what remains for me to be done," "don't count on me, when you start again." Last stop! All off! Last stop! All off! Adler! - AdIer! - Ja! - Adler! - Yes! Don't you know me, Stein? - What do you want from me? - Talk to you. And now. I don't have the time for this. I got interesting news. Take a look at today's newspaper The French are interested in the Piteaux story. What do you have there? Adler... Come over here. Read on. "All persons, in position to provide informations... ...on the German units and German military personal... ...involved in the assassination... ...of three French civilians at a Factory in Piteaux... ...executed August, 24 1944... ... are asked to... ... provide them to the French military administration in Meinz." What now? You understand? They call it murder. Ich know a bit about things like that. People have been shot for similiar events. Yes... shot Did you come to tell me this? I don't want you to be arrested. After four years you're putting some effort into me. We're both in the same situation, Adler! I'm waiting for you! Of course, you need money to get away. But I don't have any. But in your profession there's no unemployment. A priest... There's always money in that. Ask some of your prior. No. And apart from that you can't give me orders any more. My friend, a man like me will always give orders to a man like you. Where are we supposed to go? They will be searching for us all over and will find us everywhere. - No if I deal with it. - Feel free to leave without me. I won't leave you behind. I refuse. You can't count on me. So, what are you going to do? I don't know Don't get on the train. Come in. This gentleman has told me about a very severe affair... ...concerning you. Herr Adler, is it true? It's true... ... in whatever form he has told it to you. At the same time, I am hearing of the danger you're in. And this gentleman came, because he wants me to help you. - So what is it you want? - I'm broke. And I thought you could give me some money... ... and take care of Herr Adler to hide somewhere. I was thinking about that too. But right now, I believe neither Adler nor I would be safe. - But why? - The part about the money to get away, might work... ...but if I get caught by the French that's not going to help any of us. Without a doubt, I will be questioned... ...and you of all know, if they do that the right way... Yes, I see. But, what else? Yes, what else? You could do the same for me like for Herr Adler. What is that supposed to mean? There must be shelter for a threatened man... ... at some preceptory. - It has been done in France! - It's possible in Germany as well. But that is incredibly difficult, Herr Stein. That is incredibly difficult, but has to be done anyway... ... or there will be a bad ending. I don't care for it for quite some time now, so I won't guarantee for anything... ...Mr. Pastor, Mr. Abbot, Mr. Priest! You mustn't drive a man into full despair! You don't seem to understand properly... ...because you are living in another world! You don't feel any hunger! They are playing football here... You will only understand once one of yours is fallen into the hole. But then it will be too late. You surely don't want Adler arrested. I don't and you too. Thanks for this nice word. I see you got it. But as the French are on to us, as the newspaper shows. You can't pull things off too far. Believe me! Surely. Tomorrow everything will have been dealt with. Why tomorrow? Listen, Herr Stein. Things are not so easy. I have to get advice. Advice, advice... If I may offer you one... ... it would be to decide soon. Don't push, Herr Stein. I said tomorrow. - Tomorrow? - Tomorrow. - Fine, I'll be waiting here. - Herr Stein... If you want me to help you... ... it's not very clever to threaten me. Good. Let's leave it like that until tomorrow. But early. And no bad jokes. Understood? - This man is awful. - Yes, that's for sure. But that's not what this is about. Forgive me father, that I didn't tell you about it before. Do you believe I don't know everything about each one of, my sons? I only loved you more for it. Get up. You failed to trust in me. You will have to make up for this and leave everything to me. Everything. - Yes, father. - Do you want that? I want that. Good. As a French court is looking for you, I ask... ... you to surrender yourself out of your own free will. Now. You promised it to me. - Yes. - Good, my son. - But why? - Don't you understand? Let's find out together. So, why? Think about it. - Probably it's more honest. - Yes, it's surely more honest. But there is something else. It's better for our house, if I don't get caught in here. Sure. That would be embarrassing. And what else? Go on, let's see. But you're innocent. You did not do anything wrong, my son. But nevertheless... ... since when do you punish a soldier for carrying out an order. No court martial can sentence a man, much less a priest.... ... fulfilling his duty as a soldier. But if I get sentenced anyway? They don't dare.... They would fall in disgrace forever. Did we come to this, that in our unhappy country... ... the last remainders of christian culture is condemned? But calm yourself, my son. Have faith. You're wearing a habit that is protecting you... ... and you are the dearest of our sons. I will talk to our bishop. We will do everything, to ease your fate... ... until you return to us. - Get ready, my son. - That is fast done. No, you don't go in the habit of a priest. I understand. And you're right. The French police, please. Military police! The father prior. Come in. Officer, I entrust in your hands a honest man. Forward! - But sure, two years pass like nothing. - You better hurry to tell him so! We will see! - See you, boys! - See you. Better to go there in a bright mood. At least for 18 months we don't have to care for anything. It is consoling, you have to admit that. Bah! My Lord, what is happening? Don't you recognize me? No. - Maybe like this. - No, I assure you, you're wrong. - MimÃ¬! Don't you remember? You are Cordier, right? - No, no. Well, that is nice! Did you see the guy who just left. I'm sure he's called Cordier. So what? Am I not called Francon? Does he join the barracks too? Cordier! - Alright, you win, I am Cordier. - Why did you say you were not before? Are you angry with me. We were friends. - No, I'm not angry with you. - So is it? Aren't you content we're in the army together? You know, in there... you won't gain anything by knowing me. I didn't say that out of interest. But to have a friend! - We don't have the time to stay together. - How come? - I will be having a lot of trouble. - Did they already put you behind bars? Not yet, but I will end there. Mh?! - I don't want to be a soldier. - What? Look what a nice jacket with all those golden buttons. Say what you want, but they make us look really elegant. - We will look like mannequins. - We will look like loaded mules! You look good, with that helmet on! (Laughter) Oh, stop it! You will go away from here! Understood? Forward, out with you! Get out, out with you! The next four! One... Listen to me, don't do it. Wait until tomorrow. Who is after you? - What are you called? - Jean-FranÃ§ois Cordier. Cordier... Jean... ... FranÃ§ois. Which unit? Second battalion, third company. - Number? - 2535. A jacket. What's that? What is it, don't you like it? Go on, take it! Don't be silly! A nice jacket, I think. - It's nice, but I don't want it. - Sergeant Major! Here's one who doesn't want his jacket. Why, what's wrong about it? Nothing wrong with it, but I don't want to put it on. - You, what are you called? - Jean-FranÃ§ois Cordier. Fine, my name is Colombani. And I tell you one thing: this jacket is in perfect state. You'll take it and that's it! - No, Sergeant, I don't take it. - Sergeant Major! No, Sergeant Major, I don't take it. What a lunatic! Bring another one! You see? They're not bad. Don't ask for trouble! There you go, Sergeant Major. - I don't want any jacket. - God damn, what are you called. - Cordier, like before. - And what did you come here for? I was drafted. And now what? We have to dress you, don't we? - That's exactly what I don't want. - But why, god damn! Would be to long to explain. Take me to the Captain. To the Captain? So, you want to give me trouble, do you? What is that jacket, according to you? Come on, tell me! Pick one! It's not about the jacket. I want to talk to the Captain. Alright! I will send you there! You! - Goodbye, MimÃ¬. - Good luck! Take him there! What a guy.... Come on, hurry up! First corridor, then right! Hurry up! Move it! Move it, get up there! Come in! Captain, this recruit refuses to wear a uniform. - The Sergeant is sending him. - No, thanks... I have asked to talk to you, Captain. Go on. - What are you called? - Cordier Jean-FranÃ§ois. Well then, what is going on with you? Captain, I don't want to be a soldier. But you are already, my dear. This is a barrack. - I won't put on a uniform. - Tell me why. You're healthy aren't you? - Yes. - So? Then maybe there's another reason. Did you get ill, after the examination? No, Captain. I'm alright. Come in! The barracking material for the second battalion. - We talk about that later. - I don't want to disturb you, Captain. You must be very busy, I can wait. We talk about it later, go. I'm here. Let me hear you out. Captain,... ... I'm a conscientious objector. Conscientious objector... So, you could say... ... that your conscience is forbidding you to serve your country. No, it doesn't forbid me to serve it, but to go to war. Yes, I understand, I understand. Your conscience does not allow you to kill. Yes. For religious motives? Of course. Protestant? No, Captain, catholic. Listen to me, sonny: I am catholic too, and a believing one. Nevertheless I took a rifle and killed people. Yes, but I don't want to kill anybody. Yes, I understand. You don't like firearms. - Carbines, no. Sporting guns, yes. - So you kill animals? If I get you right... - It's different from killing a human being. - Sure, sure. That's natural. Alright. Seeing that you have a aversion against weapons of war, I want to make a proposal. Are you a graduate? - Yes, Captain. - So I take you as a secretary. You will have to deal only with paper. You won't be touching a weapon. Is that alright with you? Thank you, Captain, but I'm not looking for sinecure. I'm not offering you a sinecure, there's work here, you will be useful to me Exactly. I don't want to be useful, in any way. Well, my dear, things are changing. If you think you can go around annoying me, you're completely wrong. You will regret it! I'm sorry to bother you. I have nothing against you, Captain. I hope you won't force me to imprison you! - I don't force you to do anything. - And your parents? Do you have a father, a mother? Yes. And did you think about the pain you're causing them this way? About all the trouble they will have because of you? I assure you, I will slapp you! Don't you understand, idiot, that I am talking to you like a father Thank you very much. So... Will you be reasonable? Alright! Remember, that's how you wanted it. - Bonnet! - Sir, yes Sir! - Captain. - Put this man under arrest. Hello? Give me the Colonel. Hey, where you're going? You open the door and I walk out, right? In you go. False alarm! I bring you a real champion. Arrived at 9, in arrest at 10! World record! And his ration, Corporal? One spoon and a fork! - Cookware with lid, spoon and fork. - For whom? Cordier again? - Damn him! - Damn! It will be difficult to to keep him off, this one. I told him so! Take it. You brought him the cookware, but there was no lid for him. You will manage! Give him yours! You! Give me your cookware. Come on, give it to me! Come on... Go ahead... No, I don't care if this one doesn't want to be a soldier! This is a nice idea. So, why didn't you do like him? - Because I didn't think of it. - You're still in time. No, I don't think so. Cheer up, friend, and keep up your moral. There's not even bread. - Cordier! - Yes? Get your stuff. Come on! - Where do you bring me? - Solitary cell. They want to make me pass as crazy now?! - We're in a hospital! - If you're behaving like this it's even worse. - But you can't bring me there. - Get moving! Want us to get you there by force? Come on, walk! I don't have anything to do with these crazy people! - Don't scream, moron! There are sick ones around. - Leave me! I told you to leave me! Leave me, I told you! Silence! What the hell is this? What's going on here?! Major... - ...this is Cordier. - So, this is Cordier. Yes, Sir. Major, they brought me here by force. I protest. - And I tell you I am not crazy. - No one said so. - But I thought, bringing me here... - You think too much, boy. Take care of him. Solitary cell? No. Cordier! If you want to see your parents they're in the hall. Today's not visitor's day. They will have all the time to set your head right. (Laughter) If I were your father... I'm so scared! What a silly! Papa! - So you're not angry? - Angry? Why? I think it is very good, what you have done. - What, you don't dislike it? - I ask you why you didn't tell us before. If I had known! But see! I'm really happy you're agreeing with me. If you knew, how happy you make me! And I tell you, you will be home for Christmas. - For Christmas. Come on, mom... - Sure, you will see. For Christmas. - But they won't let me leave like that. - But sure, I assure you. I know it. They will discharge you. Well, you exaggerate. But, sure, it's possible. - But I'm not ill. - But yes, yes... Don't you remember? Like they told us? - 'Psychological unfitness'. - See! Psychological unfitness... This is what they came up with. - I am not crazy. - Why, are you not satisfied? No, I am not, no... That is... I don't know yet. I thought it would be more difficult. - You can tell them you resolved it. - You can never say this. But you did. If the let you go... Right now, I assure you, I am very well. You mustn't upset them. Stay good and be reasonable. Reasonable? They don't give me to much of a choice. Psychological unfitness... Now I understand why the made me stay in here. Ah, yes... yes, sure. But... but who told you so? - Your Captain. - Yes, your captain. He himself. But no, my dear! No, no. Don't have any illusions. It's not as simple as you think. However, my advice, if you allow me, would be to discharge him. Sorry, Captain,... ...but this is a medical question, so this does not concern you. Excuse me, Major,... ... but what Cordier did concerns all of us. You understand, of course. And it puts me in a deliate position... ... that may even bring some developments, dangerous ones. - What do I tell the Colonel? - Ah, the Colonel. I forgot about that. Well, tell him that I have shown you a nice locomotive. Do you have a little child? No, it's the Christmas-gift for the son of my concierge. What did you say about the Colonel? I will tell him confidentially.. ... that it would spare us a lot if the affair would be put away silently. Settling everything without noise. Oh, yes, of course. I see. - And the best way is that I discharge him. - Exactly. And who takes the responsibility to declare him crazy? The Colonel or me? Come on, crazy... That would be too good. We don't ask as much. You will admit, however, that the boy is not normal. No, I don't admit nothing. If you insist, I'd even tell you... ... if there aren't any new developments for me he is perfectly normal. And how. I don't want to use too big words as well but... ... we think that the interest of the army... Listen Captain... ...I assure you, that the interest of the army... ... is to have responsable physicians too. And believe me, Captain: this boy knows pretty good, what he does... ... and the risk he's taking. But we too. Bring me Cordier. And you? What do you want for Christmas? For Christmas? Because I... I could make you a nice gift... The discharge. What a face you make! Doesn't that make you happy? - I didn't say anything. - What more do you want. You return to be civilian. No more military service. No more guns, you understand? Yes, I understand. So, do I discharge you? Major... ... what do you want me to say? One day they lock me away, one day they throw me out, I did what I had to do. I am not the strongest one. Here I can write 'mentally healthy'... or 'crazy'. Yes, Major. At 'crazy', you are discharged. You're free. Yes, Major. At 'mentally healthy' you go to prison. Yes, Major. So? - What shall I write? - You need me to tell you? Crazy or mentally healthy? It's the army that has to decide, not me. The army would like you to be crazy. The physician doesn't think you are. - So... decide. - Not me, you. - But why. - Because it's you who are at stake. If I say that I am crazy, what I did, hasn't got any sense. Listen: it's not said, that you can fight against the war... ...only by making yourself thrown in prison. But if this is the only thing I think I can do... Think about it. There are 14 conscientious objectors in the army prisons, kept isolated. And nobody knows they're there. So? Yes, but they are there. And that's what counts. Ah, yes, of course. I forgot. Christian. So, what do I write? - Good. - Wait! Mentally healthy. Why don't you write? Take off your shirt! I am not ill. Unfortunately. If only you were! A bit meagre, the christian! They didn't discharge the other conscientious objectors Say 33. 33. 33. 33. - 33. - Enough. Now breathe. Stop breathing. Turn around. Say 33. 33. 33. 33. You understand, Major? I don't want to be discharged, I don't want to because... otherwise I... I, I... always I! You know what you are? A stubborn boy full of presumption,... who was never taken serious by anybody. But all of a sudden he insists, this moron, and everybody orgasms. He wants to revolutionize the army. The Colonel can't sleep anymore... ... and he's getting on the nerves of a nice man like me too! I am sorry, Major. Mr. smarty-pants who finally succeeded to be heard by the big ones. A nice success! Cough... - But I... - Will you stay quit? Stop breathing. Redress, there's nothing. What a hard head! Well, well. This means you'll end in the cold. Prepare your stuff. Tomorrow you return to the barracks. - Here's your letter of dismissal. - Thanks. It has went up in smoke, eh, the hope of being discharged? Eh, yes, Sergeant. It's gone up in smoke. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Goodbye. No! If you want to know, for me, he who won't be a soldier is a coward! Why? After all, with what he has done.... ... he has proved courageous. And I... I hold out my hand. Courageous! Yes! Courageous?! Come on, don't make me laugh! What did he risk? They don't shoot him. He wouldn't have made it anyway, at the frontline. No, he's right. And this doesn't serve for nothing. If at least everybody would be like you, then something might come of it. But in the end you will be alone, to regret it. No, you will see. I tell you it will serve for something. And what we did, doesn't serve for anything?! - No. - Coward! Have I lost an arm to have a sleazebag like you come tell me... - ... that it is useless? - You at least don't want to hit him, right? Get off! Back off, you nuisance! And return the sheets! I'm not your chambermaid! A packet of Gitane, please. There you are. The Colonel is coming! Form up the guard! Guard, attention! Present arms! Order arms. At ease. Break up the lines! - But I know you. Aren't you Cordier? - Yes. So, you're healthy again? No. - You are Cordier? - Yes. - Stay here and don't move. Francon! - Yes? Oh! Run! - And he came here alone?! - Yes, sure. Like a nice boy. Oh, Lord! Oh, God, God... Hey, FranÃ§ois! What's happening? Boys, come here, I tell you the latest. Listen good... Cordier! Forward march! Commando, stop! Soldier Cordier, if you insist in your behavior... ... you put yourself in a very grave situation. You know what expects you? Colonel,... ...whatever the precaution regarding me may be... ... I absolutely cannot fall back behind my decision. Soldier Cordier, do you want to put on this uniform? No, Colonel. For the second time: do you want to put on this uniform? No, Colonel. For the third time: Soldier Cordier, do you want to put on this uniform? No, Colonel. Gentlemen, you are witnesses, the delict has been committed. I will read what the laws of military justice provide for cases like this. 'Article 205:... the soldier who refuses to obey, or who, except in cases of force majeure... does not follow the given order... ... is punished with a prison sentence of one until two years. So, this makes you laugh, what? I'm sorry, Colonel, but two years of prison... I thought I was risking much more. But don' think that after these two years if you insist in refusing... ...there will be another two. And so, from years to two years, forever! Bring this man back to prison! - Shower! - Shower! - Shower! - Shower! Shower! Take mine. (with German accent) Thank you very much. - You are French? - Yes. How come you are among us Germans? For the French I am contagious. Morally contagious! Silence! Forward, the cold water! What does 'morally contagious' mean? I didn't want to be a soldier. - A deserter! - No. Why did you refuse to be a soldier? Because I am a christian. - Did they give you something to eat? - No, nothing. I'm sorry. I don't have anything either. Maybe later. Now, do you want a cigarette? It's forbidden to give away cigarettes! If you would be out on road patrol like us... ... instead of daubing paper in the office, you wouldn't be offering cigarettes to these bounders... ... who shoot us from behind . I know as well as you do what is forbidden and what allowed. Away with the cigarettes! To the commandant! (Get going! And don't try to flee, or I will shoot you in the back.) Hurry up! Fast! Herr Major! The names of the three? That's the task of private Adler, Herr Major. But he is much more concerned giving away cigarettes and sweets... ... this bible-reader. Take this suitcase down and the small one too. I don't know if there's still space left in the car. So put the small one next to me, and put the other one in the back. Keep down the noise. These papers have to be burned anyways! But these are the names. This should have been done long before! - Poitier! - Present. - Leblos! - Present. - ErcIos! - Present. You have been caught by the patrol. Two of you have been armed with pistols. The third one, with granades. This is right, no? Do you have anything to say? You know the laws of war. A civilian caught with weapons in hand is sentenced to death. There is no regular court around here to sentence you. But I take the responsibility as it is my right. - Stein! - Yes, Herr Major! Execute the sentence! Form a execution squad. Sir, yes, Sir, Herr Major. You! Heinrich! You! Bohlermann! Off! And you... Adler. - Me? Why me? - Why of all men not you? Do you think the others enjoy doing it? Please, Herr Major, I plead you, to not give me that task! Just because you are a priest? You are wrong, mein Herr. Here we know no cowls! Here we know only uniforms! Herr Major, I repeat private Adler! This private is a cry-baby. He has to be taught to behave like a man! I... I refuse. Adler! I don't want to have heard, what you just said. - Yes, Herr Major. - Good. Unfortunately... But that is war! Private Adler... This one! Adler! What are you waiting for?! You have three minutes. If you want to I can inform your families. Yes. Thanks. The address. Yes. Eure de Loupe 66, Rue... Rue... ... Lepic. Rue Lepic. Thank you. - Are you catholic? - Yes. Do you want to pray together? If you want. Do you know the Pater Noster? Yes, sure. Yes. - Pater noster qui es in coeIis... - Our Father who art in heaven,... - ... sanctificetur nomen tuum... - ... hallowed be thy name. - ... adveniat regnum tuum... - ... Thy kingdom come... - ... fiat voIuntas tua... - ... Thy will be done... - ... sicut in coeIo et in terra... - ... on earth as it is in heaven... ...Panem nostrum quotidianum da nobis hodie... ...Give us this day our daily bread,... - ... et dimitte nobis debita nostra... - ... and forgive us our trespasses,... ... sicut et nos dimittimus debitoribus nostris... ... as we forgive those who trespass against us,... - ... et ne nos inducas in tentationem... - ... and lead us not into temptation,... Fast! Hurry up! ...sed Iibera nos a maIo. Get going, Adler! ... but deliver us from evil. Adler, hurry up! He wasn't yet dead! He wasn't yet dead! - Ite, missa est. - Everybody: Deo gratias. Benedicat vos omnipotens Deus, Pater et FiIius et Spiritus Sanctus. Amen. - Dominus vobiscum. - Et cum Spiritu tuo. - Initium sancti EvangeIii Secundum Ioannem. GIoria tibi, Domine. These are for the 70th birthday of the General. - How happy he will be! But is the gardener going to allow it? - Yes, I will talk to him. Okay, I didn't see anything. Try to hurry! Thanks a lot. Let's get together. Come on! Come on! Let's make a circle. Stand here. Do come closer! - General... - Yes, please? In the name... of all comrades... ... please take. My dear colleague! Thank you. Thank you. I will give them to him, the flowers, to this one. They didn't bring him flowers at Buchenwald. I don't smoke! Could you give me a light, please? Thanks. Thanks. - Would you want to smoke with us over there? - Why not? It's a real pity you won't be having time to get to know... Mr. Adler better, because they will set him free today. Oh, in freedom, General, no. I will be only expecting the day of my process in a convent. - And why? - Because Mr. Adler is innocent, my dear! Okay, okay. Don't get excited. And I will tell you more. Even if you are French, you will excuse me,... ... but it's a shame, that a man like him was arrested... ... in a French military prison! Adler has shot a terrorist during our retreat, that's right. It's an outrage! But I only did it to follow the orders of my superiors. I don't agree. One can always say no, to superiors. - Then they will shoot you. - Oh, they shoot you? Yes. - Shoot you... peng peng peng? - Yes. Peng peng peng peng! - So you can croak! - What? Please, he is an old man, a prisoner. - Any I am not a prisoner? - And he has even made the communion... Of course! Which is why I am more christian then you! You're wrong! You certainly aren't more christian than Mr. Adler! - And why is that? - Because he is a priest, Mister! Very good, General! This is a nice way to put it! Silence! Enough! So tell me: you think you can cause trouble in here too? Watch out what you are doing or I put you in the punishment cell! Forward, the walk is over! Stand in lines! Attention! Priest and soldier don't go together too well, General. Cordier, step forward! I warned you, you wanted it! Forward, in the punishment cell! Go! And you will stay there for some while. Where are you going? - Please can I visit him? - No, he is still in the punishment cell. Let's go. - I came to say goodbye. - Good. Perfect! Everything will work out for you, don't you think? The Assumptionist fathers will host me until my process. Very well, good. Don't you want to make me a great pleasure? I did deliver the mass, in here. Every sunday. - I shall take your place? - Yes. No. - But why? - I would have too much fear of being liberated... ... Mr Priest. - You don't have any sympathy. - For you, I don't. Hello. I am sorry, I want to see... ... my son, Jean-FranÃ§ois Cordier. Sign here. There you are. - I am sorry, I have a packet too. - Packets over there. Excuse me, I have a packet. No flowers. It's forbidden. No glasses. Please. Alright like that. Please sit down. They sure aren't happy, I assume. But how are we too? Mamma! - Mamma! Mamma! - Jean-FranÃ§ois! - My son! - Mamma! - My treasure! - I am losing weight, no? But no! Not too much. - I brought you a packet. - Good idea. - How is papa? - Very good. He said, he will come next time. It is a some journey, you know. - You didn't have any trouble because of me? - No, no, no. Everyone was very understanding. - It's not like in here. - What? - It's not like in here. - Ah, yes. - It's hard, no? - Well,... What is in the packet? Sheets, tobacco... Ah, and something to eat! Something to eat? Good, thank you. - They don't give you enough? - Yes, yes. It's not bad. You didn't write anymore. We feared you would have been punished. No, no. They are very wise. Oh, this... And then, here... ... they don't punish. I didn't write, because I didn't think of you. It's strange, you know, in prison, you don't think anymore. - You won't forget us, will you? - No! But I don't have no memory anymore. You know what I am trying to remember for eight days now? The name of the village where we ate so good in our holidays last year. - And it is? - I wish I knew. - But it wasn't Orcival? - No, a horrible place. - At Royat. - No. - At Issoire! - No! I don't know. Don't you remember. It was near Gergovie. Gergovie. This little town in Alvernia. Wait... The chicken in wine! Lamastre! Lamastre! Lamastre! The chicken in wine. You see? This is what you are thinking of in prison. Time is over. Time is over. Time is over. Time is over. Time is over. Time is over. - Bye mamma. - What do you want me to send? Whatever you want. - You have to go, Madam. - Yes, I understand. One moment! I forgot... I forget everything. Silly me! Your case will be discussed together with that of a German priest. - What? - A German priest who has killed. - Your lawyer is very satisfied. - It's time! Come on, let's go! You don't say anything, Jean-FranÃ§ois? Why don't you say anything? (Come, Madam. You have to go.) (Why don't you say anything?) (- Jean-FranÃ§ois!) - But yes, mamma. The German priest. Everything's fine, yes! Come, Madam, forward. Please, try to understand this. But I am not here to understand. Oh! - What are all these priests doing here? - They came for Jean-FranÃ§ois. What are you wondering about? After all it's also a religious problem. Yes, that too. Right. Like that it is alright. Till later. Mr. Adler, you are disgusting. - Even if I may be a criminal... - Criminal or not, I don't care. You, however, are a scoundrel. Herr Adler! Dear me, if I could, I would dress up as a monk. This specula on the soutane, but for me that doesn't help. They won't do anything to him. But no. They won't do anything to him. Out of respect for the habit and to snub me. They will absolve him. Just to show that in the world of today even a priest... .. has to kill his neighbor like everybody else. He is a good christian.... ... a good christian should do like his priest. Adler, raise! Do you have anything to add in your defense? Your honor,.. .. the act of which I am accused was ordered. As a man and a priest I have suffered from it and still am suffering. But as a soldier I have nothing to regret. Thank you, sit down, please. The debate is closed! Take the defendant out of the room. He speaks our language quite good. You will understand, with four years of occupation, they had time to learn it. Now the Cordier case. Cordier! Raise, will you? - You are Jean-FranÃ§ois Cordier? - Yes, your honor. - Born... - October 5 1927 at AlanÃ§on. - Name of your father? - Cordier Edouard. - Name of your mother? - Boulanger Louise. Currently you are doing military service... ... with the 48th regiment at the Magenta barracks. Hey?! Pay attention! Currently you are doing military service at the Magenta barracks? - They told me so. - Good. I give the word to the senior public prosecutor... ... to read us the accusation. Pay attention while it is read out to you. 'The French state, military court of the district of Paris... against Cordier Jean-FranÃ§ois,.. ..accused of disobedience according to the file... ... compiled by Colonel Du Pont, senior public prosecutor. The facts. September 5 1949, said Cordier Jean-FranÃ§ois,.. ..after presenting himself at the Magenta barracks to get drafted,.. ...has expressed his intention to not wear the uniform of the army. ... and did not accept what he was supposed to do.. The delinquent has visited the charter school... - Is there hope for Adler? - Everything went well. I hope for the best. - What did you say about AdIer? - That there are good expectations. - When will we know the sentence? - I don't know. I ask him When will we know the sentence of AdIer? - After this case. - I understand. - He says after this case. - Fine, so we wait. I won't. - What else can we do? - Nothing. ... put on record at the military court of Paris March 7 1950. Signed senior public prosecutor Colonel Du Pont. The defense has presented only one witness:... ... the Reverend father Roberre. Is father Roberre in the room? Present! Please sit down in the witnesses' room. - But who is he? - He's from the mission at Paris. A worker's priest! A worker's priest! - So I sign. - Me too. A worker's priest! You went to the to high school at the boarding school San Giuseppe. - It is a religious boarding school, right? - Right. With somewhat mediocre results, as it seems. The professors consider you to be a undisciplined, hairsplitting pupil,... ... who always wanted to be right. - Not always. Only when I was. - Good. I see that the fathers of the boarding school threw you out in 1943. Oh, no! It was me who went. And why? What did you blame your teachers for? For not being saints. No wonder. You are a rigid christian, we know that for sure. There are catholics and there are protestants. "You shall not kill...", "He who lives by the sword...", etc. Your honor, may I say something? Sure. You are free to say anything that may serve for your defense. Your honor, I want to know whether the fact if I am a christian or not... - ... is part of this process. - Sure. The court has to know your intentions to judge your acts. Let me explain better, your honor. Has this court the intention of condemning one christian... ... by using another christian? You are not her to ask questions! Your honor, I join the disapproval of the court... ... and ask my client to leave the task of his defense to me! Good, good, good. Like I said. Bravo, Jean-FranÃ§ois. Aren't you aware, that he is ruining himself? Not at all. I think he is defending himself very well. The more christian one of the two is certainly not the priest. - You make him understand. - He will make him understand Padre Roberre, you will see. In spite of your habit you are the Reverend father Roberre? - Yes, your honor. - The worker's priest? Priest, your honor. One takes off the habit while the other one puts it back on. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth? - Raise your right hand and say "I swear". - I swear. You know Jean-FranÃ§ois Cordier well? Yes. He worked with me in the Rue Charonne for almost two years. We deal will boys... who lost their way. A relief organization! Not exactly. Our institution was, more of a... The court understands full well. Let's not discuss words. Well... But what feelings may, according to you, Priest,... ... motivate the behavior of Jean FranÃ§ois Cordier? I am glad to express my thoughts. Jean-FranÃ§ois Cordier did confide himself spontaneously to the military authority,... ... and has remained serene, smiling for many months. I confirm that the Church is with him... A moment, Reverend. If you refer to the catholic church,... ... you have to admit, that it has been bellicose too,... ... at least in past centuries. And that it often has had to acknowledge the necessity to go to war. I know, your honor, to what you refer,... ... and know what you are reproaching the church with for certain reasons. But, as you will understand, I am here as a defense witness for Cordier. And for this reason I want to say something different... ... from what is very often said about the Church. And what you too have said, as I remember. On the problem of war, Reverend. - Without exceeding the point. - On the problem of war, nothing else. Don't be alarmed. I don't intend to speak of theology. It would neither be the moment, nor the place. On the problem of war. The Church has never approved of it. It has tolerated it, bore it. I quote the words of His holiness Pius XII: "...everything can be rescued by peace, everything is lost by war." And one of the closest collaborators of the Pope has added:... ... " The war has to be absolutely banned." "BeIIum est omnino interdicendum!" I am sorry, gentlemen, if I quoted the latin source. Absolutely banned! But sure, we figured as much! Latin for latin, my dear Reverend: "EccIesia abhorret a sanguine." "The Church has fear for the blood." These things are not new. And in any case, the text won't tell us, I hope, say... ... that the Church approves of conscientious objection. I ask your pardon, I want to finish, your... Commander... On this point, I may add, recently... ... a very important congress was held. Which one? By whom? By catholics, your honor. And all qualified. - I don't doubt that. - I beg your pardon. I want to state more precisely that those participating... ... were well prepared and distinguished persons from all over the world. In the course of this congress,... ... a motion was discussed too - listen well - ... ... that provides for those of sincere faith - the conscientious objection! You did not know that, did you? But it is like that. It is the message of this great catholic congress, that I bring to you, Jean FranÃ§ois. In '14 this should have been told the world. In '14 and in '39. - You say it today, and that's what counts. - Yes, you say it. And I say something else. One finds whatever you want in the Church. Yes, Jean-FranÃ§ois, in the Church there it is - everything. And it is without doubt that it is formed by man like you and me and you, gentlemen. But above these human beings, who may even contradict themselves... ...exist eternal principles of the common good... ... taught by the Church - infallibly. These principles aren't yours alone. Jean-FranÃ§ois, is this really you who speaks in that way? Yes, it is. Listen to me. I am very discontent they made you come here. I know that what I am goint to say, will sadden you, but I cannot anything about it. I do not want your help anymore. What now, dear Reverend? - Come on, Jean-FranÃ§ois! (I ask you not to insist.) (But you must be kidding!) You don't want to tell me, you are not a christian anymore?! - This is of my concern alone. - But what do you know about it? - You don't stop to be christian all of a sudden. - It can happen. But if I still am one it is against my will. Yes, exactly so. Good, so we don't use the religion for my defense. I ask you, don't even speak about it anymore. I am against war, because it is too stupid and senseless. God, let's not discomfort ourselves to show it! And if it is true, that he too is against war, he will say so! Once and for all! And please do listen! Jean-FranÃ§ois. Jean-FranÃ§ois! Silence! I don't understand. The word christian is on every page of your dossier. Did you change your mind? - Yes, your honor. - Ah, well... If things are like this, dear Reverend... And now, my dear, defend yourself a little. - If it not about religious motives, then maybe political ones? - No. - Are you or were you a member of a political party? - No, never. And the, as far as I know... ... no political party has ever forbidden to kill your neighbor. Excuse me? During the war or the occupation... - ... did you witness scenes that shocked you? - I wouldn't say so. But what religion do you have? Tell us! You don't want to make war? Neither make it, nor prepare it. In concIusion, you want to overthrow social order. But no, your honor, I want to overthrow nothing. An order, of course, if you want. I don't know which one. I don't deal with politics, I already told you so. I feel, that I too have a debt to absolve. With 20 years one does his military service, I don't. I am prepared to serve my country and maybe,... ... for a longer time and worse conditions that.... ... those of the military service, but not within the army, that's all. A civil service, obviously. The point is about carrying a gun. And who give you the right to this choice? I do. When you do presume the right to discuss the rights towards your country... ... you are already willing to overthrow everything! And if you have not even religious motives, which afterall... What is left? Only a rebellious individual, without breaks, without moral! You know what one like this is called? An anarchist! Anarchist, me? You see, I don't understand. I am supposed to be an anarchist because I hate war? - But everybody hates war. - But everybody makes it. And I know it, because everybody is making it. Out of desperation. Well, I am not a desperate. But it started bad of me too. I was ten, when the war broke out, and didn't understand too much about it. But I was fifteen when it finished. Already... enough to say. Because... Make it clear to yourself that for one of my age the war wasn't over. What do you want me, a young man, to do in a country, in which everybody, today... ... talks about nothing but war, thinks about nothing but war? Should I study? Learn a profession? Marry? Have children? Whatever you do, is useless fifteen years later because there is war, there always is. 250.000 deaths in one second... You cannot accept something like this to be happening. That's why there are so many thieves and murderers of my age. Girls and boys. You see... ... I consider myself fortunate to be able to act like this. At least I believe in something. I have more hope than all of you. I don't think, I know, that if people want to... ... they will succeed in having a world without murderers. During the occupation, confronted with the crimes of the enemy... ... did you feel solidarity with your compatriots? Yes. And you did not feel the need to fight for your country? To take a gun like all the others? - Yes. - And so? I was 13, your honor. - But now, your are not. - No, your honor. - I want to ask something. - Go ahead. If these are your ideas, why did you not desert? Because I am French, Colonel. Is there another question? Please. What do you intend to do when you will be released from prison? When I will be release from prison... ... and you will order me again to do military service... ... I hope I can still refuse. Thank you. You may sit down. The word has the senior public prosecutor to read the charges. For Jean-FranÃ§ois Cordier, who committed the deeds he is accused of... ... I ask the court to simply apply the law. You see? He did not insist. He did not rage at all. (The word has the defense!) First case: the Adler case. Gentlemen, you are asked to respond to the following question:... .. "Is Adler Rudolph guilty or not to have committed on August 24 1944... ..at Piteaux, an act against martial law?" I remind you that for a crime like this a penalty if provided... ... ranging from forced labor to the death penalty. To my impression, the true and only responsible for the events... ... is Major Karl Baumann... ... Commander in charge of the division to which Adler belonged. Major Baumann was shot in the last offensive at the Ardenne... ... and thus every action on his behalf is to be considered closed. Leaving us Adler, who deep down was only executing an order. Apart from that, the special personality of the defendant... ... should cause us a certain lenience. (No, sorry. The question is not that of lenience...) (... but only that of doing justice.) But that, Colonel, why did you appear in a robe... ... if it's only a question of justice? (I agree. He has done wrong.) Surely, Captain. But, priest or not, we don't judge a man. The man does not interest us. Let's re- member that we are here to judge an act. So let's say that his was an act of obedience. Exactly. And as things are to me I ask you to think twice. The sentence we are going to say will be of great effect. And especially today, Colonel. - Ah, and why? - Why... For no reason. Gentleman, do you think that a ballot is necessary? No, it would be useless. No. Agreed. So I will read you the question. "Is Adler Rudolph guilty or not to have committed on August 24 1944... ..at Piteaux, an act against martial law?" Who answers 'yes' raise your hand. Now, cross-check. No, unanimously. Adler Rudolph is unanimously absolved. The case of Cordier. "Is the soldier Cordier Jean-FranÃ§ois guilty or not of insubordination?" I remind you, gentleman, that the accused is facing a penalty... ... ranging from one to two years of imprisonment. If you will allow, your honor, but I have to say, it makes me feel uneasy ... to judge this boy directly after the German priest. And why is that? Why... because I wonder whether it wasn't out of intention.. ... to deal with these two cases in the same hearing. - Absolutely not. - There is absolutely no connection. If Cordier would have claimed religious motives, I'd understand. But seeing he refuses, and with what way, to invoke these... On the other hand, even if he would have, my position would be the same:... ... to judge, on the one hand, a christian who has followed obeyed... ... and on the other hand, one who disobeyed. - I am glad you put it like that. - The acts have been committed. The law is clear, and we are here to apply it. But the arguments of this Cordier are not lacking a certain coherence. Individually this may be the case, but socially they are very dangerous. It would be the end of the army. And maybe the society as a whole. And with of this? Maybe he has passed his time. This is the last thing I was expecting you to say. I gave it a lot of consideration before deciding, if I am granted the rights... ... to state the following. If you could start again, would you do the same? Yes, but this is not about starting again. I agree with Cordier... ... and, like him, I hope that the wrong is still curable. And you if you were willing... ... to grant certain individuals to stand apart with their conscience! But we are in times of peace, Colonel. That does not matter. Even if we were at war... ... I would judge the same way. Lieutenant, you have the right to express your opinion... ... but I remind you that who dares to discuss the law already violates it! And, above all, the conscientious objec- tion is something that will never exist! To even speak of it, acknowledges it, as you will admit. - Call it madness, mental defect... - No! I call it simply "insubordination"! An observation: if we condemn Cordier, his case... ... will be exposed to our judgement again after he is released from prison. So what? We risk to sentence him to lifelong imprisonment at small doses. It is he who will put us in the same situation. - Is it really for sure that it depends only on him? - Sure, why not? The force majeure is provided by military law, article 205, too. And what would, in this case the force majeure be, Major? The conscience, Colonel. Gentlemen, I think has been thoroughly debated... ... and hence we will come to the votes. - Yes. - Good. The ballot box, please. Thank you. I will reread you the question... "The district court of Paris... ... has taken file of the attached docu- ments and those of the interrogators... ... in accordance to the article 90 of military law... ... and has tried the following questions. 1st question: Is the soldier Cordier, Jean FranÃ§ois guilty or not of having... ... refused obedience to his superiors September 5 1949... ... who asked him to put on the provided uniform... ... and present himself for instructions? Second question: Did the above mentioned facts proof... ... to be justifiable?" The first question was - with the necessary majority - answered: yes. The second question was answered: no. The defendant Cordier Jean-FranÃ§ois is hence found guilty. Having reached this decision, the court has taken file... ... of what was exposed by the senior public prosecutor... ... and has deliberated the application of the penalty. In consequence, this court sentences Cordier Jean-FranÃ§ois.. ... to one year of imprisonment and the process costs... ... according to the military law. Order arms! I am sorry for you. No, he is not to be pitied. Next case: Antoine Chardonne! Madame, it seems we managed to get two votes in our favor. Isn't this a success? Can I see him? Well, we will try. Let's ask the sentry. It's the door over there. (Guard, have the defendant enter!) - What do you want, madam? - I want to see my son. - She is the mother of Cordier. - I'm sorry, that is not possible. - I know, but you will understand... - No, it's forbidden. - Do you allow to send him wishes. - That does not depend on me. Leave it be. - It is a question of one moment. - I told you I can't, don't insist. But it's absurd! Silence over there or I have the room cleared! Please continue. You will see him, when he comes out. They will bring him out shortly. I accompany you. (Indistinct dialogues in German) He has to pass by over there. He didn't come out yet, I see the van is still standing there. Poor woman! I pity her with my whole heart. It is a hard test, for her. Jean-FranÃ§ois! Mamma! Jean-FranÃ§ois! Jean-FranÃ§ois... Mamma... Mamma... Courage, my dear. Courage. You must not cry. You must not. Thank you, mamma, thank you. - Thank you. - Courage! Jean-FranÃ§ois... I am proud of you!
