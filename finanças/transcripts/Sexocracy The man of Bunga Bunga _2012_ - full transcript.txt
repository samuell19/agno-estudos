Lele Mora and I are long time friends. He has done an excellent job in Mediaset. I helped him in a period of economic difficulty In times of health problems And I am proud I've done it. And the minor denies she has never had sex with me. She introcuced herself as a 24 y.old girl As witnessed by several people. All the accusations againts Lele Mora Are completely baseless. And now is my turn to talk! During my life I hired thousands of people. Vallettopoli (showgirls scandal) destroyed me. Psychologically. I fell in depression I could not even work. And I thank the President for his help Which is much more than the 1.2 million as they say. This intrusion into citizens' private life Is against the law. Everybody asks me where I met Ruby. One evening by chance in Arcore. I did not take her there. She wanted to enter showbiz. [TG4 News Director Emilio Fede] "This 13 y.old Egyptian girl". "I was touched by her story". "...and I am willing to help her" I try to help whoever is in need. The President asked me to help her. I helped hundreds. Today I'm charged of abetting prostitution. Sometimes you try to be kind, you host people. I guess I am facing an unlucky moment because Everybody and everything is against me. In conclusion, we can't go on like that. But who is Lele Mora? Let's go back in time. Lele Mora was born from farmers in a little town. After the First Communion he entered a seminar But he soon realized it was not what he wanted. He graduated in Hotel and Restaurant management. He worked as cook and barman Till he enters the "Panty Bar". It was a bar located near Montorio Veronese Italian Army barracks. in San Michele Estra. Every evening more than 10,000 soldiers under training Used to go out to have fun. Used to go out to have fun. Many of them used to visit the Panty Bar Many of them used to visit the Panty Bar Because it was talked about. There was a bit of everything: The first drag queens, the first transexuals. The homosexuals used to offer drinks to soldier And flirt with them. Trying to have sex with those young soldier. And I was like a maitresse, the manager of all that. And tell you the truth there were not only soldiers... Also politicians and people from the clerical world. Outside the Panty Bar Mercedes, Rolls Royce... Very Important People. It was just a meeting point. But one evening, at the beginning of September About 60 Carabinieri entered the bar. A perquisition. "This is a brothel!" My flat was above the bar And I was hosting people. They made their perqusition. Switched all the light on, sent the soldiers away. And asked me: "What's upstairs?" I answered: "My wife...if you want to check". "She's just been dismissed from the hospital". "She has just given birth..." "Please feel free to make your perquisition". They told me: "We do not disturb the lady". My wife was indeed upstairs... But there were also friends Who were "relaxing" with their partners. What if they went up? A scandal ! "Are you happy, my son?" Lanie is a young asian girl arrived in Italy five years ago. Like a lot of immigrants She has to support her parents and relatives That in their country are in hardship. I remember a very nice old man. Who used to frequent the "Panty Bar". An 80 y.old man that every monday Used to spend his pension in the bar. We called him "Aunt Angela". He was so excited every monday To meet someone. Before coming to the bar... out of too much excitement To find an handsome young guy to have sex with... He used to masturbate with soap. Lanie helped her sister Lina and her niece Luna To come to Italy. [Lanie] "What time do you go to work tomorow?" [Lina] "I do not have work tomorrow". Now she is not alone in helping her family And in the care of the neonatal Kim. Like many filipina in Italy, Lina is a house helper. But she dreams to become a bartender. [Lanie] "Kim has sticky hands, he touched the malt". Lanie instead has more ambitious projects. It was called "Panty Bar" because before I manged it. The bar was ran by two ladies, a bit whores people used to say. And the two ladies to attract people To have more client They used to wear mini-skirts. And when they had to pick bottles from high shelves They showed their asses, the so called "B" side. And it worked, because "Who shows, sells". Nannini, Patty Pravo, Berte' were singers I loved so much. And thanks to my will to be successfull From just a fan I became their collaborator And eventually their manager. A little nice story about Loredana Berte'. She invited me to spend an evening at her place. She had a table football upstairs where friends used to play. But that evening there were no friends. Just a lady. I thought to myself: "I think I know her". I look at her... Loredana Berte tells me: "She is my friend, a singer". She was in Italy for the first time. She was Tina Turner. I was overwhelmed to meet this music icon While Lorendana was cooking her spaghetti with little tomatoes. She gave me strong vibrations. Because you dream about... These international stars. And you find them in Berte's kitchen, Cooking spaghetti. The friendship with Giannina Facio, which he met in 1982 Paved him the way to international showbiz. She was engaged to Julio Iglesias she was from Costarica. One of the most beautiful women I've ever met in my life. We liked each other at once and we become great friends. As a kid, She used to play with the Kennedys at the White House. Her father was the Costarican Ambassador in Washington. In Montecarlo she got caught in bed with Philippe Junot Ruining the marriage between him and Carolina of Monaco. Sent away from Montecalco, She arrived in Italy and came to live in my house. Giannina introduced me to international stars. Now she is Ridley Scott's wife One of the best director in the world. She opened me the doors of America. In a few years Lele Mora has become The most influencial international showbiz manager. In Italy, in the early eighties His business grows exponentilly And more and more artists want to join his world. I was the one who invented this system To bring TV stars to clubs to drink Champagne. And we earned money without doing anything. From the small provincial "Panty Bar" To the most exclusive clubs Lele Mora found out the way to make a lot of money And to establish himself as the manager of the biggest stars. He was becoming very powerful. I and my artist would go to clubs Stay just one hour, drink And get cash. It seemed like a lot of bees - the artists Would fly on honey - and I was the honey. Beacuse I was able to make them earn money. In fact most of the TV shows of the '80 '90 and '00 Passed through my hands. Until Vallettopoli showgirls scandal. That started destroying my work, my image and credibility. Before that 60% of what Italians used to watch On RAI and Mediaset channels. Was the result of my work, of my creativity Of my way of being an agent. I would like to be famous because I am a vain girl. I like being in the spotlight. I'd like to act to be an actress. This is one of my greatest dreams. To be an artist And to be choosen as an artist is not so easy. I tour a lot of clubs, discos, events. Everyday I receive 400-500 e-mail. E-mails from people who want to enter the showbiz. And out of these 400-500 requests Only one or two persons really have talent. No more than that. Sometimes I find myself very embarassed Because weird people come to me. People willing to do everything. To do everything Just to have a chance. Sometimes very strange people come to me... They propose themselves And expose themselves in an embarassing way. They say: " I can do whatever you want me to do". "You can ask me for sex". "I can go on date with whoever you want". Just a few days ago I've met a really beautiful girl About 21 year old. And I say:" Tell me about your dream". She answers: "Look, I don't want work". "I really don't". "I've read on the newspapers that you..." "deal with female escorts... I want to be an escort! " "People say that at your parties, at your dinners" "There are rich artists and businessmen". She says: "I want to have sex with them, I want their money..." It hurts to get mistaken for a purveyor of escorts And girlfriends. When I do my best to be good agent... But then I roll up my sleeves and say to my self: "Let's make people understand who is Lele Mora!" In America we were guests at the White House. I was amazed to talk face to face With the US President. The lightness of this man, his kindness, his irony... I organized two, three conventions for him. And Italian TV showman Maurizio Costanzo Asked me to bring Clinton to his Costanzo Show To play his sax. I wrote this requests to Clinton assistants. They answered me: "He is a President". "He could never do this in such a TV show". I have to say I met a lot of Head of State. In Spain I met Aznar. I met Arrafat, and his wife. I also worked with Gorbachev. This man had the power either to destroy the world. Or to fix the world. And I organized some conventions for him. Even today I still wonder: How was I able to accomplish such things? Really difiicult works. Despite I don't speak English I know how to get what I want. If somebody would offer me an important role in a movie. A movie I am sure could be succesful. I could... I could say 'Yes' to sex with the producer. Every country... ...has its own whores! Indeed, I did had a relationship that was not appropriate. In fact, it was wrong. A woman that takes her clothes Folds it and freezes it And pulls it out when it is time to verify If there was sexual intercourse It means that she had programed everything To become famous. I am very sorry for what happened. So many women try to do this! Today, does the objectified woman really exist? Isn't quite the man the victime of her sexual traps? Or women are objectified when they become an instrument In the hands of politicians (No to political exchanges on the woman's body) to discredit their opponents? What can push a girl to declare herself a prostitute Before the entire world? Why do they do it? Who paid them so much to do so? I do not think that women are treated as objects... Women are smarter than men. Women are the masters of many games... In the past you couldn't see any woman In power or in command. Nowadays women are more influencial than what we think. And often, men of power have wives That affect their decisions both in politics and in business. Determining their success or failure. Luna do not disturb Kim, ok? Lanie is an apprentice hairdresser. Her dream is to open, one day, her own salon. She would also be happy to find someone Willing to invest on her skills. In life I am a full-time mother. But my dream is to become a famous top-model. And I hope to realize my dream soon. Some known magistrate of Milan prosecutor's office Have made an intolerable intrusion in my private life. Many parties, so many contexts. It's nobody business, but ours. Even Presidents have private lives. Making an unacceptable filing of my guest. In my Arcore's residence. Enjoyment, Italian traditional menu Music, jokes. They discriminated and humiliated people Who were only guilty of being my guests. It is time to stop the pursuit of personal distruction And intrusion into private lives. I met Silvio Berlusconi in 1986. And I must say that the first time I saw him I felt a big thrill. An extraordinary and very kind person. He immediately made me feel at ease. And he asked me: "What shoes are you wearing?" I was wearing a pair of particular Paciotti shoes. And from that day everytime we met He used to ask me about my shoes of the day. That day we had a great meeting and in just one hour time A closed a good contract for my artist. The nice thing is that I understood what kind of person he was. And I fell in love with his way Of dealing with people. I must say that from meeting to meeting We become great friends. And every time I went to Mediaset to propose my artists I had meetings, untill 1994 with President Berlusconi himself. I signed several wonderful contracts bringing big showbiz names From RAI to Mediaset. And everytime I was very excited To meet this name. Because he had this power to transmit enthiusiasm to people. And for almost 10 years I exclusively worked for Mediaset. Later on my artist grew in number and I started working With others television stations such as RAI And Telemontecarlo. In 1992 and 1993 He tells me that he would like to do politics. And asked me: "What do you think about it?" Even though friends we used to call each other by surname. And he is one of the few who calls me by my true name. Because my real name isn't Lele my name is Dario. And every time I meet him he ask me: "How are you Dario?. And I am very pleased about it. There's an aircraft. On board Obama, Berlusconi the Pope and his assistant. The aircraft breaks. And the pilots decide that is better to use the parachutes. Unfortunately, there are only 5 parchutes! The two pilots get their parachutes and tell to the 4 passengers: "There are only 3 left. It is your choice" Obama gets one and says: "I am the most powerful man in the world.." "...this parachute belongs to me". Berlusconi, you know him Gets the second parachute and says: "I am the smarter man in Europe..." "...this parachute belongs to me". The Pope says: "I am the Pope but you are young..." "Please take the last one". But the assistant says: "Your Holyness, there are 2 left". "You know why?" "Because the smarter man in Europe..." "...has jumped with my backpack!" Best wishes and joy! When I was young in my house there was a rule: "No mass on Sunday no food" This was the rule of my family. I used to frequent, let's say The Church in some way. I spent many Christams in the Vatican Where I met a great Pope. The first time I met him I was amazed. I was before a great energy of holyness That this man could transmit. That this man could transmit. And the first time he personally gave me the Eucharist. And the first time he personally gave me the Eucharist. In that very moment I felt A sensation I would never feel again. I also met with other Popes. I met Benedetto XVI. I also met Pope Giovanni XXVIII. But the great energy I felt with Pope Wojtyla I haven't felt with no one else. Totally different but always great energy I felt when I first met Fidel Castro in Cuba. Revolution is the sense of the historical moment. Is to change what has to be changed! Altruism, Solidarity, Heroism. The presence of this Head of State Made you feel a sort of 'terror' something great... He could transmit you deep emotions... True emotions... Never lie. Never violate ethic principles. Mussolini was a great man, a great statesman. A great intelligence, a great socialist. People loved him. Because he created well-being in Italy. I see a man of great culture. History says he did so much for Italy and the Italians. Also my parents taught me that. Then, unfortunately To conquer some countries, he entered into war. Unfurtunately he met Hitler. And he made a mistake to become his ally. Probably he feared him. Reading his diaries together with. Marcello Dell'Utri, a sentece made me think. "How many are these Germans!" How strong and sever are these Germans!" " We Italians, seem good for nothing in comparison to them". He wrote this after his first visit to Germany. I was told a terrible joke about Hitler... I am going to be criticized for that. After some time Hitler's death, his supporters. Come to know he is still alive. They look for him everywhere. And eventually find him in an unknown town in the Andes. Fuhrer you must come back. Democracy has failed. Everybody is waiting for you. And for three days he always refuses. Eventually he accepts and says: "Yes". "I come back only under one condition.." "This time..." "We must be bad!". It was raining. Hitler was giving a speech before two million people. It was raining but everybody was standing still. All these Germans strong, still and attentive. And Mussolini says: "My people with this rain..." "Would have acted like sheeps..." "Everyone would have ran looking for shelter". Mussolini meant to say That Italians sometimes hide and run away. Perhaps this is the reason why he feared Germans so much. When you admit you are a facist or you like Mussolini Everybody criticizes you. But I say History is always History. And we should remember good and bad History. History should be shown in a proper way. In Loreto's Square I would put a huge monument To Benito Mussolini's memory. I was just arrived in Italy. One day at the bus stop A man wanted to talk to me. He told me he wanted to take a picture of me. He wanted me to be a model Because he said I had a nice face. And he could help me to work in the showbiz. I told him that I already have my model book. I guess he just wanted to have sex with me. There are many man Who take advantage of girls who want to work on TV. And pose half-naked for magazines. Piss off! Thanks! Do not move! In my country, in the East To appear is such a way is not as important as it is here. Girls, worship the toilet bowl! It's been said that with the birth of commercial TV President Berlusconi started the commodification of the woman's body. Showing half naked bodies In his TV shows such as DRIVE IN and others. But if we go back in time We find out that half naked pretty girls Have always been a key ingredient For the success of the theatrical variety. Which had great influence on cinema. Films and Theater Shaped the early days of television That was born under the sign of variety. Italians have always seen long legs and big breast on TV. Even before the rise of Silvio Berlusconi's commercial TV And then there is a saying of the wise old man. "Who shows, sells!". At 4 p.m I go to take a look. Which street? Midnight Palace, Business Square. To do this kind of job You should live it to the fullest. Should be the most important thing in your life. More than your private and personal life. Sometimes I also wonder how I could reach... I, a little boy from a little town in Rovigo's province. Got involved in strong, big important mechanisms... I found myself in companion of many politicians. Bettino Craxi, De Michelis. And other politicians of the so called "First Repulic". Politics and Showbiz. Attract each other, because in the middle There's always a woman. Marilyn and Kennedy. Carla Bruni and Sarkozy. Naomi Campbell and Hugo Chavez. From right to left wing There's a fatal attraction between top politicians and showgirls. And in Italy Silvio Berluconi is the point of contact Between politics and entertaiment. And thanks to him places of power Are now filled with showgirls. I raised a woman like Mara Carfagna. A showgirl from Miss Italia. A woman of great culture and great intelligence. I never thought she would become a minister. I told her that for me she is and she will remain The Mara Carfagna I used to know. That used to come to my house, like a daughter. I believe having women in politics is a good thing. "In my party you can freely express yourself". "I love you" The leftists said that since Minister Carfagna posed naked She was unfit to be a minister In Berlusconi's goverment. "Sure! And I would like to say hello to "Cicciolino Mitterand". But if these are the parameters for evaluation Right or left wing are just the same! Vladimir Luxuria. The first transexual deputee with a past as a prostitute. "That bad period of my life belongs to the past". "Luckily, I did it for a short period of time". "After all we also learn from our mistakes". When gays will be the 51% of population You'll be the abnormal ones. Sexuality is in your head. It is comanded by your brain. Nowadays I guess 51% of adults are homosexuals. I also believe That is better to put the limit of 60 year of age to politicians. We should give space to the youth. And I say this even though I would like to become a senator. If we take a close look to the left wing We wonder why a young brilliant And politically well prepared like Debora Serrachiani Rising star of the Democrats A woman that in the 2009 European Polls defeated Berlusconi Has not been candidated as secretary of the Democratic Party As the base of her party would have wanted. Democrats Secretary Bersani told I made a mistake to meet Berlusconi In his private house. I believe that the secretay of my party I am so proud to belong to Should tell people what ideas we have for the future. And not making gossip on Berlusconi. Look, if Berluconi rules it's our fault! Beacues in 2006 we won the elections. But then we started quarrelling. And after only two years we sent him back to power. Now, they should not teach us the moral on ideological issues. telling me: "You could have met him in Rome..." "...but not at his Arcore's residence". And why is that? Are they afraid I would enjoy Bunga Bunga with Berlusconi? There are many things that directors of newspapers do not publish. But take home and put safe in their drawers... Some prestigeous director linked to masonry There are still many of them which direct newspapers. They mostly hide hot political issues. Or some material good for exchange. Some directors instead of publishing them. Put in the drawer and pull them out at the right moment. (Photo of blackmail politicians) (Hunting for Corona's secret archives) But the most prepared in this matter. Is Corona, he has got interesting photos.. "Who is he?". "I cannot tell you by phone". "Would you imagine! A very important politician..." "...with transexuals! I tell you only this!". Fabrizio Corona on the phone with one of his paparazzi. In his net of blackmail photos a politician had fallen. Corona went too far beyond on certain things... They wanted to blackmail Silvio Sircana President Prodi's spokesman. There was the Prime Minister's trusted man in Corona's viewfinder. "Let me see the photos first". "This is my job". "I will bring you his photos". "Because if you do it once, you always do it". "Every transexual, he would stop and look". "If he did not like one, he moved forward". "But then I really liked one of them". "Was he escorted?". "No, he was alone". (Romano Prodi, former Prime Minister) "I know nothing about this". "I do not understand, it makes no sense to me". Sircana tells to the journalists. "They just want to ruin me..." "I am a good man". "Somebody has just found a way to destroy me". I am bisexual. I've got no problems to admit it. I prefer to live my life freely Without hinding anything Because I believe you can live a better life. Man or a woman nothing really matters. What's important is the feeling That you have for a person. And feelings are sacred and should be respected. And what you do in your bed, with a man or a woman Doesn't matter as long as you do it in your house. I guess Corona identified himself with this character He created beacuse he is not like that. I believe he is sweet, kind, sensitive person. But he wanted to demonstrate the opposite. His dream was Joe Gambino in America. He sees himself in mafia characters. But I think he's rather a fake mafioso. Underneath he's got a tender heart. With Fabrizio Corona I spent 12 years of hate and love. I really spoiled him. He wanted a Bentley ,and I bought it. I bought him expensive motorbikes. I am not a man addicted to sex. I am really not. I'm a simple man. I am already satisfied With the orgasm from my job. I have not had other loves. I believe you can only have one big true love in your life. And I had my wife on one side And Fabrizio Corona on the other side. I am afraid to be left alone. I always feel in need of companion, friendship. Even if true friends are rare all the others use you. When you do not have anything to give them anymore. They treat you as an old shoe And throw you to the garbage. I am not an hypocritical girl, so I say that if a producer Or another person linked to showbiz Would approach me and propose me A sexual compromise to sing at Sanremo's festival. Since it is my dream to be famous as a singer. I'd probably sell my body. The saying that to enter showbiz you must sell your body. It's simply not true. Once you give it away it becomes tastless. The less you give your sex the more you get. Some people think they are stars Just because they have got 2 minutes of popularity. "This is my best friend". Art is the top, art is to study to prepare oneself. "I see everything beautiful in the showbiz". "...all those beautiful and famous showgirls" "...and I'd like to enter this beautiful world". My idea is to give jobs to people who know how to work. I would like to be an actress, I would love it but... Do you think you have the qualities to become famous? Yes, I do...even if I am not tall. By the way: also Kate Moss is small, so... I would like to be famous because I am a dynamic person. And I guess I have 70% of the qualities required To enter the world of fashion anf the showbiz. I want to enter into showbiz Because I feel it is a world taylored for me. It runs in my blood. Nowadays all Italians want to do television. Want to sing. Everyone is a singer. "I will have..." "...to change..." In 2010 for the TV show X-Factor. 300,000 auditions have taken place. And for the 'Big Brother' more thatn 400,000. From what you wrote I know That you have already participated In the "Men and Women' TV show. So I guess You want to be a 'courted man', now if I am not wrong In the beginning everyone wants to be a "courted man". But two years ago I was afraid to be "The Courted man". Because you must be intelligent for that role. Back then I was 22-23 year old and I wasn't ready. Very well, thanks. It is enough for me. You may go now, thanks. My name is Andrea Scifo, I am 30 from Sicily. My name is Gianpaolo Sgattoni. I was born in 1987 in San Bendetto del Tronto. My Zodiac sign is Pisces. I'd like to star in 'Men and Women'. Ok, Thanks. Thanks to you... Well, I saw many of them. You take care of the others... Then we'll evaluate together all the candidates. If you have the skills, if you are gifted You do not need neither to pay Nor to sell your body. It is enough to be yourself. Believe in what you do and do your best. Beware of those people who promise you Things they can't give you. For a while, I switch off the gas. Also Lanie in her country was briefly part of showbiz. And also in Italy she had her chance to work in this field. But she chose a different profession. I was choosen for some works as photomodel. But eventually I did not accept. Because I decide to be an hairdresser. It is not true, I've never worked as hairdresser. Pasquale was the hairdresser. I invested on his skills. All the people I used to frequent Became clients of my salons. And in Verona I was able to run 6 salons. Where Pasquale used to cut hair. VIP's cocaine, Verona trembles. Shampoo and cocaine for VIP. I was investigated about VIP's cocaine case. Many people were involved in that case But I was the only one who paid and suffered. Maradona and Caniggia were involved. And also Bijon Borg and Berte Not to mention all the others. Conviction can be a great experience. And for me it was. In jail I was telling: "I am not guilty". "I do not know why I am here". "They'll let me out soon". I was right. But what hurted me at a human level Was the feelings of my parents Honest and simple persons from the countryside. My father, when he visited me in jail He fainted, he could not stand the sorrow. They had to take him out. He felt so ashamed That he stayed home till the case ended. At 6 a.m, I usually sleep. I do not go clubbing at night as you do. I am in my car going to Mediaset for a meeting. What about you? Eh, you are not asking me for a simple favour... Yeah, I get your point, but let me figure it out... I'll do whatever is in my power...and you know it. You work for years. You build up things, create. And then out of the blue you find yourself caught In the middle of an earthquake Which destroys everthing you did in a lifetime. Accusations of conspiracy and extortion. The public prosecutor Woodcock was basing his accusations On dozen of wiretaps. Proves of blackmails aginst showbiz VIP. It is wierd, there are judges who dare to accuse me With no evidences. Only after listening to half words of those wiretaps. According to the prosecutor the mechanism was simple. Lele Mora knew about all the movements of his VIP artists And he allegedly passed all the information on to Corona. Paparazzo and former husband of the showgirl Nina Moric. Corona was reposible of shooting embarrassing pictures Which would be used to blackmail the stars. Stars and character like Simona Ventura. She was the first one to suspect that some scoops About her private life were driven by her own manager. I could never betray artists I work for. My job is to protect them. She eventually realize that I didn't do her no harm. Some victims allegedly paid up to 50-60 thousand euro To avoid their pictures to be published on gossip magazines. I had indeed withdrawn many times, at my expenses Compromising pictures about her that had not to be published. This investigation was born as an offshoot of the one Which led to the arrest of Prince Vittorio Emanuele of Savoia Whos spoke about Mora and his role as purveyor of customers To Campione's Casino. Some people belonging to the world of Justice. Prosecutors, Judges. They like to be shown on TV. Maybe all this was inaugurated by Congressman Di Pietro. Tangentopoli (Bribes and Politics). Magistrates become Showmen. TV shows such as "One day in Disctric Court". The cases of the day Forum... They are proud to be shown on TV. Whereas some other magistrate You are informed about cases you are involved in First by TV news and later by them. Prosecutors and Magistrates Care so much about their P.R. And they know how to sell their news. Unfortunately, I have had experience of this. When there was much to eat, drink and enjoy. I was number 1, like a God. Everybody adored me. Wanted to work with me. People falling in line even at night. Outside the gate of my villas in Sardinia. Everybody acclaiming me only because I could make them famous. I could make them rich. But then the sad moment of my life arrived. My artists went away, abandoned me, hid away. Neither a word of encouragement, nor moral support. I remember some artists wanted to marry me. Have children with me. Because I could be their God, you know... Only because I made them earn a lot of money. Those days were very sad, very difficult. Because my office was not receiving any call at all. And then an Internal Revenue perquisition occured. And then confiscation. "DEBT COLLECTION" They even confiscated the bulbs of my lamps! From a well-being and luxury life I found myself With not even money to buy myself a sandwich. I was used to give parties, to have many guests. And I find myself in a very difficult situation. I could not really see an end to all this. My mind could not keep up. I fell into depression. I could not get out of bed. My cellphone is my life partner it's always with me. I keep it on even at night. I answer to anybody calling me and I even talk about silly things. But during those days I was not minding my cellphone. Did not want to wash to shave. During those days a few persons remained close to me. Sabrina Ferilli visited me 'cause she was worried. Depression can't be cured in one day. I was telling myself: "Why should I go through all this for things I did not do?". "Why should I still live in this world?". Thanks to the true love of my daughter, of some female friends. I said: "Today is the turning point'. "Either I jump and die or I start living again". I decided to get up I shaved and started living again. Even though with all my daily pills. To carry on. And finally I received good news... Lele Mora gets cleared of the last accusation Of conspiracy and exploitation of prostitution. Thus Lele Mora is acquitted. In the last months Also the other accusations were dropped. The accusation of blackmailing soccer players Adriano e Coco And extortion against Francesco Totti. One hour later I received a call. It was a great joy for me. The Prime Minister Berlusconi called me and told me: "Congratulations Lele". It was the first time for him to call me Lele. Because he always calls me 'Dario". "We made it. They eventually recognized the good person you are". Pregnancy is a delicate event for a woman. If you do not have the right conditions It can turn into a nightmare. Well, my mother never worried about it. In the past it was different. In the past? My mother is 33 years old. And 7 sons and daughters... In the past men used women just for breeding. For the procreation. To prepare food. I am not saying treated as objects 'cause I do not belong to that way of thingking. But women always sacrificed themselves. Then feminism came. Women demanding for their share of power. I believe women decide for themselves what they want to do And what they want to achieve. The woman is the engine of life. Without women we would not be here. In my country is just like that. It is better to have a child while you are still young Than when you are much older. 'cause then you get tired more easily. And I am happy for my choice. I was 25 when I got pregnant. I believe at 25 you are not so young to have a child. I would have wanted to remain pregnant at 20. It is really hard but I am happy. I am happy to have him. Although he is very naughty. I am so happy to have him. What to say about Ruby... A girl in need of money and love... I pitied her and I even tried to adopt her As I found out that she had a lot of problems. Then I quarell with my son and my daughter When I told them my decision To adopt her. Not really adopt her but rather support her. She told me about some problems she was facing with her family With her father. Her life problems. And I got very touched by that. I talked to the social assistance about this situation But my request to foster care was denied. In the meanwhile she was assigned to a group home in Genova. But she ran away also from that place. Like from all the other group homes she was assigned to. Then she met a young man who gave her hospitality And fell for her. Then Ruby's case blew up! And everyday we are on all newspapers. Ruby told that the President Has been more than generous with her. I helped her as much as I could. I am happy that Ruby can now have her own family. I know for sure that she is getting married. I'll be witness to her marriage. She asked me for it and I'll do it with great pleasure. But still before that. Bunga Bunga one more time! (Berlusconi) You are all invited to Bunga Bunga! Bunga Bunga party! Tell me more Pedro. Get to the bottom of that one. Do you know what is it, Carlo? So, talk to me bro. Well, there's a few meanings. One is that there is a....naked party Involving a lot of activity. All around the world people talk about Bung Bunga. Bunga Bunga is a battle cry of the President. Everytime he tells this joke. Geddaffi invites him to Libia. He takes along with him Honorable Cicchito and Hon. Bondi. The two tour all Libia around. And get abducted by the only not civilized tribe left. Afterwords they get tied up to a pole For a rite. The people of the tribe ask them. "Do you want to die or do you want Bunga Bunga?". Honorable Bondi answers first. "I want Bunga Bunga". But Bunga Bunga means to be sodomized. Cicchitto sees poor Bondi And now it's his turn. "Do you want to die or do you want Bunga Bunga?". He answers: "I would rather die". "But first", the head of the tribe tells him "A bit of Bunga Bunga". The second is a Geddaffi term as well, maybe. Get yourself to the Vatican. It's just near here actually. Yeah I know. - Not too far away. That's why I gotta be careful with what I am saying. I dont' want to get struck by lightning. Bunga Bunga party, Alleluja. I do not know what's true about Bunga Bunga... What I can say is that beatiful women Can use their body to make a lot of money. And nobody forces them to do so. I believe their are not victims. Here we are again! Listen, Bunga Bunga is only a joke! I do not remember this joke well, but it's a joke. A joke about two tribes, right? Chosing between diying and Bunga Bunga...I do not know. I do not remember but it's a joke. Is Flo Marincea who is talking. She is a showgirl managed by Lele Mora. Whos was a guest in many parties. At the President's residence. Along with her Francesca Capriani was also present. Former "Big Brother' contestant And TV show "La Pupa e il Secchione" winner. She also, managed by Lele Mora. (Lele Mora enters Silvio Berlusconi's residence in Ancore) My parents my brothers and sisters Live in a savage and isolated place of the Philippines. Where people work 'with' the earth. Still using cows and old machines. This one, Lady. It's delicious cooked adobo stile. Even in that far away area The news about Ruby-Berlusconi scandal has been spreading. And people have also heard about Lele Mora. It's strange to me that a man like Lele Mora Who worked with international stars Would need to take girls escort around. Munich (Germany) Yes, I know what Bunga Bunga means. The sex parties of the Italian President. Very exciting parties involving perhaps Very young girls and perhaps older men Having extemely good time. This is the private life of the President And he can do whatever he wants. It's just my opinion. I think everybody tries to have some form of Bunga Bunga parties. It's about trying to do what you can do To explore your own needs and feelings. I think Bunga Bunga....it's ok! Bunga Bunga! In Italy, cast the first stone who is not a sinner. All men like to enjoy parties full of beatiful women. But some men can afford them And others just can't. The one who can't envy the one who can And then condemn them and criticize them. Rinaldo Talamonti is Germany's most famous italian immigrant. He is the owner and the chef of a well known restaurant Located at the center of Munich. He is mostly famous as actor and showman Since he acted in 142 film. I've been living in Germany for 44 years. And I am proud to be Italian. I started acting in 1970 as the 'Little Italian'. I am Bavaria's 'Little Italian'. I worked with so many women. The Motto of us Italians immigrants in Germany was: "We work and struggle". "For the bread and for the pussy..." You got it! I believe that. It's normal to go with women if you like women. These women want to do it. They are not forced to do anything. And he doesn't put pressure on them. It's impossible. Thus, even if you go with more than one woman... Everyone has his own vices and virtues. Breast are the first thing we put in our mouth when we are born. In addition, we are human beings, we like to sin. Also Adam sinned with a woman. But it is not right to destroy a person Or bring down a government. Just because he had girlfriends lovers or whatsoever. Even Presidents have private lives. Our country has been distracted by this matter for too long. Often, in the evening, he calls me saying: "I am home, what do you do?" I am having a party with friends. Berlusconi: "Come to my place to talk and drink something". Lele introduced me to the President. But I cannot abandon all my friends... Berlusconi: "Then take everybody with you". I wanted to meet him. He is so nice. So I take 2, 3, 4, cars call his escort to give all the names... And we go to visit him, to drink, to listen to music. Arcore's parties are like Lele's parties Nothing really changes. Like Silvio Berlusconi also Lele Mora loves to give parties. And good food is an essential ingredient of those parties. Girls, would you like any meat? Yes, I would, thanks... Give me your plate, honey, come on... One or Two?. What about you?. Is histrionic! Eat now! We've been to dinner the President use to tell his jokes. Just ordinary things. I do not believe, I don't believe about Ruby. I belive it's all bullshit. All this scandal seems to me an exaggeration. These leftist. I can't talk...these other parties. I do not know, I do not care about it. From a little something like that. They created a huge case. The only thing they say is: "He must resign, he must resign!" Once again, justice has been bent to political purposes. The opposition is trying to take him down. It's not a free nation a nation in wich magistrates Carry on political battles Unlawfully using their power. They are always trying to destroy him. But he takes it hard and goes on. With perfect timing They have made public their investigations. You first come to know such news from TV newspapers. And eventully from them... They claim to have enough evidences... But it's not like that. I'm a welcomed guest. To ask for immediate judgement. Everyone believes I am A collector of perverse females to take to Arcore. Their accusations against me Are completely groundless. She told she was 24 years old. And I've believed her. And the minor denies she has ever had sex with me. She states that she introduced herself as a 24 y. old girl. As witnessed by several people. If I was asked to work in the Italian TV I would refuse. They show naked girls Yes, I go to the beach wearing a skirt. People look at me in a strange way. I am filipina that's why. My son, what do you want to do, my son? Gossip makes the news In television. If you talk about interesting things Nobody cares. Nowadays people want just to watch through the peephole What happens beyond their doors. In somebody else's house. Gossip creates monster, and we see it. Ruby is now in great demand for advertising campaigns. For events. Italy is now like that. But not only Italy, also many other countries. Abroad, they make fun of Italy over the Ruby-Berlusconi scandal. But then they pay Ruby well to have her At their exclusive parties. As it has happend to the Vienna debutantes' ball. Where Austrians have fallen in line for her autograph. Like she was a true diva. Either you like them or not. Condemnable or not. Lele Mora e Silvio Berlusconi Are two men out of the ordinary Who started from scratch and built with skills and cunning An empire. They live according to their own thruth. Loved, hated, investigated. If you know how to make a good cocktail Made with beautiful women and men. Politicians. Good food. Life to the fullest. Honesty. And keeping your word. All these ingredients make an explosive cocktail. And you will succeed for sure. There's a half-truth behind every issue. There's always something true behind every news. And everything depends upon your point of view. Like the statue of Neptune in Bologna. From a certain perspective we see the left thumb. But as we change perspective The thumb seems a totally different thing. Truth is just like that. It's partly true and partly untrue. Sing for us, Silvio! Allright, you've called for it! Go... With this song I've paid my studies at the Sorbona University. Because I used to study at day and sing at night in Paris. Faces can be seen With sensational necks. Many languages are spoken. Just like a Babel Tower. And when the dawn comes There comes the great market of love. It's the place where to walk For those who like to live at night. A small water spill and a metro station. Full of bistrot, Pigalle. Homeless, camelot, owners of bistrot. Coco traffickers, Pigalle. Young women that smile at you and tell you: "Come here, darling". And prosper those who in a corner with discretion Earn their daily bread. Well furnished and well informed hotels. It is a come and go, Pigalle. And at midnight can be heard a refrain Coming from a night club... Sing for us Silvio, sing for us.
