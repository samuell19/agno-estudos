What is this? There is no signature of the Pakistan Consulate on the child's visa. Oh no! Sir forgot to sign here. That's alright, but legally, I cannot permit the kid to board the flight without proper signature. What are you talking officer? How can we go without him? Please officer, try to understand Sakeena is the daughter of the Mayor of Lahore She is going home to celebrate Id there after many years. If she does not reach in time, everyone will be disappointed. Is it possible to get the signatures now? That is possible only after three days now. The officer in charge has gone to celebrate Id with his relatives. We were so happy that we will all go there together, but now Sakeena, you carry on, we will follow after two days. He is right. I will get the kid's visa and send them later. Give me your papers, I will get your boarding cleared. It is only a matter of two days. Do, I want to go. Even I will go! We will go after two days. Come, I will show you the airplane. Father, you? If we had not had a visa problem, even Jeetu and my husband would have come along with me. Look there. Father, you came here and did not even meet my husband? If I had stepped on the soil of India, it would have reopened a thousand wounds. This land has even snatched my son Aslam from me. And anyway, neither this land, nor the country and neither its people are ours Our motherland, our people, our country, is Pakistan. It is good to see the daughter of the Mayor get such a warm welcome, or the whole city would crowd here. Yes, why not? Sakeena deserves such a welcome. Is Dehru coming? Dehru? What nonsense are you talking? I asked, is Dehru coming? Is there going to be a public meeting? What nonsense are you talking? Are you mad? You Britisher... Britishers, go back! Hail India! Brother, please don't mind. He was hit on the head during freedom struggle, that is why he sometimes go back to the time of 1946 when the country had not been partitioned. Partition? There is no partition. Sakeena is coming back. Sarfaraj, with Sakeena's return, my life has become meaningful. I understand your feelings. My only worry is that Sakeena's past should not come in the way of our future. Sakeena is my daughter, she will not disobey me. You are saying this even after knowing everything? This is not the truth, it's our helplessness. Our community lost so much in those riots. I still cannot forget the dastardly killing of Aslam. Right before my eyes, he was... Mother, please! Everyone suffered during those riots. But why were we made scapegoats For God's sake mother, Keep quiet, Sakeena! You are only worried about yourself, not our honor. Do you know what people were saying when your father came to receive you That you are a disgrace, that you lived with an Indian. We had to speak so many lies to save face. Forget Tara Singh. What are you saying, mother! We are married, we even have a son. I cannot live without him and my son. Aren't we living after having lost our son? The boundary separating India and Pakistan has created a distance that can never be shortened. I have seen everyone. Dow I have to leave After pushing your father in the darkness of sorrows... Don't say that, father. It is regretful that despite being educated, you don't understand my point. When one is out and it begins to rain, one is forced to take shelter against a wall. Even you did just that. Do father, he did not pressurize me in any way. He was ready to risk his life and bring me to Lahore. It is impossible to find a man like him anywhere in the world And also impossible to find a more helpless father than me. I understand that it will take you some time to forget your past. That will never happen. Father send me back to my husbavd Shaku, my every step takes me ahead. You have a bright political future ahead of you. I want to see you as a Celebrity of Pakistan How do I make you understand? Everything for me now is my family, my home. Sister, please don't go. If you do family honor will be disgraced. One must never lose hope. If you keep father happy, even he will keep you happy. Had this poem being in Urdu, it would have been fabulous. Urdu is such a descriptive language, unlike Hindi. Do you mean to say that even music should have been partitioned along with the country? You should have atleast adorned her forehead. Take this, child. Here comes my daughter! Meet my friend, Lal Bakshi Shah. He's a MP. Bless you. May you live long. And he is Haider Ali, the editor of the renowned Akhbaar Jung' Hello. I will publish the incident that happened with you in India on the first page. May God punish that foreigner who... I am desperately waiting for that day when Sakeena will hold the reins of political power Yes Sarfaraj, sympathy does help a lot in politics. You are an ace at the game of politics. You turned the tables by not clearing the visa of the child. Yes, I didn't allowed to clear the visa. I don't want to see you with that Jat. I made a grave mistake in coming here out of love for you. If I had known that you will punish my family like this, I would never come This high status, this luxury, this position, is this all a punishment? My business, my political future, lies in this country. Whether you cry or scream, you will have to live in Pakistan If that you what you want, I will not go to India. I will neither phone, nor write a letter to them. I will wait, because I know that one day, he will surely come to take me back. He will come here from India? That Jat, that enemy of ours, who shed the blood of our community, will come to our land? I promise you, even the news of his death will not reach India. I will kill him so brutally that it will be difficult to recognize him. Please give me the visa. I have even brought my marriage certificate from the Gurudwara now. That will not help, Tara Singh. I have told you several times before that the marriage that took place during riots are not recognized by both the countries. They are considered illegal. If my marriage to Sakeena is illegal, then is this child also illegal? Please don't harass us, sir. All my money is over coming so many times to Delhi. I have been ruined. You have come again to bore me! How foolish! It is me who has been fooled Mr. Lqbal. You had said that you will give my child's visa in three days, and then, even my visa... Stop your nonsense! I will bring an end to this once and for all. Listen to this carefully. I have received orders from my seniors that you should not be allowed to go to Pakistan. You will not get a visa Mr. Ismail, do you think Tara will not go to Pakistan just because a piece of paper is not stamped? Do power, no boundary can stop me from taking my son to his mother. I will go, I will definitely go. You will go to Pakistan? Have you gone mad? That too, for a woman who turned her back on you? Who never even bothered to write you a letter? I never trusted that community. I gave in only because you were adamant. What has gone never returns. Forget about her. What are you saying! That I forget her? She is my wife, the mother of my son. He is right. How can he forget just like that? He is right. The poor child, what can he do? What you have left, you will lose that if you go to Pakistan. You are a handsome young man. I will find you a nice girl and get you married again. Forget that unfaithful woman. She is not unfaithful, uncle. I am sure she has some problem Get that letter! You have gone crazy. Even after making so many rounds, after being humiliated, you haven't learnt your lesson. Take this letter, read The daughter of the Mayor in a Jat's custody. She was tortured. She even had to bear children.' Dow atleast do you believe that she is unfaithful? These are all lies. I will surely go to Pakistan and bring her here. Papa, even I will come along. Do son, you will stay here. Do papa, even I will come along. You will stay here! How are you? Is everything alright Life goes on. I miss you all very much. The name of the country has changed, territories have changed, but the love of two friends for each other cannot change. You always leave me behind. Can't you walk along with me sometimes? Hear that, Tara Singh! If I would leave you behind, would I have such a large family You don't understand? All these children are mine. You connected so many compartments with one engine? Engine! What is it? Come here. Go and prepare some food. She is my big problem. Mushtak, Rashid, Ahmed, all of you come here. Tell me, isn't he the same Tara Singh who is sitting outside with your father? Isn't he, Munna? What rubbish are you talking mother. This one has a beard, and he is clean shaven. Don't worry Kake I am here He is Tara Singh, not Tara Khan. Excuse me, brother. You have been asking me since long about who he is and where he has come from. Even he is a creation of God. Then whether he is Singh or Khan, Isn't it right? - You shutup Speak softly. Why do you have to talk like that? Make some buttermilk. Marrying you has ruined me. Foolish woman! Come on you good for nothing kids of a foolish woman. Kake, where did he go? Have the words of this foolish woman hurt you? Have you forgotten what mother used to say? She used to say that she has two sons, Kaka and Gullu I know. I don't want to become a problem. To whom are you saying this? A friend brings happiness and peace for his friend. If I could, I would take all your troubles on myself. But who can fight what God has destined for us? Look, Sakeena is marrying Salim, the son of Sarfaraj of Ismailpur. We are free now, India got freedom Stop! What music are playing? After independence, if you have to play anything, play this... India is the best! What is this you are saying, Gaffar! Move back, move back, O people of the world, India is ours! Shut-up, you fool! Why should I shut up? I am a true Indian. Karim, how many times have I told you to leave him home? Sir, it would not be right to lock him in the house on the occasion of a wedding. Take him away! Lock up this mad man! Mad? Who is mad? I am not mad, you all are mad. You all are mad. I am somebody's... Shameless! Keep quite! Sakku, woman has to go with the situation. Do as your parents say. The wedding procession is waiting out side Why are you forcing? You are a priest You should be concerned with a yes or no. Don't forget that to stop a crime is also the duty of a priest It is a crime to solemnize the marriage of a woman whose first husband is still alive. This is not a crime. What you have done is a crime. In our religion, if both man and woman are not muslim, their marriage is considered a sin Forget about him. One may forget to breathe, Sun may forget to rise, You may forget your God but I will never ever forget him. Fear God. God does not listen only to you priest You bad mouthed woman! Shameless! She will not agree so easily. She will feel satisfied only after her adamancy kills someone in the family dies. You have gone mad! If you have to take poison, give it to this arrogant girl. Have it and die! We will assume you never returned. Aunt, I am helpless, I cannot even die. I know that he will suffer immense hardship but will surely come here. He will call out to me. He will look for these eyes If he doesn't find me, I cannot be unfaithful to him. Do, I can't That Indian will come? He is a Romeo, a true lover. But I will beat him so much that he will forget all about love Leave Sakeena! I had left her once. I thought that she will be pleased to meet her father But you have hurt her so much Stop your nonsense! How dare you step onto our soil! I will kill you so brutally that it will be hard to recognize you. You'll had shed a lot of blood of our community. Didn't you'll also shed the blood of our community? You'll killed my parents, my siblings, everybody! But that is all over now. Today, I have come to take my wife the mother of my son. I have forgotten my hatred, you also do the same. Forget my hatred for you Indians If I could, I would shoot each and every Indian dead. How can you kill us Indians? You survived because of us Indians. The whole world knows that we gave you 65 crore rupees at the time of partition. And you talk of killing us? You are challenging the Pakistan army? We have taken over half of Kashmir. One day, we will take over the whole of India Send off your daughter with me as a good father, that is in your interest. Or if I get angry today, I will kill every one I will kill you... Stop! Stop! Please stop, for God's sake! Mr. Ashraf, you are behaving like a devil You'll are politicians, not butchers. The problem can be solved through discurssion dialogue. Karim, take him to the guest room. Ashraf come with me. Sarfaraz, you also come. Come on. Kazisaab, If you had not stopped me, I would have beheaded that idiot! Mr. Ashraf, temper does not let one think straight. You are a politician, anything you do makes headlines. Just think, if that Jat had lost his life at your door step You are right. If we can get thinks done legally, why adopt evil means. You have entered Pakistan without a visa. If we want, we can make you rot in jail on charges of spying. But I will not do that because my daughter is my weakness I am not such a cruel father that I will not bow before my daughter's wishes. But fot that you will have to accept two conditions. One, you will have to eccept Islam relegion. And two you will live here in Pakistan What are you saying! Why, do we have to make all the sacrifices for your happiness? If I can bow before him if I can forget my hatred and embrace an Indian, can't he do even this much for you? If you can become a Hindu for him, can't he become a Muslim for you? I know such decisions cannot be taken so easily, so I give you a day's time. Think about it. You are fortunate Tara Singh, that Allah has invited you into his fold, has given you an opportunity to become a Muslim. What are you thinking? Do you accept Islam? A man's greatest religion is to protect his wife and children Do you accept Islam? Kaashi and Kaba are one, Ram and Rahim is one! Do you accept Islam or not? I do. Wonderful! Come to the mosque, with all the grace and dignity, Wait a minute, priest! Before he steps into our scared mosque, let us confirm whether he is worthy of becoming a muslim or not. If you accept Islam, say, 'Hail Islam.' Say, hail Islam! Hail Islam! Say 'Hail Pakistan! ' Hail Pakistan! Dow say, 'India be damned'. Mr. Ashraf, why are you playing this political game? I don't have any objection to praising Pakistan, but my India was worthy of praise, is worthy of praise, and will always be worthy of praise. Hail India! Hail India! Stop your nonsense! Until you don't damn India, how will our people believe that you are a true muslim? Most of the muslims in this country belong to India. Their heart beats for India. Does that mean they are not true muslims? Stop arguing! If you don't say 'Damn India', you will not get Sakeena. I've had enough! If I can bow my head before you for the sake of my wife and kid, I can also behead you. Why have you all gone numb? Catch that Idiot! Hail India! Stop, sir! Brother, stop! India has become independent. When the country has become free why don't you let me unfurl the flag Hail India! This is not India, it is Pakistan. This is Pakistan. Brother! Brother! What nonsense are you talking? This country is not some field that you can divide it anytimw The leaders of our country are not so mad. Hail India! We thought that in the process of making him accept Islam, we will enrage him so much that our people amidst the crowd would kill him. But how was I to know that your two hundred heroes would become eunuchs when confronted with that Jat. At times, even a coward turns brave. Sir look, these people don't let me fly the tricolor. These people are saying this is Pakistan. Is that possible? Karim, take him away. I am in the midst of an important discussion Mr. Ashraf, the bus in which Tara Singh had escaped was found fallen in a ditch near Mirpur. Brother, don't worry. The Indian boundary is 400 miles away from Mirpur. Sir, his photograph has been published in every newspapers. Police is standing on vigil everywhere. He will not escape from inspector Suleman now I don't know anything, my daughter should not be hurt. I want my daughter back. Here, have this hot tea. How is your son? You also have tea Thank you very much. If you had not given us shelter, our son's condition would have worsened. I will forever be grateful to you for this favour. What favour? My husband recognised you when you came here at night My husband use to water Mr. Sarfaraz's Garden. You use to come there right? Oh, your ear rings are so pretty If I risk my life and save you, even I should benefit out of it. I will take a piece of jewelry everyday You can stay here without any fear. I'm coming. Don't worry, no one will come here now That woman has her eye on your ornaments. You are my ornament. Shall I tell you something, Tara? Even if I die today, I will have no regrets. What nonsense are you talking? We will all return to. India. I will take you there. You take care of Jeetu, I will make arrangements and come Sir, we are old friends God promise, I will drop you Hattari. Here keep some money. Return them after you reach to India. You don't understand. You have your family with you and it's good to have some money. Dow tell me from where we have to pick your wife up? - From maliwada Let me go and bring my car. Good Job, That idiot shouldn't escape And also I know where he has kept Mayer's daughter. But my reward is... Friend? You have showen your color... Diyazuddin has gon up. And don't follow us otherwise we will kill you too. What do you mean? I mean Father is Father and Son is Son What you didn't understand? Son comes from Farhet, in the same way your Pakistan came from India. I don't understand, when he was ready to eccept Islam why you had to ask him to say silly things You keep quiet. Do you think that he will leave Pakistan with Sakina? I should have trusted you. I lost the happiness I had found with great difficulty. One day is over. Do one thing, hand over those earrings to me. Your earrings are lovely. Give them to me. Have some fear of God. She is the daughter of the Mayor. If he comes to know, you'll be beheaded. Doesn't matter. I don't mind dying after wearing those ornaments. What have you ever done for me? We could only afford rice and pulses. Opportunity has knocked on my door. I will not let it pass by. Dobody will come here. Dow the truck union leader will take me to the border. Let go off my neck, we are old acquaintances. Son, let go off my neck. I know they are playing politics with you, but everyone is not the same. Let me explain. Every man in Pakistan will sympathize with you. Rehman Bahai is absolutely right. Gullu, you? Since I read about you in the newspapers, I have been looking for you. I was sure you would visit Rehman Bhai. God is with us. I am sure we will find a way to get you out of Pakistan. Come, come with me. You don'r worry. I am here to protect you. Give me those bangles. Mammy, what harm have we done to Pakistan that they are us? It's true that the country has been partitioned but the business between them is still goes on India imports sugar from Pakistan and Pakistan imports their betel leaves. But both spew hatred both for each other Anyway, it is true that every Friday, mail trains carry sugar and cotton to India via Rajasthan. Drugs are sent concealed in sugar and cotton. Drugs? What are you saying! Sit down, sir. If drugs can be sent, then by your grace, even men can be sent across. What are you talking? Since the weight has increased, You don't get up. Dothing is greater than money Your work will be done. Assume your people have reached India. Brother, this is the number of the coach of the mail train. Be there by 2 PM. The train leaves at sharp 2:20 PM Gullu, this favour you have done... What are you saying, and to whom We shared a relationship. You reach there, I will follow you. Dow go. Wanted dead or alive. It's shocking! Pakistan has been disgraced! An ordinary Indian abducted the daughter of the Mayor. I have heard that he has married Sakeena. He even has a son. If that is true the poor man was harassed. What are you talking? Can you make an Hindu your son-in-law? Give me your wedding necklace. This is a sacred token of marriage I cannot part with it. I had told you the first day itself that I will take a jewellery piece from you everyday. If you cannot give me, go away from here. I will not go without him. You will not part with it so easily. Give it to me! Leave my mother. Ah! Tell me, was my daughter staying here or not? Yes, she had. She stayed here for three nights. My daughter had to live in this dirty, filthy place. Sir, I found these ornaments. These ornaments belong to Shaku This woman... How could you dare to take my daughter's ornaments! Forget about her, come here. My daughter had to suffer such hardships because of that Jat. I'll kill the bastard. Salim Depute the army on every road. I will not spare that Jat What happened? I saw a dream. I saw that we have reached home. That same door, that same verandah, that same tinkling of anklets your returning from work. You came here for me. Tara Singh, you dog! I will feed you to the dogs! I will torture you so much that even death will tremble Find that Indian bastard! You son of a bitch! You dared to hail India You pig! You are very brave, aren't you? Then come out! He should not escape. Find him! He was praising India Look here, look at these blood stains. He must be here some where find him Burn the whole compartment Have you gone mad? Even my niece Sakeena is with him. You keep quiet, uncle. She has humiliated me. If Sakeena cannot belong to me, she cannot belong to anyone else. Papa, did you see that? Has she regained consciousness? Dot yet. You removed the bullet long ago Then why hasn't she regained consciousness yet? I have done whatever I could Everything is not in the doctor's hands. Pray to God that the medicines work. Please forgive me, son. Do, father Do... A son-in-law is treated royally but I... Please forgive me, son. In my greed for power, I forgot humanity which is the greatest religion of man. You are right, uncle. The world is driven by humanity, by love. Gandhiji has said 'Don violence is the greatest religion'.
