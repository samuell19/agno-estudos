My mother's boyfriend wouldn't let me have breakfast. - Old fucker. Who was it? The bald guy? - No. My mother's boyfriend. - The bald guy's your father. - Yep I got up late, and the asshole wanted me to have lunch... and I needed breakfast, you know... - The first meal of the day. - You get your energy from breakfast. I got dressed and all that shit, was about to make my breakfast and he says: "No, it's time for lunch. What do you want, beef stew or lentils?" "I'll have my breakfast first, bro," I said. And he says: "You don't seem to understand; stew or lentils?" I'd already opened the cupboard to get my plate... and he shut it again and didn't let me get my plate. And again he goes: "Stew or lentils?" So I said: "I'll just go and grab breakfast at my grandma's". And I left pissed off because... - Yeah, the guy thinks he's hot shit. - It's like he's turned against me. I don't know, I just think he's a moron. One of those assholes who got straight B's at school. Right, one of those. And he likes heavy metal... - And he's a stupid fool. - And likes "Star Wars". Exactly, all that shit. - Like a wimp. - One of those assholes. And he walks like this, with his hands like this... - I don't know why. - Like this? Yeah, he's a moron. Fucked up old fart. If you burn it well... it's still good. Hi, how are you? All right... There's a plant that makes women get all wet. Really, it's not a joke. I'm sure if you smoke all the buds you also get wet. - No, I'm serious. - No, man. It's a Rudelaris Cream Caramel. Caramel is good. I'm going to prepare a a terrific indoor weed space. And that will be that. But I won't be selling weed. I'll sell biscuits or milk... - Chocolate... - Shit like that to sell. Not like a drug dealer. And if I make some money and then it becomes legal, I'll have my own edible cannabis shop. I think you'll grow the indoor weed... and as soon as it's ready cut it up and smoke it. - No way. - You're a weed head. - Think you can hold it off? - Yeah. - I got kicked out of my house. - When? - Yesterday. - Yesterday? Why? My grandmother kicked me out. We were having lunch and my brother started fucking around. And I said: "Hey, what the fuck?" And the I spit on his face. And my grandma got angry. So I said: "Right, I'm gone then". And she said: "If you leave don't ever come back, you piece of dogshit!" And I was like laughing cause I had never heard my Gran saying that. - Calling you "dogshit"? - Yeah, I said... "Call me dogshit". - Dogshit. - And I go: "What? Say that again! And she says: "Dogshit". "OK. I'm leaving. See you". Where did your grandmother get that word? I mean, calling you "dogshit"... And I didn't like it. Well, I got laughing but I felt bad. And I said: "OK, I'm leaving then". Because she called me "dogshit". When had my grandma called me that? Never. It's so cool how water can sooth a headache, here on the neck. Fucking sun... Nobody here, bro. Who's gonna stand the fucking heat like us? Some shade in this fucking skate park. A giant tree. They should've put one right in the middle, next to the light. This place is fucking dead. They all died of the skin cancer. - "The" skin cancer! - "The" skin cancer! "The" skin cancer... Is there only one? - We'll end up with fish scales. - I believe you. You've got a lot of tattoos. How many, six? I've got 21 tattoos. Paulie, can I have some of your Fanta to mix with my beer? - You got some saliva on it! - This is fucking good! I used to drink Coke with beer... when I worked at a Peruvian restaurant. - Inca Kola. - No, but it was pretty good. It was kind of weird, but it was good. - Coca Shop! - Peruvian Coca Shop! So good! Damn, that shit was good! Remember I told you I had this mate at school? One day we were in class and I tell the dumb fucker: "Mate, look at my belly button, I don't have a belly button". The dumb ass says: "You don't have a belly button! What happened?" And I say: "I was born with my belly button hanging out. "So they had to stitch me up and now I don't have one". The dude said: "Really? Look, I can squeeze my tits and milk comes out". The moron would squeeze his tits hard and milk came out. - And he was a man. - I don't believe you. I'm serious. I swear by my saintly mother. - Does it come out? Let's see! - Bitch, don't touch me! No milk from me. Grab this and you'll get some milk. You really are fucked! - My mother caught me yesterday. - What? - Selling shit to a dude. - Zopiclone? - No, Clonazepam. - What the fuck? She caught me and screamed at me. She wants me to continue studying. I said no because I want to skate. I got bored, I'm fed up with it this year, man. - Why? Did you quit this year? - That's right. - I wanted to grow some indoor weed. - Yeah, I remember. Now I won't be able to because my mom got on my case with the school stuff. Like she got strict and stuff. Now she won't let me grow my indoor weed and I need it for the food. - Right, cannabis cuisine. - That's what it is. - Illegal. - It's legal! - Yeah, there's a gray area. - Yes, that's it. It's not the same as if you got caught selling the packaged shit. You get it. What kind of cannabis edibles? - All kinds. - Like noodles? - I've considered noodles. - Really? You're shitting me. - With the sauce. You add oregano... - You add dope, coke. You add the buds, so the THC starts to act on the oil, and once the oil is ready, the food gets you high. - Yeah, it clings to the fat. - Exactly. Imagine if weed is legalized, and I start out with a restaurant or some Chinese takeout. But I don't want to work, I want them to work for me. Gotta stay alive. I don't like to be told to do shit. What the fuck were you talking about? Some shit with milk... Once, when I was going to school, I took some milk and a weed biscuit. - Did you make it yourself? - Yeah, I had it for breakfast. Got on the bus and didn't feel a thing. What the fuck? I thought. Around 8:30 I was high as a kite. I was laughing at everything. I fell asleep because I wanted to come down from the high. - Yeah. Did you feel silly? - Yeah, I was kind of slow, tired, incredibly high, melted on my desk. And I woke up when people were about to leave, making noises with the chairs. And I woke with the book marked on my face, and that's the way I went home. I had this red trace and people looked at me as if saying: "This idiot fell asleep". - Were they letters? - Yeah, it was the book cover in relief. The fucking cover... When I got home I had some cannabis milk, a biscuit and I came to skate. You know what happened the other day? The pigs got hold of me. It was 3:30 in the morning and I was high and carrying 150,000 pesos. I had about 10 grams of weed I had bought from Maya, the fat guy. And I was smoking my joint when suddenly the cops stop me. - Holy fuck! - I was really high and kinda drunk. And I was really polite to the cops but they wanted to fuck me over. "What's it going to be? A night in jail or handing over your money?" I had like 130,000 pesos left over. "So, make up your mind". "How can this be? My mother gave me the money". - "OK, hop in". - They're all coked up. - They said: "We'll plant harder stuff on you". - And I was like: "WTF?" "So choose. Either go to jail with the money and the weed, "or give us the money and go home". And I said: "So be it". I gave them the money and furiously went my way. "My money, my money, my money...". I felt so enraged I cried. - Just helpless. - You can't do anything... because the guy has a green fucking uniform and he's a cop. My mom puts me down... She says nothing will come out of all the skating. It's what I really like. She enjoyed going to college... Tell her to go fuck herself! Kick her in the cunt and let her fuck off. Don't talk about my mother like that. - So what? Suck it. - Tough guy, eh? You're nobody, fucking clown. So shut the fuck up, motherfucker. - This fucker is quite the joker. - Joker is your mom on all fours. - No more talk about my mother, asshole! - Shut up you fucking clown. - Stop it with my mom, asshole. - Shut up, clown, or I'll floor you. Stop the talking! - Wanna fight? - Get ready, motherfucker! You get ready! Don't talk about my mother, motherfucker! I'll beat the shit out of you! Come on and try. Try it. This is too much. Touch me again with that shit and I'll waste you, motherfucker. Try it, you son of a bitch. When did I ever talk about your mother? - Shut the fuck up, motherfucker. - Don't talk to me like that either. Fucking clown, now I'm pissed off. - So let's hear it... - Shut the fuck up, motherfucker! - Fucking clown. - Suck it. Let your mother suck it. - PS. - PS, in parenthesis, asterisk... - Let your mother suck it. - Don't be an idiot, Seba. I don't take it from my mom and I won't take it from this fucking fool. I'm not going to get all wound up for nothing. - Is the beer gone? - Yeah. Mother fucking nigger! Son of a bitch drank it all! Fucking asshole. This dude wanted to buy 100,000 pesos worth of weed. He showed me the money and all. I was counting the grams... and suddenly he pushes me back and grabs me by the neck... I don't believe you, bro. He pulls out a revolver and aims it at my face. And suddenly I feel another one here, on my ribs. - Crazy motherfuckers. - And I was fucked. They searched me all over, between my legs... To see if I had a gun, a cellphone... - Fuckers fancied themselves cops. - They took my belt pouch. I had Feromona's GoPro on me. So now I have a debt to pay. I want to sell my indoor weed later, but... damn it... Why don't you wake up to the fact that every time something bad happened... you were all doped up on pills? You've been selling a lot of pills all doped up. If that happens to me when I'm all doped up I wouldn't even mention it. It's happened to you twice. Things are fucked up around here. Really fucked up. The neighborhood stinks. And I don't like this fucking neighborhood. I feel like moving out... to Providencia or further up north. Where, you black mongrel? With that Indian face you got? Cerro Navia for you You're just talking shit. This is your neighborhood. You say it's getting bad, and you're the biggest criminal around. Who are you trying to kid? All because some asshole stole shit from me. Fucking junkies, I'll fuck them up. Fucking idiots, they get me angry. I hate the fuckers. Go up there, the palm tree on the right. The kids are there. Tell them Negro Seba sent you to make a deal with P?a. - I'm like, half gone. - That's it, dude. You have to kind of think these things don't exist. - But they do. - But you have to think they don't. But one day we'll have to quit. When we get a girlfriend and she says: "Don't fuck around with pills anymore". But the thing is not for a chick to change you. - You have to change. - But you know how it is. I don't care if they all find out I pop pills. They already know. My uncle gets them by prescription, to sleep. One a night and he sleeps. Yeah, I know. I'll quit them some day. I had quit them and then the kid dealers gave me some. And I used to say: "no, no, no". But then I popped one and got hooked again. It's fucked up, brother. Yeah, like my mom wanted to commit me to a ward, some shit like that. And I said: "Where...? I'm not a looney to be committed. "They'll give me more pills and I'll end up even crazier!" - It?s like, for your own good, man. - What do you mean? I'm not crazy! You're not crazy but the pills are driving you crazy, bro. Just like you. And what about you, Charly? What are you planning for your future... when you're doing the same shit as me? I had a fight with my mother. I just turned away from that shit and left. Didn't even have my lunch. I'm beginning to see that skating is limited. You're happy for a while, and then... I need to get a steady job now... Even if it's just making 100,000 pesos. They'd get off my case. Just as long as I'm working. Now it's like they see I get up, shower, and go skating... I return at night, have dinner, go to sleep and... - They get on your case. - Contributing nothing and consuming... Anyway, it gets boring after a while. I'm getting too old for this. I left school and should be working right now. That's what I'm going to do, bro, join the fucking system. Fucked up. It's been fucked up from the moment I got to Santiago. You fucked it up because you don't do shit. They left you some money. What did you do with all that money? - You didn't study, you did fuck all. - Yeah... What did you do with the money? You snorted it. - You threw it away! - I threw it away. And now your mom is pissed off for the same reason, because you don't work, you're 21 and do fuck all... Imagine if your mom dies one day. - What would you do without her? - Yeah, you have a point. What would you do? Face life all doped up and high? You know what would be a good rehab? To work, bro, because working you'd know what money is worth, and you'd have to make an effort. Because when I ask you what you're going to do I get a blank stare. You have to find work. But with your attitude... I don't think you'll find a job. Not even close. Hello? Hi! Hello, darling. How's Nachito? - No answer. - He's being breast-fed. - Hey, are you pregnant? - Yeah, did you notice? - I did. - Yep, it's healthy and it'll be a boy, and I think he'll be exceptionally endowed. - Why? Does he have a big thingy? - Yes! - Then he won't be like his father... - Not much. - Like her! Yes, of course. - Just like me. We always say the same stuff, so... - We know it's not like that. - Look Lulo, your wife... - How advanced are you? - Four and a half months. It was really crazy, because I was being careful and all that, then I missed a period. Now I'm fucked. Right! And are you happy or what? - Scared. - She can't even skate! That's right, dude. I can't even skate. What did you expect? I can't drink, I can't smoke. Can't smoke shit, so... One every now and then, just weed. Damn! - My tits have grown a lot. - Tit! Tit. You want tit? Here's some tit! - What a joker. - You're going to be aunt and uncle. - That's good! - Hey, sister. - Take care. - Hugs and kisses. - Take care. - Bye, bye! subs by scalisto
