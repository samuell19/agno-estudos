These are the mountains of Italy where the Germans stopped... the American fit armies' advance in the late winter of 1943. South of San Pietro the 36th division lay pinned down under constant... shell of fire and counter-attack. - Will those Krauts ever run out of ammo? - You hope they don't. When they quit their fires it means they're coming in. 5:20 now. Lieutenant get it? Last night. His personal effects go down with the ammo detail. - You taking over? - Yeah. - Kleiny, your positions are gone? - You told me to, didn't you? - Ammo okay? - Could be better. When the let's get your men on the line. Now, look. This is how I get it doped out. They need to try overrunning us here through the middle... or infiltrating up this ravine...or both. Captain Pepperdine's dug in... on the saddle of this hill and cover our left flank. Now, Mac, you better... Mac. Take your squad down to the bottom of the ravine. - Cover the outpost. - Four men short. We're all short. No sleep, no chow. Six million men in the Army and we do all the fighting. Robinson's got the jitters. Bad. I'm afraid he's gonna blow his top. - Anybody else? - No. - Nobody else. I can make with the others. - I know you can. Are you sure about this ravine deal? I'm not sure about anything except we got a firefight on our hands. - Got a better idea? - Sure. Let's all go home like civilized people and tend our stamp collections. Company's coming. Man, how I hate these mountains. Nothing but hills and mountains. Go ahead, will you? Maybe it works. We'll need more than knocking on wood. I was standing right next to him and I wasn't even touched. Can't do you no harm. Miller, you stick with me. All right, heroes. Come on. All right, let's go. - It'll be a beautiful day. - You hope. Tennis anyone? You think they'll have us again? What's the difference about today? Captain Pepperdine wants you, sir. Red Dog to Pep. Over. We got your left flank covered from the saddle up here, Sergeant. Make sure you're covered by the ravine on your right. Over. We're all set, Captain. If you get into trouble contact me right away. Over and out. They're attacking up there. Hold your fire. Well, that's that. Give me Pepperdine, quick. Captain Pepperdine, come in. Captain Pepperdine, come in. Over. - Any answer? - Not yet. Red Dog to Pep. Red Dog to Pep. Come in, Pep. Hello, Red Dog. It's Major Blackford. What's your situation? Over. Our position's firm. I can't contact Captain Pepperdine on the hill. Over. Pepperdine's dead. His position's overrun. - The enemy is over the saddle. - Hold it, Major. Bobby, the Krauts are up on Pepperdine's hill. They'll be looking down our throats. Move your squad over, quick. - Go ahead, Major. - We've got to get that hill back. We've got to get back before they dig in. You'll attack on signal. Over. We can't attack anyone. We got a bloody nose up here. We only got 20 men left. Over. We're going up too but we've got to have a diversion. Your platoon's the only one in position. Over. Okay, Major. You're aiming to get us funeralized but it's a deal. We're laying more white phosphorus at AJ... while you lead an assault party up there. We'll be coming up the other side. - Anything else? - Yeah, don't stop for any red lights. Get into position. We're facing with battle. Hold on to your teeth. We've got to throw them off from there. With what? Right now we couldn't throw off a light cold. No use for anybody blowing, I've already put in a beef. It's gonna be done and we're the only ones who can do it. - I need ten men. - Right. Miller, Frank, Peters. Come on. On your feet. Give me cover fire. Keep that machine gun busy. Hold on! Blackford's up there. He got it from the rear. Get them down. I was just beginning to wonder what's your favorite hymn was. I never thought I'd be so glad to see you either, sir. You did a great job. Magnificent. "Molto buono." You forget about that. I get you a good hot shower when you get back to camp tonight You heard right. We're being pulled out. Replaced. Don't kid me, Maj. I don't even replace the dead up here. - We have a lot of that, haven't we? - Yeah, we collect. You see, the relief's already at your position. - We pull out in an hour. - What? - I don't believe it. - If nothing else happens. To us? What else can happen? You know, the real battle begins. Those beautiful Neapolitan women. "La bella ragazza." Five days and five nights with them. If you aren't tired enough, the trucks will be waiting on other side of the mountain. Do you think we can walk that far? We didn't exactly use to walk towards the rear. But I bet we can catch on quick enough. Let's go. Now, how about this? You're alive, ain't you? We're being pulled out, ain't we? What do you want? Miracles? No good rear area knuckleheads... couldn't get the mail up here tonight. Last year when we were in Oran I got a Christmas card for Easter. And in Sicily I got a letter telling me to keep away from them Arab girls. Mosses, that's what we are. All of us, sleeping mosses. All the time in the line I planned... how I was going to tear up Naples from miles around. I'm so bushed I can't even stand up. Go to sleep. Maybe you can dream up a redhead. I'm too tired. It'll have to be a brunette. Well, that's the Army for you. See a tourist camp. Well, I assure it is all you can do. And by the time the spirit and flesh are both willing... zip...back to the foxholes. Ah, you can't win. If it ain't the K-rations, you don't get it. If it's in the K-rations, who wants it? - Attention! - Rest, boys. - You guys getting along alright? - Yes, sir. - Your bunks are okay? - Fine, sir. What gal's keeping you up? Miller's mother. He was my runner. I've got a lot of those to write too. - Have a good night's sleep. - Thank you, sir. - Good night, sir. - Hey, Pete. The light? - Yeah, okay. - Clean beds're sure gonna shut us tonight. - Good night, you farmer. Never too late to go to town, eh Sergeant? - Which way is that? - Can't miss it. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to startle you. Startle me? You almost scared me to death. Thought you were one of these... What were you...? Those are ours. Yeah, I know. You just pull in? Yeah, something like that. - It's been awful up there, hasn't it? - Awful is a word. I'm sorry, I never discussed the war on Tuesdays. - This is Wednesday. - It is? Well, Wednesdays too. - Malaria? - No, girls. I guess I've forgotten how to talk to them in cemetery. Specially lieutenants. What are you doing here? Loading a little precious time into myself. It's quiet here. Yeah, you can say that much for them. They're quiet alright. - Know somebody here? - Somebody. - Important? - Very. It's a long story. The dead were supposed to watch out over the living and not... - I'm sorry. - Don't be. - Who you are looking for? - Nobody special. We all went to same beach party together. The whole bloody boat hasn't worth any single one of them. - It was a great victory. - So I heard. Man should die with his feet dry at least. What? - You're a strange man. - Only to strange women. - Come on, let's get a drink. - Let's not. But thanks. Why not? Oh, I get it. You're taken that sort of big, aren't you, Lieutenant? And another things. Take care of yourself. Oh, sure, sure. I forgot I was in the rear echelon area. Looks like I'll have to get me some chevron polish. I think some sleep and a good night's rest. Thanks, lieutenant. I'll take it up with my chaplain. Oh, boy! Hot water and soap. Ain't it wonderful? Not so loud! If they find out we're enjoying it, they put it off-limit. I met you in a sunny day, my darling. Hey, Kleiner, give me the soap, will you? Don't be so stingy. I'm as dirty as you are. - When did you get in the Army? - 1942. Seems to me you came a little late. We get you by two years. - Come on, you've done it enough. - Catch. Look, what you've done. Now, where is it? I can't find it. He found it. Give the man a Purple Heart. He's wounded. Hey, Joe Pete! Come on, mail call! - I don't know anybody who can write. - No family? Never used them. Not so fast. Before you leave camp I wanna straight out a few things. This is it: You'll find place where G.I.'s ain't allowed. Stay out of them. What's the matter? You've got the stake down for yourself? All right, all right. Stay out of fights and don't get into sauce. You get that? Yeah, it's simple. No babes, no brawls, no booze and no breedin'. You'd be there between 11 and 17 hundred hours. That that ain't here, ain't eatin'. All right, all right. Remember that that ain't here, ain't eatin'. All right, all right... Sergeant Peterson! Come on running! Come on, let's get that mail inside. You're going to Caserta at 9 hundred hours. General Clark wants to see you. Yeah, I was wondering how long it'd be before he'd ask me... how to run this war. Seems he stuck with a certain gold bars, lieutenant. - What? On the level? - Yeah, on the level. Matter of fact, come to think of it, I just happen to have my old bars with me. You might as well have them. Well, I can honestly say is it couldn't happen to a nicer fella. - Grazie. - Prego, tenente. Say, Maj. How long they had WAC's around here? - Why? - I met one in the cemetery. Three weeks. How did you make out? - Don't remind me. - Get in before you break my heart. Mamma Mia's famous for a veal piccata, Lasagna Milanese... and the two beautiful daughters. Take my advice, order the daughters. Well, I order them for dessert. Come on. These guys'll take all the dames. Let them buy the wine. We'll pour. What a place, Naples. Big as Boston. - And the gals are developed too, ain't it? - Yeah, boy. Mamma mia! Acres and acres of women and all of its mine. Never mind that. - Hello, Joe. - Hello. - Hello Joe. What's your name? - Joe. - What's yours? - Joe. Two Joe. - You like come in? - Why not? You want to sit down and have a nice glass of wine? You're just what my draft board promise. Sure. - You speak Italian? - No. I don't know what it is but I love it. Look into those eyes. You'd think it fell out of a high window. - Viva la high windows! - Viva. Boy, I asked you. Why? Put this in the deep freeze. I'll be back. I don't think you can freeze that. What's up, Smiley? Oh, Pete, you're the only friend I got left in the world, I guess. - Come on, tell your old uncle. - Something's wrong, Pete. Bad wrong. She promised she'll make a novena for me every month... and write me a letter every day. Ah, don't worry. She's still writing. No, Pete. Not that. She's forgotten me. It's not unusual. She's young and beautiful. And I'm old and bald. - No letter, Pete. - Probably the mail system got all flopped up somewhere. Come on. Paying a cigarette, nylon and chewing gum. Hold the arm, babe. See? You gotta know how to talk. Ain't I tell you? - You buy me chocolate. And nylon. Bubblegum. - Si. - Give these to the major for signature. - Yes. - Jack, we're trying to locate some mail. - What outfit, sir? 2nd batallion, 143th infantry, 36th division. What outfit, sir? Sir?! Hey, they've got these rear echelon boys trained. Calling a sergeant sir. Great improvement. Your mail was picked up by your supply sergeant this morning. I know but he may have overlooked some of it. The address was all fouled up. What did you give it to the supply sergeant, huh? Never did trust that guy, Barker. Why didn't you give it to the mail clerk? - Check again, will you? - Yeah, check again. - What seems to be the trouble here? - Well. - I don't believe it. Hello. - I asked you what the trouble was? Well, you see, Lieutenant. The boy here got himself a brand new letter opener... and he's just crazy to try it on some mail from the wife. - His name's McFee... - That's it, Sarge. Give her a growl and let's blow. That's all flopped up anywhere if women are handling. - Take it easy, Mac. WACs ain't women. - Ah, ain't? They're officers and gentlemen. Congress said so. Don't let that fool you. They said the same things about you, Lieutenant. Lieutenant? Hey, Sarge, tell her how we feel about lieutenant... Lieutenant? Lieutenant? Holly Maggie Murphy! On the level? On the level. Now I know. The man in the cemetery. The what? You said you're going to get some chevron polish but I didn't anticipate this. - I said a lot of things last night. - Yes, I know. I'm terribly sorry I didn't recognize you but...you look so different. Yeah, I put on my other head today. - How about it? - I'm sorry, sir. Lieutenant, I'm looking for you. Would you be interested in dinner and the ballet tonight? Oh, I'm sorry, Colonel, but I can't. There's so much to be done here tonight. Some of the mail got all flopped up. - Oh, now, that couldn't be that important. - Sir, I think the mail is ver... Besides, Colonel, there's something about grown-up men in tights... chasing muscular women across the stage. - Another time, perhaps. - I'd be delighted, thank you. My pleasure. Who you're holding out for? General Clark? I thought it was only sergeants you brushed off. Rude lieutenants too. Can I buy you a drink? - Of what? - Is that a refusal? - No, it's a deal. When? - I'm just on my way out. How about now? How come? - You invited me last night and I was very rude, wasn't I? - Who isn't? And besides, how often can one celebrate a battlefield commission? Come on, Mac. - Where do we go? - Not much choice. If there's anything get to eat or drink in this town Mamma Mia's got it. Well if she's got it, we'll get it. - Lovely fellows're easy to please. - Sound like you're glad to be alive. I am but then I'm easy to please. How about you? I'm hungry. - I'm still waiting, Pete. - Okay, Mac. Two vinos. Hello, good-looking. I waited for you. Hello...Goodbye. Hey, Pete, wait a minute. Where have you been? The women wait and the women weap. - Maj., this is Lieutenant... - MacKay. Eleanor MacKay. Elly MacKay, that's nice. Lieutenant MacKay, Major Blackford. - By the way my name is... - Oh, I know. "Good-looking". That's only my first name. The other is Peterson. Friends usually call me Joe Pete or Pete or... my old man's best friend. What are you drinking? Oh, not that vino. Mamma presses out that with her socks on. Some of Mamma's best, ha? - Will you excuse us, Lieutenant? - Of course. Sit down. Right here. - Pete, what's with that WAC? - Easy, easy. Take it easy, Maj. We only got a few days. You wanna waste it on her? How do you know it will be wasted? Look, you can tell me I don't know what end of the rifle the bullets comes out, okay. Tell me I don't know what time a day it is, okay. But don't tell me about women. You look into that girl's eyes and all you see is your sister, your mother... I looked. I didn't see anybody I know. You've been up on that hills too long, boy. You're loosing your touch. You're gonna blow your entire leave. That's what. She's a wife character. My first wife... She is. And I'm gonna lose her real quick. - Quicker than that. - Go to Ritz. Mamma Mia! Hey, you forgot something. You owe me a drink, remember? - We were going to celebrate. - You can celebrate with the major. Now, don't be offended. He's an old buddy from Seattle. I was just humoring him. Man talk, you know? I know. I think it only fair to tell you that your old buddy was unfortunately quite right. About your prospects with me, I mean. - You would be wasting your time. - Let me do some of the worry. Only not here. I've borrowed the old buddy's jeep. - I see. Just a drink? - Anything you say, babe. Eh, Lieutenant. Took the Army to teach me things about myself that I never knew before. Things I was afraid of but I could do anyway, things I could leave alone. It is a nice feeling to find out nice things about oneself. - Like what? - Oh, like...Not having to be dependent. - Not having to lean on others. - Men? Men. People. - You hate men. - Do I? The way you say it. Do you? I hate, whatever it is, that's turning this into a nation of scavengers and beggars... and street walkers for something to eat. It's degraded every relationship between man and woman into something... worth three cigarettes and no more. It's made love a dirty word. I know, I know. That's war. We didn't start it and the boys are lonely and maybe kill tomorrow or the day after. Nobody lives forever so let's live all we can while we can and... - That's right. - That's very right. But I don't have to like it. I don't want to live that way. And I don't want anybody else to have to live that way either. Those little girls walking up and down on the Via Rome, DDT in their hair. Poor little... - Why am I telling you all this? - Why not? The wine's good. The music's good. Maybe it's just time you told somebody. - Well, what do you like to do now? - Let's don't go into that again. How would you like to see the ballet tonight? I thought you didn't go for those men chasing muscular women. Maybe the women will chase the men tonight. I guess not. Oh, I promised you a drink remember? You know, that's what I like about you. You're such a perfect gentleman. It's gonna rain. - How can you tell? Rheumatism? - I'm an old farmer's daughter. You are? You mean you were a civilian once? - If you consider school teacher civilian. - You? Honest? Well, and me without an apple. Is that you? I haven't smelled anything so good since... Rain in Italy isn't nearly as nice as rain in a pond in New Hampshire. It'll be mud up there tonight and deep and freezing cold. Poor dog faces will get there... - Where is this pond? - Just behind our house. In Sirties. Nobody's ever heard of it, nor seen it, I guess. - You sure there is such a place? - Oh, it's there all right. If you look for it. - Sirties. - Lot's of trees. Lot's of quiet. Real pretty in the summer. And on Sundays the smell of good cooking. The whole family there. Everybody's talking at once. Sounds wonderful. Do you like your family? Okay, I'm prejudiced. They're my family and I'm sentimental about them. I even have every doll what ever given to me up in my attic. What? Nothing. I...just wanted to touch you. So I miss them like... Why? Just because I felt like it, that's all. No reason. What are you doing here anyway? How come you joined up? How come anybody? Because they had to. They get away from something. Not you. What are you doing so far from Sirties? A girl like you? I thought the uniform would match my eyes. How does one say it without making noble sounds? Maybe there's a way of life that doesn't need God or love or family. But I need all three. Thank you. I'd like to be able to go back to Sirties... and feel that I helped keep this place, the street free and safe. Your eyes shine in the dark. - What are they? Blue or black? - Mostly blue. I don't think blue and khaki match. - What's that for? Good conduct. - Very good. Bragging or complaining? - It is where you get funny? - Don't rush me. - Is it? - I'm thinking about it. You know I've always wanted to be slapped by a gal with mostly blue eyes. Now you tell me that you've never felt this way about any other woman. I've always felt this way about any woman. Lieutenants I don't know about. Come on, put your arms around me. You might get to like it. Yes. I might. - Having trouble, Lieutenant? - Plenty. - Need a push? - No, thanks. It won't help. The road's clear now you... Sorry, sir. Say thanks for being saved from a fate worse than. - Thank you. - Sergeant. Sergeant Fred Miller. Thanks, Sarge. You know why everybody hates sergeants? Sure. Because they may become lieutenants. - I like you. - I like you too. The Loving Faith must take to build something like that. "La bella chiesa." All the emotion and vitality they pour into everything. The music, the language... "Con tutto cuore." With all my heart. Do you know any other? I know that you're a "tenente". A nice one. For which you say "grazie". Thank you. And I know "vino" and "spinachi"... That's for spinach. - Is there any more? - "Meraviglioso, tenente." Marvelous. Isn't it a wonderful language? The extraordinary rightness of "Cara mio" for example. - The feeling. - What is that mean? - Come on, teacher. - It means "dear one". That's what I thought it meant. Smile when you say that. It's just a way of addressing someone. It's like saying you are "Giuseppe Pietrasone". I like "cara mio" better. "Eleonora." Hey, you got good teeth. You ought to laugh more. - They don't scare you much, do you? - Me? Bomb? 'Course not. They just terrified me. Is it true that you never hear the one that gets you? - Pete... - Don't say anything. Let's get out of here. I think it's all over now. - Don't think so much. - No, Pete. No! You can't go out there. Wait! - Elly! Elly, are you all right? - I think so. Why are you fighting, Elly? Why? I'm not going to fall in love with you, Pete. I'm not. Not this way. You want me to say love? Is that what you want? - Okay, I'll say it. - And you'll be gone tomorrow or the next day. That'll be the end of it. I can't live that way, Pete. I'm not going through life... counting graves. I can't. Can't you understand that? I can understand you want me to keep my hands off you. Leave you alone. All right. I just thought I want to live my life decently. Without shame or disgust or serious regrets... Never mind try to explain it. I probably wouldn't understand it anyway. We're not hooked each other. So what are we knocking ourselves out for? - This is where you live? - Used to be a convent. I might have known. - Pete, you must understand. There was another boy. - Don't tell me. I met him in Oran. I almost married him. He's buried where I met you. I thought you ought to know. Sort of late, isn't it, Lieutenant? That's my battalion commander. I have to go now. Yeah, she might take away your good conduct ribbon. Will I see you again? What for? I'd only grab at you again. You'd only make me feel like some kind of creep. You'd give me a bad time. No, I think I'll save my fighting for the Germans. - Good night. - Good night. And just as I was kissing her she said, "Soldier Boy, why you no marry me... - and send me back to America?" - What did you do? I said, "Honey if I could send anybody back to America, it would be me." Attention! Say, Lieutenant, how did you make out with the new bars? Have a ball? Natch. Come on, Pete, I'll help you move your stuff over the officer's tent. I'm bushed, I'll do it tomorrow. - "Darling Emilia". - Oh, it take a few minutes, Pete. - I said tomorrow. - Okay, okay, Lieutenant. Good night, Pete. "And it's been weeks and weeks since I heard from you, honey. And it's getting me down. But, Emilia, I haven't touched a drop for weeks and weeks. Honest. All my love, Mac". Breakfast is the meal that counts. Fish, salami, cheese, wine... That's the way you get a day off. Mamma let me take you away from all this. You and I should open a little Italian restaurant in New Jersey. Me, you, restaurant? You bad boy. He's real nutty, isn't he? Aren't we all naughty boys and naughty girls? Except "Tenente Eleanor MacKay". All the rest of us are wicked. He's a good boy. Hey, Pete. Hey, Pete, look. Excuse me, Major. Look, five letters, all in one time. The latest picture of her. - Same woman? - The baby. She promised me she'll write and she did. I never thought for a minute she wouldn't. Hey, Major, the drinks are on me. I'm buyin'. Excuse me a minute. Waiter! The guy's ready for a Section Eight. - How can one woman make you that happy? - He's in love. - With his wife? - That's what a college education'll do to you. Major, do you ever have a woman look at you... and that look get inside of in and kick you out in there? All the time. Every time you saw the same thing happy? - What is that? Love? - "No capisce". Me neither. - What do you think love is anyway? - Nothing. And what else is it? I don't know. A guy meets a gal. He thinks he can't live another day without support her for the rest of his life. Maybe that's love. Ask a woman should tell you something else. Yeah but you don't ask her. I've had enough of this. - What's eating you? That WAC? - Not a chance. All 36th division men're ordered away. - And those are the orders. - What order? All leaves had been cancelled. A truck's waiting outside to take you guys back to camp. Let's go. We only got two days. We supposed to get five. What's the idea? Don't ask me. I don't work here. - It didn't give you a chance to... - I warned you last night. Time was a waste. Yeah. Go on, 36th, on the double. Get in. Come on. Let's get going there. What's your address? I want to write you. What's your address? I've got to go, Angelina. - Hey, what was her address? - I don't know. I wasn't listening. All right, Mac, come on. Let's go, let's go. All right, buddy. Come on, no stalkin'. Corporal, where can I locate Lieutenant MacKay? I wouldn't know, sir. Is there anything I can do for you? Yeah, only you wouldn't do it. Sorry, Lieutenant. You have to report right away. - Yeah, I heard. - The truck's outside, sir. - Okay, thanks. - Let's go, fellas. - All right, pal. You happen to know where Lieutenant... - Looking for someone, Lieutenant? - Yes, Major. Where can I find Lieutenant MacKay? I wouldn't know. Lieutenant MacKay has a cold. An ordinary cold. But Colonel Traill felt that his duty to drive her down to medical officer in person. - Any message? - No, thanks. Colonel wouldn't like it. Anyhow, it's probably better this way. Undoubtedly. Well, say something. So I know this isn't all in my head. Why don't you smile like you're glad to see me? - Aren't you supposed to be sick? - Not really... - How did you know? - I went looking for you. - I wish you'd found me. - With the Colonel? Pete, you can't be thinking anything like that, not about old Traill. He arranged my coming up here with the last mail, so I could see you. I know I shouldn't be here but I just couldn't let you go back... without seeing you again. - Is that wrong? - How could you do anything wrong? Let's get out of here and lose the galley. I thought it all over last night. You were right. No love. You don't want it. I don't want it for sure. I don't even know what it is. Why don't you tell me to go away? - Because you might. - I couldn't. How badly I wanted to hold you just once before I left. I want to be with you, talk with you. I want to fight with you and dance with you. I guess there isn't anything I ever wanted with any woman, but I don't want, just with you. - What are we getting into, Pete? - There's nothing to cry about it. It's all settled. I want you and you want me. So I'm off to throw a grenade where it will do the most good... and fire a rifle where it'll do the most good. Is that makes sense? - When will you leave? - In couple of hours. - Let's walk. - Pete... - Let's walk, Elly. If anything would happen to you, I don't know what I do. Nothing's gonna happen to me. - Not after Salerno and Volterno. - Maybe I'll change your luck. Maybe I'll put a jinx on you. Some people do that. I'll put a hex on you... Not a chance. I'm going to live forever because of you and not longer. And as long as I live... Maybe it's better this way. Maybe if I hang around it would die. No, it wouldn't. Nice knowing somebody cares what happens to you. There's an old saying. - Pete, don't! - That's for luck to keep me alive. So we can come back and get it out. That's what he said just before he left Oran. "For luck", he said. Yeah, I know. But only the good die young and... - No good, Pete. Very good. - That's just a rumor I started. You are. I couldn't love you so. Don't say things like that. I'm liable to believe them. I never thought I'd ever find you. What are we going to do, Pete? We could get married on my next leave. We could... - Say no. Tell me how crazy that would be. - Sure it's crazy. And the midst of all this planning the future, our life together, permanent... It's more than crazy. But that's nothing I want more. When is your truck go back? I don't know, doesn't matter. Don't send me away, Pete. Not yet. We can get through to them if we can eliminate that roadblock. - We had a stop call for a week. - Why not layin' artillery? We have been layin' it for two days. That may have done it and then again or they're maybe too well dug in. Only one way to find out. You've got to hit them fast and hit them hard. Why me? Why my platoon? Why not one of the other outfits? I picked your platoon because it's the best one for the job. I'll be coming behind you with armor. I'll direct operations from the lead tank. - Any questions? - No, sir. See you in San Pietro. Here, sign this. - What's this? - Permission to get married. - It's regulations. - You flip your leg and you're going... Maybe I'll come out of it. Sign it, will you? That's San Pietro? That little flat spot holding us up? Sure that there's an old bell in that church. "La bella chiesa." Huh? Nothing. I thought I told you keep those men spread out. Okay. All right, you guys, spread out. It looks those Krauts dug in for the winter. Get rid of your coats. Like running in a potato race. - Yeah, more trouble wear them. - Who packed them? The Major, sir. Snow White to Little Flower. Come in, Little Flower. - What's holding you up? - They got us pinned down. I'll let you know when the road's clear. Over and out. They cover the roadblock from that farmhouse. Mac, get the third squad around the right. Kleiny, help them from the other side. Sure, yeah. Get your squad and follow me. Third squad, we're movin' out! All right, men. Let's move. - What we'll do, Lieutenant? Wreck them? - We stay here. Get them covering fire. All right, you guys. On the ground. I've been on the ground so much I feel like a loafer. Watch out 3p-mines and Bouncing Betties. This joint's lousy with them. Hold it. All right, move out. Tell the Major, he can bring up his tin cans now. Snow White to Little Flower. Snow White to Little Flower. Come in. Snow White to Little Flower. Snow White to Little Flower. Mac, Kleiny. There they are, two of them. 88th's. If we got those tin cans under observation, we could clean that road. That's murder, pure murder. Hey, Pete, those guns ain't more than 200-300 yards away. Let's take them. Like the time we jumped those 88th's in Caiazzo. What's the matter, hero? You want to get us all killed? Communications. Pete, those tanks're like sitting ducks. If we'd draw their fire go... We'd be caught sight of in daylight. Take it easy, this isn't your last chance to die. - How about that phone? - Yes, sir. Give me Artillery, quick. This is Snow White. I've got those tank guns spotted. Request artillery fire 500 yards North, 200 yards East. The farmhouse's number two. Urgent. Okay, give me the exact map coordinates. Burst was 200 yards short and 100 yards right of target. Repeat. That's the lead tank. The Major's in that tank. Give me that! Snow White to Little Flower. Snow White to Little Flower. Come in. Snow White to Little Flower. Come in. Come in, Little Flower! - Come on, let's get them. - Protect the farmhouse! Here. Frank. They got us zeroed in. Medic, medic! Get the medic up here! Come on, Pete. We'll have you fixed up in a jiffy. - Here, let me help you. - Get that platoon out of here. - Go on, get them out of here. They got us zeroed in. - But, Pete... - That's an order, farmer. - Okay. - How are you, my son? - Leave me alone. Blessed to see you soon. Who? - Is that thing say how long I've been here? - 15 days. Is there anybody you want notified? No. - Who's the farmer? - Who? The farmer you keep talking about him. And someone that sounds like Maj. - Am I supposed to take that? - Yes. Okay, give it to me. - How about it, doc? - Your leg's healing fine. - If that's all right with you. - You gotta get me out of here, doctor. I will if you let me. - Nurse tells me you don't eat properly. - I'll eat, just get me out of here. What's your hurry? People die in bed, doc. You ought to know that. - Nobody loves a dead man. - You have a visitor. A Lieutenant Eleanor MacKay. - She's got the wrong guy. - But she said that she want... I don't want to hear it. I don't want to see anybody. I'm sorry to disappoint you, Lieutenant, but you're not going to die. At least not just yet. Not here. - How come I'm not getting any better? - You've got to want to. What's that supposed to mean? Let me find to think you don't want to get well. I don't know what happened up there that you can't bear to thinking about. But I do know there's something. And it's not the leg. You're just guessing, doc. And you're wrong, dead wrong. There's nothing like that. I'm just sick of it, that's all. Sick of the mountains and the mud. Sick of killing. Sick of making buddies. Well, what's the difference? I'm no hero. I just want to get out of here, that's all. I just want to go someplace where the sleeping is good... without things knocking around in my head. - What things? - Only for a moment, Lieutenant, it's late. I had to hear it from you. Do you want me to go away? Why didn't you let me know? I don't want anybody worrying, asking a lot of questions. I won't. If you just tell me. - The Major's dead. - I'm sorry. He was in the lead tank. It was too late. Is it bad, Pete? Food's pretty bad. But the company's improving. Pull up a bed, make yourself at home. - How did you know? - The mail section knows everything. Eventually. Darling, tell me, are you all right? Why don't you smile like you're glad to see me. - Are you still my girl? - I'm not very bright. I wouldn't know what else to be. - How have you been, Elly? - Oh, it's been easy for me. I have a system. One week I loved you quietly, sanely. The next week I loved you furiously. Just this moment I love you greatfully. Blessingly, too. How soft your smile is. Time's up, Lieutenant. You suppose we'll ever be alone? You suppose I'll ever find out what you're like out of that uniform? - I don't think I could stand it. - Stay with me. You'll be safe. Get well, my love. - Hello. - Hello, Pete. Someone answered my prayers. Reclassify. That means no more combat. That's wonderful news, Pete. - When do you leave? - Three days to repo depot. Probably Oran. Maybe back to the States. Three days. It's better than two days and no days at all, isn't it? Just think, Pete. Three whole days to do as we wish. - Where does that happen? - We'll find a way. Someplace private and untouched. That place's a million miles away. Another world. Where people live without uniforms and regulations and orders. - It's a dream, Elly. - What I feel for you, that's no dream. The war's no dream either. Do you think it's a big swindle just to keep us apart? We'll outswindle it. Lea, I'd like you to meet Lieutenant Peterson. And this is Lea Maduvalli. - How do you do? - How do you do? I've heard much about you, Lieutenant. Lea, I'm going to ask you a favor, tremendous favor. I'm going to accept your invitation to visit your family. - It's no favor, I've already invited you. - For three days. It would be an honour. I can make it in 20 minutes. It's not far. Excuse me now. Will they mind in the hospital? I couldn't make them happier. - How about you? - I saved on my leave... until we got back. I'll see the Major about getting a jeep. If you're not here when I get back, I'll take the hint. Would you come in, please? My grandmother. She doesn't see or hear too well. My mother and father. How do you do? She used to work in Hotel Excelsior for the touristry. She knows how to write and read in English. I try. Welcome to our poor house. Oh, thank you very much. You are too good. I go show my friends. Thank you very much. Italians are sometimes very emotional. Giorgio was my husband. He fought with the "partigiani". Partisans, you say. They say she's been here longer than the mountains. Come, see your rooms. Yes? Lea, do you have an old glasses skirt I could wear? Just to see what I look like out of the uniform. Oh, yes. I'll show you what I have. Well? I don't know, you look young. Younger... I mean different. Oh, Pete. How old are you, Elly? I don't even know. I was 23 the week before Easter. You know, you look younger too. Younger than 26 in June? - Doesn't change anything, does it? - How could it? Well, I could grow a moustache. That might help. What would you do? Oh, I think I'll just let time take care of that. - Where were you? - Down the church. I figured that a real pretty one. Well, we'll need a priest if we're going to get married, won't we? You're just saying that to make me cry. How long do these shindigs go on? - Oh, sometimes three or four days. - Three or four days? Then it'll be time to go back and we never... Never what? Be alone. How do I know what kind of wife do you make? I don't even know if you can cook or sew or whether you'll be jealous. I can cook and I can sew and I'll be terribly jealous. I'll be a wonderful wife, Pete. Hold me like you're afraid none of this is true. - Is it true, isn't it? - Yes, it's true. And I'm even more surprised than you are. Possibly is this dress. First chance I get I'm going to get you some fine things of your own. Black lace ones. Lots of diamonds, expensive ones. Soon as I figure out what to use the money. We use money for money. Oh, Pete, we'll have a wonderful life. I wish I had a throne I could toss away for you... or a title or even a lousy little career. I don't even have a family to take you home to. I married you, Pete. Not a family. All I've got is a gun and a pack and a war that's going on... We are not going to talk about it, remember? We're not even going to think about it. - Stay close to me, Elly. - I will. Can you hear my heart? I thought it was mine. It's good to walk anywhere we feel like going. No mission, no orders, no regulations, no map coordinates. Nothing. And it gives me a chance to show you off. It gives me a treat. - Hello. - Good morning. - What are you thinking? - Just then? About when I was a kid. How I always had to be going places, doing things. And now all I want is to stay put. How lucky I am. - And how all good things come to an end. - Bad things too. It isn't ended yet. Not until tomorow. Pete, those tanks are like sitting ducks. It's murder, pure murder. That's the lead tank. The Major's in that tank. Pete. - What is it? - Nothing, Elly. Go back to sleep. What's bothering you, Pete? Is it me? Is it too strange sleeping with someone beside you? - Some people never get used to it. - It's the quiet. Everything's sliding by so quietly, so peacefully. Like the rest of the world died and left us. Maybe the war is over. Maybe it's all over. - Only we'd never know it up here. - We'd know it soon enough. It'll be light soon. Look at the mist mooving down over the valley. Good for an attack. I dreamed I was talking to them. Kept seeing them die. - Kept hearing them. - You cried out in your sleep last night. Elly, you got to know... I'm not reporting to the repo depot. I'm going back where I belong. - Back? Into action? - I've got to. - Why? Your order said limited... - I've got to, Elly. Why, Pete? How can I tell you? I've got to sleep nights. But I couldn't hold up some... place behind the desk while they're still up there short-handed and green troops. - Why, Pete? Why? - I told you why. If you don't want me to go, say no and I won't. - Don't say that, Pete. Don't ask me... - 'Cause I wouldn't hurt you for anything. I wouldn't be any good up there worrying about you. I might let somebody else die like I let the Major die. You never did anything like that. How could you? Playing it safe. Cagey. It would've been too late anyway. I know that but I can't feel it. I'm alive...and he's dead. That's why I didn't want to see you at the hospital. And Yost is dead. He was trying to help me. He didn't have to. - Now, what are you thinking? - I think you must go. What else do you want me to say? Only that everything'll be all right. Only that we'll always be all right. I only know that I'm a woman who found something, she couldn't stand loosing. She's not gonna loose anything, don't you know that? It's like you said. There's a certain kind of life you want. That needs love, god, family. Well, I want it too. Going back doesn't mean I don't love you. I've got to go because I do love you. And wherever I go... you'll be there with me. - This is a rotten way to end a honeymoon. - Is there a good way? Maybe when we get to Rome if we ever get... We'll get to Rome or somewhere else. Doesn't matter, we'll be together. Believe that, Pete. Don't worry about me. I won't, Elly. "Cara mia." Good luck! God bless you. As you say, sir. If we crossed it once, we can cross it again. River crossing is getting to be our speciality. Who let you in here? Make it short. - Lieutenant Peterson's reporting, sir. - Reporting for what? Don't you know better to do? You're the Peterson who got at San Pietro? Yes, sir. Weren't you transferred to the repo depot? It seems to me I saw your orders. I'd like permission to rejoin my outfit, sir. You mean you've gone AWOL from the replacement depot? - There was a mistake in my order, sir. - Answer my question. - Have you or have you not gone AWOL? - Well, sort of. You see... Sort of isn't the way we run an army, Lieutenant. You got hit on the head or something? Just touched, I guess. This blasted rain must be softened my brain. If we weren't short of seasoned men I'd... Permission granted. Get out of here and report to your batallion commander. Yes, sir. Get me Major Blakesley, second batallion. - Is that your rifle? - Yes, sir. Take it up. - You new here? - I've come up last night. I was in the truck with you, sir. Take care of your rifle, soldier. You'll need it if we're gonna walk back down that hill again. Yes, sir. - Hey, Pete! - It's Pete! Hey, what are you doing back here? Ain't you had enough of this? I had plenty. They told me they need a good man up here. They sure do. Where is he? - Come on. - You certainly picked a good time, Pete. - We're crossing over the Rapido. - Again? That's where I came in. Hold it, I said! I better go take a look. You stay here and cover us. Come on, Brownie. - What do you see, sir? - Rome. Rome? I don't see nothing but another beat up village and more mountains. Yeah but over those mountains' Rome. Fall out! That town is crawling with German tanks. Fall out? Pete's gone in there. Fall out, steadfast. Captain's orders. Pete... Crawl back! Crawl back! Tell McFee to swing his squad around the left flank... up to the edge of that next street. When he's in position, I'll signal. And Kleiny will coming from the right. Get going. - Hello, Lea. - Hello, how you feel? Wonderful. Disgustingly wonderful and disgustingly happy, too. You know, you dream and you hope and you wait for all good things... to happen to you and all of a sudden they're happening. It's better than a dream, much better. - Did you find anything for me? - No. I used to praise the efficiency of our mail service. If I'll not hear about Pete soon, I'll take it all back. Excuse me, Lieutenant, Major Walton wants to see you. - Major Walton. - You've been out, Lieutenant? Yes, I had some dinner, took a walk and did a little shopping. And saw a doctor? Sit down. Thank you. Don't you know it's against regulations for military personnel... - to go to see civilian doctors? - I know. - I think I can explain. - There's no need to. I'm fully aware that the Army is not stacked with obstetricians. He called me. He was anxious to stay out of trouble. He said you're strong and healthy. - Yes, I know. - You know what this means, don't you, Eleanor? It means... It means I'm going to have a baby. It means you'll have to be separated from the service. I can arrange transportation back. - No. No, you can't, please. - I'm sorry, child. My hands are tied, you know that. I can't go against regulations. Besides you'll want to be with your family. I want to be with my husband. I want to see his face when I tell him. He doesn't know? Haven't you been writing him? Every day, but not about his. I can't have him worrying about me. That's what happened before at San Pietro. That's why he had to go back to prove to himself. Major don't make me go back, not just yet. Can't you just charged me here? I'll accept full responsibility. I can't leave Italy with Pete's still here. We have a date in Rome. Won't be long now. Please. Yes, Corporal? What is it? I'm sorry, Major. There's a sergeant out here looking for Lieutenant MacKay. - I can't see anyone now. - He asked for Mrs. Peterson. Must be somebody from Pete's outfit. Where is he? - McFee. - How are you, Lieutenant? - Major Walton I want... - You've been hurt. Pleasure, it's sending me home. You won't mind about the mail being flopped up then, will you? How is Pete? What's wrong? What happened to him? Tell me McFee! They should have notified you. I'd never come barging in here like... Tell me! Well, we were out on this patrol, town called Veletri. Kraut tanks overran us and Pete was lost. Is he dead? Pete's dead? Don't say it. - You saw it? - Like I told you, we had to call out fast. He was reported missing in action. - Presumed dead. - Presumed? Who presume such things? He can't be dead. I'm real sorry. I just wanted to see you... He can't be dead! - They have notified me, wouldn't they? - Of course, they would. They have to notify you when it's your husband, don't they? I'll have someone drive you back to your barracks, child. You know, I'm just thinking about what I'll get when the captain finds out... I'm hauling a WAC up here. - You know, you got no business being here. - I know. I know it'll going into your records. I got records for everything, except... I got records for everything, period. I know, I've been hauling 'em. Truck load on truck load. One of your trucks had been delayed. Record I'm looking for hasn't reached Caserta. You ain't goin' up to headquarters, are you? Division and regiment... - Veletri. - There was Veletri, we had a big show there. - Let me out. - You ain't find anything here. - Please, let me out. - Okay. You want a lift, Lieutenant? Watkin, PFC Robert J.. Rayder, Corporal Benjamin D.. Andrews, Sergeant Samuel R.. Haskins, PFC Stephen D.. You didn't find him, did you Lieutenant? Well, I told you, if he's here, he'd be on our list. - Did you try Fifth General Hospital? - I've tried them all. - Well, are you sure he's... - I know he's alive. I know he is. As long as there're no records, no one who can say, "I saw him dead, I saw him killed". So long I believe he's still alive. Well, it's hard to give up hope, I know. - Hey, Winnie, the Krauts've pulled out Rome. - Okay, funny man, get lost. No kidding, it's official. Came over outpost's radio. Everything's moving up to Rome. Rome. Where is the 36th division headquarters? Straight ahead, Lieutenant. You can see it for yourself we're just moving in. Our files are still back at Anzio. Few days before we get... I've looked everywhere, every headquarters. Why don't you try a G-2? Maybe they know something. We don't. Maybe. Thank you, Colonel. You were very patient. I've gotta find me some real trouble now. Real old-fashioned woman trouble. - I bet you missed these? - I sure did. - You're with the 36th division, aren't you? - Oh, yes. Do you know a Lieutenant Peterson? John Peterson? Sorry, I don't know nobody. I've been in prison camp... four months, maybe five, I don't remember. - Whom did you say? - A Lieutenant Peterson. Lieutenant John Peterson. Peterson? There was a Lieutenant Peterson in our camp. He was with me when I was liberated. - Where is he? Are you sure? - There's no guarantee he's the same chap, of course. My fellow should be on one of those trucks now. Good luck. Pete, darling. - Pete. - Huh? - Looking for someone? - Yes, someone. Pete! Elly! Elly, are you really with me? I've always been with you. Pete, I knew I'd find you. - Are you alright? - Most of me. My leg fell apart on me again. I guess I'm saddled with it. Your hair needs cutting. Is that change anything? How could anything change what we have? - Listen to the bells. - "La bella chiesa." It's for the victory. Don't let anyone kid you. It's because of you and me.
