THE CONFESSIONS OF AN ALTAR BOY Oh, those poor people! - Look, Pierre, this is war. All these poor people are from Alsace. They used to live near the border. The military authority forced them to leave their village to build strongholds against a possible German invasion. You understand? - Yes. - And what's the name of the river between France and Germany? - The Rhine? - Very good. And where is the source of the River Rhine? At the foot of Mont Saint-Gothard! You should know that by heart! - Yes, of course. Where are we going? - We can't tell you now. Later, when you grow up, you'll understand. You just need to know that this might be the last time we drive in this car. So take a good look at it. You understand? - Yes. Pierre, give me the camera. Are you ready? - Yes, yes. - Well then, come on. Stay in front. No, now you're hiding it. Let's see the car. Further to the right—More, more— More, more— Ready? Oh no, that's not possible. Smile! Right, let's try again. Attention! Oh damn! How does that happen! Ready? Smile— Smile! Come on! I've already told you I won't be called up. Listen to me. They're mobilising registration class 1916, and I'm 1913. You'll see, the war will be over before then. Thérèse. Thérèse, make an effort so I can take this photo, OK? So that we can at least have a memory of our car. And nothing says that we won't see it again one day. It's not as if we're losing it. We're just hiding it, that's all. So the officers won't see it and requisition it. All right? Let's go— I'm ready. - Attention! Don't move! Don't move! Thérèse, smile! OK? Smile. Mum, where's the car going? - Shhh. I've already told you it's a secret. We can't say anything, because the car has to stay safe for as long as the war lasts. - But I won't tell! - No, no, Pierre. It's a grown-up secret. BOYS' SCHOOL I looked on them with tenderness and pride They know why they fight They are fighting because the war was imposed on us by Germany Because, for 3 years their all-consuming ambition left Europe not a single day of security. They want to do away with the system of threats and constant warnings. They forced us three times in a single year to use— - Hello uncle. - Hello kid. So it's war? - Yes. But I'm disturbing you, you were eating. No no. You know, with all that's going on, we've lost our appetite. Something to drink? - I'd like that. You're registration class 1913, aren't you? - Yes - Well that's good. - You're in '11? - Yes, an "old timer", my dear brother-in-law. But what will happen with your school? - Two of my deputies have been called up. We'll split the pupils among the ones who are left. Thérèse will take the first grade Monsieurs Bourniquel, second and third grade. I'll take the fourth and fifth, as well as School Certificate. And what about you, in the Railways? - Just the same. But with people leaving for the army the workforce will decrease by a third. Which of course means extra work for the old ones It's always like that. Hardest for those who stay on. How are Julie and the kids? - They're doing well. Julie still complains of her auricular rheumatism. You know how she is. It's an idea she has. But, now I think about it— Isn't it this year your lad makes his first communion? - Yes? - He'll have to start learning his catechism. - Yes, and? I don't know, but with all your history with the priests— - Let's not mix apples and oranges, please! There's the clergy, and there's religion. Right. The clergy— As the head of a secular school, I will never agree with that. Never. This year those gentlemen tried to pull the same trick they pulled every year? Two months before the School Certificate. I mean that they tried to poach my best students for their private school. And then, they come bragging about these kids' success in the exams! Do you think that's Christian? You know, I'm not like Julie. There would be no communions or funerals, and I'd never go to mass. - Even so, We're still Catholics. Yes, we go to mass on Sunday. Not to high mass, of course, but the low mass at 7am. We stay at the back. You never know. If Pierre wants to get married in church, he has to take communion. - Oh I like communions. It's an opportunity to gather families togther for a party, isn't it? War or no war, we won't let go? - There's just one thing bothering me. The Inspector of Primary Schools. - Why? - Why? Because he's a big priest-eater. He can't bear them. If he finds out the kid is going to catechism I'm afraid he'll cause problems about my promotion.. - Well, you just don't have to tell him. - Exactly! We just don't tell him. Pierre. You're going to catechism this year. I've already told you what religion is. God, do you remember? He's the Great Watchmaker who makes the World go round. And without Him, there are many questions Science would leave unanswered. Do you know that? Right. And I want you to be the first to go to catechism. - I don't want to go! - And why, if you please? - Because it'll mean extra lessons. - Quite right! I want you to learn these lessons by heart. So that no-one can come along and say, and there least of all, That the son of the head of the public school is a dunce. You understand? - Yes. - Pierre? If ever the Inspector asks you questions you don't have to tell him you're going to catechism. Why? Because it's no concern of his. What's all this? What's going on? Well? So. While your fathers, brothers, uncles go off to the front to defend our homeland You lot are fooling around! Now, everybody stand up! We;re going to say an Our Father to ask forgiveness from God. Our Father who art in Heaven, Hallowed by Thy name. Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, on earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, But deliver us from evil. Amen. Sit down This year— is the year of your first Communion. A year of prayers. Prayers—For our soldiers. Prayers—For France. If you pray, God won't forsake you. Because God is good. Because he sent His Son to Earth to redeem our sins. The "Valiant Souls of the Holy Angels" tells the beautiful story of the coming of God's son to Earth Music! Hail Mary, full of Grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessèd art thou among women. Fear not, Mary, for you have found favour with God. You will conceive in your womb and bear a son. And you will name him Jesus. - God's will be done, I am the servant of the Lord. Oh Wow— - Yes, wow. The other girls are all idiots. But that one— The oxygen—is released—slowly—carefully. It goes through the pipe. Can you see there? And what does the oxygen do then? It's going under the water. You see? And then—Take a good look— What does oxygen do? It makes— little bubbles, you see? Then— It goes up into that little glass ball there, where it accumulates. And look, look— Watch how the water level is going down. Now I take this little piece of wood. What do I do with this little piece of wood? Well, I ignite it Like this. You see? Then, I put out the fire leaving only a tiny bit of glowing ember. Now watch carefully! I see that the properties of oxygen do not interest everyone There may be some who prefer to write out 100 times: "I dream in class during the science lesson" And what is the name of the condition suffered by those who dream in class? - Laziness! Gloria in excelsis Deo et in terra pax hominibus bonae voluntatis. * GIRLS' SCHOOL * Come on! Here they come! No no. Come on. - I can't see anything. - You'll just have to come and be an altar boy with me. We can see really well from there. - My father'd never let me. Come on! Take a deep breath. There's nothing like oxygen for anaemia. which is often the cause of pernicious daydreams in boys. Go on! One! Two! One! Two! Come on! Are you tired? - It'll be OK We're going to Mme Gromaire's? - Oh no! - Why? - We go there every Sunday. - So what? Mme Gromaire is nice. She offers us tea. She gives you cupcakes. - Yes, but you always leave me by myself. - All right, we're not arguing. You're coming with us and that's it. Come on, let's go! You should be ashamed. Mme Gromaire is a saint. For 20 years she has devoted herself to caring for her poor husband. 20 years! - Is he mad? - Pierre! You shouldn't talk like that. Monsieur Gromaire is ill. He's a little strange, that's all. - Why don't we ever see him? - Because such illnesses are always treated in the back of the house. - Our neighbours are very nice too. Not a day goes by that they don't come with an old crate or a cardboard box They say to me: "Here, this is for your poor husband". And I give them to him, over there in the barn. Then he paints them green. It calms him down. Our house is full of all those things he painted green. And he gets so angry if I want to take some away. Sometimes I'm afraid he'll kill me. A man— who was so gentle— so good, when we first met— Seeing him like this now, so nasty when he runs out of green paint. I pray for him. In the part of the house where I have to keep him locked up, there isn't a centimetre he hasn't painted green. I made a vow to the Holy Mother. I'll go on a pilgrimage to Lourdes if She cures my poor Fernand Every day I remind Her. - If you want— we could go to the back, to see if— - Oh yes! A little air will do him good. - Yes! I hope that finally, one day, the good Lord will have mercy on me. And now I have rheumatism. - Can I come too? - No, you stay there. - No! - Yes, stay here. Mme Gromaire! - What's happening? - Look! - Look. - Oh, the shame! Come on Monsieur, we're going for a little walk - But I'm not finished! - Yes, well youcan finish outside. Come on. Come on come on! Come on, let's walk for an hour or two in the countryside. But I understand you very well, I assure you. Pierre. If you ever tell anyone— that our car— is hidden at Mme Gromaire's— Watch out! Did she look at you? - Yeah! - And? I moved my arm like that, and I touched her hand - And then? - She went like this with her fingers. Hey! My friend, I told you! Girls, like nothing better than an altar boy. No, that's simply not on! As if we didn't have enough trouble already! War, mobilization, requisitions— And now Monsieur wants to be an altar boy. There, now we really have seen everything! - The Inspector doesn't have to know. - No, no, it's too risky. And then there's always the risk of a denunciation. I can see the scandal now. My promotion blocked and all the rest! No, no, no and no! And you stop whining like that! - I want to do it! - Don't argue! That's enough now. Go to bed! Go ahead! Go on! The French clergy is definitely incorrigible. It's true! Give him your hand, he takes your whole arm! Oh Lord, make my father let me be an altar boy— If you make my father let me be an altar boy I'll make a vow that when I grow up I'll join the Minor Seminary No! Very well. I agree. My Lord, make my father let me be an altar boy— - Well—You can be an altar boy. But don't shout it from the rooftops. I'm warning you! Only for the low mass. Understand? - Yes Dad. Two volunteers for the low mass now? - Well, yes. - Gosh, we've seen it all now. Suck in your belly. Don't move! - It's too tight. - That's normal, you'll have to get used to it. Come on, put on your surplice, quick! Is it true you're the son of the head of the secular school? - Yes Monsieur. - That;s a surprise! Here, chicky, chicky... Here, chicky, chicky... Come here Come here Criminal! Go and get it for me. Now all we have to do is take care of it! Go and hide it in my confessional. The pigeon's going to die. - What a monster that sacristan is! He can't stand the new priest. He says because of him, it's always dirty everywhere Weird priest. Oh, he's not from here, he's a refugee from Alsace. Look! That's all he had when he arrived. Plus his cow that he left in the orphanage. All right, I'll put the pigeon there. That way the fox won't catch him. He'll be fine. All right, I'll shut it in. Every tiny little divine creature murdered is one more year in Purgatory for the murderer. We'll say a little prayer for it. O God, who hast substituted consolation for the labours of men, even for mute animals— In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen. That will protect it from hunters, poachers, all that scum. And from sacristans. Oh the poor souls. - What's the matter? - Can you hear? - Is it the wind? - No. Those are the souls in Purgatory. Moaning because they suffer through being separated from God. And they ask the living to help them with a few prayers to enter Paradise more quickly. We'll say a short one. Our father in heaven ... ... but deliver us from evil. Amen. It did them good! - Father? Why don't the souls in Purgatory take shelter in the churches? - Because they have a conscience loaded with sins. Venial sins of course. Because if they were mortal sins they would already be in hell. And entrance to churches is forbidden to souls who are not in a state of grace. Do you understand? - Yes - Well you know, if that's true, they're likely to have a long wait. In winter, nobody ever walks past this Calvary. Father, why don't they go South? It would be warmer. - Oh but it does happen. I saw some once. Often they fly with the swallows. We won't starve now! Take this. - Thanks - Here you are, Jean. How about thanking the Lord by singing a little song? Yeah. Do you know "Little foot, beware"? - No. - Yes, I know it. - Shall we? One—two— ♪ I want to hear The voice of the Saviour, ♪ ♪ And as soon as I wake I make haste every morning. ♪ ♪ Little foot, beware Where you're taking me! ♪ ♪ Jesus is watching me Wherever I am ♪ Father! - Yes? - Can the Lord see us right now? - Of course, he sees everything. - Is that the truth? - Of course it is, since I told you. ♪ I want to hear The voice of the Saviour, ♪ ♪ And as soon as I wake I make haste every morning. ♪ ♪ Little foot, beware Where you're taking me! ♪ ♪ Jesus is watching me Wherever I am ♪ ♪ I want to hear The voice of the Saviour, ♪ Ah, marvellous! That's what we call a healthy appetite - We shouldn't starve! - You see? We did very well to give him cod liver oil. So now gentlemen, we open the boxes. And we place them on the—on the desk, on the table. Do it. Then you put the boxes down—on the floor. That's very good. All done? Good! Silence. What's the name of the dangerous gas that a criminal enemy could throw at civilian populations? Hy—? Hy—? Hy—? Hyperite! It's written on the board! So when the gas alert siren sounds— What does the gas alert siren sound like? Pinardel, what does it sound like? Come in. What is it? - It's me, the priest. You know, the new vicar. - Yes, and—? - Could your boy come with me to serve extreme unction? - Yes. - Fine, fine. - Thank you. Come on. Don't forget to put on your cape. - Yes Dad. Monsieur Moretti? Do you want to confess? Give me the holy water sprinkler. In the name of the Father, the Son— In the name of the Father, the Son, and the H— - You'll have to wait a bit. - What is his illness? - It's not about illness, he's never liked religion. but if you wait a bit, he'll eventually get tired. Sit down. Our help is in the name of the Lord— Our help is in the name of the Lord Who made heaven and earth. - For you.

Monsieur Moretti, No need to get into such a state. Do you hear me? All right, what he wants is music. In Paradise you will get some music More beautiful than mine sung by angels with trumpets OK? What do you think of that? And then around noon, or half past when the others are taking a nap you can go to our Lord and have a little chat with Him. Right? What could be better? If it were me I wouldn't stay here another minute. Look, you're not comfortable It's not even a bedroom That's not even a bed While up there, and I give you my word you will have a real bed And not an iron bed! A waxed wooden bed! However, to enter Paradise You have to be entitled. That's normal, it's the same everywhere. And to be entitled you have to be in a state of grace Oh yes! So. Shall we proceed to confession now?

Pierre! Pierre! Come here. Now, drink it up while it's hot. Good. Don't take the cover off. My Lord, remove from me the temptation of the Devil. Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. I confess to Lord God Almighty, creator of heaven and earth and in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, and was born of the Virgin Mary, who suffered under Pontius Pilate, but the third day rose from the dead. Father I accuse myself of having had impure thoughts. Father! Hey, I'm not finished. - Listen, what? - My confession. - Oh yes, go ahead! I confess to Lord Almighty, creator of heaven— - What sins did you commit? - I had impure thoughts. - Is that all? - Yes Monsieur. - Then ask your mother, every night, to make you a bowl of verbena tea with poppy and sugar. Got that? - Yes Monsieur. - All right, off you go! I must announce to the French people a serious event France can no longer count on the support of the Belgian army Since 4am, the French army and the British army fight alone in the North, against the enemy - That Hitler should be put in jail. - He's definitely insane. - The maniac has no respect for anything. He's laying waste to Europe. He's crushing the civilian population. And now he's coming for us. - In a month, it would have been the boy's communion - So? - Well we can't do it. - But what are you saying? Do you think General Gamelin will let this bunch of savages invade France? And all these registration classes we mobilized. Our factories running at full capacity for the war. Did you see last July 14, the military parade at the Champ de Mars in Lunéville? The magnificent outfits of the infantry? And the cavalry desperate just to get at them? And those tanks, made in Le Creusot! Mechanical marvels that go everywhere, almost invulnerable! Did you see them? - Do you think we'll stop them? - Oh yes! The German is disciplined, aggressive, that's true! But he has no sense of the overall strategy. - No no! Believe me, you'll make your communion. Calmly. Properly! And Hitler won't stop you. I therefore suggest "Asparagus from Domjevin". They're picked the day before, therefore very fresh. Vol-au-vents, which are homemade, of course. "Moselle pike with Riesling". We'll serve several depending on the size. And then a gigot of lamb, pre-salted. - Yes, that's not bad but—You see, what worries me about the gigot is that maybe it wouldn't be fresh. Because it's a long way from Mont Saint-Michel to here. - Don't worry Headmaster, I can guarantee the sheep come here alive. - Yes, and what's the garnish? I propose small fresh green beans with flageolets. This is quite common. - That's good! Not again! Let me sum up. Asparagus Vol-au-vents Pike Gigot with garnish Cheese Vanilla-chocolate ice cream - Instead of the ice cream it might be better to have a communion cake? With a first communicant in celluloid on the top? What do you think of that? - Oh yes, yes! - Well if it's possible— - Nothing could be easier, dear Madam. - And I'll serve you a Sauternes? - Is that dry? Sweet? - It's a white Bordeaux wine, very sweet. - That sounds perfect. It's perfect! Slowly! I told you a contemplative face. Head tilted forward. There, that's it, off we go. Slowly. ♪ This is our Saviour ♪ Oh no! I'll never make it. Right, listen. We'll continue in the crypt. Come on, everyone go down to the cellar. Move ahead. Hurry up, Pierre. - Why are we setting the table already? - Because we're going to eat earlier. That way we'll be done sooner. You can go to bed early and tomorrow we'll get up earlier. - But the mass isn't until ten. - Come on, don't argue! It's getting worse. What's happening? - The owner of the Restaurant de Paris is running away. - What? Let's check this! But what does this mean? - The Germans are in Metz, Monsieur. - But where are you going? I don't know, we'll see. - But, Monsieur, it's not possible. We're having our first communion meal tomorrow at your restaurant! We're waiting for the whole family. - This is hardly the time to think about that! The Germans are going to shoot all the veterans. So 1st Communion or not, I'm getting out of here. - What about asking Brasserie Armand? - They're fully booked. I've already asked them. - And Marius Kaeffer in front of the station? - Don't you think, it's too late? For tomorrow morning? - Of course, yes. - So what can we do? - I've got it! - What? We have the Paris-Strasbourg express train. The army requisitioned the carriages this afternoon to transport troops. They left the dining car at the station. Come on! - Do you think this'll work? - Yes, very well. I know them! Well not all of them, but I know a lot of them. - What if they refuse? - Oh, that would surprise me. Yes, that would surprise me. - Is this it? - Yes. Hard day. Here's another spade. All right, sit down. Would you like a drink? - We don't want to bother you. - It's very nice of you. - Oh no, we don't even know where we'll be tomorrow with this war. Albert, bring us a Riesling from the reserve. You'll see, it's fantastic. Your request is very sensitive. A first Communion in a Company wagon. Permission should come from Head Office. In Paris. But it's Saturday night, and late— What with the war, you should wait for Monday. If we're still here. - But Monsieur, all your supplies will be lost by Monday. And our first communion is tomorrow. - I'm hoping there'll be a train tomorrow to take us back to Paris - Oh don't count on it. I belong to the Railway Company myself, and I'm well informed. the track's constantly cut off by bombardments, and they're only letting military wagons pass. - Is it true? - Just as I told you. Do you hear that Albert? Oh sod that, one night in the wagon's fine. But two or three and I'm walking back to Paris. - What do you think? - Oh I agree. - And you? - Of course! - If that's an issue, my brother-in-law and I can give you two rooms at least, for as long as it takes. - And for the meal, your price will be my price. And with tips over and above, of course. - Listen, Monsieur Leon, better that than wasting all the food. - Very well. - That's just great! Well done Auguste! I'm going to invite him over for coffee. That's the least we can do. What? What? - But the gentlemen in the dining car have already agreed. - I don't care! This is the SNCF and I'm in charge! And you won't be having your little party on the State tracks! It's forbidden. Just reread the rules, old chap. - But where can we go? - That's your business. If you find an individual with tracks of his own to set your stuff up on, go ahead. But I repeat: nothing of the kind here! That's all we need! If that bloke is a spy, that wouldn't surprise me. What bullshit this war is. - In any case, it's still the fault of the English. If Chamberlain had said to Hitler in Munich "that's enough!" we wouldn't be here today Did you ask at Bageolet, the restaurant on the Meurthe? It's not luxury, but it's clean. - They're fully booked. They even have a wedding. - Imagine getting married in these times! - But you talk about Chamberlain. Daladier's no better. He was with them. Politicians! Shirkers, yes! - Now I think about it, there's old Mougeot. - Who is old Mougeot? - You know, Monsieur Mougeot works at the Forges de Lorraine Company. He drives the locomotive that pushes the wagons to the loading area. Well, those tracks? The State doesn't own them, since they're in the factory, And Monsieur Mougeot can't refuse me anything. His son passed his School Certificate last year. And it's thanks to me that he got it. There! What could have happened to him? Here, have some more dessert. - No thanks. - Yes! There you are! At least, you— - I'm back. All fixed. - But how? - It'll be a surprise! - No no! - Don't argue, today I'm washing you. - Oh damn! - Don't get bloodstains on your collar! - Of course not - Stand up straight! What idiot invented ties! - What's happening? What's happening? - This pisses me off. It just pisses me off! - Leave it, I'll do it. Here we are. keep your head up, little bunny. Someone's at the door! - Yes fine, so open the door. - But I can't, I'm not ready! - All right all right, I'm going. Here, do it yourself. Come in, come in! - Seeing you like that stirs me up inside. When I think that I knew you when you were a baby! Do you remember in Gerardmer when you peed everywhere? - Come on, instead of talking nonsense, give him our present. You'll see, it's a beautiful one, all in mother-of-pearl. - Well, say thank you to your aunt. - Thank you, Auntie. - Come on, open it! - It'll last for ages, it's robust. Oh, it's a beautiful! - A rosary. - Well! - Give your aunt a kiss. - Oh my dear! - She could eat him, couldn't she! - How beautiful are they at that age! We'd like them not to grow up. Well you see? It was nothing. - He has an empty stomach, poor boy, that's why. This is your gift. It's a missal. If you don't like it, I can change it. - You're joking, Louise? This missal is beautiful! - Say thank you to your aunt. - Thanks. - Thank you Aunt Louise! - Thank you Aunt Louise. - The poor darling! - Come on, give your Aunt Louise a kiss. - Oh my God, the bell's sounding the end of mass.

It's a surprise, come on! - Oh but where are you taking us? - It's a little shortcut. Come on children. - Go ahead. And here you are! Come on, come on! Come in, we won't eat you! Come in, come in, ladies and gentlemen! 1st class carriage. Congratulations Monsieur. - On behalf of the whole family, thank you! - Never seen anything like it. Truly magnificent! - Wonderful! Thank you! - Very good very good! - All my compliments - Is this the kitchen? - Yes it is. - Have you seen how small it is? - It's great - Oh how cute it is! Sorry, sorry ladies! No, please. Not in here, not in here. Step back please. Step back. - How many people can you cook for in such a small kitchen? - 60 people per service, that's 180 per journey. - Well, we complain our kitchens are too small. What would they say! - Another one the Germans won't get! - Those bastards! - Did you hear the communiqué last night? - It's a straw fire. I don't give them more than 2 weeks. Gamelin will counter-attack and take them from behind, Cut them off from their rear, and they're screwed. Surrounded. Finished! - Their generals are crazy, their recklessness will throw them away. - In your place, I'd be wary, gentlemen. We often have the opportunity to meet Germans On the Compagnie des Wagons-Lits lines. And say what you want, they are very correct people. I did the Orient-Express for 3 years, and never, never, on the German section did a customer ask to change the garnish of a dish. - Well, we're not here to talk nonsense. - Yes! - We're here to toast! - Exactly! To the communion! To the first communicant! - To your health, Pierre. - And to ours too! Good health to the Railway Company! Good health to the Railway Company! Good health to the Secular School! Good health to the Secular School! - What about the women then? Just because we work at home doesn't mean we have the right to nothing! - Cheers! - To the women! - Will you have a drink with us? - If you insist. - Good health to these gentlemen of the dining car! Cheers! And what about you, when is it? - It's next year. - What will you do afterwards? - I want to be a missionary in China. - A priest? - Yes! - Have you told your father? - No, not yet. - Well ... - And yours, what will you do with him later? - Well, we'll try to push him towards pharmacy. It's a good job with a lot of money - Excuse me, Monsieur, but what do you call that excellent sauce you served with the fish? - Sauce Cardinal, Madame. - Would it be too much to ask you for the recipe? - On the contrary Madam. - You serve it very hot, then that's all ... - Thank you—Thank you so much Monsieur. - What did he say? - I have no idea! - ... do you know what he found in the elephant's place? - No? - A flower pot. What about you, Monsieur? Do you have some jokes to tell us? It would make them so happy! - Oh yes! With all the journeys you've made, you must have a fund of good stories. Can the Maître d' tell us a story? - All right, fine, OK. So. The story of Marius who is seated on a café terrace drinking a pint of beer. Someone calls him to the phone, so he gets up. But, to prevent anyone drinking his beer, he places over it a piece of paper with the words: "I've spat in this" And when he comes back from the phone someone added: "Me too" - That's it? - Yes. The one who spit in another's glass is a boor. But it doesn't surprise me. Blokes from the South are all like that. I remember in 1915 we had several in my regiment. In the rear, they were always mouthing off. But at the front, there was no one left. It doesn't matter, we'll fix it. That's quite a jolt there. Hello ladies and gentlemen. - Ah, M Mougeot! Hello M Mougeot! - Hello. - May I introduce M Mougeot, Locomotive driver at the Forges de Lorraine. It's thanks to him we're here. M Mougeot was kind enough to use his locomotive to bring this beautiful wagon here. And I invited him to come and share dessert with us. - So who's going to pay for all these broken dishes? - I'll pay, Monsieur! Come closer M Mougeot. Here, give him a seat. Sit down M Mougeot. Ah, customers— - Weird customers. - I must ask you all— Be nice now, can I ask you to be quiet please? Silence! Silence! Monsieur Mougeot, the floor is yours. - I'm going to recite a little poem I wrote. I wrote it in 1920, for my wife. A daughter of the Binels. The Binels of Arracourt. To Lucienne. When the dawn of a new day streams through the shutters And, suddenly awakened, I see you, Lucienne I feel overwhelmed Hearing the light sound of your breath Comfortabily languid on the soft pillow You remind me of our first date In Monsieurs Vernouilhet's garden - Dad! - What? - Dad, can I go for a pee?

You know Monsieur Gromaire, he has to paint everything green. - Green, eh? - It's none of your business! - Oh well, I'm going home to Moselle. - Thérèse, I swear it doesn't matter. We'll restore it to pristine condition. You see, it's water-based paint. We just have to rub it with a tiny bit of alcohol. It's nothing at all. - It'll never be the same. - Yes it will, I promise! Don't get yourself in such a state. Come on, Thérèse - Yes? - We absolutely have to go now. Come on! - Yes. The basket! The basket! Oh, a green car! English subtitles by jeremys and Marseille TNT 2023
