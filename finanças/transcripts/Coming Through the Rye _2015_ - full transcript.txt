Nice shot. Go, go. Right here, right here. Give it to me. Pass it right here. One more, one more. Look at that header. Come on, put it up. Put it up. Right here, here, here. Nice, nice, nice. Let's go, go. Keep it up, keep it up. Asshole. Jamie, have a seat. Thank you, sir. What can I do for you? Well, sir, I came to ask you if you could co-sponsor my independent study project, along with Mr. Z. What do you plan to do in this independent study project? Write a stage adaptation of The Catcher in theRye, sir. I've actually already started it. You wanna adapt Catcher in the Rye? Yes, sir. Why? Well, because I think it deserves to be a play, I mean, it's the best book I've ever read. It made me laugh. It made me cry. It just... it really spoke to me. It spoke to you? Yes, sir. What did it say? Well, I mean, that's just sort of figure of speech, - but... MR. - Oh, I get you. Grabbed you by the collar and shook you to the core. More figures of speech. What did it say to you, Jamie? Sir, for the first time, I felt like I was reading about someone who understands me. Not Huck Finn, not Tom Sawyer, but Holden Caulfield. And we'll put it on here in school and I'm gonna play Holden. You have Salinger's permission? Well, I've been trying to contact Mr. Salinger, that... that's part of it, I've been writing to anyone who may have met him. I've read, he's a bit of a recluse, a hermit, nobody knows where he lives. I've heard that too, sir. But I can get in contact with him, I know I can. The reason I'm asking you is because you're the one who taught us the book and you're the best teacher at the school, practically. But if you don't want to, I'd understand. Like, hell I would. Sure I'm not one of his hockey players, or football players, or Fin, Feather, and Fur Club members, but it's not as if I'm asking to make a model of The Globe Theater out of Popsicle sticks. Which I happen to know, one of his football players did one year.

He wrote back and suggested Salinger's agent, the Harold Ober Agency. Here's my letter to them. No reply. So, I wrote Peter Fonda, you know, the boring one from Easy Rider?

Is there a part for me? Yeah, yeah, you could play, Phoebe. Oh, that would be amazing. Isn't she actually about 10 years old? Yeah, I mean, I didn't mean that you could pass for 10 years old. I just... I know, I'm kidding. I get that all the time. I meant that you could pass for someone playing 10 years... I know what you mean, Jamie. Don't worry about it. So, who's gonna play Holden, Ted? Got you. You'd be perfect as Holden. When it's gonna be put on? This winter. I'm trying to get Salinger's permission.

I fight every day from letting the machine get to me. In fact, the only thing that keeps me sane is The Catcher in the Rye. Actually, it's a play of The Catcher in the Rye that I adapted from your book, and the script is a life formula for Holden, Phoebe, and everyone else. Mr. Salinger... ...I know Holden as well as anyone except for maybe you. Part of me is Holden and I'm the guy who can bring him to life. I know this is a lot to ask from someone you or Hollywood has never heard of, but if I could come and see you and talk to you about this, maybe I could convince you of what I'm saying is true.

He taught me to rock climb and... anyway, I took this walk down to the lake one morning at dawn. Some mornings I just like getting up and watching the sunrise. Hank and I had started to drift apart.

Go right, then keep right all the way around the mountain until you get to the back side. And when the road turns to tar with pine trees on the right, his driveway will be up on the left. Oh, God, that is fantastic. Have you ever seen him? Well, I have. I've seen him, all right, but we didn't get too friendly. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you so much, ma'am. Thank you, guys. You've been a great help. You're welcome. Thanks a lot. Isn't it ironic that Holden is all into protecting kids and it's actually kids who were the only ones willing give up Salinger? People aren't always what you think they are. Yeah, well, you're nothing like I thought you were. What'd you think I was? Okay. I'll let you off that one. Tell me what I'm really like. Well, you're spunky. Spunky? Yeah. You're refreshing. Oh, God, I sound like a breakfast drink. You're bubbly. So, Fresca? You're honest and kind. You're strong. You're sensitive. Nice. You're nice. No, that was nice. Trustworthy, loyal, helpful. You're ruining it. I really do like you, Deedee. I still like you, too. Hey, this is looking Salinger-ish, isn't it? Look. This is exactly what she described. What do you think? Should we? Yeah. You think? It could be. Jesus, my knees are shaking. Look. Oh, my God, that's him. All right, let's go. I don't know what to say. Make it good. Yes. What is it? Sir, could you please tell me where I can find Jerome David Salinger? I am he. What do you want? Mr. Salinger, I've been looking for you for over a year. Why didn't you write? Harold Ober told me not to. Harold Ober has been dead for 10 years. I mean, the Harold Ober Agency, Allen, I think, the guy's name was. Yes, yes. Okay. Why didn't you listen to him? Sir, I can't really hear you from up there. Do you think he's coming down? I don't know. I really hope so. It's okay, you're doing great. Thanks. Here he comes. Hello, Mr. Salinger. I'm Jamie Schwartz. This is Deedee Gorlin. Well, what do you want? Why have you come? Well, sir, I've had a pretty rough time in school. And... when I read your book, The Catcher in the Rye, it just felt like for the first time, somebody understood me. It's as if someone wrote down the exact thoughts I had in my head. So, I adapted it into a play. That's a terrible idea. The Catcher in the Rye was created for the stage in people's minds. It mustn't be interpreted. It cannot be done successfully. Well, that's just it, sir. I didn't interpret The Catcher in the Rye. It's all your words. I even say on the front page of the script in a note to the director that it must not be an interpretation but a door through which the story flows freely. No, it's impossible. Anytime you put a boy on the stage with a trench coat and a red hat and call him Holden Caulfield, that is interpretation. Anytime you put a little girl on the stage in pajamas and call her Phoebe, that is interpretation. Acting is interpretation. Well, if you put on a play and somebody films the play, that film is not an interpretation. Then what's the point? Well, the point is to touch people the way I've been touched. To give people a chance to experience and to know Holden Caulfield, people who wouldn't have known him otherwise. You know Holden Caulfield? Yes, sir, I do. What did you expect me to say? I have been offered fortunes from people who wanna do this. Elia Kazan offered me a million dollars. What could you possibly offer me? Well, I guess I can't offer you anything except that this was done with a pure heart, not for financial gain. You know, this pains me. It just grieves me and it depresses me that someone your age should do this. Do you realize how often someone like you comes up my driveway? That wrote plays? No, they don't write plays. Where did you come from? Well, home is New Jersey but we just drove up from Crampton Prep, my boarding school in Pennsylvania. Didn't you know I would say no to you? - Didn't you realize? - No. No, I thought if you just read the script, I mean, it's your play. I never wrote a play. Okay, it's your book. That's what I meant. But the play has 99% your dialogue. Sir, I've had such a rough time in school. And The Catcher in the Rye just found me at the right time. I know, you have told me that. A bunch of kids broke into his room at 3:00 in the morning to beat him up. Is it possible he deserved it? Or maybe he took a risk and stood up for someone and tried to... Deedee, it's okay. Maybe I did deserve it. But, Mr. Salinger, that doesn't change anything. These are my children. They belong to me. They're mine. Now, I have to go. Mr. Salinger, look, I don't say this to be disrespectful and I say it with all sincerity. But don't you believe in the Bible where it says it's the role of the parent to raise the child into maturity and then let them go into the world? I mean, don't you believe The Catcher in the Rye has matured and then it's time to let it go into the world? No, that is a terrible analogy. The Catcher in the Rye never grows old. Phoebe and Holden are eternally the same young age. You look like a creative young man. Why don't you write an original play? Well, absolutely, I will. But I just... I feel like I had to do this first. Son, you can throw away everything I said, but it boils down to this. If you do that play, you're stealing. I'm telling you, do not do this play. Mr. Salinger, this play means everything to me. He's a perfect Holden, sir. No, he isn't. Please, sir. I'm sorry, I have to go. Mr. Salinger. Yes? Can we, at least, keep in contact? No. There's nothing to keep in contact about. Well, we met ♪.ID. Salinger. You shook his hand.

Do you know where he is? Yes, he's with me. Where are you? Where's Jamie? He's upstairs right now, he doesn't know I'm calling. Where are you? Somewhere in New England. I can't say but I'm trying to get him to go back to school or home, I really am. But he wants to go to Maine to see Gerry. Gerry? So, did you turn me in? What's wrong? Jamie, why didn't you tell me? Tell you what? That Gerry's dead? What do you mean? Your mom told me that he died in Vietnam. No, no, he's just missing, he's just missing. Missing? But... I can't believe that she said that. Jamie, it's okay. No, it isn't. If I just told my mom in the first place, then he'd still be at Newberry or he'd be at the Tate School. Jamie, no, it's not your fault. Then whose fault is it, whose? God damn it, why did she have to tell you... Why didn't you tell me? Because if I talk about him, he'll just fade away. No, Jamie, you have to talk about him. And talking about him makes him more real. Look, Holden talked about Allie, he talked about Allie a lot. Yeah. But not just to anybody. I mean, he was talking to the reader. Well, that's because he'd been, you know, talking to a doctor, right? And he was getting better. Is that part of why you wanna play him? Oh, great, first I'm queer, now, I'm crazy. I'm not saying you're crazy, I was talking about Holden and how he talked about Allie, maybe... because he was getting help. So I need help? No. You just need to start talking to people about Gerry. To me, at least. I don't know if I can. What are you thinking? That if I go home now, we'll never see each other again. Jamie, of course, we will. No, we won't. I have a car. Deedee, it's four hours away. And even if you did come to visit sometimes, it would be different. You can end up meeting some guy and I might end up meeting some girl.

If you don't mind the touch of hell every now and then just when everything is fine because even in heaven, they don't sing all the time. Yes, the world is the best place of all for a lot of such things as making the fun scene, making the love scene, making the sad scene, and singing low songs, and having inspirations. And walking around looking at everything and smelling flowers and goosing statues and even thinking and kissing people, and making babies, and wearing pants, and waving hats, and dancing, and going swimming in rivers on picnics, in the middle of the summer, and just generally, living it up, yes. But then right in the middle of it comes the smiling mortician. Sit down, Jamie. Son, you've given us plenty of grounds to expel you. Yes, sir. I don't know what to say. We know that some students have been giving you a hard time and your room was vandalized. I don't know anything about that, sir. You don't know you were being harassed? No, sir. Well, anyway, your room has been restored and certain students have been dealt with accordingly. Now, your mother called to tell me you've been hanging out with ♪.ID. Salinger? How does this come about? Well, I was trying to contact him with respect to my senior project but I wasn't having any luck. You just picked up and went to his house? Yes, sir. How the hell did you find him? Do you know what restitution is? A euphemism for punishment. Well, not exactly. But in this case, I think you're right. Jamie, at chapel tomorrow in the appropriate attire. I want you to tell the school how you came to find ♪.ID. Salinger and what transpired between you. With all due respect, sir, I think that's a horrible idea. I... I... I just think it's like going straight from the pot into the frying pan or, you know, however that expression works. I think people would be very interested to hear what you have to say. I want you to do this, Jamie. Hello. Mr. Dewitt asked me to tell you how I came to find and talk to ♪.ID. Salinger this weekend. Well, it started... It started with... All right. Try this. Why don't you pretend that it's someone you love? It started with my brother, Gerry. He died in Vietnam. It's not my place, sir. It's not. It's Salinger's. And he asked me not to. Jamie, it's your senior project. Nobody's making any money off of it. Or taking anything away from Salinger for that matter. The fact is, he won't even know about it. The project was to write and produce the play. If you wanna pass and graduate this spring, you have to complete the project. Think of it as a scholarly investigation into whether Salinger was correct that the play can't be done successfully. If you miss the mark, your fellow students will let you know. And if Jamie doesn't wanna play Holden Caulfield, we'll just give that role to Ted Tyler. So the play went on and it turned out to be pretty damn good. Maureen made a hell of a Sally Hayes but kissing her holds no attraction to me anymore. And boobs in general are no big deal either. And being Holden, Ted Tyler made a damn good Holden. It actually made me really happy. Having him play that role was, like, for the first time I really let myself go. Bravo. Bravo. Bravo. Bravo. Come in. Hey. - Hey. - That play was good, Schwartz. That play was great. Did you hear that audience? Yeah, I think everyone was just being nice. I think I'm getting, like, the sympathy vote. No. No way, man. I'm telling you it was boss. Everyone's saying it. It blew everyone away. - Really? - Yeah. And, I owe you an apology. I was wrong about you. How so? You got some pretty big balls. Thanks. And, you know, I just wanted you to know that I wasn't a part of that group that came to your room. But, I mean, I should've tried to stop them. You were a great Holden, Ted. You think? Yeah, I do. I really, really, really do. You know, Salinger, man, he got it all wrong. That play is the ticket. You think I should tell him? - No. - Well, I'm gonna. You're what? Yeah, I'm gonna give it to him like this. I took my name off it. You're crazy, man. Why would you take your name off of it? Because it's not my play. It's... I just sort of condensed the book and I... I wanna give it to him as a gift, no strings attached. And you think if it ever gets produced you'll play Holden? No. No. I'll definitely put you up for it. All right. All right. But I'll need your car. Hey, Deedee. You know when you asked me if I was jealous of Hank and the other guys, well, I think I was, just like you said. I mean, I don't think that's why I went to Leverett. I... I mean, I really was worried about him. And I was freaking out about my brother, but, I didn't wanna lose Hank, too. You loved him? Yeah. I mean, I couldn't kiss him or anything. I can't imagine something like that, but maybe I did love him. Is that weird? Personally, I think it's beautiful but boys get freaked out about stuff like that, don't they? Yeah. And in all boys schools there must be a lot of weird loving and a whole lot of freaking out going on. I don't know how you did it. ♪ And a light in the window ♪ ♪ To pass the night through ♪ ♪ Maybe so uncertain but what can I do ♪ ♪ Keeping it on ♪ ♪ Keeping it on ♪ ♪ And I know I like it ♪ ♪ But what does that prove? ♪ ♪ Sometimes I worry I don't know ♪ ♪ How to love you ♪ Are you scared? Yeah. Don't be. But I'll turn the car around in case we have to make a quick getaway. Jamie. Yeah. Your script. Oh. Thanks. Yes? What is this? Oh. Sadie. Sorry. Hey, never mind. Never mind. Sorry. I'm trying to get out of here. Mr. Salinger, sir, please don't be mad at me but we did your play. You're the kid who was here this fall. Yes, sir. Well, come in. Come in. Come in. Come on. Okay. Sorry. Here, sit. Look, first of all, it's Jamie, right? Yes, sir. Well, first off, I never wrote a play. I don't write plays. I write books. Second of all, how'd it go? Oh, man, Mr. Salinger, it... it was a huge success. People stood up and they cheered... Cheer and cried, yeah. You were there? No, I wasn't there. You're not the first person to have done this. There's a group in New York that did it. There's a group, up on the Hudson did it. The reaction is always the same, they stand up, they clap, they cheer and they cry. But you said it couldn't be done successfully? And the truth is, I don't care. I hate the theater. I hate film. I hate the critics. And it's just my way of thumbing my nose at them. They'll never get The Catcher in the Rye. Holden and Phoebe will stay just the way they are. Mr. Salinger, I took my name off the script and I just wanted - to give it to you in case... - No, I don't wanna see it. I don't wanna see it. Okay, but... I don't wanna see it. Okay. Okay. And don't leave it here. All right. I won't. Good. Now, I have to go pick up my son Matthew at the station. You need a ride? No, thanks. I've got a car down at the bottom of your driveway. Whatever happened to your friend, Deedee? Yeah, she's in the car. She wanted me to do this alone. I see. She's a nice girl. Yeah, she is. She really is. Thank you, Mr. Salinger. You're a very creative boy, Jamie. Go do something of your own. I will, sir, I promise. Yeah. How did it go? He was incredible. He asked about the play and everything, yeah. Really? Yeah. But he didn't want the script. He didn't want it anywhere near him. He says that The Catcher in the Rye will never be anything but a book. Jamie, I'm so sorry. No, it's okay, really. It's all right. Listen, Holden wanted a house near the woods but not in them so it could be sunny as hell all the time. He wanted to put kids in glass cases so they never change or grow old or anything. And he wanted people to write so he'd be done with stupid conversations with people like us. Remember the first thing Salinger said to us was, "Why didn't you write?" I can never be Holden.
