You sure this is the right thing to do? Hey, the boss says if we don't get rid of this stuff -- -- those eggheads down at city hall are going -- -- to shut us down. You do like havin' a job, don't ya? Well yeah, but why do we gotta dump it here? My dad used to take me fishin' on this lake -- -- when I was a kid! Spare me the sentimentality. Boss says we don't dump ii here we'll be forced -- -- to pay someone else -- -- to clean it up and store it. And that takes money. This just don't feel right. Would you shut up and do your job? No one's payin' you to care. Besides, it ain't like this stuff is dangerous. Ya, how do you know? People been dumpin' all kinds of stuff -- -- in this lake for years. What makes you think this sludge -- -- is gonna make any difference? Hey, am I gonna have to do this all by myself? How do you know this stuff ain't dangerous? I don't, and I don't care! All I know is if the plant has to pay to have it -- -- taken care of, you and me is out a job! I got five mouths to feed and you got three. Now get to work! You're right! What do I care, right? That's right. > laughing > laughing > more laughing > still laughing > laughing some more > Yep, still laughing Ah, Professor. You sure know how to tell a joke. Well I may be a man of science, Ms. Yates -- -- but I'm no square. Besides -- -- some would say the ability to tell a joke well... ...is a science! > More obnoxious laughing Another good one, Professor Jackson. Thank you, Ms. Yates. This is a fine spot you've selected. The perfect place for our experiments. I'm so looking forward to -- -- some real experimentation -- -- this weekend, Professor! So am I, Ms. Yates. So am I. And I can honestly say that, uh... ...there's no one else I'd rather be -- -- experimenting with. You flatter me Ms. Yates For I am but a lowly man of science. And you're professor to boot. Let us not forget why we are here. Your post graduate work and my future use -- -- as a scientist depend greatly on how well -- -- this weekend's experimentation shapes up. We should unpack. It's getting to be quite late. I'll grab the gear in the back seat, -- -- and you can get it from the rear. Sounds good to me! Let's be careful now. There's a lot of sensitive equipment back there. There sure is! > Chuckle We should setup camp a little further -- -- into the woods. The car should be fine, right here. Excellent idea, Professor. Would you look at that, George -- -- Elizabeth looks so sad sitting there all alone. You should ask her to dance! You actually want me to dance with another girl? Come on, George! She's my best friend. Besides, you know I'm not the jealous type. I know how to share. Do I have to? Your friend can be such a drip. How rude of you, George! Is that how they treat people on the east coast? Don't be silly, Penny. They're far worse out there. > laughing > sigh But seriously, Penny. I may be from the east coast but Mukwonago, Wisconsin is the place I love. Then why are you leaving me and moving to Texas? Don't start now, Penny. We only graduated yesterday! We have the entire summer to spend together. Besides, I haven't given up on -- -- convincing you to join me. What's so great about Texas, anyway? Don't you know? Li's the land of opportunity! I plan to find my fortune down there. And someday, when I've made a million dollars, I'm gonna buy myself a baseball team! Speaking of opportunity, the song just ended. Now's your chance! Chance for what? To ask Elizabeth to dance! If I must. Excuse me, Ms. Weir. Would you like to dance? Uh... I don't know if I should. I've never done ii and... ...my parents don't approve of rock and roll. Don't worry about that! Your parents aren't here! I don't know... Come on, it's easy. I'll show you. Come on, Elizabeth. You'll like it, I promise. Come on, Elizabeth! Don't be such a square! All the cool kids do it! Yeah, all the cool kids do it! Alright. I guess it can't hurt to try it. OK... now... look here. Li's easy jusi... feel the music. Now don't hurl yourself! Just... relax. Try to enjoy yourself. I'm trying! It just feels so unnatural to me! Like making out in the back of a Volkswagen! > laughing > Jonathan and Amy are still laughing > look at them laugh! > they are STILL laughing... and so is George! Hey, you guys! Leave her alone! What's wrong, Elizabeth? Nothing. I'm sorry, Penny. I guess I'm just not hip like you. Maybe I should go home. Nonsense! We all graduated yesterday -- -- and we're all going to celebrate! We've been planning this camping trip for months -- -- and you're not backing out now that we're here. I guess. Look, we don't have to dance anymore. I've got an idea. Why don't we tum off the music, cook some hot dogs, and tell scary stories! That's a wonderful idea, Penny. Yeah, my Johnny knows lots of great scary stories. Uh, I don't know guys. I don't like ghost stories. They give me nightmares. Don't be such a wet rag. Yeah, don't be such a fream. It'll be a blast, you'll see! I guess I'm just scared of everything, that's all. It's alright! Everyone's scared of something! Speak for yourself, sister! I ain't scared 0' nothing! Oh yeah? Well we'll see about that -- -- 'cuz I got a good one and -- -- it's ALL true. Gather 'round friends. I've got a story to tell. You guys ever hear of the hermit of Phantom Lake? I have. I haven't! Well, there's this guy -- -- who lives alone in these woods. His name is Michael Kaiser, -- -- but everyone calls him Lobo. My dad sewed with him in the war. He told me this story about how this Lobo guy -- -- took out an entire machine gun nest -- -- singlehandedly, with only his knife! Crept up behind them and slashed their throats -- -- while the dirty Krauts took a smoke break! That's awful! Not as awful as what happened when he got home. Seems when he got home, he couldn't -- -- adjust to normal life again. Kept havin' these weird dreams about the -- -- Germans breaking into his house -- -- and trying to kill his whole family. Sometimes his wile said he'd get up -- -- out of bed in a trance, grab his hunting rifle -- -- and walk right out of the house. They'd find him wandering aimlessly through town -- -- in the middle of the night -- -- and he could never remember how he got there! One night, he was so out of his mind, he was convinced that his own wife -- -- was an undercover Nazi operative -- -- who was trying to control his mind. He went to the kitchen, grabbed a knife and tried to STAB her! I don't like this story. Well, when he finally snapped out of it, he found his wife had left him -- -- and moved back to Minnesota -- -- to live with her parents. She refused to come home until Lobo got help but -- -- he blamed her. He was still convinced that she was a Nazi spy -- --who'd secretly taken his wife's place. So he drove all the way to Saint Paul to find her. And once he got there, took his gun and BANG! Shot her dead. That's terrible. Did he end up in jail? No! Like I said, he's living right here -- -- in these very woods. That doesn't make any sense. How can someone kill their wife -- -- and not be punished? He got off because the doctors -- -- said he wasn't in his right mind. Said he was suffering from 'Shell shock" -- -- and didn't realize what was happening. Well, when he did finally realize -- -- what he'd done, he cracked. They let him go, he came back home, -- -- sold everything he owned -- -- and now, he roams these very woods. There's a murderer -- -- living in the very woods we're camping in?! I want to go home! Don't be such a bore, Elizabeth. Li's just a story. There's no hermit of Phantom Lake. Right, Johnny? Oh, yes there is! I've seen the guy myself! He's got these crazy eyes -- -- and he constantly talks to himself. Keeps talking about the Germans. I don't like this. Not one bit. > Unintelligible mumbling ...Krauts... > unintelligible mumbling ...Germans... > unintelligible mumbling ...Krauts... > unintelligible mumbling ...Germans... > unintelligible mumbling > an engine starting Germans! Dagnabbit! What's the problem? Dropped my hat in the water! Come on, would ya!? Let's go before my wife starts wonderin'. I have to go in after ii! I wouldn't if I were you! Come on, would ya]? Dam it! Stupid German. Lost 'yer hat. That's what you get! Would you listen to that. What? The frogs. Li's almost as if... ...they're singing to us. How long have you played guitar, Professor? As long as I can remember, Ms. Yates. My mother used to say -- -- I could play "Camptown Races" -- -- before I could say my first word! That's something I'd like to see! Little Professor Jackson -- -- plinking away on his two-cent guitar! Yes, it was quite a site, I'm sure! So tell me, Daniel... what were you like as a child? We're on a first name basis now, Ms. Yates? Oh... I'm so sorry Professor Jackson... ...I didn't mean anything by it. Don't worry Ms. Yates. I'm not offended. You can call me Daniel if you'd like. We are going to be spending -- -- quite a bit of time together this weekend. Thank you, but... if it's all the same to you, -- -- I'll stick to Professor Jackson. That's perfectly acceptable, Ms. Yates. Although someday I hope -- -- you'll feel comfortable enough to call me -- -- by my first name... Stephanie. Perhaps someday. Perhaps... ...someday. You should play a song! A song? Oh, I don't know. I really only play for fun -- -- I'm not much for performance. Oh, please Professor! I'd love to hear you play for real! Why not? What would you like to hear? Any old thing will do. An old standard perhaps? "Campitwn Races"? How about something a little more... modern. Do you know any rock and roll? Do you like rock and roll? Quite embarrassed to admit this but -- -- I am rather fond of the rock and roll. You are?! I LOVE rock and roll music! Wow, Professor! We have so much in common. Yes! Yes, we both like rock and roll -- -- and we have an unquenchable thirst -- -- for scientific knowledge. And we're both young and single! I don't know if I'd consider thirty-one -- -- to be all that young but... ...sadly, I am single. I guess you could say I'm married to my work. Well thirty-one isn't THAT old! I'm almost twenty-five. My father is six years older than my mother, It's not that far-fetched. What's not far-fetched? Are we getting married now, Ms. Yates? Well, I... um... No, that's not what I meant, exactly... er... um... I'm only fooling with you, Ms. Yates. You do like to fool around, don't you? I would... love to fool around. How about that song? Yes, please! I've got just the one! It's an original! You write songs, too? Is there anything you can't do? Don't judge me the next Elvis Presley just yet. You haven't heard my song! What's ii called? Ifs called -- -- "A-Rockin', A-Rollin' -- -- All The Way A-Ramblin"'... ...and ii goes something like this. Life is a mystery, That much is plain to see, Oh yeah! Oh yeah! I've got a tale to tell, I hope I tell it well, Oh yeah! Oh yeah! A-Rockin', A-Rollin', All the way A-Ramblin', Oh yeah! You see the world like me, So scientifically, Oh yeah! Oh yeah! A-Rockin', A-Rollin', All the way A-Ramblin', Oh yeah! > whistle solo A-Rockin', A-Rollin', All the way A-Ramblin', A-Rockin', A-Rollin', All the way A-Ramblin', Oh yeah! Magnificent, Professor! That was simply wonderful! Thank you. I'm glad YOU liked it. Oh, I did! I truly did! Elvis Presley better watch out for his career -- -- it might be in jeopardy! You're too kind, Ms. Yates. Too kind. Perhaps we should turn in for the evening. It's getting to be quite late -- -- and there is much science -- -- to be done in the morning. Perhaps you're right, Professor. Good night, Ms. Yates. Good night... ...Professor Jackson. Take a look at this, Professor. That's rather interesting. Li looks like algae of some kind -- -- but I've never seen anything like it. It seems to be confined to that one spot over there. Hmm... Run it through the Evolutoscopic Spectronolizer -- -- and see what comes up. Now be careful with that -- -- Evolutoscopic Spectronolizer. I don't think the University was very happy -- -- we removed it from the lab. As far as I know, it cost them over -- -- one hundred dollars. Well, gee whiz Professor! I can't even imagine that much money! > Chuckle Yes, one hundred dollars -- -- does seem like a lot of money -- -- but someday, Ms. Yates, -- -- one hundred dollars won't even buy you -- -- a ticket to the drive-in. That's CRAZY, Professor! I wouldn't worry too much about it, Ms. Yates. By the time the drive-in costs you -- -- one hundred dollars -- -- the drive-in will most likely be... the fly-in! > laughing! And you'll eat your popcorn by swallowing a pill! I wouldn't be surprised! > chortle > gasp! Ms. Yates! Come take a look at this! What is ii, Professor? I've never seen anything like ii! I've never seen anything like it, either. What is it?! I can't be sure but... I think it's a frog. But I've never seen one with these peculiar features. It has eight legs. Like a spider. Look at that thing swim! I've never seen a frog move that fast! Hmm... What is ii, Professor? I'm not sure, Ms. Yates -- -- but I think we might be looking at the next step -- -- in the evolution of the common amphibian. Do you really think so?! That's incredible! Or... Or what, Professor? Something far more... ...insidious. What do you mean? I don't know, Ms. Yates. I don't... know. Hello 'der! Oh, hello officers! I didn't notice you coming up the shoreline. Well, ya know -- That's the real benefit of chasin' -- -- down criminals in a canoe! No one hears you cumin'! No, I don't suppose they do! It does the trick with the ladies, too! Come now, Sven, there's a young lady present! Uh, sorry 'bout 'dat miss -- -- I meant no offense. None taken, sirs. What can I do for you? Actually, I was going to ask you the same thing. What do you mean? Ya see, my partner and I -- -- came outta 'da reeds over 'der -- -- and saw you and 'yer lady here. At first we didn't 'tink nuttin' of it -- -- until we saw all 'dat weird equipment -- -- piled up over 'der on 'dat blanket. Ah yes, that. I suppose to the "untrained eye" -- -- it would seem a little strange. It's just a little harmless science. Let me introduce myself. I'm Professor Jackson -- -- and this is my graduate student, Stephanie Yates. We're from the University, -- -- spending the weekend at the lake -- Studying the local amphibious population. The local what? Amphibious population. Frogs. Frogs? What 'fer? Believe ii or not, -- -- you can learn a lot about the world we live in -- -- by studying the local aquatic -- -- and amphibious creatures. In fact, -- -- some believe that through better understanding -- -- of the little critters of nature, -- -- we can better understand humanity's future. But the little critters of nature are so ugly! That may be true, -- -- but they don't know that they're ugly. Ya don't say. I had an uncle who used to think -- -- eatin' frogs made you psychic. I'm sorry we bothered you folks. No problem. If you need anything, you let us know. Thank you, officers. We need to catch another one of those -- -- "spider frogs". Alive, if possible. Professor... I think you should take a look at this. What is it, Ms. Yates? Well, the results of the analysis of that -- -- strange algae like sludge are back but... I'm confused. The Spectronolizer doesn't make any sense and -- -- the Hydrosysmometer is coming back... ...rather screwy. "Screwy"? Take a look. Well that IS peculiar. There's something not right here, Ms. Yates. I've got a bad feeling about this. I wouldn't worry your pretty little head, Ms. Yates. I'm sure it's nothing. My--. pretty head? Just an expression, Ms. Yates. Just an expression! We need to get these samples -- -- back to the campsite -- -- where we can study them in more detail... ...without interruption! ...without interruption! We should wake up the boys -- -- if we're going to get to that hike. I didn't sleep a single minute -- -- last night after that horrible story. I don't think I'm up for a hike! You'll be fine! You don't really need sleep. My grandfather used to tell me -- -- how he lived on three hours of sleep a night. But I'm not an old man! But you're acting like an old maid! Hey, you two! Mind your manners. What's all the commotion out here? Yeah, sounded like a cat fight! Ii was nothing, just Elizabeth complaining again. I'm sorry! I couldn't sleep last night. I was so afraid the hermit would come for me. You didn't have to come camping with us, you know. Who invited you, anyway? Stop it, you two! Elizabeth is my best friend. I invited her and this camping trip was my idea. Can't we all just get along? Hey, where's breakfast? Yeah, I'm starved. There's no way I'm going on a hike without breakfast. We already ate without you. WHAT?! Three women and none of you -- -- made the men breakfast?? I told you they'd be sore at us. Relax, Elizabeth. The boys can fend for themselves. They're the ones who overslept. Now come on, you two. We're ready to go on that hike, with or without you. Can't argue with that! I've got some trail mix you can munch on the way. Sounds swell! What are we waiting for, then? What a wonderful day to be -- -- in the great outdoors, eh, gang? Got that right! It seems a bit hot to me. I think it's perfect! Say, what is that? What is what? That gunk all over that tree near your feet. What gunk? That. What is that? Now that is way out. And it smells funny, too. What is ii? HEY! Don't touch it! Why, it ain't gonna hurt me. Guys... How do you know? How do you know ii will? Guys... Well, I don't but one thing I do know is -- -- you don't go pokin' your fingers around -- -- weird smelling gunk stuck to trees. GUYS! WHAT?! Look. Maybe we should keep moving. Maybe we should go back to the campsite. I'm with Elizabeth on this one, -- -- maybe we should head back. Yeah, let's go back. Are you kidding? Over a little animal print?! Come on, it's just a bear or something. That doesn't look like any bear print I've ever seen. Oh, so it's not a bear. Big deal, ii doesn't mean anything. Come on, you guys, let's keep going. Li's a gorgeous day! I'm scared. Well you're scared of everything! You said so yourself! Come on, let's just head back Jonathan. We don't want to upset the girls. Besides, I think we could all use some lunch. That trail mix just didn't cut it. Aww, shucks. Ok, let's go. Are we lost? No, we're not lost! We're just taking a different way back, that's all. Is that all? Wait... shhh... What is that? Sounds like... people talking. Oh no! What if it's that murderer Jonathan told us about?! Would you relax? That was just a story! That was NOT just a story! Every word of it is true, my dad swears by it! My father stormed the beach at Normandy! Would you be quiet?! Hello? Is someone out there? I said, "Hello"! Show yourselves! Now look what you did! What? Come on out and join us! We mean you no harm! Alright. Let's go. Well, hello there! It's good to meet face to face. For a moment I thought you might be spying on us! We're not German spies! German spies? Have you kids been eating the local mushrooms? Just some trail mix, sir. I see. So if you're not spies, what are you? We're just fellow campers, out for a hike. We're lost. We're not lost! Simply, taking a different way to get back. Ah, yes. I understand. Perhaps I should introduce myself. I'm Professor Jackson. This is my graduate student -- -- Stephanie Yates. We're from the University -- -- down here this weekend to do a little science! We're studying the local amphibious population. Li's nice to meet you, sir. I'm George. This is Jonathan. That's Elizabeth Weir -- -- Amy and Penny. We just graduated from high school on Friday -- -- and we're spending the weekend -- -- camping to celebrate. Wonderful! Congratulations! Perhaps I'll be seeing some of you -- -- up at the University next fall. I've already registered. Fantastic! Say, you look familiar. I... I do? What's your last name? Archer, sir. Archer... ...Archer... ...hmmmmm... Say, you wouldn't happen to be -- -- Henry Archer's son, would you? Yes -- -- yes, I am Yes, of course! That's incredible! I sewed with your father during the war! Really? It truly is a small world! Say, how is your father? He was an incredible engineer! He's doing swell! Hey, if you sewed with my dad you could probably -- -- settle something for us. OK... Did you serve with a guy named Michael Kaiser, -- -- the guy they called Lobo? Not this again! Yes, as a matter of fact I did. It's a crying shame what happened to him. He was a damn fine soldier and a damn fine man. He couldn't help what he did. I told you so! So the story is true? There really is a murderer living in these woods? I wanna go home! Now hold on there, miss. Michael is just a poor lost soul who couldn't deal -- -- with the aftermath of his wartime service. I've personally seen it happen multiple times. Michael does in fact live in these woods -- -- but he's harmless, believe me. He just wants to be left alone -- -- to make peace with his demons. He's not dangerous. But he killed his own wife! Yes, yes he did but he's paid the consequences. He's not a threat to anyone. Say, what is that you're working on? Oh, this? I'm analyzing a sample of this strange -- -- algae-like material we pulled from Phantom Lake. That looks exactly like the stuff -- -- we just found out in the woods. What now? You found this substance... elsewhere? Well, yeah! When we were out on our hike. We stopped for a rest down by the creek -- -- and found a whole bunch of that stuff-- -- stuck to the base of a tree. And we found a handprint made out of it. A... handprint? No, not really a handprint. More like a paw print... like a bear. So you found a bear track. Ii didn't look like any bear track I've ever seen. Well, what DID it look like? Honestly... ii looked more like a handprint but... ...it was really weird. How so? Well, it was really big and... ...ii had four fingers... ...and ii looked like it had claws. Really BIG claws! Now I'm intrigued. Do you think you could show me? Could you find it if you tried? Sure! Would you take me? No problem! I'm going too! Count me out. Me, too. Me, too. You guys go ahead. I'll stay here with the equipment. You girls are welcome to join me! Sounds great, we can have some lunch! Wonderful. Sounds like a plan. We'll be back as soon as possible. In the meantime, keep on that analysis. This is getting more interesting by the minute. Don't worry about us, Professor. There ii is. Interesting. This IS quite unusual. It sure doesn't look like a bear print but... ...it's not quite... human, either. I've never seen anything like it before. Neither have I. Neither... ...have... ...I. There's something not quite right -- -- with the lake today, Sven. What do ya mean, Gustav? I can't put my finger on it but -- -- she just don't feel like the old girl I've grown to love. I'm not followin' ya, Gustav. I dunno, maybe ifs nothin'. Maybe ifs nuitin'. > Sigh Lord knows this lake has been nothin' -- -- but good to us, Sven. Maybe someday when I'm no longer -- -- floatin' on God's green Earth -- -- I can return to this majestic body of water -- -- and have myself a good, -- -- old fashioned Viking funeral. Just like in the old country, eh, Sven? Ya... ...da ole' country. > SPLASH! Sven? Ah, doggone ii, Sven! Did you fall in again? Hey, now that's not funny, Sven! What happened to your arm? HEY, you're not Sven!!! > SPLASH! > SCREAM! What was that? I don't know, but we should investigate! Let's go! This is odd. Who's canoe is that? It belongs to policemen who patrol these woods. But where are the policemen? An interesting question. LOOK! I have a bad feeling about this. Something's not right here. They could just be on a break. They would have taken their canoe -- -- out of the water or at least tied it up. As it is now, ii could easily float away. Do you think they were attacked? BY What? That... thing! Now, let's not get ahead of ourselves! There's probably a completely -- -- rational explanation for all this. Should we go in and see if we can find 'em? Sure, I'm a great swimmer. NO, WAIT! We don't yet know enough about this -- -- situation to rush into anything. But they could be drowning as we speak! We don't know that. Besides, we don't know what that -- -- sticky black substance is. I don't want to put anyone at risk, just in case. We should return to the campsite -- -- and see if Stephanie's analysis -- -- has yielded anything. Lead the way, Mr. Archer. You got it, Professor! What have we here? Li seems you've led us to the wrong -- -- campsite, my young friend. I don't know why we keep letting you lead! All you do is take us in the wrong direction! Wait a minute. ...something's not right here. We should go. It's not polite to pillage around -- -- other people's campsites. Wait... ...look around. Looks like whoever camped here left in a big hurry. How can you tell that, Nancy Drew? Very funny. Look for yourself! There's stuff laying everywhere. Cans of open, uneaten food just crawling with ants. He's right! Look here... ...an open package of hot dogs -- -- with only one removed. Why would anybody waste -- -- perfectly good hot dogs like that? I don't know, but -- -- I think we may have stumbled onto something -- -- far more important than we first thought. Like what, Professor? Do you think something happened -- -- to whoever was camping here? I'm not quite sure WHAT I'm thinking but -- -- there's definitely something going on. First the canoe policemen -- -- and now whoever was camping here. Professor, look at this. What is ii, George? My Goo! What is ii, Professor? These tags belong to... ...MICHAEL KAISER! Michael Kaiser'?! Like "Lobo" Michael Kaiser? Like Michael Kaiser who killed his wife, -- -- MICHAEL KAISER!? The very one. So the story of Lobo is true? Yes, son. Completely true. Where could he be? I don't know. I don't... ...know. So, Stephanie, are you married? No, I'm afraid. No!? Aren't you and the Professor an item? I'm afraid not. But would you like to be? I'd say the silence speaks for itself. Is it that obvious? If I didn't know better I'd say -- -- you two were already married. Am I THAT bad? You're not the only one. I think Professor Jackson has a thing for you, as well. Oh, if only. It's just so... complicated. Why? Well... ...I'm his student and we... ...we work together. Puts us in a rather awkward position. Why are you going to University, anyway? You don't need it. Don't you want a family someday? Idol I do, but... ...I'm already twenty-four years old. I didn't know what else to do. I have five sisters and two brothers. Three of my sisters are already -- -- married with children and -- -- one of them is younger than I am! My oldest brother was killed in the war... and my other brother moved off to California to -- -- "find his fortune". My other two sisters are still in high school. I'm starting to worry that... I'm running out of time for a family. I'll just end up being one of thos old maids -- -- who has nothing better to do than stick her nose -- -- in everyone else's business. Not me. Jonathan and I are already talking -- -- about getting married. Really? You didn't tell me that! Ii was a secret but... I've been dying to tell you! That's really great, Amy. I'm happy for you two! Ya know... I've been thinking of moving -- -- down to Texas with George. I thought he was going alone! He was trying to convince me -- -- to come with him last night. Are you really going to go? I haven't made up my mind yet, but... after last night, I'm leaning that way. I'd hate it if you left. What about you, Elixabeth? Do you have a fella? Uh... ...no. Boys don't seem to be interested in girls like me. What do you mean, "girls like you"? You know... Nerdy girls. Smart girls. Nonsense! I've met plenty of men who love intelligent women. Well, I haven't met any! You should go to University! That's the place to find the kind of men -- -- that like women like you. Really? Absolutely! What about the Professor? Well, I don't really know the Professor. He seems nice. Aren't I a little young for him? > laughter! No! I wasn't talking about YOU dating the Professor! Besides... ...he's mine! Who is? Oh... ...Professor! I didn't hear you there! Don't worry, I didn't hear anything. Besides, I don't have much interest -- -- in what women talk about. You might if you knew what we were talking about. Have you finished your analysis of the substance? I... I have, Professor. And what did you find? As far as I can tell -- -- our initial estimations seem to be correct. Li IS some kind of algae -- -- but unlike any I've ever encountered. Ii seems to be... mutated. Mutated? HOW? I couldn't say, I honestly don't know but... ...that's not all. There seem to be traces of something... ...else. Something... else? Something almost... ...human. Human?! I don't understand! This makes no sense! I don't understand it either but... Ii appears to be some kind of algae... ...human... hybrid. That's impossible, are you sure? Did you double-check your results? I triple-checked! This can't be! I'd like to see your analysis, examine your methods! You MUST have made a mistake! She is only a woman, after all. Hey! Thai hurt! How can it? I am only a woman after all. Perhaps you kids should return to your campsite. We have much work to do -- -- and your presence is unnecessary. Go, have fun. Enjoy your weekend. What about these, Professor? What is that? Lobo's dog tags. Lobo? The forest dwelling murderer'?! He's gone, Elizabeth. We found his campsite and he's gone. Gone? Where'd he go? What are you so scared of? It's not like he's going to come after you. Not like you aren't the spitting image -- -- of his dead wife. L am? You sure are! Stop ii, you two! Yeah, leave her alone, would ya? Excuse me, but we really DO have work to do. He's right, we should head back. But Jonathan's NOT leading us. HEY! One thing... Yes, Ms. Yates? How much did you hear, exactly? Not that much... ...but enough. Enough? Don't worry about it, Stephanie. Let's get to work. Now THAT was a hike. How is it we were so far off course, eh, Jonathan? Can it, George. Boy am I hungry! I haven't eaten anything all day. Hey... How about a knuckle sandwich? Very funny. I brought some beef. What does everyone say to some hamburgers? Sounds delicious! Great! Start the fire, I'll get them ready! Good deal! See, Hold you nothing was gonna happen. The lake looks fine. I guess you're right! You're always right! That's right, and don't you forget it. Now all we gotta do is finish dumpin' -- -- this shipment and we're all done. You can go home to your wife and kids -- -- and pretend none of this ever happened. And from now on, maybe the boss -- -- will stay off our backs! Exactly! Huh! Would you look at that! What? You are one lucky stiff, ya know that? I hope my luck holds out until the next poker game. I'm gonna take all your money! Fat chance 0' that! > SPLASH! Hey! What's goin' on here? This ain't no time for swimmin'! You didn't even take your hat! > A twig snaps! Cut it out and get back to work! HEY! This ain't funny! What do you think you're doin'? What happened to your arm? You're not -- > YELLING! > splashing and DEA TH! Hey, Johnny... I have something I want to show you. What is ii? It's something I want to show you... ...in private. REALLY!? Wait! You ARE going to marry me, right? Wha? Promise me we're going to be married -- -- someday before I show you... what I want to show you. Because if we're not, -- -- then I don't want to ruin my reputation here. Oh, Amy, you know I love you! Of course we're gonna get married! In fact if... you show me what you want to show me... Your chances of becoming a married woman -- -- sooner rather than later greatly increase! Really!? Aww... you're so sweet! Let's go! Wait! Guys! What is ii, Elizabeth? What happened to Amy and Jonathan? I think I know. I wouldn't worry about it too much. Bu ...what about that man? He might still be out there! Come on, Elizabeth! Would you just lei ii go? But... but what about that thing? That left that handprint on that tree? What about that?! Can I smack some sense into her? Be nice, George! She's just scared! Don't worry about it, Elizabeth, they'll be fine. Besides, I'm sure it was just a bear print. But what about what the Professor said? He said it was some sort of algae - human hybrid. I don't feel safe here any longer. I REALLY want to go home! It's too late to pack up camp now! You'll just have to wait until morning. I don't like this... ...not one bit! > A twig snaps! Did you hear that? Hear what? That noise! I didn't hear anything. > ANOTHER twig snaps! Did you hear that? Yes, I heard that. George! > SCREAMING IN UNBRIDLED TERROR! > SCREAMING IN UNBRIDLED TERROR! > Penny and George are laughing > Penny and George continue to laugh > screams float softly on the wind -- -- all while Penny and George continue to laugh... ...blissfully unaware! Oh my god! Did you hear that? Hear what? A scream! I heard a scream! I'm sure it was nothing! How on earth can you say that? Do you have ANY idea what they're doing out there? For all we know they could be in trouble! Not yet... Not until her father finds out. This isn't funny! Something's wrong! How do you know? I just... feel it. Something's wrong. Maybe you should go check ii out. Aww, man! Do you have any idea what Jonathan's -- -- gonna do if I... ...interrupt? Well, what is Elizabeth's right? She has yet to be! Alright. No frogs! What happened to the frogs? I have a bad feeling about this. Relax, you two! Just... ...relax. George... I'm going! I'm going! Jonathan! Amy! Where are you? This isn't funny, guys -- -- the girls are really scared! > A twig snaps! > an owl hoots! (and echoes) > ...and echoes... > ...echoes... > ...echo... Seriously! Come on out! Oh... IT]... ...GOD! OK... this isn't funny. That's you, isn't it Jonathan? Right? Jonathan? Stop in Hey... ouch! What happened to your arm? You're not Jonathan!!! You're not Jonathan!!! > Scream! You heard that, right? I sure did, it sounded like George! Something terrible has happened! I just know it. Oh, STOP IT, Elizabeth! They're just playing a prank on us. I don't think so. That murderer is out there. Put a sock in it, Elizabeth! This is just another one of Jonathan's -- -- stupid jokes, that's all. How do you know? They're just trying to scare us. > Scream! Well, they're doing a good job! > Scream! That doesn't sound like a prank to me! > NOOOOOOOO!!! Prank or no prank, I'm leaving! Uh... where are you going?! To find that Professor, he'll know what to do! How are you going to find him in the dark? In the woods?! > SCREAM!!! I don't care! I can't take this! Elizabeth! Elizabeth, you're going to get yourself lost! Elizabeth! > A blood-curdling scream! > Sobbing > ...but wait... > ...could that be? > VOICES! Ii just doesn't make any sense! If the substance is part algae and... ...part human... it's just not natural, it can't be true! The equipment doesn't lie! Ii can't! I know! I'm a scientist, I know these things. I've been trained to accept these things but... ...but still... we should check them again! Again? We've already checked and re-checked them -- -- five times! I don't think another is going -- -- to make any difference. DAMN IT ALL TO HELL! Professor! Please excuse my language. I'm sorry you had to hear that. I'm a scientist and I know I should be held -- -- to a much higher standard than most. I apologize if I've offended you. No, it's just that... ...I've never heard you so... ...forceful! Forceful ? I don't think I've ever thought of myself as force Ms. Weir? What happened?! Uh... ---l--- ...I don't... ...I don't know. Are you alright? They're gone! What's gone? Ms. Weir, who is gone? All of them! They're gone! Your friends? Where did they go? They all DISAPPEARED! Alright now, calm down. What do you mean, "disappeared"? Into the woods... they were... ...screaming. Screaming? Who was screaming? Ms. Weir... who? Who was screaming? Jonathan... ...Amy... George! They were screaming! In the woods. This doesn't make any sense. Are you sure they're not just having a little -- -- fun at your expense? No! Why doesn't anyone believe me?! Alright now, calm down Ms. Weir. There's no reason to be hysterical. No! There is EVERY reason to be hysterical! There's a murderer living in these woods -- -- and my friends are gone! They were screaming! Screaming! Don't you understand? Something terrible has happened! We need to escape these woods! Get a hold of yourself! Nothing has happened! They were probably just pulling a prank on you. Teenagers can be cruel sometimes, I understand! I'm not so old! I remember what it was like to be eighteen -- -- with no responsibilities or cares in the world! Sometimes... ...sometimes people do things that may not -- -- seem very nice but I'm sure they didn't -- -- mean anything by it. In fact, -- -- I'd bet they're all feeling pretty bad -- -- about this right now. Why don't we get you cleaned up, -- -- and we'll all go back to your campsite. I'll have a little chat with them -- -- and everything will be fine, OK? Are you... ...are you sure? I'm positive. Now let's get you cleaned up. Stephanie? It's alright! I must seem pretty silly, huh? No! Not at all! I just get so worked up so easily. My brothers always said I was afraid of everything. I guess they're right. IT'S OK. So am I. You]? No! You're so confident and smart! So are you! You just haven't realized it yet! Someday you will. Well, I just hope ifs sooner rather than later. In due time... in due time. Well now, how are you feeling? Much better, thank you. I'm so sorry to have burdened you like this. I must look like a fool. Not at all! Do you think you're ready to go? I think so. Thank you for calming me down. No problem! Here. I'm sorry about this. What? What is ii? Ms. Weir... ...get away from that... that thing! Ms. Weir, are you alright?! Elizabeth... ...wake up, Elizabeth! THE MONSTER! Ii was a... ...monster! Yes, it's... it's gone now. Gone? Where did ii go? Li's OK, ii... it... ...it left... into the woods. Extraordinary. What is ii, Professor? Did you see that... that thing? Amazing! Amazing? That thing was horrible! No, no... don't you see? All of our readings, our... ...analyses were... were of that! But what WAS ii? I don't know! Something... ...something incredible! Incredible?! Surely you can't be serious! I'm ALWAYS serious. That thing was... WES... Was what, Ms. Yates? ...was a monster! Ii killed... ...George and Amy and Jonathan... ...and Penny! It's going to kill us all! Wait a minute. Wait... ...a... ...minute. What? What is ii, Professor? I think you and Ms. Weir are correct. How so? About what? That thing IS a monster, -- -- and not only in the physical sense but... I think this may be far worse than we first realized. What do you mean? That thing... that... ...monster. Li looked like it was composed of the same -- -- material we've been analyzing so we know -- -- ii isn't completely human but, there's more! It took Lobo's tags and it didn't hurt Ms. Weir. $0? So? So, that... ...monster, that... ...abomination is or was... Michael Kaiser! Lobo; How can we be so sure? Elizabeth IS the spitting image of Lobo's late wife. He couldn't hurt her -- -- not again! Within that warped mind of his -- -- lies the soul of a man. A good man. A good soldier! Bu ...he killed... ...my friends. We don't know that yet. Not for sure. They were screaming for their very lives. I heard them! Come! There is much work to be done! I don't see anything. I'm beginning to wonder if whatever we saw -- -- was some sod of... ...shared delusion. Delusion? But we ALL saw it! What about our samples? We both touched them, examined them! Surely, those are real! Perhaps there's something about the substance... ...something... ...hallucinogenic. But, Elizabeth saw ii and she had no contact -- -- with the substance. But she was the one that found that odd -- -- handprint on that tree. That was made out of the same substance. Perhaps you don't have to touch it. Perhaps being within close proximity is enough. In fact, -- -- that could be the answer to this whole riddle. How can that be? I KNOW what I saw! You know what you THINK you saw. That doesn't make ii any more real. But it took Lobo's dog tags. Can a hallucination do that? No. No ii can't. But still, even the Lutescotron shows nothing! Well... are you sure you're using that thing correctly? Yeah, I mean... it's not... ...well, I THINK so. But I'm sure there are no --- Professor! George! George, what happened?! That... thing... that monster! You saw ii, too? It attacked me. Ii killed Jonathan... ...and Amy! How do you know? I saw... I saw their bodies! Stripped to the bone! It was horrible! Calm yourself, George! I barely escaped. There was nothing left. Nothing but bones! Bones, I tell you! BONES! Get a hold of yourself, man! Ii was unbearable. Horrible! Where did you see them? Where?! In the forest... near the lake. Calm dawn, George. You may not have seen what you think you saw. What? This may all be some... ...horrible shared hallucination caused by -- -- the substance you're currently covered in. Why are you covered in ii? Where did this substance come from? Substance? Why am I dripping with goo? Focus, George! Where did this substance come from?! WHERE? The monster! It's made of this stuff! Oh, God, the monster! Ii killed Jonathan! Amy! George, there IS no monster! It's not real! Then how do you explain -- -- THIS! What is ii, Professor? A bone. A bone? A bone. A human distal phalange to be exact. Possibly from the pinky. Lu- !!!- !!!- !!!- !!!- !!!- What happened? He's... ...dead! WHAT?! NOOOO! What is ii, Professor? This was no hallucination. Professor? Stephanie... Whatever that THING is... ...ii must be stopped. What about Lobo? Whatever that thing is now -- There's NO trace of Michael Kaiser left! What are we going to do, Professor? I have a plan. And call me Daniel. Bring Elizabeth! We'll need her help. WHAT?! Come! There is much work to be done! We must hurry. The sun is beginning to rise. Ii all makes sense now. What does? All of if! Everything! Look here. This truck is loaded with these barrels but... they're em PW Look there. Right there is the very spot we found that -- -- strange substance. The very substance that... ...monster is made from. What's in the barrels? I!'- > GASP! Ii all makes perfect sense. Someone was dumping this Atomic Waste -- -- into the lake in this very spot. Somehow, Lobo must have fallen in. Perhaps he was trying to stop these people, -- -- who knows? The waste must have reacted with algae -- -- already present in the water, thus... ...mutating Lobo's very genetic structure -- -- creating a... ...hybrid, of sorts. Fascinating! Fascinating!? What are we going to DO about it? That's why we're here, at the lake. I'm not following you. Lobo is now half-human, half-algae, correct? Yes... Every time he's appeared he's never -- -- been that far from water, correct? Correct. What happens to water-borne algae -- -- when it's taken from its natural habitat? It dries out! Exactly! So, Lobo being half-algae, -- -- what would he need to do every so often -- -- as to not "dry out"? Something that if it WERE to happen he would be -- -- rendered helpless and possibly dead? He'd have to return to the water! But not just any water... He'd have to return here! Brilliant, Professor Jackson! What did I tell you? Call me Daniel. Oh, my! You have no idea how long I've wanted to do that. You have no idea how -- -- long I've wanted you to do that... ...Daniel. What's the plan? We have to prevent the monster from -- -- returning to the lake. H OW? We use Elizabeth. WHAT?! We know that deep down inside that creature is -- -- Michael Kaiser. He refused to hurt you because of your -- -- resemblance to his late wife. At least... it seems the most logical reason. We're going to use that to our advantage! When he begins to dry out, -- -- he will instinctually return here, -- -- but we'll be wailing for him! He WON'T hurl you. In his mind, it'd be akin to killing his wife -- -- all over again. For all we know, he may even THINK you're his wife. All you'll have to do is keep him from the lake -- -- and let nature do the rest. But... what if I can't? What if I panic? What is there to fear? He won't hurt you How do you know that? How CAN you know that? All my scientific instincts -- -- are telling me you'll be fine. -1- ...but... Listen to him, Elizabeth. He's a man of science, a good man. He wouldn't willingly put you -- -- or anyone in danger. If we don't do this, there's no telling -- -- how many people could die. You're our only hope! You're our only hope! Daniel, LOOK! Elizabeth, you must stop him! I... I can't! ELIZABETH! I CAN'T! Daniel, NO! Aaarrgghh... ...ugh! POW! (Oof!) BIFF! (Erg!) Ack! > THUD! No... Aaiiiieee! > THUMP! E-L-I-Z-A-B-E-T-H! > SCREAM!!! > YELL I HOWL! (more of a yell, though) > STILL SCREAMING! > STILL YELLING / HOWLING! It's WORKING! > Nice costume, right? > We're quite proud of it. > Although, it did require constant maintenance. > But that's another story. > Listen to the commentary to learn more! gurgle-ish, retching noise He doesn't want to die! IT MUST! > WHUMP! Listen... do you hear that? The frogs! They must sense it. The creature is dead. The human race is safe! And Michael Kaiser is finally... ...at peace. Thank you for watching our movie!
