[birds chirping] [heavy breathing] [GLASS CLINKING AND LIQUID POURING] POURING] [leaves rustling] [buzzing] You're an animal. But papa, I want to marry her. You will not. Her father was mad as a dog. [liquid pouring] The chateau wine not good enough for you, Jodeau. We can do better. Have you ever had better? A bottle of the reserve for our young friend. Let's see if it meets with his approval. [clanking] [cork popping] [liquid pouring] How does it taste? Common. Like a pretty girl in a vulgar dress. [laughter] I could learn. To gamble? To be your chief wine maker. [laughter] Fool. You slept. No, not a faint. You were properly asleep. You're drunk. My father refuses to let me marry. Why is that? Her father was mad. Barked like a dog. At the moon or at people he didn't like? What's her name? Celeste. Yours? Our grapes. We sell them to the chateau. Not bad. It could be better. How? It's a peasant's drink, and nothing more. The land's ours, but the chateau still controls it. We should be making our own wine. You should plant higher all along this ridge. We've tried. Nothing grows. Meet me back here in a year. Am I going to die? I hope not. I have something for you, and I want to know what happens with Celeste. But don't you know everything already? How could I know what hasn't happened yet? Write to her. Tell her how you feel. And on this night next year, maybe we'll toast your marriage. SOBRAN JODEAU: Dear Celeste, I write to you in the hope that you might know me better and that you will allow me to know you, because to know you-- every part of you-- is all I desire. [folk music playing] [pig squealing] [cow mooing] [non-english speech] CELESTE: A sorcerer charmed my father before he died-- gave him the dog's voice. [loud woofing] Like that. And the dog? CELESTE: Cursed, also. He never barked again. Was anybody else afflicted? How could they be? The sorcerer has gone now. [heavy breathing] [dog barking] So he finally speaks. You smell like snow. XAS: High altitudes. So? Are we celebrating? Twice. I married and she's pregnant. Well done. And I planted some vines. But look. It's possible, I tell you. What is this? Made by Italian monks. Grown on a ridge exactly like this. I can taste it. Heat, chalk. You're tasting the place-- what grows there, the animals there, the character of the wine maker. It's in the wine, but it starts with the soil. Try it. That's what they do. SOBRAN JODEAU: The monks-- they eat the dirt? They do. Every few paces. Try it. [spitting] Chalk. Now try over there. It's different here. Metal, copper. You need to balance it. Think about the taste you want, and add them to earth. But the soil is no good. XAS: You don't need rich soil. Not for grapes. Poor soil means minerals-- stone. Taste, flavor. But the plant will have to fight for it-- struggle to get what it needs. And it's that effort and yours that will show in the character of the wine. Try these. They're from my garden. They don't look like much, but they do seem to thrive in difficult places. How long will it take? To make a great wine? It might take a lifetime. I have a proposition for you-- a meeting. Here, one night a year, for the rest of your life. The rest of my life? Is that inconvenient? Is it bad luck to fail you? I'm not trying to sell you a sick pig, Sobran. If I bargain like a peasant, it's because I am one. Only because you think like one. That can change if you're willing. You want to make a great wine, not like the chateau's. A wine that's yours. A wine that's never been tasted. See. You have the desire and the land. Now you have the plants. And I have you. That's true. But I know nothing about plot, Sobran, and I'm not offering rewards or punishments. So don't promise, just come. [church bell ringing] JODEAU SENIOR: Sobran! [giggling] Monsieur. Monsieur, we're picking too soon. If you want to wait, go back to those miserable vines you put on the ridge. That should satisfy. Taste them. They're not ready. I've been advised it will storm. The sky is clear. Just taste them. The seeds are still bitter. Even one more day will make a difference. Or I could lose the whole crop. And what then? Leave my slope, then. I'll take the risk. COMTE DE VULLY: And Your father. What will he do for bread if you're wrong? Those vines will never take. I've known that ridge longer than you, my friend. I admire your spirit, but I won't ruin your father. Pick the Jodeau slope. [drums and fifes playing] [snoring] [heavy breathing] Don't leave. Now it rains. I could have waited a week-- two weeks. You couldn't be sure. No. I was sure. And I was right. I don't see what it matters. If you think like a peasant, you will stay one, Celeste. I want more for us. All we need is some money to make our start. Napoleon will give us a chance. Don't worry. I'll be back before this one's born. God's luck is on my side. [drums playing] Papa! [horse whinnying] [explosions] Please. Just let me drink. It's gone bad. Please. Help me. Help! Sabine, it's your father. [dog barking] [baby crying] Where is papa? Where were you? I was here, as we'd agreed. Why didn't you tell me not to go? Would that have made a difference? You're supposed to protect me. You spoke as if you knew what was best for me. Has what's happened not been for the best? My father died in these vines. Killed him-- tending this land and the chateau's. Celeste tried, but why didn't you help them? Your father would have died with you, as without you. Celeste accepted your wish to leave. She didn't expect my protection. Why would she? Why would you? Because you're an angel! If you don't protect me, then why are you here? Because I want to be. I wonder how it is. It all depends-- how it travels, how it's kept. This one waited two years. Could be bitter or could be worse. Time's done you a favor. Now, show me your best. I want to know everything about Sobran Jodeau. Anything you want to tell me. SOBRAN JODEAU: Her name is Nicolette. She's all my joy since the war. Try it. I can taste it-- the maker. Interesting man. Palestinian. Ferments his wine in clay jars. Well, not just that. Him. How he lives. XAS: How he thinks. How he cooks for his children. His life in the wine. And his risk. Would you have me protect you from that? Would you want that for her? To protect her from harm. From hurt. Of course I want that. Did my father feel that when I marched away? When he died not knowing whether I was dead or alive? [inaudible] Whatever he felt in it, you chose. It's in your hands, Sobran. The life she'll live, the wine you'll make. I won't miss another meeting. Good. And build a cellar. You're going to need one. Sobran. COMTE DE VULLY: Madame, I am here to speak with your husband. Well, perhaps when he is free. Could you ask him to come and see me? Oh, Jodeau. There you are. Are you ready to talk business? My grapes are not for sale. I'm making my own wine. Once you taste it, you won't doubt me again. Come the day, Jodeau, I'll gladly share a glass with you. I only hope I will live to see it. Madame. [water splashing] But we've no money. Not now, but soon, we will. We will. Our first vintage. I taste conception. A sin, with any luck. The first of many, I'm sure. It's good. Taste it. It's ours. The 1815. CELESTE: Sobran, no. SOBRAN JODEAU: Don't you want to be successful? Find clothes for that beautiful body? Hm? CELESTE: But what are we supposed to eat? We spent everything on the cellar. And the cellar will profit, I promise. Hey, Nicolette, what do you taste? AURORA DE VALDAY: Careful. Aurora. I missed you so much. My niece, Baroness Aurora de Valday. Sobran Jodeau. His father was one of my workers, although he is my competitor, it would seem. Taste it now, then again in six months. A gift for you, Baroness. COMTE DE VULLY: Bored already? I never should have let you study in Paris. It was a convent, uncle. Hardly a temple of higher learning. Not that it stopped you. Come, let's toast this new fashioned knowledge of yours. Tastes like dirt. You have to be patient with wine, Aurora. And with people. Is he an important man in [inaudible]?? Why? Have you taken a dislike to him? I'm sure I don't feel a need to go so far as forming a dislike. He's what passes for a man of substance around here. If you're going to inherit the estate, you'd do well to cultivate a relationship with Jodeau. If I'm to inherit the estate. My dear, am I mistaken? I thought you had no intention of marrying again. Dearest girl, I know you miss him, but a man is not all there is to love. Maybe you will be happy here. Have you heard from the marquis? You know I haven't. The Baroness, then? [baby crying] You're warm. I'm hungry. We've no bread, but maybe the children would like to eat dirt. Give them mine. Dear God. Sobran! Fetch the priest! [non-english speech] Papa. Is it because she saw the angel? No, Sabine. Angels protect. [difficult breathing] Nicolette. Nicolette. [panting] [screaming and crying] I want you to find her. Find her in heaven. I can't. Find her. Tell me next year how she is. You're asking too much. It won't make you happy. If you love me, you'll do it. Take off your petticoat and Sabine's. There will be frost tonight. We'll keep them warm, day and night. [cloth tearing] I won't lose these vines. [fire crackling] [coughing] COMTE DE VULLY: Ah, Jodeau. Still persisting with these useless plants? How much do you want for the 1815? The rest of what you've got on reserve. It's not for sale. I'll take a barrel. Six bottles. And you buy the glass. Six bottles. And this year's vintage, we'll take for the tavern. My niece will oversee the transaction. And now, you must both excuse me, for I have business with the Lord. A couple of heretics like yourselves should have much to discuss while the good people of [inaudible] are in church. Why do you bother? These plants need everything they can get. Even their own ash. So the dead are reborn. Very romantic. Oh, God. How thoughtless. Please forgive me. Monsieur Jodeau, I am truly sorry for the loss of your daughter. - She's with God. That amuses you, Baroness? No. I suppose I did not presume you to be a God fearing man. You don't believe in God? The vengeful God with the white beard and the punishment looming over our heads, and then the joy that will solve everything, including death? No, I don't believe in that. I choose to put my faith in the facts, although it would have me tried as a heretic in these parts. Much as it entertains you, Baroness, you'll find that people here believe because they need to. It's all they have. Excuse me. AURORA DE VALDAY: And you, Monsieur Jodeau. What is it you believe in? My experience. Well, experience is the one thing I do not have, monsieur. So I expect that makes us equal. Might I walk with you? Who are you thinking of? No one. Why am I not enough for you? You are. Then where do you go, and who do you go to? Allow me this one night, and I will give you the world-- you and the children. I promise. Nicolette's vintage. It tastes like sorrow. It does. But what else? You have the finest palate in the district. Regret. Guilt. Did you see her? She feels no pain, Sobran. Thank you. Thank you so much. No. Why? You think that we might be. But your pain's essential. SOBRAN JODEAU: Don't leave me! Listen. Life has pain, as well as pleasure. You need both. [difficult breathing] [snoring] [farting sound] AURORA DE VALDAY: You need a doctor, not a priest. No. I need what gives me comfort. He's highly regarded. Verifying miracles and diagnosing hysterical women. He responds to the needs of the people, as you will need to. Now is no time to quarrel with an old man. Employ Jodeau. He has his father's knowledge, and I swear, divine inspiration. Employ him. Just don't fall in love with him. [church bell ringing] [sobbing] AURORA DE VALDAY: Please excuse me. Please. He was a good man. AURORA DE VALDAY: I don't know which is worse-- having many loved ones to lose or just the one. MAN 1: Baroness, time is passing. Please forgive me. I must settle my affairs. Or rather, these gentleman must do it for me. Monsieur Jodeau, would you accompany me to the library? There's a matter I'd like to discuss with you. Yours, I believe. It was his favorite. [clinking] May I? Please. [clinking] [cork popping] [liquid pouring] To my uncle. Tell me what's good about it. It was my first and my best. Taste of promise. The promise of what? Better wine. Better than this one. Better than anything the chateau's produced. And you believe you could make such a wine. It's possible, but not certain. AURORA DE VALDAY: Why not? Baroness, making wine is not a rational business. The thought behind it, the time it takes, the way the sun moves. You can't force a wine any more than you can a child. You have seasons with their disasters. And then, all of a sudden, a miracle. A taste that's many things at once-- . was there joy that year? Loss? You can taste it in the wine. Do you propose to make your own wine, Baroness? No. I rather hoped you'd make it with me. If I'm going to keep the chateau, I'm going to need some help. I'd like to propose that you manage the estate, as well as your own. You may work here if you need to. SOBRAN JODEAU: Is this your uncle's wish? I'm going to try not to fail him completely. It's a bit musty, of course. And be careful here. One wouldn't want to fall. I hope this arrangement will suit us both, monsieur. A few more days. Then we press? Of course. Put a third of them back. The stems-- put them back. You risk ruining the wine. I'll take that risk. A third of the stems. AURORA DE VALDAY: This is unorthodox. Your methods are untested. Yes. My methods may fail. The slopes will be pressed separately. The wine reserve for two or more years in oak barrels, not vats. If it's good, we bottle it-- all of it, which will be expensive. It's a risk. - And if we fail? We fail. But if we succeed-- If we succeed-- We made the greatest wine France has ever produced. The chateau will take its place in history. I will agree to your conditions if you will agree to mine. I wish to be your partner. I want you to teach me everything you know. If you do so, then you will have my full support. Cassis. Citrus. SOBRAN JODEAU: No, no. Anyone can learn to taste fruit. Anyone. Think about the taste. You're an intelligent woman, Baroness-- maybe too intelligent. Deny your intellect and tell me what you taste. I don't know. Your eyes won't help you. But I don't-- I don't know how to explain it. Tell me what you feel. Tell me what you feel. Bones. Skin. What sort of skin? It's course and a bit smooth, also. Dirt. What else? Heat. Inflammation. A little pain. Effort. Sweat. Tenderness. Smoke. Chestnut. Cherries. Dirt and sweat. Sour and sweet, also. SOBRAN JODEAU: Tell me what you taste. It's the same. Sweat, smoke, and cherries. SOBRAN JODEAU: What else? Dirt. Desperation. You. It tastes like you. Yes. [splashing and laughter] [liquid pouring] AURORA DE VALDAY: To our next vintage, which I will introduce in Paris. Can't you just see their faces? Lady Negociante, a peasant vintner, and a wine inspired by-- An angel. The 1825. My latest wine for the chateau. [liquid pouring] XAS: Cinnamon, velvet, tobacco. It suits you. I'm a lucky man. When I met you, I was just a peasant. Now look at me. Look at my wife, my children, my vineyard, the chateau's. Those who used to patronize me now wait for my opinion. My decisions affect the whole region, and this year, I'll harvest the vines from an angel's garden. And I owe all my good luck to one thing-- to you. But I told you I know nothing about luck. My certainty, then. Of what? That there is no need to fear. The whole business of faith is pointless. Other men have faith. I have proof. I never gave you proof of anything. But you are an angel. You are proof. No, Sobran. But you saw Nicolette in heaven. You told me. I simply conveyed the thought that she felt no pain. Heaven, you imagine for yourself. Not all angels come from heaven, Sobran. Some make their home in hell. I have a small garden there. [sobbing] [birds chirping] SABINE: Mama! Come away, Sabine. He's been bewitched. I've allowed you your secrets too long. But when I find who it was who hurt you, I will make them pay. [non-english speech] [non-english speech] [knocking] [non-english speech] They tell me your father is ill. SABINE: You mustn't see him. The priest is with him now. I beg you, go. Please don't trouble us. Where did you get this? Who gave it to you? No one. There's no bird like this here. Give it to me. It's a gift. Stop it! A rich woman's gift. She's the baroness. She's a demon. She changed into a bird. Are the children inside? CELESTE: It's after midnight. I don't want them outside after sunset. Promise me. Leave it. [scraping] [knocking] Mademoiselle. SABINE: A gift for the baroness from mama to thank her for her concern. Do we pick? No, we wait. - But the storm. - The storm will pass. [rumbling] Gentlemen, I appreciate your waiting. You'll be pleased to hear it was a successful trip. Shall we taste? See what you have in store for Parisian society this year. Please. What happened? Your wine commands a good price, baroness. One bad year won't ruin you. One bad year? No. But how many more bad years are ahead? If this is how the wine tastes when no longer made with enthusiasm, then perhaps I should sell the estate. As you wish. Please. I insist that you join me. [liquid pouring] It's the 1815. Still your best wine. Please. So your first wine and your last. What happened to you between this wine and that? I was betrayed. And you took a dozen years to sicken of it? Poisoned friendships are a slow poison. I'm ready! On my death, you will inherit the estate. That's not important. So you say now, but life has a way of going on. My surviving an operation would be, in the surgeon's own words, a miracle. And I don't believe in those, so what would be the point? So you'll just give up? My living or dying will affect no one. Please go to Paris or ask the surgeon to travel here. Offer him a fortune. It's what anyone that loves you would wish you to do. That loves me? But I've never been in your confidence. Then let me make a bargain with you. If you bring the surgeon here and if you survive the operation, I'll tell you everything. [screaming] [church bell ringing] A miracle. Did you hope I'd die, so you wouldn't have to tell me? I prayed for you not to die. So you still underestimate my strength and overestimate your effect. So tell me. Not now. You'll need to see for yourself. And you will. [horse galloping] Ask your questions, but please don't say you disbelieve my answers. Why did you come? To torment me? To take my child? No, Sobran. Nicolette died. I couldn't prevent it. But I didn't cause it. Why can't you believe what you've learned about me yourself? Because I don't know what I'm looking at. What are you? An angel. Your angel. A demon. Your demon, then. I'm both. Sobran, you believe that heaven is good and hell is evil, and there is nothing in between. But I believe in both, and that's why I fell willingly-- because I want both. Why me? Your desire for life, for wine. My desire was a curse. But your curse was your luck. Don't you see that you can't have one without the other? That you don't get love without the possibility of loss, joy without despair, or a great vintage without many failures? You can taste it in the wine, Sobran. Why can't you accept it in yourself? And you can despise me this moment, but still love me. Still want me with you. So you give me pain. More pain than anyone. Is this friendship impossible? [horse galloping] MAN 2: Baroness, the carriage is ready. You mean to take my husband, but my daughter was enough. [screaming] Get out of my sight! Get out! Leave us in peace! [screaming] You're mine. [birds chirping] SABINE: Dear Lord, we thank you for this food and continue to protect us from evil-- the sorcerer, from the demon, from the enemy, from the snake and the rabid dog. Amen. [spitting] Monsieur, what do you taste? [spitting] [heavy breathing] AURORA DE VALDAY: I came as soon as I heard. I regret not sending word earlier. It's everywhere. And what do you propose we do? I have no answers for you, Baroness. So you've done nothing? There is nothing to be done. The stock is destroyed. My luck has run out. Your luck? You should have remained in Paris. The workers are all leaving. So tell them to stay. There is nothing for them here. They will starve. No, they'll work. I'll order rootstock. In the meantime, we will prepare. Each and every plant will need to be dug out and burnt. It should keep your workers busy. The chateau still has the means. It's futile. Aren't you tired of giving things up? Walking away when the circumstance no longer suits you. This land has been in my family for 300 years, and it's my birthright to protect it. Not all of us have angels, if that's what I saw. Most of us only have what is in front of us, and if God exists, he's in my own two hands. I don't believe in heaven. I don't believe in it. You know that. I want it now. I want it now, while you're here and we can do something. [crying] [fire crackling] The vines on the ridge-- they're the last. [fire crackling] [grunting and crying] Do you know what it's like to care for something your whole life? To love it like nothing else-- have it come to nothing. Yes. His name is Didier. He's the son of a nobleman and he's a connoisseur. His father procured the rootstock. He and Sabine have found much in common. He cares for her deeply. When I married Sabine's mother, there was talk of her trouble. I won't have Sabine disappointed or heartbroken. If you would speak to the young man's father. No. No, there's nothing to say. Sabine is a level headed young woman. She's had to be. It's a risk. Of course. One has to gamble to see what grows. Well, don't you think it's time for a wedding at the chateau? A wedding with no wine? I still have some in reserve. The 1815-- the year we met. I can't think of a better occasion. [cheering and music playing] [fire crackling] [coughing] AURORA DE VALDAY: May I join you? Forgive me, but the finest shoes in Paris are not made for such dancing. [heavy breathing] [sobbing] Salt. You can taste. You can taste. A little. Like an ordinary man. Would that be so bad? I used to think so, when I had an angel beside me. When I thought I was lucky. Call him back. Call him back. You're not yourself without him. XAS: Sobran. My beloved friend. I have nothing to offer you. I've made no wine for a long time. We'll harvest soon. A wine that's never been tasted. I have everything I need. The land, the plants, my family. But I want you with me. I want you with me to make this wine. Then help me. [digging sounds] Here's the clothes you asked for. So he's human now? And how does he like it? He said that it hurts more than he thought it would. Thank you. [buzzing] [coughing] [splashing liquid] [coughing] The wine. How is it? It's waiting for you. How do you feel? Shrunken. Old. That's something else. As if I'm getting lighter, but stronger. Is that what it's like? Celeste. Celeste. It's time. Take a [inaudible] [difficult breathing] [birds chirping] [liquid pouring] AURORA DE VALDAY: Sobran, your wine. [difficult breathing] What do you taste? XAS: I taste you. I taste Sobran Jodeau. [music playing]
