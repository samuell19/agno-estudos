Everything is ahead of schedule, the guys will be coming by soon to pick up their paychecks, and then you can take the rest of the day off, if you'd like. I don't think so. Why? I can wrap up all the paperwork. No it's not that, we need to start lining up contracts for the new year. We will. It doesn't have to happen today, we have time. Actually, we don't. What do you mean? Here, have a look. Okay, that's a lot of red. Our accountant's suggesting another business loan, but, we can't make the payments at this rate. We're covering the cost for three projects, lumber prices are going through the roof. Wow, I thought we had more wiggle room than this. About a month, maybe two, after that, What? We may have to file for bankruptcy. No, no. At least we made payroll first. Dad, stop. If we sell all the equipment, we can pay off maybe 60%. Dad, please don't go down this road yet, okay. I have a plan. That secret project you're working on with Quinn? Yes, I've got a meeting at City Hall this afternoon, so please just hold on a little longer, okay? Okay. - Oh, hi Scott - Hey. Hi. Hey, just grabbing my cheque. Yeah. Thanks. Blair, is everything okay? Yeah, absolutely. Good, good, 'cause it'd be a bad time of year, to tell my team they have to start looking for work. Yeah, definitely, all good. Okay, anyway, I'll see you later. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. There is no question audiences love Hollywood's hit show, "Design Dwellers." But what happened to season one hosts, and real life sweethearts, Blair Callahan and Mason Haines? As the show's ratings skyrocketed so did tensions on set, and the season two premiere just dropped, with a shocking twist. Interior designer and It Girl Casey Reed, in the kitchen with Mason, making renovation magic? That still leaves die hard fans with one big question. Where is celebrity contractor Blair Callahan now? Wow. Blair! Hey, you made it. Of course, I got a few blankets, and jackets, hats and gloves. Thank you so much. I thought I got enough, but it's been crazy busy this year. I mean, we're supposed to be an overflow shelter, but it's been jam packed every night. Well, we can scrounge up some more supplies if we have to, whatever it takes. And hopefully Mayor Hunt comes through for us today. Exactly. So, how you feeling about the pitch? Good, I was up all night going over the speech, there's only one thing left to do. Hey, sorry to interrupt, but are you the lady, from the home reno show? What is it? "Design Dwellers." That's the one. Blair, right? Yeah, that's me. My wife was obsessed with that show, when she got sick all we do is sit on the couch, and watch the reruns. I wasn't into it first, but you eventually won me over, you and that Mason guy I'd watch you two do anything. Well, thank you, I'm glad you've enjoyed it. Is he around here too? No, he still works on the show. Right, well, what a fun surprise I never thought I'd get to meet a celebrity, Especially here. Well, it was - it's nice to meet you. Oh, Kirk MacArthur, those are my kids, Jody and Finn. Anyway, I'll let you get back to it. Have a good one. You too. How many families do you have here this year? Too many. When the plant shut down, so many people lost their jobs, and their homes. They're struggling, like Kirk. Well, better get the show on the road then, wish me luck. - Good luck. - Thank you. You got this. All right, folks and that about wraps it up, for season two. Can you believe that? Nope, it went by so fast, but it was an honor to share, with all of you watching at home. We're wishing you and your families, the most wonderful holiday season. And a happy New Year until next time. Cut, excellent job. Thanks, Jared. Thanks. Unreal buddy. Everyone, I think that's the moment we've all, been waiting for, that is officially a wrap on season two, of "Design Dwellers," thank you. Thank you guys for all your hard work this past year, you've been coming to work an absolute blast. We love you so much. Thanks for everything guys. You two, absolutely incredible, you're lightning on camera, that's just the beginning. I feel like there's a lot of potential here. Yeah, I agree. Everyone, please get some Christmas goodies. Have a safe holiday, we'll see you back here, in the New Year for season three. Hey Mason. You get a chance to look at the contract yet? Yeah, I did, thanks for sending it. What do you need man? Do you want a bigger trailer? An assistant? I can get you a raise? Nah, I just need some time. Okay, how about this? We'll go out for dinner tomorrow night, we'll discuss it. Nobu, on me. Oh, I can't actually. You got a hot date I don't know about? I'm about to catch a flight to Great Oaks. Home for holidays? Yeah, that's the plan. You gonna see family, friends? Yeah for sure, but I gotta hit the road now, otherwise I might miss my flight. All right, well listen, we need this contract signed by New Year's. All right, so please touch base in a couple of days. Yeah, sounds good. Hey Mason. Hey. Did Jared corner you about your contract yet? Oh yeah, took me through the whole song and dance, for the third time. Same, but I was adamant no producer credit, no deal. Good for you. We'll see what they say. And what about you? What are you holding out for? Because if I can help somehow just let me know. It's power in numbers, as they say. You catch on quick. Learning from the best. Hey, I really wanted to thank you, for everything this past year. We've been through so much and you've been so supportive. You don't have to thank me, I'm just doing my job. Well regardless, I appreciate it. I think that we've got a really good thing going on here. Season three is only gonna get better. I guess we'll see. Yeah, I guess we will. Merry Christmas, Casey. Merry Christmas. Come on in. Blair, so nice to see you, please have a seat. Thank you so much for meeting with me, I really appreciate you taking the time. Absolutely, I meant it When I said I was committed, to helping our unsheltered community. Shall we jump right in? Let's do it. Welcome to Vista Village, a community of 75 tiny homes, on the banks of Great Oaks River, custom built to house our most vulnerable neighbors. Oh wow. Is this the old McAllister Plant? Yes, exactly, demolished a year ago, and just waiting reinvention. Each of the tiny homes are constructed to be fully functioning residences, 250 square feet, of living space complete with a bathroom, kitchenette, bedroom loft and electric heat. Interesting. We refer to them as transition homes, perfect way to get people off the streets into a safe, warm, private place until a more permanent spot opens up for them. And best of all, they can be constructed off site. So we don't have to wait for the weather to improve. We can get started right away. And Lord knows we have no time to waste. Exactly. And your company has experience with this kind of thing? We've been in the business for 30 years, if we don't have the answer, we know someone who does. Well, Blair consider me impressed, but I'm just not sure the city budget can handle a project like this. Oh, okay, well does that mean... We have to apply for state funding, and Mr. Adams, our Secretary of Housing, and Urban Development. He is, shall we say, not that affected, by the Christmas spirit. Oh, well, why don't we build a model home, use it as a pilot project, present it to the town, get the public on board? It really could put the pressure on Mr. Adams and the state to say yes, I like it. But again... You don't have the funding. Well, we have some extra materials at the shop, and I'm sure I can get help with labor too, with your go ahead we can have this done by Christmas. If you think you can pull this off, I'm all for it. I'll set up a press conference for tomorrow. Perfect, I will be there. Hello? Hey. Hey, okay, half cheese, half every topping on the menu, just the way you like it. Thank you. Okay, so I wanna say good job, but also how did you agree to float the cost of this tiny home by yourself? It seemed like the only solution in the moment. Where are you going to find 30 to 40 grand to build it? We're not, we have to cut the budget by 80%. And finish it in five days? We have to get creative. No kidding. Well, five days, no money, and your dad's company on the line. So, where do we start? Well, first we have to figure out what supplies we have. On it. We can cover the lumber, drywall, hardware. I have some leftover paint at the shelter, neutral off white? Yep, every little bit counts, we can also call in some favors with the electricians and plumbers. You know my ex from college? Tasha? She works at that kitchen and bath place on Fifth, I could try to swing a hefty discount. Yeah, that'd be great. All the windows and doors have to be custom and if we run into any roadblocks. We'll take it one day at a time, right? Right. But how many favors can we call in before it starts, to look tacky? Well, it depends on who you're asking, Quinn. All I'm saying is that Scott is a good person, to have in your corner. And I will call him if I need him. Good. Now, let's not let this get cold. Excuse me. Large coffee please. Mason, is that you? You look like you just stepped out of a car commercial. Hey Jim. Hey, what is this? Forget what these East Coast winners are like already? Nah, I can never forget this place. He'll have a large decaf, white chocolate mocha, extra whip. That right? That's right. Only contractor on the face of God's green earth, that doesn't drink real coffee. What can I say, it's a gift. No, on me this time. Huh, thanks. So how are you doing? What brings you back to Great Oaks? Your mom, she moved full time down to Florida, didn't she? Yeah, I'm actually meeting with a real estate agent, about selling my place. Huh. It's been sitting empty for the last couple of years, so I figured it was probably time. So I guess that means the show's going well though? Yeah, it's good. And how's Blair? You know what? Why don't you find out for yourself? Come on, she's just across the street. ♪ Oh jingle bells jingle bells ♪ ♪ Jingle all the way ♪ ♪ Oh what fun it is to ride in one horse-open sleigh ♪ ♪ Jingle bells jingle bells ♪ ♪ Jingle all the way ♪ ♪ Oh what fun it is to ride in one horse-open sleigh ♪ I'll start us off with the introduction, then you can jump in with the Tiny Home design plan. Sounds great. Oh wow, the place looks beautiful. Yes, our design team did an amazing job. This town could use some good news and a little hope, the camera will be here and we've got a teleprompter, in case you need it. Oh no I'm good, thanks though. Ah, yes, I sometimes almost forget you have experience, with this kind of thing. Anyway we have a few key folks in attendance but that's it. Hopefully gives us more one-on-one time, with Mr. Adams who apparently just pulled in. Anything I should know? Make no mistake, he knows his job is on the line, if the governor doesn't get reelected. He can't afford any hiccups. Mr. Adams, welcome. Mayor Hunt, good to see you again. Likewise, we appreciate you coming, I know how busy you are. Yes, but I'm always interested in hearing about creative solutions to the housing issue. On that note, I'd like to introduce you to the brains behind the operation, Blair Callahan. Nice to meet you Mr. Adams. Wait, do I know you from somewhere? Yes, you might. You and that guy, you were on that design show. Yeah, "Design Dwellers." That's right, Blair, huh? And Mason. Mason. Pleasure to meet you, sir. It's nice to meet you too. I mean, this is so great you two working on this together. You two make quite a pair. Oh wait that... Blair, what a brilliant idea. No, no no, no... This is such a nice surprise, Mayor Hunt. Nice to meet you. This is Percy Adams, our Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and you know Blair of course. Of course, hi Blair. We're so thrilled to have you on board. Yes, right on board what exactly? Just as charming in real life, right, Jim? Oh yeah. If you'll just excuse us for a moment, we have to have a quick word, thanks. What do you think you are doing here? Wait why? You can't just show up here unannounced. What just happened in there? What are you doing here? Entertaining a Mr. Adams, I guess. Man, how did this happen? Wh-what project were they talking about? We are building a tiny home community for the houseless. At least that's what we're trying to do if we can win that guy over. Oh wow, a whole community? Yeah. I didn't realize that we had that many folks in need in this town. Yeah, well you've missed a lot. Hey guys, this is so fun. About that... I gotta hand it to you Blair, Great Oak's, celebrity couple reuniting for a great cause at Christmas? The press is gonna be all over this. I mean, he's not actually back. Oh. For a long time, just till New Year's. Right, but the model homes shouldn't take too long to build, right? No it shouldn't. Okay then let's set the reveal date for the 23rd, we'll make it a fundraising event. Invite the town, Mr. Adams and the rest of the state officials. People will be so excited to meet you both and to see you work up close. Great. Okay, let me just go write that into my speech, I'll see you out there. Hey, so? Yep. I guess we're building a tiny home. Yep, I guess we are. Mic check, can everybody hear me? Hello everybody, and thank you so much for coming. As you know, it has been a priority of mine to address the growing crisis, facing our unsheltered community. That is why I am so excited to show you our vision for the future of our great city. Welcome to Vista Village, a community of 75 tiny homes all designed by our very own Callahan and Family Contracting. Thank you, Jim. I am so excited to show you our vision, for the purpose of our community. Hey, I didn't mean to step on your toes back there. Oh, come on, that was a classic Mason move. What's that supposed to mean? Always swooping in saving the day. There was no swooping, I got dragged into this. One minute I'm hiring a real estate agent to sell my place and next I'm shaking hands with the Mayor... You're selling your place? Yeah, I am. Well then it's a good thing, this will be quick. You want me to back out, I will. And here to tell us more about it, from our favorite home renovation show, "Design Dwellers" are Blair Callahan and Mason Haines. Just let me do the talking for once, okay? Good afternoon everyone. When the factory closed, people in our community lost their jobs and their homes. Callahan Construction has a solution, Tiny Homes. Hey dad. Hey honey. So what do you think? It's not at all what I expected. I mean that in the best possible way, this is a great idea, Blair. Really? Of course, it's just we only have a few days. I know, but we can do it. It's only 250 square feet. I agree. So, sorry about dragging Mason over last night, What's going on with you two? There is no me and Mason, that was an accidental thing. We're tolerating each other for publicity and that is all. And he has lot on his plate, I'd be surprised if he even shows. Well, sorry to disappoint. Morning. Want a coffee? Yeah, that'd be great, thanks Coming right up. So are those the plans? Nice work by the way, I like the sleeping loft with the built-in shelving in the living room. You've got that all in two seconds? Oh, I had Mayor Hunt send me your pitch, looked at it last night. I'll be out back if you need me. Great, thanks. So you can just show up for the reveal and leave the rest to me, you don't have to get your hands dirty. Oh, that's not fair. And besides what happens if the mayor shows up and I'm not here? Or the press sees me out in about? We don't want people to think we're not taking this seriously. Fine, stay. All right. Would you be open to a couple of suggestions? We don't really have time to tinker with the design. I get it, but it's just that it kind of looks like a shipping container. No it doesn't. It definitely does. No, it is purposeful and affordable. I know but, a little charm wouldn't hurt anybody. It would hurt our budget. What if we do something simple? Like change the roof line, just a bit to open up the loft. Add a bump out here to make a front porch to give it some dimension with an extra window and a decorative peak? We can add a couple lawn chairs and a fire pit for the winter, it would be a bit homier, don't you think? We both know that decorative is just code for more expensive. We're already working with donated materials and borrowed time as it is. Yeah, but don't you wanna wow them? Yes, of course. But we can't have Mr. Adams thinking we're being frivolous with public funds. It'll sink us. Or it'll get him excited about it. Here we go. What? I knew we couldn't go five minutes without us fighting. We're not fighting, we're planning. I already have a plan. We're not on a show anymore Mason, okay? We don't have rating targets to hit. It's not about that, I want this to work Blair. Well, I need this to work. Hey. Yeah, you better run. What are you doing? They must have followed you here. So, I don't care. What, you don't care, this is private property. People do it all the time. Well, photos of us fighting doesn't exactly scream, "Hometown Couple reunites for a good cause." It'll be okay. It's like that old Latin saying, enshrined down the Hollywood sign. What saying? "All press is good press." Wow, you really have gone all Hollywood. Hey, I'm just trying to help. Well, you missed that boat by about a year. Wow, hold on now. Look its fine, okay? We'll change the roof line and we'll put in your little porch and window. Blair... But if it derails us in any way... You'll what? Leave me again? Now that's not fair. You know what, you just stick to the schmoozing, I'll stick to the work, okay? And a two by three double pane fixed. Yeah, anytime tomorrow's great. Okay, thank you. Oh great, let's have a look. Yeah, a few options. I love the dark Walnut. Oh. You want me to grab Mason? No. I thought he was helping with some of the design details. I can choose the flooring dad. Yeah, I know, but just thought you'd rather be putting the base together. What, he's following the plans, right? Ah, I'm sure he is. Yeah. Look, just because he's helping drum up press, doesn't mean it's his project, you're still in the driver's seat. It's clearly not how the world is gonna see it. Doesn't matter what the world thinks, matters what you believe. Thanks Aristotle. Hey, consider it an early Christmas gift. Hey, it wouldn't so be so bad having him around, give you two a chance to hash it out. There's nothing left to hash out. If that were true, you'd be out there instead of in here. Dad. Just think about it. I'm gonna go order the steel roof. I'll see you later. Yeah, don't let the door hit you on the way out. Mason, looks like you've made quite a start with the project. Mayor Hunt, why don't we go inside? Oh dear. After you. Thank you. Yeah, so Blair and I agreed on a front porch and it is going to look amazing. No, that's wonderful, so glad to hear it. Mayor Hunt, hi. Blair, hi, I hope it's okay, I showed up unannounced like this? Of course, what brings you by? So my press secretary sent me some photos that just went online. You two aren't having any problems, are you? Oh no, no, no, no, of course not, those photos were taken completely out of context. Yeah. Right, well that's good because we wouldn't want a repeat of what happened on your show. Of course not. And there are real lives on the line here, so we need to present a strong united front to Mr. Adams. Absolutely, agreed. Good, so as far as next steps... We are finishing the base and foundation and we will head to Quin Shelter tomorrow to talk to some people and see what kind of features they might want to see. We are? I mean, yes we are. Well, that sounds like a wonderful idea. That's Blair for you, always keeping a pulse on what's really important. And Mason, such a perfectionist, doesn't know when to quit, especially when it comes to business. Classic Blair, honest to a fault. You two sure do know each other well. Oh yeah, we are like two peas in a pod. A friendship pod. Yep, thick as thieves we are. Well, I'm glad to hear it. Let's touch base soon though, okay. Okay. All right. Sounds good. Okay. Good to see you, thanks. Hey guys, we got a problem. What is it? So I ordered the roofing supplies and the trusses they're coming pre-fabricated as per your specs but... What? They close for the holidays tomorrow. They need to deliver first thing. But we can't put up a roof without walls, the reveal is three days away, we won't finish in time. Can we order it from somewhere else? We don't have the budget for that. I'll pay for it, it's fine. No, absolutely not. Why not? I'm the one who insisted on changing the designs, so I'll throw it on the extra cash, it's not a big deal. Dad, I'll call Scott, can you start on the other carpenters? Sure thing. Okay. Blair, hold on. But we have to put up the framing today. That's a two day job, what if we push it? But in a few hours, I don't think so. Well, we can stay in here arguing, or we can take out our phones, and see what favors we can call in. We need carpenters, lots of them. That's my real estate agent, I got- That's Blair for "welcome back". Hey, hey. Hey, what do you have there? Figured we could use a little fuel. Oh, thank you. You are welcome. Perfect. You brought your whole crew? You said you needed to get the walls up before tomorrow. Hey there. Hey. Mason Haines, nice to meet you. Yeah, I figured, I'm Scott. Scott. Yeah. Cool, thanks for coming. Of course, anything for Blair. Okay, let's get started, shall we? Excuse me please, thank you. Hi guys, thank you so much for coming on such short notice. I know it's the holidays, but we really appreciate it. And it's for a very good cause close to all our hearts. Okay, so we've got about six hours to build the entire frame of the house. So we're gonna break up into three groups, follow the instructions to a T and we should be able to make it. Any questions let me know, coffee's brewing, let's get to it, okay? Come take a look. So, we'll just frame up the walls, so we can put up enough space. ♪ Now it's that time a year when magic's in the air ♪ ♪ There's so many smiley faces love is everywhere ♪ You guys good? ♪ You can hear those carol sounds ♪ ♪ Right outside your front door ♪ ♪ That's when you know it's almost Christmas ♪ ♪ Chestnuts roasting shambling toast ♪ ♪ And frosty in the snow ♪ Put this one facing up, Mason can you give me a hand?

Get home safe, bye. Hey. Hi, thank you so much, I really owe you one. No, no way, I had a blast. If you need help any with the roofing, siding, flooring, whatever, just let me know. I think we got it covered actually. Right, yeah, right. Thanks Scott. No problem. What was that? What? He's just trying to help. Or something. Oh, what do you care, huh? And besides if people wanna help, we should let them. Oh really? Then why didn't you let me pay for the roof? Just help me with the tarp, okay? Do you really hate me that much? I don't hate you. It sure feels like that. Silly carpenter lady can't hold up her end of the deal, handsome designer pulls off miracle and makes it happen. How many times did we do that storyline in season one? You're a structural engineer and a businesswoman and... People don't care about that, they believe what they see. Okay, it's one thing for you to show up here and draw attention to the project, but what if Mr. Adams and the mayor see you as the captain of the ship? Then what happens when you leave? Okay, and with our company on the line, I just can't risk it. Wait, what do you mean company on the line? Is everything okay? Blair, talk to me, if there's anything I can do... I don't need you to do anything but get that ladder and help me with the tarp, okay? Please. Hey. The house looks great, the framing looks done. Yeah, it is. So we're ahead schedule then? Yes ma'am. Oh, a lot of Mason looking buff in these shots. How does he always manage to do that? I don't know, but it's working. People are sharing that all over social. And you are ignoring those comments about Casey, right? Yes, of course. Because no matter what's going on between them they've only known each other for a year. You were together a decade. Eight years actually. Same thing. Well, it doesn't matter anymore Mason is free to do whatever he wants. Well we don't even know if they're a real thing. Have you seen season two? Every episode is just a massive flirt fest. Well, you should know better than anyone not to believe everything you see on TV. You could just ask him. Ask me what? Well, look what the cat dragged in. It's been a minute, huh? Too long. So I've lined up a few willing shelter guests, to chat to today. Oh, that's great, thank you so much. And then I figured I'd put you two to work. Great, I'm game whatever you need. Yeah, just don't ask him to cook. Trust me I would never, lest we forget Thanksgiving 2016. Oof. So the turkey was a little under cooked, so what? Yeah, but how do you mess up the mashed potatoes? You were the one in charge of the potatoes. Wow, I guess I didn't get that memo. Yeah, sure. And this is why you two will only be serving the food. Smile and scoop, copy that. Let me just get my coat, we can go. You know, quiet pining, isn't gonna be enough to win her back. Ready? So I got a company in Pittsburgh to donate forming for us. Oh great. And I think we can pick up the sinks and faucets at that company we used to use, when we first started out, hometown discount. Oh good. But I couldn't find any countertops, so we're gonna have to pay full price. But I sent you an email with a bunch of different options. Cool, whatever you think is good. Really? Yeah. Why are you being so agreeable? What do you mean? Isn't that a good thing? It's weird and it's not like you. What? Nothing, I'll meet you there, okay? Yeah, okay. Enjoy, alright, feel free to get some desert. Gotta hand it to the guy, he knows how to work a crowd. I grew up not far from here. He sure does. Listen, hey, have you heard about Vista Village? It's a tiny home community, we're trying to build, we'd love your opinion on the design. I mean, this is your community, it's our home, you should have a say. Here you go, enjoy. I'm gonna get started. Are you good here? Yeah, go ahead. Do you mind? Yeah, sure. You guys go grab some dessert, okay? I see you dragged old Mason back from the land of eternal sunshine. We did. Did you get a chance to meet him? Yeah, he was great. Did he tell you about Vista Village? A little. Do you have any insights on the home? There was one thing. What is it? I was thinking when a resident moves in, maybe they could... they paint the door their favorite color. I know you guys probably have a whole scheme picked, but I thought it might be nice, people could make it feel more like home. Just for a little bit. Wow, Kirk, that is a really good idea. Really? Yeah. Wow, cool, thanks. No, thank you. Oh, what is your favorite color? Probably blue, my wife loved it. Blue it is. Hey Jared, how's it going? Good good, just calling, checking in on you, see how you're doing? Yeah, I'm great. Hey, full disclosure saw pictures of you and Blair online. Oh. -She's doing some sort of tiny home project or something? Yeah, something Blair is doing for our town, should be done by Christmas. It's good to see you supporting, you know, it's nice to see she's found her niche. Her niche? Yeah, it seems like a good fit. Oh. Come on, you know how Blair can be, she's kinda... Honest. Yeah, I was gonna say earnest, but Because she wouldn't jump through your hoops? Alright, yeah forget about Blair, you sign the contract? I'm gonna need more time. Mason, I know there's a lot, of nitty gritty stuff in there, but we need that signed by Christmas. Whoa whoa, wait wait, I thought I had till New Year's? I'm getting a lot of pressure from the Network, they need to know when they can announce season three. You think you'll get a lot more pressure, if I quit? I'll call you later. Are you quitting? I don't know. You don't know? We are days away Mason, how could you do that? Oh, I get it, you think this is about your project, don't you? One minute you're telling me to back off and the next you want me to stay? I don't get it. We can't keep doing this Blair. Look, if you don't wanna work with me, I will step aside and you can take over. What? No, that's not what I'm saying. You can coordinate with my dad, and I'll just... Stop. You're not leaving. This is your project, I'm just trying to help, but you won't let me. Talk to me, Blair. I... What do you want? I want you to pick the countertops and the back splash, and the light fixtures, and I just wanna show up and install them all, okay? I want this tiny home to help our community. Okay. Thanks sweetie. You know, if you're trying to get your 10,000 steps in, you may want to head outside. Haha, no, I'm just trying to figure out the layout. Can I see the plans? Yeah. Oh-oh, I know that face, what's wrong? I don't think we have enough room for stairs. What? If we want a full size couch, we should use a ladder instead, and build closet space inside the bathroom. I mean, if you're okay with it? Yeah, I'm okay with it. Great. Speaking of full size couches, that's the furniture store. Blair Callahan speaking. Oh. Okay. Yeah, thanks for letting me know. Yeah, Merry Christmas, to you too. What happened? They canceled their donation. What? Can they do that? I guess they got a contract, with a big hotel chain, and they don't have any surplus stock, so. I don't know what we're gonna do. We're supposed to reveal a fully furnished, tiny home to the town tomorrow. I can call Hammonds in the next town. My place. What? We can use my furniture. I mean, I was gonna have to sell it all anyway. It's a great idea. But are you sure? Absolutely, whatever you need. Why don't you both go look around and I'll finish up here. That way we can furnish this place tonight. Oh no dad, that's okay, I can stay and help. Nonsense, it's nothing, you're gonna need two sets of hands to carry all that stuff anyway. You game? Okay. Okay, so we're looking for a couple of small chairs, or stools, a table, any extra lighting that you have... Yeah. Baskets for storage and is there any decor you think would look good? Lots. Oh this would be perfect. Wow, I love this place. I forgot how beautiful it is. Hey, where's my old rocking chair? Oh, I don't know. My mom stays here, when she comes to visit her friends. Maybe she got rid of it. Oh, that's too bad. Wow, you really went all out, huh? I actually had some home stages, come and spruce the place up. Well it looks great, but this view sells itself. We could always go for one last polar bear dip. Oh. It's good for the circulation. Yeah, nothing like the primal instinct, to survive to get the blood pumping. I can't believe I ever let you talk me into that. I'm freezing just thinking about it. Well, walk around, pick up what you like, I'll make us some hot chocolate. Okay, if you insist. Hey, do you still have those paintings from your design school days? I doubt it, I think they're all boxed up. They should probably stay that way. Come on you're pretty good. What do you think about these side tables for the loft? I could replace the legs on them. It's not a bad idea, we can probably add some storage too. Yeah, it's perfect. Oh, I wish this couch fit though. Oh, just as comfy as I remember. Feel free to add some coffee in that hot chocolate. I don't know how you're still standing. Just used to it, I guess. Ugh, TV hours. That's one thing I don't miss. What about the rest of it? Yeah, there are definitely some things I miss but I had no choice, I had to come home. See, that's where you lose me. Well, when the McAllister Plant shut down, business dipped everywhere, construction slowed, and my dad had to let go of most of his staff and manage the place by himself. If I didn't come back when I did... Wow, I- I didn't know. Why didn't you come after me when I left? I had to pick up the pieces after you left, save the show. Where were you? I needed a clean break. I couldn't take being undermined by Jared, the show, you. We were a team. Yeah, well you didn't exactly fight for us. The network loved you, we were great together. We had chemistry. Until we didn't. My life isn't about ratings, Mason. We were paying our dues, and I honestly believe, that we'd have eventually been a to negotiate producer credits and take back control of the narrative. You really think Jared would've let us do that? I'm in a more powerful position now after two seasons and I can negotiate a better deal. Well, that's great for you and Casey. Blair, wait. You're right, okay. I should have stood up for you back then, I was an idiot. And if I could go back. What's done is done, Mason. I'm glad it worked out for you, honestly. That's the electrician, I should take this. Yeah, okay. Casey, how are ya? Excellent, all we need is a counter signature and it's a done deal. Okay, yeah, I'll look it over. If you do it right now, we can still catch happy hour across the street. I need the studio to approve it, so let's just take a minute. Did you get Mason's contract back yet? It's in progress. Is there anything else going on here I should know about? No, definitely not. Because I saw those pictures of Mason with Blair online, people are tweeting about a reunion. I would hate to find out I'm being fired from a tabloid. Blair's not coming back, Casey. Well then sign my contract. I need Mason, I need him on board. He bridges the seasons together and he has final co-star approval, so. Okay. You want Mason to sign, I have an idea. Right, see you soon. Scott just called, he's on his way over with the truck. Perfect, we just have to have the house at town hall by three. Okay, hit the lights. Wait, what? Did you check the other end, is it plugged in? I'll go check the breaker. We only have two hours. I know, but we'll figure it out. Can't have a Christmas reveal without lights. There will be lights. And if there's not? Blair. Huh, it's not the electrical, these are just a bunch of duds. Seriously? - Unbelievable. - Never fails. I just really want Mr. Adams to see what we can do. Do not despair, I'll replace them now. Come on, we got lots to do inside. Hey. Hey. Could you grab me another ornament please? Yeah. - Yeah? - Thank you. Well, I hate to admit it, but the ladder it looks pretty good. So does your lamp choice. I have my moments. Yeah, I'll say. Hey aren't these, the tables from your house? Good eye. Didn't we get those on clearance in January for like eight bucks. Correction, you bought them. After you left, I went through all the closets and. You found the paintings. Yeah. Oh wow. Hey, isn't this... First house we ever reno'd together? Yeah. This looks perfect. Thank you. Wow, wait, you really pulled it off, Blair. No, we did. Yeah, we did. I should probably go. Are you okay here? Yeah. Okay, I'll see you later? I wouldn't miss it. ♪ See the snowfall on your shoes ♪ ♪ Dusted off those winter blues ♪ All the youths are spirit high ♪ ♪ Bells are ringing to the sky ♪ ♪ Big celebration ♪ ♪ I hear the children laugh and play ♪ ♪ Here's to vacation and Santa coming on his sleigh ♪ ♪ It may be Christmas ♪ ♪ Joy all around us ♪ Hey.

Well, well, well look at you. Not half bad for a guy living out of a suitcase. But you on the other hand, hmm. All right all right. Right, so the lights are good, the decor's finished and you added all the stuff from your place, right? Yeah, we went through the checklist, we're good. Okay. Wow, Blair, you look beautiful. All right, let's go close this deal. Huh? It looks great. Look at this thing, Wow. Oh here, take my picture. Okay. Oh, I love this. See why I like working on TV? Hey, just in time. Jared? Hey, sorry we didn't touch anything I swear. That's super cute, you guys did a good job. I don't understand. What are you doing here? This was rude, I'm so sorry, I'm Casey. I know who you are. Oh, we've gotta do a last minute announcement for season three, so we're just gonna need Mason for a sec. Jared. What announcement? I have no idea what they're talking about. Good evening, everyone, thank you so much for coming. We're excited to walk you through our vision for Vista Village, Great Oaks first ever tiny home community. As you know, our town has faced hard times these last few years. We've seen neighbors and friends lose their jobs, their savings, and in some cases, their homes. We've been working diligently to make this space a reality. But if you feel inclined to help us, you'll find donation bins around the room. I know we all wish there was something we could do to help, well this is our chance. So if you'll follow me. It's my pleasure to present to you, Vista Village's first ever tiny home. Woo. And the team behind the design, Blair Callahan and Mason Haines. Best thing you can do for Blair, is not make a scene. Is that? Hang tight for season three, we've got a big announcement coming up. This is low, Casey. It might not seem like it, but I am doing this for us, Mason. Hey Mason. If we sign on to season three now, the network will have to say yes to whatever we want. Huge raises, executive producer credits. This is our chance to make our mark. You've got a lot of grit, Casey. Blair, sorry about all the commotion. Yeah, right. Do you have any idea what you've done? Mason and Casey are out there being interviewed about this whole thing. Frankly, I think the press is eating it up. You have some nerve. I'm sorry, isn't this what you wanted? Mason to use his profile, to help you with your little pet project? No one forced him to do this, he made a choice. Evidently it was a good choice. He's never been in a better position to negotiate anything he wants. Come on Blair, don't take it personally, just show biz. No, it's not Jared. This is about real people with real problems. Something that you would know nothing about. Blair, Mr. Adams is waiting outside, he's ready for the tour. Let's go seal the deal. Come on in. So as you can see the home was designed for efficiency and comfort at every turn. We made use of the vertical walls, by adding built-in shelving. And we opted for a ladder to access the loft instead of stairs to save space. Hmm. We chose a custom pine louvre door for the bathroom and even the furniture is multifunctional. Most pieces have built-in storage, like this table for example, which folds down when it's not in use. Nice. Yeah. And there's a fireplace. We wanted it to feel like a real home because giving people the dignity of shelters is the least we can do. Indeed, I really admire everything you and Mason have done here. I mean, it's a charming home and the city could certainly benefit from the village. I'm so glad you agree. Governor's on board too. We would love to complete this before the election next year. Oh, I think that's doable. I agree, which is why I sent out your pitch to tender earlier today. You, what? You're letting other companies bid on this? Well, it's a big project and we have to give everybody fair consideration. We do recognize a company of your size could struggle to scale up production. We can do this, we built this house in a week. And it's incredible. Blair, this is a big project that could grow statewide. We need to consider a company that has more manufacturing space, more capacity, deeper pockets. Whoever wins this tender, needs to execute a massive project on a deadline. Right, I understand. I appreciate this, Ms. Callahan and I thank you for your time. Oh, I'm here till tomorrow, so please submit your bid. You're not out of the running. Blair, I'm so sorry about all this, I didn't know they were coming, Jared set this up. Do you have any idea what you've done? How embarrassing this is? I'm sorry. It's smart, really smart of you, to use this as your springboard. Blair. You know me, does that sound like something I would really do? I don't know if I do know you anymore. Why are you even here? I just couldn't sign back onto the show until I talked to you. After we broke up, everything happened so fast, then suddenly season two is on the tracks and I'm getting sucked back in and I needed... What Mason, what do you need? You. I needed to see you. I missed you. I miss you. I really wanna believe that. Blair, please trust me, underneath all this it's still me. You sure about that? You should go. Hello? Hey. Hey, there you are, I've been calling. You okay? I guess, yeah. We got approval for the funding and that is the most important thing. You talked to Mason? Not since last night. You don't really think he's in on that whole designed weller, charade, do you? He looked like a deer in the headlights when that spotlight turned on. I don't know, wasn't he? There's no way he would've done that to you, even after everything. I can't think about that right now. You and Jim will be okay. I think we might need a miracle at this point. I don't think you do. Do you remember when you built that bird house? Yeah, we built for that injured baby nuthatch. We called it Cashew. Yeah, and after you built Cashew's birdhouse, you promptly declared your intention to build one for every other bird on earth. Little too ambitious, perhaps. Yeah, but that's who you are Blair, you've never been afraid to take a challenge. You're always getting people excited with your passion and your story. Well, this is a lot bigger than a birdhouse. You'll figure this out. Hey man, thanks for calling, means a lot. Look, I wanna apologize, we came to town without warning. I put you on the spot. That was wrong. All right. That's it? What do you mean? That's the only thing you got to apologize for? What about not telling me the real reason Blair left the show? And how many other things did you keep from me? Hey man, look, say what you wanna say but I got you a rocket of a contract here, a rocket. All right, this thing's gonna set you up for life. Don't be a fool, Mason. What kind of life is that gonna be though? We came to LA to do your show, thinking we were gonna help people. Then suddenly it became about flipping vacation homes. Yeah man, people love that. Right, that's fantasy. I get it, but it's not us. Blair was right. No, Blair was wrong, all right, you two had everything. She walked away, she couldn't hack it. You know what I believe? I believe you're at the top of your game. I believe you've worked incredibly hard to build up a show that she left. You belong here. Don't let Blair drag you down again, all right. Drag me down? I know what I'm talking about, Mason, just. Blair's got more grit and conviction and passion than anyone else on that network, myself included. And if you were as half as good at your job as you claim to be, you'd be banging on her door right now begging for forgiveness, instead of wasting your time with me. All right, just hang on a sec, Mason... No, I am done, Jared. Hey, so I've pulled up all our outstanding invoices, and if we can collect 70% of payments, we can make it until spring. And in the meantime, I'll work on securing a few custom home contracts for the summer. There's no guarantee we could collect what's owed before the bank comes knocking. I think it's time to call it, Blair. No, Dad. At least if we file now we can pay folks what they're owed by the new year. It's not over yet. It is, honey. It is. Trust me, I don't take this lightly, I've worked my whole life and my career like this not able to leave you anything. Oh no, Dad, don't say that. I'm the one who came up short. I put all our eggs in this basket. No, you've knocked it out of the park, I've never been prouder. Well you deserve more the only thing giving me solace right now is the idea that if we do file, at least you can start with a clean slate. No more dark clouds hanging over your head. Working here isn't a dark cloud. It's taught me everything I know about being a good boss, a good friend, a good citizen. I am not ready to throw in the towel yet. Okay, I'm with you kid. Okay, look at this, I have another idea. Kirk, hi. Quinn gave me your message, what's up? What's this? It's an early Christmas present. Well, no, I can't accept this. Take it up with Santa, I'm just the messenger. But Blair, this... Kirk, it's yours, the mayor's already approved it and besides it would be a shame to have to repaint the door. Thank you. Kids, we're gonna have our own home for Christmas. Oh my God, really? I'll let them know. I mean I've worked with them before. Blair, welcome. Thank you both for meeting me on such short notice. After our meeting I reached out to an old contact at Home Garden Life Network and we came up with an agreement. They would like to finance a show about the construction of Vista Village. Each week we would tell the story of a new resident and custom design a tiny home based on their needs. Not only is the network willing to back this show but they are gonna carry 50% of the project costs. Wow. That would certainly take the sting out of the cost for the state. Please sit. Oh. May I? Yes. Thank you. Then there's the secondary benefits more press for the cause for our city, not to mention all the jobs that would bring to our town, trades people, film crews, you name it. We could even help find jobs for the residents if they need it. And I take it your company would be the lead on this. Yes, we are in a unique position to handle the demands of this project. Not to mention it would be a great opportunity for you and the governor to support local small business. Most importantly, if we are really committed to helping our unsheltered community, this would go a long way in doing that. We could reach a massive audience with this kind of platform. Change some hearts and minds and maybe even inspire some folks to do the same thing in their cities. Well, Blair, this is quite an exciting proposition. And Mr. Adams, if you're interested, we could certainly get you on the show. Oh, come on now. So, what do you think? I love it. There she is, Mayor Hunt says, they wanna get started right away. Congratulations, honey. Thank you, dad. I've been going over some numbers, I think I've figured out a way to get us through the New Year till we wrap up on the show. That's great. Yeah, it is. You did it, Blair. I'm really proud of you. So, how do you wanna celebrate? Pizza, movie night? What are you thinking? Oh. What is it? I don't know. I mean, I know I should be feeling over the moon and I am, but I also. Blair. What? Just call him. Who? For all I know he could be long gone by now and I don't know, I mean shouldn't I be doing this on my own now? You know, I think building a life, on the shoulds instead of the wants, that's a slippery slope. Here we go again with the quotes of the day. Okay, laugh all you want, but it's the truth. You have a chance for a clean start here. What do you want your future to look like? Thought so. So you better hop to it, before he catches a plane back to LA. Thank you, dad. You're welcome. Now get going. Okay. Mason. Mason. Mason. You're still here. Yeah. Did you get a good price at least? Turns out it's not a good time to sell and besides, I just couldn't leave behind this chair. Listen Blair, you were right, about everything, I am so sorry, I never should have let you walk away. It's not all on you. I so badly wanted to change the world and you know, when the show didn't pin out the way... I ran, from the show, from you, from all of it. But I am done running. In fact, I have another show idea. Oh really? We're building Vista Village with Home Garden Life Network and as one of the producers, apparently I have co-star approval. That's huge. Yeah, and I think I might know a decent designer. Is that so? Yeah, but if he stays he's gonna have to let me demo his kitchen, finally. See, that's where I draw the line. Only residents of the home are allowed to request renovations. Well then I guess I'll have to change my address. Well there's only one thing left for me to say. What? Welcome home. Merry Christmas Blair.
