''The Center, Blue Cove, Delaware'' Behold the scrolls. They are not here. The Pretender The Island of the Haunted Talk to me, daddy. This is not the way it's supposed to be. Catatonia. It's a schizophrenic disorder, marked by stupor and mutism. No doubt brought on by the trauma of the gun shot head wound he suffered. Can you wake him up? Oh, he is awake. He is just trapped in there. I'd like to be alone with my father. ... you are my real father. Daddy. Are you in there, daddy? Look at this. It was sent to me anonymously. Do you have any idea why my mother and Jarod's mother are together? I didn't even know they knew each other. Is this what you have so much to tell me about? Hey, sis. You got to get out of here. Why? They say so. What are Adama and his Triumvirate goons doing here? Well, now our dad is awake and ... conscious. They're taking over his protection ... Why? They are afraid of what he might say? Or he might drool on? I don't know. But I have a feeling it has something to do with the vault, on SL-15 that blew to pieces last night. Looking for what? How if I know? Well, you bet Raines has something to do with this. Doubt it. He hasn't even resurged from his latest disappearing act. Truth is, don't know, don't care. When these craziest ... get this pissed off, all I do is follow orders. And now that Dad's brains are as scrambled as yesterday's eggs. You'll need somebody else put in charge around here. Consider me an applicant. If it isn't another Parker, surprised to see you here. Are they? - Considering my family has been running this place... - Triumvirate runs the Center. You leave us now. You harm one hair on my father's head..., and so help me. I never like you, either. Miss Parker. Not now, Broots. No, no. It has to be now. I, I found Jarod. It's an ancient symbol of some sort. Yes. Eight skeletal figures on the circumference of the symbol. You've seen it? Do you have an address? I've been searching for this for weeks. I would be happy to hold. Oh, No. Oh, No. Come on. Come on. Come on. - Jarod Dodson? - Sixth floor. Yes, I have a pen. It's on the wall outside the Alley Sports Bar. Thank you very much. Find him. ''Miss Parker: Sorry, I missed you. J.'' What? You've been chasing me for five years, why don't you just leave me alone? You know that's not the way it is. My job is to catch and return you to the Center. You run, I chase, just like always. And I need answers. - About? - About who my real father is? About who I really am? Welcome to the club. That photograph that both of us've been emailed of our great mothers, what's it mean? You work for the Center. I thought you people know everything. I know this till I want you back. Why? Because I'm a pretender? Because I can become anyone I want to be? I'm not buying that one any more. - It's something else. - Just tell me what you know about that photograph. I'm not sure what it means but something tell me that it holds the key to this whole puzzle. And the first one to find the answers, wins. Jarod. The museum people say that Doctor Jarod was the funniest archaeo-symbologist ever worked for them. Yes, he's a regular laugh ... What exactly is an archaeo-symbologist? You know, it's the study of the orinigal unexplainable symbols passed on from the ancients. It's a quite exiting field. And I can just imagine the club circle discipline party's in your house. Is there any other symbol in particular interesting Jarod? No, the people at the museum said this was the only thing he looked at. Got a whole box full of different photo enhancements of it. It's creepy too. Eight skulls in a circle gurding some kind of giant chest in the middle. They said Jarod was possessed of finding out where it came from. Whatever the symbol means, Jarod's possession tells me it's personal. And the first one to the answers wins. - Uh, most people don't even notice the ... thing. - It's why I'm here. I've been doing some research on symbology which led me to this building. You arrived in some time for our going out of business sale. I swear this geogen got a "mojo" on it. Mojo? You know one of those locations where no matter what business you run out of it, the place goes barely out. I mean this is sports bar, right? It's out of college campus, I cannot give bill away. I'm looking for someone who may have been here years ago. Someone who might have been interested in the symbol on the wall. Oh, yeah, the crazy eight's, huh? Crazy eight's? That's what I call it. It gets you eight freaky dead guys in a circle there around that werid thing. Crazy eight's, they say it all started with the Vespusians. Vespusians? The secret society that was founded about a hundred years ago, made this right building. Secret society? You know, like the guys ride around the minibike with faces on. Anyway, rumor has it that some immigrant guy set up shop here, amassed a fortune holding this evil worship type meeting down the basement. Sounds a little farfetched, don't you think? Yes, that's what I thought at first too. They were trying to do a renovation in the basement, when they found all the stuff. Hey, buddy, here. They were going to have a second sewer line down here. Then a plumber uncoverd these. He, he wouldn't finish the job. I, can see it as a blamer. What the hell? Dame it, it's missing. What's missing? There was a blue box with a heart carved on it, with a porcelain doll inside it. The lady must have taken it. Lady? Yeah, a lady came down here couple of days ago. - Let me guess. She was brunette, tall, great legs. - No. No such luck. An elder lady asking questions about the symbols of the Vespusians. Oh, hold on. That's, that's already must know. It's on the picture with her. Are you sure? Yeah. I mean she was older. sure but ... she was there right where you on it a few days ago. Well, she means some to you? Yes. She's my mother. Did she say where she was going? Yeah, she said she was going back to, where the guy who built this place came from. Right there. An island off Scotland. It's called Carthis. All the spooky stuff must come from. What are you doing, Miss Parker? Searching for answers. I have to know whether daddy is my real father. Here is my genetic material. And get a sample of my father's and run a comparative. You father has been guarded by those psycho zulus. I don't think they are going to take too kindly to us plunging a needle in your old mas's arm. There's another way, Broots. The Centre??s bodily fluid storage facility. Bodily fluid storage facility? What the hell is that for? Blood storage for anyone important who may need a transfusion. Oh, I didn't take a mind. Get a sample of my father's. Parker, have you considerd the psychological implications? Sydney, please. Just do it. ''No Match Found'' ''No Match Found'' Miss parker, I don't know what you're looking for, but ... I'll be happy to help you. Thank you, Broots, but this is one mystery I have to solve myself. And there's only one person qualified to help. Angelo, I need you to use your gift as an empathy, and tell me what my mother and Jarod's mother were doing together. Miss Parker's mother... sad. Jarod's mother... frightened. What about what's on the wall, in the ivy? Vespusians. Vespusians... - Vespusians. Vespusians. - Angelo! Angelo, please. Calm down. Calm down. It's ok. Calm. Angelo, I need your help. What are Vespusians? Evil, evil people. Evil people! Evil people. Evil people. Evil People! Where can I find the evil people? Evil people. Place. Evil people, evil place. Evil people, evil place. Evil people, evil place! Angelo. Where can I find the evil people? On the island. The island of the haunted. Are you sure you want to go there? They say that the souls of the damned walk on the isle. I've been searching for years for answers that might be on that island. What is it you say you did again? I am an archaeologist. Yeah, Mr. Archaeologist, if the answers you seeked fall on the island, you've been better off not knowing them. Something that offended God himself happened on that land. Only evil live that place. I ferry people back and forth through it, ... it. And if I have to capsized right now, even with the greatest storm coming, I'd rather take my chances in the sea, than set one foot on that land. - Please, ... our notice. - What to scare? They don't call the devil's storm for nothing. I speak for everybody. When I say that, we don't feel safer. If we left. Since a huge storm brother announced us. Agreed. But I strongly believe it's course'll take it fifty kilometers to the east. As a matter of the caution, we can arrange for a couple of shallow boats to evacuate come only. If the storm changes course. I feel it will change course. It's time for the cleansing storm to come. We bear responsibility for the souls on this isle. Yes, please. Brother please. ... very well. Well I think the two of you have been overly ... as usual. I'll arrange to have the shallow boats prepared for dock. Thank you, brother. Excuse me. To whom does one speak about accommodations? Well, that would be me, I'm brother Rinaldus. This is brother Menenicus and brother Clote. I cann't say as I wasn't informed to expect a stranger. My name is Jarod. I'm looking for refuge. I was told that no traveller seeking sanctuary on these shores would be turned away. Of course. - Brothers, please. - Thank you. Watch you step. Much of the monastery are over seven hundred years old. All build by the brothers before us, most of whom were better brandy makers than masons. So the rumor of the monastery it was built by ... a Knights Templar is true? True or not, christians like that should best be addressed to brother Rinaldus. Though I doubt anyone can picture me as blown into some secret society of warrior monks, unless of course the weapon of choice ... No more than standards, the ... is primitive with no electric, no phones and very little running water. This will be just fine. As a matter of fact, it sort of reminds me the place I grew up in. Think of the isle, it's a good place to get away from the modern world. - And what about other visitors? - This address. Let's say someone was looking for me. If someone were looking for you, or you are looking for them, you've been in a wrong place. For centuries, the vespusian brothers have made this a place of refuge. Privacy of our guests has always been the rule... Thank you. Jarod. Jarod. Jarod. Help me. Mummy, no. What's going on? Evacuation. The storm changed course in the night and doubled in size. It's the doubled strom strong enough to take ..., and it's heading straight for this isle. The bell's announcing evacuation and half the island's already gone. - They're already gone? - The next set of bell announces the last boat. Be on it! Wait, I cann't leave. Brother Rinaldus ... all of it. Listen to the bell. Save your life. Excuse me. - Have you ever seen this women on this isle? - No. Excuse me, have you ever seen her? - Excuse me... - No. Mum. Mum. Excuse me. Excuse me, where's everyone going? Up there is a bad storm coming. If you are smart, you'll leave too. Weather updates I don't need, answers I do. Is this where about? Off the yards way, cos it's the Chapel of Souls. It's up the path, ... How about this man? Have you seen him? Vespusians speak of no visitors here. God be with you. Where's Adama get this Triumvirate freak anyway? They need the Center sweepers look like ... - You are certain about their shifts you get, Broots? - According to Miss Parker, they swap out every six hours. Speak of Miss Parker, what she has been out there anyway? She can at least have the decency of ... It's ... It's... Oh, god. It's placenta and cord blood samples from Brigitte and Mr. Parker's baby boy. Not to sound cynical or anything, but if anyone has seen that little kid lately. Oh, Jes. What is it? I'm so underpaid. Miss Parker owes me so big. Is that Mr. Parker's blood? I wish it were Mr. Parker's blood. The only sample of Mr. Parker's in here is semen. Let's get the hell out of here. ''Ocee's Herbal Remedies'' Can I be of help, stranger? I'm just... leaving, like everyone else. It's sad to be alone. I'm terribly sorry to intrude. Not intruder. You are the seeker. Shouldn't you be preparing to evacuate from the storm? Aren't you afraid of what's coming? Ocee's journey almost done. Yours, just beginning. - Yours, full of pain. - Pain? You have a broken heart. You have not found the loved one you seek. The woman with the scarlet hair. Hello. It's in the chapel. What's in the chapel? Wait. Tell me what you know about the woman with the scarlet hair. I saw her earlier, but I lost her. The one you seek, seeks you as well. Ocee, help me. Please. Ocee? What's the matter? Danger. She's in danger. - Now. - Where? Chapel of Souls. The Chapel of Souls. My god, you look just like her. Wait. Next time you slamed me like that, you'd better make it count. - Miss Parker. - Drop this price crap, Jarod. First one to the answers, wins. That is what you said, isn't it? My mother is on this island. I have reason to believe she is in danger. Now it's not the time to play Center bounty hunter. Now, where is your mother? - You saw her? - Yeah. Just now she was panicked and her arm was bleeding. She was hurt? Oh, god, that's the last shuttle boat off this island. Answers we've both been searching for could be leaving right now. Please. Wait, stop the boat. Boat. Boat. Ah, no. Forgive me, the Lord. Forgive me. She was right here. My mother was right here in front of me. Once again, it's the Center that stops us from being together. Where do you think you are going? In case you haven't noticed, that's the last boat off the island. We are alone now. So you can shoot me if you want to. I'm going to find out what my mother was doing here. And why someone tried to kill her to stop her from doing it. Lyle. You took my thumb. You weren't using it at the time. A digit is the least I could give you for the favor I'm about to ask. The primary results for BN can last for only twenty-four hours. - I tried to contact Miss Parker, but ... - I couldn't find her either. I don't get it. Her father's genetic test result was so important to her, now they are during motion, she happens to disappeare. That's surely weird. - Yes, I don't like her to stay out of contact. But ... - No, no, no, no. That. There. Mr. Raines is back. Something really strange is going on around here. Come on. I found your mother in here after I heard the gun shot. She was by the confessional. That's my mother's blood. Somebody's boot print with a crack in the heel. Must belong to the man who shot her. And knocked me out. He leaves this way. Jarod, look, you mother was carrying that. There's blood on it. Oh, it's empty. Serves for the impressional a small body. My mother found the doll in the building where she and your mother were photographed in front of. This must be the box it came in. P-47 What does that mean to you? Nothing. Yet. So much for being alone on the island. Hey. Ocee? Why didn't you leave with the others? Ocee born here, Ocee die here. Did she get off the island alright? Did who get off the island? The woman with scarlet hair. Your mother, of course. How did you know she was my mother? You are Jarod, aren't you? ''Ocee's Herbal Remedies'' You mother came to me for herbs. Complaining her headaches. But it was easy, even for a blind woman, to see, that it was her heart that was aching, and that she feared for her life. Ocee. What was my mother searching for? Find out who you are. What do you mean? Who I am? All I know is what she spoke, she and another woman, had been trying to discover the truth, for a long time. That must have been your mother. You sure you're blind? Sight may come from one's eyes, but the vision comes from one's heart. Jarod, if you mother was searching for something in the chapel, maybe the little girl can tell us where it was. The girl? I was led to the chapel by a little girl with long, light brown hair. Is a girl on this island? Are you sure? Lady, I have no wonder knows what eyes are. Little girl or not, Ocee, tell me, what was my mother searching for? She was searching for the scrolls, of course. Any change? You have a purpose for being here? Yes, we have a call coming in from Africa. It's been requested you take it on a secure line. There's one at the end of the hall. Put it through. Just a second. It's sad I was made to see you in this way. I know you are in a great ... That's why I'm here. I came out of love. I'm sure the call will be coming through in any second. You and I've always been closer, than anyone here has ever known, ever suspected. I know you can never truly acknowledge our relationship, especially to Catherine, but because of our bond, I had to come. Tell me the truth. Are you faking this? Please tell me. I can help. I want to help you. I want to show you something. It's the truth, isn't it? Tell me all, tell me the truth. We don't have much time. Hey, what are you doing? It's emergent, they'll call you back. Adama, Adama, wait. Adama. Adama, wait. Don't leave him alone. What is this place? It's the crypt room. It was built on the souls of the original monk warriors who brought the scrolls to this island and founded the order. Literally on their souls. The legends are not ... When brother Vespus and his disciples returned from the crusades, they brought with them mystic scrolls of biblical proportions. You mean like the holy grail or something like that. Something exactly like that. The monks have given their solemn word to ... that they will bury the scrolls in the sea, but instead, they brought them here and hid them. Over centuries, seekers of destiny have come to the isle, seeking the scrolls and their mystic power, and that many searchers have ventured into the woods, never to return at all. It's said that the fate of the one who dares defile the scrolls, will be filled with eternal damnation. And yet my mother was trying to find them? The scrolls had everything about the man, whose footsteps you now are both walking. I don't understand. ... that a hundred years ago, the crypt-keeper of this vicinity found the Vespusian scrolls, ... that he planned to leave Carthis with them. And therefore he was made to pay a devastating price for his bargain with the devil. That night, by his hand, his entire family burned to death in their cottage. My god! He left the isle the next morning. And what about the scrolls? No one knows for sure, where they are or they are for what. Some say that they are gospels, written in the hand of God. Others scribblings from the paw of Satin. Whatever they are, they contain a power no man should encounter. My mother was also searching for something called P-47. The island is parceled out in numbered plots, all of which are registered at the monastery archives. Come, I'll show you. The answers you search for are in that building. Come on. In the chapel. I'll meet you inside. The storm is getting worse. Don't stay out here too long. Miss Parker's pop vanishing acting, never guess who she talked to last. You see? How could this be drawn, Syd? The same symble that Jarod was investigating. And those words. Terribilis est locus iste. It doesn't sound good. What's it mean? Terrible things happen here. Great. ''Terribilis est locus iste'' Where are you? It's in the chapel. What's in the chapel? Wait. It's me. Where is she? - Ocee has back to the cottage. - No, not Ocee. The little girl. Little girl? - Nobody here but us. - She was here, and she led me to that. Must be the doll from the box. Maybe your mother dropped this when she was shot. Why she hid it here? She must have been here searching for something. Like she was at P-47. Did you find out where it is? And what? It's the cottage. Where the crypt-keeper murdered his family. Let's get out of here. There it is. P-47. What was left of it? I've never seen it rained and snowed at the same time. Well, it is the devil storm. No. No, daddy. No. How could a man destroy his family just for his pursuit of greed and power? Why don't you ask your father that? What is it? It's a muddy footprint, just like we saw in the chapel. And it's fresh. Hey. There are nothing for you over there. It's over here. Follow me. Wait, wait. Wait for me. Miss Parker. Are you alright? What's wrong? She led me here so I'd know where I come from. What do you mean? The crypt-keeper's family! ''In Ever Loving Memory Parker'' ''In Loving Rest Parker'' They're who I am. ''In Loving Rest Parker'' Brother Menenicus was right. This is the doubled storm. You were lucky to make it back alive. It's not just a storm. We are now alone here. You are shivering. Give me those wet clothes to dry. Man, my feeling was justified. Feeling? My feeling that the only goodness left on the island, is the connection between you and Miss Parker. No, thank you. It's not for you. Go to her. It's not exactly the monk's brandy, but Ocee said it's good for emotional upheaval. Does she back a truckload of it to my house? The storm rage outside, Miss Parker. Not inside you. Easy for you to say, Jarod. The graveyard full of Parker's burned to death by their father. My great-grandfather. The same year that my great-grandfather arrived alone. And founded the Center. Generation after generation, that evil has been passed down to me. You know who you are. I'm a Parker. And with a new revelation of my life, my family portrait becomes a more hideous picture. Do you remember when we were kids, that night, that I sneaked you into her father's office? You said that if I was really a genius, I'd be able to figure out where he hid the present that he bought you on his business trip. And later you found it exactly where I said it would be. Yeah. Only It wasn't, I just told you that it was because I was so disappointed. My fathe lied about buying it. The pathetic part's that happened, searching for that gift from daddy ever since. Your father. The Center manipulations what they do. The only present they ever left us was those... emptiness. And those Parker graves out there go away beyond empty. - which bring me back to wondering... - Who it is you really are? I don't know now if I really ever want to know. Yes. Yes, you do. The Center wanted us to believe that finding the truth is a mistake, that looking for answers about who you really are is futile, and finding any kind of connection, outside their control is wrong. I know you don't want to hear this. But you can feel it. You have been the Center prisoner all these years just like me. With every discovery you find, you... you are every bit the outcast, just like me. Why is it that the one person ... that I have been trained... to distrust? to hate? to capture? He's always with me. During the most difficult moments of my life. Maybe, it's supposed to be that way. I don't want to interrupt, would anyone care for more tea? Ocee, please let me help you. Thank you. It's her. Who? It's the little girl that led me to the chapel. Can not be that little girl. It is her. And she's holding the doll. Impossible. This little girl is the crypt-keeper's daughter. She's been dead a hundred years. Oh, Syd, I am worried about Miss Parker. Me too. I am afraid there are no answers to her whereabouts here. Her house either. I invited myself in through her bathroom window. Look at this. I wasn't the only one who'd broken into her house looking for her. Somebody besides us is damn interested in finding her too. I wonder where she is. Angelo. What's he trying to tell us? Terribilis est locus iste. Terrible things happen here. Terrible things happen where? 19-240-86 What's it mean, Angelo? All about the Parker's. Truth about the Parker's. Terrible things. The sketch is a self-portrait of the little Parker girl. She gave it to the priest in the chapel, Father Theo, on the day she died. - What a tragedy. - Oh, yes. Their's and his. His? The night the crypt-keeper's family's burned to death, Father Theo also died. Mysterious accident. He supposedly felt from the chapel balcony. My father was a good friend of Father Theo's. He got all of his personal items, including the sketch of Angel, which was clutched in his hands when he died. Did you just call her Angel? That's what her father called her. Does that mean something to you? Everything means something. The Father Theo was clutching this when he died, that meaned something too. We need to find out everything we can about Father Theo. All his belongings are in the archive chamber. Evil scrolls, ghosts, a little family arson, all a perfect Parker fit. Call me crazy but I'm ready to believe in curses. Well, curse don't last. The scrolls are of a so-called value that my mother was willing to risk her life to find them. Here is Father Theo's chest. Just where Ocee said it would be. The Father Theo. Combo belongings of a combo man. And a dead end. Maybe. And maybe not. What? You see all the bindings are loose in the photo here. But it's got a restitch here. It's a letter that Father Theo wrote to his bishop in Glasgow. And it's dated the day Father Theo died. Bless me your holiness for I break the sanctity of confessional as I commit these words to paper. This eve the daughter of the local crypt-keeper spoke of such terrible ... are right. Her father, she claims, discovered ... sacred scrolls, The demons now have turned this once loving man into a tormented soul. In trying to save him from eternal damnation, she took and rehid the scrolls along with three other items, a leather pouch, a porcelain doll, and an eerily accurate self-portrait. She said they were to remember her by, as if she had realized her time upon this earth was nearing it's end. Her wills regarding these scrolls terrified me, your holiness. While she told me the location of the scrolls, she holds the key to find them still. It's unfinished. He must have been interrupted when he wrote this, and hid it in this bible, so it wouldn't fall into the wrong hands. My great-grandfather must have discovered that his daughter had confessed to Father Theo, and killed them trying to find these scrolls. She tried to save her father from these evil demons, only knew that it would cost her life. Father Theo writes: she holds the key to finding the scrolls still. She holds the key... Not her. Your great-grandfather must have brought this to America, and my mother brought it back with her for her search. She holds the key. Father Theo hid the scrolls and put the key to finding them inside her doll. And I know what it opens. I figured out what the numbers meant. The ones that Angelo wrote. Nineteen, SL nineteen, Two forty, Room 240, eighty six, Lockbox No. 86. So I broke in and I found this. - Parker, alright? - A death certificate, and an adoption certificate and a birth certificate, all issued within three days of each other all in the Parker family name. So you said Mr. Parker had a brother? His name was Able Parker, almost died at birth. then spent three secret days in an incubator a rush adoption was arranged, and the baby was sent off at this, I cannot even believe this... Mr. Parker's father bucked and paid for a bogus death certificate, all in the name of Able Parker, like the baby didn't even exist, like the wiggled limb of the Parker family tree was just cut off. - It's unbelievable. - No, no. You haven't seen it, nothing yet. Look at the name of the family that adopted the baby. ''Last Name Raines'' Raines. Am I crazy? Or this does mean that Mr. Raines is really... Mr. Parker's brother. So what does the key fit? Under the altar of every Catholic church there is a secret chamber, which hides the relics of each church's patron saint. And it was nothing. - Angel's leather pouch. - I'll take that. Brother Menencious. Give me the pouch. Tell me something here. Brother, why don't you leave the isle? Too busy trying to kill my mother? Too busy trying to keep us from the truth? In seven hundred years, there has always been a Vespusian brother on the island protecting the scrolls. I wasn't going to be the one to leave them unguarded. As for your mother, I don't know what you speak. Don't you lie to me. This isn't about lies. It's you won't give me the pouch, you can return to hell with it. He's locked us in, Jarod. These barrels are going to blow. There's no way out. There is one. Come on. Are you alright? I have been there. Ocee. Come on. Ocee. Ocee. Did Menencious do this? No, destiny. Just curse of scrolls. ''Ocee's Herbal Remedies'' Are you alright? Confused. Do you believe what Ocee said about these scrolls have been cursed? It doesn't matter what I believe. Too many people are dying trying to find them. A demon, a serpent and a cherub. They're all looking at something. And it's in Angel's handy with sketch. No, it's not just a sketch. It's a map. Directions left by the crypt-keeper's daughter to tell us where she re-hid the scrolls. But what is she telling us? The day and where it is. And they can see it. But where are they? I know where one of them is. This's the demon Asmodeus. Ogress, son of a bitch. ... All he's staring at is a blank wall. Perhaps. I tego. What's it mean? By itself, probably nothing. But my guess is that the cherub and the serpent are both looking at words. Clues that lead us to the scrolls. Jarod. Brother Menenacious? Something tells me he is not the one that kills Ocee. Someone who doesn't want us to find the scrolls. You take the serpent, I'll take the cherub. And watch your back. We are definitely not alone. Hello. I carved it myself. It's beautiful. Hope you'll find what you are looking for. ''arcana'' Thank you, Angel. Papa is the only one who calls me Angel. Friends call me Miss Parker. ''Rest in Piece Little Miss Parker'' ''Dei'' I found what the Angel was looking at. The word ''arcana''. The serpent is looking at ''Dei''. I tego arcana dei. But there is no block that the figure was looking at with those words on it. Yes. There is one. I got a bad feeling about this. About what? I was just passing by the infirmary, that's when I saw. You saw what? Nothing. No one. ... Broots, what are you talking about? Look around, Adama, the Triumvirate ..., Mr. Lyle, Mr. Parker, they'are all gone. They went off just like Miss Parker. Call her cell phone every five minutes if you have to. I don't know what any of these means, but we've got to find out. I tego arcana dei. What's it mean? Be gone, for I conceal the secrets of God. What secret secrets god has for us? That must be brother Vespus. And these, must be the scrolls. I power scrolls. We knew you could find them, but we were never able to. You must be the one that killed Ocee and brother Menenacious. And you are the one who tried to kill my mother. Acts that are done for God's good works. Should always remain acts of piety. And now, give me those scrolls. Daddy? Sure as Hell not Santa Clause. Brother Renaldus has been my faithful servant for years. But God does not forgive acts of aggression against one's mother. Neither do I, right, Angel? Now I can radio Adama we have the scrolls, and Jarod. Long live the Center. I've seen some bizarre things in my time, but nothing to compare with this. What is it, Syd? Mr. Parker's genetic test results. So is Mr. Parker really her father? Oh, my god. Syd, I don't believe this. You find them. Adama, you know a Parker never breaks his promise. especially when it concerns these scrolls. I look forward to communicating my pleasure to mu superior in flight. I cann't help but to imagine our mother's holding that box instead of them. And I cann't help but to imagine a different ending to all of this. What am I supposed to do, Jarod? Only you can answer that. I just hate to see anyone miss a turning point, when one is staring them right in the face. And I suppose you're going to open my eyes. I know you don't need me to do that. Only you can decide for yourself what ... take a hard look at your life. A way your mother once did. Did my mother have this, Ok? I am not her. Then who are you? Your father? It is Parker's legacy that you want to pass on to your children. We've been throught all together, you and me, from when we were kids at the Center, to the last couple of days, I know that rarely are ... are the same, but I've always felt... I've always known, that there was something more to our lives than I run and you chase. Maybe we do what we have to just to get by in this life, Jarod. Maybe we both deserve something more. Just, just forget what happened on that island. Forget the moment of weakness. Turning points only come when you've got something to turn to. I'm sorry. This isn't the different ending you were looking for. And it's just the way that damn story goes, Jarod. So wonderful thing you all like, Miss Parker. If you change story, the ending is up to you. Let's go, Daddy. Halt it. You are not going on this flight. - What? - And don't get all bent out of shape. I will explain everything to you back in Blue Cove. But daddy, the last time I saw you, you were in a catatonic stupor. - And... - It was just something that I cooked up with Raines and Lyle, to keep the Africans sniffing up the wrong flagpole, while you and Jarod found the prize. Daddy, is that true? The Parker's that found the scrolls was that my great-grandfather? And what about the scrolls? Is that true that they hold some kind of power? Not now. We'll solve everything out back in the Center. That's final. Just take a couple of days at the London house, it'll do you good. Hello. Parker. Thank god! It's us, Miss Parker. We've been so worried about... Did you just say hello? What, Broots? We've been trying to get in touch with you for days, where have you been? Somewhere between the hell and turning point. No, this is hell. Trust me, it's getting harder by the second. Did you find my father's blood sample? Blood? No. The only sample we got was semen. And is my father my father? The genetic lab did detect pattern similarities, so technically, you and your father could be a match. Technically was hardly arousing endorsement I was hoping for. Well, see, the thing is ... that your father's soda seems to be flat. Sydney, what is he talking about? A sample of Mr. Parker's sperm count is so low, especially stereo so the probability of him siring an offspring... that probability is small. How small? The odds against his ability to ever be a father would put that on... one in ten. Well, how could he be a genetic match and not be my father? Well, the only biological explanation is that your father could actually be your uncle. I don't have an uncle. Parker, there were further revelations. We found records. things that tell us your father actually did have a brother. who was giving up for adoption three days after his born. And the adopting family was name Raines. Are you telling me that Mr. Raines could actually be my father? Oh, I think I'm going to vomit. Adama has authenticated the scrolls for the Triumvirate. He is the happiest Zulu this side of Kampala. No surprise there. Yeah. I've had my fill of surprises, too. Like the one I just got about who my real father is. I'm still waiting for my answer. - Not now, Angel. - Don't angel me. I want to know which one of you two is my real father. Now. ... I don't know what this paternity suit thing is about, but I do know this is not the time or the place for it. Now when we get back to Blue Cove if we get back, we can talk about family matters then. What do you mean if? ... your bad luck, somebody don't want him to be suspicious. Suspicious of what? You, Miss Parker. You are being onboard fouls their plans to double cross Adama and the Triumvirate. You see another scrolls have been authenticated, Mr, Lyle and your father, or should I say fathers, are going to parachute out of here with their prized possessions, the scrolls and me. Unfortunately, I only see four parachutes and you, Miss Parker, make five. What's the advantage of betraying the Triumvirate? The supposed power that so called prophesies have been leveraged the Center's been using for years to keep the Triumvirate at bay. You people don't really believe those things are real now, do you? The only thing that really matters, is that the Zulu's believing. So if the scrolls' becoming the possessions of the Triumvirate in Africa, the Center's power base is history. Now I'm guessing your mother discovered this years ago. And if she found the scrolls, then... She would've had all the leverage of The Centre, Or the leverage to end it. Are we getting ...? Parker. Why is she on board? She just wanted to surprised her father, that's all. Take these three forward. Lock up the scrolls. Let me ask you a question. Did you ever love her? It's what little affection you've given her all the years she craves. I love my daughter more than anything on this planet. More than those scrolls? I find it pretty pathetic that you fashion your entire life around them. And you never even seen it. I learned those secrets from my grandfather, and there's nothing pathetic about his legacy, young man. Oh, yes. Burning his family to death. That's a hell like legacy to pass on to your... well, what you to call her now... daughter? Come on. Hundreds of people over thousands of years have sacrificed their lives to get a glimpse of those scrolls. And now you hold them in your hands. Aren't you a little curious? All that power. Make sure they are clean. Not today, cowboy. Do you mind if I get a blanket? Who keeps this damn jet is as cold as a morgue. Get your damn blanket and sit down. So Jarod was right. Tell Mr. Parker, we are on to get ready. Ready for what? Just do it. Adjust the air speed to 200 miles and the center 13000. And put it on auto-pilot. Now. Going to someplace? Just taking a journey that somebody should have taken a long time ago. Alone. What the hell are you doing? I've read the scrolls, Angel. And I'm returning them to the sea. It's the only way to stop the Parker madness. The madness that started the Centre. What? The scrolls are real. So it is the pain they inflicted especially on your mother. I know that now. I know that. It's time to fulfill her wish. And send this evil back where it belongs. It's controlled that family for too long. Hang on to something, Angel, you can't come with me this time. We are at 14000 feet and descending. Auto-pilot has been set to the coordinates as you requested. Then your services will no longer be needed. Daddy, are you just going to leave me here to die? No, no, you'll be alright. That's not they say how it ends. Wait, daddy. I have to know. Are you... my real father? I love you as my daughter, that's all that counts. Don't be sad. The new Parker legacy begins with you. God be with you, Angel. Wait. What the hell is going on? We've lost electronics, the flight panel is ... Get to the cargo hall. What happened? Daddy's jumped with the scrolls. And there is no parachute. Flight crews are dead and the controls are damaged. What the hell do we do now? Well, I would suggest that you un-cuff the one person that can fly this plane and save your lives. Do it. I have to get to the cockpit. Miss Parker, come with me. Auto control was down. Going have to find a ... way manually. Electronics was gone which means no gagues and no landing gear. ... coordinates the flight computer... ... to find the matching landing area. Got one. ... Airport, Morocco. ... This tool kit. Get to the rear of the plane and I'm going to shout out instructions, unless we fix these blown electronics, we are going down. Lyle, of the three panels the yellow one is burned down. We need to circumvent it. And re-establish the circuit by connecting the wire into the other two. Yellow to yellow, green to green, blue to blue. You'll blow up the whole system if even one wire is wrong. We are going down fast. Come on, come on. Ok, ok. What connects to go? - Damn. - What? We've got about thirty seconds before it's too late. Jarod, he's got three wires left, only one of them is blue. What should he do? Lyle, you have to choose carefully. Another word is: Guess. We have to pray he's right. Lyle, pick one. Damn it, pick one. Yes. Not so fast. What? The good news is we are going to be landing in about ten seconds, the bad new is the landing gear is not deploying appropriately. So hold on, we are going to crash. Jarod. Damn it. Come on, this thing it's going to blow. This must have been an emotionally trying time for you. Are you alright, Miss Parker? I don't know, Broots. But thanks. I just want everything to get... you know, I always say that I want everything to get back to normal. No such thing about here. Oh, no. ... now Raines is in charge. Raines? What had you heard? You looked surprised to see me. Well, after the way the Africans were behaving ... in Morocco, I figured it beheading was in order. After they understood that Jarod broke free on the jet, sadly killed Adama and his guards, and parachuted away with the scrolls, They were forgiving, especially proud of the way Mr. Parker gave his life trying to save what was theirs. Quite a bedtime story. They kept us alive. All of us. They need me, now more than ever. As well as my children. Jarod has to be returned. So... it's back to normal. With a twist. Whichever of you two brings Jarod back, will also have a long-term future here, and a future in the Parker legacy. And whoever fails? Be careful when you talk about beheadings. You brother has shown me a sign of loyalty. I'll be awaiting a sign from you. I'll have to get back to you on that. What? So what do you think they said? The scrolls? I was hoping you have some answers. Insights into the so-called prophecies. Those answers are somewhere in the ocean, along with my fa... Do you think that... there is any chance that he bailed out for the right reasons, Jarod? Or was his ... just another one of his lies? I don't know. Maybe it's time you give youself the gift he never give you. The truth. I hope you find your mother. And what about... us? You run, and I chase. That choice was made for us a long time ago. Maybe that is the Parker curse. Yeah. All of the life we have, Jarod. Only this time the first one who finds the answers, leaves. Jarod. The prophecies, if they were real, maybe we could've found out what our future would hold. If they're real. The Center shall rise. The chosen will be found. A boy named Jarod.
