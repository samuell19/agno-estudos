It's okay. [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] [KISSES] It's okay. It's okay. We're here now. Oh, it's gonna be okay. [SNIFFLES] It's gonna be okay. [PANTING] - MIA: God, this place is beautiful. - LUCAS: Mmm. - MIA: It's a miracle. - LUCAS: It's incredible. MIA: Mmm. How is there soda here? JENN: There was a family here a long time ago, and they left a bunch of stuff. LUCAS: Mmm. - MIA: Mmm. - [EXHALES] [LUCAS PANTING] [EXHALES] So, whenever you guys are ready... we should get out of here. Uh, back on the raft? It isn't safe here. There's... an animal... Sweetheart, I'm sure there's a lot of animals. It's a monster. Okay, I saw it. It crawled out of the ocean and it walks on land, and it drags its food back out to this... There's a... There's a black hole out there. Okay? Zack washed up. He was already dead, and I saw it drag him out there. Okay. The family that I was telling you about... Look at this. - What is this? - Do you see that? [STAMMERS] Those are his eyes. - It killed them. - How could you know that? Because I found their graves. They were buried here. Well, then what happened to the person who dug the graves? [SIGHS] Now... Okay. Well, there's clearly a current pulling things towards the island. All right? We all washed up here. I say we wait, we'll see if anyone else arrives. Same. What if Brad shows up? Brad's dead. [EXHALES] Brad's dead? Yeah. Oh, fuck... I'm sorry, I... [JENN SIGHS] What happened to him? Okay, I buried him. I buried him deep into the ground and this creature came and dug him up. What does this thing look like? [STAMMERS] It's massive. It has two sets of eyes, and it smells. Look, I got it last night. Okay? That's black blood. [SNIFFLES] Was he... Was he in pain? Mia, he knew that he wasn't alone. He knew that I was there with him. MIA: You still love that sound? I guess everyone does. [SIGHS] Don't think I'll be coming to the beach much after this. You know, out on the raft, for the first time in my life, I thought I was gonna die. I really thought that... that that was it. And it's funny because all I was thinking about is how embarrassing it would be. Everyone back home's just waiting for me to fail. Out on the raft, you don't hear waves. You don't hear anything. I'd rather die on the raft than this place. You don't know what it's like out there. So, we're gonna head west. I saw a bunch of planes go that way. I'm pretty sure they'll see us. Okay, hey. - I know this all sounds crazy. - Yeah. I really need you to believe me. I do. It's just a lot to process, all right? I mean, we just need a little bit of time, okay? I'm gonna get more food. We should bring as much as we can. Can I borrow this? Thanks. Hey, make sure she gets ready. Okay, there's enough for a week. - We got to be smart with what we've. - [MIA SIGHS] - All right, let's load up the raft. - LUCAS: Jenn. We're not leaving. - What? - Not right now. - Not in our condition. - We can't do it. I understand that you're tired. Guys, I'm tired, too. I'm exhausted, but... We're not just tired. We're weak. All right, we've barely eaten. - Just need to rest up, all right? - No, you don't rest here. Jenn, you've been alone and you're scared, and I get that. But whatever you've been seeing, this animal-- - It's not an animal! I told you that! - Hey, okay, listen to me, there's nothing for miles, Jenn. Okay? I say we light a huge fire. You said there are planes, right? We'll light a fire and they'll see us. [SIGHS] It's getting dark. Get ready to leave. Sweetheart, are you even listening to me? We are not getting on that fucking raft! [STAMMERS] Just not tonight, all right? We'll figure this out. JENN: Okay. [PANTING SOFTLY] Lucas. LUCAS: Hey! Jenn! Hey! Stop it! Stop! Jenn! Wait! Hey! Stop! - Get off me! - Calm down. - Let go of me! - Stop! - Stop! - I'm leaving! - [SCREAMING] - Stop. Just stop. No! [MIA YELPS] LUCAS: Hey! Hey. - I'm leaving, I don't care! - Calm down! I don't care! No! Stop! [GRUNTS] [GROANS] - [WHIMPERS] - Hey. Shh. It's okay. Where is Lucas? He's just taking a look around. Don't worry, it's been dark for a few hours, and we haven't seen anything. You had to tie me up? I think just for now. I'm sorry. Really, I... I shouldn't have hit you like that. I just... I didn't know what else to do. Mia, I don't care. Just... untie me. I think we've all been through something traumatic, and we're all just trying to cope with it in our own different ways. I'm just as guilty, - I am. - Guilty? Who's guilty? I didn't make this up. I'm not lying to you. Right. Like when you got mugged before we left. Jenn, it's not that I don't believe you. It's just that, over the years, you've made it pretty hard for me to believe you. [EXHALES] This is a little different. I just want what's best for everyone. I really don't need you to tell me what's best for me. [SCOFFS] [BRANCH SNAPS] LUCAS: I didn't see anything. There's nothing out there. 'Cause it doesn't come from the trees. I just want you to feel safe. MIA: We're all just trying to figure this out. Figure it out? - Yes, figure it out. - We need to get away from this place as soon as possible. Do you want me to give you guys a second? - Okay. - Thank you. [FOOTFALLS DEPARTING] She's really sorry about what happened-- Yeah, she mentioned it. Lucas, untie me. Not until you promise me you'll relax. You all right? I just want to make sure that you're okay. You're fine. There's always a black cloud hanging over your head. You know that, right? This whole thing, Jenn. It's so crazy. I was having a great time all week. On a boat with my friends, weather was perfect. Brought you on this incredible trip. Everyone's having a great time, except you, right? And the night you come up to tell me that you might not be happy, that you maybe don't want to be in this... storm clouds roll in. How perfect is that? No matter where you go, there's always a storm right behind you. Lucas, you know I love you, but this is not the time to talk about this. Let me go. So, what were you gonna do? - What was your plan, exactly? - I told you. - Head west. - No, I get that. But you head west, you get found and brought back home. And then what? You've got no one else. Where you gonna live? You gonna go back to school? And afford it how? I pay for your life. And you pay me back by taking the raft and leaving me here to starve to death? You don't starve here. That's not what happens. You get torn into pieces and dragged into a hole in the middle of the ocean. That's what happens here. Mia thinks you're starting to sound a lot like Zack. What happened to Zack? - [MIA SCREAMS] - [GROWLING] [MIA SCREAMING] Lucas. Shit. Lucas! - [SCREAMING] - [GROWLING] - [GRUNTS] - [GROWLS] - [ROARS] - [GRUNTS] [GROWLS] [COUGHING] [STRAINING] [STRAINING] [GURGLING] [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] Run. Now. [GRUNTS SOFTLY] LUCAS: Are you sure? I've never seen it during the day. [SIGHS] There's nothing you could have done. [SNIFFLES] [KEYS JANGLE] Give me a hand? I'm gonna see if there's anything else we might need from the old campsite. [PILLS RATTLING] [SIGHS] [BOTH PANTING] JENN: All right. Climb in. [GRUNTS] [PANTING] Shit! - [SCREAMS] - It grabbed me. Help me! Shit! - [SCREAMS] - [WHIMPERS] Ahh! [SCRAPING] [SCRAPING STOPS] [BOTH PANTING] You said it wouldn't come out during the-- [SCREAMS] [GASPS] [BOTH SCREAM] [WHIMPERS] [CREATURE GROWLING] [SCREECHES] - [GROWLING] - [BOTH COUGHING] [FLARE GUN FIRES] [SCREECHING] - [SCREAMS, GASPS] - [COUGHING] [PANTING] [SCREAMS] [MUFFLED SCREAMING] [CHITTERING] [INAUDIBLE] [MUFFLED GROWLING] [INAUDIBLE] [PANTING] [SCREAMS] [CRYING] [COUGHS] [PANTING] [BLOWING] [PANTING] JENN: I'm writing this letter hoping it serves as some sort of proof. A little more than a week ago, my boat went down in a storm, and I've been surviving on this island since. Zack and Brad from our group are both dead. Brad washed ashore with me already injured and died shortly after. Days later, Zack washed ashore, already dead. I never knew their last names. Shit. Mia Reed and my boyfriend, Lucas Griffin, arrived on a raft a few days after. And they were both killed by a monster that lives just off this island. And there's nothing I can do to prove that. For a lot of my life, I've struggled with being believed. The truth doesn't always come with a receipt. Sometimes all we've is our word. [GRUNTING] There's no way for me to show you the things that I can tell you. That there's a monster here taller than any man I've ever seen, twice as fast in water as it is on land, and it bleeds black blood. For a week I've run from it and hid from it, but not anymore. If you find this note, what's left of my body will either be on this island or deep in a hole off the west shore. I hope this letter is enough for you to believe my story. [PANTING] Jennifer Remming.
