Chief Frank was saying we might get avalanche conditions later on. - Avalanche? Isn't that a little dangerous? - Well yeah, it can mush your hair a little. - [Chief] What do you think John? - It looked okay to me, but Frank's the expert. I just fly the mountains. - Could be tricky, if the overhang start moving. - I appreciate your concern Chief, but we're on a very tight schedule here. Your own man has just said it's gonna be okay. What can happen? We're here for the day, right? - Okay, and John here is gonna be your guide.

Doesn't it? - Give me this. - Where's that CB set that John was talking about? - Right here.

I catch cold easy. - We got the car stupid. - Good fun for Eskimos. (woman giggling) (slow paced music) - You don't kid around do you? - You want to take me to the movies first? - There. - Come on. Nothing. I mean I don't know if we're blocked by the mountain, but I can't get a damn thing. - Well they wouldn't leave us equipment that wouldn't work. - There's no telling what people will do. Maybe if I had a look at it. - Ah Jesus Christ! I just want off of this mountain. (snow rumbling) Shit! Jesus Christ, what was that! - Holy shit! Shut up you stupid bitch! - What are we gonna do! - [Woman] Oh my God! - What? - Mary and Pete! - What about them? - They went out to the car! - They could be buried out there! - Shovel!

I mean those guys down there know that we're up here. They know more about what's going on than we do. I mean they'll come and get us. So how about getting together some music? - What am I, a DJ? - Okay okay. Don't get touchy. - Feeling better? - [Mary] Oh great. You know, you ought to try it. Snow and the naked body is so stimulating. - Don't you think you ought to put on some clothes? - [Pete] I think she looks great. She is. (rock music) - Come on Susie, lighten up huh. - Lighten up? - [Bob] Yeah. - You moron. You drag us up a mountain, practically get us all killed, and then throw a party? - How am I supposed to know that the weather's gonna close down huh? You're brilliant fly boyfriend didn't know about it. - Yeah, well at least he had sense enough to get off this fucking mountain! - Oh, so you struck out with the star. Want to try with the hired help? - Yeah, we can arrange that. - Great. - Hey Bob. I checked out the camera. It's okay as far as I can see. - Great, I'll check it later. - Hey Bob, there's something on the tape I think you ought to look at. - Later okay. Come on. - If you feel like it. Thanks. - Come and get it. - What's that? - Everything I could find just tossed in a pot. - Wanna see? There's something really big coming fast at the camera. I can't tell what it is. - Hmm, it's difficult to make anything out through here. Is this all you got to view it on? - Yeah, it's all we got up here. We'll have to wait till we get back to the studio to see it on anything bigger. - Well I'm sorry, but I can't make anything out at all. - The trouble with all you sound guys is you're all blind. - At least I've got ears. - Huh? - [Male Band Member] That is too much. - [Male Band Member] I told you, I told you! - I'll try and get some of those avalanche sounds on tape. - Okay. - [Woman] You gonna eat or what? - Would you keep some of it hot for me? - [Woman] Why? Where are you going? - I want to try and get a clean recording of the avalanche sounds. - Dave, you're not going out there. - Well only far enough to lose the party noise. - [Woman] Okay, but why not eat first? - Food can wait. I'd like to get out there now. Hey Nick, check you later. - Hey, stay on top of the snow okay? - I'll do my best. - [Nick] Okay. - [Woman] Don't be long eh.

Okay? - [Bob] Yeah. - [Nick] See it? - [Bob] What is it? - A big damn heavy girder. A thing like that doesn't just up and throw itself, it passes by. - [Bob] So, what are you saying? - There's something or somebody up there that doesn't want us around.

I'd like to get the CB working again. Where's Dave? - Oh, Dave went out some time ago. Kerry just went out to look for him. - Ooh. I remember Dave saying how he thought the CB might be blocked by the mountain. Well why don't you and I go outside and try it there? - [Nick] Yep. - Bob, for Christ's sake, you're frightening me to death. What is it? - It's probably nothing. I want you to stay here. We're gonna go and try and raise the valley from outside. Are you okay Nick? - [Nick] Yep. - And you definitely heard the words movie unit? Yeah. Okay. I got it. John! A trucker on the high Valley Road picked up a weak CB signal. A lot of static, but he thinks he heard the words "movie unit." And we're in big trouble. - Yeah, well it's worse than that. I was just talking to Frank's wife, she hasn't heard from him since this morning. - Dave's gone! - [Woman Entering] What you mean gone? Gone where? - I found his tape machine! - Where? - By the factory! He, he could be lying there hurt or anything! - Hey listen, he'll be okay. - Then why did he leave his tape machine? - Anything on it? - Where's Bob? - They went out to try and get that CB working. ♪ We go rocking tonight ♪ ♪ We go rocking tonight ♪ (snow crunching) - [Male Band Member] What the hell is that? - [Chief] What can we do? - Well, no chance of getting the chopper in.

What's going on? - Kerry went to look for Dave and all she found was his recorder lying in the factory. - [Bob] What? (Dave screams) - Listen. (Dave groaning) God, what's happening? What is it? - What what do you think? - Dave wouldn't just leave his tape recorder lying around. He's in trouble. - We ought to all stick together. - [Woman] Then let's go look for him all together. - No, I want you to stay here. I want you to keep trying with this thing for all the good it'll do. I think maybe somebody ought to stay with you. Sarah, Louise, Linda!
