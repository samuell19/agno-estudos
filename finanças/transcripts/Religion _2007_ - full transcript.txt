Nice. Greetings, Pandit. Welcome. (Chanting) oh, Pandit-Ji! Hey, Pandit-Ji. - Greetings, Pandit-Ji. - You are late, Pandit-Ji. The prayers are long over. l returned late at night after my prayers. My three year old child did kept on crying all night. He has been sick since many days. He has diarrhea. l fell asleep during all this and didn`t even know when day came out. The morning must not have been as you expected, Daya Shankar. lt is the duty of every Brahman to worship the sun lord every morning. And these prayers must not be for show. Customers come everyday but not god. Shiv, Shiv, Shiv. lt was a mistake! l did not see. - You touched Pandit Chaktervedi! - lt was a mistake. l did not look. l made a mistake. Please forgive me. He has dirtied the pandit! Beat him! Punish him! Why are you beating him? Enough! That is enough! What`s going on? He is a Brahman. Lord Brahma personally gave us this most superior caste. - And `shudh`? - Untouchable. He knows it that not even his shadow should fall on us. And he touched pandit Chaktervedi! So Pandit-Ji has to purify himself? Greetings, Pandit-Ji. Those people were beating that poor guy for your sake, but you said nothing? What can Pandit-Ji do? lt was that lowlife`s mistake who unpurified Pandit-Ji`s religion. only Allah is supreme ad we all are his men. Everyone was created with the same light. Nobody is better or worse. That is what our scriptures say too. Amazing! You are teaching scriptures to the pandit? Since you are so proud of your education, compete with the pandit. Be at peace. l have obeyed our scriptures according to Maha Dev`s teachings. Parnaam. (Hindi greeting) You believe in what is written on paper, l believe in what the eye sees. Maha Dev. - Greetings, pandit. - Maha Dev. l have made some `laddus`. Please bless them. - l will send them to your house. - Do that. My daughter will pay you. - Pandit-Ji, what was the meaning of... - the monk`s words? Just knowing the scriptures is not enough. You have to live it to be successful. - Maha Dev, Pandit-Ji. - Maha Dev. The bazaar is full of such wandering monks. lf you want to really understand our religion, then you must only pay attention to pandit-Ji`s teachings. Understand, Mr. Paul? - Greetings, Pandit-Ji. - Maha Dev. Arguing will not change our thinking, Guru lshnath. We don`t want to get involved in any trouble. Paul, after one hour, son. Maha Dev. - Go carefully. - Yes. And don`t take any edibles from anyone. Today riots started in Gadoi. Forty people of one group were killed. Many houses were burnt down. Bau-Ji, how did these Hindu Muslim clashes suddenly start? Suddenly? History is full of such clashes. one strikes up a spark, the other starts fire. A father leaves the son, a husband leaves a wife, in-laws and brothers do the same with each other. But Mr. Ganga, mother Ganges does not wait for anyone. lf he had bathed even once in her waters, she washes all her sins and makes him pure. ln this bad world where people live together, the presence of mother Ganges amongst us is a blessing. - Greetings. - Greetings. The rest of your students are late or have we complete our tasks quicker? You must not forget, Parwati, that when l go for prayers at Vishnu Singh`s, you will have to teach the students. Today is a good day for asking the sun lord for his blessings. lt doesn`t look like he is Vishnu`s child. He is so hot tempered that l wonder how we can instill tolerance in him. This will take a long time. Yes, may be even several lives. l was referring to the prayers. That is a totally different matter. Then you will not have your meal before afternoon. l am a Brahman. Let me feed my soul first. The food for the body can be taken later too. You go ahead and have your meal. The doctor has said it is important for you to eat at the right time. lf you know what is important for your soul, then l am also aware of mine. l will wait for you. You neither have the energy to fast nor the knowledge. l know, but l can still observe that one day of fasting of which you have no knowledge. Pati-vardh. Pandit-Ji, l read somewhere that a woman`s pati-vardh dharm (fast for husbands) says that she must obey all of her husband`s wishes. Not somewhere, it`s written in the Manusvriti, in the chapter Nokishlok 154-55. Husband is god for married woman. Very good, child. - Greetings, pandit-Ji. - Maha Dev. Paul. A woman without husband has no status in society. - Greetings, Pandit-Ji. - Maha Dev. Come. Which topic is under discussion with Pandit-Ji these days? - A very... - Complex conversation on a woman`s pati-vardh dharm. - l see, l see. lt must be some good you did in the previous life that you got to cross the 7 seas and are being blessed with the Pandit`s knowledge of dharm. This is what is necessary for being a good man. You will elucidate? Quiet! You don`t interfere, Parbha. l said she won`t go, so she won`t go. Talking rubbish! - But she has her studies... - Don`t advocate for her. Keep quiet. - Quiet. Absolutely quiet. - Pandit-Ji. ls it necessary for us to stay inside our homes? Bau-Ji gave me permission for M.A. with great difficulty. Today is the last date and Suriya bhayya (brother) is saying... You have studied enough! There are rituals to be performed in the house and she wants to go study! - Suriya Parkash. - You stay quiet, Babu-Ji. Girls forget their customs Just because of too much education. - Education! - Customs. ln our culture nobody talks like this, Suriya Parkash. Especially not with our fathers. And as far as Manayi is concerned, she has nothing to do with these rituals. Mr. Vishnu Singh may command as he deems necessary. - You go, daughter. - Yes. Parbha will look after the arrangements of the rituals. Then you do the rituals yourself. Stop, Parbha. These rituals will be performed, son. And you will perform them. l say the Pandit-Ji is to blame for it. When the elder brother is forbidding it why is he interfering in between? He thinks himself as a god, that`s why. And Babu-Ji, for these stupid Banarsis! ls there any sense? Who is he to teach people the ideals of life? You also want to do the same, don`t you? Don`t l know that? You are greedy for Pandit Chaktervedi`s Job and daughter both. Welcome gentlemen. Come, pray. Peace for father, grandfather or dead. What greed? Pandit Chaktervedi is the greatest pandit of his order. - But am l lesser than him in knowledge? - Greetings, Dhanak-Ji. Welcome, madam. Ganga, you are missing. Come sit, sit. Now madam give some charity. Thank you. You are fortunate, brother. Touching foreigner ladies. l have to look after my family and home too, brother. Bau-Ji does not pay for my living like Pandit-Ji. You are not our temple`s great worshipper either. Become a devoted worshipper. l will pick you and show you. You are very cute. - Very beautiful. - He is Ganga`s son? What happened? A poor woman was thirsty. She handed her the child and went to drink water. - But she did not return. - What? You brought a stranger`s child home? How did you even touch him without knowing his caste? He is a Brahman`s child. Vivika has asked her. Still, you should not have brought him home. His mother must be worrying. Go wait for her. lt has been four hours but she has not returned. l pray everything is all right. You did tell her that you are Pandit-Ji`s daughter, didn`t you? Then she will easily get here. You start praying. l have made all the arrangements. Go, entertain him there. You plan on having dinner in the afternoon? You carry on. l will leave after warming up milk for the child. He will wake up hungry. He will create disturbance in Vivika`s studies. He has already come in between you and the Lord. What if he was our son? Besides, God does not follow human`s clocks. He knows everything. God is all knowing. What did you do, silly? Maa, he pissed on my uniform! oh! l will press another one. Till then take a bath. He will have eaten our heads by the time prayers are over. We must get ready before your father returns And this RaJa brother of yours is making us even more late. - Vivika. - Yes? - Pick him up, child. - l am going for a bath, Ma, or l will get late. - okay. l will pick him up after arranging the prayer tray. That`s it. You break your fast, l will be right there with the tray. You have been blinded by the motherhood of a baby! l will have to take a bath again. Did you give him a bath again or not? - Ma, l am leaving. - l am preparing breakfast. Ma, l have already drank curd. He was screaming so much. l figured Manayi would come and take care of it. But Manayi did not come either. l should have had made roti. Ma, you take care of RaJa bhayya. l can look after myself. And tomorrow l will get up early and help you too. There will be no need for it. lf his mother does not come by tomorrow, then l will talk to lnspector Sharma and arrange something for him. Good thing you came, daughter. - Greetings, Pandit-Ji. - Maha Dev. Wash your hands and fix me some breakfast. Yes. otherwise l will have to drink sattu. - Greetings. - Greetings. We have to lick his feet to give knowledge to the English? Pandit-Ji has arrived. You will take photographs? l am marrying off my daughter, Vishnu Singh-Ji. According to religion, the father has the duty to marry off his daughter. Let me tell you that. obeying all seven of these, indeed marry your daughter off. And it is the duty of the daughter to support her father completely in this. Did you understand what Pandit-Ji has said? - Maha Dev. - And understand what l say too. You will not leave the house after today. lf you do, then we will sink you with that foreigner too. Understand? This traced back to New York. Had anything happened, Suriya Parkash could not have been bailed out. Did you find out about the child`s mother, Mr. Sharma? l checked with the police control room. But there has been no report filed in the whole district for any missing child. So can nothing be found out about the child`s mother? We can inquire in nearby districts. But that will take time, Pandit-Ji. A week. one who has not filed a report yet won`t come. She has disowned the child. You yourself say that everything happens for a reason. Then god has given us this child for some reason. Until the time the inspector finds out about his mother, can we keep the child? - lmprove yourself. - Yes, Bau-Ji. Vivika? Come here, child. What play was shown on your television today? We couldn`t go to Gaitri`s house to watch television due to RaJa bhayya. After all, at least some good came out of this child`s arrival in our house. Motherhood is there in girls even in childhood. l wish Vivika is married with a good looking man. Your wish is not important. Vivika will be married where God wants. God alone has control over making new relations. You drugged yourself to sleep? She ran away with the foreigner and you don`t even know it? l will kill you and both of them! And myself too! Have you gone mad? Keep it down! She has left me mad! Where will we go? How will we show our face? All this happened because of you and your Pandit Chaktervedi! Move! l have lost both my children, Pandit-Ji. What shall l do? What would you have done if it was your daughter? lf it had been my daughter even l would not have been able to do anything. A girl who falls in love she is responsible for herself. Forget about her. Just think that you did not have a sister at all. l say if Pandit Chaktervedi had not entertained Paul, then you would not have faced this problem at all. Hey! You dare to stomp the flowers for prayers? You lowlife! You mock our religion? l will end you right now! Why are you beating him? He stepped on holy flowers. Stop. Cool down. Ending one will not achieve anything, Suriya Parkash. We will have to unite to tackle this problem. United. You understand what l am saying? To protect our religious beliefs, we have the right to end the opposition to our religion. This is our duty and this is in our teachings too. our religion is the greatest and most violent. Today foreigners are attacking our religion. The path you are following, is the same path due to which our religion will blossom. Today let us swear that this is how we will serve our religion by any means necessary. Do you swear? Yes! Yes! What happened, child? Quiet down. l will be right there. l am cooking food, Wait for a while. Quiet down, child. l am Just coming. What happened? okay l am coming. Keep quiet. Please keep quiet. l am coming. l will come as soon as l clean the flour. lf l step out of the kitchen now, everything will be a mess. l will have to take a bath again. Quiet him down. Until l give you food, l cannot do anything else. - Shall l help you? - oh please do. Just shake his toy. He will calm down. No, you don`t need to touch him. There is no news of the child`s mother. lf you agree, why not send him off to a government orphanage? Sending him to a government orphanage is not advisable, Mr. Sharma. He is a Brahman`s offspring who has come to our house. There must be God`s wisdom behind it. l will tell the temple`s workers to come and take him with them tomorrow. We are not wise enough to understand lshwar`s (Hindus god) plans. Still, a thought comes to the mind. You have started thinking too? Don`t burden yourself. Bring out whatever thought has come to you. otherwise you will not be able to sleep the whole night. l was thinking that who else can better explain about dharm and scriptures? Who knows lshwar wants this child to be taught and trained about dharm by you. Just like you would have done with your son. You are talking about adopting the child? lf his own mother comes, then? only the lucky get the love of more than one mother. Just like your Shiv-Ji`s son got. Kartikay! Parwati. Parwati. Why are you crying loudly? l have left my prayers. Now should l shake your toy? Quiet down. Bhayya must have had said to pick him up so Bau-Ji did so. Keep quiet. He is sleeping. Bau-Ji, l have come. Kartik! Kartik look! Hush! Babu-Ji is praying. Babu-Ji, more! Ma! Bau-Ji! Bau-Ji! Hello. l will stand here till you come out so your house remains clean. Money? Send it to my other address. okay? Good day. - oh sorry. lt is good night. - Hey, brother. How are you? - The call was from America. - Pandit-Ji has come. Greetings, Pandit-Ji. Maha Dev. lt was from America. our pandit has settled over there, Daya Shankar-Ji. A Brahman by birth, Vesh by actions. What is bad in it? one should change with time. Truth does not change with time. And faith is the greatest truth. lf possible try to understand it, Daya Shankar. - Bau-Ji! - Coming, child. - Greetings. - Come, Daya Shankar-Ji. l am fine here. Greetings, Pandit-Ji. Maha Dev. l say, that child which some child had given to Vivika on the road, whom PanditJi calls son and you as Kartikya, his mother has come to take him. She says she had fled from riots from a distant village. But collapsed on the river bank due to thirst. People admitted her into a government hospital. Kartikya`s mother lost her senses on losing her child. Where is Kartikya`s mother? You can meet her right now. Her quest to locate you led to us at the river bank yesterday. Come. Please come. You cannot enter Pandit Chaktervedi`s house. Come. Come. The cow goes where the calf is. Namaste. My name is Nafeesa. l run the Dawar Mohsinat lnstitute in Madanpura. And this is Surayya. Mustafa is her son. May God bless you for giving refuge to her child in your home. How can this be? Actually, the child was very young. - He was not even circumcised. - You brought a stranger`s child? - When riots started... - How did you even touch him without knowing his caste? - The kid is a Brahman. We fled from there. l met her in the government hospital. She was not in her senses at all. She took a long time before she could even talk properly. And after that the trips to the police station. Then we met lnspector Sharma at the station. We were coming searching for you only when we met Daya Shankar-Ji. Vivika. Vivika! Manayi! Manayi! Ma! No, Ma! No, Ma! Ma no! Ma don`t let him go! - Ma! - Didi (sister)! - Don`t let him go! - Didi! Didi! Didi! - Take him away. - Bau-Ji! Ma! Bau-Ji! Bau-Ji! l don`t want to go! Bau-Ji! Bau-Ji! Bau-Ji! No! l don`t want to go! Ma! Bau-Ji! Bau-Ji! l don`t want any explanation. l will not blame my sins on anyone else. You could not keep control on yourself. But l can. For this sin, l vow to fast to pay. Maha Dev. Taoo-Ji (Taoo-Ji=Father/Grand Uncle) Taoo-Ji... Taoo-Ji... Taoo-Ji... Taoo-Ji... Taoo-Ji... Taoo-Ji... Taoo-Ji... You already bare the punishment, Pandit-Ji. god knows, that isn`t your mistake. You didn`t know about the truth. Don`t break your fastening if you want so but take over the management of the temple again. Rulee has been dropped, Bau-Ji. l say, cleverness of the Pandit-Ji has no use for him. He has been destroyed by his own hands. Entrapped baldy... That child has touched everything from bell to the head of Begawan. According to scriptures, he has been destroyed. But the management of his temple... Why do you need this Job? You are already rich. l`m not worried about the Job, Bhai. (Bhai=Brother/Friend). only that person who is perfect in mental, physical and social values must be the head of the temple. And Pandit Chaktervedi has already contaminated. Are you in your senses? Pandit Chaktervedi has paid the price for both things. - By the way. -He has to be dismissed. Not in our life. Your this decision is wrong like always. You take the government and money... Because of you l`m bearing Pandit Chaktervadi till now. - But not now. - Then what will you do? Will you forcefully remove him? For the businessman Daya Shankar? Businessman. That businessman is much more capable from him. lf you`ll not agree Bau-Ji then we`ll remove him with our party strength. The decision has to be made today, Suriah Parakash. You have Daya Shankar and Guruish Nath... ...and the strength of your party. And Pandit Chaktervadi have his religion. l warn all of you. By gaining the trust of whole city you prove the Pandit Chaktervadi a culprit and guilty. then we are moving along with Pandit-Ji for 10 generations. will prove the relation of master and pupil. Absarodh says, l haven`t pure my heart and thinking. All chances for forgiveness has been gone. are in shadows. God give me the strength to fight. Such a strength, which gives me the faith to walk on the right way of religion. MAHADEV (MAHADEV=Lord). Maa, Bau-Ji break his fastening, Maa. (Maa=Mother)(Bau-Ji=Father) The Dark night has passed. and l announce proudly that l`ll fight. Greetings. Where is Pandit-Ji? He can`t talk with you right now. Why? He`s unable to speak so he take another fastening, isn`t he? He`s in prayers. and take the decision for the complete forgiveness. Fastening... Now what fastening he would do. Don`t know. Chander is here. Chanderrayen Fastening. Will Pandit-Ji take the Chandarayan fastening? What kind of fastening is this? Chandarayan fastening is the most difficult fastening written in the scriptures. After taking the oath, take the first step towards death, 2 steps away from life, like that counting one by one have to complete 15 steps till Purnima. after the completion have to reduce the steps one by one. Artha mentioned 15th and, Parithivadha 14th, Martihya 13th written that to close to death while stepping ahead and stepping down is known to be Chandarayan fastening. During this nothing is allowed in this fastening. Lord with your blessing the fastening of Chandernayan has ended today. lf there is any sin in my heart or body... then l throw it in the pure fire. Give me such a strength Lord that l walk on the right path of religion. Forgive me. l don`t know that l was doing such a big sin. Now l`ll never divert from the path of religion. l`m forgiving you. l also pray from body, heat and soul... Wish that Lord will forgive me. Just giving... - Greetings. - Greetings. Give it... Greetings Pandit-Ji. Hurry up Radhika. Now the prayers has ended, Maa. Hasn`t it? Yes... Ended... The Clash between two groups turn into riots in Seewa Puri near Banaras. Government already evaluate the situation that`s why security arrangements has been made. But the crowd was to massive to be controlled. The motives are still a mystery that how suddenly these clash turns into riots. Authorities claims soon they have to control the situation. Many incidents of fire, stoning and theft had happened in the vicinity. Many people has been inJured. lnJured are not even getting the first aid. Many people died as per the information. Many people have burnt so badly that it`s hard to recognize them. A foreign Journalist Paul Gordon is along with dead. Paul was writing a book on Hindu religion. What are you doing here, Kamadum. You are a Journalist we are going to dugout you Journalism. l`m Journalist. l`m Journalist. We all are agreed with Surayah Parkash, Beepu Singh-Ji. Manayi can`t stay in this home. lf she doesn`t stay here then where she go? - Who else? - You have to stay quite. Everything has happened because of your stubbornness. Now relatives are also blaming. then forbid the relation, She`s our daughter. We`ll not drown her in the Ganga Maiyan (Ganga Maiyan=River Ganga). Let Pandit Chaktervadi come and will have to listen his opinion. He`ll say the same. This is the live situation, Vishnu Singh-Ji. This is true. ...that Manayi left this home with her own decision. To be a widow father, in this live situation... ...it`s you moral duty according to the scriptures. That you made arrangements for her living, clothing, food and shelter. The Sewah Puri riots fires spread along whole Banaras. Due to the turmoil full with desire of revenge, the atmosphere has been terrorized. Curfew has imposed on Maqbool Alam Road and surroundings to prevent the further worse situation. Tension surrounds this city completely. Maa. Maa where is Kanti, Maa? Greetings Behan-Ji.

Women, children or old whoever infidel came in front him, were on his sword tip. our brothers and religion are killed by the hands of the infidels. - Greetings Pandit-Ji. - We`ll do the wonder tonight. lnfidels will face the fruit of there acts. Not a single infidel will stay alive with the mercy of Lord. Pandit-Ji. Pandit-Ji, today is such a lucky day. Today you are going to offer peace prayers and Shanti Parakash-Ji is going to fulfill umbrella of his religion today. l say, now it`s time for everybody to fulfill his duties for his faith. lt`s not good to forbid yourself.
