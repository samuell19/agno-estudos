You know how it's done. See? Where did you steal it? It's mine. Enough. First the escapes, and now stealing? - I didn't steal it. - You didn't report it at admission. Call my old orphanage. I'll call whoever I want. Please, believe me! Do it again and you'll be punished. Okay. - Who's got cigs? - I'm out. I'll give it back. Fuck! Watch it! Now what? How will you see your mom now? - You snitched on me! - So? Easy, the director's still here. Ola, dear… You have to learn the rules. They're here, at the gate. - The police? - Yes. Send them here, to the detention center. All right. Show me your pass. Go. No more than one spoon! - I don't like eggs. - Boo fucking hoo. Is something wrong? Better fix it. - You won't get a new one. - Train us, Tommy! Girls, stop it. Jealous of your husband, Ms Iza? Don't call me Tommy! Are we training? We're talented, too! I'll time you. Ready? Go inside, girls. I'd tap that. Knees up! - On one! - Go, go, go! Good job! Yes, it's my mother. She's barely here. I take care of her myself. Hey! Thank you. Bye. Ms Hanna? - I'll make rompers for Amelka. - It's too early. Easy, keep trying. Keep trying. - You keep trying. - What? Give me that. - Give me the scissors. - Okay. Ola to the director. You can go. The machine! Clear your station. What have you done? See what you've done? Is that so hard? You ruined the director's dress. I'll get her. Yes. You weren't lying. I'm glad. You look just like your mother. You know the rules. You can't have it here. - It's broken, it can't film. - I know. You can have it for an hour a day. Stay here till the end of class. Here. Run fast! Like mommy! You fucking kicked the dog? I'm not giving you any more. Girls! Miss Wet T-shirt! Stop splashing, girls, or you'll get in trouble. - Good morning! - Girls! Ms Iza. Mop it up. What are you waiting for? Get to it. Ola, Sandra, clean the corridor. - I like my spot! - Let's go. Look, girls! Fresh meat! Way to talk about yourselves. Way to go. - Morning. - Morning. - New one? - That's right. - Go. - Make an effort, girls. - You look horrible! - A run-away, from the station. - Those girls know what to do. - Enough. She made waves in her last juvie. - She might have lice. - Get her to the doctor. - We need a signature! - Of course. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. I've had enough. Got any clean underwear? It hurt so bad. He pushed it in. I didn't want to. I didn't want to do it. From the DA's office. Agnes, she's charged with murder. Other girls are afraid of her. - Are you listening? - I am. - That was rape! - I don't care, I'm just doing my job. Kid, you did it! The 6th best time in Poland. - Great. - You're in. I started a club for you. ''Tola.'' T for Tomek, plus Ola. Cool. Now it's your turn. It's 5 months till the championships. Congratulations. Good job. Will my mom know? - You need new shoes. - Just asking. It's your big chance. You can make the Olympic team. Get a scholarship, a boarding house, a life. - And a tracksuit. - I know. But mom? Keep training. She'll find you. Keep training. Tomek! What are you talking about? She believes you. It's not a big deal. Bye. Ready? And... Go! - I told him I want an iPhone. - And? And he bought it. He's not getting any for free. Can I borrow it? I'll give you cigs. - If you have to. - Really? Awesome! Eavesdropping, are you? So? Fuck off. - You're doing the coach for free? - You know nothing's free. Leave me alone. Maybe you're a virgin. Have you been fucked? Go see the therapist, second floor. Now imagine your families. It's dinnertime, everyone's at the table. Mom, dad, grandpa, grandma. A perfect dinner. Or just a nice one. There was only one man in my childhood home. - In the cellar. - Move away, pregs. - In the cellar? - Sure. Rats like cellars. Kasia! Go back to your seat. My name is Joasia. I'm sorry. Can you sit down? I had a rat. It lived in a cellar, I fed it. Did your mom make up her mind? No. But when she sees Amelka, she'll take her. I won't give her away. Stop making me do it! What about you? Mania, right? What's your home like? I had my mom and my brother. Her mom fucking killed her dad. - Don't use the f-word. - Or what? Mania is speaking now. She fucking did. - The new one gets it. - Quiet! Mania? When he was drunk, he called my mom a whore. And that I'm a whore. But she isn't. When he wasn't too drunk, he was nice. We had lots of pictures of the Pope. Dad was a fireman. He always worked as protection at all the church events. Protection? You mean security? Right. He always cried when he heard church hymns. Fuck my life, one fucking daddy! Sandra! What should I say? I don't know, just shut up. Come back, please. Come back. Thanks. What was your house like, Agnes? Mother and father. Feeding my sister. She's still a baby. What about you? I'm not. Are you with them? How about now? Now I eat here. And when you visit? I haven't yet. You've been here six months. Did you tell your mom what happened? I saw the video. You're going to visit her now. Why don't you tell her about it? What about you, Ola? With my mom. At home we ate together. What did you talk about? Training. My mom was a runner. She ran 1500 meters. And won. That railroad whore? Agnes, don't speak like that. Ola! Ola! Diana, don't! Sit down, Sandra! You're dead! Calm down! - You're getting punished. - It wasn't me! No more passes. And no more running. Are you allowed to do that? You have a ban. You're incredible. I couldn't do that. Come here. You were just doing the laundry. Ola! What are you doing? I'm coming. Look. Nice, right? He sent it. This one too. - I hope he comes on time. - Why? - We're going his to parents'. - Wow. - Stop making a mess. - Leave it. All right, girls. Ready for your home visits? Since yesterday! - Can we open the window? - What for? - 'Cause it stinks. - Justyna! Like dirty undies! She is hoarding food again. That's your locker? Throw this away. We would eat it at home. Honey... Can we open that window? Just for 15 minutes. We have an assembly. The handle. The handle! - Got it? - Yeah. From my brother. Good shit. - It's 50. - You said 30. - Inflation. - I have 30. - Wait. Watch the door. What are you doing? Shut up. You bitch! It's your fault I'm not going home. Get used to it. - What's going on? - She fell. Sure. Wash the blood off with cold water. Well? What's going on here? You want to get solitary? Is that it? Quiet down, do you understand? Give me three big plates. - We'd rather head home. - It's a long way. - Have dinner. - Come here, girl. It's six hours to Olsztyn, and one more to Antonówek. Even more, we live outside Antonówek. Going back to Marlena. She escaped just after she got here. She's a tough case. What a shame. Her father died, then... We just brought her things back. We're no longer a foster family. - Is her case being tried in Olsztyn? - Of course. - Thank you. - Thanks. Ola. Take me with you. Ola. This is inappropriate. I used to live there. Near Olsztyn, with my mom. Near Antonówek. Go away, Ola. - Take me with you. - Go. I'm sorry for that. She is all alone. No father, her mother disappeared. The only thing she has in Olsztyn is her old orphanage. Is Ewa the only one? Is she the only one who does it with him? Anyone who wants can go. How was she today? Nice and calm. - Bitch. - No drugs, then. Wait till you beg me for cigs. How's your mother, Ms Hanna? Maybe I'll get some help for her. You won't get shit. I'll make you some tea. I'll give you more shifts, Ms Hanna. - Fuck, stop it! - Let go! Girls! I don't want to see this. I've had enough. He's so old. Will there be body builders? Get this scarf away from me! Fuck off! Girls! Calm down. - Have some manners. - Oh, ma'am. It's here! I know him. He's cool. Here. I used to live here. Did you... Did you really... When your mom... I mopped the floor. I had to. I didn't want my brother to see the blood. - What are you in for? - Escaping. - That's it? - And stealing. Escaping from home? From the orphanage. Why? To be with my mom. I have to see my brother. Hello. So, girls. Do you like it? You know how much time it takes to look like this? What's with you? You don't like it? Keep looking. Such nice guys. Let me go! Let go! There's no real track. Her shoes are bad. And I still got this much out of her. I'd love to work for your club. If she wins, I'll call you. Bye. What's up? - Can I put these away? - Sure. I was talking about you. You're good, keep training. I am. You wanna leave? Change is good. But first, the championships. You could use a win. Your camera. Okay. - Group one. - Finally. - Be back in an hour. - Can I? - Say the magic word. - Thanks. - I gotta call mom. - In a minute! Mr. Tomek... Your mom didn't buy you this phone. Got a problem with that? Wanna talk? My mom's dead, you know. Can I have mine? I can't call my brother later. It's dinnertime at his orphanage. - Thanks. - No problem. Hello? Can I speak to my brother? What did you do to yourself? Is my mom coming? She didn't call. Maybe on Saturday. You're not picking up. - Don't cry! - What have you been up to? - You're still here? - Can I borrow your phone? Stop calling your old orphanage. I don't want get into trouble. - Are you coming? - You gotta meet them... - Feet down. - You said that two weeks ago. I'm not calling that whore mother! You said the same thing two weeks ago. Don't do this to me. I don't wanna be alone. Do you have a cough? Come on, just tell me. You have money for that whore. Send me some, too. Promise to take her, mom. She can't be in an orphanage. I won't give her away. Where's Ola? Up your ass. Mania, get Ola. Kisses! Bye bye! Ola! Ola! Come here! Ola can stay with that couple from Olsztyn. When is she going? We're training. I don't know. Soon. You'll figure it out. - For you. - A tracksuit? I have a cousin your height. You'll look nice and decent. She has to go now? I convinced them. They'll take her. The court agreed. She didn't go on vacation. School is not a problem. All my work for nothing? I started a club! End of discussion! Don't worry. He doesn't bite. Quiet, Jack! It's us. Finally! Come in. - Hello. - Welcome. Take off your coat. The soup's almost ready. I'll show you your room. That's it. You can unpack later. Do you like it? It's very nice. Thank you. - Want some soup? - Yes, please. Thanks. Eat up. You can call us aunt and uncle. I'm the uncle. It's good. Eat up. Hello. Your new girl? - That's right. - Pretty, like my granddaughter. - The pants aren't ready. - If it's a problem... I just need a zipper. - Take it, for Zosia. - Thanks. You need a kid. The house won't feel empty. She's just here for a month. Autumn break. - I'm off to work. - Bye! See? He likes you. - How do you like it here? - A lot. It's like my grandma's house. Who lives there now? No one. My mom prefers the city. I'll show you something. Come in. Here. So sweet! You can pet it. Feed it. - Here. - You can do it every day. Follow me. You can run here. Great. - Uncle - Yes? - Would you take me to my orphanage? - What for? Don't tell me you miss it. They may know where my mom is. Ola... If she left you, she left you. She didn't. The police took me away. Next time I go to Olsztyn, I'll take you. Thanks. Who are you? Andrzej's girl? The new one? Where is the bus stop? Over there. Where are you going? Do they know? Oh, great! - Hello. - You escaped again? I… Come in. Be quiet, grandma's sleeping. - A family took me in for a while. - Shush. When she wakes up, she screams and howls. - Eat some soup. - My mom? - Do you know anything? - What... Will you ask around? I'll be here for a month. Eat up. Come back later. In a week. Do you like it? - It's your mom's recipe. - She added rice. She was quite a friend… I was never a good cook. But I could run. A little. Your mom was better. You have to go now. My man doesn't like strangers. And the cops are always onto you. You'll find her one day. You'll see. Let go! There it is! Good job. Now secure it. And keep pulling. Good first effort. And... Cast! - Oh no, I messed up. - You have to... You have to pull it up. Easy. Ready? Come here. Get a good swing. Now go! A good swing, I said! Ola... Put your back into it. That'll be 9.50. Thank you. - Hey. - Hi. What do you need? Auntie asked for butter, cheese, five buns and four beers. On her tab. I told her to pay first. - But... - No way. She never pays back. Maybe they will when they get child support. - Yeah, right. - Andrzej can't get a job. - So what? She sent the kid... - Not in front of the girl. Tell them to pay me back by the 1st. Or they won't get anything else. - Let go. - Not that again. - Stop it. - I said no! Always the same! You pig. - I'll find someone else. - Go ahead! But remember, it's all mine! Leave! I will leave. For good. Auntie? I brought groceries. I think it's all here. If not, I can go back. Should I unpack it? - Get your own dinner. - What about uncle? Can I feed the rabbits? Go ahead. Want some? Careful! I'll be fine. Uncle? Maybe we could... go to my orphanage tomorrow? You're a good girl. Uncle. Thanks. Stop it! Let me go! - Come on... - Stop it! That's what you came for, isn't it? You want it. Stop it! Shush! Quiet. Quiet. Like a slaughtered pig. Can I borrow your phone? - What happened? - Please... Please! Don't go too far. Hello? Miss, it's me, Ola. I'm near Olsztyn. Can I come and stay? Just till the end of the month. I didn't do anything. Please, just for a few days! It's my orphanage! Please... You got beat up? I'll call the cops, they'll help you. Hey! Wait! Stop it already. Who's going to believe you? Who? Believe you? Fuck. You'll get us in trouble. Ola! We'll go to the orphanage. Maybe you'll find your mom. I'll ask a neighbor for help. You can't do it on your own. Alright? Ola. Okay? Ola? What are you doing in there? You'll hurt yourself. I need... Don't lock the door. Hey, girls! - Hi. - I got you something. This is for you. Thanks. And that's for Ola. For running. Nice. Ola, come try it on! - Must have been expensive. - I got a job. And you two deserve it. Ola! Won't you try it on? You know what I want. Try it on, will you? I won't wait any longer. Take care of it. What? What? Give me that. Ola? - I brought candy. - Give it to them. Is the director in? You call out of the blue saying you want to visit? Was my mom looking for me? You were convicted. Remember? Go back to the juvie, or stay with that family. What about my mom? That again? Nothing changed since last year. I'll write to her last rehab. Maybe they know something. - I'll come back in a week. - It'll take at least a month! - Let's go home. - No. - So where? - Drive, I'll show you the way. - Ola? Why are you... - Do you know anything? Remember your mom's trainer? He saw her at the station. Sober. She was settling something in court. She's looking for me. Where is she? Maybe the trainer will find out. I know she is looking for me. Thank you. Give me a week. I have to go. That's your girl! Ola! Our neighbor here is a cop. He can help you find your mother. Talk to him. - Hi. - Hello. Did you find out anything? Not yet, but I'm trying. We lived here 10 years ago. I can give you her picture. Maybe someone knows something? It might help. I'll do my best. Thanks. Aren't you going to thank me? What are you doing? It's not soap, I won't use it up. Don't just stand there. Feed the dog. 302 to 010. All in order, we'll arrive on time. Thanks. Over and out. Want some? Maybe later? Why did you do it? Even the rabbits burned. No lice. - She's been cutting herself. - Oh Lord. Bruised. But not badly. Later, Agnes. Agnes! - I need the keys. - Right, they called. You'll go to jail, and that'll be it. I won't hear any more of this. You're lucky they sent you back here. For now. A week of solitary. Get dressed. Did you hear me? - Give it to me, please. - You know the rules. If my mom sends cake, I'll give you some. - Check it, it just came. - Anything for me? Nothing. Come inside, girls. Are you waiting for Tommy? I'm sorry you won't go to the championships. You'll get another chance. I have to go back. There. - Why? - I have to. Tell me what happened. I went into the shed... And... And... Was there penetration? You can't ask her that! - Ms Iza. - She can't! It's a questioning. She has to do it. - I've seen many girls like her. - And? Why didn't you report the first rape? My mom's friend was trying to find her. Will you talk to her? Will you talk to her? Talk to her, for fuck's sake! Ola is running! Good job! Keep it up! Ola! Wait! She didn't give up. I'm not sure she should compete. Can she handle it? She wants to. She has to run to win. And if she loses? I told you, she has to run. Mania! Come here. Good! Keep breathing! Keep the pace! - I can't keep up. - Come. I'm so happy she's running. It's great. Good work! Last lap. Good time. - You can still win. - Again. All right. Ready? Go! You won't be charged with arson. That fire... It was a cigarette stub. They... Both of them... We are trying to have them punished. Marlena was there before you. If he did that to her too... That woman. My mom's friend. Did she find out anything? No. But I contacted the court. We are trying to get them punished. I got this. I wrote to her, but she didn't answer. Szczecin? We don't know if that's her real address. - You should write to her. - I will. - What do you want? - Take it. You're running away. Did you sell your ass and got rich? You don't want this either? Where did you get it? The bitch didn't lock it up. Thanks. - I'll say I'll go running. - Wait. - There's a window. - Where? In the basement. - You know what? - What? My mom's coming to visit. Great. Let's go. - What are you doing? - None of your business. I have the key. You're not going? - Don't wanna piss off my mom. - I'm broke. - Thanks. - Watch out for the cops. I can't keep up! Stop running! Don't do that. You'll break our Christmas decorations. Hold it here, like that. Mom. It's me. Me who? Ola. I don't know you. Come on, daddy will be home soon. I really don't know you. Come on, hurry. Daddy will be back soon. Hurry up. I don't know you. Mom, open up! It's me! Mom... - Mom! - Ola! - You're so big now! - Mom, listen... He won't understand. He doesn't know. - What if he leaves me? - Mom... Take it. Take the money go back to the juvie! Go. I'll come visit you. I will. I will. Mom? When will you go running? You have to. My brother is sick. Once he shat himself when they tried to give him a shot. He was small and chubby. Knew all the dinosaurs. Had a whole book about them. He needs shots. But they're too expensive. He won't get them. Who's gonna pay for them? Ola. Get up, will you? You have to get up. Or they'll send you to a loony bin. Magic, magic, all around us... More energy, girls! It's not a funeral!

I need cash. - Bitch. - Get the fuck out. Get the fuck out, now! Did your mom come to see you? They may let me out soon. She asked the court. But it's hard with a murder sentence. And you? Your mother isn't answering. Give the baby up for adoption. Why wait? We have a visitor. She's in the hall. Sure. Ola! You have a visitor. Wait here. - I want to resign. - Talk to my successor. I... Mania told me that you... It's all my fault. - What kind of a mother am I? - It's not like that. Really. How's Mania? She's in the hospital. Do you need anything? I've heard you run. Is this one okay? With a hood, to protect you from the wind. Thank you. I'm on a pass now. I have three years left. Maybe I'll get an early release. Mania will be out by then, too. Come visit us. I... You don't have to say when. Whenever you want to. I'm sorry, I have to catch the last train. Mania said that... That your mom... I'd love to have a daughter like you. Can we train? - You don't have to. - But can we? The championships are coming up. In three weeks. You said I can make the Olympic team. I'd love to train with you. Did you warm up? I always do. Alright. You can still win! You can still win! You'll see! Come on! You can still win! You can still win this thing! Translation: Agata Rudowska
