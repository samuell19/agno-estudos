Kamen Rider 20th Anniversary Project No! Here is tonight's news. A number of women have been murdered recently. Even though the investigation is proving difficult... ...the police's special investigation is doing everything possible to apprehend the culprit. Young women should avoid being outside during the middle of the night. More on this story.... Don't move! We're the police! Don't move! That way! See him? A dream? Are you okay? Shin. Ai. I was here all this time, right? What is it? No... It's nothing. KAMEN RIDER SHIN PROLOGUE Hello there. Welcome. How is it going? To overcome diseases, like cancer and AIDS... ...how about changing the human composition on a cellular level? That's the basis of this research project. First, Level 1 is to improve cell immunity. To completely remove all germs... He's taking food and enzymes. Level 2... Using an artificial womb, the cells are re-inforced. That's all for now. But all that can do is prevent disease, right? What about hereditary or already diseased cells? The cell will be restored to it's original state. When using particle surgery... ...one must proceed carefully. This is Level 3. However, there is a high chance that this project will succeed! Yes. I'm certain you know the reason why. We have two of the best minds in the field of clinical pathology! Kazamatsuri Daimon and Onizuka Giichi. These two professors are the leaders of this project! Hey. What is it? Umm... well... I asked what is it? Understood. Okay. How many times to I have to repeat myself, Onizuka? Currently, it's not possible to have a live test of Level 3! It's too dangerous! I know it's dangerous! For medicine and science... This is a challenge, Kazamatsuri! A challenge? Yes... A challenge against God! And now is the time for our victory! You! Scientific advances always require things like this. Is your only reason "because I said so?" Well... Of course, his cells are healthy. He has no need for Level 3 treatment. But it's needed for this project! We need to know how much the cells can endure! But... Looks like we made a mistake when choosing the test subject. Father, don't worry about me. You, be quiet! Let's take a break. We're not monkeys. I've got no intention of being on display! Okay, everyone. I deeply apologize. No no no. It's hard getting people to work together. Okay, everyone. Let's talk business over there. Please, after you. Father. Oh, Shin. I'm sorry. That man was worried about something, so he lost it. Worried? Nevermind. It's no big deal. What? No... nothing. All paths haves been cut off. What's the big deal over a bunch of stabbings? It's just business. Is it the police? Or is it? The enemy. Eventually, they'll be the enemy. To our organization. Enemy! Yo. I heard the story. Just what are you thinking? Yuuki... I know how you feel about your dad. But... How could you get yourself involved? Did you forget about your dream? About biking and road racing? Did you forget about the World Grand Prix? I didn't really mean to... Don't play dumb! We share the same dream, even as you sacrifice your own cells. It's not like I don't know how you feel. I don't know the details, but your father has sacrificed many tests subjects in his research. For a while, that research was abandoned. But then this lab picked him up. But even with the research re-started, there will be more casualties. Your father was suffering, so that's why you went in yourself. That's what you told me, Shin! Right? Think about her feelings too. Yuuki. Ai! Sit, sit! Hey, Ai, say something to him! Though you come before his friendship with me. I feel like things are turned all around. Yuuki. How about this? Why don't I confess my love to Ai? Yuuki! There you are! If we're confessing our love, I want to go first. None of your business! Guess I'll get to work. See you two. Take your time. Later, Ai. Come on. Let's get to work! Ai! Excuse me, can I get a coffee please? "Police Trap Fails" ...culprit... ...beast... ...unknown... This is...! Ah. This sort of thing has been happening a lot this week. But of course you don't know about it, Shin. You were hidden away all this time, after all. Thanks for waiting. No... I know about it. I... know about this incident. Shin! I... What's happened to me? Stop it! No... No... I... I knew it... it was me... Choosing this test subject was a mistake. Just as I said. He doesn't listen to what I'm saying. Unless he understands, it'll cause problems for everyone. Onizuka. Your father won't stick his own neck in. It's not like you don't understand, you should be thrilled. Of course I know. That's why I've stayed silent all this time. But... But I'm at my limit. Please tell me. You should know, Onizuka! What... What is happening to me?! Please tell me! I don't know what you're talking about. Are you going to force me to talk about yesterday? Onizuka! Originally life, including humans, was rare. There were abilities that couldn't be explained by science. For example, a firefly's light. How they passed information between each other. The wasp's ability to break down fat. Major research has been done on insects, recently! I don't understand you're saying! Just what... And what I've been focusing on is their telepathic ability. Their... telepathy? In other words, how they can convey a variety of things. Joy... Sadness... Fear... Pain... Like physical damage to the body that cannot be seen. They can effectively predict danger! Their shared experience allows them to act as a group. A grasshopper... Yes... It's a grasshopper. In the near future, after humanity has been weeded out by natural selection... This life form has the highest chance of ruling over this world! Don't you think it's beautiful? Don't you think they're wonderful? This is a true nation. A true nation, forgotten by you foolish humans! Nation? And each one of these... ... is a warrior that protects the nation. They are a soldier! They will beat God and restore their nation! This is true science! To do that, you and I must take the risk! What do you mean? Someday, you will know. Even if you don't want to... someday... Onizuka! Father. Onizuka. There's only one thing I want to make clear to you. I am responsible for everything from now on. If you won't follow my plan, then please leave this project! I'll make it clear to you. Kazamatsuri. I am not your employee. What? Nor this labs. It's the organizations. I... No, You and I work to advance this organization. This research all belongs to the organization. Please try not to mess up. "Police Trap Fails" "18 Killed Brutally" Unknown whether culprit is man or beast. It can't be... Just what is this? Who are you? I don't plan to fight you, Shin. Seems we're searching for the same thing. Don't blame me. Co-operate with me. Co-operate? My ultimate goal is to destroy the organization. What do you mean? Who are you? We have to get out! You shouldn't go to the lab! Don't you get it yet? The lab, no, the organizations true goal? What? Shin! What? A woman got in the way? Alright, I understand. Come back immediately. Hello? It's me. Please connect me to the organizations headquarters. Hi! Ai! Bingo! So you were here. Yuuki. Here. I... I'm a killer. A monster that kills people. No... That's wrong! How is that wrong? I clearly remember killing people! Stop it, Shin! Even now... I remember the feeling of killing people with these hands. No! Red blood, pouring out! Stop it, Shin! Stop! Stop this, Shin! I... Shin! Stay away! Shin! Stay back! I could go nuts at any time and attack you guys! Fools! Stay away! Stay away from me! I... I am... scared of myself! Shin! Go away! Please go! Go! Shin! He needs you. You... Even if you are part of that staff. Believe in me, Shin. Please. Damn religious fanatic. What's the big deal about God? What's the big deal about "nation"?! He's an enemy spy. We need to check to see if he's here to ambush us. What's the big deal about science? Shin. Where is Onizuka? Isn't it strange? Someone has disappeared, but nobody is upset? Just what is going on? Ai. Just whose side are you on? Just what is the organizations true goal? What is my father trying to do? What are you hiding? Onizuka has quit. Please, continue with your current research. No. The experiment is cancelled. The trust of my test subject comes before the experiment. Right now, we do not have that trust. Professor. It's not possible for you to back out now. So there is something behind this project! Right? I'm sorry, but I can not take "no" for an answer. For now, I... Just let my son quit. That's all I ask. Is that your condition? If so, then it's too late. What do you mean? Tonight! I will send sample tonight. No. No problem. No problem. I'm asking you what you meant! No trouble. Just explain! I'll call you back later. Thank you. Goodbye. Chief! After I explain, you will co-operate with me. And you will have no conditions, Professor Kazamatsuri. What are you going to do to Shin, chief? Chief! You love him, don't you? That's not relevant. Leave it to me. I won't treat him badly. Just believe in me. For him, and... ...for you. Stop! Fire! I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Shin! I'm sorry. I tried to contact him to get somebody for information. But I didn't think he would be one of them. Just a moment. Come in. Excuse me. Here you go. Thank you. I know that. But he can still reason, like a human being. He helped me! Probably. Because he's a variation level, and his human nature. For the investigation... We should change our plan to capture him. But, uh.. I understand. So... I'm going to use our best team... ...to finish Shin Kazamatsuri, as planned. She's from the CIA? She's working with the national police. They're trying to destroy our research. It comes from the top of the organization. The organization... I also have an information source from inside the police. The organization's information is not mistaken. The organization... Shin... The organization... Organization, organization! Who are you?! Just what are you planning?! What are you trying to do? How long have you been there? Onizuka is dead. What?! You're the only one who can create a new sample, Professor Kazamatsuri. You will co-operate, even if you don't want to... ...with our organization. Politics... Thought... Culture... Economics, and even science. Basically everything that is important in society... ...the organization has influence in. That is the nature of the organization, Shin. The research is just one part of it. You understand, right? It's different than what they've been telling everyone. They're creating monsters, right? They're creating soldiers. Cyborg soldiers. Cyborg soldiers? They serve as a source of funds for our organization. Soldiers can be used as guerilla commanders. At first, the organization was after Level 2. When added to an android, it would create the ultimate living weapon. You saw it, didn't you, Shin?! It has a better system, more intelligence, and much higher power! Inevitably, development began on Level 3. Instead of re-modelling the cells... ...we create new ones. As it sounds, it is a challenge against God. To do that, we invited the best in this field. But... Onizuka realised the research was different from what was planned. He focused on grasshoppers... That was wonderful! That was good. But... then there was that. He used his own body, and remodelled his cells... no... created new cells. A combination of grasshopper and human. My god... A mad advancement in science. The organization tolerated the escalation of this. If successful, he would be the ultimate sample. That was his conclusion. I can't believe he performed Level 3 on himself... ...all just to take data. All the while doing the same thing to Shin's body, without us knowing... If I had realised... You wouldn't have to suffer like this, Shin! I...It's my fault! A combination of grasshopper and human? I see. So that's what this is. Telepathy. It is able to convey all sorts of things. Joy... Sadness... Fear... Pain... They can even detect damage to the body that cannot be seen. Their shared experience allows them to unify! I... I... What will I do now? Return to the lab. It'll be okay. Don't worry. We'll return your body to normal, Shin. This is the fastest way! You understand, right? Hey. That's right. My job was monitor you, Shin. But... But now... If you don't believe me, just wait here! I'll go make a request to the top staff and return! I'll definitely return with a good response! No! What?! Let go! Why? Why me? Be quiet! You'll disturb the baby in you. We examined you while you were sleeping. There's no mistake. It's Shin's... Onizuka, our only sample, is dead. Frankly, that left us at wit's end. But now... We have Shin and that mutant child. Wonderful. Precious samples. We want you to take care of it. If possible, we don't want to kill that child's father. Where is he? You decieved me! You deceived me! You deceived But Onizuka is dead... Who is this? Who is calling me? I have to go! Someone is calling to me for help. I have to go quickly! What's wrong? Are you okay? Send someone, Chief! Chief! Get someone in here! Have you made a decision, professor? Let's talk about that later! What is it? What's wrong? You're the one who said we should treat this as important. We have to take her to a doctor! Open it. Right. Ai. Ai! Let's go. Are you okay? All of them...must be finished. Chief. Even if I surrender... I'll just be held responsible and executed. You guys... ...are going down with me! Shin! Ai! Ai! Hold on! I'm sorry. Shin... I tricked you. But... I loved you. I really loved you, Shin. Ai... Shin! This child... Please... Save it. It doesn't matter what it looks like when it's born. It's the combination of Shin and I. This child... As long as this child is left, I... ...will be at peace. Please. This child... This child... This...child... Ai! Ai... Stay back! Stay away!! Too bad, Shin. I didn't want to kill you. You're the same as Onizuka. No, now that I know you are a new cyborg soldier... I cannot let you live. For the sake of world peace. Goodbye, Shin. It doesn't matter how it looks when it's born. It's the combination of Shin and I. As long as this child is left... I will be at peace. Please, Shin. This child... This child...
