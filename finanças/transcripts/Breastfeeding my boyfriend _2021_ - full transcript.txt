How did it taste today? Sweet. Yeah, because I had pineapple for breakfast. In a world where sex is everywhere... Get rid of taboos and we just need to get on with it. ..one of the body's must natural functions... I desperately need you to nurse. ..has become one of the most taboo topics. Typically, Tip will breast-feed 3-5 times a day. How does it taste? It tastes a bit like cool cereal milk. But with more and more men getting a taste for breastmilk... Oh, yeah. ..and online milky content... They can make me $2,000-3,000 a month. ..becoming big business... They're my money-makers! SHE LAUGHS ..we find out... The feeling is like unconditional love. Adult breast-feeding doesn't have to be sexual. ..why some people... SHE MURMURS ..are breast-feeding their boyfriends. Mm! Can you get me carrots? Yeah. Health-conscious couple Lana and Shawn live in Spain. Recently engaged, they're as committed to each other as they are to their fruitarian diet. We met through a dating site. She started messaging me. And one of the few things that she asks is what is your favourite fruit? That, for me, sounded like a really random question. It sounded like, this girl is weird. Like, I do like that. I'm not into normal girls. And from then onwards, we started feeling, like, a really deep connection, like we knew each other from a past life. And since then, we've been together. We both just were into all the same things. It just seemed like magic that you can find someone so much into the same things as you. Every single thing we connected so well with. It was like the universe had lined everything up for me because I'd been in, like, really bad relationships before and I felt like it was my turn to have something good. The next thing we know, like a few months later, we were moving to Spain together to start a new life. Swept off her feet, Lana also brought her two kids to Murcia as she was so confident Shawn was the one. Obviously, like, when you meet online, you need to go through their images on social media. And I saw a few photos of her looking pregnant... And she looked so beautiful being pregnant and I... ..masturbated that day to that photo of her. When I was pregnant, I was much more, like, natural looking and... Yeah. ..not wearing so much make-up and things like that. And that is connected to the adult breast-feeding because obviously when she was pregnant, she was full of milk. That was, um... ..a big turn-on. Disappointingly for Shawn, Lana weaned her youngest child four years ago and, soon after, stopped producing milk. I used to feel when breast-feeding, like, just a great sense of love and it was like unconditional love, that's what I missed, and that's what made me want to start doing it again with my boyfriend. Before they could start, Lana needed her breasts to start producing milk again - a process that can take months. Following a rigorous breast-pumping schedule, she's also taking milk-inducing supplements, available over the counter in Spain. And so I take two four times a day. But they're prescription only in the UK. It's very demanding to get your milk supply back because you have to be ready to commit to pumping or expressing that milk at least four times a day, so the most important thing was to have the motion of suckling, so I asked Shawn to help me with that. With enough breast stimulation, even childless women can produce milk. And Lana's supplements seem to have sped things up for her. I have only been trying to re-lactate for three days now and my first drop of milk came through when I was hand-expressing. And it's very tiny, but it's a sign of what's to come. Having breast milk makes me feel sexier, more confident and just like more of a woman. I just can't wait to... ..to get some milk. After ten long weeks, the wait is over. Mm! Ready? I think so. OK. THEY GIGGLE That way! All right. THEY LAUGH Tip and Button live on the east coast of America in Hampton Roads, Virginia. Oh, I love you! Four years ago, recently divorced Tip met mum-of-two Button online when she was living over 3,000 miles away in the UK. It was an instant connection. It only became more apparent the more we talked that I could tell this person everything, that I could... That I could share things that I... ..you know, that I've never been able to share with anyone. All right. I'm gonna dump you in! No, don't, baby! Please don't! And over the internet all you can do is talk, and we talked... And talked and talked. And eventually, we came to the subject... ..of breast-feeding. Yes. No, you're coming in with me if you try! All right, all right. The couple never thought they'd meet, but the urge to be together and breast-feed proved irresistible. I was talking about how a little bit of milk would come out, just a tiny little droplet... And I asked, can I see? And so I... ..I expressed that tiny, tiny little droplet of milk and... ..his reaction was immediate. Yeah. And undeniable. I wanted it. And it wasn't anything that I had wanted before, it wasn't anything that I had... ..thought about or desired or went searching for, it was just I saw it when she showed me, and I... I wanted it. I said, "We can make that happen." Ooh! Holy shit! It's so cold! Nervousness is a bit of an understatement. Um... It's not asking for a kiss goodnight, it's not asking if she wants to hold hands or even if, you know, I could stay the night. It's asking for something that's very out of the ordinary, very unusual to ask for, and so I was really nervous about it. SHE LAUGHS God! Nine months later, their fantasy became reality. I was standing and he knelt before me and he latched. And as soon as the milk came, their was just this instant reaction that... Yeah. ..that almost swept me off my feet. Literally, I almost fell over because you were just... ..clutching me to you and making these little noises in the back of your throat. It was like the moment you had the milk on your tongue... Cos, like, I was waiting for it. Agh! This is really pretty. This was the first place that I saw dolphins. And it surprised the hell out of me. How did surprise you? Well, because it's Virginia Beach! Oh, I thought you meant like they were serving ice cream or something! THEY LAUGH Come here, dolphins! Desperately searching online for information on adult nursing relationships, or ANRs, they found nothing, so decided to share their own experiences to help others. So this was our first video that we posted. Yeah. Remember how nervous we were? I wasn't nervous about it. I kind of figured people would kind of get the wrong idea about it, but for the most part, I mean, everyone kind of got exactly what we were trying to convey. I mean, people just came out of the woodwork, just saying, "Please, can we have more stuff like this "cos we can't find it anywhere." Yeah, I mean, if we look at the comments... We got - "Love your breast-feeding content." "I love this. Relationship goals!" It was really, really exciting to see that we were not alone in... ..in having this sort of relationship. And really exciting to get to discuss it with people because... ..for the longest time, we thought we were very much just an oddity. Two years later, their original adult breast-feeding video has been viewed over 300,000 times. We decided to share our adult nursing relationship because it's such a big part of our lives. People think it's a sex life kind of thing, but it's not a sex lives... It's part of our lives, it's part of our relationship. But the only way to share that with anybody is through a porn site because you can't... I mean, you can't just... Post it to Facebook or something like that. What shocked me was how almost overwhelmingly positive the response was from all the viewers. And what was more interesting was how many people just wanted to know more. An instant hit online, within weeks they'd become the X-rated influencers of the adult breast-feeding scene. We generated a lot of talk. Somebody had posted... "What is a Button and Tip?" "What is a Button and Tip?" Right. "I keep seeing this phrase everywhere "and I don't know what that is. "Is that a term or, like, a manoeuvre or something?" What was it she said? That she had heard the words "Button" and "Tip" so often that she thought that we were... ..a technique? A technique. That blew my mind! That blew my mind. I was like, "Oh, my God, we're an educational video." SHE LAUGHS We had to search so hard for information about adult nursing relationships. And the fact that it is easier to find that now, I think is due, in a very large part, to you and I. I agree. I know for a fact that we kind of opened that door. And I'm glad. Me too. You look beautiful. So do you. Our videos were able to kind of get that discussion started so that anybody else feeling alone and bewildered might be able to find support in those comments. Specialist underground dating sites now cater for adult breast-feeders, with tens of thousands of sucklers and nursers searching for their perfect partner. I think we might have changed the world. Just a little bit. In some small way. THEY CHUCKLE I need to shave. In Virginia, Tip and Button, the internet's biggest adult breast-feeding stars, are preparing for their latest shoot. I actually did a video on this lipstick because it stays on... .. through anything. And I mean anything. For two years, they've been posting intimate details of their adult nursing relationship, or ANR, to their 50,000 lactation-loving fans. How's that? Yeah, looks good. You look good, baby. Good shout. Today we're going to be doing the ANR questionnaire video where we talk about what an ANR is and answer a bunch of questions that we've collected over the last few days from viewers. OK? OK. And then we'll be doing a sample nursing video at the end of it. Mm-hm. A little demo. A little demo. OK. So let's get started. We've had questions come in from Reddit, from Twitter. We'll just be addressing the most common questions and a few of the more specific interesting questions as well. Whenever we post new adult breast-feeding content online, we'll get a flood of questions. One of the most common questions we receive is how does it taste? Um, the taste can change depending on what she eats, but for the most part, it tastes a bit like cool cereal milk, so milk with a little bit of sugar in it. You know, why, how, what are we doing, and can they find out more? Sometimes I can taste alcohol when you've really been boozing it up. And then they'll have more direct queries where they would like to know how they could if they wanted to. Here's a good one - "I like to breast-feed, but my partner isn't producing much milk. "I can barely taste it." OK. You can produce more breastmilk. What I would suggest is for five days dedicate yourself, you and your partner, dedicate yourselves to nursing every three hours. You have to wake up in the middle of the night. You'll notice a difference within five days. A major difference. Your body will rush to fill that order, as it were. It's really cool. The best thing to do is just keep doing it. I'm sure I've helped a lot of couples be able to start an adult breast-feeding relationship. And we've given advice and information to countless relationships and couples. So, with that being said, let's go ahead and do a nursing session, which I desperately need. Let's do it. Button pumped relentlessly for four months to produce enough breast milk to feed Tip. Now they nurse a minimum of three times a day. An interesting fact is that the breast that is on the side of your dominant arm, so I'm right-handed, is always going to be fuller. So he is very practised in latching. A correct latch is so important. And, basically, he brings the nipple to the roof of his mouth, the back of the roof of his mouth to the soft palate part, and then he'll use a sucking motion by opening and closing his jaw. And milk will start to just kind of stream into his mouth. You may hear him start to gulp... SHE CHUCKLES ..when that happens. As a man, having the ability to be nurtured by Button, to be held in that way is an amazing thing. And it's really the most wonderful aspect of the adult breast-feeding relationship that I have with her. If you're first starting out and you're really trying to get milk flowing, a good way to breast-feed is for the lactating women to be on top with your breast hanging into his mouth, and that kind of gets gravity to help as well as everything else. The fact that I can be vulnerable with Button, that I can completely drop any pretence of dominance and just completely put myself in her care is a really amazing thing. Thank you. OK. My name is Button, this is Tip, and this was a detailed look into an ANR. Thank you so much. Bye. I love you. I love you too. Finding a partner local enough for regular feeds is no easy task. For many breast-feeding fans, they have to console themselves with erotic lactation videos made by the likes of Milky Mummy in south-west England. I've got three children, two under two, which is quite hard work, and I started making the content when I was pregnant with my baby that's sort of now nearly two. And yeah, just carried on since then. Milky Mummy is one of a growing number of modern mums choosing to work in this risque 21st-century cottage industry. Before I made adult content, I've always worked in health care and I still do that as well as this, sort of privately in the evenings. So I got into making videos mostly through a friend that I knew did the same kind of thing. She sort of said there was quite a big platform and I actually felt really sexy while I was pregnant. I really liked... My boobs were good. And they say "glowing" and I kind of felt like I was glowing in my first pregnancy. Um, so... Earlier videos when I first started were belly rubs, boob rubs... And, yeah, that's how it started and then... ..I started making money from there and, um, I'm still doing it now. SHE CHUCKLES It might seem like a weird kind of thing to some people and, you know, just making money from like squeezing my breasts, but I've made 30 grand for about three hours of work a week, which I'm quite happy to do. Taboo even in the porn world, milky content can be hard to find. I was just getting requests all the time for lactation videos and obviously my boobs were really full at first so milk sort of dripping out of my nipples. Some people have asked me to drink my own milk so, like, actually to suck from my own nipple. It's kind of direct the boob up, the nipple, and, like, sometimes it goes in, sometimes it doesn't and it just kind of squirts everywhere, but, um... ..yeah, I do try. SHE LAUGHS As well as her ever-popular milky spray videos, Milky Mummy has expanded into saucy snaps for her thirsty fans. I think it is quite hard to stand out on social media and that kind of thing, so that's why I like to have this niche, So I went from pregnancy to now the lactating. That's kind of like my thing now. And I do a lot of promotion through a lot of social media sites and my boyfriend actually does a lot of that for me cos he, like, fully accepts sort of what I do and helps me with that side of it. She's posted over 600 scantily-clad photos and videos, with her lactation content becoming liquid gold. Ten-minute video, for instance, it's usually about £40. And... Yeah, but I also started getting a lot of men asking if I did adult breast-feeding, or if I would sell videos of me feeding my partner. Which isn't something I do! SHE LAUGHS But there was a big, big thing for it and most of my fans, you know, are...open to that sort of thing. I'm not entirely sure why there's such a big fetish for adult breast-feeding. I sometimes wonder whether it's kind of like a mother-son kind of issue, maybe. SHE CHUCKLES And maybe it's, like, that closeness with a mother figure. Somebody offered me £100 for 20 minutes, just to come and feed from me. But... ..no. SHE LAUGHS Maybe a million... SHE LAUGHS ..and I might! BABY GURGLES Shh-shh-shh. In Murcia, Spain, also working hard at home is fruitarian Shawn. This garden is sometimes a mess, but I like it. It's my garden. Here I have the babies, the little bits of plants that I'm trying to grow roots on them. Look at this one here. Big, long root, and there's another one here coming out, so that is really good news. In the bedroom, fiancee Lana is also reaping the fruits of her own labour. I've actually been trying to re-lactate, and it's going really well. It seems, like, to have happened so quickly. By the third day, I was ready producing a couple of drops of milk from one side and, within a week, from the other side as well. I also have a lot of toys, because of my job. I used to be a teacher, which was a job I really loved. It was so rewarding. I love children and helping them to learn new things. But I think, in general, it's difficult to get work in Spain, especially if they don't speak fluent Spanish. So, for now, I've completely changed career and I'm making adult content, and I love that too. I have this huge collection of, like, dildos. And it's different every day, just like teaching is different every day. Since the couple's move to Spain, Shawn has also struggled to find work. It is really nice, looking at the sky. Really. Let's go for 20, yeah? OK, fine. OK, go. One... ..two... LANA LAUGHS ..three... Higher up. You need... Yes. Like that. Shawn pushes me to exercise almost every day, and I enjoy it with him sometimes, and sometimes I just don't want to. Shawn's hoping, with enough hard work, and his skills from his previous vocation, they can become a power couple. You're such a monkey. I used to be a personal trainer... There you go. ..and I decided to leave the job, and we picked up adult content. OK? Mm-hm. Let's go. Can you do it with me? Yeah, we can do it together. Shawn's only too aware that, in the fickle adult entertainment industry, looks are everything. I think it's extremely important that we keep fit for the videos. Yeah. I like to be flexible, to do different positions, and... Yeah, that's sexy. ..I feel, like, a pressure on me to stay fit now, which is a good thing. What matters the most is that, at the end, you look fit, you're lovely, I look fit, I'm lovely as well. THEY LAUGH So it works well! Yeah. We mutually started talking about creating adult content. She always wanted to be a porn star, and I really enjoyed acting in the past, so I just wanted to connect two things that I really enjoy, which is... which are sex and acting. We were experiment thing a lot with different types of adult content. THEY GASP AND MOAN This is so messy. Job satisfaction is high... Oh, yeah! ..but a month after posting their videos online, the couple only had 500 fans. Lana and I are really open-minded. We just want to have fun. In a bid to stand out in an oversaturated market, they've decided to share what they get up to behind closed doors. I saw some breast-feeding videos online, and I didn't expect to do it myself... Hey, fans. It's me, Lana, and today I'm going to be bringing you an adult breast-feeding video, because I've had so many messages from fans, asking me for this. ..and here we are, doing it. THEY CHUCKLE Kinky people. Mm-hm. They hope adult breast-feeding can help them carve out a more popular, profitable niche. And somebody asked me if we could do a new position of Shawn laying down, so we're going to try that out today. So here we go. Come on then, Shawn. Mm-hm. Hello, people. Let's go. I always had a big attraction for her when she was pregnant, so this was a natural kink to try, and I think we liked it from the beginning. This is the Lego that I used to play with when I was a child. My nan knew how much I love playing with it, so she gave it to me. Now my children are playing with it. Adult content star Lana moved her family to Spain two years ago to live with her adult content director fiance, Shawn. Got two children - a boy and a girl, aged six and ten - and they're the loves of my life, they changed my life. Yeah, when I had my son, he was such a good baby. He loves reading, as you can see. He's a bookworm. He's also getting to that age now where I'm not seeing him as much as I used to, unfortunately, but I have to let him grow up. I would, like, not let him go if I could. Because I just... I don't want him to go up so fast. He's starting to say all the things that the cool kids say, and... ..I don't know, get a bit more rebellious. But he's still... He's so sweet in nature that he's never really a problem. It was a big decision as a mother to move to Spain, and when I first met Shawn, I was really unsure how he would feel about having to take on two children that are not his. But he has been a really great father figure in their lives. My daughter, she loves to be naughty. But we've kind of got used to that now. I made this chart for them, because I want them to start being even more independent. I've tried just telling them each day what they need to do, but it's not really working, so I've made this chart. And, when they've done all these things, they're ready for school. Because we have a very busy lifestyle, Shawn has to do the children routine of taking them to school. I think I might do it outside, because... And then I have to take supplements at lunch and in the evening, and it's only in the night that I actually get time to breast-feed with Shawn. Hey, guys. It's me, Lana. I'm just making you another update video today. I think that my pregnant cat might be quite near to giving birth. Having recently branched out into adult breast-feeding videos, Lana's making time to film regular updates to keep their paying fans happy. So me and Shawn made a hot video today of some adult breast-feeding, and we had a really close bond, a connection, and I'm sure you'll really want to share that with us. And we will be getting that on to all of our current subscribers later today. So, if you're not subscribed to me yet, make sure you go subscribe, otherwise you'll miss this video, and then you can only pay to view it afterwards. Would you like to see one of our recent contents? Their move into the milky market has already proven popular. I think it's crazy that you guys do this, but total respect, man. Like... THEY CHUCKLE With a rapidly-growing fan base of over 15,000 fans, they've called in social media marketing manager Dani for some help. As we are very ambitious, we obviously are looking forward, and we want somebody to help us out. Yeah. I feel like, as well, it's such, like, a big pool of content in this industry that it can get really difficult to stand out. We have so much going on that it's always... It's just getting a bit too hard to cope with all the work. Mm-hm. So we need somebody to help us, and we need to focus more on the content. Yeah. And that's the most important thing, focusing on the content. Yeah. Agreed. I think it's great that you guys are so busy that you feel like you need to get help in this sector. I think it's amazing. Because the adult breast-feeding niche is so, like, hidden and taboo, with actually got people interested from all over the world. There's, like, people willing for us to travel to them, and, like, they'll pay for everything and have us stay over, just because, like, they cannot find this niche easily in any other place. With such a dedicated audience, cornering the lactation market could be very lucrative for everyone. Like, we get hundreds and hundreds of messages on social media. "I wish my wife would do this, "I wish that my girlfriend would do this." Sometimes it actually gets to me emotionally. Like, I've had days where, like, I've been speaking to a fan and, like, I can feel their loneliness. You say to someone, "I'm going to market for a restaurant." "OK." "I'm going to market for a couple that do breast-feeding." And they go... SHE GASPS THEATRICALLY It's all about breaking away from this taboo lifestyle. Like, get rid of taboos, this is real, it's happening for everyone, in everybody's life, and we just need to get on with it. We need to increase the awareness, we need to increase the overall positivity. I do want to help remove the taboo around the subject, because it is... Yeah. Yeah. Everyone watches it, everyone's been involved with it somehow, and it is quite a natural thing. It's about making it marketable so people understand what you're doing. I definitely... I like the message that you guys are spreading, and I really want to be involved... Yeah. ..with helping spread that kind of message. I like what these guys stand for, and I think that we're going to work really well together, so... I'm really glad we met you, Dani. The perfect person, like...with us. I think this is going to be a ride. Definitely. Yeah, we need to get together, yeah. THEY LAUGH in Virginia, the godfathers of the adult breast-feeding scene, Tip and Button, are so inseparable they live and work together. And they're just finishing a long night shift. God, what a day. That was pretty rough. I hope you're thirsty. Oh, my God. I just want to get home. 15 hours in a warehouse without feeds means Button's breasts are achingly full of milk. Baby... Yes? ..I desperately need you to nurse. I am hurting. Let's get out of here. OK. Sure you don't want to do it in the car? No, let's go home and relax. Breast-feeding someone releases the happy hormone, oxytocin - for you and them. So some people find it the perfect way to unwind. Typically, on any given day, Tip will breast-feed three to five times a day. Generally before work, after work, before bed and when we wake up. Sometimes it's more than that. Sometimes it is a challenge to find the time to breast-feed, although we will make the time, because it is important. Not just physically but emotionally, it is important to us that we connect that often on a daily basis. It feels like sinking into a warm bath, and also just kind of a feeling of contentment. I feel more close to him now than I've... ..than I feel during any other time. You know, this is incredibly intimate. Whereas kissing used to be the most intimate thing. And now... ..this is... This is above and beyond. Far above and beyond. And I just feel very much in love with him. And I feel protective and that he's precious to me. The couple believe the strong bond they feel is in part due to Tip never knowing his biological mother. They're going to talk about him being adopted. I'm adopted? SHE LAUGHS Tip spent the first formative year of his life in a Korean orphanage, having been left there as a newborn. Because I was a baby when I was adopted, growing up in that environment, you just get used to everything. You don't really notice it but at the same time, it was never a secret that I was adopted. It wasn't something they tried to keep from me. It was always known and my mother had a really great way of putting it. If any other kids ever made fun of me for being adopted, I was to tell them that at least my mother chose me. Ooh! I love that! Which is such a mom thing to say. I love that so much! You were so cute. Sweater vest and a bowtie. I still have this outfit, I bet. I bet I can still rock it. Tip was brought to America by his adoptive father, who was serving in the military in Seoul. Looking good. Oh, look at you! Yeah. Oh, look at your face! Yeah, I was a handsome fella. Oh, my gosh. HE LAUGHS That's you as an actual baby. This is probably the only baby photo that exists of me. I think they actually used this as my passport photo when I came to America the first time. As an adult, now I kind of have theories as to why I'm so drawn to the ANR and the nursing, because I didn't get that, because I was immediately given up for adoption and then I was in a facility, so I wasn't breast-fed as a baby and I feel like that's probably got a little bit to do with why I'm so drawn to it now as an adult. Oh, there we go. That is an adorable picture. White socks with brown shoes? Come on, man! No, you were so cute. 100%. 100% it is the maternal aspect that draws me to it, yeah. It's one of the most wonderful aspects of her, and it's something that I'm constantly finding myself drawn to. You know, I don't try to pretend that she's my mother, she doesn't try to pretend that I'm her son. It's about being nurtured, it's about being held, it's about completely giving myself over to that and just that absolute feeling of being taken care of. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. This is where I keep my lingerie. In the West Country, Milky Mummy's clear why she's making milk videos. She's being very well taken care of by her highest paying customers. Most of the underwear that I have has been purchased by many of my fans. Maybe a black version. I never really thought it's something I would go into making, breast-milking videos, but I've always had a very high sex drive and been a sexual person, so taking pictures and videos is always sort of something I would do and it just sort of fell into place. Also, this was a purchase for me, which has got some sort of little cat ears and a choker and a butt plug tail. I get all sorts of requests for my milk videos. Spraying, drinking, showering. My milk dribbling on the floor, spraying on my partner, spraying on myself. The tail butt plug with the collar and the ears, which was around £25, and also paid for the video, which was about $95 for ten minutes of me crawling around in the outfit and milking my breasts. It's quite unbelievable, just being at home, making these videos, can be such a big earner for me. Sometimes I find it very odd and my boyfriend may have a bit of a laugh but, you know, my boyfriend has weird fetishes. So do I. I don't judge anybody. My boyfriend's going to die! Shall I say what it is? No. Don't let me! To really monetise her milk and keep her audience wanting more, Milky Mummy's getting creative. So I make content kind of all around the house, really, so downstairs... I think I've actually made some in the kitchen. Even in the landing, I sort of made one on all fours. Made a lot in the bathroom as well because it can get messy but obviously in here it's easy to clean it up. It's a good floor so just bring the mop up and clean it and then it's like nothing's ever happened. I think we might use this light. OK. Hoping to clean up with his latest adult breast-feeding video is director Shawn. His creative vision has helped the couple rack up a whopping 4.5 million views, so he's gone professional. The camera is going to go here. Yeah, round here is probably good. And also we're going to have to remove a few things that we don't want. I've never liked those cushions. The best comment that we've ever received on a video is somebody saying that it's literally the best video they've ever seen in their life. The frame is going to be pretty boring so I'm not sure if I want to add something to the picture. HE CHUCKLES We want to be the best-known people in the adult breast-feeding market. The couple now rake in up to 6,000 euros a month from their breast-feeding videos. Oh, yeah. That's feeling better. But as their main source of income, they can't afford to get anything wrong. Obviously nowadays adult content is really competitive because we live in the 21st century, 2021, so if you don't put any intensity in your image, you're not going to connect that well with the viewer. Yeah, that works really well. Get ready. Yeah. Cool. What do you think? I want to see you in the light. Sit down, please. Yeah, this works so much better. Works really well with what we've got. Good. OK, let's get into it. Let's go. OK. So I'm quite full now. It's been all day. Breast-feeding feels like peace. It feels really relaxed. It's really nice. That good? Mm-hmm. In the heart of south-west England, it's just another working day for mother-of-three Milky Mummy. So this is where the milk magic happens. Just, yeah, I wear a lot of different lingerie and just milk my tits. Because that's what they want to see! This is like, impossible, to make taking leggings off sexy! I think there's a really big like for a kind of milf-type woman that has imperfections and curves. I get a lot of guys asking to see stretchmarks. INHALES: OK. Suck it all in! I think they just like the fact that we're mums. I've never been a confident person. I'm actually very shy. It has actually made me a lot more confident and realise, you know, we don't all have to be perfect... ..to be loved for what we are and who we are. Her 14,000 faithful followers have supported her throughout her pregnancies, making milk the perfect way to pay the bills. A lot of people do judge doing this kind of work and people that don't kind of understand but I can be a stay-at-home mum, look after my children, which is my main priority, make these videos evenings and weekends, and make quite a good living off of it, so... It's, you know... I don't care. And that is that. My money-makers! Oh, yeah. So it's actually sure? Uh-huh. With milky content making it into the mainstream and a growing legion of lactation lovers, are the barriers to adult breast-feeding finally being broken down? So much milk. Feels so relieving, doesn't it? After being full all day. It's very hard to compare adult breast-feeding to something but I would say the feeling is comparable to, like, unconditional love or, you know, just that, like, flood of happiness. How did it taste today? Sweet. Yeah? Because I had pineapple for breakfast. Let's not forget the nutritional value of it. I think adult breast-feeding is a kink because society has told us that you have to stop when a baby is around one year old. You never see it happening again but I think there's always that instinct to bring it back, but it's always hidden, it's always underground, and it shouldn't be. SHE SCREAMS Oh, my God! Oh, my God, that's horrible! No, not faster! Slower! Make it stop! Please! Oh, my God! Have you never sat in a spinny cup? No, I've not! They didn't exist when I was a kid. You act like you're high. Adult breast-feeding has been extremely fetishised and considered a fringe kind of kink, which feeds into the taboo. This is much better than the spinny cup. This is my kind of ride. If it's a taboo, then people obsess over it privately in the dark, and then it becomes a fetish, whereas I think adult breast-feeding is a very great way to express a relationship... Oh, my ass! That's what she said. ..and to have a relationship and something that can strengthen a relationship. It doesn't have to be sexual and it shouldn't be fetishised and shouldn't be a taboo. OK. Cross your legs. Yeah, it's rare we do photo shoots with all our clothes on. SHE LAUGHS It's certainly not for everyone but the adult breast-feeding relationship has certainly helped me in finding a deeper connection with my partner. You look very pretty. I don't think that more people should be in an adult breast-feeding relationship. What I do think is that there should be more awareness, that it is a positive thing. Now give me a big kiss. And that way they can make a more informed, personal decision whether they want to experience this with each other and if they don't, then they don't, but if they do, I would absolutely encourage people to look into it.
