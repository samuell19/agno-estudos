with my rope and my saddle and my horse and my gun I'm a happy cowboy if I'm riding with my cattle and I'm always on the run I'm a happy cowboy you can bet your bottom dollar that you'll never hear me holler 'bout the word on the range and I love to hit the leather in any sort of weather and I know I'll never change with my rope and my saddle and my horse and my gun I'm a happy cowboy so when the day is endin', mm, 'neath the setting sun a happy cowboy's work is found let's have a drink on that, eh? Oh, boy. Trying to fill up this old hat box. (Liquid sloshing) That's Joe's letter. Ain't it? Oh yeah, yeah. But what kind of trouble do you suppose he's in? I don't know, but it must be somethin' pretty bad, 'cause Joe's not the kind to holler for help unless he really needed it. That's right. When he was ridin' range with us down in Texas, he always took care of any trouble that came his way. Sickness was the only thing that ever licked him. When his lungs went bad... But I thought he got well since he came up here in Arizona. That's what he wrote me. Said him and his dad had bought a little ranch and they was gonna stock it with some good cattle. Well, how far do you reckon it is from here to Joe's place? About a mile or two from here. Come on, let's go. That must be Joe's place over there. (Dog barking) "Let 'er run along." (Barking) (Clucking) (Mooing) (Barking) "What you tryin' to do, Rob the boss of a chicken dinner?" "To throw the voice for a greater distance, it is im... perative that..." (Galloping) Howdy. Is this Joe Jackson's place? Well, yeah. Who are you? Did that mule say somethin', or am I hearin' things? Sure, he talks. Gabriel, say somethin' for the gentlemen. "He think he go home. He want to be alone." (Laughing) I'm Bob Blake. I'm looking for a friend of mine, uh, Joe Jackson. Well, this is his place, all right. I'm slim Perkins. I think it'd be a good idea if you go into the house and talk to Joe's sister. Joe's sister? I don't know. Say, mister, would you sell me that talkin' mule? Well, now, I'll see about that. Are you Joe's sister? Well, uh, I'm Bob Blake. Oh yes, I've often heard Joe speak of you. I'm Betty Jackson. Joe used to work with you down in Texas... - Didn't he? - Uh, yes'm. But what are you doin' way up here? Well, I had a letter from Joe, and brought some of the boys, and we come up to see if we could help out some. You say Joe wrote you a letter? Well, when was it written? It says here it was written on the 16th in mesa canyon. Thank heaven, then he's not dead. Dead? What do you mean? I haven't seen my brother for three weeks. He disappeared just like father did, only we found father... dead. Shot in the back. Do they know who did it? No, but Joe said he'd find out if it took the rest of his life. He was all worked up the day he disappeared. Said he'd found something, but wouldn't tell me until he was sure. And I thought they'd got Joe, too, but... but that letter's in his handwriting, and... Now don't you worry, miss Betty. We'll find Joe, and we'll find the man who dry-gulched your dad. How far is it to mesa canyon? Seven files due south. And you positively guarantee that this here critter can talk? You heard him, didn't you? Yeah, but what I mean is we'll he talk for me like he talks for you? Boy, I positively guarantee that he talks just as much for you as he did for me. Come on, give me the 12 dollars, will you? Looks like you've bought some stock, Dusty. Bob, I've got the only mule in the world that speaks English. - Speaks English? - Yup. Slim here said this mule's pappy talks too, but he only speaks German. That's no good, 'cause nobody'll understand him. This here mule speaks English. Dusty, did you ever hear of a ventriloquist? You don't mean to tell me that this here mule's one of them things? No, not the mule, but slim. Oh, well, that's all right. I don't care what he's sufferin' from long as the mule's okay. (Laughing) Come on, boys, hit leather. We're gonna take a quick look at mesa canyon. Which is the quickest way, slim? Well, there ain't but one road, and it takes a bloodhound to find that. Expect I better ride in with you. Okay, come on. Now listen, fellas. Somebody in that burg has got old Joe hogtied and staked out. He was there on the 15th, and it's my notion that he's still there. Now the best way to start will be to trickle in there one at a time. Keep your eyes and ears open and meet back here at five o'clock. Oh, let's make it four-thirty. I got to get back to the ranch by five o'clock to give my mule a singin' lesson. (Laughing) (Murmur of conversation) (Men humming) gonna saddle my bronc and hit the trail almost time for round-up gonna follow them dogies' waggin' tails almost time for round-up almost time almost time for round-up almost time almost time for round-up when tumbleweeds tumble against the old drift fence almost time for round-up and the groundhog acts like he's got some sense almost time for round-up almost time almost time for round-up almost time almost time for round-up when the coyote howls at the harvest moon almost time for round-up and you know Jack frost is a-comin' soon almost time for round-up almost time almost time for round-up almost time almost time for round-up when the Willow tree leaves fall upside down almost time for round-up and the prairie dog Burrows deep in the ground almost time for round... (gunshot) ... up almost time almost time for round-up Where you goin', strangers? Man talkin' to you. He's lookin' right at you. Tell him where we goin'. All I know is I'm goin' fast and far. Have a drink. Uh, I don't drink, but he does. Bartender, give that man a drink. Well, I don't think I care about... Have a drink. I don't think I care about refusing any. (Nervous laughter) Have a cigar. Thank you. Take four. Thank you, thank you. Don't put 'em in your pocket, smoke 'em. Smoke all these? That's what I said. (Laughing) (Laughing) Drink up, man. Bring me three more glasses. Fill 'em. Now drink 'em. All of 'em. All of 'em at once? Now you drink all that liquor, and you smoke all of those cigars. And if you drop one drop of that whiskey, or you drop the ashes off one cigar, I'm gonna let the daylight in through you. Come on, smoke up. Why you... Havin' a little trouble, Dusty? Bob. That gentleman is just carryin' hospitality too far. What's the big idea, fella? You didn't have that gun, I'd show you. I wouldn't draw that, mister. Boys, I guess I'll be leaving you. Leavin' us? Guess again, brother, guess again. Boys, make yourself at home while I rustle up some grub. - Okay, slim. - Okay, slim. Be with you in a minute, fellas. I'm goin' up and have a talk with miss Betty. Oh, there you are, partner. How you doin'? Now look here, mule. You might as well get this straight right now. I'm the boss, and when I talks to you, you answer me, you savvy that? Now this kind of action ain't gonna get you no place with me. Now there you go showin' your ignorance. Is that polite? I asked you. Say somethin', doggone your hide. Hey, what's the matter, Dusty? What kind of a job is this? Why, that fool mule won't talk. Well, I don't believe he can talk. "I'm particular who I talks to." Was the mule said that, or was that you? You was lookin' right at me. Did I say anything? All right, we'll start all over again. Say somethin', uh, Gabriel. "Okay, toots." You see? You got to call him by his name. What is his name? Gabriel. Go ahead, call him that. Mm-mm, not now. Why not? You... you go on away. That mule is just full of conversations when you standin' 'round. Now what I craves to know is can he talk when you ain't here. Okay, cowboy, but remember the name. Gabriel. I say there, Gabriel, old fella, how's tricks? "Oh, I can't kick." You can't kick, eh? Well, that's fine. I'm glad to hear that. Now listen, Gabriel, let's get down to business. I aims to teach you somethin'. "Who's gonna teach which to what?" I'm gonna teach plenty, to you. "Ain't you heard?" Ain't I heard what? "The teacher's got to know more than the pupil." Now look here, Gabriel, I done paid 12 dollars for your worthless hide. "That's more than I'd pay for yours. 'Sides, I bet the money was stole." I never stole nothin' in my whole life. "No? What about them silver spurs you's wearin'?" I won them spurs playin' poker with slim. If that's stealing, well, I don't know. "Sure is when the deck's got six aces in it." I's beginnin' to understand why slim was so willin' to sell you. ratatat datatat datatat datatat I took my roll and went to town with some gal and played around and she cut my bankroll down ho-ho-ho, I got the payday blues roll the dice, to my surprise not so nice, two snake eyes and I never will get wise ho-ho-ho, got the payday blues boom boom boom now I am confessin' got that gambling craze will I learn my lesson? oh, I'll be broke for 30 days I can't trust at the store I'm a bust and am I sore I'll be broke for one month more ho-ho-ho, I got the payday blues boom boom boom I got the payday blues I got the payday blues boom boom boom I can't beg or borrow from my friends or boss and it's to my sorrow maybe got to trade my horse not a dime in my jeans I can't buy pork and beans now I know what misery means ho-ho-ho, I got the payday blues ratatat ratatat ratatat ratatat ratatat ho-ho-ho, I got the payday blues ratata tatata ratatat dat-ee-a datata ratatat ratatat ratatat ratatat ratatat ho-ho-ho, I got the payday blues why can't I be thrifty? must I spend my change? what comes when I'm 50 and too old to ride the range? ratatat ratatat ratatat ratatat ratatat ho-ho-ho, I got the payday blues da dong dong dong dong dong dong oh I got those payday I got those payday blues Dusty, don't you know nobody never got nothin' from whittlin' on a stick? Well, I'm gonna get somethin' with this. Where you goin', Dusty? I'm goin' to get 12 dollars with this. Looks to me like slim is in for some trouble. That's right, Bob. Dusty's on the warpath. (Laughing) (Banging) Ventriloquism in ten easy lessons. Hot dog. Hey, slim. Come here. Well, that's buck Thorne, the man that owns a big range that borders on on this place. Good mornin', miss Betty. Good morning. You look worried, Betty. What's on your mind? Mr. Thorne offered to buy the ranch. Of course if Joe's alive, the place belongs to him, but if he's... Oh, Betty, don't give up so easy. I've got a hunch Joe's alive and well. And if he is, we'll find him. But it's been over a month now and no trace of him. Say, what does buck Thorne want with this place? He's got a thousand acres over there without a head of cattle on it. What does he want with more land? I don't know. He said he wanted to help me out. Oh, Bob, if we could only do something... About Joe, I mean. We'll do something. Buck Thorne wants to help her out. Why, that hombre wouldn't help his own mother out of a tub of boiling oil unless there was somethin' in it for him. Did you say there's no cattle on his place? Nary a head. But he's got a tough-lookin' bunch of hands over there, though. And I'd like to know what for. Come on, slim. Let's find out. Did she say she'd sell? No, not yet. She said the place belonged to her brother, and she couldn't sell it until she knew for certain that he was dead. I guess that lets us know what to do with him, don't it? Yeah. We could fix it so she could find the body easy enough. I'm for making a last try to get him to sign before we... Ah, you make me sick. Always wantin' to do everything the hard way. The sooner we get him out of the way, the better. I'm running this show, Pete. You tried your rough stuff on the old man, and what did it get? Well, they can't hang you any higher for two killings than they can for one, if they catch you. Howdy. I'm Bob Blake, friend of Joe Jackson's. My name is Thorne. Don't bother to introduce me to your friend there. We've already met. What do you want with Joe Jackson's ranch? Who said I wanted it? Well, you do, don't you? I offered to buy it just to help the girl out. She can't do anything with it. Listen, let me give you a little advice. Go back where you came from and mind your own business. You might first find out what my business is. Well, what is it? My business is to find Joe Jackson, or the man that killed him and his father. That guy is poison. You oughta let me drill him. Next time I will. That's a promise. What'd you make of that? Well, one thing. I'm sure there's somethin' wrong with that outfit. Well, what's your next move? I wish I knew. Well, see you later. Hello, Dusty. How is you and Gabriel gettin' along these days? Fine. We had a long talk the other day. You don't say. Yup. I aim to teach him some poetry. Poetry? Oh man, that mule can't recite no poetry. You crazy. I'll bet you 12 dollars that mule will recite poetry before me and the boys pull out of here. Now that's a bet. Shake on it. Say, Dusty, do you know how to play seven up? Never heard of it. But I'll play a little poker with you. Poker? Yeah, poker. All right. But with my cards. Come on. A little ride'll do you good. I've got somethin' I want to talk over with you. Well, yes, but let's get goin'. We can talk later. I calls. What's your bet? Read 'em, boy, a full house. You sure gets good hands when you deals. Give me another stack of chips. For what? I'll give you an IOU. Yeah, but who gonna sign it with cash? Stetson. What's the matter, uncle? Is your mule sick? No sir, miss Betty, he's sound in wind and limb. Then why are you walking? Well, you see, the cinch strap broke and I had nothin' to fix it. Oh, we'll fix that in a jiffy. Mighty kind of you, sir, to bother with an old man like me. You're a stranger in these parts, ain't you? Yeah, my home's down Texas way. Texas, a mighty fine country. I was down there when I was a young man, but that was many years ago. There you are, uncle. What might your name be? My name is Bob Blake. Are you from Pecos? Why yes. Well, I do declare. When you cast your bread upon the waters, it sure comes back to you. What do you mean? Two or three weeks ago, I found a letter addressed to you, and there's no stamp on it, so I put one on and mailed it to you. You mailed a letter to me from mesa canyon? Is this the letter? That's the very one. Where'd you find this? I found it in the alley back of buck Thorne's saloon. Buck Thorne's saloon. Are you sure of that? I'm dead certain. Found it right there lyin' in the dust. Buck Thorne's saloon. Thank you, uncle. You've done me a bigger favor than you'll ever know. So glad. Bye, uncle. So long, uncle. Good bye. What do you make of that, Bob? How come Joe's letter to be lying in the alley? Well, here's how I figure. They're holding Joe at that buck Thorne. They left him alone for a few minutes and he scrawled out this note. Then he heard 'em comin' back and he tossed it out the window hoping that somebody would find it and mail it, and that's just how it happened. Then you think Joe's alive? I'm sure of it, Betty. What'll we do? Well, I'm goin' to the buck Thorne and get Joe out of there. You'd better come back and get the boys. No, I'll do better playin' a lone hand. Now you get back to that ranch and don't leave until I get there. And don't say anything to the boys about it. I'll push the pot. I raise you. Listen, brother, put your hand under that table just once more, just once more, and the next time you go to buy gloves, buy one. I raise you. I call you. How many cards you want? Give me two. Yeah, two. I thought you said two. You the opener, what's your bet? Hello, miss Betty. Where's slim? I don't know, miss Betty. - Do you want me to find him? - Yes. Tell him I want to see him right away. (Knocking) Hey, slim! Miss Betty want to see you pronto. Okay. So long, Dusty! I'll be seein' you. Give me a drink. Say, you, bring me a drink. Comin' right up. Where do you think you're goin'? I'm goin' upstairs to the dining room. There ain't no dining room up there. You stay down here where you belong. Okay. No dining room. This is a heck of a joint. Bring me that drink. You mean to tell me Bob Blake went into the buck Thorne saloon after what happened the last time he was there? He told me not to tell you, but I'm worried. You got a right to be worried. Well, that place is a rattlesnakes' den. I'll get the boys and get him out of there, and Joe, too, if he's there. I'll never sign that deed. I know what you're after. You found a ledge of gold on your property, and it petered out on your land and ran over on mine. I found it, too, the day you grabbed me. As long as you know so much, you may as well know one thing more. There's a million dollars in that ledge, and we're going to get it. Untie him. You should have let me finish him off the day he came to the ranch. (Gunshots) Here, this way. (Gunshots) (Gunshots) Bob, are you okay? Hey, hey. How you comin', Bob? Feelin' all right, huh? Hey, how did you boys get here? How'd we get here? Why, we had to fight through the bar, man. Yeah, he was here in this room. Must have went that way. And they carried Joe with 'em. Man, you are lucky to be alive. What happened? I don't know. Come on, Bob. I'm all right. Give me my guns. Bob, they got clean away. Not a trace of 'em. Come on, we'll find 'em. Well, she's not in the house. Horses gone, saddles too. I guess she decided to help. Lord only knows where she's gone. Where's my brother? Take it easy, young lady. Joe's okay. But that man came to the house and said that he was here he's here all right, but he hasn't been hurt... yet. What do you mean? Take me to him. All right. Come on. Betty, what are you doin' here? That man came to the house and said you were here and that you were hurt. What's the idea, Thorne? It's very simple. Now you wouldn't want anything to happen to your sister, now would you? If you'll both be nice now and sign this deed, why, nobody'll get hurt. But you offered to buy the ranch for 5,000 dollars. The offer is still good. That's certainly nice of you, Thorne, with a million dollars' worth of gold on the property. Did you find anybody on Thorne's ranch? Nary a soul. But I didn't really expect to. Did miss Betty show up? Where's Dusty? I got a-scared so I sent him to fetch the sheriff. Oh, I thought his horse went lame. He's ridin' Gabriel. (Laughing) What do you say? Will you sign? It's Joe's ranch, and if he won't sell it, All right, Jack. How 'bout signin' that paper? Listen, you yellow rat. You and your gang killed my father, and you may kill me too. But you'll never get that ranch long as I'm alive. Give me that iron. Stop them, stop them, I tell you! You can't do that to him! Will you sign? Hold her, boys. (Sizzling) Look, uh, uh, there... There's miss Betty's horse! It sure is. But where's miss Betty? Suppose she's been thrown off? Oh no, not miss Betty. Well, let's follow this horse's back trail. I saw him come out of that canyon. Come on, boys, hit leather. Come on, boys. Come on! There, now let him go. Not so fast. Watch her, boys. Where do we stand now? We're no better off than we were. It's no good without his John Henry, but I'll get that, too, as soon as they make him conscious. Yeah, but what do we do with him after he signs it? What do you think? Here it is, fellas, here's the trail. Still feeling obstinate, Joe? I'll feel okay the day they hang you. What is this, a wild goose chase? That's miss Betty's horse over there, ain't it? Yeah, but where's miss Jackson? How do I know? Where's slim? Where's everybody? Look at it, sheriff. A lot of horses just went through here, and from the looks of those prints, they left mighty sudden. Come on, boys, let's see where those tracks lead to. You're the lowest rat that ever lived, but you can't be low enough to do that. Can't I? Go ahead, Pete. Stop, stop, I'll sign, I'll sign. No, Joe, don't sign it. I'm not afraid of them. Reach for the sky. Drop them guns. What's the matter here? Well, if it ain't our hero. I'm sure glad to see you. Come on, Pete. You can settle your private score in a minute. In case I forget, remind me to kill you. Bring those others in over there. Let the girl go, Thorne. Listen, buck. I'm tough as the next man, but shootin' women is out of my line. Mine too. But what are we gonna do with her? She knows too much. Now you listen to me. It's either them or us. Which'll it be? Get ready. As for me, I'd rather have the girl on my conscience than a rope around my neck. Get ready. Here comes the law. Hey, hey. Drop those guns. Pull it in, men. Shoot to kill. (Gunshots) Gun, I want to send a message and I don't want no answer. (Gunshot) Special delivery. You found the right address. Sheriff, if you can get those cutthroats to jail, I'll be in to swear out a warrant for them for murderin' my father. If I can take 'em to jail? My man, they're practically in jail now. Come on, boys, take 'em to town. What's that? Did the man have his will all wrote out? Ha, no, Dusty, this is a deed. Oh, don't be ignorant. It's a deed, his last will and testament. Did he leave you all his property? Nope, I won't be needin' his property. There's a million dollar worth of gold on mine. That's why they wanted it so bad. Let me shake your hand. That's plenty money. Speakin' of large sums of money, reminds me of our bet. - What bet? - Didn't you bet me 12 dollars that I couldn't make that mule talk poetry? Yeah, but where's your 12 dollars? Man, I even own the clothes you're standin' in. Well, I still got Gabriel, ain't I? I'll bet you the mule against my clothes and my 12 dollars. Bet. Bob, hold the stakes here. Come on, hold the stakes, Bob. Come on, let me see you make that mule go literary. Just keep your good eye on me, boy. "There was an old geezer named slim. I used to be owned by him. When the old rascal sold me, my new master told me he was gonna get slim on a limb." Wait a minute, he ain't through yet. "You may wonder why I'm mule-headed. To admit it, I always have dreaded. But you all know slim, I belong to him. Birds of a feather... You said it." (Laughing) You win, Dusty. Here's your money. Welcome home. Aw, don't look so bad, slim. I'm gon' give you back your old talkin' mule. I don't want him. I'm fixin' to get married, and I don't want no talkin' mule around. Nuh-uh. Mm-mm. Well, guess I'll have to give him to Bob. Bob ain't gonna want him. How come he won't? Look! get along, mule keep on riding get along, fool long road a-winding get along, mule carry me back to home boo-boom, boo-boom, boo-boom I've been away, way for a long time now I will stay home for a long time get along, mule carry me back to home boo-boom, boo-boom, boo-boom in the night way up on the hilltop silvery moon draws near boom boom boom stars are bright and I never will stop till my cabin appears get along, mule get your hooves flying get along, mule keep on tryin' get along, mule carry me back to home boo-boom, boo-boom
