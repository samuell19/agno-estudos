It's Elmo's favorite time of year! - Louie: Mm-hmm. - Me, too! Me, three! That's three, three excited children! Ah ah ah! ( organ playing, thunder ) Eh, Christmas is the worst. All this cheerfulness and gift giving. Blech! Well, Oscar, what do grouches celebrate? For your information, we grouches celebrate Crankymas. It's when you invite your family over to argue and give each other junk. Oh, how festive. Now, if you'll excuse me, I just got a heavy, disgusting, sticky fruitcake for Crankymas, and I can't wait. Heh heh heh. Yuck. Well, lots of people like to celebrate different things this season. That's true. At my house, we also celebrate El Día Los Reyes, Three Kings Day. ¡Oh, yo también, yo también! And we eat king's cake, el rosca de reyes. - It's so much fun! - Elmo: Wow! Yeah, and there's also Hanukkah and Kwanzaa. There are so many ways people celebrate the season. Yeah, me so excited to see what Santa going to bring this year! Me ask for something very special! Ooh! Let me guess-- cookies! - Yeah. How'd you know? - ( all laughing ) - Hey, guys. - Merry Christmas, everybody! All: Merry Christmas! Say, Bert and I are throwing a Christmas party, and you're all invited! - Want to come? - I've got the yule log video! - Rosita: Hmm. - Hmm. It's the director's cut. All: Uh... Uh, we're-- we're also singing carols! - Nina: Oh, sure. I'll come! - Alan: Sounds like fun! Yeah! Well, we'd love to, but I think it's time to head off to bed. Oh, yeah! Elmo almost forgot to leave out cookies for Santa. Cookies? Did someone say cookies? - Heh heh heh. - Ha ha ha! Good night, everyone. Good night! Merry Christmas! Hey, hey, Abby. Check this out. Check this out. This is the really cool part right here. - Oh, Bert. - Bert: You got to watch closely. Oh, come on, Elmo. It's beddy-bye time. Elmo: Oh, wait, Daddy! Elmo forgot something. Ha ha ha! Boy, Elmo almost forgot to leave cookies out for Santa. Oh, oh, oh. Good thinking, son. Ha ha ha! Oh, boy! Elmo's so excited for Christmas. Elmo's gonna put these cookies right here where Santa can see them! Okay. Now climb on up in here. Oh, okay. Time to get all snug as a bug in a rug. Yeah! Ha ha ha! - Heh heh heh! - Ahh. ( smacks lips ) Ahh. Ahem. ( inhales ) Oh. Daddy, well, why do we leave cookies for Santa? - Uh, why do we leave cookies out for Santa? - For Santa! Well, Elmo, that is a very good question there, and, uh, I've got a bedtime story that will answer it. - Want to hear it? - Oh, yeah! Elmo loves Daddy's bedtime stories. Ha ha! Well, uh, ahem. Uh, it all started once upon a time on Christmas Eve... - Oh! - ...long, long ago. Uh, back then, uh, Sesame Street was a very different place. Oh, well, different how? Well, uh, oh, for one thing, it didn't look anything like it does today. Louie: It looked very different. There were no cars or electric lights, and the people were different, too, all except for a few great-great relatives of some people you know. Hello, everybody! It is I, your fuzzy and adorable 19th-century traveling salesmonster. Could someone please tell me how to get to Sesame Street? Oh. Hello. Can you tell me how to get-- uh, yeah-- how to get to Sesame Street? ( sighs ) Anyone? - You're here. - Hmm? This is Sesame Street. Oh, thank you. You know, it is so strange. No one else here would even speak to me. Well, that's because I'm the nicest guy in town. - You are? - Yep. Now take your stuff and scram! - ( bell ringing ) - Elmo: Wait a minute! Oscar was the nicest person on Sesame Street? Oh. You're talking about Oscar the Grouch, right? Remember, this was a long, long time ago on Sesame Street, so it was actually Oscar's great, uh-- great-grand grouch Oscar the Malcontent, but-- but, yes, he was the nicest person. Mm, yeah, that doesn't make any sense to Elmo. Well, I did say things were different back then. You see, even though on the outside the people might have looked the same, on the inside, they were very different than they are today. Hello, first customer of the day, and what a lovely day it is, don't you think? - ( groans ) - I have a very special item to offer you. It is this handy, dandy welcome mat, a wonderful addition to any home. What would I want with one of those? Uh, to put on your doorstep of course. - Why? - Well, to be friendly and invite people to enjoy the comforts of your lovely home. That way, all of your neighbors will know that they are... - Ugh! - ...welcome? Heh heh heh. Listen. Don't take it personal, pal. You see, that's just the way people are on our street. What? They don't like welcome mats? No. This is Sesame Street, the unfriendliest street in town! - ( bell ringing ) - Elmo: Hang on, hang on. The unfriendliest street in town?! Sesame Street?! Well, as I said... Both: Things were different then. - Right. - Yeah. But wait a minute, Daddy. Last week when you told Elmo a story, you said that everybody on Sesame Street were happy circus clowns. Well, uh, you are right, Elmo, but this is a different story. Aha! So it is just a story. Oh, so pretend! People weren't really unfriendly on Sesame Street. Well, you know, Elmo, even though a story is pretend, you can still learn something from it. You just have to listen closely. Oh, okay. Elmo will listen closely. Okay. Now, where was I? Oh, right, right. Ahem. Uh, Grover's great-great grandmonster said... What? They don't like welcome mats? No. This is Sesame Street, the unfriendliest street in town! Oh, I do not think that could be true. I live only a few short blocks from here, and everyone there is very kind. That may be so, but if you want a warm welcome or a nice howdy-doo, then Sesame Street isn't for you. Hey. You know what? That rhymes. - It's not intentional! - Oh, sorry. You see, here, the crabs are extra crabby. Hey! Get off of my beach! The cows are super bossy. Mooove! Oh, I'm sorry to-- ow! Not even those guys get along. ( speaking gibberish ) Wow! You are right, sir. This is one unfriendly street. - I told you. - But... ( sniffs ) Hark! - ( both sniffing ) - What is that delicious smell I am smelling? Well, we do have one of the finest cookie shops in the world. Ahh. Cookies! ( sniffing ) - Good luck, pal! - Thank you, sir! I was being sarcastic. ♪ Dum, dee, dum ♪ ♪ Dum, dee, dum, dee, dum. ♪ Ahh. Ah. Hello there! Wow! Those cookies smell delicious. Oh, thank you very much. Uh, they me Nana Monster's special recipe-- chocolate chippies. Yeah. Look. Me also make double chocolate chippies. ( smacks lips ) My goodness! My mouth is watering already. - But that's not all! - Not all? Me also have triple chocolate chippies. Oh. ( sniffs ) Oh, my, my, my goodness! How does a monster ever decide? Hmm. Ahh. I will take one each of your Nana Monster's yummy chocolate chip cookies, please. Uh, no. But you will not sell me the cookies? Of course not. Cookies for me! Ahh nom nom nom! Ahh! - But-- - Oh, yum, oh, yum, yum. Nom nom nom! ( burps ) Excuse me. - ( bell ringing ) - Elmo: Wow! Sesame Street sure was a strange place. You can say that again. Cookie Monster not sharing his cookies? Boy, they all seem so unfriendly. Why wasn't anybody nice, Daddy? Well, it's never just one reason. In the end, I guess you could say that people just weren't kind to each other, and since there was no kindness, there was no celebrating holidays on Sesame Street. No celebrating holidays? Mm-mm. No Hanukkah, no Kwanzaa, and no Christmas. Wha? No Christmas?! And no Santa. Wait a minute. - Santa didn't come to Sesame Street? - Yeah, that's right. Santa only visits places where people are friendly, but back then... There's one place we don't need to stop. Louie: All of Sesame Street was on Santa's naughty list. So, Santa never visited Sesame Street? Mm-mm. So, of course, no one left out any Christmas cookies either. Well, Elmo knows it's just a story, but, well, Santa comes to Sesame Street now. Oh, and everybody here is kind, so-- so how did Sesame Street change? Well, like a lot of things, the change started because of one person. Oh, who? Your great-great grandmonster Elmo. Oh! Oh, the one that Elmo's named after? Ha ha! That's right! He was a lot like you. - Ha ha ha! - Heh heh heh! And when he moved to Sesame Street... - Elmo: Yeah? - ...he was just a little monster, too. Whoa, oh, oh! Look at all the buildings. Ohh! Ha ha! There it is. That's the address-- 123 Sesame Street, our new home. - Oh, oh, oh! - What do you think, son? Oh, boy! Elmo's gonna love it here. - Oh, but, Daddy. - Hmm? Well, where are all the Christmas decorations? Huh. You're right. There aren't any. Well, maybe-- maybe on Sesame Street everybody only hangs them on the inside of their houses. Ha ha! Maybe they do. Tell you what. While I start unpacking, why don't you have a look around, see if you can make some new friends? - Oh, okay, Daddy. - All right. ♪ Do do do. ♪ Oh! Oh, oh, oh! Merry Christmas! Don't talk to him. Let's go. Huh? Boy, maybe they were in a hurry. Oh, Merry Christmas, Officer. Oh! Stop talking nonsense and keep moving, son, and try not to be so cheery. Wha? "Merry Christmas." Kids these days! - ( ball bouncing ) - Where did it go? That's weird. It was just here. - Whoa! - Hey! Hi. Merry Christmas! Merry whos-its? Boy, what is it with this street? Hasn't anybody heard of Christmas? Wait. Who's-- who's Christmas? Christmas isn't a person. It's-- it's when Santa comes! Who? Santa? You know Santa Claus? He-- he wears a big, red suit and comes down your chimney. Ah, yeah a sneak thief. We got those. They come in, take your stuff. No! No. Santa doesn't take things, silly. Oh. He gives presents to everybody who's kind. Ah. Well, no wonder I never heard of him. No one's kind around this street. So, uh, see you. Wait a minute, wait a minute! You've found Elmo's ball! Hey, hey! Well, who's Elmo? Elmo's Elmo. Okay, this is a little confusing, and anyway, I think you're a little mixed up because, uh, this here's my ball. Oh. Ha ha! No. It's-- it's Elmo's ball. See? There's an "E" right on the side, right there. Uh, yeah. Well, uh-- uh, that's not an "E." That's, um-- that's a smudge. - Huh? - Yeah, and, uh, my name is Smudge. Yeah. That's what people call me-- Smudge. Well, it's not very kind to keep somebody's ball, Smudge. - Huh? Who's Smudge? - You are, remember? Uh, yeah, that's right. Boy, how does Smudge have any friends if Smudge won't share? Well, I don't have any friends. All the other kids just take your stuff. Hang on! Elmo has a great idea! It's Christmas Eve. You keep the ball. - What? - Merry Christmas, Smudge. Hey. What's wrong with it? Wait a minute. Did you see that flash? Yeah, yeah. So, what's the big deal? I mean, what are you up to, trying to give me this ball? Oh, nothing. Elmo's just trying to be kind. - Huh? - It's a Christmas gift. Ha ha! Wha? There it is again! Oh, it came from over there. Come on, Smudge! Let's go look! Wait. Hey, listen. I think you're up to something. I mean, why aren't you trying to get this ball back? I mean, uh-- I mean my ball and not back. Huh? It's mine. Om, okay. Well, Merry Christmas. Yeah? Yeah, well, good luck finding your ball! ( bells jingling ) Wow! What is this place? Wow! Oh! Wow! Ha ha ha! Oh, oh! Hello! Is-- is anybody home? ( gasps ) Oh, sunshine! Oh, isn't it amazing? Holly, look? Oh! - Oh, it's so good to get some fresh air in here. - Ha ha hee hee! - Oh, hello. - Hi. Hi. I'm Bella. Nice to meet you. Welcome. Oh! Maybe you can tell me. What day is it? Oh, well, it's-- it's Christmas Eve! Christmas Eve? Christmas Eve! Holly, do you hear that? Oh, it's the most magicalest eve before the most magicalest day of the year! - Yeah! - Holly, Holly, there really is hope this year. I feel it. Do you feel it? Huh? Oh! I feel my back. Oh, I've got a kink in my cogs. Oh. I've got a hunch today could be the day. - ( bell ringing ) - Elmo: Wait a minute. Elmo doesn't understand. What's Bella talking about, Daddy? What does Bella mean, "Today could be the day"? Oh, well, Elmo, this shop was a very special shop. It only appeared when someone on Sesame Street shared the holiday spirit. Oh. Oh, like great-great grandmonster Elmo? - Ha ha! That's right! - Ha ha hee hee! He had the spirit and so did Bella, but they were just about the only ones. Hmm. Hang on. Let me try something. Okay. Merry Christmas! Elmo: Oh. Okay. Elmo, help me. Say Merry Christmas along with me, okay? - Oh, sure! - Okay. Ready? - Uh-huh. - One, two, three! Both: Merry Christmas! Sorry. Not a light. Yeah. Holly's never wrong. Well, wrong about what? Oh, the holiday spirit. It really lights her up, and if there's enough holiday spirit, do you know who will come? - ( gasps ) Santa? - That's right! But not until all five of my lights are lit. And look! Not even one. But, Holly, I'm sure Elmo can help light up all your lights. - Yeah! - But how? - Well, that's a good question. - Hmm. Well, I know to bring holiday spirit, a lot of people decorate to brighten things up, but-- Oh, oh, oh! Then that's what Elmo's gonna do! - Holiday, holi-yay! - Yay! Oh, and Elmo knows where to get help! - You do? - Oh, sure. Oh, Elmo just made a new friend. Oh, stay right here. Be right back. - Bella: Okay. - Holly: Oh! Oh, Smudge, Smudge, Smudge! Oh, yeah, that's me. Hey. Hi! Oh, Elmo and Smudge have to raise the holiday spirit! Oh, that way, Santa will come to Sesame Street. Yeah. Well, you know, I been thinking about that. There ain't no way you're gonna get that guy to come here. Well, why not? Well, for one thing, someone would probably steal his horses. - Reindeer. - Huh? Reindeer. Santa flies in a magical sleigh pulled by eight reindeer. Okay. You know, now I know you're putting me on. You know, is this some big joke, right? No. No, Smudge! See, Holly said if we light up all of her lights, then Santa will come. What? Who says? Oh, oh. Holly. You know, Holly and Bella. They run the curiosity shop. Okay. What curiosity shop? Oh. Oh, well, it's right over here. Come on, Smudge! Elmo will introduce you. ( sighs ) Sheesh. Yeah. That's really weird. It-- it was just here. It was like new. Yeah, yeah, and I guess it just got all magically rundown and all, eh? - ( bell ringing ) - Elmo: Wait a minute, wait a minute. Hold the phone. What happened to Bella and Holly? Why weren't they there anymore? I guess the holiday spirit was too low. Tsk, tsk, tsk. So, it was hopeless? There was nothing they could do? Well, not exactly because great-great grandmonster Elmo kept thinking. Bella said there was a way to bring the holiday spirit to Sesame Street. Oh, yeah. Bella. Is that the invisible lady in the invisible shop? What did she say? Oh, listen. Forget about it! You may try, but you're never gonna get that guy here. - Who? - Sandy. - Santa - Whatever. Let me give you a piece of advice. Lookit. Don't go trying to bring the holidays here. You seem like a bright guy. Bright! That's it! - Uh, what's it? - Th-that's what Bella said! Decorations would brighten everything up! Hmm. What decorations? Oh! The decorations we can put up right-- boy, you know you're right. What decorations? Elmo and Smudge don't have any. Grover: Oddments, carry-alls, bric-a-brac! Hey! Maybe he has what we need. It is I, your fuzzy and adorable and downtrodden salesmonster. If you don't want it, I got it. Excuse Elmo. Oh. No, I am sorry little, red fellow, but I do not have any "keep off the grass" signs or doormats that say, "go away." But Elmo isn't looking for those things. - You aren't? - No. Elmo's looking for decorations. Decorations? I must not be on Sesame Street anymore. No, no. This is Sesame Street. Huh. Well, because you asked, I actually do have a cart full of decorations. - Really? - Really. I loaded them up because today is Christmas Eve. Then I came here. Oh, oh, oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy! But, pray tell, why are you interested in decorations? Well, Elmo thought that if we put up decorations, we might bring some holiday spirit to Sesame Street! That is a great idea! And for you, my friend, I will let you have all the decorations you want for a song. - Oh, oh, oh! - Uh, how much? No. Literally, I will let you have them for a song.

Ah, ah, ah. Let me finish. You know, this is the most unfriendliest street-- D-d-did you see that? What? Something happen behind me? T-t-t-the shop! - Eh? - Ha ha ha! What? Is it the one you were talking about? - Yep! - Uh, zowie! Yeah! Oh, come on! Let's go see if Holly's lit up. Yeah, yeah, let's go, let's go. Wow. I-- I gotta be dreaming! Elmo told you it was real! I just can't believe it! Wow! Would you look at the street? Oh, it's so festive. Oh, oh. Wait a minute. Huh? - Mm-mm-mm. - ( Holly snoring ) Oh. Well, what's that? It's a menorah. It's a symbol of the holiday Hanukkah. What? Another holiday? Oh, yes. The holiday season is full of holidays. Hanukkah is a festival of lights. For eight days, we light a candle to remember a time long ago. - Oh! Cool! - Bella: Yeah! - Big Bird: Elmo! - Come on, Smudge! Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Elmo! - Ha ha hee! - There you are! Oh, Elmo, it looks like you brought some friends. Oh, yeah. They helped Elmo decorate. Oh, this is Grover, and that's Big Bird! Hi! I'm Bella. Hang on. Uh, where did you come from? Oh, everywhere and nowhere. All: Huh? Well, you could say it's our job to give the holiday spirit a boost. Ugh, ugh. What's going on here? And this is Holly. Holly, look at you! ( gasps ) Will you look at that? I've got one, two lights on! Wow! Grover: Ooh! Well, wait a minute. Now there's only one light. It happens. The decorations are nice, but as you can see by my lights, the holiday spirit hasn't gone up much. - Hmm? - ( both sighing ) - Holly: Hmm. - But, hey, you got one light. I didn't even think you'd get that. Don't be too hard on yourselves. Yeah, but how are we gonna get Santa to Sesame Street? Ooh. Santa's going to start flying soon. It's going to be hard raising that much spirit in time. - ( bell ringing ) - Elmo: Hold on a second. All: Hmm? This isn't fair! Well, I guess it's a good thing your great-great grandmonster wasn't one to give up even though things seemed difficult. Oh, well, what did he do, Daddy? What did he do? Ha ha! Well, it was at that moment that something caught their attention. Ladies and gentlemen, may we have your attention? Right this way, right this way! Yes, yes! My old buddy Ernie and I are traveling performers! Wait a second, Bert! I thought you said we were performing travelers! - What? - That's what I printed on my business cards and everything.

Well, maybe more of Holly's lights will go on if Elmo and his friends sing a Christmas song. But you heard what the constable just said. No singing on Sesame Street. Well, Elmo has an idea about that, too, but we're all gonna have to work together, everybody, okay? - All right, all right. - Yeah. Now, here's what we're gonna do. First, we're gonna...

What are you doing? Go, go, go. Constable: I can't see a thing. That is because we have not put the cheese in yet, sir. Let us start with the muenster. We'll work up to a brie. Excellent choice.

I'm starting to get the feeling there's something fishy going on here. I ought to run you in right now, but I'll let you off with a warning. Well, that's awful nice of you, Dad. Oh, don't mention it. See you at home. - Oh. - Be careful crossing the street! Yeah, yeah, yeah. Did I just do something kind? Brr! Whoa! That was a close one. - Bella: Yoo-hoo! - Whoa! Merry Christmas! Oh, wow! Would you look at all those happy faces? There's something happening in this town. - Oh, yeah! - And look. Hmm? Oh, wow! Another one of my lights is lit. Isn't that great? Oh, um, Holly, you seem a little-- Lit up? The holiday spirit really, um, fills Holly. Holiday, holi-yay, right? ( all cheering ) - Oh. - Hey. What happened? There were three lights. - I saw! - Yeah. Did we do something wrong? We put up decorations and sang a delightful seasonal song. You guys did great, and you should be super proud of yourselves, but officially, all of holly's lights have to be lit up in order for Santa to come. And now I only have two. ( all groaning ) - ( bell ringing ) - Elmo: Wait a minute, Daddy. Stop the story, stop the story. Boy, Elmo doesn't understand. They tried so hard. Well, Elmo, sometimes, things work out different than you want them to. You know, Daddy, Elmo's got to tell you this is not a very happy Christmas story to be telling a little monster on Christmas Eve, okay? Besides, you haven't even told Elmo why we leave cookies for Santa. Ha ha! I'm getting there, son. Besides, it's not over yet because as they were wondering what to do next... All: Hmm. - Oh, Bella! - All: Wha? Eh, I bet they're gone for good this time. Maybe we should give up. You could be right. It is too difficult to bring this kind of holiday spirit to Sesame Street. My little body cannot take it anymore. Well, at least we tried. Bye. Good-bye. Ernie: Bye-bye. Eh, I knew it was too good to be true, but, uh, you know, I got to hand it to you-- hey, Elmo. You listening? Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, Smudge. - Elmo's just wondering. - Hmm? Why were there two lights on at all? I don't know. I thought it was because of the singing and the decorations. Well, yeah, that's what Elmo thought, too, but now Elmo's not so sure. Hmm. Maybe those things aren't really what's making Holly light up. What could it be, Smudge? Uh, I don't know. Hey. Uh, hey, Elmo. Uh, you think about it, all right? Um, I'm gonna be right back. Yeah. Okay. ( sighs ) ( all laughing ) Hope everyone is having a yucky Crankymas. Worst Crankymas ever! Everybody, raise a glass of sludge. I just want to say the best thing about Crankymas is-- is the special grouchy feeling I get inside. ( both grunt ) Now we can all say, "scram," or, "have a rotten day," just one day a year, but I say why not try to make every day Crankymas? - Every day! - Oh, yeah! Because, my fellow grouches, Crankymas isn't just a day, cranky is a feeling that comes from deep inside, so let's be cranky all year round. Cheers! Yucky Crankymas! Yucky Crankymas! - And a horrible New Year! - Oh, ho! Heh heh heh! Grouch #2: Oh, many grouchy returns! ( all laughing ) Grouch: Can I get the recipe? Boy, we did all that decorating, sang all those songs, and the only real holiday on Sesame Street is Crankymas. ( sighs ) Oh, what's the use? Hey, uh, Elmo. Yeah? Well, this is a little hard to say. Um, well, I don't have a Christmas present, but, um, this is for you. You're giving Elmo his ball back? Well, uh, I shouldn't have taken it in the first place, and anyway, I figure if I give it back to you, then, uh, we could play together, you know, you and me. Wha? You're a really good friend. Ha ha ha ha! Well, uh, anyhoo, I just wanted you to know what you did today really meant something, and, uh, Merry Christmas, Elmo. Wha? Oh, ho ho ho! Merry Christmas, Smudge. Uh, yeah. Um, my name's Becky. Wha? Ha ha ha! - Well, Merry Christmas, Becky. - Ha! Merry Christmas. Whoa! Did-- did you see that? Yeah! Oh, that happened when Elmo gave you his ball. Oh. Hey.

Looks like it belongs here. - Heh heh. - All: Aww. Good job, guys! - Those were really kind things you did. - All: Aww. And kindness is what the holiday spirit is all about. Would you look at that? She's really lit! Yeah! Hey! Holly has four lights now. Guys, this is amazing. Yeah! ( sleigh bells ringing ) Look. Up in the sky! Elmo: That's Santa! - Grover: Santa? - It is. It is Santa! - Santa, Santa! - Come on, guys! Come look. - Oh, yeah. I see him. - Yes! Look. It's Santa! Look. There he is. - Aww. - All: Aww. Santa, he flew right past Sesame Street. I suppose it is because we could not get all of Holly's lights to light up. Uh, hey. Hey. You guys tried, you know, and look. Sesame Street's, like, the friendliest street around now. I mean, who'd have thunk, huh? - Yeah. - Oh, that's true. What more could anyone ask for? Wow! Everybody so kind. You know what? Me want to try this kindness thing. Uh, here. Have a cookie. All: Have a cookie?! Cookie Monster, are you sharing your cookies now? That right. Merry Christmas, everybody. Oh, wow! Yeah, here. Take a cookie. Take a chocolate chippie. Look! What? What's happening? Oh, look! All five of my lights are lit! That's five, five festive lights. Ah ah ah! ( organ playing, thunder ) ( all cheering ) You did it, Cookie Monster! You made all of Holly's lights light up! - Yeah! - Oh, wow! Me not know what that mean, but that terrific! Yeah! Ha ha ha! Oh, but it is too late for Santa to come now. He flew by. - ( bell ringing ) - Elmo: No, no, no, no, no. This can't be! Too late for Santa? Yeah, it's true, but you wanted to know why we leave cookies out for Santa. It's to remember Cookie Monster's kind act. So, you're saying Santa never came? Oh, I didn't exactly say that. Well, because at that very moment in Santa's sleigh... What's happening? Uh, there must be some type of mistake on the grid, sir. We really are on a tight schedule, though, so if we could just stay straight. Well, it looks like a new stop. Yeah, right, but it's much too far behind us now. We-- we couldn't possibly turn in time-- Wind or gale, we can make an exception for any street that glows that bright. - Yes, sir. - Dancer, Prancer, about turn! To Sesame Street! - Ho ho ho ho! - Hoo hoo hoo! Oh! Oh, hey! Look, look, look! It's Santa! Oh! He's coming back! Hey! ( sleigh whooshes ) Girl: Oh! Oh! - It is him! - Ah ah ah! Yeah. ( all cheering ) Girl: Hi, Santa! - Becky: Santa! - Merry Christmas, everyone. - Ho ho ho ho! - Merry Christmas! Look, everybody! Santa came here! - Uh, you're Santa Claus, right? - That's right. The holiday spirit here is so great at Sesame Street. I wouldn't miss it for the world. All: Aww. Well, I'll tell you what, it was all his doing. Yeah. Elmo. It was his idea. Uh, uh, uh... Is that right? Well, it's nice to meet you, Elmo. ( gulps ) Ha ha! Ha ha hee! Hi, Santa. Ha ha ha! Ha ha. Yeah, he's a bit nervous, you know? Anyway, it was his idea to help bring the holiday spirit to Sesame Street, and, well, I guess all of us kind of pitched in, right? - Well, you could say that. - Yeah, right. It's so wonderful to meet someone who believes so much in the holidays, Elmo. Oh, well, thank you, Santa. Ha ha ha! And then there was this Bella lady who taught us about the holiday spirit. Bella: Yoo-hoo! Hello, Mr. Claus. Well, I should have known you would be here. Now where's Holly? Ooh! Uh, right here! I haven't seen you in forever, not since Grumpy Falls. It's true. We didn't much luck raising holiday spirit, not until this little monster came along. Well, you all gave the greatest gift of all-- kindness. All: Aww. And I've got a gift for everyone here, even you, Grover. Oh, boy! This is for Rosa. I must admit we were right to stop here, sir. Look at that. That's so nice. - Here you go. - Becky: Oh, thanks. This is for Grover. - Ohh. - ( rattling ) Ohh. Oh, hey, Bert, can you believe it? This Christmas just keeps getting better. It's snowing. Snowing? Ernie, that's impossible. It can't be snowing. Oh, sure it can, Bert. Right up there. Look. Do you see the snow now, Bert? - ( sighs ) - Heh heh heh! - Wha? - Good-bye, Elmo. - Is Bella leaving? - That's right. Holly and I are off to the next town that needs some holiday spirit, but thank you. We couldn't have done it without you. That's right. Well, Elmo's gonna miss you. Aw. We'll miss you, too, Elmo. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Hee hee hee! Oh, Santa, uh, me want to thank you for coming to Sesame Street. Oh. Well, what is this? Uh, that a cookie. A cookie? Yeah, yeah. A very special recipe. Oh, well. Mmm. Yum. This is something I could get used to. Yeah, but, uh, Santa, that not quite how you eat it. - It's not? - Uh-uh. Observe. Ahh, nom nom nom nom nom nom nom! - Ho ho! - Nom nom nom nom nom. I like the way you do that. - Thank you. - I'm writing a song. Really? "C is for"-- I can't think of the next one. "C is for"-- hmm. No. "C is for hmm" isn't right. - Cucumber. - Cucumber! - No. - No. "C" is for cookie, but that good enough for me, so me not sure about you. - No. It's not good enough for Santa. - Oh, boy. This a toughie. Louie: And ever since that Christmas Eve long, long ago, we leave cookies out for Santa. A little to the right. No. A little to the left. Wait, wait, wait, wait! Both: Perfect! Oh! Ha ha ha! Louie: And how Sesame Street became known as the friendliest street in the world. Ah. There goes the neighborhood. Eh. The end. Merry Christmas, Elmo. Heh heh.
