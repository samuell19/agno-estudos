In our little town nothing very much happens. People go about their business... ...the days get longer or shorter... ...the seasons come and go. Nothing, unusual. Till suddenly in the winter of 1891 a number of extraordinary things happened... ...which turned the town upside down. It all began with the suicide of the young student Mr. Karlsen. He slashed his wrists, like a fool. Because he was rejected by Dany Kielland... ...the vicar's beautiful daughter. Immediately afterwards... ...a strange man appeared who said his name was Johan Nagel. He was carrying a violin case, like a gypsy. But he was no gypsy - we saw that straightaway. Johan Nagel had no reason to come to our town. He had no business to transact there... ...and he hadn't come visiting friends or relations... ...for he knew nobody at all. If you ask me... ...his visit was somehow connected with the death of young Karlsen. Had Karlsen been a friend of his? Had he perhaps come to avenge Karlsen's death? Whatever Johan Nagel came to this town for... no one's ever been able to find out, for sure. A room please. Seven... Do the walls keep the noise from the other rooms out? Of course, Sir. The Grec Molin is a very respectable hotel. Good... Thank you. Who are you? Sara's my name. If you wish I could get another room for you. No, no, there's no need, I'm very satisfied with my room. I can see the whole promenade, it's very amusing. I, eh, have to ship a crate of fresh fish. Have you any idea how that can be arranged? No idea. Oh, you look like a seasoned traveler, that's why I thought... No, no. Oh, your business brings you here? No, I'm not a business man. I noticed you had a violin with you. Perhaps you might play for our guests some evening. Yes maybe. By the way you can give me the bill any time you like. I can pay whenever you wish. Oh thank you, thank you. But there's no hurry about it. If you're planning to stay a longer period... ...I could give you a favorable discount. I could be staying. It depends on a few things. I'm an agronomist. A gentleman farmer. Johan Frederick Nagel. So you might be staying the whole winter here? Maybe longer. I saw him near the hotel. He took notice of me. Why? We call him “Minute”. He went round looking at the houses and the streets... ...and the people as if he were examining them. He seemed to discover things that we'd never given a second thought to. The things a man sees clearly on his deathbed. He was looking for something. Whatever it may have been, he didn't find it. Or maybe he was suffering from some incurable disease... ...and had picked out our nondescript little town... ...to come and end his days in, as if he were suddenly consumed... ...by love for everything. He used to carry this bottle of prussic acid about with him... ...90% strong it was. A horrible poison. Later on, the landlord of the Grec Molin Hotel told me... ...that he used to spend hours alone in his room, just moping. And there was a strange light in his eyes, like one possessed. Nagel's mysterious disappearance had the most terrible consequences... ...as if some evil spirit had been let loose amongst us. By now most of us have put these events at the back of our minds... ...all except the two women who treated him so scandalously... ...and betrayed him. Good day. Forgive me Miss, that I've to speak to you, but I'm a stranger here... ...I've lost my way. Where do you want to go? Eh, could you please tell me how far it is to the town? The precise distance? Eh... the precise distance... I can't say exactly. I'm not from here either. If you take that path over there... it is eh... a half hour's walk. Thank you, thank you very much. If you're going that way, would you allow me to accompany you? It's slippery. You've nothing to fear. I won't disturb you. I won't even speak. I'll just walk alongside of you and listen to the birds. Why are you running away? Dammit! Coming! I apologize for being so terribly late. I'm sure you had something very important to do. I was in the graveyard. I was thinking. Then you must have seen the place, where they're burying poor Karlsen tomorrow. The man who was found dead on the Sneafell? Yes... it's a very strange business. He was laying on his belly, with his face in the mud. Yesterday the police discovered a knife - a penknife. He was a very talented young man, according to the newspapers. Yes. He was to become a vicar in a few weeks. He was here on a little holiday. His poor mother lives just around the corner. Did he kill himself? Well, both his wrists were slashed. That's not an accident. With his face in the mud... Tomorrow they're burying him in consecrated ground. But the more I think about the case... It all points to an ordinary love story. Ordinary? How so? He had a piece of paper in his mouth. But that doesn't tell us anything special... he made notes... ...when he was out taking a walk. And what was on it? “'May the steel of your blade cut as sharply as your final 'no'.” What nonsense! Steel...? The penknife belonged to Miss Kielland. Ah, the daughter of... ...of the vicar. But everyone here loves her. Please Sir, what I've just told you is confidential, so I beg you not to... Yes, of course... It's a little island. ...I asked him, what's the fellow been drinking... Dance with me, Minute. Oh, not today please, I'm very busy. I've taken the coal to the kitchen. Would there be anything else sir? What else would there be now? Come! And drink a glass of mothermilk with us, Minute... With pleasure, Inspector. But not now please. Not now? Why not? Can't I offer you a glass of beer? Aren't you the son of a distinguished vicar? There we go! No, you know I can't take strong drink. Drink! There, one sip to please you. Come on, bottoms up! No, please, don't be angry with me. I'll drink it up. I've got no head for it. No head he says! And now, you must gnash your teeth in front of us, Minute. I'm short of time. Short of time!! Hey, it's about time you bought yourself a new coat, Minute. Look at this! What are you doing, my only coat. Don't worry, you'll get a brand new one, Minute, from me... I promise you in front of 1, 2, 4, 6 witnesses. Tomorrow come to my place to fetch your new coat. Yes, but to earn it tonight, you've to gnash your teeth for us. No... No! I? I cannot gnash my teeth. You'll be able to just fine, once you've had a glass of beer. I'll be sick. I'll gnash my teeth. That's what I like to hear. Oh, do stop Inspector, or I shall wet my knickers. Harder, harder gnash!! I cannot do it any harder. I give up. What I want you to do is to taste this delicious drink. Right to the bottom. Here, drink it up. What do you want from me? I've got feelings, like the rest of you. No Inspector, you're going too far. If you break this glass on the head of this bully here... ...I'll protect you from the consequences. What did you say? No please. I said bully. Go to the devil! You goddamned foreigner! I'm not standing any more of this. If you feel like having a fight, go outside - not in here! Shall we get some fresh air? How did you come by that strange nickname? Your real name's Grogard? I was baptized Minute. In church? No, it was at a party... At a party? There was captain Prante, Dr. Kolbey and eh... the customs officer. I forget his name now. It was a bachelors party and they were drunk. And they were running around half naked... Oh not me, because I didn't want to take my clothes off. So they took me and threw me in a barrel of wine. Well, the customs officer, he threw in a broken glass and some ash from the stove... ...and Dr. Kolbey, he emptied the chamberpot into the wine. Then they held me by the feet and plunged me. Head first... seven times into the wine. I thought I was gonna die. I couldn't get any air and... ...then I cried. Stop a minute, stop a minute... ...So captain Prante said: That's it, we'll baptize him Minute. Won't you have a sip of this, Mr. Grogard? Perhaps I will. I had champagne one Christmas. Hmmm, it's nice, I remember it now. I'll never forget what you did for me today. Your father was a vicar, yet you carry coal. Oh, yes, for my uncle. It doesn't bother me. I'm used to it, if that's what you mean. I fell down stairs last year with a sack... ...I had to walk for a whole year with a stick. Do you know a beautiful young woman with chestnut brown hair? There's lots of beautiful women in this town. There is Frederikke. Does she have a red parasol? Oh, no, you mean Miss Kielland, she has one, the only one. Grey-green eyes? Yes... So that was Dany Kielland. Mr. Grogard, come when you like. It was a real pleasure. Don't forget, room 7. A few days later Nagel was in the market and he met a friend of mine. My only friend I might say, called Martha Gude. If God blessed me with another body... ...I would have asked her to marry me long ago. Her hair had turned white from grief. What that grief was, is not for me to say. ...62,000 guilder offer for the land. Sara, Sara. Your eyes are just like forget-me-nots. Why weren't my shoes polished this morning? It's washing day today... Vicar Karlsen. Why did you hide your face like that in the mud? Have you had your new coat yet from the inspector? Not yet, but it'll come. You draw too much attention to yourself... ...look, they're looking at us now. They asked me about you. Who's that blond woman? Oh, that's Frederikke. And the girl who's standing starting, next to her? That's Gudrun, her sister. They're both daughters of the Bailiff. I know everybody. And the man with sleepy eyes and the beard - who's looking this way... That's Dr. Stenersen. He got married just last year... ...that's his wife, next to him. She's got asthma. That's why she wears those thick mufflers. There, that's Dany Kielland, the one in black. Oh, silly of me. They're all in black. Sir, I regret having to ask you but would you mind not... ...sitting on that tombstone? I'm asking you in the name of the deceased's sister. My humblest apologies... Just as I expected... ...Nagel went off to the lonely house were Martha lived. Finding she was away from home, he pushed open the door. He was looking for her, for traces of her past life. He saw her when she was young. You have her eyes, but not her gentle face. I wish I could help you. I hope you will excuse me for joining you like this... ...without being introduced to you. Nagel is my name. Mr. Nagel, you couldn't do us a greater pleasure, really. What a pity you don't have your violin with you... ...you could've played a little serenade for us. I don't play the violin. I have an old violin case, full of dirty laundry. Then perhaps you'd like to sing for us. Mr. Nagel, I do hope you haven't made any other plans. We're having a little gathering at our house, tonight... You must come over, Mr. Nagel. But I warn you, at our gatherings there's a minimum of liquor... ...and a maximum of gossip. Would it be all right if I wear these clothes? I'm afraid I have nothing else. Your husband is evidently an experienced hunter. No, everything here comes from my side of the family. No, I'm not mistaken... I was wondering just... ...where have I seen Mr. Nagel before tonight, but now it's just occurred to me... ...at that meeting the other day... ...you made a violent attack on Mr. Gladstone's theories... ...that's interesting! Attacking Gladstone, not while I'm still alive! There must be a misunderstanding. No, certainly not, I remember you saying that Gladstone was a bigot. Maybe our good friend Nagel was drunk at that moment. I'm quite aware, dear Inspector... I owe you my deepest apologies... ...but this is not the moment, do you think? Indeed this is not the right moment. Sometimes the town dignitaries invited Nagel home. The ladies especially. They were bored stiff with their lives. They flirted openly with him... My God, you're beautiful. Nagel was shameless in his wooing of Dany Kielland. She tolerated his advances, so that Nagel... ...Started to imagine he was in love with her. I had the feeling that it would be a fine day today. The first thing that I saw yesterday morning... ...was a beautiful lady who smiled at me. Good health! A daydream like that I wouldn't mind having one like that myself. Oh, but I've experienced more stranger things than that. Please, excuse, I'm talking too much. But that's exactly what we want Mr. Nagel, to hear you talking. We here in the provinces are not used to fine conversation. Well, if you insist then... I saw... ...a rocky landscape... Why are you doing that? So I won't soil your shoes with the blood from my mouth. But why do you want to kiss my shoes, after all I've done to you? To thank you for not making me suffer more, you're very kind to me. What pompous nonsense! It gives me the creeps. I knew it. I knew it. The very moment you said that he kissed the ground... ...I knew it was Minute. You need sleep Mr. Nagel. Are you eating properly? That fellow Karlsen was driven to an early death... ...by overly violent emotions. I mean his nerves were weak which was caused by... ...an unbalanced diet and lack of exercise. It's an emergency. Excuse me. You must all stay as long as you like... You know Mr. Nagel, you really ought to come with me this evening on my round. It's really... eh... terribly discouraging. My patients behave like neurotics... They should all be locked up. One by one. I'll go with you. Oh. Wonderful. And then... the stench... Anyway. Well good night, everyone. Oh, goodbye... Goodbye... Would you like to hear some music, Mr. Nagel? With pleasure. Come on Jetta. Have you noticed how Nagel stands there, posing with that ring of his? You've such a beautiful voice. Mr. Nagel, I hope you will say goodbye to us, before you leave. And you have such a sensitive touch. May I accompany you home? I shall behave like a gentleman. Of course. There's something wrong with the Stenersens. No children, no worries, but yet... You're so different from other men, Mr. Nagel. Why do you tell all of this to me? Because I want you to notice me a little... I haven't spoken a single word, all evening that wasn't really meant for you. Why is the inspector so hostile towards you? Oh, a small misunderstanding. He knocked a glass of beer out of my hands in the “Grec Molin”... ...and I was very rude to him as well... I even threatened him a little, but he has reacted like a real gentleman. I've heard quite a different story. From whom? From Minute. Minute is lying! Why do you always try to abase yourself? May I speak frankly to you? I had really reckoned on someone else, telling you the true story... ...of that incident, yesterday night. I wanted to abase myself at first... in order that later in the true version I would appear to you as a hero. Why do you have to be so calculating? I don't understand you and I've no wish to understand you. This is the spot where I first met you! I shall never forget how you looked that day... ...like a princess. Yes... But I'd like to tell you about a true adventure I once had... It won't take long. I found myself in the country walking for several hours... Something kept me from turning back... ...and drove me on... Suddenly heard someone calling my name, “Nagel... Johan Nagel”... Suddenly the little monster disappeared. “Nagel... Johan Nagel...!” Stunned I looked up... then... I heard light footsteps... I turned and saw a beautiful woman coming down the stairs... Come stranger. I looked at her and a happy feeling came over me. Together we walked down a flight of stairs. Again I felt the presence of the little monster. I started dancing. It was as though the roof had been lifted. All of a sudden I heard heavenly music... A myriad of tiny, luminous figures... ...dazzling white, seemed to be descending. They touched my face, my hands. They had no eyes, they were all blind. The whole tower was filled with blind angels singing... The clock struck one. Suddenly the angels stopped singing. I saw them arrange themselves in formation and fly off. The last one turned around, gazing at me with its blind eyes before it departed. That's the last thing I remember. This one blind angel that turned around to look at me. Then everything became black again... Mr. Nagel, may I thank you for a beautiful evening. I'll write to my fiancé that I've met a gentleman... ...who's totally and completely dissatisfied with everyone and everything. And Lt. Hansen is a most understanding man. Goodnight. The days went by. Once more Nagel set off for Martha's house. He wanted to help. How. That was the problem. He thought up something. Good afternoon. I'd like a word or two with you. It won't keep you very long. Nagel's my name. I'm staying at the moment in the “Grec Molin”. I'm a collector of antiques. You may have heard of me. I buy anything that's old, and I pay very good prices. I have no antiques. Everyone says that. Only most people don't know what they really have. That chair for example, could I look at it more closely? Two of the legs are broken, that's why I put it against the wall. Yes, but is that important? May I ask you where it comes from? Somewhere abroad. My father used to collect chairs on his travels. He was a sailor. And you weren't with him, I imagine. Yes... Good, what's your price? Let me decide what's a fair price. You'd ask an astronomical amount. You might ask 300 guilders and - excuse me for saying so - ...that's outrageous. 200 guilders, not a cent more. If you're... if you really want this chair for your collection... ...please have it. I have no use for it. I'll bring it to your hotel if you like. Such a proposal has never been made to me before. My dear Miss Gude, 200 guilders and two days to think it over. But give me your solemn promise you won't sell it... ...to anyone else in the meantime... Martha was confused. She was not used to people treating her well. Nor am I, so I became very embarrassed indeed, when Nagel... ...without telling me, visited Hansen's, the tailor's. The manager please. Nobody has ever been so good to me! Could you make a jacket of that material and have it delivered to Mr. Grogard? Certainly... ...would you mind coming over to the light, please. Is it for Minute? Yes, but it absolutely must be ready tomorrow evening. But the measurements. Yes of course. Minute has a very special... Size... Oh I'm sure, we can manage that. I assume it's enough. One day my friend was visited by a figure from the past... An elegant lady from the big city... Her name was Kamma. She once had been his greatest lover. He told me later, that seeing her again was like receiving... ...a blow between the eyes. There is a lady downstairs who wishes to speak to you. Ah, and who may this lady be? Sara, I think they are calling for you downstairs. Another glass, please. - How do you like it? - Very elegant. I met the inspector, but he gave nothing away. “Where did you get the new jacket?” he said. He was testing me out, wasn't he? What did you say? I said I mustn't... tell. Now a jacket also demands a new shirt. This shirt is still good. I know how to treat shirts. I take them off at night. I sleep naked, but they last twice as long. Lieutenant Hansen promised me two of his shirts. New trousers then, a gift from me, agreed? Little she-devil. Kamma really loved him, I think. She loved his money too. I'm not surprised at all that you take advantage of my being silent... ...to walk away. You are quite right... I've been drinking too much. I'm very nervous. Please, stay a little while. I'm not going home vet, Mr. Nagel. What were you saying? Oh yes, you were telling me about that stag party, you know? When they baptized you. I really ought to have a little party of my own, for a few friends. You, you to begin with... Dr. Stenersen... ...our student Quinn and naturally the inspector. Have I forgotten anyone? You don't have to be afraid. You will be treated with the utmost respect. I guarantee it personally. Come closer, we're being overheard. Grogard... What's your opinion of Dany Kielland? Wait, I'll tell you what I think of her. Dany Kielland is able to destroy as many men as she wants. That's my humble opinion. She's so unattainable. So beautiful and out of reach. It must be so exquisite to be destroyed by her. But you've said... Lies, Minute. I'm hopelessly in love with her. She's engaged to someone else and lost to me. I don't pity her for being lost. I pity myself. I could weep, Minute. My friend wept... ...and I could not comfort him. She could - Dany Kielland apparently could... Nagel latched onto her, he imagined this frivolous and vain creature possessed... ...of all kinds of charms and virtues... ...that existed only in his fevered brain. This is the fifth time we meet. If only you knew, how I looked forward to this moment. I hope that you do not regret the last time we met. Forgive me for saying so, but I'm not sure you're in your right mind. Have you been drinking? Yes, it's my birthday today. Well, I think it's a shame that you picked this way to celebrate it. I'm a walking contradiction. I've said nauseating things about you, only out of love then. I've tried to humiliate you, only to console myself a little. But I glow inside when I see you. I always take this path, hoping to find your footprints in the wet sand. I pray to the wind and the stars to kiss you goodnight in my name. You belong to another man, I know. I tell myself... ...she's engaged, leave her alone, she will go away... ...but then later on I say... ...she's still here, she's not lost to me yet. Say something, please. You're losing a button, have you anything to cut the thread? Ah, what's that medal for? Life-saving. Actually I have no right to wear it. Don't belittle yourself. No, I bought it. Take a look, the name has been scratched out. I love you. You're really crazy. And you're driving me crazy too. I don't want to see you again. This can't be the last rendezvous. Say it isn't, even if you don't mean it, really. It is my birthday, isn't it? Kindly go away now, please. And don't you come looking for me at the rectory. The dog will bark all night and my father has had to get up three times at least. Good evening gentlemen, excuse me for being late, I tore my hand on a fishhook. Mr. Grogard has a new outfit I see? And the inspector hasn't even turned up. No, if you asked me to choose now, between Tolstoy... ...Jesus Christ and Emmanuel Kant... ...I should find it extremely difficult to answer. Ha, ha, you couldn't even start. What's Mr. Nagel's opinion? Eh... eh, in my opinion... ...those who make the most money are the greatest. But you cannot deny that Tolstoy is a great writer. Tolstoy is terribly naive. His whole teaching is not better than of the Salvation Army's. To your health, gentlemen. Your air of superiority is insulting. Tolstoy has proved himself a true friend of the poor and the oppressed. Whoever attacks Tolstoy will have to deal with me. Giving away a few rubles, when you have millions, is totally meaningless. Some people can't help giving money away. Why? Because they get satisfaction from it. It brings tears to their eyes. Do I have to admire that? Nagel, you're a reactionary, there. I am, and always will be, a liberal. If by “liberal” you mean you judge the whole world by scientific criteria... ...I'm afraid to confess that I am indeed a reactionary. Life's dreams, its mysteries, are those greatest treasures of man... Share with mankind... There's one solution for the world. We shall kill ourselves. Yes, I've thought like that, but I haven't the courage... Though my pistol is always loaded. What do you think, doctor? Prussic acid 90%. Is that enough to give mankind its send-off? I tried it on an animal once, it really works wonders. Actually I ought to confiscate that weapon of yours... ...but as you yourself say, you haven't the courage to use it. Grogard. Dear friend, you are spending your vacation writing a novel? You must have a fancy for literature in that warm heart of yours. Please, allow me to recite the following masterpiece for you. “'May the steel of your blade cut as sharply, as your final no.” Guy de Maupassant. When he felt relaxed, Nagel was the cheeriest of fellows... His birthday party was a joyous affair. A fine jacket like that deserves a waistcoat. Try it, take it home with you, you may keep it. All right, let's smash all the glasses now. Is that you Grogard? What time is it? It's not eight o'clock yet, Mr. Nagel. I found these things in your waistcoat. I hope you didn't drink the poison, did you? No, I didn't touch it. Not even tasted it? I promise. I hope your hand gets better soon. He had hurt his hand. I know where he got it. I'm not a fool. For last night I had not heard Dany Kielland's dog bark once! I'm not really educated enough to understand the mind of someone like Nagel. So I stood by and looked on helplessly as he was torn between... ...the most conflicting emotions. I could see that Nagel was trying to run away from himself. He, who was so subtle and clearsighted in other things... ...how could he think that possible. Even I know that I cannot escape from this deformed infant's body of mine. Mr. Nagel, you've a visitor, Miss Kielland is waiting downstairs. What a lovely surprise this is. I had the feeling today would be a lovely day for me. Our dog is dead. Really? The housekeeper found him this morning. I must admit that I never really cared for that dog. Forgive me for saying so, but that creature's expression... ...was particularly disgusting. He looked as if the whole suffering of mankind was your fault. He bit me as well. Mr. Nagel you should be ashamed. You promised me to stop this stupid behavior. Mr. Nagel, you must stop this. I love somebody else. Well, is that clear? I am a scoundrel. If you wish you can accompany me home, now. I once had a friend who was hopelessly in love with a certain Clara. But Clara didn't want to have anything to do with him. She also had a sister, a monstrous creature, a hunchback. One day my friend suddenly fell in love with... Why do you always do your best to keep the conversation going? Why are you so nervous? Show me your hand. Does it hurt? Now, listen to me. I hope you never suffer as I am suffering now. Scoundrel! Don't you recognize me? Johan Nagel. I see you haven't sold the chair yet. No, there was another person, a lady... ...but you can have it for nothing. Now, Miss Gude, please don't make me angry. Next thing you'll ask 500 guilders for it. What sort of game are you playing? I'm not playing any. Please give me three guilders. That's settled then. Forgive me, please. Do you know Minute? Please don't talk to me about him. Did you know he is hopelessly in love with you? Oh, but we've known each other since we were children. I'm not surprised then, but he's got courage. At his age and deformed as he is. Please. You shake your head. So unreliable women are. You've given me too much. Are you starting that again? You give me too much. Well, give it back. Would you do me the honor... ...tonight of coming with me to the fancy fair in town? A bit of music, fun, will do you good. I've got nothing to wear. Now you've money enough. You can buy what you want. Perhaps. Thank you for asking me. It's been years since. The day of the annual fancy fair came around. I was really nervous, I had to appear in one of the tableaux as the god Pan. When Dany Kielland went off to dress up for her appearance as a heathen goddess... ...I saw Nagel follow her with burning eyes. Excuse me, please. Why are you so interested in a coat, when its owner leave you cold? A little investigation. I'm beginning to distrust you... ...so that even your broad shoulders appear suspicious. That's the reason I wanted to see if you wore shoulder-paddings inside your coat. You're quite right. I am a scoundrel. I give cigars out to little boys in the streets. I annoy the chambermaid of “The Grec Molin”. And I've a disease that's incurable. I'm quite ridiculous. Well, for once you're telling the truth. You're not leaving your charming guest alone for too long? You know very well I only came tonight to see you. Mr. Nagel, you're really beginning to bore me. I tell you, I love my fiancé, and I have no intention... ...of breaking my engagement. Miss Kielland, since you won't be seeing me again... ...would you write to your fiancé... ...to remind him that he promised Mr. Grogard two woolen shirts. You are very patient. Are you enjoying yourself a little? Really... Isn't that beautiful? What do you mean? Why? The forest all bloodred. So don't move anymore. Oh. Thank you. Oh. I must go home now. It's already so late. What a pity now. Oh no. It's out of the question. I cannot stay any longer. Then Mr. Nagel will be delighted to accompany you. No, I cannot be seen with Mr. Nagel. Especially on the streets. He has such peculiar ideas. Just recently he intended to make a rendezvous with me in the churchyard. The churchyard? What an original idea. Tell me, Mr. Nagel, what was your idea? Oh come on, Dany. You know perfectly well Miss Kielland. Mr. Nagel even poisoned our dog. ...and by the way...his name is really Simonsen, just Simonsen. May I. Bravo... Good lord. You do play after all. He likes a good joke. I'm only an amateur. Thank you for inviting me to take a drink with you in your hotel. But I was on duty. Thank you nevertheless. I had tears in my eyes. Not because he played so beautifully... ...but because in the music... ...I could hear my friend's wounded soul crying out. May I come in? Isn't it rather late? I must talk to you. May I hold your hand a while? Do you also think I'm always lying? Oh no. Of course not. And what if I told you that I love you. Please do understand. I am asking you to become my wife... ...not my mistress, but my lawful wife. I know what you're thinking, you're a couple of years older than me... ...does that matter? If you were 30 years older than me, it would make no difference... ...only you don't think it's possible? Yes, no. Let's not talk about it anymore. You think that I'm joking, don't you? Not that. Is it because of Minute? Oh no. I'll always be good to you. I'll buy a house for us, a piece of land. I'm an agronomist... you see, I have very strong hands, we shall always be together. Yes... We'll go fishing together and swimming in the brook. Would you like that? Yes... Minute might be very jealous. I cannot help that. I'll think about you all night. Will you come and see me tomorrow morning? Yes. Tomorrow is good. Shall I wear the same dress? Yes... It's raining, you'll get wet. One thing more. You didn't think I was rich did you? No... Mr. Nagel, you must forgive me, I thought it over carefully. I know I promised you yesterday, but I'm afraid it's not possible. Not possible? I do not love you enough. Do I suddenly repulse you? It's not possible. Dany. What did Miss Kielland tell you? I didn't say Miss Kielland had been here. Listen. Trust me. I won't deceive you. I'll come back tomorrow. No... Don't you want to see me again? I... I'd like to see you again... ...after you're married... ...after your house is furnished. I mean, I would like to come and work for you... ...as your maid... ...that's what I want. The cruel way she rejected him wounded Nagel to the marrow. Dany. Like a she-devil, had blackened Nagel's name. Dany. Like a serpent, had spat her venom into Martha's credulous heart. And so Nagel's last chance of attaining happiness and peace was gone. Then something happened I had seen coming from the moment I first met Johan Nagel. Dany I hate you. Goddamned! Who's been at the bottle again? Who? What a beautiful day. Yes, isn't it? Do you want to speak to me? I want to ask a favor. It's embarrassing. I'm not sure you want to do it for me. I'd be only too pleased to help you. I've a brief note for Martha Gude, would you kindly take it to her? I think you know where she is. Martha Gude? I'm really very grateful to you for being so kind. There is no hurry. Who put those flowers over there? I did sir. New curtains, the windows cleaned. Come here. This is for you. What for? For your lovely shoulders. So, you're back at your old job again, I see. And up to your old tricks. You put water in my little bottle. I wanted to do you a good turn. A good turn. A good turn!? Do you know what I think? You and your goodness. You're a deceiver! You let everyone walk over you. You dance for pennies. You sleep naked to save on your shirts. You're like Martha Gude. You're two of a kind... You disgust me. I've had my eye on you... Where were you on the 6th of December? You've no idea why I'm asking you that. Because Karlsen was murdered on the 6th of December and I suspect... ...that you murdered him. Grogard, come back... ...I don't know what I'm saying... Please... Nagel shut himself up in his room. He, who could be so vital and brave... He, who had given me courage in the hours I most needed it. He sat there torturing himself for hours until he was ill. Yes, let me see... ...how much is it in all? Oh, there's not the slightest hurry Mr. Nagel. No... That's all I have. It's not enough, is it? No Mr. Nagel, it's not enough. Look for yourself. In that case, Mr. Nagel, I shall have to call the police. Thousands. Oh, I understand it now. You wanted to see if I could take a joke. Yes, I sometimes play practical jokes. Thank you, Mr. Nagel. May I have a grog with brandy? But you have a fever. Don't you want to get undressed? Undress, in the middle of the day? Then tomorrow the whole town will know I've got undressed. And laugh! I'll go fetch a doctor. No, they'll give me medicine that'll kill me. Karlsen. It's hot here. I have a fishhook in my throat. Sara, what's this hole I'm buried in? The hypocrites. Shall I get that grog with brandy for you? No, then tomorrow the whole town will know I had a brandy. Let me go, let me go. You'll never drown, you're too good a swimmer, you'll come up. I heard someone calling me. I had to do something. And for the first time in his life... ...Minute, the laughingstock, the dwarf, hit back. I was sentenced to three years imprisonment. Not for a single moment did I feel any remorse. Sometimes I see them walking in the town together... ...the two women who were responsible for his death. The white haired one, who killed him out of good faith... ...and the other out of pure frivolity. Both women remained unmarried. I keep thinking again and again about what they told me about Nagel. A lot of it was very new to me. I didn't hear any of it. I left the room. He always walked here. Who? It's slippery. Would you like to take my arm? Yes, but you hold on to me.
