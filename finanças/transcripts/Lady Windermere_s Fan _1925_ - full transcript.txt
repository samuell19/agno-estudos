"LADY WINDERMERE'S FAN" Lady Windermere faced the grave problem-- of seating her dinner guests. Lord Darlington "Lord Darlington." "I presume you came to see my husband." Dear Lord Windemere-- This note from a total stranger may surprise you-- ...but is is important that you see me at once if you would avoid certain... ...unpleasant disclosures. Yours very truly, Edith Erlynne. "Lord Darlington is most anxious to see you." "You don't mind if I run away?" "Lady Windermere, I have a bit of news that might interest you." "I love you!" After a life of adventure abroad, Mrs. Erlynne had drifted to London-- ...her social stranding a thing of the past, the present a problem for her polished wits. "Who are you - and what does this letter mean?" "I am the mother of your wife." "I knew you would doubt me-- here are the proofs of my identity." "You know very well that your daughter was brought up to believe her mother is dead-- ...you also know why!" "She worships her dead mother. The truth would kill her!" Thanks to Windermere's cheques, Mrs. Erlynne lived in extravagant style-- ...not accepted by society but the subject of its gossip. No party of the Windermeres' was complete without Lord Augustus Lorton-- ...London's most distinguished bachelor. The Duchess of Berwick, Lady Plymdale... ...Mrs. Cowper-Cowper-- gossip, gossip, gossip--. "She is getting gray--" "She is quite gray--" "She is perfectly gray." "I wonder where the woman gets all her money?" "Why gossip about a woman you have never met? ... ...She may be very nice." "I cannot understand why your husband defends the woman!" A gentleman's relation to a lady is indicated by the manner... ...in which he rings her doorbell. But when the relation becomes more friendly-- "What right have you to be jealous? You don't love me." "If you really loved me, you would marry me... ...in spite of what society might say--" "I am sorry my maid forgot to empty the ash tray... ...but it happens even in society." Lady Windermere's birthday dawned radiantly. Lady Windermere's birthday will be celebrated tonight with a brilliant reception... Among the guests will be many notable personages of society. "When a married man dismisses his own car... ...and hires a taxi--!" "You may find - in your husband's cheque book... ...the name of Mrs. Erlynne." "It's not fair of me and I know it, but... I love you." "I am desperate - if you refuse to invite me tonight... ...I will go to my daughter and tell her who I am!" "To be seen at your house tonight means my social recognition... ...possibly my marriage to Lord Augustus." "Since that day at the races I have never said One Word about Mrs. Erlynne." There is nothing wrong- believe me, dear. I simply helped a woman who deserved it." "You will change your mind when you meet her... ...I have asked her here tonight." "If she dares to come here- I will strike her across the face with this fan!" Happy Birthday Through the hour for the reception had arrived... ...Mrs. Erlynne still waited for her invitation card. "Lord Darlington." "You were quite wrong. My husband has never met Mrs. Erlynne." List of guests. My dear Mrs. Erlynne-- please do not come tonight... ...My wife is so upset about your invitation that I am forced to cancel it... Regretfully Windermere "Mrs. Erlynne!" "Please introduce me to Lady Windermere." "How kind of you to honor us!... ...I have heard so much about you - from every side." "I have yearned - positively yearned - to meet the best dressed woman in London!" "I am leaving England tomorrow-- You will never see me again. Good bye, Margaret." "Is it too late to ask you to marry me?" "Lord Windermere is looking for you--" "I am sure he has not missed me- you have entertained him so well." You may have your Mrs. Erlynne- I am going to Darlington who loves me... Margaret. "Your wife has a little headache - she is lying down." "--and we became quite friendly- really! I told her of my engagement... ...to Lord Augustus and she was delighted." "She wants to rest, do you see? Don't disturb her." "Do not wake her. If necessary, make some little apology for her." "Did you find Lady Windermere?" You may have your Mrs. Erlynne- I am going to Darlington who loves me... Margaret. "I swear to you there is nothing between Lord Windermere and myself!... Go home! Please go home!" "Trust me, child - trust me as you would your own mother." "How dare a woman like you speak of my mother - my mother!" "I did just what you are doing tonight - and ruined my life." "If they find you here you will be dishonored - an outcast!" "I am afraid I took your wife's fan by mistake - so sorry!" "Forgive me for intruding - I am sure it will never be necessary again." The following morning. "You were right about Mrs. Erlynne. She is thoroughly bad. Last night--" I am just leaving for France. I only came to say goodbye... ...Mrs Erlynne "Don't tell him! You would kill his love- ...and spoil the only decent thing I ever did." "Your conduct last night was outrageous! I have decided not to marry you." THE END
