How long did Carrell say? - 15 minutes. Then we run through the second act. - Just time for a drink. How about it? No thanks, Frank. I think I'll stay here for a smoke. Okay. Good morning, Jim. - Hello Frank. Double Scotch and plain water. No ice. Sorry Frank. No more credit. Oh Jim. Is that a nice way for one trouper to treat another? I can't help it. This is you seventh day of rehearsal. And according to Equity, they can let you out without paying you a cent. And you are in to me for a week's tabs. They won't let me out, Jim. I'm just made for this part. A visiting Duke from Arabia. Cigarette? - Thanks. Now if you're so confident, how come you need a drink so early in the morning? You know the talk on the street is that the play don't look so good. And that Benson is going to call the whole thing off today. So he doesn't have to pay anybody. - Oh. They are just a little uncertain .. Because the play needs some rewriting and the author hasn't shown up yet. Good morning, Mr Benson. How are you Carrell? Hello Frank. - How do you do, Miss Paige. Say, she called you Frank. Maybe they won't let you out. Maybe the show is going on. Here. Help yourself. What will it be, folks? Aspirin. - Bicarbonate. Bromo. Excuse me. Now look, boys. The author will show up. He'll do the rewriting. It's all going to be alright. It's still a witty play. I don't know. Maybe there is no such person as Gaylord Esterbrook. It sounds like a phony name to me anyway. It is not. I phoned Redfield Minnesota. His landlady said he left two weeks ago. Anyhow I'm glad to know there is such a place as Redfield. I was doubtful about that too. I am still not convinced about Minnesota. Well, I brought you three Scotches. Where is the aspirin? - In the Scotch. You know, I didn't take you folks seriously. You didn't read that third act. [ Door knocks ] [ Door knocks ] You has positively left town. And have you the menu well in mind for tonight, Rosalie? I certainly have. Plumber's eggs and .. That is "plover's" eggs. Not "plumber's" eggs. Plover's eggs and partridge. Why can't you remember a simple line? I can't keep that fancy food in my head. You change it to pork chops and beans. I'll remember that. And suppose we change the locale of this play from Park Avenue to Harlem? How would that suit you? That would suit me fine. And have you the menu well in mind for tonight, Rosalie? I certainly have. Rover's eggs and cockroaches. Pipe down. There's a rehearsal going on. - Yeah. My play. Listen, I've been in show business 48 years. You are either here to serve a summons or you are an actor looking for a job. One thing I am sure of. You're not the author of that play. Well, all I can do is tell you again that my name is Gaylord Esterbrook. I admit I don't know anybody that looks like the name Gaylord Esterbrook. Including myself, but believe me. It may be your name alright, but you can't say you wrote that play in there. Why, it is about Park Avenue. There's even a Duke and a Duchess in it. - I know. I put them in. That. That is a scene in Miss Gardner's apartment with the Duke. She is just offering him a cigarette. I must say Ronald that you are beautifully charming. And you Miss Gardner are charmingly beautiful. I am very much afraid you have a flair for flattery. Rather an understatement. Do sit down. Now. Now do you believe it? I'll never believe it. But I'll tell them you are here. I beg your pardon, Mr Benson. There's a young fellow at the stage door that claims he is Gaylord Esterbrook. Esterbrook? Where is he? About time. Benny. That third act. I didn't know whether to believe him or throw him out. Throw him out. Well. I must ask you again. Ronald, are you going to leave or must I telephone the police? I am not going to leave but if you think it would be amusing .. Telephone the police by all means. No, I have a better idea. Here. Here is my railroad ticket. My name is right on there. And here is my name on the lining of the suit there. The lining of the hat has G.E. Gaylord Esterbrook. Here is a card I have. My name is on that. "Redfield Volunteer Fire Department." I'll get in touch with Ripley right away. I am convinced. I am glad to see you with us, Mr Esterbrook. I am Richard Benson, your producer. - Well, I am glad to know you, sir. You are just as I pictured you. - Thank you. Now this is Morgan Carrell. He is directing the play. Glad to know you, sir. How do you do. I hope I live up to your dream of me. Uhuh? I never gave him much thought. I hope you've given a little thought to that third act of yours. There's time enough for that later. Mr Esterbrook must be very anxious to see how his play looks from the stage. Yes, I certainly am. Joe, show Mr Esterbrook out to the front of the house. Yes, sir. Right this way, Mr Esterbrook. Carrell and I will arrange things on the stage. Alright. Where shall I sit out there? Right in the center. I want the actors to have a look at you too. What writers can move from Redfield to write high comedy? What does he know about Park Avenue? Doesn't mean a thing. I don't know anything about Park Avenue either and I live on the darned street. Right everyone, from the beginning. Set them up for Act 1 will you, Max. Yes, Mr Carrell. - Go out in the auditorium. I have got a surprise for you. Now don't ask any questions. We got all new seats here, huh. Would you mind running out and getting me a pack of cigarettes please? Sure. Wait a minute. I'll give you the 15 cents. No, that's alright. - Here is a quarter. No, I have .. - It's alright. You can keep the change. I kinda feel I should be here when the play starts. I'll tell you all about it. Linda. I want you to meet our author: Gaylord Esterbrook. Surprise. Give me my quarter back. - Sure. How do you do. - How do you do. Well, you have a part in my play Miss ..? She is only the star, that's all. Linda Paige. Oh, Linda Paige. Oh. Then I insist on getting the cigarettes. No. I think you had better sit down. We are going to start right away. Excuse me. You'd better sit next to Carrell. You might want to compare notes. Hurry up, up there. Have you got a cigarette? I don't smoke. Here you are, Linda. Is that really Linda Paige? Cross my heart. For my money she is a little skinny to be a star. Well, it's Benson's money so you can stop worrying. By the way, why did it take you two weeks to get here? Well I just didn't come right straight here. You see .. The railroad had an excursion to Grand Canyon. I couldn't pass the opportunity. You only live once. How did you like the canyon? - Oh, that place .. That's what everybody says. You know how wide it is at one point? - Twenty-seven miles. Then from the canyon we went south to Santa Fe and El Paso. Then went over to New Orleans, had dinner there and headed up for New York. That was your mistake. And on the way back we're going to take in the Indian festival up at Gallup. That's always interesting. And then we are going north to Cheyenne for the rodeo. Let's watch the rehearsal from the back. I am getting train sick. Ever been to the Grand Canyon? - No, I haven't. Have you, Dick? - No, I haven't. Have you, Carrell? - No. Then how do you know it's 27 miles wide? What a relief that nobody got their notice, huh? Don't celebrate yet. They have until midnight to notify us. I guess we'd better keep our phones off the hook. I heard them talking. They're meeting at Benson's apartment for dinner tonight. They will decide things there. - I hope it is a good dinner. Say, I'm having a little trouble figuring out this map. What subway do I take to get up to 72nd Street and Lexington Avenue? I ain't giving no information on subways. We are competitors. - Oh. I'm sort-of new here, you see. I just got in from Minnesota this morning. A refugee, huh? Look Buddy, why not forget about the subways. First of all, you have to take the shuttle. Then you have to take the express and then you take a local. The chances are still 3-1 you will wind up in Brooklyn. Now, you are too nice a guy to end up like that. Why don't you just jump in the cab here and leave the details to me? I would sorta like to take the subway. Goodnight. - Goodnight, Miss Paige. Good evening, Miss Paige. - Hello, George. Mr Esterbrook, can I drop you off someplace? Well, no. I was just getting a little information. 1150, Park Avenue. - Yes, sir. Remember, 7:30 sharp. - Goodnight. I'll tell La Guardia you are in town. Which way you going? I'm going up to 72nd and Lexington Avenue. I don't know. This map seems to go to the 65th and stops. Well, I can take you. I am going up town. Oh. Well .. Thanks very much. But you know, I have read so much about it I'd sorta like to take the subway. At this time of day? The subway during rush hour is just undeclared war. Well, that's more or less part of New York don't you think? Millions of people going home and pushing and shoving. But you have to have years of experience to know how to push and shove back. They'll know you are a stranger and gang up on you. Well. I would still sorta like to try it. Then I will go with you. Somebody has to be there to identify the body. George, you take the car home. I'd like it really. So if you will .. 72nd and Lexington, eh? That's right around the corner from Benson. He is at 73rd and Park. Are you staying in a hotel or with friends? No. The Lexington YMCA. Oh, I see. With friends. It's a great place they have up there. I don't know. They've never asked me over. That's my idea of big-city stuff, that place. Do you find it cosmopolitan? - They've got everything up there. They got eleven billiard tables. They got a swimming pool 80 feet long and tiled right up to the ceiling. And they got ping-pong. At night you have lectures, educational movies. They get a new movie every night. They've even got a class on playwriting once every two weeks. I wouldn't mention that to Carrell if I were you. He might insist you take it. Foreigners, eh? Beg your pardon. - Pardon me. Oh, could you tell me how to get to 125th Street? No, not right offhand. I have a map here but it just goes as far as 65th Street. 65th? 65th. That is far enough. Where is the subway? Right there. - Thank you. I got it. Boy, that is great. Yes. Oh, there you are. I am sorry to be so late. I left some notes at the "Y". I'll be right back. I say it is wordy, unwieldy. Morgan, I think it has a charm all its own. I must say I agree with Morgan wholeheartedly. But I do see Linda's point of view clearly. Perhaps it will help if I read the notes I took at this afternoon's rehearsal. Yes, by all means. Let's get everybody's point of view. I think you will find these notes pretty unbiased. First scene. First act. Interesting introduction of characters. Abundance of laughs. Second scene. The story starts unfolding in .. A masterful manner. Second act. This act has too many laughs. That is possible. Third act. This act holds up nicely. The dialog here. Is. Most brilliant. Well. I feel very optimistic about the whole thing. If you have finished with that document. I'd like to frame it. Alright. On the way home this afternoon. I took the trouble to stop in at the public library and look up Redfield. It has a population of 786. Including livestock. It has one movie house. Which shows triple features. All of them westerns. The nearest any self-respecting railroad will come to Redfield is thirty miles. Its cultural center. Is the hot stove in the grocery store. The main industry is whittling. And you have the audacity to write about high society. No wonder the play is clunky, graceless, inept, clumsy artificial and hopeless. Now, this is my last word on this piece of pretentious tripe. Nothing personal in this you understand. Oh no. No. I'm sorry, folks. But when I get excited I just can't sit still. At home I usually go for a long walk in the woods. The best we can offer you in the way of woods. Is a sprig of fern. Look here. I've taken just about all I'm gonna take from you. You've said enough. Are you threatening me? - Yeah. That's right. In that case it is possible have said enough. Yeah. Now Morgan, you're judging this play not by what it is but by where it came from. What's wrong with coming from the provinces? Many New York sophisticates are from the sticks. Where are you from by the way? - We won't go into that. Now Benny, I've made money for you, haven't I? I know this play isn't perfect but I've got a hunch about it. It is one of those things that somehow gets over. At least it merits a chance. And what if you do lose a little money, Benny. It will remind you of '29. You'll feel young again. Please do it. Please, Benny. For me. I will do it and you know me once my mind is made up. Thank you, Benny. You can come out of the woods now. No. I am too excited. I think I need some air. There's a terrace out there I never use. Thanks very much. Excuse me please. Have you finished it, Robert? Not quite yet, sir. But so far it is rather good. As upset as you are, I thought you might like to eat your dessert. Eat it? I don't even know what it is. Well, you mention this three times in your play. It is chocolate mousse. Is that what it is? - Hmm. I guess I must have read about it someplace. I thought it was smart .. and never came face to face with one. Let me introduce you to it. I don't know. I pictured it as a sort of a .. Cake-like thing. Oh, doggone it. Don't worry about it. Manna is the only thing people are taught to fall from heaven. But on Park Avenue they will take chocolate mousse to try. Thanks, anyway. - That's alright. Look. Thanks for .. Getting Benson to put on my play. Don't be silly. You wrote me a good part. I was protecting it. Tell me something. How did you happen to write a play like this? Well, the .. The dramatic society back home wanted to put on a play so I wrote one for them. It was all about Redfield and people I know back there. Yes, I see. But I mean about this play. "Dilemma at dinner". - It is the same one. I changed it around a little bit. Made the local folks Dukes and Duchesses. Wasn't that a little difficult? I mean writing about people you don't know? No. I always figured people are pretty much the same everywhere. After all, how many Dukes and Duchesses are there to know? Do you know any? Uhuh. One. The doorman at The Versailles. Where is that? - It's a restaurant. Tell me, do you do anything else besides write plays? Well, I am editor of the Redfield Daily Reporter. Oh. A town of seven hundred .. - Look out. That's alright. A town of seven hundred people has a Daily Reporter? Seven hundred and eighty-six. 786. Well, we call it the Daily Reporter. It comes out twice a month. Isn't that confusing for your readers? I never thought of that, but I guess it is. Don't mind my asking so many questions. It is an Irish characteristic. Irish? You are Irish? - Uhuh. But Paige? We call it Paige. It is really Haggerty. Oh. I'm a melting pot. I am hundred percent American on my father's side. On my mother's side there's a dozen nationalities fighting it out. Mostly minority races. I like that. You know, people with many races in their family make-up are always .. Interesting. Oh. The most fascinating person I've ever met is just .. Plain Irish. [ Fire engine siren! ] Hey, that sounds like a fire. Doesn't it? Yeah, look. Look, there are the engines. Boy, look at the length of that hook and ladder. Do you like to go to fires? I can take 'em or leave 'em. I've never missed one in my life. They .. I will see you tomorrow. Goodbye. Hey! Thanks for your hospitality. A wonderful dinner. Goodbye. What is the matter with him? - He has gone to a fire. He never misses one. You know he is an eccentric young man even for a playwright. I cannot argue with you there. No, sir. You read it carefully? - Yes, sir. No, sir. Robert has an infallible instinct. But you just said you'd made up your mind. I have. We are not going to do this play. I am sorry I am late but the subway was crowded and I missed my train. Is everybody here now? May I have your attention for a few minutes please? I will be as brief as possible. I want to finish before Mr Esterbrook arrives. I know you were notified by Mr Benson last night that he will cancel the play. But I got you here today because I have great faith in Dilemma At Dinner. It just doesn't seem right to me that it shouldn't have its chance. Now, Mr Benson. Has contracted this theater for at least two weeks. It's all paid for. There's no reason why we shouldn't use it. Also, the scenery is ordered and being built. We might just as well use that. Now of course, there is the question of salaries. If we waived our salaries .. And went on a purely cooperative basis .. And shared the profits, providing of course there are any profits. We all might make a lot of money. Now I'm willing to do it. How about you? It will mean risking a lot of our time. I have had an offer from Hollywood. So have I. - Frankly, I .. I don't think I can wait until the play has started and some money came in. Well, I could advance you some and take it out of your percentage later. What about our director? What about Carrell? Well, Morgan may be a little tough. But I think I can get around him. How about it? If you are willing to take a chance .. - Every play is a gamble. You can count me in, Miss Paige. - Thank you. It is marvellous. This is the mind of spirit I like. You can count me in. Not only that, but to cut down on expenses .. I'll not only play my part but I'll understudy for you too. Now hold your breath, Miss Paige. Thank you, Clementine. It's so sweet of you to help me out like this. It seems as though my maid is always getting sick on opening nights. I don't mind. I was a personal maid before I became an actress. And I suppose I'll go back to it when the public gets tired of me. Are you nervous, Clementine? Now that you mention it, I am. I'm never nervous before that curtain goes up. But once it does somebody has to stand there and push me on. Well, I tell you, as long as we is cooperating. You push me on and I'll push you on. [ Door knocks ] Come in. I just thought I would drop by and wish you good luck. You said everything in your telegram. It was a very nice one. Thank you. Well, it was just ten words. Mr Esterbrook. - What? I know it is kind of late to bring it up. But what is underneath my part? Why do I do the things I do? What is the motivation? Who am I? Etcetera. Look, just keep answering phones and opening doors the way you've been doing. That will be alright. Where will you be? In the wings or out front? As dramatic critic for the Redfield Daily Reporter .. I should be out front but I'm so nervous I'll just pick out a corner someplace. Five minutes to curtain. - Let's start pushing. You have a return ticket to Redfield, I suppose? Hang on to it. I'll be here for the first two acts. Nobody knows where I will be for the third, anyway. Good luck, Linda. Thank you, Morgan. Well. Good luck. Thank you. That boy hasn't been round very much, has he. Good luck, Clementine. But he is learning. Better hurry up, folks, The curtain is going up. I hope you like the show. [ Laughter ] So far, it is not so bad. - Linda Paige is simply swell. Loaded with laughs, isn't it. - I've never heard such witty dialogue. I told Mabel if she wanted to wreck her life with two such lovely children .. Then go right ahead I said and .. Oh. You know just as well as I do that the man is absolutely no beauty. I don't know what it is all about. - All I know is it didn't make me laugh. Well it's written by an amateur. Even I could tell that. It is very confused and complicated. What's so complicated about it? It is very simple. A man loves a woman .. - Simple? If you can tell me who's .. I beg your pardon. - Okay. I am sure the second act will clear things up for you. I got them all lined up and waiting, Mr Carrell. I want a drink. - Yes. Third acts give me a lot of trouble too. Stay away from me. I am praying. Well? What will you have to drink, Mr Esterbrook? Well .. What is Mr Carrell having? - Six Scotches. Well, I'll have six champagnes. Six champagnes? What kind of champagne would you like, Mr Esterbrook? What was that? - What kind of champagne do you like? The type with bubbles. Bubbles? - Bubbles. I guess all us playwrights are crazy. Hey, there's no laughs. There should be more laughs in this act than any other. [ Gunshot! ] [ Gunshot! ] [ Female scream! ] [ Gunshot! ] I killed him. Sure I killed him. The rat. He had it coming to him. I'll go to the penitentiary for this. I don't care. I am glad he is dead. Do you hear? Glad! What have they done to my third act? You changed my whole third act. No, I didn't. I couldn't. It was too awful. I was standing there smoking a cigarette. All of a sudden, a form hurtles towards me. What happened to you two? - How did it go over? Very nicely, Seven curtain calls. - Seven? This is a police station. Reporters came in without knocking. Did anybody yell: "author, author"? That scene on the staircase. Did it get laughs? Half laughs, half corpses. Where did you get that there eye? This is a police station. We can talk a little shop too. Do we have to stay here? Let's go someplace else. Good idea. Come on. Hey! Where do you think you are going? I beg your pardon. Now how about it? Would you like to prefer charges? - Forget the whole thing. And how about you. Any charges against him? Then get the heck out of here the three of you. We would be glad to buy tickets for the policeman's ball. Get out of here! We don't want you at our affairs. I'm sorry we caused you all this trouble, Sheriff. You see, I had champagne for the first six times in my life and .. And the street was all lined with theaters .. And I walked in the wrong lobby and listened to the wrong third act. I am sorry, Carrell. - It's alright. I need the exercise. The reviews will be out in a few hours. We can wait up for them. Let's all go to a bar and sit around. No, no. In my state I couldn't sit down in any place. Don't you remember, Linda? He usually takes a long walk in the woods. Well, there is Central Park practically around the corner. It is? That's not the real thing but I will make it do. You know, we really should have opened this play in the Catskills. Well, goodnight and good luck. Gaylord, you will find Linda and me at the 87 Club. Alright. Central Park is a good idea. I could use a little air I think. I think you could use a chaperone. Won't you come along, Morgan? You can read less enthusiasm into an invitation than any actress I know. No thanks. I'll go home to bed. If the reviews are good, don't ever wake me up. What time did I ask for the car? Five o'clock. What time is it now? You still have a few minutes. You had better go to sleep on my shoulder now. While I keep watch. - Oh no. You don't look bad at all for a girl who is just getting up in the morning. For a man who has been up all night you look great. Don't get the idea that I'm an authority on girls getting up in the morning. Well, I am not the last word on men staying up all night either. A bit cold? Not really. It's just my teeth chattering gives you that impression. Oh well, I'll put my coat around you. Alright, as long as your arm is in it. What? Don't attach any special significance to that. It is just that I can keep warm without you catching cold. Oh, you forget I come for that cold country up around Minn .. God bless you. Thanks. Maybe that is a pretty good idea of yours. Here. There we are. - Yes. Say. Were you ever married? Me? No. That is pretty hard to believe. A beautiful girl like you. You ever been in love? At regular intervals. Well then, why do you .. The first two times we were both too young. Then in some cases his people objected. And in other cases my folks objected. A few years ago there was an actor. Then he went with a road company and that was the last of him. And you know how it's been the last few years. Slow and everything. How about you? You ever married? - No. Never. Well, you needn't be so vehement about it. Didn't you ever propose to a girl? No. Not right out. Oh. I see. Someday, no doubt you'll meet a sweet lovely mind-reader and she'll walk .. A paper, sir? Paper, sir? Morning paper, sir? Want a paper, sir? Take those. I'll take the tabloids. Here. Keep the change. They don't use this big type on the Redfield Daily Reporter. "Dilemma at Dinner. A refreshing comedy." Give it to me. Right there. "Last night at the Garrick Theater a new play by a new author came to New York." "'Dilemma at Dinner' by Gaylord Esterbrook." "It stumbles through an uncertain first act, gains momentum in the second .." "But is saved completely by a brilliantly sustained third act." There it is: right in black and white. You'd better not smile too much. It's only one paper. Let's see what the others have to say. There it is. You're ripping the middle of the review. Hold up your side there. "A pleasant comedy made pleasanter by a cracking good third act." "Matchless performance by a matchless Linda Paige." "Comedy writing at its best." "Never once does she let go of her hold on the audience." Let's see what the others have to say. That's good, huh. Yes, so far. Well. You are a hit. You are a success. Do you know what that means? I'll be able to have a whole suite of rooms at the "Y" now, huh? Perhaps you'll be able to realise things more clearly from a sitting position. Alright. I am sitting down but I still can't believe it. Let me see that other paper. - Give me this one. Here it is. "More impressive due to the circumstance under which the play was produced." "Early during the rehearsal period." "The play found itself without a producer." "Richard Benson had lost faith in the play but not Linda Paige." "Who persuaded the cast to continue on a cooperative footing." "It was on this basis that this new hit was presented to the public last night." "Perhaps such tribulations would benefit many other Broadway .." "Productions." Of course, that's not much thanks for what you have done. Oh. Don't bother to apologise. I know when I have been attacked. You what? It came none too soon. I was just on the point of attacking you. I don't quite understand. Now look. Are you sure you never proposed to anyone? And are you sure no-one ever proposed to you? Well, I .. let me think. Evidently, no-one did. That is going to make it a little tougher. You know, I have been meaning to speak to you about this for weeks but .. I thought I'd wait to see if you were a success first. You know, a woman has to think of those things. Well, this is the situation. In a few months' time I suppose I could manoeuvre you to the point .. Where you would think you were proposing to me. But .. I am 27, and time is of the essence. Wait a minute. You're a man. - Wait a minute. And I am a woman .. - Wait a minute now! You're proposing to me? - Certainly. I had better stand up. This isn't the sort of thing you can take sitting down. Oh dear. I hope this doesn't mean another walk in the woods. This is a very interesting situation. But if you marry me you'd have to give up your room at the "Y". Maybe you don't love me enough to make that sacrifice. Maybe you don't love me at all. - Love you? Linda, from the first moment I saw you. But I never hoped. I never dared dream. After all, I'm from Redfield Minnesota and you're from Park Avenue New York. They are so far apart. - Well, it is not a matter of mileage. Holly mackerel. My play opens. I have my fingerprints taken. My hand is asked in marriage. The things that have happened to me tonight. Before you change your mind. Sure, I'll marry you. For heaven's sakes will you do something concrete about it. I don't know whatever gave me the idea you were skinny. Oh. Hello, Mr Carrell. - Hello Clementine. I thought you was in Hollywood. I am out on parole. Oh. I saw your last picture, Mr Carrell. Yes? - Yes. What did you think? - Yeah. Going to the Wylers' dinner party with the folks? - Uhuh. Miss Linda will be right out. Pour yourself a drink. - How about you, Clementine? Not me. I am a solitary drinker. Morgan, darling. Linda. You look colossal. - What a tan. We'll soon bring the pallor back to you cheeks. Why did you leave Hollywood? I came back to ask you to marry me. All of this is going to make mighty good testifying later on. You didn't need to take a long trip to propose. You could've written a letter. I am too smart to put those things in writing. Besides, I figured your husband might come up with a new play. He hasn't a thing on paper. He is between ideas. Does that mean he is on his usual between-ideas binge? We've had quite a time with him. Did you call the bars at the Radford, the Regent and the Rex? Yes, ma'am. He's been at all three of them and headed for the exits. Four years ago Gay didn't know the names of two drinks. Now he's an authority of Slivovitz. He has used the same story in the last four plays. Why doesn't he use it again? I suppose he'll get around to it in a week or so. I tell you it's a funny feeling pacing the corridor .. Waiting for your husband to give birth to a play. There is Gay now. Excuse me please. Hello darling. Hello dear. Morgan is here. Well he can go right back to the coast. I am not going to write another play. Hello Carrell. How are you? - How are you, Gay? I .. saw your last picture. I told him what I thought too. Well Linda, I have made up my mind. No more of this hanging around here waiting to get an idea. We'll take an excursion to Yellowstone. Are you still taking excursions? Alright, dear. But first of all we are going to the Wylers' dinner party. Dearest .. is that thing tonight? Hmm. You'd better hurry and jump into a dinner jacket. No. I've shaved. That is enough concession. Alright. Just as long as I get you to the Wylers. You are going against my advice. They are awful dull people. Now Clementine, they are very nice people. Besides the food is excellent. You can go there if you want to but don't invite them here. They bores me stiff. Don't you worry, Clementine. Just sit down and relax. We'll take care of everything. - Thank you. They'll expect you to make wisecracks all evening. And you won't be able to think of a thing. You had better take this with you. No. If I get stuck for an answer I'll call you up. Clementine, are you sitting on my hat? So I am. I completely crumpled it. Well, it is a small hat. A sombrero would have met with the same fate. Slivovitz. Gay, this is Philo Swift. Gaylord Esterbrook. How are you. - How do you do. Gaylord Esterbrook. It seems to me I've heard or read that name someplace. What do you do? I write plays. Yes. I have a hobby too. What I meant was, what do you do for a living? I write plays. Anything wrong? No, no. Nothing, nothing. If you'll pardon me, it does seem a little trivial for a grown man. Well, perhaps I will grow out of it. What do you do? - I am in Wall Street. Where is that? I don't know but my chauffeur finds it every morning. After you get there, what do you do? Buy and sell stocks and bonds. Surely not for a living? And not a bad one. When stocks go up I make a little money. When they go down, I make even more. Is that all you do? Yes. Who knows, perhaps you will grow out of it too. Here is hoping. What's the matter? That woman over there who just came in the door. Did you see her? I don't know who she is but she has been giving me the eye all evening. Have you ever been given the eye? That particular eye, yes. You two men didn't look as if you were enjoying each other's company so much. So I have come over. May I have the rest of your drink? My name is Amanda Swift. - I am Gaylord Esterbrook. Of course. I know that. This is Mr Philo Swift. Swift. Swift - Swift. You two aren't related by any chance? Philo and I have been married for .. How long is it now, dear? They know at City Hall. Well. Well. Married. So am I. Pardon me, Mr Swift but you are wanted on the telephone, sir. Is this a legitimate call or did you arrange it to get me out of the way? I arranged it to get you out of the way. Alright. I prefer talking to a dead wire. I didn't like the tone of that pat. Oh, believe me. It is because he couldn't think of a thing to say. Well, I will .. Look around and see if I can find you a place where I can ask you to sit down. I have .. I have arranged that too. Do you know why I brought you out here? Well .. no. To tell you how sorry I am for you. Oh. Is there something about myself I should know? The curtain hadn't been up ten minutes on your first play. Before I realized that you had latent possibilities. But they have never been realized. Why have you never won a Pulitzer prize? I often wondered about that myself. Were you ever once called upon to make a curtain speech? No. No, I have never been called upon. I always had one ready though. Yes, for years I've had a curtain speech prepared for just such an occasion. Never had a chance to use it. That is why when I sit at your plays and you make the people laugh .. I feel like weeping. As a matter of fact you may be right. Maybe the reason why I'm having such a hard time getting an idea .. Is maybe because I haven't anything to say. You know, Miss Swift. What is your first name again? Amanda. And I am never called Mandy. You know Mandy, you're the first woman .. I've been looking all over for you. We had a phone call. We have to go home. Clementine is lonely. I don't want to go home. I'm having a wonderful time. So am I, but you know Clementine. Oh my .. - What is the matter? I thought perhaps that man was coming out. He's been very polite about it but he's been on my tree all evening. What man? - Right there. That is my husband. Darling, do you know Amanda Swift? This is my wife, Linda. How do you do. I've seen you on the stage for years and years. Swift? Oh dear. - What's the matter? I understood him to say his name was "Smith". Naturally, I didn't believe him so I said my name was Brown. I've got to go right back up. Hello. Luxury Turkish baths? Connect me with the department for taking care of gentlemen on the loose. Line busy? I'll wait. [ Buzzer ] Mr Swift? - That's right. Miss Paige will be right in. - Thank you. Excuse me while I finish a phone call. Just make yourself at home. Hello? Has Mr Esterbrook been there today? No? Well, if he should be carried in ask him to call his apartment. If he can talk. How do you do. I am very glad to see you. Thank you. Alright, Clementine. - He ain't at the Turkish bath. Alright, Clementine. There is a matinee at Biskeys. Shall we try him there? No thank you, Clementine. - Why not? It ain't unlikely. No thank you, Clementine. You men. Highball? - Yes, yes. Scotch or Rye? - Scotch. Soda please. You must be surprised at my visit. A little. After all, it's 4 months since the Wylers. I haven't seen you. You haven't called. I haven't even read about you in the papers. Unlike you theatre people I pay a man a big salary to keep me out of the papers. Well, I am very glad you dropped by. I am in a wretched mood. I always am when I am between plays. What does an actress do between plays? Worries about her next. Gets depressed. Thinks she is through. Looks in the mirror. Thinks she'd better get on with it and have a good time. Has a good time. The mirror should reassure you. Well that is very nice of you. But you don't see what the mirror sees. Art has intervened. You told me at the Wylers you relied very little on cosmetics. What a memory you have. - I have an infallible memory. Some time ago in Washington my firm had to submit to an investigation. I was on the stand being questioned by an eager but badly informed new-dealer. It caused a sensation because I happened to know the cost of steel rails in 1877. Would you like to telephone? I have an errant husband. He is between ideas. And between ideas he makes an alcoholic tour of the town. Just to forget he is between ideas. This is a list of his haunts. It is rather a game to track him down. I was just thinking. How would it be to call some of the better class police stations? No, Clementine. If he were in a police station we'd hear from them. I am going to give him a half hour more. And then I am going to start calling the hospitals. I wonder. Maybe I should call the 47th Street Station. I can save you the call. He is not at the 47th Street Station. Why do you say that? You might try Regent 3-9-7-7-7. What place is that? It is my house. Really? Yes. Hmm. I don't see what that has to do with .. - You guess my visit was not impromptu? I didn't know that Gay and your wife .. I am not suggesting that they are. Thank you very much. You have relieved me greatly. I am delighted to know that he is not on a binge. You are very much in love with him. How did you know? That evening at the Wylers you let it drop. I talk too much. - Not for me you don't. Well, Gay hasn't seen your wife since that dinner party at the Wylers, has he? He has been seeing her ever since. Yes. It is stupid of him not to tell me. Why ever didn't he tell me? Your wife is very attractive. And are you very much in love? I have been married before. I shouldn't like to be divorced a second time. It gets to be undignified. This is a curious interview. - Why? Well, if you don't mind my saying so, Mr Swift .. It would have been more seemly if it had taken place with your wife than with me. I don't discuss things with my wife. We are beyond that stage. Did you come here to tell me that my husband and your wife are .. Not at all. In the first place, that is unimportant. In the second place, though perhaps my wife .. Still does not suspect it and I am sure your husband doesn't. The situation is far more dangerous than that. Really, I have come here not to warn you. But through you, your husband. Of what? - Of being discovered. I beg your pardon? When she said of your husband .. That he possessed latent possibilities as yet unrealised. I knew then his position was perilous. You see, my wife has a passion for developing latent powers. When they are not there she invents them. I can't somehow, if you will forgive me .. What? Take your wife seriously as a rival. She is very pretty. Very attractive and I am sure very gay. She is not gay. She is serious. She looks so .. forgive me .. A bit fluffy. She is a Lorelei with an intellectual patter. I'm afraid I have taken up a great deal of your time, Miss Paige. Not at all, Mr Swift. It has been extremely provocative. You will come again I hope. - Thank you. I hope you will soon be doing a play. I shall come to see it. I hope so too. A play is what I need most in life. I hope your wife will inspire my husband to write one. It is quite possible. She adores to inspire. If my husband is still at your house when you get home. Please don't give him my regards. I don't care to intrude upon his personal life .. Unless he wishes to share it with me voluntarily. On the other hand, perhaps you had better not go home. I don't like the idea of Gay suddenly having to duck out the back door. Spiritually, he won't be alone. He will be surrounded by the ghosts of dozens of others .. In whom my wife has seen latent possibilities. Good evening. - Good evening. Has that bad boy called up yet? Not yet. He will sure be fried. I wonder where that travelling man can be. He must have found a new place. I believe he has. I had better get dressed for dinner. I am going out with Mr Carrell. Well, we're living in a democracy and everyone is entitled to their own taste. Why, boss. How come you opened the door by yourself? I have been practising, tulip. Hello darling. - Hello, dear. And you is cold sober too. He is cold sober, Miss Linda. If you will overlook it this time, pet. I won't let it happen again. Don't worry about it, Clementine. He's deceptive. He may collapse any minute. Yeah. That is a good idea. I will collapse right now. A spiritual collapse, hyacinth. It ain't spiritual. I don't smell it on your breath. I have been calling you everywhere. You worked today? - No. You tried? I am tired. Never mind. You will tomorrow. No. Not tomorrow. What is the use. I am fooling myself. I've got nothing to say. You say it so charmingly. Oh charm. Look at this world. Full of wars and destructions and upheavals. And you expect me to go on babbling in some never-never land. No, sir. If I can't write anything important I am not going to write anything at all. Darling, the world is depressed. Now is the moment to be gay if possible. It is like calling for a minuet in a plague town. Oh, darling. I must be such a bore. Why do you put up with me? No choice. - There are any number of .. For instance? - Well, anybody. I don't like them. - You are a fool. I guess I am. If I were you I'd quit. Well I will think it over carefully. Here you are my tired philosopher. I'm not worth bothering about or putting up with. Well, I'm sure there is someone in the world who'll disagree with you on that. I don't know anything about anything. I don't know anything about anything either, but I get by. Well, you're an actress. You don't have to. Besides, you are prettier than I am. I don't know. You are not bad. There are times when I thought you were beautiful. Darling. Darling. Oh .. I'm blue .. I'm low. I am sunk. I am bored with myself. Maybe that just means you are bored with me. You are so wonderful. Nevertheless. I get lonely for you when I'm walking along the street. Do you get over it when you come home? Come on, let's go out to dinner. I .. I have a dinner date with Morgan Carrell. Oh. You come along with us. No. I'll stick around here with my thoughts. Both of them. I will come home early. - No. No reason for that. But darling .. are we washed up? What? - Are we washed up? Now Linda, please. Let's not go in to fundamentals tonight. I'm in no mood for it. Okay. No fundamentals. After all, every marriage has to go through the doldrums sooner or later. We are in for ours. We just have to sit tight until we are through it. You ought to know by this time. Alright, dear. I love you. Thank you, dear. You know when I am not working I .. I know. It is quite alright. I will get out of your way. Well, please don't be self-effacing. Now that is not becoming to you. What would you like me to be? Oh, for Pete's sake. - Well what? Well .. a little less .. All-seeing. A little less all-wise. A little less .. Clairvoyant. I am right then in assuming we are washed up? You know, lots of times by prophesying the undesirable comes true you know. Not quite. I might need a little help from the outside. I imagine I am getting it. Now just what is behind that dark innuendo? Ain't nothing behind .. Now you keep out of this. I am not talking to you. With that attitude, I'll just deliver my message and have no more truck with you. Mr Carrell is waiting in the lobby for you. And he says he is hungry. I am sure sorry you are wearing this coat tonight, Miss Linda. Why? Well, I intended to wear it to the Savoy ball. But never mind. I'll make your silver-fox cape do. And boss. If you don't talk any louder I will just have to give up listening at keyholes. The domestic staff is beginning to bore me. You've done everything you can to spoil her, if you don't mind me saying so. Alright. Well anyway, where were we in our domestic relations now? I was just beginning to wonder if you coming home sober .. And your sudden concern over the world might not mean .. Might not mean what? Might not mean that you are not so much concerned for the world in general as .. With one woman of the world in particular. Well now, wait a minute. What are you ..? Of all the .. - Now just a minute. There is no reason to get yourself all twisted up. I am sorry you are out of sorts. I love very much. I can remember the boy from Redfield who came to New York with a map in his hand. And who waited up all night in Central Park for the reviews with me. Sometimes I wish those reviews hadn't been quite so good. Anyway, I still love you. Clementine! How did that number get on here? What number? You know very well which number: Regent 3-9-7-7-7. What are you getting so hot about? That ain't my writing. That is Miss Linda's writing. It's one of your new hideouts ain't it? Spying on me. Well, I'll show her. Morgan, how well do you know the Philo Swifts? Philo .. vaguely. Mandy? Yes. In a way. Hmm. What I'd like to know is why you are dragging me to their house like this. Gay is there with Amanda. It seems that is where he spends most of his spare time. Gay .. and ..? Well, in that case I know Amanda well enough to hope we are not too late. Driver, give it the gun. We are riding to the rescue. What do you want? - To get a book. You can't come in here. Gay is working. I just want to pop in and get my book and pop out. On no account must he be disturbed. - Oh, I won't disturb him. I will skirt around him. You don't seem to realize the importance of what is going on in here. Well, if it has become a shrine I will be glad to take my shoes off. The fact is Gay isn't too wonderful. Then why shouldn't he like me? I let him have my wife for inspirational purposes. I even let him use my library. Got it. Amanda, I've got it. Come over here, I want to tell it to you. Oh, hello Philo. Go ahead Amanda. Don't keep him waiting. We writers are very impatient people. We writers? Do you write? Not exactly, I compile. I am in the process of compiling a history of the trade routes before 1700. Sounds fascinating. - It is, believe me. Impossible man. Never mind. I have the whole solution. Gay, how wonderful. - Right. Now, this boy. Who has come back from the war who everybody else thinks is dead. His mother doesn't know him, his father and sister don't know him. And he realizes that it's best that they do think he is dead. I told you that before, didn't I? Alright, now here is the punch. Just as he is about to leave .. One person recognises him. His sweetheart. Alright. Now, she doesn't say anything to anybody. But that night. At the railroad station. She is waiting for him. And she calls him by his real name. And the curtain comes down. Oh Gay, you made me cry. I think it is good. I think it will hold. What do you think? - It is marvellous. Mandy, I love you. - Oh, Gay. I do love you. You're so good for me. You are so wonderful for me. I'd never had this idea if not for you. - Nonsense. Of course you would. But you got me started on this thing. I'd have never tried it if not for you. While you're so high on it why don't you put it down before you forget it? Alright, darling. Darling. I love you. No you don't. - I am so grateful to you. That's something quite different. Besides, there is no reason for it. My life is so empty. This is all I have. If I can help you to express yourself. I have always felt such profound things in you. Unrealised potentialities. You can be great, Gay. That is all the reward I want. That is the only relationship between us two that I want. Love can be a nuisance sometimes. Some people find it entertaining. - It's more trouble than it's worth. We are above all that, thank heaven. Our relationship has a sounder basis. Unless of course, suddenly we should find ourselves swept off our feet. That does happen sometimes, I fear. Yes? I beg your pardon, Madame. They phoned from the lobby. Mr Morgan Carrell and Mrs Esterbrook are on their way up. What? Thank you, Pearson. I will see them. - Very well, madam. She knew I was here. She's spying on me. You want to leave? - I should say not. How does she know you're here? - I don't know. She guesses. She guesses about everything. It's like living with a medium. It's bad that this happened just now when you're so excited about your idea. You could stay in the library and work. She need never know you're here at all. No thank you. I don't mind hiding in a bedroom but .. Hiding in a library is a little dry. I need a drink. I hate to think of you losing your enthusiasm. You ought to put down these ideas in a white heat. Yeah. I am as near white heat right now as I will ever get. I'll see Linda. Now you stay here and get to work. What did I do with my pencil? You're stirring your drink with it. - Oh. Mrs Swift will be out directly. - Thank you. How nice of you to come. And I do appreciate you not standing on ceremony and waiting to be asked. I am just Morgan's date tonight. I must go where he leads. You see, my next play deals with life in the slums. And I thought I would do a little research. But I really am glad to see you. You know Linda, you ought to do the inspiring and she should do the acting. The fact is Mandy, we are on a treasure hunt. Now, open the closet and let him out. Oh dear, I did think we were going to be much more polished than that. It takes too much time. Where is he? If it's Gay you're referring to, he is in the library. Working. Working? He hasn't worked in months. He and I were sitting in the library quietly after dinner. Having coffee. Listening to Brahms. When suddenly he got an idea. - At last. So, what he had to do was set it down at once. It sounds very rude. Now, I leave you two adorable creatures together so you can tear your eyes out. But you are not going are you? You have just come. I have just been struck by an idea. And I have got to go to a blonde's library to put it down. Besides. On the way over Linda made me promise to leave you two alone as soon as possible. Oh dear, I am being betrayed on all sides. Goodnight, Linda. - Goodnight. Goodnight, Mandy. I'd give a hundred bucks to overhear your conversation. I shall pray for you Linda to be victorious. What's he chattering about? - I haven't the faintest idea. In any event. I shall marry the survivor. If you both die in combat .. I shall retire to a nunnery. Won't you sit down? - Thank you. [ Footsteps ] That is Gay. He always paces when he is working. May I ask what he is working on? His new play. Really? I didn't know he had a new play. Really. I am so sorry. I am so terribly sorry. I assumed .. That's quite alright. I am delighted naturally. What is the play about? It is about immortality. What on earth does Gay know about immortality. Why didn't he tell me do you suppose? Because. I am so afraid you will misunderstand my motive. I assure you I won't. I'll understand it perfectly. Because .. There is no part in it for you. But that is so silly. May I have a cigarette? Of course. - I'll help myself. If he has written a play and a good one, why I will be delighted. I can always get another play. The important thing is for Gay to keep working. Surely he knows that and that I know it. Surely he understands .. - I'm sorry. I'm terribly sorry. I shouldn't have .. - But you're not sorry in the least. Now, shall we be honest with each other? It's enormously difficult I know but shall we try? What harm can it do you possibly? Now, you enjoy inspiring Gay. That's to say, you enjoy making love to Gay. I can understand that perfectly. But it is not true. I mean .. I mean we haven't .. it's not true. Well, if it's not true already it's imminent. Love Gay if you must, but for pity's sake don't ruin his style. The truth is that you see yourself as an influence with a capital "I". What vanity. We cannot really talk because we have nothing. Absolutely nothing in common. We are at opposite poles. Indeed we are. I wish I were at yours. You and Philo are so alike. Are we? Each of you isolated in your own careers, your own strengths. Your own egotism. Why don't you inspire Philo? Philo is beyond reach. Tell me, why do you always pick successes to inspire? Your husband was a rich successful man when you married him. My husband is an established playwright temporarily in the dumps. Why don't you stimulate someone obscure to greatness? Wouldn't that be more exciting? The artist who has arrived and who begins to doubt his talent. There is no more poignant tragedy than that. Well if this play you're drawing out of Gay like a bad tooth .. Turns out to be good I will never forgive you, Mandy. You are honest, at any rate. - Yes. I wish you could be. Come on now, try it. Just for the novelty. You can't understand faith or hope. You can't understand anything but foolish empty laughter. You are destructive. You are merciless. If I have furnished him with an oasis. Where he can escape to brood and dream, I am happy. Do you hear? Proud and happy. Good heavens. If she believes that I'm sunk. But you can't possibly. Now come clean, Mandy. It's all in fun. Teach me the technique. You know, how to get a man away from his wife by massaging his ego. Don't praise his profile. Admire his adjectives and his adverbs. Don't ask for kisses. Ask for a more profound third act. - How dare you. How dare you! It is inconceivable to you that anyone can be sincere. You can't believe the truth. You attribute the most sordid motives to .. To everything. And besides all that, you can cry. I am certainly and completely sunk. You are horrid. You are hateful and horrid and I .. I hate you. Hello. Hello, Mrs Esterbrook. Considering I've just put your wife into hysterics, I feel you can call me Linda. Yes, I heard the familiar notes. That is why I came. It sounds as if those sobs are being muffled on somebody's shoulder. I guess I must have done a complete job on Mandy. You needn't feel so proud. I make her cry all the time. It usually ends up with me giving her a check. I didn't give her a check. I think I just gave her my husband. In my office we would list that transaction as petty cash. What have you done to Mandy? Disfigured her beyond recognition. Scratched her eyes out. Did you notice? What did you say to her? - I don't recall. She is sobbing. - How nice for her, I wish I could. I think it's up to me Esterbrook, rather than you to speak in defence of my wife. But at the moment I can't think of any. - Alright. Now you keep out of this. Certainly, I just thought I'd .. You spy on me. You came here to spy on me. You must have said something unforgivable to Mandy. Of course I can understand your capacity for that. She's devastated. Not so devastated that she lost her sense of direction. She made straight for the library. Alright. It is her library. She can make for it if she likes. I hear you are collaborating. I can't work around here. I can't think in this atmosphere. I'm writing the beginning, the most important part of my play. I'm going someplace where I can think. Where is he going? Central Park. - I am going with him. Philo. I think you should ask this woman to leave your house. Leave my house. You are my witness. I did my duty. I took him when he came from Redfield. Amanda came from Posaic. He didn't even know how to put a nickel in a subway slot. Amanda never had a nickel. I told him what to eat. I sent him to a tailor. I sent Amanda to a tailor. I haven't seen the tailor since. I worked with him. I ironed out a thousand and one rough spots. You made him what he is today. I hope Amanda is satisfied. I am sorry, Philo. I guess Amanda sets the style. I could have cried all over your nice living-room. Here, come now. You mustn't. Here. After all. Now please don't do that. I don't want to lose him. Well, I don't want to lose Amanda either, for a totally different reason. I don't want my tombstone cluttered with the names of my formerly beloved wives. It would leave no room for the more important data. Please now, you mustn't. Please don't do that. I would rather you wouldn't. I beg your pardon, sir. It is ten-thirty. Here is your hot milk, sir. Thank you. Will you have a glass of hot milk? - No. There now. Please. There now. What are you giggling at? I don't remember any funny lines. That there one. That's not supposed to be funny. That is very serious. It is? It sounds awful funny to me. Anything else seem funny to you about this play? Sure. There ain't no part in it for me. How about me? The only part I can play is the 85-year old grandmother. And that's only a bit part. [ Telephone ] Hello. Mr Esterbrook? We ain't seen him. We ain't seen him last night either. He didn't come home. That is right, Clementine. Tell them what we had for dinner too. Ha. You don't have to worry about him. He ain't dead. He couldn't be. He sent us a play of his to read. Clementine. Who? What did you say your name was? Mrs Amanda Swift? Alright. I'll tell him. Who is that Mrs Swift? Does she belong to that Mr Swift that was here? His wife. It seems like we're getting them Swifts in our hair. Clementine, you are psychic. What do you mean playing around with that Mrs Swift? I returned Rose-petal, to perform one final rite. She sounds so wispy, just like she won't last out the winter. One final rite Wisteria, which will afford me intense pleasure. She talks so gaspy. What she got, the asthma? You odious barbarian. One more word out of you and I will annihilate you. Don't make up to me. I am off of you. You are fired. You understand that? Now get out of here right away. My final act in this trenchant establishment. Now clear out. And this time you are fired for good. Golly, boss. The way Miss Linda feels about you now, you is lucky you ain't fired. I knows Miss Lindy. And I is warning you, boss. Her patience has just about run out. It is, huh? Yeah it is. And you had better take a tip from me and make up to her pretty. Alright. Now get out of here or I'll hit you with this decanter. Yeah? - So help me. Boss, you are such a lush. You'd never throw that decanter. Not as long as it's got liquor in it. You are just naturally no good. But I hate to see you go. I'll see what I can do for you with Miss Lindy. Good morning, darling. Morning. Your pyjamas need a little pressing. Alright. No clowning if you don't mind. Alright. No clowning. I'm sorry you didn't sleep well, dear. I did. You're a wholesale liar. You likely stayed up all night worrying about me. Right, let's get it over with. What is the idea of staying out all night and so on and so on and so on? I didn't worry about you at all. What harm could come to you in Central Park? You are a law-abiding citizen. No doubt you kept off the grass. Are you through with this thing, Miss Lindy? Yes. Shall I give it back to the Indian? No. Just leave it on the table there. I could write better than that. I could even spell better than that. That's enough of that now, Clementine. Better get busy about your housework. That won't take long today. I ain't got but one bed to make. Alright, you've read it. What do you think? Well. If you lie to me I'll break your neck. This is the biggest moment in my life. This is my first chance to do something really worthwhile. People have laughed at my comedies and gotten up and gone home. But they'll be stirred by this play. And they'll stay in their seats and yell "Author". And don't think I haven't got a curtain speech prepared because I have. I can do all this with this play. Linda, what do you think? Gay, it isn't easy to say in a word. Although I assure you I know the word. For heaven's sake will you tell me? You really want to know what I think? No. Thanks at least for being honest. Darling, why not let people who do know something of immortality write about it? Maybe they have inside information. Gay, I beg of you. Don't throw away your charming gift for comedy. Comedy? With the world upside down? How can you hope to improve matters by writing a bad play? Why is it a bad play? Is it because there isn't a good part in it for you? Is that your standard? Gay. Because you had nothing to do with it? Because it was Amanda's idea and she helped me with it? Well, I could see Amanda's hand in the play. I might add, Amanda's heavy hand. I suppose you think Amanda is a complete idiot. I think she is a clever idiot. But an idiot just the same. I can't stand it any longer. I can't stand you any longer. You and your beautiful superiority. You can't even be humanly jealous. That's what you think. Well, at least Mandy is human. Obviously. I am going to marry Mandy. With my blessings. - You think I joke? I think you're childish. - I know you do. It's your most endearing trait. - I've always known it. It has happened then, has it? With who? Yes. I simply can't believe it somehow. Why? You are not in love with her. You can't be in love with her. I simply can't believe you are in love with her. You can't? Well, nevertheless I am in love with her. Would you love me Gay if I praised the play? Would you love me if I could look you in the eye and lie to you like Amanda does? I will practice. I'll tell you what you can do. You can preen yourself. You can revel in your own superiority. And you can pity us for this childish emotion in which it has involved us. You don't need me. You don't need anybody. You are self-sufficient. You don't need anybody but your press agent. Please don't say those things to me, Gay. And then you can return and gaze at yourself always in a full-length mirror. Alright, Gay. You can go to Amanda. You have my permission. I enjoyed being married to that boy from Redfield. But the successful writer who suddenly becomes profound, I gladly relinquish. Goodbye, Gay. Goodbye. So we can part friends, I .. I give you into the custody of Clementine. What kind of talk is that? He. He hasn't gone away has he, Miss Linda? "In the audience will be Linda Paige." "The actress wife of Esterbrook." "Who will leave immediately after the performance for Reno." "Where she will free herself from the playwright to marry banker Philo Swift." Turn if off will you, Philo. Did you send a telegram to Gay wishing him luck? Yes. I sent him a telegram but I forget what I wished him. I wonder how Gay is taking the news that you and I are .. I am interested from a purely scientific view. I don't know first-hand but I ran into Morgan Carrell the other day. He seemed to know. - Really? What did he say? Gay thought it would be a great marriage for the two critics, the two sceptics. He said we'd produce a lot of question marks. Oh. First act, please. First act. Why don't you come and sit in a corner with me and hold my hand. Men find that soothing. Amanda, will you please go away. You can't be worried about the play? - Yes, I can. But Gay, it is such a wonderful play. - What do you know about it? Curtain going up. Isn't it thrilling. Sorry. I'm always this way opening night. Now, you watch the play from the wings. After it is all over I have got plans. An excursion to Boulder Dam. See you at the intermission. It seems to be holding. Well, nobody has walked out yet. [ Audience laughter ] [ Audience laughter ] Do you hear that? They shouldn't be laughing. This is a serious play. Maybe you should have put a note in the program telling them that. What happened to Esterbrook? It's a serious play but I can't take it seriously. The second act was no better than the first. I didn't know when to laugh and when not to. I'm not taking any chances. I am laughing. Pretty awful, isn't it. It wouldn't be so bad if people didn't laugh so much. It keeps waking me up. Poor Gay. He was so sure he had a hit. He has a curtain speech all prepared. I never thought I'd see the day when I felt sorry for a playwright. Two acts is enough for me. Don't see why we should stick around for a third. Well, the third might be a little better. At least it's understandable. It's a plea for the human race against dictatorships. That doesn't interest me either. I feel Esterbrook sees the world not as it is but as he wants it to be actually. Gay's indignation is sentimental. Romantic. Infantile. Curtain going for the third act. No time to argue now. I directed this play and I've got to sit through it. And the punishment fits the crime. I'll call a cab, my dear. - I'm staying, Philo. Are you angry with me? No. You are. No. Only it has made me see. I am afraid, Philo. It's made me see. What? Well, I thought you and I .. You and I: never. You are independent, secure. Idle and content. Gay, whatever his absurd little faults may be. Whatever he is. He feels. He bleeds. You don't bleed, Philo. Then you are angry at what I said. - No. No. Not angry. You are logical. You are right. I suppose Gay is all the things you say. Sentimental. Romantic. Even infantile. But not all together. I just can't believe it all together. There must be millions in the past. And now, millions of anonymous people who .. Who are kind. Who ask only to be permitted to live. All those voices, those humble voices unheard and unrecorded. One must believe in them. Or then one must do illogical and quixotic things. One must write plays pointing out their plight. Perhaps not Gay. It is not his field. But others should. Excuse me. It is not your fault. I always thought it was a silly play. Why on earth do you waste your talent on stuff like this? You know, I have a curious feeling that you have latent powers. Do you really think so? - I certainly do. And I should like nothing better than to help you develop them. Author. Author! Speech. Speech! Thank you. Thank you very much for the way you have received my .. My little offering. The fact that there were laughs where there should have been tears. The fact the theater emptied in less than 2 minutes with no mention of fire. This, I attribute to the sunspots. Which, of late have been turning everything topsy-turvy. I would like to take this opportunity also to thank the members of my cast. Who by now .. Thanks to me. Are safely lodged in the ranks of the unemployed. It reminds me of the old fable about a frog who wanted to be as big as an ox. So he .. Managed to swell himself up to three times his normal size. And he burst. So that. In this. The hour of my .. Peculiar triumph. I .. Gay. Okay .. after all .. Four hits. Just one flop to prove you are human. That is a very nice way of saying "I told you so" Linda. Gay, the most wonderful idea came to me right after the second act intermission. Why don't you a comedy? A satire on all the smug, contented, callous tough-shirts. People who think dictators are inevitable. Who say the average man is bloodthirsty and contemptible. Gay, you can set the whole world to laugh at these people. Gay, listen. In the second scene a woman enters. A beautiful radiant woman who .. I see you have already written in a part for yourself. Yes, of course. Or I wouldn't have thought of the play in the first place. But Gay, what about it? Isn't it an exciting idea? I see you're starting right from the beginning. Going to make a successful playwright out of you. No, no. I am starting from the successful playwright that will take you back .. To the boy from Redfield Minnesota. Wait a minute, though. What about Philo Swift? Well, now. If you are going to start that, what about Amanda? Oh. Well, she walked out on me. I saved the family honor. I walked out on him. You did? - Uhuh. Well, what do you know. Gay. Stand here next to me. You really walked out on him, huh? Uhuh. Gosh. All those seats. Now, if we are really starting from the beginning. Excuse me. Where are you going? - To get you a pack of cigarettes. Well, wait a minute. I didn't give you the money. - No. It's alright. Here's a quarter. And you can keep the change. Gosh, I haven't kissed you for two months. That is nothing to brag about. I think our love is immortal. -(Ro)-
