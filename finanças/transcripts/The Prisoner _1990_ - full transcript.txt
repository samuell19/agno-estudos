Andrew! I missed you so much! Hey, everyone's looking. Let them look. OK, let's go. Welcome back, Andy. Thanks. To your good health, Professor. I had you transferred from Hong Kong, because I need your help on a case. It might involve a high ranking officer in the police department. I need someone with a new face to go undercover. You'll be reporting to Jerry. OK. Papa, stop talking business and start eating, or all the food will go to waste. All right, we'll discuss this tomorrow. Come on now, dig in. Yes, sir. Cheers. Cheers. He's only been home a few hours and already you're trying to get him drunk. Sally cares about you. I should be the one proposing the toast. I used to just hang around here until Jerry sent me to reform school. Then the Professor helped me and sent me to study at the police academy. If it wasn't for you two, I wouldn't be here today. To both of you. Thank you, sir. Shall I walk you to your car? No, thanks. It's just there. Good night, Professor. Good night, Jerry. I'll take Andy back to his hotel. You get to bed. Good night, Professor. I'll see you tomorrow. I'd better get going. You'd better get back and get some rest. Come on. All right. Who's visiting the Professor so late? Hold it! "Fingerprint of Suspect" "Fingerprint Number:" "Match Number:" "Carl Chan, executed January 10th, 1987." Strange, how could our murderer have been executed three months ago? How could this be, Jerry? It was a well planned hit. Using a supposed dead man to commit a murder. Either someone's been messing with the computer, or there's something up at the jail. Don't dwell on it, Andy. I'm OK. You go home if you want. I want to be alone for a while. OK, then. I'll head off, then. Bye. See you. Give me some stuff, Ronnie. Got the money? It's all gone. That's bullshit! Sell your body, then. I can't stand it! Get lost! Boss, someone's looking at you. What are you looking at? Do you think it's worth it? We've checked it out. The computer is secure. The prison is our only clue. I've got to do it. You might get killed. I'll take the risk. And what about Sally? Don't tell her anything until I've finished this case. I won't. But assault and battery is serious. You'll be in for two years. For your safety in prison, no one can know who you are, apart from you and me. Operation Hunter. Take these. I'll inform you of the rules here.

A great success. Your shoes. You know better than to wear these with me. Not bad. I've got the touch today. Think about it. Kiki! I'm sorry. I ran all the way. Don't be mad at me. I'm so sorry, really. I'm sorry. I forgive you. Let's grab a bite to eat. So you think you're a big shot? What do you want? No, Kiki. Let go of her! Let's go. Kiki! Kiki! Someone help! Her kidney is badly damaged. You'll need $200,000 to cover her bills. If we don't operate now, we may not be able to save her. Where can I get it at this hour? Doctor, can you do the operation first? I'm sorry. Hospital policy. I can't help you. Do what you can to raise the money. I'm out! What's your bet? It's all I've got. I call. I see you. Full house. I win. See you. Hold it!

Never go against the officers! Never try to escape! No raping of other inmates... Charlie, what are the odds for tonight? No bet. Not tonight. Why not?

Calm down, Steve! Let go! It's all right. Let me go. Let me go! Take him to the sickroom. Yes, sir. Superintendent, those guys were trying to kill Steve. No way, sir. Those guys were fighting, we tried to separate them. Better tell the truth. It is the truth. He's got the knife on him. You're lying. No, he's not, Superintendent. I can prove he's telling the truth. Here's the knife they used. Listen up, no screwing up in my place. Take them in. Get going! Write me a report. You can come out now. Lucas. Don't screw up again. Going against me is like going against God. We respect our God. We don't respect you. There's no comparison. You're back! My brothers, never surrender! Come in. You asked for me, boss? Sit down. I hear you've been asking about Carl Chan. Are you an informer? No. I was looking at your hands. You've got a well developed trigger finger. No one's heard of you. So the way I see it, you're a snitch. I'm not! Talk! What is it with you? In the service, I was selected for the Olympic shooting competition. That's why I have strong hands. And Carl Chan? We served together in the army. He owes me some money. You're lying. Lucas! I won't yell out. I won't get the guards after you. Please, believe me. Enough! If you're really here to settle a debt, Carl Chan's dead so forget it. His slate is clean. You watch what you're doing. Your life is in my hands. Andy! Over here. Right. Oh, sorry. Use your spoon. Yeah. What's wrong with your hand? I cut it in the shop. Oh, yeah? No more food till I get the truth. Come get it when you're ready to talk. Thanks, Lucas, but I'm being watched. So you're great friends? No appetite. Bring the rice pot. Yes, sir. Move! Now let's have some fun. You'd better eat it all, or it's another ten days in the hole. Lucas, save some for me. You've all come here to work, not to sunbathe! I won't tolerate any goofing around. If you're not able to complete the road, there'll be no dinner tonight. Officer Chang, what if we finish early? Can we break then? Finish early! And I'm a pig! There's no way you'll finish early. Now get to work! Hey, friend, take it easy. It's a long road. You heard what he said. If we finish early, he'll turn into a pig. Hey, listen up. If we finish early, somebody will turn into a pig! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on, guys. Let's move it! Hurry it up! Some water, sir? Are they crazy? I don't know. OK, let's go! Come on, brothers! We're almost done. Are they on drugs? They're two hours ahead of schedule. Anyone here see an angry pig? Get in there, hurry up. Hey, did you see your son? Yeah. He's growing up so fast, I hardly recognized him. I promised I'd visit him at New Years'. Next time don't get caught. Every time they bring you back and they give you another year. At this rate, you'll never get out. One day I'll escape for good. My son and I will sail away on a boat. Where will you go? The Philippines. Living costs are low there. A few dollars will get you a virgin. Keep her for a month and you get a discount, and she does the housework. What do you want her for? The usual stuff, you know, cooking and cleaning... that kind of thing. No wonder you want to escape. Let me know if you get another chance. A live-in maid! Now that's good for your health. Boss, sir. Glasses on. She's not wearing any bra. Boss, sir! Cleaning glasses. Dear Lord, whatever I've done wrong, please don't strike me blind now. Oh, shit! I can't see anything with these glasses. Boss, sir! Taking off glasses. Why don't any of you help me? Hey, John! Go help her. Yes, sir! Hi, miss. Thank you. Don't mention it. It's no bother...! Are you all right? I'm OK. You can break my bones, but don't strike me blind. Don't stand there. I need you to push the car from over there. Lean against the window and rock it. All right, place your bets, gentlemen on one, two or three. Hurry up, the race is about to start. Come on, place your bets, then stand back. Come on, everyone, place your bets here. Come on... Hey, John, how'd that girl look up close? Was she fine? She was better than fine, she was inspiring. I didn't need a jack to change her tyre. Really? Of course not. All right, all bets in. Ready... Go! You bet on number two and you lost it all. Johnny, can I have just two? Two? Here! One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight... Li's man is out! In here I'm the boss. I know all about you and Boss Li. But what happens on the outside stays on the outside. Understand? When you're in here, it doesn't matter who you are. We're all together in this. I don't want any feuds in here. Lucas, Boss Li's brother's dead. It's blood for blood. I'll bleed for him. Andy, have you seen my mouse? Maybe he's asleep in the mattress again. I'll help you look after we eat. Thanks. Hey, that's not enough. Why? Why? Why? Why did you do it? Why did you do it to him? He cooked my mouse! In the hole with him. Here, I got it! Better keep away from him. Here, take this. I'm not hungry. Boss? I got to do the business. Great timing! Make sure you go downwind. Let me know where you are. Yes, sir. Shoot. I'm here! I'm here! I'm still here! I'm still shitting! Don't tell me that, just shake the grass. We're eating here! OK, I'm moving the grass now, boss. Don't let him get away! After him! Maybe we can find ourselves a boat at dawn. I heard your son broke his leg playing football. Is he all right? He's a kid. He'll be fine in a few days. It's almost New Year. Time flies. Yeah, time flies. Why? I'm sorry. I had to see my son. I promised I'd see him at New Years'. They said I could if we turned ourselves in. Nothing will happen. Lucas! Lucas! Why? Why'? You said we'd just get a few days in the hole! I don't negotiate with convicts. Take him away. Yes, sir. I'll report you! I don't think you'll be seeing your son. And if anyone hears you sold Lucas out, you'll die a terrible death. Get him out of here! Come on! Wake up! Everybody up! Wake up! Come on! This is what happens when you break the rules. Even though John went along with Lucas' escape plan, when we caught up with him, he surrendered and said he was sorry. He went for the sake of his son's broken leg. We forgive him. We are not as unreasonable as you think. We'll be watching him closely and if he behaves, we'll forget about this. A potato a day won't make you fat, but will keep you healthy to fight another day Charlie. Boss, Eddie's out of jail. He's in the back room. I'll go talk to him. Sit down. How's everything? Steve's not dead, he's injured so they're keeping him in the sickroom. We couldn't get him. What are my men doing? It seems as if Lucas got involved. Brother, Eddie just got out of jail. Make him comfortable. Alfred, get Eddie set up in the casino. Enjoy yourself. Thanks. Well? What is it? That bastard Steve. He's still alive and walking around. God dammit! Teddy died for nothing. That bastard! Boss, let me do it! Some water, sir? Here, boss, have some more noodles. You eat. I'll do this. Snake! Snake! Go! Freddy's dead. Get him out, hurry! Yes, sir.

The judgment of this court is that he be executed forthwith. ID cards everyone. Come on. Get in line. Lieutenant, what's up? Inspector, what's all this about? Routine check. Oh, yeah? Why now? You only gave my daughter $5,000 as a wedding gift. If I check here often, you lose business. You lose business, you lose money. This is a nice place. It'd be a real shame to have to close it down. Really sad. OK, how much do you want? Five hundred dollars and two zeros. All right, I'll pay you. Come with me. Hey, brother, what's up'? Make him out a cheque for $50,000. Right. Thanks a lot So you're welcome. Have a meal you eat, a person is impossible to finish Do you have any command, I'll do it We're all good friends here. You can't come between us. Now, listen. Choose a day and I'll take you out to dinner. I, ah... I think I'll come back tomorrow. What did you do that for? I thought we were friends. No need to fight. A zero here or there, what does it matter? I'm sorry we made you suffer. I just need to get into the jail. Thank you. The cheque. $50,000 less a zero or two. You're going to do this favor for me.

It is the high court's decision that Andy Wong shall be executed by firing squad. This is your funeral. That's where you're buried. Here's your death certificate. We've kept you alive to work for us. You're now a member of the Executive Committee. We've been watching you for a long time. You're a survivor with a strong sense of justice, though misguided. Society is becoming complex. There are too many criminals on the street. And too many loopholes. They always seem to find a way to escape punishment. The Executive Committee is in existence solely to deal with these criminals. Blood begets blood, filth begets filth. Your Government has given you the honor of joining this team. When your assignment is through, we'll give you a passport and a new identity. You can go anywhere you want start all over again. In fact, you don't have a choice. You're already dead. This is your only chance. This mission is your life. This assignment is an assassination. The target is Colonel Sama. The biggest drug dealer in Southeast Asia. He's being brought in to stand trial. But we know he's paid off all the judges. Before he boards his plane, we must execute him. Each of you has been issued two guns. When you have accomplished your mission, you'll find a jeep waiting for you directly behind you, 800 meters away. Leave immediately. Someone will meet you at the gate and give you your passports and airline tickets. Let's gm! Come on, get in! There's a bomb in the car. Jump! Do not kill me! Don't!

Then killing them when they're through. A very clever plan. You didn't realise I'd come back alive. I knew you would. I'll give you some money, you can go wherever you want. No one will be the wiser. What do you say? That's a real good plan. There's just one thing... Why did you do it? That drug dealer was my partner. I'd be dead if he testified. What about Professor Leung? Why did you kill him? He was investigating me and he was getting too close. Here they are. It's a lot of money. And tomorrow I can send you a lot more. It's all yours, Andy. You make me sick. So many good men killed. Aw, Andy, don't be stupid. You couldn't earn this much money in a lifetime. Thousands die every day, what difference does a few more make? What difference? Can you pay for all of them? The price is too high! Bastard! I serve God, not you. I'm going to kill you! Andy! Don't.
