Be advised we're switching frequencies to communicate with ground units, over. - [Narrator] New York, city of more, more Italians than in Rome, more Jews than in Tel Aviv, more Irish than in Dublin. There's also more money, more traffic, more garbage, more nuts, and especially more crime. [dramatic music] [door slams] [grapple clasps] [engaging suspenseful music] - All right listen get that guard and put that nitric acid in the van. - I got ya. [suspenseful dramatic music] [guard thuds] [guard struggles for breath and moans] [dark dramatic music] [guard chatters indistinctly] - I'll check back with you in about five minutes, alright? [gun shot] [glass shatters] [alarm blares] - Jesus. Let's get the hell out of here. - Get out of here, Jerry you're with us. [police siren blares] I'll handle this. - Freeze! Check out the van partner. [engine revs] [tires screech] [gun shots] - Wait to go Jerry. - Get in the van Pat and I'll move the cop car. [dramatic music] [gun shot] - [Melton] That's the second chemical company they've knocked over this week only this time they killed two of our men and two guards. - Well nobody pulls two jobs like that for just a few hundred bucks, there's gotta be something else. Was there any property lost? - Well we don't know their entire inventory but they didn't take anything that could be used to make PCP or other narcotics. We've got all of our available teams on it. - We you get that inventory check get it to me as fast as you can. - Right. - And get me, get me Calhoun. - Calhoun? You know he creates more problems than he solves. I'm sorry but his total disregard for the rules keeps internal affairs on overtime. - Get me Calhoun. [police siren blares] [engaging dramatic music] - What do you got Tom? - I got a psycho holding his wife and a nurse with a shotgun. - His name is Thomas Grant; he's an outpatient. His wife came down to have him committed and he came back a few minutes later with a shotgun and he says he's gonna kill everybody and he just might do it. - Give me your coat. - I beg your pardon. - Just give me your coat. - Are you crazy Calhoun? SWAT's on route. - Yeah so is judgment day Tom. - Come on, hurry. [patients yell frantically] - Listen shut up! You're making my head pound. - Tommy please don't do this. - Don't antagonize him Mrs. Grant. - I said shut up! [suspenseful music] - I have to think. - Take all the time you want Mr. Grant. [gun shot] - No need to shoot Tommy. I'm Dr. Case I'm hear to talk to you. - You don't wanna talk to me. You want to put me away. - No Tommy I don't wanna put you away, I just wanna help. Now what the hell happened to all my pencils? Look you have to understand Tommy I'm not quite like all the other doctors around here. They've been unfair to you I understand. I can help. - Please Tommy, listen to him. - He knows what he's talking about Mr. Grant. - You don't know-- [Mrs. Grant and the Nurse scream] - No one is going to put you away. One, I won't let them. Two, I've reviewed your chart. Somebody has made a terrible mistake. Now why don't we just let these people go so you and I can sit down and talk about it. - I'm gonna kill em! - No! - You are not going to kill anybody. Now listen to me, now stop it. Stop. Now I want you to read something. Tommy, I want you to read this. Okay, I want you to listen to me. 'Cause I'm gonna tell you something. Now they can't help you, now it's not because they don't want to but they don't know how. I do, now if you just give me a chance I'll have you out of here and I'll have you home in no time at all. - Stay where you are! [Mrs. Grant sobs] - Why don't the two of you get out of here so Tommy and I can talk, alright Tommy? - You're confusing me. - Look Tommy I understand. Look you have no right to listen to a conversation between a doctor and a patient. Get the hell out of here. - He's right Mrs. Grant, let's give them some privacy. [Mrs. Grant screams] [Tommy screams] [gun shot] [suspenseful music] - Look, I'm sorry I had to lie to you Tommy, but I had no choice. Look you're gonna get all the help you need. I guarantee it. - I don't, I don't even know why I did it. I don't even know. - Come on son. - It's gonna be okay, I promise you, yeah. Are you all right, hmm? - Nice job in there, can I take that for you sir? Are you all right? He's something huh? - Yeah he sure is, nut with a gun in there. - Close call. - That guy's nuts in there. - Another one man show big shot? - You can't argue with success. - Report to Chief Evans. - The price of messenger service seems to be getting awfully high. [engaging uptempo music] How the hell did you find this place? - It's a long story, here try some of this, try that's snake. - I've got plenty of time, the squid is good. - Well I don't have plenty of time. I've got something pretty heavy for ya. - I thought you'd like it. What is it? - The chemical company warehouse down on 4th Street. - Two cops, two guards killed eh? - That's right. Put a little ginger in there with your plant. They have Staph and Laughner on in right now with an assist from homicide but I want you to work on it independently. - Independently, why? - I don't know, something funny's going on. Two chemical companies in the past week and all they got for it was peanuts. - I'll be damned. - Oh. - You got it. - You be careful with that. That's so hot it will peel off the wallpaper. [dramatic music] - [Omar] God it hurts! I need help. I don't think this is a plan. I'll do anything you ask. Please help me. - When are we gonna know if this works? - Soon little brother, soon. - As long as it takes some jerk to count out five million bucks. [razor taps] - Take the mic, let's go. [intense action music] You stupid idiot I told you to cool it until the tapes are finished. - I need it now, please. - Hey, hey do what he says Omar or I'll shove that pipe up your nose. - I need a little just to relax so I can do a good job! - You do a good job first! Or you'll never do another one. - As soon as you do this right we'll give you some okay? - Please and more for later. - All you want, just do it like I told you. [dramatic music] Here. - Last night's bombing was our way of proving the capabilities of the United Front. In order to protect your bank headquarters and all branches from more explosions at a time when they are occupied you will do as we tell you. [uptempo action music] [car horns honk] [shoes tap lightly] [dramatic music] - Miss Calhoun's a mean lady. She's a doctor, a shrink, [speaks foreign language]. [light dramatic music] [door knocks] - It's open. [sensuous jazz music] - Hey mister. I was sent by Adorable Outcall as you requested. - Yeah, well you don't look so adorable to me, besides, you're late. Tell me something, how much this gonna cost me? - 200 bucks and that doesn't include tip. - [Calhoun] 200 bucks? Gee, what can I get for 25 dollars? - You wouldn't spend 25 dollars on me even for a meal. - Don't... - Hey baby. - Touch me. - Oh, I'd love to do a number on her. - You'll get your chance Jerry but I need her first so I can get Calhoun then you can have her. - Guess what? I have an offer from Santa Barbara Hospital. They want me to head up their psychiatric unit. - The only Santa Barbara I know is in California. - That's right. - Now what the hell am I supposed to do when you're in Santa Barbara? - You know how you can stop me. - Oh and I thought you wouldn't marry a cop? - That's right. [bomb explodes] - Morning, Mr. Beardsly. - Good morning everyone, I'm glad you could all make it. Undoubtedly you've all heard about the explosion. It was not the boiler that blew up last night it was a bomb. This tape was delivered to my home this morning. - [Omar] Last night's bombing was our way of proving the capabilities of the United Front. In order to protect your bank headquarters and all branches from more explosions at a time when they are occupied you will do as we tell you. It is a small amount for you imperialist swine to pay for all the evil you have done us. You will pay five million dollars. Further instructions will be provided. - Our responsibility is banking. I suggest we let the experts in terrorism do their job. - Yeah, perhaps but what about the threat to a great many lives while the experts muddle through their bureaucratic red tape? - I hope you're not suggesting we accede to terrorist demands? - I'm suggesting we keep our options open. - And if we capitulate what do they do next? - But I'm not suggesting we capitulate. But we must be pragmatic. Our concern is the present threat and remember we have 312 banks around the world that are vulnerable. We can't act hastily. - We can't compromise with international gangsters. If we give in now they'll keep coming back. Eventually we'll be financing World War III. - What will the stockholders say? - This is not a decision to be made by stockholders and I pray to God I never have to make it myself. [ominous music] - All right, let's go. [truck beeps] [car smashes] - What the hell are you guys doing here? What do you think the light-- - Shut up! [man moans in agony] I hate pushy people. - Get him Pat, get him, fast! [intense action music] [man gasps for breath] [dramatic music] - Hey, no, no, please, no, no! [phone rings] - Calhoun. Where? I'm on my way. I gotta go. - Hey, you promised. - I can't be in two places at once. - Well you could try. You're gonna regret this in about six hours. - You mean six minutes. [engaging dramatic music] What have we got Sid? - A stab wound to the heart, M.O. similar to other two chemical company jobs. - So bad dudes. - Baddest. - What else have you got? - Got some broken glass, got tire tracks close enough together to indicate a possible accident. - Which means it might have been a blue car. - Which means that blue paint might have been there for two years. - Which means you'll check it out for me. - That's what I like about you Calhoun, you're subtle. - Yeah that's what they tell me. Look, I'll call you in the morning. [car revs] [bomb explodes] - I thank you all for coming into the office so very early this morning. As I told you on the phone the authorities are most anxious to discuss the circumstances with us. - Captain Melton. - Hi. - Beardsly. - Excuse my glove, gentleman and ladies, agents Wilkins and Spradley of the FBI. [dramatic music] - What's that? - A reward. - Yeah this combination would fatten anyone, even you. - Well you don't get both, pick one. So what's the good news? - You know I'm supposed to give that report to Melton first. - Well by the time I get it from Melton I'll be retired. He's not one of my fans. - One of your fans? He thinks you belong in a penitentiary. - He thinks everyone belongs in a penitentiary. The unfortunate thing is he never puts anybody inside. [phone rings] Look Sid, I hate to do this but I need this information and I need it fast. - I made a positive identification on the paint transfer. It's a recovered, stolen Dodge. - What did I tell you, you're a genius. - True, the bad news is I was only able to lift a couple of partial prints. - Alright, well run 'em through and see what you come up with. - Oh come on Calhoun, I'm up to my neck in work already, besides Melton would kill me if he knew I was doing special work for you. - Look Sid, what I need is important. You're just gonna have to take my word for it. - All right, next time make it a steak. - Restaurant of your choice. - Oh Calhoun, Evans sent these invoices down for ya. - Just what I'm looking for, thanks a lot. [engaging dramatic music] - Yo. - You looking to party? - You know damn well what I'm looking for. - I ain't free, honey. - Nothing that good's ever cheap, get in. [van revs] [light dramatic music] - Nitro. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, but what you fail to explain is why pros are going to so much trouble for a few hundred bucks. As usual Calhoun you're chasing gremlins. - The burglaries were set up to hide the real targets. The Castle job, a large quantity of glycerine was taken, Schultz, nitric acid, and at Santos, cellulose comes up missing. - All right, get to the point Calhoun. - You mix those components together and you get nitroglycerine. - Nitroglycerine, right, that's what I was afraid of. They've got enough explosives here to blow up half the city. - You got it. - Get that FBI report. - You gonna share that with him? - Get it Melton, get it! Got intelligence from the FBI, a couple of terrorist organizations they think are trying to set up base here in New York City. - Hell, I just hope the clock isn't against us on this one. - It always is. - Ain't that the truth. [engaging dramatic music] [sewing machines operate] - Six months I don't see ya and now the busiest time of the year you gotta come and bust my chops. - Just a matter of priorities Mel. - Priorities my foot. - Excuse me. - How you doing Izzy? - Fine, whatever you're look for Calhoun I didn't do it. - Hey just take it easy, he just wants to ask you a few questions. - Izzy, you still running around with your Libyan buddies on the Upper East Side. - Once in a while, why? - What do you know about the United Liberation Front? - Hey wait a minute Calhoun, since I got my green card I don't mess with people like that. I got a kid on the way. I wouldn't screw up my future messing with those crazies. - Izzy, Izzy, relax will ya, I believe you. The point is you know these people. Now would they be planning something that could involve a couple of hundred bombs? - A couple of hundred bombs? [Izzy laughs] - Are you kidding? If they had more than two bombs in their hands they'd blow themselves to bits. [phone rings] - Yeah, this is Silverman. Just a minute, it's for you. - Thanks Mel. - Calhoun. [muffled voice speaks from phone] Tell him I'll be there in 15 minutes. Mel, thanks a lot. Izzy I wanna hear from ya. Good seeing ya Mel. - Libya, I thought you was Egyptian. - I lied, am I fired? - Izzy get back to work. [intense action music] [tires screech] - Hey turkey, up against the car. - Who me? - You! - You talking to me, say did you hear what he called me? Can you believe that? - Up against the car, motormouth, now. The rest of you turkeys take a walk unless you wanna ride with your pal, now! - You ain't got no right to be talking trash to me. What is this? What are you busting me for, huh? - Highway mopery with intent to shuck and jive, now shut up! - I'll be back in an hour. - Get your butt in the car. - Hey Calhoun, you cool but these cuffs are tight. - Maybe your wrists are getting too fat Floyd. I got a problem Floyd. The Commissioner and the FBI are convinced that the terrorists blew up that bank building the other night, I don't agree. Now are there any bombers around? - Yeah there's Billy Adler or maybe Mike Felix. Hey wait a minute, do you remember those psycho, jive bombers the Bantams? - Yeah. - Didn't you put 'em away a couple of years ago? - Yeah they're up in Matteawan. - Uh uh, they got paroled and they're badder than ever. Busted up an old man over a nose candy deal. - They used explosives on the bank job when I nailed them. They weren't supposed to be released for another four years. - They just work the system man. They're gonna be after your butt for sure. - What else have you heard about them? - Word's out they gave Jimmy Riley a score to steal a car for 'em. - That's the connection. Do you have any idea where that little wimp is staying. - I heard he's holed up in a shooting pad at Avenue C and 5th. - Outstanding my man, I owe ya. - I'll think of something. - Yeah I'm sure you will. - But for now could you drop me at Lennox and 110th. - Yes sir.

I thought it belonged to the owner of the car. - A blue Dodge? - How did you know? - Where did you deliver it? Where did you deliver it? - Right outside on the corner. The Bantams came and picked it up. - Don't you call anybody Riley or I'll be back and believe me that's the last thing you want. - What are you doing?

[muffled conversations] [slow dramatic music] [door knocks] [speaks foreign language] Who is it? - Calhoun. - Come in please. He's very frightened. - Who is he? - A member of the United Liberation Front, he wants out. - Do you speak English? - No, I will interpret. - All right ask him why he wants to talk to me. [speaks foreign language] [speaks foreign language] - He wants asylum. - Why didn't he go to the feds? [speaks foreign language] [speaks foreign language] - He's already informed them that the ULF found out. He needs protection Calhoun. - When is the ULF planning the bomb? - Calhoun? - Ask him! [speaks foreign language] [speaks foreign language] - They're not going to bomb anything. They're here to raise money. - You believe him? - His fears are real Calhoun. I assure you, he's not lying. - Alright I'm gonna give you the home number of a friend of mine in the State Department. Just tell him I told you to call. You two stay put until they come for him. - Thanks Calhoun. Was he of any help? - Yeah, as a matter of fact he was. Tell him I hope he makes it. [speaks foreign language] - Oh and good luck with the baby. - Thank you. [intense dramatic music] [crowd murmurs] - Enough? - Not enough. - L'chaim - L'chaim. That is good Irish whiskey. - Only the best. - Look, I need some help Hop Sing. I'm looking for three brothers, the Bantams. One of them is a stoned psycho with a heavy habit and he likes his snow pure. - Any idea where they might be scoring? - That's what I need. - I'll see what I can do.

[threatening music] - We have a message for your husband. But first. [Lynette screams in horror] - The amazing thing is they think by 1992, 62% of the city's gonna be oriental. That's frightening. - What the hell are you talking about frightening? - What if they all decide to open restaurants? - I don't know Hop Sing with some good, healthy competition your food might improve. - [Hop Sing] I may have to switch to hamburgers. What's that matter? - I'm about to become a victim my friend. Stay here. Hey hold this for a minute will ya?

[intense dramatic music] [police siren blares] - Don't bother Sarge, his head's in a body bag in the ambulance. He's a hype named Jimmy Riley, you know him? - Yeah I know him. God dammit. - Here put that map in there. We're almost home, remember no screw ups. You got everything straight? - Oh come on Rog, I ain't no dummy. - I didn't say you were Patty but we just gotta be sure of everything. Now tell me once more please. - Okay Rog, when I get off the boat. - Plane. - When I get off the plane I go to the marina and then I pick up a boat called Our Pleasure and then I sleep on it 'til the day after tomorrow and then I follow the instructions you wrote down. - You know what? - What? - That's perfect. [birds chirp] - I'm very sorry Mr. Beardsly, she'll be all right, just let her sleep okay? [melancholic music] - Don't. [phone rings] - Call coming. Mr. Beardsly it's very important you keep him on as long as possible. Mr. Beardsly? - Yes. - Hello my friend, is the money ready? - You filthy animal. - No delays Mr. Beardsly. We will be in touch with you and your wife, and no police. - I want you out of my house. - Mr. Beardsly you don't understand-- - You don't understand. I have cooperated with you and people are dead. My wife may never recover! I'm going to do whatever they want. - [Evans] The Commissioner and the Mayor are convinced it's terrorists. They wanted me to beef up manpower so you're on your own. - It's okay I prefer it that way. What about the Beardsly's? - Well they dropped another tape, murdered Beardsly's maid and raped his wife. Beardsly of course is refusing to help in any way now. - I should have been a fireman. - Melton's bringing over the tape. Look, Beardsly's wife said that one of guys who raped had a very thick Middle-East accent. - Captain, there's not an actor in the world who can't do an Arab accent. How can you stand anyone that neat? - You pick unique places to meet. - I already I got that. - [Roger] In exactly three days a single-engine two passenger plane is to fly to 73 degrees longitude, 21 minutes latitude and drop the money. Our associates are equipped with transmitters. If anything goes wrong your banks and much of Manhattan will cease to exist. - The location he's referring to is in the Caribbean, where the United Front has close ties. We're closing in on them now. - Jack? - Well you can't ignore the evidence. Look, I need a favor. Pictures of the Bantams, now if I'm right they're not going to trust anyone else to pick up the money for them. So if you could just pass those out to the airport cops and have them alert me if they show up. - Consider it done. Melton, how about a piece of pizza? - No thank you. - It's really very good. - [Dispatcher] The person you're looking for owns Tony's Pizza, 149th and Park. [intense dramatic music] - I hope that dump wasn't too expensive Pizza Man. - Hey man, I don't know what the hell you're talking about. - Okay, I'm talking about the crap you've been peddling around to schools. - Hey man I ain't peddling nothing all right? I run an honest business here. I love kids-- - I got no time for fairy tales where are your new customers the Bantam brothers. - Oh give me, hey listen why don't you just do me a big favor okay, why don't you get the hell out of my store before I throw you out, huh? - Now! [fighting and punching] [intense action music] - All right scumbag it's you and me. Tell me about the Bantams or I'll break your neck. - Hey man, look I don't know I haven't seen 'em in days they've just been hanging around the Village. - More! - They pick up hookers on Times Square every night-- - More! - Come on man give me a break-- - More! - They're not scoring off of me anymore. I ain't seen 'em in a week's time okay. I swear to God. - Mr. Beardsly we are faced with a very grave situation and need your help. Understand, half this city could blow up. - That's your problem. - Unless my men are present when you receive your instructions and can stay on top of their movements we'll never stop them in time. - I won't have any more blood on my hands. - Mr. Beardsly don't be a fool. You can't deal with these men by yourself. They'll be back, and back, and back. What happened to your wife will just be the beginning. - My decision is final, I can't risk your involvement. - What a mistake. - It's too bad. - God dammit. [horns honk] - Look, run them by the local whores. See if you can get me an address as soon as possible. Start with the ones that have been beaten up recently. Jerry Bantam had a bad habit, just pass it around to the other officers in the area alright? [light melancholic music] [sensuous jazz music] [phone rings] [police sirens blare] [intense dramatic music] - Pardon me sir, we'd like to ask you a few questions. - What for? - Let's see your ID. - Oh no, no, no, I ain't got time for this crap. I got a plane to catch. - Hey suppose we go to the security office. - All right, all right. You guys ain't got no right to hassle me man. - When we're not hassling ya, Mr. Bantam. - [Airport Attendant] Last call American Airlines flight 753, departing at gate 18B. All passengers- - That's my flight I gotta go. - You're gonna have to catch the next one. - Oh, you've got to be kidding man-- - I said you're coming with us. - Okay, okay, okay, all right, all right, I'll go, I'll go. [fighting and shooting] [gun shot] [intense action music] [gun shots] [intense chase music] - Police, everybody down! [people scream and cry] Down! Down! [gun shot] Where are your brothers Pat? - You screwed it Calhoun. You think you got us, you're wrong. You just signed a death warrant for the city. [door opens] - Did you get rid of the van? - On the radio, the airport. - What, what the heck you talking about? - There was a shooting, Pat's dead, I know he's dead, I know he's dead-- - Pull yourself together! What the heck are you talking about? - The radio said Calhoun killed somebody at Kennedy Airport. [Bantam brothers sob] - I got here as fast as I could Kelly, where is she? - Four doors down, campus. - Thanks Kelly. [upbeat soul music] [fist taps] - I smell me a cop. - You'll smell like the inside of a jail cell if you don't start answering some questions. - I know my rights, I ain't gotta tell you nothing. - Don't bust my chops Comet. I'll put you away until your hair turns white. - So what do y'all want? - Jerry Bantam. - Gee. - The lunatic who did that to you. I wanna know where he's staying Comet. - Psycho, I don't remember. - No, maybe five years in the joint will help you remember, let's go. - Listen mister, he'd kill me if he found out I was talking. - And what happens if I don't find him Comet? He'll be back. Next time you may not be so lucky. - They ain't gonna be no next time with that psycho. - Don't bet on it. He's found himself a punching bag, Comet. Next time you may not live through it. Listen to me, the only chance you have is to tell me where he's staying. I promise you there is no way he's gonna know you told me. - Riverside Drive, 1702, apartment 45. Do yourself a favor Comet, stay off the streets for a while. - Hey Cop, you kill him. - The name's Calhoun. [uptempo soul music] [foreboding music] [dog barks] [suspenseful music] Oh my God. - We got your call for backup. - It's too late. - They were mixing the stuff right here? - Yep, let me show you something. Take a look at this. - Well I figured they'd use radio control devices. - They are gonna blow the city off the map whether they're paid or not. - And Beardsly's are only hope and he's not talking, unless you can persuade him otherwise Jack. [police sirens blare] - No, I'll only be about 45 minutes. - Short day, doctor? - Breakfast, doctor. [ominous music] [Malone screams] [van revs] [birds chirp] [door shuts] [doorbell rings] - Mr. Beardsly? - Yes. - Detective Jack Calhoun. - I've already spoken to your superiors. What do you want? - I wanna talk to you. - I have nothing more to say; please leave. - We could help each other Mr. Beardsly. It's not gonna cost you a hell of a lot to listen. If you love your wife you'll give me three minutes. - All right, come in. All right, I'm quite busy now, what is it you wanna say to me? - Now just listen to me Mr. Beardsly. The men we're dealing with our murderers, thieves, and drug addicts, they're the same men who attacked your wife, they're not terrorists. Now I know these men, I put them away 10 years ago. - You know these men? Do the police know these men too? - Yes, but we don't have the evidence to put them away and even if we did we can't find them. The point is Mr. Beardsly I need your help and I need it now. [dramatic music] - What do we do now? - What we do first is take care of the stakeout. - Stakeout? [phone rings] - Hello, hello. - [Roger] Have you get the money? - Who is this? - You know who it is now is the money ready or not? - Yes, yes it's ready. - Listen carefully, we've planted enough nitro to blow all the banks and half this city with 'em. Now if you wanna know where the bombs are, make sure there are no mistakes. - Yes. - One other detail, I want a cop named Jack Calhoun to deliver the money personally. Give him the suitcases and tell him to wait for instructions at a phone booth in the 79th street Marina. I want him there in two hours and hey, tell him from me the doctor says hello. [melodramatic music] [phone rings] - Dr. Malone's line. - Maria it's Jack, is Robin there? - Oh, Mr. Calhoun I'm sorry no she's not. - She on duty isn't she? - Well yes she is but she went out to breakfast. She was due back an hour ago. I don't know where she is. [dramatic music] - All right look we have to move a lot faster than we thought. Where's the money? [engaging music] - He's a rogue all right, he's moving on his own. - Staff do you have a word this is Federal six over. Did you authorize Calhoun to pick up the money and make the payment? - [Dispatcher] Negative on that. If he's moving stay with him. [engaging dramatic music] - Let's go. [tires screech] [cars slam] [engrossing music] [birds squawk] [phone rings] - Yeah. [Roger speaks in muffled tones] - What's your play Bantam? [Roger speaks in muffled tones] [intense action music] [boat revs] [bell tolls] [intense action music] [footsteps tap] [lights flicker on] - Don't move, mister. [dramatic music] - Robin, you all right? - Yes, so long as you promise to take me home. - I promise. I thought I told you to wait in the car. - You've told me a lot of things. - Cute, very cute, I'll tell you when to talk. - Okay, reach up, come on. Keep 'em up. [foreboding music] He's clean! [gun thuds] - Jack! - Hold it, we're coming down, come on babe. You'll be joining him soon enough, let's go, come on. Shut up! [Malone yells in agony] Come on! - Before you start killing anyone check the suitcases. [ominous music] That's right Jerry, go ahead, take a look. - He's messing with our minds, I'm gonna kill him. - Baby brother's overreacting Roger. You better explain it to him. You kill me you get nothing. - That's a valid point. - Thank you. - There is no money Rog, kill Calhoun and the broad now and then blow up the whole damn city. - Shut up I'm thinking! - Thinking about what, there is no money he's lying. - Calhoun, poor impulse control. - Shut up! - He's losing it Roger just like that half-witted ape you called Patty. - Shut your mouth Calhoun. - No, not until ya Roger your brother died in agony. I blew out his backbone. - You dirty rat. [fighting and grunting] [gun shot] [intense action music] [gun shots] - Get inside, do it! - Does that work? - It damn well it better, I paid $27.98 for it. - Oh God! [ominous music] [gun shot] - Jerry? Jerry? Answer me! [machine whirs] [gun shots] - Freeze you freaking maggot. Toss the gun, on your knees. Talk or die Bantam, where's the map? - It's in the black bag by the stairs. [dramatic music] - Wait for me outside, please. [foreboding music] [gun shot] [helicopter whirs] This is Calhoun, I have the map. You can send the bomb squads to the following locations: the 69th Street branch at Lexington, second stall in the ladies' room, the Harlem branch at 128th, assistant manager's office, behind the bar that looks like a computer terminal, Broadway, the 11th street branch, aha you're not gonna believe this one.
