You oughta try returning a telephone call now and then. Sorry about that. Am I interrupting anything? - No, no. I'm just getting ready to start work. No thanks. I can't stay. Just came by to see how you're doing, see you want to go to a Christmas party with me? - And? Come on man, give me a break. I transferred down here to Phoenix six months ago. I've seen you twice. - Yeah, and both times you couldnt help yourself but bring it up, so why dont you just get it over with. That's the trouble talking to controllers, you're always three moves ahead, you're working me like I'm traffic. That's what Ann used to say. Sorry about that. - Yeah me too. So how's the software business? - Just a bunch of ones and zeros, and zeros and ones. I still find it hard to believe that you'd rather work on an air traffic control computer game than call real traffic. - It pays real good and people seem to like it, and the kids think I'm really cool. All right here's the pitch damn it Jack I want you on my team I'm strapped. Murphy retired, he's gone. Robin's out on a pregnancy leave. McBain transferred to SoCal tracon. - I dont know what to tell you T. C. but I do not miss calling traffic. Hey look I am not asking for a career move here, just a couple of weeks, that's all.

Skyways 309, Phoenix center, turn left for 20 degrees for sequencing Maddog 45, Phoenix center, roger. - You still there? Louie I don't care what the union memo says. I need bodies here. Bryant, we got the latest weather! - Amanda I'll rotate you out first I promise. Louie what's it gonna be... Tell him if he can't get it here in an hour, forget it. Earl you're on. Hello. - Who are you? Look at this. - LA. is getting walloped. Is this gonna hit us tonight? - You tell me. Where's the golden girl? - Up in her office, kissing Senator Rutherford's butt. Hi, I'm Julie... -Julie Albrechl. I'm glad you're here. - Right. Senator it's such a pleasure to see you again. I promise we'll get you away as soon as we can. Gotta do better than that. I'm introducing the President live on all the networks. Well 5:30. I promise. It makes me proud that the system's best young facility chief is right here in my home town. I'm glad your here there's something here, want to show you. I've asked Washington for permission to create an incentive, a reward system for the troops. Say, if a controller goes five years without a phraseology error, we'll give him an FAA coffee mug. What do you think? - I think they'd love it. Okay, okay ail aircraft in my center, listen up, keep it moving and everything will be all right. I'm gonna tuck you in tight like a G-string. - Bryant, I'm sending you United 450, Hoss. Come on step up or we're gonna take you out back and shoot you. I got it smart guy. Center, SkyAtlantic 925, we are really getting bounced around here, can you give us a descent to two five zero. Nine two five, negative. Hold your altitude. Phoenix, we reaily need to get out of this now. - Negative traffic beneath you. Break out the barf bags bro. I don't see him on TCAS. I'm not going to risk it. Check your strips. Increase minimum separation to 20 miles. It's probably only a hiccup. Quinn? Quinn what's happening? Tell miss golden girl to back off. Or she can come down here and get on her hands and knees her own self. Right now look. I really need your cooperation now. So I'm gonna push your buttons, and you're gonna start. OK? Thank you. OK all right. Go to B sequence. United three-three-ihree contact K. C. center at one-one niner point nine five. United 333, Roger. - We're back on line. I want you to get plugged in.

Delta 285 maintain present attitude. - Delta 285 roger. They flip-flopped. It's the machine. - Take a break. - Take a break? Take 20. I need you back strong. - I can't work like this. Center, Delta 285, you haven't asked my heading in a couple of minutes. You still there? - Machines! Delta 285. Excuse us. A little early Happy New Year. No problem. I'm not going to report the blackout, it was a non-event. Let's just make sure it doesnt happen again, OK? Did you know that the only other tube like this in the entire world is owned by some retired NASA pencil jockey who lives in Huntsville Alabama. He keeps it above his fireplace. He calls it Tammy. I call this Bob. Now, you want a perfect operation, so do I. So all I need is some equipment, if you can find it, a budget. Bob. Hey old man. If you can tell me exactly how many turns to vector from here to Dunkin Donuts. I'll give you the whole box. I hate donuts. - Everybody likes donuts. Vector, south southwest to Maple street, south. OK this is where we stand. On top of our normal rotation, we're being asked to accept fifty more plus the entire Pacific Rim LAX evening cycle. Los Angeles is out too? WOKS off, zero visibility. Zero ceiling. I'll say it again, a crush like this would kill us on a sunny day in July, and if this storm hits us... Fifty-fifty. Right now the front has stalled about a hundred miles west of here. Good. Well than that's it. - You gonna take these additional flights? Why should we let Denver and Salt Lake have all the fun? Big guy. Excuse me. I have an important safety matter to discuss. Excuse me! I believe Randy Groves is still calling traffic. It wasn't his fault. - I'm filing on him. It was level 2, loss of separation. Page seven hundred and forty, appendix A. Any airspace conflict must be reported and investigated and the controller involved immediately removed. I'm filing on him. You wouldn't have one of these stuck up your ass, would you? You've reached Jack Harris at the sound of the tone please leave a message. Thank you. - Jack you there, pick up. Look Jack I need your help, you won't believe what this new Chief is shoving down my throat. I'm being selfish here, but I'm, well, I'm strapped. Come on Jack, just one night. What do you say hot shot. Come on, Jack, just one night. What do you say hot shot. Randy? There you are. Are you all right? - Yeah. - You good to go? - I'm okay. I'm cool. So, did you here what the golden girl's doing to us down there? Global 56 holding at the alley. Global 56 taxi to two six right via Delta to Charlie and hold by alley. I am so glad to be out of that dungeon. Tower we hit some road kill on Echo you might want to notify maintenance. Negative Captain we'll just call your catering service. Virgin 105 flow said it's another forty minutes of snooze before Chicago release. Might as well unbuckle. American twenty-three runway two-six left clear to land, winds two-niner-zero at eight knots. Altimeter two-niner-eight-seven. - American 23 runway two six left, roger. On your right. We're responsible for the airspace from Gentral Texas to the California border all the way to within five miles of the airport. This is sector 14 high you will be handling all IFR traffic above eighteen thousand feet. - Right. Now, you have four planes here that match these strips. There's their flight plans, squawk codes, hell you know all this. Right, just like at the academy. - Yeah, well, you look to be in good shape. Keep'em apart, no trouble. - All right don't worry about me. All right the backups are arriving I feel so much better. Don't you know who that is? - No. - That's right he left before you came. Global 56, turn right heading zero-eight-zero. 56, zero eight zero, roger. - I got a fifty spot that says he has a deai tonight. Now wait a minute, wait a minute. Just any kind of deal or separation lost. Southwest thirty climb and maintain flight level two-three-zero. Thirty's climbing. - It's not a fair bet. - Why? - It's 290 Harris. Just think I was going to call in sick tonight. Pacific twelve contact L. A. - No, no, no. - center one-two-four point six-five. Thank you Phoenix. - Thank you sir. - Hey, Hey. Center. American fifteen with you at one five thousand. Roger American fifteen maintain one five thousand, resume normal speed. How you doing T. C. - Hey good. I knew you were still alive in there somewhere. Roger UPS 19 heavy. Happy New Year to you too, sir. I'm ready and I'm here where do you want me? Right, well, you're not going to need that actually, I want you assisting on the printers. You want me running flight strips? - Sure man I'm there. You know I'm gonna help you get plugged back in, but... Sampson 750, Phoenix control descend and maintain one-one-thousand. Sampson, one one thousand. - Roger. - Look what we're dealing with. I understand, it's alt right. Yeah, I'll check with you later. I know let's get a drink or something. I don't drink. - A cup of tea, whatever. - I got it T. C. thanks. Cactus 68 advise when you get the numbers. Delta clear to roll winds two-five-five at eight. See you next time. - Hello, hello... - Virgin one oh five... Can anyone give me directions to the festival of lights in Tempe. What the hell was that? Bonanza niner echo. Traffic on a final two miles. Expedite your cross runway two-six right. - 2-6 right. Roger. - Skywest 4-7-8. Hello! - Did you hear that? - Hear what? Skywest four-seven-eighi captain we're still waiting for word from flow on D. C. and Baltimore, will advise. Hello! Phoenix tower. This is Dr. Shamaal Makurgee, M. D., I am a licensed pilot, FAA. Are you there? Because I'm here. Tower? Tower repeat. This is Dr. Shamaal Makurgee M. D. licensed pilot. To the unidentified pilot on frequency one two six point seven. Contact Phoenix tower at one two zero point seven immediately. Air Mexico 183 Phoenix maintain two-seven-zero knots. Sequence for a buck? - How much time do I get? American 87, Phoenix turn left ten degrees direct Santa Fe VOR'. I'll give you five seconds. - Shoot. - A 15, R30, C60. T105. Next two. E150. - Wrong, E 165. You're slipping man. I'm worried about my controllers. - Your controllers will be fine. They're among the most highly trained people working for the federal government. I got wind at eighty knots below three thousand feet and zero visibility headed straight for us. - Wrong. The storm stalled. Even so I already have to fly forty-eight planes through a crack of smooth air tighter than your budget. We cannot handle the additional flights. If Denver can do it. We can do it. Damn it Susan this is about the committee review. This is about you and your facility rating. Well this is not Chicago approach Susan. This is not New York. Now I know why you stepped down from Chicago. You couldnt handle it, could yeah? Hey, where's my damn strips? I put them in order of altitude. Phoenix, Southwest five five six. Did you say three five zero? Hey, hey, rookie, rookie? What? - Hi, hi, sorry to bother you. What are these jets doing in my sector? - I dont know. Get them out of my air now, NOW! - Phoenix, TWA 44, how about two four zero? TWA 44,1, I can't approve that right now. Can you hold on a minute? God I know how to do this. All right, all right, all right, all right. Okay. United I mean TWA. - TWA 44, Phoenix fly to two-niner-zero. TWA 44, heading two-niner-zero, roger. Southwest 556, expedite climb maintain flight level two-seven-zero. Reduce to two-five zero-knots. - Southwest 556, climbing to two-seven-zero at two-five-zero knots. Why so slow? Southwest 556, we got to untie a knot here, but we will get you back to speed, and I promise a smooth tailwind across Kansas. Is there a tailwind? - I don't know, but pilots love to hear it. I'm sorry I should have introduced myself sooner. I'm Julie Albrecht. - Jack Harris. Can I give you a tip? - Please. Pilots are kind of like dogs, you can tell what you want them to do, but if they hear fear in your voice. They're gonna start to take things into their own hands. So no matter how crazy it gets on there, you keep your voice strong. Right, right, right. I'm sorry i just got distracted. If you want to get a pilot to do something, the magic word is expedite. Expedite your climb immediately. - Expedite. Now take a deep breath. Your major concern is right here. You can lose separation in a couple minutes. All you got to do is turn him, slow him down and tuck this one in right behind him. Left? - No, turn him first. One-eight-zero, and you better slow him down to three hundred. American 101, turn right heading 1-8-0, reduce to two-five-zero knots. American 101, 2-5-0. - See one of the hardest things to grasp is that your dealing with a two dimensional image, but your actually dealing with three dimensions. Altitude, direction, and speed. Which means time. Plus you have to stay a couple steps ahead of these guys. Look right here. Your gonna have a terrible tangle here in about 5 minutes, but once you realize that. That's 95 percent of the battle. - Where? Now, who over's working sector 25 high kind of screw's yeah, by sending this parade in all messed up like this, but we'll get them lined up in no time. I see it. - Altitude, direction and speed. So, we'll turn United first? No, he's the closest but he's coming In the slowest. All right. Southwest 60 turn left heading zero-niner-five. Break. Continental 923, turn right heading two-seven zero. Break. PhoenixAir 394, reduce two-five-zero knots for traffic overtaking your 12 o'clock, seven miles. - Everything all right over here? Yeah, we just untied a knot. - Take your break. Thank you. Well? - She ran into a jam. You want to slay with this sector? I think I can swing it. - Center. Vanguard 939 with you at xray. - Roger Vanguard, 939. I'll plug in right now if you want to go back to the strips. No, I'd like to stay. - I thought you might. Thanks. Vanguard 939 welcome to my airspace. We'll try to give you some smooth air tonight. - Good evening Phoenix. It's good to be with you. - Good evening to you sir. Get me Mister... - If this is about Randy, I told you... Do I need to get my eyes checked, or does Julie Albreckt need a shave? Who is that on fourteen high? Do you ever go home? It's Jack Harris. - Flight two ninety Harris? Where's his paperwork? - I know, Murray, it's my fault, you'll get it. I won't sign them. This man could be a threat to airspace safety. That is my single concern, item one... I was there the night of the crash. - No one is questioning his quote, heroism, unquote. I'm referring when he transferred to Phoenix and tried to return to work... Murray, do you understand what we're dealing with here tonight? March 1994. Subject arrived intoxicated at work. He complete alcohol rehab program. - July 1995. Subject verbally abused co-workers, had to be restrained. And the complaint was dropped. Look, I know how it may look on paper, but I've known Jack Harris for ten years, he's the best controller I've ever seen. November 1996. After a level two loss of separation, subject physically assaulted facility chief. And got a standing ovation. I need him. He's stayin'. I'm taking this up with the regional inspector general. You know what that could mean for you. I've seen your file too, Murray. Did you know, that in the entire history of the F.A. you're only one of three controllers ever to volunteer for that job? Phoenix Approach at one two seven point five five Point five five, good evening. Have a good evening loo, sir. - Just like riding a bicycle? Okay, are you ready for your field certification test? - Sure. Why not. All right. What's our control airspace? - Fifty mile radius, hand off to tower at five miles, all V. F. R and l. F. R. at 2000 feet. And our runway configuration? - Roger tower. Delta thirty nine, we need you to slow down your approach due to ground traffic. Reduce to one four zero knots. Runway configuration? - Delta thirty nine, roger. Twin east west, both seven thousand feet, rated level one, all weather. Standard localizer and glide slope secondary north and south at sixty two hundred feet. Field elevation? - Two niner eight seven above sea level. And our handoffs outbound? - West, Los Angeles sector thirty nine at frequency one five eight point seven, east El Paso one three five point five, and north Kansas City one two niner point eight. Right-O. I should've thrown this away a long time ago, but I didnt. Jezus christ. - Welcome back, hot shot. Thanks. Mercury four seven seven, we need you to turn right, heading one zero zero. Mercury four seven seven, we're turning, good evening to you Phoenix. You have a good evening too, sir. The guy's not here, he's got one foot at the console, and he's got one foot in the sky. I've heard enough on this guy. - Shut up! I'm telling you, the guy's a spook. Who you calling a spook? - Your buddy, two ninety Harris. - At least he's a body. We need all the help we can get. - That's right. But this is not the place and tonight's not the night to rehabilitate a career. We've studied the crash of two ninety. I mean, you've heard the tapes. There's nothing you, me or anyone else could have done. - Yeah, yeah... It wasn't Harris's fault! - You're entirely missing the point. Forget the crash. Look in his eyes. Where is he? A good controller never thinks that those are people up there. He never minks that lives are at stake. - Yeah, right, you're so full of shit, of course it's about people... - You want to end up like Harris? You wanna be a drunk? Or like, what's the... - The white guy, Wilkins, from Miami... You're such a racist. - This guy hangs himself with his own belt... Should've called in sick. - Let me tell you something. You know where I'm going? To Chicago. And I'm going to pull in the big money. You wanna know how? Okay. You've got a sky full of jets. You get bad weather... - A night like tonight. - And you handle it. Period. If you think that those jets are full of people, you're going to choke. They're not. They're time space and speed problems. They're blips to be processed, controlled and ordered. That's it. Human lives have nothing tb do with it. - Amanda? How long you been off? I know! - Why dont you do something? Dont you work here? - Bite me. So have you checked out the twin turbos on the new Cessna by any chance? Yeah. She's kinda sexy. Flight sixty nine, you are now cleared for takeoff. Excuse me. - Make sure your tray tables are in the upright position. How you doing? I'm Cruise by the way. I just wanted to... I'm sorry about before, I should you gotta keep your ducks in a row. A little light reading. Right. Hey, if you've any questions about this stuff, if you've any... if you need, need help at all, you can come to me, okay? Thanks. I'll keep that in mind. - Okay. You know. Because it's tricky... you know... there's some... night takeoffs, you know. Horizontal separations... The crank in the A. C. in here is just amazing. So. yeah. CM. eighty flight manual. This is great. Have you checked out the chapter on deicing, by any chance? - Yeah. It comes right after the chapter on failed approaches. I think. Yeah. That went surprising well. You know, like in a first date kind of way, I think. Yeah. Pacific four seven seven, contact Kansas City center at two niner point eight. You have a good evening loo, sir. Twin Cessna four two five go. Clear to Santa Barbara, V. A. after Blythe. Direct maintain flight level two zero zero. - Takeout? Appetizers are great, they're only five bucks. - Thanks. - Let me know. Center, United three eight three, climbing to three zero zero.

You picked a hell of a night to come back, Harris. You know, ya... you're were going to be my hero. How's that? - Well. You were out. You had it made. Life after controlling. Look at me. A total mess. You had a deal tonight, didn't yeah. It wasn't my fault. Systems error. I used to really love this. I was really good, too. So easy.

No, I understand, we'll do our best. I want to thank you again. - No problem. Can I bum a cigarette? - Sure, yes. Can I ask you a couple questions? - Sure. Tonight's so intense for me, I, feel like I barely know what I'm doing, you know? I wasn't scheduled to plug in for another couple of weeks. You must have quit? - Yeah. I got a pretty nice opportunity with a computer software firm, so 1 moved aver... I meant quit smoking. Yeah. I quit a few months ago. I dont think I'm going to quit anytime soon. I just had no idea how, how different calling traffic would be compared to the simulators. It's just... You can't really fail this test. Yeah, but the pilots, they talk so fast, and the radio cuts off calls, and the screens constantly moving, and just walking into that room it's just such a rush, you know. Probably not for you, though, it's just... routine, right? So, how, how long have you been controlling? - About eight years. An instructor at, at Oklahoma City, he would compare controllers to athletes, like baseball players. He would say, don't think about hitting the ball, just hit the ball, you know. And then he just go on... Are you okay? I'm sorry, I just, you don't look too good. I'm fine. - I'm not. I'm wired, I'm sorry, I'm talking a mile a minute, and... Is, is it still exciting for you, is, is it still a challenge? You know, I remember the first night I plugged in. First night on the boards. You're right. It's a great job. There's no other job like it on earth. It's kinda like your instructor said. The one thing you got to remember about sports, the hardest thing to do is hit a fastball. True. But you still love it, though, right? Yeah. I still love it. You're doing great tonight. - Thanks. Contact Phoenix approach at one two six point four seven. Good day, sir. - I really appreciate you staying. Never again. You owe me for this. Phoenix center, these holding delays are bullshit. Who said that? - Attention ail flights in this sector, who said that? Who said that word? - American four eighty four, negative on the bullshit. T. W. A, nine thirty three, negative on the bullshit. Continental sixty four, negative on the bullshit. Delta two eighty two, negative on the bullshit. Texas seventy seven, negative on the bullshit, I want you to set up for both approach sectors. - You got it, Hoss. East west approach channels, nice and clean, hand them off to Randy. You got it. - I'm serious. We've got a snarly bitch bear coming. Cake. Southwest four twelve, contact Kansas City, one three five point six five. Roger, Phoenix. Happy new year. - Roger Southwest, same to you. Northwest twenty nine, El Paso altimeter two niner zero four. I'll do anything I can to help. - Except clean the restrooms. Strips. You got it. - Thanks. Repeat Northwest twenty nine, El Paso altimeter two niner zero four. God damn it. - Where's Phoenix? Listen up Phoenix, you there? All right people. Sit tight. Wait for the emergency lights. Can I take my break now? - I have no idea. I think the power company lost a terminal somewhere. Curtis. - Not so close. Listen. Reboot the system, okay? No, come back here. All right, listen. Once you get the juice, you come back here and tell me why those batteries gave out again, okay? Quinn! - As soon as I know the rules, you're going to love this game. Okay, come on, watch your step. Phoenix, we're just going to fly right on in as fast as we want, do you read? Phoenix? That's it. - Quinn! You are killing us up here! You okay? - Yeah. This. Kennedy is sending troops to someplace called South Vietnam. Are you holding your breath? Well. We're partially back. What do you mean? - It means that we don't have enough juice, so either it's your computers or the cooling system. You can't have a cool center and have your computers work at the same time. How long can we run without A. C. I'd say, as soon as it reaches a hundred and 5 down here, the computers will crash. Susie? Don't use all your lights. To all flights holding for Phoenix arrival, listen up and pay attention, ladies and gentlemen, or something's going to happen none of us wants to see. We're sending you into twin lanes for slam dunks as fast as we can. Phoenix has suspended departures, so ground traffic will be minimal. You flights on the northeast ring, pass out more peanuts, you're the cabooses. Center, Silver Air four nine four, you're gonna ruin our on-time record. Silver Air four nine four, negative sir, please hold your present speed. Hey, for the record, you were right. I called national flow and tried to get 'em to. The jets are coming, we're going to land them. Who's last in? - Transgulf forty seven, regular run from Dallas. Miss? Can I get another Jack Daniels, please. Yes sir, you can. - I'm sorry. America West forty six. Descend and maintain one four thousand. One four thousand, roger. - So, is it true what they say about controllers, burning out by their mid-thirties? That's what they say. So why are you back? I'm not back. Bryant needed some help tonight, so I'm here. I've lost radio. Compile a iist of flights and fuel levels. We gotta turn them away. You're right, thanks. Cruise, alert L. A. Central, Randy, call Kansas City. - Okay. Amanda. - Yeah? - See if you can get a hold of the duty officer at the Air Force base, see if their tower can be of any help. Yes, I need central air operations for all the major airlines. All sectors, flight strips down here a-sap. Fuel estimates. Julie! - Sir. Take down these numbers. F. L two nine seven two, sixty five hundred pounds. Alpha juliet five six seven three, seventy nine hundred pounds. Sector thirteen, I need your strips now. All inbound aircraft. Bryant, Palmdale has radio contact but no radar. Can they take thern? - Negative. - Well, the nearest all weather runway is Los Vegas. How many can make it? - No! Los Vegas is out. They got severe winds, heavy rains and zero visibility. Denver is nearest. - Let's see... These flights have got enough fuel to make it, maybe Delta 41, but I wouldn't risk it. All right, Cruise? Get on the horn to Paimdaie and tell them to send the following jets to Denver. U. S. Air eighty eight, Southwest four thirty eight, United twenty one, Continental eight thirty eight, T.W.A. forty four, Texas four ninety three, Cactus twenty one. What about the rest? - Well, I dont know. There's McClain Municipal, there's the National Guard strip near Sonoma, and the Air Force Base. - Well, the longest runway of the three of them is sbc thousand feet, Sonoma doesnt even have emergency crews. Well if Quinn doesnt get us back on line, we don't have a choice. Shit. Come on, clear the desk. Okay. This is our runway, here are our thunder storm cells right here. Okay. Now. All the gum pieces are our aircraft above fifteen thousand feet, and the batteries represent aircraft on in-bound marker under ten thousand. Quinn. The radio first. I know. Five seconds. Okay. Northwest three nine three will be right there. Man, I hate those air traffic controllers, I mean, what do they really do, just sit there. Who needs them? - What's FAA. stand for? Fucked again and again. Damn... Work. Now. - Nope. Now. - Not yet. Come on. - Where are you going? Isn't funny? This thing was on my requisition form about six months ago. I'm going to the hardware store. You wanna come? - Can you fix it? I need to make a decision. - Susan, I'll know in twenty minutes. Fifteen. - Why do you always say that? Your attention please. Will passenger Madison Persell please pick up the nearest white courtesy telephone. No. Unacceptable. I'm going to direct dialog the Senator and bylink conference you in two. Sir, I just learned that Duiles and National are open, but the White House wants to replace you with the Speaker of the House. They don't think you can make It in time. It's going to be a P. R. catastrophe. Christina, here is another reason why you should've attended West Point. You've obviously failed to master Command and Control in a crisis situation. I'm cool. - Phoenix... Nort...Three nine... do you copy. Center. Are you there? - Yes! We have radio. Northwest three nine three, roger, sorry we left you. Maintain flight level three five zero... This is not a problem. It's not a problem, just watch. We split 'em into odds and evens, right, these northern flights become the odds, they descend to seven, evens descend to six, odds bend back, fold into one line, five miles in-trail. Yeah, but I dont see. - Just stay with me, hang with me, please. This can work. The odds bend like an S, right, slows them down, back behind the parade, and in. The final approach will be like a slam dunk, but... Why waste time with this square dance thing. We'll just have them hold and circle and we'll just peal them off one by one. Because there's not enough fuel. Phoenix, Northwest three nine three heavy. Requesting clearance for direct to the airport. Northwest three ninety three, turn right heading two seven zero. Intercept two six left localizer, maintain seven thousand and expect I. L. S. approach. Roger. - Randy. Here comes number one. I'm ready. - What about the backup? Negative again. We've lost the i. L. S. Where did they go? - All sectors hold all arrivals. Phoenix, Northwest three niner three heavy. We've got a major problem holding. - Northwest three ninety three. Remain in holding. We are aware of your fuel situation. You will receive vectors to the Air National Guard base if necessary. Well, it's all lit up. So what does that say to you? It says to me every system is working. Quinn, we only have eight minutes. - We only have eight minutes. That's it Come on, let's go. Phoenix, we have approximately seven minutes until we declare a fuel emergency. Unbelievable. I hope you can see this, Stratton, you... I can read your lips, Quinn. Sorry, but the golden girl never climbs the stairs. Unbelievable. It's dead. - No kidding. All right, talk to me. - We're at the dish. And we still don't have it. - They still ain't got it. Now or Never... Phoenix, Northwest three niner three heavy. Give us the vectors to the Air Force Base. He did it! - Clear the sky! Northwest three ninety three, you are cleared out of holding. Descend to four thousand, expect I. L. S. approach, runway two six romeo, break. U. S. Air forty five, turn left... - You need help? - heading zero five zero, vectors to the approach course, descend to six thousand, you are two out of five, break. United three twenty five, turn right heading two seven zero, you will be following traffic three miles at your nine o'clock. Where's Stratton. I've been sitting on a hard plastic seat drinking bad coffee for three hours... Sir, only authorized personnel are allowed in this area... I was suppose to be in the air at five thirty, It is now seven thirty... Excuse me, sir. Could you please step outside. - You dont tell me to step outside. I can have all your asses on a platter. To whoever can hear my voice, this is Doctor Shamaal Mukurgee, M. D., Licensed Pilot. I believe it would be prudent for me to land the plane now. However, unfortunately... I still cannot see the ground. - If you have a transponder, turn it on so we can see you on radar. Do you understand. - Transponder? No. - Where the hell did this come from? That's it... Take it easy, Randy, That's it! No more taking it easy! And you just stay away from me! Everyone just stay away from me. Now Stratton, I know for a fact that the Washington airports are open, so what am I going to tell the President about what happened here tonight? Move, move, move, move it! Aircraft sierra... Sir, we're having a very difficult evening, if you'd care to discuss it, we can step outside... Not until you tell me when I will be in the air! Go to the tower and jump. I'll clear that flight. Sir. You are disrupting a very delicate operation. I am not leaving until you answer my question. I am asking you to please leave my facility. When you release my flight. - I can't hear! Leave, or I have you arrested for trespassing. I thought you were one of our up and comers, Stratton. I tried to turn them. - Well, they're heading straight for each other, try again. Flight five sixty, turn left and descend immediately. Break. Flight thirty four, turn right and climb immediately. No response. - Did you try helping them... - No! Thank you! No! - Easy man! Just get this guy away from me. - That's okay. It's okay. - Jezus. Holy shit, where'd he come from? Mom, mom! I saw an airplane out there! Twenty years of calling traffic, I've never seen anything like that. Forget about it, pilot error. You all right? Yeah, I've got these thunder storm cells right here, we've just got east west left. Can you do it? - Hey... it's me. It's going to be pretty tight. Is there enough fuel to restage? Watch and learn, Hoss. I call this the Mary Lou Retton flip. I know you're going to pull me. - You should've been long gone. No. it wasnt my fault. And you're not going to report me... because it was the machine. You're making it worse. - Who investigates the machine? I'm going to add a psych evaluation, you're looking at 120 days. No. Who monitors the system? What are you gonna do with that? - Where are the tapes? - Give me that thing! Where are the tapes! No investigation and no report! No investigation and no report! No investigation and no report! No! No! No, no, no, no. - Calm, Calm. Forgive me for saying... I told you so. Murray, go home. - Let go of the golf club. Help him out of here. - I'm okay. - Come on. - I'm okay. Come on. Do you smoke? - No. - Neither do I. Mary Lou Retton. Next time I'll show you my Michael Jordan slam. No thanks Hoss. - No thanks. I suppose a blow job is out of the question. All right people, we're out of the woods. Terrific job. Well done. Well, it was nice working with you. - Thanks. Good luck working here. - You did great tonight. That was fun. - Yeah. And we get to do it all over again tomorrow. Hey sweetie. Mommie's coming home. All right. Bye. Hey everybody. Hold up. A toast. New Years! - Got any big plans for the new year? No. Not really. Join us? - No alcohol in the facility. Got yeah! Here we go. - Hey Sam. How many you drop today? Five. That's low for you. - I'd like to propose a toast. To hell with Chicago. To hell with New York. You are the best controllers in the world. - Hear hear. Beautiful sight. You guys hungry? You want anything before I unplug Mr. Gourmet? No thanks, Connie Nothing personal, Connie, but, your coffee's got more octane than the fuel in this plane. I take that as a no. Ladies and gentlemen, the captain has turned on the fasten seatbelt sign. If you would please make sure your seatbacks and tray tables are in the full upright and locked positions for our descent into Phoenix. Thank you. - I still can't believe that game. The Chiefs as a team has one purpose. To burn me out. Think you got problems? The damn Dodgers haven't won since eighty eight. Hey, pal, let me suffer here. I mean, they had homefield advantage in Arrowhead. Fuses are fried. Hello. No avionics. And no radio. There goes the blood supply. Switching to backup. Negative. - The pump. Negative. - Once again. Contact center. Use your cell phone. Goodnight, everyone. - 'Night, 'Mande. Radar room. - Phoenix. Transgulf forty seven. We've lost radio. - I'll patch you through to your controller. Cruise. It's for you. Transgulf forty seven, go ahead. - Roger Phoenix, we've totally lost hydraulics and avionics. No rudders. No flaps. No way to turn. We're flying blind. We'd be hard pressed to make the runway. Transgulf forty seven. How much fuel, how many souls on board? We have sufficient fuel, we'll have to get back to you on the count. I understand. - The weather's deteriorating rapidly. Roger. Contacting E. T. C. for advice please stand by. Roger Phoenix... we're not going anywhere. Bryant. We've got a situation. The E. T. C. has no advice. They can't believe it's still flying. Initiate phase one emergency crash response. Put 'em on the speaker. Transgulf forty seven. We have no further advice at this time. Roger Phoenix, Just keep us away from the city. We got about forty seconds to decide of we want them to ditch in the desert. Any alternative? - Well, after that its suburbs then downtown. Right. So we slow them down right here... - Without hydraulics, how do they get down. Gravity. Just reduce power, glide in and drop. There's got to be a freeway, or some roads. - Yeah, there are four access roads in this five square mile area... - At night, in no visibility, in a storm? I know, it's sheer luck, but its his only chance. Look. This plane is going down. The only decision we have to make is where. The desert. It'll produce the most survivors. Forty seven. Reduce speed as much as practical. Roger Phoenix we understand. Wait. There's another way. By alternating thrust we can give them a no-gyro approach. Susan! We have another option. Tell her. When I was in the Navy controlling, we had a Tomcat lose all hydraulics. We regained directional control by alternating the thrust on the left and right sides. Try it. - But what's the point? What am I suppose to tell him? Tell him we can get him to turn by reducing power in one engine. You and I, we time the turn, lets say thirty seconds, one degree per second, then we can calculate. - Call it. Well what's the point. Even if we can turn him, we're are we going to send him? He's got no hydraulics, no glide slope, no localizer. We'll be his eyes... - Call it. Transgulf forty seven, we recommend turning by alternating thrust. We'll try to establish a consistent turn rate and help you calculate a no-gyro approach. We understand. Three... two... one... It didn't work. - Come on. There's a ten second delay on the radar. He turned. Twenty three degrees. - All right. Now, where. Hold on, I think I got something. South by southeast, towards the border. Away from those storms. It's low, it's flat, low population. What about medical response. It can't be too isolated. Transgulf forty seven. We're trying to figure out our next move. Do you have any preferences? - Someplace fiat and hard. Roger forty seven. - Okay, there's an Army base here. They can help with search and rescue. Straight roads here, and here, it's worth a shot. - Your call... What does he need to do to head two seven zero. In this plane, at his current speed, I'd have to do a couple of test turns, but I'm sure I can get him going in the right direction. Fuel? - Twelve minutes at current speed. Do it. Find out who's in charge at the base and get him on the line. Wait a second. I think we can get him back to the airport. What? - No. A series of left hand turns at a controlled rate of descent... He burns his fuel, drops under the ceiling, and heads right to the city... - No. We get him near the airport. We drop him low, treetop level, bring him in under the clouds... - And if you're wrong, he's right over the city. You're sending a 737 skidding into a storm with no visuals, no hydraulics and no glide slope... I don't have time for this. Talk to me. A series of left hand turns in a controlled rate of descent in a tightening spiral brings 'em right into our runway. - With a lot of lives in the equation. I understand that. Bryant? - With his fuel we've got to get it right the first time, if we're off a degree... - No. We brought the Tomcat back to the Kitty Hawk in thirty foot swells, and I got to tell you our runways is a hell of a lot bigger than an aircraft carrier. Look. This might not be exactly how it happens, but we can talk him down. Phoenix, this is Transgulf forty seven. We, alt, are waiting to hear from you. - Transgulf forty seven, please stand by. Cruise, you call it, Harris, you assist him with the numbers. Bryant, alert all emergency ground support. Its all right. I'm sorry, this is not going to work. - No, it's okay, I can hold them. Ma'am. I can't let you keep both of them. - No Please we're not going to crash anyway. Ma'am, you cannot hold both of them, let me take one... - Ma'am. Let me help. I can take one. - Thank you. It's all right. All right. I got him. All available rescue units, were shooting for runway two six left. 8. T. A. ten minutes. Transguif, this is Phoenix control. Your flight forty seven has lost hydraulics and avionics. They are now communicating by cellular phone. We have a fifteen second right engine bum in twenty five seconds Right. - Shit. - It's just a hiccup, it's just a hiccup. Come on, come on, Come ON. - Fifteen second burn, ten seconds. Wait a minute, that's too far, it'll put 'em at one eight zero. - Fifteen second... They need to do a twenty three degree turn... - Five...four... ...if we divert them that long they'll end up in Mexico Phoenix. Repeat. - Shit. Fix it. Okay, we can compensate with a fifty five second bum in thirty seconds. Look man, you've got to calm down... - All I want to hear from you is the numbers. Okay? Try it now Almost. Phoenix the ailerons are back. What's our next move? Forty seven, we are working on it, maintain heading. Come on, come on, come on. - Fifteen second burn, in ten seconds. Forty seven, on my mark, fifty second burn, right thruster... No, no, fifteen second! No, correction forty seven... - No, wait, wait, slow... slow down. Say again? - Calm down. Remember, you're talking to a man up there. Forty seven. On my mark, fifteen second burn, right thrust to one four zero. Now. And stop. - Level out. Got it, Phoenix. - What's next? Maintain heading for seventy five seconds. - Maintain heading for one minute fifteen. Good work! - Don't tell me how to talk to pilots! I've never lost a plane. I have a perfect record! - Cruise. Step away. What? - Harris, you call it. Bryant? - Take a break. Now. Knock yourself out. You ready, Jack? Let's do it. Transgulf forty seven, sorry for the delay, bear with us and we will get you down. Ten seconds. Stop the bird in five... four... three... two... one. Stop. Transgulf forty seven... maintain heading for thirty seconds. Radio's back. - Good work. There are one hundred and thirty eight souls on board. Phoenix, our radios are back... and including crew we have a hundred and thirty eight souls on board. Chicago center, two niner zero. We got that information for you now. Including crew, we have one hundred and seventy four souls on board. Phoenix. - Do you copy? One hundred and thirty eight souls. Center, we have a situation, we have flames on engine number two. We've leveled off. Chicago center, two niner zero, over. I have a collision alert. I repeat. We've leveled off. Phoenix control. This is Transgulf Forty seven. No. Forty seven. We are calculating your last turn. It's going to be a long slow sixty second burn. Bring you right into runway two six. It's seven thousand feet long, open fields beyond. Even without flaps, you will be smiling. Ready. On your mark. Copy. Five... four... three... two... one. Burn. Steve. Steve, Will you handle that! Transguif forty seven, come in. Transgulf forty seven, come in. We've lost positive radar contact. Tower, do you have him? Negative. Nothing. Transgulf forty seven, come in. I'm going to call it. - No! Don't you call it. The calculations were right. His coordinates were correct. Transgulf forty seven, come in. Damn it. Transgulf forty seven, come in. God damn it, they were right, god damn it! County rescue, this is Stratton, Phoenix Air Traffic Control Center, we've had a crash. Those of you with tomorrow off, the NTSB accident investigators Will be here, and so will you. Bryant? You'd better get up here, Harris just ran by my door. Jack? - The coordinates were right! That's right. - My calculations were correct! I know they were. - A series of left hand turns in a tightening spiral brings them right into this god damned runway! Jack. Come on in now. - No! Jack. Come on in... Listen. You did all you can do, now come on in. - Wait a second, do you hear that? It's coming from over there! He's right. - Shit! I've got positive radar contact, five miles out, heading two six zero at one five five knots. Phoenix, Transgulf forty seven, we, had a little electrical problem. Hope we didn't scare you. - Transgulf forty seven, no scare here. You should be approaching the outer marker. - We got it. Phoenix, can you confirm our wheels are down? - Looks good from here. Transgulf forty seven, you are too far left. Transgulf forty seven, you're going to have to come around again. Its okay. No! - Transgulf forty seven, power up. More power. Jezus christ! Transgulf forty seven, you are looking good. Hey Phoenix. - What's your name? Harris. - What's yours? - David Donnelley. Let me buy you a cold one. - David. be buying the cold ones. You're doing all the work up there... David? - Yeah Harris. You see the runway yet? - No. Not anymore. Okay. Your last turn is going to be approximately twenty seconds, on my mark. Correction, your last turn will be exactly-twenty two seconds, on my mark. Three, two...one. Mark. Right engine thrust. Too far left. He's right. Shit. David. Can you come around again? I can't do that. We are committed. I can do this. He's moving over to runway one eight. - Laura. Clear that runway. You got it, Bryant. - Come on, hold on. David, more power. YEAH! Outstanding! Outstanding! David, welcome to Phoenix. Welcome to Phoenix. Hey Harris. That Tomcat missed the canter, didn't it? Yeah. But we saved the crew. Hey, Cruise. You know, my wife's here to pick me up. If you ever tell her what we've just went through... you'll never fly with me again. Our secret. Feels good to hit a fastball, doesn't it? Yeah. #DEDICATED TO TEH THOUSANDS OF AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND PILOTS WHO KEEP US SAFE.#
