They're gonna find you, man. You're making a big mistake. You don't know whose money you're taking. - Sure I do. Mine. (gun firing) (brakes screeching) (clinking) You're gonna hold on to my money. You're gonna keep it safe. You keep your fucking head down. You got it? - Okay. - Good boy. Let's go.

And you know that I know that this is all a result of you fucking me. So let me tell you what I'm fitting to do. I wanna let you keep all that you have acquired, secretly acquired, and I'll just walk away. How you like that? - Are you going to kill me? - Yeah. You're gonna leave now. - Greg, I'll walk you out. (dance music) - [Man] Hey girl, you know I got you. - What the fuck? I didn't know you had to pay, all right? It said it was an open bar! - Well it's fucking closed to you now so why don't you get the hell out of here? - I got friends in there! Oh, come on, guys. - Hey. (banging) - I'll toss y'all a couple bucks if that's all you want. Motherfuckers. (lighter clinking) What are you doing here? - Hey Chance. Boo. - Do you want a beer or something? - Nah, kid, I'm good. - You mind if I grab one? - Sure. Knock yourself out. Where's my money, Chance? - It's up there. (phone buzzing) - Just a phone. - A fucking phone? Do I look like I need a fucking phone, boy? I want my money. - I swear. It was up there right where I left it. Oh no, no, no, no. - I'm sorry, kid. (bashing) (groaning) - No. (whimpering) No! (bashing) (somber music) Look, I'll get you the fucking money, okay? - There should be no getting the money, Chance. You should have it. And you don't fucking have it. (bashing) - Ah, dammit. I'll get you the money, promise. - Where the fuck is a kid like you gonna get that type of cash? (bashing) - Listen. You know, you're a stupid kid, Chance. That liquor in your belly, that's your only friend. - Wait. You don't have to. - Shh. (gun firing) - You think he could have found it? - Who gives a fuck? Let's go! (gun firing) (cases clinking) - Boss. - Yeah. What kind of news you got for me? - Well I think I found you a new supplier. Can you meet with her tonight? - I got to clean up my house after that neighbor's child came and dirtied it up and then, how about if I could meet with her tomorrow? - I'll arrange that for you. - Cool. - All right. - All right. (gun firing) ¶ Hell hand, got a hold on the brush ¶ ¶ I'm a natural born caresser ¶ ¶ I might fuck home stretch ¶ ¶ I might make a little money ¶ ¶ Leave a little on the dresser ¶ ¶ And they say I'm an adult ¶ - [Man] Back at you, boss man. - [Man] You got it? - [Man] Let me get it straight. - [Man] Yeah let's do it, you got the stuff. - Catch you tonight, dogs. Gotta do this business and all that. Yeah. What's going on boss, what you need? - Some suits. - I got swingers, what you need? (tense music) (bashing) - Stop, motherfucker! On your knees! You have the right to remain silent. (phone ringing) Detective Munce. (radio chatter) Who wanted you dead, kid? (light gloomy music) (coughing) (car revving in distance) (tense music) - Swilley. - Frank. This guy says he's been looking for you. He's from the city. - Mr. Wilson, I'm Detective Munce. You're not an easy man to find, Mr. Wilson. - Sometimes when you can't find a man, it's 'cause he don't wanna be found. You here to arrest me? - I'm not here to arrest you. I'm afraid the news I have is much worse than that. So you used to be a cop? I've heard stories. Real badass whip got the job done. (phone ringing) - [Man] Boss, that kid Chance, he didn't come into work last night. - [Munce] Is that him? - Yeah. - I'm sorry. No parent should ever outlive their child. - How did it happen? - Well they beat him pretty good. Then shot him execution style. - Who? - We don't have any leads yet. But I'm all over it. - Dear Lord, we offer this prayer today on behalf of our loved one, Chance Wilson. Carry him into your kingdom with you. We ask this in Lord Jesus Christ's name. Amen. - God dammit. (sighs) Frank, I truly am sorry. - You know, I must, must have thought a hundred times what I could have done different. Make it so he didn't leave the swamp. - Nah. He was as strong-willed as his daddy. Wasn't ever gonna stop him. - Excuse me a sec. Knew my son Chance? - Not long enough. I'm the one who found him. - Frank. Wilson. I'm Chance's dad. - Charlotte. I'm sorry, I just-- - It's all right. How'd you know my son? - I work at a casino. - Name of the casino? - It doesn't have a name. - No name, really? Chance play cards there? - Only when he wasn't sleeping. Playing poker was like his job. - [Frank] I haven't talked to my son Chance in years. - [Charlotte] I know. - Thank you for coming. (phone ringing) - Hello. - I found the kid. I'm at his apartment complex right now. Did some digging, he was killed the other night. - What a shame. Look under every rock. Do everything you have to do to find out who did this to that boy. I'ma head over to this charity now. What a shame. (tense music) (clacking) (ominous music) (dog barking) - What you gonna do? - I need to borrow your truck. (snorting) - You know, if Molly Ann was still alive you wouldn't be doing this. - Yeah, I know. But you know them city cops, huh, Swill. They don't give two shits about us. - How long has it been since you shot a man, Frank? - Been a minute. - Well that's a duffel bag full of guns you got there. What's that for? - You could call them negotiation tactics. - Shit. - Yeah. (car starting) (tense music) (car honking) - Boss, this is Karina, the new supplier I mentioned. - Listen. We just got rid of a lifelong supplier. And well, I heard a lot of nice things about your family. - My family has been in business for a while. I think you should try us. - Well, volume, how about volume? You got a lot of product? - You know what you want. - All right, babe. - Listen. We're gonna have to talk about Desmond. - My son, again. - Yeah. (light music) (ominous music) - Hey. Can I top you off? - [Frank] Yeah. (door chime ringing) - [Woman] Frank? Jesus, you look different. - And by different, you mean like shit? - Your son. - My son. - And Molly? - Moll lived with that cancer for seven years. It was her time. - It just didn't seem right. - I'm doing this different now, Ashley. I'm doing it the right way. I'm finding out who did this to my son. I'ma watch him get justice served. - Of course. - [Frank] You still work in the DA? - [Ashley] No, I've got a private practice now. - You still have people in the DA's office? - [Ashley] Of course. - [Frank] I'm gonna talk to an old foreman, see if I can get some information. (whistling) - [Man] Yo, Jinx is in the alley waiting for you. - Oh, there's that motherfucker. (chuckling) Look who it fucking is! I just got the fuck out of prison, man. You planted evidence on me. I did three fucking years. - I'm sorry to hear it. - What's that, motherfucker? - I guess, what I remember was that you sold some dirty drugs to some kids and they all fucking OD'd and died. And the jury didn't convict. - It's a free country, motherfucker. (bashing) Ah, you fucker! (cracking) (screaming) God dammit, fucking ethel! (bashing) (bashing) (clanking) - No problems here, man. - [Jinx] Fuck! - [Frank] Next time I call, you give me the information I need. - [Jinx] Fuck you. - [Frank] Thanks for nothing. ¶ Look ¶ ¶ I'm a rap man, my bitch a bad one ¶ ¶ We be counting up and fucking till morning ¶ ¶ I beat it up ¶ - What's up? - What's up bro? - Stay heat right here. - Yeah. Oh shit, that's that fight? - Yeah. All right. - All right. (car honking) (revving) Yo. Hey bro, you better watch yourself. What's wrong with you? Need something to lighten up, huh? - Shut your mouth. - [Hooker] Hey papi, how are you doing today, huh? - Hey baby. - Hey man, hey man, hey man. - Two for one again, eh? - Fuck you man. - Hey don't walk away, you pussy. - Fuck is your problem, man? - Hey fuck you. - Fuck you, pussy. - Fuck that guy. Fuck you! - I need a room. - I got a room down the hall. I'll get you some fresh sheets. - What about that kid's room? The one who got killed. - What the hell do you wanna stay at a murdered kid's room for? - He's my son. (low droning music) (somber music) - Look, goddamit, I'm leaving. You can't stop me this time! - Your mother will kill me, Chance. - Yeah, well mine's dead. So she can't not forgive shit anymore. - You watch the way you talk about your mom, boy. She's always watching over us. - Yeah. Is that why you never had to put down the bottle? - That city will change you. It will get into your blood like a virus and eat you alive. You want that? - At least it would turn me into something. This? This ain't no life here. I'm sorry, Dad. I'm sorry. (whooshing) (ominous music) (gasping) (phone buzzing) (hip hop music) - All right, all right, you savages wanna hear a joke? Good one? Really, you're gonna like this one. All right, Sadie, she's in the old age home, right? She's got dementia. She wears this little tiny nightie and she goes around knocking on all the doors of all the guys that live there and when they open the door, she starts pulling up her nighty going "Super pussy, super pussy!" She knocks on Herschel's door, right? Herschel answers the door. She starts pulling up her nightie, "Super pussy, super pussy!" Herschel looks at her for a second and he says, "I'll take the soup." (men laughing) It's a good line, "Super Pussy" - [Man] Haha, good one. Lighten up man. (phone ringing) - [Man] That's actually not bad. - Hey, shut up, shut up, shut up. - Who is this? (tense music) Let's try this again. I'm Chance's father. Who is this? (beeping) - Who was it? - Nobody. Fucking deal. - Oh, goddamn, mmm. - Right, place the final bets. Thank you my friends, now we'll spin this. ¶ You can have it all, all baby ¶ ¶ You can have it all, all baby ¶ - All right. Place your final bets. All right, let's spin. - I'm writing jail about Chance. Everything that you know about him, I need to know. - He got in pretty deep playing cards. He spent money that he didn't have all the time. - And you know where he got it? - Chance wouldn't tell me anything about that. I could tell that he was getting worried though. Whoever it was, they started making threats. - I saw on Chance's phone some dude, Desmond Packard. - I've seen him come in a couple times. He hangs around sketchy people. - He won money from that dude? - He wouldn't tell me. Listen, I did care about him. But you didn't know him. I mean just ask anybody. You mention Chance's name and they all have some bad story about him. - And you still stayed with him? - I better go back to work now. It's great seeing you. ¶ You can have it all, all baby ¶ ¶ You can have it all, all baby ¶ ¶ You can have it all, all baby ¶ ¶ You can have it all, all baby ¶ (tense music) - What the fuck? I think my eyes must be playing tricks on me. I hate to sound like a walking, talking cliche but I thought you was dead. - Oh. Lot of confidence in me, huh? - What are you drinking? - [Frank] I'll take a double vodka. I do need some information. - Old habits die hard. - The name is Desmond Packard. - Packard, huh? - [Frank] Yeah. - He's Augustino Finn Adair's kid. Yeah he was the bastard of some broad Finn knocked up apparently. He still goes by her last name. Now, since she passed, I guess the kid wanted to go work with his daddy. And you know, Finn, he's always looking for a loyal helping hand, so he agreed. And he showed him the ropes like only he could. - [Frank] Playing the cards? - He runs a card game once a week. The house always wins. - Can you help me find them? - (sighs) He hangs out at the Razor Room every Thursday night. Shithole club over on the west side. You're not thinking of walking in there like you're Dirty Harry or something, are you Frank Wilson? 'Cause with your reputation, it'll be silly of me to think you wouldn't, right? - I'm not a cop anymore. - Once a cop, always a cop. (lighter clinking) - [Desmond] How are the numbers, man? - Same old, same old. - How you doing, son? - [Desmond] Good, Pop. - All right. Can I have the usual? - Yes, sir. (tense music) - Give me a minute, bro. - What's on your mind, Dad? - I was thinking about the family. I was hoping you could kind of open up to me and talk to me. I don't like to really talk too much about myself but it seems like I've done as much as I possibly can for you. You know I love you, son. And I would step in front of a motherfucking bullet if I had to. But I can't really teach you if you don't listen. - I do listen. - Rather than being stupid and arrogant, and thinking you're smarter than everybody else, I wanted to try to beg you one last time to act right. - I've always given you respect, Dad. - Well, we just have sort of a different way of living a life. So I'm gonna say this one more time. I would really, really, highly consider getting rid of your criminal friends, treating people the way you want to be treated, bring something good into this life. Because we at the crossroads now and if you make the wrong decisions, you gonna fuck up the rest of your family, you're gonna end your own life. - I've done nothing wrong, Dad. - You got something to say to me? - No sir. I got nothing to say. - You got nothing? - No. Not a thing. (clinking) (sighs) ¶ See the flow is so smooth ¶ ¶ Holy dope ¶ ¶ I was paid she told you told you ¶ ¶ That homie certain ¶ ¶ I'm so little blinded bee ¶ ¶ These tiny slivers ¶ ¶ Would you switch the finest is it ¶ ¶ In IG pictures ¶ - May I help you? - [Frank] Yeah. - Anything in particular you're looking for? - Desmond. Packard. - You need anything? - Let me have a beer. - Hey baby. Why don't you come sit over here? - That's it, baby. (groaning) (laughing) - Yeah? - This cop wants a word. - Who the fuck are you? - Desmond Packard. - One and only, baby. - You got a problem? - No. You got a minute? - Talk. - Well, a little bit loud in here for my old ears so, - You don't need cops here. - Thank you, Terrence. Let's go. Have fun, daddy's gotta work. Stay. You ain't from around here, are you? - No. - So what the fuck you want to talk about? - I think you know my son Chance. - No, doesn't ring a bell. - It's weird, 'cause, I found his phone and the last number that was called was some dude named Desmond. (tense music) - A lot of people got my number. - Well, Mr. Popularity, huh? - Yeah. I'm kind of a big deal. - Hey, Mr. Popular. You kill my son? - I don't know where you're from. But you should scurry back there as quickly as possible. Okay right now you're in my city. And there's a good possibility you're gonna get hurt. Or even killed. (bashing) (groaning) Oh, motherfucker! - Thanks for the gun. - Fuck you, man! Fuck you! - The fuck, man? - What's up? The fuck? What is this? - It's a gun. I need you to see if it matches ballistics on the bullet pulled from Chance's body. - Look, you're not a cop anymore. You can't keep running around here acting like one. - Just pull the fucking ballistics, please. - Why'd you quit the force? - The better question is why did I join in the first place? And the answer to that is I have no fucking idea. Check for ballistics. (tense music) - You called. What do you want? - I was wondering. You get your ass kicked lately? - Fuck you. - Fuck you! I'm afraid to even ask how he got it. - [Desmond] Then don't. - Guy used to be a cop. He asked me to run ballistics on it. - Give me. - Uh-uh, not so fast. I mean I could just turn it in. Evidence alone will get you 30 years. If I was you I'd just get rid of it before someone else shows up and takes it from you. - Anything else, Detective? - Yeah. I got a feeling this guy's not gonna rest till he gets justice for his son. - Yeah, whatever. Me and the boys can take care of him. - Well then you and the boys might need to know where he's staying. - I fucking hate cops. (revving) (ticking) (phone ringing) - Hello. - Finn. The kid is in a lot of trouble. - You sure about that? - He killed the son of a cop. - Really? Let me talk to my people and I'll get right back to you here. Later, cool. (sighs) (door creaking) (tense music) - Hey man. I heard what you said the other day after you whipped my ass. Got a story you might be interested in. It's at some strip bar, about a girl named Charlotte. Yeah, she was looking to buy some weight, a lot of it. Hey man. Hey! We square, man? The fuck? (tense music) (car starting) - [Frank] Charlotte. - Mr. Wilson? How do you know where my parents live? - Old habits die hard. Nice place. You got a minute? - What did you wanna talk about, Mr. Wilson? - You took that money. You know. - I didn't mean to. I loved Chance. - Well. Your greed got him killed. - I didn't mean for this to happen. You know what it's like. I just wanted to get out of here, I just wanted to leave this place and everything forever! And I was waiting for things to settle down but Chance didn't wanna leave. He was never gonna leave this place. Not even for me. - Well, so it may be here. - Wait, please! You have to believe me. I did love him. - You loved him? - I loved him. - Mistakes. God knows we all have them. Tough part, you have to live with it. Forever. I suggest leave town because if I found you I wonder who else will. Good luck, Charlotte. (door opening and shutting) - What happened to your face? You killed that boy. You killed that poor fucking young man, Chance. It's not like I'm dumb enough to fucking not know. I tried to get you to come clean. - How was I supposed to know? He's just some junky kid. He's just a nobody. - Who the fuck you think you are making judgements on who should live and who should die? Everybody's somebody. I know Chance's father Frank Wilson. I know him real well. He's the dirtiest fucking cop I ever knew and he was the dirtiest cop they had on the force. Now, I might have to figure out how to deal with this because he's the kind of guy where either he gonna have to die or we're one to die. And I'm not fitting to die for this. - We'll take care of it. We know where he's staying. I'll put a bullet in his fucking head. - You will take care of it for me? - Yeah. - Yeah. I feel like I'm talking to a retarded child. Don't do nothing. - He took my gun. Did this to my face. What do you want me to do? - I need time to think about this. You don't do nothing. Don't do fucking nothing. (door shutting) (ticking) (ominous music) - Dad! Dad! Help me! (coughing) (tense music) - My wife's gonna kill me if I get shot. - I'll turn her into a widow myself if you don't shut the fuck up. - We keep following you, we're all dead. - Are you getting this? - This asshole. All right. - Clear. - Come on. - Clear. Get in there. - Take it. - Clear! Clear. - Shit, he's not here. Dammit! He's not fucking here. - Now where the fuck is he? - Well he ain't here so let's get the hell out of here. - Well we got to get a fucking clue to find out where this guy is. He's hunting me in my own fucking city. (crashing in distance) - What the fuck is that? - The fuck? (car honking and alarm sounding) My fucking car! (bird chirping) - What's up, man? - I figure I'd stop by, check on you. Make sure you're all right. - Courtesy check? Fuck wouldn't I be all right? - Well I heard about the incident. - Incident. - The incident with the car. - I heard some sirens, some shit like that. What happened? - It was right out in front. His car, on fire. - Well, shit. Guess that's why they call it theme park for outlaws, right? - [Munce] Right. - [Frank] Get those test results back yet? - Test results? - Ballistics, Detective. - Oh yeah, no. Yeah, that takes a while. You know, backed up and everything. But you'll be the first to know. You're not going anywhere, are you? - I'm gonna head home. - Really? - Well there's not shit here for me, is there? - Right. Gimme a call in a couple days for those test results. (tense music) - Hmm. - So I spoke with the Special Investigation Division. Thank you so much. And you were right. They have no record of the bullet or the gun that you gave Munce. I mean, what the hell does Munce have to do with this? What are you gonna do? - I need to shit. Gonna go home. - What? - Look. They already came after me once. They'll probably come after me again. Now if I'm at my house, that's self-defense. (tense music) (door creaking) - The hell you doing in my house?! - Your name Swilley? - That's what they call me, yeah. - Where is Frank Wilson? (tense music) (guns cocking) (gun firing) (intense music) (gun cocking) (gun cocking) - Oh shit. (gun firing) (screaming) (gun cocking) - No, no. No, wait, wait. No, no, wait, no! Wait, wait. (gun firing) (gun firing) - [Man] Got him. - [Desmond] Are you fucking sure? - [Man] Yeah I'm sure, man, let's get out of here, come on. - I wanna know that motherfucker's dead. - He's dead, I killed him. - Attaboy, get in the fucking car. Fuck you, bitch! (heartbeat pulsing) (bashing) - Help me! (gun firing) (somber music) - He doesn't look very good. - I'm Detective Munce. I'm with the police department. - Ashley Millet. - Yeah, I'm in charge of the investigation involving Mr. Wilson's son. - What can we do for you, Detective? - Well I heard he was injured. Figured I'd come by and ask him a few questions. - Does he look like he's in the place to answer goddamn questions to you? - You guys see anything? - No. I heard a shotgun blast. Got somebody to help me drag him out the water and call 911. We flew him here to this goddamn place, middle of the city. The last place he wanna die on the globe if he had his choice. - You have any idea who might have wanted to do this? - Oh, I thought that was your department, Detective. Course it could have been anybody these days. World's going to hell in a handbasket. - Right. Well, you have a way I can get in touch with you? - Yeah. Here you go. - Have Mr. Wilson give me a call as soon as he wakes up. - Okay, will do. - I don't like that fellow. - So? He's still breathing? - Barely. He's with that fucking swamp rat of his. He said he didn't get a good look at you but he's obviously lying. And they're not alone. - Ashley Millet, attorney-at-law. So who's this bitch? - Seems like your problems keep multiplying with water, Gizmo. - Gizmo? - Gremlins, it's a fucking movie. Watch it. It's a classic. - You wanted to talk to me? - I'm tired of telling you over and over and over again the same motherfucking thing. And it break my heart boy to have to talk to you like this, you a grown man. What happened to you, boy? You treat us all like this. You put us all in harm's way. And you cross the line. If you had a soul, I feel like it's unretrievable. You lost that the day you killed that boy. I don't mind if you had to kill somebody. But not like that. - At least I do my own killing. And I like it. - You're no longer my son. - Hey you were never a real father. You just pose like one. - You're gonna have to go on the road now. - I did the best I could to be what you wanted. - You could have fooled me. - It's never good enough. Not for you. - You got precious little time, son. People are coming for you. And I don't wanna watch you die. - If he's coming for me, I'm gonna kill him first. - Get on up the road, boy. - You got it. Watch your back. (snapping) (tense music) The old man doesn't have what it takes to run the business anymore. I need you to talk to your supplier, plan out how to get with the new boss. - You got it, boss. - I'm serious, you go. You have work to do. Those fish ain't gonna catch themselves. - Are you sure? - I'm sure. You've done enough already. You're a good friend, Swilley. - Well, if he comes to his senses and if you need anything, you call me. And I do mean anything, all right? - Okay, I will. I'll take good care of him. Bye. - Now I need you to do something for me. Desmond and I have a little something that needs shipping we need you to send over. Not a word to the boss. Don't even talk about this conversation with Desmond, you understand? - (chuckles) If the price is right, I do. - Just you and me, yeah? You got it? You like money? - Who doesn't? - The price will be right. Deal? - Deal. - All right. (groaning) (clears throat) (door creaking) (lighter clicking) - You want something, boy? - Boo. I gotta say, I'm impressed. I never thought two old hillbillies would be so hard to snuff. - You hurt one of us, you fight all of us. That's what family does. - Wow. Ain't that some heroic shit. - Oh no, thank you. - What, you worried it's gonna kill you? - I was born dying, no. I've been waiting all my life. You just gave me a reason. - Wow. That is a depressing outlook, old man. - No, not if you use it to make the most of the time you got. - Is that what you've been doing out here in this shit shack? - I wouldn't expect your city ass to understand. (chuckles) - The woman. Who is she, what does she know? - Just an old friend of Frank's. She ain't involved in this. - How about you? Do you talk to the cops? - People out here, we don't talk to no police. There's a problem, we settle it ourselves. Sort of a tradition. - You know I got some traditions of my own I can show you? - You gonna shoot me or bore me to death? I got family up there waiting on me up there where I'm gonna go. So I don't need to listen to a little boy trying to sound like a man when he's just a piece of shit wrapped in human skin. (tense music) (clacking) (gun firing) (birds chirping) (tense music) (phone buzzing) - Yeah, I'm at the bar. - Drinking on the job, Detective? - You know an officer that doesn't? We work at one of the toughest cities in the country. - Oh, it ain't no Chicago. - Surprised your boys haven't taken care of this guy yet. - Yeah, look. You know what you do when you get an itch, right? - Scratch it? - You rub it out. Consider it a donation from Tino Finn Adair and Desmond Packard. Get it done. - Piece of shit. - Would you like another? - Just give me the bottle. No, just give me the bottle. The bottle, the bottle, I'll take the bottle. (tense music) - Frank. - Mmm. Oh my god. Hey. I'm in the hospital? - Yeah. - Great. Where's Swilley? - He's fine, he went back to work. He was here all night. - Okay, I'm gonna need to get out of here. - Oh no, no, no. You stay, you have to rest. You stay. (phone ringing) Hold on a sec. Hello? What? - What do you mean what? I need to borrow your car again. - What happened with you just wanting some answers? - He's all I had left, Ash. - You have to stop blaming yourself for everything, Frank. Even Swilley would tell you that. - Swilley's not here to tell me anything anymore, is he? And I'll stop blaming myself when I stop being the cause. (door shutting) (tense music) (beeping) - Yo Frank, we need to have a conversation. (bashing) (thudding) (phone ringing) - Hello? - [Munce] Miss Millet? This is Detective Munce. - Yes? - I'm looking for Mr. Wilson. I heard he was released from the hospital and I have those ballistics results he was asking about. - And so what did it say? - I can't give up any more information on the phone. But have you seen him? Or maybe you know where he's at? - It's your lucky day, I'm right here. - Frank? Listen. Yeah I got those ballistics results. I could be by Chance's apartment in a couple of hours. Why don't you meet me there? - See you then. (car starting) - [Ashley] Like I said, the DA's office will leave your son's name off the report for the robbery. But they need something on Augustino Finn Adair. It's the only way. - Yeah. Goodbye. - Just be careful. - I wish you the best, okay? (siren sounding in distance) (tense music) How long has it been? - How long has what been? - Since you've been on the take, Munce. I got this off one of your boys who tried to kill me at the hospital. - What are you, a fucking saint? Don't act so goddamn righteous! - Motherfucker, I've never been called that. Yeah. I've corrupted evidence, lied, killed motherfuckers because I knew they were guilty. And I did all that to make sure I got the job done right. This ends tonight. You, Desmond, Finn, all going down one way or another. - 48 fucking thousand dollars a year! That's what they think my life is worth. I happen to think it's worth a little more. (bashing) (gun firing) You shot me. - This motherfucker. (lighter clinking) (phone chiming) - Now I need you to do something for me. Desmond and I have a little something that needs shipment we need you to send over. Not a word to the boss. Don't even talk about this conversation with Desmond, you understand? - [Karina] If the price is right, I do. - [Man] Just you and me, yeah? You got it? You like money? - [Karina] Who doesn't? - [Man] The price will be right, deal? - [Karina] Deal. - What the fuck is this? - Yo, boss. - You been running around behind my back with my boy! - What are you talking about? - Shut the fuck up! Don't say a motherfucking word to me! These the same gangsters that you pulled off the heist with where the money disappeared? And then y'all kill Chance. Y'all wanna be a gangster? (gun firing) That's part of the life, bitch. (tense music) (bashing) (gun firing) (groaning) - Other way. Look at me. (gun firing) (zipping) (panting) - How you doing, Frank? I've been waiting for you. (clinking) You being here, I know my son, he dead because of you. So now here we are. Here we are. Way I look at it, you killed your son. You abandoned him. He was on the street. I gave him a house. I gave him a job, I gave him food. When he passed, I'm the one who told all my people I wanna do anything and everything I can to find out who did it and bring them to justice. But I'm not fitting to kill you because of my son. I'm gonna kill you because of who you are and what you are. The world will be a lot better place without you. (bashing) (groaning) (bashing) (laughing) (gun firing) Yeah, spend the rest of your life in jail knowing I put you there. (sirens sounding) (tense music) - Wait. Wait. Please, please.
