Well thanks, I'd like to introduce you to Marco Reign. It's an honor. What can I do for you? What's he doing here? I don't know. Uh well, you know, I just wanted to show him the old stompin' grounds, we got a match coming up. That big fight whether Del Toro coming up, right? I got a lotta money on that match. Oh yeah, who you got? What do you think? BENJAMIN: And well, we were looking for a sparring partner. I'm just saying man. I'd make a better champion than that fool any day. MARCO: How 'bout that guy back there? PETE: Which one? The one hittin' the pad? That's Jameson. Hey, he's pointin' at you! You might get that shot after all. (SCOFFS) 'Bout time! Think the other guy holding the bag would be perfect. He's about the same size as Del Toro. A little older, but seasoned. My favorite fighter in the gym. Come on, come on! Let's go! He just wants somebody to dance around for a few rounds, you know. I'm sorry to make it such short notice, but, if you can give him a try? Sure. Yeah, yeah, Jameson! PETE: Come on. Rip through 'em!

Just, show this kid who ya are, right? They want someone to warm Reign up before his fight this week. You know Marco? I know his manager, Green. Long story short, Ben and I work together. He poached my fighters. That was a long time ago. Listen, don't hurt him too bad. Keep it simple. Remember, this is good for business. I'll make you look good. I promise. You always do. (SLOW BROODING MUSIC) Careful. Watch your face, we got that photo shoot. Do your thing, Marco. Let's make this quick, now. That kid's built like a freight train. Work that! COACH: Alright, do your thing. Nice feint. Stay in his face, Marco. Hey, your work on looking for, Marco. (MEN MUTTERING) PETE: Down, down! Yes, yeah! Get him down! (CROWD GROANING) (SLAMS) (CROWD GROANS) Round one is over. How you holding up? Nice throw. I got him right where I want him. Just another day in the office, man. Do what you do. Do it out there, man.

Yeah, come on, come on, come on, let's go. I'm sorry, Green! Holy! I thought it was just practice! (LAUGHS) You are something! You are (LAUGHS). That might not have been good for business, but it sure was fun to watch. (LAUGHS) Can't believe you pulled that off. I learned from the best. Here you go. You earned it. Thanks. You should head home and get some rest. Hey, Pete. You think I could've pulled that off in front of a thousand screaming fans and a bunch of TV cameras? I don't know, Ty. I mean, to him it was just practice. Plus there is something to be said for home advantage. You're probably right. Hey, Ty. I think you'd beat him if it really counted. I really do. See you tomorrow, Pete. See you. (PEOPLE IN GYM GRUNTING) Oh, Ty. Dude, that was incredible. It was just a good work out. No, no, no, no. That was fire, bro. I mean pure fire. Watch, check it out. I got it right here, watch. (PEOPLE YELLING FROM VIDEO) Being all that. Come on. You know, this is something you could show your kids. Whatever, man. You know, let's get a drink. I'm buying, come on, celebrate. Look, I'm tired, alright? I'm headed home. Rain check on that drink. Yeah. Alright, whatever you say, champ. Hey. Send me that video. You liked it. Trying to be all cool, but you liked it. Alright, you got it. (FAINT AMBIENT MUSIC) Whitney! Whitney! Whitney, come here. You never guessed what happened. I can see what happened. Jesus, Ty. Look at your face. You should see what I did to him. Come here. I wanna show you something. Is that, what's his name? Yes it is. Look at me. Damn, baby. Look, I made Marco Reign tap out. I went toe to toe with the best. I could tell my kids that I beat the best. Tell whose kids? Oh, I'm sorry. Did I say my kids? I heard my kids. I meant to say our kids. I gotta go. Kim called in sick today so I gotta work tonight. You're not gonna be working that job as longer. Well look, I'm telling you Whitney, things are really about to change for us. You know I love you baby. And I'm so proud of you. I just. I wish you would think about getting a real job. Ty. Come on, here we go. Here we go with that real job stuff again. Can we not have that conversation right now? Hey. Hey. You smile for me? Stop. Come here. Smile for me. - Stop. - Yes. See, that's what I'm talking about. That smile right there. I hate you. I know. I just want us to think about our future. That's all. This is our future. I gotta close tonight so, don't wake up. (SLOW MELLOW MUSIC) (KEYBOARD TAPPING) (PHONE VIBRATING) Hello. Hello, Ty Matthews. This is Ben Green. We didn't get a chance to be properly introduced early today but I manage Marco Reign. Yeah, I know who you are. Thanks for recommending Jameson to our gym. Yes, but I have a proposal for you. If you could come by my house tomorrow morning. I'll text you my address. Yeah. Yeah, what time? First thing in the morning. And by the way, it goes without saying, no mention of what happened earlier to anyone today, alright? Yeah, yeah, of course. Bye bye. Alright, well, I see you tomorrow. (FAINT AMBIENT MUSIC) (BIRDS CHIRPING) Hi, may I help you? Hey, my name is Ty Matthews. I'm here to see Benjamin Green. Great, come here. Please wait for Mr. Green in the office. TY: Thank you. Yes, ready? Okay, thank you, dear. Ty Matthews! Have a seat, take a load off. This is a really, really nice place you have here, Mr. Green. Thank you. You got a little butterfly there when he did a little work on you. Yeah, it's just part of the game. It is, yeah. Have you given any thought to your future? I haven't yet. Well, I think you're hell of a fighter. You got a lot to learn but you got great potential. What are you saying? I'm saying I like to manage you. Wow. I'm honored, Mr. Green. I think I'm gonna have to stick with Pete. You know, I mean he's been like a father figure to me and I think I'm gonna have to roll with him on this. You sure about that? Yeah, I mean I'm very appreciative but just feel like I need to be loyal to Pete. No, I get that. Alright that just, so there's no misunderstanding, here's $10,000 and there you go. What's that? Well, if you're not on my team, you're against me. So, that's a non-disclosure agreement. No lawsuits, no bullshit. That's it, you keep your mouth shut about yesterday. Alright? Alright, what if I don't? Now. Then I'll say you got kicked in the head once too often. What are you gonna benefit by saying you got a sucker move that you used to get Marco in a headlock? Rear naked choke is a sucker move? I mean Marco used that in his last title fight against Lake. Now listen to me, son. This is a billion dollar industry. This is a business model. Now, Marco is up here and you, Ty, are way down here. And I can't have you me meddling in things that are way, way beyond your comprehension. Now, I don't care how good a fighter you are. I can't have you hemorrhage in my business over a stupid sparring match. Now, just sign that and I don't wanna hear about yesterday ever again. How old are you? Hm? 34. 34, well I understand, I see you're almost at the, the end of your prime. And you got something to prove and you haven't had a chance. But this can be your chance now. See, you just that. And I never wanna hear about this again. Now, take the money, enjoy it. There are two copies. One for you, one for me. There you go. I'll take that one. Sign the other. Okay. (FAINT AMBIENT MUSIC) Aisha! TY: Who is this? VICTORIA: You emailed me about a story. TY: Victoria? VICTORIA: Are we meeting or not? How about at Maly's, 10 o'clock? I can do that. VICTORIA: Better not be bullshitting me. TY: I made Marco Reign tap out. VICTORIA: I'll see you at Maly's, 10 o'clock sharp. I wish you would think about getting a real job. (FAINT AMBIENT MUSIC) Now, Marco is up here and you, Ty, are way down here. TY: You think I could've pulled that off in front of a thousand screaming fans and a bunch TV cameras? I don't know, Ty. I mean, to him it was just practice. I think you'd beat him if it really counted. ♪ Just too late ♪ ♪ For tears ♪ ♪ Our dance too late ♪ ♪ Too late to cry ♪ ♪ Oh but it's too late ♪ Ty. - Victoria. - Yes. I didn't think you gonna show up. I know, I am so sorry that I'm late. Here, let's get a table. You wanna drink? Yeah, sure. Hi, what can I get you? Hi. I'll have a Scotch, neat and whatever he wants. Buck on the rocks. Got it. Thank you. (SIGHS) Thank you for waiting. No problem. I'm gonna be really honest. I know there are a lot of fighters that are better than the big names but they don't have managers like Ben Green giving kickbacks to the league. He and I had a very interesting conversation today. Yeah? Yeah. I think this story is the first step to change the entire game. For the record. Cool. Here you go. VICTORIA: Thank you. Thanks. So, Ty Matthews. Now that was a sparring session, not a real fight? No, I'd beat him in a real fight. Oh yeah, what makes you think so? Look, there are guys that don't even wanna lose in practice. He's one of them. Got a little too cocky. I saw an opportunity and I took it. That must've felt good. Better than sex. Could you describe that? The fight or sex? Whatever you prefer. (LAUGHS) Well, I prefer not to talk about sex. Why not? I don't think my girlfriend would like it too much. Ah, so you've a girlfriend. Yeah. You don't seem too happy about that. No, I love her. It just we're not on the best terms right now. Okay. So, we have to talk about something else. Let's talk about how I think you need another drink. ♪ I love you ♪ ♪ You love me ♪ (GIGGLES) Yeah, I don't know where I'd be without him. How did you two meet? Have you known him most of your life? My mom died when I was 13. Pete took me when I ran away from a foster care. Well, he sounds more like a father than a trainer. Yeah. When I had nowhere to go, he took me in. Gave me job at the gym. And he taught me how to fight. I'll probably in jail if wasn't for him. I'm sorry. It's okay. I think you should show me how you beat Marco. I can't show people that video. But I can have my guy from the gym show you. Well, I don't wanna see the video and I don't want your friend at the gym to show me either. I want you to show me. Right here? Yeah, right here. No. Yeah. I want you to show me. You know you gonna get me thrown in jail for doing it especially like this? You know I'll keep your ass out of jail. Don't be a pussy, you can do it. Don't be a pussy? Mm-hm. I knew that would do to you. So, I slid my arm around his neck like this. This is called a rear naked choke. Well, I like the name of it. Then I grab my own bicep. Uh-huh. And lock my hand behind his head like this. Yeah? Yeah. Just like this? TY: Just like this. So, is this as hard as you can go?

Where were you? I went out with Pete for a drink. And he got wasted and spilled vodka all over me. I mean how you that old and you still can't hold your liquor? That's crazy, right? Crazy. I don't even recognize this face anymore without cuts and bruises. I love you. I know. I'm gonna take a shower. WHITNEY: Yeah. (FAINT AMBIENT MUSIC) (MOANING) TY: Beneath your head from like that. Yeah. I can still smell it. Hey. Where can I find Peter Mack? You could find him in the back somewhere. JOHN: Alright, what's he look like? GUY: Black guy, red jacket. What happened to your ear? Man, I was getting down with this chick, right. She's hot too she used to being grab my ear and scratch my shit. Maybe you shouldn't been put in on her like that. Come on now, you know how I gotta rip with zip for the team, right? Come on. Who's that? I don't know. Probably that's your boyfriend. JOHN: Your Peter Mack? Yeah, why? You own this place? How can I help you? I'm looking for Ty Matthews. He working out here today? What did he do? Oh, I can't say but off the record, I think it has to do with a lady. I think a lady has a gripe and I gotta follow through. So Ty, my goodness. Ty and the ladies. Yeah, well. Come on, I'll introduce you. Don't tell me don't miss those days. Yeah. Hey Ty, this mas has a few questions for you. Ty Matthews, how are you? Yeah, who are you? I'm Detective John Beckett. I just got a couple of questions. If you don't mind. Pete, what's this all about? You tell me. No, it's alright. I'd rather not talk here. I'd rather go to somewhere a little more private like down in my office. I'll be back inside an hour. If you wanna come talk to me, 'right. You don't have to. It's unofficial. But you'll help me out. Fucking asshole. Not you, me. You can't have this up here. I was supposed to check it in downstairs. Have your permission to look inside? Otherwise, I gotta go downstairs and check it up. Sure. Are there scissors here or anything sharp? Knife or razor blade and where you cut? No. You know. I got this ex-partner, Jimmy. He's obsessed with Asian culture, you know. Like tai chi, martial arts, married an Asian girl. Anyway, he's got me drinking 32 ounces of warm water everyday when I wake up. I've been doing it for like four weeks now. The philosophy or the ideology behind it is that your body has been sleeping for four, six, eight, 10 hours a night, right? You're completely dehydrated when you wake up. So, this, when you drink the water, it kick starts your system and reboots it and I'm telling you, it flushes your whole system because nothing in your body, nothing there, it's like a plunger, the water goes down, everything out, everything clean. Hey, what is this have to do with me? Nothing. I figured since you were an athlete, maybe you heard of that. You're a boxer, right? No, I practice MMA. Practice MMA. You hit people for a living, yeah? You could say that. Would you say that you're a violent person? But man, what's this all about? Do I need a attorney or something? I don't know. Do you? (RECORDER BEEPS) VICTORIA: So, Ty Matthews. So that was just a sparring session, not a real fight? TY: I would beat him in a real fight. VICTORIA: Oh yeah, what makes you think so? TY: Look, there's some guys that don't even wanna lose in practice. He's one of them. He got a little too cocky. I saw an opportunity and I took it. VICTORIA: That must've felt good. TY: Better than sex. That's Victoria Mata, was voice you heard on the tape. You know her right? Yeah. What time was the interview? 10 p.m. What did you do after the interview? I went home. What time was that? Fuck, man. I don't know. JOHN: Think. I go home at 12:30. You can ask my girl, she'll vouch for me. But the meeting with Victoria start was at 10 p.m. She was a little late. Tell me. The tape's only 30 minutes long, what did you do in the rest of the time? She's a good looking girl. Have a predilection for fighters. Maybe she added you up. Flirted with you a little bit, touched your leg. You guys got a little liquored up, maybe. And she takes ya home back home to her place and things get out of hand. One thing leads to another and. What are you talking about? Well, a predilection for fighters means that she liked you. She had a thing for... No, no man. What do you mean things things got out of hand? (SIGHS) JOHN: She was strangled to death. She's dead? (YELLS) (CHUCKLES) Do you think I killed her? I don't know. Why would I kill her? I don't know. What was that thing you said on the tape? You said winning a fight is better than sex. Is that true? Speaking of hydration, I gotta take a piss. Can I get you anything? No. Emmy set time of death somewhere around 3 a.m. Cause of death? She was strangled. The guy's an MMA fighter. CHIEF: Anything else like DNA, tissues, semen in the victim? We'll have it later tonight. Forensics is working on it. CHIEF: How about the girlfriend? She works at a nail salon, I'm gonna go talk to her now. You know it just works. Get to it. I know what you did. You know what you did so let's just cut the shit. I didn't do anything. You at least fucked her. That much is for sure. What do you mean? Are you gonna sit here and tell me that nothing happened between you two? I mean she interviewed me. That's about it. How'd you do it? Huh? You get to do things to her that your girlfriend won't let you? That's how it happened, isn't it? I'm not saying another word to you. And where's my phone call? I wanna call my trainer. You can call whoever you want. But just so you know, Ty, I will find out exactly what happened eventually. Enjoy your phone call. Yeah? Hanged up. ANGELA: Whitney? Yeah. I need to speak with you? I'm on my break, actually but one of the other girls can help you out. This is regarding your boyfriend, Ty Matthews. So you said he was home right around 12:30. So, would you say definitely before 1 a.m.? Yeah, he was definitely home. Okay. Is he in trouble? He might be. Is that blood? What? On your shirt. Oh, yeah. I always get blood on me from patching up Ty. It's old. Does Ty have any new cuts on his face or anywhere on him last night? Ty has new cuts every night. Have you told in there what you just told me? What, that I slept with the reporter? No. Not yet. But Whitney's my girl. And I love her. But it felt good to have somebody care 'bout what I do for a change. Do you want me to drive you home or somewhere else? Not home. Listen, you have to open up to Whitney. Well, thank you very much, Whitney, for your time. Give me a call if you think you have anything else. (THUDS) 3:36. 3:36? You got home last night at 3:36. Some detective came to my job today. Want to know what time you got home. What did you say? I lied, Ty. To the police. Trying to protect your ass. So won't you tell me where you really where? Oh, just sit down. I think I'm gonna stand right here and let you tell me what the fuck is going on. I met with a reporter that wanted to do a story on me beating Marco. You beating Marco in practice? Yeah. Then Ben Green gave me $10,000 not to post the video of me beating Marco. Who the hell is Ben Green? He's Marco's manager. Check the dresser. Go on, bottom drawer. (GLOOMY AMBIENT MUSIC) Why didn't you just tell me? Well, Green paid me to shut my mouth. Okay, I even had to sign this thing. This does not change the fact that I had to lie to the police for you. And what is this thing you signed? We can't take this guy suing us, Ty. She was murdered. Alright baby, the reporter I talked to, she's dead. God. Police think I killed her. Come on, Whitney. I've done a lot of fucked up shit in my life but I'm not a killer. But something happened between you two. Right? I gotta go. Alright, I gotta go clear my head. Look, when I come back, we can talk more. Just know I love you. Very much. I will never do anything to hurt our relationship. Okay? ANNOUNCER: And here we are. Here we are, the final fight. The final round, round five. Del Toro and Marco Reign. Fighters, they're at it again. They're at it again. BOOMER: Where are you from, baby? MAN: Yeah she worked hard for that much, she worked hard.

Let me get out three shots of whiskey for that losers over there. MAN: Get the fuck outta here! Of course. Just a minute. Can you believe this fight? Those guys over there, they bet for the other guy. Nobody beats Marco Reign. It's my guy right there. I did. What did you say? Did you say somethin'? Speak up, boy. That's what I thought. I said I did. Hold up, boys, hold up. I got this. Take your fucking drink, get the fuck outta here. Talking shit talkers, boys. Think they can hit the gym, think they can fight. I would whoop up his ass. MAN: Talk smart, Boomer. Trying to mess up our festivities here. MAN: Nah, not tonight, Boomer. Doesn't he know this is what we do? He sustained wounds, his first puck. Come on, now get the fuck outta here, man. Let me ask you something, you work on Tuesdays? Yeah, I work here almost every night. You have to see her before? Yeah, she was here the other night, sitting over there with some guy. This guy? (HIGH INTENSITY DEEP MUSIC) Boy, huh? Fucking cocksucker! (THUDS) Fuck you boy. Motherfucker-doo. (THUDS) I'm not giving this gym rat a fight on TV. Five million dollars said you will. You think? You'll make more on this fight than the last three fights combined. Where are you gonna make that kind of money? I got an idea. Oh shit! I couldn't help but the notice the kinky shud. A kinky shud? Kinky how? Like at one point, he came from behind her and like had his arm around her neck. It's a little weird but didn't make anything other, and it looked she like it. They leave together? Yeah. (PANTING) If you hear anything else, if you remember something, please call me. Ugh. (POLICE SIREN WAILING) (PHONE BEEPS) (PHONE RINGING) Hey Jameson, what are you doing? JAMESON: Look at you superstar. Almost a million views. Yeah, I sign something that's saying I couldn't post that video. JAMESON: Oh man, my bad. Just want people to know who the real champ is. You ain't mad, are you? I woke you up? I'm sorry. Kit came back. Yeah, Ty's DNA matches the semen found in Mata. What time did they leave the bar that night? The server said late. So they flirted pretty heavily. He's our guy, I know it. His woman is lying to us. Let me go talk to her. You know, girl to girl. Okay. (THUDS) Hey. Hey Ty, Ty Matthews? Can I help you? Sure and you certainly can. I am doing a piece on you for the National Tribune. I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions. May take a few minutes of your time? Hey Ty! TY: Yeah? Please forget about the woman. Come, come with me! Comin' now, Pete. Hey, you know, maybe we should this another time. Okay, well here's my contact. Just call me, stay in touch. TY: Okay. REPORTER: Promise? PETE: Ty! Close the door behind you, would you? Liked the video. Well, I guess you want your money back. No, not necessarily. Marco liked it. So the two million other people. Thank you for meeting me. Have a seat. Can I get you something to drink? Are you trying to tell me that I'll need one? Maybe. So how does a hundred thousand dollars sound to you? Sounds like a lot of money. Well, congratulations. This is your lucky day, Ty. They want you to fight Marco for the title. Finally get your fight with Marco. When? Two weeks. Our event, our rules. You know that's not enough time for anyone to be ready for a fight like this. Yes, it is. You think Ty killed that reporter? I don't know if he did. He maybe has a legitimate alibi. I will beat him anytime, any rules, any place, whenever. I was hoping you'd day that. Do we have a deal? Whitney. I know this isn't easy for you. But you know why I brought you here? I brought you to this bar because this is the last place Victoria was seen alive with Ty. Right here. This seat in particular. This is where Ty sat the night she died and you, Whitney, you were seating where Victoria sat. I'll have to send the details over later. Pete, I assume you're his manager. Well, I have to discuss... Yeah. He's my manager. Well, good. I will leave you. You guys have a lot of work to do. Got a title fight, Pete. And then he reached over. Kinda like this. And he brushed the hair off of her face. He had sex with her. His DNA matches the semen we found inside of her. This man, he isn't who you think he is. He's dangerous. The man that you sleep next to, that man is a killer. So let me help you. Are you sure that Ty was home by 12:30? (CHUCKLES SILENTLY) (MELLOW AMBIENT MUSIC) WHITNEY: What's the matter, baby? I'm getting a hundred thousand dollars to fight Marco. You serious? I can't leave it, babe. Yeah. I've been waiting my whole life, for a title fight. It's crazy. (BREATHING HEAVILY) (MOANING) (BREATHING HEAVILY) Are you scared? Ty. (MOANING) This is what you want? Yeah, harder. Harder. Choke me. Choke me like you choked that white girl. What did you say? (WHITNEY SOBBING) Whitney. What was that? You know I love you. More than anything in this world. I love you too, baby. Then why would you fuck her? Jesus, Ty. They found your semen inside her. And now she's dead. I messed up. Okay, I just wanted her to do a story on me and she kept comin' on to me. Right, it's poor fucking Ty! Right? It's always somebody else's fault. I wish you had killed her. Come on, Whitney. No. Funny, no! Don't. Good luck on your fight, and just stay the fuck away from me. Just. (GRUNTING) How do you get in here? Pete, I've been breaking in this place since I was a kid. Take a rest. I'ma beat Reign. (GRUNTS) I already beat him once. Green tried to scare me but I don't care. I'm gonna beat that fool again, but this time, the whole world's gonna see it. (PANTING) But I need your help. You know I will help you. I really do. But I have to know something first. Did you do it? Not you. Are you serious? Not you too. I have to know, Ty. How can you ask me something like that? I mean do you really think I killed this girl? You got to see this from my side. I have the cops comin' in here telling me one thing, Green, telling me another. What the fuck did Green say? I just have to hear from you. What happened? What do you think happened? Just can't imagine you would kill that girl but I don't know. This is crazy! So fucking thing is crazy! Listen, Ty. You've been like a son to me but... Go fuck yourself, Pete. Go fuck yourself. Ty! (FAINT MELLOW AMBIENT MUSIC) (THUDS) Unless she ask me what I had on him. I had it hard on him. And I know you can smell it. (LAUGHS) Crazy bitches these days, huh. MAN: Yeah, Joey. TY: Joey!

(SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Do you understand them rights that I just sentenced to you? - Ty? - You have the right if might you wish to waive these rights. Ty? Ty, what's happening? What did he do? What did he do? What the hell happened? This man at a bar. He started a fight with me. You're gotta be kidding me. With everything that's going on right now, you couldn't just ignore some asshole at a bar? I know, baby. You're right. There's always an excuse with you. Always some reason why the whole world is against you. This time, you really did it to yourself. Got the money for your fight. It's all going to the lawyer. Who you gonna blame for that? Whitney. I love you, baby. I love you too. It's just not enough, sometimes. I gotta go. I'll try to come and visit you soon. I just need some time to clear my head. You're a trained killer who brutally assaulted a man outside a bar. And now you're going to jail for it. And while you're doing time for that, I'm gonna get you for Victoria Mata. WARDEN: You have a visitor. You're making yourself comfortable. What are you doing here? I came here to see the fighter that turned me down. You should've honored our contract. But like I said before, if you're not on our team, you're against us. But I wanna thank you for a great show (CHUCKLES). You're a hell of a fighter. I won that fight. Yeah, I know you won the fight and lost the war. Hey, if you wanna be a winner, you gotta know the game, your plan and the rules. Like your buddy. Jameson? Ah, he's a winner. And young and strong. He knows the game. (FAINT BROODING MUSIC) Oh, he would do anything the be a champion. You know, there's a lot of money to be made in this business. And I make my money by any means necessary. (BROODING AMBIENT MUSIC) You killed her, didn't you, you motherfucker. Some have a shelf life just longer than others. (BROODING AMBIENT MUSIC) Like I told you. Don't fuck with things that are way beyond your comprehension. I'm gonna get outta here. (SCOFFS) And when I do, I'm gonna kill you. I don't think you're taking this in. See, this is your home now. This cage is the only place you're gonna be fighting for a while. Why'd you do this to me? I hate to lose. I take it personally. You take care, champ. We have here this evening, Marco Reign. Of course, I'm still champ. That punk got lucky. I'll fight that guy again anytime, any place. That's including prison. (SORROWFUL AMBIENT MUSIC) TY: What happened to your ear?
