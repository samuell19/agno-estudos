[MUSIC PLAYING] [PHONE RINGING] MAN (ON PHONE): Hello? WOMAN (ON PHONE): Hello, I'm calling from Boston about your ad in the globe. MAN (ON PHONE): Oh yes? WOMAN (ON PHONE): It says woman wanted live-in. Why are you advertising in Boston, when you live in New Haven? MAN (ON PHONE): Actually, I grew up with an Irish nanny. She was kind, and generous, and pleasant to be with. WOMAN (ON PHONE): Are you married? MAN (ON PHONE): I'm widowed. I have a son in his 20s, who's um he's going through some difficulties. He lives at home and we need someone to put our house in order. -Thanks for the lift. -Thanks honey. -Yeah. -Take it easy. -Thanks. [KNOCK ON DOOR] -How do you do I'm Richard Goddard. -Hello. -I didn't think you'd be so young. My old nanny wasn't so young. -Ever? -I don't think so. -Oh, I'll get that. -Thank you. -Come on in. RICHARD: This is your kitchen. -Oh. RICHARD: I don't know what we'll do about dinner I'm not prepared. -Well I'm sure I can put something together. -I should have been prepared. [CLICK] RICHARD: Why did you do that? EMMA: The house is very dark. RICHARD: Is it? EMMA: Still is. RICHARD: It has. I guess it has. EMMA: If I wanted -One more hike and then Wendy's room. RICHARD: I'm afraid this room is dark too. -You need some hundred watters. RICHARD: You're right, that'll cure it. -Is this you? -Yes. The day of my christening. -Did you love her? -Well I I suppose I did. Yes I did. I think you'll be comfortable here. Now there is a back stairs route to the kitchen. Bathroom's around the corner, and the rest of the rooms up here are used for storage now. We had five in help in the old days. One of them stole my father's ties for her boyfriends, and another one forged his signature on checks. Caught her tracing one day. Well I'll uh leave you to your priorities. -My name is Wendell Wharton Goddard. -My name is Emma Rowena Riley. -Other people's kitchens. -It's a very large house but you won't have to do it alone. Lydia comes in once a week to help with the heavy work. I was born here. I grew up here, and when I went to college, it was a very long trip, three miles exactly I was six- WENDELL: Generation Yale. -Uh and when my father died, I had to leave the dorms and come home and tend to my mother, an old nanny, and entertain her through the years, and she was crippled with arthritis, so I pursued my doctorate from here and then of course, years later I tended to Wendell's mother who died three years ago, natural causes. -This quiche is wonderful. How on earth did you do it? -I found some eggs and cheddar. -Well you performed a miracle. -Thank you. -Welcome. -Wendell that looks serious, have you seen a doctor? -Yesterday. Eight stitches in all. -Oh. -Wendell snorted some cocaine, and then he drank a pint of vodka. Probably was afraid to come home in that condition, so he crawled up into one of those bins in a shopping mall on Dexwell avenue. -Salvation Army. -While he spent the night there sleeping it off, shortly before dawn, some suburban woman drove up and hurled a broken toaster down the chute. Left a huge gash on his forehead, and required a trip to the emergency room. -Yes well I'm very popular at the emergency room. I find them most reliable substitutions for family. They provide 24-hour service, they welcome you with open arms, and they never let you down. [DISH SLAMMING] [BOOK SLAMMING] -Pick it up. -I meant the book. RICHARD: Oh uh may I see you in my study at your leisure? -This is nice isn't it? Just a hint of orange. -Michael my ex-husband used to pour it on desserts and light it, flambe. -What did he do? -He was an actor. He dropped out of Harvard junior year, and joined a theater group in Cambridge. -Risky profession. EMMA: Yes I worked part-time as a stenographer. We were able to buy a little vacation house in New Hampshire. I got that in the settlement. He became involved with a director, a man. He was bisexual. -Oh my I'm sorry must have been very difficult for you. -Well, I had for a while, an urge to become a statistic, you know, just find a bridge and jump into the Charles. -How did you meet him? EMMA: I was 19, I'd never been to a play. A friend took me to see Camino Real by Tennessee Williams. Michael played the part of Kilroy. He was very handsome and very talented. I had joined with the Etta Rosa, property girl and we were married a year later. -And there were no children? -Oh no. Things were too uncertain. -I would like to provide as much of a family, as sure as I can. We never had that. Because Wendell's mother was mentally ill for many years. She died when he was in graduate school and he left very angrily, spent two years hanging out in Berkley. -He appears to be rather hand full. RICHARD: He is indeed. Now I must ask your patience. I'm very bad at handling matters with the help, and there are a few things I must say, and they seem to be mandatory. I'd like it Understood that on no occasion are you to entertain men in this house and on no occasion are you to drink my liquor. Also, although uniforms aren't required I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't wear excessive amounts of jewelry or perfume. And I expect you to confine your social life to Thursdays, your day off. EMMA: Is there a curfew? -Of course not. Within reason. [CHUCKLE] -May I be excused? -Certainly. RICHARD: By the way Wendell's mother's old Volvo will be at your disposal. -What was Wendell's mother's name? -Mrs. Goddard Marion -My father who had never loved my mother -Buried her quickly in Grove Street Cemetery. -Laid her to rest in most indecent haste. RICHARD: I see your customer's makeup. -Dr. Goddard. -Please call me Richard. EMMA: What would you like for breakfast? -I uh think I'll skip it this morning, Emma. RICHARD: Emma, I went to bed last night very upset about our interview. You spoke most candidly and I didn't. I skirted the truth. Thank you. I skirted the truth because I wanted you to think well of me. The truth is I have failed my son, miserably. -(SYMPATHETICALLY) Oh. Well. RICHARD: We have a uh severe communication problem. Now these are the house keys and this is $200 for the market. You can take the Volvo and stock the larder. This is the car key. Transportation on the weekend might be a bit of a problem. Wendell has totalled so many cars, I refuse to buy him another one. However, he often travels up to Bennington, where he has a um a lady friend. Her name is Monica Donson and I don't take the Volvo because when my car, you see, is in use, uh well Jesus EMMA: Are you alright? RICHARD: Um Thank you. I also have a lady friend -Oh? -Yes in New York. Her name is Ariadne Marchand. I don't often travel there on the weekend. So the point is, you may not have the Volvo on the weekend, but you will have as compensation, peace and quiet, on the weekend. RICHARD: Is something the matter? RICHARD: Oh they don't match. Damn. [EMMA LAUGHING] RICHARD: Oh well Life's little indignities. But you know, I will actually look forward to coming home this evening. -Bye. EMMA: Bye. EMMA: My God. You'd think they were paupers. -Mercy confirmation dresses. [DOORBELL] WENDELL: That would be Lydia. [DOORBELL] EMMA: Hi. LYDIA: I always come to the front door. EMMA: Yes I see. -Mail goes to the back. EMMA: Come in. -I'm already in. EMMA: Lydia, we're practically sticking to this kitchen floor. Would you mind Starting in here? LYDIA: I don't bends. -You mean you don't do floors? -Ms. Riley, I didn't bend for Mrs. Goddard, who was 50 and feeble, and I don't bends for you. -I see. Then perhaps you wouldn't mind starting with the dining room windows. [EMMA HUMMING] WENDELL: See that you bends. EMMA: Yes. uh uh WENDELL: Uh hunger. I'd like two eggs over easy, piece of this ham, and a toasted english muffin with jam. -In your own palette Wendell, fat fucking chance. -A little cranky this morning. A little hot under the collar? Yes. I observed a trickle of sweat between your cheeky breasts. -Ho hum -Listen, just for the record, I don't know where you stand on race, but I love Lydia. So if you're one of those Boston Irish nigger baters you're gonna have to answer to me. -I'll ignore that. -You familiar with Virginia Wolfe? EMMA: No. Wendell, in the future, when you cook jam like that, would you mind putting foil under it? It gums up the machine. WENDELL: Somewhere in Virginia Wolfe, she refers to a shopgirl, she says she'd rather have the history of that shopgirl, than the hundred life of Napoleon, the 70th studied in Islamic conversion. -So? WENDELL: So I would like to have the history of the girl on our kitchen floor. It's very bad form to drink with form to drink with the spoon in the cup. You could lose an eye. [OVEN RINGS] WENDELL: Say, you're right. Wow that's going to be a bitch to clean. [BACK DOOR RINGING] LYDIA: I ain't getting that. -Hi. I'm Gracie Cesario, I'm the live-in next door. EMMA: Oh. Hi. -I just wanted to come say, welcome. EMMA: Oh think you. Come on in. -OK. GRACIE: Yeah, so I come from this big Italian family. Dinner was just square. And I got a son, Raymond he's 13. -You divorced? -No never married. I got pregnant in 12th grade -(SYMPATHETICALLY) Oh yeah. -Some high school quarterback called Dominick. Listen, I gotta say you're not what I expected. -What? -I mean you're young and white and- -Do you get Thursdays off? -Uh huh. -Me too. -Great. -I always go down to Pub Vincent on Waley Avenue. They've got good music and all you can eat for $3.95 Do you want to come? -Great. GRACIE: It's a date. -Yeah. WENDELL: You can't come in here, ever, it's not to be aired or cleaned. -Must need an occasional vacuum. WENDELL: It has no such need. I write poetry in here. My honorable father Dickie isn't allowed a glimpse and nor is Lydia. You'll find that I'm an acutely sensitive person frequently given to seizures. -That a warning or a pledge? -What are you doing Thursday? -Wendell, please. WENDELL: I heard the plumbing this morning when you were showering. A wonderful way to wake up thinking of a naked woman in a stall. Where did you get those eye? -My parents, Kevin and Peg. Truly you realize if we went out Thursday, your father would fire me on the spot. -Not at all, he wants to keep her for me. Relieves him of the responsibility. -Boy, I never imagined this would happen. -Neither did I, but can I be responsible because you inherited such gorgeous peepers. -Are you responsible for anything? Do you even attempt to behave responsibly? -That's it, Get out! -Wendell! Wendell! this is infantile. WENDELL: I'm going to Vermont. -To see Monica? WENDELL: Yes for my five monthly Monica fuck! -I will not allow you talk to me that way, Wendell. -Then don't fuck with me lady! -Wendell WENDELL: Tell the Dick he'll see me when he sees me! EMMA: Wendell! You can't do this I have to go shopping. EMMA: You're a self indulgent inconsiderate brat! [ENGINE STARTING] RICHARD: Did he say why he had to see Monica? -No I'm afraid I got angry with him. I felt his manner was a little too familiar. -I hope you mean verbally. -I suggested he was irresponsible and that sent him into a rage. -Well you're absolutely right, and you handled it superbly. Did Liam call by any chance? -Mm mm -Ariadne? EMMA: Not while I was here. -This Ms. Marchand work in New York? -God, this is good. No Ariadne doesn't have to work, she has private means. She occupies herself by making mobiles and seashells. She sells them out of a gallery in Soho. You'll enjoy of course. -Well I- -Nonsense I am not going to sit in that dining room alone. -Have you known Ms. Marchand long? RICHARD: Oh about four years actually. I But better tell you this before he does. I uh I met Ne before my wife died. It was the first moral lapse of my life. It was um well adultery. your face is determinedly blank, no judgment, no opinion? -Do you expect to be condemned? -Yes I suppose I do. -Do you remember the Bee Gees? -Uh no. -They had a hit song called, Stay Alive, it's all about survival. That's what Ms. Marchand must have been to you. -Exactly. Thank you. -It's Wendell. -Oh dear. WENDELL: I owe Emma an apology. I was rude to her this morning. I felt lousy all day. RICHARD: Well that's very nice but Emma had to shop with a cab so it's up to her, really. -Will you accept my apology? -I will -Good. Dad I was kind of wondering maybe I could take Emma out Thursday show her the town. RICHARD: You certainly may. I'm sure it would help her get her barrings. -Well I just wanted your permission. -You have it. -Bye. RICHARD: Good night. WENDELL: Now I will introduce you to 300 years of Puritan work ethic and rigorous repression. Lyman Beecher is here, father of Harriet Beecher Stowe. Samuel Morse's widow is over there, he had the code. Noah Webster is here, of Webster's dictionary, has his homestead in Loomis. They were trusted to discover Halley's Comet. -Charles Goodyear isn't he the guy who invented vulcanized rubber? -He is. My eternal gratitude Sir for a long and dependable tradition in condoms. -Tomb of The Unknown Mother. -She didn't really die of natural causes you know. She died at Silverhill Sanatorium. She died because she was a nuisance, because he had her committed. God, I loved her. He said they had a non-marriage. She said she wanted a divorce. He said, Jesus Christ Marion and what about Wendell? He stayed away after that, hiding in his study with his pressure solitude. She withdrew to her room. I didn't say much after that. When I did see him, I always wanted to look at him and say Hey man what about Wendell? When I moved onto campus, I couldn't visit her everyday. One day she let someone in, a Jehovah's Witness and all those goddamn religious magazines. Her name was Rayann Wilkes. Soon she and my mother became best friends. When my mother passed away she left $80,000 to the church. -Why did he have her committed? -Why don't you ask him since you're so palsey-walsey. I'll tell you one thing, I will never forgive him for what he did it was a score I intend to settle. -Settling scores is direct. -Well if you think you can come in here like Mary fucking Poppins and kiss everything better your head is squarely up your ass. -You're dragging all this crap around like a ball and chain and it makes you crippled and you love that -I do not. -You gotta get yourself a bullhorn so you can walk around town announcing my name is Wendell Wharton Goddard and I am miserable. WENDELL: Emma! Emma! Look I don't know why I came back from Berkeley. I know you are not going to believe me but I didn't wear this ball and chain out there and I don't wear either. -Are you in love with Monica? -I love no one but Lydia. However, you are finally most susceptible. -Oh Wendell get a grip. WENDELL: Emma um here, here are a couple poems for your perusal. -Oh no not me. -Come on take them. The will either reach you or they won't. It's all a poem can do for anybody. Just take your time. Read them when you can. RICHARD: Hello. -I wonder if I can have the crossword. -You most certainly may. -Here it is. -Thank you. RICHARD: Emma, you know you don't have to spend the evenings in your room. Please sit down. -Well I- RICHARD: Please. Two people civilize a room. My that's bright. -It's a hundred watts. Pang the expensive. RICHARD: I imagine that your life used to revolve around theater people. -Almost entirely. -So this must seem very conventional. Oh I'm quite content. I've had a bellyful of the unconventional. -How beautiful. -It's bone China. This is so thoughtful of you. Thank you. RICHARD: You're very welcome. Um How about today for a visit to the lab? -Well I'd be up for that. -And I promise not to be too predictable. Finish your egg and we'll go. RICHARD: You see all these categories, optical physics, plasma physics, particle physics, solid-state physics, they're all just methods of measure. We're trying to calculate the interactions between matter and energy, because that's all we have in the world, is matter and energy. -You certain of that? RICHARD: Absolutely. -What about us? RICHARD: Us? -Yeah, humans like you and me, and this piece of work over here. RICHARD: Oh yes right well we scientists learned early on, that human interactions are impossible to calculate so we left that up to the philosophers and the poets. You know there's something about you that requires, well it really demands, honesty and that tends to blur the delicate line between employer and employee. EMMA: Oh I hope you don't feel an obligation to entertain me. -An obligation? Not at all. I uh a desire perhaps. What I do feel now is a compulsion to share my thoughts, to be understood. I was brought up to be obedient. it's been the course of my life. My family thought poetry a fine hobby but a stupid profession. So I obeyed and they opted for physics, then my family summers near Marion's on Martha's Vineyard. Now Marion never dated. She was still a virgin at 25. I felt very sorry for her. So when I saw that our families selling a match I obeyed the game and then after Wendell was born her mind just deteriorates. She retreats inside herself. she took Wendell with her as an Alli and over the years they effectively shut me out. But you know the worst time? When Wendell ran away to Berkeley. I was middle aged, my life felt totally unorganized and everything was still unresolved between Wendell and me. But you know, if he hadn't come home I never would have placed that ad and you wouldn't be sitting here listening to me drone on. EMMA: And that's how Michael was my education. I sort of absorbed him by osmosis. That's a good word osmosis. He was an armiferous reader. -(SLURS) armiferous reader is another good word if you can say it. He was a hell of a knock wood. [WOOD KNOCKING] -That man came on just took the stage. -Oh I shouldn't. [EMMA CRYING] He wanted to have a baby very badly and so did I but I didn't dare because, you know, our problem. My this is certainly tasty, was it? -Woodbridge California. -Well I believe I'm over speaking myself. -Not at all. [EMMA LAUGHING] EMMA: I locked myself in the apartment for three days. My dad came and hollered at the door, are you dead Emma? I told my dad to bugger off and he replied, poor choice of words Em in the circumstance. -What are you doing? -I'm taking her up. -(SADLY) Oh will I be fired in the morning? -No you will not. -That's good. I'm so tired of being booted out of places. EMMA: Richard? Regarding the light Bill, Thomas Alvin Edison wanted us to use the hundred watters, more profit that way. -Go to sleep now. EMMA: Richard? RICHARD: Yes? -Isn't slumber a lovely word? -Lovely. Goodnight. [CLICKING] EMMA: Oh no no don't. Don't close the door all the way. RICHARD: Alright. WENDELL: Morning. Finished reading the poems yet? EMMA: Not yet. I'm terrified. -No worry, just take your time. Listen did you do something weird to the sheets? There's a giant welt down the middle of mine. -It's my mother's old trick. You cut them in two and flip them. That way you get the thin parts at the edges. -Some trick. -Oh what a night. I was almost flayed to death. What did you do to the sheets? It's Ambrosia what is it? EMMA: Apricots, prunes,and figs, with a stuffing. -You have the most extraordinary eyes. -Thanks. Taste? RICHARD: Please. Oh is that good. EMMA: Hi. Taste? [SCOFF] [DOOR SLAMS] EMMA: Richard. Why did Marion have to be committed? RICHARD: Well it was either Marion or all three of us. I was walking around like some kind of muted hound, and Wendell was seeing psychiatrists with alarming regularity. -Well Surely you considered divorce? RICHARD: No Goddards don't. Goddards keep their contracts. You know there's a need in all families to wear blinders, occasionally, but in extreme cases, the occasion becomes frequently, then frequently becomes the status quo. And you keep adjusting the level of tolerance, and things keep deteriorating, we finally realized that life is unbearable. -Ditto. RICHARD: WIth Michael? -Yes. But there's always a straw that breaks the camel's back. RICHARD: Always. After Wendell left for Yale, she never ventured out. She was living in a kind of lithium stupor, and she spent her days Bible thumping with Rayann Wilkes, but then one day she found a letter from me. She rolled her hair up in curlers, and painted her toenails. She put on a yellow robe and she walked that way barefoot down St. Moman to the physics building, she stunt into one of my lectures and started screaming obscenities. The doctors suggested Silverhill Sanatorium. She died a month later. RICHARD: Oh God this is good. Sunday home with a bird in the oven. -Wendell give me two poems. -He did? -He wants me to read them. -He does? -That's wonderful. It's a breakthrough. EMMA: I'm scared. I'm terrified, but I can't keep putting it off and putting it off. This will take three hours. May I take the Volvo? -Of course you can. EMMA: They're good. RICHARD: (WHISPERING) Oh yes! -I think. -So that's it, you liked them. EMMA: I liked them. I liked them very, very much. WENDELL: Why? EMMA: Because of what they convey about your feelings. WENDELL: Jesus, Emma that is so tepid. Look if you had to use one word to describe both poems what would it be? -I would have to think about that. -Don't think! React. -Coastal. -Coastal? EMMA: Yes, east and west. -Look you had a word in my mind and I didn't hit on it. -Hit on it? Jesus Christ, Emma you're not even in the fucking ballpark! How about poignant, or piffy, or searing, anything but fucking coastal! You will not take me seriously lady you are causing freakin' torment! EMMA: I believe you're suing for damages from the grave. WENDELL: You changed my life. EMMA: Bye. Have a good weekend. RICHARD: Thank you. [MUSIC PLAYING] EMMA: Oh you will. Just Marion and me. -Marion. [FOOT STEPS] [DOOR SLAM] [FOOT STEPS] RICHARD: Emma? I love you. I do. I know in my bones. It's a revelation. RICHARD: I remember watching other mothers nuzzling their babies and wondering why Marion didn't do that to Wendell. I never known how to compensate for that. -Richard. Richard. It's about time Marion's room is cleared. -I haven't the stomach for it. -Maybe the three of us could do it together. Maybe we could. -Terrible task. But I suppose that it has to be done. [DOORBELL RINGS] RICHARD: Who is that? -I don't know. -Who could it be? -Nobody. -Hi. -We got married -Excuse me. RICHARD: Wendell? are you all right? WENDELL: I'm fine. MONICA: I think Wendell's caught a little bug. RICHARD: What made you decide so suddenly? -Oh I'm not pregnant. WENDELL: We were tired of all the travelling and there's no privacy at the dorm. MONICA: And there's no need for me to be in school. And all I want to do is paint and talent can't be taught, I can paint anywhere. -She can paint in the sunroom. MONICA: Is the light good there? -Yes. RICHARD: You know kids, this just may be a mistake. I think we all need a nice rest, and a good honest evaluation in the morning. WENDELL: Listen Dick, I proposed, I found her father, I bought the rings, I've got a goddamn certificate this is not a fucking mistake. MONICA: Wendell your father has a right to ask a few questions. I'll paint, and we'll get part-time jobs, and paper work, and you won't have to worry about any extra mess, I mean I'll take charge of Wendell's room. -No one goes in my room. -Wendell don't be silly. [PHONE RINGING] RICHARD: Excuse me. -It might be my dad. -Wendell listen to me, are you in love with this girl? -What the fuck does that matter? -To thine own self be true. -I better get her bags upstairs. RICHARD (ON PHONE): But oh I think we can manage for a while. Yes yes she's right here hold on. - (ON PHONE): Hello. why do I have to go to the most expensive school in the country, when all I want to do is paint. But I don't need a degree. Did Rembrandt have a degree? Did Van Gogh? I ask you did Grandma Moses have a de- You know what you are? Your middle aged, middle class, Middle West, bushwazee. [CRYING] -What the hell is this? -She's crying. So I suggest that we all sit down and talk this through. -Look I tried to do the responsible thing, but the truth is I don't know what I've done. I'm so confused. -It's all right Wendell I think you've just caught a little bug. WENDELL: No. This is one of my seizures. Look I have to go and spend some time alone in my room. Maybe you could stay in mother's room. Shit, I think I'm going to have to go to the hospital. Look all I do know is that under any circumstances I cannot cohabit. -Wendell what's happened? WENDELL: Monica. Sit. Stay. Night. [WENDELL RUNNING] [MONICA CRYING] [EMMA CRYING] [BLOWS NOSE] [MONICA CRYING] EMMA: Wendell. [KNOCKS ON DOOR] -Wendell? [TYPEWRITER] -Wendell, lunchtime. [TYPEWRITER] MONICA: Wendell? Wendell. [TYPEWRITER] MONICA: Some people think my work is morbid. I really want it to sell. But I paint boats and barns. But what I'm obsessed with is nuclear Holocaust. See I want to paint the wasteland after they've pushed the buttons. I mean do you find them morbid? EMMA: Oh no not really. I would not say morbid. MONICA: See, what sells with certainty in all the arts is escapism, but I won't let them off the hook that easily. I want them to hear a kind of keening, from the souls of the dead. Can you hear it? RICHARD: Oh yes, quite so audibly. RICHARD: (WHISPERING) We have to call a shrink EMMA: (WHISPERING) No. There's no mystery to any of this he's done a dumb thing and he doesn't know how to save face. -Emma. -Yes? I want to make love to you. -We mustn't [SIGHS] -No. Night. [KISSES HAND] EMMA: Richard. Richard. We mustn't. We mustn't. -What are we supposed to do? Go to a motel? They're both asleep. -I am so- [EMMA GASPS] EMMA: Afraid. [FOOT STEPS] [KNOCKING ON DOOR] EMMA: Monica? WENDELL: No it's me Wendell. EMMA: You're talking. WENDELL: Yeah. I'm looking for dad, I can't find him anywhere. EMMA: I think he went down for a snack. WENDELL: I already looked there. OK thanks. WENDELL: Oh there you are. Um I want you to call Alex Bloom I need to get an annulment. RICHARD: Why on earth did you marry her? -Well, because I fell in love with Emma. -I am very sorry to hear that. -Well, I tried to tell her, but she refused to take me seriously, she thinks I'm infantile, but I'm not, I'm a grown man. RICHARD: No you're not. You are certifiably married and I think you're certifiably out of touch. Last weekend I fled Ne's apartment I had fallen in love with Emma, and the feeling is mutual. And when I got here, the feeling was confirmed. -Confirmed? -Consummated. -We were waiting to tell you. To ask for your blessing. You were with her just now, weren't you? -Yes. -You son of a bitch! You were paid to take care of this house not fuck my father! MONICA: Is Wendell talking? Wendell is it over? -Monica we have to get an annulment it's the only responsible thing to do. MONICA: (CRYING) You sleazy bastard! Why did you marry me and then fold up your fucking tent? -You're right, I'm a bastard. I'm no good. -(CRYING) I'm being treated like a goddamn leper. WENDELL: Monica I've got no confidence I can't even put a fucking poem in an envelope. I'm on an allowance for Christ's sake, do you really want to be married to that? MONICA: (CRYING) Yes. WENDELL: You need to go back to school and take some time and just try and heal. Sorry I have to go. [MONICA CRYING] MONICA: Thank you for liking my paintings. [PHONE RINGING] EMMA (ON PHONE): Hello WOMAN (ON PHONE): Ms. Riley? EMMA (ON PHONE): Yes? LYDIA (ON PHONE): This is Lydia. I got Wendell sleeping here just now on my hidey bed. Ms. Riley, he say you be in bed with Dr. G. EMMA (ON PHONE): Yes Lydia that's right. LYDIA (ON PHONE): Now you have to Come and get Wendell because I ain't sleeping on this barcalounger one more night hear? RICHARD: I've taken Monica back and I've called Alex Bloom to work on the annulment. I would like you to come home, but only if you stop this fancy about Emma. Understood? WENDELL: Yes. RICHARD: And I have to say, I could no longer abide your bolted door or your attitude. LYDIA: Now Dr. G., you go easy with they boy. RICHARD: Lydia, some things just must be said. Agreed? -I agree Lyd, thank you. RICHARD: Thanks. LYDIA: You're welcome Dr. G. -Well that's it. -I love your thrift, and I love your $1.99 mascara. | love you. RICHARD: Lets talk about the future. EMMA: OK. RICHARD: I would like us to be permanent. EMMA: So would I. -Now this may seem unreasonable, but your being shut up in the house all day disturbs me. Is there something that you'd like to do, some aspiration that got tabled along the way? EMMA: Maybe motherhood. I'd like to have a child. -I mean beyond the biological. -Richard, I've worked, and I've been married, and I think the most important thing in life is loving someone completely. -Are you really that traditional? -I am now. -Well then maybe you could join the lawn club. -I've move down to his room. -Oh my God. -I think I can accept him as he is. I mean him and his past. -I sense a fleeting doubt. -I'm not sure he can do the same for me, but if he can I think I would like to, well this is heavy. -What? You want to get married? -Yeah. But only if we can be a real partnership. We have to get Wendell settled first. Listen, let's go to church some time. -What? Like Catholic Church? -Yeah it's what we know. -Yeah all right. Oh Emma. WENDELL (ON PHONE): Partner and Harris Pediatricians. No mam they close at five, is it an emergency? Richard Cosgrove. four years old, ate three gold- gold fish, fish, three goldfish, Three fan-tailed goldfish. Wow, yes mam, right away. -So I'm going to be bringing home $300 a week. Figure I can use $100 for room and board. $50 for spending. I'd like to bank $150 I'd like to get my own car. -When are you going to start submitting? -What poems? -Yeah poems. -If you knew what was out there you wouldn't ask. -Isn't there in the act of writing a desire to have your voice heard? You are going to have to try again with the mailbox. -Well OK I can't. -No or you're saying you won't. -Wendell will have to start submitting. -May I read his poems? -I don't think so. -It would betray his trust. -You're fond of him aren't you? -Yes. But why did he write, my father who had never loved my mother, laid her to rest in most indecent haste. -Oh for Christ's sake, that's what he's writing? -What's it mean? -Obviously me. I'm going downstairs. -Why was Marion buried in haste? -You want a cup of tea? -Why was the haste indecent? RICHARD: It was terrible. Reprehensible. When she died, they called me at the office. Then I phoned Wendell at his dorm. Then I phoned the funeral home, and then I got on a train and I went to see Ne. -For how long? -Two days. -And Wendell was alone. -Why? Why? -I needed to cry. -I'm sure he did too. -We did it separately. That's the way we've lived. It was this big chasm between us. Marion. -Come here. -Nope. The funeral was at 1 o'clock. I was late. I didn't get off the train 'til 10 to, and when they lowered her into the ground, there we stood on either side of the grave. Absolute strangers. And I went back to New York. I left him alone again. And he left for Berkeley. -Richard come here. -No RICHARD: Actually, laser is an acronym but it was almost called loser. Accurately, it's like oscillation by stimulated emission of radiation, loser. -He reminds me, a little, of what I've read about a young Robert Lowell. -And you like his stuff? -Very much. But he doesn't know where to begin. He really needs, you know, a connection with a professional. -However they changed it I think stupidly into light amplification by stimulated division of radiation. -You know I hate to impose but he would benefit tremendously from your opinion. -I'd be glad to read his sampling. Ask him to bring them over tomorrow. -It's been a thrill to speak with you. -My pleasure. -You were quite ensconced with the boss. -I went to work for Wendell with smashing results. -I think you look smashing. [KISSES] WENDELL: Oh Jesus Christ, what have you done? You got to phone him you got to make an excuse. EMMA: I won't. Select four or five right now and take them over to Martin Martin.

EMMA: He says, You have a very distinctive voice and he'll try to help. He's submitting the poems to three magazines with a letter of introduction. Here they are. He says there's no guarantee and you must be patient because you won't hear anything for at least a month. -Bucko now you're running a race. EMMA: Nothing but bills and flyers. EMMA: It's chilly tonight. -Yes brisk. What are those for? -Aroma, perfume the whole house. RICHARD: Nice little touches. EMMA: What are those for? -Something quite vital. Put another log on the fire. EMMA: Oh please don't, let's go to bed. Wendell will be home any moment. -I want to show you these. Please, come here. And no objections until I've finished my shpeal. BIL offers a B.L.S. Degree. It's a bachelor of liberal studies, and it is created for working people who want to augment their education. Ancient and Modern Lit., History of Civilization, I think it's ideal for you, cause you're out of the house and you have a focus to your life and we could convert Marion's bedroom to a study for you. -You're up late. -I'm advocating B.L.S. For Emma. -Why? -Keep in mind occupied. -Her mind is fine the way it is. -Goodnight -Richard, I'm tired. Think I'll turn in. -You'll think about this though, won't you? EMMA: Um maybe after my birthday or maybe when you get back from Washington. Goodnight. -Goodnight [SINGING HAPPY BIRTHDAY] -Emma Rowena Riley, happy birthday. -It's Waterford Crystal from Ireland. Ms. Timberman says it's very good stuff. -This must've broke the bank. This will be a brilliant memorable birthday, because you know what? The ring is somewhere in this house. -Wendell do your turkey. WENDELL: What turkey would that be? -The one you learned at that camp. -Oh yes. Happy to oblige. [IMMITATES TURKEY SOUNDS] [LAUGHTER] RICHARD: Emma. This is from me. -They're beautiful. Thank you Richard. They're so lustrous, so beautifully lustrous. RICHARD: Do want me to help you put them on? -Yes please. RICHARD: I surely hope it's a productive meeting, but, God, I hate grubbing for money at the Pentagon. -You're study is rearing to go Emma so please. Take another look at that B.L.S. Stuff will you? -I will. Godspeed. -You don't really want to go back to school day, do you? -I don't think I'd be happy. -Well kiddo, to thine own self be true. -If you're dad and I were legit, I'd like to have a baby. -He wouldn't. -Does he think he's too old? -He's already had his kid, Ahab's appointment is with me.

I'll open it when I get home. -(ON PHONE): Bye. -(ON PHONE): OK bye. WENDELL: They're going to do it. They're going to publish two $2.00 per line. I cannot believe that this is happening. -This is for you. -Thank you. -I don't even know how to celebrate. [KISSES] WENDELL: Thank you. EMMA: I'm fixing tea. Would you like some? -I'll tell him in the car. -OK. -I want you to be here when we get home. -Jesus Christ, Emma, How can I? -Please. RICHARD: God, I missed you. How's Wendell? -Richard. I have to leave. -Leave, where? -I've broken faith with you. I went to bed with Wendell. -He raped you? -No. -He must have. This is lunacy. EMMA: Please let's not hall insults. RICHARD: (YELLING) He's cuckolded his father, he's got me wearing horns for Christ's sakes. RICHARD: I should think that you would be your fucking knees, begging for mercy. RICHARD: How do you explain this? She attacked you? Big brawny Emma overwhelmed you? Or did you have one of your convenient seizures? WENDELL: I was very, very lonely. -Lonely? Try it for a quarter of a century buddy. Try it for three solid decades. -Why didn't you ever talk to me? -You were a boy. You were her child. -I was your child too. -And why in God's name are you talking about Marion? I come home to the vilest news of my life and you've got Marion on the brain. Loneliness. That's a feebling excuse. -You son of a bitch! You got on a train and you went to see Ne before mother was even fucking cold! I spent two days here alone. All I saw were the hours tick by. Two days alone here, man, all her fucking religious magazines, her curlers, her nail polish. I fucking despise you Dick. RICHARD: Listen to me you little twerp. For 20 years you've walked around this house like I goddamn specter faulting me somehow for your mother's condition. You thought me some kind of self-absorbed ineffectual man. Well you were fucking wrong buddy. I was out there functioning. I was putting on the tie, hiring the help, paying the bills, and putting the roof over your adult head. And you were never ever there for me. Now I know it was horrible terrible leaving you alone like that, but you were so hostile. And I was so desperately lonely. WENDELL: I asked people to come visit her. The women from the lawn club, Mrs. Silverman. [WENDELL CRYING] -Emma, Naomi Silverman comes over here, Marion assuming, she picks up her scissors and walks over and cuts slash in the hymn of Naomi's skirt. -(CRYING) Why? Why did you have to have her committed? [CRYING] -Because she was dangerous. She wanted to die Wendell, she has for many years. The only reason she got up in the morning was because of you. And most of the time, you were the only reason I had to get up. And then, when Emma came into our lives I thought, you know, now there's a chance, but not anymore. I swear, if I had a gun I'd shoot you. I want you out of my house. Take the Volvo don't ever come back. I want you out of my house. Please come with me. No. -What was he like? Was he good? -Richard. I won't do this. A letter came from Poetry Review, they accepted two poems. -Oh Jesus. -Please don't go to a hotel, just please stay with me. -I can't. -Oh. [RICHARD CRYING] RICHARD: Emma. I'd like to explain why I gave you the pearls. EMMA: Please don't. -I went to Sykes Levy to buy a ring, but when I got there, the cold panic came over me and the rings just blurred in their cases. And I waned to runaway in the Volvo. I remember as boy, being confused about what I believed in, and my father said, well what would you be prepared to die for? It seemed like such a crucial question, so I left Sykes Levy and went back to the office and I thought about that. What would I Richard Goddard be prepared to die for? The answer was Wendell. -Yes. -I do love you, but at that moment I didn't want anything resembling marriage. I'd see your face and reposed you were sad about Michael. I wondered if these moods would eventually require Lithium. I have done you a terrible injustice. Please don't go. -How can I stay? How? [PHONE RINGING] -(ON PHONE): Hello. WENDELL (ON PHONE): Are you all right? -(ON PHONE): Where are you? -(ON PHONE): I want to see you. -(ON PHONE): I'm afraid that's not possible. -Let me talk to him. RICHARD (ON PHONE: Congratulations. I'm proud of you Wendell. I'm very proud of you. I'll buy a dozen copies. Oh well. -(ON PHONE): I -(ON PHONE): Congratulations. [HANGS UP PHONE.] [DIAL TONE] -I'll sleep in Lenny's room. EMMA: Hi. -St. Mary's Church please. [EMMA PRAYING] EMMA: (PRAYING) Please let me be with child. [EMMA PRAYING] EMMA: (PRAYING) Please let me be with child. [EMMA PRAYING] EMMA: (PRAYING) Please let me be with child. -(ON PHONE): Hey dad, I changed my mind.
