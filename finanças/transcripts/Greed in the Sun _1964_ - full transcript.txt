GREED IN THE SUN Let's go, doctor. - Hi, Bumpkin. - Hi, Francois. Thanks! Hey, Marcel... - Hi, Bumpkin. Had a good trip? - Yeah but check the truck out, for some reason, it's pulling to the left. It's just 100,000 kms on the meter and sick of it! Me too and I still stand straight! What's up, Marec? Had a party? - Hi, Mitch. - Hi. We crossed a wedding ceremony. The baker is marrying his daughter. No shit? I thought she was still going to school! She won't anymore! What's new in El Zouar? There's never anything new in El Zouar... What are you staring at like this? - That's really something! - It's arrived yesterday night. - You know who's gonna drive it? - You? Neither you or me! "Experienced driver", that's written on our certificates and that means we're good for lousy shock absorbers, rooted engines and loose brakes! An experienced driver is better paid and able to handle a shitty truck. Anyway, I'd like to drive one of those once... On a day off. I'd go whoring with it! - If it's not us, who's gonna drive it? - It's discussed right now. Look at them: they're green with envy! Check that truck out. You don't know how lucky you are. I should ask you money to sit in it. For me, a truck is a just a truck. Lucky devil! You'll get to learn how it feels to be part of a family. With me, there's no boss or drivers. Just a big family! Here, there's never any problem nor any strike. No labor union! If a driver wants a leave or a raise, he just comes to see me. I listen to him and... I fire him! With the kind of people I employ, if you start tolerate whims, you won't last a single week. And I've been here for 25 years! - You understand what I mean? - Perfectly. Fine... You can go, professor. Fifteen minutes without anisette, you could passed out! - And there's no other doc around! - Goodbye, gentlemen. Professor Magard, a famous gynecologist in the 1925's. He delivered all the upper crust of Lyons. Children made him rich and children lost him. Little girls. Back in France, even if the bitch is 13, they call that corruption of a minor. Especially in Lyons... They're a bunch of fanatics. Let's get back to business. Got your papers? Steiner. John Steiner... It's pretty funny. What's so funny? - Got it for Christmas? - What? The little printer set! I've already seen pretty comical papers. Some almost genuine, some totally fake... But I've never seen any like this! But papers is a really personal matter... You leave tomorrow morning for Ouarza. At 6. Your mechanic is called Ali. He's waiting for you at the workshop. He's dumb, untruthful and he cheats when he plays cards... But he's a trail's veteran. He knows the south as well as I do. At 6. Don't forget to set your alarm clock. I never forget what I have to do. Steiner! Just a last word... At 2000 kms around, they call me the Beetroot, because of my diabetes. In my garage, especially when I'm here, it's better call me boss. It's even strongly advised. - We call him boss, they call me Ali. - Mitch-Mitch. Steiner. - Marec. - Rocco. So you're the lucky owner of that limo, congrats. It seems so. - Ever drove that kind of truck? - No. It's nothing of my concern, after all. Don't mind him, Mr Marec is of the jealous kind. His first love was a truck, his second love, a truck. Now he's trying to end an old scrappy affair. So, seeing all this youth, he started to picture things! Mitch, can you replace me? 'Cause he really tires me out. If the Beetroot asks me, tell him I'm having a shower. - See you tonight, at Zeze's. - What the fuck you want me to do at Zeze's. - Brand new! The pride of the house! Mr Steiner is probably gonna buy us a drink 'cause I'm sure is well educated! - And we do like well educated people! - Can education replace dough? Without cash credit, Africa would be long time dead! Your account is already waiting for you. Good evening, Mr Steiner! They call me Zeze. Newcomers are always welcome to my place. Sure thing. See? You're already quoted on the stock-exchange! - So, what are we drinking? - We have to wait for Marec. Bumpkin is always late. He's got a private life. A driver called Rodriguez crashed on a descent two years ago. Loose brakes. A 300 meters fall. They never get back what was left of Rodriguez. He's sleeping down there in his scrap. But his widow is sleeping with Bumpkin. Disconsolate women are one of Bumpkin's specialties! At least half a dozen widows! In Montelimar or Palerme... Mostly because he likes to wear clean shirts and well ironed trousers! - He's not a pimp, he's just obsessive! - Mitch-Mitch!... ...Tell him about Rodriguez's shoes. Like every Spaniards, Rodriguez cared for his feet. He was spending all his salary on them. He had at least 20 sets of shoes! He was taking a 8.5. - Guess what's Pumpkin is taking? - 8.5. - No. - 9.5. One must suffer to be elegant! Maybe but I wouldn't walk with a dead man shoes! I use to have a friend... Greetings, gentlemen! Sorry guys, I had a lot of things to deal with. You know what is it... Sure we understand you, Bumpkin! There's so much to do! In a household, after a long absence, there's always ordering to do. - What are you staring at? - Aren't your shoes oversized? Dunno, but you're gonna tell me if it's your size! - See what is it to talk nonsense? - But it's you who... I can't believe that! If that's the way it is... Don't you think Ali is taking some strange liberties? - That's also what I think. - But that's enough with that! Zeze, pours us six rounds to start with! Gentlemen... Ladies and gentlemen... Five! You can say what you want but Steiner doesn't sound very french! Weren't you born in Berlin or something? I'm born in Saltillo, but you've never heard of it. Never heard of Saltillo! Me?! Rocco... Rocco! Hear that? We've never been to Mexico and never heard of Saltillo! That's the funniest thing I heard tonight! I'll come back later. The Beetroot is a bitch! He should had give me the new truck. Or at least to Rocco. I'd maybe keep my mouth shut... He's almost as good as me. Isn't it, Rocco? Where's that prick? Isn't it, Rocco that you're almost as good at me? Depends on witch sector... Hey, Orlando, a new round for me. I have to make a call. I had an appointment... WET PAINT Oh, shit! Jesus Christ! Hey, Angele! Should I come to turn off the light myself? Gentlemen, the last round is for me! Not that I get bored but I have to be on the road at 6... Hey, pal, I think you're loaded enough, go have a rest. And you too. - Orlando! - You look tired. Want me to take you home? - Get your hands of me, young man!... Come on, kiddies, go to bed! Marec stays on his own and tells you to fuck off! You son of a bitch, can't you say sorry?! They're totally wasted! I better not reply, I'd hit the ceiling! Thank you, Mr Marec, I come down. Hello... Hello... Oh, yes, hold on. - Mr Castagliano, your call for Ouarza. - Just a moment. I'd like to speak with Mr Pelatreche. Oh, it's you! How are you? He left at 6 am precisely. A brand new 35 tons. I treat you well, right? Don't worry about the driver: he's as new as the truck. I hired him yesterday. Like this, he had no time to become vicious! The guy's gonna be there the day after tomorrow. Once he's there, you... No, the line is not cut. I call you back. What are you doing here? You, Steiner! What are you doing here? Where is the truck? - I'm speaking to you! - I don't know where is the truck. - I come to pick it up. - Be careful, Steiner, You're asking for a fucking slap! - I saw you leave this morning at 6. - If I had left, I won't be here now. And if I'm here, it's because you asked me to. - It's 10, no? - What do I care if it's 10! You signed this, no? COUNTERMAND: DEPARTURE TIME 10 AM - Can't you see it's not my writing? - How could I know? Where did you get this? - Rocco gave it to me. - Rocco?! - The Beetroot looks pissed off. - Obviously. A driver who got his truck stolen is good for only one thing: kick the bucket! And I'm gonna do what it takes for that: you'll never find an other job! Never! Neither here, nor in any other place. Africa is now too small for you! This scumbag of Rocco's gonna be landed in it with all the trucking companies. But so as you! And you, moron, you're going back to dates picking! Get the hell out of here! Don't let me see you again! You've done enough for today! That's true, I've been dumb enough to have my truck stolen. You fire me, it's fair. But you should have done it politely, big faggot! - What!? - Don't worry, it's nothing. I'm just gonna smash you up! Ahmed, Braim, Hussain! Get this bastard out of here, boys! And get at it with crow bars! Don't be afraid, he's thickheaded. I think the Beetroot... The boss wants you to leave. Guys like Rocco are never that hard to find. Depends on who's looking for them. Marec! Come. Denise, call me Tagmout. That's really a scumbag! I'm speaking of your friend, Rocco. - What has he done this time? - You know it perfectly. He's got away this morning with that new truck. I could complain and have the police bust him before he arrives to Salem. Any other boss would do that! But not me. My company is like a family. And the scores are to be settled between us. The drivers matters are to be settled between drivers. - You understand what I mean? - No. Tagmout is on the line. Say, have you seen Rocco? I'm not speaking about the truck... I know it's a beautiful truck! At what time? Thank you. Rocco just left Tagmout. He's on his way to Salem. What was I saying? That drivers matters are to be settled between drivers. Exact. Let's cut the sweet-talk: your friend Rocco is a wicked son of a bitch. But with a wheel in his hands, he's an ace. There's only one person who can catch him: you. Let's face it, Marec... A 10 million truck, plus the cargo... People are gonna know about it. It's very bad for the business. - Wasn't your truck insured? - Of course it is. - And the cargo? - Also. So what's your problem? You really don't want to understand! I'm telling you again that send the pigs to one of my driver is not my style. I have principles! You can trust me: even brand new, a fully loaded truck won't speed over than 35 km/hour. You jump on your truck and you bust that Rocco before noon tomorrow. With you, I'm pretty sure that Rocco don't stand a chance. What's inside the red truck? What does it mean?: "What's inside the red truck?" It means: "What's inside the red truck?" Cement sacs. You get the truck and the cargo back and you bring them to me. Including Rocco, if you want. He'll apologize and I'll forget about it. Once more, it's only for the principle. Don't answer now. But when you'll be back to the port, you'll see I'm not ungrateful. Let's cut the talk, we're not carpet dealers... Here's the best I can do: 5000 Frs. What do you say? Let's say 10 000. Then how much? Don't you think you're taking advantage of the situation? Okay for 20,000 but it's my final offer! Ali! Fill it up! Food and water for two days. And make it snappy, we're off in half an hour. Sure thing, Mr Marec. Are you out of your mind? What's with you? - I'd like to be part of the trip. - Excuse-me but we're full. Get off the way, I'm in a hurry: I have potatoes to deliver. - We could deliver these potatoes together. - I didn't think about it. - So I get off, right? - No, you stay here. We're loosing time, Marec. We could take turns, drive all night... And if we find Rocco, being two wouldn't go amiss. - We're already two. - You mean him? If you have to catch Rocco and if you guys have to talk, I don't want to be on your way. I know you and I know Rocco, you have sometimes some very loud talking. Okay, get lost. Tell the Beetroot that... Tell him what you want, who gives a shit. Get in. Don't you think your friend Rocco may be waiting for you with a gun? That kind of things happen. Jeez, you don't miss anything, do you? For this kind of things, yes. - You feel ok? - Terrific! - Me too, you know. - I can understand why. Salem: the desert's flower in its green setting! You'll give a call to your big shot to tell him everything is ok. I have to call him only if it turns bad. We'll be rich in two days, Rocco. We'll be happy. Where did they teach you that money can buy happiness? Did you had a secular education? - Fill it up. - What do I do? You wait for me. - Hello, my good men! - You again? You don't take any day off anymore? I spare no effort, I want my boss to be pleased! I don't know if I have anything warm. I check what's left in the kitchen. Forget it. Just give me four sandwiches and four beers. What's up? You're in a rush? No, it's Kenouche. If Rocco came by? He's right before me. Just tell me if he's alone. I'm putting you through... Your buddy. No, I don't want want to speak with him, just tell me if he's alone. You son of a bitch, are you out of your mind? - Is that you, Bumpkin? - Yes, it's me, Bumpkin! You sound funny! Isn't your voice changing? What?! Are you going to cut that mess? Listen Rocco, you put yourself into a dirty muddle, but I can still help you out. No, I'm not joking! And neither does Steiner! Yes, he's with me. Absolutely! What? Yes, I'm tailing you and I'm even paid for that! So listen, here's the deal... You wait for me in Salem and we have a talk. We go for each other or we find an understanding... ...But in both cases, we spare time and tiredness. Do we agree on this? What? Of course no! Listen to me, Bumpkin. I assure you nobody's mad at you. You stole a truck, it's not a crime. Everyone has to do something stupid once in his life. - I don't want to give you a lecture... - You fucking two-faced bastard! Don't shout. Don't swear. It won't help you. I was saying: I don't want to give you a lecture but I don't want to see you come back handcuffed. So listen to me: once in Salem, ask the Deaf to cook a couscous for you then turn around and get back home. Do it for the pals, Bumpkin! We'd all feel sorry if you end up in the slammer! Fuck you! Hear me? Fuck you! Hi, Deaf. I would had prefer that you don't hear that... But anyway, we know you're a discreet man. Marec has done something stupid? Let's talk about something else. We're out of veal, I made them with ham. You want your beers inside a thermos? No, it's ok. Here's the money... It's ok, I take it... Why Bumpkin did that? He was a reliable guy. You know, when passion comes into something, nobody remains reliable. Passion? What passion? I thought Rodriguez's widow was just a snack. - But now, Bumpkin eats on the menu. - What type? A Berber girl . A Yankee. Strong. The basketball champion's type. No? It can't be true! - I can't believe it. How did that happen? - Who knows? They met at Zeze's. It was love at first sight. He could had least come upon a good one, but he's dishonest on top of that. Wow, your mechanic's hot! Don't you team with Said anymore? After what happen to Bumpkin, I won't take a chance! Hey... About what we said... The Beetroot must be steamed up! Awful!... Since we're speaking of him, I guess you want to keep him as a client. Of course! Why are you saying that? Because, if Marec and his lady come by, it won't be appreciated if you give them gasoline. Don't worry, my pumps are dried up! - Hey, Mr. Can you take me to Cherfa? - I don't go to Cherfa! Slow down. Slow down! I tell you to slow down, we arrive to a sharp curve. Slow down, for Christ's sake! Do something like this with the tractor trailer and that's the end of us! If we had the tractor trailer, we wouldn't be chasing it now. - Here's the missus who comes to shop! - Hi, guys! - Hi, Bumpkin. - Hi, Deaf. How are you? - So, what's up? - Don't tell me you're not in the know. You know, me and the gossips... And I've got some disabilities. Sorry, I forgot about it. - A beer. Not iced. - One for me too. Say, one can have bad ears without being short-sighted. Was Rocco alone when he came by? No... He was with a chick. That's funny, everybody seems to move around with his chick, now. A girl on his truck, on top of that. What kind? A whore from around here? - I never saw her before. - We don't know all the whores, do we? Some come from far away. - I heard the Yanks are great. If you like stringbeans! Say, Marec. They always joke like this or they really want to pick up a fight? I swear I don't understand... Hey Kenouche, go fill my tank. By the way, speaking of gasoline... It's annoying but... A military convoy just came by and emptied all my pumps. What's these fibs, now? I assure you it's true. Marec, come have a look. JUST MARRIED Halibi. Yes? What's with you? I was thinking about the Deaf. About the clout he's gonna get! Do you feel better? Stop it, Mr Marec! The tank is filled. See? Everything can be settled with a bit of good will! By the way... For the bill... As that's the military who emptied your pumps, send it to the army department. Don't you think you're going too far? I'm not a financial company. I'm a grocer, gasoline seller, beverage seller. Watch out! If I step in again, you won't be anything of that anymore! Ok, it's fine! But let me tell you that you're nothing close to funny. I've been waiting for two days, can you take me? - Where to? - Cherfa. I've nothing to do in Cherfa! - Can you ask him to take me to Cherfa? - We're not going to Cherfa! Hop in. We'll drop you off at the crossroad before the border. Hurry up. Hurry up, I said! What a jerk! So what? We just got stuck into the fech-fech. We? I love that "we"? A stain as big as the Tanganyika and you didn't see it! What did you get instead of a brain? Quark? You want me to have an X-ray or we get the shovels? And you, are you waiting for us to carry you? Give me the shovels. Good Lord! Here is the line's champion! The ace driver! Excuse-me sir if I'm inquisitive, but aren't you stuck in the sand? You want me to tell you? You're not even funny! Come on, boy, let the shovels dig! One must help his neighbor! We have to face it: that's what happens when you get old. Just pretend you haven't seen anything. Bumpkin is getting short-sighted so he has a hard time staying on the trail. Sometimes we find him in Mozambique, sometimes on road 66 and sometimes, like today, in the fech-fech! So we tow him back to avoid him loosing his job. - Old people do have to eat too! - Are you done with that?! Yeah, sure. I think 20 shovels of sand a minute is a pretty good rhythm. Ok? - We can do better. - Let's say 25. If granps doesn't have a heart attack! By the way, why did you give such a treatment to the Deaf? He looked pissed off. He also told me this little scum of Rocco has a girl with him. Is that true? - He maybe picked her up on the roadside. - I don't know! It reminds me of my Finn girl... You know my story with the Finn girl? Yeah... But you don't and it's gonna kill you! Once, on the El Saoud trail, I bump into a petrol engineer with a conked out Land Rover. He had his chick with him. A tall blonde with dreamy eyes and the smile of a child. Obviously a slut! I can figure out this on the spot 'cause women are up my alley. Not like shoveling! I offer the engineer to take his lady to Agdid and to send him the tow truck. The wacko said "yes" and I hit the road with the babe... Isn't it, Said? - It's all true! - Yeah, it's true! It's also mighty interesting! - Are you gonna use your shovel?! - Just a sec, he wants to listen! - You want to listen, do you? - Yeah, yeah. As soon as we left, it won't be appreciated if you give them gasoline. You know the chick's sense of modesty sort of thing, because Said was getting an eyeful. At this moment, we arrived in the dunes area, so I asked her if she's already seen the gypsum flower. She said "no". So I stopped the truck and told her she'd see she most beautiful gypsum flowers she could find in Niger behind the dune in front of us. She did wanted to go have a look... Two hours later, Mitch-Mitch and the chick are in Igboulfri, drinking wine. Suddenly, the cuckold arrives, goes straight to his wife, without a word, and slaps her twice strongly enough to kill an ox. - Somebody told him? - The sand. Mitch is always overtalking and he told the guy to follow his tracks once towed away. So the little engineer followed the tracks to the dunes! That was no longer footsteps over there! It was as obvious as if they'd show him a bed! - How did that end up? - After the clout he gave to his chick, the guy wanted to keep acting tough but Mitch-Mitch stopped the first wallop and said the guy: - "You just shined, don't blow it now." - And the husband didn't reply? You know, when 260 pounds guys are speaking, 120 pounds guys are listening. Here you go! Now kids, if you want my opinion: don't speed too much and keep a better look on the road because I won't always be here! Here comes Cisco, you'll catch hell! Someone got stuck into the fech-fech? Don't tell me it's Marec, I won't believe it! He's looking for troubles, just pretend you heard nothing. Marec, Rocco gave me this for you. DROP IT, BUMPKIN - When did you see him? - About two hours ago. Well! I'm on my way. I'm not in Salem yet but I want to sleep at the Deaf's. Don't count on it. There's no more beds, no more furniture, no more nothing! - What? - Some hoods raided the place. He'll tell you about it. - Mitch, I let you pick up your metal sheets. - I you also want me do your shopping... I you go to Moussorah, you can save 120 kms. Forget about the past and go through Cherfa. What did he mean: "Forget about the past"? You'll tell me it's none of my business. Indeed, but it's no state secret either. Everybody knows about it here, so... 5 years ago in Cherfa, I had a small company, with three trucks. It was almost paid. It was called "La Saharienne des transports". I lost everything in one day. Poker? Ah, no! I should no tell you about that on the first place, if you add your chick stuff on top of it, I quit. The guy who gamble and lose everything, that's good for the movies. It's more funny than that. On a sunday, I left Cherfa with the jeep to go buy a distributor in Amara. I left at 6 am and I was back at 9 pm so I really get it in gear. But so as a bunch of local assholes who found the time to play the revolution. They change a right-wing dictator for a left-wing dictator. The foreign affairs minister and the chief of police jailed. Some folk celebrations also came along, like my trucks and my house burned down. And as nothing can hold back progress, they also requisitioned my jeep. All I had left was the distributor! That's it. Since then, they say the Republic is in charge again and the flamethrowers are now in different hands but I don't feel like going to check this out by myself. Papers. Thanks. Shit! You told me you won't get through Cherfa! Why did I listened your crap about the revolution? - So you change your mind? - Where's the fucking difference for you? If we didn't lose two hours because of you, I wouldn't be taking that shitty road! - If you're not happy, you can get off! - You should told me that before the border! Why? I didn't want to go through Cherfa but I told you why. If you also had reasons not to go, you should had tell me. It's not a truck, it's a confessional! Forget it and beat it! It's free today. Stop! What you want to do over there? It's a dead end. I know. But I'm surprised that you also know it. I thought you didn't know the place. I must had come around in an other life. Shit. The pigs on top of that. Come on, get down. Police check. Your papers. Your name is John Steiner? It's written. Yes, it's written. Seems that it was a close shave! Don't you think you could explain me? They were looking for a guy called Peter Frocht. I feel beat. - You told me we won't stop. - Yes, I did... But now I'm telling you I need a nap. In five or six kms, we'll be in the Djebel Hamzil. It climbs for 20 kms. 60 curves, 80 meters high sheers... Last year, three of our drivers did the fall. I don't want to follow them. With all the dough waiting for us, I don't want to be buried with the poor. I can drive if you want. I mean I can try. You know you're sweet? You brought me a 100 000 dollars job, you took care of everything, including me. But let me take care of the truck. Wake me up in two hours. - Wake me up if lights are showing up. - Ok. Listen! Listen. Listen what? I thought I heard something. That's because of the lack of sounds, we're making them. In the morning, some are hearing stones cracking, others are hearing organs. It really sounded like an engine. - It's just in your mind! - Do you want some coffee? We'll drink coffee when the cargo will be delivered and the dough cashed. Coffee with croissants and marmalade. We'll bath in she-ass milk and make love in colored sheets. But until then, we drive. Why aren't you nice with me anymore? Because I can't do two things at the same time. I was thinking about your explanation... About the cops. I can't conceal you I think it's fishy. Is it? That's too bad. By the way... This Peter Frocht... Did you happen to know him? Just a bit? Maybe... A bit. In the past. Why? Did you heard of him? No one can ignore a scum of that level. During the regime change in Cherfa, he tortured over 200 guys. A first grade scumbag, you can believe me. You're speaking like a military court. But it's far more simple than that. Money matters are always simple. I was keeping things under control for 1000 dollars a month and you're chasing Rocco for a stack of money. And you? Aren't you chasing him too? I am. But he's not my friend. Don't worry, it wouldn't change a thing if he was. He's right behind us. Son of a bitch. He went through Cherfa. Sit tight. Son of a bitch. Look. Are we gonna eat his dust for long? - Go ahead, there's plenty of space. - Cut it! That's just what he's waiting for. - Come on! - Fuck off! I think I forgot my blinker! Are you gonna shut your big mouth, now? - We'll have him when the road will get flat. - I want him now! I want to know how far this bastard can go. Sit tight. Bastard! Shit! Shit! Shit! - Hello, Rocco. - Hi, Angele. Is your father here? - He's in Moussarah. - And Abdou? He must be sleeping in the back. - I don't think there's a lot of solution. - Don't think and do it. I'll put a cap. It's gonna be nothing more than a cap. Hurry up. At what time did you leave the other morning? - Maybe at five or six, I forgot. - You forgot me too. You were supposed to take me to Blima and find me a job. - I'm sure I can be saleswoman. - No... Listen Angele, I'm gonna be mean but it's only to do you a favor. You've nothing to sell but yourself. And you won't even do it properly, you're too kind. I'm not the first one who said he'll take you to Blima. They all promised but nobody did it. - Do you know why? - Because you're all bastards. No. Because we like you and we don't want to see you end up in a whorehouse. Hurry up with the cap! What do you thing we were chasing? - What's inside Rocco's truck? - Cement. So you almost killed us to pinch some cement? Pinch? Who ever spoke about pinching anything? Ok, Marec. We've done all that only to tell your buddy off and take the cargo back to Blima. Exactly. And it's to get back to Blima that you carry all that money? You searched my pockets on top of that! A perfect teammate! Now listen to me. Either I go back to Blima or not, it's nothing of your concern. And I have something else to tell you. I was really wondering what's inside the truck. But now, I don't give a shit. I just want to catch him. Even if there's nothing in the truck. - Hey, it's still leaking! - What? If it keeps leaking, just put some oil, there's nothing else to do. That's gonna be fun! - What's wrong, Mr Marec? - Nothing. Hey, that's the dream team! I was just saying Said: "This poor Bumpkin, with his bad eyes, they'll soon have to put nests along the road." Otherwise he's gonna end up in the ravine! Wow! Nice job, guys! - You got a tow bar? - I've got everything you may need. Always. When you're ahead, I even have a spare engine with me! You won't surprised me anymore. This time, at least we don't have to shovel! I like it better when you operate on ground level. After last time, I thought the next one we'll have to call potholers! - Call what? - Don't mind that. With him, it's better waiting he exhaust himself without answering back. Just say a word and it's just like feeding the jukebox, it will never stop! - I've got no pressure, what are you doing? - If you think it's easy! - Rocco, do you think we'll make it? - We have to. Shit. You know what we're gonna do? We're gonna cut by the small road. Here's our road and here's Moussorah. And here's the other road. We call it the strap. 'Cause it's so dorky that no one wants to use it. Like this, if we break down, the two acrobats will pass us without seeing us. Lucky girl! You pick up a handsome guy without knowing he's also a brain! What's happening to you, Bumpkin? - Is your father here? - He's in Moussorah. But Abdou's here at least? Oh my gosh! That's the day! - This morning Rocco... - Rocco? - What does he had? - Crankcase trouble. - Bad? - It was still leaking when he left. So he got smashed up too. - You look pleased. - It wouldn't make me cry. Not bad. Even almost equally nice. One all. I have to weld. But he's gonna be nothing more than a weld... Ok, 50 francs for you if it's done in half an hour. - It's too short. - 100 francs. - I mean the time. - Manage with that, it has to be ready. - You have a moment? - No. Last friday, you promised me to knock at my door before to go. - You probably didn't knock harder. - I couldn't wake up everyone around. Answer me, Bumpkin. - Tell me the truth. - What? Am I a whore? You're still sleeping with everybody?... I mean with the buddies. - Yes. - Did any of them already gave you money? Oh, no! You see? You're our sweet Angele, that's all. My charity work is over. I'll have a bite to eat if you don't mind. And I'll maybe have a small nap after. I can reheat yesterday's paella if you want. There's only leftovers. So? Are you done soon? Almost, but it takes time. Marec, how many kms before the border? 300 and something. - So the game's up. - Not sure. This bastard is lucky from the beginning. But luck is always turning. I'm just asking the luck to be with me for one hour. The last one. No more. - Hey, Raymond! - Yeah? - How long ago did you pass Rocco? - I didn't pass Rocco. Shit. - Hi, Bumpkin. - Hi, Raymond. You didn't pass a red tractor trailer? No. Rocco has a tractor trailer now? - Hey, Ahmed looks kinda taller! - Don't mind that. - So, you've seen one or not? - I've seen nothing, buddy! - I've got some cool beer in my truck. - No, thanks. Ok, bye. Got it, this time? We're conned. Now that we are at the end of the line, what are we doing? Do we place an ad in the papers: "Trying to locate runaway thief, please help". Or we keep on chasing up to the Cape of Good Hope? Son of a bitch! If Raymond didn't see him that's because he wasn't there. It's all that simple. You really never give up. Shut up and listen. El Zouar. Moussorah. He exited El Zouar but didn't enter in Moussorah. That's the strap. The shittiest trail of all south. That's where Rocco is. Hear me? Hey, Bumpkin! Tell your buddy to drop his gun. Steiner! Are you deaf? What a bastard! I won't miss the next one. Drop your gun, Steiner. Hands on your necks. You too, Bumpkin. Now, lay down on the ground. Don't do anything stupid. You better know she's unskillful and could hurt you. No more gun? No knife? I hope you don't mind if I check. I warned you. Hi, Marec! Hi, Rocco. I didn't think you'll come to dig me out here. - You're smart, my man. - I don't look so right now. - Can I get off the ground? - Sure, Bumpkin, you can. - Can I smoke if Mrs doesn't mind? - Miss. My best friend Marec, my best fiancee Pepa. - Miss... - Don't move! Step back. Good boy. Are you gonna play cowboys like this for long? You're the one who's been playing the sheriff for two days. It really surprised me coming from you. I've known you in many games, but never on the police side. The police side? Your buddy's really stubborn. He thinks you're a bastard and don't understand you're on the thieves side. What does he mean? Did you guys followed me for 1500 kms to pinch my cargo? Don't tell me you had that kind of thoughts, Bumpkin? How funny it would be. I told you on the phone. We could had met in Salem and have a talk. A talk about what? Instead of causing troubles to each others, we could sort it out. We shared by amicable agreement. - You know you've got some nerve? - I don't have to complain. Do you have a piece of cloth? - Take care of him. - He can drop dead! Hey, your fiancee is affectionate! Did you heard what I said? Don't be misguided, guys. She looks independent like this - but she's eating in my hand! - Of course! Can I sit? By the way. Speaking of the way we want to look... You really took a strange one. Yesterday in the Djebel, I didn't like the way you almost send me to the ravine. Excuse me but I always thought there were some driving rules to respect. In a 100,000 dollars game, there's only one rule. A game of how much? What's inside the truck? Gold? Hashish? I don't know and I don't give a damn. - You're really not curious! - He's making a fool of us. I swear. All I know is that the guy waiting for the cargo across the border is gonna pay 100,000 dollars. So if it's gold, mustard or wild grasses, where's the difference? I deliver and I cash. I'm not here to appraise. Don't dream, Bumpkin! Even split in two, it's still a lot of money. - Why in two?! - Hey, don't move! Fuck you! Steiner, I'd like us to stay between... polite bastards. But why in two? Didn't I do my share of the job? Didn't we take turns on the wheel? Probably the first one you saw since the driving school. - You maybe want to see my driving license? - Cool it, guys. Anyway, we don't split. - You want to eat, honey? - Yes, darling. These gentlemen are gonna eat too. When you need working force, you have to feed it. One of you could maybe help me? - I'm hurt. - But this one isn't hurt, the fat slob. Hey... You said before you want us to stay polite. It's ok for me but your slut better speaks to me an other way! Hey, cool it. In deserted places, it's always better to stay friendly. It doesn't cost a dime, and it spares bullets. That's why you're gonna shut your big mouth... And you're gonna cook. I hope my dear friend that your painful leg didn't take away your appetite. - That's what I call manners. - You know where you can stick your manners? It's incredible how a guy can change. Remember, Rocco! In Tampico, in Mursi, in Carracas... We use to share everything. Risks, dough, girls... And you hit the road like a two-faced bastard, without a word. From you to me, is that fair? I can't say you're totally wrong. But I'm more right than you. Why's that? Because I hold the riffle. And let me be frank: the scores are rigged. What did we share for 15 years? Shitty roads, dust and hard blows. Never anything else. All we share in life is shitty things, never the money. Nobody. - You know you turned into a real scumbag? - No kidding? When you decided to chase me, did you remember of Tampico and Mursi? Anyway, it didn't stop you from running after the dough. You made your choice between friendship and money. - What the fuck you want? - Salt. Then ask for it. - Do you have a hard time? - It's ok. Can I ask you something? Like you said, you hold the riffle. And as long as you hold it... If you had the cargo, you'd flog it to whom, sucker? When something is valuable, there's always someone to buy it, sucker! Exact. So if I get the point, we're something like businessmen mislay into hauling. Exactly! Get on your feet, guys! We're gonna do some exercise. My truck has broken down and yours is working fine, so we're gonna shift the cargo. Listen Rocco. If I figure it right, once it's finished, you're gonna beat it with my truck. And I mean MY truck! So you better know something: from that point... Wherever you are, in Venezuela or in the french countryside, I'm gonna be looking for you. Even if it takes me years. And even if I have to spend all my money on it. I'm gonna be looking for you. I won't do anything else. Until I get you! And after? It's fun to hold a riffle, isn't it? The shitty thing is that after you can never put it away. Never. It's so fucking heavy! It's probably weapons. Gosh! Anvils are heavy too. There's plenty of heavy things. Once turned into money, it's gonna be lighter. I always have been wondering what I could do with a lot of money. I think I will keep horses. I have been feeling I'm gifted for siesta for 30 years. Cool Champagne, a recliner and a pond full of ducks. - Horses or ducks? - Ducks! Ducks are dumb but make you look smart. I'll maybe have a chauffeur too. And a brand new watch. Remember the ticker we've seen in Mexico, Bumpkin? - The one with the ruby winder. - It was sapphire. - And you honey? Any plans? - You're my plan. And you Bumpkin? With 100,000 dollars, what kind of silly things would you do? I don't answer to stupid questions. Say... - Your new watch is not on your wrist yet. - We give you a chance... You drop your gun, we just say we have broken down and we split in three shares. Shut up! Pepa, turn off the lamp. Well gentlemen, if the thinking is over, I would suggest you resume working. Come on, Bumpkin. I leave you all the supplies. Including the drinks. That's enough for three days. Once in Moussorah, I'll say I've seen a broken down truck. I'll be damned if you're still here tomorrow night. You must be kidding me! Are you really gonna do all that for us? Don't laugh, Bumpkin, but I have to thank you. When I spoke about shifting the cargo, I was afraid you refuse and force me to use the riffle. - It would have spoil your ducks breeding? - A bit, yes. There were no worries. I always know when I have to stop. Unlike you, unfortunately. - Farewell, Bumpkin. - See you soon, Rocco. - So that's all we do? - And what else do you want we do? You wouldn't have done anything anyway. You didn't take a single risk! You call volunteering to be a clay pigeon taking a risk? For me it's just mere stupidity. Where are you going? Where are you going? I go ice skating! Going that way, the road El Zouar/Moussorah is only two hours walking. - How can I walk two hours with my leg? - Then stay here, I don't give a shit! "Do you remember of Tampico? Do you remember of Mursi?" I thought you were about to hug! This bastard could have iced me, you wouldn't have even raise a finger! You would have keep talking of Mexico and the good old days! All your faggot stories... Wait for me! You'd like to see me die here, right? I regret you weren't in your house the day we burned it in Cherfa! Do you know who was with me on that day? The pig who asked for my papers the other night. He recognized me but I recognized him too. Peter Frocht made you run, isn't it? He probably kept you away from sleeping for nights and nights. Now he's right in front of you. What are you waiting for? Nothing. You're five years too late my poor Frocht. And I've seen you drop your gun. You threw it on the ground. Don't ever forget it. What do you mean? That you're finished. You're history. When I guy like you chicken out, even once, that's the end. You'll still be around for some time. We'll heard of you in some Mickey Mouse revolutions. And you'll do a few more small dirty things, just to have something to eat. Then you'll become a tramp. In Abidjan or somewhere. And one day, you'll get blasted for pinching a purse or a bottle of wine. I could have enjoy punching you but you don't worth it. What is it? I just called Abdallah. He asked where the truck is. He'll know it after he forks out. I want to cash the money here, not after crossing the border. A well civilized city, with nice policemen and nice informers. Just in case his henchmen get the idea to do me in. You're not very trusting. You hit the road in ten minutes and wait for me at the truck. And after, it's party time! Third service! Where's your scrap-heap? - Just pretend you don't know about it. - You're angry with your truck, do you? You stuck it in the sand, then you crashed it and now you lost it! - Fuck off! - And polite with that! An anisette. - What does he say? - Always the same thing. The Managa tribes in the south. Those son of bitches are doing some takeover again. The fascists hold the airport and the peacekeepers are probably on their way. Troubles! Tell me... In this city... Are the drivers going to the south taking passengers? To go where? Not to Abidjan. Not yet. Come on, ladies, please behave yourselves! So soon? You lost your riffle? You know you're gonna miss it? Can you get up by yourself or do I call a palanquin? I can. So you can maybe step out for a second? - Or do I have to carry you? - I can. Misses, if you would excuse-me... But I think it's gonna be longer that this gentleman thinks. Oh shit, not again! Can I have some privacy? Come on. Not that way... Go in the playground. Go, my boy. Close the door. Let's forget about this, ladies, and resume. Are you gone crazy? What's your problem? I warn you, you're really getting on my nerves. You still want to split 50/50? 50/50! Here. That's all is left from the truck. The registration papers! Here's your share. 2000 kms. Do you realize that? We've done 2000 kms for that. The greatest cuckolds marathon since the crusades! Pepa. My little angel, my sweet gypsum flower! You saw her. In love with her man. Devoted, ready to walk the streets. I entrust the truck to her and I go cash the money. Nobody in the meeting point. I go back to the truck: no more truck. No more Pepa. Everything vanished! - It can't be true! - I swear, Bumpkin! You've my word: she ran away! What a bitch! - See, if you had trusted me... - You'd rook me. Yes but I would have do it with style. So, Bumpkin? Weren't it worth the trip? When I think we almost fall out with each other! Madame Clemence! Send us the girls! Let's close the door and stay among friends! Bros as yesterday, buddies as always! Play the drum and let it know all the way to the deepest Africa!
