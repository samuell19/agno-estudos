(whooshing) (film reeling) (growling) (yelling, bat hitting) - [Idaho] Three weeks ago, this wouldn't have made any sense. (bat clings) But so much has happened since then. I suppose I should've expected things to end this way. (zombie growling) If we could just back up a few minutes. (zombie screeching) I said, if we could just back up a few minutes. (reversing audio) (cart rolling) That's me. About three minutes ago, and about three weeks after the shit really went down. Life was simpler then. I mean, look how cool I look. And yes, I am talking to myself. It helps my memory when I recite the rules outloud. You might say this book is my bible. It's told me everything I need to know. Like Rule #3: Strippers never tell the truth. (typewriter ding) - I'm Porshe, and I really like you. (club music) You're different from the others. - I'm Ferrari, and I'd like to give you something special in the Champagne Room. - I'm Mercedes, call me. 555-5555. - Sweet. (audio fast forwards) - [Idaho] I mean, on the surface, some of these rules don't appear to be very helpful... But, you have to read between the lines. (club music) Like Rule #2: Strippers are not prostitutes. (typewriter ding) (sloshing) I can't tell you how many people have trouble understanding that simple rule. (door squeaking) It's like this whole problem. It sounded great on paper. At first, it was like the ultimate fantasy come true. (cart wheels squeaking) Rumors that the women in our schools, offices, and churches were tearing their clothes off and dressing like sluts. The spectacle of the thing just overwhelmed us. The men, I mean. (muffled background music) (zombie growling) We wanted so hard to believe in something that we blocked out reality. Like Rule #6: No matter how much money you spend, and no matter what they say... (man screaming, zombie biting) There is NO SEX in the V.I.P. Room. (multiple customers screaming, club music) (ripping) Everything looks so sloppy. There was no organization, no resistance... If we were to have thought with our heads, instead of our dicks, this whole thing could have been avoided. Nobody could see what was going on until it was too late. They said it was mass hysteria. (splattering) I mean, did they think we were imagining all this? Getting naked was great! (package crinkling) But we didn't know our moms, and sisters would be turned into flesh-eating fantasy sex monsters that would treat us like food. (footsteps) Did you hear that? Rule #8: Strippers love heels. It's like a dead giveaway. It also makes them very slow. (zombies growling) (yelling) (bags crinkling) (heavy rock) (bags slam against wall) (Idaho screams) (bottles clinging) (zombie oofs) Rule #12: Always bring your A Game. (bat unsheathing) Strippers get hit on constantly. (yelling, bat hits) If you try to hit on strippers, and don't bring your A Game, they will eat you alive. (Idaho hits the ground) Welcome, to Stripperland. ("Stripperland" by Western Aerial) (zombie screeching) (police siren) (zombie groans) (zombies growling) (police siren) (zombie growling) (zombie growling) (party horn) (bone cracking) (zombies screeching, growling) (Hummer pulling up) (gun cocking) - [Frisco] I didn't bring any dollar bills, bitches. I guess this dance is gonna have to be on the house. (shotgun blasts) (Idaho grunting, zombies growling) - Hey! Help, a little help here. (zombie groaning, gunshot) (Idaho grunting) Holy crap, you sure showed up in time. I thought I was a goner. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. (running) Hey! I think we should probably get outta here. I think there are more coming. Did you hear me? - Yeah. - [Idaho] (running) Then... What are you doing? - Shoppin'. (soft background music) Can you bake? I said, can you bake? (smoke detector beeping) - [Woman] Hey, what's burning? - Kinda. - Crap. (box hits the floor) Crap. (other box hits) Complete crap. (third box hits) (hitting boxes) All these premade mixes are complete shit. Man I need something... (hitting boxes) From scratch. None of this premade bullshit. Everywhere I go, no eggs, bad milk, and only flour. Fuckin' doo. (Idaho hits shelf) (mumbling) Nobody can cook. (continues mumbling) (Hummer accelerates) You look pathetic, get in. (heavy metal) (radio static) - So, not from around here. - Mm. - Back east, down south? - San Francisco. - Oh, nice! I was there once. My parents took me, nice place. Bridge, Alcatraz... It's amazing anybody ever escaped from there. Sharks! By the way, I'm- - Look, I don't have any use for any names... In this mess you either are are you aren't. And chances are we won't be for long. - Okay, well, what should we call each other? - You're Idaho. - Huh? Oh, like that movie! We call each other by where we came from? Cool... So you're San Fran, no, Frisco. Yeah, Frisco... But I need a different name. - You're Idaho. - Well, yeah, but I'm not even from- - Idaho! (Hummer accelerating) - [Idaho] You don't talk much, do you? - Nope. - Would you like to know more about me? What else is there to talk about? (punching, splattering) (Frisco sighs) You wouldn't believe this but, I lived with my dad and stepmom. They left me pretty much alone. (punk rock playing through the computer) (messenger beeps) (typing, messenger beeping) (clicking, typing) (clicking, scoffing) (clicking, zombie growling) (messenger beeps) (Dad yelling, glass breaking in the background) (clicking) - This is Susie Borman, coming to you live. Women are returning in various states of undress, and seeking male victims. Widespread reports from malls and churches, and office buildings report that women are inexplicably tearing off their clothes, and seeking screaming acts of murder. Officials are urging citizens, men particularly, stay indoors, and avoid all women in a state of undress. It may seem that they have desire for sex, but really they just want to eat you. (messenger beeps) I see terrible things, stay indoors! Oh, my God! (zombies groaning) - [Idaho] This is all BS. (typing) Alright, it's porn time. (clicking) (typing, struggle escalates in the background) (clearing throat) (clicking) - [Actress] Oh, man, it's so hot. (opening popsicle wrapper) (door knock) - Go away! (door knocking, grunts) Go away! I'm working. (door knocking) Fuck, alright! I'm coming to get you Barbara. (opening door) (Barbara grunts) Uh, hey Barbara. (Barbara growls) I'm just gonna... Go now... (slams door) - Oh, God. - Dad! - Goddamnit. - Dad, what happened? We have to get you to a hospital. - (grunting) Ah, c'mon, it's not so bad. - Dad, what did she do to you? - It's not her fault, she's a good woman. It's the virus, a jerk of a virus. It's taken over. (Barbara growling) Look, son, I know I haven't been there for you always. I haven't lead a great life. I know I missed your soccer games, and school plays, and you enjoyed those school plays, and that's why I thought you were a fag, but (grunting and mumbling). Ah, major pain, major pain, oh. (panting, Barbara growling) I was trying to make a good life. A life for you and Barbara, me. I got all those strip clubs, put 'em together, we almost went public, it was for you! And I had to get you a Beemer... The other kids have video games and try to keep up. (coughing) Oh, God. Damn it! (Barbara yelling) Take this, jumpin' Jesus on a pogo stick, that hurts. (groaning) Oh, it hurts. When everything's fucked, open that and use it. When everything is fucked, ya got it?! And remember, don't you forget, I love you. You remember, I-I love you. I love you! (groans) (door breaks open) (choking) Save yourself, son! Go! (Barbara growling) Run, save yourself! Bitch! (Barbara growling) Ah, hey, what are you doing? (Dad screaming in pain) (biting sounds, blood splattering) - And I've been running ever since. - So what's in it? - What? - The briefcase. - Oh... I don't know. I don't even have the combination. (Hummer accelerating) So, thanks for picking me up, back there. I have this book... Rule #9: Always fly with a Wingman. (typewriter ding) You help him, and he will help you. So, I'll be your Wingman. We can be partners! I never had a partner bef- - Look! We're not Wingmen, okay? We're not even partners. You're just some kid I picked up, okay? (sighing) Idaho, I'm sorry. - It's cool, I just thought since we're survivors, we'd have to stick together, but I understand how- - No, I'm sorry. - Oh! Oh, God. Dude, the window won't go down. - [Frisco] I locked it. - [Idaho] Oh, what did you eat, a skunk? Oh, God. Ugh, oh, God. (distant hip hop) Jesus. Jesus. - Do you hear that? - Wait, you hear that too? Oh, here's something. - (gasping) It's like we connected! (singsongy) We got a mighty convoy, trucking through the night, yeah! We got a mighty convoy, ain't she a beautiful sight? Convoy! - Not the fucking song in your fucking head, you idiot. Which is off-key, by the way. - [Idaho] You're off-key! - That's one! I'm talking about that. ("Club Life" by Double D feat.

(Hummer accelerating) (crickets chirping) - [Idaho] So, are you sure you know where you're going? - Fuck you. - What, I just asked. - And I said, fuck you. Sometimes when you insult people they say "Fuck you." - No, I was just wondering if you had a plan- - Oh, you had a thought, well imagine that. But your thought implies that I don't know what the fuck I'm doing, and instead of just pulling over to the side of the road to read a map or something, I'll just drive us out here in the middle of the night without a fuckin' idea where I'm going. Well thanks for joining the party, fuckwad. (crickets chirping) (door opening) - What is this place? - Shh. (door closes) - Is this where you were headed? Is this the plan? (paper and leaves crunching) - Balls, get your balls here. (zombies groaning) Tube steak, we got your tube steak. (zombies growling) (cocking gun, shotgun blast) (shotgun blast) - Yeah, that was awesome! Yeah!! - C'mon, let's eat. (door closes) (footsteps) (ominous music) Maybe some fresh orange juice?

(shotgun blast) Oh, you want some? You didn't want any of this. (shotgun blast) You don't want any of this. (shotgun blast) - [Idaho] God, this is a huge chainsaw. - [Frisco] Idaho, come in here and help me. I'm gonna cook something. - Kay, I'm coming! (slaps doorway) (crickets chirping) Ugh, that was amazing. God, I haven't eaten like that since- - It was okay. I was hopin' for somethin' a little better. - [Idaho] Okay, so, elephant in the room. Where are we going? I don't really care, it just seems like you have a plan. I don't really care what the plan is. I'll go anywhere, I'm with you. I mean, I'll go with you. I was just wondering. (fire crackling) - [Frisco] They say the shortest way to a man's heart is through his stomach. Ash just proved that was true. (sniffing) So to answer your question, cake. - Huh? You asked me where I was goin'? (as Idaho) What's the plan? That's the plan. (faint whispering) - Really, cake? Or brownies. Fuck, I'd even settle for a cupcake at this point. What about fruit pies, or Twinkies? - What? - Twinkies. - Well we wouldn't have to go very fucking far to find a Twinkie now, would we? Every corner mart's got Twinkies all over the place. It's not like they ever go bad. No, son, I'm talkin' about fresh, baked sunshine. My whole life was a warm, toasty, cinnamon, melty cream. A crispy, satin-y, crumble butter flake. A mint, moist, chocolate vanilla dream. A butterscotch-coated, honey-frosted, whipped love cake. I hate these cannibal bitches. (stairs creaking) And I always knew I would learn, if Ash could be here to teach me. - But you asked me if I knew how to bake. - [Frisco] You know, sometimes... In my sleep, I can smell the cookies. I wake up, and it just disappears. I could be driving and I swear I could smell fresh, baked apple pie in the distance. (sighing) Sometimes it's the only thing that- - What? What? - Nothin'. Why don't you just go to a bakery? - Fuck you. - What? That seems like the logical thing to do. You want a cupcake? Go to a bakery. - Oh, why didn't I think of that? Oh, I know, because I'm not some stupid fuckin' kid who thinks every idea that pops into his head, he's the first person who's ever had that idea. - Hurtful... Words hurt. (engine stalling) (running) (zombie growling) (woman screaming) (gun cocking, shotgun blast) (shotgun blast) - Do you know what the fuck's going on here? This is no Sunday school picnic. (cocks gun) - No! - [Idaho] Wait, they don't look like strippers! - No! - [Frisco] Are you a stripper? - [Virginia] No, I could never be a stripper. Besides, I can't dance for shit. - [Frisco] Maybe I should kill you just to be sure! - Dude, she said she can't dance. That means she's not a stripper. - [Frisco] So they say, but they did try to steal my truck. - Listen cowboy, relax. - How do I know they're not gonna turn into one of those things? - [West] We're okay, we're not infected! We're sorry, we didn't know we could trust you. - [Frisco] Oh, so I can trust you bitches now? Last time I saw a woman like you she was eating a man's brain. - That shouldn't have taken long. - [Idaho] Oh, snap. - [West] Look, we're not cannibal strippers, cocksucker. We broke down and we're trying to get outta here. - We're lost, and we just wanna get home. - Yeah, where's that? - Oregon, Portland near the coast. - Oregon? Nobody's trying to get to Oregon. Everyone's trying to get out of Oregon. - Ore-"gone," really? - You of all people should know, stripper boy, you gotta go through Portland to get to the coast. And Portland had more strippers per capita than any other city in the United States. It was full of strippers before the outbreak. - Well maybe it's not anymore. - No it's worse. Everything's a strip club now. They got this place called Stripper Alley. It's Ground fuckin' Zero. - Please, we just wanna get home. - [Frisco] No, I'm not goin', no matter what. It's like trying to go bear hunting with a leatherman. - (crying) Please! - We're trying to get there to see our Grandbo. - So wait, your what? - [West] Our grandma, we call her Grandbo. - What kinda name is that? - [West] Fuck these losers, we'll find another way. - N-n-n-no, it's just kind of a weird name, is all. - It'll be a lot stranger when she puts her size 10 shoe up her ass. - Whoa, I didn't mean anything by it, I- - Stupid and naïve. Your Gumby's probably infected and'll stick her wrinkled clam in your face if you get too close. - Grandbo. - [Frisco] Gumby, Gumbo, whatever, is she some kind of ancient army bag. - [West] Yes she is, and she's a lot of other things, too. - Yeah, a bowler, a lodge president, a champion baker... - [West] And our grandmother, so we're going to go see her one way or another. - [Frisco] Wait, what? - [West] Fuck off. - No, look, I'm sorry, this whole thing has just gotten me- Did you say champion baker? - [Virginia] Yeah, she's the best in the west. Ten times in 20 years. - She bakes. - [West] She also kicks ass at Scrabble. Fuck you. - [Virginia] Why does that matter? - [Idaho] He has a thing for baked goods. I dunno. Dude, let's help them. Dude, why are you being so difficult. They're uninfected girls. Uninfected girls! Don't fuck this up for me, man. Okay, just think of those hot, moist cookies coming out of the oven. If their Gumby is a champion baker- - [Virginia] If you get us there, I'll make sure you get so much- - What? - Well, more, cookies, pies, and cakes than you can even imagine. - [Frisco] I don't know, I can imagine a lot. - [Virginia] Well, if you get us there in one piece, you get it all. - I better. - You will. (rock music) (engine starts) (Hummer accelerates) - [Idaho] So... So what have you two been doing to survive? - Whatever we can. - Oh, good God. - So, what are your names? - Well he's Frisco. We have this thing where we're named after the state where we come from. - What state is Frisco, shouldn't he be Cali? - And I'm Idaho. - Potatoes, new turf. - Oh, I'm not really from... So, where are you from? - [West] Virginia, we're both from Virginia. - So much for your name game. - She's Virginia and then you're West. - What? - [Frisco] Shut up, West. (Hummer passing) - Soo, this is pretty weird, huh? It's like a Greek tragedy, you know? I mean, think about it. A world full of strippers. That's like every man's fantasy: a bunch of hot chicks in lingerie. I mean, I've talked to a lot of guys who would've thought this was perfect. But instead of having sex, they want to eat us. It's like, a "be careful what you wish for" thing, like a myth or a fable. It's a perversion of our perversions, you know? I mean, men see women in a certain- (heavy rock) (blade swipes, Idaho gargling) ...perversion of our perversions, you know? I mean men see woman in a certain way (Hummer accelerating). I guess I'm kind of like, a lesbian, because we both like the same kinds of things, or maybe I'm kind of like- - [Virginia] We should go to that mall. - [Frisco] Why would anyone wanna go to a mall at a time like this? Those things love the mall. The mall's the worst place you can go. - [West] It would be hard to secure, but there might be some advantages to it. It's also a target; those things love Hot Topic and Victoria's Secret. - I was just thinking we could get some stuff, like clothes, or- - It's too dangerous. - (groaning) Well, maybe we could get something to eat. You know, if they have a food court, maybe we could get some, I dunno, elephant ears, or something. We've been driving all night. (techno music) (zombies groaning) - [West] I think it'd be safer to go around back. - Agreed. I prefer rear entry. It looks locked. Even if this was a good idea, and I don't think it is, we can't get in. - [West] I can get us in, cowboy. (door closing) - [Idaho] (whistles once) Sweet ride. It needs a wash though. (lock picking) (alarm blares once) - Something I picked up in Israel. - [Frisco] Well, you're smarter than ya look, aren't ya, cookie? - Why thank you! And I'm not your cookie fucktard. (gun cocking) (door shuts) (zombies groaning, footsteps) (running) Sure you can handle that, cupcake? - Yeah, I think I'll be alright. It's Rule#12: Always bring your A Game, because strippers get hit on constantly. And you're not even listening to me. (footsteps) (soft background music) (footsteps) - [Frisco] This place is huge, I'm gonna check it out. - We should stay together. - They need to stay here, and you need to stay with them. (footsteps, zombies groaning) (soft background music) - [Idaho] So, why did you guys try to steal Frisco's truck? - [West] Because I don't know how to hotwire a car. - [Virginia] We tried, but they make it look so easy in the video games. - [Idaho] Yeah, Grand Theft Auto, all you have to do is (mumbling, West coughs). So, anyway what I was saying earlier, in the car, I'm not trying to be a macho jerk, it really is like a Greek tragedy. The Bocki were these women, who would tear men apart. They would get all horny- - Why can't you be more like your friend, he takes care of business and shuts his yap. - [Virginia] Why do you call them strippers? They're not strippers, they're monsters. (zombies groaning) - [Idaho] They are compelled to dance provocatively and dress in lingerie. I mean, the virus hits and they start looking for thongs and heels. I mean, it makes sense but I'm not sure who started it. - Shitballs like you started the name. But I heard the military started the problem. See, they were experimenting with some behavior-altering chemicals. They just thought they could dump it and it would go away. - [Soldier] Oh, crap! (liquid pouring out) - [West] But something happened. Soaked into the water supply. (burning) - Huh, that's not what I heard at all. I heard (sneezing) it started in a strip club. Yeah, it was a mutation of Mad Cow's Disease, caused by a mixture of germs and chemicals. (dubstep music) Rule #11: Never eat at a strip club. (crunching, typewriter dings) - What's with the rules? - Well, I, - Rule #55: You're an idiot. (typewriter ding) - [Virginia] I don't think anyone knows how it actually started, but i think it was spread through the money. Paper money isn't actually paper, it's partly cotton, and there's a lot of germs in it- (tapping) What do we do? Where's it coming from? - I'm ready. (unsheathing machete) - One, that's no stripper, unless she has three legs. (microphone feedback) - [Intercom voice] Food, army, money? No. When there's no room on the pole, the strippers will walk the earth. - [West] What? Who are you? (tapping) - I came from Indianapolis. I lost 100 that first night. (tapping) In the morning we formed tight groups. Then we'd hit at them, sometimes the stripper'd go away. And sometimes she wouldn't. You know, the thing about a stripper is she's got painted eyes, black eyes, like a doll's eye. And when they come at you, they don't seem to be living. Then they rip you to pieces. - Who's the pimp? (Maestro laughing) (electronic music) - Mmm. (footsteps, zombies groaning) - [Frisco] But why a mall, of all places? - [Maestro] Well I used to troll these malls for bitches, and then I'd turn 'em out. - [West] I never would've thought of that. - [Maestro] Well, that's why you're not in the game. I've been here over a week, and all the doors are locked, and it's perfectly safe. In fact, how did you guys get in here? (footsteps, zombies groaning) (alarm blares once) - [Maestro] My daddy was a pimp, my grandpappy was a pimp. I'm from a long line of pimps, but I'm the best, because I play the bitches like a symphony. That's why they call me Maestro. Shit, you think this is a costume? This is a way of life. - [Idaho] Cool... - [Maestro] But today, shit. All the bitches in the world shake their ass for free. And these bitches will kill you. Now, how's a motherfucker not supposed to get motherfuckin' cheese when the pussy be attackin.' So I've just been layin' here, L7 til the shit blows over. I figure that pussy'd be worth more anyway. - Look what I found. - [Idaho] Oh my God, I'm gonna eat the shit out of this. (footsteps, zombies groaning) (electronic music) - [Maestro] And I said, why go to an amusement park? That's like the stupidest idea ever. (soft background music) I mean, strippers are attracted to lights and blinky shit like that, you know? It's like, they're reminded of who they were, who they always wanted to be. I think that's why they're attracted to the poles on the carousels so much. - We were wondering if you wanted to come with us. - Oh, I don't think so, I'm a pimp, I'm a bad man. - [Idaho] No you're not. - [Maestro] Yes, I am. I'd turn these bitches out in a day. Well, you might take a little longer. But you, yeah, I could turn you out in a day. - [Virginia] (laughing) Please... - Eh, no, no, that's okay, I like you. - [Frisco] Take care, man. - [Maestro] Stay fit, bitches. - [West] Take it easy. (tapping) - Thanks for comin' bitches! (zombies groaning) (Maestro screams) - Guys... Guys? (running) (footsteps) (zombies feeding, splattering) (gun cocking) (frantic rock music) - We gotta go, there's no way to secure this position. (running) (zombies growling) No! They'll hear us. More will come. Watch this. (unsheathing machete) (door closing) (zombies growling) (kicking) (slicing) (kicking) (stabbing, sloshing) - Look out! (slamming against Hummer) (stabbing) (grunting) - What are you waiting for? (splattering) (Hummer accelerates) - God, you were so Sigourney Weaver in Aliens III. It was awesome! I don't know many girls that can fight like that. - [West] Grandbo taught us how to fight. Well, she taught me how to fight. Virginia never paid attention. (Virginia humming) After that, I went into the military. - Which one? Which branch? - (whispering) That's classified. (clicks tongue) - You know Frisco here's trained too. He's like a cage fighter. - No, I'm a self-taught ass-kicker. I just hate fucking strippers. When you're motivated it's easy. Hey, Ash, look what I got! (people screaming) (zombies growling) (in slow motion) Nooo! I made it this far because I don't care anymore. Ash meant everything to me. (braking hard, Virginia screams) - [Idaho] This is it, guys. Once we cross this line there's no turning back. We could die here tonight and no one would ever know. What would the ancient Confucius sages write about us if they could? Be this the last line- - Shut the fuck up! You are so fucking obnoxious. (as Idaho) I don't know how to stop talking. I-what? (Hummer accelerates) - It's beautiful. - I think so too, I love the trees, and the green, and the fresh air, I love it here! - It's incredible. - You know, I don't know many men that like such things. - Are you kidding? It's a paradise. (soft orchestral music) (kissing, moaning) There are strip clubs everywhere! Ah, I should've move to Oregon sooner. (kicking, Idaho screams) (Hummer accelerates) - Mm, (yawning) oh, where are we? - Still a ways away. - Look, I know you guys both think I'm a retard. And I'm sorry if it seems like I am. You know, all about the strippers... It's just, I don't know how to deal with regular girls. - No shit. - But I'm not trying to be a creep. I just don't know... It's hard to talk to regular girls. It's hard for me, at least. With strippers, there was a uniform, a protocol. They act a certain way. - Are you serious? (scoffs) - They act that way for your money, kid. - [Idaho] Okay, but at least I know what they want. I mean, maybe someone like you knows what women want, but how am I supposed to tell? - [Viriginia] Okay, this is fucked up. You group all strippers together, and then you group all women together. You're treating both groups like objects. - No, I-I wasn't... - And since strippers are women too, you're double-objecting them. Strippers take off their clothes for money, so what? You know, it takes two to make that work. Some guy sits there, and pays them to do that. He's paying her to pretend to be interested in him. Do you know how hard that is? Imagine pretending not to throw up, when an old guy sits there, who smells like piss and tobacco, and tells you he reminds you of his granddaughter. Or what about the greasy managers? Who angle you for sex, so you can get a better-paying shift. Or, imagine trying to be polite, to creepy guys who think you're in a relationship now, just because they saw your snatch- - Chill out! (Virginia sighs) It is what it is, but it isn't what you think it is, that's for sure. - Uh, wow. I had no idea. - So Virginia, how is it that you know the grind a stripper goes through? (radio crackling) - [Man on radio] Calling anyone on this frequency. If you can hear me, please listen carefully. We can give you safety, there is fresh food, a warm bed, and hot showers. - Oh, my God! Did you hear that? Hot showers! (radio crackling) - [Man on radio] Calling anyone on this frequency. - (hitting door) It's on repeat. It could be old, it sounds like a weak signal. - Well it must be close, let's check it out. - [Man on radio] Calling anyone on this frequency. If you can hear me, please listen carefully. We can give you safety, there is fresh food, a warm bed, and hot showers. Calling anyone on this frequency. (Hummer comes to a stop) If you can hear me, please listen carefully. (truck doors close, neon sign buzzing) - Fuckin' casino. Let's go. - We need to rest, and you know it. (zombies growling) - Company! (heavy rock) - [Frisco] Step right up, bitches. Step up to Sniffer's Row. (starts chainsaw) I got your pole right here. (laughing maniacally) (slicing, squishing) Hittin' stripper bitches! (splattering) Heads up! (slow motion growling) (speech drowned out by music) (limbs hitting the ground) (splattering) Take that, bitches! Hey, can you do the split? (zombie screaming, Idaho vomits) (limbs hitting the ground) (slow motion screaming) (slow motion maniacal laughter) (slow motion screaming) (maniacal laughter) Have at it, if you like. I'm only good at a few things, and zombie-killing is one of them. (footsteps) (arcade sounds) (monitors buzzing) - [Logan] What's this? Guests? I don't remember inviting any guests. Perhaps Mother did. That's right, finger my money, you young pup. (mysterious flute music) Nice girlies. Two women. Oh, goodie, guests. (chuckles) - Well, I think we're safe here. (thunder crashes) - Hello darkness, old friend. We, who were born in the crossfire hurricane, and are hungry like the wolves down due long in the midnight sea... They shall destroy the night. The night shall divide the day, and vengeance from the grave shall kill those that once were saved. Exit, light, enter... Night, I am he, as you are he, and we together shall stand up to be counted for what we are about to receive and we shall climb. Climb! Climb the stairway, to kiss the sky! Purple haze, purple haze, purple haze! (woman screaming) - [Idaho] Did they hump the girl? - Huh? - Did they hump her? - [Frisco] What? I don't know, that's not even... Look, the book is the important part of the story. - [West] I don't believe that at all, what a load of crap. - [Virginia] Me neither. - [West] Sexernomicon... I would have expected that from him. - [Frisco] Ah, whatever. It's better than military chemicals, bad food, or strippers without enough poles. Alright, let's deal. (mysterious music, monitors buzzing) - [Logan] Why don't you boys run, and fetch them here. - [Lackey] Yes, sir. (gasping) - (cringing) See you got two kings, that's no good. See, if we were in England, under English rules, that'd be awesome but this is Amurica. We got no kings, that fold. Ooh, two aces? Ooh, no bueno. Sorry boys. (arcade sounds) (ahhing) - [Virginia] It seems strange you guys have never played Poker before. - Well, I never saw the point, until now. - Well, this is kinda boring. - [West] Why don't we do something else? I never saw anyone that could use a chainsaw so well. - Thank you. - So, you ever counted? - Counted what? - Kills. - Yeah, actually I have. - Well? Eighty fucking one of those things, eighty fucking one. - Fuck you. - 84. (scoffing) - [Virginia] So why do you keep that book? I mean, I see you checking it every now and then, and I just thought you were trying to avoid strippers. - Only the infected ones. (chuckles) Well, since the thing happened it's been a great resource. I don't keep it to pick them up. It's more like, a set of behaviors, you know? A bunch of rules to live by. - Sure, if every woman was the same. - [Idaho] I'm not saying that, but, when the virus hits, they behave very similar. I mean, Frisco saved my ass, but before that, it was by the book. Guess it's a know-your-enemy type of thing. - Then you're gonna like what the doctor has to show you. Let's go. You, too, bitch, I ain't got all damn day. - So... I hear you have a thing for baked goods. How do you like my muffins? - Oh, I dunno, I haven't tried them yet. - Do you want to? - Are they as good as your grandma's? - [Lackey] Okay lovebirds, break it up! - [Frisco] You better watch where you point that thing, or I will take you down! - [Lackey] Shut the hell up, and let's get goin'. (Logan sipping from cup) - [Logan] Mm, oh my. (chain clanging) Uh! Lovely, lovely, lovely. (door opening) Welcome! Welcome to my humble abode! I'm terribly sorry about the mess. Had I known you were coming, I would have picked up. (fly buzzing, Logan mumbles) You must be thirsty? What do you drink? - [Virginia] What the hell is going on here? You have no right- - [Logan] (imitates buzzer) Wrong! I'm terribly sorry, but that's incorrect. You see, I have every right in the world. Around these parts, when folks come into a man's casino, eat his food, play with his money, kill his girlies, that gives him rights. Are you sure that I can't get you a drink? - [West] Who the hell are you, mister? - Doctor, I'm a doctor. Doctor Logan, at your cervix! Ha! I never get tired of that joke. - [Idaho] Wait a minute, Logan? I know you, you're that nutjob casino owner that killed those hookers a few years back. - The very same! How kind of you to remember. And to think, they put me in jail for a few, tiny murders. Took away my casino, separated me from my dear mother. But, what's that you always say, Mother? Life throws you a lemon, and you make... What, what is it? Speak up, Mother, I can't hear you. Life throws you a lemon and you make what?! - Lemon meringue pie? - No matter. My point is, my unfortunate incarceration was all for the best. In prison, I had a vision, and I dedicated myself to the science of retrowifery. - [West] Did he really just say "retrowifery?" - [Logan] And then the great outbreak led me to my destiny. Escaping from my bonds, I returned here, back to my casino, and my dear Mama, and dedicated myself to the study of this mysterious virus. All I needed were women like you, uninfected women. But I couldn't find them anywhere. But Mother said, be patient, sonny, didn't you, Mother? And of course, she was right, as always. And voila! Here you are, uninfected! Thank Heavens I have you, Mother, to lend me a helping hand. - [Virginia] Wait a minute, wait a minute. This is all fascinating, but I don't understand what it has to do with my sister and me. - Sisters? The two of you are sisters? Oh, Mommy, this will be fun. - [West] Listen, you crazy dirtbag. I'm gonna give you one chance. I demand- - [Logan] Oh, you're in a position to demand nothing! And once these gentlemen hear about my work with the virus, they'll be on my side. - [Frisco] What are you babbling about? - [Idaho] Are you looking for a cure? - A cure? No, a brave new world! Imagine, retrowifery. Turning back the clock in time, when our women were ladies in the parlor, and, cover your ears, Mother... Whores in the bedroom, heh? Imagine... Retrowifery, cooking for us, cleaning for us, ironing our shirts just the way we like them. Not too much starch... A cure, why would I want to find a cure? Don't you see, we've been given a second chance... (laughing) To reshape the world so that the women, dance to our tune... Instead of us dancing to theirs. - You're nuts! - Ha! Nuts am I? Do you call this, nuts?! Huh?! This is Day! (zombie growling) I taught her how to paint my fingernails. Okay, it's not the neatest job, and she did bite me. My point is, if I could teach her to do my manicure, then cooking me a nice, juicy steak be far behind? Ah! Rearranging my closets, helping me find the matches for my hosiery! Gentlemen, imagine, coming home, and finding your woman ready for you, down on all fours, scrubbing the kitchen floor. Is there anything... more intoxicating than that? Imagine quiet dinners for two, linen tablecloths, Mother's gold-ridden china, your wife, gazes adoringly at you as she silently strokes... your thigh. And you tell her about your long, hard, day at the casino, and then while she... tidies up the dishes, you go soak in a nice, hot tub. She comes in, and washes you with the antiseptic soap, and then she brings you into her bed, with its freshly-bleached sheets. While the sweet scent of her perfume, mixed with the magnificent aroma of cleaning products, drives you mad with desire. Imagine this, gentlemen, every night, 365 days a year. Doing the naughty with a women who never has a headache, never makes you beg for it, never laughs at you, never rejects you, never makes you choose between her and Mother?! - [West] Wait a minute, you're planning to infect us so we can starch your shirts? - [Logan] Surely you gentlemen see the genius of my brave, new world. (squeezing syringe) These girls of yours will become infected. All girls do, one way or another. (laughing) Don't you see? Don't you understand? Instead of killing us, they'll become our slaves, huh? And I'll teach them what it is to serve a man, from banging us to baking for us. - [Frisco] Did you just say baking? Because baking is a special skill. It takes years to master, you want these bitches to do it? (sighing) You really are insane. - [Logan] You're ranting about baking and I'm insane? Get rid of them. I want to study these specimens more closely. (squeezing syringe, door closes) Heh, bodies like strippers. (chuckling) Are you sure you're not infected already? (zombie growls, chain clanging) (Logan laughs) And you, my dear, you... truly are... (in a whisper) delicious. (zombie gasping frantically) You know, I don't have to infect you. If you could... See your way to embrace retrowifery, (squeezes syringe) without my special treatment. I so, so want to kiss you. But you are just too disgusting! (spits) (syringe shatters, zombie gasps) (zombie growls, gun clicks) Stay where you are, both of you! That's an order. - Yes, sir. (zombie growling) Fuck you, sir. (kicks gun, grunts) (Logan cries out, zombie feeding) (screaming in pain) - [Logan] Ow, Mommy, a boo-boo! You feminists! Time to die! (buzzer blaring, chains clanging) Kill, my pets, kill them! No, no! (Logan screaming) (zombies growling) - [West] Guess you haven't finished their training yet. (door kicks open) You're okay! - Of course. Two things I hate most. Strippers, and redneck goons, dumb and slow. - [Idaho] Are you okay? - We're fine, but I think he's had better days. (limbs ripping) - [Logan] Ladies! Don't forget your table manners. (screaming in pain, zombies growling) - Sorry, I'm late, boss, I picked up meat and it was rancid. Oh, I see I caught you at a bad time, I'm gonna go now. (zombies feeding, door closes) (Hummer accelerates) - [West] So, since you're avoiding the subject, do you think there's a chance for us? Don't give me that strong, silent shit. Do I think there's a chance for what? Did I think there was a chance that some virus would come along, and turn every woman into some freaky exhibitionist ghoul? Did I think there was a chance I'd be driving the last two supposedly non-stripper chicks into the center of this whole fucking apocolypse? Can't say I've been very good at predicting the future. Don't ask me about chances, I'm not much of a bettin' man. - [West] No, you're terrible, don't ever play Poker again. Not that I'm complaining, but, you suck! (laughing) - You see that? - Yeah. - [West] Looks like a big house, or something. - [Frisco] (scoffs) Tacky. - [West] Listen, if we're about to go into the middle of some stripper storm, I would like to be well-rested and fed. Just once, I would like to relax a bit. (downbeat rock music, door opens) (keypad beeping) (gate opening) - (patting Idaho) Wake up, sleepyheads. (door closes) (driving over gravel) (truck doors closing) - [Virginia] Oh, my, God. - [Idaho] Holy shit! I don't believe it! It's his house! - Who's house? - [Idaho] Guy Gibson! You know, the tough guy from TV that sells the barbeque? You know, "knock this from my hand!" - Who? - [Idaho] Oh, come on. Dude, where have you been? He's like the biggest star ever. We're gonna search the house; you two stay here. - Heh, he was so good in so many things! - Hunters from Space! - Super American Army Eagle? - He was the guy who like, came through the smoke, waving the flag. - Detective Grindstone! - [Virginia] I have the whole series. (as Guy Gibson) It's not how many punks ya kill, it's how many ya scare straight. (briefcase hitting floor) (crickets chirping, owl hooting) (mumbling) (footsteps) (clock ticking) (setting down gun) - [Frisco] Ooh. - [Virginia] My mom used to think he was so hot. I can't believe this is really his place! - What about the Mob Boss? (as Guy Gibson) You do me wrong... Why would you wanna do me wrong? - Classic. - So good. (growling) (footsteps, clock ticking) (clock strikes midnight, gun cocking) - [Virginia] Or how about Moon Smashers, where they're doing the lunar chasing without helmets. (ice clinging, Virginia laughing) Or how 'bout- - [Guy] What the fuck are you assholes doing in my house? Allow me to reiterate, my house. (singsongy) Assholes, what the fuck? - [Idaho] Mr. Gibson! - The one and only! - [Idaho] We are so sorry. We are your biggest fans! (Guy scoffs) - Yeah, right, kids your age don't even remember me. Well, you put the guns away, I am yesterday. Did you buy my last DVD? - [Virginia] Yes. They Call Me Guy, When Will They Call Me Sir? It was a lot more introspective than your other stuff. - Oh, well then by all means, feel free to jump all over my furniture. Nobody cares about some old action star anymore, huh? They threw me on the heap with Chuck and Charlie. Yeah! Ah. Now (grunting) they want pretty boys. You know, shaving your chest is no way to be a man. - Uh, sir? - [Guy] Sir? What is it, tea time? - Why are you dressed like a hooker? (Guy laughs, Idaho chuckles) - How'd you hook up with this guy? Obviously... (sighing) I dress this way, to blend in. - [Idaho] Sorry, what? - Oh, seriously, how did you two dim bulbs make it this far? Alright, I go into town dressed like this, and nobody bothers me. (Idaho laughs) Ahh, oh boy. (chuckles) You too would really like these dead strippers. They're almost as smart as you too are. Thousands of good men eaten, and somehow you survived, huh! Oh, you're not much better sweetheart, I mean seriously, who do you think you're fooling? What, did you just, climb right off the pole before all this happened? (Guy and Idaho laugh) - [Virginia] What do you mean? Oh, come on, usually I'm answering questions about dead strippers, not questioning live ones. Oh, and by the way, how does it feel to be the worst-dressed woman on the planet? (laughs) Okay, I'm kidding. (pats Virginia's leg) Actually, I'm glad you're here. - Really? - [Guy] Mhm. (Frisco playing piano) - This place has a generator and tons of food. Towels were damp in the bathroom. Somebody's been here recently. By the way, did you see the thread count on those? - You're right, someone has been here. But we're here now. Maybe we can finally relax a little. You know, I noticed a hot tub outside. It's got some jets, bubbles... (Virginia screams, piano closes) (running, gun cocking) (Idaho and Virginia laughing) - [Guy] And I said, slide, and he falls over an Italian! No one's gonna believe you can beat this guy! Alright, I said, besides, name me one successful boxing movie, right? (all laughing) (running) That's ol' Jean-Claude. And he's always doing the splits. I mean it's really kinda gross, you know what I mean? We're doing rehearsal one time, and I look over and he's got his leg up on the wall, like some kind of ballet dancer. (Virginia laughing) It's un-American, isn't it? (all laughing) And then Chuck, right, he thinks he's all this tough-guy. But you know what? He's afraid of the Bigfoot. - [Idaho and Virginia] What? - [Guy] I know! Seriously, he believes in this shit. (Idaho and Virginia laughing) So one night, we decide we're gonna play a joke on him. So I walk up to him and I- (running) (Guy growling) (shotgun blast) (Guy grunting) (Guy groaning) - What the hell? - [Idaho] Dude, it's Guy Gibson! - Who? (squishing, splattering) - [Idaho and Virginia] We are so, so sorry Mr. Gibson. - [Frisco] Who the hell is this guy? What the fuck is he wearing? (Guy coughs) (splattering, coughing) I would have liked to have killed in my last performance... (coughing, somber piano music) Instead, I die! (sighs) (crows calling) (shovel hitting) (birds chirping) - You sure that your Grandbo will bake me something? - She will. - Ash was the best. (sniffling) I miss him so much. (whispering) - [West] He's a fairy. - Well, I could've told you that. - Well how was I supposed to know? - I had no idea, I met him just before I met you guys. - [West] Whatever, it just explains a lot. I mean, I thought I was losing my touch. - Well, I can tell you that you aren't. (sets down glass) We should go. Stayin' here ain't gonna get any easier. - You're right. (no audible dialog) (Hummer accelerating) (yawning) (truck dashboard beeps) - Huh, fabulous. Good luck I'm not a bettin' man. Wake up, sleepyheads. (truck doors closing) Think I can turn 'em on inside. - I need to find a bathroom. (jiggling door knobs) Of course not. (sighs) Welcome to Oregon. (ominous music) (zombies groaning, growling) (limb hitting ground) (footsteps) - Dude, you're not gonna believe this. - Strip club? - Fuckin' aye. - Shut the door, shut the door! Get over here! (door closes) (footsteps, zombies groaning) (plastic packaging crinkling) - [Idaho] They think we're in the truck. (zombies groaning) Shit! Now they're in the truck. (items hitting the pavement) Shit, now they're throwing our stuff on the ground. (paddle hitting) - [Frisco] I found the controls before you came in, but... (door squeaking) - [West] Check it out, we got snacks. (bags crinkling) Shit, what do we do now? There's a horde of them out there. I don't even have my blades! What the fuck is it with this place? Gas station-strip clubs? You're gonna have to shoot them. - I don't- - [West] You don't have your gun? What the fuck is wrong with- - Hey, why don't you pull some throwing stars out of your ass? We don't have time to fight about this. We have to do something. - I have an idea. (fumbling through CDs) (microphone feedback, zombies groaning) Okay, here goes. (dance music) (soda tab popping) (glugging) Now, watch this. (setting can down) (offbeat beatboxing) ♪ Hey zombies look here ♪ We got nothing to fear ♪ As long as I'm rappin' ♪ We won't be crappin'? (zombies growl) (muffled rapping) ♪ Uh, 'cause these are words, and this is (muffled rapping) Ah, it was worth a try. - [Frisco] They're still too close. The music may have distracted them, but getting past them to fuel the truck, that's a whole other ball game. - Well, I could just dance past them. - [West] What? No! Even if that does work, how the hell are you going to gas up the truck without them knowing what you're doing? - What choice do we have? - Wait, you said you can't dance. They'll know. - Trust me. - [West] Hold on, you are not doing this. - Yes, I am. - Well then, you're not doing it alone. Look, someone has to dance while the other one pumps. - Okay, it's like this. You get down low. Sway from side to side. You feel the beat, kay? There you go. There you go, a little smoother. Kay, feel the beat. (zombies groaning) Alright, a little smoother. Kinda like this. - Okay. - [Virginia] Good, and you can start by touching your body, and running it down, keep moving. Keep moving. - [West] Mhm. - [Virginia] Good, good, and show a little more neck. Yeah, there you go. - [Frisco] Those fuckin' Oregon bitches, I fuckin' knew it. - [Virginia] Alright, keep moving. Keep moving, from side to side. - Uh-huh. - Don't stop, great. You got this. - [West] Alright. (jazz rock music) - [Virginia] Okay. I think we're ready. - [Idaho] Wow, for what? - [West] Idiot. - Let's do this. ("Tattoo" by 13 Cent Bob) (doorknob turning) (footsteps) (smacking) (zombies growling) - What are you waiting for!? (door closes) (gasoline spraying, splashing) - Dude, what is she doing? - You serious? C'mon... (truck horn blares) - Let's go! (lighter flicks) - Hold on! (lighter clanks, flame ignites) - Oh shit! (zombie groans, splatters) (Idaho yells in disgust) - [West] Oh, nice! - [Frisco] 82. (wiping blood) (flame igniting) (zombies groaning) (explosion) - [West] Let's see, that's 85.... 86, 87, (sucks teeth) ooh, 88! Ouch! - [Idaho] That was awesome, Virginia! You saved us back there! - [Frisco] My rainbow ass! Anything else you wanna tell us? - Okay, so I can dance. - Liar, liar, pants on fuckin' fire! In a world full of homicidal strippers and I'm chauffeuring one in the back seat. - [Idaho] Wait a minute, you're a stripper? (Hummer accelerating) So, anyway, what I was saying before, about strippers, wasn't about you. I mean, it was, but of course you're different, because you're not infected, but- (Frisco snaps) - Shut the fuck up. (bell tolling) (ominous music) (truck doors closing) - [Idaho] Stripper Alley. Never will you find a more wretched hive of sex and villany. - [Frisco] We must be careful. - [West] Sun's comin' up. The roar of the engine will be heard from all over the city anyway. Soon, they'll see us too. - Should we wait? - [Frisco] Nope. They can see us, we can see them. (Hummer accelerating) (truck dashboard beeps) (truck dashboard beeps) Fuck-a-doodle-dandy! - I thought that only happened in the movies. (truck door opens) (truck doors closing) - [Frisco] Somethin' bad happened here. - We gotta keep movin'. (truck doors closing) - Hoe! (fumbling, mumbling) Here you go. (unsheathing) - What am I supposed to do with these? - [Frisco] That's all we have left. - What are you gonna do with that? You need more weapons. - I'm not leaving this. - [Frisco] For you. (Frisco laughing) (gun cocking) (crickets chirping, dog barks in distance) - Let's do this. (footsteps) (coyote howling in distance, baby crying) (glass breaking) (heavy rock music) (zombie growling) (zombies growling, Idaho screaming) It's locked! - [Frisco] C'mon, c'mon! (footsteps) (shotgun blasts) (dinging) You! - You have got to be kidding me. - A pole in a sandwich shop? (zombie hissing) (hitting, splattering) Rule#11: Never eat at a strip club. (typewriter ding) - [Frisco] Shut up, turd burglar. We have to barricade this door more. Grab the chair! (chair sliding) (zombies groaning) (body hits floor) (unsheathing knives) (slicing, splattering) (heavy rock) (door opens) (zombie hissing) (hitting, stick lands on floor) - It's not working! (hits zombie with briefcase) (dinging) (gun cocking) (shotgun blasting) - 88! - 96. We gotta go! (shotgun blasting) (zombie growls) (shotgun blast) (Virginia shrieks, hits ground) - [West] Come on! (zombies growling) (West shrieking, hits ground) Keep going! - [Frisco] Quit falling down! (speech drowned out by music) (Idaho hits ground) Let's go! Careful! - [Idaho] Okay. (Frisco hits ground) In there! (cocks gun) (places knife block) - [Virginia] You wanna sit here in a strip club, are you serious? - You have any better ideas? At least, now we can lock and bolt the door. (heavy metal) (zombies growling) (shotgun blast) (knives slicing, shotgun blasting) (shotgun blasting) (knives slicing) (shotgun blasting) (knife block hitting) (shotgun blast) (reloading) - [West] We can't hold 'em off here. Get behind the counter! (stabbing, zombie choking) (slicing, splattering) - We can't keep this up much longer. I'm out of ammo, what do we do now? - I dunno, we need a plan. We need something; should I start dancing again? - Don't think that it'll help. - [Idaho] This is it, guys. - Everything is fucked! - Everything is fucked. - [Dad] Use it, use it when everything's- (cries out in pain) when everything is fucked! - [Idaho] Everything is not fucked. - [Virginia] What? - [Idaho] The briefcase! (slams briefcase on table) (ethereal choir music) (pops clasp) - [Frisco] Is it a gun? - A knife? - No, it's better. - What the hell? Rule#1: Strippers dance for tips, and tips alone. (hip hop music) (zombies growling) - Why won't they leave? - [Idaho] Rule #2: Strippers are all about the cash. (typewriter dings) They're never gonna get tired. - [Virginia] We're gonna have to make a run for it, Soon. - [Frisco] We won't get very far. - [Idaho] C'mon, guys. We have to try, we've come this far. Damn it, I mean it! We have to make a run for it while we can. - He's right, we have to try. - Okay, kid. We're in this together. - We go, on three. - [Virginia] Wait! Is it, we go one, two, three, and then go, or is it one, two, and then we go on three? - We go, on three. Ready? Alright, we go one... Two... Three! - [Grandbo] Get down! (orchestral brass music) - It's Grandbo! - [Grandbo] The kick-ass begins, when I finish my fine cigar. Done! (zombies growl) (machine gun fire) Forward! (mob yelling) (glass breaking) - [Old lady] Dance to this, you bitch! (slicing, splattering) - [Golf lady] That's not a rack, this is a rack! (hitting balls, splattering) - [Old lady with rolling pin] Batter up! (rolling pin hits zombie) - [Harriet] I've been saving this for a rainy day! (slicing) (hitting zombie, laughing) (zombie hissing) - [Man] One little titty, two little titty, three little titty... (explosion) (distant gunfire) (voice from walkie talkie) - Yes Trow, what do you got? (gunshots, muffled walkie talkie speech) Oh, good! We'll be done and mopped up in 10. Oh, man, I taught you guys well! Yeah, cool! (all three laughing) - [Frisco] Uh, miss... - Grandbo. - How'd you know how to find us? - [Grandbo] I knew my girls would make it. So I kept spotters out there on the road. We were a little late because Harriet was in the middle of bowling. - [Harriet] Yeah, my fault, sorry! - Plus, half of these geezers, well they can't even hear the alarm, and they have to get up. and put on their analgesic, and well, there's also some protective gear they have to bring. Kinda private. - [Idaho] But how did you survive? I heard there was no- - [Grandbo] Since we were by the coast, the virus was slow to get here. The cities, they were just chaos! All the young people, they just packed up, and left. Undisciplined, stupid. But, I trained my whole life as a sex weapon. So, you know, I know why we were losing. It was their bodies, their dancing. Everybody was so distracted they couldn't even think straight. - Dude, GILF. - What? - [Grandbo] So we expanded our perimeter to handle the whole town. We're takin' them out by the bunches. - [Idaho] GILF! - What the fuck is a GILF? (punches arm) - [Idaho] Ow! We're finished with those skanks, sir. We should be ready to roll in 15. - Good. The Earlybird Special is on me tonight then! (Grandbo and West laughing) (waves crashing, bright music) - [Idaho] If you would've told me a month ago, that strippers would be after me, and that I would've been running from them, and that I'd travel across the country with some kind of gay super-cowboy, or roll with a machete-wielding killing machine, and I'd get the girl... Well (chuckling) that couldn't even happen in a movie. (fork scraping, Frisco eating) - Grandbo, mm, I love you. - Aww, I'm so happy to hear that, princess. (oven dinging) Now, you make sure you try my pie. - Fine, alright. - [Grandbo] Now remember, you kids are safe here, we've swept the area. There is more than enough food, power, we've even reached some people on the shortwave. And soon, we're going to rebuild. - Great, great! Mm. (dog barking) - [Idaho] It's ironic, isn't it? - [Virginia] What? - [Idaho] I always wanted a stripper as a girlfriend, but I never met one, not one that would talk to me once the money ran out at least. - [Virginia] Well, you're very lucky. - [Idaho] I know, right? I found the last stripper on Earth, the last uninfected stripper on Earth, and I didn't even know she was a stripper. - Yep. - [Idaho] That makes me, the luckiest man alive. - [Virginia] Yeah, you know, it's gonna cost you. I don't come cheap. - Oh, I think I have something you might be interested in. General Washington.
