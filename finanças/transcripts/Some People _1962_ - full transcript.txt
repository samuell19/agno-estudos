Oh, right, you'll like them. - Yeah, okay, there's my bus, of course I'll see ya. (bus revving) (classic music) (door opens and closes) - Hi mum. - Hi. - Tea ready? - In a minute. - There's money. You forgot my sandwiches again? - Oh yeah, it's dad. - He talking again? - He's got one of his mood on. - Oh, well. Mike! (television playing) - Feet off the sofa, how many times (mumbles) - Turn that thing down. (mumbles) couldn't shoot his way out of a paper bag (mumbles) - Get back. (soft classic music) (radio playing) (motorbike revving) (motorbike revving) - Hello mate (mumbles) - Some biscuits? - Yeah I love it, cheers. - Any sign of Bill? (mumbles) (motorbike revving) - There boy, where you been? (motorbike revving) - Hello Bill. - Hey Bert. - Where you been then? - Oh, by the way you meet Terry. The final Terry, should be Terry. you met Johnny before, didn't you? - Yeah, I remember. - Well, what are we gonna do then? - Well, let's have a fag, eh, before we go? - That's not a bad idea. - You want a smoke, Terry? - No, I'm trying to give 'em up, thanks. - Have a biscuit then, eh? - Yeah thanks. - I thought you worked in a cigarette factory. - Oh, I do. Oh, it's not easy. All day, you know, thousands of fags all around. I smoke one, murder. - Yeah, hold onto the bike, will you Terry? - It's probably about smokin'. Yeah. Hey, you with that lot over there, Bill, or are you gonna come with us? (mumbles) - You have more chance of being struck by lightning. (mumbles) - You gonna come with us? (mumbles) - See ya. - Yeah Bill, I got an idea. - What's up? - There's a great park down at the docks. (mumbles) There's a great piano there (mumbles) - How about that Johnnie? Yeah go on. All right? - Yeah, okay. - You get on the port way and it's down on the left. - Yeah I know. - Okay. (motorbike revving) - I'm going on Johnnie's bike. - What's wrong with mine? - Nothing, it's more streamlined that's all. - Okay, if you want to get their last. (motorbike revving) (tires screeching) - You all right? - That was fun. (motorbike revving) - Can't let him get ahead, are you? - Bloody maniacs. (motorbike revving) (horn blows) (bell rings) - At the junction of Roman Wayne, they crossed the traffic lights when showing red. Later, they narrowly missed a serious accident with a lorry at the junction of Bridge Valley road. - Is there anything, any of you wish to add to that? - Yeah, well there's no warrant is there? You can't see the 30 sign until you're right on top of bend. - That's all you want to say. - Yeah. - Anything known? - There's nothing known against the defendants in this case, (mumbles) (mumbles) - I must say, I am getting a little tired of young jets like you're being continually brought before me on charges of this sort. You must realize that when you buy these powerful machines, you'll have in your hands, the most dangerous weapon. And I really do think it's monstrous that mere boys like you should be enabled to buy these things overly cheaply and easily. Has there one that has being bought on hire purchase? - Yes. - Now, it doesn't matter where the speed limit sign was placed. It was your plain duty to ride with proper care for the safety of other people. You were not only lucky not to kill yourselves. You were lucky not to kill it with someone else. You'll realize I hope that if anything more serious had occurred as a consequence about actions, you might all have been sent to prison. As it is you will been disqualified from driving for a period of 12 months. During which time, you must on never count, ride or drive any sort of vehicle on the road. Do you understand that? Also you will each pay a fine of 40 pounds. I hope this will be a lesson to you. Now, there's one last thing I'd like to say to you. Laws are made as much for your benefit as for other peoples. Think about that. (footstep) - So they all get. - 40 bloody quid. - No, it's not that it's the bloody license ain't it? So we'll got it wrote down I suppose. - Oh sure, they got a tiny set already for you they are. - Make a change from the timber yard. - So they all get! "I don't know what modern you is coming to, in my day." - You should have gotten done with (mumbles) (mumbles) - What's a 12, 13's - 156. - I always knew you'd do something dumb and stupid. Worrying mother's sick like that. (door closes) - [Narrator] 200 feet below the Caribbean is a magic word. (piano playing) - [Narrator] These are some, the big checks (mumbles) This little fellow wanted to make friends with Ingrid. (mumbles) (classical music) (mumbles) - Hello Bert. - Where off to? - Nowhere special. - How about you then? (car revving) - Not much to do or is there? - Hi Bert. - Hello Johnnie. Hey Bill. - Where you off to then? - Nowhere special. What about you? - Johnnie. (car revving) - Hello, you hungry? - What's going on mate? - Photographs. (mumbles) (mumbles) (laughs) (mumbles) - Watch this. (mumbles) - Shut up Bill! (yells) (mumbles) - Feeding time. - What's the matter we can look, can't we? (mumbles) (mumbles) - I'm very interested in the Russian history. - Do you want anything? (mumbles) - Cheers. (mumbles) - Bet he's got a girl in every port that one. (laughs) Look at this then. - Women. (mumbles) - Gosh, she couldn't fall flat on her face if she try, could she? - Old Jane must feel by the census bus boy, what about that? (mumbles) (mumbles) can ruin you, that's interesting. (mumbles) - Come on, let's go, this stuff is get me going. - Come on let's go. (mumbles) - How about a cup of coffee then? (mumbles) - Yeah, come on. - When I was a youth, you'd play with him. (mumbles) - That's so we could play ism play ping pong. (mumbles) (mumbles) - What did I tell you? - I hope this place doesn't change much. There is a dry look, come on. - It's locked ain't it. (mumbles) - Come on. (laughs) - Great. There we are. It's all yours ain't it? - Great. (mumbles) - You know no one's allowed to touch it. (mumbles) - Carry on then, can we? (instrumental music) - Wait! What's going on up there? - What's the matter with you? - I want none of your type in here. - What do you mean my type then? - What did I say? - What's he doing wrong? He was only playing a piano. - Yeah, that piano was locked. Now look at it. - What's the use of a piano if it's locked. - I've seen you before, haven't I? - Yeah! - I remember you're a trouble maker. Well, we can do without your assault. Now get out and take your pals with you. Another Teddy boys contaminating my boys and girls. - Who are you calling Teds? If you want that sort of trouble mate, I'll bring a gang of a proper Teds up and then you'll see. - Come on, let's go. It's no good talking to him. He'll never understand this one. (mumbles) - Come on. Come on. - Remember who you're calling Teds in future, right? (mumbles) - Phillip, Teddy, come give me a hand with a piano. (dramatic music) - They're all the same. (mumbles) - Come on Johnnie. (classic music) (intense music) (dramatic music) Come on.(footsteps) - Hey, look at that there. (mumbles) (machine rumbles) (mumbles) Hey how about this then? (instrument playing) Relax. (piano playing) - Stop that! You come down from there. Come on down. What do you think you're doing? What right do you think you have to break in here like this? - No, we didn't break in. Anyone can go to church, can they? - Certainly, as long as they treat it with some totally respect. That organ is valuable instrument. If you're damaged it, it might cost hundreds of pounds to put right. - I haven't damaged it. - What's the matter Vicar? Anything wrong. - Hello Mr. Smith. - What was happening in the argument? - I found these boys locking a badge for this. Nothing to do with you, are they? - Never seen them before in my life. Probably my fault for leaving it unlocked. - Perhaps you'll deal with it, (mumbles) I'm trying to make them understand that church is a place of worship. - Goodnight Vicar. - Goodnight, Mr. Smith. - Well, we came in and found the organ unlocked. So Johnnie played it. What harm has that done? - What were you trying to play? Rock and roll? - Sort of yeah. - Surely that would sound better on drums and guitar. - Yeah, we got guitars but where do we play them? - We can't play them at home and we can't play them in the street, can it? - And where can you go? - Have you really tried? - Yeah, we had a group once. - Yeah, that's it offers to all of them to get out. - I suppose you could use the church hall. - It's church hall, we'd love that. - I think it's really my church all on quiet nights. - Yeah, he'd never let us do that. - Quiet practice tomorrow night. Why not come along? - Like gear, amplifiers and speakers and so on. - Surely, bring what you like, bring a jukebox if you want to. - You're not a clergyman too, are ya? - No, just the voluntary unpaid organist and choir master. - You don't want to use club, do you? (mumbles) has the choir. See you tomorrow night then? - Yeah, okay. - Yeah, maybe. (bus engine revving) - There we go again, ims and ping pong. - What is a scanner if we can always chuck in if we want to, can we? - We'd have to let all this stuff up here, no fakes mate. - Come on. (car revving) - I see there's an already choir bishop praises in there, that's not for me mate. (mumbles) (whistles) - Well, what are we waiting for, come on.

(mumbles) - You got a cup for us? - Yeah, sure take them. - You're the group my father said was coming over there. - Yeah, that's right, thanks. - Is he your father then? - Yeah. (mumbles) - Alright, boys. (mumbles) - What's he do? - He's rehearsing. - No, I mean, when he's not doing this. - He works (mumbles) Something to do with electronics. - Why does he do this then? - He likes it, I suppose. Biscuit? - Cheers. (choir singing) - Well done, much better, much much better. (mumbles) - Good, go and get your tea, well done. (mumbles) - They turned up. - Hello there. - That's splendid. This crowd will be gone in a few moments, then you can have the best of yourself. Darling, I've got to run off now, will you see that everything's knocked out, by the way, have met my daughter. (mumbles) She'll look after you. We'll see how it goes tonight. If you enjoy yourself, then come back anytime. Just on quiet nights though. She'll tell you when they are, all right? - Yeah. - Thanks. - Bye bye. (mumbles) - See ya, thanks. (mumbles) - Should I take your cup? (mumbles) - Thanks. - What do you play? - I play piano mostly, sometimes I play third guitar, if we got a drummer, we haven't, you what it's like these days, don't ya? I'll leave this with you, it's a bit hot. - Okay. (mumbles) - Come on then, what are we waiting for? (mumbles) What are we gonna play?(coughs) - Something we know. - We don't have as much choice, do we? How about this then? (piano playing) Are you able to sing(background noise drowns out speech) (background noise drowns out speech) (mumbles) - They're really good, aren't they? - Oh yes, if you like that sort of thing. - Listen mean, it takes all sort of music to make the world swing. (instruments playing) - Play me a guitar, mate. - Shut up. (instruments playing) - These guys could use some drums. - Come on what are you doing (mumbles) - I never really understood the meaning of the word cats before. (mumbles) You've short-circuited it because you've got it on the audio side. (mumbles) - Well then the equipment never was any good anyway. - But if you let me fix it. - It's got a bit dusty in there. (mumbles) - Of course we can't. - He's got a point there though. - Very true. - Yeah. - Try it now. (guitar plays) - That's all right. (mumbles) - Play that (guitar plays) It's marvelous in it? - Yeah sure (mumbles) - I'll tell you what, let's try it again then, shall we? - Yeah, sure. (mumbles) - Yeah you keep filling. One, two. (instruments playing) (mumbles) (background noise drowns out speech) - Is this where you live? - Yeah, I told you (mumbles) (background noise drowns out speech) - Hey, tell us more about your old man then. - Well, it's a bit technical. So if you want to know exactly what he does, you'd have to ask him or you could ask Tim, because he works with father. - Oh yeah Tim, that's the champ who fixed (mumbles) - Yeah, that's him. All I know is that there's some new (mumbles) It's very secret story, terribly fast. - I know, read about it with (mumbles) the other day it goes to 2000 miles an hour or something. - Yes, that's it. - I wouldn't mind a motor bike that went 2000 miles an hour. - Yeah, you fall off in the breeze. - Take up a forth(mumbles) - You are not bad. - Yeah he cannot take off.... (background noise drowns out speech) - Goodnight. - Goodnight. (whistles) - You coming, all right? - Coming where? - You know, we're gonna practice, go to that place. - Oh that. No, I thought I'd take Terry (mumbles) - No, we promised, didn't we? - All right, you go. There's bound to be a catch. - That catch on you, you're crazy. So one chance we've had to get together, ain't it? - You're only after that pretty daughter of his. - Well, what's the difference, you're only after Terry, aren't ya? Yeah, - You're wrong boy, she's after me. (choir singing) - Well done, much, much, much better. Heehaw tea ready, (mumbles) Good, same time next week, get your tea, well done. - May take this out here (background noise drowns out speech) Not so much noise, you lads. - Here you go, enjoy a cup of tea? - No, thank you love. - Look who's here. - Hello, where are your pals? - I don't see them turning up. They might've said, might they? - That's bad luck. Nevermind, you can get together some other evening. - I suppose so. - Oh, it's such a pity. Jimmy's brought his drums with him. - Well, have you? - Yeah. - But why didn't you have a gap between yourselves? Tim can help out. - Sure. - Well, yeah, we could have a bash, couldn't we? - Yeah, come have a look. (mumbles) - Do you mind if I have a go Bert? - No, just help yourself. You know how to play? - Well sort of. I played a Spanish guitar before, but not one with all these nubs. - We'll use a plectrum anyway, I sit and just sort of have a practice. (guitar plays) What are all these badges for Jim? - These, (mumbles) - What's that though? - Duke of Edinburgh. - Heard of him? - Yeah, of course, I've heard of him. - Jimmy's got a silver and I've got a gold. - This is jimmy(mumbles) - No, let's see, first string. But what's the point of badges? - Well, when you get your gold sometimes you make it to the palace, get out with Prince Philip. - You get tea or something though, do you? - Do you get tea? - No. - No tea. - Hello Johnnie. - Hi.

(mumbles) - He plays them as well. - You should've heard the drums, but they don't make any difference. - Yeah you're right. (mumbles) - There's no catch, he left as soon as we started playing. - What catch? - Bill thinks your father's trying to get us to join something, Annie. - Why, has he said something about the DV, then? - Hello. - Now, what's a DV? (mumbles) - It's a scheme for giving you tea at Buckingham Palace if you've got your gold, whatever that might be. - What do you know about it? - Well Tim and Jimmy have both done it. (mumbles) - Done what? - What did you do? - Public service with the Coast Guard, expedition to Hartford. I made a musical instrument for my pursuit and for my fitness, I did the long jump in the (mumbles) (mumbles) - So there's no catch. - Hope he wouldn't get caught. We wouldn't have time.

(mumbles) - We don't have a singer at all. - I don't know. (mumbles) - All those who think Terry sings like a boy, raise their right hands. (mumbles) - You don't take too much notice, but he's okay, really. - You're a lot bit like him. - What do mean? - I don't know, he's sort of edgy. You're not so? - Why should I be edgy? - I don't know it's stupid. Was that his girlfriend with him? - Terry? - Yeah. - Yeah, I suppose so in a way, why? - I just wondered. Thought she was more interested in you than Bill. - I don't think so. - Good. Goodnight then. - Anne.

I want to know how they all got their trousers so tight. It's easy, you just shrink them on. (laughs) Actually I think I'm about done by now. - I've never seen anything like that in all my life. Never, never. - They are tight. (mumbles) (laughs) - How do they look? - Not decent, if you ask me. - Well then they're done. - Try the other one. (mumbles) (laughs) - I didn't notice. - Hey, wait a minute, you can't go dripping all over the place, here take this. - No worries. (mumbles) if you're not careful. - Yes I probably will. (chuckles) - Do you know that Johnnie can't read or write music. - I'm not surprised. - Don't you think he's clever? - Cause' he can't read music? - No. Clever to play so well without. - It's a gift some people have, you must have a knack for it. - He has. - You're not getting too keen on this boy, are ya? - Daddy, don't be so squared, (mumbles) these boys, especially Johnny. The first time we've met, well since I was old enough for it to matter, whoever treated me with any sort of respect, he's much too tight. (squeals) Thanks. - Here. (humming) (instrumental music)(singing) ("Yes You Did") - Isn't that fabulous? Not the trousers, the group. ("Yes You Did") (mumbles) (Instrument playing music) - Why don't you tell him about the middle eight, man? (mumbles) - You should be going... Hey, I knew you could sing like a boy.

(mumbles) (background noise drowns out speech) - Who told you to get you jeans so tight? - Oh, Johnnie did. - Did you read his find out? Been wearing mine for years. - Have you? - Have you been on his bike? - No. - I have, marvelous, does it turn? (singing) ("Yes You Did") - You didn't tell me you were taking her out. - I didn't have to. - I did know we were going out together, (mumbles) - Not cheese. - Terry. - Got a light, love? (mumbles) - Have you got a light? - Yeah sure. - Mr. Smith, does this scheme of yours teach people manners? - If you think your scheme will make him less of a misery? - I didn't know, you knew about it. - We don't know about it. - But you're interested. - Well, they are, get them to join, give them time. - Because you are different. - That's it, different. - Says he's different, all right. - He's not just different, he's playing bloody mind games. (mumbles) - You might be sicker. (mumbles) - I said shut up. - Hello, Mr. Smith, what is it all about? None of us know and he certainly doesn't. So would you please tell us. - Well, I suppose it's main point is it gives people an opportunity of finding new interests. - What's the matter with the interests we've got? - I'm not talking about you. You asked me about the scheme and I'm telling you. Anyway, not everybody has your interests. Some people have hardly any interest in life at all. You need to push. - What if they don't want it? - Well, they don't have to have it. I'm not selling anything. It's just that some people get a kick out of doing something a bit out of their own red line. It satisfies them and helps others. It's just really a question of keeping everybody busy, I suppose. - We're busy enough, aren't we? - I'm not talking about you. I don't think any of you would ever go through it anyway. - Why not? - You need time, patience, bit imagination. You've got to be fit too. - Are you saying that I can't do your scheme because I'm lazy or stupid or feeble? - I mean, we couldn't do it even if we want it to, - Because I think that's a nerve. - Yeah, so do I. - I don't mean that at all. - Well, what do you mean? (mumbles) (background noise drowns out speech) - He's got a lovely patch up, a way to get us. - I told you you, (mumbles) would've joined anyway. - Old Bill, that never joined, he's different, didn't he? - No, maybe I am different, but I'll show you. I can do a scheme with my eyes shut, if I feel like it. - Rubbish. - Oh reall Let's just have a look in that book then. - Bird watching. - You must be joking. - No. - Bird watching. - That's what I said, bird watching. - Yeah, I know, but I thought you meant bird watching. - Don't be filthy. - Dear, have we got to do all this? - The required standards must be reached in all the following sections. - What's section is this? - Section A. Rescue and Public Service Training. - Rescue? - Well you know, lifesaving and all that. - Oh, what's the next expedition, then? - A three-day expedition, including two nights in tents, how about that, then, eh? - Girls go separate. - Oh yeah. - Well how about this then, section C. Pursuits and Projects, possibly saving to me for that. - Let's hope it's not bird watching again. - Keep it up. Could I, look. - What, you? - Yeah, genuine effort is required for a period of six months. - God, a whole six months. - I don't know, what was all the fuss about physical fitness, this is kid stuff. Listen, section one, running or walking a hundred yards. - Oooh Dump your book, look, it's running a hundred yards in 12.2 seconds or walking three miles in 36 minutes. - Three miles, how far is that then? (mumbles) - Yeah, what's the difference, it's kid stuff. - I bet you can walk three miles in 36 minutes. - Who couldn't? - You couldn't. - Of course I could. - You reckon you could walk from here to the Glen and back in 36 minutes? - Yeah, it's not fair anyway, is it? It's sloppy all the way. - Oh, yeah, (mumbles) - Okay, do you wanna bet? - Yeah, sure. - How much? (mumbles) (mumbles) it's was worth more than that. - I have five bob. - Five bob, okay, when? - Now. - All right. - No, sit down. - Sit down Let's just sort out what we're gonna do. How about this, lifesaving then, you fancy that? - Yeah, I think it's a good idea. - Listen, we got to sell all (mumbles) and I could buy a new costume at (mumbles) - I'll come with you for that then. - Who asked you? - Don't get any joy anyway, do I? (Laughs) (machine rumbling) (classical music) - You really know what you're doing? (background noise drowns out speech) - Hello Bert. Hey look, there's Terry. Terry! (mumbles) - Where did you get that or did you get that tile? - See you all later. (mumbles) - Put your hands well over the ears. Legs (mumbles) go. - You're not very good, aren't ya? John Ducker Johnny. - Bert? - What's up?

This one, this one. - Please go on. - That's the one I saw. (mumbles) Is this 34? - 34, yeah. (mumbles) - There's another rail over here. - Isn't this the same? They're nice, they're pretty. - That's nice, Anne. - Yes it's a nice one. - No the pink, the pink. - Can we check them both? (background noise drowns out speech) - Hey, come and tell me what it looks like. - Oh, it's very good. - Nice? - Yeah, it's quite nice, it's quite nice, sorry. - But you really like it. (mumbles) - Go put on the pink one. - Can you unzip me? - Yeah. - Go outside while I change. - Give me another kiss.

(mumbles) - Very much, (mumbles) - I wonder why, I didn't even ask you. - Hello there, come here often? - We come on special occasions. - And mating seasons. (mumbles) - Have this - Thanks very much. - Yeah, they just excuse me. Could you hold my cup? (mumbles) (mumbles) - Come on, let's sit down. - Haven't seen you lately in (mumbles) - Are you serious about Johnny? - Why? (upbeat music) - It won't work, you know? (upbeat music) - Nothing ever does with you. - Well, that's enough for today, I think Tim. See you at choir practice. - Yes, I'll be there. - Usual your procedure, I suppose, Benjamin Britten followed by rock and roll. - No, Johnnie's not coming tonight. He's going the old- (tool thuds) with Marco Marco? - Yeah. I suspect it was Anne's choice. Very sensible, too. They've got a very good dinner there. (soft classical music) - Thank you for the theater. Johnnie, I'm going to college and I'm going to meet a lot of new people, I want to. It's funny, but (mumbles) convinced me that. It's been great. Moved together unexpected. You're a real knock out, you know. - Splendid. - Shut up. - There's nothing wrong in that. - Well, you know, you won't be the last. Sorry, I didn't want to be bitchy. You know, I must be honest. - I never thought a marriage, you know? - I know what you thought, I know what you meant. It's gonna be funny, doing things without you. - Why do you want to decide now? You're mad, we can have fun until you go. - Of course we couldn't drive us both out the wall. (mumbles) - I suppose your parents have taught you how to have any natural feelings. - Of course they haven't. - I don't believe you Anne. - Well go and ask them then. - No, bloody likely. (soft classical music) (players yelling) - Hi Johnny, where's your gym knickers? - Oh, shut up. - Ben traveled? You're a sucker for punishment. (whistle blows) Look at them. Blowing the whistle, play out their team if you're not in the team, (mumbles) If you haven't got a badge boy, you're no good. - It's not like that. - Like helle it isn't. Listen who do you think you're fooling? I get you young and defenseless and I hang on. Conform and be happy. Yes sir, no sir. You've got to save the queen, sir. - What'd you have for breakfast? - Well, I'd rather live as I like and do as I like. And damn the rest. Where'll that get ya? (laughs) Nowhere. - The DEV is for the individual and not the team. That's what Smith says. - Smith says? - Yeah. - Poor old pikelet. They hooked him early enough. They can keep him. Of course you can't see it, can you? Of course it's for the individual so long as he joins the team. Don't worry lad, I'll save ya. (classical music) - See ya mate. - Okay, see ya. (classical music) (bell rings) - Hello Johnny. - Hello. - Looking for Anne? - Is she in? - No, I'm afraid she's out with her mother. - I see, can I have a word with you. - Sure thing, come on. (mumbles) (soft music) - Put your coat go down there. (mumbles) (soft music) - I was just going to have a drink, how about you? (mumbles) - Surely. - You want me to close the door? - Yes, please. - Now where the devil is that (mumbles) My wife puts everything in anyway. Well, sit down Johnnie. - Thanks. - One opener. Here it is. That's probably Anne. Is it about the group? - No. - Then it's about Anne. - No, not really. - What can I do if you're Johnny? - I wanted to talk to you see, there's a lot going on since you called us in the church that night. That there I don't understand. It's like this scheme of yours. How'd that get mixed up in that in the first place. - Here. - Thanks. - Cheers. - Cheers. - That's better, go on, you were saying. - I said it's like the scheme of yours. How'd that get mixed up in that in the first place. - Well, I don't know, as I said at the time, I don't know how any of it did. - That was a funny sort of evening. A little bit fed up. It's not motorbikes. - I didn't think you'd get through with it. - I didn't think we would either. I did it because I was bloody-minded, but Bills weren't bloody-minded though, beats the whole thing. You see just pushing your own idea's trying to make us conform. - He's really chucked it. - Johnny, perhaps he's right. - No scheme can suit everybody. - You think it just me? - I think it might. - I want to talk to you about it. (classical music) - Hey Terry. What the hell do you think you're doing? - Knitting. - Have you told your mom and dad? - Old joke. - Okay, then what is it for? - What do you think? - Let me tell you what for chuck and all that. - Well that was the other day. Now look why is it even a need if I just sit here and knit. - You're going to be such a drag. You never want to go to the pictures. As soon as it gets dark, you're off knitting and empty and bed pans-- - Look, do you want me to enter in my resignation. Dear Mr. Smith, I cannot carry on any longer (mumbles) as night's getting too dark. - Okay, suit yourself, I wish you'd make up your mind. - Hello Bert. - Hello mate - How are you? - Fine, how are you? - Fine, Still a lot to do, ain't ya? - Shut up, I got all this anyway. You'll see that tomorrow. (mumbles) - Do you want me to do that? - Yeah, sure. - Okay. - All right, clean this up if you like get them on the other side and have a go with that. All this blue and stuff. - Yeah, sure. How long have you been this in? - About four weeks now it's come down on it. - What are you doing, I thought this canoe was supposed to be for Bert and me. - He's here because I wanted him to be, (mumbles) - Yeah, go on, play with it. - Get starched. - Leave it Bill, I said it. - Oooh Go away. - All right then, don't get sore. - Hey Bill leave that, that's the part I spent getting it right. - All right, keep your writer on. (mumbles) - Knock it off, you'll get us chucked out. - Go away, will ya? - Come on, break it up. What's going on here? - Nothing. - I should think you'd have something better to do than fight amongst yourselves. - Go on, push off and leave us alone. - Yeah, push off Bill. - I'll see you later.
