(Gulls cawing) ♪ ♪ So how old are you? Thirty-two, sir. Thirty-two, good for you. Did you know there are 365 steps leading up to the Capitol Building? One for each day of the year. I didn't know that, sir. Hm. Now, I understand you're good at getting the job done. This ain't the kids' table. So I'm sure you'll understand when I ask you the question, why, Noah McManus, do you want this job? When I was 8 years old, my parents took me to see the Liberty Bell. On July 8, 1776, people gathered to hear the first reading of the Declaration of Independence, spoke of the injuries, the deprivations, the neglect people had suffered under a corrupt system. And the men who forged it, they put everything on the line to defend their fellow man. They fought for a better way of life. Senator Hayden, I've seen you fight too. I've seen you fight for the disenfranchised, the forgotten, the destitute. I know that you strive to make the difference. And as the current chief of staff to the mayor of Boston, I strive too, every single day. But I know, senator, that it is your office that has the power to affect lives throughout the country. And I believe that every person has the right to be served, no matter who they are. And I believe that you feel the same way. And that-- That is why I want to work for you, sir. (Phone ringing) Yeah? We'll be right down. Senator, they're ready for the vote. Pleasure to meet you, Noah. And you, sir. We appreciate you coming in. We'll be in touch, okay? Sure, thanks. The senator had one more question. Can you start next Thursday? Of course. All right. (Mouthing words) Yes! (Ringing) So? NOAH: Schedule the movers. What? You got it? Wendy, it was crazy. I was sitting there and I don't know what came over me, you know? but all of a sudden-- When do you start? Next week. I still can't believe it. Anyway, if we leave Monday, drive down and start looking for a place we could-- We? Noah, I thought you understood the ramifications of this, Noah. Ramifications? And could you not say my name twice in a sentence? It kind of freaks me out. Noah, listen to me. Live-in girlfriend is not a prestigious title. And by the way, I already own it. Moving requires more. Fiancé, wife, those are titles, Noah. Wendy-- Noah, my parents are expecting an announcement soon, and quite frankly, so am I. Can't I just enjoy this moment, you know, without this moment? Sweetie, enjoy it all you want, but while you're in it, celebrating all alone, just know that if we are not married, that is what you're entire life will be like. Nice, Wendy. I'll see you tonight. Can't wait. I got to go. (Sighing) No way. You want to bet? Congratulations! I can't believe this! What was it like? Well-- What am I asking what it was like for? You got the job. It was amazing. God, this is crazy. Yeah, yeah. And you know what else is crazy? What's that? I think I'm going to propose to Wendy. Now? Yeah. Now? Now. Noah, you're about to start the job of a lifetime, a job you've wanted forever, move to a city you've never lived in, and simultaneously you want to start planning a wedding? You're going to ask her now? This is not sounding like a good idea. I just want you to know that as a friend, your best friend. You're being negative. No, I'm just stating the facts and my opinion, which is that you're totally nuts. Come on, just support me even though you don't agree with me. Best friends do that for each other sometimes. Yeah, I know, and I've never understood that. (Sighing) You going to be able to survive around here without me? The Red Sox might missy you, but I won't. All right. No, no, no, wait. I was just joking. I was just joking. It was crazy, man. "Mayor Grantt and District Attorney Perkins in dead heat." "Grantt's lead vanishes." If everyone isn't aware by now, I'm an incumbent mayor. The election is in three weeks, and I've lost my lead. Mayor Grantt, looking at the polls, it seems that the voters feel that you're out of touch with their daily lives. Therefore? You and Mr. Grantt enjoy two lovely multi-million-dollar homes, one in Beacon Hill and one in Nantucket. Wave your salary for the term, and in exchange for your services, you will accept a fee of $1.

That way we encourage every registered voter to access their polling place. Next. Small business is at the heart of this commonwealth's economy. And for over three weeks, the Small Business Owners' Association has been trying to meet with you to discuss their needs. And consistently you've denied their request. They have a wide reach. Call them. Just get their endorsement, Noah. Just do anything. Just make them happy. What they want is to talk to you. Does it look like I have time for this? I don't want to be any later than what I am. Now just make them happy, Noah. Just do it. ♪ Mayor! Mayor, I won't. Excuse me? You asked me to make them happy; I won't. As in "will not"? That's your job! When I first ran your campaign, you listened to the voters, you looked for solutions to their problems. But somewhere, at some point, you stopped caring. You stopped listening. You stopped being the person that you were. Mayor, it is with deep regret that I-- Drive this car! Mayor? ♪ Do you even know where I had to go to get these? So the ring will be shipped overnight, and I'll pick it up when I get there? Great. Okay, thank you. I just bought an engagement ring. Over the phone, that you found online? That's romantic. Hey, it will be. Look, I'm going to bring Wendy here. It's in Cape Cod. And we're going to move to DC. Wow, it sounds perfect. Anyway, we only got 20 minutes. Grantt's on her way back, so if you want me to do anything, or-- I know you have a life here, friends, a routine, but it's going to be even better where we're going. You're going to love it. I promise. So what do you think? You with me? (Barking) (Chuckling) Wow, not going to miss the golden door. That's for sure. Have you thought at all about what we discussed? Have you? Yes. Really? Because I am left with no other choice. Noah, do you think I want to give you an ultimatum? Noah, do you? No. Because I follow actions, not words. Wendy-- And so far, I seen nothing. Noah, you and I, we have talked and talked and talked and talked and talked, and I haven't seen you-- Wendy! I was going to do this the right way, but... (Sighing) Marry me. Will you marry me, please? Marry me? The ring. The ring is on its way to Cape Cod, and so are we, as soon as you say yes. Yes! Yes, yes, yes! Noah, yes! Yes, yes, yes. Wait, I have to phone my mother. She's been waiting for this call her whole life. (Phone buttons beeping) I sent a message to Cherie and Scott. They were thrilled. Oh, they want to know what took you so long. Where is my phone? Uh... Oh, and I spoke to Jeffrey and Katie. They want to go to Maestro's to celebrate. (Phone chiming) Of course, I said yes. Hey, look what your fiancé just...found. Yes! Great, I owe you one. (Imitating kiss) Call you after the deposition. Oh, I know, we should go to Devino's tonight. Noah? Tom? What? How long were you planning on keeping this up? Noah, it's nothing, Noah. Stop saying my name. Let me explain what happened. Explain? I just read the explanation. I got it. It's pretty clear. Thanks. Listen, you have to believe me. It was nothing. W-w-what was nothing? Because that definitely appears to be something. Look, don't do this, okay? We are getting married. Trust me when I tell you that we are not. But I love you. I do. Noah, I really do. No, Wendy, you don't. You just want to get married to someone. But it's not going to be me. ♪ Come on, Arlo, get in.

I'm in the car, on my way to DC. Why are you calling me? Elliot? Yeah. What's going on? Noah, turn on the news now. RADIO ANNOUNCER: As we've been reporting all morning, the breaking news out of Washington DC involves Senator William Hayden, who has admitted to accepting illegal campaign contributions.

He told me I shouldn't do it. Propose. But of course I did. I decided to be bold. So I made the arrangements, the reservations, the whole deal. You know, I even bought a ring and had it shipped here. You know, and from the picture, it was forever, right? I spent a lot of my savings on that ring, which was okay, because, after all, it was my future. You know, my career was going really well. And I had this amazing new job, which I couldn't believe that I actually got. I was really going to make a difference, but first, I was just going to take a few days, which I never do, and one of those romantic, "you'll remember it for the rest of your life" weekends with my fiancée. Girlfriend. Ex-girlfriend. Honey, the ring hasn't arrived. What? It was supposed to be delivered today, under my name, Noah McManus. Sorry, but I'm sure of it. And if it's not here by now, it's not coming today. That old drawbridge could be so finicky. Finicky? I was just on it. Just got a call on the radio. Mm-hm, sometimes that bridge goes up for those boats, and it just doesn't feel like coming back down. But they'll fix it tonight. And I'm confident your package will be here tomorrow. Tomorrow? Mr. McManus, you've already paid for your reservation for this weekend. I'm happy to refund your money, but why don't you just spend the night? I can't. If you don't mind me saying so, it looks like you could use the rest. My-- My dog, he's outside. Actually, he's right there. MAN: Guess he found the backdoor. We welcome all guests. So what do you say? Thank you. Is there someplace I can get something to eat? There's not much open now that tourist season's over. Right. But I've got a good idea. Why don't you join us tonight for my Preservation Council dinner? It's right here. Everyone's invited. Even Sam's coming. That's okay. No, thanks. It's the only meal in town. I'm sure it is. Thanks again. Dinner's at 5:30. MAN: Mm, this is good. (Chattering) (Man laughing) Hi, you made it. (Speaking indistinctly) Noah McManus. Nice spread, huh? Could I have one more, please? Why don't you finish that one first, and then come on back? Seriously? You're going to make me get back in line for another half of a baked potato? Yes. I didn't even have the corn or the coleslaw, although I know it's good for me. Come on, look, I've had, like, the worst day you could imagine. I've been driving for hours. All I've had is chips and water all day. Do you know who I am? I was the chief of staff to the mayor of Boston. Now, I think that deserves another baked potato. Do you know who I am? I am the person who serves the potatoes, and I believe that every person has the right to be served, no matter who they are. Thank you. Sam. Hi, thanks, sweetheart. Ooh. (Chattering) So you guys do this often? LILLIAN: All year around. Tonight we're supposed to be here discussing the new crosswalk for Main Street. This year we're voting for new town manager, so I think this dinner is a chance for everybody to be friendly before things get, well, unfriendly. (Sam clearing throat) In a few days, there will be a town-hall meeting to hear the candidates' platforms. This year we got ourselves two people running for town manager. Ahem, Randall Richardson. Randal's family has been here as long as anyone's. Randall managed to build himself a small fortune by buying up real estate in different places and turning it into strip malls. I think he wants to do the same thing here. Randall wants to build an outlet shopping center and a movie complex. We're all in bed by 9:00. Who's going to go there, anyway? You know, I just don't get why Harpswell has to try to be all things to all people. What's wrong with being a small town in a big world? Anyway, in a few weeks, someone's going to be elected. So who's the other candidate? Me. Wow. I guess when you're old, people think you really know, plus nobody else wanted to go up against him. Well, look at that. Cupcake? Randall, is nothing sacred to you? This is our Preservation dinner. We are having some community time here. You agreed not to campaign. Lillian's right. We're just here for a nice neighborly dinner. You can't buy our votes, Randall. And no one wants your shopping center either. Well, I think some people do, right? And in a short time, we'll know just how many. Now, look, can we just calm down? He's right. Randall's plan will open a lot of doors for a town like this. Now, lay off of him. Yeah. Well, maybe some of us don't want to calm down. Am I right? Yeah. I mean, let's hear from everyone. Am I right? Me? Why not? Um... Okay. Well, I hear you. You know, I understand your concerns. Shopping center would probably mean, you know, more attention, you know? Which would mean more traffic. You know, crowded roads and littering. Littering could be a concern. But on the other hand, you know, this project could mean more spending, you know? Which could mean more income, which in turn could benefit the housing sector and the employment sector and eventually increasing teachers' salaries. You know, thereby allowing you to attract better teachers and therefore, more families. You know, before you know it, this-- This town could really blossom. Look, Arlo and I have only been here for 2 hours and 14 minutes, you know? And Harpswell seems like a pretty incredible place. I mean, you have a really special hotel here, Sam, Lillian. And really great food. I mean, this was the first home-cooked meal I've had in a long time, and it was really, really good. (Patting stomach) I'm-- I'm stuffed. You know, and I probably shouldn't be you know, giving my opinion or talking, because I'm not really sure even what I'm talking about anymore. So, you know, I'm-- I'm exhausted.

Oh, it didn't take a lot. Everything's online, right? Yeah, anyway, the point is I was wondering if you would consider working with me. Working with you? Yeah, like an aide on my campaign, you know? I'll make it worth your while, okay? I just think you'd be very helpful to me. I mean, you have the experience of someone who can help change people's minds. You've got the credentials. Look, I'm going to be the next town manager, okay? So I would love to be able to thank you for helping me to get there. I spoke out of turn, okay? I shouldn't have said anything. Look, Randall, thanks, but it's not going to happen. Ah. I'm done with politics. Sorry to hear that. Look, if you change your mind, call me. Sure. This place is so nice, you know? It will be a shame when Sam can no longer run it. Well, he can't do this forever. He's not getting any younger. Goodbye, Randall. Yeah. Noah. It arrived. Must be the ring. I'm sorry it didn't work out. Don't be. She didn't love me. Well, then it worked out the way it was supposed to. Thanks. What if, um-- ? Could I-- ? Could I stay another night? Sure, it's just Sam and me right now anyway. The boys are staying. Good. NOAH: Hey, Sam. You got to beat that guy. You're better than he is. I'm trying. Oh, I-- I met someone last night.

Yeah, I'd like to apologize for being thoughtless. And rude and-- Wait, what else did I do? Nope, thoughtless and rude just about covers it. I know, I was bad. I shouldn't have said anything. It was just, you know, I don't think that what Randall wants is necessarily the worst thing in the world. I think he probably thinks it's good for all of you. I mean, don't you want more people to come to your store? No, and I don't want to be replaced by a chain or some franchise, and that's exactly what will happen. You know that.

And then 50 years later, William Nickerson arrived from England with his wife and kids. They settled over there, Old Harbor Road. The whole town is filled with Nickerson descendants now. Nickersons, huh? Yeah. I know. And over there, my mom taught me how to swim. I was 5. She practically had to bribe me to get in. The water was so cold. She was pretty convincing. Anyway, so the town grew. And finally they built that, the harbor light. Wow, that's-- That's beautiful. Yeah. See, the thing is, we've always been a reserved town, a place where people didn't mind working hard. More than anything, we've always given people what they want the most, a community.

WENDY: So they go on a beach walking hand in hand, huh? Stay. I mean it. Stay. LILLIAN: Enjoying it? Yes, it's delicious. SAM: Lillian is a genius at making cocoa. Always has been. I can tell. Noah, you're back. Lillian, would you mind bringing Arlo up to the room, please? Not at all. Thank you for the cocoa. Mm. So delicious. Come on. Boy, is there anything around here I don't do? Good night, Sam. You drive carefully. I will. Noah. You were right. We would have loved being here together. Look, Noah, I am so hoping that now that we've had some time apart, that we can move on. Move past this hiccup. This hiccup? We can even go to counseling if you feel you need it. Or we can just start over. Noah, I don't even care that you lost the job in DC. Let me be perfectly clear with you. I didn't lose anything. You're not going to believe this, but my parents called this morning. They will buy us the house in Cambridge that we love. The house you love in Cambridge. Noah, we're supposed to be together. Wendy, we couldn't be more over. Tell me that you don't still have feelings for me. Enough! (Hailey clearing throat) Hailey. Your jacket. You forgot your jacket. Could you excuse us, please? I'd like some time with my fiancé. I am not your fiancé! I'm sorry to bother you. Hailey, wait. Why is she so upset? Go home! Look, I don't know if there's anything here for me, but I do know there's nothing here for you. No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no! Did you do this? You did, didn't you? Where is it, Arlo? Tell me! Did you bury it? What did I tell you, Arlo? Huh? Sticks, rocks, bones: these are the things that you bury! (Door slamming) Thanks. There you go. All right, bye. It sucks. We're out of the playoffs. Everything's back to normal. Hey, hey, Jesse, remember me? I'm Noah, you know, Hailey's friend, the good kid? Yeah. Yeah, well, look, I got a situation, and I really need your help, okay? Look, I bought this ring, this engagement ring. I was going to propose. That's why I came to Harpswell. Anyway, I'm at the Landing Inn, and I was up in my room last night, and I was about to take the dog for a walk. And, you know, he likes the walks on the beach. And I think he had the ring in his mouth. And, you know, he likes to bury things, so I think he was, like, digging in the sand. (Whistling) All right, everybody, come here! Bring it in. Come on. What do you need? Tell them what's what. Well, I-- I lost an engagement ring. What do you got? ♪ I found it. MAN: Hey. What? Yes. Jesse found it. Yes! Oh, my God, thank you, Jesse! Thank you! Thank you! Arlo, Arlo. You guys were great. Thank you so much. Mrs. Potiker, that is the best hat yet. Oh! Have a good day, Noah. You as well, Mrs. Potiker. Thank you so much for your help. You're a lifesaver. Good morning, Doug. Yup. How you feeling? You ready for this town meeting? I think. But I'm not much for making speeches and such. I know you'll do well. You just state your case. That's all you need to do. And when someone asks you a question, be direct. When someone asks me a question? Yeah, you know, about the town. Like-- There's a big old pothole in front of my shop. Visit or call the Public Works office, and if there's any concern for safety, it will be addressed immediately. My grandmother needs care that I can't give her. Work with the Council on Aging. They're there to help you and your family. I can't afford a fishing permit this year. Can you help me out? That's easy. Go to the Coast Resources Permit Department, and they'll give you a map of where permits aren't required for fishing. Why should I vote for you? Because I am going to make sure that this town retains its heart and its soul. But don't you think there's an opportunity for growth under the Randall plan? Excellent question but I have an answer. Look at all small towns that have welcomed big business. All the stores look the same. Nobody has time to know your name or ask you how you're doing. They're all too busy restocking the shelves. You know, and then the highway is going to overflow with cars. And you're not going to want to go to Main Street because you're not going to be able to find a place to park. You know, so, yeah, you know, I see it as an opportunity, an opportunity to change everything for the worse. How was that? You're it! What? No. You are it. You should be town manager. You're joking. You're just a natural. Really, I'm flattered, really, but that's nuts. You're the one running. I'm just here supporting you. Okay? If you say so. ♪ Hi. Hi. Look, I'm really sorry, okay? I had no idea Wendy was coming here. Noah, you don't owe me anything. In fact, I don't even want to know anything, so let's just forget it, okay? Wait. You owe me something. Excuse me? I've been waiting here for you for four hours, okay? Right here. So the least you could do is just give me a little bit of your time. All right? Okay. I came here to tell you that I don't know what I'm doing here in this town, at this point. I mean, I could absolutely leave right this minute. You know, but this is the first time in my life where I have no purpose. And I'm actually okay with it. You know? Just existing. I mean, yeah, you know, I got to figure out what's next and I will. But for right now, I'm totally comfortable just being here with you. And I'm grateful for that. Okay? So you-- You have any thoughts on that? Anything at all? I caught a fish. You did? Let me see. You don't believe me. I just want to see the fish. Ugh, that's horrible! It's a grouper. It's disgusting. It's delicious. You know, you really should throw this thing back. I'm going to eat it. Bury it. Tonight. I think it deserves a proper burial. I'm going to fry it up. It's going to be delicious. Ugh. Have you seen this? Yeah, I talked to the reporter about that. She didn't get the story straight. Yeah, well, straight or not, people believe what they read. And they're saying that my campaign is suffering, that voters are uncertain about my effectiveness, that I may not be "of the people" enough to represent them. So what now, Elliot, hm? Noah had plans for my campaign. What do you have? We're doing everything we can. No, that's not good enough. I don't think you have what it takes to put me over the top. I need a new line-up. I'm sorry, Elliot, but that's it. What if I can get Noah to come back? What? You don't have time to bring in a new team. Please, let me just get Noah. I can do that. You and I both know that's what you want. You just won't say it. Then do it. RANDALL: And as I've indicated, the flow of traffic will in no way interfere with the school buses during afternoon dismissal, okay? I don't want those people parking in front of my property. Now, Mrs. Potiker, I can guarantee that that's not going to happen. Yeah, right. Sam, aren't you going to say anything? Of course her property is going to be impacted by this project. RANDALL: Look, we're going to have arcades for the kids. We're going to have reasonably priced restaurants. He's just trying to distract people from the issues. What about the restaurants in town? Aren't those good enough for him? Come on, Sam, say something. What about Sole's Hobby Shop? If that scrapbook store, that sports store and that candle shop move in, what is he left with? Yeah. MAN: Yeah, what about that? These stores are going to bring in more people, more customers and more money for everybody. It's a win-win. This guy is unbelievable. Are you just going to sit there, Sam? Me? When are you going to stop telling everybody else what to do and just do it yourself? Great, well, to conclude, I'd just like to reiterate-- NOAH: I can't let you go on. It's not true and you know it. Noah, sit down, okay? Of course the stores on Main Street are going to be affected. I mean, this mall is going to affect every business. But, Randall, you're running for town manager, not developer. Does anyone have a question about how to acquire fishing permits? Or where to go if you need help with an elderly family member? Or what to do if you have a pothole in front of your house? And tell us, Randall, what would you suggest to your fellow neighbors who are experiencing these situations, huh? Well, uh, since you know so much, why don't you run for town manager? What in the world? Hey. Could I just-- ? Sorry, sorry. Sorry. What's going on? Why'd you come all the way out here? I need you. I'm desperate. Grantt is about to fire me, and you're the only thing that's going to save me. Please come back. Elliot. If you don't come back, I'm out. Please, don't make me work for my father-in-law. Please, I'm begging you. Look, I'm on my knees. What? W-w-what are you doing? Would you-- ? Get up. Look, Elliot, she'd never let me. Let you? She needs you. She wants you. Look, she'll even tell you herself. Whoa, whoa, whoa, no, I don't want to talk to her. It's all right. Don't worry. Elliot. Hey, it's Elliot. Would you put Grantt on the line? This will be good. Yeah. Yeah, hang on. He's right here. (Mouthing words) Mayor Grantt. Yeah, yeah, I heard. (Mouthing words) Right. Guys, come on. Give them some privacy. Go, go, go. Who's watching the store? I got the best friend in the whole world right here! Yeah, you do. All right. You know I don't want to go. Right now I just think we should be supporting Sam. Right. Well, I guess I should get going. Now, if there's anything you forgot, you just call us, and we'll get it to you. Thanks, Lillian. Thanks for everything. And we're going to miss you, little guy. I'm going to be checking in. I know you're going to do well, Sam. Well, we'll see. You take care, Noah. You too. Come on, Arlo. Arlo, you got to get in. Don't look at me like that. Come on, go. (Lillian chuckling) (Engine starting) Hey. Hey. I wanted to see you before I left. Yeah, I was just about to come to you. Um, baked you cookies. I was going to take one of those, didn't want you yelling at me. But they're for you. For me? Yeah. You made these? Wow, well, that's-- That's, like, the nicest thing anyone's ever done for me. And these are for Arlo. You made those too? But save them for the road. Will do but I think Arlo's probably going to eat his immediately. I know. He's allowed. Thanks. Um, you should go. You're going to hit traffic. Yeah. I'll be back. (Door opening) (Door closing) Bye, Doug. DOUG: Wait up, Noah. Be careful. The paint's still wet. ♪ NOAH: The Small Business Owners' Association is very important to Mayor Grantt. I know she's really looking forward to this meeting, Mr. Greenwood. Thank you so much for coming in. And there she is now. Right this way. Robert, it's so wonderful to see you. Thank you, Mayor Grantt. How's your son? Fine, thank you. Is he enjoying... Yes. (Door closing) Robert, I am so honored by your endorsement. I truly look forward to working with you. Good luck, mayor. Thanks again, Mr. Greenwood. Mm-hm. That went well. Good job. I have you to thank. You helped me to remember the kind of people who got me here. Listen, I know what you're capable of. We've come this far. The election is right around the corner. If we win, you can have any job you want in the new administration. Noah, there's no limit to what you can do. Who knows? You might even go further than me. Thank you. ♪ (Phones ringing) MAN: Mayor Grantt for mayor? TV ANNOUNCER: Preliminary results suggest Mayor Grantt is now leading in 16 of the 22 precincts, a surprise rebound after recent weeks of less than promising poll numbers. Contributing to Grantt's turnaround are the recent surprise appearances at the city's landmarks, such as Faneuil Hall and her volunteer teaching within the Boston School System. The mayor has been unusually active and visible, which, experts say, have led to one of the most astonishing revivals in political fortune in recent Boston history. (Phone ringing) Hello? Lillian, it's Noah. Noah, how you doing today? I'm fine, thanks. And you? Hanging in in there. You know, I wanted to come back sooner, but I didn't want to leave until I knew how things were going to work out here. Now I think the mayor may actually win. Good for you. Good thing you stayed. Well, I was calling to check in on Sam. I know today is his big day. He must be really excited. Actually, he's taking a little nap right now. This has been hard on him. He's not a youngster, you know? In fact-- He'd never tell you this. But last night he talked about conceding, telling Randall that he's out. Out? ELLIOT: Man, we are going to have a serious victory party. I think he's just tired. You know what I mean? Lillian, don't let Sam do anything, okay? Nothing. Okay, Noah. Bye. Another thing, I don't think it's fair that she's going to let you pick any job you want. You've already got the best gig here, so it's potentially like you got two jobs already. Elliot, I can't have two jobs, okay? I can only have one...job, because that wouldn't be fair. You're the best friend in the whole world. Can you and the kids watch Arlo for me for a few days? Watch Arlo? They're not going to want to give him back! ♪ Sam. (Phone ringing) Yeah, I'm almost done with these. Hello? Sam, it's Noah. Oh, Noah, we're just about to get started here. How are things where you are? They'd be a lot better if I could get over this bridge? What? You're here at the bridge, in Cape Cod? Yes, look, Sam, I really want to be there. I just have no way of getting to you. Oh, yes, you do. Noah, get yourself down to the old dock, and sit tight, just sit tight. ♪ Hey! Hey! Hailey! Hailey! Hailey! Hey! Hey! NOAH: Hey. Hey, here, tie a bowline knot. Uh, Hailey, I didn't make the knot, okay? I tried. I did but I asked Pete at the gas station. Just get in. Um, here, we should go. Yeah. Yeah, we should hurry. I need to get that book. What book? (Gavel banging) I hereby call this meeting to order. We will caucus in approximately 15 minutes to select the new town manager. Please take your seats. JESSE: Thank you. Your candidates are Sam Putnam. (Applause) Thank you. And Randall Richardson. (Applause) MAN 1: Randall! MAN 2: Randall! Now, if you'll be voting for Sam, you'll make your way to the left of the podium. If you'll be voting for Randall, you will make your way to the right of the podium. In accordance with the laws of the commonwealth and the Book of Ordinances of Harpswell County, we will now proceed with the election for new town manager. Remember, for Sam, to the left. For Randall, to the right. You now have 10 minutes to proceed. What? I told you I was coming back. What's happening here? How did this room get so divided. Noah, I think maybe we've just been outnumbered. It seems more people than I thought think Randall's ideas are, well, better than mine. But they're not. I think he's winning. No, he can't. Noah, give it up. You and I don't get along so well. Therefore, I don't think this is the most appropriate time to start talking to me. Fine. SAM: It's okay. Everything's going to be okay. No, Sam, it won't. Hey, can you stop the clock for me? Yeah, for you I can do anything. Do you guys even know what you have here? Sam Putnam, he's your best friend. He loves this town and the people that make this town what it is. He's got integrity. He's been a pillar of this community for over five decades. And he's dedicated his life to serving this community and to welcoming people, so that nobody feels like a stranger here. Like me. Nobody knows what visitors come to Harpswell for better than Sam. They don't come here for another shopping mall. You know, they come here to visit Betty's Bakery. Best banana nut bread I've ever had. You know, and to see Hailey's bookstore. She can actually suggest the right book for you. She's read them all. And they come here to see the harbor lighthouse. Have you seen that thing all lit up at night? It's beautiful. And they come here to see the cottages and the gardens, like yours, Mrs. Potiker. Oh! And they come here to see where a tribe of Native Americans first settled this land and where William Nickerson came with his wife and children to find freedom from religious persecution. Sam and Lillian care about everybody in this room. And Sam's as forward-thinking as anybody. You know, he wants to shepherd this town through the times ahead, but he can only do that with your votes. Look, I've been in politics for a long time. I've worked for a mayor. I've worked for council people, lawyers, clerked for a judge and I nearly worked for a senator. Now, I've seen them all. And not one of those people is as trustworthy as the man standing right here before you. Sam's one of the best things about this town. Too little, too late for this. We've already heard the speeches. I'm prepared to vote for Randall. Oh, my God. MAN: Who here is with me? Hey, it's not a speech! It's from his heart! Let the kid talk! (Mouthing words) NOAH: Thank you, Pete. You need a town manager that will ensure that your family, your business, your dreams are possible here in Harpswell. Yeah, Randall can bring a few stores here. But at what cost to you and your families? All of us, as a community, have got to tell him that he can't use this land as a foundation for his own bank account! What? You've got to really think about this. Who do you want to be your town manager. Huh? Who? I vote for him! Huh? PETE: Yeah! MAN 3: Yeah. What? Do it, Noah. Stay here. Work for these people. These are the people who need you. Okay, personally, I've had about enough of this. Noah, you've got what it takes. You've got experience. You've got drive. You've got time. Look at me. I'm not spring chicken. I only got into this thing because I wanted to make sure that the town was in safe hands. But with you, I know it will be. Sam, I don't know if I'm prepared to do this. You are. You just didn't expect it. Noah, you love being in the middle of things. You like figuring out why things work or why they don't. You like helping people. You like figuring out what people need. You're tireless and you're dedicated to things that you believe. And I think that you are the perfect candidate. Are you out of your mind? This guys doesn't even live here. He's not even registered to vote. I don't want him to vote. I want him to win. That he can do. Okay, everybody, there are two candidates here. There's Sam and there's me. And that's it, okay? Actually, Randall, no person serving in a council position-- I mean, you are on the Preservation Council, aren't you? Yeah. No person shall challenge a run for office of this town's administration without abdicating their former officer position first, which means, Randall, you're not allowed to run for town manager, because you're already holding another job here. What? That's bogus. Oh, really? Maybe. Sir. Chapter 53, section 83. Read it. Thanks. Yeah. Touching. Look, even if that's true, and I'm not even sure that it is-- It is. don't you people want a representative? You know, someone who actually lives here? Come on. Wait. (Coins clinking) Sam, would you take this ring as a deposit on a room? Well, now, that depends. How long are you planning on staying? Indefinitely. I do. Are you sure you're up to this? Yeah, it's what I've-- It's what I've always wanted. ♪ My name is Noah McManus, and I want to run for town manager! (Cheering) Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much.
