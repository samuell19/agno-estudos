Welcome to the World of Tomorrow. You are about to take a journey out of this world into the world of the Future. Forget the world around you. Forget the people around you. You are entering - When I grew up, in the Minneapolis Paper, there was the cartoon series called "Our New Age" by Athelstan Spilhaus. And every week it would be on a different aspect of the future. On Sunday morning you'd read it and you could dream. What became important was the idea that every invention had been perceived as outside the realm of reality at some point in history. And they all became real. - Two, one. - You were going to be on the moon. You were going to be flying cars. This was what was supposed to happen. And this idea of doing an Experimental City – it must be real, it's in the newspaper. - Really the essence of the Experimental City is to try to build complete new controlled-size cities with new technologies, in the open lands of the United States. Looking toward 25 years from now. - I think Spilhaus wanted to believe that you could do this on a scale which would allow results to be utilized worldwide. Not the idea that it would scare the dickens out of whole regions of Minnesota and become public enemy number one. - Well, is it working right? Doesn't seem to me that light's winking, isn't it supposed to wink? Yeah that's about right, isn't it? If I put it, if I put it down like this... - Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished colleagues, I'm going to talk about experimental cities. And at the outset... - Athel and I met after he came down to the University of Texas to work on the accretion of an underwater city. That grew out of his Experimental City project. They would take, it was like a chicken wire or something as simple as a chicken wire and form rooms and houses and buildings. And then they'd shoot an electric current through it. It was almost like a coral calcification that would form around these electrified wires and actually build buildings. He definitely felt it would work. It's not like, you know some crazy off-the-wall spaceship kind of thing. I made, maybe the mistake one day of saying "Athel someone has to record your life." I just kept saying Athel somebody has to do this, this has to be put on paper. And finally he said, "alright, then you do it." Chapter one. - Is it recording? - Yes. - Now what do you want me to do just when we come to something that... - If something stirs you up with a story then go ahead and tell it. Okay? - I told you I don't look backwards. Why are you writing it down when the damn thing is getting it? - I was more pleased and flattered than I can say about being invited to introduce Dr. Athelstan Spilhaus, until I saw his biography when I realized: how do you introduce the speaker who has done everything? He's a mighty intellect. A student of our times, a futurist. And I can assure you is a most unusual person. He evidences a kind of Rabelaisian brilliance. - Are you offended by being called a 20th century Da Vinci? - I don't like the "a" – "the." I always get an answer, I'll say that. - Dr. Spilhaus is a native of South Africa and obtained his masters from MIT. - Massachusetts Institute of Technology 1936, 37. - Now that's '35. I was 24 years old. I invented a thing called a "comfortometer." And God did I get kidding about that – a thing that tells you if you're comfortable or not. - You start with observation, observation leads to understanding. Understanding leads to prediction and after prediction, control. An engineer should not merely sit back and predict the inevitable result of carrying on present practices. He should design the future. - And even now scientists and planners are shaping the lives of our children who will live in the 21st century. - Now if what I say seem like dreams to some of you, I remind you that you and I have had dreams and seen them rapidly become reality. In fact, dreams are indeed the stuff that practical progress is made on. - His life became a whirlwind of activity and adventure. Never was he still for a moment. - It's gonna make a hell of a movie script. - Can you imagine? I wonder who they'll have do you. He was a showman, I mean he was in the middle of everything there for a while. He liked to be head of the committee. - Dr. Spilhaus, I want to thank you, sir for coming to Science in Action to tell us of your committee's work in this field. - A moment ago you said that we Americans often seem proud of wasting so much and I'm afraid this is very true. Often we even seem to measure our economic success and prosperity by the number of manufactured things that we throw away. This kind of thinking is dangerously close to insanity. - Inefficiency did not suit Athel at all. - Yes that's very true. Another way of putting it is, the way I would put it is that waste is just a resource that we don't yet know how to use. - He was busy doing something at all times, brain was being engaged. Inventing, tinkering, in control. Sorting out the world and making it function better. And if he couldn't, he'd get quite irascible. - Now I have gained the impression that the future perhaps of our entire nation might be dependent on the way we look at this waste problem. Well I believe that this is profoundly true, Earl, I think we should get away from waste and I think waste can become a serious danger. We seem to have been sort of chicken in the United States about our efforts to attack this massive problem. We know how to do things better in the control of pollution. But we have no opportunity to experiment. We knew from our waste studies that there were excellent new technologies for the reuse of waste. But you can't introduce them into the old cities. Who's going to float a bond issue for an entirely untried brilliant new technology? For without exception, our cities are hopelessly bound by tradition, restrictive legislation and their unplanned, unhealthy growth. It's time to look at alternatives. I've sounded rather pessimistic so far and I don't want to leave this impression with you, the picture is not all black. I'm an incurable optimist about science because I've read the history of it. Sometimes if we look hard enough at a problem scientifically we can find an answer even to seemingly impossible things. And I thought about having a little city and trying waste management things in that city. We will try to build a noiseless, fumeless city where you can take the same technology that has caused the smoke and the grime and the polluted rivers and use this technology to clean it up. Then I thought, but heavens this applies to mass transit, it applies to most everything you do in a city. Why aren't we able to do these things? It's too experimental. That was the beginning of the idea. We must be prepared to step boldly out and experiment with new and radical ideas for improved urban living. We must utilize the most advanced methods of building construction, the ultimate in transportation, in communications, in waste removal, and in city management. And the place to try them is an Experimental City. - Alright, chapter two. When I began to study the Experimental City, there had been lots of writing about pollution but the issue hadn't reached any serious levels yet. Radical ideas, however, have difficulty gaining acceptance and what I was proposing was a completely new concept. Fortunately I didn't have to sell the idea. Otto Silha of the Minneapolis newspapers did it for me. That's S-I-L-H-A, isn't it? - Yeah, Silha was the Publisher of the Minneapolis Tribune. - I was a friend of Otto Silha's and had worked with him in Republican politics. He was a progressive kind of a guy and interested in ideas that might improve things. And in our culture at that time, newspapers were one of the leading institutions – not only to report the news but to influence civic activity and bring to the attention of people new ideas and progress. - Newspapers were important. I know I read two or three a day. Sometimes even the St. Paul paper. If you're Publisher of the Minneapolis Star & Tribune, you're an important person in the community. - He could sit at dinners at the Athletic Club and raise the issue and be taken seriously. And once Otto put his mind to something, Otto was unbelievably persuasive and successful. - There's no question, it's true that technology is ahead of our ability to absorb it. The scientists, the technologists – they have what I think is increasingly becoming a moral obligation to act in a situation of domestic crisis. - Otto was not an engineer, he was not a scientist. But he had seen decay and blight and rising crime in his own city of Minneapolis. He'd witnessed the flight to the suburbs. He had great concern about the future of American cities and he figured the Experimental City could be a guide throughout the country. - This is a program about what cities will be like in the year 2000. It is a call for action, the time is already late. - Americans have never liked the cities or trusted them but now we're afraid of them. - 30% of the space in our cities is devoted to the car. In Los Angeles, it's 70%. - No Metropolitan area has been able to work out plans to solve more than a fraction of its problems. - I mean there is no other system today for what we're talking about trying to change. - Otto was a believer. Otto had decided this would be a good thing for Minnesota and the United States and the world. And Otto – he was the person you wanted on your side. - The Minnesota Experimental City is the brainchild of Athelstan Spilhaus, dean of the Institute of Technology at the University of Minnesota. He found that new technologies couldn't be tested in old cities. He conceived of the Experimental City as a laboratory for urban technology. I talked with Spilhaus this morning. - That is one function of the Experimental City, it's not only to be a viable city in itself but to be a laboratory for the testing of both technological and social innovations that once proven can be introduced into the older cities. - So I wrote about the Experimental City and I began going on a speaking rampage and I suppose when you speak enough about your own ideas you convince yourself it's a good idea. - ...Let's have some improvisations and new things. In fact this gets to the real crux of the situation. Do we want the city of 2000 A.D. to grow as a kind of a cancerous organism? More of the same. Or do we want it in a new spot with new technologies instead of doing it in the old fashioned ways? There's a good question. Well now, couldn't we invent the city as a machine for a certain production? That's how anybody builds machines. And then you don't overload the machine later on. When you get to that size, you should build another one, not just let it spill over and jerry-rig the machine so that it has to take an overload. - In other words, to definitely hold it to a certain population. - Each year in the United States, we're building the equivalent of a dozen new cities of a quarter-million every year. We're mass producing cities. And if we're gonna mass produce cities, we better make a prototype before we go into mass production. My guess is a quarter-million would be a pretty good size for a prototype. - It had to be built at least a hundred miles from any great city, with lots of land around it. - Because without surrounding reserved land, it will be swallowed up and cannot really develop with enough independence to try novel technologies. The essence of an experimental prototype is that if you make mistakes you can correct them. That's the essence of the Experimental City – that it be continually changing, because in experiment, you must make mistakes so that you can learn from them and change them. I don't know, I haven't thought this through but it sounds like a good idea. - There used to be a persistent dream in America that somehow our cities would inevitably get better. But like the man with a broken leg, nothing gets better unless it's set straight. - Gentlemen, I'd like to propose a toast to the Vice President of the United States. - To the Vice President - Cheers. - Cheers. - Thank you very much my friend Otto. Of all the subject matters that are discussed in recent years, the most frequent discussion is on the subject of urban life. How do we make our cities better places in which to live? Now that's where I come in with my good friend Dr. Spilhaus. I'd like to see my state, the North Star State, be a guiding light for discoverers and explorers. Somebody has to have the vision and the daring and the courage and the plain unadulterated guts to look ahead and to see what could be done. - They had started something and they needed to continue to make progress. So they put the Steering Committee together to enhance the stature of the project by bringing in people with significant reputations. - I think the key thing to keep in mind is that human beings are smart. They act instinctively but they also use their heads. And human beings will act in their own interest if they know what their interest is. - The tasks ahead are obviously enormous. However, the project has a certain magnetic quality attracting brain power from all over America. - Man has be so relatively ignorant and has made so many mistakes that he tends to think that man is supposed to fail. - Buckminster Fuller. - He thinks it's sort of illogical and preposterous to think about something called utopia or that things are working. I don't think so at all. We're going to catch on that the new norm is that man is supposed to live in utopia. - Dr. James C. Cain, Professor of Clinical Medicine – Mayo Clinic. Mrs. Muriel Snowden, Associate Director of Freedom House. Walter W. Heller, Regent's Professor – Department of Economics, University of Minnesota. And Whitney Young, the Executive Director of the National Urban League. - Otto knew how to put people together and get the best out of them in terms of political support for the project. General Schriever, for example was very, very highly thought-of and a very skillful fellow in terms of how you make things happen. - (Two, one, zero). - And in terms of political influence, a Four-Star General opened a lot of doors. - I did say nine years and Otto said 10 years and I said, "why not make it nine." But I think if you set a time schedule that's slower than that, the problems of the next decade are gonna be so bad that I don't know whether we'll do any good. - Athel, I have a comment to make on this. It seems to me that there's no question that this Experimental City will still have a hell a lot of skeptics. But I don't think we should come up with a plan of action that will be looked at as being completely ridiculous. Now I think you've got to... - Well let's not discuss the practicalities before we discuss the desired objective. The desired objective to me is to plan the city for a certain number and fill it as soon as possible with that number. - (I think we all should have in mind, though...) - If we're gonna get it done, we need to do it now. - With as many people as possible in as short a time as possible. - (...the available alternatives, that can be put into the experimental picture.) - I mean that's – I wanna tell you that there's not great complexity in these things. Think of the mentality of the people that were doing it. And so you have hundreds of different experts coming into MXC to look at all the elements which might impact how that system will develop. - In the Experimental City, it may be that many little things that you'd get now on a mass communication basis you might dial up individually. - The computers back in those days filled walls. They were huge. But we were pretty sure that by the time the city started to be built, there would be small individual computers that could be done in homes. - Video terminals can provide access from any point, for libraries, schools, hospitals, entertainment centers. And bring together electronically the now separated functions of shopping, charging, banking, credit and business. - And that's the picture that got across better than anything else. That this world was coming. I was not a technician but I was fascinated by what my colleagues were talking about and doing because I could see the implications for the learning system. - You gotta keep up with the times you know. - Yeah but there's 3D and 4D, you know, what's next? - What's next? You never know, you never really know. - There had been a number of suggestions on the innovations that would go into MXC. So I was going to be looking at architectural and design aspects of the urban problems of the day. I was happy with that, I needed the work and I was looking for some income. MXC would become a test bed for a transportation system that could perhaps substitute for the interstate highway system that Eisenhower started because he liked the Autobahn system in Germany when he was there which incidentally was started by Adolf Hitler. - A dual-mode system would take cars that could just drive normally on streets onto kind of an on-ramp, that would test your car for about 30 seconds worth of diagnostics. And then it would shunt your car onto an electrified and automated guideway. Here we go on the high-speed safety lane. - Welcome to the World of Tomorrow. Climb aboard. - And so if you have propulsion in the track and computer direction, then you can have many of these inexpensive little packages as a mass transportation system that takes people when they want to go where they want to go. Okay, okay, we like what you say. Take us that way! - Under our present system, as the amount of things that people use goes up, the amount of things they discard goes up and consequently pollution must go up. So that I think that in the Experimental City, one of the most important things is what I call "industrial symbiosis" – planning combinations of industries so that any wastes of our manufacturing processes can be reprocessed and put back in the factory. - Things like that when you were talking to Athel and it's like, I never thought about that my God, you know, yeah. There is no such thing as waste. You figure out how to reuse it, there should be zero waste. - It may not be possible to accomplish complete recycling of wastes immediately. But this objective should always be borne in mind in all our city planning. It's a question of pre-design. - How big would your model city be? - I mean when I first proposed the idea, I just picked a figure of a quarter-million. I suspect that's too small to give the number of choices that people want in a city. But the essential thing is that let's build the networks to serve that city and not allow the growth of the population of the city. - Cities normally grow above the ground and as people demand services of transportation, power, water, gas, sewers – the streets are dug up and these services are buried. In the Experimental City, we can anticipate the population we have to serve because the city will be of a controlled size. And the whole sub-structure beneath the earth's surface can be pre-planned to carry these services before the city is built. Now the sub-structure could either be excavated or you could raise the ground level. When I talk about underground, I mean under the lowest level where people will walk. Underneath that would be a rabbit warren of tunnels – tunnels to take out the wastes to processing plants outside. There would be fume sewers to take off whatever gases the businesses and factories generated and all these things would be open underground so one thing we'd get away from is digging up the streets. Much of the service end of the city will be invisible and inaudible underground. Communication wires, power wires, utility pipes and lines can be underground, pre-planned. Water and building materials could be stored there. Heat and cold can be stored there. The parking of air-burning vehicles that connect the city with the rest of the nation can be there too. And the fume sewers can take away their foulness. - So that when some particular element became obsolete, that can be taken out and new ones put in. - It is urgent to try new technological improvements because everything one does has an interaction, a chain-reaction on the other parts of the system. For instance, if we put in the ultimate communication system. So that people may communicate to work instead of commuting to work, it would reduce the needs of the transportation system. If we control the filth of factories at the source, then there's no need for zoning. So factories, schools and homes could all be in one complex. And this again reduces the need for transportation. Reduced transportation reduces the pollution and so forth and so on. Then you come to the cost of the Experimental City. Everybody asks what it will cost. - General Schriever pointed out that obviously there was gonna be massive private development here but that it was not gonna be possible without planning money and pre-design money from the federal establishment. You have to have a high level of support. - I was on a task force that Lyndon Johnson appointed: Technology, Society and Economic Growth. It was what we would do with the peace dividend after the Vietnam war was over. The assumption being that that money would no longer be spent on the military that it would be there for other uses. - Why don't we suggest that the equivalent sum of money put into the Experimental City will be a far greater and more constructive thing to do. - While one would think that the moment we would walk in with this project, everyone would just jump at it, but that wasn't the case. - Once Vietnam is over with – and this thing's got to come to an end sometime – there's gonna be money available, this is gonna be a major problem and then we ought to be ready to go. - Yeah I quite agree, we have enormous federal subsidies... - Between now and the year 2000, our population will increase to 400 million. - This is at the time that many people were projecting huge population growth for the country as a whole. And so that was a big concern, where are we going to put all these people? - We're going to need to spend a trillion 500 billion dollars for new houses for twice as many families to live in. - You see, we're going to spend the billions and billions on conventional development. in the present urban centers and the conventional isn't working too well. - Total 3500 billion dollars. A sum 10 times the size of our national debt. - The money you're gonna spend on the Experimental City is money you're gonna spend anyway – schools, highways, water, everything. Housing 250,000 people. And not as well, and not as wisely and not as strategically. And in that context, a whole new city had a lot of logic behind it. - There is nobody that had ever built a city like this. People had created cities, but this was something special. And so it was a question of how you present this in the best light. - The whole space program became a model for many different things nationally. And so the hope and expectation was, the Experimental City would be of the same proportion and produce similar results in terms of national policy and resource allocation. And in terms of public relations would produce a man-on-the-moon kind of atmosphere. - Otto being a newspaper man, I think he was probably more interested in the public relations aspects. The things that would excite and attract. - Well that's an oversimplification, shall we say, but it does get to the heart of the problem. - Somebody probably said, let's have a dome over the city. And they said: yeah, let's have a dome, a Bucky Fuller geodesic dome. - Just as the elevator broke through limits on the practical height of buildings, so can newer technologies break limits of thinking about cities. And for a mind as inventive as Buckminster Fuller's, there's no limit to the ways it might be utilized. - You're familiar with my geodesic domes and they do do so much with so relatively little. So that when they get to half mile and larger geodesic spheres, the energy losses would be such that you would have really a tropical atmosphere the year round. You could open all the windows in all the buildings and let the heat go into it and it'd be so stable, it wouldn't get very hot or very cold. - We were the people that could dream big things. This was the nature of being a Minnesotan and the nature of being American. If we could think it, we could do it. - All these things illustrate the magnitude of what we can be involved in here. Because that really is going to be the ultimate genius of the city when the pieces are put together. - The Experimental City is the putting together of all of his ideas. From pollution to population. And then you've got tinkering that comes in. Athel would just reach out somewhere out in space and grab something and make it work. - I recall, I always used to wonder about the status quo, why were things being done this way and not another way. And that's the beginning of inventiveness, just a challenge. And sometimes you come out with a way of doing it better. - There was so much joy in his life, with his work, and his ideas, and his brain was a joy to him I think. - It had gears and little girders and modular kind of things you could put together into all kinds of shapes and forms. Kind of engineering construction kit. - What we call an Erector set? - Exactly Erector was a copy of Meccano. - There would be this softness, or this twinkle that would come around when he'd talk about his Meccano set. That I think was the first real toy that he ever had. He was deeply attached to it. Time-worn and well-used. And of course it took care of all of his engineering and creativity and ideas and inventive part of his mind. You figure out how to reuse it. - All of the buildings in the Experimental City will use the newest lightweight materials and modular techniques of assembly so that they can be easily erected and more importantly, quickly disassembled as we learn what is needed and as times change our needs. Disassembling them like an Erector set so that the reusable components of the building can be swallowed into the city's sub-structure to be used again. - Could you give me a specific idea what this new community would look like. - This is part of the experiment. I can't tell you what it would look like because that's the freedom of architecture and the variety that we would want to exist in the Experimental City. Though carefully planned for a certain capacity, we are not so brash as to claim that we are aiming toward an instant utopia. We'll plan it from the beginning so it's subject to change because in experiment, if you do not make mistakes you probably don't make anything. You know when I spoke about experimental cities, people said to me, what are you trying to be, some kind of a Hitler or something, telling people how to live. I really was trying to give people, by calling it "experimental," a choice. You see, nobody knows the answers to city livings of the future because it's never been shown to them. And if you don't know the answers, I'm brought up to say, I do an experiment. And the real value of this Experimental City from a sociological point of view will be after it's built, continuing the long-term studies that hopefully can make cities which exist a little better. And for that reason I think that we are gonna go off in the wrong direction if we think in terms of this as a city where we try to change things once it's built. - Then can you remember that it's an Experimental City? We are not designing an instant utopia, we are designing a conglomeration of people, enough people so we can experiment with various interrelated systems. - On a continuing basis. \On a continuing basis. - I think a good description of himself was I'm a great committee man, as long as I'm the head of the committee. He would come up with an idea, he'd come up with a solution where everything is mathematically so and it was done in his brain, okay I've done it. - Well I wouldn't want to narrow it down so much but the... - But if you call it a "University City," there have been university cities and there are university towns essentially in the United States. - He would take people who disagreed with him on to a certain point and then it was like, if you can't get this, we don't need to converse with each other further. - Gentleman, let's take a five minute break and get some coffee. - Let me add one word here... - Let's take a five minute break and get some coffee! - You know I can't spend my time dealing with this. - And at least as titles are concerned, highlighting the fact that this is experimental and that the people are guinea pigs may have a political backfiring. - Nobody wants to be part of an experiment. - The word "experimental", it did tend to scare people. - Pause for a minute, I have a comment. - Yes, yes. - This is all way overkill, I mean, Jesus Christ, you're gonna have no room for anything else. - It will be edited. - Repetition, repetition, repetition. This I'm getting bored with. - Well, now do you want to wait until tomorrow? - No I don't want to have duplication anytime! Complete waste of time. - He was perpetually throwing pearls in front of swine, he just couldn't do that. And if something wasn't his interest at the moment, he'd just go on to something else. - You can say that this story shows that he could never hold a job. The point is that when it got boring I just quit it. - That was kind of a blow, I'd have to say. The idea was sufficiently exotic to many people that it needed those credentials behind it as represented by Spilhaus. - Spilhaus was obviously the intellectual genesis of the Experimental City, it wasn't Otto. But Otto was a realist in the sense that he knew what he was trying to do was important and they needed to keep it moving forward and if suddenly that got lost, it would never come back to life again. - Good evening, my fellow Americans. I speak to you this evening about very important developments in our search for peace in Vietnam. We have been engaged in discussions with... - Initially the expectation was that Johnson would be re-elected. And then when he didn't run and Humphrey was to be the candidate the great hope was that, being a Minnesotan, this was something that he would be happy to champion. - What a day you give me in Houston in this great Astrodome. - If the president says I'm in favor of it, all of a suddden, you'll find there are a lot of people lined up in favor of it. - We wouldn't be sitting around the table here probably if it weren't for the Vice President's forceful help to us. But it's always going through my mind you know, when I talked with the Vice President, I always kept urging Hubert to go across the street and brief Johnson on this in the full light and he never did it really. - Richard Nixon goes over the top with 287 electoral votes and that seems to be the 1968 election. - I admire a fighter, he never gave up. I know exactly how he felt. I know how it feels to lose a close one. Winning's a lot more fun. - As the project moved along, I began to suspect that it was going to be troubled. The Nixon Administration was not about to fund a project that was clearly identified as a Humphrey project in Hubert's home state of Minnesota. - It's quite clear that the several proposals that we have submitted to the major federal agencies HUD, HEW, so forth, are pretty much dead in the water. - They're dead in the water, I grant you. - As, as such. - And we're sending out the repair boats. - It became apparent that it was going to have to demonstrate some success at the state level before it was going to be possible to get any significant federal attention, let alone money. And so we were totally focused on Minnesota at that point. It meant go back to restart. - You're rolling a bolder up the hill here and every little inch makes a difference. And you talk to legislators and some people will say it's absolutely crazy. And then again we had people that say: "Well, let's think about it." You know that there are two things that you don't want to know the process of. One is making sausage and the other is legislation. And this would be no exception to that. We had more hearings in the Senate and finally got it up to the floor of the Senate and it was passed about 4:30 or five o'clock on the last day. - Charles says, "It's precarious" and I said, "Here's plan B – If this doesn't go in Minnesota we go to Wisconsin." - Here we've got the Minnesota state government interested enough to create a quasi-governmental agency. And its principal task will be to work and develop site criteria and designate a site for presentation to the '73 session of the Legislature. - Having a tangible site in Minnesota, it would no longer just be an idea. - Although it really would still be just an idea, but – having a tangible site and public approval as it were, we would then have a real platform from which to move on. - So they must select the site before the legislature convenes in '73. So that our pressures then will be to get the Governor to act and appoint this 11-man authority. - Very rarely do you have a chance of a fantasy becoming a reality in your life. And this was that point. And all these things that you'd studied, because I was an urban historian, suddenly I was the person like they were a hundred years before. I'm standing there and we're on this hill and there's beautiful lakes all around and you could just see this gorgeous setting for a city. And my first thought that came through my mind was, should it be Lefko Lake or Lake Lefko? We had done what we thought was an effective screening process and there was the site that everybody loved which was Douglas. Beautiful, lake filled, this was going to be the town in paradise. Now the town in paradise already had people who didn't want their lifestyle changed. And so in reality there was no way in God's green earth that we were gonna be in Douglas. When you can't go somewhere politically, what is your choice? - I did gather from your description that this area was really very attractive. - It isn't Dorado Beach or something like this. - Why put yourself behind the eight ball? Is there something about it that makes it an ideal place for a city? - One of the things that recommended it was the fact that it is about 85% in public ownership. So you're not going to have to go in and disrupt a lot of people. - The site is terribly important and it shouldn't be based on availability of land. - Well all I know is: with the elements of protest in our country today, we haven't been too successful in getting people to agree, and if we're gonna really build this city, you've got to get the land. - I can't tell you that everyone jumped up with joy and said someday my soul will be in Swatara. But given the fact at that point you didn't have time or the money to go back and redo the rest of the state, then Aitkin becomes as logical as any place because it's the poorest place. They will not only welcome you with open arms but you are the heroes. You are the saviors and salvation. That was our perception of Aitkin. - Although the first planning for MXC got underway in 1966, Aitkin County residents said they hadn't heard about it until this year. Director of the Experimental City, James Alcott... - Well the people by and large were very curious and very nice. It's a classic Minnesota response. - And we met with county commissioners, talked with them. - They were not so taken with the idea of the Experimental City as such but because things were so desperate, some people could see what any kind of economic development up there might mean. - It would mean jobs for young people who now move to the Cities. - The Experimental City Authority people have been studying this for years. We take it for granted that they know what they're talking about. That the money is gonna be spent and if it's gonna be placed any place, we want it in Aitkin County. - But those surrounding the proposed city site seemed to oppose the concept of a new city. Their reason: destruction of the environment. - My folks came to this area after World War II. My father had respiratory problems where he was born and raised in the Chicago area as was my mother. But in his 20s, his asthma became so bad from the pollution there that it became life threatening. The doctors there told him that he could very well die if he didn't leave that environment. And so moving to Northern Minnesota saved his life and probably mine as well because, I was not born yet. People live in this area to be able to breathe fresh air. They don't have to rub shoulders with other people. Very natural, very pristine. People come here to escape the urban setting. - Well I was raised here and when I was 16 I went to work in St. Paul for a while. That's the year I met Ben and he followed me to Minneapolis and he didn't like it even worse than I did. And his parents gave us a piece of property and we started building our house after we got married and once you start building on a piece of property that has nothing before you, you just become attached to what you have. And somebody's gonna come and take it away and make it into a city? - We were well aware of what we were going to be up against. We are talking about billions of dollars on one side and just ordinary folk on the other side. But there was also a feeling that we had at least one government agency on our side. - Some of the people in Swatara were incredulous that the state would think about taking their property, taking their land and creating this futuristic monstrosity. I became a citizen activist in the environmental arena largely because of mining waste being dumped into Lake Superior in enormous quantites. The company was making all these profits but the waste from the mining– just dump it in the lake. You do get angry about it and wanted to do something to stop it. So that kinda guided my future. In 1971, the legislature passed a provision that the Experimental City Authority was to be reviewed by the Pollution Control Agency for environmental impact. - A very vague statement: what the environmental impact of any proposal is– well, hell, that could mean anything. And the fact of the matter is there's some concern on the part of business industry and everybody that the Pollution Control Agency could in fact run the state. - You're talking about 55 thousand acres. If you were gonna actually have 250,000 people there, you were gonna have air pollution, water pollution, destruction of the landscape in that area. Just the size of it. Why did they propose such a huge city? And that led me to believe, I always felt that this was not an Experimental City, it was a massive development to make money, that's what was behind it. - Well again, from the day one our whole approach is to preserve and improve the environment. I mean if anyone can get approval from the Pollution Control Agency, we ought to be able to do it. - Otto Silha invited me to lunch at the Minneapolis club and he showed me all the support and I thought, Oh my god." Well this is a pretty strong support here, Mr. Silha, but I'd like to know what is the generation of power? - And he said, "probably a nuclear power plant." - Well that wasn't too smart, I was against any more nuclear power plants by that time. And so I said, "If you can commit that the power generation for this experimental city will be solar power, I will support it." And he couldn't do that. I was sticking my neck out because well, I probably would have been sorry if he said, "Okay, we'll do solar." Then what would we do? - Would you have supported it if he had said? - Well I said I would. - Here was the agency whose function was to fight pollution and we thought we were being the national and international model of how to stop pollution. - A conflict is emerging more and more clearly between two rival philosophies. Two wholly different and antagonistic ways of attacking the environmental crisis. - This seemed so logical to us that the idea of having environmentalists against us was something that almost was internally offensive. - This represents the philosophical party in power. The certainty that the same technology which has gotten us into such terrible trouble can get us out again. The second school of thought is out of power centered on the campuses. - Save Our Earth! Save Our Earth! It's broad and it's deep. - This is for the people! - It's a reaction against the endless multiplications of cars, highways, cities. One of the momentous news stories of the 70's will be how this country makes its choice between those philosophies. - We had to show that we didn't really want a city here. To draw attention to it. And we talked about what could we do to cause more publicity. How people got on the news. - Wipe out of your mind the questions of technology, technology never decides a war, it is the will of the people that decides a war. - And at that time there was a lot of unrest. People were against things and wanting their voices heard. - I don't have to do it, it's my home and that's what I'm fighting for, that's what I'm fighting for, nothing else. - And we said okay, let's start a petition and get people to sign it and take it to the capital. We started Saturday morning from the general store in Swatara. It was kind of a bright sunny day but the wind blows there like... - This is not an afternoon jaunt. Mid-winder in Minnesota, that's not a friendly time when the environment is concerned. - Ashes to ashes, iron to rust - Ecology is the most generally appealing of all the causes of the Love Generation. - You were born under the shadow of the bomb, you are the first generation in the history of man to carry DDT in your fat and Stontium 90 in your bones. - You think this will be a fad? - I don't see how it can pass over because it's here, it's now and it's real. - We've reached the point where our technology produces more kinds of things than we can live with. We have to choose to say "no". - In the midst of this demonstration a small bird fell out of a tree dead, it seemed an ominous ecological sign to the crowd. - Going around Mille Lacs was probably the worst morning. It was 30 below zero and the wind was horrendous that morning. Prickly and cold. Whoever thought to walk to the Cities in January. But it did show people that we weren't giving up just because it was Minnesota in the winter. You can sit and be quiet or you can take a stand. - I don't think the MXC Authority anticipated the kind of resistance that developed. We had a clear focus, and we were going to be there until we knew one way or the other. - It's a great pleasure for me to be back here on this occasion. We're seeing at this time, it's the right time because we are seeing a burgeoning of aspiration and concern of people with regard to the quality of the environment. And such aspirations and concerns are excellent. But what is not excellent is that this has resulted in a body of uninformed vocal opinion which one might characterize as supporting non-engineering or even anti-engineering. Non-engineering takes place when protests and action, sometimes in the name of conservation and environment, stop us providing for people's needs. What is bad is attacks without proposals, actions that result in non-action that lead... - It all gotten really wild trying to deal with it 'cause there are so many aspects to it and at this point I'm walking around with my eyes crossed. - Yeah. The scientific progress is tremendous and the technological progress is tremendous. But society's use of technology is abysmally dumb. - Progress has gotten to the point where it's massively destructive. Maybe you know what I'm trying to say. - Progress ain't always so in other words. - ...technology that we need to use to give us the quality environment to which we aspire. We see the problem and as engineers we try to tackle it. - This was something based on a comic strip by that professor Athelstan Spilhaus and I was not too keen about that kind of a city. But it wasn't my final decision. - The final decision would have to be made by the state legislature. If it fails to do so by June 30th of this year, the project will fail. - We knew we had a fight on our hands but we also believed that if we got the citizen actively involved, we could beat it. - ...legislature-financed study into creating quote, a model for orderly growth in harmony with the environment. Today the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency is holding a public hearing on the MXC and harmony is not at least so far the theme. An overflow crowd of those opposed to the Minnesota Experimental City. - That they will tell government just what we are trying to say. That the idea of relocating population masses rather than treating and solving the problems of cities where they exist is just as repugnant as is the concept that when human and physical resources of one place are exhausted, you go somewhere else and exploit fresh ones instead of regenerating more in the first place. We have people in rural Minnesota that are capable of thinking for themselves and capable of governing themselves. - I remember it being a really tough day. - We ask that the people be allowed to speak. - One of those where you sit in a hearing and all you do is you look at the door trying to figure out how can you get out quickly without anyone noticing you've left because this was not a good discussion and it was not going well. - But to answer my question, yes or no, you did not give the people an opportunity to enter into the decision-making process in the selection of Aitkin. - Not prior to November. - Have they had the chance to vote yet? - No. - No they have not. - I think they knew they were in trouble, they were in big trouble by that time, I never asked them. But we don't usually talk about the MXC too much. - What is it that prevents you from understanding the psychological effect of going out in the countryside and laying something on these people. I mean this is the kind of reaction that you get. - What does this committee expect to do with us? - It's unconstitutional in my view. - Where do they want to move us? - Democratic or communist country. - Why in this beautiful north country do they want to build a concrete jungle. - The main objections from the northern residents is simple: they like where they live the way it is. They feel that if a city moved into their area it would cause nothing but urban blight. - We had to believe in ourselves that we were doing the right thing and something that was on a broader scale and we believed that people, if they could see things the way we did, they'd see that this had benefits. - This city will have no cars, there would be no money. Everything would be bought and sold by credit card and a computer. This will be a monopoly city and the worst part is that, it would leave people without jobs. - Machines do more, men do less, relate less to each other, become interchangeable parts of the machine. - Technology, thoughtless progress and a concept of everything bigger has already taken its deadly toll on the environment. - It was the question of having people that you were in the same environmental groups with now questioning your sanity. - There is an overriding concern that perhaps the scientific advances that these people have brought to the world are finally threatening the very life of the planet. - I am a scientist, an engineer, an oceanographer and a meteorologist. But I feel almost like a defendant the way science and technology is blamed for everything and I'll say at the outset that I don't take that view. I think experiments, we have ceased to be daring and experimental in our large problems that involve people. We have a ridiculous thing of thinking that bigness is necessarily bad. And environmentalists, they were the people who said stop doing anything because it pollutes and they were against nuclear energy. I thought all this was nonsense and so I probably said: Oh yes there are always problems on any new innovation and all the doomers can think up 50 reasons for not doing anything. Everybody, all the eco-maniacs want us to stop putting nuclear power plants up. Stop what you're doing they say, stop making technological advance. There's an awful lot of nonsense emotionalism that people yelling about the environment, I called them enviro-maniacs. They're self-styled ecologists who embrace this new cult of what has been known as the environmental movement. That didn't mean that I wasn't a true conservationist. We do indeed need to do some things differently on a very large scale in regard to our environmental problems. And I'm sure we will do so. - All of us want to think that we're contributing to a change for the better. You become so attached to what you believe is the future, and a better future. - But we need these big experiments and we need to build cities which combine. - And all of a sudden... that better future has disappeared. - Well we just, we've been saying many things many times, haven't we, Max. - We sure have. - Through the years. And the trick has been to get other people to see them as clearly as we see them. - It just seems incredible that something that has as much promise as the Experimental City has finds it so difficult because of the attention to the conventional. - But Otto there's a fundamental problem. People do what they want to do and there are some things about cities that are there because of that. - But they'll never know what they can do unless you show 'em what's possible. - We're learning more about the accuracy of past climate models – how accurate were they? - Yeah this one's pretty cool Tom, published in Forbes yesterday, it turns out that one of the earliest climate models published 50 years ago was dead on accurate... - I thought we were gonna pull this off. - When you're an American in that period, of course you're gonna do it. - It's also pretty strong evidence, that today's climate models that project 50 years into the future are also pretty accurate. - You know they say you always learn from these painful experiences. Well sometimes it takes years to learn from it and sometimes, they become more painful when you remember them than they actually were when they happened. - In some ways it reflected the growing end of an era. And the era was where big concepts in science and technology were supposed to solve large-scale public issues. And those days were changing. - Everyone has his thing you know, and I do my thing. And my thing is this: that I am an optimist. I believe that if we make a national goal, we can carry it through, we did in the space program. Why can't we do it and have a man-on-earth program just as we had a man-on-the-moon program. We should just put in there at the end of that, later I thought that the site for my Experimental City should be the deep ocean. - Great. - Huh? - Uhn ha. - The unused deep ocean. - You know from the years I spent with Athel and talking to him about his early years and the things he did, there was so much enthusiasm and joy and optimism there. You know serious involvement in big, big things that were happening in the world. And then to watch everything just kind of go flat. I think he felt that, I really do. And then by the time he and I started talking about the future or got past his early years, I did not feel that enthusiasm or optimism anymore. But is that for real, or is that where we all get when we get in our 70's? You know? I feel that way. Is that old-people stuff? Or was that Athel seeing something that was actually happening? I don't know. I'm not equipped to answer that. - Okay well, we're not getting anywhere. I wanna see some of these things before I die. Alright... Well I just wonder. - We'll get busy, we'll just get real busy but you just don't plan on dying anytime soon, okay? - Well I don't know. - I just won't have it. - I don't know. - I refuse to have it. - It's a chore, living. - Isn't it though. - I have a benediction for our program this evening. From "A Glance Behind the Curtain" by James Russell Lowell. - 1999 AD. More than a generation away... - New times demand new measures and new men. The world advances and, in time, outgrows the laws that in our father's day were best. And doubtless after us some purer scheme will be shaped out by wiser men than we – made wiser by the steady growth of truth. The time is ripe, and rotten ripe for change – then let it come. The promise of the future, not the past. Fitting words for the Experimental City. Gentlemen, thank you.
