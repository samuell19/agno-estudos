Come, I've something to talk to you. A prize? - Yes, a prize. I've got a prize! I won't lose my temper. The guys're flattering me. Really, sit down... And sign it. OK, what s it? Baldy, Jr's school application letter. Itisn't, it's a resignation letter. Why do you want me to resign? Of course, no cops risk their life like you did, sign it! Isn't this a cop's duty? But you've got a wife and a son. Jumped without second thoughts. It's ready from the 3/F. 13/F2! You're insane, now just sign it! If I resign, who'll support the family? You can't do that.

Please listen to me! You won't care, will you? Kodojak, when will you drop by, we all miss you. Visit you when you're free, Playboy. You're smart. I don't know them! Come on! And two more charges. Darling, no taxi! Taxi! Taxi! Please forgive me. Forgive you! You're out of your mind, why should I forgive you? I dare you to jump from here, forgive you! I want toys. Wait, go away first! I want to buy them now. Alright... let's get some toys. What is it? I didn't order rice. I'm here to save my son. Is it your son up there? Right! What are you doing carrying this then? Give it to me! You're afraid he'll starve! Son, I'll get back the prism and swop your mom in New Zealand. I might never return, What do you want to say, say it! I don't want you to blame me, there're 2 alternatives. First, the orphanage. They have no toys and it's boring. What's the second? Go to new Zealand with me to save your mom. This is good. And third choice? - No. Which one shall I choose? - The second one. I want to save mommy. Kid, you're great! Hands stretched! Raise them! Raise one foot! A somersault and then walk a few paces. Comein, do it... It's easy! Mommy! - Where? There! I'm scared! Your dad's last wish asked me to take care of you. How can I break his wish? You're loveable. - Let me kiss you. No. - You said you love me. 1 did meanit. Raise your hand! Let's run. What shall we do? - We ask them. Hello... Darling, what is it? Dad, be brave and don't cry. - Can't hold it. I'm useless. The prism is gone, and I can't save you. At least we're together. You've agreed on a fair exchange! Asleep! Hit me in my sleep? Want to scare me? It's good seeing you, let me hold. - Thanks. Sam, how're you! Overjoyed... Look, Kin's here. Cody! He wants to compromise. OK, let's shake hands. - Let's do so. Cody, Sylvia, Sam! On behalf of Interpol, congratulations. It's our credit, not yours. The HK Royal Police is so proud. This is our case, they solved the case, it's our credit. You're being unreasonable. Hold him please. Foon! Yes, teacher! - Get the club. I dare you to hit me. What if I dare? - Stop fighting now! Yes, didn't you have enough! Let's shake hands! Compromise! Goon! Why such a heavy one? Why are you so angry? What if I'm angry? I'm not scared! Come on! Stop it... Enough.
