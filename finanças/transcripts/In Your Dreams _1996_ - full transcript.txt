[people chattering] [pen tapping] Anyone know what this is? Not sure. You seen "Alien?" So when was the last time you got this close to a naked woman? What's the time now? [Jamie laughs] Do you know what I hate? When they kiss your ear. They just put their big ol' tongue in your socket, swish the wax around, and leave the whole thing drenched, it kills me! Saliva generally, I think. Wetness, not my bag of chips. Had a guy once who kept actually licking my face. Is that not good? No, it's not good. [Man] Can't give hand jobs, either. She's dead, isn't she? No, women generally. Can't do it. There's no wrist action. No, I think it must be the angle, always pulling towards them rather than straight up, you know? And the more enthusiastic they are, the worse it is. And at least you get enthusiasm. Last girl I persuaded to touch my stub, she was like all ginger. It's like she's trying to pluck a turkey. [Jamie laughs] His teasing thing that slays me, when they kind of go to put it in, then don't, pull back, and laugh like they're all powerful and you're begging for it. It doesn't light my candle, I tell you. Women. Can't live with them. [men laughing] Do you know what I get off on? I mean, apart from the sex. [women laugh] It's the bit afterwards, when you've done all the business, and you can just relax. [upbeat music] * I guess I'm all right * * Guess I'm all right * * I guess I'm doin' fine * * Guess I'm doin' fine * * Did you think I'd miss you * * Did you think I'd care * * Did you think I'd lay down and die * * You never even tried * * You never even tried * * Now it's about time * * It's the right time * * If you willed your mind * * You will your mind * I know, I'm just saying it's kind of a poxy way to spend an evening, that's all. Yeah no, of course I'll be nice to her. I know, I know. No, she's sweet. Anyway, she used to be. [birds chirping] All right, sis. All right, yeah, I'll call you tomorrow. Oh, listen, you owe me one, all right? See ya. [phone ringing] Hello? You what? You just talked to him. And was he, like, looking forward? Really? You sure? [Clare giggles] Excellent. Okay. See you, Susanne. Haven't seen her for donkeys. My sister set it up. She's her friend? Yeah, her age, too. They giggle together. What about? Oh, well, get this. Apparently, she used to have this crush on me. Congratulations. [Jamie scoffs] [birds chirping] [Clare groans] Right, I've gotta go. Gonna bring her to the pub? Yeah, bet on it. Share the love. Your choice. Yeah, listen, don't mention the party. I'm gonna drop her off before we go up there. Easy. Have fun. Yeah, right. * Ooh la la la * * It's the way that we rock when we doing our thing * * Ooh la la la * * It's the remix sound that the refugees bring * * Ooh la la la la la la la la la la la * * Fugees, hey * Teeth! [Jamie laughs] * Ooh la la la * * It's the way that we rock * [Jamie knocks] Coming! * Ooh la la la * * It's the remix sound that the refugees bring * * Ooh la la la la la la la la la la la * Do it. Hi. Hi. How're you doing? Good. You? Fine. Excellent. Come in, then. In, right, thanks. * For Akon is MC murderin' * -So this is my room. -Is it? Well, it's nice. It's kind of pokey. Yeah, well pokey's nice. * 100 MCs all go murderin' * -No it isn't. -No it isn't. [both chuckle] She's beautiful. Didn't he used to be taller? So what's the plan? [Jamie Voiceover] Should've brushed my teeth. Jamie? Sorry. I said so what's the plan? Buy some chewing gum. I haven't really made one. Oh. Cheers. I thought maybe some food, you know? Yeah, whatever. That's a bit crap. That's a bit crap, isn't it? Well, it's not thrilling. Is that a party? [Clare] I guess. Well, let's crash it. Yeah, we're not invited. Says who? Come on. All right. This gonna be all right? Sure, it's all about confidence. Walk in like you mean it, they never stop you. Anyway, I said to Tamsen, I said, "Tamsen, sweetheart." May I have your name? Sorry, can I help you? I'll need your name. Oh right, I'm the artist's brother. But which artist? The painter. I'm afraid if you're not on the list, you can't come in. Let's just leave it, Jamie. No, no, no, no. Could I just have a word, mate? Listen, mate, here's the thing. I'm on a first date here, so you could do me a real favour, you know what I mean? [Doorman] Yes, I know exactly what you mean. [Jamie] So just be sweet eh, please? [Doorman] I'm afraid if you're not on the list- Oh no, no, no, no. Bollocks to the list. -If we could just- -I'm on the list. Does that make a difference? Hutchinson plus guest. I beg your pardon? Hutchinson plus guest. Why didn't you say so before? Well, we had a bet when we first saw you. Clare here said that you probably had a stick up your ass, but I gave you the benefit of the doubt. Can we go in now, please? Guess I lost. [people chattering] Right, let's mingle. So glad you could make it. Ah, now this one speaks to me. It does, does it? Deafeningly. Deep, isn't it? Which is, of course, not to say it's not without wit. Thank you. You paint it, did you? It might be just as true to say it painted me. I'm sure that's right. I don't know what it means, but it sounds spot on. This is a nightmare. What, not seeing anything you fancy? Oh, hello, nibbles. [Clare Voiceover] All right, so he's not how I remembered, but he's cute. [people chattering] Mm, this is more like it. Want some straw? Keep it away from the cheese straws. Do you want to say that again? You didn't get quite enough in my eye. Good evening to you both. Oh, good evening. Are you showing here tonight? Me, no, no. Clare is, though. Congratulations. Thank you, yeah. It's the nude with the pot plants. Say you noticed it, please. Oh, absolutely. Expressionist in tone. I like to think so. Well, I think we're bonding. Would you like a cheese straw? [Clare laughs] [lively guitar music] Cheers. Okay? Fine. Is the food good here, then? All right, yeah. So listen, when did you cut your hair? Oh. Oh god, ages ago. I like it very much. Well, thank you. Just Susanne never mentioned it. You talked to her recently? Recently, no. No, not since she set this up. Right, me neither. She sounded well, though, last time. Excellent. How's the rest of your family? Mum, she's good, doing fine. How about your dad? Do you see him ever? Yeah, I see him. Yeah, 'cause Susanne was saying- Oh, I don't wanna know what Susanne was saying. You what? She's got her take, I've got mine. Okay. The guy's a prick. That's all there is to it. Yeah, whatever, right. I have some unresolved anger. Prozac not working? [Jamie chuckles] There's an idea. I'm sorry, he just- Forget it, it's my fault. No, rubbish. Maybe I should go out, come back in, and start this again. We can talk about something else. Of course we can. You start. Cool, a sing-along. * For he's a jolly good fellow * -* And so say all of us * -* And so say all of us * -[cork pops] -[people laughing] Right, I'll get the waiter. Hey, excuse me. Look over here. Excuse me. Please? Won't be long. Excuse me. Look over here, you piece of shit. This always happens. I've gotta work on my, you know, presence. I'll have a go. [Jamie Voiceover] Oh, magic. How can I help you? You can start by coming a bit quicker next time. [Clare Voiceover] You what? It is quite busy in here tonight. Yeah, even so. -Jamie. -I do apologise. -Forget it. -Twat. -Do you want to order then? -Too right. Yeah, I'll have a garlic bread, and a number 18. [Jamie Voiceover] Does she not wanna snog me? [Server] And for you, sir? I better have a garlic bread as well then, please. [Server] And afterwards? I'll have the number 12. [Server] Very well. And we'll have a bottle of the house red. -Actually- -Is red all right? I'll just have a Diet Coke, thanks. One Diet Coke? Do you not wanna drink? No, really Coke's fine. Yeah? Okay. This guy's gotta go. Well, did you get that? I think so. You still want the wine? That is what I ordered, yeah. You know, we do serve half bottles. [Clare snickers] Well then, that's what I'll have. [Server] Right. Hard isn't it, with waiters, not to make a total dick of yourself. You like a fight, don't you? Trust me, I'm all mouth, no trousers. Is that so? [Jamie Voiceover] Teams are lining up on the pitch, warmup went well, tactics are simple, should be a breeze. Now, get flash. Just gonna go for a pee. Oh right, okay. I'll be here. That's good to know. [Server] Your bottle of wine, sir. Thanks. Listen, I'm sorry about before. Oh, not to worry. When the girl I'm with comes back, do you think you could tell her that I've apologised? Well, he hasn't got a way with waiters. And was he always this nervy? Still, I do like him. Best be friends, I reckon. Yeah. Right, then. On we go. Hi. Hi, more makeup. We're looking good. I've just been chatting with that waiter. Oh? Yeah, think we sorted stuff out. He might mention it. Great. Well, cheers then. -Cheers. -[glasses clink] [Jamie Voiceover] And it's kickoff. [Clare sobbing] Hey, hey, Clare, please, please. Look, what's up? Talk to me. Right, here's the options. We go to the pub, meet my mates, or we could just hang out together a bit more. You've got mates? Yeah, I pay 'em. What do you reckon? Pub's good. Yeah, it'd just be kind of crowded, you know? That's okay. No, I mean. What? No, you're right, you're right, pub it is. [Clare sobbing] I'm not sure if you're aware, but, I do now, I'm under obligation to take this further. I don't get... The college has a strict procedure. The police must be informed. I didn't realise. I see that. If you wish to, to proceed, I can promise you my total support. Thank you. * We are young, we run green * * Keep our teeth nice and clean * -* See our friends * -Get that down. What is it? [Jamie laughs] [Clare coughs] So you guys all live together, then? That's right. [Jamie] Though not in the biblical sense. Good meal? -Yeah, fine. -Yeah, great. So how are you settling in, Clare? It's good, no trouble. Nice one. What you studying? German, isn't it? No, it's French. -Course it is. -Yeah, me too. I can't be dealing with languages. It's like there's a different word for everything. Whatever you say, pal. * We are young, we get by * Do you want another? Steady. No, not just yet, thanks. So listen, are we all going to Rachel's party, or what? Come again? [Clare] Is there a party? Apparently so. You up for it? -Is everyone going? -That's the plan. -Yeah, count me in. -Excellent. * Cross the fields * * Lost control, hit a wall * Our boy's trying hard. I can't see why, myself. Ah, she's sweet. You're too good for this world. [Jamie] It's a nice night. [Clare] It's lovely. People are always rushing, don't you find? One place to another. I guess. They should stop sometimes, you know? Take the load off and chill. Oh look, there's a bench. You want to sit down, is that what you're saying? Is that okay with you? Yeah, why not? No, I just don't think I'm gonna see her again, sis, that's all. Yeah. No, she's nice and everything, I just, we just didn't really hit it off, you know? Now listen, don't ask her about it. She'll probably just slag me off. No, it's no big deal. So I figure we're at the point of the evening where I make a move. I thought we were just taking the load off. No, that was a ploy. How are you gonna do it, then? Well, I have to say, it's gonna be tricky. The way we're sitting there's what, four feet between us? So if I'm even gonna think about starting something, I've first gotta scooch all the way towards you, which I'm not sure I can pull off without it being so cheesy. -Kind of. -[Clare giggles] See what I mean? I have to say, that was cheesy. Our problems are only just beginning, girl. I'm supposed to have, you know, tactics at this point but I can never, my body just gets in the way. Like, this arm. This arm's supposed to be around you, around your shoulders, but how do I get it there? I could shiver. Excellent, 'cause then I could go, are you cold? And put my arm around you, like for warmth. Which is also neat, because if you're meant to be cold, you're practically compelled to snuggle up. I'm not that cold. Work with me, would you? [Clare] Sorry. But now it's still tricky, because I've got this other arm, see? What do I do with that? You'll never know how much I appreciate that. I'm still not home free. Why not? Because, beautiful, you're looking at my chest. I've gotta tilt your chin, and now that I've got you looking up at me, what do I say? Like, this is one I've never been able to solve. Must've asked everyone I know, and I think the general consensus leans towards... [Clare Voiceover] How did this happen? It's just, he was sweet. That whole routine. And I have waited for this for years. Still, I said I wasn't gonna, hang on. Where is he going? Oh no, not the ear. Mm. Not sure this is such a good thing. I think it's time to go to the party. What? -Jamie. -What? Shouldn't we be getting to the party? Oh, I'm happy here. It's just kinda cold. Yeah, you're right. We might come back to that one though, eh? Or not. Hey? What do you reckon? Sure, maybe. Just say when. Nearly done now, Clare. I'm afraid I'm going to need to take a blood sample. Could you tell me, did you have anything to drink last night? A lot or? No, not much. Some. Okay. And did you take any drugs? Yes. * Yeah * [Man] How are you? -[upbeat music] -[people chattering] Hey! Never better. Neil, this is my friend, Clare. -How are you doing? -Glad to be here. Yeah, it's been cool. It's good of you to bring a bottle. Oh yeah, sorry. Are there any around? Try the kitchen. Hang on, Clare. Stay and keep your Uncle Neil company. She's taken, Neil. Look, why don't you get a drink for us? Yeah, sure you'll be okay? Pretty sure. All right, won't be long. You all right? Yeah. Come on, you bastard. What's up, mate? Hey, good, and how'd you get on? You having trouble, mate? Yeah, always. Here, here. Look and learn. Tadah. Thought you said you weren't into her, though. That was then. Isn't she great, mate? Ah yeah, lovely. You jealous? Not me, mate. Sam's here, I'm sorted. Excellent, big night for us both then. So where's Jamie been hiding you then? No, it's not really like that, we're just- -[bell rings] -Hang on. Oh, Jenny. Where have you been all my life? * I said sing it loud * * And with this * * O come all ye faithful * * Joyful and triumphant * * Gather around * * Grab the old blue trumpet * Is that the loo? Get in line. So, how you doin'? I feel a bit shit, actually. I've got a kink in the knees. Medical cure? Thanks. So are you and Ben like a couple? Me and Ben? I don't think so. All right. Actually, if I fancied either of them, it would be Jamie. -Really? -It's true. You're the envy of loads. Well, I'd better go back and try to find her. Where'd you get that beer? I liberated it from the, hey Sam! Get over here. Hey, hey, sports fans. All right, Samuel. [Sam] Come here. Right, guys. Yeah. [reggae music] So Ben's single? Cool. [person knocking] Coming. What about Jamie, though? Well, let's see. * Send me some lovin' * No, really, you know, that's amazing. I love ballet, yeah. Neil, have you seen Clare? No, not recently. Did you put in a good word for me? I'll put in a whole sentence, mate. Anyway, go on, go on, Swan Lake, Wicked. Guys, has anyone seen, bloody hell! Join us, Jamie lad. It's getting interesting. Yes, I can see. Catch. Thanks. * So I can hold it * Hey, ooh, sorry guys. I don't suppose you've seen, no, probably not. * Can you send me your kisses * Hey, Tess. -Have you seen- -In there. Oh, no way. How's she doing? How d'you mean? Well you know, is she happy? She's beside herself. Since when were you this keen? I'm not, I'm just... Oh, hey. Hey, everything all right? As rain. Good, good. Lost you for a bit. I was in there. Yeah, so look, what now? Do you wanna go dance, or we could grab a drink, sit down for a bit, and then dance, or- Whatever. There are other choices. I'm easy. Like, it might be fun to go upstairs. What? Oh no, no, no, just to chill. There are people playing cards and stuff. It's really, you know, very civilised. I'm fine down here, thanks. Yeah, yeah right. You're taking the piss. Well, you must be, it's just ridiculous. I mean, the whole, the idea that I'd... No, I don't believe this. I don't believe you're saying, what that, that I raped her. No way. I'm telling you, no fucking way! [singing in foreign language] Don't get me wrong, I've got nothing against Tony Blair personally, but I will not vote for a man who blow dries his hair! It's Guy, right? Right. You're talking bollocks, Guy. [Jamie laughs] I'll see you in a bit. Do you want me to come with? [singing in foreign language] * Every night we go to * -Sorry. -No worries. * Every night, we go to sleep * Hi. Hi. How you doing? I'm peaking. Yourself? Yeah, I'm fine. So, is our Jamie taking good care of you? Yep, he is. Just felt like a bit of a dance, you know. Well, you've come to the wrong place. Sorry? The dance is in there. Yeah, I know. I was just looking for someone to dance with. Oh, right. Do you feel like dancing at all? Me? I mean, not if you're really comfortable- No, I can move, see? Then let's do it. [upbeat music] * I'm a love man * * Call me the love man * * Ooh baby I'm a love man * * That's what they call me, I'm a love man * * I'm six feet one * * Weigh 210 * * Long hair and purty fair skin * * Long legs and I'm outta sight * * There ain't no doubt I'm gonna take you out * * Oh I'm a love man * * That's what they call me, I'm a love man * * Make love to you in the morning * * Make love to you right now * * Make love to you when you think about it * -Hey, Guy, check it out. -What? Clare over there. * 'Cause I'm a love man * * Ooh baby, I'm a love man * She's hot. That she is. No doubt about it. And you and her actually- [Jamie] Yeah, yeah, yeah, we are. Good work. Gorgeous body. Thanks. Well, I mean- Bloody gorgeous! Yeah. I wouldn't mind getting in there myself. * I wanna take you on 'cause I'm a love man * I'm done for, let's go get a drink. Lead the way. Guess I should go collect her. Fair play to ya, mate. I'll be calling you tomorrow for details. Bottoms up. Only in my dreams. Mm. Christ. That's better. I enjoyed dancing. Well, anytime. That's a really beautiful earring. Yeah, it's not mine actually. What's going on here? Can't leave you alone for a second, can I? [Ben] Hello, lovely. What is it with you and women? Why are you always leading them on? We were just strutting our stuff. Oh, is that right? [Ben] Yeah, she's a better dancer than you. [Sam] Yeah, well everyone's a better dancer than me. Sam, this is Clare. -Hi, how you doing? -Fine. Great, yeah. So listen, nice to meet you. You don't have to go. No, I mean, I should find the guy I came with. Who'd she come with? Jamie, there you are. Did you miss me? Of course. You ready to dance yet? Yeah, yeah, if you want. Great, let's go. Hang on, what about? [sultry music] * This girl I know * * Needs some shelter * * But she don't believe * * Anyone can help her * * She's doin' so much harm * * Doin' so much damage * * You don't want to get involved * * You tell her she can manage * * And you can't change the way she feels * * But you could put your arms around her * Oh, she was into him, no doubt. Well, we talked about it. They were together all evening, and then they left together. Why wouldn't they? Look, I'm gonna head home. Yeah, you're probably right. We're done here. No, no, you don't have to. You just stay and hang out here with your mates. No, I've got to see you to your door. There's no need. Are you kidding? My mum would never forgive me. Actually, I didn't really notice. You know, I was slightly indisposed. [upbeat music] Night, Neil. [Neil] But when they went past me on the way out. Have fun, matey. You know, there certainly didn't seem to be any problem. He wasn't even gonna ask her to the party. Changed his mind, I guess, but well, she wanted to go. And on the way, they stopped for a bit in the park. She tell you that? And the party was, you know, it was loose. Drink, stuff, you know. Clare was up for all of it, fact. [engine roaring] So. -Yeah. -Strange night. Yeah, up and down. So, look- Any danger of a coffee? Go on. Just coffee, yeah? Oh god yeah, just coffee. Nothing else? Well, a bit of milk would be good. -No- -And some sugar, if you've got any. Jamie. But if not, you know, it's fine. Yeah, I got some sugar. Ideal. I tried. And before we went up, I tried to say, to tell him that there wasn't gonna be any. You know, I wanted it to be clear. And it should've. And maybe he pretended not to understand. But I did tell him. When we went up, I'm not gonna lie. We went up for coffee. But it's a code. It's accepted. We all know, we all know what it means. I'll put the kettle on. No rush. I read this. Yeah? Haven't really started. Don't bother is my advice, bored me shitless. So have you got nice neighbours, then? There's just this girl. She's not around a whole lot. Right. [Clare] Seems okay. You comfy down there? Yeah, I'm fine. So whereabout exactly is your house? It's pretty much the opposite side of town. You should've said! Must take you a while to get into lectures. Who goes to lectures? -[water burbling] -[kettle clicks] That's the kettle. I'll grab some milk. Okay. [thunder rumbling] Nearly out. You want sugar, yeah? Yeah, two please. Magic. Ow, hot. Sorry. No no, my fault. Can we have some music? What you got? They're all pretty old. There must be something. Yeah, but it's kind of late. Well don't stress, these places have got thick walls. Ah, here we go, here we go. This'll do. [R&B music] I wasn't scared. Not then, not at all. It didn't occur. Maybe it should've done, but it didn't. I mean, it's gonna sound stupid, but I'd known him for years. -Where? -It was definitely blue. It was green. Balls, I saw it! Listen, I was the one who painted the bloody dog. Yeah, my dog. Big green stripe down its back. Looked great. Maybe you're right. I bet you remember shouting at me. Did I? Believe it. I thought I just ignored you in those days. You did that, too. Sorry. Well? It won't happen again. Time to make your move. How was your coffee? Yeah, lovely. Have you finished? No, not quite. Come on, say it. I think I'm gonna crash out now. There. Course. Yeah, absolutely. It's just I got this class tomorrow. Say no more. Now or never. Go on. Kiss her. So listen, thanks for everything. It's been a really great evening. Yeah. Hang on. We'll do it again, definitely. Clare, the thing is- I've got your number now. I'll give you a call? -Leave. -Yeah, do that. Sleep well, Jamie. And you. Talk to you soon? [Jamie] Yeah. [ominous music] Fuck! What went wrong? Now where'd you blow it? Something must have gone eggy. You shouldn't be walking away with a hard on. You were cruising. I mean the party, back for coffee, sorted, easy. Music, chat, romping it all night. Then what? It was just a bit sudden, standing up and stuff, the door. Those goodbyes. You missed your moment is all. Happen to anyone. * The earth spins * [Jamie Voiceover] That's a joke. In fact right now, she's wishing she had the guts. * One man struggles while another relaxes * * There's a hole in my soul * [Jamie Voiceover] I bet she hasn't gone to bed. I bet she's waiting. * The world is out to gather just by gravity * [Jamie Voiceover] Yeah, waiting and hoping that you'll come back and actually follow through. Hit the mark. So give her what she wants, go back, and this time, make it happen. [rain pattering] [Jamie knocking] Yeah, what? Who is it? [Jamie] It's me, Jamie. [water trickling] What's wrong, Jamie? You couldn't lend me a small canoe, could you, to get me home? -It's raining, right? -No shit. -You're soaked! -Well, it's me wet look. You like? Could catch on. Honestly, you spend hours doing your hair. I know the problem. Isn't it a bitch? So, hello again. Hi. Sorry to disturb. No, that's fine. You couldn't lend me a towel, could you? Sure. Cheers. You haven't got like a dressing gown or something, have you? I'm wet through. One with flowers would be good. I haven't got flowers, but it is pink. Oh, pink's great. Hand over immediately. By the time you're dry, the rain will have eased. There's bound to be plenty of cabs. Now that is definitely what I call pink. What do you reckon? Is it me? Say it's me. It's you. Sexy as all hell, eh? Anyway, like I said, I was just brushing my teeth. Oh go, don't let me stop you. If it's all the same to you, I'm just gonna crash on this. I'll be really quiet. You won't even know I'm here. All right, but no snoring. Well if I do, you can join in. Be like a duet. -Hang on. -I've got to change. Well, I'm not sorted here. Makes it easier. Have you got a blanket or something? Got a coat. Better than nothing. Cheers. [Jamie grunting] [Jamie shivering] Gah, now this. This is really fuckin' uncomfortable. [Clare giggles] No, it is. -Go to sleep. -Well, you try it. I'm turning the light out. -No, not yet. -I'm tired! So you said. Well, then. Actually, this takes me back to my school days. All I need is for Julian Barrow to start wanking in the bed next door. No fear of that. [rain pattering] This is nice. Chatting like this. Who's chatting? I'm going to sleep. [Jamie] Yeah, me too. Glad to hear it. -Clare. -Goodnight. Night. Clare? [Clare] Yeah? Sleep well. And yourself. -Clare! -What? I'm about to die of pneumonia. Just this coat, you know? That's all there is. Yeah, but wanna go top to tail? I don't think so, Jamie. No, no, you're right, bad idea. My feet probably stink. So can I get in with you? Look, you said- All right, all right, all right, forget it. Good. You know, I'll just lie here freezing my ass off, contracting some fatal disease. It's really nothing for you to worry about. Look, do you want the duvet and I'll have the coat? Interesting plan, but I think I can see the flaw. Well what, then? It's not that big a deal, Clare. You know, I'm just suggesting we both keep warm. But hey, if it bothers you, then. Doesn't bother me. So where's the problem? Come on, get in. But I warn you- And I warn you, you even think of hogging the duvet, and I'll- -Don't push your luck. -Who, me? Ah. Have you got enough room? Yeah, loads, look, come back a bit. -You're falling out. -I'm fine. -No, no, no, come back. -I'm comfortable. Good. I'm warm now. Oh, was that your foot or mine? -Jamie. -Sorry, sorry. Just kidding. [Jamie sighs] What are you doing? Saying goodnight. Same to you. Did you wash your hair recently? It smells nice. [Clare sighs] I'll turn the light out now. When you're ready. I'm ready. Just warning you, I've gotta move my arm. Right. [eerie music] I can hear your heartbeat. What? What's going on? Are you all right, man? You're screaming. Probably woke up the street. Sorry. No worries. I'll let you sleep, eh? Stick around, B. Please. Sure. I'm here. I just don't know really what to say. This never happened to you? [Ben chuckles] What time are you due in court? Nine. Isn't that kind of a relief, after all the waiting? Nope. I didn't do it, Ben. I know, pal. I'm not guilty. I know you're not. [Jamie sighs] You will be lied to. There'll be talk of shades of grey areas, of ambiguity, but what happened on the night of October the 14th is a certainty. You will hear two stories of the events of that evening. Two stories that are unalterably opposed. I would ask you to listen carefully. It is your task to find where the truth lies. So, at 8:45, you opened the door to James Lloyd. That's correct. [Barrister] This was the first time you'd seen him in how long? Two years. And what were your first thoughts on seeing the defendant? [Jamie knocking] Hi. Hi. I was disappointed. -How are you doing? -Good. [Barrister] In what way disappointed? -You? -I'm fine. Excellent. [Clare] I thought he was taller. In, right. Thanks. Before, when I was younger, I'd had a schoolgirl crush on him. When I was younger. I thought she was great. It had been years, and, she'd cut her hair. I just thought she was great, and I knew that she'd always liked me, so, it was going good. Mm, this is more like it. Have a straw. Stay away from the cheese straws. We were both happy. Yes, I was delighted. And the start of the date was fine. I mean, he was nervy and stuff, but we were getting along. But then, when we went to eat, there wasn't even, I mean, we didn't have a whole lot to say to each other. How's your dad? Do you see him ever? Yeah, I see him. Yeah, 'cause Susanne said that- Ah, I don't want to know what Susanne was saying. I was trying to be polite, but at the same time, make it clear. Right, so here's the options. We go to the pub and meet my mates, or, or we could just hang out together a bit more. Pub's good. Well, it's partial, isn't it? I mean, yeah, those are the things that happened. There's no lie. But the way she tells it, like all the signs she's supposed to have given? So listen, when did you cut your hair? Oh. Oh god, ages ago. I like it very much. Well, thank you. They weren't the signs I got. Not at all. You'd be in? Great. * See our friends, see the sights * I wouldn't call that making things clear. [people chattering] We come now to the episode of the park bench. Miss Howard. Why did you kiss James Lloyd? I didn't. I mean, not so much as let him kiss me. Did you not want him to? Had you given him any sign that you did want him to act as he did? I don't know. Come on, Clare we've been through this, it's vital. It's vital that we establish there was nothing in your behaviour- Ah, but there was! Of course there was. Because I did want him to kiss me. I don't need to hear that. Ah, but it's the truth! If I hadn't wanted, I would've told him. However fucking embarrassing, I've been there before. All I'm saying- Just listen, all right? I changed my mind at some point in the evening. That's allowed, yeah? I mean, that's my, surely. I can flirt, I can do whatever, give the guy a fucking blowjob. If I then say no, if I then say that I'm not, that I don't want... It still makes it, it still makes it rape, right? Not to a jury. I know this sounds harsh, but if you admit you changed your mind once, no one can be certain you didn't change it again. I did. [Barrister] Clare! And again, and again. That's how it works, Philip. You know, you go out, you're with someone, they say something great, they laugh, I don't know. And suddenly it's like a light goes on, you fancy them. And then the next minute, something else, and you're not into them anymore. And so on. Eventually, you're decided. I don't want to admit to myself that I ever fancied him. Not for a second. But I did. Listen, Clare. Please, understand me. What you're saying, whether or not it may be true, you can't talk like that. The law can only deal in black and white. There's no such thing. Nevertheless, that is how we must proceed. [people chattering] Why did you kiss James Lloyd? I didn't. I mean, not so much as let him kiss me. [Barrister] You didn't want him to kiss you? No. Then, why didn't you tell him that? I was embarrassed. I just found it really difficult to put him off. [Barrister] Haven't you been in that situation before, fending off unwanted advances? Not where someone, he never gave me a chance. Never asked the question, he just assumed an answer. And what do you think brought him to that assumption? That's not for me to say. I would suggest that it is. I hadn't led him on. I hadn't led him on. Course she thinks it's true, but what she thinks has dick all to do with anything. Repeat a lie for four months, and you'll start believing it. So why lie in the first place? 'Cause she slept with him, and she wishes she hadn't. Tell me you've never been in that bed. -Yeah, but I wouldn't- -Quiet, people. [people chattering] Last place I'd have come. Well, the girl is brave. I'll give her that. That's kind of you. Over here, guys. Aggies at the ready, everyone. Watch yourself. -Hello Clare, how are you? -Hey, Liz. [Woman] I told Clare we had to come out for a drink. -What would you like? -Oh, I'll get them. No, I'm there. -Whatever's fine. -Tomato juice. [people chattering] Well, don't let us stop the conversation. There's only one topic around here. You did good today, I thought. Oh, were you? I didn't notice. We were all there. Thanks. Hey, it was a great show. [Man] This is all they had, all right? Oh thanks, it's fine. [Moira] So, tomorrow. Have you got a problem, Moira? Me? I've got no problem. I just don't believe you, is all. Never have. Why not? Please. Well, what's it matter? It's not me you're trying to convince. It matters. All right. Because you're not stupid, and anyone that genuinely finds themselves in that position would have to be. Please, in your version, when do you think he decided to rape you? At the start of the evening, or after you led him on and then turned him down? She didn't lead him on. She had him up for a coffee, and when he came back, she opened the door to him again, and this time, she let him stay the night. She didn't make him stay on the floor. Instead, she let him into her bed. Into her bed. You did all that, didn't you? Are you seriously trying to tell me you didn't know what to expect? You're way out of line, Moira. Any guys comes up to my room, I make sure I tell him what's gonna happen. [Clare Voiceover] It wasn't that simple. And if I don't, I deserve what's coming to me. That's enough now. It's just my opinion. Let's drop it, all right? Can we talk about something else, is that okay? Fuck this shit. [Philip] And at the party, Miss Howard, how would you describe your behaviour towards the defendant? Just friendly. That was all. I mean, I was grateful that he'd taken me out, and I didn't really know anyone else at first. But then I met a few people, and I was having a good time, and he was part of that, I guess. No, I mean, I should find someone, this guy I came with. But not a big part. Jamie. There you are. So, how about that dance? I'm fine here, actually. Hey, you promised. Oh, go on then, just the one. You must be kidding. I assure you, I'm perfectly serious. What, that I shouldn't have taken her home? There was no need. Miss Howard even suggested to you that you remain at the party. Well yeah, but that's, that's form, isn't it? That's what you're supposed to say. It never occurred to you that it might be the truth? No. Well, it wasn't. -Besides. -Yes? I mean, I had plans. Indeed you did. Don't put words in my mouth. She had the same plans. [Philip] Or so you thought. Listen, we'd been dancing. [sultry music] She led me out there, onto the floor. All around us, couples were getting off. It was, we started to dance. It was great. * This girl I know * * Needs some shelter * Obviously, after that, I was going to take her home. The tampon had been forced some way up into the vagina. There are several possible explanations for this. Embarrassment, the complainant may simply have forgotten to remove it, or may have chosen not to. This is uncommon, but not unknown in cases of spontaneous and vigorous sexual intercourse. Alternatively, it could be taken as evidence of forcible entry. It should be noted that further examination showed no evidence of internal damage to Miss Howard. A sample of blood was taken. Tests revealed a low percentage of alcohol, and traces of marijuana. The amounts indicated would probably have had some effect, although certainly falling short of outright intoxication. There was some evidence of bruising around the inner thighs. Could this merely be the result of vigorous intercourse? Yes, I suppose I would have to say that it could. Are you sure you've had sufficient? I'm fine, Mum. You hardly ate a thing. I'll do a proper shop before I go, fill up these empty cupboards. I wouldn't bother. Why not? Well, there might be no need. We'll give Gran a ring later, tell her how it's going. How is it going? [Mum] I know she'd appreciate a call from you. Mum. How is it going? Can I make myself a coffee? [Jamie] Help yourself. I know I shouldn't really have one now. It's bound to stop me sleeping. I keep trying to cut down, but, ah. Your father always used to say that, your father always used to say that- Mum. Tell me you didn't do it, Jamie. Why? You've heard me every day. You've sat in there and heard me tell my side. That isn't quite the same thing. Well, I shouldn't have to convince you as well. I know. But I'm very much afraid that you do. All right, then. I did not rape Clare Howard. I am in hell for something I absolutely did not do. Why would she lie? I don't know. Honestly. I made all the running. You know, I accept that. You know what I'm like. I can run too fast. I wouldn't let the date end. I joked my way back into her room, thinking that it would all work out, and it did, you know? Because in the end, when the lights were off, Clare and I had sex, Mum. She consented. It wasn't great, by any means. Quick and... And afterwards, we both lay there and we didn't talk. It wasn't, it wasn't comfortable for either of us. [Jamie sighs] So after a bit, when she slept, I got up and I left, which is wrong. I know. And which I regret. So much. [Jamie sighs] And I guess when she woke up, she hated what she'd done, and I guess hated me. And there was, there was just something in her head that, I don't know what else I can say. Sorry, Mum. But what I really need from you right now is support. I don't think you understand. You do have my support. Whatever you do, you'll always have that. I'm your mother. [Barrister] You've told the court, Ms. Howard, that you felt the defendant was reluctant to leave your room. [Clare] That's correct. [Barrister] How reluctant? He, I guess not really. It wasn't difficult to make him go. [Barrister] How did you make him go? I shut the door on him. [court murmuring] You shut the door on him? Yes. [Barrister] That must've been a relief. It was. So why did you open it again 10 minutes later? It was raining. -[rain pattering] -[Jamie knocking] What, who is it? [Jamie] It's me, Jamie. [water trickling] What do you want, Jamie? [Jamie] It's pissing down outside. It is? Sure, I'm soaked. [rain pattering] Please, Clare. [door creaks] Oh, thanks. It's fine. So, can I come in and dry off? Just for a minute, towel's over there. Cheers. Really, raining like a bitch. So. Hello, again. That is an outright lie. It was, I wish I could, truly, it was nothing like that. [Jamie knocking] Oh, what, who is it? [Jamie] It's me, Jamie. -[water trickling] -[rain pattering] Hey, you're soaked! You couldn't lend me a small canoe, could you, to get me home? Give you a towel, will that do? Be a start. [door slams] I shouldn't have let you go out in that. Well, now she tells me. So, hello again. I was really tired by now, just worn out. It had been a long night, and he was back in my room. You haven't got a dressing gown, have you? Why? 'Cause I'm wet through. [Clare] And I didn't want him there. She was like, I won't say undressing me, but not far from it. There was contact. Pink dressing gown, love it. It's you. And I tried to stay on the other side of the room. Anyway, like I said, I mean, I was just brushing my teeth. Well, we were dancing round, you know? Couldn't make the first move, so I started sorting out my bed. So if it's all the same to you, I'm just gonna crash on this? I don't think that's such a good thing. Well, I'll be really quiet. You won't even know I'm here. [Clare] And I didn't know what to say. She was chuffed, definitely. Not too quiet, I hope. I had to, I still had to undress. Hang on. I've gotta change, Jamie. She was standing in front of me. He said he needed the light on. She waited until she had my attention. I tried to make sure he wasn't looking. She wanted me to see her. We are not going top to tail, Jamie. We're not going top to tail, Jamie. Come on, get in. All right, get in. But I warn you. Have you got enough room? Come back a bit, you're falling off. Are you comfortable? I'm fine. I'm comfortable. What are you doing? Saying goodnight. Same to you. Turn the light out. I'm turning the light out now. When you're ready. [rain pattering] I can hear your heartbeat. I can hear your heartbeat. [people chattering] I was thinking last night, about all this. This shit. 'Cause I'm clear how it started. He took my choice away, that night. That's what he did. And since then, every step, everything that's happened has been my choosing, all mine. I mean, I asked. I demanded to come here. To get him back. To make him fucking suffer. But also, to try and give myself some kind of control. People warned me, how it would be, and what I'd have to face, and they didn't know the half of it. And you read that most women, and I understand why they don't report, but you know, you've got to. So whatever happens now, and whatever they decide, is not gonna make me regret it. [Woman] Well, soon be over. It won't. I've still gotta get up tomorrow. And day after. It doesn't end. [people chattering] As the verdict was announced to loud cheers from the public gallery, James Lloyd remained impassive, only a clenched fist betraying his emotions. And so ends a case that will call into question once again the failure of the prosecution to prove- -Mr. Lloyd, Mr. Lloyd! -Mr. Lloyd, Mr. Lloyd! Can we have a few words, please? Please, I don't wanna answer any questions. I'm gonna read this statement, and then you can all piss off. This case has been a nightmare for myself and those close to me, and I am of course delighted that my name has been totally cleared. I would like to thank everyone who has stood by me through this difficult time, especially my family and friends. [Clare sobbing] I very much hope now to be allowed to resume a normal life, and to be able to continue my studies. Finally, I would like to express the sincere wish that my accuser resolves whatever problems she has. Thank you very much, indeed. Now like I said, you can all piss off. [Paparazzo] Mr. Lloyd, just one more question, please! Just wanted to ask you, how do you feel about Miss Howard now this has been passed? [cameras clicking] [engine revving] I can hear your heartbeat. I said I can hear your heartbeat. -Clare. -No. Come on, you're killing me. I said no. I really need you. Jamie! [Clare gasping] -I'll be gentle. -Jamie! -I'll be really gentle. -Fucking get off me! Fucking get off me! [sombre music]
