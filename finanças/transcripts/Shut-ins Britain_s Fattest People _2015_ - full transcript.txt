I think my belly button is somewhere underneath this lump down there, somewhere. HE GROANS NARRATOR: Confined within the four walls of their homes... At the moment I do nothing, I just exist. ...and addicted to food... I know it is a mega amount but I still want to eat it because it makes me feel good. These are just three of Britain's estimated 50,000 people who are super morbidly obese. The reasons people get that big, it's not just simple gluttony and laziness. I obviously don't want to be like this, I hate being like this. Their weight is putting a strain on their health... I go to bed and worry that I won't wake up. ...and their loved ones. Nah nah nah nah nah. No, no, just for... No, bollocks to you. My little girl is in there somewhere but she's stuck in this big body. You shouldn't have to look after your mum, your mum looks after you. - Now all three have the chance to save their lives and their relationshi - ps. I just want to get the weight off and get out. This surgery is a lifelong non-reversible procedure. And I think this is her last chance. But the road ahead isn't going to be easy. Is it hurting? Yeah. Sit down again. I feel like I'm never going to be able to eat properly ever again cos I can't even drink without being sick at the moment. Northamptonshire has a rugged rural charm and the space to roam free. - But the joys of the British countryside are wasted on single mum Emily - . At just 24 years old but already weighing 26 stone, she is super morbidly obese and is binge eating herself to death. Some days I do eat all day, non-stop, but most of the time it's sort of big binge in the morning, a light afternoon then a massive binge again in the evening. Emily is just one of a growing number of young adults who are putting their health at risk through over-eating. Forty per cent of 16-to 24-year-olds in the UK are now obese or overweight. Normally if I get a breakfast, it will be a breakfast muffin with sausage and egg in it, I get breakfast wraps and then I get about five or six hash browns and a chocolate milkshake. No one really knows how much I eat and I do generally just eat it on my own. When I'm eating I'm on a bit of a high, I'm happy, in my little zone. But once it's gone, I'm sort of out of that straightaway and it's back to sort of reality again. Emily is hooked on a deadly diet of high fat, high sugar and high salt junk food. A single day of binge eating can exceed 15,000 calories. Over ten times the recommended daily amount. When I eat like this, I do sort of feel a bit disgusted with myself, but if I'm on my own and there's no one watching me then I've got no one else to judge me so I just get on with it. I always say to myself, one more binge and that's it, I'll be really good and start losing weight and it never happens. There's never been a last binge, not yet. Done! Mission accomplished. SHE LAUGHS Hiding her relationship with food within her home, Emily now actively avoids the outside world. If I get asked to go out, I'm like, what reason can I think of to say no? I do feel judged and feel like people look at me and see a big fat ugly person cos that's how I feel. EMILY: Thank you. Shut in by her crippling social anxiety, modern technology means she can feed her junk food addiction without ever leaving her house. So we've got chocolate mini rolls, pain au chocolate, I don't know, pastries with chocolate in. My chocolate fudge icing that I'll spoon out. That won't last me the whole week, that'll be gone within a few days. My fingers are tightening up against the side. I start getting all like this. It's food, for God's sake. Sort of the feeling that I can't wait. I just need to eat it now. Like... Yeah. And Emily's number one food to binge on is just one click or call away. I love takeaway, that is my favourite, I love it. I could have it every night of the week if I could. So I have a bit of salad on there. I don't use the whole box but I do like a little bit on my kebab. When I went to the doctors about my weight, that's when I found out that my body consists of over 50 per cent fat but cos I can't see what's going on inside, I block it out. Ready, spin. Emily had her first child at 20 and her second at 22, gaining more weight with each pregnancy. Mummy just go sit back down for a minute, OK? But with Riley now four and Harry nearly two, she's finding it hard to be the mum she wants to be. Riley is starting to notice now that I'm struggling. "Your belly is like a bouncy castle," he says to me. He notices now. I don't want him to notice things like that. Day-to-day life is becoming increasingly difficult. I find it so hard to put shoes on, any shoes on. I have to always shift my whole body just to try and get each foot in. And her 24-year-old body is rapidly aging due to the excess weight. I went for an X-ray on my back and it said I had the deterioration on my spine of a 60-year-old woman. I haven't got a life at the minute. It's not a life, I'm just existing. Emily's weight isn't just damaging her body. Hiya, you all right? Yeah, good, thank you. Hello, bud. Last year her relationship with partner Jonny broke down. They remain close but now live separately. Me putting on weight has definitely changed a lot of things. I don't want to be intimate, not because of him, I love him, but cos of how I feel. Once I've got my confidence back, I can be confident in my relationship again, and then I'm hoping we can grow closer again, be back to normal, be my old self again, cos I'm not who I used to be. This has changed me. See you later. She don't think that I love her but I still love her to bits. I worry about her. I don't want her to end up having a heart attack and dying. Emily's parents have also been worrying about her for years. That's a nice one of her there. Dad Steve and mum Toni noticed Emily's unhealthy relationship with food from a young age. She was a little bit chunky there. Mm. I would say probably around six and eight, we realised that there was an extra packet of crisps going out the cupboard each day. We had to start hiding them away. We could hear the cupboards going at night. - We knew she was trying to raid 'em. We'd have to jump on her pretty quick - ly. Her favourite thing was, "I'm full up, I can't manage any more dinner. Can I have my afters now?" And then she'd go back and start picking at her dinner afterwards. Emily left home and moved in with boyfriend Jonny when she was 17. Now there were no restrictions on how much she could eat. I was about a size 14 when we met, so he has literally seen me go from my smallest to my biggest. We would sit there and we'd just sort of have our dinner, then we'd sit there and like, "Shall we get a pizza?" And then we'd order a pizza after our dinner so it was like a second dinner. Despite her fears about leaving her home, Emily visits her parents' house once a week. DOORBELL RINGS Hiya! You all right? Come in. Thank you. STEVE: So how good have you been this week, truthfully? 50-50. What did you have? Chinese. Go on then. I had a chow mein, salt and chilli chicken, chips, curry sauce, spare ribs. You ate all that on your own? Yes. You can't carry on like that. I know. But do you know? Yeah. Of course I know. It's just I find it hard. I obviously don't want to be like this, I hate being like this, it ruins my life, I hate it. Stick to a diet. Yeah? No more takeaways. I know. They are quite hard on me with things. A lot of it comes from a good place and they're just trying to help, but in my head it's like, just leave me alone, stop it, - then I'll come home and eat cos I'm just stressed out about the conversati - on. In contrast to Emily, dad Steve and her 14-year-old twin brothers Will and Joe are super-fit exercise fanatics. My brothers are all into fitness, they're all slim, and I'm obviously not, which is hard. I feel very sort of like a black sheep. And it sort of makes me feel he's really proud of them (VOICE BREAKS) but not of me, and I get that, I understand, but it is really hard to see. - Steve has used every trick in the book to motivate his daughter to lose weight - . We've tried loads of things over the years, with all the exercise stuff and all the various slimming groups, the diet plans we've done for her. We tried bribing her with an iPhone, and that was great for the first week, she stuck to the diet, and then went off the rails and then it was cash instead. That lasted for a week or two then went off the rails again, and then we tried to get her on the Couch to 5k - and you think do I want to go out and put my body through running for an ho - ur or do I want to sit down, DVD and a kebab? And that one always won, so this was the problem we had. Emily is stuck in a vicious cycle. She hates how big she is but the only thing that comforts her is more food. Put the chips on the bottom. The chow mein on top of that and then curry sauce goes on. It smells really nice. SHE LAUGHS Over the last seven years, Emily's gained nearly 15 stone, more than doubling her weight. Looking at it, I know it is a mega amount of food, but I still want to eat it cos it makes me feel good. If she continues binge eating at this rate, by the time she's just 30, she'll be almost 40 stone and that will mean she'll be completely stuck in. What's the date today? Oh, don't. Dad Steve is desperate for things to change. It's all healthy stuff but none of it's been eaten. I see a sad young girl and I can see in her eyes that she's not, she's not happy. So why are these in here then? What have you done to earn them? Nothing. My little girl is in there somewhere. She wants to come out but she's stuck in this big body. What's this for? Chocolate fudge icing? That's stuff you put in cakes, you eat that straight out the tub? Mm-hm. With a spoon. That's just pure fat and sugar. I know. Wow. We're pretty much worried to death. She's on our mind every single day about where it could end up. It's an addiction, I mean, she is addicted to food and I'm desperate for her to get help. I can... I can see her not being here in ten years' time. Sweet dreams, night night. Emily's bingeing is putting her relationships, her children's future and her life at great risk. I just feel like I haven't got the control and that scares me. - Even though I am the person that can control myself and the only person that ca - n, I feel like I'm not and that really frightens me. Twenty-four-year-old single mum Emily is so ashamed of her body that she has become shut in. Weighing over 26 stone, she has a binge-eating addiction which has taken over her life. - Sometimes while I'm waiting for it to cook, I'll eat a few packets of crisps as wel - l. After this I'll probably see what something sweet I can find. That's my breakfast. Just makes me feel calm, relaxed. I forget about everything bad just while I'm eating it. Even though I am the person that can control myself, and the only person that can, why can't I stop? Unable to stick to diets and gaining over two stone in weight every year, Emily is desperate for her life to change. I go to bed and worry that I won't wake up. And that scares me cos I wanna be here for the boys. I don't wanna have them lose their mum. So today, she's venturing out of the house with Jonny to meet one of Britain's leading bariatric surgeons, Mr Sherif Awad. Emily wants to explore the possibility of a surgical solution to her weight problems. She is 24, she's in the prime of her life and she is trapped and imprisoned in her body. That's 164.8 kilograms. OK. For a young person, and I see this a lot in my patients, they are ashamed to be walking into that consultation room asking for an operation. Come on in. Thank you. Have a seat. Thanks. Hello! I think if we became a less judgmental society and just gave patients a chance to improve their health, that's all they're looking for. Emily's weight is putting her in dangerous territory. So with you being BMI 62, you've gone beyond super obesity and you are now super super obese. You're at a stage now where all the evidence out there shows us that the only thing which is going to help you to achieve effective weight loss is a surgical operation. So at present your obesity has probably reduced your life expectancy by about 10 to 15 years. You are at huge, huge risk of developing heart disease, blood pressure, having a heart attack. Your risk of diabetes is almost 20 fold higher, purely as a result of your weight. So this isn't something that's benign, it isn't something that should be overlooked and certainly I would not want to see you gain weight after today. This isn't news to Emily but hearing it from a surgeon may be the wake-up call that she needs. To get these young patients in early, that for me is much more preferable than waiting until they turn up to the clinic with a whole host of obesity-related medical problems. No young mother wants to hear that she is expected to die so early. That's time she could be spending with her children and grandchildren in fact. When you hear it from a professional, it makes it more scary when they tell you are going to die if you carry on the way you are. It does give you the motivation to do something. Ah! Oh, thank you! To help Emily make sense of what is driving her to eat, she'll be having regular sessions with clinical psychologist Laura Keyes. I think for most people there's a really high level of shame that's linked to any kind of addictive-type behaviour. If you haven't had a struggle around some kind of addiction, it can be really hard outside that to understand that cycle that somebody is stuck in. Anxious about leaving her house, Emily's first session will be in the safety of her own four walls. But Laura's visit is making her nervous. I feel safe in here. Nothing makes me feel bad when I'm in here. As soon as I know someone else is coming round, I start to panic. I feel like they might come in and start judging me and my house, and it all starts all going like that again, like being outside all over again if someone comes inside. Hello. Hi! Laura? Yeah. Come in. Yeah. Nice to meet you. LAURA: Where would you like to start? Erm... I'm a mum of two children. Their dad still is in picture but he doesn't live with us so that gets a bit hard sometimes and that's where some of my stress comes sometimes and stress always leads to my problem, which is food. It's not just a little bit of food, it's always a lot of food. It's all just a way of pushing away the feeling, I guess. Yeah, when I'm eating, I'm in my little bubble. Nothing can hurt me or upset me at that time cos I'm happy and I'm just doing what I'm doing. Why is it important, do you think, for you to manage these feelings better and be able to have the surgery? What's that for? I just... I don't want to start crying. I just want my life to be better again. I don't feel like the same person as what I used to be. I want to be able to feel comfortable going out again. I can't do as much as I'd like to do with the kids. Then I worry about my weight, I worry about my health. I can't just die on my kids, they need me. Yeah. So I guess it sounds like what would be helpful for us to focus on is how to deal with the feelings that are there. There's stress but there's also anxiety, and there's also worrying thoughts that are there. Yeah. Part of the work is about teaching her how to be kind to herself, to get back to socialising. Just helping her connect back in with the world rather than being quite stuck and quite isolated, which is where she is at the moment. Emily will need to learn to break her destructive pattern of eating. My relationship with food is all to do with negative emotions. If I feel bad, that makes me feel better, so it's a weird kind of relationship, I don't like it. Well, I like it but I don't want it to carry on any more. Determined to change her life, Emily's booked another appointment with Mr Awad and is taking Jonny and her mum Toni along for support. She wants to have the bariatric surgery that would see the size of her stomach more than halved, reducing forever the amount of food she'll be able to eat. TONI: I just want her to be happy. I know she'd be happy if she was smaller and I'd love that for her. I think she knows that this is her last chance. But Mr Awad is still concerned about Emily's addiction to food. For Emily, if she doesn't change her dietary habits and her lifestyle, she will not be a candidate to go forward to surgery. The main problem is the binge eating, and if she's bingeing a couple of times a day on most days, she's not gonna be able to do that after surgery. It's so vital that you make changes going forward literally from today. The sweet and chocolate cupboard, that's got to go. Yeah. You will not be able to binge eat any more. I'm prepared for that, I'm so prepared to just... I am. I am. OK. An operation is you making changes for life, OK, so it isn't just a quick six month target, you've lost the weight and you go back to your bad eating habits. This is you working with your operation, which is your tool to support you for the rest of your life. Yeah. To convince him that she is a suitable candidate for surgery... Hi. Do you want to come through? Yes. ...Emily will have to prove to him that she can stick to a rigid diet over the next five weeks. The first part of the diet involves no solid food at all. - So for the three weeks that Mr Awad is suggesting that you follow liquid-only die - t, we're aiming for three of these meal replacement products per day. A breakfast, lunch, dinner pattern. It needs to be less than 250 calories per portion and it needs to be around 15 grams of protein. I don't want to see any more bingeing. If she doesn't implement the changes, if she continues to binge, if she puts on weight, the operation's off. Back at home, Emily is facing reality. Cherry Bakewells. Her secret stash has to go. This is the hardest to let go of, I think, but I know it's not good for me. I'm really determined to prove myself. I'm not sitting here thinking it's going to be easy but I'm still determined to push through and do it, definitely. EMILY: Can I make an order for delivery, please? Can I please have a special curry with fried rice, chips with salt and chilli, and spare ribs with salt and chilli, please. Emily may have decided to clear the cupboards but she's putting off starting her diet for one more day. I'd quite like a last Chinese. There's a little bit of sadness knowing this is my last one, but I'm more happy than sad cos I'm excited about starting my new diet tomorrow. OK... I'm doing this for a reason, I'm doing it to prove to everybody that I can stop the bingeing, I can stop the takeaways, and that I can manage something completely new. Over the next five weeks, she will have to find the strength to resist her demons. She's got a huge opportunity to be given her life back and you've had to get rid of resorting to food to get that emotional relief and emotional satisfaction. That is tough. Food is her friend and I've asked her to let her best friend go. Super morbidly obese 24-year-old Emily weighs 26 stone and has been binge eating herself into an early grave. Desperate to change her life, she's on the path towards bariatric surgery and has been restricted to a low-calorie liquid diet. It's just a drink, isn't it? Normally I'm eating loads of food. It's fine, it's day one. I'm feeling positive. I can't say how I'll be feeling at the end of the first week but right now I'm feeling OK about it. To prove that she can control her eating habits, she will have to lose at least a stone before her next appointment with her surgeon Mr Awad. EMILY: Riley, stop. HE CRIES That was not very nice. Say sorry. Only a few hours into her new diet, single mum Emily is struggling. Go and sit down, your dinner's ready, go on, sit down. I'm going to get dad to come round if you don't stop. THEY SHOUT AND LAUGH I'm not having the best day. I feel a bit stressed and upset. I feel drained. The stress that I feel that I want to eat this, want to eat that, but knowing I can't... Normally a day like today I'd just go and get a takeaway later but knowing I can't even do that. Emily is starting to realise the enormity of what lies ahead. (CRIES) It's just so hard. I knew it was going to be hard but it's really hard and I don't see any light at the end of the tunnel at the moment. I just feel like I'm never going to be able to eat again. Already struggling to stick to her liquids-only diet, today Emily faces a new challenge. Her psychologist Laura Keyes has asked her to leave the safety of her house for their next session. At the moment, my goal is to show that I'm ready to have the surgery done and that's why it's so important that I have to try and put some of my fears away and just try and get on with it for me, not anyone else, well, the boys, but it has to start with me. LAURA: So, this is our first time meeting in this setting. I don't know how you feel about being somewhere new. I feel OK but obviously being somewhere like here, I have been thinking of food the whole time in the back of my mind. That is because it has been your coping strategy since childhood, it's kind of been the thing that you go to and I guess some of that is what we need to unpick together. There is something else that has recently, only in the last couple of days sort of surfaced again. OK. Take your time, take some deep breaths, OK, there's no rush. Take your time. I was in a relationship and I think it was bad, it was horrible. Erm... He really got into my head in a bad way. And I always sort of think that hasn't helped with how I feel about people now. Yeah. And it sort of gets to the point where I even ask Jonny, is this OK? And he's like, why are you asking if that's OK? Because some of that stuff is still there. I wonder how long that's been around, that sense of other people are the ones who know what's right for me. Has that sense been there or just, you know... I know what's right for me. I've still not fully got that back yet. Yeah. I still have to ask. There is a tendency to let other people tell Emily what she's about and who she is and be sort of controlled by people in that way. So perhaps she needs to figure out a bit more who she is and what she's about. EMILY: Riley! Your dinner's nearly ready. While trying to stick to her 800 calorie a day liquid diet, Emily has to fight temptation at every turn. I have to blow it and touch it on my lips to make sure it's cool enough, so it's always near my mouth as well. I'm very agitated, I'm very fidgety. I can't relax. For some reason today has left me really, really wanting takeaway. Today is Harry's second birthday party. There is food everywhere. There's pizza, there's sausage rolls, sandwiches. If I wasn't doing this diet or anything right now, I would be eating it all day, picking at it, and whatever's left over tonight I would have just scoffed. Literally. Her next appointment with Mr Awad is looming and Emily is trying to focus on what is at stake. If I do carry on the way I was going, I'd have a shorter life so I'm doing this for them just so they can have me in their life for a lot longer than what they would have. Her fears about her health are finally translating into a newfound resolve. Harry, ah! I could have this life-changing surgery done. I'm going to be healthier. I want to be able to move around more. So the kids will have more fun. It's going to absolutely change everything and I can't wait. One more! THEY CHEER Anxious to lose enough weight so she can have the bariatric surgery, Emily is adding exercise to her diet plan. I don't know, I'm just worried about how much I can manage. If I'm going to be completely honest, apart from running after the kids, this will be the first proper day that I've done any exercise yet. Dad Steve, a qualified boxercise instructor, has arranged a private class with close family and friends. She knows we're there to support her, there's no reason why she can't do it. She's got me, she's got her brothers, we're all fairly well trained in various aspects of fitness and exercise. I want to see her out of breath. I want maximum effort off of her. Start off with a little warm-up. Just a little one. And you're doing sideways star jumps up to the wall. And then repeat the whole process again. MUSIC PLAYS OK, let's go. A maximum effort workout isn't something Emily's body is used to. I do get some chest pains sometimes and I think, oh my God, is this it, is something gonna happen? It scares me, daily. I feel dead. And her dad's tough love means there is no respite. Almost there now, get one more quick one in. No, you won't. OK, have a quick breather. How are we doing? Yeah? SHE CRIES Take it easy, keep walking round, keep moving, deep breaths. Struggling to breathe. I'm sort of ignoring the aches and pains I'm getting but the tightness I'm getting in my stomach and in sort of my throat, I'm struggling to get a full breath in. Get your balance, bring your knee up. It's been a tough session. Undoing the effects of years of over eating will take time and determination. It's been five weeks since Emily started dieting and exercising. She's hoping she's lost enough weight to convince her surgeon Mr Awad that she has put her binge-eating days behind her. I am feeling nervous, it is a massive thing, knowing only one person has that power of decision over something life-changing for me. I just hope I've done enough. Bye, Mummy, bye, Daddy. First, Emily has the weigh-in with dietician Lindsey Parry. She needs to have lost at least a stone to qualify for surgery. So 8.2 kilos, about one and a quarter stones. Is that a good amount in that time? That's brilliant! OK. You're allowed to be pleased with that. OK, I am now, yeah, OK. She has lost more weight than she expected. I think it's huge progress to change a lifetime of mindset in a few weeks so credit to you. I'm surprised at myself, I'm not going to lie. What has done it this time, what pushed you? It's massive. I can't ruin this now. I've got such a big thing to work towards. You are throwing everything at it. Yeah. Good on you. I'm really proud of you. Thank you. The hard work, it's on both sides, really. I can do the operation, not a problem, but you have to put in the work before and after and I think you've done that. I'm really proud of her efforts. She is beginning to tackle her demons and the fact that she's not needed to resort to the comforts that she has resorted to before gives me great confidence for the future. Emily's bariatric surgery is booked for two weeks' time. Now it's going to happen. It's definitely happening. I'm excited now but I don't think it'll feel real until that day. Until the operation, she will have to continue to stick to a low-calorie diet. This will help to shrink the size of her liver. Mr Awad will only be able to perform the surgery if he can move it aside to get to her stomach. I can't even have too much salad so I need to be careful so I'll just do myself four little slices of cucumber, bit of lettuce, some cress and I think that will do. Really fresh tasting. This tastes really lovely, actually, I'm enjoying it. With hopes of a change in sight, Emily is finally daring to think about the future. I'm obviously a little bit nervous as there are risks to any operation. But I'd love to get back to that size, like a 14 or a 16. There's no bingo wings, there's no double chin. I think from knowing that I've had it done, I've got a feeling the self-esteem will start to creep up again from that point, I think, I hope. After two months of battling with her binge-eating demons, Emily is on her way to the Royal Derby Hospital for stomach-reducing surgery. The operation doesn't just give weight loss, they gain in confidence, they gain in self-esteem, they get the respect back, they are given the chance to live the life that they never had. Thank you, thanks for driving. That's it now, we're here, point of no return. I know. STEVE: I'm just really happy that we've got to this day. Little bit nervous but more excited for her. She's knows it's all for a good reason and it's got to be done. MR AWAD: These procedures are not reversible, there is no going back. This is a lifelong change, which requires a lifelong commitment. It's not just about losing weight for the first year and then you live happily ever after. The surgeries we do will change the way you eat forever. I've got a bit of a nervous tummy. I feel a bit sick. It's all just nerves. Are you ready? Yeah. Let's go. If all goes to plan, the laparoscopic surgery will take just under an hour. You'll be all right. Good luck. Thank you. See you on the other side. Huge, huge day, lots of emotions, lots of feelings of guilt and... I guess she feels her life's caught up with her. First Mr Awad needs to be able to lift Emily's liver out of the way so he can operate on her stomach. If it is too big, he won't be able to continue. She's got a beautiful liver so she's worked really hard on the liver diet, liver has shrunken nicely. Here is Emily's stomach. A lot of people think the bigger you are, the bigger your stomach, but actually it's not true, most people have relatively speaking the same size and shape of stomach but it's I guess what they do with it and how much they eat and the pattern of eating that makes the difference. Now he will carefully remove the majority of her stomach, which is normally the size of a melon. So we're using this special gun and this is Emily's sleeve now, so the width of Emily's stomach is roughly going to be the thickness of my thumb. And with that fire, Emily now has a new stomach. That's it. That's three quarters of her stomach out, OK? Emily will no longer have room to binge. She will feel fuller more quickly and be satisfied for longer after she eats. I think she's done absolutely fantastic. The operation went really, really well. Today is the first day the rest of her life. This is it, this is her fresh start that's she's looking for. Emily will be kept in hospital for the next 48 hours, to be monitored for any signs of post-surgery complications. Hi, darling. You in hospital? I am, yeah. Hello. Hiya, you all right? It's the morning after surgery. I'm feeling a lot better now than what I did yesterday. I still don't feel great but I feel a lot better than what I did. Emily is making good progress but Mr Awad wants a last word before she is discharged. I'm expecting you to lose around 10 to 12 kilos in weight, just under two stone over the next six to eight weeks. OK. It's hard work. You're re-learning what to eat, how much to eat. You're going to get it wrong on a few occasions, in terms of eating too quickly, a few episodes of food sticking and feeling uncomfortable and perhaps even vomiting. I don't want too many of those episodes but I'm just warning you to just work hard and bear with it. I've removed her ability to comfort eat. You need that patient to be absolutely in control with how they're going to eat after the surgery. If you don't have control of your eating, then you could rupture your sleeve, and that's potentially a life-threatening illness. It's been two weeks since super super morbidly obese single mum Emily underwent stomach-reducing surgery. With the liquid only part of her post-operative diet over, she now faces two weeks of eating only pureed, protein rich, soft foods. It just looks horrible. It probably tastes fine, it just doesn't look very nice. If you try not to look at it, it just reminds me of cod, chips and curry sauce from the chip shop. SHE LAUGHS That is what I'm having. I thought I'd love this stage but I'm actually hating it. Why couldn't I have stuck to my other diets? Why have I done this to myself? It doesn't feel normal at the moment. I feel like will I ever be able to eat like a normal person ever again cos it doesn't feel like it at the moment. By the time Emily next sees her surgeon Mr Awad, he is expecting her to have lost at least two stone. Although the weight is coming off, it's proving a tricky adjustment period for her. I would love to eat a sausage right now. If I could just eat normally I'd just love to eat a sausage but I'm not going to. SHE LAUGHS Emily's doubting whether the surgery was worth it. And it's only getting worse. I've been poorly in bed all day. I feel sick. I've got awful pains in my stomach. I can't even sip water. Erm... I had a tiny bit of vegetable chow mein last night and a couple of mini spare ribs from the Chinese so I'm guessing this is what's done it to me. I feel awful. Her impulsive Chinese takeaway could have damaged her stomach surgery recovery. Emily is learning a valuable lesson. I didn't think I ever thought I'd have the fear of food ever, and I do at the moment, I'm a bit scared of it. Quite the opposite effect from before I started. It's been seven weeks since Emily's operation and today she is visiting Mr Awad for her first check-up post surgery. Emily, good morning, lovely to see you. Come on in. Thank you. Jonny, welcome, please take a seat. You saw Lindsey this morning? Yes. Very good. How did that go? Really well, I think, yeah. What was the summary? Erm... I've lost... three and a half stone altogether now. Excellent. She said I've lost 22 per cent of my excess body weight. It all seemed to go well. Very good, very good. So you're now literally seven weeks from the surgery. How have they been for you? Very up and down. I did maybe push myself too far on one or two things, which resulted in me being a bit poorly. But I know why and I've learnt from that. Why? I ate... I tried some Chinese, basically, which I know I shouldn't have done and it was stupid. That was how long after surgery? Three and a half weeks. Three and a half weeks, OK. So stupid but I've no desire to try that again or do that again. This operation will not get rid of your emotional cues. No. You will always want that packet of crisps or two packets of crisps. That's not you being hungry for it but that's in your head and your coping mechanism. So you will have a lot of ups and downs. Emotional eating will be hard because if you choose the wrong foods you will get the bad side effects and that's what you experienced over the last seven weeks. Yeah. So the next three months then, OK, they're going to be tough in a different way. And you're trying to cope with the kids and your emotions and your body changes, and getting the confidence to get back out of the house again. You've got your whole life ahead of you now. OK? You've got a chance to in this first year, which is the golden year after weight loss surgery, you can achieve whatever you want to, literally, but you've got to work really hard for it. Yeah. OK. All right. Thank you so much. Thank you so much, thank you for your time. All right, Jonny. OK, bye bye. Emily has a very long journey ahead. The surgery is literally just the start of her journey. She will need a lot of strength to get her through the immediate post-operative phase. So it's early days yet. Three months ago, Emily's life was spiralling out of control as she was binge eating herself to death. Since then, she has started to transform emotionally and physically. It's getting a lot easier, housework, just cos I can move more, without hurting and being out of breath. I feel more springy! I've got more energy. I can do a lot more than what I used to do. It's only been ten weeks since her operation and Emily has already lost four stone. She has reduced her BMI to 52.8 and is no longer classed as super super morbidly obese. I'd love to lose, it sounds massive, but I'd love to lose another 11 stone and I'd be so happy. After years of avoiding the world, Emily at last has the confidence to leave the house and enjoy the great outdoors. It seems like a lifetime ago now where I was shut in before. I think the boys are really excited that we're doing something. SHE LAUGHS Woo! Awesome! High five. Over the last few challenging months, becoming a better mum has remained Emily's main focus. I feel I can make the kids happier than what I used to make them. They've kept me going through this. She is starting to expand her previously shut-in world, enjoying her newfound freedom. Now, change excites me a bit more. I think I'm just sort of embracing it and looking forward to just everything that's happening. And erm... I quite like it. SHE LAUGHS And Emily has found the willpower to undertake her first five kilometre park run. I never imagined I'd do something like this a few years ago, you know. Definitely not. Say come on, Mum! Go on, Mum! Really proud. She'll struggle, she'll moan, but she'll do it. She would never have thought about doing a park run before so it's good to see her taking part. And her new emotional strength is bolstered even more by her dad's immense pride. You're doing brilliant, aren't you? Yeah? Yes! It's all uphill, mind you, but you know. Let's not talk about that! HE LAUGHS I think my family are so happy. I don't feel left out as much any more, and even though I'm not physically the same as them at the moment, I do still feel more belonging now. After today's massive leap forward, milestone, whatever you want to call it. It's fantastic, really, really proud of her. It's completely changed my life. I'm 22 stone and I've just done a 5k park run. It's crazy, it's great, though. I love it. Well done, you done brilliant. Really proud of you. Haven't got to carry you to the car, have I? Might have to. Come on, let's go. No, you done really, really well. Thank you. Subtitles by Red Bee Media
