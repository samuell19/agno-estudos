He's just sitting there, man. You can run around the edge! - I know, right. - That's what... All right, guys. - It wasn't my fault. - Yeah. Hey! We just set a record. It's not a good one. The most points ever scored against this school, and it's halftime. You think that's funny, Mitchell? No, sir. Well, then why are you laughing? You're our captain, elected by these guys. Our only senior. The time for you to make an impression was in practice this week. On the field tonight. Not now. And certainly not on the sidelines, planning a party at your parents' house because you know they're gone this weekend. Pick it up. Brandon, come here. Come here. Yeah, you. I said pick it up. Now hand it to him. Now, we have about five minutes before we have to go out there, in front of everybody who's come here to support us tonight. The question is, what's gonna happen to you now, when you have to go out there, and everybody thinks that you're gonna lay down. Bull...! Get out. Me? I didn't say anything. I said get out. Are you kidding me? Come here, let me take a look at that. Dad, please tell me that you took the wrong exit. Are we in Mexico? No. Shall we go take a look, folks? Come on. Is this really the place? Wow. Who's she? Paint store. First thing tomorrow. Assuming there is one. Julie. What? Let's go find your room, girls. Come on. This place is a dump. Like you care. You'll be at college soon. I'm the one who's gotta live here. I think we're all tired, guys. Why don't we go find something to eat, okay? Sounds great. They gotta have a restaurant, right? Hi. Hello. How are you? Good. We got tacos, tortas, burritos, tostadas and quesadillas. You got burgers? No, we got tacos, tortas, tostadas, burritos, and quesadillas. Tacos. We'll take the tacos, thank you. Okay. What kind of meat do you want? Asada, al pastor, chorizo, cabeza, lengua, jamon? I'll bring you a selection. You can sit wherever you want. Here? I want to watch The Brady Bunch. Yeah. How about it? All right, everybody, just stay with me. - Dad? - Just... Come on, man. Don't be scared, mija. Hey, that's enough. Hold on. Dad! You know what, we're not staying. First thing Monday morning, we're out of here. - Jim. - No, we're not staying here, all right? I'm not having you and the girls stay here. I'll find something else. How? I don't remember there being a whole lot more options. We'll move to Bakersfield. All right? I'll commute. We cannot afford Bakersfield. Okay. Look at us. We're living on a teacher's salary. If you'd just... If we had just stayed somewhere longer, I don't know, built up some tenure, then it would be different. I'm sorry. Babe, you said it yourself. This is the only job you could get. - Yeah. - Right? And our girls, they start that school on Monday. We just gotta make it work. We don't have a choice. Right? I'm so sorry. Jamie, hon, you're gonna do it. Come on, hon. Please don't make me! I know. I know it's hard. Please don't make me! I know it's hard, but you gotta do it, okay? Please, Julie, help me. Hi. I'm here to meet with Principal Camillo. I'm Jim. Jim, the new life science guy. And PE coach, and football. That's right. Maria Marsol. How was the drive in? You like living in Bakersfield? Bakersfield? No. We're... We're here in McFarland. Well, look at you. A little help, please? Certainly don't want a fire in this place. It could cost tens of dollars' worth of damage, right? This is your last chance, son. Make the most of it. Jim White? Principal Camillo. How are you? Decaffeinated. Come on. I'm supposed to bleed a rock with the budget, handle the kids and their petty vendettas, and quit smoking. Who am I, Superman? What happened? Some kid called his little sister a... I'm not gonna repeat what he said, but it explains why she's pregnant. Sit down. Welcome to McFarland. You know, I was surprised that a man like you would want to come here. But then I read your file. Up in Saint Paul, you were fired for verbally abusing your players. I don't use profanity. I was just trying to motivate some boys who didn't know the value of hard work. And a fight with the chairman of the school board? Difference of opinion. And this latest incident. You wanna tell me about that? I lost my temper. It should never have happened. What are the chances of it happening again? It's not gonna happen again. Pleased to hear it. Because you're running out of options, Mr. White. Come in, Coach. Coach White, Coach Jenks. This is your new overqualified assistant. That right? The name's "White"? Yep. Wow. Berdejo. Cardenas. Denas? It's "Cardenas." Diaz. Diaz. Diaz. It's a popular name where you guys come from? We gotta go. Hold on, class isn't dismissed. We gotta go, really. It's our mom. Tell your mother she can wait. You tell her. Hey, White. Is that a popular name where you come from? - Mr... - Puentes. Victor. Mr. Puentes, regular PE class. What do you normally do? - Nothing. - Nothing? Come on, homes. You really wanna mess this up? You wanna get this all sweaty? Real peacock, huh? All right, I'll tell you what we're gonna do. We're gonna... Let's take a lap, we'll call it a day. What about you? I'm not running, jefe. I'm on the football team. That's a linebacker's number. It's not the size of the dog in the fight, coach. It's the size of the fight in the dog. Depends on how big the dog is. Big dog. Huddle up! Huddle up! They aren't really good, are they? Let's give them a chance, hon. Maybe Dad will lose it again and then we'll get to move somewhere else. Stop it. I don't wanna hear another word. Go, Johnny! Hut! Wow. Nothin'! Did you see that hit? All right. Return. Good job, guys! Good hit! Good hit! Nice clean hit. Johnny. Johnny. How many fingers am I holding up? September. What? Look, it's Friday, man, okay? Okay, special teams! No, no, no, no. Sit down. No. You're done. Hey, coach, we only got 10! We need one more! We need one more! Sameniego, get in here! No. I mean it. Sit down. Cortez, let's go. Seriously! What time is it? I'm guessing dawn. - Dad. - What? Wring its neck. Please. I will. Welcome to McFarland. For me? Thank you. Well, I see you kept it. Kept what? Well, knowing where you live, and knowing la Señora Soto as I do, I'm thinking she offered you a chicken. And since you're in here buying feed instead of barbeque sauce, I'm thinking you kept it. Smart move, hombre. It shows you got manners. Thanks, Mr... Sammy Rosaldo. Open every day on Sherwood Avenue since '62. Jim White. Cliff Avenue for about a week, but it sounds like you already know that. I know a lot of things about McFarland. Do you know anything about a plant that can make my garden look better? You don't need a plant. You need a tree. A tree? Sonia! The way that lot faces, the sun's too hot. Fries up your little verduras. Lucky for you, I have a little tree I can sell you. In 5 years, señor, you're gonna have a nice yard with some nice shade. Five years? I don't think so. You know, they got sodas in the store. Water is free, White. How long have you guys been at it? Since five. Five? 5:00 a.m., White. "AM" means morning, ese. Not the radio. Hey, White. Chop and channel your Jeep, glass finish it, crank up the bass, hop up and down... You'll fit right in. Yeah, when pigs fly. Who's the driver? That's Javi. Victor's uncle. He just got out. Out? What do you mean "out"? Out. Victor polished that rig every day Javi was inside. Where's his father? He's still in there. See you later, White. Come in. Right, I wanna get right to this. Coach Jenks tells me that you and he had an altercation at the game. - A what? - An altercation. Well, I wouldn't... I wouldn't call it that. Well, whatever it was, Coach Jenks doesn't think this arrangement is gonna work out, and he's asked for you to step down. Now, I feel that if he's the coach of the football team... Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. You... - You're firing me? - Nobody said you were fired. Well, he just asked me to step down, and you didn't say no, which in my language means you're firing me. - Hold on. - I just moved my family here. Hold on, Jim! I don't have the staff to go around firing people, because some insecure jerk who can't stop eating his apple got all bent out of shape. - What did you... - Shut up! You had a chance to talk and you let me do it for you. You're dismissed. - Am I fired? - No, you're not fired either. Now get out of here. Look, I don't know if this is a pattern with you, and I don't know which one of you was a bigger jerk out there, but I'm counting on it that it wasn't you. Because I need a PE teacher, and I need a life science teacher. I don't know how that sits with you, but that's how it sits. All right, run a lap. Go. Go. Hi, Jamie. Hi. How was school today? It was okay. Can I have half of that? No, but you can have that half. Yeah, you see that, carnal? I was down. How do you like getting smoked? What now, jefe? Run another one. Sure. Wow. They are fast. They are. You want another one? You know, you're in the wrong sport, Sameniego. Not anymore. Coach cut me. You, too, huh? Seriously? You got fired from football? In your first week? All right. Don't rub it in. Congratulations, White. They're treating you like a picker. David, Damacio, Danny. Wake up - it's late. Your father is waiting in the truck. Don't be lazy. The world doesn't wait for you. May God bless you. Thank you, Grandma. David, Damacio - hurry up. Pay attention and respect your teachers. See you later. I hear football didn't work out. You need something to do with all of that spare time of yours? What'd you have in mind? Migrant parent meetings, literacy programs, food banks, support groups. These families need help. No, it's not really... Not really my sort of thing. You live in McFarland, right? You ever taken a look out there? This is one of the poorest towns in America. These kids are invisible, they are expendable. They come from the fields, and they go back to the fields unless the prisons get them first. You notice we got one right next door? Yeah, I... I noticed. Handy, huh? Mr. White, it's pretty clear you don't wanna be here. But for these kids, these are the best years of their lives, and if we're gonna reach them, now is the time. But I guess that's not your kind of thing. Thanks. You're welcome. You know that kid? Yeah, it's Thomas Valles. What do you know about him? Nothing. You like him. No, I don't. She likes him. Get closer. Dad, don't, please. - Can I talk to you a minute? - Yeah. You mind if I shut the door? This requires a shut door? Cross country running. California is holding their first state championship this year. Cross country? That's a private school sport. They breathe different air than we do. No, it's the same air. You do understand we don't have a cross country team? Yeah, what I don't understand is why we have a football team instead. I mean, we have kids here who seem like they can run forever. They carbo-load on rice and beans. I mean, they pick in extreme heat, they go to school all day and some of 'em even run home. I've seen it. - And it's unbelievable. - Yeah. And you've just described half the kids in the Central Valley. Jim, let me ask you something. You've coached cross country before? No. - Track? - No. But you ran? Competed in high school maybe? No. Well, you sound perfect. Why are you following me? Do you know how fast you were going? What are you, a cop? Look, I don't know if this car's speedometer is right, it's an old car, but if it... If it is, you're running almost 12 miles an hour. Means you'd run a mile in five minutes. So? You always run that fast? I don't got a car, all right? - Can I give you a lift? - No. But you can quit following me. These are the times from last year's county meet. And this is where Thomas would be right now. Top 10. Top 10 in the state, and he doesn't own a pair of decent running shoes. Look, Jim, you might be right. But there's too many issues here, the school board being one of them. But if I had board approval, you'd back it, right? Well, yeah, sure, but that's never gonna happen. California public school system pre-approved six new sports a few years ago to get funding for new lockers, including guess what? Cross country. And a cross country coach. Yeah, it says it right here. "Cross country coach." First four runners get one of these... Nice and cold. Get on the line. On your marks... Get set... Go! Johnny, stop bothering those girls and get over here. Yes. I wanna ask you a question. You think the guys in my class would be into cross country? Country western ain't my thing, boss. Cross country running, wise guy. For what? To win, to compete. To impress girls. Nobody wins around here, White. Doesn't have to be that way. I watched you run. You can beat somebody. If I felt like it. Which I don't. What do you say? You want to help me get a team together? How many do we need? Seven. You can start with that knucklehead. Johnny, make sure one of those guys is Thomas Valles. Hey, ese. You wanna be on the running team? Nope. Come on, man. Just think about it. Say yes. Hey! I wanna talk to you guys about a running team. Johnny. You wanna be on the running team? I'll be on the running team. You guys wanna be on the running team? Hey! I got you now, Cardenas. You are this far from juvie, son. Jose. You get me my change? My change got stuck in the machine. I asked Jose to get it out for me. You're not helping them, White. What did you do that for? Congratulations. You just made the cross country team. I told you to stay away from my sister! Thomas, don't do that! Tommy, don't do that! And so did Thomas Valles. Do me a favor, Valles. Act a little happier. The coach just negotiated you out of a suspension. Danny Diaz? Hey, we needed seven. Yeah, seven runners, not six runners and Danny Diaz. Hey, Danny's our anchor. And he'll drag our ass down. All right, knock it off, Puentes. Let's see if those legs work as fast as your mouth. Elmo Bridge and back. Go. Go. Hey. I mean it, all right? You're my anchor, Danny, and not because you're fat. And you are a little fat, okay? So you better lose some weight. So, why am I the anchor? Because you're gonna hold this team steady, okay? I lose you, I'll lose your brothers. You're important, Diaz. Let's go. You hot, homes? You tired? Because anytime you wanna stop, we're cool with that. Now I've seen everything. You guys keep going. Down to the bridge and back. I'll time you from here. Hey, what are you doing? You can't quit. Oh, God. Thank... Thank you. Let's get some water. Where's Victor? Anybody seen Danny? There he is. Yeah, slower than 911 to a Mexican's house. Those the best running shoes you guys got? Best running shoes, school shoes, church shoes. - Good, Danny. - Good job. Good job, hermano. All right. Put them on. New shoes. New shorts, man! Ain't no way I'm wearing these. Yeah, well, then you're running naked, because those are our uniforms. Hey, we wear them, you wear them, ese. All right, let's hurry up. Don't forget to take the tags off, right. - Coach Jameson? - Yes, sir? Jim White, McFarland. I didn't know McFarland had a team. Is that them? Yeah. Yeah. They're faster than they look. If you say so. See you on the course. Okay, guys. Okay, here we go. Remember, scoring is based on your individual places, all right? You finish first, that's a 1. Second, that's a 2, and so on. The team with the lowest combined score for their top 5 runners wins. So the lowest score wins? That's right, it's like golf. You think we play golf? We don't got a country club. We don't even got a Kmart. I bet that guy plays golf. Hold on. If my score don't count, why am I even here? To make us look faster, panzón. All right, look. Just try and remember, lowest score wins. If you get ahead of any of their top five guys, that adds points to their total. Even you, Danny. Got it? Doesn't matter. Let's go show them how it's done. Come on, Danny! Where the hell is McFarland? I hear they can't run without a cop behind them. Or a Taco Bell in front of them. Timers ready? Runners, take your mark... Come on. 5: 17. Good pace, Hunter. 5:22, Thomas! Keep that pace! Come on! Come on! Get it. Get it. You got him! Come on! Stay with him! Stay with him! That's it! That's it! You're looking great! Good pace, Robby! Keep the pace. Keep that up! Come on. Pick it up. Go! Go! Go! Jose, good! Good, David, good! Come on, Danny! That's a boy, Hunter! Take him, take him! Come on, kid! Come on, Hunter. - Come on! - Come on. Power it up! Come on. Stay steady. Stay steady. You got him, Hunter! Come on! Move it, move it! You got him! Way to go! Atta boy! Atta boy! That's right, bring it home, baby! Bring it home. - Nice. - Come on, buddy. Come on, come on. Get up! Let's go. Blue jersey is right on to you. Keep that spot. Kick it! You can get him! You can get him! You can get him! - Keep it! - Hold that position! Yes! Good, Thomas. Good. Good job, guys! Good job! Centennial, Centennial, Palo Alto and Morro Bay. Finish strong! Palo Alto, McFarland. Morro Bay, McFarland. All the way. McFarland. McFarland. Good, Danny, you never stopped. You never stopped. And McFarland. Coming in with a combined score of 35, the winner is... Centennial. Second, Palo Alto, 41. - Nice! - Right here! Third, Morro Bay, 61. Good job. Yeah. And in fourth place with a score of 104... McFarland. That's a great race, boys. - Yeah. - Yeah, it's great guys. So I guess, better luck next time, boys? Right? Yeah? Seriously. Later. What happened out there today was not your fault, you hear me? It was my fault. I should have checked the course. That final hill, I should have known about that. Thomas would have eaten that kid's lunch. What happened out there today is on me, understood? Understood? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Good. Hello, son. Say hello to your father. But fourth place, in your first meet. That's not too shabby. Fourth out of four. Also known as last. Last doesn't get us out of here. Last doesn't get me a job somewhere else. I'm way too soft on these kids. Hey. It's Julie's birthday tomorrow, remember? Could you please stop by the store and pick up her cake on the way home? Sure. I got her a really fancy one. It's beautiful. Jim? Birthday dinner is at 6:00, okay? Okay. Okay, I hear you. Okay. We don't have a hill. These are our hills. This is where we're gonna run. All of them? That's right. What happened to us in Palo Alto, never gonna happen again. Let's go. Let's go! We're done. Who's done? We are. You mean you want to quit? Go home, stretch out on the couch? Guess what? Me, too. But it ain't gonna happen. Here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna catch our breath, and then we're gonna hit it again. Danny's about to collapse. It's hard. - It's hard? - Yeah. I'll tell you what's hard, is watching someone pass you on that last hill. Just ask Thomas. What's hard is losing when you know you haven't done enough. All right, we're going to get to the point where when we see a hill, we smile. The higher, the better. All right. Now we know what we didn't know, right? Right? Now we know what we didn't know. Today's the beginning. Let's hit it again. Let's hit it again. Come on, guys. What are you waiting for, Valles? Who's got one more? Come on, lean into this. Good. Good. Come on. Let your arms take you up that hill. Change the gear when you go uphill. You gotta change it. Change the gear going up that hill! Come on, Danny, start to give it to me! If we don't back down they won't, either. Come on, Diaz, they're lapping you. Pick it up, Danny. All right? You're the anchor. You're not the brake. Atta boy. Good, Jose. You think I'm picking on you, Diaz? Go faster, I'll pick on somebody else. Good! Good! That's it. Take a break. Okay, good. Good. Okay, that's what I wanted to see. That's how we need to finish. Good job. Take a break. Valles! Valles, I said take a break. How many more do you want? 10, 20, 100? Take a break! You think you're tough, White? Well, we're tougher, right. We're not runners. We're pickers. And we're always gonna be pickers. And every day we're gonna get up and do the same thing over and over again, just like this. So you can make us do it a hundred times, a thousand times, because guess what? It's never gonna change, all right? You know what these are, White? You know what's under here? Almond hulls. You eat almonds? You like them? They come out the packet real nice, right? Well, somebody picked those, White. But you can use them for hill training, right? Valles. Suspend me if you want, man. I'm done. Okay, practice is over. Are you going to leave again? This is your fault. Everything is always my fault. Be quiet. You've abandoned us. Be quiet! Where's the cake? Happy birthday, sweetheart. I'm sorry I was late. You forgot it, didn't you? That's okay. I didn't really want it anyway. This was really important to her, Jim. I'm sorry, all right? I'm sorry, but my... My best runner just quit. No, check that. I mean, I... I mean... He didn't just quit. He had some kind of breakdown. I don't care. Julie is 15 years old, and you couldn't even remember her cake. Well, if a missed cake's the worst thing that ever happens to her, she's got it over most of these kids. You know what? She's your daughter, Jim. And if you think any one of those fathers out there would miss their daughter's birthday, then you oughta go out and see what kind of cakes they get them. Julie? Julie, please let me in. Go away, Dad. Thomas? What are you doing on the bridge, Thomas? I don't know. Who hit you? No one. All right, my dad. But it wasn't his fault. I don't know about that. Yeah, well, you don't know about a lot of things. Okay, White? You haven't got a clue. All right, then... Then explain it to me. Help me figure it out. Look, he's a picker. He's not a foreman like Señor Diaz. He doesn't run a crew. He just tries to get whatever work he can find, Arizona, Texas, wherever. And he got back yesterday and his baby girl is pregnant. And so he just started hitting the wall, all right? And I was trying to get him to stop, and I just got in the way. Look, if he hurts his hands, he can't work. Do you get that? Okay. Okay, Thomas, I get it. Do you want to know why I'm out here, middle of night, driving around by myself? No. Too bad. I'm gonna tell you anyway. I forgot to buy my daughter's birthday cake. That's bad, White. Look, you... You scared me today. You did. And you're... You're scaring me now, so you wanna come off of there? No. Okay, then let me tell you the truth about what happens, how this ends, if you... If you fall from here. If you go off this bridge tonight, and there's every chance you might, you'll probably live, all right? It's not that high, but I promise you, Thomas, there's no chance you'll ever run again. None. And right now I'm guessing running's the best thing you've got. Feels as if it might be the only thing you've got. Come on down. Okay? So you wanna... You wanna keep going with this cross country thing? Me, too. Me, too. You shorten your stride, lean into the hill, and lower your head. This is the only place you'll ever do this in cross country. Julie? Nobody can hold a grudge like a teenage girl. How about her mom? I'm working on it. Don't even think about it. All right, I'm not the ice cream man. Six miles. Same pace, all right? Gotta lay down our base. Johnny. Johnny, why are your arms flying around everywhere? I don't know. Why you riding a Barbie bike? Because it's pretty? I bet you got the matching doll house, too, huh? Which one are you, White? Blanco Barbie? All right, joke less, run more. Everybody tuck your arms in. You're all starting to look like the mangy chicken I got hanging around my house. You're not smiling, are you, Valles? No. No, I didn't think so. Be warm and loose for the start of the race. That's right, fellas. Stay nice and relaxed. Nice work. Okay. Come on. Come on. Everybody all right? This is a dual meet, just us and them, all right? Clovis versus McFarland. They're good, they're ranked, and they think we're pushovers. You ready? Let's do it, Blanco. All right. Where are we from? - Uno, dos, tres... - McFarland! All D block... All D block inmates, 15 minutes. Can they even understand you? You probably just point, huh? "Go that way, amigo." Yeah, something like that. 15:40, Derek! Just cruise to win. 15:45, Thomas! Now, go get him. Go get him. Atta boy. Atta boy. Come on, Thomas. 16:30, Thomas. Good job. Atta boy, Johnny. Jose, good. Come on, Danny. - Come on, Sean. - Come on, Danny! That's what I have. Well, it was close, boys. Like I said... They're a great team. But you're better. Clovis scored 28. McFarland, 27. Hang on. You mean... That's right. Lowest score wins. You just won your first race. Good race, amigo. I told you we were gonna win. Car trouble, honey? Come on in, baby, we'll get you fixed up. Come on in. Where are the Diazes? Out. "Out"? What do you mean "out"? Out like off the team. What? - Says who? - Says their father who's also their foreman. My boyfriend's got a garage in the back. He'll take a look at that little car of yours. Thank you. There you go. Oh, my goodness, honey. What have you been doing with these hands? Moving houses, I guess, trying to make a garden. Just sit back, enjoy the view, and we will get you out of here in no time. That's my boyfriend. He's handsome, isn't he? I know. Hey, Damacio. Look, you wouldn't understand. Damacio... This was our teacher for running, Mr. White. He just stopped by real quick to say hi. You wanna eat? Hope you like enchiladas, White. Ready to try it? A little bit. How many is that? Seven? Eight? Saying no is rude. Yeah, so is puking on the table. Take home to the family. No, no, señora, please. - Gracias, but I couldn't. - No. Don't say to me no, okay? My husband always working, but every day he's sitting at the table with his family. He's talking and he's listening. How you gonna be family if you no eating together, huh? I want that back. Can I give you a hand with those tubs? Just saying... Can I help you out? No, gracias. David... I'd like you to ask your father something for me. Yeah. You know what? Just tell him... Just tell him it was an honor to be invited into his home. Dad, he said it was an honor to be invited into your home. Tell him I say thanks. I'm sorry, I thought you... I get by. Thank you for your hospitality. We don't ask for help around here. You want to help me wash my buckets? You want to be a helpful person, that's okay. But I know why you're here. You want my sons to run a race. Mr. White, your sport is like a TV. It's not essential. Each hour that my boys train with you is one hour they do not work with me. That's food off our table. I don't expect a man like you to understand. Blanco? What are you doing here? You know you're white, right? You sure about this? Yeah, don't white people mow their lawns on Saturday? I haven't got a lawn. What are we doing? You're not gonna like it. Blanco? Now you just gotta lean it over and cut. Take off the outer leaves and turn it over. This will be your row, okay? Keep your knees bent or it'll hurt your back. You okay, Blanco? You guys do this all day? Yeah. Get this field done, maybe start on another one. You get paid by the hour? Not by the hour, by the field. The faster we get this one done, the more our father makes. By the field? Hey, Damacio, how old were you guys when you started working for your dad? 10? 11? Is that even legal? Strawberries, it is. And potatoes. Other crops, you gotta be 12. I remember, first day I started, I wanted to quit after the first hour because it was so hard. Cried like a baby. Yeah, I know how you feel. You wanna quit, Blanco? What do you think? Blanco? I'm sorry, it's my back. I know, I know. Just lie down. Face down. Come on. Yeah. It's okay. It's okay. You just gotta do this every few hours when you first start. Your body's not used to it. Okay, listen, guys. I get it. Your father needs you. All right, so this is... Thank you. This is what we do.
