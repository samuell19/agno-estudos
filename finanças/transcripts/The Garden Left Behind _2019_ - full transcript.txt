[liquid pours] [clink] [static] [Car honking in the background] [Car honking in the background] [Music playing] [Music playing] I'm sorry, are you available? Yeah, get in! Yeah. Get in, guys. Hi Hi. So we're going to 76th and Queens Boulevard. - Okay. - Is that okay? - Yeah. Great. - Is that grandma's house? Yes. [Music playing] - You're good to go? - Yeah, I'm good. Okay. Head first. Okay. Watch your head. [Music playing] Sir, where are you going? [Music playing] [Drunk guy vomited in the background] [Music playing] [Door bell rings] I'm coming! Antonio! [Knocking on the door] Antonio, wake up! [Water gushing] [Phone ringing] What's up? You have an appointment tomorrow. Oh, don't remind me. Do you wanna do this or not? Of course I want to do this. It's just so much - I have to go to the doctor, to see the psychologist, to get the letter, to get the approval... Listen, I've seen girls do this black market style and you don't want any part of that, trust. I know, you're right. They just wanna get to know you, Tina. Now, listen, you got to be honest, all right? Yes, yes. I'm going to tell them everything, like who I am, where I came from, what I had for breakfast. Girl, just let them know it. If he doesn't approve you, Tina, you can't transition. I know. I know. Right. And I believe in you. I'll talk to you later. Love you. Love you. Bye. Good morning, Grandma. What's this? It came! Hold on... What is it? You're gonna love it. Close your eyes! - No peeking. No, no, no, no, no. Okay, Fine. Okay, open. Look! Antonio. Oh my God, you bought it! The one we saw on TV. Now, you don't have to bend down. It's the future. Oh, Grandma. I'm going to the market. - Ah! - Do you need anything? No, no, no. - I'm good. - Should I leave it with you? Yeah, I'm going to try it out. Oh, Grandma. All right, go on. God bless you. [Mexican music playing in the background] Hi. Thanks. Have a good one. [Overlapping] [Vacuum cleaner buzzing] [Mexican music playing in the background] Grandma, I'm back. [Door closes] What's wrong? I broke it. I'm an idiot. I broke it already! Let me see, let me see. Calm down. These instructions are all in English! Oh, Grandma. What? You didn't break it. - I didn't? - This is so funny, look. Really? Oh, Antonio. You're such a handyman. You can do more than you think. All right, all right, all right... But, how about this vacuum, huh? It's wonderful. And, it works! Look how it dances. You got all your moves from your grandmother. [Music playing in Foreign Language] Where are you from? I'm from Mexico, but I have been here since I was five years old. How long have you been driving? Almost eight years. Quite a lot... Yeah. And you? Where are you from? I'm from El Salvador. Which part? From San Salvador. [Music playing in Foreign Language] [Birds chirping] Do you have any concerns relating to your family? No, not really. No? The boys at school made fun of me when I didn't want to play football. When I'd get home I would run to my room and hide under the covers. Grandma would come in, sit next to me on the bed and she'd say that I made her very proud. She's the only family I have. We're very close. Let's just say she always has my back. Wow. Now, do you remember anything about Mexico? Ah, not... I mean, maybe a little. Maybe I just remember what grandma tells me. She talks about it all the time. The food. Her home. The garden. Why are you here? All right, there's certainly no need that you have to tell me now but eventually I'd like to hear the answer to that. [Birds chirping] Hey, are you gonna help me? Hello? Are you napping on me? I can't do it. And I can't do this all by myself. Every week it's the same shit. Why are you here, Tina? Are you happy? Do you accept the full consequences of the side effects? I'm on your team. Everyone's life is complicated. I know, girl. No shit my life's complicated. Whose isn't? I just don't know why I have to convince some old ass man of who I am. Do you want this done the right way? Yeah. Then listen to your fucking doctor. I listen to old people all day, every day. Do you know how many girls I know that went to him? He's like the first doctor that started working with us in New York City. Trust me. You're in good hands. How many more questions am I gonna have to answer? Probably forty billion. Ugh, stop. Probably never met anyone quite like you. You're doing it wrong. It just rained like four hours ago. Why are you watering it? And what do you know about gardening? I know two things that my grandma taught me back in Mexico. How to garden and how to cook. Hmm. And I still don't know how to cook. We're not gonna fucking get anything. [Overlapping] [Chime clanging] Yo Chrisy! Are you constipated? Let it out, bro. [Plastic rustling] What'd we got here? Oh, cream pies! Hey, c'mon guys, you have to pay for those. Yo, we'll catch you later, bro. Relax, okay? Geez. Ahh, yo, let me get a pack of Cowboy Killers. It's 12 bucks. Come on, just to hump a little faggot, man. Just give it to me. I'll pay you back later, man. Come on. Come on, due today, we gotta go. Thank you. Yo, Saturday, 6'oclock, all right? No excuses, all right? You gonna fucking be there? - Yeah. - You're gonna fucking be there? All right. Yeah. [Overlapping] Come on, no fucking excuses, all right? And don't be fucking late, all right? Thanks for the chocolate, boss. Peace out, Chrisy. See you later, pussy. [Chime clanging] [Music playing] [Overlapping] [Crowd clapping] [Music playing in the background] This place is amazing. Right? Told you. It's about time you took me out. What do you mean? I mean this is a big step for you. I still don't know what you mean. What? We're both busy people. We're out now, aren't we? We are, and it's wonderful. Our delivery guy is gonna think we died or something. Hey, you look stunning. Yeah? You're not too bad yourself. [Music playing] Yeah? Beautiful night. That food was so good. You like that? It's one for the books, man. Yeah, that's bucket list shit, bro. Did you see that fucking tranny, bro? No, fucking way. Curb that bitch, man! [Door closes] [Door closes] It'll get better. Shh. Look at me. You're beautiful. Shit. Those titties are hot as hell. Holy shit... Oh my God, he's like pounding her, holy shit. Watch the cum shot... 1 -2... oohh That's a lot of jizz, bro. Like superhero status... Guy's fucking loaded, man. Yo, get your hand off your dick. C'mon, you guys act like you don't do it too. Yeah, at home. Not in front of my friends, ya fucking faggot... Little freak. [Birds chirping] Where were you last night? Looking for a job? Yes. You're lying. He could have slept on the sofa. He didn't need to sleep on the sofa. You're not a good friend, Antonio. I think he had a good time. All right, fine. I won't get in your business. Good idea. Don't speak to me like that. Listen. I take care of the money and you take care of the house. Maybe your friend could help you get a job. He can't. Why not? That's what friends are for. Penn Station, please. Yeah, hoping to catch the train. Shouldn't be too bad. [Birds chirping] [Music playing] Do you feel that there is a fit between how you feel about your gender and how others perceive you? Are there issues in your life that might complicate the transition process? No. How do you feel about the permanent effect of these hormones? I don't know... Carol keeps asking me to get a matching tattoo with her, but I "chicken out every time. I’m afraid I’ll get bored of it or something." And? And this is nothing like a tattoo. It's much more serious. Yeah. It's not a choice. I'm trying to get you to understand what you're getting into. Ugh. Now, we're working together you and I. We're on the same team. But I need to know more so that I can evaluate you. [Music playing in the background] Hmm. That's exactly what I needed. Thank you, Demos. Thank you, Demos. Enjoy, ladies. What is wrong? I don't even know why I'm doing this. Hey, don't give up. What's your name? Don't ignore me. What is your name? Tina. Damn right you are. Demos, who is this? Tina Damn right that is. Demos, Tina. Tina, Demos. You guys don't get it. How do I not get it? Well, about time you decided to show up. Where's Demos? Somebody order me a drink. Are you okay? Just came from the hospital. What is wrong? I'm fine. It's not me. Do you remember Rosie from my Poetry Club? Yeah. Well, she was beat by two cops last night. Oh. Oh, my God. These fucking cops! These are the people who are supposed to be protecting us, not attacking us. But why? Because she's like us, that's why... We have to mobilize. All of us. Band together and fight this. Well, I'm not sure I'll be of any help... I'm not really a motivator. Oh, girl, you're killing me. Read this. This is who was silenced last night... Are you with us? I'd like to thank my wonderfully supportive boss, Mr. Ning, for allowing us to use his business for our headquarters. Thank you, Mr. Ning! [Overlapping] [Cheers and applause] It is with great pleasure that I introduce, esteemed advocate, hailing from the great city of San Francisco, my girl, Lilly Villahermosa! [Cheers and Applause] [Overlapping] Thank you all so much. Why are we all here tonight? For Rosie! Rosie! We're angry! [Overlapping] Yes. We're angry, but we're not defeated. No. We want justice. We want justice for Rosie and the thousands of others whose names history has forgotten. We accepted being outcasts but we forgot something so vital. That we have a voice. We don't need anyone to speak for us. We can speak for ourselves and we will. [Overlapping] Our sister Rosie was dragged to the ground by someone who was supposed to protect us. We ask why. But we know why. From the moment Rosie spoke her truth, she had a target on her back. That's right. [Overlapping] Yes, it is. The same one that I wear. The one that we all share. And I don't know about any of you but I am sick and tired of living like this. [Overlapping] We have the right to exist! We might be the children of a lesser God, but it is a God nonetheless. [Overlapping] That's right. We have to stand up and fight for ourselves! We'll make them pay! [Overlapping] No, we show respect. We show respect when we're given respect. We're gonna make everyone hate us even more? Then they win. [Overlapping] Enough! We all have our differences in this room. But it is time to retake our seats at the table of society. It is time that we take to the streets and demand our rights! And let history record with a certainty that some of us may fall that on this night, this gypsy band of wonderful, vibrant, and creative people decided to say in one voice... "No more!" No more! Tonight, we unite, from this day forward, we are one. Because I am Rosie, you are Rosie, we are all Rosie. Rosie! [Overlapping] Rosie! Rosie! Rosie! Rosie! Rosie! Rosie! Rosie! [Music playing] Oh, my Gosh. I saw the picture, they were great. I look awful. No. Come on, you look gorgeous. What? I don't know. I've never... I never thought I'd be involved in activism or something, but... it just feels right, you know? Well, I'm proud of you. You should be proud of yourself. Yeah. Cheers. To the happy couple. So get this, Kevy. We're walking in the park one day, over by Bethesda... Again with this story. Why do you... Let me finish. Let me finish... And all of a sudden, his Uncle Frank comes jogging right past us. We keep walking but he comes right back around to meet us. But funny enough, Jason didn't even bother introducing us. We... What can I say, Jay? We spoke for two seconds. He was jogging. Yeah, and what's your excuse for your parents? Are they jogging too? Can we just enjoy the night? You're missing the point here. Are you happy? What? Are you happy being with me? Yes. Now stop questioning me all the time. What's wrong with the two of you? Kevin, do I look happy to you? Well, you usually are when you're sitting next to a beautiful woman. See, what did I tell you? You're both full of shit. It's last round, okay? Last call. What the hell? It's not even midnight. No, it isn't, buddy, but Stephanie quit on me. So, what am I gonna do? - Do you need someone? - Yeah. I'm looking for a job. You bartending? Shut up. I can do it. You know how to make a Manhattan? Pssh. That's easy. Come on in, let me see. Okay. That was a good move. I'm happy to show you. Here's the big test. Oh. Now this. Boom. Try that. That's pretty good. Yeah? Yeah, you're hired. Ha! Honestly. No, it is. It's good. Seriously? You're gonna trust her after one drink? Yeah. That's... You're hired. I'll give you the job. Ha. Come here. I know more than one drink, babe. [Cheers and applause] Thatta boy! C'mon, you got it. Come on. [Overlapping] Come on, man. Let's do it. Right out of the fucking park, baby. [Overlapping] Yeah! [Overlapping] Let's do it. Control, Chris, all right? Control. Don't you hit none of that dumb shit, all right, baby? Wait, Chris, Chris. Come here, come here. This bitch likes to pitch high, all right. - So don't be fooled, all right? - Yeah. [Overlapping] C'mon, Chris, bring me home! Hit that shit to right field, baby. That kid sucks dick. [Overlapping] You got this, Chris. I believe in you. Let's do it, Chris. I believe in you. Come on. [Overlapping] Come on. Keep your eye on the fucking ball. What the fuck you waiting for? Hey, move in. We got a rookie. Shake it off. [Overlapping] [Cheers and applause] Come on! What the fuck was that!? This motherfucking pussy is gonna make us lose the game. [Overlapping] Okay. So, why you fucking... Why you fucking... Dude, just let play. I told you. Let him play the fucking game, shut up. Hey, man, c'mon let's go. We gotta finish this game. I gotta get home and fuck your mother tonight. [Overlapping] Bitch. Hey, go fuck off, bitch. Come on, Chris. [Overlapping] [Cheers and applause] [Music playing] Wait up a sec. Hey, Chris. Good job tonight, man. Thanks, man. Wow. Look at that shiner, dude. Ooh. I know. - It's good. It's fine. - Damn. That is like... woo. It's okay. That'll leave a bruise, man. It'll be all right. It's a good one... Good job, you earned it. Thanks. See you later, all right. Take care of that fucking eye, all right. See you. Yeah. See you, Manny. Put steak on that, bro. Yeah. [Overlapping] Is this a new show? I don't know. Will you be getting home early tonight? I'll do my best, but... I have an appointment with the doctor today. Just stay home where you belong. We never spend time together anymore. That's not true, Grandma. You always miss the Wheel of Fortune. Maybe if you watched something more exciting, I'd come home earlier. [Music playing in foreign language] Hello? [Music playing in the background] Nice hologram. Looks legit. Over the time you were here, were you horribly frightened, terribly threatened, about living illegally in the United States? Are you happy? Define happiness. I can't define happiness except for myself. Okay. What is happiness for you? Happiness for me is waking up next to my wife, seeing the success of my children, grandchildren. Loving my work. That's beautiful. Thank you. I'm serious. Okay. I gotta go... Hey. Can I come in? - This is awesome. - Yeah? Yeah, you're saving my ass. You have no idea. Thanks. I'm so grateful for this. All right, well, uh, I'll get your paperwork filed and I'll send in to payroll and like, by next week you'll be all set. Okay. Here's my green card. Oh, great. Is Jason gonna come down and see you in action? I hope so. I mean, I texted him, so... All right. Well, let's get started. Come on. All right. After you. [Talking in the background indistinctively] [Laughing] Excuse me. That's you. Yeah? Can I get a vodka martini? Okay. [Talking in the background indistinctively] Thanks. [Talking in the background indistinctively] [Overlapping] Whiskey. I don't have change, is that my tip? Absolutely. In a cup. You sure? I can give you a cup. Sure. [Overlapping] On the rocks? [Overlapping] [Music playing] I have to get up early for work tomorrow. Okay. I'll walk you out. [Vacuum cleaner buzzing] [Phone ringing] Hello? Tina. Oh, hi, Dr. Cleary. This is Dr. Cleary. Just a second. Can you hear me now? Now, based on my evaluations, I am able to confirm that you have gender dysphoria. You may seek treatment. [Music playing] [Music playing] As NYPD Officers Bowman and Killeen head to court to face charges in the brutal beating of 27-year-old transgender woman Rosemarie Jimenez, many local grassroots organizations are coming out in support of her. We will not rest until we see justice for Rosie. Until all trans people are allowed to walk down the street comfortably. We are too often victims of violence and abuse, we experience discrimination on a daily basis. The homicide rate in the transgender community is the highest it's been in its second year. These are evils that threaten our lives and we want to protect it. It ends here. Now. Thank you so much. This is Tricia Berman for Channel 14 News. [Talking in the background indistinctively] Hmm. Is it gonna hurt? It won't. No worries. Oh, God. Hey, Tina. You doing all right? Yeah, I'm okay. I hate blood. I know, you look so nervous. Don't worry, you'll be fine. Yeah, I hope so. Just breathe. It's almost over. Okay. All right, I'll see you real soon. Okay. Thank you. We will start with a testosterone blocker before moving on to estrogen. Okay. Now, let's discuss the changes that you should expect. All right. Breast growth, enlargement of nipples, redistribution of body fat, and thinning of the skin. We will then prescribe a similar dose of anti-androgens to prevent the formation of testosterone in your body. And pro-estrogens for thyroid and bone health. Do you have any questions at this point? Uh, how big will my breasts get? Well, I can't absolutely predict that. And it will take at least a month or two before you start seeing any difference so you have to patient with the process. Okay. Okay? And I just need you to know that this will require multiple visits because I will need to keep an eye on your liver and kidney functions and would like you to be regularly seen by specialists given the risks factors involved. I understand. The biller will be in touch but Dr. Brown just wanted you to be aware of what you can expect. Okay... That's a lot of money. There are many steps involved. And without insurance, we'll need to require full payment in cash upfront on your next visit. Okay. Have a nice day. Thanks. You too. Hi. Hello. And, can I get a scratch off please? [Plastic rustling] Ah, which one? Hmm. The one that'll give me the most money. Ah, Win for Life. You're thinking big, aren't you? I'll tell you what, if I do win, I'll split it with you two ways. Deal? Okay. Do you believe me? Uh, 12 dollars. Okay. All right. Thanks. Thanks. Have a good one. [Door closes] [Chime clanging] [Car engine revving] Yo. Are you selling the car? What? Are you selling the car? Oh, uh... yeah. You wanna take a look at it? Yeah. It's kind of dirty, but I can clean that up. She got a lot of miles on it. Yeah. I drive around all day, so... What you asking? Twenty-one hundred. I can give you eight hundred cash. Eight hundred? Eight hundred. No way, it's taxi registered. This is gold. Eight hundred cash right now. No. I'm okay. I guarantee you're not gonna get a better deal than that. No. I'll try. All right, you got a pen? Check by the glove box. Eight hundred? That's nothing. When you figure out that's what she's worth, just give me a call, all right? Oh, Grandma Why are you selling the car? I'm gonna bartend for Kevin. I don't need the taxi anymore. And that'll support us? Yeah, it'll support us. How can you work without papers? That's never been a problem. It's very simple. The solution to all our problems is to... "Go back to Mexico." Exactly! Now you get it. [Phone ringing] Hello? Hello? Chris. Coming. - We got customers. - Yeah, yeah. I'm coming. Come on. Your field has really expanded over the last decade. Tell me how so. Well, very interestingly I've been very fortune to be working with the transgender community to support them in their vocal transition. Can you talk to us a little bit about what this process looks like? This is how we do it, we start small - allowing our clients to become aware of their overall vocal qualities and their discomfort and then we work on relieving tension through breathing exercises and work on strengthening and balancing through a series of vocal exercises. Working with these clients has given me some of the most rewarding moments of my career. [Music playing] The purpose of this exercise is to relax your mind, and to guide you to create your own peaceful, safe place. Easier said than done. Shh. Just concentrate. Continue to breathe slowly. Gently. Comfortably. Take a deep breath. In and out. When you're ready to return to your day, file away this imaginary place in your mind, waiting for you the next time you need it. I'm gonna need it. That's what it's there for. But keep with you that feeling of calm as you return to your everyday life. Okay. That was nice. Yeah. Good. We're making progress. Now that you're relaxed, let's try some exercises. Okay. So that I can evaluate the quality of your voice. Hmm. I can be pretty loud. Oh, you want that corrected too? No way. Good. It's good to have a loud voice. It's good to be heard. Exactly. All righty. Let's start a few exercises. How about raspberries? - Really? - Really. It stretches the muscles. Okay. Okay. [Raspberry sound] I know it's silly. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay. [Raspberry sound] No, no. [Raspberry sound] [Raspberry sound] That's it. How about a couple tongue trills. Oh, okay. I know a good one. Grandma taught me. Perfect. What do you even need me for? Trust me, doc. I need you. I need this. Fair enough. The important thing is that we train you not to strain your voice. Okay. Let's keep going. Okay. - Raspberry. - Again? [Laughter] [Raspberry sound] Okay. Okay. I got my practice in for the day. Girl, you sound good. Keep it up. Thank you, Demos. Girl, why are you always on your phone? He hasn't returned any of my calls all week. Oh, shit. Call him now. No. I've texted him plenty of times already. Ugh. But that's why you call him, honey. He has to hear your voice.... Oh honey. Honey. You don't let a man get you upset like that. It ain't worth it. He loves me. Do you need some help? Of course, sweetheart. Better late than never. You're finally getting good at this. Better late than never. What did I tell you? Do as I say, not as I do. So, I shouldn't cook like you? No, that you should do. My food is delicious. Ask anybody in the neighborhood. You're right. You know where we could get the best food in the world? Where? Grandma, please. In Mexico! Yeah, yeah, yeah... We'll spend the rest of our days in Mexico. Sitting in the garden, drinking sangria. We could live a very tranquil life... Simple, without complications. And you wouldn't get in trouble. Grandma, please. Stop it! Antonio. What? Will you give me a hug? But if you burn this food, I'll kill you. Jason, can I talk to you? Sorry, busy. Jason. What the fuck are you doing here? This is my job. We talked about this. Really? You haven't talked to me in days. You can't just barge up to me at my fucking job whenever you feel like. I don't know what you think this is but it isn't a relationship. So, what? Two years like that? I can't believe you. It's fine, okay? Get yourself some therapy, get whatever body parts you want and leave me the fuck out of your mess. What a fucking asshole? - Fuck you! - Whatever! Don't come back to my job again! It's over! Fuck him! Seriously, fuck him! I always knew there was something about him that was off. I mean, you're out here taking on the big city, organizing huge rallies and he runs off? That's exactly where I went wrong. Maybe I should have never been doing... Hey. You did nothing wrong. You're better off without his sorry ass. He had a weird face anyway. Like, his nose, it looked all funny and weird... Hey! Mr. Right will come along. Mr. Right is out there for you. Yeah? But what about him? Why can't he see me? I see you and you're beautiful. [Cars engine revving] It smells so good! It's a special request. From who? Go to the patio. Surprise! Wow, you guys! You're big 3-0! You really shouldn't have! Wow! You guys are just looking for an excuse to party. [Overlapping] Duh, story of my life! My birthday isn't until two weeks. Have a seat. Sit down. Can I have rice, please? [Overlapping] Which I've been doing out here with the fork. Setting out? What did you guys get me? Some rice? Oh, my god, so I have to make a toast. Is this gonna be long? - C'mon, guys. C'mon. Put this on. - Really? - Yes. Put it on right now. It's your day. You're the princess. How does it look? I know you were a little nervous when I invited you to my crazy little group, but you've just... you've thrived. I'm gonna cry. Girl, you cry at everything. Let me do the toast, okay? Ah, excuse me. To... I've known her way longer. I get to go first. Okay, fine. To our Tina for overcoming so much, for showing the world who we are, people to be proud of. Happy 30th birthday! Grandma, what's wrong? You're forgetting to say grace. We don't have to do that right now. There are a lot of things to be thankful for. Okay, we'll do it. She says we have to do grace. Who's Grace? No, silly. We have to pray. For what? So we can eat! Okay, cool. Thank you Lord, for all these gifts, and this food that you have given us. In Christ, our Lord. Amen. Amen. That was nice. [Overlapping] Do you have a knife? Yes, of course. You speak Spanish! Yeah, a little bit. Thank you, sweetheart. Be careful. Can I ask you a question? Yes, Mami. Let's sit down for a second. Tell me. Have you been through this too? Been through what? If you've... changed... Oh, yeah, yeah! It's just... Antonio doesn't tell me anything. I don't know why he wants to do it. That's not the question you should be asking. What do you mean? Do you love Tina? With all my heart. Well, instead of asking 'Why'... Why don't you ask if she's happy? Well, I gotta get back. The girls need to eat. Yes, yes. Of course! [Overlapping] Yes! [Overlapping] Blow it. Let there be light. Oh, my gosh. There we go. Oh, my gosh. Thank you. Make a wish. Let me think of it. Let me think. Let's protect the flame. We'll protect it. That's cute. I like that. [Applause] [Overlapping] Hey, this is Tina. I'm not available right now. Please leave your name and number, I'll... Oh, shit. I swear to fuckin' god. Whoa. Oh. Is that Chrisy? Look at that. What the fuck? Oh, my god. Oh, shit. He got a clean cut! What the fuck? We've got a fucking skinhead! Rub his hair for good luck... You feel like a new man, right? Let's go. You ready for the game? Right You better be ready, bro. Okay. All good. [Music playing] Sign this for you... Okay. You'll take good care of her? Absolutely. All right. She's in good hands. I hope so. Hi. I'm here for- Ah, thank you. We'll call you back. Hi, I'm here for Dr. Brown. I have the money. What's the matter? Have a seat, Tina. How are you feeling? Fine. Good. So, what's up, doc? We received the results from your tests and it appears that you have a disorder known as Wilson's Disease. Okay. What does that mean? It means that you are possibly predisposed to liver disease. The good news is that for you it is not life threatening. And it can be treated with medication and it must be treated with medication, okay? And unfortunately there are high levels of copper in your liver and your body just will not be able to support the hormone dosage that is needed for transition. I'm sorry, Tina. There's gotta be a mistake. Maybe you can do something else. That- No, no, no, no. You can do it over. But... You have to... There must be wrong. No. Sweetheart, we have to look out for your overall health. [Sobbing] No! Tina, listen to me. It's very good we caught this in time. I'm so sorry- I never get to... You have your life. [Music playing] I'll never... [Music playing] [Overlapping] Hey, hey. Ho, ho. Trans haters have got to go. Hey, hey. Ho, ho. [Overlapping] We're here at a demonstration for Rosemarie Jimenez. We're just moments away from hearing whether the jury will choose to indict NYPD officers Bowman and Killeen. The crowd behind me is patiently awaiting the hearing... Trans haters have got to go. Hey, hey. Ho, ho. Trans haters have got to go. Hey, hey. Ho, ho. [Music playing] Tina, where are you, girl? I've been calling you all day. Call me back. Are you guys ready? Yeah! Justice! Justice! Justice! Justice! Justice! Justice! What do we want? Justice! When do we want it? Now! Justice for Rosie! Justice for Rosie! [Laughter] Fucking good. Oh, yes, bro. You're fucking good. Here, man.
