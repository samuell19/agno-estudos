( instrumental music playing ) ( shouting ) ( horses whinnying ) ( man shouting ) Man's voice: WHEN LAURA AND I FIRST MET, WE HAD JUST ONE DREAM BETWEEN US-- TO OWN AND OPERATE OUR OWN RANCH. BUT, HEY, EVERYBODY KNOWS RANCHING ISN'T THE EASIEST BUSINESS THESE DAYS. WE WERE BARELY KEEPING OUR HEADS ABOVE WATER. - DID YOU COUNT? - YEAH, I GOT ABOUT 21. THAT'S WHAT I GOT. LET'S ROUND UP THEM OTHER BROOD MARES TOMORROW. LAURA! LAURA! MONTE'S ON THE PHONE. HE'S BEEN RELEASED BY THE COMMUNISTS. HE'S COMING HOME! GOD HELP US. THE COMMIES DIDN'T EVEN WANT HIM. HE'S BRINGING WITH HIM THE GRAND "CHAMPEEN" PERFORMANCE STALLION OF ARIZONA. ( spits ) Man: OH, YEAH, YOUR GIRLIE MAGAZINES ARE STILL UNDER THE BED, BRO. I'LL BELIEVE IT WHEN I SEE IT, BUCK. ( laughs ) - HOW DID HE SAY HE GOT OUT OF NICARAGUA? - HANG ON. HE SAYS HE SHOT HIS WAY OUT. SHE'S VERY GLAD TO SEE YOU. OKAY, I'LL SEE YOU SOON. WHAT'S THIS ABOUT A CHAMPION STUD? ALL RIGHT, NOW, MONTE IS BRINGING IT. HE WANTS TO EXCHANGE IT FOR RENT ON THE CABIN BECAUSE HE WANTS TO SETTLE DOWN. HE SAYS HE WANTS TO SETTLE DOWN. HE'S MY BROTHER, LAURA. I GOTTA BELIEVE HIM. YOU DO? I DON'T. HIS POLICE RECORD IS WAY TOO LONG FOR ME TO TAKE MONTE AT HIS WORD. CHAMPION STUD. BE A MIRACLE IF HE DIDN'T STEAL IT, BUCK. YOU MAY BE RIGHT, BUT I CAN'T JUDGE. BUT WHAT I DO WANNA DO, AND I WANNA DO IT RIGHT THIS VERY, VERY MINUTE, IS I WANNA GATHER UP THOSE MARES BECAUSE THERE'S STILL TIME TO GET 'EM INTO FOAL YET, JUST IN CASE MONTE IS TELLING THE TRUTH ABOUT THAT STALLION. Buck's voice: AS FAR AS I CAN PIECE IT TOGETHER, IT ALL STARTED WITH A HORSE SOMEWHERE SOUTH OF THE BORDER-- MEXICO OR GUATEMALA. I DON'T KNOW. NOBODY EVER KNEW WHERE MONTE WAS COMING FROM. AS OUR DAD ALWAYS USED TO SAY, "DO WHATEVER YOU WANT, BUCK, BUT DON'T TRUST MONTE. THAT BOY WAS BORN CROOKED." ANYWAY, THIS STORY STARTS WITH INFIDEL. INFIDEL IS THE HORSE. EVERYBODY WANTED THAT STALLION. I WANTED HIM, MONTE'S TWISTED SIDEKICK KENNY WANTED HIM, AND MONTE'S LADY FRIEND MAUREEN WANTED HIM. SHE WANTED THAT HORSE, AND SHE WANTED MONTE, TOO. BUT I COULD HAVE TOLD HER MONTE WAS JUST NOT THE MARRYING KIND. THE MEDICATION'S BEGINNING TO SWEEP HIM UNDER. A GENTLE NARCOSIS. SLEEP. SLEEP, OLD FELLOW. LOOK, I DON'T WANT THE DAMN THING FALLING ON ME, DOC. YEAH, TRY AND MAKE THIS PERFECT, DOC. I MEAN, WE ALL GOT A TON RIDING ON THIS, YOU KNOW? - YOU INCLUDED. - ME INCLUDED? IF IT WASN'T ME INCLUDED, I WOULDN'T BE TAKING THESE RISKS, WOULD I? ( clears throat ) IT'S SO NICE TO HAVE YOU ABOARD, DOCTOR. I WONDER IF IT ISN'T TIME FOR YOU TO WORK YOUR MAGIC. WITH PLEASURE. MONTE, HONEY, THE MINUTE YOU GET TO THE STATION, PHONE ME, ALL RIGHT? - YEAH. - I'M GONNA BE GOING TO THE AIRPORT NOW. OH, SWEETHEART, I'M SO EXCITED. AFTER THIS, WE'LL BE TOGETHER FOREVER. GOD, I'M STARVED. WELL, GOOD LUCK TO YOU ALL. GOODBYE, MY DEAREST MONTE. HEY. OH, DON'T WORRY. THIS IS A VERY EASY PROCEDURE. AND IT'S FAIRLY SIMPLE ON THE HORSE. WHAT THE HORSE WON'T KNOW CAN'T HURT HIM, RIGHT? ( laughing ) HEY, DOC, HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO GET THESE EMERALDS OUT? Doctor: JUST TAKE OLD INFIDEL HERE OUT TO SOME QUIET SPOT AND SHOOT HIM. THE REST YOU DO WITH A SIMPLE JACKKNIFE. HE'S AN AWFUL GOOD HORSE, DOC. COMPARED TO WHAT? COMPARED TO ALL THESE EMERALDS? YOU KILL THIS HORSE AND DON'T LOOK BACK. ( emeralds rattle ) NOW, WHEN I TUCKED THE LOOT IN THERE, I PUT IT IN A PLACE THE HORSE HIMSELF WILL NEVER FEEL. AFTER YOU SHOOT HIM, JUST STAB AROUND IN THERE TILL YOU FEEL THE CONTAINER. YEAH, ONLY DON'T GO ON ABOUT KILLING THE HORSE SO MUCH, HUH, DOC? I MEAN, WE THINK THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL ANIMAL HERE. ( laughs ) WHATEVER. WHATEVER. BUT NOW I'D LIKE TO GET PAID. WELL, I GUESS I'LL BE SEEING YOU A LOT. SAY, DOC, IS IT SOUNDPROOF IN HERE OR WHAT? YEAH, NOBODY CAN HEAR A THING. OH, CAN'T HEAR A THING, HUH? YOU KNOW, FUNNY, BECAUSE AS YOU GET OLDER, - YOU REALLY APPRECIATE QUIET MORE, YOU KNOW? - YEAH. OH, MISTER, I WOULDN'T BREATHE A WORD. WOULDN'T BREATHE A WORD. YOU CRACK ME UP. DO "THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE" FOR ME, WILL YOU? WHAT? - DO "THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE"! ( gunshot ) - ( horse whinnying ) GET THE HORSE! STOP THAT HORSE! MONTE, MONTE! THIS IS SO UNPROFESSIONAL. HEY! GET THAT HORSE! GET THE HORSE! GET THAT HORSE! - WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA! DOWN! DOWN! WHOA. OKAY, IT'S OKAY. I DON'T BELIEVE YOU KILLED HIM, KENNY. I MEAN, I'VE NEVER BEEN INVOLVED IN A KILLING. KENNY, WILL YOU COME ON? HOW COME HE'S LAYING DOWN? RELAX, KENNY. HE'LL BE FINE. ( bell dings ) - STEWARDESS! - CAN I HAVE THE FIRST AID KIT, PLEASE? - ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? OH, I JUST HAVE SOME MINOR SURGERY HERE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. Woman over P.A.: Ladies and gentlemen, we'll be starting our descent into Tucson. Please fasten your seatbelts and bring your seats to their upright position. Thank you. THAT'S MONTE. THAT'S ME. THAT'S ME AND MONTE. CAT GOT YOUR TONGUE? I BEG YOUR PARDON? HOW LONG YOU BEEN DOWN IN MEXICO? OH. I WORK DOWN THERE. I SELL MINING EQUIPMENT. MY FAMILY'S IN TUCSON. I'M IN THE HORSE BUSINESS MYSELF. IMPORTS, TOO. SO WHAT DO YOU DO? YOU JUST KIND OF RENT A CAR IN TUCSON, DRIVE IT ON IN? NO, I LEFT MY CAR AT THE AIRPORT, ACTUALLY. OH, YOUR VERY OWN CAR? YEAH, MM-HMM. HOW TIGHT IS YOUR SCHEDULE? IS IT SEMI-TIGHT, OR JUST "I'LL SEE YOU WHEN I SEE YOU"? LIKE I SAY, I'M SELF-EMPLOYED. - WELL, YOU DIDN'T SAY THAT, ACTUALLY. - DIDN'T I? LOOK, WHAT'S ALL THIS ABOUT ANYWAY? WHY DO YOU ASK? I'LL SPRING IT ON YOU AT THE BAGGAGE CLAIM. Kenny: ONCE WE HOOK UP WITH MAUREEN IN TUCSON, WE'RE HOME FREE. YOU'RE HOME FREE. FACE IT, YOU COULD BE DOING WORSE. ( horse whinnies ) ( both speaking Spanish ) PRONTO, AMIGO. Attendant: BUDDY. Monte: MAUREEN'S GOTTA FIND US A MOTORHOME. SHE'S PROBABLY GOT HER HANDS FULL WITH THAT RIGHT NOW. WELL, SHE'S PROBABLY IN THE RACK WITH SOME STRANGER SHE MET ON THE PLANE. NOW, DON'T TALK THAT WAY. I MEAN, SHE IS MY GIRL, YOU KNOW? KENNY CALLS 'EM AS HE SEES 'EM, MONTE. WELL, DO ME A FAVOR AND STOP REFERRING TO YOURSELF AS KENNY. I THINK YOU'RE SUCCUMBING TO PARANOIA. I'M NOT PARANOID. IT'S A DISEASE UNKNOWN TO STAND-UP GUYS LIKE ME. HOW COULD I DO WHAT I'M DOING AND BE PARANOID? OH, YOU'D FIND A WAY. LISTEN, YOU WATCH ME AS WE GO THROUGH CUSTOMS WITH THE HORSE. WE'LL HAVE A LITTLE GUT CHECK AT U.S. CUSTOMS. BOLD IS BEST, PAL. - ( tires screeching ) - ( horns honking ) NOW I SEE WHY YOU DIDN'T WANT ME TO TAKE MY CAR. IF WE EVER GET OUT OF THIS ALIVE, IF GOD SO WILLS IT, JUST DROP ME AT AISLE 57, LONG-TERM PARKING. STOP FEELING SORRY FOR YOURSELF. WELL, I THINK I'M GONNA DROP YOU RIGHT HERE. THANKS. GOOD LUCK! REMEMBER, YOU PAY FOR EVERY PIECE OF ASS YOU GET. Kenny: NOW, I WANT YOU TO STUDY MY STRENGTHS OF CHARACTER, MONTE. WHEN I LEAD THAT HALF-TON OF HORSE THROUGH CUSTOMS, I WANT YOU TO CHECK OUT MY MONA LISA SMILE. AND I WANT YOU TO ASK YOURSELF, "WHAT KIND OF MAN IS KENNY? A MAN OR A MOUSE?" HAPPY TO DO IT, CREEP. DON'T BLOW IT. DON'T WORRY, I WON'T. IF YOU DON'T MIND NOW, I'M GONNA DO A LITTLE EXERCISE. EXERCISE? I GOT A HUNDRED NOTIONS I PICKED UP FROM THE ARMY'S RAPID DEPLOYMENT FORCES. LITTLE THINGS TO CURE YOU-- YOU KNOW, JETLAG, THAT TYPE OF THING. ONE OF MY FAVORITES IS ISOMETRICS FOR CONFINED AREAS. ( grunting ) ( Kenny grunting ) ( grunting continues ) - ( horse whinnying ) UNO! DOS! TRES! CUATRO! TURN IT UP, BABY! TURN IT UP, BABY! I'M A MAN! I'M A MAN! ( music playing ) ALL RIGHT, WOULD YOU GO OVER HERE TO THE LEFT, PARK THE TRUCK, - AND UNLOAD THE HORSE FOR ME, PLEASE? - SURE THING. MONTE, I WANT YOU TO WATCH ME. KNOCK YOURSELF OUT. AIN'T HE A BEAUTY, OFFICER? THEY ALL LOOK THE SAME TO ME. THEY DO, HUH? HOW DUMB CAN YOU GET? THESE PAPERS SAY TWO WHITE BACK FEET. I ONLY SEE ONE WHITE BACK FOOT. MAYBE YOU OUGHTA LOOK A LITTLE HARDER. THOSE ARE THE CORRECT PAPERS. SAY, HAVEN'T YOU EVER DONE THIS BEFORE? WHAT'S THIS ON HIS LEG? LOOKS LIKE BLOOD. THAT'S THE REASON I COULDN'T SEE HIS WHITE MARKING. LOOK, YOUR GUESS IS AS GOOD AS MINE, YOU KNOW? MAYBE THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT IS. HORSES ARE MORE CARELESS THAN KIDS. THE FACT IS I DON'T EVEN WANNA TALK ABOUT IT. I JUST WANNA GET BACK TO THE U.S. OF A., ALL RIGHT, AND GET DOWN THE ROAD. NOW EITHER LET US GO THROUGH OR THROW US IN JAIL FOR SMUGGLING BLOOD. CHOP-CHOP, BUDDY. WELCOME HOME. DIDN'T YOU SEE MY PASSPORT? THIS AIN'T HOME. IT'S FUCKING ARIZONA. WHY DON'T YOU HAVE A TURKISH FIG, BUDDY? YOU'RE GONNA FEEL A LOT BETTER. GO AHEAD. YOU DO THESE THINGS BECAUSE YOU FEEL YOU HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE. YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT THE NICE THINGS IN LIFE, KENNY. I WISH TO HELL YOU'D JUST DROP OUT OF THE PROJECT. LET THOSE OF US WITH A FEW IDEALS REAP THE BENEFITS. LOOK, ARE YOU TRYING TO GET RID OF ME? - ( scoffs ) - I'M WILLING TO TAKE ALL THE RISKS AND-- AND MURDER PEOPLE, ET CETERA, AND THIS IS THE THANKS THAT I GET? I SURE AS HELL NEVER ASKED YOU TO MURDER ANYBODY. I'LL NEVER FIGURE THAT ONE OUT IF I LIVE TO BE A MILLION. MAUREEN SAYS THIS TIME YOU'RE NOT GETTING OUT OF MARRYING HER. SHE SAYS THIS TIME-- THIS TIME YOU'RE IN IT FOR LIFE. SHE SAYS NO ROUTINE CAPERS. THIS TIME IT'S FOR REAL. KENNY, SHE SAID TO ME, "THIS TIME I'M BURNING BRIDGES." HAS MAUREEN EVER MENTIONED MY LITTLE DAUGHTER ROSEMARY TO YOU? PLENTY OF TIMES. YOU'RE ALL GONNA LIVE TOGETHER AFTER THE WEDDING. - THE WEDDING. - THE WEDDING, MONTE. HEAR MY WORDS, WATCH MY LIPS-- THE WEDDING. Maureen: KENNY! OVER HERE! BLESS YOUR HEART, KENNY. YOU'RE ON TIME. WHERE'S MONTE? MONTE'S WITH THE HORSE OVER BY THE POWER TERMINAL. - SCOOT OVER. I'M DRIVING. - AS YOU WISH. I REALLY LOVE DRIVING THIS THING. - SCOOT OVER. - OH. WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE ANY TROUBLE PULLING THAT HORSE TRAILER WITH THIS BABY. IT'S A REGULAR LOCOMOTIVE. Maureen: I GOT RESERVATIONS AT A CAMPGROUND WITH PHONE HOOKUPS AND EVERYTHING. YOU CAN TALK TO THE FENCE RIGHT FROM THE R.V. THEN WE'LL DELIVER THE HORSE TO HIS DOOR IN NEVADA. HEY, MONTE! MONTE! - HEY, COWBOY! - HONEY, WHERE ARE YOU? HUH, WHERE THE HELL IS HE? MONTE! CURSES! - WHAT? - ( speaks gibberish ) MONTE TOOK THE HORSE! - WHAT DO YOU MEAN? - I MEAN, MONTE MUST DIE! I AGREE WITH YOU. MONTE IS DEAD. - ( screams ) I BELIEVE HE MUST PASS AWAY IN A RATHER CRUEL FASHION. AND, MIGHT I ADD, HE HAS BROKEN MY HEART. ( crying ) WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS HOW'D HE DRIVE AWAY AND RIDE AWAY AT THE SAME TIME? WHAT DO YOU MEAN? HEY, LINDY, MONTE LATHAM HERE. OKAY. LISTEN, YOU STILL FLYING? YEAH? WELL, LISTEN, I GOT A LITTLE JOB FOR YOU. - KENNY, PUT THAT PHONE DOWN. - I WANNA CALL MY MOM. FORGET IT. APPALLING THAT A FELLA LIKE YOU EVEN HAS ONE. YOU LEAVE MY MOTHER OUT OF THIS. NOW, COME ON, WE GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE. I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET ANYWHERE WITH THE BRAND INSPECTION OFFICE. ONCE THE HORSE IS IN THE COUNTRY, MONTE COULD TAKE HIM ANYWHERE, AND THE FENCE HASN'T HEARD FROM HIM, EITHER. MAUREEN, WHY DID YOU TRUST HIM? WHY? I DON'T KNOW WHY. I'M SOFT ON HIM. WHEN A PERSON PLANS TO MARRY SOMEONE, YOU LOSE PERSPECTIVE. WELL, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO PUT THAT LITTLE FIRE OUT, MAUREEN, OR WE AIN'T GONNA GET OUR DEAL DONE. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? MEANING... WHERE DOES HIS LITTLE GIRL LIVE? FORGET IT! I'M THE GODMOTHER. THAT'S ROSEMARY. FORGET IT! WELL, MAUREEN, SOMETIMES I WONDER IF YOU'RE EVEN A CRIMINAL. ( sighs ) ALL RIGHT, DARN IT TO HECK. ROSEMARY GOES TO BOARDING SCHOOL IN STEAMBOAT SPRINGS, COLORADO. SURVIVAL AND CRAFTS MAJOR. COME ON, KENNY, LET'S GO. YOU SMOKE CIGARS? NO, I DON'T SMOKE NOTHING ANYMORE, NOT SINCE THE SURGEON GENERAL'S REPORT. WHEN WAS THAT? '62. BAD DAMN YEAR FOR SMOKERS. YOU GONNA JUST RIDE ON OUT OF HERE? I WILL RIDE HIM TO THE FAMILY RANCH-- DEADROCK, MONTANA, NOW OPERATED BY MY BROTHER BUCK LATHAM AND HIS WIFE LAURA. THIS HANDSOME DEVIL IS GONNA KEEP THOSE TWO SORRY BASTARDS FROM STARVING TO DEATH. Buck's voice: YOU CAN'T BLAME A MAN FOR TRYING TO START A NEW LIFE, BUT MOST TIMES THAT OLD LIFE IS JUST TOO NASTY TO FORGIVE. MAUREEN MUST HAVE KNOWN THAT A SUREFIRE WAY OF GETTING TO MONTE WAS THROUGH HIS KID ROSEMARY. BUT HOW FAR WOULD SHE GO WITH A KID TO GET MONTE BACK? NOW WHAT DO I DO? SNEAK UP? NO, NO, JUST STAND BACK OF MY HEAD. NOW, WHEN I SAY WHEN, JUST DROP THE KNIFE RIGHT FOR MY THROAT. WHAT'S THE POINT IN THIS? WELL, I CAN SEE UP YOUR DRESS, FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH. SAY WHEN. WHEN. YOU EVER THINK ABOUT ETERNITY, KENNY? HMM. ONLY FOR MY VICTIMS. WELL, THAT'S NICE AND SIMPLE. YOU KNOW... I MAY BE DEEPER THAN YOU REALIZE, MAUREEN. ACTUALLY, I THINK OF MYSELF AS, WELL, EXECUTIVE MATERIAL. ( sighs ) I DON'T WANNA GROW OLD AS JUST ANOTHER MURDERER. I MEAN, I'M A PROFESSIONAL, BUT NOBODY TAKES ME SERIOUSLY. I'M PREPARED TO TAKE YOU SERIOUSLY. BUT YOU NEVER REALLY GIVE ME ROOM TO SHOW MY STUFF. WELL, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT-- TOMORROW AT THE EQUESTRIAN REGISTRY, YOU HANDLE IT. I'LL JUST LISTEN. I'LL BE THE LITTLE WIFE AND YOU BE THE TAKEOVER GUY. HOW'S THAT? ( horn blaring ) Buck's voice: LAURA AND I HAD MANAGED TO GET ABOUT NECK DEEP IN DEBT. A CHAMPEEN STALLION WAS THE ANSWER TO OUR DREAMS, EVEN IF MONTE CAME WITH IT. BUCK, BUCK, BUCK, BUCK, MONTE'S HERE. ALL RIGHT! HE'S SKINNIER, BUT IT'S WONDERFUL TO SEE HIM, ISN'T IT? THAT MUST BE THE CHAMPION STUD, HUH? - THINK SO? - CAN YOU BELIEVE HE RODE HERE? NOW, BE NICE, LAURA. HEY! - HI, MONTE. - HEY, HEY, YOU HILLBILLY SONS OF BITCHES. WE'RE GONNA GET SOMEWHERES. - THIS PLACE IS GONNA BE A STALLION STATION, HUH? - LOOK AT THAT! NOW, BEFORE YOU LOOK AT THE HORSE, MONTE HAS SOME GOODIES. NOW, LAURA, JUST 'CAUSE YOU WAS ALWAYS SO SUSPICIOUS OF ME, HERE'S SOME OUT OF SIGHT ZUNI TURQUOISE FOR YOU ANYWAY. BUCK, GOD DAMN IT. HERE'S SOME SILVER-MOUNTED HANDMADE SPURS FROM BEAUTIFUL DOWNTOWN SOUTH TEXAS. WHAT? SPIN THEM ROWELS, BUCK. THEY'LL SPIN TILL TOMORROW. - DAMN. - YEAH. - THANKS, MONTE. - 18-POINT ROWELS. YOU STICK YOUR HORSE WITH THEM, HE'LL JUMP OVER THE MOON. NOW, FRIENDS AND RELATIVES, LET'S VIEW THE HORSE. - COME ON. - NICE. MONTE, HE IS SOMETHING ELSE. I TOLD YOU HE'S A CADILLAC. HE'S A REINING MACHINE UNDER THE SADDLE. - WAIT TILL YOU GET ON HIM. HE'S GOT A DIME STOP. - MM! LAURA, WAIT'LL YOU GET ON THIS SUCKER. YOU'LL SEE HOW DOG GENTLE AND LAW-ABIDING HE IS. YOU'RE GONNA TAKE ONE LOOK AT OLD MONTE AND SAY, "YOU KNOW, I ALWAYS THOUGHT HE WAS THE BLACK SHEEP OF THE FAMILY, BUT MAYBE MONTE'S OKAY." TIME WILL TELL, MONTE. TIME WILL TELL. - OH, THANK GOD. - ( laughing ) DON'T FORGET, I'M IN CHARGE. NOW, NOW, REMEMBER, BE VERY AUTHORITATIVE. - STAND TALL, OKAY? - MM-HMM. WATCH ME. ( keyboard clicking ) Kenny: TOP OF THE MORNING TO YOU, LADIES. - I'M LOOKING FOR A HORSE. - WELL, BLESS YOUR HEART. WE HAVE OVER A MILLION IN OUR COMPUTERS. ANY HORSE IN PARTICULAR? WELL, THIS IS A PRETTY BIG ONE, WITH BALLS ALMOST AS BIG AS MINE. YOU'LL HAVE TO FORGIVE MY NEPHEW. HE USED TO BE A BLACKSMITH, AND SOMEBODY ACCIDENTALLY DROPPED AN ANVIL ON HIS HEAD FROM THE ROOF OF THE PARKING GARAGE. THE HORSE IS REGISTERED UNDER THE NAME OF INFIDEL, REGISTRATION NUMBER 179583, FOALED IN AZURE SPRINGS, NEW MEXICO, 1983. HE'S BAY. EXCUSE ME JUST A SECOND. I'M GONNA HAVE TO PULL THIS OFF THE COMPUTER. "EXECUTIVE MATERIAL." YOU SLAY ME. YOU NEVER GAVE ME A CHANCE. - I GAVE YOU ALL THE CHANCE THAT YOU WERE GONNA GET. - ( scoffs ) IF I WENT AND BOUGHT A VIBRATOR AND LEARNED HOW TO SHOOT, I WOULDN'T NEED YOU AT ALL. I AM SO SORRY TO HAVE TO TELL YOU THIS, BUT THE OWNER OF RECORD HAS CABLED US THAT THE HORSE IS DECEASED. WHAT? WHO IS THE OWNER OF RECORD, MAY I ASK? MONTE LATHAM. RING ANY BELLS? - YES, I'M AFRAID IT DOES. ARE YOU BY ANY CHANCE MAUREEN? - YES, I AM. THE CABLE SAYS TO TELL YOU "BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME." - THANK YOU. - MOTHER! AAH! SHIT. - SOUNDS LIKE HE DID THE HORSE IN! - SHH, KENNY! I NEVER THOUGHT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING FOR THE HORSE. I THOUGHT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING FOR MONTE. GET THE JEWELS OUT OF HIM THE SAME WAY WE WERE GONNA GET 'EM OUT OF THE HORSE. KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN, KENNY. WE DON'T WANNA BE STANDING AROUND DOWN HERE IN TEXAS RAVING LIKE A COUPLE OF GANGSTERS. STOP CALMING ME DOWN. COWBOYS! I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW, MAUREEN, WHEN I FIND THAT PRICK, I'M GONNA TAKE A LINOLEUM KNIFE AND CARVE HIM A BRAND-NEW ASSHOLE. I AM NOT AGAINST IT. HONESTLY, I'M NOT. AM I RIGHT IN CONCLUDING WE'RE HEADED FOR STEAMBOAT SPRINGS? WHERE ELSE? I LONG TO HOLD MY GODDAUGHTER IN MY VERY OWN ARMS. COME ON! NOW WE GO TO THE MORMON TEMPLE VISITORS' CENTER WHERE THEY HAVE A NICE GREEN LAWN. - YOU CAN PLAY GOLF THERE. - I'M GONNA HIT SOME BALLS RIGHT HERE. KENNY, STOP IT. WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE? SAM SNEED? "DEAR MOMMY, I HAVE BEEN PROMOTED TO CHIEF EXECUTIVE BRANCH MANAGER..." I'LL SHOOT YOU LIKE A RABBIT! "...IN CHARGE OF THE ENTIRE SOUTHWEST. YOUR LOVING SON, POOKIE." AAH! Maureen: KENNY, YOU'D MAKE A GREAT EXECUTIVE. KENNY, I'M SORRY! STOP THE CAR. PLEASE. KENNY! YOU'RE WONDERFUL. AS WE MAKE OUR WAY INTO THE HEART OF THE COUNTRY, WE MUST REMEMBER TO NEVER APPEAR CONSPICUOUS BECAUSE THESE HERE ARE HICK TOWNS, AND HICKS HAVE A WAY OF NOTING-- I MEAN, NOTICING STRANGERS. I MEAN, STRANGERS. OOH, MY SKIN FEELS SO ALIVE. JUST FORGET IT, MAUREEN. - WATCH YOURSELF, BOY. - OH, I WILL. NOW, WHY DON'T YOU GO IN THE BACK AND TURN ON THE TV? ( TV audience cheering ) - Hi, Romy. How are you? - Good. How are you? I'm fine, thanks. You've got your flats on. You're taller than-- stand up just a minute-- I AM BORED TO DEATH - OF DRIVING, DRIVING, DRIVING! - AAH. ( tires screeching ) ( laughing ) I'LL TELL YOU WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO. YOU'RE GONNA STOP IN THIS NEXT TOWN, YOU'RE GONNA GET ME SOMEBODY NOW. NO WAY. NO, WHY? 'CAUSE THE NEXT TOWN IS NOTHING BUT A RADIUM MINE. YOU'RE GONNA GET 40 DIRTY RADIUM MINERS IF YOU GET ONE. - WELL, IT'S YOU, HITMAN. - NO WAY IN HELL, MAUREEN. GO SIT ON THE WHEEL WELL AND FEEL THE BUMPY ROAD, WILL YA? I'LL REMEMBER THIS IN THE MORNING. MAUREEN, YOU'RE NOT GONNA REMEMBER A THING IN THE MORNING. AND IF I THOUGHT YOU WOULD, I'D GET YOU THEM RADIUM MINERS. LISTEN TO ME, YOU'RE GONNA BE WONDERING WHY YOUR ASS IS GLOWING IN THE DARK. ( laughs ) ( thunder crashes ) TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON. ALL RIGHT, HERE, LISTEN. WE'RE HEADED FOR THE SURVIVAL SCHOOL. STEAMBOAT SPRINGS, RIGHT HERE. NOW LISTEN-- MAUREEN, GET IT TOGETHER. I HAVE IT TOGETHER. I'M THE FAIRY GODMOTHER. YOU'RE THE FAIRY GODMOTHER. YOU CAN'T GO WALKING INTO A SCENE LIKE THAT LOOKING LIKE A KIDNAPPER. BUT I AM A KIDNAPPER. TAKE IT FROM ME, DON'T ACT LIKE IT, OR IT DOESN'T WORK! ROSEMARY'S GONNA BE SO TICKLED TO SEE ME. WE HAVE SUCH A BEAUTIFUL RELATIONSHIP. ALL RIGHT NOW, THIS TIME I'M GONNA SHOW YOU HOW IT'S DONE. MM-HMM. NOW JUST SIT BACK, KENNY. KEEP THE MOTOR RUNNING AND DON'T INTERFERE. AND BEFORE YOU KNOW IT, WE'RE GONNA BE ONE STEP CLOSER TO MONTE. OKAY, I WANT 50 SIT-UPS STARTING NOW. LET'S GO! ONE AND TWO AND THREE AND FOUR. - MISS! HI, I WONDER IF YOU COULD HELP ME OUT WITH A LITTLE FAVOR. I'M HERE TO SEE ROSEMARY LATHAM, MY GODDAUGHTER. I GOT SOME PRESENTS FOR HER DOWN THERE IN MY RECREATIONAL VEHICLE. MA'AM, I'M AFRAID ROSEMARY'S NOT HERE ANYMORE. WAIT A MINUTE. WHERE ARE YOU GETTING THIS FROM? THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED. WELL, WHERE THE HELL YOU SENDING HER LESSON PLANS TO? TO HER UNCLE'S RANCH IN DEADROCK, MONTANA, IF IT'S ANY BUSINESS OF YOURS. - REALLY? WELL, TRY THIS ON FOR SIZE! - UGH! HA! ( screaming ) KENNY, HELP! KENNY, HELP! KENNY! KENNY! - KENNY! - ( toy guns rattling ) KENNY! AHH! KENNY! KENNY! KENNY! ( gunshot ) CHILDREN, FREEZE! FREEZE! I WANNA SEE HANDS! KENNY IS VERY ANGRY! DROP IT! - OH, MY KENNY, MY HERO. - DROP IT! OH, KENNY. FREEZE! DEADROCK-- HE'S IN DEADROCK. LITTLE SHITS. THERE YOU GO, BIG GUY. COME LET THEM GIRLS KNOW WHO YOU ARE. NOT THAT THEY WOULDN'T FIND OUT SOON ENOUGH, OF COURSE. - NOW DON'T EMBARRASS HIM, LAURA. - OH. WHEW! YOU KNOW, WE'RE STARTING TO LOOK LIKE A FIRST-CLASS OPERATION HERE. I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE IT, BUCK. THINGS HAVE BEEN SO ROUGH AROUND HERE. AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN, POOF. IF THIS HORSE IS HALF THE SIRE THAT MONTE SAYS HE IS... - YEAH. - ...AND WE GET, LIKE, MAYBE TWO-THIRDS - OF THE MARES IN FOAL... - YEAH. ...I THINK WE GOT A CHANCE OF MAKING A GO OF IT HERE. YEAH! YEAH! AND THEN YOU THINK MAYBE WE COULD GET STARTED ON THAT HERD OF OUR OWN? OH, YEAH. DOC, MONTE LATHAM. HOW'D YOU LIKE TO PERFORM A LITTLE MINOR SURGERY FOR A MAJOR FEE? UH-HUH. Kenny: I WONDER IF THEY'VE STARTED HUNTING FOR THE GUY WHO KILLED THAT GREEDY VETERINARIAN YET. YOU KNOW, THEY'RE GONNA BE LOOKING FOR YOU, HITMAN, BECAUSE ME AND MONTE AREN'T KNOWN TO THEM. HEY, MAUREEN, I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE LOOKING FOR ME OR NOT, BUT, FRANKLY, I'M REALLY NOT WORRIED ABOUT IT. AFTER ALL THE FOLKS YOU'VE KILLED? YOU ARE REALLY FUNNY. YOU ARE A MANIAC. THAT'S RIGHT, YOU'RE A MANIAC. DO YOU KNOW THE AVERAGE AMERICAN HAS NEVER SEEN A MANIAC EXCEPT ON THE TV NEWS? BUT I HAVE. I'VE SEEN YOU. MAUREEN, MY MOTTO IS DON'T GET MAD, TURN PRO. PLEASE DON'T OFFER ME THAT PIG SHIT. PIG SHIT INDEED. YOU KNOW, I WAS NEVER REALLY MAD AT ANY OF THOSE PEOPLE. IT WAS JUST LIKE HOLDING A GUN UP TO A CANTALOUPE. AND THEN SOME OF THE NEW IMPROVEMENTS ARE REALLY GREAT. WITH THE NEW MODERN SILENCERS-- A .357 MAGNUM WITH A SILENCER SOUNDS JUST LIKE A MOUSE FART. YOU HARDLY FEEL LIKE YOU'VE DONE ANYTHING WRONG WHEN YOU MADE A LITTLE MOUSE FART AT A GUY'S HEAD. IT REALLY SHOULD BE JUST LIKE A PARKING TICKET. GOD, I LOVE MY WORK. Maureen: YOU KNOW, KENNY, HE WAS MY NUMBER ONE MAN. HE WAS MY FIANCE AND HE STOLE EVERYTHING I HAD. TO BE WELL FED AND HAPPILY MARRIED WAS THE ONLY DREAM I EVER HAD. KENNY, FIX ME SOMETHING NICE TO EAT. - DO I HAVE TO COOK NOW? - PRETTY PLEASE? MAUREEN, I AM SICK AND TIRED OF COOKING, I AM SICK AND TIRED OF EATING, AND I AM SICK AND TIRED OF YOU WATCHING ME AS IF I'M EATING ALL OF YOUR FOOD. OH, I HURT YOUR FEELINGS, DIDN'T I, KENNY, WITH ALL MY LITTLE REQUESTS. I KNOW YOU, KENNY. YOU WANNA SPREAD YOUR WINGS AND YOU WANNA KILL SOMEONE. WELL, JUST BE A TINY BIT PATIENT FOR ME, OKAY? OKAY. LET'S HAVE A LITTLE TURKISH FIG. I SAID FIX ME SOMETHING NICE. ( glass shatters ) YOU KNOW, IT JUST HIT ME. WHAT HIT YOU? WHY I'M NOT TOO COMFORTABLE WITH THIS-- YOU KNOW, WITH MONTE. I THOUGHT THIS WAS YOUR DREAM, BUCK. I THOUGHT WE WERE RESURRECTING YOUR WAYWARD BROTHER AND GETTING TO STAY ON THE PLACE. WE ARE, BUT IT'S JUST BEEN TOO EASY. TOO EASY, FOR WHOM? YOU? NO, IT HASN'T BEEN EASY FOR ME. IT'S BEEN EASY FOR MONTE. WELL, HE'S AT HOME, HE'S DOING HIS VARIOUS DEALS, BUT IT JUST-- IT MAKES WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE LOOK PRETTY MENIAL. THAT'S RIGHT, BUCK. THAT IS JUST ABOUT EXACTLY THE WAY THAT I SEE IT. I GUESS IT TOOK ME A LITTLE WHILE TO FIGURE IT OUT, THAT'S ALL. Monte: HEY, LAURA, LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING. HOW'D YOU FEEL ABOUT OLD MONTE CALLING OUT FOR A GIRL? A WHAT? YOU KNOW, A PROSTITUTE. COME ON, MONTE. I'M A LONELY SUCKER, LAURA. I'M A PRETTY SOLITARY BOOGER. - I NEED A HOME. - FOR YOU AND THIS HOOKER? - MM-HMM. - ( chuckling ) ( Buck clears throat ) I GOTTA GO. Monte: WHAT DID I SAY? GOOD-FOR-NOTHING LOWLIFE SWINDLER. COULDN'T PAY A PROSTITUTE ENOUGH TO GO TO BED WITH HIM, THAT UGLY DOG. Maureen: I WANTED MONTE TO MARRY ME. I ALWAYS LOVED MONTE. EVERY GIRL HAS A DREAM, KENNY. AND MINE HAS ALWAYS BEEN TO FIND ME A COMPLETELY DISHONEST COWBOY LIKE MONTE. Maureen: HE WOULDN'T MARRY ME. HE LET ME EAT ALL I WANTED, BUT HE WOULDN'T MARRY ME. AND NOW... I HURT VERY MUCH BECAUSE MONTE WOULD NEVER MARRY ME. ( crying ) ( both crying ) YOU KNOW WHAT, KENNY, I THINK HE'S GONNA GO SOMEWHERE, AND HE'S GONNA TAKE THE JEWELS AND THE MONEY, AND HE'S GONNA THROW 'EM AWAY BECAUSE HE CANNOT DEAL WITH MY LIBERATION. ( grunts ) DO YOU HAVE THOUGHTS ABOUT ME? YOU KNOW, THAT SHAKE YOU UP? YEAH, I DO, MONTE. I DO. FEEL LIKE SHARING THEM? WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO? YEAH, IT COULD BE REAL NICE, LAURA. ALL RIGHT, MONTE, I WILL. I CAN'T HELP FEELING A BIT-- BE BRAVE, LAURA, JUST SAY IT RIGHT OUT. I CAN'T HELP FEELING THAT YOU'RE STILL VERY MUCH OF A SWINDLER, MONTE. - A SWINDLER? - LIKE YOU ALWAYS WERE. WELL, MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THAT. BUT, HELL, LAURA, EVEN A SWINDLER GETS HOMESICK. I'M S-- I'M SORRY, MONTE. BUT, LOOK, MORE IMPORTANT, MY DAUGHTER'S COMING AT 2:00. - ROSEMARY? - UH-HUH. I HAVEN'T SEEN ROSEMARY SINCE SHE WAS ABOUT-- - SHE'S NINE YEARS OLD. - NINE YEARS OLD? - YOU BELIEVE THAT? - WOW. BUT I JUST WANTED TO CHECK WITH YOU AND MAKE SURE IT WAS GONNA BE OKAY. OH, MONTE... IT'S OKAY, MONTE. JUST GIVE ME HALF A CHANCE, LAURA. JUST HALF A CHANCE. I MEAN, I REALLY WANNA MAKE SOMETHING OUT OF THIS. BUT I'D FORGET ABOUT THAT PROSTITUTE IF I WERE YOU. - ( horn honks ) - Man: LOOK OUT. Kenny: I HATE THIS OUTFIT. I SAID IN THE VERY BEGINNING, IF YOU WEREN'T WILLING TO MELT IN THE BACKGROUND, THEN WE WEREN'T GOING TO MONTANA. I LOOK LIKE GENE AUTRY. SO RUN FOR GOVERNOR. WHOO! AH! COME ON. ( laughs ) Monte: ♪ MY LUCK NEVER CHANGES ♪ ♪ I JUMPED ON MY HORSE AND I GALLOPED AWAY ♪ ♪ SINGING KI-YI-YIPPIE ♪ ♪ GET ALONG, LITTLE DOGIES ♪ ♪ THE STATE OF MONTANA WILL BE YOUR NEW HOME. ♪ ROSEMARY WILL ARRIVE RIGHT OVER THERE, A 2:00 TRAIN. MONTE'S GONNA PICK HER UP. ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS FOLLOW MONTE, AND WE'LL WATCH FROM THIS BAR RIGHT HERE. ( country music playing ) - HOWDY, BOYS! YEE-HA! - COOL IT! - MAY I HELP YOU? - YES, I'D LIKE A VODKA WITH A TWIST. DRAFT BEER HERE, BUDDY. AND HOW ABOUT A COUPLE OF SHIRLEY TEMPLES FOR THE HOMOSEXUALS THERE? A WHAT? - WHAT DID HE SAY? - YEE-HA! - ( grunts ) HE'S BEEN LIKE THAT SINCE THE WAR. HEY, BUCK, ARE YOU GONNA LET THEM STAY? WELL, EMMETT, THAT'S UP TO THEM. COME ON, BOYS. HERE'S TWO TOURISTS. - ANYBODY HOME? - ( laughs ) - ( growls ) - OOH! I AM TERRIBLY SORRY. - KENNY, SAY SOMETHING. - YOU KNOW, I'M SORRY, TOO. Maureen: WE JUST WANTED TO HAVE A COUPLE DRINKS AND WATCH THE PASSING SCENE OUT YOUR FRONT WINDOW. YOU DRINK UP, HMM? I DON'T WANT YOUR BUSINESS TOO BAD. WE'D REALLY LIKE TO STAY A LITTLE BIT LONGER. IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO TO MAKE UP FOR MY NEPHEW? STOP IT. YEAH, YOU CAN PAY FOR THOSE FELLAS' DRINKS. IT'S A DEAL. WE CAN STAY LONGER THEN, RIGHT? - THAT'S RIGHT. - GOT YOURSELF A DEAL.

MAUREEN, PLEASE, THIS MOMENT BELONGS TO ME. YOU'RE LIKE A CHEERLEADER WITH ALL THESE ENTHUSIASMS, KENNY. WE SHOULD SEND YOU TO THE ROSE BOWL AND LET YOU KILL COEDS. MONTE AND I HAVE SURVIVED A JILLION MISUNDERSTANDINGS. I CAN'T HAVE YOU KILL MY FIANCE. I HAVE TO LEARN TO ACCEPT HIS IDIOSYNCRASIES. AND SO DO YOU. THAT'S WHAT LOVE IS ALL ABOUT. BESIDES, I'VE CHANGED MY MIND. I WANT MONTE TO GO ON LIVING THE LIFE OF A CHARMING BUT DISHONEST COWBOY. YOU MAKE ME SICK! THIS IS LOVE, ISN'T IT, MONTE? - THE REAL THING. - OH, IT SURE IS. I LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOU, TOO. YOU KNOW, SOMEHOW, I'VE GIVEN YOU PEOPLE THE FEELING THAT YOU CAN USE ME, THAT YOU CAN DANCE KENNY AROUND. I HAVE JUST COMPLETED THE MOST BORING 2,000-MILE TRIP FOR THE EXPRESS PURPOSE OF KILLING THIS FOUR-FLUSHER. YOU ARE UNPROFESSIONAL. BUT I WANNA KNOW WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THE RIGHTS OF THE INDIVIDUAL IN THIS COUNTRY. HMM! THIS TIME, SWEETIE... YOU HAVEN'T BEEN HONEST WITH ME. WE ALWAYS DID EVERYTHING ON A HANDSHAKE.

YEAH, WE'D WANNA MAKE SURE WE DID THAT, OR WE MIGHT LOSE THE HORSE. TRUCK COMES THROUGH ABOUT MIDDAY. BEFORE THEY GET TO MOVING AROUND, MAYBE YOU COULD PUT INFIDEL OFF SOMEWHERES WHERE NOBODY'S LIKELY TO STUMBLE ON HIM, YOU KNOW, JUST TILL YOU GET A CHANCE TO HAUL HIM AWAY. YOU'RE REAL SURE ABOUT THIS OWNERSHIP, RIGHT? OH, SURE AS SHOOT. - SURE AS SHOOT. - OKAY. I'LL TRY TO KEEP THEM OCCUPIED. - A FELLA NAME OF KENNY. - KENNY? YEAH, AND A, WELL, PRETTY NICE GAL.

AND WHILE YOU'RE GETTING A MINISTER TODAY, PREFERABLY NON-DENOMINATIONAL, MONTE AND I AND ROSEMARY ARE GONNA BE HAVING AN ORDINARY FAMILY DAY. AH. WELL, DAMN, IT'S A SHAME 'CAUSE HE LOOKS GOOD. HE'S FOUNDERED, THOUGH, HUH? THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED, BOB. APPRECIATE IT IF YOU KEEP A LOW PROFILE ON THIS. I'LL TAKE CARE OF HIM, BUCK. - YOU'LL NEED TO BRING ME THE BILL OF SALE. - THAT'S NO PROBLEM. JUST A COUPLE OF DAYS AND I'LL DRAW YOU A CHECK.

WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT? - JEEZ, HAVE YOU GOT YOUR DATE SELECTED? - THIS EVENING. BOY, THAT'S FAST. WHERE'S IT GONNA BE AT? HERE. WE HOPE THAT'S OKAY WITH YOU. - WE DON'T WANNA INTERFERE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. SURE. PUT ME ON THE DECORATING COMMITTEE. I'VE SENT MY AIDE DE CAMP TO TOWN TO GET A MAN OF THE CLOTH. - IT'S GONNA BE A VERY, VERY QUIET CEREMONY. I'LL SAY. YEAH, BUT DIGNIFIED, YOU KNOW? WELL, THAT'S GOOD. WELL, CONGRATULATIONS. THANK YOU. BYE. OH, DAMN. YOU REMEMBER ME? $400 LIZARD BOOTS. HOW COME YOU'RE NOT WEARING THEM? WELL, I BOUGHT 'EM FOR A SPECIAL OCCASION. AND I BET YOU THOUGHT I CAME DOWN HERE TO RETURN 'EM, DIDN'T YOU?

CAN YOU POINT ME IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION? NOW, YOU KNOW, I THINK JUST MAYBE I CAN. - LET ME MAKE A QUICK CALL. - THANK YOU. JERRY, THIS IS WILEY DOWN AT THE WESTERN STORE. THERE WAS A FELLA WHO STOPPED IN YESTERDAY ABOUT A PAIR - OF SIZE 10D LIZARD BOOTS. - WHAT'S THAT GOTTA DO WITH IT? HE'S LOOKING FOR A NON-DENOMINATIONAL PREACHER TO MARRY HIS LADY FRIEND. HMM. WHERE? BUCK LATHAM'S RANCH TONIGHT. BUCK LATHAM'S TONIGHT. OKAY, OKAY, I'LL TELL HIM. WELL, NOW HE'D JUST BE GLAD TO DO IT. HE'D LIKE FOR YOU TO STOP BY AND FILL OUT A FEW FORMS. LET ME JUST MAKE YOU ANOTHER MAP. ( knocking at door ) JUST A MINUTE. I'M TAKING A PISS. ( knocking ) I'LL BE RIGHT WITH YOU. - ARE YOU THE MINISTER? - AT YOUR SERVICE, SON. - MAY I COME IN? - YOU BET. IT'S EMPTY AS HELL IN HERE-- I MEAN, HECK IN HERE. WE LIKE TO MINIMIZE THE BODILY COMFORTS. PLEASE BE SEATED. MAY I HAVE YOUR NAME, PLEASE? WHAT'S MY NAME HAVE TO DO WITH IT? IS IT A PROBLEM? NO. KENNY. THAT'S KENNETH PRUITT. - THAT'S T-T? - T-T. COULD I HAVE YOUR DRIVERS LICENSE? LOOK, I DON'T SEE WHAT THAT HAS TO DO WITH THIS. JUST GIVE ME THE LICENSE. I WORK FOR GOD, SON. HE DON'T LIKE ME FOOLING AROUND. THANK YOU. YOU'RE THE FIRST PERSON FROM DELAWARE I'VE EVER MET. WHAT TIME YOU WANT ME OUT THERE AT THE LATHAM PLACE? LET'S SAY 7:00, HUH? YOU DON'T WANNA KNOW THE NAME OF THE BRIDE AND THE GROOM? I'LL FIND THAT OUT WHEN I DO MY NUMBER. IT'S ALL INTERCHANGEABLE. KNOW WHAT I MEAN? WHAT ABOUT BLOOD TESTS? YOU DON'T WANT A BLOOD TEST? NO, WE'RE NON-DENOMINATIONAL. GO WITH GOD, MY BOY. GET TO THIS HORSE AS QUICK AS YOU CAN, DUANE. OLD BUCK'S LIABLE TO CHANGE HIS MIND. THERE ISN'T ANYTHING THE MATTER WITH THIS HORSE, IT LOOKS TO ME. BUCK SAYS HE'S FOUNDERED. HELL, HE AIN'T EVEN NEVER BEEN CUT. HE'S STILL A STUD. I'LL GIVE YOU 40 CENTS A POUND FOR HIM. - 50 AND HE'S YOURS. - BOB, I'M A WORKING MAN. THAT'S RIGHT. YOU'RE BETTER OFF TO KILL THIS HORSE. YOU ABOUT READY? ALMOST. FUNNY THING ABOUT WEDDINGS, EVEN ONE AS RIDICULOUS AS THIS-- - THEY TAKE YOU BACK. - YEP, TO WHEN THINGS WERE SIMPLE. WHICH THEY'RE NOT ANYMORE. ( sighs ) YEAH, I KNOW. THERE'S STILL SOME THINGS THAT ARE GOOD, THOUGH, HUH? - ABOUT MARRIAGE? - YEAH. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT. - ( laughing ) - COME HERE, COWBOY. - WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? - DOLL ME UP, GIRL. - YEAH. - LISTEN, I'M GONNA GO OUT, GET SOME DECORATIONS. - YOU GO ON AHEAD, OKAY? - DON'T YOU LEAVE ME OUT THERE BY MYSELF. I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT THESE THINGS. - ALL RIGHT. - ALL RIGHT. PROMISE? I THINK SO. KENNY, I'LL SHOW YOU MY FAVORITE SPOT. WATCH OUT FOR SNAKES. Buck's voice: IN THE MIDST OF ALL THE ACTIVITY OF GETTING READY FOR THAT WEDDING, I NOTICED KENNY AND ROSEMARY WERE NOWHERE TO BE FOUND. I REMEMBER THINKING THAT THEY HAD GOTTEN SUSPICIOUSLY FRIENDLY. I WANT YOU TO TELL YOUR UNCLE KENNY NOW WHY A HORSE THAT YOU CAN'T EVEN RIDE IS SO PRETTY. Buck's voice: IT MUST HAVE BEEN THEN THAT ROSEMARY TOLD KENNY ABOUT THE STALLION. I CAN'T BLAME THE KID FOR BRAGGING ABOUT THE HORSE. SHE WAS SO DAMN PROUD OF HIM. OH, I FEEL LIKE THE BELLE OF THE BALL. I FEEL LIKE THE TALK OF THE TOWN. BUT MY STOMACH IS GROWLING. - KENNY REFUSES TO DRESS UP. - HE'S JUST JEALOUS. - THINK SO? - I KNOW SO. THE HOLY OCCASION WE ARE ABOUT TO SUBMIT TO WILL LOWER THE CURTAIN FOREVER BETWEEN KENNY AND HIS LUSTFUL DREAMS FOR ME. HOW'S THAT GO AGAIN? OH, HONEY, I SEE A LAVISH SEA CRUISE AND A LITTLE HOUSE, SMALL BUT VERY WELL-EQUIPPED. AND A BIG KITCHEN, AND THEN ONE OF THOSE RESTAURANT STOVES AND A WALK-IN FREEZER. JERRY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? WHY ARE YOU DRESSED LIKE THAT? I COME TO ARREST YOUR HOUSEGUEST. I NEED FOR YOU TO MAKE LIKE I'M THE PREACHER. YEAH, SO ARE THEY ALL CROOKS OR JUST MONTE? - THEY'RE ALL CROOKS. HMM. WELL, WE BETTER LET BUCK KNOW 'CAUSE HE'S GONNA WANNA KNOW ABOUT THAT OUTFIT. THAT'S BUCK'S TRUCK. I WONDER WHERE HE'S HEADED. I HAD A FEELING HE WAS GONNA DUCK OUT. BUCKY JUST HATES ANYTHING TO DO WITH RELIGION. I DO, TOO. WELL, IT'S GONNA SIMPLIFY THINGS. YOU TAKE ME OUT THERE AND INTRODUCE ME TO THE BRIDE AND GROOM. TO MAKE 'EM MISERABLE, I'M JUST GONNA GO RIGHT AHEAD AND MARRY THE BASTARDS. I'M A JUSTICE OF THE PEACE. I CAN MARRY 'EM IF I WANT TO. WHY DON'T YOU HAVE A TURKISH FIG HERE? - NO, THANKS. - HAVE ONE! ALL RIGHT. GOOD EATIN', HUH? DAMN GOOD. - SO WE CLEAR? - YEAH, WE'RE CLEAR. HOW FAR IS THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE? IT'S NOT VERY FAR. THAT HORSE IS GONNA BE THERE, RIGHT? SHOULD BE THERE. TELL ME THE TRUTH OR YOU'RE GONNA GET THE BULLET ALL THESE OTHER PEOPLE DESERVE. HE SHOULD BE IN THE CORRAL. - WHAT IF HE'S NOT? - HE'S IN THE VAT. IF HE'S IN THE VAT, I GUESS WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GET HIM OUT OF THERE, AREN'T WE? MISTER, IF HE'S IN THE VAT, THEN HE'S DEAD. WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES THAT MAKE? - DAMN. - ( laughs ) DEAD OR ALIVE, HUH? I'LL HAVE ME ANOTHER ONE OF THEM. YOU'VE HAD ENOUGH FIGS. OH, WHAT LUCK! MY CATERERS ARE ON TIME. OH, WHAT BEAUTIFUL FOOD. NOW, LISTEN TO ME. I WANT YOU TO SET IT UP LEFT TO RIGHT-- TURKEY, ROAST BEEF, HAM, CHEESE CASSEROLE, FRUIT, SALAD, AND THEN THE DESSERT. VERY IMPORTANT. IF YOU PUT THE DESSERT ON THE LEFT, I AM NOT PAYING FOR THIS. - MONTE, UM, THIS IS-- - COME HERE. MAUREEN, THIS HERE'S THE PREACHER. - SIR, IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU. - HOWDY THERE. HI, MAUREEN. MONTE. - YES, SIR. NOW, FOLKS, I'M JUST A COMMON COWBOY KIND OF PREACHER, AND I DON'T STAND ON CEREMONIES. I LIKE MY WEDDINGS LEGAL AND QUICK, BUT I DO SPRUCE UP FOR THESE DEALS-- WASH MY NECK AND EVERY OTHER DAMN THING. AND TODAY, I GOT A NEW PAIR OF BOOTS TO CELEBRATE YOUR UNION AND GOD. THE KONA LIZARDS, 10D. WHY, THAT'S THE KIND THAT KENNY WEARS. KENNY? WHO'S KENNY? OH, HE'LL BE ALONG AFTER THE CEREMONY. HE'S A LITTLE JEALOUS. HE'S STUCK ON ME, BUT I'M SPOKEN FOR NOW. Buck: ALL RIGHT. - OKAY. - HEY! WHERE'S KENNY'S HORSE? USUALLY THEY KEEP HIM RIGHT HERE. LET'S SEE. OH, SHIT, HE'S GONE. SHIT! THAT HURT. HE'S IN THE VAT. WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO SHUT IT OFF AND LET IT COOL DOWN. IT COULD TAKE ALL NIGHT. YOU'RE IN MY WAY NOW, BUCK. YOU TALK REAL NICE TO KENNY. YOU HEAR ME? OR YOU'RE GONNA GO IN THAT VAT WITH ENOUGH LEAD IN YOU TO MAKE YOU SINK. I JUST WANNA GO BACK TO MY HOUSE. WELL, FOLKS, I HATE TO SAY THIS, BUT I THINK THAT MAYBE WE'D BETTER TAKE A PAUSE AND SEE IF THIS OTHER FELLA SHOWS UP. THIS KENNY MIGHT VOICE SOME OBJECTION. OH, NO, NO, NO. HE WON'T OBJECT AT ALL. WELL... YOU KNOW, KENNY, YOU'RE QUITE A TAKE-CHARGE GUY. KENNY'S SEEN IT ALL. I'VE BEEN A LONG DISTANCE RECONNAISSANCE RANGER AGAINST ANYTHING THAT UNCLE SAM EVER CARED TO CALL AN ENEMY. - HAVE YOU GOT THAT? - DAMN. I MADE 23 CONSECUTIVE HITS. THAT'S AMAZING, KENNY. JUST TURNING ON THE LIGHT. THAT'S BETTER. ISN'T IT? YOU KNOW, KENNY, MY LIFE'S BEEN VERY QUIET, AND I THINK ABOUT ALL THESE THINGS YOU'VE BEEN DOING-- YOU KNOW, MAKES ME FEEL ALMOST ASHAMED. - NO TALKING! - OKAY. Kenny: THAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH THE WORLD TODAY. THERE'S NO MORE PROFESSIONALISM. NO ONE WANTS TO GET THEIR HANDS DIRTY AND NO ONE IS WILLING TO MESS UP THEIR NICE SUITS. YOU TAKE IT EASY THERE. EVERYONE WANTS TO BE LIKED, BUT NO ONE'S WILLING TO TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE BOTTOM LINE. UH-HUH. WELL, THE BUCK STOPS HERE, BUCK. I DON'T SEE MUCH OF ANYTHING LEFT AT ALL IN THERE. YOU KNOW, BUCK, KENNY LOVES A QUIET EVENING. HE LOVES NATIONAL PARKS AND FIRESIDE MEMORIES, BUT MOST OF ALL, BUCK, HE LOVES PEOPLE WHO DON'T LET HIM DOWN. - RIGHT. AND HE LOVES LAUGHTER. AND HE LOVES RADAR TO WATCH THE RUSSIANS WITH. - YEAH. AND HE LOVES TV. - AND KENNY JUST WANTS A CHANCE TO BE A NEIGHBOR. - OH, SURE. YOU'RE PROBABLY WONDERING WHY I'M TELLING YOU ALL THIS. 'CAUSE I NEED YOUR HELP, BUCK, GETTING THIS HORSE OUT OF HERE. I GOTTA KNOW IF I CAN TRUST YOU. ALL RIGHT, KENNY. JUST LET'S TAKE ONE STEP AT A TIME. ALL RIGHT? NOW I'M COMING OVER THERE, AND WE'LL TALK. I CAN HELP YOU, BUT I GOTTA ASK SOMETHING OF YOU FIRST. YOU SEE, OUT HERE WE GOT A CODE-- ONE MAN TO ANOTHER MAN, SO YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO TRUST ME. ( sighs ) ALL RIGHT, I'LL HOLD ON TO THIS FOR YOU. DAMN. PALS? YOU GOT IT. PALS. I GUESS I CAN'T TRUST YOU. OF COURSE YOU CAN. WHAT MAKES YOU SAY THAT? THAT GUN AIN'T EVEN LOADED. THAT'S MONTE'S GUN. GOT MINE RIGHT HERE. I DON'T WANNA TAKE ANY CHANCES. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? NOW, DEARLY BELOVED, BASED ON THE POWER VESTED IN ME BY THE STATE OF MONTANA, I PRONOUNCE YOU MAN AND WIFE. YOU MAY KISS THE BRIDE. EWW. WHERE'S THE FOOD? WE GOT A COUPLE OF FORMALITIES HERE FIRST. MONTE, LET'S START WITH YOU. RAISE YOUR RIGHT HAND. DO YOU SWEAR THAT YOU'RE MONTE LATHAM, - BORN IN DEADROCK, MONTANA, 1947? - YES, I DO. AND YOU, MA'AM, DO YOU SWEAR THAT YOU'RE MAUREEN LINOLEUM LATHAM, BORN IN ENID, OKLAHOMA, 1949? WHERE'D YOU GET THAT BIRTHDATE? NEVER MIND WHERE I GOT IT, SUGAR. HOW DO YOU REPLY? I SWEAR. AND NOW, BASED ON YOUR SWORN TESTIMONY, I PLACE YOU BOTH UNDER ARREST. - ( crying ) OH, DADDY. GIVE ME YOUR LEFT HAND ALSO. I WONDERED ABOUT THOSE BOOTS. HERE, GIVE ME THAT. MA'AM. OKAY. OH, MONTE, I KIND OF LIKE THIS. THERE'S GOTTA BE SOME WAY OF STOPPING THIS THING. YOU KNOW, BUCK, THAT'D BE THE FIRST TIME IN KENNY'S LIFE THAT HE'S FOUND ANYONE HE CAN REALLY TRUST. IT'S A FIRST FOR ME. GOD, IT MAKES ME FEEL ALMOST HUMAN. I FEEL LIKE I COULD JUST LET DOWN A LITTLE BIT. I FEEL LIKE I'VE GOT A FRIEND. - I FEEL LIKE A NEIGHBOR. - ( shouts ) ( screams ) BUCK, IS THAT YOU? OH, I WAS JUST LOOKING FOR THAT OLD HORSE OF MINE. HAD A CHANGE OF HEART, BUT IT APPEARS I'M A LITTLE LATE. - BUCK, I-- - HE WASN'T JUST FOR ME. I GOT THIS LITTLE NIECE WHO'S LOST HER FAMILY AND SHE'S STAYING WITH US NOW. DAMN, SHE LOVED THAT OLD HORSE. TELL YOU WHAT-- SELL HIM BACK TO YOU 50 CENT A POUND. THAT'S NOT FUNNY, DUANE. I GOT HIM OVER TO MY PLACE. IS THAT RIGHT? WELL, DAMN. - ( horn honks ) - Buck: WHOA, WHOA. HEY, MONTE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING BACK THERE? I'M UNDER ARREST. DAMN. I GUESS KENNY RUN OFF WITH YOUR HORSE, HUH? Jerry: WE'LL GET HIM. REALLY SORRY I MISSED THIS WEDDING. I HAD A SHAVING ACCIDENT. I'LL BE BACK SOMEDAY, BUCK. WELL, THE DOOR'S ALWAYS OPEN, BRO. - LOOK AFTER ROSEMARY, WILL YOU? - YOU BETCHA. Jerry: BUCK, I PROMISE YOU THIS-- KENNY WILL BE IN THE CAN BEFORE THE WEEK IS OUT. I'M AS CONFIDENT OF THAT AS YOU ARE, SHERIFF. I WOULDN'T BE SO SURE OF THAT, SHERIFF. KENNY'S FREE. THE DAY WILL COME WHEN HE'LL SET MONTE AND ME FREE, TOO. ( laughs ) THERE YOU GO. Buck's voice: WELL, THAT'S WHERE THE STORY SHOULD END, BUT IT DOESN'T. THE HARDEST THING FOR ME TO ACCEPT ABOUT ALL THIS IS THAT SOME PEOPLE NEVER CHANGE. THE FIRST TIME WE VISITED MONTE IN JAIL, HE STARTED RAVING ABOUT HOW OUR HORSE WAS FULL OF EMERALDS. I HAD TO SMILE AND REMEMBER MY FATHER'S WARNINGS ABOUT MONTE. ONLY HE COULD COME UP WITH SUCH A STORY. I TOLD HIM I GOT TO THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE TOO LATE, BUT TO MAKE HIM FEEL BETTER, OF COURSE, I'D SEND HIM THE MONEY WE GOT PAID FOR THE MEAT. AS FOR OUR NEW EXTENDED FAMILY, ROSEMARY'S GETTING PRETTY HANDY WITH THE HORSES, AND I'M GAINING WEIGHT FROM NOT WORRYING. LAURA WAKES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND STARTS LAUGHING FOR NO REASON. THERE'S NOTHING QUITE LIKE A WOMAN'S LAUGHTER TO TELL YOU YOU'VE DONE THE RIGHT THING. ( instrumental music playing ) DON'T YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T DISPOSE OF KENNY THAT EASILY? ( laughing ) WHY DON'T YOU HAVE A TURKISH FIG? GO AHEAD. ( instrumental music playing )
