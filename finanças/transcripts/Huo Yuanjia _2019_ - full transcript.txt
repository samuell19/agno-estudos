1910 SHANGHAI - Right. - Yes, I heard. - Yes. - I heard about it too. My goodness. What should we do? Someone has to come forward. - My goodness. There are many others. - Right, there are many incredible ones. I know, right? What's going on? There are more amazing ones. Mr. Nong. Chinese martial artists aren't as good as you claim to be. - What is he talking about? - Not good? We don't make judgments with just one person's technique. Master Huo is here. - Master Huo. - Master Huo. - Master Huo. - Master Huo. - Master Huo. - Master Huo. - Master Huo. - Master Huo. Yuanjia, you still came in the end. Jinsun, didn't you say that there are things that one must not do, but there are also things that one must do? All right. Be careful then. - Huo Yuanjia! - Huo Yuanjia! - Huo Yuanjia! - Huo Yuanjia! - Huo Yuanjia! - Huo Yuanjia! I am Huo Yuanjia from Tianjin. Come! 1898 JINGHAI COUNTY, HUO RESIDENCE - Thank you. - This way, please. Master Chen. Thank you. Thank you. Yuanying, congratulations. Thank you. - This way, please. Come in. - Congratulations! Thank you. Sit wherever you like. Yuanying, congratulations. Thank you, Mr. Huang. Come in. Xiaoqi, where's Yuanjia? Why isn't he helping me greet the guests? I think Young Master Yuanjia is in the kitchen. I'll find him. - Go. - Yes. My father will be with us in a minute. Come in. - Here. - All right. Young Master Yuanjia. What are you still doing here? They're looking for you. This is when the broth is in a fierce battle with the heat. It calls for intricate techniques, so I can't take it lightly. Young Master Yuanjia, did you forget to put salt in the broth? Sir. Today is my wedding day. I wonder... HAPPINESS Sir. My son's getting married today. I wonder if we didn't entertain you well. Huo Endi. Do you remember me? Back then, you hurt my father badly. Today, I will avenge my Zhao family's humiliation! Stop! Let him go. Father! You, come with me. Enjoy the banquet. Carry on. - Hurry, clean up the mess. - Carry on. Who taught you martial arts? Do you know why I didn't teach you kung fu? Because your mind is full of hostility! Today, at your brother's wedding reception, - you acted so violently in front of me. - He already came to our home for trouble! He tried to ruin Yuanying's wedding reception and bring disgrace to our family. Do you want me to greet someone like that with a smile and have drinks with him? You unfilial son! How dare you talk back to me? Good virtue is the foundation of martial arts. Martial artists must convince people with good virtue. From now on, reflect on your mistake in front of the memorial tablets of our ancestors. You can only go out when you realize your mistake. I will never realize it! Yuanying isn't as talented as me, yet you chose to teach him Huo's Fist instead of me. You say that good virtue is the foundation of martial arts and choked down insults all these years. Convince people with good virtue? If you really did that back then, why did that man come to seek revenge on Yuanying's wedding day today? Yuanjia. Yuanjia! My dear! FORBIDDEN CITY KUNNING PALACE General Yuan is requesting an audience. I just got reliable information that a Reformist rebel will come to Beijing to see His Majesty via Tianjin. He will arrive there soon. Tianjin is a good place with beautiful scenery. It's a good place to bury him. Yes, Your Majesty. Wait. When you come back, tell them to dust the ashes. We must keep the imperial city pure and clean. Yes, Your Majesty. - Hey! - Load them. - Hurry. - Be careful. Be careful. Be careful! Folks, be careful at work. Don't get yourselves hurt. All right! - Load them to the boat. - Yes. - Slowly. - Come. Take this. Jinsun. We're almost ready. Let the folks have lunch first. - Big! - Big! - Small! - Big! - Big! - Small! Big! Come on, folks. Stop working and have lunch first. You can work hard only when you are full. We still have cargo to unload in a while. Those on the boat, come down too! Don't scramble, folks! Mr. Nong said that everyone will get their share today. Eat your fill! Help yourselves, all right? - All right! - All right! - Come! - Here! Don't scramble. Everyone will get a share. Don't scramble. - Don't scramble. - Step aside. Move! Out of the way! Move! Out of the way! Come on. Move. Step aside. Do you hear me? Step aside. Move! Mr. Nong. You're quite generous. Buns made with fine flour. I think you have earned so much money that you want to burn some. Mr. Yuan, you must be joking. These are some poor folks who never had any fancy food. It's the least I could do for them. The least? This is far from "the least." No wonder people call you a loaded philanthropist. However, what's "the least" you can do for me? I've already prepared it for you. Liu Sheng. Mr. Nong, you're indeed generous. What's on your boat this time? The same as usual. Some medicinal herbs. - Medicinal herbs? - Sir. Ms. Yu. It's rare to see you. Who is this gentleman? Mr. Yuan. This is a traveling physician I just hired. He's from the countryside. Please excuse him. A physician? Yes. That's great. I've been suffering from backache for days. Let him go home with me to give me some treatment. - Mr. Yuan! - Piss off! Who are you? Just exercise to cure your backache. You have a death wish. Do you know who I am? I know that you have a bad back indeed. But you must feel better now. Just wait. - Bravo! - Great! - Nice! - Splendid! After you. My master told me to give you this letter in person. - Take a seat. - All right. Jinsun, I hope this letter finds you well. I'm on the trip all the time in the region of Guangdong and Guangxi. I suddenly heard an order from that madam to assassinate us in our journey. But hostile forces are still present. I don't dare to stay put for fear of danger. That madam is usurping power. She tries to please other nations while putting 400 million citizens in agony. At this time of internal and external troubles, we can't hide and live in peace alone. We should assist the monarch and save the citizens from grave peril. I hear that you often give treatments and medicines to save citizens from illness. Your nationalistic spirit is far better than the kind Duke of Donggao. So I wrote to ask you to help me enter Beijing to gather patriots of the same mind and carry out reforms to realize political integrity. I'm willing to sacrifice myself and not fear death in going to Beijing. Sincerely yours, Fusheng. Judging from what happened today, Tianjin is also being watched closely. My master is really struggling. But you don't have to worry too much. Tianjin is different from other places with the many schools of martial arts and righteous men. That gentleman who helped us on the dock today is an example. I shall do my very best to complete your master's request. Mr. Huo, thank you for your help earlier today. Here. - Here's a toast to you. - All right. - Here. - Drink up. Good wine. Sorry to keep you waiting, sirs. Sweet and Sour Carp. Enjoy. We're in a period of political turmoil. Mr. Huo, why don't you serve the country? You'll surely make a difference with your extraordinary skills. State affairs are beyond a martial artist like me. I'll be glad enough if I can get a toehold in Tianjin with my skill. I beg to differ. Strong citizens are the foundation of a nation's peace. Enemies are threatening our nation. Citizens must strengthen themselves. If every citizen is as strong as you, our nation will be revitalized. There will be hope for our citizens. You have a point. But someone must be willing to teach them if they want to practice martial arts. Master Huo, you can teach us. Think about it. With your martial arts skills, if you open a school and accept students, you'll be known throughout Tianjin. Open a school and accept students? It's just that Huo's Fist can't be taught to outsiders. We open martial arts schools to invigorate the people and strengthen their bodies and souls and promote Chinese traditional martial arts. Indeed, old feudal traditions are deep-rooted, like how our nation isolates itself from the outside world. It's hard to change. All right. Let's drop this matter. Come on, let's drink. Take him back. It's not a big deal. If my father won't teach them, I'll do it. As long as someone wants to learn it, forget about not teaching outsiders. Let's open the largest martial arts school in Tianjin. I'll teach whoever comes. That would be great. Master Huo, can I be your first student? Sure. Master. Mr. Huo. If you want to open a school, you can count on me to choose a venue and purchase it. However, there are many rules in Tianjin even though it's a small place. What rules? If you want to open a martial arts school in Tianjin, you must fight with the representatives of seven other schools. If you win, you can open one of your own. Fighting? That's right up my alley. Open it and let me see. Is it him? Yes. Keep an eye on Huaiqing Pharmacy. I told you that I'll only donate money, but not get involved directly. But you had to use my boat. Now, this is great. He had his head cut off in your pharmacy. And the Yu family is involved in trouble. I'm just a businessman. I don't want to get involved with national affairs nor am I capable of that. I am telling you, Nong Jinsun. If anything happens to my daughter, I will hunt you down even in the netherworld! I will leave Tianjin with Jianjia as soon as possible. You're on your own now. Deming! I don't want to tell you that every man is responsible for the fate of his nation. However, when a bird's nest is overturned, no egg can remain intact. The dock is not safe anymore. I want to ask you to help me one last time. Let me transfer my goods with your fishing boat. Sir, we don't accept students anymore. Try your luck elsewhere. I'm here to challenge your school. Master. You don't have a visiting letter or a letter of reference. You're not a local, right? That's too troublesome. Let's just fight. You are here to cause trouble, aren't you? Whoever visits us is our guest. Go and fight with him. Know your limits. Don't disable him. Yes, Master. You didn't learn martial arts right, and you're so snobbish. I'm giving you a lesson with that kick. Is there anyone else who can fight in Shengwu School? - Say that again! - How dare you! Yes. You're breaking the martial arts circle's rules in Tianjin. It's good for those pedantic and annoying rules to be broken. Young man, don't speak so arrogantly. It depends on how good you really are. Sit tight. - Master! - Master! Master, are you all right? - Master! - Master! My name is Huo Yuanjia. I want to open the largest martial arts school in Tianjin. I will accept anyone who wants to learn. Everyone is welcome to go and have a duel with me. Jinsun. Jinsun! Jinsun, he won! He won, Jinsun! My master won! Jinsun, I wish you were there. With a few punches and kicks, my master destroyed that school owner's chair. It seems like you won your first battle. Congratulations, Yuanjia. This is just the beginning. You're such a good martial artist. If the result of that duel spreads out, your name will be well known. I'm afraid that there will be no place in Tianjin for Shengwu School. But there's nothing they can do about it. There is no place for a martial artist who can't defend himself. Sir, how may I help you? Mr. Nong, right? My master is experiencing heart problems. We heard that Huaiqing Pharmacy hired an experienced physician. We want to invite him for a consultation. I'm sorry. That countryside physician travels around to heal people. He already left. All right. But I was wondering when your next physician will arrive. As the saying goes, "Find the root of your troubles to set your heart at ease." Even if I get a physician for your master, he might not be able to provide a prescription for him. In my opinion, it's better for your master to relax and to live and let live. This way, his heart illness will heal on its own. My master said that at the early stage of heart illness, just find the right physician, and he'll be healed. So Mr. Nong, please give way. My master is generous to those who are willing to cooperate. I'm really sorry. It seems like I can't help you. Damn it! Do it while we're still asking nicely! Since the physician is away, we'll come back another day. Yuanjia, did you provide a visiting letter at the martial arts school? We would end up fighting anyway. Why bother with the pointless formality? It was that guy, Huo, who got in our way on the dock that day. Should we... No rush. He's a good martial artist. If such a talent could work for us, the Qing Empire would be very lucky. Yes. Master. This is Huo's Fist, right? Who said that Huo's Fist is the only form I know? You're so amazing. When can I be as good as you? With good kung fu skills, not only can I help the weak, but I also can protect Xiaoyi. Who is Xiaoyi? Xiaoyi. What are you doing here? Is Mr. Nong home? He just came back. Please come in. She's so pretty. Indeed, she is. They're both pretty. So your itinerary has been set? Yes. My father seems to be in a hurry saying that we must leave the day after tomorrow. Help me tell Deming that what he is doing now will surely be meaningful. Sure. Take care. Liu Sheng. - See Ms. Yu out. - All right. This way, please. Mr. Huo, these are some snacks my lady made to thank you for your help at the dock last time. Master said that we're moving to Shanghai, and we'll never return to Tianjin. You'll never return? Take good care of yourself. Hey! How can she just leave like that? I have a gift that I haven't given her yet. Then what are you waiting for? You're a big girl now. Don't cry. My lady, why must we go to Shanghai? Tianjin is such a nice place. I don't think it's Tianjin that's nice. Liu Sheng's nice, right? I don't like that chubby guy. You don't like him? I was thinking just now that I should tell Father to let you get married. It seems like I was overthinking. My lady! Look at you. You two obviously like each other. Why can't you have a good chat when you meet? He is so dense. He never took the initiative. Master. Master. Come up. Master. Master. Let's just forget it and go home. Cut the crap. Master. Can you give it to her for me? Thank you, Master. Come up. Hurry up. How can you let your master do that for you? You are my master. Why can't you do it for me? - You... - Mr. Huo? Mr. Huo! Are you here to give a gift to my lady? Yes. No. Mr. Huo. Are you all right? I'm fine. It seems like Mr. Huo isn't dense. He even gave you a gift in return. He denied it. So you don't like it? Then I'll throw it away. What if you break it? Give it to me. I'll find a chance to give it back. My lady, you're smart. Now, you have an excuse to see him again. You brat. It took me a long time to pick that gift for Xiaoyi. ASPIRE FOR VIRTUE AND RIGHTEOUSNESS IN MARTIAL ARTS Everyone. There is a big event for Tianjin's martial arts circle today. Tianjin's seven martial arts schools' alliance former chairman of Shunyuan School, Master Wang Wu, is announcing his retirement from the school and martial arts circle starting today. He'll never get involved in the circle's affairs anymore. Martial artists like us fight and compete against each other all our lives. There are so many feuds and grievances among us. But thanks to your support, over the years I've gained a lot of privileges and respect from you. I will retire starting today to make way for the younger generation. I hope the up-and-coming generation can go more steadily and on a wider path than old men like us. Wash your hands in a golden basin to purge your sins. From now on, all old scores have been settled. This is the end of the ritual! Congratulations, Master Wang. - Congratulations, Master Wang. - Congratulations, Master Wang. General Yuan has arrived! Congratulations, Wang Wu. You're retiring at the height of your career. Your integrity in your later years will be protected. My master has already retired. Please pay attention to your words. General Yuan. To what do I owe the pleasure of your visit? Originally, I thought that the famous Tianjin martial arts circle had a lot of experts. I didn't expect them to be just a group of incompetent mediocrities. - What? - What did you say? General Yuan. What is that supposed to mean? It seems like you really don't know what's happening out there. I heard that the Nong family hired a martial artist named Huo Yuanjia who claims that he'll defeat all martial arts schools, and he'll open Tianjin's largest martial arts school. He's an outsider who meddles with local rules. Youlan, is that true? Yes, Master. They say that the head of Shengwu School is still recuperating at home. - Is that true? - What? General Yuan, thank you for letting me know. I will handle this matter properly. Don't mention it. You and I go way back after all. I should inform you. Or people might laugh at the lack of talent in Tianjin's martial arts circle in the future. Youlan. I have already retired. So I will let you handle this matter. But remember, you can't break the rules of our circle. Yes, Master. A liability waiver? Yuanjia. For the duel, you usually need to inform them and give them a visiting letter. Then their senior disciple will fight with you until a winner is determined. Regardless of victory or defeat, both parties will remain dignified. It turns out that the rules are used to be their fig leaf. Since they're afraid of being beaten up, why not run a real school, and just reason with people? Tianjin is not just any normal city. If you break the rules, you're offending the entire Tianjin martial arts circle. They will use the rules to sanction you. It's no longer an ordinary duel to open a martial arts school anymore. Once you lose, you'll never be a member of the Tianjin martial arts circle. Do you understand? I do. Jinsun. Can you lend me some decent clothes? What for? Since I'll become a sensation overnight, I want to change into some new clothes to celebrate in advance. QIWU HALL QIWU HALL LIABILITY WAIVER SIGNED BY HUO YUANJIA Since you have signed the waiver, you're challenging us at your own risk. Master Huo. This way, please. The shorter the weapon, the riskier it is to use it. The longer the weapon, the stronger it is. Get drunk with good wine DRUNKEN FAIRY PAVILION Swords and heroes What is the world of martial arts like? This is interesting. Lift your arms without mercy In a fight, there's no retreat Pretend like no one's around Pretend like someone's around Harmony is treasured Righteousness comes first Defeat the strong with skills Yet you must train like the strong Huo Yuanjia You send a woman to fight against me? Is there no man in Tianjin's martial arts circle anymore? - Watch your attitude! - Mind your words! - Watch it! - Mind your words! - How dare you? - I heard that there's a good practitioner named Wang Wu the Blade Warrior. Tell him to come. My master has already retired. He won't get involved in the circle anymore. Today, I'll fight against you on his behalf. Whether he is retired or not is none of my business. I only acknowledge Wang Wu as my opponent. I won't fight against a woman. You want to see my master? Defeat me first. MARTIAL ARTS Master Huo. - Youlan! - Youlan! - That was impressive. - Youlan! - And it's ruthless enough. - Youlan! I admire you. Youlan is dead. Kill him to get revenge for her! As I said, Tianjin's martial arts circle is a motley crowd. They signed a liability waiver. Now, you can't afford to lose? What's the matter? You want to kill him? Wait. He is right. Since she signed a waiver, we should follow our rules. Master Huo. You can open a martial arts school. However, good virtue lasts forever. Whether it can last or not depends on you. See him out. Mr. Huo. I want to have a cup of tea with you. What do you think? Just tell me what you want to say. You're quite straightforward. I'll cut to the chase then. With your skills, I will make sure you have a bright future if you serve the imperial court. I'm not interested. You will be interested. Liu Sheng. What happened? Where's Mr. Nong? Master, untie me first. Yuan and his thugs came and took my cousin with them. They said that we must give them Mr. Tan in exchange. Who is Mr. Tan? I'll get the letter for you, Master. Master. My cousin told me to give you this letter if anything happens to him. He said you'd understand after reading it. TO MR. NONG JINSUN Who else knows about this? This is bad. Master, I'll be damned. Hurry up. It's open. YU RESIDENCE Master. Master. There is no one in the house. Have they already moved to Shanghai? I think so. They moved. That's great. I feel relieved then. He's dead. Dump his body. Yes, sir. Did you tie all the loose ends? Yes. Then... What about those two girls? They're yours now. Thank you, General Yuan. You wouldn't accept hard or soft tactics. That's why I can only invite you over for a cup of tea. Mr. Yu loves his daughter dearly indeed. However, people with an obvious weakness like his often can't keep a secret. If you hand him over to me, I'll strongly recommend you in front of Her Majesty. Even if you don't love fame or fortune, I think your father will be happy to accept them. Your offer sounds really tempting indeed. However, is it really that interesting to be a slave in such a decadent imperial court, General Yuan? What a presumptuous statement. The Qing Empire has well-equipped and well-trained troops. Many nations have come to pay tribute. How can it be decadent? Well-equipped and well-trained? Foreign enemies are already at our doorstep. Haven't you signed enough treaties surrendering our sovereign rights under humiliating terms? Don't tell me you'll only realize that the imperial court is a lost cause when you cede the capital too. How presumptuous! To defend against foreign enemies, we need to solve internal troubles first. You rebellious traitors are the reason why the Qing Empire is in deep trouble. The Qing Empire is like a house on the verge of collapse. Its whole structure is completely rotten. You think you can stop it from collapsing with a few small pillars to support the outer walls diagonally? This is ridiculous. Even if I have to lock down the whole Tianjin, I will find him tomorrow. I will let him see with his own eyes what difference you intellectuals can make, who can only talk the talk. Master. What are you thinking about? In terms of national affairs and family affairs, which one comes first, and which one comes second? I only know that it's harder for citizens to survive if the imperial court won't consider their interests. Master. There's a letter for you. YUANJIA, YOUR FATHER IS IN CRITICAL CONDITION. COME HOME IF YOU WANT TO SEE HIM. My dear, you might catch a cold. Go back inside. Is Yuanjia back yet? He will soon. He'll arrive soon. - I'll wait for him here. - All right. Stay close. It's coming. Master, the boat is here. Master. It's Wang Wu the Blade Warrior. Are you Huo Yuanjia? Master Wang. I didn't kill your disciple. But if you must get an explanation, I will go find you and settle it another day. However, I can't do it today. - I don't have money. - Please be kind. - Scram! - Please be kind. - Give me the child! Cut the crap! - I'm begging you! - Give him to me! Let go! - Don't take my child! Liu Sheng. Liu Sheng! Folks, stop. Jinsun! I am glad you're fine. Where's Mr. Tan? - On the rickshaw. - Good. Where's Yuanjia? Huo Yuanjia. We meet again. Cut the crap. Where is he? Stop pretending. I know that you won't really bring him to me. I've personally sent someone to invite him. Which brave martial artist is in the rickshaw? Come out. Mr. Wang? Now I believe that Youlan's death has nothing to do with you. Then why did you come here today? Although martial artists should not act impulsively, we need to be responsible. Even a weak intellectual like Mr. Tan dares to stand out and speak for the citizens. How can I, a martial artist, be afraid to die just because of my reputation? Since he's going to Beijing via Tianjin, I will make sure he leaves here safely. This way, please. All right. Mr. Tan, no matter what happens in a while, don't get out of the rickshaw. Didn't you already retire? Why are you getting involved in this trouble? Every man is responsible for the fate of his nation. You're a dignified general, yet you're behaving this way. Aren't you like a vile villain too? What a joke. I'm loyal to the imperial court in suppressing rebels. How am I a villain? Since you broke the rules first, don't blame me for not considering our friendship. Kill them. Jinsun! Let's go! Hurry up! Run! Kill all of them! Come on! Hurry up. Run! Go. Mind the archers overhead! Come on! Take this! Out of the way! Yuanjia, protect Mr. Tan. Mr. Wang! Huo Yuanjia. Don't you want to be the best martial artist in Tianjin? Go! Just go! Come on! Kill them. A bunch of rebels and traitors dare to go against the imperial court? You have a death wish. Liu Sheng! Liu Sheng! It's all right, Master. I'm going to see Xiaoyi soon. Liu Sheng. Liu Sheng! You're so stubborn. Mr. Tan. I understand your enthusiasm for reforms. But your visit to Beijing this time will only end in death. The Qing Empire is unsalvageable. Are you not afraid of dying in vain? The great powers all say that China is weak. They're right. 400 million compatriots are starving, cold, poor, and lowly. The officials are utterly corrupt. Where's the future of China? Someone has to stand up and do something. Since ancient times, reforms have always come with bloodshed. If I fail, I'll die. If I succeed, I know I'll also die. The purpose of my trip is just for a gleam of light. I understand now. However, when our nation rises someday and our citizens live a peaceful life, Jinsun, don't forget to light me an incense stick and tell me about it. One who does something he knows impossible to succeed is a saint. Yuanjia. What are you thinking about? My father once said that good virtue is the foundation of martial arts. Martial artists should convince people with good virtue. I didn't understand what he meant until I saw how Mr. Wang Wu let go of our private grievances for the greater good and even died for it. I think his good virtue was the real reason why he was respected by people. It's a pity he led such a heroic life, yet he died tragically in this troubled time. Jinsun. What happens after a hero dies? A hero's origin doesn't matter. But they must have a worthy death. How dare a boor like you get involved in national affairs? Can you afford to do this? Can you bear the consequences? So what if Tan Sitong makes it to the capital? Since ancient times, intellectuals have hindered the nation. I will kill you first before I kill him so that he can tell you in person what "intellectuals are useless" means. Young Master Yuanjia. Young Master Yuanjia is back. Young Master Yuanjia is back! PAY RESPECT HUO ENDI'S MEMORIAL TABLET He always wanted to see you. But he couldn't wait until you're back. Here. TO YUANJIA Yuanjia. I should be dead already when you see this letter. The only one I'm worried about is you. HUO ENDI'S MEMORIAL TABLET Even though the Huo family is considered a famous martial arts family, Huo's Fist wasn't really handed down in our family. MIZONG FIST When I was younger, I didn't master the 64-style Fist well. I was good at attacking, but I couldn't stop when I should. Before I realized it, I had already caused a lot of trouble. As they say, you'll harm others and yourself if you learn martial arts without good virtue. You should value your integrity and virtue more than winning a fight. That's why good virtue is the foundation of martial arts. Bear that in mind. I know that you're extremely talented in martial arts. I hope you can use Huo's Fist for the right purpose and become a master of your generation. I hope you won't disgrace the Huo family's reputation. Father. HUO ENDI'S MEMORIAL TABLET Extra, extra! Japanese samurai Miyamoto Jiro gives an open challenge to fight martial artists nationwide to the death. If no one comes forward in a month, China's martial artists must submit to Japan. He challenged nine martial arts schools in Shanghai and is undefeated so far. Miyamoto is a martial arts maniac. His laijutsu is not an ordinary Japanese sword technique. And Miyamoto is more than a martial arts maniac. He's a well-known Budo master in Japan Yuanjia. We can't take Miyamoto lightly. The situation is chaotic now. It is very likely that he's backed by Japan's military. Jinsun. Are you afraid that I'll take his challenge? I know you. As a martial artist, you can't just sit and watch when you see such an insult. But our priority now is to promote China's martial arts to 400 million citizens. You're the chief coach of Chin Woo Athletic Association. If you fight against him, what if... As an old adage goes, the nail that sticks out gets hammered down. It's not that I'm trying to stop you. But there are things that one must do, and things that one must not do. CHANGSHENG SMOKE PARLOR SCIENTIFIC DESIGN AND BRIGHT COLORS Yo, don't laugh The ring is no place to joke around Don't make a scene and stop jumping My last advice for you Rely on me, I'll cover you Your fists are nothing Huo's Fist is the best Laugh?
