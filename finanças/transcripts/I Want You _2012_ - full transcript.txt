I welcome you ... to my private beach. To which only a small number of privileged people, will have access. Where we can enjoy the exquisite musical taste of our king of the kiosk. Gin, you did it? Yes. Well, it needs some retouch. But I think it's time to share it with someone. And it is a crime to come to this beach and not have a good swim! Luque, Luque... I do not know ... It's always difficult to explain everything that has happened. Pollo was my best friend.. He was my brother. He spent all his life to put that bike in place, and doing races. And well, he and Katina ... Katina also knew him. The last words he said to me: were "Our girls are amazing, we have to live up to them." If you think about it, it's the perfect phrase to say, before you leave for good. Yes... he succeeded. The fact is that I have 1,000 things to tell him ... 1.000 no, 10.000! - For it is a wonder the fire! - How? Yes, when ... When someone disappears from your life ... and you may not see them ever again ', or if you can not tell them all the things you want, you can... Get ... Get a paper and pencil, and write a letter. That ... can be eternal, or just a word. If you write to that person that is gone but can not send it, - "I have loved you." - Then, take the letter... and put it closer to the flame, burn it . If the wind carries the ashes away, with it goes the pain inside. - Katina, get off! - Katina! - get off, this is not funny! - get off, Katina! - Katina... - Give me the candle ... Give me your hand! Goodbye ... Come on, come on, quick! From the beginning! Come on! In an hour's start! Katina. Hey! Quiet, don't you understand! Tell me whats the matter. Hugo? Listen, there's a problem.

It's raining outside? I went swimming in the sea. What luck! Yes. Mom ... Mom, please ... Mom, please. Mom ... Everything passes away, son. Mom, please. Mom ... Mom, please ... Dear Gin ... Tonic, Its time to write to you, what I was never able to tell you. Although it is late. to write what happened, in a letter that I'll not send, and that you will never receive. Which, you taught me, as soon as I finished to write, burn it. - Its good! - My feelings will burn, and so the pain ... How was it?? - The way you said it? Ah, yes, "So the pain will not stay inside." - This time I want to be clear. - Are you ready? - Its over, Claudio. I'd be a fool, if you did not shout out that I'm wrong, with you, that I have ruined everything, - From the beginning. - "Acca sleeping" I tried to advance, without first putting aside the things that prevented me. the narrow view of the past, looking back. Wanting to forget, but continuing to remember. Its madness, Gin. - Still on my mind. - Daniela Alcazar? Yes, lets go. No, Mom. No. Halfway between one and the other party. Without forgeting, Without forgiveness, Without advance. What is, the secret of the future, Gin? It could be to look for the good, that's advancing, "My brother drunk at the carnival in Notting Hill " - "(Acca background)" - To look more closely. More. So close, that things become blurred sharp, become clear. Clear! There are things that have happened before, long before. I will not expect miracles, just that things happen, or not? Yes? No? Yes, no, Yes, no... Now for me it would be clear. But now it no longer depends on me. But you. I love you. Can you help me fix this disaster. Maybe if we try, we could go back in place. It depends on us. Both of us. Of course it will not be easy. It seems that it will work. Nothing is impossible, Hugo. [deba/dtxua303/detoxua303] Hey!
