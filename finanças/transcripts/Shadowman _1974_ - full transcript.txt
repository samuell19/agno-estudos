Reading my post, Albert? Forgive me, sir. I couldn't help it Terrible business, that man who steals brains Yes. Leave me now, Albert If you don't mind, I would like leave to go to the dentist this morning I was in agony all night Off you go, Albert What can I do for you? I'm here on behalf of Mr Nodo Nodo warned me You're late Go on through to the back So you tried to extort 5,000 francs out of Mr Nodo... ...but he refused because you couldn't give him a satisfactory guarantee He's a real shark, a filthy usurer. The interest he was asking for... So what do you want from me? Well, Mr Nodo told me that if I had any interesting information... ...you might buy it off me What sort of information do you have to sell me? My master owns certain documents concerning some treasure I tried to open the drawer this morning but he turned up What is this treasure? The treasure of the Knight Templars That old ruse. Sit down I'm listening It's like this. Ever since I began working for him... ... he's immersed himself in the history of the Templars He's published books on the subject but I am sure... And don't forget, from now on... ...you must do as you are told, without asking any questions We will check out your story and if we think it's worth it... ...you will get your money Come So, Doctor, what progress? My expectations have been exceeded There is no catalepsy or catatonia The patients' brains are totally inactive... ...something we have never achieved before Look, the EEG is completely flat... ...as it is with corpses It is as if they were dead... ...except for the heartbeat, which is naturally fainter... ...and which is transcribed here The subjects are totally inert They are beyond hypnosis even I still haven't managed... I'm not your patron, Doctor, as you well know I didn't snatch you from the hands of the police to suffer a psychology lesson You promised me killers who would obey me blindly You'll have your killers And will they carry out all my orders, without exception? Without exception I hope, for your sake, that you are not mistaken The file on the treasure of the Templars Coming right up Do you have a file on this Maxime de Borrego? Yes, he's a specialist on the Templars and a historian of some repute... ...but he doesn't appear to believe in the treasure We will check it out Who are you? I have been told that you hold the secret of the treasure of the Templars I have come to confirm that information My dear sir, judging from your strange get-up... ...I am in the presence of a hoaxer or a mental patient Either way, your conversation is of no interest to me Be so good as to leave If you really hold this secret... ...I would be happy to share it with you I don't know how you managed to get in but your exit is there Leave immediately. Leave or I will call for help I wouldn't do anything if I were you Anyway, your butler is in his room. He won't hear you So, this treasure... I assure you, there is no such thing as the treasure of the Templars It's a myth This is your nephew, Paul de Borrego, the sailor, isn't it? You see? I know everything Except for one thing Where is the treasure of the Templars? Don't take me for a fool. I have done some research, too I am convinced the treasure exists and I want to know where it is... ...so you're going to tell me all you know You will never find out But I will. I will You will talk Leave this house quickly You have just enough time before... You have no idea of the terrible acts of revenge that would ensue... ...if you were to succeed in dragging this secret out of me The ciborium in the display cabinet... ...is made of solid gold with genuine rubies I assure you, it's worth a fortune It's yours. Now go I swear, I won't say a word to the police I'll take the ciborium since you're offering it to me... ...but I will not leave I have decided that you will talk My decisions are always irrevocable You're a madman Are you ready? Lord... ...give me the strength, I beg you, to say nothing I live here In that case, go and see my colleague back there Excuse me, Inspector. There's a man who wants to come in - He says he lives here - Show him in God, Mr Paul, there's been a terrible tragedy - Who are you, sir? - It's Mr Paul This poor man's nephew That's correct I am Superintendent Sorbier from the Criminal Investigation Department Superintendent I understand you are a sailor I am a solo navigator and submarine archaeologist Your uncle was murdered last night I know. I have just been informed You don't seem too upset My personal feelings are my business, Superintendent Incorrect Under such circumstances, everything is police business Especially the question of who will inherit, for example I will, obviously I have a number of questions to ask you - Please accompany me to my office - Gladly - You, too. Follow me - Very well, Superintendent Come along The time has come for you to make your decision, Brother Amory I accept. I will take the place of our murdered brother... ...and I won't rest until the murder of Maxime de Borrego has been avenged Stand up, Brother Amory Seneschal of the Order of the Templars... ...accept the tributes from your Brothers Send me your report as soon as possible. There's a man here... ...who wants to talk to you urgently about the Borrego case - Show him in - Right away, boss Sit down. I'm listening Superintendent, I have just got off a plane at Orly from Spain It wasn't until I left the airport that I was able to buy a paper imagine my surprise when I came across this article I knew nothing of the murder I am Paul de Borrego You are dealing with an impostor That butler really conned me. I walked right into the trap Accessory to murder. He'll pay for that I have a key to the house Go to your room. Stay there, Leblanc Welcome, Superintendent. Whisky? There are a few details I would like you to clarify I've had a few minor problems I'm at 38, Rue Lasalle at the crossroads... ...at the building site Come in, Mrs Albert Say, Mrs Martin, there's something going on in that house There are broken windows and I can hear moaning At the crime scene? Martin, perhaps you could go and have a look No doubt about it, we'd better call the police BORREGO CASE: RITUAL KILLING? IS THE BOGUS PAUL DE BORREGO THE KILLER? "Is the bogus Paul de Borrego the killer? "Was Maxime de Borrego the victim of a ritual killing?" Tell me, Mr de Borrego... "For over 600 years... "...the Templars have been avenging the murder of their master... "...who was burnt at the stake on 19th March 1314 "Borrego: Victim of Baphomet, the idol of the Templars?" Another question mark "Knights of the Templars practise black magic: Terrible story of witchcraft" No question mark That journalist seems sure of his story So? Journalists have been gleaning titbits on this question... ...for over six centuries All these stories on the treasure of the Knight Templars prove that it exists Any serious historian will tell you it's a myth... ...born of the fact that individually the Knights pledged poverty... ...whereas the Order was hugely rich Perhaps the murderer hadn't read what the reliable historians had to say But one thing is certain Your uncle was tortured... ...to make him say something But what? I haven't the faintest idea Here's your man, sir We were just talking about the treasure of the Templars So, my dear Albert, be so kind as to shed some light on the subject... ...will you? I don't know anything about all that, Superintendent I won't answer your questions until my lawyer is present Go ahead, Doctor Look, it's him That's your man The murderer didn't even need to force the lock You opened the door to him, didn't you? Even if you're not the killer... ...you must be his accomplice How many men did you open the door to on the night of the crime? Listen to me, Albert... ...I'm sure you didn't want my uncle to die But the man or men who tortured him to death are free... ...and they could commit other atrocities If you hide the truth, you will be responsible for those crimes Mr Paul, if only you knew That's all we were asking for I won't speak unless my lawyer is present He wanted to kill you, too, yesterday Why are you protecting him? Too bad You'll go before a judge if that's what you want But believe me, you will regret not having spoken, with or without a lawyer Give me that Here, sign here Lock him up That's it, then What's going on? They shot him What's wrong with them? Go back into your office and call an ambulance Tell us the name of the man who wanted you dead I don't know But you've seen his face, his real face? He doesn't have a face Poor Maxime He led such a peaceful, secluded life He never hurt anyone To be finished off in that way... I can't believe it Whoever did this is a maniac No, Professor. The police no longer believe it was the crime of a maniac Your uncle always refused to talk about the treasure in his works I myself have never really known his real thoughts on the matter Our research related to a different aspect of the history of the Temple Precisely. I am unable to tell the police... ...whether the documents were stolen from Maxime's archives Perhaps you could help me, seeing as you worked with my uncle Of course. I'll have to think about it I'll come to Paris as soon as possible I have delved into your uncle's library so many times, I know it by heart But in a crypt here in London I have found some amazing inscribed stones... ...and I must record them Think of your old friend, too In his collection there are some coins that might be of interest to you I could give you those coins... ...to keep as a souvenir NEXT DAY IN PARIS I've got him. In a few minutes, we're going to have a chat - I think we're being followed - What? The white Simca behind us Get closer I recognise him. He's one of the policemen at Borrego's house We must shake them off I didn't think the nephew was being watched My informants have let me down. Those responsible will be killed We've been spotted. Don't let them catch us Why chase him? He was in Spain at the time of the murder Borrego's Spanish alibi hasn't been confirmed And all these stories about the Templars... ...the crimes... ...and what's more, a real and a bogus Borrego... ...it's so confused that Sorbier suspects everyone I order you to stop. Are you mad? Stop. What's got into you? Are you mad? Stop. We're going to have to turn back, sir. The car is too far away At this speed, in three minutes it will be out of our control I'll let Borrego go. We can always find another opportunity to get him I'll destroy the taxi Martine Leduc, friend of Paul de Borrego Lives at 15, Rue de Bon Secours Borrego confides in her - Does she go out? - Yes Every day between 3:00 and 5:00 Interesting MARTINE LEDUC EMBROIDERER Just in time. I think I just passed her on the stairs Yes, I just heard her coming back - Perfect timing - She usually comes back later Here he comes I'm so happy you're here. You're always away Darling Martine, you shouldn't worry so much I travel but I always come back Come in quickly In the end I was ejected onto the roadside The police car was found in a field... ... and the false taxi exploded This story is unbelievable Are you still in touch with that poet detective? - What's his name? - Séraphin Beauminon Can you ask him to come round as soon as possible? Hello. I would like to speak to Mr Beauminon, please Hello, Séraphi Alright, I'll wait They're just going to get him Here are fruits, flowers Leaves and twigs - And here is my heart - Keep your heart, Séraphin - Paul de Borrego - Hello, how do you do? - Let me take those - No, my darling Martine I can manage - They need water - You're too kind. You shouldn't have Of course The idiot. He's filling the vase I hid the microphone in with water There's only one microphone left Do you know Paul de Borrego? Of course I do Everybody knows Paul de Borrego these days Mr de Borrego, may I offer you my condolences? Let's not stand on ceremony, Mr Beauminon Please call me Séraphin. Everyone does Very well. In that case, call me Paul Séraphin... ...it was me who asked Martine to call you I'm going to tell you a secret... ... a secret of the utmost importance that I didn't want to reveal to the police You have my undivided attention May I? That's better What's happening? Well? The second microphone has been covered as well Do you know what some historians think? That two or three centuries before Christopher Columbus... ... the French Templars went to America and brought back a cargo of gold The idea was to build up a war chest... ... with a view to financing a crusade... ... which would put the holy places in the possession of Christianity for ever This silence... it's infuriating. The research project I have just completed... ...was entirely financed by my Uncle Maxime One evening he called me into his study... ...and asked me, as if simply requesting a box of matches... ...to go and search the shallow seas of the Caribbean... ... at a latitude of approximately 18 degrees 43 north... ... and a longitude of 88 degrees 52 west Rather surprised, I asked him what I'd be looking for He replied that he had good reason to think... ... that a Templar ship carrying gold was shipwrecked at that location... ... between 14th and 19th January 1297 The ship was called the Sancta Maria He wouldn't hear of any obstacles When I explained my reservations, he replied... Paul, I'm asking you. If you feel any affection for your uncle... ...I beg you not to ask any more questions Do as I say without arguing I'll do it And? The shallows exist... ...almost exactly where he said they would There is a platform about 10m below sea level It was a chance in a million, but I found the wreck... ... what was left of the lost ship I searched it and I retrieved... ...this But it's gold It's gold Yes, but much more solid than ordinary gold One side bears the motto of the Order of the Templars... ...and the other the name of the ship... ...Sancta Maria Martine, can I entrust this key to you? Of course I'm going to need your help to carry out this enquiry, Séraphin And also as my bodyguard, I'm afraid - Will you do it? - When do we start? As soon as possible We'll start by sorting out my uncle's library Then we'll check if anything other than the ciborium was stolen At your service He would never forgive me but we'll have to delve into his past As far as I know, Uncle Maxime didn't have a love life to speak of... ...but his research life was very full It 'll be difficult to penetrate Yet I think it's the only way to shed any light on this mystery surrounding us... ...to uncover the motive for this crime and perhaps... What is it, Séraphin? What's happening now? I had no idea that someone had been in here. It's unbelievable There's no mistaking it. They're after you, hot on your heels You can say that again It's one of two things. Either those who are spying on me heard everything... ...in which case we should tell the police everything right away... ...or Séraphin's jacket muffled our voices and they know nothing - It's a chance to set them a trap - What sort of trap? It's a toss-up, but we'll need the help of the police Explain what you mean Paul, they tortured your uncle in order to extract a secret from him That's also why they tried to kidnap you What would our unknown enemies do... ...if they found out that Martine knew the whole story? They'd try to kidnap her, too, wouldn't they? With this microphone we can convey false information to them... ...and get the kidnapping to happen at a time and place of our choice With all the work I have on, I simply can't lave Paris But your life is at stake. They killed Uncle Maxime because of this treasure They obviously wanted to kidnap me to try and get me to talk I don't want you taking any risks But no one knows that I know the secret of the Templars' treasure This Martine Leduc... ...I need her Everything's ready Over to you We're on our way Come on, let's go Where do you think you're going with that? Hands up. Quick, open the door. Give me the key. Quickly Quick, the key. I must open this door No, I don't have it Get a move on, you idiot - Well? - Up there Quickly. Get me a ladder, a step-ladder Get this out of me. Pull it out. Careful. Get down. He's dangerous - What sort of weapon has he got? - An airgun Or some blade What's that? Don't be afraid. It's the police. Has someone been in here? Yes, a man in black. He left through that door Come on, let's hurry It's her, governor It's her. Get ready to make your move The police are blocking my retreat I'm coming down through the studio Right Over here. Over here. I've got her Give her to me, Séraphin I don't know what's wrong with me. I feel so sleepy What's this? A blowpipe? The game's up, sweetheart Sorry, Superintendent Keep your stupid ideas to yourself, Mr Beauminon Don't involve me next time Poor old Séraphin Alas, your ideas aren't always good ones Wait, Superintendent Setting a trap wasn't such a bad idea after all See? - Not you as well, Mr de Borrego? - Just hear me out What if I were to organise an auction for everything here at Hôtel Drouot? - But you told me... - What if we spread the word... ...that certain lots contain the secret of the treasure of the Templars? If that is really what our murderer is looking for... ...I think he will buy it at any price His remote-controlled taxi is proof that he has vast wealth at his disposal I'm convinced he will reveal himself, one way or another The problem with all that is that the murderer... ...knows your uncle's library as well as you do... ...and didn't find anything of interest there But we might have documents he doesn't know about We might have found them hidden somewhere secret And where will you really find them? I have no idea. We could forge them ourselves And you think he'll fall for it? Yes, if they're authenticated by a specialist But I absolutely can't stoop to such methods My professional honour is at stake Not at all. Think of the fame Once the murderer has been arrested, the press will talk only of your courage What wonderful publicity for you. Your books will sell by the thousands And no one will question your opinion. You're the only person who can help us You can authenticate our forgeries Authenticate them, yes After all, why not? We might as well try our luck Considering where we're at, why not? Why not indeed? Miss, do you really think you need me? You're indispensable, Professor Let's give it a go, then The television programme The news today is brought to you from the Hôtel Drouot This is Professor Petrie, English historian of repute... ... member of London's Royal Academy... ... who has agreed to evaluate the objects... ... which will go on Sal tomorrow and can be viewed by the public... ... at Hôtel Drouot from 2:00 this afternoon Which do you think is the rarest and most interesting object in this auction? There isn't just one object but three... ... which together make up one single lot I say three: Three medallions... ... three wax seals We found them in an old shoebox in a cupboard By chance, they had escaped the notice of the murderer Evidently Maxime de Borrego hid them there I remember him showing them to me He believed that these three medallions represent... ... in a symbolic form, naturally, the key to the secret of this famous treasure I personally do not believe that the treasure exists... ... but there is no denying that these medallions are most curious... ... and seem to contain a sort of message Look at this one, for example We have a horseman His lance in itself definitely implies a certain direction And it goes without saying that the medallions are authentic? I need those seals - It's a trap. Be careful - A trap? There must be some rat skilful enough to take the bait without getting caught All the subjects you have entrusted to me have been operated on Yes, and as you can see, we are feeding them through a drip It is essential to wake them up from time to time to give them solid food... ...and at the same time make them take exercise... ...to avoid any muscular atrophy Our subjects are in excellent physical condition, ready to be put to work Look at them. They are the solution for the future For industry, for the army No more unemployment or benefits In the event of an economic recession, back in the box We'll get them back out when things pick up again And there is really very little upkeep Every factory could have its own supply Same thing for the army. There would be no need for mobilisation Human silos near every border It amuses me to hear people say... ...that modern man behaves and lives as if he were a robot If only that were true Then the great minds would rule the world FURNITURE AUCTION HOUSE - Would you mind, Professor? - It would be a pleasure, Madam Florence? That's the name of a beautiful city, too Are you quite sure that you have this covered? You have my word. There is no one hiding inside and the doors are locked The station is 50 meters away and manned all night What more could you need? Give yourself up or I'll shoot Stop. Stop or I'll shoot. Shit, I didn't load it Kill them. Kill them all Help. They're calling us The red on their arms must be their sign of recognition It's a pity you forgot to load your gun, poet Listen, both of you I'm telling you this so you don't take any uncalculated risks The auction will take place as planned With his wounded wrist there is no chance that our man... ...the man without a face, as the press calls him, will come to the auction - He could send someone - That's unlikely We think he'll try to steal the seals from the new owner instead He seems to have risen to the bait Assuming there is a buyer. People will be afraid now Yes, but one of our men will buy them The seals will be taken to a place of our choosing... ...in the provinces that is easy to guard and we will wait for him there The next lot contains three seals... ...each bearing an obscure emblem from the Order of the Templars... ...dating from around 1300 Reserve price: 1,000 francs 1,000 francs Reserve price: 1,000 francs Any advance? 1,100 francs 1,100 francs to the gentleman opposite Any advance? For 1,100 francs... Any advance? 1,100 francs to the gentleman opposite No advance? For 1,100 francs, going... ...going... ...gone No, believe me No, I do not know anything at all about the Templars I have no intention of deciphering these scribbles Since you're so curious, let me tell you something... ...that will be of more interest to you than the contents of this suitcase I will find the key to the treasure... ...without translating the signs on the seals I will apply a much better method... dowsing I will load up my pendulums with a charge from these medallions Then I will wave my pendulums with their charge... ...over a big map That way I will explore the whole world... ...until my pendulums spring into action It's quite simple really. Look Notice how the antenna is moving... ...towards the medallion This medallion, just like the pendants we wear... ...and the key to the inner crypt... ...are made of alchemical gold This gold, as you know... ...is radioactive up to a point It emits a special radiation I think we are going to have to put this device... ...to good use The ciborium that the killer stole from our late brother, Maxime de Borrego... ...is also made of alchemical gold Thanks to this device, we will be able to find it again, wherever it is And wherever the ciborium is... ...our man cannot be far away This has just come in, sir Professor Petrie is declaring... ...that the seals of the Templars are fake "I authenticated them to help the law... "...to catch the killer of my friend, Maxime de Borrego" He has made a fool of me He must have thought he could get away with it I condemn Professor Petrie to death... ...for his lack of scientific integrity Send out a press release Warn the London offices that the deed will be done as soon as possible - Is the plane ready? - As always I'll leave right away I want to oversee things for myself Professor Petrie is very clever He has told the press that the Templar objects are fakes The thief will want his revenge and we'll have another case on our hands Have you seen this, boss? Special edition THE MAN WITHOUT A FACE I condemn Professor Petrie to death Just as I was saying It's in the hands of the English now I must phone Scotland Yard right away - You're phoning direct? - We have no time for formalities Hello? Get me Scotland Yard, please Superintendent Sorbier speaking. This is urgent Professor Louis Petrie is in danger. He has received a death threat I'll call back later The crypt is deep underground and difficult to get to They'll get there too late But... Just a minute, please, sir. I'm taking a photo But... Paul, we are to blame for the death of poor Professor Petrie Those seals were our idea It was me who forged them No one forced him to join the fight And why did he have to go proclaiming to everyone that the seals were fakes? This man without a face is everywhere In Paris, in London Paul, we have to get far away from here, anywhere, or he'll kill us, too I'm sure of it, Paul. Let's leave She's right - That's right - Mr de Borrego? This is Borrego speaking - A call from the provinces - I'll put you through to the police Hello? Superintendent Sorbier. What's going on? I'm phoning from a small village in Burgundy 300m outside the village are the ruins of a Templar master's residence We have just found your uncle 's corpse there But that's unbelievable It 's true. Come here right away with your friends I've ordered a car for you. It should be waiting outside your door Pick up Inspector Péclet on your way. He's on another case The driver has been warned What on earth is going on? - Mr de Borrego? - That's right Superintendent Sorbier sent me He won't escape me this time I'm pleased with my impersonation skills Even Mrs Sorbier was taken in Brothers, in a few hours we will have found Maxime de Borrego's killer We have pinpointed the neighbourhood he is hiding in The hour of vengeance is nigh Brother Templar This is Marc calling Templar here. I'm listening We have located our enemy Intervening group... ...to go to... ...13, Rue Fantôme... ...in front the Sidi Brahim café Bring a box of ammunition. You never know Over and out I always keep my promises I promised to spare your life if you told me everything you knew But I never promised not to entrust you to the good doctor He's going to give the three of you a very special treatment Stop. Danger. We are under attack. Stand by, all stations. Carry on without me, Doctor. Let's go They're going to take me again They'll say I'm insane They'll try and lock me up They'll stop my work But they'll never catch me I will escape them again. I will escape Police car sighted Withdraw immediately Police car sighted Withdraw immediately How did you find us? Our radios have for some time now been picking up... ...radio signals that acted as guides Following the lead of those radio waves... ...we were led right here CLOSED DUE TO ILLNESS So you're back, Miss Ermance? I just came back to collect a few belongings My niece has come to help me. Excuse us, we have a train to catch See you very soon, I hope Yes, very soon, I think Very soon
