REBOUND [2023] Happy watching :) This film is based on a true story. Busan, October 2010 Pass the ball! Come on. [Ahn Jae Hong] Here! [Lee Sin Young, Jung Jin Woon] [Kim Taek, Jung Geon Joo] [Kim Min, Ahn Ji Ho] [Screenwriter: Kim Eun Hee & Kwon Sung Whee] [Director: Jang Han Jun] What? Another basketball coach resigned? The basketball coach leaves one by one. How many times has this been? Not just coaches. Students who are good at playing also come out. After we train students, the basketball team in Seoul takes them all. Without a coach, basketball might last a while, but can't keep going. [Winner of the 30th National Basketball Competition for Boys and Girls Junior High School Level. Leader: Lee Kang Beom] What do you think, sir? Should we look for a new coach? Look no further. Since it's like this, what if we just disband the basketball team? Mister Headmaster… after all, it's too— Haven't you discussed it before? There is no hope for the basketball team. Disbanding the basketball team is the right decision for the sake of our school's reputation. Will our comrades agree with that? That's right, sir. Our basketball team has history and tradition. If we suddenly disband it, many may disagree. So? Do you have a solution? How about this? Instead of dismissing it, it's better for us to keep it for the students. We don't need to take part in any competition, just enough to maintain it. May also. What about the coach? Where can we find coaches who can teach but pay little? Nobody will. We still have to find it. You want him to be a trainer? Isn't 25 years old too young to be a coach? Why? Can't be a coach at 25 years old? What's with that face? Indians or what? Principal... He is young but he was MVP in national game. [Most Valuable Player: The player with the best performance] Right? Yes. And also, he's an alumni of our school. Isn't that great? This is for students only. How's the principal? Mr Wakasek, why do you keep poisoning Mr Principal like that? What do you mean poison? Then where can we find a trainer? Cheap ones are usually not good. Isn't cheap still useful? Come on. Yes, say hello. This is your new coach, Kang Yang-hwan Coach-nim. Hyeon. What? Hyeon. Kang Yang-hyun. This is trainer Kang Yang-hyeon. Clap. Hello. - Nice to meet you all— - I have a question, sir. Even if I join here, I can't join the match. Because my grades are dropping. I want to stop playing basketball. Excuse me. I also want to stop playing basketball. Excuse me. Wait! I should have stopped long ago. what do you want? Well... I... Yes? don't have any activity even though I stopped playing basketball. So I'm staying here. How about you? Same... like him. Oh I see. In that case... let's try it first! I will match my game with you guys. WHAT IS THAT?! Why throw it so hard? Just slowly! What are you doing?! rebounds You are okay? I told you to hold onto the ladder tightly. Excuse me. [What are you looking at? You moron] [Call Note: Han Jun-young, Mr. Oh] [Han Jun Young] The number you have dialed is busy. [Jun-young, have you discussed with your parents? I'm waiting for a call from you] [Gyeong Nam Middle School Basketball Team] [MVP of Gyeong Nam Middle School Basketball Team] [Busan Bank Youth Basketball Championship] [Choi Won-seok, Song Dong-gyu, Kim Jae-guk] [Print] [Wosang Middle School Basketball Team Members] [The MVP's Speech: "Dream Game With Team Members"] [Kim Jae-seok, a famous guard] [We can see the peak of Korean basketball] Hello, what is this with the mother of student Lee Sang-rok? Yes, hello ma'am. I'm the coach of Jung Ang Busan High School basketball team. Kang Yang-hyun. Yes. Hwi-moon High School in Seoul. Oh I see. Happy. What is this with the father of student Lee Cheol-won? [Cheon Ki-beom, Kim Dong-hee, ̶L̶e̶e̶ ̶C̶h̶e̶o̶l̶-̶w̶o̶n̶, Choi Won-seok, Song Dong-gyu, Kim Jae-seok] Hello, I'm the coach of Jung Ang Busan High School basketball team. Bad signal. [Shim Jae-yoon, ̶K̶i̶m̶ ̶M̶i̶n̶-̶s̶e̶o̶n̶g̶, Kim Du-hyeok, Lee Jong-myung] Hello, I'm the coach of Jung Ang Busan High School basketball team. Kang Yang-hyun. [̶K̶i̶m̶ ̶H̶y̶e̶o̶n̶g̶-̶j̶o̶o̶] I'm the coach of Jung Ang Busan High School's basketball team, Kang Yang-hyeon. [̶A̶h̶n̶ ̶J̶i̶-̶m̶i̶n̶] Hello, I'm the coach of the Jung Ang Busan High School basketball team— Hello? By the way! Go away! Continue your task! Busan Jung Ang High School? Sorry, I'm not interested. I will join the team in Seoul. [Nam Hyang Middle School] I won't be able to achieve anything by staying in Busan. - Well, I mean... - Excuse me. Okay, good luck, jerk! Come on. Just me! Here! Come on, block! Here! Have you ever played basketball? Never. Do you want to try playing basketball? I want to be a footballer like Zletan Ibrahimović. No. With your height, jump and perseverance, you are fit to play basketball. If you want to try, you will become a very amazing center. center? Yes, think about it. You think, in a girl group, who catches the most attention? Center. Correct. Our school name is "Jung Ang High School." [Jung Ang means "middle/center point] In English, "Center High School". Basketball needs a center. Where is your area of ​​residence? Jungang-dong. [Dong: equivalent to RW] Yes! It's anjir... This is called fate! Watch carefully. That's basketball. What you should focus on is under the basketball hoop. The one under the basketball hoop? Yes. Is he trying to catch the ball when the basketball falls out of the hoop? Not that one, this one. They even bumped into each other to catch the ball again, right? That's important. Fight physically. Fight physically. Can you see that one? Push, block, protect, then shoot. He can too. Who's he? Kang-ho, let's go first. Bye! Basketball is fun, right? ask me? Who are you, sir? I'm Jung Ang High School's basketball coach. Are you interested in playing basketball for real? Really? Ciyus! Really sir? Chamna~ What high school are you from? Jung Ang High School. You seem to be the excited type. OK, get to know each other. Now you are a team. One team? Yes. This is Hong Sun Gyu. This is Jung Kang Ho. One, one, one. His name is Cheon Ki-beom. [Yimho Middle School] His face is handsome. He is also good at playing basketball. He got the MVP title in last year's national championship. Even the team in Seoul wants it. But his height did not grow taller. Then he got slump. [Slump: the term for the decline or decline in the performance of an athlete] Now he is a player trapped by his slump. Jung Ang High School? Yes. If you want to join Jung Ang High School, I will allow you to play. I heard that none of the other teams gave you a summons. No. Many teams have contacted me. The team in Seoul also contacted me. Oh I see. But maybe not be a key player in the team. Players must play many matches to improve themselves. Still, I'm not interested. You don't like me, or you don't like the school? You don't want to trust a young trainer with little experience, do you? You still haven't got a call from the team in Seoul, have you? They are selecting players. Oh I see? It's two weeks away, but still in the process of selecting players? Let's grow together. I grow... you grow too. You said you were a professional player? You have no coaching experience. Is your salary over 1 million won? Of course not. You are such a person, right? Please find someone else. How come he knows my salary doesn't reach a million? He's a kid with good intuition. He could feel it. Come here. Good! guards. Easy! Hey! Bastard! What are you doing?! Bastard? Bastard! How old are you? What are you saying? Stupid brat! Bastard! stop it. How dare you jerk. Bastard! Dog! You really won't talk? At least you should say something. Stubborn child. Aigoo, thanks for working hard. Yes. Here, please. Thank You. Not you. Thank you, it's been bothered until this time. Can I help you? Excuse me sir. I am... this child's uncle. Oh really? Yes. Are you still not tired of making trouble? Didn't Uncle tell you? Didn't I tell you to prepare yourself for school? Look at you. He got into a fight with someone else and I was asking him the timeline. - Thank goodness you came, sir. - Yes. What's his name? - Name? - Yes. It was just a fight between teenagers. No big deal. His guardian has come and we just want to confirm his identity. If we find out who he is, then he can go home. - Oh I see. - Yes. His name? - Sorry, I answered the phone first. - Yes. Yes, with the police station. - Name. - Aigoo, hello! Bae Gyu Hyeok. Bae Gyu Hyeok. It's a bit complicated, huh. The oil is leaking. Yes, then... - Bae. - Fine? - No, Bae. - Bae? gyu. Ryu? Yes, we will check again. -Hyeok. - Hyeok? Aigoo, sorry sir. Please state your name and residential address. Bae. gyu. gyu. Hyeok. Hyeok? Bae Gyu-hyeok. Date of birth? Are you making a lot of money? Ahjussi, who are you? What does my job look like? Something about basketball? Hey?! Hey. I'm the coach of Jung Ang High School's basketball team. Do you want to play basketball with me? - Basketball? - Yes. Damn it. Damn it? Inviting people who are afraid of basketball to play basketball? are you scared? Does not seem. I think you really like basketball. It's fake. I just want to make more money. I don't know what happened to you. The thing you like... thing i like... the things we both like. Let's do it together. Life is not a big deal. Did you think I would believe those naive words? Your left side is weak, right? Either knee or ankle, you can't support your body. Is that why you stopped playing basketball? What nonsense is that? If not, that's great. Come on, play with me. Don't play with weird kids. You can play on the field, wearing the team uniform. Sounds fun, right? No. Whoa, stubborn head. You're stubborn. [Han Jun Young] Here he is! hey... Anyway think again about it. This is my business card. Just save it. I go yes! Keep it carefully, I don't give it to just anyone. Yes, Jun Young. how are you? [Email, phone number of Jung Ang Busan High School Basketball Team Coach, Kang Yang-hyeon] Is this a business card? God, his handwriting... Let's eat together. Oh yes. You must eat a lot. You've worked hard. Don't worry. A team in Seoul just called us. I've never even heard of his team. I refused them. He's eating. Why talk that is not important? He's stressed. Anyway, don't think about anything. Just eat. Let us eat. Yes? Hello. Yes, I am Cheon Ki-beom's father. Busan Jung Ang High School? Oh I see. Ki-beom isn't home. Why are you calling? What? Who? Han Jun-young will join? Han Jun-young is coming to our school. Who's he? The most important player in the team, not guard or forward, but center. If the center is high, every team in Seoul wants that center. But a center that every team in Seoul wants is coming to our school. He is a center who is 2.2m tall. When he's on the pitch, he's like a giraffe among the players. No need to worry about the game. With Han Jun-young around, it wasn't a dream to advance to the semifinals of the national championship. That is what I mean. Mr Principal. Han Jun-young will be a beacon for our school. You will see the light shining even from a great distance. Please, you may go. Yes sir. The most important thing in high school level basketball— I understand, please go. Most fafifu wasweswos. Yes, nice to meet you all! Starting today, I am your coach, Kang Yang-hyeon Coach. This means stop. Our first goal is the Gunsan match. From today, no personal life. Any question? Only this number of team members? Good question. Of course we will find many more players. Therefore, right now I'm looking for some great players. We just had one great player. The door is closed. The field is old-fashioned. The important thing is the people are new. Coach-nim, I can't play with him. You guys know each other? Me too. I can't play basketball with that jerk. What? Amsyong! I can go mad! You two, come here. You can't play together? You think this is a joke, you bastards?! I don't care if you guys are enemies or rivals! If you don't want to play basketball, get out right now! I don't need players like you! Get out of my sight on the count of three, all right? One! Two! Three! You all run 200 laps on the course now, start. Why are you silent?! Start! Start. Run faster! What if they give up if you teach them like that? I'm afraid one of them will leave. How long have you been there, sir? Why are you so surprised? What? You think I came to beat you up? No, no. Do you really want to do it? Why not? Am I not allowed to try it? Come on! Faster! If you don't train your legs, you can't play basketball! Up to 50 times! One two three. Good! Don't think it's difficult. Your journey is still long. If you want to increase your stamina, this is not enough. Push, push! Do it according to rhythm. Rhythm, rhythm. Change position. Use your knees. Shoot! Well, that's fine. Our first goal is to win. The second is also to win. The third is also to win. The fourth is also to win. What are you guys doing? Control in the middle is good. Push harder, be stronger! Big move. Big move. Okay! Okay! Good! Shoot! Shoot! Good. Let us eat. One two. Aigoooo~~ He is very tall. The team in Seoul must really want it. Why did he come here? When Han Jun-young was young, Kang Coach-nim was the first person to tell him to play basketball. I told you, he will definitely do well. Good grief... Shouldn't we be attending the meeting? Oh, um... We're in a meeting. What if students see you guys just hanging out like that? The teachers already knew that there would be awards for outstanding schools, right? Please take care of the students, so as not to cause trouble. Okay sir. Mr Principal. About the basketball team, now there is Han Jun-young and other kids who can play well. So I think we can count on them. Mr. Lee has a point, sir. In this case, perhaps the school can provide support. Hear... In my opinion, I don't believe in things like youth or passion. Just don't make trouble. All attacks must be started by Ki-beom and Jun-young will finish them in the end. That's the most likely way for our team to score. So create an opportunity to pass the ball to Jun-young. Give it to Jun-young. Jun-young. Good. Excellent! Here! Give it to Jun-young. Jung Kang-ho, didn't you see Jun-young behind you? Do not block access to Jun-young. Excuse me. But in front of me... I'll tell you one more time... Whatever chance comes his way, Jun-young has to score the ball. Repeat. What are you doing, Bae Gyu-hyeok? I just told you. Give it to Jun-young. But, Coach-nim... is it only Jun-young who can attack? If only Jun-young attacks, the opponent will focus on blocking him. I think too, Gyu-hyeok could have just hit the ball. Don't think about anything. All you have to know is to create opportunities to pass the ball to Jun-young. There is no other center that is as high and good as Jun-young on any other team. So we have to take advantage of it if a weak team like us wants to win. I already know our first opponent. Seoul Yongsan High School. Yongsan High School was named the best team for the second year in a row. But fear not! We will beat them, whether it's Yongsan or Hwimoon! I'll work out the plan, you just follow it. Understand? UNDERSTAND?! YES! Is your ankle swollen? We still have four more days. Get enough rest and don't forget to eat. In the morning I will pick you up. It's okay, don't worry. My father said he would take me there. We can meet at the stadium. So? Okay, hurry home, rest. See you later. Be careful on the way. Yes. Heh, jerk! When will you play properly? Your position is small forward, means you have to understand where your position is. Hey, bastard! Just passing the ball to Han Jun-young, is that basketball, bitch? Didn't you hear what Coach-nim said? We have to do it if we want to win! We? Nonsense! Not us, but you yourself. Shut your mouth, asshole! This is all you think, right? You were the best center. Son genius Cheon Ki-beom returns to the field. Shut your mouth, bitch! You have to shut up! Son of a bitch! - Come here, dear! - How dare you, asshole? Do you remember running away from a field in middle school? If you run away this time again, I'll kill you, you damn bastard! Just kill it, bitch! I will make you unable to play basketball anymore, you bastard! Free! WHAT ARE YOU GUYS?! You're crazy! Why are you guys fighting and strangling each other? I have clearly warned you two. If we fail because of you two, I will not stay silent. Understand? Yes. Yes. Here we introduce the name of the school that was invited to the sixth Gunsan Mayor Award basketball game. Come in! Spirit! Coach-nim has come. Jun-young still hasn't come? Yes, he hasn't come yet. I'll go pick up Jun-young. You guys go in first and get changed, then warm up a bit. Yes, good. Oh, that's Yongsan High School. [Yongsan High School] [Yongsan] Sunbae-nim. Hello. - Kang Yang-hyun. - Yes. Long time no see. how are you? Boy, now you really look like a trainer. Happy. Thank You. Please help for today. Help what do you mean. But it seems you don't know about that. We weren't the first to contact him. Isn't that Jun Young? Why is Jun-young there? Jun-young! I'm afraid that you might misunderstand. His parents contacted us first. Don't hate Jun-young so much. He really wants to join your team, but his family doesn't agree. Your position has been changed. Hong Sun-gyu's center. Power Forward, Jung Kang-ho. Small Forward, Bae Gyu-hyeok. Shooting guard, Park Yoon-ho. Point Guard is still Cheon Ki-beom. Even if your position suddenly changes, We certainly can. Okay? Yes, right. Good! Shoot! [Jung Ang Busan High School First Elimination Round Seoul Yongsan High School] Attention! Regards. Battle begin! Attack from Yongsan High School. Find your position! Yongsan High passes to Baek-jin. Heo-hun catches him... Then dunk shots and goals! Shoot! Heo-hun Seonsu got triple points in just three moves. Yes. Yongsan High School earns points with its relaxed physique. Focus! Cheon Ki-beom slowly dribbled the ball towards the defense of Yongsan High School. Cheon Ki-beom does a feint move then shoots... Very good! Great basketball game! Heo-hun continues to dribble the ball. Heo-hun breaks through the blocking then lay-up and goals! Wow, Heo-hun is really reliable! Yongsan High School went straight to the front. Cheon Ki-beom Seonsu can't pass the ball. He has to pass it in 8 seconds. There's not enough time. 8 second violation. [The time allowed for a team to play the ball in its own half. If more than 8 seconds, it is considered a violation] Yongsan High School uses a special strategy that makes Jung Ang High School confused. Busan Jung Ang High School, it's a pity. Yes. This game is not going well for them. Now it's time for the attack from Yongsan High School. The ball is passed to Heo-hun. Heo-hun shoots triple point from his position and... Clean shot! Heo-hun Seonsu never stops. [Yongsan High School 6 - 2 Jung Ang High School] He's so great! The points are quite different for the two teams. Yongsan High School is getting more and more aggressive. The ball is passed to Kim-han. Kim-han Lay up and... goal in! Jung Ang Busan High School is lagging behind. Focus! - It seems that their cooperation is not good. - Focus! Jung Ang Busan High School tries to strike back. Bae Gyu-hyeok is trying to pass the ball to someone. Cheon Ki-beom Seonsu was ready but he immediately broke through. Bae Gyu-hyeok failed to shoot! Then Yongsan High School fought back. Then... goal in! He should have handed it over to Cheon Ki-beom. Pass the ball faster. Jung Ang Busan High School tries to attack. - Cheon Ki-beom has the ball again. - Hey! back again! The coach is giving orders to the players. Bae Gyu-hyeok tried to break through from the inside. - Then he fell! - Referee! Hey! The judge ordered them to continue. Yongsan High School continues to attack. Their speed got faster. Heo-hun tries to break through on his own. He earns points. Jung Ang Busan High School met the best team, namely Yongsan High School which showed their superior strength. Unlucky! Looks like their stamina is starting to decrease. They couldn't keep up with Yongsan High's pace. Here. Cheon Ki-beom. He looked at Bae Gyu-hyeok. But he didn't pass the ball and tried to shoot. But failed! Therefore, it will be difficult. Cooperation with each other! It seems they have problems with teamwork. Hong Sun-gyu Seonsu couldn't find his position. Yes. Heo-won Seonsu can pass the ball behind so he can shoot easily. Yongsan High School is very fast. They ended very well. It's bad luck for Jung Ang Busan High School to have a match against Seoul Yongsan High School. Focus! Focus! Maybe the results are obvious. [Yongsan High School 23 - 10 Jung Ang High School Busan] The scale and history of their team has a big difference. Yongsan High School continues to gain points. The difference in points grew further as time went on. The players from Busan Jung Ang High School were too tired even though it was still the first round. What kind of plan does Jung Ang Busan High School have? Who knows. Apart from winning or losing, players need to accumulate experience through matches. Jung Kang-ho passed the ball. Cheon Ki-beom gets the ball. He fell. Beats? Offense! The referee considers it an offensive foul. [Fouls that occur when a player bumps into an opponent who is charging or correct hands up] Yes, the referee said it was offensive foul - Number seven, foul. - This is a rather ambiguous situation. Are you kidding? This is nonsense. High school coach Jung Ang will ask the referee. How could that be considered offense? Jung Ang High School coach, T-Foul, one shot. [A violation occurred when someone cursed the referee and protested openly.] All right, let's go. Hey, hey, hey! Watch carefully! You've been giving offense ever since! Jung Ang Busan High School Coach, T-Foul, Leave the field! Calm. Coach Kang Yang-hyeon was asked to leave the court. Hey! Hey! What? If you don't want to pass, you should be able to score points. You're not very good at it, why only play alone? The person who will catch the ball pass must stand in position. What? You can't because of your ankle injury? Hey, bastard! You are crazy? Referee. What is it? All stop! Jung Ang High School, leave the field! No! It can't be! Wait! Wait. Tell the referee! Do not do it. Don't cause any more trouble. [Jung Ang Foam High School Failed. Coach: "I want to apologize to the referee"] [Jung Ang Busan High School banned from matches for 6 months.] [Unprecedented severe punishment] Where is he? Let's go find him. Follow me. Is it true you're the coach? I heard they were banned from competing. Who do you think you are, you dare to stand in my son's way? Say. What should we do? Excuse me. Forget it. See you later if you dare to contact my son again. I will not stay silent! Let's go! Good grief. Can't coach, why are you a trainer? Why are you silent? You think this makes sense? I don't care. Why do you stay there all the time? Let's go. Hello. I am the second Michael Jordan who will save the future of the great Jung Ang High School. My name is Jung Jin-uk from Doha Middle School! Jung Ang High School is in danger and I will save it in one year. Then I'll show off my basketball skills. I'll show you. Check this out, Coach-nim. Coach-nim. Coach-nim! I'm the second Michael Jordan. Go there, Jordan. You must go to America. Jung Ang High School... have no future. Go there, to Chicago. Cheers, Coach-nim! Busan Jung Ang High School, hwaiting! Hwaiting! Hwaiting! Yes, good! Kawi, Gawi, Bo! Let's see who loses. Excellent! [Quote: Look Not Here, But At The Blackboard] "Seat". This is important. This... Hey! Shucks! What's your name? You think this is your bedroom? [Kang Yang-hyun interview] [Basketball Diary, Kang Yang-hyeon] Kang Yang-hyeon Seonsu, you were voted the best player in this match. Please say a few words. First of all, I thank my trainer a lot. Not only me but also Won-seok, Ji-Seong, Jong-myeong and all our players have worked very hard. I didn't think I could be a winner. Thank you very much. It seems that now you are very emotional and moved. What kind of player do you want to be in the future? I want to play basketball happily and enjoy it for the rest of my life. Why do you like basketball? I don't even know. I like it very much. [Rebound: Got a new chance to make amends and failures. Techniques that can turn failure into success, don't give up! Are you home? Astagfirulloh! Ki-beom, I'm guilty. I am wrong. You're... crying...? When I was the coach of Jung Ang High School, I thought like this. Even though my life as an athlete is over, my basketball life is not over. I want to show people who belittled and looked down on me. Hey you bastards! Kang Yang-hyun is not dead! This... Shut up! I'm talking! Already. I tried to do it.... according to my plan. But it didn't work. And I realized... that this is not playing basketball. So? Should we give it one more try? I will change. Let's do something that we are good at, that makes us happy and crazy. Should we give it one more try? Basketball. From now on... I don't want to do it alone anymore. Let's do it together, with others. Really? Really. Ki-beom. Hug me. I'm really struggling. Aigoo. Why are you crying? Because I'm happy. Thank You. Ready. Launch! Hold on tighter. Start. Come on! Faster! Take! 10 minute rest. Jung Kang Ho! Hong Sun Gyu! Coach-nim! Ki-beom! Ki-beom! How about rugby, you like it? It's so tight! The ball is very small, and I'm not used to it. The best ball is only basketball, right? I miss you, Coach-nim! Wait! Come on, quickly! Turn right. Go right, go right. Here. Hello. Wow, you're Ki-beom, right? Aigoo, long time no see. Why don't you play here often? - Good news, ma'am? - Yes. This is our basketball team. Who's he? He is fat and cute. [Award] I have nothing to serve. Why come so suddenly? Aigoo, I'm busy working for a living. So no time to meet Mr. Coach. Aigoo, thank you. Forgive me for not recognizing you. It's okay, ma'am. We suddenly came here. No problem. Gyu-hyeok stopped playing basketball because of his ankle injury. It was very difficult for him. But he met you and started over. He is so happy. Thank you very much sir. No ma'am. Gyu-hyeok is actually proficient. Gyu-hyeok, my son... maybe from outside... he looks rough and fierce. But actually he is a soft-hearted child. I don't have enough money to get him to have ankle surgery. As his mother, I only gave him burden and trouble. Don't worry, ma'am. Gyu-hyeok sure is fine. - He's fine, right? - Yes, right. Son of a bitch! Give me the 50,000 you took from them you bastard! You can't play basketball. Why are you mad at me? How great are you, to dare to be so arrogant? Heh, tell me the truth. You're a professional player, right? If not, why are you so good at it? No, he's not an athlete. How did he become a professional player? From his face it was obvious... he is a person who can not play basketball. Ahjussi, just go. Don't meddle here. I'm not Ajussi. I'm a young man who really likes basketball. How? Want to fight mechanics 1 on 1 with me? Coach-nim, that doesn't seem like a good idea. What a runny-nosed kid. He's nothing. This ajussi has a hard time standing. After all, why use everything? Even humiliated. So... have to play basketball a lot. Gyu-hyeok, I'm guilty. How about we start together again? Don't want to? I'm not going to throw the ball again. to the referee. Correct! You have to throw the ball to other players! But, Coach-nim... Will the school allow us to play? Don't worry! I'm already really bestie with Mr. Principal! Ciyusan? If I told him, he would definitely give permission right away! Why are you guys worried about that? Principal, please help us. This is my mistake. I'm a sinner. Please give me one more chance for the future of the children. If you mind giving me last month's salary, You don't need to give me a trainer's salary. I will do volunteer work for my alma mater. Mr Principal. I don't know which school principal he is from... also, don't know what kind of opportunity. Give him another chance. Yes? - Yeobo, can you give him another chance? - Just help him! I'm so ashamed of the neighbors. Hey, Principal! do you hear? You talk to him instead of me. Tell him that I understand and send him home. Huh? Why is that? It's so stupid that he wants to play basketball or something. Just allow it. Just pretend wéh, that's it! Principal, please help him! As I expected, the Principal really supports us to play basketball again. Clap. From now on, we will practice intensively according to each other's strengths. After 6 months, we'll be attending league matches when new students arrive. Our goal is to qualify for the preliminary round. In other words, qualify for the finals. Sun-gyu and Kang-ho, you must practice physical combat and rebound strategies From now on, you guys should try your best for shooting... if you have the opportunity to be under the basketball hoop. Really? From now on, the two of you are the center and power forward of the Jung Ang High School basketball team. Waahhh~~ really coy!! We really become center and power forward. Because Gyu-hyeok's ankles were weak, So you have to practice as I instructed during the rehabilitation training. Good. Ki-beom, you can shoot or pass the ball as you like. However, you have to focus on the other players' positions. Good. Okay. Try me? Yes! Kuy! Come on! Sun-gyu, Ki-beom. Kang-ho. Sun-gyu. Enter! Come on. [Sun-gyu and Kang-ho interrupt.] Come on! Sun-gyu. Run back. Come on, come on! Hong Sun Gyu. Sun Gyu, where are you? Eat this! We are suten. Kawi, Bawi, Bo! [Welcome to the 2012 New Student and Student Welcoming Ceremony] You signed up to join our basketball team? Yes. You... Jordan? Hello! I am the second Michael Jordan who will save the future of the great Jung Ang High School! The basketball genius, my name is Jung Jin-uk! If you? My name is Heo Jae Yoon. I joined the basketball team since 4th grade. I've never played as a player. But my passion and persistence... So your name is Heo Jae-yoon? Yes. We'll try it from you first, okay? What is wrong? Well that's that then. Stop. Is it true you never joined the basketball team? Yes. Until now, how many times have you entered the competition? Never though. But I really like basketball. Please allow me to join this team. OK, next. Jordan. Coach-nim! See, right? I am the future Jung Ang High School, Jung Jin-uk. Shoot... Coach-nim! I'm the basketball genius, Jung Jin-uk. Five-person fast attack strategy. Ki-beom and Jin-uk exit the game area, While Sun-gyu and Kang-ho to the other side of the area. Gyu-hyeok passes the ball to Sun-gyu and breaks into the opponent's area. One problem we have to overcome, namely physical strength, stamina. You have to move to give each other space and opportunities. So, you have to move faster than your opponent to get a chance. That means teamwork is... the most important thing for us. Here, for you. - The meat is done. - Eat a lot. Okay, now let's order fried rice, shall we? Not yet. We haven't had our fill of meat yet. The total is 324,000 Won. Can it be paid in 24 month installments? What? If we're at the back, you have to enter at a 45 degree angle. I will immediately shoot. So, let me just put it this way. Then where should I go? - Hadeuuuhhh... - Here! - Jung Ang High School! - Eaaaa! One. Just relax. Two. Come on, try again. Three. Do not stop. May I borrow Jun Ji-hyun's standee for a moment? Come on, come on! Here. - Kang-ho, you swing backwards to Yoona. - Yes. Sun-gyu. Sun-gyu, you screen Yoo Jae-seok. If you want screen to Yoo Jae-seok, you have to stick to Han Ye-seul. Correct! Jin-uk, leave Jun Ji-hyun and turn towards Yoona. Come on, come on. Sun-gyu, Sun-gyu. Good. You have to shoot the ball like this. Oiy, Bae Gyu-hyeok! Didn't you hear? You have to pass the ball to Jun-young. But Coach-nim, Jun-young isn't here. How to pass to him? Even if there isn't one, you should still pass it on to Jun-young. If not, then what should I do? Even if it's not there, it still has to be passed. But he's not here, so how do you pass him on? - Just keep loving! - But he's not here. Just love it! Hey, Bae Gyu-hyeok! You have to pass the ball to Jun-young. - Jung Ang High School! - Eaaaa! Jung Ang High School, we will definitely pass the preliminaries! We will win!

[May 4, 2012, opening ceremony of the 37th basketball tournament] [Hansungbu High School Success]! [Success at Jaemulpo High School] [Yongsan High School Basketball Team] He's pretty great. Pledge. Players will obey the rules and will play fairly. We will do our best during the match. May 4, 2012, the cast's representative, Heo-hun from Yongsan High School. Hello ladies and gentlemen. The 37th National Junior High School Basketball Championship for Boys and Girls. The first preliminary round will see Jung Ang Busan High School take on Sinan High School. First, from Jung Ang Busan High School. They have the fewest members in this match. Yes, they only have six members. And four of them had never played basketball before they entered high school. They didn't have much experience and were weaker than other teams. [May 5, 2012, First Elimination Round of Jung Ang Busan High School VS Sinan High School] Come on! Yes, the whistle signaling the start of the game has been sounded. There! Sinan player number 6. He always tends to break through. If Ki-beom opens up space, Kang-ho has to take that position first. Kang-ho. It doesn't matter! Closer, tighter! Slowly. Kang-ho. Find your position. Ki-beom. Catch the ball. Come on, come on! Correct! Pass! Pass! Good! Come on faster! Fast attack! Come here. Good! What a game! Sun-gyu. Yes, good! How great you all are! It's okay, come on! [Sinan High School 6 - 0 Jung Ang Busan High School] I have recorded your practice for the past 4 months. Yes. If you can't picture the whole game in your head, the efforts of your teammates will be wasted. The look in your eyes, the movement of your hand, your actions, everything that you do, will be followed by the members of your one team. Player 23 Sinan's job is to make plans. He'd probably already imagined the pattern Kang-ho and Jin-uk had followed. Player number 1 is being watched by Sun-gyu. So, the rear position will be open. Then Gyu-hyeok had a chance to put the ball in. Now is the time. Yes, this is with Jung Ang Busan High School. I want to ask you something. May I know how the Jung Ang Busan High School match is going? Yes. Oh, just finished? Yes. What? 85 against 42? The difference in points is quite large. Yes. WHAT?! WIN! Ouch, hot! Win! Don't worry! what's wrong? This is awesome. Menaaaaanggg!!! 85 against 42. No one expected that Jung Ang Busan High School would win against Sinan High School. We won! They look completely different compared to last year. The cooperation between Cheon Ki-beom Seonsu and Bae Gyu-hyeok Seonsu is very good. - This is just the beginning. - Yes. Don't be so proud. Bathe. And get ready for tomorrow. Yes! I don't think we will win! Did you see that? Jung Ang High School! Spirit! Jaemulpo High School is an aggressive team. Their physique is also good. Ki-beom and Gyu-hyeok, you got 26 points in the first round. They will attack you intensively. Cheon Ki-beom gets the ball. [May 6, 2012, Second Elimination Round of Jung Ang Busan High School VS Jaemulpo High School] He headed straight for the ring. Jaemulpo Incheon High School is a strong team. They really focused on Cheon Ki-beom and Bae Gyu-hyeok. Jaemulpo High School wants to block them and drain them of their strength. It's a spontaneous strategy. Don't mind other people. Just focus on Jung Ang numbers 7 and 10. Do it aggressively! It doesn't matter! Jaemulpo High School's strategy is still effective today. Choi Ji-wook passed the ball. Choi Woo-sik shooting and... enter! It doesn't matter! Jung Ang High School must turn things around. Sun-gyu is blocked. Kang-ho was also trapped under the ring. Means Jin-uk who must enter the ball. Hyung-nim! The real match starts now. Jung Kang-ho passed to Hong Sun-gyu. Then Bae Gyu-hyeok got the ball. He looked outside. He passed the ball to Jung Jin-uk. Then Jung Jin-uk tried shooting... And... come in! Jung Jin-uk is amazing! He demonstrated his abilities confidently. Jung Jin-uk turned things around. He got the ball. He's trying to shoot from under the ring... And, come in! Because Cheon Ki-beom and Bae Gyu-hyeok were prevented, Jung Jin-uk is the mainstay for scoring points. Come on. Jung Jin-uk in his prime condition tries a feint move then shoots... But missed then Hong Sun-gyu got the ball. Lay-up and enter! Jung Jin-uk became stronger and gave Hong Sun-gyu an opportunity to show himself. [Jaemulpo High School 51 VS 60 Jung Ang Busan High School] Jung Ang Busan High School made the atmosphere even more exciting. Jung Jin-uk took possession of the ball. He passed the ball to Jung Kang-ho. He tried to score two points and put the ball in calmly. Good! Jung Jin-uk made the team's atmosphere more lively. Jung Ang Busan High School performed well. Cheon Ki-beom passes the ball to Bae Gyu-hyeok. And then Jung Jin-uk got the ball. Jin-uk! Cheon Ki-beom has the ball again. Block! Cheon Ki-beom broke through. Then lay-ups... He scored two points for his team. Jung Ang Busan High School became a completely different team in the space of one year. Come on, come on! This is awesome. Gyu-hyeok, swing! Hyung-nim! Jin-uk! - Jin-uk! - Medical team. Jin-uk! Where does it hurt? It seems that Jung Jin-uk is lying on the ground. You are okay? He fell on the pitch and couldn't get up. Hopefully the wound isn't too bad. - Here? - Yes. He must be taken to the hospital immediately. No sir. I can play. Coach-nim. I can play. Jin-uk! Let's go to the hospital first. I'll catch up after the match is over. It seems that Jung Jin-uk's left shoulder is broken. Come on, quickly. And the injuries look terrible. Shouldn't they change players? Yes, Jung Jin-uk Seonsu can't play in this condition. Yes. They had no choice but to change players. The only player left was Heo Jae-yoon. Jae-yoon, get ready. I? Apart from you, is there anyone else? It's 5 minutes left. Previously, Heo Jae-yoon had no history of participating in official matches. Yes, it is true. Although Heo Jae-yoon had joined the basketball team since elementary school, but this is his first experience following a basketball game. This is a big change. I can do it. I can do it. Yes, right. Heo Jae-yoon who has no experience playing official matches. That's why he looks so nervous. It is possible that Heo Jae-yoon will determine whether they win or not. - Cheon Ki-beom Seonsu started the game. - Jae-yoon, over there. He passed it to Bae Gyu-hyeok. - Bae Gyu-hyeok pass it on to Heo Jae-yoon. - Jae Yoon. Ah, but Heo Jae-yoon Seonsu can't catch it. Maybe he doesn't really understand the official moves of basketball because of his lack of experience in matches. Come on, come on! Heo Jae-yoon was like a lost child. He had a hard time adapting to the game. Jung Ang Busan High School is in another dilemma. Heo Jae-yoon had a hard time keeping up with their game. Jae-yoon, find your position. He couldn't follow the player in the right way. Block! Hong Seok-gun got the ball then shoot and... in! Jaemulpo High School earns points. Jung Ang Busan High School must maintain score with time remaining. Because Jaemulpo High School counterattacked fiercely. Lee Kyeong-sin, Lay-up. And score points again. The match is over. Even though Busan Center High School wins Jaemulpo High School Busan Center High School Game over. Even though Jung Ang Busan High School won over Jaemulpo High School, but Busan Jung Ang High School has a new PR, namely Heo Jae-yoon Seonsu. [Seongje Hospital] Just sit. How is the condition? There he goes. You've come, sir. What did the doctor say? Her clavicle was broken. He had to rest completely for three months. Good grief. I'm going to fight. I want to continue playing basketball.... with seniors. Can't I compete? Who's stopping you? We will play basketball forever. So, you have to recover yourself first. Gyu-hyeok you get your ankle checked while we're at the hospital. It's okay sir. No, even though it's fine now, but you've already played two games. Just check. I'm totally fine, sir. If you feel sick, I will tell you first. I want to rest first. If you don't have backup players, it will be difficult to play. Moreover, Heo Jae-yoon couldn't play the basics. Even though he had tried matching games. But the match will start in 4 days. Can we join the competition? Attention, the match is about to start... Jae Yoon. If you don't have confidence to shoot or pass, then don't. What do you mean? Block the player Ki-beom pointed at. That's right. If you do that, I think we can win. Is there any problem? Nothing, sir. Why are you so weak? Eat something. [Jung Jin Uk] [Jung] [Jung Jin Uk] Cheers for us. Yes. Okay, let's try our best! Come on!! Jung Ang High School, cheers! Jung Ang High School played well in the previous game. But they are in crisis because they do not have reserve players. And in this match they will face Hansungbu High School, one of the strongest of the strongest teams. The third preliminary round was between Jung Ang Busan High School and Hansungbu High School will start soon. [May 8, 2012, Third Elimination Round. Busan Jung Ang High School VS Hansungbu High School] Cheon Ki-beom has the ball. He dribbled and advanced slowly. He was looking for space to break through. Cheon Ki-beom passes the ball to Bae Gyu-hyeok. Back to Cheon Ki-beom. Cheon Ki-beom broke through. But Kang Sang-jae blocked it. Kim Hong-gu got the ball. He passes it on to Kang Sang-jae. Kang Sang-jae, lay-up. Kang Sang-jae earned a point. Kang Sang-jae performs very well every year. Yes, right. If Yongsan High School had Han Jun-young, then at Hansungbu High School there is Kang Sang-jae who serves as a center who is extraordinary. Bae Gyu-hyeok tries to shoot... Too bad it failed. Hansungbu High School attacked very quickly. Kang Sang-jae gets the ball. Oh, Heo Jae-yoon Seonsu. Block him directly. He looks different. Kim Hong-gu couldn't break through. Heo Jae-yoon's defense was very good. Good! Hansungbu High School missed his pass. Heo Jae-yoon led his team out of the encirclement. Jae Yoon, great! Hae Jae-yoon showed us a very good defense. Come on, come on! The ball was passed to Hong Sun-gyu. He passed it back. And returned to Hong Sun-gyu again. Just shoot and enter! Defense. - Come on! - Hong Sun-gyu is very tall. Yes. He took advantage of his advantage to attack the opponent's weak point. The ball went to Jeon Jun-sik. Then it was given to Kang Sang-jae. Kang Sang-jae jumped up. Good! Kang Sang Jae. It's hard to see a dunk shot like this in a high school match. But Kang Sang-jae did. The competition between these two teams is very tight. Keep the spirit! Scramble for rebounds. Bae Gyu-hyeok is looking forward to the ball, then passed it to Cheon Ki-beom. Cheon Ki-beom is breaking through. Cheon Ki-beom, lay-up, shoot! And enter! In the first and second preliminary rounds, Bae Gyu-hyeok and Cheon Ki-beom contributed a lot of points. But in this game, all Jung Ang High School players try to score points. -4+4+3 = 3. So the bottom line is... What is it? What is it? What are you doing? Game over. Jung Ang Busan High School, which did not have any reserve players, made it to the quarter-finals. [Hansungbu High School 58 - 69 Jung Ang Busan High School] We passed the preliminary round. We're through to the quarter-finals! Those who don't know for sure think they won the final round. - Jung Ang High School! - Eaaa!! We're through to the quarter-finals! Sun-gyu, rest. Don't hold your knees. Where's Gyu-hyeok? He went to the toilet. Is he constipated? - Jump! - Come on! Dock, dock! What are you doing? Take this. Grab it fast, it smells bad! How's your ankle? Is that okay? You are crazy. Can't you see how I run? I'm greater than you. Naturally, my friend. Or you won't be able to use your ankles forever. Don't worry about me. What? You want to score points? We still have a long way to go. You have to remember that we don't have... substitute player. At that time, I don't want to get into trouble. I hate my injured ankle. I also hate my family condition... who can't pay for my treatment. So I ran away. Excuse me. Until now, the difference in points between Jung Ang Busan High School and Gwangsan High School is getting further. [May 10, 2012, Quarter-finals. Busan Jung Ang High School VS Gwangsan High School] keep going! Kim Hyun-joong passed the ball to Park Jin-su. The space is getting wider. Gwangsan High School, drive in. Gwangsan High School got two points. [Gwangsan High School 28 - 21 Jung Ang Busan High School] The defense strategy has been changed. - They turned it into a full court press. - Yes. This full court press strategy was carried out with the aim of [Defense full court press is a situation where a team will play defense] torturing the physically exhausted Busan high school player Jung Ang Ang. [all over the court hoping to trap or take the ball from the opponent] At this time, Bae Gyu-hyeok lost the ball. Gwangsan High School, put the ball in again. And get two more points. It's okay, just take it slow. Gwangsan High School continues to bully. Again. Jung Ang High School gets the ball again. Pass! Jung Ang High School gets the ball again. Jung Ang Busan High School tries to break through no matter what. So true. Bae Gyu-hyeok passed the ball. But the pass missed. Park Jin-su got the ball. Jung Ji Hun. Lay-ups. And get two more points. There is a difference of 13 points between the two teams. They were able to reach this round without any backup players, so their stamina was completely drained. You guys just block Cheon Ki-beom, then we'll win. You're tired, right? We must save our energy. Change your positions. They're exhausted. Gwangsan High changed their players again. Hwaiting! The Jung Ang Busan High School players must have felt the floor of the court pulling them down. JungAng! Cheon Ki-beom Seonsu ordered them to hold on. They changed their positions. Jung Kang-ho Seonsu stepped forward. Then there are the tall power forwards blocking the guards. Jung Kang-ho blocked Kim Hyun-joong. Jung Kang-ho's good defense. Come on, come on! Managed to get the ball. Then try to shoot.... and get two points. [Gwangsan High School 38 - 23 Jung Ang Busan High School] So Coach Gang Yang-hyeon's strategy worked. Jung Ang High School, awesome! Jung Kang-ho blocked Kim Hyun-joong. He continues to follow. He blocked his shooting. Hong Sun-gyu immediately passed the ball. Jung Kang-ho, lay-up. And another point for Jung Ang High School. And one, and one! [And one: when a player is fouled while shooting and the ball enters the basket] Jung Kang-ho Seonsu, hasn't he been playing basketball for a long time? Yes. He played basketball officially when he just entered high school. You could say he is a new player in the branch of basketball. The atmosphere of today's match changed 180°. Hong Sun-gyu blocked. Hong Sun-gyu saved another pass. Jung Ang Busan High School continues to run. Bae Gyu-hyeok, Hong Sun-gyu. Hong Sun-gyu, lay-up. And... come in! Even Hong Sun-gyu also contributed points. Jung Kang-ho Seonsu performed brilliantly. Hong Sun-gyu also showed his existence. Why are you guys playing like that? Do you want your reboud to be constantly snatched away? I tried my best but it didn't work. Anyway block! Follow him, approach! Gwangsan High School continues to block. Cheon Ki-beom breaks through while dribbling the ball. He passed the ball to Bae Gyu-hyeok. Bae Gyu-hyeok passed again to Cheon Ki-beom. Cheon Ki-beom is increasingly passing the ball. Hong Sun-gyu, lay-up and succeeded! Hong Sun-gyu scored consecutive points. Gyu-hyeok! Jung Ang Busan High School's biggest problem is stamina. Because basketball is a sport that requires a lot of energy Generally, high school basketball teams have 15 to 18 players. But Jung Busan High School only has five players. Jung Ang Busan High School is actually impossible to play with just five players. You pay attention to each other's positions. Especially Ki-beom, you need defense so Gyu-hyeok has to support him. Good. Bae Gyu-hyeok dribbled the ball. Given to Cheon Ki-beom. Back to Bae Gyu-hyeok. He took the ball straight ahead. Lay-ups. He managed to earn points. - Good! - Bae Gyu-hyeok is amazing. At this rate, the results are unpredictable. [Gwangsan High School 49 - 45 Jung Ang High School Busan] [Independent Learning] SEMIFINAALLLL!!! JungAng! We're advancing to the semifinals! Yes, Jung Ang Busan High School made it to the semifinals. This is awesome. Jung Ang Busan High School shows the impossible turning into reality. Is this something that could possibly happen? Jung Ang Busan High School is amazing! We're in the semifinals! Semifinals! There was an unexpected incident at the national basketball championship. The main hero is Jung Ang Busan High School. Without reserve players, with only five players, they won the game. With extraordinary stamina and ability, Jung Ang Busan High School achieved unbelievable results. Leading them to the semifinals of the national basketball championship. They beat Gwangsan High School with 77-44 points. Why do we have to leave the basketball court? The headmaster underestimated us. You stupid battery! What? What? What did you say? What? Oh, it's nothing. Oh yes, sleep. Yes. Maybe it's hard to believe, but we can go this far. Even if we lose, let's enjoy the game. Yes. Come on! One two three. This is Jung Ang Busan High School. Due to their limited stamina, it would be difficult for them to compete. [May 11, 2012, Semifinals. Busan Jung Ang High School VS Anyang High School] Also, there is a big difference in the number of players. Anyang High School has 17 players, while Jung Ang High School only had 6 players. Because Jung Ji-uk was injured, they didn't have any substitutes. They used to have 6 members, but now they have to compete with a 5-player formation. Anyang High School rebounded. Come on, come on, come on! The match is still going on. Kwon Jung-bin gets the ball pass. Sang-ho. He saw Lee Jong-su while breaking through. Lee Jong-su pushed and headed for the basketball hoop. Enter, enter! Calm down, take it slow. Anyang High School played well. Choi Seung-won has the ball. Lay-ups. [Anyang High School 19 - 6 Jung Ang High School Busan] Points for Anyang High School. Anyang High School is an extraordinary team that has very fast guard players. Park Ju-hyeon passes to Park Sung-joo. Park Sung-joo, shoot. Cheon Ki-beom is being blocked. He couldn't pass the ball. He gave it to Heo Jae-yoon with difficulty. Don't be discouraged. I can do it. Jae Yoon, shoot! Heo Jae-yoon, shoot.... Anyang High School players know that Heo Jae-yoon can't shoot. So they purposely didn't get in the way. Actually, Jung Ang Busan High School looks like playing with only 4 people. Defense focused on Cheon Ki-beom and Bae Gyu-hyeok. At this rate, the Jung Ang Busan High School players must put in 200% of their energy. Without substitutes, Jung Ang Busan High School competes non-stop 5 times a week. Shoot... Not in. The rebound also failed. At the same time, their stamina was getting drained. Anyang High School continues to attack. Choi Seung-won passes to Lee Jong-su. Lee Jong-su returned to Choi Seung-won. Perfect lay-up and go in! Anyang High School leads 10 points ahead of Busan's Jung Ang High School. Jung Ang Busan High School has a long way to go to catch up. In critical moments like this, it's very easy for players to commit fouls. The good cooperation of Anyang High School greatly hindered Busan Jung Ang High School. As of now, no changes have occurred. Good! Continue! Come on, you can do it! Jung Ang High School tries to attack. Cheon Ki-beom was blocked inside. - He can't pass to anyone. - Come here. Difficult situation. Then he passed it to Heo Jae-yoon. Just leave it. Don't mind him. Shoot.... For 8 years and until this game, he has no official playing record or points scoring record. But everyone here already knows, who really loves basketball and really wants to play well. And who trains alone every night. It's clear that rivals won't pay attention to you, Jae-yoon. So Jae-yoon has two chances this time. Two chances to get triple point. Heo Jae-yoon, everyone has their first experience. I am also like that. This match is the beginning of all your records. Enter! Jung Ang Busan High School is back! Heo Jae-yoon's first point was a triple point. [My son Heo Jae Yoon, Hwaiting!] My son Heo Jae-yoon, you are great! what's wrong with him? um... Jae-yoo, come on! Jae-yoon holds the ball once again. Heo Jae-yoon, triple point shoot... [Anyang High School 27 - 16 Jung Ang High School Busan] Hey! You said he joined the game just to equalize the number of players? Heo Jae-yoon got triple point for the second time. If this continues, Jung Ang Busan High School could turn things around. [Busan Jung Ang High School, Hwaiting!] [My son Heo Jae Yoon, Hwaiting!] I read it many times, I can't find it. Is it a secret? Jae Yoon. Hey Jae Yoon! Jung Ang High School! From now on, block the number 14 too! Cheon Ki-beom tries to break through again. As usual, Anyang High School blocked him. He looked around. Heo Jae-yoon was blocked. Bae Gyu-hyeok's position was vacant. Bae Gyu-hyeok, triple point shot. Enter! Because they also hindered Heo Jae-yoon, Bae Gyu-hyeok has a chance to score points. Cheon Ki-beom hatches a plan. Passes the ball to Bae Gyu-hyeok. Bae Gyu-hyeok looked at Jung Kang-ho. Jung Kang-ho, Hong Sun-gyu. Hong Sun-gyu broke through and shot. Very good! Jung Ang Busan High School turned things around thanks to Heo Jae-yoon's appearance. Excellent! Get ready. Kang-ho. Bae Gyu-hyeok broke through. He passed the ball to Jung Kang-ho. Jung Kang-ho... more points for Jung Ang! Jung Kang-ho's game is already very good. [Anyang High School 27 - 23 Jung Ang High School Busan] He is an extraordinary player. Jung Ang High School, cheers! Choi Seung-won passed the ball to Jung Chan-woo. Jung Chan-woo dribbled and then passed the ball to Kwon Jung-bin. Kwon Jung-bin will step forward. He failed to pass. Why not focus? Anyang High School is a bit worried because Heo Jae-yoon is playing very well. Jung Ang Busan High School is progressing fast. They kept on slaughtering Anyang High School. [Jung Ang is Great, Definitely Wins!] Kang-ho, Kang-ho. Lee Jong-su passed the ball. He broke through. Hong Sun-gyu blocked his shot. Jung Kang-ho passed the ball. Bae Gyu-hyeok took possession of the ball and passed it to Cheon Ki-beom. Cheon Ki-beom triple point shoot... The ball bounces and.... in! Masuuukkk!!! Finally, Jung Ang Busan High School really turned things around. Jung Ang Busan High School played amazingly. Their teamwork just got better. Come on! The match has ended. Jung Ang Busan High School made it to the finals and beat Anyang High School superbly. Jung Ang High School! Hooray!!!! Jung Ang Busan High School defeated Anyang High School, and created a miracle. Jung Ang High School! Yes... You guys have really worked hard. I really thank you. Tomorrow we can also play basketball, are you happy? YES!!! YES!!! We won!!! Are you sure you can compete tomorrow? It's not too late to tell Coach-nim now. Should I tell him? Even if you tell him, nothing will change. My whole body hurts. Aigooya... Kang-ho. What? What's next... we can still continue to play basketball? It seems like... our last game is just until we graduate from high school. Maybe Gyu-hyeok and Ki-beom can still play. But which university or professional team will take us? Correct. But we can still play tomorrow. Then we will become adults one day. [Yongsan High School Basketball Team] You're a player, why aren't you sleeping at this hour? My body feels very tired. But I can't fall asleep. [Yongsan High School! Let's win again this year!] [Busan Jung Ang High School! Onward to the Finals!] Aigoo, Sunbae-nim, you came too. Yes. - It turns out you guys didn't forget to come. - Yes. Thanks to you, Hwejang-nim, our basketball team made it to the finals. I'm not much help anything. It was because of the struggles of Kang Coach-nim and the kids. Correct. Please sit. Lots of people came. But how can we skip this? Hadeuh... Coy... Just be careful with 3 people. Who? Mr. Homeroom teacher, Mr. Principal, and Mr. Wakasek. Mr Wakasek. Means now it's enough to be wary of just two people. Foolish idiot... Why are you here at this hour? Mr Wakasek... Get out, get out. That's it sir, our player has appeared! Jung Ang High School! Cheer up! Hwaiting! [May 12, 2012, Final Round. Busan Jung Ang High School VS Yongsan High School] How are you doing, Sunbae-nim?

Yes. Don't forget that we are the best national team! Win! Win! Hwaiting! We have been through so many difficulties. Enjoy today. Without doubt. No regrets. Jung Ang High School! Hwaiting! Come on! The final match will start soon. Yongsan High School has the ball. As we expected, they started attacking quickly. Myo-won, Myo-won. Yongsan High School was moving fast. Pass the ball to Heo-hun. And immediately score points. The first point in the finals for Yongsan High School. - Pass! - Bae Gyu-hyeok has the ball. Bae Gyu-hyeok tries to shoot... But Yongsan High School blocked it. Han Jun-young blocked it with great accuracy. Han Jun-young kept going. Han Jun-young, lay-up. And another point for Yongsan High School. As expected, Han Jun-young from Yongsan High School dominated the area under the basketball hoop. Yes. Yongsan High School got off to a good start. Good! Even though the match had only been running for less than a minute. Yongsan High School had taken control of the atmosphere. Although it is still early in the game, it will be difficult for Jung Ang High School. Yes. Bae Gyu-hyeok passed the ball to Cheon Ki-beom. Cheon Ki-beom. Lay-up, shoot! Cheon Ki-beom! Enter!
