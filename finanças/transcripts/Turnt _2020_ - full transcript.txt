Flying the family out to Cali, first class, and shit. - Yeah, we was like celebrities or something. Back when things was good. - Yeah. Well, Kenny had just got the confirmation that he was supposed to perform on "Turnt." They set him up with some distribution deal. The first person he wanted to call and tell was Labareis. Called him all morning, but he never even picked up. - Wait. I didn't know that. That's probably why Labareis feels so responsible. God. - It's been really, really hard since then. You know how close me and Rilla was. I know he could be a asshole. He ain't a rapper and gangster.

So I thought it was a good idea that she talked to Rilla. But unfortunately, my backup plan didn't work. She just gave Des her acceptance letter from this big company out in London.

Faze, whose real name is Marcus Jackson, has been charged with the murder of up-and-coming rapper Kenny Stanford, who's known as That Deal. Kenny's death left the community torn and angry after he received the news. - Shit, the whole time I was thinking. - On the hit TV show "Turnt." His life was cut short due to senseless street violence, and remained unsolved until moments ago. - I need to go handle this. - When Marcus Jackson was apprehended for a disturbance here. - I can't go back to jail. - Police did find the murder weapon in his vehicle. - Shit. - Apparently, Jackson has been on a spiral after the fast living and money blowing has caught up with him. Sources tell us that he is so unmanageable that even his family and friends have stopped dealing with him. - The news described this dude that killed my brother. And I realized that I'm just like him. And I realize I'm the one who killed Kenny. I ain't no better than him. I probably did kill somebody's brother. I feel really bad with this kind of pain. Shit, all these hoes. Fuck that. Ladonna is beautiful and loyal. I'm gonna tighten up. Be with my wife forever. Always. Lord, before you call me home, let me make it right.
