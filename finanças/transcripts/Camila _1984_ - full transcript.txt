Camila, Camila! Look, Granny is coming! Granny is coming? Let's welcome her. Adolfo! Be good, children. She's coming. There are so many soldiers! Are they guarding her? Why would Perichona want to run away? Don't you call her Perichona! Everybody calls her that. She's your grandma, you must respect her, Camila. Why will she be locked up, mum? Is she a spy? What is a spy? ¢1986 GEA CINEMATOGRAFICA ¢2002 CINEMATECA CONDOR MEDIA Welcome, madam. I hope you enjoy your stay here... ...as much as possible. Enjoy it? I must spend the rest of my life... ...in this farm, are you kidding? You should be happy you're not in jail and thank... ...the government's generosity. I am your mother, Adolfo, don't forget it, please. I don't know you. You were born when I was in Janeiro, what's your name? Camila, Granny. Camila O'Gorman, sounds beautiful. Tell me, do you like love stories? I don't know. Newspapers! Buy your newspaper! Turn it upside down, nigger! Here, and hurry up, the master is waiting. Rita! Where is Miss Camila? Tell her the teacher is waiting. She's not in her room. - Have you seen Miss Camila, young master? - No. - The mistress asked for her. - Maybe she's avoiding her bath. - The English gave up. - Miss Camila? They understood Rosas won't give in. They had to lift the blockade. Is that good, master? Of course! Now we'll have good candles. Girls! You mustn't play with water! I'm so busy on bath days! Rita, is it true the governor takes a bath everyday? - Don't say such things! - Is it true or not? So they say. It seems the man is quite strange. He has a big house and a small house,... ...and all the water he wants. Camila, why are you always hiding? You shouldn't do that. Why not? If daddy learns about them he'll have them drowned. Look. IN MEMORY OF CAMILA O'GORMAN... ...AND LADISLAO GUTIERREZ FREE VERSION 1984 There's no cure for me. I've quarrelled again... ...with my dad, he's so arrogant. Sometimes I wish he was dead. And then I have nightmares. Last night I heard news, I didn't know where they came from. I dreamt I opened a door and I saw a man and a woman,... ...she was moaning, like a cat. Father,... ...I couldn't stop watching. I couldn't stop watching, I couldn't help it. I went nearer and watched. And when I saw that woman naked on the floor... ...it was me. I feel so ashamed, Father. You know dreams are born in your heart. - Father Felix! - I'm not Father Felix. I thought I was talking to my confessor. - Why didn't you stop me? - We both have the same job. I don't want you to confess me. Excuse me, Father. Who's the new priest? Water! Water! What have you got for me? - It's just arrived from Montevideo. - Thanks. - Bye. - Bye. - Hi, Tomas. - Hi, Camila. - Hello, Mrs. Hortensia. -Hello. - I'm taking one. -Fine. - Mariano? Mariano? - Yes? - How much is Miss Camila's book? - Eight. -Eight. - Don't tell me you're here to buy a book. - No. Then you're following me. Don't want you to be seen here. Give me that parcel. Give me that parcel. It's not gunpowder, it's just a book. Yes, but there are books and books. Let's go. - Ignacio! -I just want to protect you. That's all. Fine. Then walk with me home. Let's go. Carmen. Carmen, I'm going home with Ignacio. Alone? "There's nothing sadder for a man than emigrating,... ...leaving his country violently, involuntarily, or... without having thought about it. It's an agony no one can feel... ...if he hasn't experienced it. Emigration is death." When will you stop tormenting me? I'm reading for you but you haven't heard a word, right? No, I mean it. Marry me. Let's get on the coach! Let's go back! Camila! Camilita! Will you marry me, beautiful princess? Where am I? Where am I? Come here, come here! Come, come, come! Ignacio! You won't recognize him, he's just arrived. I bet you I will! He's not Father Felix. He's not Eduardo. Please... ...talk to me, say something. Happy birthday, Camila. I know, you are the new priest. Tea is ready! Camila, come, you must cut the cake. That's my father, come. Father, I'd like to introduce you to a friend,... ...Father Ladislao Gutiérrez. Yes, I've heard about you. - Father Ganon. - Nice to meet you. My uncle the governor sends you his best regards, sir. Excuse me. - The governor of Tucumán is your uncle? - Yes, sir. You'll always be welcome in this house, Father. You're a very lucky man, Father. In Mr. O'Gorman's parties you'll meet the cream... ...of Buenos Aires society. Thank you very much, sir. You'll have to take care of some details. I don't understand, father. You have forgotten your red ribbon, my friend. I've always got a spare one for these emergencies. The governor is a bit jealous on this point. Father Ganon is exaggerating. Do you think so? I'm sorry. - Here, Clara. - Rita, bring more orange juice. This cake is delicious. It is! My mother in law gave me the recipe... - Have some wine. -I'll give it to you if you want. Want some tea? This song is called "Cielito",... ...we sing it for those who have a hidden sorrow,... ...who are devils, not saints. Cielito, darling, yes,... ...cielito, darling, get ready,... ...we're going for a ride... ...on a light blue pony. In case he is listening,... ...he should take the hint. Anyway he can't refuse... ...he's already fallen in the trap. In case he is listening... He should take the hint. Anyway he can't refuse,... ...he's already fallen in the trap. Very good! "My lady, my dear,... ...I can hear the arms getting ready to shoot this heart. I want you to know it will be with you until its last beat." No, no, not that one. That is for me. I'll give you another one. "My passion, dear lady, does not know the limit of time. Every now and then I touch this cross... ...that still keeps the perfume of your body... ...that I madly love." Is it true he made love as in the novels? Yes. We stayed awake all night. The viceroy never forgets the pleasure of his beloved. Never. My body aches all over. But... go on, go on, love letters wither... ...if they are not read. "Her angel body vibrates in my arms... ...even when she is not there any more." Mon Dieu! It's time already, and I'm not dressed! Listen, listen,... ...the guests are here! Yes, madam, but remember the viceroy is always... ...the last one to arrive. - My hat! - Yes. - My hat. Is... is everything ready downstairs? - Yes. - Are the musicians here already? - Yes, madam. -Is the table ready? - Yes, madam. I put the French candelabrum as you ordered. And the jasmines too. Listen, Madam O'Gorman. They are playing a minuet. How many times do I have to say I don't like you... - ...to come up here? - I'm sorry. You know the lady is confined. Don't you? I do, but she's my grandmother. Obey and hurry up, we're coming back to... ...Buenos Aires before dark. You look beautiful, madam. Welcome Santiago de Liniers,... ...what are you waiting for? He'll arrive soon. Calm down, madam. Calm down. Nobody will arrive, they are all dead. Your Liniers was shot more than 30 years ago. My dear son,... ...go to bed, tomorrow mum will tell you about the party. Kiss me. Farewell, mother. I'll come back on Christmas. Take care. You know? I'll be so sad when you get married. Sometimes I think I'll never get married, Rita. Perhaps the man I imagine is a dream. Miss Camila, I can almost see you now,... ...entering the church in a white lace dress on the master's arm. Rita... - Long live the Holy Federation! - Long live! Again! As when we were kids. God, when will this end? What's up? - You can't get through. - What's going on? Let me... - You can't get through! - The priest is waiting for us. I'm bringing the papers for our wedding. My God! Who is he? Mariano. Horrible! - What harm can a bookseller do? - You never know. As Rosas says, "20 drops of blood spilled on time... ...save spilling 20,000." You can't leave him there please, father, do something. We can't touch him yet. Murderers! Murderers! Murderers! Murderers! So, dear brothers,... ...how can we prepare our hearts for this Christmas? Remembering its deep meaning... ...I must ask myself,... ...what happened the other night in God's house? Has Herod put John the Baptist's head on a plate again? Some have come to kill and destroy,... ...but He has come to give life. To give plenty of life. He said, "I am The Good Shepherd, and... ...The Good Shepherd gives life to his sheep,... ...and the Father wants to keep all of them,... ...even the lost ones. Why are we so sad today then? Because one of our brothers has been brutally killed. Now I tell you, as the Lord said,... ..."You do to me what you do to my smallest brother." It's time everybody knows a divided kingdom that fights... ...its own people won't last. Every divided house will be wasted. Brothers, don't be afraid,... ...this is God's word and no law can shut up His word. Let's pray together now. Blessed be the meek. Blessed be the meek. And those hungry and thirsty for justice will be satiated. That's because he's too young. What can he know about the anarchy of the 20's? Nothing. It's strange because his family is Federal. - His uncle is a governor. - He's a fool. He doesn't know who stopped the foreign attacks. Rosas. Who re-established law and order? Rosas. Who defends our sovereignty? Rosas. Only Rosas. Yes, at any cost. What did you say, Camila? Nothing. Nothing. It's okay, you may leave. Repeat what you said, Camila. Nothing justifies violence. Unitarians against Federals, and vice versa,... - ...always the same. - But they're not the same. I'm not so sure. What had poor Mariano done? - He sold books. -Eat your food, Camila. Be quiet and listen. I think Camila wants to defend her new confessor. I do. Is it wrong to defend someone who... ...has the courage of defending life? He's very brave. Camila, in this table nobody raises his voice. Go to your room. Buenos Aires is a violent city. He was protecting you. So I mustn't speak, right? No, you must be careful. That's what I meant. What's so funny? The way you find to tell me you don't disapprove of me. - That's what I did? - Yes. You order my thoughts, Father. Like a compass. I feel very well after I talk to you. That's what priests are for. I'm so glad I can talk to you about my sorrows. And about your sins. Yes, my sins. You're confessing your sins, don't forget that. I don't. I'll have to invent many sins. Your sermon, Father Gutierrez,... ...has been a very unpleasant surprise. You know our relationship with the government is difficult. Don't you know they are trying to expel the Jesuits for good? I'm very sorry, Monsignor. Indignation carried me away. You like it very much quoting from the Bible but,... ...you seem to have forgotten what Jesus told his disciples. "Since I'm sending you as sheep among wolves,... ...you must be as wise as the snake,... ...and as simple as a dove." Needless to say imprudence in a priest is twice as serious. In any field. I don't understand, Monsignor. Don't forget women can be instruments of the devil. Father Ladislao. Hello, Camila. I hadn't seen you. Father, I brought this for the people who may... ...need it more than I do. Do you think the poor need this frivolity? Put yourself in their place. Beggars don't wear rich people's clothes. You're humiliating me. I'm just trying to be better. A single woman is chaos, Camila. A disorder of nature. There're only two ways of dominating that anarchy. The convent,... ...or marriage. And I don't think you have a religious inclination. Marriage is order. Neither people nor a country can live without order. - I'm not in love with Ignacio. - Love comes with the years,... after living together, not after sharing glances in the garden. Your head is full of foreign books,... - ...but reality is not a French novel. - Sir,... - We won't receive anybody today. - Father Gutiérrez is here. Tell him to come in. - Good evening, sir. -What brings you here so late? I'd like to talk to Eduardo. Eduardo is at his cousins', maybe you even passed him by. A cup of cocoa, Father? No, no, thanks, Mrs. Joaquina, I'm leaving, then. Excuse me. Here, Camila, it was among the clothes you took to church. Keep it, father, maybe this will be useful for the poor. They'll be as grateful for this as they were for your dresses. Will they? I'm grateful too. Your words make me very happy. Good night. Where were we? You were saying marriage is like a country. And the best prison is that you can't see. I didn't say that. I just said women... - ...must get married. - It's the same. I haven't finished, Camila. You never thought of a woman? Yes. Sometimes. So? What would you do if you fell in love? - I'd mortify my flesh without respite. - What? Your body may turn against you. If I didn't find peace, I'd try to go away from the woman. I'd never see her again. - What if that didn't work? - It must work. Camila,... ...human love is limited,... ...only God's love is infinite. - What if he wants to stop being a priest? -He can't. He's married to God for life. - You can't answer me. - I've answered you. -You can't. - You refuse to understand. - No. Listen. "During the long summer days an insect... ...is born at 9 in the morning and dies at 5 in the afternoon. How can he understand the word night?" How can you understand... ...the word "love" if... ...you have never been in love? Come in. Father Felix. - I'd like to confess. - Why so late? Please. Camila! I'm engaged! Yes! I'm engaged! I'm engaged! José María has proposed to her. They'll get married! But he works for Rosas! I know he's not handsome, but he's refined. And so rich. I'm sorry, Clara, I didn't mean to be rude. - I hope you love him. -I'll marry him, of course I love him. That's what counts, to be deeply, deeply in love. Yes? I'll be so lonely with these two empty beds. Marry Ignacio. Hurry up or somebody will steal him from you. You're a fool, Camila, you'll lose the best... ...catch in Buenos Aires. I want something else, Clara. I want a different man. A man... ...I can feel... ...proud about. Yes. Yes, proud. A man I can... I want to go out and shout his name... ...in the street and say... ...this is my husband. Cry it out. It's two o clock. There's order in the city. Long live the Holy Federation. I'm a fool. Father Ladislao? Father Ladislao. Yes, my child. I'm listening, Camila, speak. I'm madly in love, father. That's not a sin. It's normal at your age. I love him with all my heart. I'd do anything for him. Now you should think of getting married, my child. He can't get married. And I'm not your child. Mind your words, Camila. Don't you see who am I talking about? You refuse to understand me. You're nut, go away. Please, Father. Camila, this is God's house. Please! - What's wrong, Rita? - Miss Camila,... ...your grandmother has died. God Almighty! She was so good! Wasn't Father Gutiérrez coming to say the prayer? No. He's ill, he's got a very high fever. Hail, Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women and blessed is the... ...fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us, sinners,... ...now and at the hour of our death. - Good morning, Father Felix. - Good morning, son. Ah, Ladislao,... somebody left this letter while you were celebrating Miss. When I hear the bells toll... ...I feel you're talking to me. I wanted to know this place. You're crazy, Camila. I am. What will I do with you? Do as you please. What will happen to us? If you love me I don't care. I can't have a secret love, Camila. Neither can I. - I can only give you scandal and shame. - I'm not scared. Please, go. Whatever you say. It's me again. I needed to hear your voice. My Camila,... ...I'm crazy, I can't stop thinking of you. I dream of you day and night. I can't sleep. Camila, I love you. I'd spend my life kneeling before you. Won't you take a nap, Camila? I brought you something, mum. What? A present. So that you won't forget me. Love me dearly, mum. Love me dearly. Finally you decided to come. Here, Genaro. Let's have a cold drink. You must be thirsty. - Father, I must tell you something. - Go ahead. Father... What is it, son? Why don't you tell me? Camila is gone. What are you saying? What the fuck are you saying? Camila is gone. - We looked for them everywhere. - For them? Who did you look for? Camila and Father Ladislao. They run away together. Not even a bird stirs in the Pampas without... ...the governor knowing it. And scandal happens right here, before our own noses. Write. His Grace the Governor,... ...we beg you to order... ...the police chief... ...to dispatch an order to search the city... ...as well as the countryside... ...to apprehend and bring these two miserable,... ...unfortunate, wretched people,... ...in any place of the territory... ...where they are found. ...to inform... ...you... ...about... ...the most... ...horrible deed... ...ever... ...heard of... ...in the... - ...country. - Please, Adolfo,... ...we should listen to Camila before condemning her. Destroy that letter, I beg you. What are you saying? She's romping like a whore with... ...a sacrilegious man and you want me to listen to her. First my mother,... - ...now her. -She's your daughter, father. Be merciful. Now I can't be merciful! What a shame, poor mother. It will only be a burden and bring discredit to the Church,... ...to the state and to the priesthood... ..if such an outrage were not punished... ...with the exemplary justice that is suitable... ...to satisfy religion... ...and the laws. And to avoid,... ...with a healthy uprightness,... ...the consequent demoralization,... ...licentiousness... ...and disorder. Signed,... ...Brigadier-General Juan Manuel de Rosas,... ...governor and field marshal of the province of Buenos Aires. I was born in Jujuy, my father is Clemente de Salas,... - ...my mother, Josefa Gómez. - Where did you get married? I got married in Saint Joseph Church in La Rioja,... ...on May 2nd, 1846. Where did we go on honeymoon? Nowhere, we are poor. - Let's invent something, it's free. - You choose it. Rome. Yes! To ask the Pope to allow you to marry me. It would be nice, right? Camila... Valentina. Valentina. Happy wife of Máximo Brandie. Really happy? Yes! Sometimes I feel like crying. I wish we were old and we could remember and tell this. Are you so afraid? Very. You weren't born to hide. You were born to love. To love you. - The... - Sun! Very good! Very good. - And this is the... - Banana. - It's a banana. - No! It's the moon. M-O-O-N. It comes out at night when the sun goes away. - Go home now. - Yes! Be careful, give me your notebooks and boards. - See you tomorrow. - I'll see you tomorrow. - Good morning, chief. - Hi. -Good morning. - Always working? - Yes. - Always. My wife sends you this jar of jam. - Thanks. - You're always so good to us. Well, life in Corrientes is hard. Even for lovers. - Why don't you come in and have some tea? - No. I'm in a hurry today. Maybe some other day. I'll see you on Easter Sunday,... ...I'll be waiting for you at home. We're very few in... ...Goya, we should get together. - We'll be there, chief. - Very well. - I'll see you on Sunday. - Bye. And thanks. It's getting cold, isn't it? Yes, summer is over. - You can't sleep? - No. I need to be alone. Please. I need you to be with me. Haven't I done enough to be with you? You regret it. - Camila, please. - Answer me. - I was praying. - Answer me. - Leave me alone! If I had your son, that would mean... ...God isn't angry with us, right? Yes, my darling. Yes. If He were angry He'd be wrong. That was a blasphemy, right? I don't know. I don't know. I'd like to do something. - To confess with you. - Quiet. Confess... ...that when I see you praying... ...I am jealous. Camila, if I listen to you I won't know who I am. My husband. Máximo Brandie. Know what, Mr. Brandie? What, madam? I'm proud of being your wife. Know what, Mrs. Brandie? I love you. - Good evening. - Good evening, chief. WANTED. PRIEST LADISLAO GUTIERREZ. CAMILA O'GORMAN Thanks. - A drink, gentlemen? - Thank you. - Go to the kitchen. - Go ahead, obey your mum! - Gentlemen. - Thank you! How are you, judge? Excuse me. Mr. Brandie, if you allow me and if I'm not too drunk,... ...I'd like to make a toast to your lovely wife. Besides, I'd like to thank you... ...for being our children's first teachers. The city of Goya will never forget that. - Thank you, judge. - Cheers. -Cheers. Valentina,... ...I'm taking your husband away. It won't take too long. It's men's business. Come on, Black! - He wants to hit him with that long claw. - That's the spur. They attack each other's eyes, look. See how they fight? Great! That's the favorite. His father has never lost a fight. See how he stands up? He's brave! How are you, Father Gutiérrez? - What did you say? - Don't you remember me,... ...Father Ladislao Gutierrez? You're mistaken. God's hand reaches every corner. How far did you think you could go? He never forgets those He has chosen. It's not by chance that I am here,... ...in this lost village. This song is called "cielito",... ...we sing it for those who have a hidden sorrow,... ...for those who are devils, not saints. Cielito, darling, yes,... ...cielito, darling, get ready,... ...we're going for a ride on a light blue pony. In case he's listening he should take the hint. Anyway he can't refuse, he's fallen in the trap. Why don't you let me live in peace? What's wrong? Where's my husband? Father Gutiérrez has been discovered. I'm sorry, madam. I don't know what you mean. A priest recognized him. I still don't understand, where's Máximo? Camila! Please,... ...where is he? He went towards the river. Outside your house... ...there are two horses, and food. Brazil is not far away. Hurry up. Dawn is near. Then, I'll have to do my job. Thank you. I'll always be Gutiérrez. Forgive me. I wanted it this way. I don't regret it. Neither do I. But I can't fight him. I can't fight him. In the name of the government,... ...Ladislao Gutiérrez and Camila O'Gorman are arrested. What have you said? No! Don't touch her! Don't touch her! Let her go! She hasn't done anything! She hasn't done anything! Let her go! - Ladislao! - Let her go! "Morals have been so horribly corrupted... ...under the tyranny of this Argentine Caligula... ...that the impious and sacrilegious priests... ...from Buenos Aires run away with society girls... ...and the impious satrap does not take any step to... ...stop these monstrous immoralities." "El Mercurio" Santiago de Chile. What do you think now? What should Rosas do? Prove them right? She's just a girl. Not any more, not any more. Look,... ...this comes from Montevideo. "Is there on Earth a punishment harsh enough... ...for a man that so behaves with a woman whose dishonor... ...can not repair by marrying her?" Valentín Alsina. Are there laws that deal with this case? That's the issue. Do you think Sarmiento and Alsina care about laws? They don't want a trial, they want punishment. Have you heard them asking for a trial? Forgive me, Monsignor Elortondo. But I don't think the Church is so naive. I forgive you, Dr. Velez. But the governor wants your legal advice. Very well,.. ...there's no problem at all. According to compilations and registers,... ...this case constitutes the crime of sacrilege. And it's punished with death. Would it be wise to invoke the Indies Law when..... ...sacrilege is not punished with death penalty even in Spain? The only wise thing is to shut up those dirty Unitarians. Would you like to add anything to defend your... ...future sister in law? She won't be my sister in law. I'll cancel the wedding. Master... Camila is in Santos Lugares jail. - How do you know? - My father told me. Mr. O'Gorman, please intercede on her behalf. No one leaves that jail alive. - My God! -I entrusted you with my daughter,... ...and you were not man enough to take care of her. Real men are merciful. She betrayed me, she doesn't deserve to be forgiven. If Camila comes back she'll repent of her sins. I beg you, Adolfo. - Please, daddy... - Stop moaning! She won't repent, I know it. It's in her blood. She takes after my mother. Adolfo O'Gorman, hear this,... ...I curse the day I met you. You're not worried about your daughter but about your name. You're sick with pride. All of you are sick,... ...with violence, with blood. Has anyone raised his voice to save my daughter? Nobody. Nobody thinks of her. The Church thinks of her reputation,... ...you think of your honor,... ...Rosas thinks of his power. Unitarians want to use this to overthrow him. Who thinks of my daughter? You're going to shoot me. What about Camila? Forget her, think about you. I'm asking you this favor to die in peace. Camila will die too. I have to talk to her. You are the boss here. I'm not the boss, father. I just carry out my orders. I beg you, captain. Don't insist. Don't insist. Are you going to shoot us without a trial,... ...without giving us the chance to defend ourselves? That's out of my reach. You told me they were sending me to a convent. For some reason the governor changed his mind. You can't kill us like that. Bring the doctor, quickly. Nothing is wrong with you, you're pregnant. God help you. Ladislao! We're going to have a baby! We're going to have a baby! Ladislao! We're going to have a baby! We saved her, Mariano! - We saved her! - How? It's illegal to kill a pregnant woman. Sit down, Dr. - Long live the Holy Federation! - Long live! Come in. - Long live the Holy Federation. - Long live. What's up? I bring a message from the governor. How long? Four hours. Camila... ...will die at the same time? Yes. I need to write a few lines. Please. My Camila,... ...I've just learned you're dying with me. Since we couldn't live together on Earth,... ...we'll be joined in Heaven before God. Your Gutiérrez holds you. Courage, my child. God wants you to be with Him. Please, Father, do something, I beg you! Confess your sins, my child. You must be ready to face the supreme moment. Don't you understand? There's life inside me. Save it, I beg you in God's name! Think of the other life. I'm thinking of this one! Drink it, my child. This holy water will take the innocent body to the Lord. Be brave... ...son. Attention, soldiers! March! Attention, squad! Line up! Attention, squad! Present arms! Ladislao, are you there? By your side, Camila. Prepare arms! Aim! Fire! Ladislao! Ladislao... Attention, squad! Load arms! Prepare arms! Aim! Fire! Fire! I said fire! Fire! Ladislao? Are you there? By your side, Camila.
