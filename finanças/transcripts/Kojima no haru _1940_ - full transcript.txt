A Daiei Film Spring on a Small Island A Kazuno Shigemune production Script by Yasutaro Yagi from an original story by Masako Ogawa Cinematography by Kinya Ogura Directed by Shiro Toyoda Music by Shuuichi Tsugawa, Art direction by Makoto Sono Assistant director: Jun Haruyama Cast Shizue Natsukawa as Koyama-sensei Ichiro Sugai as Hirokawa Haruko Sugimura as his wife Misako Shimizu as Toshi Shiro Mizutano as Kenzo Spring tides bring to the small island of the Inland Sea (Seto-naikai) such abundant peach blossom... Up on the hill on those small islands where the peach flowers bloom is where I thought happiness dwells. Mum! Teacher said I need to wear long pants to school! I need to wear long pants (saru-mata) to school! What did you say? Can you take out my pants? Hi! Pants! Long pants What is it? - I need my long pants for school. A doctor's coming! - They're on the line. These aren't mine! They're my brother's! Yours have got a hole in! Eugh! It's no embarrassment! They're pure cotton! Cotton? High class! Not even the Mayor wears those! Sensei wears them though! Sis, do I look funny? NO! Why? Go on! Off you go! - OK! Don't get them dirty! I washed them for dad! OK. I've never seen you in long pants! They're girlie pants! - Aren't! Aren't! - Are! Yeah? - No? Are! - Isn't! Today's health inspection will be different from the last one. Toshi's dad is here as well. Today's is the Leprosy check! Really? - Yes, my dad said so. OK. Let's go see. What's leprosy? - Don't you know? Like Kenzo's dad! Oh! So that's called leprosy, is it? My dad is... I don't want to know! Who cares! Nor me! Year 2 boys, get ready! Get undressed and just go in your pants. Take off your pants and go in. Turn to let the doctor have a look at you Take your pants off. Come in! Saburo Yamashita. You're Saburo Yamashita? So that doesn't hurt? Someone with the illness lives nearby to this kid. You share a bath with neighbours, don't you? - Yes. OK Finished. Hang on! You've forgotten something important! Kenzo Yokogawa. So you're Kenzo Yokogawa... Now this one. This kid's father has it. Let's have a look at your neck. And here... And now... OK... Next... Let's see your legs. OK Now turn around... What are you best at in school? Reading? Maths? Your drawings are really really good. Even the Mayor knows! Are you going to be an artist when you grow up? Is it your brother who's been in main school for 6 years? What does you father do? Sometimes in the field, sometimes at home. Because his brother is in the big school. The parents of kids in the same class protest. Does it hurt? Doesn't it hurt? Ouch! Good! OK. All done! How is he? There appears to be no abnormality now. But caution is needed. Let's hope he stays like this. Yes indeed! Next! Yokogawa Kenza! Why so loud! A child I know to be a leprosy patient's stands before me, averting his eyes and Let's go! Doctor's coming! Let's go to the lighthouse! Let's go to the lighthouse! That sickness is catching! I'm not happy! I wonder. He's been suffering since before he was 40... He's got all religious but it's done no good! I see! So it's in the blood then! Go away. Get away! What's my illness called? It's infectious so you can't go wandering around. What did she say? - Sorry he's really deaf. Your illness is a nasty one. You must be careful so as not to spread it to others. I eats lots of fish so I thought I couldn't catch it (folk belief about leprosy) How embarrassing that he believes something like that! She's going to Kenzo's house next! They're going to the Yokogawa family! Hey!! Hello! Hello! I found one! Really? Where? There's a big one! Hello? Hello? Stop peeking. Stay back. Get away! OK! The prefectural government's new policy for pitiful sufferers like you... To ask you to go to the Aiseien hospital on Nagashima. The doctor from Nagashima has come to accompany you. You can go with her and be looked after. Well? Why not? How about the other sufferers? The other people will also be looked after. But you're in the worst condition and it needs to be dealt with. The other sufferers have more social status and money compared to us. I've got lots of children. And I... - Yes? Having lots of kids is exactly why you cannot stay. If the children catch it they will suffer just like you. We really need you to think about it and to understand. Mother! No! If you take him away I... No! I can't bear it! I can't let him go! Kenzo? The doctor's at Kenzo's house! Oh! The monk said they'll take his dad and his mum started crying! It's a filthy disease! I've heard they take them there and give them a lethal injection. Really? The government wouldn't lie about that sort of thing, would they? - Well no... Hello and thanks for your work. So, to sum up what I've said... Firstly, leprosy is not genetic. It's a chronic infectious disease. Secondly, the sanatorium is the best place for treating it. And thirdly, I'd like other people to have sympathy with the sufferers. I'm sorry if my poor explanation may have been difficult to understand. Please ask me to clarify anything you are unsure about. The reason we've gathered all you officials here tonight... Was to hear Dr Koyama's explanation. And to convey it to the people in the village! Please don't hesitate to ask questions. And then you need to tell the villagers. I'd just like to ask.... What is this 'bacillus' like? You can sit down now! Let's go to the begining of the document. Under the microscope it resembles the TB bacillus. Rather stiff, like pine needles The bacteria was first discovered in 1883. By a Norwegian called Hansen. It cannot be passed to animals. What kind of proof is there about infection? Well, the main thing is the discovery of the bacillus itself. Otherwise... There was a large project in the Philippines. They did research on children of sufferers who were brought up by their mothers... 48% of them contracted the illness. Whereas for children brought up away from their mothers only 10% developed symptoms. And amongst those 10%... some had spent more than 6 months with their mothers... And there is a theory that it can be transmitted in the womb. At any rate scientists are now certain that it is an infectious illness. So even if you live in the same house some people will get ill and others will not? Depending on the individual some people have resistance. Like some trees will burn and others not. Children have less resistance than adults so it's a danger to them. It's really bad if the children were to catch it! So, how many people in Japan have this? Yes, how many people are there? According to a police survey in 1936... 15,000 people on the home islands. But following the local examinations and looking at the data... Probably between 20,000 and 30,000. Globally it's most common in India and China. Maybe 1 million in total. Japanese has the most in any civilised country. The fewest are in Germany and the UK, only around 20. I'm just from a small rural place. I hear there's no cure. Is it really incurable? Everyone always asks that. As with cancer, if you start treating it quickly... It's not incurable. With a year or two of treatment in the Leprosarium many patients are transformed beyond recognition. It's hard to say this but... What is it? The islanders believe they will killed soon after entering the hospital. Is it true? Idiot! What rubbish! The doctor has just carefully explained to us. What's this talk of killing? How dare you! I know what a hospital is! But what the villagers are saying in the shadows... I need to tell them and reassure them. Why are you on about this now? Idiot! Idiot? You're an idiot! Luckily for us, the doctor has come from high up (status o-kami) She's kindly explained everything to us... You don't look after the villagers' health... You say you're the leaders but you haven't done anything for us! You're thieves! - What! Who dare you! What will you do about it? Each hamlet on this island has complex relations... That's why there was such uproar... It must be tough! Even this point that it's purifying the village or for the sake of the sick... There are loads of people who just cannot accept it! Thank you for all your hard work. - Thank you. The Doctor will be leaving now. Goodbye! - Good night. Good night! - Good night! That was a long meeting! Aren't you tired? - No. Thank you! Oh? Me too! Thank you so much for letting me stay tonight. - Stop it! Is that light the next island? Yes, that's right. I hear their are people sick there. Do you know? On Shirashima? The ferry captain told me on the trip over. He said something about in the peach orchard. I've heard something like that... Must have been around 10 years ago. - I wonder if there is someone there. Actually, I was asking you! Oh yes, of course! Do you know where the peach orchard is? I don't. But I'll ask. It's OK, I'll ask when I'm over there. - Really? I almost forgot. Some people from the village want to see you. Please show them in. - Very well. Yes please. Excuse me! Yes? Excuse me! - Come in! Sorry to bother you after work. Thank you so much for doing the check up today. I was persuaded by your words to entrust my son to your hospital. That's fine. There is no need to thank me so much. I came to thank you. My wife is really worried. My son often complains of belly pains. Yes, his belly. Ah, you mean his tummy? If the hospital is looking after him what will happen when... There's no need to worry about that. The hospital has doctors not just for that illness.... They do surgery and have an ear-nose-throat department. Please pass that message along. - I will. Thank you. Did you know the Mayor is taking the father of the most seriously ill patient to Nagashima tomorrow? No, I'd not heard. Oh, that's odd. The Mayor wanted to get the patient's families to see the hospital... He said it was the best way to help them feel relaxed about going to the hospital. Would it be OK for me to have a look too? Certainly. The Hospital director would be delighted. I will go and see the Mayor immediately! Please do. Please talk with him. Goodnight, doctor. - Goodbye. Is anyone there? Please come up. Excuse me... How should I put this... when are leaving for Nagashima? I plan to visit patients on Shirashima tomorrow and then go to Tosa. Then I plan to drop back in here and take people back to the hospital with me. Tosa... why are you going to Tosa? I want to visit the families of some patients who are in the hospital. Especially the wives. And there's one particular child that's left there. My patient is always worrying about her... and whether or not she's become sick. He doesn't want his child to catch it. All he can think about is whether or not she's OK. I can understand that. I'm sorry to have troubled you. Did you want something? No, it's fine. Good night! Flowers of cherry blossom fall, as I huddle over the brazier on a cold wet day on the lonely island Excuse me for coming so suddenly. I work at the hospital at Okayama. I was visiting a neighboring island and heard about you. This isn't somewhere you can come! I'm very sorry to have startled you. My hospital is for those like you who are tragically afflicted. I thought perhaps it would be good for you to come. Go away! Go away! Go back where you came from. This is my house. This is my home. You must be lonely. I'm not at all lonely. But, rather than being here alone wouldn't it be more fun to live with lots of people? It's fine. I can enjoy being here. There are 1200 patients like you at the Nagashima hospital. We've created a village where they live. If you go it's really relaxed. There are plays, and there's cinema. Everyone is receiving treatment but able to still be active. And there's a radio. Come on, let's go. I've given up hope about what happens to me. Never mind me! Please leave. Go away. We don't have enough money for hospital. You don't need to pay. You don't need anything. You just need to come. I don't even have pocket money... If you come to the hospital I will visit your family and talk to them. Let's go. It will be so much better than being here alone. Oh, Doctor! Let's go. You mustn't see my face! Don't bother about me. I don't think there's any point. Even if I went... it's hopeless. Nobody... has ever been so kind to me... Isn't it cruel to leave a sick person alone like that? It's shameful for her to be seen! She's your beloved child, isn't she? For the sake of your daughter and for other people. And for the world in general. It would be best if she came to the hospital. We're not causing the world at large any trouble. We have the strength to manage and don't need to get her looked after by the hospital. People laugh at us living here but I have no desire to trouble the world. But, don't you feel sorry for her, all alone? That hideous disease is just bad luck. If she goes she'll be exposed in her shame. She'll be happier living by herself, hidden. Please leave. The island hospital is for all the unhappy sufferers. Everyone is sympathetic. Nobody wants to laugh. To be afflicted with this illness and to be living alone... Rather than shut up alone in that hut she should be in the sanatorium, at ease. She'd have a happy life, wouldn't she? Please read this carefully. Please think about getting her to come quickly. I'll come again. And I'll ask then. (Girl's Day display = around 3rd March) Oh my beloved, the leper girl atop the cliff on the isolated island has Hina-matsuri alone (Girl's Day festival but also a day for thinking of marriage and couples) Standing on the bridge over the Yoshino river at Awaikeda I look up at Chozouji temple and hear pilgrim-bells. Turn right for the pilgrimage route Is anybody here? Hello! Can I have a manju cake? Is your mother out? Is she out in the fields? And you're looking after the house? Clever girl! You're Kiyoko, aren't you? Do you remember me? No, well I remember you! So then... I brought you something... Put out your hand! What a grubby hand! Let's clean it shall we? That's better, isn't it! That's better, isn't it! Clever girl! Let me look? OK? You're face is very pretty. Let me pick you up! That's right! Clever girl! Do you always stay looking after the house? Will you be starting school next year? Do you like school? I see! Clever girl. Kiyoko, let me look at your tum-tum. I want to see if the bad insect is there! Take this off! You can't go to school with a nasty insect, can you? You're not cold, are you? What a pretty tum-tum you have! I wonder if it's here... I wonder... (the girl wears an o-mamori charm to prevent bad luck) Thank goodness! You're a clever girl and so there's no sign of those bad bugs! That's a good thing. Put your arms in! Your mother and father will be pleased there's no sign of it. I'm pleased too. I'm really happy. It was really worth coming! Sit down. I'll comb your hair. Oh! The cherries are in bloom! I hadn't noticed!!! I was so preoccupied! They're such beautiful flowers. Your hair's really pretty now. You mother will be surprised when she gets home. Just a moment... Well? When your mum comes home give her this. I'll just put it in here. OK. Understand? As a present for your father let's take a couple of photos of you. Put these down a minute... Smile for me. That's it! Let's go over by the cherry trees. Come on. OK. I'll take it here. Under the tree is good. Stand there for me. OK? Ready? Here we go... And... OK. Now one facing this way... that's it. OK. Ready?... Here we go. OK. And one last one. Now turn towards me! Smile! Good girl! Good. Clever girl! Watch your footing! I'm a bit busy so I will say goodbye. OK? Give my regards to your mother when she comes back. You stay and be a good girl. I'll say goodbye. Goodbye! Goodbye! Bye bye! Good bye, lady! Bye bye! Bye bye, lady! Bye! Bye bye, lady! Bye! Bye bye, lady! Bye! Bye bye, lady! Goodbye! Goodbye! Bye bye, lady! Bye-bye! Aren't you the doctor from Nagashima? Yes, my name is Koyama. Thanks for your help last time I was here. Thank YOU! It's good of you to take the trouble to come all the way out here. I just happened to be on the neighboring island and wanted to see how the patient's child was getting on... Oh I see... How is she? Has she started to get sick? There's no sign of it at the moment. But we'll have to be keep an eye on her for a while. I see. When I was here before I heard something. Yes? About a relative of the big land owner... Those discussions are above my level. I don't know for certain, but there are rumours he has a daughter who has that illness. She quit school part way through. But they claim it's another illness altogether. She's a relative of the big landowner... we can't say much... I'm not sure you'd be able to do the check up even if you visit them. Well, I'd like to visit them. How do I get there? Well, I don't know whether they'll let you meet her. We were turned away at the door last time. Yes, I heard about that. The house is in the village just over the mountain. You'll know it straight away. It's the oldest house in the village, anyone will know it. Please come in. Sorry to come unannounced but I am.... Dr Masako Koyama, National Leprosy Research Centre, Okayama University, Aiseien, Nagashima I knew I wouldn't be able to hide it for ever... This family has been in this house for 35 generations. Now, in my days has come this illness. Towards my ancestors and relatives... And towards the world at large... I am ashamed. I have hidden it as much as it can be hidden. Since the child became ill... We have hired no servants and the three of us... have been living as if walking on thin ice... We have tried to cure it. First thing in the morning and last thing at night... Even in my dreams it is all I think about. My wife fasted... and visited shrines to pray. If it can be cured, even if it costs everything we have... I have looked at the adverts in newspapers and magazines... And given her various medicines.... But none of them have had any effect. I know non-prescription drugs don't work, I know I was being cheated... Even knowing I'd been deceived.... I couldn't help but buy and try any kind of medication. I've even been to Tokyo... Not just once but twice, trying to buy medicine. My wife and I, not going to bed... so many times I've lost count.... It must have been so hard for you. If this is the situation... I will contact the hospital director to send someone to collect her in absolute secrecy. I am most grateful. At any rate I'd like to see her. Yes. Please take the doctor through to her. It seems she's getting much worse. Please wait a moment. This way. Rain all day, nobody visits. At sunset the roosting sparrows sing unceasingly. How are you? - Well... Kaijin' AKASHI poems, aren't they? - Yes. (1901-1939 poet and leprosy sufferer) There are lots of poems by people from the island in this one. Mum, will you read them to me? How old were you when you became ill? I was 17. It was that Spring. Shortly after my hand stopped being able to grip a racket I realised I had leprosy. I decided to kill myself and, as I got up to quietly slip away, I found my mother standing outside the shouji (sliding paper screen door). He used to live for his poetry. (Kaijin died in 1939)! He put his whole life into his verse. He started writing poetry after he came to Nagashima. I believe his poetic hometown is there... There in Nagashima. I had to change the name my parents gave me to come and live in this island hospital. I have an incurable illness. Today again a yellow, oily injection into my flesh. I am blind from leprosy and cannot raise them with my own hands Yet I still enjoy the tomatoes growing in the garden This young life which contains my blood As my child grows my fear increases! In the calm of the evening tide's turn I think of wife and child And lament the day my bones will be returned home to my family Hey! Wait! Thank you for coming. - Thank you for meeting me. Hello Doctor. It must have been a tough trip. Ah, hello! Hello! Have you come to get the bags? Thank you very much. Let's do Janken! to decide who carries. Let's do Janken Jan, ken, pon! I won! Jan ken pon Huh! Hey! We change after 100 steps! OK! 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,....11... Wait! Kenzo's got leprosy! He can't carry the doctor's bags, can he? Yes, yes. That's right. He's a leper! I'm not! The Doctor said I'm not, didn't she? I'm not! - The doctor only said that because you cry, wimp! That's what I heard the doctor say when she was at my house! Counting 12, 13, 14,... Hey, Sanchan... Can I just join in the counting though? I suppose I can bear it if it's just the counting! I'm happy just to count! 60, 61, 62,... I'm troubled. Yokogawa has still not agreed to come with us! I see. That's not good. I've explained the hospital to him in great detail... He's still making excuses! Whatever he says he's really just a coward. He doesn't want to be away from his wife. 82, 83... Here we are! 99! 100! Done it! Out of the way! Has the doctor not come back? She's gone to the Tokugawa house again. And she said she was going to your place! Shall we go and see? - Yeah! Sanpei! You mustn't go! What's going on? Where is he? Which field? Up the mountain. - Up the mountain? Where? Well... it's a long way... Never mind. Where is it? Ken! Can you take them to the bog field. You can get there, can't you? You're a clever boy so please take us. You want your dad's sickness to get better, don't you? So? Clever lad! Dad! Dad! Mum! Well, what's going on? Come on... you need to be going to the hospital tomorrow! It's an auspicious day on the horoscope and the doctor has come specially to take you. So come on, how about it? This is good wheat. You'll have a good harvest this year. Let's go together! I'm going to get looked after there! The Umedas and your dad have been with the Mayor... I've been and looked at the hospital. There's nothing to worry about. So let's go. It's a superb place. I've never seen anything like it before. If you get sick there are loads of doctors! Think about it from that point of view... When someone on this island gets sick there isn't even a single doctor! By the time the doctor gets here from Aokijima... some people get fed up with waiting and recover! Compared to this island... the difference is like that between heaven and hell! Patients feel better in such a nice place! There are some people who lose their eyebrows or whose hands warp... But that's the illness. You may not completely trust me but come. Quite so! Even if you think it's too good to be true, just try it. Let's go! Come on! Thanks for your concern... I shall come with you! Good! That's for the best! Everybody thinks it's the right thing! - That's right! Early tomorrow, quite early. Be at the quay by 7. We'll bring the ferry to collect you. - Ma'am! You make sure he comes! Goodbye! See you tomorrow! I will be waiting for you. I'm relying on you. Goodbye! Are they not here yet? He said yesterday he would and then this morning said he wouldn't! If he's not going he should have said so at the beginning! What will happen? - The Mayor is angry and has gone to fetch him! The Mayor had assured the doctor he would come! You're brave to decide to go! I can't really not... in the circumstances Yeah, yeah. Where are you going? - I'm going to take a look... I wouldn't... Why? Why aren't you coming? I told you all the details and I begged you. You're insulting me, the Mayor! Why won't you go? Not this time! I will go next time! It's not a bad place! I know that! But... there's so much work left to do... I need to finish up and then go. Please let me off today! The Mayor came to get him! The Mayor? I see! I keep telling you... what happens after you go to the hospital. The village will support you! Even when I'm not the Mayor any more I will ask my successor! Think about it! You, alone... when your kids get sick one after another... you'll have to be looked after and trouble others... The doctor said you're the most serious case. You need to get treated I know it. But please not today! Why can't you go? - Please let me! Why can't you? - Please! I beg you! How many times do I have to persuade you? Staying here in that failing body... When the police come to take you... I don't like to think of that so... I'm humbly begging you... OK? Don't you realise that? Don't you? Then I must entrust myself to you. No! Dad! Mum? What is it? Dad's going. Gather the family, quickly! Thank you, doctor! Please cure him and send him home quickly. I'll do my best. - Please. Look after the children! He's come! He's here! It's just a tiny something. Take care! Bye bye! From now on, anyone who bullies you... I'll beat them up! We can even beat the big kids! Hurry up and get better! - Thank you! Thank you for everything. Look after him for me! Take care! Look after your health! Don't worry about us! Take care! Be careful! Where are the girls? Will they'll make it? The boat's leaving! Dad! Dad! Take care of yourself!! Dad! Get well soon! - Dad! Dad's leaving! Where's Kenzo? Kenzo! Kenzo! Stupid Mayor! Baldy Mayor! The End Subtitles by: Czechnewwave
