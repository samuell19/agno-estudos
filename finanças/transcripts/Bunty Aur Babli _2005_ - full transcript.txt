It's not going to come. - It will It won't. - It will Boy, go down to the tap and have your bath Or you'll be standing at the end of a very long line No dearth of people wanting to get into a line What do you mean? - What I mean Ma is.. this world has two kinds of people, one, those who line up before taps.. and two, those who make themselves.. ..taps so they won't need to stand in any line I happen to belong to the latter. - You don't belong anywhere You've already spent forty rupees on this gibberish How much more will you blow up? - Ma, how many times do I tell you.. I'm not spending anything. This is an investment For fifty bucks, this shower is up and running.. then l'll fix it.. ..to the community tap and everyone's willing to part with fifty paise.. ..to bathe in a shower. If five people use it everyday, that's 2.50 In twenty days, fifty bucks are back That's 2.50 in profits everyday from each shower Stop. You're making my head spin The problem with this Fursatganj, talking sense sends heads spinning Anyway, do you remember my chit fund idea? A finance company in Lucknow.. - I don't want to know anything! If you don't stop now you'll surely go to jail some day There.. l told you it'll come Of course it will. Why won't it? How else will he drown his future? Why.. oh today was your interview for the railway job! You didn't go? I went! Pandey'ji called to say that.. before I recommend my son for another interview.. ..I should at least make sure that he drags himself there on his own two legs I've lain my' five years in the service on the line.. ..and made him agree for another chance tomorrow Thank God he agreed How does that matter? I need to agree too Rakesh, we're trying to be serious here I told him I don't want to be a ticket collector So what do you want to be? The maker of failed schemes, for life? All of Fursatganj thinks you're a deluded Don Quixote You want them to coin new euphemisms for you? Everyone.. Fursatganj is packed with asses. And all asses can do is.. ..chew the cud and bear the burden. I wasn't born to do either Oh you'll become a Birla-Tata-Ambani? - Why can't l be? They didn't fall out of the sky. They too were born here on this earth At least they were born here. You belong to a different planet altogether! Dad, don't get me started again. I've made up my mind I'm not going to waste my entire life trapped in a job Look here I've spent thirty five years in this job.. ..You think my life's been a total waste? After a lifetime of service, does the government even bother.. about your opinion? After thirty five years of.. shuttling up and down that same train route, does even one passenger.. from all those thousand trips remember.. ..what you look like in your shabby coat? When you die, will anybody except Ma and I, shed a single tear? Will the railways take a day off? Dad your life means nothing. There's no respect, no fun, no meaning When I walk wearing this shabby coat, that seems to embarrass you so much.. ..people stop in their tracks to pay me their respects Shopkeepers are up on their feet to attend to Mr. Ticket Collector Why? Because my poor black cotton coat.. is untainted by ill-gotten gain it is the mark of my esteem Rakesh.. the interview is at 9 o'clock tomorrow morning Get there in time. Or get lost Find a meaning for your life wherever you want, however you want to Because we can't live up to your high expectations.. we're sorry There's something about you baby You too You're not half bad either Go easy on the lipstick.. it shouldn't look too tacky. And one thing you ought to know A ragged skirt doesn't make you sexy It's what's in your eyes.. like in mine. Dear God.. my daughter has gone insane! - If worshipping my beauty.. ..is tantamount to being insane, then I plead insanity If craving for fame is insane then I plead insanity If the desire to renounce this pigeon-hole Pankinagar.. ..for the great wide marvellous world outside is insane.. then I plead complete insanity And you are driving me nuts. Take off that shirt I'm sorry, I don't believe beauty needs cheap exposure One tight slap and all your beliefs will change You've ruined all his best shirts Ruined? These shirts will fetch millions. There'll be grand auctions Supermodel Vimmi's shirts! The ones she wore when she dreamt of success Ladies and gents, do I hear a hundred thousand.. One.. Two.. Three! Jassi, where's my shirt?

I kept telling you we shouldn't allow cable tv in her room All day-and-nights she's whispering to those naked witches on her walls And now she even wants to run away. - No harm in that, no? You go ahead, run away But see, it's 1 1 o'clock. Eat lunch before running What are you saying? - I don't want a weight on my mind.. ..my daughter running away on an empty stomach? I'm warning you, I'll really run away.. ..if you even think of marrying me off.. to that.. that ten out of ten! - Ten out of ten? That ass always got ten out of.. ..ten in every godforsaken subject.. what a nerd Who wouldn't want to marry such a man? - Then why don't you? Spare me Now get out of that outfit and help your mother with the cooking I've called them to lunch tomorrow I want things to be finalised before the evening tea hits the table Enough.

I just.. wanted to be really famous. a name to be reckoned with.. a name in the headlines Vimmi, for the first time in my life l think.. ..I have a talent no one else has I realise now, I never was Rakesh. I've always been Bunty.. I've always enjoyed being him To tell you the truth, I never had the perseverance it takes.. to become a Tata or Ambani, nor the calibre Anyway, doesn't matter now. I think I've discovered my destination And l'm on my way towards it Look.. this is what I want to do.. all my life, freely But you please become a model, a supermodel.. so take care All this.. you did it all alone? That's not what l meant. - Then? Without you.. - You can't walk one step, you know? Wants himself in headlines! Who wants to read about you?

Yes Then why are you screaming taxi-taxi? - Because you need to go Yes.. - So tell me.. where? Where you want to go Who says so? - You or Babli?

Okay, two jokes for you One Mrs and Mr Flea come out after a matinee show Mrs Flea says, l'm tired today Mr Flea says, honey don't worry, I'll hail us a dog You are that dog.. the one they rode for the hike Now spill it, did you go to Center One that night or no? No sir This here, is my second joke Where are those two now? Long time.. gone Names? Bunty and Babli How old are they? Bunty's around 23-24 Babli is 20-21 She was really sweet, well mannered and intelligent, sir Even the boy was all heart, great guy That's quite something, sir No, you asses are quite something To think that petty criminals.. booked for cheating, misdemeanour, malfeasance, fraud and perjury.. are quite something And not just you, the whole lot of you from.. ..this generation is quite something Right and wrong, good esteem and bad, good deeds and bad.. you've forgotten what sets them apart But I can tell the difference. And l'm going to teach you fools too The newspapers say that for boys and girls in schools and colleges.. these two crooks are role models. - So they want to be role models? Fine.. then that's what they'll become.. I'll make them a fine example of a cure for this generation What did you say their names were? - Bunty and Babli This Bunty-Babli better watch out for me We'll always place each other before ourselves Okay We'll never ever break each other's hearts And if we do so accidentally.. ..we won't burst into tears without warning Okay, we will never eat or drink anything without each other Except early morning tea You wake up like a queen at noon I can't wait that long We'll give each other the same amount of love forever Why? We can give more! I'll love you even more tomorrow.. more the day after and so much more the day after the day after We'll cut off all ties with those who don't understand us Except our parents. - Your parents We'll be Bunty-Babli for the rest of our lives And we'll live out all our dreams. - Except.. Except? - Leave that to me Okay Oye Rakesh just married! Look.. right at the outset of this marriage I want to tell you all about my past I don't want any issues later In school, when I was in Class Two, Mukesh used to sit behind me He used to tug at my plaits And you know.. it used to make me giggle like crazy These boys are all scoundrels They'll try their luck with every cute girl How true How lucky I am, you aren't like those boys Rakesh.. you're such a good boy Sweet boy So.. what I was saying was.. ..now that you are my wife.. my mate in joy and sorrow.. for all my days to come.. and nights.. understand? Asleep? On your wedding night! This world we live in has two kinds of people.. those who aren't married and those who are So? So you belong to the latter, no? So? So marry me now you fool Look, above me.. ..the sky's soared away. Look, above me, the sky's soared away. I see my skies breaking free of the earth at the horizon.. soft, slow, on tip-toe bit by thieving bit.. soft, slow, tip-toeing my love soft, slow, on tip-toe bit by thieving bit.. soft, slow, tip-toeing my love soft, slow, on tip-toe bit by thieving bit.. soft, slow, tip-toeing my love Look, see what I see, the earth afloat.. ..earth dissolving in water gushing from who knows where. Then my sky breaks free of the earth at the horizon soft, slow, on tip-toe bit by thieving bit.. soft, slow, tip-toeing my love soft, slow, on tip-toe bit by thieving bit.. soft, slow, tip-toeing my love No consciousness of what I am I have no sense of what I'll be This time now seems unreal This can't be happening to me You slowly dissolve in me I slowly fade into you Our feet stop and our paths shift. The sky rolls over on its bed of clouds. The sky will melt and pelt the earth with rain. The earth dips its toes in the water. It just might stumble to its feet and start strolling around. Soft, slow, on tip-toe bit by thieving bit. Soft, slow, tip-toeing, love. Soft, slow, on tip-toe bit by thieving bit. Soft, slow, tip-toeing, love. Say the word, and I stop. Say the word, and I move. If this is obsession that consumes me, let it set the yardstick for obsession. Say the word, and I stop. Say the word, and I move. A stranger to my destinations, I go where you want me to. Look, above me, the sky's soared away. I see the sky breaking free of the earth at the horizon. Look, see what I see, the earth afloat.. ..earth dissolving in water gushing from who knows where. soft, slow, on tip-toe bit by thieving bit.. soft, slow, tip-toeing my love soft, slow, on tip-toe bit by thieving bit.. soft, slow, tip-toeing my love soft, slow, on tip-toe bit by thieving bit.. soft, slow, tip-toeing my love soft, slow, on tip-toe bit by thieving bit.. soft, slow, tip-toeing my love Babli is Bunty's and Bunty is Babli's Each other's forever they'll be Babli is Bunty's and Bunty is Babli's. Each other's forever.. - They'll be They began their lives.. in small sleepy towns, towns they detested So they popped up in big cities doing the kind of things I detested Not for poverty, need or misfortune. Only for fun Turning to crime for fun? I'd never ever heard that before News of Bunty-Babli's capers poured in from all quarters.. dripping into my ears like red hot molten iron Girls and boys in schools and colleges.. ..began to idolize them as new age heroes Constantly breathing down their necks.. ..I even started to think like them.. what next, their next sharp turn? My hunches were hitting bull's eye.. and I was inching closer to them with every passing day They took their infamy for success and quickly jumped from cons to scams Scams no one had ever heard of or imagined before Okay, how about Kerala? - Too hot Manali? - No, it is too cold Jaipur? - It's too dusty Ladakh? - It's too lonely, Harry How many times am I gonna tell you, it's a damn historical monument.. not a hotel which I can rent That's your problem Harry, you said if we came to India..

One honest man would do for another Papa'ji, you're kidding me By now you must have figured that we aren't half as honest as we seem I don't know what you've done to make these people hunt you down.. but I see a simple honesty in your eyes.. ..take care son God bless you. For the next week or so they'll be baying for our blood We'll return afterwards.. but where have you hidden the gold? What's your baby, a boy or a girl? What will you name your baby? Before you think of a name you need to see the baby at least? A day has gone by, have you even taken one look at your baby? Did you hold your child in your arms, even once.. once even? Vimmi, you know we didn't have any time for these. Had l stopped for all this.. all three of us would've either been jailed or killed by now Some reason for celebration! The day he is born.. his parents die Cursed fate to be born with! - Not his fault, is it? That's what I'm saying! What wrong has he done.. to deserve parents who can go to jail anytime.. leaving him to rot on the streets What are you trying to say? - Enough I won't do this anymore. Neither will you.. Then what else can we do? Anything, whatever everyone else does If we had to end up doing what everybody else does.. why did we ever run away from home? Because we were wrong Now we're not free to live as we like. Now we're responsible for one more life How's he going to grow up? How? With us.. ..that's how With us? And which school will he go to You know this world we live in has two kinds of people. One.. who waste the best years of their lives in schools and colleges. And the kind who school themselves. Like us. We taught us to do what we're doing Which is what he'll learn? - Of course! And then he'll go to jail someday? Have we ever been to jail? We very nearly got thrown into jail I don't want my son growing up behind bars.. or dying young on the run Do you remember agreeing on all our marriage vows except.. We'll be Bunty-Babli for the rest of our lives And we'll live out all our dreams. - Except.. Except? - Leave that to me Okay This is the exception Rakesh You're getting over-emotional about this motherhood business But now l am whatever l am. Now I want to hear your decision Choose. lt's either this life.. or a life together So what have you decided? What'll I do without the two of you? Those marriage vows weren't mere words Fursatganj or Pankinagar? Is it you that's saying this or? Bunty and Rakesh. Both What? - Tickets Since when are we buying tickets? - From today Why become so damn honest? Oye Rakesh, you're in love Oh all right Rakesh my boy, this world we live in has two kinds of men. One.. the kind that thinks twice before getting married And the kind that thinks afterwards like you, you idiot Two tickets for Fursatganj Name? Rakesh Trivedi, Vimmi Trivedi Bunty and Babli You've had a long run. You must be tired Rakesh. Can we have some water? Die of thirst dog! Not for me. For the two of them You won't believe me.. ..but we quit being crooks half an hour ago Absolutely right, I won't believe you. - But if l insist I'm telling the truth? I'll start doing right now what I had planned to do to you in jail Why are you looking at me like that? - He's telling the truth Guaranteed by you, India's biggest bonafide liar? I'm not lying A dog's tail insists it became ramrod straight half an hour ago? You're as old as my father.. ..no one's had the cheek to talk to her like that So you respect your elders now, do you? - And why shouldn't we? Now don't tell me you pray first thing every morning too! She does So? - So what! Now you pray to your heart's content in jail! It's all your fault now suffer. - My fault? Who's idea was it to go straight? - It was for a good cause.. do you want your son to go to jail? - So where's he going now? Now I see how the two of you have been fooling people for years Pappu is hungry Pappu? When did we start calling him Pappu? Got to call him something no? You're thinking of the gold all the time Let's step outside for a while I'm not going anywhere. - Up Darned luck. No one ever caught us when we were in the thick of it But the moment we quit.. Why did you get into all this? I wanted to become someone important. And.. you became? You won't understand. - Why.. why won't I understand? Because he never did. - Who? My father He's just like you You're trying to con me again May l? - A smoke? Sure.. Where are you going? If she sees me smoking she'll scream The child will stay with the mother What's the use of crying now? Should've considered this beforehand. - What else to do? Become a ticket collector and collect ten rupee bribes all my life? You can come in We'll have to make a phone call to your home or mine We certainly can't take him with us. No, it won't come to that I'll figure something. And con ourselves out of this one too? What else to do? Take with me to jail.. ..the very son for whose sake I gave up everything? What justice! Jails are for reforming. And here, three people are being jailed Two of whom have reformed and a third who's completely innocent Don't worry Vimmi. I'll crack a plan. - What plan Rakesh? We've run out of plans Vimmi do you have any idea what jails are like? How will you spend so many years inside one? Let's do something, l'll take the blame for everything Then you're free to go home to Fursatganj with the baby All you wanted was to become a model I dragged you into this whole thing You can't even make a cup of tea for yourself. In jail.. how? - I'll manage Vimmi.. ..don't worry about me Have you ever managed to do anything alone? In any case, Bunty is nothing without Babli Get up Unlock yourselves.. I can't do it.. We're nearing the railway signal on the outskirts of Delhi The train halts there for two minutes The two of.. the three of you can get off and go wherever you wish No one recognises Bunty and Babli except me And no one ever will Sir.. - Shut up. Not a word Or l just might change my mind Get going That's enough Whether it was my life's biggest mistake.. ..or their best con act, I didn't know But policemen are human too, believe it or not.. we wear those uniforms only on our body, ..at heart we're as vulnerable as babies I believed I had destroyed Bunty-Babli, so l let Rakesh and Vimmi go.. because l think the law needs to destroy crime, not lives The bank's gold was recovered from the spot Babli had indicated The recoveries continued for months afterwards.. monies and valuables stolen by Bunty and Babli I think they had told me the truth about going back.. to live respectable, honest lives like their parents Rakesh'ji could you perhaps increase the pressure What a joy This world we live in has two kinds of Pappus. One.. the kind who obey their parents and get to eat chocolates and the kind that doesn't and gets locked up inside toilets You are? - The first My darling baby But he didn't even drink his milk. He'll eat the chocolate What good are chocolates? You and your fads No, I'm feeling cold.. - Forget the cold. Be fashionable What are you teaching Pappu? To speak the truth and pray every morning Where's my son? One of his friends is waiting downstairs Friends and folks in Fursatganj find all the time for fun You fix the name of this city. I'll fix this friend My son is genius from.. childhood I am very lucky I got a daughter-in-law who is very very smart It's such a joy to know that our son and his wife.. ..have done things.. so important that your department still remembers them Never told folks at home what all you achieved? Maybe you should tell us Nervous already? A scam is in the offing Huge scam Sir.. I swear by my son, l've given it up I've no idea of what scams are happening For three years now, I'm following a work-home-work routine This scam has got to be stopped. - Then go ahead and stop it We cannot stop it Who else can? You Please save us from this life of honesty and respectfulness. Please. Is it just you, or.. - Both of us. I'd choose death over making mango pickle. I'd rather die, Rakesh. Have faith in God. Faith prevails. One step, two steps, he steps it up, swings it pumps it, struts his stuff. Meet Bunty. Minute by minute, she turns it up, spins it so you can't get enough. Meet Babli. Swami.. Bunty Ramaswami. Mandalam.. Babli Cholamandalam. Bunty Aur Babli Bunty and Babli They maybe two, but they're too much. Once upon a time he told me that he was in the business of cleaning So l put them on the job of cleaning up society Bunty Aur Babli Bunty and Babli They maybe two, but they're too much.
