The new era will be called Heisei. REN TAKAHASHI BORN HEISEI 1 (1989) JANUARY 8TH HEISEI 13 (2001) Hey, Takehara! -You're late, Ren! -Practice ran overtime. -Let's go! -We won't make it on time. Yeah, we will! Come on! So pretty. Yeah. Takehara! Look, the fireworks! -We're almost there! -Hurry! That is the end of the fireworks. Areas near the venue are expected to be crowded. Please watch your step on your way home. -Aoi, let's go. -Have a great night. I want to stay here just a bit longer. Can we, Yumi? Ugh, we missed it! For real? Ow… Aww… This sucks. Here. Are you okay? Your arm. Uh… Let me do it. Thanks. You're such a loser, Ren. Shut up. So, my family runs a car repair shop. They don't care how I do at school. And you? Same. Yeah? I'm in the soccer club right now. I'm the only 1st grader that made it onto the team. That's amazing. Go on! Go! -Go! -You can do it! I knew I'd see you again. -You text me too much. -What? Hey, I'm into music. I'm going to be famous when I grow up. Go, Ren! Over here! Go for it! Nice one! Here. For me? Whoa! Thanks. So good! It's the best ever! Really? When did he get…? I've never seen Aoi look so happy like that. Can I keep this? It'll be our friendship bracelet. When I grow up, I want to play soccer at the National Stadium. I want to make it on the national team and play soccer around the world. I know you can do it. Thanks. What's your dream? Me? I want an ordinary life. I don't need to travel the world. Yeah? You know… I have a crush on you, Aoi! Thanks! I don't want to go home. We'll see each other tomorrow. Your parents will be worried if you don't go home. See you tomorrow on the hills of Biei! Yumi? Aoi didn't come to school today. No one's home. I was worried because her family is strange. Her father is deceased. Aoi never liked to talk about her family. This is it. It seemed like she often got meals for free here. They left early this morning. Like they were running away. I always heard that young guy yelling. I told the town office several times about it. But her mother kept covering up for him. It was just yesterday. She brought an empty lunch box over. She asked me to teach her how to cook. Oh, how happy she looked. HEISEI 20 (2008) BIEI, HOKKAIDO PREFECTURE -Next! -Sure. -Hey! What's wrong with you? -Sorry. Hanaoka, take over! Coming! You go polish. Okay. Hurry! Thanks for the meal. Gotcha! Are you frustrated with the world or yourself? Come again? You're always so grouchy. Why do you work here in the first place? I bought a new car. But you commute by bike. I crashed it into a tractor. I have four years left of the loan. So you were willing to take any job? Actually, I was looking for a job here in Biei. Why Biei? Just because. YUMI AND I ARE ENGAGED! FROM TAKEHARA HEISEI 21 (2009) -I'll take your coat. -Thank you. Here is your coat tag. The reception is this way, sir. -Uh… Hi. -Congratulations. Congratulations. You're making me nervous! I've never done it before. Takehara! -You look ridiculous! -You too! -Congrats, man! -Thanks! -Oh yeah. Come here. -What? What? Aoi Sonoda. She's coming to the wedding today. Right, Yumi? I ran into her the other day in Shibuya. HEISEI 13 (2001) SAPPORO, HOKKAIDO BUILDING 3 SUSUKINO RESIDENCE Hello? Ren? Aoi? Yumi asked the school for your address for me. What happened to your eye? Uh, hey, I'm sorry. I didn't know. It's just two more years. When I graduate, I'll work. I'll bear it until then. I have no other choice. No matter what they do to me. Move, brat. I told you not to sit there! You tick me off. Mommy! You got a problem? You think you're so smart studying? Huh? Let's go. You can't stay with them. I came here before on a campout. The janitor is absent during the winter. It's just for tonight. Nobody will know. I heard it on the news. It's been three months since the 9/11 attacks. The site will be open to the public at the end of this month. People are still removing debris and searching for victims. The area around the building has turned into a place of prayer. Ren. And I think… This isn't going to work. Though we can't bring back the lost lives, it's time for the world to come together I have an uncle who runs an apple orchid in Aomori Prefecture. I'm sure he'd help us. We'll go to Hakodate and take the ferry from there. We start this program with this song… We can pick apples together. …"Threads" by Miyuki Nakajima. I will protect you. We know absolutely nothing About why we meet someone We never know Why are the lights on? When we will meet someone We never know Where were you? Where did you come from? Two stories… Let's go. Beneath the faraway skies You are the vertical thread… Thanks. It's fine, Ren. Let's go back. The cloth we weave might someday Keep someone warm. Kids! Stop right there! You two! Stop right there! -Kids! -Stop! Hey, you! You little punk! -Don't hit him! -Aoi! -Are you all right? -I was so worried about you! Mommy. You better tell them that you fell. Got it? Wait! Insecure, shaking in the wind You are the vertical thread And l am the horizontal one Aoi! The cloth we weave might someday Aoi! Help nurse someone's injury Aoi! You are the vertical thread And l am the horizontal one Excuse me. We were born when the new era of Heisei began! Our parents loved and cherished us. We had a wonderful childhood. In junior high, I developed a passion for music. -Freddie! -Yo, superstar! Now, I work at Tosei Construction, a leading company. This is when we first met. We were 12 years old. We met at a fireworks festival. I knew it was destiny. You know, it was rock 'n' roll. He kept trying to talk to me. At first, I thought he was annoying. But then I started to think he was like a puppy. What the heck?! Your wife is so pretty. Right? This is so unfair. You saw her in December last year. -I did? -You did. -No way. -Yes, you did. -Ah, that ugly… -She's not ugly! Want some? No? It's been a long time, Ren. What have you been up to, Sonoda? I work at a cheese factory. -In Hokkaido? -Yeah. -All this time? -Yep. Today is my first time in Tokyo. What an amazing city. -What about soccer? -Soccer? Oh. I quit in high school. You said you'd become a world-famous soccer player. I just wasn't cut out for it. Do you remember the friendship bracelet? I do. You do? I wonder where it went? What did I do with it? Here. Thanks. So? What have you been up to? I'm studying business at university. Seriously? Of course we've changed. We're no longer in junior high. Thanks. Your tie is crooked. We've been on and off so many times. You know how it is. Oh yeah? But I promise to make Yumi happy from here onwards. He's drunk. I'm sorry. Congrats, guys. I have to go now. I'm gonna miss you. -Then let's go. -Of course, I'm going. Hey, about that friendship bracelet. To be honest, I was wearing it until just recently. But it fell off just the other day. I'm glad I met you. Bye. A YEAR BEFORE Here's another girl! She's hot! She's a hottie, and we want to see her chug! We want to see her chug! Hang on. I'll drink for her! She can't drink much. What good is a hostess if she can't drink? Look at my nails. I work as a nail technician during the daytime. Wow, so pretty. Like I'd care! I'm sick of ya! I'm a paying customer. Get lost! Leave our table! I'll drink. Mr. Mizushima? I knew you could drink! Good girl! -Look at this. -What is it? You like it? I've brought you Aoi. Hey, you. Move. You sit next to Mr. Mizushima. I'm from Tokyo. I live with my mother so I have money, but I had nothing to do. I was just curious about this whole hostess thing. I also make websites. But the salary is better, and it's fun talking to the customers. You're lying. You need the money. You have nobody. What? MEIO UNIVERSITY We're a music club. Who wants to make music with us? -Would you like to join us? -Please take a look. Wanna join our basketball team? It's those nightmares again. I've been there. Just like you. You know, money can make most things better. Aoi, come live here with me, will you? HEISEI 21 (2009) JANUARY 21ST Yes. This is Sasaki. Investors from the West Coast made another 1.5 billion cancellation. We survived the financial crash last year. Yes, but… We're fine. Here, this is yours. Use it as you like. I told you I don't want it anymore. I can handle my tuition. Just take it. I'll earn my own money. And go back to what it was before? See ya! I'm off. See you. What are you staring at? -See ya. -See you tomorrow. Bye. Knock it off. No thanks. You're absent-minded even during work these days. I bet you were dumped by a chick or something. -As for me… -I get it. I'll be more focused at work. I started dating him back in junior high. Ten years. Ten whole years. His family had a potato farm, so I helped on my days off. I was going to live in this town with him and his family forever. That was my plan. But I saw it. He went to a university in Sapporo. He met her there. She was helping with the potatoes. She was beaming. A junior high school crush is not going to last forever. Let it go. It's all in the past. Why are you crying? What's there to cry about? Get it together! Kaori Kirino! How do you create a system that makes money effortlessly? It's when your commodities fly off the shelf on their own. What a great idea. Once you get this going, you'll… Aoi? Do you know where Mr. Mizushima is? What happened? He ran. What? We took a hit last year when the Lehman Brothers went down. He said everything was fine. He said he saw it coming. No one in Japan could have seen that coming. Ah, but lucky you. You got enough out of him, right? I knew you'd be here. Your fishing gear was gone. This was always your favorite place. This time, I'll take care of you. This is not where you belong. So what? What's the matter? There's no catch. Come join us. Come. Come on, Aoi! Just one year. All because Yumi met another guy. And her, she works in admin. She was there for me. That's when I realized that I was destined to be with her. I don't care how much you make fun of me. I won't. I'm the same too. -Sorry, I'm late. -Hey! -We took time cleaning up. -Yeah? That sucks. This is Kaori Kirino. We work together at the cheese factory. So, we're moving in together next week. -This is Takehara. -Hi. -And Riko. -Riko. -This is Rika. -Nice to meet you. You did the right thing divorcing her! -Thanks. -He's drunk. What matters is the present, not the past. You look so happy. -Am I right? -You are. -Right? -Yes, Ma'am. You need a woman like this, Ren. What do you mean? Not someone who walks after you but leads you instead. Who wears the pants. And I think Riko is a perfect match for you. How so? I spill something, and she wipes it up right away. Wipe it up yourself! Sorry, Riko. Thanks. I don't care what people say. I approve. Riko and Takehara are meant to be. There you have it. Why cry? We wiped the table with that. Gross! I'm going to sing. You are? Ren! You better make Kaori happy! Life in this small town suits a man like me. -What's wrong with small? -Whoa. You scared me. Where'd that come from? I only have a junior high school education So I can't get a job Hey, must you sing that? The words written by the girl from Osaka Are sharp but shaky Even though I told everyone flippantly That I had mistakenly burned it I couldn't do that, and instead sent it So I sent you the ticket to Tokyo With the printing smudged by my tears Fight! Sing your fight song Those who do not fight may laugh Fight! Swim trembling against the current Through the cold water TRANSFER OF RESIDENCE BIEI TOWN Excuse me. No one is living at this address. Did anyone come for the paperwork? Um… Is something the matter? I got a letter about my mother's welfare. I haven't seen her in years. I see. -Let me check up on that. -Sure. Ren, just forget it. Maybe the neighbors will know. Hey! Do the dishes before you go out and play. Maybe she knows. Let's go. Being here brings back too many memories. When I was small, I'd come watch the clouds here. I never knew when I'd be beaten. My mother is the one to blame for not stopping her boyfriend from beating her own daughter. Just once is enough. I want her to apologize for it. That's why I came back. It's not because I missed her. Don't you have relatives? I have an uncle in Hakodate. Hey, you've done enough. Don't you have work? Remember when we met in Sapporo? It was freezing. Your hands. It hurt. The way you held my hands. I actually visited your apartment in Sapporo after that. You had already moved. After that, he started to beat my mother too. So we ran to Tokyo. But my mom couldn't live without a man. She found a new man and stopped coming home. I wanted to finish high school and go to university. I had to lie about my age to work anywhere. So I became a hostess. You were a hostess? Right now, I live in Okinawa. With a man. The one that picked you up? I've drifted so far. It's been a hectic nine years, huh. And look at me. They tore us apart that day, and I was powerless. I've always felt powerless somewhere in my heart. I never left Hokkaido. I haven't taken so much as a step. Answer it. It's someone I met at the factory. We're moving in together. It was her liver. She showed up last month. By that time, her body was already a wreck. I hadn't seen her in a decade, but she was still my little sister. Do you want her bones? Are you okay? Hey, Ren. Do you remember what you said to me on the day we met? You said, "Are you okay?" You saw the bandage on my arm. You were the one who was hurt, but you asked if I was okay. I was my happiest when I was with you. It was the first time in my life that I was glad I was born. I'm so sorry. I couldn't protect you. I let go of your hand. I'm so sorry. Why are you apologizing? She's gone now. I wish she had apologized to me, even just once. But to be honest… I wanted her to hug me, even just once. This is where the ferry to Aomori was supposed to depart from. Did you really have an uncle in Aomori? Of course! Not. There wasn't? Thanks. Sonoda, I… I'm going to live my life in that small town. A simple, ordinary life. Then, I'll travel around the world instead. You'll manage, won't you? You always have. Goodbye, Ren. This is a final boarding call for Flight 582, bound for Haneda, departing at 19:35. The flight will leave from Gate 5. The doors will close in five minutes. Please proceed to Gate 5 immediately. Goodbye, Aoi. Aoi. You don't need me anymore. I must move on. You don't belong here either. Why is it about money until the end? HEISEI 23 (2011) CHANGI AIRPORT, SINGAPORE Aoi! I can't believe you came. Me neither. Hi. He's Saejima, our driver. He does the admin as well. Welcome to Singapore. Thank you. Let's go. Reiko couldn't speak a word when she came. I told you they'd hire you right away. They think the Japanese are good with their hands. Though, very few stick around. Why? They think it's cool to work overseas and get crushed by reality. How about you? Me? I followed my crush here. But was dumped right away. Totally crushed by reality. Do you have a boyfriend? You're hitting on her? It gets lonely being alone overseas. Not interested. -Dumped again! -That's not true. You dumped him, right? What's up? I'm practicing. I'm going to travel around the world. I made a promise to someone. Can we enter competitions like these too? What? The World Cheese Competition? Are you trying to take on the world? Maybe. No way. Forget it. I'm going to do it. You think he means that? Reiko! What happened? The customer was not happy, and we fought. Idiot. Wait a minute! Aoi, let it go. Let's go home. I only came here to run away from stuff back home. I'll go home to Japan. Japanese nail technicians are in high demand. We can dispatch technicians. If all goes well, we can recruit technicians from Japan. It's easy to register a company and open a bank account. It's easy to start a business in Singapore. It won't work. I should just go home now. You can't. If you run home just because someone bullies you, you'll have nightmares about it for a really long time. I'll protect you, Reiko. Aoi… Hey. Saejima will be my sidekick. What's this about? We're going to make money to start our own business. Switch with me. No whining. But this is so heavy. You're pulling too hard. No, I'm not. The Merlion has been venerated as the guardian of prosperity. This way, please. I will be right there. -How's it hanging? -We're so busy. Me too. The lettuce is destroying my nails. -You know what? -What? I don't want to be protected. I want to protect people. Huh? Become someone that'll never let go of the hand I hold. We're going to go as far as we can together! It's done. Right, boss? Don't call me that. It's just on paper. We are equal partners. -Boss! -Like I said… Look! What the…? No… FOUNDING DAY, MARCH 11TH This is footage of the Sanriku Coast in Iwate Prefecture. What looks like a vortex can be seen in the distance. Tsunamis larger than ten meters are expected. The tsunami has just reached the houses. It is extremely dangerous. Those living in these areas, please evacuate immediately. The coast and riversides are dangerous… Kaori! If you are unable to evacuate, try to find a concrete building and stay on the third floor or above. Kaori? Ren? What's wrong? Are you okay? Yeah. The baby is okay. We're reporting to you live from the Sanriku Coast. This can't be happening! More tsunamis may form… Hokkaido is experiencing Seismic Intensity Two earthquakes… NAOKI TAKEHARA Hey, dude. Is everything okay over there? She's alive. Huh? Who? Riko, duh. She was visiting her parents. In Iwate. In Iwate? I got hold of her. Good. Despite that enormous tsunami, she survived. I'm so relieved. I'm so glad. This afternoon, an enormous magnitude-8.8 earthquake struck Japan. Tsunamis over eight meters high have hit eastern Miyagi Prefecture. This… is a small story that happened in a small town. Compared to Takehara and the people in the Tohoku region, what's happening to me is nothing. During the checkup today… they found it. A tumor. -Honey? -Yeah? Honey? It's Kaori. I'm having the baby. But… You should put your health first. That kind of thinking is so outdated. Cancer is curable these days. I won't die. No. I can't allow it. Do the operation now. I looked for the best doctor, and he said it was okay. I'll do chemo, then have a C-section to have the baby. Then, they will remove the tumor. Don't be so worried. I'm going to get through this. This is not something to take lightly. This is your life. Me too. I think you should do as your father says. I've already decided. I'm going to survive this. Hey, Ren! Hi! -Congratulations. -Thank you. She's tiny. How adorable. -This is Yui. -Yui? Oh, you made her cry! She's crying! Watch out! -She is not scared at all. -You did well. Let's go back in. Gulp, gulp. -Good girl. -I'll eat too. Is she eating it? -Very nice. -My turn. Yui! HEISEI 26 (2014) Mommy, look. Oh, but I just bought you clothes. Very cute. This one's too big. Come. What's with the tears, Ren Takahashi? Daddy? Yui. Give Daddy a hug. If someone is crying, give them a hug. Right, who's hungry? What would you like? Sorry. WORLD CHEESE COMPETITION 2014 YOU HAVE NOT BEEN CHOSEN Ren. Take the day off. I'm sorry. Kaori? Oh? I thought you were at work today. I knew we'd get caught. I asked him to come. I mean, ten years. We'd been dating since junior high. I wanted to see all the people I met in my life. You'll have plenty of time to see them. You know what? Maybe I loved him more than you. Oh yeah? I wanted to be a flight attendant. I was even studying for it at school. I never wanted to work at a potato farm. But it was by chance… purely by chance… There was a poster looking for staff at the cheese factory. I happened to notice it. The cheese was so good too. If I had become a flight attendant, I wouldn't have met you. You can tell me more about that stuff after you leave the hospital. You know how we say "the thread of destiny"? I believe it exists. But that thread… sometimes… gets tangled. Sometimes, it even snaps. But it will connect to something once more. If you stay alive, it will always lead to something new. I think that's how the world works. Don't you? Please take care of Yui. Okay? That's enough. -But I… -I don't want to hear it! Just hear me out. I don't care what people say. I have no regrets. I was so happy. Go. You don't need to be here. Why do you even have that? Go now, Ren. IN LOVING MEMORY OF KAORI TAKAHASHI Daddy? Hurts. Sorry. Kaori, you fought well. Kaori. Yui. Life isn't about moving up in the world. Just be someone that gives a hug if anyone is crying or feeling sad. Okay. Yay! YOU HAVE NOT BEEN CHOSEN -And Saejima? -Yes, ma'am? Too sour. Nothing special. -Yummy. -Yeah? Is your finger okay? I'm okay. / You are? Good. You like this? This? You're right, it's good. HEISEI 30 (2018) She's acting like a boss. Did I hear the words domestic demand? The customers at the hostess club used to go on about that. The two of us, together. The bank keeps calling us. It's Reiko. Follow me. She used the company money on real estate and was a victim of fraud. She even went behind our backs and borrowed money from the bank. They want it back by tomorrow. Reiko! Let me go! I want to go as far as I can. Alone. I'm sorry. I can't believe that people betray others like this. Do you have money to pay the bank? I really didn't want to use this money. But this money is all I can rely on in the end. Saejima. Thanks for everything. One pork cutlet rice bowl. Yes, ma'am. We know absolutely nothing About why we meet someone We never know When we will meet someone Where were you? Where did you come from? -Two stories -Your pork cutlet rice bowl. Beneath the faraway skies You are the vertical thread Thanks for the meal. And I am the horizontal one The cloth we weave might someday Keep someone warm Yuck. Why do we live? The frays after days of ambivalence Running, chasing after a dream I'll be fine. The frays after days of falling down I'll be fine. What will this thread become? Insecure, shaking in the wind You are the vertical thread… Thanks, Ren. I love this cheese. Good. But you don't have to do this. It's been four years now. You're young. You need to move on. Oh, please. Stop it. Kaori was my life. I'll live the rest of my life with Kaori's memories in my heart. Yum. But you can't do that. You can't waste your life drinking in broad daylight. Easy now. I feel the same way too. Go. You don't need to be here. Go. Go now. Hokkaido is the best. You should move and live here. You'll have Ren. We should move out here and run a farm. That's hilarious. Takehara working on a farm? So funny. Whoa. -I need to go pee. -Wipe this up! There you have it. She keeps talking nonstop if you let her be. The next day, she won't say anything, no matter what you ask her. She saw too much during the earthquake. Kids screaming for help while sinking into the water. It's been seven years. Seven damn years. But you're both alive. Sorry. My bad. It's not just us, I know. Those were the days. Riding our bikes to the Biei fireworks. We didn't have a worry in the world. What's your problem, you up there! I've had enough. It's not like I'm asking for much. All I want is to live an ordinary life. Right! I wanted to become a singer, remember? Hey, must you sing that? I only have a junior high school education -I'm sorry. I got carried away. -So I can't get a job -The words written by the girl from Osaka -I'm sorry. Are sharp but shaky Called a punk and slapped in the face The kid's eyes grow older Fists are clenched in frustration So hard the nails stab the palms Actually I saw it with my own eyes On the stairs in the train station The boy who rumbled down And the smirk on the face Of the woman who pushed him I was shocked Neither tried to help nor scream I just got scared and ran away My enemy is myself Fight! Sing your fight song Those who do not fight may laugh Fight! Swim trembling against the current Through the cold water Battered by the flow of the dark water The fish climb upstream They shine because their scales Half scraped off, shake in the water It would be better to go with the flow Easier to float back down But instead they grow thin, losing flesh As they swim upstream Fight! Sing your fight song Those who do not fight may laugh Fight! Swim trembling against the current Through the cold water HEISEI 31 (2019) -Was it a tough week? -I guess. -Thank you. -Thank you. Ms. Sonoda? Yes? Can you go buy lunch for me? Of course, boss. I want fried chicken. Ask the other girls too. Here you are. I came to fetch you. I started a beauty salon company in Singapore. You're so tough. Of course I am. I've worked hard this past year, all so I can work with you once more. Sorry, I don't have much time. I'll be waiting in Singapore. Saejima… People come into your life when you really need them. That's why I met you. Thanks, Saejima. I'll think about it, I mean it. SPRING MENU RELEASE PARTY -This way, please. -May I take your jacket? It was something I wrote off as a failure. I was unhappy with everything I made. I was frustrated and just mixed everything together. Then my daughter said it was yummy. I brushed it up and sold it at our store, and it sold better than the others. Then, this restaurant decided to use that cheese on its menu. So, yeah. They have three Michelin stars, you know! Their world-famous chef loves your cheese. You should be thrilled. I screw up, and the world likes that better. That's so typical of me. ROUTE SEARCH PROVIDING WARM MEALS… PROVIDING WARM MEALS TO CHILDREN WHO NEED THEM CHILDREN'S CAFETERIA Today is the last day of the 31-year-long Heisei period. Let's ask for people's thoughts. How was the Heisei period for you? Uh… Well… It was peaceful, so that's good. But the economy sucked. Our generation didn't benefit from the bubble economy. I don't understand why we have these different periods. It was a period of challenge. Terrorism. Natural disasters. Social polarization. Poverty. I was born in the first year of Heisei. Right? How was the Heisei period for me? That's a vague question that's difficult to answer. But I… we are now 30 years old. Hey, Ren! Ren! Hi. Here we go. Hey! Where are your manners? Thanks for the meal! Run along now. Come on, boys. I don't know. One thing led to another and here we are. I'm not doing it for someone else. I'm being a hypocrite. Was it tough these past 20 years? It sure was. How did this begin? The beginning? A girl living nearby used to look through that window. So I gestured for her to come in, and she did. I gave her something warm to eat. Then her face lit up. That smile left a strong impression on me. I wonder what she's up to now. I wish I could see her again. Thanks for the meal. CHILDREN'S CAFETERIA -Thanks for the meal. -Enjoy! I wonder why. The food here is the best. I feel like I'm home. I thought I didn't have anywhere to come home to. This is your home. If someone is crying, give them a hug. My mommy taught me that. What a wonderful mom you have. You should let the kids do their dishes. -I want to help. -Aww. No. You can't take all the cheese for yourself. -You have to share. -Okay. Cheese? She came here to deliver some cheese. -Thanks. -Thank you. Daddy! Why are you here? -Bye, Ms. Murata! See you! -Thanks, dear. Bye! -Bye-bye! -Yui! -Are you okay? -Yep. I thought you came home tomorrow. I couldn't wait to see you, so I came home early. Her mother passed away. Poor child. It's the last day of Heisei, after all. -Did they like the cheese? -They did! That's good. -Hurry. They're waiting. -Oops. Sorry. Cheers. Congratulations. This is incredible. Way to go, Ren! Thank you so much. But I haven't given up yet. I'm going to try to win first prize at the World Cheese Competition. It connects me with the world while being here in Biei. Sure. -That's it? -I really mean it! Yeah, yeah. There's none left? What's wrong, Yui? You know what? A lady was crying earlier, so I gave her a hug. You did? She said that I have a wonderful mommy. She thinks my mommy is cool. Ms. Murata said, "This is your home," to that lady. -What's up? -Take care of Yui for me! Where are you going? You're right. What got into me? Gotcha! -She's gone. -Where'd she go? To ride the ferry from Hakodate. Thank you! She's… She's a tough girl! -Thank you. -Thank you. HEISEI COUNTDOWN EVENT FIRST REIWA CRUISE Thank you for coming to our Hakodate countdown event. It seems people have gathered in locations all over Japan. People await this historic moment in their own locations. The Heisei period is coming to an end! There are only ten minutes left. Please board. Excuse me. Excuse me. Aoi! We know absolutely nothing About why we meet someone We never know When we will meet someone Where were you? Where did you come from? Two stories Beneath the faraway skies Aoi! You are the vertical thread And I am the horizontal one Ren? The cloth we weave might someday Keep someone warm Ren! Why do we live? The frays after days of ambivalence Running, chasing after a dream The frays after days of falling down What will this thread become? Insecure, shaking in the wind You are the vertical thread Sonoda? And I am the horizontal one Aoi! The cloth we weave might someday Help nurse someone's injury You are the vertical thread And l am the horizontal one When the right two threads meet each other People call it happiness There are only ten seconds remaining until the new era. -Aoi! -Here comes the dawn of a new era. -Three, two, one! -Aoi! Aoi! Aoi! Are you okay? YOU CAN NEVER BE TOO CHEESY IN LOVE LIKE FINE CHEESE, MARRIAGE GETS BETTER WITH AGE
