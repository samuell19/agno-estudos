I Didn't plan on moving. That's a very nice snake you got there. It's a Black Cobra. She can bite in an instant. Very painful when she does. Your whole body circulation breaks down Your blood stops flowing. And five minutes later, you can say hello to your creator. I'm an atheist. Don't panic. Just stopped sweating. AHHH! Oh Man!!! There......Shit! Now, how was that? Super! Didn't you forget something? Oh Yah, Thanks Sharon. I didn't think that I would ever have to say that to anyone, but.. well, you just saved my life. You can treat me to dinner. I think that I deserve it now. That's what you would like right? You better be careful now, ok? Yah right, what are you up to now? I'm off for the next two days. Ciao. Dan.. Hey Dan!? Don't you have any talent other than sleeping? You won't believe what just happened to me, Listen up... hey... awwwww! Stephen! Stephen? Steffen, Stephen say anything, Stephen. Are you all right? Everything OK? Don't, don't know. How do I look? If you ask me, I'd say you'd have to do something about your hair. Could it be somehow, you're having a bad day today? Man!. Are you OK? Yah, I think so. Dan? .... Dan? Yah? You have to come down here. You have to see this. What is this? You really found this here just like this Stephen? Yah. What's that, what's going on? Aren't you able to see for yourself? This is plastic. And what does that mean? This means that someone else has done some excavating before us. It also means that all the other fossils we found might not be authentic either. It means this excavation site has no value at all. Well I have some ideas on how to make some money from this cave We could make some kind of amusement park out of it. Every man's excavation. Professor. Take a look over here. What's that? Amazing. Roland, look at that. It could be the remains of the decay of the Neno-Toxin Spores What kind of spores? Neno-Toxis Spores are a type of fungus that was last recorded in the 3rd century Therefore gentlemen, that would mean that this skeleton here is at least 1800 years old. Wow Hey, I guess your little stunt earlier was worth something Roland, call Jerusalem tell them to come here with their mobile laboratory We should also send them a sample for radio carbon dating I have to make an important phone call. I will be back soon Meanwhile, no one touches anything in here. Is that clear? You were right. The radio Carbon dating shows that the skeleton is around 2000 years old. This was the third test we performed on it. But here is the most amazing thing. Excuse me... May I? I took another sample. You see this here? Cavities. I'm aware that dental care wasn't wide spread 2000 years ago. Yah, that's exactly what I always thought. But do you see these black spots here? Yes? We examined those spots..... and found that there's residue of amalgam. Amalgam ? Are you absolutely certain? Excuse me, Professor. But, I think I've I found something else strange. See that? What is that? It a splint for a broken leg. Repaired with a rust proof titanium screw. It's healed very nicely. This kind of procedure has only been around for the last 10 years. If you calculate the time it takes for a leg to competely heal, I'd would say this skeleton Can't be older than 7-8 years. But...., I don't understand.. that's just impossible. Amalgam and titanium screws ... What happened to the bag? You remember, the little plastic bag that we found next to the skeleton. We didn't look inside of it. It's up in the laboratory. Well, maybe this will shed some light on this case. Uhh..., it's some sort of booklet. Something glued to it. Hand me the small spatula please. It looks like writing. It's been bleached out It'll take some effort to make it visible again Let's take a ..... ... a look at the rest of it. That's impossible. Sony? That's .....that's an instruction manual for a video camera. I.P. 270E. I've never heard of that model before. But..none of this makes any sense. No, no no It makes complete sense. Only if you just consider one thing. I'm curious as to what that might be. Just let him finish what he's going to say As long as we don't have any ideas ourselves we should at least listen to him. Well... Our friend here is a human being from the present Who died 2,000 years ago. Don't you get what I mean? In other words, he... he... he's a time traveler. ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha [the group is all laughing] I'm sorry, but that's stupid! I think we all need some sleep now. Tomorrow morning we'll be driving to the laboratory in Jerusalem and make the writing on this paper visible again. Gentlemen sleep well tonight And don't forget that we're scientists, and not science fiction writers. Dan? Get everything together. Put the rest of it in. Let's go! Dan, Dan, come on get up! They're leavinge without us. Dan! Jesus. Dan wake up, Willfort and the others are leaving. Come on! You are amazing... unbelievable!! Hey, hey! Professor hey! Please wait! Hey... hey hey wait! Hey! What's up? You just can't leave without us. Who is us? Well,...Dan and I. Just stop for a second. Stephen listen, you're just a student. And if I may say so.. not a very dilegent one. Don't get me wrong I really like you, and I think you're talented. But you're only an assisstant on this site. If I took you with me now, then all the others would have to come. Come on Professor please. I mean, after all it was I who found the skeleton. And you know that something like this is the reason I decided to study archeology to begin with. Alright, get in. Could we...Could we at least wait for Dan? I mean..... Either you get in the car now Or you are going to stay. I can't wait any longer. Let's go! School of Abdominal Reflectography. We're using a brand new method It uses the fact that there was a chemical reaction at the spot where where the ink was applied to the paper our infrared rays will break differently at those spots. Let's see what your traveler has to report now. As long as the computer shines the infrared light on the entire spectrum on the monitor you can't see anything. We have to filter out some details first. at the spots where the exchange of the absorption reflection happens. We have special filters to do that. There. Amazing, there is something. Arrived. I'm reading the word "Arrived". Keep on going. Could... Not... Remember... It's like hangman. Hangman? Yah a game. You have to find the missing letters. I think it says, I couldn't remember much anymore. Remember what? Well, If we believe that he's a time traveler, Maybe the voyage created some kind of amnesia. Maybe some aliens created the amnesia. Well, the age of the paper, the titanium screws, the amalgam fillings... If it wasn't so completely absurd, I might almost believe it Keep on going Dr. Simon. time traveler, please... Does that say... What I think it says. Jesus. It says Jesus. And the home.... What was that? Shit!. The infrared lamp, dammit! Was the paper damaged? No, but I'm afraid we have another problem. We have to get a new infrared lamp from Tel Aviv. Strange, I just changed it not long ago. That's really spooky. Maybe one of your aliens did it. Yah,....Maybe. Could you tell me where I might find professor Willfort? What's going on? I don't see why that's any of your business son. May I? Sorry, but lets... Consider for a moment the idea that it really could be a time traveler who's skeleton was found. I admire your persistence. No, wait, just hear me out for a minute. Why would,... someone... travel with a video camera 2000 years back in history? To film Jesus Christ. Do you really think he video taped Jesus Christ? Yes! Fascinating idea. Dr. Simon, I beg you. Don't you do start with this time traveler nonsense. No, no, no, Im not so sure it really is nonsense. I'm looking at the facts here. Facts, what facts? I would rather believe that our radio carbon analysis failed than think that we're dealing with a time traveler. It's so absurd! Let's just consider the idea that the time traveler did exist. Someone who filmed Jesus. Wouldn't you think he would want to return his recordings to the press? Yes! Absolutely he would, yes. But maybe he couldn't. For some unknown reason. The new infrared lamp is on its way. It will take another two hours though before it arrives from Tel Aviv. Very good. Thank's Joshua. Who are all these people professor? Are you holding a press conference? Mr. Kaun. What are you doing here? You called me yesterday, remember? I thought you were in Detroit! Yes, and now I'm here. I thought I was very clear and specific when I spoke to you. I told you not to tell anyone not a soul about these findings. I'm sorry, but these are my colleagues. Everyone? What do they do? That's Roland, my assisstant. Dr. Simon head of the Institute. That's his assistant. And this is Steffen Vogt, who discover the grave site. Gentlemen, I thank you for all your help. But the two of you aren't needed anymore. Thanks again. One moment. Steffen, one moment I will accompany you outside. Just a moment. What is this? Professor, I don't understand. We only need a few more hours to decide the rest of the letter. Please Steffen You heard what Mr. Kaun just said, right? I don't have the power to change any of this. But, who is he that he can make up these decisions for us? Well he's the one who finances the excavations. My work, ehe technical equipment we're using. Everything! Basically that makes us his employee. Yah but, why does he do that? I mean It really doesn't appear as if he likes archeology that much. You know what Steffen, I'll make you a proposal. Just treat yourself to a relaxing day in Jerusalem. Or you can go and take a nap at the hotel It's already been paid for anyway. But tomorrow morning, you can take a bus back to the archeology site, see? That's all I can do for you for the moment. That's just great. Just super. Are you kidding me? The letter says that a time traveler took a video of Jesus Christ when he went back? No, not exactly. But do you know what I have in front of me right now? No, So why don't you just tell me. The instruction manual we found at the grave was for a Sony IP 270 E. I'm on the Internet right now Searching the Sony home page for the camera. Now guess what I found? What is this a guessing game? Dude, just tell me. The Sony IP 270 E only exists in a blueprint at the moment. Wait, what do you mean a blueprint? The camera doesn't exist yet The earliest it will be on the market will be in 3 years. It's a video camera that will record directly on to a hard drive. That means? That means That means our skeleton has to be a time traveler. I mean, he had an instruction manual with him for a video camera model that doesn't exits yet. What now? What are you going to do? I don't know yet. But I have got to get that letter again. That's the only lead I have. I would think that our time traveler was hiding the camera in a place where he could be sure it would be safe for the next 2,000 years. I'm sure there is a hint in that letter. So I have to find it. Well, there's only one problem. Well the guy just told you to leave. Yah so what, it was me. It was me who found the letter. If there is a video somewhere with the recordings of Jesus then we can't let this guy find it first. I'm sure you understand. What's going on with you? Did you suddenly become religeous? No, bullshit. Just think about it dude. What if Jesus didn't live the way the church has been telling us for the past 2000 years? Maybe he was just a regular guy. Maybe he preached love peace and happiness And isn't happy at all about the church using power in his name. Maybe he was even gay, what do we know? And you are aware of the consequences this discovery could have for humanity. Do you have any idea? Gentlemen! Gentlemen, I beg you! Gentlemen...., I am well aware of the urgency of the situation. But I do think we should remain calm here. Until we get an offical confirmation of the information we've received. If we are hesitant... We will suffer... terrible consequences We have to act now. No Father. I won't inform the Holy Father at this point. Excuse me, gentlemen. Well? Nothing. They aren't willing to impose any sanctions. What else did you expect? I guess we'll have to take matters into our own hands. You should look at this. It will prove to you the urgency to take action right now. I have to warn you Considering all the different interests groups. We'll have to be prepared for anything. Don't worry, I've taken all the necessary precautions. [Image of the word "Jesus"]. Israel, the Holy Land. Jerusalem, a city in which three religions meet one another The place where Jesus died with the Dome of the Rock One of the major sanctuaries of the Muslim world. ..and the Wailing Walls, The holiest place in the Jewish religeon The Wailing wall, is part of the west wall. Laboratory Ryan? Ryan? What's going on? Do you have sneak around? Can't you just sit in one room? Be quiet, and leave me alone? You make me nervous. You do your work, I'll do mine. Nervous? Pussy. Jesus really lived. Shit! Thank God.. Ryan? Ryan? There's somebody inside. I saw their shadow. Could you recognize who he was? No. But that shouldn't be a problem. Jesus didn't exist. When I arrived I couldn't remember much... In my desperation... It came... occured to me that... Jesus was never alive... was it desinty... that shows me to... just to take his seat. Damn. No hints about the place. Was it destiny that chose me to take his seat? Damn. Hello? Where is it? Back there, that's where he is. Shoot at his legs. That way. Who the hell could that be? Who is it? It's, it's me. Who is me? Steffen Vogt. The guy from the excavation site. You saved my life. The Cobra, remember? Listen to me Sharon, You have to help me. Sure I can help you, it's 4 o'Clock in the morning. I'll call the police right now. Sure you can do that, but first let me in. I feel terrible. I feel desperate, I swear. Ok, just walk back a few steps. To the middle of the street where I can see you. I can't.... I haven't got any... Move to the street. OK, I'm going. Are you going to shoot me? Or can I come in? If you're trying to hit on me, forget it. Why for Christ's sake did you come here? Well... Dan in still at the excavation site and I don't know anyone else in Jerusalem. By the way, is all Israeli women armed? All the women in Israel have to join the army. I'm reservist. Your boy friend's stuff? If you're at the institute, you must have met him. His name is Joshua. So that's your boyfriend? He's a nice guy. And you don't know the guys who attacked you? No But I imagine it must have been that Kaun fellow's people. I believe he thinks that I stole something from him. Who would be stupid enough to break into the museum? It's your own fault. I locked myself in. I didn't break into it. Even if you didn't break in, you were still trespassing. Would you like some coffee? No, have you got anything with alcohol? I've got beer. By the way, how did you know my address? I got it from Dan. From Dan? I see. So tell me... Do you get all the addresses of the women you meet? Just in case? No. Only when I'm contemplating the notion of breaking into to her house to put red roses next to her bed. Anyway, before you go into town with Kaun and Willfort again. You should talk to the police. Like tomorrow morning. And..., you can sleep in the living room. And I'll warn you, if you get even close to my bedroom, with or without roses. I'm going to shoot you. Hello sir.... Hello. Excuse me. My name is Steffen Vogt, I'm in room 307 I'd like to talk to the hotel manager. That would be me. How can I help you sir? It's about an assault. I was attacked into my room yesterday. Security different tell me of anything special last night. Nothing special? That's funny! Seems to be all right. Voil?. That's not possible. The copies. I don't understand. Is this really my room here? Room 307. My passport. My passport is gone. Your passport? Perhaps you put it in the safe. No! I clearly remember putting it in this pouch. Nothing. I told your early. There was someone else in here. Is this the window, you jumped off from? I don't think there is much more I can do for you. And you better file a police report regarding your passport. Yes, I will. You can be sure of that. Excuse me, I'm not sure that you understood me. This isn't just another case of another tourist getting robbed. Can you identify yourself? No! For the tenth time. They tried to grab my leg while I was trying to escape through the window. They even shot at me. And are you sure of that? Yes, I am very sure of it, because I was there. Have you have been in the Arab section of the city? No, that happen two streets from here, at the hotel. Excuse me for a moment. I'll be back in a minute. What's going on? Mr. Vogt?....Yah? Would you please follow me? Another department will take care of your case. We have to go to another office. No problem. Mr. Vogt, please follow me that way. You know what? I think I've changed my mind about filing a police report. Maybe I just over reacted a bit about the whole thing. And I'm sorry about that. I think it might be better if I just leave now. If you think so but please understand you'll still have to file a report about the incident. It's for our files. Please follow me. What department you work for? Pardon me? Didn't you say you working for a different department? I'd like to know which one. This way please. Will this take a long time? I have a commitment and I told my friends I'd be back very soon. Don't worry about it It's just some paper work. In here Mr. Vogt. What's wrong? You mind if I smoke? You can also do that in here. Yah, but I'd like to smoke out here. Do I know you?...Steffen Vogt. Stop now! You let him go of him! Don't move! Don't be stupid! [Shouting and arguing] He's going out the back. Hurry, open up. The door, is only a purpose exit. You won't get out of here. Emergency? Alright, we'll see about that! You'll never get out of here. Sorry. Hey hey hey, get out of here, that's my car! Hey, asshole! No, the thumper usually works like an ultrasound for the earth. It reflects the sound waves from each vibration or quake into the computer... where they are put together into a picture That sounds very impressive, how big is the vibration? Not bigger than a small earthquake. like the ones we've experience every couple of months in Israel. No problem. Uh huh, So what are we looking for? I have no clue. The only thing I know is that yesterday we were still in Bethlehem. They ordered us to leave the excavation site. Excuse me Peter, but don't you have work to do? Sorry Mr. Kaun, I'll be right back. We're sorry It wasn't our intention to keep him away from work. We only wondering why is this all being done here? I think you'll find that out soon enough. Peter, we're ready for the first cycle. OK, I'll start right away. What do you think they're looking for with that instrument? I wish I knew. Hello? Professor Willfort? It's me, Stephen Vogt. Steffen, where the hell are you? In Jerusalem, listen to me. Come back here immediately. Why, what's going on? What's going on? You know very well what's going on! You stole the second half of the letter from us, and apparently it's the most important part. I didn't steal anything from you, I only uh... Please Steffen, stop it. I'm watching the surveillance camera right now. Don't even try to lie to me. Kaun already has his people looking for you, and if you don't come here immediately voluntarily, you're going to be in serious trouble. Serious trouble? Now you listen to me, I only made copies of the computer prints because I wanted to know what the letter said. I didn't steal absolutely anything. Professor, that Kaun guy is really dangerous. Listen, someone is after me, they shot at me. Stop making up stories? I don't know what is happened to you. Bring us the letter immediately or I won't be able to do anything for you. Operator, how can I help you? American Embassy please. Please hold I'll put you through. American Embassy Burkman. Yes hello, my name is Steffen Vogt. I'm calling because I need a provisional passport in order to fly to Germany. It's urgent because I lost my original passport... Wait, Vogt, did you say Vogt? Yes I did. I'm glad you're calling Mr. Vogt We tried to reach you and couldn't get hold of you. The Israeli authorities have asked about you. It seems you're in serious trouble. I know I'm in serious trouble. That's the reason I need the passport. They're after me. I'm afraid it's not that easy. Where are you at the moment? We'll pick you up. That's not necessary, I can get to you. If I just understood you correctly, you need our help, am I right? Please stay where you are we'll be there right away. Thank you. But there's something I have to do first. Thank you. [Phone ringing] Somehow, I get the feelling you have a complex about someone following you. First the hotel, then the police. Now the embassy, professor Willfort. They all got together to create a conspiracy against you and are out to get you. I mean don't you think it's a bit too much Doctor Kimble? Doctor?....... Sharon, I know this sounds a bit wierd, and unbelievable. Yah, a bit? Well go ahead if you can give me a better explanation? Yes I can, you're just paranoid. That's pretty clear isn't it? That's my car over there. Just a sec, I have to get money from the ATM. I guess I should take out as much as possible. Whatever you think. See, look there. What? There's more proof, read. We have to retain your card. Please call your bank during regular business hours. So what? That doesn't mean anything. Except that your broke and paranoid. That's so funny. You're very funny. Do you think I could use your phone please?. Who are you calling? Someone in Germany? I've tried that already, and couldn't get a hold of anyone. Who are you calling? Dan, he knows everyone. I have no clue what's going on here. There this guy Thumper I told you about. And they searched all our belongings. Now they won't let anyone closer than 150 feet from the excavation site. You know buddy, after you broke into the museum and the whole drama with the police I think it'll be extrememly difficult to find for anyone who'll believe you. Yah, but Dan, this is clear as daylight Someone has taken advantage of the situation and stolen the second half of the letter. and now they're trying to blame it on me. Oh, I almost forgot, then there's the story about your Jesus video and a time traveler. Everyone will think your a wacko and I'll have to admit my contacts aren't good at influencing the local police. Well I thought that maybe you'd knew somebody with the press. I think it's important it became public. Then it'll be harder for them to catch me. Well..., I know a guy who works for one of the networks. He's always looking to get a good story. He also works for one of those papers or..what do they call it, well like a magazine. That sounds perfect. Tell me where I can find this guy. So then, you go in first and check out if everything's clear. Dan said that he'll be sitting with the journalist in the corner. You just pass them, and if he whistles at you that means the sign is the coast is clear. Then you will walk out on the patio and take the back street back to me. Got it? Yes sir mister paranoia. And what if he doesn't whistle? That means something's wrong. In that case, you walk out on the patio. you have a cup of coffee come back out and leave. Then I'll follow you, OK? Uh huh Oh my God, let me take you to the hospital. How's Dan? We have to leave...now! Let's get in the car, hurry up! What did he say? That someone killed Dan. That they're looking for a female eye witness. They want to talk to her. I shouldn't have made him a part of all this. How could you've know what was going to happen? But he'd still be alive if I hadn't called him. Steffen, you're a Christian aren't you? Well yes, I was brought up a Christian. But I haven't been to church in a long time. Don't you believe in Jesus or in God? Do you believe in Mary Poppins? What's your point? Who is Mary Poppins? Forget about it, I'm Sorry. So in your mind, does God exist? No. And If he does, it doesn't seem he's very interested on what's going on down here on earth does it. I can't answer that queston as a Christian, but in Judaism, they say that... Joshua, please. Anyone care for something to drink? Water? Yah, thanks. I think we should go to the hospital. You really need some stitches. No, they'll find me at the hospital. But, you can't hide for the rest of your life. I don't know what to do. The best thing would to to find the camera and the video tape first. They must think I have them or know where they are. Where would we start looking for them? And if we found them, what would we do with them? Then we just go public with it. I'll definetly won't let Kaun or any of those disgusting pigs who killed Dan have the pleasure of getting their hands on the tape. Who knows what they would do with it. They'd probably sell it. Ow! I'm Sorry. Don't worry, you did a good job. Thank you. And for someone who's not use to it, you're very brave yourself. I'm just pretending to.... ..make a good impression. Well, that's pretty much just about everything nurse Sharon can do for you. Thanks. I have to meet with my mother to buy a bar mitzvah gift. Yes, I almost forgot about that. I'll walk you to the car. Sure Your behaviour has been worrying some people. They're asking too many questions. Extraordinary situations require extraordinary measures. Your worried friends surely won't like anyone to overtake us. How reliable is the information from your source? So reliable that I can assure we have no other choice. Then do what has to be done. And stop bothering me details. Bring me results. And don't forget, if something goes wrong, you're on your own. Do you have a cigarette I can have? Sorry, it's my last one. Joshua, just because I like Sharon, it doesn't mean... What? What doesn't it mean? Sharon is my girlfriend. If you want something from her, we'll have a problem. OK! When I met Sharon I didn't know she had a boyfriend. And when she told me, it's true I wasn't too happy about it. Nevertheless, I'm not the kind of guy that would hit of a friend's girlfriend. Who said that we're friends? You don't know me. That's the way I see it, people who hide me from killers in their flats are automatically my friends rather they like it or not, alright? Come on. You are an unusual guy, I hope you know that. And you have a wonderful woman, I hope you know that as well. Take care of her. And what are you going to do now? What's going to happen? The problem is that the second part of the letter seems to have been stolen. And it's the part that says where the camera is. Without that part, we have no chance. Wait a minute. I have an idea. Where are you going? To the Institute. Why? Stephen will explain, I have to go. Why is Joshua going to the institute? He's trying to get the instructions for the camera. What? But why? Well, the paper that disapeared was stuck to the back of it for 2000 years. Yah, and? It's possible that the ink from the letter left traces, and in that case, we could try to make them visible again. But don't you think now that there's now even more security at the institute? Yah, but they won't be watching the instruction book there's nothing of interest. Joshua thinks it's by now, they're filed in the library. What's your plan, should he just walk in and take it? What if he gets caught? Look, I specifically asked him whether he wanted to do this. He said that the only problem would be the surveillance camera, and the rest would be easy. Would it be easy, maybe for someone else but certainly not for Joshua. He gets nervous when he parks his car illegally. He's only doing this to be a hero. Joshua, what are you doing there? I just wanted to refill the solution. But I already did that 10 minutes ago. Can't you tell? Yah, of course, I can. You've been acting a little strange lately. Are you out of your mind coming here, what if someone sees you? It's alright, I was just afraid that you might get caught. And, did you get the Instructions? Sure, not a problem. Um, I think we can go directly to the University. You have access to the laboratory? Yah, I already told them you were coming. I'll take my car and catch up with you there. Nothing, absolutely nothing. If there is any residue, it's too faint. Do you have anyway to make that residue visible? Something to reinforce them, something chemical? Yes there is. We can treat the paper with Magnesium dioxide. But the method is risky. Normally we do exhaustive test to determine the concentration, so that the reside remains in good condition. How long will that take? In this laboratory like this one, two weeks. Forget it, we don't have that much time. Why don't we take the chance and use the concentration that you think may be right? That's too risky. Is there another possibility? I really can't promise anything. You're asking me to make 2000 year old ink visible on paper that's contemporary. I haven't any reference for something like that for the exact concentration. Yah yah, you can do it if haven't any other option. Can we help you somehow? Yes, you can get me some coffee, make it strong. Do you think he can do it? He might. Is that your girlfriend? No, that's my sister. She's very pretty, what does she do? She's dead. I'm very Sorry. That's ok, it was quiet a while ago. What happened? It was a car accident. She was out with my parents. And I didn't want to go with them, because..... I planned on going on vacation with some of my buddies. It would have been my first vacation by myself. My parents weren't happy about it at all, they thought uh..... it's too dangerous, well... And they were all killed? Yah. I'm so sorry. My brother died when I was 12. At war in Lebanon. It was a bullet from another Israeli. Friendly fire. After that had happened, I wonder... I mean how, how can you still believe that God exists? I don't know. Somehow I think he's always with me. That gives me strength. I'm happy for you. Alright, let's see what we've got. Do you think it's working? I hope so. That's it, you did it. Here, wait. Only now, at the end of my life... I understand that... It was the best that could ever happen to me. I found what I was always searching for. What? Come on keep reading. Yah, wait wait wait. His wife, he only found his wife? What do you mean only? That's great. You're right! Except, she's not around. What? Never mind. The love of my life. The fulfilment that made all the sacrifices worth living. I couldn't have said it better. Go on, what else? There's nothing here. Here we go. Although I had to change the hideout. I still hoped that my voyage was not in vain. That someone... will find this video tape... some day. The guy actually made a video, and then he hid it. Let's see if on the paper it says where. Come on, go on! That's where it ends. Well go up, check, check the beginning again. Let's see if there's something else. OK. There is something. But then I arrived in a region... where I was told... that a man had been found... by the name of Jesus. A prophet! That means that Jesus was not the time traveler after all. That would be too easy. OK, there is nothing here. Shit! There is only one tiny bit left. Then we're back at the beginning. So if there's nothin here, then that's it. Here. I knew that the Sermon on the Mount was going to take place. Wait, what's that? L-15-4. 4... oh shit! That's it, we're back at the beginning. Only now, at the end of my life ... But that couldn't be all, that couldn't be in vain he said that the video was hidden, it should say where. Yes, but they're probably some kind of coordinates. L-15-4U. Coordinates of what? Back then they didn't have longitude or latitude. So what else could he have used for orientation? Don't know, how about the stars? I think We should do a scientific analysis of that, or better yet a cartography. Yah, but not today please, it's already late. Steffen, Joshua and I have to go to his nephew's bar mitzvah now. We, will be back as soon as possible. I shouldn't take more than 2 hours, ok? Yah, no problem. Let's meet at your place. Help me! Anyone please help me! Where is it? The camera? I don't know where the camera is. I have no idea. Is that right? No,..no...no... Stand up. Who the hell are you? Later. May I? Where are you taking me? To the German Embassy. Why not the American? I'm American. We could if you'd like, but they're bugged everywhere. By the Israeli's, by the Russian's and by us as well. And who is us? You'd better not ask. It would take hours and hours to tell you it was CIA and SA and army bullshit. I'm a friend, that should be enough for now. Just call me Christopher. OK, Christopher... What does all that mean? By now, you should have a clue about all that. Just tell me where the camera and video tape are hidden. The one of Jesus Christ? Yes of course, you have no idea the turmoil that find has caused. Pretty much every in Israel is searching for you now. And who tried to kill me? We think Mr. Kaun, the financier is behind the whole thing. He can buy power with all his money, and that you stole something from him. But to be quite honest, he didn't plan on killing you right away. Not until you finally returned the letter safely to him. Tell me Steffen, where's the camera? I really dont know. Steffen, what did the letter say? Where is it? I don't have it. But I have something else. The stolen paper made an impression on top of the instruction booklet. With some work, we're able to recover it, and make it visible. But it only says that the time traveler made some recording with a camera. But doesn't say where the camera is hidden. And the second part of the letter got destroyed. It appears that we weren't lucky and that all the information is lost. Come on, it didn't say anything, there's no clue where the hiding place is? Yah, there were a few numbers. 11-15-4U. Could be coordinates. Just a minute, where are we? That's no way to the embassy. Where are you taking me? What are we doing here? What's going on here? But you killed that man! This can't be possibe. Hey, Christopher, hey! Let go of me. He didn't say anything. Shit...shit...shit Don't be afraid Steffen. You don't have to be scared. Scared? Why would I be scared? I'm tied up to a chair, naked, and you're going to kill me just like you killed my friend Dan, so? Why would I be scared? A sense of humour. You know I like people who have a sense of humour. What did you inject me with? Everything will be alright. We only have a few questions. Questions? What kind of questions? You know everything already! We have to be completely sure. OK! Let's start, just ask me. Here is question number one. Did you take the video tape from the cave? What? Uh...oh the camera. You see it's a camera that records on an integrated hard drive. You see, there..... there really is no tape. Just tell us, did you take the camera with you when were at the cave by yourself? No, no, I didn't take anything out of the cave. I handed everything to Professor Willfort. I told you that I don't like this stuff. What do you want now? I promissed earlier that I would tell you everything. It's only an EKG to be sure... that you don't just die here. I'm going to make sure you don't die before you tell us everything you know. Oh God. Do you still believe that I'm hiding any secrets from you? Are you under the impression that I'm Superman? You talk when I ask you to. So my friend. You say the video camera is not in your posession, that you don't know where she is and you didn't sell your knowledge to anyone? How would I be able to sell something I don't even have? Honestly, .....you don't have to hurt me. If you like, I can tell you what was written on the second part of the letter. That's not necessary, we have the second part of the letter. You have the letter? But how? For the last time, who has the camera? I really don't know. And what about those numbers and coordinates? What do they mean? I have no idea. They probably show the... the path to that bloody camera with that shitty shitty video tape of that.. that shitty Jesus Christ, what do I know?! What did you say? I want to know what you just said? What I said? Repeat! I don't know, no idea. What did I just say? Cursed are those whose use in vain the name of the Lord. Don't lose sight of the one that forgives your sins and who gives us the power to love. And who is also there to judge and ultimately punish the ones who are not worthy to live as a creature of God. They shall burn those who don't serve God. But praised are those who teach and pass on the true lessons of God. With grand words and with determination. To praise our Lord Jesus Christ. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to offend you. Do you think he knows anything else? We'll soon see. I'll do anything you want. Please, get me to the airport. And I'll be gone. But I've told you everything I know, I swear. Maybe all this is,... just a big waste of our time. I don't think so. Continue with it. Steffen, listen to me. You could've stopped this already. Why don't you help yourself and just tell us the meaning of those numbers. If not, this will only be the beginning. I do not know what they mean, believe me. Steffen... You don't mind me calling you with your first name. Now that we get to know each other. Are you sure that there's nothing else you would like to tell us? Really certain? Yes,....yes. You know what? I believe you. But I'm afraid, it's too late now. Now I want to hear you scream. End of Part One Relic Hunters Part Two ...where's the camera.... Do you think he'll be able to dig in that condition? So far, they've all been able to dig. Thank God. It's still there. It's all still there, it's all still there. Right over there is good. Hey. Hey!! Hey man, what's going on? I had an accident, are you heading to Jarusalem? Shit, you look really bad. Yah. Get in You want a hit? Yah, why not, let's go...please. Thank you. Your thinking about him? Of course I am. I mean.... I know you think about him. But do you think of him as someone you love? I don't know Joshua. We talked about marriage. Do we have to talk about that right now? Steffen could be dead. Steffen is down there in the streets, come on. Oh my God Steffen, what did they do to you? Let me call an ambulance. No, no you better not. Come on, let's get him upstairs. A friend of my father's is a doctor. Monseigneur We, we had a problem with the job at the desert. I already know. We'll take care of him later. What...what did he say? Will I still be... able to.... you know? Don't worry, he said all your body parts are still working fine. They're only flesh wounds. In my opinion, they just tried to scare you. Well, they did a good job. Did they show up at your place? When we got back to the apartment, the place was a wreck. It appears they were looking for something. I called all hospitals in the area. How long was I gone? Two days and two nights. It felt like two weeks. Now what? I think the only way to end all this is to find the camera and the video tape before they do. Then what are we going to do with the video? Hey!! We could post the story on the net. And send it as a mass email to everyone we know. If everyone knows about it, there'll no longer be of any interest to those guys. Let me remind you, that we haven't found it yet and the clues weren't really clear to me. I'm sure we'll figure...something out. Wow, what is that stuff? We gotta...we gotta read the letter again. That has to have a clue. About the hiding....... Those numbers 15 and 4. Maybe they aren't coordinates after all. Maybe it's from the Bible. Like Luke 15 chapter 4 for example. And maybe that's where we'll find a clue to where the camera's been hidden. And what kind of clue might they be? I don't know. But it's the only thing I can think of at the moment. Nothing. A passage from the Bible Luke 15 4 does not exist. Isn't there another.... version of the Bible with different numbering for the chapters that might help us out? Do I look like a priest? Hey, wait a minute, what's this? Did you find something? Here, look at this? One of the guys had this symbol on his ring. Which guy did? One of the ones who tortured me. He must belong to one of these secret orders. Let's see...uh.. Here, The Holy Inquisition. They call themselves the Lukrenians...uh... Do me a favour and translate this for me. I was never very good at Latin. Don't they teach you Latin in the U.S. when you study archeology? Yah, but sometimes you have to establish priorities. Here, the Lukanian Order is the direct successor of the Holy Inquisition. After it was forbidden in the middle of the 19th century, this secret society was founded. The members also called themselves the Army of God. The successors of the Holy Inquisition. Oh man, nothing ever surprises me anymore. And we haven't gotten any closer to the hiding place either. Half the places mentioned in this letter are probably destroyed. It's just a guessing game anyway. Give me the prints again. please. Thank you. Yah, you're a genius! What is it? You said it was a guessing game. All we did was make the wrong guesses. What we read was... I knew that the Sermon on the Mountain was going to take place. Yah, and? It could also be read like this. I know that Mount Zion would remain intact. Right? What do you think? Logical, what remains intact on Mount Zion? The Wailing Wall. That's right. The Wailing Wall of the old temple is one of the few buildings that the time traveler could have known would still exist 2000 years later. And what about the numbers? L 15 4U. Who knows, they might actually be coordinates. One moment. OK, let's see. The fifteenth stone fell left from the fourth lower row. Fourth lower row...well It has to be behind that stone there. Dammit, the fourth lower row is approximately 20 metres underneath us. What? Yah, the Wailing Wall was filled up over and over again during the last centuries. The city was destroyed, rebuilt, redestroyed. That means, that the wailing wall that was here 2000 years ago the lower part of the temple is approximately 20 meters underground. Hey.....what's going on? That's Kaun. I thought they didn't have the letter anymore. How were they able to find out about the Wailing Wall? And what kind of machine is that? I think that's the thumper that Dan talked about. Let's get a better look. What are they doing? I'm not sure, but I think there's a computer inside that's able to record the findings. I think the Thumper is scanning parts of the underground area. It looks like they think the camera is here too. But, they must have better equipment. Plus they must have connections in high places. It's almost imposible to get a permit for something like that. Somehow, we have to get that data from the Thumper scan. You don't think that will be easy? Yah, there are soldiers everywhere. I think we should forget about it. Joshua what we need right now is a little optimism, OK? Hey, I've got an idea, look over there, look. SAFETY REGULATIONS: DONT LEAVE LUGGAGE UNATTENDED. Let's try it, I'm in.. Do you think this is going to work? I'm sure it will work. In Jerusalem, they panic when they see an empty cigarette pack lying around unattended. All you have to do is walk through confidently. What we need Steffen is a little more optimism. You're right, let's go. Hey hold on, open it. Attention, bomb alert! Back pack, who's backpack is this?! Whose backpack is this?! Attention! Are you ready to go? No, but I don't have much choice. Dammit, what's going on here? Open, open up right now, that's an order. There's a bomb alarm. What is that, what's going on here? There's a bomb alarm. We have to secure the site immediately, everybody out now. We have to secure the site immediately, everybody out now! I would like to speak to your supervisor. Why should we get out, we can drive away. The thumper is finished. Hey, excuse me! Hey, get out of there, come on. Come on, go. Come on come on, Go go go go go.... Who's driving? A soldier, stay where you are, I'm warning you. Shit, this wasn't part of the plan. If I were you, I would not do that. You, hand me his gun. And do it slowly. Sit down! Sit down! Maybe you could aim at something else. That thing might go off That would be your problem, not mine. Just stay where you are, everything's OK. Sharon, everything all right? What are you doing, I thought we only needed the printout. I'm sorry, I didn't have any other choice. What are we going to do with them? It's simple, we throw them all out. Except Kaun, he can stay. Aren't you Steffen Vogt? Tell me what's going on here? No. Another announcement, Plan B. Everyone out of the truck now. Except you, hurry up And the cell phone stays here. Hurry up, go on, go go go. Move over there. Hurry up, go on. You stay here I said move further back. You stay here. Just keep going. Keep going Go back to the front and hit the gas. I said stay back. We have to get out of here right now. Understood. Where are they? Yes? Joshua, where are you? Me? Where are you? I can't explain it to you at the moment. Take the same route that we usually take when going to Varden OK? Once you pass the gas station. You take the first exit and keep going towards the south. There's only one road. OK, see you there. Hey stop, stop please, stop. Hey, take us with you. Take us with you, stop. Greetings to you gentlemen on this fine day You look like you need a ride. Special price, inexpensive today just for you. Where have you been all this time? My men have been looking for you for a week. So it looks like you have finally found me Mr. Kaun. Listen, can we talk to each other like civilized men? Civilized? yah sure. Civilized as your friends from the Lukanian order right? What do you mean? I don't have any friends from any order. Then why did you try and get me at the telephone booth. Look, do me a favour and don't play off so innocent OK? Tell me what you know and do it slowly, because I don't know much about guns, who knows when this thing might go off. So tell me, how did you get there so quickly? Alright. The German Embassy informed me. What do you mean they informed you? The embassy was bugged. By the CIA, and this time by the Mossad. And Vice versa And with the Mossad, I've someone on the inside. Beside from that, I didn't need anything else since my men couldn't find you. And what did your men want from me? To talk about archeology? You stole something from me, in case you forgot, the second part of the letter. We don't have the letter. And why would it be your letter? Just because you finance the excavations, doesn't mean the entire country of Israel belongs to you. I'm not claiming everything. Only what is anything to do with the time traveler. Since it's going to be me who sends him. My firm. Can I show you something? OK, but slowly, and no tricks. Well I'm not a scientist. But I'll try to explain it as simply as I can. To begin with, it is possible to time travel. But there's one huge problem. Let's imagine for a moment that we want to send an object back an hour into the past. Now the Earth is spinning, and at a considerable speed. So what happens? Our object ends up somewhere in space. So... What you are about to see, is the first attempt to send an object 4 seconds back into the past. At the interval of 4 seconds. The movement of the earth can still be calculated. Now pay attention to to the right side. Next to the machine. Exactly 4 seconds before the starting the experiment. The apple will have reached it's destinaton. and to traveling into the past. Wow. It was already there before you started with the experiment. It's the premise for time travel. The apple travelled 4 seconds to the past, and arrives before the experiment is started. Fascinating isn't it. Now, I'll run the tape a little further. This was two weeks ago.. shortly before we got the news about your findings here in Israel. Alright. This is the first experiment with a living organism. Again, this is a 4 second trip into the past. Unfortunate the rat moved, which is why the scanner didn't work properly. But our technician reacted quickly. He was so shocked that he didn't even start the experiment. How is that possible? When we just saw it happen. It seems that there was a time paradox we had never seen before. Since the rat arrived before the experiment had begun it gave the technician enough time to abort the experiment. But as you saw... the experiment did actually take place, but in a different reality, a possible reality. Who knows So you see, this is possibly how some of the unexplained phenomena occur like visions or ghosts people who suddenly disappear, who knows.. So you sent a man 2000 years in the past to record Jesus Christ? Not today, nor tomorrow, but in the near future. And so you're trying to tell me you had absolutely nothing to do with all this? So what about what Dan Abraham? Who killed him? Who is Dan Abraham? Joshua! Why did you just leave without me? I've been searching the entire country for you. Hi, we have to leave. After what happened at the Wailing Wall, I'm sure they're looking everywhere for this truck. By the way, what did you find at the Wailing Wall? We don't know yet, the results haven't been evaluated. Good, let's go then. Hey hey hey hey Hey, at least leave me my phone. Dammit, this isn't funny! Mr. Kaun, you're very important, aren't you? I'm sure your men will find you out here. You believed him? I'm not sure. I don't think he's telling us everything. Maybe he only suspected that you had the video in your possession. Someone bring me up to speed, what's going on. Take a look here. We need someone to help us. I know someone. Who is it? Professor Willfort. Forget about him Willfort is mad at me, besides, he might have something to do with all this. I don't think he works for the people who tortured you. What makes you so sure about that? You said that Christopher knew the contents of the letter right? Kaun was convinced that you took the letter from him. And Willfort working for Kaun. Yah, makes sense. And since I don't have a better idea. I guess, we'll have to trust him. What are you doing here? Where have you been? It's a very long story Professor. And before you start saying that I stole your letter. It wasn't me. And Why should I believe you? You scared me, who are you? I'm... I'm terribly sorry. Dan Abraham was a good boy. So now... What is it you want from me? We would like you to answer a few questions for us. John Kaun Kaun finances everything here. That's all? At least until last week, that's what I thought. But when you came to me about your time traveler idea. I thought all of that was insane. But i'm afraid, I owe you an apology. But Kaun told you about the time traveler. So then why is he searching here? It's a very strange and complicated story. An excavation was done here during the nineteen thirties. Two years ago, one of Kaun's men met by chance.. with a professor of the archaeological institute of Cambridge. He gave him something. It was something he excavated here back then. [JKE John Kaun Enterprises] JK Enterprises? JK....John Kaun But remember, during the nineteen thirties they weren't manufacturing these kinds of pens. Do you know what I hate about people like you who's religeon is science? You do everything that's possible for you to do. You research, develope... And all of this without considering the consequences. You set a stone in motion without worrying about the valley where the avalanche runs. Let's pretend that Jesus did live, and we can see that on this video. And What if he didn't live? Would the west collapse under the chaos? Would it disprove the Ten Commandments? Violence everywhere? Have you thought about any of that Mr. Kaun? I'm not talking one body here or there. Or even a few dozen. I'm talking about the whole of humanity. That video is like a weapon Mr. Kaun. A very powerful weapon. I wonder if you have enough authority to possess such a weapon. Whether you have the moral authority or the faith. Do you? We both know you don't have any of these characteristics. Therefore you don't have the right to make it public. To avoid this, I'm going to have to kill you. Amen. May I say something? I do want to solve one of the biggest enigma's of humanity. But I need money to do this. Much more money than I posses. You can be sure of that. Therefore I will make you a proposal. I will sell the tapes.... To you, the church, to the Vatican, for whom ever. I don't think you are in any position to offer me a deal at the moment Mr. Kaun. What if I decide to kill you? Then those video recordings wouldn't have ever happened, and no one will ever know. But the video exists. That means you're not going to kill me. Besides, let's be honest... We both know that you want the video. But what did you call it? Weapon? This is the reason why we're here. Always at the worst possible moment. What is that? The printout from the Thumper at the Wailing Wall. But, we don't know what to do with it. One moment. The fourth lower row should be this one. How many metres did you say? 15 metres from the eastern end. That should be.... yes, here, right here. And you can tell the camera's down there? You can really identity it? No no, you would only see the camera if you were in a massive metal box or something of that kind. I have to say this is the most intelligent way of preserving it for so long. And what's this here? That's a tunnel. Part of Jerusalem's old sewage system. The entire old city is loaded with them. An immense labyrinth. So does this mean that this tunnel leads to the hiding place of the camera?" Yes. Strange isn't it? But it certainly looks that way. I think I have some maps that show the old tunnel. This map should have the entire sewer system here. But it looks like, unfortunately it doesn't include the part of the system that we need. Can any of you scuba dive? So why? Most of these tunnels nowadays, are located under water. Especially the one we're looking for. Well, I wouldn't say that I'm an expert. But I did take a course once... but that was uh... What was that? It was probably an animal. Yah maybe. Well I guess we should meet tomorrow at 10am. at the corner of Bek-Raeon and Kotamia You find the scuba diving equipment, and I'll find the flat. Professor Willfort? Rolland, what are you doing out here? We made an incredible discovery earlier this morning and I thought that you should know as soon as possible. I'm warning you don't waste my time with any of your foolishness. I'm quite busy. No, I'm sorrry Professor. But I really think this will be of interest to you. Just take a look in there. Where's Professor Willfort? He couldn't come. But he filled me in on everything. Kaun showed up at the camp earlier, he needed to speak to Professor Willfort regarding the Thumper map. Wait a minute, you mean Kaun has a map too? Yah, I think it was still saved on the hard drive of the computer, but Willfort wil try and keep him there. Do you have the diving gear? Yah, It's all there. Let's go then just follow me, I know where the entrance to the tunnel system is. The important thing is that you don't get caught in the lateral tunnels. Always follow the main tunnel. The system is quite complicated. The oxygen will last about 45 minutes if you breathe slowly. And if you breathe rapidly, it might only last 30 minutes. And if you get lost, you'll be dead. May peace be with you. - Peace be with you - We would like to practice in your well. - Come on. - Thank you. The well be here. Help me. Leave us alone please. It very far, ha ha ha Good luck Yah Thank you. You're welcome Go through the main tunnel, then go east till the end approximately 200 metres, then make a right turn in direction of the wall. This tunnel should lead you right to the wall. And no matter what happens Once you've used half your oxygen you must return immediately I know all this, but how do I find the stone where the camera is? Watch out for signs or anything familiar. Maybe the time traveler made marks. in the rocks or something. Good. Good luck. Be careful. Don't worry, nothing will him happen to Steff. Nothing can kill him. What's that? [cough cough] Gross! Okay. I have to go to the bathroom. Where is that idiot? Should already be on his way back. No! Can't be! Someone's already been here. This can't be true! Another 10 minutes. You can easily get lost down there, I mean, what if he doesn't find his way back? If he get's lost down there, he doesn't have any chance to survive There are miles and miles of... I wouldn't think about doing that again, put it down! Over there, both of you, move! Stop right where you are! Well, it seems your good friend didn't make it. He's five minutes over the limit. If he doesn't show up now. We have to do something, we have to get some help. Even if you wanted to, they would be too late. Okay, I'll be right out. Come on, we have to go, close up the well. We can't do that, we can't just leave. We have to stay here and wait. I told you, we have to leave. Your friend needs a doctor. It's OK, everything's under control. Get.. get in there. What are we going to do we do with them? The boss said to drop them in the desert, together with the guy we have in the trunk. Good. Hey, are you asleep? Wake up man! Steffen, we were afraid you were dead. Yah, that's what I thought too. What happen to him, what happen to him? Roland shot him, he has a bullet in his lung. Where is the closest hospital? Hello, is anyone there? Hey! I'll go get someone. Just hang in there. Sharon will be back soon with some help for you. I can't breathe. Just...Just hold on. Where are you dammit? Come on! Take good care of her. Oh my God. Josh, thanks for everything. You don't have to say anything right now. I can feel that you're sorry. Yah, but you can't stay here. This place isn't safe anymore. Joshua's death is in the news. They'll know his name, which will make it easier for them to find out his address. I won't run away anymore Steffan. I can't. But I can't leave you here. Joshua wouldn't have wanted that. Do you think they're still after us? Yah...I'm very sure of it. They think I probably found the camera during the dive and... that was the reason why I showed up somewhere else. To deceive them. Listen, I know that what happened was terrible. But if they kill you too, it won't help Joshua. Listen Sharon That camera is probably the biggest finding that humanity has ever made. And they'll be after us. And they will end it. Unless we end it first. We don't have the slightest chance. And if we're honest, we have to realize that... that we never had any to begin with. I realize that. And I've thought about what I saw down there. The tunnel that leads to the Wailing Wall, Where the camera was supposed to be. Isn't part of the sewage system. And I really don't think that it's a coincidence. What do you mean? I believe someone had excavated the tunnel. And who ever did that, has the camera. I guess that's it then, what are we going to do? We have to find out who excavated the tunnel. It seems nothing can kill you. That's what Joshua said. When you were driving through the tunnel. But this time, I won't be able to go with you. I'll stay here. You know where to find me. You can always come back. Sharon. Shit! We have to....come here! What happened, what's going on? Those guys, they're already here, and they'll be in the house soon. How can we get out of here? Is there is a fire escape? The only exit is downstairs. Joshua's weapon, where is it? In the closet. OK. Maybe they're in here. Please. Shit! Don't just stand there, we don't have time. We're looking for a sandy coloured Range Rover. License plate 4150816, owner Sharon Duran. We will transmit and search dispatch to the police. Good. Furthermore, I would like to ask you to tap some Italian cell phones for me and get me some information. Let's go in there. We should be safe in there for a few hours. I really hope so. The funeral was today. Yah. I hate to say this but... You wouldn't have been able to go. Yah but still... It would have been too dangerous. He really loved you. Please hold me. Just hold me. Sure. And what makes you think that we'll find out right here who is digging in the tunnels? Because Willfort was here to get the map for the tunnel systems. Maybe the librarian remembers where he was looking. I realize he was here to get the map, but we still don't know who was actually digging. Whoever it was, i'm sure he didn't want the whole world to know. Wait a sec, that's it. What do you mean? Why would you dig a tunnel huh? Because otherwise you can't get to the hiding place without being seen. Yah, and? You have to dig from a place so no one will be able to see you. Got it? So we have to find out what stood at the entrance of the tunnel before it was built. Yup!. Well I think he was uh.. looking right here. Thank you. Yes. Here, that's more or less the spot where the tunnel starts. Are you aware of what stood at this spot 500 years ago? The Church of the Armenian order. The Simeon order. I'll go see what I can find. Good. I think I found something. Yah, what is it? It says something about Armenian monks. They came here to Palestine because of an old legend. What kind of legend? A man from Bessara. Bessara, that was the old name of the place where the excavation site is today. Yah yah, I know, go on. A man from Bessara brought a mirror to the place where Jesus gave his speech. But the mirror... after it reflected the countenance of Jesus, found so much pleasure showing its reflection, that from day day forward, it would only show the face of the Lord. He was hiding the mirror in a safe place to protect it from all its enemies. To make sure that future generations would be able to see the face of the Lord. That means the mirror is the camera. Yes exactly. And they found where it was hidden. The monks were 500 hundred years ahead of us. Well we have to find out is where they hid the mirror. Wait..wait..wait Here...it's an old monastery in the Negev. It was founded about 500 years ago, by some Armenian monks. After their church in Jerusalem was destroyed. Supposedly, that's where they kept their relic. Sharon? What's going on? What up? Before we finish this thing, I... What? Nothing, nothing never mind. Just go on. Drive. Do you really think somebody still lives here? It looks completely abandon. Maybe someone wants us to think that. Oh my God! The blood is still fresh. Oh my God, who could have done such a horrible thing? I have a theory. The Lukanian? Yes. Come one let's go now. No no no. We have to find the camera. I'm sure it's not here anymore. Someone got here before we did. Yah, and they could still be around. Don't move! Are you okay? Yah, I'm starting to get used to it. We have nothing to do with this. Who did this? What did he say? He speaks in heavy arabic dialects, but I think he said the devil. You were right, the Lukanian order. What? I think we should follow him. I'm wondering how he was able to survive all that. I have no idea. Maybe he was hiding somewhere, or maybe they just over-looked him. Wait a minute. What's down there? He said something about every hundred years. They're allowed to see it. He's giving it to you. He says he can't protect it any longer. May I? I'll try to turn it on. We have to connect the camera to some power in a computer. Hope the hard drive survived. Look! We have to leave, hurry up! Go go go go go Go! Where's the monk? No no no no, you can't help him now, stay in here. We have to leave, ok? Go go go go go! OK, let's try this. OK hurry, they'll be back soon. Give me the keys. I can drive. Yah, but I can't shoot. They've already reached the car. Go! In this thing we haven't a got chance. Well with any luck the Israeli army will notice them. Just follow the car, we have to stop them. Shoot the driver. Steffen! Shit! Just hold on. Shoot! Lower! Pull up pull up! Steffen! Did they hit you? No, keep going. Bring that damn car to a stop, I'm warning you. I'm trying my best. I don't think this car is going to make it much longer. Where are we going? Towards Jerusalem. I think it's the right direction. I'll try to keep them off us. Shit! Shit, Sharon. Sharon hold on! I have to go to the hospital right now! Your job was to stop them. Just do your job. Shit.....I don't want to die. You're not going to die. Don't lie to me. We're in the middle of a desert. Come on drink this, drink. Come on. Hey You have to promise something to me OK? You have to keep fighting. You hear me? Otherwise, it would all been for nothing. Joshua's death, Dan, you said it yourself. What I was going to say earlier was.. I know, I know, I love you too. Kiss me.. please. Would you like to witness the moment for which you have struggled so much? Nice and slow. Who knows, maybe you find some comfort in it. That way you'll endure your own end much easier. To be honest, you can thank God you're one of the few who have the privilege to witness this. Historical moment. God? Let me tell you. If there really is a God. He's nothing to do with pigs like yourself. Who knows. The tomb of Christ. That's him. It has to be him. Our Father who art in Heaven. What is this, I don't understand. You?! You're the time traveler? Who's this? Dammit do something! It's the Israeli army. Not a chance. Sharon? Sharon! She is alive! She has to live! Don't you move. She's still alive. Do you have a doctor with you? Is there a doctor? I'm sorry... but the girl is dead. No, no, she's not dead. She can't be dead. She's still alive, I know it. Just do something! She lives, she's in the video. The video, where's the video? It was destroyed. You saw it, what was on it? She's was in it, I saw her. She's going to time travel with me. I don't understand. What are you saying? I need a transfusion. Prepare the EGK, hurry. We're going to time travel. Both of us together. Hurry up. It's not everyday... someone touches his skeleton Do you really believe the man in the video.. was Jesus Christ? Well I, I... a few weeks ago I would has said it was... ...nonsence, but now.. Take this. I think we should keep in touch, Mr. Vogt. You want to know something Mr. Kaun. What would happen if we didn't time travel to the past? I mean... who's going to make us do it? What would happen if you don't do it? I don't know. But one thing I do know. You're going to travel. You are going to travel. Otherwise, this skeleton wouldn't be here.
