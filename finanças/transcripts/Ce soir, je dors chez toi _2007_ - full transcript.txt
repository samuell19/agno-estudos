Tonight I'll Sleep at Yours This pizza was a great idea. Mushrooms usually give me indigestion, but tonight... Okay, Laetitia, we're already living together: you at my place once or twice a week, me at yours once a month. - More like sharing kennels. - Enough! No more discussions. I want an answer. Are we moving in together or not? Why is he hesitating? He's an idiot! No, ladies and gentlemen: an expert. I've been dumped more than most toxic waste. I know love is like a carpet. It wears out easily. I met Laetitia last year. A confused taxi driver, a wedding, a closed church door... and me with my idiotic questions. Excuse me. Are you with the wedding? No, I'm with the broken car. It's closed. Is that normal? No, it's not normal. We called the cops. The priest freaked out. He had an epiphany. He took the congregation hostage! - Really? - No, try the other side. - Thanks. - No problem. I was thinking. If I arrive really late, it's pretty embarrassing. I don't know. I guess... But if I don't go at all it's embarrassing too. Yeah, maybe. If I don't go, maybe I'm worse off than if I go half-way. There's no predicting. They can take it badly whether I go or not. Just go! I see why you're late. Hello. This is Jacques, my editor. A great guy, refined, sensitive... No rest rooms in there! Can't you go elsewhere? Why? This tree is fine. Introduce me. Jacques Jousseaume, my editor. He's a promising writer. He keeps promising me his second book and I still haven't seen it. That's my father. So long! Wait! Here's my first book. "The Ebony Table". Thanks. - My pleasure. - Bye. I don't even know your name! "Alex". I felt she was leaving me for good, and we'd barely met. I was in love. I haven't introduced myself. I'm Alex Caillard. - Alex Baillard is signing... - No, Caillard! I'm sorry. Alex Caillard is upstairs signing copies of his first book, "The Ebony Table". I live the uneventful life of a famous writer. For a friend in the hospital. Tell her it's from Bernard-Henri Levy, for Suzanne. With the accent on "uneventful". For Suzanne, from Bernard-Henri. Just when I'd stopped thinking about her, she reappeared. I was never such a loser. We've met before. I'll remember your name. No you won't, because I never told you. Laetitia. Laetitia, that's it... The name you never told me! I heard you were signing your book. And you came from the South? I got in at 5 a.m. so I wouldn't miss you. So will you sign one for me? "Laetitia, "When a writer... "meets a woman... "and the woman doesn't... "isn't... hasn't..." "To Laetitia. Fondly, Alex." Here. Tough work. Cool shit! You sold three! Clementine, a friend. We've never done anything together. Laetitia, single. We haven't done anything. Either. You can't tell, but I'm scared. Like when Dad removed the training wheels from my bike. Can I ask you a question? Why does your hero want the table? He made love to a woman on it. Why not look for her? He wants absolute love. How strange, a man who prefers furniture to women. Is it autobiographical? As Flaubert said: "Madame Bovary is me!" So you're the table. I'd like your opinion. This is Mrs. Tanaka. Taste this. She cracks me up. What's that white, mushy stuff? It's dog. But you can't cook dog in France! But it's pit bull. Isn't pit bull allowed? Not at all! Little welcome joke for your friend. - Sorry... - It's nothing. - Excuse me. Want one? - I'm trying to quit. You like the piano? As furniture? I can play you something... What's your repertory? Here, I avoid doing "Bridge on the River Kwai", out of pure diplomacy. But I'm not bad with Bach. Mrs. Tanaka, may I? Free-style, off the cuff. Bach. Playing piano is all about fingering. And supple wrists. - Can I try? - Do you play? I love Bach too. Laetitia is the one. She's not like the others. She understands me, protects me. My ray of light. I love her. I don't want to lose her. The best way of keeping her is "joint singles". Separate houses, and happily ever after... Be strong and determined. I have no choice. Do we move in together or not? Yes. Oh, shit... After a year, it's only normal. Like a real couple. Exactly. Monday, 8 a.m.? Monday, 8 a.m... How about 10? Monday, 8 a.m. How about 10? We're already living together. Do we move in together or not? Sharing a kennel! Move in together or not? Yes! Hi honey! Sleep well? It's already Monday, 8 a.m.? Sure is! Actually it's Monday... What's that voice? Where are my miniatures? - Trash! - What? Grendizer? - Trash! - You lost your values! Alex, darling... Laetitia? It's the beginning of our couple. Change! Revolution! You'll just love your new life! What's that voice? Hey, it's Clem. How about a swim? No, there's no room here. See you in 30 minutes. - It's Jacques. Open up! - Who? I'm fed up! Totally fed up! You won't answer the phone! You won't answer emails or faxes! Should I send a pigeon? - Alex is out. - You put me in deep shit! You got the advance a year ago! You have one month! Alex said not to let strangers in. - Tell Alex I stopped by. - I will. - Sorry I bothered you. - No problem, sir. Why are you panicking? It's normal to live with the person you love. It freaks me out. - Stretch. It'll unknot you. - I'm not knotted. What exactly are you scared of? The daily grind. Come on, that's just a cliché! In 3 years, our bedroom will be North Korea! Sure, after a while love mutates. But there's tenderness, complicity! Fuck complicity! I want fires and explosions. Things can't explode forever. Batteries run out. It's just a metaphor. Stretch. You're knotted up. I'm not knotted! I know knotted, and I'm not! You're pretty tense, though. I'm fed up. I'm going. You're all knotted up, trust me. I saw you swimming. You have a healthy tonus. Me? Manureva... like the song by Alain Chamfort. Alex, like part of the song by Claude François. "Alexandrie, Alexandra"... Come here often? I work here. I give lessons. I'm training for the nationals. Okay. Hi, Manureva. - Am I interrupting? - Yes! Who's he? Alex, are you going to judo tonight or coming straight home? Judo... If not, I can go see a movie. No problem. Whatever you prefer. Thanks. That's Rudy, my ex. A pain. He harasses me. He wanted to live together. The things I invented to get out of it! Like what? - Yes? - It's Alex. Jacques is out. He said no strangers. Open up. You can't turn away a friend! At your place it's all the rage! You opened my eyes! I have to start writing! But to write, I need you to be more present. So all of a sudden I had a great idea: you live with me till I finish. - Me live with you? - Exactly! - For what, a month? - Exactly. - I'll coach you. - Exactly. What's the real reason? Laetitia's ultimatum: she's moving in Monday. Or it's over. I'm not ready. I need to think. So you're using your idiot editor to buy some time. Yes. It won't work. Not on her. I have another idea. Come live with me because you need your best friend's presence. You had a nervous breakdown. - I'm not depressed. - No... So the answer's no. Jacques! Please, Jacques! Come live with me! Okay, whatever you say. I don't finish and you get fired! - You know that's blackmail. - Maybe. You think blackmail can get you in there? A burger place? No, there! The Academie Française, my friend! Okay, if I accept, you finish your book. But I'll be hounding you 24/7! So? Exactly. We have a huge selection of oils. This regulates triglycerides. - Is she here? - Yes. It's good for the heart, and nourishes the body and skin... And a swallow is a bird! - It's hilarious. - I love it. - Simple. - Perfectly dumb. I heard another one. It's about a... How are you? - Your cell phone. - Thanks. Alex, this is Pierre-Yves. Pierre-Yves is our new sales manager. Sales managing sounds fun! I was telling a joke to Laetitia. Yeah, what joke? I'm curious. I like to laugh. What does an armoire have in common with... A swallow? Nothing. One's furniture, the other's a bird. I've always found that a bit stupid. I find it funny. Off-beat, very English. The beat's on. Let's go. Wait a minute! You're a writer? Yeah, yeah, yeah. It must be tough to make a living of it. - So you have a part-time job? - Yes. At the Galeries Lafayette. Bernard-Henri Levy works in lingerie and we eat at the cafeteria with Jean d'Ormesson! Sorry, he just quit smoking. It makes him... - Nervous? - No, an asshole. See you tomorrow. He asked to live with you? Exactly. The depression struck like lightning. - He needed a life raft. - So you're the raft. Laetitia, I had no choice. Why you? Are you his only friend? I am! Jacques and I are close. - We're Yin and Yang. - Ping and Pong. - Frick and... - Yeah, I got it. Given our friendship, how could I... So obviously the problem is me and you. - How so? - Living together. If he's at your place. how can I move in? There's no way you're not coming! Jacques or no Jacques, you move in as planned! Oh yeah? Are you sure? And two of us is better than one for taking care of him. The worst is when he cries for no apparent reason. You should get going. For Jacques' sake. No, it's fine. I'm picking him up in an hour. Can you give me a hand here? Upset about Jacques? Yeah. - Are you obsessing? - Obsessing... How's this? I don't look too naked? Get naked first so I can tell. I should see you less till Jacques leaves. What for? For you to help him. So he'll get better, sooner! You know when you're depressed, you need to be alone. Really? I'll leave him once in a while to go to bed, I mean to sleep, at your place. No, tend to him. Afterwards you'll tend to me. - Jacques, can I ask you something? - Yes. Why did you bring Eugene along? He's a kid. Kids can't stay home alone. That's not what I meant. He's happy to be here. Aren't you, Eugene? Why are we staying in this dump? Because Alex won't live with Laetitia. Move! Here's the couch. It turns into a bed. Hands off, it's fragile! We'll just take the bedroom. I thought that... I have a reputation. You'll be fine there. Wake up and straight to work! Tidy up. It's messy here. Come see the kitchen. Stop! Let's get the grand tour. Eugene! Here's everything like green beans and peas... - Rice, pasta... - Why are you showing us this? So you can feed yourselves. Feed ourselves? Ever seen a kitchen before? Yes. We have one. What do you do in a kitchen? You cook. Dad orders take-out. "Dad orders take-out..." Breakfast stuff. There's the coffee and tea, sugar, honey, cereal... You have breakfast delivered? Fauchon. You know, Eugene isn't picky. Paul Anka, Gold Edition. Thanks. Did you tell Alex? - No, I swear. - Any news of Jacques? I saw him last night, at a party. What energy! So much energy he told Alex he's depressed. Come to think of it, it was negative energy. Don't worry. I knew it. I was just checking. Come on, don't get all worked up. Thanks for the record. Laetitia! Caviar? - For breakfast? - Phosphorus. Good for Eugene. - Expecting anyone? - No! Eugene? No, Dad. I don't have a social life yet. Laetitia! I'll buzz you in. Jacques, it's Laetitia. Don't forget. You are depressed. Depressed! He's not doing well. Hello, Jacques. Hell... o. I know you're going through a tough time. You're scaling a mountain face. Don't forget you have two ice-picks you can rely on. I'm talking about Alex and me. You want to cry. Yes. It's good to cry. Cry! Cry! - Hi, Laetitia. - Hello, Eugene. Hello, sir. Jacques, go take a nap. Ah yes... - Seriously? - Yes, I've thought it over. I can't leave you alone with Jacques. You don't know what it's like living with depression. I can imagine. I love you. We'll share the good and the bad. We said you'd come in a month, once Jacques is gone. I'm sorry. We can't all live at your place. Obviously. You need peace and quiet to write. Lots of peace, lots of quiet! Jacques too, to get better. Lots of peace and quiet! I can take some vacation time. What for? Remember Pierre-Yves, my sales manager? So you have a part-time job? Mr. Shiny Bracelet! He has a house in Normandy, in Ouistreham. He's lending it to us. Isn't that cool of him? Totally cool. Ouistreham? No way! I'm a Parisian. Hate the country, hate the sea. I can do chalets, for the fondues. A month. I'm not asking for the world. A month! It's not prison! A country house in Normandy! One way out: tell her the truth. The truth? If I say I lied, she'll leave me. I'd die, you hear? I'd die! I can't live without her. It seems like you're trying to. You can't! As a friend I'm telling you: you better decide in a month. Live with her, or leave her. - Or else... - Or else? You're a shit. As a friend, thanks. Eugene, would you let down your best friend? Using a kid for this is vile. Come on, Eugene. Good day, sir. I can change publishers! Alex isn't my best friend. I have other friends better than him! I can let him down. I do as I please. Pierre-Yves says the house is gorgeous. It's by the ocean. Lots of peace and quiet. How big is your tank? I have no idea! Pump number 8, pull on the lever! The man in purple. Yes, you. Pull on the lever! How beautiful! A feeling of eternity. Such peace and quiet! As far as quiet goes... It's quiet. Taste. - Isn't it good? - Good. But quiet. Here. Pretty, isn't it? Pretty. But quiet. - What are you doing? - I miss Paris. Not bad... And the sea is driving me crazy. You're good at depression. Sometimes you tend to overdo it. Enough, Alex. I'm getting fed up. You don't have to act for me. So, Jacques... did you read it? What do you think? It's awful. You dislike your characters. It sucks. For once I agree with you. I can't write. Laetitia's too much pressure. It's a problem. She's gorgeous, loving, and that's a problem? You can't understand. Just passing through. Don't mind me! I'm not here! I really don't get you. - Careful, Alex. - Hey, you're not my father. I followed you here, so listen up. She's your big chance. You hesitate as usual: "Do I, don't I?" You're an idiot! Is your book worrying you? In a way. Did you forget anything? What? You're 35 today. 35 years old... How did I manage that? Hope you like it. Not buying anything? - I want Rue de la Paix. - No way! Hands off it! That's for me! Six! Take a card. Go directly to jail. Do not pass go. Do not receive money. You really are down and out... You know what Jacques had the nerve to tell me? I don't like characters, so I make them suffer. He hit the nail on the head. Not at all. I describe the state of the modern couple. It's all real, nothing invented. They start unhappy and stay unhappy! Open your eyes, Laetitia. No couple ever lasts. What am I in your life? You're totally different. I love you. You just can't commit. With me, your friends, work: you can't commit. Listen Laetitia... the SUV, vacations in Disneyland, armies of brats: it's not my thing. Understand: if I live with you, I lose you. What a pathetic sentence! Dumb, like you! It's dumb? You are! You'll see if couples are worth it. - Excuse me. - Stop it! Good evening. Just a question... Are you still in love? None of your business. And if you could keep it down a bit. Ladies and gentlemen, let me check something out. For my girlfriend, who is overly romantic. Keep it up and I'll leave. Just a little poll! Sir, don't make a scene. Not a scene, a poll. Everyone who's still in love, please stand up. Come on, come on... I'm going back to Paris. Tell Jacques to stop the act. I knew all along. I heard you, gulls. That's enough. Surveillance cameras. I must be walking too fast. Help! How did this happen? A can. Of sauerkraut. In the oven. So pretty. Pretty... I want you to know... even up in heaven, Daddy will be protecting you. Okay... I want a picture for my friends. Eugene, go wait in the hallway. Your dad's tired. Where's Laetitia? Back in Paris. He nuked a can of sauerkraut! The door blew up in his face! Hold on. I have to go. Mr. Jousseaume? Here, yes. So, Mr. Jousseaume... How do you feel? Are you in pain? Not really. That's a good sign. On the other hand, my eyes are cold. Not a good sign. We'll keep an eye on him for a week. Because of the sauerkraut? I fear he's sliding into depression. You got it all wrong. He's faking it. I asked him to. Who am I, Dr. Doolittle? I'm sick of Normandy. I want to go back to France! Jacques, it's for a week! A week. Will you look after Eugene? Why Eugene? Thanks, you're like a brother. Eugene! What the hell? Stop messing with my computer! I'm correcting your spelling. Really? Many mistakes? No, it's mostly syntax. Should I stop? No, go on. Keep up the good work! Hello, Alex. Here's your mail. And here's a note from your girlfriend. How was Normandy? - Change the subject. - Okay. I'm so happy to meet your parents. It's mostly a chance to see the farm. Did you have other plans? Nothing beats being with you! Do you like orangeade? She say anything? No, I just saw her get in a car. - With a gentleman. - Describe him. Young, well-dressed... Part-time job? Shiny bracelet? That's right. How are you, Mom? This is Pierre-Yves de Tailly. Our new sales manager. Good to meet you. Orangeade? - I'd love one. - Strawberry or mint? - Strawberry. - I'll be right back. I'll come help. I'll leave you to talk. What beautiful countryside! It's far, but so pretty. Far from what? Far from... nothing. I like the new one. - He's not a new one. - Really? You're still with... what's his name? Alex. His name is Alex. I'm sorry I can't remember but he's never come to see us. He never invited us anywhere. He's always maintained a distance. Yeah well, distance is his middle name. We know nothing about him. He never introduced us to his parents. That's normal. They're dead. He could have taken us to the cemetery. Between an armoire and a swallow... The armoire's furniture. A swallow's a bird. Exactly. I think your Alex is a bit like your father. Really? How so? Men need an electroshock to understand. If I hadn't slept with Louis... Louis Franval. You slept with Louis Franval? The veterinarian? You never told me! I forgot to tell my daughter? How silly of me! Don't worry, it went well. I needed to make your father understand that if he didn't live with me, he'd lose me. Have you considered changing names? "Sun Pearls". Nice and catchy for foreign sales. Nice and phony for local sales. "Cosso Oil" has always been the name and will continue to be, even if we're far away. Everything okay? Why is that yogurt on your telephone? It's to filter calls and so that... It's very complicated, Eugene. Something adults do. I'm unhappy, Eugene. I love Laetitia. I want to know if her new guy has a bracelet. Hence the yogurt container on the phone. That's dumb. I'd like to speak with Pierre-Yves, please. Hold on, I'll get him. That bitch! It's breathtaking. The land, these olive trees... Their roots have somehow taken hold in me. It's normal. My whole family was buried here. Each tree is someone in the family. Here's Uncle René. Over there, way in back, is Granny Jacqueline. Also known as "Granny Jelly". - How sweet. - But a total lie. Don't do that. I believe everything. I'm gullible. I like it. When everyone's asleep later, come to my room. This time I know you're lying. No, I mean it. - Hello, ma'am. - Call me Odile, if you like. Okay, ma'am. Will you be long? About an hour. I'm going swimming. You're athletic. That's good. He's going there to relax, not to work out. Laetitia left for the weekend with a bracelet. I really need a swim. Alex. We met the other day... Your ex was here. You're not swimming? Yes, yes... maybe... no. Part of me says yes, and part says no. How about helping me out? Sure thing! That's not funny. It's cold. Manureva... This isn't funny. What are you doing, Pierre-Yves? I don't know. I think your hand is on my breast. I don't know. Sorry, I don't know what got into me. I wanted to check if I loved Alex. And? I do. But it was good. - Was it? - Yes, really good. - You liked it a lot? - Loved it! Especially the beginning, when you... It was great. - Really? - Yes. And the solo in the middle? The solo? A little too "solo". Yeah. I felt the same way. But the encore... The encore! It was so nice. - Oh yeah? - Yeah, there was a... - Really? - Yeah. I'm glad to hear that because the encore's my favorite part. Oh yeah? That makes two of us. Cool. You're not upset with me? - That's good. - No problem! It's not an issue. What do we do now? No idea. A painter, Guernica. It doesn't ring a bell? No, no idea. It's a car too. The Picasso. Picasso. There's no "the". He was a man. How do you feel? Okay. Is the Eiffel Tower still here? They haven't removed anything except the Champs Elysées. Just kidding. - Eugene? - Fine. With the concierge. I'm freeing myself, reassembling myself, finding myself. How's Laetitia? The taxis are to the left. I'd prefer to walk a little. Paris! Paris! Smell that? Smell that stench? That's Paris! Taste this. It's a new recipe. It's a salmon maki... with something, I don't know what. I don't know either. It could be toxic, Mrs. Tanaka. Not toxic. I use it in my shower. Are you alone tonight? I may be alone a lot starting tonight. Hello, this is Laetitia. Leave a message. It's me. I think we should talk. How about tonight at 8:30 at Tanaka? Got your message. You wanted to see me. What's up? How are your parents? Yeah, they're fine. It's nice to visit your parents... alone. It was you with the yogurt container? Yes, maybe... What's the difference? You brought him home pretty fast. I see your mom with olive diaper fantasies. - We were working. - Working on what? "Bracelets, From Pre-History to Now!" - You want the truth? - I do. This weekend at their house I realized... I wanted a restaurant with an accordionist. All closed. Eugene's alone at my place? Not alone. I put some music on for him. He never saw 33 rpms. Are you kidding? My vinyls? How are you? My birthday is tomorrow. Don't forget. You deserve an Oscar. For your role in "The Normandy Depression". Bravo! Hands off Manureva What the hell? Who did this? Eugene. It could be him. It's what I deduced, objectively, without wanting to accuse. Maybe he's borderline depressed. He writes well for an 8 year-old. I think you owe us an explanation. Me? Yes, Jacques. You deserve an Oscar. Now I remember... I'm so sorry... I had a feeling... that Manureva... her husband... he was mean... The bottom line? My stuff gets trashed. I'm going. You clean up. I'm beat. You're picking us up anyway... Do I have a choice? Didn't you find her quiet in the car? I can't judge. I was in the back seat. Even from behind she didn't speak. Yes, her back was quiet. But maybe her face was silently speaking. You're a pain in the ass! I have to talk to her. It's a time bomb. She's testing me. She knows everything! Any champagne left? That table drank all theirs. They're pigs! - Did you see Laetitia? - No. She's here? Would I ask if she's here if she weren't? I don't know where, but she's here, so I asked. There we go. He's knotted up. Pain in the ass! He wants Laetitia's back to speak to him. You're drunk as a skunk. And then some! I'll give you a call. I was looking for you. - You okay? - Yeah, fine. Nice party, huh? Fancy. Okay. Laetitia, I don't know what got into me. Me neither. I have to say something I've never said before. Every day I think of you. That's not... I agree. Even when I dream, I dream of you. I even dream I'm dreaming about you. And in the dreams where I dream of you, I dream of you. That's nice. You should write that. What do you want me to do? How about "Antonia" for a girl? Perfect! And for a boy: "Lino". Lino? Like an abbreviation for linoleum? No... Like Lino Ventura. Either Lino Ventura or floor covering is fine. Wait, I have an idea. Come on! It's cold! Look! Wanna taste? We're not allowed! Sure we can, just a smidgeon. Stop it, you can tell! - Wait a sec. - Stop it! - Stop it. Don't touch! - The kiwi! - Really? - Yeah. - I should have seen it coming. - Yep. I'm seeking political asylum in our apartment. You taste good. Yummy! Coffee? What is it? A present. For the two of us. Open it. It's... Antonia... or Lino. Of course. Funny how a tiny thing like this can change your life. The little cross means it's positive. Positive? When is it for? In eight months. Not longer? I drew the cross with a pen. Okay... It's over, Alex. Taste this. No thanks, not tonight. Did she leave? Yes. You know, I read your "Ebony Table". Oh yeah? I didn't know. What did you think of my book? - Your book... - Hold on. I'm going through a rough patch, so easy on the criticism. It's a piece of shit. Your novel is hollow and empty. Your vision of love is all wrong, Alex. Talk to me as if I were her. Don't take it personally, but that would be hard. Close your eyes. Go on... Whatever floats your boat. Talk to her. Go tell her, Alex. On the double. I was nearby. I figured I'd come say hello. You came to see Laetitia. - No... - She's in New York. Is she? She moved there. America... She mentioned it often. And did she say anything about me? That you'd stop by one day pretending you were nearby. In fact you'd be dying to see her. She really got me wrong. Ladies and gentlemen, we'll soon be landing in New York. Raise your trays, fasten your seat belts and Alex: for Laetitia, you're history! I'm French. Me too. What room is Ms. Cosso in? Ms. Cosso, of course. Room 1500. I have to call her first. Your name? It's Alex. Ms. Cosso? Yes, hello. Gabriel at the front desk. Alex is here. He'd like to see you. I'll take care of it. Good evening. Sorry, she doesn't want to see you. What do you mean? You said it wrong. - Put her on! - I'm sorry, sir. You're sorry? I'm sorry! I want to talk to her! Do I have to call security? Okay, it's me. - I got carried away. - No problem. I have to talk to you. Open up, please. I need five minutes of your time. Do me this one favor. Give me one good reason to open up. One. It's Christmas Eve. Five minutes, that's all. If it's just to say you're sorry, don't bother. I didn't come here for remorse or regrets. I came to give you this. What is it? Everything I was too stupid to say. No, no! I was stupid! I'm not protesting. - Who's he? - Alex, this is Mike. - Mike who? - Mike Forester. Forester who? What did you expect, Alex? Me among the Mormons, praying for your return? Call me stupid... but yes. Well, no! Make her happy, Mike. She deserves it. Thanks for the Invasion. Fucking American! Stop it, Alex! Would I steal your girl? I'll bust your face! Wait! You don't know her! I love her! Where are you? - Somewhere in New York. - New York is big! Yeah, I know. Let me guess. You own a poster of the Brooklyn Bridge. You have pictures of the bridge everywhere. - And 3 Brooklyn Bridge mugs. - 2. I broke one. So you're on the Brooklyn Bridge. Maybe. Okay, take care. So long. If you'd waited a second, you'd still have a cell phone. I read it. So? Were there any syntactical problems? I'm ready, Laetitia. Where do we sleep tonight? Tonight we sleep at our place. What about a big, sunny apartment with a big, black dog in the hallway. Okay, but we'll call him Bracelet. Bracelet! Bracelet, sit! Stay! Mrs. Tanaka is in the kitchen! For our house-warming party, she'll serve pit-bull sushi and do her schtick. There's Eugene! I forgot to tell you. Eugene is writing my next book. Jacques is here too but he won't stay long. Have we forgotten anything? No... we haven't forgotten a thing.
