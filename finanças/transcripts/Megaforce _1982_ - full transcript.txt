[Narrator]: Despite official denials by leaders of the free world... ...sources now confirm the existence of MegaForce... ...a phantom army of super elite fighting men... ...whose weapons are the most powerful science can devise. Their mission, to preserve freedom and justice... ...battling the forces of tyranny and evil in every corner of the globe. [Aide]: We have removed you from the facility... ...where your labors, they're being exploited... ...to help you... ...in your valiant never-ending struggle... ...against the villains of tyranny, period. The Bourgeois Counterrevolutionary Committee... ...of that fraternal Camibian People's Reactionary Party pledges... [Duke Guerera]: - Oh, God... [Aide]: - ...its total support... ...to your glorious struggle, semicolon. Furthermore, comma... ...we wish to assure you that our presence... ...in your beautiful and beloved country... ...is not meant as an act of aggression... ...against the people, comma... ...but rather is in a valid gesture to the global powers... ...who try to grab the land and the wealth... ...from the innocent working masses, period. [music in] Fire. [continuous explosions] [sound of tanks driving] Wait for me, I'll try to finish my speech... ...because if I don't talk, nobody understands. I gotta talk! [Guerera over the link]: I am attacking the nearest forces. Sector 4. [Guerera over the link]: Fire! [continuous explosions] I understand. Move right ahead. [explosion] Have hostile armor... [Guerera over the link]: ...border in retreat. Can intercept and destroy. Request permission to interdict. Permission granted. It's the 4th time Guerera and his bandits have crossed the border this month! They've destroyed everything in sight. Even the President himself wouldn't... - ...pass up this opportunity. - General, you cannot cross the border. Sorry, chaps, maybe next time, return to base. [jetliner engines] [music in] [touchdown] [music stops] Where the hell is this? [thud] No welcoming committee? Now, careful with that. Would you mind telling me where we are? - Where are we? - Where they told me to bring you. Ask a silly question you get a silly answer, don't you? This is absolutely preposterous! [car leaving] What about that bone-shaking three-hour ride... ...across those impossible roads? And that chauffeur. Yes. What about him? I wonder what side he's on. Oh... Oh, my God, it's hot. [ominous music] Did you notice that in the last 2 and a half hours of that interminable journey... ...we didn't pass a petrol pump? Slipshod, that's what it is. Cremation was certainly not in my agenda for today. They didn't even have the decency to send a helicopter. Or a cool vodka and tonic. General, isn't it too hot to work yourself up? You know, even in the worst days of the Yemen desert campaign... ...we received more civilized treatment and we were prisoners at that time. General, please sit down. Yes, you're probably right. Yes, I've said enough. [musical stress] [gunshots] [snake hissing] [Dallas]: Howdy, folks. I think I need that vodka and tonic. Howdy. Sneaky little devils, ain't they? They don't always play by the rules. They're supposed to rattle. How was y'alls trip? Would you kindly explain the meaning of all this? Why, sure. I'm from MegaForce. My name's Dallas. Dallas? What's your rank? Rank? Why ain't nobody got a rank in MegaForce... ...except the Commander, but we all call him Hunter. Hunter? Well, Mr. Dallas, I'm a General and protocol demands... ...that I be greeted by my opposite number in rank and authority. Oh, shoot, General. Now you know there's a big difference between rank and authority. And you are Major Zara Bindu, only daughter to the President. And the kind of officer that makes bivouacking in the woods seem... ...downright desirable. This way, Ma'am. I'll get your things. Just follow me. Bloody barbarian. Couldn't you possibly have arranged to have us met in more... - ...comfortable circumstances? - Why, sure. - [car door slamming] - Hey, Zac? Give me a 4 x 7 in place of that rock. [slow Hawaiian music] Oh, Kari, darlin'. You're looking prettier everyday. I just love these holograms. They're the cat's meow. Bee-dee-bee-dee-bee-dee! That's all folks. Right this way, Major Ma'am. We can make anything we want with these holograms... ...from a boulder to a beach. Get right on in there. Make yourself at home. General, after you, sir. All right, Beethoven. Introduce yourself. Welcome, General, Major. I'm Zachary Taylor. Very pleased to meet you. - Gladys Knight and the Pips? - Vivaldi. - Winter? - Spring. All right, Einstein. Fire this thing up. See if you can find the base. Hunter, Dallas... ...Zachary Taylor. Wasn't he one of their president's? - Hm? - Never mind. [car engine starts, main music theme in] [continuous steady beeps] Sparrow 1's inbound traversing sector Zulu... ...to Romeo post coordinates in Vector 6. Egg, we're showing a hostile track in Sector Charlie 11. Condition, red. If you're stopping to thrill us with another of your holographic displays... ...it's quite unnecessary. Kindly go on. Oh no, General. When you hear that you'd better stop. Means big brother's watching. That's hostile all right. But only to another armadillo. Judging by his speed, I'd say... ...he's had a pretty hard night. I envy him. [Taylor sighs] Should I wade no more, Returning where as tedious as go o'er. - Shakespeare. - Macbeth, Act 3 Scene 4. - Yes, of course. - Oh, Lord. [disco music in] [music stops] Is there something else out there I'm supposed to see? No, here, General. Just listen. [music starts again accompanied by electronic motor-bike revving] [music with stylized explosions and shots] Eagle base, this is Red 3 now commencing rock target range. - Roger, Red 3. - [continuous firing and explosions] That's the boss. - Y'all wanna meet that man? - Love to. [jet turbine slowly stops] Commander Hunter, I presume. Oh, call me Hunter. I'm General Byrne-White Republic of Sandoon. It's a pleasure sir. Target sighted and closing. - Major Vanvuda, I presume. - Call me Zara. Commander, we have travelled half way around the world... ...to learn how our forces will interface with yours... ...to help destroy Guerera. I hope your plan reflects greater precision than we have seen so far. Well, there are reasons for everything that we do, Major. Zara, right? And do they include leaving your guests to bake in the middle of the desert... ...greeted by a cowboy, and be attacked by wild creatures? If it's a comfortable tour you're looking for, I have connections at Disneyland. Target destroyed. My, my, my. You do have quite a way with words. Is that the general consensus? Battles are won or lost on quick decisions... Major. Right this way, folks, if you would. And that's the way it is. Major... Dallas? What you need? - What wild creatures? - Oh, just old no shoulder. No sho-- Oh, snake. - Hologram? - No, real. That long. - That big around? - Dang near. That's a big one. [music starts] [Dallas]: Now, General, I don't want you to think... ...we set this whole thing up just to show off with y'all. Everyone of us gets to go through the same target practice... ...at least once a month. [laughs] Oh, man. It'll blow your socks off! I just love it. What did you think about it? You know, it was an absolutely dazzling performance... ...on the part of Commander Hunter. And those motorcycles. Unique, I must say. Delta Mark Four. Egg's pride and joy. He's been clucking over those things like a mother hen... ...ever since he hatched them on his slide rule. - Egg? - The Egg. He's in charge of research and development. The man's got more degrees than a red-hot thermometer. Weird, but damn is he smart. [Male voice]: Call research and development immediately. Unit 6 call your weigh station. General. Maybe the journey was worthwhile after all. My God. It's fantastic. Well, here comes the Egg and that's no yolk. [laughs] Dallas, when a person doesn't have less on, they have-- - More on? - Exactly. Major Vanvuda, General Byrne-White, Professor Eggs. - How do you do? - We have heard a lot about you. You're the gentlemen with more degrees than a thermometer. We're most impressed by your Delta Mark 4 motorbike. Thank you. Anytime you wanna browse around just come on down. I'm on level 4. Wait a minute. This is level 4. I just come down here. Well, how is it coming along? - It? - It. Oh, it. Oh, it's finished. And I think it's gonna work. Just remember it's the red buttons. One and then two. Oh, you're a genius. When can I try it? Well, I'm testing it right now in the wind tunnel. But at best, you know, it's only good for an emergency. Okay, it's wonderful to meet everybody. One, two, huh? Major, General, it's been a pleasure. I'll see you later. May I show you around? - It puts the pyramids to shame. - It had better. It cost a whole lot more. It's a totally self contained facility mounted on gyro-leveling stabilizers... ...that will enable it to withstand a 25 megaton direct hit. There are seven levels encompassing 10 million square feet. Right this way, gentlemen. Shoot. We used 40 thousand dollars worth of brooms and mops last year... ...just trying to keep this place clean. - Y'all set? - Yup. Now each of the levels serves a very specific purpose. They range from living quarters to satellite communications... ...photo imagery and a full array of training simulators... ...a laser lab, dynamic and static ballistic test beds. The ground level is our weapons ready area. Oh, this is just one base. You ought to see where we keep our boats and all them other gizmos. It's an awesome set of toys. That's Russian. It's they're very latest top secret. It was. Good Lord, man, I thought that was still on the drawing board. - Or at least still in the testing stages. - It is. Forgive me if I appear to be a little confused. How did you come by all this? Well, all we know is every so often they just back up a truck... ...and unload a whole mess of stuff in all sizes and colors. - They? - SCUFF. Supreme Command United Free Forces. The leaders of every free nation in the world... ...secretly contribute their best men and their most advanced equipment. And they determine where and when we strike. A phantom army. Well, nobody here expects a ticker-tape parade. No, no. Every man knows that he's been written off already... ...and that his files have been altered to show them either as deserters... - ...or better yet dead, right? - Yeah. And the funny thing is you gotta volunteer just to get in. May I show you to your quarters? [door buzzer] Just a moment. [door buzzer] - Hi. - Commander. Well... you look great. Is everything all right? The accommodations are quite beautiful considering I spend... ...most of the time in the field sleeping along side my troops. Oh yes, combat al fresco. In my country there's nothing unusual about that. Women fight side by side with men. I'm sure I've seen at least as much action as you have. Well, I don't know? Oh, I see. Quite a gear, yes, the Legion of Merit. Seems to be one missing. Which one? The Good Conduct Medal. I wouldn't think that was high on your list. Tells you a lot about a soldier, soldier. You have me at a slight disadvantage without your ribbons. Oh, no, I didn't say that you can tell everything about a soldier by looking... ...at his chest. Or hers? Right. Shall we go to dinner? [thumps] How about that? How about what? It's a stealth nose. It's a stealth nose. They don't even know you're coming. General, you wanna see something... ...that'll give you a high speed mach blow out? Just watch this. Oh, Egg, I love this one. This is my favorite. It's nothing. Just an inverse photosensitive skin. We use on everything, weapons, uniforms, vehicles. - It's nothing. - It's nothing, huh? [laughs] Military installations with three... ...armored brigades and one infantry division. There on maneuvers in the vicinity of the city named Tierra del-- Zara, you won't believe this. They monitor every conversation in every military installation in the world. - Hostile and friendly. - It's nothing. It's just an automatic monitoring system. Nothing. What's this? May I? [Chinese language over speaker] Now that's the Third People's Republic Airborne Infantry HQed 40 miles north... ...on the Yaloo River. Interpret. I'm calling your mother tomorrow and see if she could watch the kids. Don't cook tonight. After work, I'll go by Chang-Wa Street... ...and pick up some birds. Same problems, different language. Everything they say is broken down and stored... ...in the computer memory banks. SCUFF has a profile on everybody in the world that they deemed important... ...and it is complete. Now. What else is up there apart from my name and birth date? Well, you were born in Essex, your Daddy's rich... ...and your Mamma's good looking. Now it says here that you got a helicopter that's red and white... ...and that you like it so much you put in shag rugs and air conditioning. An absolute necessity. I spend considerable time on that aircraft. Let's get on to someone more important. - Guerera. - Coming up. He was born in Costa Brava, August 14th, 1945. He's father was Agustos Guerera, a plantation owner, 300,000 hectares. Mother's name was Maria Alvarez Sanchez... ...she was a daughter of a wealthy mining family. I see you've memorized everything about him. No, I didn't have to do that. I know him. Guerera and his bunch of fanatics have been roaming up and down... ...the continent, toppling one country after another. Just for the record, General, there's one thing that Guerera is not, a fanatic. Everything that he does he does for money. Is that a personal insight? Guerera and I go back quite in a long ways. Jump school, counterinsurgency, staff command college. We served together for 18 months. Really? He was decorated twice for Valor Under Fire. And when things got a little shaky in Costa Brava, he was called home. To command a crack armored regiment assigned to protect the capital. But he was never allowed to fire a shot. The politicians, to save themselves, ordered him to surrender. And he had to watch his country die. Political expediencies. But I saw him again about three years later in Nice. I call him mercenaries in Rhodesia. He was taking his R and R on the Cote d'Azur. He had quite a bank roll and he was buying... ...anything that he can get his hands on. I spent a few drunken days with him. I came... ...that close to getting him back on our side. What happened? He stole my lighter. That's the way it is. General. Major. Operation Hook, Line and Sinker. Primary objective is to trick Guerera to cross the border... ...bringing him in your territory at a predetermined time and place. Phase One, the Hook. Our three air craft will cross Camibian airspace at 0328... ...flying terrain avoidance radar at no more than 900 feet. At 0330 our re-supply plane will take a new heading south-southwest... ...to its drop zone at 0400... ...allowing the remaining aircraft to continue on to the primary objective. [electronic beep] Now Guerera's forces are in two main units. Heavy amour here by the border, and here... ...headquarters, fuel and ammunition dumps. Our remaining planes are over the DZ... ...with first vehicle out of the door at 0421... ...last at 0423, on the ground combat-ready at 0426. It's 5 kilometers to the dumps. We will strike at 0430, destroy fuel and ammo dumps... ...and as much equipment as we can withdraw and regroup by 0434. Four minutes? Isn't that a bit ambitious? The faster to go cut straight through the base, split our forces in two... ...divert the amour from the dumps, blow it and be out before... ...he knows what hit him. By 0435... ...Guerera's second armored unit has been alerted... ...and will definitely be on the move. Phase Two, the Line. It is 82 kilometers to our re-supply area. First light is 0507, sunrise at 0535. We arrive at 0538... ...are refueled, reloaded and moving by 0558. Eagle Base will start live time monitoring of Guerera... ...and relay his speed and course to TACCOM... ...will triangulate us towards an intercept point 5 kilometers from the border. Adjusting our speed to arrive there 5 minutes before Guerera. Phase Three, the Sinker. We move in our final leg allowing Guerera to maintain visual contact... ...and close in on us until we cross the border there at approximately 0717. And he is all yours. I can't wait. Now, the team's all packed and ready to go. We'll leave sometime within the next 48 to 72 hours... ...depending upon Guerera's movements and the weather conditions. Any questions? If you succeed, I shall not only be waiting with my armor for Guerera... ...but for you with chilled champagne. - Dom Perignon - For 60. Dallas, that was the best hologram we've seen yet. Sir? [music jingle] [laughs] Bee-dee. That's all, folks! [music stops] [clears his throat] The Dom Perignon make it for 61. I'm going with them on this mission. I beg your pardon? Commander, I'm a soldier, not a politician. Major, my men are the finest soldiers that the free world can provide. Excuse my presumption... ...but I find it difficult to believe that you possess the same expertise. Try me. [plane engine] Now, remember, you keep your arms and your legs out like this... ...so you don't go into a spin. And you're gonna use your hands and your feet as airfoils, right? Now, to gain vertical air speed... ...just drop your head down and just fold your... ...arms at your side like wings. Got it? Now, when this light goes out, hit it. Now, there's nothing to be afraid of. If you want me to... ...I can take you out by the hand... ...and if you freeze up, I can pull the rip cord for you. - Is that all? - U-huh. [music starts] [music stops] You know, my dear, at the rate you're going... ...you may well end up commanding MegaForce. [helicopter engine starts] Everybody buckled up? May I? Be my guest. [Zara]: Activate the field of transponder and give me... ...the heading and IFR frequency, please. Yes, ma'am. [motor-bike jet engine and multiple explosions] [Speaker]: Laser just been off limits until 0300 hours. Well, Commander, a perfect score. What else would you like to see me do to prove... ...I'm capable of going on this mission? No. No, you have more than proved yourself. - I have an apology to make. - An apology? Yeah. For allowing this to go on as long as I did. It was unfair of me. But I have to congratulate you. I didn't think that you-- I'm so sorry. I just can't take you with us. Is it because I'm a woman? No. Then why? You have got to understand. Those 60 guys... ...they have trained, they have fought and lived as one man. They think alike to the point that they each know... ...what the other man would do under any circumstance. And an outsider like-- Any outsider... ...would create enough uncertainty to jeopardize the entire mission. And more importantly, their lives. And I just can't allow that to happen. No, Commander. It's not that you can't. It's that you won't. Like it? No. Understand? Yes. But that's what makes you what you are. A great leader. [sound alert] You best be packing your bags, they just confirmed your reservation. Okay Cap, hold down the fort. All MegaForce personnel, Operation Hook, Line and Sinker is a go. - Hunter? - Yeah. Oh, Hunter, wait. Wait. Now, I did tell you about the one-two. No, one... two. [pats him] Oh, right. But I did tell you! Did tell you. [music starts] I'll jet back by Concorde and meet you at the border with my division. I don't expect you'll have too many problems. Good luck, also. Thanks. Even though I'm not going, I'm happy I came this far. So am I. Hey, listen, I know this great little hotel in London. It's called the Lion's Head. Why don't we have our drink there when this is over, okay? Hang on back there, girls. [plane engines building up] Good hunting, fellows. [music stops] Let me go over this one more time so I got it right. Now we move in as a unit spearheading up to this point... ...then Anton and Suki make a flanking movement around here... ...as we continue-- You might as well have brought her along. - We'd have got some work done then. - What? Oh, you know I couldn't do that. Couldn't or wouldn't? Didn't. Well, I know how you're feeling, I've been there myself. Let me see. One time before I made jump into Da Nang, an old buddy of mine... ...told me something that made me feel a whole lot better. What? What, what, what? What did he tell you? Well, he said... ...you love them in blue and you love them in red. But most of all, you love them in both. It's totally inapplicable to anything that's going on here and it's dumb. - Who told you that? - You did. But it's very wise, very wise. I thought you say something like that, now won't you help me out? [plane engines] [whistles] Is he kidding? I've been working on that thing for a month... ..and haven't gotten two sides that match. It is not just him. All Americans are strange. Sixkiller, what movie star played a famous Indian chief with nine letters? Brando. [plane engines] [someone whistles] Wiseacre. [foreign language] When I find this silly cube, as interesting as what is really important. Girls. I will get this done in a second. Eagle 3, departing formation for resupply drop. Since you're gonna be home early call my girl, will you? - Tell her I'm gonna be a day late. - I was gonna call her anyway. Very funny. [turbulence] For this unexpected turbulence, the pilot sends his apology. And your usual. [sighs] [plane engines] Stand by, you guys. We're approaching the drop zone. [foreign language] Hey, Lopez. I got it. What? Lancaster. Yeah! - Now you tell me! - Yeah! Here we go. - Who was that Indian Chief he played? - Geronimooooo! [vehicle engine] Check. [laughs, claps his hands] Having fun? Yes! No... I don't know what you mean. I mean, do you like being out here in this garden spot of the world? - It is necessary. - For what? For the revolution. Give me another bottle. All right. [chuckles] Checkmate. [laughs] Colonel, what do you-- You won. [laughs] One minute. This is your friend, TACCOM, begin systems check now. Gentlemen, start your engines. [music in, clicking of the switches] [engines fire up] All systems go. Follow me, good buddy, and you won't get lost. [rumble of engines] [main music theme in] Pull the line here, George. Systems are stabilized. TACCOM in final position. Start your four-minute countdown. [continuous explosions] Additional contact. Proceeding down main corridor. Split up, guys. [machine guns firing] Continue down the corridor. We're under attack! This is a full scale invasion. I want the armor out. Doesn't anybody here speak English?! I said I want the armor out! Now! [multiple explosions] Hey, George. Watch your sensor replay. The only thing hurt was his pride. I think I'll make him a tape so he can show it to his friends. TACCOM, I have some malfunctions. My dashboard looks like the red light district. Hey, I hope you're gonna be able to unload that vehicle. Why don't you just put it on remote, step out... ...and I'll just drive it down and use it for a detonator. Bon voyage! [throws a kiss] [continuous explosions] Disengage. George. You still up there? Where else would I be? You expecting any company, George? No, no, no company. Then we've got some uninvited guests. [electronic pulses] Well, you talk about high tech? Oooh! The Egg must have worked overtime on that thing. With all his technology, we're liable to get automated right out of a job. [burning sounds] [shouting in Spanish] I don't care if you don't speak Spanish. - They're blowing the whole thing. - What are you doing here? - They want a report. - Don't wanna hear about it. Take this. Get in that. - And follow them. - But Colonel, I-- Move! Idiot, move! Don't wanna hear it! [music in] Eagle Base, I'm transmitting visual of 60 happy guys minus three vehicles. We've been waiting for sunrise so you could see our true colors. [cheers] It's right on schedule guys! [glasses shatter to pieces] We have reached the enclave. Are you safe Colonel? Yes. Yes. No. No. Yes. Fine. I'm not talking. [music stops] [loud thud] I don't believe it. I get all dressed up to go to battle and what happens? We end up spending two hours stacking rockets. Now you tell me how I'm gonna talk to my people when I get back home. It's gonna be downright embarrassing. Tell them anything you want. Who'll know the difference? - Hey, I'm gonna know the difference. - Sixkiller... [in Spanish, then]: Stop complaining. We were the heroes in the last three missions. What more do you want? How much further, Daddy? Just over the ridge. SixKiller. Open. - Got your ears on? - We hear you. ETA in five minutes. Don't answer when I talk. Just listen... ...and do what I tell you. Don't talk. Period. Sir. - You are quite sure there's no mistake? - No, Sir. It came straight from Denver. Damn it. [helicopter engine speeds up] - You take American Express? - Gas only. Fill me. Come on, Dallas. Did you bring back any scalps? No, we take no scalps, Crazy Horse. But I tell you, son. We did raise some kind of hell. [cheers] [painful yells] Colonel, I'm happy to report. I find their secret base. You idiot, that's no secret. Is that all you're gonna tell me? Well, Colonel, something else. The cars, the motorcycles, the uniforms. - They painted them! - Painted them? Estupido! [shouting in Spanish] Oh, Kari. Show that man your magic. [Hawaiian music] Are you there? Are you there? Of all the idiots I have around, you're the worst. Siberia's too good for you. I'm gonna send you to East Germany unless you tell me what's going on! Nothing. Nothing else, Comrade. [in Spanish] That armored column is 40 miles north. About an hour away. Oh, and the inbound chopper we've been checking? It has no armament on board. Let's hope not. Why would Byrne-White send us a Medivac? - We didn't order one, did we? - No. Shoot, man, it just might be your very own Florence Nightingale. [laughs] - Ace! - Duke! Is he putting us on? Compadre, it's been too long. You don't have to fly out here just to say hello. My feelings were hurt. You skipped town. You didn't call me. I left you a message. Funny. Ace, you were always the card. Duke, you was always a prince. Very nice. One piece, zipper. That's chic. Not a bad layout. You been here long? What's going on... Ace? Film at 11. Mano, you stole my lighter. You were so drunk. You forgot. You gave it to me. I loaned it to you. Ace. You forgot to give it back. Here, it's yours... Compadre. - You got another friend? - General Edward Byrne-White. Oh, heard a lot about him. Always wanted to meet him. - Got a minute? - Yeah. - Come on. - Okay. [helicopter engine] Nothing's changed, Ace. You're here 25 minutes and you're flying them in. That's the daughter of the President of Sardoon. That's better, it's like thoroughbred. You can't beat those bloodlines. Guerera. I'll deal with this. The very model of a modern Major General. I don't believe it. At last we got him. - You've captured him, good show. - No. He just flew in for a light. General, it seems we're here for the same purpose... ...to give him some terrific bad news. - May we have a word in private? - General... Don't waste our time. You know, I know, she knows. Now, he's the only who doesn't. Either you tell him now or I will. [Guerera laughs] Ace... this is gonna kill you! Dallas? Keep them working. Commander, you and your men have done a splendid job. You've achieved the impossible. But one of those exigencies mentioned earlier seems to have arisen. Which one? You chaps seem to have done rather too good a job. The other fellows have advised us that this operation may be regarded... ...as a blatant act of war instigated by our side. - Now, in point of fact-- - In point of fact. If you allow us to cross your border, you'll probably be at war within 24 hours. - How did I do? - I'm glad you understand. This rotten business we're in. Fortunes of war and all that. As SCUFF says, that's the way it is. You know, General, in all my years of soldiering, I've learned one thing. - It's all on the wheel. - The wheel? It all comes around. Interesting. Well, if you'll excuse me, I have a press conference in a couple of hours. I really should be off. So let's wrap this up, shall we? Good luck. [slow music in] Are you okay? No. I tried. I'm sorry. - I know. - I wanted it to be different. - I know that too. - Geopolitics, political expediencies... ...it never changes. [helicopter engine starts] Hey! I'll see you. Remember where? Lion's Head Hotel, London. Tomorrow. [music builds up] Come on, Compadre, walk me to my chopper. You know, whenever you call me Compadre, it always cost me something. Let's get serious, what the hell do you want? My friend, you're in bad trouble. You have violated the integrity of a sovereign nation. And to tell you the truth, it makes them very angry. Now, on my flight here I flew all over entire Gambian army. And they should be here in about an hour. Which means you better start moving out of here pronto. But where can you go? Our modern Major General isn't letting you cross the border. And where can your planes come in? At the Capital? There is only one place, the Dry Lake. We both know that. And my tanks are there right now. Ah... Ace, it's all over. Really? For old time's sake, I'm gonna make you an offer. You give me your word that your men will lay their weapons down... ...and I will guarantee your safe passage out of here. Not enough seats. Ace, you are the best commander that ever lived. Maybe you're even better than me. But you have one fatal flaw. You've never understood that they are-- they are just numbers! Numbers! You're an idealist. In the '70s we could be idealists. But today, it's too expensive. You know, there's one thing you never understood... ...that there are some things that you can't put a price on. If you were to say anything else, I would have been disappointed. I love you, but you're hopeless. See you, Ace. [helicopter engine starts] You idiot, come here! We've got to get going! [engine starts] Yes, Colonel. All right. I see them, I see them. [yells] [paper tears off] Bring them in. Now, that is something. Gentlemen, we have a little problem here. As I see it we've got two choices. One, is we split up... ...and everybody heads for the border on his own. Oh, now, Ace. You know that ain't gonna work. If I don't have somebody to follow, I'm gonna get lost. [all laugh] Okay. All right, choice two... The Dry Lake bed is surrounded by mountains on three sides. Now, Guerera has moved his army so the mountains are at his back. He knows that the only way in is straight down his nose. As we hit those flats, he's gonna shoot us like fish in a barrel. But sometimes what was working for you can work against you. Now, Egg has done an infrared topographical scan of these mountains. There is a minor trail... ...that we could conceivably move our equipment across. And as we come up the backside, we'll use our electrics and run in silence. So therefore they can't hear us. And while they're distracted by the planes... ...we'll come off the mountain and punch a hole through their amour... ...and meet the aircraft in the middle of the Dry Lake. But the critical factor is getting over fast enough... ...and out of the lake bed before they see us. And that's the way it is. [foreboding music in] [helicopter engine] The place is totally evacuated? - Any reports on border activity? - No, sir. None. Colonel? U-huh? Where can they be? [plane engines] TACCOM, this is Eagle Flight, do you copy? I copy, Eagle flight, go ahead. What's your ETA? 0742, how are you boys doing up there? Son, we're flying so low... ...that every time we pass a jackrabbit, I'm looking at it square in the eye. Begin stealth and silent running. [electronic humming] If that's not a holograph... ...we're sure in big trouble. Eagle Flight, when you make your downwind... ...they're gonna throw everything they've got at you. Terrific. They're gonna be preoccupied with you just long enough for us to get moving. Wonderful. Now we're gonna punch a bunch of daylight right through their armor... ...and meet you smack in the middle of that lake. Oh, lovely. I want you to hold for exactly two minutes, no more-- No less. And then pack your bags and get the hell home. Thanks a bunch, Hunter. And I thought it was tough landing at O'Hare. Well, ole buddy... Eagle Flight, you boys in position to play decoy? That's affirmative. If you look around, you should be able to see us. I guess it was meant to be. Reverse left! Aircraft at 10 o'clock. - Ready. - Let's do it. Fire! Do it! [continuous explosions] Numerous malfunctions. Eagle One, you're on your own. - Mind if I call your girl? - Why not? Everybody else does. TACCOM, you just lost half of your seats. Which means you boys will have to leave your toys behind. All units, set equipment for self destruct. Texas International flight through to the Dallas will be landing in five minutes. And it will be standing room only. Terminate silent running and release first volley. [rockets launching] [continuous explosions] [laser pulses] Give cover to corridor E, all units. TACCOM, Dallas, come in? Weakest part of the perimeter, Commander, is the dead centre. I'm gonna blow them out of the sky. Get the plane! You idiot, get the plane! They can't leave without it! TACCOM, it's been pretty hot out here... ...and I've got a major domestic problem at home. Can't help you on the home front, Eagle Flight. But we can take care of your problems here. Watch this. Mayday! Mayday! I read the Commander's down. His monitor's malfunctioning. His monitor's malfunctioning. You copy that, Dallas? Affirmative. You heard the orders, we all get on that plane. [rushing steps] Get in there! Move it, move it! Come on, get in there. Move it! Come on, let's go. Move it! Get on in there. Come on, move. Moving out! Forget the stalled! Faster! Faster! Come on, move! [shouting in Spanish] Come on! Suki, quit playing around and get in here! - We're the last ones. - Didn't see anybody else. Hunter's still out there. Now get on in there. Get on. Move it! Get in there! Hunter, come on back. Hunter, come on in. Come on in. Come on back to me now. - Ace! - Hi, Duke. Oh, listen, I just wanted to say goodbye and remind you... ...that the good guys always win. Even in the '80s. See you, Duke. [laughs] [in Spanish] [explosion] All right, let's get this thing moving. Fire one. Okay, Egg, it's you and me, buddy. One. Two! [jet engine starts] It's Hunter! It's Hunter! Get this crate back on the ground. The boss is coming. Dallas, I'm only a pilot, not a magician. Never mind, just hold what you got. Just hold it really steady. Right where you got it. [yells] That's a boy. Bring it in here. Get over here! Get that damn thing in here. Bring it in! Boy, you gonna get sick doing that kind of thing. Bring it on home. Yeah, I see you too. Bring it here, baby, come on. Come on, bring it in here. [laughs aloud] [hands clapping] [motor bike closing in] Colonel, what happened? [laughs] Alright, compadre. All right, Ace! All right, I'll see you another time! Now, let me say again that while our country deplores the unfortunate... ...incidents that have occurred within the sovereign boundaries... ...of our law abiding neighbor, Camibia, we disclaim any involvement. And we deny any prior knowledge whatsoever. Sir? [whispering] It's an airplane and I think it's theirs. Take her down to 100 feet off the deck! Ready. It's them. Oh, I am glad. What a sport, good old Hunter. You rotten sot. It's all on the wheel, old chap. It all comes around. All right, let's push it. I've got a date in London! [knocking] - Ace! - Hi, Duke. Oh, listen, I just wanted to say goodbye and remind you... ...that the good guys always win. Even in the '80s. [music stops]
