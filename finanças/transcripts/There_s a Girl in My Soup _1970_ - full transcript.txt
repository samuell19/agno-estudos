We never miss your program on the telly. Neither do i. more to your left. This way. Come on there, leave room. Come on, leave a bit of room. It really is too vulgar of you, Robert, To bring your wretched television fans with you. Well, I didn't bring them, dear lady. They simply materialised. How do you do? Oh, don't you know each other? Robert Danvers, Julia Halforde-Smythe. Enchanted. You can ignore the charm, Julia. He's a rotter. Not your style at all. Come on, come on, get back. Let them out. Oh, doesn't she look ravishing in white? Yes. So pure, so virginal. Come along, Julia, I think we'd better move inside. just one moment. Nice smile, please. Thank you. We were saying, Freddie, weren't we, It's such a joy to see someone with breeding on the television, Instead of those young savages with their banjos. Quite, quite. The fellow's as black as the ace of spades, But surprisingly decent. Really? Then some of them are, aren't they? Then would you believe it, the bloody fox turned 'round And set about the leading hound. How very unsporting of it. So they've taken pinkie onto the board. Save him dozing all day in parliament. You know pinkie. Tell me, do you have a proper job? I mean when you're not, uh... Not doing this--this television stuff? I perform abortions. Didn't you know? Excuse me. I hope you'll be able to come to the annual garden fete this year. yes, when is it? Next Saturday. You weren't able to come last year, were you? no, we were away. Oh, yes. Will your husband be able to come with you as well? ...wood off the fairway, and it went on a terrible... Slice? Slice, yes. Do forgive me. I'm going up to change now, Willie. Don't chat for too long, will you? Ok, kitten. Off you go. I must say, she's looking absolutely, uh... Yes, yes. Yes, yes. I mean, she's really quite, um... She is. She is, hmm. yes. What is the word? How would one put it? "Lovely." Yes. Yes, that's it. "Lovely." who's there? Oh, it's you. Am I disturbing you? You're an absolute bastard, coming here like this. I wanted to see you. Why? For one last time. Oh, for god's sake, it was you who threw me over. Claire, how can you say that? You know I was shattered. Not shattered enough to marry me. I know. I was a fool. A blind fool. Oh, Robert, what's the use of saying that now, today? You look stunning today, Claire. Immaculate. Like virgin snow. Do i? My god, but you're lovely. No, Robert. We had 6 glorious months. This is our last time. No, that's out. Isn't it better to end with a bang than a whimper? someone may come in. I locked the door. You only want me for one thing. But what a lovely thing. Who is it? Do you need any help, darling? No, mommy. I can manage. Well, don't forget the plane. Will you be long? tell her 5 minutes. My god, at least make it 10. ♪ for they're a jolly good couple ♪ ♪ And so say all of us ♪ That's a wonderful girl you're getting. She's going to make you very, very happy. Yes. Lose it gracefully, darling. bye-bye, mother. bye, dear boy. Bye, old man. bye-bye, son. Have a lovely time. Good luck. Bye, darling. Weren't they just wonderful? Let's go in now and have a drink. I could do with one. Couldn't you? I must say, she really looked beautiful, didn't she? Well, back to London, I suppose. Weddings always make me feel hungry. I wonder why? We might have something to eat together, somewhere. Hmm. We might. Where's your favourite place? Aren't you the expert? there's a tiny restaurant, uh, rather off the beaten track, that I'd like you to know about. the, uh, menu is limited, but, uh, very tasty and beautifully balanced. as for the decor, it is discreet without being elegant, the seating comfortable, and the atmosphere intimate, whilst the lighting subtly enhances even the most ravishing companion. the wines, too, are well chosen. as a matter of fact, I had a hand in that. although the list is small, as are the number of diners who are lucky enough to eat there, that's not a bad thing. Hear, hear. you see, for my part, I think that far too much attention these days is paid to quantity, and not nearly enough to quality. for example, ah, how is this for starters? Lady heather was right. You are a rotter. You have a delicious flavor. so, having set one's taste buds bursting, we come to the main dish. a sort of shish kebab or skewered lamb. these are meticulously selected cuts impaled with onions and garlic for flavor, and turned over and over a bare flame, until the meat sizzles and the juices run out. for pudding or sweet or afters, I prefer the word "pudding" myself, the banana surprise was a masterpiece. You're wonderful. Mmm, I know I am. But, please, no more. My god, but you're lovely. so there we are, then, a simple little menu that anyone could knock up at home. well, that's all. and until we meet again next week, good night. you have been watching Robert Danvers' good taste. written, devised and produced by Robert Danvers. wines chosen and all dishes selected by Robert Danvers. What's this, then? It won't poison you, you've had it before. I'll bet I have. Cow. Look, I'm not waiting in all night For you to finish that, you know. I know. Evening, john. Evening, Mr. Hunter. Is the connoisseur of wine, women and 2 veg. Back? He is back, sir, but, uh, he's got company. At 6:30? In the middle of the rush hour? I think he's working them in shifts now, sir. I don't know what he's got, But they go in and out of there like a women's relay race. Eh, he must be very, uh, fit. You should see this one, sir. Whoa, legs on her right up to her bum. Not like my missus. Her ass comes down to meet her knees. John, taxi, please. Right away, sir. Andrew, you're early. No, as a matter of fact, I'm a bit late. Ah. Uh, you two know each other? No. Hmm. This is Andrew hunter, editor of a magazine I write for. how do you do? And, uh, this is, oh... Forgive me, what did you say your name was? I didn't. ah, yes, of course you didn't. How stupid of me. Uh, we have a taxi waiting. Nice to have met you, miss, um, uh, miss, uh... That's it, miss, uh... Stay tuned, back in a moment. Your supper's gone stone cold. All right, I'm coming. Don't know why I waste my time. You ought to have some women to deal with. Wish I had. Nothing like home cooking, john. No, sir, nothing. What a slob you are, Robert. What? You treat your sex life like a continuous wine-tasting. Roll them around and spit them out. I know why married men live longer. Hmm? They're half-dead already. Nonsense. All that sex is just a substitute for the real thing. Who needs the real thing with a substitute like that? daddy, daddy. Daddy, Abby won't let me kick the ball. You have to get it off her, that's the game. But she keeps picking it up. Well, kick her, then she'll put it down. Ok. Anyway, it's time you gave up all this philandering. How old are you now? 40-What? About that, yes. ow! Daddy! Daddy! Don't bother daddy now, Abigail, he's busy, hmm? But Barnaby kicked me. Well, kick him back. All right. Come on, now, Andrew, admit it. Wouldn't you give your eyeteeth To be single, just for one week? Not for a day. All right, you're too senile for sex. I am not. Andrew! Yes? Oh. Yes, darling? Andrew, have you been telling the children to kick each other? Kick, darling? Well, no, not exactly. Honestly, you're hopeless. Just look at you. You're the same age as me, But you act like my grandfather. Well, if you didn't rush off to that health farm every 5 minutes To have your flue raked out, you'd have clinkered up years ago. Who on earth is this? Can't you look at a girl without actually lathering up? telephone, Mr. Hunter, from France. Ah, that'll be about your wine-tasting trip. they are waiting for you, monsieur. Thank you. You'd better hurry, hadn't you? Do give it a rest, old chap. You speak English, do you? Yes, but, uh, only very, very small. Paola! Paola! Airplane, airplane, please. But you're so heavy.

Uh-huh. Anyway, he's a gas fitter's mate, that's his real job. Uh. Can I have another one, please? Oh, yes, yes. Of course. Uh, were you leaving, just now? Did you think I was? I wasn't sure. I was just trying to keep one-up on you for a bit longer. One-up? I was looking for your name on the door. You mean you don't know my name? No. Nor who I am? Should i? It's just that I was under the impression-- What is it, then? What is it? Well, uh... I am Robert Danvers. How nice for you. Who am i? I've no idea. See? You see, we haven't exactly been, uh, formally introduced, have we? What is your name? Marion. Marion. Hmm, how beautiful. Can I have another drink? Look, if you're going to pour that stuff down you, Wouldn't you care for something to eat? Can you cook? Within reason. What would you like? Bread. A piece of bread. Just bread? To soak it up. Yes, of course. What are you, a mortician or something? What? A mortician. This is the kind of music they play in funeral parlours. I've been wondering about you. Why? And interested. In what? Why do you always answer a question with another question? Why do you? Yes. You wanted another drink? Are you trying to get me tight? You're frightening enough sober. Um... That chap you were, um, chatting with on the pavement... You mean making it with? I suppose I did. He just happened to be passing. Hmm. Tell me, um, Do you often, uh, make it with chaps who are passing? Sometimes. Do you? Not with chaps, no. Uh... Keep still a moment. What's the matter? You have a speck... Just... There. There you are. Thank you. What's so funny? Nothing. Oh, good. That party, what was it, eh? Drink or drugs? Who cares? Hmm. Amazing thing, progress. A few years ago, a bottle of Spanish wine And an aspirin, last word in sin. You sound just like my father. Thank you. Oh, I've upset you. No, no, no. You're sore. No, I'm not. No. Then why are you back there? Well, it's, uh, more comfortable And I can see you. And you're very pretty to look at. Yuck. "Stunning" is the word that, uh, springs to mind. Oh. Have you got to get home? Why? You keep looking at your watch. I'm timing you. Timing me? Well, you didn't bring me here to look at me. I was under the impression that you brought me. Oh, wow, next you'll be shouting "rape." If you like, yes. If I like? It took you exactly 9 minutes and 40 seconds To say something even remotely connected with sex. What was that? There's always a bit of yak about sex before the pass. It's to get you in the mood. To get who in the mood? The girl. You're already in it. Having got around to it, you come and sit next to me That took another 20 seconds, that's 10 minutes in all. Most fellows I know would have made A grab as we walked through the door. They're too lazy to chat you up. They walk around in their tight jeans so you can take a good look at the goods And make up your own mind. But you, you don't put the goods in the store window. You bring me home, and prove to me you're loaded, And some drop big hints about who you are, And I'm supposed to be all impressed, And run back to my girlfriends and say: "Hey, guys, guess who did me the big favor last night?" You don't even like me, do you? I don't know you. I mean, the, uh, look of me. You're no chicken, are you? So, why did you come home with me? Why not? Mmm-hmm. And if I made a pass at you now, what would your reaction be? Oh. You want the results before you place the bet. What do you reckon the odds are? Look, may I ask you a question Without getting a question in reply? It depends. Why did you say just now you wanted To keep one-up on me a bit longer? Supply and demand, I suppose. I'm in demand, and until I supply, I'm one-up. And a bit longer? Oh. The final result is never much in doubt, is it? You ought to watch that little laugh, it's a dead giveaway. My dear girl, I don't think I could cross that bit of floor between us, Any more than I could climb everest. Don't worry, you'll manage, sooner or later. You're so cold-blooded. And what about you? Me? Do you want to marry me? What? Do you? No. Do you want to pay for it? Pay for it? Good god, are you-- No, just establishing. You don't want commitments and you're too stingy to pay-- My dear girl, it's not a question of stinginess. All right, let's put it another way. You think it would be an insult To your virility if you had to pay. So, here you are, you're onto a good thing. No complications and no cost. If that's not cold-blooded, what is? Absolute nonsense. Your argument implies a--a--a form of sexual bartering That no longer exists. Oh, crap. What? Crap. Crap? Crap. But your attitude negates the whole fun of being male and female. The whole artifice of flirtation and love-play. The final mutual pleasure. As a matter of fact, there are some people who'd say That the, uh, female gets more pleasure-- You mean I would enjoy you as much as you would me? Oh, probably more, yes. Oh. Granted, you're prettier than I am, but, uh, A man, a mature man Has something far richer to offer than mere good looks. That's fabulous. How old are you? 19. Good god. How old are you? Cigarette? Well, you've crossed that bit of floor. What is it? What's the matter? It's all right, I don't mind if you want to have me. Thank you. It's about the most beguiling invitation I've ever had. Don't you want to? I want to very much. Where's the john? What? John? Oh--oh, through there. Hey, uh, Maybe I'd better go now, before you get too worked up. No one could possibly accuse you Of being over-romantic, could they? What do you expect? Just that you might show a bit of enthusiasm, that's all. Do I have to enjoy it, too? That was the idea of it, yes. Well, do you mind if I skip the ecstasy bit this time? We'll see about that. ♪ my Arabella, Cinderella ♪ ♪ what does she do? ♪ ♪ she turns into a pumpkin at the stroke of 2:00 ♪ ♪ you know, she should have done it way back at midnight ♪ Hey, what are you, a weirdo or something? Why do you ask? All these mirrors. It amuses me. What's so amusing about staring at yourself on the throne? ♪ Cinderella ♪ Hey, you must be a weirdo, that bed's red-hot. Oh, my god, it's the electric blanket. I forgot to switch it off. I'm so sorry. I thought it would take the chill off the bed. Look, um, I know I sort of threw myself at you and... Oh, that's all right. Yeah, well, now I've sort of gone off the boil. Don't you worry about that. I'll soon put you back on it. It's just that I wouldn't want to disappoint you. You won't. And I'm willing to bet that I won't disappoint you. Ok. You know that party? Yes. Well, it was my party. Yours? Well, I live there. I guess you could call it that. Oh, yes, yes. And that guy on the drums... Yes. His name's jimmy. Oh, yes, of course. You know, when I first got here, I went with a friend of jimmy's called mark. Mark? Suddenly, he became horrible to me. So jimmy got me to leave mark and come and live with him. And now jimmy's been nasty. Oh, dear. Bryan was kissing me when you saw us, And trying to get me to go with him. Bryan is jimmy's friend. Oh. Good, yeah. He said that jimmy asked him To take me over and get me out of the way because of Caroline. Good heavens. And I know that 'cause 2 weeks ago, peter made a pass at me. Peter's another friend. Uh-huh. Only I don't like him, so I didn't go with him. Anyway, it's just as well, because he's in the hospital with the dose. Caroline's Bryan's girl And jimmy's got her now. That's how jimmy got me. They're all passing me around like a tray of cakes. Just have a nibble and pass her on. You know, um, It isn't very nice being passed around. Where are you going? I thought you wanted to go to bed. I can't imagine what gave you that idea. Good night. Humph, listen to this: "Vicar, 63, runs off with 18-year-old Sunday-school mistress." I don't know what these grown men See in these young girls, I really don't. No. Well, are you going to sit there all day, then? Let me finish me tea, can't you? And there's lover-boy's bagels. He'll be buzzing down for them shortly. Hey, somebody's at the door. then answer it. Morning, sir. Ah, morning, miss. Lovely morning. Is it? Slept, uh, well, I hope? Why? Didn't you? Me? His lordship, uh, all right, is he? I think so. Think so, eh? Look, is there anything I can do for you? Well, uh, actually, I brought his bagels, but, uh... Bleeding bagels. Come along, if you're ready. What did you say your name was? Robert da... Ah, I see you found out. Yes, I am the Robert Danvers. Yes. Right, here we are, off we go. Is that all you do, just eat for a living? And write, teach, create, criticise, appear on television, Buy foods and wines, many things. Oh, yes, I'll, uh, drop you off at your apartment. And then goodbye? That's right, yes. I'd like to thank you. What for? For not having me last night. It was no effort, I assure you. I don't suppose you'd like me to stay a few days? I'm going to France tomorrow. Then your apartment will be empty? And locked up. That's me, the disposable girl. Use me once and then throw me away. Well, I haven't used you, so don't come the hard-luck story with me. Thank you. Goodbye. One last word of advice, young lady. You're 19, and what is commonly called a pushover. Now, then, had it been anyone else but me last night-- I know. If you continue like this, by the time you're 21, you're going to... Well, you're too lovely to go throwing yourself at any man, To let them take advantage of you. What's so funny? Just the words you used, "take advantage." I'm telling you this for your own good. Thank you. Now would you do just one last thing for my own good? What's that? Help me get my bags out. I'm sorry, I'm too busy this morning. Oh, yeah, you give advice, but when it comes to doing anything... Just a minute. All right, come on. Now then, what about this, uh--uh, jimmy character? Don't worry, it'll all be very civilised. Hmm. Get up, you sloppy, fat-assed, red-eyed jerk! Oh, Jesus Christ! Come on, it stinks in here. You need some fresh air! Oh, it's you, I might have known. Go on, get your ass out of here. Don't think you're going back to sleep. I want you out of here, you bastard! I do hope I'm not disturbing you. Do you hear me? I'm getting out of this crummy joint! I'm packing it in. for god's sake, do you mind? What the hell's going on? Uh, I think it's a raid. Oh, god. It's the police. the police? Quick, Nigel, where are my knickers? Now, don't panic. They're in my jacket, breast pocket. Come on. go on, get out! I have to pack. Go on, beat it! All right, just don't shout. Christ, my head. Got any aspirin? Not on me, no. Out there, in the bathroom. Get them, would you? There. There. Yes. How could you? How could you, with that hag-bag! Stop shouting, can't you? And that belly. It's either too many buns or she's got one in the oven. She hasn't. Well, I hope she has. I hope her old man makes it with the shotgun, Then you'll be good and stuck. I thought you went with Bryan last night? Did you? Well, didn't you? What's it to you? Oh, don't start that stupid question bit again, for Christ's sake. Why not? I've been worried about you. Worried about me? You lying punk! Pretending you give a damn! Stop. You wanted me out So you could move her in, you louse! Mind that guitar, I tell you. Up yours! Look, will you listen to.... Christ, my head. I hope your head breaks open And all your brains spill out all over the place And you tread on them and fall over. Gruesome turn of phrase, hasn't she? My eyes feel like 2 piss-holes in the snow. Oh, ta. I reckon I could grow mushrooms on my tongue. What about women, eh? Just because I'm moving Caroline in, She starts screaming blue murder. Well, that's only natural, isn't it? Natural? Why? Caroline will be company for her. Cut the housework in half, they'd be laughing. No, it's too reasonable. Frigging women. Tell you, if I didn't fancy them so much, I reckon I'd change sides. Mmm, yes, yes. Well, of course, that's, uh, because she's upset. Upset? Her? What about me? You can hardly expect her to enjoy sharing you. Why not? Most of the blokes I know are having it off with birds all over the place. Well. Well? I just want to get mine under the same roof. Save myself a bloody fortune, mate. Right, we're off. Ready, Robert? Here, hang on. Is he with you? Are you... Ah, look here, Mari, anything's better than that. You can't stay with him. She's not staying with me. Ah, there, see the sort of bloke he is? One night, then out. Anyway, what is so offencive about her being with me? Well, I mean... Shouldn't you know better at your age? Uh, please, Robert, my cases, would you get them? Where did you find that? I don't know how you can stand an old git like him touching you after me. Anyone would be good after you. Oh, Mari, come back. Think of the great times I'll give you. Don't! Don't touch me. Go touch her instead! It's off. Me bloody head's come off. I'm blind, my god, I'm blind! Robert. What happened? Are you all right? Of course I'm not all right. Who the bloody hell did that? Was that you, you stupid, clumsy, bloody twit? Oh, don't you start shouting. You oaf, you idiot, you--you filthy, awful wreck! God, I can't see-- I can't see anything. Here, cut that out. I don't like it. Then don't watch. Why the hell I got mixed up with you Juvenile delinquents, god only knows. Oh, shut up. You're not the only one who's hurt. How dare you tell me to shut up. I'm practically bloody blinded here. Oh, give him a white stick and kick him out. Get lost, you. I can't see anything. The string in my eye's gone. Oh. Honey... You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Making up to an old geezer like him. Oh, I'll bet you never thought you'd drive me to this. Look, that's enough. You are the most arrogant young idiot I've ever laid my eyes on, What's left of them. You imagine that if a woman even looks at you it must be love, And that any man over 40... Uh, 34... I mean 35, must be repellent. Well, let's face it. Chicks don't go out with old geezers like you For their lovely profiles, do they? I can beat you to any woman. You what? Yes. Any woman, any place, any time. Come along, Marion. Goodbye! Here, you'd better watch out for your truss, mate! Did you notice he was really jealous? I mean, he really flipped out. Hmm, I never thought he gave a damn. Saying those things to put me off, too. Oh, you have had a lousy time, haven't you? Mmm. All this trouble, A smack in the eye and not even a quick flash to show. We still haven't decided where we're taking you yet, have we? I don't know what he was talking about. You kiss very well. There has been the occasional female in my life Who hasn't found me Completely repulsive. My god, but you're lovely. Oh, my god, but you're corny. Oh, oh, Save it. Hey, save it. All that's fine in theory, but it doesn't work in practise. Mmm, where did you learn to make love, in a laboratory? Now where are you off to? Cigarettes and things for after. As a matter of fact, it was the drive-in movie. What was showing? I never did find out. Why? I'm curious. No, I know it wasn't that. Anyway, from where I was, I couldn't see too well. Ah, good girl. Now what? How very romantic you are. I ought to bloody well put you across my knee. Ok, come on. Come on. What's the matter? Can't you stand the pace, hmm? No, I can't. Middle-aged romeos should lay off young girls If they can't stand the pace. Come on, you'd better go. Go on, get out. You really want me to? Passionately. Oh. Now what? I love you. Oh, for god's sake, don't start that. Don't you want to try again? No. You sure? My god, but you're... Oh, come on, come on, say it, please. You are. You're very lovely. And so are you. You're very nice, handsome. Aren't you going to, uh, Take advantage of me now that I want you to? I should. Don't worry. I promise I won't laugh. Aren't you going to take his bagels up, then? He'll ring down when he wants them. Oh, Got another one up there, has he? Yes. Is that all you've got to say? Yes. Be a nice world, wouldn't it, if all men carried on like him? Yes. ♪ Di-dee doo-doo doo-doo ♪ Morning, john. Good morning, sir. Is his lordship up and about? I don't know, sir. He's been very quiet, very quiet since yesterday. Has he? Good morning. Well, can I help you? Is himself in? He's in the shower. Ah. Would it be convenient if I waited? I suppose so. What do you think? Oh, I think it'd be delightful. Thank you. I've, uh, brought along some proofs for him to check Before he leaves for France. By the way, my name is Andrew hunter. So you're Andrew? Yes. Hmm. Would you like some breakfast? Oh, no. No, thank you. I made breakfast for him. You did? Yeah, pancakes and maple syrup. Good heavens! Do I amuse you? Oh, sorry, it's Robert's description of you. I imagined someone quite different. Ah. Not quite the young Apollo you see before you. No, not quite. Uh-uh. Don't you want to sit down? Thank you. Yes, Robert has this thing, you see. He does this transference business. He sees himself as Dorian grey And I'm the sort of verbal picture. You know, I think I will have some coffee, if I may. Thank you. You're married, aren't you? Is it that obvious? Do you mind if I ask a question? No, fire away. Do you ever chase a bit of spare? No. No, no, no, as a matter of fact, I don't. Why don't you? Well, Apart from any question of love and loyalty, It always seems to be such bad manners to one's wife. People always find out. It's rather like picking one's nose in public When one has a perfectly adequate handkerchief in one's pocket. Robert says he won't ever get married, Because he's bound to be unfaithful. How long have you two known each other? About a day and a half. Hmm. And, uh, who brought up the question of marriage? You or him? Oh, him. Only I think he was just covering himself in case I did. Ah, there you are, Andrew, old man. And so I am. Here we are, the proofs. Oh, good, good, good. Darling, you'd better go and pack. Ok. I'm green with envy. What? Oh, yes. She's a cute little thing. Where on earth did you find her? Oh, we met, she fell for me, and here we are, you know. I don't like that. All right, we'll scrub it. And, uh, you're taking her to France with you? It seems to be a good idea, yes. To the wine-tasting? Yes, well, why not? Ah, now, you see. That... That is Danvers. That must be the projected image. Right, good, then we'll use it. Well, I must offer you my heartiest congratulations, old boy. She is a doll. Mmm. Now that's what I call going out in a blaze of glory.

She is. Extremely so. Incredible in one so young, eh? Does one have to be senile to be intelligent? That's what she said. She seems to see right through things, you know? You mean, the close proximity to you has enabled her to realise That while the fabric may be decaying, the structure is still sound. Well, let's just say that she enjoys being with me. I teach her a lot. Hmm. Such as cooking. Among other things, yes. Thank you. Well, then, now you have something in common for the long winter evenings. There's one big difference, though.

They're in there. I'll show you. Andrew, will you show him, please? It's too late, old chap. Please. Marion, don't go with him. I've got to. I'll take you around the world, anything. I can't.

Share myself out? I can't make do with half a woman. No, no, no. A whole woman, half the time. Sounds like paradise to me. You mean instead of him getting 2 birds, I get 2 fellows? More or less, yes.

I knew you were perverted the first time I saw you. How would you like me to suggest that to your eldest daughter? She's only 8. You're lucky I'm a pacifist, otherwise I'd give you a kick in the cobblers. Leave him alone, both of you. He's only trying to help. Come on, you. Take it. Don't hang about. You're smashing.
