[music playing] (SINGING) Standing at the point of indecision. Waiting for a sign to point the way. And lost as I can be. Desperately searching in the shadows. Blinded by the light of love's elation. Anyone is easily led astray. It's the red in what it seeks. Broken dreams that leave us in the shadows. Thanks for coming. I'm not crazy. It's about time. All right everybody, freeze. Listen up, gentlemen. I have a warrant here for the arrest of Albert Shwanker. Is the suspect on the premises? What's the charge? Illegal parking in a red zone. [cheering] Thank you, gentlemen. Any time, pal. Happy birthday. For my friend who's getting married, my best man, the guy I've been drunk with more times than anybody else. [music playing] Oh, you made me drop it. Get a grip, Susan. Oh, I'll get it. Who is it? It's the doc. Dr. Quackenbush, come on in. You're just in time. Somebody has taken ill. We can't have that. OK. Who's the patient? No. It is you. No. Yes it is. Yeah. She's warm. Open your mouth. All right, girls, the closest hospital's about 10 miles away, so it looks like we're going to have to operate. [cheering] [music playing] Get it up, baby. Nurse, any place around here I can get decent? Oh, yeah. Come with me. I think he wants to freshen up a little bit. You can change in here. Here's your money for the telegram. Thank you. You know what? The last party I was at, the stripper gave all the girls a good night kiss, in private. Well, nurse, I think I do have a time for one more house call. Oh, yes doctor. I think I do need a thorough examination. [music playing] I got more where that came from. Thank you for everything. Good night. See at the wedding. What a mess. Christy, I'm surprised you didn't go for a kiss with the male stripper. He was so hot. I'm sure he was. The last thing I need is rumors flying around the airline about me and some male stripper at a bachelorette party. I'm thinking about trying to patch things up with Rob. You haven't heard, have you? What? He's been dating Yvonne Lithgow for the past month. What? [music playing] Officer. Nick, why do you keep wearing that ridiculous wig and mustache? It looks so stupid on you. There's going to be no shots of my bare ass on some sleazy tabloid. Please, you should be so lucky. It's going to happen. You just wait. I'm going to get my actor's card. Then I can tell everybody how you used to be my boyfriend, right? How was the gig tonight? Same old grind. Any of the women come on to you? No. You know how women are when they get a little liquor in them. How about you? The usual. Bunch of desperate creeps trying to cop a feel wherever they can. You know how it is, right? You didn't take everything off tonight, did you? Here we go. You better let me know if anybody ever tries anything on you, April. Come on. Let's not do this tonight, OK. You know I love you. Come here. [music playing] (SINGING) Another time and place. Another lonely face. Another foolish grin to let the games begin. I thought that you and I were only passing ships riding on a pleasure cruise that flowed between our lips. I would've passed on by if it wasn't for your charms. You hit me broadside and I sank into your arms. You hit me broadside and I sank into your arms. Christy. This is a surprise. Rob, I have really missed you. I have really, really missed you. I was just on my way out the door. I have to go to O'Hare today. Looks like a great day for flying. Rob, I am so sorry about the way things ended. I was drunk. I will never let it happen again. I promise. I promise. I've already started seeing someone else, Christy. Yvonne, right? You know her? Well, we used to fly the Dallas route together. Frankly, I find it a little hard to believe that she would do something like this to me. Christy, I thought I was quite clear that it was over between us. Rob, it's only been a month. She could have at least waited a little bit longer than that to jump your bones. For your information, Yvonne and I have been celibate so far. When did you become a monk? Yvonne and I have a different kind of relationship than the one that we had. That's not to say it wasn't fun at times. But for a relationship to work in the long term, there has to be more involved than just sex. So what was I, your little wind up doll? No Christy, it wasn't just that. Please, Rob. Please forgive me. I love you. I would do anything for you. I can't live without you. Please, Rob. Christy, I'm sorry. It's too late. Yvonne and I are getting married at the end of the month. I got to go. [phone ringing] Hello? Yvonne? It's Christy. Hi, Christy. I haven't heard from you in a while. Are you still doing the Dallas route? Yeah. Where have you been flying? Mostly Honolulu or New York. Lucky you. Listen, I just heard the news, and I wanted to congratulate you and Rob on your engagement. You're not mad at me? Me? I've been over Rob for a while now. I'm just glad to hear that he's found someone that he's compatible with. Has he been able to cure his problem yet? What problem? Oh, you know, his impotency. I didn't know about that. Oh, so the two of you have already done it? No. But you used to tell me about all those wild places you used to do it in. Yvonne, friend to friend, I shouldn't tell you this, but you got to promise you'll keep this under your hat. Promise. I lied about all those times with Rob to protect his reputation. You know how fragile men's egos are. I can't believe he never told you about his injury in the Persian Gulf War. No, he never said anything. Please, don't tell him I told you that, OK. I mean, you'll find out about it anyway. I mean, one day he's going to pull it out and it's just not going to be there anymore. Well, anyway. Oh, Christy, I wanted to invite you to my bridal shower this Sunday afternoon. I'd love for you to come. Oh, I'd love to. Where are you having it? Rob's letting me have it over at his house. Some of the pilots are giving him a party at the same time someplace else, so we'll have to place to ourselves. I'll be there. What time? 5:00. See you then. Oh, and Yvonne, thanks for inviting me. Thanks for being such a good sport about the whole thing. Like I said, it's water under the bridge. See you Sunday. Bye. You'll get yours, bitch. [phone ringing] Yeah? Hey, Leslie. Yeah. Tonight? Yeah, sure. OK, Brentwood, 8:30, birthday, cowboy. Yeah, I think I can rustle something up. OK, what's the address? Hey, I just did, I just did the doctor thing there last week, didn't I? I hope I get callbacks like this on my acting auditions. Yeah. Right. See you. [music playing] Howdy, madam. I was just branding some of my stray cattle in the neighborhood, thought I'd stop by for a visit. Come on in. Much obliged. So it's your birthday, baby. Save it for the cattle, cowboy. It's not my birthday. It ain't? I mean, it's not, it's not your birthday? This is 1691, right? I'm the one that ordered you. I decided to take a rain check on something I missed out on the other night. Yeah? The good night kiss? Oh, yeah. Well? It's not the kissing part that I'm interested in. Cowboy, you're in the wrong business. You ought to be a gigolo. The way this job's been going lately, I don't know that there's much of a difference. Only you'd be much better paid. You really think so, do you sweet cheeks? How would you like to make an easy $1,000? What do I got to do? Same thing you just did with me. Thank you, Laura. [door knocking] Now who could that be? I thought everybody was here already. Good evening, officer. What's the problem? Yvonne Lithgow? I'm Yvonne Lithgow. What's wrong? Well, I've got a warrant for your arrest here. What? Before I read you your rights, I want you to have a seat. Yvonne Strickland, you are guilty of violating civil code 41.3 section 4. The offense is being too damn pretty for your own good. Oh no. It's one of those funny telegrams. Which one of you sent this? This warrant is signed by Captain Robert L. Strickland the third. It's from Rob. The captain wanted me to make sure that the punishment was swift and fit the crime. [music playing] [door knocking] Pizza's here. Bring in the pizza. I'm starving. You're always hungry. I'm looking for Captain Strickland. Come on in. All right. [cheering] I told you guys I wouldn't like one of these. [cheering] If I could have everybody's attention please. On behalf of the flight crew, I'd like to welcome you aboard Miss America flight 269 with nonstop service to Bangkok. Our flight attendants will be serving fresh tacos during the flight. So sit back, relax, while I demonstrate our new emergency landing procedures. All right. [cheering] We're ready for takeoff. Is everyone buckled up and ready for takeoff? All right. Let's burn some rubber on the runway. Work it, baby. [music playing] I'm going to kill you guys for this. Somebody help me. [music playing] Hey, Yvonne, you don't have a place around here I can change, do you? Sure. I'll help you. I'll show you. You all right? I'll show you. Yvonne, are you all right? I just lost my balance. I'll be all right. Come on, officer. Let me show you upstairs in the bathroom. What has Yvonne been drinking? Fruit punch, same as the rest of us. I'm sure she's just exhausted, you know, planning the wedding and everything. Watch out. You all right? Here's the bathroom. I think I'd rather get changed in here. Sure, if that's what you want to do. Come here. Where are you going? Don't you want your kiss goodnight? Kiss? Who? Oh yeah, it's a tradition for the bachelorette to get a goodnight kiss from the dancer. That's me. This is really something I don't want to do. You don't want to get Rob mad, do you? I wonder what's keeping Yvonne. I don't know. Maybe she's in the bathroom. Look, you, whatever your name is, you were good and everything, but I don't-- please don't. Lie down, will you? Look. [music playing] I don't know what happened. She just passed out up here. Oh my god. Yvonne. Is she all right? She's kind of hot. Come on, Yvonne, wake up. Maybe we should call 911. No. She'll probably be all right. Here she is. What's going on? See, she just passed out from all the excitement. Yvonne, are you going to be OK? I think so. Why is everybody up here? You passed out. I did? Do you remember anything? I remember the policemen. The stripper? Yeah. Something about, I remember him saying goodnight. Something about goodnight. I'll go make a pot of coffee, OK. Here, let me help you. Be careful. Oh, I guess I won't. It's OK, Yvonne. I think that I know where everything is. It's not like I haven't been here a few times before. I'll be back. What did she mean by that? Yeah, this isn't her house. Christy used to be Rob's girlfriend. APRIL: Nick, are you home? I'm in here. There's my Nick, hard at work. So how'd it go tonight? You tell me. How many did you do? Just one, but it was great, a bunch of airline pilots. Really? It's that easy? It's funny. You know, I did a flight attendant tonight and didn't make anywhere near that kind of money. Flight attendants don't make anything compared to pilots, Nick. Oh, really? I just happen to be in one of the only professions where women make more than men. Sorry. You love being a little party favor too, don't you? Oh yeah, I love it. It's just a job, Nick. You took off everything tonight, didn't you? What else did you do for that kind of money? Let go of my arm. You said you weren't going to do anymore of that stuff anymore. Somebody's got to pay the rent around here, little boy. Yeah. So easy for you too, isn't it, being a whore. I'm not your mother. Pack your stuff and get out. Don't you ever tell me when to leave. I leave when I'm ready to leave. You got it? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Shut up. Please don't hurt me. I didn't mean it. I love you. I didn't mean it. I don't ever want you to leave, OK. Prove it. Prove it to me. [music playing] [phone ringing] Hello? Oh, hi, Leslie. No, no, it's all right. Yeah. It went great. Yeah. No, he's right here. Hold on. It's Leslie again. Yeah? You got to be kidding me. This morning? Fastest I can get over, 10:30, 11:00. What's the address? Hey, you've got to get someone else to go over there, OK. I did one for her last week and she's out of her mind. All right. All right. Look, if she calls again, you tell her, you tell her anything, OK. Tell her, tell her, I don't work there anymore. Tell her, you tell her I've been saved, OK. My soul. You didn't tell me she was a virgin. That ain't right. I don't care. I want the tape. How many times do I have to tell you? I threw it away. It's in the trash where it belongs. You go dig it out. Sorry, garbage truck already came this morning. I want my money back. Oh yeah, you want your money back. You want your money back. All right, sure. Absolutely. Let's see here. What have we got. Four, five, choke on it. Let me tell you something else. You stay out of my life, you sick little whore. I'll fix your wedding, cowboy. [music playing] You definitely healed from your injury. What injury is that? Weren't you in the Gulf War? Yeah, I flew an F-16. Weren't you injured? No. Where'd you hear that? It's silly. It's one of those rumors that fly around the airline. It's nothing. I love you. I love you, Yvonne. You're the best thing that's ever happened to me. YVONNE (ON TV): Don't. Sweet baby. If it isn't the life of the party. Nick, what's this I hear about you losing your job? That silly bitch I did the telegram for the other day called up Leslie and told her I came on to her. Did you? In her dreams. Well, then why didn't Leslie believe you? I don't know. I guess she thinks maybe the customer's always king or something. Who the hell knows? So what are you going to do for money now? You appear to be making enough for both of us. And what are you going to do, just hang around all day and watch TV? Yeah, that's it. You want to be the enemy, you go right ahead. I'll show all you jerks. You're going to come begging when you see me on them magazine covers, sexiest man alive. Just wait til you see my wife. Nick, you ever think about maybe growing up, getting a life, maybe living in reality for a minute? Where are you going? Wherever the hell I want to, that's where. [music playing] Hey, how was your flight? Lots of turbulence over Kansas. Did you hear what happened to the pool man? Yeah, I'm reading about it now. Says the brakes gave out. That's the trouble with driving those older vehicles. Things just give out, I guess. Some other pool man just left his card in the front door. Must have just left it. I just got home about an hour ago. Must be a very competitive business. You must be Nick. That's me, Nick the pool man. Rob Strickland. Come on in. Thanks. How long you been in the pool business, Nick? Let's see now, I guess a little over a year now. I'm also an actor. So does that mean if you get a role in a movie, I'm going to have to live with a dirty pool? Heck no, I'm not going to-- I am one step ahead of you, lieutenant. I got people working for me. Oh, so I don't have to worry about it then. I guarantee your pool will be the cleanest it's ever been. I'll scrub it every day if I have to. My mom used to tell me, what was it? Cleanliness is holy. That was it. Something like that. Well now, Paul only used to come by once a week. It sounds like I'll really be getting my money's worth with you. What's your last name, Nick? Simmons. So is the first of the month a good time to pay you? Super. Oh, this is my wife. Yvonne, this is Nick, our new pool man. Nice to meet you, Nick. Pleasure's all mine. Nick, don't you want the check? Oh, yeah. Where's my head? I'm always a little absent minded in the morning too, until I have my first cup of coffee. Yeah. Would you like some? Perfect. Well, I better be heading out to the airport. When should I expect you home? About 8:00, if we pull out of Chicago in time. Isn't tonight the night you have the stay over in Honolulu? No, that's tomorrow night. That's right, Tuesday. Maybe you should have a cup of coffee too. Yeah, I'll grab another cup at LAX. Well, shouldn't you be getting started on the pool? Yeah, the swimming pool. I'm sorry. Where's my head? The coffee thing. YVONNE: I'll bring some out to you when it's done. You don't know how much I appreciate your business, lieutenant. Actually, it's captain. Oh, captain. Aye aye, captain. Just a little early morning humor. I hope you don't mind. You know, the coffee thing. No I don't. I love you. I will see you at 8:00. Hey, how you doing? Listen, I forgot to ask a question. Are you guys are allergic to chlorine? I'm not. How about you, hon? Not that I know of. Great. That's all I need to know. Thanks. See you tonight. Here is your coffee. Thanks, Yvonne. You sure look real nice this morning, Yvonne. Thank you. I don't even have any makeup on. A woman like you doesn't need any. Thank you. You have a nice day, Nick. Yeah. [music playing] [phone ringing] Hello. You've reached the Strickland residence. Neither of us are in. So if you would, please leave your message after the tone. CATHY (ON PHONE): Hi, Yvonne. This is Cathy from Dr. Shell's office. Your OB-GYN results just came back from the lab, and they're positive. So on behalf of everyone here, let me be the first one to congratulate you on your pregnancy. So give us a call and we'll schedule an ultrasound as soon as possible. Thanks, bye bye. [music playing] What? What is it that has you smiling from ear to ear? Tell me. Tell me. What? You're going to be a father. When, when did it happen? It must have been in Maui. But I thought you said you were safe then? Sometimes mother nature has a timetable of her own. I, I, I'm going to-- Yes. I love you. Yes. Oh, hon. Oh, is it all right to hug you like this? I mean, I don't want to hurt the baby or anything. Yes. Yes. [music playing] I thought you were cleaning pools today? Yeah, I was, but I got done early. Hey, Leslie called and said something came in for you at the last minute. Why didn't she just beep me? She said she did and couldn't get through, or something like that. Anyway, here it is right here. I wrote it all down for you. French maid again. Well, it's convenient at least. Strickland? That's that pilot I did a bachelor party for a few months ago. Is that right? It says it's from his Wanalaya honey in Honolulu. Scumbag. Lucky for us. We could sure use the money, so I'm out of here. Good luck now. Hello. What can I do for you? Captain Strickland? Yes. I've come to do some housecleaning. You're the girl from my bachelor party. Good memory. Who sent you, the guys from the airline? No, your little Wanalaya honey in Honolulu. She did, did she? She didn't want the place to get too dirty while she was out of town. Come on in. I'm sure we could find a little dirt around here somewhere. This place is filthy. Why don't you sit down right here. They sure don't make housekeepers like they used to. That sort of tickles. Here, let me take care of it then. I could use a little dusting off myself, you know. I, I think that should be sufficient. Oh no, I don't think so. My instructions were to give your house a very thorough going over. Young lady, I think you've done a thorough enough job as it is. But I didn't even take my clothes off yet. I'm sorry to cut you short, but I'm afraid this is the end of the show. What about what you're Honolulu honey wanted? I'll just have to have a word with my honey about this as soon as she gets back from Honolulu. Good night. [music playing] Rob? ROB: Up here, hon. [music playing] How was Honolulu? Hot. How was the temperature here in LA? Muggy, actually. How was your night off? It was nice. Did she do a little housecleaning while I was gone? That was very thoughtful of you, Yvonne, but to be honest with you, that girl was a little loose. What are you talking about? The French maid. The stripper, the same one that was at my bachelor party. She was all over me. Did you tell her to try to seduce me or what? I didn't send anybody. [music playing] Rob. Hello, Christy. This is a surprise. Would you like to come in? Christy, level with me. You were the one who sent the stripper to my house, weren't you? I don't know what you're talking about. I'm not angry. I'm actually kind of flattered, to tell you the truth. How can you not hate me for doing such an awful thing? I was trying to ruin your marriage. But all you did was just make me realize how much I love Yvonne. I'm still in love with you, Rob. I'm sorry I was so desperate. You're going to have to accept the fact that Yvonne is my wife, and I intend to keep it that way, til death do us part. Can you live with that, Christy? Guess I don't have much choice. The skies are full of eligible bachelors, and there's even more of them down here on the ground. They're not like you. You'll get over me as soon as you find somebody else. Friends? Yeah. Thank you for being so understanding, Rob. Well, thank you for being honest. So would you like to come in and have some coffee, or some-- No, no. I got to, I got to fly to Orlando. I'll see you around the airport. Say hi to Mickey for me. Yeah. Nick? What? I think it's time we had a talk. About what? About our relationship. What relationship? I mean, what about our relationship? What about it? Something's been bothering you lately, hasn't it? What gives you that idea? Come on, Nick, I can tell. Well, you're wrong. There hasn't been anyone on my mind. Is something bothering you? Are you going to have trouble coming up with your half of the rent this month? It's always about the rent, isn't it? You know, I know you're not making nearly as much cleaning pools as you were stripping. Look, I've got it covered, OK. Is there anything else you need to know? Why haven't you made love to me? Sex is for reproduction not recreation. OK, there's more to a relationship than sex. It's been over a month now. I've had a lot on my mind. You just said you didn't have anything on your mind. Course I've got things on my mind. Just tell me what's bothering you then. OK, I don't have all the rent money. There, you satisfied? I had a good month, and I could cover it, OK. I'll say you've had a good month, what with all the fun you've been having at the bachelor orgies. If you're going to be that way about it, you can come up with your half of the rent yourself, tough guy. I'll do better than that. I got a real big part coming up soon, bitch. [music playing] Oh, you scared me. Forgive me. I must have fallen asleep. You know, it's real dangerous for you to fall asleep in the pool like that. You could drown yourself or something. It'd really hurt me to see something like that happen to you. Didn't you just clean the pool yesterday? Yeah. Yeah, I did. You know, if you want a clean pool, it's an everyday thing, sometimes even twice a day. Isn't that a little obsessive? Nothing is too good for you, Yvonne. I'm starting to burn. I'd better go in. [music playing] Hey. Nick, I'm missing over $500. And? And nothing. Are you sure you counted it right? I'm positive. Did you take some money from me? Now why would you even think that? Well, if you don't have it and I don't have it, then where could it have gone? I don't know, April. I don't keep track of all your money. Maybe you lost it at one of those gang bangs you throw for all the special bachelors. If you don't like what I do for a living, you can just leave. I think we should get a new pool man. What's wrong with Nick? I don't know. Something about him just gives me the willies. Give the poor guy a break, Yvonne. He's just another struggling actor in LA. Could we please get someone else? All right. All right. I'll get out the yellow pages tomorrow. Thank you, Rob. I talked to Christy today. She admitted to the whole thing with the French maid and the pictures. She's still in love with you, isn't she? Yvonne, you're my wife. Christy is just going to have to accept that. Well, I can understand her feelings. I'd have a hard time getting over you too. Any thoughts on what we should call the baby? How about Robert Jr? No, I'm already Robert the third. That would make him Robert the fourth. We don't want him growing up with a monarchy complex or anything. Well, maybe we'll have a girl, and we won't have that problem. Unless of course we name her Roberta. Oh, no way. Listen, I'm going to fire up the Jacuzzi. I was just thinking about taking one. You can't, Yvonne, not with the baby on board. I'm only two months along. Still, just to be safe, OK. I suppose you're right. Guess it's bathtubs and showers for you and me for the next seven months, babe. [music playing] Nick, what are you doing here? Yeah, I left some things here. Came back to get them. What did you leave? Just my woman and child. What? Speak up. I can't hear you over the bubbles. I said Yvonne's carrying my baby, Mr. Strickland. Nick, I think we're going to have to hire another pool man. I don't want to see you around here anymore. Get used to it. I said I want you out of here. [music playing] I'm surprised your husband didn't realize how dangerous it is using an electrical appliance this close to the water. Oh my God, Yvonne. I just heard. My goodness. Oh God. Do you have someone who can stay with you tonight, Mrs. Strickland? It's not good to be alone after something like this. I'll stay with her. OK. Thank you. I don't want to be alone either. You were in love with him, weren't you? Yes. YVONNE: God, then you must be in as much pain as I am. God, I am so sorry about what happened to you. I will regret it the rest of my life. I deserve to go to hell for what I did to you. Hush. Christy, that's in the past. It was just a stripper. Can you forgive me? Yes. [phone ringing] Here. Yes? Oh. Hi. Not so good. Really? All right. Just give me a few minutes and I'll be right down. What was that about? I have to go down to the coroner's office. Well, I'll go with you. No. I have to do this alone. [music playing] Hi. Did you hear about what happened here last night? Mr. Strickland got electrocuted in the Jacuzzi. Isn't that awful? Yeah, it's a real tragedy. I'm sorry to hear about it. You know, you look kind of familiar. Have we met somewhere before? What's your name? Robert. Just like Mr. Strickland, rest his soul. Would you be a sweetheart, Rob-- I mean, Robert-- and get my back for me? It's really hard to reach. Thank you. [music playing] Christy? Christy, are you home? Oh God. [music playing] You're the cowboy. [music playing] NICK (ON TV): Are you Yvonne Lithgow? YVONNE (ON TV): I'm Yvonne Lithgow. What's wrong? NICK (ON TV): Well, I've got a warrant for your arrest here. Before I read you your rights, I want you to have a seat. Yvonne Strictland, you are-- [music playing] Hi Yvonne. You scared me. Nick, what are you doing up here? And why are you in Rob's clothes? I accidentally fell in the pool. And I needed something dry to put on so. Well, you could just keep them on. Now could you just excuse me? Right now, I have a lot going on. Please. I know. I know about all that. I know. But I just, I got something very, very important I got to ask you. OK, go ahead. Ask me. Will you marry me? Nick, I think you've been standing out in the sun a little too long. The child needs a father. You can't raise a baby alone. Very kind of to offer, but I'll work things out. No. Yvonne, I am the baby's father. That's me on the videotape. It's you? That's me. It's destiny. See? Don't you believe in God? That child is mine. And I want you to marry me. And I won't take no for an answer. Stay away from me. You rapist. Think about it. Now, I know our relationship started off in a really weird way. You know, but think of it this way. Most relationships start off really good, and then they go bad. Ours started off really bad, you know. So listen, you've got to trust me. It's all uphill from here. You're sick. You belong in an institution. Oh yeah, that. I went ahead and disconnected the phone, you know. We really don't need to be disturbed right now. I don't want anything happening to you or the child. Now I've decided to move in. We don't have to get married. It's just a piece of paper. I promise you, once you get to know me, you'll see that I'm not that bad of a person. Rape. You obviously don't know it yet, but you're the last person on Earth I'd ever hurt. I'm only doing this because I love you. Can't you see I love you? Now this is what my life is supposed to be about, you, me, and the baby. And as soon as you get that, I mean really get that, I'll let you loose. Until then, we're just going to have to make do the best we can. OK? I know you took the money, Nick. When I find it, as far as I'm concerned, you're dead in my book. YVONNE (ON TV): What's the problem? NICK (ON TV): You Yvonne Lithgow? YVONNE (ON TV): I'm Yvonne Lithgow. What's wrong? NICK (ON TV): Well, I've got a warrant for your arrest. You son of a bitch. I hope you're hungry, baby. You know, one of the things I think you're really going to like about me, I'm a pretty good cook. Hey, you like your eggs better over easy or sunny side up? [moaning] Over easy. Me too. We've got a lot in common. [music playing] [screaming] That's the woman who brought us together. She had to, she had to be killed for the sake of the three of us. Sometimes you have to sacrifice a limb to save the tree. Look, I don't think, I don't think it's time for you to come outside yet. OK? Not until you love me with all your heart. [music playing] You know, it's really not going to work out between us if you keep carrying on like this. You're just going to have to relax and accept your fate. I have. Let her go, Nick. I said let her go. Get out of here, April. This is none of your business. I know what you did, Nick. I saw the tape. You're disgusting. I'm in love with her, April. She's having my baby. Now this is a family matter. I want you out of here. Let her go, Nick, or she's going to get hurt. I'm, I'm going to pull the trigger, Nick. Let her go. Just don't kill anybody, April. It's not in your nature. You hear me? It says in the Bible, thou shalt not kill. Now doesn't it? Are you listening to me? You're a loser, Nick. That's all you'll ever be. [gun banging] [music playing] Oh God. Thank you. [music playing]
