I thought I wouldnever want to eat... ...but thanks to blonde mama... Thought it would be differentwith him too? - Him?- Him. Article 69,the reason why you're in here. He was different. Were you in love? Yes. Did you know what he did? It's all over now. But he... ...was a fun guy... ...a lot of fun. Know what he did once? I did a TV series, six episodes. I was really proud. But no one saw them,not even my mother. He taped themand gave them to me as a gift... ...with the titlesin gold lettering... ...because it wasa beautiful love story. Her name was Vanessa... ...she liked risks, adventures. Does francesca like adventures? Now we can talk calmly. Tell me why I was lockedin this cell... - They killed rosa!- Rosa? What? When? Who?

That's how I picture her. How do you picture me? Just like you are... ...but with your hair down,really long, blowing around. Free. I used to have really long hair. Michele liked it that way. He never wanted me to cut it. But now... Are those all his letters? All of them. I only write to him. When we met... ...I wore a mini skirteven shorter than hair. He followed me all the way homewith his motorcycle! We always made love. The first time,he asked if I was a virgin. To tease him, I said no. He got so pissed off! I never saw him like that. From then on we were never apart. In the afternoon we'd goto a hill full of olives. He knew of a secret passagethat led to a castle. He played there as a child. We'd go there and my fatherand brothers would search for me... My father was a teacher,when he heard I was with him... ..He searched everywhere for me,but how could they find us? That secret passage helpedhim afterwards... ..To escape. Soon he started with robberies,smuggling cigarettes. I always followed him everywhere. I only wanted to be with him. We'd always go back to the hillsto make love. He carved our initialsinto a cactus, it's still there... ...intact. What's wrong? Isn't it all relative? No, it's not. Why, what happened? I'll tell you some other time. - Let go of me!- Make room for branciroli! Didn't you notice? Are you blind? What are we supposed to notice?Take a shower! Got a cigarette for her? Take a shower, then you can smokea cigarette and have coffee. You didn't notice,they didn't even have to ink me... ...to take my fingerprints? Look who's here?A famous actress. An actress? - Liar, you're a big liar.- Why? It's not true,you're fucking with me? Why do you say you're an actress?I've never seen you. What soap opera did you do? She comes back every month. She lies on the train tracksso they can't leave. She likes when train companieshave to reimburse tickets. All first class trains. Fine. Hairdresser at 3:30. - What's for dinner?- I'm not in the mood. Mothers and daughters always fight. I fight with my mom too,then I regret it... Everything's exaggerated in here.It get better when you get out. I don't want to go!See what happened to rosa? I'm fine here,outside it's all such a mess. Poor thing got outand they killed her. They don't kill everyonewho gets out! How would you know?You're from another world. It's a breeze for you in here.You'll be out soon. Don't forget... ...in this world,it's better not to know anything. Hi, filomena. - How's your family?- Good and yours? The actress! The actress! For real? She's so ugly! So different in person! Exactly the same!Just like here! What a guapa you are. So beautiful! You did good changing your name. Valente... It's much more "glamouroso". A few streaks for shine?Some highlights? A few... Who wants coffee? - Would you like some?- I already had some. Have some, it's from the cafe! It's "freedom's coffee"! So good! Your husband's right, you'rebeautiful with your hair down. You look like an elf. How about something different? Short hair, much younger looking. Remember three years ago? You allowed me the honorof giving you a hip cut. When your husband saw it,he liked it, huh? Proceed. Proceed. Take it out on me. Make me lighter. Lighter? What happened? What! You always said youdidn't want to be blonde! Blonde? I didn't say blonder! More auburn. Me, blonde? I don't like blondes. That pale skin,blue eyes... So tasteless! You're beautiful, francesca,you're cute! You're the only cute blondei've ever seen in my life. I swear! I've never seena pretty blonde! - You and Kim basinger.- Exactly alike! Tonino... ...why do men prefer blondes? But they marry brunettes! What's that hand drawn near my bed? With that writing? It was drawn by...What was her name? She was famous.The witch... Silvana! I remember her. She always talked aboutthe importance of dreams. If you concentrate,you can dream whatever you want... ...and you can have what you dream. - Did you put your hand on it?- No. No one's coming? Actually my mom should come. Can you check if she's arrived? She's tall, blonde,we kind of look alike. Thanks. Francesca. My brother! Guapa, huh? How was school? - Wednesday, Thursday or Friday?- Let's say... Friday. I got there late... She's not in the control room,I don't think she'll come. Well, with this heat... My mother can't stand it. She gets nauseous. What's wrong withdi tella's daughter's hand? That was a disgrace! Di tella was a window-washer. She had her daughter with herwhen the accident happened... Is that why... ...she's so full of anger? Why doesn't varialehave visits here with us? Strict regime for her... ...different from yours. Non-contact visits only. They messed her up. When they arrested her,there was a storm of gunfire. But she's so strong,she never complains. Beautiful woman... friendly, too. Friendly... Want some coffee? Yes, thanks. Did you see that girl? Lovely. She's my daughter. Those were your parents? No, my grandparents. - Grandparents?- Yes. Why, you don't have grandparents? No. Sometimes they come visit,sometimes they don't. - Whose turn is it tomorrow?- I have to clean. Thank you, it's beautiful. Fortezza, is it you? I'm alone tonight. I'll sit with you a bit. Let's go now. Let's run away... Tell me something,how did you get this job? I won the public competition. Yes, you have all the requisites. The right body. Patrizia, would you liketo be a hostess? She'd like to be an actress.Right? Tell her. Why don't you do a film with her?She's good. Patrizia, do the judge act. Give me the glasses. Fortezza, you be the cop. Candela... ...lopez. It's me. With a "z" or an "s"? With a "z". Accusation: Article 413... 73, 93, 23... ...69! - Repeat offender.- I beg you! I'm innocent! I have a small daughter,small, small, small. This small. Will you cooperate? No. In the name of the Italian people,I condemn you to 25 years! Next. I told you she was a good actress. They built a hotel on our hill. A hotel for couples. We'd go therewhen he was on the run. The secret passage was a few metersfrom the fire escape door. We'd always get the same roomright near it. It could have been usefulfor escaping. There was a big cavewhere they'd light fires... ...to burn the weeds. "You are the paradiseof my inferno." That's what Michele said. We loved each other so muchin that place! It wasn't alwaysa bed of roses though. Once he startedgoing to that hotel... ...a bad period began... They were on his back. It was useful... ...that secret passagehe knew as a child. Once we fled. We ended up in the ruined castle,like years ago... ...when we were young. Know what torments me? You know how tree branches arewhen they get dry? Well... ...women's skin, as it ages... ...becomes dry, just like that. I'm afraid that if I spendmuch more time here... ...what will he think of me? I knew it.# I knew I shouldn't have gonethat day. But I wanted to see him!Someone ratted on us. They caught micheleas he was arriving. I saw them arrivewhile I waited in the hallway. So many shadows! The door didn't open,they'd blocked it. And then all that blood! Variale, groceries! Di tella,there's something for you. For me? Virgen Santa! Silk is lovely, but it sticks. Lovely though. You like it? What size are you? Size 4? Okay. - A little water?- Thanks. Thanks. I didn't say anything before... ...because I get embarrassed. I have a lot of pride. - Want to come play?- No, thanks. Let's hydrate our skin. What's the occasion?Even variale gets to come out! How nice! Isn't it great? Feels like caresses. Go like this. "The wind arrives,guest of honor at our party. What noise, but it's not him!He is silent. It's the leaves that applaud,tree branches that speak... ...what commotion! The wind was kind,but one day it saw a leaf... ...that believed to be a butterflyflying higher and higher. 'You can't',whispered the leaves. So the wind became a hurricane,the applause roared... ...and the laughter wailed. But in the midst of all that pain,a voice... The leaf shouted at the wind:'Harder! Now I'm really flying,I'll return to my tree." Put a piece of this in. - How pretty!- It's wonderful! Look what Diego sent you! - Look at his pool!- Nice. Perfect color for you!My brother has some taste... Thanks, candela. You knowthat we read all letters, right? Here. This is for you. - What's wrong?- My father has to be operated! I have to go visit him,what'll I do? - Calm down!- He's gonna die! Calm? I lost my motherthe same way... I got thereas they were doing the funeral! Now we'll writea nice letter to the lawyer... ...so you can visit your dad. Where's the lawyer?Haven't seen him in a year! Poor dad! Calm down, it'll all be fine. Make them like that. Stay still! Francesca. Come here. How lovely! Michele's so romantic! Do you have a photo of him? What eyes! Emerald green. He likes my eyes too... ...he says they're like a cat's... ...and also that I'm cleverand agile like a feline... ...that's why he never left me. "Where would I finda cat like you?" His passion scares me. I'm afraid it'll endat any moment. But he says no. Is it still like it wasin the beginning? He desires me even more. How can it be? Have you ever taken a bulletfor a man... ...because you wanted to see himat all costs? Have you ever been in a cavefor three days... ...without eating, drinkingor washing yourself... ...just to be with him? Cops waiting outside... That's how we do it. Michele would be proudof one thing... ...the day of the arrest... ...I hid a note under a statueof the Madonna. That note contained proofof my complicity. We need a helping hand... ...the hand of a friend, a ghostto enter through that door... ...and exit without a problem. Will the eggplant parmesanbe ready for dinner? We only have one burner! They say tomorrow there'll be moreshooting stars than today. But tonight is the nightof the shooting stars! If mine appears, we meetat the obelisk, right? We'll have to see if mine appears. Yours already has appeared,you're a nice cica... ...you travel the world, on boats! Have patience, you'll be out soon. Nowadays, prison addsa bit of "glamour". - Here, I'm done.- Girls, tomorrow, fish! - I like fish too.- I own a fish store. - She's good at layin' it on!- Don't listen to her. I have baby squid, date mussels... Those are illegal, but ifyou let me know beforehand... ...I can get them for you. It's a risk, but for you... What'll we wish for tonight? - That's mine.- Yes, I saw. I haven't even seen one! There, look! Where are they? I saw mine, I'm going to bed. So many shooting stars tonight! You have to make my star appear. How? I must see Michele again. I need to! Even from behind the window...No matter what! Listen to me. You can do it. That note... ...you have to get it out of there! You'll be out soon. If they find it,I won't see him until I'm old. I'll die in here! Quiet! Francesca, it's cool here! My goodness, the eggplantis still on my stomach. You're down, huh? I don't feel very well... ...could I go to the infirmary? Come on, you have great lawyers. You don't like it here? Don't sleep well? Is it di tellawith that loud music of hers? Too much commotion. You don't like it, huh? No, it's that... Want to stay in the infirmary? Want to change cells? - Why, can I?- Of course. With a written requestlisting the reasons. Maybe it's patrizia with her music,and this heat... What was the name of the womanwho died last week? Rosa iacone. - Why did they kill her?- She had too many friends. So, you want to change cells? See? I'm leaving. Thanks, blonde mama! Guard, get the van ready... See? She's coming. I'm really leaving! Di tella, move. Get out of the way! It's hot, where areyou putting her?

She won't talk to me! You, be ready at 9:00. Going to ischia this time? She'll go, she'll go. You'll go home, see your friends,and forget about it all! It'll all be like a bad dream,like... Have you ever eaten blonde mama'ssweet and sour peppers? You can't sleepand you wake up all sweaty! It went well! I'm leaving! Something happened to cettina? Cettina's fine,she's in the infirmary. Candela's boyfriend got arrested. I'm sorry. I'm not, I hope he dies in there! Can I tell her? When they arrested him,he was at a friend's house... ...with a blonde! - A blonde?- A platinum blonde! Pig! I'm here because of him. Get it? I left it all for him... ...my family, my country... ...my daughters! I'll take care of him! I'll bust his ass open like this... ...dates, names, and times.

Sold it all, blonde mama. Should've seen that lawyer!Jacket, tie... Where'd they get him? He said it's importantthat I have a small child. Francesca,can you explain something?

Here. - Thanks.- Don't get used to it. I have daughter. Two. Two kids? Even better! No, I have daughter,two years old. Where she is? Capo Verde, I born there. - Where's that?- In Africa. Africa? Nope, no chance. Business is good,the coffee is almost finished. Too bad we don't have cocoa... ...we'd make good money. I'll go right back to Spain. What was the other guy like,the one arrested with him? A handsome guy? Chubby. Maybe the blondewas with the chubby guy. Really? With the chubby guy? I already got two anonymous letterssaying I was being cheated on... ...but I didn't payany attention. I ripped them up. Anonymous lettersare always written out of envy. You're so attractive... who knowshow many women are envious of you! You think I'm attractive? I think I'm fat. I gained at leastfour kilos in here... ...all on my rear! When will this nightmare end? The wind is back. Yes. So, you're leaving soon. Will you send us a postcard? Of course. Who knows if you'll rememberyour friend. I'd never forget you. We helped you passthe time, right?
