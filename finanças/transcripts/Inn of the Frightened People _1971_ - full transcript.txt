All those people. - I didn't see Harry there. - He was there. And all my fault... Come on. Oh, you know it was. Come on. Just 'cause you were a couple of minutes late getting to the school. Jenny left the group. I mean, she should've stayed at the school gates till you arrived. Yeah, but I could've got there. I'll see you tonight. Would you be more comfortable if you sat there? Quite happy where I am, thank you. Don't talk to your mother like that, Jill. She's not my mother. Thank you, sir. Well... who'd like a cup of tea? - Good idea. - I'll make some. Give me your coat, love. Come on, Julie. Let me help you. I can do it myself. Jill... I know you're upset. But she is your stepmother. And you must treat her with respect. Let's put these away somewhere, shall we? - You see, Jim, she does blame me. - Oh, come on... ...don't let's start THAT again! - But she's right! - Look, I'm going to to open the bar. Lee's gonna make some tea. Have a cuppa. All right, mate? - Morning, Jim. - Morning. Morning. Thanks, George. - How much? - That's, er, eight bob - forty-two pence. All right for somebody, then, eh?! There we are. Thank you. - Usual, Bert? - Ah, thanks, Jim. She all right up there? - You know the Doc left her some pills? - Yes... ...they're, er... they're on the fridge. Would you take 'em up? Yeah. That's one packet of fags won, Jim - and a box of matches! I must get that machine fixed! Hah! Bad business, innit? There we are. Compliments of the house. Thank you. Gotta get back now. But tonight, if you like, one of us'll come and stand in for you. You shouldn't be working, Jim... ...not today. No, you shoulda stayed shut. Let us thirsty sods go without. Oh, well, I appreciate it, fellas, but, er... Rose is coming in this evening to give me a hand, so we're all right. - We'll be here, anyway. - All right. - Cheerio. - Thank you very much. Bye bye. I do appreciate it. Jim blames me, you know...? Oh, he doesn't admit it - not even to himself... - ...but he does! - No, he doesn't, Carol. Oh, Lee... Two large gins in the corner. All right, mate? That's er, two bob, please, Sid. There we are. I'm sorry about that. Thanks very much. Bye, now. What's the matter, mate? They've let him go, Jim. They let the bastard go. Where'd you hear this? - In town. - Town...? Go through. Will you be all right for a minute, Lee? Yeah. What's all this about, Harry? I've checked, Jim. They've let him go. But they can't have! I checked with the Superintendent. He confirmed it. But why? Did they say why? He said they haven't enough on him to make it stick... to hold him. He's as guilty as sin! I mean, you know it and I know it. 'Course he is! And they know it, too. He as good as said so. But it's technical, Jim. They know what evidence they need to hold him... ...but if they haven't got it, they daren't. The come-backs are too big. What about the come-backs if they turn him loose, eh? First your daughter... ...then mine. Yeah, and he could do it again. Well, I don't understand it. I mean, what more do they need? I mean, he lives there by the school and they've had all those complaints. Yes. The kids won't even go near the place. What do they think he tried to get 'em inside for, huh? Fennel said it was circumstantial. What...? Well, nobody actually saw him take our girls inside, did they? Yeah, but he offered 'em sweets. Well, they can't put him in jail for that! They need proof they were there! Yeah, but they can do that scientifically. Well, they didn't. Or there was some doubt. All I know is they let him go. Well, I suppose there's just a chance that he's innocent. Jim, you don't live down there. I do. I know Seely, by sight, anyway. I know his habits. He... Why don't you come down and see for yourself? What the hell for? 'Cause I want you to. That's why. I'm off this afternoon, Jim. I'll come round. No. I don't want to go down there. Why not? Because if I did... ...I'd probably kill him. That's the house over there. Pull in here, Jim. Sure he's there? Yeah. One of my customers caught a glimpse of him this morning. I should think they're happy. The neighbours. I doubt if they know yet. He lives like a hermit. He must go out sometime. Only to do his shopping. Then it's straight up here and back again. Behind these houses there's a slipway. It runs all the way to the... to the dump. Where they found our girls. Just a wheelbarrow's ride away in the dark, Jim. Look, Dad. There he is. Yeah. That's him. Bastard. Recognise where he's standing? Yeah. This is where Jenny was seen waiting for Carol. Look back there. You can see right up to that corner from his front room. All he'd have to do is to go out the back of his house... ...round, and up... up this road. Here's the school. There he is at the gates, pretending he's cleaning his glasses. Here you are! Catch! Come on, girls, get back into your original positions. I've seen enough. Not yet, Jim. Just keep following him. This is a long way round to the shops, isn't it? He always comes this way... - ...there and back. - Does he? Takes him past the school. He'll stop round the corner, here - he can't get through. Well? What do you say? Just sit here and do nothing? Why...? What's on your mind? I'm not sure, Jim. All I know is that I want to see that man dead. Yeah. Me, too. Yeah, but WE can't kill him. No? Give me one good reason. Well, there's not even a real guarantee that he's guilty. Well, we find out. - How? - Grab him, Dad, make him talk. He'd confess to us soon enough. We could get him to tell the whole story... ...then make him sign a confession. What would he get? A lousy twelve years? Listen, Dad, we grab him first then play the rest ear. What do you say? At least we'll be doing something positive. But how? We could wait here, and... ...get him on the way back. No... No, Harry. This has to be planned very carefully. When's he go to the shops? Most days. Then how about tomorrow? Suppose he didn't do it? We let him go. He'll run straight to the police. We deny everything. It's our word against his, and it's three against one. - Oi! Come on, shoo! Shoo! - Here, clear out! I'll have some of those, please. How much? Eight pence, please. Where are they? What's keepin' 'em? Go on, get out of it! Get out! Get out! Let go if it! Let go of it...! Come on, come on, scat! Let's go! Here! Here! Here! Yearghh! Go away! Go on - good dog! Go back! Go on! Get back! Get back! Go on, go on! GO BACK!! Go on, go on, get back. What happened?! - What happened? - He got away! No, he hasn't! Get after him! - Get him back! - No, don't be a fool! - We'll be spotted! - Get after him! Come on, Jim. Hurry up. Aaargh! NO! Get away from... What do you think you're doing?! I can't see! Uh... Look... Drive him through the tunnel! No! No! No! Don't do it! We'll get him round the other side! Aaargh! NO! NO! NO! NO! - All right? - Help! - Help! - Hurry, Jim. Give him a hand. - Get his legs. - Help! Is that you, Jim? Won't be a minute. Hello, love. Hello. Jill not back yet? No, not yet. I want to hear the news, er... ...let me know when it's on, will you? It's not time for the news yet. And does it have to be so loud? - Hi. - Hi. What're you doing? Just checking some stock. Now, you little bastard... ...you're gonna do some talking! NO! NO! NO! NO! - Bring him round here! - NO!! - What's going on?! - Get her out of here, Lee! Get her out of here! Is that the man that the police had? Yes. Get her out of here, Lee. You... filthy... ...filthy BASTARD! You, you bastard, you... ...BASTARD, you... You get off me! GET OFF ME!! Are you sure it's him? Oh, Jim. What happened, then? How did you find him? Well, for Christ's sake, somebody answer! We were trying to get him to confess, Carol. Hand him back to the police. But are you sure? Are you sure he did it? He did it. Had it coming to him, Carol. You're positive? Oh, Jim... Oh, don't... don't... What are you going to do now? We'll just have to... ...get him out of here. It's Jill! Oh...! - Hello, love. - Hello, Carol. I was just about to... Oh! Your tea! Well, it's too late now. We'll have to do it tonight. After hours. Don't worry, Jim - I'll think of something. I'd better get back now. Linda'll be... ...wondering. I'll be back at closing time. Mmm. How did it happen, Lee? Harry and I'll get rid of the body, I... ...I don't want you involved in this. Oh, sure. Sit back while you bungle us all into jail. I'm an accessory! Coo-ee. We opening tonight? Or shall I come round the back? It's opening time, then. Hello, darling. Oh, come on, Lee - you can do better than that! Here. Thanks. - Evening, Mr Radford. - Evening, Rose. Lee, come here. She can't help in here tonight. You've got to get rid of her. - Yeah, I know, but how? - You'll think of something. I mean, she might go down there. Vegetables and, last but not least... ...our bill from last Thursday. Hey. How about giving the bar a miss tonight? To do what? I don't know. Suggest something. Go to a disco? I can't really well just walk in and walk out again, can I? It's okay with Dad. I checked. Did you? Come on - opportunity knocks. I'll drive you home afterwards. You feeling sexy or something? That's right. Don't mind me. Grab it while you can! Come on. That's it. Time, gentlemen, please! Let me have your glasses, please - drink up. Just one more for the road, Jim. Ah, no, not tonight. Come on. Do you want me to lose my licence? Do you want him to lose his? He's driving. Look at him! What's wrong with me? Well, nothing that a cup of black coffee won't cure. - Come on, lad. - Shut the door! Jim, you're in a heck of a hurry, aren't you? C'mon. C'mon, Jacko. Come on, George. We're not wanted. No good, mate. There's no more. Hey - come on out. - They're closin'! - Come on, Jacko. Yeah, but why should HE have one? Why the hell didn't you come round the back way? I'm sorry, Jim. Everything all right? Ah... You thought of anything? How could I? I haven't had a moment. Well, I have. You know where they're building that new block of flats? Mmm hmm? They're putting in the foundations. Concrete... fresh concrete. All the way down there! Wouldn't it be simpler to bury him in the field? People dig in fields, Jim. Concrete lasts forever. But aren't there arc lights and things down there? No, I've just come from there. Pitch black. Right... Ah, it's, er... it's Lee. Well? What do you think? Come on. All right, Lee? Yeah. Okay. Get the flap open, will you? What's happening? Just get it opened. All right, we'll er... We'll try it. Try what? Go to bed, love, will you? Well, now, you're sure about this? Well, if the mix went in about five-thirty... ...the concrete'll be getting pretty hard by now. We'll dig it up with a fork. But it'll show. Not if we water the surface, stomp it down with a board. - Oh, Christ. - It'll match. What about the noise? We can do it, Jim. Well, where is this? What? Bellfields. All right, Harry. Let's get on with it, then. Dad! Uh...? Uhh... You'd better get out of here, Carol. What's the idea? Be your age, Lee. Get her out. What are you thinking of? Are you out of your mind? Are YOU out of your mind? Look at him. He's a living, breathing witness! Thank God! - Don't be a bloody fool! - Now we can get him to confess! What good do you think his confession will be now... ...with him beaten to a pulp? Look at him! Think we can hand him to the police like that? What do you think we'll get? Kidnapping with violence, attempted murder? Dead, we can lose him. Alive, we're sunk. It's no good looking away, Jim. Harry's right, Dad. - Oh...! - Jim? Jim, it's got to be done. All right, Harry... - ...you do it. - Me? I... ...I can't... - You messed it up. - All right - you finish it. Why should I always do the dirty work? Jim, I mean... ...you've done it, almost. No, Harry. Jim? Please...! No, Harry! You do it! What are we gonna do, then? Just leave him there? I don't know. Maybe we should just dump him. Where? In the street? Picked up by the first cop that comes along? - Yeah, then he'd talk. - 'Course he'd talk. I don't think they'd listen to him. He's a case, isn't he? What about the injuries? Could make it look as if he'd been knocked down by a car. All those scratches? Marks around the neck? Not unless he was completely mashed by a car - killed. Not in my car. Anyway, you're talking as though we're born killers! Well, what are we gonna do, then? Just leave him there? Well, maybe it's the best way! Jim, you can't! You mean... hope he'll die? Well, he is pretty sick. - Oh...! - What if he doesn't die? We'll just have to think of something else, won't we? Yeah, I agree with Dad. Play it cool, leave it till morning. Well, I'm working then, so I can't. Erm... Harry, uh... ...you got us into this so, uh... ...you're in it up to your neck. Forget your work until we've got it sorted out, huh? All right, Jim. I'll ring you about ten, okay? I'm off. Let's hope he does die. - Jim? - Mmm...? Didn't you hear that? Oh, to hell with him! Look, I know it's stupid but whatever he's done, he's a human being. He's an animal. Yeah, well, we don't know what made him like that, do we? Well, I'm going to go downstairs and see what's going on. No. I'll go. Oh, God. Oh...! You just suffer... like you made my Jenny suffer. Some water. Water? Why should I give you water? Why should I give you anything? Why don't you just die? Just die! Water! You want water? Here. There's water! What IS the matter with everyone this morning? Nothing. Go ahead and eat your breakfast. You'll be late for school. No, I won't. That clock's fast. And what's the matter with Lee? Honestly! This house...! Lee? He slept through his alarm clock... ...and when I went in to wake him he threw a book at me! Well, he... probably wants to lay in. You know, we've all been through a pretty bad experience, Jill. Yes, but do you all have to behave like morons? I mean, I do have my exams to get through. You haven't even noticed. Nobody gives a damn. That's not true, Jill. It IS true. If you were my real mother I think you'd have a little bit more concern. Your "real mother" walked out on you! That's how much of a damn SHE gave! That's a lie! You drove her away - the pair of you! From the funeral, too? Did we drive her away from that? Well, it costs money to get over from America! Well, at least she could have cabled. She probably never even got the message! For all I know, you didn't even send her one! You little brat! Get over to school! I don't want to talk to you any more! I'm going! And I won't pass a bloody thing! - Don't you you swear at me like that! - Carol, please, come on. - But... - Please. Now. Calm down. Got your books? - She shouldn't have said that. - I know. I know. She didn't mean it. Go on. What did you say that for? Well, you know how she feels about her mother. And I don't want my daughter upset like that before she goes to school. Your daughter? Oh, yes... I see. Well, you heard the way she spoke to me, didn't you? I mean, you heard that! Yeah. But you goad her. I put up with a load of insults from your precious kids. - Oh, come on, don't start that. - But I've swallowed them... ...because, believe it or not, I'm very fond of them! Now, I know that they think of me just as the... ...barmaid who came in here and took over when their mother left. And they blame me. And I WAS to blame. But I've got some pride left - just a bit. And I'm telling you, if you don't back me up... ...and help me to control that kid... ...I'm gonna walk out of here. OUT. Do you understand? What's happened? Nothing. Well, what is it? Seely? Seely? No. Well, is he still down there? Yep. Don't ask me what I'm gonna do about him - I don't know. I've gotta go to Hooper and Gladstone's to get some washers. You can drive me down. We'll discuss it then. Washers? You think about bloody washers at a time like this? We run a pub - remember? Well, let's get it over. Oh, I feel like I'm in some sort of nightmare. Try not to worry. "Sugar". "Rice". Do you want any meat? Uh... yeah. Get, erm... ...get some sausages. Okay, Fred. On that lock. Come on. How many tins? - Three. - Sweetened or natural? Oh, whichever's easiest. Oh, I'll get natural. I'm going to the health shop, anyway. No! No, don't put it down today! Come back tomorrow. Sorry, love, we're not round this way tomorrow. What's the problem? - It's the cellar. - Cellar? Yeah, well, er... ...the water main... ...the water main's burst, and, er, we've had this terrible flood. - Looks all right to me. - Me, too. Well, we, uh... ...we pumped it all out, but... Oh, well, that's all right, then. No, because the... ...the, the, the Water Board said that we had to, er... ...leave it clear, so that they can... ...come in and do their work, and... Civil servants! She shouldn't listen to civil servants... ...should she, Curly? Don't worry, love. We'll stack it well up in the corner for yer. Ol! Now, look, Mrs Radford... ...I think we should do what they say. I mean, this IS your delivery. If I've gotta take it back, check it off... ...an' put it in the warehouse, I mean... Look - just leave it outside the back door, all right? And then when the Water Board have finished, we'll put it downstairs. Outside?! it'll get nicked! Well, that's our responsibility. Okay, you're the boss. Ah, come on. I didn't know it was flooded. When did it happen? Last night. What a nuisance. You look dreadful. What's the matter? Just got a headache. All that washing, too. Look, you come in and I'll finish the washing. Get the bar all ship-shape and ev... No! Please, just go and get the shopping. Yes, all right. Do you realise what would've happened if... ...those men had gone down into the cellar? Didn't you remember it was delivery day? I can't think of everything. Jim, you've put me in such a terrible position. Look, if you don't get rid of that man now - right now... - ...I'm gonna go mad! - All right, calm down. - Calm down. - Look, I'm serious, Jim, I can't... Now look, will you be QUIET! Look, Lee's got some sort of idea. An accident or something. Something in his own house. We'll smuggle him back there... ...and rig it so that it looks completely natural. With his face looking like that? No, Dad - an explosion. Gas! We'll be miles away, no-one'll be able to connect it with us. We simply loosen a valve in a bedroom... ...shave the light flex till the wires are touching... And when he turns on the light... BOOOM!!! So long as he has gas. We can recce that first. That'll be Harry. What'll I tell him? Tell him to get over here as soon as possible... ...and help us work out the details. Lee, you really think you can get rid of him tonight? With a bit of luck, yes. Oh, God, if you only knew the relief! Evening, Mr Radford. It's Rose. What's she doing here tonight? It's her night off. I don't want her here tonight. I'm going in a minute - you're gonna need some help. No, I don't need her here. Keep her away from me! Look... Carol told her the cellar was flooded. Well, it still is flooded. Get it? She can't go down there. Supposing she wants some fresh stock? Outside the back door. Evening, Jim. Ah, a gin, sir? Ice? How are we for tonic, eh? - Hello, love. - Well, well - surprise. Well, I thought you could use some help. Carol looked rather frayed this morning. Oh - yeah. How are you? Fine. Fine. Hello, Rosie. Hello. Lee. How're we fixed? Be out in a minute, Harry. Listem, um... ...I'm just gonna cut out for a while. You go through and help Dad, eh? Okay. And, uh, the cellar... it's still flooded. If you want any stock, it's outside the back door. All right. - Evening, Bert. - Good evening. A whisky, please. Dad? I'm just going now. - Okay. Recce first. - Yeah. Then, after hours, we'll, er... fix it up. Lee, take care. I'm, er... ...I'm just off. All right? Yeah. - Hello, Carol. How are you? - Hello, George. Two shillings. Thank you. There we are. Orange juice? Help! How're we going to work it? I should think in a bedroom. What the hell is that? Obviously his mother's room. They lived alone here together for years. Have a look at this. Give us the torch, Harry. Lee. Watching this house. Argh! Argh! Oh...! - Another one, Carol. - Right. These pumps aren't working. Oh, the cask must be empty. I'll er... ...change the line. It's time you were in bed. How will he change them with all the water down there? Oh... I don't know. Shut up! Argh! No! N... argh! Daddy! Get back inside! Is he a burglar? Yes. Do as you're told. But his face...! What's happened to him? Shut up, get back inside! I damn well told you to get back inside... ...you disobedient little brat! I ought to belt you! This is what you've all been keeping from me, isn't it? Who is he? What's he done? Just tell me! What has he done? Get inside. I said "get inside". Wait in the sitting room. - Did she see anything? - Don't worry about it, love. I'll fix it. Just watch the bar. And help yourself. Oh, it's working again. Yeah. Great. Well, look, two pints wanted in the saloon bar. Suppose the police find out! They won't. But they'd take you away. It'd be awful, Daddy. You can't do it - and it's wrong! Look, it's too late to argue about that now. Why? You could still hand him over! Jill! We've been through all this before! But the police - they'd understand, wouldn't they? Look, whether they understand or not, we've broken the law. But you haven't killed him yet. I'm not arguing about that. - Dad, I'm not going to let you kill him. - Ah, listen... I'll go to the police myself... Look, if you mention one word of this to anybody, we're sunk! But what if I explained everything?! Listen, even if we haven't killed him... ...Lee and I'd still go to jail. Now, do you understand that? We'd lose the pub... our living. You'd have to leave school. We'd be ruined. Do you understand that? Ruined! I'm sorry that I have to be rough with you... ...but you must understand. Jim! Oh, it's all right, she knows. What happened? The police were there. They're watching the house, we had to get out. Did they see you? Well, it must mean he's still a suspect. Or someone's reported him missing. Either way, we can't take him back there now. Yeah. Well, you got us into this so I suggest... ...you think of a way of getting us out. Well, whatever happens, it's got to happen tonight... ...because I'm leaving for Manchester first thing. Look, mate, you're not going anywhere till this is settled. So get that brain of yours working. Get it working! Well, all I suggest is we dump him. Miles from anywhere. He'll be dead before anybody finds him. - No, Dad, that'd be awful! - Have we got to talk... ...in front of her, Jim? Yeah. Lee, you, uh... you go and help in the bar. And you get to bed. But you can't do it!!! Stop them, PLEASE, Lee! Look, there's no other way, Jill! Jim! There's two detectives in the bar asking for you. What do they want? They didn't say. Sure they didn't follow you from Seely's house? No. You'd better get rid of the car, just in case. Jill! Get up to bed! Tell Lee to bring them through. Ah, good evening, Inspector. Have a drink? Not just now, thank you, Mr Radford. Sit yourself down. You've got some news for me? No, sir, nothing to do with your daughter. Oh...? Er, will you confirm that you own a light-coloured station wagon... ...F-registration? F... er... It... it is F, isn't it, Lee? Yeah. May I ask where you were yesterday evening, sir? - Around five o'clock. - Er... ...in the pub. At between five and five-thirty? Er... we open the pub at six o'clock. Fair enough. Oh, er... ...mind if we take a look at the car? Not if you tell me what it's all about. It's a general enquiry, you understand, sir? We believe that a car of that description was used to abduct someone. "Abduct"? We're questioning everyone in the area who owns a similar vehicle. Yeah, help yourself. Lee, show 'em where the car is, will you? Sure, this way. Er - sure you won't have a drink? Thanks all the same. We have a number of other calls to make. I hope you find the man who killed my little girl. Anything in particular you're looking for? Do you or your father happen to own a tartan car rug? Tartan? No. What happened? Where did they go? - What did they want? - Us. Only it hasn't clicked yet. Dad... they know about the rug. Dad, did you hear me? Hmm? Oh, yeah... they know about the rug. Which means someone must've seen us take him, which means... ...we can be identified. Dad, we've got to get Seely out of here NOW... FAST. Oh, come on, Dad, pull yourself together. It's too late. Oh, JIM! Oh, Christ, what a time to get smashed! - Coffee. Get some black coffee. - No, it... ...doesn't work with him. We've had it, Lee. What do you bloody mean, "We've had it"?! Had it, had it, had it, had it. Oh, Jim...! Come on, Jim. Pull yourself together! Time now, gentlemen, please! Come on now, gents, let's have your glasses. Come on, haven't you got homes to go to?! Come on, it's ten past. Come on, gentlemen, it's well past the time. Come on. Steady on! Good night. Good night. Finish up, gents, PLEASE. Good night. Come on, it's time, please, gentlemen. Finish up, please, now. - Is he still smashed? - Oh, he's in bed and out cold. Did you contact Harry? Well, either his phone's out of order or he's got it off the hook. Bastard. And he's off in the morning. Do you think you could move him alone? These darts matches certainly boost custom. Should ask Jim to have one every night. By the way, what was the matter with Jim tonight? I've never seen him drink like that before. Look, why don't you two go in and relax, and I'll finish up here. No dear, we'll help you. Then I'll take you home. Early bed for you tonight. Well, I'm off to bed. - Good night, Rose. - Good night. Oh, er... ...don't stay up too late. Come on. Come on, darling... just for a few minutes. Look, I'm warning you, I'm tired. Don't be silly. It's just for a few minutes. Please...? Come on. Darling, if you're worried about last night, don't be. I didn't mind. Anyway, it happens to everyone according to the book I've got. I wasn't in the mood. Thought I was, but I wasn't. It's nice, in a funny sort of a way. I mean, having our sexual ups and downs. Like an old married couple. It also says... ...in my little book... ...that it's very important for the woman... ...to reassure the male. Save it, Rose. I'm tired. You are in a strange mood. I'm sorry. You're worried. You are! Darling, it doesn't matter! I love you. That's what matters. Lee...? Rose, I'm sorry. Come on. Lee? Lee? It's the same. I'm no bloody good. Darling, it's all right. Ju... just relax for a moment. You're all strung up. - Come on - lie down beside me. - No! I told you, I'm no bloody good! It's your own fault - I warned you! I'm... I'm tired. I've got things on my mind. Hmm. Sorry. - I shouldn't've as... - You shouldn't've, no! Get your things on - I'll take you home. Lee...? What is it, what's the matter? Is it us? Don't you want me any more? Oh, don't talk so bloody stupid! Well, what is it, then?! I told you, I'm tired! Now, stop trying to cook up something that isn't there, and get dressed! Don't shout at me! If you'd listened to me in the first place... - ...I wouldn't've had to shout at you. - Oh, go to hell! Rose? Ah, come on, don't be a fool. Stick the bike in the back! Is Harry's phone still out of order? Well... ...if you want to, we could, er... drive over there. What's the use? It's all such a... bloody mess. Oh, Lee... Look... ...Rose is... very young... ...and she doesn't understand these things. But when you're all nervous and worried... ...well, then sex can go wrong. What're you talking about? Well, I... couldn't help overhearing just now. It's all that little bastard down there's fault. He's tearing all our lives to pieces. I'm gonna belt him for good! - Oh, Lee, NO! - You go back to bed... ...I'm gonna do what Dad should've done in the first place! You little bastard! I ought to DO YOU!! Lee! No! No! No! LEE!!! Lee, for God's sake, pull yourself together! What's the matter with you?! You were keen enough to kill him yesterday!! Show him what a grown woman looks like! Go on - convert him! Bastard! She how beautiful she is? That's a WOMAN. A real woman! Ever seen a real woman before? - Not just a poor wretched kid! - No! LEE! Lee! Stop it! Lee! Stop it! God...! Lee...! No...! NO!!! God! I just... wondered if you were still here. If you wanted anything. Some breakfast. Carol's! How on earth...? I saw them. Him and her. I saw them. What do you mean, you "saw them"? I saw them! There! THERE! THERE! You swine! You're a revolting filthy PIG!!! What you on about?! Well, now I shall tell the police! - I really shall! - Jill... - ...what's the matter? - Let go of me! JILL! - Jill, what's going on? - You know damn well! He told me! He told me what you did! You and Carol, in front of him, torturing him! You're perverted! Oh, stop pretending! I'm not a half-wit, you know! She left that down there! I'm going to bloody well tell someone! Carol! Carol! CAROL! Carol! You bitch! What've you been doing?! - Jim! - Who was it?! No! Jim! Oh...! - Who was it? - Agh...! - Who was it?! - Lee. Lee... LEE!!! Help me! Lee! Get out of my house, you little bast... Don't you ever come back here again! Get out. Come on! You think I'm some sort of bloody idiot, eh? Stop it! Stop it! - GET OFF! - Jim! Jim...! For God's sake! Oh, Jim! Jim...! Are you all right? Oh, God! I... don't... ...sit down... I don't know what's happened to all of us. Oh, we've all gone raving mad! He's a... ...a bastard! Oh, Christ... Lee... ...Lee... ...Lee! Lee! You all right? Pack your bags. We're leaving. Oh...! I can't leave him like that! Come on. I'll help you. - Well... - Hurry UP! Lee! Lee! What're you doing? Don't go. Don't go! Lee! Lee! LEE!!! Oh, my God. Morning, Mr Radford. What's happened to you? What the hell do you want? Oh, we were just passing, as a matter of fact. Thought we'd take another look at your car, in daylight. Well, if it's not inconvenient. Well, it is. It's bloody inconvenient. "We"? Now, you know it's not in there! - I said just the garage, Sergeant. - Have you got a search warrant? I'm sorry, sir, he must have misunderstood me. Really?! Have you got a search warrant? Ah, no, sir, no. It's just a routine visit. We were going to ask your permission but, er... ...we thought you might still be in bed. Did you? Well, now you've seen it, clear off. I've got work to do. Just a moment, Mr Radford. Do you usually keep that open? Er... my son must've left it open. - Uh... - Er, just a minute, Mr Radford. It's none of my business, of course, sir, but... ...if I were you I'd just take a quick look at my stock. Er, no... Just in case, sir. There seem be be quite a bit of breakages down there. Oh, excuse me. Just a moment, Mr Radford. Just take a quick look down there for Mr Radford, Sergeant. Better to be safe than sorry, sir. There's a lot of it about now, you know. Liquor thefts. They rise with the prices. Bit of a mess down there, sir. Have you had an accident? Mmm. I advise you to keep it locked in future, sir. Just in case. Unless it's drinks on the house. Oh... better get something on that cut of yours, sir. Looks nasty. Goodbye, then, sir. Oh, Carol...! Seely! Seely, are you there? - Evening, Jacko. - Hello, Bert. There's no George tonight, then? Not shown up yet? Half a pint, please Jim. - Bitter? - Cheers. Where's the wife tonight? Er, pictures. Rose? Out with Lee. There we are. Jill, are you in yet? Two-three-oh. Connie... ...Connie, is Jill there by any chance? Yes, Jim, she's here. Thank God for that. I was getting worried there. Do you mind telling me what you've been doing to that poor child? "Doing"? Why, what has she been saying? Nothing. That's what's so worrying. She's in a dreadful state. I'll come round tonight when I've closed the place up. She's in bed now. You'll have to come tomorrow. Now, look, Jim - what's going on? Just a misunderstanding. I'll explain tomorrow... ...when I come and pick her up. I'll be round first thing, all right? - Bye. - Bye. Good evening. Good evening, Mr Radford. Half of draught and a whisky, please. Draught... ...and, er... whisky. Sorry I was a bit sharp with you this morning. That's all right. We're used to it. Er... ...find the car yet? Maybe. Five shillings, please. Hello? HARRY Is that you, Jim? Harry, where the hell ARE you? Manchester. You seen the papers? No. What do... what do they say? We got the wrong man. Wh... wh... what do you mean? It's in the paper. Listen... It says "A man is helping the police with their inquiries..." ..."into the murder of Jenny Radford." Oh, Christ. They've picked him up again. Eh? Who? Seely. He's escaped. Has he, now? Well, that's a bit of luck. 'Cause it's not him. It says this man is tall, fair, and... about thirty. Jim? Are you there? You mean we had the wrong man all along? Yeah. So if he has gone and he doesn't blab to the police, you're in the clear. What do you mean, I'm "in the clear"? Listen, man, you're in this as much as I am... Now, you listen to me, Harry... I've got to go now, Jim. Somebody's waiting on the phone. I'll, er... I'll see you when I get back. Harry! Harry! Packet of Gold, Mr Radford. - Thank you. - Thanks. 'Night. 'Night, Mr Radford. Just one more 'alf, Jim, then I'm off. Jim? You all right? How'd you get down here? I mean, why? My glasses. Couldn't see. The river... all those fields. And is that where you've been all the time, right out the back there? Here, you didn't talk to anybody, did you? No. Sorry... I'm sorry. Don't, don't hurt me. No, no, no... 'course not, no. Oh, you... you must be starving. Come on upstairs. I'll get you some food, and, er... ...and some clean clothes. Here. Put these on. Er... ...they probably won't fit, but nobody's going to see you. Well, you have a nice, hot bath... ...and I'll go and get some supper. When you're ready give me a shout. We thought you were the one. I know it was a terrible thing to do... ...but the last two or three days have been like a bloody nightmare. Look, everything... ...just bubbled up inside me... ...and all I could think about was revenge. I mean, you can understand that, can't you? I mean, if it happened to you personally...? No. I... I suppose not. Anyway... I'll do everything I can to make it up to you. I'll do everything I possibly can. In every human possible way. Morning. How'd you sleep, huh? Like a log, I expect. Well, we'll get a few things sorted out today, eh? See if I can get a little money for you. Haven't got much, but, er... ...see the bank manager. See if we can put the overdraft up a bit. Get a few things for your house. Stock up the larder. Well, I have to go and pick up my daughter, Jill, now. So, er... ...if there's anything you need, there are eggs in the fridge, there's, er... ...cereal, bread. Jill? Jill? Oh, sorry. Do you know where she... Is she here? She wasn't in school yesterday. And now... Well, she wasn't at the bus stop. I wondered if she was ill or something. Oh, er... ...I'm, I'm a little short-sighted, my dear, and I've, er... ...I've lost me glasses... Would you... come... come... come... come... come a little closer. Umm, Miss Watts, her teacher, was asking about her. I said I'd find out this morning. Oh. Oh, well... she'll, she'll be down in a moment. Er... hah, I've hurt me face... heh, heh! Sit down, sit down...! Would you like something? Cup... cup of tea? Oh, no, thanks. The bus'll be here soon. I'd better give her a call. Oh... No, no... no... ...no, er... you see, um... ...her mother's still asleep. You'll wake her. Oh. Come, come, come and sit down, she... ...she won't be long. You are a pretty little girl. What's your name? Lucie. - Morning, Morrie. - Morning, Jim. - Morning, Walter. - Morning. Could I have that box of chocolates, please? - Something like this? - No, that big one in the corner. Do you like it? Oh, I'll have to go - I'll be late! No, no, you d... You don't have to go yet, love. BASTARD! Bastard! Don't! Don't! Don't! It WAS you!!! Don't... You...! Emergency. What service, please? Give me the police.
