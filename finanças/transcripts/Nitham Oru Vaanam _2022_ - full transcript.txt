Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. This is your Captain Rupert calling from the flight deck. We will be landing soon in Bhubaneswar. Hope you had a great flight. The weather is a little cloudy and light thunderstorms. Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention, please. Flight number IE 6044 from Bhubaneswar to Kolkata has been canceled due to bad weather. For further information, please contact airline center. Flight number IE 6044 from Bhubaneswar to Kolkata has been canceled due to bad weather. Taxi! Merry Christmas, sir. Sir? Sir! Kolkata. Bus. What time? No bus. The bus will be here at six. Sir, English? Go away. No bus. Didn't I make myself clear enough? Why do you keep calling me over and over again? I need my space. If you call me one more time… I'll switch off my phone. You very well know I'm capable of doing it. Bye. Bye! Bye. Who are you? I'm from Chennai. So? Can you tell me when will the bus to Kolkata be here? Why do you ask me? Am I the only one here? Why didn't you ask him? -I'm not here to see you off. -Hold on a second. I came to you because I heard you speak Tamil. Help me if you wish to. It's not a problem if you can't. I'll manage. Hi. Sorry, I was stressed out about something else. I'm sorry too. I'm not sure if I understood what you asked for. How can I help you? I need to go to Kolkata. I have no idea how to get there, or which bus I should take. I don't understand anyone here. If it was that urgent, you could have left by flight. I came by flight and had my connecting flight from here. But, all the flights got canceled due to the cyclone. I hope there's no problem other than this. I mean… if there is something else, you can tell me. Listen… just let me know when the bus arrives. That would do. I tried making conversation for your sake. In a couple of hours, we'd be going our own ways in different buses. What's the point of all this? That is why I don't even want to ask why you were crying. I tried making conversation because I felt sorry for you. But you're going overboard. Wake up that sleepy-head timekeeper and ask him about the bus. Fine. You're right about the fact that we'd be going our own ways. But, can we at least talk until then? I'm not the kind that can sit quietly and alone. I can't be grumpy like you! That too, till morning. Please. What do you want to talk about? Superb. We could talk about you, of course. Who are you? Where do you come from? What's your name? My name is Arjun. Unlike you… I prefer reading over talking. I don't just read. I imagine myself as the characters of the story I'm reading. The people from the village consider Veerappan to be the local guardian and a hero. Continued to page five. Page five. Where's page five? Mom! Mom! What is it, Arjun? Two pages are missing from the newspaper. Ask your father about it. Dad! -Dad! -Hold on! What is it? What were you doing with Veerappan's biography in the bathroom? Veerappan won't get annoyed if you read it after ten minutes. But I will get annoyed! Arjun, everything is ready. Tony… Dad! What are you looking for? If you told me what you're looking for, I could help you find it. An umbrella. I don't understand. An umbrella! Oh, okay. Put it on the table. Good morning, Arjun. Morning. I've reached. I'll call you back in half an hour. I have an important meeting. Hey, Arjun. Looks like you're early today. You are late. Hi, guys. We are here for a very important meeting. Before that, you have to switch off your mobile. Or please put it on silent mode. Hey, Arjun. Go ahead. Okay, sir. So, today we are going to discuss the commission we share with our agents. And, the agents are categorized according to the districts and zones. The agents throughout our company must be directly respons-- Sir, I thought this was a meeting and it was supposed to be silent. The HR team which has been extremely weak, has to start stepping up the game and-- Dear, I said I'd call you back. If it's an important call… please. Sorry, man. Thank you. The carpenter isn't there? What do you expect me to do? Anyway… the HR team needs to hand-pick every good employee from the competitors. The client categorization… -Hey! -Yeah? Why is he so grumpy all the time? I've been telling you this for a long time now. But, you're the one who's still hitting on him. Nevertheless, he looks good. Everything looks good initially. If you guys get married, you'll not be able to put up with his torture and end up smashing his head with a rock. You see? He's an introvert. Not just you, no girl can put up with him for more than 24 hours. She will dump him without a thought. -Okay… -Excuse me. Within two days, I got ten matches on the matrimony website. My mother matched our horoscopes and selected the most compatible one. Janani. I can say with certainty. The only girl I ever liked in my life, and the only girl who ever liked me was Janani. Sir? Good morning, Arjun. Yeah. For the cuts we used with the clients, because of it… Hey, Janani, I'll call you back in sometime. Look at him. You said he'd never get a girl. Trouble is just brewing. What do you mean? They have just started to talk. Janani… am I good enough for you? -Actually, no. -Oh? Up until a month before I met you… I didn't really want to get married. Why? I thought I'd lose all my freedom if I did. But, when we saw your photo, my mother said something. And then my father, then the horoscope… and then they made me agree to this wedding. Are you okay with it now? Arjun, you are so real. You speak from your heart. You are very likable. How could anyone not like you? But, one thing. I don't think we will ever fight after we're married. Why? Because you never talk! Excuse me, give me a plate of panipuri. -You wanna try? -No, I'm good. I knew it. Don't you like panipuri? It's not hygienic at all. They change the water only once in four days. It doesn't reach even 14% according to the food quality surveys. You could catch a cold, fever, or even an infection. What do I do now? Throw it away. Seriously? Let me have one more. Thank you. -Shall we? -Yeah. -Janani. -Yes? What did your mother say when she saw my photo? I'll tell you this after the wedding. Stars twinkling as diamonds Sing in our midst! Play the drums, rejoice! A grumpy, sullen face Brims with smiles today Let the wedding bells ring! Here, wipe your tears. Hey, I was only looking at him casually. Did you actually believe what I said earlier? Look at him. Does he even look good? No, right? No, he doesn't. I want to hold your hand, my spouse And wish to walk miles and miles with you Steal my heart entirely Play the music, celebrate Hold my hands in yours Speak words of love now Lock your eyes in mine Speak love in my ear Look at how he's smiling! This is the first time he is smiling for a picture, right? Let's frame it and hang it in our living room. But, this is the last time she will be smiling in a photo. What is that look of lust, dear groom? Would he even hold back till it's time? What is that taunting smile, dear bride? Would she defeat me With her beautiful charm? Light my lips with passion Blinding even the brightly lit night Let us be consumed by passion You are mine and I yours Let’s live on -Hi, dude! -Sir. Hi! -That's my boss. -You look like Deepika Padukone. -Thank you. -Yeah. Can I talk to you for a moment? Come with me. Arjun, you only have two more days left. What's your plan for the honeymoon? -Sir… -Just tell me where you want to go. I can get you a great deal for an all-inclusive package through the company. -Sir… -Fine, how about an island? A private cottage surrounded by water. Sir, that's my plan. Oh, yeah? Maldives? Mauritius? Andaman? No, sir. The destination is 13 kilometers from home. There is an exact same resort in ECR. It's just like you described it. The Blue Moon Resort. It is surrounded by water as far as your eyes can see. There is a cottage in the middle of the water… and inside the cottage, there's Janani and me. You're gonna go right here? Yes, sir. If I stay in town I can come back to my house by night… and sleep in my room, on my bed. Staying outside won't work out for me. Fine, let's make a compromise. Let's name it after my mother if it's a girl and after your father, if it's a boy. -That's a big if! -What?! -Some son you've given birth to! -What's he saying? Janani… Janani, I heard you wanted to talk to me? Arjun, his name is Shiva. Initially, we were just friends. We liked each other and later got into a relationship. At first, there was plenty of love and we only fought occasionally. But after a while, we were only fighting. -We broke up just two months ago-- -It's okay. If I wanted to know about your past, I'd have asked you earlier. I know that you wouldn't ask, Arjun. But I wanted to tell you. It started with petty fights. But, one night I was overwhelmed and I broke up with him. He constantly looked for faults in me and controlled my actions. Even when it came to eating, Arjun! I felt like I'd be tied down if I got married to him. I'll be there in five minutes. Do you think they don't have any of the problems you described? Till today, it's my mother who decides what my father's diet will be. Most of my mother's saris are hand-picked by my father. But beyond all this… what's most important is if the other person cares about us or not. Ultimately, if we think about who we are changing ourselves for… there'd be no problems. It's that simple. It's called gamophobia. Every girl has this confusion before her wedding day. What happened next? Hi! Thank you so much, Arjun. What for? If you hadn't talked me over yesterday… I wouldn't have understood anything. I thought about everything you said all night. All my confusion got cleared. He called me yesterday… and we talked it through. I think we are good now. I don't get it. Sorry, Arjun. She said, it's all over and left. But that's when the real problem began. What hurt me more than the wedding being called off… were the people around me talking about it. That was the first failure I faced in 26 years. I didn't know how to handle the situation. I went into depression. -Hello? -Arjun. I heard your wedding got called off. Don't worry about it. -I will find an educated girl-- -Shut up! Sorry, sir. I always made fun of Arjun, saying, he would never get married. I never thought it would happen for real. I feel so guilty. I want to meet Arjun in person and apologize to him. Mom, ask her to get out of here. Hey! Arjun, please hear me out. Get out! Dear… -Arjun, is this how you talk to a guest? -Yes, Mom! Good. It's a good thing your wedding got called off. It's good for the girl, not you. Can't you handle this situation? You're gonna face thousands of situations like this in life. -How will you handle them? -Yes, I can't! That's how you raised me. If you ever dare to bring up my marriage topic again… that would be it! Hey, you! Vasanthi, I've just reached the hospital. Calm down. He is right here. I'll talk to him and call you back. In all these years, I've never seen your mother cry so badly. She came to this hospital when you were eight years old and said… "My son doesn't talk to anyone. What can we do?" But today, she cried saying, "My son talked way too much." I know this isn't something you can forget easily. But, the least you could do is not think about it all the time. It's easy for people to say, "You've known her only two months. Why do you feel so bad about it?" I don't care if it was two years, two months, or even two days. I was true to her, doctor. Forget it. It's only me who can understand my pain. Let it go. Wow! This is the first time you've opened up to me. Listen, Arjun. All of this is just temporary. If not today, you'll have to forget about it someday. Or it will happen eventually with time. Just keep yourself engaged. I live in solitude, doctor. I understand what you mean. But every time I try to do something… Janani comes to my mind. Our conversations, the time we spent, and the wedding getting canceled. My mind is flooded with negative thoughts, doctor. You wouldn't have come to me if they were positive thoughts! Okay. Anything I say now isn't going to make sense to you. What you need right now is not my advice. It's something else. Go somewhere, Arjun. Why don't you meet some new people? Do some soul-searching. Doctor… traveling isn't my thing. Fine, let's talk about this later. Stay here tonight, okay? I'll talk to you. I'll be there in two minutes. Arjun? Doctor, is it really necessary for me to sleep here? It's a new place. I can't fall asleep here. I've asked them to give you an injection. A good night's sleep will reduce all the mental stress inside you. That'll help you make a clear decision, okay? Here. What is this? Arjun, just like you, sometimes I feel stressed too. Every time I feel low, I like to do something I enjoy. I like to write. This is a collection of short stories I wrote when I felt low. You read a lot of books, right? Read it and let me know. I'll see you in the morning. Good night. Good night. Short stories? What was the story? VEERA - MEENAKSHI Usually when I read a story, I imagine myself as the character in it. It was no different that day. Where are you? Hurry up. Lay a finger on me I will strike you like a lightning Try touching the burning flame My wrath will follow you into hell It's the guy wearing a checked shirt in the front row. Who is that right there? Lay a finger on me I will strike you like a lightning Try touching the burning flame My wrath will follow you into hell Please don't… Don't… An elephant tries to kill a snake A screw-pine flower protects the snake Scaring the elephant, my friend! The elephant glares The flower stands its ground An epic unveils itself, quietly! Is this the final act? Is it a never-ending war? Or is it just a passing good luck My friend Don't… Listen to me. Please don't… They would give us a ten-day suspension even though we did nothing. Do you think they'd spare us after what we've done now? They are not going to believe us if we say it was a mistake. Fair enough. But she was so beautiful, right? How come we've never seen her until now? But I saw her. He hit her in the eye. Hey! I swear-- You hit her in the eye. I saw it. Go and mind your business. Fine, I am leaving. You continue brooding over it. Is the food ready? Not yet. Only the gravy is ready. I'm telling you, he is following me everywhere. It isn't what you think. Turn around. -Come, let's go. -Hey! -Hey, you! -Hey! When someone comes after you, don't fear them and run away. Turn around and face them. Look… it was my fault. I hit you by mistake, and that's why I'm here to apologize. Say it before you leave. You were here to say something, right? Sorry. Hey! You made him come all the way to the classroom? He apologized as well! Anyway, all that matters is that you're happy. Congrats. Look after her, okay? Good morning, sister. -What's going on? -The guys are at it already. I don't like the yelling and the teasing. Is it just the yelling and the teasing? I shouldn't have bothered you. I'll talk to him directly. Buddy, over here. -Here! -Hey, Meenakshi's here. Hey! I'm not kidding! She's here. Hey! I need to talk to you for a couple of minutes. Go ahead. Hey! Go on. Don't be scared. Just talk to me. Give us the ball before you go! What's happening around us? I thought you were there to apologize. But you got me into trouble. I wanted to apologize to you in private. You made me come to your classroom. If I knew things would get this far… I'd have just talked to you the other day. But if you'd done that, none of this would have happened. -Over here. -Hey… Sister, ball. I used to be a keen basketball player since my school days. I got into college through sports quota. My father said it was a disgrace to his status to have a daughter playing sports. He made me swear to never touch a ball again and made me join the college. Every time I watch you guys play… I feel like breaking your head with this drafter! I want to tell you something. I'm leaving. Meenakshi… What's the surprise? You never mentioned anything when we spoke over the phone yesterday. Why did you ask me to come here? Give me that drafter. I'll tell you. I know the coach. I've spoken to him. The match is in 20 minutes. You have to play. Give that to me. Give it! Stop playing around. No, I'm asking you to play. How much longer are you going to hesitate to do what your heart desires? Forget about your father, your status, etc. Whatever you want to do in life… whatever you feel like doing… just do it. Even if you don't want to, do it this one time. Please. For my sake. For your sake? It's been a long time. And this is so sudden. Sathya! Go. Here. Get changed. Is that all? Be careful, girl. Hope you know how to play. -Yes. -Hey! Go. Go on. Oh, shit! Do you have to go back soon? What do you want to do? Coffee? Coffee. Throw away your academic books and start playing basketball. My heart feels so light after ages. None of the people around me understood this is want I wanted to do… since the age of 12. How did you get it though? -Can I say something? -Yes. I don't know how to string words together and say them coherently. These eyes, nose, mouth, and face… I want to see them all the time. Just like this. You're really good with words. Oh, no. I don't want to live my life in fear anymore. I want to do whatever my heart desires. I need to go. Don't go. I need to go! Go. Dad! Dad, one moment. Dad! Dad! Dad, please listen to me. Dad, open the door. Dad… Please… Dad, listen to me. Sir, come out. I need to talk to you. Sir, I need to talk to you. Sir! -I'll take care of it. -What's wrong? It's nothing. Tell me! Just that her father didn't call once since last night. Forget about it. What can we do? She is leaving behind her entire life to live with me. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I am so stressed. Imagine how stressed out she must be. Look at her. -Okay, bye. -Bye. -Call me when you reach. -I'll call you. Bye, buddy. -Take care. -See you. Take care. I am your half You, my better half You are my path Me, your raft! You are my destiny Me, your clarity! You are my intoxication Me, your intoxicant! Distant skies and four directions Extend before me as a mirage Lend me a shoulder when I call out We will travel far away! In the realms known and unknown In a story that's complete And yet continuing I have lots to talk with you. We have miles to go. Let's talk on the way. Eat now. In a moment that passed and still remains We stay close touched and untouched! I am your half You, my better half You are my path Me, your raft! You are my intoxication… Okay, buddy. Take care. I am leaving. Buddy, hope there won't be a problem. It's all okay. It's my uncle's house. I spoke to him. -Don't worry about anything. -Okay. -Call me if you need something. -Okay. What are you doing? I'm shaving. I have an interview. If you need to shave your beard to get the job… I don't need you to take up that job. Wash this off. How do we put food on the table then? An unasked question looms Carrying my dreams Looking for you From the corner of my eye! An unsung song Plays on in my ear Sings of your romantic taunts Are you my destination? Am I your right answer? You become my irony! In the realms known and unknown In a story that's complete And yet continuing In a moment that passed and still remains We stay close touched and untouched! You drizzle on my cheeks My eyes close in pleasure All truths fail me They become a farce! The unhealable wound you caused I still seek you My yearning for you grows In leaps and bounds Your fingers look for me My shadow becomes one with yours Lust pours as rain in me In the realms known and unknown In a story that's complete And yet continuing In a moment that passed and still remains We stay close touched and untouched! RAINS TO CONTINUE IN TAMIL NADU We can talk it out. I am on my way. How much do you want? I'm on my way. Okay. Where are you going? I'll be back soon. Come, lock the door. Slowly. Do you have to go when it's raining like this? Hey! I won't cross the speed of 50. You can even drive at 100. But I'll have to be alone here. I'm leaving my queen behind. What about me then? You are my warrior queen. My brave girl. Has everyone left? Son, well… -Withdraw some cash and pay everyone. -Okay. -The pin is 2808. -Okay. Be careful. The rain isn't going to stop any time soon. The water has seeped in. It isn't safe here. There are kids, too. The foreman will be here soon. Take your money and leave. Come back after I call you. Sir, please don't forget to call us. -I will definitely call you. -Okay. One second. Hello? Hello? Hello? I'll be there in 15 minutes. Hello? Hello? Can you hear me? Hello? Meenakshi? Hello? Hey Sister, where is the doctor? She's gone home, sir. Call her. Hello? -Doctor, this is Arjun speaking. -What is it? The last few pages of your book are missing. You wrote it, right? Tell me what happened. What happened to me? I mean, what happened to Veera? Arjun! Calm down. Don't panic. I gave you two diaries. You only read one, right? Read the other one. It has the answers to all your questions. Okay! MATHI - PRABHA WELCOME I'm good. I heard about the wedding only two days ago. That too, only because I ran into you at the jewelry store! We fixed the wedding only two days ago. What's the tearing hurry? Did the girl fall in love? The astrologer told us to get it done as soon as possible. Fair enough. The girl is ready. Where is the groom? The girl is getting ready. The groom's flight just landed. He is on his way here. You still haven't shown me what the groom looks like. I'll show you later. Show her where the wedding feast is. Welcome. -Uncle, where is the girl? -She is upstairs. Go and check on her. String these flowers together and send them upstairs. What sort of ladoo is this? It's so tiny! Sister, how can you be so late? Well, I am here now. -Go up. Mathi is alone. -Okay. Mathi? Mathi… Mathi? Mathi? My name is Mathi. Like every other girl, I really love my father. But, I hate two things about him. One, his shameless laughter. And two… Dear, I've been asking you for four years now. When are you going to get married? I've been telling you for four years too. I only want a love marriage. Or let me at least find my own groom and ask you to arrange our wedding. That's the least you could do. I want to fall in love, Dad. -Saami. -Coming, sir. This isn't going to work out. A marriage is a once-in-a-lifetime affair. It has to be on my terms. Please, Dad. I've just opened a Facebook account. I will somehow find someone. How? In school, you said you liked the boy who sat beside you. I asked you why and you said you liked his haircut. -Isn't that what she said? -Yes. When you were in college, you said you liked the bus conductor. When I asked you why… you said it's because he traveled with swag, standing on the footboard. Your selection has always been wrong. I've made up my mind. Wear a nice saree tomorrow morning… and show up with filter coffee to welcome the guests. I'll take care of the rest. Okay? Fine, ask them to come. Another thing… your filter coffee is really terrible. Your grandmother drinks it because she has no choice. So just make regular coffee. Because we don't want your wedding to get called off because of bad coffee! What say? -Saami! -Sir? Yes, sir? What's taking so long? -She will be ready in another 15 minutes. -Okay. See if the groom's family has arrived and welcome them. Fine, hurry up! Coming all this way just to drape a saree is such a shame, sir. -Sister… -Yes? I look gorgeous, don't I? You look really good. Are you serious? If I were born a man… I'd have snatched you away from here to marry you. Sister, stay still. -Okay, sir. -Saami! Yes, ma'am? What is it, ma'am? What does the groom do? He owns Bhagyavati Rice Mill. It's the biggest rice mill in Kangeyam. Not just that, he also owns a 200-acre farm. A two-storied house on the farm… Fifteen lorries-- What is it, girl? Sister, would you rather I get married to the guy my father wants me to… go to Kangeyam, and work in that rice mill… -Or… -Or what? I mean… Is this the only exit route from here? -There is an exit at the back. -Great. Step aside. Here she comes The brat, the wild one! Here she comes The arrogant, the determined one She is your nightmare She is your worst fear She is an adamant one Don’t mess with her, I say Look at her sitting there. Let's go talk to her. So, you've decided to humiliate your father. Your plan is to just run away? The house was really crowded. So I came here. But all of them have left. Is that so? That's awesome. Did you serve filter coffee to the guests? Or did you at least serve them instant coffee? It's nothing. Nothing. Girl, I don't have the energy to fight you anymore. Please get into the car. -Get in. -See you, Pazhani. Thank you so much. The dispute is resolved. Go home and focus on getting your children educated. -Hey, cut the cluster next to it too. -Okay. Whatever the reason, you shouldn't have gone to the bus stand at that hour. -Think about sir's reputation. -Shut up, Saami. I had to do something like that to shut him up. Or I'll have to make filter coffee for a different guy every week. Dad, since when did you start reading magazines? Flip to page 23. Dad! I look gorgeous, right? It looks good, Dad! Someone really enjoyed clicking my picture! The parlor woman was totally worth the 2500 rupees she charged us! But you were complaining! The day after his reaction, I found out what his next action was. Dad, you look so happy. I'm sure that means bad news for me. Girl, come here. Get down. Come, come, come. Come on. What is it, Dad? One second. -Saami… -Sir? -I've fixed my daughter's wedding. -Okay. It's next Friday. Come with your family. Gladly, sir. I'll be there. Great! -Saami! -Yes, miss? I'm going to run away from home on the same Friday. Sister, all of you should come and see me off. Trying to mess with your own father? Dad, I learned this from you. Who better to mess with, than you? Oh, I see. Let's see who wins. Senniyappan or his daughter? After I decided to run away from home… I tried to have a decent conversation with two people. -Grandma! -Yes, child? Talk some sense into your son. I don't want to get married. Let me just live with you. Why do you say that, child? If you don't want to, I'll get married instead. I should have never come to you! What's the occasion, girl? Why are you buying me a frothy cup of coffee? I have no one except you, Auntie. I knew it. Go ahead. Can you please talk to my father? Your father is always right about things. Just get married as per his wishes. The groom is a handsome, strapping young man, isn't he? I haven't seen him yet! Fine. Let's say I get married. My aunt will go back saying her kids can't skip school. Grandma will go back saying grandpa is sick. You will be gone too. And I'll leave for my husband's house too. My father will be left all alone in that big house. But if I were to marry a boy of my choice… he will live with me, and I will live with my father. Where did you learn to speak so smartly? You sound just like my sister. Please go to my father with that expression and ask him to call off this wedding. Drink your coffee. It's getting cold. Mathi… Mathi? Mathi? I'll rat you out to your father. Auntie, don't do that. I am going to put you in your place today! I'm putting you in your place now! Where are you going? I don't need to tell you anything. My hands are hurting. Untie these knots. I didn't work so hard so that I could untie you immediately! Listen to me! Shut your gob for some time. -Hey, girl-- -I'm leaving. Girl, listen to me! Untie these knots! What is this, miss? You think only your boss is capable of keeping his word. I will keep my word too. I told you, I would be running away from home. I'm doing that now. Do you know how much money the boss spent to organize this wedding? And you say you want to run away! If the wedding doesn't happen… he will lose his honor. Saami, if this wedding doesn't happen, your sir will only lose his honor. But if this wedding happens, I will lose my life! I need to go. Step aside. No. I won't allow you to leave. I will never allow you to embarrass my boss. What did my mother tell you when she was still alive? "Take care of my girl." "Buy her whatever she wants." "You are everything to her." She said. She said that, didn't she? Tell me now… What's more important? Your loyalty towards your boss? Or your affection towards my mother? You've reminded me of your mother. Do you know how many times she's fed me with her own hands? Affection is more important. What do you want me to do now? Tell me, what should I do? Very good, Saami. That's the spirit. I need to run away from home now. You have to help me. You want to leave? Is that all? I'll go ahead. Come right behind me. Let's see who dares to stop us! Come, miss. What an idiot! I'll slaughter anyone who gets in the way! Miss, come. Come on. Go through our farms. -Okay? -Okay. Saami, take good care of my father. I'll take care. Miss, one moment. What is it, Saami? Do you absolutely have to go now? -Wait… -Okay, okay, okay… Go on. Go. Here she comes The brat, the wild one! Here she comes The arrogant, the determined one She is your nightmare She is your worst fear -She is an adamant one -Buzz off! Don’t mess with her, I say Hop on. -Get lost. -Oh, get on. Buzz off. Sir, can you drop me off at the next town? No, move away. Sir, please. Don't create trouble. Step aside! I don't care! I'm talking to you, and you just get in? If you don't leave now… I'll raise an alarm saying you tried to abduct me! Drive now! What? -Nothing. -Keep your eyes on the road. Can you drive a little faster? This is as fast as I go. Fine, how far is this car going? This car will go quite a distance. But in another 15 minutes, I am going to heaven. What? What do you expect? It was a three-year relationship. She said she'd wait for me come what may… and got married before I could get there. You think I can spend the rest of my life thinking about her, growing a beard and raising a dog? Or that I'd get married to someone else? I'm a prideful man! So, you know dung powder? Dung powder? I mixed it with my food and consumed it. You wretched man! You consumed poison? Oh, yes. And I counted on you and got in! How long has it been since you consumed it? It's been a while. I can't say for sure. About six… What happened? Oh, no. Hey, you! Oh God! Move! I have enough problems. I don't need another one! A song is the last thing we need now! I have no idea where the hospital is. It's easy. About 1,5 kilometers from here, there is a bridge. There is a wedding hall next to the bridge. The yellow-colored building next to it is the hospital. There is a nurse called Parvathy. Admit me there. Guys like you attempt to commit suicide due to love failure… only after you get to know about the nearest hospital and its nurses. You rascal! -Doctor. -Yes? -Can I go in and see him? -Sure, go ahead. Why did you save me? You should have left me to die. You'd have died if I left you. That's why I had to save you. You foolishly consumed poison brooding over her. You'd have happily died! I'd have been locked up as the eye witness. And then, I'd have to go back to my father. Wait a moment. Why do I owe you any explanation? -I am leaving. -Wait up! If you'd just left me, I'd have died. Why did you… What did the doctor say? They've cleansed my stomach. They asked me to go home after the two bottles of glucose drips are over. Great! Go home, brood over her, and if you want to die… go ahead and die. Oh, no. My father is here. You don't have the heart to leave me, right? If my father sees us, we'll both be dead! Both of us? Excuse me… if your father comes, you'd be the one dying. Why should I die? The thing is… I was adamant that I wanted a love marriage. But my father was adamant that he'd arrange my marriage. My wedding is tomorrow, and I ran away from home. My father is here now. What would my father think if he sees us both now? What would he think? Yeah, what would he think? He'd think that we made a plan together… and I broke into your home before the wedding… and snatched you away. Exactly! Come on! I'd have peacefully died after consuming dung powder. You brought me here, cleansed my stomach, gave me glucose drips… and now you say your father will butcher me. How is this fair? What a shameless family! How do we escape now? There are three options. Tell me the first option. We can open this window, and jump out. You see that wall over there? On the other side is a trench. -Should I go? -Yes. -Take care. -Yeah. One second. Even if you jump over the wall… one of my father's men will be there. If he sees you and throws his machete at you… you'll lose your right leg. Yeah. Tell me what the second option is, and I'll bless you! No, it won't work. Tell me what the option is! Let me decide if it's going to work or not. Go out… beat up my father and all his men, and take me with you! Why should I beat up your father and his men, and take you away? And you've put on some weight. How will I carry you? Can you tell me about the third option? Out! Both of you! Listen, just nod at everything my father says. He hates people who give him back talk! And I hate nodding. You don't care about your life, right? I didn't care before I met you. What? Nothing. It's nothing. Oh, I see. You are the prince who abducted my daughter? Was your father working with a theatrical troupe? He is calling me a "prince"! That's how he talks. Just nod and say yes. My father hates back talk. He'll just… Yes, sir. If I hadn't come here, you'd have taken her away for good? Yes, sir. You've become bold enough to tie up your aunt and escape? All thanks to his encouragement! Sir, just say the word… I'll tie up his hands and legs and throw him in the canal. Hey, move back. Mom, come here. Go and give it. My name is Ambikavathi. Oh, I see. -My name is Prabha. -Okay. It doesn't matter! Mom, stop chatting there. Come back. Dad, what's all this? What do you expect? If I take you both back to get you two married… how would I know that you won't run away again? My daughter must get married at a wedding arranged by me. Let this happen that way. Tie the thread. Did he just ask me to marry you? Tell me what the third option is, and you will be blessed. This is the third option. We've hardly known each other for an hour. How can I marry you already? When I got into your car, you were listening to an Ilaiyaraja song. You came across as a sensitive and emotional person. And when you decided to die for another girl… I knew you are an innocent man. More importantly, you look like a good boy-- Hey! What's going on? "Marriage is a crop of a thousand years," right? I just need a few moments. You continue. More importantly, you look like a good boy. Very good calculation. What if… I become a bad boy after the wedding? Tell me. I ran away from my father who raised me for 25 years. You are nothing! Such clarity. Tie the nuptial thread on her. Fine, I'll do it! Start calling me son-in-law. Mathi! Dear! Mathi? Hey! Mathi! Doctor? Doctor! Doctor! Doctor! Doctor, why did you do this? Arjun, relax! Doctor, please. I can't handle it. What happened to Veera? What happened to Mathi? Doctor, I can only come up with negative thoughts. I hope they are okay. Doctor, you wrote it, right? Give me the rest of the story. Or at least tell me what happened to them. Arjun, I didn't write those two stories from my imagination. Those were true stories of two people I met in real life. If you want to know what happened to Mathi and Veera… Hold on. Here. Veera and Meenakshi are in Kolkata. Mathi and Prabha are in Himachal. Go and meet them in person. Ask them to fill in the rest of their life stories. Or if you are going to say you don't like to travel… and you aren't concerned about other people's problems… bye! The decision is yours to make. Kind attention to passengers. The next bus to Kolkata… -Hello, they are saying something? -will leave from pillar 22. Kind attention to passengers. The next bus to Kolkata… Arjun. The bus to Kolkata will be here in five minutes. Okay, thank you. Take care. Arjun! People read novels and short stories to kill time. I read them too. When I read them… I can only imagine the characters in them. But you are going to meet the characters you read about in person. They have a form. They have life. I'm so excited! I would like to meet Veera-Meenakshi and Mathi-Prabha too. If you don't mind… can I come with you? I thought you had to go somewhere? Nothing's more important than this. Can I come along? -Sure, but I have a question before that. -Yes? What's your name? Subhadra. Call me Subha. Hey, Arjun. The only reason you are taking me along is because you don't know Hindi, right? Selfish! Get in! Subha. Subha, why have they stopped here? -So that we could refresh ourselves. -In this place? Yes, there is a lot of water here. Jump in. Idiot! Coffee? -Coffee? -No thanks. -He doesn't want. One coffee for me. -Okay. Okay. -Make it strong. -Okay. Arjun, who did you say lives in Kolkata? Mathi and Prabha? Or wait, is it Veera and Meenakshi? I will tell you, but before that… tell me where the restroom is? I help you get on board a bus to Kolkata. I also come along to give you company. And now you want me to help you find the restroom too? The restroom is everywhere as far as the eyes can see. Go. How can I go in public? Want a diaper instead? Yes, doctor? Hello, Arjun? How is it going? It's going good. I will reach Kolkata tomorrow. I've sent you Prabha's contact. The signal might be poor because it's a hill station. So call him in advance before you go there. Okay, doctor. Oh, no. The bus… Subha… Subha, Subha! The bus is gone. The bags are inside. It's right here. I meant the trolley. Your bag, too. But I've got my bag here. What about my trolley? It's gone. What do we do now?! How do we go now? Subha! Come, I'll tell you! Lover, my lover! Whoever you may be, you are mine! Lover, my lover Whoever you may be, you are mine You are the sun that touches my face You are the rain that enriches me Whoever you may be You are mine Whoever you may be You are mine Love, my love! -Whoever you may be, you are mine! -Stop! Lover, my lover! Whoever you may be, you are mine! Thank you. When the rain graces you As the sun is scorching down Thank the clouds A lifelong dream Goes up in smoke! Dream bigger! That’s the way to go This moment is all there is! What good it is to be confused? Live it up Come on, my love! Come on, my love Rain Come, grace me My love You are mine! This is nature’s music, my love Take it all in, my love My love Oh, my love Whoever you may be, you are mine Lover, my lover! Whoever you may be, you are mine! Lover, my lover Whoever you may be, you are mine I've booked a cab. It'll be here in six minutes. Hey! Hey, Subha! Where are you going? Wait! Subha! The cab is just five minutes away. -Excuse me, give me a plate. -Okay. Add more potato. -Spice? -Sure. It's not hygienic. They change the water only once in four days. It's not even 14% according to food quality surveys. You could catch a cold, fever, or even an infection What should I do now? Throw it. Should I? Do whatever you want. The cab will be here in two minutes. -How much? -Twenty rupees, madam. Let's go. Your hands are dirty. Listen? He looks scary. I hope he doesn't take us somewhere else. You are not worth it! Did you understand what he just said? I am Malayali. I understand Tamil. Is that so? Where are you from? Koyilandi, from Kozhikode District. I love the mussels there. Oh, yeah? How long since you came to Kolkata? About ten years now. I got married to a woman here. We have a daughter. Come home. That's terrific! Your Bengali wife knows how to cook Kerala-style mussels? I'll take care of it. Just come home. I'm definitely coming! Looks like you speak Malayalam too! I know all regional languages. Okay! Walking these last ten feet is much more stressful… than the 2000 kilometers I've traveled. Why? When I read the story, I imagined Meenakshi a certain way. But she must be a different person in real life, right? Pass! Come on. Pass the ball. Meenakshi? Arjun? I was told you'd be coming yesterday. My flight got canceled because of the cyclone. -So I got delayed. -Okay. And she is… She is Subha. My friend. -Hi. -Hi. Where's Mr. Veera? One second. Why did you come outside? It's nice out here. Sit. Kolkata is a packed city. It's quiet and peaceful out here. You don't hear anything on this campus except the sound of basketball. So I asked for a house in these quarters. My house… and the ground… I don't go out anywhere else. Ask her. -Go ahead. -Hold on. What is it? Tell me. Ma'am… How is sir doing? Yeah, he is fine. Why? What happened? Ma'am, we know a little about you two. Arjun told me about your college life. It's a great love story! Can I meet him? The Metrological Center has forecasted heavy rains in Tamil Nadu due to a cyclonic depression. Mr. Ramanan, who addressed the media yesterday, said that the cyclonic depression formed near Kanniyakumari-- -Hello? -Hello. -Tell me, dear. -Where are you? I'll be home in 15 minutes. Your 15 minutes are up. -Hello? -Hello? Hello? Can you hear me? Hello? Hello? The number you are trying to call is currently not reachable. The 21-story construction collapsed this evening due to heavy rains. A rescue team is trying to rescue the workers and public caught under the debris. Sources indicate that over ten bodies have been recovered… and that several women and children are stuck inside. Listen to me. No one can go inside. Listen to me. Calm down for a moment. Ma'am, please go to the back. Sir! -Have you seen him? -You can't see anyone now. -The engineer is my husband. -Please listen to me. I've been saying this all day. Ma'am, please wait. Please let us do our job. Go away. Sir! Please listen to me. -Sir! -Let us do our jobs. We've been looking since morning. Please leave now. Excuse me, sir. She is the engineer's wife! The one who was at the site? Fine, get her inside. Ma'am, just you. Go in. Come on in! Oh, God! Dear Lord! What happened? Around 10:00 p.m. or 11:00 p.m., the engineer gave me his ATM Card and asked me to withdraw cash. When I went to withdraw money, I got stuck there due to heavy rains. When I returned after the rains stopped… I saw this all collapsed! Oh God! You will be okay. You will be alright. You are okay. Oh God! It's nothing. It's nothing. Oh God! Call me if you need anything. I thought, even if I had no one else… I'd be fine as long as he is in my life. In one night, I lost everything. When I thought I didn't have a reason to live anymore… You came as my boon You became my everyday You are a part of me! You are the rain that showers on me You held my fingers You held me in your gaze You held my life You are my comfort You are my favorite drizzle You are my favorite drizzle No matter what happens… I decided not to go back to the people I left behind. I felt like her gaze and smile said something to me. I decided the baby shouldn't wake up to the sight of such a negative person. This living being that Veera gave me should be happy. And for that, I have to be happy. SAI INDIAN SPORTS AUTHORITY He always said… do whatever you enjoy in life. Look straight in my eyes Tomorrow is yours to win Seek what you want Even the sky will stoop at your word You are dawn Don’t fear the dark You are a treasure Don’t detest yourself A little swagger is good Make your own path I am by your side Chase big dreams This world is your oyster You came as my boon You became my everyday You are a part of me You are the rain that showers on me You came as my boon You became my everyday You are a part of me You are the rain that showers on me You held my fingers You held me in your gaze You held my life You are my comfort You are my favorite drizzle Last year, a girl called Amudha, from our very own Madurai. She's been selected for the Indian Basketball Team. Do you know about that? She trained on these grounds. An Amudha every year. That's my source of happiness. Veera hasn't gone anywhere. He is right here. In fact, he is around me. Hey, Yatra! Say hi. -Hi! -This is Arjun. -And this is Subha. -Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi! I'll leave now. Why don't you stay here for a couple of days? Some other time. I'll get going. I'll see you. -Bye. -Bye. Arjun! Arjun, stop. Arjun, where are you going? Arjun, I'm talking to you. Arjun! Arjun… Where are you going? I'm going back to Chennai. What do you expect, Subha? It was just two months. A girl entered my life, said our relationship was over… and I got hurt, and hurt the people around me. I've had enough. She was in love with a guy for four years… left her family to marry him… and when she was about to start her life with him, he died. But she is raising a baby by herself… and she feels like she still has a lot to do in life. I haven't done anything! My life is hanging in the balance like someone hit the pause button. I have a lot to do, Subha. I'm leaving. Arjun. Think again. We didn't come here knowing this is going to be our experience here. We came here, and it just happened. We don't know what's going to happen there. Subha, I came here to meet both Veera and Meenakshi. I can't accept the fact that Veera isn't here. -What if Mathi isn't there? -Arjun! Don't be pessimistic. Come for my sake, Arjun. What do you expect, Subha? Veera isn't here. Mathi isn't going to be there. My problem is I don't know how the story ends. But you don't get to decide the ending. I'm going to tell Mr. Prabha I won't be coming. -Arjun, hear me out. -I have to do it. Listen to me, Arjun. Arjun, listen to me. -Arjun, cut the call! -Hey wait, Subha. Subha, let go! Hello? Hello? Hello, this is Arjun speaking. Is Mr. Prabha around? Arjun, hold on a second. I'll pass the phone to him. Hello, Arjun? Hello? Mr. Prabha? I'm on my way, sir. I'll call you after I reach. I'll call you once I'm there. Thank you. Arjun… that was Mathi who spoke to you, right? KULLU MANALI It's safe. Don't worry. You could have done this much earlier! You aren't asleep yet? I'm asleep. Good night. -What happened? -Listen, everyone! The bus broke down. The mechanic will be here in the morning. You can sleep in the bus if you want to. Subha, what do we do now? -Hey, Arjun. -Yeah? When it's pleasant like this… even the memories we want to forget, seem like happy ones. I don't understand. Have you been in a relationship? -What? -Love. Yeah, right. Two years. Those were the best days of my life. I was so happy. It's all gone. What went wrong? No, it's okay. I don't know, Arjun. We were on good terms. Suddenly, he stopped answering my calls. A month later, I saw his display picture on WhatsApp. It was his wedding picture. I stopped calling him. But I want to meet him someday. Grab him by the collar and ask him why he dumped me. -You see this house? -Is this your house? It's his house. I want to go there someday. I want to meet him and question him. I find it so easy to talk to you. But I don't have the guts to talk to him yet. Subha, it's freezing out here. I can't handle this. Hold on. Here you go. Subha! Subha? Subha! Subha! -Hey! -What are you doing here? Arjun, let go of my hand! You could have told me before you left! I spent half an hour looking for you! I woke up and found you missing. Naturally, I panicked. Step aside. Hey. Watch out! What if the car had hit you? You never think. This is why I ask you to be careful. You never tell me before doing anything! The wind carries me to the sky I float in the clouds Freeing myself from spoken words I go looking for the self A cold silence Now unfreezes itself A road not taken Lies ahead of me An unfamiliar thirst Consumes me now I go in search To look for me The cold wind in my ear Sings a new tune Ahead of me Is the path my foot should take The wind carries me to the sky I float in the clouds Freeing myself from spoken words I go looking for the self A cold silence Now unfreezes itself A road not taken Lies ahead of me An unfamiliar thirst Consumes me now I go in search To look for me The cold wind in my ear Sings a new tune Ahead of me Is the path my foot should take -Arjun… -Yeah? -Call them quickly. -Yeah. I only have one bar of signal. Just try! -I am. -Hurry up. Hello? Sir, this is Arjun speaking. Yes. Okay, sir. What happened? -What did he say? -His friend is on the way. -He'll be here any moment. -Okay. You are Arjun, right? -Who is that? -Who are you? Can't you tell from the Tamil? Mr. Prabha sent me. Come on. Okay! -Mr. Prabha has sent him. -Okay. Come on. Watch your step, Arjun. Are you wondering if I know how to drive because I am going slow? Not at all. This is how I drive in this weather. If I go faster on these rocky roads, our asses will take a real beating! Sorry, ma'am. I'm used to talking this way back at home. Enjoy the view. You won't get this view back at home. We've been seeing a lot of snow since yesterday. Oh, I see. In another ten kilometers, we will enter our area. Once we go there, there won't be any rain either. Do you live here, too? I don't live here. I come here for Christmas. I spend ten days with Prabha, get drunk, have a good time… then I pack my bags and head home after New Year's Day. How is he doing? He is just fine. Is he married? Of course. Was it a love marriage or an arranged marriage? Oh, that's a long story! His wife's name is Mathi, right? Yes, how do you know that? Have you already met them? We know a lot about her too. The cold war between her father and her, etc. But we don't know much about Prabha. Mr. Prabha is really innocent, isn't he? You think he is innocent? What was the name you said? You only know him as Prabha. Do you know his full name? Prabhakaran. Deputy Superintendent of Police. Sir, you are not so bad! You've bonded well with me within a short period of time. -Is that so? -Oh, yes. There was an officer posted here before you. He was always so stern. Like what? So stern, like this. Look at that. You've got the same phone as our DGP! How much did it cost you? I can never afford these things. My brother-in-law lives in Dubai. This was part of my dowry! You take bribes there too! Brother, it's got some lock. Yeah, it's not some complicated lock! Just type 1234 to unlock it. Sir, don't click a photo. I'm shy. Come on. Flash a smile. You look good when you smile. True, sir. Everyone says that. I didn't mean it. You are so funny, sir. Temple Bus Stand. Gypsy patrol report. Over. Reporting, Prabhakaran. There's public nuisance at the bus stand. A crowd has gathered because of a girl. Report if you are around. Over. Okay. On the way. -Hey, drive to the bus stand. -Okay, sir. -Gobi Bus Stand? Okay, sir. -Yes. ANNA BUS STAND Here she comes The brat, the wild one Here she comes The arrogant, the determined one She is your nightmare Make way. Why are you sitting here? Imagine what happens if your father finds out. Look at the crowd gathered here. Yes, a crowd has indeed gathered here. Why don't you disperse them? Aren't you paid to do that? I should have never tried to reason with you! Sir, she's got a big mouth. She's always like that. Let me talk to her. -Talk to her and disperse the crowd. -Make way. Drink this tea. Sir? What? It's dawned. Can I go home, sir? You get drunk and create a scene every night… and you are acting all meek now? You want to go home? Sir, he apparently wants to go home. Have a word with him. Come here. Sir? Sir… If you get drunk and step out of your home after 10:00 p.m., -No, sir. -I'll skin you alive. -Go. -Okay, sir. Sir! Look at this. What's this? -You clicked the photo, right? -Yes. But it was on my phone. I sent it to them because they said there was some special prize for the Diwali contest. Who did you say this girl was? I never said anything. Fine, I get it. The girl's name is Mathi. Mathivardhini. Her father's name is Seniyappan. He's leased all the shops in Gobi Market. You want to meet him? If you don't want to, forget I said it. Give me a cup of tea. What are you saying? Yeah? And then? What? Fill up the tank. -Don't try to force me into marriage-- -How much petrol should I fill? -I told Dad clearly. -How much petrol should I fill? -Love marriage only, get it? -Don't use your phone in the bunk. What, one phone call is going to burn your bunk down? Just you talking will burn the bunk down! Sir, lock up this unruly woman! She is such a nuisance. How dare you try to run away? You thought we'd let you escape? You think the police are a joke? -Greetings, sir. -Greetings. -Is the DSP here? -Yes, sir. He is the girl's father. I brought him so that we could talk it out. -Sure, please come. -Yes. Sir, the girl's father is here. Send them off with a warning. Not this girl! The father of the girl whose photo you clicked. What's he doing here? -Okay, I'll call him in. -You fool! Sir, come in. Just you. Okay. -Greetings. -Greetings. Please sit. Sorry to disturb you. No, it's alright. I know the girl. Which girl? The girl you caught with those two boys. -The one in love? -It's not love or any such bullshit. Only jobless people fall in love. They are still in school. All of them are related to me. If you file a case, it will be reported on TV and in thenewspapers. Their lives will be ruined. That won't happen, sir. I've already told them. Okay. You didn't have to come all the way. But the right thing to do was to talk to you in person. Would you like some tea or coffee? You should have asked me much earlier! I'll see you. Another small favor. Someone's published my daughter's photo in this magazine. It's on page 28. I don't know who did it. I couldn't get any details from the publishing house. It was extremely awkward to face our kith and kin. It will be really helpful if you find out who did it. Sir, I wanted to talk to you about that. I just spoke my heart out. If you don't agree, I understand. It's not that. I've heard a lot about you. I just want my daughter to marry and have a happy and peaceful life. Nothing else to think about. So what is it, then? There is another problem. Is it my community? Oh, not at all! I don't give a damn about that. There is a complication. What is it? Son, the thing is… if I go to my daughter and tell her… "I've found a really good groom for you. He is such a nice policeman." Show me your hand. I swear on Goddess Masani, she won't agree to the wedding. Why, sir? -She is your daughter, right? -Absolutely. She is so adamant. Just like me. She says she will only have a love marriage. Or that she will bring some boy, and I have to arrange their marriage. Are you okay with me? Okay. Let's come up with a plan for the wedding? The girl's father, Seniyappan, was the main person involved in the plan. I've fixed my daughter's wedding. It's next Friday. Come with your family. I'm going to run away from home on the same Friday. Where did you learn to speak so smartly? You sound just like my sister. Please go to my father with that expression and ask him to stop this wedding. Mathi! Girl, listen to me. You want to leave? I'll go ahead. Come right behind me. Let's see who dares to stop us! Sir! WELCOME -Sir. -Yeah? Mathi has left. She is going through our farm. Son-in-law, leave immediately. Can I come along to accompany you? -Sure, that would be great! -Okay, then. -Act your age, man! -Son-in-law… I didn't mean you, father-in-law. Mr. Prabhakaran, you've made up your mind to get married at the hospital. Do whatever you want! My outpatient duty starts at 7:00 in the morning. Just make sure to vacate the hospital before that, okay? Tie the nuptial thread on her. Fine, I'll do it! Start calling me son-in-law. Mathi! -Dear! -Dear! Doctor, please tell me my daughter is okay. Sir, anything could happen. I can't say anything with certainty. And, most importantly… make sure nothing disturbs her mind. She can go and live somewhere else. You don't have to mention this to her. Anyway, we will be starting her treatment. This is definitely curable. Moreover… she just needs to feel "I'm okay. I'm alright." After that, she gets to decide her life. I'm trusting you. Hope good things happen. Hey… I had no trouble raising my daughter until now. I have the strength to continue to take care of her. But… I don't think you should suffer by marrying my daughter. -So please find another-- -Father-in-law. Please be calm. Let me talk to her. DSP Sir… are you feeling bad that your plan went awry? How did you find out? I know everything. Looks like someone has decided that you don't need me. No one gets to decide that. It's not too late… just run away. You want to live a happy married life. You don't deserve me, DSP. What if I am adamant that I want a girl who is jovial in every situation? You've made up your mind to ruin your own life. There is nothing I can do about it. If I have to marry you… I have one condition. What is it? If I am the wife or lover of a policeman… they will definitely abduct me in a red Omni van… take me to an abandoned warehouse… and make me call my husband. And I will call you and say, "Dear, please come here." You will panic and rush there, screaming my name out. And finally, they will do something to me in front of your very eyes. Right? You watch too many movies. Does it happen or not? Maybe. Maybe it happens to one in a hundred. Forget about the other ninety-nine. Let's just talk about me. I could get into a problem because of you. So if you feel sorry for me and marry me because you don't have an option… you will carry that guilt all your life. But I will be happy. If you are okay with this deal… I am okay, too. Promise? Okay. Promise. You have another promise to make. Go ahead. You shouldn't spare him. Spare who? The guy in the red Omni van. He should die at your hands, DSP! No matter where he is… I will find him, and I will kill him. If I were in his place… I don't know how badly I'd have cried. But those two didn't let the problems affect them. They started thinking about what to do to be happy. When I see them, I only wish for one thing. That they always stay happy. And they've stayed that way, to this day. Hey, they are Mr. Prabha's guests. -Room number 305. -Okay, sir. I've given him all the details. What about you? Let's meet at the party this evening. Go and get ready! What about Mr. Prabha? There is no party without him! -You drink, right? -Not at all! That's more like it! We belong to the same clan! I'll go and get ready now. Wow! So, Arjun. You never wanted to come to a place like this, even for your honeymoon, right? From now, let's travel like this once every year. We have to come here. Just for old memories. Sure, we can. But your husband and my wife have to agree to it too. If I ever get married. Yeah, if ever… Hey, you hardly talk to anyone. How did you open up to me on our very first meeting? Actually, this isn't our first meeting. It's our second meeting. About 20 days back, I saw this girl at a coffee shop in Chennai. She was yelling at someone over the phone, and crying. I wanted to ask her what was wrong. But that wasn't my character. When I saw her at the bus stand again, she was crying over the phone again. But this time, I wanted to check on her. I went and spoke to her. Don't worry. I won't ask you why even now. I won't cry anymore. Hey! Sorry, got a little late. -It's okay. -Hey… This look really suits you. Your dress is nice too. Not bad! Didn't know you are capable of giving compliments too. Arjun, why have you stopped here? Come in. He doesn't drink. But at least you could have come in with him! -Hello, sir. -Yes, Soosai? This is Arjun. Welcome! My son-in-law told me about you. Hope you are doing okay? Go in. -Take them inside. -Okay. Hey! You don't recognize him? He is Senniappan. Mathi's father. Oh, I see. Come. So, what would you like to eat? Well, Mr. Prabha… He was right here… I'll go get him! Hey, Arjun. -Hi, sir. -What's up? This is Subha. -Hi, Subha. -Hi! Oh, I'm sorry. I was held up with some work, so I couldn't come earlier. That's not a problem, sir. Where's ma'am? I don't feel so good, sir. Just come with me. Sir… Mathi, this is Arjun. Hi, Arjun. How are you doing? How is Meenakshi doing? Did you meet her daughter Yatra? Actually, I had invited them too. But she said she couldn't come because of some tournament. -Hi, ma'am. -Hey! Hi! -You are so beautiful. -Thank you. But how, sir? That's how it is. This is the reality. We have to accept it. I'd say "good night" to her every night, and put her to sleep. But when I wake her up the next morning saying "Good morning, baby…" it's scary. I think it was the 15th day after our wedding… I tried waking her up, but she just wouldn't wake up. A couple of minutes later, she turned and looked at me. Winked at me and smiled. That's my Mathi! She changed my entire life. I know my wife is going to die someday. -Sir, how can you--? -Oh, come on! It's going to happen to everyone someday. Everyone, including you and me. It's just that, it will happen before we die. If Mathi were to die tomorrow… and I start crying… her ghost would haunt me and torment me! Life is very simple, Arjun. They say a human's life span is 120 years. Our grandfathers lived for a hundred years. Hundred became ninety. And then eighty. And then seventy. The current generation, including you and me… we are blessed if we cross fifty. You know the saying, "May you live a hundred years!" We've started saying, "No, thank you!" We know everything around us is fake. But we're just trying to live a good life amidst the fake life. Enjoy life to the fullest, Arjun. If someone across you says 'hi' to you tomorrow… smile back at them and say 'hi'. That's what life is all about. Sir, it's getting late. Hurry up. Coming. Come with me. Arjun. Subha, this is a journey that I'll never forget for life. All my fears and apprehensions are gone. I feel light now. I have a lot to say to you. A lot to talk about. Let's meet soon. Thank you, Subha. Mom… I'll be home in ten minutes. Tell father not to bring up any of the old stuff. Arjun, where are you taking me? Hold on, Subha! -Tell me! -Just two more minutes. Arjun… Keep it brief, alright? Hey! -Hi, Subha. -Who is at the door? I didn't come here to exchange pleasantries. -What? -Why did you dump me? Well, I thought I could-- You don't deserve a Benz! Subha! Run! Don't look back. Subha! Subha! Come here! That had been bugging me for a really long time. Finally, it's done. Arjun… I slapped him really hard! You missed it. Subha… Something has been bugging me for a long time as well. I don't know how to… If you don't mind… Subha… Arjun! Subha! Ready, steady, go! Move! Go! Subha, please stop. Subha! I won't spare you! Subha, stop! Sorry, brother!
