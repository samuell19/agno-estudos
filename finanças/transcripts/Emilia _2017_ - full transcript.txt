A real feat, right? So what do you suggest? Selling out the way you did? OK, fine You don't care about the theater, about us-you don't give a damn But you.. Think about yourself! They could lock you up in the nuthouse! And they definitely won't let you stay in the theater Do you at least understand that? I'm not staying here. So you're betraying us again Let's go, let's go Good, good Emilia, careful. Emilia, do you remember how we used to play theater? So today we're going to play again, OK? Do you remember when we were at the theater? There were a lot of men there And they all talked really loud, right?

May 1972 Kaunas, Lithuania Blame only the regime for my death. Romas Kalanta Mom! Look! You'll get your bath, and coffee, and cocoa - You know, maybe a little bit - A little bit? The guys say I'm the spitting image! I could act! - Would you like to? - No way, what kind of job is that? Raise your arm, lower your ass, raise your leg But this-the collective farm. now that's a job! - Well I'm going to act in the theater - Get out, seriously? - Seriously - I've never been to the theater - Never? - Uh-uh Then I'll invite you, definitely I think for the average Soviet man, the theater But everything there is so exulting, so pure! Yeah, pure- and there I am, with these dirty boots of mine, right? I'll suffocate, oh, I'll suffocate Those black walls crushed me - Oh no, stop, stop, please don't! - Those black walls. The spirit of God does not exist in the world - I can't hear you I can't hear you - I'll suffocate, oh, I'll suffocate Those black.. Stop, stop, stop! So you'll find that theater of yours? Will you find your garage? - Emilia. - Yes? - Will you invite me to a show? - I'll think about it Take care! Freedom for Lithuania! Freedom for Lithuania! - Excuse me, let me through, let me through - Hey, you're going in the wrong direction Come with us. - What? Where? - Come with us, it's more fun. Just look around, everyone wants freedom - I have to go to the theater! - Where? - To the theater! - What are you doing? Stop! OK, let's go To the farmstead, get moving. Let's go! - Hi Leon - Hi. Hold on.. I have one of yesterday's for you - How many did we get yesterday? - Four hundred. And where did they put them? Eight are getting time, and they shaved the other hippies bald and let them go - Here They gave one over to us - Why? They said it's your field, anti-Soviet literature Here, read it - What's his name? - Her name. Some actress. What are you standing there for? Sit down What's your name? Emilia So, an actress I've been appointed. To the theater From the conservatory So you'll have to invite me to a show Sit down! What is this, you've decided to try and scare me? And in general young lady, maybe there's something you want to tell me? Let me go To the theater Please Of course, this is no dormitory, but I understand how hard it is these days to find a place to stay. Wow So. No roaming around the theater at night. No monkey business, no boys, no drinking. What happened to your face? - I fell. - Hm. This one's yours This is for the stage door Thank you Rehearsal is at 10:00 Actors aren't late here Welcome Comrade Ceslovas, this isn't just a table He's seating us here like apostles at the last supper and hoping that we won't understand anything. Or that we'll pretend that we don't understand! So maybe he'll make us sing some religious hymn to finish it off? This is an artistic solution They're fanatics of their idea-apostles! Right, apostles I can smell that nationalistic underground of yours a kilometer away. Kil-AH-meter A kil-AH-meter too! Guys, come on - Ceslovas, all this over some stupid table - Yeah, really This isn't about the table. This is for Lithuania Excuse me. They already brought the bones. Come on, they're here! Let's go What's this now? Hi, it's good you're here I need some with more meat, with meat. Yeah, yeah, that one. Give it to me, give it to me This is mine, mine I got here first - How many did you take? - I was first and I need it Bones? The Meat Combine takes care of us. We give them a better play, and they give us better bones Have you settled in? How is it? - I just expected it to be totally different. - The theater? - It always seemed so.. You know, so.. - Magical. There's nothing magic here - It's a quagmire - The theater? This whole damn system is a theater.. You're neither sobbing nor quarreling We're neither returning nor coming back As long as we have the road, we're moving forward As long as we have our hearing, we're listening to the song We all sang as well as we could We all. I want to welcome the newest addition to our tight-knit family here at the theater - the young artist. Elena? - Emilia. Emilia! Each person who has consecrated his life to the theater is, in truth renouncing himself completely This is how he gives all of himself to the playwrights, the directors, his partners and the audience And I have no doubt that our theater is the perfect cherry orchard, where - Orchard-more like a collective farm - A garden where the talent of a young artist can blossom So, my dear Emilia I'm sure you will manage to feel at home with this group and this stage and that you will one day shine brighter than some of our theater's veterans - I welcome you - Thank you. And now a word from the future living classic future People's Artist of the USSR and the Lithuanian SSR-Emilia! - Poem - Poem, poem. Poetry It is a hymn to the warriors and the unknown soldiers who come to rape our mothers and sisters To the temples of gods whose altars have been exchanged for a fat stomach hundreds of times It is a hymn to papa Caesar, whose lucid mind leads us into the bright distance where we perch, free, behind bars sucking the foul air into our chests as if it were the spirit of freedom and feeding each other lies, and singing the hymn to the god of betrayal who is soiled with the blood of white lambs! Not bad Just.. I didn't have time to do that then Rehearsal tomorrow - is at nine - Eleven, director. Nine. Bravo, bravo, bravo. You know whatever kind of ideas he's trying to carry out, he doesn't have the right to break an actor's back. An over-ambitious director, he stifles both the playwright's idea Director? Yes, director He stifles both the playwright's idea and the actor's talent Director So we actors we have to stick together and resist this directorial despotism And you were great. Way to go. You got up and, how did it go we're feeding each other lies, and singing the hymn to the god of betrayal By the way, who's the author? I'm telling you, they can access your papers, but they never go and look themselves The authorities give the order.. And I bring it to them And your file, believe me.. There's a layer of dust that thick it's been lying there so long Don't get me wrong, but maybe you have paranoia or something? You could take a vacation, relax I'm serious Wait, maybe it's not our guys checking you out, huh? Then I have no idea You have a cornflower in your hand, completely differently than after the war Wonderful times have come Pearls of dew are hanging in the forest From happiness, not a hangover, You would drop into a floweryley And above the native forest border, A small breeze drives a cloud away. All together now Join in. - Not now - Another verse You listen to a song that scares a hare at the far end of the field, and you write perfect lines, that you can shove wherever you want Comrade Ausra, excuse us please So it turns out you really are an actress So, what is it, what? I cannot understand So many horrors surround us and so much senselessness Who gave this to you? WHO? My dad. My dad wrote it And who might dad be? An enemy of the people This is the last time I'm asking nicely No one sent. There is one step between a hero and a traitor. - I'm not a traitor - A simple question A simple. Answer - No one sent me I was sent here from the conservatory - Don't you try my patience! - I. - Quiet! - I don't. - Answer me, now! - I don't know anything. - Simple and clear, or - I don't know anything. - One - No one sent me I swear I don't know anything - Two I need the procedural room Bring Kostas in No one informed me I'm informing you, now. Leon, but after last time I. - Shhh. - Leon A dark night in late autumn. Bearers of freedom settled there Bearers of freedom He's a good poet WAS The poems he wrote for children Only no one knows that in '49 he wrote songs for bandits in the forests Leon! Leon! Leon! They arrested Cornflower, Leon They tortured her! Just look what the fear of death does to a person You can't love the fatherland when you're rotting somewhere in the swamp - Please, don't We promised him a comfy life that every fucking Little Octobrist would recite his poems But he betrayed everything Every last person he knew. He was a faithful dog Just the alcohol. His conscience woke up Look how heroes of the people die Look! Get out of here. Go home, mother No! Come on, pick him up! So, are you going to keep playing the hero, or what? You think I'll see this and shit my pants? You think you're going to scare me? I'm the one who does the scaring here Got it? This is all I have left of my family. I don't have anyone to betray I never have I. I don't have anything. We all have someone to betray Alright, I see it's not funny Hi there What's wrong? Emil. Right Is there anything I can. Do? I... - You sit. - I'll wash them. Come on I. - It's fine, I'll do it myself. - I'm sorry It's my. I'll wash them then. Oh, right OK. - Could you not stare? - Oh, yeah. I can Wrath, vexation, you say And love? Love has come, perhaps for the first time, to those those old blackened halls, where only spite and pain had built a nest before Now love has come. We cried, like children from joy that first day when we were alone together I was looking for you and I found you I have been looking for you from the day I was born I wanted to challenge death But I summoned With all my heart, I summoned life I want to comprehend my incomprehensible fate Wait a minute You wrote this? - My dad wrote it - And dad is...? An enemy of the people Emilia. Kristina! Kristina! Wait. Wait up Kris Kristina I just. Stopped by Kristina. Oh, Lithuania! Lithuania! My love, punish me if there is even a drop of blood among the diamonds Save me if there is love shining for you in the diamonds Be free, oh Lithuania, for ever and ever And be just and good to all! So. What do you think? While no one is talking, I'd like to ask a question, if that's alright Who stole the manure? - What? - The manure. I called the collective farm yesterday and they said that they loaded a truck of manure for us. So where's the truck? Listen, we're talking about the play, about Lithuania Well we're talking about the manure He's right, it's time to fertilize the garden Hey, hey, so when did you sell your actor's soul? And what did you get? That ration coupon for a washing machine? You try washing shit-filled diapers every day with bloody knuckles, I'd like to see that Come on everyone, just look what material we have Hold on, hold on What material? This isn't material-this is. the devil only knows what this is. A woman leading a revolution And against who-the Great Russian nation! So what do you have against women, huh, Julius? Jonas, you're the director Say something already! What, Julius? Against tsarist rule Against class inequality Emilia Plater The first female revolutionary But yeah Obviously. The text is tricky Exactly, exactly That's what I'm talking about. Women! A female revolutionary! Like Maryte Melnikaite. And at the Ministry it'll breeze right through. Oh, I've got to go Watch it now. Before you came, we had everything We went on tour, we performed at the Kremlin They were going to let us take our plays abroad To Poland. What, were the plays any worse? By the way, they have a good theater there. - In Poland? - At the Kremlin You idiot They have a snack bar there where you can get bananas, and peas and mayonnaise. I don't like mayonnaise Learn to make compromises So it works for them and us. Understand? No, Julius, I don't understand I am Severiute from Uzpaliai Village, Where the railway turns to the south, Where along the tracks I walked barefoot, Like a pregnant laundress driven out of the house. Like the last one, at the big table set out There was no room for me Behind my back, without me hearing, you talked, you talked, Behind my back, without me hearing, you talked, you talked, Behind my back, without me hearing, you talked, you talked I was not a sister to you, I just wove the linens I raised my third mute brother by myself I wept in the wooden bed of my dead father And did not blame you. I walked through the frozen earth like through knives, and plodded through the mud of the village I lived far from you, from Uzpaliai Village, miles away, At night of a small white-headed baby, white-headed baby I would talk with the grass The little hunchback who died the year before last played the accordion for me He said he would clothe me in beer and shoe me with a scythe, He said he would clothe me in beer and shoe me with a scythe, He said he would clothe me in beer and shoe me with a scythe. No! No! - Just give it a try. - I'm not wearing these rags These aren't rags These are costumes for the play-get used to them I said no. Kristina, we already discussed what this play is about That this play is about us, about you, about me, about freedom About creative freedom that we don't have. And the freedom to be a person Yeah, well I also don't understand what that madhouse has to do with it? Listen, she's leaving everything Her parents, her home, her privileges. You She's rounding up the men and going to war. You see, she's sacrificing herself for freedom She's giving up her life And you-you take the shirt, well, like a dress. A wedding dress-you see where I'm going with this? And it's as if. It's like the death of freedom Like this? And you know, I thought that maybe maybe you can stick me in a box and make me read my lines from there? There, you got it Do you understand that I am not a thing that you can stick in some box! To read my lines from there! I'm an actress, understand? You can't shove an actor around like a pawn! You're doing everything you can to kill the actor But I want to express my thoughts freely Without all those bells and whistles And without a fuss So if these rags cover up your talent, then maybe there isn't any talent there at all? Go to hell with that talent of yours, got it? I'm not playing this shit So don't! You don't have to I don't think you even could! What are you looking at? Rehearsal is over You can't act like this Don't tell me what I can and can't do! I don't get it, what can't you do here? What's the big deal? How can you go out in front of the audience if you can't even tie a simple knot? Tie it! Come on You tie it, tie it Come on, tie it! - You can't? - Marius, easy - Why? - Calm down What for? You can't! You can't I can Excuse me, but where can I find Antanas? What's this? An invitation to the theater I got a role Emilia, wait Kristina wrote Korsakas a complaint What? Can you imagine, the bitch? She wrote all kinds of stuff That Marius is ruining the actor's talent that his artistic decisions aren't in line with the spirit of the times that he's putting on an anti-Soviet play. How do you know that? I overheard it You know how she screams. - So what's going to happen now? - I don't know But I'm afraid that she's not going to leave it at that So if anything happens, just say so, because we're all behind you. Thanks. Kids, buy some pastries, they're good and fresh, with cabbage or poppy seeds - Do you have any with meat? - With cabbage or poppy seeds - With cabbage - With cabbage And one with poppy seeds - Thank you - Enjoy - And come by tomorrow, we'll have some with meat - OK! Get up Say your lines. Say your lines. - Say them now - What, sir, do you want? It's just a little nothing Let me in your blouse Is that all? I will open my heart to you, and the gates to freedom I don't need freedom if it is given to me by someone else's hand. I don't need freedom if it is given to me by someone else's So what do you see in this scene? Who do you see when you look at me? What's going on in this scene? We discussed this- Kablukov is your fiancé But he's scum You hate him, right? You can't stand him His every touch, his every word, his every gesture He's pallid, fat, blemished. He collapses on you every night with that big, white stomach and smelly armpits. He licks you. Think about a person you despise. One specific person Unleash something Get mad at yourself Someone from your most detestable nightmares When you wake up in the morning and can't wash it off You can't wash it off because he's sticky, slimy, clinging, like, like a leech Like. Like a tick embedded in your skin that you can't brush off he just lurks inside every second like a disease, like pain, like. Cancer Come on! Come on! Squeeze him out of yourself! No! You louse! Give me the other one Poetry! It is a hymn to the warriors and the unknown soldiers Who come to rape our mothers and sisters, leaving only blood and the seed of Satan To the temples of gods Whose altars have been exchanged for a fat stomach hundreds of times It is a hymn to papa Caesar to papa Caesar, whose lucid mind leads us into the bright distance where we perch, free, behind bars sucking the foul air into our chests as if it were the spirit of freedom and feeding each other lies, and singing the hymn to the god of betrayal who is soiled with the blood of white lambs Not bad It's the right direction I want to tell you a story about an actor. There was this actor he wasn't bad, talented - The audience loved him. - I'm not saying anything I'm not asking you anything. That actor got an assignment. Like always-what to do, how to do it But you see, that actor decided to play the hero Suddenly, one day everyone remembered, how those artists, poets, actors. They just keep killing themselves. And themselves There's going to be a play Based on this Who told you to? It's going to be about the struggle of the working people against tsarist oppression. You still don't understand who you're dealing with? Here, you see this? Now we have it, and suddenly, it's gone Emilia's gone. - What, didn't your mom tell you? - I don't have a mom And I don't have a dad. I don't even remember what they look like. I don't have anything Anything at all You're afraid of me YOU'RE afraid of me Of a little girl who you can't take anything away from because people like YOU have already taken everything. But you are such a whore - Kristina, if. - Bitches in heat like you come here in throngs You think you just spread your legs and what? A star. Now Marius is screwing you, and then someone else will, and then someone else So go ahead and be that star. For now Then someone younger will come along and they'll throw you out into the street. That's the kind of career we have here, kid. And when you give Marius.. Just don't puke, OK? What, hey, wait! What is this?! To the right. Left. Coffee, cake You said you live alone This is Brunhilda! Brunhilda, this is Emilia Please be acquainted She's my dad's He brought her home when they closed the university. He said she's his second love - What does you mom think about that? - Mom was already dead My father planted these apple trees I was just a little kid I learned how to prune them. It's actually about time I did Everything is overgrown How overgrown everything is But after the harvest Marius, aren't you afraid? Of what? At the theater they're saying that we really went overboard this time - that they might ban the play - When have they ever said anything else? When we have a drink after the play, it's all "Marius, here at the theater we're like a family, we're like a fist that can strike a blow against the system" But when the time comes to do something, no one's there And then Korsakas is like, "Marius, you have to learn to make compromises" I can't I can't I don't know how When they came for my father, they gave us a few minutes to say goodbye. He kneeled down next to me and said, "Son, now everyone's going to tell you that I'm a criminal, an enemy of the people Everyone will lie They'll lie shamelessly, to the entire world And the entire world will believe it But not you" And then they took him away I never learned to live with a full stomach I never learned. And you never will That's enough lying around Get up! Now you're going to prove it to me What, are you scared? Darius! Darius! Darius. Help! Those actors they just keep killing themselves So what are you doing? What are you doing? - What am I doing? - I'm asking you What are you doing, Leon? We don't work like that We haven't worked like that in a long time. It's not 1951. Do you understand what I'm saying to you? You asked if they're digging stuff up on you, and well, my dear, they are And they're digging deep I don't know what you're up to, and to tell you the truth, I don't want to know If you're drowning, then drown on your own. Got it? On your own You shouldn't have strung that kid up And you know what the most important thing is in all this? To stay alive To survive They always let us in to watch the dress rehearsal Madam, you misunderstood Go look for those madams of yours in America - Ma'am, can students get in? - No! The authorities said no So what kind of authorities are they? Afraid of the voice of the people? Madam, we're not afraid of authorities like that. Not afraid. When you freeze your rear end off in Siberia, then you'll be afraid They're not afraid. They're not letting people in the theater They're afraid that people will find out what they're banning Did you see? - Did you see who came to the rehearsal? - Who? I guarantee it -they're going to ban our play. Julius, what are you worried about? You're a communist-nothing will happen to you. You can always say that I threatened you, that you had no choice And a drunken soldier brought a girl to the stable where his friends were making merry and gave her vodka all night, until sunrise The earth filled with terrible guilt Moonflowers, stinging nettle and creeping thistles sprouted up in an ugly place And the girl lay there, no longer calling on God for help And the people didn't see her for three days and three nights First you will destroy love, because that is the connection that is hardest to break And after renouncing your friends and family loving no one and detesting everything - So, are you ready? - My stomach is full of butterflies Butterflies? Butterflies are good Cockroaches would be bad, but butterflies are good Emilia, you're on You will go to look for a place for your grave, the beginning of true life Emilia Emilia Emilia I have come to greet you, as your betrothed I know you have not yet made a vow to me but you are already able to accept my gifts. From overseas? And what is wrong with your own village, which is not adorned by foreign beauty Where plain rue nestles to the ground, and intoxicates our hearts oh, so sweetly Can a gift take the place of a beating heart? I will drink water from my own well" So. The director has shown all of his visions Indeed, we have a remarkably artistic picture of the struggle of the people against tsarism Go ahead, comrades Please Well I would like to say that I liked the play. But I did not like the performance at all Yes, but we all have to admit that this is a working version Maybe I could see a few small mistakes too But you have to agree that Well, we can always revise it. We can always adjust something, solve the nuances, problems. And what am I supposed to make of the excessive use of blood in the play? Especially when the blood is not being portrayed as that of a sacrifice It is the symbol not of blood that was shed in the fight for something but of senseless cruelty Crime And for some reason, this crime is directly identified with the red flag of communism Comrade Korsakas, I want to ask you, In the name of what is this play being staged, huh? We have to educate the people according to the concept of internationalism, correct? And what is this? This is. This is blatant nationalism Comrade Simkus, you're exaggerating Exaggerating! Yes, you would have to be completely blind and deaf to not understand what the play is about. In my opinion that is, in our opinion this is clearly the unenviable work of a young, ideologically immature artist who is still completely undeveloped in terms of creativity One who has obviously succumbed to the influence of anti-Soviets and various dissidents So what's the point of this whole carnival? You condemned everything In advance Those artists are sensitive. Let's forgive him for losing his temper like that. I can change a few scenes I can. I can revise some nuances That's exactly what I'm saying, Marius! See, I can feel that we're about to reach a compromise. That compromise, it's haunting me. Compromise, Communist, Komsomol. Are they going to ban the play? - Komsorg, Kom.. - Marius, yes, yes. We'll make a compromise. We? We We! We already strangled this whole thing We! We killed this entire business We killed the truth We made ourselves some stupid hunting trophy out of it and call it the truth. When in fact, we're living every day, every second, in some sort of lie. He's going to get burned, honest to God. - Compromise! - He's going to get burned Compromise! This entire society has rotted because of this whole compromise We're soaking in this swamp, and what's keeping it going? No, not the belief in a bright tomorrow, not going to church. No, not the army or security forces No! It's every decent Lithuanian's fear of losing his cracked trough! And what has all this made us? Traitors We betrayed Lithuania They laid their heads to rest in the forest, and we betrayed them You and I Take that off Take that off, you'll freeze. Love has come perhaps for the first time to those old blackened halls. Don't go. Marius, please don't go Marius, I'm begging you They didn't give me a choice - This is my fault. - No, it's not I want to tell you You know what they said to me? They look me right in the eyes and say Don't you feel a sense of despair, meaninglessness? Don't you think about suicide sometimes? After all, you artists, you're always They threaten you They're cowards - they're more afraid than we are What's going to happen now? I'm not going to fell the Taiga To Siberia There's a theater there. To exile Don't be dramatic-people have come back from there too. A handful. I'll come back I promise. Hurry up, we're about to go. You wanted to run away without saying goodbye This is like a business trip What are you lying to me for? - Passenger, are you coming? - Yes Just a moment. Take care of Emilia Which one? Both, take care of them both What the.? Read it out loud, so everyone can hear. Soviet Lithuania is going through a period of acute class struggle Our theater is harboring activities of bourgeois and nationalist elements directed against the consolidation of the Soviet system in our local culture" So it's because of you, you bastard, that they banned the play - You denounced Marius! - I didn't denounce anyone For the love of God! You're a communist, you don't believe in God Where should I put this? What is it? What do you mean what? It's blood for your play Marius said that paint won't do What? Fucking blood for your fucking play There's not going to be any play, they banned the play! You know what, go shit yourself, OK? Now you won't even be able to take a shit in peace. You'll be scared that someone's watching you. So who's the traitor? Hm? Maybe it's you, my dear? Not you? No, not you This is like a game, let's look for the traitor. So, maybe it's you? - No, not you. - Stop messing around What's wrong? - So maybe you're the traitor, huh? - Go to you know where I am Why? I had to. Wait, Emilia, please, say it isn't so I'm begging you, say that it wasn't you It was me, Andrius, I wrote it I'm begging you, say that it wasn't you Just lie, dammit! Emilia, come on! It was me After the war, the French used to shave fascist whores bald. Miss, miss, miss! They brought her in unconscious But now she's come to By the way, we found this scrap of paper in her coat pocket. It had a telephone number on it so I. Please, come in. Heroism, you say. What kind? To rot in the forest? Or to survive? To stay alive Build houses, write books Bring up children. That's enough lying around Get up! You Know how long being a partisan lasts? Six months. Six fucking months! I'd already spent three months in the bunker Three And I wrote during all three months Like a madman And I only had three months left to live. Three months Now you're going to prove it to me. What, Are you scared? I'm here about the play. Oh, right But there won't be any play There's no director And no lead actress We don't have them. They fired the theater director! - And the authorities banned the play - I'm the authorities to you! I'm not deaf I'm just saying that there isn't going to be any. Now listen carefully This is a state order, got it? Yes, yes Of course. Excuse me, but perhaps you have a spare ticket? I can't I'm counting to three One But I did everything, everything! - Two - I betrayed everyone I betrayed everyone, you hear me? What else do you want from me? And now you're an enemy of the people - I can't. I'm not like that - Do it! I can't Please. Good boy. Leon Good boy There's no horror left, no fear.? Come in. Come in, comrade, come in We replaced the blood with water. And of course we got rid of all those double meanings Right, but what about that nationalism? No. The word "Lithuania" was removed everywhere And a drunken soldier brought a girl to the stable where his friends were making merry and they gave her vodka all night, until sunrise and then they unveiled her chastity as the sun came up, one by one The earth filled with terrible guilt. Moonflowers, stinging nettle and creeping thistles sprouted up in an ugly place And the girl lay there no longer calling on God for help and the people didn't see her for three days and three nights And you will isolate yourself from your friends and family and then loving no one and detesting everything, you will leave your village or town to look for a place for your grave the beginning of true life What is she doing? Emilia What's going to happen now? EMILIA! I have come to greet you, as your betrothed. From overseas? And what is wrong with your own village, which is not adorned by foreign beauty? I didn't want to die Can you understand? I didn't want to die I betrayed them all I betrayed them, I killed them with these very hands! So how does it feel when you understand that you've been clinging to the words of your father's killer your entire life? When you've read every single line a thousand times? When you were really just soaking your hands in your father's blood. How does it feel? Huh? Huh? Leon! Get over here! And there is no martyr or prophet And nothing is concealed that will not become known What you are doing in the dark will be visible in the light What you whisper in private will be proclaimed from the roofs And you will come back. You will come back permanently. Thoughts and all my being, at the source, where Your passion and pride have begun for your near suffering. Ceslovas! What are you doing? We have to, Jonas. Just look- people are hanging on every word So what? Who's better off because of it? Huh? Lithuania - Lithuania will be better off - There is no Lithuania. They shot it, deported it, drowned it in drainage canals Jonas, I'm begging you, let's be amicable I'll answer for it myself Get out of my. Poetry! It is a hymn to the warriors and the unknown soldiers who come to rape our mothers and sisters leaving only blood and the seed of Satan It is a hymn to papa Caesar, whose lucid mind leads us into the bright distance where we perch, free, behind bars, sucking the foul air into our chests as if it were the spirit of freedom, and feeding each other lies and singing the hymn to the god of betrayal who is soiled with the blood of white lambs The hymn to the god of betrayal who is soiled with the blood of white lambs No one will understand it Too many intricacies They'll understand The women in the audience will break into tears and the men will act like they don't care, but they'll cry anyway Lithuania will be free. And then you will realize that the dagger which you raised above the head of you brother has infected your blood That the poison that you put in their food has paralyzed your liver And you will rage like rabid animals until you fall to the ground when you see the terrible mistake and the Earth will not take you in You cannot protect yourselves, leaders, by hiding behind borders and guards When you lose vital contact with your brothers you will lose flexibility in your joints your cooling blood will stop feeding your brain and you will start to rot like a fish or a state-from the head down Everyone! Look! The crown It shines, dazzles, intoxicates I despised the crown and hungered for it as salvation I will look again to make sure it is not bloody It seems not. And what is within it? Justice? God? There is no God, nor is there justice So what, then? Rubies, gold? Or the power of control? I wanted to challenge death But I summoned With all my heart, I summoned life. Be free, oh Lithuania, for ever and ever And be just and good to all. Bravo! Bravo! Emilia, Emilia I'm sorry, I had no choice. I love the theater too much Young lady, where are we off to? - To Novosibirsk. - Oh! Not Sochi? No. I need to go to Novosibirsk So that means Moscow You'll go to Moscow and switch trains there. Oh, love. When everything is frozen through the iron frost There are always those who come alone They scratch their hands through the ice until they feel the pain They punch a hole, so that the others could bathe Everything is burned, they walk through the ashes There are always those who come alone Hands have burned in the fire a thousand times Until a well is dug, so that others may drink from it Are you the One? The one with the injured hands Are you the One? The one with the injured hands Pain will flow as honey, there where we are reborn to seek hope Blood will flow as honey, there while we are alive, again will seek new hope Translation: Kristin Baird Subtitling: Ovidijus Zalys
