(birds chirping) (man grunting) (woman screaming) (loud thud against flesh) (wind blowing) (fabric tearing) (ominous music) (leaves rustling) (leaves rustling) (dramatic music) (liquid dripping) (ominous orchestral music) (somber organ music) (wind blowing) - Eight of 'em, Dr. Hayes. Eight of 'em in the last two years. Nice girls, every one of 'em. (boat chugging) Everyone hangin' there like a cut hog, with that hex wrote on her chest. - But surely the authorities should send someone down here to-- - Oh, they do, they do. I'm gettin' rich just runnin' 'em around the swamp in my boat here. They allow it's a prevert. - You do mean pervert, don't you? - Prevert, pervert, it's all the same 'cause they ain't caught him. Course some folks say we got a witch in the swamp again. - [Dr. Hayes] Again? - The old-timers say we used to have 'em all the time. Sorta went out of style when they started drainin' the swamp. Yes sir, some towns is famous for their rhubarb. We was famous for our witches. You say you was a Boy Scout? - Uh, movie scout. We're looking for a movie location, scenery and such. - Tasha. - Hmm? - Why is Dr. Hayes pulling the old boy's leg? You know, the movie scout bit? - Well, because if you start telling people that you're doing psychic research they think you're some kind of a nut. Are you going to put me in your article? - I'd rather put you on the magazine cover. Sell a million copies. (boat chugging) (birds chirping and cawing) (woman giggling) You a student of Dr. Hayes? - I'm afraid not. Owen and Sharon are. Maggie's his secretary and I'm the sensitive. - What on earth is a sensitive? (boat chugging) - [Dr. Hayes] What makes the old-timers think these killings might be the work of a witch? - Dr. Hayes, a real witch is darn nearly immortal. I ain't talkin' about on of them old conjure women that sells love potions for a buck. They ain't no more a witch than that little girl there. But a real honest to God, 'scuse me, Lord, witch can live for hundreds of years, provided she gets her blood regular like. - [Dr. Hayes] Blood? - I don't know what she does with it exactly, but she has to have it or die. And there wasn't a drop of blood left in any of them girls. It was all drained out, careful like, and carried away. (metal crunching against wood) (passengers chattering) Well, there she is. Ain't never rented her out to movie folks before. Mostly hunters and such. Say, you wouldn't mind if I collected an advance, would ya? - An advance? Oh no, of course not. How much is it? - Well now, me and my boy brung your food and gear up here yesterday, and you and your party today, and when we come and get ya that's, uh... - Three trips. - Right. And then six people in the cabin for five days... I'll have to ask about $21. - Well, you drive a hard bargain, Mr. Leblanc. - Well, business is business, Dr. Hayes. There's a week's fuel supply for the power plant if'n you don't run it night and day. Plenty of water in the cistern. Don't drink out of the swamp. It's full of fever. - We'll be careful. - Less'n a feller has a boat and a guide, there's no other way outta here except'n through the swamp, and that's about 10 miles of gators, moccasins, and quicksand. Don't rightfully know that anybody's ever made it. - Well, I'm sure we'll be all right 'til Friday. - Sure you don't want me to check in on ya during the week? No charge. - No, if we need anything I'll phone you. You do have a phone? - Sure, I got a phone, but you ain't! (boat chugging) (ominous music) (upbeat music) (everyone chattering) (loud static on the radio) (upbeat music) - Well, I wonder if we can apply for government aid. (women laugh) Would you mind turning that thing off? - Oh, sure. - Well, we're all free until this evening. Oh, just a minute. Maggie? - Yes? - Where are we sleeping? - Well, you can take this room because it's bigger and it'll double as your office and Vick, you and Owen can take the bunk room in there. Oh no, I have two beds and three girls. - Why don't you and Sharon take the bedroom. I'll bunk on the couch out here. - I don't think that'd be fair. - Oh please, I love fireplaces. - Are you sure? (Tasha laughs) Really? It's your spine, eh? - You got a minute? - Oh, certainly. Step into my palatial office. - Well, you're all set Dr. Hayes. Sorry I couldn't find a red apple for ya. - Well, now that we're comfortable, what's on your mind? - If I get out of line you'll tell me, right? - [Dr. Hayes] Uh-huh. - When the magazine first pitched me on this article they called it an investigation of psychic phenomena. They forgot to mention murder. - Well-- - Now hear me out. I'd just like to know how you justify bringing these women out here into the boondocks for some nut seems to be knockin' 'em off every few minutes. And right now the score is eight-love in favor of the nut. - Well, if you're going to investigate something, Vick, you have to go to wherever that something is, right? Well, when we planned this trip there hadn't been any killings for six, seven months. And there's no provable connection-- - That still doesn't answer my question. - Now hold it! I didn't come blundering out here with no thought of the danger or the welfare of my group. Here's a complete report from the state police. Go ahead, read it. In every instance the victim was isolated, alone. There are six of us. - It's still a calculated risk. - [Dr. Hayes] Which we are willing to accept. - That's laying it right on the line. Next question. - Fire away. - [Victor] What's a sensitive? - Oh, you've been talking to Tasha? Well, I don't blame ya. If I were a few years younger I guess I'd be talkin' to her myself. What's a sensitive? You ever take any physics in school? - Couple years. - Well, you remember when electricity flows through a wire there's always a magnetic field around it. - Well, that much I remember. - Any occult or psychic activity also generates a field around it. The only trouble is (sound skips) can't use instruments to locate or measure it. You have to use a person who is sensitive to it. - And, therefore, is called a sensitive. - [Dr. Hayes] Right you are. - And that's Tasha? - [Dr. Hayes] That's Tasha. - So she's spook oriented, huh? But why out here in this swampy nowhere? - This is exactly what we want. Well, in the first place, we have a high incidence of occult activity. - In the second place it's out of the high rent district. - Well, yes, that's true, too. The third place is a little more complicated. You see, any electrical activity, radio station, high wires... Well, even the wires in the walls of a room. It can set up so much interference that a sensitive can't do her best work. - Well, that shouldn't be a problem here. - Well, there's a radio station in Casper goes off the air at nine o'clock. The power plant in town is so small I doubt if you could even measure its field. Yes sir... I think this is just about perfect. Speaking of perfection, I seem to recall I have a bottle of excellent scotch in my luggage. Do I interest you, Mr. Gordon? - You fascinate me, Dr. Hayes. (birds chirping and cawing) - You know, he's a funny kid. - Who? Owen? - Mm-Hm. You know, I went out with him a few times at school. - Put some on me, too, okay? - Okay. - [Tasha] What happened? - Nothin', darn it. I ordered a martini and he drank carrot juice. (Tasha groans in disgust) - He says that martinis are bad for his sweat glands or something. (women chuckle) - I'm afraid my sweat glands will just have to fight it out for themselves. - Mine, too. There. - Thanks. - You're done. (women groan) (ominous music) - [Sharon] Tash? - [Tasha] Hm? - [Sharon] How did you get to be a sensitive? - (chuckles) My mother was one. (sound skips) and Herb's lawn. Grandma put the whammy on him and he had laryngitis for one month. (Sharon laughs) - [Sharon] You're wonderful. - Where are you going? - I think I shall go throw myself at Owen again. (Tasha laughs) (birds cawing) (ominous music) (man chuckles) (man spits loudly) (ominous music) (Tasha groans) (ominous music) (dramatic music) (man laughs maniacally) (ominous music) (Tasha sobs) (leaves rustling) (door latches clicking) (man groans loudly) (loud thuds) (wood grating) (man laughs) (footsteps on stone echoing) (water dripping) - [Man] Hail Satan. I have nothing which is not thine. (water dripping) (stone scraping) Satan, give me my purpose. (torches pop) (metal clanging loudly) (ominous music) Jessie of Coventry, I command you to appear. (wind whooshing) I call you in the name of him we adore! (suspenseful music) Jessie. Jessie! (flames exploding) (metal clanging) (thunder booming) - I have come a great way. - You come in good time. - And you are? - Luther the Berserk, Sabbat Master of this parish. - We celebrate the Great Sabat of Candle Mass here in three days, yet I am commanded here tonight. So I ask myself, what is so important it can't wait for three days, eh? - There is a woman. (Jessie laughs loudly) (Luther laughs) - And it generally is. (laughs) All right, now that I've had my little joke, suppose you tell me about her. - She's a woman of great beauty. There are only 12 of us now. I want to bring her into the coven. - Into the coven? Does she hear the voice? - Her grandmother was a witch. - [Jessie] Does she hear the voice? - She hears, but she doesn't understand. Today I cast the spell of the stones. Three times she responded. - And now you want old Jessie to rake your chestnuts out of the fire, huh? - Jessie, as Sabat Master I can do many things. I could call underlings from great distances. I can have them whipped to death for disobeying me. Or I can reward them richly. All of these things I can do and many more. But Jessie... there are some rituals best performed by two. This is very important to me. I want no mistakes. I am told you are a past master. - Flattery hasn't turned my head in 200 years. (laughs) But I like it. Luther, let's talk together like two merchants. The girl has not come forward of her own free will. Now this thing you want. It can be done. It is very difficult, I know, but it can be done. - Jessie, I knew that-- - Let me finish. Now if, mind you I said if I can control her, the master gets her soul. You get her body. And what does old Jessie get, huh? - (laughs) What you want most, Jessie. Youth, beauty, a new life. - It's a difficult ritual, a blood ritual. And only a Sabat Master... (ominous music) The blood of a maiden drawn by steel (gasps)... on a night when the moon is full. - Tonight, Jessie. Tonight. - You have to take the sun down here (sound skips) by degrees. You coulda had a sunstroke. - I feel fine. Really. Just dizzy and emotional. - [Victor] Vitamins? - My beddy-bye drink. - Or just a high-powered tranquilizer. Makes her pretty groggy but it sure tunes up her receiver. Hm, you better go sit down before you fall down. - So, if she gets a signal what happens then? - Well, we get a compass fix on it and track it down. Actually talk to the people. We brought some motion picture equipment, sound gear-- - [Owen] Dr. Hayes? - Yes? - [Owen] Casper just went off the air, no signal at all. - Oh, well, try and see if you pick up any signal from the power plant. - Yeah, well, ya have to kill the house current. - Oh, Sharon, light the candles. Vick would you mind? The light switch is on the front porch just to the right of the door. - Sure thing. - Thank you. (wind blowing) (crickets chirping) (door clicks shut) - I get .13 on the power house. - [Dr. Hayes] What's your fix? - 97 degrees... 13 minutes. - Figure that vector then we'll correct Tasha's fix. Shouldn't be more than two degrees, three at the most. - [Victor] What do we do now? All join hands? - You can all keep quiet if you expect any work out of me. - Well, we all ready? Nice and drowsy? All right. Let's all be quiet now. (crickets chirping) (ominous music) (Jessie chanting and singing) (ominous music) (Jessie chanting and singing) (ominous music) (Tasha screams) - What happened? What's the matter? - Leave me alone, ya old fool. All of you, leave me alone! (Tasha sobbing) - [Tasha] Oh, I'm so ashamed. (crying) I don't know what's the matter with me. - Easy, easy, easy. - [Sharon] (mumbles), that's all. - Listen, all this can wait 'til tomorrow morning. I want this one put to bed now. Get rid of that stuff, will ya Owen? I'm gonna have to take some notes, Maggie. I'll see you later. What did you see out there when you turned that light off? - Well, I didn't see anything. I thought I heard some footsteps. How'd you know? - Don't ever take up poker for a living. You haven't got the face for it. - [Luther] Did it go well? - You saw. It was simple, for me. - Can you control her? - I controlled her tonight. (exhales loudly) If I speak to her again, I will control her until she dies. Or until I die. Or until she takes her vows as a witch. - Good, good. Before the dawn breaks, you'll be a maid again, this I swear. Now remember. Tasha has to get that girl away from the house and into the swamp. I want her alone. Again, now. (loud thud) (glass clanking) (Tasha groaning) (Jessie chanting) (ominous music) (Jessie chanting) (crickets chirping) (metal clanking) (ominous music) - Tasha, what's going on? - Shh. (Dr. Hayes chattering) (ominous music) - [Sharon] Tash? (ominous music) Tash! (Sharon screaming) (Luther grunting) (loud thud against flesh) (Jessie chanting) (book slamming shut) - And the rest of the stuff we're just gonna have to wait until later, by golly. (groaning) Enough is enough. My goodness, it's almost two o'clock. - That's not that late. - Maggie, you shoulda said something. - Well, I don't mind. - No, you should've... - No, really. - You're gonna think I'm a slave driver. - I said I don't mind. - I'll tell ya what, you sleep in tomorrow morning. - I don't wanna sleep in. Look, if I get to bed now and if I get up at eight I'll get plenty of... Sharon's not in her room. - [Dr. Hayes] Good. She's not? - Dr. Hayes, that girl is not in my bedroom, she's not in the office, and she certainly isn't out here. - [Dr. Hayes] You mean... - I mean... - Well, why don't you look. - (exasperated sigh) Why don't you look? - Why don't we both look? (door rattles) - I feel like such a fool. - Don't. Now that we know she isn't in with him we've really got a problem. - Do you think maybe she went out for some air? - At two o'clock in the morning? - No, I think I better get the boys up. (ominous music) (metal clanking) - It's still warm. Hurry now. (water dripping) - Hail Satan. I have nothing that is not thine. (Jessie breathing raggedly) - [Jessie] Satan, give me my purpose. - And she was still putting up her hair when I left her. I don't know what time it was. You two were still up, I heard you talking. - Ah, well, that must've been about 10:30 or even earlier. - And then I came out here and fooled around for a few minutes and then went right to sleep. - That's great. She could've left any time within the last four hours. Well, we're not going to find her standing around here. Owen, leave the lights on so she can find the house. Maggie, some coffee might taste good when we get back. - I'll take care of it. - Let's go. (door slams shut) (torch pops) - The next few moments will hold exquisite agony for me. If I... Cry out, do not falter. If you do, I die. - Prince of Darkness... hear me. Satan, behold thy supplicant. Satan, honor thy covenant! (flames popping) Satan, show thy mercy to-- - Sharon! (leaves rustling) Sharon, is that you? - No, it's me, Vick. You see anything. - Found this. You recognize it? - It's a sweater. Oh, you mean is it Sharon's? Gee, I wouldn't know. I get 40, 50 kids in a class. Just become one big blur. Wouldn't know what they were wearing. - You know, we could be going at this whole thing the wrong way. - Yeah, what do you mean? - I tripped over that sweater before I saw it. We could've passed within six feet of her a dozen times tonight without knowing it. Yeah, and this darn thing just went out on me. - Let's head straight on down towards the water, wait for the sun to come up. Should be about, oh, 20, 30 minutes. - [Victor] Doc? - Yeah, I'm comin'. - Remember the eight girls old Leblanc talked about? Make that nine. (ominous music) (voice chanting) (Jessie yelling) (ominous music) (leaves rustling) (ominous music) - Remember, Vick, when I... When I said that a class of kids was just one big blur? It isn't exactly true. Some of 'em stand out. Some of them... stand out, Vick. (sultry orchestral music) - It's been 50 years since a man looked at me like that. Fifty years. - [Owen] Should we say a prayer or something? - No, Owen. This is only temporary. They'll wanna have some kind of a service back home. I wouldn't even bury her, but four more days. - [Owen] Did you find anything? - Snakes, deer, wild pig... more snakes. Well, this part where we are is a few hundred acres of high ground, with quicksand and marshes on one side, and the swamp on the other three sides. It might as well be an island. - Any trails or a boat? - No boat, but I followed a few animal trails. They either petered out or dead end. - We could build a raft. - With a shovel? Our only tool. I hate to be a crepe hanger, but I'm afraid we're stuck here 'til Friday. - Doc? Can you continue your work without Sharon? - Well, I guess I could-- - Well, let's get it rolling, then. We sit around here staring at each other until Friday, Leblanc will have to take us out of here in straight jackets. - He's right, Dr. Hayes. Moping around won't bring Sharon back. - Of course he's right, Owen. Course he's right. Maggie! - No sense bugging Doc with this, but I'd feel a lot safer if we kept a guard posted at night. Will ya take the first shift? - Sure. - And I'll relieve ya about 12. Look, if either of the girls leave the house, one of us goes along, right? - Right. - Before ya go, Vick. Well, this is kinda hard to put into words, but... Last night before you went looking for Sharon, Tash said that she went straight to bed and didn't get up at all. - And? - Well, from where I was lookin', I could see mud all over her slippers and her ankles and after you left, she went into the kitchen and washed everything off and she acted kinda funny about the whole thing. (birds chirping and cawing) - (crying) We were so close. Almost like sisters. - If crying helps you, you go ahead and cry. - (crying) I keep seeing her, hanging from that awful tree. (ominous music) - Who said anything about a tree? - Over and over, all night long. The same awful dream. (crying) - Look, Doc's gonna need your help. Now what good is a beautiful sensitive with red eyes and a runny nose, hm? You've been working with Tasha for quite some time, haven't you? - Two, three years, why? - What do you know about her? I mean her background, personality quirks, or emotional problems. - Her IQ is quite high. She's very emotional, inclined to be moody, and very susceptible to suggestion. - How susceptible? - Oh, extremely. I can hypnotize her in nothing flat. 'Course that's what makes her a sensitive. Excuse me. - I hope you're not gonna tell me she's a witch. - Oh, you mean because of Granny and poor Mr. Baker? No, you don't just inherit the title, you have to work for it. - Are you saying you believe in witchcraft? - I'm saying I believe in witches. Now, well, the craft is something I'm going to know more about after I complete this study. - But I always thought that-- - You always thought that witches were little gray-haired old ladies that were framed by their neighbors, forced to confess through torture and burned at the stake in a age of abysmal ignorance and superstition. - That about sums it up, except for the part about Halloween and brooms. - I don't think you realize how widespread this thing was. Or is. Over a million people were executed for witchcraft prior to 1700. - Impossible. - Not over a period of three centuries. Hitler killed over six million in three years. We have signed confessions to most-- - Obtained through torture. - Not all of them. Not all of them. Now, some of them were freely given in hopes of getting back in the good graces of the church. We know they did cast spells, they did enter into contracts with the devil. We have signed photostat copies here, dates, places, everything, the whole works! And we know they did attend big meetings, or Sabbats, where they danced and drank and raised hell most of the night. - Of course they flew to these Sabbats on their brooms. - They thought they did. Now, we have the formula for the flying ointment they rubbed over their bodies prior to a Sabbat. Oh, it had enough hallucinogenic and psychedelic drugs in it to make anyone think they were flying. - Maybe that was the original trip. - Could be. No, the existence of witches isn't open to question. Either in the Middle Ages or even today, for that matter. - I find it hard to believe that people still go in for witchcraft. - Believe me, they do. (crickets chirping) (metal lever squeaks) - Well, how do you feel? - Just right. - Good. Now, let's all be quiet and give her a chance to work. (ominous music) 85... 96... 87... 88... 92... Is that all, Tasha? - Yes. The feeling isn't very strong tonight. - Well, now we're getting someplace. That was a beautiful fix. Can I get you some coffee or something? - No thanks. I think I'll go to bed. I'm very drowsy. Maggie, may I change in your room? - Oh sure, honey. - Thank you. Goodnight, goodnight, Vick. Goodnight, Owen. - 'Night. - Goodnight. - I better put the lights back on. - Oh, I think I'll go with ya, get some fresh air. (metal lever clicks) (crickets chirping) - Well, at least you have the action pinpointed now. - I only wish that were true. - All ya have to do is average those headings. - And I get the location of the local power plant. Which I already know. - You've lost me. - Every heading that Tasha gave us last night was in the general area of due west, somewhere around 270 degrees. Now tonight, she gives us 90-odd degrees, very close to due east. You tell me what's wrong. - So she made a mistake. - 180 degrees is a pretty big mistake. - What are you trying to say? - I'm just saying don't be so defensive. - But you're practically accusing Tasha-- - And you're practically shouting. I'm not accusing Tasha of anything. I am saying that the results we're getting just don't add up, and they don't add up by 180 degrees. - I'm sorry I shot off my mouth. - Well, forget it. I already have. - Would you buy this? I'm defensive about Tasha... because I... I think she's somehow involved in this mess. - That I would buy. (crickets chirping) - The fools have actually posted a guard. With his little popgun. (chuckles) (ominous music) - [Owen] (chuckles) I thought everybody was asleep. - Everyone is asleep, but I got lonely. Mmm, say, is that coffee? - Yeah, you want some? - [Tasha] Mm-hm. - [Owen] Okay. (Tasha exhales loudly) (Tasha groans) (Tasha giggles) - [Tasha] Ooh! - [Owen] Oh, are you cold? Here, take my blanket. - Oh no, just keep it on. I'll share it with you. Oh, that's better. Sure this isn't bad for your sweat glands? - Oh no, not if you drink it black. I drink it black. - [Tasha] This is the first time we've been alone together, isn't it? - [Owen] Yeah, I think it is, but I've thought about it. - [Tasha] Why, Owen. - Oh, I don't mean it that way, Tash. - Shh. Darling, there's nothing wrong with that way. (Tasha moans) Owen, please, not out here. - Oh, I'm sorry, Tash, I didn't-- - I'm not sorry. (moans) I want you to make love to me, but not here. Let's get away from the house a little bit, shall we? - Well, I (stutters)... - Just a little bit. Come on. - I'm on guard duty, not too far. - [Tasha] Just far enough. (owl hoots) (ominous music) - [Tasha] Owen. Owen. Here I am, Owen. (owl hoots) (ominous music) (loud clanging) (knife stabs into flesh) (Owen groans) (somber music) - Okay, sergeant, hit the sack. (crickets chirping) Owen? (owl hoots) Quitting time. (crickets chirping) (rifle clicking) (crickets chirping) (ominous music) - And you swear in fear of eternal agony that you will reveal to no one what we do here? - I swear. - Dost thou come of thine own free will? - I come of my own free will. - Do what I desire and what I do. Thou art my God. - Thou art my God. - And I am thy slave. - And I am thy slave. - By his mark shall the master know his own. (Tasha gasps) (female voice chanting) I place myself at every point. - I place myself at every point. - In thy power and in thy hands. - In thy power and in thy hands. - Recognizing no other God. - Recognizing no other God. - For thou art my God. - For thou art my God. (Tasha crying) (knife scraping wood) (loud clanging) (metal dragging on the ground) - You know, I remember the first time that I ever had to do something really unpleasant, something that I knew was going to hurt someone else. It was the first student I'd ever flunked. It was the daughter of a friend of mine and I put it off for two weeks. Finally go to the place where I couldn't tell her. Tasha, where were you last night? - I was in bed. - All night, Tasha? - Yes, all night. - [Vick] What did you wear to bed? - What I usually wear, my pajamas. - You had on your red nightgown when you said goodnight. - And you were wearing a red gown when you came in this morning, I saw you. - You're lying! I told you I was in bed all night. - Owen had a piece of your red gown in his hand when we found him. - If you know something, for God's sakes, tell us! - Leave me alone. (Tasha screams) (loud zapping) Vick! (sobbing) I'm sorry, I didn't mean it. - Listen to me, listen. Honey, you've gotta understand, we are in real danger. All of us are in real danger now unless you can help us. - Darling, I don't want you to get hurt. I want to help you, but there's nothing I can do! - Can't you understand, this is no time for-- - Anything you want out of me you have to force out of me. Can't you understand? I can't help you! (Vick grumbling) - Wait a minute, Vick. Wait, wait a minute! I think we've pushed her far enough. She just needs some rest. (Tasha crying) I think we should give her one of our powders and let her relax. Uh, um... - Why did you stop me? You know damn well she knows more about this-- - Of course she knows. She told us that. She also told us, or tried to tell us, that she can't talk about it. - I don't know what ya mean. - Well, I don't know what I mean exactly either, except that I do know this. If she's got some information locked in her subconscious I know how to get it out. - Hypnosis? - Exactly. - She'd never stand still for it. - When those tranquilizers start to work in about 20 minutes she won't have any choice. - 20 minutes. In 20 minutes it'll be dark. I might as well tell Owen to... I'll go get some fire wood. - [Dr. Hayes] Poor Owen. All his life he went with the... Weights and the wheat germ. Treated his body like a fine watch. Now, he's just as dead as if he'd been a bum or a wino. There's a moral there someplace. I wish you'd tell me what it is. - I'm no philosopher. I'm the guy that gets the fire wood. (door slams) (wind howling) - [Dr. Hayes] Was Owen dead when you left him? - I think so. He wasn't moving. (thunder rumbles) - After you made the profession, did you sign anything? Anything at all? - No. It was not my time to sign the pact. (wind howling) (Luther groans angrily) (thunder booms) - When will you make the pact? - Candle mass. Sabbat. - That's tomorrow night. And it's a blood ritual. Will you use Sharon's blood? - Not Sharon's. Maggie's. Maggie's blood. (thunder booms) - Were you marked? Did they mark you? - My... My back. - Well, now we know what we're up against. And his name is Luther. (Maggie screams) (thunder booms) - [Luther] You called Luther! (thunder booms) (metal clanking) (Victor groans) (Luther laughs) (fist thudding on flesh) (men groaning and yelling) (Maggie screams) (Maggie screams) (wind howling) (dramatic music) (water lapping the shore) - Well, that's done. Again. - Yeah. - You know the dirt from that grave was flung all over the place almost like an explosion. - That figures. Did she see you bury Owen? - Stretched out in the sun over there. Does it matter? - Remember that she was hypnotized last night and I don't suppose she remembers a thing. And I wanna keep it that way. Well, for now at least. - You sound like you've been doing more thinking. - Most of the night. - You know any more than you did? - Yeah. Of course a lot of it's still conjecture. (exhales loudly) Is there any coffee up at the house? - [Victor] Yeah. - If I'm right... If. There are things going on in this swamp that haven't' been heard of in centuries. I think our friend Luther is a berserk. - A berserk. Since when has berserk been a noun? - Well, not for hundreds of years. They were hunted down and killed off. The berserks use blood for their ceremonies, fresh human blood. And the only way to get it was to kill somebody, so they were hunted down like rattlesnakes. - Is there any chance Luther is a phony? - Did that experience with Owen's body look like amateur night to you? - Well, I'm sure there's a logical explanation for that. - Let's hear it. - I just don't wanna believe in witchcraft. It goes against everything I've ever trained my mind to believe. Why can't we... Why can't we go shoot Luther through the head just for openers? - Still leaves Jessie. And Jessie is a still in control of Tasha. - So we shoot Jessie, too. - Now there's a good idea. Where is she? - How would I know where... - Now we're getting down to it. Aside from giving up the two girls, what alternatives do we have? - Since we can't run... I guess we have two alternatives. Either we can stand pat here or we got out and try to whip Luther. - Right. Now if we hole up here, and try to protect Tasha and Maggie, I mean, he gets them and kills us in the bargain. Last night's experience showed us we can't stand up to him. Second possibility, is that we go after him. Now, that's the last thing that he'll be prepared for. That's the last thing he'll think that we'll do. - So we'd have that advantage on our side. - Right, exactly. Maggie? - Yes? - You were raised on a farm. You know what wild garlic looks like? - Sure. - Well, you go out in the kitchen and get a paper bag and you collect all you can find. I want you to put it in my office, but don't let Tasha see you. - [Maggie] All right. Right now? - Right now, scoot. Now, until this thing is ironed out we'll have to realize that Tasha's on their side. I'll keep her busy for the rest of the day with some kind of trumped up work. - I understand. What do you want me to do? - Get Owen's rifle, you're going hunting. - For Luther? - Wild pig. (crickets chirping) So, this afternoon I gave her a bunch of phony tests to keep her busy. On the last one I slipped her the powder. She still sleeping? - Mm-hm, like a baby. (exhales loudly) Well, is that what you wanted? - Well, you are now invisible to a witch at least. - You've never actually tried this garlic bit, Doc. You know anyone who has? - No, but I can show you a dozen references that maintain that garlic makes a mortal invisible to a witch. - Well, damn it, Doc, I just don't feel invisible. - Well, you better hope it works. It's our best shot. - You better hope it works, too. I've got the rifle. All you've got's a can full of blood. - Whose? - [Dr. Hayes] Not whose, what's? The blood was from a pig that Vick shot this afternoon. - The poor little thing. - Well, it's his blood or yours. Look, are you sure you don't mind being used for live bait? - Sure, I mind. What's the alternative? - Maggie, you're all right. - Oh, and you smell like a dropout from a pizza parlor. - Listen, no matter what kind of a story Tasha hands ya, you go along with her. I mean, let her lead you out of the house but don't make her suspicious. - Let her get you into the swamp and then when Luther tries to jump you, we'll jump him and your part of it is over. - Yeah, I'm sure. If you miss, my part's still over, right. What a setup. - Like she said before, what's the alternative? (crickets chirping) - (chuckles) Button your sweater, Ralph. (crickets chirping) (ominous music) - Hail Satan. I have nothing which is not thine. Satan... give me my purpose! (dramatic music) My brothers and sisters, I command you to appear. Warlock of San Blas. (dramatic music) Fong Quai. (dramatic music) Goody Hale. (dramatic music) The hag of Devon. (dramatic music) Felicity Johnson. (dramatic music) Le Singe. (dramatic music) El-ah Hishmach. (dramatic music) Amos Coffin. (dramatic music) Nautch of Tangier. (dramatic music) Marta of Amsterdam. (dramatic music) - [Marta] We have come a great way. - (laughs) you've come in good time. (everyone laughs and shouts) (upbeat Middle Eastern music) (crickets chirping) - [Dr. Hayes] If he knows Maggie's coming from the house... Hey, how about here. Was this where we found Sharon's sweater? - [Victor] Yeah. So, if we're gonna get behind him, let's try back that way. We can see the clearing from there, too. (crickets chirping) (upbeat music) (everyone laughing and chattering) (spits loudly) (Warlock of San Blas groans) (Felicity laughs) (dinner guests chattering and shouting) (Middle Eastern music with castanets) - Silence. I will speak of discipline. Marta of Amsterdam, you stand accused of gossip about this coven, Marta. How plead you? - Guilty. - For the first offense, the lash. For the second, strangulation. (Luther yells) (whip snaps against flesh) (Marta screams) (whip snaps against flash) (Marta screams) (Luther yells) (whip snaps against flesh) (Marta whimpers and cries) Since the beginning of time the master has seen fit to have 13 of the faithful in every coven, yet we number but 12. As Sabbat Master of this coven, I have professed a novice. Her name is Tasha. Tonight she makes her pact. - Takes blood to make a pact, Luther. - (laughs) There will be blood when it is time for blood. And Tasha will be here in her time. Jessie! (sultry music) Jessie, call Tasha. (suspenseful music) (leaves rustling) (suspenseful music) (Luther groans) (Maggie screams) (loud thud) (loud thud) (Jessie chanting) - [Dr. Hayes] Where'd you learn that gun bit? - In the service. I was wondered if it would work. - [Dr. Hayes] You never tried it before? - No, I was the company clerk. At least we know the garlic works. - Oh no we don't. He was flat on his back before he had a chance to see you. Ouch. - [Dr. Hayes] Well, we'll just have to chance it. - Darn it. - [Dr. Hayes] What's the matter? - Long fingernails. - You both stay here until I get back and if that joker moves a muscle, shoot him. - [Dr. Hayes] You hold that blood bag until the last minute. If they get suspicious-- - I know, I know, just sit tight. (crickets chirping) - I'm sorry about your, uh... - Try chest. - I was going to say thorax. - Oh God, the academic mind. (ominous music) (Jessie chanting) (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) (lively music) (party goers chattering) - [Felicity] Watch who you're shovin'. (loud smack against flesh) (cat yowling) - That little scut. (cat meowing angrily) (Luther grunting) - [Maggie] Everything okay? - [Dr. Hayes] Hasn't moved a muscle. Vick really clobbered him. (lively music) (party goers chattering) (party goers laughing) (lively music) (party goers chattering and laughing) - I wonder what'll happen when they use the pig blood. - Well, it should be like putting salt in the sugar bowl. If they drink it, it just might kill 'em. (dramatic music) If they just sorta rub it on, who knows. If I only knew what ritual they were using-- - He moved! - Oh, I don't-- - I saw him, he moved. (ominous music) - Just take it easy. I'll go check him. (Maggie screams) (Luther yells) (Maggie screams) (men grunting) (Luther groans) - [Maggie] (screams) No, no, no! (screams) Oh no! (Middle Eastern music) (party goers chattering and laughing) (metal jangling) (Middle Eastern music with castanets) (Felicity laughing) (Luther coughs) - It will be dawn soon. - I can see the candle without your help. - You have the blood. - I... - You have the blood! Give it to Jessie. - Where did you get that? - It's the blood. - Did Luther send it? - Luther? - [Jessie] The blood is here! Tasha will make her pact! (coven members shout) (everyone cheers and laughs) (leaves rustling) (ominous music) (Luther groans) I place myself at every point. - [Coven] I place myself at every point. - [Jessie] In thy power and in thy hands. - [Coven] In thy power and in thy hands. - [Jessie] Recognizing no other God. - [Coven] Recognizing no other God. - For thou art my God. - [Coven] For thou art my God. - If you love him, then drink what he has provided. (suspenseful music) (deep voice chanting) Do you accept the master for all eternity? - I accept the master. For all eternity. - Then make your pact as we bear witness. (ominous music with chanting) (metal clanking) - [Man Shouting] The blood! The blood! It's poison. (Warlock of San Blas shouting) (coven members screaming) - Luther! (coven members screaming) Luther! What did you put in that bucket? - Jessie, wait! (Jessie grunting) It's all over, Jessie. It was pig blood. (Jessie grunting) (Jessie screams) - [Tasha] (screams) Jessie! (dramatic music) (Tasha screams) I have nothing which is not thine! (loud explosion) (Tasha screaming) (deep voice moaning) (Luther grunting) (ominous drumming) Vick? Oh, Vick. (Luther shouts) (metal clanging) (ominous music) (Luther screams) (Luther grunting) - He'll kill us, Vick! - If I could just get him to... Come on! (Luther grunting) (suspenseful music) (electronic zapping) (loud explosion) (suspenseful music) - [Vick] This way. (Tasha gasps) (ominous music) (electronic zapping) (loud explosion) (suspenseful music) (Luther laughs) (loud explosion) (Luther laughing) (loud explosion) - [Vick] Quicksand. (Tasha screams) No, hold it. We're gonna have it out with him right here. (Luther yells) (Tasha gasps) (ominous music) - No one has ever defiled my Sabbat and lived. - Look, somehow garlic destroys a witch's power. - But how? - I don't know how, but I do know that he can't see me right now. I'm gonna get this around his neck. - I offered you eternal life. And you profaned my sanctuary. - You're the bait. Stay there. Trust me. - You preferred certain death to Luther. (ominous music) Now you shall have both. (Luther grunts) (Tasha screams) (dramatic music) - Help! Vick! (thudding against flesh) Help, help! Vick! (thudding against flesh) Vick, help me! (dramatic music) (everyone grunting) (Luther groaning) (water sloshing) (dramatic music) Die! (man's voice laughing) (dramatic bells ringing) - [Several Voices Chanting] Hail Satan, Hail Satan. I have nothing which is not thine! Satan, Satan, give me my purpose, Satan. Satan! (dramatic music)
