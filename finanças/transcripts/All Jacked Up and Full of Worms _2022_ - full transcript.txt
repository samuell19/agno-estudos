(dramatic music) (intense music) (dramatic music) (intense music) (tense music) (smooth music) (audience applauding) While most four year olds are playing with toys, Angelo Inglesian was casting pagan spells, doing drugs, and having sex with adult women. His father was a practicing pagan, mixing elixirs and collecting herbs from the Albanian countryside. At five, he was excited to study paganism under the pagan Pope of Olympus. By the time he was 11, he was dealing drugs, pimping out his cousins and even deeper into paganism. At 15, he had a major drug overdose. He died and went to hell. (Samantha inhaling) Babe, I don't wanna do your hippie shit today. Shh. Just listen. Okay. Underneath your skin. Uh-huh. Below and between each fold in your brain, there is your stupid machinery. Picture this. Organs vibrating. (Benny panting) (upbeat music) Stork man. A voice crawled into my brain like a parasite whispering, "You've been doing drugs, Angelo," "but you never reached the opalescent epiphany." "You've never been super high." [Samantha] These organs have no past, no future, no preconceived notions. [Delivery Man] Sign this thing. Yeah. I'm uh, I'm gonna be a dad. [Delivery Man] Oh, congratulations, that's great. Yeah, my baby's in that box. Oh. Hope it's all right. I didn't drop it or nothing. (laughs) No man, man. It's all good. It came out of the floor and grabbed me and I knew immediately I had to get home to my mother. And then before I know it, it got real dark. It is dark in there inside the depths of your body. (Samantha laughs) Let the light shine in. ♪ Ah ♪ Benny Boom. All right, man. All right, you have fun. Yeah, yeah, thank you. Yo, so I didn't used to fuck with queers, you feel me? Then I realized that dudes- - Yeah, all right. Are down for anything. Like they'll fuck anything. All right bud, I'll see ya. I got a dick so I'm gonna fuck with it, man. All right, I'll see ya. So I got into my car, started driving. I remember the orange glow of the street lamps, started to double, triple. I knew that if I focused on the glow, I could find home. ♪ Um ♪ Roscoe? (Roscoe crying) Roscoe? (Angelo grunting) (Roscoe moaning) [Angelo] This was real. You can't even describe the fear. Hello? The things started to come out from underneath the car. They grabbed me by my mouth and pried me open. [Kelsey] And what did they look like? They were worms. (TV static buzzing) (whimsical music) (Roscoe crying) Hey. [Samantha] Roscoe? (Roscoe panting) (Samantha laughing) Wow. I, I think I just killed my own childhood. Damn dude. That sucks. - Wow. - Oh my God. That is amazing. You went so deep. Yeah, I guess that's kinda cool. I did good, I did good. Yes, you did so good. I'm so happy for you. Wow. Wow, wow, wow. That was amazing. I feel, I feel, good. Babe, I think that's enough hippy stuff for today, okay. Really? I'm spent. [Jared] Close the windows, it's fucking cold. No. No, we're gonna leave it open. Look. No, it's freezing. [Jared] There we go. I just, I feel like, I feel like we are in here so much, you know? I, I, I wish, I wish things were more open. [Jared] Are you okay? How are you feeling? Oh, I, I feel hungry. I feel energized, but with nowhere to go. (Samantha breathing deeply) Welcome home. You're like my test kid, 'cause I uh, there are a lot of, there, there are a lot of reasons why I can't have a real kid right now. I got a lot of problems. I'm uh, I'm horny. I'm on pills. And then there are the hospitalizations, mentally, um, wards. A lot of time spent in wards. Mm. Hungy? Hmm? Woo. Can you say, "Daddy?" Can you say, "Dadda?" Sorry, I don't have a mama yet. I have to find one for you. But I'm gonna raise you to be a man. (Benny spits) Hm? Can you spit? (Benny Boom snorting) (Benny Boom spits) Yeah. We're gonna get you spitting in no time. (train whistle blowing) (tense music) (people moaning) Oh God, it's even better. (couple laughing) Hey, what the fuck? Come on, Clown King. Come on and fuck me. No, no. You know what, dude, you know? You know what? Your mouth is just a big hole that needs cutting up. You know what I mean? - Let's go. No one gives a fuck what you think.

I'm sorry. [Henrietta] It's no big deal. It's, uh- Happens all the time. It's 'cause I have to- You're into stuff like this. Are you scared? Yes. Take it. I won't hurt you. Unless you want me to. Please don't. Okay. Yeah, I'm, I'm sorry. I don't like this. Okay. (chaotic music) (neighbors arguing) Well, you got 15 minutes. You can do whatever you want. I want a kid. A, a baby. Yeah? Well, sounds like you should get pregnant. (laughs) Oh God. You can be the mom of my baby if you want. (Henrietta laughs) Come here. Come on. Okay, Daddy, how about you tell me about the first girl you ever kissed. Her name was Maggie. [Henrietta] And what was she like? She smelled like hamburgers and she had dried tomato sauce on her face. She cornered me behind the house and made me kiss her, and I remember thinking, "Don't kiss the tomato sauce," "Don't kiss the tomato sauce," and I was so fixated on the tomato sauce that I landed right on it. And after that I started humping pillows during nap time. Do you still hump pillows? No. That's kid stuff. Then what do you hump now? I don't know. [Henrietta] I have another idea. (sirens blaring) (worms squirming) Isn't it cool? Yeah. Do you wanna eat one? We could do it "Lady and the Tramp" style. Uh, nah man. I'm, I'm good. [Henrietta] Why not? It'll make you feel good. It's a living thing. You should buy these worms from me. I'll sell 'em to you cheap. Just try them. You'll like 'em. Thank you. (door opening) (smooth music) Why didn't you take the worms, Benny? Why didn't you take the fucking worms? You know what? Fuck it. Hey, I just wanted to say that I had a really great time and I would totally do worms with you for- Hey. Did you leave this behind 'cause I found it. Uh. [Benny] Uh, yeah, thanks. Was there a girl in here? Nope. Just me. You okay, man? Yeah, I'm sorry. I'll, I'll go. I, I just need a place. A place, uh, for what? Place in the dirt. That sounds dark. Sometimes I feel bad. So, it's okay to feel that way sometimes. Oh no, uh, nah man. I, I meant like a place for these worms. (worms squirming) Careful. Sorry. Let me see. Whoa. Yeah, man. I'm just trying to like preserve life. You know? I understand. Worms are life. Worms are love. Yeah. I didn't used to fuck with queers. You feel me? What do you mean? But then I realized I got a dick, and dudes will fuck anything. You can love anything. Fuck any damn thing, like, I got a dick, so I'm gonna fuck with it. The girl I was with said you can take these like drugs, and um, she wanted me to take one with her like "Lady and the Tramp," but I said "No way." No way. Yeah. It was pretty hot, dude. Anyway, man. I got a kid at home I gotta take care of, so. I feel you, man. [Benny] Yeah. I'll take care of these for you. Oh, okay, yeah. [Angelo] Worms spawning worms. Some of them were hairy, some of them were slimy, and they were all different sizes. There were itty bitty ones in my mouth wrapped around my tongue. Some of the worms were in makeup and bras and panties. They kept saying, "Come make love to us." They were all laughing. Laughing at you? Yeah, and they said, "We tricked you." "You were doing spells," "and this is a setup to take you to hell." They were tormenting me. God damn it. [Angelo] Reminded me of my past. Everything I ever did in my whole life on this earth was down there. Hey, who told you you could be in there? Sure as hell wasn't me. You got 10 minutes to pack your bags, buddy. "Hey, I'm a baby." "Your mom let some weirdo nut in her" "and now I live in here." (chuckles) (light chaotic music) This could be fun. This could be great. God's plan, right? How'd you get out? I see this big worm, bathed in purple, come out of the mush. Scared all the other worms away. I heard him say "He's mine." "Leave him to me." And he says to me, "Because of your mother's prayers," "you work for God now." (Roscoe panting) [Samantha] Do you feel like we're one thing? [Jared] Yeah, I feel- Plugged in. You do? Yes. We're one thing. Transfer your energy to me and I'll do the same. Okay? Please do this for me. Okay, you ready? [Jared] Mm-hm, yeah. - Close your eyes. - Uh, okay. - Close your eyes. - Okay. [Samantha] Do you feel it? I wanna feel it. I'm sorry it's only 2%. Thirsty baby. I met your mom today. I think you're gonna love her. She's great. We didn't like do the thing, you know? But it felt like we did, plus she's like so beautiful and nice. I think she's gonna help us. I think she's gonna help you become more real. Everything's got a purpose. Everything's gotta do what it's gotta do. I think I can help you.

I wanted the window to be open, that's- [Jared] Anyways. We were wondering if we could have the house for the night. I'm, I'm just gonna do some worms. What are worms? Shut up, Jared. [Samantha] Oh.

In echopraxia, the equation of body to land become literal, natural. Delusions become of the earth. Similar to a poem. Similar to a worm. What is echopraxia? When an insane man watches television and sees himself in its message, echopraxia is when he follows the message's order. You must realize your full potential. Realize your full potential.

[Worm King] What's your favorite shape, Henrietta? I like octagons. [Worm King] How many sides does that have? Eight. [Worm King] Wrong! An octagon has an infinite number of sides and points. An octagon is just a misunderstanding. You have to unlearn your shapes. Okay. [Worm King] Your shapes are all wrong. Once you unlearn your shapes, you can do anything. There are no more rules. Yo Dennis. [Worm King] Nothing is real, and everything is permitted. Yeah, man? I didn't used to with queers. You feel me? [Young Henrietta] So I can do this? Yeah, me neither. Yeah, but then I realized that dude's fuck anything. Like you can love anything. Fuck any damn thing. Like, I got a dick, so I'm gonna fuck with it. [Worm King] You must realize your full potential. [Young Henrietta] Realize my full potential? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Dude. What, what? What the fuck, man? I'm not about that shit. What the fuck? No, wait. No, you were just talking that you- [Benny] Not now. There's too much fucking shit going on, dude. You know what, Benny? Fuck you, man! Fuck- My baby drowned at the beach! [Dennis] Huh?

That's all I wanna do, is just watch a little bit of TV and I can't even fuckin' do that. Like, it doesn't seem to have, they don't seem to have any sense of what human beings really like wanna watch, you know? So I have to go stab a homeless guy or something, you know? Whatever. I'm not saying it's right. Hey, hey, hey. What's up? You got any worms tonight? You look familiar. (moped motor sputtering) [Benny] You bitch, bitch! [Roscoe] Benny!

Over here? No, I'm really not seeing any of the worms. (laughing) Where the fuck are the worms? Where the fuck are the worms? [Shopkeeper] It's the wrong season. (Shopkeeper groaning) (Shopkeeper coughing) (doorbell rings) (Shopkeeper wailing) There's no worms. There's no worms. (Shopkeeper coughing) (tense music) You okay, chief? [Roscoe] They got cigarettes? Oh, cigarettes. You want some cigarettes now that you've seen a bleeding guy. You're a big smoker, huh? Enjoy. [Shopkeeper] It's the wrong season. [Roscoe] Why'd you stab that guy? He looks like every other faceless person I've seen and forgotten. (Shopkeeper choking) (tense music) [Biff] He's suffering, Roscoe. (Shopkeeper coughing) (Biff laughing) (tense music) (Roscoe grunting) [Biff] Oh, oh, oh, oh! (guts squish) (tense music) (Worm King screaming) [Worm King] You have to unlearn your shapes. Your shapes are all wrong. (Work King laughs) (van sputtering) Man. Benny, your problem is you never unlearned your own shapes. Your shapes are all wrong. What a shitty day this turned out to be, dude. These guys are way not cool. I'm the cool one now. (suspenseful music) (people laughing) [Biff] What do we got here, huh? (Biff laughs) Look at this guy. [Kelsey] He's so cute. [Biff] Oh my God. [Kelsey] He looks like a nice guy. Oh, he says hello. [Biff] Hey, take this beer, man. Take that. Chuck it. [Kelsey] Yeah, throw the beer. [Biff] Throw the beer. [Kelsey] Throw the beer. (chanting) - [Couple] Throw the beer! [Kelsey] Yeah, throw the beer. [Biff] Throw the beer. [Kelsey] Throw the beer. [Couple] Throw the beer, throw the beer, throw the beer! (Biff screaming) (Kelsey squealing) [Couple] Throw the beer, throw the beer, throw the beer! Throw the beer, throw the beer, throw the beer! (beer smacking) [Biff] Throw the beer, yeah! [Kelsey] Oh, he did. (Biff chuckles) [Benny] Roscoe, what the fuck did you do, man? What the fuck? Dennis! Dennis! Hey man, you all right? [Benny] Dennis! (melancholy music) Hey, dude. Dude, are you okay? (Couple laughing) (on TV) - [Interviewer] We return with [Biff] Come on, buddy boy. [Interviewer] Angelo Ingelian. [Biff] Welcome to the party. [Interviewer] He died and went to hell. [Roscoe] Hey, it was just a can. Do you think Dennis is okay? [Angelo] Yes, I went to hell. [Interviewer] What did you find there? [Angelo] I ate the demon's cuisine. Since I experienced the worms of hell, I eat them to remind me of the path to righteousness. [Biff] Get down there. [Kelsey] We want some worms. Want worms. - [Biff] Oh yeah? [Roscoe] Give me some worms, please, pal? I want worms right now. Yeah, you do. [Kelsey] Yeah, we want worms. Yeah, we all want the worms, but do you want the worms? - [Roscoe] I want the worms. - [Biff] Here come the worms. [Kelsey] Yeah. (worms squishing) (Couple laughing) [Kelsey] Welcome to the worm hole. (TV static buzzing) Sorry for your shit life, worm fuck. (ominous music) This is gonna feel kinda shitty. What are you gonna do? Um, I don't know. I've just been having a hard time telling the difference between a dream and real life. You know? This feels really real. [Biff] Yeah, but that's just because you're looking out through those two fucked up eyes of yours. You know? No, man, this is definitely real life. See, I've always had a hard time telling what is real. It's like the internet tells you things and then doctors tell you something else, and then your family and all of this stuff. Do, you know what I mean, right? Like I just- [Kelsey] Try these wormies. (tense music) Okay, I don't think I like this. (tense music) [Biff] What do you got for him? Oh, we've got something really amazing. [Biff] What do you got? (Benny screaming) He's got a boner. Is that a boner? Is that a boner! (laughs) (Couple laughing) [Kelsey] Ooh, look at that.

I didn't cum inside you. How could it be my baby? I didn't even come at all, Henrietta. (tense music) All the sins of the world are collected by the earth. They seep into the soil and are consumed by the worms. The dirt becomes the worm. The worm becomes the man and the man becomes dirt. And my baby will absorb the burden of man. [Benny] Your baby.
