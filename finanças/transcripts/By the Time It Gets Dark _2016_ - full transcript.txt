What are you looking at? Heads down! Heads down in the front row. Crouch down. Don't look up. No talking to each other. More brutal! Be more brutal! Just walk in. Hands behind your back. Kick them if you want. Feet together! Point the guns at them! Keep your head down! Don't fall asleep! Be tougher on them! Keep guarding! BY THE TIME IT GETS DARK - It's beautiful, isn't it? - Yes, it's incredible. I knew you'd like it. I fell in love with it the first time I came. That's why I brought you here. Well, that's everything. If there's nothing else, I'll excuse myself. I've a meeting at the community centre. - You have my number, right? - Yes, you can go now. - You don't want to be late. - Bye for now. Let me show you the house. - It's nice. - Yes. There's another bedroom upstairs. This room is bigger. I think you should take it. I'll sleep downstairs. - You should take it. - No, you should. Really, I'd prefer you to have it. I don't like big bedrooms anyway. How strange. By the way, can we have our first session this afternoon? If you're not too tired from the trip... No, that's fine. When shall we start? Around 3:00pm so you'll have time to rest. Then I'll rest for an hour or two. OK, me too. I didn't get much sleep last night. Are you ready? Yes. What do you prefer? Short or long answers? As you wish. Take as much time as you need. OK. Ready. It's recording. The story of your change from the 'It Girl' at university to a protest leader is very well-known. I'd like to go back a bit. Can you tell me about your childhood? I was born in Sri Racha, in Chonburi. My father was in the navy. When he was 30, he was stationed at the navy base in Sattahib. That's where I grew up. Back then Sattahib was a really small town. But for a young girl like me who'd never been to a city, of course I wouldn't have known just how small it was. Everybody knew each other. You were an only child, right? Yes. I think my parents wanted to have another child. A boy. But they weren't able to. And what was it like growing up as an only child? Great. Just great. People often think that it must be lonely, being an only child. Most parents want more than one so the children can play together. I was just glad I didn't have to share my parents, or rather, their love, with anyone. It wasn't until I went to university that I realised how sheltered I had been. I didn't know how to do much for myself... ...while all my friends were completely capable. So I wanted to be like them. But how could he accept a cabinet position? This government has no legitimacy. Don't forget how they came to power. On the back of a military coup! For our rector to accept a post in this cabinet is a total disgrace. It shows he's just a power-hungry animal. It's like he's spitting in our faces, saying "fuck you" to democracy! But if he doesn't accept, someone else will. It could even be an army general. Then we'll be seriously fucked. Yes. At least an academic is better than a soldier. Is that our only choice, an academic or a soldier? At least he's our rector. He's a good man. - What's a 'good' man? - He's not corrupt. The fact that he sided with the coup means that he has no respect for our university. Why don't we give him a chance? The chance for a cabinet position is not a rector's responsibility! Right. I can't accept this. I'm going to protest outside the Students' Union tomorrow morning. I need to prepare banners and flyers tonight. - Anyone going to help me? - Count me in. Me too. Good. Thanks. Hurry up, before the guards get here. GET OUT, DICTATOR! What the hell?! We should go now, Comrade! Let's buy some water. How many bottles would you like? That's not enough. - Wow. - I drink a lot. Did you sleep well? Yes, I did. This place is so quiet. You can hear a lot of insects, especially at night. Aren't you hungry? Don't you want any breakfast? I'll have something to eat in a bit. Your food looks good. It's quite tasty. Excuse me, where are the coffee beans from? - We use Maneepruek coffee here. - Maneepruek? Yes, it's the local bean. Do you know it? The supplier is an American guy but he speaks fluent Thai, even the local dialect. - It tastes good. - Thank you. Are you here on vacation? Not really. We're here to work on a film script. Wow, really? What kind of film? Well, it's a drama... of sorts. I'm writing a script based on the life of this lady here. You're embarrassing me. I don't think kids these days know about me. Taew is a famous writer. Don't say any more. And if you're writing about her life, you must be a writer too, then? No, I'm actually a film director. But I like to write my own scripts. You should give it to her to write. She's a writer. Yes, you're right. And it's about her life, so it's her story. You're quite right. Maybe I will. Thanks for the tip. - Can I order some breakfast, please? - Yes. - Do you have rice soup? - Yes, with pork or chicken? We can also do mushrooms. Mushrooms sound good. What kind do you have? Shiitake and oyster mushrooms. The oyster mushrooms are fresh from the farm this morning. OK. I'll have the oyster mushrooms, then. What made you decide to join the movement? No matter how many times I've been asked that, it's never been easy to answer. I guess there isn't really one answer. It was a combination of things. You have to understand that back then we really fought for what we believed in. There was no money involved. No one hired you to protest, unlike nowadays. When we saw something unjust, we protested. We wanted to put things right. We wanted democracy. It simply wasn't an option for me not to join. What did your parents think? My father was very much against the idea. As for my mother, even though she didn't really agree she didn't stop me. I'm her daughter, after all. Did you ever think that your fight wouldn't succeed? Not at all. Succeeding or not wasn't an issue. We did our best as it was our responsibility. Do you think you made a sacrifice? Yes. I think it was. Were you scared? No. When the situation became more heated, I felt vengeful because we were the victims. We were the victims. You've been through so much in your life. If you had a chance to talk to your younger self, would you have anything to say to her? No. Was there any romance back then? Yes. With another student? Yes. Can you tell me more? This is how we grow our mushrooms, the traditional way. Do we have a flashlight? I think I saw some candles in the kitchen. What are you looking at? Our reflections on the TV screen. It's quite beautiful. You know, I've never asked you this, but why did you want to make a film based on my life? I don't know. You don't know or you don't want to tell me? It's... It's hard to explain really. But I feel that you've lived through so much, when I read books on October 1976 and think of you having been in the midst of it all. And that you're still here. It's like... ...you're living history. Your life is meaningful. A life worth living. Whereas me, I appropriate someone's life and turn it into a film. Maybe because my life is quite mundane. There's one thing you're wrong about. I'm not living history. I'm just a survivor. Would you sing me a song? The moon The moon shines so beautifully Wow, how come you picked such an old song? It's a song I remember well from my childhood. Don't tease me I'm just a moon Hiding in the clouds When the clouds disappear The moon will reappear in the sky But it won't come down Well, I think I'll go to bed now. Goodnight. When I was a kid, about 7 or 8 years old, I used to practise telekinesis. I read that you can move an object just by staring at it and you can control it with your mind. I began practising this... ...but only when I was by myself, because... ...I didn't want anyone to know my secret. One day, it happened. I... I was concentrating on an empty glass. Suddenly, it started to move. I was so excited... I tried to keep calm. My bedroom door was unlocked. I was afraid someone might walk in. But luckily, no one did. I concentrated very hard. I was able to move it around, left and right. But not very much each time, just a few inches. Then, I concentrated even harder. Then... ...the glass moved about one foot across the table... I... ...got very excited. At the same time, I was so exhausted... ...and scared... I... I felt... I felt like I'd used up all my energy. So I decided to stop for the day. I remember going to bed that night. I couldn't get to sleep for a long time. That was probably the first time I experienced insomnia. Maybe I was too excited. But it never came back again. I still don't know exactly why. Maybe because I told my best friend at school the next day during lunch break. I don't know... No matter how many times I tried, even with lighter objects, like a pen, even then... ...it never worked again. Since then, I've never talked about it. Slowly, slowly Gently, gently A flock of birds have flown But a bird, a single bird Is all alone like me A heart, a bleeding heart Beats so slowly My love, why do you avoid me? O dearest, you are too cold Does anyone know such pain Caused by the absence of a loved one Once I had you by my side Now it's as if that never happened Keep talking... About the sky and the earth Night after night, time passes It's as if nothing ever happened Taew, please go inside or you'll get wet. It's ok. I've got it. It's beautiful, isn't it? Yes, it's incredible. I fell in love with it first time I came here. I thought you'd like it. That's why I wanted to bring you here. Well, that's everything. Please excuse me. I have a meeting at the community centre. Are you sure you're OK with a motorbike? I can ask my friend to lend you a car. Where did you find this little guardian angel? I'd better be off then. - You have my number, right? - Yes, I do. See you. Let me show you the house. There's another bedroom upstairs. - Shall we take a look? - Sure. This room is a little bit bigger. I think you should take it. I think you should take this one. No, I'll take the one downstairs. I prefer small bedrooms. - Really? - Sure. OK, then. Can we start this afternoon? If you're not too tired from the trip... No, that's fine. It's still early. I have time to rest, right? Yes, of course. It's only 10 o'clock. What time do you usually have lunch? Around 12:00. So, I'll rest for a bit and we'll have lunch later? Yes. I'll be downstairs if you need anything. Please make yourself at home. I like your eyes. I like your ears. I like your lips. Do you love me? The weather's good today. Please don't lie to me Darling, don't lie to me Even if you don't tell me One day the wind will call on me I'm not ready to face the truth Because once I wanted to share my life with you Please don't lie to me Darling, don't lie to me Although we still see each other every day But I see the changes in your eyes The sweetness in your voice has gone, long gone Please don't lie to me Darling, don't lie to me - Do you want it? - Sure. Two bottles of beer, please. And another bucket of ice. The crab here is really good. Better than the place yesterday. Don't enjoy it too much. Aren't you on a diet? Crab isn't fatty. It's just high in cholesterol. I was only joking. Don't get so defensive. Eat this. Just get on that boat, the two of you. Peter, what are you up to these days? Same old, same old. Still working with the prince. But I just got an interesting offer. It's an indie film. Indie means... ...not much money. Typical. I'm quite tempted because the director said she wrote the part for me. Directors always say that. "I wrote this part just for you." You're a fool to believe that. Damn. - Maybe I'm a fool this time. - You're always like that. In fact, I've always been a fool. Excuse me. Peter, can I take a photo with you? Sure. - Can you, please? - Of course. Wait! Her friends... One... two... three... Thank you. Thank you, Ton. Your birthday present. - Whose birthday? - New Year present. Christmas present. So sweet. All wrapped up in one. This weather makes me drowsy. - Hey, Peter! - Tak. How are you? Haven't seen you in ages. - Pun, this is Peter. - Hi, Peter. Hi, Pun. This is Chompoo. Chompoo, this is Tak. Of course, I know who she is. - How are you doing? - I'm fine. And you? I'm fine. Shooting a few films right now. - What about you? - I'm taking a break for now. I want to concentrate on my own film... as a director. Oh really? That's great. Are you going out now? Yeah, we just got here and Pun's hungry. We just had a big lunch too. I'm so sleepy now! Well, I won't keep you. Best of luck with the project. Thank you. Bye. - I'm full. - No wonder you are. 6 kilos of crab and beer too. Hello? Yes. I can talk. What? When? I'm very sorry to hear that. What happened? Peter has just died in a car accident. Our Peter? Yes. When? A few hours ago. We're almost done. Shall we continue? We're almost done. Shall we continue? Let's continue. Pang, go ahead. "You're home late again. Speak tomorrow, Mum." Then... ...the radio broadcast was going on non-stop. It was getting late, so I went to bed. When I woke up in the morning, I went downstairs and I heard what had happened at Thammasat University. The TV station... Channel 9 had broadcast footage of the shootings that had taken place. What I saw shocked me deeply because I hadn't expected such violence on this scale. For example, the image of... ...people who were forced to lie face down on the football pitch. The military backed students, the Red Gaurs, the Village Scouts and other unspecified groups who were beating them down and dragging the dead bodies out to burn them. I saw the image of people being burned beneath a pile of car tyres and set on fire. I might have read about the methods with which the government clamped down on what they called "the terrorists". They'd be thrown out of helicopters or set on fire in oil barrels. I had never seen such brutality with my own eyes. It made me... It just left me cold... and drained. I recall collapsing into a chair and just staring at the images in front of me. I couldn't believe my eyes. Then... ...the next thing... ...that came into my head was that I couldn't stay here any longer. I couldn't... I couldn't live in a society that allowed this to happen. Buddhism shall continue to flourish around the world. And the lives of its devotees will prosper... ...and shine as brightly as hundreds of thousands of lanterns lit by devotees on the magical night of Makha Bucha, an auspicious day, significant to the world and the universe.
