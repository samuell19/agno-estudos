(siren blaring drowning out dispatch) (car chiming) - [Helen] Come on, according to you, you're helpless, which makes you a punt. And I cannot believe you are doing this to me when I entered this relationship with the assumption that we would be honest with each other. - You know what? We'll toss this around in person as soon as you pay the ransom. - What? - What ransom? - [Darryl] The 45 thousand dollars the person pointing a gun at me demands for my safe return. - But it's almost midnight on a Friday... - Ransom. - Popped out. - Just came to you in a... - Second or third spontaneous act of my life. - Well, it makes me look like a... - Like what? - Like a... - A woman who might take money out of desperation from others? Here. We need a gas station or an oil well. - Go home, Darryl. - Go? - Home. - But I'm your hostage, I have obligations! What are you gonna do? - Not your problem. Lay low, think. - Well, let's think, where can you hide a 30 foot tin can with a dead guy in the cigar box? - Go on, just get your things and get out of here. - No. - You don't get to decide, Darryl! - Trust me. - Oh, I will never, ever trust another one of you. (solemn music) Help me. 'Cause I'm scared and I don't know where to go or what to do. - I don't know what you should do either. But I know where to go. Even if the cops check the main house, no one will think to bring them down the irrigation canals this far out. - Whose orchard is it? - My family's. - Your family farms pecans? - Well, mom's. Since the mid 1600s, she runs the business. My sister is prepping to take over. - 1600s. - Spanish Jews fleeing the Inquisition to Mexico. - What happened? - All the god fearing Catholics decided to rid the world... - No, I mean, what did Helen do?

We can change. We can change, Darryl. (phone ringing) - Hello, Helen. - I have the money, what do I do with it? Bumbie? - She has the money. - Darryl? - I don't want it. - Take it, pay you back, 10 bucks a month. - [Helen] Darryl? - Who knows about the money? Banker, me. - [Darryl] No cops? - I am a cop, Darryl, I am the law. Just tell me where to go and I will handle it from there. It's me, Bumbie. - How do we know we can trust you? - [Helen] We? - How do we know? - Oh, playing the Stockholm Syndrome ruse. Good, sorry, got it, smart. Tell her that I will come alone because I don't want to deal with the embarrassment and public attention that this will bring. - Okay, well, you have to really come alone. - And I will. - I mean really. - Get the shit out of your ears, Bumbie, tell her I said I would.

Be indispensable! - I like being with you! - Darryl! You need a mother, and I am past my childbearing years. You're a kid. - But I'm gonna grow up, change, like you said. - I do not want you, Darryl, we are not available to each other. - But hell, you could be. Available to each other. - Helen, Amelia, Amie, Hel. - Shalom, Mrs. Philips. Where's Mr. Philips? - Not with us. - Not with you where? - Out of the picture. (solemn music) - Look, you don't know what happened between Amelia and Jack. - Between them, not you and them? You and her. - I told you, I didn't know her before, okay, look, they wrestled over a gun, it went off. - So when you say your husband is out of the picture, you mean... - That it was a justifiable homicide, he hit her. She was defending her life. Tell her she won't go to jail. - I'm afraid I can't do that on your world alone, Darryl. - If somebody hit you and verbally abused you, you'd kill them. - To the contrary, I would file charges against him under the law and put his ass in prison, just like I would any evildoer. - Amelia is not an evildoer. - I've got a SWAT team out there, Mrs. Philips. - Hey, you said you'd come alone! - Darryl, how was I to know you actually wanted me to come alone so you could run away with your captor and our life savings? Mrs. Philips, surrender to me and I am prepared to say you chose to trust the law to take its course. - But I don't. - You try to run, they'll kill you. And then it won't matter because you will leave a decreedence to decide that for you and they will feast on you like carrion birds. - My husband's dead in what appears to be foul play. I will not go to prison. - Tell me the truth, I'll try to believe you. Was your husband's death an accident? - I don't know. There was a gun, we wrestled, et cetera, et cetera. - Doesn't help me a lot, Mrs. Philips.- - Right, so step aside. - There's nobody out there, she wouldn't bring help. She wants to walk you in herself and be on Larry King Live. - Gee, Darryl, am I a different person than the one you woke up beside yesterday? - Maybe you're the same, but I... - Enlightenment under duress, do you know what a cliche that is? Oh, you haven't changed, Bumbie. - Who am I, Helen? - You are the same sweet, intelligent, erratic, neurotic impractical childishly romantic man child you have always been, despite all my efforts to help you to a viable reality. If I made a mistake there, please correct me. - What about Black Dog? - What Black Dog? (warm music) - Medication? - Don't need any. Give me the weapon, Mrs. Philips. - You sure there's no one out there? - Yup. - Yeah, hang on, let me just let 'em know they're not out there. Gentlemen, prepare to take... - (mumbles) step right this way, we've got a guided tour starting right now! - Put me down, get off! - [Darryl] Get in there, Helen, get the cuffs! - No, really? - Best idea of many bad ones. - [Helen] You are now an accessory! - [Darryl] Don't worry, it'll be just fine. (Helen grunting) Watch your foot, watch your foot! - [Helen] Darryl, indicate to me that you are aware that when I bring charges... - One minute, Helen, then let the recriminations begin. (soft music) - I gotta go. - Stay. - I can't. We are not in love, Darryl, we are in empathy. And maybe that's better. But I'll tell you this, if I can, I will let you know how I am. Maybe we'll see each again. If you promise to write me a story. A good one, a real... And funny. (soft, tense music) (dog barking) - Danger, come here, come here. You're a good girl. (warm Spanish guitar music) (singing in foreign language) - Darryl? What in the world is this in the toilet? - [Darryl] Jack. - Did you kiss her, Darryl? - Yeah. - Good. Bumbie. I only put your half of our savings in the bag. I only put 225 in the bag. Now let me out of here. Darryl, I mean it. You know what? Never mind. Locked up here is good, I'm safe here while the rest of you whack jobs... Leave me. Bring me my bankie and pillow. - What did you just say? - [Helen] My bankie. (laughing) - [Dispatch] All units, on that APB for lovebirds Amelia Jack Philips and potential homewrecker Darryl Tripp. Crashed on a bicycle. Let me confirm this. Dale Ser, PD advises a 1041 matching Mrs. Philips' description committed assault with a deadly weapon and grand larceny on a mortician's assistant as well as one, and we could be trailblazing here, folks, one, repeat, do know, forcible cremation.
