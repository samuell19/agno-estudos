WELCOME, ONE AND ALL, TO OUR LIVE ELECTION SPECIAL. I AM YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. I'M WEARING A SUIT TONIGHT BECAUSE IT IS THE ELECTION. I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE NICE. I DRESSED UP. I THOUGHT YOU WOULD, TOO. I'M NOT ALONE. I HAVE THE TWO MASKED MEN WHO ARE NORMALLY IN HERE. I WOULD LOVE TO LEARN THEIR NAMES SOME DAY. MY LADY WIFE IS THERE. SHE'S RIGHT OVER THERE. SHE'S HAD A LITTLE WINE. BUT SHE'S A CORE DEMOGRAPHIC. SHE'S A SUBURBAN WOMAN. AS SHE GOES, SO GOES THE NATION. TONIGHT SHE'S GOING HOME WITH ME. TONIGHT WE'RE ON SHOWTIME JUST LIKE FOUR YEARS AGO, AND WE KNOW WHY WE'RE HERE BECAUSE IT'S LIVE. BUT WE DON'T KNOW SOME WHAT SOME OF THE INGREDIENTS OF TONIGHT'S SHOW WILL BE. AT THIS POINT, IT'S LIKE WE'RE MAKING COOKIES AND WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO BE IN THE BATCH. AS WE JOURNEY INTO THE UNKNOWN, PLEASE BE PATIENT WITH US AND YOURSELF. HOLD ON TIGHT. HOLD ON TO YOUR LOVED ONESMENT HOLD ON TO YOUR PETS. IF YOU ARE HOLDING ON TO ANYTHING ELSE, TURN YOUR ZOOM CAMERA OFF. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE ASKING ME WHY WE'RE DOING THIS AGAIN. WE DID IT FOUR YEARS AGO, AND IT WAS, QUITE FAMOUSLY, A PAINFUL EXPERIENCE. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? I WOULDN'T WANT TO BE WITH ANYBODY ELSE THAN YOU RIGHT NOW AND ONLY PARTLY BECAUSE WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO LEAVE NEW YORK RIGHT NOW. I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE ON SHOWTIME BECAUSE HOLY SHIT. IT IS A WEIRD FUCKING ELECTION. FIRST OF ALL, WE'RE IN A PANDEMIC. SO BEFORE THE POLLS OPENED, 99.7 MILLION AMERICANS ALREADY VOTED. A LOT WERE SENT BY MAIL. AS WE SPEAK THE GOP IS MARKING HARD TO DISQUALIFY VOTES ON TECHNICALITIES AND BASELESS CHARGES OF FRAUD. YOU KNOW THE OLD SAYING. IF YOU CAN'T BEAT THEM, FIND A JUDGE WHO SAYS, NO, ACTUALLY YOU DID BEAT THEM. NOW, DOUBT ABOUT WHETHER THE ELECTION WILL BE FAIR OR NOT HAS RAISED FEAR OF VIOLENCE IN THE STREETS. ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, RETAILERS ARE BOARDING UP THEIR WINDOWS. IT'S BEEN A BANNER DAY FOR JIM'S DOOMSDAY PLYWOOD. JIM'S IS ACTUALLY OPEN. THE PLYWOOD IS JUST ALWAYS UP THERE. NOW, BUSINESSES THE EVERYWHERE ARE TAKING PRECAUTIONS. CVS IS PROTECTING ITS WINDOWS WITH A SINGLE GATORADE. AS WE SPEAK, JOE BIDEN IS IN DELAWARE. THE PRESIDENT IS AT THE WHITE HOUSE. IF EITHER OF THEM COMES OUT TO SPEAK TONIGHT DURING THIS SHOW, AND DO WE HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO DO THIS? WE ARE PREPARED NOT TO GO TO EITHER ONE OF THEM BECAUSE THIS IS MY SHOW. GET YOUR OWN SHOW, FELLAS. WHILE THIS IS A COMEDY SHOW SO FAR, THE RESULTS YOU'LL BE HEARING ARE REAL. WE'RE GETTING STRAIGHT FROM CBS, FROM THE PIPE THEY JACK IN TO THE BACK OF JOHN DICKERSON'S HEAD. AT THE WHITE HOUSE, THE PRESIDENT IS THROWING A PARTY. IS THAT HAPPENING? IT'S STILL HAPPENING. HE'S PLANNED 250 GUESTS DOWN TO 400. TRUMP WANTED TO KEEP IT TO HIS NEAREST AND NEAREST CODEFENDANTS. ONCE AGAIN, A LARGE INDOOR GATHERING DURING A PANDEMIC. IF HE LOSES, HE CAN SEAL HIS ADMINISTRATION IN WITH HIM LIKE A PHARAOH'S TOME. HE HAS GOLD WALLS AND HIS DEMONIC ESCORT INTO THE UNDERWORLD. AND TO KEEP TRUMP SAFE FROM THE ELECTION UNREST THAT HE'S COUNTING ON HAPPENING, THE GOVERNMENT HAS ERECTED A NONSCALEABLE FENCE AROUND THE WHITE HOUSE. SO IN THE END, THEY BUILT THE WALL AND LOCKED HIM UP. PROMISES MADE, PROMISES KEPT. YESTERDAY WAS BOTH CANDIDATES LAST CHANCE TO MAKE A TRIP TO SEE VOTERS. LAST NIGHT BIDEN WAS IN PENNSYLVANIA. HE BROUGHT OUT LADY GAGA. THE BEST HE'S EVER GOTTEN WAS POP SENSATION LADY RUDY. THOUGH, IT IS REFRESHING TO SEE RUDY IN THE COMEDY BIT WHERE HE'S NOT TOUCHING HIMSELF. SO IN ONE OF HIS CLOSING RALLIES, TRUMP LASHED OUT AT BIDEN'S POP STAR FRIEND. > > LADY GAGA IS NOT TOO GOOD. I COULD TELL YOU PLENTY OF STORIES. I COULD TELL YOU STORIES ABOUT LADY GAGA. I KNOW A LOT OF STORIES ABOUT LADY GAGA. > > WHAT? YOU HAVE GOTS OF STORIES ABOUT LADY GAGA? THEN WHY DO YOU KEEP TELLING ONE ABOUT THE SUPER STRONG RANCHER THAT DOESN'T GO TO PARIS ANYMORE. OR THE WIFE THAT SUDDENLY LOVES HER HUSBAND BECAUSE THEIR 401(k) IS DOING WELL? STOP WASTING TIME. STILL THE GAGA TEA! THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN DOUBLED DOWN ON THIS WITH A TWEET. NOTHING EXPOSES BIDEN'S DISDAIN FOR THE FORGOTTEN WORKING MEN AND WOMEN OF PENNSYLVANIA LIKE CAMPAIGNING WITH ANTI-FRACKING ACTIVIST LADY GAGA. YES. WHO CAN FORGET HER BIG HIT? > > FRACK. THE GROUND. > > THAT SONG GETS ME. THAT SONG GETS ME EVERY TIME. TRUMP ENDED THE CAMPAIGN WITH THIS CLINCHING CLOSING ARGUMENT IN THE FORM OF A VIDEO HE POSTED AT 3:00 A.M. ON ELECTION DAY. > > I PROMISE YOU, WE DID NOT MAKE THAT UP. THEY PUT THAT OUT. DONALD TRUMP IS THE ONLY CANDIDATE PROMISING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE I WILL MASTURBATE TWO INVISIBLE GIRAFFES. ALL RIGHT. LIKE THE GIRAFFE JOKE? YOU DON'T. ALL RIGHT. WHAT'S GOING ON? IS IT TIME? IT'S TIME FOR SOME RESULTS. OKAY, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THESE ARE ACTUAL RESULTS THAT WE HAVE RECEIVED THANKS TO ADVANCED COMPUTER MODELING AND THE OCCASIONAL SINGING TELEGRAM WE HAVE BEEN RECEIVING FROM THE FUTURE. OKAY? WE'RE READY TO MAKE SOME CALLS. WHAT DO WE HAVE FIRST? MARYLAND. LET'S START IN MARYLAND WHERE CBS PROJECTS THAT JOE BIDEN HAS DEFEATED DONALD TRUMP. BUT MARYLAND AND I HAVE SO MUCH IN COMMON. WE'RE BOTH KNOWN FOR GIVING PEOPLE CRABS. WE CAN ALSO REPORT THAT VERMONT HAS BEEN CALLED FOR FORMER VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN. THE TICKET WAS GIVEN A HUGE BOOST THANKS TO BEN AND JERRY'S NEW FLAVOR, FORMER ICE PRESIDENT KAMALA-NANNA HARR REECES-PIECES. WE ARE NOW ABLE TO PROJECT THAT DELAWARE HAS BEEN WON BY JOE BIDEN. WELL, I SHOULD HOPE SO. IT'S HIS HOME STATE. THAT WOULD BE LIKE DONALD TRUMP LOSING NEW YORK. HE WHAT? THAT'S GOT TO STINK. WELL, AS I JUST PRETENDED TO HEAR FROM OFF CAMERA. NEW YORK STATE AND IT'S WHAPING 29 ELECTORAL VOTES HAS JUST BEEN CALLED FOR VICE PRESIDENT JOSEPH R. BIDEN. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY. IF YOU CAN MAKE IT HERE, YOU ARE NOT DONALD TRUMP. FURTHER SOUTH, THE NUMBER CALLERS HAVE CALLED THE NUMBERS. AND IT LOOKS LIKE KENTUCKY HAS GONE FOR DONALD TRUMP. AND, OH, LOOK, MITCH McCONNELL IS SO PROUD HE'S INFLATING HIS WADDLE. OH. IMPRESSIVE MATING GESTURE. WATCH OUT, LADIES. NO SURPRISE. DONALD TRUMP HAS ALSO WON TENNESSEE WHICH HAS AN ACTUAL STATE GUN. THE BARRETT.50 CALIBER M-82 WHICH I'M BEING TOLD HAS ALSO WON ITS SENATE SEAT. AND A LITTLE FURTHER WEST OR NORTH, I'M NOT SURE. INDIANA HAS JUST BEEN CALLED FOR DONALD TRUMP. WELL, OF COURSE. IT WAS EITHER VOTE FOR HIM OR TAKE MIKE PENCE BACK. THAT'S AN EASY CALL. AND FOR ANY OKIES WONDERING HOW YOUR PAN IS BEING HANDLED, I CAN REPORT IT IS BEING CALLED FOR DONALD TRUMP. YOU KNOW HOW THE SONG GOES OH, THE STATE WHERE THEY DON'T CARE TRUMP KILLED HERMAN CAIN. > > HOW ARE YOU DOING OVER THERE? CAN WE GET HER SOME WINE? THAT WOMAN NEEDS TO STAY IN WHATEVER STATE SHE'S IN RIGHT NOW. ANOTHER STATE HAS BEEN OFFICIALLY DECIDED. SOUTH DAKOTA IS BEING CALLED FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP. LET'S SEE HOW PEOPLE IN SOUTH DAKOTA ARE REACTING. AND -- > > AH, SHIT. > > OKAY. BACK EAST, I'M GETTING -- IS THIS TRUE? I'M GETTING BREAKING RESULTS FROM TWO HOURS AGO THAT NEW JERSEY HAS BEEN CALLED FOR JOE BIDEN. WELL, THAT MAKES SENSE. AFTER ALL THE FIRST EVER BASEBALL BECAME WAS PLAYED IN NEW JERSEY IN 1846, AND JOE BIDEN WAS THERE. YEP. STILL GOING TO DO THOSE JOKES, SIR. AND I'M GETTING THE RESULTS FROM MASSACHUSETTS WHO PROJECT THAT IT HAS GONE FOR JOE BIDEN. BIDEN WON THE HEARTS OF BOSTON WITH HIS STIRRING MESSAGE OF TELLING A GUY FROM NEW YORK TO SHUT THE HELL UP. WE CAN ALSO REPORT THAT NEW HAMPSHIRE HAS BEEN CALLED FOR FORMER PRESIDENT BIDEN. LIVE FREE OR DIE ISN'T JUST THE MOTTO, IT WAS THE TWO CHOICES ON THE BALLOT. AND AS LONG AS WE'RE LEAF PEEPING IN LEAF PEEPING COUNTRY, I THINK I KNOW WHAT THAT SENTENCE MEANS, JOE BIDEN HAS WON CONNECTICUT. YES. TURNS OUT THE CONSTITUTION, THEY PREFER SOMEONE WHO HAS READ THE CONSTITUTION. IT WAS A SQUEAKER. ONLY GAVE BIDEN A 99% OF WINNING. THEY FELT BIDEN REPRESENTED THEIR CORE OF CONNECTICUT VALUES OF ENJOYING FLEECE SWEATER VESTS. ALL DAY WE'VE BEEN WAITING ON RESULTS FROM COLORADO. AND NOW WE'VE GOT THEM. AND IT LOOKS LIKE JOE BIDEN JUST WON COLORADO. HERE IS AN INTERESTING FACT. COLORADO HAS A LONG HISTORY OF VOTING BY MAIL. IN THIS YEAR'S STATE PRIMARIES, 99.3% OF VOTERS USED MAIL-IN BALLOTS. THE REMAINING 0.7% COULD NOT BECAUSE THEY HAD TURNED THEIR MAILBOX INTO A BONG. THERE IS MORE. I WAS GOING TO GO ON TO SOMETHING ELSE, BUT MY YOUNG PAGE HERE IS HANDING ME RESULTS HERE. THANK YOU, SHOE SHINE BOY. WHAT'S THE TOP ONE HERE? ILLINOIS, WE ARE READY TO CALL THAT JOSEPH BIDEN HAS WON EASILY ILLINOIS. ANOTHER BEAUTIFUL GIFT FROM THE STATE THAT HAS GIVEN US ABRAHAM LINCOLN, BARACK OBAMA, JACK FORD BUT ALSO JOHN WAYNE GUYSY. DON'T GET COCKY, ILLINOIS. MISSOURI, MISSOURI. I AM NOT PRETENDING THAT THIS NEWS HAS JUST BEEN HANDED TO ME. MISSOURI HAS JUST BEEN CALLED FOR DONALD TRUMP. APPARENTLY THE SHOW ME STATE LIKES THE GUY WHOSE ENTIRE SHOW IS ME. ALL RIGHT. WHAT ELSE DO I GOT HERE? IS THIS UTAH? UTAH HAS JUST BEEN CALLED FOR DONALD TRUMP. THIS IS INTERITSESTING. MITT ROMNEY SAID HE DIDN'T VOTE FOR HIM, INSTEAD FOLLOWED HIS PASSION AND VOTED FOR UNSALTED CRACKER. UTAH KNOWN FOR TWO THINGS, THEIR BREATH TAKING NATURAL SLENDER AND THEIR INTENSE DESIRE TO DESTROY IT. NOW THIS ONE, THIS ONE I DID NOT EXPECT RIGHT AWAY. THIS HAS GOT TO COME AS A SHOCKER TO EVERYONE IN A COMA. JOE BIDEN HAS WON THE GOLDEN STATE CALIFORNIA. WITH CALIFORNIA, BECAUSE OF HOW THE VOTES ARE TALLIED, WE MAY NOT KNOW THE OFFICIAL RESULTS FOR QUITE A WHILE. SO WITH 0% REPORTING, AND THIS IS TRUE, WITH 0% REPORTING, BECAUSE, COME ON, IT'S CALIFORNIA AND THIS ISN'T THE NEWS, OKAY? ALL RIGHT. IS THAT IT? NOW CAN I MOVE ON TO THE OTHER JOKES? MORE JOKES OVER HERE. HERE, HAVE THESE COMPOSTED. FOLKS, IF YOU WATCH ELECTION COVERAGE AND SPOILER, YOU ARE RIGHT NOW, YOU KNOW THAT THE NEWS NETWORKS ALWAYS HAVE A PANEL OF EXPERTS TO HELP THEM BREAK DOWN THE BREAKING NEWS. IN CNN'S CASE SO THE DIRECTOR HAS SOMETHING TO CUT TO WHEN JOHN KING GETS INTO HANDSY WITH HIS PROJECTOR. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS QUANTITY. BACK IN 2016, THEY HAD NO LESS THAN NINE DIFFERENT PEOPLE WEIGHING IN ON THE RESULTS. MEANING, THEY HAD MORE PEOPLE DISCUSSING THE VOTERS OF WYOMING THEN THERE ARE VOTERS IN WYOMING. WELL, I WILL NOT SIT HERE TO BE OUTQUANTITIES BY CNN. TONIGHT I'M PROUD TO PRESENT OUR NEW SEGMENT, THE MOST ELECTION NIGHT PANEL EVER. WITH ME TONIGHT ARE SOME OF THE MOST NAMES IN THE BIZ. LET'S MEET THEM NOW. MY OLD PAL JOHN DICKERSON. > > I'M HONORED AND CONTRACTUALLY OBLIGATED TO BE HERE, STEPHEN. > > RIGHT YOU ARE. > > HERE TO GIVE US THE INSIDER PERSPECTIVE, SOMEBODY WHO RAN, FORMER COLORADO GOVERNOR. > > ACTUALLY, STEPHEN, I'M MICHAEL BENNETT, THE COLORADO SENATOR. > > NICE TRY. WE'D NEVER BE ABLE TO BOOK A MICHAEL BENNETT. THAT DUDE IS A ROCK STAR. > > IT'S THE ECONOMY, STUPID. > > DON'T CALL ME, STUPID, YOU CAJUN MALL RAT. NEXT WE HAVE ANDREW YANG WHO RAN ON THE SLOGAN MATH. HOW ARE THE NUMBERS LOOKING TO BE THE? > > THEY'RE LOOKING GREAT. 3 AND 5 ARE VISUALLY APPEALING. 11 HAS PERFECT SIMILAR MET TRY. THESE NUMBERS LOOK FANTASTIC. > > ONLY TIME WILL TELL. > > WE HAVE NEIL DEGRASS TYSON. > > TONIGHT I PREDICT THE UNIVERSE WILL DIE OF HEAT DEATH IN TEN TO THE POWER OF 100 YEARS. > > WELL, I BELIEVE OHIO MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT THAT. AND TO DISCUSS HOW COVID MIGHT BE AFFECTING THE CASE, WE WANTED A DOCTOR, DR. J. > > I'M NOT A MEDICAL DOCTOR, STEPHEN. > > LET'S STAY IN OUR LANES. WE HAVE FORMER SECRETARY OF THE STATE MADELEINE ALBRIGHT. > > WHERE ARE MY PANCAKES? > > WE'RE FAXING THEM TO YOU NOW, MADAM SECRETARY. > > AND WE HAVE A USED SEA DOO SALESMAN ON METH. > > ARE YOU A COP? > > WE'RE LUCKY TO BE JOINED BY ONE OF THE GREAT, BRIAN KRANS TON. > > THIS DISH NEVER FAILS TO IMPRESS. > > ACTUALLY, BRIAN. THIS IS AN ELECTION SPECIAL, NOT A COOKING SHOW. > > RIGHT. BUT YOU CAN PREPARE THIS DISH WAY AHEAD OF TIME BEFORE THE PARTY, AND IT WILL BE READY BY THE TIME YOUR GUESTS ARRIVE. > > ALSO JOINING US, THE FLY THAT WAS ON MIKE PENCE'S HEAD DURING THE DEBATE. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US, MR. FLY. > > ACTUALLY, THAT FLY WAS MY GREAT, GREAT, GREAT, GREAT GRANDFATHER. WE HAVE VERY SHORT LIFE SPANS. NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, I HAVE TO DEPOSIT EGGS IN HIS SCALP. > > WE'VE ALSO GOT EXPERT ANALYSIS FROM A MEMBER OF THE WU TANG CLAN, METHOD MAN. > > STEPHEN, VOTER TURNOUT IS HIGHER THAN IT'S BEEN IN DECADE. SO AM I. > > WE ALL HAVE TO GET THROUGH THIS ELECTION SOMEHOW. > > WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR TONIGHT, RU? > > WELL, MAINE AND NEBRASKA ARE THE ONLY TWO STATES THAT ALLOW A SPLIT IN THEIR STATE'S ELECTORS, SO I WANT TO CELEBRATE THEIR DESIRE TO GO BOTH WAYS. OKAY? > > OKAY WITH ME. NEXT WE HAVE AWARD WINNING ACTOR AND AUTHOR ETHAN HAWK LIVE VIA HIDDEN CAMERA. > > SOMEONE LEAVE THEIR PHONE IN HERE? IS THIS THING ON? > > AND IT LOOKS LIKE WE'VE BEEN CAUGHT. > > COLBERT, IS THAT YOU? > > HERE TO COUNT VOTES, WE'VE GOT THE TOOTSIE POP OWL. HOW MANY VOTES? > > ONE, TWO, THREE. > > SO THREE? > > NO, DUMMY, 270. DO YOU HAVE ANOTHER LOLLIPOP. > > NEXT WE HAVE ACTOR AND ACTIVIST GEORGE TIKA. > > PERSONALLY, I'M INTERESTED IN THE SWING STATES OF OHIO AND MICHIGAN OR, AS THEY'RE KNOWN BY THEIR POSTAL CODES, OH MI. > > AND WE HAVE SOMEONE IN A CIA WIG TO TALK ABOUT THE YOUTH VOTE, FIVE TEENAGERS EITHER NAMED JOE OR RONALD. > > MY NAME IS DONALD. > > CLOSE ENOUGH. PANEL, WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT THE NIGHT SO FAR? > > WHAT? AND I'M BEING TOLD THAT'S ALL WE HAVE TIME FOR. > > THIS HAS BEEN STEPHEN COLBERT'S SHOWTIME ELECTION SPECIAL PRESENTS. > > WAIT A MINUTE. WAIT A MINUTE, STEPHEN. I'VE GOT A UNIQUE HISTORICAL PERSPEC PERSPECTIVE. > > OKAY. THIS IS HIGHLY UNUSUAL, BUT GO AHEAD. > > DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH PEOPLE HAVE WASTED ON HOTELS EVERY YEAR? THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH YOU WOULD SAVE IF YOU HAD A TIMESHARE IN BEAUTIFUL KEY WEST. > > NO, DORIS. I'M NOT BUYING A TIMESHARE FROM YOU AGAIN. FOOL ME TWICE, SHAME ON ME. ALL RIGHT. WHERE ARE WE RIGHT NOW? THANK YOU TO THE WHOLE PANEL. THAT WAS SO GOOD. WHERE ARE WE RIGHT NOW? WHAT ARE WE DOING? ALL RIGHT. IT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE FOR TONIGHT. LET'S CHECK IN WITH OUR FRIEND AND YOURS, MR. JOHN BAPTIST. JOHN, GOOD TO SEE YOU. THANK YOU FOR WEARING A SUIT. THANK YOU FOR WEARING A SUIT. YOU SHOULD SEE WHAT THE OTHER PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM ARE WEARING. > > OH, REALLY? I'M GETTING JOY FROM EVY. THE LAUGH IS REALLY INFECTIOUS. > > YES. SHE'S MY LIFEBOAT. JOHN, HOW ARE YOU DOING TONIGHT? WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND? > > I THINK TODAY SHOULD BE A NATIONAL HOLIDAY. THAT'S WHY I GOT MY SUIT ON. IT IS AN IMPORTANT DAY. I WAS PLAYING FOR THE PEOPLE IN PHILLY, AND I'M JUST -- I'M HOPING FOR THE BEST, AND I BELIEVE WE WILL GET IT. > > HOW LONG WERE YOU OUT THERE PLAYING? > > OH, I WAS OUT THERE PLAYING FOR A GOOD TWO HOURS, AND WE BROUGHT JOY TO THE POLLS, AND THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO BRING THROUGHOUT THE REST OF THIS SEASON AS WE GET A NEW ADMINISTRATION, HOPEFULLY, AND THAT'S WHAT WE DOING. > > WERE THERE LONG LINES? DID YOU SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE DOWN THERE? > > YOU KNOW, IT WASN'T AS LONG AS I WAS HOPING IT WOULD BE. BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE VOTED EARLY. > > YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO GO WITH, TOO. I'M GOING TO BE A LOT OF PEOPLE VOTED EARLY. DO WE KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT PENNSYLVANIA. PENNSYLVANIA HAS NOT BEEN CALLED SO YOU MIGHT HAVE PUSHED IT OVER THE TOP WITH PIANO. WE'RE GOING TO BREAK INTO CBS NEWS. WOULD YOU GIVE ME 15 SECONDS OF JOY? > > OH, I GOT YOU. > > THANK YOU, JOHN. JOHN BAPTIST, EVERYBODY. AND ARE WE THERE? ARE WE READY TO GO? I'M BEING TOLD IT IS TIME TO CHECK IN WITH OUR FRIENDS OVER AT CBS NEWS. WE'RE ON SHOWTIME RIGHT NOW, BUT THEY HAVE MY OLD TIME SLOT FOR THE NIGHT. LET'S SEE HOW IT'S GOING. JUST DOWN THE STREET FROM US, ARE WE READY TO ROLL AT THIS POINT? WE'RE TEN SECONDS AWAY. WHAT? KANSAS WENT TO TRUMP. SUCK ON THAT FOR TEN SECONDS. > > 2020 AMERICA DECIDES. WE ARE WATCHING IT ALL UNFOLD HERE AT CBS NEWS ELECTION HEADQUARTERS IN TIME SQUARE. LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE BIG MAP TO SEE WHERE WE STAND AT THIS HOUR. MANY OF THE BATTLEGROUND STATES ARE STILL TOSS-UPS. CBS NEWS CHARACTERIZES FLORIDA AS LEANING TOWARD PRESIDENT TRUMP. IN THE ELECTORAL VOTE JOE BIDEN LEADS 168-111. AND ARIZONA AT THIS HOUR LEANS TOWARDS FORMER VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN. WE KNOW THE WORLD IS WATCHING TONIGHT AND STEPHEN COLBERT IS HARD AT WORK WITH A LIVE SHOW ON OUR SISTER NETWORK SHOWTIME. > > I JUST LOST HER. > > WHOA, WHOA. HI! HI, STEPHEN. HOW ARE YOU? THERE HE IS. > > SORRY. I LOST YOU FOR A SECOND THERE. I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING. > > WELL, LOOK -- > > HEY, THERE YOU ARE. > > HEY! > > HEY! > > HEY, STEPHEN COLBERT. > > WE'RE ACTUALLY SO CLOSE IN MANHAT MANHATTAN, WE SHOULD JUST OPEN UP THE WINDOWS AND SHOUT AT EACH OTHER. > > OVER THE SIRENS. HOW ARE YOU? > > I'M FINE. I'M FINE. YOU KNOW, I'M GLAD TO CHECK IN WITH SOMEBODY WHO ACTUALLY KNOWS SOMETHING. I'M SEALED OVER AT THE OFFICES OF THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER AND WE'RE MAKING UP WHAT WE KNOW. ALL OF OUR INFORMATION JUST COMES FROM YOU. CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON? > > WELL, JOHN DICKERSON IS HERE, AND WE'VE GOT OUR NOTABLE NINE STATES THAT WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING IN THE BATTLEGROUND STATES. JUST TWO OF THEM WE'VE GOT LEANING A CERTAIN WAY, RIGHT? FLORIDA WE'VE GOT LEANING TOWARDS TRUMP. AND ARIZONA LEANING TOWARDS BIDEN. > > JOE BIDEN. > > THAT'S RIGHT. SO FLORIDA LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING HIS WAY. NORTH CAROLINA AND GEORGIA, WHICH WERE AT THE EDGE OF DEMOCRATIC DREAMS. THEY HAD FANTASIES ABOUT PICKING UP ONE OF THOSE TWO STATES. IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT'S GOING THAT WAY FOR JOE BIDEN. THE OTHER ROUTE FOR JOE BIDEN TO TAKE STATES AWAY FROM DONALD TRUMP IS TO GO UP THROUGH THE MIDWEST. THE CHALLENGE OF THE MIDWEST AND BASICALLY THE NIGHT HAS BEEN BETWEEN EARLY VOTE AND WHO SHOWED UP ON ELECTION DAY. THE BIDEN FORCES VOTED EARLY. THE TRUMP FORCES HAVE SHOWN UP ON ELECTION DAY. MIDWEST, THAT'S PART OF THE STORY, BUT THE OTHER PART OF THE STORY IS IT'S GOING TO TAKE THEM A LONG TIME TO COUNT THE VOTES. > > CAN WE SAY THIS? WHEN THE EVENING STARTED, WE STARTED AT 7:00 EASTERN TIME AND BOTH CANDIDATES WERE VERY CONFIDENT THEY WERE GOING TO WIN. AS WE SIT HERE TONIGHT, THEY'RE STILL VERY CONFIDENT THAT THEY'RE GOING TO WIN. > > SOMETHING WOULD HAVE CHANGED FROM THE LAST TIME TO THIS TIME. FOUR YEARS AGO, WE'RE DOWN TO THOSE IN MIDWEST EARN INDUSTRIAL DATES AGAIN, JOHN. IS THAT THE CASE? > > NORA MENTIONED THIS, THAT WE HAVE ARIZONA AS LEANING TOWARD JOE BIDEN, SO THAT WOULD BE A BIG DEAL FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS. ONE, IT IS FROM THAT LIST OF STATES DONALD TRUMP WON IN 2016 AND DEMOCRATS HOPE THAT THAT IS PART OF THE STORY IN STATES LIKE ARIZONA AND MAYBE OTHER PIECES. THAT'S THE BRIGHT PIECE OF NEWS FOR DEMOCRATS SO FAR TONIGHT. > > JUST TO POINT THAT OUT, WHY ARIZONA IS SO IMPORTANT IF IN FACT BIDEN CARRIES THAT STATE, IT IS ONE OF THEIR KEY PATHWAYS TO THE PRESIDENCY. THEY WANT TO WIN ARIZONA, MICHIGAN AND WISCONSIN, AND THEY COULD WIN WITHOUT PENNSYLVANIA AND FLORIDA IN THAT PARTICULAR SCENARIO. SO ARIZONA HAS ALWAYS BEEN SORT OF, I GUESS YOU WOULD CALL IT A SAFETY, AN EXTRA IF THEY DID NOT WIN PENN PN AND FLORIDA. BUT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS WHETHER WE'LL BE ABLE TO CHARACTERIZE WHO MAY WIN IF THIS GOES DOWN TO THE UPPER MIDWEST. AS YOU KNOW, IT'S GOING TO TAKE A WHILE TO COUNT THE VOTES THERE. > > WAIT. DID I HEAR THIS RIGHT, THAT IT'S POSSIBLE THAT JOE BIDEN WOULD NOT WIN HIS HOME STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA? > > WE DON'T KNOW THAT YET. WE JUST DON'T KNOW. MARGARET BRENNAN WAS SAYING EARLIER THEY STARTED THE VOTE COUNTING AGAIN IN PHILADELPHIA. THEY PAUSED IT FOR A LITTLE WHILE. IT WAS A LABOR ISSUE. BUT HE DOES HAVE A SCENARIO WHERE JOE BIDEN COULD WIN THE PRESIDENCY WITHOUT PENNSYLVANIA OR FLORIDA. > > BUT IT WOULD STING. IT WOULD STING. IT WOULD BE LIKE YOUR MOM SAYING YOU LOOK FUNNY. > > WELL AS SOMEONE WHOSE MOM SAID THAT TO THEM ALL THE TIME, JOE BIDEN 99% OF THE VOTE IN, IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S GOT IT BY NINE POINTS, WHICH BEATS HILLARY CLINTON IN THAT SMALL COUNTY. AT LEAST IN THAT REGARD, HE CAN FEEL LIKE HE WON. > > IT'S LIKE YOUR MOM SAYING, YOU KNOW, I NEVER LIKED YOU. I ALWAYS LIKED YOUR BROTHER BETTER. > > JOHN, DID YOUR MOM EVER SAY THAT TO YOU? I HAVE A VERY CHARMING BROTHER. > > GALE, YOU HAVE GOT TO BE UP FOR CTM. > > I KNOW. THIS IS ME ON DRUGS. > > THAT SEEMS LIKE A GOOD TIME TO BOW OUT. > > AND MY DRUGS I MEAN WATER. BUT, NO, WE WANT TO STAY HERE FOR AS LONG AS IT TAKES. YOU DON'T WANT TO STAY HERE AND LEAVE AS THEY'RE SAYING, WE'RE GOING TO KNOW SOMETHING. BUT IN ALL HONESTY, IT DOESN'T KNOW LIKE WE'RE GOING TO KNOW ANYTHING FOR SURE THIS EVENING. > > THAT'S A CBS NEWS PROMISE. WE WON'T KNOW ANYTHING. STICK AROUND. THANKS SO MUCH, YOU GUYS! THANKS FOR ADDING LEGITIMACY TO MY NIGHT. > > TAKE THAT BACK! > > THANK YOU, STEPHEN. WE APPRECIATE IT. > > WE USED TO LIKE YOU. > > THANK YOU, GALE. THANK YOU, NORA. JOHN. > > JOHN. > > THERE YOU GO. NICE PEOPLE. THEY'RE SUCH NICE PEOPLE. AM I STILL OVER HERE, OR AM I OVER HERE NOW? WHAT AM I DOING? AM I DOING MORE OF THESE OR AM I MOVING ON TO SOMETHING ELSE? DOING THE SENATE. OH, THIS IS BIG. ARE YOU PREPARED FOR THE SENATE. TAKE A SWIG OF WINE. THEY GAVE HER SOME WINE. HOLD IT IN YOUR HAND. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I'M GOING TO READ, SO I WANT YOU TO BE WELL GUARDED. OKAY? I'M WEARING A CUP. OKAY. OF COURSE TONIGHT THERE ARE ALSO SOME NON-TRUMP STAKES. AND BY THE WAY, IF YOU ARE HAVING STEAK, MAKE IT A NONTRUMP STEAKS. ONE OF THE STAKES IS BALANCE OF CONTROL OF THE ELECTION. THE DEMOCRATS HOLD 47 SEATS. THE DEMOCRATS NEED TO PICK UP 4 SEATS TO TAKE CONTROL. SO LOOKING OVER AT THE UNITED STATES SENATE AT THIS HOUR, IT REMAINS A BUILDING IN WASHINGTON, D.C. AS FOR WHO IS GOING TO BE WORKING INSIDE THAT BUILDING NEXT YEAR, DO WE ACTUALLY HAVE THE INFORMATION OR IS IT ALL JUST PREAMBLE? NEW HAMPSHIRE HAS DEFEATED THE REPUBLICAN. AND THE 231 YEAR STREAK OF NO CORKYS IN CONGRESS CONTINUES. THE MASSACHUSETTS SENATE RACE HAS BEEN CALLED FOR SENATOR ED MARKEY, WHO IS THE INCUMBENT AND CO-AUTHOR OF THE NEW GREEN DEAL. IT IS FITTING THAT MASSACHUSETTS HAS DECIDED TO REUSE HIM. OKLAHOMA SENATE RACE HAS BEEN CALLED FOR GOP INCUMBENT AND GLOBAL WARMING DENIER JIM INHOFF WHO WAS HEAVILY FAVORED TO HIM. HE WASN'T SUITING THE OUTCOME. HE WAS SWEATING BECAUSE EVERY YEAR IT'S WARMER THAN THE PREVIOUS ONE. IN THE SENATE RACE FOR THE TENNESSEE SENATE SEAT HELD TO REPLACE THE RETIRING LA RAR ALEXANDER, BILL HAGGERTY HAS DEFEATED BRADSHAW WHO HAD THE ENDORSEMENT OF JOHNNY KNOXVILLE. NOW THAT SHE'S DEFEATED, SHE WILL BE STUFFED IN A SHOPPING CART AND ROLLED THROUGH A CAR WASH. SHELLY MOORE HAS DEFEATED PAULA JEAN SWEARINGIN WHO WON'T BE SWEARING IN. AND THIS IS A BIG ONE. THIS IS AN ACTUAL BIG ONE WITH A GREEN CHECK NEXT TO IT, RIGHT? OUT IN COLORADO, SENATOR COREY GARDENER HAS LOST TO DEMOCRATIC CHALLENGER JOHN HECKENLOOPER. HE WAS IS MAYOR OF DENVER COLORADO, FOUNDER OF THE THE FIRST BREW CUP AND CREATOR AND STAR OF THE SHOW HECKENLOOPER. IN ALABAMA, REPUBLICAN TOM MI TY THE UPP UPP UPPERVILLE HAS UNSEATED DOUG JONES. DOUG JONES LOST TO TOMMY TUBERVILLE. DO I SWITCH CAMERAS? DO I STAY HERE. I STAY RIGHT HERE AND WE JUST DRIVE THE TRAIN, RIGHT? JUST KEEP DRIVING THE TRAIN. SPEAKING OF KNOWING THINGS, I'VE PUT MY PHONE ON MUTE SO I DON'T KNOW THINGS. THE ONE THING WE DO KNOW IS THAT DONALD TRUMP IS DEFINITELY GOING TO LOSE BLACK VOTERS TONIGHT. HERE WITH HIS THOUGHTS ON WHY IT I IS. > > WHAT'S HAPPENING? > > NOT MUCH. ELECTION. YOU ARE NO STRANGER TO ELECTION NIGHT SPECIALS. IN 2016 YOU WERE ON THIS SHOW WHEN TRUMP WON. AND YOU SAID THIS. > > CONGRATULATIONS, AMERICA. YOU FUCKED THIS ONE UP. > > SOMEBODY WAS RIGHT. THAT WAS ME. > > THAT WAS TRUE. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT. THERE ARE NO COMMERCIAL BREAKS HERE SO WHILE I GO CHECK OUT WHAT NEXT IS COMING DOWN THE PIPE FOR THE ELECTION, WHY DON'T YOU TAKE A MINUTE TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THAT FUCK UP FROM FOUR YEARS AGO MEANT FOR ALL OF US, AND I'LL BE BACK IN JUST A MINUTE. IT'S YOURS, BUDDY. > > THANK YOU, STEPHEN. GOT TO MAKE SURE HE'S REALLY DONE, THOUGH. ONLY ONE WAY TO FIND OUT. LORD OF THE RINGS SUCKS! OH, YEAH. HE'S REALLY GONE. HELLO, AMERICA. DID YOU NOT HEAR ME THE FIRST TIME? LET ME REMIND YOU HOW TRUMP SOLD HIMSELF TO BLACK VOTERS IN 2016. PAY ATTENTION, PLEASE. > > WHAT THE HELL DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE? TO THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY, I SAY, WHAT THE HELL DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE? VOTE FOR ME. WHAT THE HELL DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE? > > WELL, IT TURNS OUT A LOT. OKAY? IN FACT, I MADE A LIST. > > LIST OF THINGS WE HAD TO LOSE. > > NUMBER ONE, VOTING RIGHTS. I'M TALKING VOTER ID LAWS, PERJING VOTER ROLLS, LONG LINES AND PREDOMINANTLY BLACK DISTRICTS IN GEORGIA SOME VOTERS EXPERIENCED WAIT TIMES OF UP TO FIVE HOURS. MEANWHILE, FOR ONE WHITE LADY, THEY PUT A BALLOT BOX ON THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. AT THIS POINT, YOU COULD GO BACK TO SCHOOL, GET A DEGREE, GO THROUGH ASTRONAUT TRAINING AND STILL VOTE FASTER THAN A BROTHER IN MA CON. TRUMP HAS BEEN EVERYTHING HE CAN TO UNDERMINE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. OF COURSE HE DISLIKES OBAMACARE. IT IS A COMBO OF THE TWO THINGS HE HATES THE MOST: OBAMA AND CARING. NUMBER THREE, CHADWICK BOSEMAN. THAT'S RIGHT. I'M BLAMING TRUMP FOR THAT. HE COULD TAKE THE BLAME FOR THE DEATH OF THE BLACK PANTHER. ALSO, I'M HOLDING HIM PERSONALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE LOSS OF ARETHA FRANKLIN AND KANYE WEST. I MEAN, KANYE DIDN'T DIE, BUT HE IS CERTAINLY LOST. SPEAKING OF DYING, ANOTHER THING WE LOST, OUR FUCKING LIVES. THERE IS STILL A PANDEMIC GOING ON. FUN FACT, BLACK PEOPLE ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BY CORONAVIRUS. THIS IS SO TYPICAL. WHEN AMERICA GETS A COLD, BLACK PEOPLE GET CORONAVIRUS, THEN AMERICA TAKES AWAY THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE. YOU KNOW WHO SAID THAT? ME. IT WAS ME. ALL RIGHT. A BLACK PERSON CAN'T QUOTE THEMSELVES. TELL ME WHAT ELSE AM I NOT ALLOWED TO DO, YOU RACIST. NUMBER TEN, MOVIES. UNDER TRUMP, THEY GAVE THE OSCAR TO "GREEN BOOK." DO YOU KNOW HOW BLACK PEOPLE FELT ABOUT GREEN BOOK? ME NEITHER. WE DIDN'T WATCH. BUT IT IS NO SURPRISE. AMERICA HAS ALWAYS IGNORED BLACK PEOPLE IN FAVOR OF GREEN. AND FINALLY, NUMBER 11, MY TIME. SEE, I SUPPORT BLACK LIVES MATTER. BUT ALL THAT MARCHING TAKES TIME. ONCE WE'RE FINISHING CONVINCING WHITE AMERICA WE ARE INDEED HUMAN BEINGS, IT WOULD BE NICE TO DO THINGS HUMAN BEINGS ENJOY LIKE JOGGING, THROWING A BARBECUE OR GOING BIRD WATCHING WITHOUT SOME NUT ASS KAREN CALLING THE COPS. > > LIST OF THINGS WE STILL HAVE TO LOSE. NUMBER ONE, ALL THE SHITI JUST SAID BECAUSE AS BAD AS IT IS, IT CAN ALWAYS GET WORSE. TRUMP APPOINTED THREE SUPREME COURT JUSTICES. AND THE REPUBLICANS JUST GOT THE LAST INFINITY STONE THEY NEED TO TAKE AWAY EVERYTHING WE FOUGHT WAR. WE'RE ONE STEP AWAY FROM GREEN BOOK 2. TOO GREEN, TOO BOOK. SPORTS. DO YOU THINK TRUMP IS GOING TO STOP AT KAEPERNICK? IN FOUR YEARS, IT WILL BE A CAME OF HORSE BETWEEN J.J. REDDICK AND LUKA DONCIC. THIS ONE ISN'T SOMETHING THAT BLACK PEOPLE HAVE TO LOSE, IT IS SOMETHING WE ALL HAVE TO LOSE. OUR SOUL. BLACK PEOPLE HAVE LONG BEEN THE SOUL OF THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE WE HAVE TO BELIEVE IN THE PROMISE OF EQUALITY AND JUSTICE THAT AMERICA PROVIDES. JUST LIKE A BELIEF IN A HIGHER POWER, FOR BLACK PEOPLE, AMERICA'S PROMISE IS SOMETHING THAT IS NOT VISIBLE, BUT WE HAVE FAITH IN THAT PROMISE. AND THAT FAITH IS A MOTTO FOR ALL AMERICANS. SO WE WILL CONTINUE TO SHOUT AND DEMAND TO BE TREATED EQUALLY IN THIS COUNTRY, BUT WE CAN'T DO IT FOREVER. AND IF AMERICA LOSES ITS SOUL, LORD HAVE MERCY, IT'S GAME OVER. THE LAND WILL STILL EXIST, BUT THE NOBLE HUMAN EXPERIENCE, THAT'S A WRAP. BUT I'M SURE IT WILL BE HEALED BY THE RELEASE OF "GREEN BOOK 3." TRUST ME, IT CAN AND SHOULD NOT HAPPEN. OKAY. I'M BACK. I DIDN'T CATCH ALL OF YOUR PIECE, BUT DID YOU SAY THERE IS A NEW "GREEN BOOK"? I LOVE THAT MOVIE. > > THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME, STEPHEN. ALWAYS A PLEASURE. > > SEE YOU A LITTLE BIT LATER. ARE WE READY TO GO ON? WHAT ARE WE DOING NOW? IS THIS ELECTROMAP? WE'RE DOING THE CIRCUS FIRST. I THOUGHT I WAS DOING THAT BEFORE. YES. DON'T SAY THE WORD VAMP. THAT SOUNDS LIKE WE DON'T HAVE A PLAN. JOINING -- WE DON'T HAVE PLAN, BUT DON'T SAY IT. WE'RE PROFESSIONALS, GODDAMNIT. JOINING ME BACK TO THE LATE SHOW, MARK McKINNON AND JOHN HILEMAN. I REALIZE WE REALLY JUST BOOKED YOUR HAT. OH, LADY AND GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. WELCOME BACK. GOOD TO SEE ALL OF YOU AGAIN. YOU WERE HERE IN 2016 WHEN THIS WHOLE DIRTY, DIRTY BUSINESS STARTED. ARE YOU HAVING ANY FLASH BACKS? > > WHEN YOU'RE SAYING I WAS HERE, WHAT DO YOU MEAN EXACTLY BY HERE? > > YOU WERE ON OUR SHOWTIME SPECIAL. WE'RE ALL ON TV RIGHT NOW ON SHOWTIME. > > WE ARE. THIS FEELS LIKE SOME VIRTUALLY SPACE. I FELT LIKE I WAS PHYSICALLY IN YOUR PRESENCE ON ELECTION NIGHT. > > I HAD AN OUT OF BODY EXPERIENCE ON ELECTION NIGHT. I WASN'T IN MY OWN PRESENCE ON ELECTION NIGHT FOUR YEARS AGO. > > I RECALL THAT. YOU DID NOT HAVE FUN ON THAT NIGHT. > > AND YOU KICKING UP YOUR HEELS AND WHISTLING A HAPPY TUNE. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? > > I WOULD SAY THAT FLASH BACKS ARE NOT AN UNCOMMON OCCURRENCE FOR ME IN GENERAL, BUT THE FLASHBACKS I HAVE FROM THAT NIGHT ARE PARTICULARLY UNPLEASANT. > > WHERE ARE YOU ALL RIGHT NOW IN THE WORLD. IS THIS LIKE THE STATE OF THE UNION, YOU HAVE TO BE IN DIFFERENT LOCATIONS TO KEEP THE CHAIN OF CIRCUIT COMMAND GOING IN CASE SOMETHING HAPPENS. > > BECAUSE OF COVID, WE HAVE ACTUALLY NEVER EVEN SEEN EACH OTHER DURING THIS WHOLE RUN, BUT ALSO WE WANT TO COVER THE COUNTRY, AND WE HAVE 13 DIFFERENT PLACES RIGHT NOW. I'M IN WASHINGTON, D.C. ALEX, WHERE ARE YOU? > > I'M CONTRACTUALLY OBLIGATED TO BE IN HELL. I'M ACTUALLY IN PENNSYLVANIA, WHICH IS ONE OF THE SWINGIEST PARTS OF A VERY SWING STATE THAT EVERYBODY IS OBSESSED WITH, AND IT LOOKS LIKE I WILL BE HERE UNTIL 2021. > > ALEX THINKS SHE'S IN HELL. I'M IN ST. PETERSBURG, FLORIDA, MAN. YOU ARE IN LIKE PARADISE COMPARED TO ME, WAGNER. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? YOU ARE NUTS. > > HE DOESN'T GET TO LEAVE AND THERE IS HUMIDITY. I THINK HE WINS THIS CONTEST. > > CORRECT. > > LET ME ASK YOU. 100 MILLION VOTES WERE CAST BEFORE WE EVEN OPENED THE POLLS OKAY. WHO CAN YOU TELL SO FAR BENEFITTED FROM THAT? THEY SAID BIDEN, BUT IS THAT PLAYING OUT? > > I THINK SO. I MEAN, I THINK WHEN WE HAVE -- IN STATES WHERE YOU ARE ALLOWED TO TOUCH THOSE MAIL-IN BALLOTS AND OPEN THEM AND TABULATE THEM BEFORE ELECTION DAY, THE EARLY VOTES ARE SWINGING TOWARDS BIDEN. IN MICHIGAN, WISCONSIN AND PENNSYLVANIA, IT'S GOING TO BE SLOW DOING AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO KNOW EXACTLY, BUT THE EXPECTATION IS THAT IT'S GOING TO BENEFIT BIDEN. > > MARK, DOES THIS FEEL ANY DIFFERENT TO YOU THIS TIME AROUND? IT FEELS A LITTLE DIFFERENT TO ME BECAUSE LAST TIME I HAD AN AUDIENCE AND I WASN'T BROADCASTING FROM A STORAGE ROOM PRETENDING IT WAS AN OFFICE. WHAT FEELS DIFFERENT ABOUT YOU, ABOUT THIS TO YOU? > > I'LL TELL YOU, WHAT'S STRANGE TO ME IS HOW MUCH IT FEELS LIKE 2016 ALL OF A SUDDEN. I THINK FOR A WHILE -- I THINK FOR A WHILE PEOPLE GOT DISTRACTED FROM WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON HERE. A YEAR AGO WHEN DEMOCRATS WERE STRIKE THAT SAYING WHAT THEY NEEDED TO DO, THEY NEEDED TO WIN BACK THE BLUE WALL PERIOD. SUDDENLY PEOPLE STARTED TALKING ABOUT GEORGIA AND NORTH CAROLINA AND FLORIDA. IT WAS ALL THE FEVER DREAM, AND IT'S COMING BACK TO EXACTLY WHAT WE -- YOU KNOW, WHAT PEOPLE THOUGHT A YEAR AGO, WHICH IS IT'S GOING TO COME DOWN TO WHERE ALEX IS AND WISCONSIN AND MICHIGAN AND MAYBE ARIZONA. > > ISN'T THAT -- ISN'T THAT WHY THE DEMOCRATS WENT WITH JOE BIDEN, REALLY, IS BECAUSE HE IS THAT RUST BELT GUY? > > YEAH. HE'S SCRANTON JOE. HE STARTED HIS CAMPAIGN IN PITTSBURGH. HE ENDED IT IN PITTSBURGH. THIS IS THE SORT OF DNA OF BIDEN'S CAMPAIGN. THIS IS WHY HE'S AT THE TOP OF THE TICKET AND NOW WE ARE SEEING IT BEING BORN OUT IN THE ELECTION ITSELF. > > JOHN, YOU WERE ON THE SHOW BEING INTERVIEWED BY ME WHEN FLORIDA WAS CALLED FOUR YEARS AGO. THAT WAS A REMARKABLE -- THAT WAS A REMARKABLE MOMENT. > > YES. > > WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON DOWN THERE? WHAT'S IT LOOK LIKE THIS TIME? FOUR YEARS LATER, WITH EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED, THE LAST THING I SAW THAT TRUMP WAS LEADING BY MORE THAN HE WON LAST TIME. > > YEAH. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY, STEPHEN, FLORIDA IS GONNA FLORIDA. THAT'S THE THING. IT'S A MESS DOWN HERE. AND, YOU KNOW, I'M IN PINELAS COUNTY. THIS COUNTY THAT WHOEVER WINS THIS COUNTRY, A LOT OF SENIOR CITIZENS HERE, INDEPENDENT SENIOR CITIZENS. THEY GO BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE PARTIES, WHOEVER WINS THIS COUNTY WINS FLORIDA. THAT'S HISTORICALLY BEEN TRUE THROUGHOUT OUR LIFETIME WITH THE EXCEPTION OF AL GORE. ALTHOUGH SOME ARGUE THAT WAS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF SOMEONE THAT WON PINELAS COUNTY AND WON FLORIDA. JOE BIDEN WON PINELAS COUNTY AND THEN DONALD TRUMP CRUSHED HIM IN THE REST OF THE STATE. FOR THE SIX CORE BATTLEGROUND STATES THAT BOTH CAMPAIGNS FOUGHT IN FOR A YEAR, THIS WAS THE ONE THAT PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT TRUMP HAD THE ENGINE MOSTLY OF THE CORE SIX. THIS IS THE ONE THAT WAS CONSIDERED STRONGEST FOR TRUMP. IT IS HIS ADOPTIVE HOME. PEOPLE WERE MORE SURPRISED IN 2016, PEOPLE WERE GENERALLY MORE SURPRISED THAT TRUMP COULD BE PRESIDENT IN 2016 AND FLORIDA WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A PLACE THAT HILLARY CLINTON HAD LOCKED UP. SO WE WERE ALL STUNNED ON THE AIR WITH YOU NIGHT. I REMEMBER YOUR AUDIENCE CRY IN. BUT THIS TIME AROUND I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE HAD THE EXPECTATION THAT THIS WAS A PLACE TRUMP WOULD WIN, SO IT CAME AS LESS OF A SURPRISE TO PEOPLE TONIGHT THAT TRUMP IS GOING TO WIN HERE. YOU KNOW, IT'S KIND OF LIKE A CARPET BAGGER HERE, RIGHT. HE'S GOT A COUPLE GOLF COURSES HERE. PEOPLE LIKE HIM. > > BUT HE CRUSHED IN MIAMI DADE. CUBAN AMERICANS, VENEZUELANS. MAN, BIDEN IS A SOCIALIST MESSAGE REALLY, REALLY PUNCHED HIS LIGHTS OUT. > > YES. IT IS SURPRISING IN THE SENSE THAT ONE OF THE STRENGTHS WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN, AND I HAVEN'T SEEN ALL THE DEMOGRAPHIC DATA, BUT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN REPERFORMED BETTER WITH SENIOR CITIZENS THAN TRUMP. HE'S PERFORMED PRETTY WELL WITH SENIORS HERE. BUT TO MARK'S POINT WHAT TRUMP HAS DONE IN FLORIDA IS USE THAT SOCIALISM MESSAGE AND SOME OF THE LAW AND ORDER STUFF TO PENETRATE WITH THE LATINO VOTE TO A POINT A LOT OF LIBERALS COULD UNDERSTAND. > > ALEX, I WANT TO -- YOU'RE IN PENNSYLVANIA. AS YOU SAID, YOU'RE GOING TO BE THERE UNTIL THE SUNBURNS OUT TO A CINDER. AND EXPLAIN TO ME AND THE AUDIENCE WHY THAT IS. WHAT IS DIFFICULT ABOUT COUNTING THE VOTES IN PENNSYLVANIA? WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH TERRIBLE RECOUNTS IN THE PATHS. WHAT IS THE ORDER IN WHICH THESE VOTES WILL BE TALLIED? IS THERE A PROBLEM WITH THAT? > > YEAH. WELL, SO, THEY HAVE A DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR AND A REPUBLICAN STATE LEGISLATURE. AND IT BASICALLY ENSURED THAT MAIL-IN BALLOTS CANNOT BE TOUCHED BEFORE ELECTION DAY. THEY COULD OPEN THEM AT 7:00 P. A.M., BUT THEY COULDN'T START COUNTING THEM UNTIL THE POLLS CLOSED. IT'S ROOMS OF PEOPLE OPENING UP ENVELOPES, UNFOLDING THE BALLOTS AND COUNTING THEM. AS OF RIGHT NOW, AS OF THIS HOUR, THEY HAD OPENED ABOUT HALF OF THE MAIL-IN BALLOTS THEY HAD RECEIVED AND COUNTED ABOUT ONE-EIGHTHS OF THEM. THEY THINK IT WILL TAKE SEVERAL DAYS. AND THAT'S WORKING VERY FAST. THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WORKING FAST, EATING COOKIES, ANYTHING TO FUEL THEM THROUGH THE PROCESS. > > ARE THOSE MAIL-INS EXPECTED TO GO TRUMP'S WAY OR BIDEN'S WAY? > > BIDEN'S WAY. > > BIDEN'S WAY, OKAY. > > BROADLY IS THAT THE MAIL-IN BALLOTS FAVOR DEMOCRATS. SO ONE OF THE REASONS EVERYBODY NEEDS TO SIMMER DOWN AND HOLD ON IS BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF MAIL-IN BALLOTS IN WISCONSIN, MICHIGAN AND PENNSYLVANIA. MORE IN MICHIGAN THAN ANYWHERE ELSE. PENNSYLVANIA IS ABOUT 45%, 40% OF THE STATE IS MAIL-IN BALLOTS AND IT WILL TAKE TIME TO COUNT THEM AND NONE OF THOSE BALLOTS COULD HAVE BEEN COUNTED BEFORE ELECTION DAY. NOW THAT WE'RE DOWN TO THOSE THREE DASTATES, WE HAVE TO WAIT > > NOT CLEAR THAT DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO WAIT, THOUGH. THAT'S THE QUESTION. 154. WE HAVEN'T HAD TRUMP MAKE A SPEECH YET CLAIMING VICTORY. > > WE PROMISED THAT IF EITHER CANDIDATES GIVE A SPEECH, WE WILL NOT GO TO IT. NOTHING HAS HAPPENED YET? > > SOUND EDITORIAL JUDGMENT. > > WHAT ABOUT THE SENATE? DO THE DEMOCRATS STILL HAVE A SHOT AT FLIPPING THAT? LET'S SAY BIDEN WINS. DO THEY GET THOSE THREE SEATS THEY NEED? > > COME ON. GROW A PAIR. YOU'RE NOT SWORN IN. > > WELL, RIGHT NOW IT'S NETSO ZERO. WE DON'T KNOW. > > WHEN DO YOU THINK WE WILL KNOW WHO THE PRESIDENT IS? > > THURSDAY. > > THERE IT IS. IT'S THURSDAY, EVERYBODY. THE ONLY PERSON ON THIS PHONE CALL WILLING TO TAKE A STAND. > > I WILL SAY TO YOUR POINT THAT IT LOOKS INCREASINGLY LIKE REPUBLICANS MAY HOLD THE SENATE. > > ALL RIGHT. THERE IT IS. WELL, ALEX WAGNER, JOHN AND MARK, THANK YOU SO MUCH. AN HONOR TO SHARE THE SHOWTIME WITH YOU AGAIN. STAY SAFE. STAY STERILE. > > AS SOON AS NIGERIA COMES IN, WE'LL HAVE A FINAL COUNT. > > THAT WAS A GREAT PARADE MONDAY. THAT WAS A GREAT RALLY. BYE, GUYS! LET'S PUT UP THE ELECTORAL MAP AND BREAK THIS DOWN. SO THIS IS THE ELECTORAL MAP. CAN WE GET A SHOT OF THIS? CAN WE ROBO OVER? THIS IS THE ELECTORAL MAP RIGHT NOW. AT FIRST FLUSH IT LOOKS A LOT LIKE A MAP BECAUSE TECHNICALLY THAT'S WHAT IT IS. THEY MOVED IT TO ARIZONA. I WAS AGAINST IT. LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT NEBRASKA. SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH NEBRASKA SECOND. LET ME JUST -- THAT'S BROKEN. THAT'S BROKEN. LET'S MOVE ON. ANYWAY, THAT'S A MAP. THAT'S WHAT MAPS LOOK LIKE, IN CASE YOU ARE WONDERING. LOOK AT THESE BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE. ARE WE READY TO GO? I WANT TO WARN OUR AFFILIATES WE'RE GOING TO GO LONG. LET'S FIND OUT. HOW ARE YOU DOING OVER THERE, HONEY? YOU DON'T HAVE AN EAR PIECE. YOU DIDN'T HEAR WHAT THE GUYS ON "THE CIRCUS" HAD TO STAY. HELLO, YOU THREE BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE. HOW ARE YOU? > > ASK ME THAT IN THE MORNING. > > YOU GUYS, I'M VERY HAPPY THAT YOU ARE HERE, BUT I HAVE TO TALK WITH THESE GUYS FOR A SECOND BECAUSE THEY WERE HERE FOUR YEARS AGO. HOW DOES THIS FEEL COMPARED TO FOUR YEARS AGO? HOW WOULD YOU STACK IT UP? > > I HAVE AGED MANY DECADES IN THE PAST FOUR YEARS, SO I'M TRYING TO BE OPTIMISTIC. TONIGHT ON THE BRIGHT SIDE IT IS A BIG NIGHT FOR WOMAN WHO HAVE ENTERED POLITICS. IT'S ALSO THE ONLY NIGHT WE GET TO SEE TRUMP CARE ABOUT MORE THAN ONE RACE. LOTS OF POSITIVES TONIGHT. > > DOES EVERYBODY HAVE A COCKTAIL? DOES EVERYBODY HAVE A LITTLE SOMETHING TO DRINK TONIGHT? > > I'VE GOTTA TEQUILA BECAUSE AFTER THIS ELECTION I'M GOING TO LOSE A LOT OF AMIGOS. > > I'VE GOT A MOSCOW MULE AND DOUBLE FISTING. I'VE GOT A WEIRD SCREWDRIVER. JUST THE COLOR OF TRUMP'S FACE MIXED WITH VODKA. > > CAN YOU MAKE ME A VIRGIN JUST NEAT. DON'T DROWN IT. ON ELECTION NIGHT IN 2016, YOU SAID IF DONALD TRUMP BECOMES PRESIDENT, THERE WILL BE A LOT MORE RACISM, SEXISM, CLASSISM. HOW DOES IT FEEL LIKE TO BE RIGHT? > > I'M NOT HAPPY RIGHT NOW. I FIND IT FASCINATING THAT DONALD TRUMP WAS LITERALLY AS BAD AS EVERYBODY SAID HE WOULD BE. THERE IS ONE OTHER PERSON THAT EXCEEDED OTHER EXPECTATIONS PEOPLE HAD OF HIM. AND THAT WAS LeBRON JAMES. WE ARE ALL WITNESSES. YET, THIS ELECTION IS STILL CLOSE TONIGHT. WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON? > > I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW. YOU MIGHT KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. I UNDERSTAND YOU WERE A POLL WATCHER TODAY. GOOD FOR YOU. THAT'S A LOVELY THING TO HAVE DONE. > > I CAME FROM CALIFORNIA TO NEVADA TO BE A POLL WATCHER WITH THE NEVADA DEMOCRATIC PARTY. AND IN THE TRAINING THEY SAID BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR ANY REPUBLICANS WHO MIGHT SHOW UP WITH GUNS. I WAS LIKE, WHAT DO WE GET, WHISTLES? I GOT NOTHING. MY JOB, STEPHEN, IT WAS ACTUALLY ONE OF THE MOST BORING JOBS IN THE WORLD. MY JOB WAS TO TIME THE GUY FROM THE END OF THE LINE TO THE FRONT OF THE LINE, WHICH WOULD TAKE ABOUT TWO HOURS. I FELT LIKE A COACH FOR A TRACK TEAM THAT WAS JUST REALLY SLOW, AND AT THE END OF THE TRACK RACE ALL THEY GET IS A STICKER AND MAYBE A NEW PRESIDENT. I DON'T KNOW. > > MAYBE. MAYBE. JENNA, FOUR YEARS AGO, YOU EXPRESSED IN A VERY PITHY WAY THAT I WON'T NECESSARILY REPEAT THAT YOU WERE WORRIED AFTER IT TURNED OUT THAT DONALD TRUMP WAS GOING TO BE PRESIDENT ABOUT THE STATE OF WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS, SHALL WE SAY. AND FOUR YEARS LATER, HOW -- HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE STATE OF THOSE RIGHTS FOR WOMEN? > > I FEEL MOST SCARED FOR OUR DAUGHTERS, THE ONES WE'RE GOING TO BE FORCED TO HAVE. I'M TRYING NOT TO BE AS CRASS AS I WAS LAST TIME. > > YOU WERE CRASS. YOU WERE HONEST. IT IS ONE OF THE FEW LINES I REMEMBER. > > IT'S COOL THAT AMY CONEY BARRETT IS SO PRO LIFE. LIFE NEEDS HEALTH CARE. THAT'S ENCOURAGING. NO, IT'S NOT. I MEAN, IT'S SAD. BUT, YOU KNOW, YOU GUYS CAN GET PLAN B ONLINE AND PLAN C YOU SHOULD ALL GET THAT. IT IS CALLED MOVING TO CANADA. CHECK THAT OUT. > > OKAY. > > DONALD TRUMP MADE A BIG PUSH FOR BLACK MEN THIS TIME AROUND. HOW DO YOU THINK THAT OUTREACH WENT? > > YOU KNOW, I'M SURE HE CAPTURED A FEW. BUT BLACK MEN ARE THE SECOND LARGEST VOTING BLOCK OF DEMOCRATS, SO I DOUBT HE CAPTURED ENOUGH TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE. THEY HAD ADS DIRECT ED TOWARDS BLACK MEN. IT WAS POWERFUL. > > WHAT WAS POWERFUL ABOUT IT? > > THE ONES HIGHLIGHTING JOE BIDEN'S RECORD. HE IS ONE OF THE ARCHITECTS OF THE WAR ON DRUGS AND INCARCERATION IN THIS COUNTRY. YOU CAN'T LOOK PASTED THAT. IF YOU ARE A BLACK MAN AND YOU ARE MADE AWAY OF THESE THINGS BIDEN HAS DONE AND TRUMP IS CALLING HIM OUT ON THAT AND SAYING HE WILL DO THE OPPOSITE OF THAT. I CAN HANDLE THAT. BUT THE FASCISM THAT TRUMP BRINGS, I CAN'T HANDLE. EVEN THOUGH BIDEN RUINED BLACK COMMUNITIES IN THE PAST, TRUMP WHAT HE'S IMPLEMENTING NOW WOULD ROW WIN US MORE IN THE FUTURE, I BELIEVE. > > IT'S SORT OF A RELATED QUESTION. MAZ, MANY IRANIAN IMMIGRANTS TO THE UNITED STATES HAVE SUPPORTED THE PRESIDENT. YOU'RE IRANIAN DESCENT. WHY DO YOU THINK IN LIGHT OF THE MUSLIM BAN WHICH HE IMPLEMENTED AFTER THE COURTS SAID HE COULDN'T, WHAT IS THE REASONING BEHIND THAT SUPPORT, DO YOU THINK? > > I THINK A LOT OF IRANIAN IMMIGRANTS THINK HE WILL GET RID OF THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT. BUT THERE IS NO PLAN THERE. AS A MATTER OF FACT, I WAS PLAYING SOCCER ONE TIME AND THIS PERSON GOES, I'M A BIG FAN, BUT PLEASE STOP MAKING FUN OF TRUMP. I SAID WHY? HE SAID HE'S GOING TO GET RID OF THE MUSLIMS. I WAS LIKE WHY? HE'S LIKE, HE'S FUCKING CRAZY. WE'RE AT A POINT WHERE A LOT OF THESE GUYS HAVE DONE THAT. A LOT OF THESE GUYS HAVE GONE DOWN THE QANON RABBIT HOLE. I HAVE BECOME A POLITICAL SCIENCE TEACHER FOR AN ONLINE COLLEGE. AD THEY COME TO ME WITH ALL THEIR WHACKY IDEAS. THEY CAME AT ME WHEN HBO MAX TOOK OFF THE "GONE WITH THE WIND." I GO, WHEN DID YOU BECOME A CINCI CINEPHILE? THEY THINK CANCEL CULTURE. > > I SEE. > > THEY WERE LIKE WHAT ABOUT CANCEL CULTURE? WHAT ABOUT JOE BIDEN. EDUCATE YOURSELF. LIKE YOU SAID, THE TRAVEL BAN, THE SANCTIONS THE PEOPLE OF IRAN ARE SUFFERING UNDER. SO I DON'T KNOW. I'M TELLING YOU. I JUST CONTINUE TO DRINK. > > IT'S SO DARK THAT -- > > PLEASE. > > IT'S SO CRAZY THAT YOU HAVE TO DRESS YOUR DOG AS AN ICONIC SUPREME COURT JUSTICE. I DON'T KNOW, YOU GUYS. I'M JUST TRYING TO LIGHTEN THE MOOD. > > OH. LOOK AT RBG. SHE'S ADORABLE. > > JENNA, FOUR YEARS AGO, I ASKED YOU WHAT YOU WERE GOING TO DO NOW THAT TRUMP IS PRESIDENT. AND YOU SAID I'M GOING TO PORTUGAL. > > I HAD A GIG IN PORTUGAL. I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE THIS TIME. > > WAIT A SECOND. YOU HAD A GIG IN PORTUGAL? YOU WERE PLAYING A COMEDY CLUB THERE? > > NO. IT WAS LIKE A TECH EVENT, AND I WAS PERFORMING AT IT FOR, YOU KNOW, TECH KIDS. > > SO ARE YOU GOING TO GO ANYWHERE TOMORROW? DO YOU HAVE ANY PLANS TO GO BACK TO PORTUGAL? > > I AM STAYING PUT. AND WHEN I DO LEAVE THE HOUSE, I WEAR A MASK. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S LIKE CONTROVERSIAL. > > I'M SORRY. I FORGET. WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO GO ANYWHERE ANYMORE. > > AS THE NIGHT WINDS DOWN, ANY FINAL THOUGHTS? ANYTHING TO LEAVE US WITH? > > I GUESS MY FINAL THOUGHT IS, YOU KNOW, SIMPLE. YOU KNOW, THIS ADMINISTRATION, THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS SHOWED US WHO THEY ARE. THE QUESTION IS WILL AMERICA CONTINUE TO LET THEM BE AND WILL AMERICA CONTINUE TO LET ANY OF THIS BE? LIKE WE HAVE TO BE THE CHANGE THAT WE WANT TO SEE IN THE WORLD AND REGARDLESS OF WHO WINS TONIGHT, I HAVE WORK TO DO. I WILL KEEP JOB CREATING AND DEALING WITH POLITICS ON A LOCAL LEVEL. IF BIDEN/HARRIS WIN, I'M ON THEIR ASS IMMEDIATELY. ALL THESE PROMISES MADE DURING THIS CAMPAIGN, ALL THE CRIME BILLS BIDEN IMPLEMENTED, HE HAS TO ATONE FOR THAT. IF WE GET THEM TO THE WHITE HOUSE, WE HAVE CLEAR DEMANDS TO BE MET AND I WILL BE HOLDING DEMOCRATS ACCOUNTABLE TO MAKE SURE THEY MAKE THOSE PROMISES. > > THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. > > THANK YOU. > > AND STAY SAFE. BYE, POTATO. > > ALL RIGHT. HOPEFULLY WE'RE HAPPY TOMORROW. > > I HOPE SO. THOUGH, IT MAY NOT BE FOR A FEW DAYS. ARE WE GOING ON TO OUR FRIENDS? > > YEAH. > > TWO OTHER NETWORKS, ONE OF WHICH IS NOT CBS. AND JUST BY THE INDICATION OF YOUR FACE, TELL ME HOW IT'S BEEN CALLED. OH, BOY. SURE. GIVE ME THE OHIO CARD. WHY NOT. WE HAVE A CALL. WE HAVE A CALL COMING IN. THANK YOU, SQUIRE. OKAY. THIS IS THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE. IT'S IN THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE, OKAY. SO SEE THE MAP UP THERE? THAT'S CBS' MAP, AND IT DOESN'T HAVE THIS, WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SAY. OKAY. I MIGHT GET A SHARPIE OUT AND JUST COLOR IT IN. NOT-CBS IS READY TO CALL OHIO, HAS JUST BEEN CALLED FOR DONALD TRUMP. IT'S GONE FROM THE BUCKEYE STATE TO THE FUCK WHY STATE. WHAT DO YOU EXPECT? IT'S THE SAME SOLID JUDGMENT THAT TOOK A PERFECTLY GOOD BOWL OF CHILI AND SAID, YOU KNOW WHAT THIS NEEDS? SPAGHETTI. WHAT'S ROUND AT BOTH ENDS AND FUCKED IN THE HEAD? OHIO. ALL RIGHT. THERE YOU GO. YOU KNOW WHAT? I WOULD LOVE SOME MUSIC. SOME MUSIC WOULD BE LOVELY. LET'S -- HI! HOW ARE YOU? KEEP IT LIGHT. LATE SHOW. OKAY. AM I STANDING UP FOR THIS? OR AM I GOING IT HERE? ARE WE STILL ON THE AIR? WE'RE PASSED MIDNIGHT. WHAT DID WE PUSH? WHAT DO WE PUSH? A RERUN OF HOMELAND OR SOMETHING? WHAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ON NOW THAT IS NOT ON BECAUSE I'M DOING THIS? I WANT AN ANSWER. > > OUR CARTOON PRESIDENT. AND NOW -- HEY, THEY MIGHT GET ANOTHER SEASON. AND NOW, DEBUTING THEIR NEW SONG, GENERATION A, INSPIRED BY THE CURRENT CLIMATE OF THE COUNTRY WITH A HOPEFUL MESSAGE TO THE YOUTHS, ARCADE FIRE. > > THIS IS GENERATION X, AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO WAIT! THEY SAY WAIT A LITTLE LONGER AND THE TIMES ARE GONNA CHANGE THEY SAY WAIT UNTIL TOMORROW YESTERDAY IS ALWAYS STRANGE THEY SAY WAIT UNTIL YOU'RE OLDER AND YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THEY SAID THE GENERATION IS COMING AND I DON'T THINK THEY UNDERSTAND THAT I AM NOT A PATIENT MAN NOTE WAIT I CAN'T WAIT I CAN'T WAIT THEY SAY WAIT UNTIL YOU'RE READY WAIT UNTIL YOUR NUMBER IS CALLED THEY SAY, WAIT, ALL WE NEED IS LOVE BUT CALIFORNIA IS BURNING NEW ORLEANS IS WADING FOR THE FLOOD I CAN'T WAIT I CAN'T WAIT TOO LITTLE TOO LATE YOU THINK THEY COULD TAKE US CAN'T WAIT I CAN'T WAIT I CAN'T WAIT TOO LITTLE TOO LATE TOO LITTLE TOO LATE THEY SAY THE SUMMER OF LOVE NO THEY SAY THE SUMMER OF LO CITIES BURNING I CAN'T WAIT I CAN'T WAIT TOO LITTLE TOO LATE DO YOU THINK THEY CAN TAKE US I CAN'T WAIT I CAN'T WAIT IT'S TOO LITTLE TOO LATE TOO LITTLE TOO LATE TOO LITTLE TOO LATE TOO LITTLE TOO LATE TOO LITTLE TOO LATE. > > ARCADE FIRE, EVERYBODY. WELL, FOLKS. LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE REACHED THE END OF THE SHOW, AND WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHO WON. WE HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOR SO LONG. IT'S LIKE CHRISTMAS EVE AND NOT JUST BECAUSE OF THE JUDGMENTAL FAT GUY WITH THE RED HAT BUT BECAUSE WE'RE ALL UP LATE WONDERING IF WE'RE BEGINNING TO GET THE PRESENT WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR, A BORING PRESIDENT. LIKE YOU, I'M EXHAUSTED. NOT JUST FROM TONIGHT. ALTHOUGH, YEAH. BUT FROM THE PAST FOUR YEARS, I HAVE BEEN ON HIGH ALERT SINCE EARLY IN THE MORNING NOVEMBER 9th OF 2016. NOW, MY BLOOD PRESSURE IS WITHIN NORMAL RANGE FOR A TRUCK TIRE. YOU COULD ROLL MY AORTA OVER A GRAVEL ROAD, I WOULDN'T FEEL A BUMP. WE HAVE BEEN HOVERING OVER IN THE RED ZONE. AND EVERY TIME YOU THINK YOU CAN TAKE YOUR FOOT OFF THE GAS, A CARAVAN OF TRUMP TRUCKS TRIES TO RUN YOU OFF THE ROAD. I UNDERSTAND YOUR STRESS. I WILL. NOW I WILL SAY SOMETHING C CONTROVER CONTROVERSIAL. IT'S ACTUALLY A GOOD THING WE DON'T KNOW WHO WON YET. STOP THAT! YOU DON'T EXIST. STOP IT. THE TRUTH IS THE REASON IT'S TAKING SO LONG TO DECLARE A WINNER IS BECAUSE WE'VE HAD SUCH A MASSIVE VOTER TURNOUT. GOING INTO TONIGHT, MANY WERE PREDICTING THE HIGHEST RATE OF VOTER TURNOUT SINCE 1908. THAT WAS A CLOSE RACE, BUT WILLIAM TAFT WON IN THE POST-ELECTION WEIGH OFF. MILLIONS OF YOU BRAVED THE PANDEMIC, AN ARMY OF POLL WATCHERS, EVEN THE POST OFFICE JUST TO MAKE SURE YOU GOT TO VOTEMENT AND EACH ONE OF THOSE BALLOTS DESERVES TO BE COUNTED WHETHER THEY ARE VOTES FOR BIDEN, TRUMP OR A WRITE-IN VOTE FOR BOOBS, BOOBS, BOOBS. MANY OF YOU WAITED FOR HOURS TO MAKE YOUR VOICES HEARD. WE CAN ALL WAIT JUST A LITTLE BIT LONGER. BUT WE DESERVE SOME SMALL TASTE OF THAT SATISFACTION WE CRAVE. IN CLOSING TONIGHT, PLEASE ENJOY THIS BRIEF MONTAGE OF THINGS THAT FEEL AS SATISFYING AS YOU WANT THIS TO. > > AND NOW, THINGS THAT FEEL AS SATISFYING AS YOU WANT THIS. > > WE'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW, AMERICA, ON CBS. GOOD NIGHT!
