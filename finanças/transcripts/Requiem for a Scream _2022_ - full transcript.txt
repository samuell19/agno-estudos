- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Please, let me do it again. Please. I'll do it again. I'll do it. I'll do it right. Please. Just one more time. Please. No. I'll do it better! I promise I will do it better! Hold on. What is that? I promise. Let me try it again. Please let me try it again. Please, I'll do it better. Please, let me try it again. Please. Stop! Don't touch him! Oh, my god! - Harper, shut up! - Please. - Stay away from him! - Harper, it's okay. Just be quiet. - Don't touch him! - Harper, please shut up! - Stop it! Stop it! Get away from him! Please! Please, don't do it. Please. Please, I can try it again! Please. - That's a yes from me, dog. Hey, do you wanna pick up a couple 40s for the ride up? - Why, so that some toothless townie can mansplain the local urban legend? Plus, 40s? What are we, 18? - Um, excuse me, we were 17 the last time we pounded 40s. - True. - So, you haven't mentioned anything about your audition the entire ride up here. How did it go? - Just another cattle call. This time, they said my eyes aren't bright enough to pull off the role, whatever that means. Sounds like something my dad would say. - Yeesh, I'm sorry, Art. - I am so sick of it, which is why I'm done singing. - No, you can't. Your dad is gonna freak. - I don't love it anymore. It was always his and Emily's dream. It's time he realizes that. Anyway, what about you? How'd your interview go? I'm guessing that's why you wanted to pick up the 40s? - What? What are you talking about? - To celebrate, right? - Oh. Nah, no, I didn't go to that meeting. - Shira! Ever since I've known you, it's been your dream to work for Sinister Comics. You finally get a meeting with a development rep and you blow it off? - I mean, it's not like I was guaranteed a job. Plus, you know, if we're being honest, I'm not good enough for Sinister. - Hey, don't do that. - Do what? - Sell yourself short. You've been doing that since high school. Look, I know it's scary, but this is what you've always wanted. - Hey, I know your dad is stressing you out right now, but do not project that shit onto me. I don't need a lecture. But, you know, speaking of pissing off your dad- - Shira. - I'm serious. What do you think he's gonna do when he finds out why we actually came up here? - You know this is what Emily wanted. - Yeah, but- - But nothing. He cares more about his own grief than what our family really needs right now. Oh, shit. You're not here. Hey, Dad. - Hey, Art. You make it to the hotel yet? - Nope. Still on the road. - Oh. Okay, how's the prep for the audition going? - Good. - Make sure to really spin your vibrato for the ending. - Yeah. I got it, Dad. - I don't know get why you are still auditioning for these regional opera companies. You need to be setting your sights on New York and Chicago like your sister. - Yeah, that's the goal. - Okay, well, give me a call when you get to the hotel. I'm gonna forward you some breathing- Dad? Hello? - Thank God. - Mm-hmm. It's gonna be so much fun when you tell him your whole plan. - Ugh. ♪ Could you, could you, oh Oh, this place is like Shangri-La. - I know, right? God, I miss this place. - Can't believe you've never taken me here before. - Yeah, I know, well, my dad's always been super anal about this place being "for family time only." - Mm. Does that mean I shouldn't have invited him, then? - Seriously, he cannot find out about this. - Hey, wait, you gonna have to keep something from your father? Never had to do that before. - Ellen, when we went to your cousin's wedding in North Conway, we had good reception, right? - How am I supposed to remember that? - Pretty sure we did. - Why? - No reason. - Isn't that where Art's audition is this weekend? I hope you didn't lecture her about her vibrato. You never rode Emily this hard and she got into far more trouble. - Yeah, look where that got her. - Unbelievable. - Sorry. - Come on in. - Ooh. Jeez. Uh, why did you guys stop coming here? - We grew up. - The air... - You can just put your stuff over here for now. I'll be right back. - Wait, where are you going? - Um, I just need a minute. - Yeah, for sure. Go. Yeah. - Oh, do not eat anything in the fridge. - Okay, then. Wow. ♪ You will not be lost within ♪ Mm ♪ And you'll see the light ♪ Though the darkness seems so strong ♪ ♪ In the deepest night ♪ Let love lead you home ♪ Mm - I'm really excited to it to you. - I can see why.

So how long's the trip? - Well, it's a little long, but- - How long is "a little long"? - Don't worry. It's worth the surprise, all right, babe? - All right. - Come on. Let's go. - We've got a fireplace. - For the whole house? - Hey, can you grab some of those logs out of the car, get this thing going? - Good news, bad news? I totally forgot to bring the wood, but don't worry, hey, you know, Alex, your favorite, is gonna bring some. - Well, then, I guess we'll just have to wait for my "favorite" to arrive. - Yeah. - I cannot believe you talked me into inviting her. - Hey. You know she was one of Em's closest friends, even after everything that happened senior year. - Look, I know that you guys stayed friends, but, honestly, I want nothing to do with her. And please, no getting crazy when everyone else shows up. - Look, I already told her. No hard stuff. Besides, you and Declan, total squares. - Good. Now, let's get set up! ♪ Wrong ♪ You take me back to summer nights ♪ ♪ Don't need no rhythm or no rhyme ♪ - Boop. ♪ It sounds like ♪ Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh ♪ Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh No! ♪ She sounds like ♪ Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh ♪ Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh ♪ Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh ♪ On a winter day, take me down to White Rock Lake ♪ ♪ We'll get out our old ice skates and go a round or two ♪ ♪ And when we get cold Who the fuck owns an actual cuckoo clock? - My grandfather made that for my dad. Even my mom can't make him get rid of it. - Huh. Hey. What is this? - Hmm. - What do you think's on it? - I have no idea. - Ooh, what if it's your parent's sex tape? - Ew! God. Trust me, it's not a sex tape. Holy shit. It is a sex tape. - I'm pretty sure you have to have sex in order to make a sex tape. - Oh. - ILoveCoco? Probably just family photos or something. Let's try CraineHouse? - Who likes family photos? - My mother. - Well, now I know all your passwords. You already did. Hold on, let me try... Shit. Ugh, I give up. - This better be worth it. I'm dying. - I forgot the only exercise you get in a week is going to the fridge for a Red Bull. - Hey, you know, one can't stay up at night writing a comic book masterpiece on coffee alone. - Mm. How exactly is that going by the way? - Technically, I'm still in what some might call the brainstorming phase, but, you know, I got a whole notebook full of ideas. Character bios, scene breakdowns, the whole story arc in five acts. - So everything but the first issue. - Right, you know, some of us, ooh, don't have a cushy day job to fall back on. - Yeah, I'm really living large on a high school teacher's salary. - Hey, larger than me. I mean, either way, I'm not really sure you're in a position to speak since, you know, all of a sudden, you just decided to, what, give up your singing career? - Watch it! - Oh, what, so you can dish it, but you can't take it? - No, no, no, look. Damn hunters. They know this land is private. They don't usually set traps, but watch your step. - I'm sorry, who are "they"? - Years ago, this entire area was a trailer park. Nothing but hillbilly hunter types. - Okay, that was years ago, then why is this still here? - My dad said this place was developed into a resort town by some rich real estate guy, like, 30 years ago. I guess some of the locals had trouble moving on. - Uh, wait, you don't think that they're, like, still here watching us, do you? - I doubt it, but who knows? - Uh, we're, like, close, right? - Here we are. - Oh, this is awesome. - Hey, check it out. - Oh, my god. - Ah, my dad built this place when Emily was, like, six. I think I was probably about four. We couldn't wait for him to finish it. Finally, that day, he made us shut our eyes, took us up these stairs, held our hands, and brought us inside. - God, you're gonna make me cry. - First words out of Em's mouth were, "Daddy, can I move in? I want this to be my house." - Damn, six years old and already wanting to move out. - God. Look at this stuff. She was always an old soul. Independent from day one. - Mm. - Anyway... Em was always Dad's favorite. - No, no, you're just saying that because she's gone and you're- - No, it's true. It's okay. She was amazing. - And so are you, Art. - Before she died, Emily told me she wanted her ashes scattered around the trails out here. And regardless of what he wants or believes, I'm gonna honor her request. - Are you okay? - Remember the day Emmy found out she got into Kenzer? - How could I forget? She was so excited, she practically peed her pants. - You know, Art could've gotten in too if she just applied herself more. She'd be singing in the Met right now, instead of some second rate theater in rural New Hampshire. - Well, maybe she doesn't wanna sing for the Met. - Well, then why is she still taking auditions? I seriously doubt her dream is to sing at the North Conway Playhouse. - Well, maybe her dream doesn't include that either. - What does that supposed to mean? - I wasn't supposed to say anything, but Art lied about the audition. - What? - She doesn't wanna sing anymore. She just doesn't enjoy it. - Well, if she's not at the audition this weekend, where is she? - She's visiting Shira in the city. What are you doing? No. Thomas! Thomas, don't you dare! - Listen, no matter what your dad thinks, I am always here for you. You know that, right? - I do know that. You're the best friend ever. I love you. - I love you too. - I haven't seen either of them since high school. - I've seen Theo a couple times since high school, but, obviously, I've not talked to Declan. - It's not gonna be awkward between you two, is it? - No. We're grown-ass adults. It's been years. - Good, 'cause I think he's kinda cute now. Theo! I haven't seen you in forever. Come here My god! - Hello. - Hey, Teddy Bear. - Oh, okay. I have not heard that one in, like, forever. - Hey, Shira. - Hey, Declan. - Uh, how you been since high school? - Oh, you know, good. Moved to LA, working in the adult film industry. You know, just grinding it out. - Sounds interesting. - Okay. Um, so should we take this painfully awkward conversation inside? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Come on in. - Oh, um, the door needs to be closed. - Yeah, I'll get that. Whoa, you pack heavy for an overnighter. - No, this is a satellite dish. - What? You work for NASA now or something? - No. Remember Ronnie Glaston? - Oh, yeah. - Mm-hmm. - Well, about a year ago, Ronnie and I went in on a startup making flyaway mobile satellites. And I figured we're gonna be in the middle of nowhere, so why not bring my own mobile internet service? That's what this baby's for. - Yup, he wouldn't stop talking about this thing the whole way up. - That's amazing. I didn't even know this sort of thing existed. - Oh, you think that's cool? Check this out! We're beta testing high frequency drivers that'll knock out any listening device, think phones, scanners, smart speakers, whatever. And with this baby, you could knock out a whole city block. - Hmm. And it'd work on Declan? - Funny. - But it has a few bugs, so we don't keep that in there. - So you're a pornstar and a comic book writer? - I was kidding about the porn. And I'm not really a comic book writer. - Yet. But she should be. - Mm. - It's good to see you after all these years, Dec. You look great. - Thank you. You too. You're also looking- - What the actual fuck? - Very nice too. - Ah! - You invited Alex? - Don't remind me. - Feel like I just stepped on the set of "Lord of the Rings" or some shit. Look at this. It's like "Breakfast Club" reunion. We have the jock. The nerd. The basket case. - Ah. Oh! If I'm the basket case, so what does that make you? - The rebel, of course. - Oh, okay. - So I guess that makes me the princess now? - Nah. That was Emily. You are more like the principal. - Sorry, sorry. - Oh, ow. - Fuck is that? - Shit. - Ah! - Okay. - Sorry. I'm just trying to find a signal. - That's gonna make me deaf. - Fix it. - Hey, Art, how do I get on the roof? - Come on. Follow me. Come on. I'll show you. Ugh. - Yup. - Sorry. - Mm-hmm. No. - Still not working. - Yeah. Well-aware, guys. Almost there. - Ah! It works! - Oh, thank God! - Yes! - I probably have to reconfigure it every couple of hours. - Can we go inside now? Need a fucking drink. - Shit. Tell me about it. Hey. - Hey, hey. - I'm really glad you all could make it out this weekend. - Of course. - Of course. - Of course. - Hey, I'm really sorry I couldn't make Emily's funeral. - Me too. Between dad's back surgery and the new company, I just couldn't get there. - And I was slammed with my Etsy store. - Look what I found. - Ooh. Just what the doctor ordered. - Go for it. Well, that's why you're all here now. Even though, you know, some of us lost touch, you were all super important to Em. I know she'd want you to be here. - Emily would have loved my Etsy store. - Really? What do you sell? - These crystal bracelets. They help realign your chakras. - Is everyone in? - None for me. - Please. - Yes. - Yeah. - Wow, business must be booming if you had to miss Emily's funeral. - Yeah, I would've brought you some, but there aren't enough bracelets in the world to help realign your chakras. - Hey, hey, hey, hey, you know, why don't we just keep the peace and focus on Emily today? - Fine. Give me this. I changed my mind. All right. To Emily. - To Emily. - When was the last time you got on that? That thing? Oh, my god, I don't know. When I was 12, maybe? - Hop on. - What? - Yeah, I'll push. - No. Come on. - Are you scared? Come on. - No. - Get your ass in there. Literally. - Okay, fine. Not too high. - All right. Do you trust me? - I hope so. - Are you sure? Woo! God, this is so much. - So, you a big time opera singer yet? - Not even. I actually just quit. - What? Come on, Art, the world deserves to hear that amazing voice of yours. - I don't know about the whole world. But if you really wanna hear me sing, I'm pretty sure my dad has a karaoke machine somewhere. - Is that too high? - No, it's perfect. I don't remember you being this chivalrous in high school. - Chivalrous? - Mm-hmm. - I like that. You know, I have changed since high school. - Oh, have you? - Yes, I have. - Okay. - Not entirely, but I've changed a little bit. - I knew it! - So, I take it you're not too happy he's here? - Whatever. Forgive and forget. - Yeah, but he did dump you right before prom so he could date college chicks. How does one get over that? - Like this. - Mm. Oh. Well, if you really wanna piss off that asshole... - Mm-mm, mm-mm. Put that away. - Oh, come on. Don't make me do it by myself. - I'm just not feeling it. This weekend should be about Emily, right? - Is that you talking or Principal Artemis? - Dammit! - Slow down, Scarface. We're gonna be out soon. - Just call me Tony Montana. - Hello, Teddy Bear. - Oh, shit. - What are you two up to? - I'm just watching a movie. - Mm-hmm. - Oh, that's it? - Mm-hmm. - Yeah, why? - I don't know, you two seem a little... Oh. - Um, the Wi-Fi is out. Do you think you could be a dear and fix it? - Sure. I love you. - Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. - Okay, I think that means that we need to stop. - Whatever, I wanna have some for tomorrow, anyway. - Hey, no. That's when we're scattering Emily's ashes. - So? Looks like the lovebirds have returned. Glad to see you've matured since high school, Alex. - Didn't you say something about a karaoke machine? - Shit. I thought maybe you forgot about that. - Hell, yeah, girl. - I'm on it. - It's my dad. Be quiet. - Shh. Shh. - Hello? - Finally. I've been calling you all night. - Yeah, sorry. The connection's been pretty unreliable. - Oh, yeah, that's not the only thing that's been unreliable lately. - What are you talking about? - Why didn't you just tell me? - Tell you what? - Artemis, your mother told me about the audition. - Dad, I was gonna tell you. I was just waiting for the right opportunity. - I don't get it. I don't get it. You are so talented. You just need to apply yourself. - I don't wanna sing anymore. - I thought that is what you wanted. Artemis, that is what you've been working toward this whole time. - No, that's what you've been working toward! - How can you say that? - Oh, come on, you just want me to live out the life that Emily was supposed to! - How dare you say that to me? - Shh! - Shh. - You know it's true. - This conversation is over. - I'm not Emily, and I'm never gonna be! - You're goddamn right you're never gonna be 'cause Emily would've never pissed away a perfectly good career because she was too afraid to live up to her own goddamn potential! Shit. I didn't mean that. Art. Art. - Shit. - What was that? - Dad, look, I'll call you later, okay? Fuck. - Who's ready for some karaoke?! - Woo, woo! - Howdy! - Hey. - Oh, yeah! - Oh. Uh, everything okay? - Yeah. - Should I put it back? - No. I think that we need some cheering up. - Yeah. - Isn't that right? What do you say? Come on. What do you say, what do you say, what do you say? - Okay. - What's wrong with you? - Did you know about this? - Know about what? - Your daughter replaced Emily's ashes with goddamn brownie mix! - What? - She's up at the summer house right now. - I don't understand!

Oh, that's what she said. Ow, ow! - Okay. - Never have I ever had a foursome. Wait. - Yo. - I thought you said- - That was before Matt. - Okay. - Really, I promise. - Okay. My turn! My turn, my turn.

No way. - Yeah, you were there. What are you, high? - Pshh, no. I think you're the one that's high, remembering shit that never happened. - We were all there, Shira. How can you forget that? - No one asked you, micro-shaft. - Really, Shira? Wow. That's a bit harsh. - Jesus, Shira! - Relax! It was an accident. - Don't worry about it. I'll help clean it up. And Shira's just having a brain fart. Shira, you were there. You remember. - Where? - At Jimmy whatever's birthday party. I'm gonna get rid of this. You've had too much. - Whoa. What the fuck?! - It's a fucking coffee can, Art! - No, it's not, they're Emily's ashes. And she knew that. - I know, I'm sorry. - What the hell is going on here? - What are you looking at me for? - Because the two of you have been acting strange all night. - Wow, you sound like your dad right now. - Really? Well, how about this? Never have I ever broken a promise to my best friend. - That's shitty. - Well? - What? - You're high as a fucking kite, Shira. - So what if she is?! Would that be the worst thing in the world? - No, not for her biggest enabler. - Okay. It's my turn. Never have I ever held a grudge since high school. - Never have I ever almost ruined my sister's entire future! - Hey! If we're getting personal, never have I ever given up on a dream! - At least I pursued my dreams before gave up on them, Shira. - Fuck off, Art. - That's low, even for you- - Let's just shut up, okay, Alex? Where are you going? - I need air. Fucking shit. - Listen, shut up, okay? What, are your fucking stupid bracelets not working, not aligning your chakras? - I'm aligned as fuck. - You're doing lines as fuck, bitch. - Maybe we should play a different game? - What the fuck is wrong with you?! This weekend was supposed to be about Emily and you ruined it the same way you almost ruined her chance at Kenzer. - Oh, my god, you are still holding that grudge from high school. Even Emily forgave me! - You didn't deserve her forgiveness! - Guys, just calm down! - Was just a little bit of blow! - Ah, I knew it! - Can we please stop arguing? This is not what Emily would've wanted. - Alex obviously doesn't care what Emily would've wanted. She doesn't care what anyone wants. - Shira! What happened?! Go grab a towel from the bathroom! Grab all the towels you can find! You're gonna be okay. You're gonna be okay. It's all gonna be okay. - Do you think an animal could've done this? - Shit. - She's losing a lot of blood! - She's gonna be fine, okay?! Just call an ambulance, right now! Hurry! - I can't get a signal! - You're okay. - Shit, I've gotta readjust the satellite. - I'll do it! - No, no, no, no. You don't know how to do it. I'll do it. - Wait, wait, wait. We don't know what's out there. - Theo, go to the kitchen now, okay? I think there's a first aid kit in one of the cabinets, okay? Stay with me. Stay with me. Need to hold her. Hold it. Hold that. Okay. Hold her head. - Please don't die. - No, she's not gonna die! Okay?! Stop it! - I found it. Oh, shit. - This is useless! It's all useless! - Shira, Shira, Shira, look at me, okay? I cannot lose you too. I can't lose you too, okay? Just stay with me, okay? Shira? Shira. Shira! Shira, wake up! Shira! Shira, no! No! Shira. No, no. - Okay. Okay, okay. Okay. - How did this happen? - What kind of animal could do that? - I have no idea. - What do we do now? - Is she dead yet? - Who is that? - Where's it coming from? She is, isn't she? - Who is this? - You've got something that belongs to me. - What do we have? What is he talking about? - I have no idea. Why would I know? - Give it to me. What is it? Just tell us and we'll give it to you. - It's a memory card, son. And it's my personal and private property- - What's going on? - I don't know, but Shira and I found a memory card when we were setting up. We couldn't open it. It was encrypted or something. - Well, where is it? - In my computer. Okay, okay. Let me. Be careful, goddammit! - He can see us! Get down! Hey, we've already called the police, so you might wanna get the hell outta here. - We both know that isn't true. - We need to see what's on this card. - Yeah. Hey, will you come with me real quick? - Yeah. - Wait, wait, wait, wait, what about us? - You and Alex stay here. Just make sure this place is locked down. Close every single curtain. - Do whatever makes you feel safe. But if you kids are planning on going anywhere, someone might've slashed your tires. But I want that card. And I won't wait forever. Come on. - What are we doing? - We need protection. - Clearly. But with what? - Shut up and help me look! Go, go this way. - Fuck yeah. I think I hit the jackpot. And there's more. - Where? Show me, go. Holy shit. I'm in! - What'd you find? - They're audio files. - Rebecca, Soprano. Wilson, Tenor? What are these? - We're about to find out. - Turn it off! Turn it off! - I'm trying! I'm trying. - What the hell was that? - Do you like my work? - Who is this guy? - Look out the window. Do you see me? We see you. Keep an eye out. - All I need is that card. Then, I'll be on my way. - You killed my best friend for no reason. Do you think we're just gonna waltz on out there and give it to you?! - Why the hell not, Art? You heard the man. We give him the card and he'll leave us alone. - This card is the only thing that's stopping him from killing us. - In the upstairs bedroom, on top of the dresser, there's a red jewelry box. Inside is a ring. Replace the ring with the card. Tape it shut and toss it outside. - How do you know what's in the upstairs bedroom? - I'd get busy if I were you. - Hey, hey. What are you doing? - I'm going to get that jewelry box. I wanna end this. - I don't think you understand what's going on here, okay? That man was in this place before any of us showed up today. - So? - So this is not just about a memory card, Alex! - What, then? - I don't know. - Look, we just need to reset the Wi-Fi so we can call the police. - No, no, no. He will hear the beeping if I go for the satellite. - Oh. Do you guys remember seeing a police station on your way in? - Yeah, it was like five miles back. - I'm not saying that we run there. - What are you saying, then? - There's a flare gun in the tree house. It's a couple hundred yards away, but the path is mostly hidden by trees. So if I can just get there- - Yeah, I'll go. - And fire it off... - I'll go. - I'm the only one who knows where it is. - No. - No, are you nuts? He'll kill you the minute you step outside. - We can't just sit here and do nothing! - The hell are we supposed to do? - I have an idea. - Okay. Max out the phone and speakers. - No! - Okay. It's all cued up. - Okay. Do you wanna chuck it, or should I? - You. - Do you see him? - Still out there? - Is he still out there? - I'm sorry I let things get out of hand earlier. Maybe if I hadn't, Shira would still be- - Hey, no. It's not your fault that Shira died. And I'm sorry that I brought up ancient history. - We were just so excited about your parents being out of town and then we didn't even realize Emily's audition was the next day. It was my fault and I'm sorry. - Hey, she nailed it, just like she always did. - Let's hope we nail this plan. - Yeah. - Do you think the boys are they ready upstairs? - Here, let me. - How'd you learn to tie a knot like that? I know it wasn't the Boy Scouts. - Let's just say this isn't my first time being tied up. - How have I not heard that story? - Well, hold on to this rope and I'll tell you if I- - Hey, I got you. You're gonna be fine. Yeah? - Mm-hmm. What if it snaps? - It won't. Just remember, stay low, okay? 'Cause he can't see you from down there. - So, like, really stealthy. - Exactly. Stealthy, buddy. Like a fucking ghost. - I'm sorry. I've wanted to do that for, like, forever. - No shit, Sherlock. Now, come on. - Okay. - So, are you coming out, or am I coming in? - We're aiming for 20 yards from the swing. - Mm-hmm. - But not too close. We're buying time for Theo, got it? - Yeah. Press play. Declan, now! Here's my phone. Keep checking for a signal, okay? - Come on, buddy. Come on, Theo. - Come on, come on, come on. Theo, you got this. That's it, that's it. That's it. Oh, my god, where is he? I got it! 911. What's your emergency? - Oh, thank God you answered. Listen Hello? Hello?! What? No! Theo! - Was that Declan? - Something's not right. - I don't know what happened. I think he fell. - You were supposed to be holding him! - I did! I was! But then, I don't know, I think the rope snapped! - I had a fucking connection! I had the cops on the phone and then the phone fucking drops! - Forget the fucking phone, okay?! We have to help Theo! - Are you kidding me? I'm not going out there. Have you forgotten Shira's bloody body on the couch?! - We can't just leave him, okay? What if he broke his leg? Or worse? - He's a fucking psycho, Dec! - Where's Art? What are you doing? - Move! - No, hold on a sec. - Declan, move! - Hold on a second! - Art! - Hello, Artemis. Let's make some music, shall we? - No, no! Inside! Get inside! Get inside. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. - You had to try. I get it. But now that you got that out of your system, let's stop playing games. You have 30 minutes. - Now what? - We wait for the cops to come. - Thought you said the call was dropped? - But it connected. Maybe they'll trace it. - We're in the middle of bumfuck nowhere. You really think they trace calls out here? I mean, don't you have to be on the line for, like, 30 seconds or something? - That's just in the movies. - I can't- - Art? Art, where are you going? You okay? Art? Are you okay? Can I come up? Look, I know it was tough losing Shira, and now Theo. But, I promise you, we're gonna get through this. - It's not just that. - Then what? - This is all my fault. This was for Emily and I could leave here with no one. - Look, look, look, I know we came up here for this, but we can't worry about it right now. - I'm not. I need to make sure you guys get out of here alive. - Well, who can we call? How can we get help? We're in the middle of fucking nowhere, okay? We've got nothing. We've got nothing. Hey, what about your dad? I mean, surely he knows you're up here. - I didn't tell him. - Why not? - Because he was against it from the start. I tried to convince him this is what Emily wanted, but he just can't fucking let go. I was trying to do this for my family. I was trying to do this for us. And now look! - I know your dad's a hard ass, but I also know that he loves you. He loves you more than anything. - He always put Emily on a pedestal. I'm just... I'm not what he wants. - No. - I'm not, I'm not her. I can't be Emily 2.0. I just can't. - It's not a competition. He loves you both. He loves you more than anything. I know that. And deep down, deep down, he knows you're right. - Was I? Because of me, he might lose another daughter. - Hey, come here. Come here. Come here. Look, I got you. I'm here. I got you. But we need a plan. Okay? So what's the plan? What's the plan? - Everything okay? - No! What are you doing? - Okay, so I was crashing really hard, and that's not something we want, believe me. - Our friends are dead. We need you focused, Alex. - What do you think this is for? Y'all should do some too. - Give me this. - You bitch. - Hey, hey, hey. Look, the enemy's out there, not in here. Two-minute warning. - What do you want from us? - You weren't supposed to be here. - Neither were you! - I was here first. - What does that mean?! This is my house, fucker! - You're merely occupying it. One more minute. - What? What is it? - I didn't press the talk button. - So? - He's listening. Let's just give him what he wants. - Are you serious? You were the one that said that was our only leverage. - Don't do it. - What other choice do we have? - Time's up. - We're bringing it out to you now. - Are you sure about this, Art? - I don't know what else to do. - Where do you want me to throw it? - Straight ahead. - Suck on this, you hillbilly fuck. Go. Now. Alex. Now! - We should run. - What about Artemis? - What about her? Isn't that why we agreed to this plan? - What are you talking about? - Come on, you knew as well as I did that she was dead the minute she stepped outside. - What? - Where is it? - We agreed to this plan because it bought us more time, right? - Time for what? - Time to save our asses! - Art was right about you. I can't believe I was ever friends with you. You are selfish- - Oh, shit! - And so fucking low! What? - He's gone. - Shit. What the hell is that? Caleb Burns? Oh, my god. No! No! Where is it?! No! Come on! Hurry up! - You think she made it? - We should run. - What about Artemis? - Be a hero if you want to, I'm outta here. - It's not safe! He could be anywhere. - Move! - Hey! Look, I know you don't give a shit about me, or Art, or anything for that matter, but Shira and Theo are dead! So for once in your fucking life, could you think about something other than yourself?! Hide. - Artemis. - Mr. Craine? - Declan? What the hell are you doing here? Where's Artemis? - We need your help! Someone's trying to kill us! - Sure about that, Alex? What kinda drugs are you kids on? - Shira and Theo are dead. - Artemis, get your ass out here! I know you took Emily's ashes. Police. Open up. - They traced my call. - We're responding to a 911 emergency call. - There's a murderer out there. He's already killed two of- - Knock it off! My name is Thomas Craine, I own this house. - You're not getting it! - What I'm not getting, Declan, is why you two are here and I can't find my daughter. Arrest these two. And anyone else who is hiding in my house, trespassing on private property. - Mr. Craine, please! - You're not going anywhere till I get some more information. - Come here, I can show you! - Hold up, son. Where do you think you're going? - Oh, my god. Shira. You were telling the truth. - Yeah, I was telling the truth. - Patrol, this is Officer Adler. Got a 187 at 1024 Trapper's Avenue. I need backup immediately. - I need to find my daughter. - Sir, this is now an active crime scene. You have to stay here. - What? I'm not the killer. I wasn't even here! - And how do I know that? - Declan, tell him! - Stay right here, everybody. No one leaves this house until backup arrives. Now, any ideas why anyone would want to kill your friends? - It's something about a memory card? - Memory card? - Yeah. - Any idea what's on it? - I don't know, it's really fucked up. Like screaming and people dying, but to music? - Dying? Well, of course, I'm gonna need that as evidence. - Yeah, it's right here. - Ah, perfect. Thank you, sweetheart. - I'm sorry, Officer, but why are we talking about some memory card when my daughter could be out there with a murderer?! - Hold on. You said you got a call? - Yeah. Came in at 2:28. - I'm curious, how'd you know the address if the call dropped? - We may be a small town operation, son, but we trace all our calls. Now, about the music... - Music? - On the memory card. - Well, I wouldn't call it music. - No? - How is this relevant?! - Sir, I'm trying to have a conversation. Declan... Oh, there you are. What do you think about the music? Any good? - Officer, are you okay? You got blood coming out of your ear. Declan, no! - It's him! It's him! - Take a wild guess. - Dad. What is this? - Welcome back, Artemis. - Dad! - "Dad!" "Dad!" "Dad!" Hey, Dad. Stop! - Ah. There you are. Thank you for joining us. - Oh, my god. Artemis, are you okay? - You know, I've been in every single house in this town and they all reek of superficial decadence, but not this one. There's a warmth here. Built on the same patch of land that I grew up on, until you took it. - I legally purchased this house over 20 years ago. - Now, you could say, this is my home away from home. And every year, I'm treated to a fresh batch of pictures. Birthdays, recitals, summer barbecues. Emily's passing was hard on all of us. - How do you know my daughter? What the fuck is this?! - Oh, I've known all about you since you bought the place. I consider you family, Thomas. I'd like to introduce you to your second born. No, not the one with all the trophies and framed smiling photos, this is Artemis. The forgotten one. - That's not true. Tell him, Art. Tell him it's not. Oh, god, I did this. - No! This isn't your fault, Dad. - Yes, it is. You wouldn't be here if I'd just listened, paid more attention, stopped pushing you to be Emily. Just miss her so goddamn much. - I miss her too. - I know you were just doing what you thought was right, what she would've wanted. - Yeah. - Oh. I don't usually record spoken word, but this will pair nicely with the sounds of your deaths. You're probably wondering how the hell you ended up in these unfortunate circumstances. Was it because you commandeered our land, uprooting my father and me when I was just a mere six-year-old child? Or was it my envy of you Craines with your perfect lives, with your perfect family, that drove me to commit these unspeakable acts of depravity? Or was it just that darn memory card? And given the fact that you'd all heard its contents, well, maybe I had no choice but to tie up the loose ends. - Or maybe your daddy just didn't love you the way you wanted to be loved. I saw the photos. - Artemis, don't. - You did? Well, yes, my father was a downright motherfucker of a man, which is why I killed him. But I digress. Truth be told, the reason that you and your daddy are sitting here right now and your dear friends have gone to His eternal reward is due to the simple fact that humans suffering is music to my ears. Or should I say, my ear? Thank you very much. Ready. - I don't understand what you want. - Wrong. - No, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, what are you doing?! Please! No! No! Stop! Please stop! Stop!

Let's test your limits. A high C. ♪ Ah Your daughter is an immense talent. Let's hope she gets it from you. Memory card's full. I'll be back. Shit. - Artemis.
