(siren wailing) - [Dave] In pursuit, heading west on rural Route 47. I need some backup. (siren wailing) (car crashing) (siren wailing) (suspenseful music) - Heather! (door thudding) (gun firing) No! (gun firing) (Cody grunting) (suspenseful music) Heather, Heather (crying). (suspenseful music) - Hey fucker, how was it? - Three hots and a cot. (both laughing) - So, what's your plan? - Head up to the cabin at Sugarloaf. We'll do us a little hunting. - What're we hunting? - Big game, kid, big game (laughing). (suspenseful music) (bell ringing) - You know, that's very good. That's very true, Miss Peterson, thank you. You've obviously read the text, and I wish that everybody would read the text, because it's very exciting, but can you tell me, can anybody tell me what is at the core of the idea? What is the key to Darwin's philosophy? What inherited, possibly cultivated trait dictates who survives and who perishes? Miss Reynolds, Elaine, perhaps you can enlighten us. What is the key to survival according to Darwin? - I don't know. - Bang, you're dead. Mr. Selner, any ideas? - Ah, evolution? - Oh, evolution, evolution dictates who survives, and you survived. Close, Mr. Selner. You and Miss Reynolds were knee deep in flirtation. You were forced to join the herd in its move. She perished, you survived, because you evolved, because you adapted. The ability to adapt to our surroundings, that is the essence of survival. (bell ringing) Okay, on Monday we're gonna take a look at birth defects, and the notion of involuntary adaptation mutation. And remember, no matter how hard he tries, man can never remove himself from evolution. He can not separate himself from the animal kingdom. (mysterious music) Toni, listen, I know you've been through a lot. I'm gonna let you in on a little secret. Life never stops for us to catch our breath. You know the worst thing that we can do at any age is to stop, disengage, be apathetic. Trust me, I know from experience, we gotta keep moving, we gotta keep trying. You know, make a decision, Toni. Join the swim team, write a short story, paint your masterpiece. Let go, join in. We never know where our decisions are gonna lead us. Toni, everything's gonna be all right. (mysterious music) - Baby brother, man, a freakin' loser. (Cody laughing) - Give the kid a break, man. At least he doesn't live in fuckin' van like you. (knocking on door) - Dickle, he hates that shit. (knocking on door) Hey, Dickle, open up, hey. - Hey, Luke, I made some coffee, you want some? - Fuck yeah, shit. - Cody! (Luke laughing) I thought you got out on the ninth? - It is the ninth, Pick. Damn, I like what you done around here. - Oh yeah, yeah, your little brother's a regular Martha Stewart. Jesus, it smells like shit in here, Pick. What do you got ass juice on the curtains, and duct tape on the fuckin' everywhere? - Well, you can fix anything with duct tape. - Ooh, a whole half a cup. - Coffee doesn't grow on trees. - Wanna make some real money, Pick? - Yeah, how much? - Maybe a hundred bucks. - Hundred bucks, yeah. Is it legal? (all laughing) - [Luke] Does it matter? (all laughing) - [Brian] Can't your cousin get us into the kegster? - Yeah, he's a senior. He can totally-- - Okay, the word is kegger, assface, not kegster. Being my cousin just moved here a month ago, plus he's a jock. I mean, he wouldn't even talk to us if we passed him in the hallway. Why would I wanna go to some loser jock kegger anyway? - Hey, you guys wanna go to the kegger today? - Yeah, that, that would be great. - Then come, man. You guys are cool. I'll let Chaz and the guys know. - We're in, see, no problem. (suspenseful music) - Hi. - [Toni] Hi. - Um, I was, there's a kegger after school. I was wondering, do you wanna go? I mean with me, do yo wanna go with me? It doesn't have to be like a. - Sure, I'll go. - Great. - I'll meet you there. - Okay, great, I'll see you there. (suspenseful music) - See, Pick, you gotta be more like me. Look, I've been working on a philosophy about which to live. Hell, we're gonna have a little money. Well, it's like what Nietzsche says. (Cody whistles) - Come on, we got the honeymoon suite. - Shit, fuckin' yeah (laughing). I hope they got that Skinamax. I love titty flicks. (mysterious music) (suspenseful music) - You want something to drink, hon? - Ooh, a cup of coffee oughta do it. - Some cream and sugar? - Oh, just stick your finger in it, it'll make it sweet (chuckles). - You wanna see a menu? - Coffee's fine for now, thank you. (suspenseful music) - Nice, you're good. - Thank you, what's your name? - Toni. - Toni, with an I? - [Toni] Mm hmm. - [Cody] Where you from? - I'm from the Springs. - Really, nothing down that way, well, a monument. - We moved here like six months ago. - Wow, a beautiful girl from the Springs. Tell me you like Pabst Blue Ribbon, and I'll buy the ring now (laughing). (mysterious music) (suspenseful music) - More liquor. - It used to be so different, way different, but after. When my mom was around it was fun. We laughed all the time, but now I don't even. I'm sorry, I'm talking too much. - Life throws all kinds of crazy curves at ya, especially if you ain't ready for it. Believe me, that's one thing you can count on. Hell, your old man, he's doing the best he can, right? Well, you can't give up on a guy just because he hits a rough patch. (mysterious music) Hell, this stuff's just temporary anyway. Can't take it with you when you die, can ya? It's just a big game. (mysterious music) - [Toni] I should get going. - Oh hey, I got that. You might have to do a little favor for me. You gotta take a picture with me. You don't mind that, do you? Those pretty eyes of yours. (Toni chuckles) You don't mind, do you? (mysterious music) - I gotta go. - Listen, ah, you don't wanna forget this. This is gonna be worth a lot of money some day when I'm dead. - Thank you. - Listen, you should smile more. Looks good on you. (suspenseful music) Toni with an I. - [Crowd] 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 (cheering)! - Come on, you said you wanted to come. Don't be such pussies.

Thinning of the herd. ("I'm Popeye the Sailor Man") (Cody laughing) - Hey, Cody, when do I get my money? - [Cody] Huh? - The money? - You do as I tell ya, and you lay low, and stay outta trouble. I'm gonna go out there and get some bait for us, and I guarantee you'll get some money. - [Becky] Is this your house? - Uh no, it's a few houses down, but you can let me out here, it's fine, thanks. ♪ It's just the evidence and how it was presented ♪ ♪ So what do you take me for ♪ The case is closed (suspenseful music) (mysterious music) (telephone ringing) - [Sheri] Hi, you've reached the Roberts.

I mean, I don't really know her, shit. It's not like we can do anything. - Chris, look, something bad's going down, all right.

(suspenseful music) - Shit. - Let's just go back. - You really are a pussy boy, huh? - No, I'm smart. Let's go back to the main road, find a gas station and call the cops.

What the fuck you hit me with? - [Luke] I didn't hit you. (Toni whimpering and gasping) - Hey, Cody, I discovered we don't have electricity. Hey, what's that? - This is the fruits of two years hard labor. - [Luke] Get in here, you too, asshole. Go on, move! Get up, let's go! Sit down on the floor! - Have a seat, Pick. If any of these sons of bitches so much as even flinch, I want you to shoot 'em. I'm gonna go get me that girl. Y'all stick around (clicks tongue), let's roll. - Hi, my name is Pickle. (Toni gasping and crying) - [Toni] My leg's burning. - Let me see it. It just grazed you. It'll be all right. We gotta slow the bleeding down.

Take this, do you know how to use it? - [Toni] Yeah, my dad taught me. - [Mark] With any luck, they'll pass right by us, and we'll go back and get the others. - [Toni] Okay. (suspenseful music) - Hey, I know you're down there! (gun clicks) I'm gonna count to three and I'm gonna give you something. (suspenseful music) One, two. (Mark screaming) Three! (gun firing) Aw, God damn! (suspenseful music) (Luke grunts) Fuck! (suspenseful music) - [Toni] Wait, wait, wait, wait, ah! - [Mark] You all right? - [Toni] Yeah. - Let me see it. - Ah, I'll be all right. I'll be all right. - Give me the gun. (suspenseful music) The clip's empty. - [Toni] What're you gonna do? What're you gonna do? (suspenseful music) - Drop it, drop it. - [Chris] Mark. - Chris, are you okay? (Chris grunts) Sorry. - [Chris] My arm is killing me. - [Mark] Are you guys okay? - Yeah, yeah. - What happened to her? - She got shot. - She got shot, what? - [Mark] Shh. - Who the fuck are these guys, huh? - Chaz, clam down, calm down. All right, we gotta find shelter. We gotta move this way and fast, all right. Come on, come on. - [Chris] Dude. (suspenseful music) (Pickle snoring) - What the fuck happened in here? (gun firing) What the fuck happened? - I got hungry. - You were hungry? Next time I will feed your ass in fuckin' lead. You got that (hisses)? Christ! - Luke, I-- - [Luke] Shh. What about the girl? - Fuck the girl. He don't know what the hell happened anyway. He'll still come. (suspenseful music) - Uh, Toni, I uh. (suspenseful music) (Dave laughing) (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) (crickets chirping) - What do you think? - I think we should keep moving. - We need to rest. - Where, fuck that, man. Those guys could be right behind us. - Then keep moving. Toni can barely walk. I need to fix Chris's arm. All right, we need two hours. Here, give me this. I'll be back, man. - Yesterday, I ditched seventh period, and I went to a cafe and he was there. - Who was there? - The one with the beard. - (scoffs) That's great, Toni. So basically, what you're saying is the reason that we're all here is because of you. You fuckin' bitch. - [Megan] God, Chaz, leave her alone. - Oh, I'm sorry, Megan. - There's a spot about six yards up that way. You and I will take turns on watch, all right. All right, cuz, are you ready for this? (suspenseful music) - Chaz, Chaz, are you asleep? - Huh, what? - I took something from the cabin. - What? - When I went back inside the cabin earlier, I took something. (suspenseful music) - Megan, are you crazy? Megan, they're gonna miss this. - Fuck them. Give me your jacket. God, don't be such a pussy. What, you need your idiot friends around you to be brave? Help me with this. (suspenseful music) - [Chaz] Megan. - Shut up, just go to sleep. (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) (car crashes) - No! (gun firing) (Cody grunts) (suspenseful music) (Pickle snoring) Wake your ass up, little brother. (crickets chirping) - [Mark] Chaz, Chaz. - [Chaz] Hmm? - [Mark] Chaz. - [Chaz] What? - It's your watch. - Okay. - Dude. - Okay, okay. - Give me one hour. (crickets chirping) (suspenseful music) - Cody, remember that bike Dad left for us? You know, right before he went away. You know, the one with the sissy bar that I used to tie my skateboard to and drag me around? Well, after you went away, in the window of that pawn shop, I saw a bike, looked exactly like it. Well, it didn't have the banana seat, and it was blue, not red, but it reminded me of that bike. Well, you know I've been collecting cans. (suspenseful music) Well, the price of the bike is 149.99. I'd hoped to have it for us by the time you got home, but I guess it's just taking me longer than I thought, but with my collecting, I should be done in about nine days. (chuckles) Amazing, hand in some garbage, and they give you a new bike. That might be my most amazing discovery yet. - Turn around, buddy. - I know it doesn't have a banana seat, and is it okay the bike is blue and not red? (crickets chirping) (gun firing) (crickets chirping) (crickets chirping) (suspenseful music) - Where's Pick? (suspenseful music) - Hey, uh, you reached the Roberts, and uh, Dave and Toni can't get to the phone right now, but if you leave a message, we'll get back to you, okay. Hey, uh, you reached the Roberts, and uh. (Luke grunting) - [Cody] You all right, Lukie? - I'm fine. - Don't like water. We gotta find the easiest route. There's a cabin, it's down that way. I know this country like the back of my hand. - How you know they're gonna be there? - It's human nature. (suspenseful music) - I'll show you who's a fuckin' pussy. (gun firing) - You see (laughing). (Luke grunts) - No, it's fine, it's fine. - What do you mean it's fine? - The gun just went off on accident. - What're you trying to get us killed, man? - No, I'm not trying to get us killed. (gun firing) Ah, fuck, shit, oh shit! - [Mark] Come on, come on, move, move! (suspenseful music) Come on, get up, they're coming! (suspenseful music) - [Chaz] Fuck, what do we do? (gun firing) (Megan screaming) (suspenseful music) - [Mark] It's our only chance, all right, we jump! - [Chris] You're crazy! - We jump or we die! Right now, come on! Jump or die! (Megan screaming) Jump! (suspenseful music) (Toni screaming) (Megan screaming) - Jesus Christ, that's the craziest shit I've ever seen. - Stupid fuckers. All right, they ain't getting away from me. I know a service road. It runs about half mile alongside the river, all the way fuckin' down. (suspenseful music) (gun firing) (Luke screaming) (suspenseful music) God, damn it. (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) - [Dave] Heading west on rural Route 47. I need some backup. (siren wailing) - [Dispatcher] Ah, Unit 35, we ran the plate, and the vehicle is registered to a Cody Sullivan. Proceed with extreme caution, Dave. The suspect is most likely armed and dangerous. - Roger. (siren blaring) (suspenseful music) - Heather! (door thuds) (gun firing) (Cody grunts) (suspenseful music) No! - [Man] You're drunk, aren't ya? You're drunk, aren't ya?

We gotta find shelter and get his body temperature back up. - But Megan. - We can't, she's gone. Come on, come on, Toni! (Luke grunting) (suspenseful music) (Luke laughing) (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) (Luke grunting) (suspenseful music) - [Mark] Take your clothes off. - [Chris] What? - [Mark] Take your clothes off. Don't worry, she's taking hers off too. Hurry up. (Chris shivering) - Help him out of those pants, Toni. - I got, I got, I got it. - Sit down. We're gonna be all right. We're gonna be okay. Chris lay down, lay down in the middle. (Chris shivering and gasping) - [Toni] Okay, there, there. - You guys, I'm gonna.

(suspenseful music) - Hey, fucker. - The prodigal son. (Luke coughs) - Water, give me some water. - I ain't about to waste no water on a dying man, Lukie. Like Nietzsche said, it's time to thin the herd. (suspenseful music) (gun firing) (Luke grunts) (suspenseful music) - Howdy, neighbor. (suspenseful music) Rise and shine! (gun firing) (Toni screams) (Mark grunting) I'm getting sick of you, boy! Time to die. - [Toni] Don't! - You gonna get tough with me, huh? You getting tough with me? - Fuck you. - Fuck me? You're gonna bleed out anyway. Why would I waste a round in your ass? (Mark grunting) Awesome, huh? You get tough when you're outta here. You're gonna bleed out, boy! (suspenseful music) - Mark. - [Mark] Yeah? - You okay? - [Mark] My arm. - Let me see. - Hand me the gun. Hand me the gun. - What, what're you gonna do? - Two roads. (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) - Look at you over there. Shaking like a trapped rabbit. (suspenseful music) You know there's only one thing that separates us from the animal kingdom? One thing and one thing only. (suspenseful music) Revenge, your daddy killed my girl. We were gonna have a baby. He gunned her down and I watched her die. Now, it's your turn. (Toni whimpers) Because out here revenge is justice, and I'm fixing to get some. (suspenseful music) You can count on that. (Toni whimpering) (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) (Toni whimpering) (suspenseful music) (Toni whimpering) (suspenseful music) (Toni whimpering) (suspenseful music) (Toni whimpering) (suspenseful music) (gun firing) (Toni grunts) - Stop! (Cody laughing) - Dad, Dad, I'm in here! (gun firing) - Go on inside, old man. - Dad, there's a gun! (gun firing) - Cody, stop, you don't have to do this! This has nothing to do with her, all right, so just. (gun firing) - [Toni] There's a gun, duck! (gun firing) Dad, are you okay? You have to be okay. (suspenseful music) (gun clicks) (suspenseful music) - You're gonna make this easier for me, ain't ya? (Cody clicks tongue) (Cody laughing) - He's outside, okay? I'm gonna take him down there along the creek. He's probably gonna follow me. The second I do, I want you to take off. (leaves crunching) - Mark. (suspenseful music) - Put that gun down, and get the hell out of the cabin now, now! (suspenseful music) - So, is this uh, eye for an eye? Some kind of a bible thing? - Oh yeah, I had two quality bible reading years because of you when I was in prison. All human beings that are doomed lose their right to be redeemed. They must be put to death. Leviticus, chapter 27, verse 28 and 29. She was five months pregnant! She was unarmed. - I'm sorry. - You have kindled a fire in my anger that shall burn forever. Jeremiah, chapter 17, verse four. You remember when you shot me in my leg? (gun firing) (Dave screams) (suspenseful music) Hurts, don't it? (Dave grunting) Get on your knees, both of you. - [Dave] No, no, no! (suspenseful music) (Toni crying) - Daddy, Daddy, I couldn't save her. I couldn't save her. It was my fault, okay? It was my fault. I couldn't save her. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Daddy (crying). - That's enough, cop. Time to watch your daughter die. (Toni gasping) Eye for an eye. (suspenseful music) - [Man] No! (gun firing) (suspenseful music) (gun firing) (Toni crying) (suspenseful music) - You okay? - Yeah, my cousin's in a cabin downriver. - Everything's gonna be all right, Toni. It's gonna be all right.
