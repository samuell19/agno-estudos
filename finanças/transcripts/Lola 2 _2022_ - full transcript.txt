I just threw it in there with the rest of the stuff. - Lola. - Whoa. Hey Can I talk to you for a minute? Yeah, you good? Yeah, I'm good, just working on the next fight. You know how that go. But I wanted to let you know that you motivated me to continue to fight. My mother, she died of breast cancer a couple years ago. And, but she fought all the way to the end. I've honestly never seen anybody fight like my mother fought. And that reminded me of you. I mean, I just want you to keep doing what you're doing, because you're out here motivating people like me. And you don't even know it sometimes. I, yeah, you're right. I didn't. So I just wanted to let you know I'm watching, and the whole world is watching you. Keep it up. Thank you, man. I appreciate it. And hey, you looking good, you know? All right, you guys. I've brought y'all to the gym because I know y'all like boxing, right? You like boxing, right? All right. And you gonna know of the finger cells in three different elements, okay? So this girl will show you self defense, okay? Show you how to protect yourself and everything that you do, right? Wait, is that Lola? Hi! Oh my god, thank you guys so much! Wow. What a greeting! Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, too. Oh, we doing Thank you guys for coming. Thanks for having us. - Wow. Y'all look beautiful. - Wow. You are beautiful. Aw, thank you. I mean, you don't all look quite dressed for boxing. Oh, we can go. We can go. Okay, ladies, so Miss Lola has took time outta her schedule today to come and hear your stories. So, let's share. My name is Jessica. Hi, Jessica. Hi. Lola, Jessica wants to be a boxer also. Oh, okay. Why do you wanna be a boxer? To defend myself. Why do you feel like you need to defend yourself? From men who abused me in the past. Friends of my dad that he worked for, they would threaten me that they'll fire him if I don't do what they say. And that I'll lose my home and end up on the street. I'm so sorry to hear that. Hi, I'm Michelle. Lola, because of you, I got outta depression. And also because of you, now I know that I'm enough. Lola, meeting you today has made me realize anything is possible. Thank you. Watching you throughout the years has really inspired me to take my power back. Because when I was a little girl, my dad used to molest me, and it made me feel so worthless, and so scared all the time. But I'm not scared anymore because of you. So, thank you. Lola, this is my daughter, Lisa. She's so inspired by you. Lisa, don't be shy. Tell her how you feel. Stop it, mom. Okay, mom. Come on, Lisa. All right. Hi. You inspire me to go for my dreams. You motivate me to be the best that I can be. Wow. Thank you guys, for really sharing your stories. It takes a lot of courage to come to a group like this and speak your truth. It takes a lot of power within to stand here in front of others and share like that. I didn't know how to handle the feelings that I was feeling, and I too was abused. It made me feel powerless. Like I didn't know how to communicate or tell anyone what I was going through, because I wasn't like you. I didn't have the courage. I was not the Lola that you see here with you right now. My life was spiraling out of control. I was out with friends all the time, I was drinking, I had no purpose. And one day, went to this club, and all of a sudden, this guy came behind me into the ladies' room, and he caught me off guard, and he attacked me. And I didn't know what to do. I didn't know how to defend myself. I didn't have the tools. I wasn't equipped. He overpowered me. That stays with me every day. So how do you cope with it? That's a great question, Jessica. Boxing. Boxing saved my life, because it made me feel empowered. It made me feel strong. It made me feel like I can do anything. It made me fearless. It's because I've worked on me. I feel like a champion. That's how I was able to overcome all of it. That's what I want you guys to take away from this session here today. I'm so proud of each of you. I'm proud because you have the courage that I didn't have. So, if you're looking at me and I'm looking at you, I'm like, you're starting off better than me. So, I expect you to be better than me. Everybody say, "I'm a champion." I'm a champion. Ah. Say it like you mean it. "I'm a champion." I'm a champion! Say, "I am enough." I'm enough! That's right. You are. You are enough. Do you believe that? Yes. Okay, I'm sorry. I know. Y'all got me in here crying. This was not a part of the plan. Bring it in, bring it in. Bring it in. One, two. One, two. There we go. There we go. Move. Move. Gimme that four again. That four? The one, two, four, or just the four? Let's work on the one, two, four. All right, let's go. One more time. There we go. There we go. All right. Come on, Lola. Come on. Tag him, let's get it. Come on, head movement, foot movement, let's get it in. Come on, let's go. You punch, head movement, slide away. Slap for me. Come on, slap for me. Let's get it in. Four. Circle left, one, two, one, two. Yeah. One, two. One, two. Ah, no, Lola. Lola, what are you doing? She needs to move that head! No, she needs to move those feet. What have I been drilling since I've been here? Move your feet, move your feet, move your feet. Move your feet. Move your feet. Do I look like I'm laughing? The fight is tomorrow night. Stop. No, cause you asked for my help. I didn't ask for yours. Okay. And you two, go on over there and do it like I showed you. Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. You two, come closer. Yes, ma'am. Y'all supposed to be the best. - Definitely. - We the best. Then act like it. You can't play with them, either of them. Look, they need you, especially David. And I got my own family, my own responsibilities I gotta handle. Yeah. For y'all, you two gonna be here every day. We hear you. I hope so. - We got you, Sash. - We got you. - All right. - Got you. Now let's just win this fight! All right. Let's do this. Let's do this. Let's go. - Come on. - Let's go. Let's go. Ladies and gentlemen, it's go time. Introducing first, the challenger in the black corner, from Brooklyn, New York, 12 wins by KO, I present to you, Trina 'Doomsday' Jackson. And in the red corner, with an equally impressive amateur record of five wins by KO, zero losses, the reigning, defending Queen of the Ring, Lola Williams. You hit like a bitch. Stop running, fight me. Come on, Lola. You got this. Fight! Come on, change numbers on her. No more holding. She was on me, ref. Fight! You weak. I smell blood all over you. Back, back, back. One, two, three. Out. Out. Out. Medic. Medic. Medic. Lola, sit up and breathe. Breathe, Lola. Good. Breathe. Breathe in. And the winner by knockout, the new Queen of the Ring, Trina 'Doomsday' Jackso Yay! Yes. I'm the champ. This is my belt. I knew I could do it. I'm so happy right now. Yes. Yes, honey. And whose, whose, whose ass did you whoop? Lola who? I'm the champ now. It's about Trina. It's Trina's time. And nobody's gonna win this belt back from me. Amen. Can we say the champ is here, what? Doc. How's my baby girl? She's stable. She suffered a bit of tinnitus, nothing major. Tinnitus? What's that? She explained that she's a boxer, correct? Mm hmm. Well, she took quite a few tough blows to the head. Tinnitus is not really a condition, but a symptom. So many things could have gone wrong. She really should not have been fighting while pregnant. Pregnant? You didn't know. They don't know. How? Can we see her, please? Yes, but she specifically asked to see David first. Is he here? That's me, doc. Please come with me. Everyone, wait here momentarily. Well, I'll be damned. This some bullshit. Uh-uh. John, not right now. Come on, let's just wait. Let's wait. Wait. Hey. I can't believe I lost my title. That's the least of your worries right now. Your health is what matters. Least of my worries? David, I lost my belt. You'll get another shot, Lola. Your health comes first. Just one step at a time. I was supposed to go pro after that fight. You know that. Well, that's gonna have to be on pause for right now. The doc told me you're pregnant. Why didn't you say anything? I'm just as surprised as you are. Me, pregnant? I would've never thought in a million years I'd be pregnant. I asked him about aborting it. Without consulting me? Oh, David, it's my body. I get to do it what I please. You know, you can't be this selfish, Lola. It's my child, too. David, you know I can't have a baby right now. Where are you going? You know what? Why do you insist on doing selfish things, huh? This is serious, Lola. I'm serious. I'm serious about you, about us. This is not a game. I am not a game. I don't know your past, but if you'd just let me in, you will see that I would die for you. Ever since the moment I met you, I knew that you were the one for me. David. I love you, Lola. I love you. Lola. Do you love me? I mean, you know I've always been attracted to you. We've kind of had this Lola, just answer the damn question. Yes. I You do? Yes, I love you. You already Yes Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Oh my. Oh, what, what are you, what are you doing? Well, I, I was, I was gonna wait until after the fight, but, you know, well, it's no time like the present. Lola. Lola Williams. Will you marry me? Are you serious? Yes, I'm serious. I'm doing this because I love you. You really do. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Always. Okay. Ask me again. Okay. Lola Williams, will you be my wife? Yes? Yeah. Yes? Yeah. I will. Yes. Yes. Oh my Oh, I love you. Yeah, girl. She fell for everything I baited her with, the jab, the uppercut. I'm like, "Damn." But you know what? I think it took me too long to knock her out. Next time I fight her, I'ma knock her out in the first round. They gonna call me the knockout queen. Yo. Yo, you Trina. You one that knocked out Lola like it was nothing. Oh, you's a fan. Let's get you, let's get you a picture. I know what you want. I don't know, man. I heard she was pregnant. If she wasn't, Trina would've got them hands. You know what I'm saying? Don't say that. That's what they sayin'. What are you talking about? Who told you that lie? Everybody know. It's on social media. Social media don't know shit. Trina 'Doomsday', the greatest woman boxer ever. Don't ever disrespect me. You got it. I ain't got time today, sucker. Knock yo ass out. Damn. Yo. Supposed to be the happiest day of my life. We have come together today for this joyous occasion for Lola Williams and David Morehouse to join themselves together on this special, special day. And the bride and the groom have chosen to say their own vows. Lola. David Morehouse, thank you. It's because of you that I know what love is.

Thanks, guys. Hi. Hi. Are you guys familiar with the area and the architects? Yes, we are. Great. I'm sure you're gonna love the home. Thank you so much. Absolutely. So, this house was built in 2015. It offers a lot of natural sunlight in the inside, lots of storage space, and the second floor is gonna be a blessing for the baby. Let's go that way. So, I think you are going to love this kitchen area, because I know that you do a lot of hosting, entertaining, so we have our granite countertops, lots of cabinet space, oven here, stove top over this way. I know that you were talking about that stove top. So, we have that, and we have a wine cooler over this way. I mean, he does all the cooking. Oh, okay. I do. I do. What do you think? Can we even afford it? Let me worry about that. But you're the one who will be home most of the time, so it's whatever you want. Well, whatever we decide, we have to make it quick. It would be really hard trying to move with a baby. Yeah. I like it. Yeah? Yeah. Reminds me of the home I once grew up in. I could see two or three kids running around here, you know? Three? Yeah. You don't want more? I wanna focus on the one that we have. Of course. Mm. So? If you like it, I like it. Yeah? Yeah. Okay. We buying a house. Hey, baby girl. Hey, daddy. Oh, man. Baby, what's wrong? Is it the baby? Yeah. I'm gonna get the car. Oh, no, no, no. Dad, no. It's not like that. Whew. Thank the Lord. Phew. Mm. Everything is just moving so fast, you know? That's called growing up, baby girl. I know that. But I just would've never thought that I would've been the one to have a baby, and get married, and to a man? Hmm. I mean, don't get me wrong, I love David. But what if I'm not good enough? You know, I'm not used to seeing you like this. I know. Mama, I'm serious. I don't know that I can do this. You can. I was close to aborting it. I'm scared that I won't be a good enough mother for this child. And it's not funny. Well, aborting it, it's too late for that. Listen sweetheart, I understand how you feel, but at the end of the day, you made the decision. Now, neither your father nor I could tell you what to do. But you are a grown woman now. You will always be our baby, but Lola, now it's time for you to start taking responsibility. You're gonna be fine, baby. Yeah, I agree with your mother. I mean, look how far you've come. Yeah. I mean, you think we got this way overnight, but you know what saved us? Was time. Yes. So all you gotta do is just give yourself some time. But time heals all wounds. You understand, baby girl? Guess I'll give it time. That's it. Yep. You'll do well. Right? Yeah. Man. I don't know who's expecting. Yeah, I'm expecting one too. Y'all need help with the bill? Cause this hot as hell in here.

Needed to switch career paths. As a waitress? I have a daughter now, wanted to avoid losing anymore brain cells. True. That whole CTE stuff. I'll tell you, I have two boys myself.

You're still here. Okay, okay. I'll- You should leave. You should leave. Trina, shut up. I'll get the food right away. There's no reason to be irate. Y'all having a problem too? There's no reason to be irate, ma'am. I'll take care of it now. No reason. What, I'm hungry. He gave me no- She don't respect women. Get outta here. Go get her food. You still here. Trina, shut the fuck up. And ma'am, What? I will get your food. Calm down. Don't tell me to calm down. - Waitress, please - Why? What's the Why you gotta be all loud in here anyway? Just shut up. Why I gotta be all loud? You clearly need to make a different profession. Fuck you and your food! No, fuck you! I'll get your fucking food. Go right ahead, and I promise you, you won't be working after tonight. I am so sorry. She's new here. Look, we got you the best seat in the house, and your meal is on the house. Y'all need to double check on the people that y'all hiring because she's rude as fuck. - Please. - I will take care I think you should fire her. I'll take care of it. No, she does need to be fired. After everything that happened. - Okay. - Very much. Miss Cinthy, let me explain. Explain nothing. You cursed the customer. That's unacceptable. I know, but I'm sorry. It won't happen again. No, it won't happen again because you're fired. What? But you saw how rude she was. Yeah, I saw that, but you can't go around cursing people out because they're rude to you. Fuck. You gotta be above. Okay. All right. Can I at least finish the day? Like I need this job. You know that. I'm afraid not. You're not cut out for this kind of work. You need patience, a lot of patience, kindness. You're You're a killer. What you said to her? They landed, okay? They landed. What I need for you to do is consider getting back into the ring. Consider that. All right. What you got, Lola? All right, all right. Shit, I feel good. All right. Hm. Any new female fighters? They too pretty. So, nobody worth training? No one has the fire you had. Had. Ouch. You know, I was thinking about, you know, picking it back up again. What you think? Not with those abs, you won't. My incision is healed. I don't give a damn what they say. Routine surgery or not, they cut open your abdomen. They gotta be fast enough to hit me in the stomach first. Oh, they will be. Especially with all that weight you done put on you. I can burn this off. Forget it, Lola. You had a C-section, okay? By the time that fully heals, you'll be way past your prime. So you don't believe in me at all, huh? You know, Diane once told me about women having to prove to the world that we're human. What's your motto? Cause it seem like you don't believe in none of that shit. But I can't let nobody stop me from being who I'm supposed to be. Come on. Damn. What? You don't want anybody to stop you from being who you are. I just stopped your ass with one punch. That was a sucker punch. What do you think Trina is gonna do? Remember, I'm not gonna be able to be there for that. Go home, Lola. Your family is waiting for you. Don't, don't do this, Sasha. Sasha, don't do this. Shit. I need this. Lola who? I'm the champ. This is my belt. I knew I could do it. I'm so happy right now. It's Trina time. And nobody's gonna win this belt back from me. Why would you stop by the other night? You wanna start boxing again? Lola, that's just crazy. It's crazy to think I'm capable of doing anything else. Do you wanna end up in the hospital again? So you don't think I can take a hit? You know many times I've been hit throughout my life? I always get back up. It's what I do. I can't go through that again, Lola. Rushing you to the hospital was the scariest moment of my life. I can't, I can't do that again. Okay. All right. Do you remember when we first met? I was drifting around, getting drunk, getting myself into trouble. I had no real purpose before boxing. And you helped me with that. It's who I am, baby. Baby, it's not about you anymore. It's about us. What you do affects us all. You have to think about what's best for Lily. You don't think I think about what's best for Lily? Well, what do you think is best? Being home, being there, being safe. Being home. Okay, fine. If that makes you happy. It would. It would. Okay. Thank you. Yo, Ray, let me tell you one thing, okay? The kids of these days do not respect the history of boxing. You understand? I mean, if they don't know where they've been, how the hell they know where they go? You right, you right. I mean we got the great Charles Burley and the Black Murderers' Row. You got a kid that you training that reminds me of him. Exactly. Then you got Willie Pep - Yes, sir. - And the great Rocky Marciano You right. And my favorite, the great Jersey Joe Walcott. Cake walk, baby. Yes, sir. Lola! - Hey, hey. - What's up? - Oh my goodness. - Big trouble, little trouble. What's up? Oh, please. Hey, Ray. Hey, hey, hey. - See you, homeboy. - What's going on? - See you, homeboy. - Good, how y'all doing? We good. We good. Ah, I miss you guys. You done brought the future champ to see us. That's right. You ready to start training? I am. That's why I'm here. Does David know? David wouldn't approve, Ray. He's still upset about how I went behind his back last time. Damn, man. Look it, man. He's just worried about this little bundle of joy here, girl. You made a champion. Let me talk to him. I don't know that that would work, Ray. He doesn't see me for the fighter that I am. He only sees me as a mother and a wife. The only way I can prove I'm wrong, guys, is if I beat Trina. I need your help, come on. What about that stomach? I've been working out every day. - Hmm. - 500 crunches a day. For the past month, I have been at it, guys. Come on, man. I need you. Well, that's what it's gonna take, but I'm gonna tell you one thing. Trina hasn't tested any one twos as to that stomach. If Trina tears those incisions in your stomach, David is going to never forgive me, ever. I don't want to agree with him, but I have to. Look, you guys know me. You know me. I'm gonna train for this fight with or without you. Now, I'd prefer to do it with you or I'm gonna do it on own. And run the risk of getting hurt. Wow. I guess, little Lily, we don't have any choice. Yeah. Lola is the best. Come on. Better than all the rest. - What I'm talking about. - There's my right girl. That's what I wanna hear. Get it. Let's get it going. We gonna do it. We gonna do it. Ray, come on, Ray. Come on, Ray. Come on, Ray. Fine. Whatever. - Thank you, man. - Whatever. All right. Let's get to training. - Let's get to training. - All right, let's do it. What's up, champ? What's up coach? Nothing much. Just enjoying this delicious, nutritious banana. You should eat more of these. Okay? I heard a new song today. It's called word on the street. ♪ Word on the street That Lola's back in the gym training, again. What that mean? What that means is, her whole entire crew's talking a lot of shit, said, "She coming to beat your ass." And they hit the ass hard. "Whoop your ass," that's what they said. Well, me and you was both there. I beat her already. Yeah. But you know what everybody's saying about you beating her. They said that she was pregnant in the ring, and that's the only reason why you did beat her. And that's confirmed. Well, pregnancy part. I beat her fair and square. Rather she was pregnant or not, I still would've beat her. Okay. So what you gonna do about this now? You gonna let this ride all this talk? Or are you gonna get back in the ring? What's up? You sound like you with them. I got her. I got it. Don't worry about it, coach. I'll beat her again, just like I did before. All right, we'll see about that. They don't call me the J.Lo of boxing for nothing. I could either take you there or drop you down. So, let's see if you beat her ass. Eat a banana. Lola, Lola, Lola. How's my girl? Good. Me check your temperature. I gotta make sure you ready. You understand? I'm ready. I hope that serious face is about determination 'Sup? To totally annihilate, Let's get 'em. Your competitor.

That's it. Woo! And five. Yeah! Six Hi. What's going on? Nothing. Just tired. Lily kept me up all night. I've known you for a long time, right? And you know I know when something's wrong. It's Lola. Everything good? I don't know. I don't know what's going on from that. Go talk to her. I would if I can see her. We live in the same house, but we barely even cross paths. We don't even sleep in the same bed anymore. I know that's hard. But you need to go talk to your wife. Yeah, man. It ain't that easy right now. Listen, listen, you can't stand here punching this bag. Go find your wife, go talk to your wife. I know both of y'all. I know y'all love each other. Go work this out, and gimme a call when you find your wife. Gimme a call, all right? Go find her. All right. All right. All right. All right. Lola! Lola. Babe. David. What are you doing home? Hey. Hey. What are you guys doing here? We're here taking care of Lily like we do every day. You guys always come this early? This is the time that Lola goes to work. Work? Yeah. When did Lola get a second job? - Like two weeks ago. Right. - Couple of weeks ago. Where's she working? I don't know. Some bar, sports bar or something. Sports bar? This is unbelievable. Thank you. Come on, come on, come on. Ah, man. Hey. Stopped by your job tonight. Yeah, I got off early. So, I just wanted to come by and get some work in. Sorry I didn't call you. You go anywhere after the bar? What's with all the questions, David? Curious about my wife's life. I am your husband, right? Right. You're my husband, not my dad. Might as well be, with you acting like a child and everything. And what is that supposed to mean? I spoke to your manager. Okay, so I got fired. Months ago, Lola. Jesus. Why didn't you tell me? And what good would that have done? All you would've tried to do is convince me to stay at home. And what's wrong with that? Because I'm not a fucking dog, David. And don't get pissed at me because I still have a life. I'm coming here pissed because you know what? I'm not part of that life. I'm trying to build something with you, something for us. Well, I can't be who you want me to be. Who do you want to be, huh? Who? Where were you these past few months? I've been training. For what? For Trina. Lola, are you outta your freaking mind? See, this is what I'm talking about. You don't support me. You're gonna get yourself killed. One hit to the stomach and it's over. It's over, Lola. I can take her! Do you want your daughter to grow up without a mother? Now why would you say some shit like that? No, Lily's not gonna grow up without me. What is this? Is this for your fucking pride? This is not about pride. I don't understand why you don't get that. Then what is it? Huh? Things have changed, Lola. No. See, you have changed, David. I'm still who I am, and I can't let you or anybody else stop me from doing what I wanna do, from being who I wanna be! I won't do it. You won't stop? Not for me? No. And Lily? David, I'm doing all of this for Lily. Is that what you think this is? You are so selfish. I won't stay here and watch you kill yourself. Kill myself? You just don't believe in me. David. Then don't. Now, Whoa. You look like you training to get back in the ring again. Oh, don't worry, I'm not gonna train you. You're getting a little too fat anyway. Come on, stop. What's wrong with you? I don't wanna talk about it. Fine. Sulk. Lola's boxing again. Once a fighter, always a fighter. Oh my God. You knew. I knew. I can't believe you. You're my family. You're my aunt. Why wouldn't you tell me? It's because it's what she needs right now. Like it or not, it's what she needs. And you choose her over your own nephew? I choose to believe in her. You have no idea. It's been so long since I've seen a female boxer this passionate. The circumstances may have changed, but she's a fighter, David, she's a fighter. Does Ray know too? West? I can't believe you guys. - Oh, come on. - You know what? Don't let me interrupt your little fight club. Oh, come on, David. David. Hey! Uh-uh. Don't you walk away from me when I'm talking to you. Now, I may not be your mother, and I don't care how big you got, but I will clean knock you the fuck out. Do you understand? Now, you stay right here, and you finish this conversation with me. Not this time. You're adorable. You're so beautiful. Thank you, for making me better. I love you so much. And you're all mine. Oh, I love you. Hey. Hey. Careful. Careful. I got it. Okay. Take her with me. Well, don't you think she should be with her mother? She should be. But you have other priorities. David. Gonna take some time off of work. Good luck with everything. David. David, please don't do this. Please don't. Ladies and gentlemen, we are now moments away from the main event of the evening. How's everyone enjoying themselves? What? I can't hear you. So, before we get started, I would love to bring the founders out of Double Knockout Promotions, who created the Queen of the Ring Amateur Boxing Tournament, to come and say a few words. All right, now. So excited to be here tonight. Seeing all the enthusiasm in the seats literally warms my heart. Do you guys remember the Double Knockout Girls? We knocked each other out. Do you guys remember that? Oh, wow. They remember. I mean, that night the capacity was for 500. We filled the seats with over 900 people, and then we took our money, put it together, and decided to open up a gym for young women, so they can go out and box and just have a safe space. We are number one in the country at selling out boxing arenas, and we are females. Give it up. Don't act like you don't know. Give it up! Are you ready to rumble? Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for coming out to this highly anticipated fight. In the red corner, we have the challenger, fighting out of Diane's Boxing Academy, with an amateur boxing record of five wins and one loss, with five wins by way of knockout, Lola Williams. And in the black corner, fighting out of All Elite Boxing Club, from Brooklyn, New York, with an undefeated 12 and oh record, all by knockout, the reigning, undefeated Queen of the Ring, Trina 'Doomsday' Jackson. Fighters ready? Fight! Come on, Lola. Let's go. Let's go. Lola is an outstanding fighter from the outside. Look at that lightning footwork already put to use. Come on, change levels on her. Let's go, Lola. Get in, get in. Come on. Trina just throws her clear across the ring. Oh! Lola definitely felt that one. That's the bell to end an aggressive round one. I'll tell you, if the fight is anything like this first round, we are in for a treat. Come on, we got this. Come on. Come on, Lola. I need you to pace yourself. All right? I need you to move around. Why is there a round two? You supposed to bend and knock that bitch out. Do you need me to get in here and fight this fight for you? Cause I will.

That ain't even a knockdown. Don't let that knockdown bother you. You understand? You got this. You understand me? He not coming, is he? Don't worry about that. I need you to get your head in the game. All right? I need you to jab. I need you to move. We can do this. Get her, Lola. Come on, to the chair. Keep moving. Yeah, that's it, Lola. Oh! That was a hard right, right there to the chin. You gone pulverize that bitch. If I got to come back in here again, girl. Now do it. Okay. I wouldn't wanna feel those hits from Trina. Whoa Lola lands a crazy body shot. Yeah, she did. Come on, you got it. Let's go. Trina answers back. Oh. Whoa. I gotta tell you, this has been a dog fight between these two champions. Clap that bitch. Come on, Lola. I cannot believe how close that it is. It's been blow for blow all night. What the hell is going on out there? Huh? What is this shit? You got this bitch flipping on you, look at your eye. Why does your eye look like that? She hit me, shit. Shit, but you let her hit you. Why the fuck you letting her hit you?

Don't nobody like Shaq's feet. Go in there, whip that bitch in. Trina is controlling this round. Hands up. Come on, Lola. Saved by the bell. She really was. And looks like we're headed to the eighth and final round. Lola, what are you doing? What is going on? She's just so strong. What have we been doing this all for? Where's that Warrior Spirit? Forget about doing it for everybody else. You gotta do this for yourself. You gotta do it for Lola. Hey baby, don't quit now. Okay? This is your legacy for Lily to follow, okay? Go out there and turn it all back, baby. I love you. Lola is the best. Better than all the rest. Lola is the best. Better than the rest. You better put them arms up. Keep them arms up.

Goes down from a crazy left hook. Are you serious? Two, three, four. Five, six. No, no wait. Trina is back on her feet with only a few seconds left of this final round. They are really gassed. We are done. And that's the bell. They went the distance in this championship fight. Hey. Hey, girl. You fought one hell of a fight tonight. So did you. Where's your team? I probably don't have a team no more, but, but listen, I wanna apologize for crashing your wedding, and saying all that stupid shit that I said. Oh man, that's all in the past. We both did a lot of growing because of this fight. Yeah. And because of what you said, caused this big ass event. And this is the amateur fight. You know, we all fucked up in amateurs. This will definitely make headlines. Yes. And we did that. You definitely earned my respect, Lola. Truce. My girl. Wow, what an incredible match.
