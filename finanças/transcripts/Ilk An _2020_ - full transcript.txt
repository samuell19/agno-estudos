A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES [thunder rumbling] DO NOT ENTER [dog barking] WARNING! DANGER [doorknob rattling] [adult Işık] How are you? How's life? Are you happy? With yourself? With everything? How many years has it been? So much has happened. Births, weddings, funerals... without each other. But we were the start of it all. Just being ourselves. Do you still cross the line? Are you still the rule-breaker? Or are you just another brick in the wall? It still feels unreal, the things we went through. What were we? Us. Our gang. "The worst." That's what they called us.

You should be ashamed of yourself. Trading homework, you little shit! Hey, hey listen, okay? It's not a big deal. It's really good for the entire school. This way, everyone's a winner. Fuck off! [crowd cheering] Come on, let's go! Get open! Yeah, baby! [referee whistles] - [Kerem] How was that not a foul? - It's nothing. - Can't you see? He pushed me! - Play on. [Kerem yells] I will fuck you up! [players shouting indistinctly] Get off of me! Don't touch me! Get off! I'm gonna fuck you up! [coach] Are you a moron? Is this the first time you've ever been fouled? I don't give a shit if you're the star player! You're off the team. - Get out of my face! - [Kerem grunts] [grunts] [Eda] You're so hot. [Tarik] Someone's gonna hear us. [Eda] No, they won't. Everybody's outside. [Tarik] You sure? [Necdet] Mr. Tarik! Necdet, we were just... - Just what? What, Mr. Tarik? What? - [Tarik] Please, sir. I can explain... [Necdet] I'm not interested in your explanations. Pack your things, and get the hell out of my school! Disgusting. [woman] God, look at that creep. Poor guy. What's that? He wrote me a farewell letter before he left. On pink paper. Anyway, what are we doing after school? [tram bell dinging] In philosophy, an ideal intellectual entity... I was hoping you wouldn't show up. Like you had died or something. Not yet, unfortunately. [Ayşe] Close the door, please. We haven't covered much, but I'll give you the notes on what you missed. Sinan, I watched this movie last night. It was so romantic. I think you'd like this one. Please don't. No, hey. Kevin Costner is in it. I've always thought he's such a sweetheart. He plays a retired athlete. It's not like the ones you normally get to see, but, you know, the houses and everything in the movie were just so beautiful. All right, guys, listen up. I can see how very excited we all are today. We all support our debate team, and we wish them the best of success. You will be missing your first two periods. And instead, you will get to watch the debate competition in the auditorium. How fun. Of course, they've decided to bring their own students, so I expect you all to behave. It's our responsibility to host them in the best possible way that we can. Whether we win or lose, we are going to do so with grace and honor. - It's great to see you both, gentlemen. - [Necdet] A pleasure. - I feel a victory coming. - [chuckles] Oh, yeah? You sure about that? [indistinct greetings continue] - [chatting indistinctly] - [both laugh] [Osman] Hello, everyone! Welcome to our distinguished school. I want to tell you about a little game I like to play. A game in which everybody wins. I'm giving one to two odds on a tie. We win, it's a triple. You win, it's a 3.5. - I'm taking all payments up front. - [all clamoring] - Where the hell is Sinan? - We don't know where he could be. Why did we let him join the team in the first place? He might know a lot, but it won't matter if he doesn't show up. He'll be here. - Yavuz, go and find out where he is. - Yes, ma'am. [Ayşe scoffs] Pain in the ass! - Hey, man. Where does this go? - Huh? [Yavuz] I don't know. Can you move? I'm busy! - Just tell me where to put this. - Put it wherever you like. I don't care. - Fine. I'll just leave it here, bitch. - [Yavuz groans] - [man] What's going on? - [Yavuz] Help! [man] Are you okay? [Necdet] Please, if everyone can take their seats, the debate is about to begin. 13TH HIGH SCHOOL DEBATE COMPETITION Debate's starting. Bets are closed. [Necdet] Unfortunately, our sound system is down, which means we have to continue without the use of any microphones. And for that, I apologize. Please enjoy the debate. Hurry up, ladies. Eda, what are you doing out here? Go in the auditorium. Yeah, I'll get there. Go! Eda? What's up? Uh, not much. Why don't you go get us some coffee? - But-but... - [Eda] I'll watch over the booth. Don't worry. Go fetch us some coffee, and then we can chat a little bit. Well, okay, then. I'll get us some coffee. Be right back. Yeah, yeah, no rush. Don't worry about it. All right... [Ayşe] First of all, I would like to welcome you once again. Our topic is "individual vs. society." Let's start with team blue. İSTANBUL ULUCINAR HIGH SCHOOL The individual is more important. Although we can't deny the basic fact that in our society, it is absolutely necessary to raise children. We... Don't stop. Uh, right. Where was I? Uh, first of all, we can't deny the basic fact that in our society, it is absolutely necessary... [audience murmurs in confusion] [man] What's going on? Society is... - Hey, they're trying to rig this shit! - Hang on. It's just an accident. This isn't fair! It's not an accident. You have to call off the bets. They didn't even get a chance to talk. They're distracted. [students murmuring] [Ayşe] Kids, it's important that we stay calm, and let's stay in our seats. Eda. Of course it's you. Are you trying to drive me completely insane? I am so fed up with you! It's no big deal. Don't be mad. It was just a joke. Enough! Find yourself a seat in the auditorium, and be quiet. I'm going to deal with you when this is over. Can you just go one day without causing any trouble? - [Eda] It's all yours. - [boy] Eda? Uh... Don't ever leave your post again! You understand? Move! [Işık] The general welfare of society plays a critical role in elevating the individual. From this perspective, we can comfortably say that society is more important. The individual is simply one part of a greater whole. Thus, with the absence of society as a whole, the individual loses its function. To provide an example, uh... let's talk about an individual who voluntarily isolates himself. For you see, this individual, after removing all connections from society... When it's your turn, the lights are just fine. Shut up! We didn't do this shit! Dude, you're being crazy. I never play dirty. Bullshit! What's going on? What are they fighting about? We had a bet, but they keep playing dirty. Right, they're up to something. How do you know? I heard. They're trying to play you. Bro! They totally rigged it! [teacher] Shh! Settle down! [Işık] Let's think about an individual who voluntarily isolates himself. All right. [Işık] This individual, after disconnecting from society, begins to lose social skills that he has acquired. This gives us a very clear picture of society's importance. It is society that makes an individual an individual - and gives a person a sense of meaning. - Who threw that? The fuck's wrong with you? I'm sorry, what's that? Who the hell do you think you are, man? Talking back to me? You're on my fucking turf! [students shouting] ♪ I started walking ♪ Break them up!

[Necdet] You are absolutely right, sir. Let me promisethat... [inspector] I haven't seen anything like this in my entire career. That was an absolute frenzy. I'm disqualifying your school. You're banned from this debate and all future debate tournaments. - You're out. Got it? - Yes, of course, sir. As you wish. - You and your school are done for good. - Well, have a good day, sir. [Osman] What's taking them so long? Just call us in and get it over with. This is bullshit. Are you looking at me? No, I wasn't. I was just thinking. Did you break the amp? Yeah... What about you? Nothing. Just routine stuff. I was going to win big if you hadn't messed with the lights. Uh, do you think I care? What did he do? [Kerem] Set the curtain on fire. [chuckles] Our student representative is here. - Işık, how are you, my dear? - I'm doing very well, thank you, sir. Sorry, sorry, traffic was a nightmare. [Necdet] Well, since Ms. Distas has decided to show up, I think it's time we get started. Have them come in one at a time. I thought the light show spiced things up a bit. I think everybody had fun. Get out. All right, Kerem... You were the one who broke the amp. Or rather, you broke it by smashing it on your classmate's head. Well, it was completely random. It could've happened to anyone. The amp? Well, that thing was pretty old. We needed a new one anyway. You'll need a new spine after I'm done with you. You nitwit! [sighs] Can you believe this? Now, ladies and gentlemen, amidst the chaos, I was able to keep some of the down payments. How about I buy the school a new amp, and we forget this ever happened. - [Necdet groans] - [Osman] Hm? There you go. This is what we're dealing with. We need to act! I refuse to defend myself. 'Cause defending oneself is an admission of guilt up to a certain point. It's basically saying I could have done it, but I didn't. What are you rambling about? You almost burned down the school! Are you familiar with Schrödinger's cat? There's no such thing as "almost." Until the moment the school is burned down, it is both burned and not burned. And in this case, since the building clearly hasn't been burned down, - do you understand what I mean... - That's enough! This is absurd! [Necdet] He's testing our patience. This has gone too far. Get out. Now! I hate these kids. Someone always wants to be merciful so we can't expel them. Unfortunately, a majority vote is not enough. It has to be unanimous. I believe we'll have unanimous consent this time. Twelve out of 12, right? Well, aren't we? [adult Işık] We had nothing to do with each other back then. We weren't even friends. It feels so weird to even think about. What do you mean you're not on board? We got kicked out of the tournament. What else do you want? Yes, but shouldn't we look at this matter from the perspective of the students? Look, we're talking about denying them a formal education... Yeah, so what? How can you say that? They'll never even get a high school diploma. I do not care at all! This is their fault. It's not like they're going to contribute to society, are they? They'll all be in jail before they even turn 20. They're evil brats. I agree. Especially Eda. I'm sorry, but her mother gave birth to a witch. [Ayşe] Also Sinan and Kerem. Those two are insane. I'd agree with that. Kerem is the worst of all. That kid scares me. He's seriously dangerous. You're making this situation very personal, and you shouldn't. It's too late! Those four kids come in every day and make our lives a living hell! That's what I'm trying to tell you. I feel like our decision is not based on this one incident, but on everything they've ever done to us. Why should I care? Those kids are a plague on this school. We've gotta get rid of them for good. Do you hear what I'm saying? We're not being objective. This is not the constitutional court. And I agree with Mr. Refik. Personally, I think we should stop dragging this matter and move straight to voting. Ms. Distas, please don't make this harder than it has to be. Come on. Let's vote. That's it. Hold 'em up. Burcu, you're feeling guilty for no reason. There's no need to. Mm-hmm. Let's get 'em this time. Keep 'em up. Come on. - Are we really getting expelled? - Of course not. I'm here every month. They need to vote unanimously, but they never do. She's right. Last month, I got through with two votes. Two votes? That's really close. My best score is four against eight. So, four people felt so sorry, they let me stay. But this time... It'll be fine. What did we even do? Goddammit. Here, hazelnuts. [Kerem] I'll take some. [Eda] Thanks. [soft romantic song playing] You bastards will get what's coming to you. But not today. Eleven to one. Eleven to one. You got away again, you pathetic delinquents. I couldn't expel you this time. But I will. In fact, if I had one more day left alive, I'd spend it trying to get you all expelled. You hopeless sociopaths! Another narrow escape. Eleven to one. I wonder who saved us. Look who it is, our student representative. She's the head of the honorary committee. She sits in on all of the disciplinary boards. What? What are you doing? What's going on? Sinan! Sinan. Who was the one that voted for us? What? Someone saved us. We want to know who it was. That's secret. I can't tell you that. Come on, don't be like this. Just tell us. - Eda, really, I'm not allowed... - Tell us! [gasps] Distas. It was Ms. Distas. They tried to expel you all, but she refused to consent and stood up for you. So she's the reason we didn't get expelled. - It's just... - [Kerem] What? [Sinan] Stop yelling. She's getting flustered. Ms. Distas is really committed. She didn't want anyone getting expelled. [adult Işık] Those were the times when standing out meant being punished. If you're different, too bad. Just be normal, ordinary. Burcu wasn't aware of anything. It was only her conscience. Her trying to be fair. Having a sense of justice was more important to her than just about anything. ♪ Where do I come from? Where am I going? ♪ ♪ Where am I?

Oh, yeah. Hey. Anything I should know about? [girls chatting indistinctly] What is it? [imperceptible] [imperceptible] [Kerem] What? [boy in distance] Sinan! Sinan! Come here! Hurry up! Shit. [Sinan] What's up? Ms. Distas is being reassigned. She's leaving in two months. They'll definitely expel our asses now. [Burcu] Finally. I wanted this appointment so badly. Congratulations. I think this will be a great step in your teaching career. [Burcu] Thank you. Sir, you're going to leave those kids alone when I'm gone, aren't you? Of course not! I'm kicking them out. [Burcu] You are? Yeah. A red card! [chuckles] Sir, I'm begging you. Oh, I've waited long enough. I'm doing it. [chuckles] Well, then... I'll postpone my relocation for a whole year. Come on, now. You know, you... You're being ridiculous. Okay, I won't. Promise me? Yes. Maybe if we can just behave and not end up in front of the board again... [Eda scoffs] Yeah, right. Every single teacher hates my guts. They'd expel me if I looked at someone the wrong way. - Especially after what I did. - You mean banging the teacher? Watch what you say, or I'll break your goddamn jaw. Oh, yeah? Guys, can we just focus for a second? This is serious. Shithead got the news. I can't waste more time with you. I'm gonna talk with Ms. Distas. We're neighbors. She borrows sugar from my mom. Don't worry, Eda. He promised me he won't go after you when I leave. You sure? Mm-hmm. Turns out Ms. Distas is an idiot. She says Mr. Karakis promised not to go after us. - Promised? Karakis? - [Eda] He'll expel us for sure. - Hey, you gonna talk to Ms. Distas? - [Eda] Yeah, like I report to you. Uh-oh. What now? You just gonna keep sending your little nerds? We need to do something. [Eda] Who's "we"? Everyone should save their own ass. No. In dire times, people in the same situations need to unite. So let's do it. All we have is each other. Eda, those girls you hang out with would leave you in a heartbeat. Kerem, we saw how much your team stood up for you. [Sinan] Such insightful observations. What about me? I don't give a fuck about getting expelled. If you're expelled now, the name Karakis will haunt you for the rest of your life. Will you be happy knowing that this asshole Karakis was the person that determined your future? This shithead? [knock on door] Make that 12 lahmacuns, and I want six of them spicy. - Come on in. - [Osman] Ayran, too. Of course. I gave you the address, right? Okay, bye. So convenient. [Sinan] You have quite the appetite. - It's gonna be crowded. - [Sinan] What do you mean "crowded"? [knock on door] Let's just get this over with, shall we? Let's wait for everyone. Move, Sinan. [Osman] Make sure to use a lot of lemon. Pass the salt. - Come on! - One sec. Mm, this lahmacun is so nice and crispy. I know. Roll it up like this. - Hey, are you having any? - I don't think so. Ugh. Do you really live here all by yourself? My mom and dad both have other families. So they left me our old house. They're seriously fine with you living all alone, in this house with no adult supervision? There is an adult. My grandpa. - [Osman] I'll take this one. - [Kerem] Go for it. Oh, wow. There's actually someone over there. - Are you sure he's alive? - He's always like that. We really cut it close this time, guys. We would've been fucked if it weren't for Ms. Distas. I don't normally like teachers, but she's actually pretty nice. I guess she's nice. Tough, too. But she's naive. She desperately wants to be a good person, and she has too much faith in people. Hey, let's just focus on solutions. Now, let's find a way out of this. Let's beat up Karakis. But like really rough him up. Like break his arm. Or put him on payroll. Make him one of us. Oh, wow. Such brilliant ideas. How do you balance with those giant brains in your head? Just forget about Karakis. What we need to do now is focus on Ms. Distas. Get her transfer revoked. That's our only way out. [Sinan] Hmm. If she gets married, she can stay in whatever city she wants. So she has to marry someone in Istanbul. So one of us proposes to her? Oh, yeah, she'd totally marry you. I'm sure her dream is to marry some lame-ass high school student. Wanna get hit? Sure. Why not? Ms. Distas is a romantic. She needs to fall in love first. Oh, wait, wait, that's it! We'll make her fall in love. How do we do that? Love is overrated. You guys can chat about it, but leave me out of it. All I know about love... if someone loves a person who doesn't love them back, then they're just trapped, you know? It's confusing and unnecessary. They'll love you if you give them what they want. If they don't, they'll leave you. And you feel like total shit. That's the point. Love is about self-interest. If you give them what they want, they stay, but the moment you stop, they leave. It's a stupid game, that's all. Bravo! You're all such experts on the matter. Love is fucking stupid. It's not for us. [Osman] I agree. It's dumb. Well, since none of us believe in love, we're going to find someone who does. But we'll need help. We'll make her fall in love, she'll get married, and settle down here. And the four of us get to graduate. Okay, deal. But who are we going to get to help us out? We don't know shit about love. You know very well who we're going to get. - Oh, God! You can't be serious! - [Kerem groans] LOVE IN CHAINS - DOMINIC BENDEL [soft romantic song playing] [Kerem] Hey, get out. We need to talk. What about? What are you guys doing? - Sit down. - Don't touch me! Oh, my God, can you... - Relax. Sit down. - Let go! Sinan, can you say something to them? Leave me out of it. - What is wrong with you? - Sit still for a sec. - You're scaring her. - It's okay. We won't hurt you. Işık, listen... Listen, honey... Ms. Distas is going away. No, she can't leave. I love her so much. Then you should help us. Romance is what you know best. We have to make her fall in love. Otherwise, she'll leave. Ms. Distas is going away. I have so many fond memories. You know I'm going to miss her, too. We're talking about making something beautiful happen. This is good for all of us. - [startles] - [Sinan] Don't worry, they won't bite. Though I'm not so sure about this one. Hey, cool it. Please. Come on. Will you do it? Okay, I'll help you guys out. Yeah! Told you. Besides, it really is what I know best. And plus, we get to spread love, right? Yeah, you're so right. First, we need to find a candidate. That guy always has wet hands for whatever reason. Is he always in the bathroom, or is it something else? [speaking indistinctly] - [Işık] How about him? - Maybe he's the man of Burcu's dreams. That guy's a dick. Total asshole. It won't work. No way! ISTANBUL TEPEBAŞI HIGH SCHOOL Is there anyone else it could be? We're out of options. It's useless. [sighs] Found him.
