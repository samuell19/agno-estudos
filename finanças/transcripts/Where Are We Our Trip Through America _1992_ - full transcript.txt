Where are we? -The town square of Yanceyville. What's it called? -Town square of Yanceyville, North Carolina. Yanceyville? -Mm-hm. Can you tell me about the town? -I don't know much about it. It just-- it's just small. Where you from? -I'm from Providence. Where's that? Oh, Providence, Rhode Island? -No. Providence, North Carolina. It's about five miles from here. We set out to take a trip outside of our world, the one where we feel comfortable, and to make a film about strangers we met along the way. -Ah! I work for Old Dominion. In Temple Hill. What's Old Dominion? It's a cemetery up in Roanoke, Virginia. What's the most important thing you have to keep in mind when you're digging a grave? -Just don't get hit by the backhoe. When you're digging it. We were two gay men from San Francisco. We chose to travel through the South. It seemed so foreign to us yet so American. And then make our way home. Where are we? Rocky Mount. Seems like a nice neighborhood. -It's boring up here. Yeah? Where would you rather be? I'd rather be in New York. It's violent, and I like violent. -Mmm. We're from California. -Y'all drove all the way out here to see a real rainbow, sir? Yeah? -Mmmm. Gosh! We set out just after the Persian Gulf War. We had the money to wander, with our film crew, for 18 days. We had no idea what to expect. But for me, the best part of travel is surprise. So where are we? -Eh we're at Rumley's restaurant-- -Morrisville-- -In Morrisville-- At Rumley's-- What happens around here? Not a whole lot. -Well, we got curb service...and, um, you can go inside to eat if you want to. What do you guys do for fun around here? -Around Morrisville? Cruise Collin-- Cruise around or go to another city -Cruise Collinsville or go downtown with it. That's-- where I know all the girls are. -Yeah, where all the girls are we go. The race is always big, Morrisville Speedway. What kind of races? NASCAR. -Uh, NASCAR. NASCAR. -NASCAR. -NASCAR. Mmm, speedway. We don't know what that is. -You don't know what NASCAR speedway is? Oh. Stock car racing. -Stock car, racing. -Go on back? I gotta-- I gotta go wait on a car. -Yeah. You need a pad? What's your-- what do you know about-- what's your image of people from San Francisco? -Well, uh... I guess... depends, cause sometimes it's more that-- the faggish image. You know, that's just, the local image. That's what...a lot of people think. You know. I don't really think that, cause I don't really know anybody from San Francisco, so I can't...rightly say that. You know. -All the southerners eat pinto beans and raw onions. Sounds delicious. -Dinner isn't complete, they have to have their pinto beans and raw onions. What about the food here? -No idea, I was desperate tonight. I was hungry. But we ate at Best Western, and that used to be the Holiday Inn, it's 220 North right outside of Collinsville, and the food there is good. Are you from here? -Not originally, but I spent-- unfortunately, spent most of my life here. -And you folks are going through the country doing this? Yep. -Good. What do you think we should ask people? -Beg your pardon? -What do you think we should ask people, when we're talking to them? -Oh. Eh, I don't know what, you just-- you might not wanna ask them what I would. What's that? -Yeah. If you tell them you from California, you might already ask them some real nice questions, you know. They might run you back-- might run you back to California. No, we-- we appreciate people from other countries. -I love everybody. You know. I have six daughters and one son, so might-- I lose my son. Three years ago. And so, all the young people called me Mom around there, when I was back there sittin' in the parking lot. So I got more sons than I birthed really. What happened to your son? -Well, he drank a lot. And he got stabbed twice, in the... Oh, I'm sorry. Got stabbed here, and he was in intensive care, then they just stabbed him in the back with a 007, he never got over with. So that's kin, you know that was sad. Because he lived about two hours after he left my house, then he died. What are you afraid of? -Nothing. Well what good, would it do to be afraid?! I can't whoop nobody. And I think a lot of people like me cause I like everybody. -Anything can happen. This world is wicked. It's crazy out here. And I'm riding with my little boy, uh, we're alone, we're black, riding around the South, OK? And, anything could happen. But, you know, there's a trust that I have in God that we're protected. So we're from San Francisco. Have you ever met anyone from San Francisco before? -Naw. No I haven't. I've heard it's a beautiful place, San Francisco. What are your images of it? - Well as-- - as far as what I hear? Yeah. -Um, it's the gay capital of the world. That's, you know, that's basically all you hear about it, really. Um, I hear it's a pretty place. And it's really beautiful-- What do you think of that? -About what, being the gay capital of the world? Well, I don't have any desire to go-- to go there. You know, or to have my kids around that type of, um, environment. You know, because...because of what I believe. You know, um. If I did go there, I'd go there witnessing, and trying to help some-- some people, who are into that, to get out of it. You know. -When we moved to Tennessee, my wife moved back to New England. 13 years ago. And I've just finished raising my kids, and I'm, uh, shifting into second gear and kinda getting on with life as a solo flier. She didn't like it down here? -Uh... I wouldn't-- I don't know it's that she didn't like it down here, I think we came down here maybe so that we could get divorced. Out of our families, and, you know, I think a lot of people do that kind of thing. Go somewhere to throw up, or do the bad things in your life and get straightened out, and I think that's what she had to do. What's your biggest fear? -My biggest fear? Well, I been shot at, to tell you the truth. Yeah. I've had that done to me. And it scared the daylights out of me. Uh, I've got-- What happened? -Uh, I said something to this person and, um, something that he done. And I just mentioned it and he took his .22 uh--uh-- semi-automatic and kinda like shot it up above my daughter and I's head and I kinda like had to shove her down into my water bed to keep from getting shot. That was the biggest fear in my life and it scared me. Very, very deeply. And I never, ever want to go through that experience ever again. What did your parents do? -My dad, he's deceased, and he did real good. Raised three children, by himself. My mother, I don't never see her. I never seen her since I was a child. So... What do you remember about your mother? -I don't remember her. I don't really uh-- the things that-- that I do remember, I don't want to remember. So I just block it out. She did some terrible things. And I, I'll never forget it. And I just-- I just don't even want to talk about it either. Can I have your attention please? We have just crossed over into the Central Time Zone, please set your watches back one hour. Thank you. I grew up in New York City. I've always liked being surrounded by unfamiliar faces. It's comforting. I feel I'm in the midst of new possibilities. That's why I like to travel. When I was a kid I took a train trip to California to visit my grandmother. Back home, everyone thought I was weird. I didn't like sports, I wanted to be an actor. Jeffrey, I'm going to turn the water on. -OK! Things got so bad, one day my entire 5th-grade class chased me home after school. But for three days on the train, all by myself, alone among strangers, I had no history. No identity. I could be whatever I wanted to be. -You just-- is this what you want? -Just-- just right around here. -Just some new lines, right around the bottom edge. -Yeah. -OK! -Thanks. -Well what is the price of haircuts where you-- in your hometown? Various, I supposed. -What are the prices? -Yeah, Mm-hm. -I think you can still get a regular men's haircut for $12. -Uh huh. Uh huh. -But, you know, you go to a salon, or something it's-- -15 or more? -Oh, 25 at least. -Said you want to leave it long enough to comb, didn't he? -Well yeah, but there wasn't much there to begin with. -I can make it shorter. -No. You already got two strikes on you, I'm not gonna give you another chance at it. What grade are you in? -Seventh. What do you want to do when you get out of school? -I dunno. -I'm, uh, retired from the US Navy, and you were asking my boy what he hoped to be one day, but, uh, he hopes to be a fighter pilot one of his days. Wants to go to Academy. Is that what you want him to do? -Yeah, well, he's showing interest in that, and uh-- and uh... I wouldn't mind him being a fighter pilot. What do you think the biggest problem in this country is today? -Too many goddamn liberal news reporters. -Want to take the guns away from everybody, think that's gonna solve crime. Stupid ideas like that and the dumb politicians we got in Warshington, that go along with it. Got some very crooked, though, don't they? -Yeah, both. Dumb and crooked. They used to have statesmen to run this country, when they started. Wrote our Constitution. Now all we got's bureaucrats and politic-- politicians that don't amount to nothing. They couldn't get an honest job, so they run for government. They may be bought off. So tell me what you think, um, the solution is. -Oh, I doubt if it-- if anybody can really solve things, but they could start by doing away with a lot of the crap they show young kids on TV. They could make a good start by taking a lot of these bad guys, drug runners, and all people that's guilty of murder and rape and things out, and execute 'em. Quit babying them like they was sending them through Yale University. Be a lot of good starts if they just wanted to get with it. Turn-- turn America back to an honest, God-fearing place. See any hope of that happening? Not without a revolution. -This house here, Tom, has got your hardboard siding on it, it's what we call Masonite siding. And it's also got your shingled roof. What's really nice about this house here, is you got the Venetian blinds over here which is real nice. You've got the metal doorknobs instead of plastic. And then on all your doors you have these, door stoppers. Where your doors won't slam back into your panel. Usually when I get a customer come in, they'll come straight into this bay window because it's a attention-drawer. If you have a hutch, or a microwave stand, or something like that, you can set it right here. What I did with this home here is I cathedral'd it, all the way through. And that way you can put a ceiling fan in any room. Your pictures, and your little whatnots, and your flower arrangements, and your mail and all that, all that comes with the house when you buy it. Everything goes with the house. That's good. I'd sure like to have your business and everything. If you like, I'd be glad to take you in the office, set down, figure up your monthly payments and everything for you. But you'd need about 1800 down on this house. -1800 down? I'd say your payment would probably run you right around 215 a month. 215? -I appreciate ya coming in. Appreciate you. Any time. OK. Have a good evening. -You too. When you were a kid, what did you want to be when you grew up? -Professional baseball player. - Did you ever-- - did you try to be one? -I-- I was one. Really? Tell him, where'd you play? -I-- I went with Detroit Tigers Farm Club. Which this was back in '57. But I been selling mobile homes since '68. So, why'd you get out of baseball and into mobile homes? -Back then it just didn't pay that kinda money, I mean you either went big or you didn't go big at all. So I got married and...gave it up. What was your greatest moment in baseball? -When uh-- my sophomore year, when I pitched the high school team to the state championship. What do you do? For work? -I work at, uh, Lurcher Mall at the leather shop in the Record Mart. Yeah, it's pretty cool. I like it. Easy stuff. Do you work? -No. Want to have a family? -Yes! Very soon. You're pretty young to be parents. What do you think about that? -I think it's gonna be great, myself. I love children. I think it's gonna be really great. What about you? -I'm just nervous. I'm excited, but nervous in a way. I think I can do it. How old are you? -15. Growing up in New Jersey, I felt I was in a 1950s TV family. Mom, Dad, three kids, a beautiful house in the suburbs. I thought everyone lived the way we did, and I thought it would last forever. Then suddenly the family business went bankrupt, my parents got a divorce, we had to sell the house. Home was no longer what I had thought it was. That's when I realized "home" was something I'd have to figure out for myself. This is Division Headquarters we're coming up on here. Those guys in the orange right there? They're-- they're, uh, prisoners in the brig. They have them walking up and down through here, police-calling the Rabbit. Just picking up trash and cans and stuff. So, what did you do in the Gulf? -We didn't really see that much. Just mainly surrendering. I don't know how many prisoners we took, but it was a lot of them. I don't if you'd really call them prisoners, they-- "prisoner" kinda lends to the attitude that you had to take somebody and make 'em give up. You know, and these guys were just rushing out to give up. They're more like guests than they were like prisoners. So what was it like having a lover back here, being over there? -It was kinda difficult at times, cause, you know, everybody-- everybody misses their lover, be it male or female, when you're overseas, and, you know, everyone can sit around and talk about, you know, "Oh yeah, I miss so-and-so" and all that. And it's kinda difficult to-- you know, you can't really talk to anybody about it. You just gotta miss them and live with it. How'd you find about this bar? -The base advertises for it, because it's off-limits, and they hang up little flyers all over the place saying "Don't go here." And what-- what is it saying-- how does it describe the bar? -It doesn't describe the bar at all, it just lists it as being an off-limits establishment and gives an address of where it's at. You know, saying "Don't go there." How to find it? -Yeah, it tells you how to find it. But it doesn't say why it's off-limits or anything like that. It just says Friends Lounge, off-limits. But everybody on base knows that Friends Lounge is a local gay bar. -It's a part of theater. Like, I do it because it's a way to express myself. I don't want to be a woman. I love being a man. Uh, but I enjoy the theater, and I enjoy portraying it and acting and being something different than what-- what Danny can do. Danny can't get the attention of the people that Brandi can. Uh, Danny hasn't been able to stand up in front of the people and-- and raised almost $150.000 for AIDS, but Brandi can. And that's something I'm glad I can do. Or that she can do. Or he can do. Or it can do. -The boys used to come through the woods, crawl on their hands and knee sometimes when it was raining, with changes of clothes in plastic bags just to get inside here. And, it was really heart-wrenching because you think "These boys are dying for your country, and they're old enough to-- to die for your country, and old enough to get married and vote, but they're not old enough to walk into a bar, and be with-- with who they want to be, regardless of whether they're straight or gay. I don't understand it. Of course I never have. You seem like protective of your boys. -I am. If you had seen what they've gone through, you'd be protective too. -We're getting married! I'm in love with this dyke! And she loves this faggot! Yeah, we're getting married for A) money, B) support, um, psychologically and mentally, um, and C) just cause-- to get them people off our backs. You are the Marines. -Yes. Who's the most macho person at the table? -Her. You guys have to butch it up at the--? -Ohhhhh. -Butch is not the word. You're constantly thinking, you know, "hey, should I do that? Should I do that? Or will it look too feminine?" Do you have to femme it up? I asked them if they had to butch it up? -No. I can be tough. An-- an-- and it's acceptable. But yet on the other hand, if I don't go along with the males in-- in-- in a-- just a-- playing their little games, they-- they tend to say "Oh, well she don't like guys." You served in the Gulf? -Yes I did, I was there for the entire eight months. I left on my birthday, and didn't get back until, um, mid-April. 15th. -April 15th. Thank you, dear. I deserve my rights. I'm fighting for my country, and I don't want to be treated like a-- some little, you know-- a piece of road trash. -We asked, you know, Jeff why he was letting, for an interview, taping, you know, his face and having us cloaked and everything, and the more and more we thought about it, the more pissed we were at ourselves for asking to be...closed off like that. Because-- -Hidden when we're trying to fight not to be hidden. -We're trying to fight not to be hidden, here we are hiding. It's like, "I'm out of the closet! Wait a minute, I'm back in. No, wait! Hold on." I ain't gonna do it no more. I'm out. Fuck it. -Sorry, you can't come in here! Can we get a shot of Graceland? -You can't come in here. We're filming a documentary for-- -Huh? Television-- We need a shot of Graceland! -I don't have a clearance on you. You have to get a clearance next door. Where do we go? -Next office over. Next drive over. OK. -In 1935, Elvis Presley was born in Tupelo, Mississippi, in a two-room house, to Gladys and Vernon Presley. One day when he was a little boy, his mama worked so hard that he said, "Some day, Mama, I will buy you a house that has six bathrooms." And that's what Graceland has. Hmm. -What that must have felt like for Elvis to go from a two-room home to a mansion. If you'll look with me, in the concert hall, you will see that some of the audience here, like the lady on the left with the blonde hair, that is me. I'm standing. I'm gonna get a scarf. Kim, when did-- when did the Elvis thing start? -When I was a teenager. And there was a whole lot of girls on our block and, uh, after I saw him, you know, I was madly in love. And it just lasted all through the years. So, you know, it's like, um, uh, my husband is not jealous of Elvis at all, but, you know, when I say "I love Elvis" it's-- I do. But I'm in love with my husband. There's two different kinds of love. Anything in your life that you regret? Me? Yeah. Not really. Living one day at a time. Kim? -Yeah, I do. I regret, um... -Well through all the years he let me go to Memphis and he stayed home, with the kids, and, uh, and now he has MS, and he'll never be able to go. And that upsets me. -Well, it's a long trip down there and, um, you uh-- making a trip like that with this is kinda a rough deal, I tell you. -Look what he's missed. Even though he built Miniature Graceland, for me, you know, he can, um, uh, maybe kinda pretend? You know, a little bit or something. When I was a kid we moved around a lot, different apartments in Manhattan. I've never felt tied to any particular place. When I've gotten tired of living somewhere it's never occurred to me to stay there, I've always just moved on. I don't know what it would be like to have roots. To know deep down that here is where I belong. This is where I come from. This is where my life will unfold. This is where I'll die. I just want to give you a welcome, to Blue & White Restaurant here in Tunica, Mississippi. What happens here? -A lot of things-- -Everything. Everything wonderful. -Do both of us talk or just one? You can both talk. -OK. We do lots of things here, eat at Blue & White... -Go fishing. -Yeah. -Go to church! -Yeah. -That's about all it is here. -People stop in here to eat, come here to eat, because they like our catfish and our french-fried onion rings. - What-- - what's this town like? What's life in this town like for you? -Well, OK I guess. I been here all my life and I guess it's...have to be all right. Nothing special. How long did you work here? -18 years. Is it a good job? -Well, make an easy living, that's all I can say. Could be better, but, there's always soup! It could be better with... -More money. That's what could be better. Mind if I ask how much you make? -Well, 3.45 an hour. What with the work you have to do, it should be more. -But we're getting some, uh, boats in. What are they called-- gambling boats-- -Gambling boats on the Mississippi, that's just a little piece out-- -And that's to be a big, big diversion for everything else. We'll draw people from all over. What was the most exciting moment of your life? -Oh, my goodness! When I went to Europe last September. Of 1990. For 17 days. Had the most wonderful trip. What was it like there? -Oh it was great. We liked all the coun-- I believe I liked Holland and Germany and Switzerland better-- London was real good. We liked England, too. -I'm not in favor of the boat. -I am. -It might bring in something undesirable. -I doubt it. -I don't. -Bring in money! -That's what gambling does. -Bring in money. So, what's the most important thing in your life? -Working. Working and my family. That's the most important thing. OK, y'all out here now. -Real nice talking to you, though, sugar. -Y'all come back to see us. We really enjoyed having you. Bye! -Buh-bye! -Man, there ain't nothing here but farmland in this town. That's all they got here, farming. Long as they got their cotton-growing, their bean, their rice, and their wheat they OK. Long as-- long as, you know they keep people-- You know, peoples here, they-- they want good jobs, but you know most of them ain't got time to go to nowhere else to get a good job. And before everything you know, some of them stay on their creeping land, and then all for them to stay on that land they gotta work that land. And if they ain't gonna work that land they gotta get off that land. And then if they put them off that land, they got nowhere to stay. And then so they've got to work for them, for the little bit they pay them. Did you grow up here? -Yeah. What was it like growing up? -Hard, man. Real hard. Why? -People here, the way they dogging, round here, these people dogging, man. What does that mean? -What's that mean? Yeah. -Dogging? Well, like, the way you-- if I'm-- OK, like if there's a background, if you've been in a lot of trouble, if you can't get no good job and your peoples they don't-- they don't-- they don't teach you how to get a good job, you can't get no good job here. They ain't paying you nothing here to work here. I'm not finna be driving no tractor. I ain't driving no tractor. They ain't paying nothing to drive no tractor. I ain't no slave. Those slavery days've been over with. Who's inspired you? -My mom? They're the ones I look for. My mom. I don't look for nobody else. Whatever the world brings tomorrow, I don't know. I just live for today, today only. That's it. E is for everything that you have done for your children while they was growing up, even though the time has become hard, the mother will always be there for you. So you look around, you see your mother, tell your mother thanks for everything. So I give you an E. R, R is held by Shaquana White. R is for the remarkable things that a mother has done for her child during their years of growing up. If you understand remarkable, you understand what a remarkable mother is. A mother would be there for you no matter what the situation is. So ladies and gentlemen, I give you an R. So all together, M-O-T-H-E-R is for "mother." So if you's a mother, stand up and give yourself a hand. -My mom is very independent. She is loving, caring, kind, and very tender. And I love her very much. -You know, we're just like friends. Which we are friends. You know. She's a mother. She's a friend. She's everything. -I love her a lot, and I believe that I can tell her anything that I want her to know. And I-- she teaches me what's wrong, what's not wrong, and what's right to do? And I love her for that. I think she's mean, sometimes. Well she'll be in the right, when she'll be mean. -She'll be right, cause she tells us what's right cause she love us. -Spank you, too. -My mother was the mother of this church. She passed about five years ago. But that still don't stop me from coming to church. When they had the program, it remind me so much about my mother. I thought about her dearly. I still think of her dearly. As far as I'm concerned she's not dead, she's alive in me. Yeah, she passed about five years ago. I miss her. I met my husband, he was in the automobile business. And he was a great dancer, loved Latin dancing, and we'd go out dancing every night. And then Walter Winchell had written there'll be someone dancing at El Morocco in New York, and it just took off from there. -And they're coaches and Saints football players and the Mod Squad. -That's the Mod Squad-- -The original Mod Squad? -Uh-huh, Cesar Romero, a very good friend, I just loved that man. Do you have any regrets? -Uh, yeah. I had the biggest and the bestest that came into see the show, we had John Wayne, Robert Mitchum, Deborah Kerr, and, um-- God another one, I'm trying to think. It's one of the big ones. The silent one that played uh-- uh-- very quiet, that played a lot of Western roles. Um-- gosh I can't think of his name offhand. He died back in the 60s. But, you know some of the biggest stars have been in to see me, and I did get pictures with them. -I'm Ann Milling, I volunteer at Project Lazarus here in New Orleans, Louisiana, and we are delighted that you are visiting our residential facility for, um, AIDS patients, and we welcome you to our community. Are you confused about Oprah? I'm not surprised-- -They think they were good for your health. While it says "No Cholesterol," it doesn't say that this cooking oil is-- All right, Henry-- -I was tired! Anybody tired?-- -Smokey Bear? Smokey the Bear! -That's a lot. -Due process, my foot! It's one poor lone man against the company, what can he do? -Well, what do you think? Isn't that a traditional look to you? -More than 60 comedies raised almost 5.9... -I have AIDS. I, um, live here at the Lazarus House, I volunteer two days a week at the food bank, I, um, have good days and bad days. I'm in a lot of pain, from neuropathy. It's the virus is attacking the nervous system. So I have to, uh, take a lot of stuff for pain. You ever been afraid? -I'm afraid now. Yeah. I'd be lying if I said that I wasn't scared. But I guess it's the unknown. So I, um-- yeah I'm scared. How do you get through it? -I cry. I try to help other people. I try to see what they're going through and how they feel, just before death. I wonder what, you know, if anything has really happened after, um, they're gone. I wonder about, um...soul, spirit, or an afterlife of any kind, or if it hurts, right at that point, really bad. Some people I've seen really fight it, and other people seem to just, go very peacefully. -I stand in the window and I be looking at, uh, the church down the street. It's a old parish, quality church. And the cars and the trains and at the trees and the buildings around it. And the fresh air is so good to breathe. And we're right by the river, so everything is-- the window's just beautiful in the morning time and the air is-- but ain't got nothing to do, this is where you come and think about a lot of things. So James, when you were younger, did you think about what you wanted to do? What you wanted to be? -Yeah. And it just didn't work. What'd you think about? -Oh I used to want to be all kind of things. Wanted to be a doctor. I wanted to be an embalmer. Never a police. Uh, a truck driver, cause they travel all over the states. Then my mother passed and I moved to California. To Los Angeles. Stayed there a while, then I returned back home. I didn't like California. What's been important to you, in your life? -Keep on living. Some days you get depressed with it, but you have to hang it on up. Cause, um, if you get depressed, it will help to break you down. So, I just keep finding something to do. Every day I find something different to do. I go play ball. Ride my bike, play with my dog. Play with everybody here. Fool with the employees and watch the bus come! Ooh there's one coming down the street now. Every- and I'll be in this window every day. It's my favorite spot. The window. That's it. I'll be watching the bus. Attention! -Downward right! -Step! What are your hopes for the future? -To put my kid through school and college. -I want to be a lawyer. -I want to be a medical engineer. -A nurse. What about you? -I want to be aaaa-- I want to be a-- a...nurse. -Hope for the future. I guess world peace, and prosperity. -To become very successful, hopefully wealthy! -Clean environment for my kid to grow up in, um, no more war. -Well one big hope is that, people will receive the Lord Jesus Christ as their savior in their life. -Uh, marry a be-- a good wife. -Man, I ain't got the slightest idea. What do you hope for the future? -Get my children back. Get them back? -Yeah, uh-huhn. Where are they? -The state took them away. What happened? -Cause I was homeless. -My hope for the future? My future's already here, buddy. It's already here. I used to hate traveling on my own. Then I reached the point where I realized I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. So I left college, and took the bus to San Francisco. I was 19. I had no idea what lay ahead for me. It was the first time I understood how vast America is. I've lived in California ever since. I wonder why some people have to move thousands of miles from where they grew up before they feel like they're home. -Look how beautiful that is. Isn't that beauti-- you've got to see the beauty of Las Vegas. Now it's beautiful. It really is. No place in the world can you get a prime-rib steak for $3! Get a shrimp cocktail for 50 cents up here! -What's going on? -Come on, man. I've got some goodies! And we've got sandwiches, hot coffee and kool-aid, and razors! It's all free. -Thank you very much, buddy. -Have a good day now. Thank you. -You too. -I hope you get a job. Le-- le-- just let me say, Lord, please, bless them with a job. Do this, we ask in his precious name. Amen. Amen. What'd you used to do? -I'm a blackjack 21 dealer, a roulette dealer, I do a little bit of everything, you know. But, uh, I've been out here since '76, you know, so... What happened? -What happened? That brought me out here? Yeah. -Internal Revenue. -This corner's been here since 1966. What is it? What is this corner? -It's just a corner that people would come by and pick up people that want to work-- -Contractors to come by and pick you up to work. -Pick you up to work. -They want you to work. But see, they have a sign up there that says "No standing, no walking, no nothing, huh." OK. Hey, how can they take and violate my civil rights, huh? OK. This is a right to stay-- this state here have a-- a-- a right to a-- work state law. -I'm not downtown trying to steal nothing. Why are they coming up to mess with me-- -Might as well put a gun in my hand and tell you, "Hey, go in there and get naked!" I'll tell you to get naked, man. And I am most serious about that, too. Cause I gotta have me some money just like you've gotta have some money to live on, right? -That's what I'm saying. -If I go in the elevator and tell you to get naked? You gonna get naked, my friend. And that's uh-- that's a true thing. -Cause it's hard out here. -That's a beautiful painting that you see a man, that he's got the shakes and he's-- he needs a haircut and he hasn't been out of his clothes in four to five weeks, and you get him cleaned up, and get him scrubbed up in that divine detergent and motivate him! He looks good! Build his self-confidence up! Buddy that's a painting that Rembrandt couldn't paint. -How'd I get in this mess? OK, um, let's see. Husband walked out last year, last summer. I came to Las Vegas to go to work. I had a beautiful liquor store. And one guy decided to attack me one night, and I quit work because they wouldn't give me a daytime job. So I screwed myself. Went to Reno. Really. Went three months without work. Came back here, and have gone another, almost nine weeks without work. So all together it's been about six months living like this. -I came out here on a bus trip with some money, hoped to win money here, gamble, Las Vegas, you know. And, you know, you come out here with hopes, and it's not what it really seems to be. You know, there's a lot of-- lot of hurting people out here, you know. What kind of work do you do? -Construction work. Fix cars. Whatever. Whatever gets that dollar in your hand. How do you see your future? -Eh. It'll come up and it'll go down. So will yours, so will his. -Give me your job and take my job. Go with me one week. Leave your billfold and your numbers at home and try with me one week and see how long you would last. How you going to get out of this situation? By myself my own way. Some day my luck's going to change. Change. Change. Change. Change. Change. Change. Change. We have a winner! -Yeah. Yeah. How did this become yours? -What?! This didn't become mine, this was created, by me. From dirt! From nothing! From air! That's how it became mine. One little bit at a time. Let's put it this way, it took me 20 years to become an overnight success. Eh? This is our own invention, it's a, uh, carousel of flippers. Uh, I don't know how to explain that. This is what we call our victory machines. Victory carousel, we put this in celebration of the victory over there in the Middle East. But, as you'll see, when the jackpot goes off the flags wave, the lights light. You have to look at the flags waving while they're waving. See? It's an achievement. It's a marvel. Do you think some people are lucky and some people are unlucky? -Some days I have a lot of luck. But it was all bad. See sometimes people are very lucky, they lose all their money and they're very lucky. It was just unlucky, that's all. They just didn't realize it. This is another restaurant when people want peace and quiet. They want some place quiet. And the lights are-- why are the lights so bright, Peter? Isn't that better? We need atmosphere. One of my better pictures, right over there. Who are your role models? -We should name Les Polizzi, secondly Nelson Mandela, you know super guy, and thirdly Mother Teresa. So are there principles to gambling? -I don't quite understand the question. Are there any basics that one needs to know to be-- -All you need-- all you need to know when you're a gambler is one simple rule. And it's the same advice for everybody: You bet more when you're winning and less when you're losing. It's as simple as that. When you're winning you bet more. When you're losing you bet less. Everybody follows that rule they'll do a lot better than they're doing. Did ya get the flags waving?! How much do think where we are in our lives is within our control and-- -I told you about luck. Which luck are you talking about, the good luck or the bad luck? Are you just talking about luck in general? How much are we responsible and how much is due to luck in general? -88% we're responsible for it. 12%, goes with the territory. You know, somebody from above makes up that bit. But we make up most of it. Aha. 1600 car-space parking garage. The largest in town. How do you like your uniform? -I like it. It's nice. I like the theme idea. I like the whole idea of dressing up like that in a costume. It's not really a uniform. Every place else, you gotta wear black and white, it's-- it's a stuffier atmosphere. Where here, it's lighter cause we dress up, we're part of a theme-type thing, you know, it's a little bit of culture. I like culture! You know, I like that-- that whole idea, you know, like that... So I feel like I'm going to a Shakespearian festival every morning. Hear ye, hear ye, you know. -Where y'all from? Where you from? San Francisco. -San Francisco? Where you from? -New Orleans. Where you going? -Going to LA. What for? -What for? I'm an NA counselor. Uh huh? -Uh huh. Gotta help the world stay clean, man. I was a drug user for 11 years. Not-- not, 11 off and on years, 11 years, you know? And, um, it's not something, like I say, I can just walk away from. If I could, I really, really would have been healthy. You know. It's not easy, I cried many nights, you know. And, um, every day I count the days, you know. I can't express to you enough, I can't express to my family enough, I can't express to my co-friends, co-workers. It's a-- it's a-- it's a wonderful thing to wake up in the morning and know that I still have the $20 that I went to sleep with last night. You know? Where you going? -LA. What for? Become a superstar. Why else? - What do-- - what do you you? -Um, act. Music. Anything. Where you from? -Texas. My dream is to be in a band. Be a bass player. You now, or be in the movies, man. Yeah. So how are you going to do that? What are you going to do when you get there? -I got an uncle that lives there, and...um...he-- he knows people. And, if it happens for me it happens for me, if it don't, no big deal. And I'm happy. I'm clean. I'm-- I'm off drugs. I don't do drugs anymore. Um...I had a problem with drugs. But I'm clean, for now. Today. How did you, uh, how did you get out of it? -Oh, I've got a baby. A daughter and a girl that I'm in love with, back in Texas. So, that-- that's helped me out a lot. I know I can't ever have them back. Keep, you know, keep going the route I was going, so I gotta do something different, man. Can you take your glasses off? -Yeah. What happened with, uh, with your girl and the baby? -Uh, we-- we went through a lot of problems because of drugs and alcohol, constant fighting. Couldn't get along. Just...she said I was a monster. Were you? Yeah. I was. Like how? -Drugs, and alcohol. Makes me violent. But, as long as I'm not fucked up, I'm OK. I'm a good person. -We're moving. We're moving to Eugene, Oregon. How come? -Because we don't like it in Mississippi anymore. Why? -There's no hope there. There's no hope. It's just... -The South, it's pfft, drink beer and go to the beach and-- -Yeah. - fry your brain-- - You know, the heat? -Yeah. -The attitude, the prejudice, the, um, the ignorance. -Yeah. -The apathy in Mississippi, and the South, too, you know. The-- the down home, go to-- go to high school, quit, get a job in a restaurant, and live in a trailer. You know? And I just can't see myself doing that, and it's really easy to get caught up in it. It's real easy, and I'm not saying Oregon is the place, but I-- I've gotta try elsewhere and do something. You know, I've got a few years left to do it, to have the freedom. So... tha-- How old are you? -19. How old are you? -19. 19. What do you do for fun? -I don't think you wanna know. Um, we-- we-- we do, um, mushrooms. We, uh, I mean we smoke marijuana. -We go...out to the golf course at night, you know, and walk around-- -Walk around at night-- -We don't do the club scene. We don't, you know, drink. We don't do any of that. You know, we go out and we live, you know, like in the city. But we go out and find nature, you know. We just go outside, in the woods. We were born 20 years too late. Right on. -I don't know, that's the best way I can describe it. We totally missed out-- Yeah, we missed out. What are-- do you have no love for your generation? -Oh. No that-- Generation of swines. -Generation of swine. That's what they are. Yes. In a neon world. -Yeah. Plastic. Plastic. -Hi girls! Wooooooooh! If I do say so. -At 10:30 the whole parade is going to come to a stop. -Just south of us, uh-- -OK. -I don't see them making-- -Well hello, young man! -Everybody, do a split. You're selling agents. Oh my god! -All right! Big smiles!! -I think they're fantastic, aren't they? -Aren't they darling? -Yes. -Just love them. They're daaaarling. -Look at those-- did you see the one on the end? -Yeah. Yeah, she's a doll, isn't she? -How do they all get such beautiful hair?! Look at their hair! I know! It's just gorgeous! It is gorgeous. The curls! Does that look like the Apaches to you? Or the...? It looks like the, uh, the Cobras. Cobras? And the-- and the Hueys. Uh, I just can't help to thinking, uhn, I'm glad to see this as, uh, as a civilian and not as a member of the military of the opposite force. So, sitting on the ground, seeing these, uh, United States military aircraft coming toward you. And they really look do look, lots of-- Very impressive. And now we can hear them moving on, coming overhead, now these are the helicopters. -Great day for America. It's time that we feel good about America, we're excited about America, we honor our troops, and indeed honor the whole country. Uncle Sam is proud of us all. -USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! Woo! After 18 days, we return to San Francisco. It's where we've made our home. But I guess it depends on where you think home is, really. Out there somewhere, or inside yourself. What are your hopes for the future? -That I have one. To at least stay healthy, and that taxes don't go up too much higher. And that we stay out of wars. And that the Lord will come. Before I go. That would be nice. That would be neat. -Well, living a very happy life. That's all I'm looking for, in the future, is a happy life. I guess everybody would look-- would look for that, cause I do. -Well, I hope to have a very nice family and a very healthy baby. And just to be good to myself, that's about it. Yeah. Are you happy? -Am I happy? I'm-- I'm happy, yet-- yet I'm sad. When I'm happy because I'm clean, and I'm trying, you know, and I'm fighting it, but I'm sad because of the time that I has wasted, the money that I has wasted. You know. -How do I know I'm gonna wake up in the morning? I can-- I can look at those people, that's not in the condition that I am, mi-- might not have legs and wheelchairs and stuff like that, you know. I'm fortunate. Very, very fortunate. -I'm fine where I'm at, you know, I like it. It's really nice. You know, what I do and all. So I'd say I'd probably be out risking my life. Any regrets in your life? -No, none. Lotta-- lotta bad times, well not a lotta bad times, but a number of times that you just think, "Man, this is too much." But I don't regret them at all, cause they sure made me be a better person further down the line. -I've had both of my lungs taken out, I got a pacemaker that in that don't work right, to keep me going. Lotta problems, and still go fishing and hunting rabbits and things. -Something I regret? There's nope-- there's nothing to regret in my life. I mean, regretting ain't gonna help you now. So, that's it. It's a quiet evening, and the sun's going down, so the kids will be riding their bike backward and forward. That's it. -Um...marrying Corina? I want to have my baby. And I want to make money. A lot of money. Yeah, I figure LA is the place to do it. It's the place to be. That's where dreams come true, and I'm a dreamer. I've always been a dreamer. I'll always be a dreamer. Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
