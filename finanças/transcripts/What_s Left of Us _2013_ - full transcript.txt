Hello. I'm Axel. I live with Ana and Jonathan. We are locked in here. I don't know for how long. Medea. Hello. I'm Jonathan. And this is stupid. This is stupid. I don't know howl get into these things. I don't know what to say, this is stupid. Do I have to talk? Are you okay? I'm fine. Axel, did you get hit? You have some kind of bruise here. THE DESERT My name is Ana. I'm recording myself. This is a bit weird. I'm going to tell you that. Outside the situation is quite difficult. It's hard to get out. And it seems we are trapped, I don't know for how long. Starting from today. This will be the consulting room. And each of us can come and record ourselves and say whatever we want. We are going to save the tapes in this trunk. Which Jonathan locked yesterday. So that nobody will be able to see. I don't have any reason to feel guilty. The idea was to give him one tattoo. And now he has his whole arm covered. He is tattooing his whole arm. A-1. You're cheating. Hit. I'm not cheating. Yes, you are. I'm not playing any tricks. You're just an idiot who puts the boats in the same place. You're a lousy player. I beat you at everything. You want to bet? You want to bet on it? If I win, you finish my neck. And my back. Okay. If I win, you do this same thing. But with one of them. HOW? First I'll beat you, then we'll see how. Will you do it? Holy shit. Are you in bed already? Close it quickly so the flies don't get in. There has to be a leak there. Here? Yes. Did you get the cloth? I got it. I'm going to adjust this. What year could this picture be from? 1940? 1930 at the latest? It's crazy how two people can be together forever. In love until the day they die. Maybe they had never even been with anyone before. It's like their only love. Give that a full turn, so you can seal it properly. I love this one. What's the name of their grandson? I don't know. I don't think any tape mentions his name. See if it's coming in. Yeah, it's coming in. I don't feel anything. There's no wind outside! Hey. Come on. Shall we go? You lost. Coming. Loser. Iwon! Bye bye, loser. Bye, winner. Don't act like you don't know. NOW? Yeah. Just one game. Alright. Just one! Here. Axel. I want to ask you a question. When we finish, when there's no spot left, what's going to happen? I'm going to leave. Is everything okay? Everything is fine. Stop it, seriously. No kissing. Unless you two kiss each other. Then, I'll kiss you both as a reward. Yes! One moment! A nice kiss, okay? Yes, very good! You each won a kiss from the girl. Who is first? Axel? One second. Third kiss of this house, second boy. Axel, come here! Don't go. The three of us have to be here. I want to say one thing. The last thing I'm going to say. This isn't what it looks like. This is a family. A very close family. He said to me: sleep peacefully. I'll be watching you. So nothing will happen to you. I breathed and felt calm. At some point I fell asleep. I don't know. It's strange. Axel! Yes. I'll be right out. It's okay, I can wait. Coming. Come in. I woke up today with a fly buzzing in my brain. The first thing I see is that jerk-off Axel, looking at me. And when I realize, I was uncovered, naked and with the mosquito net strategically opened, arranged, tied back. Very cautiously. Strange. What are you looking at? Why are you looking at me? What do you see? Do you see this? And do you see this? Can you see it? I hate them. Jonathan hates them too. Jonathan was never very passionate. He's an engineer and he fucks like an engineer. Johnny, there's something out there. What's going on? Stay here. We'll go. Come on, open it! Come on. There can't be many, there's not much noise. Fuck! What happened? This piece of shit jammed. Fucking god dammit! Let me do it, move over. Son of a bitch. Done. I need two more Greek names. Hades. One more. Dionysus. Dionysus. With an's', not a 'c'. That's it, come on. Let's go to sleep. Pass it here. Truth. Do you remember the first one you told me to do? No, you have thousands. Take a guess. On one of your arms. Which one? This one or this one? That one. Where? That one. Dare. I want... I want you to repeat the last recording you made. No! It's mine. I'm not going to do that. You have to. What are you looking at? Why are you looking at me? Do you see this? And you see this? Do you? And this one? You see it? I hate them. I think Jonathan does too. Done. No, It doesn't end there. Yes, it ends there. No, it was very short. You are always closed up in there so long, so it can't be that short. Yes, it ends there. Dare. Jonathan. You have to tell Axel that he can't look at me anymore. Axel, you can't look at her anymore. Dare. You have to stare Ana in the eyes. No, I'm just kidding! You have to stare into the eyes of one of them. That again? You're not going to do that, Jonathan. I'm not changing it. No, you won't do it. - I'm not changing it. - Now? No, not now. When? Let's play now, later we'll see. I hit the gas and you can't imagine how it went. It was awesome, roared like a lion. I come back on the same highway, I take the exit and some idiot crashed into me head on. This first thing I think is: "I'll kill him!" I tried to open the door but it was stuck. So I began to unload. I began to unload right there, trying to force the door open. The car was completely totaled. Do you want me to help you? Okay. Take this. I'm going to the back. But you never go. Right now I have the urge to go. Right now? Right now. I'll leave you two alone. What? Nothing. Millie, today we made the house constitution. It's like the regulations. For example, no one can go out alone. At least one person has to stay in the house. We can only go outside in pairs. That's a crucial rule. Important decisions must be voted on unanimously. If one of us doesn't agree, we can't make the decision. If one person wants to play a game, then we all have to play. We'll see if that one works. It's a bit strict, but those are the rules. I'm recording this video over the birthday of Alberta's little grandson. I loved that video. I watched it tons of times. I'm starting to give up videos that I loved to watch because I need to tell this stuff to someone. But if... This is private! No, Johnny, no. Johnny, not here. Come on, Axel wont know. We said not inside the house. Come here. I have to turn off the camera! You're tickling me! You're tickling me! Why did you record it? Why did you record it? I won't share you. I won't share you. Here. I have to relax a bit. I have to leave this place. Ana? She's taking a shower. That's where I like to look at her the most. Why? Because you can really see her ass. You idiot! What do you like better: tits or ass? Tits. What are you laughing at? I like asses. Don't forget to change the battery in the microphone at the gate! Okay! The protocol is to stay in the house and not go out. I can't leave. I mustn't leave. I mustn't. I have to wait. No matter what I hear I have to wait. Wait. Throw it over there! More to the left! Wait, wait! More to the left! Come on, to the left! Ana! Pull! I'm pulling, wait! Stop it, it's coming to me! Wait, stop it. That's it. Igor n! Stop, it's coming to me! Stay calm! Come on, calm down. Stop! Stay calm! Come on, get it inside. Wait! Yes, yes! Pull! Wait! Pull a little that way, it's coming to me! Wait, stop! You pull, come on! I'm stopping it. Igor n! Wait, wait! Stand up, man, stand up. Come on, I got it. Keep it over there! Pull a bit more. Pull, come on! More! The son of a bitch stinks. It's not staying here. It's staying. No. It can't stay. It's staying. Let go of it. It's staying. Axel and I decided, and we're the majority. What the fuck does that matter? Those aren't the rules. Don't bust my balls over the rules. Decisions have to be unanimous. Don't they, Axel? It was a dare. Axel? You're right. But it was a dare. I can't even be here. Ana. No practicing. I want to see it. Ana! I'm on the Greeks now. But I can't think of many. Medea, Helen, Plato, Aristotle. And... I don't know, I'm stuck. It really bugs me. Someone had a book of names. It had a list of all the names that exist. It would be great to have that. They're almost empty. We have two weeks of water left. What would my funeral be like? That's when you find out how much people loved you. Who loved you. Who cries, who doesn't come. If you were important to them. What would your funeral be like? There's nobody. What do you mean nobody? Nobody. What about me? Neither are you, you are with Axel. Of course I'm with Axel. I would be here with Axel. With Axel. The two of you together. Alone. I wouldn't do that to you. You wouldn't be doing anything to me. Be practical. Think about it. You're alone in the world. Axel is alone in the world. Axel loves you, he can take care of you. It's okay, you two being together. Am I right? It's fine. Hey, what's your name? You look like a... Facundo. No, Gonzalo. Javier. Any of those sound right? A Greek name. Pythagoras! Pythagoras. What are you looking at? Pythagoras, look at me. What are you looking at? You feel that? Doesn't this hurt? For fuck's sake! Why do you do that? Axel? Are you asleep? No. When are you going to do it? Decide quickly so it disappears. Tomorrow. I don't know. Remember that it's a dare. You have to do it. Don't try to go in the supermarket. There's no water. It's full of metal plates, you can cut yourself. Are you listening? Yes. Don't forget about the pharmacy. Axel! Hello! Hello! Is there anybody there? Please! I'm alone! My name is Teresa. I've been walking for weeks. Please! Please! Let me come in. Please, I'm alone! Hey! Please! Let me in! Let me in! Please, I'm coming closer. Hello! What are you doing? You son of a bitch! Please, I'm alone! Hey! Son of a bitch! Yesterday I went outwith Axel. Just Axel and me. It's been a long time since Axel and I went out. It was very awkward. He didn't speak and I didn't speak. I didn't look at him. But he looked at me. It used to be different. It's so hot. That's right, you can't feel the heat. That's great. To not feel. Come on, man, get up. If not you won't sleep at night. Come on. Come on. I have a headache. How bad? Bad. Ana! What? What? Your water ration is used up and I'm not giving you any of mine. Then make it rain. Sure. I'll make it rain but I want something in exchange. What? That you and Axel talk to each other. Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday, dear Ana! Happy birthday to you! Harder! When did you make this? It's delicious! I hope they're what you need. Thank you. They're beautiful. Axel has a gift for you. Really? - Yes. Book of Names. Axel: male name of Hebrew origin. Swedish variation on the name Absalom. Father and Lord of peace. Ana: of Hebrew origin. Hebrew for 'compassion' or "God had compassion for me. " Jorge. Jose, Juan. It's not here. How can it not be? No, but it has to be here. What do you mean it isn't? Jonathan has to be there. How can it not be? Jonathan is not here. Is Pythagoras here? Pythagoras. Good! Symbolically... Who's Pythagoras? Symbolically, Pythagoras is the public and social man par excellence. You gave it a name? Shall we toast? To the taxi? I was into the Greek names and Pythagoras seemed pretty. Why? Axel. Do you want to know its name? You want to know its real name? Axel. Axel. Stay here. It's her birthday, Axel. What's its name? Alejandro Parache. It's not Pythagoras, nor Alejandro. It isn't shit! Today we're gonna do it. Let's go that way. We went that way last time. Let's go the other way. It's the only way to get there. No, that way! Come on! Come on over here! What's the matter? You're slow. Religious shop. Regional articles. Gift shop. What are you doing with this? Two, four, ten. You've got a lot of money, Alejandro. So your name isn't Pythagoras, Alejandro? What does Alejandro mean? Alejandro: protector. Protector? That's not you. Book of Names. Stop looking over there. I said stop looking! Why did you do what you did? I can understand a lot of things. I can understand that you can't stand me. I can take that. And I understand you think I'm an idiot. And that you think I'm childish. I can live with that. And with us not talking to each other. I've gotten used to it. But why did you have to look at my life? What did you want to see? Is this what you wanted to see? The two of us could have been good together. But it was you who distanced yourself. Did you touch yourself? Touch yourself now. Do it, jerk off. But make it nice and long. Because when you leave this room, I will be there, watching you. And I'll know whether you did it or not. Relax a little. We can't sleep here, it's impossible. I'm not going back to the bedroom. Stay with your friend, I don't mind. So let's go sleep in the back then. No, I'm not sleeping there. Can't you smell how much that thing stinks? No more stink now. Alright. Tell me what happened. If you won't tell me, then I can't help you. I can't sleep next to him anymore, Johnny. I just can't. You decide, stay here or go over there. Whatever you want. But no, not me. What did you do to her? I didn't do anything to her. I feel uncomfortable. It's looking at us. It's not looking at us. It doesn't look this way. It's looking at us all the time. No, Johnny. What's the matter? I'm observing you obsessively. Does it bother you? No. Not here, Johnny. Come on. Axel won't know. We said not inside the house. I'm here, in the consulting room. What a stupid idea. Recording ourselves was Ana's idea. I like how she draws. I like how... I like her scent. I like the way she kisses. When all this is over, I'd like to have a child with Ana. Because I also have to tell this stuff to someone. This is private! No, Johnny. No, Johnny. Not here. Come on. Axel won't know. We said not inside the house. Why did you record it? I won't share you. What is this? A new game? What? Sit down, please. Leave the plate. Do you want to tell me the rules so I can participate too? What the fuck is going on? What are you doing? Nothing. Neither of you is going to talk? You both are going to keep your mouth shut? What is it that I have to understand? Is there a problem with me? Is it me? Tell me if it's me! L... I'm really intrigued to know what did you think of me when we first met? When you and Jonathan found me, I was crying desperately, thinking I was going to die. And you brought me to the house. If we had met in another place, in another time, in another story, I think we could have been together. Many nights when we went to sleep I watched you. And imagined what would a date with you have been like? You would come pick me up and we'd go out for some ice cream, or that you'd look at me more, and then smile. I think it would have been beautiful. ...that you'd look at me more, and then smile. I think it would have been beautiful. I also imagined what it would have been like to have known you before. New York attacks California. I move my armies down. I've got two. Six. When you played together, you would beat me. You made treaties. You're destroying each other and making it easy for me. Are you done? Yes. Peru attacks Chile. You're defending with three. No, enough with attacking me. Three, five, two. Good. You won. I have these in Colombia that I move and attack Chile again. No. You can't regroup and then attack. Why? Because you can't. Why? You just can't. Stop. Who says so? Those are the rules. What rules, Axel? Guys! The part about regrouping isn't here. It doesn't exist anymore. When a player finishes his attacks, he can start regrouping his armies. But once he starts regrouping, he can no longer make new attacks on any part of the map, during that turn. We can add a new sheet to this and we can write the rules that we want. No, it's just you can't. If you change the rules it's a different game. And what's wrong with playing a different game? What do you mean? It's a different game. We are playing this game. There's nothing wrong with playing a different game. Shall we? There's nothing wrong. We can make up the rules we want for everything. We can write them down ourselves. It's a different game and it's fine. No. The new rules say that whoever gives up, wins. Look at that. So you won. That's great. I won. You won. Very good, Axel. I went to a Catholic school. I didn't have friends. I was very shy. What embarrassed me the most was that everyone would think that I was alone. And it was most obvious during recess. I went to the cafeteria and made sure I was served last to kill time. I would buy something and eat it while I walked. Because if I sat down it would be obvious that I was sitting alone. So, I walked, I went to the bathroom and shut the door. Maybe I didn't even pee. And if there was time left, I'd return to the classroom, pretend I grabbed something. Or that I had remembered to write down something. And I'd write down anything. I lied. The shame wasn't about being alone. It was about the others feeling sorry for me. I miss you sleeping by my side. At first I thought that, I didn't like it. I thought you were laughing at me. That you talked about me all the time, that you looked at me. But then I got used to it. Sometimes I woke up and I didn't know where I was. I'd turn over, and see you. I would slowly get out of the bed. I'd get close to you, lay down by your side. I wouldn't leave until I saw you breathing. I can't. I don't want you to leave. Come on. I can't keep tattooing you. Do it yourself. I can't do this part alone. Ask Ana to help you. Axel! Axel, come here. Sit down. Ana! Come here. Sit down. Sit down, come on. Both of you. We aren't doing well. This isn't working anymore. Axel, you are now covered. And you, Ana, without knowing it, you're helping Axel leave this place. The situation is unsustainable. I can't even breathe in this house anymore. There was a time when the three of us were good. That isn't strange for us. Maybe we have to do something different to be good together again. Look at each other. Look at each other. Look at her, Axel.
