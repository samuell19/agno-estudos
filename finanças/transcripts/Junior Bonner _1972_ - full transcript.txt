- Turn your toes in. - All right. Nod your head. It looks like Old Sunshine is still champ. So far, no one has ridden him for the eight second count. Getting a Brahma bull to leave isn't easy. Get off the wall. The first bull rider is Pascaderer's only cowboy... and the former champion in this event... J.R. Bonner. And he drew for himself the current champion Brahma bull... Buck Roan's Old Sunshine. And he ain't never been rode. Hang around, old J.R. His name's Red Terwiliger, although a lot of cowboys... are calling him money bags these days. Red Terwiliger and his Brahma bull called Tornado. Best score on that ride... 75 points on a maximum score of 100. That puts Red out in front. Rodeo Cowboy Association and officials... thank you very much for coming out. We hope you've enjoyed it. Please drive safely, walk carefully. Maybe I ought to take up another line of work. See you in Prescott, J.R. Fill it up, sir? Let me have four gallon. Make it regular. Hello. Howdy. - Howdy, mister. - Hi. Well, she's about two quarts low. You want to let me have that forty weight? Forty weight? You bet. - I'll take some of them apples. - We have some nice, fresh ones. All right. That'll be thirty cents. Thank you. You bet. It's 8:45 in the Mile High City. Robert B. Goode here. You're in tune to KMOT radio. The temperature stands at 78 degrees outside of the studios. Locally, up to 40,000 visitors... - Hi, J.R. - Hey, how's the bull rider? Lonesome. Hey, give him a beer. Not for long. Wait till you try our brand of sunshine. Come on, boys. Come and get it. A little more, Pete, a little more. Ace! Oh, Ace! Sorry I missed you, Ace. Have you seen Ace Bonner? Who? Ace Bonner! Never heard of him! It only costs $5,000, Curly. I don't need a penny more, and I wouldn't take it... if you dropped it playing solitaire. I can hit it, boy. Ace, you never missed... Not when it came to costing me money. All right, so I never found much of that Nevada silver. But, Curly, this time, I'm talking about Australia... Gold. Dad, Australia's a long reach. It's too long for me. But, boy, I've already invested my last 3,000 in this project. I don't want any part of it... Not a penny of it. I'm fed up to here with your schemes. If you want to stick around here, that's fine with me. I'll put you on a weekly allowance, but that'll be that. Send his bill to me, Rose. Well, anyway, honey, I'm in your hands. The nurse's best equipment... Her hands and her heart. My hand on your heart, Rose. But first a word from our sponsor. Hi, folks, I'm Curly Bonner. Have I got some news for you. Neighbors, if you're thinking about a second home... or retirement in the clean air country... then look no further than my new mobile home development... located just east of Prescott, Arizona... The Mile High mountain area... with friendly people waiting to meet and greet you. Now, come out and visit me at the Bonner Trading Post. - Howdy, men. - Howdy, Buck. Hi, Buck. Hey, you boys mind getting down off the fence there? Thank you. Hey, Claude, put this old black hookin' son of a bitch... in by himself somewhere. - I'll get him. - I'll get him. Hey, watch him there. He'll stick his tongue in you. Get in there. Come on, cattle! Now, now! Get in there! Get in there! What's that black little orange number? Just a second. Eleven. Check. Thanks. This is a rough way to miss a paycheck, J.R. You'd have to be an idiot to ride one of them bulls. Hey, Junior, you got to watch that old bull. He's meaner than a snake. Most fellas would like to trade him off for a hound pup... and then pay $10 to get the hound pup shot. Well, good morning, J.R. J.R., how are you? - How's everything, Bill? - Real good. - Sure glad to see you. - Nice to see you. Hello. - When did you get in? - Last night. We got your entry. Got you down for the bronc riding... the bull dogging, the bull riding... and the wild cow milking. You can put my dad's name down for the wild cow milking... and I'll do the mugging. That sounds great. Good to see you and your dad together again. Thank you. - What did that come to, Frances? - 125. 125 out of 150. OK, 25, plus 6, 7, 8, 9... and 30. And 20 makes 50. We sure thank you. Punch all those bulls in the morning about 10:00. - I'll be there. - Real good. You haven't seen my dad around, have you? No, I sure haven't. I saw Curly yesterday, though. I bet he'd know where he is. Much obliged. - We sure thank you. - Thank you. - See you later, now. - All right. Yeah, war paint. Good morning, Red. J.R. You got Pontiac and Chino Valley. Yep. Yeah. I didn't see you around the palace. I slept outside. Lend me $15, Red. You already owe me 25. Well, that's 40. You got change? Well, now, I'll get it. Hey, come around tonight, and I'll win that back from you. Hey, yeah, why don't you stick around, J.R.? Are you coming? I tell you what we could do... if y'all get your car and everything... All right. See ya. Big hearted, ain't he? Yeah, Red. Heart almost as big as yours. Hey, York, Buck Roan still around? No, he went down to the palace. Hey, J.R. Hello. - Ben. - Good to see you. - Nice to see you. - Welcome home, J.R. Good to be home, Del. Thanks. First drink's on the house. Well, that's a change, isn't it? Two beers. Dos cervezas. Yes, ma'am. Sure been a spell, J.R. For mi amigo. Tome mucho. You betcha. Hey, you girls. Will you go home and get your IDs? Just go home and get legal, will you, please? You always say that, Del. Yeah, the sweetest things. See you later. J.R. Hello, Homer, Red. Hi, J.R. - You want a beer? - Don't mind if I do. Why not? I can't dance. Hey, Buck, I'll be right there. I'm not going anywhere. You ready for another? Just leave her on the bar. Del. Don't you know it? Fine. Have a seat. Sit down. How you feeling? Not bad. Not bad. You act like you're hurting. I'm just fine. You contracting the Salinas show, are you... after you close out here? Hell, I got to go on to Cheyenne... and rest my stock a little bit. You looking forward to riding for your hometown folks? Yeah. Me and my dad are gonna be working... the cow milking together. Well, that's a pair to draw to. Well, that's me and Ace, all right. Money? Well, money's nobody's favor, Buck... but I want to ride that Sunshine bull of yours again. The way your luck's running... you're just liable to draw him again. I just don't want to be counting on my luck. You know I don't set the draw, Junior. Now, listen, most cowboys would pay you to stay off that bull. I don't suppose you're thinking about paying me... to draw him for you, are you? Well, it's just like I said... money's nobody's favor. I'll be damned if you're not serious. Just one of him and one of me. Look, Junior, neither me or my bull... aim to make a living off another fella's pride. Now, you might as well face it. You're just not the rider you was a few years back. I need it, Buck. It's my hometown. Talk to him on your time, J.R. He's on my time now. Right, Buck? That's right. You heard what the man said. I got to go to work before somebody else gets his money. Maybe you'll get lucky in Salinas, J.R. Yeah. - Hey, Red. - Yeah. Come on. I'll ride that bull for half the prize money. You sure are a man of confidence. And mighty generous, too. That's me, Buck... Just full of confidence. I'll give you that. Come on, Buck. We're all set up. Deal the cards, boys. Now, easy, boy. I'm one of the good guys. Go ahead. He's your pa's dog, all right. He'll either shake your hand or bite it off. Well, let's see. You're lookin' just fine, sugar. Come on, now. Here, let me have those tomatoes. Yeah. You farming now, are you? Sure as hell am tryin'. What's the old man's dog doin' here? Waitin' on him to get out of that hospital, that's what. Well, what's he doing there? He ran off the Cherry Creek Road last night. Was he drinking? What do you think? Totalled his truck. Is he OK? He's fine. The thing is, the devil sure takes care of his own. I went up to the ranch looking for Ace... and somebody's turned that place into a gravel pit. - Did you know that? - Yeah. Curly. Ace sold out to him. He got this notion to prospect for silver up in Tonopah. And then he left with 15,000 in his jeans. That's all Curly paid him for that land, is $15,000? That's all. Four sections up there. I know. Curly and Ruth still run that place up the highway? They're the two busiest people in this county. Curly started a mobile home development... on the ranch right in back of the trading post. And he isn't stopping there. Junior... where are you going to stop? Well, about that money I haven't been paying you... looks like there's gonna continue to be... an interruption there. Is that what it's called? A continued interruption? Well, don't worry about it. It doesn't matter. Your brother is taking care of things. He's selling this place, is he? Why not? Mobile homes are the thing of the future. Yeah. Curly coming to supper tonight? Yeah. I think he wants to see you. OK. You and Ace. Maybe you're the lucky ones, drifting the way you do. Maybe. How long you been keeping boarders, Mom? A year. - Where you going? - I'm going up to the hospital. Figures. See you tonight. Is he hurt bad? I can keep him off the ceiling... but I can't keep his hands off me. Come back in the morning. He was asking for you. When he wakes up, you tell him I'm around, would you? Folks, if you gather around... I'd like to tell you a few words about the Reata Rancheros. Now, the Bonner Trading Post was established in 1955. It was ten years before the last clean air in America... was reportedly seen in Flagstaff, Arizona. I'm no fancy scientist. I'm just a United States businessman... and I'm proud of it. But I'll guarantee you... Prescott's air is as clean or cleaner... than our illustrious neighbor to the north. We have an air-conditioned chartered bus over here... to take you for a free tour of the Reata Rancheros. And we have these lovely young ladies in hot pants... passing out free maps and brochures. You'll find at the Reata Rancheros... Come to the bus. It's about ready to load. Pick up a brochure on your way out. Would you like a cookie before you leave? And total, but I mean total, electric living. Now, I hope you enjoy the free lemonade... and cookies courtesy of Curly Bonner's Trading Post. Bonnie, Toby. Excuse me, folks. Step right this way, ladies and gentlemen... for a home on the range retirement... just ten minutes from city shopping. Hey, Junior. How you doin', boy? Good to see you. Yeah? Hey, yeah. How's that rodeo life been treating you? I got no complaints. Curly, what are you doin'? Hey, boy, I'm just making money hand over fist. You wait until you see what I got lined up for you. Hey, girls, let's roll 'em, huh? You just gonna love what's happening here. I'll see you at Mom's tonight. 7:00 dinner, sharp. Let's go, ladies and gentlemen. Come on! Step aboard, folks. Come on, now. Everyone, let's go. The bus is loadin'. Here you go. Let me help you there, ma'am. Come on down the highway In the twilight of your life Come and see Reata Rancheros Come and bring your wife Bring the little children, too Because when they've all grown up... Then with the house gone, then there's no problem. Here, things are gonna be better all the way around. Mama's going to be living inside of model home trailers. Well, Mom can show the people... how roomy and comfortable their lives can be on our Rancheros. And she can be in charge of our gift shop. That would really give her a chance... to get rid of some of these antiques. Mom, do you have to smoke while you're feeding our baby? Almost forgot, boys. Here's a couple of free ones... Best seats in the house. Gee, thanks, Uncle Junior. Now, you pass your Uncle Junior those mashed potatoes and gravy. You get some good draws for tomorrow, Uncle Junior? You better believe. You could ride anything with hair on it, Uncle Junior. Well, you pays your money, you takes your chances. Pass the whiskey. There never was a horse that couldn't be rode... there never was a cowboy that couldn't be throwed. Famous old saying, all right. Well, Curly says that you've seen one rodeo... you've seen 'em all. Well, I didn't mean our rodeo, darling. That's a part of history. Well, still, it's just a rodeo. So, you went to see him? Yeah. How much was it that you paid for the old man's land? 15,000. Yeah, which he proceeded to gamble... and throw away in Nevada. But he had to quit prospecting... twenty feet away from mother lode, just like always. It don't seem much. 2,600 acres. Well, now he's got this scheme to go to Australia. Well, why don't you send him? Come on, Junior. I put him on a weekly allowance... and that's that, and I told him so. You know what I mean? Yeah. Why don't you start thinkin'... about your own self for a change? You may not know it... but you are in the right place at the right time. It's here. It's a regular land boom, Junior. Yeah, I saw your wide open spaces. You know less about wide open spaces than I do. I know it here... Where it is. You're just some kind of motel cowboy. 15,000 just seems a little bit short. 15 or 30,000, he still would've blown it all. Now, he needed the money fast, and I got it for him. Me. I just want you to get a grip on your future. I want you to come work for me. You want me to help you sell the old man's land? Our land. Junior... What a salesman you'd make for the Rancheros. Big cowboy like you... sincere... and you're genuine as a sunrise. Well, there's no point in foolin' ourselves... now, is there? You got to ride. Giddyap, giddyap. Got to ride. That's right, Curly. Salinas, California. Day after tomorrow. Will you think on what I said? I just don't want you turnin' out like the old man... Curly! Curly, what's happened?! My God, you've killed him! Damn, what a lickin'. Junior... Don't say it. I'm goin'. And I'll send somebody over tomorrow to fix that window. And you take his damn dog with you! You just can't walk out of here. You see my feet on the floor, don't you, Arlis? Now watch my legs make 'em move. But you're not well enough! I'm heaven-bound, sweetheart, but not today. Get that cleaned up, will you, please? Junior was in yesterday, and he said he was coming back. Well, he'll find me, or I'll find him. Bye-bye, sweetheart. Ace, you get back in this room. I'll use force if I have to. You're not leaving this hospital... no matter what. Orderly! Orderly, stop this man! Stop him! I don't fight fair, boys! And you are a fool, Ace Bonner! Adios, sweet angel of mercy. Where to? To the rodeo, partner. Where the hell else? - Mornin'. - Mornin'. Well, do I get that draw, or don't I? I been thinkin' on it, Junior. Kick in the head, Junior. That's what it's about. You know, Junior, if a man was going to expand his business... I'm talkin' more shows and more towns... He might be interested in an assistant. Say, a fella that'd been around some. A champion in his day. Well, I just thought I'd mention it. Don't think so, Buck. You had breakfast? Nope. How about we go down here and get a little bread and gravy? That'll be fine right there. Keep the change, son. Hey, dog. Where you been? Stay here, boy. Hey, you pretty little girls... you look like you might've seen Junior Bonner. No, but I'd be glad to give him any message... anytime. Now, how'd I know you was gonna say that? Who do you suppose he is? All those contestants planning to ride in the parade... please assemble at the south parking lot. Come on, come on. Let's get on the float, OK? Ace Bonner slept here. He said he'd find you. Here you go. I'll make sure he takes his medicine. Hi, Ace. Hey, Roy. Are you still livin'? Still around and kickin'. How you been makin' it? Better than I deserve. Goin' down to get in the big parade? Don't you know it? How many we rode in, Roy? Not enough, Ace. Not enough and maybe too many, huh? Too many, probably. I wonder if I can hold him off that first narrow. I think I got company. Hey, pretty little girls... I want you to meet Mr. Ace Bonner. - How do you do, Mr. Bonner? - Howdy. No. That's me. You J.R.'s dad? I used to be. Didn't I, Roy? That's right. Come on, let me show you the way into town. Afraid we'll get lost? No, I'm afraid I'm gonna lose you. - So long, Roy. - So long, Ace. No way, not me. Hey. Johnny Muller. Where's my horse? Ace Bonner. Ace? You fellas just sit around and let him take it? Yeah. Have we got all our bull riders here? 'Cause I'm closin' the books. - Yeah. - Yeah. OK, well, here's what we got today for you boys. OK, Jones... number 46... Spike. Tom Acuff. Number 16, Tom... Tojo. OK, Jimmy Morgan... number 86... Buttermilk. Terwiliger, Red Terwiliger... number 35... Thunderbolt. Thunderbolt? It's all right, Red. You'll make him look good. Just watch it, J.R., if you got time. I got the time. Bonner... draws number 62, Sunshine. That's Sunshine twice in one week, J.R. I'll buy you some more tape. - All right, Red. - Where you goin'? I gotta go find my dad. He stole my horse. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Prescott, Arizona... and the 84th annual Frontier Days celebration... and the national Fourth of July parade. The grand marshal in this Frontier Days parade... Mr. Casey Tibbs. How you doing, Casey? Welcome to Prescott. There's Ace Bonner. Hi, Ace! Where you been? Hey, Ace! If you're still on your feet... remember, that first dance is mine! I'll do 'er. Howdy, folks.

Prescott's junior high school band. Seen the old man? Yeah, he's up ahead between the Indians and the flag. I'm gonna whip your ass, Junior. Well, somebody is. It ain't gonna be the first time. Hi, Bonnie. Howdy, J.R. - How you doin'? - Fine. Hello, Ruth. J.R. You always did love a parade, Ellie. You always did sit a good horse, Ace. Where'd you steal it? We'd certainly like to thank... the Air Force band for being with us today. Ladies and gentlemen... Hello, cowboy. I like your horse, Ace. So do I. Climb aboard. Are you sober? I'm as sober as the day you met me. I've been tryin' to find you all day. I was lookin' for you. You stole my horse, Ace. Ladies and gentlemen, Yavapai County's own Ace Bonner! And, riding with Ace Bonner, his boy J.R. Bonner... twice Frontier Days champion bull rider! Let's hear it! I got a bottle, Ace. You want a drink? Watch them drunken idiots! That's Junior's old man! Watch out! Don't run over 'em! And here's Curly of Reata Rancheros! How you doin', Curly? Ace! Ace! Hey, hold on! What's the matter, son, don't you like us? All right, Ace, let me up in the saddle, damn it. Come on, you get up here where you belong! - No, you ride in the back. - Mind your dad! Yeah! Easy! Great. Come on, get up here, cowboy. Get that damn horse outta my yard! I'm really sorry, ma'am. For Christ's sake. We're goin'. You're gonna get us killed, Ace. Yeah. - I gotta sit down. - You and me. Well, you fall off better than I do. Yeah. That's the best ride I've had... since Christmas Eve in Tonopah... and I was snowed in. Bobbie's? Me and the buckeye. She sends her regards. Oh, yeah. You ever hear from Johnny Mars? Yeah. He's bustin' horses out of Carlsbad. Still makes the El Paso show. And Buddy Cox... always hollered, "As long as women live..." "my name will never die." Well, he's dead, Dad. Car crashed between Abilene and Dallas. Well, I hear you're doin' very well. Where'd you hear that? Takin' care of Mom, are you? Not much. She's sellin' antiques out the townhouse. She's happy- She's livin' right where she wanted to live all her life... Right in the middle of things. Curly's gonna sell that house. Put her in a curio shop. Curly's doin' right well. Junior... I'm goin' to Australia. What are you gonna do, hunt kangaroos? Gold for the findin', that's what. 150,000 square miles to prospect. And sheep. Marino. Finest wool in the world. I already made the down payment. How would you like to come down there with me? Hell, I know you can't make it. Not a big rodeo star. But at least you could grubstake your dad. I'd make you partner number one, Junior. Partner number one. What do you say to that? There's somethin' I gotta tell you. No, somethin' I gotta tell you... about mining. There's a lot to learn. Rare metals... big future. I'm busted, Ace. Of course, you never tried your hand at prosp... Busted? Flatter than a tire. Well, all I need is 5,000. Heh. How about five million? Well, it's time to go to work. If you're not too old to rope. I'll do the muggin'. Got us entered. - Wild cow milkin'? - You bet. Come on. Curly paid you the money for the land, Pop. What'd you do with it? The honest intentions of a man... trying to make money with money. The unfortunate prey... to the evils of nighttime ladies and neon lights. But, no, sir, no matter what he says... not penny one from Curly will I take. And I mean that. Because... Ace, one more parade. Come ride in the grand entry with us. Can I steal your horse again, Junior? What's mine is yours. Busted? Opportunity of a lifetime. Come on, girls. All bronc riders report... Acuff, Terwiliger, Carson, and Bonner. Damn it. Well, if it isn't Junior Bonner. Hey, folks, this is Junior Bonner. Burt Hunsacker. You remember me. Six years ago, a little place in Nogales. Right after the Tuscon show? Six years is a long time. But you're sure lookin' good, Burt. Here's your grand entry... for this, the 84th annual Frontier Days Rodeo... The oldest professional rodeo in America. It was on July 4th, 1888... that cowboys from the surrounding ranches... first gave as an entertainment to the people of Prescott... an exhibition of ranch activities... and cowboy sports... Hi, J.R. The Prescott Frontier Days celebration... is the original cowboy rodeo in America... and in the years since, it has continued to be... one of the most honored and well-known rodeos in America. Hey, Bill, let me have that rope, will ya? I should mention here that if any of you... were at the big parade downtown earlier this morning... and are wondering if that fella in the blue shirt... on the Roan horse is gonna compete today... I can tell you he will. Ace Bonner will be a contestant in today's rodeo. He's been a part of the rodeo for 42 years. Now here's the grand marshal of this year's rodeo... twice world champion, all-around-cowboy Casey Tibbs. Our rodeo stud contractor... the man responsible for all the bucking horses... steers, and bulls you're about to see... Buck Roan. Buck Roan of Amarillo, Texas. And here's a pair of fellas... who'll be entertaining you this afternoon... Tom Lucia... and joining Tom... the clown bull fighter from Enid, Oklahoma... Jim Hill. All right, Tom. Hold it. Better save that for the Palace bar. All right. There's $5,000 total prize money... waiting on these cowboys today... so let's get to the first event... Saddle bronc riding. Number three, J.R. Bonner... on a bronc named... Hold it, J.R. Don't start your ride till the gate's open. Get down on it easy, J.R. Don't make no noise on that gate. Don't ask for it. Just... Put him out, J.R.! That a boy! Rake him, rake him! That a boy! A good ride and a good try, J.R... but a little short. Let's have a hand for J.R. Bonner. You know somethin', Ace? Old Junior's gonna spoil all my horses... if he don't quit blindfoldin' 'em with his ass. Can't win it that way, J.R. No, you can't win 'em all, partner. Good ride. The score for Bobby Fenly was 62. Steer Wrestling. Here's an event that requires perfect timing... on a straight run. Bulldogger jumps from his horse... grabs the steer by the horns... stops him, and puts him down. That's that. And as far as I know... the steer is still runnin'. $850 total first prize money. J.R. Bonner... Red Terwiliger doing the hazing. Steer number 42. You're up, J.R. - Ready, J.R.? - Yep. You're up. All right. The boys are ready. Good time for J.R. A mighty fast time. The best so far today... 8 and 2/10 seconds. 8.2 for J.R. Bonner. Now the boys will switch around... with J.R. Doing the hazing for Red Terwiliger. You gonna beat J.R.'s time, Red? Steer 38! Red Terwiliger! He did it. Time for Red Terwiliger... 6 and 5/10 seconds. Tough luck, cowboy. It happens all the time, dude. I'll tell you what... If you were to take a cattle stampede... and cross it with a barroom brawl... you just might come up with something... resembling our next event... Wild cow milking... Now, don't you wait for my loop to settle, Junior. I'm accurate number one, so the minute I throw... you get your tail in motion, boy. And then I'll do my thing, as they say. Before we turn loose those boys... we got penned in that circle over there... They're the muggers, and it's the muggers's job... to hang on and slow down the cow... while the roper gets down from his horse... and handles the milking chores. You muggers and ropers remember whose team it is, won't you? All right, turn the cows loose. Here they come. Rope 'em down. Over here, Junior! Here's your place. Over here, Ace! Come on, Ace! That dog bit me again! Get that dog outta here! Not our cow, you knothead! Damn it. Get that yellow son of a bitch outta here. Come on, Ace! Hang on to her, Junior. I gotta fill it up again! Gimme another shot at it. - Come on, Ace! - All right. One more second. OK! Hey! Hey, look out! - Give me the bottle! - No, no, no, I got it! Come on, gimme that bottle! Gimme the bottle! I got it! The winning team is Rudy Martinez and Ray Poole. Will somebody get that damn dog? We could've won. We did, Ace. How about a special hand now... for the oldest contestant? Ace Bonner... Sixty years young and still going strong. And will somebody get that dog the hell out of here? That concludes the first half of our performance. We're going to take a break now. See you all back here at 3:30 for the concluding events... in our Fourth of July Frontier Days Rodeo. So, what happened to her? Just one of those things you grin at and drink to. Into the mouth and over the gums... look out, stomach, here she comes. Lord, but that does heal the aches of a loser. If this world's all about winners... what's for the losers? Well, somebody's gotta hold the horses, Ace. You're right. See you fellas later. Now, you're gonna be there... when I deal with that bull of yours, ain't you, Buck? Yeah, Junior, I'll be there. Well, don't look at me, boy. I don't make no decisions with a drink in my hand. Then you'd better put that drink down... 'cause you've got company, Ace. He's in the navy now, Elvira. Just home on leave. That's fine, just fine. Gentle Jesus, meek and mild, I'm in trouble, son. Take a deep seat, Ace. If this is any of your idea... I'll blister your tail from here to next Wednesday. You're not nervous, are you, Ace? Hi, Junior! Hi, Grandpa! How've you been? Come on up here. You, too. Golly, I missed you. Did you kill any lions? Did you find any silver? Hello, Ace. Mrs. Bonner. Lookin' very well. You don't look so bad yourself, considerin'. Dad, could we have a drink, please? We're thirsty. Yeah, please, Dad. We're awful thirsty. Why, sure you can. We'll all have ourselves a drink. - Del? - Yes, sir. Beers all around for these midgets. Ace, Cokes. - A round for me and my boys. - Comin' up. - Ruth? - No. Beer is fine. Ellie, I seem to recall... you had an occasional taste for bourbon whiskey. Didn't think you'd remember. Who could forget? It was a nice float you had, Curly. Finished second in the commercial division. Well, second's better than third. Ellie. Thanks. This calls for a toast. We are all together. You're up, Ace. Well, since I am top of the pile... to them as has their roads ahead. Ace? Our dance. Arlis. Well, you all know Arlis here. I've heard the name. Hello, Mrs. Bonner. Our dance, Ace. Didn't you always save the first dance for Mom, Ace? It's a good idea, Ace. Boys, times have changed. I changed them. Dance with her, Ace. Sweet combination. I can't dance with both of you. Come on, sweetheart, let's cut it together. Curly. Come on, kids. You want a beer, Curly? Just like old times. Now would you like a beer? Junior, you're my brother... and I guess I love you. Well, we're family. I don't care what you do. You can sell one lot or a hundred lots. I'm just tryin' to keep us together. I gotta go down my own road. What road? I'm workin' on my first million... and you're still workin' on eight seconds. Curly? Come on. Come on, let's dance. Here's a little song I wrote for all the rodeo hands. It's called "Rodeo Man." I'll be in town this weekend, honey Look for me downtown Anytime after the band starts playin' I'll be around I'll park my two-horse trailer Up at the rodeo grounds Then I'll start roarin' I'm the rodeo man I picked up 35 bucks in Reno Couldn't get a decent ride But I'll do all right in the Frontier Days Unless all the good bulls die I was raised in the town of Prescott I got my home folks on my side I'm gonna win top money I'm a rodeo man Gonna enter in the broncs and the ropin' On Saturday afternoon And the bull ridin' in the night show While the band plays a cowboy tune And if I could just draw me a mean one Then stick on it just like glue... Champagne. And three double bourbons. I'm a rodeo man When my last ride's over And my ribs are all taped down I'll pick up my top money buckle And, honey, we'll head for town... Dance with me? You do dance, don't you? You're a little out of line, Junior. Not really. I'll dance with him. Yeah! Hey, how about playin' somethin' a little bit slower? One dance, Junior. I can't count much further. Today I Started lovin' you Again And I'm right back Where I really ought to be... Hey, J.R., where'd you get the new doll? What you doin', Casey? That's a young filly I picked up down in Cheyenne. Just long enough To let my heartache mend Then today I started loving you Again I got over you... Hey, you mind if I cut in J.R.? Well, I'll tell you the truth, Red. I kinda do. Nothin' personal. Well, I hope she treats you better than Sunshine. So do I, Red. Who's the Sunshine in your life? Just the bull I'll be ridin'. Thank you, J.R. Hi, sweetheart. Anybody ever tell you... - You get. - What? Come on, I mean it. Red's at it again! Hold it! Hold it down! You fight like my old lady, Red! We can't have no fightin' around here. Come on, Terwiliger! Watch him, Buck! - What's your name? - Charmagne. Why do they call you Junior? Well, I tell you the truth, I don't know. - It got stuck, huh? - Yeah. Oh, no! You from Phoenix? Curly Bonner smacks the gringos! You work down here, do you? In the bank. It's not very exciting compared to what you do, is it? Well, not unless you own the bank. Misdeal. My old lady's over there, you know that? Hey, sweet cheeks! Come on, let's get out of here! Go on. Get the kids! I watched you today. You were pretty good. I fall off a lot, don't I? Keep clear, boys. My dog don't fight fair. Do you always run with that crowd? No. Anyway, it looks like this crowd may not make it. No, I don't think so. Eat it! Eat! You got a girl? Why? Why not? I'm just passing through. Where to? I'm goin' up to Salinas, El Paso, down to Fort Worth. Just like old times. Driving cowboy. Stop it! Stop it! Better hold up there! I think it's time to play something patriotic fellas. Yeah, hold it, hold it. Let's do "The Star Spangled Banner". Stop! No! OK? Stop! Hey, Curtiss, let's have a drink, huh? The fightin' excitement's all over with. Here we go. - Thank you. - You betcha. Think I'm feeling a little better... now I'm drinking this beer. Yeah? What are you chasin' all the girls for? I love 'em. No, no, Del, it wasn't no bronc, but a bull. Name of Holy Joe. You remember him, Roy? Yeah, I remember him. Old Holy Joe... Blind in one eye... meaner than a boot full of barbed wire. He sent a lot of good hands to church. Made more than one cowboy do a little praying. Well, sir, I wanted to draw on that bull the whole year. And don't you know... when we got to the Madison Square Garden... by God, I got him. I told Mr. Jack Dempsey... in this restaurant the night before... We was introduced as one champ to another... I told him if he wanted to see a real fight... he ought to see me and that bull go eight seconds. Well, I rode that bull... and after eight seconds... there were 16,423 big city dudes... standing on their feet and hollering my name. That was the last time, though. Ellie? Excuse me, boys. Ellie, where you going? Did you hear me, Ellie? I asked you where you were going. To get some air. Now, wait on me, honey. I want to talk with you. By hook or by crook, I'm going to Australia. Well, you always were good at putting distance between us. Now, look, honey... don't turn your back on me. I'm askin', what's a man to do? Silver all shot to hell, no more bounty on the lions. Hey, you know, you could go down there with me. Ace, why don't you just shut up? She's sure got a case of the knits, don't she? Australia. Silver in Nevada. You are a broken record, Ace. Now, quiet down, honey. We don't want our wash hung out in public. Why the hell should I be quiet? - Now, listen, honey... - You listen... 'cause I just don't give a damn anymore. As far as I'm concerned... you can go to hell or Australia, but not with me. Well, they're both down under. Dreams, sweet talk... That's all you are. If you stay with me... I'll sweeten the dreams, too. Remember? Well, sure as hell, I had that coming. You sure as hell did. But I'm leaving for good, Ellie... and I mean it this time. Then all we got left is today. Well, anyway, Ellie... you seen one rodeo, you seen 'em all. Yeah. Sure. The time for Billy Longer and C.T. Jones... 16 and 4/10 seconds. 16.4. Our next ropers... A pair of Casa Grande, Arizona cowboys... Jim Carter and Paul Arnold, looking to beat 16.4. Bring the bulls on! The winning time so far, 15 and 3/10 seconds. 15.3 for Jim Carter and Paul Arnold. Get him in there! Next up, Bob Malone of Mayer, Arizona... and Al Gardner of Dewey, Arizona. Let's go, J.R. Our final pair of ropers in team tying... Henry Thompson of Florence, Arizona... B.W. White of Phoenix. Well, you couldn't make it much closer. 15 and 4/10 seconds. Better pull your hat down today, pard. We'll move along to the final event on today's program... Bull riding, the most dangerous event in rodeo. In order to qualify for prize money... the cowboy must stay aboard a twisting half-ton of fury... for eight seconds. You know, successful or thrown in his ride... the safety of our bull riders today... may well depend on the daring of our rodeo clowns. Scoring in this event is similar... to saddle and bareback bronc riding. Our 2 judges can score up to 25 points... on the performance of the bull and the cowboy. First place money, $950. OK, the boys in the chutes say they're ready to go. Hold on, J.R.! Well, that's the luck of the draw, Bob. Speaking of luck, it's J.R. Bonner's luck... to have drawn the country's number one bucking bull... undefeated in 29 rides... The 29th of which was, you guessed it, J.R. Bonner. Four days later, right here in his hometown of Prescott... this former bull riding champion... is now back to try Buck Roan's... Old J.R. Bonner on Old Sunshine. Come on! How about that ride, folks? J.R. Has done it. He's the first man ever to ride Old Sunshine... and a dandy ride it was. Well, our rodeo judges scored 92 points on that ride... 92 points for J.R. Bonner. That's going to make him about $950 richer. Folks, that's the last ride of the day. - That was a hell of a ride, J.R. - Well, it's about time. This was some way to end... the 84th annual Frontier Days Rodeo. I think you'll agree with me that after 84 years... they still make cowboys as tough as they ever did. We'd like to thank the Prescott... Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Chaparral airlines flight 417 for Phoenix and Tucson... is now boarding. Passengers holding tickets may board through gate number five. Passengers holding space... on the continuation of flight 417... please have your tickets ready at the gate. Rodeo time. I got to get it on down the road. So long. Ma? Ma? Junior. You had to win, didn't you? Yeah. So long, Mom. Hey, Junior! Junior! Hey, Junior! Don't you hear me, boy? I'm sure you're going to enjoy yourself. Thank you. Good morning. I'd like a one-way ticket to Sydney, Australia... A man and a dog. All right. Economy will cost you $585... and first class is $798... plus $40 for the animal. - Write it first class. - All right. Put that in the name of Mr. Ace Bonner. And you can have it delivered to him at the Palace bar. All right. Here's your money. Who shall we say paid for the ticket? Tell 'em Junior sent you.
