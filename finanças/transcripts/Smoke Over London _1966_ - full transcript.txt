- Can you see daddy? - No, I can't see anything. But it should work. Try again. There they are, my two children, Teresa and Carluccio. They're looking at me with a telescope. Can you see inside? What's dad doing? - I can't focus. - Can you see him or not? Yes. - Let me see. - I'll send him a kiss. I shouldn't have let him leave, he shouldn't have left. Lady Anna, it wasn't possible any more, that a man as refined as him, such an expert in his field, couldn't go on living without ever having been to England at least once, right? It's all your fault, Count Paul, and those vagabond friends of yours. You spend all day talking about umbrellas and bowler hats. You talk and talk... I can't hear what my wife is saying to my best friend, Count Paul, but I can guess. My wife is a good woman, simple, but also a little ignorant. I am an expert antiques dealer. I couldn't go on living without ever going to England. The country we men of refinement consider our second home. Nevertheless, now that this huge beast has started moving and I can no longer see my wife and children, I really feel like getting off! And I don't know why! He's scared, I tell you, he's scared. If he could, he'd jump out of there like a cricket. At this this time, there can be no place in Dante's soul for a lowly and childish sensation like fear. There he goes. In an hour and fifty minutes our Dante will set foot on our dear old England. Let's go. Come on, we have to get to Perugia. Start walking. British passengers to the right, foreign passengers, this way. - Are you separating us? - Yes. All mine. We're taking these. You're only allowed one carton and one bottle. I'm so sorry! It's my first time in England. I don't know your laws, but I have the greatest admiration for you. - Then open everything. - Everything? Everything. I didn't realize. I told the driver 49 Park Lane. This is 49 Park Lane. But this can't be the little Queen's hotel. It was here 20 years ago. Now we have the London Hilton. - This way, Sir. - How strange. - This is your room, sir. - Yes, I can see. No, never mind. I prefer to do it myself. - I'm not unpacking your suitcase. - No? Then what are you doing? I must check for cameras and binoculars. - Why? - Do you see down there? - The palace where the queen lives? - Yes, this is why. - Now do you understand? - No, I don't understand. Journalists and photographers, with their equipment have invaded the Queen's privacy. Criticising and publishing, without any respect, images that were less than flattering for such individuals. - Her Majesty wasn't amused. - She's right, poor lady. But why did the owner of this land build a skyscraper right here? The land belonged to the Queen, she gave permission to build it. - Then why is she complaining? - That's what we're wondering as well. You deserve a tip. Your welcome. What a wonderful world. Dante Fontana - Antiques Hello? Hello? Who? Mr. Dante? From London? How is that possible? They're still not back, maybe because of the fog. No. I had such a fright when I heard your voice. I'll take care of it, don't worry. - Your husband just called. - How is that possible? - I told you he'd get there first. - He was surprised you weren't back. He asked about you and your friends. When I told him about the fog here, he laughed and said: "It's sunny over here, I can even see the Queen from my window". - Let's go. Bring me the key later. - Yes, madam. Did he speak English? Had he already changed? These are the things you put in his head. - "He can see the Queen." - Poor Dante. Don't worry about Anna, it's just the way she is... She always wants the last word. What can you do? She's no different to before, she hasn't changed. - She's so set in her ways. - A drink? I can't imagine what Dante must be up to now. I can tell you where he is now. Only a few minutes till noon. Where else can he be? St. James' Street. Stand next to the guy in the bowler hat otherwise they won't believe we're in London. Next to him. I'm sorry, mister, just a moment. - Italians? From the south? - Yes, sir. Ready? Behave. Don't show us up for what we really are. Who is he? It got caught... my umbrella. The ticket. Are you Italian? - Yes, I'm Italian. - I don't like Italians. Why? An Italian tried to strangle me during the war. With that neck? Who was this Italian? Where can I find a good restaurant? All the restaurants are good around here. But they're all Italian! Well... I'm Italian and I'm tired of Italian food. Please, tell me where I can find a typical English restaurant. - To do what? - To eat. We have fresh clams in oil straight from the sea. What would you like, ma'am? Something I'd been dreaming of all my life. Visiting Christie's. The most famous auction house in the world. My dream was about to come true. Congratulations. Do you think I paid too much for that? I don't know much about the period. Modest and cautious! Two virtues I lack! But you must have many others. - I wouldn't know, Mister... - Fontana. Fontana? - Then you're Italian? - From Perugia. I have so many happy memories of your city. Many years ago, in Warsaw I met a marquis Fontana, in your embassy. A relative of yours, perhaps? - He was my uncle. - Was? I'm so sorry. I realised straight away that you weren't an antiques dealer. My niece Lady Rachel and Baroness Charlotte Swinburn. The Marquis of Fontana. - What interests you in particular? - Something special? In this auction? Or in life in general? - Very witty. - Very wary too. Yes, look. 136... Bust of a woman, fragment of Etruscan sculpture. No, it's deplorable. What did I say? I hope you're happy. Your little whim has cost me an extra Â£300. It wasn't a whim, I came here from Italy for that fragment. I've been looking for it for years, I own the rest of the pieces of the urn. You're obviously talking about a copy, I own the original. I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I own the original. Rubbish, my father found it in a newly discovered Etruscan tomb. He was passionate about Etruscan art. Newly discovered Etruscan tombs are very rare. My father was a specialist. If he was a specialist, my father certainly wasn't naive. - I'm not questioning that but... - Are you sure you have the original? How long are you staying in London? - I leave tomorrow. - What a pity. I have guests coming to my castle tomorrow and my painter of seasons is going fox hunting. I would love to have invited you to show you that experts like you and your father can be wrong. Then I accept your invitation without hesitation. I'm really delighted! We'll be expecting you tomorrow at Belvoir Castle. And if my piece is a fake, I shall give you a nice reward. Your invitation is a reward in itself! - See you tomorrow. - Yes. Don't forget: Grantham Belvoir Castle. There's a train that arrives at ten in the morning. My driver will be waiting for you at the station. Grantham Belvoir Castle. It seemed too good to be true. An English duchess had invited me to her English castle. I was scared it was all a dream and I'd wake up in Perugia. These children start wearing top hats at primary school. That's why they know how to wear them when they grow up. That's why they're so well-educated. There's so much talk about school reform in Italy. Here's the first and most important one, the top hat. We are missing the top hat in Italy. And these girls... With such deep and pure eyes. - Are you alone? - Yes, why? We were expecting an Italian guest. - Are you expecting anyone else? - An Italian, but I don't see him. He was supposed to be on this train. He must have missed it. Italians are never on time. Too right! Shall we go then, Miss Elizabeth? Of course! What's the point of waiting? Is Belvoir Castle very far? You're Italian? You look like a real Englishman. - What a wonderful compliment. - Not really, the car's already left. It doesn't matter, I'll find another way. There's only one other way, on foot. - Excuse me, soldier. - Can I help you? - Do you know Belvoir castle? - Keep going straight. I live near the castle, I used to play in the grounds when I was a child. My name's Rock and I'm Scottish. I can see that, my name's Dante, I'm from Perugia. - That's my house. - Congratulations. - Your father's calling you. - That's my wife. Take that road down there, past the forest... You'll see the castle. I have to get to work and the house is still a mess. The boy needs changing. Bye, I'm going. You're always going around with those damned bagpipes, hurry up. Dante. Wives are terrible. You're telling me. Excuse me? It's a long way, you feel it more walking. - Your suitcase, please. - Very kind of you. It's four shillings, not two. - Four? I'm sorry. There. - This way. Fancy that! Who's that? How do you do? Dante Fontana. It's out in the garden, you can't see it from here. - What? - The fountain. My name, Dante Fontana. - Fontana. - What does he want? - I don't know. - I was saying, my name is Dante Fontana. - Why are you telling us? - Shouldn't I? Holbein, portrait of Henry VIII, King of England. Come, Mouse. Sorry, sir. You're not allowed to sit on those chairs. They're 18th century Roman chairs. - I see a catalogue. - Yes. - May I? - Please. 5 shillings, Sir. I like the way he asks! You give him 2, he wants 4, you give him 3, he wants 5! Ladies and Gentlemen, follow me. This way, please. Shall we go? This room is dedicated to Elizabeth, the Duchess of Bradford. It's one of the most spectacular rooms in the castle. The decorations and the bust of the Duchess are by Matthew Wyatt who also painted the ceiling. And now, you may have the privilege of seeing the Duchess and her guests. See down below? They're preparing for the fox hunt. - Sorry, is her Grace there? - Yes. In a top hat? Is she riding? No, Her Grace only follows the hunt. If you'd like to follow me, we shall visit the armoury. Duchess! You see me? Dante Fontana. - Tourists are absolutely forbidden... - I'm calling the Duchess! Come along. Tourists may not enter the private area! But I'm not a tourist, I'm a guest. - A guest? - Of course. I was personally invited by Her Grace. How can that be? I would have been told. Such a mistake has never happened. - What is your name, sir? - Fontana, Dante. - Marquis Dante Fontana? - That's me. - I'm terribly sorry. - It doesn't matter. You've given me the opportunity to see the castle. Follow me, I'll show you to your room. - Let's go. - An unforgivable mistake. Do not despair, I've already forgotten and forgiven you. Who's that? A page boy? I'll inform Her Grace of your arrival. We were expecting you on the ten o'clock train. I know, there was a misunderstanding. This is the Rubens room, each room is distinguished by the painting in it. - This one is by Rubens. - Yes, I know the painting but it's not by Rubens. - No, it's someone from his school. - You're quite right. Not one of the best either, you're a fine connoisseur of art. Modestly speaking. Let me give you this. Is that all right? Most generous of you. Thank you, my Lord. - Your horse is ready. - My horse... - I'd rather walk. - As you wish. - Some port, sir? - Port. Please, sir. Yes, sir. A bit cold this morning, isn't it? Yes, it's cold, but the sun shines. Have they already left for the fox hunt? Yes, it's the perfect day for a hunt. Where do you usually find these foxes? Hiding in the forest, around the lake... They can be anywhere. But no one knows their hideout? No, sir, only the dogs can find them. Dogs? These foxes aren't very smart. You're right, they're not very smart. I'm curious, I want to have a look. There they are! In Italy, the countryside gives you the idea of work. Hard work, sweat. But here all you feel like doing is lie down on this marvellous green carpet. Back we go! What are they doing? What are they doing? Running after me? Can't they see me? What are they doing? Oh my God! My God! Up we get. Some fall. Are you hurt? If it hurts, it will heal. Up on the saddle, my young girl. Yes, colonel. Jump up, quick. On your saddle! Jump. Colonel! Saddle hurts, saddle heals. Jump up, quick! On your saddle! Marquis! What are you doing there alone? - Taking a stroll. - Did you fall off your horse? - I never got on it, dear. - Come here. Yes, Your Grace. Welcome. Get in. We can follow the hunt more comfortably. Do you like it? It's wonderful sight. - It's like an old engraving from... - England? Yes, England. I was admiring the beauty of your countryside when I was involved in an accident. Poor little thing. Who is that little girl? - My niece. - What personality! You Italians indulge your children far too much. - Do you have any? - Yes, a boy and a girl. Send them to England, we'll ship them back tough as iron. I don't doubt it! - Marquis, do you love hunting? - I adore it. It's a shame you don't ride with the others, you'd enjoy it. I rode a lot in my youth, unfortunately, a Cossack struck me in my thigh. - Poor Marquis. - Forget it. I bless that Cossack who permitted me to be here with you. God, what now? - They found it. - I can't bear to see them suffer. - The foxes? - No, the dogs, poor things. If they don't eat the fox, they suffer. I was telling the Marquis that Italians behave with children like we behave with animals. It's quite absurd. I find it more correct to have the children sleep in kennels and the dogs in the children's beds. - Man is a dog's best friend. - A woman's, too. - I'd send them running after the fox. - Who? The children. To build up their muscles. Tell me, Marquis, do you prefer children or dogs? - Children... - Children. - Dogs? - Naturally. I find that if a dog is nice, it's nice. - But a child is always a child. - I never thought of it like that. - Marquis. - Yes, Your Grace? What do you think of Chinese children? - They're better than dogs? - No! I heard that the Chinese eat dogs. I don't understand why no one loves China? The Chinese I met were terribly kind. - I don't know why. - I know why. They're kind because they're poor. Are in you in the navy? - No, I'm not in the navy. - Marquis... My husband always says that a banker should only lend money to those who don't need it. You're husband's quite right! What do they say in Rome about this pope who's always travelling? I don't know, I'm from Perugia. - Are you in aviation? - No, I'm not in aviation. - I said it was a lovely day. - Yes, wonderful! And it was wonderful yesterday too. Yes, indeed! And even the day before yesterday. The day before yesterday absolutely not! - No? - The day before that. I'm sorry, my mistake. The day before that. - Are you with the diplomatic corps? - No, I'm not from the corps. Is it true Italian men don't let their wives work? - It depends. - Why? Because Italian men are very jealous. What do you know, child? We're always talking about Italian men at college. The youth of today. - Are you a jealous man? - Not me! Then your wife is ugly. No, my wife is very beautiful. - All Italians beat their wives. - No, not all of them. I'd never hit a woman, not even with a flower. You're so romantic. - I'm an Italian. - How the world has changed. Can you tell me why there's floods in Italy and the sunshine in England? Atomic bombs! - Are you a nuclear physicist? - Colonel... My dears, shall we have a coffee? What are you doing? Are you going with the women? - Shouldn't I? - The port. The port! How silly of me! I was going with them, I'd forgotten all about it! - No, pour yourself some! - No, after you! No, you have to pour your own, by Jove! Very kind of you. Would anybody else like some? We'd all like some. - Please... - By Jove, what you're doing? Don't wave it around! Just pass it around the table! What are you doing? Passing it to your right? Should I pass it to my left? Don't you know port should be passed like the hands of a clock? What a fool. I'd forgotten. Like the hands on a clock. Sometimes one thinks of a clock and... And then turns. Singing along are you? You sing like an angel, young lady. My Lord, Her Grace is waiting for you. Her Grace is calling me. Here I am. Women 500, children 100. Why only 35 military men? Not many military men visit the castle. - They go dancing on Sundays. - How foolish. The elderly are fonder and fonder of our beautiful Belvoir Castle. Your Grace, here I am! Marchese, please, sit down. I'll be with you in a minute. At your leisure. Women 725, Friday was a little slow. - What was the weather like? - Good. I really don't understand why, then. I would reintroduce tea time, like we used to do. At a small fee, of course. Mine is there too. - I'm sure... - Forget it. Here's our Lautinio. Wonderful. ...It's a problem we should look into. What do you think, Marquis? - I'd rather not say. - Why? Don't you like it? What does that mean? It's a fake? Are you sure? And it's a bad imitation too. If you'll allow me... Look at the difference. - Do you see the difference? - No. No? What is it now? Is the aunt fake too? - The aunt too. - Heavens! That one too! - Couldn't you tell? - I saw it from a distance. My God! I'm ruined. I'd already fixed the date for the Etruscan art exhibition. The invitations have already been sent out. The guests will arrive next weekend. Everything's been organised. And I'd promised to give it to her as a gift. Promised who? Your Grace, allow me to show my gratitude for your great hospitality and kindness. What do you intend to do? - Show me to the kitchen. - The kitchen? - Why? - Don't ask, just trust me. Go, dear. A secret of his. He promised me not even an expert will be able to tell the difference. - It's wonderful. - But what's he doing? He's preparing the sauce, then he'll boil it. His father was an archaeologist and a friend of the King of Sweden. They did many excavations together and made great discoveries too. Not even the greatest experts ever recognised his fakes. Remarkable. Now he's cooking the sauce. The marquis says a statue is like the human body. The richer the sauce, the older it gets. Only four people in the world know this recipe. Was it his father's recipe? No, his wife's. And tomorrow... we shall wake them up two thousand years older. Why are you laughing, child? Don't touch me. - Doesn't she like me? - Don't worry about her, Marquis. I was afraid of men too as a child. - Then I had 7 husbands. - No! Yes. - The oven keys. - Thank you, Marquis. - Good night, see you in the morning. - See you in the morning. Do you really want to wait until tomorrow morning? See you later. Count Bolla, would you ever have imagined? Would you like some port? To the right? No, clockwise. My God! What's this? "The Lady in her tower under the stone castle cannot sleep." "Her bed is so empty, the house of games is pink like the aurora." "Come, my dear, come "and play a little with me". Who is it? Of course I'll come, my dear. Who is it? It's you, marquis. It's you, Your Grace. Of course it's me, do you want something? - Not me. - Then what are you doing here? What am I doing here? I was passing by and now I'm going. Where are you going? That's not the way out. It isn't? Where, please? If you want to go to your room, go through that door. Goodnight and sweet dreams. Would you like me to read you two verses from the bible? I'm so sorry, but I'm a Catholic. Poor boy. "The desert is a solitary place". "And the desert will bloom like a rose "and the lion will lie next to the lamb". They're mannequins. The pink house. That's the pink house. Beautiful. The house of games is red like the aurora. Come, my dear, come and play with me. Who was it? Who can it be? I was sleeping. A sort of nightmare. Tell Your Grace I'll be down in 5 minutes. Very good, My Lord. What a night! Who is the divine lady who couldn't sleep? And you smoked Gauloises in the pink house while you waited in vain to play a little with me? Bravo, marquis, finally... - Did you sleep well? - I didn't sleep a wink. - I wanted to see the sunrise. - But there was no sun this morning. Yes, it was there, but then it disappeared. Marquis, I'm so keen to see our two friends again that I can't wait to go into the kitchen with you. - But eat something first. - No thank you, your grace... but I'm ready. Whenever you want? Beautiful ladies, sleep well? - I didn't sleep a wink. - You, too? - I slept marvellously. - Lucky you. It's a beautiful day today. Thank you. No, I'd like some French cigarettes, very strong. I'm looking for them, but I don't know who smokes them. - What? - Gauloises. Why not? Don't you like them? - Let's go. - Let's go. This is impossibile! - Good morning, dear. - Good morning, auntie. - You're so lucky to sleep for so long. - Innocent dreams. While we... So how are things over here? - We're all anxious. - Do not worry. Another fifteen seconds. All destroyed. Damn you! Come! After him! - He mustn't get away. - Here we are, auntie. Give me that! Damned Italian cad. I'll kill you. Aim! Oh my! - Got him. - Brilliant, well done. We didn't hit him! Damn him, he's getting away. Come on, you, men! To the artillery! Ready to fire! Fire! Steady! Her Grace returns your luggage with her disgust. Disgust? But I have no idea what went wrong with the sauce. It's your tomatoes, they don't ripen in England. - I'll inform Her Grace. - Do tell her it wasn't my fault. May I? Lady Elizabeth? What would you advise me to do to be forgiven by Her Grace? There's nothing to forgive, they were both fakes. But Her Grace had promised them to Her Majesty. What majesty? Everyone knows she buys fakes. She's swindled so many people. - Really? - Really. - That's wonderful. - Suit yourself! What a fantastic old lady. She has all my admiration. Forgive me, Ms. Elizabeth. Is it a very interesting book? What is it? A novel? It's a ministerial report on young people's sexual experiences. - What ministry? - The ministry of health. And what does a ministry ask? If you've ever been in love? - They don't ask such foolish questions. - Sorry. They asked precise things, they asked technical questions. For example... "What reaction did you have during your first sexual experience?" And the answer? "48% - I enjoyed it, 14% - let down". "Another 14% - no reaction". No reaction? Unbelievable. Excuse my curiosity, but do your parents allow you to read such things? I've never asked them, my mother is in America with her third husband. My father lives in Spain and I haven't seen him for years. - I'm sorry, you must feel lonely? - Why? Am I ugly? That's not what I meant, you're very beautiful. Very gracious, I wanted to say... - that you must miss family life? - I'm doing just fine without it. Isn't it dangerous for a girl to live alone? Are you alluding to sexual temptations? No? "25% of girls had their first sexual experience in their parent's house". During their absence, I hope? Are you against sex before marriage? It's not a problem that concerns me, I'm already married. And I have two kids. Here they are... Carluccio and Teresa. Teresa is your age. - Which is? - 15. I'm much older. Why are they so fat? I don't know. - They take after their mother. - Do you like fat women? No. Cigarette? Thank you, I only smoke Gauloises, they're stronger. - Gauloises. - Yes. Have you already arrived? Yes. When are you going back to Italy? Unfortunately, I leave tonight. - Well... - Well? - Bon voyage. - I hope we'll meet again. Miss Elizabeth, you forgot your book. Keep it, you can learn a lot about English youth. Yes. Elizabeth. Dante, she's only a child. How can you think certain things? But didn't you see her eyes? So deep and pure. Think of Teresa. She could be your daughter too. But as she wasn't my daughter and wasn't as young as I thought... It upset me that I hadn't understood this earlier. So, I decided to delay my departure... and visit her at her college. It would be foolish to leave England without visiting an English college. - Does your daughter speak English? - No, is it necessary? It doesn't matter, you see... This is the winter uniform with a felt hat. - In summer they wear a straw hat. - Very pretty. - Go, my dear. - Very cute! Marquis. By the way, could I see Miss Elizabeth Ruthford? Unfortunately, little Elizabeth has left us. - She's gone to live in Richmond. - Richmond? Yes, an island populated with of modern youngsters, a youth club. It's hard to resist the allure of the good life. We do try our best, I was young too once. It might seem strange to you, but I was and I know how hard it is to resist temptation. As an Italian you know what I'm alluding to, what do you Italians say? - What do we say? - Ciao! - What? - Ciao! It's the only word I learnt in Italy. - You'll pay twenty pounds deposit. - Twenty pounds? Don't mention anything to Her Grace about Elizabeth. Not to worry, I shan't be seeing Her Grace for some time. Good, because I deplore what Elizabeth has done. But as a woman, I'll tell you, Marquis... Let's go to the Richmond Youth Club tonight. These modern rhythms excite me! - Let's go to Richmond. - Me too! Me too. I'm only looking for someone. Give me 4 shillings and you can look for anyone you like. - 4 Shillings! - Yes. Sir, wait a minute! What you doing? What are you doing here? I received a message, "The house of games is pink like the Aurora." "Come my dear, come and play a little with me." - You're a bit late. - Yes, I should've guessed sooner. But, as we Italians say, better late than never. So I decided to come looking for you, do you mind? What do you think of this new England? - Somewhat shocked? - No, only... - What? - A little uncomfortable. - Do you feel old? - A little. - Am I too old for you? - No... If you didn't dress like a protestant pastor, you'd feel younger. Don't you like it? It's an authentic London smoke grey suit. I don't like it. That's better. What do you want to drink? A beer? - A beer? - Two beers, Ringo. How did you find out I was here? - I went to your college. - Surprised not to find me? My school friends are cut, aren't they? - What do you think of the head mistress? - She's remarkable. Hey, guys... - We're going to Diana's house. - Let's go, Dante. - Where? - You'll enjoy it. Really? Let's go. Look who's here! I found it again. I'm Cedrick, Diana's husband. Dante Fontana. - Are you Spanish? - No, Italian. Italian! It's a pleasure to meet you. Have you signed my wall? Wall? No. Where's the wall? - Right here. - There! I'll sign it. - Dante Fontana. - Great. Let's find a seat downstairs. I must take care of you, you're new here. We always have a party on Friday, here or in the countryside. My wife adores the youth and I can't say she's wrong. - You're right. - They're so alive! - Alive. - Have a seat. Tell me, why do you dress in that horrendous fashion? I'm sorry but I didn't think it would startle you so much. But you? You dress so differently to traditional English fashion. I apologise if I make you aware of an error, Mr. Fontana. - Yes, tell me? - Not traditional but conventional. Our aim is to merge fashion and tradition. It's something the young feel and understand. Conventional. They try to forgive the sins of their grandparents, who were responsible for the most horrendous clothing that man ever adopted since the stone age. Look at yourself. You're a young well-proportioned man, strong arms, muscles in your legs. And what have you become? A shapeless form. - Sorry, I didn't know... - It's alright, we're leaving anyway. - Would you come with me, Dante? - Yes, I'm coming. Bye. This way. Dante? Would you be so kind as to close the door? Please take off your clothes. - No, I'm sorry... - Please take off your clothes. I said no. I thought you wanted to talk. It's just an experiment, to see how you look. - A mere curiosity. - What curiosity? I want you to try on some new English fashion. New English fashion? Is your fashion men or women? Female and male fashion don't exist anymore... Fortunately, the difference between the sexes is disappearing. Take the men who are here tonight, for example. They could quite easily be mistaken for women. - Right! That's the danger. - Danger? - What danger? - Mistaking a man for a woman. You Italians say that people learn through their mistakes. We learn, but we're still not used to this. - I know, it takes time. - Yes. Cedrick, have you got... Dante, what are you doing? What am I doing? Ask Cedrick. She's asking what I'm doing. Go away, Elizabeth, it's supposed to be a surprise. - So, what are you doing? - It's supposed to be a surprise, he says. - Can you notice the difference? - Sure I do! How would you prefer your hair? Brown or blonde? - What? - The wig, naturally... Your outfit wouldn't be complete without it. Look at me. - But your hair is... - My hair? Rubbish... A wig. Dante! Is that you? - You like it? - Yes. - Am I like one of you? - Yes. - What will they think of me? - They don't think. It's like you never existed for them. - And for you? - For me, yes. - And you'll always love me? - No. - Why not? - I might find someone else tomorrow. - And I'll remain alone? - Look around. Look. - Who is she? - Who cares? - What does she want? - A kiss. - Really? - Sure. - May I? - Naturally. - Is this the freedom you spoke of? - Yes. I'll kiss you. Why are you doing that? Does it upset you? - No. - Then why are you scratching me? - Because I like you. - Are you jealous? We don't know what jealousy is? We're free. Look around, lots of girls are more attractive than me. All free to be loved. This is great. We're like nature, we're like the trees... Like the grass, the flowers. - Like the animals? - Sure. Where are we off to? Where's Elizabeth? Elizabeth? Come on. Do you want to wait for Elizabeth or are you coming with me? Elizabeth? I'm coming with you! Where are we off to? So, who's that young brown man who left with Elizabeth? He's a very famous writer. He killed four people, but they absolved him... because there was too much evidence against him... so it didn't seem possible that he was the killer. But if everyone knows he's the killer why don't they send him back to prison? In England, once you been absolved, even if you shout out you're guilty they don't believe you anymore. - Isn't Elizabeth scared of him? - No, she's very brave. - You too? - I'm a sensitive solitary girl. I need love and affection. - May I give it to you? - Yes. - What's your name? - Angel. I'm not dreaming then. - I really am in heaven. - Of course. I knew it, I should've come to London a long time ago. - Rolando, look at the guy! - Look at that hat. Look at that hairstyle. Which of these three is the man? - How can they go around like that? - Haven't you seen them before? He goes around like that and no one says anything? - Damn him... - Him, you and your grandfather. - Did you hear that? - I heard it but, who was it? I don't know, but we'd better leave. Let's go, everyone! It's great here. Do you come to this pub often? I'm suddenly really hungry. It'd be great to spend the whole night with you, but I'm starving. Where? To the private room? Let's go. I'm so happy to be with you. What do you want to drink? That's a good start! You're all so dear. Where are we going? Wasn't it nice here? Where are we going, Where are you taking me? - Where are we going? - To the golf course. - You play golf? - We're not playing but we'll have fun. Really? We'll have fun? I'm so happy! You're wonderful. You make me feel so young. I feel like a kid again. Come on, hurry up! - Come on, Dante, let's go. - Yes, I'm coming. Wait for me! I'm coming. Is this the golf course? It's wonderful, I'm so happy. - Who are they? - The Rockers! What are they doing? A show? You'll soon find out! - What are we going to do now? - Fight as hard as you can. But watch out, they're strong, smart and cruel. I don't understand. What do I have to do? Have you all gone mad? - Why are you doing this? - Because we like it. Looks like they're up to their usual games down there. It's an illness that makes youngsters behave like savages. A marvellous illness called youth. Because, my dear Mr. Smith, this is what it means to be young. A love of danger and adventure. What do you want from me, I'm out of this? So, will these lunatics be our successors one day? - Poor England. - We've done worse. The war. Look at this guy! What do you want from me? Easy now, easy... I don't know you. I haven't done anything to hurt you. I'm not like you, my name's Dante Fontana, I'm from Perugia. I'm not young like you, I'm old. I've got a wife and children, and I don't feel too good. Can't you find someone else? I feel a pain here. What are you doing? You're lifting me up. What a blow! You want to kill me? Leave me alone. Be nice, I'm out of this! The police. What a mess! I find such police intervention most deplorable. It's an abuse of power. Unworthy of a democratic country. - I agree with you. - Thank God. In a real democratic country the police should let these young imbeciles go, with so much hair and very little brains. Let them smash each other's heads in. Thanks for intervening. I don't know these youngsters. The suit and wig aren't mine either. They belong to Mr Cedrick. I'm Dante Fontana, antiquarian, and I must go back home to Perugia. My wife is waiting for me and I have a heart condition. What are you doing? Where are we going?
